Sophomore forward David
Burns, a key reserve in coach Bob
McKillop’s rotation, may have
turneda significant corner this week.

Notebook

Burns, who was a superlative
scorer at Bishop McGuiness High
School in Winston-Salem, is affec-

tionately known as “Instant Of- ©

‘fense” and “The Assassin” by
Davidson Radio Network announc-
ers Frank Santore and Charlie
Slagle.

: Scoring points

— and a lot of
them—has never
| been a problem.
| At times though,
defense, re-
bounding, ‘and
focus has.

But the 6’7”
leaper is gradu-
ally finding his niche and has made
real contributions to the team’s re-
cent three-game win streak.

“What a lift he gave us. He
came in and he just lit them up,”
said McKillop after the Citadel
game, in which Burns had 11 points
and two rebounds in 13 minutes of
action.

“He shot the ball great this week
in practice. I’m really encouraged.
He defended well and he got two
rebounds for us, and that was big.”

Burns was once again a worthy
topic of conversation after scoring
six points in 12 minutes vs. VMI.

“T think it’s just understanding
what his strengths are and how he
can put his strengths into the team,”
said the coach. “He’s a great shooter,
and he’s learned to defend and re-
bound now. He’s really focused on
those two things and let the offense
happen.”

Taking attendance

The Wildcats would set a new
Belk Arena attendance record by
drawing 15,078 fans over the final
four home dates — Thursday vs.
Siena, Saturday. vs. Furman, Feb.
10 vs. East Tenn. St., and Feb. 22
vs. App. Sti. Pe

That’s an average of 3,770 a
game, the chances of which are slim
to none considering Belk’s reputa-
tion as something less than a defini-
tive homecourt advantage.

“Tt’s atough market,” McKillop
said Monday. “Unfortuantely, a lot

of those (red) seats are sold, but the «

people aren’t coming. The Pan-
thers are done, and I think if we can
get the fans—— the Davidson alums
who have put the money out for
those tickets — to give them to
their children, their friends, that
will get people into the stands.”
“That’s so much a part of this
team’s success, to get that emo-
tional uplifting from the crowd. We
need that crowd to be that sixth man
for us. They were there for Missis-
sippi (a 59-56 win on Dec. 2) and I
don’t think they were there for

Marshall (an 85-81 loss on Jan. 8).
That was a big factorin the Marshall
debacle, that we didn’t have the
support because the crowd was so
sparse.

“So the students are back, (Di-
rector of Athletics Marketing &
Promotions) Alec (McAlister) and
(Game Management Director) Lee
(Sargent) are working at it. Let’s
hope that everyone comes out and
roots the ‘Cats on.”

Traveling man

Rookie phenom Landry
Kosmalski plays well all the time,
but he seems to take his game to an
ever higher notch on the road.

Since conference play started,
Kosmalski has averaged 20 points
and 9 rebounds per road contest,
and 9.25 and 5.75 at home.

His two finest collegiate ef-
forts to this point have come at App.
St. (23 and 10) and at The Citadel
(24 and 15).

In addition, Kosmalski opened
up the season and his career with a
16-point, 10-rebound double-
double vs.
Fairleigh-
Dickinson in
| Teaneck, N.J.,
and had 15 and
eight against
UMass in
Amherst, Mass.

Why the discrep-
ancy, Landry?

“T think the crowd being against
us kind of gets me pumped up,” said
the frontrunner for Southern Con-
ference Freshman-of-the-Year. “I
really like playing on the road. I
like sitting around in the hotel all
day, relaxing, and then coming out
and playing.”

Grand
Marshall

First-year f=
forward Stephen
Marshall. has
missed ten of the
19 games so far
this season with
Hepatitis A and
an ankle injury, but has nonetheless
managed to show signs of being a

Marshall

bruising, intimidating inside pres-

ence with a soft jumper.

AndifMcKillop’s early judge-
ment carries any weight (and there’s
no reason to believe it wouldn’t),
Marshall could one day in the not-
so-distant future be a star for
Davidson.

“Believe me, Stephen is going
to be a great player for us,” he said
Saturday night. “His talent I think
is going to open up a lot of peoples’
eyes.”

Cisco and Ton rebound

After both hav-
| ing their worst
outings of the sea-
son Monday
against The Cita-
del, Narcisse
Ewodo and Ali
Ton responded
with stellar per-
formances Satur-

day vs. VMI.

Ewodo scored 17 points and
grabbed a career-high 17 rebounds
in the 10-point
win over the [7
Keydets, while
Ton logged his | |
fourth double- |
digitassisteffort | %
of the season
with ten. 4

“T don’t |.
think Cisco ever ~
has anything to ;
prove,” said McKillop. “Cisco has
tremendous respect from every one
of his teammates and his coaching
staff.

_ “T think that’s a tribute to the
kind of person he is and the matu-
rity he has.”

Ewodo

' Downright defensive

One of the primary reasons for
the Wildcats’ current three-game
winning streak is improved defense.

In each of the wins — East
Tenn. St., The Citadel, and VMI —
Davidson has held its opponent un-
der 40% shooting from the field. .

“T am thrilled with the way we
have been mixing up the defenses,”
said McKillop. “It’s been nice that
we have been able to make the
transition from man-to-man to zone
during the course of a game.

“Defense has been the core to
our program’s success the past
couple of years. To be successful,
our defense needs to be aggressive
and it needs to create offensive op-
portunities. We’re beginning to do
that a little more.”

Making the freebies

_ While foul shooting may have
cost the Wildcats the first Marshall
game, they are starting to shine from
the charity stripe.

Since the Jan. 8 contest vs, the
Thundering Hérd when the Wild-
cats shot 44% from the line,
Davidson has shot at least 70% from
the line in each of its past seven
games.

“The percentage is not only
very good, but the numbers are very
good,” explained McKillop. “We
are starting to manufacture points
from the foulline.”

Against The Citadel, Landry

Kosmalski’s 13-of-14 performance

from the stripe carried Davidson to
the tight victory.

The Thunderless Herd

Davidson hopes Huntington is
as kind to them this ‘year a8 it was
last year.. ae

Davidson: handed Marshall a
106-57 thrashing last January, the
Herd’s worst home loss in their
history. eo
Brandon . Williams led
Davidson with 23 points that night,
the most astoundingly dominating
performance of many throughout
the team’s 25-5 campaign last sea-
son. : ;

The Wildcats grabbed 54 re-
bounds, had 14 steals, and shot 56%

from the field, and held the

Thunderless Herd to 35% shooting.

This article was reported by Michael
Kruse from Charleston, S.C., and
Daniel Motz from Davidson.

Citadel win from page 13

from the free throw line. Landry’s
proven that wrong,” said coach Bob
McKillop. “Come on, how many
guys get 15 rebounds in a game as a
freshman?

“One thing that’s not going to
show up in the stat sheet is he de-
fended Virgil Stevens (9 points),
one of the best one-on-one slashing
athletes in the conference. Landry’s
as tough as they come, freshman,
sophomore, junior, or senior.”

With just under 10 minutes left,
Noy Castillo, who paced The Cita-
del with 17 points, nailed one of his
five threes, falling out of bounds

-with the shot clock running down
- and upping the Bulldogs’ lead to a

game-high seven.

’ Just nine seconds later, with
momentum dramatically andmaybe
irreversibly shifting in The Citadel’s
favor, Kosmalski, without any hesi-

tation, drilled a crowd-silencing
three from the top of the key.

A Ton layup followed, and the
Wildcats were well on their way to
a second straight conference road
win,

Davidson’s bench ‘output was
also critical, spearheaded by 11
points in 13 minutes from David
Burns.

Stephen Marshall, in his first
action since an ankle injury kept
him on the sidelines for two-games,
had 7 points and 6 boards in 27
rhinutes, as starting pivotman Chadd
Holmes spent all but 14 minutes on
the bench due to foul trouble.

“They buried a couple of three-
pointers, the shift of momentum
really went into their direction, and
we didn’t back down,” said
McKillop. ‘We could’ve folded,
but we continued to attack and we
showed courage. A very, very good
win for us,”
