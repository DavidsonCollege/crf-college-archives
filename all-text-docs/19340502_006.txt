Freshman Foursome to
Engage Carolina Team

Under Coach Newton’s supervision,
the ’Kitten golfers are preparing for
their match with the freshman links-
men of Carolina, Saturday, May 5. The
match will be played at Chapel Hill.

Charlie Ross, of Charlotte, who will
play number 1, will also act as cap-
tain; Ralph McClelland, Atlanta, Ga.,
will play number 2, and Carter Gen-
nett, of Asheville, will play the num-
ber 3 position, The number 4 position,
between George Cowan and Tom Mc-
Kinney, had not been decided at the
time this paper went to press.

Coach Newton stated: “The fresh-
man golf team will play the Salisbury
High School, the State freshmen and
the Charlotte High School, but the
dates have not been arranged.”

Many of the Centennial linksmen
have filled positions.on other teams
and a successful year is expected.

Track Star Becomes
Subject for Poetry

The following poem appeared in the
Knoxville, Tenn., paper under the
heading of “Local Boy Makes Good,”
after Madison Armistead won second
place in the broad jump in the Ten-
nessee-Davidson track meet.

He threw himself into the air,

Where he landed we know not

where,
We do not know what became

We only know he leaped to fame.

If he will only cut out the dames
We're sure he’s headed for
Olympic Games,
And when he’s there among the créwd
We'll certainly know Lula will be
proud.

Student Injured When
Motorcycle Hits Auto

the

Joe W. Bailey, freshman at David-
son, received a fracture on his left leg
below the knee when he was struck
while riding a motorcycle near the out-
skirts of the city.

With the intention of buying a mo-
torcycle for use this summer, Bailey
was riding behind the driver's seat with
the owner driving the motorcycle on
the seat before him. While driving at

a moderate rate of speed on the
Mooresville highway, a car driving on
the left-hand side of the road ap-
proached so quickly that the occu-
pants of the smaller vehicle had no
chance to veer to the other side of the
road. A head-on collision occurred be-
tween the two, causing the motorcycle
to be thrown off the road.

Dr. J. W. MacConnell reported that
the owner of the motorcycle, Sherrill,
has severe cuts about his head and
legs and some brain concussion is
feared.

Those injured were brought to the
Davidson hospital and were treated by
Dr. MacConnell. The occupants of the
car were not injured.

mental and physical life,” said Nelson,
“but his spiritual life must become
well integrated.”

Fletcher spoke twice on subjects of
current interest. Speaking Saturday
morning on “Internationalism in Muni-
tions,” he revealed conditions in the
munitions racket whic henabled a num-
ber of arms works to influence the
attitude of the world toward world
peace. He deplored the activities of
the various arms works, Colt and
Bethlehem Steel in America, Arm-
strong in England, Krupp in Germany,
and Schneider in France.

One of the problems of peace-lov-
ing citizens today, he stated, is the
overcoming of the influence of the mu-
nition factories who by lobbying and
general propaganda are able to block
efforts toward world peace. Speaking
again Saturday night, Fletcher dis-
cussed the “Economic Situation.” He
outlined the credit system of the coun-
try and discussed international trade
and pointed out the difficulty of the
present capitalistic system's distribut-
ing trade surplus to those who are in
need of them.

Reverend Mr. Poteat, speaking to
the young people’s societies of Raleigh,
delivered the message Sunday morning.
He uttered a challenge to youth to step
fcrward in these distressing times and
sounded a note on internationalism,
not only as a way to peace, but as a
way to a more settled economic situa-
tion.

Following each talk, groups met to-
gether in free discussion of questions
brought up. W. M. Thompson as chair-

man of the men’s part in the confer-
ence presided over the Y. M. C. A.
group. At a banquet Saturday night
each college group sang its “Alma
Mater.” Davidson was represented in
this by a quintet.

Sam Wiley, secretary to the David-
son “Y,” led the devotional services
Sunday morning.

means in which no heat is given out.

This is a very new experiment in this

field, and has been the object of much

research and speculation.

The guests were entertained with a
contest in identifying odors common
to the chemical laboratory. Lynn Huie,
Addison Brenizer, and Prosser Morrow
were awarded prizes as being high
scorers in the contest. A feed and an
informal social gathering were enjoyed
afterwards by the guests and members.

Gamma Sigma Epsilon was founded
at Davdison College in 1919. It has
grown since that time to have chap-
ters in states all over-the-country, in-
cluding Florida, Alabama, Kentucky,
Wyoming, and New York.

INTER-FRATERNITY BASE-

BALL STARTED TUESDAY

(Continued from page 3)
worked for the Phi Delts.

Having received a bye in the first
round, the K. A.’s and Phi Gams mixed
in a game that was much closer than
the score indicates. Playing heads-up
ball, the Phi Gams led the score at
the end of the seventh, 17-9. They se-
cured an early lead and managed to
hold it until the game ended. The last
four innings of the game were much
closer than the first five, bringing out
some’good ball playing at times.“Mims
Rogers and Ed Wooten served as the
battery for the Phi Gams, while the
K. A.’s did not seem to be able to find
the right combination, using three
pitchers, Johnson, Hutchins, and Mc-
Callie, with Phil Cook behind the plate.

A first-round game between the S.
A. E.’s and the Kappa Phis was tied
at the end of the seventh, but with
the aid of the extra inning, the Pi
Kappa Phis defeated the opposing nine
10-9. The outcome of the game was
in doubt. until the last ball had been
thrown, and in the eyes of the specta-
tors the game was very well contested.
Ralph Smith and John Willis were the

hardest

Pi Kappa Phi’s battery, while Bill Reid
and Tom Marchant served for the
S. A. E.'s.

The semi-finals will be played off the
latter part of this week and the cham-
pionship will be decided the first of
next week.

The S. P. E. diamond stars and the
hard-hitting Pikas met Tuesday to de-
termine the lower bracket semi-final-
ist. The outcome of the game was not
known at the time of the publication
of this paper.

Wednesday afternoon there will be a
game between the Pi Kappa Phis and
the Beta Theta Pis. The Phi Gams
and Kappa Sigs will meet Thursday.

NATIONAL VOCATIONAL
CONFERENCE TO MEET
(Continued from page 3)

Hawes, James P. Warburg, Nancy Mc-

Clelland, and Governor A. Harry

Moore of New Jersey.

Among the other career fields to be
discussed the first few days will be
advertising, automotive industry, build-
ing,sinsurance, secretarial work, jour-
nalism, radio broadcasting, and others.
Law and medicine and_ specialized
fields which require three or four
years of training have been omitted.

Because it is expected that the at-
tendance will be extremely large, ad-
mission will be by ticket only. A lim-
ited number have been assigned to
each college, which will then distribute
them to the interested graduates. An-
nouncement will be made later con-
cerning the number of tickets David-
son College will receive.

An advisory board of 20 men out-
standing in the educational field will
direct the meeting, which is to be held
at the L. Bamberger and Company in
Newark.

AS FELIX-SEES ’EM
(Continued from page 4)
will have a nice competitor for the big-
time races, maybe the Penn relays, in
a couple of years.

Concerning the relays, the sports
department wishes to extend its
hearty felicitations to Captain Mil-
ler Cochrane for his third-place
heave in the discus event at the
Pennsylvania meet held in Phila-
delphia last week-end. Two other
North Carolina representatives,
Ralston L e of the University,
and Milton Zori, the man-moun-
tain sophomore from N. C. State,
set new relay marks in the javelin
and discus throws, respectively,
during the meet. Several other
Southern stars won prominence for
themselves while taking part in
this annual track rally, but David-
son is extremely proud of the ex-
cellent showing the Wildcat weight
star made in his event.

“The Broadcaster” probably expects
a rebuttal from this column for the
way in which he dragged the author
over the coals last week, but just as
a house divided against itself cannot
stand, so a newspaper printing con-
tradictory news will not make very
rapid progress. Therefore, with the
gentle warning not to rub me in such
a fashion any more, I grant you the
victory.
