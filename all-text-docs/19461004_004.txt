the Yellows were recuperating,
then for the Yellows to take over
for another spell, etc. I fell into
the Yellow category. As I have
already stated, this was to be a
square dance with such jingles as:

We docey-doe

Heel and toe,

With her heel

My accomplice upon the floor was

Eunice Bycupps. She might be
described as — CENSORED —
(Note: We feel that when Al
Capp publishes the picture of

“Lena the Hyena,” there will be
a striking resemblance to Eunice.
Ed.) <A few boys came up to
Eunice and patting her on the head
called her Polio, but I reminded
them that Polio was a dog and
that Eunice insisted upon standing
on all fours only when we were not
dancing.

I finally got my break — after
grappling with something (I call

night we sallied forth onto the
floor for more rug-cutting with?
“Swing your partner,
To and fro,
If not enough
Give ’er some mo’.”

The gym where the corn-fed
melee took place was decorated
with pennants of different colleges
and universities. Upon noticing the
red and black of Davidson flank-
ing the flag of Queens I was re-
minded of the recent swing hit,
“Pickle in the Middle” (courtesy of
Petrillo.)

At 11:00 sharp the fiddles and
their bass (not base) mother had
seen their best hours of plucking
so their keepers packed them up
in straw along with the blow jugs
and started back to the farm. On
arriving at Davidson about 12:00,
we staggered to our respective
rooms to take turns in bandaging
our wounds and adjusting our first-
aid splinters. However, we con-
sider ourselves “worldly” men now

for the informal to be held on the
night of the second, following the
Davidson-W. and L. game, are in-
complete. Music for the formal is
to be by a band of national stand-
ing, but is as yet unannounced.

Due to the inadequate facilities on
the campus at the present time, fac-
ulty permission for holding such
founctions off-campus has_ been
granted. This is to be in effect
until dance facilities are available
on the college campus, adequate to
accommodate the students and their
guests.

“Some definite quality of distinc-
tion, whether in intellect, character
or personality, or in any combina-

tion of them, is the most important
requirement for a Rhodes Scholar-
ship. Financial need does not con-
stitute a special claim for consid-
eration.

“There is no restriction.on a
Rhodes Scholar’s course of study.
The University of Oxford offers
about the same variety of instruc-
tion as any large American univer-
sity. Rhodes Scholars are appoint-
ed for two years in the first in-
stance, with a possibility of a third
year for a man who has made a
good record, and who presents a
plan of study for that period satis-
factory to his college and to the
Rhodes Trustees.

“The stipend of the Rhodes
Scholars will remain for the pres-
ent at 400 pounds as it was before
the war. Many Rhodes Scholars
will receive an addition to this
stipend through measures analo-
gous to the GI Bill of Rights. The
Trustees have voted that any
Rhodes- Scholar not in receipt of
such an augmentation to his stipend
will be granted during the year
1946 to 1947 a special allowance,

bringing his total up to 500 pounds.
In addition Rhodes Scholars going
to Oxford for the first time will
receive from the Rhodes Trust a
refund of one half of their steam-
ship fare.” -

Anyone interested in this schol-
arship may obtain information and
application blanks from Dr. Vowles,
who is the representative of Rhodes
Scholarships at Davidson, from C.
C. Walker, Esq., Wachovia Bank
and Trust Company, Winston-

mittee of Selection in North Caro-
lina,. or from Dr. Aydelotte at
Princeton.
