THE DAVIDS: ONIAN

Artists Adam Straus and John Monteith
dredge up things we would like to stay hid-
den: careless consumerism and bad year-
book pictures.

Straus’s work makes my fingers tingle
with excitement—he uses the really really
good colors in the Crayola box, and wel-
comes fuchsia, goldenrod, teal, and thistle to
his canvases. With child-like exuberance he
loads on the paint, adding dimension to his
pieces.

Straus chooses to frame his work in lead
and steel, emphasizing that the canvas is not

_ the big picture, but only a moment captured.

Straus even paints one of his frames; by
extending the golden glow beyond the pe-
rimeters of the canvas, we wonder where the
painting ends and the frame begins. Icouldn’t
help looking for extension:cords because I
was sure the ethereal skies were backlit. I
was wrong.

My favorite piece, “Man on Top of the
World”, places a tiny background figure far
away from the Budweiser can and cigarettes
and trash in the foreground. A flower blooms
in between the rubbish and under another
brilliant cloudscape.

Straus paints postcards of beauty while
reminding us that the dirtiness is still there. It
struck me how disgusting the brightest, most
glorious colors look in neon signs and crass
containers of modern convenience. Straus’ s
work is best described in the title of one of his
pieces, “The Dark Side of a Once Green
Place.” Beyond the verdant pastures he
includes the toxic run-off that we all know
exists.

John Monteith might seem someone with
an excess of time on his hands. Actually, he
has photography ink on them.

Upwards of 40 images
in each work exhibit berserk
makeovers; a cardigan-clad
mug cycles through various
androgynous stages aided by
lipstick, dark curls, ribbons,
and smutty eyes. The origi-
nal masculine image trans-
forms into Marilyn Manson,

Boy George, and that princi-

pal from Grease. There are
sO many Variations on one
picture that each work, in its
entirety, blurs the individual.

Faces stare out from John Monteith’s work

dramatically alter the images that Monteith
uses. One realizes how very generic yearbook
pictures are—rather than a cause of grief,
these mugs should be a source of amusement.

Each face seems a reject, and the large col-
lages of rejects are very comforting—c’ mon,
we all hate those people who take perfect
yearbook pictures anyway.
