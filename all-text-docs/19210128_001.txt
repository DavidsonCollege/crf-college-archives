18 MEN ACES ON HONOR ROLL

iors Lead List With Grand Total

SeniorNine Students Who Made
Over 95 Per Cent.

The honor roll representing those that
have attained an average grade of at
least 95 per cent for the fall term has
just been announced. The large number
from the Senior class is accounted for in
part by the fact that under a rather re-
cent ruling of the faculty those Seniors
that have a sessional grade of 85 per
gent are not required to stand the final
examination on the individual subject
concerned, and hence it is much easier
to reach 95 per cent than under the for-
mer regulation.

Further, Seniors of course know how
to study to better advantage and have
the privilege to a larger extent than the
lower classmen of choosing what studies
they will pursue.

The following is a list of honor roll
men:

Cassell, J. E. Christiansburg, Va., 98.17.

Juniors Wallop Sophs by
23-6 Score

Erwin, Moore and Dick Star for Jun-
iors—Tucker and Sorrells
for Sophs

The inter-class gridiron season had an
auspicious beginning last Saturday when
the Juniors and Sophs met on Sprunt
Field in their annual football classic.
The game fully upheld the traditions of
former class battles and was a fight
from start to finish with the Juniors
emerging victorious by a 23-6 score.

When the teams took the field, they
appeared to have the weight on their
opponents, and later Coach McFadden’s
charges displayed an ability and fight-
ing spirit that could not be denied. The
Sophs were unable to penetrate the
famous “graveyard defense” put up by
the Juniors, and time after time were
forced to kick. The first score was
made in the opening quarter when by
steady plugging the Juniors took the
ball up to a place from which Luke
Erwin romped across with the first six
points, adding another one in a minute.
The second touchdown, coming in the
first few minutes of the second frame,
was the result of a pretty pass from
Dick to Erwin, who negotiated the re-
maining 20 yards in fine style. He then
added his fourteenth point with another
goal.

In the second semester, the Sophs, re-
juvenated by the intermission, came
back with determined efforts to stem
the tide of defeat. The Juniors receiv-
ed, but a minute later John Grey, the
speedy left end of the Sophs, scooped up
a fumble behind the line of scrimmage
and raced 40 yards for their only touch-
down of the day. A violated technical-
ity kept them from a chance at goal.
The next advance of the Juniors was
stopped on the four yard line by firm

bates to be Held
This Spring

Wake Forest and Mercer to Be Met in
Forensic Contest—Prelimi-
naries Feb. 18

The scene of conflict shifts for the
time from the arena of athletics to the
arena of forensic struggles.

Davidson will have two inter-collegi-
ate debates this spring. The first of
these will be against Wake Forest, and
will probably be held in Greensboro on
the 1st day of April. The second it with
Mercer University, of Macon, Ga., and
will be held in Spartanburg, S. C., April
2oth.

The subject of these debates is, “Re-
solved, that the United States should
cancel the loans made to her Allies dur-
ing the great world war.” This subject
was proposed by Davidson, her op-
ponents having the choice of sides. At
this writing no sides have been chosen.

Preliminaries for the inter-collegiate
debate will be held in the Society Halls,
February 18th, and the semi-finals in
Shearer Hall, March 4th. Two teams of
two men each are to be selected, with
two alternates. This debate is open to
every member of either Literary So-
ciety, and you are urged to come out
and try for a place on the team if you
have any ability at all along the debat-
ing line.

It has been some years since Davidson
has met Wake Forest in a debating con-
test, and this one is looked’ forward to
with eager anticipation. Mercer has
been met for the last two years, David-
son winning in '19., and Mercer winning
last year. This debate will break the
tie, and Davidson is anxious to have it.

The preliminaries of the Fresh-Soph
debate will be held in the respective So-
ciety Halls on February 14th. The finals
will be held in Shearer Hall, March 7th.
The subject for the debate is. “Resolved,
that the Smith-Towner Education Bill
should be adopted.”

This debate is open to all Freshmen
and Sophomore members of the two Lit-
erary Societies, and everyone is urged
to go out and try for a place on one of
the teams. In the preliminaries, each
society selects a team of three with one
alternate, irrespective of classes. These
teams meet in Shearer Halil on March
ath.

Each society awards a medal to the
best individual debater on its team.

Has Won Warm Place in Hearts of
All Davidson Men Since Be- -
gunning His Work Here

Thomas Guerdon Hearn, Major of In-
fantry, United States Army, is now at
the head of the department of Military
Science and Tactics of Davidson Col-
lege. . Major Hearn is a native of Ala-
bama, having been born near Tuskegee,
that state, in the late eighties.

Major Hearn entered Auburn with the
class of 1913 and remained there for two
years. While at Auburn he was very
much interested in debating and literary
society work. Leaving Auburn, Major
Hearn entered West Point with the
class of 1915, with which he was gradu-
ated as cadet lieutenant. While at the
academy Major Hearn was on the foot-
ball squad for one year and also an
entrant in the annual indoor meet as a
member of a tug-of-war team. During
his Senior year he was superintendent
of the Children’s Sunday School of the
post and in 1914 he was the academy's
representative to the general Y. M. C. A.
conference at Northfield, Mass.

A glance at Major Hearn's “write-up”
in the 1915 “Howitzer"—the West Point
annual—gives us some interesting side-
lights on his character: “Nothing can
make him sore except to mention the
fact that it was Booker T. Washington
that put Tuskegee on the map.” Like-
wise the 1915 “Howitzer” informs us that
Major Hearn is an A.B. of West Point.
Now don’t assume, as did one of our
professors, that he holds a Bachelor of
Arts degree—ask the Major about it
sometime, and if he's feeling good per-
haps he will tell you the story, taking
particular care to inform you that it is
not a B.A. degree.

On the 19th day of December, 1917,
Major—then Captain—Hearn was mar-
ried to Miss Charlotte F. Jadwin, a
daughter of Gen. Edgar Jadwin, of the
Corps of Engineers, U. S. Army. Mrs.
Hearn is here with her husband.

Since his graduation from West Point
Major Hearn has specialized. on the
machine gun. He has done “post-grad-
uate” work on his favorite gun at the
Infantry School of Arms at Fort Sill
and in several of the verious staff
schools that were conducted overseas.
For a time while at Camp Forrest, Ga.,
he was second senior instructor in the
automatic rifle school and while over-
seas was one of the three judges at the
great inter-army Machine Gun Meet at
Le Mans, France, in 1919. Overseas
Major Hearn commanded the Sixteenth
Machine Gun Battalion of the Sixth Di-
vision.

Upon graduation from West Point as
a second lieutenant of infantry Major
Hearn was assigned to the Sixth Infan-
try, then stationed on the Mexican
border. His regiment, as a unit of Per-
shing’s famous Punitive Expedition,
hiked 360 miles into the interior of Mex-
ico and back again. From the Sixth In-
fantry Major Hearn was soon trans-
ferred to the Fifty-third Infantry, and
from the Fifty-third to the Sixteenth
Machine Gun Battalion of the Sixth Di-
vision.

With the Sixteenth Machine Gunners
he trained at Camp Forrest, Ga., and
later at Camp Wadsworth, S. C. The
Sixteenth sailed from Hoboken for
England in July, 1918. While at a rest
camp in England Major Hearn had the
tare privilege of listening to an address
by Rudyard Kipling, the greatest living
English man of letters. “His personal-
ity is compelling, magnetic—he made an
unforgettable impression on me,” was
the way Major Hearn expressed him-
self.

ADDITIONAL SEATING
FACILITIES PROVIDED
FOR IN GYMNASIUM

No doubt the students will hear with
pleasure the glad tidings that the gym-
nasium has at last been equipped with
three tiers of seats in the gallery. Those
unfortunate ones among us who have
had to go through the unpleasant and
disagreeable sensation of standing dur-
ing an entire basketball game will re-
joice now that this ordeal is a thing of
the past.

The need of an arrangement of this
kind has been long felt, especially dur-
ing the last year or two, due to the
large increase in our student body and
to the added number of basketball games
played on the hill. Then, too, many of
us have been forced to sit on the floor
every Saturday night at the “movies.”
In every available chair two to three
students are crowded like sardines and
every now and then a bench groans and
cracks under its added burden, while
occasionally one crashes.to the floor,
much to the surprise and discomfort of
its occupants, who ruefully pick them-
selves up amid the jeers of their de-
lighted neighbors.

Now that adequate seating arrange-
ments have been provided, pictures can
at last be seen with.some degree of per-
sonal comfort.

Davidson Loses to Dur-
ham “Y” in Open-
ing Game

Visitors Furnish Best Exhibition of
Team Work Ever Seen on
Local Court

Davidson took the short end of a 41
to 16 score in the first game of the sea-
son with the Durham Y. M. C. A. team.
In this game the ofd Davidson fighting
spirit was displayed but that could not
overcome the advantage in size and
teamwork that the “Y” quint had. This
“V" from the town whose name is al-
ways associated with the ancient and
honorable “Taurus,” was composed of
old college stars, men of stature, experi-
ence and basketball instinct, and with-
out a doubt it is the best team in the
two Carolinas.

The game started with all the ginger
and pep that both teams could put into
it, each eager to make the first goal and
thus gain the advantage. Durham ob-
tained the lead in the first minute of
play, never to be headed. The rooters
were loud in their support of the Wild-
cats but not stinted in their praise of
the “Y" team’s good work. Their style
of play coupled with hard passing and
accurate shooting presented an unbeat-
able combination against which the “Red
and Black” quintet fought hard, and at
tinles seemed to have conquered.

For Davidson, Roberts and Romefelt
were the mainstays and the point gath-
erers, while for Durham “Y,” Starling
and Knight were the chief scorers. The
game was remarkably free from fouls,
the Durham team not committing even
a technical foul during the whole game,
and the Davidson five only two or three.

Line-up:

Davidson. Position. Durham “Y”
Roberts (6) .-...-- RF-....... Perry (10)

Marked Success Attends
First Life Work
Campaign

Large Number of Students Hear Im-
pressive Messages of Dr. Thompson

The Davidson conference marks the
beginning of the Life Work Conferences
which will be held at the various Pres-
byterian colleges throughout the South.
Full preparation was made for the con-
ference here. Several weeks ago Rev.
Edward E. Lane, the Life Work Secre-
tary of our Southern Presbyterian
Church, who is in charge of these con-
ferences, was on the hill organizing
prayer groups and arranging inter-
views. During the conference practi-
cally every floor in the college conduct-
ed a short prayer meeting at 10 o'clock
each night, and over a hundred personal
interviews were held between different
students and the conference leaders.

Dr. Tolly Thompson, ‘05, an old Da-
vidson man, held the conference here.
Every mecting was marked by a large
attendance and a deepening interest
among those present. The interview
hours were crowded. The general im-
pression among most of the students
seems to be that these meetings were
the best ever held on the hill.

Thureday Night.

Dr. Thompson built his first address
Thursday night on the passage, “I call
you not servants but friends.” He stated
that we formed our friendships in pro-
portion to the personal worth of our
associates or in proportion to the
amount of good they could do us or we
could do them. He then proposed to
study our relations with Christ under
these heads.

Christ, the speaker said, embodies all
those qualities which we most admire
in our friends. He was absolutely truth-
ful, even when on trial for His life. He
was unselfish, spending His whole life
for others. He was brave, and absolute-
ly fearless when supporting some great
religious truth. He was spotlessly holy,
as the demons themselves bore witness.
And His whole life was filled to the
brim with love for the children, for His
disciples, and even for His enemies.
Was ever such a man as this?

Again, a man's service to you, said Dr.
Thompson, is of value according to the
amount of good it does you and accord-
ing to the cost at which the service was
rendered. Christ has given us the most
priceless gift in the world: He has re-
vealed to us the value of our souls and
opened a way to us whereby we may
gain salvation. And He has done this
for us at the expense of the greatest
agony, physical, mental, and spiritual,
