Sperm Banking
Comes To Davidson

After a very satisfying drive
last year, the Charlotte Sperm
Bank will return to Davidson
College again this week in
hopes of surpassing last year’s
record 1500 vials.

Jack Offenheimer, coordina-
tor for the organization, said
that events will take place in
Chamber Dining Hall between
the hours of 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.

If Davidson again surpasses
the 1000 vial goal, the school
will be qualified for the group
sperm plan which provides free
sperm protection in case of sud-
den increases in radioactivity,
castration or big weékend ex.
haustion.

“I hope many of the same
guys as last year come again
Offenheimer said. ‘‘Frankly we
were a little overwhelmed at
the response we received last
year. But I guess being isolated
the way you are... well .
you know what I mean.”

Offenheimer’s only request is
that the students remain order.
ly while waiting in line. Last
year’s pushing and shoving,
sticking and poking will not be
tolerated.

“Its understandable that boys
would get a little overexcited at
such times, and maybe a little
over eager,” he said. ‘“‘But such
lack of self control puts us in
a very sticky situation with
everyone concerned.

Bruce also indicated that C.

world renowned magic act. ‘It’s
Breat to see that Shaw will be

Everyone has really loved it in
the past.”

The weekend will mark Dav-

alumni association, chaired by
Mac McLaughlin of Oregon,

The Saturday Concert fea-

Bruce indicated that the group

Pin, they can do the slide for

_ Fraternity Awards Brinkley
‘Responsible Citizen’ Prize

Freshman scholastic frater-
nity, Phi Eta Sigma, long re-
cognized as a powerful force
on campus, has bestowed its
coveted Responsible Citizen
award for this year to Alan B.
Brinkley, professor of philoso-
phy.

Buzz Fly, president of the
fraternity, presented Brinkley
with a key to the library as well
as a gold-plated name stamp,
which the philosophy professor
symbolically used to check out
30 volumes of the Indian Cen-
sus to read that night after the
ceremony.

Brinkley, affectionately known
as the “bearded wonder” by
certain members of the admin-
istration, is primarily noted for
his constitutional documents
which responsibly champion the
rights of the faculty, as well as
for his letters to THE DAVID-
SONIAN which castigated dull-
witted editors for their journal-
istic irresponsibility.

drum band to hit Davidson since
the Trinidad Tripoli Esso Steel
Drum Band was here iast
spring.”

Again this year the idea of
big weekends has been chal-
lenged by several Davidson
students who would like to see
the social program spread out
over the course of the term,
with less emphasis on the ‘‘one
big bash.”

DAVIDSONIAN columnist Ce-
cil Burney has flatly stated
that he will not attend any of
the activities presently planned.
“I'd rather listen to a lecture
about Immanuel Kant than the
stuff we have this weekend. Its
really the principle of the thing
though,’ Burney said.

Although indicating that he
would not be on campus him-
self that weekend, Bruce said,
“We really anticipate a good
turnout. This is top level en-
tertainment that we've lined
up.”

Both Strong and Bruce did
Say that the weekend selected
may hurt attendance for Mid-
winters.

“At the last minute with all
the bookings and everything it
just seemed to be the weekend
that worked out. It is unfortu-
nate that it has to fall in the
middle of the examination per-
iod.

“We suspect that the flies
may be in the library, but we
don’t want .to overlook them
either. That’s why we're having
the’ dance in the Davidsoniana
Room, Friday night.”

Consequently it was only fit-
ting that Brinkley receive this
award.

Brinkley’s latest triumph for
the cause of responsibility was
the statement he recently pre-
sented to the faculty, in which
after observation that the faculty
was not aSked for its opinion
on the trustee by-laws, Brink-
ley astounded the faculty by
declaring that the trustees no
longer had confidence in the
faculty.

Brinkley then recommended
such responsible solutions as

the creation of a Confidence
Committee, the dissolution of
rules for student conduct, and
faculty inaction in naming gov-
ernance committee representa-
tives — a recommendation not
inconsistent with the general
character of that body.

Brinkley, in his characteris-
tically responsible manner sta-
ted, “What the faculty wants
is a system of sharing of power
in which the faculty makes all
the decisions or as Edmund
Burke said ‘The march of the
human mind is slow.’ ”
