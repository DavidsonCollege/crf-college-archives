_ College Glee Club and Sym-
phony Orchestra to Render
Selections

The annual Musical Vesper
service sponsored by the Y. M.
C. A., will be held this Sun-
day, Oct. 31.

The service will be led by Wade
Boggs, Y. M. C. A. secretary. The
musical part of the service will be

and Little Symphony Orchestra,
the former under the direction of
Prof. Thane McDonald and the or-
chestra under Prof. James C. Pfohl.
This will be the first public ap-
pearance of both musical organiza-
tions this year.

To appear with the orchestra will
be a solo violinist of Statesville,
Mr. James Webber. Mr. Webber
is an accomplished violinist, who

has been concert maestro of the

Charlotte Symphony Orchestra and |

has for the past two summers re-

ceived scholarships to the Cincin-

nati Conservatory of Music.

The service will open with the
Prelude by either Professor Pfohl
or Professor McDonald and the
following musical selections will be
given by the Glee Club and Or-
chestra:

Selections by the Glee Club:

Salvation Belongeth to Our
God—Tschesnokovy.

The Lord’s Prayer — Forsyth-
Froft.

It Is the Lord’s Own Day—Foster.
Selections by the Orchestra:

The celebrated Minuet
“First Symphony”—Valensin.

from
Largo —Handel.

The solo by Mr. James. Webber
is to be selected.

C.K. Brown
Ends Talks

Speaking on “Truth,” Dr. C. K:
of the Economics depart-
ment brought to a close on October
24 a series of four talks at the col-
lege Sunday School. Dr. Brown,
whothas led the services during the
month of October, told to a group
of approximately fifty boys the
different ways that people lie.

The speaker opened his lesson by
reminding the group that Christ de-
clared the devil to be the father of
all liars. Lying is one of the great-
est sins of the Christian religion,
However, he said, this does not
mean that we must go out of our
way to be rude and insult a person
in order to be truthful,

There are many ways to lie with-

out speaking, it was pointed out.)

Many of us act a lie, trying to im-
press others or pretending that we
are other than our true selves. At
times we make

statements con-

sciously that have two meanings; /

oftentimes, though we may hope
that they will be taken, the wrong
way, we defend ourselves by say-
ing that we meant a better mean-
ing.

In closing, Dr. Brown gave a. good
exercise for strengthening
character. “Take at least ten min-
utes of every day, or right after
you go to bed at night,” he said,
“and question yourself: ‘Why did
I do such and such a thing today?
Why did I say this or that to some
person'?” He declared that once
we think along these lines we may

stay awake a good deal longer than |

ten minutes, but it

Novels Discussed by Members
Of Society

Sigma Upsilon, the honorary lit-
erary fraternity, started its activi-
ties for the coming year last week
The first meeting was held Wed-
nesday night at the Kappa Sigma
house. Wade Barrow, president of
the society, presided.

The program consisted of a pap-
er by Dr, W.-P. Cumming, of the

}and other material read by mem-

| Roanoke, and John White, the Ar-

same.

A program of activities was out-
lined for the entire first semester.
The program is so designed that
each member will read a paper
sometime during the semester.

One of the main activities to be
undertaken this year will be the
writing of a novel. Prof. C. G.
Davidson will write the first chap-
ter, with different members taking
over the continuation for the sub-
sequent chapters. The writing of
been neglected in late years by the
society and its composition is ex-
pected to bolster greatly the inter-
est of the members in the club as
well the interest of the
members of Sigma Upsilon.
