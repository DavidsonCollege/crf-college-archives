THE DAVIDSONIAN

__OPINIONS

MONDAY, OCTOBER 2, 1995 9

‘In this piece, do you think I
should have some point, some
neatly wrapped and ornamental bit
of fact or reality or truth that I can
hand to you, my fearless reader,
after you have perused these lines?
Or should I flail about in hopes I
might strike a vein somewhere, hit
on a note that takes you back

through time and space anda mind —

full of mingled memories to some-
thing you can almost recall, that
word sitting on the end of your
tongue right now, which cannot
quite get off — and you swallow,
losing it forever? Do I owe you
more? Could I give you more?
Could I give you anything at all?
Maybe.

Anyway, this may or may not
be important, but I like sunsets,
sometimes. That may seem an odd
thing, me liking sunsets sometimes,
and maybe it is. The truth is I was
spoiled: I canremember sitting on
the beach in Maui when I was very
young and watching’ the blazing
sun dip into the deep-blue ocean.
Then, as my guttural six-year-old
mind liked to imagine, the ocean
belched, but not in noise. The
ocean belched in a flash of green.

Much ado about
something

It was fantastic. Since then there.
have been other sunsets that were
almost as wonderful; those sunsets
are the “sometimes.”

It was the Fourth of July, that
most patriotic of holidays, and we
were celebrating. Fireworks had
been purchased by the score. A
large flat stone had been dropped
by providence or the previous own-
ers at the edge of our cliff, and it
threatened to tumble into the Colo-

rado River. We picked this stone °

as our firework launching pad, then
we gathered our friends and rela-
tives into our over sized yard and
feasted. As dusk began to slowly
veil our world with semi-darkness
we turned to watch the sun drop
behind the hills across the river.
Whenevery trace of light was gone,

The Council on Academic Affairs

Not a minor issue

The struggle to add minors to
the academic program at Davidson
faltered at the end of last semester
when it was voted down by the
faculty. Many students are un-
aware of this occurrence and are
concerned that minors have faded
into the background like other un-
dertakings at Davidson. If the de-
bate over minors is to continue, it
must receive campus-wide atten-
tion. Students and faculty need to
open a productive dialogue about
the possibility of minors at
Davidson.

submitted last spring to the Educa-
tional Policies Committee (EPC)

‘by the student-representative
Council on Academic Affairs. The
proposal was later submitted to the
faculty by the EPC with modifica-
tions intended to address some of
the concerns proposed by the fac-
ulty.

Along with this proposal, the
Council on Academic Affairs sent
an open letter to the faculty de-
fending minors and a petition
signed by approximately one-
fourth of the student body who
support the institution of minors.

The proposal asked the fac-
ulty to support the option for indi-

vidual departments to offer. mi-
nors. Departments would then be
able to recognize students who have
participated in stringent programs
outside their majors. Official re-
quirements for minors would con-
Stitute approximately six courses
decided on.by the department of-
fering the minor as well as a mini-
mum GPA requirement no less than
that for a major in the same depart-
ment.

Minors have not been as
widely supported as previously

The proposal for minors was”

to voice significant support for the
proposal beyond the petition last
spring. Students who are inter-
ested should speak with their pro-
fessors about the potential for mi-
nors at Davidson.

This week the Council on
Academic Affairs will distribute a
survey concerning minors to stu-
dents. Please take the time to re-
spond thoughtfully to each ques-
tion. In addition, minors will be
the topic for discussion at an SGA
town meeting on October 26th.
The Council on Academic Affairs
hopes this meeting will act as an
open forum during which students
and faculty may present arguments
for and against minors.

The Davidsonian!

We are grateful for the ac-
complishments of this “quiet re-
solve” and very aware that this
strengthening of our college could
not have been achieved without

the generosity of donors who made
gifts in excess of $158,000,000.
As reported, donors and volun-
teers will be thanked on the evening
‘of. October 5. The next morning at
Fall Convocation, the new profes-
sorships, programs, buildings,
scholarships, and funds they made
possible will be celebrated.

Please come to Convocation!
Truly, the campaign and the con-
vocation have one thing completely
in common: they are both for
Davidson and about Davidson and
would mean little without you.

and our surroundings were masked
from us by our own limitations, the
fireworks show began—I loved it.

Four years ago I was driving
through the mountains in Northern
California with my sister and my
aunt. It was just after Christmas
time. We were spending the holi-
days with my mother’s sister, her
husband, and my four older cous-
ins instead of taking our regular
trek to Texas and my father’s fam-
ily in Austin. I remember a giant
furry finger pointing at me froma
two-dimensional bear body painted
onasign, and the threat/challenge/
warning that only I could prevent
forest fires. And now that I write
this I wonder if it wasn’t the sum-
mer and I wasn’t in South Dakota
with the same aunt, my mother’s

older sister, and the same sister,
my only sibling. I don’t know, but
the place and time are really not
central. What matters is the sunset.

The sun fell softly between two -

jagged peaks and painted them with

shadows of purple, blue, and or-
ange. We stopped to admire dusk’s
iridescence, right in front of
Smokey’s sign.

All the more recently, I gradu-
ated from high school. The bacca-
laureate began at 5:00 and thanks
to our rather long-winded guest
speaker the entire ceremony, gradu-
ation and all, was not completed
until well into the evening. But as
we were gathered, proud gradu-

selves, the sun set. I could see it
well from my vista on the roof,
where my friends and I had been -
shooting off a rather poor collec-
tion of fireworks (another re-oc-
curring theme). Sunsets in the
Midwest have never been dramatic
for me. There are no oceans or
mountains or even hills for the sun
to dip behind, though sometimes
watching the sun drop into a field
can be brilliant. Mostly, however,
they are mundane in comparison
to my belching blue sea. There
was nothing fantastic about this
particular sunset except that it hap-
pened and I was there to see it from
aroof top with my friends, looking
down on a world we were soon to
leave behind.

Sol like sunsets, sometimes. I
do not think it odd. Do you? There
are many things stranger than that,
like the person that climbs a tower
with a rifle and begins indiscrimi-
nately, shooting at people. But
maybe that’s not very strange ei-
ther? I don’t know. Anyway, that
is a question for another time; I
have to go now because I have
many new friends at my door, and
the sun, as it often does, is setting.

My own personal Eton

In moments of tragic nostal-
gia my grandfather would place
me on his lap and recant storiés of
an institution of excellence and
power that he visited while in En-
gland during the second Great War.
This unique institution located
down the road from Windsor Castle
set the standard of excellence in
college preparatory education for
the country’s future statesmen, bar-
risters, poet laureates, and even
mavericks. After all, not only do
you have the Duke of Wellington,

Davidson. I smile when I’m re-
minded by my pop’s story about
the founding of the school for 25
poor indigent scholars in the year
1440.
I’m one of many poor “Oxford
clerics” surrounded by a minute
coterie of noble savages. But not
to worry, these feelings are soon
replaced by the grounding fact that
I am thankful and privileged to be
ina great setting such as Davidson.
My Eton is my educational sanctu-
ary, a place where a member of the

who have passed “the road less
travelled” before me. Those of
you who read this probably think
I’m having delusions of grandeur.
Well, I’m only worried about the
one supreme being who is able to
judge me. I hold close to me the
words of State Secretary Rusk’s
statement in the 1961 edition of
Current Biography, “pray as if it

or any other private in-
stitutions’ admission

tion of birthright or so-

and the symbol of ex-
cellence which I have
found here at Davidson

My grandfather, a man of West
Indian extraction and a fierce lover
of knowledge, wished such for me
to associate myself with such a
place and walk on the shoulders of
the men who ruled over the colo-
nies. I re-acquaint myself with
what I call the “legacy calling”
every time I lay eyes on the facade
of Chambers, saying to myself “I’m
here. Finally, I’m here.”

This feeling only scratches the
surface. I’ ve paid my dues in order
to get my personal piece of Eton,
yet I have acouple of new accesso-
ries which come with my love of

proletariat (such as myself) can
learn from great minds and thus
give me the nurturing and educat-
ing I need in order to combat the
burden of negativity history and
present day propaganda has forced

me to carry. Many Eton graduates

go on to serve in Britain’s highest
and most respected posts and thus
make present attenders of the proud
school. This leads me to think
about Davidson’s most illustrious
graduate, Dean Rusk, and the fact
that he rose from oblivion to one of
the highest positions in this great
nation. So I say to myself: “I’m

there urges me forward. From my
perspective I know I will always
be at odds with the inner sanctums
that run private institutions such as
Eton and Davidson. The members

Kenneth Thompson, may habitu-
ally try to sway public opinion .
Americans of African descent like
myself. However, they can’t take
away the grounded seed which was
planted within me and will lead to
the bountiful growth of a Davidson
