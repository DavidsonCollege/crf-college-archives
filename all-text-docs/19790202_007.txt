Ten Little Indians is full of suspense

By JEAN SORACCO
Asst. Features Editor

Surrounded by darkness,
gunshots and shouts from the
actors, the audience screamed
and grabbed hold of their
neighbors. This was the scene
during one of the most sus-
penseful moments of Ten Little
Indians on Friday night.

Held in the drama workshop,
the play attracted a lot of
audience participation because
of the closeness of the audience
to the stage.

Ann Parker, who played
Emily Brent, commented, ‘It
was interesting to hear the
whispers from the audience as
they debated who the killer
was.”

The play moved very quickly
because of the suspense and the
humor. Jack Hall as William
Blore, alias Mr. Davis, pro-
vided a very humorous note
with his boisterous character
part.

Clifton Fay did a superb job
as the easygoing yet concerned
servant Rogers. James Baskin

Summer is soon to come, and
for those looking for an es-
pecially worthwhile manner in
which to spend those ‘‘free’’
months, Davidson offers a
rather attractive and unique
program that may be of inte-
rest.

The Davidson-Broughton
Summer Program allows under-
graduate students the oppor-
tunity to work in a state mental
hospital. The program runs for
eight weeks, from June 4 to
July 27.

Dr. Timothy N. Webster
directs ‘the program and is
anxious for interested students
to contact him as soon as
possible. Prerequisites for the
program include satisfactory
completion of General Psycho-
logy (Psy 101) and Introduction
to Personality (Psy 102).

In the Davidson-Broughton
Summer Program, students live
on the actual hospital grounds
and are involved with the
diverse units within the hospi-
tal. Each student is assigned to
a different hospital unit for four
weeks, and then is reassigned to
a second unit for the final four
weeks.

Yet, all the while, the stu-
dents have access to. the ma-
jority of the hospital units. One
is allowed, within limits, to
participate in treatment pro-
grams and therapy sessions on
an individual basis.

receive credit for two courses,
Abnormal Psychology (Psy
131) and Advanced Abnormal
Psychology (Psy 231).

The combined tuition for both
courses is only three hundred
dollars, whereas the tuition for
either of these courses during
the academic year at Davidson
is $370.

Important to note is that this
opportunity is not restricted to
psychology majors. Rather,
valuable experience is offered
for all who are considering
clinical-applied occupations
(medicine, nursing, social work,
and others).

Also, a medical hospital

“a mix with diverse and stimu-

‘Hobart’s Park’ exhibits varied success

By JIM GARRETT
Staff Writer

The long-awaited arrival of Davidson’s new campus magazine,
Hobart’s Park, is a pleasant surprise.

Designed to provide an outlet for creative expressions on
campus, Hobart's Park —the brainchild of Lyman Collins, Amanda
Hall, and Greg Hankins—fills its twenty-six pages with genuine
variety.

Reviews, photographs, poetry, essays, art, previews, and
opinions are neatly scattered throughout the issue with a minimum

’ of typographical errors and evidence of careful planning and hard
work.

From Rob Payne’s review of the New Wave's “Devo” to William
Wellnitz’s essay on ‘‘The Near Reality of Human Cloning’’ to
David Webb’s “‘Is the Pope Polish?,’’ Hobart's Park defines itself
in its literary assortment.

Is the assortment in Hobart's Park too varied? Keeping in mind
that Hobart's Park is defined as a ‘“‘magazine’’ and not a literary
journal, the Editor’s emphasis on “‘variety’’ is completely justified
as well as enthusiastically encouraged.

The literary assortment represents the diverse interests on
campus and is unified in such a way that no article, essay, or review
is out of context. There is a glaring absence of short fiction from
students. The Editors attribute this deficiency to “‘space
limitations”’ and ‘‘difficult choices.”’

Since the content of Hobart's Park -is derived from the student
population, it is hoped that aspiring writers will come forward to
submit their stories to Hobart's Park’s next issue.

The photography, poetry, and art contribute significantly to the
‘‘magazine”’ quality that the Editors felt was important. Beyond
adding ‘‘variety” to the magazine, the photography, poetry, and
art demonstrate, in themselves, genuine inspiration and talent.

Gary Hart's ‘red sox on the.radio”’ and Whit Yelverton’s photo
essay on darkness are exemplary of the artistic quality throughout
the issue.

Davidsonians like Albee’s plays;
Albee’s actors like Davidsonians

By MARY WILLIS

Staff Correspondent
Edward Albee proved once
more that as a playwright, his
work can and will shock audi-
ences. into thought. and. aware-
ness. Monday night, his com-
pany performed The American

Dream and Zoo Story, two one:

act plays, in Love Auditorium.
They contained both comic and’

tragic elements.
The company was put to-

gether and directed by Albee
himself, who ‘almost choreo-
graphed the pieces,”’ as one of
the actors put it. This produc-
tion, formulated and formalized
by Albee himself, represents the
author’s conception precisely,
and, as a unified whole, fas-
cinatingly.

Themes ran together from the
two plays; they dealt with role
playing, pride, honor—all of
these as false ideals—and
showed them to us in jest, and
in earnest. They were ‘‘dep-
ressing,’’ sad, hilarious re-

presentations—they were ridi-
culous and very real.

They pulled from every appa-
rent emotional outlet in the
audience and found some that
were hidden, perhaps because of
the derivation from Albee’s own
experience. He presents what he
knows.

The response from the audi-
ence was excellent throughout
the performance and after-
wards, as the students met with
the actors at the reception in the
Union.

The actors readily praised the
Davidson audience and com-
munity as one of the better ones
they had confronted. One of the
actors discussed the importance
of audience feedback and re-
sponse, and praised Monday's
crowd as being “sharp”.

Albee's productions enter-
tained, but mostly they must
have succeeded in making us
look at ourselves, for a moment
at least.
