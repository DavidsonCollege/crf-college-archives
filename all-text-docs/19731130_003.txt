nice picture book,’’ he said,
“but it doesn’t really reflect
life at Davidson.

“Editor Ron Conoley did the
entire book, and there was
poor communication between
him and his photographers,”’

Hardgrove explained

‘We can't get enough in-
terest or motivation from the
student body to do a good job.
Ron was just left to meet the
blunt of the consequences,’’ he
said. ‘Maybe we only have
enough interest to put out a
mediocre book.”

This year’s Quips and
Cranks Editor, Jeff George,
claims that he can avoid the
pitfalls which produced the

disappointing annual.
“The latest fails
the same way the 1972 one did;

it has no copy, it’s just a weird
collection of pictures,” he
said. ‘‘It’s probably the worst
annual I've seen at Davidson.

“There was a movement
toward annuals with no copy,
just interrelated pictures con-
veying a single theme, but this
annual did not havea theme.”

George also indicated that
the yearbook was almost com-
pletely the work of Editor
Conoley. ‘‘He ended up doing
it all himself because that’s
what he wanted to do,”’
George said. ‘‘Ron might have
become a little lax."

explained that this
yous tan Santat was changed
completely. ‘“‘We will have
everything tie in with a cen-
tral theme, and we will cover
those things which a majority
of the people are interested
in.”’
Copy will also be used in this
year’s book in addition to the
photographs

George is pleased with the
annual’s progress thus far. If
he can keep his current
schedule, the yearbook should
be ready for distribution in
May.

At the latest the books will
be ready by the beginning of
the fall term.

‘Union Events Stall Winter Doldrums

By CHARLES KENNON
Staff Writer

“The three weeks before
Christmas are great, with
something happening every
day,” said Union President
Joe Earle. ‘‘And the pace un-
til the end of the term isn’t
much lighter.’’ Union plans
for the term are being
finalized, with plays, concerts,
speakers and movies on the
schedule

Next week will be one of the
busiest this year as far as the

Union is concerned. On
Tuesday, the National

ly of New
York will the

i comedy
“As You Like It’’. Tickets will
be $2 for outsiders and $1 for
students, faculty and staff.

The year-long Artist Series
will sponsor another play, on

Dec. 7, “Las Cantigas de San-
ta Maria.” Performed in the
style of an actual 13th-century
play, it will relate in song (the
“cantigas’’) the major
miracles of Mary.

The New York Times called
it “A performance that can
only be described as perfect.”
Assistant Director of the
Union Duff Bruce felt that this
was one of the most significant
dramas brought to Davidson
in recent years.

On Dec. 8 Harry Chapin will
perform in concert in Love
Auditorium. There will be no
admission charge.

The Comedy Symposium
will have three Marx Brothers
films Dec. 10-11. They will be
“‘Coconuts,”’ ‘‘Horsefeathers”
and ‘‘A Day at the Races.”

James Hamilton ‘60 will
speak in Phi Hall on Dec. 11.

Fellows Seek New Applicants

Although you have been at
Davidson for only a few mon-

ths, you are about to make an
important decision that could
affect many facets of your
college career. You have been
sent application materials
from the North Carolina
Fellows Program (NCFP)
and you must decide now
whether you intend to apply.
New members are accepted
ONLY as freshmen; thus,
NOW is your first and last op-
portunity. You have read the
introductory material mailed

anyway? The brochure states,
“The North Carolina Fellows
Program seeks to identify
young persons with ex-
ceptional leadership potential

them in the development of

mittee has approved the
DAVIDSONIAN request
that all future editors of
the newspaper receive
$100 per term for their
work. At the reaps,
of each term, the editor
will receive his check
which may be spent in
any way he or she sees
fit.

Translated into action, this
means contact with other
students (and faculty) of high
leadership quality here at
Davidson through bi-monthly
luncheons (business meetings,
social gathering, exchange of
ideas).

An internship as viewed by
the Fellows Program is a

indepth work of a high level

of the partisan conflicts that
the committee is hampered

by.

“Hamilton should be a very
interesting speaker. He will
show the students a legal field
that up until now has been
somewhat obscure,’ said
Bruce.

“‘Like a number of the
events for this term he isn’t on
the Union calendar of events.
Students should watch for our
posters and announcements,”
he added.

Another speaker on an
unusual subject is George
Fawsett. Scheduled for Dec.
19, he will talk about U.F.O.s.
For years he has been in-

students.

signed for those dates
although several are
consideration.

Buckminster Fuller,
described as ‘‘the last of the
Renaissance men’’ will speak
at Davidson Feb. 4 and 5. The
Union is trying to get a co-
speaker for the occasion.

The Union has joined the
Video Tape Network. It is in
the process of buying some
playback equipment and tape
programs.

Bruce hopes to have some
film to show prior to Fuller's
arrival. ‘‘We plan to establish
viewing areas in the bar and
other convenient locations,”
Bruce explained.

Several events are ten-
tatively scheduled for the late
winter or early spring. Dick
Gregory, noted black
comedian and politician, will
speak, but the exact date has
yet to be set.

‘We hope that this series of
events will take the edge off
the boredom of the winter
term,’’ Bruce stated.

Earle added, ‘‘We feel we
have given students a true
_ alternative to studying. ”
