FRIDAY, MARCH 12, 1954

With the bright
springtime sun beam-
ing down and many a
young Davidson man's
fancy turning to the
things of love (and
spring sports), we feel
, it necessary to pull

away entirely from this
season of the year to
bring to light some
. interesting comments
heard around the cam-

sonian in recent weeks

By JOHN HANDLEY

tees’ action with reference to the underwriting of the $35,000
for athletics here at Davidson.

In a way we can hardly help but laugh at some of the
juvenile and unthinking comments which have come to our
attention and in some cases these derogatory remarks seem
to be along the line of the average Davidson cynical treatment
of “griping just for the sake of griping.” However, in many
instances we feel that the individual feelings of some are sin-
cere and genuinely concerned about the so-called dangers in-
volved in this subsidizing by the college.

Wildcat Program Smoall.in Comparison

In point of actual fact the $30,000 proposed for football
aid involves no sizeable increase over the amount spent on
the gridiron in the past few years. In basketball it amounts
to a little something from almost nothing. Although $35,000
sounds like a tremendous amount to spend on athletics in two
sports, if a careful observer would examine the situation he
would find that this amount is just a drop in the bucket com-
pared to many of the schools against which the Wildcats are
competing. However, we do not mean to propose this as an
argument in favor of the recent Trustee action as we have
never found much worth in the “everybody’s doing it” state-
ment.

We should like to quote directly here a part of the
Trustee statement in regard to this decision which was printed
in the Davidsonian several weeks ago. It reads as follows: “If
Davidson is to be a force for good in the world of inter-
collegiate athletics, it must lead from a position of strength
rather than from weakness. We believe that under our
present able coaching staff real progress will be made during
the next few years without lowering of academic or moral
standards unless the necessary support of athletics is with-
held.”

Trustee Statement Could Be Twisted

This statement could, of course, be twisted to infer the
birth of a power-crazed spirit rearing its ugly head among the
leading spirits of the alumni organization and driving the
helpless and innocent defenses against professional college
football. at Davidson before it until the Davidson line would
average 230 pounds per man of 50 IQ coal miners and the
backfield men would spend their time reading comic books
and driving their new model Cadillacs over the country side. It
could be interpreted as a hint at a $100,000 football program
and a group of 7-foot giants ranging the basketball courts.
However, we very seriously doubt it and consider it absurd
to think such a thing.

The two teams which round out

Courts Bad

Poor condition of the local

early workouts, but they are
rounding into better condition
now. The team has worked out
every day this week and will con-
tinue to do so through Wednesday.

Hampered by a broken little

Varsity Cindermen
To Meet Mercer
In Track Opener

By ANDY TURNER

Coach Pete Whittle recently an-
nounced a seven-meet track sched-
ule opening with Mercer Univer-
sity at Macon, Georgia, on April
10 and closing with the Southern
Conference meet at VPI in Blacks-
burg, Va., on May 15. ;

The schedule includes only two
home meets, one against Clemson
and Wofford in a triangular affair
on April 17 and the other against
Furman on April 28. The Cats will
meet South Carolina, The Citadel,
W&L, and State on the road.

Last year the thinclads boasted

We have come into contact with many of the alumni of], ¢3 record, losing only to USC
the college and various other friends of Davidson, and of|(twice) and to Clemson by one

course, the coaching staff, and nowhere have we found any
intimation of-such a feeling among the alumni and especially
not among the coaches. It seems undeniable that the situation
which has prevailed on the gridiron and on the hardwood has
been deplorable and certainly
building and sportsmanship which actually is the purpose for
intercollegiate athletics.

Wildcat Club Won’t Fold After Action

Another comment we have heard voiced in several places
is the idea that the Wildcat club will cease to raise the amount
it has in the past and put the entire burden on the college. The
Wildcat Club is already in the hands of the administration and
it has not met a quota yet, some are quick to point out, so why
could we expect any increase in the subscriptions to raise
the money. It is our opinion that if the college money-raisers
knew that the college must make up the $35,000 even if the

Davidson’s Wildcat baseballers open their season next Thursday afternoon when they
hit the Fort Jackson nine on the army diamond. The Jackson contest opens the annual
spring trip which includes five games this season, with games against Parris Island Marines
on Friday and Saturday, Georgia Teachers on Monday, and Florida State on Tuesday.

Red-Black Contest
Ends Spring Practice

Last Saturday afternoon saw the
Wildcat gridders conclude their
spring practice sessions with the
annual Red-Black football game
which ended in a 12-12 tie. Ap-
proximately 700 fans watched the
defensive battle. It was a battle of
lines a lot of the way with some
fine offensive play turned in by
-both teams. °

Henry Brown showed some in-
dication of things to come next
fall as he sparked several Black
drives in a fine performance. Bill
Rowland did a fine job under the
center for the Blacks as he made
some fine pass plays and called
a generally good game.

All in all it was a well played
game and Coach Dole expressed
his approval of the spring’s re-
sults and showed great enthusiasm
for next fall.

Johnston, Fargason, Lawing,
Reid, Newton, Campbell, and
Brewer missed the game either
because of injury or sickness.

BETAS WIN FRAT TRACK

Taking six first places, the Betas
won the interfraternity track meet
last Wednesday and Thursday on
Richardson Field. Bill Gramley won
two first places, Archie Joyner won
two, Roswell Mallory took one, and
Zack Kilpatrick also took one. °

Bill Gramley, a Beta frosh,
set a new interfraternity record in
the shot put. He putted the shot
49 {t. 6 in. in the opening event of
the meet. He also won the discus
throw event.

Joyner took wins in the 3-quar-
ters run and the 660-yd run. Kil-
patrick won the hurdles event, and
Mallory took first place in the
440-yd. run.

Henry Brown of the SAEs was
the highest scoring man in the
meet. Brown won the 100-yd dash,
the broad jump, and the 220-yd.
dash as he racked up a total of
15 points.

Don Stewart was second in point
totals. The Phi Delt runner picked
up 10.5 points, and it was largely
through his efforts that the Phi
Delts were able to edge the SAEs
in a battle for second place.

Robinson won ‘the high jump
event in the only event that one
of the top three teams did not win.

Shown below are the final stand-
ings of the teams participating in
the finals. The point totals are

THREE SPORTS LEFT
ON FRAT AGENDA

With only three sports remain-
ing on the fraternity schedule,
Coach Pete Whittle announced yes-
terday that two of these, volley-
ball and tennis, will get under
way immediately after the return
from spring vacation. Softball will
begin immediately after the com-
pletion of these two sports.

The KAs stand. as defending
champs in volleyball, while the
Phi Delts are favored to repeat
their title on the strength of their
stellar performer, Buford Price,
beaten only once in last year’s
competition. The Phi Gams and
KAs were co-champs in softball
Jast year. —

The Cats who failed to win a
game last season, should show a
lot of improvement during the
course of this season. The sched-
ule includes about 20 games, but is
not complete at the moment.

Much of the Wildcat success
this year will depend on the pitch-
ing staff which is studded with
regulars returning from last sea-
son. The top pitchers on the staff,
judging from past records will be
Ish Bennett, Johnny Smith, Andy
Courts, and Roger Little. These
four will get some able assistance
from such returning hurlers as
Cliff Deal, Lindley Beardsley and
Diehl Sluss.

The infield will be led by second
baseman and captain Johnny Gray
who is playing his fourth season
with the Cats. Alternate captain
Fred Stowe is the power hitter of
the club and will probably roam
the outfield from his regular left-
field position.

The remainder of the flashy in-
field combination besides Capt.
Gray will be Billy Morris at third,
Buzzy Hope at short, with the big
question mark being around the
initial sack.

Bill Rowland will add some
much-needed power to the batting
order and should be a big help in
the outfield. Shorty Sfaelos and
Bill Gtidewell. will handle most of
the catching, both are returning
lettermen. A few of the other re-
turning men who will see action
are such prospects as Max Devane,
Herschel Allen, Hugh Stevens and
Jimmy Kiser.

The team has been working hard
and .Coach Clements has expressed
his enthusiasm over the prospects
for the season. Coach Clements has
also been working with the fresh-
men. who have had a good turn-
out for the Wildkitten squad. Yes-
terday the two teams held an in-
trasquad game as both began to
work out the rough spots.

ATTENTION !

Athietic director Paul Scott
announced todey that the
Carolinas AAU Handball tour-
ney will be held st Davidson
on April 2 and 3. The tourne-
ment is open to any Davidson
student who wishes to enter
and anyone interested should
contact Mr. Scott before leav-
ing the campus for the veca-
tion.

Naval Base, Washington Naval Re-
ceiving Station, Cherry Point Ma-
rines, Norfolk Boys Sports Club,

Frosh Tracksters
To Open April 9

Since the completion of football
drills and the arrival of warm
weather, the freshman track team
has begun to get into shape for
the coming season and first meet
with Myers Park High School on
April 9. Coach Whittle has sched-
uled six meets for the team, four
of which are here at Davidson.

With little over a week's time to
round into form, the freshmen are
already displaying a number of
talented performers in both the
track and field events. Pete Ash-
craft, who ran the mile in the
winter track season, will be a
strong contender on the cinders,
while Bill. Gramley takes a high
rating in the discus and shot put.

Mal McSwain rates as one of the
