Vol. VI.

Juniors to Reveal

Their Knowledge

War and Outlook of the Future are
Main Topics.

The third year men have at last de-
cided on the subjects upon which they
will display their oratorical ability week
after next. The topics, as can be seen
from the following list. deal promiscu-
ously with most of the weight matters
of the world. “Phe war and military
questions seem to monopolize the interest
of the orators; the economic, educational
and abstract subjects have not been neg-
lected by any means, The inhabitants
of Davidson and the fair visitors will
hear expounded such momentous ques-
tions as “Have a Heart." “My ‘Fwenty
Years at Davidson.” “The Great ‘Tri-
umvirate,” “Materialism vs, Spiritual-
ism.” “The Almighty Dollar.” “Launch
Out Into the Deep.” “How. | Won the

War in the S. A. ‘I. C.." "Essentials of
Happy Marriage.” aad. as usual,
“Woman Suffrage." If the speeches

sound as profound as the titles, the Ju-
niors will do themselves proud. ‘The

Three Games of Trip

Much Improvement, However,
Shown By Team.’

In each of the first three games of the
Virginia invasion the Davidson quint
met defeat, the with marked signs ot
improvement in each successive contest.
Davidson's lack ot weight and experi-
ence were in evidence, tho the team put
up a game fight in each game. With
McAskill as ‘the lone letter man back.
the team selected from the class aggre
gations has made as good a showing as
could well be expected,

POM. Game. Feb. 13.

Last Thursday night in Lexington the
faster and more experienced V. ML. 1.
quint outclassed the Wildcats in a one-
sided game to the tune of 61 to 10. The
Cadets staged a system ot passing and
teamwork that baffled the Davidson
hoys completely. The playing of the
home team was the most finished yet seen
during the season in) Lexington. “The
visiting quint failed te do itself justice,
as the score plainly points out, tho it
scrapped. gamely thruout the game. Mc-
Askill starred for Davidson, while Wills
and Sullivan put up a splendid game
for the Cadets. The V. M. 1. Scrubs
were run in the second half. ‘Phe line-up:

Wo and L. Game, Feb. vg

Vhe game with the Generals’ was
much better than the previous one with
Vv. M. The score 28-6 in favor of
Washington and Lee does not give a cor-
rect indication of the strength of the two
teams. The Wildcats were rested and
played a stronger game. The contest
was fast. hard fought and free from per-
conal fouls. The score forthe. first half
was 24-5, with Hines and McCain star-
ring for the Generals. Harrington's
knees gave him trouble in this lialf, and
Brice took his place in the second.

In the second half for nineteen min-
utes neither side scored a field goal.
which showed that our team came back
with a real fight. Chalmers, Schenck
and Davenport were the leaders for Da-
vidson. Summary:

DAVIDSON COLLEGE. DAVIDSON, N. C., FEBRUARY 19, 1919.
Wildcats Drop First

Lieut.-Colonel Meuller
Assigned to Davidson

Expected to Arrive Soon. Govern-
ment Requests Measurements.

Government authorities have intorm-
ed Dr. Martin that Lieut. Col. A. HL.
Meuller. of Camp Beauregard. has been
transterred to the Davidson R. O. ‘VT.
C. ‘“Vhe Government also asked that
the measurements for uniforms be sent
in,

Lieutenant: Meuller has already lett
Camp Beauregard and is on his wets
here naw, by way ot New Orleans, and
should arrive in a few days.

The fellows whe: said there would be
no RL QO. CP. Co are agreeably disap-
pointed ; however, it will go hard on the
men who were looking forward to the
R. On CT. Co as a “crip.” ter soon the
familiar sounds of “squads — right.
“squads left.” ete. and even Bitzer’s

bugle may be heard on the campus, But.
“the worst is vet to come.”

1 Rifles will
have to be cleahed up for inspection as
before, but they will he U.S. rifles, and
perhaps we will not get “stuck” as often

as in the 8, A TLC.

CURRIE AND WHITE
WIN DECLAIMER'’S MEDALS
“Pow! But beam glad that it is
er” This and other expressions ol

relief of like mature arose fram the six

contestants in the Freshman-Sophomore

Declamation contest held in’ Shearer

Hall last Monday night. this being the

occasion of the literary struggle at which

the honors were to be awarded as to who
was the best declaimer in cach of the
two literary societies,

The contest was one of the best uf
this nature that has been held at David-
son in a number of years, and although
the audience was small, this did not pre
vent the speakers from giving their best.
All the contestants came well prepared
and cach acquitted himself with honor.
Each selection was well handled. being
attractively given with plenty of life and
action. “Phere were plenty of thrilis.
but this applied to the speakers for the
most part.

The Philanthropic Society was repr*
cented by C. G. Long, “The Unknown
Speaker ;" D. W. Lowrance, “Lest We
Forget :" and A. L.. Currie, “The Death
of Lafavette.” all of whom displayed
marked ability and were a credit to their
society.

Those entering from the Fumenean
Society were: W. P. Cummings, ‘Th:
Spirit of America:?’ A. M. Miitchei!.
“The March of the Flag; and H.
White. “Hamlet's Soliloquy on Death.”
These men rendered their selections in
an easy and attractive manner, showing
that in time they will develop into ex-
cellent speakers.

After a short deliberation bv the
judges, whose opinion was that the con-
test was remarkably close, the decisien
was returned that the winners were H.
White, Eumenean, and A. L. Currie
Philanthropic.

B. D. Heath, Jr., spent several days
on the Hill last week on his way to New

York.

No. 16

Dr. C. F. Myers
Arrives. Monday

Accompanied By His Quartet. Good

Results Are Expected.

Plans have been completed for the
evangelistic meetings to be held next
Monday, ‘Tuesday and Wednesday
nights, to be conducted by Dr. C.F.
Myers, pastor ot the First Church vof
Greenshoro. Dr, Myers will be accom-
panied by Mrs. Mivers, and. also by his
quartet composed of two ladies and two
gentlemen. “Phe plan at present. is to
have a meeting about an hour in length
on each of the three evenings. ‘he music
will be excellent: and singing by the
boys will be emphasized. “Mall prayer
meetings every evening will be observed
tor the rest of this week, so that the serv-
ices may prove most effective. ‘Phe pro-
into
operation, so that every man on the Hill
will be approached ‘and the whole stu-
dent body be present at the meetings.

Dr. Myers is an ideal voung man’s
preacher. Members of the student body
who heard him on his two previous visits
to the campus were deeply impressed by
his talks, and there will be no doubt
that they will be present at the services
next week, And it will he safe to say
that any other man who attends the first
meeting will not miss the other two.
Dr. Miers’ attractive cheerfulness niakes
him well liked by all young people, and
his pep and earnestness win them every
time.

MARSHALS V¢ YPE TO
WEAR REGALIAS

cieties marshals were clected for the
year. “Vhose elected from the Fu. Se-
ciety were: Emery Flinn, chief; B.A.

viety: TLC. Stone, b.. BL McKeithen, O.
Po Hart and D. W. Roberts.

At a joint meeting of the two societies
it was decided that the marshals should
wear the regular regalia as of former

rose-bud imitation such as the marshals
of last year had to wear.
