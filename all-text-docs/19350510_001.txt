Dr. Ruark Lectures Here

Carolina Physics Professor
Speaks On “Building Stones
Of Matter”

Dr. Arthur E. Ruark, head of the
fPhysics department at the University
of North Carolina, spoke to an audience
of about 200 students last Monday
night in Chambers Auditorium on the
subject: “Building Stones of Matter.”

His lecture which began shortly after,
dealt principally with the muclear side
of matter—protons, electrons, positrons,
photons, deutrons, and neutrons. It
embodied a scholarly treatment of the
principles of underlying the cosmic ray,
the alpha ray and the beta ray.

Dr. Ruark’s lecture was made clearer
by the use of slides projected upon the
back wall of the stage. These dem-
onstrated by photograph, drawing, and
design, the finer points of his lecture.

He began by dealing with Hydrogen,

the simplest of atoms, and proceeding
to take up the more complex ones step
by step. He showed diagrams of sev-
eral experiments that have been per-
formed recently, dealing with the char-
ges of atoms etc. He also pointed out
the presence of alpha, beta, and gamma
rays. The story of their discovery and
their widespread existence.
Several slides were shown depicting
apparatus used to produce large elec-
trical charges for the purpose of study-
ing the behavior of such rays.

The action of certain rays in dif-
ferent gases and also in unusual ele-
ments was shown.

He concluded by telling of the ex-
periments of several leaders in this
field and the possibilities for future
development along these lines of nu-
clear chemistry.

This lecture, under the auspices of
the Faculty Committee on Public Lec-
tures and sponsored by theg Physics
and Chemistry departments, was pre-
viously scheduled for early March, but
was postponed.

Although this is Dr. Ruark’s first
year at the university, he is the head
of the Physics department there and
has long been prominent in scientific
fields, being in great demand as a
lecturer on scientific subjects.

Before his connection with the Uni-
versity of North Carolina, he was a
research worker in the Mellon Institute
of Industrial Research and lectured on
Physics at the University of Pittsburgh.

by the Converse chapter and the Dav-

Wood, Jacqueline — Archie Coleman,
Lucine—J. F. Simpson, Leandre—Bob
Coit, Thibault—W. F. Pierce, Porrin

The plot of the comedy is laid around
Lucinde’s playing mute in order not to
be forced by her father, Geronte to
marry someone other than her true
lover, Leadre, Sganarelle, a woodcutter,
is tricked by his wife into posing as a
famous doctor. Through his efforts
the lovers are finally united.

Robert, a meddlesome neighbor;
Lucas, a simpleton, and his wife, Jac-
queline; the prompous Geronte; scoun-
drel Sganafelle; and a great deal of
back-beating add comedy to the play.
Valere, a servent; Thibault, a peasant;
and his son, Porrin, play more or less
important parts.
