Summer Movie Medley

From Waterworld to Batman to Dumbo

By THE DAVIDSONIAN STAFF

As the summer ends, it is only
appropriate that we reflect back
and find a way to characterize the
last three months of our lives.
Summer movies, more than any
other set of events, establish the
tone and personality of summer-

time. I can remember back to the .

T2 summer (liquid metal graphics
— way cool!), more recently the
Jurassic Park summer (realistic
dinosaurs — neat-o), and then the
Gump summer (“Run, Forrest!
Run!” Need I say more?).

And now it seems we must
characterize summer ‘95. It had its
usual line up of “blockbuster sure
winners” such as Batman Forever,
Waterworld, and Mortal Kombat,
which were more spectacles than
movies in most cases. The most
interesting thing about this sum-
mer was that people seem to be
turning away from the “block-
buster” line-up in search of movies
where the actors are more than just
vehicles for the latest technical
wonders of the silver screen.Apollo
13, Smoke, and even Clueless are
films that drew a larger audience
simply because the movies are
about people rather than trumped
up special effects.

Batman Forever was an un-
fortunate disappointment. After
all of its publicity, it failed to have
the class or style of the first two
Tim Burton directed films. It was
a collage of overly spectacular ex-
plosions, dizzy high speed camera

Batman Forever was just one of this summer’s disappointments.

work, and silly, pat one liners. The
only redeemable aspect of the
movie was Jim Carry’s humorous
caricature of the Riddler. The
movie as a whole does not stick
together from scene to scene and
lacks the unique and memorable
characterization of the previous
Batman films. ;
Waterworld, the most expen-
sive movie ever produced, had its
triumph in the fact that it did not
look excessive. The catamaran
action scenes were original and
exciting, but the sets and scenery
did not overshadow the actors:
Jeanne Tripplehorn was lovely,

Dennis Hopper his usual deranged
self, and Kevin Costner surpris-
ingly subtle. There were a few
problems, though. The film made
no effort to explain how the float-
ing communities were built, how
an old man commandeered a
refuse-blimp successfully, or how
a huge supply of dry cigarettes
became available to the landless.
To top it all off, Costner had gills
— little baby ones behind his ears.
If that doesn’t make you shiver,
you probably liked Calender Girl.

Smoke is the jewel in the rough
this summer. Strong performances
by the entire cast, which includes

veterans Harvey Keitel, William
Hurt, Stockard Channing, and
Forrest Whitaker, make this a must

_ see. An intricate weaving of ulti-

mately interconnected lives,Smoke
follows several plot lines but comes
together fantastically by the end,
showing the audience that we all
are responsible for each other.
“Optimistic” and “happy” are not
two words generally used to de-
scribe an “artsy” film— which it is
— but they fit it well. Smoke does
have a rough edge which might
keep some viewers at bay. It is a
tale of redemption and reunion,
compassion and concern so art-
fully done that one leaves the the-
ater moved and content but doesn’t
quite know why.

Apollo 13 was another one of
this summer’s successful hits. It
exemplified the classic, all Ameri-
can journey into uncharted terri-
tory. In this case, the heroes are
astronauts instead of settlers and
the obstacle is space instead of the
Wild West. Apollo 13 is beauti-
fully directed by Ron Howard to
give the audience an overwhelm-
ing impression of the vastness of
space and the fragility of man. All
the acting was well executed with
Tom Hanks still dazzling in his all
American stardom. It is definitely
not a movie to miss. -

Clueless’ s intensity and depth
can be summed up in the major
insult of the movie: “You're a vir-
gin who can’t drive.” The film is
not exactly one to stretch the intel-
lect, but one which reflects (albeit

in a distorted view) the shallow-
ness, stupidity and constant trauma
of age 15. Clueless is predictable
and unrealistic, but so darn cute it
is worth seeing.

Who would have thought to
bring together Dennis Leary, Doug
E. Doug, Danny Glover, and Ray
Liotta in an attempt at heart-warm-
ing adventure? And to title it Op-
eration Dumbo Drop? While
Disney holds my utmost respect
for their animated features, even
they should ask themselves if the
concepts of children’s entertain-
ment, Dennis Leary’s acting, and
tugging at the ole’ heart-strings

Teally go together. If you’ve pre-

dicted so, get ready for a big sur-
prise.

Mortal Kombat attempts to
thrill the late-summer crowd with
high end special effects, fast paced
fighting scenes, and spelling ev-
erything with “K’s.” While this
film sports no Kevin Kosner, nora
Kaped Krusader, it Kontains Ku-
dos of Kicks for Kiddies, and pos-
sibly forthose Krazy Kollege Kids.
No discernible plot here, but a
movie based ona video game prob-
ably doesn’ treally need it anyway.
If you Krave the action of Enter the
Dragon but wish to avoid the deep
emotional Kommitment of Street
Fighter, then perhaps this is the
film for you. Froma Kritical stand-
point, it’s right up there with Op-
eration Dumbo Drop, but if you
are bored enough, then Mortal
Kombat may add some Kraziness
to your Kruise to the movies.

more bitten with mosquitoes, and
our appearance more ragged. We
never really knew how bad we
looked because we didn’t have
mirrors. I'll never know if the

people on the buses stared at us
because of our wild hair and torn
clothes or because of our light-
colored skin,

Although there is a push to-
wards modernization in India, life

changes very slowly. One of the
most striking mental images I have
is of the many couples on mopeds,
with the woman’s traditional sari
flying in the wind.

Gandhi once said that the heart

of India lies in its villages. Beyond
the poverty and need, there is an
innate beauty to the ancient village
