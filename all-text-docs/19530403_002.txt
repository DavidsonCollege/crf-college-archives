Opportunity Of Seltlessness
Presented To Davidson Again

Thursday and Friday of next week the Davidson Student
Body will have its second opportunity this year to donate
blood. The outstanding record of nearly 500 pints contributed
by the college and community last December showed what
this writer believes to exemplify the real Davidson spirit. The
need for blood was recognized and that need was fulfilled. The
Christian ideal of doing something beneficial for others was
put into practice resulting in the most successful blood drive
thus far completed. But we certainly do not expect to rest
on our laurels.

The need is still very real. During the past two weeks two
Davidson men have been killed in the service of their coun-
try bringing the total to seven during the Korean conflict.
Several others have been wounded. Many of us knew these
men personally. For each of us to give a pint of blood seems
the very least we can do.

Blood is also needed to fight polio which reaches out every
year to claim thousands of victims. At last a new drug is being
developed for protection against this dread disease. The vac-
cine is known as gamma globulin. Stock piles are being built,
but the anticipated need for blood is far from being filled.

Although the blood drive is an old thing to most of us
as drive chairman Dagenhart pointed out, we connot afford
to become complacent. If this drive is to be ‘a success, it will
depend on the student body getting squarely behind it..

This traditie of recent origin, the selflessness exhibite
by the student body in giving their blood to so worthy a cause,
is being put to the test again. Will you continue to do your
part?

Sunrise Easter Service Sunday

On Sunday morning at 6:30 a voluntary service of wor-
ship consisting mostly of Scripture and. prayer will be he!d
on the golf course. This is primarily a time for withdrawing
and in the calm and freshness of an early dawn remember
what Easter signifies, what God did for man in Christ. The
worship is being planned and presented by members of the
student body under the direction of the Y.M.C.A. and is open
to all who are willing to interrupt a morning’s rest and join
with one another to commemorate this stupendous event in
history. Mary Magdalene found a risen Lord that first Easter
‘morn, but she had first to experience an empty tomb. Christ
comes to those who earnestly seek Him.—C.W.

Faculty-Student Committee Report:

Plans Laid By Committee For
Better Co-ordination ot Events

The Faculty-Student Committee met Tuesday afternoon, March
31 in the College Union for its second regularly scheduled meeting.
The main topic of discussion Was the co-ordination of college activities
so as to cut down the number of conflicts of events throughout the
school year. Many conflicts have arisen this year in sports activities,
artist and concert series, dance week-ends, fraternity functions, and
review period schedules.

Meeting with this committee on this matter were Dr. Spencer, Mr.
Scott, Col. Davis, and Lawrence Erwin. An explanation of schedule
policy was presented by various departments of the college.

Dr. Spencer stated that a log was kept in his office to list all
activities through the school year and should be consulted before dates
are chosen for events. He pointed out that with anly 180 school days
conflicts of one kind or another are bound to arise with all the college
activities. But, this log should be used by all organizations to keep
conflicts ai a minimum.

Mr. Scott, explaining the situation in the athletic departinent,
said that all sports schedules must be arranged far in advance. It is
definite that there will be football games every week-end from the
third week in September until the third week in November. Basketball
schedules are arranged for the following season at the Southern Con-
ference meeting at Raleigh every March. Thus a twenty game season
will have to include Friday and Saturday night games, some of which
fall on dance week-ends. This points out the problem of fitting the
sports program into the college calendar, for games must be arranged
to fit in other college schedules as well as Davidson's schedule.

Col. Davis said that the ROTC Department was primarily concerned

with the blood drives and the rifle matches. Although blood drive
dates are selected several months in advance for a week when the cal-
endar is apparently light, the week is filled by the time the blood
drive arrives. The rifle team schedule is made up in September and
October for matches from November through March. When four or five
schools participate, it is difficult to set a date that will suit all con-
cerned.
Mr. Plott, chairman of the artist series committee, reported that
the series must be arranged in the Spring for the following year. The
set review periods are adhered to as far as possible, but sometimes
an artist can only appear on a certain night due to a planned tour. The
Male Chorus trips are also scheduled to try to prevent conflicts with
reviews and other activities.

The review period schedule was discussed at some length, emumer-
ating the problems it caused in trying to schedule events during the
school year. A recommendation will be made concerning the review
periods at the Faculty meeting either in April or May.

Dr. Beaty suggested thst the fraternities keep a central booking
system for the years activities to provide for better co-ordination of
events. Dates of rush week were discussed with recommendations to
the LF.C.

Next year in order to prevent conflicts, representatives of the

Sees A Need For Realism

In Candidates’ Promises

@

“And furthermore I promise we
will have free beer in every room
and women for all...” We yawn-
ed. People all around us were
yawning. It was in the senior sec-
tion at chapel. The time of year?
Spring and with it the inevitable
elections.

Inevitable. Is that a proper term
to use when describing the most
cherished institution of democracy?
It isn't for all elections, but does
not come far from missing the
mark in speaking of Davidson elec-
tions.

We could imagine less ex-
perienced faces light up with
glee as the speaker droned
on with his absurd promises.
it wasn’t hard. We had done it
ourself on past occasions. Yeah,
unlimited cuts. Tell those trus-
tees what to do. Grer.

It’s a frightening fact, but none-
theless a true one that wild pro-
mises like many of those we heard
during the recent race for student
body president are wishful think-
ing. Better almost to have voted
for the man who promised least,
for that is in a way an indication
of his realizing the reality of the
situation.

is straining its innards to make
financial ends meet end is
forced to put three men in el-
most every room, how could

Winter Ends; Spring’s Sprung;
Reviews Have Again Begun

By RONALD WILSON

Well, it’s Here. After dragging
itself through many months of
rain, wind, and bitter chill, Spring
has finally staggered in through
the back door hefe at the convent.
Now one can see green splotches
hither and thither upon the great
brown desert stretching between
the dorms and Chambers, and in
some places the red mud has dried
into red clay. An occasional tree
hardily disregards the prospect of
a late frost, and manages to bear
a few blooms for the waiting
world. But the biggest battle of
all was won last Wednesday; the
harbingers of Spring besieged the
ROTC building and triumphed —
the OD’s have been exchanged for
khaki's.

Manifestations of the equinoc-
tial transition stand out all over
the place. Pete Whittle’s voice
echoes up and down ‘etween the
dorms as he calmly advises his
track team, and is matched by the
roaring of engines as the daily
race begins for the Mooresville
links. The seersucker suit begins
to appear in store windows, com-
plemented by the standard array
of white bucks and ventilated
shirts. And everyone is waiting
for the local sect of Sunshine and
Health to make their first outdoor
appearance of the year and art-
lessly wallow about on blankets
and towels, absorbing a dose of
Vitamin D into their winter-faded
skin.

One of the peculiaries of nature
is the inverse proportion of the
state of dormancy between animals
and the other inanimate living ob-
jects of Nature. When the sap
starts to rise, the vigorousness of
the human begins to wane. Pro-
gressively more and more reason
is found for doing less and less un-
til there is all the reason in the
world for not doing anything. It
takes so much exertion to turn
around and stare out the window

‘that most students prefer just to

Stimulus for study has suffered
a severe setback. And any excuse
whatsoever is explored to the
fullest to keep from compromising
one’s self and hitting the books.
Wednesday nite Moose Lazenby's
spirit was buried on the west side
of Duke, complete with a cross,
wreath and the words “Rest In
Peace.” A prosperous hour and a
half were spent in this operation.
The Toilet-Paper Brigade is on the
warpath again too. Several of Mrs.
Little’s 1000 sheet Double Strength
rolls had wandered in various di-
rections over the dorm floors. It's
fascinating artistically, but some-
what aggravating to the individual
who goes to the head with a spe-
cific purpose in mind.

As we said before, the equinox
has passed. It is more than wel-
come, after three months of con-
stant precipitation. But by the
beard of Abdullah, how does one
get rid of this insidious Spring
Fever when he has 5 reviews com-
ing up?

they possibly give up the use

of a room on egch hall in

the dormitories for study pur-
poses? It sounds like s superb
idea, but is rather unrealistic.

Of course it may be argued that
when man has ceased to try he
should not-speak at all. The fight’s
the thing. Well, it’s part of the
thing. Results are also the thing.
And knowing what is the status
quo. It makes good copy to read
about the young man who goes out
unarmed to fight the dragon.

We seldom read of the man
who studied the dragon's, hab-
its, went out with proper
weapons and just es much
zeal, and killed the thing. Vet
we seem willing to vote for the
former man.

This is not intended us a per-
sonal slant at any candidate. It
is a hope that both speeches and
the attitude of the voters will take
on a more intelligent aspect.

In the logic text used by the
college, there is a section on emo-
tive terminology. How interesting
and at the same time sickening it
is to hear man after man make
an emotive appeal for his election
no matter whether he realizes it
or not.

“Friends we all know that
(but ave we sure we all know
it?) so and so needs illumina-
tion. If elected | will see that

this is improved (just what

does he mean by improve-

ment?), and that so and so is

remedied (what constitutes a

remedy in his mind?).”

All these words and scores like
them do not represent clear cut
ideas, but emotive responses. We
do not think when we hear them,
but we merely feel. It follows that
the man who uses the most words
which bring a good feeling wiil
win the election. Of course this
doesn’t happen. He must be popu.
lar and the “right” kind of boy.

This would all be very well
and good If we were selecting
the man whom we liked most
of all the boys on the campus.

Some will argue that, in light

of the vacuum of issues in

this academic paternocracy,
this is all we are doing any-
way.

Every so often some minor mat-
ter is in the students’ hands and
on those occasions we need a man
with a grasp of the situation and
something resembling a mind. A
speech by this type is usually
marked by specific and realistic
suggestions and feasible promises.

There are many underciass-
men who will find reason to
denounce bitterly the seniors’
attitude toward student body
elections. If they seem leck-
