The Newspaper Fund of the
Wall Street Journal is again of-
fering a number of $500 grants
to juniors in its summer Intern
Scholarship program.

The internships are designed
for those who are interested in
newspaper work as a career, but
whose school offers no formal
journalism instruction. Those re-
ceiving the grants will work in

the newsrooms of newspapers or
wire services during the sum-
mer of 1967.

Successful applicants will be
given the names of newspapers
which are cooperating in the
program, and the intern may
apply directly to these newspa-
pers.

Each intern will work at least
10 weeks full-time in order to

qualify for the $500 grant. It is
a supplement, not a substitute,
to the regular salary he will re-
ceive working for a newspaper.

Thirty-six newspapers and the
news services cooperated in the
program during 1966.

Further information and ap-
plications are available from
Louis Lesesne, editor of THE
DAVIDSONIAN.

Brothers.

“If the performers lost their
hearts over this thing. Vince
Foster and his whole crew work-
ed their hearts out to make this
a successful show.”

The Righteous Brothers them-
selves were accorded a warm
welcome by the audience.

The manager of the show re-
marked that the Gaylords humor
was tongue-in-cheek. ‘Our hiss-
ing is also tongue-in-cheek,’
Smith said, ‘‘and I tried to ex-
plain this to them. I tried to get
them to understand that this is

said, ‘Let's do a quick show and

(Davidson To Head

Historical Society

Dr. Chalmers G. Davidson,
professor of history and director
of the library, was elected pres-
ident of the Historical Society
of North Carolina at its meeting
in Chapel Hill last Friday.

Davidson is the author of sev.
eral volumes relating to the two
Carolinas. His Pledmont Parti-
san was included in the “One
Hundred Outstanding Books
about North Carolina’’ (from
Hakluyt’s Voyages to the pres.
ent) several years ago.

He is also the author of Cloud
Over Catawba, Gaston Of Ches.
ter, The Generations of David-
son College, and many pamph-
lets.

In 1951 Davidson received the
Charles A. Cannon award for
North Carolina history. He is a
past president of the Literary
and Historical Association of
North Carolina, the Mecklen-
burg Historical Association and
the North Carolinas’ Writers
Conference.

The society dates back to 1845
but lapsed during the period of
the Civil War and Reconstruc-
tion and was revived by the late
Dr. Archibald Henderson of
Chapel Hill in 19435.

Its membership is limited to
70 and only those are elected
who have published noteworthy
scholarly works relating to
North Carolina or have been out-
standing in their support of the
historical projects of the Tar
Heel State.

The Bell System has many small, automatic

telephone offices around the
country. The equipmentin them

could operate unattended for
ten years or so, but for a problem.

The many electric motors in those offices
needed lubrication at least once a year. Heat
from the motors dried up the bearing olls,
thus entailing costly annual maintenance.

To stamp out this problem, many tests

were conducted at Bell Telephone
Laboratories. Lubricant engi-

necr George H. Kitchen decided
to do a basic experiment that
would provide a motor with the

worst possible conditions. He deliberately set

out to ruin some ball bearings
