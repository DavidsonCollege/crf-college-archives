Woodrow Wilson
Foundation Brings
Lionel Barber to Campus

By David Thompson

“Anybody whois anybody has
an opinion on what’s going on in
the world,” said Lionel Barber of
his fellow journalists in-Washing-
ton D. C. Barber, this year’s
Woodrow Wilson Fellow, is the
Washington correspondent for
London’s Financial Times.

During his five day visit to
~ Davidson, Barber expressed his
own opinions regarding such mat-
ters as the life of a foreign corre-
spondent in Washington, breaking
into the world of journalism, and
the differing perspectives of Ameri-
cans and Europeans on aid to the
Soviet Union.

Barber’ s first speaking engage-
ment was at a welcoming lunch-
eon held Monday, October 14, in
the Carolina Inn. Describing his
understanding of the role of the
press in Washington, Barber drew
from his experiences as the Wash-
ington Post’s Lawrence Stone
Fellow in 1985.

Barber began to see the press;

as “part of the process” in Wash-
ington. Barber believes that jour-
nalists shouldn’t fear being “spun
around” or manipulated by politi-
cians. Once people know you in
Washington, he claimed, they will
be forthright. “Of course, they
have an agenda, but that we all
have,” Barber said.

When Ambassador Jack Perry
asked Barber whether he found
European newspapers to serve
readers more thoroughly than their

American counterparts; Barber. -

said yes. He noted that in most
cities one paper dominates the
market, and that the lack of com-
petition has inspired a decline in
quality.

Barber mentioned the lack of
foreign coveragein U.S. papers as
one of the most obvious shortcom-
ings. The problems, as he sees
them, do not stem from a lack of
information to publish, but a lack
of insightful commentary on the
news.

On Wednesday, Barber spoke
to approximately 75 people about
the disparities between the Ameri-
can and European understandings
of the events in the Soviet Union
since August. The status of the
Soviet Union now challenges as
anachronistic the grounds of U. S.
foreign policy since World War II.

Therelevance of the U. S. doc-
trines of nuclear build-up and
containment, as well as the Ameri-
can sense of a national mission
against communism have all been

‘called into question. Europe, in

Barber’s opinion, also faces chal-
lenges regarding its changing iden-

Turkey Manure Makes

College Environmentally Safer

By Tom Price

Since the early 80’s Davidson
has been among the few colleges
in the nation that have adopted
ground maintainence methods
which are non-threatening to the
environment. Irvin Brawley, who
has worked at the college for 21
years and is currently the Associ-

ate Director of Buildings and
Grounds, helped to bring these
methods to Davidson.

The technique Brawley has
adopted is referred to as Integrated
Pest Management, or IPM.
Brawley said that the main differ-
ence between this method and
others is that “nopreventive spray-

Reach Out & the Homeless
Insulted by Talk Show Hosts

By Tom Koonce
Last Monday, senior Beth
Mitchell, in charge of publicity for
Reach Out (YSSC), was hassled in
an interview (see transcriptof inter-
view on page 4) with two talk
show hosts of WCNT 1480AM.

After Mitchell did this, the two
men began suggesting their own
views about how a statement about
homelessness should be made.

The two believed that a sleep
out at Davidson would not accom-
plish much of anything and that
Davidson students would not take
this event very seriously. One of
the hosts suggested that the home-
less should be given “a copy of the

mented on-how the homeless
“don’t want to work.”

Mitchell remained calm and
continued to present the reasons

for why a sleep out would help
awareness and how other programs
at Davidson also contribute to
trying to solve the problem of
homelessness. McGuffin and
Clarke continued to make remarks
about the homeless such as calling

Connor House Closer to Reality

By David Smyth
The new women’s eating
house, should it come to fruition,
will be knownas the Connor House
as per a vote last Monday. night.
The name Connor derives from
Carol Connor Willingham, a 1977
graduate who is now an invest-
ment banker with the Equitable
Corporation and an active alumna.
Willingham was a hall coun-
selor, SGA representative, and
WDAV announcerasastudent and
has remained deeply involved with
Davidson after graduation. Will-
ingham was the first trustee to be
elected by the alumni association
and has been president of the Na-
tional Alumni Association.
Over seventy people have listed
their names as potential members

. and forty-seven women came to

the first house meeting. Very few
seniors are contemplating a switch
from their present houses, but a
good number of juniors are.

The present roll is composed
of current Rusk and Warner Hall
members who feel that their own
houses have grown too large for
any type of intimacy as a group

The class of ’93 has a particu-
lar problem in that many of their
friends are abroad for the term and
are not sure of their individual
loyalties.

Elections for Connor House
officers are scheduled to be held
tonight. As of Friday night only
one candidate was listed for presi-
dent, sophomore Sarah Way,
though nominations were still open
for consideration,

Meanwhile, the new group has

pressed on. A car wash was held on
Saturday behind the Cunningham
Fine Arts Building and posters have
been put up for the Athletic De-
partment. Connorites will also be
traipsing around the dorms and
peddling their culinary wares
Wednesday night for a bake sale.

-All of this activity is a collec-
tive effort to raise money for the
house, specifically a Friday After-
noon Club and other activities that
prospective freshwomen members
could participate in and get a feel
for what the Connor House is all
about.

bers to receive official college
sanction and occupy a Patterson
