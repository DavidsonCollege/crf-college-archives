A Week of Upsets

Wildcat sports dope is slim this week due to the lull
hetween the gridiron and court seasons, but action was
plentiful in other sections of the country as three stunning
upsets brought the topsy-turvy football season to a close.

Georgia’s crushing defeat of Tech vied with

Holy Cross’ trouncing of Bowl-bound Boston Col-

lege for the upset of the week. Of less national

import but equally surprising was Navy's decisive

}

win over the Army Cadets.

We had expected Sfitkwich and company to_ come
across ini close.game with the Engineers, but the con
vincing manner in which*the Bulldogs exerted their super

ority must have been a spectacle tee see,

Backing up a little, we must admit that we
thought it would be Georgia’s running attack that
would be the deciding factor in the game, while it '
turned out that the Athens boys beat the fleet-
footed Tech backs at their own game—passing,
and at the same time bottled up the Engineers’
chief running threat, Clint Castleberry. Frankie
was red hot again, and skeptics came away from
Sanford Field thoroughly convinced of his prow-
ess. Charlie Trippi, working in the mighty Sink:
wich’s shadow all season, was another big gun
in the Georgia attack, while Bill Godwin was a
standout at his line-backing position. Jim Todd
known to many Davidsonians~in past years at
Montreat, got in some good licks for the Bulldogs.

Georgia to represent the East in the Rose Bowl.:: The

Basketball Gets Underway

A tentative schedule for the basketball season
appears elsewhere on this page. It appears that
in spite of uncertainties with respect to transpor-
tation, a full season of play is in prospect. Changes
may be necessary in this schedule. but it is as com-

plete as possible at present.

glasses as they often do, but barring unforeseen complica-

conference race. Soph Jim Lowry has caught the
of-ecoaches and_has carned a starting berth in tomorrow's
game. Several of his classmates will add to the reserve
strength of the courtmen and may be expected to see

plenty of action in the near future

The controversy over freshman participation
in varsity conference games is to be decided next
week. Davidson has now joined the ranks of the
supporters of the move, for, though they have
little to gain through a positive decision with
respect to the basketball season, such: participa-
tion will be almost imperative if Davidson is to

continue football next year.

Freshman Award

Members of the Beaver Club feel that they
have taken a significant step in stimulating inter-
est in athletics at Davdson by inaugurating the
presetation of a medal to the outstanding Fresh-
man athlete. The idea has the whole-hearted
support of the Athletic Association, headed by

Mr.-Norman. Shepard. bes

Avnumber of awards are offered each spring to
Freshmen for excellence in various: types of scholarship,
but this is believed to be the first athletic award of its
kind, It is hoped that this award will attain significance
comparable with those tor scholarship. ~Officers-stressed

Georgia Wins,
Goes To Bowl

Boston College Upset; W & M
Takes Southern Title

In a series of dazzling upsets, the
grid world ended its last full week-
end of games Saturday, and the
Southern Conference wound up one
of the hottest races in years,

By virtue of their smashing 34-0
victory over a potent but over-
powered Georgia Tech eleven, the
University of Georgia gained, for
the first time in history, a claim to
the mythical, national championship
and a bid to the Rose Bowl game in
Pasadena New Year's Day. Holy

ginia Tech and others,

Tacksonville Navy, even though they
outgained the Flyers by a 2-1 major-
ity; Clemson bowed to Auburn 41

Team Won Lost Tie

In the last week of interfratern
ity football the S.A.E.’s_ clinched
the pennant for the second straight
year by scoring a 12-0 win over the
K.A.’s It was the 19th successive
victory for the Purple and Gold

In the other games of the week
the Independents defeated | the
S.P.E.'s, 6-0, and the Phi Delts Jost
to the Betas by a score of 12-6

With all of the games played off
with the exception of a tie, this
year’s interfraternity football sea-
son came to’a successful end

The tie, which was the result of
a mid-season game-between the
K.A.’s and the Phi Gams, will be
played off in the near future. The
result of this game will determine
the final standing of the two frat-
ernities, but will not alter the posi-
tion of the other teams.

Scheduled Matches Pending

Interest shown in the intramural
Wrestling tournament will deter-
mine the future of the varsity wrest-
lings team, [Equipment was issued
last week to all who were planning
to try out for the team; many took
idvantage of the opportunity to
wet a head start on practice.

From December 7 to December 18
the tourney will be conducted for all
four classes; it is expected that
treshmen will be eligible for the
varsity squad, There will be compe-
tition in about seven classes from
118 pounds to unlitited. The win-
ners in each of these groups will
probably start in that position on
the team

All. thos® interested at all in
wrestling are urged to sign up for
the tournament.-Five matches have
heen scheduled for the grapplers,
the first of which will be held in
January,” The team’s future looks
good; however, there must be
enough candidates out to warrant a
team. It is hoped that wrestling will
not die out at Davidson just be-
cause ot lack of interest
