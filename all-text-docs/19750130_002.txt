Plans Being Finalized

Spring Drama Blooms

and Frazier Marsh as The Player.

Written by English modern dramatist Tom Stoppard, the
* play focuses upon two minor characters in Shakespeare’s

“Whatever else it is, it is a comedy. My intention was
comic, and if the play had not turned out funny, I would
have considered that I had failed,’’ Stoppard said.

Gardner indicated his intention of highlighting the comic

“Stoppard’s techniques blend together to create a
fascinating evening of humor, style, and thought. We are
working hard to bring out all the humor in this terribly fun-

Admissions Policies Maintain
Homogeneous Student Groups

By ANDREW. LAMAS
Executive Editor

(Ed. Note: This is the final in-
stallment of a two-part series
dealing with admissions and fi-
nancial aid policies at David-
son College.)

As a result of the college’s ad-
missions policy, the Davidson
student body is_ highly
homogeneous, according to
Director of Admissions and
Financial Aid H. Edmunds
White.

Over 60 percent of the student
body have parents who earn
more than $20,000 annually.
Better than 14 percent earn
$50,000 or more yearly.

Less than 7 percent earn
fewer than $10,000 every year.

“Tt is obvious that Davidson
caters to a group of financially
elite,’’ said Vice President for
Academic Affairs John M.
Bevan.

Bevan indicated that David-
son would be unable to admit
students from low income
families if the college policy
concerning admissions were

altered. : ;

He argued that Davidson is
able to offer grants of sub-
stantial aid to some students
because a large percentage of
Davidson students require no
financial aid whatsoever.

“Only about 28 percent of the
students here receive financial
aid monies from Davidson,”
remarked an administration of-
ficial.

Working as a consultant for
the Ford Foundation last year,
Bevan reviewed the financial
aid and admissions policies of
about 180 colleges and univer-
sities.

“T observed that the schools
where 60 percent or more of the
students’ parents earned over
$20.000 that the number of ap-
plicants had not been declining
over the past few years.

“Yet, where less than 60 per-
cent earn $20,000, the schools
were losing applicants--the
number of applicants was
declining,”’ said Bevan.

This seems to indicate, said
Bevan, that a college ad-
missions staff must recruit its

New College Union To Open Next Year

By MATTHEW COVINGTON
News Editor

The new College Union will
probably not open until next
year, although the plans are not
fully finalized. This decision is
one of several made by a new
Union Board that took office
this month.

“We can get over there this
year but the sacrifice would be
heavy. Our use of the new Union
would be incomplete and inef-
fective,” said College Union
Director C. Shaw Smith. ~

‘‘We’d be without a clubroom
or a.snack bar this year. We’d
rather not do it if it means a

half-operation,’’ said Smith.

The affirmation of plans and
policies at this time is caused by
a partial finalization of plans
for the Union as a building. This
process of finalization includes
the hiring of an _ interior
decorator, Nancy Templeman
of J.C. Pease Co.

“We are getting to the fun
part in planning the Union. At
first it was difficult because we
had to decide which rooms we
wanted and what we wanted
them for.

“Now we’ve gotten into fun
things like the color pattern. We
will have rust, blue, brown, and
orange in the clubroom. In the

day it will be bright and
sparkly. At night it will be deep
andrich,’’ said Smith.

“These colors are versatile,
and so’is the whole clubroom,”’’
said Union Board President
Richard Wassen. ‘‘We want the
clubroom to be flexible and it
will be. We’ll have a balcony, a
dance floor, and a bar serving
draft beer.

“‘We’re going all out on the
clubroom and its going to be
well done,’’ continued Wassen.

‘“‘We expect to have a small
library in the lounge and a
game room, but we need
students to help plan these
before we move,’’ said Wassen.

Another decision made by the
new Union Board is to continue
the practice of charging studen-
ts for tickets to concerts. This
seemed to work well over Mid-
Winters, a fact that seemed to
encourage the board.

The ability to have two major,
well-known acts in one week-
end is attributable partly to the
healthy allowance of funds to
the Union by the College.
Tickéts were sold to these con-
certs, however, to help pay for
the entertainment.

“It’s a matter of arithmetic, ,
the revenue pays for a part of
the show. We took in $950' for
Weisberg and about $2500 for
Brubeck. This paid half of our
expenses for bringing them
here,” said Assistant Director
of the Union Rush.

“A lot of us who are paying 1
or 2 dollars to see-a first-rate
concert don’t realize that we
would be paying 2 or 3 times as
much in Charlotte,” said Smith.

A lot of students also don’t
realize that the Union currently
has enough money in reserve to
pay for Mid-Winters without it
costing the students anything.

“The Union, currently has
enough money to have financed
both the Weisberg and Brubeck
Concerts in its till. The things ,
we did for Mid-Winters could’!
have come right out f the till,
but it would have ::tymied our
program in the future.

“If we can pay $1(00-$3000 for

students with ‘‘this 60 percent
figureinmind’. .

Some Davidson ad-
ministrators posit that David-
son must remain a regional
school if it is to keep its
enrollment at an acceptable
rate.

Over 70 percent of the David-
son student body is drawn from
five southern states: North
Carolina, Georgia, Virginia,
South Carolina and Florida.

“We visit only a very few
states for recruitment purposes
outside of the southeast,’’ con-
firmed another member of the
admissions staff.

“We do draw some students
from Pennsylvania and Ohio.
And, we do or have done some
recruiting in these areas.”’

“This leads me to believe that
if we do more recruiting outside
the southeast that we will
receive more applicants from
other regions.

“Yes, I believe we can recruit
more people from outside of the
southeast,’’ said the staff mem-
ber.

“Davidson is not a
heterogeneous place, it’s a pret-
ty homogeneous place, and this
may not be good.”

Bevan also commented on the
regional base of Davidson
College.

“A lot of schools are going to
stand or fall on their ad-
missions. Coupled with the en-
dowment, tuition is the most im-
portant source of income for a
college.

“Davidson is a _ regional
school. We recognize that. Yet
more and more we have been
getting students from outside

' (the Southeast.)

‘We must continue to main-
tain a strong regional base but
also reach out beyond the
region.

“With college admissions
declining across the nation,
there are going to be people
reaching into our region that
haven’t done so before.

“So, we’re going to have to
strengthen our regional base
and search for good students
from other areas,” said Bevan.

A student committee on ad-
missions was formed in Decem-

DUFF BRUCE

ber of 1974 under the leadership

: of sophomore Kar] Goodhouse.

“We met only twice and
I’ve had to turn over the com-
mittee to Bo Baskin.”’’

Assistant Directors of Ad-
missions Larry J.Barr and Duff
Bruce have expressed interest
in the student committee on ad-
missions and financial aid.

“We met a féw times but
mainly for organizational pur-

poses (

“T see it (the wos of the
committee) as if away
some of the mysteify that
surrounds admi'ksions |
procedures,” saidBarr. >
