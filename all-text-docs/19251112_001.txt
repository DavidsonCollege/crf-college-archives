third quarter, Hampden-Sidney tied the
Davidson Wildcats in a game made thrilling
by the work of the Tiger backfield. Doped
to lose, the Virginia team was unable to cope
with the offense that Jim Hendrix led in the

first half, but came back strong in the last’

-two periods. Atkins, injured as the game
was closing, was easily the star of the game,
his brilliant running and catching of passes
bringing the tying touchdown to the Tiger
eleven and threatening the Davidson goal in
the last quarter.

After the two elevens had exchanged punts
in the first quarter, DickGrey caught the
Tigers flat-footed on a punt from midfield
which Pinkney downed on the one yard line.
Hampden-Sidney punted out but Grey raced
the ball back 18 yards to the 32 yard line.

Davidson drove the ball into scoring position
twice in the second quarter but field goals
went wild in both cases.

The drivg of the Tigers started as Atkins
broke loose for 20 yards. Palmer, Edmunds
and Brinser supported him ably as the Tigers
marched thtough Davidson, Atkins finally
going over the line. Tom Baker stayed in
the limelight as he smothered a perfect place-
ment, thus tying the score.

The Tigers were the first eleven that have
been able to sweep the Davidson ends, while
Davidson could not cope with their passing
to Atkins, Dudley played great on the Tiger
line while Vance tore up many of the Vir-
ginia plays.
