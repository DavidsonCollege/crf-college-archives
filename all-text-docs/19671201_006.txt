The Davidsonian

Richardson Fellows
To Restudy Program

By GEORGE ALLEN

Staff Writer

The Richardson Fellowship program
is undergoing a period of self-evaluation
which Mike Mooty called ‘a healthy and
necessary stage in the group’s develop-

ment.”

This evaluation is taking the form of
both praise and criticism from the or-
ganization’s 12 members,
Mooty, student chairman of the pro-
gram founded last spring.

One of the basic problems is that Fel-
lows have not defined and agreed on a

Committee Seeks
Drill Pranksters

Investigation of pranks dur
ing recent ROTC drills has
been turned over to the .In-
vestigating Committee of the
Student Council.

Buddy Newsom. commit
tee chairman. said last night
he had already talked to sev-
eral students about the inci-
dents and planned further in-
vestigation.

The matter was turned over
to Newsom's committee by
ROTC Brigade. Commander

students throwing water. on
the troops from a. third floor
window of Belk Dormitory ac-
cidentally. knocked down a
screen, which struck a cadet.

The cadet. David Sams. a
freshman, was not seriously
injured.

Several weeks ago cadets
marching back to Belk were
pelted by water balloons
from a fourth floor window.

IFC Clarifies
Rules On Rush

The Interfraternity Council
has made changes in the rush
regulations for the informal
rush period of the first se
mester. According to Bobby
Vagt. vice president of the
IFC, the changes were made
to clarify the existing rules.

The Council changed Rule
IV. part three. to read: ‘No
freshman shall be allowed at.
fraternity parties."” The rule
previously specified parties
registered with the Office of
the Dean of Students.

A new rule has been drawn
up in order to clarify the
definition of a party. The new
party rule defines a party as
“any activity carried out in
proportions that leave the
rushee with a corporate
image of the fraternity.”

The IFC also set up some
guidelines for applying the
new definition. At the frater-
nity houses only four fresh
men are allowéd at any one
time. At social gatherings
only five brothers and three
freshmen are allowed.

Social gatherings include
parties at private homes. mo
tel parties and trips to com
mercial establishments. (This

that the organization's activities should
be more directly related to Davidson
and its student body. ,
same students questioned
whether the funds for sponsoring the
12 members are being used as profitably
as they might be if they were given di-
rectly to the school.

Another major criticism from the
group concerned its inactivity.

“This is the type of program that de-
mands that something happen,” said
one member. “So far not much has

The reasons for the stand
still seem to be that the
members do not have enough
time to work on the program
and that the group itself is
not so well organized as it
should be.

Mooty attributed the lack of
organization to the nature of
the program itself.

“Because of the flexibility
of the program, it will always
be in the organizing stage.
The Richardson Foundation of
Greensboro gives the finan-
cial means to accomplish any
end which Fellows feel is de-
sirable.

The program can then de-
velop according to what the
group feels is necessary to
accomplish as a group and
to what the individual feels
is necessary to accomplish as
an individual.”

In response to the com-
ment that the organization
was not beneficial to the
school, Mooty said, “Since
the established school activi.
ties serve almost every prac-
tical purpose conceivable, I
would like to see the Richard-
son Fellowship program per-
form a creative function for
the school and community.

“I think that the organiza-
tion can make a unique con-
tribution to both the school
and the community in its de-
velopment of responsible col-
lege graduates,”

In answering the statement
that the program was a sta-
tic, Mooty listed the activi-
ties that the organization has
participated in up until row.

These activities have in.

cluded seminars with lawyer
Hugh Cannon, Congressman
George Burns and Theodore
Runyun. a representative of
Candler School of Theology at
Emory University.
- The group also attended a
conference at Chapel Hilt on
the problems of the 1980's.
Also at this conference were
the Richardson Fellows at the
University of North Carolina
and Ohio University.

Fellowship is a great pro-
gram because its scope

ed one. “The program wasn't

fit but rather to train men to
take responsible positions of
leadership when they grad-
uate.”

The same Fellow agreed,
however, that the program
“got off to a slow start and
had some salvaging to do."

Mooty reported that this
“salvaging’’ might take the
shape of an activity oriented
program for the fellows.

The newly formed Student

new faculty committees
recommended by the Blue

off to a strong start, com-

chairman.

“There are going to be
some good results coming out
of it... said Tom Earnhardt,
Student Council president and
one of three students serving
on the committee.

The mood of optimism
seemed to be the consensus
among committee members.
Dr. J. B. Stroud, associate
professor of mathematics and
secretary of the committee,
said, ‘‘I think it's a very
healthy exchange.’

The -professor of historical

ological generations — pre.
Barthian, Barthian, and post-
Barthian — which are fre-
quently in conflict,

The second problem, he
told the largely absent—
physically or at least men-
tally—audience. is the prob-
lem of the necessity of con-
verting the church from ru-
ral and. agricultural orienta:
tion to urban and industrial.

The final problem ‘is, he
said, that the church—and
especially the Presbyterian
Church—has too closely iden-
tified the life of middle class
society with the Kingdom of
God.

In this way, modern Pro-
testantism presents a_ real
peril to society in that it
cannot distinguish really im
portant issues from those
which are transient and rela

One of these is that the Stu-
dent Council, having only 15
members, is not large enough
to represent the student
body effectively.

Another criticism is that
the present representation is
based on class groupings.
Bates has said, however,
classes have become less im-
portant at Davidson than resi-
dence hall groups, and more
representation should there-
fore be based on the residence
halls.

Election and structural
weakness in-the present Con

further criticism.

Higgins and Allison are fresh

man Council.

tively unimportant.

To illustrate this point, he
quoted briefly from a mod-
ern poem which presented
the modern clergyman and
laymen prescribing a guar-
anteed method for success in
the modern world: ‘‘to spit-
polish your shoes and cut
short your hair.”

The seminary professor,
speaking in the tones of a
Sunday morning sermon,
reached his conclusion of

the existence of three such
problems for the church by
speaking of major periods of
theological develop ment
which profoundly affect the
individual raided in a Pro-
testant culture and ethics.
Those periods were, as he
saw them, the Protestant Re-
formation, the consolidation
of Protestant theology, the
crisis of the Enlightenment,
the Barthian era and the
modern, post-Barthian era.

48 Applicants Accepted

On Early Decision Plan

Forty-eight high school
seniors were accepted at Da-
vidson this week by the Ad-
missions Office on the col-
lege’s early decision pro-
gram.

The number represents a
slight drop from last year in
early decision acceptances.
according to Jon Regen. as-
sistant director of admis-
sions.

Regen said approximately
75 had applied for early de-
cision, also a drop from last
year.

The purpose of the early de
cision program is two-fold,
Regen said.

“From the standpoint of
the applicant who is sure that
Davidson is where he wants
to go. it enables him to com-

also stressed the newness of
the committee.

Earnhardt, however, said
that the committee had made
definite progress in several
areas. One of the commit-
tee’s earliest recommenda-
tion was that at least two
students should serve on all
faculty committees.

The committee also delib.
erated for several of its
weekly meetings on the pro-
posed Residence Hall Asso-
ciation Constitution. How-
ever, due to a conflict be-
tween the new Student Body
Constitution ‘being prepared
by a Student Council commit-
tee and the Residence Hall
Association Constitution, the
subject was deferred until
the conflict could be resolv-
ed.

Burts stressed that, the
committee was not commit-

ted to any principles at the -

outset, and that the purpose
of establishing the commit-
tee was to re-examine David-
son's social, intellectual and
religious life.

In particular Burts said
that the committee was not
committed to the principle cf
loco parentis. He said that
the committee was re-evalu-
ating this idea along with the
other principles underlying
the present faculty rules and
regulations.

‘‘We want to work out the
dichotomy on campus be-
tween the faculty regula-
tions and the student body
regulations,”’ said Earhardt.

Earnhardt said that the
committee is also dealing
with the problems of drugs
and liquor on campus.

Members of the committee
are Chairman Burts, Secre-
tary Stroud, Professors R.. D.
Kaylor, Norman Johnson, T.
A. Williams, W. G. Work-
