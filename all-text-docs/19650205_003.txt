THE DAVIDSONIAN

The spectre of “Greek Week” is once again concluding

with a furry of ‘“‘*monogramm

which always seem to appear better on paper than in the

execution.
But in the transformation

from ‘Hell Week” to “Greek

Week.” the object seems to remain the same if the methods
have been tempered. That object, it would seem, is to subject
the not-so-pitiable freshman to such harrassment as to de-
fine clearly (if symbolically) his position as “pledge.”

Tradition weighs heavily. however.

Thus, marching to breakfast, certain dietary transformations

in Davidson’s Greek Week program to spark the most avid
of crusaders. As a second semester senior, one feels more
a compulsion to observe what color is available and leave
the deep thinking to the appropriate and right-minded in-

dividuals and the appropriate

committees.

The last four years have witnessed the demise ,of the
oft-chastised pledge skit. Replacing that venerable tradition.

23 Students Leave "
As Semester Ends

At the end of first semester
Davidson enrollment decreased
by 14 students. While re-admit-
ting nine former students, 23
others left for various reasons.
The total broken down by class-
es are: three Freshmen, six
Sophomores, nine Juniors, and
five Seniors. The five Seniors
were completing their require-
ments for graduation. The other
,Students left for various rea-
sons; the majority were trans-
fers. The total broken down by
reasons for leaving are: five
for graduation, eight transfer-
red. two for the Washington
semester sponsored by the Po-
litical Science department, two
for independent travel in
Europe, and four for other rea-
sons.

The students who are re-

At the end of first semester last
year there were 20 students who
left school. The three freshmen
who left also is in relation to
past years.

Mrs. Peter Nicholls,
visor of dormitories, stated that
the problem of space in the
dorms that existed at the begin-

room. She said that the big
problem now was to get those

reet End Of Week

1
In two of the past five years there has been vocal com-
petition among the pledge classes. But this year the feel-

ing seems to prevail that a melodious voice is not a neces-
sary ingredient for a good Greek.

Above the innocent festivities stand the administrative
authorities—the Ajax charger of the fraternity court—ready
and willing to enforce the restrictions on hazing.

It is true. perhaps, that the future of national fraternities
at Davidson is precarious. But this past week the noise and
activity obscured the doubts and questions. The beginning.
if not always the end, of “brotherhood” at Davidson is a
spirited occasion and worthy of pleasant memories.

Sir Winston Inspired
World By His Example

By MICHAEL LIGHT

Richardson Scholar From England

So often, more than. ideas and words alone is required for effective lead-
ership and must be supplemented by some form of personal example. Ever since
the campaigns in which he had fought in India and Africa during the 1890's, Sir Win-
ston had displayed virtue, daring, valor, bravado: conf‘dence,

all unquenchable energy in

Thus, during the last war.
when he faced every danger in
order to exhort and encourage
his men, his personal example
was of the greatest inspiration
of all British and Allies, there-
by commanding for him the ut-
most respect and admiration.
With his unbounding energy.
Churchill fought relentlessly to
the bitter end. Time after time,
during 194042. setbacks and
failures occurred, but never
once did Sir Winston show any
sign of flagging.

Not only was Churchill a re-
lentless worker himself, but he
was also wholly demanding of
his subordinates. As a diplomat,
he displayed all the charm and
courtly manners of a prince; yet
he stood his ground. and he was
demanding of his diplomatic
rivals as any drill instructor in
demanding of his troops.

As someone who displayed the
fine uses and values of a knowl-
edge of history, Sir Winston's
example was first-rate; he
showed. too, deep political fore-
sight, much of which was ig-
nored to a greater or lesser ex-
tent. He foresaw the Nazi dan-
ger during the 1920's. yet his
warnings went continually un-
heeded. His excessive fears of
the extensive use of explosive
energy were voiced during the
1920's. During the last war, he
was very quick to appreciate
the impending danger of com-
munism: he too, originated the
term the “iron curtain”.

all he did.

Churchill did not say in 1940. of-empty words. He was always |

“I know I can save this country
and that nobody else can’. as
Chatlan had in 1756. Churchill
may have thought and hoped he
could, but he did not know he
could save his country. When
be offered only “Blood. sweat.
and tears.” he did the most any
man could have done—he gave
everything to his country.

Sir Winston Churchill has for
many years been the idol of
British youth. It is magnificent
too how much his life has been
admired not only in the United
States, but throughout the world.
If any one of us. in attempting
to emulate any single facet of
the great Sir Winston’s brilliant
life. should achieve any meas-
ure of success. he will have
done so nobly.

Sir Winston Churchill was a
figure of legendary proportions
during his own lifetime.

It is quite impossible for our
generation to conceive of the
dire situation faced by Great
Britain, and most of the West-
ern World. in 1940. Sir Winston
Churchill was thrust into power,
and led Britain, the Common-
wealth. and the Allied Powers
in one of the most remarkable
single efforts of the modern
world.

Sir Winston held more cabi-
net posts than any other poli-
tician. He was twice First Lord
of the Admiralty, at the com-
mencement. respectively, of
each of the World Wars; twice
Prime Minister in 1940-45, and
1951-55. He was outstanding as
a leader, politician, diplomat.
administrator, soldier. orator
and painter. Sir Winston’s ex-
ceptional qualities are reflected
severally in each of these fields.

Churchill realized his own
greatness. Without being overly
pompous and superior, he was
able. knowing his position, to
direct and contro! everybody
and everything. No one could
tell him what to do. but anyone
could offer him counsel.

As a leader of the people he
was ideal, and he was able to
inspire hope and confidence into
the minds of a dejected and
fearful people. His outstanding
command of the English lan-
guage added so much emphasis
to his ideas, and it was some-
times almost his words alone
that carried him and his peo-
ple through crisis after crisis.

Sir Winston was not an orator

authoritative and thoroughly
well. informed. During the war !|
not the slightest detail escaped:
his eagle eye or grasping mind.
He astounded his senior Minis- |
ters by displaying at. least as:
much knowledge as them in

their own fields. He would never
express an idea or plan with-
out a wholly sufficient number
of facts with which to back it
up. To be uninformed was, in
his eyes. the greatest of sins.

Nobel Prize-Winning Physicist
Presents Philosophy Of Science

By TED GLUSMAN
and MIKE MAY
Davidsonlan Feature Writers

As he first appeared on
the stage of Hodson Hall
Monday night, one’s first
impression might have been
a touch of concern and pity
for this hesitant, wizened
little man with the short,
frail steps and weak smile.
He seemed, perhaps, unsure
'Of where he was and what
jhe was to do.

Then as he began to speak.
his thick Hungarian accent ob-
scuring his first words, that in-
tial compassion was forced to
give way to a deep admiration
and respect. Just as Davidson
sat charmed and entranced by
the literary brilliance of poet
Mark Van Doren last autumn.
so did it stand in fascination
and awe of the scientific and
philosophical genius of Dr.
Eugene P. Wigner, February's
Reynolds lecturer.

Wigner, (pronounced ‘‘Veeg-
ner”) spent Monday and Tues-
day at Davidson lecturing, dis-

cussing, and teaching. He came
well-qualified as a _ scientist.
having won the Nobel physics
prize in 1963 and the Enrico
Fermi Award of the Atom Ener-
gy Commission in 1958. He is
Professor of Mathematical Phy-
sics at Princeton University,
though at present he is doing
research in nuclear physics at
Oak Ridge.

His first contact with the Da-
vidson student body and faculty
was probably his finest show-
ing. He spoke that first night

on his own philosophy of science..

In spite of “‘Greek Week" and
numerous other campus acti-
vities. the hall was nearly full,
and Wigner was at his best. His
topic. was “Understanding.”
which he called ‘the theme of
our epoch.”

Understanding he defined as
the discovery of regularities.
“We want to formulate regular-
ities,” said Wigner. ‘That is
Science.’ -He went on to talk
of the limits of science, asking
what it is possible for man to
understand. In the past. stated

the physicist, men have believed
that it was possible to under-.
stand everything. Now, however,
we speak only in terms of prob-
abilities. not absoiutes.

After his formal presentation.
Wigner remained to answer the
eager questions of almost 50
students and faculty members.
Students deseribed him = as
“witty”, “completely dedicat-
ed”, “brilliant, and ‘very fas-
cinating. both his content and
his personality.”

Tuesday, Dr. Wigner spoke
in assembly and at a physics
seminar on the same topic: the’
promises and dangers inhérent,
in the rise of science. He ox-!
pressed sevéral times his fear
of too much development of |
the ‘‘mental sciences”, such. as
psychology. At present. opined
Wigner, “only concerning inan..
timate objects have we been’
able to develop a coherent set,
of regularities which are reason- |
ably complete.” But he expects |
man to bridge this gap in the

near future, and he admitted. -

(when a questioner compared
development of mental controls
to development of nuclear
physics). “I am more scared of
psychology than I am of physics.
Much-more scared.”

Wigner made a deep impres-

sion on the Davidson student
body. especially those who heard
him two or three times. He
seemed to project and to gen-
erate in his listeners his own
excitement at the marvels of
science and _ philosophy of
science.

Last night they presented the
‘first performance of David
| Richey’s ‘Caprice for Violin and

Cello"—written especially for
the Drinkalls. Richey is assist-
' ant professor of music and piano

ate study at Catholic University
of America and at the Univer-
sity of Iowa. (Beginning his
study at Eastman School of Mu-
sic in Rochester at the age of
three, he was the youngest stud-
ent ever at Eastman!)
