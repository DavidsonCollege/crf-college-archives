The Davidson soccer team,

games in a:period ‘af a week

their final conference battle

“ Phe Wildcats “defeated Fur- = scored early, scoring on a

man in overtime 2-1, but lost
to Appalachian 5-1.

In the game against Fur-
man, also a conference foe, the
Wildcats could not seem to get
untracked— making bad pas-
ses, not hustling, breaking
fundamental rules—against a
team obviously not their e-
qual. Furman scored first
when Goalie Doug Schuessler
couldn’t find the handle on a
shot and a Furman player
rolled in the rebound.

Davidson retaliated with a
head shot by leading scorer
Dave Patton on a throw-in
from Pete Sluiter on Furman’s
narrow field. The second half
was scoreless, as both teams
appeared to be playing kick-
ball rather than soccer.

Early ‘in the first overtime
freshman Mark Noel headed a
high shot into the left corner,
and Davidson held on in the
remaining overtime period for
the 2-1 victory.

Against Appalachian State
the Wildcats played better but
cameuup on the short.end of
the 5#I, s¢oré: Appalachian

20-yard shot ricocheting off
the back of a teammate,
catching goalie Doug Schuess-
ler off balance. The rest of the
first half remained scoreless,
despite golden opportunities
by Davidson.

Appalachian’s first score of
the second half was a wicked
ten yard indirect kick off the
right post. Later, Davidson
scored on an equally tough
indirect kick by D.C. Augus-
tine, bouncing off the goalies’
hand into the upper corner.

Appalachian quickly scorea
two goals, one after another,

-on short breakaways, and

scored the finishing goal on a
tough dropping shot slipping
from Schuessler’s hands in the
cold and wet.

War Kiwis c

By THE

BODACIOUS TA-TA’S

We would like to thank the
refs for the libel suits they
slapped up with. They fit well
and we are wearing them
proudly. Besides they keep
out the chill of the oncoming
winter.

‘*Touchdown’”’ Joe Winkle is
a legend. Until last week
“Youchdown”’ Joe had a niche
secured for him in the Flicker-
ball Hall of Fame.

He said no reason to worry
and didn’t bat an eye as his
Fiji #8 team confidently took
the field against the feather-
brained freshmen War Kiwis.
Winkle had pounded out at
least one touchdown in 37
consecutive games and was
sure of continuing that streak.

However, the peewee Kiwis
dropped upon him like bird
(excrement deleted) and the

‘streak was snapped.

In addition, the Fiji’s were

. further humiliated when the

War Kiwis buried them in a
pile; 18-7. The Kiwis offered a
high flying candidate for Rag
Man of the Year. Although he
will remain anonymous, he did
play quarterback.

Jeff Morrow intimidated the
high strutting Gang Bangs
when he scored three touch-
downs and two joints, leading
the fire-breathing ae toa
44-0 blow-out.

Pre-game warm-ups involv-
ing deep breathing exercises
and the fact that the referees
were provided by the Bangs
were cited as the main factors
in the victory.

The House, impotent, but
not a bad freshman team,
could not muster up enough
big plays against Off Again,
who with our luck will never
lose.

Davidson, N.C.

hoke off Winkie’

Winless EMBO locked ear

lobes with Cannon II in an

inconsequential game repre-
sentative of the lower echelon
of of the sport. Both teams
were simply ghastly; however,
Thom Young, dynamic hall
counselor for Cannon II made
an appearance in time to spark
the bumbling freshmen to a °
‘*come from ahead’’ victory

- over the incorrigible diners of

lowly delights, 31-13.

In what was termed the
‘‘most exciting flickerball
ever played...’’ by many old
timers, PDT #1 turned.Porky
Pig into a sizzling heap of
bacon. PDT #1 finally pre-

vailed over the woeful hams,

27-20, who turned off the
crowds with the wallowing
antics.

Big Daddy Conosco’s family
took an early lead but .was
unable to hold on as Doggie
Style came from behind to pull
it out in the end, 41-18. The
rabidly-foaming, mangy mon-
grels came on the field in blis-
tering heat to waste the family
of Big Daddy Conosco.

PDT #2 grounded the Fly-
ing Phalliin a rare overtime
contest. After battling it out
to a 19-19 stalemate, the
second fiddle PDT team gain-
ed the decision by churning
out the most yardage in the
overtime.

Those perennial partiers of
old, I Tappa Keg, failed to
provide enough bodies for
their get-together with sixth
Watts, thus placing the vic-
tory in the hands of the
skyscraping girls from Watts.
