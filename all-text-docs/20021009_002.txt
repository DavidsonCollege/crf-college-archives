crowd as to whether they thought the school
had at least “some insincerity” in its recruit-

ment of minority students, everyone in atten- -
. dance raised their hands. When asked if the ©

school is “more insincere than sincere” in its
admissions tactics, a vast majority responded
affirmatively.

Finally, when the group was asked if they
thought that the school is genuine in its inten-
tions to heighten diversity, only one student
raised her hand in agreement.

Yet the school insists that diversity re-
mains a central goal. Davidson’s Statement of
Purpose says, “As a college that welcomes
students, faculty and staff from a variety. of
nationalities, ethnic groups and traditions,
Davidson values its diversity and seeks to be a
community that recognizes the dignity and
inherent worth of every person.”

Despite such a seemingly earnest commit-
ment to diversity and equality, Davidson ad-
mitted a record low number of minority stu-
dents into this year’s freshman class. In addi-
tion to the drop from last year’s number of 19
percent of the entering class consisting of mi-
nority students, there are only 14 African-
Americans in the class of 2006.

Assistant Dean of Students Ernest Jeffries
attended the meeting and offered insight on the

debate. In response to this year’s low minority
admission rate, he told the group, “We hit rock
bottom this year, and that is pathetic.”

Jeffries also joined the group’s conversa-
tion on the middling state of interracial affairs on
campus.

“Everyone here has a prejudice,” he said
later. “The bottom line is, we’ve got to start
treating people like who they are, not who we
think they ought to be.”

The crowd spent a bulk of the remaining
time reflecting-on Jeffries’s words, coming to
the conclusion that the possibility for change

necessarily hinges on both group and individual -

effort.

Stated Lee, “What makes this college? The
students. Where is the change going to have to
start? With the students.”

Despite two hours of constructive conversa-
tion, all participants were fully aware that the

- struggle to bring change would not be easy and

that it would not come quickly.

Lee summarized the mood of the group, ~

concluding, “It’s going to take more than one
discussion like this to change things.”
