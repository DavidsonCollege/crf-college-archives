Author William Styron highlights convocation

By CHRISTI BAGGETT

William Styron spent last Fri-
day at Davidson to present the Ve-
reen Bell creative writing awards,
receive an honorary degree, read
from his works, answer questions,
and give a short introduction to the
movie based on his novel Sophie’ s
Choice. On receiving his honor-
ary degree, Styron spoke with
honesty, affection, and humor
about his year as a Davidson stu-
dent.

Styron was uncompromising
in his description of Davidson in
1942. He recalled the strict rules
— the prohibition of alcohol, the
required Bible study — and his
own accustomed profligracy.
“My innate sinfulness was in con-
stant conflict with the prevailing
official piety,” he said.

He speculated that his father
had sent him to Davidson to keep
him from a life of dissipation.
“But I think,” he concluded, ‘“‘he
underestimated my _ resourceful-
ness.” Styron told of losing his
virginity to a “professional
woman” in Charlotte who worked
at the Green Hotel, “which, I un-
derstand, now lies mercifully
under a 40-story building.”

In those days, Styron re-
ported, there were no blacks at
Davidson, and no women (“only
dreams of girls’), and no Jews,
“and I think four Yankees. The
rest of us were all sandy-haired
Southern WASPs.”

He commented on the David-
son social life of 1942, saying that

though the world was at war
Davidson students talked only of
pledging fraternities. Styron re-
membered that he had been a Phi
Delta Theta pledge and _ that
Mooresville had been “‘as exciting
to me as Marrakech. Or Atlanta.”

Styron admitted, “I recollect I
was the most miserable freshman
in the state of North Carolina,” yet
explained that much of his unhap-
piness at Davidson stemmed from
the general anxiety about World
War II. Styron joined the Marines
at thé end of his freshman year,
then studied at Duke University,
where he received his under-
graduate degree.

Styron read from his novel
Sophie's Choice and entertained
questions on it and on his other
works, which include The Confes-
sions of Nat Turner and Lie Down
in Darkness. Professor Anthony
Abbott commented that listeners
asked “very interesting questions”
and that Styron had good answers.

To one listener who asked
how he, an American male, could
presume to speak from the charac-
ter of a Polish woman (Sophie), he
responded that he did not consider
himself simply “male.” All of us
contain both masculine’ and
feminine elements, he explained,
and to illustrate he quoted Gustave
Flaubert’s declaration, “Madame
Bovary c’est moi.”

To another, who asked
whether Sophie was doomed from
the start, he replied that in a sense
she was, for those who are treated

constantly with violence and
hatred, those who have human
dignity stripped from them by
other human beings — like Sophie
at Auschwitz — learn to seek their
own destruction.

Friday night Styron stood
again on the stage in Love Au-
ditorium, this time to talk briefly
about the film based on Sophie's
Choice. He spoke with respect of
Mery! Streep and said that the
makers of the film had done a
good job of adapting it from the
novel. He recalled that French cri-
tics had complained about the
movie's downplay of the passion-
ate. sado-masochistic nature of
Sophie’s relationship —_ with
Nathan; Styron agreed that such
dilution of the novel was perhaps
the film’s biggest fault.

“T think Mr. Styron really en-
joyed his time here,” Abbott said.

Abbott also recalled.that dur-
ing the post-Convocation lunc-
heon Styron had described his cur-
rent project: a novel tracing the
changing attitudes of people to-
wards war, which will begin with
World War II and extend through
the Korean and Vietnam Wars.
“He’s working with war’s psy-
chological effects on people, not
on exclusively Southern mate-
rial.”

Anne Lambert, winner of first
prize in the Vereen Bell competi-
tion, called Mr. Styron “a very
gracious man. Very nice, and very
friendly. It really struck me at the
luncheon that he was always lean-

William Styron speaks at Spring Convocation:

ing over to include my mom in the
conversation. He didn’t even
know her, he’s just met her, but
still he wanted her to know what
was going on.”

Styron, a Newport News, Vir-

ginia native, now lives in Rox-
bury, Connecticut.
Explaining that Styron is a 61-
year-old man who has recently
suffered serious illness, Abbott
commented, “This was the first
major thing he’s done since he’s
been sick, and I think it helped
him realize that he could still do it
— still function, be witty, use
words well. And of course David-
son was a really supportive com-
munity for him.”

About Styron’s remarks at
Convocation Abbott said, “I
found them appropriate and inter-

Robert Nesbit

esting. They weren't meant at all
cynically of aragingly, | think

— they were€riticism combined
with nostalgia.”
“Maybe the truth doesn’t

hurt,”” Abbott laughed. “He told
us honestly what Davidson was
then, and we can listen and see
what's better now, and what's not
better now. Maybe that’s one of
the functions of the artist. °

Asked whether Styron would
consider himself a “Southern
novelist” Abbott replied, proba-
bly not, or less and less so. “His
first novel had a Southern pro-
tagonist, but his two last ones Nat
Turner and Sophie's Choice in-
volve characters whose experi-
ences are quite different from Sty
ron’s own — a slave, and a Polish
woman, a prisoner at Auschwitz.”

Student-built shanty torn down by administration

By ANDY BARRON

Last Friday night, four stu-
dents built a shanty and placed it
on Chambers Lawn to protest
apartheid in South Africa and to
end apathy in the Davidson stu-
dent body toward the apartheid
issue.

Less than six hours after the
shanty was completed, college
workman dismantled it.

Director of College Relations
Jerry Stockdale said that school
administrators ordered the des-

Inside

truction of the shanty due to
Chambers Lawn being part of
Davidson College’s “historic
area.”

“Students are free to erect
structures at other areas of the
campus,” Stockdale said. “There
will be no effort to try to curb
those protests.”

The four students involved
(freshmen Jay Barron, Greg

Busby, Kevin Dunn, and Michael
Schill) built the shanty late Friday
night on the soccer field and then

carted the construction to Cham-
bers Lawn at about 3 a.m.

“It looked like a piece of
trash,” Schill said, “just like a
shanty should look.”

Busby and Schill stayed with
the shanty until Supervisor of
Custodians William J. Barker ar-
rived at 6 a.m. and told them the
structure would be taken down
while the Lawn was being set up
for Alumni Weekend.

The idea to build a shanty
came from a flyer distributed by

Andy Lamas, director of Alumni
Against Apartheid. Chambers
Lawn, the sight of protests by
groups such as Amnesty Interna-
tional, seemed like the best place
for the shanty.

“Other worthy causes have
been allowed to demonstrate on
Chambers Lawn,” Busby said.
“However when the shanty was
put up, the lawn was declared an
historic area and the shanty torn
down.”

“It seemed more important
that the grounds looked good for
the alumni than it was for the stu
dents to voice their opinions,”
Dunn said.

The students were concerned
mainly with ending what they sce
as complete apathy on the part of
the Davidson student body to the
issue Of apartheid.

“T's time that students got out
of their eating houses and into the
real world,” Schill said.
