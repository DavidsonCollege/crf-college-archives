Prices at the Union - are we getting a good deal?

By Brap D. CuasE

the Union Cafe is done with Bonus
Bucks, many unsuspecting custom-

- ers pay little attention to the cost of

You’ve got five minutes be-
fore your next class and all of a
sudden you havea life-threatening
candy urge. Heading over to the
Union Cafe to pick up some candy,
you feel pretty smug knowing that
Bonus Bucks are going to cover
your little addiction.

Putting a scoop full of candy
into a plastic bag, you take it it up to
the counter and just out of curios-
ity see how much your little treat
will cost. Then, like a speeding
train heading toward you, you re-
alize that the small bag of candy
goods is going to cost you a whop-
ping $2! It’s just Bonus Bucks you
tell yourself — they don’t matter.
But what happens when all of the
Bonus Bucks are gone and you
have to use cash again?

This scenario is becoming
more common at the Union Cafe.
Prices for the Tropical Fruit and
Nut Company candy went from
30¢ an ounce before Winter Break
to the present 45¢ — a 50% in-
crease in price.

Upon exiting the Union Cafe
with a look of disbelief, freshman
Cameron Martin recently ex-
claimed, “Three dollars for acouple
of gummy bears? What a rip off!”

Prices on other goods seem to
have mysteriously increased also.
Quenching your thirst these days
‘ will cost you another 50¢, if you
want a recyclable plastic cup. A
“Davidson Recycles” plastic cup
used to run you a mere 99¢ but
those days are gone. The new
market price is $1.49.

Since the bulk of business at

their snacking habits.

Freshman Ralph Morehead
comments that “it seems like they
have a monopoly on campus. [The
College] doesn’t give us many
options as to where we can spend
our bonus bucks so the Cafe can
pretty much set their own prices.
Since we want to use our Bonus
Bucks, we end up. paying those
ridiculous prices.”

Julie Mills, manager of the
Union Cafe, says that “[the Cafe]
is more like a convenience store.
The prices are more like a conve-
nience store and not a supermarket
such as Harris Teeter or Dover’s.”

She blames the higher prices
at the Union Cafe to “lack of stor-
age space and the fact that we
purchase in smaller quantities than
larger stores and have to pay higher
prices forthis.” She adds that she
“had done a survey between some
convienent stores in the area last
year and our prices fell right in line
with these other stores.”

Mills says that the increase in
prices of the Tropical Fruit and
Nut candy selection is due to the
supplier’s price increase that the
Union Cafe must pass on to its
customers. “We were forced to
raise the prices for [the customers]
because Tropical Fruit increased
the price at which we purchase the
candy” Mills says.

A Harris Teeter representa-

tive says that the chain has not.

Fruit and Nut candy and has no
plans to do so in the future.

Kurt Holmes, “The policy will be
enforced. Students in general will
not like the change until they un-
derstand where it comes from. It
does not have to do with control of

alcohol. It has to do with keeping
the court safe.”

has a set mark-up in order to cover
expenses such as labor, utilities
and maintenance. She declines to
disclose what the actual markup is.
She says however, that one of the
largest chunks of her budget is
devoted to labor.

Despite the high labor costs,
the Union Cafe has one of the
highest starting wages on campus
and also employs no work-study
Students. Mills says, “No one
seems to want to work the late
hours so we have to pay them
more.”

However, the library is open
just as late as the Union Cafe and it
employs a staff of work-study stu-
dents at lower wages.

tween the Union Cafe and Harris‘

As war ravaged the world in
1914, the battles across the Atlan-
tic may have seemed far removed
from the lives of Davidson’s 335
students.

In October of that year, talk
of the campus centered around a
student-led excavation of a hu-
man skull from the one of
Chamber’s south columns. Dis-
appointingly, the remainder of a
mysterious skull, long rumored
to have been hidden in this col-
umn, was not discovered.A month
and a half later, however, a front
page article appeared in The
Davidsonian concerning the Red
Cross’ appeal to colleges across

the country to help relieve the suf-
fering overseas caused by the “Eu-
ropean War.” “Never before in
history,” the article ran, “has there
been such need for aid.”

Within a week, Davidson stu-
dents had contributed over $30 to
military medical care in Europe.
By way of comparison, Davidson’s
annual tuition at the time was listed
as $60. By 1918 the US. was itself
deeply involved in world war.
Articles and editorials about the
fighting in Europe filled the pages
of The Davidsonian each week.
Students were urged to “make the
comparison between our sacrifice
and that of England, and... havea
meatless day each week.”All stu-
dents were organized into compa-
nies which reported for military

drill each day. Initially sched-

uled for the afternoon, drill was

soon moved to 6:45 a.m. in order

to allow for afternoon baseball

practice. Davidson alumni and

current students who travelled

across the Atlantic to fightin WW

I were recognized by the addition’
of blue stars to a flag displayed in
front of Chambers. By the war’s
end, nearly 600 stars adorned this
flag.

February 5, 1919, The
Davidsonian printed the Memo-
rial issue. While celebrating the
WWI’s end, students ‘mourned
the deaths of 17 Davidson alumni
and dedicated this issue “‘to the
memory of the Davidsonian men
who have made the supreme sac-
rifice.”
