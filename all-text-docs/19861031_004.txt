Hindawi was convicted in London Fri-
day. In a show of support for Britain, the
United States and Canada withdrew their
ambassadors to Syria.

The British government called on the
Soviet Union, which has consistently
been a Syrian ally, to reject. state-sup-

moving towards further agreements to
prevent more terrorist bombings from oc-
curting in Frarice.

A Soviet expert said his government
might have to publicly disclose minutes
of the Reagan-Gorbachev meeting in
Reykjavik to rebut President Reagan’s

meeting. U.S. Assistant Secretary for
Defense Richard Perle said such a disclo-
sure would be “an unprecedented viola-
tion” of diplomatic practice. The White
House said it would continue to ask the
Soviets to agree to drastic cuts in
medium-range missiles despite Soviet

opposition to S.D.I.

nician Mordechai Vanunu had sold sec-

Speaker highlights US/Soviet future

By MARK CHEN
‘Dr. Jerry Hough, described by
Dr. Jack Perry (Rusk program di-
rector) as.one of the leading schol-
ars on the Soviet Union today,
spoke in the 900 Room on
Wednesday.

itiative. By hanging tough, the
U.S. will get an agreement which
cuts nuclear stockpiles while leav-
ing SDI alone. If you believe this
argument, then the U.S. has a per-
fect position for getting every-
thing it wants. - - :

A graduate of Harvard, Hough
is a professor at Duke University
and a member of the Brookings

Institute. Hé has written articles .

for Foreign Affairs and appeared
on CBS and ABC. He discussed
his own view of Soviet politics for
now and the future during his talk
here.

According to Hough, the
short-term perspective on U.S./
Soviet relations looks bad. The
expulsions and Limits on Soviet
diplomats at the* United Nations
are bound to create problems with
Gorbachev. In a fit for tat move,
the Soviets have taken all their
employees out of the American
embassy in Moscow. The em-
bassy is now short of cooks, ser-
vants, cleaning ladiés, and even
translators. As for arms control

agreements, there will probably—

be no progress on those talks for
the next six months.

Hough. blames miich of this
impasse on the’ Reagan adminis-
tration. Too many American
policymakers believe that the

Soviets need an agreement on nu-.

clear arms. Because of this need,
- the Soviets can be forced to “cave
_in” on thie Strategic Defense In-

But Hough argues that Gor-
bachev is better off with terrible
U.S. relations. Gorbachev has al-
ready proved his toughness by ar-
resting Daniloff and expelling
American diplomats. What Gor-
bachev really needs are agree-

« ments which reduce the number of

tanks, planes, and troops. They
are the truly expensive military
items which eat up the Soviet
budget. Gorbachev is more likely
to make an agreement on conven-
tional arms with the Chinese and
NATO, than on nuclear arms with
the U.S.

Instead Gorbachev can use the
threat of SDI as a reason for
economic reforms. The Soviet
economy is in terrible shape and
needs to be stimulated with less
government control and more

American defense shield. The
Soviets have to innovate and
‘change now before the Americans
leave them behind in the tech-
nological arms race.

The best feature of SDI is that
the Soviets -will not have to in-
crease their military spending.
SDI will probably be no danger to
the Soviets for the next five to ten
years. So Gorbachev can talk up
the American “evil empire” as a
reason for economic reforms,
without having to sacrifice those
reforms to-a new arms buildup.
Gorbachev has followed this pol-
icy, taking a very hard line against
the U.S. For now, Gorbachev can
be happy with no arms control
deal at all.

For the long-term, Hough sees
a soviet Union with a powerful,
though weaker, Communist
Party. Since all nations — demo-
cratic or dictatorial — seek to in-
crease their influence and power,
competition will continue be-
tween the U.S. and the Soviet

‘market competition. However,—Union. -In this competition the

‘such reforms would mean higher
food prices, greater unemploy-
ment, and greater competition for
Soviet companies from Western
imports. In order to make the
Soviet people accept these costs,
Gorbachev can use the ‘threat of
SDI. Unless the Soviet economy
becomes more technologically ad-
vanced arid competitive, then the
Soviet Union will be faced with an

Soviet Union will have to remain
unified and powerful.

If democracy ever came to the
Soviet- Union, then the country
would be torn apart. Soviet Mus-
lims will make up 30% of the
Soviet population by the 21st cen-
tury. A free Poland would demand
territory lost to the Soviets after
World War II. All the different
ethnic groups, with their different

languages and cultures, would de-
mand to become free and indepen-
dent. The fear of anarchy is why
many Russians see Andrei
Sakharov as a traitor, a man who
wants to destroy the Soviet Union
with his calls for democracy. Re-
forms might weaken Party control
somewhat, but most things will
stay the same.

The greatest changes for the
Soviet Union will be in interna-
tional relations. War no longer
makes any sense in the interests of
economic security. Economic re-
sources, like oi! and wheat, are
cheap and abundant. There is no
need to conquer places which pro-
vide such goods. All conquest
brings is a rebellious people who
must be constantly watched.
Japan does not have a strong mili-
tary, but is the most prosperous
country in the world. The best
way to become prosperous is to
train and educate people, not try to

conquer an empire.

Neither can war guarantee na-

tional security. Nuclear war is un-

winnable and cannot be fought.
Already capitalism is spreading to
nations in the Third World who
need # revive their economies.
Instead these nations have to-open
up their markets in order to grow.
The truly powerful nation in the
world is Japan with its economic
strength. ,

It is that'example which Gor-
bachev wants .to follow. In the

past, the Russians have been very -
eager to change and adopt West-
ern ideas. In the last decades of the
Czars, Russia was becoming a
very moder, capitalist economy. .
Many Russians traveled to the
West and were eager to learn. His-
torically the Russians have been
very open to new ideas.

Today Soviet leaders are com-
ing to power who are in this Rus-
sian tradition. They grew up and
matured after World War II, in the
new atmosphere of openness after‘
Stalin. They like Western ideas
and want to use them for the
Soviet Union. Gorbachev is a
young man who has enjoyed
Western culture such as rock and
roll, jazz, and Western clothes.
His wife Raisa is up to date with
her Paris fashions and American
Express card.

Hough points to many Soviet
measures taking place which
herald this change. Recently a
British politician went on Soviet
TV and said that the Soviet Union
in Afghanistan was like the U.S.
in Nicaragua. Hough himself has
published an article in the Soviet
Union which attacks Soviet sec- -
recy. A Soviet friend of Hough
has told him that there is no need
to be a dissident in the Soviet
Union, that almost anything can
be published today. A new gener-
ation, born after the trauma of Sta-
lin and World War HI, will con-
tinue to change Soviet society, ac-
cording to Hough.
