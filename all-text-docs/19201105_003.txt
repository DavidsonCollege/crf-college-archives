MILITARY SECTION OF
| ANNUAL TO BE INCREASED

The 1921 Annual management did not
| realize the great part that the R. O. T.
C holds at Davidson, when they left

‘Rut nevertheless,
than six pages. To do this, it was de-
cided that each private pay 50 cents,
corporals, 75 cents, etc., and the captains
$1.75.
' Friday night, a thrilling campaign was
| started and $114 were realized. That
much was received in about one hour's
time, and $220 is the fixed goal. When
this amount is received, we will be as-
sured of the following:

Three pages devoted to military de-
tails, such as, headquarters, staff offi-
cers, etc.

Two pages for each company and the
band.

Two or more battalion pictures in
characteristic formation, and as many
miscellaneous pictures as funds will
allow.

This will only be giving the R. O. T.
C a partial showing. It is hoped that

us only six pages in the new Annual.
we will have more

the above action will establish a pre-
cedent, and that in coming years, the
Annual management will leave at least
35 pages for the R. O. T. C. to use as it
pleases.

PARENT-TEACHERS’ ASSO- |"

CIATION HOLDS MEETING |

The Parent-Teachers’ Association to-,
gether with the Civic League gave a
pleasant reception to the teachers of the
local school at the League Hall on Tues- i
day evening. There was a spirit of good
fellowship throughout the mecting
which promises well for the betterment
of the school. Abundant and delicious
refreshments were served by the ladies
of the club. \

A spelling match was organized by Dr.
Wilson MacConnell with Miss Shaw
and Dr. Richards as team captains.
These captains exercised their rank and
refused to spell contenting themselves
with asking hard wards to their oppo-
nents, while Dr. MacConnell gave some
weird rulings in regard to the spelling
of certain words ignoring the author-
ities recognized by Professors Erwin,
and Shewmake.

The final split came on. the word:
“Chautauqua ;” one group, headed by Dr.
Martin and others, insisting on omit-
ting the “U" of the first syllable. After
debating it, Dr. MacConnell ruled that
the proper spelling of the word was
“Co-operation ;” that all patrons of the
school should get together and make the

next Chautauqua a bigger and better,

one, for all proceeds were to go to the
local teachers for improving the school,
continuing the policy of. the present
guarantors who gave the profits of this
season to the teachers.
