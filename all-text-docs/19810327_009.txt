Puffs!”

Most of us will remember this
anthem blaring time and again
between The Jetsons and Scoo-
by Doo as we sat entranced on
those magical Saturday morn-
ings. At the time few of us
realized television’s tremendous
effect on our psychological de-
velopment; we hadn’t the hind-
sight of twenty years. Psychol-
ogy Professor Edward Palmer
has for the better part.of twenty
years been interested in televi-
sion’s effects on-children and he
has recently edited a book on
the matter entitled Children and

the Faces of Television, pub- .

lished by Academic Press.
‘Studies in the field were
fragmented, and I wanted to
pull them all together,’’ Palmer
explained. He realized that a
great deal of study had been
completed in three areas of
television’s influence on child-
ren—violence, selling and
teaching. Each area had become
a major issue, and each had an
extensive history. Palmer com-
piled years of studies by several
individuals into a work which
now brings ‘‘synthesis and fo-
cus” to the complex field. Some
of the conclusions the book
draws are startling.

Palmer notes that because
television is a powerful teaching

tool, its violence often teaches |

children aggression as a way of
life. Certainly violence makes a
vivid impression on young
minds, regardless of whether
the bad guys get caught by the
equally violent good guys in the
end.

In the near future violence
levels on television are not
likely to drop: an extensive
survey recently concluded that
television violence levels have
not dropped since 1969.

The government is reluctant
to take a firm stand on televi-
sion violence fearing violation of
the first amendment.

Yet we reap what we sow; the
violent lifestyle children learn to
emulate certainly does not deter
new and startling crime waves
which splash across front pages
and invade quiet campuses.

Violence sells, and that is
very important to television
networks. Children and the
Faces of Television reveals sub-
tle ways television treats vio-
lence to make it most appealing
to the bulk of American view-
ers. For example, most aggres-
sors are white, middle class and
male. Their victims are usually
members of ethnic groups, wo-
men, the poor or the elderly.
The majority of the viewing
audience is not threatened, and

the children are given thou-
sands of violent role models.

Television can sell violence,
but it also sells products, and
the children’s market is lucra-
tive. Unfortunately, many pro-
ducts sold on television to
children are less than whole-
some, and some are harmful.
Many people are concerned with
unhealthy food products such
as some cereals on the market
which are 50% sugar. “It is
ironic,’’ Palmer cémmented,
“that while we adults place a
great emphasis on health with
our jogging and other athletic
pursuits, the child is being
inculturated into an unhealthy
syndrome.”’

The methods used to sell are
often just as damaging. Some
advertisements call attention
away from the product to a toy
prize inside. And because child-
ren rarely understand that they
are being sold to, they are
bombarded with advertise-
ments. Until recently, one hour
of children’s programming had
18 minutes of advertising, al-
though laws have now limited it
to 94% minutes.

Advertising is also a source of
child-parent conflict, simply be-
cause the parents do the buy-
ing. We can all remember
whining for half and hour trying
to get our parents to buy
“Marvel the Mustang” because

syec ology Professor

he’s “almost for real.” Some
genuine resentment probably
followed.

Palmer points out that adver-
tising can be used constructive-
ly; it is an effective teaching
tool. The greatest example of
its constructive use is Sesame
Street. This program has a-
dapted the idea of cartoon
characters, such as “Big Bird,”
and uses them to sell ideas
instead of products to children.
Like advertisements, the pro-
gram has a fast pace to keep the
child’s attention, and it. uses
cartoon segments. Sesame
Street is distinguished from
other children’s educational
programs in that it studies the
‘‘market’’ beforehand just as

dwara
potentially both constructive and destructive. (David ' d'McCurry)

Palmer sees television as

advertisers do. ‘Many y educa-
tional programs haven’t the
money to conduct such studies.

One of the strongest conclu-
sions of Children and the Faces
of Television is that television is
a highly effective teaching tool.

There are certainly problems
involved in changing some un-
desirable things children learn
from children. The book does
deal with the realities of change,
such as decisionmaking, influ-
ence and the problem of fund-
ing. But ultimately, it asks one
important question: Will we the
public decide to use this power-
ful medium for the degeneration
of the amelioration of our
children, and hence our society?

.Shi recalls struggles of a public life

By JOHN KROTCHKO

Features Editor
History Professor David Shi

describes the ‘“‘literary intellec-
tual’”’ as a writer actively in-
volved in the larger political /so-
cial issues of his day. His
recently published book Mat-
thew Josephson: Bourgeois Bo-
hemian (Yale University Press)
explores the life of one of
modern America’s most promi-
nent literary intellectuals in
terms of the struggles which
shaped both his public and
private life. Shi sees Joseph-
son’s life (1899-1978) as ‘‘a
lens” through which ‘‘to focus
on the broader developments
and trends in the cultural and
literary history of his period.”

The book traces Josephson’s
development from an ‘‘art-for-
art’s sake aesthete”’ to the liter-
ary intellectual. Josephson
joined the apolitical ‘‘lost gen-
eration’’ of American expatri-
ates in Europe in the twenties,
dabbling in Dada, imagism, free
verse and other new forms of lit-
erary experimentation.

In 1927, after his return to .

the United States, he was
commissioned to write a bio-
graphy of Emile Zola, whose

successful ‘literary’ attacks on .

French anti-semitism : inspired

_ Josephson to reconsider his _
: career as'a writer in terms.of his

“social obligation”’ as a citizen.
With: other American writers,
he took a more vocal position in
American affairs, editing the
leftist magazine The New Re-
public and writing popular and
influential political novels.

Josephson never gave up his

purely literay aspirations, and
his unresolved struggle between
these and his sense of social re-
sponsiblilty dominated the rest
of his life.

“The tensions are what gave
his life its dynamic,’’ Shi said.

Shi’s research led him to
Josephson’s private papers,
which the family allowed him to
use. They “‘opened up for me a
whole new person,”’ Shi said.

The journals revealed another
major role struggle in Joseph-
son’s life which none of the
other sources even hinted at.
“Throughout his career,” Shi
writes, ‘‘his creative and ac-
quisitive instincts were at war;
the struggle between living a
life of art and earning a living...
constituted one of the major
hidden tensions of his life.’’
Josephson had to reconcile
the necessity of his family, his
middle-class income, and his
job on Wall Street with his

bohemian yearnings, Marxist
sympathies and apartment in
Greenwich Village. That these
paradoxes caused ‘‘self doubts”’
and ‘‘anxieties,’’ Shi said, was
not apparent from his public
image or the impressions other
writers had of him.

Shi has woven this personal
element into the fabric of his
book to produce a more compre-
hensive, penetrating ‘‘intellec-
tual biography.’’ He writes:

In probing the inconsisten-
cies and paradoxes, false starts
and second guesses that were a
vital part of Josephson’s life, I
have relied extensively on his
correspondence and his private
journals....These sources and
emphases best reveal Josephson
as he was: a man for whom the
tense relationship between pol-
itics and literature, journalism
and art, bohemian and bour-
geois, provided the mainspring
of his life and career.
