The Wildcats capped off
Dartmouth Coach Gary Wal-
ters ‘return to Davidson bas-
ketball with an inspired per-
formance which produced a
59-54 victory over his Big
Green.

The players hadn’t forgot-
ten Walters. Lively voiced the
sentiment of the team when he
said, ‘‘The coach (Walters)
gave us a dirty deal. He ran
out on us. He didn’t have the
faith to get the job done.”

Lively added, ‘‘We all wan-
ted to win the game. We felt
we could win. The freshmen
knew how much the upper-
classmen wanted to win it.’’

The students didn’t forget
Walters either A large banner,
recognizing Walters as David-
son’s only undefeated basket-
ball coach, was paraded about
at halftime.

Walters was also given
eight roses from the cheer-
leaders for his eight days here,
and a note wishing him as
pleasant a stay as last year’s.

Davidson was sparked to
victory by hot shooting from
Marvin Lively and a tough
defense which forced Dart-
mouth to shoot form the
perimeter.

Lively had his best offensive
night of his career. He was 8
for 10 from the floor and a
perfect 4 for 4 from the free
throw line for a game-high 20
points.

Marvelous (as Marvin is
known by the press) hit most
of his shots from close to the
right baseline. After every
bucket, Lively ran down the
court, his arm raised up,
enticing the defense to tough-
en up.

The defense

usually

responded. Davidson denied
Dartmouth the inside game
most of the night, resulting in
a less than sparkling 42 per-
cent shooting performance for
the Big Green.

Davidson, not faced with
the customary height disad-
vantage it has had in previous
games, outrebounded Dart-
mouth, 39 to 28 as Pat Hickert
pulled down 13 and John
Gerdy 9.

Davidson took command of
the game early; a basket by
Lively put Davidson ahead
17-10 at the 10-minute mark of
the first half. Davidson stret-
ched its half-time lead, 29 to
23, to 14 points at 44 to 30
midway through the second
half.

The Cats coasted form then
on and only the shooting touch
of Larry Cubas, who led
Dartmouth scoring with 19
points, and some missed Da-
vidson free throws made it
close.

Coach Pritchett said, ‘“‘We
missed some free throws when
we were up by 14 or it
wouldn’t have been as close.”’

Davidson sorely needed the
win. Lively said, ‘We finally
won a game that was close.
We’ve been in a lot of close
games, but they’ve all gone
the other way. We found out
what it was like to win again.”

The Cats reverted to fami-
liar form against the Athletes
in Action, however, as they let
another game slip away, los-
ing 80-74 in overtime last
night.

Coach Pritchett substituted
freely as Lively explained,
“He (Coach Pritchett) wanted
to get some other guys some
playing time togetner, to get
used to pressure situations.”’

The second team consisting

PAT HICKERT adds two more Wildcat points as
he drives through the Dartmouth defense.

(Irv Wilson)

of Mark Summalt, Rick Per-
key, Locke White, Carter
Todd and Danny Hock com-
bined to score 17 points and
played the Athletes in Action
even when they were in the
game, including the first ten
minutes of the second half.

The starting squad rallied
from a 60-56 deficit, by em-
ploying an effective zone trap
defense, to claim a 66-60 lead
with less than 1:30 remaining.

The cats grew careless,
though, and the Athletes in
Action came roaring back to
knot the score at 66 all, and
force_an overtime.

Davidson held between a 2
and 4 point lead in overtime
until Harry Sheehy, who had
25 points for the game, hit two
free throws to put the Athletes
in Action ahead 76-74. The
Athletes in Action went on to
win by six.

Although it will be hard to
rebound from such a disap-
pointing loss, Pritchett has
been pleased with the team’s
intensity: “Our kids come to
play every game; they’re cha-
racter people.”’

While pointing out the
team’s stellar defense
throughout the year, Pritchett
remarked, ‘We must get bet-
ter in offensive poise and
efficiency. We do it in spots,
but it’s really hard for two
sophomores, two freshmen
and a senior who’s been on the
bench to learn to play to
gether.”
