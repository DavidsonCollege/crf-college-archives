The Davidson Wildcats ex-
tended their season last night with
a dramatic 70-63 victory over the
South Carolina Gamecocks in the
opening round of the NIT.

Stephen Curry ’10 led the Wild-
cats with 32 points, including 5-9
from three-point range. Andrew
Lovedale ’09 chipped in 17 points
and nine rebounds while Will Ar-
chambault °10 added eight points
and six rebounds. Devan Downey
led South Carolina with 18 points.

The game was sloppy and dis-
organized, with 51 fouls and 37
turnovers creating a choppy feel to
the game as neither team was able
to pull away in the second half af-
ter the Gamecocks erased an early
11-point deficit. Both teams were
guilty, as Davidson committed 19
turnovers and 24 fouls to South
Carolina’s 18 turnovers and 27
fouls.

Not even the coaches were safe.

from the whistles, as Gamecock
coach Darrin Horn received a tech-
nical foul with 8:40 to play after
vehemently criticizing the officials.
Curry’s two foul shots gave David-
son a 55-51 lead, part of an 11-4
spurt that broke a 51-all tie and
gave Davidson the lead for good.

Archambault’s lay-up gave
Davidson a 62-55 lead with five
minutes to play. South Carolina cut
the margin to five twice in the clos-
ing minutes, but Curry scored his
team’s final eight points to account
for the final margin.

The Wildcats started the game
on fire, streaking out to a 25-14
lead with five minutes to play in
the first half. Curry picked up his
second foul on the next possession,
however, and without him David-
son gave up a 12-3 run to end the
half and ended up clinging to a 28-
26 edge at the intermission.

The Gamecocks continued
their momentum in the second haif,
grabbing a 44-43 lead on Downey’s
lay-up with 13 minutes to play. Af-
ter a timeout, Curry buried a deep
three to restore Davidson to a two-
point edge.

South Carolina would tie the
game twice more, but would never
regain the lead. Davidson broke
the final tie (51-51) on Lovedale’s

lay-up before Horn’s technical foul
gave Davidson just enough mo-
mentum to bring the game home.
Foul trouble dogged both teams
throughout the second half, as Da-
vidson lost starters Stephen Ros-
siter °10 and Max Paulhus Gosselin
’09 for the majority of the second
half after each picked up his fourth
foul early in the second session.
However, the Wildcats ultimately
benefitted from the close officiating
in the second half, as South Caro-
lina was whistled for 14 fouls over
the final 16 minutes against four on
Davidson over the same time.

Dan Nelms ’10 was the only |

Wildcat not to commit a foul, hav-
ing played only six minutes. The
only Gamecock not to commit a
foul was Robert Wilder, who was
credited with a single minute of ac-
tion. Twelve of the remaining 17
players were charged with at least
three fouls. Interestingly, Rossiter
and Zam Frederick of South Caro-
lina were the only players to actu-
ally foul out.

Davidson nearly threw away
its chance to win with poor foul
shooting. The Wildcats shot only
16-30 from the charity stripe for
the game, or 53 percent. Davidson
managed to out-shoot the Game-
cocks from the floor, shooting 47.1
percent (24-51) to their opponents’
37.5 percent (21-56). The Wildcats
also owned a significant edge in as-
sists, recording 16 to South Caro-
lina’s seven.

The loss ended South Caro-
lina’s ten-game winning streak in
the NIT. The Gamecocks had won
the tournament in 2005 and 2006.
It also ended South Carolina’s
eight-game winning streak over
Davidson, which reduced its deficit
in the all-time series between the
two clubs to 39-26. Davidson also
handed South Carolina its third
home loss of the season.

The victory ensured that Cur-
ry’s spectacular career as a Wildcat
will continue for at least one more
game. He has been named a final-
ist for the Wooden Award and Nai-
smith Awards, both awards for the
national player of the year. He has
also been named a First Team All-
American by the Sporting News
and the U.S. Basketball Writers As-
sociation. He has yet to comment
on whether or not he will enter the
NBA Draft after the season.

The Wildcats will retum to
action later this week against St.

Gaels defeated Washington State
68-57 on Tuesday night. Patty Mills
scored 27 points to lead three Gaels
in double figures.

The Davidson men’s baseball
team toppled Elon, the SoCon pre-
season favorite, 7-1 Friday night
at Elon University’s Latham Park.
Elon struggled to tally three base
hits on Friday night against the sti-
fling Davidson pitching staff. The
Davidson lineup equaled this total
in home runs, belting three to fuel
their dominating performance.

The victory cemented David-
son as a serious contender in the
Southern Conference. Davidson
avenged Elon’s three game sweep
of the Wildcats last year. The Wild-

away from equaling last year’s four

Late goals down Cortland

The Davidson women’s §la-
crosse team played SUNY Cortland
on Thursday night at Richardson
Stadium. Davidson had an im-
pressive match and captured a 13-
10 victory over the Red Dragons.
Davidson then.took on Loyola on
Sunday and fell 20-3. Their record
is now 5-3.

After two goals by Liz Wall ’12
at the 26:30 and 22:27 marks in the
second half, Davidson leisurely
cruised to a 10-4 lead scoring five
goals in the first ten minutes of the
second half. The cushion may have
made Davidson too comfortable as
the Red Dragons came surging back
to bring the game within one at 11-
10 with 5:48 left in the second half.
Davidson collected themselves af-
ter the run, illustrating their depth
and composure while regaining

control of the match. To close out
the game, Heather Frohman ’09
and Jenna Muegele *12 scored two
crucial goals to put Davidson up
13-10 and seal the victory. In ad-
dition to Frohman’s and Muegele’s
clutch efforts, goalkeeper Michelle
Pav ’10 made multiple saves in the
final minutes to secure the victory
and registered eight saves for Da-
vidson.

On Sunday, Davidson showed
their weariness as they played their
fourth game in seven days against
Loyola. Davidson allowed 13 first
half goals and looked very tired.
Tallying two of Davidson’s three
goals was Jen Crawford ’10 who
recorded her 18th and 19th goals
on the season. Wall recorded her
third collegiate goal after register-
ing two on Thursday versus SUNY
and Davidson fell 20-3.

moved to an overall record of 8-6
with the win.

Thomas Middour ’10 picked up
the win for the Wildcats, allowing
only one run on two hits in six and
two-thirds innings. Middour was a
horse for the Davidson staff, toss-
ing 111 pitches in the victory. Mike
Frongello ’11 and Matt Webb ’09
finished off the game with two and
two-thirds of solid relief, only giv-
ing up one mn on a solo shot by
Melillo in bottom of the eighth.

Centerfielder Brett Shore °09
led the attack, going three for six at
the number two spot in the lineup.
Drew Gadaire ’12, Chase Fitzpat-
rick ’09, Chris Fitzpatrick ’09 and
Seth Freeman ’12 also had multi-
hit performances to propel David-
son to seven runs on 13 hits.

The ’Cats took an early lead
when Freeman took Elon pitcher
Ken Ferrer deep to left to start the
third inning. The bats continued
to heat up in the fourth when Pat
Brady °09 tripled to left and the
next batter, Drew Gadaire 712, hit
a two mun bomb. A final home run
came in the eighth inning. An error
put Danny Weiss ’10 on base and ~
Chase Fitzpatrick capitalized with
a two run shot to left-center.

The Wildcats’ planned double-
header against Elon on Sunday was
cancelled due to rain. As a result,
the team’s next game is a SoCon
battle against Wofford in Spartan-
burg, S.C. on Friday. The team will
look to pick up their fourth SoCon
win and in the process equal their
total number of conference wins
last year.

On Tuesday, March 17, David-
son traveled to Columbia, SC to
battle the Gamecocks of the Uni-
versity of South Carolina. The
*Cats suffered a 6-0 loss, dropping
their record to 8-7 overall and 3-1
in conference play.
