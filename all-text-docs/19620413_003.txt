My first order of business will be to thank Steve
Clark for the fine job that he has done as Sports Editor
for the past year. I don’t think that many people will dis-
agree if I say that he consistently put out a good sports

page.
LEFTY DOESN’T REST ON LAURELS
Coach Lefty Driesell isn’t resting on the laurels of his
freshman team. Talking to him gives the impression that
he’ll be bringing some boys here next year as good as
this year’s crop.
"He had Bill Helkill, a 6’4” forward from South
Bend, ind. visiting campus last weekend. Bill aver-
better than 20 points a game last year. This
weekend he will be bringing down two more excel-
lent prospects to look over. One of the boys, John
Hellings, is a 6'7” star from Bristol, Penn. John,
who averaged 18 points and 19 rebounds per game
last year, is Lefty's number 1 big-man prospect for

next fr.

The offer boy, Dick Snyder, is a forward from North}
Canton, Ohio. He aver: 19 points 7a ome last P cu
yand played in the No: “South game in Ohio,
for w the state’s best ten or twelve players are
chosen. Dick also made the first team all-state in football,
and was chosen to the Scholastic Coach All-American
Football squad. Driesell classed Snyder, who stands about
6’4”, as “a good jucper” and “‘a good outside shooter.

It looks like Lefty will have a rough job deciding who
will receive the approximately three scholarships
to offer for the coming year. At present he is consider-
ing six or seven top prospects.

The date for next year’s Davidson-Wake Forest
basketball clash has finally been set for Feb. 20 in the
Coliseum. This is the second ‘Cat basketball game sched-
uled for the Coliseum next year, since we meet Princeton

| the

there on Dec. 29. The a

t is also at-

tempting to schedule yet another basketball game in the
Coliseum for the coming season. These es will test
the ability of Driesell’s to draw big crowds.
TENNIS T 'Y ON JUNE 10

_ The Southern Juniors and Boys Tennis Tournament,
held here every Summer, has been scheduled this
for the week of June 10. This tournament, held in co-
operation with the Southern Lawn Tennis Association,

Some of the ers in this tournament are national
champions in age groups. All boys 18 years old and
younger are enter.
L FOR THE FOOTBALL FIELD?
i has been submitted by the athletic de-
t for the football field, and, al
lights cost a good deal, it seems that it
be a worthwhile investment for the college. If we had

to use the Memorial

Davidson’s baseball squad, although currently hold-

a disappoin 2-10 record, still has the tial to
re pe ie showing for the season. If they can
just snap their batting slump; which is the team
average at a low .180, they have a chance at

the Southern Conference Championship, since only two
of the team’s loses are to Southern Conference teams.

Last Saturday Davidson’s sharpshooters walked away with first place honors in take part in this program. This
the North Carolina Invitational ROTC Rifle Tournament in Raleigh. This marks the
third straight year that the ’Cat firers have won the tournament, thus permanently

retiring the trophy which now stands in Johnston Gymnasium.

The tourney, held on two
successive weekends, March 31
and April 7, was participated in
by ROTC teams from all over
the state, including Wake For-
est, Army, A&T Army, N.C.
State Army and Air Force, and
U.N.C. Navy and Air Force.

The ‘Cat firers won the

tourney by a total of only two
points, 2769-2767, being push-
ed closely all the way by the
N.C. State Air Force team. On
March 31, the ‘Cats posted a

was full of praise for all the
boys who participated.

The members of the team who
went to the tournament are
Blakley, Forrester, Rozear, Ron-
nie Lewis, Bob Barranger, and
Dick Levy. These boys, with
the aid of Jim Young and Joe
Burdette, regular season firers
who were not able to make the
tournament, compiled a seasonal
record of 20-23.

There were several individ-
val honors earned by the
the sharpshooters. Blakley
was second highest scorer at
the tourney, with scores of
285 both days, and also turned
in the second highest standing
score. Rozear and Levy were
awarded medals for best and
second best prone targets,
respectively. Also, three team
members, Biakley, Forrester,
and Rorear, were selected to
the All-State squad.

Weak hitting and sparodic
fielding has thus far plagued
the ‘Cat squad. On the spring
trip the ‘Cats lost to Georgia

Golfers Troubled

By Inexperience

BY CHARLIE SHAPARD
Sports Staff Writer

In a tri-match at Gastonia last Friday, the Davidson
College golfers fell to both Ohio University and Wake
re teams by scores of 1742-% and 1614-114, respec-

vely.

Against the Ohio team, Frank
McPhillips was the only Wild-
eat to score. In the Wake Forest
match, MePhillips received some
help from Bob Bost who added
a point for the Davidson total.

During the spring holidays,
the 'Cat golfers were downed by
The Citadel, Wofford, and Pres-
byterian. Against the Blue Hose,
McPhillips, Bost, Haywood
Evans, and Mims Rogers tallied

much better if Davidson had
its own course. Also, he feels
that he is hurt by the inex-
perience of the team this year.
“We lack the consistent golf-
ers that we have had in the
past,” the Athletic Director
explained, “however our boys
should improve enough to
make a good showing at the
Conference Tournament at
the Dunes Club in Myrtle
Beach, S. C. on May 8 and 9.”

The next match for the var-
sity is with Wake Forest at
Winston-Salem on April 16,
