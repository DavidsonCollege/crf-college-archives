In Asheville’s Who’s Who

Rev. R. P. Smith, D.D., ’°73, Has
Made Tremendous Contribution
to Western North Carolina

Last December, The Asheville (N. C.)
Times conducted a series of articles on
“Who's Who in Asheville” and among those
listed with a lengthy personal write-up was
Rev. R. P. Smith, D.D., graduate of David-
son College in the class of 1873. It was a
glowing tribute to one who has contributed
immeasurably to the life of Western North
Carolina and is reproduced, in part, below:

Few educators have ben responsible for as
much educational progress in any section as
has Rey. Robert Perry Smith, 78 years old
evangelist of the Presbyterian Church and
for almost thirty years superintendent of
home mission work in this section. For
Doctor Smith has been responsible during
his 33 years of service in this section for
the founding of the Mountain Orphanage
caring for sixty children at Swannanoa, for
the establishment of 32 mission schools, most
of which have become state and county
schools, and for the erection of forty church

and school buildings, debt free. Doctor Smith
has been superintendent of eleven mountain
counties and under his administration seven
thousand persons have affiliated themselves
with the church. Offerings for benevolent
purposes have increased 500 per cent, and
14 churches were organized.

Doctor Smith was born March 24, 1851, in
Spartanburg county, South Carolina. He was
left an orphan at twelve ‘years old. His
father had been a ruling elder, as had his
grandfather, so the boy was assisted in
obtaining an education by his teacher and
his Sunday school superintendent. After two
years of preparatory study he entered David-
son college, where he graduated with the
A.M, and A.B, degrees in 1873.

He then taught for one year at the Reids-
ville Male Academy, at Reidsville, S. C.,
before studying theology at the Columbia
Seminary at Columbia, S. C. His eyes pre-
vented study for awhile so he left the Semi-
nary to accept the presidency of the Reids-
ville Female Academy, where he remained
for nine years. He then became president of
the Presbyterian college at Clinton, S. C.

In 1887 Doctor Smith resigned the presi-
dency of the college, and accepted the pas-
torate of the church at Bullock’s Creek and
Mount Pleasant. From 1890 to 1893 Doctor
Smith served as pastor of the Blackstock
church. In 1893 he became pastor of the
Presbyterian church at Gastonia, where he
remained until 1896, when he came to Ashe-
ville as evangelist and superintendent of
home missions of 11 mountain counties.

From then until 1924, when he retired
from active service on account of failing eye-
sight, Doctor Smith was active superin-
tendent. From 1905 to 1909 he served as
superintendent of home mission of the Synod
of North Carolina. When he -offered his
resignation. Doctor Smith was elected
“superintendent emeritus and advisor and
treasurer of the committee at the same sal-
ary” by the Presbytery.

Perhaps Doctor Smith’s most valuable,
certainly his favorite accomplishment in this
work, is the Mountain Orphanage which be-
gan in 1904 with a modest little four room
cottage, which accommodated a matron and
six children. The home now accommodates
‘sixty children. Most of the four hundred

children who haye gone out from the home] «i

have made excellent and respected men and
women. SaaS

The schools begun by Doctor Smith were
‘established as mission schools in isolated

Personal Notes

W. B. Garrison, ’20, and Mrs. Garrison,
of Charlotte, announce the birth of a son,
W. Barnette, Jr., on January 9,

E. P. O'Connor, ’26, and Mrs. O’Connor,
of Charlotte, announce the birth of a son,
Kent Coleburn, on January 1st. Mr. O’Con-
nor wrote that the physician had said the
baby had the “biggest pair of shoulders he
has ever seen on a youngster,” and as a per-
sonal statement he added, “I’m hoping some
day he can put them in a red and black jer-
sey and rip open holes in a Carolina line
big enough to drive a twenty-mule team
through.” (Can’t be did, brother—Parker)

It was announced last week that twins
were born to Rey. J. Lee Mclean, ’24, and
Mrs. McLean in December. A« card, how-
ever, corrected this by stating they arrived
on October 28. The young man is named
John Lee, Jr., and the young lady, Elizabeth
Anne.

Dr. Rae H. 134

Morris, has begun an

coves and» in communities where the people
were too poor to hire a teacher and where
the state did not send a teacher. Most of the
teaching was done by volunteers who gave
three and four months each summer to the
task of establishing classes. Often the par-
ents, unable themselves to read or write,
attended with their children. Later the
schools were turned over to the state as the
public school program was expanded to the
poorer mountain counties.

Doctor Smith is enormously interested in
the natives of Appalachia. “The mountain
people are the finest on earth,” he said,
“They have their own code and follow it,
and their hospitality is unexcelled. I have
traveled considerably in Europe and else-
where and I believe that in native intelligence
they outrank other strains. They may be
illiterate, but they have brains.” Dr. Smith
is writing a book about his work among the
mountaineers.

Cormick,

the volume, which is entitled, ‘North Car-
olina Practice and Procedure in Civil
