THE DAVIDSONIAN, NOVEMBER 12, 1920.

An Item of information.

cher it’s so.” .

Always on the Job..

The Davidson Volunteer Fire Depart-
ment had a busy day Saturday. Even
the smallest blaze was given prompt and
expert attention. The entire depart-
ment deserves commendation for the way
it has always handled any fire which ap-
peared on the campus. Are you doing
your bit?

Personal.

It’s a good policy to always keep your
eyes and ears open but your mouth
should be closed at least part of the
time. .

Ode to “Bobbie.”*
*(Author of Exercising Ole Taurus,)
He slings the Bull into the air,
It fall to earth, he knows not where.

Help!
Snag—“What's a good sign for rain
weather?” ;
Bugs—“Bullfrogs croaking.”
Snag—“But isn’t there some other
sign that I could distinguish from Law-
son blowing his bass horn?”

Hee-Haw.
Casseli—“What did you say, Carl?”
Matthews—“Nothing.”

Cassell—“I know, but how did you ex-
press it?”

Do It?
We wonder if the cotton we see these
days calls up any associations to the
Upper-classmen.

Rumor.

We hear that J. Eris lost his cap at
Cornelius the other night. We wonder
if this wasn't just a frame-up so ‘he
could return.

No, Please Don‘t.
“Don’t worry yourself about your
good-looks, Mr. Kiser.”

Gloom.

The Mississippi-Alabama picture was
being taken. “Close your mouths and
look happy.” said the photographer. A.
P. Ormand registers a frown—he can’t
be happy with his mouth shut.

Horsed.

Windy, to old colored man—“Say
uncle, how far is it down the road a lit-

We usta wonder what the newspapers
write about when the war was over.
Now we wonder what they will write
about since the election is over.

Burney—"Yes, sir!”

Burney—"By experience, sir.”

An Open Letter.

Thanks Miss V. S. for the compliment.
The Peanut Parcher also appreciated
your Thanksgiving wish and takes this

Pleasant Easter and Happy Fourth of

It’s about time to begin falling out

Tucker—“You have plenty of chances

A fellow from Charlotte said he had
just had a beaf stew and felt bully. Some
one from one of the neighboring eating
establishments said he had just had a
week-end stew and felt like everything.

You tell ’em Stork, you kid the world.

Bashful.
Fresh—“Do you know why leaves turn
red at this time of the year?”
Soph—“No, why?”
Fresh—“They blush with shame to
think that their limbs will soon be bare.”

Essay on Man.
(By David.) *

Man is an omnivorous animal. Some
smart people call him biped; but we call
him a plain, every-day, two-legged
animal. Like other beasts, he roams at
night, and feeds in daylight. Some
nights he is very tame, so that he could
be touched anywhere except on the
pocket-book. He has, under such con-
ditions been known to kick like a mule.
Like the rooster, a man crows every-
time he has accomplished an ordinary
feat. Like the elephant, man has a
trunk, in which each carries his medium
of protection—the elephant, his miscular
strength; the man, his pistol. Man is
like a cow; a cow does not give her
milk,—it has to be taken; a man does
not give his money—it has to be ex-
tracted. Man is so nearly like an
ordinary dumb brute that he is often
pronounced “horsed.” Men are frequent-
ly called beasts, and women are often
called cats. ;

There is only one difference between
man and brute—man lies standing up.

Purty, Please!

voice was “Sock’s.") “Ple-e-ease kiss-

FIRST ISSUE OF 1920-21
MAGAZINE APPEARS

Many Changes and Improvements
Mark This Year’s Publication.

“That's what I call a real magazine.”
“Boy, this is pretty nifty, isn’t it?” These
were some of the remarks heard when
the new Davidson College Magazine
made its appearance last Saturday. The
style of the Magazine has been changed
somewhat from that of former years.
This year it is the size of “Life” and con-
tains twenty-four double-column pages.
The cover design was prepared by J. B.
Mallard, a former Davidson man, and
is one of the most attractive covers
ever used on the Magazine.

The literary standards set in former
years are well-upheld. The current
issue of the Magazine contains two
short stories, five essays, a number of
poems, and several timely editorials.
The editors are to be congratulated in
their endeavors to make the Davidson
College Magazine “the best college
magazine in the South,”
