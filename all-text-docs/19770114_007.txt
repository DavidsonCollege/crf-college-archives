that they are very hard to well
without considerable sponsor
supervision, said Kelton.

Kelton admitted that elimi-
nating Extended. Studies
would restrict the opportuni-
ties of freshmen who come to
Davidson with an intensive
background in some area and
want to pursue it immediately.

“‘I can see how a student
with, say, four or five years of
a language would be capable of
handling an Extended Studies
in the literature of that lang-
uage or some other special
area.

“And without Extended
Studies, the sophomore with a
good grounding in a discipline
would not be able to explore an
area of particular interest to
him.

“But these exceptional stu-
dents don’t receive the atten-
tion they deserve under the
present Extended Studies set
up.”

In psychology, our five
instructors work with five or
six juniors and as many

seniors in independent study

programs—they have that.

many commitments before
even considering Extended
Studies for freshmen or sopho-
mores.

“Extended Studies are an
extra course load for a faculty
member who will naturally
give more careful attention to
majors and their independent

studies work.

“IT haven’t committed my-
self yet, but if I were to vote
now I would go along with a
proposal to restrict Extended
Studies,’’ concluded Kelton.

Professor of English Gil
Holland was in favor of keep-
ing the Extended Studies Pro-
gram. He commented, ‘‘I
think it’s been very successful
myself. I hope they keep it,
mainly because of the writing
in my own case. I’ve had good
luck with students in improv-
ing their expository writing.
Some students have also done
some reading in interest areas
along with their writing.”

Holland also saw the draw-
backs of the Extended Studies
program, ‘‘Some members are
just drowned in independent
study. I think that’s the
problem. We all have other
independent study pro-
grams."

In spite of these disadvan-
tages, Holland said, ‘I'd hate
to see the students lose that
opportunity (Extended Stu-
dies).’’

“T have very limited exper-
ience with Extended Studies,’’
admitted Professor of Religion
Gordon E. Michaelson, ‘‘but
basically I’m in favor of
anything in the curriculum
that provides for student ex-
perimentation, things that
don’t fit neatly into a course.

‘‘A college like this can
afford to be pluralistic in its
academic interest.

“‘I realize there are prob-
lems —my anxiety is simply
over accomodating a wide
variety of student interest.”’

“T am in favor of Extended
Studies —it provides a good

arrangement of options and.

gives us flexibility we would
not otherwise have,’’ said
Professor of Biology Don
Kimmel.

“Students earn biology cre-
dit in Extended Studies just
as they do in the required
Independent Studies program.

“Biology is a research sci-
ence, and we want as many as
we can handle to sign up for
independent research.

‘‘About half the time stu-
dents will do research for a
faculty member. The rest of
the projects the student and
faculty member work up to-
gether.

“Extended and independent
research can provide good
career and experiential oppor-
tunities, like the hospital pro-
gram we have some sopho-
mores in. It also allows pre-
meds to get into depth, gives
them an idea of what research
is like.

“If the faculty. votes to
abolish Extended Studies, our
department would reinstitute
a departmental requirement,
with a different name but the
same purpose, that would give
us the same flexibility.”

Extended Studies, in the
eyes of most freshmen, looms
above as a rather hazy plan for
independent study, something
used to fill a third hole, or in
the face of other demanding
courses, as a good ‘‘balance’’
to save sanity. What many
freshmen do not realize is that
an Extended Study is not an
easy way out, but rather a
viable alternative to the limi-
ted course offerings that come
with a small college.

Something is missing, for
there is a conspicuous lack of
information about what Ex-
tended Studies really are, as
well as, how to plan one, who
to see about it, and what is
involved in exploring areas of
interest that are not offered in
a specific course at Davidson.

Misconceptions range from 7
total ignorance, to thinking Knowing what they envision

that an Extended Study is
taking a regularly offered ‘dies Program are we able

course independently, to the °° look at and achieve from

horrifying thought that one
must decide a major before
being able to take an Exten-
ded Study.

Freshmen are just not told.
In looking back, Extended
Studies are overlooked in the
rush of pre-registration, the
confusion of even thinking of
course requirements, and the
entire process of adjusting to
the joys and tribulations of
first and second term. It is
ignored at orientation, the hall
counselors must only go by
their impressions, and the
college catalog is forgotten in
the shuffle.

Now the EPC is examining
Extended Studies. One of the
arguments against Extended
Studies is that some have
become ‘‘shatty, irresponsible
projects.”” They have not giv-
en us the chance. Although it
is our responsibility to plan
our course schedule, we are
freshmen and need to be told.

In this respect, the faculty
and administration have
failed, for it is only by

Interview

Epes speaks for Extended Studies

Davidsonian: When did you first assume the
position of director of Extended Studies?

Epes: Two and a half years ago, after the Extended
Studies Program became optional.

D: How were you chosen for the position?

E: It was an accident. Dr. Bevan was sorry to do-it.
Knowing he would not have the time for it I
volunteered. At the time I thought it would be for
only six months.

D: Why do you think Davidson needs it?

E: It provides some opportunities that I don’t think ©

would be otherwise available. Some of the things it
does could be provided for through the departments.
It is also psychologically useful to know that the
routine of three classes can be broken.

D: If handled by the departments would be
independent studies.

E: I assume so.

D: What do you look for in an Extended Studies
project?

E: What I like to see most is something different,
something substantial, and most of all, something
interesting.

D: Why would you turn down a project?

E: I rarely have that option. The area chairmen do
that.

D: What would the reasons be for rejecting a
project?

E: There are two chief reasons. One would be
weaknesses in the evaluation procedure and the
second would be something that appears, at least on
the surface, to be frivolous. .

D: Can you tell after the effect when a project has
been accepted but should not have been?

E: Not always, of course. But I do get feedback from
a sponsor. Occasionally I get feedback from other
students. I depend on the “Rumor Mill’. I’m in the

c

position to know better than anybody.

D: Why are you in that position?

E: I see all the contracts; I talk to the area chairmen.
And I’m sufficiently-associated with the program to
hear the rumors.

D: I have heard three oppositions to the program.
The first is financial. How do you answer this
opposition?

E: Both Dean Johnston and I agree that finances is
simply not a major point of opposition.

D: The ggcond argument is that the program takes
up too much faculty time.

E: It’s asserted that to do the program right
requires a fair amount of time. I agree. I don’t think
it takes as much time as some people believe. After
all, the work should be mainly independent work on
the student’s part. My reservation is, to use
economic terms, what’s the trade-off? If we save
that time for what else will it be used for?

D: Can you think of a way to alleviate some of the
burden of time?

E: One way that would help would be to put a ceiling
of three projects a year on every faculty member and
enforce it. That ceiling would, oddly enough, allow
us to operate at the level we operated last year.

D: The last argument is that some of the past
Extended Studies Programs have been shoddy.

E: Sometimes it is and sometimes it isn’t)when it is
good I think it is excellent. Moreover I don’t think
Extended Studies has a patent on shoddy or
excellent work. I think, however, the spread
between shoddy and excellent is greater.

D: But you think the good outweighs the bad?

E: Yes. And I would include among the good the

opportunity to do something outside the classroom.
Students can do this in seminars but Extended
Studies assures the opportunity for everyone.

D: What do you see as the directions which

Extended Studies might take?

E: I foresee two options. We could keep it or we
could get rid of it. In the later case I can see one
alternative: the assurance that each department
offers independent study for members of each of the
four classes.

D: Why would that option be less desirable than the
present program of Extended Studies?

E: A department would almost necessarily tend to
give preference to majors, I think: The second
reservation to have is that when we put everything
in departmental pigeon holes we miss a lot of stuff
that falls in between the cracks. And let me add one
advantage to the option. Extended Studies as it
stands is open only to freshmen and sophomores.
This option would open the concept to juniors and
seniors.

D: What about the other direction? What will
happen to the quality of education if Extended
Studies is abolished?

E: The school would survive. It just wouldn’t be
quite the same.

D: We've talked about what the students gain from
the program. What do the faculty members stand to
gain from it if anyone?

E: I think in some cases the faculty dove-tails
Extended Studies projects into their own research.
Of course the same thing happens in departmental
independent studies as well. There are times I've
seen a faculty member sponsor project which they
know only a litle about but want to find out more.
‘That’s fun for me to see. there are lists of projects
that they are not only willing to do but really want
to.

D: Have you any other comment on the subject?
E: Only to say that we know it’s a high riseQ program
and I’m willing to take the risks.
