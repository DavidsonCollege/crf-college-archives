Finishing a tremendous regular season, the Wildcats fight until the end during the
final game of the Southern Conference against University of Tennessee at

Chattanooga. As number two in the conference, Davidson still hopes for a
tournament bid.

Wildcats’
gasp falls short

By Will Cobb

Basketball is a game of inches, and
when Brandon Williams’ jumper bounced
off the rim and into the hands of a UT-C
player last night, Davidson’s quest for the
conference championship ended. It was that
close, a simple matter of inches. Of the
seven current losses on the season this one
will always be the most remembered, and
the most bitter.

In a weekend that featured several tight
games, the final figured to be just as tight.
The two teams waged war and there would
be no easy way to lose. Unfortunately the
ball bounced in favor of the Moccasins, and
Davidson will have to wait to see where and
when their next game will be. At 22-7, the
Wildcats make a strong case for post-season
play in the NCAA and the NIT. Now all we
can do is wait.

The Cats came to Asheville ready to
play this past weekend, expecting nothing
less than to win.

On Friday, Davidson squared off against
a VMI squad that had come off a big win
over Marshall, stealing the thunder from the

: Herd in a.84-62 rout. Davidson would win

71-61, but that win would not be one of the
prettier ones we’ve had this season. The
Cats got down early by 7 before getting a
wake up call, but by the 9-minute mark,
Davidson took a 14-13 lead and never let go.

Amidst the team’s poorest shooting perfof~
mance of the year at 38.9%, Janko Narat led
the way with 20 points and six rebounds.
Quin Harwood came off the bench big,
scoring 12 points while grabbing nine re-
bounds.

Though the game was tighter than ex-
pected, Davidson maintained in control.
They out-rebounded the Knights 45-32. The
key came with 10:10 remaining when the
Cats were able to make an 8-0 rin, what
proved to secure the win.

“We were very fortunate to be victori-
ous tonight [Friday]. We were expected to
win and had fight playing not to lose,” said
Coach McKillop.

The Cats would then face Western Caro-
lina University, a 79-78 upset winner over
ETSU behind a three- pointer with seven
seconds remaining.

Davidson broke out of the gate and
raced to a 17- point halftime lead behind
sophomore Brandon Williams, who simply
could not miss, scoring 24 on 8-11 shooting
from the field. The Cats shot 68% from the
floor and 82% from the line to create a 52-35

The Catamounts weren *tthrough, how-
ever, proving no lead is too safe.. Davidson
had a 20-point advantage with 12:15 re-

Shortage of tourney tickets after 200 sold to ETSU

By Carrie Blackburn

Two hundred East Tennessee
State University basketball fans
occupied the seats of Wildcat fans
this weekend at the Southern Con-
ference Basketball Tournament.
The Baker Ticket Office, afraid of
having to eat the cost of left-over
tickets, sold 200 of Davidson’s 400
tickets to ETSU last fall.

Each Southern Conference
school is allotted 400 ticket book-

lets for the conference tournament
at $55 per booklet. Last year,
Davidson was only able to sell 30
of its 400 booklets and had to pay
for the rest. “We lost a lot of
money,” says Becky Ervin, Direc-
tor of Game Management.

The school’s losses on ticket
sales were exacerbated by the fact
that the school is required to pro-
vide $5000 worth of complimen-
tary tickets to its players and work-

ers, putting the school in debt be-
fore ticket sales even started. Ac-
cording to Athletic Ticket Man-
ager Lee Sargent, “It’s a losing
proposition.”

The school hoped to avoid re-
peating such a loss this year and
eagerly sold the 200 ticket pack-
ages when ETSU expressed inter-

est. Sargent says the seats sold to"

ETSU “were downstairs where you
couldn’t see anyway.”

Committee searches for

By Court McBryde

As the Search Committee for
Davidson’s new Dean of Students
continues to narrow its list of pro-
spective candidates, the end of
the search comes into sight.

Mathematics professor Dr.
Bruce Jackson serves as chair-
man of the committee, which is
composed of four students, three
professors, one administrator, and
one coach: juniors Eric
Rosenbach and Sarah Orsbon, se-
niors Julie Petty and Devane
Tidwell, Dr. Vivien Dietz, Dr.

Julio Ramirez, Dr. Janet Shan-
non, Asst. Director to Annual
Fund Lisa Combs, and Coach Jeff
Frank.

Jackson said that the Search
Committee is in the process of
narrowing the list of candidates.
The committee has been busy in
trying to find more information
on those candidates it favors.

Jackson said neither names
nor numbers of candidates for
this position can be released be-
cause Davidson College prom-
ised all candidates they would be

new Dean

treated with confidentiality.

However, Jackson said, “We
are aiming to bring candidates to
campus the week adjacent to spring
vacation, and we are looking for-
ward to getting the students! and
the college's input.”

The Search Committee has
dedicated countless hours to its
search for anew Dean. "Ithas been
alot of work—but interesting. Itis
avery qualified group of appli-
cants, and we should feel assured
that we’re in good hands,” said
Rosenbach.

Before the extent of the Wild-
cats’ success became apparent,
Terry Holland planned to increase
ticket sales and generate student
interest in this year’s tournament
by making students a deal. The
school offered students a package
for up to 3 games at the reduced
price of $15. The college paid the
difference in the cost of $40 and
reserved the right to cut some of its
losses, if necessary, by selling to

other schools the tickets to the
games in which Davidson did not
play.

The Wildcats’ extraordinary
performance this year caught the
administration by surprise. The
200 ticket booklets, especially with
some going at the at the reduced
rate of $15, proved to be insuffi-
cient to satisfy the demand. The
