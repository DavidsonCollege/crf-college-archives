One final story concerning the
Medical School .and Davidson -is
sull to be unfolded. Foe many years
tife student body at Davidson has
had some vague ideas about an
X-ray being taken at.the so-called
“Davidson -Medical School.” The

Davidson, and, offered much in-

teresting speculating for small

boys. a! _
In 1889 Dr. J. P. Monroe re-

placed Dr. Barringer, who had ac-
cepted a post at the University of
Virginia. Dr. Monroe ,bdught Dr.

-Barringer:s—interest—in-the ‘tutorial’

school, which was generally known
as the Medical Preparation School,
and immediately established , the
school on broader lines. Thus, the
school opened its doors in 1890
with a faculty of four’ men. Con-
tinued growth of the school from
1890 to 1893 led to the acquirement

of more buildings, the incorporation ‘to this version Dr. Henry Lewis
. ad

truth of the story is, in reality ob-
scure; Since there are- two different
variations on the same tale.

One story has it that upon Sun-
day night of January the 12 1896,

enientes of plivsies, who_vow ‘ives
in the bailding “Tonal occupied
by the Medical Schdol,_and . who
taught. students of both imstutions,
states that, in his opinion, the fol-
lowing is The Teuth-eot The matter:
‘he first N-ray ever taken in the
United States was that “which was
taken by the three students. This
Ntray—was taken in the college
physics laboratory and was a pic-
ture ‘of a cadavet’s hand whieh was
tilthed from) the medical school:
Some litue time Jater, Dr. Smith,
who ‘had been conducting experi-
nents with the N-ray, was asked
by the medica! school to make an
A-Tay 10 determine. whether a
young gif? in Contord had swal-
lowed a tailor’s thimble, which she
claimed she had done. As the ulti-
mate result of this X-ray, the
thimble was discovered to be lodged
in the girl's trached, and it: was
subsequently removed by an opera-
tion performed in Charlotte. Thig
X-ray, according to Dr. Douglas,

three Davidson College stadents,
one of them Osman Varringer now
living in, Charlotte, broke into the
college physics faboratory and pro-
ceeded to make the first X-ray pic-
ture ever taken in the United
States.

There is, however, as mentioned
before, a second story, According

wasiiet the ‘fiest to fe-taken ti
the United States, but was the first
one taken in the United States with
an avowed medical purpose.

Thus closes an interesting but
almost forgotten chapter of the his-
tory of Davidson and the adjacent
North Carolina Medical Coilege

this college community.
