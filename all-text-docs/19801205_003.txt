Two dorms and Commons
will be ready in September

By JENNY O’BRIANT
Staff Writer

The two new dorms and the
Dining Commons will open as
scheduled in September 1981
The buildings may be complete
by this summer.

One dorm will probably be
all-male and the other co-ed,
according to Housing Director
Bill Bolding.

The Commons will replace
Richards and Bailey houses as
the main dining facility on
campus. Richards will be relo-
cated between Rusk and PAX
and Bailey between ETC and
Fannie and Mabel’s. ;

Physical Plant Director Gro-
ver Meetze said Richards and
Bailey will not be moved until
the Commons is finished.

The new dorms are designed
to provide housing variety, with
carpeted halls and modern furn-
ishings, Bolding said.

Dean of Students Will Terry
and Bolding have already
chosen the color scheme for the
dorms. Bolding said he will
order mattresses and furnish-
ings in the next week or two.

Once the new dorms are
complete, Center Duke may be

reserved for women only, Bold-
ing said. This would compen-

- sate for the lack of single rooms

available on campus to women.

There are now only four such

rooms.
Under this arrangement, two

students instead of three would ©

live in the two-room suites in
Center Duke.

WDAV raising funds

WDAYV is now in the midst of its second .annual fundraising
drive, with a goal of $35,000. The seven day drive ends Sunday.

As of 4:30 Wednesday, the station had collected $9,175 from 343
contributors, station Community Relations Director Henry Doss

said.

WDAV’s operating budget is $112,000 for fiscal year 80-81, of
which $50,000 is given by the college, Doss said.

The remainder of WDAV’s $62,000 share should come from
regular membership renewals, Doss said. The station plans to
concentrate later this year on increasing corporate support.

WDAV has also recently received an FCC license for a new
transmitter tower. The new tower, which Doss said will be
operational ‘‘within a few months,”’ will be 48 feet higher than the
old one and 6 miles closer to Charlotte, giving WDAV a much
clearer signal in the city. In addition, it will increase the station’s
signal strength from 18,500 to 20,000 watts.

Debaters win

Davidson debaters won six trophies and the Sweepstakes prize
for best overall showing at the Appalachian Mountain

speaker of the tournament while Ervin ‘tied for second.

In a new category, cross examinational debate, sophomores
Sherburne Laughlin and Tracy Thompson posted a 5-1 record,
losing only in the semi-finals. Thompson won second speaker
in the division.

« Freshmen Mary Fant and Jim Morgan achieved a 4-2
record i in the traditional category.

Charlotte developer gets Town’s OK

By CATHEY BOST
Staff Writer

The Davidson Town Board
has given Synco, Inc., a Char-
lotte-based developer, a Special
Use permit to begin construc-
tion of a housing development.

The permit granted at the
Boards’ November 10
allows Synco to build 20 houses
on a lakefront tract of land off of
Griffith Street, the road leading
to I-77.

The Board granted the permit
with ten conditions. According
to Mayor Nancy MacCormac,
these include requirements for
Synco to specify the date of
completion of the project, to

‘ . abide by all town subdivision

ordinances, to prohibit’ the con-
struction of ‘private’ docks, and
to incorporate any limitations
on boat horsepower established
by the town into the Home-
owner Association’ s regula-
tions.

Synco may only build 20

houses because that is the -
. maximum the sewer line at

Griffith Street can now handle,
MacCormac added.

Synco had no objections to
the Board’s ruling, MacCormac

said, but did request legal
clarification of the requirement
to specify dates of completion.
Town Attorney Richard Kline
will report on the condition at
the Board meeting next Tues-
day.

Synco Project Officer John
Yelverton was not available for
comment. Last month he told
The Davidsonian Synco would
begin construction ‘‘as soon as

possible” after the issuance of a.

permit. 7
North Carolina Water Skiing

School owner Russ. Debuc, .

whose school is located across
the lake from the dev. ment
site, submitted a al to
the Board to limit horsepower of
boats only on the d¢velopment
side of the lake. This would
allow the school to continue to
operate ifs high-powered water-
ski boats on its side of the lake.
MacCormac said there has been

«no discussion of Debuc’s propo-

sal, Debué:refused to, comment

‘:on the Board's decision.

There : ‘still remain’ a few

‘unresolved questions about the

development, MacCormac said.
The first is the question of

public versus private streets.
Next Tuesday’s meeting will
include a public hearing on
revising the town’s Subdivision
ordinances to allow for the
waiver of some construction
requirements in the case of
roads within a subdivision.

If the ordinances are revised,
MacCormac said, Synco may
build narrower, curbless roads,
as it had originally planned.

The second is the question of
whether the town has jurisdic-
tion over use of the lake. While
the town, as a partner to the
development’s.. Homeowner
Association, may regulate the
land use requirements estab-
lished by the association, .legis-
lation and enforcement of water
use restrictions is not delegated
to any official body, MacCor-
mac explained.

Establishing such jurisdic-
tion will involve ‘clarification
at the state legislative level,”
MacCormac said, and could
take a year. “It is an interesting
legal question, with no direct,
easy answers,” she said, which
will ‘‘require additional legal
and political activity.”
