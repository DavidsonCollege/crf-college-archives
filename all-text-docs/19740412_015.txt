GET IT OVER

IMAC volleyball action is still going strong despite a rash of
forfeits. New realignment procedures will be soon instituted by
President Bryan Andrews.

veritable Mecca of the sports world. Instead. we
have the Checkers and sometimes the Cougars. Big
time for sure!

Maybe it’s selfish of me, but somehow I can't
imagine Csonka, Kiick and Warfield with ‘‘Charlot-
te’’ across their chests. Kind of like Frank Sinatra
playing the Rathskeller.

We salute Bill Reed as the new Davidson wildcat
and bid Dave Bender a fond farewell. He has been
an institution in himself for three years.

Also, why a female mascot? Is that not tokenism
at its worst? There are thousands of coed schools
across the nation, but only Davidson was so bush as
to invent a Miss Kitty. How about one mascot,
either male or female?

And another thing - why not present Bender with
the Wildcat head he’s now worn for three years? It
is beat up and need to be replaced anyway. The
cost of replacing it is slim indeed when compared
to the amount of free publicity and spirit Dave
brought to Davidson.

Bender followed the team (often at his own ex-

pense) around the country, giving up vacations,
study time, and free time. Never has a Davidson
