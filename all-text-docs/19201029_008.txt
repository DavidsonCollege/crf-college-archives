ADVANCE DOPE ON CITADEL

Bulldogs Present Strong Line-up for
Saturday’s Fray.

Davidson Wildcats meet The Citadel
Cadets on Wearn Field in ‘Charlotte
next Saturday in a game that promises
to be full of strategy and hard fighting.

Like the Wildcats, thae Cadets have
been meeting some of their hardest op-
ponents carly in the season. V. M. L
walked off with their scalp to the tune
of 35 and o, and Furman by a score of
21 to 6 This does not mean that our
sailing Saturday will be casy, however.
as V. M. IL. is putting out one of the
South's best machines this year and
Furman is playing stellar ball, which
facts help to account for Citadel's losses.
The'Cadets came hack strong last Satur-
day and defeated Wofford, 19 to o in a
game in which they assumed the offen-
sive. Their line-up for Saturday will
probably be Lee, R. E., Grambling, R. T.,
.7.; Heinsohn, ‘L. T.; Whittaker, L. E.;
Jeter, R. T., Marshall, Center, Eude, L
post. Q. B.; Wulbert, R. H. B.; Kollock,

. H. B.; Jarvis, F. B.

Davidson having a good start on the
ypward path due to her recent victories
over Wake Forest and the University of
Richmond, is out for blood and new
honors. Comparitive scores fail us in
this game as the two schedules have not
yet crossed. However, our chances
seem to be about equal, due to the fact
that Citadel plays under S. I. A. A.
rulings which will throw out for David-
son, Schenck, Poe, and Moore. The men
who will probably appear in the Red
are N. Shepard, W.
Shepherd, Massey, MclFadden,
and Dick.

Morning ky you, Getz!

Who Crossed,
