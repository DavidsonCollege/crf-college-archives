Optimistic and young are
probably the adjectives that
best describe this year’s David-
son baseball team. The optim-
ism is firmly based on several
aspects including the success of
Davidson’s first fall season, the
return of leading hitter John
Porter and top pitcher Jon
Young from last year’s squad,
and the addition of some very
talented freshmen who must fill
several key positions vacated
by graduation.

Junior Cam Zurbruegg com-
mented, “‘This year’s team has
an attitude different from any
other team that I’ve played on
at Davidson in the respect that
we feel we can play with the
best teams in the South and
beat them.”’

The team is young in the
sense that the Wildcats have no
seniors on the squad. Concern-
ing what most people would

B&BBtalk straight about spring IMAC

By BONEHEAD and

THE BRICK BROTHERS

Congratulations on your re-
turn to another episode of
Bonehead and the Brick Bro-
thers. This term we promise to
report accurately and in depth
on the intramural sports and
once again we refuse to write on
seemingly unrelated events
even though this is a liberal arts
institution in which each stu-
dent must fulfill certain area
requirements, including the
equivalent of a year in a foreign
language. Right, Charlie? And
now for the spring preview.

IMAC czar Sterling Martin
rode over to. Bonehead’s pad to
ask that. we report the drop-add
procedure for spring softball. It
has been decided by the Admin-
istration that in the past there
have been too many games on
the softball fields and this is
leading to damaged grass. The
damage to the grass presents
many problems. Alumni week-
end is next month and the
campus needs to be in top
condition. This includes green
grass on the intramural fields.

A ceiling has been set at three

games per week on fields one, .

two, and three, and the remain-

ing fields will accomodate six
games every two weeks. Fields
one and two are restricted to
juniors and seniors. The excep-
tion to this rule is that a
sophomore team may sign up if
it has a player who was all-state
on his high school baseball team
or has three players of Cuban
descent. Field 6 is open only to
members of ATO and women
faculty teams. Field:4 is open to
teams with an average height of
6 feet 4 inches and permission
must be granted by a nurse in
the infirmary.

There was some discussion
that with the limited number of
games that can be played and
the restrictions placed on the
teams that some. students may
not be able to get enough
playing time in. Dick Burts

assured his comrades that since
each student is here for four
years that there should be little
difficulty in satisfying one of
the team sport requirements.
He explained that with students
going to Europe in the Spring
there were actually very few
students left on campus and
said everyone would eventually
get a chance to play.

There was some confusion as
to how the registration of teams
would be accomplished. We will
explain this to the best of our
ability but freshmen may wish
to consult their hall counselors.

The last week of each term
teams will turn in rosters to
P.O. Box 6, Davidson. Each
roster will be assigned a code
word. The rosters will then be

consider a rebuilding year, as
bruegg states, ‘‘that we feel
we've already rebuilt due to the
experience gained during the
fall games.”

The Cats’ youth is eounter-
balanced by the fact that six
starters are returning from last
year's team. These include out-
fielders Allen Griffith, John
Haskell, and all-Southern Con-
ference centerfielder John
Porter. Returning starters in
the infield Cam Zurbruegg and
Joby Merton are captains this
year and Earl Ransom again
fills the designated hitter post.

New starters include first
baseman Blaine Sanders, sec-
ond baseman Jeff Ray, and
freshman catcher Phillip Gor-
don. Pitching will be a key
factor in determining whether
the Wildcats can challenge for
the Southern Conference crown.
Top Cat pitchers include Jon
Young, Rusty Colechia, John
Marshall, and Diggs Bishop.

An improved pitching corps
is one of the major factors in the
optimistic attitude exhibited by
the team. Such optimism was
well based as Cats got off to a
good start by beating confer-
ence rival Virginia Tech 4-1
behind Jon Young’s mound per-
formance. The Wildcats then
made a trip to Florida over
spring break where they played
six games. Davidson pulled a
big upset by defeating South-
eastern Conference powerhouse
Vanderbilt 3-2-as sophomore
Diggs Bishop pitched a com-
plete game.

The Wildcats then lost four in
a row to Rollins and Vanderbilt
before getting back on track
and beating Central Florida 8-5
as John Marshall had three hits
to pace Davidson’s offensive
attack. Tuesday afternoon Da-
vidson evened its record at 4-4
with a 13-5 win over Wofford.

Rifle team ends season with disappointment

The Cat riflemen ended their.

regular season with a record of
15-8. This has been a rebuilding
year for the team and conse-
quently scores were often not
what they could have been.

As winter term drew to a
close the rifle team began to

prepare for the championships
of the two conferences in which
it participates. Practice went
well with the team posting some
of its highest scores. However,
when match time came around
the Boston Strangler choked a
few people badly.

The first championship was
in the Western Carolina Confer-
ence. Pat Stuart paced the Cats
with a subpar performance; for
the second year in a row he shot
poorly in tournament competi-
tion.

The Cats did manage to take

the few bright spots of the
match; Robbie Kirkendol. The
red-headed senior was high

wher: their contribution will be

in the much tougher Southern
Conference. The team traveled
over the mountains to East
Tennessee State University for
this match. As expected ETSU
took first place beating the
closest competition by almost
200 points. The Cats came in a
disappointing fifth, losing

fourth place to the Citadel by 2
points. Once again Robbie Kir-
kendol led the team but every-
one else fired subpar scores.

In spite of low performances

It will be tough to replace
seniors John Parham and Rob-
bie Kirkendol, but hopefully
under the guidance of Sgt.
Ransom Cooper and

It is no surprise that David-
son's swimmers finished third
in the conference meet held
February 22nd & 23rd; what
might be a surprise is that four

Davidson swimmers were

named ‘All-Conference.’
Finger, who placed third in the
200..fly and. set new school
records in the 100 fly and 200
IM. Warren Beck, also named
“All Conference,” placed third
and set school records in both
the 200 backstroke and the 200
freestyle.

Another ‘‘All Conference’’

swimmer, Mike Schremmer, ,

placed third in the 1650 free and
also set a new school record in

this event. The school record in .

the 400 IM medley was also
shattered as ‘Beck, Finger, Rid-
dle, and Allen placed third.
Beck, Finger, Allen, and
Schremmer combined to placed
third in the 400 free relay,
breaking the, school record in
that event as well. Also named
‘All-Conference’ were divers
George Bright and Charu Shar-
ma.

Davidson's only conference
champ was senior Mark Tom-
merdahl, who placed first in the
400'IM. By placing third in the
500 free and second in the 200.
fly, Tommerdahl joined the
ranks of Davidson’s ‘All-Con-
ference” swimmers. Swimming
in conference meets is nothing
new to Tommerdahl: he was
conference champion last year
in the 400 IM. Many have
praised Tommerdah! as being
