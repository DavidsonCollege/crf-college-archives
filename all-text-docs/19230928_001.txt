Hall on Idealism

LARGE AUDIENCE PRESENT

President Martin Introduces Speak-
er to Davidson Audience

On Tuesday night, September 18th,
the college and the people of Davidson
had the pleasure of hearing Dr. Edwin
Mins lecture on the subject, The Fight
for Idealism in America. Dr. Mims
has heen the head of the E inglish de-
partment of Vanderbilt University
since 1912, Previous to this time he
had held professor ships in the English
departments of Trinity College and the
University of North Carolina. He
has taught at a number of collegiate

summer schools, and as an author and
lecturer he holds & high position in|
literary circles. Dr. Mims was intro-
duced to the audience by President
Martin, and after a short word of
greeting the speaker of the evening
proceeded with his lecture.

The lecture, in part, was as follows:
“It appears to me that there are two
well-defined points of vie win contem- |
porary thought and that there is an|
irrepressible conflict hetween these two |
points of view; on the one hand, We |
have worldliness, indifference, mate-
rialism, determinism, pessimism and |
cynicism; on the other, we haxe seri-

Professor Archie Currie
inspirational speaker at the Y. M.
vesper service Sunday evening. Tak-
ing as the scripture lesson Joshua
6:1-20, the account of the fall of Jeri-
cho, Professor Currie brought home in
a practical way the lesson to be learned
from the Israelites besieging the walls
of the citv. He showed in a forcible
manner the harmful effects that come
from knocking,

“The Israelites,” said the speaker in
opening, “although differing externally
were essentially the same as we are to-
day. They were a stiff-necked people,
always complaining, and determined to
have their own way. There were peo-
ple then, as there are now, who knew

more about the government than those ;

in charge, and ‘these people were al-

ways knocking the administration.
“Jericho was shut up, so that none

could come in or go out of the city, be-

cause the people of Jericho had been |

‘filled with a sort of superstitious fear

of the Israelites. God had performed

miracles and had ofttimes delivered the

vice-president as successor to Mc-|
Bryde, who resigned a short time ago. |
As head of the personal work commit-
tee, McLean will. gladly discuss with
any student his life’s work.

The cabinet has changed the time of |
the weekly Bible study classes from|
9:30 Wednesday evening to 10 o'clock |
Sunday morning. A careful selection |
of teachers has been made by Eugene
Regen, who is in charge of the Bible
study. There will be a class organized
on each flooy in every dormitory. If
the text-books arrive this week the first
meetings are to be held next Sabbath.

McBryde’s work on the deputations
committee of the cabinet is taken over
by Henry White, who expects to send

a great many men on “Y” deputations | «

to nearby towns.

Opportunities presented for good
work in our own community will not
be neglected. Marion Murray is to
lead the work among the boys of the
town. A part of the program con-

opening of the session. The quota of

25 men an afternoon was quickly filled |

and a waiting list was prepared. The

steadily for four hours each afternoon
since, until the Saturday of
the Elon football game. Since then,
the financial managers of the contract-
ing parties have been kept busy trans-
ferring the dollars from the coffers of
the one to the pockets of the other.

The work was done by the sutdents
not so much for the financial gain and
the exercise tobe derived from it,
more in the spirit of helpfulness, and
the desire to see a splendid atheltic
field at Davidson College.

Scene Removed to Cornelius on Ac-
count of Rain on Richardson Field
The life blood of the Tlon boys
which was to have christened Richard-
son Athletic Field now lies curdled in
pools on the gridiron at Cornelius, Rain

and more rain was the cause of the
change in program last Saturday, but

such a change made no effect on the
Wildcats in their clawing activities.
The game was to have been plaved on
the utility field, which is now completed
and is sprouting a fine sod of grass.
The preservation of this sod during the
wet season was the object in moving
the site of the battle.

Many visitors had come from far
and near to see the first game of the
season played on the new thirty thou-
sand dollar field, but they were doomed
to disappointment, and their cars were
headed in the direction of the Cor nelitg
metropolis in short order,

The field at Cornelius was in excel-
lent shape. The light rains had made
little effect on the sandy clay and the
ground was just damp enough not to
he hard, The battlefield was enclosed
with a high board fence on which were
perched hundreds of Wileat support-
ers. The side lines were populated to

'a depth of eight to ten feet on both

sides of the field.

From the end of the dinner hour
Saturday to the whistle’s shriek at
3:30, the streets in the southern end
of Davidson resembled those of Pom-
peii at the time of the eruption of
Vesuvius. As one man, the student
body moved to Cornelius and there be-
held the first victory of the Wildcats
for the season 1923, on foreign terri-
tory.
