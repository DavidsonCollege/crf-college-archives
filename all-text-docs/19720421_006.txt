These three young men just made < the

discovery of a lifetime. The oldest is 34.

Remember when a young man could get ahead in busi-
ness simply by growing old? It was a good system for
those with a little talent and a lot of patience, but today’s
technology moves too fast to wait for seniority.

At Kodak, our extensive involvement in basic research
has made the need for fresh, young thinking more press-
ing than ever. So we hire the best new talent we possibly
can. Then we do both of us a favor by turning them loose
on real problems, and giving them the freedom and re-
sponsibility they need to solve them.

That's how three Kodak acientists in their early thir-
ties just made a breakthrough in liquid lasers, develop-
ing an organic dye laser with a continuous beam. Their

discovery means more than just a new kind of laser. It
means a whole range of new laser applications, in fields
from medicine to communications.

It was the kind of discovery most men work a lifetime
for. Yet these young men stil] have most of their life-
times ahead of them.

Why do we give young men s0 much freedom and re
sponsibility? Because it’s good business, and we're in
business to make a profit. But in furthering our own busi-
ness interests, we also further society’s interests. And
that’s good. :

After all, our business depends on society. So we care
what happens to it.

Kk More than a business.
