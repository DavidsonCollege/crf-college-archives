When Reason Fails

So where do students go from here?

Research, consultation with faci Ity
members, a survey and finally a pro-
posal by a student committee, then
weeks pass while the faculty com-
mittee deals with “more important
matters.”

Then after having had the pro-

posal and report for weeks, the fac-

ulty committee consents to listen to
what the students have to say.

Then more delay while the pro-
posal is considered behind closed
doors and a “confidential” paper is
circulated among the members.

The student committee is called
back in and presented with what pur-

ports to be a “compromise,” but the
compromise turns out to be total loss
in the student column.

That’s what happened with the
student proposal to change the pre-
sent policy on scholarship students
on cars, the change that brought by
far the greatest student applause and
support in the student government
campaigns.

“Going through channels” has al-
ways been the call on this campus,
and “Be reasonable.”

But ‘it looks as if the channel has
been closed up and the second im-
perative. disregarded.

So where do students go from here?

Less Than Courteous

In case you haven't heard, the en-
tering freshman class next year may
be a good bit smaler than usual. As
of the middle of this week just over
200 students had made deposits, with
the deadline rapidly approaching.

We think that we have discovered
a part of the reason.

Last weekend, in at least two cases,
prospective freshmen were escorted
to the freshman dorms by a member
of the administration staff and then
dumped.

In both cases the students were left
in the trust of an unexpecting fresh-
man. with the staff member’s request,
“Help him get settled and show him
around.”

The admissions office had made no
arrangements for the housing of these
prospective students, and the fresh-
men left. in charge had to hunt for
vacated rooms to house the students.

The very apparent inconvenience
left both of these high school stu-
dents with the impression that they
were imposing and that, therefore,

they were unwelcome.

In the meantime the admissions
officer left, reportedly to help show
around some basketball prospects.

In another case, a third prospective
freshman was given the impression:
that the admissions office would find
him a ride to the airport Saturday
afternoon so that he could catch a
plane to New Jersey. At the last min-
ute he was able to find a ride, thanks
to the efforts of a few freshmen.

These were not the first cases of
mistreatment.

And, after all this, the admissions
office can’t understand why less than
the desired number are making their
tuition deposits for next year.

It is very probable that a little more
interest on the part of the admissions
staff would cure the problem at least
partially.

On the part of a number of pro-
spective students it appears. that the
first impression has been the lasting
one; it’s too bad it has been 30 poor
in so many cases.

A Lesson From The North

“Several years ago the school de-
cided to concentrate on admitting and
keeping more black students as a

long-range goal. Once they were in,’

it agreed (under some student pres-
sure) to set up a special program in
black studies.

“But new problems arose: black
students felt like guinea pigs instead
of students at Cornell; they wanted
more control over black studies; they
felt the school’s treatment of them
was racist. And groups of white stu-
dents better known in many quarters
as ‘jocks’ felt the university was going
too far out of-its way to cater to its
handful of blacks.” ;

Were it not for the name of Cor-
nell in this quotation, it might be
taken as a description of events at
Davidson five or six years from now.

It is not difficult to imagine the
sighs of relief from many associated
with the college that only six black
students are enrolled here, especially

when one sees the disruption wrought
at other schools. But Davidson will
finally come to admit more black
students, for a Christian liberal arts
school cannot serve just white mid-
dle class society: it must serve all.
And when the time comes, perhaps
soon, that the proportion of black
students creeps above one percent,
the question we want to ask is, will

Davidson be prepared?

If the future continues like the
past, the answer is no.

The DAVIDSONIAN Report of
April 18 made it clear that the col-
lege had not prepared for the first
Negro students, and that they were
left to themselves in a way that can
only be termed callous.

Let the story of Cornell stand as
a warning, lest the college move into
a new venture with its eyes closed
and suffer the unnecessary conse-
quences.

ROTC Rationale

To The Editor:

I hate to appear to be join-
ing in a chorus of inane
chants which have become
dull precisely because of con-
stant repetition, but I feel
that continual pressure must
be exerted to put ROTC on
a voluntary basis at David-
son.

We hear the tired old argu-
ment that ROTC helps stu-
dents for it teaches some-
thing important and useful

-and freshmen should there

fore be required to take it be-
cause they don't know what
they would be missing.

One might. with the same
logic. argue that we should
require all freshmen to go to
Alaska and see the plight of
the Eskimo children there.
for such an experience would
be much more rewarding ed-
ucationally.

Other arguments have been
bandied back and forth for a
long time. I would just like
to say that.it is ironic that

Lane Questions Subsidies

To The Editor:

1 would ike to respond to
the arguments set forth in
Mr. Sands’ letter in the April
4 DAVIDSONIAN.

The publicity associated
with the basketball program
Is at least in part a value.

While among. certain
Broups such publicity has
rather strong negative con-
notations (and this influence
should be weighed along with
any asserted benefits), sure-
ly Davidson is better known
among “‘the general public’
for having a talented basket-
ball team.

However. I think the value
of such recognition for a col-
lege should be put in the
context of the quality of the
institution involved.

Because an institution is
well known in the public
media does not affect the ba-
ste quality or educational in-
fegrity of that institution.

Thus, the value of such
publicity is somewhat qual-
ified when assessed in terms
of its contribution to those
ends.

Furthermore, the argu-

ment from publicity is tenu-
ous to say the least at the
point of claiming a direct
relationship between success-
ful athletic teams and a tru-
ly heterogenous student
body (i.e. heterogeneity be-
ing much more than simply
a function of geography).

Such a relationship has
yet to be explicitly demon-
strated. Finally, an attempt
to portray the athletic pro-
gram as a moving force in
the racial integration of the
school when that integration
is so minimal is self-defeat-
ing.

It is deceptive to evaluate
subsidization Itself in terms
of economic efficiency with-
out delineating the purposes
and goats to which thet effi-
clency ts aimed.

1s it publicity? Success in
terms of games won?

Again the discussion of
this particular policy must
be put in the context of what
Davidson as an educational
institution is and should be
about.

Only in that light can the
illegitimacy of the subsidized
program be established. Ec-

onomic efficiency alone is
not sufficient grounds for
such legitimacy.

The grounds for the con-
nection between a subsidiz-
ed athletic program and Da-
vidson’s’ uniqueness are very
unclear.

In the first place, there is
a significant number of in-
stitutions of higher learning
which have subsidized ath-
letic programs, so that such
a policy is hardly unique.

But beyond this, I hope the
issue of Davidson’s unique-
ness or conformity will be
raised on a more significant
level than whether it pays its
athletes or not.

In general ! would like to
see the discussion of this par-
tleular policy (and any other
policy) related to the broad-
er ends which If serves with-
in Davidson College as an ed-
ucational institution and the
functions which Davidson as
such pleys within the lerger
society.

I find it ironic and disap-
pointing that within an in-
stitution with a proclaimed
Christian commitment 60

much time is spent discussing
athletics or resolving student
in-fights and so little time
spent on systematic consid-
eration of social phenomena
such as the Vietnam War (it
is still going on) and the op-
position to it; a racial situa-
tion exploding in violence al-
most daily and the white rac-
ism which has substantially
created that situation; a gen-
eration gap dramatized in
family and university disor-
der; the problems of cities
built on economic and tech-
nological efficiency which
subordinates human values;
the economic, social, polit-
ical, and cultural impact or-
ganized technology is having
and will have on our society;
and, above all, the pervading
ethos, value structure, and
power relutionships in the
society which lead to an al-
location uf resources in such
a way as to constitute a
fundamental cause of many
of these problems as well as
a primary obstacle to their
solution.

should any professor in any
other department complain to
Dr. Spencer that only by dra-
gooning freshmen into their
classes without their choice
could the department § sur-
vive, Dr. Spencer would tell
that professor that he had
better return to his office
and make his courses more
palatable.

Why should the military
receive special exemption?
The fact that Davidson alum-
ni have been exempted from
ROTC during World War II
(my father .was one) makes
our situation even more ab-
surd. .

The use of the letter from
parents to exempt freshmen
from ROTC is not nearly ad-
equate. No freshman has to
take a course in any other
department just because his
parents didn’t write the dean.

Furthermore, the idea that
a freshman can make an in-
telligent decision about RO-
TC without being given a
chance to see what ROTC is

all about, especially at a =

time when, getting ready for
college, ROTC is one of the
last things on his mind, is
ridiculous.

As for conflict with par-
ents on having such a letter
written, I cannot emphasize,
but I have heard that such a
problem does exist, to what
extent I do not know.

As a sophomore, I am tak-
ing ROTC for the last term.
Despite my high respect for
some of the military men in
the ROTC Department, I
must say that I have not en-
joyed the experience, that
now I just don’t want to be
bothered with classes or
drill, and I want to spare the
Class of ‘73 and beyond from
having to share my experi-
ence if they don't want to.

_ We BEEN CARRYING
ON EXPERIMENTS

To The Editor:

Last week, the April 11 edi-
tion of THE DAVIDSONIAN
arrived, and I read it as al-
ways and put it down with
the usual sense of frustration.
I'm moved to express some
of the dissatisfaction I've felt
with you.

First, after four yeors of
faithful weekly reading, !
haven’! the foggiest notion of
what has happened or is hap-
pening on your campus.

I realize you do not write
for parents, but should you
sound like a student house
organ? I have travelled in
many towns and in many
states and have made a hob-
by of reading local newspa-
pers.

Your news items read like
inside jokes, and while it is
true that any writer who
wants to be read writes for a
specific audience, it's also
basic that the good writer as-
sumes. even at the
‘repeating himself, that his
reader knows nothing about

the . subject being written
about.
This point remembered

would certainly be helpful to
befuddled parents at home
and to many of your student
body as well.

This is not to say that I
sell your local readers short.
Quite the opposite. Davidson
students are big boys; they
are mature enough to hear
more than just the informa-
tion and ideas they like to
hear, and they are not hear-
ing them from your paper.

The good newspaper is an
abrasive to the establish-
ment, but it also gives the
establishment a voice, thus
providing the reader perspec-
tive and a chance to form his
own opinion, rather than
have it premasticated for
him.

When a reader finds too
much feeling and too many
words for the amount of in-
formation presented, he sus-
pects that the writer didn’t
know too much about his sub-
ject to begin with.

(It is a curious paradox
about THE DAVIDSONIAN
that the news items are high-
ly opinionated; the only facts
to be found are in the edi-
torials.) '

To sum up my complaint.
For the period | have read
you, you have been crusad-
ing when you should have
been reporting.

The result is tha. instead
of helping the causes you
quite justifiably support, you
have only confused some of
us who might have helped
you.

To The Editor:

All you have to be is about
half human to realize the dif-
ficulty of being a Negro to-
day, or ever. The same goes
for being anybody.

This realization was  ab-
sent from the comments of
Messrs. Brown, Williams and
Parks in the April 18 Report.

Allowing Brown this state-
ment that he taught himself
everything he knows, no
wonder his view is so infect-
ed and his~favorite word is
“bullshit.”

James Parks, no fool, ex-
pressed well the problem of
self-integrity in a sea of

nowledge this as a_ white
problem in a sea of humani-
ty.

ing to be his best self in a

"Stopping Ii” Is Easy

Two and a half years ago Bob was a freshman at
Cornell — University Hall Number Five, third floor,
last room on the right — one of 2500 entering fresh-
men in the fall of 1966. _

Tuesday Bob walked into millions of homes across
America. in stark contrast to the blood red cover
of “Newsweek,” Bob looked more like a revolutionary
than a college student. The guy from the last room
on the right, rifle in hand, brought fear to millions
of people who never even knew he existed. — ;

“Where does it stop?” shouts the nation in unison.
And is that really so unusual?

But what the concerned observer needs to con-
sider, without promise of finding concrete answers,
is “Where did it begin?’ and, more importantly,
“where does it go now?”

The answer lies not anywhere but everywhere.
But quick answers that gut reactions have failed
to go beyond the superficial. At this point such
responses are as superficial as the information on
which they are based. ;

A year and a half ago Black militancy drew its
first organized breath at Cornell. On a cool fall after-
noon a small group of students, faculty and adminis-
trators gathered in President, James A. Perkins’ of-
fice for a regular meeting of the President’s Commis-
sion on Undergraduate Education.

Constituted two years earlier as an advisory body,
the commission attempted to deal effectively with
undergraduate concerns before those concerns became

“unmanageable and to get undergraduate opinions on

matters of university policy and planning.

On this day the commission was asked to consider
a proposal. from the Afro-American Society. Adminis-
trators, professors and students were curious, inter-
ested —- but couldn’t quite understand it — Black
studies center, Black residence hall, Black museum,
Black cultural center. What did it all mean?

Only a few years before Blacks had sought inte-
gration, inclusion, acceptance. Was this a temporary
change of direction or would it continue? And how
long would it be before still another reversal would
occur?

With these kinds of considerations in mind and
with the clear perception that university finances
would not permit any major construction of dorms,
museums, or cultural centers, the commission advised
that it saw little direction open to the president save
investigation of the Black studies program.

Within a year a Black studies program was under-
way. By early spring of this year the Black Studies
Institute was on its way to issuing its first degree in
Black Studies — remarkably fast. movement for a
large institution of any sort.

In what some would call the ultimate in ironic
prophecy, a New York Times Magazine article of
April 6, five days before the Blacks took over Willard
Straight Hall, presented*the Cornell Black Studies
program's formulation as farsighted, worthy of emula-

on.
, The article concluded, “For the once-somnolent
institution . . . . the age of innocence has given way
to an experiment that may provide an important key
to the solution of America’s racial dilemma.”

Cornell had started looking for such solutions five
years ago. Then in 1965 the COSEP program was
initiated that has brought to campus most of the 250
Black students enrolled there now.

_ Cornell’s object was to look for solutions, not to
isolate the university from problems.

Bob came to Cornell because of this, as did Henry
Whitfield who presently leads the Blacks, as did Tom
Jones who said last Saturday, “I’m not going to disarm
and don’t think any Black student is going to disarm.”

Cornell started out to do something — to seek
solutions, not isolate itself from problems. Politicians
and newspaper editors and even college students can
cry out in dismay “Where does it stop?”

But Bob won't stop just for the sake of stopping.

Cornell started out to do something. The students
and faculty mdicated by fret, reaction to the recent
crisis that they still intend to do something — ,
still looking for solutions. g — they're
