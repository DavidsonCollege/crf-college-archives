Here At Last

Bittersweet. Such iis the taste left
in the mouth after thoughtfully chew-
ing the brand-new Honors College
proposal.

Sweet, because™the proposal rep-
resents at least a well-intended at-
tempt to “provide different oppor-
tunities for students of varying back-
grounds, motivations, interests, and
abilities.”

Bitter, for what appears on the
pages following this bright introduc-
tion looks suspiciously like a tradi
tional superstructure, manufactured
to’ fit nicely (or awkwardly) onto Da-
vidson’s already-existing traditional
educational substructure.

The sweetness of the proposal can
be found in several of the specific
provisions concerning the operation
of the College as well as the apparent
willingness to do some serious inno-
vating as seen in the spirit of the pro-
posals.

First there is the admission that
the program will not place specific
requirements on those seeking admis-
sion to it. To have described any limi-
tations on. the applicants would have
wrecked ‘the College at its outset and
to dismiss the idea that grade-point
averages could exclude a person from
admission is a significant positive step
for the college. It is a step that should
influence the attitudes of people in
the regular college as well.

We also find encouraging the ap-
parent diminution of the college's
predilection for elaborate application
forms. The simple formal application
procedure places the main weight of
acceptance on personal evaluation
where it really belongs. Perhaps here,
too, is a lesson for the college at large.

And now let us turn to the bitter-
ness of the proposal.

We hesitate to criticize the proposal
unfairly, for its general nature leaves
a good deal of room for truly excel-
lent maneuver. Indeed, we feel that
the avowed flexibility of the College
clears the way for many unique ed-
ucational experiences.

However, there are at least two
points made in the proposal which
stir uneasy thoughts. It is’stated that
the faculty of the Honors College
“will endeavor to assure a solid liber-
al education for each student as well
as opportunities for specialized studies
in depth.”’ This sounds amazingly simi
lar to a traditional “take the regular
courses and participate in a couple
tutorials” approach. We trust that
this is not what it will in practice
mean,

Most suffocatingly, we find that
the students on the College will re-
ceive grades, ‘Honors,’ ‘Pass,” ‘or
“Fail.” Now, there appear to be two
customary arguments advanced for
the giving of grades. The first is that
they provide motivation of some sort
for the student. The second is that
they stand as evidence of the stu-
dent’s general level of achievement
or proficiency.

It seems to us that the Honors
College student would inherently be
sufficiently motivated so as to abolish
the first argument for grades. As for
the second, perhaps a better, freer,
approach to the “for the record” prob-
lem would be to have the student’s

College professor write a short evalu-—

ation of his work and attitude.

We hope that those who participate
in the first formative year of this
new educational program will take
every opportunity to make it a truly
open-ended institution. The Honors
College should be a mind-expanding,
not a mind-structuring experience.

A Road Not Taken

In the best traditions of chapels
and area exams, it now seems that
the Machi House could fade from the
Davidson scene. Although the situa-
tion is, not yet definite, it. appears al-
most certain that overwhelming fi
nancial problems could force the pre-
sent local group back under. national
auspices.

However, while your editors could
sit back and relish the passing of
either of the first two institutions, the
demise of the Machi House must be at-

tended with more than a little regret. .

When some members of the Sigma
Chi fraternity decided to try to stick
out the split in the house that had
arisen over personality problems. by
forming a local fraternity, they em-
barked on one of the most promising
experiments to be undertaken by the
fraternity system in recent years.

The formation of the local Machi
House was a possible first step to-
ward providing Davidson students
with a real alternative to the present
‘“non-choice’”’ system provided by the
national fraternities and the College
Union.

Even more disappionting in the
failure is that even the plan to oper-
. ate a nonselective eating club prob-
ably cannot pull the Machi’s out of
their financial problems. 2
Such a club might’ have done very

much to facilitate change in the Da-
vidson system. But we may never
really know.

The inevitable changes that must
come in the campus. social system
have been shoved back into the hazy
future always conjured up by the
phrase ‘‘change from within the sys-
tem.” And we -are_ seeing the
dismal failure of such an attempt at
change.

Why might the local effort fall?
Simply because the treasurer could
not get enough money to pay the bills
forthe house. And that failure was not
his fault because he had already
shown his ability by.pulling the house
out ‘of a several thousand dollar debt.

No, the real failure is on’ the part
of the college. According to the ma-
jority report of the former Commis-
sion on Social Patterns the future of
the college should tend to a signifi-
cant reduction of the, roles of frater-
nities on this campus’. The original
split among the Sigma Chi’s led to a
step in that direction. Yet this step
was not cultivated.

Davidson was handed out of the
“Blue Sky,” as it were, an opportunity
to move in the directions it has avow-
ed it will move in the future. This
opportunity is being ignored and the
college is worse off for it.

The Old Exams Trick

It_comes_as-no-—surprise-to—usthat
the exam period is attended by more
violent complaining by students than
any other time during the school
year.

The major cause for those com-
plaints arises from the faculty rules
on the scheduling ‘of exams. Accord-
ing to the Faculty Academic Regula-
tions, exams must be given according
to the published schedule except in
extremely serious circumstances.

The first problem we see arises
from the faculty rules on the sched-
uling of exams. According to the Fac-
ulty Academic Regulations, exams
must be given according to the pub-
lished ‘schedule except in extremely
serious circumstances.

The trouble with every existing
schedule is that none can satisfy all of
students. No set, established schedule
could. Admittedly the faculty is not
playing up to the student desires in

B.C.

holding exams in the first place. but
it-seems that the schedules are a
needless and constant source of dis
may for the students. They are in-
variably too concentrated or too
spread out.

The only way to eliminate these
problems would be to design a sepa-
rate schedule for each student. Nat-
urally we could not expect the admin-
istration to provide such a service for
all the students so why not leave the
scheduling up to the students them-
selves? A system of self-scheduled ex-
ams would allow each person to pre-
pare for and take his exams under
the program that best suits him.

For those reasons we urge students
to. work for a-self-scheduling system
and to support Ran Coble’s efforts
when they are presented to the fac-
ulty in the Spring Term. With a
little luck, next week could be the
last time we ever have to complain
about an exam schedule.

Folger Challenges Spencer

On Open Dorms Proposal

To the Editor: ;

In a recent Davidsonian
article, President Samuel R.
Spencer, Jr. was quoted as
saying that ‘‘the — social,

- moral and ethical climate

are all part of the education-
al climate.’ I could not
agree more. However, he
went on to argue against
the 24-hour open dorms pro-
posal, On the other hand,
I disagree with this stand on
the basis of that same state-
ment.

It is indeed a fact that

the social, ethical, and edu-
cational climate are all in-
terrelated. For that very
reason we may ask if the
decisions made on one level
attitudes

do not reflect

ip

Future Spells Unrest

which are prevalent in the
whole system.

To be specific, does not
the policy of dictating to stu-
dents in the ethical realm
merely bear out the fact
that students are also dictat-
ed to on matters of educa-
tion? Just as faculty, admin-
istration, trustees, or what-

ever would tell us how.\o -

act in the dorms, so we are
told what to think (not how
to learn) in the classroom.
The same system that oper
ates to “‘close’’ the dorms
also operates to close men's
minds.

I hesitated to send this
letter because it says basi-
cally the same thing that
I said two weeks ago in my

last letter. However, Dr.
Spencer went on to argue
that morals in the dorm are
the responsibility of the
“continuing college com-
munity" — a nice way of
saying “the faculty and ad-
ministration."

This is too much! The
reasoning is that this con-
tinuing group should have
their say so because they
are more permanent and
not subject to the whims of
changing student moods.

This is precisely the
point: it is easy enough to
get completely shut off from
the rest of the world
while. at Davidson, and the
only influx of new ideas
comes from students. Their
opinions should be at least
considered if we are to
continue to fall behind the
times at only a moderate in-
stead of an exorbitant rate,
but Spencer would rather
protect the vested interests
of the faculty.

Is “the non-academic cli
mate . . . more a_ respon-
sibility of the continuing col-
lege community” simply
because those ‘‘continuers"’
have abdicated their re-
sponsibility in the academ-
ic area? Shouldn't students
have the major say so about
their own living conditions?

Yes, Dr. Spencer,: you are
right—a climate is being
set. Let us hope, however,
that this climate will be. one
of ‘Blue Skies’’ and clear
weather in an atmosphere
where men are encouraged
to think for themselves and

act responsibly rather than
the dismal overcast of ‘in
loco parentis,.’

Davidson College

With College Campuses

The national conference of
the American Association
for Higher Education met in
Chicago last week, but its
findings strike a pessimistic
note for colleges in the com
ing decade.

Educators see no reason
to expect a lull in student
unrest after the precedent
which has been set by activ-
ists in the past. Colleges
will no longer remain isolat-
ed and hallowed institutions
but will branch out into the

world, tackling ufgent pro-
blems which plague society
today.

Buctt G. Gallagher, form
er president of the City Col-
lege of New York, predicts
this trend and the necessity
of such a‘ step.

Colleges and universities
can—no_ longer wait on_the
glacial movement _of the
generauions retreat into the
ivory tower, rely on repres-
sion and indirection to get
them through times. of
trouble, Administrators, fac-
ulty members, and students
together will come: up with
the answers to° these pro-
blems, or they will go down

together, with the
ship,’ Buell said.

to bring changes in the sys-
tem which will alter the

drastically from their pre-
sent form.

Reactions of the confer
ence over the constructive
effects of “student activism
were varied. Several speak-

ers praised the idealism of
youths who have been in-
strumental in taking the in
itiative in war protest, civil
rights,—and—domestie—pottu=
tion,

Rep. William A. Steiger
(R-Wis.), who toured col
leges across ‘the’ nation last
year, expressed his regret
that students have lost faith
in their institutions and the
fear of many over the radi-
cal element among young
students.

Says Steiger, ‘‘We cannot
assume that the relative
calm which has _ prevailed
this -academic year is a
harbinger —of -a—return to
the years of silent: acques-
cense. It is a painful fact
for many people but, for
the foreseeable future, stu-
dent dissent is here to
stay.”’

The failure of colleges to
establish any broader forms
of increased student parti-

cipation in campus govern- |

ment has been a major pro-
blem around which student
dissent has centered.
Warren I. Susman, profes-
sor of history at Rutgers
University, believes that 1m-
prévement in campus gov-
ernance “‘in no sense pro-
vides for the reshaping of
existing institutions; it mere-
ly changes the nature of the

membership of such bodies.
It represents an extension of
paternalism on the part of
those in power. The addi-
tion of students to various
committees and even to
participate in decision-mak-
ing. at the highest level lets
out students — indeed only
some of our students — play
house.”’

Bua PERcept |

By PAUL E. ROWLAND

seecaemnemnmmmemmenemmatmccene .
Read It Again, Sam

Dean Richard C. Burts propounded the past-mid-
night doctrine of evil last year to fala the College’s
curfews at the fraternity houses. His suggestion that
most evil occurs after the bewitching hour was greet-
ed with hisses, raucous laughter and subsequent ridi-
cule. Perhaps the impolite student reaction was not
caused by absurdity of the theory
but by fond memories that the most
successful grubbing did indeed .oc-
cur in the wee hours of the morn-
ing.

But now Dg: Spencer has made
a series of statements (see the front
page of last week’s DAVIDSONIAN)
that deserve polite but decimating
ridicule.

In summary Spencer said that the non-academic
climate at Davidson is the responsibility of the ‘“‘con-
tinuing college community,” that the “continuing
community” refers to those connected with the col-
lege longer than students, and finally that he disap-
proves of the “idea” of girls staying overnight in
men’s dormitories. :

On these premisses, Spencer has taken a stand
opposing 24 hour open dorms. :

ROWLAND

. With so many opportunities, one hardly knows

where to begin faulting this argument.

Why not begin by looking at the Code of Respon-
sibility Preamble: ;

*'The present Code of Responsibility is based upon
the belief that Davidson’s educational purpose can
best be advanced in a context which emphasizes the
responsible use of freedom, as opposed to dicense. The
aim of this code is to encourage individuals to develop
responsible judgement capable of directing conduct
with a minimum of specific prohibition. An elaborate
system of rules strictly enforced might promote a
surface conformity to the standards of behavior de-
sired, but would not effectively serve to develop the
maturity of character which is the aim of the college.
Rather, responsible maturity is more likely to de-
velop when a member of the college community is
both free and obligated: to wrestle with principles of
conduct and to accept full responsibility for his own
actions and decisions.”

___ Nowhere in the Code can I find Spencer’s distinc-
tion between students and other members of the com-
munity in bearing responsibility for the non-academic
climate. And as I read the Code, Spencer is subject
to its provisions as much as I am, so that neither of
us may legislate amendments by decree.

_The practical problems involved in putting such a
distinction into effect would be insurmountable. You
would have to stay around four years before you had
a significant part in the decision making process ac
cording to Spencer’s reasoning. That would e inate
professors on two year appointment and even Reeaiee
himself.

As for Spencer’s disapproval of the idea of girls
Staying overnight in men’s dormitories, I'd have sev+
eral comments. Apparently he forgot that the College
Supervizes just that en masse three times each year,
but I think we can assume poor wording on Spencer’s
part and that he probably meant girls staying over-
night with the. boys. :

Apparently Spencer is irked that many students
seem to equate wrestling with principles of conduct
with wrestling with one’s date. That irritation is under-
standable even if I don’t share his convictions (and
I don’t).

Spencer’s stand violates the spirit of the Code by
preempting individual responsibility in favor of “sur-
face conformity to desired standards of behavior.”

(While investigating abuses of the Code, the Stu-
dent Life Committee should also look into abuses by
members of the “continuing college community” as
well as by students.) : :

A 24 hour open dorm plan would provide the
freedom and obligation to wrestle with moral issues
of conduct and consequences which the Code ‘says is
more likely to result in responsible maturity. ——

On a more practical level, why should a student
caught with a girl in his room at 11-a.m. be prosecut-
ed if he is not punishable for having a girl in his room
an hour later when open dorms officially begin? “Be-
cause ‘the rules say so” is not an acceptable answer
because, I contend, such a rule is unfairly arbitrary.

Why should the College feel called upon to legis-
late student morals but not faculty and administration
morals? :

I have considerable respect for Dr. Spencer both
as President of the College andi as a person. but |
also feel that his stand on this issue is indefensible.

Perhaps Spencer’s remarks were to appease the
College’s more conservative beneficiaries.

An Open Letter to President Spencer;
Dear Sir:

..... Chapter of _., in a rare
burst of public spirit and ethnic
pride, is prepared to make a pro-
found- personal sacrifice for the bet-
terment of the entire Davtdson Col-
lege Community.

We propose to release the frater-
nity house which we presently hold
so that it can become the Southern
White Cultural Center:

We feel.a Southern White Cultural
Center is a necessity at Davidson.
Southern whites. are-a minority that

_ 8 widely discriminated against in
northern rgeions. At Davidson their
problems have largely been ignored
until only a step of this magnitude

ion,

The social life and‘ happiness of
this beleaguered minority needs a cul-
tural center to improve their identi-
ty and social life as well as to make

» able,

The ad hoc committee on Southern

White Studies therefore proposes that:

1. the College take over the

House and debt :and
cede this house to the SWCC
(Southern White Cultural Cen-
ter)

. the college give the SWCC
$3,000 to renovate the frater-
nity house.

3. the SWCC be allowed to hold
private meetings every Thurs-
day and restrict membership
to those acceptable to this
organization.

In-return the SWCC will establish

a Southern White Cultural Exhibit

which will be open to the public three

times a year. (see appendix 1)

We eagerly await your reply.
