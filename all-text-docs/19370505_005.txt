Warfire Exhibited By
R.O.T.C. Department

On Monday afternoon at the reg-

ular drill period, the military de-
partment put on a demonstration
to.show the horrors and actual me-
chanics of warfire. This vivid ex-
hibition, for students and towns-
people, was for the purpose of
showing the true nature of wars,
in the hope that it would instill
in them motives of peace. The
military department believes that

this method is most practical and
effective way to make people want
peace.

This exhibition was in the form
of a sham battle, in which machine

guns, automatic rifle, and trench
mortar were used. The machine
guns were fired by the jun
ior members of the R. O. T. C., the
automatic rifle by Sergeant Burton
ind the trench mortar by Major
Siefert.

The military department also be-
lieves that this should instill into
the students the need for trained

men to fight if a war should break
out,
