Mendenhall Scorns Apathy;

Gillie Desires Coeducation

To the Editor:

Well it’s that time again,
that barefoot, shirtless, sun-
shining time when spring
fever strikes once again.
Unfortunately the Davidson
brand of spring fever packs
an extra punch — it’s called
apathy.

The term apathetical is a
handle which has come to
fit the Davidson student all
too well, and it seems to have
reached a new high this
spring.

I have seen the day when
a class of sophomores rallied
in. Love Auditorium to pro-
test against Area Exams. I
have seen D.C. students fill
the Union Lobby for an Open
End on  coeducation, But
these days are long gone by.

Last Monday night four
people showed up for an Open
End .on the food service,
and not one of them was a
freshman; Amid the continual
gripes about the. food and
cafeteria service, there
doesn’t seem to be anyone
who cares about anything ex-
cept griping. eos

‘Say. Hello To Yesterday’

By DAVID WELLS

“Say Hello to Yesterday,”’
starring Leonard Whiting in
his first role since he played
Romeo in ‘‘Romeo and Jul-
iet,”’ is, roughly speaking,
the story of an affair. Sound
familiar? It is.

Picture. the +andsome,
devil-may-care hero, the
black sheep of his hard-
working, lower class family,
jobless and practically pen-
niless, yet possessing a
dauntless spirit and an all
too ready wit: in short, the
archetypal stud.

Enter the once beautiful,
now sagging middle-aged
housewife from the right side
of the tracks, as she is play-
ed by Jean Simmons. She
has it all, successful husband,
lovely family, house in the
country, security. But is she
happy? Of -ceurse not! With
all of that, who needs: hap-
piness?

On the packed morning
commuter train, he acci-
dently catches sight of her,
and immediately decides to
“climb Mount Everest,’ a
somewhat Freudian euphem
ism for his intention to
seduce her.

Through. innumerable
trials and tribulations he pur-
sues his prey, never accept-
ing no for an angwer, until
finally, at long last, ‘she
capitulates.

After an unusually sterile
bedroom: scene (why do they
bother wrapping up in the
bedsheets after making love,
unless it’s to keep their GP
rating?), she sees the futil.
‘ity in trying tocontinue the
affair, and decides to go
back to her home in Colbin,
the ‘English equivalent of the
Country-Club Estatés.

‘But I love you,’ he pro.

tests, sounding almost as
believeable as Spiro Agnew
commending the VVAW for
their patriotism..By the end
of the picture, however, he
succeeds in convincing him-
self that he does love her,
and chases after her depart-
ing train, holding out a yel-
low balloon as a farewell
present, no doubt a symbol
of his carefree, child-like
heart.

But alas, too late! The

train pulls out too soon, and —

he is left broken - hearted,
holding the balloon, so to
speak.

It's all right, though, the
sadness lasts only a few
moments. As the. music
swells to its climactic forte,
he impetuously buys fifty
more ballons and. releases
them over Victoria Station,
thereby signifying his jubi-
lant acceptance of the real-
ization that ‘‘memories are
forever,’' as well as contri-
buting to the atmospheric
pollution over the city of
London.

The primary weakness of
“Say Hello to Yesterday’’ is
that it tries to embellish a
litthee too heavily on the
hackneyed theme of the
extra-marital affair. The
problem is one of credibility.

On the one hand, there is
an obvious attempt made at

offering some kind of rele-

vant criticism of modern
society.

The question seems to be,
“Why can’t one be both ‘suc-
cessful’ and ‘happy’ at the
same time?,’” but there is
no palpable explanation or
acceptable answer suggested,
and even if there were, it
would be obscured “by the
trivial, often embarassingly
contrived stabs at humor and

spontaneity.
Despite its numerous, glar-

‘ing absurdities, ‘‘Say Hello to

Yesterday’’ still proves cap-
able of imparting that warm
feeling of momentary eupho-
ria, very much similar to
that experienced after the
first reading of ‘‘Love Story,”’
before one realizes com-
pletely what kind of trick
has been pulled.

Less than 15 students show-

than 10. students showed up
to talk with Will Terry about

To the Editor:

During my two years at
Davidson I have come to
fee] more and more strongly
that the most important is-
sue facing the Davidson
community is* coeducation.

I am sure that the reasons
for coeducation must be ob-
vious for anyone who has
ever been a part of the
Davidson College commun
ity.

The most important argu-
ments are probably that edu-
cation should be a part of

ide

A survey was taken among 259 West Virginia
students in two classes concerning the school year-
book, The Monticola, and the proposed revisions in
it, the school newspaper, The Daily Athenaeum, has

reported.

The poll revealed that only 54 students out of
259 had ever bought a yearbook (costing nine dollars),
and that 92 of the remaining 199 said that they would
never buy one under the present system.

Among other things, the proposed changes would
include tripling the number of color photographs (to

48), dropping all advertisin
by an increase of

yearboo
dent fees.

The proposal will go to the student legislature,
and if passed, will be presented to the students in

the form of a referendum.

Peace Treaty Challenged

Chairman of the Chapel Hill chapter of the Young
Americans for Freedom, David Adcock, has called for
a public expose of the People’s Peace Treaty, challeng-
ing UNC radicals to an open debate on the treaty.

Adcock claimed, the Daily Tar Heel learned, that
there are twenty different copies of the treaty circul-
ating throughout the country, and that the South
Vietnamese Student Union cited in the treaty as hav-
ing ratified it does not exist.

the real world, that education
involves the development of
the whole person rather than
just the mind, and that the

* most important purpose ‘of a

liberal education is to lead
us to a greater degree of
self-knowledge and to a more
complete realization of our
human capabilities as we
séek to live more fully —
purposes which can best be
accomplished in a _ coedu-
cational environment.

One argument that is often
made for delaying coeduca-
tion is that we should ap-
proach the issue from the
standpoint of what Davidson
can do for the girls as well
as of what the girls can do
for Davidson. I agree.

But I think that we should
also considér the coeds who
are now coming here under
the Eight College Exchange
Program. If we believe that
Davidson doesn’t have any-
thing to offer for the edu-
cation of young women, it is
sheer hypocrisy to rontinue
to admit even five or ten
exchange students each year.

Another point that should
be brought out is that a girl
who wants to attend a co-
educational college with an
excellent academic reputa-
tion has very few schools to
choose from in this part of
the country. By going co-
educational Davidson would
therefore be helping to fill
an important educational
need.

The really important ques-
tion here, I think, is a mat-
ter of attitudes. Once we
commit ourselves to the goal
of coeducation, ways can be
found to overcome the econ-
omic difficulties.

One possibility would in
volve an exchange program
whereby Davidson students
could take courses at Queens
and vice versa. I am told
that such a program already

exists, under the Charlotte

Area Consortium, but ‘that
“unfortunately, few students
have taken advantage of it.”

If the administrations of
the two schools would make
an effort to inform students
of the opportunities of parti-
cipating in this program, it
could provide a means to
achieve a significant degree
of coeducation, at little cost
and with no detrimental ef-
fect on the quality of edu-
cation. Other means of
achieving more coeducation
could also be worked out

If you agree with me that
coeducation is desirable at
Davidson at the earliest pos-
sible date, please take a few
minutes to write a letter
expressing your views to
either President Spencer or
the chairman of the Board
of Trustees, Dr. Warner Hall,
1000 E. Morehead St., Char-
lotte, N.C. T

We, as students, can have
a significant influence on the
making of important policy
decisions by the college. But
we must let our voices be
heard.
