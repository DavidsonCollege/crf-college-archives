Theft, carelessness é abuse library, ‘Honor Code

By STEVE AUSTIN
Staff Writer

The Davidson College libra-
ry has lost about 800 books
over a 3-year period from
1974-1977 according to Direc-
tor of the. library Leland M.
Park in a report to the SGA
senate.

The loss is down somewhat
from a high in 1973 but Park is
concerned about its: reflection
on the honor code. He is
disappointed that the library’s
policy of openness is not more
appreciated. Said Park of the

library’s system: “This is so
much better than our prot-
eges’ in the academic wo

No checks are made at the
door and no staff member is
present after 10 pm.

Besides the problem of lost
books, the library staff must
go around at the end of each
year to the halls and houses to
collect unchecked books. The
books are not stolen; they
finally end back in the library
but Park calls the practice a
“gross discourtesy.”’

the problem too. Park tells the
story of how he had to search
the office of a professor gone
for the summer, for an overdue
book and found a number of
others that were unchecked.
Two systems to reduce the
number of losses were sugges-
ted by Park but not necessari-
ly recommended. The first
would place a magnetic strip
in each book that would

trigger an alarm if a patron}

tried to exit without checking
his books. The second would
involve. having student work-

-ers check each person leaving
the building.

Senator Dave Barnard opt-
ed for a tougher policy for the
honor code violators.

He commented that forget-
fulness is not the problem:
“These are stolen books; the
honor code is the answer.”’
However, neither the senate
nor Park wanted to turn to
room checks which are com-

mon at some schools.

Jim Tholen summed up the
Senate’s feelings by saying
that the solution is to ‘‘prick
the consciousness of the stu-
dents.’ The body voted to do
so by sending letters to every
dorm and administrative

room.

Not that water isn't important to a beers taste.

It is. Very important,

But the fact is, virtually all brewers filter

and further purify their brewing water.

And Schlitz doesn't stop there. They put their
water through what they believe is the most
sophisticated purifying process of any brewer
in the world.

So when they're through, it's purer than the purest
sprinqwater.

Breakfast policy clarified

Questions have recently arisen over an ARA Food Service
policy that prohibits meal card holders from using their cards to
purchase anything other than a continental breakfast at the
snack bar from 10-11 AM.

The continental breakfast includes coffee or milk, sweet roll
and juice. Eggs and other items are sold on a cash basis and can
not be bought with a meal ticket because the ARA contract does
not provide for such an arrangement.

- ARA Director Ron Scott explained that the price of the dining
club plan is based on. about 40 percent of its members eating
breakfast and 70-80 people taking advantage of the continental
breakfast.

Scott says he is looking into the possibility of offering
continuous service in the next few years.

Meanwhile Scott advises late-eaters not to consider the

continental breakfast an ‘‘extended breakfast,” but rather an
additional service.

Extended studies settled

The Faculty passed the Educational Policy Comittee’s (EPC)
proposals concerning Extended Studies last week with only
minor revision.

The EPC proposed to keep Extended Studies for freshmen
and sophomores with only two changes. Most projects will be
ics tonal departmental supervision and all will graded only
pass-

Mandatory Extended Studies 301s and 401s for juniors and
seniors will be abolished. Instead, individual departments will
have the choice of whether to keep the projects or to establish
new major requirements.

Professors will be limited to sponsoring only three projects
per year to lessen their teaching load,

Extended Studies Committee Chairman Hansford Epes is
pleased with the proposals, because he believes placing
freshmen and sophomore projects under departments will. belp
