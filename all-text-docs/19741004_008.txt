Anyone escaping from the pursuit of
knowledge long enough to wander
around campus after 4 p.m. may have
noticed a lone figure strolling
about...the guardian of* Davidson
security, ‘‘Cop’’ Ray Sherrill.

Cop Sherrill has been associated
with Davidson for four years,
becoming a very familiar face, if not

‘ an institution. He began his c
with the college in the year of the in-
famous 4th East Gang. (“‘I sure miss
those ol’ buggers,”’ he chuckled. )

Cop Sherrill seems always to be
around-streaks; waterfights—but fin-
ding him when looking for him is
another matter. After finally tracking

‘him down on a rainy afternoon, we
escaped into his dry-office for a chat.

Over cokes and crackers, we settled
down to business, Cop Sherrill lamen-
ting inflation--‘‘Crackers gone up to 15
cents! Just can’t believe it!”’

Perched on a stool, Cop Sherrill
talked of his family of four children,
three grandchildren (‘‘and another on
the way’’), and his home in the coun-
try--‘‘just about six acres--we grow
oodles of stuff.’ According ‘to Cop
Sherrill, several Davigson men are
“real farmers.”’

“T’ll tell you one lesson it took
Davidson to teach me, and that’s that
you can hypnotize a chicken!” he con-
fided.

It seems that DuBose Porter, one of
the “real farmers’ of Davidson,

Security
With A Smile

demonstrated the technique of hyp-
notizing a chicken on a recent visit to
the Sherrills.

Although Cop Sherrill wasn’t too
sure just what this feat involved, he
was very impressed and swore that it
was “‘a fact!”

DuBose the Hypnotist is only one of
the students Cop Sherrill has claimed
as a friend over the years. One of the
reasons he values his job at Davidson
(in addition to its glamour and ex-
citement) is the chance it gives him to
talk to students. “And he will talk, if
given an opportunity.

An open, friendly man, Cop Sherrill
is very proud of his connection with
the college, and of being able to ‘‘walk
amongst the green grass and y’all-it

means more than any money.”

He considers most Davidson
professors ‘‘down to earth people,”
and remarked that at . Davidson,
“everybody’s the same--only way to
tell money is to watch what people
drive, and that’s the truth.”’

Cop Sherrill scratehed his chin and

Toean’t bear toleok. ..

mused, “the girls been a help—calmed
the boys down some—but a lot of them
(the boys) won’t admit it, you know.”’

An old Davidson yarn Cop Sherrill
had to offer goes.as follows...a few
years back, he noticed a shiny red
Rolls Royce convertible parked out-
side Chambers. Curious, Cop Sherrill
waited for its owner.

In talking to the owner, he
discovered the old gent had been a
Davidson student a few decades ago.
While at school, he had kept a car hid-
den in an elderly widow’s garage in
town, paying her a weekly tent.

He "used this contraband car for oc-
casional trips to Charlotte and other
wicked cities considered unsuitable
for young Davidson gentlemen. One
particular weekend, the luckless car
owner got plastered and failed to pay
his garage rent. The widow im-
mediately went to the Dean, and the
poor fellow was campused for eight
weeks, along with numerous other
nasty reprimands.

Cop Sherrill thoughtfully remarked

that this same hell-raiser went on to
drive a red Rolls Royce convertible.
Concerning current politics, Cop

” Sherrill remarked: ‘just don’t think

President Ford should’ve pardoned
Mr. Nixon-the other folks up there got
families, too, you know.”’

Cop Sherrill was warned against
Nixon many years ago by an elderly
lady friend. ‘‘She said she shook his
(Nixon’s) hand once, and he had that
‘gangster look’ in his eyes!-thought
about what she said a lot since
then...”

He follows Davidson sports, with
the exception of rugby--‘‘just can’t un-
derstand that game!”’

Cop Sherrill values his memories of
Davidson--old friends who have
graduated over the years, asking
Dean Rusk about his dish-washing
days at Davidson, (‘‘...he said he
guessed he’d washed ’bout as many
dishes as anybody ever did...”),
talking with Senator Sam Ervin,
(“I’ve met ’um all!’’), selling
prospective freshmen on Davidson. ‘a

Old yarns, fresh home-grown
tomatoes, invitations to a possum
hunt, conversation and company--Cop
Sherrill offers them all.

And although Davidson may not of-
fer Cop Sherrill too much crime to
combat, it does. offer him the op-
portunity to do the thing he does so
well--intermingling with the college

community, being a familiar part of
the face of Davidson.
