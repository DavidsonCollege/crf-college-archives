THE DAVIDSONIAN OPINIONS i

MONDAY, APRIL 18, 1994

C ainsned tightly into acold, gray
prison cage, the thirty or thirty-
five women would not be able to
sit down if they wanted to. In the
corner, lying down on the only
cement bench in sight, an apparent
veteran displays her power. Penned
up for hours as they wait to be
driven to the courthouse for their
monthly battle with “justice,” these
inmates are trapped in a society of
their own.

Welcome to the world where
your shampoo must be alcohol-
free and your social worker is your
best friend. Plagued with a new set
of fears, youcannotdecide whether
you’d be safer here or back at home.
In spite of the fact that our nation
employs more private security
guards than police officers, our
prisons abound with thievery and
violence. To quote the April 10th
edition of the New York Times,
referring to the second of two re-
cent serious disturbances at one

prison in which 22 officers and -

inmates were injured, “. , . the
system is in shambles” and“. . . the
inmates are out of control.”

For as long as I can remem-
ber, I have agonized over the idea
of keeping people in prisons. I
believe that punishment must be
severe, but I will be satisfied with
the practice of incarceration no
sooner than I would encourage a
father to lock his son in the base-

ment for breaking curfew or for-
getting to take out the trash.

For many people, imprison-
ment results from being with the
wrong person, in the wrong place,
at the wrongtime. The majority of
women in New York’s Rikers Is-
land prison, for example, are in-
carcerated because they have been
“drug mules,” used by men to bring
drugs into the country. For what-
ever the reason, just or unjust, over
1.25 million people are currently
in local, state and federal U.S. pris-
ons. Another three million are
involved in the penal systems
through either probation or parole.

For the 80% of incarcerated
women who are mothers, and the
75% who are single mothers, go-
ing to prison will result in the loss
of any bond with their families.
Take Sonia, for example, an in-
mate who has notseen her fourteen
year-old son in over twelve years.
Sonia suddenly became interested
in locating her son when she found
out that she was HIV-positive and
was worried that her son had con-
tracted the virus as well.

Another true story, Jena was

forced to part with her newborn

daughter at the hospital and is now ~

only hoping that the foster care
agency will grant her parental vis-
its with her child. Consider as well
that New York pays $95,000 a year
to keep one person in Rikers Is-

land, and $19,000 a year for every °

child placed in foster care:

Ofcourse, many steps can and
must be made to improve the
present system. Criminal justice
activists must come together to

_Sensitize the public to the increas-

ing impact of criminal justice. The
interreligious network must unite
to meet the unsatisfied spiritual
and psychological needs of in-
mates. Volunteers can increase
the development:and use of alter-
native programs and prevention
programs to divert people from
incarceration.

Asynthesis between effective
punishment of criminals and inno-
vative prevention of crime would
better the system. Preventative
measures must be undertaken to
attack crime at its roots. The drug
problem could be addressed more
directly, and more rehabilitation

on, sol broke out the big guns. “I’d
like to call you sometime. What’s
your number?”

The poor girl was so flustered
she couldn’t speak. She reached
into her back pocket to get, I pre-
sumed, a pen. Instead she came
out with her key chain. “Yes, I
said. I’m the guy who wrote about
the keys in the back pocket. What
is that red cylinder you’ve got on
your....”

My sentence was cut off as a
cloud of pepper gas caught me full .

in the face. It seems the girl never
reads the school paper.

My moment of self-confi-
dence was cut short like John
Bobbitt. (I couldn’t resist. It’s the

last one, I swear.) I thought my .

Cinderella story was too good to
be true. My fifteen minutes of
fame apparently started at 11:58. I
have turned back into a scullery
maid; my flannel shirts have turned
into the fashion of 1993; my apart-
ment has turned into a cesspool;
my car has turned into a lemon.
Just like Beck says, “I’m a loser,
baby.”

There is a happy ending to my
adventures in studville. For my
graduation present, my father got
mea fancy-wancy lawyer. I threat-
ened legal action against every girl
who sprayed me with pepper gas,
and my lawyer has cut a deal with
every one of them. Every girl who
has ever used violence against me
now has to approach me, smile,
laugh at my jokes, and touch my
arm. I must have run into one such.

centers could be created for ad-
dicts. Economic options might be
created for those to whom crime
appears the only road to financial
teward.

These solutions, however, still
would not satisfy me. The prob-
lems associated with criminal jus-
tice appear impossible for me to
solve. Could it be that what we are
missing, dare I suggest, is instead a
system of criminal mercy?

This summer I will be work-
ing for the Rikers Island prison
ministry in New York City. I look

- forward to being in an office where

the staff circles up to pray every
morning before they begin to pro-
vide their services. ‘A ray of hope
comes from the knowledge that
the goals of the Women’s Advo-
cate Ministry lie not only in meet-
ing the inmates’ social and physi-
cal needs, but in “. . . setting at
liberty those who are broken by
life” (Luke 4:18).

Regardless of the extent to
which my efforts reach, Iam aware
that crime and punishment will
only continue to increase. I have
also become aware, however, that
by contemplating and considering
what is and happens around me,
even in the midst of a seemingly
hopeless world condition, I might
eventually come to a place of pow-
erful and fearless response. Per-
haps, then, I will be satisfied.

Of course, the answer is yes,
they can get some play because the

Of course, there is a certain

seniors begin to realize that there
are at least ten women (or men)

So, they figure, “Hey, I have four

Perhaps the most frightening

How are you
doing?

Hetio, how are you? I know
you, I knew you, I think I can
remember your name.”—Michael
Stipe (R.E.M.)

' How are you doing? Fine.
What’s up? Not much.

‘This past week I ‘have been
obsessed with this exchange of
words which everyone at Davidson
says at least, fifty times daily. I
have become so compulsive in
thinking about this topic that when-
ever anyone says “How are you
doing?” or “What’s up?” I just
-look at them and laugh. Some-
times I feel like responding to their
innocent question by saying some-
thing like, “I am presently grap-
pling with the existential loneli-
ness of my human condition.”
When I respond in either way,
people just give me a strange look
and usually call me a freak. (No
wonder I have a hard time getting
a date at this school!)

So what do these little innocu-
ous questions really mean? With-
out being too negative, it is safe to
say that people are not really ask-
ing what is your present intellec-
tual, spiritual, emotional, or physi-
cal condition. Whenever I ask
someone such a question, I am
usually just recognizing the fact

affirming his or her existence. “I
affirm your existence as a fellow
traveler on the journey of life and
as a fellow child of God,” would be
a more appropriate thing for me to
say or simply “I affirm you,” if
we’re in a rush.
Okay, when am I going to get
Yeo the point? Having rambled on
about the question “How are you
doing?” I'll let my thoughts turn to
|. a deeper question, “How are you
Peally doing?” If we are honest
with ourselves and truly examine
our whole selves which are hidden
from others, then the answer sud-
denly becomes far less simple.

As I thought about this ques-
tion, the first thing which popped
into my mind was the recent sui-
cide of Kurt Cobain, lead singer of
Nirvana. Why would a person
who had the riches of the world,
fame, a wife and a baby daughter
decide to kill himself, especially
when he was apparently “getting
better”? Ican only speculate, but I
have a suspicion that he viewed the
same reality which caused Kurtz
in Joseph Conrad’s The Heart of
Darkness to exclaim, “The horror.
The horror.”

It is easy to gloss over “the
horror” of our lives. It is also easy
tosimply escape life, either through
suicide or any activity which has
the result of deadening our lives.
What takes true courage is when
we come face to face with “the
horror” and decide to continue our
journey in the realm of the living.
I hope, if God were to someday
say, “Hi Rob, How are you do-
ing?”, Lcould simply stand naked,
look up, smile, and respond, “God,

quirements.

Ihave seen the horror. By the way,
how are you doing?”
