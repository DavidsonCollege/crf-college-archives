Sophomore Team Undefeated in
Five Contests—Anderson Leads
in Scoring

The Class Basketball at Davidson has

come to a close and the Sophomores |

carried off everything. In

passing and deadly shooting. The Juniors
were the only ones who held the Sophs

to any close scores and, although they!

lost the two games played with the

Sophs, they were hot contests, the scores |

being 32-29 and 27-17.

The entire Sophomore team showed
up well, being led by Captain Anderson.
Anderson and Faucette were in the lime-
light in all the games and, were they
not guarded closely, ran up large scores.
Keerans and Simpson were good on the
defense for the Sophs.

The Juniors had a nice running team

and at times loked as though they would
give the Sophomores a close fight, but
they lost both of their games with the
Sophs and somewhat hurt their stand-
ing. Lawson and Huie were prominent
with the Juniors. They had two unplay-
ed games with the Fresh and most likely
would have won these and their stand-
ing would have been better although they

had no chance of beating the Sopho- +

mores out.

The Seniors had a plucky little team
led by Harry Price who, although a guard,
stood near the top of the chief scorers.
Probably the hottest game, they won
over the Fresh by a lone point margin
playing two extra periods to decide it.
The final score was 26-25.
the Sophs by a close margin. Losing to
the Juniors and again to the Sophs, they
had three defeats to their two wins ov-
er the Fresh.

There was nothing spectacular in the
Fresh team as they did not win a game.

_ The Kick-Off

By Don Wharton

The largest crowd ever assembled for
a gridiron contest in western North Car-
olina certainly got an eyeful Saturday
when probably the two hardest fighting
teams of the state fought for forty-eight
scoreless minutes before Bunn Hackney,
with the wind at his back, sent a fifteen-
yard drop-kick sailing a few feet above

the cross-bar.

unless a bunch who are out for football
show up better than those who are out
now there will not be much force to the
Fresh team.

Tom Anderson led the scoring in field
and foul goals, having a total of 70 points
to his credit. Faucette, also of the Soph-
omores, stands next with 49 points. Law-
son of the Juniors is third

There are about three men on the line
and several in the backfield that will
find their place on the Davidson varsity
next fall—others may turn up as sudden
finds but these can be relied upon. Their
greatest test, however, comes tomorrow
when they meet the powerful Furman
eleven. It will be a fight that will mean
a perfect record and even the champion-
ship of the two Carolinas should the
Wildkittens win.

His two kicks Saturday following three
\failures, not to mention Devin’s fizzle,

\that Davidson would need him in the
Thanksgiving game.

The Davidson team has no snap game
before them. A victory will come only
from another week of the hardest kind
of physical and mental work on the part
of the Wildcat squad and real support
on the part of the Davidson student body.

|Coach Rawson Takes Yearlings to

| Meet Furman in Greenville
Tomorrow

|
| The Wildkittens close their 1924 season
Friday when they play the young Hur-
ricane from Furman University at Green-
ville, S.C. The Furman Fresh team has
| developed into a real strong breeze this
|season and have laid claim to the cham-
pionship of the Palmetto State.

Their most recent conquest was the
Biddies from the University of South
Carolina whom they trounced 40 to o.
The only game in which they came out
of with the short end of the score was
with Georgia which beat them 19 to 0.
This was the lowest score to which the
Bull Pups have been held this season.
The Furman team won from Citadel 40-0
and also defeated Clemson Fresh.

Furman has a big, fast team. The
men are experienced and play a sure,
steady game. The backfield lead by
Pickins and Rawls have the drive that
has proven almost invincible so far this
season. Pikens stands out as one of the
best Fresh backfield men in South Caro-
lina.

He is a wonder on the offense and one
of the surest tackles that has been de-
veloped at Furman. Rawls, a former
Batesburg star, is quarterback and has
proven to be a fast broken field runner.

Burns, who shown brightly for several
years at Sumter high is holding down
right end. He tackles clean, hard and
has the drive that is hard to stop.

The Davidson Wildkittens to Green-
ville after ten days of practice since
Armistice Day, when they defeated Oak
Ridge Prep 36-3 at Statesville. Raw-
son’s proteges have yet to be defeated
and the as Furman game is the last of
this highly successful season whether or
not their slate is to be kept clean de-
pend entirely upon their ability to con-
tinue Rawson’s good work.

Laws, Melton, and Nesbit, who have
been suffering from injuries are likely to
be seen in action, although they are not
slated to start. Captain Dick Grey will
probably lead the same team that start-
ed against Oak Ridge on the field Fri-
day. Grey .is one of ‘the best backs in
North Carolina and he has proven to be
a leader of rare ability.
