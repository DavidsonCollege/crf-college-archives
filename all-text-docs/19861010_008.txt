An Illusion

In the strawberry field

wild flowers grew here and there

the bees were busily doing their work
carrying their burden

from one flower to another

The silence was not broken by children playing

or cars honking

or anything unhuman

except one sound -

the sound of a body in the last stages of its death throes

Walking Hand in Hand

Walking with my brother, stones
pressed into the tender flesh
of our feet; we walked
on the soft side of
the road. His sword fell
“on my brother’s throat, he
did not cry. Dusk cloaked
me inthe mourning: arms of night
as I knelt over my ©
brother’s carcass. | finished my mother’s errand.
I always walk on the
other side of the road.

JULY 4TH

Dancing fire darts between stars, drawing
Awe from all eyes, then, splitting the
Expectant silence, bespeaks ears with alto and ~~~
Tenor thunder. White, red, blue blooms —
Burst in the black, shedding petals like ' ae
Flaming tears from weeping suns.
Children “Oooh” from gaping mouths, their
Little hearts thumps double-time and silver
Light sparks in their eyes, echoing each
Magic hue. Men and women stand, shout,
Straight, goose bumps flooding every inch
Of skin while firework lightning flashes
In their souls, brimming breasts with
Patriotic pride. Skyward surging, multicolored
Fewer in the grand finale suicide near

stars, with a crashing crescendo
Imitating war, raining liquid lightdrops like *;:
Arcwelders. And through every sinew, every soul,
Every heart of Americana watching, whirl grandeous
Feelings of God given glory.

"H. Glenn Fogle ’88

band party : 3 a.m.

steeped in sweat.
and smoky swirls
of alcoholic exhales
our eyes catch —

but, hell you’re

too drunk to know.

Transcendental Ennui

Trains slipping out of station

out of town passing outward.

bound for skyscrapers and fields

sitting in this car whose lifespan

I niether care nor wonder with tea in my hand.

Trains rolling over iron tracks

that glitter with black soot

and wooden planks that burn’

when cigarettes are left behind

but I have carried a pail of water with me.

City just ahead

the fields do not take long to leave ©
though they were green and gold
and the wind loved them

Tam happy to be home.

Who Will Wake The Dead
The night is here again.

Was itever gone? _
Alone I sit; the world is dead,

And I, I cannot sleep

For if I do, who will wake the dead?

Who will make the world real again?

Oh God! The night is here again.
‘The endless task streches out before me;
Fear paralyzes me, and my stomach sickens.

Does everyone really sleep? _ af i =

If only they would waken! : me a
But alas someday they won't.
