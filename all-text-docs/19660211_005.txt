.. LIKE THE MAGNOLIAS’

On the masthead of the Wake Forest school news-
paper, the Old Gold and Black, is superimposed the
motto of the Wakie Weekly “Covers the Campus Like
the Magnolias.”

Some people on the staff of the OG&B (as the local
lingo of Baptist U. calls it} seem to have. stuck their.
heads out from under the magnolias tand heaven only
knows where the ‘magnolias are at Wake Forest that
could. cover the campus of any school) and taken the
initiative to rub a little salt into the wounds of last
week's somewhat less-than-pleasant run of luck for
Davidson basketball fortunes.

Such a hardnosed reporter must be Associate Sports
Editor Bill Nelson, of Co Editors Caro] Ciaxon and
Sherry Pryor’s OG&B.

' }'m not at all sure what Billy means by his letter.
Perhaps it’s a personal attack on me (note “sports
writer Bill Briggs!), or an attack on Coach Driesell,
or on THE DAVIDSONIAN, or on our schedule, or the
Southern Conference, or our basketball team; quite
frankly, 1 just don’t know what it is.

Mr. Nelson must take my column too seriously if
he believes everything he implies in the following let-
ter, but I like his spunk so I’m giving the boy a chance
to go big-time this week .. .

Dear Editor:

Weil, it looks as if the Israelites have defeated the mighty’
Philistines again.

In the words of THE DAVIDSONIAN sports writer Bill
Briggs, “Even lasi week another David was hurling a rock
into the eye of a Goliath. For another white-legged, scrawny,

a Ee en _ eee
« . ve

little kid, a 98 pound weakling rose oul of the sea somewhere .

in Maryland (North Carolina, this lime) and stalked a new
bully, striking him a death blow . . a

Actually, the outcome of the Wake-Davidson game Jast week
came almost as much of a surprise to us as did the result of
the [first game of the season, but we certainly could not con-
sider it ‘‘a fluke’ as did Mr. Driesell following the first game.
But, in view of the publicity which both. teams have received
in recent weeks (mostly through your own newspaper) we have
found it virtually mandatory to add our own remarks at your
expense.

After reading much of the information concerning your bas-
ketball team, it appears to us that some writers consider the
Wildcats to be an unapproachable animal which completely
devours all smafler animals but somehow, through some sched:
ulng “‘fluke’” manages to frighten away any larger animals
whicb attempt to infringe upon its rights as ruler of the king
dom.

But, according to Mr. Briggs, this title of ruler of the roost
is forgotten each year as the Wildcats “prove their kindness
once each year in a senscless neighborhood free for all when
they let the fellows who used to trounce him bring back old
times by beating up on him again."

Oh, the irony of it all. Here is the “Robin Hood, Superman,
Hercules, Lyndon Johnson all rolled into one’ which suddenly
turns benefactor in order to give the peasants a chance. Indeed,
Ahis appears to be the only fationalization out of this dilemma

which seeins 10 plague the Wildcats each ‘year. We were glad

to see, however, that you did choose to call those losses to us
as upsets rather than gifts for there is some consolation there.

But whatever they were, we have still found Davidson to be
that oasis in the desert for which many smaller animals look
when they cannot lind enough water to keep alive. For after
that opening game victory, we were beginning to feel like that
“98 pound weakling’’ of which you spoke. Within the space of
one month, we had lost twice to the nation’s number one ranked
team, Duke, and dropped single games to St. Josephs, Vander-
bilt and Cincinnati, ranked among the top ten teams last week

However, all was not losi—ib was almost time to play the
Wildcats again. Since we were deeply mired in last place in the
ACC, who would suspect that Davidson would have anything
but an easy time—especially when they are wying so hard “‘lo
show the nation’s skeptics that we deserve a national ranking.”

But everyone says, “look at the record, look at the games
the Wildcats have won.’ Yes, Davidson does have a fine record.
But what ACC team wouldn't have if it were able to play all its
games against Southern Conference teams? We wil turn to the
record for further evidence. This year, the SC has done better
than in many previous years against ACC competition, winning
five while dropping ten. However, the SC margins of victory
have totalled 45 points while the ten losses have been by a
margin of 208 points.

Of course, Davidson has not helped in this inter-league riv-
alry as far as the SC is concerned this year, and it is probably
a good thing they haven't played ‘“*good"’ teams since they have
lost both their games to the cellar dwellers. On the basis of this,
we wonder how you can consider yourself as **29 points better
than the nation’s number one team, Duke.”

Maybe you should try to prove your worth by scheduling
teams in the “upper echelon” of the ACC. But we keep forget-
ting, you would rather play Bucknell, Dartmouth and Ohio Un-
versity, etc. We do note with considerable relief «hat you have
scheduled St. Josephs and NYU in coming games. This is defi-
nitely a turn in the right direction. If St. Josephs is still nation-
ally ranked by the time you play them, it will defnitely en-
hance your chances for a national ranking if you could beat
them.

It is only by playing teams of this calibre (and beating them)
that you can consider yourself as worthy of that national rank-
ing—not by playing your conference teams which in all proba-
bility will never be ranked nationally. We realize that you are
forced to play those games within your conference, but we do
hope that it is with good intentions that Mr. Driesell has said.
“We'll play anybody, anytime, anyplace.’ lt is true, that while
your record will not be outstanding after playing some top-
ranked teams, at least you will find out how to play under pres-
sure. You seem to have had trouble with Wake as well as your
own conference teams when the chips are down, and we hope
you will not find it convenient to allow your kindness to show
forth again in the ‘senseless neighborhood free-for all.”

We at Wake Forest and those at other schools around the
ACC would like to see if you really are 29 points better than

the Duke Blue Devils.
Sincerely,

Bill Nelson,
Associate Sports Editor

THE DAVIDSONIAN

Blair Quits ’Cats

For Colorado U.

, By K. D. WEEKS
Davidsoriian Sports Writer

Coach Ken Blair. an outstanding element of_ this
year's “New Look” in Davidson football, returned Mon-
day to the University of Colorado, his alma-mater, whose
freshman team he coached before coming to Davidson.

“He couldn't afford to turn it
down, in fact. he was tickled to
get back to Colorado where he
was before,” commented Coach
Tom Couch. “But he’s a great.
guy and.we hate to see him go.”

Sai@ Coach Homer Smith con-
cerning the departure, ‘We.
were. of course. very surprised

jand disappointed. for it was on

very short notice. that he left.
Bot 1 accept the fact that. it was
a question of his Alma Mater
and more money, and he had no
choice. In this profession, mov-
ing is part of it.”

The coaching staff. which in
cidentally threw several going
away parties for -him, is left
with Blair's offensive line coach-
position to fill. “He did an out-
standing job ‘in thaf position.”

Scott. In his new capacity in
Colorado. Blatr will start im-
mediately. recruiting and help
ing to build for next year. His
recruiting assignment there will
probably be the ‘state of New
Mexico as it was prior to com-
ing to Davidson.

He Was praised and admired.
‘by players and coaches alike.
AS one player mused, “He was
what you might call a ‘rough’
coach, we all liked him but hat

‘ed to see him come to practice

because we knew he demanded
that little.extra. He was always

fhe first-to say ‘give me one

more. hit him again’ during a
particular drill." Another com
mented, “he’s a tough man him
self, hescommanded a. lot of re
spect among the boys but he's a
lot of Tun, too."

IMAC Basketball
Drags On Slowly

In spite of the absence

of some teams during the

week IMAC basketball continued in limited action.

In yesterday's close one, the
Betas could not make up for
their rebound disadvantage and
fell to the Phi Gamms, 62.56.
Johnny Little pumped in 15

paced the Betas with 14. The
game featured a half-court, run

trodden Pikas. The Sigma Chis
