ELumanean originally held two
meetings weekly, one devoted to
debate and the other to literary
composition and speeches. The’
avowed purposes of the society
were and are today to cultivate
potential literary ability and to
develop the art of oratory.

In olden days these lofty ideals
were taken so much to heart that
the Society played a role subser-

NSA SPONSORS SEMINARS ON ROLE

OF STUDENTS IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS

Most of the people who read
this article will be unfamiliar with
the concept of international stu-
dent relation, because they will be
more or less unaware of the
existence and activities of the rep-
resentative student organizations
whose relationships with one an-
other are described by the term
“international student relations.”

Realizing this state in student
thinking in this country, the Unit-
ed States National Student As-
sociation is sponsoring educational
seminars in each of the NSA dis-
tricts across the country to point
up the role of students in inter-
national affairs today. The Caro-
lina-Virginia Region’s seminar was

held at the Woman's College of | Music
the University of North Carolina ' Physics
24-26 February, with Jack Kerr) Psychology
and Phil Kukura representing! Spanish

Davidson.

It is difficult for the American
student to appreciate the import-
ance of the role of students in
other countries, particularly in the
newer nations of Asia, Africa and
Latin America. Where American
students comprise almost ten per
cent of. the nation’s population,
these foreign students may be less
than one per cent.

Being far fewer, these students
upon graduation are immediately
called to high positions of leader-
ship in their countries’ govern-
ments. Staggering responsibilities
of their nation’s future lie on these
former students, who are just a
few years older than the average
American college senior.

In order to capture the minds
of the students in these newly-re-
born countries the Communists,
are spending sixty million dollars
annually thru their International
Union of Students operating out
of Prague.

The students of the free world
are leagued together in the inter-
national Student Conference,
which in the five years of its life
has undertaken a very active role
in bringing the students of the
world together for better under-
standing of common and special
student problems,

Programs of student travel have
been arranged in which special
tours, lodgings and services are
set up at the economic level at
which they are able to travel. Stu-
dent health programs for tuber-
culosig and other diseases have
been implemented thru World
University Services. Exchange pro-
grams for students to study in

foreign countries, have been
worked out.
Participation in interna-

tional student affairs is not
limited to seminars or inter-
national conferences. Every

foreign student in this country
is a representative of his own
nation, and as such American

students can take advantage
of opportunities offered them
by these students to. better
understand other peoples of
the world. And with the strug-
gle between the communists
and the West gripping our
thinking, it should be remem-
bered that these students,
while studying in America,
are gaining an ‘impression of
this country which will guide
them in the future when they
are leading their countries.
