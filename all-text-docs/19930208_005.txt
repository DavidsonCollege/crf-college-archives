women, house members, indepen-
dents, and minorities. Mary
Katherine Gregory, a member of
the committee, said that the re-
stricted number of weekday par-
ties is “putting a barrier on our
freedom.” Alice Spivey, also a
member of the committee, agreed
that students “should be able to
have that flexibility.”

The positive results reported
by the SGA Ad-Hoc committee,
which included Patterson Court
Advisor, Kurt Holmes, mentioned
the elimination of hard liquor from
“open” court parties. According to
Spivey, Holmes serves as a “nice
liaison between Dean Terry and
the houses on the court.” The
committee agreed that the hard li-
quor ban has stopped students from
unintentionally becoming over-in-
toxicated by grain alcohol punch.

Having addressed the positive
and negative results of the alcohol

policy, the SGA Ad-Hoc commit- .

tee made recommendations to
make changes. They suggested
new formats of the alcohol policy
and for alcohol education, student

cup rule for legal drinkers to be
able to exit with two beverages,
and the elimination of weekday
party restrictions.

The committee hopes that the
amendments to the alcohol policy
will stop drunk driving that has
been a result of students going off
campus to “party.” Catherine
Turner, member of the committee,
said, ““We’re not in Boston where
we can walk back from abar.” The
committee also hopes thatchanges
will stop students from “slamming”
hard liquor in their rooms due to
the lack of opportunity to drink
socially on the court.

The full report by the SGA
Ad-Hoc committee will be re-
viewed by Dean Terry and the
Council for Campus and Religious
Life who will then make recom-
mendations to the Trustees of the
college. The Trustees will then
approve or reject the changes in
April. According to Edmonston,
changes, if approved, will beimple-
mented in the fall of ‘93.

‘ Edmonston said, “I feel that
this [the report] represents what
the students want. No matter what
happens, this represents a lot of
work- if nothing else, the policy
will be clearernextyear.” Gregory
said, “We worked really hard on
the report and we hope something
will come out of it.”

Anthony Foxx made his final
Trustee address. He discussed in-
clusiveness oncampusand the need
for anew college union. He intro-
duced his successor, Alden Smith.

Smith said, “Anthony has
paved the way for increased com-
munication between students and
the Trustees."
