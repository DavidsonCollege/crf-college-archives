Friendship And Sportsmanship
It has been said by a man of subtle wit that the differ-
ence between Harvard and Princeton is that at Harvard
the students have private bathrooms and don’t get to meet
anybody. Perhaps Woodrow Wilson took with him from
Davidson a bit of the friendly spirit. Whether he did or
not, Davidson remains a source of the cheerful and the
sportsmanlike. New and visiting students almost always
comment on this atmosphere, and the returning veteran is
glad to receive a smile rather ‘than a scowl.

Nowhere is the attitude more evident than at basketball
games in that ancient, tottering ruin which serves as the
gym. It makes a Davidsonian mighty proud to hear ap-
plause at the skill of a visiting player, and silence prevail-
ing when the opposition attempts a foul shot, Unlike the
spectator in many larger schools, where the student body
is half feminine, most of them girls, and the officials as
well as visiting players can expect little mercy for en-
dangering the home team’s.chances, the Wildcat supporter
usually views a gajne as a Contest and not a battle. Let's
keep it that way. Sic transit gloria latrina.

Scholarships Pay Off!

Don’t be surprised if the Wildcat footballers number
among their members some of the more sought after high
‘school luminaries of this part of the country. There's de-
finitely an upward trend in local athletics, for Norfolk
and Memphis provided a top-notch source and the future
elevens hold heralded promise of being well-groomed. The
pressure for open alumni support of Davidson is reaping
be efits, and the return of prewar stars bodes evil for the
Wildcat’s adversaries.

Don’t overlook the fact that the R.O.T.C. Rifle team
garnered fourth place laurels at the recent Hearst Trophy
meet, which isn’t bad at all, considering the fact that six-
teen teams competed. P: osieg to the sharp of eye and steady
of finger. May Mr. Hearst’provide another trophy for the
anteroom of Chambers. That last one is quite impressive.

New Glory

A brand new football dated. 1946 and marked with a
Davidson victory over North Carolina would surely look
good in that showcase. Those dust covered replicas of the
Cats prowess at the turn of the century aren't too in-
spiring, nor impressive. It’s been a long time since David-
son toppled one of the Big Five into the throes of defeat,
although State was tied in 1941. Perhaps revenge will
have to wait, perhaps not. It may come in another field,
and a likely possibility lies in the tennis team. With one of
the country’s foremost tutors in Bill, Lufer and several
vets back, victory may be shortcoming. And as an added
threat; George Ennett, the Montreat Menace, has acknow-
ledged that he may be available for service this year. With
the publication of this startling news the entire sports

world will probably shake in a storm of upheaval, and

Adults Only signs-may appear in local athletic circles.
Touche!
