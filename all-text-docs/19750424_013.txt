afternoon in Charleston, S.C., - But Davidson had better luck
to enter theconference tour- in the fourth, fifth and sixth
nament on a good note. singles where the Cats got third

The tournament, which is
being played on the Bulldogs’
home courts, got underway
Thursday, with Appalachian
going in as the favored team to
capture their second straight
Southern Conference crown.

A question mark for the
tourney is. the status of
Mountaineer standout Keith
Richardson. The veteran
performer recently turned an
ankle against UNC-Charlotte,
ending his winning string at 99
successive matches. Richard-
son will play in the tourney, but
appears to be hampered
somewhat by the “injury: Of
further significance is the fact
that John Garratty, the number
two player for the Apps, turned
an ankle in pre-tournament
practice at the Citadel late
Wednesday. He will also play,
but may not be performing at
top level for the event.

Davidson head coach Jeff
Frank has had optimistic ideas
about the season-ending finale.
His most important rationale is
that the tourney will be played
on clay, the type of surface
which Davidson uses for their
home matches. Appalachian
and several other conference
schools compete primarily on
hard courts, which should put
them at a disadvantage this
weekend.

Frank was also pleased with
the tournament seedings, which
were finalized by the annual

seeds. Mike Barnhill, Stuart
Boswell and Steve Holman fill
those three spots in that order.

The top doubles has Quinby
and Boswell seeded sixth, which
is one of the tougher seedings
for the Cats. Bondurant and
Barnhill are ranked fourth at
the second doubles. But the best
seeding came at the third
doubles where Mitchell and
Greg Dunn are seeded second in
that slot.

Frank felt that the seedings
were exceptionally good, noting
that the Cats are in particularly
good shape at the fourth, fifth
and sixth singles and the second
doubles. ;

About the third doubles,
Frank mentioned that this was
the best chance the Cats had for
a first place finish, although the
chances at other spots are not
disastrous. “

‘Another thing of importance
is that Furman and Ap-
palachian are set to hit each
other in several key semifinal
matches. If they can knock each
other off in a couple places, then
we are certainly going to be in
the thick of things.”

Frank was quick to em-
phasize that the Cats received
very good draws a year ago and
relaxed in the first round, which
proved very costly.

“I warned the boys about this
and I think they are mentally
ready to play,” Frank pointed
out, adding, ‘and I know they

are ready physically.”

Quinby got things started off
right against the Bulldogs by
taking a come-from-behind win
over Mike Martin in the number
one singles. After dropping the
first set, the Davidson senior
came roaring back to capture
the victory by a score of 5-7, 6-4,
6-1.

Bondurant came through in
the second singles position with
ease as he waltzed by Tommy
Bunch 6-3, 6-1. Sandy
Haltiwanger snapped the Cat
string in the singles as he took
the number three match from
Mitchell, 6-4, 6-4.

Barnhill topped Jon Foshee,
6-2, 7-5; Boswell nailed Mal
Atkins, 6-3, 6-1; and Holman
bopped Bill Ohlandt, 6-1, 6-1 in
the fourth, fifth and sixth slots
respectively.

Doubles activity started off
poorly for the Cats as they lost
the two position with Martin and
Bunch teaming for.a-6-7, 6-3, 7-5
win over Quinby and Boswell.
But Bondurant and Barnhill
demolished Haltiwanger and

Foshee by a score of 6-1, 6-2 in

the second doubles. Dunn joined
Holman to climax the match for
Davidson as they trounced
Ohlandt and Atkins in the third
doubles slot by a score of 6-2, 6-
4.

Frank was pleased with the

team’s performance in the.

victory. He felt that even in the
losing efforts, the players
played good, solid tennis and
appeared ready for the tour-
nament.

Earlier in the week the Cats
had taken an 8-1 drumming at

the hands of South Carolina. In |

that match on Monday, Brian
Cooper was the only winner for
Davidson as he bested Mason
Legard,7-5, 6-4. The loss came
after the Davidson squad had
ripped VMI by a score of 9-0 on
Saturday.
