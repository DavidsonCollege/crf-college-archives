B& BB are athletic supporters

By BONEHEAD

THE BRICK BROTHERS

Memorandum to: All people
at Davidson except members of
that peripatetic (B&BB note:
Hellno, we don’t get tired of
this word) SGA committee that
made up that absurdly asinine
sports poll. Re: That ‘absurdly
asinine sports poll.

The other day B&BB, with a
little help from X&Z, and some
prodding from T,I,H,&S, put
their heads together to analyze
that sports poll that appeared
on page two of your Jaunuary
24 issue of The Davidsonian.
With a little research, including
some reading in Bob Lapple’s
greatest humes papers, among
them ‘‘A Study of Gay Porcu-
pines in South East Asia” and
“The Effects of Parallel Phallic
Symbols,’’ we’ve come up with
this analysis. ;

SGA Poll— Part I
Agree or disagree with the
“foRowing inane statements.

t) The proportion of SGA
Sports GPA committees at
Davidson (0.4158% of the male
student population) is unheal-
thy for campus life.

2) The way in which Coke
machines are placed in the
dorms endangers the privileges
made possible by the honor
code.

3) The absence of Penthouse on
microfilm is detrimental to the
high academic standards of the
College.

4) As an alumnus I would give
less money if I had less money
to give and couldn’t get a whole
lot out of my savings account
without paying a substantial
penalty for early withdrawal.
5) Price Zimmerman with an
afro would be beneficial to the
school’s image.

6) I would favor instituting
athletic supporters for women.
7) I would have come to
Davidson even if Jon Lawry
wasn’t here.

8) The existence of absurdly
asinine SGA committees is a
positive factor in recruiting
students.

9) Pernicious membranes help
unify the student body at
Davidson.

19) Davidson’s SGA commit-
tees counterbalance an other-

wise ‘‘well-rounded’’ student
body.

PART II
For Rich DiBenedetto’s black
satin shirts, Davidson spends
too much —or—too little
For the Coffee and Cokes guest
lecture series, Davidson spends
too much—or—too little

For research grants on herma-
phroditic porcupines, Davidson
spends

too much—or—too little

PART III
A special B&BB extra on how
to figure out (ed. note: accord-
ing to the Roget's Thesaurus, to
figure is synonymous with to
distort) combined athletic’s
GPA’s: First take the team’s
batting average (substitute zero
if no batting average) and
divide that by points per game
and then add in the yards per
carry, then take the standard
derivation of total jock size and
multiply by Ed Farrell’s toupee
size. (For girls substitute the
average weight of the women’s
field hockey team, which usual-
ly comes out to be somewhere
between 170 and 190 pounds.)

Now we move on to that
which‘We have neglected for the
last few weeks—that is IMAC
basketball. ‘

In the peripatetic women’s
league Almost Heaven (West
Virginia) beat the Carnegie
Endowment 17-9 as Erin
“Chester’’ Orr hit the clincher,
waking up the other nine girls
on the court.

In B league there were lots of
games with the SPE’s losing
more often than not. Some
Fiji’s are doing well and are the
early season B league favorites.
Doug Ziedonis plays for them
and he tells us there are other
players on the team. The Blue
Jazz win a lot but have a SPE
on the team and as such aren’t
worth mentioning. Captain
Jack’s, last year’s runner-up
lost Bart Landess and aren’t
doing a thing this year. Kelvin
scored 103 points last Sunday in
a tough loss.

In A league Fido and the
Rear Entries (Pat’s clowns for
short) remain in the number one
spot. They’ve beaten all the
mediocre teams they’ve played.
Cool Breeze had one scare form
The Guns of Navaronne but
have survived with a perfect
record. Hurtin 4 Certin, with
the incomparable Minor Sinclair
and the very comparable Joby
Merten, are also perfect.

In two big games We Know
We're Peripatetic beat the Old
Men by one point and drilled
the Guns of Navaronne.
Wheels, Ricky, Hill, and Bur-
ton did well in both games.

The Brick Layers. are still
winning. True Grits, a bunch of
freshmen, mutilated the PiKas.
The Old Men remained tough
when the goon squad of Bieden-

A nice place to meet people!
A complete line of imported beer!

bach, Barnes, and Bzdelik made
the scene. Unfortunately they
have.developed the knack of
losing close games. OSFD and
Corpus Cavernosum remain in
the Top Ten since there are no
other good teams in the league.

Let’s take a quick scan of the
five worst A league teams:
#1-the SPE’s. Actually there
are no SPE teams in A league,
but they are still the worst.
#2-Airborne-this team is the
true testimonial that only black
drug addicts can play basket-
ball.
#3-Face the Nation-Although
they are too embarrassed to
name themselves the PiKA’s-
they are the PiKA’s-and they
always lose.
#4-Norton’s Heads-The worst
freshman team in the country.
#5-DUML-Yates and Roger are
OK, but this team wouldn’t
even win B league.

Pandora’s Box, Jay Gepfert,
and Harry Griffith. Later.
