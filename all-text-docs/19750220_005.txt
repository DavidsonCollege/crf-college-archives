To the Editor:

Thursday morning at 2°a.m.
Addison and I boarded the train
for Andorra.

It was 5 a.m. in the second-
class waiting room in Per-
pignan with a businessman who
thought we were nuts talking
and laughing, and a beautiful
dark-skinned dark-haired
woman with a child, who boar-
ded the same ‘connection to
Latour-Carol but got off a stop
earlier in Font-Frede.

By 9 a.m. we were eating
bread and butter and warming
up with hot chocolate at the
“Gare Internationale’ in
Latour.

No busses to Andorra.

So we walked the 114 kms. to
town only to find that the

nearest ski station is 13 kms.

Still thinking of getting to An-
dorra somehow, we began
walking to Spain. Someways
down a Pyrenees farm road we
encountered the Spanish border
control: two men ina hut.

One of them wanted to see my
bag. After a brief inspection
revealed only a book of Rim-
baud’s poetry, a French-

Torque Increas

I have been an Elder in the
First Church of the Automobile
for some time but seldom have I
seen such concern for the state
of the nation and the world as
was evident in our last meeting.

Now, my church has always
believed in tolerance. Witness
the fact that we have allowed
the horse to exist long after the
automobile took its place. We
have even refrained from
collisions with those little cars
(cars with less than a 350 cubic
inch engine displacement).

While we tolerate these moral
midgets we see a weakening in
the moral fiber of the country.
In the days of moral fervor we
watched with deep satisfaction
the replacement of national
monuments with parking lots.

Of course today’s weaklings
may. disagree,. but there has
been nothing more moving, to

English dictionary, a flannel
shirt, white socks, and an alarm
clock, the nice man calculated
shrewdly that Addison and I
were no grave threats to the dic-
tatorship, and let us pass.

So, about noon, at the end of
our 5 km. jaunt, we found that
haven of havens:Puigcerda. If
we take the 1 a.m. bus to An-
dorra, we can’t get out until
next morning.

Back to Latour. We cross the
border once again.

I walk around the right side of
the border barrier--having
come in on the same side, en-
tering a leftist, I walk out of
Spain a rightist. France, has
had a great influence on me.

We top and sit on the other
side. The snow-capped moun-
tains surround us, and a stream
dominates the atmosphere with
its rushing.

Along the tracks to the ‘‘Gare
Internationale”. There is a
train leaving for the Port
Puymorens skistationat2. .

By 3:30 I am on the slopes (for

hard time and I am going to be
late if I try to ski the rest of the
way down.

These are dark days, who

This has always been a coun-

To the Editor:

I wish to clarify a statement
which I made that appeared in
the February 6 Davidsonian.

In my report to the SGA
Senate concerning Psychologi-
cal Counseling I stated that Dr.
Workman had seen only seven
people this term.

remember his pioneer instincts.

We would hate to come to war
with the Arab states. But
remember oil is thicker than

put out bumper stickers saying:
‘‘Honk if you love Torque.”’

Letter To The Editor

Rats Monopolize

To the Editor;

Hello there! I’m one of, those
deprived fellows who lives off
campus. I have no complaints,
mind you. It was my choice
where I live, and I certainly
prefer it that way.

You ‘know, I’ll admit I’m
somewhat of a country boy, a

Jittle red around the neck and
all, but where I come from the

people seem to have a good deal
of consideration for one
another.

Seeing as how it’s such a
ruckus for me to be scootin’
back and forth to the library all
the time with my books, I
generally do most of my
studying at home.

But as usually happens, once
or twice per term even I must
depend on E.H.Little and his
vast. amount’ of bound
knowledge in order to write a
paper.

So I gather up my things,
strap on my wings and ping

These figures were based
only on the report for the month
of December and did not in-
clude those for the month of
January (these were not
available at the time).

Dr. Workman saw 18 students
in December and January.

This is in light of the fact that
he was on leave all of the first
term.

E.H. Little Carrels

over to the library to be a fly.

The trouble is that when I get

there, there seems to be no

place for me to light. I mean the

carrels are all cluttered with.
garbage—not people but gar-

bage. So as a rule I end up

spreading out at a table with

three or four other people, two

of whom invariable know each>
other and insist on carrying on a

conversation. .

Now I’ve walked around the
library and observed. It seems
to me that many students are
leaving books in the carrels just
to reserve their places. there
and even though they may not
be working at the time, their
carrel will be available when
something comes up and they
need it.

Please don’t get me wrong. I
understand that there is often a
need to take over a carrel for a
few days or even for a week
maybe, but I’m convinced there
are students who do this for a
whole term.

Personally I think that would
be great, if there were just
twelve-hundred carrels in the

“ library, but there are not.

Now, having hopefully made
things clearer, I see just two
solutions to the problem:

1)that the college buy more of
those little study-desks for us to
use (and I think we all realize
the absurdity of that solution)

2) for those guilty persons to
alleviate’ the problem by
vacating the premises. (In
other words, pack up your ster-
no stoves, roll up your sleeping
bags and get out). I got some
wood to chop.

“Hot Spots,
‘Hot Pots, and
Big Daddy’s

By BOB ENRIGHT
And MARK YOW

One of the new and few additions to the coveted catalog of
culinary hot-spots in the Davidson locale is a restaurant known as
Big Daddy’s, located west of Mooresville on Lake Norman.

One of the new and few additions to the coveted catalog of
culinary hot-spots in the Davidson locale is a restaurant know as
Big Daddy’s, located west of Mooresville on Lake Norman.

Formerly known as the Chesapeake Oyster Bar, an eatery whose
neglected appearance long evinced a desire on my part to stop
there, Big Daddy’s is one of several chain restaurants of the same
name in the Carolinas. Though never having been to such spots of
legendary lore as Calabash, Morehead City, or Nags Head (just
give mea chance), I would have to say that the fare at Big Daddy’s
is the most palatable of its kind in this part of the state.

It’s also one place where you’ll wait in line for thirty minutes if
you don’t have reservations. How many places in Mooresville can
boast that? It at least makes you think there’s something worth

waiting for.

Fortunately for us we were ushered past countless customers
who preceeded us in line, and led to a secluded corner table from
which our eyes attacked the menu. Obviously those Davidson ID’s
did the trick, a note to Messrs. Jung of the House of Jung.

If you haven’t already figured it out, the specialty at Big Daddy’s
is seafood, and lots of it. A word of warning: \it is not your typical
all-you-can-eat-for-$2.25 southern-fried fish camp. Big Daddy’s
caters to more exclusive tastes offering such delicacies as deviled
crab, quahogs (stuffed clams), oysters in various forms (fried,
raw, or in cocktails, the kind you eat), and key lime pie which was
the best imitation of the real thing I’ve had for 50¢ (maybe it even

was the real thing).

The menu is quite extensive, and with a slip of the finger, ex-
pensive, too. Prices range from about $3.50 up (though you’d best
figure on about double that). Nobody went away hungry.

The food was quite good, right down to the ever-present fries and
slaw. Finally; thanks to the presence of John Guthrie and several
others, it -ranked as the first and only time all year we’ve en-
countered fellow Davidson students on‘a Saturday outing. You just

can’t keep a good thing quiet.
