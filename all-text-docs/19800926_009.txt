Key mistakes and penalties in
addition to a second half flurry
by Lafayette spelled doom for
Davidson this past Saturday as
the Wildcats were upset 27-20
in an away contest. Davidson
led 12-7 at the half, but the
Leopards drove 80 yards for a
touchdown following the se-
cond-half kickoff and scored
again less than two minutes
later after a Wildcat fumble
deep in Davidson territory.

Davidson scored on its first
two possessions of the game
and outgained Lafayette in
total offense 378 yards to 295
yards, but the Cats coughed up
the football on two key occa-
sions and were flagged 75 yards
in penalties compared to no
penalties for Lafayette.

Soccer shuts out Wilson and Marshall, meets UT-C

By STEVE SOUD
Staff Correspondent

The soccer team, described as
up and coming, looks as if it is
already here. Two convincing
wins over Warren Wilson and
Marshall have left the Wildcats
with a 4-0 record and a goalie
that is unscored-upon.

Freshman wing Chris Rob-
erts spearheaded an abusive 5-0
win over Warren Wilson getting
his second hat trick of the
season. Roberts, who played
last year on a less-than-average
high school team in upstate

New York, ‘‘was just hoping to
get a goal this season.”
' Roberts had already scored
one goal when, on a free kick, he
placed a head shot by the
Wilson goalie after 31:00 of
play. ‘‘That head shot was one
of the prettiest shots I’ve ever
seen,’’ marveled first-year
coach Charlie Slagle. Roberts
finished off the hat trick after
six minutes of second half play,
and Alex McCallie and Hall
Barnett put the finishing
touches on the shutout.

The win over Marshall, Dav-
idson’s conference victim, star-

ted rolling early, as Peter
Brown scored on a corner kick
after 34 seconds of action. The
Cat kickers added an insurance
goal as Robert rifled a shot later
in the first half. Junior goalie
Mike Iordanou, again stifled
the opposing offense with a
shining cage performance. Ior-
danou tallied five saves, in-
cluding a spectacular one-on-

_one stop.

A stingy defense has been
another major factor in the
Wildcat success. The backfield
is spearheaded by Doug Robin-
son, who works with Chris

Moore (the only senior on the
starting squad), Mark Elmore,
and Ben Dishman. They rarely
get beaten on breaks because
“They position well.”

A solid Davidson soccer team
is realistically fighting for se-
cond, with the major goal in
mind to win the one point losses
of last year. Winning the one
point losses would yield a vastly
improved record.over last year,
but more than that, it will be
crucial if Davidson is to take
Southern Conference laurels.
Appalachian State stands head
and shoulders above the rest,
and only a “huge upset’’ would
unseat them. Coach Slagle
won't discount an upset
though.

The team takes on UT-Chat-
tanooga Saturday at 2:00, with
a prelim between area high
school rivals Charlotte Country
Day and Northside Christian to
begin at noon. The season gets
tough Wednesday, though,
when the Cats take on long-time
nemesis the Citadel here at
3:30. The Apps come in October
11 at 2:00.

The season and soccer team
are young, but as long as
Roberts, Iordanou and com-
pany can keep up their pace, DC
soccer will have arrived.

Lafayette upsets Cats

The Wildcats struck quickly
in the opening quarter as Brian
Whitmire found tight end
James Jones for a 70 yard
scoring strike. The PAT was
unsuccessful. Lafayette boun-
ced back quickly, however, with
a sustained drive and led 7-6
after the extra point. The Cats
responded with a drive of their
own, climaxed by fullback Ray
Sinclair’s 31 yard touchdown
jaunt. Coach Ed Farrell opted
for the two point conversion
attempt, but a Whitmire pass
was incomplete and the Wild-
cats settled for a 12-7 advant-
age which stood unit] half time.

Early in the third period
Lafayette ground out an 80
yard drive for the go-ahead
score and Davidson never re-
gained the lead. Less than a
minute later the Leopards re-
covered a Wildcat fumble in
excellent scoring position and
chalked up their second score of
the half with 9:20 remaining in
the third quarter.

The home-standing Leopards
scored’on a three yard run
before Davidson could rally.
Ray Sinclair cut the margin to
27-20 (the two point conversion
was good) on a one yard run, his
second touchdown effort of the
afternoon. Sinclair’s fourth
quarter score was as close as the
Wildcats would come however,
and the final score read 27-20.

Overshadowing the Cats sta-
tistical advantage were crucial

. mistakes. Two lost fumbles in

addition to a 15 yard penalty
which kept a Lafayette drive
going stymied the Davidson
cause. Also, a stronger Lafay-
ette rush in the second half
often hurried Brian Whitmire
limited the Davidson junior to
only five completions after in-
termission. Whitmire’s overall
statistics were impressive how-
ever, as he completed 13 of 22
passes for 225 yards. The
Lafayette victory also oversha-
dowed our other strong perfor-
mance on the part of Ray
Sinclair. Sinclair scored twice
against the Leopards and
picked up 114 yards on 17
carries for his second straight
100 yards-plus week. (Incident-
ally, Sinclair entered the game
as the leading scorer in Division
IAA.)
