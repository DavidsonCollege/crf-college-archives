Budget Cuts-

(Continued from page 1)
“The problem is that students as yet don’t realize the
impact,” Peyser said, ‘‘They’re going to be hurt.”

UNCC Chancellor and chairman of the American ©

Council on Education E.K. Fretwell told CPS that the

cuts would limit ‘‘choice for prospective students’”’ and

“research capacity, which is an irreplaceable national

resource.’’ They would also “raise operating costs at a

time when the financial conditions” of colleges are
“particularly uncertain,’ Fretwell added.

College President Samuel Spencer said the proposals
would not have a large effect on Davidson's
institutional finances, however. ‘The extent to which
any institution will be hit by the proposed cuts will be
in direct ratio to its dependence on federal aid...and our
dependence compared to many institutions is relatively
small,” Spencer said.

The increase in postal costs resulting. from reduction
in federal mail subsidies would cost the College an extra

$700 monthly, according to Central Service Secretary
Jane Biggestaff, since 90 percent of Davidson’s mail is
first class.

According to the March 16 Chronicle, Reagan's
budget proposals would eliminate a $5 million program
of grants for college libraries. They also call for a 50

‘percent cut in funds for the National Endowment for

the Humanities (NEH). Davidson currently has a
$500,000 NEH challenge grant.

Acting Vice President for Development Julius
Melton said Davidson has already received $275,000 of
the three year challenge grant, which stipulates that
the College raise $1.5 million to be awarded the total
$500,000 grant.

The grant is ‘‘contingent on funds being appropriat—
ed year to year,” Melton said, but he feels that instead
of cutting back on already awarded funds, NEH would
award fewer new grants in the future.

The grant money goes into the College’s endowment,

Melton explained. Income from the endowment is used
for College expenses. If the grant were taken away, “‘it
would be equivalent to preventing the purchase of 600
library books a year,”’ Melton said.

Budget cutbacks may "indirectly reduce research
activities” of professors because there will be less grant
money available to professors for summer study and to
supplement sabbatical income, Melton said. There are,
however, funds available from foundations and
non-government organizations, he added.

Spencer said the American Council on Education,
which has criticized Reagan’s proposals, would be
“foolish to oppose all cuts” in the education budget.

“It’s alarming to see how dependent society has
become” on the federal government, Spencer said, so
‘maybe it’s good...to be forced to take critical looks at
situations and see what we can do better.”

Sophomore Chip Hurley is
running unopposed for SGA
vice-president in next week’s
election.

Hurley said his main goals as
vice-president will be to pro-
mote more student involvement
in the SGA and to “assist the
president in any way I can.” He
will encourage students to at-
tend SGA meetings and to work
on various committees. He
would like more students to
serve on the Trustee Contact
Committee and the Corporate
Relations Committee.

Hurley has extensive SGA
experience. He was a freshman
class senator and is now presi-

dent of the. sophomore class. He

dining commons, the future of

‘ Richards and Bailey houses,

student input in faculty tenure
decisions, student parking, se-
curity, and housing.

Dorsett agreed thatLegerton
mentioned significant student
issues, but said that he thinks
the SGA should concentrate
more on projects. He said that
the student phonathon for the
Living Endowment should be
expanded and that he would like
to institute a managerial collo-
quium series similar to the pre-
medical colloquium program.
He would like for the Corporate
Contact Committee to be even
more active. He would also like
to increase faculty-student con-
tact by starting informal get
togethers in the College Union.

He added that job ‘placement for
seniors is a big student issue the

‘SGA should be involved in with

more and more students going
straight into the working world.

Legerton would like to see the
SGA become more involved in
student funding. He said that
student organizations tht do
not affect the whole campus
should be funded through the
SGA instead of the Activities
Tax Council (ATC) because the
SGA is more flexible. Dorsett:
said that he thinks the SGA
does not have time in its
meetings to take on funding of
student organizations.

Both candidates said that
SGA work of recent years has
greatly improved student-trus-
tee relations. SGA Trustee

sign-up dinners, the Trustee
Contact Committee, Trustee
cocktail parties, and especially
small meetings of concerned
students with trustees have
drawn students and trustees
together, they said.

Neither candidate advocates
opening Trustee meetings to
student observers or having a
voting student member on the
Board of Trustees. They both
said that the SGA president
needs to relate in depth each
meeting’s proceedings to the
students, however.

Dorsett is a history major
from Raleigh, North Carolina
and is an SAE. Legerton is a
premedicine major from Char-
leston,- South Carolina and a
KA.
