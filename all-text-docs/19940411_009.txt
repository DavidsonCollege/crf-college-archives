The Fourth Grade Syndrome

“T hate you.”

Those were the words scrawled on the leg of the little boy’s pants.
I stared at him for a moment and he averted my eyes.

“Who wrote that?”

I asked, confused.

“I did.” He replied matter-of-factly, a hint of sadness in his voice.
“Who did you write that.to2” I pushed the point.
“Myself. Because I hate myself.”

He is a ten-year-old fourth
grader whom I play. with every
.week. He makes A’s and B’s in

school, his favorite subject is math, -

he has a grin that is.wide and bright,
and he hates himself...

[tis knownas the Fourth Grade
Syndrome.. While. statistics na-
tionwide say we are losing black
men, it is.in this year that the prob-

’ lems begin. In fourth grade, learn-
ing becomes less active, children

begin to grow, and the intimida- .

tion of size becomes a factor.

Rudeness and
Irresponsibility

Lia week's Davidsonian in-
cluded an article by Lori Brown in

_ which she recounted the events of
one Saturday night when she was

awakened by some intoxicated °
Davidson students cavorting

around the senior apartments.
Although her noisy neighbors
were certainly rude and inconsid-
erate, Brown carries her argument
a bit too far. Lori felt that her rude
awakening (no pun intended) made
her a “victim of an irresponsibility
that invades all aspects of Davidson
life.” Besides this statement, she
also described the behavior of these
inebriated students as un-Chris-
tian and hypocritical, claiming that
they “had absolutely no right” to
keep her awake until 3:00 a.m.
Granted, the notorious perpe-
trators were acting inconsiderately,
but in a cohabitation environment
these unfortunate incidents occa-
sionally occur. It would be one
thing if we were talking about a
Tuesday during mid-term week,
but this was a Saturday night. If
the drunken revellers were so dis-
tuptive and ignored polite protests,
‘then the R.A. should defuse the

situation. Ms. Brown has a valid:

right to sleep, but comparing this

incident to some kind of rampant

irresponsibility eeaende the issue
beyond reason.

Let’s keep things more gown:

toearth: Rudeness does not consti- °
tute some terrible sickness eating
away at the moral fiber of this
campus. These noisy drunks were
rude, not an affront to the prin-
ciples on which ‘Davidson was
founded. :

If all parties involved were a

little more considerate of each
other, situations like this could be
avoided. Appropriate courtesies
Should be observed, but we all
know that this does not always
happen. In these instances we deal
with impoliteness--not a symbol .
of the decay. of Davidson’ s prin-
ciples.

I’m sorry Ms. Brown lost a
few hours of sleep some Saturday
night. However, if she feels that
life in the senior apartments is so.
disruptive, then she should try liv-
ing “down the hill” for a few days
and she would sleep like a baby for
evermore.

but the things that matter. are never
really easy.

We can sit around and debate
why America has become such an
endangered country with youth at
the point of destruction or we can

take steps towardschange and help —

start a movement towards some-
thing positive, no matter how small
our personal missions seem.
Most of us say we don’t have
the time. Time is limited but if we
were ever to see the destruction
closer to home, I’m sure we’d be-

gin to make the sacrifices to rem-.

edy the disaster. Why wait until
it’s our little brothers and sisters or
even our children to do something
positive? There shouldn’t be any

The Simpsons
and Christianity

War does the popular cartoon -
The Simpsons have to do with
Christianity, you may ask? (Oh
no, he’s trying to do it again. You
know, he wants to relate Christian-
ity to yet another realm of popular
culture.) Many Christians I know
are quick to point out how shows
such as The Simpsons, Beavis &
Butthead, and Married with Chil-
dren are the primary causes of the
breakdown of Western society.
Rather than condemning such
shows (okay, I finally realize that
Beavis & Buttheadisn’t that funny,
especially.after the four hundredth .

re-run), L enjoy watching them as

satire which points out what is —
really wrong with society. One
such example is an episode of The
Simpsons. °

In the episode, Homer
Simpson becomes friends with his
“Christian” neighbor Ned Flanders.
Some of the humorous stereotypes

| of Christianity include the Flanders

family satellite television with ev-
ery channel but the Bible network .
parentally locked out, and one of
the Flanders children telling his
self-justifying father that “lies
make baby Jesus cry.”

Another stereotype of Chris-
tianity which is humorous yet
alarming is the stereotype of self-

Tighteous, condemning Christians:

Ned Flanders is stopped by the
police who administer a sobriety
test to him. Of course, as this is
happening, his church bus drives
by and the people in the bus look
upon him with shock and indigna-
tion. The next day, when Ned and
his family go to church, he tells his
wife that church is “a place of love
and acceptance.” When Ned and
his family enter the sanctuary, ev-
eryone whispers comments such
as “pure evil” and “the fallen one.”
Finally, the service begins with the
minister’s sermon—“What Ned
did.”

The reason that this episode is
so humorous is because it mirrors
our society. How many times are
Christians, including me, more
concerned with the latest gossip or
with justifying ourselves than we
are concerned with helping and
loving people? How many times
do we look scornfully upon others
while justifying ourselves by say-
ing “we are loving the sinner, but
hating the sin”? How many times
do Christians reduce the problems
of society to “the liberal agenda”
or “the breakdown of family val-
ues”?

It is unfortunate that we, as
Christians, do not realize that our
religion is responsible for most of
the problems of society. We have
systematically exterminated mil-
lions of Jews. We have justified
enslaving the African continent.

.We have driven homosexuals and

other groups out of our churches.
The list of atrocities is endless.
Only through realizing our culpa-
bility can we move forward and try
to change the Christian church into
a true “place of love and accep-
tance.”’.’.". . ‘
