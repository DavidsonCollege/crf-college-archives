Clemson Cubs Walk Away
With Wildkitten Eleven |

Little Clemson Tigers Show Extra
Strength in Final Period and
Overcome Wildkitten Lead

The Davidson Wildkittens ended their |
season last Saturday when the little Clem-
son College Tigers returned to the fray in
the second half with renewed strength, and
swept the little Davidson team down the
field several times to make a final count of
25 to 7, in favor of the Clemson fresh. The
Wildkittens had led in the first half, 7 to 6,
but all the fight that they put forth in those
last two periods could not stay the drive of
the heavy Clemson’ team.

But the score should not have been so
great. The first touchdown Clemson
came when Davidson fumbled on her own
five-yard line, Clemson recovering and scor-
ing on the second play run. Another of
their when a punt
hit Kell, Clemson recovering on Davidson's
four-yard line, the Wildkittens fighting to
hold them, but being scored on on the third
down,

The freshmen
was the bigger, and
their smashing plays over the line shoved

the scrapping Wildkittens aside, and they

marched down the field for a total of 18
first downs, compared with six for the
Wildkittens,

Clemson won the game, it is true. but

the most sensational and thrilling play of
the contest was when Kell received a pass
from Wenhérg on Clemson's 30-yard line
and stepped off the remaining yardage he-
tween the goal post in’a beautiful dash for
a touchdown, The pass was for 17 yards,
the ball being put on play on Clemson's
47-yard line,

After Clemson had received the first break
of the game and had scored her first touch-
down in the initial period, the Wildkittens
showed their mettle by holding the Clemson
fresh for downs in their sacred zone, the
ball ‘going over to Davidson on her own
five-yard line. At this stage the Davidson
team an air attack that dazzled
Clemson and carried the ball to Clemson's

downs. A pass, Wenberg to McConnell,
was completed for 22 yards( soon followed

The las t game of the season is being |
played this afternoon, and when it is over the !
curtain will have fallen before one of the
best football season in the history of David-'
son College.

It has been a great season so far this

year, and the Wildcats have fought valiantly

in every game they have participated in.
The college is becoming known by the kind
of teams it puts into the field.

And just in that connection we are not
thinking so much of the winning team that
Davidson has had, but the type of students ,
who have been members of the squad—fine,
clean-cut} fellows, every one of them, high
in the estimation of the Davidson students,
and recognized by outsiders of men of true
worth,

We are a firm believer in the fact that
a good team will draw students to an insti-
tution. We do not mean athletes; we mean
good studénts.

Coach Monk Will Join Squad at End
of Football Season —

On Tuesday afternoon, November 17,
varsity basket-ball practice was called for the
first time. Fifteen men were chosen by
Coach Monk to take part in this early
practice. All of these men have had ex-
perience in former years or were stars on
their class teams this fall. Only one letter
man was present at the first practice, Tom
Anderson, the lanky center and high point
man for the past season.

But there are two other basket-ball letter
men in school, Hewlette and Laird, both of
whom are with the football squad and will
not be on the floor for a couple of weeks yet.

Staley, Boggs, Beall and McConnell were
four letter men who graduated from David-
son last spring and so Coach Monk Younger |

team.

In speaking of the type of students that
represent Davidson on the athletic field there |
occurred to us that profanity is not preva-
lent on the gridiron, in the practices or in
the games. If it is used, it is repressed so
that the public does not hear it. But we!
have witnessed games this year and have
heard oaths uttered after every play.

But the Davidson boys as a whole have
had more respect for themselves, for the
school they represent and for their opponents:
than to make a continuous habit of using
such terms in the games. We are proud of
the team, and proud of the men that com-

sense of the word.
