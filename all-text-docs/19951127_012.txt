So, like, you want to make a statement? You
want to show a little leg? You want to be a fashion
model, and have style? Like, you totally should’ ve
been at the FLAG fashion show! It was just, like,
so very. There were all these awesome models and
they were just so phat. It was, like, better thanCats!

No really, it was better than Cats! In all
seriousness, the FLAG fashion show was quite a
performance. Faculty, students, and alumni all
participated to make the show a dynamic success.
Hal Doughty and Cat Grimmel (both of ’94) re-
turned to emcee the show they began last year and
provided arunning commentary on the models and
their wear.. Their good humor and enthusiasm
made the show as funny as it was fascinating —and
believe me it was a lot of both.

Both creative and daring, the models strutted
their stuff around the circular stage. The platform,

designed by Miles Mowry, was an appropriate
combination of the female and male symbols with
the stems (arrow for male and cross for female)
serving as runways. This gave the participants a
chance to get up close and personal with the audi-
ence and let the crowd get a better look at the
outrageous performers.

The show was organized by different themes
— from formal wear to evening wear to funwear to
underwear — and for each set of models a song,
generally with a strong beat, played to give pizzazz
to their performance. Each costume reflected the
personality of the wearer — scary when you con-
sider the amount of vinyl and leather. Hal set the
mood for most of the show, appearing in black
tights, dog collar, and chain. 5

Buthis was only the start of it. Other provoca-
tive costumes were those of Jen Williams and Jesse
Ferraro, both sporting tight vinyl pants — that’s all
