During the past week the annual spring

who will compose our team this spring. Five

last year, a number of aspirants have come
out to contest for these vacant places, and
some spirited matches are being played.

The candidates for the team were divided

tournament is being run off in two sections,
one section composed of last year’s reserves
and the other of any who want to contend.
Preliminary tryouts place six of those of
past experiehce on the varsity round robin.
Those who were eliminated from the varsity
robin were placed on the reserves round
robin.
tournament will also enter the reserves robin
and then the reserves will be limited to six
jmen by elimination matches,

played off, a rating card will be drawn up,
in which by progressive challenging the re-

spective merits of the players in squads will

be determined, and the final membership of
‘the team will be decided. A varsity round
robin will be played by the six men compos-

ing the varsity squad to determine the stand- |

ing of the different members of the team.

At the present writing those in the varsity
robin are: I. M. McCutchen, captain; Dick
| Carr, Wood Brown, W. A. Alexander, J. A.
| McAlpine, and either H. M. Austin or R. A.
| Miller.

Those placed in the reserve robin are: J.
1G. Wharton, W. A. Christian and D. H.
Stuart.

Those remaining in the open elimination
tournament ate: J. S. Foster, F. D. Daniel,
\J. A. Vaughn, F. E. Hudgins, and S. W.
{ Moore.

| Goodykoontz stepped off the four-forty in
een flat in practice last week. If he
|

keeps this up the rest of the season, he will”

j be good for a number of points in several
imeets. His usual quota is fifteen points,
l which he managed to garner in nearly every
| meet last year. With Brand and Smith also
| showing up well in the dashes, Davidson
| should get quite a few points in the dashes
| this year.

| “What wuz the last card I dealt you,
| Droopy?” a

| “It was a spade.”

| “I knew it; I saw you spit on your
| hands before you picked it up.”

The’ second annual invitation track meet
has been finished and once more Charlotte |
High has walked away with the cup. The
Queen City runners succeeded in besting the |
Davidson yearlings this time, which they
were unable to do last year. Charlotte High
always has a good track team, to come up on
a par with her representatives in other sports.

The next of the high schools in the com-
petition for the cup was Greensboro. They
also had a good team, but nothing to cope
with those of Charlotte and the Wildkittens.
Their middle-distance men showed up better
than any of the others on the team.

Carolina-Davidson Game to be Part
of Junior Speaking Program

As one of the features of the Junior Speak-
ing program Davidson will play the Univer-
sity of North Carolina in baseball at Salis-
bury Monday afternoon at 3:00 o'clock.

This game has been an annual affair for
the last several years, until last spring being
staged at Gastonia, when the contest was
switched to the other North Carolina city.
The Tarheels ran off with the game last
Easter; their on-slaughter of hits combined
with a large number of errors made by the

; Wildcats made it impossible for the David-

This invitation meet, now an annual event,
should draw a number of athletes and other
! good men to Davidson in the coming years. |
‘When the high schools and their students
realize that Davidson is actively interested
in them, they will-become more interested in
| Davidson and send more of their good men

here. |
|

And speaking of track meets, that game
with Oak Ridge last Friday caused many to
think that the invitation meet had been
slipped up a day and that the Cadets had sent
a good nine man team to represent them. |
The score sounded more like a basketball |
score than baseball. But the satisfying part
is that Davidson won and avenged one of
{the two defeats that Oak Ridge handed us|
last year.

|

Coach Monk is pessimistic over the out- |
;come of the rest of the season, but with the
| wealth of material out for positions on the |
| team, there is a strong possibility of a credit- |
j able team before the season is ended.

|
|

| The golf team also made quite an aus- |

| picious beginning when they defeated Con- |
|cord in the first matches of the season. But
| they also should improve as the season rolls |
on, Several matches have been arranged |
with other Country clubs and the members of |
this team will have plenty of chances to prove |
“their worth. |

| The election of Carroll to the position, of
! basketball manager for next year was a fit- |
ting climax to three years of hard work on
the part of this man. For his first three
| years he was an assistant football manager,
| but after the last season he was shifted to!
[Baeetaall and proved his ability to manage
in that sport also, and was awarded the po-
sition of manager for his work. George
Batte should make a good fresh manager’
next year. With this pair working together,
we should have quite a few good games on
the court next year. ~

This week will be rather full of athletic
contests. The game with Dartmouth over,
the baseball team is ready to meet Lenoir
here tomorrow afternoon, while the tennis
team will play its first spring matches here
Saturday morning. The fresh nine will
open its season Saturday afternoon. And
then .Monday the varsity will have its big
game with Carolina in Salisbury. ee |

The fresh tennis team is: getting under |
way, with Manager Mac Austin, of the var-
sity, planning an elimination tournament and
several mects for them. With John T. Rod-
dey playing number one, which he is sure to
do, and also playing on the first team in the
| doubles, the freshmen ought to make a very
| good showing in their coming matches.

The class baseball series will start soon
and it is time for the various groups to begin
| thinking of the men eligible to play and get-
ting their team organized. This series will
| give a number of men a chance to play who
| have not yet heen quite able to make the
varsity.. Last year much interest was mani-
fested over the games and some real class

|was shown in some of them. |

son players to overcome an early earned
lead.

Preceded by the Lenoir-Rhyne game this
Friday, the locals will be in the top of form,
and with one victory balancing the defeat

suffered at the hands of the Quantico Marines

in the first contest of the season, the game

should be hotly contested.

In the Oak Ridge game last week the
Wildcats showed their hitting ability, when
four home runs were garnered, Captain Al-
ford making two, Woodham and Laird com-
ing in for theirs at this time. In the Marine
game Alford and Laird hit for four-ply
swats. Probably the same men as used last
week will start the game for Davidson, with
‘the pitchers and one infielder’s position uncer-
tain. Woodham, Kugler, Kimbrough, Dulin,
and Glenn, in the inner gardens, and Alford,
Johnson, Davis, in the outfield, will all see
duty. Vace will, in all probability, be at the
receiving of the batteries, with Laird, Oden,
Hampton, or Hue, at the other.
