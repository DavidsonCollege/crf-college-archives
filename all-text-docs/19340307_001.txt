College Orchestra
Merits State-Wide
Praise For Ability

Band to Give Concert Thursday
Night in Chambers Audi-

torium
PFOHL SUCCESSFUL

Collection Will Be Taken to Se-
cure Uniforms.

A concert at 8 o’clock on Thursday
night by the Davidson College Band
will open its drive to secure uniforms.
No admission will be charged, but a
collection after the concert will give
Davidson followers a chance to con-
tribute.

Starting in September, the college
band played at all home games and
at two off-campus games. Other ac-
tivities of the band were their concerts
over Station WBT»in Charlotte and a
concert at Barium Springs. Letters
were received from all over the South
commenting on the band’s activities.

Several North and South Carolina
newspapers have carried articles on the
band’s performances at the games, and
J. C. Harper, director of the famous
Lenoir Band, stated that “the David-
son band has come from one of the
worst’ college bands in the state to one
of the best in the South.”

But along with the praises received
by the band were inquiries concern-
ing “the soldier suits,” “the poorly
dressed band,” and similar phrases.

The ‘band has practiced three times
a week regularly throughout the past
five months and is now working over-
time’ to polish up the performance.
The program for the night is termed
by Pfohl as “one which any college
band would be proud to render.” It
includes the difficult Overture to
Stradella, by Flotow, “The Atlantis
Suite,” by Safranek, and “ Romance,”

Students’ Aid Asked

In Securing New Men

Prospects for Next Year Are Un-
usually Good

During the latter part of last week,
blanks were distributed throughout the
dormitories for the purpose of ascer-
taining the names of prospective stu-
dents. This plan was followed last
year and the results obtained were
very satisfactory, according to a re-
port from the registrar’s office. More
students are obtained through this
method of advertisement than any
other way. Special notice should be
taken by the students in filling out and
returning these cards.

January bulletins “Ot -Choosing
Your College” were sent to approxi-
mately twenty thousand high schools
throughout the South from the college
advertisement headquarters of David-
son. Davidson bulletins were also sent
to all the leading preparatory schools.

Registrar F. W. Hengeveld stated
that “the number of students accepted
by the college for the coming year is
about the same as were accepted at
this time last year.
next year are unusually good.”

Davidson advertisements are being
carried in several leading church pe-
riodicals and magazines throughout the
South. Dr. Walter L. Lingle has active
charge of all the advertising.

Mr. Hengeveld will make an exten-
sive tour of the high schools in this
state the latter part of this month for
the purpose of talking with prospective
students,

Emory Glee Club Sings
In Charlotte Tuesday

The Emory Glee Club of Atlanta,
Ga., sang in the auditorium of Queens-
Chicora College in Charlotte on Tues-
day night, February 27. The glee club
sang several classical numbers and
numerous negro spirituals. The selec-
tions, especially the spirituals, were
greatly appreciated by the large audi-
ence,

In the opinion of Mr. James C.
Pfohl, director of music at Davidson
College, this glee club is one of the
finest in the country. Mr. Pfohl was
impressed by the fact that this glee
club rehearses five times a week be-
fore singing their weekly program in
one of the churches in Atlanta.

Masquers To Give
“Candida” Tuesday

Bernard Shaw’s Famous Play Is
Club’s First

Tuesday, March 13, has been de-
cided upon to be the date of the Red
and Black Masquers’ presentation of
George Bernard Shaw's“ Candida.” On
that date, one performance will be
given at 8 o'clock in the evening.

Rehearsals have been held for the
past three weeks under the direction
of G. R. Wood and under the supervi-
sion of Prof, E. J. Erwin. , This week’s
rehearsals will be upon the play as
a whole, instead of single acts, as for-
merly. The dress rehearsals will be
held Monday night.

The cast is led by Mrs. W. P. Cum-
ming as Candida; D. W. Hollings-
worth acts as Morell, her husband;
W. F. Goodykoontz, Marchbanks, the
“weakling,” who thinks himself in love
with her; N. H. Wauda, Burgess, Can-
dida’s comic, cockney father; Miss
Orrie Steele, Proserpine Garnett, and
J. H. Simpson, Mr. Mill, the curate.
None of the cast is without considef-
able experience in acting, either with
the Masquers or with other companies.

A. S. Rachal, stage manager, states
that all of the stage properties have
been completed, and that the old ones
have been rebuilt, and that several
additions to the Masquers’ sets have
been made in the past few weeks.
Rachal is assisted in that work by
Reid’ Grantham, D. F, Herring and
W. M. Taylor.

“Candida” is one of Shaw’s best-
known plays today, although when it
was written in 1894, the author was
unable to find a publisher for it until
several years later.”’ First produced in
Germany, “Candida” created a stir
wherever it was given in the “Gay
'90's.” Since its first appearance, the
play has had long runs in New York,
Boston, Cleveland, London, Edinburgh,
Berlin, and Quebec.

In Western States

Stutts and Smith Left Saturday
on Trip to Tennessee and
Kentucky

The Davidson debating team left
Saturday on its Western trip. Albert
C. Stutts and Robert H. Smith uphold
the affirmative side throughout the
tour on the subject, “Resolved: That
the powers of the president of the
United States of America should be
substantially. increased as a settled pol-
icy.” They debated March 5 with the
University of the South, Sewanee,
Tenn., and then with the University
of Kentucky, Lexington, on March 7.

Davidson was represented by Gor-
don H. Brown and Rawling Pratt-
Thomas on its Southern tour, They
debated over the radio with the Uni-
versity of Georgia. Then at Coral
Gables, Florida, they debated the Uni-
versity of Miami on an open-air plat-
form, There was no decision on this
tour, but on February 27 they won
an audience decision against the Uni-
versity of Charleston, at Charleston,
South Carolina.

Another trip will be taken by J. H.
Fitzgerald and E. J. Humphrey through
Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and
New Jersey.

the Southern trip, the coaches of each
team that was debated conceded that
the Davidson men had the best argu-
ments. Many Davidson men—heard
the debates broadcast from Miami and
the University of Georgia.

Freshmen Talk of

Future On Campus

Powell, Jeckson ‘and Williams
Are Speakers at Smoker

The freshmen met in their first get-
together at a smoker Friday night
when they discussed plans whereby
the class of 37 could make a name
ior itself at Davidson. The meeting
was called by the freshman adviser,
E. L, Powell, and speakers for the
occasion were F. L. Jackson and Dean
J. P. Williams.

The abolition of theft was empha-
sized by Jackson as a goal toward
which the class could work. He re-
lated numerous incidents of theft that
he had seen during his administration
and pointed out that the criminal was
nearly always detected and that there
was no second chance for a thief at
Davidson.

He told several stories where re-
morse of conscience had led students
to confession of crime many years
after graduation. “If the class of '37
could individually bear down on per-
sonal honesty,” stated Jackson, “and
collectively fight theft, it would add
much to Davidson.”

Dean Williams presented two plans
for consideration by the freshmen. The
first was a “privilege plan” which in-
volved the consideration of absence
cuts, student government and the
question of freshmen wearing caps and
carrying laundry, The second plan, a
“progress plan,” was one by which
the class could take steps toward build-
ing a social center, for activities, or
for a swimming pool.

Powell first presented two definite
ideas that the freshmen could com-
bine in their plans and then listed four

Founders Day To

Special, Program Planned for the
Observance of 97th Anni-
versary

A special program has been planned
for Thursday, April 12, as an observ-
ance of Founders’ Day at Davidson.
This day was set aside by the Board
of Trustees at their recent’ meeting.

Davidson's 97th anniversary, and will

nial celebration in 1937. These Found-

President Resigns
Lenoir-Rhyne Post

Action Follows Controversy Over
Athletics

Dr. H. B. Schaeffer, president of
Lenoir-Rhyne College since 1926, has
definitely tendered his resignation: to
the+ Board of ‘Trustees’ of Lenoir-
Rhyne, it was learned here Wednesday,
February 28,

This action came after the trustees
refused to abolish the athletic pro-
gram as at present constituted. Dr.
Schaeffer, it was explained, did nét
wish to do away with athletics entirely,
but under his plan, the present sys-
tem of intercollegiate football now in
vogue at the college would have been
eliminated,

The resignation has been accepted
by J. A. Moretz of Hickory, chairman
of the college board. Mr. Moretz, in
a statement, said that the request of
Dr. Schaeffer to be released cannot, of
course, be formally acted upon by the
trustees until their regular meeting,
which will be held in May.

He expressed the view, however,
that the wishes of Dr. Schaeffer should
be respected, and since he feels that
it is not feasible for him to continue
on as head of the institution, the board
will have no other alternative but to
comply.

Dr. Schaeffer had formally placed
his resignation on file with the board
at its meeting February 8, but the
trustees had rejected it at that time.
Dr. Schaeffer will remain in office un-
til July 1.

The demand of Dr. Schaeffer to have
his resignation accepted followed one
of the most important meetings of the
Board of Trustees of Lenoir-Rhyne
College in many years.

The meeting, which was set for the

The Twenty-third Annual Missions
Conference of the North Carolina Stu-
dent Volunteer Union was held in Win-
ston-Salem March 2-4, with Francis
Scott of Davidson, retiring president,
in charge.

The theme of the conference was
“Christ in the World Today.” Devel-
oping this central topic in a_ series
of addresses were Dr. C. Darby Ful-
ton, Executive Secretary of the For-
eign Missions Board of the Presbyte-
rian Church; Dr. P. H. Gwynn, of the
Davidson College Sociology Depart-
ment; the Rey. A. B. Dipeolu, native-
born West African, now working to-

and Mr. J. W. Clay, former mission-
ary to Brazil. The conference closed
with a banquet Saturday evening and
a final address by Dr. Fulton at the
regular service Sunday morning at the
Brown Memorial Church.

About a dozen colleges and univer-
sities over the state were represented
at the conference. Delegates were en-
tertained at the homes of interested
families in the city.

The retiring council selected the fol-
lowing members to serve for the com-
ing year: Dorothy Clay, Greensboro
College, president; Charles Foggie,
Livingston College, vice. - president;
Katie Sue Taylor, Greensboro College,
secretary; Evelyn Caudle, A. S. T. C,
treasurer; Robert Woodside, of David-
son College, out-of-college secretary;

William Bell, Frank Brown, Robert
Coit, Audley Gammon, John McMullen,
Rufus Morrow, Hervey Ross, Francis
Scott, Kenneth Scott, Robert Wood-
side, and Sam Wiley, “Y” secretary.
The Davidson group won the distinc-
tion of having sent out more deputa-
tions than any other to neighboring
churches and schools, largely as a re-
sult of the efforts of Robert Woodside,
deputation secretary for the local
group.

Juniors Plan Unique
Feature For Dances

Partial Masquerade to Be Held at
First Dance

According to the president of the
Junior class, K. D, Weeks, the first of
the Junior Speaking dances will be in
the form of a partial masquerade. Last
year this class in presenting its part
in the social functions of the college
exercised a touch of originality by
staging a cabaret affair in the school
gymnasium, and again we see the third
year men introducing something new
into Davidson dances, with the mas-
querade idea.

Eye masks will be given the dancers
as they enter the hall, and they are
to be worn until intermission, when
everyone shall remove his disguise.
There will be a host of balloons
dropped from the ceiling during the
rest period, which should add to the
color of the occasion.

This set of dances will be held in
the Charlotte Armory-Auditorium Fri-
day and Saturday, March 23 and 24,
with Johnny Long and his Duke Col-

legians furnishing the music.

Dr.T. H. Sparrow
Gives Lecture To
Pre-Med Students

Prominent Charlotte Physician
Talks to Students on Med-
ical Field

TALK GIVEN FRIDAY

Answers Questions Handed in by
Attending Students

The first of a series of vocational
guidance lectures was delivered in Phi
Hall last Friday night by Dr. Thomas
H. Sparrow, of Charlotte. Dr. Spar-
row, a well-known physician and a
graduate of Davidson College, chose as
his subject for the lecture “The Voca-
tion of Medicine.” A large crowd of
prospective medical students and
others interested in that particular field
attended,

These lectures, which are being spon-
sored by the “Y,”’ have been very
beneficial in the past to men undecid-
cd in their life work, and are a great
help to those who wish to become more
familiar with their prospective occu-
pations,

In Friday night’s address, Dr. Spar-
row chose questions which are most
likely to confront the medical student
in his preparation for a career in med-
icine. As an introduction to these
questions, he pointed that the study
of medicine is arduous, but it is won-
derful in its accomplishment and its
varied interest. “If you can but for-
get its rewards,” he said, “in the worry
over whether you are doing what is
expected of you and what is best, and
strive to do it, rewards will-come until
you wonder whether you deserve them,

Local French Circle
*~Has Recent Meeting

Make Plans for Joint Program
With Salem

Members of Le Cercle Francais, Da-

vidson honorary French fraternity,
Were entertained at their regular
monthly meeting last Wednesday

night, by a program which took place
at the Phi Gamma Delta house.

The meeting was opened by the pres-
ident, Lanier Pratt, who directed the
business session at the first period of
the program,. At this time the report
of the committee on the drawing up
of the new constitution was heard. The
society also voted to fill their usual
two pages in the Annual.

A discussion was formulated-during
the session of the joint meeting to be
held with the Salem College “Alliance
Francais” at a date later in March. At
that time the local organization will
present the two new plays which it
has been preparing for the occasion.

At the end of the business period
a varied entertainment was offered, in-
cluding the reading of two papers, on
Montaigne, whose birthday was cele-
brated Wednesday, and Lamartine,
whose death anniversary was com-
memorated on the same day.

Another feature of the program was
the presentation of one of the plays
now being practiced by the club. After
playing several French games, the
Cercle was served delicious refresh-
ments prepared by Mrs. Watts and
Mrs. Goldiere, and the grqup adjourned.

At the next meeting of the club, it
is probable that a French lecture will
be given by a visiting French native.
This meeting will be open to all stu-
dents interested in French.

Gamma Sigma Epsilon

Gamma Sigma Epsilon, national
chemistry fraternity, held a meeting

searches being made in the field of
atomic physics. Sam Nickey also ad-
dressed the meeting on a subject rt--
lated to chemistry.
