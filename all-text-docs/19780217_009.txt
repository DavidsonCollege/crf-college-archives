STEP tutors discuss diverse and overwhelming
benefits ; find few drawbacks with STEP program

“We can’t really see fully into the
child's mind and know just how much
he appreciates and looks forward to
this,’’ explained Eugene Heath con-

cerning the STEP tutor program.

The STEP program was initiated six
years ago by the Davidson YMCA to
provide children in grades 2-6 from
Davidson Elementary with a ‘‘big bro-
ther/big sister’’ as well as to help them
with problems in schoolwork. Yet, as
Meg Campbell, who leads the STEP
block" states, ‘‘'The strongest em-
phasis was placed on the relationship
aspect.”

Campbell continued, ‘his year, we
are continuing to stress the benefits of

LYNN forming a strong relationship with the
a their child, but with an increased emphasis
s been upon some sort of academic tutoring.”’
Kelly. Lynn Grice outlined her goals as a
if. By STEP tutor. ‘I’m helping her find the
‘ement motivation within herself. By listening

to her read, I can give her positive
trader}

reinforcement without being a, teacher
figure.”

‘! “The program is pretty much what

you make of it,’’ added John Davis.
‘There is not much structural guidance
which gives you the chance to tutor in a
non-pressured atmosphere.”

The tutors are expected to meet with
their child one afternoon a week with
the first half an hour usually devoted to
academics.

Jamie Watt, who also leads this
‘“block’’ pointed out another reason for
the new shift of emphasis. ‘‘We're
trying to keep it from being too
superficial. To have a STEP tutor is a
status symbol for kids. I think the kids
are more willing to study when they
know that they have to with a tutor.”

Many tutors discover added dimen-
sions to the STEP tutor program other
than just academic needs of the
children. ‘‘With my child, I find that
emotionally, I am sort of a big sister to
her,’’ explained Grice. ‘‘Both her
parents work and as a result, they

don't always have free afternoons to

play with her.”’

“We have built a very strong
trusting relationship and through that
she’s taking initiative on her own;
being creative in her own way.”

In outlining several problems with
STEP, Campbell pointed out that ‘‘The
biggest problem is continuity. There
are 86 tutors participating in the
program. In the past we have had
trouble keeping up with all the tutors
to make sure that things are running

- smoothly.”

Grice elaborated, ‘I get frustrated
when I see those who don't follow
through. The tutors are the most
important thing to them. To win their
confidence and then to step out because
of academics is to me a total cop-out.”

Heath added, ‘‘When people don't
continue, thé kid doesn’t know what to
think. He just can't understand.”’

“Another drawback,"’ said Camp-
bell, ‘is that through the STEP tutor
program, the children begin to enjoy
coming on campus. But when they
reach seventh grade they're not. al-

lowed. It’s not really fair to the child.
I'd like to look into a similar program
for the junior highs.’’

Currently, Watt is working on new
plans and programs for the near future
such as STEP library with books and
games; encouraging tutors to take their
children to the new school house of the
arts; a nurse to speak to the tutors
about establishing relationships with
children; and small group trips during
the spring that will enable the frater-
nities and eating houses to get in-
volved.

For most STEP tutors, however, the
benefits prove to be overwhelming. “At
Davidson, it’s very easy to get
wrapped up in your studies. The Y's
strong point is indeed its outward
focus,’ said Campbell.

Allen Laws agreed, ‘Tutoring pro-
vides you with a different perspective
on Davidson and also.enables you to
see life from a kid's point of view.”

‘For one day a week I can be
eight-years-old,"’ concluded Grice. ‘It
is the most warming experience for me
here. It helps me keep my sanity."’

Darbyshire hopes that the Y
will be used to ‘‘funnel student
interest in service projects.’’ As
part of an effort to have a more
efficient and effective Y, there
have been some organizational
changes.

New Organization

Y programs are now divided
into 10 blocks each headed by a
leader or block-head. According
to Darbyshire, this will allow
for a smoother operation and a
better delegation of responsibi-
lities. He went on to add that
this would make it easier for the
block-heads ‘‘to get to interest-
ed people and to keep up with
those people.’’ Furthermore,
under this system, students
could work on areas of specific
interest and not become too
overloaded.

Blocks/ Projects

The most prominent of the
Y’s ten blocks include according
to a YM/YWG€EA report: 1) the
STEP - Standardized Tutorial
Educational Program in which
over 80 Davidson students pro-
vide academic and social help to
elementary school students, 2)
the CROP program which spon-
sers weekly lunches, the pro-
ceeds from which go to alleviate
world hunger, 3) the North
Mecklenberg YMCA program
which reoruits students to di-
rect and staff programs at the
North Mecklenburg Y in Corne-
lius, 4) the prison visitation
program at HuntersVille, 0) tne

dents, faculty, administration,
and townspeople, and 6) the
Environmental block that is
currently involved in a glass
recycling project and in a letter
writing campaign opposed to
the building of the Trotter
Shoals Dam.

Besides these blocks, Darby-
shire stresses that the Y can
provide funding for any student
who has an idea for a service
project. Vice President of the
YM/YWCA Bonnie Wright
added that, “If a student has a
specific project we can also help

Prospective Activities

Projects that the Y has
investigated but not yet institu-
ted include tutoring for junior
high school students, discus-
sion groups an Adopt-a-Senior
program, and activities at the
Davidson Public Library in-
cluding a film afternoon and
puppet shows for children.

These projects and many
others have been researched and
have Y members willing to org-
anize them if student interest is
great enough.

Projects that the Y is cur-
rently investigating include fac-
ulty open houses, preparing a
slide show to present at fresh-
man orientation to acquaint
students with the community.
and its needs, and the possibil-
ity of registering students to
vote in Davidson.

Name Change

The Y is also considering
undergoing a name change. The
organization is no longer offi-
cially affiliated with the YMCA
and Darbyshire feels that stu-
dents apply misleading conno-
tations because of the name.
However, it does have ‘‘student
recognition’’ therefore a pos-
sible name change will probably
wait until next year.

According to Wright, ‘‘The Y
has an extreme amount of
potential. At our meetings peo-
ple get very excited about what
we could do.”’ But Darbyshire
adds, “‘the programs aren’t of
ultimo‘ ‘\pamkance unless pec
ple want to be involved -- their
willingness to serve is‘the most
important thing.” es hEA haces bo ieee
