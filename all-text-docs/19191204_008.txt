Real Men Only Wanted for
“y” Secretaries

Training of Young Men’s Christian
Association Workers for
the New Day”

There was once a time when any
man who aspired to be a secretary
of the Young Men’s Christian Asso-
ciation asked himself whether he
was a hale-fellow-well-met, wheth-
er he could jolly the boys, and per-
haps whether he had some organiz-
ing ability.

Such conceptions of the associa-

tion worker belong to the past and|.

those who study the Young Men's
Christian ‘Association movement of
today know it takes a real man

with real training to measure up to!

the responsibilities of this work.
The Young Men's Christian Asso-
ciation is not a simple prayer meet-
ing—though it believes in prayer as:
it never did before. It is not a so-,
cial club—though it realizes that the

_social instincts of men are strong
and: that no man can be his best

who does not develop these in-

stincts under wholesome social

conditions. It is not a gyninasium

which builds bodies tor men—

though it realizes fully the moral

and religious significance of strong

and healthy bodies. It is not a dor-

mitary building—though it believes

that many thousands of young men

have been saved to society and the

church by the fact that the associa-

tion building gave the young man a

clean, safe place to stay in his for-

mative period, while getting himself

established in the city.

The Young Men’s Christian As-
sociation is no one of these. It is
rather all of these with much be-
sides. It is a statesmanlike move-
ment, of men, for the sake of men,
to make’ conditions in the city and
country alike such a place of whole-
someness, of social justice and re-
ligious interest as will help to usher
‘in the Kingdom of God among men.

To be a secretary in such a move-|
ment calls for real manhood—with |
wholesome physical life, trained in-
tellect and a soul afire with love for
men. Let us suggest five qualities '
in any really successful secretary
and say a word about how training
should help to develop such quali-
ties ina man. One does not name
them in their order of importance,
but perhaps in the reverse order.

1, The first qualification which|
one would mention is the technique
of skillful organization. This can-
-not be omitted and success still
crown the effort of the worker. Our
organization is one of work-a-day
_ men. Its home is usually located in
the heart of the business and most
active part of a city’s business. The
architecture is that of a great office
building. It dezis with men hot
from the contests of highly organ-
ized business. As a business or-|
ganization the average city asso-
ciation is no mean concern. Many
a city association in a city the size
of Nashville or larger, does a busi-
ness of from $100,000 per vear wu
to five, six, seven hundred thousand,
or even a fillion dollars per year.
The New York and Chicago associa-
tions are both million dollar con-
cerns in the volume of business han-

ed,

2. In the second place the secre-
tary of today must have a social
sense and technical training in so-
ciology. The most marked advance
in the business world has been a
larger sense of social responsibility.
The average Rotary club of today
has more sense-of obligation to the
mass of men who need help than
the average church had 50 years
ago. A recent number of the Ki-

of Brooklyn; Shuritiff, of Cleveland,
and numerous other secretaries who
have had the training and capacity
for such work.

4, Lastly, the secretary of the
association must have training in
that type of practical psychology
which helps him interpret the soul
hunger of men. He must know
men. He must know their meth-
ods of thinking, and above all he
must have a passion to help them,

In order to get men of this type
of training there has been a long
felt need for a training college oi
the Young Men’s Christian Associa-
tion in the South. This college
should give thorough professional
training for secretaries as a theo-
logical seminary gives professional
training for ministers. Only one
should say parenthetically that it
should be much more related to life
than the training in some seminaries
we have known.

The new Southern College of
Young Men’s Christian Associa-
tion will run 12 months in the year.
divided into four terms. The three
winter quarters will be held in
Nashville, Tenn., in connection with
George Peabody College for Teach-
ers, Seaman A. Knapp School of
Country Life, Vanderbilt Univer-
sity, Vanderbilt School of Religion
and Vanderbilt ‘Medical College.
The college will have the very clos-
est co-operation of these institu-
tions, although it is an entirely au-
tonomous institution, acting under
its own charter and with its own
board of directors. The summer
quarter of the college will be held
during the months of June, July
and August, at the Blue Ridge
grounds, Blue Ridge, N. C. | In like
manner there is the very closest
co-operation with the Blue Ridge
Association, a number of the board
members of the Blue Ridge Asso-
of directors of the college being also
ciation Committee. The very com-
plete equipment, the high altitude,
and wonderful scenery surrounding
Blue Ridge make this an ideal place
for summer work.

The college is being projected in
harmony with the highest stand-
ards of university life and will from
the very start be a school for pro-
fessional training and not an un-
der-graduate school. Students will
be admitted to its courses with the
possibility of graduation who have
had at least two years of college
training, but a very definite bid is
being made for college graduates.
The course will extend over eight

or full two years of medical work
will be taken in connection with
the Vanderbilt Medical College,; |
special attention being given to, |
topics like anatomy,’ physiology,’

cal director will be required to carry
a certain amount of association
studies, such as association history
and methods, courses on fundamen-
tals of Christian life, courses on the
Old and New Testaments, etc.

The college opened its doors on
October 1 and it is expected that
during the first year we will matri-
culate not less than 50 students.
