ords.

The Winter Consort gets its
name from the Renaissance
Consort. one of the earliest

instrumental groups that at-
tempted to achieve a homo-
geneous blend among their
instruments. Only the Wood-
winds, strings and percus-
sion instruments were used.

The Winter Concort is based
on the this same ideal. They
also use such exotic instru-
ments as the African thump-
piano, the Israeli jar-drum.
the Renaissance racket (an
ancient double-reed instru-

ment) and others. ;

The group will soon release
an album produced in con-
junction with Paul Stookey

formance there will be a

Satanie Art Places In

By GEORGE ALLEN
News Editor

Bill Moye’s paintings are-
“frightening, nervous and
satanic, and demonic in ‘their
preception,”’ according to one
of Moye’s friends.

Moye. a sophomore from
Hickory. entered. one of his
paintings in the Charlotte Art
League's Tri-State Open
Painting and Sculpture Show
last week and won a prize of
$50 for third place in the
painting division.

The painting which won, a

pictured a black woman hang-

stretched across her back-
yard.

‘Although Moye painted
“Wash” when he was 16, he
titled it just before entering
it in the art show.

“T wanted to keep the title
simple.” said Moye. “I

painting.”

Although his paintings have
been dsecribed as ‘‘satanic
and demonic.” Moye is a
gentle, sensitive. shy person.

* ‘Wash’ is completely con-
trived, painted with no real
message intended."’ he said.
“What may be frightening
about the painting is that. for
no particular reason, I ignor-
ed some details which might
usually be heightened and
emphasized others which
might otherwise be overlook-
ed.

** T became fascinated by the

geometry of the wires with
the laundry on them,”’ Moye
said. “With the perspective
of the wires, the painting
moves in two different di-
rections. You have to look
both at the woman in the
foreground and at the con-
verging wires in the back-
ground. It is certainly nothing
pretty to look at, at all.”

Moye is essentially a self-
made artist. Except for a
six-week art course he took
as a child, he has had no
formal art training.

“Training isn’t worth too
much,"" Moye said. ‘‘Prac-
tice makes the painter. I'm

organize support for a boy-
cott of the sale of California
table grapes.

Seniors Marvin Sparrow
and Mike Norris are trying
to introduce the nation-wide
boycott in the Charlotte area
because the effort has fe-
ceived little publicity in the
South since. its start a year
ago.

The boycott arose out of a
strike begun by California .
grape pickers 43. months ago.
Cesar Chavez, former grape-
picker and organizer of the
strike, felt. that a boycott
was necessary to get the
grape growers to recognize
the farm workers union.

The growers circumvented
the strike by hiring strike-
breakers to pick their
grapes, Sparrow said.

Although sales in Califor.
nia have dropped 20 percent
since the boycott began,
Sparrow is the first active
organizer for support of the
boycott in the Charlotte area..
A campus meeting Sept. 26
attracted about 10 to 12 oth-
er students interested in the
effort.

Sparrow, Norris and other
students visited stores in
southeast Charlotte including
the Costwold and Charlotte-

town Mall shopping centers .

last weekend to start organ-
izing the boycott.

Church
Rule On
Agenda

A resolution that would les-
sen the so-called Presbyteri-
an restriction on the David-
son presidency will be con-
sidered by the Board of
Trustees at its annual fall
meeting here next weekend.

Up for a vote will be a res-
olution docketed last May
that would alter the trustee
bylaw requiring that the col-
lege's president be a mem-
ber of the Presbyterian
Church when elected and a
member of the Presbyterian
Church in the United States
(Southern) when inaugurat-
ed.

The resolution, proposed
May 3 in response to criti-
cism of the controversial by-
law, still stresses, however.
that the president be a ‘‘ded-
icated Christian.”

“Since that man _ will be
so clearly recognized as a
Christian leader."' Trustee
President Walter L. Lingle
Jr. said in May, he should
become a member of the
Davidson College Presbyteri-
an Church before his inaugu-
ration “to clearly demon-
strate that he has that dedi-
cation to religious leader-
ship in the college.”

Also on the agenda for next
weekend are discussion of a
location for the new Edward
H. Little Library, an investi-
gation of the college’s en-
dowment investment policies
and a‘decision on the Code
of Responsibility.

New Cinema Exhilirating, Sad,
Shocking, Hilarious Experience

A REVIEW
By ANTHONY S. ABBOTT

New Cinema: Program One
is an exhilirating experience,
sometimes hilarious. some-
times sad, sometimes shock-
ing, but always alive and
thought.provoking.

What is New Cinema? It is
a collection of. nine short
films, three in color, that run
the gamut from slapstick
comedy to profound social
criticism. The films vary in
length from the two short
pieces of animation, ‘‘Enter
Hamlet’. and ‘Two Castles,”

both under five minutes, to.

the 27-minute finale of the
evening, “La  Jetee.”’ a
searching study of man's
mortal limitations.

Because I'm interested in

Scholarship Fund
Didn't Make Goal

According to Larry Slade,
one of the co-chairmen of
the Negro Scholarship Fund
Drive, nothing has been done
with the money collected
last year, and no definite
plans have yet been made
about how it should be used.

Slade said that the money,
over $2000, which was raised
from student contributions to
match a challenge from Dr.
W. G. Workman. has not
been turned over to the col.
lege.

money he won in the Char-
lotte art show, Moye didn't
think ‘that either the money
or the contest was very im-
portant.

“T have ambitions to paint,
but the money is really sec-
ondary because: once I have
it, I don’t know what to do
with it,"" he said.

“I would like to -live a
simple life on a farm if I
could and try to support my-
self on the money I could get
through painting.”

Moye's painting is now on
display through Wednesday
at the Charlottetown Mall.

gram is largely humorous,
with three of the first five
films — “Enter Hamlet,"
“The Standing Still! Film.”
and ‘Two Castles’ — utiliz-
ing a variety of successful
comic techniques.

The most ingenious and
imaginative film in this
part of the program is ‘‘Re-
naissance,"' in which a series
of objects in a room reas-
semble themselves after an
explosion.

The techinical achieve.
ment here is extra-ordinary,
and beneath the surface ab-
surdity there is a clear and
meaningful point to be made.

The second half of the pro-
gram demands closer invest-
igation. With the audience
well hooked by the effect.
ive humor of the first five
films, two of the last four
put the viewer through in-
tense emotional experiences
that leave him stunned at
the end.

“Corrida Interdite’’ is by
itself worth the price of ad-
mission as it portrays in
in shocking graphic terms
the various stages of the
bullfight from the opening
passes to the final killing of
the bull — or matador.

“La Jetee,”’ the final film
of the program, creates an
experience very nearly equal
to that of ‘‘Corrida Inter-
dite." On the surface a sci-
ence fiction adventure in
which a survivor of World
War DI visits both his past

and his future, it utilizes fine
dramatic performances to
on man’s. eternal struggle
to overcome isolation and
transcend death.

I have not yet commented
on three of the films - ‘‘Al-
lures," “The Fat and the
Lean”: and ‘‘Les Mistons.”’

The first is a color vision of.

outer space in which audio
and visual are beautifully
coordinated.

The second is an allegory
mueh of Samuel Beckett's
play “Endgame” in which
a thin servant waits upon a
fat master and dreams of
freedom. It makes most ef-
fective use of irony to make
its major point, a point that

each member of the audience.

will interpret in his own way.
Finally there is ‘‘Les Mis.

tons,’ to me the one disap.
pointment of the evening.
Directed by France's Fran-
cois Truffault, whose superb
feature length film, ‘Shoot
the Piano Player.”’ will be
shown later this year, ‘Les
Mistons’ does not demonst-
rate either what Truffault
is capable of nor what the
film medium is capable of. It
tells an interesting story
of adolescent envy and con-
fusion, but its visual tech-
niques are dull and unimag-
inative: it fails to translate
its story into cinematic
terms.

One failure out of nine is
not much to complain of.
All in all ‘New Cinema: Pro-
gram One‘is an exceptional
achievement. rising at least
twice to the level of great
art.
