Cats baseball just misses NCAA post-season play

By MATT NEWSOM

The 1987 Wildcat baseball
team tied the all-time record for
wins in a season last Thursday as
they beat UNCC in the first game
of a three-game series with the
49ers. However, win number
twenty-five eluded the Cats as
they dropped the next three
games, two heart-breakers to
UNCC and a tough loss to Geo-
rgia.

Last Thursday’s game pitted
Davidson versus cross-town rival
UNCC at Crockett Park, the home
of the Charlotte O’s minor league
team. Senior Steve Condon
pitched perhaps his best game of
the year scattering eight hits and
striking out twelve; many of the
49er batters never even saw his
fastball. Davidson’s bats were
alive as Wildcat batters collected

eleven runs on fitteen hits, of
which six were doubles and two
were homers. Catcher Dan
Simonds and first baseman Mark
Thompson each reached the Croc-
kett Park fences; Simonds hit a
solo blast in the fourth inning,
while Thompson launched a two-
run rocket in the fifth. Sophomore
second baseman Michael Holland
collected his first hit as a Wildcat,
a two-run double in the fourth
which ignited the Cats. The com-
bination of the Cats’ bats in action
and Condon’s wizardry on the
mound proved to be too much for
UNCC as Davidson won 11-4.

The DC-UNCC series con-
tinued on Friday afternoon as the
49ers invaded Davidson and took
a close 10-8 victory from the Cats.
Holland and Brian Moure each hit
solo homers for two Wildcat runs.

In. the sixth inning Holland and
Bill Masse hit back-to-back tri-
ples, Masse’s scoring Holland.
Alan Lewis grounded out but
picked up an RBI as Masse scored
on the play. Moure and Simonds
scored in a seventh-inning rally
for Davidson, and as Jeff Loser re-
lieved Dave Fitzgerald in the
eighth inning, the score was knot-
ted at eight. UNCC picked up two
quick runs to take a slim lead. At
this point the rains came, and the
game was called in the top of the
eighth with UNCC leading 10-8.

Once again, rain proved to be

Davidson’s greatest enemy on.

Sunday as the 49ers came away
with a 2-1 victory in a rain-shor-
tened game at UNCC. Greg Wil-
cox lost a heart-breaker .as he
yielded only two runs on four hits

and struck out nine in eight in-

nings of action. The Cats reached

UNCC pitching for eight hits but

could only muster one run. David-
son’s only run came in the fifth in-

ning when designated hitter Rob—

Zimmerman doubled and scored
on Dave Turgeon’s single.

Wednesday night thé” Cats
traveled to Bulldog country where
they played eighth-ranked Geo-
rgia. Lewis and Turgeon hit din-
gers, and the score was tied after
three innings. Then Georgia
brought in Derek Lillequist fol-
lowed by Cris Carpenter, two of
the top college pitching prospects
in the country, and they proceeded
to shut out Davidson the rest of the
way. Condon, Fitzgerald, and
Billy Waitsman combined on the
pitching effort for Davidson.

Davidson will close out their
season this weekend as they play

NC State this afternoon at UNCC
at 3 pm, host Southern Mississippi
on Saturday at 3 pm, and host pe-
rennial probation powerhouse
