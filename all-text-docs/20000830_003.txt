When the new crop of students arrives
éach year, new faculty are bound to follow.

Over the past two weeks, while the fresh-
men have been getting their bearings on cam-
pus, the campus ha’ also been teeming with
slightly more aged faces wandering around.
This year, there are twenty-eight new profes-
sors teaching, instructing, and learning the
ways of Davidson College.

Last semester, Davidson advertised in

countless academic journals hoping to fill .

positions in almost every department. There
were about fifteen visiting professor posi-
tions (temporary) to fill, and thirteen tenure-
track positions (permanent).

Dr. Clark Ross, Dean of Faculty, holds
special insight into this wide range of new
recruits. He personally interviewed all fifty-
five candidates for the tenured positions, many
more than usual.

For each tenured post, the college brings
in three or four applicants for an interview
and tour of the campus. This courtship was
quite successful, as Dean Ross describes it,
introducing an array of “superb new teacher-
scholars.” Here are the abridged life stories
of a few of them:

Dr. Christopher Paradise, assistant pro-
fessor of Biology, is interested in one, appar-
ently mundane object of research: tree holes.
What exactly are tree holes? They are hol-
lowed-out depressions in crooks of tree limbs
where water collects. A wide variety of
organisms lives in these pools, and they are
the subject of Dr. Paradise’s research. He has
written almost twenty articles on these and

other ecological subjects during his profes- .

sional career.

Dr. Paradise developed his fascination
for tree holes while growing up in the state of
New York and attending Albany University.
He honed his research while holding down
instructor positions at Penn State (where he
also earned his Ph.D.) and King’s College in
Wilkes-Barre, PA. He came south to David-
son to “live in a small town,” and, ofcourse,
to teach and study the many trees on campus.
In the six years until he comes up for tenure,
and probably lorg afterward, Dr. Paradise
will always be looking for a few brave souls
to help him.

While Dr. Paradise was born, raised, and
educated in the north, Dr. Jennifer Keith has
lived all over the country. A visiting profes-
sor of English, she has lived in New Jersey,
Ohio, Washington D.C., and Florida at one
point or another. After receiving her B.A.
from Rollins College, in Florida, and her
Ph.D. from Emory, Dr. Keith went abroad to
teach in France for four years. She then
returned to a position at UNC Greensboro.
She is on a one-year leave from UNCG to
teach at Davidson.

Over the course of her career, Dr. Keith
has published several articles on eighteenth-
century British literature. At present she is
researching how eighteenth-century women
writers represented nature and the sublime.
Next semester, Dr. Keith will teach a 300
level course on expanding the senses.

Dr. Russell Crandall is one of the newest
additions to Davidson’s Department of po-
litical science. Dr. Crandall was born in the
San Francisco Bay area and attended college
at Bowdoin in Maine. He proceeded to com-
plete his master’s and doctoral degrees at
Johns Hopkins University.

Dr. Crandall brings a wealth of experi-
ence to the political science department: He

Davidson discovers Paradise, other nev

worked with human rights i issues in Colum-
bia and taught grade school in Honduras. He
also helped shape economic development

policies in the country of Peru. Along with —

his enthusiastic interest in Latin America,
these experiences and others define Dr.
Crandall as one of the premier educators of
international politics at Davidson. More spe-

cifically, Dr. Crandall sites his intellectual -

interests as the Andes } Mountains — in

South America.

On the lighter side, Dr. Crandall enjoys
backpacking, fly-fishing, a good run, ‘and ry
cooking. ‘Dr. Crandall joins Davidson be-

cause he wants to help students benefit from .

a liberal arts education, much like the one he
experienced as a a student.
