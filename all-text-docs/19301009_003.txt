Wildcats Win Third Game
‘Shutting Out Seceders

Erskine Defeated by Score of 21-0
When Davidson Team Over-
whelms Their Attack

GOAL LINE STILL UNCROSSED

Joe McCall and Don King Play Out-
standing Game

Coaches “Monk” and “Tex” added an-
other shutout victory to their string last
Saturday when their 1930 edition of scrappy
Wildcats outclassed a game eleven from Ers-

kine College, 21 to 0. Joe McCall, bril-
liant Davidson back, added another long run |
to his personal list when he sped through |
the entire Seceder team, sprinting 74 yards |
for a touchdown on the second play of the |
game. The fans settled back expecting to |
see a slaughter, but the sturdy Erskine
defense began to function better, and they |
repeatedly thrust back the Davidson eleven |
when it seemed inevitable that they would
score.

The Wildcats were able to gain at will
through the fighting line of Seceders, but
always some mishap near the enemy goal
prevented more scoring. At the same time,
the Wildcats presented an impregnable for-
ward wall that repeatedly thrust back the
Erskine running attack, their longest run-
ning gain being one of eight yards by Hood.
As a consequence, they were forced to re-
sort to the air, and at one time reached the
Wildcat 25-yard line.

Aside from the brilliant run of McCall,
a 39-yard run by Mills was the feature of
the day, but Brohard, hard punching full-
back of the Wildcats, was the most consis-
tent gainer of the day, never failing to chalk
up creditable yardage on the numerous oc-
casions when he carried the ball. The first
real sustained drive of the game, coming in
the latter stages of the second quarter, gave
Davidson the second touchdown. McQueen
led the way and was ably assisted by Mc-
Call and Mills. From midfield they marched
with uninterrupted progress down the field,
and Don McQueen skirted right end for the

_needed distance. For the second time, Thad
Brock showed old-time form in converting
the extra point.

The fighting Seceders held the Wildcats
scoreless in the third period, but were un-
able to thrust back a drive in the final quar-
ter. Mills got off his 39-yard run, bringing
the ball to the 17-yard line. A five-yard
penalty against Erskine brought the ball to
the 12-yard line and Captain Fraley passed
to Proctor for the score. Fraley kicked goal
for the extra point and the game ended soon
after with the ball in Erskine’s possession
on their own 40-yard line.

Gettys was the Erskine star, playing a
great defensive game throughout. Carr and
Hambright also showed up well for the Se-
ceders.

Inter-Fraternity Sports
Planned for Next Week

Football, Basketball and Baseball
Sports in Which All Fraternities
_Will Take Part

Next week the fraternities of Davidson
will start their competition for the fraternity
championship of the college. This year there
will be three major sports, football, basket-
ball, and baseball, in which the teams will
compete. These sports will be run off in
tournament form, the fraternity winning the
most sports or gaining the most points will
be given a loving cup.

Points will be given to the winners in each
of the sports; a certain number of points
will be given to the winner, the runner-up,
and those in the semi-finals will also be
awarded points to count toward the final
standing. Also points will be given to the
fraternity with the greatest number of men
out for the varsity teams of these three
sports.

The first sport that will be run off is touch
football, which will start next week or the
latter part of this week; the next one sched-
uled is basketball, which is scheduled during
basketball season; the last one, baseball, will
also be run off during its season.

Last year there was no cup given, but the
championship of the fraternities was won by
the Beta Theta Pi, who won both the foot-
ball and the baseball championships.

Most of the captains have been appointed
and have their teams organized. The captains
are as follows: Sigma Phi Epsilon, C. E.
Bettis; Pi Kappa Phi, P. S. Knox; Pi Kappa
Alpha, R. K. Gregory; Phi Gamma Delta,
Alec Montgomery; Beta Theta Pi, Hugh
McMillan; Theta Upsilon Omega, Charlie
Kraemer; Kappa Alpha, Taylor Marion;
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Ed Gorham; and
Kappa Sigma, not appointed. These captains
will meet and decide the drawings of the
tournament. Captain Pritchett and Heath

Tilt With Oak Ridge

Walton and Gold Lead Teammates
in Amassing 32 Points

It was a well-oiled Oak Ridge football
team that invaded the lair of the Wildkit-
tens last Friday and emerged from the fight
with a 32-0 victory over the Freshmen. Scor-
ing in every period of the game, the Cadets
from Oak Ridge were early seen to be the
superior of the two teams. With a forward
wall that averaged about 185 pounds to the
man and a backfield that was probably
heavier and very fast, the Cadets sifted
through the Kittens’ line and secondary de-
fense like so much water and once they came
into possession of the ball it was generally
only a matter of time until they crossed the
goal line.

Although the whole Oak Ridge team was
good, most of the scoring can be attributed
to the work of one man, Walton, who, every
time he carried ‘the ball, gained a consider-
able amount of ground, Sharing honors with
Walton was his running mate, Captain Gold,
who was a constant ground gainer.

The whole Wild Kitten team fought un-
til the last whistle but it was just too much
Walton plus Oak Ridge. The outstanding
players for the Frosh were Wilson at right
tackle, Slaughter at guard, and O'Keefe at
end. The novelty of never having played_to-
gether showed in the play of the Freshmen.

Oak Ridge showed its margin of superi-
ority by 23 first downs to two for the Fresh-
men, which came as the result of penalties.

Cross Country Team Is
New Feature This Year

Two Meets to be Arranged for
Listance Runners

For the first time since 1927, Davidson is
to have a cross-country team this year. This
team is to be composed of six members only,
who will probably be selected from those
who ran the distances last year.

It is hoped that two meets may be ar-
ranged but as they are now only tentative
and as several schools are on the list at
present,.it is impossible to state either the
dates or the names of the teams we will
meet in these contests.

The other activities in fall track are
scarcely more than a means of keeping those
track men who are not participating in any
other sport in condition for the regular track
season in the spring. In this type of work
it is impossible to judge who will be out-
standing next spring, because several prom-
inent men of this sport are in football work
at present.

Professor Raymond Moley, of the Depart-
ment of Public Law at Columbia Univer-
sity has recommended that a broader edu-
cation be accorded students studying to be
lawyers.

Duke at Durham Saturday afternoon at
3 p. m. Second Big Five game.

The Davidsonian Wildcats looked
better against Erskine than at any
time this season. True the opposition
was not as strong as might be wanted
but there undoubtedly was class writ-
ten boldly in the way that line charged
‘and the manner in which the backs
drove and drove. Especially during
the first half did Davidson impress the
fact that she is going to be the team
to be reckoned with this season.

the surprise of the
week-end. Undoubtedly the Blue
Devils have the material, but their
play against South Carolina would
never have revealed it. Reports of the
game with the Cavaliers say that De-
Hart’s men were working like a ma-
chine and that the interference for the
backs mowed down the opposition.
‘We do not doubt that that was true. |
Last Thanksgiving Duke presented
the prettiest offensive seen by us dur- |
ing the entire season. Time after. time |
it would carry them down the field to |
within the shadow of Davidson's goal.
They were able to run up 22 first
downs and most of them came from
straight football, as Sam Buie’s passes |
went only in Davidson receiver's

hands. |

Duke’s unexpected showing against |
Virginia was |
|

In sharp contrast to the showing of the |
varsity last week was the play of the
freshmen against the powerful Oak Ridge |
squad. There is no denying that Oak
Ridge was the better team and that the |
Wildkittens were playing their first
game, but even that does not wipe out |
some of the errors. The line could not get |
going consistently at any time and the |

|
|

backs were snowed under by the Ridgers’
forwards. |

The play of Slaughter, guard; Pratt and |
O’Keefe, ends; Wooten center; and West |
and Brown, backs, looked good at times. |

We believe that Unger and Laird will |

jlook like this to us:

land the Freshmen out of their lethargy
in the next two weeks, and that an en-
tirely different looking team will meet the
Wofford Fresh ten days from now.

The only game we missed last week
was the Duke-Virginia encounter. The
Blue Devils gave the dope bucket a
lusty kick to hand the Cavaliers a 32
to 0 lacing. Davidson beat Erskine 21
to 0; the guess was 20 to 0. Carolina’s
margin over V. P. I. was 18 points, the

’Gators vindicated our faith in them
by exactly what we figured, and Wake
Forest failed by a touchdown to come
up to our expectations over Furman,
though won easily. Our record for the
season is nine correct out of eleven.
