“Cassidy’s double gave us confidence
and we went from there,” said Stu Sloan, who
went 4-for-13 from the plate in the first four
games.

The Wildcats eventually tallied a 16-2
victory, their first of the season. In the second
game of the Sunday double-header, Tim Frend
delivered some late-game heroics when his
single with the bases loaded drove in Jack
Purcell and Ben Brown. Friend’s two RBIs
put the Wildcats on top for
good, 5-4. Pitcher Wes Self
claimed his first victory on
the season after relieving
Mark Wells. .

The first game against
Mount St. Mary’s on Satur-
day was a disappointing 2-1
loss forthe Wildcats. Ryan
Stroker’s two-run, six-
strikeout pitching perfor-
mance shined for 5-1/3 in-
nings, but the Wildcats’ of-
fense couldn’t get started.
The team recorded just four
hits during the game and
only five men on base in the
first five innings.

“We just couldn’t hit
well,” said Lundin follow-
ing the disappointing loss.

at home against the Panthers from High Point,
who edged out the Wildcats 4-2. High Point’s
John Cavanaugh drove home what would be
the winning run with a RBI single in the fifth
inning.

Although the Wildcats sported a nine-hit
effort, none of their bats.connected at oppor-
tune times. The Wildcats had no hits with the
runners were in scoring position and no one
batted past first base. In his first game of the

season, pitcher Wes Self struck out nine bat-
ters in 5-2/3 innings but allowed the four runs
that High Point needed for the victory.

The Wildcats traveled to Duke Wednes-
day, but the results of the matchup with the
Blue Devils were not available at press time.

Davidson returns home to face VMI in a
three-game series Feb. 19-20. The Keydets
will be Davidson’ s first Southern Conference
opponents of the season.

O’Brien Honored

At right, Jen O’Brien is awarded the game ball from the
Wildcats’ Jan. 5 game against College of Charleston in
which she became the all-time leading scorer in
Davidson women’s basketball history. Athletic Director
Jim Murphy presented O’Brien with the ball during an
awards ceremony that preceded the tipoff of the Wild-
cats’ Feb. 7 home game against Western Carolina. “It’s
been a pleasure to play with Jen the past few years,”
said teammate Katy Kamp, who ranks fifth on the scor-
ing list. “It means a lot to be part of her success.”
