Together with incoming

Representative John M.
Bevan, Spencer appeared at a
Union sponsored Open End
Monday night to answer
questions concerning the
future of Davidson's athletic

program. -

While the majority of
questions dealt with the future
of Wildcat football, of prime
concern to many of those in at-
tendance was the plan to
upgrade the ‘‘minor sports.”’

Spencer and Cartmill both
stated that the college is
definitely committed to the
improvement of such sports as
track, but indicated that
change made will have to
come slowly and at the
initiative of those involved in
these sports.

$25,000 was put into the
minor sports at the request
last week. We need to evaluate
each sport in to
what we need - evaluate minor
sports’ staffs and develop
them,” said Bevan.

“The new system of football
funding will remove the
method by which football
eclipsed the importance of
the minor sports,’’ Bevan ad-
ded. ‘‘We are looking to
upgrade the minor sports
rather than just to cut the
budget.”’

Cartmill predicted that the
total athletic budget would
probably be cut little, if at all
saying that money will be
needed as much as it was
before.

athletic teams, football,
basketball and all of the minor

DC PIRG Completes Survey
On Local Gasoline Pricing

By ALEC HOON

The Davidson _Chapter
of NC-PIRG began its in-
vestigative. operations during
the week of October 19-23 with
a gasoline survey of 57
Stations in the Davidson area
to determine prices and oc-
tanes.

The results of the just
released survey indicate that
the overall lowest priced
stations were the 7-Eleven and
Ole stations in Cornelius
and the Hi-Val-U station in
Mooresville.

“But this information
should be of value to you in
buying gas, and perhaps, it
will have an impact on
gasoline prices in the area,”
he said.

priced stations were 7-Eleven
and Ole in Cornelius. Hi-Val-U
south of Mooresville, and
Savaton north of Charlotte.
Perhaps significantly neither
7-Eleven nor Ole had their oc-
tane ratings posted.

The most expensive regular
gas was Milledge Gulf on US
21 at 1-85.

The lowest priced middle oc-
tane was Smith’s Sunoco's 93
octane ‘220’ brand. Smith
Sunoco is on NC 115 just north
of Davidson. Savaton's
“premium 500’’ was also an
inexpensive middle octane.

minor sports may be in-
creased if the funds permit it.

“We're not sure how our
contributors will react to the
decision. Some may give less,
some more. We'll have to wait
and see,’ Spencer said.

He also noted that there is
little if any chance of the
basketball program going in
the same direction as football
has moved.

“The Trustees were em-
phatic in their intention that
the basketball program
remain at the national level
and that it is not the next step
in a total switch to a ‘‘need”’
system of athletic scholar-
ships,"’ Syencer said.

Bevan explained that the
Southern Conference has no
rules regarding the number of
football games a team must
play.
“A team has to play five
games to be eligible for the
Conference championship,”
he said, ‘‘but there is no rule
that says we must play a set
number of games for con-
ference membhership.”’

Cartmill stated that even if
Davidson did leave the
Southern Conference, the
basketball program would not
be affected.

The three administrators
left a feeling that they felt
Davidson's athletics future
would be an improved one.
However, that feeling is not
universally held.

which sold it was Ramey Tire
(Gulf) in Mooresville. Gulf
was the only regular.

The most expensive low lead
gases were at American
stations in Huntersville and
Mooresville. American,
though, has lead free gas
ener than only being low in
ead.
