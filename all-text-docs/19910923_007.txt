Depth! Relevance!

Middle Page Interview:
On Column Writing and Column Reading

The Depth! Relevance! Soci-
etywould like to welcome this week
Dr. Will Drivelon, noted column
analyst and observer of the small,
liberal arts campus scene. Dr.
Drivelon wishes. his kids went to

' Davidson.
: D/R: Dr. Drivelon, why are you
here?
Dr.:1 fear that the art of the column
may be dying, especially when I
read the Charlotte Observer. This
pains me. At Davidson, however,
columns outnumber trees. The
dynamics behind this subtle Ren-
aissance fascinate me.
D/R: Well, they do say enough
columns have flamed out in the
Davidsonian to light a computer
screen. But specifically, Dr., what
journalistic work or works interest
/you?,
Dr.: “Rude Notes II: The Back-
wash”, especially last week’s in-
stallment, I find absolutely intrigu-
ing. The author zeros in on the
* inter-sexual stratagems. which
define not only social existence at
Davidson but, I feel, Davidson
itself. He juxtaposes “girls” with,
surprisingly enough, “guys” and

rides the ensuing wave of psycho-
logical insight to a realm of truth
before unprobed.

D/R: We atthe Depth! Relevance!
Society also noticed this juxtapo-
sition (which we admit fairly bulges
with humorous possibilities). Un-
fortunately, however, we discov-
ered no humor in the author’s pres-
entation.

Dr.: Your organization’s problem
revolves around the fact that, like
most humans today, you all do not
know how to read. The petty and
inconsequential baggage of humor
burdens a quality piece of colum-
niation. (The author of “Rude Notes
I” sometimes stooped to this level.)
The columnist’s responsibility is
social insight. Such insight dem-
onstrates correspondence with

one’s community, grips the reader, |

and (hopefully) makes society a
better place to live. I find Mr.
Rude’s social eye and consequen-
tial vision stunning.

D/R: In what way?
Dr.: Mr. Rude presents the reader
with the essence of the Davidson

Student: a fun-loving, condom-

bumpered incubus (or succubus

- lest one accuse me of gender bias
(don’t forget the “P-whip,” heh,
heh)). If students can deal with

David
"Pundit" Scott

each other at this honest level,
campus life will benefit immeas-
urably.

D/R: Exactly how might we bene-
fit from this burst of understand-
ing?

Dr.: Mr. Rude’s hypothetical ques-
tion from a female student, “How
come guys don’t ask me to their
cocktail parties?”, I think will re-
lieve your doubts. He answers “Are
you kidding? We’ ve gotimports to
finance. Did you really think dat-

‘ing wasas simple as staying within

this county? Sheesh.”

Sheesh, exactly. Social rela-
tions will deteriorate until “chicks”
and “boys” can be honest with one
another about the crucial role of
imports, Queenies, Big Hairs,
Mattresses With Spunk, or (in the
opinion of some female Davidsoni-
ans) Large Mosquitoes in Davidson
life.

I remember in a study I con-
ducted a few years ago a Davidson
freshman (male) described to me
the large busses which pull up to
various houses along the court at
odd times during the year. These
busses came from schools com-
posed entirely of females or, even
better, from Big State Universities
where they have Sororities. He
described wide-eyed the wonder-
fuland mysterious things, real thing
things, that he imagined or had

impinge on anyone’s First Amend-
mentrights, or to encourage policy
forbidding flyers. We wish only to
perhaps instill a greater sense of
responsibility in the student body
for their actions and words.

Many of us chose Davidson
because we were searching for a
liberal arts education that would
open our minds toa great variety of
peoples and traditions. To reject
one group or idea as undeserving
of respect is surely in contradic-
tion to the purpose underlying such
an education. As the Council on
Minority Affairs pointed out in
last week’s paper, the gay commu-
nity is denied any support on this
campus. How frustrating it must
be for those who wish to live in an
open, supportive environment
whenattitudes suchas the one seen
in the flyer saturate our campus.

Racism, sexism, homophobia,
and any other form of prejudice
springs from either fear or igno-
rance. As we can safely assume
that the majority of us here are not
ignorant, we must deduce that fear
lies at the heart of these attacks.
What is it that we are all so afraid
of? Are we so insecure with our-
selves that we have to degrade
others in order to feel we measure
up? How sad that ina place known
for its spirit of community we are
unable to exercise tolerance for
those who fall outside of the norm.

One of the most courageous

| _ actions we as humans can under-

take is to open our minds and learn
to be accepting of other people, in
spite of their differences that once
seemed threatening to us. Let us
not dwell on the standards we are
all pressured to conform to in a
larger group. Rather, we should
strive to move forward and up-

heard went on when these busses
and our houses merged. The ease
with which these things occurred
fascinated him most.

The intellectual atmosphere
surrounding such conceptions as
well as Mr. Rude’s concept of the
import assumes three things: 1)
thatsuch outsiders are stupider than
Davidson women, 2) that such
outsiders are a lot stupider than
Davidson women, and 3) that (af-
ter 87 beers) such outsiders look a
lot better than Davidson women.
Davidson students should not skirt
such vital factors in the Dating
Game. As Rude commented,
“contraceptive sponge? uuuuhh. .”
D/R: Thank you, Doctor. It seems
the Depth! Relevance! Society may
need to amend our resolution con-
cerning Mr. Rude’s work.

Dr.: Really? What was that?
D/R: Last week we voted unani-
mously that we would like to see
Mr. Rude pick up his (in his own
words) “three month old Trojan”
from the laundry and carefully slip
it over his pen.

Dr.: Oh, small-minded world!

ward as we learn to accept each
other as individuals.

The next time you are about to
tell a slanted joke or use a racial
slur, stop and think about what is
motivating your actions. Are the
laughs you elicit worth the pain
you inflict? Starting today, let us
all make a conscious decision to
chose courage over fear, love over
hatred, and unity over division.

Sincerely,

Courtney Nichols

human beings regardless of sexual
orientation. In addition, fear of

‘being labeled a homosexual is at

the root of homophobia itself.
Homosexuals. deserve to be
treated with the same respect any-
one else on this campus receives,
and Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s flyer
surely did not promote this
idealogy. In fact, it was a blatant
display of discrimination.
Passive acceptance and igno-
rance must be stopped. Until this

_ issue is addressed and people at-

tempt to understand that this is not
acceptable, such displays of homo-
phobia will continue.
