New Church To

Have Everything

Chimes, Lounge, and Kitchen Sink

The Davidson student body this year is seeing the fulfill-
ment of a dream which has long been on the minds and in the
hearts of all those connected with our college—the construction
of a new church, the nucleus of the religious life on the campus.
Since it is of particular interest to the student body, the David-
sonian has gathered news of general interest about the church.
so that each student may be informed as to the progress of the

structure which will serve as

The $700,000 building was designed
by Thomas and Wagoner of
Philadelphia, nationally known ar-
chitects who specialize in the pian-
ning of churches. The contractors
‘are Thompson and Street of Char-
lotte, who have also built, through-
out the past years, the library, the
science building, and the gymnasium,
all of which are familiar sights to
the Davidson student.

Construction of the edifice, begun
last summer, is proceeding accord-
ing to schedule. Almost all! the
steel is on the grounds, and the
limestone, being shipped by truck
from Indiana, is expected to ar-
rive on time. It is hoped that the
church will be completed by next
summer.

The church sanctuary, which will
face north toward Shearer Hall,will
seat about 1150 people. It will in-
clude the chancel, which will seat
a choir of $0 persons, with the pul-
pit to one side of this chancel, and
a lectern, from which the Scrip-
ture will be read, on the other. In
the tower of the church will be
electronic chimes, which will be
played manually from the organ
now under construction in Buffalo,
N. Y., or from the clock which will
be located in the tower.

The chapel, with a planned seat-
ing capacity of about 200 persons,
will be located across from the Col.
lege Pharmacy, facing Main Street,
and is designed for many uses
where smaller groups will assem-
ble. On the Southeast corner will
be a large student lounge, also
planned with seating space for 200
persons, which may be used as a

A Marriage Course

Helps YourChance Cheering At

Chapel Hill, N. C.— (IP)—-There
are fewer divorces among couples
who took courses in marriage and
family problems while in college
than among graduates who did
not take such courses, surveys
made so far reveal, according to Dr.
Reuben Hill, who teaches such
courses at the University of North
Carolina.

Dr. Hill, who is professor of so-
ciology and research professor in
the University’s Institute for Re-
search in Social Science, cited re-
cently the results of a survey made
by Stephens College in Missouri
and the marital experiences of his
own students.

There are now between 600 and
700 colleges and universities giving
courses in marriage and family
problems, Dr. Hill said. The cours-
es have changed a great deal in
the last 25 years and they are def-
initely accepted in most’ institu-
tions now as an essential part of
the curriculum, he said.

Before coming here last fall, Dr.
Hill taught marriage and the fam-
ily and allied courses in the Uni-
versities of Wisconsin and South
Dakota, Iowa State College, and
Teachers College, Columbia Uni-
versity. He directs the University’s
graduate training program for stu-
dents of the family pioneered here
by the late Dr. E. R. Groves, who
inaugurated such courses at Bos-
ton University in 1924 and here in
1928.

The courses have changed a
great deal in the last 25 years and
they are definitely accepted in most
institutions now as an_ essential
part of the curriculum, Dr. Hill
said. :

‘The first instructors in such
courses labored under many diffi-
culties, for the subject was sur-
rounded by a hush-hush atmos-
phere,” he said. “Discussion of fam-
ily problems in college was regard-
ed as a sort of sacred cow. It was
not long, however, before such
courses gained popularity. During
one three-year period more than
100 colleges and universities estab-
lished courses in marrage and the

family.”

Athletic Contests and Pep Rallies

Is Directed by Monty Hill and his Spirited Squad

To seven men goes the credit
for developing one of the most
spirited student bodies in the
South. These men are the David-
son College cheerleaders. Theirs is
the spirit and guidance that has
brought life to our campus. There
are few students who do not rea-
lize that the cheerleader is the driv-
ing force behind school spirit, but
most of them are unaware of the
work necessary for the development
of a good cheerleader. To put the
vim and pep into a group is not
as easy a task as it may seem, for
not only does a cheerleader have
to have good verbal qualities but
also good physical co-ordination.
Activities on the campus are an-
other important asset that tend to
to make an even better cheerleader
for he then comes in closer con-

tact with the group that he leads.

Wax Scratching

By BOB WHELESS

After reading my column last
week some of my readers (both
of them) dropped by my room to
ask about a vocalist named Sarah
Vaughan. I ‘had stated that she
would be one of the stars whose
new recordings would be reviewed
this week, and these characters had
the gall to ask who she is, For the
information of anyone else who
might still be living in the dark
ages, Sarah is one of the greatest
vocalists in the business. She does
for a song what Jane Russell does
for a sweater. If you want to see
what I mean listen to her waxing
of “As You Desire Me”, or one of
the numbers she has made with
Billy Eckstine, or better still, one
of her more recent recordings for
Columbia “I Love The Guy”. Sey-
eral companies have cut that last
tune, but none measure up to Sar-
ah's version. Next time you're in
a record shop remember to listen
to “I Love The Guy”"—You'll like
it.

Nat King Cole can add ‘‘Orange
Colored Sky” to his long list of
hits. It’s definitely headed for one
of the top spots on the hit parade,
and the way it’s going it won't be
long in getting there. Nat cut this

the “D” Club, and Sigma Delta Psi. one with Stan Kenton, and when

’ Anotlier senior is Al Cooke from
Decatur, Ga. Al is a member of
Phi Delta Theta, a member of
Sigma Delta Psi, and plays varsity
basketball. :

A junior member of the group

is Bruce Ballenger from Charlotte,
N. C. He is a member of Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, the track team, and
Sigma Delta Psi.
« Another junior ts Kric Clark from
Etizabethtown, N. C. He is a mem-
ber of Kappa Sigma and is vice-
president of the Junior Class.

Rounding out the cheerleading
squad is Jinks Jervey, a sophomore
from Greenville, S. C. Jinks is a
member of Pi Kappa Phi.

his smooth 88ing is combined with
a few whoops and shouts from the
Kenton aggregation along with
Kenton’'s blaring brass section the
finished product is strictly top qual-
ity wax. The flip side, a little thing
called “Jambo” isn’t anything to
get excited about, but the “A” side
makes this a worthy addition to
any collection. Before we leave
Nat, some mention of another of
his new releases should be made.
This one, is called “Home” and un-
like “Orange Colored Sky” it is
the slowly dreamy type etching
which he does so well. Although
it’s a retread from quite a few
years back, that King Cole styling
gives it enough lift to carry it. a
long way. Give it a listen.

Decca has a new star in Don
Cherry who cut .a tune labeled
“Thinking of You.” You've prob-
ably heard it quite’a few times over
the radio, and from all indications,
it’s just starting. This Cherry fel-
low has quite a voite and unless I

miss my guess you'll be hearing

quite a bit about him from now on.

George Shearing, the blind Eng-
lish pianist who came over to this
country last year has made a new
recording of an oldie for the M-G-
M Label called “When Your Lov-
er Has Gone.” It is done in the
same smooth, rythmic boy styling
that has made him one of the lead-
ing bop artists in the nation. Even
if you don't like most bop my
guess is that you will like it as
played by Shearing.

One of the leading tunes of the
day in the soft, smooth, and senti-
mental field is Paul Weson’s “Nev-
ertheless.” It’s so great that I'll
go out on a limb and say that in
a months time it will be holding
down the number one spot on the
record ‘hit parade. Paul never fails
to turn out ear appealing music and
this is definitely Weson at his
best in choral work as well as or-
chestration.

In searching for the right words
to describe “I'll Never Be Free”
by Kay Starr and Tennessee Ernie
1 find my vocabulary extremely in-
adequate. It’s getting to be very.
popular, and there’> no doubt but
that Kay is a fine singer, but still
what to say about the record? It
isn’t pretty, and the lyrics aren’t
cute or tricky, but still there’s
something about it that keeps you
from flipping the dial when it’s
played. I'll just say that it's differ-
ent and let it go at that. You listen
and see what you think.

Patti Page’s “All My Love” isn’t
moving quite as rapidly as was ex-
pected when it was first released.
It can't be denied that she does a
rather nice bit of vocal work on
it, but actually it isn’t anything to
stand up and shout about. Mindy
Carson's “The Touch Of Your
Lips” is in about the same boat
and if anything a little worse off—
it has the same old June-Moon
idea, and just can’t get started.

Decca‘s new etching of “T. D.’s
Boogie Woogie” has proved to be
a shot in the arm to the Dorsey ag-
gregation. This is not a re-release
of the old arrangement, but a
swell revamping job which may in
time become more popular than
the old version which was at it’s

height back in ‘43.
