Gridders Out for Revenge in Opener Against Guilford

By Chris Hood

In June, head football
coach Dave Fagg wrote a flier
which he distributed among the
staff and players when they ar-
rived for fall training camp. “Care
enough in ’92,” it opened. A num-
ber of goals were spelled out on
this sheet, but there is one which
has the immediate attention of the
Davidson football program: Sep-

tember 5, 1992 - 1:30 p.m.
The ‘Cats, coming off a
4-5 1991 campaign, open their
1992 season at Richardson against
the Guilford Quakers, 8-2 a year
ago, this Saturday. The two teams

met a year ago in Greensboro in a
contest Davidson dropped 21-3.
This season, the ‘Cats
look to use experience, an exciting
“run-and-shoot” offense, a pun-
ishing defense and strong special
teams toimprove against what Fagg
called “as tough a schedule as I’ ve
been around.” The ‘Cats’ first four

_ Opponents were a combined 30-6-

4 last year.

Success in ’92 will de-
pend largely on the abundance of
leadership experience of this year’s
squad. The roster contains 11 se-
niors, including a quartet of fifth-
year seniors. In all, 19 starters re-

turn for another season of football.

On the offensive side,
where Davidson returns nine start-
ers, the ‘Cats will rely heavily ona
huddle-less run-and-shoot forma-
tion. Senior Richard Howell, who
completed 46% of his passes for
757 yards and five touchdowns
and added 270 yards and five touch-
downs on the ground, and sopho-
more Kevin Holzworth, who threw
for 483 yards and four scores, will
most likely share duty at the helm.

A number of receivers
will have many opportunities to
show their talents. Last year, se-
nior John Bodkin pulled in 377

yards’ worth of passes while scor-
ing three times, and junior Kelly
Shirley added 333 receiving yards
and six touchdowns. After missing
much of the ’91 season with an
injury, senior Dan Lamar should
regain his prominent position in
the ‘Cats offense.

With the new offensive
format, much of the backfield’s
focus will revolve around the air
attack. Shane Mills, who scored
four touchdownsand led Davidson
rushers with 327 yards as a new-
comer last year, will primarily catch
passes this season. Senior Mike
Wright returns after tallying 326

yards on the ground; sophomore
Bruce Bannister, who ran for 288
yards and three touchdowns be-
fore sustaining a season-ending
knee injury, looks to regain his
early-season form.

Four of five starters are
back to anchor the offensive line.
Juniors Jack Barry and Rob King
and seniors Nathan Fenwick, the
‘Cats 1991 Offensive MVP, and
Ashton Loyd musthave solid years
if Davidson’s offense is to be pro-
ductive.

Field Hockey Faces Tough Challenges 11 in 1992 Campaign

By Jennifer Roos

The 1992 field hockey
team is very excited for the start of
its season. It will have to endure
the most rigorous campaign in
Davidson history, but nine starters
return to undertake the unyielding
schedule. In addition, the Wildcats
are faced with repeating as cham-
pions of the Deep South Confer-
ence for the third straight year.
“Threepeat” is on the mind of ev-
ery team member.

Four of the teams on the
seventeen-game schedule, Duke,
Virginia Commonwealth, Radford
and James Madison, are in the na-

tional top twenty, while three oth-
ers, Ohio University, Kent State
and Central Michigan, are top Mid-
American Conference compctitors.
This is the type of schedule which
Davidson hopes to play each year.
The expectations are very high for
this season despite the schedule
because the Wildcats are used to
success. They followed a 14-1-2
recordin 1991 witha 10-6-1 record
last season.

The Wildcats will look to their
strong senior class, Monique
Dockter, Simone Plaisance, Jenny
Plowright and co-captains Jenni-
fer Roos and Jacquelin Ukrop, for

New Coach Leads
Volleyball Into Southérn
Conference Competition

By Bruce Balestier
The Mimi Plauche/Holt
Hathaway era in Davidson volley-
ball is over. Plauche, an outside
hitter, and Hathaway, a setter, led

the Wildcats for four years, begin- -

ning with the early days as the
“Freshmen Connection,” and
helped the program to a higher
level each year. Davidson earned
records of 31-6 and 25-13 and con-
secutive Big South regular-season
titles in their final two seasons. As
if to make it a clean break, coach
Rebecca Hawkins left Davidson
this summer as well.

Hawkins turned a fledg-
ling club team into a formidable,
program in the region in her five
years onthe job, and Carolyn Blake
has been hired to continue the pro-
cess. In addition, Hathaway has
returned to the fold as an assistant
coach. Blake, though little more
than two years removed from her
graduation from Wake Forest, pos-

sesses an impressive volleyball
resume, beginning with-her-high
school playing days in Newport
Beach, Ca. After winning a 5A
state championship at Corona del
Mar H.S., Blake headed to Wake
Forest to continue her playing ca-
reer. But when the Deacons’ pro-
gram was dropped after her fresh-
man year, she turned immediately
to coaching. Blake coached the
team at Bishop McGuiness H.S. in
Winston-Salem from 1987 to 1989,
leading it to a conference title in
1987. She spent the last two years
as anassistantat Williamand Mary;
during that time, the Tribe went
45-19 and twice made the National
Invitational Volleyball Champion-
ship. _

At Davidson, Blake in-
herits an experienced team used to
being led by Plauche and
Hathaway. Blake thinks she has

Davidson will look to

tage. The Wildcats will have eight
home games, many of them against
teams used to playing on artificial
turf. The team hopes to use this
advantage, in conjunction with its

defensive game, to knock off some
