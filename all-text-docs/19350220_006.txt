4 : ° THE DAVIDSONIAN,

FEBRUARY 20,

1935

Noted Pianist

(Continued from Page 1, Col. 3)

“Jazz will leave its’impressions in mu-
sic annals, but I doubt whether it will
be a deep or lasting impression, as jazz
is shallow and of little worth as real
music. Many modern American com-
posers and some! European composers,
namely, Ravel and Tansman, have at-
tempted mingling jazz, or suggestions of
jazz, in their works, but none except
Tansman has been overly sucessful in
their attempts.”

“Do you think teaching produces a mu-
sical decline in the teacher?”

“In my case, I do not find it notice-
ably so, as I give very few concerts dur-
ing my teaching year, but when a.man
has to devote himself to several sides of
music, and not to his specialty, it does
produce a decline.”

“Whom do you consider the greatest
pianist of the day?”

“That’s a difficult question, but I be-
lieve I would say Horowitz. This man
has attained a new level. In other words,
he has accomplished things that pianists
have hitherto thought impossible. But,
of course, that does not mean there are

‘no greater heights to reach.”

“How do you think the piano com-
pares with other instruments?”

“That, too, is a difficult question. It
is plainly visible that the piano cannot
carry a sustained tone or a tonal quality
like some instruments, but the piano can
utilize more than one or two notes at a
tite. The whole keyboard is at the fin-
gers of the pianist. Then, too, this in-
strument is absolutely necessary to so
many other instruments as accompani-
ment or background. It is somewhat a
question whether orchestral effects can
be obtained as in the organ, for instance,
but I believe that, to some degree, the
piano does have the power.”

Then, on leaving, I couldn't resist pull-
ing an old stock question on a man with
such boyishly friendly ways.

“What are your hobbies?”

“Well, I'm so busy during my teach-
ing year that I have very little time for
anything else. I always buy a faculty
season ticket to athletic events with the
intention of attending all the contests,
but I never succeed. Last year, I saw
all the football games, but I missed the
basketball season entirely.”

Then after a lighter vein of conver-
sation, I left, somewhat reluctantly. It
is a distinct pleasure to find as accom-
plished a musician with a pleasing per-
sonality such as pis. He exhibited no
reticence{jn answering my questions, but,
instead, a boyish eagerness to express
his opinion. Such a type of man ele-

yates the general opinion regarding mu-
sic and the musician.

Doc Charley

(Continued from Page 1, Col. 2)

A Story is told by Captain Pritchett
of “Doc” Charley during that memor-
able game with Wake Forest in 1932,
in which the 'Cats gained their first Dea-
con scalp for several years. It was in
the third quarter and the Deacons were
pouncing “that thin, red line” for all a
Demon Deacon was worth. “Doc”
Charley was in the corridor under the
stadium praying.

Enoch, another Wildcat of the darker
race, says that Charley was a good boy.
Enoch is his step-father. “I raised him
until he was twenty-one, told him to do
What was right, and he went on his own
hook after then. ‘Doc’ Charley was al-
Ways on the job.” Thus spake his father.

“He learnt me my ABC's, We went
to Sunday School together and was
taught by Davidson boys. He got me
my job.” And this time it was HuJohn,
Charley’s half-brother. HuJohn remem-
bers back in the days of the old Medical

’ School here how Charley used to scare
him, telling him that the spirits of the
dissected “corpses” would get him if he
didn’t do tight.

As nearly as can be calculated, Charley
was born in 1887, the son of Mary Wil-
son and Ed: Johnson. His father died ;
and his mother re-married; and young
“Doc” came under the care of Enoch,
He lived in Mecklenburg County all
his life and received bits of his educa-
tion at a negro school, taught by a Mr.
Baker and Rey. Brody.

In his early life he attended a Sunday
School taught by Davidson students and
was later a faithful deacon of the col-
ored Methodist Church across the tracks.
He married about 18 years ago and has
one daughter, married.

He was a friend of. Wildcats in two
senses, being the only one whom “Felix,”
the college mascot; would allow in his
cage. Home-coming days he was one
of the first to be hailed by alumni of
all age and vintage. Athletic directors
here praise him for his unswerving loy-
alty. Enoch says of him that wherever
he went he had a friend.

Sunday afternoon he received his wife
and HuJohn at the hospital and seized
HuJohn’s hat to keep him from leaving.
He wanted to go home and called for
Dr. Oren Moore and Captain Pritchett,

Funeral services were conducted this
afternoon at the negro burial ground
near the golf course.
students and alumni gathered to pay

their respects to this darkey friend.

Craig Talks

(Continued from Page 1, Col. 1)

ing,” in which Bacon says, “The opinion
of plenty is among the causes of want.”

“We are so prone td be satisfied with
our present positions that, our opinions
of plenty are contributing to our causes
of want.”

In passing onphe réad the first of four
propositions which were in line with his
subject. It was, “The past is not dead
and can not safely be allowed to die.”
In contrast with this, Dr. Craig said he
viewed with no alarm the tendency of
modern youth to act as it does, Every
two generations has had its modern
youth question. He quoted several writ-
ers of .the past on the subject, conclud-
ing. finally that youth will not bear the
last generation's burdens until it becomes
imperative; they prefer to kick just as
long as they can.

One of his most arresting thoughts in
connection with the first proposition was
that we can learn to consult the opin-
ions of the best minds of the past by
reading and studying what they wrote.
His illustration was that if he were
properly trained, he could, by a study
of Woodrow Wilson’s writings, probably
discover what he thought about the ques-
tions confronting our present-day gov-
ernment. We can learn to interpret
others’ minds if we only train ourselves.
It was rather a new note to hear a
speaker at Davidson refer to the War
President as Woodrow because of per-
sonal friendship, or as Dr. Wilson, since
we are likely to forget that the former
Davidson man was also a college presi-
dent.

The second proposition was, ‘‘Learn-
ing must be taken seriously.” We should
have a definite idea of what we are
working toward and then do our best to
achieve our goal. F. J. Childe, who has
done such outstanding work in bringing
Americans to a better understanding of
the popular-ballad,-is-a-man who has ap-
plied this proposition.- Childe has done
some of his work in the North Carolina
mountains where there. are Still to be
found some of the old folk ballads.

The third proposition, “The modern
world ought to determine to stand out
from the crowd.” Little men and ordi-
nary men become lost in the crowd, but
truly great men never are. This is an
age of wiseacres, or pretenders to
knowledge, but they are destined not to
rise above the crowd.

The last proposition was, “We must
devour the serpent of enchantment.”
This, he explained, was a deference, also
from Bacon, to what he called Mose’s
serpent, but which we know better as
Aaron’s serpent which devoured the ser-
pents of the enchantors of Egypt.

“Learn to think individually, and do
not let the world do your thinking for
you,” he said.

In closing, Dr. Craig made the follow-
ing statement which he said he offered,
for the thoughtful
consideration of students and faculty:

“ry

without comment,
The progress of our race is due to ad-
vance of science.” Keep in mind _ his

earlier definition of science.

and his sponsor, came through the door
in, the heart.

Each sponsor received her gift from
Miss White, the president’s sponsor.
When all of the participants in the fig-
ure had been introduced, a colorful spec-
tacle was presented. As a grand finale
to the figure, those taking part began to
dance in the midst of colored spotlights,
and flickering little lights representing
stars coming from a polyhedronal re-
volving light hanging in the center of
the room from which white and red
streamers were stretched.

The orchestra played “Stars Fell on
Alabama” in an enchanting, subdued
tone that brought. more than one “oh”
from the audience. The dance contin-
ued then until two o’clock, when it was
closed with a remarkable arrangement
of “Good Night Sweetheart.”

Kappa Sigs
(Continued from Pagé 4)

The Kappa Sigs are making a strong
bid to retain the Inter-Fraternity Ath-
letic Trophy, held by this fraternity for
the last four consecutive years. Kappa
Sigma and Sigma Phi Epsilon entered
last night's contest with 27% points each
toward this year’s supremacy in sports as
a whole.

On Monday night the tentative start-
ing line-ups for Tuesday night’s game
were:

fee Sig 8. P. E.
Hugh Gracey Forward Jack Jenkins
Hank Loftin .. Forward ...Martin Barnett
Ben Rose ..... Center Charlie Yager
“Booty” Wingfield Guard Dudley Elvery
Billy Ravenel Guard “Dopey” McCall

Reserves for the Kappa Sigs were an-
nounced as Fritz Byerly, Tom Morrison,
Jewell McLaurin, and Bob Sours; for
the S. P. E.’s, Ray Gilks, Jim Knox,

Frank Taylor, Bob Orr, and Henry
Lyons.
Opinion was, on the eve of the con-
flict, that the teams were evenly
matched.

Meet March First

(Continued from Page 4)

Parker and Bill Deyerly seeking to re-
place Pratt and McPhail at the hurdles.
Dickson, Pierce and Byerly will handle
the sprints. George Gullette will again
work in the distance runs.

Brightening the rather disheartening
losses of the varsity squad will be the
unusual possibilities in the freshman
team. Coach Whittle announced this
week that the outlook for a successful
freshman track team is brighter than
for several years.

An early look-over of the material
shows Wade Barrow a prospect for the
sprints and the hurdles, John Grimm in
the 440, Parcell in the mile, and Paul
McLanahan, q transfer from a junior
college and therefore eligible for fresh-
man track, a good prospect for the half-
mile.

Other men who have had good high
school and prep school records are
“Red” Freeman_in the weights, Monroe

Wicker in the hurdles, and Leonard Fort,
brother to the renowned wrestler, Charlie
Fort, at the pole vault.

Both the varsity and freshman teams
will enter the U. N. C. indoor track meet,
March 9. They will enter the events
open for non-Conference schools.

Wade Barrow, stellar forward captain
of the 'Kittens, now leads the team as
high scorer, having piled up 69 points
during the season. Close on his heels
is Bill Kieswetter, who has a total of
62. Third in order is Lawrence Reid,
co-captain, with 28. Other high scorers
are: Bill Harris,“ 26; Dan Iverson, 18,
and “Max” Reinhardt, 13.
