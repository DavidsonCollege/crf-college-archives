In Competition
VETERANS ON TEAM

Ludlam, Thompson, and
Lofton are Alternates

Tuesday night, January 10,

the varsity debating trials
were held in the Eumenean

Society Hall.

The judges were the members of
the faculty committee on debating,
which consists of Prof. E. J. Er-
win, Dr. C. K. Brown, and Dr. W.
P. Cumming. The question for de-
bate was: “Resolved, that the Unit-
ed States should cease to use Public
Funds for the purpose of stimulat-
ing business.”

Out of the eighteen men who tri-
ed for positions on the varsity, six
regulars and three alternates were
chosen. They are as follows: Sher-
rard Rice, Joe Calvin, Locke White,
John Reisner, Bob Ramsey, and
Dick Kenyon. The alternates are:
Bill Loftin, Drury Thompson, and
Warren Ludlam.

The subjects for this year’s de-
bate will be: The Alliafce of the
United States with Great Britian
and the subject that was used for
the varsity and freshmen tryouts.

There will be three major trips
for the team this year. Two regu-
lars and one alternate will make
the trip assigned. The first tour will
be into Virginia and on up into
New York and Massachusetts; the
second will be into Kentucky and
Ohio; and the third will be an ex-
tended trip into Georgia, Florida,
and Alabama.

With the exception of two men
Davidson has the same team that
was here last year, and they are
looking forward to a successful sea-
son.
