Wanted: Code of evaluation

A professor is called to a meeting
with President Spencer and Vice Presi-
dent Zimmermann, but, in violation of
the College Constitution, she is not told
that matters of evaluation and contract
renewal will be discussed with her at
that meeting.

Students are called in to Zimmer-
mann’s office to discuss their profes-
sors, but the atmosphere is one of a

‘social chat’ and some students are not»

aware that their comments are part of
evaluations to determine the status of a
professor’s job.

The administration claims to place
great weig n ‘the recommendations
of senior fairy members who work
closely with the teacher under evalua-
tion; yet the positive recommendations
of at least three senior professors are
disregarded in the evaluation of one
teacher.

A professor’s contract is renewed in
1976, and from that time to the day
when her contract is terminated, the
administration never suggests to the
professor that the College is dissatis-
fies with her level of competence.

Described above are some of the
procedural irregularities common in the
administration's evaluation of Dr. Tonia
Devon, an outspoken and energetic
Davidson professor whose contract was
terminated recently.

The irregularities evident in the Devon
evaluation point out plainly that David-
son College has no careful and com-
plete procedure by which to judge the
competence of its faculty. Without such
a procedure the College’s efforts to
encourage good scholarship and obtain
truly outstanding teachers is crippled.

The criteria by which professors are
evaluated should remain somewhat
non-specific. It is unwise to attempt
numerical quantification ‘of: teaching
effectiveness, professional competence
and reputation as a teacher and scholar,
and involvement in the community.

These criteria may be flexible; the
procedures by which those criteria are
judged must, however, be highly speci-
fic. Davidson must have a. codified
procedure for evaluating faculty mem-
bers; a code that stresses continuing
evaluation and an ongoing commitment
to improvement. n

—,

At present, all evaluation activity is
channeled through the office of the
Academic Vice President. A new code
of evaluation should solicit greater
faculty input in the evaluation process,
perhaps through a faculty committee on
Appointments and Evaluation which
would conduct evaluations independent
of the Academic Vice President.

Any new code of evaluation should
also seek input from students through
course and instructor evaluations.

Where there should be a code of
evaluation there is now a void. In that
void thrive rumors of administrative
vendettas against outspoken faculty.
and charges that Spencer and Zimmer-
mann make arbitrary decisions accord-
ing to their particular whims.

Until the void is filled with a thorough
code of evaluation, academic profes-

sionalism will be tainted by rumors of

_inconsistent administrative. procedures
and vedettas, and the goal of obtaining

a truly excellent faculty will be unattain-
able.

Opinion

Pritchett lauded

By BILL BARNETT
Senior Editor

The editorial page is not
usually thought of as the place
to voice comments about
sports. Instead, it is the place
for serious thoughts and criti-
cism of such earthshaking
problems as whether or not
Davidson should have a
Homecoming Queen. Now,
however, it is appropriate to

- turn to sports.

For example, Basketball
Coach Dave Pritchett has been
criticized by many people on
campus. He has been called a
quitter by some, while others
have merely criticized the logic
which led to his selection as
coach. ‘‘How could we have
chosen such an unstable per-
sonality?” cry the cynics.

Such criticism is unfair and
unmerited. Certainly Pritchett

has made some mistakes, but:

on the whole, he has done a
good job and should be looked
upon as an inspiration for the
whole campus.

Pritchett came onto the
scene when the basketball
program was at an all-time
low. The returning players
were forlorn and dejected —the
latest coach had left after
working with them for only
four days.

Within months after Prit-
chett’s arrival, the players’
spirits had perked up. With-
out making any brash predic-
tions, Pritchett quietly let the
whole campus knows he was
going to be a winner.

Last season Davidson lost a
lot of games, but the. mood of
the team never fell. Indeed, it

may have picked up. For

many of the students here,
last year’s thrilling 72-70 loss

| to Wake Forest, was the. first

chance they had ever had to
rally behind a sports program
which would be a winner.
Pritchett’ worked hard last
spring and brought in some
stellar recruits. All the signs
indicated that this year we
might have a winning team,
and after that, who knows?
Maybe we would even get
back into the Top Twenty.
What was truly exciting,
though, was that the students
had something else to be
proud of besides academics.
Academics are great —they are
the main reason we are all
here. No one would deny that;
however, academics certainly
don’t add much spice to
college life. The grind of a
pre-med curriculum is a lot

easier to bear if you can relax

occasionally, have a beer in
the Union, and discuss the big
win over Furman.

Davidson certainly has no
reason to be ashamed of Dave
Pritchett. He turned our bas-
kétball around more quickly
than anyone dreamed pos-
sible. If we are on the road
back to the Top Twenty, it is
almost solely due to his influ-
ence.

Get Well Soon petitions a
now being circulated around
campus to send to Pritchett.
Hopefully they will cheer him
up and he will return to a job
in the Athletic Department at
Davidson. His enthusiasm,
drive, and infectious spirit
would certainly be welcome.
Sign a petition if you would

might encourage the Adminis-
tration to redouble its efforts
to find a good new coach who
could complete the job Pritch:
ott started.”
