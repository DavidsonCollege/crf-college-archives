Gridders smash through UNC lines

The Club Football team
arrived in North Myrtle Beach
Good Friday for the league’s
Beach Tournament, and went
right to work preparing for a
tough weekend. The enthu-
siastic players could soon be
seen running happily about
the beach, exercising (their
elbows especially), making all
the necessary plans for a
victorious weekend, and gen-
erally getting in shape for the
game in body and in spirit.

Saturday afternoon saw the
16 Davidson players matched
against a heavily favored UNC
team. Several of the Wildcats
had only been with the team
since the start of the Spring

term and many of the players
are freshmen, but this ‘‘well-
prepared”’ Wildcat’ team was
to completley dominate the
game.

The Wildcats scored first in
a ‘‘fake screen right, screen
left’’ to halfback Ron Rosen-
berg. This was soon followed
by defensive lineman George
Brown, returning a fumble for
a touchdown. Fullback Paul
Henschen added another six
points before the half ended,
giving the Cats a 18-0 lead.

UNC had been unable to
move against Davidson’s awe-
some defense, captained by
linebackers Tony Boone and
Tim Sellers. By the end of the
game, the defensive backfield
had three interceptions—two

“Cheaters never win”

Yesterday, the Girl’s Tennis
Team lost to a powerful Clem-
son team by a final score of
7-2.

Davidson's #1 player Kirk
Cameron commented after-
wards on the difference in
competition between this year
and last. ‘‘Our team was
comparable in talent last year,
but with the increase in wo-
men’s scholarships at
opposing schools, it is getting
harder and harder to com-
pete.”

She cited one example where
the University of South Caro-
lina will change their four
partial scholarships to six full
scholarships next year.

Yet, Kirk stated that she
really enjoys the hard compe-
tition. She only wishes that
the same friendly atmosphere
could still prevail on the court.

But with the increase in
scholarships, Kirk notices that
her opponents tend to be more
obnoxious and harder to play
with since they fear losing
their scholarships.

“This year some girls have
even started to cheat more,”
she remarked.

The Davidson squad is an
extremely athletic bunch with

ting in at least one other sport.
Kirk indicates that all the
girls are really close, and they
have a lot of fun together.
‘‘Sometimes we’re really
crazy together. We even sing
in the van after matches.”’

Frank Callcott. Both defen-
sive and offensive play. by the
Wildcats were outstanding.

Davidson's final score came
early in the third quarter, as |
Paul Henschen bulled up the
middle for another T.D.,
giving the Wildcats a 24-0
lead. ‘

Chapel Hill couldn’t cross
mid-field until late in the last
quarter, after a penalty and a
good ‘‘scamper!’ by their half-
back. The Cats dug in on the
10 yeard line, however, and
held UNC for their last four
plays of the game.

The team was jubilant after

victory’’ (or whatever).

After this good showing,
the Cats look hopefully to this
