Ed. Note: From, 2p.m.
Friday until 2p.m. Saturday ten
Davidson men ran 254 miles in a
continuous relay. Their total
broke the North Carolina state
record of 237 miles set here in
1973, and earned over $700 for
the Ada Jenkins Community
Center and other community
service projects.

The following is a log com-
piled by one of the runners
during the relay.

2p.m. Coach Martin fires the
gun and Ricky Bell leads off as
‘“‘Whammer Jammer” plays, a
repeat of the start two years
ago.

2:50p.m. Eighth man Coty
Pinckney is first to go under 5
minutes with a 4:57, as all but
one of the first ten miles are un-
der 5:35. First ten mile split is
52:47.

3:00p.m. Bob Lautensack
just ran a 4:47, fastest mile yet.
Hey, Bob, are you crazy?
“Yeah,” he truthfully replies.

3:45p.m. Of the first 20 miles,
only three are over 5:30. Our
second ten mile split is 52:19 as
everyone starts.to pick it up a
little.

4:30p.m. Coty Pinckney just
ran 4:48, his third straight mile
under five minutes, as we
record 52:27 for the third set of
ten miles.

5:30p.m. Dick Boehner
breezes to a 4:47, tied for best
mile, right after Coty’s 4:48, as
fourth set of ten miles takes
54:20.

6:00p.m.. Bill Cole runs his
fifth consecutive 5:19.’ I think
the people timing are starting
to cheat and are giving him
5:19 regardless of what he does.

7:15p.m. Our sixth ten mile
spit is 52:43, better than the
53:52 we had on the fifth set.
Cole blows it with a 5:17. I
a they aren’t cheating after -
a

9:00p.m. Ohno! Cole just did
another 5:19. Coty continues to
amaze everyone with his
seventh straight sub. five min-
ute mile.

Jock run

3:30a.m. Our 13th, 14th, and
15th ten mile splits are 55:06,
56:21, and 56:10, as everyone
except Coty is slowing down a
little. Coty runs his 15th straight
sub 5:00, running a 4:52 in the
annual ‘‘jock run.’’:

4:30a.m. Fatigue, the dead of
night, and few spectators com-
bine to slow things even more.
Even so, we’re still so far ahead
of the pace we could average
just 6:00/mile and finish with
255 miles. The 16th set of ten
miles is on 60:55, the first over
anhour. Zack tops Coty by run-
ning a 5:37 wearing only a hat
and a pair of spikes. He is
paced by a fully nude pre-med.
5:15a.m. Only four. people
now helping out. Boehner has to
drop out after 18 miles due toa
leg injury. That means we have
to run with five minutes less
rest each time now. Everyone
else seems to be holding up well
and looking forward to daylight.

6:20a.m. Coty runs his 18th
straight sub 5:00 mile at dawn.
Our 17th ten mile split was
59:28, and the 18th was 59:05,
still under the 10 mile/hour
pace.

8:30a.m. Ricky ‘‘the Lube”
Deal completes the 200th mile
and we stop for two minutes to
have our pictures taken.

We slow slightly to a.53:16 for
the seventh set of ten miles, and
54:52 for the eighth set.

10:00p.m. Cole walks the last
five yards so he can record his
eighth 5:19. Dick runs a 5:03
while Olivia Newton-John sings.

That would make anybody run

faster. Mark Connors continues
to run exceptionally well, con-
sidering he’s a_ sprinter--he’s
doing 5:30’s. Our ninth ten mile
split is 53:45.

11:00p.m. Zack Murrell runs
5:19 for the 100th mile. We’ve
been running nine hours now, so
we’re already an hour ahead of
240 mile pace. Two years ago

_we weren’t an hour ahead until

12 hours into the relay.
11:30p.m. There must be 50 to
60 people here now, watching a
dog catch a frisbee, throwing a
football, and standing around
talking...
12:30a.m. Our eleventh ten

~ mile split is 54:45, but Bell goes

under 5:00 and Coty does so for
the twelfth consecutive. time to
lower our twelfth split to 53:45.
1:30a.m. Three streakers run
a 440 with Bozo Bill Cole and
liven up the coed crowd of 30 to
40. Chuck Sudetic continues to
run quiite well, especially con-
sidering he has hardly trained

for this thing. But he’s crazy -

enough to do it, and that’s what
it takes. There are some guys
out here doing a good job of

* pacing us now, too. They’re as
y

crazy as we are.

2:30a.m. - ‘“‘Hasn’t anybody
gone over six minutes yet?
Connors asks. ‘‘Well. I’m going
to do it.’’ He runs 5:33. The first
mile in over six minutes comes
a little later. after 138 straight
over the mark.

End in sight

11:30a.m. The last few ten
mile splits have been a little
slower ranging from 58°05 on

’ the 20th to 62:51 on the 23rd, the

slowest yet. The end is in sight
now, and there’s no question
that we'll break 250 if every-
thing goes OK. Coty goes 4:57
for his 21st straight mile under
five minutes, an amazing per
formance.

12:18p.m. Connors completes _
the 237th mile which breaks the

old state record set by us two.

years ago. More people are
starting to come to see the
finish now, which gives us quite
a lift.

1/30p.m. Coty runs 4:52, his

through Senate funding, but on
the whole, the effect is not that
great.

John Munce said jokingly at
the end of the last meeting that
as long as Brad Swalwell kept
typing the Senate could stop
meeting.

Unfortunately Munce was
righter than he thought. It
would be a mistake to say the
Senate can’t do anything, but it
wouldn’t be too far off to say the
Senate isn’t doing anything.

Until the college lets the
Senate exercise some power.

23rd mile under 5:00 (his other
three were less than 5:11), and
then paces Zack on the 250th
mile. We record 58:18 for the
25th ten mile split.
1:45p.m. Bell runs 4:51 on his
27th mile, which turns out to be
his fastest. That shows what
