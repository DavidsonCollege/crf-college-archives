“DON'TS.”

The following series of “Don'ts,”
written by Prof. Franklin H. Giddings,
of Columbia University, are copied from
The Educational Review for February,
1917. These suggestions apply espe-
cially to upper classmen and graduate
students:

1. Don’t say “between” when you
mean “among.” Look up these words
in the dictionary.

2. Don't say “consider” when you
mean “regard” or “think” or “view.”

3. Don't say “co-ordinate” when
you mean “correlate.” Look up these
words in the dictionary.

4. Don’t say “differentiate” when
vou mean “discriminate” or “distinguish
from.”

5. Don't say “due to” when you
mean “attributable to” or “on account
of” or perhaps something clse. “Due
te” is inaccurate and slovenly.

6. Don't say “during” when you
mean “in.”

7. Don’t say “eventuate” when you
mean “occur” or “happen.”

8. Don’t sav “motive” when you
mean “move” or “force of motivation”
when you mean “motive.”

9g. Don’t sav “phenomena” (plural)
when you mean “phenomenon” (sin-
gular).

10. Don't forget that “none” is a
contradiction of “no one” and takes the
verb “is,” not “are.”

tr. Don't say “people” when you
mean “individuals” or “persons.” Neith-
er fifty Kaisers nor fifty “wops” are
fifty people.

12. Don’t say “point of view” when
vou mean “view” or “opinion.” The
phrase “point of view” is now and then
both accurate and useful, but it should
be employed sparingly, ”

13. Don't sav
you mean “social” or “psychological”
when you mean “mental” or “psychical,”
or “hiological” when you mean “or-
ganic” or “vital” or “physiological”
when you mean “physical.”

14. Dont’ overwork “hence.”

15. Don’t begin as many as ninety-
five per cent of your sentences with
“thus.”

16. Don't sav “startling fact.”

“downward path.” “step bv — step.”
These phrases are stigma of the ex-
horter.

17, Don't sav “T will” or “T would”
when vou mean “T shall” or “T should,”
and don't say “vou shall” or “you
should” or “he shall” or “he should”
when vou mean “vou will” or “you
would,” or “he will” or “he would.”

18. Don’t split infinitives.
