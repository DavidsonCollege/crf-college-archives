Lovett combines ego and madness

By JEFF MORROW
Staff Writer

If you really want to hear
about it the first thing you ll
probably want to know is if
John Lovett was the offspring
of a Minotaur and an Estonian
antelope.

But between grunts he does
speak English and you begin
to realize that indeed he is
human so it is logical to

» -conclude that his parents were

human, also.

But enough of his heritage.
What we are concerned about
is his excellence in perfor-
mance, especially last week,
on and off the rugby field.

Lovett, combining ego and
madness, has mortally woun-

ded some three hundred play-
ers, both on Davidson and the
opposing teams since the fall
of 1973 when his four-year

Lovett
career began.
Known as “‘bullheaded Lov-
ett’? John has suffered some

four 01 uve concussions since
1973. ‘“‘I think it’s really
macho,’’ said Lovett, ‘‘to
speak tackle without a hel-
met.”

Last week’s game against
an experienced Danville team,
Lovett scored the only “‘try’’
for Davidson and displayed an
excellence in knocking down
people.

When asked about how his
body was able to withstand
four years of violence and pain
Lovett replied, ‘“Didn’t Freud
say that happiness was no-
thing but the remission of
pain? So the more pain the
intenser the happiness.

“But there is a prior origin
to this, and the psyche makes

pain on purpose. But anyway,
I’m really into happiness, so
that’s why I love pain so
much.”’

Lovett’s performance in the
annual “Washington Sevens
Tournament”’ in Washington,
D.C., was outstanding. Al-
most singlehandedly he kept
Davidson in the tournament
with feet flying like a Mac
truck and his mouth frothing
like the finished product of a
Schlitz brewery.

Lovett has recently had
second thoughts about. a pro-
fessional career in rugby and
has decided to study this week
so he can go to medical school.

He will be sorely missed
next year on and off the field.

Gozinyas finally whack Off Again

By BAD BERNARD
and

HOGMAN
Bernie and Hogman are un-

usually high this week due to
the signing of a superstar
guard, Chris Dodds, by Big
Daddy Dave. Now if we can
just sign the big kid from
down in Gray we will all be
chewing on cigars for the next
four years. Do it up, Cats.

The softball world was
turned upside down this week
as the derelicts from the
Gozinyas (Goes out you, too)
whacked Off Again, 4-2. The
Gozinyas were boosted by
Soto’s high powered arm and
Stick’s typical mediocrity.

After the game, Hogman
had a chance to interview star
center fielder for the Gozinyas,
Mark Sumwalt. Walt had this
to say about his team’s chan-
ces for the pennant, ‘‘Well,
man, you knowpswe are all,
ahh, you know, in it} man, and
you know, man, ahh, any one
of, ahh, five teams could, you
know, win it all.”

San Fernadino Pasquale’s
Pizza Hut de Soto has been
named our IMAC athlete of
the week and he will receive 15
8’’ x 10” color glossy photos of
Bad Bernard and Hogman.
Autographed, of course.

For Off Again it was their
first consecutive straight loss

in a row with a win. Get down,
Duke, Pine, and Flash.

Bernie and Hogman would
like to apologize to all the
gorgeous coeds (all five of you)
for not giving you better
sports coverage this year. The
big coed game of the week
found Killer Watts and the
Little Boogiers actually show-
ing up to engage in serious
competition. The score gyra-
ted one way and then the other
as the game grinded on, until
it reached its inevitable cli-
max, with the Little Burgers
going down, 4-3. More coed
scores later.

In other softball play this
week, two more top ten teams
clashed as KA #1 met SPE #1.
The SPE’s excluded the KA’s
as they eliminated them, 7-4.
Too bad ’am, Percy.

Presto’s Grill remained un-
defeated behind the fabulous
pitching of big Jon Lee Hart
and the arm of Rob Murray.
The Grill fried two opponents
this week and vaulted into our

second spot.

As of this printing two
important games will have
been played this afternoon. #2
Presto’s met #6 Flaming A’s
and #1 Gozinyas met #5 Your
Face. Call 376-3231 for all the
scores.

Stedman Lyles and Pat
Dulany set an IMAC record

‘this week as they combined to

consume 107 beers during
their game with Last Rites.
Stedman and Pat were buried
immediately following the
game.

The SAE’s jumped from
37th to #10 this week as they
beat the do-do out of EMBO
and Chocolate Speedway.

The E’s shagged 45 runs
and 31 fly balls in the con-
tests. Baby Rick’s Bar and
Grill remained in dur terrific
ten this week as they ran by
Wee Willy and the Wahoo’s,
19-6. Nobody played well in
the game.

It is of no concern to anyone
that the Goodwinites ahd Ed’s

In volleyball the young boys

emerged with three different
teams that are currently the
number one teams in three of
the five divisions. But no one
will know for sure until the
tournament is over just who
the winner will be.
