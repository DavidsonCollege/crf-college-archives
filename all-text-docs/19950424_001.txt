ter week at Davidson. From meal-
time chat to Humanities discus-
sions, students and faculty ex-
pressed divergent interpretations
of the symbols.

Early in the week before Eas-
ter, members of InterVarsity, FCA,

and the Ecumenical Council (EC)
placed three crosses in front of
Chambers to celebrate the death
and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
FCA President Bo Bartholomew
explains that the task was taken on
by individuals with the support of
the FCA and IV.

Later inthe week, sophomores
John Harmon, Dan Parham, and
Charlie Hearon erected a fourth
cross and a bunny.

According to Bartholomew,

the purpose of the three crosses

Saatents dish out suber anaes of fun Son os the Court. Rob Kosiki

By MATTHEW Erricu
Assistant News Editor

The Board of Trustees during
their retreat this weekend approved
the Council on Campus and Reli-
gious Life’s (CCRL) revised alco-
hol policy. The council and com-
mittee structure has been a behind
the scenes force affecting the de-
bate about independents and the
Court.

The Alcohol Policy Review
Task Force (APRTF) is commis-
sioned by the CCRL to review the
alcohol policy — only — both on
the Court and off. The APRTF

makes recommendations to the
CCRL, chaired by Shandley. The
CCRL then makes recommenda-
tions to the president who recom-
mends the plan to the Board of
Trustees for ultimate approval.

None of these committees and
councils are directly responsible
for the plan to charge indepen-
dents; that plan was proposed to
and in the Patterson Court Council
(PCC) which is responsible for
implementing Court policy
changes.

The CCRL determines, ac-
cording to Patterson Court Advi-
sor Kurt Holmes, whether the risk

Trustees approve CCRL’s alcohol policy

management guidelines are afford-
able. The PCC is then required to
finance those guidelines.

PCC interests were repre-
sented officially and unofficially
on all of the committees and coun-
cils.

On April 11 the CCRL met to
discuss, amend, and eventually
approve the APRTF’s recommen-
dations. The CCRL’s recommen-
dations concern the Court as well
as affairs off the Court.

At Court parties, students will
be required to wear a wristband
