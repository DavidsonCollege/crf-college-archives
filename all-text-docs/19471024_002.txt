— Consider this: After coping with secon:
dary schools in the publie edacation system

to approach allananner of learning with one
eye on the grade he will get. and the other

agnexistent and the student had little or no
choice concerning what he wonld take durtig
nis stay in college. In the past two genera-
tions. however, the concensus of opinion
among educators has made the pendtihum
swing toward the opposite extreme. so that —
foday the student has alniost unlinitéd
choice as to what he will take.
Because of the elective system_ the
present day college does not seem to offer
1o its students any well organized and in-
“tegrated body of facts. | mean that it is
a simple matter for the modern stident to go
through most Liberal Arts Colleges and Uni-
versities in the country and come out know-
ing nothing other than his chosen and spe-
cialized field. Thus, a student may matricu-
late al a college, spend four vears there. and
vraduate without being aware that meu like

were other than famous pendants, or that

would undoubtly be of aid in understanding

or that a_course in musi¢ appreciation would

of Liberal Arts do not contain a department
of fine arts.
Mn many ways it would seem that the
“pregent college graduate is an individual who
—has successfully passed 120-125 semester
hnonrs in the most expedient possible mauner.
and whose principal recommendation is thal _
he has acquived a considerable hodgepodge —
of almost entirely unrelated facts, Colleges
—Frow-a-davs seem trai if they havea welll

make a living and -little else. One would
think that the pure problem of earning a
living could generally be handled by the
vocational, technical and eradtate institu-
tious, leaving the Liberal Arts Sehools the.
task of wiying the student a broad general”
background in all fields of learning. Ju this
‘way the student would he prepared t-spe-

What the student lacks is a perspective.
He is unable,torwarious reasons, to see the
relationship of what he leams in one field of
knowledge to that in a second field. ‘To em-

predominate without realizing that mere-in-—

ferent peoples in different ages. the day of

~ Given the benefit of the doubt, the
averave college student may be characterized
“as lazy. but not stupid. With this considera-
tion in wind, it may be concluded that he has

lraditional conceptions of the matter, in find-

Ignoring the.reasons why he clecided to come
to a Liberal Arts College (since they are so
often concerned with matters of couvention
or expediency rather than with intellectual
development), let it he assumed that he con-
siders itehis purpose to apply himself for four
years in “learning the avt.of living.’ This
is to be facilitated by the college, which_
should provide him with a methad for dip-
ping into the several branches of learning.
He will soon discover that there are various
erave obstacles to the realization of his aim,
which are posed by the nature of the institu.
tion in which he is enrolled, Granted that the
inteHectnal is not only the sphere of educa-
tion, two of these obstacles applying to this

_sphere ave cansidered below. They are_by-no—

means the only pertinent ones.
