Davidson Union Director C.
Shaw Smith released Monday
the names of the performers in
the 1977-78 Artists Series, and
the list promises to be a
biggie.

Performing first, on Sept-
ember 5th, hopefully before
anyone arrives, will be the
Oscar Mayer Ocarina Ensem-
ble from Oshkosh, Wisconsin,

Outdoor classroom

a 17-man group composed of
up and coming talents on
ocarinas and slide flutes. Ac-
cording to Smith, ‘‘This mer-
rie bande hath played in béer
halls and high school gyms
across the country. It should
be a night to remember.”
Next, on November 23,
during the exam period, will
be Das Wunderkind, an avant-
garde dance troupe from
somewhere. Under the direc-

is versatile indeed

“Versatile.”” In a word this
is how Academic. Vice Presi-
dent Frontis Johnston des-
cribes the new outdoor class-
room located behind Martin
Science Building near Jackson
Court. (‘‘That is where it is,
huh?’’ commented Johnston.)

Although not yet comple-
tely finished, many uses are
already planned for the gift of
the class of '76. Captain
Outlaw, head of the ROTC
department, expressed inter-
est in using the facility.

‘‘Tt’ll make a great laun-
ching pad!” observed the cap-
tain. ‘‘Why, with this, we can
send manned flights as far as
Princeton; hell, who knows?
Maybe even as far as Wil-
liams!”’

Registrar Richard C. Burts
has already requested use of
the architectural wonder for
drop-add. “The suggestion of
never-ending circles leading
nowhere lends just the atmos-
phere we need.”

Alumni Relations Director
Zach Long has non-academic
plans for the brick disc. ‘‘Well,
we wanted to make it sort of a
miniature Stonehenge out of it
on Alumni Weekend. Local

chapter presidents would be
dressed as druidic priests with
other alumni dressed in Wilde
D. Catte loin cloths (on sale
now at the Student Store).
And of course, there'd be
plenty of flowers and booze,”
added the grinning Long.

New head basketball coach
Dave Pritchett expressed hope
that the new facility could be
used as a reception area for ali
the returning players from last
season’s squad.

College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr, summed up other
possible uses for the gift.
“Well, the religion depart-
ment, especially Dr. Polley,
has expressed interest in using
it for a ritual sacrifice.” ©

The art department already
has designed a seminar to
study the classroom. It will be
titled ‘‘Advanced Brick Archi-
tecture with Emphasis on
Circles, 252. ‘‘We had to
convince Dr. Labban that he
could not make a scale repro-
duction of the Temple of
Dionysus; I’d like to, but
Williams hasn't got one yet,”’
said Spencer.

“All these ideas are great,
but personally I think it’d be
swell for a big horse race, or a
big old beer blast,’’ he added.

tion of choreographer Kitty
Litter this group performs
modern dance routine based
on lower mammalian mating
rituals. ‘‘Particularly beauti-
ful,’’ said Fred Spitzman of
the Missoula, Montana, Bu-
gle-Herald-Sun-Daily-Record,
‘is the ‘Cheez Pleez’ number
in which the entire cast mimics
Norway rats in heat, transfor-
ming the stage into an ethereal
{trash dump in midsummer.’

On January 1, Davidson
will be entertained by ‘‘Truck
Patch,’’ a musical group who
play only instruments made of
food. Their tour was late
getting started this year due
to a tardy harvest, but the
reason is now in full swing,
and their talents have graced
already towns such as Fludd,
Texas, and Pelzer, South Car-
olina. Featured in their act are
such country-renowned art-
ists as Hortense Bush on liver
pudding, Maxwell House on
the five-stringed squash, and

Dew U. Wanna on the wind-
burger. Conductor A. Bob Ar-
eebob, still recovering from an
in-concert injury caused by a
flying watermelon seed, said
that ‘‘our group isn’t to be
confused with the ‘Blerider-
tones,’’ a similar group who
perform solely on kitchen app-
liances. No sir!”

Finally, there will be a
performance by “Gnischbk”’,
an acting ensemble who per-
form ancient Latvian drama in
the original language and cos-
tume (which is nothing). How-
ever, since ancient Latvian

drama was performed only on
rainy, odd-numbered Tues-
days in months that begin
with ““Z”’, their performance at
Davidson is not sure at the
moment.

According to Smith, ‘“‘Due
to the high quality of perfor-
mers next year, I’m afraid
we're going to have to charge
students a slight fee of $17.23
for each show. However, so
that the price won’t be a
deterrent, we’ve arranged to
serve Cheerwine and Hostess
Twinkies during each perfor-
mance.”’

GUESS WHAT |!

Those old stereotypes about business edu-
cation and business careers are gone. Today,
you don’t have to be an undergrad business
major to have an attractive career in business.
In fact, our intensive 11-month MBA program
equips people for management positions
whose undergrad degrees range from science
and engineering to the liberal and fine arts.

We'll be on campus:
