Sports RoundUp |

By JULIAN McCALL

What’s the trouble with our basketball team? This seems
to be the question on everyone’s mind these days. The Wild-
eats started off the season as if they were going to do big
things—defeating V. M. I., and playing a beautiful game
against North Carolina, and defeating N. C. State: Here the
trouble started, since then they have won only one conference
game, beating Citadel with “Footsie” Cowan scoring 31 points;
and since then have not come near to winning a game. What
could be the trouble with a team such ours with fine
possibilities—such as Jim Cowan, one of the best centers in
the Southern Conference; and many other able ball players.
It. couldn’t be the coach because we have a fine coach in
Coach Shepherd. But what could it be? Are we not giving
them enough support—this may be the trouble, but. not likely
so—as we have always. supported our athletic teams, win’ or
lose. The trouble may be the lack of interest in basketball
because of the gym facilities we have here at Davidson. The
remedy to whatever it is will come too late now, as we are
already Out Gf-the tournament picttre > so all we can hope is
that our teamt—which is a good team—will snap out of it
for the remaintler of this season and seasons to come. Here’s
hoping. \

FOOTBALL PROSPECTS

Prospects for the coming year in football seems to be
the best that we have had in several years. At present,
the-boys-running-in_practice as a first team will average
about 190 to 195 in the line, and about 175 to 180 in the
backfield. \

There seems to be more round versatility on the team
than in former years. We three triple-threat backs in
Sharpe, Spencer, and Fredricks; two fine blocking backs in
Stan Yoder-and Jay Bolin; and a bevy of fine ball carriers,
such as Hackney, Maloney, Lacy, Shannon, and our three
triple-threat backs, The lne—is-well taken care of by letter-
men Niven and Smith. at ends; Bell and Knoeller at tackles;
Johnson and Marsh at .guards; and, Bahnson and Caldwell
and LBalsley at center. Strandwitz and Crutchfield, reserves,
and-Faison will strengthen the ends; Shaw, Atnold, and Hipp
add to the tackles; \loore and Rainey batk the guard posi-
tions; and, the three lettermen centers seem well fixed.
Coach McLkver and his staff are working hard in an effort’ to
round out a well-balanced and deceptive team, The new plays
put in this year have much more decepition than before. From
interview with a reserve lineman who says that nine tenths
of the time he can’t even tell which’ side of the line the play
Is coming Over, this columnist is able to state that they must
be deceptive. ‘ ’

GOLDEN GLOVES ;

Our two Golden, Gloves representatives, Dick Hudson, and
Buck Powell, although not having the needed experiénce, put
up great fights in the glove’s wars last “week. Hudson seemed
to fare the best of the two—winning his first two fights by
technical knockouts, while losing his third to a much more
experienced fighter by a T.K.O. in the last round. Powell
won his first fight by a well-earned decision, btit lost his sec-
ond by a T.K.O. at the end of the first roynd to a very power-
ful and well-schooled fighter. The winners of open champion-
ships were as follows: Russell Merriman of Florence, Wood-
row Womack of Charlotte, Glenn McCrary of Florence, How-
ard Hettrick of Elizabeth City, Edgar Tyner of .Florence,
Zane Winters of Raleigh, Carlyle 1 hompson of Greenville, and
Fred Hill of Charlotte. These, and all the other fighters that
entered the tournament should be commended for their fine
sportsmanship,-spirit,-and fighting ability.

The Bessemer City contest was
very raggedly played with the visit-

quarter. Davidson subs saw an un-
usual amount of service.

Among the changes are Bahnson
from tackle to center; Arnold from
guard to tackle; and Shaw from
the backfield to~—tackle. These
changes, along with Rainey at
guard and Fredericks in the back-
field, up from last year’s Fresh-

Benny Harrison, consistent forward on the 1940 Wildcat quintet,

finishes out his basketball career this year. Benny, who hails from

Milan, Tenn., is a smooth floor man and deceptive passer as well as
an expert defense man. His ability to feed the ball as well as to

retrieve it from the backboard has accounted for many points this
year.
