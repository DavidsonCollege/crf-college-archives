Desist And Define...

The original intent of this editor-
ial involved commenting favorably on
Richard Chase’s hopes for a folk
theater at Davidson. Then came a
fresh outbreak in the running war be-
tween the administration and the
Vagabonds, and that situation seemed
to warrant editorial comment, but the
outbreak was followed by news that
the Curriculum Committee had taken
action on Davidson’s drama program
for next year. The following is com-
ment on all three items:

A letter from two of the Vaga-
bonds, printed on this page, sums up
the feelings many of the more active
members of the campus drama group
share about the administration. The
feeling of the administration about
many members of the Vagabonds
could be summed up in about as many
words. .

This continual bickering has gone
on long enough. While accomplishing
next to nothing in the way of sustain-
ed improvement in the drama pro-
gram, the dissension has harmed both
drama and the school through the
hard feelings it has generated on both
sides.

All accusations aside, the basis of
the problem appears to lie in the fact
that the Vagabonds and administra-
tion have two very different ideas as
to the role of drama in Davidson's
liberal arts program. The Vagabonds
seem to envision a-semi-independent
full-scale drama program with wide
student participation and a full-time
staff of two or more members. They
belteve that President Martin earlier
this year voiced support for the type
of program they espouse, and that he
has backed out on them since that
time.

We are in no position to pass
judgment on that issue, but an en-
tire bulletin board set up in the Fine
Arts Building would indicate that the
administration’s position on drama is
indeed confusing. It appears that
much of the confusion arises from the
fact that no one is quite sure where
the administration stands on the role
of drama at Davidson. A simple clari-
fication of policy towards the drama
program would hardly solve all the
problems involved, but it would at
least let the Vagabonds know where
they stand. Debate could then turn
from bickering accusations to the
greater question of the role of drama
in a liberal arts curriculum. .

One positive step which has al-
ready been taken is the Curriculum
Committee's decision.(subject to facul-
ty and trustee approval) to hire a man
next year.to handle drama and debate.
This would probably indicate at least
a scaling down of this year’s drama
program, as the combined work of
Drs. Goodykoontz and Drake this year
would be an impossible burden for
one man.

And finally, a word of support
for Richard Chase, a fascinating per-
sonality as well as an outstanding
author and expert on American folk-
lore. Chase hopes to establish a folk
theater in Davidson, and several Dav-
idson students have indicated interest
in staging one of Chase’s favorite folk
plays. Chase himself has offered to
supervise their work, hoping that the
event will become an annual occur-
ence. Davidson's sanction of and parti-
cipation in such a program would be
both a credit to the college and an
invaluable experience for all involved
individuals.

Folklorist Probes Roots
Of America’s Heritage

BY RICHARD CHASE

(Editor’s Note: Mr. Richard Chase is the most popular folk authority living in America today.
He peid Davidson « visit one month ago, and he left the following article to be published in this
peper. Substantially this same writing appesred in the Carolina Magazine in 1933. Yet its topic is
timely today, and will always be appropriate while America exists as a nation.)

What are the roots of our Art? Whence do our streams of culture flow? What is
the blood-background of our souls? “America,” cries Europe, “has no background! She
is a monster of steel and concrete, with no soul, alors!”

The current revival of inter.
est in folk traditions, especially
in colleges and universities, has
tremendous possibilities. Their
return to ancient ways—songs,
tales, music, dances, brought
from across the Atlantic—can
generate a native and vital Ex-
cellence in our shifting, uneasy
era.

Such a development can, in
time, even match what Athens
had. Not a copying of “classics”,
but a deeper realization of our
own vast heritage—‘native, ath-
letic, continental, greater than
before known.”

The true cresters of any
nation’s spirit ere always «
more handful. America’s
grestest ones ere yet hardly
knewn even te herself. Whe
ere they? One “poet” (Whit.
men wes mere then thet, @
true “maker”, cresting beyend
himself and better then he
knew), « sculpter or twe, a
few painters; ne Suripides, no
Wagner.

It is a question of background,
partly, and partly the old bone
of contention—Should Art have

creative import, or be
“for Art’s sake” only?

Surely the broader the basic
social structure of any art the
firmer and more lasting will be
its place in its own intrinsic
uses. Or, to change the figure,
given roots and fertility, a Tree
will by its own vitality grow in
its own Being, flourish, and
bring forth fruits after its kind.

Shakespeare was cuch a
growth. Greek Drama was such.

The fertility of the times
which produced Shakespeare
was due to an inherent and vital
folk-culture which was running
high and unselfconscious in him
and his contemporaries. He and
they lived so intensely they
never thought or cared who
might be “great” among them.
What difference to him whether

his plays were printed or not?
They were alive, warp and woof
with what was his own. The
roots of his Tree went wide and
deep.

Our own times are just be-
ginning. We are just putting
down our roots, seeking our
foundations; our leafy branch-
es are yet to come, our solid
walls yet to be builded.

The music of the future is al-
ready finding itself in young
composers who know that the
high-speed mechanical U. S. A.
has its own hidden “folk cul-
ture.” The drama of the future
is gathering strength from the
same source.

Under the noisy and mechani-
cal surface of our “Civilization”,
interchanging and interpenetrat-
ed, is a threefold basis of some
sort of true and native Ameri-
can Culture; sources, Red,
White, end Black.

This threefold basis is in
each part integral end distinct,
but it is not watertight. Just
because I like mountain music
is no reason why a Negro Spirit-
ual or an Indian Ghost Dance
Prayer should not also have
some comfort for my soul.

But let the Negre build on
his own Fineness thet | may
recognize if es such. Let the
Indien keep his encient rites
and dances that { may know
the Way of his Barth and his
Sky here in this land thet once
was his. And let me send my
own fibers deep into my own
Rece-—soil that |, too, mey
know whence § came and
where | am going.

The civilized white man with
his “Education”, his automo-
bile, and his radio! Emptiness!
Life gone from his breast, his
belly, and his loins! Only a top-
heavy Head, an Intellect cram-
med with selfconsciousness and
the necessity getting of money!

There is no use “reviving” any

element of race culture and
tradition. People's spirits can be
set going. Souls can be brought
to birth; we can revive ourselves
and remember things that now
run dimly in our blood. There is
no Culture unless it be some
thing alive in you, unless in the
midst of your very bowels you
need it. “It is not these forms
that give the life, it is you who
give the life.”

So be it with the Culture
that belongs to us, who spesk
English, and who can feel
running in our blood things
that we weaken to os kindred:
Wednesday, Woden’s Day,
Weten, Odin, Al-tether; the
fer hening of «@ meuntein
song: @ play built frem whet
we, tee, have felt end wanted
te hear and see; the tilt end
fun ef music ond feet in ea
clrele ef clesped hends—ene
ect uniting individuels inte o
Whele—as the fiddte sings eut
and the dence begins; the full
swell of an orchestra beering
on its waves thet seng you
heard when yeu were a child.

It was these things with
which, early and late, I found a
deep kinship. I shall call them
the basis of “my” culture, I, an
“American”, whose blood-back-
will, “Nordic”: the old Runic
fragments called The Eddas
(newly translated by some lone
scholar in Texas), Appalachian
Songs’ and Ballads (some thous-
and collected, music and all, by
a certain. Englishman).

We are still young and un-
formed. We are still, really,
strangers and in a strange land.
We who speak English here jn
America can draw on ancient
sources as we seek to under-
stand our Selves.—All artists,
creators “to come’—they will
continually seek a deeper know-
ledge of our folklore tradition
with a reverence for the past.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Chumbley and Trotter:

Dear Editor:

It is annoying to constantly
view a misrepresentation. At
first, a simple mistake can be
corrected, but the administra-
tion has constantly refused to
recognize the true financial
state of the Vagabonds, and 60,
as a last resort, we feel it neces-
sary to present the truth.

In last Friday's DAVIDSON-
IAN, President Martin announc-
ed magnanimously that, al-
though the Vagabonds had
“overrun their budget” . . . “‘ad-
ditional funds were being made
available.” The first part of this
statement is absolutely false.

The approved Vagabond bud-
get for the year 1962-1963 was
$4,650 dollars, $1164 of which
was to be supplied from ticket
sales. Thus the college was to
supply $3,484. Actually, to date,
over fourteen hundred dollars
has been received from ticket
sales. NONE OF WHICH HAS
BEEN CREDITED TO THE
VAGABONDS' ACCOUNT. This
error has been called to the at-
tention of the administration not
once, but several times, with
no results...

We are constantly told that
the budget is $3484 and that
that figure has been overrun
through what is implied to be
incompetent management. As
a matter of fact, the adminis-
tration once acknowledged
that there was a “misunder-
standing” on their part—this
makes President Martin's

statement doubly inexplice-
ble. In truth, we are at pres-
ent over $1,400 ahead of our
budget and we have receipts
and necessary documents to

prove it and would be happy
to present them for public
examination.

The Administration’s attitude
becomes even more mysterious
when other facts are examined.
The Vagabonds, far from. dip:
ping into the bulging college
coffers, have actually saved the
college considerable expense in
various ways this season. Fore-
most is the lamentable fact that
the director was not paid a
single penny for his Herculean
labors—most liberal arts col-
leges at least put forth some
compensation . . . In addition,
despite repeated pleas and cries
for help, the director and the
students involved have furnish-
ed ALL of the transportation
needed for the productions—in
many instances, notably WIN-
TERSET, this ran into an un-
comfortable sum.

As a further illustration, we
asked the Administration re
cently why it was not possible
for the organization—an organ-
ization featured proudly in Dav-
ddson's public advertisements
(See last month's, PRESBYTER-
IAN SURVEY for a really un-
believable gem of this nature!)
—to have it's own typewriter.
(Until now we have been using
Dr. Goodykoontz's.) The answer
given? We were told, verbatim:,
“Well, if you wait until next
year, chances are you can get a
much better machine.”

Indeed?

The crux of the matter Is that
the Vagabond crisis has reéveal-
ed to us more than anything
else the astounding depth and

degree of seriousness of the sit-
uation and attitude at Davidson.
Using this crisis as a pivotal
point, we have made a search
into the recent history of the
college, and have come to one
unshakeable conclusion: The
time has come, if indeed it is
not long overdue, for a dedicat-
ed, courageous and perhaps
painful examination of the et-
titude of this college, and the
reasons for its very existence.
There is a crying need for an
exposure of the incredible dis-
parity between the actuality of
campus life and the public
image which the Administration
has tried so desperately to build.
If such an examination is not
made soon, the college is des-
tined to follow its present
course—and wil] ultimately sink
into a mire of hypocrisy, double-
think, and ineffectual, antiquat-
ed religion-mongering.

Finally, if the rhetoric of this
article is not to your taste,
there has been collected and
made available in the Fine Arts
building, several fat files, bulg-
ing with amazing evidence to
support our conclusion. At pres-
ent, THERE IS A DISPLAY OF
MANY OF THE CHOICEST
ITEMS (but by no means all)
FROM THIS UNIQUE COLLEC-
TION, SET UP IN THE STOWE
GALLERY CLASSROOM. We
invite your inspection of this
exhibit—it may reveai 10 you
a new aspect of Davidson and
it’s laughable excuse for a liber-
al arts curriculum.

College Pin-Up Stock Vanishes
As Reality Arrives For The Frolics

BY DAVE PUSEY

Davidsonian Feature Writer

I quote the questionnaire (see
page 3) distributed in, chapel a
few days ago: “In answering
these questions, please maintain
the propriety befitting yous Dav-
idson College gentiemanlin>
Avoid overt refercnces to sex—
be subtle if you must mention it:
Discretion is the keyword here.”

Well. of course the pollers
(namely we, the staff) would
have had a better time compil-
ing the gory results if the above
stipulation had not been firmly
stated. (By George, it wan't
too bad as it was!)

But in this instance the Fabu-
lous Friday Fries ed-tion of
Davidson's own Frolicsome jour-
nal had to follow accepted cus-
toms. And that custom, as stated
in the April 20 Apocrypha. read-
thusly: “And lo, th’re snreid
throughout the land glad tidings
of a dance weekend. And all the
shepherds of knowledge rose up.
shaved, tucked in their robes,
polished their camels, and other-
wise readied themselves. For
during the week, I thought as a
child, but this weekend I must
put away overt references.”

And, dear and sweet ladies,
whe by the time our paper
comes to light will be every-
where, brightening every cor-
ner of the compus, don’t you
think for an instent thet yeur
Tom, Dick, or Irving doesn’t
tive by the letter of this lew.
Fer ently hours befere you
come here, hundreds ef seme
of the werld’s leveliest women
kissed thelr mesters—your
datec—-goedby and slipped
away for a few deys’ vacation.

These women, while possese-
ing great beauty, are not noted
for their conversational knack,
but then there are times when
a man just likes to sit and think,
and sit... and think... and
... But don't worry, they're re-
linquishing this weekend to you
out-of-ttowners, and wish you a
good time to boot.

Now of course, you all are
grown girls and are able to face
facts, so you're probably al-

ready well aware of your dates’
extracurricular lovers. And may-
be you thought you'd get to see
them. this weekénd. But we men
can't let that happen.

You see. we like to dress up
on this special weekend, and
theze ladies just don’t have a
thing to wear. And, let's be hon-
est, they are suggestive of sex,
and I mean overtly suggestive.
And then these chicks just are-
n't up to a dance weekend, with
all its go-go-go. They just scem
to spraw] around on sofas, and
bearskin rugs. and things—not
a whole lot of ambition.

So away they go, into sun-
dry obscure hiding places.
But if you're insistent, and
will be tormented untess you
meet them, | would suggest
you search cerefully around
your room. So jog en up there
to fourth floor of Belk, at the
fer end of the wing. (Hehi You
*hink 19's bad now, try making
it up there at 5:00 this morn-
inet) And 1 will lead you
through the room in a diligent
examination.

It must be a pleasant surprise
to go into your date’s room, for
all those evi] things which you
were dreading just eren’t there.
But this is because he belongs to
the Mr. Clean Club, a campus or-
ganization that gives fresh
flowers every week to each room

Mecklenburg County. Rest Home
(though you might want to go
there Monday); rether, you are
welcomed to the Belk Hilton.
Now, quick: head for his desk
and check the drawer. So it's a
little crowded. Don’t give up
easily. (Bypass feminine hand-
writing. If it’s not from you or
his mother, it’s his YMCA pen-
pal in the Ukraine.) The comic
books you see are for breaks in
the study doldrums, the Mid-
night books are for his sociology
course, and the Trojans have

something to do with Medical
Greek. The women aren’t in
there? Well, on to the closet.

Why not put on a couple of
records on the stereo while you
look around—don't worry about
messing up his classification
system. He’s learned to expect
to find his Jimmy Reed albums
under “Symphonies” and his
Woody Woodburys under the
bed (or gone altogether.)

They're not in the closet
either, I'll bet. Just a couple of
dirty sweatshirts, some “vesper”
ties (No, I wouldn’t say they
were particularly sacriligious.),
and a pair of clod-hoppers, more

affectionately known as ROTC
shoes.

But you're getting warmer.
Next come the clothes draw-
ers, and you'll probably find
the lesses in them. Yes, it
might be testy, but try to over-
look what in the female jer-
gon are mentioned as unmen-
tionables. (If they have holes
in them, sew them up. He'll
wonder about it for weeks.)
Oops, you're getting closer.
There's a glint of slick paper!
Quick, is that them? Yes!
You've found them.

Now introduce yourself and
don't look et me in that tone of
voice. I ovently told you eartier
that they didn't have a thing to
wear! Judge not lest you be...
end so forth. Just brace your

> self, drink some water with your

size A cup that the janitors have
provided, wash your hands of
the affair with the similarly pro-
vided soep, and enjoy yourself
this weekend. But please, try
not to be overt. You might shock
Irving.

Chorus Shows Outsiders
Different Side Of Davidson

BY RICK VON UNWERTH
Davidsonian Assistant Editor

Davidson College offers her students much to be
proud of outside the academic realm; a traditionally good
name, a winning basketball team, and robably more
madras per capita than any other church-affiliated col-
lege for one thousand men in the country. 7

‘ Davidson College also has a Male Chorus, in addition
to or in spite of everything else. The Male Chorus is
recognized as one of the best of its kind; recognized and
appreciated perhaps by everyone but Davidson students.

After a concert in recent years, a reviewer for
the Charlotte News called the group “One of the
best choruses we have heard, and tops in our pres-
ent tally of male choruses in intonation.”

The Chorus is certainly as good now, if not better.
Professor Donald Plott, director of the Male Chorus,
believes that “you will have to look far to find one on
college levels that goes beyond” the Davidson Chorus.
Plott feels that at Davidson there is an “unusually good
opportunity to develop and maintain a chorus that can
sing the best in male chorus literature.”

In 1954, three years after Plott came to Davidson,
the Male Chorus produced a recording; an LP of sacred
and traditional music. The album didn’t sell, and the
college has yet to break even on the project. Part of the
problem then was the cost. The records sold for $4.95,
a deterrent to many of the Chorus’ student supporters.

Optional vesper services and forma! concerts
are free of charge to Davidson students, Financial
restrictions present no obstacle for the student in the
enjoyment and appreciation of good serious music,
live. It must be something else.

The Male Chorus has established its reputation on its
ability to do good music and do it well. An earlier edition
of the chorus moved a Charlotte Observer reviewer to
attribute to them “a timbre and finesse that must be the
envy of many larger colleges and universities. There is no
better example of good quality in relation to small quan-
tity.” That seems like good advertising.

Shortly before the Spring Holidays, the 1963 Male
Chorus completed the annual spring tour. They perform-
ed before a total audience of nearly 4500 persons at two
colleges, three churches, and three high school auditor-
iums. The tour was the culmination of the year’s work;
it provided the chorus with the opportunity to present
the college and its musical program to people in areas
where Davidson is not well known as well as those areas
where a reputation preceded them.

Last Sunday night the Male Chorus joined with
the Brass Ensemble and the Chapel Choir in present-
ing a Vesper program of Easter music. The perform-
ers lived up to their standard of excellence but the
sanctuary was far from full. Easter Sunday was a
poor night for dating; motivation was low this year.

Monday night the 29-man chorus will perform again
exclusively for Davidson in their Spring Concert. An un-
usual program will feature a group of German songs,
contemporary and folk songs, and some sacred music.
They will appear once more at the Trade Fair in Char- |
lotte’s Ovens Auditorium on May: third. In both perform-
ances they will reflect a higher side of Davidson College,
an area somewhat removed from the gin-and-madras
weekend Davidson.

Maybe it’s possible to play both ends.
