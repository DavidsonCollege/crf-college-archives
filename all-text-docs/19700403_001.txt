By NEIL COGHILL
Staff Writer

Julian Bond

spoke — this

annihila-
tion” and domestic geno
cide
The outspoken black

Georgia state legislator de-

livered a series of speeches
in the Martin Lecture Series
sponsored by Sigma Alpha
Epsilon social fraternity.

Bond said the war in Viet-
nam was a direct cause of
many of the nation’s social
and economic ills, and ad-
vised the nation to abandon
the ‘‘gunboat diplomacy of
the past.”

Bond called for a complete
“reconstruction” of the
American system, although
he, doubted that the necessary
radital changes would comé
in the next ten years, based
on experience of the past ten
years.

Bond recognized the pos-
sibility of violent revolution
but did not think it likely.
He did not believe that
Black Panthers could ever
overthrow the government,
but did fear an inseparable
split between the two races
if present conditions contin-
ued,

Bond characterized the last
ten years as having ‘‘demon-
strated time and time again
how the people of this na-
tion must take action” if
change is going to come.

In anticipating the next
ten years, he saw the only
hope as a coalition of groups
which would make up ‘a
noisy majority of people who
if they were acted together
could shake .. . the nation.”

Bond appeared confident
and cool and never raised
his voice while using the
invective of three black
leaders*of a century ago to
attack the deception, coward-

ice, and hypocrisy of white
America’s treatment of
blacks.

In the question and answer
period that followed his ad
dress and an open discussion
in the Morrison late
Tuesday night, Bond's sharp
humorous replies were
erally well received.

On the Black Panthers:
“There are two things —
first, they are a legitimate
political organization which
have not been successful be-
cause of constant harrass-

Room

gen-

ment by police; more impor-
fant, however, they have set
a new standard of manii-
ness in the black. commun-
ity.”

On busing: “Busing is an
old American practice

On whether he had any
faith in Nixon’s “‘secret sched-
ule” to withdraw troops from
Vietnam: “No.” On Judge
Harrold’ Carswell’s nomina-
tion to the Supreme Court:
“He has never distinguished
himself why should he
be?”

On Judge Julius Hoffman’‘s
handling of the trial of the
Chicago Seven: ‘The case
had no merits at all... he
(Hoffman) was «not at all
justified (in his procedure).”

By JOHN McLEAN
Managing Editor

The faculty, calling for a
more flexible method of eval-
uating students’ course work,
voted to do away with com-
pulsory .written final exam
inations at its Tuesday after
noon meeting.

A proposal from the Ed
ucational Policy Committee
was amended at the faculty
meeting last Tuesday to
read: “‘that an evaluation of
a student’s work at the end
of a course normally be
made by means-of a written
final examination of no more
than three hours in length.”

Faculty Puts Off
Open Dorm Vote

The faculty met in closed
session last Tuesday without
taking up the proposal, for
24-hour open dorms which
has been referred to it from
the Student Life Committee.

College President Samuel
R. Spencer Jr. said that the
faculty would probably meet
to consider the measure two
weeks from now. The faculty
will not meet next week be-
cause of the planned visit
by former Secretary of State

Dean Rusk on campus at
that time.
The proposal, which was

approved by the Residence
Hall Council. the SGA Sen-
ate and the SLC, changes the
RHC Manual of Order so
that a dotmitory could vote
to have cpen house 24-hours
a day if it so desired.

The SLC had approved the
mensure. but in doing so ac-
cepted Spencer's belief that
the SLC did not fave final
authority in the matter but
should. defer to the faculty
and the trustees.

Spencer had said that the
measure contradicted past
faculty-trustee policy, an’ in-
terpretation which has not
heen accepted by the RHC.
(See Mar. 6 issue of THE
DAVIDSONIAN, P. 1.)

Near complete returns
from the RHC referendum
on the open dorms proposal
show that 79.81 percent of
students voting favor unlimit-
ed hours. The RHC will use
the referendum vote- to de-

board of
