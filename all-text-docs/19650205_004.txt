Professor W. G. McGav-
ock’s recent attack on sub-
sidized athletics at David-
son would have received a
’more favorable reception at
many small Southern col-
leges.

Desubsidization at these
schools initially received a
cool response. But after
several seasons of adjustment
the “amateur” programs have
captured strong student and
alumni support, according to
DAVIDSONIAN correspondence.

As early as 1954, a joint
faculty-trustees committee. at
Davidson recommended that
the Trustees “authorize the
President of the College to
extend an invitation to a se-
lected group of Colleges and
Universities, asking them to
join with us in setting up a
Conference with a view of
abolishing subsidzed athletics
at the earliest possible date.”

No action was ever taken
at Davidson, but. in January,
1962 such a conference was.
formed, the College Athletic
Conference (CAC), with Se-
wanee, Southwestern, Centre,
Washington and Lee, and
Washington University at St.
Louis as charter members.

Davidson is -ofien mentioned
as a potential member of the
CAC, and Waiter Bryant, Se-
wanee director of athletics,
stated in a recent letter to
THE DAVIDSONIAN, “I can

had rather have as our sixth
member than your fine insti-
tution.”

After participating in some-
thing of a “big-timé’ program,
all CAC members desubsidized
athletics before coming together
as a confefence. Sewanee, be-
fore desubsidizing in 1938,
had become the “doormat of
the Southeastern Conference,
and what might be described
as a joke in athletics circles.’
according to Bryant. Conse-
quently, he continued, ‘It is
simply a matter of necessity
with us. If we gave athletic
scholarships, almost all the
teams that we are now compet-
ing against would drop us.”

Washington and Lee had sim-
ilar experiences before desub-
sidizing in 1954. Being forced
to compete with such teams as
Tennessee, Maryland, Navy, and
Alabama, Washington and Lee
was forced to offer schoiar-
ships to scholastically inferior
athletics, a practice incom-
patible with the basic goals of
the school.

Other CAC members have al-
so long been proponents of
nonsubsidized athletics: South-
western gave up athletic scho-
larships in 1942, and Centre
and Washington of St. Louis
in 1946.

Alumni and student response
these schools’ actions has been
fairly good. According to one
Davidson official, “It is my
feelng. .. .that the alumni (at]
these schools) are relatively |
happy with the present situa-
tion.”

Although there were pro-
tests from some quarters at
first, most groups now accept
the situation as best for their!
particular institution. Reports

| Bryant, “Our student body tak-

es just as much pride and is
just as concerned with the Suc-
cess or failure of our athletic
teams as do the students of
of the so-caHed big league
schools.”

Members of the CAC play
only other schools having non-
subsidized athletic programs,
and schools have not lost the
pride in winning merely be-

cause they no longer play big-
time athletics. According
Bryant, ‘“Desubsdidization seems

undefeated football teams; in
1960 Washington and Lee was
undefeated in football.

Scholarships at these schools
are administered to all students
on need, as are academic scho-
larships at Davidson. Although
the coaches can recommend
athletes for scholarships all.
financial aid is handled through
a faculty committee. No stu-
dent is obligated to continue
participating in a sport to re-
new his scholarship.

Several other non-member
schools who schedule CAC
teams administer athletic scho-
larships on a limited basis. At
Hampden-Sydney 35 to 40 foot-
ball and basketball players are
granted. an average of less
than $400 annually. Randolph-
Macon also gives limited a-
mounts to participants in three
sports. Both of these schools
have declined membership in
the CAC because of the pro-
hibitive cost of travel for the
so-called “minor sports.”

Washington Semester

Juniors Decker Faw and
Steve Graham, are partici-
pating in the Washington
Semester program this se-
mester..

Davidson is one of more than
fifty selected colleges which
has been invited by American
University in Washington, D.C.,
to participate in a program
whereby undergraduate stu-
dents have first hand contact
with the national capital per-
sonalities, institutions, and
source materials.

Film Friends Reveal
Semester Program

The Film Friends of David-
son College will open this
semester's program ‘with a
showing of Birth of a Nation,
directed by D. W. Griffith, on
Feb. 22 and 23.

Last semester the commit-
tee tried to present a reper-
toire of films which would
give the community an intro-
duction to so-called’ ‘‘art
films.” With this background,
there will be presented this
semester a specific theme—
“Great Directors.” It seems
apropos to begin with one of
the greatest American -direc-
tors, D. W. Griffith. The film,
made in 1915, is generally an
account of the formative years
of the United States. It lays
particular emphasis on
Civil War and Reconstruction

tO] days. It has, incidentally. been

considered a_ glorification of

can be picked up at the first
showing. Some of the classics
to be offered are Rene Claire's
A Nous, La Liberte, a brilliant
satire on the effect of mechan-
anization on human _ beings,
and Einstenstein’s Alexander

film has been widely acclaim-
ed as one Of the = a)’-time
classics.

The past semester has beer
fairly successful. The re. ponsc
of the faculty and student |
body has been good. Due to
the high cost of the fim.
it was impossible to break
even, but the deficit was
more than compensated for by,
the Morrison Room showings.

The purpose of the Film
Friends is to present movies
that have standing in the
realm of art and that have
significant content. Because
of the definite theme this
semester, they plan to have
organized discussion after each
showing along with refresh-
ments. There will be a de-
signated discussion leader.

Gordon Ball, chairman of
the committee, feels that these
movies should be a_ learning
process. He said, ‘Film Friends
springs from the hope that
in a limited way the generally
shallow intellectual depth of
Davidson may be deepened}
somewhat by exposure to new

ways of life and thought.”

Under this program Davidson
can send three students per
semester to the School of
Social Sciences and Public Af-
fairs of the American Univer-

sity. receiving credit toward
their degrees from Davidson.
The principal course is a semi-
nar in which the student meets
with officials at the White
House, the Congress, the
Supreme Court, and other gov-
ernmental and non-governmental
agencies and, based on sub-
sequent study and personal
contact while in Washington.
prepares a thesis on some sub-
ject which combines his major
field of study at Davidson with
some aspect of the national
government or politics. In addi-
tion to this seminar, the stu-
dent generally also chooses
nine hours of regular course
work at the American Univer-

sity.

Under a cooperative agree-
ment, tuition is paid in the
regular manner to Davidson
while charges for board and
room at the American Univer-
sity are paid in Washington.
Student participants defray
their own costs for travel and
other expenses. While designed
especially for social science
majors and generally taken in
the second semester of the
junior year, the program is
open to students regardless of
their major field, provided
thelr academic work has been
of a sufficiently high quality.
