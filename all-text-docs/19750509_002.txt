“The new arrangement is
necessary to ensure that the
Trustees’ bylaws are suf-
ficient in the eyes of the Court,”
said Spencer.

The Trustees also approved
promotions for several David-
son faculty members.

Louise Nelson was advanced
from Associate to Full
Professor of Economics.

Promoted from Assistant to
Associate Professorships were
Charles Cornwell in English,
Hans Epes in German, Dirk
French in Classics, and Robert

Manning in Physics.

Moving from Instructor to
Assistant Professor were John
Kello in Psychology, Norman
Koller in Sociology, Lauren
Yoder in French, and Georgian-
na Ziegler in English.

Several professional sab-
baticals were also granted by
the Trustees.

Professor of English Richard
Cole and Associate Professor of
Physics Robert Manning were
granted one year sabbaticals.

A two-term sabbatical was
extended to Assistant Professor
of Art W. Herbert Jackson,

to insure that the Trustees’ bylaws are
sufficient in the eyes of the Court.”

President Samuel R. Spencer Jr.

Center for Honors Studies Earl
MacCormac and Professor of

W. Brown Patterson,
Associate Professor of History,
was given a leave of absence to
conduct research on King
James 1 or england.

Title changes of two college
administrators were also ap-

proved by the Trustees.

H. Edmunds White's title was
adjusted from Director to Dean
of Admissions and Financial
Aid.

Grover Meetze Jr.'s title was
expanded from Director of the
Physical Plant to Director of
the Physical Plant and
Facilities Planning.

point where he has been
working for free.

Other Senators proposed that
Swalwell’s wages be increased
past $1.60 an hour. SGA
President John Munce stated
the point was well taken but for
reasons of time it should be
delayed till the fall.

The $200 for the ad-
ministrative assistant is for
both training for Sewell

and an assistant

’ for Sewell to cut down on his

workead. The assistant would
only be for the first half of next
year.

’ ‘The referendum tabled last
week on the Quips '’n Cranks
was defeated 8-10-0. The
referendum would be to
discover whether the students
desire a change in the basic for-
mat of the Quips an Cranks.

Objections to the referendum
being next week were primarily
centered on the amount of
people who would either be
voting and not seen a Quips ’n
Cranks or who would not be ef-
fected by the decision.

Munce concluded the senate
meeting stating that,“‘a number
of powerful things are in the
works.”’ He went on to mention
the frustration of trying to get
something done as a student.

“If a student is not at the door
nine times out of ten a
students opinion won’t be
sought out.’’ said Munce.

A particular difficulty the
Senate has faced is being
unable to sort out where they
want to go, and what they want
to do.

“Some have said we might
need an issue such as co-

education a few years ago, but
we have done an adequate and
respectible job,’’Munce
stressed.

Munce concluded by stating
that students face a problem in
that they are only here for four
years, while the faculty or staff
is here for life, which often
results in them ignoring the
students.

Therefore continual vigilance
is necessary to kieep groups
from becoming rubber stamp
groups.

In other actions the Senate
appointed Don Munford to the
Alumni Activities commitee,
Dee Booth to the Athletics Com-
mittee, and refected Tonv
Snow’s bid for power and placed
Bill Bond on the Religous Policy
Committee.

Snow’s only comment was, “‘I
knew I had lost when he said Dr.
Rhodes wasn’t on the com-
mittee, and that he was a
religion major. -

Reports were heard from
various councils and -com-
mitteess, Rick Roylances Union
Report attracted the most at-
tention in the area of whether of
not there will be a Post Office in
the Union next year.

$90 was reserved for the NSA
congress in Washington this
summer, and an amendment
was passed giving off campus
residents representation in the
Resident Housing Council.

Senators Clark, Ionas . and
Garrou were absent. It was
Clarks fourth meeting, Ionas
missed his third and it was the
first Garrou missed.

Shuffled authority delays fire plans

By MATTHEW COVINGTON
News Editer
Progress is being made
toward the posting of fire
escape routes in the dor-
matories and a permanent
settlement will be decided on
for the °75-"76 school year, ac-
cording to Business Manager

Robert A. Currie.

One of the first moves toward
the of fire routes in
the dorms was the distribution

ot eee ee
routes to Director of Housing
Seotty Nicholls. These routes
were sent to Nicholis and left in
her office by the Physical Plant
Office which had held stencils
for duplicating the fire escape
plans since 1969.
Director of the Physical Plant
Grover C. Meetze, declined to
comment in any way about his
office’s part in duplicating of
sending the fire routes to Mrs.

Nicholls. Meetze indicated that
any information about the fire
routes should be gotten from
Nicholls.

“She has them (fire routes)
now. She is who you (this repor-
ter) should see,”’ said Meetze.

Nicholls was unavailable for
comment, having been ex-
pressly asked by her boss to ad-
dress herself only to issues
directly related to housing.

Currie, who requested this of
Nicholls, suggested that fire
diagrams were the respon-
sibility of the Physical Plant.

“I believe the fire diagrams
came out. of the Physical Plant
Office,” said Currie.

When it was suggested to
Currie that the distribution of

the fire routes to Nicholls, who
is without a staff to re-
distribute them to students, was
an effort on the part of the
Physical Plant to relieve itself
of responsibility, he agreed that
this was possible.

“There may have been an
element of that. I don’t deny
it,’ said Currie.

Meetze, when asked if his of-
fice had tried to relieve itself of
responsibility, refused to com-
ment directly.

“You will have to talk to Mrs.
Nicholls, that is all Iam saying.
She is the one who made the
complaint and started all of
this, ’’ said Meetze.

Currie explained that the en-
tire situation between the dif-
ferent offices involved is in a
State of change.

“We are trying to define
organizational responsibility
and to affirm reporting lines
Mrs. Nicholls used to report to

‘a | the Dean of Students, now she

Currie

reports to me, ’’ said Currie.

Currie also indicated that
work was being done as far as
deciding how the fire routes will
be displayed, where they will be
displayed and what size they
would be. He is looking in com-
mercial institutions to see how
they are displaying fire routes
and intends to have a decision
made by next year.

Currie expressed an opinion
that ‘little could be done this
year to distribute the fire routes

. Which now sit in Nicholls’ office.
