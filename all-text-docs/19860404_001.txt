Warnke’s speech highlights Nuclear Awareness Week

By ANDREA GROSS

Paul Warnke, former Director
of the U.S. Arms Control and Dis-
armament Agency, gave a keyn-
ote address on “The Nuclear Arms
Picture” Wednesday night as part
of Nuclear Awareness Week. The
week, which was sponsored by
the YSSC Nuclear Forum and the
Dean Rusk Program, also featured
Reagan administration spokes-
man Robert Simmons and Retired
Navy Commander William With-
row, speaking on various aspects
of arms control and disarmament.

Before an audience of 300,
Warnke criticized __—~ President
Reagan’s proposed Strategic De-
fense Initiative, calling it “an arti-
cle of faith,” which “has nothing
to do with logic.” He said: “The
problem with SDI is that it has to
work perfectly the first time. And
we know that nothing works per-

fectly, not even a Volkswagen.”

Warnke said he approved of
the U.S. intentions at the recent
November summit: “The lyrics
were indistinct, but at least the
mood music was good.” How-
ever, he said that Reagan’s actions
“since that time have been disap-
pointing.”

Concerning the Soviet
Union’s January proposal to elim-
inate all nuclear arms from the
planet by the year 2000, Warnke
said he “found some seeds of
hope” in the plan. He said that
total elimination of all arms “can’t
be done.”” However, he added, “If
it’s a bluff, let’s call the bluff.”

Yesterday, Mr. Robert Sim-
mons of the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency outlined the
progress of the current Geneva
arms control negotiations. Sim-
mons, who is Deputy Director of

the Theater Affairs Division of the
Strategic Programs Bureau in the
agency, said that the negotiations
are divided into three areas: the
Strategic Arms Reductions Talks
(START), the Intermediate Range
Nuclear Force Talks (INF), and
the space weapons talks.

Simmons said the negotiations
are taking place under “two con-
texts,’”” — summits and SALT II.
The summit context includes the
series of planned Reagan-Gor-
bachev meetings, around which
the arms negotiations revolve.
The first of these meetings took
place in Geneva in November.
Commenting on the future of sum-
mitry, Simmons said: “I don’t
think that you'll see Gorbachev
coming in May, but I think that he
will come some time this year.”

The SALT II context involves

the SALT II treaty, to which both
the U.S. and Soviet Union have
claimed to adhere, though the tre-
aty was never actually ratified.
This treaty would have expired in
Dec. 1985.

Simmons said that Reagan and
Gorbachev agreed to two “high
priorities” in the negotiations.
These include a fifty percent re-
duction of strategic offensive sys-
tems and an “interim INF agree-
ment.” Yet he noted that problems
of “effective verification,” “‘lin-
kage,” “transfer of technology,”
and Gorbachev's “apparent lack
of seriousness” have impeded a
final settlement in the negotia-
tions.

Retired Navy Commander
William Withrow also spoke to
Davidson students and faculty
yesterday about the necessity of

nuclear arms‘ control. Withrow
said that the present combined
tonnage of TNT in the U.S. and
Soviet nuclear arsenals is 6,000
times that of the bombs used in all
of World War II. Withrow added
that if the U.S. continues to build
its his nuclear arsenal at current
rates, the costs of the arms buildup
will eventually wreck the U.S.
economy.

“Nuclear Awareness Week”
also featured films on the arms
race and talks by Davidson facul-
ty. On Tuesday, /f You Love this
Planet and Countdown for Ameri-
ca, two films reflecting opposite
views of the nuclear arms race,
were shown. On Wednesday,
Religion Professor David Kaylor
and Physics Professor Allen Wolf
spoke on “The Theology and
Technology of S.D.1."

Potok discusses polarization of individual, society

By HEIDI HOOKER

Pulitzer Prize winner Chiam
Potok spoke as the Reynold’s Lec-
turer Wednesday, March 26 in
Love Auditorium on “Authority
and Rebellion: The Individual in
Modern Literature” and gave a
reading of his works correspond-
ing to that lecture Thursday,
March 27 in Chamber’s Gallery.

Potok is respected as an author
of a series of five best-selling
novels: The Chosen, The Prom-
ise, In the Beginning, My Name is
Aher Lev, and Wanderings. His
most recent work was The Book of
Lights. Potok is active in conser-
vative Judaism.

Potok lectured on his theories
concerning the polarization of the
individual and society as tevealed
in modern literature in terms of
various types of value confronta-
tions. He discussed the formation
of cultures based on the command
attempt to answer “four o’clock in
the a.m. questions.”

Potok explained that the re-
sponses and values that become
intrinsic to a culture make it logi-
cally open to confrontations of
different kinds. Potok discussed

literature including his own
novels as a portrayal of individu-
als against different backdrops of
culture.

The four different cultural
value confrontations he presented
were core to core, core to
periphery, periphery to a clash be-
tween the core values of two or
more cultures. The core to
periphery confrontation involves
an absorption of value within a
culture periphery by the core
value system of a society. While
there is no alteration of the core
culture in this case, in periphery to
core confrontatios, the culture’s
periphery is changed significantly
by the culture’s core. The
periphery to periphery confronta-
tion yields great cultural altera-
tions.

Potok described that when
cultures fuse in these confronta-
tions and change each other, both
sides become richer. However, he
explained that man is terrified of
ideas outside of his cultural sys-
tems because he often does not
have enough strength to deal with
these ideas that threaten his cur-

rent understanding. Strength of

intellectual confrontation may be
derived from education, accord-
ing to Potok.

In terms of culture in Ameri-
ca, Potok remarked that colleges
and universities play the role of
“power plants of Western cul-
ture.” He explained that Ameri-
ca’s civilization is still in cultural
formation, developing around a
growing core of values.

In terms of his own writing,
Potok commented that as an au-
thor he “creates worlds out of
words on paper.” He linked his
abilities to his Jewish back-
ground, perceiving Judaism as a
word world and a text world.

Through the novel, he be-
lieves the author shapes a world of
ideas. He commented, ‘The au-
thor’s vision serves as eyeglasses
through which the readers see the
world.”

In his reading on Thursday,
Potok turned to his own novels as
models of confrontations in cul-
ture which he discussed Wednes-
day night. Potok’s stories center
around the problem of the “human
adventure:” how one holds onto
the values of his old world when

navigating through new worlds.
Potok discussed The Chosen
as a fundamental core to core con-
frontation. He interrupted
Danny's exposure to Freud and its
effects on Danny's faith, reveal-
