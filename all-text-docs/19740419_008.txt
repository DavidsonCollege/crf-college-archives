= Workshop Learners Innovate

By MATTHEW COVINGTON

The Davidson College
Drama Workshop, a
producing group for the
College’s Springtime play
series, is currently in the
midst of its second season of
producing five plays under the
tutelage of Professor of
Drama Rupert T. Barber.

The purpose ot the Urama
Workshop program is to give
students experience in all the
phases of dramatic produc-
tion, sometimes leading to
unexpected excitements.

‘People do things in
workshop that they never
thought they could do because
of the pressures involved in
getting all the odd jobs done.”

The Drama Workshop is
open to all interested stu-
dents and indeed, it is
the students that make the
productions go. A drama
workshop class is also offered

in the spring and the nomen-

clature is a source of con-
fusion.

The workshop program is a
producing group open to in-
terested students as an extra-
curricular. It is from this
program that the greater
mass of people involved in the

.. Springtime productions come.

The workshop class is a
theatre studio class and many
of its students are, because of
their interest, involved with
the workshop program. The
two are not the same

The Drama _ Workshop
program is the actual produc-
tion of the plays. ‘the “putting
them on’), while the class is
where the production is ac-
complished. Barber assures
that the names will be
changed next year.

The Drama Workshop oc-
curs in the spring because, ac-
cording to Barber: ‘‘Spring

seems to be more conducive to
experimentation. After winter
term people seem more ready
to try something different.
Generally, I think spring is
looked at as a time to ex-
periment.

“The program was started
last spring when drama in-
terest became so great that we
couldn't handle all the people
who wanted the experience,”’
he said. ‘I think in a liberal
arts college the drama ex-
perience should be made
available to as many people as
want it because of its
broadening nature through
the study of character.

“By the end of this week
there will have been seven
student-directed plays using
at least 45 different people on
stage. There are probably that
many more people involved in
the work off-stage.

Since the very purpose of
having the series in the spring
is to encourage the ex-
perimentation which is basic
to the program. this vear has
already been and continues to
be. highly successful Out-

novations and eX-
perimentations Is ae

said Barber
‘This \ear we are con
tinuing that kind of thing with
“Dracula” where we hope to
work out an environmental
theatre where the ac-
tor audience relationship is
all the same ©
Another innovation for this
year is the kind and scope of
the plays being produced. Last
spring saw only contemporary
American productions, with
an accent on what was suc-
cessful on Broadway. This
year has already seen Wilmer
Welsh's midieval passion play

so that I could learn

as: well as the institution of en-
vironmental theatre with
‘‘Dracula’’. The experience of
the performers as well as the
audience is expanded by this
kind of innovation, according
to Barber.

generally inexperienced. This
isn't to say that they are not
benefiting from the class. It
does point up, however, the
importance of the Drama
Workshop for it is here that
the student directors receives
their most beneficial direc-
tion. They learn by doing.

Davidson students. These
plays come to Barber during
the year and he passes them
on to student directors so that
they can decide which ones
they want to produce.

The opportunity for an all-
Davidson play is exciting and
Barber believes that as the
program catches on, there
may have to be a play contest
to decide what plays will be
considered.

The Red Bandanas
Graduation Sale

The ‘‘Red Bandanas”’ is a small landscaping company
operating in the Davidson area. I started this company
during the winter of my sophomore year, and during the
spring we worked entirely on yard maintenance.

That summer I decided to work for a local nurseryman

which

landscaping, requires more
skill and produces higher profits (from retailing plants).
The next winter I streamlined my organization, bought
more equipment, and worked all spring with two em-

ployees. During the summer I located enough jobs to keep
three employees and myself working hard all fall. I was
successful and this year my volume and earnings were up

five times over last year.

Currently, my business picture looks great; my income
to date is two and a half times greater than last year's at
the same time, and the reputation of the ‘‘Red Bandanas”
as a friendly, fast-moving, thoroughly competitive and
competent landscaping service is growing.

I am graduating this spring and I am interested in
selling the business to someone who wants to learn some
of the practical aspects of running a business. When |
began, I had no idea of the challenges or rewards that

business could offer.

I am asking a very reasonable price for this business
since I would like to see it continue to be run by a Davidson
student. If you're interested, please contact me evenings
at 892-0617 or drop a card to Box 1325.

Thank you very much.

Sincerely,
‘Mark C.'Leonard

mented Barber

No “D.C. original” has, as
yet. ever been produced in any
form outside of the invidious
Davidson community and ac-
cording to Barber the plays as
written are generally in-
dicative ‘‘first plays’’. He
suggested that the author
probably learns a lot by seeing
his work produced.

“The workshop program
couldn't work without stu-
dents putting in hours of work.
The scale is small. Our
costumes come from
wardrobe. Our philosophy is to
make do artistically with what
we have. This stretches the
imagination of the student,”
said Barber.

Barber adds, ‘‘Producing is
harder than directing and I
really have to run around. It's
great though and the students
rally seem to be excited about
it. [knowl am.”

In general, whether the play
is student written or selected
from successful plays outside
the school, after the student-
director decides on the play
and how he wants to play it,
rehersals begin. These are,
because of the short allotment
of time, intense rehersals.
