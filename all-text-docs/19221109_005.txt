~ VOLUNTEER BAND IS
ADDRESSED BY HUDGINS

Perrin Hudgins spoke on the sub-
ject of “Spiritual Cripples” at the
regular meeting of the Volunteer Band
Sugslay. He said most every one car-
ries crutches to support their spiritual
failings. “One of our crutches is our
doit. What everybody else does
because “Tom, Dick and Harry’ do it;
continuing in the general drift, regard-
less of whether it is right or not.” He
said such little thing as overeating may
place a barrier between man and
Christ. If those little sins are not
worth giving up now, they are not
worth giving up at all. A little delay
may cost eternity. The surrender of
life to Christ is the least we can do, and
with the exercise of faith in Christ’s
power, a more perfect life will be at-
tained.

“Everything is to be gained and
nothing to be lost in being a Christian,”
said Hudgins, quoting Billy Sunday.

Perrin Hudgins and Ted Jones, with
the quartet, were sent on a deputation

‘to thé Second Presbyterian Church of
Charlotte on October 26. Hudgins re-
ported that they spoke and sang at the
Sunday school service, also in the
intermediate department, then at a
Mission Sunday school in the after-
noon. Hudgins spoke on “The World
to Be Evangelized: Crossing the
Ocean, Street, and Heart,” and Jones
talked on “Consecration: Why, When,
Where.”

It was voted to unite the Volunteer
and Ministerial Bands in a union meet-
ing Sunday morning at 10 o’clock. It
was suggested that the Volunteers and
Ministerial candidate alternate in
conducting the meetings. The Minis-
terial Band has not yet voted on this
matter. }

Mid-week prayer meeting for Vol-
unteers was definitely decided to’ be
-held in the Phi hall every lec!
evening at 7 o week

WORK ON CHURCH ANNEX
PROGRESSING RAPIDLY

After long delays in the delivery of
material, due to the railroad strike,
work has been resumed on the annex
to the Presbyterian Church, and rapid
progress is being made toward its com-
pletion. The addition to the church
should be ready for use within a few
weeks,

The annex, which is to be two
stories high, is on the eastern end of
the present auditorium. It will be a
valuable addition to the, church. The
ground floor, which will be 30 feet by

45 feet, will be used especially by the
Sunday School Department, and will
also be the place for church socials.

The second story, which will be a
part of the main auditorium, will con-
tain 150 seats, and in this way will
greatly relieve the crowded condition
now existing in the church.

SOPHOMORE CLASS TEAM

TAKES ON CONCORD “Y”

Last Wednesday night eleven husky
basketball stars from the Sophomore
class hurried through their supper,
piled into two Ford cars waiting in
front of White’s, and sped through the
country to Concord, where they were

scheduled to meet the fast “Y” team
of that city. The stellar quality of the
visiting team had been well advertised,
and a good crowd was on ne to see
the game. The Concord “Y” was rep-
resented by a real Basleethall team, and
there wasn't anything easy in store for
the Wildkittens. “Rat” Long, a for-
mer N, C. State player and other for-
mer college stars were in the line-up,
The game began promptly at 8:30,
The first half was nip and tuck all the
way. Pete Mitchell started the scoring
by dropping in a field goal from the
middle of the floor, but Concord dup-
licated this feat a few seconds later.
Due to the small court, and several new
rules which were introduced by the
Concord referee, the Sophomores

made numerous fouls, and at the end.

of-the-first half the “Y° was leading,
13 to 10, Each team, however, regis-
tered four field) goals in the first
period, ‘

The next half saw the Sophomores
turn the tables completely. Showing
splendid team work, they completely
outclassed their larger and more ex-
perienced opponents. On the defen-
sive they were at their best, and al-
lowed the Coneord boys only one field
goal, while they themselves were col-
lecting five. The final score was 23-18.

There was no outstanding stars for
the Sophomores. The entire team
played well and no substitutions were
made, ‘Those making the trip were:
Staley, Mitchell, Anderson, Morrison,
Koenig, Boges, Ocland, Wharton,
Brice, Taylor, Price and Beall,

WEDNESDAY EVENING

The services opened on Wednesday
night with a well-arranged, appealing
address on what is considered hy many
to be the greatest verse in the entire
Bible—John, 3:16. ‘The exact mean-
ing of the word “believe” was ex-
plained, It means more than simply
not doubting the truth of thDible. If
we believe in Christ we will put our
trust in Him and will seek to do Tis
will.

THURSDAY EVENING

The text was Matt. 16:16, “And
Simon Peter answered and said, ‘Thou
art the Christ, the’ Son of the living
God.” Peter would never have fol-
lowed Christ unless his trust and con-
fidence had been won by the authority
expressed in Christ’s face and the per-
fection of his daily life. Christ, who
is able to save to the uttermost de-
mands that we follow Him and entirely
submit our will to His.

FRIDAY EVENING

What is a Christian? This question
was solved Friday night. A Christian
must have Christ at the very center of
his life. Christ must be Lord of all or
He is not Lord at all. T hat peace
which the world can.neither give nor
take away is found only in Christ. The
footpath to peace lies in the verse,
“Come unto me, all ye that labour and
are heavy laden, and I will give you
rest.’

A quartet, composed of Vic Brown,

Ted Jones, Buck Currie and Bob
MeLeod furnished special music.
Doctor mee took his text from
Acts 9:16, “Lord, what wilt Thou have
me to do?” the first words of the
Apostle Paul after his conversion.
“We are all face to face with the
same problem,” said the speaker, “the
problem of our lives. Man stands with
an immortal soul—the life of which
stretches into eternity. The question
before each of us is, ‘How can I maki
iny life count most for God and
humanity? Many. voung men drift
into life, drift through life, and drift
out of life, with no purpose in view,
and go leave the world no better for
their We lived in it. If we all
seriously face the problem of our life
work, there will be a different result.”
Doctor Lingle discussed the method
of selecting a life work, taking the
example of the Apostle Paul.
“First we must ask God's guidance,
and be willing to do, to go, and to be
as God wishes, always standing ready

to do Tis will, We must answer to
the call, as did the child) Samuel,
‘Speak, Lord, for ‘Thy — servant
heareth.’?

The speaker also called to mind

Isaiah, who, when he heard the call,
made the ready response, “Here am 1,
send me.”

“The real powers in the chureh are
those who are willing to be obscure, to
sacrifice themselves for others.

“Then we must take an inward look ;
Wwe must take an inventory of our lives,
and see in which direction our talents
lead us, and so invest our lives in the
field where they will be for most
uC vod.”

“Look outward ; behold the field, the
world, Consider thee needs of the
world. ‘Think iimperially, — Consider
the various callings of the world, the
needs, the possibilities, your talents for
those places, and ask God's leadership
in your choice.”

At this point the speaker put in. an
carnest: plea for men to stop and
seriously consider the ministry asa life
work.

“The needs for ministers of the
Gospel is great. There goes up a great
cry for more ministers. At present in
our own denomination in the south-
land, there is a great ery. ‘Two hun-
dred ministers are needed today,

“Take the manward look, — the
friendward look, God sometimes uses
man to make THis will known to other
men. In approaching your life work,
let Him have full control of your life.
Put on the altar your most precious
possession, your life.”

At the close of this stirring appeal,
Doctor Lingle asked of those present
the following questions: “Are you

willing to be what God would have you |

to be, to go where He would have to
go, and to do what He would have you
to do? Do you wish to rededicate your
life to His service? Do you wish to
make a profession of Christ for the
first time?”

After each question he asked those
willing to answer in the affirmative to
stand.

SUNDAY EVENING “Y”
SERVICE

The climax of the services was
reached at the regular Sunday “Y”
service. Doctor Lingle’s subject was
“Lord, What Wilt ‘Thou Have Me to
Do?” No man can definitely decide

this question for another, but definite
pi ‘inciples can be given to go by in
-ecking an answer to it. We should do
as Paul did when he faced this ques-
tion—look upward to God, look out-
ward to the need af the world, and
look friendward to others. The only
life vou have to live should not be per-
mitted to drift. In response to the
question, “Are you willing, in so far as
you can interpret God’s will, to be
what Gol wants you to be, to do what
God wants vou to do, and to go where
He wants you to go?” about 85 per
cent of the audience arose. About 60
per cent reconsecrated themselves to a
closer, more loyal life of service.
SUNDAY MORNING

A omasteriul address was given on
the subject, How-Can-1Grow in My
Christian Life?” Imitating Christ’s
life is a slow process. It is not instan-
taneous. ‘Three rules of growth were
given —taking the proper food for the
soul, living in-a wholesome environ-
ment and by exercise. A religion that
is Worth living is worth passing on to

MINISTERTAL. BAND

\fter congratulating the Ministerial
Band members for accepting such a
holy calling, Doctor Lingle stated that
if he had 10 lives to live he would live
them all in the ministry. Tle stated
that in order to be a successful minis-
ter, a preacher must never make a

the ball deep in the Freshmen’s terri-
tory in Oak Ridge’s possession. Sev-
eral drives by Sherrill and Hollings-
worth put the ball 6n Davidson's five-
yard line with four downs to carry it
over. Davidson held, however, and
the ball went over, Johson, standing
behind his own goal line, kicked 40
yards out of bounds. Davidson re-
covered the ball on a fumble, and made
several nice gains on passes. The half
ended with the ball in the middle of the
field in: Davidson’s possession.

The second half developed into a
kicking duel between Sherrill for the
visitors, and Williams for Davidson,
interspersed by several gains by Black
and MacDonald who seemed to be able
to gain at will. But fumbles proved
costly and Davidson lost the ball.

In the last period) Davidson ad-_
vanced the ball into Oak Ridge’s terri-
tory, but Johnson failed at goal. The
I*reshmen recovered a fumble in the
middle of the field, and soon had the
ball on Oak Ridge’s 10-yard line, but
the necessary punch was lacking, and
the ball went over. Instead of kicking
Oak Ridge attempted to pass which
Black intercepted and dashed 15 yards
for the Wildkittens second touchdown.
Johnson failed at goal.
