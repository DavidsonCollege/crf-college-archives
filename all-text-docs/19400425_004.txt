ROUGH WEEK...
Wildcat took it

the chin on all sides this week,
the

teams on

including previously un-
defeated tennis and track
teams. The Davidson netters
went down before the crack
Presbyterian College team,
winners of nineteen matches
in a row. The Wildcats were
sunable to win a set, showing

the one-sidedness of the match.

Coach Pete Whittle’s track-
sters were upset by the Wolf
pack from State in a very close
meet which was not decided
until the last event. Mickey
Thompson, State dash man,
won 15 paints: by copping the
100, 220, andthe broad jump.

EQUIPMENT NEEDED ...

This corner has been asked
for better intramural equip
ment. The question is to whom
should this plea for more and
better equipment be directed
In spite of this fact, that no
body in particular seems to

want to assume the responsi-
bility of providing aforesaid
equipment, we shall plead for
this worthy cause.

Taking as a specific example
the softball situation, we find

that it if not the case of lack
of space as in former years;
the new intramural field has

solved that problem. The balls
provided are not fit to be used
and the teams usually buy
their own. Masks are also non
existent unless some student
happens tq have one. Various
and sundry~ other—things—are
lacking which are practically
standard equipment.

a]

ut

The usual answer to this4
plea is that there is no money
with which to buy this equip-
ment. A logical answer to.this
is easily forthcoming; let each
student who takes part in in-
-tramural athletics pay a quar-
ter at the beginning of
year, a a spectal fee, separate
from the regular athletic fee
Surely each student would be
willing to pay this amount to
prevent any more ankles be
ing sprained on home plates

ground, or batminton: being
called off because no one
wanted to play with heavy

wooden paddles.

CLASSIC COMMENTS ...

The lone Finn at the recent
Finnish Relief Fund game held

in Tampa,° seeing his first
game of baseball; “The idea
seems to be to take a stick
and stand in front of a man

dressed like an armored tank
and witha stick hit at the pel-
let which another man throws
at great speed. If the man with
the stick can hit the pellet he
makes a dash for one of the
pillows, but instead of putting
his head on it, or sitting on it,
he stands on it. It must take
a lot of money to keep ‘those
pillows clean, ‘It all seemed
very foolish to me, but the
stickers enjoyed it and I guess
I did too.”

“Muscles” Medwick, on be-
ing asked what he would pitch
to himself if he were pitch-
ing; “A straight ball waist-
high—and then duck*’ Ted
Williams, on being asked what
batting form he used: “I just
stand up there and bust ’em.”
