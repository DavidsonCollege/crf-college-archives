Junior Jennie Vanlerberghe
became Davidson’s all-time leader
in blocked shots
during Monday’s
loss to Marshall
in Huntington,
W.Va.

With a first-half
swat, the 6-2 cen-
| ter eclipsed the
previous record
of 85 set by
Kristen Ferrucci last year.
Vanlerberghe’s 86 career blocks

include 28 this season. She is

currently the Southern Conference
leader in blocked shots with an av-
erage of 1.9 per game and is on pace
to record 125 blocks in her career.

KB returns

Sophomore Kerry Brown saw
her first action in about a month in
Saturday’s loss at Furman, making
asuccessful return from an extended
bout with mononucleosis.

The 5-11 forward contributed
three points,
threerebounds, .
and one assist
in 10 minutes,
as coach John
Filar attempts
to gradually
work her back
into the rota-
tion. Brown
“She did fine, and she was a
little winded,” said Filar. “She’s
only had two full practices, so she’ ll

be back.”

Sophomore forward Jessica
Montrella, who is currently bat-
tling mono, should be back in two
weeks and may return in as soon as
ten days, according to Filar.

The Wildcats host Western
Carolina Feb. 11 and play at Geor-
gia Southen on Feb. 15.

Retro gym gives Paladins
home-court advantage

Construction on a new arena at
Furman has pushed both Paladin
basketball teams into the Lay Physi-
cal Activities Center, a 1,200-seat
on-campus facility.

The gym looks more suitable
for high school play than Division I
collegiate action and its floor is
covered with a spiderweb of lines
that confuse even the best referees.

And the noise level was a defi-
nite factor in Saturday’s game, even
though attendance was only 504.

The fact that Furman’s
women’s squad is an unbeaten 7-0
this season in Lay is no coinci-
dence.

_ Big Chance For Fans

There are only a few opportu-
nities left to see the women’s bas-
ketball team at Belk Arena this sea-
son.

This Saturday, the Wildcats
host powerful Appalachian St., a
team picked by the media in the
preseason to win the conference.

The matchup will be region-
ally telecast by SportSouth as part
of a doubleheader with the men’s
squad, which hosts Furman at 2:30
p-m. Tip -time for the women’s
game is noon.

THE WORLDWIDE LEADER
IN DAVIDSON MEN'S AND
WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
COVERAGE.

GREENVILLE, S.C., Feb.

1 - When a team’s in a mut, it

| doesn’t get the breaks. It has to
make the breaks.

And the women’s basketball

team, which

ae has now lost

four straight

after jumping

out to a3-Oconference start, didn’t

do that on Saturday in the loud and

cramped confines of Furman’s Lay
Physical Activities Center.

The Wildcats (11-7, 3-4 SC)
dropped a 78-73 overtime deci-
sion to the Paladins in a game they
should have won in regulation.

With 14 seconds left and
Davidson leading, 64-62, Jamie
Brown left the door open by miss-
ing the front end of a one-and-one.

Guard Haley Cook seized the
opportunity, sending the game into
OT with a runner in the lane at the
buzzer. i

The Paladins (14-5, 6-2)
outscored Davidson, 14-9, in the
extra period for the victory, main-
taining their position atop the
league standings.

As for the Wildcats, what two
weeks ago looked like a team of
destiny is now stuck in the middle

gling to regain its winning form.

“This one was in the bag, and
we opened it up and let it out a little
bit,” said coach John Filar.

“Tt shouldn’t have gone into
overtime. We should have taken
care of our business in regulation.”

And for most of the second

of the conference pack and strug- -

Lady Paladins add
to Wildcat woes

half, the Wildcats did.

Behind Carolyn Kirsch’s 13
points in the final 20 minutes (a
game-high 19 overall) and a solid
crunch-time performance from
rookie center Katy Kamp,
Davidson came back from a 35-30
halftime deficit, playing inspired,
scrappy basketball.

Jen O’Brien equaled her ca-
reer high with 18 points and added
eight rebounds and a team-best
three assists, often carrying the
squad in the first half and over-
time.

Brown and Jennie
Vanlerberghe each pitched in 10
points, and Brown also had eight
boards.

Furman’s Cook killed the
Wildcats all day long, posting 16
points, seven assists, and six
boards, and iced the contest with a
pair of free throws in overtime.

Jackie Smith came off the.
bench to lead the Paladins with 18
points, and Tonya Bristow had a
dozen points and ten boards in the
winning effort.

The Wildcats must now re-
group quickly due to a scheduling
quirk, as they meet the Paladins
again tonight in Belk.

“We can’t dwell on this,”
noted Filar. ““There’s too short a
time until we play them next. It’s
going to be whoever can get their
mental game together come Mon-
day.

“Tt’s just a matter of bouncing
back and hoping someone misses
a shot and we make one. We’re
not that far away. We’re not even
in that deep of a hole. We’re

. okay.”
