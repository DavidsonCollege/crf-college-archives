THE DAVIDSONIAN

ARTS

MONDAY, APRIL 27, 1992

Baby here I am and I’ma
man upon your scene I can
give you what you want,
But you got to come
home with me.

The lead singer of the Nomads
hides his voice behind the band’s
noise every chance he can get.
Maria’s wearing her smile. She
does the quick walk down center
stage, notexactly apageant prance.
With her back to the crowd, she
undoes the strap to the white tas-
scled top, then turns toward the
clapping and hollering. “Keep the
smile,” I’ve always told them, “it
makes’em think your enjoying
yourself.” We look out for our-
selves.

Maria starts her dance. She’s
not greatat it, but she’s good look-
ing enough that the customers don’t
care. I’ve overheard Mark, our
manager, tell Maria her eyes are
fantastic with that devious smile of
hers. He is usually drunk when he
says it, but I think the poor bastard
actually means it, hand on-her ass
and all. I imagine, after he intro-
duced Maria to her devious smile,
she went straight into the dressing
room and found it in that big mir-
ror. Andeven ifshe won’tadmitit,
I imagine there was a part of her
that was proud, almost embar-
rassed. With time she’ll see it
stupid.

I’ve heard others comment on
Maria’s straight black hair. How it
bounces about the center of her
~ back when she dances. They call it

beautiful, they call it fine. But
what most of’em pay attention to
are her breasts. They’re firm for
being so large, but I don’t think
she’s ever been to a surgeon. I’ve
never looked close. enough for
scars. She’s tan from the salon too,
and she never flaunts’em. It makes
the bastards work harder.

I was once good at my work
like Maria. After all, who taught
her all the good tricks. Taught her
to be enthusiastic, but never ex-
cited. Taught her not to think too
much up there. Plenty of time for
that athome when you’ ve got your
money in front of you. If your
mind starts wandering, it’s best to
bring it back by thinking of funny
things. Laughter never hurts. I
forget which lessons I taught her
directly, but those she’d learned
from the others, they’d learned
from me. And she learned well.
Even picked up a couple of her
own tricks.

Never forget that time I saw
her dancing with some man on
stage. (The Paper Dollis one of the
few clubs left that lets men dance
with its dancers. Usually slow, not
too much touching). In the middle
of the dance, Maria slowly counted
the money she had made that night
over the poor fool’s shoulder. The

-crowd ate it up.

WINNERS OF THE VEREEN BELL AWARDS

"PaperDoll"

By Chuck Scofield

Back in the dressing room, I let
the other girls laugh with her a
while before I congratulated her.

“Well done. Well done.” I
said.

“Thanks Allison.” She said to
me turning all pink, still new
enough to think the oldest dancer
knew some things.

“You. know honey” I said,
“you’readifferentsort when you're
up on stage.”

“The lights help.” She said,
hurrying hertop. “Ican’tsee much
of the crowd.”

“That'll come though. Before
too long you'll be smiling and
dancing and scouting’cm out. . .
When I first came to the Doll the
ladies would say how they had
pride intheirdancing. Never called
it dancing though. Strictly strip
tease. It’s the tease thatpays they'd
say.” Maria laughed along with
me at that one. “Anyway, the
ladies used to say some have in-
stinctand some don’t. And I’m not
sure I’ ve ever had it, but it seems to
me you’ ve got it.”

“Thanks,” she said, and her
top was finally fastened.

Laughing with the girls and
giving advice was a loteasier when
I’d been dancing. Sure we prom-
ised we wouldall stay friends, after
all I wasn’t leaving the Doll. But
we’d never been friends really.

When the bastards quit calling
me over for table
dances. . . . well, guess I cared
more about the way they looked at
me than I’d thought. I thought
about visiting the surgeon but quit
dancing instead and started serv-
ing drinks as if the Doll were a
regular bar.

No more staring at my “tits,” I
have my paper doll T-shirtand my
black blue jeans. Get to keep my
hair up when I’m hot, which is
always, and I don’t have to worry
halfas much about the rubbing and
the pinching. Besides I learned
long ago to catch slow hands by
following slow eyes. Mosquitoes
are smarter really.

Pretty little thing let me light
your candle

Cause Mamma I’m sure hard
to handle,

Now yes I am.

Damn guitar player can’teven
keep from prancing around stage
like an idiot. Whenever he has a

. solo, he tries getting the attention

of whoever’s dancing but they just
ignore him.

Maria dances to the Ellen’s
side of the stage where a couple of
men, who look in their thirties, are
sitting. Hal and Rachel Ellen are
an older couple who come to the
Doll at least twice a week. Any of
the-girls will tell you I don’t like
husbands bringing their wives, but

the Ellens are nice quiet people.
Besides, I imagine Mrs. Ellen
would tell you she’s the one who
brings Hal. They always arrive
late in the night, and they always
sit at the same table facing the left
side of the stage. They come to
drink and dance.

Neither of the men sitting near
the Ellen’s table are much to speak
of. Both grow their hair long in
back to try and balance out their
spots that shine in the stage light.
The blonde one’s got a bunch of
bills lined in front of him thinking
he’s pretty cute. I imagine he is the
older of the two.

Maria pulls her G-string up so
the blonde’s friend can slide a
couple of bills beneath it. He lets
his fingers linger beneath the string,
making good and sure the paper
has a secure and sweaty spot. The
blonde then folds a couple of dol-
lars and holds them in his teeth,
this way Maria has to guide him as

_ close as possible, take the money

from his mouth and place it care-
fully beneath the string.

After taking his money Maria
runs to the other side of the stage
where the college kids are in their
baseball hats and T-shirts. They
starevat her with: wet smiles and
glazed eyes, except for one who
will only look up every once ina
while. He was upatthe barearlier:
pretty handsome, blonde hair, blue
eyes, no movie star, but cute. He’s
one of the shy.

The backward hat boy slides a
bunch of onesunder Maria’sstring,
and then waits for her to help him
with the bill between his teeth. She
guides him, then kisses him on the
cheek. Hesmilesred cheeked from
liquor.

Youusually get paid and move
on, but Maria keeps dancing there,
in front of the college kids. She

stays until the shy one looks upand *

smiles a nervous smile. Maria
returns the smile, her first real one

all night. It’s the smile a dancer,

makes when she remembers some-

thing, or someone, and realizes |
she’s on stage half naked, dancing |

for a bunch of eyes. \

Maybe Maria’ sthinking of Jess

and how they met. ButI guess you
could say he’s the reason she came
to the Paper Doll, leaving her to
take care of Melicent, and that is
hardly cause for a real smile.
Maybe she’s just making up to-
morrow’s grocery list.

Maria told me she’s going to
have to quit some time this year,
because soon Mel is going to be
old enough to ask what her Mother
does foraliving. We’ llsee though.
I said the same thing way back and
my daughter grew old enough to
try and understand it. Then again
she married and moved away, but
still I’d be foolish to think that had
anything to do with my work.

Maybe that’s why I try and
look out for Maria, We became

Paper Dolls for ourselves, for our
children. We’readifferent kind of
dancer than Jennifer. Jennifer is at
the Doll to pay her sister’s way
through Medical school, at least
that’s what she says. And that’s
nice and all, but still it makes me
angry if I stop and think aboutit. I
imagine it angers Maria too.
Lately Jennifer has been hav-
ing a difficult time deciding
whether or not she should make
her stage name “Passion” or
“Faith.” Meand Maria have milked
that of all its laughter. Neither of
us has ever seen the point in astage
name. Itseemskind of funny when
you’re showing everything.

Take my hand, don’t be afraid
I’m gonna prove every word I
say

I’m advertising love for free
So won’t you place your ad
with me?

Behind the college kid’s table,
a man’s waving a hundred dollar

bill for Maria. He’s wearing a’

sweater the color of red wine, blue
jeans, and boots. The knuckles
and fingers that hold the hundred
are covered with hair. He’s the’
type to have ape hair on his back.

The idiot on his arm is proba-
bly his wife, could be his girl-
friend. Every time he hollers for
Maria she hits him and tries swal-
lowing her cute nervous laugh
down with her drink.

Slow dancing with men on
stage every now and then wasn’t
too bad, but when they let’em bring
their girlfriends, wives and mis-
tresses, I knew the Paper Doll was

falling. I tell girls that’s the .
reason I quit dancing. I tell’em it
Pp

lacks taste and pride. “They just
want us for some sort of sick inspi-
ration.” I say.

MaybélI started looking alittle
too much like what they are trying
to forgetinstead of something they
wish they could remember. Hell, J
don’t know.

Sull, a hundred dollars is hard
to ignore. Maria adjusts her devi-
ous smile for the bastard, then takes
her time sliding-off stage.

A hundred dollars. Before
Maria had probably even met Jess
and I was just learning to dance for
the Doll, a man approached me at
closing time with a hundred dol-
lars. He was a small man with thin
hair, an older gentleman in hisearly
fifties wearing a business suit, a
banker or lawyer type. Once he
was sure no one was listening he
half-whispered that he wanted to
take me back to his hotel room and
watch me undress. I explained to
him that’s what he’d doneall night.

The hundred dollar catch was
that he wanted to see all of me
naked and he wanted to mastur-

bate. The idea disgusted me and
made me wantto laugh, I was truly
young then, eighteen. I smiled,
and I think I ended up laughing
after all. My daughter Helen was
just a few months old and was
spending the night with her aunt,
so coming home late wasn’t a
problem, and a hundred dollars
was worth a lot more to me then.
When I said it was O.K. he asked
that Ichange in to whatever clothes
I wore outside of work. He wanted
strip, no tease.

Iundressed in frontof him as if
I were getting ready to get in the
shower, and the whole time he did
it he watched me but stayed away
from my eyes. The one time our
eyes met he let out an awkward
laugh, and right before he finished,
as I stood there completely naked
and cold watching him, the poor
fool half-whispered “You are a
goddess.”

I dressed gable while he
cleaned himself up, and he gave
me an extra fifty dollars. I ran
down the four flights of stairs and
straight into a cab, and I was an-"
gered and embarrassed. I wanted
to leave that feeling of power
locked in that room.

After sliding off the stage,
Maria does a good job of immedi-
ately grabbing her top and finding
the straps in back with ease. “You
see,” I once told her, “it’s easy for
a dancer to forget whether or not
she’s wearing her top off stage.
Mirrors, men’s stares, an occa-
sional draft, sure they’re all good
reminders to cover up, but the best
reminder is the tease. Breasts get
boring after a while. You gotta
keep things on, so they’ll pay you
to take’em off.”

Idon’tthink Maria’sever table-
danced with a woman around, but
I think she can handle it. She’s
learned to bring the lights off stage
with her.

There was the time she was
table-dancing for this guy I was
bringing gin and tonics. The worst
part of. waitressing at the Doll is
waiting for the money. If the girls
are facing me it’s not so bad, I can
at least give’em a wink ora smile.
But with their backsides to me, it’s
plain awkward. :

The gin and tonic man patted
her on the ass and said, “Can I ask
you something?”

She turned around and an-
swered, “Sure, it’s your money.”
Not bad.

“Does it bother you that we
stare. Like before I couldn’t; and
even rightnow I can’t, stop staring
at your. .. . at your tits.”

- “Honestly,” she said, sound-
ing all sincere, likeshe was giving
a tour, “I don’t watch you watch-
ing me, but no it don’t bother me.”

“Sounds good.” The bastard
