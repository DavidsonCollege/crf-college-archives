The coming of winter means
winter term, college and pro bas-
_ketball, and the Winter Drama
Workshop season. Student-per-
formed and directed plays are pro-
duced every Thursday and Friday
at 7 p.m. in Cunningham Fine
Arts Building. The following two
plays were put on last week.
Dutchman by LeRoi Jones:
Directed by senior Paul Kos-
mas, who was assisted by senior
Wayne Magruder, the action takes
place on a moving train. Junior
Vincent Knight played Clay, a
young intellectual who meets with
a universal — nightmate — a
stranger who will not leave you

alone. The stranger is Lula, a.

hooker played by senior Christi
Hayes. Senior Eric McClarty
played the conductor, senior
Kerry Brown a young man with a
Bible, and junior Bill Madden a
drunk. They have about two sen-
tences in the play. The rest of the
play is a dialogue between Clay
and Lula.

This play has all the curses of a
one-act. With only one hour, the
writer is tempted to drop plot and
go for talk about every vast issue
of the cosmos. Jones fell for this
solution. Clay emerges as an over-
blown symbol of the castrated,

middle-class black. Lula is the.
sexually repressed but secretly ©

lustful white. Their delirious en-
counter on a train is supposed to
symbolize the entire truth about
race and sex.

The whole play has a delirious
unreality. Lula _ alternately
screams and sexually teases Clay.
You wonder why he would put up

_ with such an obnoxious stranger. °

Clay is pretty cold and frigid, un-
able to make up his mind on any-

thing. You wonder why a whore ~

would put up with such a slow
trick. They cavort, argue and fight
on a public train with other pas-
sengers. You wonder why nobody
calls the conductor.
The play had a few moments.
Kosmas kept the play moving at a
rapid clip with the appropriate
train sounds. Knight and Hayes
took on their roles with energy and
skill. They even got a few laughs
out of the sexual tension between

Brazil thrives on dense visual

By PRISCILLA FAWCETTE

Terry Gilliam’s Brazil is an
uneven, off-the- wall comedy,
which has nothing to do with the
country Brazil.

Somewhere in the twentieth
century, Sam Lowery (Jonathan
Pryce), a lowly. clerk in the Minis-
try of Information Records De-

partment is promoted to the
Ministry of Information Re-
trieval. This is an opportunity that.
any ambitious young man would
jump at, except complacent Sam.
He’s quite content in his present

their characters. Knight played
the -mildness and confusion of
Clay in the right key, while Hayes
got all the pyrotechnics as Lula.
Good performances and good di-
rection struggled with a bad play.

Wild Roses by John Marks,
"85:

Directed by senior Laeta
Kalogridis, who was helped by
sophomore Mac Hardcastle, the
play was written by a Davidson
alumnus. It is set in a hospital bed-
room. Sophomore Margaret Han-
cock played Sarah, the repressed
and dominated daughter of a
Southern family. Senior Michele
Miller played grandma, her tyran-
nical mother who is recuperating.
Sophomore Mibs Raney played
Angie, the rebellious granddaugh-
ter. Senior Caroline Vinson
played nurse Stipes.

The characters in the play are
all Southerners, and this situation
has its own temptations. Ever
since Faulkner and Tennessee
Williams, morbid and bizarre be-

- havior has become the literary use

(and abuse) -of the American
South. No Southern family can be
normal without some incest. At
the same time, southerners go off
into beautiful, poetic — flights
beyond the range of. Yankees.
There is the South, and there is the
South of the literary mind.

Marks gave in completely to
this temptation. Before long, the
rebellious Angie relates her sexual
profile. Poor Sarah, her fragile
dreams ripped apart in childhood,
has a nervous breakdown. Nurse
Stipes is too common to under-
stand. The play comes down to a
struggle for power and freedom
between Grandma and Angie.
These themes have been done be-
fore. é

The entire cast did well in their
roles. Hancock, Miller and Raney
had the major roles, and held up
under the limelight. Vinson kept
her country accent without a miss.
Kalogridis did some interesting
tricks with the spotlights which
helped the play’s themes. There
was one problem. Angie, despite
being brought up in the South, had
no Southern accent. Do you have
to be a Yankee to be liberated?

dead-end position, until he
realizes that this promotion will
give him the chance to find the girl
of.his dreams.

Jill (Kim Greist) is a truck
driver who looks exactly like the
medieval damsel in distress of
Sam’s fantasies. When he does
find her, she thinks he’s crazy and
he.thinks she’s a terrorist. Need-
less to say, though a continuous
thread of interest, the plot is es-
sentially unimportant to the film
as it gives way to that all-ambigu-
ous term, “atmosphere.”

If you can, see “The Purple
Flower” and “Tongues.” Both
plays are different from the norm.
Fhey are not comedies. They are
not clear-cut tragedies: In fact, at
sometime it is questionable as to
whether there is a legitimate plot
in either of the plays. Why should
you se these plays? See these
plays because they are explora-
tive, bizarre (in the case of
“Tongues”), and above all else,
moving; and that is the purpose of
drama. ‘|

“The Purple Flower” depicts
the struggle of racism, pitting a
cast of eight black actors and ac-
tresses against two white charac-
ters who are referred to as the
Male White Devil and the Female
White Devil. The play is written
from the viewpoint of blacks. It
deals with their perception of, and
reactions to, the two White Devils
who parade themselves in tux and

Running amuck throughout
this futuristic land are life-like
pipes, ducts, tubes, and numerous
electronic gadgets which seem to
be the modus operandi for all en-
terprises and private life.

Ironically, nothing seems to
work very well, if at all: Sam’s
heating system breaks down, his
coffee-maker soaks his breakfast
toast, an old woman’s face-lift
falls apart, and Mr. Buttle is killed
instead of Mr. Tuttle. This pile of
inefficiency and mistakes is
buried beneath more piles of

Senior Eric McClarty gives a
stirring performance as, an old
man who strives for the création of

a third race of godly men to do

away with racism altogether. I
feel his role: in “The Purple
Flower” is a much more demand-
ing role than his performance in
“Sweeny Todd” last fall and he
plays it beautifully.

Excellent performances were
also given by sophomores Melissa
Givens, as an old lady, and Mau-
reen Harris, in the part of Cor-
nerstone.

“Tongues” is a very different
sort of play. “Tongues” is an indi-
vidual exploration of communica-
tion and death. The play contains

white, who deliver personal mes-

seems. to mind that terrorists in-
frequently attack shopping cen-
ters, restaurants, and private citi-
zens. A government minister pro-
claims, “‘we have it under con-
trol,” and billboards announce
“Happiness, we’re all in this to-
gether.”

Despite its cultural commen-
taries, Brazil is no 1984, nor a pre-
diction of life in the near future.
This film is a purposely unrealistic
mixture of extremes; grotesque,
comedy, horror and pathos meet

peculiar sounds of a one man

ter stage.

Has this made, sense? No?

Robert Nesbit

That’s what I thought when I,saw

the play. However, this is an un-
just crack for the play is clearer
than I have made it out to be.

The acting is as consistantly
good as the characters are interest-
ing. The characters range from a
neurotic schizophrenic, played by
sophomore Brett Bakke, to a see-
ing-blind man played by senior

- James Pittard. Pittard has a natural

innocence on stage that makes
him likable and believable.

These certainly aren’t profes-
sional presentations, but this is not
Broadway. This is Davidson and
admission is only two.dollars. See
“The Purple Flower’ and
“Tongues.” The worth of these
performances far exceeds the
cost.

turns into a chaotic nightmare.
Unfortunately, it occasionally
seems to turn into a boring late-
night video. Isolated and over-

done sections cause the film to

lag. However, Brazil works from
a clever idea and is sprinkled with.

interesting characters interpreted
by talented actors, such as Robert
DeNiro, Katherine Helmond and
Bob Hoskins.
