Tempus fugit. Junior Speaking three
and a half weeks off.

A very pathetic voice was heard Mon-
day night singing, “O where is mv wan-
dering bed tonight?”

Riddle: Which do students look for
first in the paper, the basketball games,
or the war news.

Maybe it was fortunate after all that
the Freshmen had a little military train-
ing last Fall.

FIRE...

The almost serious fire that occurred
in Watts Saturday night, brings up
again the question of unpreparedness in
case of accidents of that nature. And
it is a sane and important question, for
despite the constant danger of fire in
the dormitories, where there are clectric
wires and matches in every room, there
is absolutely no’ provision made for ac-
cident. It was kindly fortune that
caused the ignition to occur in a room
where there was running water instead
of in Rumple, where the H2O would
have to be carried in tumblers, else
Davidson would probably have been
minus a dormitory. There ought to be
fire extinguishers in every hall.

Should a whole building catch afire,
the plight would be even worse. There
are on the campus, we believe, two
lengths of fire hose, and by diligent
search they can he found carefully
stowed away in the Power House. But
the fact has been known by only a few
in the student body.

Tt is to be hoped that with the build-
ing of the new water tank and the ad-
ditional pressure, that some system of
fire fighting, not only for the college,
but for the village will be formed. It
might not be a had idea for the Fresh-
men to compose a fire department and
have it a part of their gymnasium work
to practice “fire drill.”

SOPH BANQUET.

An exchange has written an article
that we feel is so uniquely appropriate

The DAVIDSONIAN. February 7. 1917

his week, that we cannot but print it

“Experience and observation have
helped us solve the banquet. We knov
the creature by heart. It is always
‘taged by progressive would be’s. Ever:
hanquet is the best ever. This is tact-
fully understood.

“The various committees have severa’
objects. The committee on menu is the
real rip-snorter. It is made up of lan-
guage students and dictionary delver:
with a society twist. They do their
dumdest and the menu looks it. If any-
body can decipher the menu the ban-
quet is a failure.

“The committee on victuals gets the
next whack. They select the liquid and
solid torture and match it with the
names. This committee is mostly made
up of would-be cooks and the results
show it. Their object is to serve as
little as possible, but to make that little
last. It generally does. We know a
case where it lasted forever. This han-
quet was a success.

“At a banquet nobody can eat in
neace. There is the gaseous torture.
This is the worst. Just as you have
discovered a microscopic salad on vour
olate a toast is announced. You look
for the toast, but see that you have been
fooled. Tt is a gassy toast. You have
lost vour salad in the bargain. It can-
not he rediscovered. Perhaps a fly has
put it in its pocket. This performance
is served in relays on some occasions.
On others the gassv part comes last.
This is fortunate, for you can sleen
thru this torture. No matter when this
part comes, it is awful. The eats are
venerally as bad as the names. The
whole thing is rotten. but vou praise
everything. As a result the hanquet is
a great success, Why? Recause every-
hody says so.”

DATES OF CONTESTS
IN LITERARY SOCIETIES

A number of contests are scheduled
for the coming months in the two liter-
ary societies. The first of these is the
Fresh-Soph Declamation Contest. to he
held on March 19, and to which the

a the Fresh-Sonh Debate is scheduled.
but the query for this contest has not
vet heen decided unon by the Debating
Council. The preliminaries in the Tun-
ior-Senior Debate will be held on April
16, and the finals on April 30, the sub-
ject for this also to be announced at an

tween 1.200 and 3.500 words, and must

DAVIDSON STUDENT
LOSES HIS FATHER

The news of the sudden death, Sun-
day afternoon, of “Jack” Black’s father
came as a shock to the whole campus.

He had apparently been in his usual] §

good health until he was stricken with

acute indigestion, passing away after al fl

brief illness of only half an hour.

Dr. Black was about §2 years of age.
and has been a practicing physician in
Cabarrus Countv for about 25 years.
He is survived by his widow, five sons
and two daughters.

“Jack” may feel sure that considera-
‘ion and heartfelt sympathy go out to
him from everyone at Davidson College.
and especially from his many strone
friends both here on the campus and
«Isewhere.
