DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C. FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 1963

Student Council Endorses

1963 Wil

BY BILL AITKEN
Davidsonian Staff Writer

dcat Handbook

“The, prospective college student is usually presented only the rosy side of col-

legiate life in college publications,” state

d freshman John Leet at Monday’s Student

Council meeting. ‘Therefore,’ Leet continued, “although I personally feel that the
handbook helped me to adjust to college, I think that its presentation would have dis-
couraged me had I received it before acceptance.”

After some discussion by the
members of the council and
those students who attended the
open meeting, the council decid-
ed upon two actions which it
‘would take in regard to the
Wildcat Handbook.

The first action was in the
form of a letter to Editor Tim
Kimrey and his staff commend-
ing them for a job well done.

The second action was the
following resolution vunani-
monsly adopted: “The Student
Council wishes to endorse the

Wildest Handbook for 1963-
64 and commend Editor Kim-
rey and staff for their out-
standing work. The Student
Council also advocates the
continuation of a publication
similar in format, content, and
overall approach for future
years.”

The Student Council adopted
a proposed budget of $910 for
the current school year. This
budget is submitted to the stud-
ent body financial committee for
action and proposed adoption.

Philanthropic Society
Plans Improvements

“Philanthropic Literary Society has long been on the
‘dead list’ at Davidson; this year we are changing that.”

So opens the letter sent by Phi to its members this
week. “The letter has caused a lot of comment around
campus,” echoed Phi President Charles Dibble. “We’ve
had a big response and none of it has been bad.”

As to getting Phi off the dead
wood list, Dibble retorted, ‘‘You
can count on that!” Supporting
Dibble are Bill Rule, vice-presi-
dent; Jim Graves, secretary;
Everett Huggins, treasurer; Tim
Kimrey and Dan Broadhead as
first and second critics respec-
tively; and Jim Stringfield, par-
liamentarian.

The letter tackled the big
problem which has plagued’ the
society — that of purpose. The
attack will be centered around
“the conception of ideas and the
communication of ideas and
feelings.”

To stimulate creative thought
away from “our own Piedmont
world,” many programs will be
on topics of controversy outside
Davidson. This will be accom-
plished by discussion, book re-

views and informed speakers.

“Not only will Phi be con-
cerned with the conception of
ideas, but also the group will
seek to develop methods of
communicating ideas.” Phi’s
place, according to the letter, is
the development of communica-
tion in the areas of writing and
debate.

Phi's twice monthly meetings
have been changed to accommo-
date its purpose. “The format to
be followed will include (1) a
fifteen-minute book review by
one of the members, (2) a thirty-
minute, four-man debate of the
cross-examination type on a ser-

‘ious, pre-arranged and research-

ed topic, and (3) fifteen minutes
of criticism and discussion on
what has preceded.”

.as secretary-treasurer of

John Spratt, Student Coun-
cll president, sppointed the
following committee chairmen
and members.

To the Magazine Advisory
Board, Spratt appointed Joel
Morrisett and Walt MacDonald.
This board works in connection
with the Scrips ‘'n Pranks pub-
lication. The editor of the humor
magazine, Hank Ackerman, has
already begun work on the first
of four issues for this year. John
Barrow is to continue in charge
of the gun room.

Fred McGuirt was named to
the Academic Scheduling Com-
mittee and Bruce Swain will
serve on the Non-academic
Scheduling Committee.

Three men were asked to
serve on the Student Body Fi-
nance Committee—MacDonald,
Hill Wellford and Andy Little,
the
Student Council.

Of course, the first thought

Each shelter will be equipped

water. This preparation is being
handled by Mrs. Rethal Moore.

supplies will be at a minimum;
students are requested to bring
any personal médication. with
them—along with their toilet
articles.

Any battery operated radios
will, without doubt, be of cardin-
al importance. Operators may
tune to WBT or, in the case of
television, to WBTV in order to
obtain instructions. Medical
supervision in the shelter areas
will be under the direction of
Dr. J. B. Woods, while Dr. John
Hopkins will be in charge of
communications.

One of the greatest dangers
in any mass emergency is that
of an all-out rush for the tele-
phones, For this reason, and be-
cause the phone lines must be
kept open, residents of the Dav-
idson area are requested not to
attempt to place any calls.

Should the unlikely happen—
atomic attack—the signal will be
one long (five minute) blast by
the campus or town siren. Stud-
ents should immediately return
to their dormitories to get any
needed articles, then go to their
respective shelters. They should
take with them any recreational
equipment, as the period of con-
finement might last for two
weeks.

issues confronting our age.
MacDonald spent pert of his
spring vacation visiting Dart-
mouth College and studying
its Great Issues Program. The
Dartmouth program is a week-
ly seminar course which is
required of all seniors as a
prerequisite for graduation, «

It was decided that the David-
son Great Issues Program would
consist of lectures, informal dis-
cussions and films, all of which
would center around a central
theme for each semester.’

MacDonald’s committee, now
expanded to 16 members, has
chosen “Emerging Africa’ as
the emphasis for the first semes-
ter and “The Changing South”
for the second. The committee
has been divided into three
groups to handle publicity, re-
search and administration of
the program. Dr. Phillip B.
Secor, assistant professor of po-
litieal science, is serving as ad-
visor.

The purpose of the program
is to help the students at David-
son become more acutely aware
of the problems facing our na-
tion and the world today. Howell
says, “This new program is a
terrific opportunity for David.
son College and the Davidson
man to grow and become aware.
of the world. It should greatly
enrich education outside the
classroom.”

Grosschmid’s lectures will be
followed by an assembly on Oct.
14 on the subject of South
Africa’s racial policy of apart-
heid. The speaker will be Stew-
art King, a former reporter for
the Johannesburg, South Africa,

Other speakers and their
topics are Dr. Vernon McKay
of Johns Hopkins University

“Africa in World Politics;” the
Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole, nation-
al. chairman of the Zimbabwe
African Peoples Union of South-
ern Rhodesia, who will discuss
African nationalism; and David
Newson of the US. State Depart-

United States’ responsibility to
the emerging nations.

Prior to each lecture every
student will receive a three

background information for
each talk. This materia! is in-

Twenty-One Married Men

Perhaps one of the greatest incentives to
efficient scheduling is knowing that every
minute counts. If this sounds unbelievable,
just ask any of Davidson’s 21 married stud-

ents.

Despite the obvious fact that married life
and supporting a family is a time-consuming
task, there are married men in almost every
organization on campus. Among them are
such family men as Fred McGuirt, Haynes

Kelly and Dick Fulp.

MecGuirt is president of the Senior Class
and a member of both Omicron Delta Kappa
and Sigma Chi. Kelly is president of the

Interfraternity Council and a

Kappa Alpha Order. Fulp is a member of
the football team, the D Club and Phi

Gamma Delta.

Although many of the family men prefer
to remain independent, 14 of them do be-
long to social fraternities. Sigma Chi seems

to have the monopoly on the

ried set at present with five married

brothers. In fact, one of the

Jan Hart, is the sweetheart of the fraternity.

predominant

‘Stay In Campus Activities

Quarterback Benny Coxton is the only
head of a family of more than one child,
but many of the others have one, with the

trend toward young girls.

The oldest marriage is the Fulp’s; Dick

and Barbara have been married for over
four years, whereas Bill Joyner was married
only last Saturday.

When asked about: problems engendered
by married life in a society of bachelors, all

seemed to feel that the advantages far oit-

weighed the

member of

disadvantages.

The one major complaint was the inad-
equacy of housing, especially that afforded
by the college. “I think it’s pretty poor
that the college won’t provide enough hous-
ing for the married students,” said one wife.

“Some of them end up having to commute

young mar-

wives, Mrs.

to classes from as far away as-Charlotte.”

All in all, the married students and their
wives seem to have made the transition to
life at Davidson with the same speed and
ease that are characteristic of all their
activities, a wonderful example of adapta-
tion and intelligence.
