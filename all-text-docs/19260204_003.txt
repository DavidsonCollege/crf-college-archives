Here lies the body of Sophomore Houck,
He laughed at his girl when her teeth
fell out.

| ON EXAM
He had the old prof “spotted.”
It really was a shame.
He sat down then right calmly,
| And coolly wrote his name.

| And then his groans grew heavy,
| A tear his paper blots,

| For he was like a leopard—

He could not change his “spots.”

“T went to a stag party last night, dearie.”
“Yes, I heard you staggering as you come

The only consolation in being knock-

Mrs. Mosstongue—“‘Henry, you were
talking in your sleep last night.”

Mr. M.—“Well, pardon me for inter-

THE SMALL COLLEGE

They're small compared with
some of our monster schools; their en-
