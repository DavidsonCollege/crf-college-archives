THE DAVIDSONIAN

OPINIONS

MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 1994 9

Back from France:
Chris Frampton

I've had a vision.

Daiving cross-country this sum-
mer, I passed a town claiming to
have “the world’s largest ball of
string.” Billboards announced the
sight for miles—hundreds of miles,
in fact. I think I was in Kansas,
though I can’t really be sure; Kan-
sas, Missouri and the eastern part
of Colorado look a lot alike.

Anyway, I’ve had a vision.
Davidson needs to get some more
insurance cash. We need to pro-
vide a supplemental flow of the
juice so that we can abSolve this
silly no under-age drinking thing.
The government—the one in
Washington—won’t give us some
pretty important funds if we do,
but if we can get money elsewhere,
we don’t need their stinking pig
product.

So Ihave an idea. We can put
up signs, billboards, big ones with
flashing lights and stuff like that.
Advertising what you may won-
der; I'll tell you: the “World’s
Largest Bug Zapper!”

Yes, the new senior apartment,
so beautifully named “F,” may well
be the world’s largest bug zapper.
Sure they don’t die instantly, but
they do die’a slow, painful death,
burned to a crisp under the heat of
over 35,000 fluorescent lights.

But I’ve had another vision.
When I first laid my eyes on the
beautiful “F’ building, I felt as if I
had crossed over, or least into, a
liminal state. A time of transition.
Walking toward the building for
the first time, I am sure I caught a
glimpse of St. Peter, smiling
broadly with a gigantic clip board
in hand. :

“Name, son?” .

“Harrison Roberts.” I lied.

“Welcome to Heaven,
Harrison.”

It probably wasn’t fair to lie,
but I know I wouldn’t get in on my
own, so I borrowed the
Leprechaun’s name. He’s prob-
ably a little pissed off about it,
faced with spending the rest of
eternity in Hell. But what do I
care; I’m an angel.

Speaking of eternity, itrhymes
with fraternity. And I would make
a transition into a discussion of
those honored bastions of drugs,
alcohol, and testosteroneright now,
but that might lead some to believe
that Heaven and fraternities have
something incommon, which they
don’t.

Well, actually they do: brain
dead people populate them. (Yes,
Iknow the people in Heaven are all
the way dead.) Thankfully, I am
proud to count myself as a member
of the brain dead. Now if that isn’t
a full-on endorsement for going
Greek, I do not know what is.

Not that it matters, for I have
seen the future of Davidson’s fra-
ternities and eating houses, and it
is not a pretty sight. No, it is an
ugly one, and it has a lot to do with
a big dorm right in the middle of
Patterson Court. This building is
huge, as in they would tear down
the houses. Oh, well, I will gradu-
ate soon enough. You freshmen
won’t, so welcome to Davidson.

Chris Frampton has been here awhile.

Before I arrived at Davidson, I
imagined what it would be like.
What it would feel like actually
being around and knowing white
people for the first time. I knew it
would be different from my past,
considering the fact that my high
school was blacker than Davidson
is white. Limagined white students
calling me “nigger” and moving
the the other side of the street when
they saw me walking in their direc-
tion. I sincerely thought I would
meet a lot of stuffy, over-
priviledged, self-serving, racist
white people.

So, why did I come anyway?
Probably because I felt the same

_ way about the entire white popula-

tion in this country and felt I should
be exposed to it before I got out

‘into the real world. Probably be-

cause I wanted to prove to myself
that the stereotype about the black
race being cognitively inept sim-
ply was nottrue, and I could do this
by studying alongside those “su-
perior” beings that I heard so much
about. Ican say now that my view
is a bit different, but still not totally
positive.

There was a time when being
overtly racist was not only toler-
ated and accepted in this country,
but enjoyed by almost everyone

who benefited from it. And even
though we can see that times have
changed, I’m not sure that they are
necessarily better now. It is obvi-
ous that hatred towards us still
exists—groups such as skinheads
and the KKK constantly remind
me of that. When I’m walking
down the road, and someone in the
passing car yells out “nigger,” Iam
reminded. But what I see on this
campus is a bit different.

An incident from my fresh-
man yeaf sheds light on this view.
I remember walking on campus
during the first week of school
with a fellow underclassman who
happened to be white. While we
were walking, we were stopped by
a senior male, and he greeted us
both in that same nice manner that
all Davidson students are known
for. So, we engaged in a small
conversation. First, he asked the
guy I was walking with what he
planned to major in, and of course

do play football.

he gave some answer that- sug-
gested that he had not thought about
it a great deal. Immediately, he
turned to me and asked a question.
But instead of asking me about my
future major, he asked me what
sport I played.

On the surface, that sounds
pretty harmless, right? After all, I
And here was
some nice fellow, who probably
did not have a racist bone in his
body, caring enough to make me
feel welcome. The reason this is
even worth mentioning is not the
fact that maybe I looked more ath-
letic than the other guy, but simply
because I then knew that this per-
son was insensitive to my feel-
ings—and my worth—without
even knowing it. It’s important
because it shows that it is highly
possible to discriminate without
being racist.

do you see when I mention the -
words “welfare recipient?” You
probably see some big black guy
and some lazy, pregnant black
woman. You see this even though
70 percent of all drug users in this
country are white. You see this
even though there are twice as many
white people living in poverty as
blacks and Hispanics combined.
When do stereotypes play a
major part in our lives? When we
do not get to know anyone that is
different from us, because then the
stereotype is the only thing we
have to go on. Just as I was igno- -
rant to the fact that you can be a
white person in this country with-
out being racist, most students on
this campus are ignorant to the fact
that minorities on this campus are
made to feel unwanted and dis-
liked because of insensitivity, not
necessarily because of some un-
written form of covert racism.
When things get really bad for us
on this campus, itis not when some-
one calls us a “nigger”—no stu-
dent has yet to say that to me—but
rather when people act as though I
am some strictly physical being
who got in because of affirmative
action. In other words; you do not

Ana so here I am. Who is this

character who’s quietly wormed
his way onto the already-swollen
and vacuous Opinions page? I'll
try an introduction: “Lover of popu-
lar art and friend of iced teas every-
where, Chad Ossman hails from
..” No, [ll aim for something a
little more long-form and hope-
fully more humble.

And so here I am. Having
turned the proverbial page, I’ve
found myself back at Davidson for

| athird year. Welcome or not, I’ve

arrived with several unexpected
possessions. I have a truly private
place for the first time in my life: a
single, my sanctum sanctorum. I
may have the privilege of a steady
voice and audience in The David-
sonian. (have recently been ren-
dered unattached by forces I do not
fully understand. I’ve conjured a
rudimentary home studio for my
guitar out of a jumble of lengths of
cords and hunks of electronics.
And, I have settled into a major,
unfortunately after years of intense
deliberation and a few more errors
than trials.

And so here I am, wondering
what exactly I am going to do with
my new life at Davidson. So far,
nothing extraordinary. Partying
and tomcatting are not in my job
description. My major is begin-
ning to scare me, for 1 ama washin
reams of text, demanding profes-
sors, and classmates more intelli-
gent and experienced than me. And
meanwhile, somewhere in the
murky nether regions of my brain,

ing if I can make a useful and
authentic contribution to The
Davidsonian . Perhaps I should
end with a Grand Point, something
like “Walk with God and you shall
never fear losing volleyball again,”
or “beer is the consummate social
lubricant, excepting perhaps the
latex condom.” ;

More likely I will attempt to
carve out a rough narrative of
Davidson from my perspective,
peppered, of course, with all the
contentious opinions and wry ob-
servations I can muster. Or, if I
absolutely cannot think of any-
thing tosay, [can always make fun

Perhaps what Davidson needs
is its very own personal classifieds!
It could be right here in The David-
sonian. Students and professors of
all ages can submit personal ads
explaining their wants and needs

already:

Then again, maybe we should
stick to the troublesome Davidson
way. It’s tradition, and if you’re
just clever and witty enough, you
might find one of those mighty:
elusive relationships.

Maybe even for twenty
seven minutes.
