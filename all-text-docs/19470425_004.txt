As

Last wek gave every indication
of another poor dance week end.
The ticket sales weren't going too
good and two out of the four ath-
letic teams were going to be on
the road. For various reasons not
many of the fraternities were hay-
ing banquets, and in general things
pointed to the same fate as had
; befallen the mid-winter dances.
There, too, was the uncertainty, of
the music, and for that reason some
of the boys did not wish to attend.
p For all those that did attend, it
jean be said that they and their
dates enjoyed the best set of dances
given by the Pan-Hellenic Council
in many years. From the veterans
that attended Davidson before-the
war and knew how good Davidson
dances used to be come statements
that this dance set was just as good,
if not better, than those given in
prewaryears.._Said Harvey Car-
row and George Ennett, “These
dances were as good as any ever
held here and certainly one of the
fastest breaking dances ever at-
tended while at Davidson.”

From this corner a few inquiries
were made about what those who
attended the dances.though of them
as a whole. Questions asked con-
cerned the music, breaking, stags,
and general appearance of the
Armory. From Bill McLean czme,
“Very acceptable music. It wasn’t
Tex Beneke’s, but nevertheless very
good music to dance to.” Bill Law-

son expressed himself by saying,
“The stags were the thing that
made the dance different from the
others. The boys without dates did
their duty and thus gave us our
best set in a long time.” Mullett-
Head spoke for the crowd when he
said that the girls on hand were
the best looking group he had ever
seen. That is pretty good coming
from “Wheel Ed”. “Harry High
School” Adams ran true to form
when he said he thought his “neck-
ing” date made the dance. (Who
else can verify this statement of
Rhea’s?)

No article on the dances would
be complete without handing a bou-
quet to the Pan-Hellenic Council for
the work they did on acquiring
Billy Knauff and his orchestra and
for the job they did in decorating
the Armory. All those who feared
the quality of the music, soon had
all this erased when B. K. and com-
pany gave out with the Sweetest
music heard in a long time. A very
good job was done in making the
big auditorium very attractive.
From all sides came compliments
for the decorations committee.

From those very gracious crea-
tures who attended the dances came
glowing remarks. All those inter-
viewed about what they thought of
the music and the breaking said
that this set was the best set of
Davidson dances they had ever at-
tended. Those who did not know
Knauff could hardly believe that
his was a local outfit. One even
said that this was the first time
she had heard “this band” since she
had seen him in a big Chicago hotel.

Frolics Proclaimed Success

Imagine her surprise when she was
informed later in the dance that
this band had never been in Chi-
cago. Some people certainly bend
over backwards to hand out compli-
ments. When asked whether the
boys were’ showing» them a good
time, all remarked that the break-
ing was very fast. This is where
this column wants -to hand out
thanks” to those noble gents who
gave very able assistance and play-
ed such a big part in giving us our
best chance of the year.

As far as is known, the conduct
of all present was very good and
true to Davidson form. From
“Social” Sam Tate, chairman of
the “Twenty One” Club for this
dance, came the report that from
all he saw and heard the conduct
was better than that of the Mid-
Winters set. Is his an indication
of a coming improvement? This
matter of drinking, or I should say
lack of drinking at Davidson dances
is one thing that always brings
praises from the girls. From those
girls who have attended some of
the orgies sponsored by other col-
leges came the remarks, “Not hav-
ing to dance with a host of drunk
boys certainly adds a desire to at-
tend more Davidson dances. The
absence of drink certainly makes
for a better time for most of the
girls.” With this fact in» mind,
let us look for continued improve-
ment next year.

With the last dance of the year
over, we can look back on it and
hope the pattern has been set for
all our functions in the future. This
dance has proved that if the boys
who do not have dates will come
as stags, they and the others with
dates can expect a very enjoyable
week end. From now on let’s sup-
port the Pan-Hell and show our
visiting dates that Davidson can
sponsor the best dances in the cir-

“cuit.

The fraternity dance was held

Tommy Powell, master pf cere-

of keeping the brothers in stitches
and the girls embarrassed.

Tsk, tsk! It is heard via the

can’t you hold your women any

It is acclaimed by most of the
