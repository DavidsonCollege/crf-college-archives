Stetson “D” Burglarized |

Burglary in Davidson reached alarming
Proportions Monday night when the Stetson |
“D” establishment on Main Street was forci- |
bly entered’ by unknown parties. Raymond
Harrison, local manager for Stetson “D” |
reports that nearly one thousand dollars |
worth of goods is missing as a result of the
crime. Twenty-one suits of ready made
clothing were removed along with a number
of minor articles. No evidence tending to fos
cate the criminals has come to light. |

The breaking occurred after twelve o'clock | |
Monday night. Apparently the thief at-
tempted an entrance through the rear door, |
since the glass in that door was found
broken. Thwarted at this point, the criminal |
proceeded to smash the plate glass in the |
front door, his intrusion at this |
the goods through the |
street, where it is pre- |
awaited him, since the
quantity of stolen goods was too great to
be easify carried away on foot. |

General alarms were sent to neighboring |
towns in the hope that the thief might be
apprehended, but no results were forth com-
ing. At present the case rests as an unsolved
minystery.

Combined Meeting

On Tuesday evening, January 28, the Eu- |
manean and Philanthropic Literary Socie-
ties met in Philanthropic Hall to hear an|
address by Professor Archibald Currie. Prac- |
tically the entire program was given over to
Professor Currie’s message.

Speaking in his characteristic manner,
Doctor Currie conducted a rambling discus-
sion based on his own experiences as a pub-
lic speaker, and’as an instructor of that art. |
He cited several instances, which showed |
the value of being able to express one’s self
capably. He lamented the decline in the local
forensic spirit as compared with that of the
past, and he made a fertile suggestion, which
may possibly lead to a renewal of interest.

The attention of the audience was evident
throughout the meeting, and outbursts of
laughter-were not infrequent as the speaker
illustrated his points with humorous _inci-
dents of by-gone years.

“My Life As An Explorer”

One of the most interesting books that has

The style in which the book is written is
Mr.
Amundsen as a college graduate possessed
the rare ability to tell his story concisely yet
fully and at the same time round out the
entire account so as to leave the reader with
a satisfactory feeling of completeness. It is
not without humor in many. parts, and at
all times reserves a simple dignity and ideal-
ism for the profession of polar exploration.
The book is three hundred pages of delight-
ful, graphic narration of the life of a man
who dedicated his life to scientific explora-
tion in the far-removed polar areas with the
hope that such knowledge would benefit the
present and future generations.

Over the Horizon

H™ they come—the nucleus of an_ all-electric
merchant marine. Yesterday, they were a dream.
To-day, they are well over the horizon, linking the ports
of the east and west coasts with fortnightly service. The
goal of the Panama Pacific Line is to build three more
turbine-electric ships, thus enabling weekly New York-
Frisco sailings.

Even now, the three liners, California, Virginia, and
Pennsylvania, constitute the largest fleet of turbine-electric
commercial ships in the world.

Besides propelling these ships, electricity hoists freight,
raises anchors, mans pumps, turns rudders, drives winches,
and warps the vessels into their berths. It lights lamps,
spins fans, operates elevators, cools and cooks food. Its
magic touch is apparent on every deck.

All electric equipment, above and below deck, is a prod-
uct of General Electric.

The planning, production, and distribution of such
equipment has been largely the responsibility of college-
trained men who are working with General Electric and
who have aided in bringing these ships over the horizon,
