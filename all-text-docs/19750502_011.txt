News rules finally printed as-
all tournaments get underway

By PAUL BANTA
and AL EDMONDS

We have received the
anguished cries of many IMAC
participants the last few weeks
concerning the absence of
their teams from this column.
For them we issue the following
steps for one’s team to follow to
insure recognition:

1) Win all your games and/or
lead your division

2)Lose all your games or be
last in your division

3) Beat a top team

4) Lose to a top team spec-
tacularly

5) Play on the same team
with the author of this column.

Only the best and fhe
brightest and the worst and the
weakest get the spotlight. But,
for this week, we’ll make an ex-
ception and mention almost all
the teams.

In the words of Senator
Roman Hruska (Rep.-Neb).
“Don’t the mediocre people of
this county deserve some
representation?”’

Both the — softball
volleyball tournaments started
this week. In softball. the
Beavers punched out the
Ragmen, the Cleveland Browns
Ko’d KA#2. and were then
given a bve to the final eight as
both C-IIT and PDT “‘B”’ forgot
to show.

The Gozinvas edged the
Gamms in a intra-house match.
The Gozinvas challenge the
‘Beavers next. Chakras toppled
PIKA, as the ‘Pikers’’ used
both steps 2 and 4 to earn a
place in this column.

SAE, which ended the regular
season on a hot streak, should
shoot past- the SOB’s and
Chakras into the final eight.

Phi Delt ‘‘A’’ should prevail
in what looks like a weak
grouping. The only hope for the
Starfudgers (sorry, guys, but
my mom reads the column) is
that their bats become as of-
fensive as their name.

The next grouping features a
classic battle between the Sum-
mer Richards and the Bongs, a
tribute to Bowie’s scheduling
mastery.

Only the addition of
Ockham’s Razor would make
this division more complete as
the battling blades would be the
logical choice to castrate the
playoff hopes of the Richards
and Bongs.

But, alas, the other teams in
this division are the SPE’s and
Pency Prep, with the SPE’s
causing: the most problems.
(Read whatever you can into
that.)

The Kerwood Derbies should
emerge from the next grouping.
by defeating C-II in the first

game and defeating the winner
of Snow White, Etc. in the
second. The next grouping
features defending champs KA

#2 who should advance by rib-

bing Chocolate Speedway, and
topping the winner of RII- Pen-
thouse.

The final grouping contains
pre-season favorite IFT, who
should first asphyxiate ATO #1,
and then either pulverize Pax or
expunge Emanon.

Turning to volleyball, Banta
and Edmonds must adhere to
title nine even if Scottie Nichols
has immunity.

The only girls IMAC team
worth writing about is The
Clinic, a rowdy bunch of girl
basketball players. The team
is led by ‘Catfish’? Morton,
““Chuck”’ Matheny, because the
toughest kid on any block is
always named Chuck, and
“Sally G” Bondurant.

Look for The Clinic to vac-
cuum out their opponents and
abort their hopes for an IMAC
crown.

The final eight in TMAC
volleyball should be the Gam-
ms, SPE’s. Perkins ‘‘A’’, SIF’s.
Emanon 2. Ockham’s Razor,
SAE, and IFT. The only real
surprise here are the SAE’s.

first round. The Thi’s are still
the favorites. with the SIF’s.
SPE’s, and Derhbies most likely
to pull off an upset.

In accordance with our new
policy of including mediocre
teams in this column, we have
decided to highlight one of the

stitutions” at Davidson; Pency
Prep, ‘‘You’ve probably heard
of it.”’

As Bill Green asserted in his
letter to the Davidsonian, the
Prep’s basic philosophy is not to
win but to have fun. ‘‘Since 1888
we have been molding boys into
splendid, clear-thinking young
men,”’

A team with as much

tradition as Pencey Prep must |

have its stars. Pencey’s most
well known personalities are
Robert Ackley, Stradlater, and
Holden Caulfield, the catcher.

The ‘‘winning at all costs’
jock attitude is not inherent at
Pencey; instead it is the an-
tithesis of Pencey’s. As
Caulfield states ‘‘all the athletic
bastards stick together.’’ But,
recently, the jock ideals have
been making inroads at Pencey.

Bill Green’s letter last week
was not characteristic of a
‘“‘plav for fun’ philosophy. but
was’ characteristic of a
frustrated IMAC loser. who
takes each IMAC decision
seriously.

In refutation of this
dangerous philosophy.
Caulfield retorts ‘‘...vou were

supposed to commit suicide or
something if Pencey didn’t
win,”’

All IMAC fans hope that this
remains the minority view on
Pencev’s participation, for if
this philosophy. should prevail,
it is doubtful that Pencey Prep
would survive the first one or
two flickerball games, and
Davidson would be deprived of
its most colorful. if least ef-
fective team.
