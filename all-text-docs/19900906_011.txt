A Freshman Guide to Orientation

By KATE DUNLOP

No matter how much mental
preparation one has done, nobody
can be fully prepared for the initial
shock. Suddenly you are thrust onto
the other side of the admissions
process. All of those glossy pic-
tures from the catalog that were so
carefully selected are suddenly ani-
mated and moving. The smiling
faces of the other incoming fresh-
men are finally personified.

I wasterrified and excited when
I first stepped on the Davidson
campus for the first day of my
freshman year. Coming from Cali-
fornia, I had not had the chance to
visit the college extensively. My

decision to come to Davidson was
based primarily on catalog reading
combined with basic instinct.
Therefore, I had a lot riding on
Freshman Orientation, the three
days before classes designed to
give new students a better sense of
the Davidson community.

The basic schedule for Orien-
tation had freshmen checking in
all day on Friday,.and then going
from meeting to meeting on Satur-
day, Sunday. and. Monday. the
topics of discussion ranged from
“the Honor Code” to “Living with
our Diversity” to the. “Code of
Responsibility”. there were numer-

ous comments on both the length’

and the redundancy of the presen-
tations.

Freshman Ashley Torrence
suggested: “I think the. presenta-
tions could have been cut down to
allow freshmen to begin to get to
know each other. We should have
been allowed more free time.”

Freshman Becca Peters added:
“Maybe we could have broken ran-
domly into small groups for differ-
ent discussions. We spent a lot of

‘lime with our halls, but not with

the other students.” The most
prevalent comment concerned the
repetitive nature of the Honor Code
presentation. “The Honor Code is
a very important part of the
Davidson experience, but I think
people understood that before they
came here. The presentation was
necessary, but the repetition

wasn’t” commented Peters.

Not all of the presentations
were written off by the students,
however. Dean Terry’s speech on
Saturday before the- parents left
was appreciated. Freshman Meg
Kendall noted that Terry “painted
a realistic picture of what college
life will be like. We will have our
good days and our bad. The adjust-
ment will be difficult; not every-
thing is going to be easy. It kind of
scared me, but it was important.”

As I see it, Freshman Orienta-
tion lasts until the freshmen are
allowed on Patterson Court on Sep-
tember 20. Although there was
criticism over the initial three days
of orientation, freshmen generally
applaud the decision not to allow

freshmen to attend fraternity and

eating house parties until that date.

“It gives us achance to getto know

our class. Mixers are a good idea,”
said. Susan Beales,a freshman.
Beales’ only suggestion is “I think
we need to start mixing with the
other girls halls. It’s great to hang

out with people on your hall, but
it’s also important to meet as many
students as you can.” Slowly, as
freshmen become adjusted to life
at Davidson, the memories of
Freshmen Orientation will fade.

Challenging classes and meeting

new friends is what takes up most

of our time now. Nevertheless,

Freshman Orientation was an

important part of our initial accli-

mation to Davidson.
