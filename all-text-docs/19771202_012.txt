Wildcat wrestlers
open new season

By ARTHUR A. NONIMUS
Staff Writer

The wrestling team is opti-
mistic about the upcoming
season as they return seven of
last year’s starters and peren-
nial Head Coach Charles
Parker, who has been sorely
missed the last two years.

In addition, many new
freshmen and sophomore
wrestlers will add to the depth
of the team.

This year’s team will be
paced by senior captain Glenn
Ballard, juniors Pat Dulany
and Scott Phillips, and soph-
omore Rob King. Other
possible standouts include

juniors Pete Johnson and Ste-
ven Sellers, sophomores Mike
Garfinkel and Anthony Sanfil-
ipo, and freshmen Pat McKin-
sey and Eric Reintsema.

Newcomers that could see
considerable action are Bill
Allen, Kevin Calderbank, Rich
Giech, Dave Rew and Chuck

The grapplers open their
season at Catawba on Tues-
day, December 6, and wrestle
in an invitational tournament
on the following Saturday.

After Christmas, the wres-,
tling team will host Elon
College and the Citadel in their
first home appearance on Sa-
turday, January 14.

A strong second half surge
was insturmental in allowing
the Davidson basketball team
to enjoy its second consecutive
victory of the year by defea-
ting a stubborn Erskine squad
90-74.

Early in the game, the

) Wildcats’ defense seemed to

have difficulty coping with the
deliberate offense which Ers-
kine employed.

The Flying Fleet used their

’ front line effectively in con-
? trolling play throughout most

of the first half.

in a total of 23 first half

jumpers which continually
frustrated the Erskine team.

The Cats seemed to pick
their game up whem Coach
Pritchett inserted sophmores
Ernie Reigel and Tim Bowker
for defensive purposes.

Both players responded ex-
tremely well playing tenacious
defense (Reigel with 7 re-
bounds, Bowker with 4
blocked shots) which had the
added effect of livening up the
offense.

Davidson began to pull
ahead in the second half as
Gerdy and freshman point
guard Chris Dodds began to
combine effectively to capita-
lize on the large number of
turnovers which the revival
defense began to produce.

Dodds in particular scored
almost, at will after halftime,
weaving through the Erskine
defense after receiving many
fine outlet passes trom his

teammates.
Much of the credit for the

victory must be directed to
Coach Pritchett for instituting
a half court zone trap with
about twelve minutes to play.
Pritchett normally utilizes
such a defense much later in a
‘game, but felt that it might
serve to confuse Erskine’s
patterned style of play.

His coaching move paid off
well as the opposition rapidly
became very disorganized, and
the Wildcats put the game on
ice with a successful fast break
offense.

This. weekend Davidson
hosts the Charlotte Invita-
tional Basketball Tournament
at the Coliseum. The Wildcats

the finals against the winner of
the Colgate-Illinois St. game.

Illinois St., a probable fi-
nalist seems likely to pose a
strong threat with a powerful.
lineup including a seven-foot
sophomore center.
