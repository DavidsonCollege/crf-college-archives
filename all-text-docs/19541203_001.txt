Blood Drive To Be
Held On Dec. 7, 8

The Davidson College Blood
Drive will be held in the basement
of Johnston Gymnasium on Tues-
day and Wednesday, December 7
and 6.

Sponsored by Scabbard and
Blade, the drive is open to towns-
people, faculty members, and stu-
dents. Donations may be made be-
tween the hours of 11:00 a. m.
and 5:00 p. m. either day.

Students under 21 must have the
permission of their parents be-
fore they will be allowed to give
blood. The College has mailed re-
leases to all parents, and approxi-
mately 200 have been returned. A
list of students for whom releases
have been received will be posted
in the ROTC Building and in the
College Union.

Other students under 21 who
desire to give blood are asked to
have their parents sign the releas-
es as soon as possible and mail
them to the College.

The need for blood is today
greater than ever. The Davidson
Community alone has used 65
pints of blood from the Red Cross
facilities. This blood supplied by
the Red Cross is free of charge.

The need for blood in the Char-
lotte area is also very critical, as
more than 900 pints are used each
month in Mecklenburg County.

GAVELS, DRAPERIES DOMINATE

Eumanean Axes Fall

BY NOSMO KING

“Dame Guillotine’ enjoyed an evening of promiscuous
decapitation in the stronghold of the ,Woodrow-Wilson-and-
Women Worshippers Monday night at 8:15 as president T. (for
Tom) Cooper clubbed (for want of a gavel) the third meeting
of the Eumenean Literary Society to order. The roll call was
accompanied by considerable weeping, wailing, and so forth,
as the illustrious names of many worthies began to be strick-
en from the lists, because of failure on the part of the be-
wailed to comply with the minimum attendance requirements,
to wit, attend once every three meetings (the alternative: be

on friendly terms with the secretary).

However, the occlusion of the
elements being taken into consid-
eration, the presidential inference
was that a reconsideration of mem-
berships for the excummunicated
was in the offing. The possibility
of such a collective pardon was
greeted with mixed emotion from
the assembly, but no proceedures

Christmas Parties
Scheduled Dec. 13

On Monday night, December 13,
the Inter-Fraternity Council is
sponsoring the annual Christmas
parties for the Barium Springs
Orphanage. Twelve groups of chil-
dren ranging from six to thirteen
years of age will visit the frater-
nity houses.

After arriving at 7:15, the chil-
dren will be given a short pro-
gram of Christmas music by the
Male Chorus. Each fraternity will
then entertain one group of chil-
dren at its house. Presents will be
delivered by Santa Claus, who will
go from house to house.

The Superintendent of Barium

. | Springs remarked that the children
;|have two goals in life: one is to

go to Heaven and the other is to
come to Davidson. And if they had
to choose, he didn’t know which
they would take.

DAVIDSONIAN EDITS

Johnston Sends Vance Papers To Printers

Raleigh—Copy for the first vol-
ume of the Zebulon Vance papers,
to be published by the State De-
partment of Archives and History,
has gone to the printer, it was an-
nounced November 27 by Dr. Chris-
topher Crittenden, director. In
ceremonies held in the office of D.
L. Corbitt, head of the depart-
ment’s publications division, the
typescript was turned over to L. B.
Phillips, director of the State Col-
lege print shop, which will do the
job. Delivery is expected next
spring or summer.

The series is being directed by
Dr. Frontis W. Johnston, head of
the history department of Davidson
College, who is also writing a
biography of Vance. It will cover
Vance’s career to the end of 1662,
when he had been governor four
months and when North Carolina
had been in the southern Confed-
eracy a little more than a year and
a half. Seven or eight volumes are
planned.

As editor, Dr. Johnston has had

to deal with some 15,000 individu-
al manuscripts, most of which are
in the department’s archives.
Roughly one-half of these appear
to merit publication.

A native of Buncombe County,
Vance served as congressman, gov-
ernor, and United States senator.
He is one of two Tar Heels whose
busts are in Statuary Hall in the
nation’s Capitol. The other is
Charles B. Aycock.

Leading scholars have called the
department’s publication program
the best of any state in the Union.
To date the department has pub-
lished a total of over three hun-
dred and forty items, of which
more than forty are volumes of
documents. Among these have been
the Records of the Moravians in
North Carolina, and separated se-
ries containing the papers of such
leading North Carolinians as Thom-
as Ruffin, John Steele, Jonathan
Worth, Willis P. Mangum and Ar-
chibald D. Murphey.

Monkey Business

There being a quorum present,
Eumenean proceeded with its busi-
ness, old and new. Right Wing Ex-
tremist T. Dove nominated and suc-
cessfully backed W. Duke to the
chairmanship of the Committee for
Restoration of Draperies, and T.
Morgan (he, too, a Right Wing End
Man) furthered Duke's conquests

by nominating and assisting him];

pointing them to their respective

Other business of equal import
included a unanimous vote of ac-
ceptance of J. Canarroe’s gift of
a gavel, with the engraving: “From
Mother,” and the financial report.
New treasurer, A. “Midas,” Dick,

‘foretold brimming coffers in the

Ghosts—Not ibsen’s

Mr. vice-president Crouse pre-

Holty Talks

Lecturer Sponsored
By D.C. Artist Series

Friday night at 8:15 Mr. Carl
Holty, one of the outstanding
American painters and lecturers
of today, will be heard at David.
son College. The Artist Series Com-
mittee is happy to announce this
extra attraction in its program.
Blanche Thebom’s appearance at
Davidson, scheduled for the night
of December 3, has been changed
to May 6, 1955, due to an im-
portant dress-rehearsal of the
Metropolitan Opera’s production
of “Salome.” Mr. Holty’s lecture
will be free to Season Ticket hold-
ers and general admission to all
others will be $1.00.

Few artists have a background
as varied as that of Carl Holty,
who is appearing under the aus-
pices of the Arts Program, Asso-
ciation of American Colleges. At
an early age he drew with ambi-
tion for perspective. He studied at
Milwaukee Art School, Chicago Art
Institute, and the National Acad-
emy of Design in New York. A
well-known portrait painter at 23,
Mr. Holty went to Europe where
he studied at the Royal Academy
and Hofman School in Munich for
two years. His work was exhibit-
ed in Paris for three years, and
he was represented in important
collections in Munich.

Robinson Tells AED
Of Medical Trends

Dr. C. W. Robinson, general
practitioner in Charlotte, spoke
Wednesday night to Alpha Epsi-
lon Delta about trends in medical
practice and recent progress in
medicine. His address was given at
the pre-medical honorary frater-
nity’s first December meeting.

Dr. Robinson told the young pre-
meds that closer associations with
patients and a chante to study
real medicine are advantages in
general practice that are beginning
a trend in medicine, a trend away
from specialized fields.

The medical schools are going
along with this trend and in re-
cent years have instituted special
General Practice courses for the
men who desire to enter that field.
Preceptorships, gaining practical
experience while still in medical
school, have recently come to the
front in better medical circles.

He also said that another trend
today is the establishment of clin.
ies in urban and rural communi-
ties. Many young men just getting
out of school are finding this an
ideal plan. Several doctors pool
their resources and gain, in sever-
al years, the advantages they would
otherwise be striving for until
they were far advanced in age.

Through this pool of resources
they are able to combine their
several abilities and render better
service to their patients. These
clinics usually contain expensive
laboratory equipment and supplies
that would be otherwise unobtain-
able if their resources were not
pooled,

Moreover, Dr. Robinson sees ad-
vantages in the rural communities
where. these clinics may contain
beds for those patients who can-
not be hospitalized elsewhere.

Dr. Robinson continued by say- '-

ing that medicine today is a far
cry from the medicine of years
past. As an illustration he com-
mented on the dependence of a
physician on a good technician. X-
ray is a comparatively new inno-
vation that has completely changed
the concept of medicine, and the

Our money will buy seed, farm-
ing supplements and materials for
developing various projects. These
funds will be administered by the
church teams working in the area.
These teams live in the villages
with the people and demonstrate
to them advanced methods of agri-
culture, sanitation techniques and
methods of home canning and pre-
serving.

Mr. Harley Kline who worked
with these teams for three years
and was director this past year,
will be on campus next week to
tell us more of the work in this
area,

Two solicitors have been ap-
pointed for each hall and every
student will be contacted § in-
dividually. Contributions may be
made directly to the solicitor or
if a student so desires, he may
pledge the amount of his contribu-
tion and pay it after Christmas.
All pledges will be due by Janu-
ary 12.

The goal of $4000 is important
but more important is 100% par-
ticipation by the student body.
It is sometimes easy to over-
look the problems of a people who
are so far removed from us and
to see only our own problems here
at home. However, these problems
exist and are acute. This is an
opportunity for us to share our
plenty with a people who have
not been so fortunate as we.

Displays showing the work in
this area will be placed in the
Union next week.
