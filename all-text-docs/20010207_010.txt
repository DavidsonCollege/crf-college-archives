Inexplicable. f

With just over five minutes remaining on
Monday night, the Lady Wildcats found them-
selves knotted in a three-point game against
UNC Greensboro at Belk Arena.

Yes, those Wildcats. The same team that
lost to Greensboro by 39 points less than a
month ago. The same team that suffered a 31-
point defeat at the hands of Western Carolina
on Saturday, hand-
ing the lowly Cata-
ae mounts their first

\ 6 0 home victory of the
season. The same

ae depleted, injury-
ridden. Wildcats who had five scholarship
players at the gym but out of uniform on
Monday night.

And yes, the same UNC Greensboro team
that has won 12 of its 13 conference games by
an average of almost 20 points each.

Yet somehow, some way, these two squads
went the full 15 rounds on Monday night
before Greensboro pulled away at the end,
escaping Belk Arena with a 72-60 victory.

“Today was about us growing up as a
team,” said head coach John Filar. “We were
all upset with our performance on Saturday
(at Western Carolina) because that was a big
game for us. This was a gut check.”

And—at least for 35 minutes—his team
responded.

Kelly Copland led the way with 20 points,
nine rebounds, four assists and three blocks.

“Kelly was a workhorse tonight,” Filar
said. “She did it at both ends of the floor. She

. defended Brianne Dodgen; she blocked shots,
she grabbed rebounds, she ran the break, she-

hit her free throws. She did it all.”

Janna Magette played a full 40 minutes,
and turned in 17 points and four assists. Kim
Taylor added 12 points and nine boards.

But the feel-good story of the night had to’

be the second-half heroics of Lindsay Shade,
a 5-4 freshman guard from the Marist School
in Atlanta. _

Shade, one of several guards competing for
playing time so far this season, came off the
bench in the second half to drill three-point-
ers on back-to-back possessions, cutting
Greensboro’s lead to three and injecting a
shot of adrenaline into the squad.

“It’s so rewarding as a coach to see some-

body work as hard as she has in practice, and
then come into a close game with so much on
the line and lift her team up like that,” said
Filar. “Seeing Kelly Copland and Janna
Magette exploding in celebration around
her....that was special.”
Teammates, though, were just as impressed
with Shade’s defensive effort: the Wildcats’
#4 helped shut down ChoRhonda Gwaltney—
among the league’s quickest guards—during
the second half, holding the 5-6 Spartan guard
silent and scoreless. “Lindsay played tre-
mendous defense,” said Robyn Flewelling.
“Her helping to hold Gwaltney scoreless in
the second half was just as important to us as
the three-pointers she hit.”

“Tt was a feel good night,” said Copland.
“Our team really came together. After
Saturday’s loss, we came back and began to
question whether or not we had it in us.
Tonight just reminds us that we can play with
anybody.”

Kelly Copland defends during Monday’s game against UNC Greens-
boro. The junior forward scored 20 points with nine rebounds, four

assists and three blocks, but UNCG won the game 72-60. Less than
one month ago, the Lady Wildcats lost to the Spartans by 39 points.

Akin leads new crop of pitchers

By JENN: HIGGINS
Staff Writer

Brian Akin loves baseball so much that he
can’t even watch it. He doesn’t go to games.
He doesn’t watch the World Series. He
doesn’t even have a baseball idol like Roger
Clemens or Pedro Martinez.

Seems odd, but then again. Akin isn’t your
average Louisville Slugger.

Growing up in Louisville, Ky., baseball
wasn’t the only thing in Akin’s life. Like
most athletes, he played other sports while
attending high school at duPont Manual.

He perfected his putting on the golf course
during the fall and adapted his jump shot on
the basketball court in the winter.

But the spring and the summer belonged to
baseball.

By the time he began his senior season of
baseball, he had already applied to Duke,
Wake Forest, Washington & Lee, the Uni-
versity of Richmond and‘Davidson, all with-
out being recruited.

Akin’s high school coach saw his potential
and contacted Davidson coach Dick Cooke.

Cooke was-willing to take a look at the
pitcher, as much for his academic successes
as baseball.

“Tt was very important to us that Brian
wanted to come here for academic reasons,
long before we became interested in recruit-
ing him as a baseball player,” Cooke said.

“Davidson has an excellent reputation
among liberal arts colleges, so to attract
players who are truly dedicated, but care
about more than just playing baseball, makes
this a unique environment.”

Akin, a prospective Chemistry major; says

he is interested in following in his father’s

footsteps to pursue a career in medicine. He
is a resident of Basement Rich and confesses
his favorite Commons meal to be chicken
parmesan.

“I really love it here,” said Akin. 1. “Playing

baseball is just an added bonus to already
great experience.” “Something that I believe
is unique to Davidson is the fact that every-
one is of the same mentality—that school
comes first,” says Akin. “There really are no
egos on the team. There is only a group of
guys whoare
playing sim-
ply because
they love the
game.”

For Akin,
adjusting to
playing at the
Division I
level has
been a pretty
smooth tran-
sition. He is
a candidate
for a spot in
the starting
rotation.

As for Akin, at 6’3" and 185 pounds, he is
an imposing force on the mound. “Brian has
good physical size for a pitcher at this level,”
noted Cooke. “He has what baseball people
call ‘projectability’.” Along with that

‘projectability’, Brian has a ‘consistent ve-
locity’ and ‘probably the best curve ball on
the team’, according to Cooke.

With 15 pitchers listed on the team roster
(and only 13 who are capable of pitching),
Akin could have the opportunity to see play-
ing time in all 54 games.

His bio isn’t full of awards he’s won
throughout his pre-college career.'Or even

Sp
Brian Akin

. records he’s broken at his alma mater. He

doesn’t come from a family full of baseball
players (his older brother plays tennis ‘at
Centre College). And he even admits he still
needs work on his change-up. He is a genu-
ine guy who has always just played baseball
because he likes to play baseball. And he
happens to be pretty good at it too.
