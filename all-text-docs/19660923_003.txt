EAST EUROPEAN VARIETY

3rd Communism Propounded

By AL VARNER
Staff Writer

“The Third Communism”
which exists today in the coun-
tries of Eastern Europe was
the subject of Tuesday's chapel
speaker, Leopold Tyrmand.

Tyrmard, a native of Poland,
is visiting this country in con-
nection with the U.S. State
Department. The “Third Com-
munism” which he described
was one very different from
those currently existing in the
Soviet Union and Red China.

According to Tyrmand, this
communism is based on a dif-
ferent set of values than those
of the Russians or Red Chin-

tions against this communism
have occurred.

ese. These values seem to be
more Western in their nature

than the coldly idealistic val- Another characteristic of
ues upon which the other two- this particular brand of com
communisms are based. munism is that the people

under it have been conditioned
to accept it. An example he
used here was that there is no
Siberia in Eastern Europe be-
cause the people have adjust-
ed to the system so well.
Finally, Tyrmand noted that
there is no basic distrust in
the individual who lives in this
“Third Communism”. While
the Russians are extremely
unbelieving and will even go
to great ends to imagine
schemes. against them, the

For example, Tyrmand said
that people in Eastern Europe
talked about a man who has
been ‘‘deported’’ by the secret
police while people in Russia
would not even discuss the
man after his disappearance.

Also, Tyrmand said that this
“Third Communism’ could be
distinguished by several char-
acteristics. The first of these
is that it was established with-
out a _ military revolution,
though several small revolu-

East Europeans will accept
improbable situations if they
are affirmed by a reasonably
reliable source.

Tyrmand's example concern

Russians who wouldn't be
lieve that American workers
owned their own cars. Even
when they were told to ask the
workers themselves, the Rus-
sians said that the workers
would certainly lie to keep up
the “obvious” ruse.

On the other hand, Tyrmand
said that East Europeans
might question the ownership
of the cars once, but they

would accept it as fact when

they were reassured it was
true.
Tyrmand, himself, is very

interesting im that he is a jour-
nalist, author, and jazz enthus
iast, and has even worked with
the Polish Red Cross and as
a staff member of an influen
tial Catholic weekiy in East

Europe. ‘He has written sey-
eral novels and short stories
and his latest novel, High So-
ciety and Sentimental Life,
was banned from East Europe
for political reasons and will
soon be published in America.

Out Of Mail Boxes

have run out. °

Upperclassmen who failed to
renew their boxes last year have
lost out entirely, and freshmen
were able to get boxes only by
doubling up.

Plans have been made for the
addition of 600 boxes by the be-
ginning of second semester. Post
master W. B. Mayhew says he
expects this to be adequate for
another five years if the com-
munity continues to grow at its
present rate.

Last year Davidson became a
first class post office district,
because of the amount of reve-
nue taken in during the preced-
ing year. Last year the amount
was barely reached again, and
the first class rating was re
tained.

Applicants who were accepted
at Davidson last spring but ulti
matdly chose another school
have indicated ‘‘no earth-shak
ing reasons” for their decision,
according to H. Edmunds White,
director of admissions.

White reported this week that
the results of questionnaires re-
cently sent to boys who rejected
Davidson showed that no speci-
fic factor of the College was the
cause.

Over 80 per cent of the some
190 applicants who went else-
where answered the question-
naire, which was prompted in
part by a slight drop in this
year’s enrollment of accepted
applicants.

The questionnaire was divided
into two parts. The freshmen
were asked to evaluate, using a
uniform scale, 19 factors for
both Davidson and the school
they eventually chose.

The factors fell into
general categories:

The admissions procedure,
including date school sent ac
ceptance letter, contact with
college representatives and_cor-
respondence from admissions of-
fice.

cluding students’ personalities,

tudes about their school.
~The school itself-its size,

environment, faculty, programs
and religious affiliation, if any.

The results indicated that a
majority were impressed with
Davidson, he said. “‘A few were
quite critical, but these were
not. consistent. We found no con
sistent low rating in any factor
we could change.”

The survey also showed that
the boys who spurned Davidson
are now in schools that are
“among the best in the country

like Princeton, Harvard, Duke
and Sewanee.”
