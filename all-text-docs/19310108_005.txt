New Vork_-(IP)—That an occasional
riot in the public would be a good manner
of attracting money to the college is the be-
lief of the Bulletin, undergraduate publica-
tion of Barnard College for Women here.

“If we, by bursting the bonds of conven-
tion, can gain a little profitable publicity,”
the Bulletin said, “let us imitate the noble
example our brothers have set for us... .
Let us. be Amazons, oh my sisters! Let us

Wesleyais Planning
On Changing Name

Middletown, Conn.—Agitation has been
; renewed this year on the Wesleyan Univer-
sity campus to have the name of the uni-
versity changed.

For some time now the change of name
has been the subject of much discussion here,
the chief reason for the proposed change
being that the institution is so frequently
mistaken for Wesleyans in other parts of the
country, such as West Virginia Wesleyan,
Ohio Wesleyan, and several others in the
mid-west. :

It is also declared on the campus here that
the name indicates a closer connection with
the Methodist Church — than
warranted.

Episcopal is

This year the university is finding it dif-|

jficult to gain any publicity outside of the
New England and Atlantic Coast states, be

cause of the feeling on the part of newspa- |

per editors that the Eastern institution's
name will be applied by readers to Wes-

leyans in their own territory.

test for short-story writers of colleges and
universities. The magazine is offering a
| prize of $1,000 for the best and $500 for the
next best short story.

men and women students who are under-
graduates of American colleges during, the

The Ladies’ Home Journal thinks that a
large number of college men and women
have undiscovered talent. The magazine is
so firm in its belief that it is going to award
these attractive cash prizes.

The subject is not limited to any  partic-
lular phase of life, section of the country or
lelass of people; however, it is natural to
suppose that the author would be more suc-
cessful with material of which he had first-
hand knowledge.

ruary 1, in the short, short story contest,
The prize short, short story will appear in
the June number of the magazine. It is

Davidson Five and
Ten Years Ago

———__Y

Five—Many interesting things were found
in the first January issue of the Davidsonian
of 1926. A front page article told of the
decision of the faculty to henceforth bar all
intercollegiate boxing meets. The Wildcats
opened their basketball season by defeating
the strong Duke five, 32 to 31. However, the
following night the Red Terrors of N. C.
State downed the Davidson boys to the tune
of 32 to 24. In these two games Huie and
Captain Flake Laird were the outstanding
Davidson players. Laird was high scorer for
the season at that point. The Davidson ora-
tors planned a very ambitious schedule, meet-
ing Wake. Forest, U. of Pittsburgh, William
and Mary, Presbyterian College, U. of the
South at Sewannee.

Ten—Davidson was in the midst of the
famous million dollar campaign in 1920, The
students of the college had pledged them-
selves to raise $10,000. The Rockefeller

| Foundation offered to give Davidson $100,-

000 if the college would raise the other
$400,000. The Sophomore showed
marked superiority in winning the inter-class
basketball tournament. Mr. Fred Hengeveld
had just taken over the job of basketball
coach. A kind letter of appreciation had just
been received from President Woodrow Wil-
son in regard to the endowment of the
Woodrow Wilson Chair of Ecogomics and
Political Science at Davidson.

Freshmen Downed

By Salisbury Hi.

A zone system of defense which proved
very effective marked the victory of the Salis-
bury High quintet over the Davidson Fresh-
men team in a game played at Davidson, De-
cember 16. When the final whistle blew the
Salisbury crew were out in front by a score
of 16 to 11.

Davidson took a first quartert lead of 4 to
2, but by half-time Salisbury had found the
range and from that point on was never

headed.

Chase, Salisbury, was high scorer of the
game, making his shots good for eight of his
team’s counters, while Evans and Rowan led
the Freshmen scoring with four points each,
Evans played a brilliant game at forward
while Morris of Davidson proved himself
effective at guard.
