YMCA Opens Fund Drive
For Expanded Programs

To support its greatly expanded and revised pro-
gram the YMCA today launches its annual finance cam-
paign among students and faculty.

In order to present the stud-
ent with “the problems and is-
sues our generation must face”
and “provide him with an op-
portunity for a sincere expres-
sion of Christian faith" the
YMCA plans to present a new
and varied program for the
year, explains YMCA President
Joe Howell.

‘ In its finance drive to be held
this weekend and in the first
part of next week the YMCA
hopes to raise $4500. Howell
states “I am confident that the
students will come through
when they see the quality of
programs that is available to
them.”

Howell released the following
tentative set of speakers for the
Great Issues of Our Time For-
ums:

On Oct. 4 Dr. Geza Grossch-
mid, director of the African Af-
fairs Institute at Dusquesne Uni-
versity. will kick off the first
semester series on the emerging
nations in Africa.

On Oct. 14 chapel speaker
on “South African Predica-
ment” will be Stewart King,
journalist for the Charleston
News and Courier.

On Oct. 17, “Africa in World
Politics” will be the subject of
an evening talk by Dr. Vernon
McKay, professor of African
studies at the School of Advanc-
‘ed International Studies of
Johns Hopkins University.

The national chairman of the
Zimbabwe African Peoples
Union which. is the moderate
party of Southern Rhodesia,
Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole, will
‘speak on “African Nationalism
Today” on Oct. 31.

The topic on Nov. 4 is
“Role of Religion in Emerg-
ing Africa,” presented by Da-
vid W. Robinson, a Davidson
graduate of 1960. He was
valedictorian and a member
of Phi Beta Kappa and Omi-
cron Delta Kappa. Robinson,
who has spent the last two
years in Daker, Senagal, took
graduate work at Union
Theological Seminary in New
York.

These forums provide the
spearhead for the YMCA’s pro-
gram of the year. In addition it

plans to continue previous pro-

grams and institute still others.
The quality of the programs and
the new activities will require
an increase in the organization's
budget.

Freshmen will be contacted by
their respective hall counselors
about contributing to the drive.
Upper classmen wil! be ap-
proached by solicitors coming
to them in their dormitory
rooms and elsewhere. Both the
hall counselors and the solici-
tors will discuss the YMCA’s
program and answer any ques-
tions the students might have.

mp “ a

Deputations will continue to
go to do work in Mooresville,
to teach Sunday school, and to
provide fellowship speakers.
In the area of community
work there will be opportuni-
ties for students to help in
coaching children’s football
and basketball teams, to assist
Scouting units and to work
among the Negro community.

Persons interested in helping
in deputation and coaching work
will be notified of opportunities
by notices on the Union bulletin
board and in the announcement
forms given out in chapel.

The YMCA also hopes to have
several discussion forums utiliz-
ing the Richardson Scholars on
campus. Panels on other sub-
jects such as the race issue and
sex will be conducted by stud-
ents.

An increase in the number of
programs on “Challenges in
Christian Life” is planned. To
date, programs have beep ar-
ranged on the challenges from
psychology, the natural sciences,
philosophy and secularization in

the modern church.

A pamphiet is being distri-
buted to all students during
the financial drive answering
questions on the activities of
the YMCA and conteining e
detailed budget for the com-
ing year.

As a service to individual
spiritual needs the YMCA plans
to organize hall prayer meetings,
special vesper services, volun-
tary chapels and a devotional
booklet.

Second semester the forum
series will be on the “Problems
of The Changing South.” Five
to 5ix speakers will headline
this series.

Don't forget about the croquet
match.

These are the grammar schools,

For the upperclassmen the

picks freshmen roommates.

Of course, with such a large

Faculty Toughens Concept
Of Academic Probation

Josh White Returns

BY JOHNNY CLARK

Important changes in the definition of “Academic
Probation” and in the rules governing traffic violations
were among several amendments to the college regula-|
tions that were adopted recently by the faculty.

Beginning with the first grade
report this semester, any stud-
ent who fails to earn grades
representing at least 12 semes-
ter hours and nine quality points
will be placed on academic pro-
bation until the end of the se-
mester,

Formerly the minimum = re-
quirement was nine semester
hours and six quality points;
however, according to Dean of
Students Richard C. Burts, a
number of faculty
were disturbed over the dis-
erepancies in. the requirements
for academic probation and the
requirements for admittance to
a rising class.

Fonmerly a freshman. for in-
stance, could be denied admit-
tance to the sophomore class
without having ever been placed
on academic probation. That is,
a student could earn 18 semester
hours and. 12 quality points dur-
ing his freshman year and still
be kept out of the sophomore
class, since 24 semester hours
and 18 quality points are requir-
ed for entrance into the sopho-
more year.

Under the new rule, a stud-
ent cannot be taken off aca-
demic probation during a
semester. Dean Burts explain-
ed that mid-semester grades
ere not a true indication of
the student’s work since they
are usually based on only one
review. Also, when a student
was removed from “AP” at
mid-semester, he tended to
become lackadaisical and find
himself in worse trouble at
the end of the semester.

“In other words, mid-semester
is not a give-and-take situation
any more,’ Dean Burts _ said.
“We can place a student on pro-
bation at mid-semester, but we
cannot take him off.”

In other changes, the maxi-
mum speed limit on campus has
been changed from 25 to 20
miles per hour, “with lower
speeds at turns and intersec-
tions.” Parking permit holders

should consult the current Wild- |

cat Handbook concerning other
changes in the traffic regula-
tions.

Not only must a student sat-
isfy any financial obligations to
the college before gzaduation,

taken, all that had read il
agreed that it was an improve:
ment over previous years.

The group talked over the
question of evening dormitory
activity with the hope that
something would be made defin-
ite in the near future which
would make things quieter for
boys studying in their rooms at
night.

A suggestion was, made that
the council compile information
concerning the various courses
offered and include student
viewpoints on the courses by

shoulders and laughs when ask-
ed about a system.

“Oh, no, I just use intuition,”
she says. She usually starts by
reading each student's file and
the questionnaire that he filled
out on his personal living habits.
The chief defect in this, she
feels, “is that personality docs-
n't come through on paper.”

Then when she has a mental
poop sheet on each student, she
takes the pre-med blanks and
puts them in one stack. Putting
pre-meds together usually avoids
the trouble of conflict of study
hours since pre-meds generally
have labs in the afternoon. This

roommace doesn't study in the
afternoon and disturb the other
all night.

With the other boys she trys
to match interests and genera}
room habits. She seldom puts
two athletes of better than aver-
age ability together, “especially
if they compete in the same
sport.” However, she states,
“Teammates often pick each
other as roommates in their
sophomore year.”

When asked if exchange stud-
ents were problems, she chuck-
led, “Oh no, I always have more
requests for foreign students
than I can fill.”

Do boys that ask to room to-
gether ever pose many prob-
lems? Sometimes yes, some-
times no, it just depends. Mrs.
Moore feels that it is better not
to room with a boy “who just
happens to be from the same
town.” She explains it this way,
“The boy from home is probably
already a friend. Why not make
another friend with a new room-
mate?”

What about problem room-
mates? The boy who is a prob-
lem roommate usually has as his
main fault thoughtlessness.
“This thoughtlessness,” opines
Mrs. Moore, “is the cause of
most of the trouble in the dorm.
Boys just must learn to respect

the rights of others to study.”

In dealing with upperclass-
men, what difference do frater-
nities make? Most of the time
boys from the same fraternity
prefer to room together. But
Mrs. Moore’s classic example
that this is not a dogmatic rule
is of two boys who were to-
gether their freshman year and
joined different fraternities.
They stayed together for four
years and each was president of
his fraternity his senior year.

On advice to freshmen about
dorm life, Mrs. Moore hesitated
and said, “Well, its hard to...
ah ...4I1 guess just to be
thoughtful of the rights of
others.”
