Much of Savage’s work has
incorporated upholstery into the

sculptural forms, a unique medium -

in sculpture. Savage explained
that he became interested in uphol-
stery after an incident in his apart-
menta couple years ago. Confined
to his apartment for some time due
toan injury, he decided to reuphol-
ster his sofa and discovered he
could use the fabric as a medium
for his art.

Entering the final room of the
show, the observer finds Russ
Warren’s bright, vibrant oil paint-
ings that create a serene setting.
Warren finds that “‘Cort’s work is
demanding as far as space—it’s

sort of boisterous, whereas I see
mine as quiet and contemplative.”

Warren’s exhibit focuses ona
horse motif, as he explains that
horses are a big part of his life. He
found that it is “hard taking cliche
images and working with them,”
but he enjoyed the struggle and the
challenge of “reinventing the
wheel.” Warren expressed that
anything that has become generic
in art, such as a bull or even a
landscape, poses difficulty. War-
ren believes “the tradition can be-
come overwhelming—lI want to
get to the personal nature, a varia-
tion on a theme.”

The division of the show has a
powerful effect, as each room has

ON

a different mood and message.
Warren notes “to make separate
statements was important; the di-
versity might be nice in a differ-
ent show, but in mixing up the art
work the personal statement gets
watered down.” With each artist’s
work in separate rooms, the per-
sonal statements are concentrated
and presented clearly to the ob-
server.

The Davidson art department
encourages students, staff, faculty,
and the community to take a stroll
through the galleries in the Visual
Art Center. The gallery hours are
from 10 to 4 during the week and
from 2 to 5 on the weekend.

'94-95 Artist Series features
jazz and modern dance

By Tammy Tiska

The 1994-95 Artists Series
promises to be one of the most
diverse and exciting yet. The sea-
son kicks off on October 15 witha
performance by the modern dance
group ODC/San Francisco. In its
24th year, the company often danc-
ers has won national acclaim and
rave reviews from such discrimi-

nating critics as The New York

Times.

On December 3, Davidson will
welcome renowned jazz musician
Terrence Blanchard. He has anew
album out ffrom Columbia records
entitled “The Billie Holiday
Songbook,” which is mostly in-
strumental, although it features
vocals by Jeanie Bryson (daughter
of Dizzy Gillespie). Blanchard
also composed the score for Spike
Lee’s film Crooklyn and Matty
Rich’s latest movie The Inkwell.

Spring semester will see the

production of Oleanna on Febru-
ary 21. Written by David Mamet,
Pulitzer Prize-winning author of
Glengarry Glen Ross and Hoffa,
Oleanna explores the current de-
bate on college campuses between
advocates of diversity and defend-
ers of free speech.

The Artists Series closes on
March 16 when Stephen Kayne.
and the British Black Actors
present MacBeth. The play man-
ages to stay true to the original
text, but it is set in contemporary
Africa. It has been praised for its
originality, especially the combi-
nation of European and traditional
African costumes.

Davidson is fortunate to host
such a diverse and accomplished
series of artists. Tickets for all
events are $5 at the door, and sea-
son tickets are $10. They can be
purchased at the Union Ticket Of-
fice, Monday -Friday, 2 to 5 p.m.
