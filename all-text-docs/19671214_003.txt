~e—e-

Davidson put the better basketball team on the
floor Tuesday night and played well enough to win.
They had their troubles, what with missing foul shots
and making turnovers, but a bigger factor in the loss
was the added lift Vanderbilt got by playing in its
home gym, with its home refs and al} its home fans.
All extra opposition was something the ‘Cats
could have done without.

In the first place, Vanderbilt’s team, presently
ranked third in the nation, does pretty well for itself.
In addition, the officiating was as p: an as the spec-
tators, or so it seemed. Johnny Hagen, Vandy’s hotshot
guard, played the last 18 and a half minutes of regula-
tion time and the entire overtime period with four
fouls. Meanwhile he was in several collisions, all called
offensive fouls against Davidson. His care, or the
officials’, paid off when he tossed in the crusher with
:02 left in the game.

Wayne Huckel is still wondering what he did to
deserve the technical foul late in the game. The call
came at a key time in Vanderbilt’s comeback. Cheer-
leaders and Players both tabbed the game as a home-
town ref job. Meanwhile Lefty maintained a very
eloquent silence. .

‘Nearly every Davidson foul shooter found himself
confronted with 11,000 unified voices encouraging him
to choke. The Davidson cheerleaders were man-handled
and kept from getting up to cheer for the Wildcats.
Each time the Wildcats’ cheerleaders would jump up
from their seats to cheer, the Vandy fans in the row
behind them would grab them and shove them back
into their seats. A policeman, asked to intervene, mere-
ly chuckled: “Your fans would do the same thing.”

One policeman had to take a little more active
role. A fan had come behind the Davidson bench and
was pounding Lefty on the back as a Vanderbilt shot
went through the net. Trainer Tom Couch told the boy
to get back to his seat. The fan had just invited Couch
into the aisle to settle things when a policeman restored
order.

Any team playing in Nashville expects to hear
enthusiastic cheering for Vanderbilt. But courtesy and
sportsmanship on the part of the fans is something
else that a team expects. It would be a shame if a team
as good as Vanderbilt would gain the reputation as a
team that wins with partial referees and dangerous
spectators.

In light of the odds stacked against them, the
Wildcats did a fantastic job. Despite a strong
team, referees and a houseful of screaming, fighting
fans, Davidson answered a big question for its follow-
ers: it is a top-notch team. With the team spirit as high
as it is after that ball game, the 'Cats could really be
hard for anyone else to beat.

The confidence that they can handle Vandy in the
Sugar Bowl Tournament is shared by every member
of the team. If the ’Cats play a good game against
William & Mary this week, it is very unlikely that they
will fall in the national ratings, even with the loss.

"Cats Watch Bubble Burst,
Lose Nashville Nightmare

By DANNY WHITE

Assistant Sports Editor

For 44 minutes and 58 sec-
onds Tuesday night, the sur-
prising Davidson Wildcats.
led by a rejuvenated Rod
Knowles, outran, outshot, and
outdefensed the nationally
third-ranked Vanderbilt Com-
modores. But they lost in the
last two seconds of the over-

time contest, 81-79, on an off-'

balance jump shot by Tom-
my Hagen.

Even in defeat the Wild-
cats proved to the basketball
world that they are to be
reckoned with. Entering the
Vandy game with four unim-
pressive victories, the ‘Cats
had yet to put forth a con-

certed effort.

Davidson coach Charles
(Lefty) Driesel! summed up
the defeat better than any-
one. “We proved for the
first time that we can play
anybody in the country and
beat them.”

Not only did the defeat
prove that preseason ex-
pectations of the ‘Cats were
not too great, but it also pro-
duced one of the finest efforts
by senior captain Rod Knowl-
es. Knowles, outshone by the
talented sophomore duo of
Mike Maloy and Doug Cook
in the ‘Cats first four games,
poured in a game-high 22
points and pulled in 19 re-
bounds.

Winless Matmen

Lose To

Highly regarded William -&
Mary proved tdo powerful for
the Davidson wrestlers in a
match last Friday in Wil-
liamsburg. Va. The Wildcats
lost to the Indians 27-7, their
third loss in three matches.

However, the meet was
closer than the score indi-
cates. Valuable team points
slipped away from the ‘Cats
in close matches involving
Dean Cromartie, Jack
Jacobs, and Joe Cabanas.

Only two Davidson wrest-
lers kept the meet from be-
coming a complete rout.
Colin Hudson stalemated his
opponent in the 123 pound
class for two points, while
Lowell Bryan, team captain
and Southern Conference
heavyweight champion, pick-
ed up five points for pinning
his man.

Coach Charles Parker,
adding thet William &
Mary has the strongest
squad in the Southern Con-
ference, evaluated the meet
with the Indians as a good
one and said that the
team’s performance went
about as he had expected.

THOSE WILD, WILD, WILDKITTENS

Jubilant frosh celebrate upset win.

Frosh Edge Blue Imps
With Exciting Comeback

Duke's Blue Imps, general-
ly regarded as one of the
best freshman basketball
teams in the nation, were
toppled by the Davidson
freshmen, 106-103. The come-
from-behind victory made
many fans gain new respect
for the Wildkittens.

“We just never gave up.”
said Ricky Snipes, who had
to leave the game because of
a cut forearm early in the
first half. Snipes, however,-
reentered the contest and
helped the ‘Kittens overcome
a second-half 24 point deficit.

Duke jumped to an early
lead in the game with the
height of 6-10 Randy Denton
and the sharpshooting of
Dick Devenzio leading the
way. Denton got into foul
trouble early, and had to sit
out the rest of the half, but
the Imps maintained a 12
Point lead. The halftime
score was 51-40.

The Duke freshmen came
out strong the second half

increasing their lead to 24
points with six and a half
minutes left. Then things
began to work for Davidson.
In the next one and a half
minutes, Denton, Litz, and
Brad Evans fouled out.

The press that Davidson
had just applied began to
work, and the ‘Kittens cut
into the Duke lead, behind
the scoring and rebounding
of Steve Kifley. Kirley took
game honors with 39 points
and 17 rebounds. Kirley also
scored the last four points,
blocked Duke's last shot and
then stole a pass to seal up
the game.

*‘With three minutes left and
us still 11- points down," said
Duncan Postma, ‘‘Snipes

told me, ‘We've got ‘em now:
they're really shook.” And
with Coach Conboy keeping
us fired up, we did catch
them.” ‘

“Since they were guarding
Snipes so close," Kirley add-
ed, “I was able to get under
the boards more. There I
caught a lot of fouls.’ Kirley
Was 13 for 16 at the foul line.
* Only seven Wildkittens saw
action Saturday night:
Snipes, Kirley, Postma, Af-
feldt, Pierce, Stelzer and
Earty.

Monday—Friday

Indians

The Wildcats’ major prob.
lem is lack of experinece.
Out of nine starters, five are
freshmen, who will need a lot
more experience on the col-

lege mats before they can be .

expected to equal their more
seasoned opponents, he said.

Parker added, “You're just
not going to win many meets
with that many freshmen.
After getting more experi-
ence, they'll help our team
a lot. We'll be a lot strong-
er after Christmas when Ker-
ry Keith comes back.”

Keith, a top wrestler in
the Southern Conference last
season, has been sidelined
with a football injury.

The ograpplers’ next
match will be against UNC
in Johnston Gym, Friday
at 2. Parker said, “I’ve
seen UNC wrestie once be-
fore this season and they’ve
got a good squad. They
beat VMI. (who defested
the ‘Cats earlier this sea-
son). We sneaked by them
last year, Maybe we can
do it again.”

“Rodney definitely played
his best game this year and
maybe his best ever,”’ said
Driesell. ‘‘He played good de-
fense on Perry Wallace

(nine points) and boxed him

off the boards."

Led by Knowles, Davidson
jumped off to an early lead
in the frantic contest and
held a five-point Jead at
half-time, 44-39.

The ‘Cats increased thelr
lead to 13 points, 58-45,
with 14:30 remaining but
then the bottom fell out.
The Commodores started to
break through the tenacious
Davidson defense and be-
gan to draw fouls In the
process. Meanwhile, the
Davidson offensive machine
slowed down and connected
on only six field goals in
the last 15 minutes of the
game.

After Vandy had trimmed
the ‘Cat lead to three points
with 3:50 left in the game.
Driesell sent the ‘Cats into a
freeze. The Commodores
turned the strategy into fail-
ure as they stole the ball
twice to forge into a one-
point lead with 50 seconds
left.

Wayne Huckle then con-
nected on the second of two
free throws after being foul-

ed with 37 seconds remain
ing. Vandy played for one
ast shot, but Hagen’'s shot at
the buzzer was off its mark.
sending the game into over-
time.

.We didn’t make our free
throws. That was the differ-
ence in the game,’ com-
mented Driesell. -‘* The
strange thing is that we went
to their stadium the day be-
fore just to practice foul
shots.”’

The loss leaves the nation-
ally eighth-ranked Wildcats
with a 4-1 record going into
Friday's contest with confer-
ence foe William & Mary.

Davidson has an opportu-
nity fo avenge the foss to
Vandy in the Sugar Bowl
invitational Tournament to
be held Dec. 29-30 in New
Orleans. The ‘Cats face
tough Memphis State while
Vanderbilt goes against
Michigan State in the open-
ing round action. Should
both teams win, they would
meet In the finals.

In action earlier in the
week, Davidson romped by
Big Ten opponent Michigan,
91-70, behind Mike Maloy and
Rodney Knowles. Knowles
led the offense with 18 points
followed by Huckel with 15
and Kroll with 14.

B-Ball Dropouts
Form Drop ’Cats

Five former Davidson
basketball players have or-
ganized a team to play in
the Charlotte Industrial Lea-
gue. Calling themselves
Stone's Drop ‘Cats, the team
crushed Piedmont Poultry,
145-37, in its opening game.

Bob Stone, a Davidson
graduate presently working
as an insurance agent in
Davidson, sponsors the team.
George Leight and Pinky
Hatcher are the  player-
coaches.

The other former Wildcat
hoopsters are. Cecil Clifton,
Mike Dickens and Johnny
Baker. Ron Hunt and Geoff
Birkhead round out the Drop
‘Cat squad.

Leight commented on the
team's first win, ‘We got off
to a disappointing start but
we hope to do better in the
future.” In that game every-
one on the team scored easily
Hunt leading the effort with
33.

Clifton said that the Drop
‘Cats are looking for a tough-
er game this week against
Better TV. He also said that
the team hopes to face the
Davidson freshman later in
the year, if an arrangement
can be made.

The team takes its game
seriously, closely observing
two strict training rules. The
first is that all players must
obey all rules. The other is
that the boys must pass a
daily 11 o'clock bed check—
anybody out of bed before 11
in the morning is in trouble
with the coach.

«Speaking of the team's
chances for the rest of the

Hub

season, Clifton said, “If we
can keep playing our good
tough defense we'll do all
right.”

records were broken. The
Deacons downed the ‘Cats
65-39, while the Bulldogs fell
§3-51.

“I am well pleased with
the boys’ work so far this
year. Swimming is a game of
conditioning and to compete
as some of our boys have
this early in the season shows
they are really hard work
ers. If they keep this up we
will be OK.”

Against the Demon Deacons,
the ‘Catfish showed this com-
petitive spirit. Eddie Beach
demonstrated the ability
which has made him team
captain as he earned two
firsts and a second. He
broke the school record in
the 1000 freestyle with a time

of 11:59.3.

Freshman Jack Steele con-
tinded his assault on the rec-
ord book as he also set a rec-
ord in the 200 yard free-style,
but lost the race. Steele fin-
ished with two seconds, and
Mac Davis, the other David-
son standout, finished with
two firsts.

Against The Citadel, David-
son scored the fewest num-
ber of points a team can
score and still win as it
squeezed out a 53-51 victory.
Steele grabbed three first
places—in the 100, 200, and
500 yard free styles. He set
Davidson records in the 100
and 500, and it should be
noted he swam the 500 with
only three minutes’ rest.

Beach again set a record,
this time in the 200 yard
breast stroke, beating his old
record of 2:35 by three sec-
onds, 2:31.8. Beach also won
another first and one second.

‘We were able to win this
one by putting together sev-
eral first and second place
finishes in the same event,”
Stevens stated. “We did it in
three events. thus gathering
24 points. We got first in
three other events, giving us
15 more points. The rest were
earned on various seconds
and thirds.”

Coach Stevens said that
the next meet will be with
Clemson University Jan. 11.
The meet will be in Johnston
Gym.

Wildcats Hope To Improve
Ratings In Tourney Action

Davidson's basketball Wild-
cats take to the tournaments
during the Christmas holi-
days in an attempt to
strengthen their national
prestige. The basketballers
will participate in the Char-
lotte Invitational on Dec. 18-
19, and the Sugar Bowl Tour.
nament, Dec. 29-30, in New
Orleans.

Davidson coach Lefty Drie-
sell bluntly stated the im-
portance of the Christmas
tournaments following David-
son’s overtime loss to Van-
derbilt. “If we can beat
William and Mary and then
win our own Charlotte Invi-
tational and then beat Vandy
in the Sugar Bowl Tourna-
ment, there's no reason why
we shouldn't be the number
three team in the nation.”

In addition to Davidson,
the Charlotte Invitational will
feature Temple. Rice and

the surprising Redskins of
Miami University (Ohio). The
Wildcats will face Miami in
the opening game of the
tournament on Monday, while
Temple squares off with Rice
in the second game.

Miami of Ohio, which fin-
ished the 1966.67 with a 14-10
record, began the 1967 cam-
paign with an upset victory
over Dayton—the fifth rank
ed team in the nation at the
time. Temple is also strong
and has eight returning let-
termen from last year's
squad which posted a 20-8
record on its way to a berth
in the NCAA Eastern Region-
als.

The Sugar Bowl Tourna-
ment in New Orleans ranks
as one of the highlights of
the holiday tournaments as
the eighth-ranked Wildcats
are expected to meet the
third-ranked Vanderbilt Com-
