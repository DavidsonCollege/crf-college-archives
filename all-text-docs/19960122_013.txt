Dead Man Walking soundtrack
takes new turn for movie music

DEAD MAN
WALKING

By Jacos ABRAHAM
Staff Writer

Movie soundtracks just ain’t
what they used to be. The days of
the traditional orchestral score are

numbered. These days, directors .

are going for the more commer-
cially viable option of hiring popu-
lar musicians to contribute songs
to their films. '

Unlike the mood-Setting
scores of the past, this relatively
new breed of soundtracks poses a
certain problem. Unless the film is
aiming for nostalgia (see Good
Morning Vietnam, Platoon,
Forrest Gump, etc. ad infinitum),
pop songs seldom have any con-
nection to the film’s content. The
last few years have witnessed sev-
eral inventive but unsuccessful at-
tempts to wed song and content,
such as Trent Reznor’s irritating
musical collage for Natural Born
Killers. :

Actor/director Tim Robbins
has found a more viable solution
with the soundtrack to his new
film, Dead Man Walking. Robbins
sent the script toa number of promi-
nent singer-songwriters and asked
them to write pieces with the story
of the film in mind. The results are
nothing short of spectacular.

Of course, with a roster of
such acclaimed artists, the album
could hardly go wrong. Still as
vibrant as he was in the 50s, Johnny

Cash continues‘his‘crossover from

Nashville’s musical ghetto into the
alternative mainstream with “In
Your Mind.” Another welcome
comeback kid, Patti Smith con-
tributes the eerie ‘““Walkin Blind.”
Lyrical wizard and _ vocal
sadomasochist Tom Waits deliv-
ers a pair of tunes that would be
right at home on his Grammy-win-
ning 1992 masterpiece, Bone Ma-

chine.

Two contributors play a curi-
ous game of role reversal. Bruce
Springsteen plagiarizes the sing-
ing and songwriting style of the
unfortunately absent Bob Dylan,
while Steve Earle does a wicked
Boss impersonation with his own
haunting “Ellis Unit One.”

Suzanne Vega emerges from
along absence with the pop-indus-
trial clamor of “Woman on the
Tier (I’ll'See You Through).” Lyle
Lovett and Mary Chapin Carpen-
ter shake their country labels with
a pair of mournful acoustic bal-
lads. Folkster Michelle Shocked
pulls off one of the soundtrack’s
lyrical high points with the quirky,
inspiring “Quality of Mercy.”

Grunge poster boy Eddie
Vedder shines in the most surpris-
ing collaboration on_ the

soundtrack, with Pakistani vocal-
ist Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Com-
bining instruments, singing styles,
and languages of the East and West,
Vedder and Ali Khan’s songs have
a universal appeal that blurs cul-
tural distinctions and unifies the
album in a transcendent spiritual
whole.

Perhaps Robbins’ biggest ac-
complishment is choosing a group
of artists whose styles so effec-
tively complementeach other while
exploring the film’s themes and
characters. Bluesman Ry Cooder’s
guitar work and production on vari-
ous songs helps to give the album
its musical consistency. The cohe-
sive, meditative mood allows the
Dead Man Walking soundtrack to
stand on its own, independent of
the film, as one of the best albums
of the new year.
