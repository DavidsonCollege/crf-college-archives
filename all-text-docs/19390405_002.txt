Ever since the election for the Editor of
The Davidsonian was stopped by the Stu-
dent Council the entire Student Body has
been beset by rumors—rumors which were
false or exaggerated, or rumors which were
true, The students had no way of knowing
just where they stood, mainly because the
action of the Council is secret. First of all
then, I suggest that the Council take the
initiative in making it legal for its actions
to be announced to the Student Body.

It was perfectly right for the Council to
investigate the election, but
they stopped it and offered a new method
of selection of the editor’ without making
a thorough investigation of the charges
in what seems to have been an attempt to
evade the issue.

Naturally, under such peculiar circum-
stances, the amendment failed to pass and
the Council sought other action. All this
time various rumors were circulating the
campus, and after one decision had been
reached the groups affected appealed the
case. Additional evidence was produced,
enough to clarify the matter, and one of the
groups was found innocent; yet the others
were to be punished in such a way that
the most harm would have been done to
the group found not guilty even by the Stu-
dent Council!

Davidsonian

In its inquiry the Council seemed to be
more eager to punish, through any avail-
able technicalities, than to seek out the
truth. Their duty should have been to do
justice—to ascertain whether there was
guilt or innocence instead of simply hunting
guilt.

The Council sought to prove guilt be-

it was plain that officials were neg-
ligent in conducting them—actually
to the extent of violating the rules
—nothing was done, because no ac-
cusation was made.

When it finally completed its
hearings the Council realized it
find any of the accused
parties guilty, but in the statement
to the Student Body it was nat
made clear that they were inno-
cent. Could it be that the Council
did not want to admit its error?
It had wasted about ten days and
had accomplished nothing. Had the
Council investigated the matter
properly and unbiasedly this delay
could have been avoided. (By “un-
biasedly” I mean searching for
Truth; not Guilt alone).

It developed that the groups in
question had to practically prove
innocence instead of the Council's
having to prove guilt. The Council
let the issue be clouded by de-
tails and impressions when it should
have looked at the whole and done
justice. A

As a result the Council caused
worry and trouble to the candidates
and the accused parties. Its action
brought forth a feeling of mutual
martyrdom among the questioned
groups, which perhaps created~a

cooperative feeling approaching the
very combine which was supposed
to exist and which the Council
was to make sure would not be.
The Student Council is said to be
“the most esteemed body on the

campus.”

See that it regains that
position.

SOLUTION ... Since you read
the sports pages rather more dili-
gently than a lesson assignment,
you probably noticed in the Ob-
server last week the cartoon show-
ing the agents of a travel bureau
trying to think of a cruise that
they might sell to Admiral Byrd.
Well we knoW the answer, and we
speak with some authority. For our
stateroom was only a few steps
away from his on a Bermuda bound
boat some ten days ago.

Now, a semi-tropical island might
seem a bit out of the arctic ex-
plorer’s line, but of course, his
wife, two daughters and Harvard-
man son may have had some in-

should go to Bermuda, though.
(Incidentally, “the Bermudas” is a
more accurate term, since it is a
group of islands numbering some-
where between 100 and 400—the
number depending on how big a
rock has to be before you call it
an island.) “Picturesque” is the first
word that comes to mind in de-
scribing it. It’s a sort of incredible
mixture of the mountains (judging
from the air and rough terrain),
the sea-coast, and a dash of Eng-
land. The oddest sight to David-

river or spring on the place.

Bicycling is the prevalent mode
of transportation, though you can
get a carriage if you're lazy or
have a yen for comfort. Driving on
the left doesn’t seem so strange
after a half an hour or so, and
from then on it’s automatic—with
embarrassing lapses. Don’t let any-
body tell you there are no autos
on the island. The law is that there
be no private autos on the public
roads. The government has several
trucks, an ambulance, etc., and if
you're a Vanderbilt you can drive
about your estate to your heart's
content. No real need for cars,
though, since the whole island is
only about 15 miles long and very
narrow.

But anyway, it’s a place where
horses are startled by a loud, me-
chanical noise, and the dogs never
bark at a bike.
