The Light Dawns

The charge has been made repeatedly
that we tend to curl up into our comfor-
table but isolated cells here at Davidson
daring the world to break through. This
has too often proven true. However, stu-
dent response to the Y-sponsored debate
Wednesday night was an encouraging
and challenging contradiction to our
cloistered complacency. Discussion con-
tinued long past the termination of the
debate in coffee clubs, room sessions. and
convenient lobbies; and it is hoped that
stich positive reaction will not fade away
with the exit of the speakers. There has
been a crying need for such interactive,
focused, and stimulative presentation on
the Davidson’ campus not for months but
for years.

To those organs of study and express-
ion on national and world affairs—to the
IRC, Y Committee for Effective Citizen-
ship, YRC, Scabbard and Blade, and study
groups—here is a challenge to continue
the spirit and quality of enthusiasm in
this program into further presentations
of similar nature, in seminars. informa-
tive literature, and other available means
And to each of us comes the renewed
challenge, pressurized by the world situ-
ation, by the immient responsibilities and
demands of our near future, and by our
present position at Davidson, to seek, to
find, and to evaluate the truth wherever
it may be found.

Speakers of Stature

In recent months, new ideas,
trends, and attitudes have brought
about a significant improvement in
the educational program offered at
Davidson in almost every field. How-
ever, there is yet one dark corner to
which, despite the efforts of many,
no light has been carried. This is the
dearth of outstanding and competant
national authorities in many fields
who could shed valuable insights on
the Davidson campus. Davidson
should have these speakers. It is her
duty to secure them, and her import-
ance is great enough to warrant their
presence here; yet none appear.

This situation is not entirely due to
the fact that students and various groups
are not interested in national, political,
and international problems or are not
attempting to bring such speakers to the
campus. The. difficulty lies in the fact
that this task is too large for several
small groups working independently to ac-
complish.

It should be emphasized that there have
been many outstanding programs along
these lines presented during the year,
and several more are on tap. An excellent
example of this is the debate held recent-
ly between Dr. Lewis M. Hoskins and Mr.
Harry Golden on the topic of pacifism
and power politics in the conduct of
foreign policy. Such presentations should
be increased in frequency if possible.

_ At the same time. Davidson has never
reached tHe zenith in such presentations,
never securing the most emminent and
qualified authorities in each field, con-
sequently never presenting many topics
as effectively as they might be presented.

There are several clubs, committees,
and councils on the campus who are
actively seeking to promote greater stu-
dent interest in politics, national and in-
ternational affairs, and other problems
which face our goverment in these trou-
bled times Often these groups work at
cross purposes. Certainly their funds are
not pooled effectively. What is needed
obviously is greater coordination, perhaps
one centralized body which would actively
promote and seek to stimulate interest in
these topics.

The student government favors this
plan and feels that the desired results
can best be obtained through the chapel
committee. No one would disagree that
this year’s chapel committee has done far
more to improve the quality, usefulness,

and value of the chapel exercise than the

last four or five chapel committees com-

bined. This same committee has made a

valiant, if as yet unsuccessful, attempt

to bring about the very aims being
stressed in this editorial.
in the secular field, considering

the financial resources available, Da-
vidson should settle for no less than
two such qualified experts per year,
and in time this could easily be raised
to four or six. Purely for illustrative
purposes the following names are sug-
gested of those who might adequately
fill, all specifications: Walter Lipp-
man, Adlai Stevenson, Reinhold Nie-
buhr, Stewart Alsop. Bernard Ba-
ruch, Allan Dulles, Henry Cabot
Lodge, Jr., Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor,
Warren Austin, George Meaney,
Eleanor Roosevelt. Clare Booth Luce,
Harloe Curtice, and Ernest Heming-
way. This list could be continued in-
definitely.

There is no difficulty in listing suita-
ble and desirable people. The difficulty
lies in making contact with these people
over a long period of years, and bring-
ing to a conclusion the painful process
of determining which of these people
would consider coming to Davidson and
under what, terms. This is one of the
main difficulties facing most groups to-
day: the necessity of starting from
scratch whenever a speaker is desired.

An essentia! step in solving this prob-
lem would lie in combining into one
unified fund all of the resources
from foundation grants, student activ-
ities fees, and general college funds,
which are now being distributed in small
parcels to the many separate groups.

The second step and probably the
key to the whole problem is co-ordination.
As we stated earlier, the student govern:
ment favors handling this. problem
through the chapel committee. Two al-
is an enlarged chapel committee. which
would include representatives from the
various organizations who by the very
ternatives thus present themselves One
nature of their groups are the ones closest
and most interested in many of these.
problems and should thus be. accorded
representation. The second possibility is
to form a separate committee composed
of representatives of these groups which
would work closely with the chapel com-
mittee and would co-ordinate the activity
on that phase of the chapel planning
problem.

One thing more is essential, how-
ever and no new organization can
bring this about. It is a continuation
of the new philosophy adopted by the
chapel committee, an attempt to
make chapel really meaningful and
valuable and an attempt to secure
the services of the very people that
we have mentioned. —T.W.W.

Around the Poll...

This month’s student opinion poll,
while drawing some interesting com-
parisons, needs a few qualifying ‘com-
ments. It must be noted that student rat-
ing of the academic departments was
based on two factors, the nature of the
courses and their presentation. As the
expressed criticisms revealed, low rating
in several cases was based on deficient
number and quality of courses presented
and on the insufficient number of profes-
sors available to handle the department
adequately in proportion to the students
involved.

The departmental chairmen through
the office of Dean Pietenpol are urged to
consider the evaluative comments pre-
sented by those majoring in their re-
spective departments. Founded on limited
experience and comparative basis, they
are nevertheless given with thought and
conviction in the best interests of David-
son and ought not to be considered
lightly. They represent in many cases
similar needs recognized by faculty mem-
bers and department chairmen. Although
all of these proposals cannot be realized,
many of them can, and these merit fullest
attention.

DAVIDSONIAN PLATFORMS ARE PRESENTED

Jim Batten

An annual platform observation,
which can be made this year of
the Morehead regime with un-
tainted sincerity, is that the David-
sonian has enjoyed a year of un-
paralled success as the news and
editorial voice of the college.

With this in mind, it is with
natural reluc-
tance that I
would suggest
anything com-
parable (o a. pro-
gram of sweep-
ing reforms In-
stead, it would
be my intention
to retain the es-
tablished pat-

terns and to Batten
perpetuate _re-
cent improvements, while intro-

ducing without hesitation appro-
priate changes and innovations, for
which there is definitely a place

CAMPUS-WIDE NEWS
COVERAGE

Complete and objective report-
ing of the news is the prime pur-
pose of any. college newspaper
worth its activities fee appropria-
tion.

News originating from the
faculty and administration would
be obtained through continuation
of the two-way traffie of informa-
tion between the student body and
the powers that be. This type of
exchange, fostered through per-
sonal contacts, the monthly staff
luncheons with Dean Spencer, and
devices such as polling the faculty,
and The Op2n Forum, has proven
& potent weapon in combating the
Almighty Rumor as the official
campus source of information, and
in the upswing of student-faculty
relations since their low-water
mark of two springs ago.

EDITORIAL PAGE AND POLICY

The Davidsonian should take a
well-defined editorial stand on all
questions and issues pertinent to
tho life of the college, through
presentation in the regular edi:
torial columns. While student opin-
ion would be mirrored here, the
views eXxpre:sed in these columns
would be those of the. editors, and
not necessarily those of a majority
of the student body, believing with
UNC’s fame. editors Yoder and
Kraar that constant agreement is
indeed dull. .

The remainder of the editorial
page would be devoted to the
presentation of all sides of the
issues and controversies which are
more or less ever with us, from
the enrollment debate to the Court
of Control quandry, as well as
those which will inevitably arise
during the course of the year.

One of the more pressing of the
matters is the recently launched
and long-overdue evaluation of the
Academic Process at Davidson. For
all of our fevent introspection in
recent years dealing at length with
the YMCA. Student Government,
athletic policy, and the Military, it
seems to me that we have too long
failed to pause to take stock of
ourselves in the most basic and
fundamental area of all, the liber-
al education. The Davidsonian un-
der my editorship would strive to
continue and expand this critical
self-analysis, and would continually
and vigorously fight the sugges-
tion, popular in some quarters,
that Davidson should relax in some
measure its academic standards.

_Close cooperation would be
maintained between the Davidson-
ian and the new student body
president, with the possibility of
a bi-monthly or monthly: column
by the president, devoted to in-
forming the students of student
government policy and activity.

The weekly cartoon would defi-
nitely be continued, and would be
produced by home-grown cartoon-
ists whenever possible. Light, and
humorous material “would be
sought to give the paper versa-
tility and depth, with specially
planned dance weekend features,

condusive to tete-a-tete reading
over intermission coffee and
doughnuts.

THE SPORTS PAGE

Beyond the mere run-of-the-
mill pre-game announcements and
post-game recap stories, the ath-
letic scene offers a rich source of
untapped material. I would favor
more colorful feature-type sports
articles dealing with the players
and coaches themselves as seen
from the dugout or in practice ses-
sions, instead of entirely imper-
sonal, authoritative, press box aec-
counts of the team’s collective
showing.

Believing statistics to be the
sports fan's bread and butter, an
increased and up to date volume of
both team and individual statistics

would be presented, to include
baseball boxscores and similar
summaries for the other major
sports.

I also feel that published statis-
tics would prove a shot in the arm!
to interfraternity competition.
Keeping weekly tabs on the league
leaders should generate more in-
erest among both players and spec-
tators. This could easily be done
with the basketball league, and
with adequate cooperation and
staff manpower could be extended
to inelude softball’s top hitters and
home run producers, and in the
fall, flickerball’s leading scorers.

A revival of all star selections in
sports other than basketball is also
a definite possibility.

ORGANIZATIONALLY

One of the weakest aspects of
Davidsonian organization over the
past years has been a dire lack of
a competent and dependable nu-
cleus of news and sports reporters.
In an effort to remedy this situa-

tion, all prospective freshmen
whose records show even the
slightest journalistic inclinations

will be contacted this summer and
informed of the workings of the
Davidsonian and of the opportuni-
ties which exist.

In the fall, all interested men
will be contacted and put to work,
with rotation of assignments and
periodic meetings of the entire
staff designed to insure continued
interest.

Not all of the improvements of
the Davidsonian can stem from
the gloss of appealing features and
slick presentation. Many of the
less conspicuous possibilities in-
volve basically sound reporting of
the regular week-in. week-out news
stories that collectively tell the
Story of Davidson.

Franklin
Bloodworth

The editorship of the Davidson-
jan presents a tremendous chal-
lenge to that person chosen by the
student body to fill this important
position. The responsibility of this
challenge—to make the Davidson-
ian a potent force for progress and
improvement on the campus—is
one that I will enthusiastically ac-
cept if I am cus
elected editor. q

To meet suc-
cessfully’ this
challenge I pro-
pose the follow-
ing suggestions
in the sincere
belief that they
will result in 3
more _ interest-
ing and influ.
ential newspa-
per.

REORGANIZATION OF THE

SPORTS PAGE

Every sports contest, both col-
legiate and interfraternity, should
be reported on the sports page. All
interfraternity athletic events
should be given full and unbiased
coverage each week, and a greater
emphasis on the minor sports, as
well as continued coverage of the
major sports, should be under.
taken..

This year there has been a very
pressing need for more space on
the sports page in order to give a
fuller coverage of the Davidson
athletic scene. To provide more
space, the elimination of the David-
sonien “Mast Head” usually found
on the sports page, which is both
unnecessary and repetitious, will
allow an additional twelve square ,
inches of copy each week. If neces-
sary, several columns on the back
page could be used for sports
stories.

A REVITALIZED EDITORIAL

PAGE

The editorial page should serve
a dual purpose: it should serve as
‘a means for the student body to
make known their wishes to the
faculty and administration on such
matters as athletic subsidization,
enrollment, curriculum and calen-
dar changes, etc. In turn, the edi-
torial page should also function as
an outlet for faculty expression on
such matters, in the hope that a
better understanding between stu-
dents and faculty will result.

When any important issue faces
the college family all sides of the
question should be fully and fairly
discussed and analyzed. Editorials
by members of the student body
should be solicited, and the “Let-
ters to the Editor” column should
be open for this purpose.

However, the Davidsonian itself
should take a definite stand on
these issues, supporting that alter-
native which the staff feels would
be for the best interests of the
college. A planned and directed
editorial policy is a must if the

Bloodworth :

Davidsonian is to fulfill the pur-
pose for which it was established.

A good local cartoon, the rota-
tion of qualified writers, shorter
editorials, and careful editorial se-
lectivity, to insure and improve
the quality and content of the edi-
torials, should éver be the goals
of editorial policy.

RE-EVALUATION OF THE
FRONT AND BACK PAGES

The primary function of the
front and back pages should be
to report news of interest to the
college family. In order for the
news articles to be of interest,
however, they must be timely. Ev-
ery effort. should be made to se-
cure the first reports of such news
breaks as the resignation of faculty
members and the actions of the
trustees and faculty. It is only fair
that the camps publication be
given first notice of such events.

A greater emphasis should be
given to news evaluation in the
hope of preventing the monopoly
of the news columns by certain
aspects of college life. Complete
and impartial news coverage
should be accorded to all activities
and to all departments.

Unfortunately this year lack of
space has forced the omission of
many worthwhile news _ stories.
This has been the result, partly,
of. the over-emphasis placed on fea-
ture articles. Feature articles, such
as the senior sketches and opinion
polls, certainly have a definite
place in the newspaper, but their
multiplication should never be al-
lowed to the extent that omission
of valid news stories is necessi-
tated.

One possible remedy to this lack
of space on the front and back:
pages, as well as on the sports
page, is the publication of more
six-page papers each year.

A more factual, objective ac-
count of the news will result, in
shorter’ articles and thus more
room for other news. Editorializ:
ing. in the news columns should
never be tolerated.

ACCURATE, INTERESTING,
WELL-WRITTEN NEWS
ARTICLES

By an expansion of the staff to
include members from every fra-
ternity as well as ‘independents, by
a more careful selection of the
staff to include only those men

_who excell in writing, and by an

intensified program of training in
journalistic methods for the staff,
the general standard of the news
articles would be raised. Accuracy,
timeliness, clearness, and concise-
ness should be set standards for
news articles.

These are some of the sugges-
tions that I believe will help to
make the Davidsonian a more vital,
the Davidsonian took its rightful
place as a powerful influence for
the improvement of the college. If.
you see fit to elect me editor, 1
promise to apply my three years of
experience on the paper and de-
vote my full efforts to this end—
a better Davidsonian for a better
Davidson.

Leon Howell

e
Even a small opportunity to

share and participate in the tradi-

tions and responsibilities of: the
press is, in effect, an awesome
position to be placed in. If I am
selected to the editorship, I shall
attempt to up .

hold the high
standards estab-
lished here and
elsewhere to
the best of my
ability.

An analysis of
the primary
functions and
areas of re-
sponse that
must be given :
complete and accurate coverage
reveals three distinct departments:
news, editorials, and. features.

NEWS REPORTING

It should be within the scope of
the news staff to procure and pro-
duce on the pages of the David-
sonian all items of interest and
importance to the Davidson stu-
dent.

in retrospect of this years’ news
policy, | have reached the conclu-
sion that more emphasis ought to
be placed on concise and complete
presentation of specific news
sources and reserving the edi-
torial page for the “slanted” arti.
cles, in which opinion and satire
are incorporated.

ca

Howell

In order to increase the cali-
ber of the finished product for
this year and to inhance the quali-
ty of years to come, a concerted
attempt will be made to take full
advantage of qualified freshmen
and to enlist a greater number
than has been done in previous
years. Outstanding writers in the
upper classes will also be solicited.

Specifically, the giant stride for-
ward in informing the students of
the Student Council actions will
be continued; reports from the
administration and trustees per-
tinent to students will be stated;
fraternities, sports, and other acti-
vities will continue to receive their
full treatment.

EDITORIAL OUTLOOK

Whereas the news will be re-
ported in- a factual and objective
manner, the editorial. page will
attempt to present, clarify, and
discuss both sides of all problems
related to college students. These
will touch on student attitude,
Opinions on Student Government
and faculty moves, national and
international items of interest and
importance. Examination and cri-
tical evaluations will be offered
on topics of current interest such
as; segregation, cirriculum, and in-
creasing of enrollment.

In the two columns reserved
for the editor and his associates
their judgments and observations
will be presented. There will be no
attempt to be radical in an effort
to become a “gadfly”, but the
policy will be sincerely and honest-

ly directed toward generating and
promulgating student awareness of
problems that exist.

Dependent upon continued stu-
dent interest, such additional edi-
torial page material as the “Open
Forum”, Letters to Editor, and ad-

ditional questions and answers will

be carried over.

_ FEATURES AND SPORTS

Another carry-over from recent
years will be the continuation of
polls on subjects of importance
to the Student Body, as well as
sketches on campus fixtures and
personnel to be determined later.
This, of course, will be under the
direction of one capable person
who will insure the worthwhile-
ness and quality of these projects.

One of the most neglected areas
in reporting this past year was the
Inter-fraternity Sports scene. it is
proposed here to have one quali-
fied writer to report weekly on the
IFC sports to provide adequate
presentation. More aid in assign-
ments and copy reading will be
tendered the page to improve it
in form as well as content.

As is clearly shown above, the
purpose and guiding aim of the
Davidsonian under my “Regime”
would be to collect the news,
determine that which is news-
worthy, project various interpre-
tations, prepare it with care and
precision, and disseminate it on
the pages of the paper each Friday
night. It should be, then, that the
Davidsonian would be the total
student voice.

STAFF AND
ADMINISTRATION PROPOSALS

In an effort to increase the
unified action in accomplishing the
above goals, weekly staff meetings
would be held to discuss proposed
areas for discussion, to determine
and promulgate the policy upon
which we are building, and to criti-
que the past week’s issue, de-
termining its strong and weak
points with a better issue in mind.

From the circulation standpoint
a vigorous drive will be made to
increase the number of subscrip-
tions that are being mailed out,
thereby presenting more people
with an inside view of what is be-
ing accomplished and what is pro-
posed for Davidson.

The underclassmen who will be
directing the activities of the
paper the next year would be
given more opporunity for experi-
ence and orientation. This would
decrease the necessity of the edi-
tor and his staff “flying blind” the
first few issues.

Concerning the layout, there are
no radical changes offered at pre-
sent. A vivid and unique, as well
as pleasing, paper will be our aim.
If, through experience and out-
side contact, a plan we feel to be
more desirable is discovered, it
will be presented. This year’s fine
picture coverage is a goal to reach
for, not attempt to surpass.

Once again, if | am elected, !
pledge myself to presenting a
paper that is truly representative
of Davidson.

ACADEMIC INTROSPECTION

Departmental CritiqueContinues

This week marks the second
in a series of articles designed
to evaluate Davidson academ-
ically With a critical analysis
in mind, the Davidsonian
posed three questions to the
chairmen of all departments
of the college:

1. What are the changes
that have been made in your
department in the last three
years?

2. What improvements
would you like to see made in
your department in the next
few years?

3. Would you comment fur-
ther on the academic standing
of Davidson in relation to
other similar liberal arts
schools as you can see it?

DEPARTMENT OF HISTORY

Question 1. We have had some
changes in personnel and some
changes in courses. We have added
two new courses (one in Russian
History and one in Twentieth Cen-
tury United States History) and
have revised several others. We
have also dropped one course
(Latin American History), since
Professor Guerrant left Davidson.
In addition we have now taken ov-
er one course formerly in Political
Science (Diplomatic History of the
United States).

Question 2.
would like to see a requirement
of a senior thesis for majors in
the Department, if and when ade-
quate library resources for such
work are acquired. Other improve-
ments contemplated evolve around

The Department -

more use of visual aids, maps, and
of course library books.

Question 3. Davidson rates well,
I think, among libéral arts col-
leges, Comparisons on details are
difficult to substantiate, but in a
general way my opinion is that Da-
vidson is well above the average
of such colleges in the South, and
that we are not at the top among
such colleges in the nation as a
whole. This is not altogether bad,
as it keeps us from being com-
placent and gives us something to
work toward,

DEPARTMENT OF ENGLISH

Question 1. The Department of
English added one man in Septem-
ber of 1955. The department is
slowly increasing its visual aid re-
sources. The department is slowly
but steadily adding to its library
materials and resources. In Sep-
tember of 1956 the department
plans to add English 13-14. which
will be open to students demon-
strating a high degree of pro-
ficiency in lieu of English 11-12.
That is, such students may substi-
tute English 13-14 for English
11-12 in meeting their English re-
quirements for a degree.

Question 2. It is quite difficult
to state in a short space the im-
provements I should like to see in
the department. Again, there are
many different areas that might
be involved. There are some three
of four courses which the depart-
ment would like to offer if regis-
tration were heavy enough to war-
rant the additional personnel that
would be needed. Every instructor

could probably list specific ways
in which he might, under optimum
conditions, improve the courses he
is already offering. ,

DEPARTMENT OF FINE ARTS

Question 1. Courses of instruc-
tion for the Fine Arts Department
have been increased from one com-
bination studio-art appreciation
course to three  two-semester
courses. These include a survey
of Art History, and Basic and Ad-
vanced Studio. There is also a
night Studio class for the faculty
and other members of the David-
son community. Studio space has
been enlarged and necessary
equipment obtained. An etching
press is the latest acquisition.

Question 2. Studio facilities
should be enlarged to accommo-
date increased enrollment. Al-
though, in the last three years, a
sizeable library of art slides has
been built up from a rather small
nucleus, the slide library is still
lacking in many areas — especially
in contemporary art. An adequate
slide collection is a necessity for
a vivid presentation of the History
of Art.

Question 3. Work accomplished .
in both Art History and Studio
classes compares favorably with
that done in institutions maintain-
ing a more extensive art program.
For verification of the latter com-
pare the exhibit of art works by
Davidson students with that by the
students of W.C.U.N.C., both of
which are on display at the Mint
Museum in Charlotte during the
month of March.
