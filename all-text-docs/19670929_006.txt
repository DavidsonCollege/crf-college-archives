James K. Batten about his
teip vo the Middle Enst dur-

He snid that the tsraelis
were convinced an Arab vic-
tory would be a massacre,
that Auschwitz would be para-

Isrnotis Foaared for ther

Alumnus Batten, Waghing-
tun correspondent fer The
Charlotte Observer and a for-
mer editor of THE DAVID-
SONIAN. said that the tmo-
bilizavion was prepared well
in advance and that the Is

arelis. had "a well-organized,
efficient press office.”

They even had alt candi-
tioned civillan buses lo Lake
the press corps to the fight
ing. But what was more as
tonishing. Baten said, was
that “half the Israeli army
was going to the Front the
aume way.”

The Isrnelig were ‘censor.

said, “1 had no way of koaw

“The Israeli mobilizauion
