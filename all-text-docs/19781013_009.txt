The Davidsonian

Booters hang tough

with Apps firepower |

‘By ROB GILLISON

If soccer coach Karl Kremser
had thoughts of a nationally
ranked team and Saturday’s
game is any indication of what
it takes he may as well forget it.
' The pushing, pulling, greb-
bing, tripping and generally
dirty play that took place on the
field would make a mockery of
Davidson's sacred honor code.

But given the circumstances,
Appalachian’s aggressiveness is
more understandable. They had
just come off a game against
North Carolina State that was
best described as a ‘‘brawl."

Apparently N:C.~ State
thought they could intimidate
their more highly skilled oppo-
nents. The plan back fires as
they lost 3 players to injuries
(two shoulder separations and a
knee injury) and the game.

Here at Davidson a large
crowd was treated to some fine
soccer, marred only by the final
score, 6-0, and the occasionally
questionable play. Appalachian
has four international players

' who exhibited some world class
play to the detriment of the
Wildcats. a

Davidson started the game in
a tough defense, concentrating
the players in their own third of
the field.

Appalachian’s first goal came
on.a line drive knuckle ball,
from the top of the goalie’s box
that seemed to be sailing high

over the goal. The ball then
dove wildly, sinking into the
corner of the Davidson goal.

The second goal was on a
weak shot that rolled up to the
goal through the goalie’s
hands, between his legs and
trickled into the net. Nobody
was more surprised than the
Appalachian player credited
with the score.

The third and last score of the
half came on a high cross that
six players rushed for, alter-
nately trying to convert or
prevent a score.

Men and ball arrived in the
same place at the same time. All

six ended up on the ground and —Fy 4

the ball ended up in the net.

The half ended with Appala-
chian on top 3-0 but two of
those goals were certainly no-
thing to write home about.

In the first few minutes of the
second half the referees had
apparently seen enough. One
Appalachian player was dis-
charged from the,game without
a warning and minutes later a
second was yellow carded (a yel-
low card is a warning, red is an
ejection).

The ejection seemed to fire up
the Davidson players who be-
gan to press the attack. But the
stronger offense also spread the
players out allowing Appala-
chian fo go one-on-one and

-- score their last three goals.

Coach Kremser was pleased
with the overall performance,

especially in comparison to
‘previous years.

“Last year we lost 8-0 and it
could have been worse. We only
got the ball over half field once.
This year we had 18 or 14 shots
on goal and with a little luck
and a few less defensive lapses
it could have been 3-0.”

He is particularly pleased
with the team’s reaction under
pressure and sees it as a real be-
nefit.

“When a 17 or 18 year old
freshman goes head-to-head
with a 25 year old international

player he’s going to be able to -

do much better than against
someone on his own level.” .

Against Furman on Tuesday,
the Wildcats lost 1-0. Furman
played what Kremser calls a
‘volleyball match,’’ just kic-
king the ball around, something
he vows will never happen on a
team he coaches.

“I may lose a few victories

(Jonathan Keith)
now, but my philosophy is to
make a good team and some
good players. ‘We're a 100 per-
cent better team than we were |
at the beginning of the season.”

This is the first year in a long
time that Davidson has recrui-
ted for soccer and Kremser is
working to further that commit-
ment. He feels it’s significant
that some of the best soccer
is played in the Ivy League and
Davidson is uniquely suited to
that.same situation.
