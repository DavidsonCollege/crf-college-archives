OPINIONS.

Manning, manning, bo-ban-
ning, banana-nana fo-fanning, me-
mi-mo-manning..
BOMANNING!

Most any Baby Boomer will
recall (some with a smile and some
with a groan, no doubt) the 1960s
novelty song “The Name Game.”
Now that the new campus direc-
tory has come out (and since no
one has shot me yet), I have been
tempted to play the name game all
over again with our newly pub-
lished e-mail addresses. It’s so
much fun it makes me wantto sing.
Tutti-frutti, dacerutti, a-wop-bop-
aloo-bop, a-wop-bam-boom!

But I digress . . . Actually, I
have more serious matters to con-
sider, including a major complaint
about our online monikers. Is there
an appeals process or are we stuck
with what we’ ve got? After all, the
Book of Proverbs tells us that “‘a
good name is rather to be chosen
than great riches.” So, who chose
our names, I ask? I sure didn’t
choose mine. We are assigned a
name that uses the first two letters
of our first name and the first six
letters of our last, thereby resulting
in some of the most awkward
names imaginable. And why are
staff members restricted to six let-
ters of their last name while faculty
and students get 10? Sounds like
alpha-numeric discrimination to
me. You'll be hearing from my
lawyers—jagibert, lydaniel, and
jablodgett.

Take my nom de screen, for
example: jestockd. Just how the
heck does one pronounce jestockd?
It would be so much more._¢l-

The name game

egant—and completely unambigu-
ous—if it were jerstock. But no-o-
0-0-0. My given name is jestockd.
Gesundheit!

Perhaps I shouldn’t com-
plain—it could be worse: krbradbe,
krkessle, brsoderb, or cliakob. Of
course, there’s little hope for
macsikszentm, whether truncated
or un. At least we prac-

What does one do with rocline? I
take itformirhea. And for gasloop?
My doctor recommends myknox.

For some things, however,
there is no relief in sight. I am
reminded once again to pity our
prospective students. First they
must attempt to gain admission to
Davidson by going through

contingent on campus? labrown,
lacain, lagarloc, lejones, laligo,
lemarsic, lepark, lesargen, lesatter,
to name just a few. Leave it to the
French to confuse us over gender
matters.

But I am relieved to know that
in our efforts to become more in-
ternational we have not forgotten

tice orthographic de-
mocracy around here—
we are all lower case
creatures, as befits our
Calvinist heritage.

For a lucky few
there is no confusion
whatsoever: Ed Kania
becomes edkania; Ed

Now that the new campus
directory has come out, I
have been tempted to play
the name game all over
again with e-mail addresses

our Scotch-Irish Appa-
lachian roots. There’s a
whole Ma and Pa Kettle
cohort on campus, so
many that] cannot name
them all and so politi-
cally correct that no one
can tell their gender éi-
ther: mabenson,
macampbell, mahyde,

Palmer, edpalmer; and
Al Mele, almele. But poor Edna
Rimmer undergoes a sex change.
Can’t win ’em all, edrimmer.

Speaking of confusion. . .
What are all these new orienta-
tions I’ve never heard of before?
bi-felty, bi-giduz, bi-drake, bi-
lawing, and bi-mahony?

And these strange new disor-
ders? co-savage? co-barton? 1
don’t know about you, but I’ll just
keep on being co-dependent.

In some cases we seem to have

both Ahe condition and the cure.

wopayne, and if they get in they
have to try to get financial aid out
of gopeck. I guess that’s better
than gofish.

Actually, the new e-mail di-
rectory is a good place to find
valuable information about the col-
lege. For instance, I hadn’t real-
ized what great strides we have
made to recruit faculty and staff
from the Indian sub-continent:
vikumar, vecase, namaydol,

rupittar, sastone, vatartag, patesh.

TV exposed

The other day, after a quick
Union break, I found this note by

my books in the computer center: .

“T quit - that’s it! - Ihave gone to
drink myself into oblivion - or at
least I would like to...maybe I will
go to Backstreet alone - all I can
say is *& @!$# the rat race!”

It was late. I had been work-
ing on a paper all day. My first
reaction: join my friend. No more!
Let me out!

Then came the guilt. With the
logic of a Health Center pamphlet,
I sat back down and started work-
ing. I started thinking about why
somany people are way too stressed
out and have unhealthy means of
relaxing (i.e. the man in the red car
who has taken to “exposing” his
problems). -

The answer: TV!. Of
course! We need better shows on
TV! Sure today we have Seinfeld,
The Simpsons, and even Friends,
but none measure up to those shows
from our youth. ‘Ssshows like
Hunter, Gimme a Break, Facts of

Life, Family Ties;*Silver Spoons, °

Laverne and Shirley, What's Hap-

_ pening, Scooby Doo, The Love

Boat, The Jeffersons, Happy Days,
Bosom Buddies, ‘Degrassi Junior
High, Jabberjaw, Good Times, The
Electric Company, Three’s Com-
pany, Diff rent Strokes and my all
time favorites:

Magnum, P.I. The king of
the one hour dramas. Magnum
always took the moral high ground.
My mom worshipped Tom
Selleck’s short shorts and his grav-
elly, voiceover narrations. Person-
ally, I liked T.C.’s yellow, orange
and black helicopter.

Hotel. My absolutely favorite
show which doesn’t even run on
cable anymore. What a travesty!
Hotel is a masterpiece. Itresembles
The Love Boat in a 20-story, met-
ropolitan building. Starring:
Connie Sellecaanda host of weekly
special guest stars.

Misfits of; Science. Courtney |
Cox pre-Family-Ti ies and way pre-

F riends costarred on this short-
lived series about a group of ordi-
nary,.people with not-so-ordinary
‘psychic:powers. Ofcourse, they
uae tite ee to fight crime.

The Bloodhound Gang. This
adept: gang solved crimes in knit
bell-bottoms. Not a show in itself,
the Bloodhound Gang was a seg-
ment of ‘3-2-1 Contact” on PBS
— the only channel my parents let
me watch for years.

Little House on the Prairie.

This wholesome program featured

Michael Landon as the versatile Pa
Ingalls: faithful father, tender hus-
band, carpenter, farmer, mentor,
sometime doctor and. town psy-
chologist. Nellie and her mom
were terrors but Almonso (aka
Manly) was amazing.
SEoday.ve have to deal with
eight hours a day of annoying Bob
SagetonAmerica’s Funniest Home
Videos and Urkel on Family Mat-
ters. No wonder we’re all so
stressed out! TV used to be relax-
ing but now it is just irritating. I
mean, how many times can they
show. the. Saved By The Bell in
Hawaii episode? I’ve had enough
of Kelly. Kapowski hula dancing!
Something must be done! Nomore

mamathen, mamiller,
mamunger, matucker, pagardne,

pahay, paschorb.

We also have some names that
are clearly throwbacks to an ear-
lier, less enlightened era, you know,
Me Tarzan, You Jane: meharris,
mekimmel, meovercash. . . . but
hebuckley.

And we have some names that
would look and sound right at home
in “Jabberwocky”: glindsey,
gwappley, ronorfle,and tonorwoo.
Speaking of high culture, what
about romorrow, and ronutt?

Who’s speaking here, the dog Astro
from the Jetsons?!? Rould roorike
aronutt? Rotrow, raybe romorrow.

There’s even information to
help our law enforcement commu-
nity, if only they'd follow the clues
right before their noses. I don’t
understand whats all the fuss about
the Unabomber and why the FBI
can’t track him down. He’s hiding
out right here on campus and call-
ing himself bomckill.

But the most valuable infor-
mation of all? The e-mail direc-
tory is a great place to look for a
date, Let’s see, here... You know,
just on a whim I'd like to go out
with someone named caprice. Or
how about kisanderson? That
sounds promising. Oops. I just
dropped my modem and it went
kaplank!

Keep looking, getting warmer.
Hmmm...I wonder what paperoni
likes on her pizza? What would -
you drink on a date with beervin?
Dry or ice? Red or white? Maybe
she wouldn't be able to make up
her mind. I guess Ill just break out

desherri.

Would aningram mix my
name up? Would I have a good
time or bad time with malinvil?
Sounds foreboding . . . I bet
shmalush would bea great date for
the Iditarod. Who knows? We
might get besnowde. Eureka!
alwright! Now, I'm getting hot. I
think I'll dial up /afoxx. Yeah,
that’s the ticket... Phooey! I just
dropped my coke and it went
phsprink! all over my leg. Maybe .
Vd better quit while I'm ahead - . ;

Habitat is about people

I walked into the small home
on Potts Street in Davidson unsure
of what to expect and was amazed
by what I saw. Beautiful plants
graced the corners of the room, a
fish tank murmured in the back-
ground, anda bird sang in its cage—
the scene seemed right out of Bet-
ter Homes & Gardens.

“I’ve always had a green
thumb,” Nina O’ Brian said, glanc-
ing at the foliage. “And green toes,
and greeneverything! I really.love
working with plants.”

~ She isanamazing woman who
stands up for her rights and sticks
to her guns. “My friends describe
me as ‘funky’ and ‘feisty.’ 1 am
definitely very independent,” she
admitted.

Nina certainly needs her
strength as she struggles to raise
her children, Amy and Nicholas,
as a single mother. - But her fight
was helped greatly by.a very spe-
cial program.

“They called me,” she remem-
bered. “A friend had told them
about our situation, and the board
members called and told me about
Habitat. Without the Habitat pro-
gram, it would have been virtually

impossible for me to buy a house

on my own.”
After a rigorous application
process, the family was accépted

as candidates. In May of 1991, the.

O’ Brians moved into a house spon-
sored by the Davidson affiliate of
Habitat for Humanity International.

“They didn’t give us anything

for free,” Nina emphasized. “We”

worked our butts off for this house,
which took almost a year to build.
It’s like my grandfather said: ‘I'll
help you if you’re willing to help
yourself.’ ”

Nina is noticeably excited
about the organization and hopes
more people find out about it.
“Everyone who doesn’t know
about it absolutely should get in-
volved in some way—you learn so
much from it,” she said. “It’s very
much a community effort.”

She is also glad about the Habi-
tat House Committee being formed
at Davidson College. “The college
kids really do influence the com-
munity. Except for taking up all of
the parking spaces downtown, the
students have a positive impact on
Davidson,” Nina said.

Her life has been very diffi-
cult, and from her experiences she

~ has gained her powerful will and

“Roseanne” attitude. Nina grew
up in Lynchburg, Virginia, later
moved to Florida and finally to
Davidson.

Through it all, Nina has
learned to stand up for herself and.
not let anyone treat her badly. One
can easily detect her strong char-
acter and will. She is a very open,
determined andcourageous woman ~

“attempting to survive as a single ©

mother, taking things day by day. .
She simply hopes for her children -
to grow up happy and healthy.
Nina, Amy and Nicholas O’ Brian
will continue pushing forward, with
some help from Habitat for Hu-
manity along the way.
