ACTION, from p. 4

istic society for those ruthless enough to
own it. But along the way to his goal he
enjoys his mistress Ashley (Vanity) and the
other miscellaneous fringe benefits of or-
ganized crime. Absolute power has left him
empty of humanemotion. His only pleasure
lies in his perversions. Dellaplane is an easy
man to hate.

Vanity also lives up to the audience’s
expectations of her. Having played in
Prince’s Purple Rain, one would not expect
her to act.. But, having appeared in this
month’s Playboy, one might expect a peek
at her sultry body, which, in fact, she makes
no bones about displaying before the cam-
eras. She has the silliest role, the most
absurd lines, and the talent of nearly paper-
trained Labrador retriever. But who cares?

“What do youcalla man with noarms and
no legs in a pile of leaves?”

“Russell.”

“What do youcallaman with noarmsand
no legs on a wall?” ,

“Art.”

What do you call a man with no arms and
no legs on the floor?”

“Mat.”

far short of inspiring any kind of admiration
for it. Action Jackson, as a stereotypical
action movie, does not have enough vio-
lence or enough car chases, although Van-
ity supplies the endeavo. with hooters ga-
lore. If Vanity is your fantasy, Action
Jackson is your movie.

and a lack of shyness needs not talent.

In all, the movie has some interesting
minor characters, which one might antici-

bring an air of authenticity and a spark of
vivacity in an otherwise trite and hack-
neyed film. And, in all honesty, some
moments do salvage this film from total
perdition.’ For instance, in one scene the

until his death, one of the premier figures in
American film comedy. This film is one of
his best.
