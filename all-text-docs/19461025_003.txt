at hand is the Hampden-Sydney eleven, who shouldn't be
much of a problem for the Cats, if they can get over
the fumble-itis and unsteadiness exhibited against V.M.1.

Playing host for the third time this season, David-

Springs eleven Friday afternoon at 3:00 on Richard-
son Field.

Knocking over their first {Wo opponents without much
trouble, the Kittens will try for a third win Friday, and
may meet a stiffer brand of opposition in the Barium

Kittens have thus far their

Lees-McRae was the first victim to feel the

ing scoreless while the JVees racked up 37 points.

The Kitten backfield is loaded with talent which has
given a good account of itself. Backs Bud Fowle and
Jack Elkins show tremendous power-in driving through

stop in the Abbey game and can be counted on to make
trouble for Barium Springs. Dave Edwin, Cliff Turner,
and Buck Troutman have also sparked in previous games

the line for consistant gains.

Up front, where the ball games are won and lost,
the Wildkittens are again well equipped. Preyer,
Bingham and Covington were the core of resistance
in the Abbey game and the rest of the stalwarts will
be gunning for action.

*FIGHTING SPIRIT

At this point | would like to digress a bit from the
hard and narrow path of sports and say a few words
about the apparent lack of spirit exhibited by the stu-
dent body at this year’s previous Davidson grid engage-
ments. In pre-war years, as every Old Davidson man
knows, there might have been a lack of wins. on the
final tally-card, but there was never a lack of spirit,
among the student body, nor among the field partici-
pants. Just last week when the Wildcats invaded V.M.1.
with a strong team and a good representation of students,
there was not a single Chéer Leader present to organize
the support and let the men¢on the field know that the
students and fans were there behiud them.

Halt of the color of a football. game consists of a
well organized cheering section, wholeheartedly support-
ing their team and cheering them on to victory. | make
this criticism constructively and offerthe following sug’
gestions. First: that cheer leaders and fans be present
at all Davidson games. Second: that Freshmen be re-
quired to sit 4ogether in a Freshman section, with caps,
and that organized support be demanded of not only
these Freshmen, but of every student in the student
body.
