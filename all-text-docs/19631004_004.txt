THE DAVIDSONIAN

ON PARENTS DAY

Freshman Actors Present
Victorian Comic Sketches

BY DAVID COFFEY
The first drama workshop of the year, a project of|

the Vagabonds, Davidson College’s dramatics group. will
present a two-part program. Why Do You Laugh, Albert?
—Comic Sketches of the Victorian Era, on Saturday, Oct.

19, as part of Freshmen Parents Day.

Two of the comedy sketches

resented, “Box and Cox” and
“Horatio Sparkins.” will be act-
ed and produced entirely by
(freshmen, A brief scene from
the upcoming major Vagabond
production, The Importance of
Being Earnest, may possibly be
presented also.

“Box and Cox,” written by
John Madison Morton in 1641,
‘was one of the first plays to use
the standard comedy situation of
two people renting the same
room, each without the know-
ledge of the other's presence. In
this play, Mr. Box, portrayed by
Fred Gordon, and Mr. Cox, por-
trayed by Joe Obenshain, are
the renters. The role of Mrs.
Bouncer, the landlady, will be
filed by Miss Anne Shannon
Cumming of the biology depart-
ment.

“Horatio Sparkins,” the sec
ond selection, was adapted by
Rupert T. Barber, Jr., new di-
rector of dramatics, from an
early Charles Dickens’ short
story. Although this early work
does not carry the social im-
port to be found in Dickens’
later writings, it shows a young
writer experimenting with basic
character types that would later
become standard in his novels.

The role of the narrator in
“Horatio Sparkins” will be fill-
ed by Romir Chatterjee, Rich-
ardson Scholar from India. Chat-
terjee has had much experience
in drama with a Bombay theatre
group. Others performing in this
play will be Clark Laster, Ed
Dwelle and Bruce Gregory.

Lighting and sound for the
freshman workshop will be ‘un-
der the direction of Brooks Shel-
don and Richard Barney. Bob

This workshup will be the first
in a projected series of work-
shops which, Barber hopes, may
be held as frequently as one
every three weeks. It was decid-
ed to devote this first workshop
entirely to freshman talent since
so many freshmen showed an in-
terest in dramatics at the Acti-
vities Fair held during Orienta-
tion Week.

However, in the future, the
participation of all interested
students will be welcomed. “The
workshop program should have
a place for anyone with interests
in the theatre. It will fail unless
students let their interests be
shown to me,” Barber stated.
He expressed a special need for
student directors for the work-
Shop plays. “Anyone interested
in becoming a student director
should see me aS soon as pos-
sible,” he said.

Barber reports that the next
regular Vagabond production,
The Importance of Being Ear-
nest, to be presented from Oct.
30 to Nov. 2, is well into produc-
tion. However, the important
role of the dashing young Jack
has yet to the cast. Anyone in-
terested. in trying out for this
role should see Barber immed-
iately. .

Seven 1963 Graduates
Get Scholastic Awards

BY TOM ANDERSON

Seven Davidson graduates of
1963 received national competi-
tive scholarships Jast year. Ap-
proximately 20 graduates accept-
ed departmental fellowships
ranging in value from $1000 to
$2,500.

In its history, Davidson has
numbered 12 Rhodes Scholars
among its students. Davidson is
tied with Pomona College of

the number of Rockefeller
Brothers fellowships awarded to
its graduates. Students of no
other college in the Southeast
have received as many Woodrow
Wilson scholarships as have
those of Davidson.

So that students will be able
to take advantage of these a-
wards, Dr. George L. Abernethy,
chairman of the faculty com-
mittee on graduate scholarships,
urges interested students to ap-

California for fourth place in ply early.

Abernethy recommends that

national competitive scholar-
ships should take the Graduate
Record Examinations in Novem-

The minimum academic re-
quirement for the Rhodes,
Marshall, Danforth and Rocke-

usually is a B plus average,
while B is the common mini-

2 \Sport Events’ Beanie-Grabs
Add Extra Status Symbols

Four new status symbols are bobbing around the campus on the heads of am-

bitious freshmen.

The first of these symbols to make its appearance was the familiar red and black

beanie bearing the big, black “D” and pro
unforseen casualties such as writs, reviews,

claiming that four years hence, barring
and exams, in 1967 the wearer will be a

\full-fledged alumnus of Davidson College. No ,self-respecting freshman would be

zaught on campus without one.

_ In addition to the old standby,
several other assorted combina-
| tions of colors have made their
| appearance as material results
of three beanie-grabs.

' Last Tuesday’s soccer game
was the sight of the most excit-
ing episode in the beanie war.
The banked sides of the field
were to become the sight of sev-
‘eral rather protracted battles

Barth Authority
Vespers Speaker

Dr. Shirley Guthrie, an au-
thority on the theology of Karl
Barth and professor of theology
at Columbia Theological Sem-
inary in Decatur, Ga., will speak
at the vesper service Sunday
night and in chapel on Monday
morning.

over possession of headgear. One
Belmont Abbey freshman and
one Davidson freshman decided
to enjoy close company with
each other as they rolled around
yelling. A crowd soon gathered
to watch the festivities.

The crowd was of a changing
nature. Freshmen ignorant
enough to leave their beanies on
found someone quick to remove
them.

The first beanie to make an
illegitimate appearance on
campus was the purple counter-
part from Furman University.
It seems that at a recent athletic
contest the more ambitious of
Davidson’s freshmen decided to
collect as many beanies as Fur-
man scored points.

In setting out to capture Fur-
man bonnets, the aspiring ones
met with certain obstacles. It
seems that most freshmen have

caps. The wet weather that
marked the Furman game pro-
duced abundant red mud, as one
prospective beanie - snatcher
found out when he was corner-
ed by 17 Furman freshmen. An-
other found that beanies con-
ceal hidden weapons. A well-
placed tack can foil most at-
tempts for a fast getaway.

Catawba freshmen also found
out that Davidson freshmen
were pretty hep about getting
beanies.

So Davidson now has four
freshman status symbols to pro-
tect clean-cut heads for ROTC
drill.

For “townies” Davidson bean-
ies come at a premium. One
freshman relates his experience
thusly. “I was approached by a
young man about town who ask-
ed directions to the library. As
I naively turned to point it out,

At the University of Basel,| a reluctance to part with their I was decapitated of my beanie.”

Switzerland, Dr. Guthrie studied
under Barth, a leading contem-
porary theologian, and received.
his PhD. Next year his transla-
tion of Barth's Commentary on
the Heidleberg Catechism will
be published.

Dr. Guthrie was born Oct. 9,
1927, im Navasota, Tex., the son
of a Presbyterian minister. After
serving two years in the US.
Army, he entered Austin Col-
lege in Sherman, Tex., where
he received his AB degree in
1949. He received his BD from
Princeton Seminary in 1952.

Dr. Guthrie is the author of
The Theological Character of
Reinhold Neibuhrs’ Social Ethics
and has translated Oscar Cull-
man’s The Christology of the
New Testament.

Chaplain Will Terry has an-
nouned that Dr. Guthrie will
lead an informal discussion in
the student lounge of the col-
lege church after the vesper)
: service Sunday. His sermon topic
will be “Something Better than
Christianity.”

logy of Karl Barth” on Monday

Progress takes many shapes in the Bell System. And among
the shapers are young men, not unlike yourself, impatient

There are few places where such restlessness is more wel-

WORDS: THEIR CAUSE AND CURE

Today let us take up the subject of etymology (or entomology,
as it is sometimes called) which is the study of word origins
(or insects, as they are sometimes called).

_ Where are word origins (insects) to be found? Well sir, some-
times words are proper names which have passed into the
language. Take, for instance, the words used in electricity:
ampere was named after ite discoverer, the Frenchman Andre
Marie Ampere (1775-1836); similarly, ohm wos named after
the German GS. Ohm (1781-1854), watt after the Soot James
Watt (1736-1819), and bulb after the American Fred C. Bulb
(1843-1912).

There is, incidenfally, quite a poignant little story about
Mr. Bulb. Until Bulb’s invention, all illumination was pro-
vided by gas, which was named after ite inventor Milton T. Gas

who, strange to tell, had been Bulb’s roommate at Cal Tech!
In fact, strange to tell, the third man sharing the room with
Bulb and Gas was also one whose name burns bright in the
annals of illumination— Walter Candle!

The three roommates were inseparable companions in col-
lege. After graduation all three did research in the problems
of artificial light, which at this time did not exist. All America
used to go to bed with the chickens, and many fine citizens were,
alas, severely injured falling off the roost.

Well sir, the three comrades—Bulb, Gas, and Candle—
promised to be friends forever when they left school, but
success, alas, spoiled all that. First Candle invented the can-
die, got rich, and forgot his old friends. Then Gas invented gas,
got rich, bankrupted Candle, and forgot his old friends. Then
Bulb invented the bulb, got rich, bankrupted Gas, and forgot
his old friends.

Candle and Gas, bitter and impoverished at the ages respeo-
tively of 75 and 71, went to sea as respectively the world’s
oldest and second oldest cabin boy. Bulb, rich and grand, also
went to sea, but he went im etylo—as a first-class passenger on
luxury liners.

Well sir, ctrange to tell, all three were aboard the ill-fated
Lusitania when she was sunk in the North Atlantie. And
strange to tell, when they were swimming for their lives after
the shipwreck, all three clambered aboard the same dinghy!

Well cir, chastened and made wiser by their brush with peril,
they fell into each other's arms and wept and exchanged for-
giveness and became fast friends all over again.

For three years they drifted in the dinghy, ehaking hands
and singing the Cal Tech rouser all the while. Then, at long
last, they spied a passing liner and wore taken aboard.

They remained fast friends for the rest of their days, which,
I regret to report, were not many, because the liner which picked
them up was the Titanic.

What a pity that Marlboros were not invented during tho
lifetimes of Bulb, Gas, and Candie. Had there been Mar'boros,
these three friends never would have grown apart because they
would have realized how much, despite their differences, they
otf had in common. I mean toesy that Marlborce can be lit by
candle, by gne, and by electricity, and no matter how you
light them, you always get a lot to Hhe—a filter, a flavor, a
pack or box that makes enyone—ineloding Bulb, Ges, end Oan-
