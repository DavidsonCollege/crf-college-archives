Area retirement community takes shape

By EDITH PARKER
and HOWARD BROWNE
Staff Writers

Plans are continuing for the
development of a Davidson
retirement community that
would be open to all interested
alumni and friends of Davidson
College.

The community, which will
be located on the McConnell

Farm now owned by Davidson ©

College, is, according to a local

honor of four generations of the

Vail family, prominent friends
of the College, to whom they
had been very close.

A member of the youngest
generation, James D. Vail IV,
graduated from Davidson in
1976, the same year in which his
parents, Mr. and Mrs. James
D. Vail HI, served as co-chair-
men of Davidson’s Parents
Council.

Bernard, with Bachelor's and
Ph.D. degrees from the Univer-
sity of Virginia, taught at Yale
University before coming to
Davidson in 1955. He became a
full professor here in 1959, and
was chairman of the mathema-
tics department for a number of
years until he resigned the post
last year.

He has been a member of the
Davidson Lions Club and elder
of the Davidson College Presby-
terian Church.

Academic Vice President
Price Zimmermann praised him
‘‘a demanding yet conpas-
sionate teacher, with a keen
sense of humor, a forthright
manner, and a conservative
“temperament.”

spokesman, “the culmination of
several years’ study by David-
son residents, including a num-
ber of retirees, who wish to
continue living in the town but
realize that they will need
increased care as they get
older.”

At meetings held July 19 in
Davidson and Charlotte, ap-
proximately one hundred and
fifty residents expressed inter-
est in the community, which
will be built in the western
corner of the farm.

The remainder of the farm

will be developed for faculty and
staff housing.

Chester Prentice, director of
Highland Farms, an investor--
owned community in Black
Mountain, N.C., is in charge of
studies for the project. Prentice

is currently consulting with
architects concerning estimates
and ideas for the community.

If the project is found to be
feasible, a corporation will be
formed to buy the land from the
college and to set up the
community.

Although the land will be
bought from the college, the
college’s involvement will end
there. College Business Mana-
ger Robert Currie explained,
“The retirement community
will be a completely separate
operation from Davidson Col-
lege.’”

According to a survey form

appearing in the July Davidson
Update, current plans call for

desired, and recreational and
entertainment facilities.

‘In addition to the apart-
ments and smaller. rooms, some
small houses similar to town-
houses may be built in clus-
ters,”’ the plans continue.

“Unlike the smaller units, the
houses would be occupant-
owned, but would be sold back
to the corporation when the
owner is unable or chooses not
to remain there.”’

The project will be financed
by North Carolina investors
who will receive a slight return
on their investment.

Cost for dwellers will range
from $5000 entry fee plus $265
monthly fee for apartments to
$56,000 for three bedroom clus-
ter houses.

..Students’
role ‘risky’

“I don’t want to be placed in
the position of defending this in
any ultiniate way. Any number
of groups, I’m sure, would have
done just as well. It was a
matter of convenience,”’ said
Melton.

He said that the entire school
has had an. opportunity to talk
to the trustees at almost all
their past meetings, but that

-few people use.the opportunity.

“At nearly.every Trustee
meeting there has been a time
for students to communicate
with Trustees. From my obser-
vation, they are always poorly
attended and I’ve never heard
very much of. substance dis-
cussed at them. I usually try to
go because it’s sort of embar-
rassing few ‘few people are
there,’’ said Melton.

‘He emphasized that this was

not a regular Trustee Business
Meeting,-but was instead a
special meeting devoted entirely
to the 1987 program. “It was,.
as one Trustee said, a ‘sales
meeting,’ "’ according to Mel.

ton. -
Melton said that it might be

considered ‘‘risky'’ to allow
students to carry on unstruc-
tured one-to-one conversations,
such as the Friday interviews,
during a fund-raising meeting,
but that it was College Presi-
dent Samuel Spencer's idea not
to give the Trustees ‘‘a canned
presentation. "

“If you think it’s all right
for the College to go under, then
you don't need anybody giving
money to it. But Davidson
College is completely dependent
on voluntary support,’’ said
Melton.
