Roll ‘Em, Andy!

Andy was having a quiet ‘tittle game
down the alley, and the following was
overheard: .

Andy—“Ford dem bones, nigger, Ford
dem bones.”

Player—“What you mean, Ford dem
bones?”

Andy—“Shake, rattle, and roll.’

At the Trough
Miss Mapietta had a hen;
She thought that she would set her;
But feed went up and up and up,
And so Miss Marietta.

Now, Pat!

Pat Miller and Doc Beatty were walk-
ing on the campus at-night. Doc togked
to the sky and remarked:

“How bright Orion is ronight.”

“So that is O’Ryan, is it?” said Pat.
“Well, I'm glad there is one Irishman in
heaven anyway!”

Joe's Real Name.

Joe McCaskill was working in a rail-
road yard last summer dowa in S. C.
One morning on answering the phone
the question came, “Is that cight-six-
one-five-nine?”

“Aw, g’wan!” said Joe. “What do you
think Iam, a box car?”

High Flyers.
First Moth—"Oh, I’m so tired this
morning,”
Second Moth—“Up late last night?”

First Moth—“Yes, I was at a camphor
ball.”

Record Time.

Victrolas to right of ‘em,
Victrolas to left of 'em,
Victrolas behind ‘em

Smote and then thundered;
Ragtime that pierced the sky,
Grand opera pitched too high,
And not a single lull-a-by

In records six hundred.

Rush ‘Em Up.

Sam Story was hired as a painter last
summer. The foreman found him paint-
ing very rapidly one day and asked why
the unusual hurry.

“Well,” said Sam, “the paint’s getting
low and I want to get through before it
gives out.” :

Speaking about college magazines,
Eris Cassell, ex-Rock Hill, S. C, in-
forms us that the Winthrop Journal has
made its appearance and that his girl
has “A Poem” on page 57.—Becky from
Babylon.

What's the use of living
Isn’t any aim.

What's the use of thinking
It’s only pain.

What's the use of kissing
He'd only tell.

What's the use of living
OH well.

R. Jones—How is the police force get-
ting along in your town?

Bob McLeod—He jis doing nicely,
thank you.

Groves—What you have just said is a
pun
Joe—Upon whom?

Spat—Say Pat, have you a cigarette?
Pat C—Yes, plenty, thank you.

The Lurid Leper.

The authorship of “The Lurid Leper,”
a copy of which is given below, is
ascribed to Dr. James Addison Alex-
ander, a son of the first president of
Hampden-Sidney College, Dr. Archibald
Alexander. Dr. J. A. Alexander was a
very brilliant linguist, and had a habit
of “talking without thinking” at times
for the amusement of the young people
with whom he came in contact. The
selection to follow is said to be one of
his productions which happened to be
copied down at the time and passed
around among some of his friends. It is
a ridiculous conglomeration of unusual |
words, and will well repay a careful
reading. Mr. M. W. Venable, now of
Charleston, W. Va., memorized this
piece more than sixty years ago, and it
is his quotation that will be presented.

|e Peanut Parcher |

THE LURID LEPER
In that-spasmodic region where mankind
Was deeply synchronous and vaguely
blind,
Where elemental anodynes prevail
And Stygian carols ventilate the sail;
Where man is analyzed and nature’s
voice
Bids esotheric fallacies rejoice.

In that far distant soporific land

There dwelt an adipose erratic band,

Whose crimson verdicts and whose
bland petards;

Whose synalephas and Aelaic guards,

Whose imbeciles and whose chevaliers

Annulled and sacrificed for many years.

At length a “leper” of laconic form
Appeared sophisticated on a storm;
His eyes mellifiluous, his nose malign,
His lurid color villified the Rhine;
While on his brow a sudorific sneer
Of caligraphic anguish did appear.

On either side of his Savannah ran

A tall narcotic evanescent man,

And all around a cloud of granite spread

White as a coal and as a lily red.

From this a Salamander floated in,

And stood where once a terebinth had
been;

Paused for a moment, shook his amber
mane,

Rushed upon the leper—vain.

Were his efforts to propel the pang,

His bones were crumbled ‘neath that
murderous fang..

He shrieked, he sympathized, he vainly
tried

To draw an inference with ghastly pride.

And thus without a groan the “Lurid
Leper" died;

And o’er his grave a ghastly catecomb

Rises like Chimborazo over Rome.

Hither the Pilgrim in his fell canoe

IMludes the gnomon and his wild halloo;

And as he villifies his deep career,

In which a panuply of tyhts appear;

Pursues Pygmalion in his lambent cars,

Dissects the universe and dethrones the
stars; ‘

Assails the Carmine, then ascends the
Alps

And builds a wigwam of a thousand
scalps.

More of thy history I need not tell,

But bid the “Lurid Leper" farewell.

GREAT TIME ENJOYED BY ALL
PASSENGERS ON WILDCAT
SPECIAL.

“Hail, hail, the gang's all here,

What the——All aboard, train for
Davidson.”

The Wildcat Limited was under way
with friend Abernathy presiding. Nor
was all the fun a thing of the past as the
eminent composer, Prof. Culbreth, led us
in singing, the only bad feature of which
was the high and shrill voice of the
well-known jazzer, Ormand. After the
first act of this performance, McLeod
and McLeod took charge of the destinies
of all those present by organizing their
Smoky Nine of rope chewers. They were
ably assisted in their performance by
Story, with his John, Jr., at first, and
little Willie Carr plus a Virginia Cheroot
at short, while the rest of the team acted
their parts well until Prof. Culbreth had
a mishap with his stogy and had to re-
trie from the game. As all available
Cigars were in use at the time, the game
was called off because of the lack of am-
munition.

Those who had not been able to mus-
ter the required cash for the venture, or
who did not want to part with it, had
the pleasure of riding the top of the
caboose and some were fortunate
enough to get by with it. Names sup-
pressed. :

Cigars and voices both having given
out, the rest of the journey was looking
rather dismal when the Ford on the
front of our line of parlor cars blew for
home. At this juncture, someone asked
Handsome Hamer which end of the
train he wanted to get off. This youth
lcoked very surprised and asked:

“Don’t both ends stop?”

“All out for Davidson” howled super-
intendent Baba and our holiday was at
a close,
