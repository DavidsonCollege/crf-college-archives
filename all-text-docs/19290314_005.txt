SIX BASKETEERS WIN LETTERS

CAT TRAX

As They Follow the Red and
Black

By Zeb V. Long, Jr.

Crown ’em and admit. Those Red
Terrors certainly came through with
a big bang. Now they’re back having
their pictures snapped with Governor
Gardner and so on, and everybody is
happy. It was almost a Carolina Tour-
nament. We are sort of sorry the
Blue Devils couldn’t win, since David-
son had put it on the Durham lads
earlier in the season, but out heart-
iest congratulations go out to Coach
Gus Tebell and every man on the
Wolfpack team.

Thoughts of most young men
around here are swiftly turning to
baseball now. The Wildcats are
beginning to look like a ball club.
If they just get those eyes on the
ball you are going to see a danger-
ous nine take the field against the
Oak Ridge Cadets next Friday.
It will mean a lot to grab off this
first one. Help the team. get that
winning spirit.

The infield presents a big problem to
Younger. Looks like Littlejohn has
short sewed up, and Crawford is fair-
ly certain to hold down the initial
sack. The-‘other two positions are de-
batable though. Bill Marks may get
the hot corner, while Jim Procter and
Bill Goodson fight it out for the key-
stone. Procter, especially is a hard
hitter, and it will be hard to keep him
off the first string.

Nab Armfield and “Happy”
Gladstone are having a real scrap
for the job back of the plate.
Gladstone made most of the trips
last year, and boasts some expe-
rience, while it is Armfield’s first
crack at the varsity. N ab
smacked ’em out on the rat nine
last spring and showed a pretty
good arm. He should go good this

time.

We hope the frosh can get togeth-
er and ‘show a capable team. “Tex's”
call will bring them running to the
lower field, and the student body will
wait anxiously to pass judgment on the
new diamond men. Can’t get too much
material on hand, because men are al-
ways dropping out, and we land up
with less than we thought. It’s a
mighty good feeling to know that a
strong freshman team is coming up to
reinforce the varsity.

How about the new requirement
of fifteen points to win a track
letter? Means lots harder work
and fewer letters, but it may mean

‘\better teams. The Wildcats are
something of an enigma on the
cinders this spring. Excellent
material for the short runs and fair
prospects in the field events, but
those long runs are likely to prove
cause for downfall again.

Over at Carolina they are bemoan-
ing the loss of Galen Elliot and Hoyt
Pritchett, premier distance runners of
the South. We are pretty sure that
the Tar Heels won't be lacking much
in the track line when the first gun
barks. They've got too much ma-
terial out over there not to put out a
cracking good squad. Same is true at
Duke. State usually rates along with
Davidson while Wake tags
along the rear.

Forest

Tennis players begin to show in-
terest in the game these warm
balmy afternoons. With three let-
ter men back, and the sophomore
hopes, Davidson should have an-
other good year. It’s seldom that
the Wildcat Tennis Team isn’t a
whang.

In twenty-four hours, it is said, one
silk-worm will produce material for a
woman’s complete outfit. Silkworms,
we fear, are getting lazier and lazier,
says the Springfield Union.

A class» was asked in a Sunday
School examination to give the mean-
ing of the word “Selah.” For a while
no answer was forthcoming. . Then a
small boy diffidently held up his hand.

“Well?” said the examiner, hope-
fully.

“Please, sir,” said the lad, “that’s
what David used to say whenever he
broke one of the strings on his harp!”

BASKETBALL TEAM

houn, Goodson and Crawford

It was recently announced that the
following men were to be awarded the
Varsity “D” for service on the Basket

Carl Pritchett, ’30, Captain, of Reids-
ville, -N. C., received his second letter

Seniors Win Volley
Ball Championship

Sophs Defeated in Final Game

to Give Seniors Title

After three big days of volley ball last
week the Seniors clinched the intramural
volley ball championship by a win from
the Sophomores.

The game, which was first introduced
at Davidson last fall, is played by two
teams of six men each on a regulation
size court. The necessary equipment con-
sists of a ball, somewhat similar to a bas-
ketball, and a net strung across the court
like a tennis net. The teams arrange
themselves on each side of the court and
one man serves the ball bv striking it
sharply ‘with his hand. The object is
for each team to return the ball every
time it comes across the net without al-
lowing it to touch the ground. Gatnes
of fifteen»points each were played; one
team being declared the winner upon
capturing two out of three games.

The Seniors defeated teams from all
three of the under classes to win first
place in the tournament. Among those
starring for the Seniors may he men-
tioned Gilmour and Robbins whose work
was outstanding.

The Sophomores took secend place in
the tournament by winning from the
Juniors and Freshmen and losing to the
Seniors. Munroe, Pridgen, and Williams
were the stars for the Sophs.

The Freshmen were unable to cop a
single, losing a fast one to the Juniors
in their final match.

KITTENS BEGIN DIAMOND
WORK

Fresh Turn Out For First Prac-

tice of Season

On Monday March 11th, the first Fresh
baseball practice was held. The after-
noon was devoted mainly to practice in
batting, knocking out flies, Very
little infield practice was carried on,
About twenty or thirty men were out,
but not in uniform. Twenty-four signed
up for their first and second choices or
positions, seven signing up for pitching
and six for catching. A few men are as

| yet unable to be out on account of Spring

Football practice.

It is almost impossible to judge this
early in the season just what the pros-
pects are. A few men however, showed
signs of good form. Professors Blythe
and Kimbrough are temporarily carrying
on the coaching until Coach Tilson or

Varsity Nine Begins
Training In Earnest

Wildcats to be Especially Strong
in Hurlers for Coming Season

Monk Younger is rapidly rounding into
shape his 1929 baseball team for their in-
itial tilt with the Oak Ridge Institute
Cadets on March 22, The menu for the
last few days has consisted of bunting,
sliding, and hitting drills for the candi-
dates, but Coach Younger announces that
some real baseball is on deck for the
players within the next few days. The
annual high school track meet, here on
the twenty-third limits the Wildcats and
the Cadets to one game in place of the
annual two-tilt series between the two
nines.

During the past week, the Wildcat dia-
mond candidates were sent through such
rapid paces that the outline of the team
is fast beginning to take form. Armfield
and Bradstone are the best bets for catch-
er at present. DeCamp, substitute back-
stop on last year’s nine has given up his
diamond activities in favor of tennis. The
Davidson nine will be exceptionally strong
on hurlers this year. Meadows and Mc-
Innis of last year’s pitching staff and
“Buck” Marrow from the Freshmai out-
fit have all shown rare form in early sea-
son drills, Thompson, the only left-hand-
ed twirler on the squad has not been in
the proper condition because of an arm
injury, while J. R. Marks has been so
far unable to develop much control due
to a hurt finger. Crawford will most
likely hold down first base with Good-
son, first baseman from last year's frosh
outfit, shifted to the key stone bag’ to
replace Proctor whose services will be
seen in right field this year. Littlejohn
has been working in snappy form at short-
stop while S. C. Marks looks good for
the team’s third baseman. Hal Johnson's
center field berth will be occupied by Cap-
tain Ratchford with “Whiz” Miller hand-
ling flies in the left field position vacated
by Ratchford.

Rude
home!

Listener: “Shut up and go
I wouldn't vote for you—I'd

rather vote for the devil.”

Polite Candidate: “All right, but
suppose your friend isn’t running.”

INITIAL GAME OF
SPRING FOOTBALL
GOES TO “REDS”

“Blacks’ Defeated When De-
Camp Recovers Blocked Punt
for “Red’s” Score

“A block punt which rolled behind their
opponents’ goal, and was recovered by a
pile of “Red” gridiron warriors gave the
“Reds” a 6 to 0 victory over the “Blacks”
last Saturday afternoon. This was the
first of a series of games played during
spring football practice. There was quite
a large crowd of students out to witness
the melee.

The game as a whole was drab and un-
interesting. Neither team could do much
in offensive way and only a few passes
were attempted.

For the Reds, Parrish showed a world
of drive at times and was continually
smashing off tackle to gain a few yards.
McQueen showed up pretty good until
he was sent out of the game with an
injury. J. Bradshaw carried the ball
with much success at times, he and Par-
rish doing most of the ball-toting for the
victors.

N. Bradshaw and Fraley were the out-
Standing stars for the losers. Fraley
looked good backing up the line and
Bradshaw did most of the offensive work
during the first half. Goodykontz show-
ed some of his old-time form in running.
Milton and Lillard were very good in the
line.

The Reds led in first downs, getting
six to their opponents’ two.
