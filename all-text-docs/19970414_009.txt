OPINIONS

It’s that time of year again.
Grab your No. 2 pencils, course
guides, those silly complicated “tree
things,” and getcompletely psyched
about registering for all those classes
you will eventually regret having
signed up for. The experience is
always exciting, or at least the Reg-
istrar tries to make it so. Hasn’t
there been some sort of scheduling
foul-up at that office for like the
past 27 semesters?

The blame seems to always land
on the computer — an easy scape-
goat because it has no feelings — or
does it? And then there’s this 892-
CATS line thing, which tests the
patience of all human beings. I
mean this tedious process is so irri-
tating that I want to ‘just plain
strangle the lady whose voice ap-
pears on the recorder. It’s almost as
annoying as when you are checking
. your voice mail and mistakingly
press the wrong key, after which
you are rudely disconnected by that
Octel lady’s unpleasant, entirely
mocking “Goodbye.”

I need to apologize to the
Registrar’s office for any offensive
comments. This Opinions article is
actually an appeal to them, soI need
to offer my condolences before I
continue.

My problem is this. Every year
I get pumped up about all the cool
classes 1 arn going to be taking. Ido
all the nécessary background checks
with my friends. You know, stuff

like: are there pop quizzes? Is there
afinal? Can you eat during lecture?
Do you have to go to class? Ques-
tions like that. So from the begin-
ning I think have gotthings worked

out perfectly. I have no 8:30s, the’

best/easiest professors, and achance
to escape without having a single
exam at the end of the semester. In
other words, I am feeling pretty
good aboutmy academic future right
before I walk into my classes that
first day.

You see this is

eager student who thinks class is a
freakin’ game show. However, he
or she is not provided with a buzzer,
so he or she ends up using their arm
instead. Actually, a few more an-
noying sufferers tend to ignore any
sense of decency and just blurt out
the answers to any and all ques-
tions. Professors don’t even like
these people. It would be more
exciting to read an almanac.

Usually, but not always, they are
political science students who have

they are taking a class which they
found somewhat intriguing. These
people tend to be abit single-minded
in their comments. No matter what

conviction to relate whatever is be-
ing discussed in terms of the Marx-

All of us have been subjected
to this: You'll realize it sooner or

there are some people you just can’t

staring at you and making odd faces.
When the class circles up for dis-
cussion, they suddenly endupcloser
to you than the last time. As the
semester continues, they will slowly
creep around the circle but at the
same time doing it so that you are
fully aware of the situation and “the
chase.” Their looks eventually be-
come repulsive,and you spend most
élass time trying to avoid their dis-
concerting eyes rather than paying
attention or taking notes.

many of these you
might find in your classes. Basi-
cally, they are just dirty idiots. They

they don’t read a single thing the
whole semester. Nothing. Some-
times they don’t bring a single thing
toclass. When they arecalled upon,
they stumble across some terrible
answer, and the entire room giggles

think this is bad, but it’s not the end.

Eventually, you will have mid-
terms and you happen to see on his
crumpled paper that he got an “A,”
when you yourself gota“C.” Noth-
ing will make you angrier. It turns
out these people are really smart
and that they pretend to be worth-
less when they are in fact smarter
than you will ever be.

So now I have given a few
examples of the people you might
encounter the moment you walk
into that classroom. The solution, I
tell you, is quite simple. The Reg-
istrar should give you a list of all the
people that have signed up for the
classes you intend to take. That
way you can scroll through the list
of names in order to decide if you
want to take the class.

Actually, I think it would be
best for the Registrar to give us a
full bio on every student in the .
classes we want toregister for. You
know, a file that includes various
habits and behaviors, like “continu-
ally falls asleep in class and drools”.
or “has a tendency to disrupt class
once a twice a week by getting up to
use the restroom.” ;

This method, in all its brilliance,
will certainly cure any further dis-
appointments. I therefore encour-
age you to-do something. I don’t
know, form an ad-hoc committee
and pretend you are really impor-
tant. Whatever it is, make a differ-
ence. Itdoesn’t have to be this way.

Breaking Down Stereotypes

There were other changes that
[had not counted on. For instance,
in Pakistan, it was easy to pray five
times a day. The call to prayer
issued forth from the mosque, and
everyone stopped’ what they were
doing to pray swiftly. Here, withno
such reminder, it was hard to judge
the time of prayer. And of course,
in Pakistan, everyone could point
out the direction of Mecca. Here, I

. needed to use a special prayer-mat

that included a compass to figure it
out.
And then there was the fast

burger. It seemed suspicious. How
could a HAMburger plausibly
claim to have no ham in it? Was
Brian kidding when he warned me
against his brownies onthe grounds
that they contained raw pork hide?
What about Jon and his ice cream
(“Garcia’s ham swirl”)?

Perhaps the only genuinely
unpleasant part, though, was the
view of my religion as violent or
bloodthirsty. It was painful not
only because of its negative na-
ture, but because the gun-toting

What’s the Problem?

While reading the sports page
of The Davidsonian last week, my
eyes bulged in disbelief at Mike
Kruse’s interpretation of Marshall
Tyler’s performance in the three-
game set against Marshall.

Kruse described Tyleras a “sel-
dom-used outfielder” that played
the role of the “unlikely hero.”

First of all, Kruse completely
disrespected Tyler’ s talent and hard-
earned skills. He portrayed Tyler as

some bum off the street that won the ~

lottery, when in fact Tyler is out
there every day practicing and re-
fining his skills so that when it was
his turn to bat, he could provide for
the team.

Idon’t understand why a school
paper isn’t biased toward the home
team, why it doesn’t portray our
athletes as heroes, or why it can’t
give them the respect that they de-
serve.

Kruse didn’t have to word the
article so Tyler looked like a scrub.
Heck, he didn’t even have to men-
tion his previous playing time, es-
pecially if it was belittling. I’m
suprised Kruse didn’t list all the
guys that didn’t play or everybody
that struck out.

Why couldn’t he just say,
“sophomore Marshall Tyler hit a 2-
run homer and also singled to drive
in the winning run against
Marshall.” He wouldn’t even have
tomention Tyler’s obvious strength
for ripping the ball into deep center,
his cool nerves that allowed him to

aeeeewe

provide for his team and his school
in the clutch, or in Tyler’s chance at
being the starting keeper next year
for the soccer team.

Kruse, it’s your duty not only
to inform the public but to posi-
tively portray your school and its
athletes, who endure Davidson’s
rigorous academic challenges and
spend three or more hours everyday
practicing their sport. Why not give
them the respect and honor that they
deserve? —

Iasked Tyler about his feelings

toward the article, and he modestly
replied, “It was just nice to get my
name mentioned.” I think he de-
served a full-page article or at least
an interview on his outstanding per-
formance with the whole school,
and everything it represents, riding
on his back.
- But instead, we get the uncar-
ing and unschool-spirited descrip-
tion of his performance that could
probably be found in The Charlotte
Observer.

I would like to remind Kruse
that he actually goes to the same
school as: Marshall Tyler. That’s
right, he’s the guy you hope might
glance at you when he passes by in
the hall because he’s cooler than
you could ever dream of being. He
hit a homerun not in some backyard
pickup game but in a college base-
ball game. He alsocame through in
the clutch and drove in the winning
run in a game you could only watch
