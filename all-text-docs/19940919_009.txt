A rush guide

The rush season is upon us like
flies on horse poop and you know
what that means: frat guy
wannabees all over the place. You
know the type—spends every
Monday night at the Pub trying to
figure out if those two guys talking
to that SAE are also Hods orif they
are KAsorFIJIs. They wantto talk
to girls, but what if some frat guy is
going out with her and he doesn’t
find out until after he hooks up
with her. (Well, actually freshmen
do not hook up, but they think
about it ... a lot ... a whole lot.)
First and foremost, I think we
should get into a discussion of what
a fraternity is. Some would tell
you that they are designed to build
leadership qualities in their mem-
bers. They are a place where men
can join together to further the
good causes of the world: fighting
muscular dystrophy, fighting hun-
ger, fighting drunk driving, and so
forth. All of these people are liars.
A fraternity is a place to get drunk
with the same 60 people every
single time you go out, plain and
simple.
So here is a one or two sen-
tence summary of eachhouse. ~
Sig Ep Affectionately know
as Spee, these guys love nicknames
like Bobo and are pretty much des-
tined to sell insurance in Topeka.
PiKA Affectionately known
as “the Union with beer.” Pretty
much destined to’move'‘to'a place
like Telluride, Colorado. After all,
as Don Henley says, “They hide it
up in Telluride.”
Kappa Sig They really like
country music. (It is probably not
fair to the Squids’ rush efforts to
reveal this.)

KA “provides much of the

total social activity for the entire
school.” Also provides much of
the ego for the entire school.

BSC Un, they have a really
cool pool table.

FIJI Well, you have to ride
something called “the Phi Gam
Tram” to get there, which is a little
embarrassing.

Phi Delt That’s a really neat
bench. You have to be very smart
to join Phi Delt.

SAE The closer you live to
Davidson, the better. “If we lose
our house we can always party at
mom and dad’s.”

_ I would tell you hot babes
about the women’s houses, but to
be honest, there really isn’t much
difference between them. It kind
of depends on what type of food
you like, I guess. I will say, though,
that Warner Hall has a good porch.
Connor used to be Spencer. And
Rusk, well, “husky Rusky all the
way.”

So, by the time you read this,
first night down will have come
and gone. You will have spent
hour upon hour hoping that some

really nice senior brings youabeer,.

though he or she probably didn’t.
You freshwomen will have had to
fight the upperclassmen off with a
fly swatter, but that’s ok.. They
probably won’t talk to you until
the next time they get drunk, or at
least until they need a Homecom-
ing date. I swear, I am not sexist.

Nailpolish and bloodshed don't mix.

I awoke this morning to the song
of a cardinal perched in the oak
tree just outside my window sill.
As I looked for her among the
branches, I was blinded by golden
rays of sunlight cascading into a
sapphire sky. I listened to the
peaceful song and enjoyed the
safety that encased me in my flan-
nel sheets. f

Five minutes later I descended
from the ivory tower. Reading the
paper, my eyes focused in on the
Statistic: Hatian dictators have
caused an alledged three thousand
political murders since1991. Re-

‘porters reminded me of rape and

other revolting violations. I stared
at an angry soldier of Cedras’ mili-
tary unit, pointing his gun at me
through the page while he awaits
the U.S. invasion.

That little bird was still sing-
ing when I remembered that one
million two hundred thousand
people have died in Rwanda since
April. One thousand'more people
will die there today from disease or
ethnic killing. You’ve seen the
pictures. There are no more devils

left in hell...

So, hell is breaking loose and
Isat at my desk with acup of coffee
in one hand, and the paper in the
other, and I read-about it.

Then, after I decided what

How can I conduct this kind of
daily life when 20 to 30 percent of
the adult population of a dozen
cities in Africa are infected with
the virus that causes AIDS? How
can I continue to live in this out-

rails, 1 AfterI decided what “ee

brutal, most violent regime any-
where in our hemisphere?” But
right then, nailpolish and blood-
shed didn’t really mix, and I got a
bad feeling in my stomach.

I tried to think about some-
thing else. Anyway, the soccer
team lost Wednesday five to one
and Africa is ravaged with disease.

I did it again.

vere social and economic decline?

Furthermore, I cannot forget
that the pain and suffering in my
own nation, indeed, in my own
community exceeds my rational-
ity.

Because I follow this pattern
every morning, I must constantly
be reminding myself of the Truth
that is greater than our situation,

yet is in the midst of our pain.
When I or anyone I love or the
masses I read about in the paper are
afflicted and grieved, or when 1am
the cause of another’s affliction,
God’s grace is not shaken from the
center of my life.

The knowledge of God’s grace
is the source of our hope and the’
reason for us to care, change and
forgive. When we fill our lives
with God, the hungry people within
our reach become our concern, and
we find our purpose in a life of
social work. Christ is hidden be-
hind the suffering appearance of
anyone hungry, homeless or dy-
ing, and He changes us when we
serve Him.

If we begin to look at the world
in this way, as a resource of oppor-
tunities to embrace God in others,
we will learn how to cope with the
numbers of deaths, the amount of
pain, and the poverty even within
our own lives. :

Giving our lives completely
to serve those in need, we will find
the rewards of living with hearts
full of love.

Matthew Hobbie ;
We have the right to have quiet.

Whoa arrival at Davidson Col-
lege, I, along with the rest of the
freshman.class, was told ofits many
aspects. One of these aspects was
the legendary basement of the li-
brary, the ‘dungeon’ or ‘tomb,’ the
place ‘where no one. speaks and
serious study occurs.

Curious, I went there myself
and, sure enough, the sign near the
door says, “This floor is desig-
nated a quiet floor by students’
request ...”

“Wow!” thought the naive
little freshman, that I was, ”’That’s
amazing!” It was amazing, all
right, and not true. While trying to
study, I heard outbursts of laughter
and much-louder-than-a-whisper
conversations not meant for that
floor, but for the one above.

I was taken aback. Was this
so-called ‘quiet floor’ alie? “What
else isn’t true?” I thought, "Was all
Ihad heard about Davidson’ s ideal
environment just a.story used to
lure us in where we would later
learn the reality? What about re-

sponsibility? What about honor?”
I was distraught!

One if the rights we have at
Davidson is the right to a quiet
place to study. People who violate
that quiet are infringing on another
student’s rights. Our freedom does
not allow us to take that rightaway.
It is disrespectful, rude, and could
be considered stealing.

It was my hope that the com-
munity of Davidson would be one
of trust, courtesy, and respect—a
place in whicha student could truly
learn and no one person or thing
would have the desire to stand in
the way of that.

I believe that atmosphere of
learning can happen and should
happen, but as long as students do
not take into account the rights of
others it will not.

So, fellow students, I implore
you. Please be respectful. Please
be courteous. And when in the
basement of the library, please be
quiet, for “In any language it means
courtesy.”

CHAOS by Brian Shuster

Pro sports: a national fetish |

t In midst of the moaning and be-

wailing over the (temporary!) loss
of baseball, I would like:to remind
everybody what professional sports
really are: an entertainment indus-
yin

Pro sports have devolved from
gentlemanly competition to the
trappings of big business, from the
national pastime to the national
fetish. The money circulated by
television rights, merchandizing,
and by players’ salaries and adver-

tising contracts is staggering. If’

people thought of sports a little
more rationally, then perhaps ob-
scene escalations of greed such as
the baseball strike wouldn’t hap-

pen.
Why do we as a nation devote

so much of our time to feeding the
pro sports machine? -Why is it
news? I cannot express how sick
am of seeing sports headlines tak-
ing up front pages of newspapers
and commandeering a good chunk
of the evening news. Witness the
public self-destruction of a washed-
up football star turned B-movie
actor overshadow real news:
Jimmy Carter practically saved the
world and nobody noticed.
Playing a sport well is defi-
nitely an honorable skill, one wor-
thy of recognition, but why does it
outshine the also significant
achievements of other skilled
people, professional or not? We

_ don’t see superior achievements in

sculpture, painting, music, etc, on

the evening news, but we are treated

to a healthy dose of sports cover-

age froma genial mustachioed male
sportscaster.

Why not grant pro sports their
own outlet, appropriately right next
to “Entertainment Tonight,” so
people like myself don’t need to sit
through the sports to get to the
weather. -

My father once told me the
primary reason pro sports have be-
come a social necessity is that it
gives us something to talk about.
Put a bunch of people together
from any origin, age, or physical
state and they will wind up talking
about “the game.” If we can’t find
anything else to talk about, then
we’re in truly sad shape.

My kids aren't
going to worry the
way I did.

Stability from page 8

everyone’s lied to you all your life
and money is important. So you
grow up, go to college, work on
Wall Street, invest, and you make
big bucks—you suddenly realize
it’s a lot easier then they told you
years before. My kids aren’t going
to worry the way I did, and when
I’m done providing for them, I’m
going to provide for every agency
that could have helped me out when
I was a kid. No, money is not |

necessary, but when you do good

things with it, it’s nice. Remember
that.”

I should have been the one to
write that letter. A long time ago.
