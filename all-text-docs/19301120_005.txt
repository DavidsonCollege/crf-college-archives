THE DAVIDSONIAN, NOVEMBER 20, 1930

’CATS RISE TO SUPERB

(Continued from page 1)

Every Davidson player who saw action
deserves citation, for the play of every one
was magnificent, both on offense and de-
fense. However, the following deserve espe-
cial praise: Fraley, Brohard, McCall, and
McQueen were the most potent in tearing
the Carolina line to shreds, gaining by rush-
ing 230 yards to their opponents’ 115, and
knocking down 12 of the 18 passes in the
vaunted Carolina air attack, and intercepting
two. Thad Brock and Steve Brown were the
especial powers in the valiant Red and Black
line that spelled Carolina’s doom. Time after
time, these two brilliant players broke
through to spill the Blue and White backs
for losses. Magner, Nash and Branch were

the big guns of the Carolina attack, while |

Blackwood and Fysal were outstanding in
the line.

To McQueen goes the lead-up credit for
the Wildcats’ touchdown. Early in the sec-
ond quarter, he took the ball and sliced
off tackle for 53 yards, putting it on the
Carolina 30-yard line. To Brohard and Fraley
goes the credit for being the most consistent
gainers, and to Joe McCall goes the credit
for making the longest Davidson run, 63
yards on the opening kick-off. To Johnny
Branch goes the credit for the longest run
of the day, a return of a punt for 69 yards.
But to the entire Davidson team should go
the credit for playing like a band of cats
completely wild.

For the last three periods of the game, |

Carolina was fighting with her back to the
wall, seldom having the ball past the 50-
yard line. And on three occasions, the Wild-
cats threatened seriously to score again.
Three times the ball was driven within the

|help, she establishes hypothetical circum-
| stances, and endeavors to lead up to some
possible conclusion as to the identity of the
murderer. A search of the room yields the
| evidence they have been looking for—a fresh
| blotting pad where the old one had been—
| Obviously some one had been in the room
| since the party of tennis players left, beside
the victim, since the paper had been carried
| away. Next they find by extensive examina-
tion of the two questioned men’s alibis that
there is a flaw in them, and that they must
| have been framed. The alibis were true, but,
| the time they gave was wrong, and they
|had time to be in the house at the time of
| the sad occurrence. They retire believing
they have the correct solution of the mys-
| tery of the death of Arthur Ludgrove.

The next morning Susan cleverly leads
Carter in the sitting room, locks the door,
slips the key under to Jane, “planted” out-
| Side, and tells Carter of the discovered evi-
dence found in his pocketbook. He threatens
her with a revolver, to force her to give it
up. After cleverly giving Jane a cue, Jane
comes in quietly and hides as a witness to
the ensuing conversation, in which Susan,
having given up the envelope presumably
containing the evidence, leads him to a full
confession. Thus foiled, and the “envelope”

being a dummy, the murderer tries to escape,
but finds himself confronted by the Sergeant,
and arrested. Jimmy, who has been out with
the Sergeant, nervously awaiting the out-
come of Susan's scheme, is finally free to
come in again, and he receives a warm wel-
coming, needless to say, for a happy ending

of the day’s occurences, but only a beginning
of those to follow.

The characterization as a whole was very
good, and some stellar dramatic ability was
displayed. The choice of the particular play
was very commendable, as well as the con-
sistent practice so apparent.—Reviewed by
D. D. McBryde.

Jack Murff, Centenary, returned a punt 96
yards for a touchdown, but his team lost
to the Texas Aggies, 7 to 6.

Robert McNamara, New York University,
starred in his team’s 20 to 7 victory over
Carnegie Tech, making a 42-yard touch-
down and kicking one pune 70 yards.

years previously, caused them to be sen- |

The second act reveals the workings of the
police, and the conclusion that they reached,
that the case was one of suicide, since the

occupants were all away playing tennis, or, |

as in the case of Laverick and Carter, had
collaborative alibis under different circum-
stances, eliminated murder as a possibility,
and since the position of the body, telephone,
etc., eliminated accident.
