The DAVIDSONIAN, April 23, 1919

Two Debates Secured
With Other Colleges

Davidson is putting out two debating
teams this year, both of which are rep-
resented by excellent debaters. “These
men are working hard and are going
to do their best to win the honor for
old Davidson, so let us back them up
and give them a word of cheer when we

meet them.

Both teams ivill debate the same
question, which is: “Resolved, ‘hat the
Federal government should = run and
operate’ the railroads in the United
States.” Davidson upholds the negative
in the two debates ,one with Mercer and
the other with Washington and Lec.

Flinn and R. 1. Hall with E. A.
Woods as alternate will compose the
team to debate Mercer. ‘This debate
will be held on May 2 or 3 in Atlanta,
probably in the ‘ech Y. M. C. A, audi-
torium. ‘These men have been working
hard for some time and now have al-
most finished writing their debate. No
doubt Mercer has a strong team and
will offer a great deal‘of opposition, but
we hope that our team will win the
decision.

W. M. Currie and E. G. Lilly with
Liston as alternate will be ready to face
Washington and Lee upon their arrival
here on May 5th. “Phese men have
completed their outlines and. are now
working hard filling it in with good facts
and reasoning. ‘This debate will be held
in Shearer Hall and the public is cor-
dially invited.

Let us make them feel that we are
backing them up just as we do our base-
ball team. ‘They are working just as
hard and probably there is not as much
pleasure in it as there is in playing ball
and other athletic sports. ‘Che whole stu-
dent body wishes for them the greatest
of success.

SOCIETY ‘TEAMS CHOSEN IN
JUNIOR-SENIOR PRELIM.

The Philanthropic Literary Society
held the preliminaries for the Junior-Se-
nior debate on Tuesday April 15. Only
one contestant, O. P. Hart, undertook
to uphold the affirmative, whereas there
were three champions for the negative,
D. M. Chalmers, ‘TF. H. Spence and C.
B. Alexander. ‘The question was: “Re-
solved, ‘That the United States should
adopt the Initiative, Referendum and
Recall.”

O. P. Hart urged that much needed
reforms in legislation on child labor, tax-
ation, etc., would be quickly brought
on by this measure, quoting as authority
Judge Ben B. Lindsay and others. D. M.
Chalmers stated that this proposal is not
practical, and that the United States is
too large for its to succeed. T. H. Spence
showed that it would entail greatly in-
creased costs, especially at elections and
that States where it has been tried are
no better off than others. C. B. Alexan-
der spoke from the standpoint of a stu-
dent of government, and based his ar-
guments on the theory of democratic
government.

The judges, Profs. Reed, Woods and
Garnault, decided that Chalmers, Spence
and Aleaxnder should compose the team
with Hart as alternate.

In the Eumenean Suciety, composed
of R. L. Liston, C. O2 McGirt and E.
A. Woods, there being no alternate, was
chosen without a preliminary contest.

“FRIENDLY ENEMIES" WAS
COMERY FEATURE OF MOVIES

The movies Saturday night evoked
more applause than ever before. The
first two reels disclosed a comedy of the
slap-stick variety, “Friendly Enemies.”
The next two showed Liberty Bond
parades in Los Angeles. ‘The fifth reel
was a dramatized story in which the
hero had to push his lady fair a mile
or more in a tin Lizzie whereof the gas
tank was empty. Notwithstanding the
lady applied the brakes every few feet
or so, the story ended happily, fading out
on a long and blissful kiss.

EASTER EGG HUNT GIVEN
FOR BARIUM SPRINGS

Under the supervision of Dr. Sentelle
the intermediate department of the Sun-
day school went up to Barium Springs
Monday afternoon, The trip was ac-
companied by a welcome surprise to the
children at Barium Springs in the form
of an Easter egg hunt, which was enjoy-
ed as much by the party from Davidson
as by the children at Barium Springs.

REPORTERS' CLUB FEED
A d@QWLING SUCCESS

The Davidsonian Reporters’ Club
feed in Chambers was a howling success,
for the freshmen were not beaten at all.
However, it was a swell (ing) affair so
far as 25 of the 1 1-4 score men pres-
ent were concerned. Spence was elected
toastmaster and his knowledge of the
duties of that. official seemed to be about
on par with a bushman’s acquaintance
with finger bowls.

The table groaned (we had to use it—
it's custom) beneath its load, for a very
brief space of time, while those present
were arguing as to the proper method
of giving the signal to begin.

When this dispute was finally settled
and the party fell to or rather grabbed
two handsfull, a rare exhibition of cram-
ming was given. Not even on the night
before Soph Math, exam. has its equal
been seen.

In spite of the vigilance of the pro-

been smuggled in and were drunk next.

joke. No one knew it at that time, how-
ever, so he was not censored for unbe-
coming gaiety on so sad an occasion—
for the feed.

Many other things happened at the

The crowd broke up, each one declar-
ing that he had enjoyed his own hos-
pitality very much.

“Do you think you could learn to love
me?” asked the young man.
“Well—I don’t know,” replied the
sweet young thing, thoughtfully.
“— have $5,000 in Liberty
stock—”

“Go on. I’m learning.”

“And $50,000 in well-paying real es-
tate.”

“Al right, dear. I surely do. Believe
me, you are some teacher.”—Yonkers
