New professors add diversity to campus

By LAURA BATTEN

AARON LEVINE
This is the final installment of new
professor profiles.

Catherine Slawy-Sutton

An international professor has
joined the French Department this
year.
Professor Catherine Slawy-
Sutton grew up in France and
Senegal, and studied at the Uni-
versity of Nice in France.

She considers growing up in
Senegal a rich experience. She
grew up and went to school with
native Africans. Slawy-Sutton
feels that blacks and whites work-
ing together helped subdue ra-
cism.

When her husband, Professor
Homer Sutton, who is also a
Davidson professor, was the di-
rector of our program at
Montpelier, Slawy-Sutton taught
at Montpelier as well. She taught
English to Africans and French to
f oreigners.

Her experiences in the
academic world of both France
and America have led her to keen

observations on the comparison ~

between European (French) and
American academic life.

In France the professors tend
to be aloof from the students; the
students are mostly on their own,
she explained. The academic life
is less regimented in most of
Europe than in the United States.

Despite Slawy-Sutton’s uni-
versity background, she is en-

College counseling

thralled by the small town college
atmosphere of Davidson and its
honor code, which she was not
familiar with in France. She be-
lieves the code promotes a climate
of trust and closeness between stu-
dents and professors.

She earned her Masters in En-
glish at the University of Nice,
and her PhD in French at the Uni-
versity of Indiana in
Bloomington.

Giles Cutler, Jr.

Joining the ROTC department
this year as assistant professor of
military science is Captain Giles
Cutler, Jr. This term he is teaching
Freshman ROTC and is serving as
enrollment and recruiting officer
for the department.

Cutler is from Bath, N.C.,
which is located in the eastern part
of the state. He graduated from
East Carolina University in 1973
with a B.A. in Sociology and Psy-
chology. After starting seminary,
Cutler had a change of heart about
becoming a minister. Instead he
went to work for a Tennessee
bank, of which he became assis-

tant manager, and later he spent
five years working for the govern-

: ment.

Cutler began his military care-
er in the North Carolina National
Guard in 1971, where he was en-
listed for two years. He then went
on to Officer Candidate School.
Of the approximately 435,000 na-
tional guardsmen, Cutler is one of
800 serving on active duty.

Cutler has an assortment of
hobbies. He enjoys hunting (he is
an avid turkey hunter) and usually
jogs five miles a day. He also
spends time training retrievers, in-
cluding two Labradors of his own.

James Sperling
James Sperling comes to
Davidson as a visiting lecturer of
political science this year.

A native Californian, Sperling
was born in San Francisco and
lived in Santa Barbara for many
years. He graduated from the Uni-
versity of California at Santa Bar-
bara with a B.A. in political sci-
ence in 1974.

Sperling has spent quite a bit
of time studying abroad. He wona
Fulbright-Hayes graduate fellow-
ship to attend the University of
Kiel in Germany and a graduate
fellowship to study at the Univer-
sity of Geneva in Switzerland.
While doing post-graduate work
at Edinburgh University, Sperling
met his wife of 11 years, Joy. She
is an art history professor at the
University of Iowa.

Sperling received his M.A. at

Johns Hopkins School of Ad-
vanced International Studies and
is in the process of completing his
PhD at the University of Califor-
nia.

Roy C. Caldwell

Roy C. Caldwell, Jr. has
joined the French department for
this fall and winter as a visiting
lecturer.

Presently Caldwell is com-
pleting his dissertation at UNC on
comparative literature which he
will submit this winter for his
Ph.D. Caldwell enjoys games so
he chose to write his dissertation
on the lubic (game-like) aspects of
narrative, discussing ‘stories that
tell themselves by game struc-
tures.” Caldwell’s paper surveys
works of Robbe-Grillet, Kafka
and Sterne.

Caldwell grew up in
Nashville, Tenn. and in areas of
Virginia. He took Latin in high
school but was interested in the
maths and sciences. He attended
college at Rensselar in upstate
New York, where he started out as
an engineer student but eventually

Friday, October 11, 1985 THE DAVIDSONIAN

became a major in european his-
tory. He also studied three years
of German there.

Impressed with Davidson,
Caldwell commented that this is
an “intimate community in which
students are both bright and
eager.” Reflecting on his experi-
ence at Chapel Hill, Caldwell re-
marked that one has “the privilege
of being anonymous” there. How-

ever at Davidson, he said, one has

the privilege of isolation from the
“turmoil of the outside world and
its complexities” thus students
have the opportunity to devote
utter concentration to studies.
Caldwell also felt that the physical
separation of departments at
UNC, “each in its own isolated
building,” created an atomos-
phere of rivalry between the dif-
ferent academic areas, and that
Davidson's Chambers provided a
pleasant and cordial scholastic
community.

Caldwell likes to run his class-
es at a rapid pace and emphasizes
active participation from students.

Psychologists provide varied services

The following is the first installment
of a monthly guest column written by
members of the College Counseling Staff.
Each article will present information rel-

evant to broad concerns about mental
health.

At any given time several folks at
Davidson cross the fine line from “‘stimu-
lated” to “stressed”, from “disappointed”
to “depressed”, or from “apprehensive”
to “anxious”. Most keep these concerns
to themselves to preserve their privacy —
others’ problems can exhaust the good-
will and resources of friends, hall coun-
selors, faculty advisors or the Dean of
Students’ Office. When members of the
Davidson community experience these
junctures of crisis, confusion or be-
havioral and emotional difficulty the
Davidson College Counseling Center can

_Offer them help.

Consistent with the practices of pro-

fessional psychologists, the identities of

David Staton

those using the Counseling Center re-
main confidential. Services are offered at
no charge to students. They include
counseling, psychological assessment,
psychotherapy and, when appropriate,
referral for community resources. The
Counseling Center is located in the suite

Elizabeth Shaw

of offices in the south basement of the
Union Building and anyone desiring an
appointment should contact Mrs.
Catherine Wilson at extension 130. Ap-
pointments are available in daytime and
evening hours. Services are provided by
professionals who have earned docto-
rates in psychology.

Dr. David Staton is beginning his
third year with the Counseling Center,
with office hours two days per week. His
graduate training includes a doctorate
from UNC-Chapel Hill and an internship
at the University of Oklahoma Health
Sciences Center. After working almost a
decade with the two county Gaston-Lin-
coln Area Mental Health Program as a

staff psychologist and as Director of Psy-
chological Services, he left that position
in January to establish a private practice
as a licensed clinical psychologist in
nearby Lincolnton.

Staton notes that as an alumnus of
Davidson, he finds it gratifying to ob-
serve the growth of the College and to
contribute to furthering that growth with-
in the community and the individuals
seeking services. He adds that students
here are especially engaging and effec-
tive clients who grapple with issues and
do a lot with their sessions.

New to the Davidson community,
Dr. Elizabeth Shaw is a licensed clinical
psychologist practicing in Charlotte. She
pursued her graduate training in San
Diego, California and practiced there for
five years before relocating to North
Carolina a year ago. Eating disorders are
an area of particular interest in her prac-
tice. In addition to her clinical work here
and in Charlotte, Shaw has adjunct facul-

Cole Barton

ty apppointments in the psychology de-
partments at UNCC and Queens College.

Dr. Cole Barton works in the Coun-
seling Center on Tuesday evenings. He is
an assistant professor in the psychology
department, and directs Davidson's sum-
mer internship program at Broughton
State Hospital. His clinical experience
includes work in private practice, com-
munity mental health, a correctional in-
stitution, and a pediatric hospital. He has
published research methods. One reason
Barton enjoys work in the Counseling
Center is because it allows him to make a
professional contribution to the College
besides teaching.

By virtue of their unique point on dif-
ficulties in the Davidson community, the
Counseling Center staff is in a good posi-
tion to recognize trends in campus life
that may become more widely shared
problems. The staff works with the facul-
ty’s Counseling and Guidance Commitee
in concert with the Dean of Students’ of-
fice and student representatives to iden-
tify needs and anticipate student con-
cerns. To further complement the one-to-
one sevices provided in the counseling
center, the staff is also available to make

group presentations to students and staff,
and is going to undertake projects with
the Psycology Club to heighten campus
awareness of concerns which should re-
ceive some preventive focus.

Anyone can request information
about a specific topic by writing the ques-
tion and mailing it to Mrs. Wilson, or if
anonymity is not an issue it may be sum-
mitted directly to the counseling office.
