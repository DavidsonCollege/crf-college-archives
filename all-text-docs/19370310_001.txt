executive committee of the college.

His election came last Thurs-

The choice had already been ap-
proved by the athletic council.

has made football history with the
high school teams that he has turn-
ed out. He is well known all over
the Carolinas an outstanding

ter his teams won three state cham-
pionships in Class B football and
two in Class A, scoring over 2,300

their entire satisfaction at having

promotion of McEver to Doc New-
ton’s old position after the latter’s
appointment to head coach at N.

CUNNINGHAM EXPLAINS
HOW TO GET RELIGION

Winston-Salem Minister Dis-
cusses Conversation With
Nicodemus

as

members of

“How can I get religion,” was the
text used by the Rev. Dr. John R.
Cunningham, pastor the First
Presbyterian Church, Winston-
Salem, N. C., who was guest min-
ister at the regular vesper services
Sunday evening.

Dr. Cunningham
Scripture lesson from the first to
17th verses of the third chapter of
John.

Dr. Cunningham stated that his
text was not any easy question to
answer because a number of peo-
ple would say that the whole ques-
tion of religion would leave them
cold. A man could possess all the
advantages of a fine religion and
still get to feel dreadfully homé-
sick for something that life affords
He stated that Jesus Christ is
to make that contribution to
who are loneful in life, and
that there was a place in religion
for emotion, Dr. Cunningham stat-
ed that emotion could be shown by
the people at a football game or
in a war, but most of them failed to
show it in religion. But, he de-
clared, the absence of emotional up-
heaval does not. mean a man has
forgotten God, and that religion
is not of only getting
oneself saved, but it has a much
higher motive. The true aim is to
glorify God and bring him to a life
to_praise him,

To get religion, Dr. Cunningham
stated that people must use good
judgment and be deeply concerned
about it and not to be only inter-
ested in one’s profession. Then he
said, one must trust God accu-
rately and to lend ‘ourselves to
Christian faith and have a life by
faith rather than by sight. He
stated that most people wanted
faith to be in them before they
actually did anything about it, and
that it did not work. His third and
