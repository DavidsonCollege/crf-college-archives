Christian Commitment Views Discussed

By TOM AINSWORTH
Contributing Editor ’

Last week Davidson
College held a joint faculty-
trustee meeting in Hodson Hall
to discuss the college's position
in relation to its Christian Com-
mitment.

As reported by Religion
Professor Robert D. Kavlor.
“the purpose of the meeting
was not to come out with anv
specific questions or recom-
mendations. but just to air the
matter out among faculty and
administration and the
trustees” and therefore sup-
posedly to improve faculty-
trustee relations on an overall
basis.

The question of Davidson's
commitment to the church has
necn debated many times in
recent years. and according to
President Samuel R. Spencer
Wooo there is a widespread
teeling among all campus
groups. as well as trustees. thal
a shared diseussion 01 Yoavid-
son's rcligzious comnimtment
would be very valuable al this
ume

“To stwmulate discussion of the
subject, the coliege invited two
professors who have considered
the relationship of religion and
education in their studies to
speak at the meeting.

Roland M. Frve. English
professor of the University of
Pennsvlvania. spoke first.
followed by Rene D. William-
son. chairman of the depart-
ment of government at Louisi-
ana State University and a
professor at Davidson from

mation spirit in Europe from—

the increase in learning of the
Renaissance, Frye cited the
first instance of Protestant in-
fluence on education as Martin
Luther's call for compulsory
education in 1531.

Frye continued his survey by
keving on the Scottish role as
leaders in religious education
and culminating in the Puritan
Dissenting schools which led in
the revitalization of courses.
notably the natural sciences.

In relating his view to David-
son's position. Frye urged the
college to make a “‘continuing
effort to produce communities
of Christian scholars devoting
themselves to the art of lear-
ning.”

Adding that sinee ‘‘secular in-
Stitulions don't establish the
final pattern for higher
education. Frye charged
Davidson to be “the custodian
of Uns ¢reai Christian tradition
of a community devoted to
education.”

Waliamson took ThoTe a per-
sonal approach im his talk.
recalling his teaching davs at
Davidson when “what counted
was moral character.

“It Davidson is to survive. it
cannot be just another small
liberal arts college.’ William-
son warned. ‘The one thing that
can assure its survival and its
distinction will be its religious
conviction.”

Williamson stated that the
country today is involved in
what he termed “vast per-
missiveness"” and that a
separation from church affinity
“will not answer ‘who am 1” or
‘why am I here?’

"Students these davs are
church shy continued
Williamson they re afraid ol
being roped in and losing their
independence.’

Turning ys) attention to

Davidson's policy of en-
couraging its students and
faculty to contribute tn the

Christian community, William--

son said that “‘Davidson’s good
record of turning out not only
good moral people. but con-
tributors to society as well. was
made by Christians.

“What would a non-Christian
know about churchmanship? —
nothing."’ Williamson stated.
“Davidson cannot expect to
carry on this tradition with non-
Christian professors.’

Williamson continued by
Saying that “if a college
education is to be looked on as
preparation for life,’
Davidson should not vield to
“misguided. libertarian
pressures” and thus should
continue its religious commit-
ment to the church.

Finally. Wiltiainson urged all
those in atlendance to ‘“‘em-
mulate the Apostle Paul" in
making their ceetsions.

In response to the talks.
Kaylor tndiealed thal he “reac-
ted more positively to Frve than
to Wilhamson.
