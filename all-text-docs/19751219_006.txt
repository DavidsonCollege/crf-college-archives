LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

To the Editor:

Because I have no reason to
believe that anything but a
healthy mutual respect exists
between us, and because I
believe you too understand
that the exchange of conflict-
ing ideas and opinions is not to
be taken as implicative of
personal enmity, but rather
that such exchange leads to
more precise thinking, and
even to truth, if one is able to
believe that there is such a
thing: because of these two
considerations I am venturing

Devils, writing, and baseball

To the Editor:

“An apology for the Devil:

It must be remembered that
we have only heard one side of
the case. God has written all
the books.”’

My initial reaction to Mr.
Oliver’s letter of Dec. 12 was
one of amazement. The com-
position, disregarding the con-
tent for a moment if possible,
stands as an unimpressive
reflection on a gentleman who
obviously has a poor control
of the English language and a
painfully apparant lack of
style. The repititious usage of
the word “typical,” a distract-
ing profusion of tiresome
cliches, i.e. ‘‘swept under the
rug,” “ego trip,” ‘‘that kind of
nonsense,” “heart breakers,”
“Aren’t as cool,” inappro-
propriate modifiers used to
denote quantity i.e. “pretty
disgusting,’’ and collective
terms which fail to identify the
subject in question i.e. ‘‘pitiful
bunch” (of what, Mr. Oliver,
shoes? Baseball bats?) are
characteristic of slovenly com-
munication skills which do not
elucidate the issue but merely
detract from it.

Perhaps a theraputic course
in the basic writing skills
under the direction of Dr.
Frank Bliss could prove useful
for Mr. Oliver and hopefully
remedy his problems with self
expression.

After deciphering the con-
tent of Mr. Oliver’s garbled

note, I was impressed by Mr.

Oliver’s superciliousness. A
19th century author has a
most apt response for this
situation: ‘“The advantage of
doing one’s praising for one-
self is that one can lay it on so
thick and exactly in the right
places.” (Samuel Butler)

As a member of the Class of
77, I have been provided with
ample opportunity to observe
Mr. Oliver’s preoccupation
with the alledged detriments
of coeducation. I regard this
hobby, to use a kind ‘term, as

peculiar. Mr. Oliver consi-

dered, applied to, was ac-
cepted at, and chose to attend
Davidson College with the
knowledge that it was coedu-
cational. (I doubt the Admis-
sions Committe used Machi-
avelian tactics to obscure this
fact.)

Davidson College professes
to be a liberated institution
and the women of D.C. have
taken the opportunities which
the college has provided in
every discipline and activity.
We have done as well or
excelled in comparison to our
male counterparts and we do
not feel the need to remind the
student body of this fact in
every other issue of The
Davidsonian.

Mr. Oliver, you seem to
belong to Mr. Noel Coward’s
school of thought, “he who
fights and runs away will line

to fight another day.’’ To you
Mr. Oliver--put up or shut up.

Short
and
sour

To the Editor:

It would seem from Mr.
Oliver’s latest diatribe con-
cerning coeducation at David-
son that Mr. Oliver is ind
the one on an “ego trip.’
Please Hilton, roll over and
play dead before we get sick.

An irrefutable proof(?)

To the Editor:

Hilton Oliver is a fraud.

He constantly criticizes the
women students at Davidson
and advocates that the college
return to its all-male status.”

But it is comforting to know
that we no longer need to pay
any attention to this constant

babbling, which has found |

notoriety in this letter coulmn
and on various walls through-
out the campus.

Mr. Oliver, in responding to
the letter from the debate
team (Nov. 28), declined to
accept the offer for a public
debate because he felt the
letter merited no response. His
rationale was that the letter
wag written by a coed who was
afrdid to sign her name. He is
in error.

Mark Gergen and I will not
deny the charge of being
morons, letting it stand on its
own merits. As for being
women afraid to sign our
names, that is absurd on two
counts. First it is an insult:

the female sex to group us in
that category, although we
might be appealing to Mr.
Oliver in some strange way.
Second, neither of us are
afraid to sign our names,
especially when we offer him a
forum from which to express
his original opinions.

The Davidson community
should be informed that Mr.
Oliver was fully aware of the
authorship of that letter, prior
to the writing of his response.
That fact, combined with his
refusal by default to’ debate
the issue of co-education at
Davidson. with me, serves as
clear, undisputable, and _ir-
refutable proof that Hilton
Oliver is indeed a fraud who
advocates absurd positions
merely to attract: attention.

May his wandering pen find
peace in the lonely halls of
Chambers.

to disagree with what you
wrote in your last letter to the
editor.

Far from believing the girls
in Davidson to be “a true
detriment to the campus,’ I
am quite grateful that they are
here; for (if I may risk the
sentimental) I think that
having girls on campus adds a
touch of home to the place.

Furthermore, whether I am
grateful for their presence or
not, there is still the fact that
they have as good reason to be
here as I.

Learning, you remember, is
not the sort of thing that is
restricted by nature to men
alone, as childbearing is res-
tricted to women.

Probably, Davidson girls
have come here for much the
same reason that you and I
have--because they consider
Davidson to provide a good
atmosphere for studying.

At this point, no doubt, you
will respond, ‘‘Yes, but if the
girls came here to study, then
why on earth do they spend all
their time chattering in the
library, or watching the World
Series on TV?”’ To this I would
reply first, ‘“‘What were you
doing wasting time over a
baseball game anyway?’ and
second, ‘‘Have you never noti-
ced that sometimes even boys
too chatter in the library,
often among themselfves, with
not a girl to be seen?”’

But all this is not really to
the point of what I intended to
say. Nor are your comments
about the unreasonableness of
the girls demands to the
college, nor is that ridiculous
notion of yours that most girls
here care only about seeing
boys and being seen by them.
As to that last, though,
certainly that fault is as
common among men as it is

300 words in length.

To the Editor:

If you must react as you
have, Hilton, you shouldn’t
use The Davidsonian to adver-.
tise your emotional weakness.
Your letters are entertaining
and amusing but enough is
enough. If you have to view
your enviornment through
this frosted glass, at least you
could confine your opinions to

the limits of your academic
fantasyland.

Thank God I’m not you

among women.

A handsome boy is just as
likely to flaunt his beauty as a
pretty girl is to flaunt hers.
Let’s you and me just be glad
that we weren’t born graced
with any rare external beauty
that we might be tempted to
employ toward our own low
intents. But all this is to the
side.

What I really mean to say is
what I have heard simple
people say before, as they
gave thought to (what was to
cold, intellectual
climes of colleges and univers-
ities: that if in all our learning
we never learn how to get
along with one another, then
all our learning adds up to
nothing. That’s the truth, you
know. _

So what if the attitudes of
the girls here are, as you say,
presumptuous (not that they
are, of course)?

The attitude expressed in
your last letter is vindictive,
and that is worse. And if in
saying that ‘‘Most of the coeds
here are on an ego trip
anyway,” you mean to imply
that somehow you have had
the excellent fortune to have
been exempt from that deepest
of all human faults, i.e. self-
ishness, then I suggest that
you look again at yourself.
You might at least be as
critica] of yourself as of others.

In closing, I hope that this
letter will be the occasion of no
ill-feeling between us. And
Hilton, I wouldn’t dream of
trying to persuade you to
modify your opinions merely
in order to please the popu-
lace; but at least you could
soften you bludgeon with a
little charity and some com
mon sense. And as long as you
do that, I will always be :

Don Jackson, '77
Davidson College

You are Davidson acade-
mics carried to its logical
absurdity, that is, you have
become completely divorced
from the realities of living.
The effects of library rat-ism
are terrifying. Your example is
comforting in one way, how-
ever, because when I feel
depressed I can still thank
God I’m not you.
