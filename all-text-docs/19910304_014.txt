Davidson Swimming Returns

By Tom Koonce

Inthe 1970’s andearly 1980’s,
Davidson had very successful
swimming teams that finished as
high as second in the Southern
Conference championships.
Davidson also had several All-
Southern Conference swimmers,
six in the 1979 season.

The team’s record in 1979 was
12-3 followed by more exceptional
seasons and a record of 11-2 in
1982. Unfortunately, in that same
year, the Davidson swim program
was dropped.

The problem was Johnston
Gym. It was considered unsafe for
diving and Davidson swimmers
were forced to go to UNCC for
practices and home meets.

Now, the swimming area in the
Baker Sports Complex has gener-
ated a renewed interest in a
Davidson swimming and diving
team.

Aquatics Director Ron Morrow
recently received approval to rein-
state men’s and women’s competi-
tion swimming and diving. Up until
now, a Davidson club team has
been competing against such teams

as Pfeiffer, Salem College, and
Florida A&M.

The club team defeated Florida
A&M, a Division I school, last
month. Morrow said that the team
“did an outstanding job and came
away with a win against a strong
team.” ;

The college will not fund the
new intercollegiate swimming
program, so it is up to the Athletic
Department to find funds. Morrow
hopes to get some funds through
fundraising, since there are over
500 former Davidson swimmers.
The funds are primarily needed to
install an automatic timing system
in the new natatorium.

Morrow said that the new facil-
ity and student interest were the
main reasons for the formation of
the program. The new team will
compete on the Division I level
and nextyear’s schedule is already
falling into place.

In response to the rumors that
Cannon pool is too short for meets,
Morrow said that it is “the perfect
size.”

He added that the bulkhead

Please, Please, Please
Return To The Big
Southern Conference

By Bruce Balestier

They call the Big South the
worst basketball conference in the
country, and while that may be a
bitexcessive, itis incontention for
the honor. It is Small Time, capi-
tals intended, and the conference
basketball tournament held this
weekend in the middle of nowhere
(a.k.a. Anderson, S.C.) proved that
emphatically.

The Civic Center of Anderson,
a nice building to be sure, is still
little more-than a glorified band-
box. There are only seats on three
sides, and the scoreboards are
temporary. Joining the Big South
was a vast improvement over inde-
pendent status, but it is most cer-
tainly a dead end. We would be

crazy not to rejoin the Southern

Conference.

Academically, schools like
Furman, the Citadel and VMI
match up better with Davidson than
Radford, Winthrop and Augusta,
the academic giants of the Big
South.

In terms of name recognition
and national exposure, the South-
em beats the Big South hands
down. For most sports, the South-
ern is a step up in competition, but
one which can be handled. In fact,
many sports at Davidson already
schedule a host of Southern Con-
ference opponents.

Theimportance of Davidson’s
historical ties to the Southern
Conference cannot be overlooked.
Davidson belonged to the SC from
1936-1988, developing a number
of heated rivalries and enjoying a
moderate amount of success; the
Davidson basketball team ad-
vanced to the NCAA Tournament
in 1966, 1968, 1969, 1970 and
1986 while amember of the South-
_ ern Confernce.

The $17 million Baker
Sports Complex seats 5,700 for

basketball, and has beeneven close _

to being filled only. once, against
Duke last year. This year, the ‘Cats
drew decent crowds for Wake
Forest, Appalachian State (a South-
ern Conference school) and South
Carolina, but averaged about 1,000
fans forits Big South games. In the
Big South, there are no discernible
rivalries, and no one in the Char-
lotte area cares if they see them
even if they do exist.

Our roots are in the Southern
Conference, and my hunch is that
our rivalries there will be quickly
rejuvenated if we return. It is also
my hunch that people will turn out
in much greater numbers to see
Southern Conference opponents,
since alumni of Western Carolina,
Appalachian State, Furman and the
Citadel populate the Charlotte area.
It might be nice to fill Belk Arena
with people and bring in some
money to pay for it more than two
or three times a season.

Itseems likean obviouschoice;
Davidson belongs in the Southern
Conference.

* Sorry to contradict Bob Hornsby,
but I asked around this weekend at
the conference tournament, and
Bob McKillop is known as a good
basketball coach and a perfectly
fine excuse foraman. He probably
should have started Tumer and
Darry, but his manhood didn’trest
on the matter. As far as his inter-
ests being self-serving, of course
they were.

He gets paid to win basketball

games, and must do whatever he —

can in order to do that.

Somehow, Itrusthis judgment

in that arena more than that of Mr.
Hornsby.

meter events or 25 yard events.
Morrow said that some believed
that Davidson wanted a 50 meter
pool. This was not true, according
to Morrow, because Davidson did
not need a pool of that size and it
would have taken another million
dollars to make it that long.

Morrow is now in the process of
sending out surveys and getting a
brochure together. He believes that
there is a lot of existing talent on
the Davidson campus right now,
and hopes that qualified swimmers
who are not on the club team will
be inspired to swim foran intercol-
legiate team.

Spring training for the swimming
and diving team begins this week.
Anybody can come out to swim for
pleasure or to try out for the team.
The training is from 3:00 until 4:30
each afternoon this week.

The club team travelled to the
Triangle for a weekend meet with
the Master’s Swimmers from

. Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill,

their last meet of the year. Next
year’s intercollegiate team will
complete a full season, swimming
from August to April.

All-Stars, Moon
Dogs, Warner Hall
Win Imac Titles

By Bruce Balestier

Chuck Brooks’ desperation
tip-in as time expired gave the
All-Stars a 70-68 overtime vic-
tory over KA Gold in the A
League championship game.
Brooks’ tip-in came after Craig
DeRan’s 18-foot jumper fell
short. As the final seconds ticked
away, Brooks rose to bat the ball
up and in from about ten feet
away.

Brooks’ heroics obscured a
valianteffort from KA Gold, who
fell behind by more than ten
points in each half but fought
back both times. The All-Stars
led 66-61 before Matt Woodlief

drilled a three-pointer to‘cut the

lead to two. After a missed All-
Star free throw, Barry Grow
stormed the length of the floor to
convert a layup as time expired,
and sent the game into overtime.

In the overtime, KA Gold

was left with just 4 players after

Arthur Morehead fouled out,and_
enacted what was called the “box

and none” defense. Two free

throws from the All-Stars’ Al-

lan Thompson and two from KA

Gold’s Carter Payne provided

the only scoring before the deci-

sive tip-in.

In the B League title game,
the Moon Dogs made their deci-
sive run midway through the
second half, led by the scoring
of Todd Newnam and Chris
Sward, and coasted to victory
over Delta Force. Three-point-
ers by Delta Force’s Dave
Wright kept the game relatively
close down the stretch.

Cash captured the Women’s
League crown with a hard-
fought victory over Club.

Bryson Moore’s free throws
in the final minute were the dif-
ference.
