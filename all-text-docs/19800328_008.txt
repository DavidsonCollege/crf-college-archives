i ~

season having ended on a dis-
sapointing note, several of the
more unimaginable minds a-
round campus have taken up
the annual “‘what if’ question.
Such a question seems of parti-
cular interest this year,
however.

. What if Rich DiBenedetto,

Rich DiBenedetto

Chris Dodds and last, but by no
means least, John Gerdy had
combined their respective acts
on Coach Eddie Biedenbach’s
squad this season or last?
Considering the fact that sll
three did suit up together for

the ’77-78 Wildcats, the afore- .

mentioned isn’t totally unrealis-
tic; that is, it’s not as if I’m
considering how the Cats might
have fared had James Worthy
or Dominique Wilkins cast their
lots with Davidson.

Because of their respective
styles of play, one must reflect
on the past performances of
DiBenedetto,Dodds, and Gerdy
individually before considering
the possibility. of their talents
combined.

Rich DiBenedetto

strong forward
A rejuvenated Richie D.
returned to school this year
after an extended leave of
absence spent in Bergenfield,
N.J.-.refining his already im-
pressive skills. DiBenedetto,

, Gerdy, and Dodds: an unbeatable, but imaginary trio

who averaged 11.1 points and
9.2 rebounds per-game two

Southern Conference all-Fresh-
man team, has definitely im-
proved his game. No longer do
his game totals depend entirely
upon ‘bullish inside work. Di-

. Benedetto has added a -softer.-

fifteen footer and quicker spin
moves inside to his repetoire
which nicely compliment’ Rich-
ie’s ‘‘Maurice Lucas’’ attack
around the hoop.

Although some woulddisagree
I also contend that Richie D.’s
play has improved on both ends
of the floor. By season’s end
DiBenedetto was displaying
uncharacteristic concentration

~ on the defensive end and despite -

several lapses early in the year,
Richie does possess the physical
ability to play tough defense.
To all the armchair quarter-
backs on campus, I will grant
that the man isn’t quite Jerry
Sloan, but Richie’s defense will
continue to progress, that is, if
Coaches Biedenbach and Marv
Kessler have anything to say
about the situation.
DiBenedetto’s mental ap-

proach to basketball has been
questioned in the past, but
there was little problem with
regard to desire this season.
Biedenbach commented, ‘‘No-
body was more receptive to the
ideas of our coaching staff than
Rich DiBenedetto, on and off
the court. No one tried any
harder to learn and do the
things we asked. He progressed
much further than we expected;
from a non-playing situation to

_ all-conference is remarkable.

Richie is comfortable at David-
son now and likes the situation
here.”’

In terms of overall play, it
appeared that Richie D. had
toned down his game this year.
Former Marquette mentor Al
McGuire remarked, ‘‘the kid
had a little too much French
pastry in ‘his play two years
ago—now he doesn’t cover the
cylinder on every foul shot just
to show his ‘shocks’ and only
tries to slam when a single
defender blocks his path—as a
frosh he tried to dunk over
everybody and their mother.”

By the /way, DiBenedetto
averaged 20.2 points and nearly
eight caroms this season and
was named All-Southern Con-
ference.

Chris Dodds point guard

For those of you who don’t
know Joe Barry Carroll from
Hodding Carter, Dodds played
here two years ago as a fresh-
man and tossed in eighteen
points per outing before moving
his show to the Tiger Den in
Clemson, S.C. He was named to
the S.C. all-Freshman team
along with DiBenedetto.
Dodd's departure came after
Jeff Jones and Dutch Morley,
now point guards at Virginia
and Maryland respectively, had
decided against Davidson be-
cause of Dodd’s presence. The
untimely move left Coach Bied-
enbach’s staff without a point
guard recruit in the class of ‘82.

Not noted for his defensive
expertise while at Davidson,
Dodds has since shored up that

fenartennal: and also upgraded
his shot selection which easily
included the three-point line

_ two years ago. Despite limited

playing time and several subpar
performances this year at, Clem-

Chris Dodds

son, Dodds’ offensive ability
cannot be questioned. He is
dangerous up to 30 feet and
should be allowed more freedom
next year as Bobby Conrad
graduates and Billy Williams
moves on to bigger and better
things.

Had Dodds remained at Dav-
idson and improved his defense
and floor leadership, his pre-

sence no doubt would have been ~

an asset. No knock here on
Ernie Reigel, who is easily the
superior defensive player and
court general, but Chris Dodds
can loosen any defense with his
outside play.

John Gerdy —swing man

I only saw the man perfoem
for one season but I feel
qualified to say to all of you
Otis Birdsong supporters and
freshmen that when ‘‘the Gerd”’
was ‘‘on’’ there wasn’t a finer
shooter on this or that side of
the Mississippi.

As a senior Gerdy averaged
26.7 points per game, shot 52%
from the floor, 81% from the
line and never faced a weak
defensive player. Frank John-
son, generally thought to be one
of the quicker guards in the
A.C.C., has yet to locate his
strap after being drubbed by
Gerdy for 35 in the Coliseum a
year ago. Or ask Frank Mc-
Guire about Gerdy. The former
South Carolina coach compared
him to Jerry West after John
single-handedly dismantled the
Gamecocks during his junior
year, drilling 12 of 13 from the

; floor in the second half.

Though a weak defensive
player early in his career, Gerdy

strengthened that portion of his’

game noticeably by his senior
year in anticipation of a pro
career. As the nation’s seventh

leading scorer, an All- Ameri-
can, and a solid passer, Gerdy
seemed a good bet to stick with
a N.B.A. club, particularly with
the introduction of the three-
point rule. The New Jersey Nets
viewed things differently and
Gerdy, Davidson's career lead-
ing scorer with 2,483 points,
was axed in favor of several
* guards with no-cut contracts.
The Colossi United :
So what if DiBenedetto, and
aggressive offensive player a-
round the hoop, Dodds, a
sharp-shooting point guard
since’ transferred to Clemson,
and Gerdy, a classic perimeter
shooter, had played together
this year, or more realistically,
last year? The obvious response
is that there wouldn’t be enough

’ basketballs to satisfy the offen-
sive egos of each player or that ~

Davidson might give up 95
points per game. This, however,
is the easy way out.

An attack could be molded
which depended upon the op-

ponents’ play. That is, if N.C.

State or Wake Forest threw a

» quick man-to-man at the Cats,

the logical choice would be
down low with Richie’s power
game, although John Gerdy
against anybody isn’t-a bad bet
either. Or, if V.M.I. or the
Citadel dished up an aggressive
zone, then the offense should be
geared to Dodds and Gerdy, not
necessarily in that order: Nei+
ther should one forget Todd
Haynes and Jamie Hall, who
aren’t the poorest of offensive
players by any means.

Defense would prove more
problematic. A matchup zone

- seems the most likely coice, atr

least until improvement became
apparent in the individual play
of DiBenedetto, Dodds, and
Gerdy. Those who followed the
John Gerdy show no doubt
witnessed progress in his defen-
sive skills and by his senior year
“the Gerd’’ was no longer a
liability. Conditioning, tech-
nique and a desire to play pro
ball accounted for his improve-
ment. Dodds was forced to
concentrate more heavily on
defense in order to gain even
minimal playing time at Clem-
son while constant attention
from Biedenbach and Kessler
should: be noted in assessing
DiBenedetto’s noticeable pro-
gress on the defensive end.
Although two years ago David-
son was susceptible to quick
offensive teams, a lineup which
included Gerdy, Dodds and

DiBenedetto wouldn’t be terri-
bly weak defensively.

Another positive factor with
regard to this conjecture is the
stability of Davidson’s.coaching
staff. Eddie Biedenbach and
company seem set to remain
here at least until the program
regains the respect of Tobacco
Road.

As long as we're discussing
that which can never be, why

John Gerdy

not carry it a step further.
Imagine this, 7'2’’ Tom Dore,
who transferred after his fresh-
man year to Missouri, in the
pivot; Gerdy and Dodds in the
backcourt; Richie D. at power
forward and Al Wood, who was
courted long and hard by Dave
Pritchet before deciding on
Chapel Hill, at small forward;
with Hall and Haynes waiting
in the wings. An interesting
thought.
