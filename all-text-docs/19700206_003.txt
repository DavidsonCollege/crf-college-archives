To Play For Pay

The trustees have come and gone.

What was left behind has its most important im-
plications for football and athletic programs in general

at Davidson College.

With the proposals of the Academy for Educa-
tional Development and the reports of the Spencer
Commissions along with the committee work of the
trustees themselves, it seems that more action could
have been taken, but all that remains of their visit is
the new football subsidization plan.

At first sight, and perhaps at second sight, the
new policy is one which Richard Nixon would have
been proud of. There were two definitely opposed
camps on the issue and the trustee resolution seems
to have effectively met the demands of both groups,

In. the long run, however, I think that the trustees
might see their decision in a new light.

First of all the new plan puts subsidized football

squarely in the hands. of the alumni.

This year and next

there is no-doubt that the alumni will come through
for Homer Smith and the football team.

There is still the flush of succes from last fall’s
team and the challenge from the trustees’ to pull the
funds in from the alumni for the 1971- 1972 season.

The challenge comes from the new system that
the trustees have implemented. The alumni have, in
effect, been told to put up the funds for the subsi
dized football program which they demanded when
the Athletic Commission report came out last fall.

What happens, however, when the Wildcats come
across those"lean years that all major football schools,
let alone a newcomer to winning football like David-

son, suffer through?

The football program has a guaranteed base of
only the equivalent of 52 average grant-in-aid stipends.
Quite conceivably the funds from the alumni after a

poor season could drop, leaving funds o
upperclass scholarships and none for freshman schol-

arships.

to cover

If the trustees want a subsidized program, they
should not leave that program to the hands of the
alumni who can, quite realistically, expect a winner
for, their money. The alumni are paying for results.

Of course there are those alumni who are inter-

ested primarily in the value that the players get from
participating in the sport. But will these men earmark
their money for the football program rather than an-
other of the many areas at Davidson from which the
stydent can also derive valuable experience?

The trustees have not really decided anything in

my estimation. If they want to have subidized football
on the Davidson campus, they should expect the school
to pay for it. They have saved the general fund the

controversial $100,000 but the price was not worth it.
