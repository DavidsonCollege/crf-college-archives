To The Editor;
I am glad to be able to tell you that

P.U.G. now has a U-F.D. The name of

the UFD is SYSGOPUS, and you may

attach to it-as a non-owner.

We intend for the PUG directory to ;
be similar to the systems catalog on the
old PDP-8F system, serving as areposi- .

tory for the programs ‘written by. stu-

dents and professors and data-sets con- -

taining useful information. The files in
the directory are set up so that any non-
owner can read them; but not modify
them. The owner password is needed to
change any of the data-séts, ‘to adda
new data-set, or to delete an-old one.

We are now in the process of accumulat-
ing programs and data-sets for inclusion

‘i yee Seepomey:

Ifyou have anything which you feel
would be appropriate, for inclusion in
the PUG directory, please let us know. I
can be reached at 1-664-4157 (Box 1348)
or you can contact Jim Northrup at the

. same number (Box 1066). We encour-
age you to ATTACH to the PUG direc-

tory every now and then to see what is

available. The member DIRECTORY

isa listing of all the files in the directory

We hope that is have Sorpethning to

To whom. it may concer: |

Due to various reasons the Brothers of

‘the Kappa Alpha Order, at our annual

meeting to consider our ‘spring social ca-

lendar, have determined not to have Old —
South Weekend this year. ‘Other alterna-

tives are under consideration. .

We, the “ATO representatives in”
Germany, are writing to express our

-sympathy With the heroic efforts of our

comrades in Davidson to reestablish our
once sacred but now dwindling tradi-

tions. We, in doing our part, have taken

control. of the university in Marburg.

The taking over of 20,000 students was
a monumental task, but for the honor of
Davidson we feel it was worth it. So Eu-
rope is taken; We fly to Japan next
week. Zeros of the world are indeed

uniting! Sayonara!

~ Mark Phillips

Editor, The Davidsonian:
~The Davidsonian ‘has. never been

. mistaken for the National ‘Review, at

least not since I have been a member of
the student body, but to be ‘honest I
would not be surprised to see Hendrik
Hertzberg’s signature beneath: the edi-
torial comment after reading the balance
of the paper. Was I ready The New Re-
public or the Davidsonian, or is the lat-
ter an offshoot of the former? I very

- much enjoyed Elizabeth Kiss’ perspec-

tive piece and saw the usefulness of a
number of the aricles, but do Davidson
‘students desire a fine arts dominated at-
tack on -the status quo for a campus
newspaper? Two lengthy articles on art
history and the visual arts, in addition to

~ several questionable photographs and/

or sketches, would seem to be a little ex-
treme for one.issue. Why not save a few
such-entries for future Davidsonians?
Also, John Hartman’s comments
that a naked child was “probably getting
more ‘parental (or whatever) attention
than the average modern suburban
moppet does anyway” is hardly accept-
‘ble. (1 assume that such attention was
qualitatively positive.) And Stewart,
were you really accosted bya couple of.
misdirected Buford Pussers and Jackie
Gleason? Was your experience in South
Carolina realy analogous to that of Poles

~ in the streets of Gdansk? C’mon, Ste-

wart, you are the editor of this publica-
tion, you can do. better. Lastly, the
layout and handwritten print of your pa-
per left something to be desired.

_. My name is not William F. Buck-
ley, Jr,, but I would like to read a quali-
ty, well-rounded, and balanced newspa-
per. Please print material of more perti-

_nence to all Davidson students and from

both sides of the ideological spectrum,
i.e. economic discussion, foreign poli-
cy analysis, theological debate, etc. No-
tice that I do not advocate a complete

’ shift to the Right, but rather a balanced

perspective; my objective in writing is
to build up, not to tear down!
