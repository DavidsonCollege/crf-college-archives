The new dating games: dismissals, elimidations, five wheels and cruises —

By BEN TERESA WITH WARREN CHRISTIAN

After gorging on Thanksgiving turkey
on Thursday night, I found myself staying up
to watch Dismissed on MTV. At the end of
the show, as is customary, the coveted girl
announced her selection. She “dismissed”
the blonde, poetry-reading, good boy, and
she instead chose the Hummer-driving, bad
boy: she
needed
someone
who was a
going to be “aggressive and rude.” What is
going on? I had physical reactions to this
outcome. I hung my head in disgust, turned
off the TV, and went to bed not wanting to
wake up.

That night I was emotionally eviscerated.
MTV’s Dismissed left me completely drained
and devoid of hope. Much like Elimidate,
The Fifth Wheel, Shipmates, and Blind Date,
Dismissed is basically a title bout for the most
obnoxious, outgoing, promiscuous, flamboy-
ant, arrogant, flirt-head. And IJ think I am
addicted. (Check www.upn46.com
and www.imtv.com for showtimes.)

For those who have not had the
privilege of watching Dismissed, the
show involves three singles, one of
which wields the power to “dismiss,”
basically dump and humiliate, the unlucky
third contestant. In the aforementioned epi-
sode, two gentlemen (I use this term loosely)
were vying for one extraordinarily attractive
young woman.

The boys were exact opposites. On display
were the blonde-haired, poetry-reciting good
boy and the dark, spiky-haired, bad boy who

_ Christmas gifts

Don’t know what to buy for the person in
your life who has everything? Do some-
thing different this year and give a gift to
someone who may have nothing. An Alter-
native Gift is a perfect way to give to others
and make you feel good as well.

Alternative Gifts are necessities and tools
given to an impoverished community in
various parts of the world so that the poor
can make better lives for themselves and
their children. Gifts include bikes for Afri-
can women to take goods to market, clean
water for a village in the Dominican Repub-
lic, food and a night’s shelter for a family
here in the United States; there are also
many more gifts to choose from.

It works like this: Someone who wants to
give an Alternative Gift to, say, a family
member will fill out a shopping list of things
that will be* given to a community, and
donate money towards that project. The
.|money will be given in the family member’s
name; they will receive a card that tells
about the project and the money given in
their name. For example, I decide to buy an
Alternative Gift for my sister. I choose the
AIDS education project in Rwanda; | will
donate. $25 (the cost to help a church edu-
cate people about AIDS) in my sister’s
name. She will get a card in the mail with
details about the AIDS program and who
|gave the $25 in her name.

Davidson College will be having its very
own Alternative Gift fair on Sunday, Dec. 2
in the Union at 2 p.m. Incase you miss it the
first time, there will be a table set up.on
Monday, Dec. 3 in the Union at 2 pm.

‘their career, the

read, well, maybe the vanity plate on his
Hummer: CASTUD. The blonde boy was
polite: he opened doors wooed the lovely girl
with poetry. Upon provocation, he also an-
nounced his virginity,
his desire to abstain from
sex until marriage. Mr.
CASTUD, on the other
hand, actually insulted
the girl, and whenasked,
managed to describe
himself in three words: adventurous, cocky,
and... a slut. That description was offered
about two minutes into the date.

Of course, I must admit it is probably
unreliable to base someone’ s personality ona
thirty-minute show, but nothing could have
prepared me for the dismissal. I guess I
identified with the show and the loser too
much. I do not see myself ever driving a
hummer and certainly never indulging in
vanity plates. However, maybe that is what
MTV wants — for me to return for the next
episode hoping the nice guy gets the girl.
Apparently, I have no romantic future on
MTV. What a surprise.

mainly because
the witty Aisha Tyler hosts. Jabbing at her
own show, she concludes every episode with
following words of wisdom: “The Fifth Wheel,
where strangers become friends, friends be-
come lovers and lovers become bitter, sui-
cidal exes.” Something everyone whodoesn’t
have a 12:30 class should watch.

Elimidate is similar to Dismissed in that it

ELIMDATE

follows the same elimination of potential
dates. However, the dating pool is much
larger: there are four suitors instead of two.
Of those men who are “elimidated,” one
inevitably will raise
his shirt to the cam-
era, revealing per-
fectly sculpted abs
and proclaiming,
“This is what you’re
missing out

on,

baby.”. Yikes.

I remember one particular
episode of Elimidate in which
available for “elimidation”
were the usual meatheads and
pretty boys, but this time there
was something different. A
skinny bricklayer joined the
fray. Immediately, I was root- |
ing for him. After he made it
passed the first round, I cheered
on the underdog and began to think there was
hope for world’s imperfect bodies. I realized
I was only fooling myself when, after the
second round, the bricklayer was mercilessly
elimidated by the girl, an attractive magician’ s
assistant.

Perhaps not surprisingly, there are not many
episodes in which women are vying for one
man. I think I have
only encountered
one episode of
Elimidate in which
this scenario took
place. This episode
quickly deteriorated into a who-could-put-
out-more-the-fastest contest. The pursued
hombre of that episode also managed to begin
the date with a car wash, drenching all the t-

shirt and tank-top-clad women not five min-
utes into the show.

Maybe the funniest dating-show moment
for me occurred on Blind Date. As the name
suggests, two people are matched for a date,
and the cameras come along to capture it all.
On this hilarious episode a large longhaired
man half way through the date declared that
they should stop the charade and go home.
He walked out of the bar and left his blind
date behind. ;

There’s also Shipmates, hosted by dating
game show vet-
eran Mr. Chris
Hardwick of
Singled Out. On
this extended ver-
sion of Blind Date,
two singles set sail

love, hate, or all three. Arguably the most
inconsistent of the dating shows, Shipmates
suffers from a raging case of gonorrhea. No,
it doesn’t; STDs don’t plague Shipmates.
With its one couple format, Shipmates can be
as boring as the dates themselves. But when
the chemistry’s just right — or horribly wrong
— Shipmates makes for a bon voyage.

I have no conclusion to
elucidate my observations.
I don’t know why I watch
these shows; in fact, I am
little ashamed. My parents
are probably reading this
issue and wondering if the byline is a mis-
print.

But I will say this: if you are over twenty-
one and adventurous...

Radiohead’s I Might be Wrong: ultimately unsatisfying

By JORDON STEELE
Staff Writer

In an industry dominated by prefab pop and
hackneyed rock-rock, Radiohead spends its
time giving mainstream music listeners a
reason to continue
living.

The. British in-
novators released
the two most am-
bitious albums of

sullenly pithy Kid
A and its older,
wiser brother Am-
nesiac, ina span of
eight months.
Critics responded
by scratching their
heads and slapping
the band with the
reductive label of
“inexplicable ge-
nius.”

New Yorker
music critic Alex
Ross, one journal-
ist who resisted the
temptation totype-
cast Radiohead,
describes the Oxford-based quintet’s music
as “a tricky, eclectic song waiting to happen.”
This possibility of reward, dangling before us
like the grapes of Tantalus, is what teases the
listener. We await a cataclysm to no avail, a
dejection which, perversely, fuels our listen-
ing. As Yorke says on Amnesiac’s opening
track, “After years of waiting/ nothing came.”

Which is why Radiohead’s new release, /

Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings, is surpris-
ingly unsatisfying. The uncharacteristically
brief set—at forty minutes, it stands as the
band’s shortest album—does contain all the
elements of Radiohead’s greatness. “The
National Album” cleans out the clutter of its

free-jazz version from Kid A to showcase
Greenwood’s buzzing bass line and Yorke’s
beat-boxing.

In many ways, Yorke hasn’t performed so
evocatively since the days of O.K. Computer.
His vocals oscillate between squawk and
falsetto on the minimalist “Idioteque” and
nose-dive from wail to growl in a chugging
performance of the title track. On the plain-

tive “Like Spinning Plates,” Yorke takes to
the piano, in homage to the arena-rock ballad.

However, with / Might Be Wrong, we don’t
have to scavenge for beauty, as was neces-
sary on Kid A and Amnesiac. This realization
cheapens the reward.

Much of Radiohead’s live sound can be
traced back to its
early material, when
the band wasn’t
afraid of being “pi-
geonholed” as the
best British rock
group since the
Beatles. The previ-
ously unreleased
“True Love Waits,”
with its strumming
guitar rooting
Yorke’s sublime
tenor, holds J Might
Be Wrong in the
Radiohead of the
past. Sadly absent
from this compila-
tion is Jonny
Greenwood’s intri-
cate technofugue,
whose obfuscation
always keeps the lis-
tener probing a
sound with an empty center.

I Might Be Wrong gives the fans what they.
want and deserve: Thom Yorke unbound.
However, this holiday gift comes at the price
of removing much of the wonder from a band
who, for the last two years, has kept us
befuddled, frustrated, and perpetually de-
lighted.
