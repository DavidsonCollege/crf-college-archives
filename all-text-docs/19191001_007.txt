Dr. Grey Enters Upon Twenty-
Seventh Year of Service
to Davidson College

Long Period of Teaching Has Been
Marked by Great Success

William Richard Grey was born in!

Union county, North Carolina, in 1858.
In 1880, he entered Davidson, graduat-
ing in 1884, having received the Latin
medal in 1883 and the Greek medal in
1884. In 1885-86 he conducted the vil-
lage academy in Davidson and from
1887 to 1889 was principal of various
high schools in Georgia. In 1889, Dr.
Grey entered Johns Hopkins University,
winning an honorary scholarship » in
1890. He received the Ph.D. degree
from Johns Hopkins in 1893, and im-
mediately after was elected professor of
Latin and French at Davidson College.

At the end of the present year, Dr.
Grey will have served as professor at
Davidson for twenty-seven years. Dur-
ing this time he has become so inter-
woven with the life of the college that
it is quite difficult to imaginé the col-
lege without him. His scholarly learn-
ing, his facility in imparting knowledge
in the classroom, and his good humor at
all times have endeared him to the stu-
dents, and have won for him the ad-
miration of all who have been in his
classes. Davidson students are not espe-
cially inclined toward the study of the
classical languages, yet Dr. Grey has, to
a marked extent, prevented his Latin
classes from being the dry and inane
hours if torture generally so peculiar to
the study of Latin.

As we look to the future, it is with
the confident hope that for many years
to come, Davidson College will still
have the services of one of its most de-
voted alumni, Dr. W. R. Grey.

Major A. L. James, Ex-’06, Renders
Distinguished Service to County

Another Davidson alumnus has_re-
turned to this country with the mark of
a gallant and distinguished soldier. His
services were not only noted and re-
warded by the United States Govern-

ment, but have been recognized by for-|

eign commanders and kings. Major A.
L. James, ex-'o6, is the highly praised
soldier of whom the Dubuque (Iowa)
Daily News said recently:

“Dubuque is being honored this sum-
mer by the visit of a gallant and distin-
guished soldier, one whose services in
the great war were noticed by com-
manders and kings, one who was high in
the councils of the American army. Ma-
jor Alexander Long James, who is
spending a leave of absence at ‘Four
Mounds,’ the home of his father-in-
law, Mr. George A. Burden, was chief
of the Fourth division of the intelligence
section of the general staff in France.
‘The Stars and Stripes,’ the official news-
paper of the A. E. F., was published by
his division. This paper reached a cir-
culation of more than 500,000 copies.
Major James was chief military censor
of the A. E. F. and all the press, postal,
telegraph and cable censorship was con-
ducted under his direction. The propa-
ganda conducted against the enemy was
likewise one of the functions of his di-
vision. He also controlled sub-divisions
which were charged with the entertain-
ment and management of all visitors to
the A. E. F., with securing and produc-
ing photographic and pictorial records of
the war and with the necessary co-oper-
ation with the committee on public in-
formation and its work in Europe.

“Major James had been conspicuous-
ly honored, having received the order of
officers of the crown from the king of
the Belgians, the order of chevalied de
la legion d'honneur from the French
government and a citation from the
American commander-in-chief, Gen. Jno.
J. Pershing, for “especially conspicuous
and meritorious services rendered.”

’ “Major James marred Miss Viola
Burden, of this city, some years ago.
They have one daughter.”

M. A. Thompson at Hagyard

University

The Davidsonian is in receipt of a
letter from M. A. Thompson, ex-’20,
who is now at Harvard University tak-
ing a course in English under the Gov-
ernment plan. Thompson left college in
November of 1917 and enlisted in the
Marines. After two months’ training
at Paris Island, he went overseas, being
among the first Americans to go across,
He saw action at Chateau-Thierry and
Belleau Woods, where he was seriously
wounded on June 27. “Thompson then
returned to America and assisted in the
Third Liberty Loan drive.

Thompson has not completely recov-
ered, as will be seen by his letter, but it
is hoped that when he visits Davidson,
which we trust will be very soon, he
will be entirely well.

His letter follows: -

28 Conant Hall,
Harvard College, Cambridge,
24 Sept. 1919.

could not have if she were larger; and |

By coming to Harvard, I have been
near a very noted nerve specialist who has
not only operated upon my arm but has
Been prescribing treatment and looking
after my arm all the while. Then, too,
Harvard is a great college and has many
unique and: quite wonderful opportuni-
ties. My time here will mean a great
deal to me, and whatever I get will
mean just that much extra. Bue what I
wanted Davidson to know most especial-
ly is this: It matters not how good other
colleges are, there are none that will ex-
actly take the place of Davidson; and I
would have gone back there had it not’
been for treatment up here. :

There is a probabiltty of my having
still another operation—possibly next |
summer, but I hope to go down to
North Carolina again beforehatd. If 1
do, I shall go by Davidson.

‘Yours sincerely,

MOWBALL THOMPSON.
