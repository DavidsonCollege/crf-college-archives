The. Wildcat grid schedule for 1924 will include games with Carolina
and Clemson, at Davidson. Trinity and Wake Forest will probably be met in
Charlotte. The N. C. State game will go to Raleigh, and the Wildcats will
meet the Purple Hurricane of Furman University at the South Carolina State

Fair in Columbia. Elon, P. C., Hampden-Sidney, V. P. I., and other Virginia
teams have requested games for the coming season. Davidson will probably
stick to her policy of playing the same teams, whenever possible.
