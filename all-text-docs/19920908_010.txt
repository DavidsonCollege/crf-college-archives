ball into a thrilling, action-packed
game.

The main object of the game is
to touch the ball, which is slightly
fatter than a football to simplify
kicking and punting, to the ground
in the end zone. Merely crossing
the line does not constitute a score.
Touching the ball to the ground is
called a “try” and counts four
points. Upon scoring a try, a team
is allowed to attempt a conversion,
which is similar to the extra point
in football. In rugby, however, the
“extra point” is worth two points.
One can also score three points by
either kicking the ball from the
ground through the goal posts,
much like a field goal in football,
or by drop-kicking it through the
posts during play.

Advancing the ball to the oppo-
nents’ try zone can prove to be
difficult. First, cach team fields
fiftecn players. Therefore, there is
not much empty space on the ficld.
In addition, itis illegal to throw the
ball forward. Thus, one must al-
ways pass the ball backwards to a
player, much like a lateral in foot-
ball. In this regard rugby repre-
sents “razzle-dazzle” football. A
player may kick the ball forward,
but since kicks are often inaccu-

rate, the team usually loses posses-
sion. However, a kick can help
because the opponents receive the
ball at a point far downfield, and
field position is often more impor-
tant than possession.

Since blocking or obstructing
isagainstthe laws of rugby, a player
is vulnerable to attack by the op-
posing team. Making it even more
difficult to advance the ball is the
fact that when a player is tackled,
he or she must immediatcly re-
lease the ball. Idcally a teammate
will pick it up and continue ad-
vancing. However, the opponcnts
often gain possession after atackle. _

Each team of fifteen people is
divided into two groups, the for-
wards and the backs. The forwards,
which comprise the “pack” or
“scrum,” are heavy, strong and
ugly, and it is their job to win
possession of the ball. They also
must achieve dominance on the
ficld by pushing the opposing pack
backwards. Once the pack Wins
the ball in a scrummage, ruck or
maul, they relay the ball to the
backs. The backs are light, fast,
and agile, but they too are ugly.
Their duty is to carry the ball and
score. They sec most of the run-
ning, scoring, and tackling action
in the game and therefore must be
in excellent physical condition, as

well as be fearless on the field.

Together, the forwards and the
backs work as a team in order to
winthe game by pushing the oppo-
nents backwards and carrying the
ball forward.

Some of the terms of rugby. may
sound confusing, but they are not.
The maul and ruck are common
occurrences. Mauls andrucks form
when a player who has the ball is
stopped or tackled. If he or she is
only “stood up” (i.e. stopped form
moving forward without being
brought to the ground), then it is
not necessary to release the ball.
Consequently, a large crowd, usu-
ally made up of the forwards,
meshes together around the ball
carrier. This mass of pushing play-
ers is called a “maul.” Each team
attempts to push the other team
backward in order to gain field
position.

A “ruck” is very similar in ap-
pearance, the main difference be-
ing that the ball is placed on the
groundandcannot be touched with
the hands until itis maneuvered by
foot out of the crowd. “Lincouts”
arcanothercommon play. A lincout
occurs when the ball has travelled
out of bounds. Each team’s for-
wards line up perpendicular to the
sidcline and attempt to catch the
ball when it is thrown into play.
The lineout resembles a cross be-
tween the jump ball of basketball,
except each team has several play-
ers jumping simultaneously, and
the throw-in of soccer.

The most famous formation is
the “scrummage.” When a penalty
occurs, a “scrum down” is often
awarded to the non-offending team.
Each pack binds together in a very
J specific manner. Once bound, the
y two packs join together and begin
pushing. Then the ball is rolled
into the middle, and the fighting
for possession begins. As inaruck,
no one is allowed to use his or her
hands to touch the ball until it is
clear of the scrum.

The game consists of two 40-
minute halves, and is divided by a
five minute halftime. Play stops
only if the ball goes out of bounds
or if someone is injured. When
hurt, a player has one minute to
recover. If he or she cannot return

(| to play within the minute, a substi-

tution must be made. Only two
substitutes are allowed per game.
‘f there are any more than two
.njuries, the team has to play with-
duta full side. Consequently, each
player must be very tough and

“hands and ran with it.”

physically fit.

One final component, unique to
the game of rugby, is the post-
game party. At this time the two
teams kick back and relax together.
Here players compare wounds and
share war stories form previous
games. Many tight friendships are
formed through rugby, and no
doubt this odd custom of partying
with your “enemies from the field”
is largely responsible,

Rugby is a popular game
throughout the world. Legend has
it that the game began in 1823.at
the Rugby School in England when
a student named ‘William Webb
Ellis ... witha fine disregard for the
rules of football [soccer] as played
in his time, first took the ball in his
Rugby’s
popularity grew throughout the
Commonwealth and eventually
madc it to the United States. There
wasa decline in interestafter World
WarlII which some people attribute
to the growing feelings of nation-

_alism. Since rugby was seen as

“forcign,” many did not wish to
participate. However, the game has
been steadily gaining a following
since the late 1950s.

In the carly 1970s, Davidson
College formed the fourth rugby
club in the state of North Carolina.
The team was mostly from one
fraternity and was a dominant
power in the state. However, by
the late 1970s, the team folded. In

~ 1989, a new team was formed.

With only one full year of experi-
ence, the team won a medal in the
liberal arts school division at the
state tournament. Now in its sixth
straight season, the team looks to
repeat the greatness of its past.
Hopefully, this introduction has
made the game more understand-
able and desirable to watch, or
even play. Rugby is basically a
simple game. It requires great
stamina and toughness, but: it is
very exciting. Anyone can partici-

~ pate. One does not have to be big or
. Strong like the stereotypical rugby

player (although it does help to be
ugly). With the broad range of skills
involved in the game, anyone can
find a position suitable to his or her
talents. If anybody has any inter-

much success moving the ball in
the second half, the Quakers were
unable to provide a serious scoring
threat. All four quarterbacks tried
to bring the defending Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference champi-
ons back, but none was ultimately
successful. The last two, Jim Bob
Bryant and Reuben Burton, were
intercepted by Jason Branch and
Tom Bannister, respectively.
Branch’s interception led to
the game’s final tally. On the ensu-
ing play, Howell held the ball on
an option to the right and outran all
Quaker defenders as he scampered
63 yards to put Davidson ahead
18-3 with 2:50 remaining. The
‘Cats had another opportunity to
score with time running out fol-
lowing Bannister’s defensive gem.
Behind Kevin Holzworth, who re-
placed Howell at quarterback,
Davidson chose a conservative
game plan. Keeping the ball on the
ground, the ‘Cats ran out the clock
and secured Davidson’s first sea-
son-opening victory since a 15-0
triumph over Millsaps in 1989.
“We have a lot of young guys

_.this year, and this was our first big

test,” linebacker Martin McCann
said. “I think we definitely passed
it.”

Lineman Mills Ariail led the:
defensive charge for the ‘Cats,
racking up 11 tackles. Strong safety
Leonel Benoist.added 10 and a
sack, and McCann notched eight
tackles.

Offensively, Howell com-
pleted 11 of 21 passes for 114
yards and the touchdown to Bod-
kin; on the ground, he picked up
119 yards and a score on only nine
carries. Wright gained 33 yards on
the ground, and wide receiver Dan
Lamar paced the ‘Cats with 45
receiving yards.

Saturday’s match certainly
provided Davidson with a great
deal of confidence heading into
this Saturday’s contest at the Uni-
versity of the South. A large de-
gree of uncertainty surrounded the

Tew offensive and defensive sets

unveiled against the Quakers; the
18-3 victory proved that the ‘Cats
are staring directly at a successful
season. The next step will be taken
in Sewanee, Tennessce.
