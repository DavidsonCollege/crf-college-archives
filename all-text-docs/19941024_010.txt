Music Review
Dillon Fence

goes acoustic
with Living
Room Scene

By Tom Bavis

Dillon Fence’s new album
starts ambitiously enough with the
anthemic title track, “Living Room
Scene.” Greg Humphrey’s voice
tries to keep up with the heights its
owner has chosen for it as the bass,
drums and two guitars stomp out a
simple 4:4 time. It is a convincing
example of the kind of song Dillon
Fence has been making for years.

One could consider ‘Living.
Room Scene” wise or foolish, de-
pending on one’s perspective: as a
listener, I was impressed enough
to listen on, but left a bit disap-
pointed when the next 45 minutes
failed to deliver upon the promise
of the first song.

That is not to say Dillon Fence
did not come close. “Queen of the
In-Between” features some of the
best backing vocals of the Chapel
Hill band’s career, as well as a
fiery guitar solo that actually goes
somewhere. “High School Sap,” a
lethargic tribute (or rip-off) of psy-
chedelic era Beatles, is the most
cleverly recorded song of their ca-
reer. Its backwards guitar solos,
random sound bites, and gurgling

vocal tracks rest comfortably atop.

a molasses groove. “High School
Sap” reasserts how unimportant
lyrics are to the Dillon Fence expe-
rience—twenty listens into the
record, I have yet to memorize a
word.

After a brilliantly off-rhythm
introduction, “Day After Tomor-
row’ chases “Living Room Scene”
as the catchiest rocker on the al-
bum. It comes close. More than
any other songs on the album, Greg
Humphreys’ voice on “Day After
Tomorrow” and the trotting “‘Cof-
fee Cup” sounds eerily like a young
Rod Stewart. Gentle when his

_voice is low, Humphreys inevita-

“bly waxes gritty as he struggles for
notes his voice was never meant to
hit.

More than most bands, Dillon
Fence strives to wiggle its way
around in-bred weaknesses and
exploit strengths to create the high-
est quality music. Yet there are
some failed experiments on their
third album. Unwisely placed af-
ter the adrenalin-pumping ending
to “Day After Tomorrow,” bassist
Chris Goode’s cutesy and aimless
“‘Where’s Tour Kiss” falls flat on
its face. ‘The melancholy piano
ditty “Fayetteville” ostensibly
taped on a home tape recorder,

_comes off as quite contrived after a

“ ‘dozen rock songs—it’s as if its co-
writer Humphreys was saying,
“See, I really have lots of varied
talents!”

So although “Living Room
Scene” is probably the best Dillon
_ Fence album yet, it still shows that
its creators can improve. Since all
the band members are in their twen-
ties, they still have plenty of time.

This year many designers have
declared a regenesis in their fash-
ions. “The inspiration,” one de-
signer stated, “is coming less from
the street and more from the ball-
room. This season’s designs have
taken their inspiration from so-
phisticated society women instead
of twentysomething girls.” This
designer’s statement can be seen
in arecreation of the Jackie O look
in fashion. The return of twinsets
with only the top button clasped;
small, white gloves; fitted, sleeve-
less dresses with fitted, cropped
jackets; and the ever-popular
equestrian styles are examples of
the resurfacing of Camelot. Most
significantly the hottest cut of skirts
this season are the A-line, the shape
Jackie O made famous. I suspect
we will see some pillbox hats soon.
As muchas designers wanttoclaim
a rebirth of the body conscious
female style—approaching its clas-
sical pinnacle in the Kennedy era—
as a reaction to the past years of
looser grunge styles, the hip is still
undeniable related to what is worn
in youth dominated clubs, restau-
rants, and bars.

Though grunge has been de-
clared officially dead, the style it-
self has not been abandoned. Even
on the runways grunge still rules,
albeit self-consciously. The wor-
ship of the young hip on the street
can be seen in the body art and
hairstyles of the models. The short
crop is the epitome of model cur-
rentness on the runway, and the
male models are unlikely to be
able to strut without one essential
ingredient: facial hair.

Facial hair has. become the
attitude behind men’s hip fashion
in the past three years. To have it
is hot. The style once had to be
sparse and particular, and the ulti-
mate coll was a well-managed

goatee; but times they are a-chang-
ing, and the new rage is anything
goes as long as it is facial.
Davidson, often called the epicen-
ter ‘of unchic L.L. Beanness, has
not been unaffected by this rage
for facial hair. One need only look
at Nat May’s freshmen face book
picture and compare it to the noble
Union leader one sees today (P.S.
Nat this is not flip; we love you!!)
to comprehend that facial hair has
arrived at Davidson. A trip to

PiKA might also be in order to
understand that facial hair is part
of Davidson’s avant-garde fashion
culture, and despite beard burn,
Davidson women don’t seem to be
complaining. Josh Gaffga, a con-
noisseur of fashion’s palate of fa-

cial hair, says his reason for grow-_

ing his goatee was to “hide my
sexual repression.” This may not
be necessary, as most women I
asked were genuinely more at-
tracted to men with controlled fa-

cial hair, though some women, like
Elizabeth Fleming, were “wholly
uninspired by either way on the
facial hair issue.”

Still, the importance of this
issue (I’ve got to somehow justify
my potential as being the writer of
the fluffiest column at Davidson)
rages on as women cannot deter-
mine if men with beards are better
kissers without facial hair. All I

Exhibited artists talk with VAC crowd

Kneeling, standing, and

students and faculty filled the gal-
lery, it soon became apparent that
Glen Dasher and Dan Sutherland
were going to entertain a large
crowd. :

ter provided a walk-through, dur-
ing which the artists discussed their
works.

Glenn Dasher, asculptor from
Huntsville, Alabama, worked as a
sculptural consultant for the Vi-
sual Arts Center. Dasher first ex-
plained how some of his ideas origi-
nated for his work. He said that art,
like science, is a “voyage of dis-
covery,” and the artist never com-
pletely knows how a piece will
look upon completion. Dasher
admits that as a younger artist, he
“thought it was nuts” when an art-
ist might say that he would wait for
a “piece to speak to me.”” Eventu-
ally he, too, began leaving carved
fragments around his studio, until
the work might make itself evident
to him.

- Combining both figurative
and non-figurative aspects in his
works, Dasher often carves frag-
ments of the human figure and
uses these in conjunction with alu-

minum or steel abstraction. He
believes the observer not so famil-
iar with abstract sculpture may find
an entryway into the work through
the figurative aspects of the sculp-
ture. The fragments of the human
figure also allow the observer “to
bring their own ideas to the work,”
since the works call for creativity
onthe viewer’s part. The fragmen-
tary aspect of the work allows for
the viewer to imagine the greater
whole of which the figurative
pieces area part. Dasher explained
that this style works similarly to
classical works. He finds classical
sculpture intriguing in thata “piece
can allude to something far
greater.”

His work Tempest, for ex-
ample, combines spiraling forms
of aluminum with marble legs
gracefully posed in a ballerina
stance. According to Dasher, the
