team upset mighty Duke last week wit-
nessed one of the biggest wins in David-
son soccer history. The win highlights
Davidson’s constant improvement in
soccer. Coach Charlie Slagle continues
to bring in talented freshmen and the pro-
gram moves slowly toward making teams
like Duke peers instead of powerful bul-
lies.

While Davidson edges toward the
higher reaches of NCAA soccer, most
Davidson students know virtually noth-
ing about the sport. In fact, I would guess
that a large number of Davidson students
had never seen a soccer game before
watching the Wildcats in action. To
Americans as a whole, soccer is still a
foreign sport.

Outside the United States, soccer
reigns as king. Every nation in Europe
and South America has a soccer league
and play runs approximately from Oc-
tober through April. What makes soccer
and interesting sport is its international
appeal. Since every nation plays soccer,
international competition comes natur-
ally. The European Cup, for example, is

tion’s league. Im America, many have
thought it would be a good idea to have
the best American baseball team play the
Japanese champion in a real World
Series. In Europe, bunches of interna-
tional tournaments take place annually.
Unfortunately, soccer’s chief claim
to fame lately has been fan riots. Last
May, 38 people died and 437 more were
injured at the European Cup final at Brus-
sels between Liverpool of England and
Juventes of Turin, Italy. The tragedy oc-
cured after a group of “hooligans” from
the Liverpool fan section attacked the
Juventes section, causing a panic and a
rush toward the lone exit by the Juventes
fans. The mad rush crushed the victims
and led to further fan violence before the
game even sarted. Officials ordered the
game to be played because they feared
more violence if the game was post-
poned.
The terrible irony of this tragedy is
that soccer’s most glorious event short of
the World Cup would have gone almost
completely unnoticed in the United
States had the riots not occurred. The fact
that two of the world’s most prestigious

soccer clubs: were playing for Europe’s
most hallowed award would not have
been enough to draw the attention of
America’s sports public. What a shame.

I have often wondered if soccer will
ever “make it” in America. The recent
demise of the North American Soccer
League did not help soccer’s chances in
the United States. However, mismanage-
ment played a big part in the NASL’s
downfall. At the grass roots level, soccer
continues to grow. I have always thought
that if a group of dedicated owners
formed a small league of teams manned
by strictly American players (Americans
would be less expensive than foreign im-
ports and would attract long-term follow-
ings), soccer would flourish if given
time.

Soccer has a disadvantage not shared
by football, basketball, or baseball in that
it doesn't lend itself to television. Soccer
games don’t have time-outs, two minute
warnings, or space between innings to
sneak in commercials. For a sport to suc-
ceed today, television money is essential.
The NASL’s brief contract with ABC
television was the high point of American
soccer. Unfortunately, no one watched

The Wonderful World Of Soccer

" [a tournament of the winners of each na-

the games, ABC pulled out, and the
NASL went into a fatal tailspin.

If Americans gave soccer a chance, I
think soccer would succeed. Soccer can
be fast and furious, smooth and graceful,
powerful and rough or all of the above.
There is something for everyone. In addi-
tion, a point in soccer is an achievement,
a work of art painstakingly compiled by
an offense struggling to beat a defense
determined not to fall. Many sports in
America suffer from an abundance of
scoring (NFL _ football, especially).
Touchdowns are a-dime-a-dozen, goals
are treasures.

My plea: watch some soccer. See
every match you can at Davidson. Then,
when the sport has you in its grip, you
will be ready for this summer and the
World Cup, sports’ most watched event.
(Yes, even more that the Olympics!)
Anyone who watches the World Cup
with an open mind cannot help but be-
come a soccer fan.

Remember last Friday. Remember
the excitement as Davidson turned back
Duke’s unrelenting offense again and
again and again. Davidson |, Duke 0!
Soccer truly is a great sport!

Hills Propel Women, Slow Men Cross Country

By RAND HARTSELL
Maybe someone forgot to tell
Lynchburg’s women runners that

they had to ‘race Davidson last —

Saturday morning. On the other
hand, Davidson’s men’s team
probably wishes they hadn’t been
told that they were supposed to
race after the women finished.

° Sophomore Kappa Peddy led
Davidson’s jaunt through the rol-
ling hillside (well, more like
mountains) of Lynchburg, Vir-
ginia as they compiled a nearly
perfect score of 17 points compare
to Lynchburg’s 42. (In cross-
country, a team’s individual
finishing places are added to de-
termine the team’s score, with the
low score winning. Since five run-
ners score, the lowest score a team
can have is 15, or places one
through five.) Only one Lyn-

chburg runner was able to break
up the Cats monopoly on finish
places. Senior captain Judy Dal-
ton ‘and sophomores Laura Fan-
nin, Morrow Reeves and Debbie
Niles occupied places two, three,
five and six respectively.
Lynburg’s murderous course
turned out to be the only aspect of
the race which offered Davidson’s
women any challenge. “It was the
hardest course we’ll run all year,”
said women’s coach Sarah Patter-
son. Fortunately, the women’s
team had another week of training
under thier belts or else the course
might have gotten the better of
them. “One week of hard training
made a noticeable difference,”
Patterson continued. “Kappa and
Judy were a lot closer together this
past weekend than the weekend
before. I expect everyone to get

stronger and stronger as the sea-
son goes on.”

Already, Fannin’s — perfor-
mance in prective is responding to
the speed work the Cats have
done. Speedwork, for you
armchair runners, is not the incor-
poration of amphetamines into
one’s training program. It’s a
series of runs at a faster than nor-
mal pace, designed to train a run-
ner’s cardiovascular system to
handle the fast pace of racing. The
recovery periods between runs
merit the regimine its runner's
verancular term — “intervals.”

The men’s team may wish it
had use amphetamines. Senior
captain Frank Hague turned in a
good performance, finishing
fourth overall. Both Roanoke and
Lynchburg, however, ran tight
team races, with Roanoke demon-

strating its collective prowess
over the five-mile course. They
racked up only 24 points, placing
first, second, sixth, seventh, and
eighth. Senior Rob Watkins agian
anchored the second postion for
Davidson; but he was more than
40 seconds off Hague’s pace. “I
was happy with my race consider-
ing the hills,” Watkins said.

A shake-up characterized the
next few positions with freshmen
Bill Whitfield moving up a notch
to the number three spot. Senior
Taylor Simpson, sophomore Bill
Breidenstine and juniors Greg
Foreman and Emil Cekada
rounded out the Cats top seven.

Unfortunately, the Cats will
lose Simpson to shin splints for to-
morrow’s race at The Citadel in
Charleston, S.C. Western
Carolina and host The Citadel will

be out of the Cats reach. Davidson
has an outside chance to avenge
their loss to Furman of two weeks
ago. Success in that endeavor will
depend on Watkins and Foreman
staying with Hague, and on Whit-
field’s, Breidenstine's — and
Cekada’s ability to pull each other
along. Coach Sterling Martin
hopes freshmen Bob Cornish
(sorry about the typo last week
Bob) has recovered form the flu
bug that afflicted him during the
week preceeding the Lynchburg
meet. His and sophomore Chris
Fisher's presence will also have to
be felt in light of Simpson's ab
sence.

The women’s team doen't an-
ticipate any difficulty with their
lone opponent, Furman, with the
exception of Patterson's sister,
one of the Furman runners.
