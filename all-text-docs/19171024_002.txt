Liberty Loan Day.
Davidson College Day follows.

Let pure speech liberate you from a
sordid vocabulary.

“One's religion is what he is most
interested in.” —Barric.

“In every play it matters little what
the author has conceived and written, if
it is not vitalized by the author.”—H. A.
Jones.

“If you want to ‘get somewhere,’ go
in one direction. If you undertake
something, do that one thing.”—F. W.
Woolworth.

“Bankers find it safer to loan $10,000
to a man who employs system in his busi-
ness, than $1,000 to a man who does
nat."—A. W. Shaw.

“When you want to ‘cuss,’ go to whis-
tling.” This piece of philosophy was
found written on a page of “Classical
Moralists.” Probably some alumnus
will know about its authorship.

He whose blood does not rankle by
hearing Dr. McConnell’s exposition of
“Our Case Against Germany” is a slack-
er. This talk is lucid, direct, intensely
patriotic and ffould be heard by every
American.

This is a weck of too. many good
things. “It never rains but what it
pours”—which is reversed for the weck.

DAVIDSON COLLEGE DAY.

Governor Bickett, the great War Gov-
ernor—of North Carolina. comes to us
tomorrow on our memorial day. He is
an entertaining speaker and we are hon-
ored to have him for this occasion. Prob-
ably no state executive is more alive to
the peculiar condition of the day than
is Mr. Bickett.

Ihe DAVIDSONIAN, October 24, 1917

It is regretted that the uniforms are BUSINESS AS LIFE WORK

not here so that he could review our
cnilitary student body.

Dr. Wright, a former ranchman, the
Indian evangelis*, is a power. He holds
‘is audience while he gives it a lucid.
sowerful and prac.ical sermon. His
personality is winning, giving force and
zarnestness to his direct appeals, He
has all the sagacity and intensity which
‘s characteristic of his nationality.

In his opening sermon he endeared
himself to all who heard his plea that
zach one examine himself. He says that
he is “glad to be with men.” There is
a warm and hearty welcome for Dr.
Wright and Mr. Young, who is making
the services more delightful with hi:
solos and by his leadership in the song
‘ervice,

THE FACULTY QUOTA.

The Davidson College Faculty is cer-
‘ainly doing its bit in service, Dr. Ful-
tun is actively engaged in raising a great
Y. M. C. A. fund. His service to this
committee will be invaluable. Dr. Lin-
gle, formerly of the faculty, is now in
Y. M. C. A. work near “the top.” Dr.

. W. McConnell, formerly of the fac-
ulty, has been released to become a spe-
cialist (one of twenty in the United
States) in the great base hospital at Co-
tumbia. President Martin is Chairman
of the State Committe of Research. He
is intensely interested in this work, Dr.
J. M. McConnell is doing a great deal
in stirring citizens to a higher pitch of
patriotism and is aiding in every possi-
ole way to stimulte even greater interest
in the Liberty Loan Fund Bond being
launched. Other faculty members are
advising students as to their position.

DR. FULTON CONNECTED
WITH Y. M. C. A. WORK.

With Dr. Lingle in France and Dr.
Fulton at home in America, both work-
ing for the Y. M. C. A., Davidson Col-
.ege is furnishing her share of workers
.o that organization. Dr. Lingle is do-
ing the regular Y. M. C. A. work ia
France, and Dr. Fulton is connected
with the raising of a $300,000 fund here
in America. He is on the committee
formed for the purpose of raising this
amount, and is looking after the exten-
sion of this great campaign. Associated
with him in this publicity work is Mr.
Baker, of Charlotte. Dr. (Fulton is
very interested in this work, and is de-
voting a great deal of time to it. As
Dr. Martin is on the “North Carolina
Conmnittee of Research,” and Dr. J. W.
McConnell in the medical corps of the
army, and Dr. Lingle and Dr. Fulton
doing Y. M. C. A. work, there is a great
patriotic service being done by the fac-
ulty of Davidson College.

ELISE HIGH SCHOOL
CLUB IS ORGANIZED

On Saturday night the Elise High
School Club met and organized for the
year. The following officers were clect-
ed: M. A. Thompson, President; A.
Currie, Vice-President; F. L. Knight.
Secretary; W. C. Knight, ‘“Pecuniae
‘Conservator ;” L. L. Edgerton, Band-
master; E. N. Booker, Toastmaster; V.
D. Johnson, Feminist.

After the business meeting the club
nartook of a delightful repast. After
this Tohnson and Edgerton led some
popular and college songs. The pep was
the merrier because they were accom-
panied by the harp and violin. The
meeting closed with a yell for “feed”
and one for “Elise.”

O. J. Thies, Jr., 18, and C. W. Rob-
inson, ’21, spent Sunday at their homes
in Charlotte.

DISCUSSED BY MR. SPEIR

Mr. Speir, of Charlotte, addressed the
Y. M. C. A. Thursday night as the
speaker in the life work series to be given
this fall. Mr. Speir’s subject was “The
Christian Business Man.” He began by
saying that all should be acquainted with
the happenings of the business world
Even those not contemplating business
as 1 life’s work should know men whe
are really accomplishing things. A mark-
‘d change is taking place in the business
methods of today. A new consc‘ousnes
’s coming to outstanding men. Financial
‘ings and other marked men are begin-
ning to feel that they are only trustees
4 modern Christian business man has
his old feeling of selfishness crowded out
‘Sv a real desire for service. Mr. Speir
‘ald of several Christian business men
‘vho have given up large salaries to ac-
“ept much smaller, ones and in some
cases even none at all, in order to satisfv
shat desire to serve. . Notable “were the
stories of Mr. Bryan, a brilliant news-
naper editor, and Mr. Crossett, a very
successful shoe manufacturer, wh geve
up their incomes and orospects for bright
futures that they might better serve their
fellow countrvmen in arms. Such serv+
‘ce is inspired by the teachings of the
createst of all servers of mankind. The
orinciples of Jesus are creeping into busi-
ness more and mote and the greatest
and most success‘! business men are the
ones who follow His teachings. Mr.
Speir closed by appealing for manhood
urging all to have the courage and
strength to choose lives like these big
men and serve their fellows by living up
to the Golden Rule in business. ‘Let
“s not trust in uncertain riches,” said

Mr. Speir, “but let us seek to obtain)

the exceeding riches of grace thru Christ
¢ ”
Tesus.

MUCH INTEREST SHOWN
IN MINISTERIAL BAND

The subject under discussion at the
Ministerial Band meeting last Sunday
was what a man sacrificed when he en-
tered the ministry. The discussion was
led by D. R. Freeman and H. B. Dendy.
who pointed out that altho men might
have to gite up some ambition of their
own, or some future their parents might
wish for them, it was really a privilege
to labor for the Master in the ministry.
In the open discussion that followed the
same point was stressed that as the joys
of the ministry so far outweigh any sacri-
fices that might be made, it was a great
privilege to enter the ministry.
