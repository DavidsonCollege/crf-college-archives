The Way of Law

Boushee says economic laws are sure
funny. He can’t to save his life understand :
When more eggs are laid, eggs are cheaper;
but when more bricks are laid, bricks are

higher.

Fire or Smoke?

, where it was smoke that overcame a fireman

fair sex told Okey Allison if he would re-

| Along with John Bryan in his carpentry

|an able assistant. As a token of the esteem
| and affection of the minstrels, they are

them in their respective memory books as

Two of the royal musicians, Finn and
Seago, in Greenville, while walking on West
Washington Street, culminating in front of
Southern depot, got lost looking for a street
running parallel to the depot.

John Simpson states he couldn’t sleep in
the Gresham in Spartanburg. He had his
door locked and also his window, yet every
time that a train passed by he got a cinder
in his eye.

Gibson also thanked the clerk of the same
hostelry for allowing him to keep his suit
cases in his ice box.

About the only motto on the trip was
chanted every morning at breakfast. The
breakfast consisted of two eggs, a glass of
milk, and two doughnuts. The motto ran
like this: Adam and Eve on a raft—wreck
them, coax the cow once and washers for
two nuts.

Hurd enjoyed the whole trip except the
| Gastonia reception. ‘The house was too big,
|and worst of all, his feet wouldn't fit that
wax floor.

The quartet, Brown, Jones, Mcleod and
| Wilson, were presented with a house at G.
| W. C.—a brick at a time.

Fraser, at the dinner at G. W. C., escorted
a young lady to dinner and tried his taurus

| to find out that she was the college dean.

A new course is to be added to the G. W.
C. curriculum next year: “How to appreci-
ate a performance.” It will consist mostly
of how to register and show delight.

Wilson still thought he was a 100 fa-
thoms deep when he pitched his masterpiece
“The Rough Ocean,” written on the high

#/C’s, at Charlotte.

Shorty Martin hibernated on the whole
trip. He fell in love at Converse and before
he reached Greenville his batting average

Newberry wiped out the only defeat ‘on her
schedule, a 40-32 win by Furman by turning
the tables with a 26-12 victory. Newberry
challenged the Tigers but Clemson refused
a game on the ground that they needed a
rest before the tournament. When you re-

excuse is hardly valid and anyhow the de-

it look like she deserves the rag.

Once upon a time the advertising manager
of a well known publication asked a man,
“Ever have your hat blown off?”

“Yes.”

“What blew it off?”

“The wind!”

“Did you see the wind?”

“No!” ;

“Well advertising, like the wind, is an in-
visible force—you can’t see it but you can
and will see ‘the results, just as you saw
