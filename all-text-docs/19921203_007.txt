Richardson Field Ready For NCAA Final Four Action

By Tom Koonce

DavidsonCollege’s
Richardson Field has had a series
of facelifts in the past two years,
alterations which helped to bring
the NCAA Soccer Final Four to
the campus for 1992 and 1993. The
stadium serves as the home field
for both Davidson men’s soccer
and football games. Its normal ca-
pacity is 5,350, but additional
stands along the sidelines and in
the end zones have been brought in
for the tournament. The extra seats
allowed 7,840 tickets to be sold for
the Final Four.

Until the fall of 1991, only
football games were held on
Richardson Field. But during the
summer of that year three lanes of
the track surrounding the field were
torn up and replaced with turf to
make the field wide enough for
soccer. Men’s and women’s soc-

cer games were then held on the
expanded field in 1991.

This year, several more
changes were made to the field and
Stadium to prepare for the NCAA
Tournament. A new scoreboard
was erected at one end of the field,
equipped to handle both soccer
and football games. The new
scoreboard now has a message
board and reports statistics for shots
on goal, saves, fouls and corrier
kicks. Two new light standards
were erected, which boosted the
illumination of the field to roughly
100,000 candlepower. A TV stand
was also constructed near the
pressbox to facilitate coverage of
the Final Four.

The field itself has received
extensive work during recent
weeks in order to prepare it for this
weekend’s action. Men’s soccer
coach Charlie Slagle said that the

field “is in very good shape, con-
sidering that it’s been in use all
year [for football and men’s soc-
cer]. The field will be in good
playing condition. It’s amazing
what they [the grounds crew] have
done in sucha short period of time.”

Two weeks ago Davidson
hosted Coastal Carolina in a sec-
ond round tournament game on
Richardson Field. The field was
wet before the game and then a
downpour during the game left it
in bad shape after the wear and tear
of the afternoon’s play. This pre-
sented problems for the grounds
crew, but difficulties they were
prepared to handle.

The field was fertilized,
mowed androlled to try and getout
any divots on the playing area.
There was also a top-dress mix
applied to getrid of some of the big
divots from the Davidson-Coastal

game. Grounds superintendent
George Morris said, ““We’ve been
trying to get the turf in as good a
condition as possible...It’s been

ready for the tournament.”

‘egidence,

“We establish much of our personal
identity through a sense of place ... The
longer I live, the more 1am convinced

that Davidson, having captured our
imagination in a certain season of life,

then provides us with a vision for all the
seasons yet to come... Something there

is about this place —at least in possibility —
that teaches us how to age while staying
young, that invites us to grow long after

our first recollections are nigh erased by
later images, that encourages us to believe
the story will continue long after the

images have begun to fade.”
