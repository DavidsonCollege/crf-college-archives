ST. PAUL, Minn. (CPS) -- A
play previously banned in the
former Soviet Union will make
its debut at a U.S. college after
student actors have spent months
working with consultants as well
as a director.

For its production of “Dear
Elena Sergeevna,” Sears
Eldredge, chairman of Macalas-
ter College’s dramatic arts de-
partment, asked a Soviet student
and a Russian professor who is
an expert on Soviet affairs to
work with his cast to help them
better understand Soviet society.

Eldredge says the play was
extremely challenging for his stu-
dent actors because of its inten-
sity and its message.

lay, written by Ludmilla
Razumovskaya in 1980, tells the
story of four high school math
students who hold their teacher
hostage with hopes of getting
final exam answers.

The play, which has been
performed in the former Soviet
Union and Europe since per-
estroika, will open Oct. 11 at
Macalester and run through Oct.
19.

Freshman Policies

Reviewed At Citadel
CHARLESTON, S.C. (CPS) --
The Citadel is undergoing a
“healthy evaluation” after its

president asked the military-

school’s governing board to re-
view the Fourth Class system.
The system, found atall U.S.

men to follow a rigorous drilling
and study schedule and says they
should be referred to as “knobs.”
The system forbids hazing, de-
fined as laying hands on a cadét.

“We just want to make sure
that the system is serving what
it’s supposed to do,” said Col.
Ben Legare, public relations di-
rector.

The system received some
recentattention because 57 fresh-
men have withdrawn from school
so far this year. Although that
number reflects the yearly aver-
age of departing first-year stu-
dents, the departing students
gained more attention because
“they are high visibility students
as athletes,” Legare said.

The school found that one
outgoing athlete was punched by
another cadet and is trying to
identify the cadet who commit
ted the assault. :

Alumnus Thomas Frist, Presi-
dent of the American Leprosy
Mission (ALM), returned to
Davidson on Wednesday to dis-
cuss curing leprosy in developing
nations. While leprosy is not a
significantproblem in Western na-
tions, it ranks as a major public
health problem in Asia, Africa,
Latin America, and the Pacific Is-
lands. There are thought to be ap-
proximately ten million lepers in
the world, with cases in every na-
tion.

Leprosy, also known as
Hansen’s Disease, is caused by the
bacillus Mycobacterium Leprae.
Spread by dropletinfection through
sneezing and coughing, the bacte-
riacan live outside the human body
for up to three weeks. ‘Once the
disease is contracted, the incuba-
tion period lasts from two to five
years before the first signs are

socialism would “beat out” capi-
talism because of its superior po-
litical ideology and its more effi-
cient economic policies. During

the cold war, Williams explained, '

Kruschev was genuinely optimis-
tic aboutsocialism’s preeminence.
The Soviet’s leadership in space
travel and the United State’s fail-
ure in Vietnam were among inci-
dents which deepened Kruschev’s
optimism.

In the evening session, Dr.
Gaddis cited reasons for the cold

detectable. Leprosy first becomes
apparent in a small patch on the
skin which is insensitive to touch.
If not treated, the disease attacks
the mucous membranes, nerves,
and skin of its victim and may
eventually lead to blindness, crip-
pling, and deformity.

Fortunately, a cure has been
found for Hansen’s Disease.
Through a multi-drug therapy of
three antibiotics, leprosy may be
cured in as few as six months.
While the cure is relatively inex-
pensive, most of those afflicted
with the disease are unable to pay
for their treatment.

Founded in 1906, the American
Leprosy Mission is a Christian
organization which works with
Hansen's Disease victims through-
out the world,:.As, President, Frist
spoke of ALM’s major foci. First,
the ALM hopes to eliminate lep-
rosy as a major public health prob-
lem by the year 2000 by making
the cure available to all who are in
need.

The second major focus in-
volves the physical problems of

war’s collapse. Among these were
adesire for freedom among people
living under socialist regimes and
the maturation of leaders on both
sides of the cold war. Gaddis be-
lieves that Reagan and Gorbachev
are the leaders most responsible
for the cold war’s demise.

Dr. Williams is a graduate of
Princeton University. He received
his masters and doctoral degrees
at Columbia University. Dr. Gad-
dis received all of his education at
the University of Texas.

Frist Speaks On Leprosy In Poor Nations

those already afflicted with the
disease. As leprosy desensitizes
the victim’s nerves, many disabili-
ties found in lepers are results of
the person’s inability to feel pain
when he is getting hurt. For ex-
ample, someone who has lost all
feeling in her hand may not be
aware when it is being burnt on the
stove. In these common settings of
abject poverty, infection easily sets
in, and the person may even lose
her entire hand.

To counteract these problems,
the ALM teaches prevention meth-
ods for these disabilities among
lepers. The ALM also makes pos- .
sible rehabilitation for those al-
ready disfigured by the disease,
and provides low-costaids for those
who have become handicapped.

~The third;major focus of the”
organization involves changing the -
social response to Hansen’s Dis-
ease. Leprosy hasacquired a stigma
as a highly contagious,, devastat-
ing disease. As aresult, lepers were
once .confined to leper colonies
and completely cut off from the
outside world: However, the ALM
hopes to educate society to an
understanding of the disease so
that the stigma will disappear.
While the disease is contagious,
only about five percent of the
population are even susceptible to
infection. Also, if the disease does
develop and is caught in its early
stages, it causes no major prob-
lems.

Due to the stigmas of the past,
Hansen’s Disease victims endure
great psychological sufferings and
feel illogical shame for their dis-
