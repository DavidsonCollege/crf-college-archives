A LOOK AT...

SPORTS

By Bill Godwin

The Unpardonable Sin

OUR READER(S) sometimes write (see Letter to the
Editor on adjacent page). Mr. Elvery tells us that Vice
President Nixon played football at Whittier College.
We'd like to acknowledge that fact. But it must be added
that Nixon was cut from the squad his sophomore year.
Nevertheless, he might be of some help to the Davidson
football team. The United States has no need of his ser-
vices.

ALL SORTS of reasons have been offered to explain
Davidson's lack of success in football. Could it be that
the boys are undernourished? You know, of course,
where they eat. We eat there, too. And the peanut butter
was never better :

The Way To Victory

THE FROSH football team did it the hard way last
Friday. Leading Wingate by 13 points, they lined up for
the extra point attempt. Trouble was, there were only
16 of them. Kicker Jim Fuller laid his foot to the ball

but a Bulldog defender stood in its path. As luck would
have it, the ball passed under his arm and split the up
riglits. The 14th point turned out to be the margin of
victory, since Wingate Y with 13 in the final

has been beaten only twice this season: by VPI’s John
Castagnola and VMIl's Bill Braithwaite. Coach Whittle

told him to stay back and group with his teammates.

The Davidson College soccer team faces Pfeiffer’s

noon, here at Davidson, in an ‘attempt to avenge an October 25th defeat at the hands jj,

of this same Pfeiffer team by a score of 1-0.

This earlier defeat was the
first one inflicted upon the
Wildcats this season: Davidson
now has a record of 5 wins and
2 defeats.

Says Coach Paul Marrotte,
|‘Our boys should really be up
\for this contest, but ‘they’ have
a strong team.
| “They have lost only to U.
|N. C. and Washington and Lee
and will be stronger than when
|we first faced them because of
ithe return from the injured
| list of their best back.
| “In addition Dave Irvin, a
starting wing, was lost to us
for the season in the U.N.C.
game with a knee injury.”

Last Friday the = ‘Cats lost
their second of the season to
the University of North Caro-

lina by a margin of 2 to 1 in
a double. overtime.

The first half of this contest
was scoreless and Carolina
scratched first with a goal in
the third quarter.

Davidson surged back to tie
the score early in the final
quarter on a pass from Mike
Laughlin to Arnold Kroner, who
scored the goal.

ed and with just one and a

Harriers Prep For State
Meet After Loss To VMI

The Davidson cross country team closed out a successful season Wednesday}

with a loss to VMI, 22-39

It gave the ’Cats a 7-2 record going into the state meet in Raleigh Monday.

There the Wildcats will be
contesting with Duke and Caro-
lina for the championship.

FIRST PLACE?

“I'm priming Sterling Martin
to win first place,” said Coach
Heath Whittle.

The Blue Devils, defending
champs, lost their two top boys
last season. UNC ‘has at least
one good runner.

Whittle expects “a_ terrific
battle with West Virginia and
VMI” in the Southern Confer-

ence meet November 21 in Wil-
liamsburg.

Wednesday's race was noth-
ing short of fabulous.

ONE-HALF SECOND

Martin put out his best ef-
fort of the season, finishing one-
half a second behind VMI's Bill
Braithwaite, whose time was
was 22:02.5.

The two runners ran the third
and fourth fastest races ever
recorded on the VMI course.

Whittle Drops Duties
For Semester Of Study

Davidson track and cross
country coach Heath Whittle is
planning a sabbatical leave sec-
ond semester to study the track,
physical education, and intra-
mural sports programs of three
Southern schools.

The first stop in Whittle's
southward migration will be in
Atlanta at Emory University.

will spend this time taking
courses in gymnastics and phy-
sical education.

Overall, Whittle expects the
trip to be stimulating. “I’m
looking forward to it,” he states
contentedly. “It’s going to en-
able me to suggest a better in-
tramural program here at Dav-
idson, and also to do a better

job with physical education.

“We may be able to offer
an advanced course in gym-
nastics, for instance; whereas,
we now can give only the regu-
lar beginning course.”

“After thirty years one needs
to get out and get some new
ideas,” ‘he continues lightly.
“Pm looking forward to this
trip.”

Coach Whittle expects Coach
Shoe and Coach Thrift will fill
in his vacancy during spring

VMI's Scarbrough copped the

As for the conference meet,

have lost to West Virginia, the
best bet for first place.

An outstanding example of
Lt. Col. Bill Adam's policy for
the ROTC department to help
Davidson all it can is Capt.
Donald Threlkeld, newly-arriv-
ed armor man from Ft. Knox,

Threlkeld (the name is Norse,
mixed with English and Scotch)
has the usual teaching duties,
but in addition is rifle coach
and freshman football line

Head Coach Bill Dole ex-
pressed his appreciation for
Threlkeld’s coaching job.

On the rifle squad, Threlkeld
works with Sgt. Jim McCurry,
whom he calls “a tremendous
organizer. The boys believe in
him.”

Davidson's shoulder - to-shou-

first win here last Friday over
Clemson, 1378-1373. Wofford

The Wildcats, defending Wes-

Threlkeld had praise for Don

finished 1-2 against Clemson.
