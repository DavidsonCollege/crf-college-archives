Venereal disease fairly

widespread at Davidson

Chlamydia bacterium can cause pain, sterility

By TRIPP HELMS

As many as 50 percent of
Davidson’s sexually active stu-
dents have or have had chlamydia,
a sexually transmitted disease,
estimates Davidson College Phy-
sician Audrey Shields.

Although this does not repre-
sent an “epidemic,” Shields says
that three to four male students are
being treated for the disease each
week at the college infirmary.

There are somewhat fewer
cases treated among female stu-
dents, says Shields, but this is
because the disease is harder to
detect in women. Also, many
women see their own private
doctors instead of coming to the
college infirmary.

This worries Shields because
some “older doctors” may not
know to look for chlamydia be-

' cause it has just recently become

prevalent in sexually active

people.
Some sexually active Davidson

students recognize chlamydia’s
prevalence on campus. One stu-
dent remarked, “Yeah, it gets
around. You sleep with two or
three people and you’ ve got it. It’s
almost like catching a cold.”

Many women who have ch-
lamydia spread it it unwittingly
because most woman show no
symptoms, The few women that
do show symptoms may experi-
ence pelvic pain and irregularities
in menstruation.

Symptoms are more prevalent
in males, showing upin 75 percent
of infected men, but Shields says
that men often disregard them.
The most common symptom of
chlamydia among males i is pain in
urination.

A man who has chlamydia can
develop urethritis, an infection of

common, urethritis can lead to an
inflammation of the testicles that
causes sterility.

Chlamydia is more dangerous
to women infected with the dis-
ease. It begins as an infection of
the cervix and can move through
the uterus to the fallopian tubes.
Scar tissue from the infection can
block the fallopian tubes, which
may result in infertility.

Eleven thousand American
women become sterile each year
because of pelvic inflammatory
disease, another possible conse-
quence of untreated chlamydia.

The disease is completly cur-
able when. treated with antibiot-
ics. Because itis so hard to detect,
Shields treats the disease if there is
any suspicion of i its presence ina
patient.

Students face computer

shortages in end-of-term crunch

By SUSAN PEARSALL

The end of aterm is usually characterized by
excessive student activity at the Computer
Services Center as the mad rush to turn in
_ papers by the Friday 5:00 deadline begins.
. This term, it has been more difficult than ever
to type a paper or to get it printed at the
Computer Center because of the school’s rela-
tively small supply of IBM PCs and the ever-
increasing demand for the computers and
printers.

The situation has become worse because the
school’s four printers have been breaking

down throughout the year. Only two printers are
currently available, and often a student must
wait for a half hour to print out a paper.
According to the Center’s director, John
Casey, a request is pending in the school’s
budget (to be approved in March) for funds with

. which to purchase more public-use PCs and

more printers. The same request was made last
year and was approved, but no funds have yet
been made available, and the school has bought
