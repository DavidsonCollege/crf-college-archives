IRENE JORDAN

lrene Jordan fo Sing
In Concert Next Week

Ifene Jordan, brilliant young
American soprano, hailed by con-
ductors and critics alike as an
artist in the great classic tradition,
will sing in Chambers Auditorium,
Davidson College, on Friday eve-
ning, April 30, at 8:15 p.m., in the
last concert of the 1953-54 David-
son College Artist Series.

From the time she began study-
ing music at the age of 3% until
her Metropolitan Opera debut in
1046, she has aimed for learning
rather than limelight. Born in
Birmingham, Alabama, Irene Jor-
dan was one of ten children in a
completely musical family. “My
father was a-music teacher and
my mother a violinist,” she says.
“All the children played instru-
ments. We were practically an or-
chestra just in ourselves. I was
the pianist.”

During the two seasons following
her Metropolitan Opera debut,
Miss Jordan sang regularly over
the NBC radio network. In 1047
the singer had a successful season
with the Opera Nacional in Mexi-
co City. She retired temporarily
from public concerts in order to
develop her superb upper range,
and this year she emerged as a
new operatic and concert star.

As of this season Miss Jordan is
singing as a soprano, rather than
a@ mezzo-soprano. Kirsten Flagstad
made this same change in the midst
of her career and both critics and
‘audience, upon hearing Miss Jor-
dan’s new voice, feel that she might
very well equal, if not surpass,

. the great Flagstad’s success.

Highlights of Irene Jordan's
concert in Davidson will be “Man
is for the Woman Made” arranged
by Benjamin ‘Britten, “Have You
Seen But a Whyte Lillie Grow,” a
group of German lieder by Richard
Strauss and Wolf, “In the Silence
of Night” by Rachmaninoff, and
arias from “Ernani” by Verdi and
from “The Abduction from the

Seraglio” by Mozart.

To End On

The 1954 Fine Arts Festival,
which had a successful first week,
has three very promising programs
remaining to fill out the festival.
Both attendance at most programs
and the audience participation at
many were the healthy results of
a well-planned festival by Mr.
Moore and the Fine Arts Com-
mittee.

On Monday, April 26, Louise Nel-
son Pfohl, a member of the faculty
of the Davidson College Music De-
partment will be presented in a
concert in Chambers Auditorium
at 8:15 p.m. by the Gamma Kappa
Chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia,
national honorary music fraternity.

Mrs. Pfohl will play a Haydn
“Sonata in D Major,” the Brahms’
“Variations and Fugue on a Theme
by Handle, Op. 24,” a group of
Chopin “Etudes,” and the “Noc-
turne in F-sharp Major, Op. 15,
No. 2.” Included on the program
will be compositions of Rachmanin-
off, and contemporary numbers by
Vittorie Giaunini and Paul Hinde-
mith.

"54 Fine Arts Festival

Thursday

A charming and gracious artist,
Louise Nelson Pfohl has appeared
in concerts with the Michigan
Symphony, the Charlotte Sym-
phony, Transylvania Faculty Or-
chestra and Concert Band, David-
son College Concert Band, and has
appeared in numerous solo and en-
semble programs throughout the
South. Louise Nelson Pfohl is the
wife of James Christian Pfohl, con-
ductor of the Charlotte and Jack-
sonville Symphony Orchestras.

On Tuesday night, April 27, Mr.
Harry Davis will present an in-
formal lecture on Contemporary
Drama in the College Union Ball-
room at 8:15 p.m. Mr. Davis is pro-
fessor of Dramatic Art at the Uni-
versity of North Carolina and is
the Associate director of the
“Playmakers.”

The brilliant directing which he
has applied in producing “Unto
These Hills” has established him
as “America’s outstanding director
in the field of outdoor drama.

Le Cercle Francais
Holds Tuesday Meet

Le Cercle Franeais, the honorary
fraternity for students especially
interested in French, held its
monthly meeting on Tuesday, April
13.

The meeting was opened by the
roll call and reading of the pre-
vious meeting's minutes, Norman
Johnson, president of the frater-
nity, then presided over the dis-
cussion of business, the main item
of interest being a proposed din-
ner at Chez Montet in Charlotte.

A committee was appointed to
look into the matter and to pick
a date which would be convenient
for most members. There was a
possibility that the dinner would
be the concluding meeting of the
school year.

The program began with read-
ings of French poetry by members
of the French 32 class. Students
taking part in the readings were
Bill Kuykendall, Joe Gaskin, Earl
Lewis, Jack Crymes, John Harmon,
and Fred Myers.

Bob Crutchfield then gave an
interesting account of his trip to
Europe in the summer of 1953.
His talk was complemented with
some beautiful slides in full color
which he took while in Europe.

The meeting was concluded by
various French songs, refresh-
ments prepared by Mrs. Watts and
Mrs. Goldiere, and informal con-
versation among the members,

diplomas to be awarded to grad-
uating members in good standing.
Tommy Thompson was welcomed
as a new member by the society.

President Hasty announced that
officers for the fall semester will
be elected at the meeting of May
3, and expressed his hopes for a
sizeable attendance that night.

Martin Foil and Henry Brock-
mann were elected marshals to
represent the society in the ap-
proaching commencement activi-
ties.

The program for the evening
consisted of the presentation of
papers by two of the recent
initiates, John Hiers and Bill Mar-
tin. Hier’s discourse concerned
some of the traditional grievances
of the Davidson student, while Mar-
tin offered a short short-story,
Seaburg’s Politics.

Zack Kilpatrick rounded out a
stimulating evening with an im-
promptu presentation of one of
his most recent achievements in
the realm of biological sciences.

annual Awards Day ceremony in
chapel Tuesday morning. A number
of other students also were recog-
nized for outstanding work in
scholarship, athletics, and religion.

Gray was presented the Tommy
Peters Memorial Award by Prof.
H. E. Fulcher for best typifying
the spirit of Davidson. Tommy
Peters, during his brief pre-World
War II college career, was recog-
nized as one of the outstanding
athletes and campus leaders in
Davidson history. He was killed
during the war, and the award was
established to recognize the spirit
which he exemplified.

President Cunningham presented
the Agnes Sentelle Brown Scholar-
ship to Leighton Green for show-
ing outstanding promise in leader-
ship, scholarship, and character.

Amended this Week | Will Speak af Vespe

A substitute amendment has been
presented to the Student Council
by more than fifty signers of the
original amendments to the Student
Body Constitution.The amendment,
which is to be inserted in place
of Amendment I of the petition
of April 9th, reads as follows:

“In all matters arising under
the Honor System or the Stu-
dent Body Regulations, the
Student Government shall have
complete jurisdiction to try
all cases. It shall be illegal for
the Student Government to re-
fer any such matter to any

‘other authority.”

It was discovered in after-vesper
discussions by the proponents of
the amendments that some-changes
were needed in Amendment I. The
substitute amendment more clear-
ly brings out the fact that it is not
in contradiction to the by-laws of
the trustees, and also makes clear
that appeal to the faculty is not
denied.

The controversial amendment

formerly read as follows:

“In all matters arising un-
der the Honor System or the
Student Body Regulations, the
Student Government shall have
final and complete jurisdic-
tion. It shall be illegal for the
Student Government to refer
any such matter to any other
authority. If the actions of the
Student Government in any
such matters should be re-
versed by any other authority,
it shall be mandatory for the

the local company, directed pro-
ceedings in the presence of the
assembled regiment. The entire
parade was given in honor of
Scabbard and Blade.

Selection of Scabbard and Blade

Dr. James H. Robinson will
speak at the Vesper Service on
Sunday evening, April 25. He has
a national reputation as a popu-
lar speaker in civic and education-
al gatherings.

Dr. Robinson was born in Knox-
ville, Tennessee, and graduated
from Lincoln University, Pennsyl-
vania, at the head of his class in
1935. He was president of the
class of 1938 at Union Theological
Seminary, New York City, from
which he received his B.D. degree.

After being ordained into the
ministry, he founded the Church
of the Master and the Morningside
Community Center in Harlem. He
started with a nucleus of fewer
than fifty Negro Christians, and
gradually he has built up the insti-
tution. until it now provides re-
ligious guidance and practical as-
sistance to 2,000 people. Their pro-
gram includes two interracial
camps, a psychiatric clinic, a
nursery, a recreation center, a
credit union, and a co-op store.

In 1951 the Presbyterian Board
of Foreign Missions sent Dr.
Robinson on a special six-month
mission to students in Europe, the
Near East and Asia. He made this
trip in order to encourage
ecumenical thinking and action
among Christians at home and
abroad.

Dr. Robinson is noted as a con-
sultant on racial problems. He
spends a part of each year on
American campuses giving religious
emphasis programs.

He has received numerous
awards and citations from commu-
nity service organizations, and the
honorary degree of Doctor of Hu-
mane Letters from Lincoln Univer-
sity and from the New Schoo! of
Social Research, New York. He
has also received the degree of
Doctor of Divinity from Wooster
College, Wooster, Ohio.

In 1950 Dr. Robinson’s autobiog-
raphy, entitled Road Without Turn
ing, was published.

AFTER-VESPERS DISCUSSION

“America’s Race Problem in In-
ternational Affairs” will be the
subject of an after-vesper discus-
sion this Sunday night led by the
vesper speaker in the student
lounge of the church.

Those who know Dr. Robinson
have often noted that he is even
more powerful and instructive in a
small discussion group than in the
pulpit.

All students are urged to take
advantage of this rare opportunity
to meet and talk informally with
Dr. Robinson after vespers. Coffee
will be served.

Taylor, Baker Head
Two Upper Classes

By BILL STEWART

Balloting today in chapel for all
three classes’ officers resulted in
several positions being decided,
while two will have to be run off
Monday. The rising senior class
elected Tommy Taylor, a Beta from
Jacksonville, Fla., as secretary.
Charlie Cousar and Corky King
will run off the presidential race
Monday. Laey Keesltr, from Char-
lotte, was named vice president
earlier in the week. He is a Kappa
Sig. ,

The rising juniors elected Linny
Baker as president, Phil Koonce,
vice president, and Jeff Smith, sec-
retary-treasurer. Baker, who was
secretary-treasurer of the student
body last year, is from Kannapolis,
N.C. Koonce is from Tarboro, and
both are members of Alpha Tau
Omega social fraternity. Smith is
from Winston-Salem.

The president of next year’s
sophomore class was not decided
in today’s balloting; voters will
choose either Carl Cooper or Tom
Newton in Monday’s elections. Ver-
non Hunter was chosen vice presi-
dent, and Gordon Bondurant de-
feated Jim Kuist for the secretary-
treasurer job.

Candidates for the editorship of
the magazine will speak in chapel
Monday, and voting for the re-
maining class officers and for
freshman advisor, for whom nomi-
nations were made today, is slated
to start the week's elections.

repeat performance this weekend
with no trouble. Still one of the
top dance bands in America, An-
thony has continually broadened
and expanded his repertoire to. in-
clude many more instrumentals,
as well as good danceable music.
Featured vocalists in Anthony’s
band are Marcie Miller and Tommy
Mercer, with the Skyliners and the
Anthony Choir also getting a high
rating in this department.
Anthony, billed as the “Young
Man with a Horn,” is one leader
who believes in strict discipline for
his bandsmen, musically and other-
wise, while they are on the job.
Like the late Glenn Miller, who
gave him his first important job
in 1940 when he was only 168, Ray
is of the opinion that a band must
do more than just play music if
it is to achieve top success.
Because the unprecedented high
overhead of today makes the band
business big and precarious, maes-
tro Anthony rehearses his
musicians hard and forbids such
commonplace occupational prac-
tices as drinking and smoking on
the stand, “because when you're
working you've got to work.”
Surprisingly, the resultant music
is more spirited than in many less
formally managed bands; less sur-
prisingly, the ensemble work of
the Anthony band is crisper and
more precise than the concerted
efforts of musicians whose leaders
believe that nature should be al-
lowed to take its course.
” Even the appearance of the An-
thony aggregation reflects the dis-
cipline set forth by its leader. A
Hollywood radio announcer once
called it “the best-dressed band in
the land.”
