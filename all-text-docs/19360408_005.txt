Has Excellent Chances to En-

John B. Lee, °36. set another
Davidson record. for the pole vault
March_25,. at Furman University.
when he topped his previous jump
of 12 feet 2 inches, made last spring.
with a vault of 12 feet 5 inchés.
Lee won the event at the Green-
ville, S.C, mect at It feet, and
Yontinued jumping until he reached
the ew mark.

Davitigon has had Lee for a pole
vaulter siNee his freshmarm yor
made his ndmerals then, and
had his letter in track both sopho-
more and junior years. While he
has been on the varsity team he
has repeatedly bettered foxmer rec-
ords. Last year an injured ankle
early in the season hindered Nuis
work, but he had gained the recN,
ord of 12 feet 2 inches at the Char-
lotte Invitation Meet previously.

Through high school and college
competition Lee has constantly im-

Last- Sunday evening the David-
son’ students heard the Reverend
A. B. MecClure,: secretary of the
Davidson Y. M. C. A. speaking at
the vesper service,

The Scripture reading was the
fifth chapter of Galatians, begin-
ning with the thirteenth verse, and
the text was taken from the twen-
ty-second and twenty-third verses:
“But the Truit ot the Spirit is love.
kind-
meek-

joy, peace, long — suffering,
ness, goodness, faithfulness,
ness, self-control.”

The ‘speaker opened his sermon
by stating two questions that are
commonly asked today by  non-
Christians. One is “What ditfer-
ence does religion make?” and the
her, “Can religion. make any dilt-
erchce?" These are fair questions
becausa the people who ask them
look at ese who profess to be fol-
lowers of -Ciyist and can.see noth-

proved. His chances this year arc] ’ SE . oes eae
excellent, and he may go to the] is Christ-like Ng their. lives. The
Penn Relays. The state record, world is full of cotguption and the

Church is not doing aSyuuch to re-
lieve this as it should.

In the Scripture lesson thtece are
two word portraits—one of a Onis.
tian and the other of a man Wwith-
out,a religion. The best answer we
can give to these two pertinent
questions is to model oursel¥es af-
ter the one described in the text, and
try to acquire the nine virtues that
are named here. Christians are re-
jated to God and throdgh this re-
lationship come love, joy and peace.
In dealing with our fellow men we
Jearn longsuffering, kindness and
goodness. But if our actions do not
ring true we are painting a cartoon
instead of a portrait. Faithfulness,
meekness, and self - control will
come through our relations with our
inner selves. Each of us is painting
a picture of his own life. What
will yours look like? +

Pranks Played By Nature
Amid Destruction

u

“AN toryado caught the citizens of
Greensboro totally unprepared last
Thursday night as it swept through

the main secgioys of the city in a
‘cKs wide and nearly
hg, causing 13 deaths

path two
two “niles

and damage amounting to over $2.-
250,000. .

Iospitals were taxed to capacity
after the twister. Broken arms and
legs were numerous and there were
100 patients sull in the hospitals
-24 hours after the incident. The
tornado seemed almost in harmony
with a notoriously freakish winter
season in which floods caused un-
told death and destruction,, heavy
rains threw a damper on the ustual-
ly gay early spring, and natives of
South Carolina saw snow as late as
April 3.

The morning after the tornado
found citizens of Greensboro, ap-
parently undaunted by their misfor-
tune, out repairing their wrecked
homes. Trucks and tractors were
ing used to haul off the debris and
wreckage ; hundreds of unemployed
were p ne work cleaning up the
city. .AfteNthe storm, a crowd con-
servatively estimated at — 10,000,
strangely silent, Wironged the area
of destruction. .

In spite of the arin eagedy of
the storm, nature played squie cu-
rious pranks. Miss Beulah kaw:
rence, of 828 Elm street, lived
tell the unusual tale of having been
lifted by the tornado and carried
two blocks with only a few bruises
to have made the journey unpleas-
