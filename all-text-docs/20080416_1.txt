DAVIDSON COLLEGE

os 7 a

Student-initiated
theme halls expand

By BriAN MorAN
Staff Writer

Four student groups will live in
internationally themed halls next
year, continuing a program devel-
oped by the Residence Life Office
(RLO) and Dean Rusk
International Studies Program, that
began this past fall.

East Asian, global water and
French language themed halls will
occupy the first floor and basement
of Duke Residence Hall while the
international women’s hall will be
located in the basement of Cannon.
Students will engage their theme
through an array of activities gen-
erated by the groups with the guid-
ance of a faculty adviser. A portion
of programming will seek to
inform and involve the campus
community.

With a total of 32 students
involved, next year’s themed hous-
ing program will feature expanded
participation compared with the
current year which saw 26 students
living on two different halls—the
Spanish language hall and the
political and economic develop-
ment hall.

After initiating inernationally
themed halls this past year, RLO
and Dean Rusk revamped the
process by which they select both
themes and participants for the
halls.

INSIDE, THIS WEEK |

Whereas last year’s application
process set predetermined themes
and asked individual students to
submit applications, this year,
groups of six or ten committed stu-
dents were solicited to develop
detailed proposals for themes and
potential programming.

“We established a more stringent
proposal process where a group of
applicants had to explicitly state
how they envisioned their theme
and what sorts of activities they
had planned,” said Associate Dean
of Residence Life and RLO
Director Patty Perillo.

“This past year we found that
there were students this past year
who chose to live on the halls that
were not necessarily were commit-
ted to the themes,” she said.

“By having students write their
own proposals we ensured that we
got students who were deeply com-
mitted on the front end.”

Fourteen groups submitted
applications by the Feb. 1 deadline.
Proposals that were not accepted
included themes such as “Cuisines
of the World,” “International
Trade,” and “International Refugee
Awareness.”

Applications were evaluated
largely on their congruence with
the mission of the Dean Rusk
Program.

Raising questions
about academic policy

By ALIssA CURRAN
Staff Writer

Cherishing tradition has always
been a hallmark of Davidson
College, one that gives way to its
unique charm. This year, the
Academic Policy Committee, a
subcommittee of the Student
Government Association, has
wrestled with how to improve the
Davidson curriculum while main-
taining the school’s quaint identity.
The committee’s findings are pro-
voking controversial and complex
issues across campus.

At the final Academic Policy
forum of the year last Wednesday,
students and faculty addressed
issues regarding the curriculum
and academic experience at
Davidson. They also discussed
how regional, technological, and
globalization trends will affect the
curriculum and the overall
Davidson experience.

Academic Policy Committee
members Meikaela Zwierynzski
*10 and Colby Uptegraft ’09 medi-
ated the discussion, having spent

the year examining data collected
from various study groups regard-
ing the academic experience at
Davidson from current students,
alumni and faculty.

President Tom Ross started the
meeting by acknowledging the col-
lege’s need for an updated curricu-
lum.

“We need to take a hard look at
where we are right now and identi-
fy our strengths, see where there’s
room for improvement, and capi-
talize on those strengths as we
move forward,” Ross said. “We’ve
looked at regional growth, demo-
graphic changes, and globalization;
all will have a significant impact
on Davidson and will lead to
changes in the liberal arts educa-
tion.”

This year, five committees par-
ticipated in a Strategic Assessment
of the college in an effort to high-
light the areas of greatest need in
response to external factors. This
semester, the college created seven
more study groups to analyze inter-
nal issues at the College. Ross said

WALT
goes off-
campus

By Cunt SMITH
Staff Writer

For the first time in the history of
the 29-year radio program,
WALT1610 will have  inernet
streaming. Listeners will have their
first opportunity to hear WALT off-
campus.

At www.walt1610.com, students
will have access to non-stop music
and special programs. In addition
to the endless buffet of music, peo-
ple will also now have access to all
their favorite shows on new pod-
casts.

“We have been playing around
with the idea of internet streaming
for several years now, but the pric-
ing of the technology had always
prevented it,” said WALT technical
director Owen Bussey °08. “But I

knew that if we did not do it this

year, we never would.”

Bussey then took it upon himself
to make sure that this dream
became a reality. He worked hand-
in-hand with ITS to solve the prob-
lems regarding pricing and band-
width and found someone off-cam-
pus who would be able to broad-
cast the signal worldwide.

In addition to getting past the
financial and technological obsta-
cles, Bussey and the rest of the
WALT executive board had to
prove to the administration that the
students were serious about the
update.

“We had to present the idea to
the school in a manner in which we
could prove that this would be a
successful long-term endeavor.
The school is very proud and won’t
approve just anything. We had to
show we were going to represent
Davidson College in a positive
way.” Bussey said.

WALT has had intranet stream-
ing for computers connected to the
campus networks for several years
which only allows students and
faculty to listen to the feed while
on campus.

Before 1978, students broadcast-
ed their own shows via the WDAV
-FM signal, which is an off-campus
affiliate of WALT.

The station has now grown from
being a weak 10-watt AM station
that could barely be heard off-cam-
pus, to a station that can reach any
audience anywhere in the world.

The new internet feed launched
the Monday after spring break.
This marks the first time since
1978 that anyone not on the
Davidson campus can listen to live
broadcasts of WALT’s radio station
instead of receiving a weak AM
