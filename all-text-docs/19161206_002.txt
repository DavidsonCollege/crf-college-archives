In this the last issue of Tite Davip-
SONIAN for the year 1916, the editors
wish for every student good aim, invul-
nerableness, and no hard luck, during
the coming seige of examinations, and
to each reader, every blessing and joy
that the approach of Christmas can
bring.

Yes, it has been a great football seas-
on, and whenever we think of the rec-
ord Davidson has made, we feel like
sticking our chests out and holding our
heads up.

And we are all anxious to get home,
too, to “horse” that fellow from Clem-
son, or Roanoke, or even Va. or Caro-
lina, that we played rings around. And
we want to nudge that Tech friend in
the ribs, and just remind him how ‘Tech
would have, but for hard luck, been tied
by a little Red and Black team.

It’s fine to belong to a college that has
gotten such a reputation for demonish
fighting, wonderful speed and team-
work, and yet clean as clean.
is not one of us but feels thankful to
every member of the Varsity, every
Scrub, every bew-legged, hump-should-
ered, nervy little roughneck that went
out for practice, and every alumni who
has helped. .

But to the one above all who has made
this record possible, who has worked
hardest and most unceasingly, and who
has put his best into it, we owe the
greatest gratitude. Long live Coach Fet-
zer at Davidson,

AN ADDRESS GIVEN
ON WOMAN SUFFRAGE

Speaking under the auspices of the
Mecklenburg Equal Suffrage League,
Miss Gertrude Martin gave a most able
address on universal suffrage at - the
Civic League room on Tuesday evening,
November 28th. Miss Martin is a na-
tive of Arkansas. She is a speaker who
appeals to the intellect rather than to
the emotion and the audience is at once
struck with the knowledge of the sub-
ject which she shows. After she had
finished her address she invited any one
who might desire, to ask questions relat-
ing to her subject, of which there were
quite a few.
