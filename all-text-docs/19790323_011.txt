John Gerdy fought many tough defenses in his Davidson career but
he still sparked. The jump shot, like this one, was unstoppable.

Soccer team returns with experience

Like many Davidson stu-
dents, the Davidson Soccer
Team spent much of its Spring
Break in Florida. Unlike many
Davidson students, however,
the Soccer Team did riot spend
all of its time on the beach, but
on the soccer field, where they
put on an admirable show.
Remaking eleven individuals
into a well coordinated team
proved difficult at first, due
largely to the lack of outdoors
practice since the season’s end.
However, according to team
member Doug Schuessler, this
unity had been attained by the
fourth game.

against K-Land of Miami.

Though K-Land scored the first
goal, Davidson, with the help of
strikers Doug , C.K.
Nichols and Charles Coffee,
triumphed with a final score of
3-1. In an exciting maneuver
Schuessler deflected the ball off
a defender for Davidson’s first
goal, and Nichols and Coffee

both had breakaways scoring

The second game was played
against Arveida Soccer Club,
and after several scoring oppor-
tunities for Davidson were
missed, the result was a 3-3 tie.
Nichols gave a fine showing,
scoring two goals; the first, a
10-yard effort from the center of
the penalty area, and the sec-
ond, a two-yard goal to com-
plete the scoring for Davidson.

Davidson played its third
game.against formidable James
Madison University (also tour-
ing in Miami), and, with some
tricky maneuvers and great
teamwork, succeeded in defeat-
ing Madison by a score of 2-1.
Schussler, assisted by a
“through pass” from Stan
Reed, scored the first goal. A
clever fake from Nichols en-
abled him to send the ball into
an open net to tally the winning

The fourth and final game
was a fine climax tgo the trip.
Davidson met one of Miami's
top amateur teams, the Miami
All-Select All-Stars, and lost by
a score of 3-1. At the half

Reflections on Davidson’s four-year star

By BILL

‘He is, perhaps, the best
shooter in college basketball
this year.”” That is how David-
son Head Basketball Coach
Eddie Biedenbach characterizes
John Gerdy, the Wildcat’s
stand out senior guard and the
school’s all-time leading scorer.
Biedenbach’s team was keyed
by Gerdy’s excellent outside
shooting and scoring through-
out this past season.

Biedenbach may be entirely
impartial, but Gerdy’s statis-
tics show that he was at least
the sixth best: scorer - his 26.7
points per game average ranked
sixth among NCAA Division I

’ players. He was also the South-

ern Conference’s leading scorer
and had the highest average in
the Southeast.

Gerdy has come a long way
from dribbling a basketball
along his paper route as a youth
in Little Falls, N.J.
blessed with outstanding phys-
ical talent, but he has also had
to work very hard to bring his
overall skill : up ‘to its present
level.

Although he was not heavily
recruited as a New Jersey
high school player, then-David-
son coach Robert ‘‘Bo”’ Brickels
knew that Gerdy was a’player
who could contribute much to
Davidson when he recruited
him. ‘‘I definitely felt he could
bring a new dimension to the
program,”’ Brickels said. ‘‘He’s
the type of player who can put it
in the hoop.”

Gerdy has certainly kept his
end of the bargain. Although he
has faced ‘‘stop-Gerdy”’ defens-
es since high school, his scoring
averages have improved every
year.

He has also been the player

‘that the Wildcats have looked

Miami had a strong comeback
to defeat Davidson by two
goals.

The Davidson soccer team
finished the Florida Games with
an impressive 2-l-] record, with
Nichols, not surprisingly, the
top scorer with four goals and
Schuessler, Coffee and Kremser
having three, one, and one goals
respectively.

Overall, individual per-
formance was high; Charles
Coffee and Jimmy Hawk, who,
though not regulars during the
season, gave strong per-
formances. The team. not only
gained valuable field experience
from this trip but also obtained

to in key situations. He has
been their leader. “I’m not a
real vocal person,’’ Gerdy said
of himself. ‘‘I try, to lead more
by being an example.”’

His shooting sparked Wildcat
scoring rallies needed to win
several games. His 22 second-
half points against Brown this
year led an exciting Davidson
come-back victory. His coolness
and court savvy have been vital
to the Wildcats all season long.

Perhaps more importantly,
his attitude and his play have
demonstrated a pride and a
determination to succeed which
often belied the team’s some-
times dismal record. Sports-
writers often quoted Gerdy as
saying that he would gladly
trade his individual scoring
nonors for a Southern Confer-
ence championship for the
Wildcats. Davidson has never
managed to win a Conference
tournament game _ during
Gerdy’s Davidson years.

It has been a frustrating four
years for Gerdy in many ways.
Besides their failure to win a
tournament game, Davidson
has not had a winning season
since Gerdy has been here.

While at Davidson, he has
seen the arrival of five different
head coaches. Brickels, Gary
Walters; Dave Pritchett, John
Kochan, and Biedenbach have
all held that position. ‘It has
definitely affected me,’’ Gerdy
said of the high ‘‘turnover
rate. It takes about a year for a
coach to figure you out, and you
to figure him out,”’ he added.

Gerdy was particularly af-
fected by the departure of
Brickels during his freshman
year. Brickels, who recruited
Gerdy, was fired following a
5-21 season. Gerdy seriously
considered transferring to an-
other school to play basketball
because he liked his former
coach and staff. He finally
decided not to leave, partly
because of the NCAA rule
requiring transferring ' players
to sit out one year of intercol-
legiate competition.

- It was indeed fortunate for
Davidson that Gerdy decided to
stay. His arching jumpshots
and his determined attitude
have always endeared him to
Wildcat rooters, and this year,
his standout play brought thou-
sands to their feet during every
game. Students’ sporting shirts
emblazoned with ‘‘Gerdy’s Gar-
rison’’ abounded’ on Davidson’s
campus this winter. And the
sustained ovation at game’s end
which honored Gerdy’s final
Johnston Gym appearance was
truly heartfelt. ‘‘It’s been a
rather disappointing four years,
but I really appreciate the
support the students and fans
have given me,’ Gerdy ac-

Gerdy fans may have a
chance to see more of him next
year if he plays professional
basketball. For Gerdy, that.
would be the culmination of
years of hard work and hope.
“Pro ball has been my goal all
my life,” he says.

player himself, definitely thinks
John’s talent will secure him a
shot at making the league. “I
feel he should be a high pro
draft pick,’’ Biedenbach says.

Some people feel Gerdy does
not have the quickness neces-
sary for a pro player, but
Brickels, who has seen him play’
since high school, disagrees.

“The word on him was that
he was a step slow,” Brickels
said. ‘‘The question is ‘a step
slow’ for what? He’s got an
awfully good first step, and it
has improved. He’s not slow to
get the shot off; he doesn’t have
a slow release.”

Gerdy made a icgeial effort
this year to dispel any criticism
of his speed. He stayed at
school during the summer and
worked on conditioning drills
with the football team. As a
result of this, he lost fifteen
pounds and got in good shape
for the winter.

Biedenbach noticed the im-
provement this year. ‘John’s
physical condition and stamina,
as a result of losing weight for
this past season, has made him
quicker and enabled:him to be a
more versatile player.”

Gerdy himself has answered
criticism of his quickness by his
efforts to improve. The result
has showed in his play. “‘I think
my main Question mark is my
quickness,’’. John acknowl-
edges. ‘‘That’s why I wasn’t
heavliy recruited in high school.
People have told me that I’m
too slow to play pro ball but
then they also told me that in

_ high school.””

Gerdy also worked on his
ballhandling skills this summer
and subsequently handled the
ball more this season. ‘‘When
teams pressed I’d try to help
out bringing the ball upcourt,”
he explained. He credits: his
improvement with raising his
assist total for this year. “I’m
able to handle the ball a lot
better and I’m more comfort-
able. I’m keeping my head up
and can see the whole floor.”

With his ’
touch and his improved ball-
handling, Gerdy might well be
playing professionally next

_ year. Pro scouts attended sev-

eral Davidson games this sea-
son. Brickels feels that many
teams can utilize his outside
shooting.

“If he plays for someone with
a good picking game or with a
running team, there’s no telling
what he can do. On either of
those two type of teams, he will
excel. He could hit 17 or 18 foot
shots all right,” Brickel said. —

Gerdy’s basketball future is
pretty much in his own hands
right now. It seems almost
certain that he will be reporting
to some NBA camp this sum-
mer. Once he’s there, he says,
“the most important thing is
Pepe ps sees
