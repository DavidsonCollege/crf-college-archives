Y. M. C. A. QUARTETTE
FORMED TO HELP MUSIC

The newly organized Y. M. C. A.

quartette made its first public appear-

ance on last Sunday night as a part of
the regular service. There wa$ a good
crowd out to hear Locke White and the
special music added much to the meet-
ing. The selection by the quartette was
“The Riches of Love,” which when well
rendered always forms an impressive
part of ariy service. As the four voices
blended in the final chorus, one could
have heard the proverbial pin drop in
eld Shearer Hall.

This quartette is exclusively a “Y” or-
ganization. They have offered them-
selves for service not only in the Sun-
cay night meetings but atso in Sunday
School work, special meetings and so-
cials. A series of books containing
selections for male quartettes has been
purchased, and the “Big Four” will con-
stantly increase and enrich their store
df pieces. The personnel is well chosen
and could hardly be improved, being as
follows: G. B. Sorrells, lead: O. J. Al-
lison, tenor and director; W. S. Buch-
anan, baritone; and W. E. Crane, bass.

D
MINISTERIAL BAND HEARS
REPORTS ON DEPUTATIONS

All who attended the Ministerial Band
meeting last Sunday will have to agree
that the program was an unusually in-
teresting one. This is evidently one of
the “livest wires” on the hill, and only
because everyone ts profoundly interest-
ed in the work, and inspired by the hope
of a happy future in the service of the
Master in winning the world for Christ.

Recently some members of the band
have gone to neighboring churches pre-
senting the appeal of the ministry to the
youth. Some of these are R. Bitzer, F.
L. Johnston, L. A. Taylor, D. H. Ogden,
and T. H. Patterson. Taylor and John-
ston, who went to Monroe and spoke
there on Sunday, also had the opportu-
nity to preclaim the great need in the
high school Monday morning in chapel,
and later to the senior class alone. They
feel that their trip was well worth while.
A mother of four small sons in Hunters-
ville came to Patterson after he spoke
and told him that she wished her boys
were old enough to realize the need so
plainly and clearly stated by him. She
had not before known how great the
need is. “This goes to prove,” said Pat-
terson, “there would be more recruits
fot the ministry if the cause were stated
more plainly to them; ministers preach
sermons in such a general way that peo-
ple do not take it home to themselves,
it is never personal with them.”

After similar reports from others the
meeting was closed . with prayer by
Baker.

DAVID LIVINGSTONE IS
SUBJECT OF VOLUNTEERS

The Volunteer Band met Sunday morn-
ing at ten o'clock in the “Y’,room in the
gymnasium. The topic for study was the
life of David Livingstone.

Before the first part of the program
began the regular monthly business
meeting was held. The several commit-
tees made reports on their work for the
past month and their plans for the
future.

After prayer Harold Moss read a
newspaper clipping which gave a brief
but forceful account of Livingstone’s life.

-Ed Cunningham, the leader of the meet-
ing, made a short talk showing the main
lessons we may learn from Livingstone’s
career, These were: That we should
usé the opportunities we have; that de-
termination can work wonders; and the
power of a life devoted entirely to

Christ-and one’s fellow men. The spirit
of Livingstone, he went on to show,
might be summed up as “That of utter
and entire devotion of everything in his |
life to the accomplishment of the task |
that God wanted him to accomplish.” |
Sentence prayers by the band follow- |
ed and then Moss explained the two!
posters which had been prepared for
this week. |
Next Sunday the band will meet in|
the “Y” room in the gym at 10 o'clock |
and will study the lives of S. N. Lapsley
and Alex. McKay. Books on these men
may be found in the library and the
members are urged to make a study -of
these men before coming to the meet-
ing. In this way they will be much more
interested in the discussion.

MISSIONARY GIFT GOAL
IS THOUSAND DOLLARS

One thousand dollars will be the goal
of the mission*drive this year, as it was
last. Where the money will go is not
quite decided.

The president of Hanchow Christian
College, in China, says that he wants to}

get some Davivdson spirit in that in-|
stitution; so he has written, asking that
a Davidson man be sent to teach there.
A committee is now at work, trying to
secure such a man. If it is successful,
the results of the drive will go toward
his support, instead of to Mr. Parker, of
Korea, as in former years, and Davidson
will support an alumnus in China,

The drive will start for either Mr.
Parker or the other Davidson man, as
soon as something ‘definite has been de-
cided,

MINISTERIAL BAND SENDS
FRASER AND GAMBLE OUT

Last Sunday T, L. Frater and W. Ar-
nett Gamble went on a Ministerial Band
deputation to Bethany, Tabor, and Har-
mony, three points near Statesville serv-
ed by Dr. J..A. Scott, father of three
Davidson alumni: Rev. Leigh R. Scott, 'o8
J. A. Scott, ’11, and Gordon P. Scott, ’10.

Fraser presented the need for full-
time Christian service, in the ministry
and the other branches of work, and
Gamble gave the call to service. At the
close of each service Gamble also spoke
on young people’s work. At the Har-
mony service Sunday night, several de-
nominations were represented and op-
pertunity was afforded to talk to Ep-
worth Leaguers and members of the
Baptist Young People’s Union, :

With three services and some thirty
miles-of travel by the John Henry route,
these fellows had a full day, but they
report a fine reception and a thoroughly
enjoyable trip.

“END OF THE WORLD” IS
A REAL MOVING PICTURE.
The “End of the World” came to Da-
vidson last Friday evening. Betty |

Compson was the star of the occasion. |

in “The Birth of a Nation,” had the part |
of the heroine's father. |

The play was directed by Penrhyn
Stanlaws, one of America’s” most noted
illustrators. More than a year
Vice-President Lasky, of the
Players-Lasky Corporation,
Stanlaws “placed in the Paramount
studios. It was hoped that Mr. Stan-
laws’ well known artistic ability might
be of service in adding the artistic touch
which many say is lacking in most
cinema productions. This necessitated |
a considerable study of motion picture |
technique. Mr. Stanlaws
several minor plays with success, but |
“The End of the World” is his first fea-
ture. The critics are divided in their
opinions, but Sherwood, of Life's staff,
holds that he has made a distinct suc-
cess of it. ‘

Next Friday evening at 7 o’clock W al-|
lace Reid will be shown in “The Love |
Special.”
