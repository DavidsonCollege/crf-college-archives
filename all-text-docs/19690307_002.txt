A Term Wasted

In his informal talk al Monday's
Open End, Joe Martin, assistant to
the dean at Duke University, ralsed
a paint wiick has sparked much dis.
cussion at almast every campus in the
country ~— the gap between the stu-
dent and the policy makers.

Martin spoke of the Duke Board of
Trustees. At the Univermtv ef Vir-

fia it's the state Board of Visitors.

abert Haas speaks of “the biggies.”
ly eadh case the gap is sdiinilar,

In commenting on the plight of the
Negro student at Duke, Martin sald
that the problam of understanding the
actions of the trustees is mot just a
Negro problem, bul one for all stu-
dents. He said quite frankly that when
Duke’s trastees meet this weekend.
whatever decisions they make or pol-
ictes they set, there will be a lack
of credibility among siudents a5 4
result.

The reason for such a lack of trust
or anderstanding on the part of the
students, he said. is simple. It is be-
cause the Board of Trustees meets
behind closed doors. It is because
‘the policy makers act on the advice
of ativisers whom students never hear,
on the motivation of information the

students never sev, Until the solution
of the problem is found, the gap will
continue, be ssid.

Vanderbilt University found what.
now appears te be the solution when
the trustees there ercated last month
a student position on the beard.
Chosen each year from the rising
Senior Class, that student will be able
to communicate more effectively
with trustees than ever before. And
perhaps @ mutual understanding will
evolve ott! of this spirtt of responsi-
bility and twoway interest.

Davidson has done wel! in the last
two years in the opening of communi-
cation tines between students and
trustees. ‘The opening discussions and
coffee hours have proved to be profit-
able and enlightening for both groups,
and the board has often expressed
its gratitude for the opportunity io
sound out student opinion anc idens.
Indeed, Davidson has been fortunate
in this respect.

But Jet us noi stop here. A student
position oo the Bourd of Trustees is
not at all unfeasible, and it cerlainly
would help strengthen the growing
credibility of students in regard to
the action tehind the closed doors.

Consistent Inconsistency

The assembly speaker is to talk
about black power, then explain it
in a question and answer period. And
who cuts assembly for a morning
coffee break? The chairman of the
Commission on Extra- Campus Respon-
sibilities.

This is Davidson.

“Life at Davidson is 50 planned Lal
it ig essentaliy democratic .. " says
the catalogue. Thus the Dean's Coun-
ail works in secret to deeree the rules
by which students will live, and the
student government railroads refer-
endums and packs the Senate.

This is Davidson

‘Theze wha play football well get w.
82,500 scholarship. Those who play
the trumpet well, or write well, or
serve in student government gat

This is Davidson.

Qae faculty member with a bache-
lor's degree is only an assistant pro-
fessor because he lacks a doctorate.
Another holds a full professorship
because the Pentagon appointed him.
He also has & bachelor's degree.

This is Davidson.

ranged to stir up student support for

tusually try to hide it. But it really is

sistencios teave one's Ife in college

Closing The Gap

The estve of the cat system at Da
Vidsen came into question again thfs
week in the vase of a freshman whose
recurring illnesses are ging to torce
him to overeut two classes... and
tus fail.

In this particular case, the fresh-
men has been foreed to miss over
two weeks of classes over the period
af the 10 week term. In ope course
he & having academic problems, bat
in the other two be is carrying 3
grade of “B.” Because of the quarter
cut system, he will probably fail all
thre.

Far while the present system allows
a-student to make up a Teview missed
becouse of illness, M makes no pro
vision for “axeused” absences. In
causes In which the student can man-
age to maintain his level of achieve-
ment in spite of forced absences, the

sysiem becomes an often tnjustified
punishment.

The plight of this freshman is nolL

att iggtaled case, and fer this reason
the ¢lass-vut system needs a thorough
re-evaluation. The ideal arrangement
would be an unlimited cut policy, but
then such a policy is hinged on stu-
dent maturity and responsibility —
something which zomeone in authority
hes decided is nonexisient at Davicd-
son,
So the alternative proposal, to be
utilieed until the aforesaid respopsi-
bility comes to the Davidson student,
would be one of “excused” absences,
at least for illness and college-spon-
sored events.

Such a set-up woulil not give str.
denis ‘something for nothing,” but
it would guarantee protection against
“nothing for something.”

Christianizing The Commitment

Fotherson, N.C. (AP} Fatherson College officials
announced bere today that despite student protesi.
Professor Enerasan Susej wil) not be asked to re-
main on the faculty at (iis small, Presbyterian college
for men.

“This i¢ o Christian college,” suid one source
cloge to the president, “Our Christian camusitinent, as
we call it. does nat allow us to have on our favulty a
man who does not profess to be a Christian. We have
2 tradition 10 uphold.”

It is just that tradition that stedeats protesting
the move contend is in need of re-examination. “What
are we educating people for here?” asked one student.
“This ‘priceless heritage’ we're supposed to possess—
does that inciade all the things that have gone with
‘Christianity' ur just the good things?”

How did this vollege educate men in the past?"
interrupted a second student, “What was it saying,
what were its graduates doing during ‘slavery?

“Were they the same zenophobes most of their
contemporaries were? What were they saying after
the socalled ‘redemption’ of the South by while
Southerners when all the Jim Crow baws wera passed
and lyneh law begsn io take its vengence?

“We know thal they were nice to their children
and didn't beat their wives, but If that's all the ‘Chris-
tian commitment’ of this collnge has done for its
gradtstes in the past we're nt sure jt’s something
we want to be obligated to.”

In a meeting with irate students tast week, an
sdministration spokesman was quoted as asking stu-
dents to “leave him out of this!” when the students
asked what he thought Jesus would have to say about
the dismissal,

“We're not tatking about such things,” repeated
the spokesman several times, sending 3 wave of mur-
muring ground the room, “We're concerned with
what our rules say we are. Furthermore. our rules
provide us with explicit guidelines on how to be a

hristian college. No, 1 haven't consulted the New
Testament but J know for a fact that not one of you
has even looked at the trustees’ 1859 regulation on
hiring only Christians as faculty members.”

Students claim to be somewhat confused, Upper-
classmen at the school were all required to take a
New Testament Bible course as freshmen. The course
has since been dropped as a requirement — the reason
being, many students feel, that the content of the
course was not in concert with what the trustecs en-
vislon as ‘Christians’.

Students say that stil more confusion arose from
the fact that students were first required to take the
course, then told that what they learned in it was
{rrelevent to the considerations of a Christian college.

Activism on the Fatherson campus has not yet
reached the intensity of violence experienced recently
at nearby Dook University, but administration offie-
jals are vigilantly watching for a rtsmored takeover
of the college chaptain's office.

Top officials have been tight-lipped about pos-
sible disciplinary action in the event of such an action
on the part of students. but a statement of polivy
Teleased by the administration last November azic
that “inmmediate suspension” from the college wonld
be “fully warranted” for any siudent “who disrupts
in any way the normal processes or activities of any
part of the college.”

Sources close te students alleged in bo plotting
the office takeover say that the plotiers are gather-
ing frequently in secret meetings trying to think af a
way to convince the trustees to adapt a hieher stan-
dard ttan the present one.

So far thoy have received no anawer from the
trustees.

__ One student, who asked not to be indentified,
said that he did not think students could be suspended
for interfering with the ‘normal processes" of the vol-
lege, since the so-called “in Joco Christus" rule could
certainly not be regarded as normal.

“If that’s ‘normal’,” concluded the student, “then
s0 was Roman persecution of the Christians."
