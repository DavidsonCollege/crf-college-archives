THANKSGIVING.

Dr. Richards’ encouraging and cheer-

ful message in his sermon last Sunday,

was indeed timely and helpful. When
the rain) clouds have lowered fur ten
days, and financial and business clouds
for a much longer time, it is easy for a
plague of “the blues” to spread. ‘Vhen
ao oman who resists the infection and
laughs though his pockets be empty, does
as much good as the sun breaking
through the mist after a gray week. We
are not riddled with bullets every time
we try to get some food, as thousands
of the Belgians are, and swe have a hap
py Christmas in store, a joy that few of
Europe's young nien will) know — this
winter.

Let us be thankful and carry back to
the homes that may be a bit discouraged
a glad, buovant spirit that will make our
holidays a blessing, a ‘Vhanksliving as
well as ‘Thanksgiving.

OUR FACULTY,

We wish to thank the Faculty for ex
tending our Christmas holidays to the
sth of January. It seems perhaps a lit-
tle thing to them, but it is a big thing
to the man who has been fast in’ the
traces for three months, and te whom
home is still everything in the world.

We have a Faculty unexcelled, we be-
live, in the State, in scholarship and _abil-
ity. It is unexcelled, too, in its consid-
eration of student interests and desires.
It lends its heartiest support to every
worthy college activity. Rightly then
does it demand a rigid scholastic stand-
ard.

The croaking critic who is continually
finding that things do not suit him, and
that he does not suit things, is apt to in-
clude the Faculty.

Let us stand behind our Faculty as
they stand behind us. and give them our
ardent aid in all their plans for the bet-
terment and upbuilding of Davidson.

A contemporary suggests that if the
European soldiers are in need of horses,
they might make use of some of the
ponies that browse in numerous number
on the book-shelves of the American col-
lege student.

A merry, merrier, and merriest
Christmas to all.

clear, however. In the first place. Dav-
idson is entirely clear in’ responsibility
for the decision. “The bali was put into

play, the Davidson team played it. and WANTED—To half-sole that pair

when Referee Sampcon declared thar the
umpire’s whistle could not stop the play.
welcomed the decision, but it would be
extremely unfair to say that Davidson

was partial to Davidson, when he was
going. by the rule-book: .
Secondly, it: seems to us thar if the
Wake Forest plavers intended to protest
he game and leave the field. they should
have done it before the voal was kicked
for Davidson by McKinnon. Tt was
nantly when the score stood 7-6 against
them that they refused to play on.
Lastly, an adverse decision of the um-
pire seems to us no valid excuse for quit-

rings a game, even tf the hove of victory

hack heen coddenly shattered. Base ball
eames would be stopped every dav in
the summer if a team quit every time the
vinpire decided against it, Ar the rate
the Davidson team was going in the last
auarter, there are many who firmly be-
lieve that Davidson would have retis-
tered another touchdawn, anyway. But
thie of course, we cannot say for certain.

We merely wish ro lav the above facts
before the readers of Tite Davinso~n-
