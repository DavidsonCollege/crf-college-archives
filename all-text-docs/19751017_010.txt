‘Off Agai

By KIRK COMBE
and TOM BLACKWOOD

In the important world of
IMAC ‘flickerball, those spur-
ting favorites ‘‘Off Again’’
came again and again to
victory over a mired Dungeon
Demons, 25-0.

After the game the Demons
could only wipe their brows
and say, ‘‘They just kept
coming and coming.’’ Etc.
also established a winning way
with an impressive 33-7 vic-
tory over first floor Richard-
son.

Cloud-nine referee George
‘‘close your eyes before you
bleed to death”’ Loy wrote this
in-depth comment on the
seorecard: ‘‘Rock Powers
scored three TD’s, one on a 70
yard run to lead rout over
inept Frosh.” You told us your
back was hurt, Rock.

Cannon 111 and KA #1 Emanon wiped the useless and

That second match-up wasa eating house did their thing
hard fought game between two and drained the stunned first
of the best teams around this a
fall. KA out-organized the
PDT team, but the PDT had
more fun.

But if you were out there to
have fun there wouldn’t be any
sidelines.

The later action of the week
had Etc. once more coming
out on top. This time they
crushed Cannon II 53-0.

Freshmen, you are an emb-
arrassment to your species -
and as soon as we discover
just exactly what that species
is we'll let you get red.

We have one girls’ score this
week: The ATO of the girls’
division, the Harlem Shuff-
lers, came down hard on the
girls of 3rd Watts, 12-0.

the program.

“One of the primary
goals of the program,”’
contiuued Dr. Jacobus, “‘is
to compliment the inter-
national aspects of the .
regular curriculum.’’

He pointed out that

_especially students taking

such courses as Internat-
ional Politics of South
Asia, Comparative Reli-
gions, the Religions of
South Asia, or South Asian
Studies could benefit from
the study of a non-Western
language.

This term two students
participated in the pro-
gram, and they will con-
tinue their studies next
term. Hopefull others will
continue their studies next
term. Hopefull others will
enroll. Interested students
should see Dr. Jacobus.

' uages as Japanese, Italian,

Norwegian and Russian.

“This program is a very
good way to expand the
linguistic possibilities at
Davidson,” concluded Jac-
obus.
