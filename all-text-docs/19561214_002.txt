Davidson's Grass Is Green, Too

Criticism. both merited and unde-
served, is heaped weekly upon the head
of Davidson as an institution and on in-
dividual shortcomings in general. As long
as this is done constructively and intelli-
gently, it has a place and is of service to
the college as a whole.

Perhaps it is the approaching Christ-
mas season, or a feeling that too much
has been said in a negative sense that
provokes this article. At any rate, there
is much to be thankful for here at David-
son, and we need to be reminded occa-
sionally of the positive advantages that
we are privileged to enjoy.

Most obvious to the eye is the beauty
of the campus and the modern, more-than-
adequate facilities which are provided
here. From Chambers, to the dorms; from
the Union to the gym; from the chapel to
the library, we have the best possible
physical. plant to serve us.

Though it is often hard to admit after
four reviews and a paper in a week, deep
down there is a sense of pride in the
knowledge that Davidson provides one of
the most solid academic programs in the

South. And an enlightened faculty not‘

afraid to render a service beyond the
classroom plays a great part in the chal-
lenge that a four year study program con-
stitutes.

Not the least important is the advant-
age of community life on a high level. The
majority of us will never again have
friends as close or of the same caliber that
we find here. Working with others in fra-
ternities. living in a dormitory with peo-
ple of different backgrounds and inte-
rests, learning to be tolerant and under-
Standing of other persons all make up
part of the great spectrum of our educa-
tion.

Socially, the access which the magic of

Securing A Family

Unexpected trouble has been encoun-
tered this week as attempts continued to
secure a Hungarian family for the David-
son community.

Reports from the refugee center at
Camp Kilmer, via Church World Service
which is handling the Davidson request,
states that young students and profes-
sional men outnumber ali other types of
refugees by 90 to 1.

The prevailing situation at Camp Kil-
mer is understandably hectic at present,
and the airlift currently underway will
doubtlessly intensify the situation. At-
tempts to settle these people in American
communities has slowed to a snail’s pace.

Despite this naturally confused situ-
ation, we cannot help but notice. the wide-
ly-publicized fact that hundreds of Hun-
garian families already have been and
are being placed by various agencies in
communities across the country.

In light of the preponderance of young
single men over family groups, it has
been suggested that a qualified student
or students be secured instead of a family
as originally decided.

On the other hand, we feel that it is
imperative that efforts be pushed to the
hilt to secure a family, even if there is
a waiting period involved. The whole pro-
ject was keyed from the start with a fami-
ly in mind.

Student giving has been with the un-
derstanding that it would be used to that
end. Several substantial gifts from
sources in surrounding towns have been
pinpointed for family aid.

Interest shown by the entire communi-
ty stems directly from the appeal of bring-
ing a family unit here to live in, and be
a part of, the community. If a student
were secured, the townspeople would
have no really direct contact as in the
case of the family, and the “community

the Davidson name gives to girls’ schools
or into the homes of the area. the dance
weekends, the frank and open play of
ideas on the campus about social matters
point to a well adjusted personality to
meet circumstances as they arise, here
and after we depart.

To the seniors the value of the name
is demonstrating itself as graduate
schools and business concerns place them
high on the list of prospective associates.

Religious growth is stimulated in some
areas and there is the opportunity to re-
evaluate one’s beliefs in line with the
central Christian doctrines of the ages.
Both personal growth and public service.
enhance our chances of realizing our-
selves as individuals who are more than
matter.

The chance to stimulate our interest
in long neglected cultural phases are giv-
en in the Artist Series and fine arts pro-
jects. This past weekend portrays graph-
ically the possibility of our heightening
our interests in certain fields of service
to such an extent that we will be active
and intelligent in politics, the Church, or
in civic service.

Admittedly the going gets rough at
times. Agreed, Davidson is far from
a perfect place. But in the mind our prob-
lems are inconsequential as compared to
those that will arise when we are provid-
ing for a family.

These are four full, beautiful years.
Let’s not let our petty grievances blind
us to this fact until it’s too late to take
complete advantage of it.

As we bow our heads at Christmas
and the words, “let us give thanks” come
out, our thanks should not ignore the
whole significance of the college years.

Vital To Gift Fund

propect” label would no longer be valid.

Failure to secure a family before
Christmas as was originally hoped for has
hurt the Gift Fund both on campus and
off. It is unfortunate after such a mam-
moth kick-off for the drive that interest
could not have been continued through
bringing a family here at once, while the
drive for funds was still in progress.

While this failure is understandable
in the light of prevailing conditions at
the embarkation point, it is of prime im-
portance that we continue to press inso-
far as is possible for early action.

The Davidson community and student
body want a Hungarian family to come
here to live. They have given money to
that end. It would be wrong to disappoint
them.

Wilson and Acorns
Safely Endowed

There were no Hungarians or Elea-
nors here this week, but it was a memor-
able one just the same.

‘We got those fourteen Woodrow Wil-
son Memorial Acorns safely in the ground.

While the site of planting has not
been revealed for security reasons, it
is reported to be an elegant spot ideal
for nurturing until the seedlings are
ready for transplanting.

Simultaneously with the announcement
of planting came word from a call meet-
ing of the Trustees that Belk Dormitory’s
front yard has been selected as future
home of the Woodrow Wilson Memorial
Forest.

There’s only one drawback.

Oak trees grow abominably slowly.

Dear Editor.

The snowballing idea to reduce
the language requirement for the
A.B. degree has received a chal-
lenge from Cari Cooper. However,
even in Mr. Cooper's letter the
proponents for immediate change
can take heart, for his case for
fair play to the few is grounded
on unfairness to the many, and its
full implications therefore seem
untenable.

As I interpret the case, it is
maintained on the basis of two

arguments: 1) change is needed, ~

but changing now would be un-
fair to an industrious group of
seniors and juniors; 2) a change
now would deny a minority its
deserved privilege.

Concerning the first it should
be considered whether an unfair
principle applied in an unfair situ-
ation transvaluates the action into
an area of justice. In other words,
do two wrongs make a right. It
would seem, contrary to the con-
clusion above, the second action
would ‘only reinforce the first.

The second argument is, in fact,
not valid. An immediate change
which would benefit both the two
upper classes and the succeeding
classes would not deny any privil-
ege to the minority; it would mere-
ly extend this. privilege to others
who have been other-wise recog-
nized as deserving of the privilege.

Finally, and this is the crux of
the matter, why should this dis-
crimination be made against the
present juniors and seniors for
the sake of five per cent of the

LETTERS TO EDITOR

student body. Under the proposal,
sophomores and freshmen “not
willing to make the ‘sacrifice’ ”
would gain a _perogative over
juniors and seniors in the same
situation. This action would ap-
pear to be no more a matter of
fair play than the first argument.

In view of this, I conclude that
all the students, united in a spirit

of altruism in which the few who
are disappointed support the many
who are justly deserving, should

get behind the proposal for imme-
diate change until it becomes
strong enough to be recognized
both by the Faculty and the Board
of Trustees.

Most of us have been nurtured
on the belief in Santa Claus.
Though at the tender age of five
or six we were rudely awakened to
the fact that his existence was
only mythical, we have nonethe-
less allowed this concept to per-
vade our thought, our ideas, our
ideals and our society.

We have long venerated the
characteristics of the kindly old,
bearded man in the great, fur-
trimmed red suit. Poems have
been composed about him, songs
written of him and his ruby-nos-
trilled beast of burden. Thousands
of men even pay him the supreme
compliment of duplicating his ap-
pearance in order to deceive naive

Physics Equipment
Bows to Shrubbery

Dear Editor,

I find it difficult to put into
words the feeling of pride that
swells within me as I walk across

campus and observe the rows of
bushes, shrubs and trees that are
truly gracing the Davidson scene.

I sincerely hope that within a
few years the Davidson campus
will be ranked among the top
three National Parks in the coun-
try.

Evidently, someone around here
disbelieves the old adage that
‘money doesn’t grow on trees.’

Now I am a physics major and
I realize that Davidson is a liberal
arts college and the physics de-
partment here cannot and should
not compare with those of State,
Ga. Tech, ete. . However, there is
still a large (and growing) num-
ber of men who are paying for

a degree in physics (plus a liberal
education) here at Davidson.

The Physics department here is
lacking, not in quality and quanti-
ty of the staff, but in ye olde
green folding matter—money.
There are two-bit radio repair shops
in Charlotte with better equipment
than we've got in the labs in
Chambers. The staff is not to
blame for this, since the purchase
of one decent piece of equipment
almost drains their pitifully small
budget.

I realize, of course, that the
effect of the trees, bushes, etc.,
on the parents of prospective
alumni is a device not to be over-
looked, but I do wish that some
of this, in my opinion, wasted
‘tree’ money be channeled into
the Physics department.

party or to elicit charity in the
otherwise unconcerned passers-by
at a collection kettle for some
worthy organization.

Commercial artists clamor for
some new way to include his
familiar bewhiskered countenance
into the Christmas ad for their
product. Christian churches even
have Christmas parties in which
he plays a major role.

Renowned editors write letters
in reply to little children in which
they assure them this mysterious
and intangible being really exists.
They point to the great virtues
which lie in the heart of every
man and claim that as long as these
exist Santa himself must exist.
This seems strange logic to my
mind.

1 will mot go so far as to say
that these Santa worshipers are
worshipping a Golden Calf. This
would certainly be presumptuous
of men in the cases where they
understandably worship him as a
spirit and not as a tangible being.

I would question though why
they teach him to their children
only to frustrate them later in their
life by allowing them to learn that
their parents have been purveyors
of half-truths. I would question
why they use him so often only as
4 means to gain good behavior
from their offspring for a couple
of months out of the year.

Most of all, I would question if
Santa Claus really exists spiritual-
ly or materially, if he only makes
his appearance two months out of
the year. Can anything so good
Stay hidden so long.

No, Virginie, Santa doesn’t exist;
he couldn't exist if men forget him
ten months of the year.
