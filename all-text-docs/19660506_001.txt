ASSISTANT DEAN OF STUDENTS TOMMY COVINGTON
Open End Presents Discussion Of Student-Administration
Relationship

Covington Discusses

Position Of

By AL VARNER
Davidsonian Feature Writer
Speaking at Open End Wednes-

day night, Assistant Dean of
Students Tom Covington discuss-
ed many facets of student-facul-
ty-administration relations. He
was particularly emphatic about
misconceptions students have
about administrators, teachers
and even other students.

He stated that criticism of
Davidson is entirely too preval-
ent and that false opinions about
every aspect of Davidson spread,
“not through a grape vine; it's
a kudzu vine. ’’Asked what can
be done about this, Covington
explained the need for individual
students to verify any opinions
they receive through ‘‘the stu-
dents party line’’ by talking
frankly to the people in question.
*‘Have you ever asked a teacher,
‘Are you really as bad a guy
as everybody says?’”’

On the positive side, Coving-
ton seemed confident in the pre-
sent student body at Davidson
and even more optimistic about
‘the next five or 10 years.” He
forsees — shades of Burns and
Mekas! — a new type of stu-
dent, “the academically orient-
ed student.”

This new individual will ac-
cept more responsibility in stu-

Students

dent government affairs and will
“Nft out the potential of the fra-
ternities just because he'll want
to, not to satisfy the faculty or
anybody else. Ideally, one (in-
tellectual) program unique to
every chapter would be good.”

Covington also cited the need
for student help in making school
policy. He-mentioned that ‘‘the
great gap between students and
administrators is between the
ideal and the practical applica-
tion of policy. The student is
concerned with how something
will affect "him next year while
the faculty is concerned with
how it will affect Davidson over
the next several years."

For this reason, a campus
government makes sense _be-
cause it would provide both
viewpoints before and during
policy making. ‘Often an in-
nocent faculty policy can look
very bad to students and the
faculty just hadn't seen it in
that light.’ This synthesis of
opinions provided by a campus
government would also serve
to widen the overall college pol-
icy. “‘Becauses policy is a very
hard thing to pin down, the best
thing to do is to set policy such
saudent conduct, on _ broad
as Student conduct, on broad
guidelines.”

Richards will be eligible for reelection
to the Board next year after being off the

board for a year.

Elected a member of the Board in 1957,
Lingle’s term will run until 1970, when he,
like Richards, will have to sit out a year be-
fore being eligible for reelection.

Lingle is also serving as na-
tional co-chairman of the com-
mittee seeking to raise David-
son's share of the $7.7 million
Ford Challenge Grant.

“One of the most important
problems facing the trustees in
the near future is maintaining
the unique Christian character of
the college, speculated Lingle.
“I think it can and should be
done.

**However, it cannot be done
in just the traditional way, by
preserving the status quo.”

He reflected his experience
with the Ford Foundation Fund
in saying, ‘‘I think the Trustees
have a primary responsibility for
fund raising. They should take
leadership by being the first to
contribute and the most gener-
ous.

“Let me say that I think the
trustees have responded very
well indeed to the present chal-
lenge grant.”

Student abolishment of their
drinking rule came under fire
by the new president. “I'm
sorry to see the students aban-
don responsibility for drinking on
campus. I think that Davidson
has a better attitude because
there has been very little drink-
ing.

“I think that students ought
to reconsider their action. I
think that it is quite possible
that the experience of living on
campus without the regulations
will cause the more thoughtful
students to restore the rule.”

After graduating from David-
son, Lingle joined Procter and
Gamble and became executive
vice president in charge of inter-
national operations.

Faculty Approval Seen
As Virtually Assured

Compulsory Vespers should be suspended for the

of Trustees decided at their spring meeting yesterday.

In their proposal the Trustees
took no final action, but rather
recommended to the faculty that
such a course of action be pur-
sued.

Faculty approval of the Trus-
tee measure is virtually assured.

In recommending the tem-

! porary suspension of Vespers.

the Board called on the faculty
to strive to develop viable al-
ternatives to required religious

exercises.

In a statement issued-after the
meeting. the Trustees said:
“The argument that freedom of
conscience of: the individual is
involved does not appear to us
as relevant in this instance. Stu-
dents who enroll at Davidson do
so with full knowledge as to the
religious stance and policy of
the college.” a

Trustees Loosen Rules
On Voting And Tenure

The Trustees yesterday com-
pleted revision of their new set
of bylaws, liberalizing the pro-
visions on faculty voting and re-
ligious commitment and apdat-
ing the policy on faculty tenure.

Acting ‘in response to faculty
urging. the 51 Trustees granted
voting privileges on policy mat-
ters to professors who have been
on the faculty for at least a year
or who have attained the rank of
full professor; lessened the ex-

tent of Christian commitment re-
quired of psychology and philos-
ophy professors: and officially
accepted the American Asso-
ciation of University Professors’
principle of tenure.

The changes are the last of
over 170 made since. the Trus-
tees began revising their by-laws
four years ago. Although many
of the changes involve simple
additions or deletions, at least
a dozen of them have been con-

Faculty Social Group
Rejects Rush Rules

The Faculty Committee on
Fraternities, Clubs, and Social
Life declined to approve the
rush regulations drawn up by
the Interfraternity. Council for
1966-67 in its Wedensday meet-
ing, and the IFC laid plans for
an _Interfraternity Judiciary
Board.

The particular rule in ques-
tion was IV (2) which stated that
freshmen. would not be allowed

to enter a fraternity house ex-

cept with the permission of the
office of the Dean of Students,
in consultation with the IFC.

Mike Booe, president of the
IFC, indicated that the faculty

committee made its objection on
grounds that the rule was ‘“‘too
restrictive.” He. suggested that
the IFC would have to follow
more closely the guideline estab-
lished by the Social Life Eval-
uation Committee report that
freshmen be allowed to visit at
the houses until 7:30 p.m. No
member of the faculty commit-
tee was avialable for comment.

While the IFC re-examines
its rush regualtions, member fra-
ternities will be voting on
whether or not to adopt a pro-
posed amendment to the consti-
tution which would establish an
Interfraternity Council Judicial
Board.

The board would replace the
fraternity liaison officer in the!
investigation and enforcement of
infractions of rules relating to,
fraternities. The proposed jur-
isdiction of the judicial board
would cover the IFC constitu-
tion. and bylaws, regulations and

sidered ‘‘major.”

The decision on faculty votung
climaxes months of controversy.
In their meeting last October,
the Trustees had _ unintention-
ally made. the policy more re-
strictive ,overlooking the facul-
ty’s traditional practice of giv-
ing the vote to every faculty
member, regardless of rank.

. With the second revision, psy-

chology and philosophy profes-
sors, formerly required to be
Presbyterian ministers or offi-
cers, are now included largely
under general faculty require-
ments, which demand member-
ship in a Christian church.

By officially adopting the
AAUP principle of tenure, the
Trustees have eliminated an in-
consistency in practice and ruled
and accepted a policy that has
been used for over 10 years.

26 Years

26 years. as president of the
Board of Trustees after having
tetired yesterday.

“Of course, the intellectual
achievement is much higher,”
he explained. ‘‘This is due both
to improvements in public edu-
cation and the increased number
of applicants, giving us a great-
er choice of students.”

But Richards, president of Co-
lumbia Seminary in Decatur,
Ga., also believes the Davidson
student has a different attitude
from the 1940's. ‘‘Today’'s stu-
dent is much more sophisticat-
ed,”” he said.

‘The student today is prone to
be more critical and inquiring.
It is the spirit of the age to
criticize existing institutions,”
he went on.

He pointed to the questioning
of bases for convictions or lack
of convictions.

‘But certain basic attitudes of
youth don't change,”’ he explain-
ed. “Youth is characterized by
an outward search for happi-
ness: it is a more carefree pe-
riod.”

“Youth is also generally hun-
gry for spiritual values, though
expressed in different ways in
different generations,” he assert-
ed. ‘‘And in spite of today's criti-
cal attitude, there is still an ele-
ment in idealism present.”

next two years, the Board

ment .continued, “the Trustees
recognize the complexity and
difficulty of the problems in-
volved, Ours js a common desire
to find the most effective way in
which to express the Christian
commitment of Davidson and to
promote the highest spiritual
welfare of its students.”

The Board's statement ex-
presses grave doubts as to the
wisdom of the move. ‘Required
attendance at religious services
has been a part of the program
of Davidson throughout its his-
tory and we believe that the re-
sults have been good," it said.

“I'm hopeful about the meas-
ures,’’ outgoing President J.
McDowell Richards told THE
DAVIDSONIAN. ‘But I was re-
luctant to take the step.”

Richards expressed the belief
that the required program would
be permanently: discontinued if
the new programs are success-
ful.

“There was no real difference
of opinion throughout the meet-
ing,’ he commented, ‘‘just dif-
terences on method.”

Another Prustee said that the
tone of the whole meeting was
toward cliange. “When some-
thing such as this becomes a
stumbling block, it's time to try
something different.

“Of course, you can’t just
throw something like this out.

You' have to have something in

The Board's action came as a
result of a two-year study by the
Faculty Religious Life Commit-
tee which was presented to the
faculty April 5. The faculty
tabled the proposal at that time
until their May meeting, then
scheduled for last Tuesday.

However, that meeting was
postponed to allow Trustee con-
sideration of the question. The
faculty will meet again Tuesday
to take action on the Trustees’
recommendation.
