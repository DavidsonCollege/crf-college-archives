By SHAW SMITH
The gentlemen of Davidson
are very much aware that the

young lady displaying the
proofs for the annual pictures |
is a perfect picture herself,
What they probably do not|
know is that her home is in|
Jonesboro, Ark.; that she
graduated from Ark, State

College in the same town, with
a record to be envied by any-
one; that she is employed now |
in Raleigh, but — best of all
—she is moving to Charlotte
early in November!

For the benefit of the few gen-
tlemen who do not’know her name,

it is “Sue” Hughes, one of the most |

Majoring in art and French, she
was the only girl to be accepted in
the engineering school of the col-

lege. She was a dance instructress,
directed plays, sang in the college
trio and the church choir, worked
on the college paper for four years,
and also on the Jonesboro Evening
Sun. And yet, with her many hon-
ors, she is extremely modest, to say
the least.

DR. HOOD ADDRESSED |
CIVITANS ON RELIGION |

On last Friday, Dr. Frazier Hood
Professor of Psychology addressed)
the, Charlotte Club at. its
weekly meeting in the Chamber of

Civitan

Commerce

Dr. Hood's address was on the
subject of “The Relation of Re
ligion to Personality.” In his dis-

cussion of this subject, Dr. Hood
brought out the basic principals of |
religion and of personality, a n d/
compared the two.

His definition of religion was,"a
certain attitude toward God and
toward others.” He brought- out

the point that. the definition is not

complete without regard to the at-
titude toward others.
