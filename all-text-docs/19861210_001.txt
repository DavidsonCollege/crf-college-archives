Davidson granted

extension in

Southern Conference

_..;, By EDWIN PAGE ~*~
On Dee.’ 5, the Southern Con-
ference executive board approved
a one year membership extension
for Davidson. The vote was 7-0
for the proposal with Appalachian
State and Western Carolina abs-
taining.

The extension allows the Cats

to compete for Southern Confer-
ence championships in all sports
except football and women’s bas-
‘ketball for another academic year.
According to J.B. Stroud,
Davidson’s faculty representative
on the executive board, the

said that a concensus was reached

at this meeting and that last Fri-

day’s action by the executive ©

board was a “rubber stamp” ap-
proving the earlier decision. °
The move is apparently a one

year only proposal. Stroud said .

“We will request no further exten-
sion of Southern Conference
membership unless the institution
is prepared to commit itself to full

compliance of all conference re-

quirements.” This would mean re-
instating the women’s basketball
team and playing full time in the

Fire alarm policy being negotiated

By JIM DILLON
Negotiations: are currently
going on between campus police,
the Davidson Fire Department and
the college regarding the fire
alarm policy, according to Dean
of Students Will Terry.

In mid-October, the Davidson -

Fire Department asked to be
called whenever a fire alarm went

off. Since the fire department has’

taken over the operation of turnin

off alarms, the department must.

come to the campus, make sure
there'is no fire and evacuate the
building before an alarm can be
turned off. Davidson police have

no authority to. declare a false

alarm and cannot turn alarms off
until the fire department gives its
okay.

Before this plan took effect,
Davidson police were able to de-
clare a false alarm and turn the
alarms off. Evacuations were not
necessary in the case of false

alarms.

Housing Director Tom Jen-
nings says the system-is likely to
change again. Campus police will
once again have the authority to
turn the alarms off in the event of a
false alarm, but Davidson must be

_responsible for the evacuation of

students from dormitories.

“My guess is that we’re going
to change again,” Jennings said.
“We're going to try to do the
evacuations by getting hall coun-

selors, resident assistants and the,
police to knock on doors.when an:
alarm goes off. We’re not going to
ask them to risk their lives in the
event of a fire, but if the police are
going to be able to turn the alarms
off again, we have to take eaepHD-
siblity for evacuations.”

Jennings said it is possible that
fines will be charged to students
‘who do not leave their dormitories
when a fire alarm sounds. He said

tremely - -ualikely at the wrevent
time.

Plans for the extension began
in September when the executive
board denied Davidson’s appeal
for a waiver of the requirements to
play football and women’s basket-
ball. That denial left Davidson
less than a year to come up with a
new ‘conference to affiliate with.
The extension allows the Cats .
another year to search without .
having to face the prospect of be-
coming independent. }

Currently Davidson is actively
pursuing the possibility of affiliat-

‘ing with the Colonial Athletic As-

sociation. The CAA ‘is a basket-
acnairoe eee that does. ‘not

Kit Mortis said of the CAA, “It’s
the enly conference we’ve had
conversations with. Other confer-
ences have pursued us, but my
own inclination, is that the Colo-
nial Athletic Association is the
one that makes the most sense for
us. I think we’re a good fit. We’ ve
been affiliated with three of those
schools in the past and /we're
stronger in the areas we need to be

strong in han: a ve been i in the

past ten years.”

Although the CAA bas as
licly stated that it is not interested
in expanding at this time, Morris
remains optimistic about Davdi- —
son’s chances.

a decision regarding punishment ©
for those students will be reached
between he and Terry.

Belk Dormitory has caused
the most problems recently, ac-
cording. to Jennings. .During one
three-week period this year,
alarms went off 18 times and —
sounded for as long as 45 minutes
before being turned off by the fire
department.) °
