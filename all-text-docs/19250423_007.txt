when one’s interest flags thru familiarity,
China still becomes more absorbing. One

finds that it is exhausting when you try
to change their way of doing things.
China is much worse than a fraternity
meeting when it comes to convineing
other people to do things your way. I
is more like butting one’s head against
a stone wall: physicists tell us that the
wall moves, but we don’t believe it. Try
moving China.

At last IT have succeeded in getting
about fifteen boys to come out and learn
American Football. The way I got that
many to come out was to promise them
that I wouldn’t hurt them! Talking of
jobs: you just try teaching football to
fifteen boys who really don't care any-
thing about learning the game; are mor-
tally afraid of getting hurt; can’t under-
stand English; and have never seen an
“olive” ball before. You'll have quite a
job. We have no uniforms at all, and

hall in which there really were five hun-

the dust of ages on them. We asked the
priest how often they gave them a bath,
and he said that they washed them off
about one a year. We had a lot of fun
askingthe priest the names of the dif-

i but I'm really afraid that in most cases
he made up the name on the spur of the
moment. One interesting idol in this
hall the of Marco Polo, the
Italian explorer, who came to Hangchow
many long years ago. He looks just like
any one of the other idols, and not at
all like a “foreign devil.”

As I said, no one can interpret China
for you. The best way to interpret it is
to see it yourself; and even then you
oftentimes are not quite sure of what
you think about it. There’s only one

thing certain: it’s not like what you
think it is—you can be sure of that. Why |
not come over and visit us?
