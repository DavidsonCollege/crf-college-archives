Dr. Fulton

Speaks To

Students On Missions

Stresses Increased
Importance of Future
Foreign Mission Activity

Dr. C. Darby Fulton spoke to
the student body last Sunday eve-
ning at the vespers hour. He
brought a message concering the
increased importance of foreign
mission work during the present
world crisis.

Dr. Fulton, the Executive Sec-
retary of Foreign Missions in the
Presbyterian Church of the United
States, told of the necessity of an
acceleration of the missionary ac-
tivity in all the fields which. still
remain open. The text upon which
his sermon was based was taken
from the first chapter of Acts in
which the charge was given to
the disciples to go out as witnesses
of Christ unto all the parts of the
earth,

World Turmoil

The condition of turmoil in which
the world is found today was
discussed. Will Christianity be
over come by the forces of de-
struction, or will God find some
miraculous way in which to nfani-
fest his power?

This knowledge is denied to men;
they must continue prayer and must
‘persevere in the work for Jesus
no matter what—turn—the affairs
of the world may take. ~Men are
not to know the time nor the-placé
in which God will make his holy
will prevail. Men must be content
to strive always to do the work of
Christ, and they must be ready for
any fate.

Dr. Fulton referred to the life
of hardship disciples
forced to live in order to further
the word of God.

which the

Prayer

An appeal was made that Chris-
tians today should resort to prayer
for he accomplishmen of the great
task that the mission fields pre-
sent. Modern man laughs at prayer
as impractical, and he depends up-
on plans, money and other devices
of men. Men have utilized every
power in the universe except the
power which will overcome all ob-
stacles, the power of prayer.

The disciples used prayer as their
chief weapon, but we emphasize
everything in our mission work ex-
cept God. God was the helping
hand and the steadying influence
which guided the great mission
workers of the past, such as Living-
ston, and others, in their efforts.
don’t men look toward this ever-
present help today when the work
of Christ is suffering diffculties in
the warring nations of the earth.

Hardships

Difficulties will have to be over-
come if—any~-worthy—task-—-is—ac-
complished, but the field is too
large to be closed because certain
nations are engulfed in war. New
doors are opened and new workers
are ‘needed.

<hr. Fulton related a number of
stories which illustrate the suffer-
ing which the workers are sub-
jected to in the foreign mission
fields. If these men are willing
to undergo these hardships to ad-
vance the work of Christ Surely
we can help with the liberal of-
fering of our goods and the inces-
sant supplication through our pray-
ers,
