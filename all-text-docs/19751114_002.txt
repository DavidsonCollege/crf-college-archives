EY kg Spencer stalls negotiations

about new wildcat emblem

By MATTHEW COVINGTON
Executive Editor

Negotiations are being con-
sidered to commission wildlife
artist Ralph McDonald to
create a wildcat emblem which
would represent Davidson Col-
lege and become the school’s
symbol.

These negotiations are at a
standstill now because of what
college President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. calls ‘‘the chance
that we might be putting the
college in an unethical posi-
tion.”

The idea to get one symbol
for the entire school began
with the Alumni Office last
spring when then Alumni Dir-
ector Howard Arbuckle was

investigating the chances of
buying the rights to the
University of Kentucky wild-
cat symbol. The Alumni Office
wanted a wildcat for various
publications.

Obtaining rights to the Ken-
tucky wildcat was seen as too
expensive. The rights would
have cost the college $3500. It
was at this point that Assis-
tant Director Thomas Couch
suggested that an artist be
found to create a wildcat.

“It had gotten to the place
that every Tom, Dick, and
Harry had come up with his
own wildcat. The Athletic
Department, the Alumni Of-
fice, everybody had his own
wildcat. The bookstore even
got its way...a couple of

Senate votes to retain ‘incomplete’

By STEVEN BELL
Staff Writer

The SGA Senate Tuesday
called on the facul*_' Edu-
cational Policy Committee
(EPC) to retain the basic pro-
cedure for completing ‘‘In-
complete”’ grades.

Bob Husbands, one of the
student representatives on the
faculty’s Educational Policy
Committe, reported that
Registrar Richard C. Burts
has requested that deadlines
for finishing the incomplete
work of one semester be
established in the term im-
mediately following.

As it stands now, an “‘In-
complete’’ received in any
term need not. be resolved until
the end of the following
summer.

According to Husbands,
Burts has complained that
almost all of the ‘‘Incomp-
letes’’ are put off until the
summer deadline, creating a
“bureaucratic nightmare.”’

Burts has claimed that of
the 10-12,000 grades given
each year, 1000-1500 are ‘‘In-
complete” at first: too many
for the Registrar’s office to
cope with during those last
two weeks before the begin-
ning of the next school year.

However, many senators
took issue with the proposals
of the EPC that deadlines for
finishing incomplete. work be
established in the middle of '
the following term to relieve
the summer burden.

Senator Bo Baskin argued
that ‘‘the August 20 deadline
is very flexible for students
and faculty. This flexibility
should be maintained.” ‘

Baskin moved that the
summer deadline be abbre-
viated “only by the amount of
time Burts needs to process
the grades.’’ Baskin’s motion
passed 19-0, with one absten-
tion.

night, the Senate discussed
the part of the proposed
College Constitution that
permits the president of the
college to order an emergency
suspension of any student
activity at this own discretion.

The trustees want the power
to review any such action of
the president. In a motion
proposed by SGA President
John Munce, the Senate pro-
posed that such a review be
conducted within 14 days of
the suspension.

Said Munce, “I don’t know
if this is controversial or not a
this point. It seems to me that
it allays the fears of the

trustees that they might not
be able to act in time.

“T would argue that a Board
of Trustees that can’t decide
an issue in 14 days needs to
reconsider its whole way of
doing business.”

In still more business, the

. SGA amended the Residence

Hall Council By-Laws to omit
the references to (and thus,
the existence of) RHC class
representatives. Also, the
Senate approved a charter for
the Biology Club.

Absent from the meeting
were senators DiCenzo, Kunk-
leman, McMillan (2), and
Weber (2).

Sadler wins election

Davidson Mayor Tom S.
Sadler was unopposed for a
fourth term in town elections
held November 4. Town resi-
dents awarded him 274 votes
of confidence in his bid.

For the Office of Town
Commissioner, the race was
interesting in light of the
Commissioner’s recent deci-
sion to sell the town’s elect-
rical system to Duke Power.

mickey mouse wildcats.” said
Couch.

‘‘T wanted a wildcat that
would be good looking, not
vicious looking, but would
look like a wildcat, not some
cartoon.’’ continued Couch.

McDonald has submitted to
the college a pencil drawing of
a wildcat. If the basic design
was fairly good, McDonald
was willing to produce a water
color entitled ‘‘The Davidson
Wildcat’’ which the college
would buy. Prints of this
water color would then be
made. These too would be
purchased by the college and
sold to parents, students and
friends.

The contract which is now
drawn up and sitting in
Couch’s office calls for the
college to buy 1250 prints of
the original. The college would
then have the option to use the
wildcat in any way it wanted.

The wildcat design was

displayed during Parents
weekend to students and par-

ents. The response was posi-
tive, according to Couch.

‘‘We’ve got a contract to
sign. There seem to be some
legal remifications as to whe-
ther it is a print or a litho-
graph that we would be buy-
ing.

“Lithograph, print, I don’t
care what it is, I just want a
damn wildcat. That’s the only
thing that’s got me cranked
up,” said Couch.

The “legal ramifications”’
Couch mentions have to do
with the concern Spencer feels
that the college would not be
able to sell photographic
prints of an original watercolor
with a good conscience.

“T have put a quietus on the
project for now,” said Spen-
cer. ‘“‘The only way we could
sell originals of the wildcat
design would be if they were
stone lithographs. Apparently
what we would have to sell
under the current arrangement
would be prints.

“T don’t think this is what
we want and I don’t think
people would want to buy
them. I don’t want to put the
college in an unethical posi-
tion. It wouldn’t be fair to sell
prints of an original.

“Tf that’s what we would
have to do, we're not going to
do it,” continued Spencer.
