Bill Brannon, the official who
administered the census,
termed the results “a disap-
pointment.’’ But he quickly
‘added that the new census
figures will result in about
$1,000 extra for the town during
the next fiscal year. Brannon
pronounced the census ‘“‘defini-

Talking Heads offers diverse style

By JIM VITHA
Staff Correspondent

People who enjoy contem-
porary music in the style of
Roxy Music, The Cars, David
Bowie or Blondie ought to listen
to the Talking Heads’ most
‘recent album, More Songs
. About Buildings and Food.

The Talking Heads’ music is
new, innovative and definitely
played in a style requiring one’ 's
‘utmost attention. This album
has received much critical:
acclaim and one can see why it
has. Rock critics love new and
. different music and the Talking
Heads fitthemold. —

The front and back covers-of -
the album require as much
attention as the music itself.
The photo compositions are

lar to the: form of the music
itself.

The most stylistic and inno-
vative of the group is the lead
‘singer and guitar player David
. Byrne. Byrne plays with vocal
techniques just as Andy Warhol
plays with artistic images. He is
a cross between David Bowie,
Bryan Ferry of Roxy Music and
a fifteen-year-old boy.

ques. The keyboard work of
Jerry Harrison ranges from a
piano, to organs and synthesi-
zers, all dealt. with from an
eclectic point of view.

' The weakest member of the
group is the bass player, Tina
Weymouth. While the idea of a
_ female bass player is fine,
_ Weymouth really does not carry
her load of the rhythm work. As
it stands now, the, Talking

. Heads’ sound is treble oriented

-with the.drums and synthesizer

—

The person who most likely
influences this album, outside
of members of the group, is the
producer, Brian Eno. In addi- .
tion to producing, Eno sings
and works with a synthesizer, a
guitar, and percussion as well.
As one can tell, he plays a part
in much of what happens on this

_album.

Eno is considered one of the
foremost leaders in avant garde

‘rock music today. He experi-

ments with everything from the
energy of punk rock to the
strange images of David Bowie
and Iggy Pop. His influence
undoubtedly accounts for much
of. the Talking Heads’ diverse
style.

The Talking Heads are nei-
ther punk rock in the mold ot
the Ramones, progressive rock
in the mold of Pink Floyd, nor
the style.of rock and roll
followed by Nick Lowe and
Dave Edmunds.

Two of the more interesting
songs on the album are ‘The
Girls Want to be With the
Girls” and ‘“‘The Big Country.”
Byrne’s vocals are superb on
the former, screeching and how-
ling in an intense manner. On
the latter, the song takes the
listener on a tour of the United
States, from the cities to- the
farmland and to the shoreline. .

However the most fascina-
ting song on the album is a
remake of an old Al Green song
“Take Me to the River.” It is a
very powerful song with good
lyrics, interesting rhythm tech-
niques and forceful chordal
work. :

If a listener is unable to enjoy
futuristic and different mu-
sic, stay away from the Talking
Heads. However, for an inter-e
ested listener, the Talking
Heads’ More Songs About
Buildings and Food, could be

Lindsay, who visited about
130 houses to take the census,
said people ‘were ‘‘generally

just kept calling his neighbors

Lindsay’s only problem were

six enumerators were N.C. Fel-
