“BIKO”

By KURT BIEDENKOFF

This morning in chapel the
court of Control once again made
several freshmen stand up and
show themselves to the enraged
upper classmen. A court, may it be
one like this or
may it be one of
a Student yovern-
ment, at least
shows that there
are student activi-
ties, And student
activities in
school may: be} j
considered to bet 7 \
important parts... Lb ;
of the educational program.

The lack of these activities, at
least ufi to now, is one of the main
disadvantages of the German school
system.

During the time of the Nazi re-
gime, ‘German schools (especially
high schools) were completely con-
trolled by the government and
strongly influenced by the ideas of
Nazism. It was the idea of the
Nazi leaders to train the youth
for their places and thus secure
the future of their regime. :

When the war was over in ‘JF
and the Allics took over the Ger.
man government and territory. a
tremendous chaos was left. And
most of 4.1 the German youth was
damaged, not materially but psy
chologicallv.

Men who had been heroes, were
now criminals. Things which had
been pood were now crimes.

Jn this very situation, which was
as difficult as it could be, the occu-
pying nations had to begin to in-
troduce new ideas and new methods
of teaching. Old books had to. be
destroyed for they could not: be
used any longer. Many teacher
had to be dismissed member:
of the Nazi party; a great percent
age of school buildings were de-
stroyed or partly damaged.

Slowly everything began to work
again. But soon it could be seen
that complete new ways had to be
found in order to help the German

Military Fraternity
Hears Col. Ballard

Wednesday night, Septémber 28,
Scabbard and Rlade held its, first
mecting of the new year. A thor
ough reorganization was effected
at that time. The officers for the
following year are Sandy Carne-
gie, president; “Smiley” Childers,
vice-president, Bill Cleveland, sec-
retary; and Jimmy Glenn, treasur-
er. The following activities were
‘agreed upon as a means of getting
the fraternity on its feet: Guest
speakers will be sponsored; com-
bat films will) be shown for the
benefit of the student body; band
concerts will be given in chapel.

The society was honored with a
speech by Lt. Col. Ballard of the
ROTC Dept. at the October 5
meeting on the controversial sub-
ject of Air Force vs. Navy Air
Power, After a very interesting talk
and discussion among the mem-
bers and Col. Ballard, the meeting
was adjourned.

Scabbard and Blade was estab-
lished at Davidson in 1923 and is
a@ chapter of the National Society
of Scabbard and Blade. Before the

War, the annual Military Ball was
the biggest dance on the campus
and there is hope of again placing
it in that position. There, have been
two dances sponsored by this group
since 1946.

The aim of Scabbard and Blade
is to recognize outstanding military
leadership and to keep its member-
ship informed of current military
affairs in order to make them a
better informed citizenry.

Scabbard and Blade would like

New Members Swell
Davidsonian Ranks

The Davidsonian is very pleased
to announce the newly acquired ad-
dition of a large number of fresh-
men and sophomore, editorial and
business staif members. A greater
number of students have expressed
interest in and a desire to write for
The Davidsonian this’ year than
ever before in the paper's history.
The editors and business managers
of The Davidsonian would like to
extend their sineere appreciation
to each of these men, and to state
again their conviction that each
new writer — whether he be con-
cerned with news, features, or
sports — and business staff mem-
ber hns set himself to a task which,
if followed through to completion,
will vield him the rich rewards of
a deep sense of ‘satisfaction and
jO¥, opportunity to make many
valuable new contacts, and form
many new | friendships.

The, Davidsonian regrets the fact] |
that due to® the unusually large
humber of men who have recently
joined the Editorial and Business}
staifs. it will be impossible to in-
clude every man’s name in the
masthead. Up until this tine every
member of both staffs was includ.
ed.. However, since. there ‘are at
present over one hundred and fifty
members on the two stafis, only
