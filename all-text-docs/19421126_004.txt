Mr. Carter said that he felt truly
at home on the hill as he has been
well acquainted with Mr. Berg of
the college faculty for a number of
years. He also knew Mr. Pfohl quite
well at the University of Michigan
where they both studied.

Mr. Montgomery, the very offi-
cious police officer, of Carmen, an
alumnus of Princeton, felt quite at
home in what he wanted to term
“Southern Princeton”. While in col-
lege Mr. Montgomery ran the mile
on his Alma Mater’s track team. His
time (4:16) was such that he earned
a position on the United States
Olympic team, but because of a
pulled tendon was unable to sail
with the team. He expressed .inter-
est in college athletics and wished
for Davidson a very successful track
season in the coming spring.
