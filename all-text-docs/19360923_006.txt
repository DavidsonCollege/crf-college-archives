Have You Matriculated Yet,
At Charlotte?

ELL, it’s something every Davidson man does

Senior or Frosh, extrovert or introvert, blonde er
dark, tall or short. He establishes—or re-establishes—™
his at-homeness at HOTEL CHARLOTTE and _ its
“Tavern,” every year; it’s an old Davidson custom.

\nd why not, pray? Where’s a better place to meet
your date than in our Lobby? And where’s a better
place for a college man—maybe a temporarily-hard-up
college man, to eat and foregather with his peers? And
where’s a place that welcomes you more heartily, likes
more to have you around?

If you haven’t been in this year we can-tell you
how we feel about it in one word: HURRY!
