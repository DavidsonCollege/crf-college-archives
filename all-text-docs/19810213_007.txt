February 13, 1981—The Davidsonian—7

Wildcats avenge loss to East Tennessee; defeated by UTC

It was the best of times; it was the
worst of times for the Davidson basket-
ball team this week. As the team won
an 84-82 overtime thriller from East
Tennessee, it seemed nothing could go
wrong. As the team lost 99-85 at the
hands of Tennessee-Chattanooga, it
seemed as if nothing could go right.

Eddie Biedenbach played all his cards
right against East Tennessee. He sub-
bed in little-used players Tom Franz and
John Corso at the most opportune
moments, and each came up with key
plays. From his point-guard position,
Franz crashed. the boards to go up
against the Buccaneer big men and come
down with some key rebounds. Bieden-
bach sent Corso into the melee with a few
minutes of the first half remaining, and
the junior transfer made a key power
move to the hoop in the style of his
vanguard, Richie DiBenedetto, for tow
points. How much more of a team effort
can a coach expect? |

The substitution of the two players in
such an important game was suspect at
first, but Biedenbach had no doubts.
‘‘Fom Franz is one of the smartest
basketball players you'll see play the
game. He understands it. He knows
what’s going on. He’s one of the
soundest players in the game.’’ Bieden-
bach said. ‘“‘He’s not a bullet ball-hand-
ler, but he’s able to handle it. Franz was
the man for the job at that time.”’
“John Corso is from the same mold. He’s

a smart player. If it’s a tight situation,
he’s good to have in the game.’’
But Corso and Franz weren’t the only
Wildcats with stellar performances last
Wednesday. Todd Haynes filled the
hoop for a game-high 29 points to
overwhelmingly prove that he is out of
his mid-season slump and back into the
groove he has enjoyed for most of the
season. John Gullickson just plain filled
the hoop, going eight for eight until he
missed what could have been the game-
winning shot
That last attempt to put the game
away sparked plenty of controversy,
though. Davidson had come from behind
to take a halftime lead of five points,
but the Bucs stormed out of the locker
room to slice points off that lead. With
four minutes left they led the Wildcats
by four. Good defense and sharp
shooting tied the game up at 80-80 and
with a little more than a minute left in
the game the Wildcats went to a four
corners stall. Surprisingly, the Bucs
applied no pressure. With thirteen ticks
left on the clock, Haynes signaled for a
time out. That set up Gullickson’s shot,
and when the time came he drove down
the right forecourt for a baseline jumper.
Gullickson was crashed by two Bucs and
naturally missed the shot.

When play resumed, steals by Jamie
Hall and Haynes prevented even a
last-gasp Buc shot, and the game went
to a five-minute overtime period.

The Davidson Women’s bas-
ketball team improved its con-
ference standing in North Caro-
lina Division III by winning
two of their last three games.
The wins over Meredith and
Methodist were mentally im-
portant to prepare for the State
Tournament held in two weeks.
The Cats now stand at 3-14 for
the season.

The Cats won their first game
of last weekend’s trip 50-47
against Meredith. Jeanne Wo-
mack and Carol Heppner pulled
down 16 rebounds apiece. The
high scorer was Womack with
16 points followed by Kirby
Owen with 15. The game was
close right to the end even
though the Cats had several
chances to pull ahead with free
throws. The defense was tough
in the final minutes, by allowing
the Cats to hold on to their lead.

The second game of the trip
was disappointing as the Cats
fell to North Carolina Wesleyan
96-44. Harriet Holshuysen
came off the bench to spur the
team on with tough inside
shooting. She was high scorer
with 13 points, followed by

Womack with 11. The Cats were

troubled with fouls and turn-
overs at the end of the game.
Three starters— Womack, Mike
Frankhouser, and Mitzi Short
—fouled out with three minutes
on the clock. N.C. Wesleyan
shot 53% from the floor which
accounted for its high score.
The Cats defeated the Metho-
dist Lady Monarchs 57-56 with
one second remaining in an
exciting game Tuesday night ia

jumped to a 12 point lead in the
first 8 minutes of play. The
Monarchs fought back by cap-
italizing on Davidson mistakes.
Strong inside play by Method-
ist tied the game at 24 with just
over three minutes left in the
first half. With the momentum
on their side, Methodist made
two more baskets to lead 28-25
at the half.

The second half was a battle
of rebounds and nerves. The
Monarchs went 6 points ahead
but quick baskets by the Cats
brought them back to within 2.
Davidson tied up the score in
the last eight minutes of play
but was unable to push in to the
lead.

With less than a minute left,
and the Monarchs in possession
Captain Kirby Owen fouled a
Methodist player to stop the
clock. Luck was on Davidson’s
side as both shots fell off the
rim. The Cats called a quick
time out with seven seconds
remaining.

court ready to give it a try. The

spread and the Buc defense was applying
little pressure. After a time out with the
clock showing 0:12, the Wildcats put
their play in motion. Hall took a pass at
the top of the key with eight seconds
left, and he drove toward the basket,
knocking down a Buc player in the
process of putting up a shot that missed.
The ball went below the basket to
Haynes, who scored with one second
left.

The win couldn’t have come at a better
time. The team was coming off of two
tough road losses, and had suffered
defeats in three of the last four contests.
A loss would have dropped the team
from its league-leading position as well.

Then came a showdown between
conference number one and conference
number two, and the UT-Chattanooga

games continued.

“We took a poor shot selection early,
and that took away from our game plan.
We had too many turnovers and too
many missed assignments to stay in
contention with a hot-shooting home
team,’’ Biedenbach commented. UT-
Chattanooga shot 60.9% from the field.

That statement pretty much summed
up the Wildcats’ problems in a nutshell.
Midway through the first half UT-C had
run up a 26-12 lead, but Davidson
showed signs of renewed vigor and cut
the margin to a three point deficit at
30-27. UT-C turned the ball over giving
the Cats a chance to cut the margin to
one point. Haynes, who had 25 points

that point it was all downhill. for
Davidson, and by halftime UT-C was up
45-34.

Being down by eleven points called for
a running game, but Biedenbach pointed
out ‘‘Davidson can’t play for long
periods of time in an up-tempo game
with a team like Chattanooga. We
pressed them late in the game, forced a
lot of turnovers, and got more baskets,
but also gave up too many opportunities
to them, Biedenbach said.

The loss dropped Davidson to 8-4 in
the conference (10-11 overall) and moved
UT-C into a tie for first. However, UT-C
came up on the short end of a cross-state
rivalry with East Tennessee Monday
night to leave them in second. All that
sets up a showdown for Davidson
Saturday, when the team travels to
Greenville, S.C. to play Furman. A win
over the Paladins is no less than
essential to Davidson’s regular season
title hopes.

‘‘We have our work cut out for
us—they’re all tough games. A true first
place team wins the league from this
point on. It’s laid right out there for us,”
Biedenbach said.

“We can’t look back. We can’t say,
‘We should have won this or that game.’
If we win, we'll do it. If we're a first
place team.”
