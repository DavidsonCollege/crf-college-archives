An timate
evening witht
the Carolina’
Charnber
SyYmMphiovly

By Liz Lockett

Directed by 26-year-old
Robert Franz, the small and inti-
mate Carolina Chamber Sym-
phony delighted the audience
Monday night in Hodson Hall
with an array of music. Earlier
that afternoon, the director, flut-
ist, and composer of the cham-
ber group held an informal gath-
ering to share their musical back-
grounds and. experiences with
Davidson students.

Franz assembled: the en-
semble approximately three
years ago. More recently,
Lawrence Dillon composed a
flute concerto specifically for
the extremely talented flutist
Elizabeth Holler. This new and
exciting piece was featured dur-
ing the second half of the perfor-
mance.

First, the chamber group
played Symphony No. 71 in B-
flat Major by Haydn. This clas-
sical piece was rather light in
texture and style. The group
phrased and dynamically con-
trolled the piece well to create
an appropriate continuity of en-
ergy and sound.

On a different note, the sec-
ond piece performed was
Tchaikovsky’s Serenade for
Strings, Op. 48 in C Major. Since
-| the orchestral group is comprised
primarily of strings, this piece
was an excellent choice to per-
form. The unpredictable and
deeply romantic serenade re-
vealed another side of
Tchaikovsky’s musical capabil-
ity to the audience. As a sharp
contrast to the Haydn piece, it
exposed the group’s ability to
perform the rich, emotionally
deep quality of sound character-
istic of the Romantic era.

After a brief intermission,
Dillon’s Concerto for Flute and
Chamber Orchestra was heard
by a new and eager audience.
Dillon utilized extended flute
techniques, such as over-blow-
ing and flutter-tonguing, to cre-
ate a distinctive, twentieth cen-
tury sound. The piece is based
upon a simple, three note motif.
By altering.the character of the
flute, this motif expands for 25
minutes through three move-
ments. The last movement con-
sists of a combination of two
polar flute characters to create a
tense yet vivacious ending to a
wonderful performance.

With such an atypical pro-
gram, the performers and Franz
displayed immense skill, depth,
and diversity. This relatively
new and young chamber en-
semble is sure to continue in
their success.

BYOB: BRew YouR Own BeeR

By Katharine Laidlaw

Hard to believe, but lately,
there’s been more than just coffee
brewing at Davidson. As part of
the Union-sponsored “Ch
ers,” Davidson studen
ulty are able to reap the expeyience
of seasoned beer-brewet David Bo-
rax and learn just how easy it is to
whip up a case at home.

Borax, an editor for the Char-

lotte Observer’s “Local” section, ,

began home-brewing two years ago
in-Cambridge,.Massachusetts. He
believes that the advantages to
home-brewing begin with saving
money, but ultimately he enjoys
being able to control how his beer
will taste.

Freshness, for example, is a
key consideration when it comes

to premium beer. There’s no way
of knowing just how long that six-
pack has sat on the shelf of the
mini-mart.

Most national brands add pre-
servatives and pasteurize their
beers, all of which can have dire
effects on its flavor. At home, the
beer-brewer is in control of all
facets of his beer’s color, taste, and
age.

Borax recommends that the
first step to begin home-brewing is
to buy The New Complete Joy of
Home-Brewing by _ Charlie
Papazian, a guide which Borax
confirms is the bible of this craft.

The materials can be pur-
chased at specific beer-brewing
stores, such as Alternative Bever-
age in Charlotte, or even through

catalogs.

All together, the actual sup-
plies and the ingredients needed to
brew your first batch cost about
ninety dollars, but once you’ ve in-
vested in the hardware, you’ll be
making two cases of premium beer
for the price of two dollars a six-
pack.

North Carolina. law prohibits
selling beer which you have brewed
at home, but how close you stick to
the recipe is your own business.
Variations in the ingredients can
change the alcohol content, color,
or texture of your beer, but to brew
successfully, Borax stresses the
importance of cleanliness.

He is meticulous about wash-
ing his materials both before and

after using them, using purified
spring water, and making sure his
beer is not exposed to air. After all,
unwelcome bacteria is a twist on
the recipe for which your beer just
might not forgive you.

If you’re ready to take the
plunge, call Alternative Beverage
in Charlotte and ask when their
next free demonstration will take
place.

Or if you’re more impressed
with the idea of “home-brewed”
beer rather than actually having to
stew it up yourself, visit the
Dillworth Brewery, where they fea-
ture different types of home-
brewed beer each week. Who
knows — you may never drink
Budweiser again.

When I first heard that senior
Cat Grimmell’s play had advanced
in the American College Theatre
Festival’s playwriting competition,
I was anxious to talk to her. Di-
rected by senior Scott Lenhart, the
cast of The First Time includes
Davidson students Christine
Hietzenroder, Amber Sharick,
Heather Baldwin, Caroline Ritchie,
Amanda Bryan, Jennifer Tracy,
Renu Bhatt, and Eleanor Hatcher.
The play will be performed at the
Taylor Auditorium in Greensboro
on February 2, where it will be
judged against four other plays
based on its viability as a produc-
tion. If the play continues to ad-
vance, it could end up as a profes-
sional production at the Kennedy
Centerin Washington, D.C. Need-
less to say, I was very pleased to
get a chance to talk with both Cat
and Scott about the play.

Could you tell me alittle about the
plot?

Cat: It’s about SEX, that’s what
it’s about!

Scott: [laughing] You don’t have
to put that in there. . .

Cat: It’s about eight women who
have been pretty much good friends
throughout theircollege career, and
one of them just had her first-time
sexual experience. They all know

Her Very First Time

Cat Grimmell loses her stage virginity

about it and decide they’re going
to have a party for her, kind of a
rite-of-passage—morelikeaguy’s
first time, like ‘way to go, you did
it baby, you joined the club.’ So
they plan all this stuff, and it’s kind
of astory about how that’s positive
and negative and how some things
go wrong. All the women start
telling about their first-time sexual
experiences, and it’s a mixed bag.
There’s one girl who gets gang
raped, and one girl who regrets her
experiences; and it moves through
like that. It’s about eight women
who are kind of like women you’d
meet at Davidson — different per-
sonalities obviously, but the same
upbringing.

You mentioned that the musician
Tori Amos influenced your play.
How?

Cat: I was listening to Tori Amos’s

first album, and that’s kind of how —

I got the images and the ideas for
the play in my head. The song
“Silent All These Years” really
struck me. There’s a perception
that women don’t talk about sex,
and we really do. People talk about
sex. But a lot of times the painful
aspects of sex aren’t talked about.
It’s not meant to be a play that’s
down on men, but there are mixed
reactions to men. It’s about how
sex can be dividing and bonding at
the same time.

Having a male director is kind of

an interesting choice.

Scott: Yeah, it is very interesting.
Every day I learn something, and
I’m like, ‘Does this really hap-
pen?’ But it’s very exciting, and
I’m learning a lot about writing,
about directing, and about rela-
tionships. I’ve never worked with
this many people before, but
everyone’s very energetic and very
giving, so there really isn’t a prob-
lem. I’m learning a lot, as Cat is,
just about the process. We’re all
contributing, and things are chang-

ing as we move from day to day.

Cat: It is so collaborative, it feels
kind of like a family right now. I
think the hardest part is feeling
like, no matter where we get with
it, come February 2, it goes on.
Like it or hate it, I’m sitting in that
audience. I feel really lucky, espe-
cially as a beginning writer, to be
working with Scott and all the ac-
tors. I’m very scared about having
it done, but I have a lot of faith in
them. I just need to have faith in
myself.

Movie Review

Tiska picks

Blockbuster’s best

By Tammy Tiska

Breathe a sigh of relief — no angst-laden movie review this week.
I’m taking my cue from Rachel and offering my own list of favorite
movies. The only problem I had with Rachel’s choices was Sheltering’
Sky, the entirety of which went over my head. Here are some pretty
mainstream movies that you may have overlooked while wandering
the aisles at Blockbuster. My apologies to all the anti-Hollywood
knee-jerk film liberals who only watch foreign or black-and-white
films. That’s a list for another day.
3. Thelma & Louise. 1 know, it’s a staple in the diet of Generation X
feminists, but don’t let that scare you away. This drama about waking
up to life on a Western highway has something for everyone, including
many moments of comic brilliance. One of the most disturbing and
controversial endings in recent movie history is reason enough to see
this film. And for all those new jump-on-the-bandwagon Brad Pitt
converts, this is where he gothis start. This is also the only video I own.
2. What’s Eating Gilbert Grape. If you heard of this film, it is probably
due to Leonardo DiCapria’s amazing performance as a mentally
