SUPPLY PASTORS SERVE 18 CHURCHES

Boots, Two Guns, A Bible Semester Break
Are Preacher's Gear

By CHARLES ROSE
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Davidson men spend their weekend free time at many varying activities and in
many distant states and cities, but when Sunday morning rolls around, the majority
of some thirty-five students head for neighboring communities to preach a Sun-

day morning sermon.

Supply pastors, most of them
ate called, but a few have a
regular pulpit to fill two times
a month. Those that don't
preach play the organ, direct
the choir, teach a Sunday
School Class or direct other
type of youth work.

This whole program of stu-
dent supply work is under the
direction of the YMCA. Church-
es in need of a preacher or
other leadership help contact
the Y office and a student is
notified of the request. About
thirty-five interested students
have signed up for the jobs and
are called whenever needed. A
good number of these boys are
pre-ministerial students who
take the calls for the experi-
ence of preaching to a congre-
gation.

The program they offer is
up to themselves. The college
in no way regulates the student
preachers except in one area.
A student cannot accept a re-
quest through the Y office to
preach for more than two Sun-
days a month. The administra-
tion has made this a poticy
because of the possibility of
interference with school work.

The congregation that re-
quests student supply work
usually pays for the expenses
involved in traveling to the
church, but if it is unable to do
so, these expenses are taken
care of by the YMCA. During
the 1957-1958 school year Da-

Kuykendall Calls
For Exam Honesty

John Kuykendall, student
body president, requested this
morning in chapel that all pos-
sible diligence and action be

displayed during the next two:

weeks to remove any suspiction
of cheating during exams. The
announcement was a statement
authorized by the Student
Council.

The council, in a short meet-
ing Monday night, discussed
the matter of the preceeding
statement, forthcoming _ busi-
ness for its February sessions,
and other minor reports.

“The council issued a
similiar request last spring dur-
ing final exams,” Kuykendall
explained, “and it was felt that
it aided in the matter of dis-
honesty. In general we ask that
students avoid doing anything
which would give the appear-
ance of cheating.”

During the eight day exam
period, students are urged to
leave all textbooks, notes and
other study aids outside of
Chambers or wherever the
exam is administered. Only
writing materials and other
necessary equipment should be
carried into the building.

Kuykendall also asked stu-
dents this morning to refrain
from setting off firecrackers.
He stressed the potential dan-
ger involved, even though in-
jury might not be intentional.

filled 462.

speaking and preaching en-
gagements in churches and
communities over a wide area
around Davidson. Eighteen
churches are at present being
continuously supplied by stu-
dents and faculty members.
All of the boys interviewed
concerning their supply preach-
ing work had just about the
same general opinion of the
benefits they derived from such
work. At the top of the list

is the satisfaction gained
through the expression of their
religious beliefs. Supply

preachers from Davidson mean
a great deal to the small rural
communities that they serve,
and it is not at all rare for stu-
dents to make strong friend-
ship within the congregations.

Butch Farabow, a Junior, and
a regular supply pastor says.
“The people in the church I
go to really appreciate my ef-
forts. Theit church is just a
small frame building and the
congregation usually isn’t too
large, but they are all sincere
and very interested in every-
thing I attempt to put across.”
Butch usually goes out twice
a month and receives about
twenty dollars a Sunday “de-
pending on the offering” he
says.

“One thing that I really no-
ticed,” Butch said, “was that
the grown ups bring all of their
children to church with them.
Things can get noisy sometimes
and I may even have to stop
talking when they do, but I
think all the families get more
out. of church by coming to-
gether.”

Probably‘ the most unique
area supplied by a Davidson

student preacher is Love Val-!

ley near Statesville, N. C. Love
Valley is the dream of a man
named Andy Barker, who for
many years wanted to build a
community completely western
style, and his dream is slowly
coming true. Fred Streetman, a
senior here, regularly preaches
at the Love Valley Presbyte-
rian Church. Fred says, “None
of the streets are paved and
there are no cars on the streets;
everybody rides a horse. All
of the buildings are made out
of rough boards and there is
a rough board sidewalk in front
of them.”

Everybody that lives in Love
Valley wears cowboy boots and
blue jeans and ten gallon hats.
The men all wear loaded guns.
Fred said that the people are
all interested in horse shows
and rodeos. “Every Saturday
night the people gather in the

Fred said that one time he
was going up to the church to
preach. It was raining and the
road was mighty slick. His car
slid off the road right in front
of a “settler’s” house. Fred said
he went up on the porch and
when the man of the house
came to the door he took one
look at him and his car in the
ditch and without another word
said, “Damn city driver!”

The congregation of the
church has about forty mem-
bers who all wear blue jeans
on Sunday morning. “You can
tell they are clean clothes,”
Fred said, “and the men even
wear their guns to church.”
Harry Pascal, a senior at Da-
vidson last year, used to preach
at Love Valley regularly. Pas-
cal wore both cowboy boots and
guns when he preached. Fred
Streetman said he hadn't
bought any guns yet.

On Wednesday afternoon, the

Dr. Staples reported to the
DAVIDSONIAN the early part
of this week that the Religious
Life Committee will meet Mon-
day afternoon, January 19, in
order to discuss the anticipated
problem of overcrowdedness in
Sunday night vespers.

“Hell” Freezes Over
In Unanimous Vote

Interfraternity Council this week voted unanimo::siy
to call the week of fraternity pre-initiation ceremonies’

“Greek Week.”

“Greek Week will be held harassment commonly associ-

sometime during the last of

|February,” stated Vernon An-

derson, IFC: President. The
council voted to send each rep-
resentative to his fraternity
executive committee and presi-
dent in order to get their ideas.
The representatives are then to
present the issue to the fra-
ternity at their next meeting
for discusion. The IFC will con-
fer at its next meeting to make
definite plans for Greek Week.

Last spring the IFC passed

their resolution declaring tra-
ditional Hell Week practices
permanentiy abolished and
then presented it to the fra-
ternity faculty committee and
the entire college faculty for
approval. “This leaves the
IFC open te propose some-
thing to the faculty. it’s left
up to us to replace the void.”
Anderson stated that he hes
investigated Greek Weeks
of other schools eround the
country. He also has calied
on the council representa-
tives to suggest possible pro-
jects or activities.

Richard Brubaker, Secretary
of the IFC, cited projects the
ATO’s have carried on in the
past during their Help Weeks.
Other ideas submitted included
a Pledge Field Day, an IF Sing
for the pledges, cleaning up
behind the fraternity houses,
and landscaping the fraternity
court. The council stressed the
importance of competition
among pledge classes. A com-
mittee was appointed to investi-
gate on-campus projects and
bring new ideas before the
council.

“1 think we want one big pro-
ject with twelve phases or
twelve small projects. Dr. Mc-
Gavock is investigating some
projects not pertaining to the
campus,” Anderson comment-
ed.

President Anderson read the
following official statement
which the retiring IFC passed
last April to clarify their form-
er activities:

Question: Has the Student
