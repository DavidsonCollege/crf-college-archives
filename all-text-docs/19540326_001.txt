Plans Get Underway
For Spring Frolics

The Interfraternity Council be-
gan work in earnest this week on
plans to make Ray Anthony's ap-
pearance at Spring Frolics, April

rw

23 and 24, the highlight of the
|

year’s social activities.

Anthony will play for the formal
dance Friday night, the informal
Saturday night, with a concert on
the lawn in front of the Union Sat-
urday afternoon.

Tickets will be sold in the usual
manner, by IFC members to the
fraternities, and through a special
representative to independents. As

‘Thas been the policy at previous

dances this year, independents
must buy a special independent
ticket.

This will be Anthony’s second
appearance at Davidson, he having
played for last year’s Spring
Frolics.

Anthony, the “Young Man with
a Horn,” ascended to his position
as leader of America’s top dance
band via one of the greatest suc-
cessions of record hits in the his-
tory of the recording industry.

At a time when singers were
dominating the nation’s waxworks,
the name of Ray Anthony, through
the medium of Capitol records,
literally skyrocketed across the
record scene. During his first year
with Capitol, in 1060, Ray chalked
up sales figures of more than two
million records and clicked with
such outstanding disc hits as
“Count Every Star,” “Sentimental
Me,” “Can Anyone Explain,”
“Autumn Leaves,” “Harbor Lights,”
“Dreamer’s Holiday” and “Never-
theless.”

Ray's tremendous recording suc-
cess proved a boon to the entire
dance band business for it en-
couraged other recording com-
panies to put greater emphasis
on dance bands than ever before.

One of Ray's major objectives in
his recordings is to keep
America dancing to his music and
among his biggest disc favorites
have been his own musical crea-
tions such as “Mr. Anthony's
Boogie,” “Mr. Anthony’s Blues,”
“Cook’s Tour,” “All Anthony and
No Cleopatra,” “Sky Coach,” and
“Lackawann Local” as well as his
own recorded interpretations of
such standards as “Darktown
Strutters Ball,” “Tenderly,” “Til
See You in My Dreams,” “I
Wonder What’s Become of Sally”
and “Harlem Nocturne.”

CONCERT BAND ON TOUR

CONCERT BAND LEAVES FOR ’54
SPRING TOUR ON NEXT MONDAY

The Davidson College Concert
Band, frequently hailed as one of
the South’s outstanding collegiate
musical organizations, will present
concerts in Augusta and Waycross,
Georgia; and in Perry, Tampa, and
West Palm Beach, Florida, during
the annual spring tour which be-
gins on Monday, March 29, and
ends on April 3.

Kenneth R. Moore, assistant pro-
fessor of music and director of
the band, will conduct the series
of programs. Mr. Moore, an out-
standing clarinetist, is a graduate
of the University of Mlinois and
Juilliard School of Music.

Composed of 50 selected musi-
cians—this year all from Southern
states, the Davidson College Con-
cert Band has won numerous
honors in the last decade to place
it in the foremost ranks of con-
certs bands. Originally organized in
1910 as a 25-piece “marching band,”
it was reorganized in 1933 as a
“eoncert band" by James Christian
Pfohl, former Director of Music.
Esch spring the Concert Band
makes an extended tour through-
out the eastern seaboard.

The Mendelssohn “Overture for
Band” and George Frederick
Handel’s “Royal Fireworks Music”
will highlight this musical tour.
All in all the program will in-
clude more than a dozen selections,
ranging from the stately music of
Handel and Rimsky-Korsakoff to
the thrilling strains of John Philip
Sousa and Leroy Anderson. Other

works to be played are by Samuel
Barber, Elie Siegmeister and
Harry Simeone.

Fred Hudson of Miami, Plorida,
trombonist, and Mason Field of
Charlotte, N.C., trumpeter, will be
the featured soloists on tour this
year.

The Davidson College Concert
Band has been heard in the past
years coast-to-coast over several
national radio networks, on
numerous tape-recorded programs
throughout the Southeast, and in
1952 was invited to play at the
convention of the National Music
Educators Association in Philadel-
phia. In addition the band has ap-
peared before numerous bandmas-
ter meetings and music educators
conferences.

Satterfield Conducting

John R. Satterfield, director of
the ROTC Band and the Football
at Davidson College, is the as-
sistant conductor on this South-
ern tour. Mr. Satterfield, an as-
sistant professor of music at Da-
vidson College, is a graduate of
the University of North Carolina.

A part of the training which
the student musicians receive
under conductor Moore is practical
work in arranging and organizing
concerts. The members of the
bands receive no academic credit
or remuneration for their activities.

A large share of the business
operation of the organization is
handled by the members and of-
ficers of the band. David Pfaff,
Winston-Salem, N.C., serves as
president of the organization; Fred
Hudson, Miami, Fla., vice-presi-
dent; Haywood Rogers, High Point,
N.C., executive committeeman;
Thornwell Frick, Spartanburg, S.C.,
business manager; John Fite, San-
ford, Fla., secretary; and William
V. Porter, Jr., Charlotte, N. C., li-
brarian.

Ray’s tremendous success on
records and the constant play ac-
corded his platters by the nation’s
disc-jockeys have combined to
make him a consistent winner of
name band popularity polls from
coast-to-coast.

Scholarship Finalists Visit Campus;
Three-Day Tests Now In Progress

Finalists in the Baker and Union
Carbide Scholarships competition
are now on the campus. They ar-
rived yesterday, and are now in
the process of undergoing various
tests and interviews which will
continue through Saturday, March
27.

The sixth annual Baker competi-
tion and the second Union Carbide
drew a record total of 170 con-
testants. The Scholarship Commit-
tee expects to award about six
Baker Scholarships, two Union
Carbide grants, and three Davidson
Honor Scholarships.

Because the number of awards
offered is greater than in previous
years, the Committee has increased
the number of finalists from
twenty to twenty-seven and will
-devote three days to testing and
interviewing the finalists instead
of two days as formerly.

Half the finalists will be tested
on Friday; the other half will
undergo tests on Friday and be
interviewed on Saturday.

Scholerships Described

Baker Scholarships are awarded
to high school seniors who have
. demonstrated exceptional scho-
lastie ability, outstanding leader-
ship, and superior qualities of
character and personality. The

value of these awards ranges up
to $1,200 a year.

Qualifications for the Union
Carbide Scholarships are much the
same as for the Baker, with the ad-
dition that the candidate must be
interested in a career of business
administration or some activity
allied to the widespread interests
of a corporation such as the Union
Carbide Company. These scholar-
ships are worth tuition and fees.

Davidson Honor Scholarships,
valued up to tuition, will
awarded the runners-up in the
Baker and Union Carbide compe-
titions. The committee requires
these men to maintain high stan-
dards of performance from year
to year at Davidson.

There are now in the student
body twenty-one men holding
Baker Scholarships, four on Union
Carbide awards, and three on
Honor Scholarships.

white gloves to round out the
equipment necessary to give a
snappy appearance to this honor
platoon.

Consisting of twenty-six sopho-
mores, the platoon was formed
under the leadership of Captain
Russell Hatch, now stationed in
Atlanta. For the past several weeks
at ROTC drill it has performed in-
tricate movements in front of the
regiment. The honor unit marches
separately, leading and reviewing
all parades.

Lt. Howard Lamar is now in
charge of the platoon, with Ser-
geants Jeter Abernathy and Bob
Stogner acting as his cadet as-
sistants: Larry Wright, Bubba Mar-
tin, and John McLauchlin have
been selected as squad leaders and

Members of Eumanean Literary
Society enjoyed an interesting
meeting Monday night, March 15,
as scheduled.

The meeting began with the
reading of a well-prepared paper
by Stuart Vaughn on the in-
domitable Glenn Cunningham,
holder of the mile record in in-
door track. The paper was followed
by the devotion, roll call, and read-
ing of the last meeting’s minutes.
Then the president, Charles
Hasty, opened the, business of the
meeting.

The main business discussed
was the coming debate on the
chapel question scheduled for
April 5. Hasty also approached the
issue of a combined banquet with
Phi.

Will Terry introduced a motion
to go through with the long-de-
layed “secular” chapel program,
and he was therewith appointed
chairman of an arrangements com-
mittee to plan the program.

Larry Parrott'’s paper, “The Day
I Lost My Glasses,” made up the
humorous part of the program.
Following this, a quiz was given
on popular modern novels and their
authors, much to the intellectual
embarrassment of the members.
The meeting ended with the be-
ginning of concrete plans for the
chapel program, which wil] be
along the traditional line of faculty
pantomine.

OFFERS MANY JOBS):

For boys who want to gain valua-
ble experience this summer and
who wish to earn money for the
coming school year, the Y place-
ment program offers much needed
assistance in finding jobs.

The positions are spread over
a wide range of interests, locali-
ties, and pay scales. The national
and state parks offer the “out-

door type” ample opportunities,

while the YMCA summer camps
gives those interested in the social
fields a fine chance to gain first-
hand experience with various types
of individuals. For the sciences and
business majors, jobs in industry
and business are available.

Samples of the work include gas
station attendants at Yellowstone
National Park, research work at
Aberdeen Proving Grounds in
Maryland, field advertising with
Proctor and Gamble, work on
cattle boats to Palestine, and of
course, a host of counseling jobs
at various summer camps. Good
counselors are very much in de-
mand this year.

It should be remembered that
this program points out job op-
portunities but does not guarantee
that the person applying will get
the position. The program is ex-
pected to get into full swing now
that the spring holidays are over,
with Sam Magill and Jeter Aber-
nathy holding single and group in-
terviews.

Blood drive officials announce
that the American Red Cross is
making an urgent appeal for 24,
000 pints of blood desperately
needed in veterans’ hospitals
throughout the nation.

The demand for blood donations
today is greater than ever. Since
the Korean truce donations have
sharply declined; yet vast
amounts of plasma are continual!:
needed for wounded G.I.’s still
undergoing treatment.

The need is serious. The quota
of 24,000 pints must be met by
June 1. To do so will require ‘in-
tensive participation by Americans
in this spring’s blood drives.

Good Record

In the past, Davidson has re-
sponded exceptionally well to the
blood drives. It is hoped that the
students will continue to do so
next week, especially in light of
the Red Cross’s plea for extra
participation.

The Bloodmobile’s facilities will
again be set up in Johnston Gym-
nasium, and trained nurses will be
on. hand to perform the trans-
fusions. The ROTC Department
will assist in administrative details.

Part of the blood received at
Davidson will remain in the coun-
ty for local use, but the greatest
amount will be sent to various
Red Cross blood banks to offset
the deficit realized by veterans’
hospitals.

; Releases

Students under twenty-one are
reminded that they must obtain
written permission from their
parents .in order to give blood.
Release forms are available from
fraternity chairmen or the ROTC
Department.

The giving is safe, simple, pain-
less, and only takes a few min-
utes.

Sponsors of the current blood
drive are Scabbard and Blade and
ODK. Charley Hasty and Fred
Stowe are acting as co-chairmen.
