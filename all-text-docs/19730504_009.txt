victory.

The long ball came back to
the Cats this game as both
George Weicker and Mark

Rodgman hit some long home
run shots.

These three losses pushed the
Cats" record back to 9-14 with

problem.
“We keep having men on base.
and can't seem to get the runs
around,” Burris commented.

There have been several
games this season when the
team has stranded as many as
twelve men on base during the
game. Burris has tried to
remedy the situation to no avail
by juggting the lineup in the past
few games.

Burris felt that the other fac-
tors responsible for the team's
dismal plunge have been errors
and pitching.

“Overall, the boys have
played great defnese, it just

“It's really tough not to get

i when you keep
losing and you know you ca
beat the other team.” Burris
added.

The next game for the Wild-
cats will be today against Bap-
tist College. It will mark the
pitching debut of Pete Celantano
who is laying down his statistics
pencil.

Tew Anchors Cat Staff

By MARK CONNORS
Asst. Sperts Editer

The Davidson baseball teain,
recently plagued with a bad
luck streak, has relied heavily
on the arm of freshman Joel
Tew.

Tew, the Cat’s premier pit-
cher, hails from Wauchula, Fila.
Although interested in the
University of Florida and of-
fered a scholarship at Southern
Florida Junior College, Tew
decided to come to Davidson
because ‘I wanted to go to a
small school, and wherever |
went I wanted to play baseball,
I had a great deal of correspon-
dance with Coach Stevens and I
decided an out of state school
like Davidson is what I really
wanted.

At present, Tew is planning a
career in law, with an un-
dergraduate degree in
economics.

“I might change my mind
though,’’ Tew stressed.

Up to this point, he has found
Davidson to be very interesting.

‘I’ve really enjoyed this
year. The competition has been
real strong and the success I've
had with baseball has really
helped me get along and enjoy
everything,’’ he commented.

Tew has been one of the keys
«0 the baseball team this year.

He presently has a 4-2 record
with wins against William and
Mary, Baptist College,
Methodist College and Guilford.
His losses came against ECU
and Furman.

“The loss against ECU was a
close one and I only pitched four
innings in the Furman game,”
commented Tew.

Although the baseball team’s
record has suffered somewhat
just recently, Tew felt that their
early season play was in-
dicative to the kind of ball that
Davidson was capable of
playing.

“It just seems that we got
jinxed,”” said the Cats’ right-
handed ace.

However, Tew expressed op-
timism .in future Wildcat
baseball.

“A majority of the team is
returning next year and most of
us will have another two years
together. I just hope that next
year we will be able to play the
kind of baseball we're capable
of playing,"’ Tew said.

Tew stressed the key role new
head coach Jack Burris has
played in the baseball program
this year.

Hunter Goes To Regatta

By JOHN McELVEEN
Staff Writer

Due to complication in
scheduling, the single-hand
sailing championships,
originally scheduled for last
weekend, will be held this
weekend.

Though Daryl Douglas had

planned to participate in this
S.A.1S.A. regatta, he has a con-
flict; MCAT’s will be ad-
ministered the same weekend.

Consequently Jimmy Hunter
will replace Douglas and at-
tempt to gain a second berth in
the National Single Hand Com-
petition.

Unfortunately, this S.A.1.S.A.
regatta, was well as MCAT's

conflicts with the ‘‘Lake Nor- °

man Invitational” regatta to be

‘[nours ond you can rerum heme the came doy sa |

held at the Lake Norman Yacht
Club. Six of Davidson's ‘‘Jets"’
will makeup one division in this
large scale regatta. Over 180
boats will participate.

Frank Somerville, who has
been quite active on the Sailing
Team, and who participated in
this regatta last year, is
favored.
