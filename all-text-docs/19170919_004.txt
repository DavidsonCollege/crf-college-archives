The Philanthropic Society will begin
the year with a new constitution, which
calls fur several radical changes. There
will be only Gne meeting a week of the
Senior society which will take place on
Saturday night. At this meeting the
program will consist of a debate, oration
and declamations by the class on duty.

The constitution also provides for a
Junior society, which consists of Fresh-
men and upperclassmen who have receiv-
ed less than three credits This society
meets on Monday night, the vice-pres-
ident of the Senior society presiding.
Shortly before the spring term closes the
members of the Junior society who have
received six or more credits are voted on
for membeship in the Senior society. By
this arrangement neither the Junior nor
the Senior sncicty will be too crowded
for the frequent participation of — its
members,

The Eumenean Society will continue
to operate its Freshman society on the
plan used last vear. As vet no arrange-
ment has been made for only one meet-
ing a week, but the society svill act upon
this at its first meeting. This action is,
necessary hecnuse recitations are now be-
ing held on Mondav, the college holiday
in past years.

Of course the new men know that
the literary societies offer opportunities
for development and friendships which
can be had in no other way.

The present Freshman class is com-
posed of one hundred and two mem-
bers. This is about seventy behind last
year’s Freshman class. There are of
course a few to come yet. This is as
good as could be expected under the
present condition of affairs. The new
men are a nice looking crowd and will
doubtless be a credit to the institution.
