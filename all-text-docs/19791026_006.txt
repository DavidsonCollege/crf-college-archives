Ruth Ault

By ELIZABETH WILSON
Staff Writer

Ruth Ault’s teaching style
has been characterized as ‘‘live-
ly but thorough,” and she is
said to have an excellent rap-
port with her students. Perhaps
this is because, as one student
put it, “‘you have a feeling that
it hasn’t been too long since she
was a kid herself—like maybe
last summer.” That no doubt
comes in handy for Dr. Ault,
whose specialty is child psycho-
logy.

Her own childhood years were
spent in Chicago; from there she
went to California for her under-
graduate work at Pomona Col-
lege and her Masters and Doc-
torate (in developmental psych-
ology) at UCLA. Before coming

¢ to davidson she held an assis-

tant professorship at the Uni-
versity of Utah at Salt Lake
City.

She is very pleased with
Davidson in general and the
students in particular. ‘‘There is
a great contrast between David-
son students and those at a
major public university, and the
difference is decidedly in their
favor. Davidson students come
to class prepared and are not
afraid to speak up.” She feels
that the small classes are con-
ducive to developing rapport
with students.

In addition to her profession-
al interests (check out her book
on children’s cognitive develop-
ment sometime—you “don’t

have to be 8 peych major to

appreciate it), Dr. Ault enjoys
bicycling and

with her husband, who is a
computer in Char-
lotte.

for the Old Men and expects to

Professor Krentz is now living
here in Davidson. Although he
finds teaching a lot of work, he
says ‘‘I like‘Davidson a lot. I’m
enjoying it very much.” Pro-
fessor Krentz says it is nice to
be out of school and he finds the
