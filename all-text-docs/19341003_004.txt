State won over the Wildcats Saturday
night, but they didn’t do it without plenty

of trouble. “This revamped aggregation
of Coach Hunk Anderson's is certainly a
polished machine, with a vast amount of
power and speed, and Saturday evening
they showed an unustally good spirit,
which is more than could be said of any
team from the technical institution in
the last few seasons.

In spite of all of their potency it
was no easy job for them to push
over those seven points against
the ’Cats, who always fight. John-
ny Mackorell, being pretty well
covered on his offensive play, only
averaged eight yards per try run-
ning with the ball, but he made
up for his lack of ground gaining
by the wonderful defensive work
he did. The Wildcat captain was
in on practically every tackle and
quite a number of times he stop-
ped State advances unassisted.

Big Jim Morgan was right in there
getting his share of the tackles too, but
probably the greatest thrill the Wildcat
fens got all night was when this depend-
able fankman leaped into the air between
two opposing backs and snagged a high
pass thrown by Mackorell.

While we are talking about this
man Morgan it might be interest-
ing to comment on the way he can
punt that old speriod. He is de-
cidedly the best kicker on the
Wildcat squad, when it comes to
distance, but it takes a little too
much time for him to get his foot
into the leather after it has been
snapped to him. When the team
practised in Charlotte last Thurs-
day night Jim was consistently
booting them between sixty and
seventy yards.

One of the most striking features of
the State battle was the fact that there
was only one pen: lty during the whole
contest. Davidson lost five yards for
heing off side. It was one of the clean-
est and fairest played games I have ever
seen. The only thing that has come to
my attention which was even slightly un-
sportsman like, is a report that the Wolf-
pack men would m:ke an effort to get
Davidson substitutes engaged in a conver-
sation when they first entered the game
so the officials could penalize them for
talking before they had taken part in one
play. This bit of jesty gabbing gained
nothing for thé Techmen, however.

Another interesting fact about
this affair is that every Davidson
man who took part in the game
lives within a hundred mile radius
of Davidson. There are few col-
lege teams in America that don’t
have to go much farther than a *
hundred miles to get a group of
football players as good as David-
son has this year.

Coach Gar Davidson, he:d mentor at
the United States Military Academy, evi-
dently remembers the Wildcat team of
1929, because in his speech to the Army
student body a few weeks ago, he rated
the Davidson game as the hardest home
engagement the Cadets would play this
season. The Wildcats enter this contest
on fairly even terms so far as weight is
concerned, and I believe they are just as
good football players as Coach David-
son's proteges, so it wouldn't surprise me
it all if the 'Cats bumped-off Mr. Buck-
ler and all of the lads at the Point.

Brilliantly For Duke

With a surprising show of power and
speed, Carolina®and Duke convincingly
defeated their opponents by unusu Ily
large scores last Saturday, and thereby
bolstered their standing in the Big Five

Wildcat Flankman

Conference.

Coach Carl Snavely’s ‘Tar Heels drub-
hed a highly rated Wake Forest team,
21-0, exhibiting a finesse end punch
which exceeded the fondest hopes of
Carolina supporters. The Deacons were
outclassed in every department of play
and incurred many penalties for unneces-
sary roughness as they fought desperate-
ly to halt Carolina’s mounting score.
Duke's Blue an even
greater sensation by trouncing the V. M.
I. Crdets, 46-0. Scoring only six points
in the first half, the Blue Devils, led by
they brilliant Corky Cornelius and Jack
Alexander, came back in the second
period to run roughshod over the Cadets
and crossed the goal six times to pile up
40 points.

Devils created

Duke's passing attack—was-espectally
effective when Arlington Kelly, 125-
pound back, entered the game to exhibit
an une; nny accuracy in dropping his long
tosses into the arms of Liana and John-
son.+ The Blue Devils attempted nine
passes and completed six of them for a
total gain of 120 yards. V. M. I. failed
to complete any of their three attempted
passes,

Next week-end, members of the Big
Five Conference will furnish even more
interesting competition. All but oné of
the scheduled games will be played with
out of state teams.

Davidson will be in the limelight next
Saturday when they journey to West
Point to meet the Army in an intersec-
tional game of interest to the entire
South. Sports writers of the New York
papers are predicting that the spirited
Wildcat team will furnish a real battle
igainst the Cadets.

Carolina will engage the Tennessee
Vols at Chapel Hill. Coach Snavely’s first
edition of the Tar Heels have already
proven their power but they will doubt;
less have their hinds full in this game.

Corky Cornelius and his Blue Devil
will entertain the Tigers of
Clemson at Durham. This is Duke's first
home game.

profusely. He gave the Felines

J/M MORGAN - END

Big Jim Morgan, star Wildcat end
who has played excellent ball in both
of the two starts that his team has made
thus far this season, is a very likely
hope for the mythical All-state eleven
this fall. His pass receiving has been
particularly outstanding.

WHITE WINNER
OF GAKE-RAGE

Twenty-Eight Prizes Donated By
Local Boarding Houses and
Business Men

Rick White of Jacksonville, Fla., last
Thursday afternoon led a field of 58
members of the class of 1938 to win the
annual Freshmen cake race in eleven
minutes and eleven seconds.

In-this- cross-country jaunt of one and
seven tenths miles, the red-haired lad
from the sunshine state was followed by
Roy Gilks, who came in approximately
three yards behind the winner. Fresh-
men Dowdle and Parcell were third
and fourth respectively.

The record for this mile and seven
tenths course is held by Earle Frazier of
the Junior class, who covered the course
in 9;35.5. From this start as a runner,
Frazier has developed into one of the
most outstanding runners Davidson has
ever produced. Last year »hé)won both
the mile and the two «milé events
at the state track meet at Chapel Hill,
breaking the existing state records for
both events. Frazier also holds the ‘col-
lege record for the freshman two mile
cross country course.

In the Thursday's race 28 prizes were
awarded to the men finishing between

KITTENS MEET
DARLINGTON IN
OPENING GAME

Barrow, Dennis, Harrison and
Hogan Will Probably
Start In Backfield

Freshmen Swing Into Action
Friday at Richardson Field

The Davidson Wildkittens will open
their 1934 gridiron schedule Friday after-
noon at 3 p. m. at which time they will
meet the Darlington Tigers, a prep
school of Rome, Georgia, at Richardson
Field.

The opening lineup for the Kittens will
be somewhat as follows. At ends Nichol-
ason and Williams appear,to have won
over the posts with Raider and Callo-
way ranking probably third and fourth
respectively.

At guards you can take your choice of
Gray, Shytle, and the two Green bro-
thers, Bob and Brent. Gray and Brent
Green however seem to b& the bes bets.

Freeman. and Graham will probably
open zt tackle with Moore and Goodman
being held in reserve while Overall will
be at-center. Faison is now running sec-
ond string center. :

In the backfield Wade Barrow, who
hails from Denver, Colo., will call signals
with Hogan and Harrison at left and
right halves respectively. At full, Den-
nis, who showed to good advantage in
the varsity scrimmrge, will get the call.

A second string backfield is composed
of Lafferty, Sparks, Charles and Alex
Brown.

The Wildkittens will have plenty of
trouble on their hands when they face
this invading eleven from Georgia who
have some fine material down that way.

In Walter Hackett of Rome, Darling-
ton has an All Mid-Southern quarterback
of- last year. Also in the backfield will
be Jimmy Leach, a halfback, who played
on the National Interscholastic champion
football eleven of Knoxville, Tennessee,
high school last season.

Two guards, Frank Huguenin and Dan
Beattie, who hail from Greenville, S. C.,
are plenty good and will be able to take
care of their position in no uncertain
manner. '

Several of the Darlington men of last
season aré this year on the Kitten eleven.
Among these are Bailey Williams who
was alternate captain of the Tiger squad
last season and Billy Nicholason. Both
are ends and have alrezdywon_berths on
the freshmen team.

Others who played at Darlington last
year are Oren Moore and Billy Sparks
who arg, showing up well.

Last Wednesday afternoon Coach
Laird got a chance to see his proteges
under fire for the first time this year. In
a scrimmage with the varsity they dis-
played plenty of defensive ability.

They were not given a chance on the
offensive and therefore-their ability in
that capacity is not as yet known.

Freeman as a tackle, broke through
consistently to break up Wildcat plays
in the scrimmage but the work of the
two ends, Williams and Nicholason, was
probably the most outstanding feature.

Hunk Anderson Praises
Wildcat Quarterback

A telegram received in the office
of the publicity department from
Coach Heartly “Hunk’’ Anderson
of North Carolina State reads as fol-
lows: ‘Johnny Mackorell is a great
triple-threat back. He is better in
my opinion than any back we have
had at Notre Dame since March-
mount Schwartz. Mackorell, will do
everything as well if not better than
Buckler of Army.”

This is a very high compliment
paid the Wildcat Captain, not simply
because it comes from Mr. Anderson
who should know football players,
but because of the fact that he com-
pares the versatile Wildcat with
Army’s All-American, Jack Buckler.

It will be interesting to see these
two backs in action at West Point
Saturday.

WILDCATS PLAY
WEST POINTERS

Davidson and West Point Cadets
Are Expected To Use
Aerial Attacks

The Davidson Wildcats will leave to-
morrow for New York City where they
will encounter the United States Mili-
tary Academy Saturday afternoon at the
West. Point Stadium.

This will be the third game of the
1934 gridiron season for the Cats while
the Cadets will be playing their second.
Both teams have a victory at present but
the Wildcats also have a defeat on rec-
ord which they received at the hands of
the North Carolina State last
Saturday night.

eleven

The Army team will find the Wildcats
is tough an eleven to beat as the team of
"30 who all but defeated the Cadets. At
the half the Davidson team was on the
good side of a 7-3 count and except for
the fact that the Cats hadn’t the reserves
they would have probably walked off the
field with a win. However, they weak-
ened in the last half and the Cadets went
ahead to chalk up three touchdowns and
took the contest by a 23-7 score.

The Wildcats with Mackorell at the
helm will be out to defeat the Army at
their own game, an aerial attack. The
Cats have a very nifty passing combina-
tion and will put all they have got into
pulling an upset and conquering the
Army team.

Last Saturd.y night the Cats put up
a wonderful fight against a stronger and
heavier eleven and only for a_ third
period touchdown they would have left
the field with a moral victory.

The Cadets, on the other hand, were
none too impressive last Saturday in their
initial contest with tle Washburn Col-
lege, of Topeka, Kas., whom they barely
managed to defeat by a 19-0 score. The
Cadets were held in check for the first
three periods by the 194-pound Washburn
line and were not able to get started
until the later pert of the closing period
when they started their aerial attack.

Joe Stancock is the captain of the
West Point team this year. He and
Jack Buckler are two of the few letter

WILDCATS BOW TO ’PACK
IN GAME SATURDAY NIGHT

McAdams Carries Ball Over For
Lone Score In Beginning
of Third Quarter

MACKORELL ’CAT STAR

Davidson Shows Great Spirit In
7-0 Defeat

A powerful and sustained drive by the
State College Wolfpack in the third
quarter resulted in a 7-0 defeat for the
Davidson Wildcats in the first Big Five
encounter of the year.

Playing under “the afc lights in Me-
morial stadium; Greensboro, the out-
weighted Wildcats held their own against
a rejuvenated State organization for two
quarters, but were unable to withstand
the alternate attacks of Rex, Roy and
McAdams in the march at the opening of
the third.

Capt. Johnny Mackorell, Davidson’s
All-American prospect, was the backfield
star of the ’Cat team, along with little
Midge Verble who, sent in as a substi-
tute, knocked down two State passes and
intercepted one more intended for one of
two six-foot ’Pack ends.

The Davidson line, Siewers, Lee and
Morgan starring, up-set the dope by re-
fusing to be crushed by the powerful and
much vaunted State line. State College
presented a fine array of backs in Rex,
Roy, McAdams and Farrar.

Mackorell opened the game with a
bang by slipping around right end for 25
yards and the first first down of the night.
An unsuccessful pass and an equally un-
successful line play forced the 'Cats to
punt. State hed the advantage the re-
mainder of the first half although
Davidson fought successfully to stave off
a SCOFE, be

State received the ball at the beginning
of the half on the five-yard line, Roy
carrying it up to the thirty. McAdams
and Rex hammered the line successfully
and a pass, McAdams to Redding, put the
ball in position for Rex to score. Mc-
Culley place kicked the extra point.

Davidson came back and threw a scare
into the State followers by making its
one big threat. A duo of successful
passes, Mackorell to Morgan, put the
ball on the seven-yard line with but one
yard to go for a first down. A loss on
a line play and pass over the goal broke
the spirited ’Cat rally.

State continued to hammer at the
Davidson line for the fourth period and
both teams suffered from some inter-
cepted passes. Mackorell took the team
from what seemed certain disaster by
running 22 yards from punt formation on
the one-foot line.
