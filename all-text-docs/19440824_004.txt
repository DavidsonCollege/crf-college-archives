FOR’ THIS IS DAVIDSON

The spirit Sf a century haunts
And permeates these halls,
Where men of Davidson have

learned
The truth that never falls.

Tradition and its mystic mien
Is not an empty thing,

For here it has its fullest stand
As years their echoes ring.

Here lie the bricks which Wilson
touched,
Which caught the heroe’s gaze.
To time's immortal covenant
These columns proudly raise.

A year is like a minute passed

To one who knows so much;
Assembled -here is wisdom's form-

The loot of worlds and such,

A love for college is not hard
To hold beneath the sun,

If one but stops to reminisce
The span of Davidson.
