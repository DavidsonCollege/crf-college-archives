NUMBER 1

Reforms to Alcohol Policy in the Making

By GARY WHEELER

Last spring’s Greek Week
incident in which three Davidson
students were taken to the hospital
for alcohol poisoning. combined
with the local media coverage that
the episode received has brought
Davidson’s alcohol policy under
close scrutiny.

Although there has not-been
any change to the Patterson Court
Council (PCC) alcohol policy yet,
reforms are in the making.

The PCC, which is respon-
sible for writing the alcohol poli-
cies for Davidson’s fraternities and

eating Clubs, has already met sev-
eral times this fall to outline pos-
sible changes tothe alcohol policy.

A small committee met Au-
gust 29 to propose additions to the
PCC alcohol policy. These sug-
gestions were presented to the PCC
for amendment at its September 2
meeting.

The tentative reforms must be
re-written and voted on by each
eating house and fraternity before
the additions become enforceable.

The proposed additions to the
PCC alcohol policy are:

- Weekday parties, Sunday
night through Thursday night,
alcohol will stop being served at

1:00 A.M. . Weekend parties,
Friday and Saturday nights, alco-
hol will stop being served at 2:00
A.M. .

- At any Patterson Court
sponsored party, a party monitor
will be present and his or her re-
sponsibilities. shall include the
following:

- The monitor shall be present
any time alcohol is being served.

- The monitorcannotconsume
alcohol before or while on duty.

- The monitor must have ac-
cess to a phone, a security officer,
and transportation, preferably, an
automobile.

- The procedures for the moni-

tor to follow in the event of an
emergency shall be posted: by the
phone, along with the name of the
monitor on duty at each party.

- The monitor ensures that
alcohol is no longer being served
after the appropriate cut off time.

- A-security officer must be
present when three or more houses
co-sponsora party and, preferably,
at other large parties.

- Aminimum of $40 of alter-
native food and beverages must be
available.

These proposed additions do
not go as far as Dean of Students
Will Terry would have liked. Terry
sent a letter to each of the national

fraternity headquarters this sum
mer petitioning support for broade
changes to the alcohol policy.

Terry encouraged the frater
nity headquarters to exert “all the
pressure possible to sce that a sen-
sible, enforceable policy is en-
acted.”

Some of the changes that Will
Terry advocates that are not in-
cluded in either the existing PCC
alcohol policy or the list of pro-
posed changes are: alcohol served
on a BYOB basis, the serving of
only beer and wine, (not liquor),
and the adoption of a dry rush by
fraternities.

one of the options considered to handle
the increase, according to Terry.

“We talked about renovating the old

done the best we can do,” Terry said.

~ Class of 1994 Makes Problems As Well As History

By BAILEY FOSTER

The large size of the freshman
class, the largestin Davidson’ his-
tory, is primarily a result of the
fluctuating applicant pool, which
produces different student yields
from year to year. Though the
enrollmentis up last year, the extra
students are causing some incon-

*veniences and adjustments on
campus.

The admissions process is a
complicated one whcih involves

input from many different areas.
TheEnrollment Planning Commit-
tee, headed by Dean of Admis-
sions and Financial Aid Robert
Gardner, meets twice each semes-
ter to determine the number of
continuing students, :
According to Gardner,
Davidson, unlike larger universi-
ties, does. not have an integrated
system in which one office has

complete data on the total enroll-

ment, both on-campus and abroad.
“Here, it’s a little bit differ-
ent,” said Gardner, “because a lot

of different people have pieces of
information which are notcentrally
collected, so instead of an inte-
grated system where one person
has.a pretty good idea of who’s
leaving, enrollment planning is a
new concept here because there’s
no real way to gather the data.”

Using the estimated figures
from the committee and the yield
from the previous year, the admis-
sions office then has to decide how
many offers to make in order to
bring the enrollment up to the
desired level.

The estimated size of the fresh-
man class, according to Gardner,
was about 400. The next step is to
decide how many students of each
gender to admit, using a male/
female ratio which is set by the
Board of Trustees.

Beyond those figures, admis-
sions also muct decide how many
students to admit from each list,
that is early decision, regular deci-
sion and wait list. The yield from
the wait list is usually 100 percent
since applicants are under contract

to attend Davidson if accepted.

“We wanted 400 freshmen,”
said Gardner, “so then you doearly
decision, based on the pool, sub-
tract off the number of paid depos-
its; and therefore, estimate the
number of regulars, minus what-
ever wait-list activity you want to
do.”

The next step is to play a
guessing game to determine the
number of students who will ac-
cept. A lot of factors are influential
in the process, the most important
being the relative selectivity of the
schools with which Davidson
competes. tl

“Tf you think the schools that
you compete with,” said Gardner,
“are up in applications and will be
more selective, then you want to
hold more places on your waiting
list. On the other hand if you know
it’s going to be a tough year where
selectives are down, then youdon’t
want to hold many spots on the
waiting list because those kids may
not be there.”

Davidson's yield from regu-

lar decision has been about 50
percentoverall. However, the yield
for men and women was uneven
this year, causing the extra fresh-
men.
“This last year the yield for
men came way up, and the yield
for women dropped,” said Gard-
ner. “And essentially we’re over
25 men.” ae

According to Gardner, it has
become much harder to predict the
numbers of returning students and
incoming freshmen. because the
yield, which used to be the most
steady statistic in admissions, has

_ been fluctuating in recent years.

“The problem rightnow is tha!
the yields are changing from year
to year,” said Gardner. “What's
