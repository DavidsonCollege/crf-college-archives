Last week the faculty launched a cam-
paign to annihilate all the -pidgeons on
the campus, referring to them in a rous-
ing-eall to battle issued by Treasurer
Jackson’s office as pests and unnecessary
evils.

‘Tuesday afternoon, mercenaries, arm-
ed to the teeth, were imported to begin
the extermination, but despite much ac-
tion, no pidgeons were killed. Cheered
on by a squadron of future flyers on the
parade--ground, the pidgcons—retreated
in order, with no casualties.

lications, and it is the Staffs desire that
it maintains this high position. However,
this will not be possible if it does not re-
ceive more aid and support from the
students. We are not saying that every
member of the student body should con-
tribute to The Davidsonian, although
it is a good thought, but there are some
students who are talented in newspaper
work who should be helping their paper
somewhat and are not.

Most of you will read this article, or
maybe not even read it, and say: ‘Well,
isn't that the biggest bunch of bull you
ever read?” Maybe this is a lot of bull,
but it is the truth and is a sad truth at
that. However, without more help The
Davidsonian will not be able to maintain
its standards and will be a reflection on
the college. Fellows, let’s don’t let that
happen!

you ever sat

the table—cross-examined yourself?
It takes a man to stop himself and
say, “Now look here, Me, there are
some things that need rearranging
inside. It's time for spring cleaning.
It is time to cut out this or that
thing and fill in the gap with some-
thing better. Are you satisfied with
yourself, Me? Don’t you have some
higher aspirations that you've just
been winking at? Well, what are
you’ waiting for—get busy and
straighten yourself out. And re-
member this, you can have God's
help-if-you'll -ask—Him for-—it.”

Sometimes it helps to talk to
someone else about yourself. An-
other person often sees something
in you that you probably don’t even
realize is there. In 1910 the Y. M.
C. A. expressed its aim in the one
sentence quoted at the top of this
column. The Davidson “Y” has al-
ways been more than just a Social
Center, but I’m wondering if it is
doing all that it can towards pro-
moting Christian growth among its
members and carrying on the work
of Christ in the College and Com-
munity. Will you help keep our
Y “straightened out” with your
sincere criticism. (There is a sug-
gestion box at the office.)

Variety ... Sho’
The general impression as I get

We feel that before the Davidsoir pid=

‘geon, like its cousin, the carrier, is ren-
dered pre-historic by the grounds force,
some attempt should be made to bring to
the minds of students the finer qualities
of these birds, and to remind them of the
faithful service of pidgeons in past
years.
The faculty seems determined that the
pidgeon menace shall be disposed of, and
we feel that some record should be made
of their passing.

A pidgeon, it seems to us is a bird of
dignity and beauty, to bétreated with re-
spect and even reverence, for, as the say-
ing goes, ‘Women and Pidgeons. — Look
up at them long enough, ete., ete.” The
absenc® of our little friends will leaye an

With The Staff ....

Two eek ago the new 1944 David-
sonian made its debut and-we sincerely
hope that* it met with the approval of the
student body. “Phe Davidsonian is a
newspaper that is published for the stu-
dents of Davidson College and presum-
ably is published by the students them-

selves. However, this has’ not been the
case lately. It has been published by a
thinute number of students who are

greatly pushed to do all the work that is
necessary for its success as a college
newspaper. -

Inethe past-the-Davidsonian has held
a high place in the ranks of college pub-

smelling the food being cooked, talking
and laughing, and settles down with the
idea of getting the devotional over as
quickly as possible, in order-to comment
on the announcements to follow.

That, it seems to us, is the wrong atti-
tude. Not only is the Scripture wasted,
but the noisy atmosphere is not the
proper way to be reverent. Two rem-
edies have been suggested by students;
to cut out chapel 6n Tuesday and Thurs-
day altogether, and to omit the devotion-
al periods on these days. The latter
seems more logical, especially since the
student body needs some time for its an-
nouncements. and meetings. The staff
would appreciate any letters from fac-
ulty or students‘ giving their opinion of
this matter.

Happy Birthday ....

The Twenty-fourth celebrated its first
anniversary of life at Davidson last
week, for on March 1, a year ago, the
first 250 air crew boys marched in in
the rain. Strained “relations began at
once. When they were not cussing
the Sothern weather, the “junior -bird-
men” cussed the students for making so
much noise at night, and the students
cussed the air crew for making so much
in the morning.

So almost at once the two groups sep-
arated. Students visiting other - col-
leges with training detachments won-
dered why no effort was made to improve

Mr. Tom (elmer) Connor was our

for Uncle Sam’s navy. He wouldn't

to be a “Cadaver” in a Naval Med

Still much can be doie. Lt is rare
to see a civilian speak do a soldier
on the campus, although speaking
to everybody is a tradition of the
college. Co-operation on both sides
is needed.
