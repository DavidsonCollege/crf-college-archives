Ghosts
inthe
Graveyard

By Courtauld McBryde
On a crisp autumn evening, when the moon is full and
the leaves rustle beneath your feet, you can almost hear the
voices of the dead as they whisper in the cemetery on the
north side of campus. They whisper tales from a time when
there were no cars, no telephones, and not even a railroad.

Origin of the College Cemetery
The cemetery plot was established in the 1830s on the

police
receive top
N.C. honor

By Susan Warren

Davidson College Police recently received the high-
est award given to college police in North Carolina. The
Superior Crime Prevention Award is given annually by

the North Carolina Department of Crime Control and

Public Safety. Davidson College’s crime prevention

was named number one in North Carolina among col-

lege police departments.

The award is based on how well crime is prevented.

Davidson’s police department has many crime preven-

tion activities. In the past year they have spoken about
crime to freshmen and their parents, provided brochures
concerning travel safety tips and crime prevention,
conducted a program for residents of The Pines con-
cerning safety and security for the elderly, sponsored

rape prevention seminars, and offered a self-defense
class.

The police department’s biggest problems con-
ceming crime include faculty not locking their office
doors and students not locking their dorm rooms.

Police Sergeant David Harding emphasizes says,
“We try to prevent it before it happens.”

Women's soccer
captures title

By Krisy Ford

Going into the game against Furman on Sunday, the
Wildcats had already clinched the regular season title,
but they had something else to prove. Prepared to
avenge their 2-1 loss to Appalachian State earlier this
season, the women’s soccer team headed into their last
home game full of energy.

The team secured their number one seed Saturday
against the Paladins in a 3-1 victory,.becoming the first

Registrar extends pass/fail deadline one week

By Beth Lindsey

If you have ever felt rushed in
your decision whether to take a
class pass/fail, the SGA has passed
a resolution that will help you.
They voted last week to approve a
resolution which recommends that
the pass/fail petition period be ex-
tended one week: through the end
of the regular registration period.
This would be a change from the
current policy, which requires that
pass/fail petitions be submitted to

the Registrar’s Office within the
two-week drop-add period.
Guatam Srinivasan, a senior

. senator who presented the resolu-

tion last Tuesday, says the primary

reason for the resolution is that the

“Council of Academic Affairs was
concerned with students not hav-
ing enough time to make their
deicisions, especially when they
have to go through the drop/add
period late. This resolution would
give them more time to gather ad-

equate information on which to with the registration period.”

base their decisions.” ;
The resolution points out that
the regular registration period lasts
three weéks while pass/fail peti-
tions are due within two weeks.
Registrar Polly Griffin says, “The
Curriculum Requirements Com-
mittee is also interested in making
the pass/fail period coincide with
the registration period. It makes
sense that the period of time to
select a grading scale correspond

each year while juniors and se-

The pass/fail policy at
Davidson permits students to elect
to take a class which awards them
a credit without receiving a letter
grade, A class taken pass/fail may

“be used to satisfy a core require-

ment; however, it does not usually
count toward a major credit. In
order to receive a P, a student must
make a C- or above in the class.
Freshmen and sophomores are per-
mitted to take one class pass/fail

niors may take one each semester.

Says Srinivasan, “I think stu-
dents will be pleased with the extra
week and will find it very useful to
have, giving them more time to
decide and to hand it in.”

The resolution will now pro-
ceed to the Educational Policy
Committee. If recommended by
this committee, it will be imple-
mented if the faas a whole ap-
proves the measure.
