The April order of supplies for the
Red Cross has just arrived. ‘The ma-
terial has been delayed for about two
weeks on account of shipping facilities.
and has caused the work room to be
closed for lack of supplies. The sup-
plies come from Washington, and their
misplacement made it necessary for
someone to go to Washington to trace
them up.

The new order is for three hundred
face bandages. This is the largest, by
far, of any order yet received.

The work room will now be opén on
the regular days: Mondays, ‘Tuesdays.
Thursday and Fridays. Everyone _ is
urged to be present on these days.

round bout between Longjaw Liston and |}
some other great fighter. Spence is put-
ting Liston in excellent shape, having
reduced him ten pounds in the last week.
Liston Wants sixty per cent of the gate
receipts, but prefers a guarantee of “two
hits.” As the battle must) be fought
somewhere in the United States, well
would suggest as the arena, the new
gymnasium, on account of its freedom|}
from books, chairs. water, and other
equipment. Promoter Spence announces
a two-round draw between Stukes Bur-
