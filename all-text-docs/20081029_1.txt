President Tom Ross ’72 and Rep. John : Spratt 64 after Convocation Ie last Saturday,

Following Saturday's convoca-
tion speech, The Davidsonian sat
down with Rep John Spratt ’64 (D-
S.C.), chairman of the House Com-
mittee on the Budget. Spratt,was
Student Body President during his
time at Davidson. The following
are excerpts from the interview.

Davidsonian: What role do you

see college students, and Davidson
students in particular, playing in af-
fecting social change today?
Spratt: Well, now you can vote
when you’ re 18. We were not voting
citizens until 21. So that makes a
difference. And I think the students
of today are a bit more interested
in politics, partly because of the

media-phenomena like C-SPAN,
for example, bringing politics into
the living room. The internet, of
course, is just a huge, anarchic ex-
panse. If you ever get on the wrong
side of the bloggers, you’ll know
what I mean.

D: Are you referring to a spe-
cific incident?

pratt: Exclusive interview

JS: I was having a conversation
with [former Democratic National
Committee chair] Don Fowler on
the airplane coming back from the
convention in Denver. And he said
‘The hurricane is due to hit New Or-
leans right about the time the Min-
neapolis Convention starts.’ As you
can tell, I’m a little hard of hearing;
I’ve got to get a new hearing aid. I
said ‘I understand the hurricane is
coming up the eastern seaboard.’ I
thought he said New York not New
Orleans. He said, ‘No. No. New
Orleans.’ Then he said, ‘God is
just.” Well, there happened to be a
guy right behind me who recorded
it with his cell phone. He put that
up on YouTube, and the last time I
checked that thing got 400,000 hits.
There’s not much you can do about
it. You can put out disclaimers;
you can put out explanations; you
can hope people read some sort of
cross-referencing. But it’s a pow-
erful underground medium, barely
above ground medium.

D: Which way do you think
North Carolina will go?

JS: Well, I’m an optimist. I
think itll go for Obama.

D: Do you think he has a shot in

Many parents and students
passing by Chambers Lawn last
Saturday paused for a peek at the
buzzing commotion between Phi
and Eu Halls, two of the oldest
buildings on Davidson’s campus.

They soon discovered that
the spirited speaking, in turn with
cheering and shouting, was a part
of a presidential debate between
representatives of the Young Dem-
ocrats and College Republicans.

Young Democrats Zeke Web-
ster 09, DJ Carella ’09 and Alice
Phillips ’12 stood behind a podium
on the balcony of Phi Hall, while
College Republicans Mike Juce-
wicz °10, Ryan Gough °10 and
Jenner Gibson ’11 faced them on
the balcony of Eu Hall.

and community members formed

most standing in the middle and
turning their heads back and forth
to watch the speakers.

The event marked the third
such presidential debate between
Young Democrats and College Re-
publicans, the first having taken
place during the 2000 presidential
election, remembered as one of the
most controversial election years in
American history.

This forming tradition may be
a move to resurrect Davidson’s lost
debate history. Formal debating
on campus began between the two
literary societies, Philanthropic So-
ciety and Eumanean Society, both
founded in the college’s inaugural
year, 1837, and still alive today.

Each had their respective halls
built in 1850, conveniently facing
each other for the purpose of cross-
society debate.

Some old debate topics include:

quence more influence over the hu-

Political .Connection — will
host an election night party on
Nov. 4 in the.900 Room start-
ing at 7 p.m. This will be the
culminating event in a series of
political events sponsored by the
Political Connection.

Political Connection is a
bipartisan effort by the Young
Democrats and College Repub-
licans. to increase awareness
around this year’s Presidential
election, according to Dr. Pat-
rick Sellers, a professor of Po-
litical Science.

After receiving an $8,500
grant from the Improve Davidson
Fund last spring, Political Con-
nection this year has organized
four events plus a nonpartisan
voter registration drive.These
events included the debate be-
tween the College Republicans
and Young Democrats, hosted
Saturday.

While these events have
been critical parts of Political
Connection’s goal to increase
awareness this fall, the election
night party was the keystone
part of the grant proposal. :

Their party, according to
Sellers, will be “very much. a
student-run event.” This party
is a joint effort of Political Con-
nection and the Union Board,
as well as other supporters who
have not been confirmed yet. =

The plans for the night in-
clude gag gifts, lots of food, a
political version of the popular

, word game Mad Libs, a bar from
_10 p.m. to | a.m. and, of course,

election night coverage by CNN
projected on the big screen in the

900 Room.

DJ Carella, President of the
Young Democrats, said that
Chick-fil-a and Domino's will
be catering late into the night,
and the Union Café will have
special food for the night. “For
example, you could order. a ‘Joe
Biden’ for dinner,” Carella said.
