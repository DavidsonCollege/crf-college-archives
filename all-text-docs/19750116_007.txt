A very touching story from a
. Davidson student has reached
my eyes and ears, and I feel
obligated to share it with you:
‘‘You should have been there,
Lance,”’ I said while sitting on
the toilet on the first floor of the
Little Library.

“Really, the game was great.
Some guy from the other team
mistook Larry Horowitz’s head
for the basketball, and got a
traveling charge put on him.”’

I could hear Lance, in the
next stall, flipping the pages of
the G.R.E. sample booklet.

‘Oh yea, did he return the
favor?” Lance mumbled.

“No,’’ I called out, ‘‘he just
kept on playing like a good
Christian and never blinked an
eye-lash. In the end victory was
ours, and the good guys were
victorious.’’

“Lance hadn’t been to a game
in five years, ever since he
mistook a basketball game at
the coliseum for a boatshow
during his second sophomore

men’s room, I armed Lance up
to the smoking lounge. I could
see he wanted to talk about it.
‘How come you don’t attend
the basketball games, Lance?’’

“Oh, I just have so much
work. I’m taking, you know, two
courses, and besides, my
girlfriend calls on Saturday
nights‘around 8:30 p.m.”’

Lance lit up the wrong end of
his Winston. It was evident that
he felt guilty about missing the
St. John’s game. I tried to com-
fort him.

“You know, Lance, your girl
could call you on Sunday.
Besides, she lives in Watts. And
you could study Saturday af-
ternoon instead of Saturday
night. Don’t you want to cheer
your team on to victory?”’

I knew I had a full mental
press on Lance now. He squir-
med in his seat.

“Yea, I do,’’ Lance began.
“But if I go I’d look stupid
cheering. I’m not one to stand

year.

After we finished up in the

up and quote ‘rip ‘em up, Tear
‘em up’ and all that bullshit.’’
Lance’s eyes were filling up

Davidsonian Re-Examines Role

This issue of The Davidsonian will reach
more readers than any other single issue

printed in the past. More than 4000 alumni,
parents and other friends of Davidson will
receive a free copy.”

The reason for such a move surpasses the
very real motives of increasing sub-
scription revenues and keeping more
readers informed about current news and
opinions at Davidson.

The reason lies at the basis of the
editorial policy which the new Davidsonian
staff wil be implementing during the next
year.

It is an idea reflected in Kenneth
Boulding’s'statement which appears above
the editorial column this ‘week--‘‘The
meaning of a message is the change which
it produces in the image.”’

Just as The Davidsonian will re-examine
the potential of its current verbal/visual
presentation to affect the community, we.
must also reach more people concerned
with Davidson if we are to be promoters of
change in the message Davidson presents.

Davidson has ridden on its ‘‘Princeton of
the South” image for many years, but we
have gotten virtually all the mileage we
can from that comparative relationship. In
terms of student SAT points earned before
arrival at Davidson and in terms of faculty
credentials accumulated before coming to
Davidson, the comparison is not totally in-
commensurable.

Yet in terms of the effect we have on each
other in this community and the effect
Davidson has on ores outside of its a,
mediate community, the comparison wi
Princeton is simply not valid.

Davidson advertizes its sense of com-
munity as a major drawing card to pro-
spective students. Yet perceptive seniors
‘write that they are only now, after three
years at Davidson, beginning to recog-
nize that sense of community. We have for-
feited our ability to affect this community,
and we schedule our lives to keep it from
affecting us. .

We have imposed superficial standards
upon ourselves to ebiagi an eat aca com-
munity. Whimperings of great demic
pressure here are not juxtaposed with pub-
lications of innovative student |
We have exerted pressure on ourselves to
learn the same facts that previous students
learned, but we have not placed pressure

on todo creative
Faculty tenure has been. a more

prevalent topic of conversation than the in-
hovative research tenure allows professors

to pursue. And our Princeton ‘‘publish or
perish’’ standards break down when we ask
where the Davidson printing press is
located.

I’m afraid our printing*press is at the
Princeton of the North as are our Paul
Rudolph dormitories, art gallery,
chemistry facilities, fine arts building and

athletic field houses. Our public relations |

department claims we are a leader in
education, but closer examination reveals

that this claim cannot be supported.

Yet the editorial policy of The David-

sonian for the upcoming year is one which
will constantly scrutinize our ability to af-
fect Davidson to make Davidson effective.
We hope we will not simply motivate ‘‘a
willingness to contemplate what is hap-
pening,”’ but a willingness to make news at
Davidson through an examination of our

present image and-what that image could

be. The editors view The Davidsonian as
providing .a forum for opinion and crit-
icism; we hope to serve as a gadfly to this
community.

Andy Lamas, Mark Wilensky and I have
taken the responsibility of providing the
major editorial thrust of The Davidsonian.
Yet we also offer guest columns to anyone
whose image of Davidson differs from ours,
and we would be pleased to see our Letters
to the Editor column filled weekly.

Davidson is not Princeton, nor should it
try to be. Yet in terms of the effect David-
son has outside this community and the ef-
fect we should be having on each other
within this community, the ‘Princeton of
the South” image serves as a challenge.

And until this community demands more
of itself, we must recognize that the walls of
the Princeton of the South are not only
devoid of ivy, but that few members of this
community are'cultivating it.

(Ghandi Deserves Vote
As Person Of Century

Three quarters of the century gone.
By any account it has been one of the
more talked about centuries.

In this old house which saw the 18th
and 19th centuries one would hope to
develop a perspective.

But the place communicates with me
in subtle ways and a sense of per-
spective is not always easily obtained by
a human.

Churchill said something like ‘15
years is beyond memory for most and 50

_, years is antiquity.”

chill because he is often the nominee for.

It is obvious that few ‘women in the

Of course, the real person of the cén-
is me and I hope that you are your own
nominee.

However, if one public figure shines
above all others to me, if one person’s
contribution and potential effect for all
of us has been most evident to me; I
could only nominate Mohandus Ghandi.

This modern day purveyor of non-
violence, the example of the means

dependence without war, this was the.

‘Tearful Lance Regrets
Absence At St. John’s

with tears. I could see that my
counseling had taken effect. He
saw how important he was to
the team’s success. He had that
repentant, sheepish look on his
face.

Lance looked out the window
from where he sat, and then got
up and strolled around the room
shaking his head.

“Lighting that cigarette the
wrong way really messed my
eyes up. Wow that smarts. Have
you ever done that Mel?’’

“I don’t smoke, Lance.”’

Lance crushed his butt out
and wiped his tears from his
eyes.

“Lance, listen. Next week, we
play South Carolina. You can
ride in with me and Hildegard,
O.K.? She won’t mind, and you
can ride up front with her. She’s
a safe driver.”’

Lance looked grateful, but
managed to get out, ‘‘No Mel.
I'd rather, if I did go, ride the
bus, or go in with my friends.
We like to do a few numbers
before things like that. No of-
fence. You understand.”’

‘Sure, sure Lance,’ I said
victoriously.

Lance got up and left the
smoking lounge, laughing and
saying my name over and over
again. He saw I was right and
he was thanking me again and
again.

His laughter was a sign of a
new spirit in Lance’s old mind.
Lance finally saw how much the
team needed him. bee

The Davidson student is not
apathetic. The poor turn out at
the St. John’s game was due to
an earthquake in the basement
of the squash court. Luckily no
one was playing at the time it
occurred.

I know that all Davidson
students love and possess
school spirit. All they need is a
little counseling, like I gave
Lance. So my friends-- if you
know of someone who has, sq to
speak, missed the bus, take him
into your car and drive him to
the game yourself:

School spirit is essential.
Everyone has it, and the team
needs it. Don’t be a Lance, but if
you feel it overpowering you,
don’t panic. You too may.
receive counseling.

Before each home basketball
game at the coliseum, I will be
behind the Davidson bench near
that historic spot where Bo
Brickels’ jacket landed. Until
then, see you there, and peace!

Thanks Mel for sharing it with
us. Next week; Mel drives the
South Carolina team to Charlot-
te.
