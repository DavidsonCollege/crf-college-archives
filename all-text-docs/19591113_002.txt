Michigan: Welfare State In Trouble

. Michigan, .the epitome of social
welfare states, is in financial trouble
again—this time to the tune of 73 mil-
lion dollars worth of bills due it can-
not pay.

Last spring liberal Governor G.
Mennen Williams, intimate of United
Auto Workers’ boss Walter Reuther,
was forced to personally appeal to
the corporations he had often fought
for funds to pay state officials’ sal-
aries. General Motors advanced thir-
teen million dollars. The University
of Michigan and Michigan State Uni-
versity were operating on loans
against students’ fees; and bankers
were warning that no more loans
were forthcoming. During all of this
checks went out regularly to those on
relief—and welfare rolls continued to
swell.

Just in time to avoid bankruptcy a
tax plan was adopted which featured
a one per cent ‘‘use” tax, a device to
circumvent a constitutional limit of
three per cent sales tax.

Now that the state supr¢me court
na» thrown out the “use” ‘tax on the
grourds that it is a.subterfuge. Gov-

ernor Williams has called an emerg-
ency meeting of legislative leaders
to find a stopgap program to tide the
state over. Temporary measures un-
der consideration include liquidating
the investments in the state’s vet-
erans' fund—the only ready reserve
not already tapped. An increase in
business activities tax is also under
consideration.

The latter suggestion points to an-
other glowing difficulty: that of at-
tracting and keeping industry in the
state. Business leaders are all too
well aware of an “attitude. of hostili-
ty” which has caused many of them
to move operations, which in turn
cuts revenues and job opportunities
while swelling already too full relief
rolls. “¢

Michigan’s problem is a simple
one: revenues haven’t kept up with
spending.

Yet, this year’s state budget?
Twenty million dollars larger than
the previous budget—along. with 73
million in bills due which they can-
not pay.

Michigan—the “give-away” state.

College Beneficiary
If Cuts Changed

THE DAVIDSONIAN’S reopening
of the cut system issue has caused
rumbles on the campus.

We are glad to hear the rumbling.

Comments .and opinions have var-
ied from one extreme to the other.
Some agree with us, some disagree.
Others express surprise that such
definite steps have been taken toward
answering the problem, instead of the
usual dilly-dallying around that char-
acterizes so much of the discussions
on this campus.

We think all this discussion is
fine. We are glad to hear students and
faculty weighing the pros and cons
of the .matter. We believe that any
such exchange of ideas is a healthy
situation.

But we did not stir up this “sleep-
ing dog" just to provoke discussion
and, after all the ideas for and against
have been presented, to let the whole
matter die. We brought. up this prob-
lem in the hope of rectifying a situ-
ation that we believe is harmful to
the life of the college community.

To us, compulsory attendance
concerning classes seems apart from
the philosophy that is the basis for
a liberal arts institution. Such an in-
Stitution should exist for the purpose
of providing a foundation for a ma-
ture, well rounded life. We ‘feel that
a system that limits personal decis-
ions hinders the attainment of this
goal.

The DAVIDSONIAN does not plan.’
to let this issue die on the vine. We
expect some action to be taken by
the faculty and administration cor#
cerning this problem. We feel that if
our position is upheld and the rules
changed, Davidson College will be the
beneficiary.

THE ICONOCLAST

ICONOCLAST: One who attacks cher-
ished beliefs as shams.
e * * * * 2

We welcome a new publication to
campus. The ICONOCLAST, edited by
Peter Sterling, John Stone and Clint
Schaum, appeared to the few lucky
enough to get an issue this week.

It’s their name that we accept with
some reservations, and their basic
premise that Davidson is BIG sick.

The only way the ICONOCLAST
can be of any worth is to prove itself
a positive factor in making the Col-
lege a better one. To merely attack
cherished beliefs is easy, and they
will find much support in their ef-
forts. Many—too many—are ready to
attack without provocation or a basic
knowledge of relevant facts any in-

-Stitution. They will rant, rave and

curse with amazing prolixity only to
arrive right back where they started
with no progress having been made
toward a solution.

The ICONOCLAST must use its
new sounding board not only to tear
down, but also to build up. Merely
tearing down leaves one with noth-
ing; the act of rebuilding is equally
as important. And there’s no use
in rebuilding if the new structure
isn’t a superior one.

Our only advice to the editors:
don’t get so enthused over that big
name that you begin to move, and
make shams, without a purpose and
aim.
Good luck.

Les Comediens

Dr. Chalmers G. Davidson, profes-
sor of History, Director of the Library

Southern is quoted in the November
7 issue of the Saturday Review.

Appearing with Cleveland Amory,
well-known author, on a panel at

‘Coker College on the topic of humor

in American Literature, Dr. David-
son ‘is quoted as listing among his
favorite. humorists H. L. Mencken,
Dorothy Parker and “that person who
wrote that ‘all men are created
equal.’”

And may we naminate as other
outstanding humorists all those who
attempt daily to perpetuate this in-
congruity.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Students Voice Ire And Inspiration In. Three Letters

Larry Smith

Dear Editor:

Sparkle, sparkle, little twink;
How I wonder what you
think:

. a Zoroastrian mystic.

In your recent heart to heart
talk during Chapel hour, Mr.
Armfield, you asked the stu-
dent body to:

1. just imagine your date
dancing with a colored boy,
and

2. just think what could
happen!

Well, I've been imagining
and I’ve been thinking, and I
would just like to share my
thoughts with you on this mat-
ter, with no malice—just heart
to heart:

First, | noticed the cour-
ageous editorial “WE” carries
over in your expression even
when you ere speaking as an

individual. But then as you
so helpfully told us, you
were speaking for “the ma
jority of the Davidson stu-
dents.”

I guess I just wasn’t in on
your census of opinions, but I
would say from the tired re-
sponse of the students that day,
you may have been misin-
formed. I sincerely hope so!

Secondly, for me, the most
disappointing remark you made
was quite apart from your
clever summury of all the an-
tique abortions on the race
question. I am referring to the
statement that liberals on cam-
pus argue their views “merely
for intellectual honesty”.

This is the most bourgeois,
philistine comment ! have
ever heard—supposedly from
one of ‘the cream of the in-
telligentsia’. If intellectual
honesty is to be sneered at
‘here, Negro _ intellectuals
should be better off some-
where else: they would suffo-
cate before the Klan ever got
them.

Finally, and back to the ori-
ginal point, I wonder, Mr. Arm-
field, has it never occurred to
you that Negroes, if admitted
to Davidson, might voluntarily
decline from the social web
here, just as some, whose skin
is as white as yours have done
—in disgust? —

Also I wonder that we should
be any more worried about a
sharp date dancing with a Ne-
gro boy than with a loyal, su-
per-cool fraternity brother.
Aren’t people generally attract-
ed to beauty features of their
own race? Do you even suppose
that a-girl who would find you

charming would find a hand-
some Colored boy more 50?
With integration do you think
intelligent southern white girls
would suddenly get the ‘hots’
for shiny black skin, super-
curly hair, and flat noses with
flaired nostrils?

Or perhaps you tmagine
our women would offer them-
selves sacrificially as mothers
of the all new race of ‘inte
gration gray’. Do you think
strong Black boys admitted
here, and on a dance week-
end, shockingly exposed to

the erotic warmth of our vir-
gin white girls, would just
go wild and start raping our
fair young wenches on the
spot?

Certainly, certainly not! At
best this scene represénts an
interesting hypothetical socio-
logical experiment — at worst,
the weak gassing echoes of an

. unthinking generation.

Twankle, twankte little twunk;
Now I think you haven't thunk:
. . . a Zoroastrian ‘Crusader’.

Cheerleaders

Dear Editor:

Every week those of us at
Davidson who read and who
may be interested in the pro-
gress or decline of the varsity
athletic teams are subjected to
the column and byline (com-
plete with smiling photograph)
of Mr. B. Miliner.

This erudite young seor,
instead of reporting the news
hes a disgusting tendency to
prophesy and “crystal ball”

SORT OF LIKE AN ALBATROSS AROUND HIS NECK
“100,000 BOOKS - - - A MUST”

us to death. Sometimes this
proves interesting and un-
doubtedly he spends a lot of
time consulting his oracle.
But let us not hear him again,

lay the lash of his criticism on
others who may waste their
time, but nevertheless are at-
tempting to do a job.

“Inadequate Cheerleaders”

Don Follmer

Tommy Colvin

Dear Editor:

I would like to applaud the
appearance of ICONOCLAST,
Davidson’s voice of dissent. We
have long needed a medium
through which students (and I
hope faculty) can forcefully
state their disapproval of vari-
ous aspects of our college exist-
ence. The DAVIDSONIAN has
not in the past been a very sat-
isfactory outlet for such state-
ments.

We have now progressed
beyond the point of verbal
criticism; we find forthcom
ing printed criticism. If one
thinks, as I do, thet Davidson
is not an educational pare-
dise, one will certainly feel
that this is e step in the right
direction.

I think that it is important
to realize that the appearance
of this opinion sheet is not the
sole star on the horizon. Rath-
er, ICONOCLAST is just one
indication of. a current trend in
attitude.

The manner in which the
Book-of-the-Semester Program
was received is another in-
dication of this trend.

Even the IFC Homecoming
chapel should be considered a
part of the. current tendency
toward producing a lively cam-
pus. Certainly the campaign
(perhaps the first real cam-
paign here in years) for a
liberalized cut system now be-
ing conducted by the DAVID-
SONIAN is also indicative of
the present trend.

We are undoubtedly mov-
ing toward a more lively and
enlightened atmosphere.
However, we need more than
atmosphere; we also need ac-
tion. The climate among stu-
dents is such that we can
perhaps help the college
make a few steps forward by
some positive actions.

Let’s seize our opportunity.

College Library Figures Show Davidson Is Lacking

By DAVID JORDAN

According to the latest sta-
tistics released by the Associa-
tion of College and Research
Libraries, the Davidson College
library is classified in Group
II. This division denotes those
libraries which have a budget
of over $43,000. Prior to 1957-
§8, Davidson was’ in Group III.

“Before, we were classified
with Agnes Scott, Hollins, Ran-
dolph-Macon and Sweetbriar.
Now are in a group with Am-
herst, Bowdoin, Dickinson,
Swarthmore, Oberlin, Wesleyan
and Williams,” reported Library
Director Dr. Chalmers David-
son this week. “Thus we are
now compared with a group of
colleges which support. their 1i-
braries much more generous-
ly.”

STILL GROUP 41!

However, a study of ACRL
figures reveals that Davidson
does’ not compare favorably
with these well-known schools
of Group II. Morever, it does
not even compare very favora-
bly with schools recognized to
be much lower in scholastic
standing. In respect to book
stock, Davidson is still a Group
Hl library.

Davidson is embarrassingly
below the median in three
of the four main fields cov-
ered by the statistics—book
stock, volumes added yearly,
and periodicals. Only in the
number of newspapers it re-
ceives is Davidson well rep-
resented, and its superiority
here is out of proportion with
other figures.

The local library has 73,491
volumes, adds approximately
4,046 annually, and subscribes
to 38 newspapers and 390 per-
jodicals (this has been in-

creased to 438 since the ACRL
study was made).
“LOW ON STOCK”

“We resent having the ef-
ficiency of this libtary calculat-
ed by the number of volumes,
but yet we know 73,000 vol-
umes is not enough. We are
low on book stock,” Davidson
said. “For a library like ours,
100,000 is a must!”

In the ACRL study for Group
TI, which included 99 schools,
only twelve had fewer volumes,
and with the exception of three
small schools, Davidson has on-
ly a slight edge over these.

Examining those schools
with which Davidson usually
compares herself, the follow-
ing eye-opening conclusions
may be drawn: Amherst has
over four times as many vol-

(313,022); Bowdoin,

ymes

over three times (249,564);

Oberlin, over seven times
(538,135); Swarthmore, about
three times (209,301); Wes-
leyan, about six times (439,-

090); and Williems, over three
times (249,747).

At the present rate of addi-
tion, it will be at least 1965
before the library can attain
the goal of 100,000, a number
judged by the library staff as
the necessary minimum. De-
pendent on the extent of weed-
ing during that period, it could

take considerably longer.
~“Periodically, tne faculty
weeds. the stocks to remove
dead weight, books no longer
currently relevant and to re-
move excess copies of books
once in demand for reserve,”
Davidson explained.

“We could have well over
100,006 volumes in: a month’s
time, if we eliminated wecding
and took all the books we could
get free. However, we. feel that
the test of a good library is
not in the number of books
per se.”

However, it should not be

inferred that other top quality
schools. do not weed their
stocks just as consistently as
Davidson.

the budget is only $22,232,
which means we are steadily
falling behind these other
schools even more. A portion
of that figure includes the year-
ly cleaning and repairing of all
volumes.

Despite the alarming figures
the library administration finds
some consolation in the im-
provement in recent years, but
realizes this improvement must
continue and be increased. In
1936 the fund for books and
magazines was $2,500; last year
it was $20,000.

partment. The library has
two other separate funds
which are used to supplement

wise, the library orders those
which it feels are necessary.
In the ACRL ratings, only four
schools receive a fewer num-
ber of periodicals. Dr. David-
son admits that we look very
bad in that light.

Only eight schools can
claim more newspapers than
the Davidson library. This is
due to the focal policy of
subscribing to the newspa-
pers of every town or county
which has at least ten stu:
dents here.

“Since we are not an insti-
tution which awards research
degrees, we only attempt to
build up a library adequate for

honors students. However, we
still need a good bit more to
meet the demands of the honors
work,” Davidson said.

“We now have a first rate
physical plant and a_well-
trained, but small, staff. For
the first time, we have almost
everything needed as regards
the actual facilities.”

However, the most pressing
need as seen by the library
staff, is not an inerease in the
quality and quantity of books
and periodicals, but rather the
addition of a reserve reading
room on the second floor and
an extra staff member to ope-
Tate it. This room would re-
quire a number of alterations
to the present facilities.
