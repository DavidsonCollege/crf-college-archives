Vie For Majority Vote

Heffner And Jackson

The Faculty Committee on Fraternities, Clubs, and Social Life met Wednesday
afternoon to discuss problems concerning the off-campus drinking rule.

The outcome of the two-hour
discussion was a proposal to ar-
range for members of the com-
mittee to meet with each in-
dividual fraternity and present
the committee’s views on the
subject of fraternity functions
and drinking.

Dr. W. G. Workman, chairman
of the nine-man comniittee, said
they had asked IFC president
Johhny Rogers. “‘to ask the fra-
ternities to set up times, begin-
ning Tuesday if possible, to
have members of the commit-
tee meet with them and present
these views and discuss them.”

Workman made it clear that
“the committee is not propos-
ing a change in the off-
campus drinking rule.” Priv-
ate suggestions to two frater-
nities concerning scheduled
functions hed given rise to
some rumors thet the faculty
is changing or tightening up
its policy concerning off-
campus functions.

Workman said ‘1 don’t think
there has been any deliberate
increase in harshness. Some-
| thing has just been called to our
attention that we didn't know
about.”

The meeting was inspired, at
least in part, by the confusion
resulting from some informal
advice Workman had given
earlier to two fraternities about
scheduling cocktail parties as
part of their official functions.
He felt that such a party would
be an infraction of the off-
campus drinking rule.

Lenoir Rhyne Entry
Debaters Cancel

The Fresnmen debaters had to
cancel a scheduled entry in the
Lenoir Rhyne tournament to be
held March 7 and 8.

The trip was cancelled be-
eause of lack of practice. Only
one person appeared for the
practice sessions that were sup-
posed to be held Monday, Feb.
25 and Tuesday, Feb. 26. Dr.
J. T. Drake, the debate coach.
remarked that he “did not feel
like taking a team over there
that had not practiced.”

The South Atlantic Forensic
Tournament at Lenoir Rhyne
has 13 teams entered; however,
several have cancelled because
of adverse weather.

The only future trip schedul-
ed is one to the Tau Kappa
Alpha tournament in Muncie,
Ind. late this spring. The var-
sity team alone is going: it plans
to fly. This will be the first
time that the Davidson varsity
team has gone to the national
TKA tournament.

TKA is the national debating
fraternity. The tournament this
year is sponsored by the TKA
and Bald State Teacher's Col-
lege in Indiana. All the chapters
of TKA are invited to the con-
test.

Drake believes that the lack
of interest shown by the novice
team is due to the discouraging
showing of the team so far (no
certificates or titles won), lack
of time, and an unexciting na-
tional topic. He said that the
team needed to put much more
time into practice: about one
two-hour session of practice to-
gether and three or four hours
of research a week,

The varsity team has made a
better showing, about 5050.
However, this record does not
match the one made in the past
few years.

Drake noted that several
faculty members have indicated
that they are sympathetic with
the team's efforts.

Faculty Group Discusses
Drinking With Fraternities

BY RICK von UNWERTH
Davidsonian Staff Writer

The ‘rule, as defined in the

Wildcat Handbook, is this:
Davidson College is opposed
as a matter of principle to the
use of alcoholic beverages by
students. A student wilt ordin-
arily be suspended if he is
found guilty of drinking, pos-
sessing or being under the in-
fivence of an alcoholic bever-
age while within the town
limits of Davidson or while
attending any off-campus
event sponsored entirely or in

part by Davidson College.

“It is our interpretation,”
said Workman, “that a fraterni-
ty function is sponsored in part
by the college” and therefore
subject to the rule.

Johnny Rogers, who was pres-
ent at Wednesday’s meeting in
his advisory capacity as IFC
president, said that the problem
“is mainly one of communica-
tion. I think it will improve our
situation when the committee
members and the fraternities

Ensemble
“Old Time’

The Davidson College Wind Ensemble will present

a Nineteenth Century Band
March 15, at 8:15 p.m.

Sharing the conductor's spot-
light with Dr. Grier M. Williams,
Ensemble director, will be
James C. Harper, '15, of Lenoir.
While at Davidson Harper par-
ticipated actively in the music
program, directing the College
Orchestra during his last two
years.

After leaving Davidson, he
entered the business field before
going to Lenoir to direct the
American Legion Band there.

When this organization was
discontinued in 1924, he ac-
cepted a job as temporary
band director in the Lenoir
High School and remained in
this position until his retire-
ment in 1956. Under his lead-
ership, the Lenoir band won
first division ratings in state
competition for thirty-four
consecutive years.

Harper has played in all parts
of the U. S. and has directed
every major service band and
also the famous Goldman Band.
He is a past president of the
American Bandmasters Associa-
tion, the only high school direc-
tor to have held this position.

This pest summer he was
asked by Gov. Terry Sanford
to represent the state at the
Worlds Fair in Seattle. At the
present time he hold the posi-
tion of Director Emeritus of
the Lenoir band.

The program for the concert
will include “Der Freischutz”
by C. M. v. Weber, “A Pot
Pourri of 19th Century Airs”
arranged by Phillip Lang,
Gounod’s famous “Funeral
March of a Marionet,” “The Bar-
ber of Seville” by Rossini, and
Offenbach’s “Ballet Parisien.”

The committee will meet
again Monday to prepare its
views for presentation to the
fraternities.

Dean Asks Profs
About Holiday Cuts

The office of Dean of Students
is distributing a questionnaire
among faculty members to find
out how many students cut just
before and just after the.
Thanksgiving and Christmas
holidays.

Professors are being asked to
compare rate of absences under
the new absence regulations and
under those last year when a
double-cut was charged students
cutting a course the two days
before and the .two days after
a holiday. They are also invited
to offer their comments on im-
proving the system.

The survey grew out of a re-
quest from President D. Grier
Martin to document a statement
being prepared for the Trustees
that said cutting was not notice-
ably worse under the new sys-
tem than under the old.

“I have had sporadic informa-
tion from some professors that
the cutting was not as bad as
some had feared,” reported
Dean Richard C. Burts. “But
President Martin said we need-
ed concrete statistics.

“Our only purpose is to docu-
ment a feeling we’ve had. I
think the results aré going to
show we didn't havé a mass
exodus,” he smiled.
