SGA Senate readjusts parking fee

By SYDNEY J. HARRIS

In accordance with the addi-
tion to its procedural by-laws
passed last month, the SGA
Senate held its first annual
masquerade party Tuesday
night.

It was the first all-night
meeting of the year, but with
the generous supply of beer
and pretzels provided by Ron
Scott, no one seemed to mind.

The first item brought up
for consideration was a propo-
sal to establish parking fines
at $9.98.

Arguing in support of the
proposal, one of the senators,
dressed as Tonto (1) for the
evening, said, ‘‘I think the
$9.98 price is an ideal compro-
mise. In fact, it’s a bargain.”

But Humpty Dumpty (2)
responded with a half-hour
blast. “I fail to see the bargain
here. No one bargained with
the average student, the guy
who has to pay the fine.”’

He pounded his shell for
emphasis. ‘‘It’s obvious to me

that the administration would
like nothing better than for us
to pass this fine.”

Presiding at the meeting,
Mother Goose (3) heard six
motions for discussion to be
closed, but each was defeated.
Three hours later, the motion
was referred to committee.

The Senate then took up a
consideration of the water
fountains in the new Student
Union building.

According to Dumpty,
“Shaw Smith (Union Director)
has completely mismanaged
this whole business. You go
upstairs and the water from
the fountains is lukewarm,
almost hot; downstairs, and it
sends chills to your jawbone.

‘“‘What I especially resent is
how the Union Board was
never even consulted as to
what type of beverage the
fountains squirt, much less
the temperature of that beve-
rage.”

The Senate eventually
passed a resolution that ‘‘con
sideration should be given to

fountains are hereafter in-
stalled.’”” The vote was 17-0,
with one abstention.

The Tin Man (4) summed up
the resolution, ‘“This may not
be our most eloquent motion,
but it serves a purpose that is
precisely correct.”

The Comic Book Club then
submitted a request for $150
of the Senate’s speaker funds
in order to bring an alleged
“Clark Kent” to Davidson as a
lecturer.

The Chancellor of the Sen-
ate, dressed as Puck (5) for the
evening, reported current un-
spent Senate speaker funds to
be $627.14, but there was
nevertheless opposition to the
bill.

One of the senators, dressed
as the Jolly Green Giant (6),
argued that the integrity of
the budget has to be pre-
served.

“This request is ridiculous,
ridiculous. I don’t even think
the Senate has authority to
give funds to this organi-
zation.”

Puck raised his hand, but
before he could reply, Jolly
hastily corrected himself.
“Oh, sure it can. I keep
forgetting that the Senate can
do anything.”’

Dumpty pointed out, ‘“‘But I
don’t see why we need to

‘Clark Kent’ from the outside
when right here at D.C. we
have our own Zack Long.”’

The weight of his argument
carried the Senate. The vote
against the request was 17-0,
with one abstention.

The Senate also passed a
stupid resolution calling for
The Davidsonian to replace its
Senate reporter—clearly an
ill-reasoned, ill-timed move.
Rumor has it that no one is
taking it very seriously.

Later in the night, the
Senate passed bills calling for
the construction of two new
dorms, the abolition of Wed-
nesday classes, and the regi-
stration of Ron Scott in Dr.
Maloney’s new ‘‘Food and
Conscience’’ course (7).

A bill calling for an increase
in the number of Afghans
among the resident dog popu-
lation was defeated. Resolu-
tions calling for student
power, the survival of the
college, campus-wide fun and
frolics, and 100 percent liter-
acy were referred to commit-
tees.

day that all his dreams were
about to come true, as he had
just been accepted on the
Early Decision Plan to Bow-
man Gray Medical School.
Fredricksen has always en-
couraged his students by tell-
ing the story of the man who
has been trying to get into
medical school for twenty-
eight years, and who just

keeps on applying. Yesterday .

Fredricksen admitted that he
was that student.

“T always thought my GPA
was competitive,’’ said Fred-
ricksen, ‘‘but before medical
schools will even consider your
application they want you to
prove your true worth. This
year I gave myself a superb
recommendation.

“Visiting all of the medical
schools in this part of the
country and under the guise of
an ambassador from Davidson

College, gaining entrance to
the:Admissions Committee

meetings, then getting down

on my knees and pleading my
cause really impressed them, I
belieye,”’ said Fredricksen.

““Now I just have to keep up
a sincere and hard-working
front until the end of next
year, and I’1l finally have it
made,” Fredricksen exulted.
Fredricksen is the first David-
son College professor to enter
medical school, although Bio-
logy Professor Donald L.
Kimmel earned his M.D. be-
fore coming to teach at David-
son.

“I tried to give Jim my
M.D., since I really have no
use for it now,’ said Kimmel,
“but he really wants to go to
medical school—that is his
life’s goal, which he has been
living vicariously all these
years through his students.”’

Debate team

with some of our freshman
mouthers. They ought to be
good for at least another term
before they forget what they
learned about debate before
they came here and file them-
selves into their own note-
boxes.”

Despite the team’s winning
record, all is not sweetness
and light. Internal dissentions
on the team manifested them-
selves in what seems to have

been an attempt on Mrs.
Cornell’s life.

“I found a pack of Juicy-
Fruit Gum on her desk beside
a note asking her to walk
across campus to Dean Terry’s
office,’’ said team member
Sam Crawford. ‘‘I removed
the gum immediately. I just
couldn’t imagine Davidson de-
bate without Coach Cornell.”

“I think that debate is a
good experience for every’stu-
dent,”’ said Mrs. Cornell.
