Spratt speaks about Bush’s tax plan SGA fires

BY BRENT BYARS

Representative John Spratt (D- SC) grew
up in politics, handing out fliers and learning
to heckle his political oppo-
nents at an early age. Spratt
credits his father with intro-
ducing him to politics, but
who was never “lucky
enough” to achieve political
office. Spratt graduated from
Davidson 37 years ago, and
calls his stint as Student Gov-
ernment Association Presi-
dent a formative experience.
In addition to being a
Davidson College Trustee,
Spratt is a tenth term Con-
gressman from South Caro-
lina, and the ranking Demo-
crat on the Budget Commit-
tee.

After a Trustee meeting
Friday, the representative .
took the time to speak to the assembled mem-
bers of the Pre-Law society about.the.path.to
public service and elective office. After his

talk, those in the audience fant on the chance
to ask Spratt about US President Bush’s pro-
posals on taxes, national missile defense and
‘race relations in America, which (like Presi-
dent Bush) the southern Democrat pronounces

Local businesses victims

The once sleepy town of Davidson has
recently been wrought with signs of crime.
Well, crime of signs, anyway.

Early last week, Ben and Jerry’s ice cream
shop reported the theft of its outdoor, wall-
mounted sign. Around the same time, em-
ployees at neighboring store Summit Coffee
noticed their freestanding sidewalk sign had
disappeared. A mystery quickly emerged

. surrounding these suspicious occurrences.

The big scoop was to be had at Ben and
Jerry’s. Upon finding the sign missing last
week, storeowners immediately notified town
police, who in turn informed college campus
police of the robbery of this cumbersome
piece of store property.

“You'd have to use a power tool to get the
darn thing off the wall,” reflected Karen
Toney, store manager at the ice cream shop.
“Or at least a crow bar.” The oval shaped
sign, which featured the name “Ben and
Jerry’s” above a hand holding an ice cream

David Beam of Summit was first to ob-

_serve that the coffee shop’s sign had disap-

peared. ‘Stolen’ in this case might be a bit of

week,” Beam recalled. “We’re not sure how
or why or when exactly.”

College. Communications

Rep. Spratt (D-SC) spoke at Davidson on Friday.

sent his tax cut proposal to Congress, citing

the concerns of a slowing economy. Spratt’s

position on the Budget Committee and his

knowledge of the minutiae of finance policy

are important assets in the coming’ partisan
struggle. Spratt opposes
President Bush’s proposal,
but his opposition is not only
party-driven. Instead, Spratt
brings a wealth of detail-
oriented knowledge to the
argument.

In response to questions
from students and faculty,
Spratt emphasized that
President Bush’s cut would
disproportionately favor the
more affluent because the
only cuts are in the lowest
(15%) tax bracket and rela-
tively few of these individu-

.als are currently paying
taxes. The only other tax
cut, Spratt said, was in the
highest tax bracket (39.6%),

where it would only affect the very affluent.

Although the robbery does not directly
concern Davidson College, campus police
sergeants have been instructed to keep an eye
peeled. “We work at maintaining a line of
communication about any activity that could
have acommunity impact,” commented Sam
McKelvey, Director of Public Safety & Po-

abouts before filing any reports with local
authorities.
Those at Ben and Jerry’s, however, are

- pretty confident that their twenty-pound, bolt-

fastened sign did not just randomly misplace
itself. Covering the recently exposed bleached
spot on the storefront with a new sign will
cost upwards of $600.

“I can’t understand who would want to
steal such a thing,” pondered Toney. The
store manager does not want to point any

- fingers, but expresses her fear thaf the sign

might currently be “gracing someone’s dorm

However, in the hope of retrieving her
property, Toney has offered not to press
charges in exchange for the sign’s safe return.
In fact, she has even arranged a reward.
“Anyone who finds the sign and returns it,”

promised the store manager, “will receive .

“Where there’s a hamburger, there’s com-
munity, and that’s what Davidson is all about,”
Dave Mabe, ’04. The Student Government
Association passed a resolution to have grilts,
similar to those at the senior apartments, in
front of various dorms, including the sopho-
more apartnients.

Class of 2003 Senator Kevin Epps and
SGA President Joey Harris ‘02 co-sponsored
the resolution. The proposal itself was passed
in Dane Erickson’s ‘01 last meeting as SGA
President. The idea began because of the
extensive use of outdoor grills behind the
senior apartments, Epps said. The resolution
stressed that the new influx of grills placed
near picnic tables would help bring about
time spent as acommunity. “Davidson needs
more places where people can have cookouts
and the sophomore apartments would be a
great location for more,” Jordan Gratrix, ’04,
said. When President Vagt was asked about
the idea, he agreed with Epps that this resolu-
tion was a good idea in the process of commu-
njty building, which may culminate with the
implication of a community hour.

Despite the administration’ s and the SGA’s
enthusiasm forthe resolution (the vote passed
with no rejections and only two abstentions),
there are some reservations. RLO has posed
