Survival And The Fraternities

Reporters can sense good news
copy when they see it. This usually
leads to a certain amount of bias in
interpreting the facts. We strongly
suspect that this is partially the case
with the recent Look Magazine article
on fraternities. It is undoubtedly more
a study of the situation in the large
university than the small private col-
lege.
6 Yet we should not ignore the fun-
damental facts and issues which con-
front every fraternity and_non-fra-
ternity man in this article. The very
fact that the question of the survival
of fraternities has been raised in not
one, but several national magazines is
important in itself. The influence of
the articles, even if the conclusions
are false, will be extensive.

“The fraternity system holds a
key position in Davidson life.” This is
the opening statement in the frater-
nity section of the Wildcat Handbook.
Now one would question it. Aside
from the physical fact of a college-
built court, this position can be seen
every day by the fraternities’ relation-
ship to the college rules. Any rule,
such as the drinking rule, which ap-
plies to the individual student also
applies to the fraternity: There is a
closeness here that is unique. ;

But rules, especially the drinking
rule, point up a basic weakness in our
“key position.” The system, in its
external relations, has tended to
change itself only by reaction. Frater-
nities have let their arteries harden
and have been prompted to move only
when a potential threat to life or lim
presents itself. This was the case with
sophomore rush and this is partially
the case with the “newly awakened”
drinking rule. The weakness of reac-
tion as a dominent mode of behavior
is clearly implicit throughout the
Look article.

We need only look around to see
that this weakness might turn into our
Achilles heel. Fraternities at Furman
and Charlotte College are either dead
or dying. ;

The existential question must be
asked repeatedly. “How can I justify
my existence?” The Charlotte College
furor prompted us to wheel out some
of our best public relations fodder.

Davidson fraternities were extolled
on the grounds that they were active
service organizations and were real
centers of brotherhood (although not
because of the drinking rule).

The first “virtue” is relatively a
minor one and didn’t deserve the em-

hasis put on it in letters to The Cher-
lotte Observer. Only sheer imagina-
tion could turn a-week-and-a-day of
service (This is all for most fraterni-
ties.) into a year-round virtue. We
suggest, however, that if fraternities
are really serious about this function,
they establish monthly work projects
individually or through the IFC. The
number of such projects that could
be carried out are endless.
“Davidson is unique in that most
fraternities probably do have that ab-
stract value of brotherhood. This
whole concept is being attacked
though, on the grounds of discrimina-
tory membership restrictions. These
attacks find justification in that it is
a national organization restrictin
membership rather than the loca
chapter. Thus a national policy works
to the detriment of the local chapter. A
policy of this kind prevents the local
chapter from having real freedom of
choice. It is rather ironic that centur-
ies after the early Christian Church
decided to accept all gentiles that now
the gentiles in supposedly Christian
brotherhoods seek to exclude Jews
and Negroes.

‘ As a fraternity system that seeks
to survive, we cannot ignore these
waves of change till they lap at our
doorstep. Pressure for more local
autonomy must begin now.

“Time has run out for the nation-
al fraternity system. It has failed to
adapt itself to the demands of the new
student and to a changing social pat-
tern.” This is the statement of a col-
lege president in an address given to
a convention of State University Presi-
dents. We hope this is not the final
word. ’
But the time for simple reaction
is gone. A re-evaluation of the founda-
tions of fraternities should begin now.

Let’s not wait for these waves of
change to assault us. We may discover
that our house is built on sand.

Controversy With A Goal

A new awareness is gripping the
campus in. America. The student, at
least the one who cares, is beginning
to confront the political and social
issues of our times.

This is reflected in the South,
an area long known for its adept,
even if backward, politicians. The sit-
in movement, the Republican resurg-
ence, and the corresponding Demo-
cratic activity; all have their origins
in interested youth. _

Colleges are discovering that
students will turn out en masse to
hear speakers ranging from Gus Hall
to Malcolm X. At Davidson too, ex-
perience has shown that speakers
creating the most interest were those,
like Fulton Lewis, Jr. and Leon Uris,
who dealt with contemporary social
and political problems. And it is in
this area where there is a real lacking
at Davidson.

Students here are exposed to an
amazing amount of diverse Christian
thought. This should not be changed.
But there is an amazing amount of
ignorance about some widely debated
political and social stances. This
was painfully apparent last year when
Fulton Lewis, Jr. came and presented
his defense of the House on Un-Ameri-
can Activities Committee. The turn-
out was tremendous but it was clear
that few students had prior know-
ledge of the committee and the con-
troversy surrounding it.

Of course, any of the religious

speakers we have can outline a con-

troversial stance, but after awhile we
get the feeling that we're just being
told what our attitude should be to-
ward wi-at others are doing. We want
to confront these ideas in their most
dramatic form, from their strongest
advocates. We should give the intel-
ligent communist spokesman the same
hearing as the intelligent spokesman
about communism. Both are valuable.

We realize that the Student Coun-
cil, the Conservative Club, and the
International Relations Club, among
others, are continually trying to get
committed spokesmen of this kind.
But this is pretty hard with a shoe-
string budget.

We would propose a Great Issues
Committee be formed. It would be
composed of both students and faculty
members and would have a budget
available if necessary. Its purpose
would be different from the Reynolds
Lecture series in that it would tend to
focus the emphasis on one or more
related issues. This could be done by
getting various speakers throughout
the year or concentrating efforts on
one weekend symposium such as was
recently done at Randolph-Macon
Woman's College.

The value of such a continuing
program would be incalculable. If
nothing else it would prepare us for an
active political role in the community
of tomorrow.

We are sure the basic interest al-
ready exists.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Hallmark Hits Omission
Of Vags’ Play Review

Hallmark

Dear Editor:

You slipped when you failed
to include a review of the Vaga-
bonds’ last production. Mrs.
Louise Hampton's production of
Elmer Rice's “The Adding Ma-
chine” deserved mention. A
short letter to the editor cannot
adequately discuss the merits
of the production and of the
play’s theme, but I, as self-ap-
pointed reviewer, submit a bare
outline.

The physical aspects of the
production—tighting, sets, sty-
lized stage action, and musical
score—were superb. The acting
was generally good. Mrs. Zero
perhaps lacked ‘enough acidity;
Mr. Zero could have known his
lines better; Miss Devore was
convincing; Shrdlu was delight-
ful; Lt. Charles seemed to take
himself too seriously.

To analyze the theme of the
play is beyond the scope both
of this review and of this re-
viewer, but I want to give my
impressions. The most striking
aspect of the play was, for m-,
the type of society presented.
Bourgeois is an over-worked ad-
jective; to say that these people
lack imagination is more speci-
fic. Any imaginative powers
they have are crude, molded by
Poor quality mass media (senti-
mental movies, sensational news-
papers), fenced in by convention,
Prejudice, respectablility, 9 1-
tered to routine in everything.

These characteristics are il-
lustrated beautifully in the third
scene when an after-dinner con-
versation passes slowly through
gossip and dirty jokes, acceler-
Gare

ates into racism, and climaxes
in a burst of ideal-less pseudo-
patriotism, when everyone
stands, hand over heart, for a
chorus of “America.” The wara-
ing strikes home to all of us
who ever feel in the least that
we betray our individual minds
and spirits by thoughtlessly con-
forming to established attitudes
and by living unexamined and
undirected lives.

Dear Editor:

The selfish motive in freedom
of which Dr. Stumpf spoke in
last Sunday's vesper service was
amply demonstrated by the very
persons with whom he was try-
ing to share his ideas. I am re-
ferring to the outburst of cough-
ing that occurred when certain
people realized that the address
would violate the somehow
sacred hour of 8:30 p.m. To m2,
this incident indicates the ser-
iousness of, and points out at
least three different aspects of,
the whole question of compul-

yrv vespers and chapel.

Lrt it be understood from the
beginning that I consider the
practice of coughing, as it were,
in a speaker's face, to indicate
one's displeasure to be the most
childish discourtesy with which
any audience could offend its
speaker. I hope the partles in-
volved heard enough of Dr.
Stumpf's sermon to realize now
that their action was both dis-
respectful of the speaker and
that it revealed a selfish, or at
least a thoughtless, attitude to-
ward their fellow students. Two

Strawberries

BY TOM WRIGHT
Fitm Committee Chairman

Four years ago Swedish Director
made his 18th and best film,

Inmar Bergman
WILD STRAWBERRIES.

Concentrating on a single day, he portrays the entire life

of an individual.
The central figure,

an

80-year-old doctor, awakes

on the day he is to receive an important degree from his

university — the climax of his life’s work, the token of
its significance. Yet this day (and the movie) begins with
a fantastic film in which his own corpse tries to drag him
into a crypt. This weakens his self-satisfaction and starts
a series of events that question the value of his achieve-
ments.

Partially responsible for the success of this story
and its character is Victor Seastom, who plays the doctor.
Seastrom was a great Hollywood director of the ’20’s and,
as evidenced by his portrait of the physician, remains an
excellent actor. Elsewhere Bergman's dominance is evi-
dent. The picture is typically painted with symbols. For
example, the doctor, visiting a summer house where he
picked Strawberries with a girl he loved, encounters

itchikers that represent seven aspects of modern life

(shades of LA DOLCE VITA).

Certainly the film is visually beautiful and emotion-
ally sensitive. Yet the strength of WILD STRAWBERRIES
lies in Bergman’s avoidance of his weaknesses that have
become as typical as his acclaimed strengths. The story
is interesting and effectively presented by the director
without relying on the theatrical convention of the script
to underline and overemphasize what should be visually
clear to the audience.

Next week: THE VIKINGS with Kirk Douglas, Tony
Curtis, and Panet Leigh.

of my three aspects of the gen-
eral problem of compulsory
vespers and chapel are concern-
ed with this selfish attitude of
what I hope is a small minority
of the student body.

Let us call the discourtesy to-
ward the speaker the first as-
pect. The reality of this aspect
will be obvious to everyone, in-
cluding the offenders, after a
moment or two of personal re-
flection free of the influence
of spontaneous group action.

T ask you to imagine yourself
addressing a college audience.
Suppose you had something to
say that you felt very sincerely,
and you wanted to share this
idea with the possibility of help-
ing someone clarify his own
thoughts. You have emphasized
the main points of your address
and are preparing to polish it
off with a meaningful conclusion
when suddenly there erupts
from the audience a rash of
coughing, obviously directed at
you, which almost drowns out
your voice. How do you think
you would feel being repaid in
this manner after having set out
with the motives mentioned
above?

The second aspect concerns
the selfish or thoughtless atti-
tude toward fellow students.
Have you coughers ever thought
that someone might be trying to
listen to the speaker. If my
hopes are true, most of the stud-
ents are interested in listening
or at least are not interested in
keeping others from listening.
Think of the other fellow when
you are tempted to jeer, wheth-
er by coughing or otherwise.

However much I feel disinelin-
ed at the moment to mention the
third aspect, I cannot deny that
there is that side to the issue,
too. Some of the vespers and
chapel speakers do leave some-
thing to be desired, and proba-
bly the coughers are occasion-
ally justified in their displeas-
ure. But the minimum courteous
and unselfish attitude to take
in such a situation would be to
sit quietly and sleep throughout
the ordeal without whispering,
joking, coughing, and what not,
thereby disturbing both the
spcaker and the other students.

In conclusion, I would like to
reemphasize the often neglected
second aspect, I feel that the
interests of the student who
tries to participate in the ves-
pers service are overlooked both
by the “coughers” and by the
administration. If the purpose
of compulsory vespers and
chapel is to enrich the students’
religious life, it fails miserably.
I have seldom experienced a
vespers service in which I have
not been disturbed and often of-
fended by the conduct of disin-
terested students.

For this reason alone — that
compulsory vespers and chapel
destroy the atmosphere neces-
sary for true worship—I am in
favor of a substitute system.
The system has been suggested
of requiring a certain number

of attendances at assemblies, '

chapels, vespers, or musical and
dramatic productions, and allow-
ing the student to concentrate
in the field of his own interest,
perhaps with some minimum re-
quiremertts in certain fields. I
feel that this would. be: the ideal
situation.

BY WALTER MACDONALD

“Wwe aim to develop: the fur-
nished mind, a mind equipped
with a broad knowledge of the
world we live in, the cultured
heritage we possess, and the
nature of man in society; the
inquiring mind, never satisfied
with its own achievements,
eager to learn, equipped with
tools and methods used in the
further search for truth, the
free mind, bold, not. timid, in-
vestigating rather than accept-
ing: the creative mind, always
seeking new truth and new com-
mitments to free man for the
future as well as from the past;
the social mind, thinking in
terms of all mankind, using its
own powers for the benefit of
society as a whole.” (Dr. Frontis
W. Johnston, Dean of Faculty,
1960)

Today, the Davidson student
is faced with a curriculum that
is characterized by too much of
too little. Fifty-eight hours are
divided between Bible, English,
history, mathematics, ROTC, a
foreign language, and a natural
science, dramatics, economics,
fine arts, music, political
science, philosophy, psychology
and sociology remain untouched
by the core requirements which
seek to produce the “whole”
man. A reduction in the number
of required Bible courses or a
combination of existing ones
would allow some of the social
sciences to be inserted into the
core requirements. If this were
done, the student would be ex-
posed to a comprehensive area
before delving into the specializ-
ed intricacies of any particular

subject.

The faculty has shown that
it is eware that constant
examination of the curriculum
ls the key to progress. As a
result of its recent action,
qualified freshmen of the class
of 67 will be given advanced
standing and full college cred-

it on certein courses. The
problem of hypheneted cours-
es limiting selection of elec-
tives hes also been solved. By
dropping the hyphen, one
semester courses were creat-
ed. The integrated courses
in the humanities is doing e
good job in showing students
the interrelationship between
economics, fine arts, history,
literature, philosophy, politics,
and religion from the ancient
to the modern world. These
Innovations are commendable,
but more must be made if the
curriculum’s goal is to be at-
tained.

Davidson's program of depart-
mental honors allows students of
exceptional ability to substitute
special work for a part of the
normal course requirements.
This supervised work on an in-
dividual or small group basis en-
ables students to progress to
ward an understanding of their

major field at an accelerated

pace. Honors are offered in the
English, French, history, and
Latin departments. Approxi-
mately one per cent of the stud-
ent body is enrolled in this pro-
gram.

Ideally, in every department
where it is feasible, departmen-
tal honors should be increased.
Before this could be done, two
problems would have to be
solved. Honors are taught by
faculty members in addition to
their regular work. This puts a
strain on them; so if the honors
program is expanded, more pro-
fessors will have to be hired
and this would be expensive.
The library also poses a prob-
lem in that it is inadequate for
a large-scale honors program.
One possible remedy of this
problem could be the introduc-
tion of more seminar courses to
challenge the gifted student.

To fill in geps in the cur-
riculum, a reading program
should be introduced similer
to the one presented in the
1963 Dertmouth College Bul-
letin: “A program of inde-
pendent reading, unrelated to
particular courses and under
the direction of a special fac-
uity committee, will be re-
quired of every student in
each of the four years. The
student will select books from
prepared bibliographies and
will be held responsible for
this reading. He may do the
reading during the ecedemic
year, but will be encouraged
to use vacation periods as well
for this purpose. During the
first two years the required
reading will consist of books
of general interest with which
a well-educated man should be
familier. During the last two
yeers, outside reading will
be supervised by the faculty
of the student’s major depart-
ment.” The reedings, of
course, would be geared to the
needs of the individuel stud-
ent.

The program which Dart-
mouth calls the “Senior Fellow-
ship” and Yale ‘The Scholar of
the House” should be introduc-
ed into the present curriculum.
A faculty committee would
sélect up to five men from the
applications of qualified seniors
to participate in this program.
These students should be given
complete academic freedom to
spend their entire senior year
on their own, excused from all
requirements, including chapel
and vespers. They should be al-
lowed to discover their intellec-
tual capacity and the real intel-
lectual process in an independ-
ent research project with what-
ever faculty supervision neces-
sary. This program has no mid-
dle-of-the-roaders; it is either
successful or it fails. But it does
produce the whole man.
