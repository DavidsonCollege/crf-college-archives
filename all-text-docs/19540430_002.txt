Chapel Conduct Shows No Lack of Culture;
Sounds Knell To Basic Student Integrity

It has been rightly said that power in-
volves responsibility. There can be little
wonder, then, that the student feels him-
self so powerless in these trying days
when his student government seems to be
falling apart, for he certainly seems to
show himself incapable of taking on even
a faint tinge of adult responsibility.

The latest case of this ruination so far
as self-dependence is concerned has been
shown in chapel this week. Indeed, the
Davidson student, noted for his childish
conduct in chapel, merely added another
filthy page to the long story.

Whistling, coughing, sleeping: none of
these have a place in the chapel exercise,
yet all three have common approval in
our present generation of Davidson
gentlemen. Any argument that compul-
sion involves the right to show disrespect
for people trying to cooperate with it is

absurd. Respect for the personality trying
to lead the service, no matter how bad the
sound system or the message may be,
should be a fundamental trait of any de-
cent person, and no argument against the
compulsion, sorry leadership, or curbing
of student rights can leave out this funda-
mental principle. The student expects
respect for himself at the hands of those
to whom he is subject. Might it not be
expected of him to show like respect?

One feels almost compelled to agree
with the well remembered columnist of
a year ago who threw up his hands in
shame, calling the Davidson students
“rubes, boobs, and country bumpkins.”
We must disagree, and propose that the
students are yet steeped in culture, but
have failed to learn how to live away from
mother.

Football Grant Lacks Kick Necessary
To Put Davidson On Top Of Heap

Recently the editorial columns burned
with praises or curses for the $30,000
given to football for the coming year.
Speculation soared as to whether or not
Davidson would top the Southern Confer-
ence in football next year. No one doubted
that with the subsidy the Davidson foot-
ball squad would hit the field next year
with a better chance of playing winning
ball.

From the standpoint of one interested
in having respectable collegiate sports at
Davidson the football grant is a real boon
to the school. Football, thought of widely
in college circles as the sport that makes
or breaks athletic prowess, might now
gain its rightful place as an added power-
house to a school already tingling with
scholastic energy.

But the recent trustee grant does not
answer the football problem in its en-
tirety. The facts stand that even thirty
thousand dollars is a puny bit when com-
pared to the gigantic sums spent in other

Jara Carolina schools for pigskin
prowess each year. We do not attempt to
discuss the purely academic question of
whether athletics should be subsidized at
all or not. Our contention is that if David-

son is to subsidize at all she have faith
enough in the move she makes to go all
the way with it; that if she once touches
her hand to the plow she be unafraid to
go to the end of the row.

The present collegiate athletic out-
look shows football to be the most highly
subsidized sport. The contention of this
editorial is that the present subsidy, if
subsidy of itself be considered proper, is
not enough to produce a top notch foot-
ball team, and that as such it is more of
a waste of money than popular opinion
realizes. A team able to meet medicore
teams half-way and good teams not at all is
wasting subsidy money. A team able to
stand up to the best is a team whose sub-
sidy pays off in a college reputation and
gate receipts.

If Davidson is to jump on the band-
wagon of football subsidy let her do it in a
big way. The moral issue is not on the
block here; rather the economic issue. To
the sensible motorist a car of more cost
and more service is more economical than
the cheap car whose motor, tires and life
fly by night. Perhaps Davidson could
learn from the motorist.

Hell Week Parley Example Of
Needed Student-Faculty Interdependence

A recent meeting of the faculty com-
mittee on fraternities with leaders and
brothers of the several fraternities showed
real need for rethinking of the hell week
situation in the eleven groups. More im-
portant, however, the meeting showed
both a willingness on the part of the
faculty to cooperate with constructive
student action, and a method of going
about this cooperation.

It was made clear at the beginning of
the meeting that no shade can be drawn
over the growing distrust between the
faculty and the students in the past two
years. Both students and faculty at the
meeting felt that the only way to make
the most of Davidson’s potentialities
would be the way of cooperation.

In pure open meeting fashion the com-
plaints of the administration against hell
week were presented. Going to sleep in
class on the part of tired pledges was
described as an unfairness to them as well
as to the professors. Processes of public
humiliation, eating of indigestible foods,
etc., were seen as useless and detrimental
to an otherwise good system.

Students in the meeting pointed out
that the duration and vigor of this year’s
hell weeks might have been due to the
facts that freshmen were not well ac-
quainted- with the brothers beforehand
and had to get to know them better, or
that most of hell week was “right here in
Davidson.’

Greek Week, that is the death of it,
was discussed at some length. The stu-
dents pointed out that Greek or Help
Week has turned into an individual af-
fair with the fraternities, and that so far
as its connection with the IFC is con-
cerned, it might just as well go by the
board.

The recent meeting could serve as
a door to greater cooperation, much
needed cooperation, between the students
and the faculty.It should be clear to the
students that the faculty has no boiling
cauldron of hateful tortures for the under-
graduates. In the student situation the
best way to succeed is to succeed by de-
liberation and sensible consultation such
as took place at the meeting. Instead of
thoughtlessly going into a panic at the
first scent of slave-driving paternalism,
the student by such constructive thought
might well prove himself adult enough to
be depended upon to make his actions
count for the good of all concerned with
him.

As to the direct problem of hell week,
abolition would be out of the question.
Moderation, however, and a renewed em-
phasis on the constructive parts of the
week are musts. An intensification of the
whole pledge program would go a lot
further toward producing friendship and
cooperation within a fraternity than would
any last-minute spurt of sadistic torture
by some small portion of the group.

Dulles Faces Knotty

Problem

at Geneva

By DICK ROPER

In the next few weeks the eyes
of all who have any interest in the
course of the free world’s struggle
against Communist imperialism
will be focused on the peaceful
Swiss city of Goneva, and it is not
overstating the case to say that
the discussions and the decisions
made there could easily have a
very immediate effect on the lives
of all of us.

Realizing this, we should try to
appreciate the magnitude of the
task which Secretary of State
Dulles has undertaken at the
Geneva conferences. For at Geneva

*Dulles and the American delega-

tion must inevitably find them-
selves confronted with not only
the opposition of the Russians and
the Chinese and Indochinese Com-
munists, but also with one of our
own Western Allies.

The principal topics of discus
sion at Geneva will be of course
the problem of Korean unification
and a settlement of the Indochinese
war. In the case of Korea we will
be dealing with an enemy which
is not only unlikely to agree to
our opinion of how that country
is to be unified, but will un-
doubtedly press very hard for the
acceptance of their own formula.
It is only being realistic to assert
that little agreement can be ex-
pected on Korea unless the West
makes concessions which it can-
not honorably make.

Problem Extremely
Complex

But if Korea is a thorny prob-
lem, the Indochinese situation is
an even greater one because of
its complexity. For Secretary
Dulles here must deal not only
with the Communist aggressors but
with the hard-pressed French who
are anxious, almost desperate, to
end the war which has been a
terrific drain on both their finan-
cial and manpower resources for
seven years.

The United States has already
taken the position that the preser-

Student Council
Scored For Delay

Dear Editor:

It has been brought to my atten.
tion that three weeks have elapsed,
and nothing has been done con-
cerning the proposed amendments,
which were presented to the Da-
vidson Student Council April 9. I
would simply like to ask the ques-
tion, why has there been such a
evreat delay, not only in present-
ing the material to the student
body, but also even in the Student
Council’s meeting to discuss the
amendments. In all these three
weeks, they have me? only twice.

Since there has been such a tre-
mendous delay, what would be
done if a case similar to the pre-
vious one should come up, and
students refused to testify? It has
been said by leaders on the Student
Council that such a student would
be suspended for not testifying.

They ere planning te do this
even though they de not have
the authority: the Constitution
gives them no such power.

The current plans are that the
proposed amendments will be read
in Chapel on May 7, and ten days
later the students will. vote. This
would put the vote just two or
three days before exams, which is
entirely too late.

I urge the student body to in-
sist ote faster action by the student

Letter to Editor:

vation of Indochina from Commu-
nist domination is vital to the
security of the free world. The
British and French, however,
seem to take the position that
while the loss of Indochina to the
Communists would be unfortunate,
that area is not so important as to
provoke another world war just to
defend it.

Further Complications Seen

But even if the three Westérn
Allies, failing as they surely will
to gain a safe and honorable truce
in Indochina, can agree that Ameri-
can and British troops should be
sent in to aid the beleaguered
French, our problem will not be
solved.

For the French, weak as they
now are, are still extremely
adamant to renounce their colonial
privileges in Indochina. They stilt
have rather extensive colonial hold-
ings all over the globe, and the
loss of even a part of their hold-
ings would, they seem to feel, deal
a harsh blow to their position as
a world power, especially when
that position is as precarious as it
is now.

But we know that the French are
now ready to seek a truce in
Indochina at almost any price—
even, apparently, if it means giv-
ing up control over the three as-
sociated states of that country.
The advantages of having Indo-
china in their colonial system are
rapidly becoming outweighed, it
appears, by the - great drain on
French strength which the war
there is.

Dulles’ Real Problem

In the light of these factors, Sec.
retary Dulles’ real problem thus
becomes obvious. For if the French
cannot retain Indochina as a
colony or at least keep special
privileges there, they certainly will
not be prepared to continue the
long and bitter struggle to keep
it out of the Communist orbit.

The United States, on the other
hand, certainly cannot afford to go
to war to preserve the colonial
privileges of another major power.
Nothing would give the Commu-
nists more fuel for propaganda
than such a move. And few other
moves would be more unpopular
with the American people whose
fighting men would be bearing the
brunt of the defense within short
order should they be sent into

“Indochina, than for these men to

be defending French imperialism.
What Secretary Dulles must first
attempt to do at Geneva on the
Indochina war therefore, is to at-
-tempt to work out, along with the
British and French, a. suitable
settlement with the Communists
on the war there. It is not being
pessimistic to say that he literally
has not even a ghost of a chance
to do this, since the Communists
have nothing to gain and every-
thing to lose on a truce which
would preserve Indochina from
Communist domination.

Must Persuade French

Failure of the Western Allies to
negotiate an honorable peace in
Indochina, then, means that Sec-
Tetary Dulles will have the equally
difficult but vitally important task
of persuading the French first,
to continue the fight against Ho.
Chi Minh’s Chinese-supported
Vietminh rebels; and secondly,
to repudiate their position of
a colonial power in  Indo-
china, perhaps keeping only a few
special privileges with the three
associated states getting virtual in-
dependence. .

With such a doubly difficult task
confronting him, Secretary Dulles’s

UNION RAKED OVER COALS
IN SAVAGE DENUNCIATION

Dear Faditor:

Sweltering through the expiring
heat of Davidson spring days is
enough for a student to bear. But
when he ascends to the second
floor of the College Union to set
about his daily work he must im:
mediately begin a process of strip-
ping. down to the point of im-
propriety before he can live in the
suffocating steaminess.

We do not mean to imply that
students are not used to heat.
Everyone at Davidson is its best
friend in the winter and an amiable
companion even in the summer.
Hot air is expected also in chapel.
It is not the heat that we com-
plain about. It is the fire hazard
brought about by the necessity of
wearing clothes in the College
Oven. Students are forced either
to strip bare and apply asbestos to

bare backs and bodies or to soak
their clothes Well in ice water
before taking the resultant turkish
bath in the Green Boiler or Blue
Boiler. It is as if the Presbyterian
Vatican has now been made com-
plete with a junior-sized purgatory.

There are too many complaints
in Davidson. But one more won't
hurt. Threatened with heat pros-
tration or an even more violent
evaporation, body and soul, the
student must ACT now before he
steams skyward with the breeze.

Why in the world was the Union
not given an air conditioning sys-
tem along with its records, books,
games and I don’t know what all?
It would have been but a mere
twenty thousand or so.

Gaspingly,
T.D.8.

Gragg Challenges Students With
New Spirit of Humble Optimism

(Editor’s note: Mr. Gragg
here presents a stream-of-
consciousness editorial masked
in the short story form. Using
clever satire and appealing
description, he nevertheless
has something worthwhile to
say as he traces a morning
from awakening to the chapel
siesta.)

The shrill sound of the alarm
clock stunned me into conscious-
ness Monday morning after the
memorable Spring Frolics weekend
had past into history. I was sleepier
than usual, but the sun rays were
beaming through the window and
beckoning invitingly to come out-
side and begin enjoying the ex-
periences which the beautiful day
held in store.

As 1 walked to breakfast with
the sweet yellow air of the April
morning blowing casually against
my face, the luxurious blades of
green grass rustling softly beneath
my feet, and the crystal blue sky
over my head, I felt a deep sense
of gratitude to God for the joy
of being alive on such a day.

Sitting down to breakfast, I
greeted another student with a
heartfelt, “Good morning, isn't it
a lovely day?”

His retort was quick and sarcas- .

tic: “What’s good about it? I'm
about to- drop from not getting
any sleep Friday and Saturday,
have two reviews tomorrow, a con-
founded lab this afternoon, and am
stuck in this confounded hole—
and you say it is a good morning!”

I knew that he was sleepy and
all that but still was provoked at
his attitude. After all, hadn't he
stayed out of his own accord both
nights of the weekend? I wondered
if he really had wanted to since
it so obviously had left him ex-
hausted, or whether he was just
conforming to the well-established
tradition that it is a disgrace to
bring your date in before 5 a.m.

anyway.

I didn't mind if he wanted to
stay up two full nights and thought
it was fine if he really was happy
doing it, but I did object to his
earrying a sullen disposition
throughout the week with him as
a result and taking it out on
everyone else. For some reason
the statement Templeton made in
his last address about “too many
people are mistaking a good time
for happiness” came to my mind,
and I wondered if this were true
in his case, since obviously the
weekend didn’t -seem to have
brought him lasting happiness!

But before I had a chance to.

comment further he was joined by
another perennial complainer who
was also indulging in an advanced
case of self-pity about his general
place in life and seeming to curse
fate for it. Together they had a
field day going over their favorite
list of complains—chapel, vespers,
cut system, strict rules of con-
duct, etc. Finally I could stand it
no longer and left without finish-
ing my meal.

1 walked outdoors again and
immediately got back again the
feeling of peace which I had lost
at breakfast. Just what was good

about the mornmmg after all? 1
wondered if he knew how many
boys would give almost anything
for the opportunity “to be stuck
in this confounded hole” but to
whom life had not given so many
material blessings. Did he have
anything to be thankful for to
make the morning seem good?

I thought of the persons espe-
cially in Asia suffering from a
lack of the necessities of life and
of how we Christians could pay
seven thousand dollars for a dance
band and yet can raise only one-
half this much for the Gift Fund.

I wondered if he knew how many.

persons were suffering from all
sorts of diseases that he was
spared. I thought of the hundreds
of boys his age who might soon
be on their way to die in a lone-
some vally in far off Indo-China.
Did he have anything to be thank-
ful for in being at Davidson? I
began to wonder...

To the Post Office

Just then as I was walking to
the post office admiring the un-
forgettable picture of the church
steeple against the clouds, I saw
some janitors carrying the benches
which the college had allowed the
students to use for the outdoor
concert Saturday. I marvelled at
this endurance of the administra-
tion after the riots, chapel con-
duct, and all the adverse student
criticism of the college and this
evidence of their policy of
“. . . returning good for evil.”

When I got back to the room the
janitor was struggling to carry out
the extra beds that the college
had furnished for the girls. I
thought of how fortunate we were
to have such excellent janitor
service and how undeserving of
this luxury we were .. . even Har-
vard had recently done away with
janitors in favor of encouraging
students to do more for themselves.

Suddenly my mind began to
think of other things for which to
be thankful for the opportunity of
being in “this confounded hole”
for four years. In addition to the
chance for social and athletic de-
velopment, the college possesses
such high academic standards,
which we so often joke about but
of which we are very proud and
will mean more to us in years to
come. I thought of the high intel-
lectual calibre of the students—
nine Rhodes Scholarships through
the years, numerous Fellowships
won each year by the seniors, etc.
Then I thought of the notable
record made by the faculty and
and administration recently—four
Ford Fellowships awarded to
faculty members in the past two
yeara, and of the honor bestowed
upon our president by, the Asso-
elation of American Colleges and
Universities in selecting him to
head it.

I thought of the outstanding
record made by numerous grad-
uates in the past in many fields
other than Woodrow Wilson (Dean
Rusk, chairman of the -Ford
Foundation; Dr. Joseph McConnell,
president of Colgate-Palmolive-
Peet Co., Dr. Frank Price, mod-

erator of the Southern Presbyterian
Church, etc.). I wished all at once
that I could look “into the seeds
of time” and see the recognition
Hfe would bring to many present
students in their chosen fields.
Yes, there was a lot to be thankful
for in the outstanding name and
record of our college.

As I heard the bell for the first
period ringing I walked slowly
across the campus and enjoyed
seeing many of the students. Then
I realized as never before the real-
ly wonderful boys who are at Da-
vidson and the opportunities for
the development of deep friend-
ships that will make our lives
brighter across the years.

All through the first two periods
I kept thinking of the persons J
had met at Davidson who had un-
consciously inspired me to want
to be a better person. We so often
take our friends for granted, but
it is when summer comes that we
appreciate them more and more
and invariably it is seeing them
that makes us glad when Septem-
ber rolls around again—in fact it
is the common experience which
‘we share with them which keeps
the otherwise steady routine of
our daily lives from becoming un-
bearable at times.

Surely we should be thankful to
Davidson, if for no other reason,
for bringing together such a group
among whom all of us can find
treasured friendships,

Chapel

The chapel bell soon announced
that it was time for the mid-morn-
ing siesta, and as I walked in I
was thankful for chapel which
seems to tie the student body to-
gether and give it spirit, even
though most of us would deny
this. I was hoping that the bymn
would either be “Count Your
Blessings” or “Blest Be the Tie that
Binds” but it was “Joyful, Joyful”
which seemed even more appro-
priate on such a gorgeous day. As
we sang, I thought of the student
at breakfast and wondered what
he was thinking of at this moment;
perhaps he wished we were sing-
ing “Look for the Silver Lining.”

Finally I felt thankful for the
opportunities for religious develop-
ment that Davidson offers in so
many ways and for the response of
so many students to the unrequired
Spring Services. Yes, we had a lot
for which to be thankful along
these lines.

I realized that there were many
improvements which could be made
in the Davidson scene, but I don't
think it hurts for a change to be
optimistic about our college and
blessings in life. Yes, there are
hypocrites here but aren’t there
even more outside the church? Ours
is a day when more optimism is
badly needed—after all, the things
the pessimist worries about do not

-

usually happen. Besides, life is .

much more joyful when one is
optimistic in his outlook, and we
certainly have every right to be
when we do so little ourselves and
have had so much given to us on
a silver platter. .

ing????7. What isn't!
