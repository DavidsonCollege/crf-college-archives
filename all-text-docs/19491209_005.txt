Cagers Lose Close One to McCrary; - ~
Varsity and Frosh Bow to State Teams

T-avidson Wildcats 76-69 last Tues-
day night. This was the second loss
in a row for the Wildcats who lost
-to State College Monday night.

to five points. However, David-

Brown took their respective bas-'
ketball squads into State's’ huge |
new Coliseum Monday night and
both were out-classed although
scrapping until the last whistle.

The freshman squad .was handi-
capped chiefly by a lack of Height

sun noved ahead during the list/ pups by a 73-32 margin. George
minutes of the first half to take a] King led the scoring for the iresh-

two point halftime lead.

The Wildcats looked better
against the Eagles than against
State, but they could not match the
accuracy of the Eagle set shot ar-
tists or the shooting at the foul
line. The Eagles sank a total of
25 free throws. Tommy Haller led
the Wildcat scorers with 15 points
and was followed closely by Cole-
man and Brooks who had ‘13 and
14 points respectively. “Ab” Wil-
liams was high for McCrary with
17 markers while Moran and Nance
followed with 15 and 14.

The final score at the game docs
not indicate just how close it real-
ly was. With two minutes to go, the
Eagles were leading by only one

point. They were helped consider- |

ably by several Davidson fouls
and by the new rule which liolds
that with two minutes to go in a
game, a player entitled to a foul
shot may shoot his shot and also
take the ball out of bounds for his
team.

All of the Wildcat players look-
ed much better than they did
against State. They showed a fist
break attack during the last half
of the game, which had not shown
in the State game. All in all, a great
deal of improvement was made.

Tn the main event it was simp-
ly a case of too-much height and
experience as the State Wolfpack

game Wildcats. Whit Cobb played
an outstanding game by holding

It is hoped that this idea will

a feeling of the reality and good

Construction on Statesville’s new

was the case here at Davidson.
high prices and war-time restric-
tions made ‘it necessary to postpone
the construction until the past year.
The gym is constructed of brick
veneer and the architectual scheme
fits in with the high school plant.
In addition to the large playing
court, the building contains num-
erous locker rooms, class rooms,
and work-out rooms. It is doubt-
ful if there is a town of compar-
able size with Statesville in the

Swimming Included
In Phys. Ed Program

By WOODY McKAY

As our long awaited gymnasium
nears completion, the subject of
_ swimming is being discussed more

rand more around the campus.

At the present time, the hope of
‘the athletic association is to open
;the gymnasium by the end of this
semester. Professor Pinkney says
' that they don’t plan to open the
igym until all construction is fin-|
‘ished and things are moved in.
They believe this can be done short-
ly after the Christmas holidays if
no more difficulties arise.

The opening of this new build-
ing will, of course, give students
access to the swimming pool, Head-
ed by Coach Redding, swimming
will be entered into the physical
training program. As to the content
of this instruction, there has been
nothing definitely said.

The possibility of a swimming
team has been mentioned and con-
sidered. If talent is shown in this
line, a swimming team will prob-
ably be chosen and one or two
mects may be arranged. with other
colleges. Since this is the first
year, seniors showing - swimming
ability will probably get preference
over an underclassman when the
team is chosen.

Sinée the plans are indefinite as
to the swinmning program, the Da-
vidsonian will try to keep you post-
ed as soon as any definite plans are
made.
