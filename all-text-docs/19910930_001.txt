Davidson Falls Eleven Spots in Latest U. §. News Survey

By Tom Koonce

After reaching the top ten last
year, Davidson dropped’ eleven
spots in the 1991 U.S. News &
World Report “America’s Best
Colleges” issue. The college fell
from number ten tonumber twenty-
one in national liberal arts col-
leges.

Williams College in Massa-
chusetts was. listed first in this
category followed by Swarthmore
(PA), Amherst (MA), Bowdoin
(ME), and Pomona (CA). The
only other southern school listed
in the top twenty-five was Wash-
ington & Lee, ranked behind
Davidson at number twenty-two.

Davidson was also listed as
number two in the "best buys"
category of national liberal arts
colleges. Davidson was listed
behind Washington and Lee in this
ranking of top liberal arts colleges
with lowest current tuition prices.

is progressing well despite the stag-
nanteconomy. Currently the cam-
paign has received pledges of
approximately 85 million dollars,
or 56.5% of the 150 million goal.

This campaign represents the
most ambitious fundraising effort
ever undertaken by a liberal arts

ous categories. Davidson was one
of 140 colleges in the national lib-
eral arts category.

The listing is based
on statistical data pro-
vided by each school.
This data was combined
into five categories:
financial resources, stu-
dent selectivity, faculty
resources, academic
reputation, and student
satisfaction. From these
categories a percentile
score was computed and
an overall rank was de-
termined.

This year’s ranking
of twenty-one is the
lowest Davidson has
been ranked since the
survey began in 1983.
Robert Morse, of U.S.
News and World Re-
port, said the drop was,
“Based on swings in two
variables; in financial resources
and faculty resources.”

Morse said that these catego-
ries were “two places where there

was deterioration relative to other
schools.”

The faculty resources category
is made up of four components:
1990 ratio of full-time
students to full-time
equivalent instructional
faculty, the percent of
full time faculty with
doctorates or other top
terminal degrees, the
percent of faculty with
part-time status, and the
average salary with
benefits of tenured pro-
fessors.

In 1990 Davidson
was ranked number thir-
teen in this category and
this year thecollege was
ranked number forty.
Compared to the 1990
survey we stayed the
same in faculty to stu-
dent ratio (12/1 as listed
in the magazine) and
went up from 94% to
97% in the percent of
faculty with doctorates.

Therefore, the large drop in the

faculty resources category was the
result of two small statistical fluc-
tuations. In 1989-1990 Davidson
had one part-time faculty member
and in 1990-1991 the college had
ten part-time faculty members.

Dean of Faculty Robert Wil-
liams said, “We had to hire more
part-time people to help, especially
for extra sections in languages.”

The other contributing factor
was the average salary with bene-
fits. of tenured professors. U.S.
News & World Report listed an
increase of 3.4% in faculty salary.
This listed increase was based on
1990 salaries compared with those
of 1989. Williams commented on
the fact that salaries rose almost
eight percent from the 1990-91
school year to the 1991-92 school
year.

The listed percent increase was
relatively lower than many other
schools in the survey, thus
Davidson lost ground.

For Davidson’ Continues F undraising Effort

institution Of Davidson’s size.
Osborne Bethea, Jr., the vice presi-
dent for institutional advancement,
said that the campaign’s origins
can be traced to a “‘strategic plan”
for Davidson which was written by
the Board of Trustees in 1984.
The trustees realized that
Davidson needed to strengthen its
financial base in order to maintain
its status as the South’s top liberal

arts institution and continue its
emergence as one of the nation’s
top colleges. Bethea said that the
Board of Trustees realized the
campaign was necessary “in order
to get Davidson into the 21st cen-
tury.”

The Campaign for Davidson is
a five year effort, ending July 1,
1995. The 150 million will be
distributed into three areas. 90

million will be alloted for endow-

ment purposes, the majority of
which will be used to support teach-
ing. 45 million is allotted for
physical facilities, which includes
the Baker Sports Complex and the
new arts center, The remaining 15
million is for annual operating

support. i
Clearly, this effort is ambitious.

If successful, the campaign will

more than double the school’s
endowment, while also strength-
ening academic resources and
greatly enhancing the physical
facilities.

Contributions have come from
alumni, parents, friends, corpora-
tions, and foundations. Bethea said
that with this campaign, the col-

Survey Reveals Extent of Student Alcohol & Drug Use

By Russ Tisinger

A survey administered to
Davidson students has provided
some quantification of alcohol and
drug use on campus. Visiting pro-
fessor Rebecca Marcon, with the
help of her psychology classes, ad-
ministered the survey to 260 ran-
domly selected students in the
spring of 1991.

According to the survey, in a

typical week, Davidson students .

drink an average of 12 beers and

spend an average of four hours
consuming alcohol. In the survey,
students were asked to estimate
the amount of alcohol they drank
during the past week (a week in
early March).
Fifty-three percent of the re-
spondents said that the amountthey
drank that week was “typical” of
other weeks. Thirty-five percent
of those who described the week
as “typical” consumed more alco-
hol than the weekly mean of 12

beers.

Molly Terry, the student alco-
hol and drug counselor, believes
other factors need to be analyzed to
determine the seriousness of those
statistics. If that means students
are drinking three beersin one hour
when they go out, they are proba-
bly going-out with the unhealthy
intention of drinking for the sole
purpose of getting drunk. If, how-
ever, they space out those 12 beers
during the week, those drinkers

may experience no problems.
Apparently many Davidson
$tudents are under the incorrect
impression that they drink less than
other Davidson students. Fifty-six
percent of the polled students be-
lieve they consumed less alcohol
than the average Davidsonian. Of
those, fifty-three percent actually

drink more beer than the weekly

mean.
Eighty-three percent of the
respondents were perfectly com-

fortable with the amount they
generally drank at that time. Fi-
nally, the majority of students sur-
veyed thought that underclassmen
drank more than upperclassmen,
One might expect students to
downplay the problem of alcohol
abuse at Davidson. Interestingly,
the survey indicated that the vast
majority of students believe sucha
problem exists. Ninety-five per-

Regarding Alcohol Related Problems

By Walter Price

In anattemptto promote better
awareness about the problems of
alcohol, four senior campus _lead-
ers sent out a letter to every mem-
ber of the Davidson student body
asking them to think and act re-
sponsibly with alcohol. *

The letter-was aimed at fresh-
men, tomake them aware aboutal-
cohol problems before they were
allowed to attend Patterson Court
parties.

According to Student —

Government Association President

Cammie Covington, this project

was begun by she and Patterson
Court Council President Annie
Adams.

The two of them had concerns
about alcohol problems at
Davidson and decided that a letter
might i increase awareness of such
problems. The two then asked
John Howell and Sterling Free-
man to help them compose the
letter. According to Covington,
