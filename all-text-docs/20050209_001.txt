Trustee vote allows non-Christians Board membership

By Davip Crow & ZACH KAZIOR
Editor-in-Chief Emeritus &
Senior Staff Writer

Last Friday, an overwhelming
majority of the Board of Trustees
approved an amendment to the
Trustee Bylaws that will make it
possible to elect Trustees who are
not active members of a Christian
church.

The trustees also approved a pro-
posed revision to the Statement of
Purpose and a resolution endorsing
the establishment of a faculty posi-
tion in the religion department to

Vail Commons dining hall, which was built in 1981, will have a

be held by a scholar of the
Reformed Tradition.

Although the Constitution still
requires that 24 of the 45 members
be approved by the Presbyteries of
NC, anyone, regardless of religious
background, will now be eligible
for election to the Board.

These changes come after an Ad
Hoc Committee of the Board of
Trustees unanimously recommend-
ed to the entire Board changes to
both the College’s Statement of
Purpose and the Trustee Bylaws
last October.

Until Friday, the Trustee Bylaws

Commons undergoes
first-ever renovation

By KATE GILLESPIE
Senior Staff Writer

Davidson’s dining facility, Vail
Commons, will undergo the first of
several phases of renovations this
summer.

The wall that currently separates
the serving area from the dining
room will be knocked down in
order to allow students more free-
dom of movement when getting
their food.

Although Vail Commons has
maintained a pizza and salad bar
since its original construction in
1981, it has never undergone an
actual renovation.

Dining Services Dee Phillips and
Director of Auxiliary Services
Richard Terry approached Vice
President for Business and Finance

Karen Goldstein to propose the

changes to Commons.

President Bobby Vagt gave his
approval to the plan before
Christmas.

“We have always known that
there were aspects of Vail that
needed change,” Terry said. “It
was built when the fundamental
changes in institutional dining
were just taking place. If it had
been built a few years later, it
probably would look different.”

The main problem that the first

See Commons, page 4

had stated that “all persons elected
as Trustees shall be active mem-
bers of a Christian church.”

Under the new changes, the
bylaws read, “Historically, persons
elected as Trustees have been
active members of a Christian
church. In openness to and respect
for the world’s various religious
traditions and the variety of reli-
gious preferences among the grad-
uates and friends of Davidson, the
Nominating Committee and the
Alumni Association may recom-
mend persons for the office of
Trustee who are not active mem-

bers of a Christian church but who
meet all other criteria for serving as
a Trustee. As part of continuing the
historic commitment of Davidson
to the Reformed Tradition of the
Christian faith, the Nominating
Committee shall insure that at least
80 percent of all elected Trustees
are active members of a Christian
church.”

The trustees met for two and a
half hours last Friday, during which
time both supporters and oppo-
nents of the decision voiced their
views.

“Everybody who wanted to

speak got a chance to speak.
Nobody felt constrained from say-
ing what he or she wanted to say,”
said President Bobby Vagt. “The
vote was not sliced by gender, age,
political view. You could not clas-
sify those who voted for and those
who voted against.”

The last time the Board dis-
cussed modifying the Christian
requirement was in 1996, when the
Board discussed removing the
requirement for members of the
Trustees elected by the Alumni
Association, however, the board

Professors question Honor Council

Many have stopped reporting plagiarism cases due to policies

By BLEVIN SHELNUTT
Senior Staff Writer

Since its implementation at
Davidson, the Honor Code has
provoked tensions between faculty
and Honor Council members.

Professors representing a range
of disciplines continue to feel that
the Honor Council does not deal
responsibly with plagiarism accu-
sations and many have stopped
reporting suspected cases of pla-
giarism.

Some protest that faculty expert-
ise is not valued as sufficient proof
for Honor Council juries in plagia-
rism cases. In the past, even when

many professors agreed that a stu-
dent cheated, Honor Council mem-
bers hesitated to take action with-
out a copy of the specific plagia-
rized article.

Former Honor Council Chair
Chris Knowles ’05 explained the
Council’s policies: “In a_non-
admitted guilt case, the Council
must have ‘clear and convincing’
evidence in order to come up with
a guilty verdict. If a professor sim-
ply feels that a paper was not a stu-
dent’s work but cannot find any
evidence, and the student denies
cheating, how can we say that this
student clearly and convincingly
plagiarized?”

Psychology Department Chair
Ruth Ault has been frustrated with
this mistrust of academic and pro-
fessional expertise in past cases
and suggests that the Council
should continue to reevaluate what
level of evidence constitutes proof.

Faculty members question other
aspects of the Honor Council trial
system, such as the question of stu-
dent intentionality. The Honor
Code states that “Lying is inten-
tional misrepresentation of any
form” and goes on to describe
cheating as a form of lying and
plagiarism as a form of cheating.

Kappa Sig to begin ‘recolonization’

By LesLie HEMPSON
Senior Staff Writer

Two national representatives of
Kappa Sigma Fraternity came to
campus Thursday on _— an
“exploratory visit” to determine a
timeline for the organization’s
return to Davidson.

Although Kappa Sigma has not
formally announced its return,
Patterson Court Adviser Joy
Hamm and both national represen-
tatives said that they expected the
fraternity to start “recolonization”
this spring.
