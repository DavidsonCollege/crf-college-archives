THE DAVIDSONIAN, MARCH 21, 1934

Gastonia Pastor
Is Speaker Here

J. H. Henderlite Advises
Optimism in Vesper Talk

Dr.

Dr. J. H. Henderlite, pastor of the
First Presbyterian Church of Gastonia,
was the speaker at vespers Sunday eve-
ning. He chose for his topic, “The
Sunshine Club.” the spirit of which he
centered on the example of an heroic
cripple, Joe Schnitzler, of Mt. Pleas-
ant, Michigan. E. G, Holt was in
charge of the service, and called on
Blanton Little to lead in prayer. Mor-
ton Cunningham and Hubert Morris
played a cornet duet, “In the Garden,”
with A. D, Wauchope accompanying
at the ergan.

“The Sunshine Club,” said Dr. Hen-
derlite, “is different from optimism,
which is usually nothing more than
mere words. It is something inside of
us, something independent of the out-
side weather. I heard the other day
a definition of the pessimist and the
optimist: The pessimist is the man
who, when offered the choice of two
evils, takes both. The optimist is the
man who, when the world hands him
a lemon, takes it and makes a glass
of lemonade out of it.” Joe Schnitzler
was such a man. He contracted-a se-
vere bone disease which resulted in
the amputation of both legs and one
of his arms, yet he went ahead with
his study of law and was invited to
practice in partnership by a prominent
lawyer of his town.

He devised a tricycle-sort of an af-
fair which heé-can propel and guide
about town and every day is on hand
early at his office. He makes it a prac-
tice to enter in all the activities of
his fellow citizens, and even enjoys an
occasional hunting trip. He has decid-
ed the world has no use for a recluse,
so he sees to it that he gets into the
life of his community as much as pos-
sible.

Joe has come out of his experience
with the following philosophy of life:
“Don’t feel sorry for the other fellow.
Let him get out and make a place for
himself in the world, Success? Well,
it’s not money. Real happiness depends
on what is inside of you; and your atti-
tude toward other people. Let a man
hide his troubles and he will forget
he ever had them, I believe in God,
though I can’t understand His ways.”

Dr. Henderlite nominated Joe Schnit-
zler for the presidency of the Sun-
shine Club and issued a general invi-
tation to his hearers to join with it in
its spirit. ;

Omega Phi Alpha Holds

Init i a tio n Ceremonies

Omega Phi Alpha, honorary philos-
ophy and psychology fraternity, ini-
tiated ten new members at the meet-
ing held last Friday evening. Jack
Williams, Jr., president of the chap-

ter, conducted the initiation ceremony. |,

Relatively little interest has been
shown in Omega Phi Alpha until this
year and for the first time a formal
initiation ceremony was observed,

Lyman W. Clardy, of the club, wrote
the impressive initiation ceremony
which was used. Those initiated were:
Rigdon Dees, Hugh Hawkins, William
M. Brown, John Carroll Miller, G. T.
Newman, Albert Colwell, Robert H.
Smith, Audley Gammon, and Warner
DuBose. G. H. Brown and John Fitz-
gerald were unable to attend and will
be initiated at a later meeting.

W. T. Thompson is program chair-
man of the club. The program con-
sisted of an enjoyable paper on
“Laughter” by Audley Gammon. Mr.
Gammon told something of the history
of laughter and its effect on the indi-
vidual. It is announced that Rigdon
Dees is to give the main talk at the
next club meeting, to be held in April.

Seniors Have Smoker
To Discuss Class Gift

A discussion of the gift to be given
to the college by the Senior class this
year was the main business brought
up at the senior smoker held Friday
evening, March 16, in the Chambers
banquet hall. Approximately sixty sen-
iors were present at the informal meet-
ing which was presided over by Fred
L. Smyre, president of the Senior class.

Several suggestions for a senior gift
were offered, but none has yet’ been
accepted. The suggestions will be
looked into and will be voted on at
the next meeting of the’ class,

The senior week-end which will be
given for the graduating members by
the faculty was next discussed. An
outline of the affair was made and the
seniors selected April 7 as the most
suitable date for the occasion. They
announced their desire to have a ban-
quet with girl visitors to the campus.

Refreshments were served at the
close of the meeting.

Students Permitted
Radios Rest of Year

At the meeting of the executive com-
mittee of the faculty held last Thurs-
day, March 15, a petition was offered
to the committee by the president of
the student body, Julian West, con-
cerning the using of radios in the dor-
mitories, with the result that radios
will be allowed from this time on, un-
der jurisdiction of the Student Council,

Mrs, N. T. Smith, supervisor of dor-
mitories of the college, was instrumen-
tal in procuring the approval of the
committee on this question,

West announced that no restrictions
would be placed on students owning
radios, unless complaints were lodged
against them, and offered the follow-
ing plan to enforce the proper use of
radios:

Every student owning a radio will
be asked to turn his name in to those
in charge. A typewritten list will be
made of these names. If a complaint
is made against a certain person, a
check will be made by that person's
name, and a card of warning will be
sent to him.

When three complaints are recorded
against any one person, he will be
asked to turn in his radio. If anyone
fails to turn in his name as possessing
a radio, and it is found out, only two
complaints will be necessary to for-
feit his radio.

This plan is only being tried out this
year, and, whether it succeeds or not,
the president of the student body next
year will have to appear before the
executive committee at the beginning
of the year in order to procuré per-
mission to continue this plan.

Conflagration Damages
Johnson’s Barber Shop

Last Wenesday afternoon at about
12:30 o'clock the local fire-fighters
were called to the building occupied
by Johnson's Barber Shop, where a
fire had been started from some un-
known source. Twice later in the day,
alarms were put in for blazes in the
Same locality.

The first fire was believed to have
been entirely extinguished, but about
3 o'clock another broke out and again
at 7 o'clock flames were reported to
be existing in the rear of this build-
ing.

The barbers declare that the last one
Was set on purpose, because papers
soaked in some sort of highly inflam-
mable fluid were discovered “at the
scene of the blaze.

Theatre Presents :
‘Fashions of 1935”

William Powell and Bette Davis
To Be Starred

* Davidson theatergoers will see prac-
tically all new shows this coming week.
There is one of the most popular of
the present beauty extravaganzas,
fashions of 1934, and some good action
pictures, but the rest will probably be
scorned because they are“so new that
they have not had the opportunity to
become famous. i

Crime

This story deals with the old case of
the woman who loves her husband,
and finds that he is unfaithful to her.

cludes stars with much ability towards
drama. Ruth Chatterton, Adolphe
Menjou, and Claire Dodd are in the
cast.

Thursday and Friday, March 22 and
23—Fashions of 1934
There is nothing much to do with
the name of this picture, but there are
a few scenes which will be enjoyable
both to the men and women who like
fashions, and those who show the fash-
ions. William Powell takes the lead
with Bette Davis, He manages to get
in on a new racket, that of stealing
fashions from Paris and selling them
as his own, In the cast are Hugh
Herbert and Frank McHugh, and
there is much comedy mixed in with
the action and beauty.

Saturday, March 24—Wharf Angel

Sidney Minault
Addresses Club

‘Le-Cercle- Francais Hears Ohio
Graduate Tuesday :

Le Cercle Francais held an open
meeting last night in Chambers. The
original plan of the club was to have a
joint meeting with the Alliance Fran-
caise of Salem College, but due to sick-
ness in the cast of the play which the
Salem club was to present, the girls
were unable to come.

However, in spite of this misfortune,
the club presented a very entertaining
program. Mr. Sidney Minault, a grad-
uate of the University of Ohio and a
native-born Englishman who has spent
the greater part of his life studying
in France, was the guest-speaker of
the evening. Mr. Minault was well
versed in both the English and French
languages and gave a lecture jn
French on incidences from his life in
the United States and France.

Lanier Pratt, president of the Da-
vidson circle, presided over the meet-
ing and gave a recitation in the form
of a comic dialogue which had been
taken from one of the phonographic
records that the local French classes
are now studying,

Immediately following Pratt’s recita-
tion was the presentation of Tristan
Bernard’s one-act comedy, L’Anglais
Tel Qu’on le Parle. The cast included
the following members of the club:
La Caissiere, George Gullette; Le Gar-
con, Jack Williams; Julien Cicandel,
