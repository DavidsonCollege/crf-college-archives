Women’s tennis “has a shot” at Tourney Victory

By ALISON KALETT
Sports Editor

The Wildcats were out to make a statement to
the rest of the Southern Conference that they are in
top form for this week’s conference tournament.
They did just that as the ‘Cats won two key
conference matches and three out of their last four

regular season con-

estern Carolina 0 tests.

Davidson — 6 Against Western
Carolina all six

UTC 7 Davidson singles
Davidson Bi players won their

Winthrop a sets, dropping only
Davidson 5 seven games com-
bined. Both senior

ETSU 4 Claire Cheatwood
Davidson 5 and Freshman

Forbes Thompson
won their respective matches 6-0, 6-0.

The ‘Cats next conference foe was the Uni-
versity of Tennessee Chattanooga. Davidson
seemed to have caught a break when UTC’s #1
seed decided not to play five minutes before the
match began. The ‘Cats, however, failed to capi-
talize as Davidson dropped four of six singles
matches and all three doubles.

“This was our most disappointing loss,” said
head coach Caroline Price. “We did not play well

and we did not take advantage of an opportunity.”
Next, the ‘Cats looked to rebound against
non-conference foe Winthrop College. In singles

play, senior Dana Casner, senior Amber Bradford,
freshman Forbes Thompson, and freshman Eliza-
beth Moreno all won in straight sets giving the

‘Cats a 4-2 lead heading into doubles play.
The duo of Casner and Bradford overcame an
early 0-5 deficit to secure an 8-6 victory and the

overall Davidson win.

In their last regular season match, the ‘Cats
took on conference rivals ETSU. ‘

Seniors Casner and Bradford ended their
seasons in solid form as they won their matches 6-
2,6-2 and 6-3, 7-6 respectively. Also, Thompson
and Marks won in straight sets. Casner’s victory
was especially impressive because ETSU’s #1
previously had beaten one of the conference’ s best
players in Furman’s #1 seed.

In doubles play, the third seeded team of
Thompson and senior Kirstyn Leuner were the
unlikely heroes, as they secured a Davidson vic-
tory with their 8-3 win.

The ‘Cats finished the regular season at 8-8
overall and 5-4 in the Southern Conference.

Looking ahead to the conference champion-
ships which begin this Thursday at Davidson,
Price says the ‘Cats have a legitimate chance to
win the title.

“We have a shot.” Price said. “We have
momentum, five seniors, and we’re at home. The
keys will be doubles and consistency in singles. At
each of the six positions we need to play solid
singles, stay together, and execute. The team that
can put together three solid matches together back-
to-back will win.”

The tournament seeding has not been final-
ized, but Price anticipates that Davidson will be
the fifth seed while UNC- G, Furman, UTC, and,
The College of Charleston will occupy the first
through fourth seeds.

Davidson will take to the courts on Friday for
the first round and the semifinals and finals will be
held over the weekend. The tournament winner
earns a birth in the NCAA championships.

Last weekend the men’s track team com-
peted at the Duke Invitational. The meet, a peren-
nial team favorite, provided a perfect combination
of weather, competition, and an amazingly fast
mondo track.

Competition began Friday afternoon with
sprints as senior Stan Baker ran the 400m hurdles
in 61.16 seconds. Baker also ran a 23.36 200m.
Senior Gray Austin ran a strong 100m in 11.37
seconds. Rounding out the sprints, freshman Grant
Bleecher ran a 52.27 400m followed closely by
junior John Moore in 54.19.

Later Friday evening, the -‘Cat’s distance

medley team competed. Freshman Jay Jahnes
opened with a strong 1200m in 3:08.9. He handed
off to senior Michael Albert, who despite illness,
charged through a 51.6 400m. Next, sophomore
Keith Chapman ran a 1:56.3 800m leg and handed
off to freshman anchor Dan Gibson who closed
with a 4:17.5 1600m. The team’s 10:14.48 puts
them second behind the school record. “The guys
came close this year.” said Head Coach Gary
Andrew,” I’m sure they will smash it next time.”

In the 5000m Friday night, junior Brent Ferrell
flew to a 14:53.24 personal record, and moved
much closer to the school record. Ferrell hopes to
catch the record at the Conference meet this year.
Also in the 5000m, junior Pat Burchett shattered
his week old PR, and jumped down to an amazing

15:14.80 with a Sth place finish in his heat. Fresh-
man Paul Irwin continued his steady improvement
witha 15:54.01 PR. Junior William Isenhour, after
an extended break, was unable to finish.

Saturday morning brought another great day
of competition. The Cat’s had a strong showing in
the men’s 1500m. Gibson started the meet on a
high note by easily winning his heat with a school
record breaking 3:57.90. Ferrell made the school’s
top-ten performer list with a 4:04.79 and finished
third in his heat. Chapman won his heat in 4:12.31
and was closely followed by Senior Keith Gordon,
4:22.89.

In the 800m, Jahnes made the top-ten per-
former list with a PR of 1:56.95. Senior Davey
Bacon, with a characteristically strong finish, ran

a PR of 1:57.68. Close behind Bacon, Junior
Thomas McElveen cruised through a 2:00.24.

e men’s 3000m steeple chase, junior
e Beserker” Hutchins, ran 11:06.59.

he men’s 4x100m relay team, Baker, Aus-
tin, Albert, Moore, had bad luck with their hand
offs, and failed to finish the race, but the 4x400m
team ran well. Albert led with a 52.1, and handed
off to Bacon, who blazed through a 50.7 split.
Bleecher took the baton next, and finished strong
with a breakthrough 50.9. Chapman anchored the
team with a 50.4. Their season’s best time of
3:24.17 moved them within three seconds of the
school record.

Easter weekend found the Davidson women’s

sixty colleges: Villanova, Georgetown, George
Mason and UNC to name a few.

Freshman phenomenon Lucy Billingsley,
racing the 3000-meter, crossed the finish line in

Along with Billingsley’s accomplishment,
two Davidson school records were smashed over
the weekend. Sophomore Smyth Bitter, with a
time of 2:14.69, shattered the 800-meter record by
four seconds. Bitter held the previous record of
2:18.

Also broken, the Distance Medley Record,
consisting of a 1200-meter, 400 meter, 800 meter
