Publicize issues of personal safety

Leigh Hall and Mibs Raney

To the Davidson student body:

Two weeks ago, a Davidson student, ayoung word was
running alone after dark on the road to Cornelius. She was
followed and assaulted by a man. She was fortunate to be
aided by a Davidson staff member who happened to be
driving by. Although verbally and physically threatened,
she was not injured.

Several points concern us about this incident. First of all,
it brings up questions of students’ safety in and around
Davidson. Secondly, this. is one of a number of safety-

_ Telated occurrences which have been communicated to the
college community primarily by rumour and have not been
acknowledged in an official manner by the College. Stories
circulate, but why should we trust them? They’re only word

_ Of mouth, This inattention or avoidance of personal safety
issues is pervasive among students and college officials. To
elaborate:

As freshmen, we were indoctrinated in the joyful fringe

benefits of the Honor Code: leave your. doors unlocked!
leave your books anywhere you want! this is a safe place.
Even now, we hear the occasional student leading campus
tours, repeating this litany of wishful thinking. Itis difficult
to resist tooting Our own horn; compared to many schools,
Davidson enjoys an unusually high trust level. This is
something to be proud of. However, we rest too comforta-
bly with this idea. We are reluctant to recognize that that
there are potentially dangerous situations around us. It is
essential that we recognize them openly.

It is understandable that victims of crime are reluctant to
discuss*their losses; their privacy should be respected. °
Furthermore, it is not their responsibility to keep us in-
formed. The expected sources of information, the Campus
Police, the Dean of Students Office and the Davidsonian, do
keep us informed about vandalism and theft, but they do not
circulate reports of personal assault. How often do violent
acts gounreported? Why are they began cee nn!

~ tion?
If we remain ignorant of violent or these actions

that are taking place, we will assume that we’re safe. We

will walk and jog alone at night. We will leave our doors-
unlocked. We will assume that all court parties are safe for
young women. Our decisions about risky behavior are
based on what we know and how safe we believe | we are.
Information which helps us gauge the climate of safety at
Davidson must not be withheld, Access to this information
is Crucial for every student’s decisions about safety.

We propose that pertinent information from police re-
ports, currently submitted only to the Dean of Student's
Office, be published in the Davidsonian or in the weekly
announcements . We believe that this communication
will goalong way in dispelling anxiety-producing rumours,
and will enable the college community to make more
informed decisions about their personal safety. We should
a. eee
protect us.
