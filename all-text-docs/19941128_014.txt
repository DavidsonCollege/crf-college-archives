Football takes big bowl win

By Will Cobb

The Davidson football team
closed out their season in fine fash-
ion with the school’s first bowl
victory, a 28-14 trouncing of the
University of the South. The sec-
ond annual Bermuda Bow! paired
the Wildcats and Sewanee last sum-
mer in an effort to provide two
small college programs with a fun
way to end the season.

The offensive frustration dur-
ing the season ended as Davidson
ran over the competition with over
300 yards rushing on the after-
noon, averaging over six yards a
carry. Senior Chris Leak had his
best game as a Wildcat running
back, gaining a monstrous 235
yards on 31 carries. Leak’s effort
came just 25 yards shy of the school
record for individual rushing per-
formance, set in 1981 by tailback
Ray Sinclair.

The Wildcats went into half-

timé with a slim 6-0 lead on the
strength of Kevin Holzworth’s
touchdown pass to Bruce Bannis-
ter. The lead was opened up in the
third quarter when Holzworth threw
his second touchdown sc of the

Chris Leak

afternoon, this time to senior
wideout Ike Bailey on a 50-yard
pass play. The Wildcats went for
the two point conversion when
Holzworth hooked up with Tighe
Crovetti.

Davidson would add another
score to head into the fourth quar-
ter with a comfortable 21-0 lead.
Just when Sewanee appeared to
climb back into the competition,
Leak put the game away for good
when he broke for a71 yard touch-
down run to wrap up the team’s
scoring for the game and teh year.
Holzworth ended his career strong
with a strong outing, going 15 of

28 for 224 yards with three touch- -

down passes and one interception.
Crovetti finished with four catches
for 58 yards while Bailey pulled
down four throws for 78 yards,
each with one touchdown.
Although the season was
plagued with injuries and frustra-
tion, Davidson was able to end the
1994 season with two straight vic-
tories. Davidson hopes that this
momentum will carry into head

‘coach Tim Landis’ third season as

a head coach.

Volleyball loses v. UNCC

By Dave Aycock

Davidson’s women’s volley-
ball team played its home finale on
Tuesday night, losing to county
rival UNC-Charlotte three games
totwo. It was a special evening for
the ‘Cats, as they took time before
the match to honor the lone senior
on the squad, Lorie Logan.

Logan’s many accomplish-
ments were listed to the crowd, the
most impressive of which were her
3,503 career assists. The emotion
of the pre-game ceremony causéd
the Wildcats to come out flat, and
in the first game UNCC jumped
out toa 11-1 lead before taking the
game 15-5.

The ‘Cats were able to play to
a 4-0 lead in the second game, but
the 49ers gradually came back and
broke away again to take the game
15-9. It seemed at this point that
everyone would be going home
early, as UNCC had completely
dominated all areas of play, and
then scored the first three points of

the third game. However,
Davidson fought back behind the
strong spikes of outside hitter
Michele Augustin and took the
game 15-12. The spirit of the ‘Cats
carried over to the fourth game as
they ran out to an 8-3 lead over the
tiring 49ers. UNCC mounted a
small comeback, pulling to within

_ two points at 10-8, but the ‘Cats:

were too strong, and they forced a
fifth and final game with a 15-9
score. Unfortunately, the ’Cats
may have expended too much en-
ergy in their comeback, as UNCC
found themselves in time to take
the game and the match with a
score of 15-8.

Overall, the Wildcats found
themselves matched againsta team
that was more athletic and power-
ful, but the home team was nearly
able to pull out a victory through
sheer determination. Davidson
closed out its season last weekend
at the conference tournament at
Chattanooga, Tennessee.

Southern Conference Basketball Preview:
Davidson, UTC are teams to beat

By Matt Pitzer

The conference might be
sporting a different look, going to
divisional play for the first time
ever. But the top of the conference
likely will remain the same.

Tennessee-Chattanooga and
Davidson, which finished one-two
last season, are expected to be the
class of the Southern Conference
again.

Despite losing two starters
from last season, including pesky

guard Chad Copeland, the Bucca-'

neers should win the Southern Di-
vision handily. They received nine
of the ten first-place votes in the
coaches’ pre-season poll. Western
Carolina will place second and then
Georgia Southern, Furman, and
The Citadel.

The Wildcats, meanwhile,
were the top choice in the Northern
Division, receiving four first-place
ballots. They should be followed
by Appalachian State, East Ten-
nessee State, Marshall, and VMI.

The conference adopted the
divisional format to reduce the
number of conference games each

team played each sesaon, giving
schools the opportunity to sched-
ule more and better. non-confer-
ence games with the hope of rais-
ing the Southern Conference’s
reputation across the country.

Instead of playing every other
team twice during the regular sesan,
teams will now only face the other
squads in their division and one
designated rival from the other di-
vision twice. Teams play the other
four schools in the opposite divi-
sion just once for a total of 14
conference games. Davidson’s
designated rival in the Southern
Division is Furman.

Because of the divisional
setup, the conference tournament
has changed somewhat as teams
will play only schools from the
other divsion in the first round.

The most significant conse-
quence of sucha tournament is that
teams will be matched up against

nament time. That is no longer so,
which could result in some sur-
prises.

But what won’t be a surprise
is the success of UT-Chattanooga,
-the conference’s representative in
the NCAA tournament last year.
Coach Mack McCarthy needs a
point guard to replace Copeland,
and he will have to choose be-
tween junior college transfer
Marcus Watkins, senior Fred
Moore, and freshmen Bernard
Smith and Lincoln Walters. Up
front, all three starters return, in-
cluding preseason all-conference
forward Brandon Born and center
Roger Smith. These three are an
imposing force inside and will lead
the Buccaneers.

Western Carolina is all about
Frankie King. The 6-1 senior guard
was last year’s media conference
Player of the Year and is a unani-
mous pick as preseason Player of

e

squads they only faced once dur- the Year. King averaged 26.9 points
ing the regular season. Previously, per game last season and had 11
since Davidson played UT-Chat- games of 30 or more points as well

tanooga twice, they were quite
