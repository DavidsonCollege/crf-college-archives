Bicycle thefts plague students

By WALTER LEE
Staff Writer

Junior Karen Long’s bicycle
has been stolen three times this
year. Sophomore Jim North-
rup’s is missing for the third
time. Other students report
similar problems.

Bicycle theft seems to be
widespread around Davidson.

However, Campus Security
Chief J.G. Hughes said that
nearly all stolen bicycles are
eventually found abandoned a-
round campus. He said only five
bicycles have been reported
missing this year. All but one of
these have been recovered.

Apparently, there are more
thefts than what students re-
port. In cases of multiple thefts,
the first instance is reported but
not necessarily subsequent

°

ones. In other cases no report is
made at all.

Students have a casual atti-
tude about the thefts, possibly
because of the high rate of
recovery and usual lack of
damage to the bicycles. —

Northrup feels bicycle thefts
are indicative of the problems of
a growing community. It is
something to be lived with, he
said. Long said that she is
‘pretty disappointed’’ in the
people who take the bicycles.

Assistant Dean of Students
Sue Ross said that to her
knowledge no students have
brought charges of bicycle
theft.

Ross likened bicycle theft to
taking books from the library,
without checking them out. She
said both of these offenses

Heppner also pointed. out
that there is very little recruit-
ment of women. ‘‘It’s frus-
trating. Involvement is great,
but you want excellence,’ She
said, Perhaps the largest prob-
lem for women athletes, Ashley
said, is that Davidson as yet
has no philosophy for women’s
athletics. __

Some put academics a ‘‘distant

ness, according to Perkey. But
all agree that Davidson is
primarily an academic school,

sacrifices. ‘‘A lot of people on

Rhyne said, “primarily for so-

the honor system.

The Student Conduct Council
is “always questioning how to
handle cases,” she said, adding

that this problem was a difficult

one.

She feels students should
discuss whether bicycle theft is
a definite violation of the Honor

Code and if so, steps should be .

taken to crack down on stud-
ents who take bicycles.

News At A Glance

Board of Visitors convenes

The Davidson College Board of Visitors, a 170 member group of
business, professional, and community leaders, will meet on
campus this Friday. ’

The visitors will participate in special sessions on admissions,
finance, and téadership.

SGA starts alumni relations

The Executive Council, a newly formed arm of the SGA, will
launch a Student/Alumni Relations program in the upcoming
week.

The program was the brain-child of Ken Krieg and other
jnembers of the SGA’s Executive Council, which is composed of
senators who convene to ‘‘discuss ideas.”’ Students will be given a
list of five to ten alumni in their area to contact during the summer.
The Council will be seeking students to volunteer in the next week
or so, Krieg said.

Asked othr a program is needed, Krieg said that aside from

fraternities, there is no real program for Student/Alumni relations.
Davidsons ‘‘Best resources are its students,’’ Krieg said. The two
primary ‘‘rewards”’ of the new program will be that students can
discuss Davidson life with alumni who have experienced the same
thing, and students will be able to seek advice from former
Davidson students.

In addition to benefitting the students, the new program will
also aid alumni. The Council’s bulletin noted, ‘‘it will give (them)
the chance to relive times past and become involved in present
developments.”’

Krieg mentioned that an increase in alumni giving will,
hopefully, be a by-product of the program. Fundraising, however,

is not the primary aim.

coached idson’s College
Bowl to several national
championships, will be replaced
in the English Department by
Cynthia Leevis from Harvard.

Retzer already left David-
son to do w i the Environ-
mental Protection Agency.

Koller.said he plans to move
back to the western states. He
probably will not return to
teaching. Beyond this, he said,
he has made no plans.

Like Retzer and Koller, Zieg-
ler has taught at Davidson for
seven years. This summer she
will be attending a seminar at
Stanford on-a National Endow-
ment for the Humanities grant.
As for the near future, Ziegler
said she definitely wants to
continue teaching. She has ap-
plied for at least twenty posi-
tions and is now awaiting
replies.

The four professors who will
be on leave next year reflect a
great diversity of interests.
Kincaid is running for the U.S.
House of Representatives a-
gainst former Davidson Biology
Professor Jim Martin. Kincaid
has been at Davidson for thir-
teen years and will take a two
year leave because “I will be in
Congress.’’. According to Kin-
caid, the Economics Depart-
ment has found a temporary
replacement for him.

Yoder will spend his one year
leave for which he received a
Fulbright fellowship, in Gabon,

Professors

Africa. He said his decision to
go to Gabon was prompted by
he and his wife’s desire for their
children to experience life in an
underdeveloped country. Also,
Yoder has a deep interest in
African culture and literature.

Jacobus is taking a year or
two off to work with the
Prudential Insurance Associa-
tion as a.Group Manager. He
said that after nine years of
teaching he wants to ‘“‘try
something different for a
while.”

Replacements for both Yoder
and Jacobus in the French
Department have been found,
but Jacobus’ replacement has
not been signed yet.

Unlike the other three profes-
sors who are taking their leave
next year, Mark Davies will
remain in the classroom, but as
a student. Davies is leaving
Davidson after six years of
teaching to attend law school at
the University of North Caro-
lina. “‘One does not enter law
school lightly,’’ Davies said,

and he plans to complete the full.

three years of study. However,
Davies will not make his final
decision as to whether or not he
will return to Davidson until
next fall. A one-year replace-
ment for Davies has been found.

Four other professors are alan.

leaving next year. Garrett has
been at Davidson for two years
as.a visiting professor. He was
hired as a sabbatical replace-
.ment for Chemistry Professor

Ralph Gable and was kept on
for an additional year as “the
eighth man in a seven-man
department to help revamp the
junior year chemistry curricu-
lum. Next year Garrett will
move to Columbus, Ohio, to
work with Battelle Memorial
Institute on an EPA pfoject
concerning disposal of hazard-
ous waste materials. Garrett
will not be replaced.

Smith will assume a position
at St. Olaf'’s College in Minne-
sota next year. She said she
prefers St. Olaf’s because it has
a nationally recognized mathe-
matics department. Also,
Smith said she wants a change
from Davidson’s ‘“‘lack of @
community of young single
people.’

Ultee was hired for one year
and his contract was not renew-
ed. He has received a grant for
work this summer and will soon
have a book published by Yale
University. He will be teaching
at the University of Alabama
next year, having received a
“terrific offer’ from them. The
administration at Alabama told
him that he will be considered
for tenure in three years. Ultee
feels that Davidson needs
“more research support” and
‘more committment to younger
professors.” :

Young has been on leave this
year with the EPA. Next year
he will go to the University of
North Carolina at Greensboro
to take an administrative pos!-
tion.
