TEACHING SECONDARY

‘Tutee’s’ Self-Image

Important To STEP

STEP — four letters repre-
senting the newest organiza.
tion on the Davidson campus,
the Student Tutorial Educa-
tion Project.

The Project was organized
only ‘a month ago as the brvin-
child of three Davidson stu-
dents — Marvin Sparrow,
Mike Norris and Jordie Lang
— who spent last summer
working in culturally deprived
communities.

The central program of
STEP has thus far been the
Elementary Tutorial Program,
working with fourth, fifth, and
sixth grade students in Cor
nelius and Davidson Schools.

Over 50 Davidson students

are now involved in tutorial
work on an individual basis,
with one tutor to one ‘‘tutee”’
(a word which has been wide
ly spread over the Davidson
campus by STEP members.).

The individual tutor concept
has been adopted by the group
as the most effective means of
accomplishing its primary ob
jective: “to improve the tu
tee’s self-image.”

Sparrow emphasized the im-
portance of this primary ob-
jective. “It is not the tutor’s
main job to teach. We are not
trained to do this, and our
work in this area is designed
only to supplement the teach-
ing done in the classroom.

“It is much more important
that we encourage each tutee
to build a better personal
image of himself.”

Lang pointed out that much
of the problem in this area
had been caused by the de
prived environment of the
child.

“The parents often take no
interest whatsoever in the
child’s school work, and some-
times do little to encourage his
interest in studies."

Lang worked last summer
with Self-Help Housing, Inc.,
a low income housing project
in a rural section of South-
eastern Pennsylvania, founded
by the Office of Economic Op-
portunity, and therefore is

experienced with this type of
situation.

Norris and Sparrow worked
in similar areas with Youth
Educational Services, Sparrow
in Greensboro and Norris in
Charlotte.

At present, 25 students from
Davidson School and 25 from
Cornelius School are being tu-
tored under the STEP pro
gram.

This group contains approxi-

mately one-third white child
ren.

The tutees were selected on
the basis of a reading achieve
ment test given in schools, and
all are participating in the
program voluntarily

The tutors were given two
hours of initial preparation,
with an orientation session
conducted by the group's three
directors and a discussion with
a reading specialist on remed-
ial reading techniques.

The ‘orientation included
background on the founding of
STEP, the goals of the tutor
ial program, and preparation
for general problems that
might be encountered by tu
tors.

The importance of first es-
tablishing a rapport with the
tutee was emphasized, and
Lang noted that various me
thods have been used to ac
complish this task, from play-
ing football with the child to
reading comic books in the
Hub with him,

Tutors were also advised to
use imagination and creativity
in attempting to help tutees
with academic weaknesses.

Norris pointed. out that this
tutoring was strictly informal,
and he suggested that a more
formal atmosphere, simulat
ing the classroom, would be
much less effective.

In addition to this advance
preparation, the group has a
program of continuing in-ser
vice training sessions -——- term
ed “feedback” by Norris

problems.

The tutors are organized in.
to six groups for this purpose,
and each group discusses in
dividual problems in seminar
fashion.

The leaders of the six groups
are Cary Hewitt, John Sartor-
ius, Bill Andrews, Furman
Wallace, Ned Kelly and Stew
Brown.

One tutor noted the ‘‘chal
lenge"’ that the program of
fered to the tutor.

“It is frustrating, but at the
same time rewarding. You
want to help him so badly, but
you realize that you aren't
really going to be able to help
him much with his _ school
work, or make him become
interested in it.”

He observed that he was
not equipped to teach, but that
he could offer his child the
opportunity to practice, and,
perhaps more important, he
could offer him encourage
ment.

The two have played foot
ball together, are attending the
play this weekend, and will al-
so travel with the entire group
of tutors and tutees to see the
circus in Charlotte on Sunday.
This particular tutor has been
using the ‘‘Peanuts’’ cartoon
books to give his student the
opportunity to practice his
reading.

He noted some evidence of
success. ‘When I first. started
out, I was just so discouraged.
He was so. shy, he wouldn't
even look at me when he talk
ed. But he’s come out some.
He’s much more outgoing, at
least with me.”

Tutors devote from three to

six hours a week to their tu-
tees.

Generally, tutors have been
left on their own with this
program. They have been left
to arrange their meeting times
and places, and to devise their
own techniques for teaching.

One tutor has had his tutee
write letters to him to give
him practice at writing. An
other has taught his tutee to
use a camera; and with the
pictures the two have taken,
the tutee will design some
Christmas cards to send this
year.

Various tutees have been
seen on campus for the last
three weeks, in the library,
learning to use the card cata
logue, at
touring Chambers.

The interest evidenced by the
student body has been unusu
ally high, and the general fee!
ing among the student body
seems to be that STEP is one
of the most worthwhile organi
zations to be formed on the
Davidson campus in recent
years.

The current program is an
outgrowth of last year's YMCA
Tutorial program. Sparrow
and Norris were appointed
last spring to chair the YMCA
Tutorial Committee this year,
and after working with similar
projects this summer, they
returned to Davidson with the
idea for STEP.

They were soon joined by
Lang, whose interest had also
been aroused in working with
such a program by summer
work. The three currently are
serving as the directors of
STEP.

They have been assisted
with planning by the Charlotte
YES workers; by Chris San
ford, a Project Opportunity
worker in Charlotte; and by
the principal of the Cornelius
School.

While the Elementary Tutor
ial Program has been the cen-
tral activity of the group thus
far, the enthusiastic STEP di
rectors are actively seeking to
expand the project's program
to include numerous other en
deavors.

Lang and Leslie Brown have
originated a Pre-College Guid
ance Program, which is al
most ready to begin operation
under the leadership of Ken
Autrey.

Under this program, David
son students would seek to
provide information on post-
graduate college and voca
tional education, with empha
sis on the availability of fi-
nancial aid.

Lang pointed out that many
of the students about whom
the group was concerned had
never even considered higher
education due to the lack of
financial resources in their
families.

The Guidance Program will
be two-fold, with both group
sessions to make general in
formation available to stu-
dents and individual sessions
to offer more specific help to
each child.

While the program is de-

Another plan for the near
future calls for STEP to spon
sor several field trips for the
children involved in its tutor-
ial program, *‘to build in them
an awareness of the world
around them,” and to expose
them to other persons. who
have succeeded in overcoming
backgrounds which were cul
