Peter Hobbie and senior
Stan Link joined Thacker in
mating a trip to Greensboro
Tuesday to talk with Demo-
cratic backers of Kennody.
All three had visited Ken-
nedy national headquarters
In Washington during spring
vacation, where they receiv-
ed the go-ahead for trying
whatever they thought would
help. They “left us free to act

—what they necd is ideas,"
explained Thacker,

The three students have
called a genernl meeting of
ony students backing Ken
nedy for 3 p.m. Monday in’
14 Chambers.

Thacker said that after
talking to parly members at
Greenshoro, he felt that the
students “can be of grent nid
to them.”

“We really feel ye can be

nv force that can determine
things.”” Thacker concluded.
Hobbie deseribed the situ-
ation in Washington at the
headquarters as confusing.
ince the Kennedy group was
just moving in. Both Kennedy
and his brother. Scnator Ted
Kennedy of Alassachusetts,
have tnoved out of Senate of-
fices into the new office
building which will serve as
campaign headquarters.

_ Stalinist Era Evokes

‘Horror, Adulation’

Libural writers and Intel-
Jevtunle are exposing the
truth atinut the Stalinist era,
according !o Dr. Edanund T.
Welont, professor of languag-
es at Queens College, who
apole Tuestay aight at the
SAE buuse Jn the *Blow-up
00" series.

Wetunt, who tenches Rus-
sion history, Meerature and
langunge, as well as German,
has translated many modern
Rusgsinn poame and read 5r-
lections from poeta such as
Akiimatova and Yevtushen.
ko.

Welant said that there are
two extremes of feeling about
the Stalin years, ‘one of hor:
ror and the other of adula-
don for the good old past.”

Welant said that the adulu-
tion of the past was exempil-
fled wy novelist Mikhail Sho-
Jokhoy's call for m return to
direct methods of revolution-
ary justice. He added that
other writers ‘expressed a
feeling of cold horror, the
kind that slams the door on
the dark corridors that lead
to the past.”

Boris Pasternak, author of
Dr. Zhivago, had said that
the Soviet literary reform
would come from ihe grass
roots, according to Weiant.

“So when you read about.
iberalization of literature In
Rusgia,”’ Welant said, “keep
your eye on the grass. for
that’s where the action Is.”'

Weiant read selections from
several Russian poems, in-
cluding the highly amusing
“Fire in the Architectural [n-
stitute’, whch describes the
process by which one young
man became a poct.

The poem feseribes the
feelings of a young architec-
tural student watching his
degree work going up in
flames along with all the rest
of the nrchitectural institute.
At the middle of the poem
the young man realizes that
he cannot re-do all the work
helna destroyed in the fire,
and he therefore decides to
become a poet.

Weiant said that many Rus-
sians bellove poetry to be the
national art, much as paint-
ing Is the French nationnl
art.
