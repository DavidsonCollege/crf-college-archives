Winston to be Scene of
Davidson-North Caro-
lina Football Classic

Carolina’s Defeat by V. M. I. Has
Instilled New Hope in Coach
Crayton’s Charges

The climax of Davidson’s football
schedule will occur Saturday when the
Red and Black warriors meer the Uni-
versity of N. C. in Winston-Salem, The
Wildcats will be out to prove that last
year's victory was no fluke, while on the
other hand the Blue and White will put
its strongest line-up into the play to
wrest victory from Coach Crayton’s lads.

Prospects point to a scrappy and
hard fought game. Davidson will be
facing heavier cdds, but that is such an
accustomed thing now that odds are no
terror tor the husky gridiron gladiators
from D.C. Up until Saturday the odds
were overwhelmingly in favor of the
University. Coach Campbell's aggrega-
tion won out over N. C. State, while in
turn the Raleigh lads trounced Davidson
36 to 6. This would give the Univer-
sity undisputed advantage over David-
sen. But upon looking at the dope from
another standpoint, we find that V..M.
I. snowed the Chapel Hill ream under
last week 29 to 7 on the latter’s own
field, while Davidson held the flying
Cadets to a scant 14 to 7 victory. This
would go to prove that Davidson has
more than a fighting chance against the
heavier and pcssibly more experienced
eleven from Chapel Hill. With even
breaks, it is a toss up as to the winner.

The line-up to be used against Caro-
lina on Saturday is uncertain. Davidson
was fortunate to survive the battle royal
with N.C. State, with no men on the
permanent injury list. Spann, however,
suffered a fractured nose, due to a high |

tackle made on him during the final:

Dr. Johnson’s Sermons

Student Body

Large Crowds Present at All Services—
Meetings a Great Success

The evangelistic services held by Dr.
A. §. Johnson, pastor of the First Pres-

impression on the Davidson student
body which will not be forgotten soon.
‘Starting with Tuesday night, Shearer
hall was filled morning and night for,
three days by a percentage of the stu-|
dent body which left no doubt as to the |
force and personality of the speaker. He:
made a powerful appeal to the Christian
manhood of the students, showing them
.the importance of active, rigid obedi-
ence to the high moral standards of
Christianity. He showed that it was by
the strength of Christ only that one is
able to fight successfully the temptations
that are continually besetting him. Dr.
‘Tohnson was helped in his services by
Mr. R. FE. Mell, the Y. M. C. A, secre-
tary at Rock Hill, S C., who was an ex-
cellent leader in the song services. Mr.
Met! is an enthusiastic member of the
Pocket Testament League, and as a re-
sult of his efforts a large number of the
students joined the league.

In his opening service Tuesday night
Dr. Johnson spoke on Regeneration.
Briefly. it was shown that not church
membership, not morality, not religion in
the broad sense necessarily indicated a
regenerated heart. ‘The mystery of con-
version, the new birth—inexplicable to
the human mind—is a fact that can be
substantiated by too much testimony and
the witness of too many transformed and ,
transfigured lives to be really doubted |
or questioned by honest minds. The new
birth is necessary if one would enter
the kingdom of God. The ‘address was
delivered with fervor and force out of |
the ordinary and was replete with inci-
dents and illustrations, many of them
coming out of the personal observation
or experience of the speaker,

On Wednesday, Dr. Johnson spoke on
the prodigal son, his willful breaking
away from all restraint in the exercise
of his sovereign power of choice, his
coming again to himself and return to
his father. The last thought to be de-
veloped was that God can and will make
one who desires to be so made victorious
in his turning away from a sinful life
and in his effort to build up a strong
character in righteousness and truth.
The speaker argued cogently and effect-
ively in showing that while the prodigal;

Fighting like the fierce quadrupeds
for whom they are named, the Wildcats
went down in defeat before the steam
roller of State College by a score of 36
to 6. Although handicapped by nearly
30 pounds difference in weight, the
Presbyterians were in the game with all
they had and gave their opponents a
hard battle from start to finish. In fact
it was in the last quarter of the game
that a series of brilliant forward passes

‘R. O. T. C. Battalion
Honors Charlotte With
Splendid Parade

Four Companies With Sixteen Piece
Band March Through Streets
of the Queen City

After several months of training, sev-
eral minutes of entraining and several
seconds of detraining, the Wild Cat bat-
talion arrived in the Hornets’ Nest on
the last day of last week. The recep-
tion tendered the supporters of the Red
and Black differed very materially from
that acorded one General Cornwallis
some one hundred and thirty-eight years
before and ther stay was far more
pleasant than had been that of the Red-
coat commander.

Going Down.

Assembly was sounded at 12:40 and
the four companies fell in at their ac.
customed places along Dormitory Row. -
Led by the band, the command marched
to the station, where the special train
was in waiting, After a sufficient
amount of shifting had been done to
satisfy the officials in charge of the ex-
‘tra, the battalion boarded the train. ‘he
civilian students found traveling accom.
medations .in the foremost coaca, where
the crowd was entertained by a periorm-
ance put on by Bill Miley & Co,

. Company D, in the next car, was led
in song and story by Sergeant Liston, of
the first platoon of that organization.
Lieutenant Doubles was chief of the
-execution of Davidson yells and songs
in Company C. Nothing‘can be learned
of the activities of the B delegation on
their way down, but with Price and
Brice on the rooster, it may be safely as-
sumed that the trip was not made in
gloomy silence. ‘The first initial outfit
spent the fifty-five minutes in singing,
yelling and raising thunder, according to

embarked. .
