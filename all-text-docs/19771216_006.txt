Christmas _ Gift Ideas

Faculty lists
favorite books

By Nancy McNair
Features Editor

Oh, the luxury of picking up a
book, a really good book, and reading
it for sheer enjoyment; the pleasure of
curling up before a blazing fire with a
_cup of hot cider and an intriguing
volume. Davidson professors and
staff members offered numerous sug-
gestions for holiday reading and gift
giving.,

The man who directs a library of
over 230,000 volumes, Leland Park
recommends Gifts from the Sea by
Anne Mfrow Lindbergh because it. is
‘‘good for the season— makes you
look at yourself and others.”’

J. Nicholas Burnett noted that
James Watson’s The Double Helix
would make good holiday reading. He
said it was fascinating for him to see
the personal conflict which led to the
discovery of the DNA model.

Since not everyone can be the head
of the Davidson CHemistry Depar-
tment, he added that) it is enjoyable
because ‘‘it’s not too technical.’
Burnett has also enjoyed The Hobbit,
and has just started Tolkien’s trilogy.

The Great Outdoors seems to be a
popular subject for pleasurable read-
ing. Julius Winkler, Professor of
German, named several books which
sound like fishermen’s bibles but are
actually ‘‘of wider scope. They’re not

‘how to fish’ books.’’
Among them are Trout Madness by

Robert Traver, The Best of Corey
Ford and In Defense of Worms [and
Other Angling Heresies} by Frederic
Van de Water. He also suggested A
River Runs Through It {and Other
Stories) by Norman MacLean as “A
good look at the life of loggers in
Montana.

David Shi.also suggested an out-
doorsy book, Roderick Nash’s The
Wilderness and The American Mind,

’ which presents the contrasting views
of the outdoors, the idea of resource
management versus the “‘soft, senti-
mental, nostalgic” view of the coun-
try.

He cited the fact that men had a
sudden yearning to return to the
wilderness when they were startled to
learn that ‘‘the frontier was closed’’ in
the 1890's. Frue to his field, history,
Shi named Arthur Link’s biography
of Woodrow Wilson and William
Henry Harbaugh’s. of Theodore
Roosevelt. He named Humbolt’s Gift
by Saul Bellow as well.

Randy Nelson, novitiate of the
English Department, thinks that
John DPhee is ‘‘perhaps the best
non-fiction writer in the country--al-
though he is virtually unknown in the
South.”

Anything by MPhee, particularly
The dPhee Reader or his new book on
Alaska comes highly recommended,
along with Piers Anthony's. ‘‘under-
ground classic’”’ dérophage.

To follow some light reading of
Dick Francis’ mysteries, Louise Atin,
assistant director of the N.C. Fellows
program at Davidson recommends a
rather len book entitled The
Children of Pride, a story of the
Charles Calcock Jones family from
the Savannah, Georgia area at the

id time of the Civi War...

: —— M. Jones left valuable

“

saved.”

English Department Chairman
Richard Cole recommends Galswor-
thy’s Forsyte Saga along with Robert
Grave’s novel J, Claudius. Both are
being shown on PBS.at 9 and 10 PMin
Sunday nights.

Georgianna Ziegler indicated an
interest in the historical novel with
her selections. The Golden Warrior by
Hop Mhtze was suggested to her by a
professor when she was in college.
Katherine by Agnus Eaton is the
story of the Mtress of John of Gaunt.
Becket by Shelly Mians also describes
the life of an historical figure.
Rosemary Sutcliffe’s Sword at Sunset
is one version of the Arthurian
legend.

What would Christmas be without
Charles Dickens? Gil Holland recom-
mended THe Pickwick Papers. He
also listed Miville’s Typee and A
Sportsman's Sketches by Turgenev.
The reason? ‘D‘Ade pleasure.’'

In a more serious vein, Earl

AéCormac of the Philosophy Depart-
ment lists Neil Sheehan’s The Penta-
gon Papers and The Best and the
Brightest by David Halberstams as
illustrative of ‘the divorce ‘between
facts and values in academics.’
He also lists Edward Wilson's Socio-
biology, Poetics for Sociology by
Richard Brown, and Ronnie Dugger's
Our Invaded Universities.

He_has found Jean-Paul Sartre’s

The Wall and The Trilogy appealing, ©

as well as Humphrey Carpenter's
biography of Tolkien and ‘Tolkien's

newly released The Silmarillian.
Potery writer Vorothy Sayer’s .

Gaudy Night would also-be easy val

reading, according to AéCormac.

“Annie Dillard has an incredible

capacity for seeing things,’’ said
Anthony Abbott of her book Pilgrim
at Tinker Creek. “1 was most moved
by Ordinary People...very touching..
simply written...you could sit down
and_read it straight through.

He described’ Judith Guest’s book
as the story of a family dealing with
being ordinary people after one family
member returns from a stay in a
mental institution. ee

This would be super for Abnormal
Psych,”’ he added. Another personal
favorite is Frederick Buechner’s Tel-
ling the Truth; The Gospel as
Tragedy, Comedy, and Fairy Tale,
which he uses in one of his English
courses.

In Spanish its title is Cien Anos de

Soledad;the English translation is”

One Hundred Years of Solitude. Lois
Kemp of the Spanish Department
suggested this book because it is
‘...very humorous, very tragic, a
synthesis of the Latin Rapeween
rience."” |:

The ak is ‘available in'a Pulitzer
prize-winning translation by Gregory
Rabassa.

Charles Cornwell also suggested
One Hundred Years of Solitude, as
well as Stella Gibbon’s Cold Comfort
Farm. “‘It’s funny; it’s

Despite recent rumors to the con-
trary, gambling (and especially po-

_ ker) is alive and well at-Davidson. As

a matter of fact, it’s flourishing! .
White weighing the sins of such a

damning activity at a staunch Pres-

byterian school like Davidson, may

seem impious, there are many avid

participants... y's

The brothers of Sigma Phi Epsilon ,

seem bound and determined to pro,

méte campus gambling’ to. @ level
equal in prominence to academics: ;

such as thé top of Will Terry’ s head,
Ernie Patterson,s black tie, and Zach

Long’s wolfman beard.

The Sig Ep’s recently hosted a
casino party: unprecedented this side
of Las Vegas. Apparently robbing the
bank at Mate Carlo, they auctioned off

‘€housands of dollar's worth of prizes

to Davidson’s hard core gamblers.
The most sought-after prize was

Billy Carter!
‘ The ring-leader of the horrendous
affair was none other that ‘‘Ray the
SPE”’ Berberick, currently under
investigation by the FBI for gam-
bling and the Interstate Commerce
Commission for the Coors.

Pendin, the charges against Ray,

the brothers of Sigma Alpha Epsilon

plan a similar gala occasion _in
January, complete with roulette,
craps, black jack, and stolen one-arm
bandits.

What ever happened to pool hust-
lers?

Ask C. Shaw Smith, the proprietor
of the best. pool hall in Davidson. It is
upstairs in the Student Union, and
even though you can’t drink beer
while participating in the.sport that
won millions for Mnesota Fats, this
delectible beverage is readily and
inexpensively available in the 900
Room next door. (also owned and
operated by Davidson College).

And while you're in the 900 Room,
take advantage of the entertainment.

The best intertainment if offered by -

President Spencer, ‘when he appears

by surprise, to lecture on the evils of
alcohol, gambling, shoving milk
trucks in the creek, and giving Zach
Long a shave. (Take a hint. Zach?)

Gambling is rampant in the 900

‘Room, where. it appieals to the

sophisticate in the borm of back
gammon. Mdt recently promoted by
the irreproachable Hugh Hefner,
backgammon will soon be front row
and center at Davidson.

This game of games does not take
money as its aim, but beer instead.

-Winner drink beer until you bust,

after winning beer after beer in

exponential proportionsD! .
After-all, money is not everything,
but a good brew is everything on a
slow night..Stakes are -high, as
witnessed in the continuing conflict
between Marshall Brown and Fre ©

‘Hardware’ Goodwin.

... Goors beer, second only to Pabst Bluew.:
“Ribbon in popularity. Thank-you,

At the end of fall term, Hardware
had won 64 beers from the not-so-cun-
ning Brown.

However, nothing, no nothing, will
ever replace the fine game of five card
stud. It should not be called a game,
for it is an art, an art that would make
Herb Jackson turn green with envy
for not having mastered it.

We must admit that the best five
card studs on campus are Jack
Sullivan and Stan Brown, the former
relying on true grit and the latter on
the laws of probability.

If Bruce Jackson ever discovers the
probability angle of the game, we’re
in trouble. THe Davidson poker
player of all time, though, is Bunny
Horrine, who pays her fifty dollar-a-
month phone bill as a result of her
Friday night winnings.

Her secret? She stays cold sober.

The gambler of the year is without
a doubt George Bright. It is not
known exactly what his winnings
were, but Bright, a junior, took quite
a gamble when he consumed an
unprecedented one hundred beers
during the week following Thanks-
giving break.

For sure, George is in a State of

theaksj---..., aww thar his memorable
ordeal is history.
