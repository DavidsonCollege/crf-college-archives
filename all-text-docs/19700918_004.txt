iety is the one that loses. The
big problem is that too many
tuniversities consider them-
‘selves the caretakers of soc-
dety.

“The university must look
down the road to what is
ahead; the past may offer
cherished memories, but
other than that it is invalu-
ble.”

‘Bevan did, however,. en-
‘courage sudents to work in
‘the fall election campaigns.
“T hope that faculty mem-
bers won't mind if a student
who is serious about elec-
tions wants to work in a
campaign for a week.

“I don’t believe in closing
down the college fora week,
but if some feel the elections
are more important, by golly,
they may be! I'm sure the
faculty would help the stu-
dent make up his missed
work.”

Bevan also expressed the
role which he hoped David
#0on would play in the dev-
‘lopment of its students.
‘When a man walks out of
here, I feel he should have
attained a certain level of
competence and that he
Should be a’ concerned and
sensitive human being.

“If Davidson was a con-
tributing factor in the dev
elopment of these qualities
in its students; by ‘God, we'd
thave the strongest alumni
this’ world has, yet seen.”

‘Bevan was then asked
that if he was confined to a
hospital bed for six months,
who would he want
bed: beside "him. Bevan im-*
mediately said, “‘My wife. I

‘go home at hight and unwind

in the*

wcat Llub

by talking with her. She is
a patient sounding board,
and ,a sympathetic listener
as well as a critic."

He paused for a moment
and said, “Of famous per-
sons I'd like Robert Frost
in the bed next to me be-
cause of his sensitivity and
response to individuals. Adlai
Stevenson is another possi-
bility because of his human-
ity and sensitivity. That's
pretty remarkable after
treading the path of the pol-
itician which is often a rough
and dismal route.”

Bevan was also asked
what he felt his greatest vir-
tue and weakness were. His
answer to both questions was
the same. “I get interested
and involved in many
things,”’ he said.

Spencer Predicts Current Proposals To Be Realities

For This Year’s Freshmen By Time Of Graduation

Many changes now most
sought and discussed by those
at Davfdson will become
reality for the class of 1974
according to President Sam-

uel R. Spencer Jr.
Addressing the freshmen
last Friday, Spencer « descri-

bed an era of physical, edu-

cational and social change

which had not until this time ~

been placed in the immed
iate future of the college.

Included in the projected
reforms were sonmie form of
co-education and action in the
very near future to improve
Davidson's social system with
relation to fraternities.

Spencer issued to the fresh
men a plea for involvement
in these changes bypassing
both non-involvement and
“atomizing individualism,”
He urged students to seek
local rather than exclusive-
ly distant social concerns,

First referring to the phy-
sical plant, Spencer said that
although the estimated cost
of the library-learning cen-
ter, has risen from two to
three and one-half million
dollars, architects will go
ahead with definite plans for
construction.

Also within the next four
years Spencer predicted a
new
ference center to be built on
I-77 and the renovation of the
Martin Chemistry Building.

At theie winter meeting

ed to finance football through
a smaller amount frdém the
college general fund, the re

mainder being made up
through earmarked contri-

The plan goes. into effect

from the general fund and
the rest from whatever Heck-
ard can raise. . :

Last year, the total foot

about $120,000. The new pro

The adoption of this way
of athletic financing was con-
sidered a victory for the
Wildcat Club, which lobbied
with the trustees against pro
ponents of plans to de-empha-
size football by reducing of-

ficial college financial sup
port.
Proponents of | deempha-

sis feared that the new plan
would) mean contributions
will go to football instead of
the general fund.

Davidson head coach Dave
Fagg was “elated with the
appointment,’ according to
Parker. “This is one of the
best things that has happened
since I became coach,’ Fagg
said. ‘‘The fund raising has
been on my mind a lot. Now
I can concentrate more on

coaching the football .team,”.

“I think. Davidsén needs
football very much," Heck-
ard said. “I think the solu-
tion the trustees came up

with. « . is ideal and wofk-
able. I think we can raise
the money.”
