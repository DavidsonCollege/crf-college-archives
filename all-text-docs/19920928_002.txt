on actual meals, Pritchard admit-

ted that it was difficult to tell and

therefore also impossible to re-
_ strict what was bought at lunch.

Healso admitted that the num-
ber of students eating lunch at the
Commons had dropped substan-
tially and there was greater absen-
tecism than in previous years.

As should be expected, this
year there has been a substantial
increase in the number of students
who eat in the Commons for lunch
and dinner. According to Pritchard,
lunches and dinners are up around
20%. Dinners have also seen an
increase of about 10%.

Traffic in the Union has de-
creased by around 10% this year
and cash is off at the Union by
10%.

The Bonus Bucks system
gives students extra money to spend
on meals. at the four dining loca-
tions on campus during the semes-
ter. Students.may not spend their
Bonus Bucks at the Laundry or for
items bought at the Bookstore.

Students on the 19 meal plan
receive $100 worth of Bonus
Bucks, 14-meal plan students re-
ceive $90, and 10-meal plan stu-
dents receive $80. The drawback
is thatstudents may no longer count
breakfast or lunch at the Union or

lunchat Bakeras one of their meals.

for the week. Therefore, they may
only use Bonus Bucks forany meals
at these locations. Correspond-
ingly, the number of meals on their
meal plan can only be used at the
Commons.

Pritchard did not solicit any
Davidson students’ opinions when
he decided to initiate this new pro-
gram, aside from only a dozen stu-
dents he talked to on campus this
past summer. He said that he re-
ceived no negative feedback from
those students. Pritchard did re-
search other colleges and universi-
ties to determine what kinds of
meal plan systems worked best.

He studied programs at places
such as Vanderbilt, Western Ken-
tucky, Kentucky, Tennessee and
Richmond. When asked why he
didn’t look at schools closer to
Davidson’s size,. Pritchard said,
“Most schools our size have more
rigorous control over their meal
plans.” He said that such schools
also don’t have four food service
systems ora declining balance pro-
gram. He cited Wofford as an
example saying that they have only
a 21 meal plan.

Currently there are 466 stu-
dents on the 19-meal plan, 181 on
the 14 meal plan, and 163 on the

10-meal plan.

Pritchard said that he has al-
lowed eight students to eat lunch at
the Union because of work or class
conflicts that they have had. He
also said that he has noticed that
this new system has caused a prob-
lem for students who eat at a house
or off-campus who might have
bought a 10-meal plan to use for
lunch in the Union.

He said, “Obviously, I need to
make some adjustment. I just want
to make sure, when I change that
again, I do what’s right for every-
body, the fair thing.” Healso added
that Auxiliary Servicesmighteven
come up with an entirely new meal
plan for next term.

Price departed from the nor-
mal address given by convocation
speakers by not delivering an ac-
tual speech. Hé instead read po-
etry and commented on the vari-
ous poems that he chose to read to
the Davidson audience.

Price read the poems with ease
ina beautiful voice which kept the
audience in silenceas he seemed to
succeed in being able to touch ev-
eryone personally. He spoke with
confidence and eloquence, mixing
humor with his personal inputabout

~ the poems several times through-

out the talk,

He described the poems that
he chose as ones “‘that have been
important to me at various stages
of my life.” Price said that he was
firstintroduced to poetry atan early
age and, although he can’t remem-
ber the name of the first poem read
to him, he can remember the dis-
tinct sound of poems being read
aloud.

Price said that he was taught
to learn and memorize long pieces
of verse when he was young and it
has helped him several times when
he was alone.

_ The first poem he read was
originally in German and he trans-
lated the verses_having not ever
spoken ‘or even been taught Ger-
man. The short poem was entitled
“Initiation.” He followed this up

with a poem entitled “Great Son-
net of God’s Grandeur."

Price then read a sonnet writ-
ten by John Milton on that poet’s
blindness. He said that many have
read this poem as one that helps
them through times of sorrow or
despair, but Price said of it, “I think
its one of the scariest poems ever
written.”

After reading the sonnet by
Milton, Price read a poem entitled
“On My Own” by Phillip Levine.
He said that this humorous poem
was one Of his favorites.

Price then read a poem on the
meditation of Shakespeare’s Tem-
pest by W.H. Auden. He said that
Auden was “perhaps the most-
skilled poet of the English lan-
guage aside from Tennyson.”

He continued his exceptional
reading with a poem by John Keats
which ended with the line “I hold it
to you.” Price commented, “I hold
it to you, isn’t that what poetry is
all about? Isn’t that what human
life should be about?”

Price finished his reading with
apoem of his own entitled “Hymn.”
He related the story of how he had
written this prayer for James Tay-
lor to perform at an ordination.
Taylorhas now recorded thisand it
is set to be released on an upcom-
ing album.

After finishing his readings
Price said, “[Everyone should]
spend at least a quarter of an hour
every day réading poetry aloud.
What you willaccomplish... is that
you will be a wiser, better, more
loving mate for all those you touch
as you proceed through whatever
time is allotted you.” ’

Upon the completion of the
speech, Kuykendall and Interim

sented Reynolds Price with an hon-
orary degree naming him Doctor
of Letters.
