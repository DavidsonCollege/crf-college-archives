Dr. J. M. Wells Speaks to
Student Organizations

President of Columbia Theological
Seminary

Visits Davidson and
Conducts Student Services. .

Dr. J. M. Wells, president of Colum-
bia Theological Seminary, taking his text
from I Cor. 16:13, gave a short and in-
teresting address on the subject, “Quit
You Like Men,” before the Y. M. C. A.
last Sunday. During his two-day stay
at Davidson he also filled the pulpit of
the Presbyterian Church twice, and ad-
dressed the Volunteer and Ministerial
Bands, besides holding 25 15-minute 1n-
terviews with students concerning future
work and training.

In beginning his “Y” address he ex-
plained why the Corinthian Church
needed the advice “Quit you like men”
Corinth, with its world of work, business
and commerce among all races and
classes of people under all conditions,
was a city of great vileness and corrup-
tion, and such advice as Paul gave was
sorely needed.

Just what do the words “Quit you like
men,” mean? Doctor Wells explained
them to mean the conquering of lower
instincts and impulses, and attaining vic-
tory over self. The essential element of
success in the world is not “pull,” but
manhood. The man who is not a creature
of his own weaknesses, but attains vic-
tory over self, is the one who succeeds.
The world admires true manhood.

Every one has a certain tendency to
grow in accordance with his surround-
ings. But the true man is the one who
dominates world environments, and by
honest toil and strenuous effort over-
comes and rises above instincts to let
fleshly lusts and desires dominate. The
higher instincts must dominate if the
all-important victory is to be achieved.

Subduing self is no easy thing. Life
is a struggle. Outside help must be sum-
moned. But when this outside help, Jesus
Christ, is secured, there is no limit to
cne’s attainment. “I can do all things
through Christ whagstrengtheneth me.”

Arnet Gamble conducted the service,
and Ted Jones led the singing. A violin
solo by W. S. Buchanan was enjoyed,
‘while Graham White and Wallace Purdy
also contributed towards the success of
the music. E. B. McGukin closed the
service with a prayer.

Ministerial Band.

The Ministerial Band met Sunday at
1:45 p. m. in Shearer Hall. Dr. J. M.
Wells spoke on the subject, “The Duty
of Obedience.”

The meeting was opened by a song,
followed by sentence prayers. After a
few words of introduction- by Frank
Johnson, Doctor Wells spoke. He took
for his text parts of verses 26 and 27
of the eighth chapter of Acts, which say:
“And the angel of the Lord spake unto

CHEMISTRY DEPARTMENT
OFFERS THREE NEW COURSES

The Chemistry Department of David-
son College, for the year 1922-23, is of-
fering three new courses, ‘embracing
Physical, Inorganic, and Agricultural
Chemistry.

The course in Physical Chemistry will
be elective to those students who have
already had two years of College Chem-
istry. The theoretical rather than the
practical aspect of Physical Chemistry
will be taught; theories of gases and col-
loidal suspensions will be among the
subjects discussed.

Advanced Inorganic Chemistry will be
open to students who wish to do further
work in that field of chemistry. Special
methods of analysis of steel, milk, water,
gas, and other substances will be em-
phasized.:

Agricultural Chemistry is a practical
course which includes a discussion upon
that side of chemistry which affects the
farmer. It will be open to the men who
have had two years of chemistry. -

REPORTERS CLUB NAMES NEW
OFFICERS FOR COMING YEAR

At the meeting of the Davidsonian Re-
porters’ Club held last Friday night, the
officers for the 1922-23 year were elected.
W. vP. Brown was elected as: the new
president of the club and after several
close ballots were taken R. H. Smith
was elected vice-president, ‘and C. V.
4rown, secretary and treasurer. Each
of these men have well proved their
ability along the reportorial line and
they well deserve the offices to which
they have been elected.

These men are to be installed at the
next meeting of the club. The present
officers, Rolston Bitzer, president; Geo.
Mauze, vice-president, and Henry Mor-
ris, secretary and treasurer, who have
so successfully guided the work of the
club during the past-year, retire with
this issue of the paper.

Wake Forest Game.

Coach Hengeveld is feeling much better,
thank you. In fact, all the little Henge-
velds are feeling better. Coach took his
family out for an outing on Sprunt Field
Monday, and after cavorting and other-
wise disporting themselves on the dia-
mond two hours and 23° minutes
by a daylight saving clock, every one of
the 800 spectators agreed that they
had seen a game that sizzled, bubbled,
avd finally boiled over. The Wake For-

est ball tossers, with five fresh scalps of

North Carolina colleges dangling at their
belts, their playmates, but the:
Wildcats handed them the short end of
a 5-4 score.

The game rocked along for five in-
nings in a scoreless manner. Although
Boushee had yielded four hits, nd two
came in the inning. Davidson's
first hit came in the fifth when McLeod
poked a haymaker to left but Hunkie was
left stranded on the hot corner.

In the sixth the game took on a live-
lier aspect. Wake scored once
on a two-base hit and three errors. More
tallies for the were prevented
only by Crawford’s sensational work—
but more of that anon. The Wildcats
also scored in their half of the sixth
when Freeman walked and registered
on the welcome mat Luke
double. :

A single, double, tgiple and two errors
produced two runs for. Wake Forest in
the seventh. But Boushee then clamped
down on the visitors and with airtight
support held the visitors scoreless dur-
ing the remainder of the game. The
Wildcats got busy, however, and one of
them chugged his. way around the entire
circuit during each of the
innings,

In the seventh, McMillan singled, took
second on McLeod’s bingle, went to the
hot corner on a wild pitch and tallied
on Brown's bounder. Crawford follow-
ed him over the rubber in the next round
on a double to right, a passed ball, and
Pritchett’s drive to center.

Brown checked in with the tying
counter in) the ninth stanza. He clash-
ed a single to left and continued on to
the half-way station when Albritton let
the ball get away from him. Boushee
advanced him a peg with an infield out
and he scampered home on Mace Erwin’s
safety to left.

The winning tally came in the tenth.
Wake Forest threatened in their half;
