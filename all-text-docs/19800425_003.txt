Football and money—No easy solutions to the pr

By ELIZABETH KISS

Davidson football had its
first winning season since 1969
this year, finishing with a 6-4
record.

It also cost the College
$250,000.

Many have raised the ques-
tion of whether the results
produced by the football pro-
gram are commensurate with
the costs, and several options
have been touted as foolproof
solutions to the football ‘‘prob-
lem.” Among these are chang-
ing the athletic affiliation, drop-
‘ping to NCAA Division II or
Division III, or cutting football
altogether. None of these op-
tions are simple.

NAIA not palatable

Traditionally, Davidson has
been a member of the National
Collegiate Athletics Association
(NCAA). Since there are not
many NCAA schools in the
area,scheduling is expensive.
Games more than six hours
away require air travel, which
costs $10-15,000 per game.
Next year the team must fly to
three games, according to Head
Football Coach Ed Farrell.

Travel costs could be reduced
by joining the National Associ-
ation of Intercollegiate Athlet-
ics (NAIA), which has several
member schools in the Carolinas
comparable in size to Davidson,
such as Elon, Catawba, Wof-
ford, Guilford, and Lenoir-
Rhyne. However, NAIA mem-
bership is not ‘“‘palatable’’ to
most people at Davidson, Inter-
collegiate Athletic Advisory
Council Chairman David Shi
said. NAIA regulations include
unlimited scholarships, try-
outs, and a six month transfer
rule. Davidson gives no football
scholarships, espouses a philo-
sophy of ‘everyone plays if they
want. to,’’ and disapproves of
rhe school-hopping allowed. by
the six month rule. Most im-
portantly, Shi added, “‘the gen-
eral image.of the NAIA is of
schools of lower academic

Division II impractical

Davidson has the option of
changing divisions within the
NCAA. Football is not among
the 12 varsity sports which
must remain in Division I -in
order for the college to maintain
Division I status. According to
Athletic Director Thom Cart-
mill, the main factor in choosing
a division is not money, but
“‘who you can play.”

In 1977, the football program
dropped from Division I to
Division II for a year. Many of
Davidson’s traditional oppo-
nents, such as Lehigh, Lafay-
ette, and Bucknell, did the
same. Then, in'1978, the NCAA
established Division I-AA.
Davidson, along with the Penn-
sylvania schools, joined the new
division. Division I schools may
award 90 athletic scholarships;
Division I-AA, 75. However,
since Davidson offers no foot-
ball scholarships, the reason for
the move was.to be in the same
division as most of its oppo-
nents, Cartmill said. This year,
only 3 of 10 games were against
Division I-AA opponents, and
Davidson’s record was 1-2 a-
gainst them. ‘‘In the’future the
NCAA will require a certain
percentage of our games to be in
the I-AA division,’ Shi said,
‘Our scheduling is therefore
going to become more diffi-
cult.”

Although Davidson did play
in Division II for one year, the
division is no longer ‘‘compat-
ible’’ according to Cartmill,
because there are very few
Division II teams in the South-
east. There is a slight possibil-
ity that Davidson will be forced
to join Division II. Division
I-AA must have 45 members by
January 1981, or it will be
discontinued by the NCAA. It
now has 43, according to Far-
rell. ‘‘If there’s no Division
I-AA, then we’re Division II,
along with Lehigh and Bucknell
and the others,” he said.

division is no longer ‘“‘compat-

along with Lehigh and Bucknell
and the others,’’ he said.
Division III:

Being discussed informally

A switch to Division III is
the most frequently raised al-
ternative. Trustee Athletic
Committee Chairman Perrin
Anderson stressed that such a
switch ‘‘has never been pro-
posed formally to the Trustees.
It is being discussed informally
among them.’’ Shi said esti-

_ mates of the amount saved by

dropping to Division III range
from $50,000 to $150,000.
Reductions in actual opera-
tional costs would be ‘‘very
little,” according to’ Anderson.
They would consist, Shi said, of
a decrease in recruiting costs
and less wear and tear on
equipment, since Division III
teams do not have spring
practice, Discontinuation of

, spring practice would not affect

insurance costs “significantly,”
Business Manager Robert Cur-
rie said, because, as part of the
athletic budget cut, students’
personal policies will now cover
most insurance costs. Nor
would travel costs decrease,
Cartmill said, since there are no
Division III teams in North or
South Carolina.
Coaching Reduction:
A Possibility

Cutting the coaching staff
could create a more substantial
savings, Farrell said. The foot-
ball team now has one head
coach and five assistants. Since
there is no minimum for Divi-
sion II coaching staff specified
by the NCAA, Shi said, the
amount saved in this area would
depend on ‘‘how austere we
want to go.’’ Cartmill said,

“You've got to have at least a
total of four coaches even for
Division III.’’ There would
probably be more ‘‘doubling
up” in sports among the coach-
ing staff, Cartmill added, since
there would be no spring -prac-
tice and it is difficult to hire
coaches on a half-year basis.
This would ‘‘penalize our spring
minor sports even more,” he
added. There are now two
assistant football coaches
coaching minor sports, Bob
Estock, in wrestling, and Steve
Frank in women’s track.
Wildcat Club Funds:
Key to Savings

Any real savings from joining
Division III would be ‘‘contin-
gent upon the Wildcat Club,”
according to Anderson. Since
1970 the Wildcat Club has
subsidized the football program
by paying for the loan and work

study portion of the Admissions
Office. financial aid package
offered to football players. Last
year, this subsidy amounted to
$107,500. If Davidson dropped
to Division III, the Wildcat
Club could no longer give this
subsidy. The College would not
have to pay most of the loan
and work study funds, College
President Samuel Spencer said,
since they are covered by feder-
al aid. The college work study
program finances work study
salaries, while the National
Direct Student Loan and Guar-
anteed Loan programs are more
“attractive” than Davidson’s
lodn program, according to
Assistant Director of Admis-
sions and Financial Aid Kath-
leen Stevenson. This $107,000,
then, could be used for other
sports. «

The question, Farrell said, is
whether the Wildcat Club funds
would remain constant. ‘‘I
think it’s certain,’’ Anderson
said, ‘‘that some of those funds
would not be given.’’ Wildcat
Club Executive Director Sandy
Carnegie agreed. ‘‘I think: (go-
ing to Division ITI) would have
a devastating effect on most
areas of giving.’’ Carnegie
pointed out that 66% of those
who give over $1000 to the
Wildcat Club give to the Living
Endowment as well.

One financial loss would de-
finitely result from switching to
Division III, Shi said. As a
Division IAA team, Davidson
football shares the Southern

_ Conferences television reven-

ues. This’ year, the team re-
ceived $40,000.

Cartmill said reducing the
football program could endan-
ger Davidson’s Southern Con-
ference status, although there
was “no precedent” for a team
being dropped from the Confer-
ence for poor performance. ‘‘If
we changed football and didn’t
tamper with minor sports,” Shi

said, ‘it would probably not
affect our conference member-
ship.”

Playing in Division III was
called ‘‘organized intramural
