Court houses fail sanitation inspection

Unofficial study looks at NC health statutes

By William Robert

Fortunately for Davidson fra-
ternities and eating houses, Patter-
son Court does not have to comply
with the state laws concerning sani-
tation in foodhandling establish-
ments,

If they were evaluated accord-
ing to the cleanliness standards all
other establisments in the state must
meet, most of them would lose
their permits-to-serve-food.

Patterson Court houses are
classified as establishments that
both provide lodging and serve
food to house members. As such,
they are exempt from being graded
quarterly by sanitation inspectors
from the North Carolina Depart-
ment of Environmental Health.

Only Rusk House would pass
an official inspection of this sort,

Sexuality:
FLAG,

forums, &
policies

By Ashlyn Dannelly
In the fall of 1991, student
attempts to create a Davidson chap-

ter of Friends of Lesbians and Gays
(FLAG) met with equal amounts

of opposi-

support
from students and parents. Two
years later, in 1993, the college’s
nondiscrimination policy was
- changed to state: “Davidson Col-
lege admits qualified students and
administers all education and em-
ployment activities without dis-
crimination because of sexual ori-
entation, race, color, religion, na-
tional origin, age, disability, or sex
except where exemption is appro-
priate and allowed by law.”

This apparent change in the
attitudes of the general Davidson
population has been catalyzed al-
most entirely by student-led ef-
forts.

The sexuality forum.

Meg Jones’93, night manager
of the college Union, was the first
openly homosexual student at
Davidson College and helped the
FLAG chapter obtain its SGA char-
ter. Jones came out publicly in the
spring of 1993 at the annual FLAG-

sponsored forum discussing sexu- |

ality issues.

See FLAG on page 4

and only then with a "C" rating.
The scores, according to the
department’s 1000-point grading
system based on 1 6criteria, ranged
from 644 to 737 for the houses.
Any establishment scoring less
than 700 points fails the inspec-
tion. A 900 point score earns an
"A" rating.

A typical meal at one of these
houses involves taking a plastic
plate, cup,-and- silverware from
stacks of each and serving oneself
from food set out on a table in the
middle of the dining room. After
eating, one scrapes the food left on
his plate into a designated garbage
can and leaves the plate, cup, and
utensils in a stack in the kitchen for
student dishwashers to wash in the
sink after the meal.

While this provides a general

overview of the norm, there are a
few variations. Kappa Sigma of-
ten uses paper plates, which are
thrown away at the end of the meal.
Rusk House has labeled bins, one
each for plates, cups, and silver-
ware. Students in charge of
dishwashing at Pi Kappa Alpha
are the ones who collect the plates,
cups, and utensils.

According to Section 2618 of .

North Carolina General Statute
130A-249, none of these practices
is considered sanitary. It states
that “all . . . eating and drinking
utensils shall be thoroughly
washed, rinsed, and subjected to
an approved bactericidal treatment
after each usage.”

The statute goes on to say that
“the supply of eating and drinking
utensil shall be of sufficient quan-

tity to allow washing, rinsing, sani-
tizing and air-drying before re-
use.” This measure is routinely.
violated by both Kappa Sigma and
Pi Kappa Alpha, where silverware
shortages sometimes force students
either to eat their meals with spoons
or to reuse dirty forks.

Even President Kuykendall roasted Dean Terry at his barbecue and square dance Friday

“I’m still the Dean, and ev-
erybody can still be suspended!”
spoke Dean Will Terry, laughing,
before his farewell party this past
Friday. Free food, dancing, and
the sounds of an outdoor band
brought the campus together to
celebrate and show their thanks
for the retiring Dean of Students.

The “Celebration 22 Years
in the Making” began with a free
dinner for students, faculty, and
staff on the Chambers lawn. The
‘Commons provided barbecue,
garden burgers, and other picnic
fixings.

Bidding Dean Terry farewell

After dinner, a panel com-
prised of students Bill Gullan, Tim
Sobon, Chris Edmonston, and
Wendy McHugh roasted Dean
Terry. President Kuykendall and
the Dean himself also contributed
witty anecdotes from past and
present. In response to many ques-
tions as to what Dean Terry will do
in his retirement, he said, "I'm go-
ing to raise a lot of hell. Next year,
I can party with you on the court."

"| hope that I have encouraged
students in ways that make them
better people," said Terry. "You've
become my family."

After the roast, party guests

gathered for square dancing called
by Dean Terry. The music con-
tinued later Friday evening with
yet another visit from.the band
Everything.

The party evolved under the
direction of student planners with
the cooperation and sponsorship
of the Union Board, Patterson
Court Council, and SGA.

Sophomore Cristie Corn said
of the party, “I think it says a lot

goodbye to someone who has

Regarding the cleansing of

results suggest that the voters were
looking for experienced candi-
dates. All junior and sophomore
senators who ran for re-election
won. ‘Rising Senior Class Presi-

dent B.J. Rudell looks at the suc-

cess of the returning senators as a
signal that they are taking their job
seriously.

Along with Rudell, Gautam
Srinivasan returns as a senator for
the class of 1995, and Chad Lloyd
changes from Sig Ep senator to
class senator. The class of 1996 re-
elected Bo Bartholomew as presi-
dent with Nick Troiano and Theo
Curey filling the other two senato-
rial spots.

Warren Buford will serve as
rising sophomore class president.
After two days of closely contested
run-offs, David Wick and Nicola
Hartery also became rising sopho-
more class senators. The Honor
Council representatives for the
class of 1997 are Ann Hatfield,
Allen Marshall, and Macon Stokes.

Rudell says the high number
of returning senators will “enable
the SGA to pick up where it left
off” and not have to go through a
long transitional period. Some of
what Rudell hopes to work for in
the coming year are improvements
in the infirmary, a satisfactory out-
door basketball court, and a Stu-
