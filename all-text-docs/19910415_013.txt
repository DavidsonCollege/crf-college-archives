Men's Tennis Rolls
Toward Tournament

By Robert Grubb
The men’s tennis season
continued to improve their play
as they looks forward to the Big
SouthTournament next weekend.
Victories over William and Mary
and UNCC improved to a 15-13
record overall for the year.

Davidson defeated William
and Mary 5-4, as Kurtis Zabell and
John Beyer pulled together to win
the third set of their number one
doubles match to clinch the vic-
tory. Zabell and Beyer lost the
second set, but rallied to win the
third set 6-1. The two had not been
playing well lately, but the win
helped to restore some of ‘their
confidence.

In a rematch of a Davidson
victory in the fall season, Davidson
again defeated UNCC 5-2.
Davidson led 4-2 after the singles,
with Albie Varoski picking up a
victory at number one singles.
Varoski then teamed up with David
Jespersen for.a straight-set victory
at number three doubles to finish

the match. The other two doubles
matches were cancelled in prog-
ress.

Davidson ran into a much
tougher opponent in old Southern
Conference rival East Tennessee
State. The Wildcats did much bet-
ter than they had hoped, losing 5-2.

“They area tough team, witha
lot of good foreign players in the
top of their lineup,” said coach Jeff
Frank. “Their number one player
is ranked in the top 25 in the coun-
try in singles.”

Dave Tonidandel and Russell
Briggs picked up Davidson’s two
singles victories to extend the
match into doubles play.

“We thought going in that they
would probably beat us in the
singles,” said Zabell. “I was sur-
prised to only be down 4-2 after the
singles.”

The Wildcats face UNC-G ina
home match today and hope to
avenge last year’s loss. They then
travel to Augusta next weekend to
play in the Big South tournament.

Heads For Big South
Tournament

By Larry Dagenhart

With a 5-1 record in the con-
ference, the Davidson women’s
tennis team will go into next week’s
Big South tournament as the sec-
ond seed. As of Friday, the Wild-
cats have won their last eight
matches in a row, including recent
victories against Winthrop (9-0),

_ Radford (6-3), UNC-Asheville (9-

0) and a 7-2 decision over UNC-
Greensboro. A dy

Inthe Winthrop match; thekey,
according to coach Caroline Price,
was “concentration and an ability
to focus.” Freshmen. Cyndi Hess

and Jennifer Beahm sparkled as
usual. Hess was able to demolish
her opponent, 6-2,6-1,and Beahm
sported a nice comeback in the
second set of her match. After fall-
ing behind 5-4, she was able to win
7-5 and prevent a third set.

The Radford match was espe-
cially pleasing to Price. The Cats
were able to sweep the singles from
the defending Big South champi-
ons in just 45 minutes. The only
sour note was that Davidson lost
all three doubles, leaving Price with
“mixed emotions.”

field, most of Davidson’s players
will be seeded atnumbers one, two
or three in singles and in doubles.
“The momentum from our Spring
Break play as well as our good
record in the conference has guar-
anteed this situation,” said Price.
“We’ve had a very successful
season and I think we’ re well posi-
tioned for aconference champion-
ship”.

One of the reasons for this
favorable position going into the
Big South tournament has been the
outstanding play of doubles team
Mary Beth and Tasha Ruth. “They
requested to play together and I
thought it would be fun,” said Price.
“They’re very easy to coach be-
cause the chemistry is (already)
there,” she said. Mary Beth and
Tasha currently sport a 15-4
doubles record and will have the
number one seed at the Big South
tournament.

“I love playing with my sis-
ter,” said Tasha. “We’ve grown up
playing together and that’s why
it’s worked so well. Our games
really complementeach other,” she
added.

Mary Bcthalsohad good things
to say about their doubles-playing
success.“She [Tasha] has a-very
upbeat personality,” she said of
her sister. “Her powerful and ag-
gressive game hasadded many new
dimensions to my own game and
has strengthened it considerably.“

Coach Price is excited about
her best Division I team ever and
its position for the tournament. She
said, “We’ll open the can of balls,
and when the smoke clears, we’ll
look up at the scoreboard.”

at 10:45.

Sitek once again broke loose, »

running 11:02, her best by almost
20 seconds. Senior Laurie Reams
also fought her way to a personal
best at 11:10.

Men's Track Perse-
veres at Duke Invita-

tional Meet

By Peter Hurtado

The men’strack and field team
arrived Friday at the Duke Invita-
tional in search of several school
records. Instead, the Wildcats
found miserably wet conditions at
Wallace Wade Stadium and re-
turned home with several gutsy
and impressive efforts, but no
Davidson records. __

The action began Friday eve-
ning with the 5000m run, where
sophomore Ian Stewart worked
hard for a phenomenal time of
15:27.4;Ian wentout strong for the
first 3000m and held on tobecome,

Davidson’s 4th best all time in the _

5000m. Junior Ted Richardson
followed Stewart-at 15:43.2.
Later Friday evening, senior

John Moss raced with a fastcorps ~

of 10,000m runners, running a
34:09.6 in the grueling 25-lap race.

Moss is now 10th on the all-time
Davidson list.

Saturday’s wet and cool
weather made for horrid condi-
tions for most field events and
jumps. Rob King (38' 11 1/2") and
Rafael Candelario (35' 7 1/4") put
forth strong efforts for the Wild-
cats in the shot put, while Steve

- Waters hurleda wet discus 108'4".

Paul Levengood handled the jave-
lin well, throwing 145' 2".

In the long and triple jumps,
the ‘wet conditions hampered the
normally outstanding perform-
ances of freshmen Will Presson
and D.J. Ruggles. No official
measurements were recorded.

David Kerns led the way for

the Wildcats in the 3000m steeple- -

chase, running a fine time of 9:42
to become the 3rd best all-time for
Davidson. Senior Moss followed

at 10:11 and Richard Wharton ran a
personal best 10:31 onthe wet track,

Just following the steeplechase ©

brought the sparse crowd to its feet:

as he led the field by 100. meters
after going through the half at 2:02.
Hurtado (4:11) held on until just
before the finish where he fell and
got up to finish alongside teamate
Cam Dauler (4:12).

In the final event for the Wild-
cats, the dynamic duo of Duncan
Spears (56.9) and David Stewart
(58.1) blazed to personal besttimes
in the 400m hurdles. Spears' fine
performance rates him as
Davidson’s 4th fastest in the event,
while Stewart's is 9th all time.

Though records did not fall this
weekend at Duke for the Wildcats,
Coaches Andrew and Manson had
to be pleased with the determina-
tion and effort of their squad under
the poor conditions.

Come out and cheer for the
Wildcats this Saturday as they host
the Southern Invitational against
Big South teams in their final
competition this spring.

By Bruce Page

Davidson football is spending
the spring preparing to match last
year’s first-rate performance. Last
fall the Wildcats went 6-3, record-
ing their first winning season in 11
years, and head coach Dave Fagg
is optimistic about the team’s
chances for another successful
season.

NCAA rules do not allow
Division III programs to hold offi-
cial spring practice, but Davidson
is working very hard on what Fagg
calls a “player development pro-
gram.” Football players are en-
couraged to continue to develop
themselves in the off-season ath-
letically and. personally. Many
players participate in a condition-
ing class to improve strength and
skill, and all players are active ina
coach-mentor program designed
to help players in academic, per-

-| sonal and spiritual growth.

Davidson loses 11 seniors to
graduation thisspring, allof whom,
according to Fagg, were valuable
contributors in terms of playing
time and leadership. Fagg, in an
interview with The Davidsonian,
spoke highly of the seniors’ loy-
alty and unselfishness, and con-
fided that “they meant so much to
me.” Perhaps Fagg’s greatest chal-
lenge lies in attempting to replace

For Fall Season

that dedicated group.

Last year’s recruiting efforts
brought 35 players to training
camp, 27 of whom remain on the |
squad. Although this year’s recruit-
ing season will not end until May
15, when prospective freshmen
notify Davidson of their college
plans, Fagg says it looks as if the
team will get 30-35 players from
the class of 1995. Fagg hopes the
incoming freshmen class develops
as rapidly as last year’s class did;
certainly they will be called on to
contribute immediately, asa group
of just 10 seniors will lead next
year’s Wildcats. i

The divisional status of the
program is still up in the air. Foot-
ball is distinct from other sports at
Davidson in that it plays at the
Division III level, independent of
conference affiliation. With all of
the changes presently occurring in
the NCAA, a variety of possibili-

ies exists. A likely scenario is
‘classification in the not yet estab-

lished Division I-AAA, signifying
a Division I sports program witha
Division III football team.

Coach Fagg says his dream is
that one day when people think of
Davidson thay will think not only
of a great college, ‘but also of a
