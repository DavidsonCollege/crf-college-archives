Spoon River Anthology

Drama Spectacle Attempts Theatrics

A Review

By FRANCES TOWNSEND
News Editor

Of late, the Thespian efforts
of Director Rupert Barber
and the Davidson Drama
Department have demon-
strated a diStinct fondness for
the nurture and indulgence of
a creature sometimes called
‘‘Theatrics’’, or “The
Theatrical Effect.’’

As anyone who has ever -

seen both a well and a poorly
conceived dramatic produc-
tion knows, fhere is but a fine
line between theater, and
theatrics. And a successful
piece of stage-work will nor-
mally (and hopefully) have a
little of both.

The well-schooled critic
however, should im-
mediately pounce on such a
statement and add that there
is no practical separation of
such aspects of the drama,
and that therefore such a
distinction is artificial and
meaningless.

The well-schooled critic is,
of course, right. Theater and
theatrics (the erstwhile
Aristotelian would probably
say Language and Spectacle)
are concepts which are, for
practical purposes, __in-

istingui in a whole.

It is only when one becomes
of glaring predominance, that
the presence (or lack) of the
other is felt at all. And un-
fortunately, the Drama
Department’s production of
Edgar Lee Master’s group of
poems, “Spoon River An-
thology,”” in many respects
reflects an obvious tendency

towards the theatrical.

The production declares it-
self to be an entertainment
with music. Since this is a
vague sobriquet at best, and
since it becomes difficult to
talk at any length about an en-
tity which claims only to be
entertainment, for the
moment I will operate under
the assumption that the show
wascalled a poetry reading,
with music and dance (which
in fact it is).

There are a number of
disturbing factors connected
with the execution of the
poetry reading. One is the
issue of the costuming.

The characters in Master’s
poems all communicate ther
life stories as they see them
from beyond the grave. Appr-
priately enough, it would
seem, they are clothed in
burial garb. Each of the
costumes for the male actors
are specific, quaintly styled
suits while all the female ac-
tors but one are clad alike.

However, at odds with the
specificity of the costuming, is
the circumstance that while
there are 40 some roles por-
trayed in the group of poems,
there are only on fourth that
many actors.

The idea that each of the ac-
tors represents a number of
different characters is ob-
scured by the specificity of the
dress.

Certainly the costuming is
attractive on an absolute
scale, but it is inappropriate to
the show, and becomes both

How much more effective
the poetry would have been,

DRAMATIC CRUCIFIXION

had there been a generalized
costume for the male mem-

bers of the company ‘and one
for the females.

Another annoying tendency
present was the forced in-
teraction of the actors on the
stage. In a reading of this sort,
where actors do not play

specific parts, and there is no
plot structure which demands

specific presences on stage
other than those of the actors
addressing the audience,

beset upon from all sides.

His best friend, a kettle drum player,

“The Tall Blonde Man
With One Black Shoe”

“The Tall Blonde Man with One Black
Shoe” is a professional violinist who is

production, involves the love triangle as
their symphony gives a concert.

The husband has just found out about
his wife’s infidelity and is seething. The

glances to her

relationships between charc-
ters suggested by scenes such
as the danceat the end of Act I
are wholly confusing and

superfluous.

Finally, the garbling of
speeches through overly rapid
delivery or undue histrionics
is totally reprehensible.
Poems are not series of words,
or sentences or thoughts: they
are the words themselves, and
the loss of one work con-
stitutes the loss of the whole

poem.

Through all of the in-
coherence manifested in
Spoon River Anthology
however, a number of momen-
ts shone bright. The singing
and acting of Patsy Arnold
and the instrumental talent
and voice of Rick Gentry were
a delightful surprise.

Also, the _—_. performances
of many actors unknown to the

Instead of developing toward a
