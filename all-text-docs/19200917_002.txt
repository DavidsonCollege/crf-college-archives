Gleanings From Athletic Columns
Show Good Prospects for All
Davidson’s Opponents

N. C. State.

Coach Bill Fetzer’s gridiron war-
riors at N. C. State are now out in
full force, numbering some 50 or
more. The prospects seem bright
and enthusiasm runs high up in the
Red and White camp. With all of
last year’s team back, except two
linesmen, the Tech eleven this year
should be expected to turn in an-
other good card when the season is
over. Of the veterans to return
are in the backfield, Faucett, Gur-
ley, Pierson and probably Murray,
even though he is property of the
Yankee baseball nine. In the line
are Kirkpatrick at end, Weathers
and Ripple at tackles, Floyd at
guard. Johnnie Johnson, former
Wildcat star, is also out. The Tech
schedule includes Davidson, Navy,
Georgetown, Penn. State, Carolina,
V. M. 1., William and Mary, V. P. L,
Wofford, and Wake Forest.

Georgia’ Tech.

From the Golden Tornado strong-
hold down in the Cracker State,
comes the news that eve thing is
rosy, concerning another champion-
ship eleven. Practice began the
first of last week, and reports sa
that Grant field is the scene of muc
haste to and fro, as the 70 odd pig-
skin chasers go to their task. Of
last year’s Varsity squad, four will
be missing. Pup Phillips, Ham
Dowling, Shorty Guill and big Huf-
fines, star tackle for two years.
Familiar faces back this year in-
clude Geiche, McDonough, Mayer,
Lebey, Webb, Ferst, Staton, Amis,
Barron, Granger, McRae, Lyman,
and last but not least, “Buck” Flow-
ers, youthful star, who used to per-
form on the Red and Black machine
of °17.

Wake Forest.

The Baptists are out. in. full
strength this year and are hard at
work, getting in shape for the open-
ing fray on September 25, when they
tun into the Golden Tornado of
Georgia Tech at Atlanta. Coach
White has the candidates, who num-
ber upwards of 40, working hard
and expects to turn out a sturdy
team. Those who are showing up
to a good advantage are Heckman,
Johnston, Pravatt, Smith, at end;

ierce, Blackshear, Lee, at tackle;
Moss, Brundy, Johnston, Molman,
at guard; Taylor, Wall, Knight, at
center; Rabenhorst, Fulton, Arm-
strong, Jennette, Benton, Matthews
and Williams, in the backfield.

Richmond College.

Practice began in the Spider camp
on the 13th. This may be a bad
omen and it may not, but from all
accounts prospects are indeed
bright. By the way, it is not Rich-
mond College any longer, but the
University of Richmond, if you
please. ith an enlarged schedule,
it is a necessity that some , hard
licks be put in. Only two men of
last year’s Varsity squad will be
lost, Kidd at center, and Shepherd
at guard. Those to return in the
backfield are Ziegler, Spencer,
Snead, Jones and Blankenship. In
the line, Captain Broaddus, Carter,
Price, Klevesahl and Robins will re-

turn. \

on Monday, the 6th. The early bird
catches the worm—maybe? Pros-
pects are bright with 10 letter men
as a nucleus back, around which to
build a fighting team. Marion E.
Fuller, formerly of West Virginia,
is heatl coach and assisted by Clay
Wyatt, former quarterback of the
same place, the two are whipping
the line and backfield respectively
into shape. Captain Harrell, star
tackle for past three years, is back
and seems as good as ever. Other
veterans include Pritchard, Jacobi,
Lowe, Pharr, Griffith, Abernathy,
Tenny, Cochrance and Spaugh.
Many new men are out and last
year’s scrubs are putting up a game
fight for first string berths.

University of S. C.

The Gamecocks opened up last
week with 30 men answering Coach
Metzer’s call for football candidates.

wide reputation; Brockington and
Smith, ends; Thomas and Marion,
guards; Blout at half, Timmons at
quarter, Brady, Waite and Lightsey,
