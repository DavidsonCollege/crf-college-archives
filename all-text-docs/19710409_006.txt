Flat Hat Under Fire

Dr. Davis Paschall, President of William and
Mary College, has established a committee to con-
sider the future of the school newspaper, “The Flat
Hat,” in the wake of three formal complaints that
the newspaper had violated concepts of good taste, al-
legedly using the word “shit” twice in print and
vfuck” once.

This action was taken despite the board’s campus
publications committee recommendation that no ac-
tion be taken against the paper. One possible alter-
native would be that the college would no longer be
the legal publisher, ‘giving the editors full financial
and editorial responsibility.

Rally For Victory Planned

‘The Emory Wheel” reports that organizers
under the leadership of Bob Spencer of Atlanta are
planning a March 20 march on_ the. State capi-
tal in Atianta under the theme of ‘Victory over Com-
munism.” Spencer said, “This gathering of concern-
ed citizens will demonstrate to our government lead-
ers and the world that there are many people in the
United States who. believe in victory, both spiritual
and military.” This march is apparently intended to
counterbalance the effect of the May Day Offensive.

Money Pinch Felt :

“tue Vanderfbilt Hustler” has reported that while
applicants for the Freshman Class are “among the best
ever ... the shortage of available scholarship funds
will prove an insurmountable obstacle for many stu-
dents otherwise qualified to enter the University.”

This pinch was felt most acutely by black appli-
cants who needed financial aid. Only 99 blacks have
applied so far this year as opposed to 140 who sought
enurance to the University last year.

Curriculum Innovations

Kaculty, students and administrators are present-
ly discussing an ‘‘experimental college” at Emory Uni-
versity, “The Emory Wheel” has reported. ‘Essentially,
participants in an experiment in education would have
to work harder because they would have to create
their own academy structures.”

“A number of options are being discussed, in-
cluding a learning environment in which students
and faculty would meet on an informal basis, study-
ing living and socializing together.”

Black President Elected _ ' :

On Friday, March 26 Harry Walker was elect-
ed President of the student body of the University of
South Carolina, the first black ever to win that office,
according to “The Gamecocks.” He destroyed.all o
position, beating his nearest opponent by the margin
of 2,038 to 807.

Skeptics had said that it would snow in the spring
before a black student body president would be
chosen. Ironically, Walker was elected and then it
snot, several hours after he made his acceptance
speech.

Co-ed Interest Declines

Only seven students, two
of them male, have decided
to attend Davidson next year
under the Eight College
Exchange
was announced this week.

According to Jay UH.
Ostwalt, director of educa-
tional development, the
number is much smaller than
had originally been expected
at Davidson.

“‘We don't know why the
number is so small. We think
that probably it’s because
Davidson's isolated from the
girls in the participating
Virginia schools.”’

This year 10 women came
to Davidson from Mary Bald-
win, Hollins, Sweetbriar, and

exchange. Two of the co-ed
exchange students | stayed
for only the fall term.

Ostwalt. said that he felt
communication failures are
at fault for the apparent de-
cline in intérest in Davidson.

“We're inclined to think
that it’s a general lack of
information concerning the
program and the school. The
girls here this year haven't
had the opportunity to talk
about the program to others
at their home schools.”

will attend Davidson next

Struggle

With Universities

For a private liberal arts
college to survive in the face
of rising competition from
state - supported schodls, it
must make its educational
product more attractive to
potential students, President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr. said
in Monmouth, Ill., Wednes-
day.

Spencer spoke at an Honors
Convocation at Monmouth
College on the Spic, ‘‘Who
Will Buy?’’ Monmouth, like
Davidson, is a private liberal
arts college.

“The liberal arts college
has built-in antidotes to many
of the standard complaints
of students,’’ Spencer pointed
out. “The most frequent
complaints’ are  imperson
ality, preoccupation with
graduate students, poor
teaching, irrelevance and
non-commitment.”’

The antidotes of private
liberal arts colleges, he con-:
tinued, include their size,
their residential nature and
sense of community, their
emphasis: on the_ under-
graduate, their emphasis on
teaching, and theiy tradition
of commitment to values.

“To capitalize on these as-
sets,’’ Spencer suggested that
teachers ought. to be chosen
for their ‘‘enthusiasm for

teaching, a concern for peo-

ple in general and students
in particular, and sa sense of

institution.”’

Spencer added ‘that an in-
centive system for teachers
that would be based on good
teaching instead of good re-
search might be helpful in
greating an atmosphere con-
ducive to quality teaching.

Selecting students on the
basis of potential contribu-
tions to the college commun-
iy in addition to the regular

academic requirements is
important also, Spencer
added.

Spencer recommended that °

academic programs. have to
go beyond “‘reshuffling’’ to
true reform, even to the
point of questioning the pre-
sent importance ‘of credit and
combining the senior year of
high school and the fresh-
man year of college.

Instead of ‘‘going a-whor-
ing’’ by imitating big uni-
versities, small colleges must
take advantage of their as-
sets by justifying ‘‘education
on grounds well beyond its
utilitarian value,"’ he = con-
cluded.

include Sandra May, Linda
Lueders, Jennet Robinson,
and Emily Marie Ferrara.
Barbara Blackwood of Hol-
lins is the other woman in
the program.

Two men from Hampden-
Sydney, Ray ‘Mettetal and
Ralph Charles Hess, will
also attend Davidson . under
the exchange program.

Ten Davidson students will
attend Hollins next year
under the program. Five
students from Davidson are
presently studying at Hollins.

Ostwalt pointed out that
Davidson has established a
similar program with Queens
which will be conducted next
vear. The same provisions of
the Eight College Exchange
Program will be in effect in
the exchange with Queens.

According to Ostwalt, ad-
ministrative ‘details are still
being worked out for the
Queens exchange, but the
program should be open for
applications soon.

Besides the Queens ex:
change, Ostwalt pointed to
the fact that Davidson is ac-
cepting late applications from
coed exchangees. ‘We're
doing everything possible to
make our co-ed exchange
program work» We're willing
to help in any way that we
can."

Ostwalt said that some of
the other’ schools participat-
ing in the exchange program
have been faced with a
greater lack of interest than
Davidson. Only Washington
& Lee had more applicants
under the program, as over
20 women from Hollins ap-
plied there. Thirteen women

had originally applied to
Davidson.
Ostwalt, although disap

pointed, did not feel that the
program is in any trouble.
“We're hoping to get better
exposure for the program
next year. One year can’t
give a good indication of the
success of such a program.
Next year at this time we
will have something to go
on when we evaluate the
program.”’
