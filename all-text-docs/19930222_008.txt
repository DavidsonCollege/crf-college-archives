Flick Review... "Tibetan Monks Chant to Packed 900 Room
Visit Marks Close of South Asia Week as Solidarity Week Begins

The Crying
Game Fails
to Deliver

By Scott McLean

The maxim “curiosity killed
the cat” comes to mind when I
recount my excitement in last
week’ s issue about seeing the much
talked about film “The Crying
Game.” Well, all I’ve got to say is
that it’s a good thing this cat had a
couple of lives on reserve. Irish
writer-director Neil Jordan’s ro-
mantic thriller failed to deliver the
goods as far as I’m concerned,
although it just nabbed six Acad-
emy Award nominations and at the
moment is the darling of Holly-
wood. It just goes to show that this
North Carolina boy may be further
from Hollywood than he thought—
not that that’s a bad thing.

The story starts off in Ireland
where a band of IRA radicals kid-
naps a British officer (Forest
Whitaker) in an attempt to bargain
for the freedom of one of their
leaders who has just been cap-
tured. This group includes the
slinky Jude (Miranda Richardson,
Best Supporting Actress nominee
for “Damage”) and the good-na-
tured Fergus (Stephen Rea, Best
Actor nominee). Fergus befriends
Whitaker’s character and when
their secret camp is raided by the
British army, a bedraggled Fergus
escapes to London to make good
on the promise he made to watch
after his captive’s girlfriend, Dil
(Jaye Davidson, Best Supporting
Actor nominee). This one is really
hard to summarize because the plot
twists are so wild you can’t say
anything without giving something
away, SoI’ll stop while I’m ahead.
However, it is safe for me to say
that Fergus discovers that things
aren’t always as they appear to be
and that he can’t escape his past.

Rea is good in his role as a
“bad guy” trying to make things
right, and so is, to acertain degree,
Davidson, as the very enigmatic
Dil. The standout, however, was
Miranda Richardson and she de-
served a nomination for her work
in this film as well. All three‘of the
features she has made this year
have garnered at least one nomina-
tion apiece (“Game,” “Damage,”
and “Enchanted April”) and she is
poised, along with fellow Brit
Emma Thompson, for major star-
dom. I don’t know exactly where
this film rubbed my rhubarb the
wrong way given all the talent
present: maybe it was too artsy or
maybe it was too British. Who
knows? TI do know that you prob-
ably will not be able to guess the
ending (‘Entertainment Weekly”
says only 10% of the audience is
able to do so). You will be some-
what entertained by the plot twists,
and the haunting title song might
catch your fancy, but whether you
enjoy the work as a whole or not
will in the end be purely based on
individual Preference.. ream

Heads turned at Davidson
College last Monday night as a
dozen men with shaved heads clad
in red drapes called “draches”
walked about campus, murmuring
quietly amongst themselves. What
most curious passers-by probably
did not know is that the clan was a
group of monks from Tibet on an

eight-month tour of the United
States. The Buddhist visitors gave
a presentation in the 900 Room
intended to heighten awareness of
the plight of their homeland. Many
Tibetans, including these monks,
have been living in exile since
China’s invasion of Tibet in the
1950s.

-Cheme Tsering, spokesman

for the group, introduced the mem-
bers of the Gaden Monastery to a
full house. The monks sat cross-
legged on the stage with bowed
heads. Incense and several tapes-
tries lent an appropriate South
Asian air to the presentation.
Tsering first explained the basic
philosophy of his monastery: They
believe that the two things which

Davidson Outdoors
to Offer Spring

Break Alternatives
Water Trips Provide Adventure

By Rachel Newcomb

Over the week of March 13-
19, Davidson Outdoors will spon-
sor two alternatives to the tradi-
tional Spring Break destinations.
The two trips offered area four day
beginner whitewater kayaking
course and a canoeing expedition
through the Florida Everglades.

The whitewater kayaking
course is offered in conjunction
with the Nantahala Outdoor Cen-
ter. Located near the edge of the
Great Smoky Mountains, the
Nantahala Outdoor Center is the
leader in whitewater instruction.
The trip departs on March 19 from
Davidson and no experience is nec-
essary for participation. Instruc-
tion beginsona lake and progresses
to more exciting streams as the
week continues. All equipment is

provided, and the price is $250 per-

person.

Davidson student Alexia Gre-
gory participated in this kayaking
course during the fall. “‘It’s a good
way to get solid kayaking experi-
ence,” she offers, “They teach you
basically everything you need to

7 nO. about t paddling ar and d rolling

the kayak.” Students,sleep at a
campsite and, Gregory added, the
NOC is close enough to civiliza-
tion that a store and restaurant are
nearby. “If you love water sports,
it’s a wonderful opportunity,” she
says.

Additionally, Davidson Out-
doors will be taking a group of
students to the Florida Everglades
National Park fora week. Depart-

ing from Everglades City, students -

will paddle through mangroves and
out into the Ten Thousand Islands
area in the Gulf of Mexico. Once
in the Gulf, they will canoe from
island to island and camp on the

beach at night. “The Everglades ~

are amazing,” says Lissa Mowris,
who went on this trip two years
ago. She mentioned that she saw
dolphins, eagles and manatees at
very close range. “You're right
out on the ocean, and it’s very
isolated. The Gulf sunsets are es-
pecially beautiful. It’s an incred-
ible experience.” The canoeing
trip costs $175.

ther of these two trips, call

really matter in life are acquiring
knowledge and using this knowl-
edge with wisdom and maturity.
Peace, says Tsering, is up to the
individual. Time doés not actually
change; human beings change and
experience the illusion of change.

The Tibetan monks have held
this philosophy close to their hearts
and have thus been able to tolerate
China’s presence in Tibet with an
amazingly peaceful state of mind.
The majority of their monasteries
have been destroyed, targeted as
symbols of Tibetan culture by the
Chinese. But, says Tsering, exter-
nal factors are notalways the cause
of problems. He claims that the
true source of happiness lies within
the individual, that we are the navi-
gators of our own lives.

Part of the Buddhists’ reli-
gious ritual includes chanting,
which was demonstrated by one of
the monks. The monks must train
for twoto three years to acquire the
chanting voice, and to some it never
comes. The chanting voice was an
amazing, almost non-human
sound. It consisted of a series of
low, vibrating starts and stops with
interspersed humming.

The monks have been living
in India with their spiritual leader,
the Dalai Lama, since 1959. Thou-
sands of Tibetans have crossed the
Himalayas into North India to take
refuge with the Dalai Lama, whois
