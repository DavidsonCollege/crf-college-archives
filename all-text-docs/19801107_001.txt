Spencer calls for global vision

Spencer said in an interview
Tuesday that the changes he

‘proposes would mean increasing

the faculty *‘above the 100 num-
ber,”’ which is its present limit.
There would be ‘inevitably a re-

“Auction of the [student-frenitv)

ratio.” (This ratio is now offic-
ially 13:1.) However, Spencer.
said if more students enroll in
foreign study programs, the.
College:will be.able to increase
overall enrollment since a large
number of students will always
be off campus.
' His speech was ‘not spark-
ed by the EPC proposals,”’
Spencer said. EPC Chairman
Price Zimmermann added that
the RPC sees no ‘‘incongru-
ence between its report and the
President's cemments.”

Because demand for Humani-
ties among this year’s freshman
class “far out-ran the supply of
places, ” Spencer said, “‘change
is essential.”

There are two pobisible solu-
tions:to the problem of exces-

sive student demand, ‘Spencer —

explained: to make the program
“selective on a basis which is
clearly understood: by and: de-
fensible to’ incoming students”
or “to expand the program to
meet the demand,”

Spencer proposed expatision .

because Humanities is, “‘quite
obviously, a drawing:card ‘for
students’ of high quality.”

To expand the program, ‘‘we
will have to get more staff,”
Spencer said dn an interview
Tuesday.

There could be a rearrangement
of class loads in other depart-
ments if in the future almost all
incoming freshmen elect to take
Humanities, he added.

Expanding the program
would involve a long-term com-
mitment comparable to the
College’ 8 commitment to a
