The thinly clads will inaugurate their campaign when

cisioned this aggregation in a close dual meet last year

by a 68-62 count.

However, Maryville went on to down

the University of Tennessee and cop state laurels, so the
Whittlemen may expect a good deal of competition again

this year.

On the next three successive Saturdays the

Wildcat tracksters face Southern Conference foes; they
