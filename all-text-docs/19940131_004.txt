~ VAX Scandal

Computer services officials
declare electronic
chain letters illegal.

By Jeff Fuller

Chain letters distributed
through the VAX are officially rec-
ognized as illegal at Davidson.
Operators of Apollo, the academic
host computer known as the VAX,
have recently taken measures to
prevent the circulation of chain
letters.

A warning forbidding chain
letters was placed on the introduc-
tory scroll which appears when-
ever users “log in” to the com-
puter. The warning states that dis-
tributing chain letters is in viola-
tion of the user agreement which
must be signed before opening a
VAX account.

Computer chain letters, like
chain letters often sent through the
mail, request the recipient to send
a letter on to a specified number of
addresses.

E-mail facilitates the circula-
tion of chain letters because it is
quick and cost-free. Unlike many
chain letters, none of the those on
the VAX are known to have asked

for money.

However quick and cost-free
the chain letters may be, they still
create problems within the system,
according to Marc Overcash, the
Help Desk Manager at the com-
puter Services Center.

Overcash, who finds chain let-

ters “infuriating” also remarks on ~

the length of the chain letters. He
explains that the headers on the
letters increase in size every time
the chain letteris forwarded. When
forwarded into an account, the large
chain letters have the ability to
damage one’s account if the letter
takes up too much space. The long
letters also jam up the “Internet
highway.”

Dan Duncan, who works as a
student assistant and at the help
desk in the computer lab, says “the
problem is when a letter like that is
forwarded, it gums up the works.”

Internet, a worldwide com-
puter information network, links
hundreds and thousands of “do-
mains” which can be governmen-

for free, and provide
shipping service.

tal, commercial, or educational.
When large chain letters are sent
through the system, services can
be disrupted.

Geoff Nash, Systems Pro-
grammer, says that “opportunity
cost” is lost when large letters in-
terfere with the network and slow
it down.

Since chain letters are in vio-
lation of the policy statement, dis-
tributors of chain letters now risk
the loss of their accounts if caught.
Overcash notes that chain letters
are “not only illegal at Davidson,
some other networks say chain let-
ters are illegal.” —

The discovery of one of the
chain letters came to Nash’s atten-
tion when he was telephoned by a
person at Indiana University who
complained of a chain letter which
originated at Davidson. The only
way the chain letter senders can be
caught is if someone complains to
the computer center or if the letter
is sent to one of the people who
work at the center.

Although students are warned

about what they send through the
VAX, the computer center work-
ers assure students that no one will
search their accounts for chain Iet-
ters. “We have better things to. do
than look through people’s mail,”
states Overcash.

He says only two or three
people who actually run the sys-
tem itself have the ability to read
mail. Nash, one of the these people,
declares “I have never looked in an
account; we have so many impor-
tant things to do, we don’t have

time for a witch hunt.”

Although Overcash is over-
joyed with the demise of the chain
letters at Davidson, he admits that

‘ some letters have been “rather hu-

morous,” pointing to one letter
which threatened disastrous events
to those who did not distribute
copies as instructed.

Duncan refers to another “in-
teresting” letter which described
“how to boost your sex life.” They
suspect some students, at least, will
lament the loss of the chain letter.

more progressive in things and
open-minded and have better ide-
als of inclusiveness. The way todo
this is working on things like the
Statement of Purpose and the state-
ment about Trustees as active mem-

‘bers of the Christian church, but
still maintain the general theme
that Davidson is associated with
the Christian church, obviously
affiliated with the Presbyterian
Church and that still plays a strong
role, but you have to be careful that
that isn’t so strong that it is going
to exclude people that would con-
tribute to the Davidson commu-
nity and you do this by the host of
reforms introduced by the SGA
and are now under examination by
the Trustees is a good way to start
with that. Other ways to continue
in that progressive-type direction
are items such as co-ed dorms
which I think should be legislated
but be legislated as an option where
freshmen have an option to do that
because there are some people who
have strong Christian ideals would
find that it would conflict with
their ideals and to maybe give
people the option but that would
ensure progressive reform, let’s say
reforms that bring the two sexes
together so there is more positive
interaction and along with the sexes
there has to be more positive inter-
action between minority students
and the students of different reli-
gious affiliations with the majority
of the students.

“Another way to legislate pro-
gressive reform, and this may be
one of the most important things, is
to narrow the gap between the
Trustees who really embody the
former ideals of the strong Chris-
tian stance and bring them closer
to the students and faculty who are
over here which have a more pro-
gressive mind-frame. I have some

" very good ideas of how to do this.

“I’ve done a little bit of-re-

search and called Davidson alumni.

the “young Trustee program”
where students from the student
body would have more active in-
put with the Trustees. There is an
obvious need for this and it seems
like something that could be done.
I think I would have the courage to
stand up to Trustees who usually

“seem to be--not to bad-mouth the |
Trustees--to be less receptive to ~

student opinion and. the.only per-
son who can typically give student
opinion in a policy-making situa-
tion is the SGA president. The
SGA presidenthas tohave the cour-
age to do that. With these types of
reforms, with a young Trustee pro-
gram, students would have more
involvement with the Trustees who
maintain the more status situation
of so-called conservatism and less
progressivism.”

Tied to that but a little more
specific is—what is your stand
on the proposed changes to the
Statement of Purpose and the
policy requiring that Trustees
are Christian? If elected, how
would you address these issues?

“I think these are changes that
have been necessary to make at
Davidson for along time, and Iam
glad that Alden had the courage to
take them up. If I were elected
president, I guarantee that I would
continue to pursue the completion
of these reforms. Right now the
Trustees have formed an ad hoc
committee to look at the active
member of the Christian church
stance. The Executive Committee
has started to make changes and
has actually issueda change for the
Statement of Purpose. These things
have yet to be completed. One of
my major campaign promises will
be to continue the pursuit of these
things because I feel it is definite
for a more whole Davidson com-
munity and a better overall cam-
pus relationship with the Trustees
and the students and attracting dif-
ferent kinds of students that will
make Davidson more successful to

~ complete these reforms.

“The majority of the busy-
work has been done by the past
administration. But the toughest
thing now is to stand up and not let
the Trustees, not to say that the
Trustees are going to try to slide
something, not to let the issues
slide by, it’s going to take a strong
leader to keep the issu¢s in focus

“and I thinkas presidentofthe SGA,

I could keep the vision at eye and
what I think the students want for
Davidson in focus.”

What do you predict will be
Davidson’s challenge in 1994?
“T think Davidson’s biggest
challenge will be to incorporate
the new Dean of Students into the
life of Davidson. I would like to
see the new Dean of Students be an
advocate for the students, some-
one who is not afraid of standing
up for the students’ rights and
needs. And someone who, like
Dean Terry, has been very per-
sonal with everyone and knows so
many people on a personal basis
and can maintain a good personal
relationship with everyone. . . .
More than the Dean of Students
itself, is the whole idea of the
Davidson hierarchy, so to speak,
with the Trustees, the faculty, and
the administration, because there’s
definitely a gap between the stu-
dents and the faculty, which I would
like to fix so that academic matters
aren’t the only relationship that the
students have with them, so that
the relationship with the students
and the administration is different
which is embodied in the Dean of
Students, would be more close,
and then the gap between the stu-
dentsand the Trusteesis alsoclosed
with reforms that I have mentioned.
There is a gap and it gets continu-
ally larger as you goup.... I think
by starting at the bottom with the
faculty and the new Dean of Stu-
dents can bridge the gap between
that, then we can eventually work
our way up to the Trustees and
eventually work for the betterment

~_ of the entire society.”
