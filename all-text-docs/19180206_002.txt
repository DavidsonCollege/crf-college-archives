When it comes to the Sophs making
the Honor Roll they are where Moses
was when the light went out--in the
dark. But we pay our compliments to
the one who made the highest mark in
college. He finds time for Davinson-
IAN and Magazine work, debating and
other college activities. We wish that
he might have some classmates with him.

USEFUL INFORMATION TO SENIORS AND
ALUMNI.

Doubtless many of our readers know
something of the United States Employ-
ment Service, that branch of our Na-
tional Government operating some eigh-
ty-five public (free) employment offices
thruout the United States. We believe,
however, that very few know that at
one of these offices, that at Chicago, Hl.
a section has been set apart for the sole
benefit of professional men and women,
known as the Teachers and Professional
Service Division. Thru this division the
Government endeavors to find suitable
positions for teachers and professional
engineers (draftsmen, civil, mechanical.
electrical engineers, chemists, metallur-
gists, etc.), and suitable persons for
school officers and employers needing
such help. In a few words, this division
is a Teachers’ and Engineering Agency,
operated by the United States Govern-
ment.

Dr. P. B. Prentis, Acting Director of
Employment for Illinois, under whose
jurisdiction this division is operated, re-
ports that during the past year it has
been found impossible to find enough
teachers to supply the need, and many at-
tractive positions throughout the United
States have been unfilled for this reason.
It has frequently happened. however,
that immediately after a position had
been reported filled thru other sources,
a suitable candidate would effect regis-

Ihe DAVIDSONIAN, February 6, 1918

tration. Of course it was then too lat
to nominate’ the teacher for that par
ticular position. Dr. Prentis earnestly
hopes that such occasions may be quite
infrequent during the 1918-19 appoint-
ment season. ‘Ihis can only be accom-
plished by every available teacher being
registered in the division before the open-
ing of the appointment season. We
therefore suggest that if you expect to
be available for a new position for the
next year that you write Dr. Prentis im-
mediately for a registration blank. Then,
when the appointment season opens in
April or May, your record will be com-
plete and the division may be able to
nominate you for the first suitable po-
sition reported. Registration in the
Teachers’ and Professional Service Di-
vision will also benefit you in other ways
for, should you learn of a position for
which you would like to apply thru any
other source, the division will, if asked,
send copies of your confidential record to
the school officer to whom application is
made.

What has been said above in regard to
teachers applies with equal force to the
other professions cared for by this di-
vision. Altho this phase of the work was
not commenced until October, 1917, the
demand for mechanical engineers, design-
ers, draftsmen, chemists and metallur-
gists has been far greater than the sup-
ply. To our Seniors we say, “Tf you are
preparing for any branch of the engi-
necring profession, register with the di-
vision as soon as possible.” To our.
alumni we say, “Tf you are dissatisfied
with your present position, write to Dr.
Prentis at once for a registration blank.
The division has some very attractive
positions listed, and it may be possible
for you to secure one of these.

Any communications intended for this
division should be addressed: ‘Teachers’
and Professional Service Division, U.S.
Frployment Service, 845 South Wabash
Avenue, Chicago. TL.” = Applicants for
registration should indicate the kind of
work desired so that the proper blank
mav be sent. It will be a convenience
to the division if you will enclose with
your letter a self-addressed leant size
(a'408Y.) envelope with a three cent
stamp affixed.

SOLDIER AND

SAILOR INSURANCE]-

In a shore time a million checks a
month will be issued from the Bureau of
War-Risk Insurance to the families of
the men constituting America’s fighting
force.

‘There had been up to January 18
1918, 473.116 applications for total in-
surance of $4,.011,391,000. The average
amount applied for still keeps near the
maximum of $10,000. A steady effort
is being made to make our fighting
forces “100 per cent insured,” and there
are many military units in which every
member is insured and in some of them
every man insured for the maximum of
$10,000.

The automatic insurance granted by
the law ceases on February 12, but by
that time it is hoped that our whole mili-
tary and naval forces will be “100 per
cent insured,” with the result that the
family or dependents of everyone having
a family or anyone dependent on him
will be provided with a monthly allow-
ance, and insurance in case of his death.
and the member himself, if disabled, will
receive a monthly allowance, and if to-
tally disabled, will receive in addition
rehabilitation and special education and
training to fit him for some work.

The efforts of the Treasury Depart-
ment to have every member of the mili-
tary and naval forces insured under this
law can be greatly assisted by the people
at home of the soldiers and sailors if they
will join in urging them to take out the
insurance offered.

LOCAL PASTOR ADDRESSES
MINISTERIAL BAND

Last Sunday the Ministerial Band
vas addressed by Rev. Mr. Jenkins, pas-
or of the Methodist Church of David-
on. He spoke on the subject, “The
Minister and His Wife.” ‘The speaker
irged that every ministerial student
hould marry by all) means when he
chould complete his education. Every
‘ninister should be particular in choosing
a helpmeet with a good heart, soul and
mind. A minister’s wife should be physi-
‘ally strong, well trained, well educated.
and above all endowed with common
sense and a willingness to work.

The speaker stated that the minister's
wife should not accompany him in mak-
ing calls, because the people want to talk
over their troubles with the minister,
and the wife would prevent them from
doing so. He further stated that the
wife should take an active part in all
church work, but that she should not
take a leading position, The minister
should dress his wife just as well as him-
self or as any of his members.

He also called to the attention of the
band that if a pastor cared for his peo-
ple, that they would care for him, and
that in proportion to the number of

prominent young men of our country. |

the largest per cent has come from the
minister's home. ,

SOMF ADVANTAGES OF
THE SMALL COLLEGE

While admitting the place of the large
technical and professional schools and the
imiversities, those who have had experi-
ence with both large and small colleges

| feel strongly the advantages of the small

college in town or country over the large
city colleges. The following are among
the advantages which will appeal direct-
ly to a student who contemplates a col-
lege course as a basis for professional or
technical studies:

First, as to the matter of expense,
since this is the question that presents
itself first to many students as a condi-
lion of college education. The expense
of a college education at a small college
is less by a third (we are assured by
come, by a half) than the expense of such
an education in the city colleges.

Secondly, the small college has for
the serious student this great advantage
—an easy access to the professor both in
his own home and at college. At the
large colleges the classes are large and
the professors live often miles away, so
that, as those who have attended the
large colleges know well enough, the
personal relation between professor and
student at the minimum. What casy
access to the professor means in the way
of stimulus, and actual help. those who
have experiences can well appreciate.

Thirdly, in the small college in town
or country the distractionsy social and
other, are less, and a student can give
himself more easily and steadily to his
work.

Fourthly, the student who goes as a
stranger to college will establish himself
much more quickly in the friendship and
activities of the small college than he
could in those of the large cities —The
Missionary Survey.
