the service-if they had a better oppor-
tunity to participate in it.

Perhaps this is a minor detail, but
the minor details are entities which total
“a better Davidson.”

Sympathy
The Davidsonian wishes to express

sympathy to Al and Herb Dimmock and
to Ivey Stewart in the recent losses
in their families.

attendance is certainly small enough

generous gift.

. Commendation

Dr. Cunningham is to be commended
on his plans for the celebration of
Mothers’ Day week-end on the campus.
Such a program will not only permit
students to accord the customary hon-
ors to their mothers, but will allow the
parents to get a first hand idea of the
education for which they are paying.

It is hoped that a large number of
the mothers will find it possible to at-
tend. Such an idea is worth the effort
necessary to make it a tradition. May
it receive the-success it desérves,
