Lovette Cut ICF Discs

During 14 Month Tour

By LEONARD RICHARDSON
Davidsonian Feature Editor

The International Communications Foundation is at-
tempting to acquaint Americans with Yugoslavia, Iran,

Turkey, Pakistan, and Afghanistan by compiling a col-
orful series of sound slide-films to illustrate different
aspects of these cultures. Jim Lovette who graduated
from Davidson in January, travelled 14 months with the

ICF as sound technician.

From the summer of 1957 to
the fall of 1958, Lovette jour-
neyed through Europe and Asia
to record the music and ‘typi-
cal’ sounds of five little-known
countries.

These recordings supplement
the hundreds of photographs
taken by the ICF staff for the
sound and film-strip kits dis-
played in the College Union
lounge this week.

PRIVATE GROUP

The International Communi-
cations Foundation is a non-
profit, private educational and
cultural organization headed by

| Lawrence Van Mourick, Jr. of
| Los Angeles State College.

| The ICF is working toward
promoting international under-

standing by probing into the
history and contemporary life
of nations abroad and creating
pictoral and sound representa-
tions of the way of life of the
people whose cultures are most
removed from the normal frame
of reference of the average
American.

According to Lovette, the ICF
took form in 1957 when a group
of experts on international mat-
ters received a grant from the
Mary H. Babcock Foundation for
ICF.

for the board was passed by a
vote of five to four after a
lengthy debate among council
members.

NEW PROBLEMS

Those who opposed the board
argued that it was superfluous
and that there was danger in
placing too much power in the
hands of a very few students.
There was also fear that prob-
lems would arise concerning
which court or board would try
a specific case.

Some of the opposition also
felt that this distinguishing be-
tween an honor offense and the
breaking of a regulation would
do serious damage to the hon-
or system and to the prestige of
the Honor Court and that it
would even more seriously de-
tract from the influence of the
regulations.

The proposers of the board
meanwhile argued that it would
enhance, rather than damage,
the prestige of the honor sys-
tem. They also contended that
by putting the power of enforce-
ment in the hands of students
who served on the Student
Council, that there would be a
more active and more effective
enforcement of regulations. as

HANDBOOK EDITOR

The council also took action
providing for the transfer of
The Wildcat Handbook from the
YMCA. It passed a resolution
that the editor of the handbook
be elected by the student body,
after nominations had been
made by the Publications Board.

An alternate proposal, which!
provided for the appointment of
the editor by the Publications
Board and a council member,
was defeated by a vote of four
to three.
