The Ice Man Cometh; C.A.
and Y.B. have seen a vision and
a half!

Where were you when the
lights went out, turkeys, (nerds
for you, Dr. Q.). Man we caught
the blow between Belk and
Chambers listening to the tum-
bling pines crush waylaid Pin-
tos.

And lo there it be, shining like
the mythical star that hovered
over Nazareth, Bethlehem or
Cornelius, one of those small
Mideastern towns, the light that
lunched a thousand freshmen,
the eternal flame of Humes, the
torch of Abbo.

From. the farthest reaches of
the labyrinthes of the Castle
Chambers there came an eerie
light surrounded only by the
pure black of total night. (For
you science majors, this means
the only light on campus came
from Abbo’s office). .

The night had been a hard
one. The surface of the moon, a

negative of daylight lit a
million sets of spider webs.

What was it Hollywood had
told me? Two special sauces,
onions, pickles, cheese and a
couple of buns, sesame seeds, I
think.

It was a strange night, and

the lights have gone out on cam-
pus, and the only light on was
Abbo’s. We decided to in-
vestigate.

Young Buck expressed sin-
cere apprehension, recalling his
earlier experiences. As he suc-
cinctly put it, ‘“‘We don’t know
what we’re getting our rosy red
rears into.”’

Maybe Hollywood told me
about the fear that is struck in
the heart of elephants when

Young Buck discusses his sex’

life. Young Buck had implied in-
vestigating the light from Ab-
bo’s office was tantamount to

gambling our gonads. Regar-:

dless, we surged on.

our size 13 Converse ankle-
breakers, across the slush we

moved towards the sinister
example of Neo-Chalmers
Davidson-Grit-Architecture,
the House of Chambers, where
the feared Dread One Abbo
stirred.

As we entered the large en-
trapment which by day in-
nocently posed as a front door,
we detected the smell of freshly
graded philosophy papers. The
stench was so unholy C.A.
puked cookies to relieve the
pungent odor.

As we moved on down the
seemingly endless corridors,
the odor vanished, leaving only
the ominous twinges and creaks
of leather against flesh which
C.A. recognized from his recen-
tly completed perverted road
trip.

“C.A.,” said Y.B., “I ain’t up
to messing with...with...that
thing.

C.A. calmly replied, ‘But
he’s here; and he’s alone, and
after all, we’ll kick him if he
gets smart.”’

As we turned the last (and
first) corner, we heard hideous
cackling.

C.A. said the blunt approach
was the only. way to do it. ‘“‘Act
like we were just. walking
through.”

“Oh, sure,’’ said Y.B. ‘‘We
are always just walking
through this library rat-infested
building.”

Well, C.A. turned and suavely
made his presence. known.
“How they hanging Abbo?’’

Abbo quickly turned, stunned
for an instant, but almost im-

mediately began to roar with in-
sane laughter.

“‘You’re too late, you
sniveling fools. I’m finished, I
can’t be stopped.”’

‘“‘Hey, Abbo,’’ continued

E.A.”” Have you seen Stan
Boskovich around? Me and
Witz have been looking for him
for about a week.”

“Cease your senseless prat-
tle, dolts,’’ Abbo cried.

“Hey, C.A., this turkey is trip-
ping. Look at his walls,’’ war-
ned Y.B.

Y.B. was right, which was
rare in itself. Along the walls
were reflections of a man who
had lost his grip on reality. The
walls were covered with past
humanity papers, and all of
them were failures. One was in

a gold case labelled, ‘Jeff -

Hallman, -8.”’

C.A. ;
“And I gave him ten points,”
chuckled Abbo.
We also. noticed ‘an

autographed picture of Socrates
which said, “To Abbo, my

. favorite child disciple.”’

If that doesn’t strike you as
odd, there were four foot screws
laying around with names on
them.

“Holy rectum,” said Young
Buck. “‘He’s got a four foot
screwdriver on his desk.’’

“T thought it was Stan
Boskovich,”’ mumbled C.A.

“Don’t you want to hear my
devious plan, fools?’’ snapped
Abbo.

Well rats! Don’t you want to
know what the child disciple has
in store for yourselves? Not this
week, Charlie.

Can’t you see that four foot
screw heading for you, We gon-
na pick this up next week
although it will be tough to get
in this mental state (to use the
term loosely) again.

Tune in next week to find out
why Abbo’s light is the only one
on. What’s he doing? What did
Hollywood say?

Who is Stan Boskovich, and
why can’t C.A. find him? Will
Y.B. tell Abbo to go find himself
once more? What does Abbo do
on weekends?

Oh yes, you think you got it
bad. How do you think we like
rotting in Abbo’s office, huh?

Blow it out your shorts next

and maybe Chery] Teigs will
