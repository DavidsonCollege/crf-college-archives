HOROSCOPE.

Dorcas AND LITTLE DEBBIE

Consulting Astrologists

Aries (March 21-April 20)— Q*bert comes to you in a vision after a

games. Don’t get *& @! Get even. Lucky tool: Joystick.

Taurus (April 21-May 20)— Shun the trendy foods of yuppiedom.
Sun-dried tomatoes, portobella mushrooms, sushi, any food with
baby in front of it and all nouvelle cuisine are all OUT. Lucky
repast: beans’n’rice.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)— Revive the little known cousin of the
spaghetti western. The orzo western© has more appeal, in a little
but well rounded way. Thus spake Dorcas. Lucky Person: Chef
Boyardee.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)— This week, like so many others, is
stunning in its pure, lyrical beauty. Don’t worry about your life,
your future, graduate school. All will be well because you are
ecstasy.

Leo (July 23-August 22)— Take advantage of the springtime to learn
about the birds and the bees. It takes a lot to get ‘em right, but if
you work real hard at it, you certainly can. Lucky name: Mrs. G.

hensible. Mantra: “RAN is only a movie.’

Libra (September 23-October 22)— Water your lawn at night and be
sod ghoul.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)— Find the hidden quarry on
Davidson campus. This involves a lot of digging. Get your

and stop spreading rumours about your mates or mum™, Lucky
place: Stonehenge or the Royal Albert Hall. eect

sessed by the devil, then do this: take a hedgehog and rub it on
your face. The devil will come out.

Aquarius (January 20-February 18)— Cast off the fetters of the non-
age. In other words, think for yourself. You might be suprised,
but this doesn’t happen very often here at Davidson. Try this: “I
think...”

East River. You really did a job on those take home testes. Lucky

Part of a rhythmic nation

By S. ALLEN
Guest Writer

If a boost of energy is what you
needed to begin the weekend, the
BSC was the place to be Friday
night. Chris Thompson and the
Cultural Ensemble visited Davidson
College to educate and entertain
with their African-styled drumming,
singing, and dancing as a part of the
campus Umoja celebration.

If the occasion had to be
summed up in one word, ‘ener-
getic’ would most accurately fit the
description.

The fast-paced drum rhythms
and quick, flighty dancers were a
perfect match. The two supported
each other so well that it was hard to
distinguish which was uplifting the
other: was the music for the danc-
ers or the dancers for the music?
Just as every beat of the drum was
powerful, so was every movement
of the dancers. They were not
merely going through their choreo-
graphed movements, but passion-
ately communicating through mu-
sic and dance.

A member es the Cultural Ensemble takes flight.

The program consisted of four

main components. To introduce
the show, a traditional Tam Tams
(drum call) was performed. In Af-
rican cultures the calling of the
drums is a major form of communi-
cation to alert the village of impor-
tant news. Once the performers had
the attention of the audience, they
proceeded with the Song of Bless-
ings. These enchanting lyrics, al-
though foreign to the American ear,
put the audience ina swaying trance.

After the beautiful singing, the
Water Dance followed. Every mo-
tion of the dancers begged the heav-
ens for rain and a good harvest.

Amazingly, they didnot spend more -

than a second on either foot.

Toclose the event the audience
partook in a Bontaba, where every-
one danced together to the beat of
the drums. Chris Thompson con-
cluded the evening by asking the
audience take a pledge to never
look down on anyone unless for the
purpose of reaching down to lift
them up. Awed by the dancing and
inspired by the message, audience
members were certainly infused
with the energy to face the rigors of
Davidson life.

All performers should be com-

mended for a great evening of mu-
sic. At the conclusion of the perfor-

mance, Duncan personally recog-
nized and thanked Mrs. Lawing for
her dedication. Lawing sacrificed
preparing her own recital to learn
and rehearse all the accompaniments
of the Sonatas. Appreciation for
her time, patience and virtuoso tal-
ent is well-deserved.

good buzz, I skipped to the cashier
for two tens and a fiver.

The entire escapade took three
hours, with only 45 minutes hooked
up to the machine. The rest of the
time was spent waiting and answer-

ing medical questions. The next
visits (and there will be more) should
only take an hour. I can go twice a
week with an average pay-off of
$20 a visit. I highly recommend
this avenue of income, and although
there isn’t much room for advance-
ment, the people are great and $20
an hour isn’t bad. Pretty soon I'll
probably even have enough money
to buy food, and my friends won’t
have to “borrow” rolls from the
Commons anymore.
