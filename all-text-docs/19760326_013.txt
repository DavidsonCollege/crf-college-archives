Wildcat trackmen

The Wildcat track team now
holds a 2-1 record after
defeating Lynchburg College
here Saturday and splitting a
dual meet with Wake Forest
and High Point College at
Wake Forest Tuesday.

Saturday’s meet was
expected to be close, but
fourteen first places and
several surprising second and
third place finishes helped the
Cats to a decisive 98-65
victory.

Three school records were
set in the meet.

In the hammer throw,
Davidson took all three places,
with Jarry Taylor’s 134’6”’
first place throw, the first new
record of the day.

In other field events,
Davidson had first place
performances by Ray Berber-
ick in the javelin with 41’%”’,
Allen Schaberg with 130’2” in
the discus, and John Stanfield
in the high jump with a leap of
6’6’’, another school record.

In other events, Doug Horn
set the third school record of
the day in the steeplechase
with a time of 9:44, thereby

breaking Bob Lautensack’s
old record. Horn also took the
880 yard run with a time of
1:59.4.

Another double victor, Carl
McPhail, won the 120 yard
high hurdles in 15.5 and the
440 yard intermediate hurdles
in 57.0, just three tenths of a
second off the school mark.

Fred Borch, the third
Wildcat trackman with two
firsts in the meet, won the mile
in 4:25.5 and the three mile
run in 14:59.6. Steve Justus
took the 440 dash in 52.3, and
David Swaim gave the Cats a
sprint victory by winning the
100 yard dash in 10.1.

Although the meet was
decided earlier, the final event
of the day, the mile relay, was
one of the most hotly contest-
ed of the races.

The Davidson team, after
being behind for two laps,
caught up when Jim Douglas
closed the gap in the third lap
and won the event when
anchor man Mark Postove
overtook the Lynchburg
runner and held the lead until
the finish. The other members
of the relay team were Steve
Justus and Bruce Corser.

The Cats did not fare quite
as well Tuesday, when they
beat High Point 60-45 but
were beaten 84-60 by Wake
Forest in a tri-meet in

Winston’ Salem.

Davidson only posted three
first places in the meet: John

John Lewis in the pole vault,

Davidson’s baseball team
went two for three against
Fairfield and Appalachian this
week upping their record to
4-11 and 2-1 in conference
play.

The team split a double-
header at East Carolina last
Saturday, losing the first
game 3-0, and with strong
pitching from Tim Barr, won
the second game 3-2.

Monday and Tuesday saw
the Wildcats on the field
against the Stags of Fairfield
College’ The Cats won on
Monday by a score of 9-6, but
poor pitching and batting led
them to an 11-1 loss on
Tuesday.

On Wednesday, everything
that went wrong on Tuesday
went right, and Davidson won
against Appalachian State
University by the score of 9-6.
On the mound, Mike Hall
worked his way out of a few
major offensive threats by the
Mountaineers to go all the way
for the Wildcats. His excellent
pitching, coupled with some
long awaited batting prowress
by Jim Nichols, Stan Brown,
Ed Willingham, and others in
the line-up proved too much
for the Apps.

‘Hitting has been our prob-
lem all along,’’ said Coach
Palmer Muench. ‘‘When |we

hit, we win; when we don’t, we .

don’t.”

_ Pitching hasn’t been much
of a problem for the team, but
the players have lacked confi-
dence at the plate. Perhaps the
flurry of hits in Wednesday's
game will turn things around
for the Cats.

Besides past weak hitting, a
new problem has arisen for

Davidson’s highly touted
pitching staff. Tim Barr,
formerly number two in the
pitching line-up, re-injured his
right knee Monday night in
IMAC volleyball competition.
His absence throughout ‘the
rest of the season, could be a
factor in the Wildcat’s bid for
the Southern Conference
crown.

With a winning conference
record at the moment, Mike
Hall suggested that perhaps
the team “‘gets up’’ more for
Conference games than the
others.

He reiterated what Coach

Muench said about hitting
being the key to winning, and
added that when Willingham
or centerfielder Mitch Stone
having a good day at the
plate, the others, particularly
freshmensT'im McDowell, Tim
Goodell, and Rick Blinkhorn,
seem to follow suit.

Blinkhorn was also singled
out by Coach Muench for his
improvement, both offensively
and defensively.

Coach Muench _ wisely
avoided making any predic-
tions he might have for later
games, and simply said,
“We'll play ’em one at a time.

If we can keep our confidence

be alright.’’

The doubleheader against
V.M.I. here on Saturday, will
provide a good opportunity for
the Wildcats to entrench
themselves high in the con-
ference standing, and allow
Davidson baseball fans an
exciting afternoon out-of-
doors.

Not counting the relay
team, four Wildcats placed in
more than one event, being
McPhail, Borch, Taylor, and
Milt McCurdy, with 4th, 2nd,
2nd, and 2nd places respec-
tively. Borch’s performance in
the three mile run, although
second in the race, was
nevertheless a new Davidson
record at 14:44.

will be Tuesday, March 30
when they face Washington
