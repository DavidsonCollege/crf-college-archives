So I “got down” at the Rusk

formal Saturday night.
And amidst my dancin’ and singin’
and movin’ to the groovin’, I noticed
a six-foot-eight Rusk invitee who
definitely had a little extra jiggle to
his wiggle and was definitely movin’
and groovin’. A dashing Stephen
Marshall swung his. date around to
the music as Fred Astaire only wished
he could and shimmied his shimmy in
ways that would bring the King of
Pop to envy. Marshall was the man
on the dance floor. I believe I even
witnessed several students approach
him in inquiry of dance lessons.

He said hi to me because we're
cool like that.

Seeing the starting forward from
the men’s basketball team at the for-
mal got me thinking.. Two hours
earlier, I had eaten dinner with my
date and made extended trips to the
bathroom to snag peeks at the UNC-
UConn game as I passed the-bar. I
wondered how many times Antawn
Jamison gets tuxed up to goto school
formals. I wondered how it felt to
cheer for a basketball player who I
didn’t even know went to my school
until I saw him on national television
with a tank top and Nikes.

I was honestly curious to find
the answer. I didn’t have any friends
at UNC to call. However, I did have
ahigh school buddy named Jake who
attends Michigan, a similarly presti-
gious athletic institute.

So when I returned from Rusk, I
called Jake in Ann Arbor, Mich. and
asked him if he had ever bumped into
the Tractor Traylor at any parties, and

Davidson Basketball is just the way we like it.

if he did, could he break it down like
Stephen Marshall.

After several moments of strange,
awkward silence on Jake’s part, he re-
plied that no, he in fact has never seen
Tractor in person but thought that his
300-pound frame wouldn’t allow him

. too much flexibility on the dance floor.

Jake hung up, thinking I was a tad
bit weird, and my floating thoughts
traveled to two weeks ago in Atlanta,
where I and several hundred other Wild-
cat fans witnessed Marshall trade el-
bows with the six-eight, wide-bodied
Tractor Traylor of Michigan. It slowly
became apparent, as Michigan’s lead
grew exponentially, that I would not
have the opportunity that evening to
storm the Georgia Dome hardcourt. I
would not get the opportunity to taunt
each diehard Wolverine fan in the build-
ing. For one brief second, I wished that
our Davidson Wildcats could have been
in such a fortunate position as our Wol-
verine adversaries. For that one sec-
ond, I wished that Tractor Traylor might
have chosen Davidson as his construc-
tion site, and that this year’s number
one high school recruit might consider
Davidson over Duke as a place to con-
tinue his basketball career.

When I saw Marshall shimmy on

the dance floor, I recognized that the .

Michigan Basketball team, in contrast
to Davidson’s, is not quite a part of the
school nor a reflection of it.

Twelve young men, more natu-
rally gifted as athletes than many of us
could ever imagine, simply happened
to coalesce at the same school. They do
not partake in the activities most stu-
dents do, the studies or the social life.
They exist independently from the
school.

What would happen if head coach
Bob McKillop suddenly found ways to

attract the top echelons of each re-
cruiting class? While the student
body ignored the small additions that
the new team members accumulated,
such as spanking new cars and gold
jewelry, the Davidson world as we
know it would be turned upside down.

Think about it. Play song with
me, here.

Four years from now, after one
rebuilding season and three heroic
runs to the Final Four, a Dukesque
basketball program would revitalize
Davidson College. Along with the
athletic success of the basketball team,
the football program would be forced
to drop its Division I-AA non-schol-
arship status, answering the rapidly
growing community’s demand for
another fan sport.

The two sports combined would
bring an unknown popularity to the
quaint town we know as Davidson.
Raefford’s Barber shop would be hap-
pily forced to evolve into a national
franchise, rivaling the likes of the
Hair Cuttery for customers.

Oh, and by the way, transfer
enrollment would set records, as the
“New Davidson” would inherit all of
the Dukies who went to Durham just
for basketball.

So I left Rusk with a puzzled
look on my face, trying to imagine
Tractor Traylor ina tux at a Davidson
formal, a sight that Michigan stu-
dents never see because in many
senses, they are not students. I tried to
see him boogying his boogie and
shimmying his shimmy as I had seen
Marshall do with so much success.

I couldn’t imagine it. Davidson
basketball shouldn’t change. We like
it the Way it is. Our players are
students and our friends. That is how
it should be.

Individualefforts highlightday

A trip to the Wake Forest Invita-
tional would mean stiff competition,
right? Try two ACC teams- Duke and
the host Demon Deacons- and three
ConferenceUSA teams- Cincinatti, Lou-
isville, and UNC-Charlotte. Davidson’s
absence from the lists of finishers in the
events last Saturday may seem disheart-
ening, but it is completely: overshad-
owed by the Wildcats’ personal perfor-
mances. In fields crowded with athletes
from bigger scholarship schools, the
Davidson athletes ran hard and piled up
one season-best time after another.

The highlight of the day was the
performance of rookie Smyth Bitter,
who set a new school record in the 800
with a time of 2:18.79. She finished
sixth overall in the event before going
on to take seventh in the 1500 with a
season best time. of 4:48.34.

This was one of a number of sea-
son best performances for the women.
Jamilah Sawyer had a season best
1:10.36 in the 400 hurdles. Kate
Feldmeier also had a season best time in
800 and 1500, and finished in the top 20
in the 1500. Junior Beth Brewster ran a
season best in the 5000 meter run as
well.

The only thing more impressive
than the list of season best times was the
list of personal best times. Rookie

Clare Frey and Jill Neumayer were
among those who recorded personal
bests. Frey had the best two races of her
track career in the 800 and 1500.
Neumayer ran a personal best in the
1500 and placed in the top 25. In the
3000 meter run, Allie Curran recorded
an outdoor best time and Catherine
Walsh had a personal best.

Assistant Coach Thoman Cason
was thrilled with the team’s perfor-
mance. He stated, “The effort was
there, and great performances followed.
This meet helped us prepare for our
team mission, the Southern Conference
Championships on April 17-18. We all
came away from this meet confident
and ready to work even harder.”

For the men, Brent Ferrell was the
standout for the Wildcats, finishing elev-
enth in the 3000 and eighth in the 5000
meter run with times ‘of 8:52.16 and
15:23.47, respectively. Ferrell was the
only runner to place this high for the
men.

Steve Hsieh was the top finisher
for Davidson in the 100 with a time of
11.48. Adam Marcotte was best for the
’Cats in the 200, as was Mike Albert in
the 400.

In the 4x100 relay, Stan Baker
teamed up with Hsieh, Marcotte, and
Albert finished with a time of 45.66.
Marcotte, Albert, and Baker also ran in
the 4x400 with Keith Chapman and
recorded a 3:33:31 time.

Women’s tennis team rebounds from tough losses to beat App. State

By ALIson KALETT
Staff Writer

Last Saturday, the Davidson
women’s tennis team successfully re-

- bounded

\Wildcats _ 8} from
App. State q|] two
; con-

secutive losses by beating Appalachian
State University. App State never
proved a serious threat as Davidson
won eight of the nine overall matches,
including all of the doubles matches.
Number one seed, junior Dana
Casner and number two, freshman
Kristen Koenig, easily won their singles
matches with respective 6-2, 6-4 and 6-

2, 6-1 scores.

At number three singles, Claire
Cheatwood triumphed in a very close
contest, with the final score being 7-5,
1-6,6-4. Number four Clara Marks also
had a close three-set match but came up
short, losing the final two sets 6-2,6-0
after winning the first 6-0. Number five
singles player Lynne Shone and Num-

ber six Brenda Tindall each enjoyed
easy singles victories. Tindall tri-
umphed without dropping a single game.
Up by an overall 5-1 score heading
into the doubles matches, Davidson was
assured of the win. However, guaran-
teed victory did not lead to compla-
cency, as all of the Davidson doubles
teams enjoyed convincing victories.

At number one doubles, Casner
and Koenig had a convincing 8-1 win,
while the number two team of Shone
and Marks and the number three team
of Tindall and Cheatwood both gar-
nered 8-2 wins.

The Lady Wildcats’. record now
stands at 5-7. Davidson’s next match
was against UNC Greensboro today.
