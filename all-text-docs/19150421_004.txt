First Carolina Game.

On April 15, after having a weary
journey down ta Columbia from Clin-
ton, the Red and Black nine met defeat
at the hands of South Carolina.

It looked at the start as if the Pres-
byterians would get the better of the
Game Cocks. In the third inning the
Davidson batters pounced updn Babe
Adams’ delivery and coupled with errors
they managed to score four runs. Three
errors, two stolen bases and — Austin’s
home run were responsible for the quar-
tet of tallies.

Beginning with the next inning Caro
lina settled down for the remaindeér of
the game and plaved air tight ball. ‘Phen
Davidson went to pieces and for three
innings. the fourth, fifth and. sixth, the
Game Cocks scored twelve runs.

Babe Adams worked nicely for the
University. only three hits were gotten
off him, one.of which was a scratch. He
did not give a base on balls. his anly
wildness being when he poked Groome
in the ribs in the sixth inning.

Hendegeveld, who had pitched the
day before, worked hard and steady, and
had the team played as usual the outcome
_would have been very different, for he
kept his hits well scattered and had good
control.

Second Carolina’ Game.

Davidson reversed its form and com-
ing back strong the next afternoon de-
feated the University of $C. 10 to 4.

Errors by the Carolina ‘players plus
timely hits tell the tale. Christenbury,
the first man up for Davidson, got to
first on Horton's error. A moment later
he was caught between first and second
and oa a bad throw was safe at the key-
stone station. Somerville sacrificed and
a passed ball counted the runner,

In the second inning singles by
Stough, Lawson, Alford and Austin, a
sacrifice hit, four errors and a wild pitch,
netted the Red and Black six runs.

Lawson, the first batter in the fourth
inning. opened the round with a single
his second hit of the day. Christenbury’s
sacrifice and Austin’s single scored him.

Davidson made two more runs in the
fifth inning, With one out Walker
walked. On Black's single he ‘went to
third and when Christenbury doubled
hoth runners counted.

Carolina's rally in the ninth brought
in four runs. Smith, the first hitter, was
pasted in the ribs, Barxtelle’s roller was
booted by Somerville and when Clark
singled the bases were full. Horton's
triple cleared the sacks and left him on
third. He counted a moment later on
Kerr’s single to right. Groome was then
sent in to replace Lawson, and retired
the side, ending the game.

Lawson pitched splendid ball — for
Davidson until the ninth, when Caro-

man. Box score:

Charlotte Game.

On Saturday afternoon, April 17,
Davidson met the Hornets on Wearn
field in Charlotte and were defeated by
Manager Emery’s aggregation by the
score of 4 to 1.

‘The team seemed a little tired, this
being natural ‘since they arose at 4:30 to
leave, Columbia. Nevertheless they
fought hard throughout the entire game.

Groom started the game for the Red
and Black and pitched good ball for five
innings. During that time he allowed
the Hornets but three hits, but due to
the fact that the wind was high and
against his curves he gave four free trips
to the initial sack.

In the fifth Charlotte scored two runs
on an error, a base on balls, a sacrifice
hit and a single.

Lawson replaced Groome in the sixth
and allowed the Hornets but four hits
during the four innings that he pitched.
He also had one bad inning, this being
the seventh, when the locals’ scored two
more runs, these being due to a double,
a single. a base on balls and a. sacrifice
fly.

Davidson’s only run came in the
eighth, when Lawson singled and scored
later on an error.

GYM TEAM MAKES TRIP.

‘Tuesday the gym team made the first
trip of the year when it left for Lenoir,
N.C. An exhibition was given there
last night under the auspices of the
Lyceum. The men composing the team
are: Winn, Thacker, Porter, Jones,
Young. McKeithan, Hawkins, Harper,
Childs, and D. P. Smith. Three of the
old men were unable to take the trip.

The mats and springboards of the
Davidson gymnasium have been made
over and are practically as good as new.

Immediately after the return Wednes-
day morning the team will begin practice
for the exhibition at Commencement.
and there is every reason to believe that
it will be one of the best ever given here.
