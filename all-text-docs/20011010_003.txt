Series of car break-ins
puts campus on alert

Davidson’s campus hardly seems like the
ideal place for acrime wave. Due in large part
to the Honor Code, many students feel little
need to carefully guard their personal posses-
sions. A recent
series of car
break-ins, how-

vided a rude

Almost all of the looted cars broken were

. parked in satellite, the northmost end of the

parking lots behind West Hall. According to

Officer Tricia Warren, the windows in most

of the cars were broken before the thieves

entered, save for one case in which the car’s
doors had been left unlocked.

safety for

“I know this could have happened any-
where, but it was still.a shock to find my car
broken into at Davidson. It’s something that
normally doesn’t even cross anyone’s mind
around here,” said Lee Bruner ’04, whose car
fell victim to the thieves.

“T found my. car on Tuesday afternoon. It
was parked right under the light in the middle
of satellite. The passenger side window was

shattered, and the CD ripped out of the con-—

sole.”

Nick Brandham ’04 and Rob Neuman ’04
were also among last week’s victims; all had
Alpine AM/FM CD players installed in their
cars. ;

“Pissed? Oh, I’m pissed,” stated Neuman
when asked his reaction.

According to the Office of Public Safety, a
total of 14 cars have been hit. All of the stolen
stereo systems were AM/FM CD players,
and the thieves seem to be showing a prefer-
ence for Pioneer and Alpine systems. Addi-
tionally, the thieves have been making off
with CDs and money left in cars.

items can of-

tempting to would-be thieves than a stereo,
which has to be taken out of the car’s dash-
board.

Brunerexpressed concern over the college’s
response, saying, “the thing that bothers me is
that after my car was broken into earlier in the
week, the Campus Police apparently didn’t
take any serious preventative measures that
could have deterred the following break-ins.”

“Since students often have no other option
than to park in satellite, I hope campus secu-
rity patrols the lot more often each and every
night,” Brandham added.

The Office of Public Safety is “not saying
exactly what we’re doing” to address the
problem and prevent further thefts. How-
ever, Officer Warren did assure students that
police patrols in satellite have been increased.
“We’re doing all we can,” she said.

In an e-mail to the student body, Dean of
Students Tom Shandley announced that the
north gate to the parking lot will be closed and
locked indefinitely. These increased security
measures will be implemented “for as long as
necessary.”
