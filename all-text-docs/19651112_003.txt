Three Juniors To Study
In Washington Program

By BILL SEIGLER
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Three Davidson juniors will
spend the spring semester in
Washington. D. C., at The Amer-
ican University.

George Brown, Neville Patter-
son and Chuck Matthews, all
majors in political science here,
have been selected to represent
Davidson College this spring in
the Washington Semester pro-
gram.

The program is a cooperative
arrangement between The Amer-
ican University and certain ac-
credited colleges in the United
States, including Davidson. -Its
stated purpose is to provide a
realistic picture of the processes
of government in the political
center of the United States.

The three Davidson students
will study in the School of Gov-
ernment and Public Administra-

tion at The American University.
While in Washington they will
live on the university campus
and will be an integral part of
the student body for the semes-
ter. The students will carry an
academic load of 15 credit
to Davidson.

Besides their regular courses,
hours, which can be transfered
the students may take a special
three-hour seminar course in-
volving meetings with important
government. workers. They also
have the opportunity to under-
take individual research in some
predetermined field.

Davidson College, which part-
iclpates annually in the Washing-
ton Semester program, was re-
presented Jast year by Stephen
Graham and Decker Faw.

Graham, a political science
major from Florence, S. C.,
spoke very highly of the pro-

Graham concluded that the
semester had been a “very
worthwhile venture.”

The Davidson. representative
for the Washington Semester
program is Dr. W. P. Minter,
professor of political sciences.
Minter invites sophomores who
might be interested in partici-
pating in the program during
the 1966-67 spring semester of
their junior year to see him
(Chambers 330C).

Dr. Minter emphasized that the
selection of the three students
to represent Davidson was not
based on his particular major.

In Emory

The Davidson Debaters pull-
ed oné of the upsets of the sea-
son by fighting their way into
the quarter-finals of ,Emory’s
Peachtree Invitational Tourna-
ment last weekend.

The unheralded Davidson
team upset such traditional pow-
ers as Navy and Emory to
finish sixth out of sixty-one
teams. Greg Haynes and Tom
Rhodes beat a total of six
schools. including the powerful
University of Arizona team, to
attain the octo-finals.

Here Rhodes and Haynes
squeezed past Bradley Univer-
sity by a split decision, elevat-
ing them to the quarter-finals.
This match pitted Davidson
against top-ranked Dartmouth.
In an extremely close debate,
Davidson was edged out by a
two-to-one decision.

Rhodes was still stunned by
their showing, but remarked
Sunday evening, “We were de-
bating mostly against profession.
als—boys on debate scholar-
ships: I guess we were lucky
to beat so many of them.”

Contest

Mike Mooty and Tom Earn -
hardt -also raised a few eye-
brows among the powers, but
were hurt by a series of Jow-
scoring judges and poor. teams.
Most debaters agree that it is
harder to make a good showing
against a weak team because
of the triviality of the argu:
ment. Both Mooty and Earn-
hardt ranked high in delivery.

The freshmen also were out-
standing in the novice division.
The affirmative team, Shep
Johnston and Jim Cooley lost
only three: to the eventual
champion, second place winner,
and to the top-seeded Emory
‘team. Fletcher Hartsell and
Charley Eakes also made a
strong showing by winning four
ahd losing only two.

.Next month the Davidson De.
baters travel to the highly exclu.
sive Princeton tournament. Al-
though the scholarship barrier
will be even harder to crack,
Ray McMillan is pushing his
men to the limit. ‘“‘We've made
a good start,” he said this week.
“but we've only made a start.
I want to win."

Students Relate Stories
Of Brooklyn Summer

By ALLEN WEBB
Davidsonian Feature Writer

“We are not fighting for civil
rights or the liké, rather we
are trying to make the best of

' the situation as it presently ex-

ists."

Thus Arthur Ross, °'65, has
captured in a recent letter the
essence of what he and four
other Davidson students were
trying to accomplish in their
participation in the Summer
Program of the Lafayette Ave-
nue Presbyterian Church in
Brooklyn, N. Y.

For two months this summer

- these students taught in a Vaca-

tion Bible school, counseled in
a day camp, and supervised field
trips, recreation and handicraft

- activities in the midst of a

neighborhood notorious for its
high crime rate, prostitution,
illegitimacy and dope traffic.

Working with youngsters of
Korean, Puerto Rican, Negro,
white and mixed descent, they*
aimed, in Ross’ words, ‘‘to help
some of the kids amount to
more than they would have oth-
erwise.”’

Founded in 1857, Lafayette
Avenue Church once boasted a
membership of over 3,000, but

now its congregation numbers
only about 250, The two World
Wars, construction of the near-
by Brooklyn Navy Yard and in.
evitable sociological factors re-
sulted in the population shifts
that have radically affected the
life and the work of the church.

Yet this church did not flee
to the suburbs, resist its neigh-
borhood, nor lose all its original
members. Rather in 1960 the
congregation voted unanimously
to remain in its present location
and to minister fully to the im-
mediate multi-racial neighbor-
hood as well as to the larger
Brooklyn community.

Under the vigorous leadership
of the Rev. George L. Knight,
(who will preach in Vespers
Nov. 14), the church has been
a revolutionary force in the
neighborhood.

Rev. Knight's enthusiasm is
contagious; Jim Fuller caught
it as did Jon Miller and Dale
Joyner, all members of last
year’s class. So did junior Ken
Autrey and Sophomore Stan
Link.

Stirred in chapel last spring
by Fuller's talk on his associa-
tion with the church’s mission
and further motivated by Kays
Gary's column, these students

asked for and were given jobs in
Lafayette Avenue’s Summer
Program for the meager remu-
neration of room, board, Jaun-
dry and $10 a week.

Autrey, who taught primary
age children in the Bible school,
admits, “I feel it’s hard to say
I turned the world upside-down,”
but he did find the work ‘‘re-
warding." “I felt like I was

really doing something,” he
says,
Link, who worked in the

“Play Street’’ recreational pro-
gram for unchurched young-
sters, was struck by the par-
ents’ attitude of complete in-
difference. He cited one mother
who even refused to take her
children for free dental service.
She simply did not care to trou-
ble herself that much.

While realizing that he can-
not change the entire commu-
nity, the young Rev. Knight has
approached his problems with
an attitude of providing some
hope, leadership and guidance in
a community sadly lacking in
them.

He and his summer staff mem-
bers, many of them Southerners,
have undramatically and quiet-
ly carried to this complex and
troubled neighborhood an imag-
inative program that has helped
to fill this void.

honorable acts by the rest of the
college community.

Jim Stokes, who aided Burks
in the presentation of the pro-
posals to the council said, ‘‘It is
generally understood that ‘duty-
bound’ prescently means very
little to the average student.
The student body is only ‘duty
bound to report violations of the
Student Body Regulations, while
the Student Council and Honor
Court members are ‘honor
bound’.

‘Conduct isn’t part of an Hon-

or System. so why should a
small group of students be ‘hon-
or bound’ to report offenders of
this nature?” asked Stokes.

Burks added, ‘The whole
premise of my plan. is that. the
assumption of personal responsi-
bility. for the privilege of student
jurisdiction over the. regulations
is motive enough to cause a res-
urrection of the term ‘duty

bound” among the students.

“It is my feeling that the
average student would not inter-
pret this proposal as free i-
cense to do what he wishes in
the area of student conduct, but
would feel a genuine concern to-
ward maintaining a reasonable
situation in the dorms and fra-
ternity houses."’

Bill Council hailed Burks’ pro-
posal as the greatest advance
in student government at David-
son during his attendance here.
“The student body complains of
the paternalistic attitude of the
college, vet has done nothing to
get .rid of it. Most students are
content to let the administra-
tion and. a small group of. stu-
dents be responsible for the
maintenance of disciple accord-
ing to the present set of regu-
lations,"’ declared Council.

“This move would. give stu-
dents the chance to abolish the
idea of paternalism and assume
for themselves the responsibility
for student government.”

Dave Powell said he was very
enthusiastic over the proposition
made by Burks and Stokes. Said

“In ‘Honor Bound’ Clause

Powell, “Our objective now is
to familiarize ourselves with the
idea and its ramifications and
then initiate a campaign to
pass these proposais."’

Council then suggested that a
joint Student Council and Honor
Court committee be established,
with -four representatives from
each group and John Burks as
the chairman.

Those elected from the Stu-
dent Council were Randy Mc-
Knight. Dave Powell. Paul Mar-
ion and Bill Council. The com-
mittee will meet this week, dis+

Brooklyn Minister

The Reverend George L.

Brooklyn, N. Y., will speak at
Vespers this Sunday evening.

This church carries on a wel-

fare program in the surround-}

Rican and Negro children. In re-
cent years, several Davidson stu-
dents have spent
months helping Rev. Knight in

gates.

The Council approved Coving-
ton’s proposal but the final de-
cision will be left up to the
fraternities. Each representa-
tive will request that his fra-
ternity appropriate money to
defray transportation and lodg-
ing costs.

“We are planning a program
whereby a travéling workshop
would be formed,” Covington
said. /‘This would begin by send-

added.

Several goals which Coving-
ton set forth were “‘to seek to

trends in. the fraternity world”
and ‘to research areas and_pro-

Nov. 22, redate cards will be
given out to the freshmen. They
will confirm the redates by re-
turning the cards on Nov. 23.

Bids from fraternities will be
turned in to the IFC by 12 mid-
night, Dec. 15. The bids will be
mailed to the freshmen on Dec.
18. Final action was not taken,
but it was suggested that the
rushee mail his acceptance of
the bid to the representative of
that fraternity.

In other action, a charge of
