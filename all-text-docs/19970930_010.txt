Everything to stop at Davidson

By WESLEY GOLDSBERRY

Every once in a while, students
here get an opportunity to see an up-
andcoming band before the world gets
its first glimpse. The Dave Matthews
Band concert three years ago undoubt-
edly pops into mind.

This Saturday, the musical group
Everything will perform at Sigma Phi
Epsilon on Patterson Court. The group
opened for the Who at a recent concert
at Nissan Pavilion outside Washington,
D.C., performing before a crowd of
nearly 25,000 — their biggest gig of
late.

Everything, who have been dubbed
“one of the best kept secrets in Ameri-
can music” by critic J.T. Griffith, is
fortunately not yet too “huge” to cease
their steady regimen of performing
nearly 200 club shows a year.

Their first major record is due out -

in January 1998 and will be distributed
to 52 countries around the world.

Everything is a 6-piece band from
northern Virginia, most of whose mem-
bers went to James Madison Univer-
sity. Having been together for eight
years, Everything has played at
Davidson a few times before. Accord-
ing to Craig Honeycutt, the band’s lead
vocalist and guitarist, the band always
encounters “nice people” here.

But don’t mosh when you’ re at his
shows.. ““Moshing’s over,” he said in a
recent telephone interview.

Their sound has been described as
an eclectic blend of rock, jazz, hip-hop,
and ska, creating a unique style that is
difficult to compare with those of other
musical groups — something that has
undoubtedly helped lead to their popu-
larity.

Their versatility in style has also
enabled them to play with a variety of
influential artists, including a stint with

Maceo Parker, former saxophonist for
James Brown.

Their songs are more inspired than
crafted. ““Artcomes from your personal
experience,” Honeycutt said. Although
he claims that the group has no few
special musical idols, Honeycutt said
he’s been listening to a lot of Los Lobos
recently.

Their new record is being produced
in the same studio where Nirvana re-
corded Nevermind, and should eventu-
ally receive significant radio airplay.

This Saturday night will be
everyone’s chance to preview a band
who could become as big as Hootie —
perhaps even bigger, for Everything
habitually uses more than three differ-
ent chords in éach of their songs.

As A.J. Hammer of VH-1 said of

Everything, “I think these guys are go-
ing to be huge.”

And if you can’t trust A.J. Ham-
mer, who can you trust?

Hodson audience

By WESLEY GOLDSBERRY

On Sunday, Sept. 21, alarge crowd
of community members, faculty, and
sudents gathered together for a musical
spectacle that probably even God never
intended.

But Milton Masciadri’s double bass
recital, the first of five concerts in this
year’s Davidson College Concert Se-
ries, was especially entertaining both
because of the quality of the perfor-
mance and the obscurity of the event.

Solo recitals are more typically
performed on instruments such as vio-
lin, piano, flute, cello, trumpet, or on a
cold day in Hell, viola. But the double
bass, in light of its extremely low range
of pitch and unruly size, is much more
strictly used as an ensemble instrument.

Those who deign perform solo lit-

erature upon it must often play entire
pieces on its highest string, hunched
over their instrument in a grueling
struggle to conquer pieces that could be
much more simply performed on one or
more instruments that are not quite so
“hippopotamic.”
It makes one ask the question, “Why?”
Because it’s all the more impressive if
you can pull it off, which Masciadri
could.

Accompanied by accomplished
pianist Edward Eikner, the South Ameri-
can native Masciadri performed seven
works ona 1690 Testore bass. The first
half consisted of Rachmaninoff’s fa-
miliar Vocalise and Schubert’s Sonata
in A Minor, D. 821 (Arpeggione).

Masciadri’s intonation was sus-
pect at points early in the performance,
but most of the audience paid little heed
to such details as they were transfixed,
in awe of his 300-year-old axe.

The pace quickened in the second
half with Gliere’s Intermezzo and Tar-

antella, Op. 9, in which Masciadri’s
fingers scrambled up and down the fin-
gerboard with impressive accuracy and
agility. He continued to outdo himself
throughout the remainder of the recital,
as the virtuosity of his repertoire never
waned.

The audience responded with en-
ergetic applause and a well-deserved
standing ovation following his encore.
Aside. from his musical prowess,
Masciadri proved a charming speaker
as ‘he addressed the audience several
times during the performance.

Masciadri is currently on faculty
at the University of Georgia and has
performed ‘as a soloist on three conti-
nents.

His performance last Sunday was
undoubtedly one of the more enthral-
ling recitals to grace Davidson’s cam-
pus in recent memory.

Creativity flows through the 900 Room

For those of you who missed
out on the “Art Night” debut, pic-
ture this: Free food, good music
(courtesy of Dustin Page, fellow
Davidson Student), Elmer’s glue,
beads, pipe cleaners, construction
paper, paints, colored pencils, magic
markers, popsicle sticks. . .

Need I say more?

A nice, relaxing atmosphere
and tons of materials to send us
back into our childhood where true
satisfaction came from simple cre-
ations with paint and glue.

The only difference is that now,
you can do all this and have a beer
at the same time — if you get one of
those green “over 21” hand stamps,
of course.

Danielle Mall, a senior atten-
dant of Art Night, was impressed

with the event. “This is so cool, my .

inner child needed this!” she ex-
claimed, holding a bottle of white
glue in one hand and colored Pipe
cleaners in another. ~ :

The event proved successful
and I hope that it will happen again
soon so that all you kids who missed
out will get a chance to play!

_ @ Art Night hits the 900 Room for the first time with a flurry of creativity.
