“Among the rate, e peeping John”

Bevan Takes Davidson by Storm

By JOHN FITE

Two years and five months ago
the trustees brought forth to this
campus a new professor, conceived
in Phi Beta Kappa and dedicated
to the proposition that all men
respond to both internal and ex-
ternal stimuli. Since that auspicious
occasion, Dr. John Morgan Bevan,
associate professor of psychology,
has secured the admiration and
respect of students from all fields
of endeavor, and his lectures are
an experience never to be forgot-
ten. Whether he happens to be dis-
cussing the concept-formation prin-
ciple of “dissociation by varying
concommitants” or the effects of
stress on the albino rat, Dr. Bevan
lends his whole inimitable person-
ality to his lecturing which indeed
gives psychology the status of on
experience rather than a subject.

His influence on the Davidson
campus, however, extends far he-
yond the classroom. The 3uccess-
ful religious emphasis week
which was concluded last week
was largely due to his

untiring efforts to bring to the

student body a program which was
both a “varied experience” as
well as a source of “greater in-
formation.” He stated recently
that the basic of the University
Christian Mission was one of “good
organization and an effective pro-
gram.” This desire for effective-
ness is indeed characteristic of
Dr. Bevan's total personality make-
up.

Dr. Bevan received his A.B. de-
gree from Franklin and Marshall
College and the B.D., M.A, and
Ph. D. degrees from Duke Univer-
sity. He was an instructor in the
psychology departments of both
Duke and Heidelberg College prior
to receiving an appointment at
Davidson in the fall of 1952. While
teaching in Ohio he held a Civil
Service appointment as Court
Psychologist in the Juvenile Di-
vision and served as an industrial
consultant with several outstand-
ing Ohio firms.

Dr. Bevan is a member of the
American Psychological Associa-
tion, Phi Beta Kappa, North Caro-

Med Admission Test
To Be Held May 7

The Educational Testing Service,
which prepares and administers
tests for the Association of Ameri-
ean Medical Colleges, has an-
nounced ‘that candidates for ad-
mission to medical school in the
fall of 1956 are advised to take
the Medical College Admission
Test in May. These tests, required
of applicants by almost every
medical college throughout the
country, will be ‘given twice dur-
ing the current ealendar year. Can-
didates taking the May test, how-
ever, will be able to furnish scores
to institutions in the early fall,
when many medical colleges begin
the selection of their next enter-
ing class.

Candidates may take the Admis-
sion Test on Saturday, May 7, 1955,
or on Monday, October 31, 1955, at
administrations to be held at more
than 300 local centers in all parts
of the country. The Association of
American Medical Colleges recom-
mends that candidates for admis-
sion to classes starting in the fall
of 1956 take the May test.

The Test consists of examina-
tions of general scholastic ability,
a test on understanding of mod-
ern society, and an achievement
test in science. According to the
Educational Testing Service, no
special preparation other than a
review of ‘science subjects is
necessary. All questions are of
the objective type.

In addition to the above list of
honors Dr. Bevan was recently
appointed to conduct a survey of
the status of psychology in Junior
and Senior colleges in North Caro-
lina.

In 1946 Dr. Bevan was married
to Miss Louise Dabbs of South Caro-
lina, who is also a graduate of
Duke University. The Bevans have
three children and make their
home on Concord Road.

Working with his colleague, Dr.
Workman, the psychology depart-
ment has made strides far greater
than even the wildest hopes of the
professional optimists. In less than
five years, the psychology depart.
ment has come to be recognized
as one of the leading undergrad.

the South and there is no end in
sight.

Sigma Pi Sigma
Holds Initiation

Alpha Chapter of Sigma Pi Sig-
ma, ‘national honorary physics
society, held an initiation cere-
mony Tuesday evening, February
15, at which six new members were
initiated.

For membership in the society
it is necessary to have completed
three semesters of physics and to
have shown a definite interest in
the study and advancement of
physics, the student must have
shown himself proficient in other
fields.

The six new members initiated
were Jack Curtis, senior; Sam In-
man, junior; Monty Littlejohn,
senior; ‘ Jerry Pietenpol, sopho-
more; Joe Billy Pharr, junior; and
Tommy Ratchford, sophomore.

carried out during the peried §
March-15 March, 1955, end no Hell-
week activities may be carried on
outside this period. 6. Bach fra-
ternity is strongly encouraged to
carry out a constructive project of
its own choosing es pert of its

Hell.week activity.

Other activities of Hell-week not
specified above will be interpreted
in the light of the resolution
adopted by the Interfraternity
Council.

The Interfraternity Council has
voted to empower itself to see that
this policy is carried out and any
offender may be tried by the LF.C.
The maximum penalty will be a
fine of not more than $50, and a
letter to the national headquarters
of the convicted fraternity.

This action by the LF.C. and
the committee represents an ef-
fort on the part of the fraternities
adequately to contro] the past ills
of Hell-week. The philosophy of
the groups working on the policy
has been that by self-control and
self-regulation, the fraternities
can retain the autonomy which is
necessary to the growth and preser-
vation of the fraternity system.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

Union Will Sponsor OF FEBRUARY 16 MEETING:

Trustees’ Report

__Dr._John R. Cunningham gave
his semi-annual report to the
Board of Trustees of the college
at the mid-winter meeting of that
governing body in session February
16 on the Davidson campus.

In the preface to his report, Dr.
Cunningham stated, “There are
two important considerations
which present themselves to the
colleges of our type which are
unprecedented in our day and
which call for action. The one is
a problem and the other is an en-
couraging challenge. The problem
is the clearly recognized rising
tide of college enrollment in the
years just ahead. The challenge is
the rising tide of philanthropy
throughout our country.

The rising tide of philanthropy
has been evidenced this past year
by an unprecedented interest on
the part of individuals, founda-
tions and corporations in private
colleges and in universities. Da-
vidson College is beginning to feel
the impact of corporation giving.

“This past year we received
gifts from such corporations as
DuPont, Danforth, Standard Oil,
Union Carbide, Ford, and Merrill.
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Beane
. .. It is highly important that
the college adjust itself for the
proper solicitation not only from
the nationally known foundations
and corporations but also from the
smaller ones closer home, as they
plan to enter the field of philan-
thropy more, largely than hereto-
fore... The sum of at least a
million and half dollars is needed
for endowment, dormitory con-
struction, and additions to the li-
brary.”

The president reported that dur-
ing the present year at Davidson
there are 63 teaching members of
the faculty who handle courses for
academic credit. Of the 58 faculty
members, not including ROTC or
physical education teachers, 20
hold Ph. D. degrees, an unusually
high percentage for a small lib-
eral arts college. Twenty-seven
are associate professors, and 15 as-
sistant professors.

The enrollment for the first
semester was 846 students; because
of withdrawals for various reasons,
the present number is 809.

Dr. Cunningham reviewed the
religious life on. the campus, re-
ferring to the chapel exercises,
the YMCA program, guest speak-
ers, Vesper services, and the re-
cent University Christian Mission
Week.

With reference to the financial
report given by the college
treasurer, D. Grier Martin, Dr.
Cunningham noted the gifts to
the Alumni Fund this past year
exceeded all former records by a
substantial amount, in the sum of
$81,739.77. A word of appreciation
was given to the Underwriters
Club, composed of 96 persons,
which gave $35,874 toward the
Alumni Fund.

Appreciation of the Administra-
tion was expressed for the effective
manner in which A. H. Whittle, as-
sistant director of Physical Educa-
tion and Athletics, and the staff
have handled the athletic program
since the departure of Paul Scott
as director. Dr. Cunningham
called attention to a satisfactory
year in athletics. In football, Da-
vidson won 6 games, lost 3; in
basketball, to date, 7 wins, 9 losses,
with the Conference record of 4
wins and 2 losses; and in swim-
ming, Davidson has won § meets
and lost none.

Announcement is made by action
of the Trustees, of the appoint-
ment of Tom Scott, formerly of the
University of North Carolina, as
the new director of athletics and
physical education. Now at Colum-
bia University completing work
for a Ph. D. degree he will receive
in June, Mr. Scott will begin his
duties at Davidson July 1.

The report of the librarian, Dr.
C. G. Davidson, to which Dr.
Cunningham referred at the con-
clusion of ‘his report, shows an ad-
dition of new stacks in the library
adding to the book capacity by
25,000 volumes. The total number
of books is now 62,736, or an in-
crease of 2,733 over last year. The
services of Mrs. P. A. Marrotte,
wife of a faculty’ member, have
been secured as A.B., and M.A.
reference librarian.

Announcement is also made of
the election of James W. Jackson,
Jr., of Colymbia, S.C., as associate
director of alumni and public rela-
tions. Mr. Jackson, now completing
work for an M.A. degree at the
University of South Carolina, is
a Davidson graduate with the
class of 1947.

After receiving the M.A. degree
this spring, he will come to Da-
vidson in June with his wife and
three children, to assume his
duties at the college.

The Trustees took action on the
recommendation of the Adminis-
tration for a slight increase in
salaries of all the academic staff
and, in a lesser amount, to all
non-academic employees of the
institution.

‘Bishop Misbehaves’ . . .
(Continued From Page One)
Frederick Jackson, is a farce, deal-
ing with the wiles of a bishop in
settling a swindling affair. Don
Meadows attempts to even the
score with Waller, who has
cheated Don's girl friend’s father
out of some money. The bishop
leaves his calling card in place of
some stolen jewels in a local pub,
and all parties gather at his home.
From there—but, then, you had
better see how “The Bishop Mis-

Behaves.”

Mr. Raymond W. Tyson is
equaling, if not even surpassing,
his previous directing exhibits on
this campus. Fred Summers, a fa-
miliar figure on the Davidson
stage, is turning in a job as the
bishop that is worthy of many pro-
fessionals. Martha Magill, as Hes-
ter, Anne Wilson, as the bishop’s
sister, and Betty Lamar as the
swindler’s wife, spice things up
a bit, to say the least. Harold Hall
(Don) and Tommy Mann (the
swindler) are more than com-
petent. Allie Cone plays Tim, Tom
Morgan is Collins, Warner Hall
(who will be remembered for his
witty performance in “Good
News") plays Frenchy, and Mac
Williamson is Brooke.

A very excellent set has been
designed and built by Jack Curtis
and Bob Rhodes. Incidentally,
Act I is set in a taproom...

Eye Witness...
(Continued From Page One)
one took this sort of talk serious-
ly. Just as the hero was about to
be executed we became aware of
flames just behind the screen.
Most of the theater-goers wanted
to see the outcome of the movie
and waited a few more minutes.
Then flames suddenly started
spouting into the auditorium above
the rear left exist. Immediately
the screen collapsed, and the
women and children began to

quietly file out.

Some people left by the side
exits, and leaving these doors wide
open, the flames were quickly
drawn up the side walls and ceil-
ing. From the safety of our seats
at the rear of the flick. Al Simp-
son made the profound comment,
“I was never in a burning build.
ing before.” This seemed to be
the attitude of several students
around us who stayed in their seats
until the lower section of the audi-
torium was enveloped in flames.
With the smoke becoming stifling
and the flames racing closer, we
decided not to wait to see which
wall would reach the rear exits
first. All of the remaining people
quietly walked out.

For a few moments we stood in
the lobby and offered to help re-
move the merchandise from the
candy counter, but the young lady,
not realizing the integrity of Da-
vidson men, locked it up to burn.
About this time, an event typical
of the general situation took place.
With half of the building an in-
ferno, some man, apparently con-
nected with the theatre, took a
fire extinguisher from the front

- wall and entered the auditorium.

At this point, it seemed to be best
to completely leave the building,
and the rest of the story was ob-
served by all.

The fire engines were slowly
gotten from their garage across
the street. The theater man
screamed at some little boys who
were taking the smoky pop corn
from the popper. Cop Linker
helped chop holes in the front of
the structure, and the flames
danced gaily against the night sky.

well go down in Davidson history
as the year of the fifth major re-
visions to the Student Government
Constitution.

The difference between victory
