tions, while the other 960 stu-
dents are only ‘duty bound,’ a
rather nebulous term.’’ Those

thirty people are the members
of the Student Council and Hon-
or Court.

‘I am a member of the Honor
Court, and it bothers me tre-
mendously that I would have to
enforce it when I think it is
anachronistic and should be re-
pealed.’’ Goodstein continued,
“It botbers me that we (on the
Honor Court) would have to kick
a student out of school for a
drinking violation — there is no
alternative."

The people who have signed
the petition, Goodstein reports,
are students from all classes,
Independents, fraternity men,
drinkers and non-drinkers. “I
don't believe they signed this
Simply because they want liquor

“By abolishing this provision
in our regulations, cheating,
‘stealing and lying — the real
honor violations — would |
ceive greater emphasis. and the
honor system will be strength- |
ened.

“We (there are others spon-
soring ‘this petition) feel that,

ing about issues. I believe we
can get a two-thirds. vote of |
the students which will com-|
pletely abolish this archaic rule !

Even if the drinking provision
of the student body regulations,
which Goodstein is fighting, is
aboLshed, the faculty regulation
against drinking will still be in
effect.

Scott notes that the organization

Scott Discusses Plans,
Appoints Union Board

in planning Union activities.

According to Scott exact plans
cannot be made as to the role
of the Union until definite plans
are announced concerning fra-
ternities. He does hope “‘to in-
crease the program for Fresh-
man™ and make the Union a
campus wide organization.
The committees and their
chairman are as follows: Pub-

licity, Joe Jelks; Publications,
Bill McGuire: Social. Neil Mc-
Bryde and David Powell; Stu-
dent Forum, Pat Hubbard and
David Meschan: Hospitality,
Cal Calhoun and Dan Campbell;
Games, John Fagg: Movies,
Gordon Ball: Open End, Paul
Simpson: House, Zack - Long;
Fines Arts. Lou Hill; Music,
Mark Brown and Chuck Mat-
thews: and Display, B. A. Aiken.

When questioned about the un-

usually heavy concentration of
fraternity men heading the com-
mittees Scott said. ‘“‘There are
{more fraternity men. but not
, just because they belong to fra-
ternities. We want the very best
men for the jobs and feel that
we have them.”

Regarding Long's ‘return for
another semester Scott said,
“He's an outstanding man and
has done a fine job. Of course
we will be glad to have him
again next year.”

Each committee is planning
full scale , activities for next
year. Scott seemed especially
interested in the Fine Arts Com-

did while they were there.

Also, there will be a small
amount of money left over to
sustain the program here and
in Ecuador as PRAM will just
be getting started in Ecuador
next year.

Hopes are that the project will
receive $2,400 from the YMCA
Easter Gift Fund. $2,000 has
been pledged by the Jim J.
Cannon Foundation, and the
Richardson Foundation has al-
50 pledged S2.C00. ‘The ten stu-
dents will supply an. additional
