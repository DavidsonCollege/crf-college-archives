Truth Prevails as Error Corrected

BUCKY ‘
With B.B. and M,T;

All right, Richardson Ill, ~
cool your jets. So we misrepor-
ted the score of your game
against the SPE’s.

Just because you guys.
‘really won by a conversion, 7-
6, instead of losing to the Eps
doesn’t mean you have to
behave like a group of juvenile
simians. It wasn’t our fault
anyhow because somehow the
scorecard we read had the
wrong information.

By using the logic we lear-
ned on the law boards, (if not
A, then why not B?), and our
own Sherlock Holmes-like
deductive powers, we have
come to three possibilities.

1.) The Spe’s did it to fool
C.A. and Y.B,

2.) The doughhead ref. filled
out the card incorrectly.

3.) Some KA did it to make
the SPE’s look like assholes.

You know as-much as ‘we —

do. Anyone; who knows the

correct answer ought to call

892-8021 and ask for Sam.
Before we get to the flicker-

~ ball score, we'd like to report

some scores in the minor fall
IMAC sports, horseshoes and
golf.

In horseshoes, the SAE
team of. Dulin ard McLean
defeated Willingsham and
Baine of KA, 23-20 in the
championship match.

In golf, the Phi Delt team of
Bobby Clayton and Dan Hen-
derson took the best ball event
witha score of 72.

For Season Glory —

Seasoned veterans. and
a new head coach have raised
hopes that the Davidson
College swimming team can
improve last year’s cellar per-
formance. With the first meet
less than a month away, both
coach Pat Drake and assistant
coach Tom Miller expressed
confidence in their chances.

“Tam realty impressed with
the potential some of. the
members of the team have
demonstrated. We are spen-
ding this month in rigorous
pre-season conditioning, and
everyone is getting in good
shape,’’ Miller said.

He explained that practice
sessions are held two times a
day, at 6 a.m. and 2:30 p.m.
‘Attendance is required at
one practice per day. Because
many have labs in the af-
teynoons, we decided that a
morning practice would be of-
fered,”’ Miller continued.

The swimmers are doing up
to 6000 yards each per week
with occasional timed laps.
for conditioning purposes,
November will be spent in
timed sprints in preparation
for the season opener in the
Fast Carolina relays on Nov

16, Miller concluded.

Drake stated that the swim-
ming program is in the
process of being upgraded

' generally. ‘“‘We want to make

th: swimming program at
LCavidson more seriously com-
petitive. So we have improved
the schedule, obtained better

equipment, and intensified the
workouts.

“T realize that, harder
workouts will drive some

people away, but we want to
provide an atmosphere that
encourages dedicated work.
The people on the team know
what is expected of them, and
that makes, for a_ healthy
program. A foundation like
this is necessary to get any
sport established at a school,”
Drake explained.

Much ofthe optimism for
this season is based ‘on the
solid strength of returnees,
who performed well in last
year’s. Southern Conference
tournament. These include
Jack Doscher, John Scholer,
Susan ‘Reid, John McArthur,
and Rob Mitchell, Drake listed
