Instant Coeducation Plan

o

SGA Committee Proposes

y

By TOM AINSWORTH
Staff Writer

The SGA’s Committee on Co.
education, headed by Reggie
Kennedy. recently distributed
a number of letters to members
of the faculty and administra-
tion in which they proposed a
plan for immediate implemen-
tation of coeducation, without
adding unnecessary
tures.

Their suggestions include
transforming Duke Dormitory
into a women’s residence, and
transferring the displaced sen-
iors and juniors into off-campus
housing.

The latter situation would be
eased by a lessening of off-cam-
pus housing restrictions by the
college and an increased em-

will have the opportunity to
sample the works of Bartolt

Brecht. a twentieth century
German playwright. He wrote
“Mother Courage.’ “‘The Cau-

casian,’ ‘‘Chalk Circle.’’ and

several other plays.

In delivering “Brecht 9 on
Brecht.” the N. C. Schoot of
tne Arts will attempt to effec-
tively present Brecht’s unique
style of loosely connected
scenes and songs that intention-
ally avoid a literal representa-
tion of reality.

This presentation of his works.
with a cast of four women and
four men, was written by
George ‘Taborj and was °lirst
produced in New York in 1962.

Javier Calderon. a classical
guitarist, will Share iis talents
with Davidson’ students = on
January 7 in the second of four
programs given by the N. C.
School of she Arts. Calderon has
had meteoric success as a
guitarist since he began play-
ing the instrument ut the age
of nine.

Calderon made his

(Continued from Page 1)
will be hurt by this bill if it
does not make a decision soon,”
Clodfelter said. ‘‘Recent actions
by the trustees allowing women
to receive degrees and approv-
ing of coeducation in principle
already commit Davidson Col-
lege to coeducation, according
to Fuller.”

The cutting off of federal
funds would hurt the college in
the work/study program as
well as possible federal funds
for the new library.

Throughout the coeducation
battle, College President Samuel
R. Spencer Jr. has remained
up on the hill and out of the
fray.

Convalescing from the scars
gained in last year's uctivism,
Spencer says he is generally in
favor of coeducation but refuses
to comment on individual plans
for fear of pre-judging the fac-
ulty committees.

it may just be possible that
the decision and the plan for
coeducation has already been

decided between
trustee leaders.

The president may just be
allowing the students, faculty
and other administrators to en-
gage in battle to keep their
minds off other things, or to
allow them to vent their per.
sonal opinions.

Spencer may know just exact-
ly how coeducation will be im-
plemented. If this is so, how-
ever, the president is probably
thinking of coeducation four or
five years from now at least
until after the library is com.
pleted.

1966 and won acclaim from such

artists as Pablo Casals and
Andres Segovia. Calderon is
now an assistant to the art

guitar instructor at the School
of the Arts.

On February 11. a classical
ballet (to be announced) will
be presented by the school’s
new dance company, Tne com-
pany. known as the North Car.

olina Dance Theaire, was es.
tablished through a  $250.000
grant from the Rockefeller

Foundation.

Directed bs Robert Lindgren.
former featured artist with the
Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo.
the Dance Theatre should in-
deed provide the Davidson stu-
dent with a rare experience in
outstanding ballet.

Music will be the theme of
the last program in the Artist
Series when the Piedmont
Chamber Orchestra comes to
Davidson. Formed in 1968
through an earlier Rockefeller
Foundation grant. the ensemble
is composed of hand-picked pro
fessionals including the Clare.
mont String Quartet and Clarion
Wind Quintet.

Its well-known director. Nich-
olas Harsanyi, was formerly
founder and conductor of the
celebrated Princeton Chamber
Orchestra and recently served
as music director of the Inter.
lochen Arts Academy Orchestra.

In order to take advantage
of these fine programs provid
ed by the N. C. School of Arts,
students must pick up their
free tickets at the Union Desk.
Date tickets will be $1.00. David-
son faculty and staff can pick
up their complimentary tickets
at the College Music Depart-
ment.

phasis on the Junior Year
Abroad program.

To accommodate the number
of incoming coeds, the number
of -men in the freshman class
would be cut by 30 to 40.

This whole proposal would be
put into effect, moreover, with-
out the college having to build
any new dorms, hire new fa-
culty. or increase tuition or en-
dowment.

When asked how such a plan
could be brought about when
the college has continually sta-
ted its position on the subject
as depending on a shaky finan-
cial status, Kennedy replied
that there were conflicting re-
ports on this point, some ad-
ministrative officials feeling
that the college is not that bad
off. -

Continuing, Kennedy stated
that one of the committee's
more hopeful goals is to have
the college “make a commit-
ment” on coeducation.

**Personally,” Kennedy said,
“I would certainly like to see
Davidson go coed, but on the
other hand I wouldn't like to
see the college hang itself.

“It's a lot healthier for a col-
lege to go coed because it wants
to, not because it’s being for-
ced,” he concluded.

David Smith, the committee's
publicity manager, commented
on some of the proposal's key
points, First, he feels that there
is sufficient off-campus housing
10 accommodate the number of
seniors displaced and that the
whole matter shouldn’t place a
very great financial burden on
the college.

In relation to this committee
proposal, Donald L. Winston,
cirector of development. said
that the cost of cuttinb num-
ber of male students in favor of
women wouldn't be any great-

er. But is that what we want to

do?” he said.

“This is one question that the
Students must ask themselves.
I'd like to see a survey taken

41270 N. Main

among the students, seeing if
they want to decrease the num-
ber of qualified male appli-
cants, knowing that they them-
selves might not have gotten
in here (if such a program were
in effect).”

Commenting on the Duke
Dorm proposal, Winston said he
realized that the building could
hold the 80 women the com-
mittee hopes to bring in next
year, but what about subsequ-
ent years in which an increas-
ing amount of women would
necessitate the college building
separate dorms, gym, and other
facilities?

As to the question of hiring
new faculty, he claims that this
is probably the key economic

issue. ‘‘That’s when the cost
will come.” he said. ‘'We're
just not equipped to handle

most of the majors women sel-
ect.

EPC Stands Firm
On Requirements

Vice President for Academic
Affairs John M. Bevan said this
week that the Educational Pol-
icy Committee (EPC) has re-
affirmed its position that ex-
tended studies programs must
be completed before a student
can be admitted to his next
year.

“‘We had some problem this
year with students who were
unclear on their obligations and
had to carry an incomplete in
extended studies over into the
next year of school,” Bevan
said.

“But from now on, all students
must pass their extended studies
requirements before they can
continue to the next grade,” he
said.

Bevan referred students to
Page 13 of the Academic Reg-
ulations for the standards of
progress which must be com.
pleted by students.
