THE DAVIDSONIAN, FEBRUARY 16, 1928

Old Red Tank Sold

to Monroe Concern

No longer will all-wise sophomores
paint freshman numerals on the water
tank; no longer will occupants of the
barracks be able to test their throwing
ability by hurling missiles over this old
landmark; energetic photographers will
be forced to seek a different vantage point
from which to snap pictures of the cam-
pus; and still again, the moonlight loving
poet will have to seek other places to re-
cline while delighting ‘in beautiful verse
as misty clouds float across the moon,
for the red water tank has been sold.

College officials recently completed ne-
gotiations with the Manette Mills, of
Monroe, N. C,, whereby this huge red
tank was disposed of and the purchasers
plan to begin removal of the structure
within the next few days.

The reason for the sale was that of the
useless place which the tank was held
during the past few years since water
is obtained from the city. The tank was

erected in 1917 by the K. D, Cold Manu-|

facturing Co., of Newnan, Ga. Its weight

is sixty tons and the capacity is eighty
thousand gallons,

championship a business meeting was

tion, which is affiliated with the Inter-
collegiate Glee Club Association, This
business meeting was attended by rep-
resentatives of the glee clubs that are
members of the Southern Glee Club As-
sociation. Professor Cullum; head of the
Music Department, and John S, Foster,
president of the Glee Club, attended the
