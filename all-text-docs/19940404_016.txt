UPDATE

NEW! V INTERLIBRARY LOAN & PHOTOCOPY REQUESTS ON-LINE
To.request an interlibrary loan book or photocopy, select #6 from the revised menu on CHAL and complete the loan

form on that screen. The request will be sent by e-mail to the interlibrary loan assistant in the Library who will then
process your request. You will be notified by e-mail or phone when it arrives.

NEW! V BOOK ORDERS ON-LINE (FOR FACULTY)
Faculty members may-place book and journal orders on-line. Select #6 from the CHAL menu and then complete the
form on that screen. This is easier than the previous on-line method, for there is an actual form to complete; you do

not have to remember all the details needed each time. The system prompts you for each item. This request will be
sent on-line to the Acquisitions Department in the Library for processing.

NEW! V CHRONICLE OF HIGHER EDUCATION
Selections from the CHRONICLE are available on-line each week. Select #3 on the new CHAL menu.
NEW! V JOURNAL CITATION INDEX

When using an author, title, or subject search (not keyword) on one of the periodical indexes (e.g. Reader's Guide),
check the bottom of the screen which will tell you if the Library subscribes to the journal in which the article is found.

Then press “H” (for holdings) to find out if the particular years of that journal are in the Library. This saves much time
in looking through the printed serials list each time.

NEW! Uv LIBRARY INFORMATION
Library hours, news about the Library, locations for items in the Library, etc. are available by selecting #6 on the
revised CHAL menu.

NEW! V APOLLO ACCESS

Now you can use a CHAL terminal in the Library to access your personal APOLLO account by selecting #7 on the

CHAL menu. We ask that you consider others and do not tie up the CHAL terminal if someone else needs access to
the Library’s holdings.
