Construction work finished just in time for seniors to move into the newest addition to Martin

Melrose Place?

Court apartments.

By Alex Crumbley

‘If it’s quiet, you can almost
hear the pound and_ring of con-
struction crews still echoing in its
brick and concrete halls. Martin
Court Apartment F, the newest
addition to the college skyline, was
completed just in time for seniors
to move in last weekend, and its
first residents are pleased with the
results.

It’s been called the nursing
home, the country club, the man-
sion, and Melrose Place. Martin

F’s visage is definitely unlike any- ‘

thing else on campus — with ad-

joining, wrap-around porches and
a grassy courtyard in the middle,
the building immediately gives the
feel of community living.

“T think’s it’s funny that we
can see the comings and goings of
almost every other apartment in
the building,” Anna Gray Ander-
son said Friday night as she en-
joyeda beverage on her front porch.
“It'll be hard to get away with
anything, if you know what I
mean.”

With the last minute rush put
on by the contracting company to
have Martin F'finished, a few de-

tails were overlooked or haphaz-
ardly done. A backwards elevator
button here and a disconnected
water heater there betray the build-
ers’ race against the clock.

But residents are just happy to
have a, place to live, especially
after three years of dorm life. Fi-
nally, the Residence Life Office
can guarantee all students an apart-
ment for their senior year. “I was
glad not to have to worry about
having an apartment. . . or maybe
end up with a single somewhere,”

said” T yohA Phitpott, ‘wresident of
“Polly Griffin.”

The building houses 90 stu-
dents in five-bedroom apartments,
each furnished with a full kitchen
and a three-sink bathroom. “It’s
an incredible setup we have here,”
said Brian Bentley, one of the
apartment’s two RA’s. “We took
a gamble signing up to live: here,
and it paid off.”

The Martin dwellers' only
complaint is the lighting in the
building. At night, Martin F looks
like the launch pad for the space
shuttle Challenger. Residents hope
the building will not explode.

All campus party
becomes a reality

By Russ Tarver

In order to facilitate relation-
ships between students, faculty and
staff; student government. Vice-
President Allison Sabel is follow-
ing through with her campaign
promise to organize an all-campus
party. Sponsored by the SGA,
Patterson Court Council, and the
College Union, the “Fall Festival”
will be held on Friday, September
9 and continue through Saturday,
September 10.

“There is a lack of communi-
cation between faculty, students,
and staff outside the classroom,”
says Sabel. She hopes that the Fall
Festival will help bridge the social
gap between the groups. “Every-
one will be included in the event.”

The Fall Festival is also in-
tended to unite Patterson Court
affiliates with independents. Ac-
cording to Sabel, “All fraternities
and eating houses will be a part of
this event and won’t be having

parties that weekend.” In the past,
Union-sponsored events during
weekends such as Spring Frolics
have been overshadowed by eat-
ing house and fraternity functions,
dividing independents and house
members.

Friday’s events will include a
student-faculty jazz mixer from 7-
9 p.m. and arock band from 9 p.m.
to 1 a.m. Both events will be held
on Richardson Plaza between
Chambers and Little Library.
“There will be lots of music and
lots of food,” says Sabel.

Saturday will be “Day at the
Lake.” Events at the lake campus
include the Freshman Regatta from
11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and live
music from 12:30 to 4 p.m. Lunch
will be provided. A 1950’s Rock
n’ Roll party will be held in Vail
Commons on Saturday night from
8 p.m. until 12 a.m. Beverages
provided at all functions will be
non-alcoholic.

New drop-add system
aims to reduce lines

Naat ith on

In early August, upperclass
students were given the opportu-
nity to drop or add 300 and 400
level courses over the phone. Ac-
cording to Griffin, the new process
was “smooth. ‘We had plenty of
calls.” Several hundred students
used the new phone system, and
many people called more than once
to check on the availability of cer-
tain courses.

The “most uncomfortable
part” of the new system, according
to Griffin was the “limited amount
of changes sophomores could

make.” Students were not allowed
to drop or add 100 and 200 level
courses over the phone because

the Registrar’s office “wanted to
make sure freshmen. would : get
courses.”

Even before the new phone
process, Griffin thinks the new reg-
istration procedures. were a suc-
cess: “Many more students than
usual got four courses.”

Freshmen went through drop-
add on Saturday, and upperclass-
men will go through drop-add to-
night. The process works differ-
ently this year, as students receive
a randomly assigned registration
time slot along with their course
schedule. Those times can be
traded if someone does not need to
use their slot.

SWIMMING AND DIVING TEAM

Initial meeting for all interested swimmers, divers, and team managers will be held at
4:00 p.m., mney August 29 in the Baker Sports Complex, lower level wrestling
room, or call the office at -2811 or -2812.
