THE DAVIDSONIAN

A LOOK AT...

By Bill Godwin

Just Biding His Time...

The man of leisure on campus these days is Coach
Bill Dole. “‘We’re waiting now for one boy to make up
his mind and we are through recruiting,” he said.

row afternoon, with the first of the two 7-inning stints
slated to begin at one-thirty. Then, next week, the ’Cats
will entertain Pfeiffer in a twinbill here on Tuesday be-

with a rugged class of 1963 and the polished flock of out-
standing '62 men.

Besides the 15 scholarship holders, Dole can count on
a dozen more freshmen. ‘There are four or five boys I
know about right now who will be playing football and
not receiving aid. Next fall we'll pick up six or seven
more from the freshman class. We think that we have
next year, all the way around, the best freshman group
we've had since the fall of °53.

“On scholarship we have some fine backs. We have
one very good quarterback and hope to have two by this
fall. We have some interior linemen—three tackles,
three guards and a center—that we think are all very
good football players.”

The majority of these players had no trouble what-
soever fulfilling their admissions requirements.

From Florida To West Virginia . . .

Recruiting takes time. But Dole got his bags packed
early and “had an opportunity to spend more time to
visit high schools, boys and their parents in a wider area.”

That area covered West Virginia, Virginia, the Caro-
linas, Georgia, Florida’ and Tennessee. Dole’s theater
ranged from Beckley, W. Va., to West Palm Beach, Fla.

The Fourth Quarter Collapse...

Most of Davidson’s eight losses in 1959 were marked
by “the fourth quarter collapse.”” With only one good unit,
the Wildcats could not hold out for 60 minutes against
teams which alternated two or three units. Injuries to
team captain Dave Warden and co-captain Charlie Ben-
son plagued the Wildcats all season long.

“We will have no outstanding boys this fall,” said
Dole. ‘But they are a group of boys who like to block and
tackle and play lot of football.”

Dole’s strategy is to play 26 or 27 boys each game.
This number would provide both offensive and defensive
units plus “‘a few boys in between.”

We hope there will be an end to “the fourth quarter
collapse.” .

He Hopes It’s Contagious . . .

Several Furman football players are on the Paladin

baseball team, which plays here tomorrow. Furman has|

been riddling its conference foes and now holds an 11-6
record. This prompted grid coach Bob King to say this
week, “I want them (his footballers) to know what it is
to win. That sort of thing is contagious.”

Four Misplaced Bean Balls . . .

Davidson's Dee Green, in a rare wild-pitching streak
Tuesday, gave up 14 runs to Wake Forest in less than five
innings. In the process, he hit four Deacon batters. We

would suggest that the righthander pick his targets more
carefully in the future. Student Council critics (including

The Davidsonian) would be better ones.

| Wildcats will face East Carolina,
High Point, Catawba, Washing-
ton & Lee, Lenoir Rhnye, Pem-
tee State, Guilford, Atlantic
|Christian, and Pfeiffer all of
whom participated in this meet
last year.

ROANOKE BEST?

In addition Roanoke will field
a team. Says Coach Heath Whit-
tle of Roanoke, ‘They will prob-
ably field the best team here on
Saturday.”

Davidson won this meet last
year by a score of 52% to 49
over East Carolina; High Point
was third with 34.

The list of events will include
five relays and six field events.
And Coach Whittle urges
“everybody to get out and see
this meet if possible.”

| Last Tuesday the Davidson
isquad suffered its second set-
|back of the season at the hands
lof V.P.1. by a score of 65% to
74% in Blacksburg, Va. Speed-
ster Ed Kizer raced to two vic-
tories, taking the 100 with a
time of 10.3 and the 220-yd.
dash in 22.7.

Davidson’s only other double
victor was Mike Laughlin who
jtook the hop-step-jump with a
jdistance of 42°10%". His broad
jump of 21 feet 6% inches was
also good for a first place.

Captain John Huie, a consis-
tent winner this season, vaulted
12 feet to cop the pole vault.
David Gilmour raced home in
4:32.1 to win in the mile.

BOGGS FILLS IN

In the absence of Captain
Stuart Nickles, Sophomore An-
dy Boggs came through with a
heave of 151 feet 5 inches and
a first in the javelin.

To round out the Wildcat vic-

tories for the day, the mile re-
jlay team claimed its event with
a time of 3:27.

| Saturday's High Point Relays
will be the last outing for the
Davidson tracksters before the
;Conference Meet which is to be
held May 13-14 at Williamsburg,
Va.

The Wildcats will be under-
dogs to highly favored Citadel
and strong Furman in this meet.

Tom.

At the Charlotte Country Club
last week, Tom stroked a two
under par 68, the lowest of the
year for the team. This week he
is named Wildcat of the Week.

CHARLOTTE EAGLE

Another feat Tom achieved
was also at the Charlotte Coun-
try Club. He made an eagle on
number two, a par four hole,

from 190 yards out, against
UNC.
Johnson, a senior, is from

Lookout Mountain, Tennessee.
A business administration ma-
jor, he has played golf three
years here. Before coming to
Davidson, he clubbed at the
Baylor Prep School.

MONEY MAN FAN

Like all golfers, he has a pro
to look up to. Without hesita-
tion he named Arnold Palmer,
currently the biggest money
winner. Hoping to pick up some
technique to improve his game,
Tom went down to Augusta to
watch Palmer in the Master's

Coach Ted Keesler said, “I
hope and think we will defeat
W&M.” As for the conference
tournament, Davidson has fin-
ished second for the last three
years,

Last year the Wildcat net-
ters finished second behind
George Washington although
being hard-pressed by the
Citadel. The team has lost
matches to both of these
teams earlier this spring.

Although Coach Keesler has

expressed desire to meet them

again, Davidson will probably
fall to third this year, behind
both George Washington and

The Citadel.

i Davidson lineup at Wil-
liamsburg will not change
from what it has been most
of the year. Doug Orr, Finley
Lee, Harry Broome, and Andy
Sherrill will hold down the
first four singles positions,
with Jim Hamilton, Stephan
Young and Bobby Snead fight-
ing it out for positions five
and six.

In the doubles the 'Cats will
have Orr and Lee, Broome and
Sherrill, and Young and Snead.
Coach Keesler feels that -the
players have improved much
since the early spring and al:
though the team ‘hasn't had too
much chance to compete this
week, they will be out there bat-
tling.” '

In last Friday’s loss to
UNC, only sophomore Steph-
an Young in the 6th position
was able to win a set as Dav-
idson lost all six singles and
the three doubles matches.

from their opponents, who are
noted mainly for a strong pitch-
ing staff.

Their pitchers must have been
really strong last week, when
the Paladins won four big games
by downing VPI and VMI in con-
secutive double-headers.

GREEN AND DAVES

As for Davidson’s plans for
the games, Stevens said, “I'll
pitch Dee Green in the first
one, and maybe Nick Daves in
the second.” He also indicated
that he will play about the same
team that has been starting all
year.

Last Friday, the ’Cats began
the Spring Frolics weekend
right by whipping Belmont Ab-
bey, 9-2. Team hitting as a whole
was very good, and sophomore
Nick Daves turned in an out-
standing performance on the
mound

WILDCATS CLOBBERED

However, Tuesday's game was
a different story as an outman-
ned Davidson team was clob-
bered by ACC powerhouse Wake
Forest, 26-7, in Winston-Salem.

Coach Stevens commented,
“We hit all right, but weak
pitching and terrible fielding
killed us.” It seems that the
‘Cats were throwing the ball
away, and to the wrong base
most of the afternoon, as they
committed seven errors.

TWO HOME RUNS

Pitching was also weak, as
Deacon batters raked three ‘Cat
hurlers for 23 hits, including
seven doubles, three triples, and
two home runs.

However, the Wildcats’ hitting
did provide a somewhat bright
spot to the dismal affair, as they
collected ten hits off Bob Plem-
mons, Wake’s ace righthander

Tommy Harris contributed two

Tuesday night, the Freshmen
travelled to Wingate Junior Col-
lege, where they were defeated
14:3. Playing at night for the
first time this season, the ‘"Kit-
tens dropped their fifth game
in six starts, and second in a
row to Wingate, who downed
