The season started out Saturday as
all good seasons should by overturning
the dope in several instances. Probably
the biggest surprise was the small score
made by V. M. L. against ‘Monk”
Younger’s Presbyterians. The cadets
could gain ground consistently but lack-
ed the final drive for a touchdown. A
place kick by Leech from the twenty-
yard line saved them from a tie. Hamp-
den-Sydney hits V. P. I. Saturday and
will be mighty lucky if they can get off

with as small a score.

Another upset was in the Virginia-
Randolph-Macon game. Reports are
current that the Orange and Blue have
a team as good as their 1915 squad and
a walk-away was expected. They were
able, however, to put across only a cou-
ple of touchdowns, one of which was

due toa fumble.

Southern football this season has the
best chance in its history to show up a
. few of the big Eastern teams, North
Carolina goes East this week, meeting
Rutgers Saturday and Yale.a week la-
ter. Rutgers won her game last week
34-0, while Carolina has not yet been
up against a college team. This will be
quite an advantage to Rutgers, but it is
hoped that Carolina can overcome this
handicap sufficiently to make a credit-
able showing.

* * #

At present the odds also seem to be
against the University of Virginia when
they meet Harvard. While the latter
was winning over Bates by eight touch-
downs, Virginia was being held to a 12-
© score by a team they should have
romped on without any trouble.

The biggest scores made by any teams
in the country were made by those we
tackle this season. A. & E. led the
whole list with the massacre of Guil-
ford. Georgia Tech came second by
beating Furtnan 74-0. Clemson also
was high in the list. The total scores
made by these three teams was 296 to
their opponents’ 0. The only teams we
face this year that failed to win Satur-
day are South Carolina and Furman,
both of whom were bucking other pros-
pective opponents which made necessary
the defeat of at least two.

It is gratifying to note that the ill
feeling between this college and Wake
Forest, which was so conspicuous several
years ago, has completely died out. Last
spring when the baseball team visited
there they were treated as cordially as
could be hoped for. The only regretta-
ble feature was the 14-0 score. This
year the football team brings back the

» same report. Both on the field and on
the campus the students and players
showed a sportsmanlike spirit which
could not be excelled anywhere.

* *® @#

The reports received from Clemson
indicate that Friday’s game is probably
the hardest the Wildcats will have dur-
- ing the month of October. Tigers and
Wildcats have never lost any love on
each other and there is bound to be a
bloody scrap when they get together.
The defeat of last year has not been

forgotten and revenge will be mighty/[ning.

“Wooley” Grey’s Assistant
Coaching in Football Much
Appreciated

Has Rendered Valuable Service in
Getting Lineman in Proper Shape

Davidson has always been fortunate
in having so many alumni who are will-
ing to come back and help coach her
teams. This year’s fuotball squad is
especially to be congratulated on having
“Wooley” Grey to assist Coach Cray-
ton in rounding them into shape.

“Wooley” played guard on David-
son's football team for four years, 1914,
15, '16 and '17, winning a letter his
last three years. Although he was a
universally fine player during his entire
college course, it was in 1917 that he
did his best work. In this year he was
mentioned for All-American honors.
He was also a star track man, winning
his “D” for four consecutive years in
this sport. During these years he
smashed all Davidson records for the
discus throw and shot put.

During the past year he has . been.
engaged in the work of coaching all
athletics at Bailey Military Institute.
He succeeded in turning out unusually
successful teams under war conditions
existing at that time.

“Wooley” has worked hard and faith-
fully on this year’s line men, and any
success they may attain will be in large
measure due to his efforts. By his work
he has not only helped the prospects of
the line, but has enabled Coach Cray-
ton to devote more individual attention
to the ends and backfield men.

The students of Davidson owe
“Wooley” no small debt of gratitude
and their hearty thanks and best wishes
go with him as he returns to his work
at Bailey.

NEW PLAN TO BE TRIED IN
PRE-VARSITY ‘BASKETBALL.

As a preliminary to class basketball,
inter-dormitory basketball games are
being planned. Every afternoon there
is a squad of men on the floor in the
new Gym. practicing, and it is hoped to
organize these teams according to their
respective dormitories. The games will
be played during the month of October,
in the afternoon, so that they will not
interfere with any work.

No men will be barred from playing
on any team. Men who have made
their “‘D” in basketball will be eligible.
Teams from Rumple, Watts, Georgia,
North Wing Chambers, South Wing
Chambers and Louisiana will compete.

There are varsity men in every build-
ing and these men will be used as the
nucleus around which the teams will be
formed, ;

Mr. Miles has formulated this plan
and he will have charge of the entire
arrangements. With a scrappy series as
this for an opener, class basketball
ought to create more interest and be
faster than ever before.
