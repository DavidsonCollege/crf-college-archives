Time For A Change

With the teams of Coaches Lefty
Driesell and Homer Smith, Davidson's
athletic fortunes have reached heights
undreamed of 10 years ago. The bas-
ketball team has become a national
power and the footballers. while still
no major threat to big-time teams,
are at least respectable and no longer
the laughing stock of the Southern
Conference. :

A corollary of losing athletic teams
is dissatisfaction and the accompany-
ing call for changes of one sort or
another. Before Coach Smith’s com-
ing to Davidson in 1965. there was
considerable talk of withdrawing sub-
Sidization to football, which had not
had a winning season in years. Today
such talk is unheard of; the question
of subsidized vs. non-subsidized ath-
letics is apparently a dead one.

But it's not dead. And the fortunes
of one’s teams have nothing to do with
the rightness of the situation. Either
it’s right or it’s wrong for a school of
Davidson’s type to offer scholarships
to athletes solely on how well they
throw a football or dribble a basket-
ball. We happen to think that it’s
wrong. And we hope that the trustees,
when they meet next month, will take
firm action on the situation to bring
policies of the Athletic Department
in line with those of Davidson’s edu-
cational aims.

_In going to a non-subsidized pro-
gram during a winning period. the
college can say as a small liberal arts
school that it’s wrong for a student
to receive a full scholarship solely on

athletic prowess. It's been the exper-
ience of several Southern schools,
such as Southwestern and Sewanee,
that superior competition forced them
into non-subsidized program; they
were driven by necessity.

Davidson has proved that it can
compete with schools its size and even
bigger. Now is the time, while we're
ahead, to take the step. Why wait un-
til we have the same type of team
Davidson had in the early 1960's,
when we will have no choice?

Athletics, at least in a school of
Davidson’s size and type, are for the
education of the student body, not for
big business, as is the case in large
universities. When athletic teams
reach the big-time and become as suc-
cessful as Davidson's have, they can
easily come to dominate other, more
important aspects of the academic life.
Such a situation does not exist here,
but it is entirely possible that it may
come in the future.

As a small, liberal arts college, Da-
vidson should concentrate on com-
peting with other schools of its own
size and type, fielding teams of stu-
dents who play solely from an enjoy-
ment of the game and a pride in their
school, not because they're receiving.
$1,800 a year to play. ; ;

We are interested in seeing David-
son grow, as are the trustees. A pro-
gressive athletic policy would be a
major st¢ép forward in making the col-
lege one of the outstanding liberal
arts schools in the country, of which
so much is heard.

A Vital Improvement

This week’s chapel speakers may
not have indicated any significant. im-
provement over past years, but the
chapel environment has infinitely im-
proved. The new J. Spencer Love
Auditorium will undoubtedly be one
of the most valuable physical improve-
ments to the college plant .for years
to come (barring the possibility of a
new librarv, of course).

Its designers have succeeded in con-
structing an auditorium that is func-
tional, attractive and comfortable.

It is in the expanded range of func-
tions that the greatest benefit will
come to the college. Only now is there
a location with adequate seating for
the entire student body that is suitable
for such programs as full-scale thea-
trical productions and films. The large
stage and improved dressing Tooms
would do credit to any theater, as
would the new sound and lighting
systems.

Equally important are improved
conditions for the audience — padded
seats (without hymnbook racks, even),
air conditioning, the absence of glar-
ing sunlight.

But all is not well. One minor im-
provement would be to have at least
some light on the speaker’s face, as
well as in front and behind him. -

More serious is the defect that. be-

came painfully obvious during Tues-
day’s assembly: The bell mechanisms
emit a series of painful groans, to the
embarrassment of the speaker. It
seems there should be more subtle
and equally effective ways of inform-
ing a speaker that his time is up.

Sunshine

This week’s ray of sunshine: Seniors
worried about what to do Homecom-
ing (if indeed anyone does) need wor-
ry no more. Your problems are solved.
While others sleep Friday night off
Saturday morning and while others
watch The Citadel march to defeat
Saturday afternoon, a number of more
fortunate members of the Class of
’67 will be determining their future,
in the form of the Graduate Record
Exam.

Apparently such a coincidence (?) is
unavoidable. (With only three home
games, there’s not much leeway in
determining when Homecoming will
fall.)

But: alas, remember you'll appre-
ciate what’s left even more. A com-
forting thought.

But On The Inside

Anyone taking his first look at the
1966-67 reference catalogue might
think a long-needed overhaul had been
made. The new cover and altered for-
mat suggest change, but closer inspec-
tion reveals that this is as deep as the
change goes. One could argue wheth-
er the external changes are an im-
provement; we happen to think not,
though they may appeal to others.

But it is senseless to undertake
such an extensive project and leave
the actual content of the book vir-
tually untouched, particularly in light
of the significant changes undergone
at Davidson in the past years.

The most obvious inclusion is the
defense of the vespers service. Copy
for the book doubtless has to be made
up in the spring, well ahead of pub-
lication, but at the same time, a
change of such importance deserves
special treatment in order to make
the book correct. On page 45, one
finds references to the Red and Black
Masquers, which were just reorgan-
ized in Spring 1966.

Likewise, reference to rush regu-
lations are incorrect, and there are a
number of minor inaccuracies, all add-
ing up to a sloppy book.

The reference catalogue goes out
to virtually every high school guid-
ance office in the East and is often a
high school senior’s main source of
information about the college. The
college would do well to put more in-
to the content of next year's edition
and concentrate less on its appear-
ance.

Stop

Despite talk of the Industrial Revo-
lution coming to Davidson (in forms
such as the General Time plant), the
town is still a hamlet, isolated from
the mainstream of commerce in the
area.

Consequently, such devices as traf-
fic lights serve no useful function,
other than as a source of consterna-
tion for motorists who must often

waith 20 seconds at a light, during
which traffic is virtually nonexistent.

Devices such as flashing caution
and stop lights or even simple stop
signs would function just as well as
stop lights, without causing any traf-
fic congestion.

Dear Editor:

Rev. Russell Montford gave.
an enjoyable and quick-witted
address in chapel Monday. His
somewhat satirical analysis of
Playboy magazine kept his au-
dience awake, and his quick
wrapup in favor of the tradi.
tional Christian ethic gave one
time to get to Mary’s before
third period.

However. I feel that in his
address he was superficial and
unfair in his criticism of the
magazine.

Certainly, if one reads only
the advertisements, the all-too-
present features on the latest
fashion and the occasional
story of liquors and cheese. he
would come to believe that the
editorial approach of Playboy
was shallow and appealed to
the less substantial values in
society.

However, if one reads the
magazine with greater care,
he finds that this is not true.
Playboy contains such addi-
tional features as the month-
ly “Playboy Interview." This
feacure. with its candid inter-
views of such figures as Tim-
othy Leary. Dylan Thomas and
Ralph Ginzburg, allows these
men to bring their views be-
fore the public without unfair
slant or bias.

Playboy does have its weak-
nesses. It is often guilty of at-
tempting to build only an im-

age. It also has its strengths,
for it is one of the few na-
tional publications which are
willling to promote or publi-
cize a new or unconventional
attitude or idea.

This willingness to seek the
truth even where it does not
seem to confurm to traditional
or accepted beliefs has always
been cherished as a virtue
among men who esteem intel-
lectual excellence. Perhaps if
Rev. Montford would read fur-
ther, he would join his Epis-
copal colleagues in defending
Hef's bunny.

Change Requested

In Library Hours

Dear Editor:

While I realize that there
are many ailments and prob-
lems on this campus that most
would consider more serious.
one problem has reared its
ugly head in these first weeks
of school, a problem which
weighs upon the heads of all.

I refer, of course, to the
Sunday library hours. Inas-
much as the Vespers farce has
been .ended. and inasmuch as
Hattie’s is closed all day Sun-
day (as is the Anchor), there
seems little for one to do on
the day of rest other than

OVER

spend one’s time in the iibra-

At the present time Sunday
hours for the library are °2-5
p.m. and 8:30-12 p.m. This
seems a bit anachronistic.
Why not leave the library open
between 5 p.m. and 8:30 p.m?

Of course, if such a move
would mean that we would
have to cut any part of our
subsidized athletic program to
obtain the funds necessary to
keep the library open during
these hours, I would have to
withdraw my request.

Malamud’s ‘The Fixer’

Echoes Russian Themes

A Review
By SAM DARBY
Staff Writer

“I am in history. yet not in
it. In a way of speaking I am
far out. it passes by me. Is
this good, or {is it something
lacking in my character?

“What a question! Of course
lacking but what can I do
about it? And besides is this
really such a great worry?
Best to say where one is, un-
less he has something in his
life.

“*He understood history and
also because he had ideas to
give it. Nobody can bum an
idea even if they burn the
man.

“On the other hand there
was the activist, Jan de Witt,
Spinoza’s friend and benefac-
tor, a good and great-man who
was torn to pieces by the
Dutch mob who were suspi-
cious of him although he was
innocent. Who needs such a
fate?"

Ts it that most Russians are
lonely people or simply that
so many books about Russians
concern lonely people? Paster-
nak, Dostoyevsky, Chekov—
they all wrote about men
searching for an identity. One
wonders if: all Russians have
the same longings.

The quoted passage could be

from any of the Russian writ-
ers, but it is from The Fixer,
a new book by Bernard Mal-
amud.

The fixer is a Russian Jew
who was imprisoned for a mur-
der he did not commit. Yakov
Bok is a sensitive man who
gave up his religion in search
of a historical identity. He was
poor and lived by repairing
things (thus the title) in an at-
tempt to support himself and
‘his wife.

When she left him, he trav-
eled to Kiev. hoping to learn
about life and perhaps to pros-
per. Through a rather incred-
ibte sequence of events he be
came the manager of a brick
factory in a non-Jewish sec-
tor of the city.

When a small boy was mur-
dered in a cave nearby. he
was arrested and accused of
kiling the boy as part of a
Jewish ritual, He then began
his three years imprisonment
in which he found a self-reali-
zation through injustice.

The book ends triumphant-
ly not because he was freed,
but because he discovered him-
self.

The theme is universal. In
the very name Bok we find an
allusion to Job. He did not
have to be Russian or Jewish
—he could have been a Puerto
Rican living in the West Side

of New York and the result
would have been the same:
the theme would still! come
through. All that is needed is
a minor social being, the vic-
tim of social injustice.

However, Malamud seems to
be writing in the Russian tra-
dition. From Yakov's search
for identity to the tedious de-
scriptions of his imprisonment.
there are continuous echoes
from the great Russian writ-
ers.

His style has evidently not
yet matured. Sometimes he
handles words well. as when
Yakov was thinking about his
fate: “And from him to his
daughter with the crippled leg
was only one crippled step. and
then another into the brick-
yard. And a crippled hop into
jail.”

But at other times Malamud
presses his luck, as with “‘Af-
fter his manacled march
through the snowy Streets, the
mutterings of the crowd. and
the terrdle .. .”’ Fortunately
his filgh:s of itlteration are not
numerous, and most of the
book .is written in straightfor-
ward prose.

This book will not soar in
popularity, but neither will it
be forgotten. It is a contem-
porary work cn an ageless
theme that will be studied by
generations to come.

The Gospel

According
To John

By JOHN BAILEY

Associate Editor :

This Makes It Worth It

There comes a time when you really do know
it’s worthwhile and that’s why it's important to stick
with it.

Few things strike us with the force that is held
by one’s entrance into the final year of college.
Everyone must approach the last year with mixed
feelings which neither speak loudly enough to be
clearly audible nor remain quiet enough to allow us
to forget them.

* % *

BY THIS TIME we are aware of our capabilities
and our limitations. Somehow setting the world on
fire may not be quite.as important as it once was. Or
is it that we have forgotten? Have we forgotten the
anticipation with which we embarked upon our col-
lege education, the drive, the desire? I think not.

_ _ The senior has just become a little more realistic
in his outlook. His drive and desire may be greater
than ever before. But now the import of all his hopes
and dreams is drawn into a much more concrete
perspective than he has known. The change is a grad-
ual one, but its impact may be very sudden.

__ “The considerations you, as a senior, must take
into account are no longer to be held in abeyance
with the hope you won’t have to decide in the end.
Now you have to make your own decisions, and even
deciding which graduate school to attend will bind
you more than ever to your life’s vocation.

s *

1 WONDER how many of us realize what we
leave behind? We no longer are allowed to place our-
selves at the mercy of imagination and emerge atop
a different dream every day. We have gone bevond
the “‘you.can never go home again stage.” The “Soph-
omore Slump” is behind us, and the era of argument
and protest is gone with the junior year. What is
left for the senior to keep him stirring and make
his the best year of all?

I think that the “senior attitude” is what is most
important. This is a great part of what makes one’s.
college education so meaningful. When you have pro-
gressed this far things about the College assume a
very different meaning, contrasting sharply the atti-
tudes you once may have held about them.

__ When you are a senior your lot is cast with Da-
vidson College. and. you begin to discover that it
reallv is a pretty fine place to get an education. You
see its problems, so many problems. Yet the prob-
lems are no longer something to sit around and gripe
about or even get up and protest over. Now the prob-
lems are something to be concerned over: The con-
cern must express itself in a-search for some kind of
solution in the area of one’s interest.

s *

WE ALL RECOGNIZE that every place has its
problems, and Davidson is no exception. But as sen-
lors we are able for a moment to look bevond these
disruptions to the potential and spirit of the place
where we study. For once we begin to realize that the
long hours of study, the short week-ends and the
failures and successes we have known are all a part

of making us appreciate “the Davidson experience.”

It is this concern and respect which makes us
glad to be a part of Davidson College and at the same
time recognize our indebtedness to it. Now we are
able to point with real pride toward our College. We
know finally that there is much we would change.

but there is much mor d ¢
being proud of. e well worth retaining and

WE KNOW WHY “it was worth it” when a little
extra effort (or maybe a whole lot) brought usa feel-
ing of accomplishment. We know now why people
are willing to spend their lives trying to make David-
son College a better place to get an education. We
know why people are interested in coming back here
after graduation for things like Homecoming. We
know what it means to say with pride, “I go to David-
son. More important, we know in our own minds

at we have. at last, something of a very personal
understanding of what constitutes this pride.
