Dr. Whaling

Delivers Lecture On

“The Making Of Woodrow Wilson”

Interesting Address on the Characteristics and Forces that Have Made the|Clark Strikes Out Seventeen Men, Allowing Five Hits. Second Inning was
Former Davidson Student a World Leader.

One of the most enjoyable events. of
the college year at Davidson, for the
students and townspeople as well, was
the lecture delivered by Dr. ‘Thornton
Whaling, president of Columbia Theo-
logical Seminary, on Monday morning.
The subject of the address was “The
Making of Woodrow Wilson.” Dr.
Whaling was a oollegefellow of our
President at Davidson College, and
since that time has been an intimate ac-
quaintance of him; consequently he was
better able to make the life history more
vivid.

He began by showing. the supremeness
of the making of a character and by nam-
ing the four great forces which act in
the formation thereof. ‘Then in a most
picturesque manner he applied the life of
this singular world character to these
forces,

In his discussion and application of
the first of these, Heredity, the speaker
traced Wilson's ancestry, which was ex-
clusively Scotch-Irish. . He expressed it
as the cream of Scotland which had been
skimmed oft of that country and placed
in northern [feland, all of whom «were
highly cultured and very learned.. Many
were political and religious leaders of
the twa countries. In fact, Dr. Whaling
says that “the Scotch were a_ political
and religious people, and the Wilson and
Woodrow lines were merged—not
sprinkled—in this profound doctrne, for
four centuries at least.

In the second place a most interesting
and entertainng account of the Educa-
tion was given. The first and greatest of
Woodrow Wilson's teachers was his own
father. Very touching was the account
of a visit to Columbia Seminary by the
President only a few years ago. He went
to his father’s classroom where as a
small boy he had gone to listen to the
greath truths which his boyish mind de-
lighted to think upon. Then to the
chapel room where he recalled to mind
the great orators of former days, chief
among whom was his own father. On
this same visit Dr. Whaling said that
he asked the President if he remembered
his college days at Davidson, and he re-
plied that “The year at Davidson Col-
lege was the happiest of all his college
career.’ This introduced a brief account
of those days here and were of special
interest, of course, to the audience. A
very vivid picture was painted of a base-
ball game between the scrub nine and
a delegation from some countryside,
when in the ninth inning with the coun-
try lads in the lead. Wilson, who had
reached third base and might have
brought in the winning run, came totter-
ing in home very nonchalantly to be put
out and get a very impressive tongue-
lashing from the captain of the scrub
team. Then came his days as a student
of Princeton, which as Dr. Whaling ex-
pressed it, is Dayidson enlarged. Here
he was further trained under the influ-
ence of the old Scotch environment

Wildcats Take Second from Elon 2 to 1
Doubles Championship {Greater Davidson Club
To Hall and Spence To Be Organized
To Make Davidson Bigger, Better

Cunningham Brothers Their Opponents
In Finals. Good Form Displayed.

W. F. Hall and T. H. Spence are the
Davidson champions in tennis doubles
and compose a team of which we may
well feel proud. Our only regret is
that this team is not entered in some
inter-collegiate match this Spring. Hall
won his “D" this year as singles cham-
pion, and Spence has a splendid chance
to win his letter next year.

Seven teams were represented in the
doubles tournament last week. These
teams were arranged in two groups for
the preliminaries and semi-finals. In
the preliminaries of the first group Cun-
ningham and Cunningham defeated Or-
mand and Ormand 6-4, 6-2 and Mc-
Keldin and Miller defeated Kornegay
and Wilkinson 6-3, 6-3. In the second
group Hall and Spence defeated Woods
and Price 6-3, 6-3.

vidson? Sure you do, every true son of
Davidson docs. ‘The question is what
are you doing to make it a better and a
greater Davidson? “Not much,” you
will answer probably, Now.,\ here is the
point, separately and working alone you
cannot do much, but if you had three
hundred others warkiite with you — it
would help a whole lot, wouldn't it?
Why, sure it would.

Every college or university is now
planning a progressive, active program,
now that the war is over, and you may
he sure Davidson is not behind the times.
The University of North Carolina,
Washington and Lee University and the
University of Virginia are a few of. them
that have organized for real work. They
are arganized to boost their school and to
