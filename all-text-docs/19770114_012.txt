EQGUS continued Distrust mars program

By KEVIN SHELLY
Special Projects Editor

Consciousness III has with-
ered away, Jack Bevan is a
memory, and educational in-
novation is on the line as
“Blue Sky’’ turns foreboding
grey in the cynical ’70’s. The
issue is the life, death or trans-
formation of the Extended
Studies Program.

In the more innocent and
idealistic atmosphere of the
*60’s Extended Studies was
implemented by then Vice
President of Academic Af-
fairs, Jack Bevan, as part of a
comprehensive program to
provide wider outlets for aca-
demic exploration. However,
the reaction against non-tra-
riculum has set in,
by the Educational Policy
Committee’s reexamination of
all those areas lumped under
the category of ‘‘Blue Sky”’
programs.

The first to come under the
gun is Extended Studies, the
program that offers the most
leeway to each student to do
what he wants under the guid-
ance of a faculty member. But
the other programs are in for
similar treatment.

There has been a lot of talk
about the lax nature of many
projects that come under the
aegis of Extended Studies, so
much so that this may seem to
be the central issue in the
argument against Extended
Studies and plans for its
change or demise.

However, the central issue,
although never stated openly,
is just how much the faculty
trusts each other to sponsor
only quality work and elimi-
nate the slipshod.

Faculty members are free
under the terms of Extended
Studies to accept or reject
proposals for projects and
they can stipulate certain min-
imum requirements for all the

work they undertake and are |

under no obligation to take on
this responsibility. (The maj-
ority of the members of the
EPC do not sponsor Extended
Studies.)

What it boils down to is that
some faculty members feel
that other members of the
faculty are incapable of dem-
anding a certain level of
quality from the students they
are supposedly guiding in
these projects. Perhaps this
distrustful, cynical attitude is
for the best because if changes
are instituted which require
minimal standards the prog-
ram will be the stronger for it.

To terminate the program at
this point would be like killing
a patient if he shows any sign
of illness.

The second argument that is
bandied about is that taking
on Extended Studies projects
places a great strain on profes-
sors’ course loads. This can be
true, but once again it is at
each professor’s discretion to
determine the number of proj-
ects accepted and each profes-
sor is free to limit the number
that are undertaken every
term.

Some departments even
mandate the maximum num-
ber that each professor may
sponsor. A professor in one of
the departments with the hea-
viest student loads accepts a
number of Extended Studies
students every semester inter-
ested in areas that overlap
with the research he is invol-
ved in.

Perhaps ‘Extended Studies
would not be seen as a burden,
but rather a boon, if more
faculty members were actively
involved in research projects.
Professors can benefit from
the efforts of students they
sponsor if they wish to and are
free to reject any and all
burdensome projects.

If slack projects have been
done by students in the past it
is because a member of the
faculty has agreed to sponsor
them, not because the prog-
ram has been designed to
allow students an easy way
out of regular courses.

The question then is what to
do to correct abuses and
require quality work from
Extended Studies Programs.

A possible solution is to
eliminate Extended Studies
all-together and rely on inde-
pendent studies to fill the gap,
but this is an imperfect solu-
tion because some depart-
ments, such as history, do not
offer independent studies. The
interdisciplinary nature of Ex-
tended Studies will be lost,

psychologically if not in real-
ity, by relying on major
departments to bridge all the
areas that Extended Sudies
now encompasses.

An independent study only
system would mean greater
numbers of students that. will
try to register for independent
studies as course offerings
decrease and once again un-
derclassmen will be effectively
eliminated from participating
in independent studies.

If a major has been pre-

_determined before entrance in-

to college this should be no
cause for concern, but ideally,
and perhaps naively, a liberal
arts education is supposed to
stimulate exploration of the
self, values, and presupposi-
tions.

If this process were confined
to junior and senior year by
keeping underclassmen from
participating, the purpose of a
liberal arts education would be
sacrificed to expediency.

Because the program that
has arisen with the program is
primarily that faculty mem-
bers do not trust other faculty
members, it would seem that
the obvious solution is to
implement some controls that
would hold faculty members
accountable for sponsoring
work of a certain minima! level
of quality.

First the number of projects
each professor undertakes
should be regulated so that
some faculty members are not

obviously overextending
themselves, as has occurred in
the past.

This can be done either
through the departments or
the faculty as.a whole, but it
should be taken into consider-
ation all of a professor’s
obligations to the college com-
munity, not just course load,
and departmental decisions
would be more desirable if all
obligations were to be consid-
ered.

Tt's only a

Gods sake!

Another possible corrective
measure is to require a written
mid-term report, drawn up
jointly by the professor and
the student he is’ sponsoring,
to be submitted to the Direc-
tor of Extended Studies: This
would require closer observa-
tion of the projects by profes-
sors and would force certain
minimal achievements, as per
the contract signed, to be met.

Each week in Focus The
Davidsonian will examine one
issue of campus-wide interest
from a variety of angles and
approaches. Next week’s topic
is crime and security in both
town and college. By announc-
ing the topic in advance each
week we hope to start the
community thinking in this
area and hope that any infor-
mation or suggestions will be
volunteered by seeing one of
the editors or leaving it in the
Focus Box in our office.
