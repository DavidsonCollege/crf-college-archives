Davidson Closes Season

With Wake Forest Five

State Championship as Reward

CLOSED CAREERS

FOUR MEN

Deacons to Present Fast Quintet
For Younger’s Men

Davidson's five will wind up whaf? can
certainly be called a successful season, next
Wednesday night against Wake Forest in
the Davidson gym. It is the first time for
a long period that Wake Forest has played
Davidson here, but after much dickering
between officials, it was decided to bring
the game to the campus. Davidson students
will appreciate this more, for. this will be
the first Big Five game the Wildcats have
played at home. ,

It is possible that the Wildcats will go
into this game with the Big Five title at
stake, and then again it may be just another
Big Five Game, but it any case, it’s against
Wake Forest, and that means a fight. Five
red-clad basketeers will take the floor de-
termined to do what a Wildcat machine
couldn’t do on the gridiron.

Wake Forest, after having a weak begin-
ning, has been improving every game, until
last week when they reached a peak by
trouncing N. C. State and moving them
down the ladder in the Big Five race. The
Deacons have a strong, rough outfit, which
makes the going tough for opponents, and
often wins over better skilled opponents.

Brogden, star end in the fall, is now a
star forward and has played prominently
in all of the Deacons’ games. Carp and Joy-
ner, forwards, play fast floor games and
Joyner is a dead shot at the basket, as was
shown in his garnering 14 points against
Elon in a recent encounter. Webb, a big,
husky center, is a tower of strength on both
offense and defense. Edwards and Owens
hold down the guard positions in fine style.

Rusk, Goodson, Proctor and Wilson, vet-
eran Wildcat basketeers, will be playing their
last game for Davidson.

Gardner May Make
A Fullback Position

Buddy Gardner, sensational Sophomore
center of the Davidson Wildcat football team
last fall, will in all likelihoodbe one of Da-
vidson’s chief backfield threats next fall. If
he continues to display the type of football
that he has so far shown in the winter
workouts, Coach Tilson feels that Gardner
will prove a real discovery and that the
shifting of the stellar lineman to a back-
field place will be more than justified. He
will have a chance to show as a back Sat-
urday afternoon, when the first practice game
of Davidson's winter training program will

be held.

Davidson’s mentors, in search of more and

bigger ball carriers, went into a huddle at
the start of spring training and hit upon
the idea of moving Gardner from a center
to fullback. The change is not so revolu-
tionary in the Atlanta boy’s case, as his
most sensational work was done in backing
up the line and batting down passes, and
diagnosing plays on the defense. He will, of
course, have even better opportunity to do
this as a fullback. He has shown himself to
be adept at carrying the ball, and is an al-
most perfect blocker and interference run-
ner.
Another shift made in search of more
backfield material is the change of O'Keefe,
Freshman end, to halfback. O’Keefe played
a fine game at end on the Wildkitten team
last fall, but he lacked weight to develop
into a stellar performer at that place. His
speed suggested his moving-to the backfield,
and he has shown up nicely there.

The remaining other important develop-
ment brought out after the first three weeks’
work is the changing of Don King to the
signal calling place, where he is working
with West, Freshman quarterback. King

. was mentioned on several occasions last fall

as a quarterback, but he remained at the
halfback position all season. It is likely that
he will be Davidson’s first-string sigrial-
caller next September, as he cannot only
do things in the way of ball-toting, but has
shown plenty of football brains combined
with a world of common sense that fits him
for a good field general.

Marrow Goes Up 7

Buck Marrow, former Davidson
College ace twirler, may get his
chance in the Big Time baseball
pastures this spring and summer, At
least his work with the Beaumont
(Texas) club, to which he was
farmed by Detroit last spring, was
such that he has been odered to
leave his home at Tarboro Monday
for Sacramento, Calif., where the
early spring cavorting grounds of
the Tigers are located.

Marrow went to Texas last year,
and combined determination with
his natural ability to wn 18 game,
losing eght in the meantime. Detroit

offcials thought this was good
enough for a look-over with the
regulars. Thus, Marrow goes to

California, and his showing during
the next couple of months will de-
termine whether he will be playing
with the Michigan club, or will
again be farmed out for more sea-
soning and instruction.

Wildcats Defeated by
Duke Blue Devils, 24-6

Coach Doc Unger’s Wildcat grapplers put
up a bitter fight here last Saturday night,
February 14, but they were defeated by their
foemen, the Duke Blue Devils. Davidson
had only two time advantages, while Duke
came through with three falls and three
time advantages, giving them ‘the contest
with a score of 24 to 6.

Ed Gorham, of the 126-pound class, was
the first man to take a decision for David-
son, as he won over Williams with a com-
fortable time advantage of 8 minutes and
15 seconds. The only other match won by
Davidson was taken by Captain Pie Con-
way, who defeated Hughes with a time ad-
vantage of 3 minutes and 46 seconds. Per-
haps this was the most interesting event of
the evening, due to the fact that Conway
was outweighed almost 50 pounds, and the
apparent ease with which he overcame this
handicap was quite a thrill for the audi-
ence. However, there was evidence of much
uneasiness on the part of the Davidson fans
when Hughes managed to work in a double
wristlock which was indeed an- effort for
Conway to break.

Gamble, Thomas, and Atkins all pinned
their men: Vick of the 116-pound class,
Ashcraft of the 145-pound class; and Mc-
Fadyen of the 175-pound class, respectively.
Both Gamble and Atkins used the half-nel-
son as their pinning holds, while Thomas
pinned Ashcraft using the double arm bar.
The three other wins for Duke were time

Coach “Tex” Tilson is working daily with
a squad of about fifty men. He is being ably
assisted in instructing the candidates by
Coach Laird of the Freshman team, Captain
Walter Fraley, Tom Brohard, Charley
Parker, and Hub Covington, all of the 1930
varsity. The work so far has been confined
to drills in blocking, tackling, punting, pass-
ing, field running, and line scrimmage, but
beginning next week two practice games
between two teams picked from the candi-
dates will be held each week.

Jack Wagner, varsity tackle, and Reid
Brown, Freshman fullback, have not reported
because of injuries sustained last fall, while
several other varsity men and promising
candidates, who are busy at wrestling, bas-
ketball, and track, have not reported.

State Gets Revenge on
~Davidson Quintet, 30-23

Wildcats Hold Superiority During
First Half, Leaving Court With
15-11 Lead

GAMMON STAR AT NIGHT

Martin, Center, Leads Davidson’s
' Scoring With Eight Points

The Red Terror quint of N. C. State,
out for revenge for the drubbing they had
received at the hands of the Wildcats earlier
in the season, came from behind in  bril-

liant fashion to down the fighting Davidson |

five, 30 to 23. The game was played at
State on February 13. This win displaced
the Wildcats from top place in the state
championship race, and regained for N. C.
State the lead. :

The Wildcat quint showed marked supe-
riority in the first half, with more than half
of the first period gone, they were leading
11 to 3. At half time, the Davidson five
left the floor leading 15 to 1),

The State five entered the second half a
rejuvenated outfit and, led by the brilliant
Gammon, Red Terror forward whose 14
points was high for the night, they stepped
out in front and: stretched their lead
seven points by the end of the game.

Gammon was the star of the night, both in
shooting and floor work, chalking up six
field goals and two foul shots to gain 14
points. For the Wildcats, Martin led with
eight points.

According to how the Duke game came
out Tuesday, Davidson now either
knocking at the very door of a State
championship, or has been pushed back
completely out of the picture. A’ victory
over Duke, we believe, would place the
Wildcats in the favorite’s position to win.
And therefore, if Duke
Tuesday night, she is now riding the crest
of aewave. If not, she has been left in the
backwash while others rush on towards a
title.

But regardless of what the result of that
game was, most interest is now centered
on the Wake Forest game here Wednes-
day. For its possible championship bear-
ing it is highly nteresting. On account of
the fact that three members of the team
and a fourth squad member will be play-
ing their last games for Davidson it will
be attractive. But above all, because Dav-
idson is meeting Wake Forest, the gym-
nasium will be packed.

So far, Wake Forest has shown very
little. Her defeat of State the other night
is the crowning jewel of her crown, and
it is regarded as only a huge upset. One
team was off form; the other played over
its head and took advantage of every-
thing. But her past performances do not
mean a thing in this case. All it will be
will be Davidson vs. Wake Forest, and
that changes everything.

Davidson beats

The Baptists would like nothing better
than to knock the Wildcats from a pos-
sible title, if they get the chance. David-
son would wish for nothing better than
to beat Wake Forest, no matter if both

iteams were tied for the cellar. So things

for next Wednesday look warm, One of
the best games of the season should re-
sult,

The team is at present off on its long-
est trip of the season into South Caro-
lina, meeting three teams. This week has
been a most strenuous one for the var-
sity, and they will deserve a lay off when
they get home.

Three members of Davidson regular
five will be playing heir last game as
Wildcats next Wednesday night. Capt.
Bill Goodson, one of the prettiest basket-
ball players ever to don a Davidson uni-
form, Jim Proctor, an ideal running mate,
and Dean Rusk, highly consistent for-
ward are the three men who will take
the floor for the last time. Boots Wilson,
squadman for three years, will also be
closing his career for Davidson.

Concerning Goodson, the Charlotte Ob-
server said, “In Goodson, captain, David-
son has one of the best guards in south-
ern basketball. The Lincolnton youth has
performed spectacularly all seasons and
played a part in defeating North
Carolina last week.” Concerning Proctor,
the same paper said, “the two make one
of the best goal guarding combinations
imaginable.”

big

The “big part” mentioned that Goodson
had in the Carolina game was making ten —
of the 11 points the Wildcats scored in
the last half of the Tar Heel mixup. Five
perfect field goals by him kept the locals
in the lead all during the latter stages of
of the contest when the other guns of
Davidson were effectually silenced by the
Tar Heels.

Invitations have been sent out by the
Athletic department to 35 high schools
for the High School track meet to be
held here March 21st. Entries are ex-
pected to come from at least 20 teams in
the A. loving will again be
awarded to the winning team, and other
indivdual planned.
Charlotte has won the meet ever since its

state. cup

awards are being
beginning, but competiton has: been get-
ting and harder. the

Queen City boys have another good team

harder However,
this year, from all reports, and they will
likely enter as one of the favorites again.
The freshman basketball game here
tcmorrow night will be one of the best
games the yearlings will have this year.
The Charlotte team won a decision over
Coach Laird’s men when they met in
Charlotte some time ago. But on the first
year men’s home court it may be a dif-
ferent story. Charlotte is undefeated so
far by all competition, and have one of
the prettiest functioning teams in this
section. They will be worth watching.

Annual State Meet
Held Here March 21

The annual North Carolina high school
tournament will be held at Richardson Field
and is scheduled for March 21. This will
be the fifth annual track meet for all the
high schools in the state. Tex Tilson, track
coach of Davidson College, mailed out 36
invitations to as many high schools in North
Carolina inviting them to participate. Coach
