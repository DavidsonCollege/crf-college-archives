Harriers Meet Furman
After Excellent Start

By MARK CONNORS
Staff Writer

Coming off an excellent
opening run at Stone Mountain,
the Wildcat Harriers face a
very fine Furman squad today
at4p.m.

The Cats opened their 1973-74
season last Saturday with a five
mile road race at Stone
Mountain, Ga. Because of
the increased number of run-
gers on the team this year, head
coach Sterling Martin decided
to enter two teams.

One team was comprised of
freshmen and juniors with the
other team composed solely of
sophomores.

‘Everyone ran far above ex-
pectation,”’ according to Mar-
tin. ‘It was definitely a very
positive beginning for us.”

To the non-runner, the final
statistics wouldn't be that im-
pressive with Jesse Smith, the
number one finisher for David-
son, finishing 55th.

However, Martin said, ‘‘The
competition has always been
very keen at this particular
race, and having five runners
finish under 28 minutes for five
miles is the best finish we’ve
had in around eight years at this
stage of the season.

‘“‘We used to be pleased with
even one finish under 30
minutes.’’ Martin added.

Besides having the first five

“Eddie told me after the
game that he could've run it
back all the way if he had just
one more block, but I pointed
out that it took him about three
minutes to return it as far as he
did, and if he had scored i t
probably would have taken two
days,” Fagg quipped.

The offensive line turned in
its best performance of the year
as it consistently gave Harper
time to find his receivers. Har-
per completed 14 of 19 attempts
Saturday for 202 yards.

The running game improved
as Larry Hardaway filled in
for the injured Dave Ingold and
picked up 41 yards in 16 carries.

Cat Harriers finish under 28
minutes, the Cats had their first
10 runners finish under 29
minutes which also prompted
Martin to believe that this was
the best cross country in at least
eight years.

Individual performers
highlighted by Martin included
Jesse Smith, who finished first
for Davidson, Coty Pinckney,
John Barksdale, and Jeff
Neikirk.

Once again, team captain
Ricky Bell led the way for the
team only to be passed in the
final mile by Smith.

The Cats open their dual meet
season with Furman today.
‘Furman will be very strong
and almost out of our class, but
I'm hoping that maybe we can
surprise them,”’ Martin com-
mented. ‘‘You really can’t tell
on our course what the outcome
will be because of the way cer-
tain people run it.”’

Walker, a 5’ll’’, 170 pound
flanker proved to be a package
of excitement for football fans
last year. He is easily David-
son’s early season bright spot
after the first three games this

year.
With 62 receptions for 1031
yards and eight  touch-

downs, Walker finished the 1972
schedule ranked as the fifth
leading receiver in the nation.

After the last two games,
losses to Wofford and Rich-
mond, he had gained 268 yards
on 20 passes. —

Even with such impressive
statistics, Walker, an
honorable-mention all
American, will probably not
receive a lot of attention from
the pros.

‘I was really a risk to make it
in college ball,’’ the talented
senior said as he glanced
through a newspaper. ‘The lit-
tle guys that play pro-ball all
have just really exceptional
speed and moves or some
other outstanding ability.

“| hear that there were a few
scouts at the Richmond game,
but they could be there to watch
anybody,” Walker said.

“Sure if I were drafted I'd
love to give it a try just to see
what professional football is
like.

Walker put into words some
of his personal feelings with
regard to football at Davidson.

“I can't really say that I have
any personal goals. With all the
super receivers that have
played here, Davidson records
are pretty much out of reach.

“If something should come

fidence in the Cat’s ability to
win.

‘“‘We don’t have the big
players or very many scholar-
ships, but we do have a good
coach and a lot of guys who
want to win,” Walker praised.
“It’s just a question of when
we'll put our _ plusses
together .I’m hoping people will
stick with us until then.”

Walker is the type player
responsible for the trademark
of explosiveness that Davidson
offenses have come to know
over the past few years. He ex-
pects the Cats to explode.

He loves the game and enjoys
speaking of it.

“Anybody who wants to talk
about football,’’ the Palatka,
Fla. native commented, ‘‘stop
by sometime.”
