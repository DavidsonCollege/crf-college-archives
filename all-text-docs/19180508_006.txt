DAVIT,SON IS VICTOR IN
TWve THIRDS HER DEBATES

Davidson College has been in the field
of inter-collegiate debating for nine
years, so far as the records show, and
during this time her teams have made a
very creditable record. Of the eighteen
inter-collegiate contests held Davidson
has won twelve, while her opponents
were victorious in six.

Davidson's first debate with another |
college’Wwis held on Easter Monday,
1909, with Wake Forest. This was the!
first contest in a series of five, and altho’
Davidson lost this initial debate, she won‘
three out of the five, and became the|
owner of a handsome loving cup offered
by the Winston-Salem Board of Trade
and Howard E. Rondthaler, to the win-
ner of the series.

Another cup was won by the repre-
sentatives of the Red and Black, over
‘Wofford College. This cup was offered
by Messrs. G. E. Wilson, P. M. Brown,
R. A. Dunn and R. M. Miller, Jr., of
Charlotte, to the winner of two out of
three contests between these two insti-
tutions. Davidson won the first two de-
bates, and thus became the owner of the
cup in short order.

Only one series has been lost by Da-
vidson, that being with the University
of South Carolina, which won two out
of three.

Below is given a summary of all the
debates Davidson has held with other
colleges, the year in which held, with

COLLEGE PUBLICATIONS
COMPLETE SUCCESSFUL YEAR

As the college draws near the close of
the '17-'18 session and we begin to look
back over the past and review the things|
that have been accomplished during the
year there is nothing that is a source of
more gratification to us than our college
publications. It has of course, been a
time above all times when there would
have been some excuse for a disorganiza-
tion of such college activities, but instead
of that the editors of the various publi-
cations have gone ahead and given us
periodicals that are the equal of those
produced in any previous year, The
student body, too, has stood solidly be-
hind them, and has displayed an un-
usual interest in them.

QUIPS AND CRANKS.

The 1918 volume of “Quips and
Cranks” has been printed and is expected
in the next week or two. It.is about the
same size as former volumes as to the
number of pages, and is bound in black
leather with a stamped in gold design on
the hack. The paper"is white enamel.

THE DAVIDSONIAN,

Tue Davivsonian has seen one of
the most successful years of its infancy.
The thing was accomplished which many
thought impossible—that of getting out
six pages thruout the year. In years be-
fore six pages would come out intermit-
tently and would have to‘return, on ac-
count of finances, to the original four-
page sheet. Not only was the size in-
creased, but also the paper was sent into
paths not yet reached by the college
weekly.

The policy of the publication was to
serve as a missionary for the college, and
this function was well carried out. The
board realized that whenever a paper
was put in the hands of an alumnus who
had Idést touch with the college that he
would revive his interest, if he was much

of an alumnus. Also, THE Davipson-
JAN in an atractive way heralded the
great achievements of the college. High
ideals were held up before the student
body and agitated. It reflected the best
of college life and strove to aid the col-
lege in every way, and at the same time
to give ttems of interest to the alumni
and make friends better friends.
DAVIDSON COLLEGE MAGAZINE.
While not characterized by any work
of extraordinary ability, the Magazine
this year has kept up to the standard in
its past contributions. This fact is evi-
denced by the remarks of its contempo-
raries over the South who, as a whole,
give Davidson the credit for turning out
a capable magazine. Especially favor-
able have been the remarks about the
way in which the Staff has met the prob-
lem of reduced funds. Altho confronted
with a somewhat depleted treasury due

eS

Booe’s Market

to the war, the Magazine has succeeded
in reducing the cost of publication, and
at the same time maintained the quality
of its contributions. Were it not for
the cover, which draws a good deal of
unfavorable comment from the students,
the Magazine would present an agree-
able appearance to anyone.

The man to whom the credit belongs
for the business ability with which the
Magazine has been managed this year is
J. A. Thames. Without his work, the
Magazine would probably have had a
rough and stormy course.

The Magazine has contained varied
literary attempts this year. They range
all the way from a discussion of the
Modern Drama to the Drama of the
Ages. There has been the philosopher
with the “Vindication of Selfishness,”
and the psychopathical writer with his
story of the man with the dog’s brain.

The fiction of the Magazine, while
not startling in its uniqueness, has been
well planned and well written. Among
the poetry has appeared “The Guest
Without His Wedding Garment,” and
we have had a sample of free verse writ-
ing. The best contributions of the year
have been the dialect poems of Q. N.
Huneycutt.

L. M. Thomas, the editor, has given
Davidson a good Magazine for 1918,
and to him the college should be grateful.
