Committee strongly urged that
some kind of cost accounting be
initiated and closely tied in with
long-range planning:

Williams emphasized the im-
portance of economic con-
siderations. He said that these
considerations have a vital af-
fect on such things as ex-
panding programs, the size of
enrollments, adequacy of
physical facilities, personnel,
and the character of the com-
munity.

The Committee specifically
highlighted the need for more
endowments for faculty
salaries and for faculty and

Williams believes that the
Committee confirmed the
prominent needs that have been
expressed by the community
and campus. He added that it is
vitally important for the College

to have determined what its |
primary objectives are in order'

to secure donors.

We (the Committee) created
an environment on campus
which will be conducive to total
institutional long-range plan-
ning. At the heart of that kind of
planning are program needs,”
he concluded.

Willams said, ‘It is equaly

The Committee said that the
need for funds to improve
student housing and food ser-
vices was pressing. They hinted
that the existing system of
small eating clubs may have to
give way to a central eating
facility.

Because student life depends
to a degree on the “focus which
