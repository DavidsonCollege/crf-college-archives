Keen Ackn
“Tendernes

The rise of a new Stoicism in
modern society embodies the
spirit of the ‘‘Tenderness Ta-
boo,” according to Tuesday's
chapel speaker Dr. Samuel M.
Keen of Louisville Presbyterian
Seminary.

The tenderness taboo is ‘‘an
exaltation of self-sufficiency and
a repression of hope.”'

A vociferous anti-puritanical
view of sex, however, is not ac-
companied by a comparable log-
ic intellectually.

According to Dr. Keen, the

his fellowman, to be away, or

feeling rationalism. Therefore. |

Madison Avenue projections of
the ideal man incorporate this
solitude in their prototype of the

original jurisdiction on cases in
which both faculty and student
body have similar disciplinary
rules. The Honor Court, of
course, handles all honor viola-
tions, but it appears that the
Student Body Regulations Court
has little business. This court
has tried only two cases since
its formation last school year.
The court's chairman, Paul Mar-
fon, personally makes the deci-
sion on whether or not the case
will be accepted, and he has
chosen to accept only one case
which the Dean of Students re-
ferred to the court.

Dean Burts said this week,
“We'd like to have the students
take as much responsibility as
they will accept.'' But he indi-
cated that he was somewhat dis-
appointed in the way the Stu-
dent Body Regulations Court has
operated.

The proposed draft would con-
tinue the faculty's appellate jur-
isdiction over the Honor Court
and the Student Body Regula-
tions Court. However, according |
to present practice, the student
courts’ decisions are notcchang-
ed.

At present there appears to
be little emphasis by the col-

lege on the need for clinical

counseling for those guilty of
disciplinary infractions. Dr. W.
G. Workman, professor. of psy-
chology, sées the need for two
half-time clinical psychologis:s
to counsel students.

These men would carry one-
half the normal teaching load.
Workman feels that their status
as teachers would increase their
acceptance by students and fac-
ulty. Presently Workman car-
ries a full load of work in addi-
tion to giving clinical counsel to
a limited number of students.
He reports that he is forced to
turn away numerous students.
