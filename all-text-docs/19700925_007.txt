BEST POTENTIAL EVER

Recruits Bring Coach Joy

By DAVE TIERNEY
Sports Writer

With the start of practice
less than a month away
(Oct. 15), Davidson’s basket-
ball power certainly won't
be deficient. Coaches Terry
Holland, Bo Brickles; and
Neill, McGeachy have done
a job par-excellence by nab-
bing several outstanding
freshmen. °

Five four-year  scholar-

FALCON!

cipients -were rewarded to
John Falconi, Steve Gadaire,

Paul Wagner, T. J. Pecorak, _

and Mike Sorrentino.

Head Freshman Coach
McGeachy confidently ad-
mitted..that ‘‘pure ability-
wise, thi§ team has the best
potential ever.’: He also
foresees adequate depth and
fine balance. With this he
believes he has assembled
a challenging schedule, in-
cluding South Carolina,
Duke, Wake Forest, Clem-
son,. VIM.I., and Furman.

Coach McGeachy was
quick to point out, however,
that these boys have yet to
practice oF, play together.
“There is a great difference
between having the poten-
tial and developing and de-
livering it,’ he stated. ‘‘A)-
so, we the coaches have /@
natural responsibility in our
field to help these boys,"’ he
commented.

As he lounged comfort-
ably in his chair, McGeachy
calmly announced that lack
of height will be the primary

problem. Paul Wagner, at
6°6"', is the tallest of the five
scholarship players.

The coach expects to em-
ploy a tenacious defense
along with a colorful run-
ning offense to compensate
for this lack of height. ‘Ail
of these boys can = run
and maneuver exceedingly
‘vell,”” McGeachy comment
ed,

Martin Remains Cautious

In Viewing C-C Prospects

By CHARLIE TERRELL
Sports Writer

“Over the river and
through the woods” may be
familar lyrics to a children’s
Christmas carol, but to the
members of Davidson's Cross
Country team they take on
an added significance as the
harriers race against the
clock and across the country-
side,

Coach Sterling Martin, who
is beginning his first year as
head coach, is approaching
the coming season with caut-
ious optimism. He cited three
main reasons for his appre-
hension.

“We are faced with the
old nemesis of competing
against schools who give
scholarships and who have
many strong runners, and
this is a very difficult sched-
ule for us also,” said Mar-
tin.

Regarding the schedule, he
rated St. Andrews, VMI.
Washington and Lee, The
Citadel and Campbell as
teams which the Wildcats
have a good chance of beat-
ing.

The tougher opponents are
Wake Forest, Western Caro-
lina, High Point and William
and Mary. Martin chose the
latter team to win the con-
ference championship, not-
ing that “they have a strong
program, far superior to the
other schools in the confer-
enc.e.” The tndians also
claim the best known in-
dividual performer in Howell
Michael, who won the NCAA
mite last year.

The third obstacle which
the team must overcome is
the loss of John Puckett,
James Puckett and Stagg

&

, top five performers. Seniors

Newman through graduation.
“We will be thin In upper-
classman,” said Martin.

Concerning the members
of the team, Martin express-
ed pleasure with the great
number of freshmen out for
this year's team, noting that .
“this is the most we’ve ever—
had to try out and we should
have plenty of depth.”

This year’s captain is Ran
Coble, a senior from Graham
who.is following in the tradi-
tion of recent illustrious cap-
tains. Randy Phillips and
Stagg Newman are former
leaders who were very ac-
tive in campus affairs and
Coble is no exception, serv
nig as SGA President. Coach
Martin described Coble as
a ‘good leader who helps
hold the team together. His
experience is a big asset.”

Analyzing ‘the other run-
ners, Martin called junior
Howard Boyd ‘‘the best bet
to be our number one man:
he is also a good leader and
is in excellent condition.”

Also counted on heavily are
experienced sophomores Joe
Shiitbley, Richard Fort, and
Ron Clark to be among his

Jim Upchurch and Rob Hoy
“could help give us added
leadership,” said = Martin.
Bill Naylor, a junior, could
break into the top five if
he stays healthy. |

Sixteen freshmen are Sut
for the team and Martin
singled out John McElveen,
Steve Bonville, Dave Dug-
‘ gins, Pete Kyle, Jim Lehn- |
berg and Sam McAliley as
youngsters that “these boys
will be hindered by a lack
of experience and most of
them are making the big
jump trom. two. to.five miles.”
ee

of the harriers.

Conmenting on his goals in
his first year as head coach,
Martin remarked that it is
taking . him longer to work
with sé many individuals,
and he relies on Coble for

help. “When I run with them,

l try fo observe their tech-
nique and instiit some spirit,”
stated Martin. He tries to
teach’ them the proper stride
and ‘make sure they are run-
ning. in a relaxed manner.
Martin stresses a
quantity of running at first
so the runners will be able
to perform beyond their
limit. “Once the fundamen-
tals are learned, then we
work on pacing and strat-
egy,” he added.

The cross country program
is not subsidized, and it op-
erates on a_ low-pressure
level. “It gives an individual
a chance to make a varsity
team and provides the op-
portunity for a physical out-
let at Davidson,” he cited.

Finally, Martin commend-
ed the fine job that senior
Peter Lutken, has done as
the team manager. In addi-
tion. Martin stated,

courses in the .conference,
with its variety and pretty
surroundings and I would
like to urge students to keep
their motorcycles, off- the
course. These vehicles are
not to be ridden on any of
our athletic fields.”

It seems that the harriers
can have a break-even sea-
son, and if a fast front run-
ner emerges they may sur--
prise some teams. Straying
cyclists may find themselves
being pursued by runners in

‘an effort to clear the course:

Coach McGeachy empha-
sized that Davidson is more
limited in recru‘ting than
most other schools. In fact
he estimated that ‘‘only one-
third of the potential scho-
jarship players can be re.
cruited by Davidson due to
acedemic requirements. We
required at ieast a 1000 on
the College Board tests be-
fore we will recruit a boy,”
he stated.

Of course the image
projected by Davidson Col-
lege, both academically and
basketball-wise, has advanc-
ed greatly since 1960. Coach
McGeachy believes this: has
brought much success, any-”
time and anywhere a David-
son coach recruits.

Verifying this statement
are the players themselves,
When asked why they chose
Davidson College they _stat-_
ed almost unanimously t

atmosphere along with a top-
notch basketball team:

prehensive Tuesday when

The prize wirtning selection
was described by Mrs. Gar-

buttered cream icing.” The
icing was decorated by a
wildeat head and the words
“Davidson.”

Paul Wagner won ab-
metropolitan. awards in

plaved varsity ball for four
years. The fact that ‘David

tol to compete for one of the
80 cakes at the end of a 1.7
mile race. The 36fh annual
Freshman Cake Race was
a smashing success, organiz-
ed by Coach Whittle.

The race commenced at
the city limits, down unto
Concord, through Jackson
Court and into the football
stadium. First-place George
Edwards said, ‘'the highway
was the most difficult be-
cause it was a_ continuous

incline.”
