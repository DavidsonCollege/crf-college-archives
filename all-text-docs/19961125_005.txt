bate purpose of inspections

Angered apartment owners claim that routine inspections “treat them like children”

Fall inspections of the Martin
Court senior apartments, which
were recently conducted by
Davidson College’s Residence Life
Office, left several disgrunteld
apartment residents in their wake.

Building Services staff mem-
bers use acomprehensive 23-point
checklist in their inspections, a
completed copy of which is pre-

sented to the apartment occupants
after the inspection’s completion.
Facilities and Housing Coor-
dinator Debbie Young says of the
inspection process, “The building
inspectors are, if anything, too le-
nient in their evaluations.”
According to Young, thenum-
ber of persons with inspection
policy grievances constitutes a very
tiny minority, since only two of the
82 senior apartments failed to meet
inspection standards this fall.

Some apartment residents
have seen fit to add a series of
amendments to what they consider
an otherwise too restrictive lease
contract.

However, Young says that
while resident input is always en-
couraged, no serious consideration
is given to terms appended to the
lease agreement of residents’ own
volition.

Senior Ben DeLisa says he
was in astate of utter disbelief after

his apartment was assessed a $40
fine for dirty dishes in the kitchen
sink. :

Says DeLisa, “It’s absolutely
ludicrous. Who are they to come
in here and tell us to wash our
dishes?...We’re college seniors,
and they’re treating us like chil-
dren.”

Standard college policy
printed in the Davidson College
red student handbook, and reiter-
ated in the Martin Court lease

agreement, states the following:
“All Martin Court apartment suites
will be inspected twice annually.
Apartment residents are respon-
sible for clean common areas and
clean appliances.

“Residents with areas that do
not pass inspection will be given
48 hours in which to rectify the
situation. Failure to meet subse-
quent inspections will result in $40
fines ($10 per apartment occu-
pant).”
