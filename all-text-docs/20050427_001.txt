Commons, F among
summer renovations

By EmILy Kota
Senior Staff Writer

Students can look forward to a
spruced up campus when they
return next fall. This summer’s
major renovation projects include
Richardson Stadium, Vail
Commons, and Martin Court F.

Richardson Stadium construc-
tion has already begun and is
scheduled to be completed before
the fall semester begins.

The bleachers are being extend-
ed so that the middle of the bleach-
ers is at the 50 yard line.
Underneath the newly constructed
bleacher addition, students will
find a new weight training facility
and space for visiting teams.

Soccer player Heidi Wilbrandt
’07 said “the addition to the stadi-

By next year, Vail Commons will have changed its serving system

um will be extremely beneficial to
all sports teams, because it gives us

an actual weight room, as opposed _

to the racquetball courts we use
now. Hopefully with the new addi-
tions, we will be able to house
more fans for all athletic events.”

The renovation of Vail
Commons is slated to begin at the
start of graduation weekend. Plant
Facilities Director David
Holthouser said, “While you’re
lined up for graduation, we’ ll be in
there moving them out.”

Holthouser described the project
as an “88 day wonder.”

The principle change for Vail
Commons involves the delivery
process for food. The facility is
shifting from a cafeteria line with
separate servers and cooks to a

$22M necessary for
full ADA compliance

By LESLIE HEMPSON
Senior Staff Writer

An independent consulting firm
determined that the college would
have to make $22 million worth of
repairs to fully comply with
“accessibility building code”
guidelines in the Americans with
Disabilities Act and state and local
law.

During the 2004 audit, represen-
tatives of A/C/E — Support
Engineering in Raleigh examined
every “space” on campus to deter-
mine whether it was physically
accessible to all individuals,
including the disabled.

After eight months of inspection,
the firm provided Davidson with
16 notebooks worth of recommen-
dations.

According to Director of
Physical Plant David Holthouser
and Associate Dean of Student Life
Kathy Bray-Merrell, the audit was
done at the school’s “initiative.”

The college is now sorting
through the recommendations so
that it can begin to establish priori-
ties for future projects.

The recent Chambers renova-
tions, which cost $20 million,
included the installation of addi-
tional elevators and ramps and
increasing doorway width.

Athena Stevens ’06, co-founder
of C.R.LP., a student organization
that was started in January to pro-
vide a louder voice for students
with disabilities, said this was not
enough.

She said, “With $22 million

Email surveys
may reduce
effectiveness

BY BEN WHIGHAM
Senior Staff Writer

Mass-email surveys have
grown increasingly common.
The surveys come from multiple
sources including sociology the-
ses, student government, class
projects, and Auxiliary Service
questionnaires. The large num-
ber of surveys has annoyed
some students and possibly
reduced responsiveness, and
thus effectiveness.

“Three years ago nobody
mentioned email surveys as a
problem,” said — Associate
Professor of Political Science
Pat Sellers. “Now I increasingly
hear complaints from students
about all the surveys in their
inboxes.”

“It’s a real resource, but it can
be overused,” he added.

As part of his “Public
Opinion” course, Sellers and his
students conduct an annual
political survey. The percentage
of the student body to respond
to the survey peaked at 59 per-
cent in 2003 but dropped to 51
percent in 2004.

Sellers said he believes the
numbers are too speculative to
represent a-definite trend, yet he
does caution that a low response
rate produces inaccurate results.

“There is lots of evidence that
declining response rates pro-
duce biased results,” said
Sellers. “The people who
answer the survey become less
representative of the overall
