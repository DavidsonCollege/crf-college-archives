Broaden evaluation input

Davidson students have short at-
tention spans when it comes to
campus issues. Policies or events
that we find disagreeable dominate
campus conversations for a few days
until the novelty’ wears off and then
quickly fade away. Given this pattern
of “instant evaporation” of student
concern, the continued existence of
anger and discussion about the
decision to not renew Dr. Devon's
contract is an unusaual and pleasant
phenomenon.

The problems with the present
system (or non-system) of faculty
evaluation have all been diligently
documented in recent issues of The

\Davidsonian and just as diligently
denied or “clarified” by the admini-
stration. The allegations have inclua-
ed such items as faculty members
being called for meetings at which,
unknown to them, they were to be
evaluated, the solicitation of student
opinion on certain professors in
informal conversations and the use of
vague reasons like “social maladjust-
ment” as reasons for choosing not to
rehire faculty members. These allega-
tions point to two main problems
concerning the faculty evaluation
process at Davidson College.

The first problem has to do with
where the final evaluation decisions
are made. It is now painfully apparent
that too much power lies in the hands
of President Spencer and Dr. Zimmer-
mann. In addition to determining
which faculty members and students
aré included in the evaluation of a
given professor, they also, in the end,
make the final decision about which
untenured professors are asked to
Stay. So, not only do President
Spencer and Dr. Zimmermann get to
create an evaluation process for each
faculty member, they also get to
decide what the outcome. of that
process will be. Faculty renewal
decisions afe of such tremendous
importance in a small academic
community such as Davidson that no
two men, regardless of their position,
should be allowed to make those
decisions.

The solution to this dangerous
concentration of power is the forma-
tion of a faculty evaluation committee
made up of several faculty members,
several students ana a tew “outsid-
ers” with no direct ties to Davidson.
The outsiders could either bé from
the Board of Visitors or, better yet,
faculty members of merit from other
institutions. This committee would
be responsibie for obtaining and
assessing input on faculty members
who are up for renewal, and then
making the final decision.

Charlotte, but such an evaluation
committee would fill a glaring void
and be a tremendous improvement
over the current two-man process.
Rumor has it that President Spencer
and Dr. Zimmermann are now draft-
ing a definitive faculty evaluation
procedure. Let us hope that it will
inclued a permanent evaluation com-
mittee.

In order for such a committee to
reach fruition, however, the faculty
will have to stop merely grumbling
about their grievances and take the
time to express their discontent with
the present system to Dr. Zimmer-
mann and President Spencer. It is in
the faculty’s own interest to do so.

The second problem has to do with
the criteria of evaluation. Much
criticism has been directed toward
the current evaluation criteria, yet
little attention has been given to the
crucial task of developing superior
criteria. Before this can be done,
however, the weakness of the present
system must be pinpointed.

As it stands now, faculty members
up for renewal are assessed in the
three areas of teaching ability, aca-
demic prowess, and involvement in
the community. The tremendous
advantage of this system is its
flexibility. A professor who is weak in
one of these three areas may be able
to compensate for it with exceptional
strength in the other two areas i.e.
the excellent lecturer who is active in
the community might be rehired even
if he/she detests research and writ-
ing.

The weakness of this three part
system is its vagueness of definition.
Teaching ability and academic prow-
ess are obviously difficult to ascer-
tain; even more nebulous is “involve-
ment in the community.” More clearly
delineated definitions of these three
areas are desperately needed.

The greatest potential evil of all,
however, would be to make the
definitions of the three areas too
specific. Strictly defined criteria,
such as those found at many large
universities, would result in a stifling
atmosphere of rigidity and didactic-
ism, with no allowance for individual
differences and preferences. Such

an atmosphere, with its publishing
requirements and inter-faculty com-
petition, would be more damaging to
Davidson than the present policy.
The solution, then, is to find a
workable common ground between
Our present vague and subjective
evaluation process and the rigid
university evaluation system that lies
at the other end of the spectrum.
Obviously, this is a difficult and
painstaking task, vet it, MYSt-siart

Opinion

West Bank vote?

By DEAN EKLUND
Guest Columnist __
One of the more positive

outgrowths of President Sa-

dat’s new dynamic Middle

East policy manifests itself in

focusing world attention on

the Middle East problem.

Attention is now centered on

the breakdown of the initial

phase of talks between Israel
and Egypt and their future
prospects. Arabic countries
are exclaiming that Sadat
gambled and lost.
Momentarily at least, it
appears they are right. Sadat
gambled that his initiatives,
by illustrating the possibilities
peace would bring to both

Israel and Egypt, would sof-

ten Israel’s position on accep-

table borders and a Palestin-
ian state. Sadat managed to
create an atmosphere of opti-
mism in Egypt, Israel, and
through much of the world for
the prospects of peace, while
proving that Jew and Arab
could live together peacefully.

Israel did not respond with
any significant concessions,
4Sowever. Total withdrawal to

»re-1967 boundaries or an

independent Palestinian state

remained unacceptable to Is-
rael. Sadat meanwhile found
himself in a very weak bar-

* gaining position. The refusal

of other involved Arab coun-

™ tries to participate in Sadat’s

designated peace process, in-

cluding talks with Israel,

prevented Sadat from com-
promising in his demands for a
comprehensive settlement for
fear of being accused of selling
out the Arab cause. This is in
spite of the fact that most of
the Sinai, including that part
which Israel desires to retain,
_and the fate of the Palestinian
people are of marginal interest
to Egypt. The latter claim is
evidenced by the conditions
under which the Palestinians
lived in the Gaza strip when it
was under Egyptian control.

Perhaps I have understated
Egyptian interests, but the
significant point about the
breakdown in talks is the
Egypt can negotiate for E-
gypt, but she cannot negotiate
for the Palestinians or for
Syria or for any other Arab
party. Egypt is in no position
to compromise other nations’
interests.

Egypt and Israel must a-
gree to a formula which would
bring Palestinian representa-
tion to any future talks. One
solution would be to conduct
elections in the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip to elect
representatives to these talks.
This may not be a smooth
process due to the scant
political development in these
areas. However, Israel has
effectively held elections in the
West Bank, thus demonstra-
ting the feasibility of such
elections. Egypt and the U.S.
could play a constructive role
in conducting the elections.
This method would also have
the advantage of not directly .
excluding the PLO.

Hopefully, through direct
negotiations with Palestini-
ans, Israel would recognize
that a newly formed Palestin-
ian state would have no inten-
tion of conducting a type of
guerrila warfare on the Israeli
border. Instead of a military
confrfontation with Israel, a
Palestinian state would seek
from Israel social and econom-
ic aid and exchange. Perhaps
also Mr. Begin would realized
that it was not borders but
relations between Israeli and
Arab that caused the ’67 war,
and that only through im-
proved relations between Is-
raeli and Arab—not through
more defensible borders—can
Israel be assured of a lasting
peace.
