Foreman Speaker
At Senior Smoker
On. Friday Night

Retreshihentss Serven and One-
Act Play Presented by
Dramatic Club

To the accompaniment of yells for the
class of ‘29 the Seniors had a smoker
at the Maxwell Chambers Hotel on last
Friday night. Besides a majority of the
members of the Senior class there were
three visitors present; M. C. O'Neal,
Prof. K. J. Foreman, and W. E. Milton.
Camper O'Neal gave the invocation and
the Class sang “College Ties.”

For refreshments, sandwiches, cakes,
and punch were served and cigars were
passed around. A number of songs were
sung by the entire class and P. B. Frye
gave some special selections at the piano

« W. C. Archie completed the musical part
of the program with a solo. 3

.R. Z. Johnson, J. D. McCall, and J. S.
Meacham, members of the Dramatic Club,
presented a one-act comedy skit which
was very amusing.

Professor Foreman, the speaker of the
evening, was then introduced. He took
for the subject of his talk the familiar
Mother Goose rhyme:

“Peter, Peter, pumpkin eater,

. Had a wife and couldn't keep her,

Put her in a pumpkin shell, |

Professor Foreman explained the theme
of the rhyme and its different applica-
tions. He gave a very interesting and
amusing talk on this unique subject.

With the singing of, “O, Davidson,”
and “College Ties” the smoker ended.
One more informal gathering is planned
for sometime before commencement.

| McGavock Selected
As Senior Officers

W. G. McGavock was elected Secretary
and Treasurer of next year's class on
the first ballot last Friday morning. The
candidates nominated were W. G. Mc-
Gavock, D. E. Yow, R. W. McDermid,
J. W. Moore, and S. R. Coker.

McGavock is a very active and popu-
lar man on the campus. He is a member
of the Kappa Alpha social fraternity, and
is-a very active member <on ‘the annual
staff. McGavock is also member of
the Davidson track team.

This completes the election for next
year’s Senior class. The following men
have been elected as the officers for the
Senior class next year. W. B. McGuire,
President; A. H. Whittle, Vice-Presi-,
dent; and W. G. McGavock, Secretary
and Treasurer. The other officers were
elected at earlier dates, the election for
Secretary and Treasurer having been
postponed until last Friday.

394 Students Have
Now Re-Registered

a

Up to the present time, only 394 men
have re-registered for next year’s courses.
According to Mr. F. W. Hengeveld, a
total of about 430 of the old men are ex-
pected to sign up. As yet, there are still
fifty-one undergraduates who have failed
to re-register. Some of these are away
on the baseball team while there are
others who will not return to school this
fall. A few more are coming in daily
and arranging their courses for the next
term.

Already there has been 120 new men
whose applications as members of the
Freshman class have been accepted. If
the expected number of old men sign
up, only about a hundred more new men
will be admitted or approximately 225
in all. This will make a total of around
650 men at Davidson next fall,

’Twas always thus: “The children
now love luxury, they have bad man-
ners, contempt for Sauthority, they
show disrespect for elders, and love
chatter in place of exercise. Children
are now tyrants, not the servants of
their households. They no longer rise
when elders enter the room, They.con-
tradict their parents, chatter before
company, gobble up dainties at the
table, cross their legs, and tyrannize
over their teachers.”—Socrates.

Youth ends when the sons of class-
mates start coming to college. One
means to be bright and cordial, but re-
ceiving these young gentlemen is quite
as depressing as finding tucked away
in the attic an old belt in days gone
by used to go all the way ‘round, —
Wesleyan University Alumnus.

The benefit of a college education
comes to light through the Chicagoan
who executed a football tackle on a
hold-up man and turned him over to
the police.—Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

The latest educational venture in
Southern California is a “commuters’
school.” Several educational institu-
tions in that region have combined to
offer courses to suburbanites for study
while traveling to and from their work.
The next logical step in this direction
is the institution of college professors
as conductors on these trains. — The
Daily Maroon, Chicago.

The human brain is a wonderful or-

gan. It starts working the moment
we get up in the morning and doesn’t
stop until we get to class. — Anony-
mous,

Among all the accomplishments of
youth there is none preferable to a de-
cent and agreeable behavior among
men, a modest freedom of speech, a
soft and elegant manner of address, a
graceful and lovely deportaynent, a
cheerful gravity and good nifeor, with
a mind appearing ever serene under
the ruffling accidents of human life—
