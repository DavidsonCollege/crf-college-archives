Davidson Professors Highlight
Coming November Gallery Crawl

By Will Montgomery

Two distinguished artists and
Davidson Art professors, Herb
Jackson and Russ Warren, are
featured artists in the upcoming
Gallery Craw] this Friday, Novem-
ber 1.

For the unfamiliar, Gallery
Crawl occurs every first Friday of
the month through spring. Galler-
ies in and around Spirit Square in
Charlotte open their doors from

/six to eight p.m. to introduce the
upcoming month’sexhibits. Typi-

cally, the evening is festive with |

crowds of visitors conversing and
sampling wine and hors d’ oeuvres
as they migrate through exhibits.

Russ Warren’s show opens at
the Hodges TaylorGallery and runs
through November 27. Warren is
ahighly acclaimed artist originally
from Houston, Texas whose work
was selcted for the 1984 Venice
Biennialle and was shown last year
in the North Carolina Trienneum,
among others.

Dot Hodges, of Hodges Taylor
Gallery, says that his work shows
influences of Central American
folk art, perhaps as a result of his
Texanroots. Warren often distorts
images of horses and bulls, and
draws upon images from
Hispanoamerica. Hodges men-
tions that his work demonstrates a
balance between bestiality and
humor. Part of the success of his
imagery resides in his use of color,

‘Hodges asserting that “his palette

is very exciting.”

Warren himself explains that
an important partof his work comes
through “playing with opposites.”
Light and dark, cold and hot col-
ors, or soft and harsh imagery set
up contrasts and conflicts that
energize the works. Hecomments
that his work training horses influ-
ences his recent work.

When asked if there were spe-
cial ideas to keep. in mind when
viewing his work, Warren said that
he thinks great art is universally

accessible and he doesn’t believe .

that a painting works if you have to
have first read a book to under-
stand it.
Herb Jackson is one of the
premiere artists in North Carolina
and the Southeastern United States.
His show is currently exhibited at
the Jerald Melberg Gallery and
will run until November 16.
Jackson describes his work as
the record of an inward journey.
Each painting contains over a

hundred layers of paint, molded .

and scraped on top of the other. He
uses acrylic paint mixed with
ground pumice to construct these
layers.

The use of the pumice creates

- a gritty, powdery texture and as .

layers build upon layers, the paint-
ing takes on elements of sculpture.
Jackson’s technique has been de-.
scribed as a type of excavation,

where like the archaeologist, the
artist moves in to uncover hidden
information.

Jerald Melberg comments that
the recent group of paintings being
shown at Melberg Gallery have
become more sculptured with the
introduction of mica flakes. The
mica flakes are larger, heavier,
more geometrical, and in some
cases the iridescence of the rock
comes through the paint.

Melberg mentioned that some
visitors to the show have com-
mented upon the intensity of color.
Melberg somewhat agrees, but
directs attention to the “quietness”

of several paintings. These pieces‘

are contemplative, with a serene
and meditative quality. Plenty of
room has been given between the
paintings to emphasize the spiri-
tual resonance of the viewing
experience.

This Friday’s Gallery Crawl is
an opportunity to see outstanding
art and get into Charlotte for a
change. Dinner in Charlotte be-
fore or after the Crawl always
makes for an pleasant evening,
especially this Friday since it is
Parents Weekend.

The Melberg Gallery is located
on 119E. Seventh Streetacross the
street from Spirit Square. The
Hodges Taylor Gallery is located
on 227 N. Tryon Street and is one
and a half blocks north of Spirit
Square.

Matt Bumstead: Whistlin’ Dixie

When Reis McEntire belted
out herlatestsingle from the stage
of the Opry House a few weeks
ago, millions watched; many of
them cried.

As Garth Brooks wailed and
howled through “Shameless”,
“The Thunder Rolls”, and
“Friends in Low Places” in Win-
ston-Salem on October 19, the
crowd exploded. But they did so

| with uncommon zeal, with sheer

to that which you see in films of
‘The Beatles or Elvis in concert.

What is it, then, about coun-
try music that is so wrenching,
that drives fans to make pilgrim-
ages of thousands of miles just to
catch a glimpse of their favorite
artists, that drives me to write this
column every week?

well the artistcan bets to life the
song that he or she is performing.

It is here that country music, for
any thinking, feeling human
being, triumphs completely.
Songs are most often about love,
winning it and losing it. Some-.
times that love is for a family
member; sometimes it is just for
life itself.

Country can make you cry.
With powerful lyrics and stirring

‘vocals and instrumentals, these

songs have the power to convey
raw emotion to the listener to
such a degree that the listener is
