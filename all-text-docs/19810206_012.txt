Ken Wooden to speak on children’s plight

“This is a book that stems
obviously from a deep inner
compulsion, for Kenneth Wood-
en was a problem child, intract-
able, labelled retarded, saved
from the human scrap heap by
the remarkable woman who
became his wife. Redeemed, he
went to college, became a high
school teacher; from personal
experience he knows what can
be done to salvage wasted lives.
If this book disgusts and angers
enough to inspire reform, he will
have performed a valuable pub-

Black history month

lic service."’ This was the New
York Times Book Review's
assessment of Kenneth Wood-
en's book Weeping in the Play-
time of Others, published in
1976.

Wooden will speak in the 900
Room Thursday, February 5 at
8 p.m. about his investigations
of the plight of America’s
institutionalized children.

Weeping in the Playtime
resulted from Wooden’s study
of the reading levels of juveniles
in the New Jersey prison sys-

public discussion entitled ‘‘Dav-
idson: Black Perspectives.’’ The
discussion will be at 10 a.m.
in the Morrison Room.

Also scheduled are an Afro- ©

tem. His research for the book
took him to thirty states over a
period of three years.

Wooden revealed some start-
ling facts about institutionaliz-
ed children in an interview with
People magazine. Of the two
million juveniles in the child
welfare system, only about
200,000 have actually commit-
ted crimes; another 500,000 are
neglected children whose par-
ents could not or would not
support them.

Wooden recently published a
second book, The Children of
Jonestown. Some 300 children

- died in Guyana. Wooden con-

siders the very young to have
been murdered. ‘‘They didn’t
take that poison voluntarily,”
he said.

Karl Menninger called the
new book ‘“‘so fine, so honest; so
searching, and so moving. It is
a hard dose of medicine to take,
but it is medicine all Americans
ought to have to take.”

Wooden has appeared on
CBS's ‘‘60 Minutes’’. He is
currently the director of the
National Coalition for Child-
ren’s Justice.
