Five Years Ago, February 11, 1926

Davidson defeated Guilford by a score of
34 to 23. Starting with a fast attack in the
first period, the Wildcats played a snappy
and entertaining game of basketball to over-
whelm completely the quintet from Guilford.
Captain Laird and Anderson were the out-
standing stars, with Anderson the high point
man.

Ten Years Ago, February 11, 1926

As things look now in the race for state
championship, Trinity seems to have a slight
edge in some respects. Yet either the Uni-
versity of North Carolina or Davidson may
be counted in the running. Trinity is the
only quintet at present to get by undefeated
in the race for top honors.

(Continued from page 1)

Moses controlled himself he might have re-
mained in Egypt to sit on the throne and
rule the land. He said that in the desert
Moses must have often thought of the mis-
takes he had made which were responsible
for his being a wanderer in Midian. He em-
phasized the importance of young people to-
day living in such a way that in later years
look back over the events in
their lives there would be nothing to be
ashamed of, but only beautiful things to re-
member. Then
was anything in the past that was trot whole-
some, to forget it, and reach out to the fu-
ture, and press forward.

The speaker declared that the isolation
of Moses in the wilderness was a blessing,
since Moses spent his time in personal com-

mind, enkindled spiritual nature, and
created holiness in him. He asserted that
when adversity forces people to come closer
to God it is a glorious failure.

Dr. Frazer said that a -new prospective
was added to these other acquired things
and opened a new horizon to the great He-
brew leader which stretched far beyond the
desert. He expressed the delightfulness of
being led from darkness into light where
the plans and purposes of life are nobler.
In conclusion, Dr. Frazer told how Moses

N. C. State, Presbyterian College,
Citadel, and Gastonia

the season last week with correspondence
matches with Alabama, Polytech, Michigan

lege, Citadel and Gastonia. The team: has
just completed shooting off the prone posi-
tion in the Corps Area matches. It is planned
to shoot one position a week, until the match
is completed.

The boys are very much interested, and
Captain Blanton is looking forward to a suc-
cessful season. There are twenty boys om the
team, from which fifteen are picked to shoot
in each meet.

they are aggressive and persistent; they will
bear watching.”

“The South should remain,” said Dr. Wer-
tenbaker in conclusion, “as it has in the past,
a solid block of opposition to paternalism
and bureaucracy. Let us cling to those rights
reserved to the states by the Constitution
which have not already been taken over by
the Federal government under the all-em-
bracing ‘necessary and proper’ clause. Let us
retain our our individuality,
and our localism.”
