The Eumeneans decided that cabinet
members ought not to have seats in Con-
gress. The affirtnative argued that it
would save time, give accurate informa-
tion, and strengthen the administration,
but the negetive showed that it would
overwork the cabinet members and
make the administration too strong.

Several new books have been placed:

Rest thee in peace, my gallant lad,
Though far from home you sleep;

Will vigil o’er thee keep,

France, too, will consecrate the ground.
Her changeless stars above

And, in the air, to wrap thee ‘round,
Her lilies and her love.

The above poem was written by Dr.

his new book, “Memorials of Dixie-
land,” which is just off the press.

Mr. Montgomery, in whose memory
it was written, is one of Davidson's
alumni who made the supreme sacrifice.
He was a member of the class of 1909.

BERNARD McCUTCHEON SUF-

FERS BROKEN COLLAR
BONE.

The students on the Hill were sorry
to hear of the accident to Bernard Mc-
Cutcheon, Wednesday afternoon, when
his collar bone was fractured during
the R. O. T. C. physical training pe-
riod.

McCutcheon, being the “wheels” in
a wheelbarrow race, was running along
on his hands at a good speed, when
suddenly cne of his hands slipped and
he was thrown with great force on his
left shoulder.

For several minutes the accident was
not discovered because McCutcheon
bravely tried to pass it off as just a
slight injury, but several students soon
noticed that despite his efforts, it was
paining him greatly. McCutcheon was
hurried to the Infirmary by order of
the sergeant, where it was discovered
that his collar bone had been broken.

The injury, although not of a se-
rious nature, is very painful. Mc-
Cutcheon will probably be kept from
attending physical drill the rest of the
