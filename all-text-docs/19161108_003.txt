vine is the best that the college has seen;

for come time, tho very deceiving in its
Yooks. It looks like a copy of “Dr.
Somebody's Almanac,” but the contents
of the Magazine are pronounced by the
students in general as being of the high-
est quality. “The binding for this Maga-
zine is not the kind that was ordered,
and it will be impraved in the next issue.

some vood thoughts and are well writ-
ten. Especially to be mentioned is “The
Place of College Publications.” which
gives a very clear idea of the purpose of
our different college papers.

Among the stories. which are all vivid
and interesting, is “A Christmas Revel-

come only from the magazine of a South-
ern college.

The two poems in this issue are steps
to greater things. The great poets of

“Thoughts” by the Editor is

worth reading and thinking over.
