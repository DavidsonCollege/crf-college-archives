THE CHALLENGE.
Annie Dent Davis, Greensboro.

A trumpet call is sounding clear,
from over plain and hill.

‘Tis calling you; ’tis calling me, to
do our Captain’s will.

Oh there’s a battle raging wide, from
over sea and land.

Our Leader is the Lord of Hosts. Oh
hear His great command

Obey His marching orders that the
hosts of right may win

We fight the fiercest foe of all, of
unbelief and sin.

; He calls for heroes brave and strong
to heed His battle cry.

Yes, we must fight to right the
wrong, and some must even die.

It may take much of sacrifice to
leave our loved ones dear,

To give up all ambition for a future
great career.

But thousands made the sacrifice to
heed our country’s call.

‘Shall we, the Lord’s-own soldiers, do

the very least of all?

| challenge comes for Volunteers,
| to heed His great command,
To carry His own banner bright in
to every foreign land.

j What tho there may be dangers, or
| the way seem dark or drear?
Our mighty Leader calls us! Oh who

will Volunteer ?

“y” HOLDS VESPER SERVICES.
MR. MILES MAKES TALK.

A short vesper service was held
jin Shearer Hall last Sunday, which
was attended not only by the stu-
dents, but by a number of fair vis-
,itors as well. Mr. “Miles read the
sixth chapter of Matthew, and made
a short talk on the meaning and im-
portance of prayer. Several of the
students were called upon to pray,
and the service ended with the sing-
ing of a number of hymns.

South Carolina Game.

The Wildcats triumphed in the |

final game of the trip over Univer-

‘sity of S.C. by the score of 28 to 17,|

The game was fast. throughout, but
marred on several occasions by poor
shooting on the part of both teams.

The first half opened up with both
teams playing an offensive game,!
but neither being able to work the!
ball near enough to the basket for a
successful shot. The first minutes!
were nip and tuck, with Carolina’
having the.edge, on the large floor.’
Soon, however, the Wildcats opened
up a rapid-fire system of passing,
and got the jump of their opponents.
From this time on they were never.
headed. Brice put up a_ splendid
game at guard, while Romefelt led
the offensive. The first half ended
12 to 5, in the Wildcats’ favor.
| The University lads opened up an
attack which looked as if it would’
bring them within striking distance ,
at the beginning of the second
stanza, but the Wildcat defense ral-!

lied and put an end to it. Romefelt i

went wild in the final minutes of
play and shot three long shots which:
made victory certain. The passing;
of the Red and Black machine in the |
latter stages of the game baffled the
losers and frequent easy shots were
attempted only to be missed by poor
| judgment.

| The features of the game were the
playing of Foy at center for the los-
ers, and the splendid offensive com-
bination of Romefelt and Brice for;
the winners. The score:

Of our Training School for Life Insurance Salesmen recently produced
$308,000 in forty-five days. During the same period twenty-eight Train-
ing School men produced $2,594,000, an average of $92,000 per man.
When an agent signs a contract with the Southern Life and Trust
Company, we don’t pat him on the back, turn him loose and tell him to
“go to it.” We give him a preliminary correspondence course, and then
a course in our Training School at the Home Office, and then keep in
touch with him and help him overcome his weak points and strengthen
his strong points. As a result, our Training School men are making good.
Drop us a line and ask us to give you full particulars.
