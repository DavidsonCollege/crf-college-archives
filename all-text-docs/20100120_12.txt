’Cats down Eagles for 13th straight) Terriers deny Wildcats
time, keep pace in SoCon title race

Sprin*ing into 2010, the wom-
en’s basketball team has opened its
SoCon schedule with a 7-3 record.
Over the holiday weekend, the
*Cats split contests at College of
Charleston and Georgia Southern,
dropping the first matchup 78-84
and then coasting to a 68-50 win in
the second.

When classes concluded in De-
cember, the squad stormed into its
winter break contests. The Wildcats
flourished, beginning with a 90-68
romp of Wofford before a few days
off. The string of victories con-
tinued against Newberry College
(64-55), UNC-Greensboro (67-45),
Elon (82-73), and Longwood (69-
53).

Back at school, with all the
daily Davidson stress, the ’Cats en-
countered a few close competitive
matchups. The team snuck out of
Belk Arena on Jan. 9 with a thrill-
ing overtime win against Samford,

78-77. Conference star Emily Lon-
don single-handedly kept the Bull-
dogs in the game, as she racked up

35 points against the Davidson D.

“She was able to knock down
shots with our players’ hands in
her face,” Watts said. “There are
nights when shooters are simply in
the zone, and they will make shots
that seem impossible.” With Da-
vidson not short of its own power,
a last-second three by Ashley Lax
"11 propelled Davidson to the top
of the SoCon season rankings.

On the first day of classes after
break, the ’Cats stalled in a near
comeback against Chattanooga.
After cutting a double-digit lead
late in the second half, the squad
fell 62-64 to its perennial rival.

Watts downplayed the loss be-
cause it was the team’s fifth game
in 10 days, but team captains hope
the memory burns. Watts said Alex
Thompson °10 “encouraged her
teammates to feel the pain of a two-
point loss and never let it happen
again.”

Ashley Lax ’11 led all scorers with 17 points in the 'Cats’ loss at
College of Charleston over the weekend. The junior guard made
four three-pointers in the contest and leads the team with 34
made three-point field goals on the season.

Just a few days later, the *Cats
packed their bags for a road trip to
the Old South haven of Charleston,
South Carolina. Far from a lazy af-
ternoon at the beach, the matchup
pitted together two of the confer-
ence’s top teams.

Davidson spread the floor with
talent, while Charleston boasted
individual standouts. The top two
Cougar scorers combined for 54
points, while Davidson evenly dis-
tributed its tallies among five play-
ers in double figures.

Similar to the Emily London
challenge, the ’Cats dealt with the
difficulty of a conference “loaded
with good shooters this year,” as
Watts said. At halftime, Davidson

had fallen to a 29-48 deficit. By |
intermission, the contest seemed |°

nearly out of reach.

But over the second 20-minute
helping, Davidson served up con-
tinuous offensive pressure. With
2:13 left in the game, the squad had
cut the lead down to single digits
for good. But the effort arrived too
late, as a three at the buzzer from
Monica Laune ’!10 narrowed the fi-
nal score to a respectable 78-84.

For the ’Cats, newcomer So-
phia Aleksandravicius *13 posted
14 points and 10 boards for yet an-
other double-double. Laune led the
offense with 19 points, and Thomp-
son, Julia Paquette ’10, and Lax all
added double figures.

In search of warmer climates,
and hotter intensity, the team
journeyed to Statesboro, GA, for
a matchup against the Georgia
Southern Eagles. Of the previous
12 games between the two teams,
Davidson has won all 12.

The ’Cats grabbed a decent
lead in the first half, then held
tight. Consistent shooting main-
tained Davidson’s position on the
scoreboard, and defense steadily
improved over the course of the
game. As the Davidson D regained
its confidence from the two earlier
losses, it snuffed out Southern in
the second half.

Holding the Eagles to 17.9%
shooting in the second period, the
defensive front squashed any le-
gitimate comeback attempts. For
the first time in a few contests, the
*Cats stopped their opponent short
of the 50-point mark.

The men’s basketball team split
a pair of road games in South Caro-
lina last week, prevailing 86-81
over the Furman Paladins before
falling 68-62 against the Wofford
Terriers.

Against Furman, Will Archam-
bault 710 led the charge for David-
son, pouring in 15 points to lead the
squad. JP Kuhlman °13 added 14
points and a team-high six assists.
Steve Rossiter °10 chipped in 13
points and six rebounds while Jake
Cohen °13 contributed 11 points
and seven rebounds.

The Wildcats led the Paladins
by double digits for most of the sec-
ond half before surviving a furious
rally in the game’s final minutes.
Archambault’s free throw gave
Davidson a 76-62 lead with 1:50
remaining. The Wildcats, however,
then went cold from the foul line,
shooting only 9-16 from the charity
stripe in the final two minutes.

The Wildcats’ struggles from
the foul line coincided with Amu
Saaka’s attempt to bring Furman
back single-handedly. Saaka scored

ve Rossiter ‘10 scored a season-high 13 points and pulled
down six rebounds in last week’s 86-81 win at Furman. Rossiter
needs just 13 points and three rebounds to become the 30th Da-
vidson player to record 500 in both categories for his career.

as his squad scratched and clawed
its way back into striking distance.

The Wildcats’ lead was reduced
to 84-81 with nine seconds remain-
ing. Bryant Barr ’10 had an oppor-
tunity to ice the game but failed on
two foul shots. Archambault saved
Davidson, however, rebounding
the second miss and being fouled
himself with five seconds remain-
ing. His two foul shots produced
the game’s final margin.

Davidson shot only 41.4% (24-
58) from the floor on the night,
while allowing Furman to shoot
51.1% (24-47), including 50% (7-
14) from beyond the arc. The Wild-
cats made up for this discrepancy
by out-rebounding the Paladins
37-29, including a 16-6 edge on the
offensive glass and a 13-4 edge in
second-chance points. Free throw
shooting nearly undid the Wildcats,
who managed only a 63.6% (28-
44) effort from the charity stripe,
compared with the Paladins’ 72.2%
(26-36).

both sprint freestyle events in Saturday’s dual meet
at Virginia Tech. Martin outswam the competi-
tion with times of 23.72 and 51.87 in the so- and
100-freestyle events, respectively.

The senior guard scored 10 points and pulled down a
career-high 12 rebounds in Monday night's road win over
Georgia Southern. The double-double was Thompson’s
second of her career as she scored in double figures for
the ninth straight contest. She needs just 77 points for
1,000 in her career.
