80 years ago, Davidson pre-meds were accepted by school next door

By KENT DYER

With senior year upon him
the Davidson “cutthroat pre-
med’’ faces an interesting di-
lemma: he anxiously peers into
his post office box each day
hoping to find a heavy, rather
than light, envelope from medi-
cal school admissions. But at
the same time he is plagued by
the thought of having to leave
the ole alma mater. He is
further reminded of his plight
every time Dr: Fredericksen,
the Pre-medical advisor, proud-
ly advertises Davidson’s 83%
rate of acceptance into medical
school, and cringes at the
thought that he may be one of
the unlucky 17%.

What could be more empyreal
than enjoying the blige of-
havitrg your own medical school
at Davidson? The
woul® be numerous: The pre-
med:.acceptance rate would ~
surely increase sirice most of the
seats would be reserved for
Davidson graduates, Frederick-
sen would be all smiles, and
cutthroat competition ‘might e-
ven decrease a tiny bit.” .- ©

ell, the thirty ye&re-be-
twedh:1887 and 1907 were ones
of great ecstacy for all our
cutthroats...For during-that.z
period we enjoyed the monopoly’
of possessing the first chartered
medical school in the state, the
North Carolina Medical College.

advantages _

The college stood two doors
down from the Infirmary and
across from the Chapel, until it
was removed in 1970 as part of a
city beautification project. A-
bout all that can be.said about
the old Douglas House that held
the medical school from 1901 to
1907, is that it was a perfect
example of Victorian architec-
ture. .

The idea of the college origi-
nated with Dr. Paul Barringer
who came to Davidson as
college physician in 1886.

The pre-med at-that time was
expected to receive his under-
graduated training under the
private tutorage of an exper-
ienced physician. Dr. Barringer
sought to provide a more struc-
tured medival-education, and
began to tutor at the college in

his time off from-work. Soon his

> coutses in aridtomy, physsiol-

ogy, histology, and biology had
become so popular that his
home became known as the
medical school.
In 1887 Dr. Barringer left
Davidéon to teach at the Uni-
versity ‘of Virginia: and was
*-gucceeded by Dr.‘ John P.
Munroe as college physician.
Dr. Munroe bought the prepar-
atory school and came to be
. dcnown as-the father of the N.C.
‘Medical College. Under his
direction three professors were
employed to help with the
tutorial work, the school’s

course of studies was extended
to three years, and soon the
school became the first medical
college to be chartered in the

_ state.

In 1883 the college was
incorporated. That year it en-
rolled 44 students and grad-
uated its first class. The build-
ing across from the Chapel was
built to house the college in
1901. Complete with an ampi-
theater. for the students and a
“stiff house’ out back for
cadavers, the house was well
equipped. ”

In 1907 the entire school was
moved to Charlotte where it
continued for six years before
being incorporated into the

Medical College of ‘Virginia at | J

Richmond.

‘Many stories were told a-
mong the black population a-
bout this house where human
bodies were dissected. Thus
when a cadsver’s ‘remains were. .
discovered inside one of the

columns of Old Chambers, med- « |
ical students took. all the cregit. ....

The first x-ray'to be photo:
graphed in the United States
was the result of another prank
by medical students. Dr.
Smith, of the physics depart-

ment had, in January:of 1896,. -

acquired a Crook's tube similar
to the one used by Dr. Roentgen
in his experiments on X°ray
ethission. After hearing their
professor lecture on this new

.

‘invention three students, moti-

vated by their innate thirst for
knowledge, decided to try the
gadget out for themselves.
Breaking into the lab one night
they successfully photographed
a metal glass case hidden inside
a cardboard box. This discovery
was kept under wraps for days
for fear that the three would be
punished. But once the secret
leaked out and Davidson rea-
lized the significance of this
experiment, the charge of
breaking and entering was
dropped and the boys were
congratulated for their brilliant

efforts to further Davidson's
ion. —~

All in all, the North Carolina

Medical School, in its 30 years

of operation graduated 340 phy-

' sicians. Although the original

building in Davidson no longer
stands, the Charlotte branch,
located at the corner of Sixth
and Church Streets, is presently
known as Churchill apartments.
Dr. Beaty’s book, due to
become available in early No-
vember, will have an excellent
account of the medical school
and many other historic build-
ings of Davidson College.
