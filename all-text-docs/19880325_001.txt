Evolutionary theorist
speaks on equality

‘Gould launches Wearn Lecture Series

By JENNIFER HOFFMAN
Harvard Professor of Geology Stephen
Jay Gould works at the cutting edge of
scientific discovery. “We now have a
wealth of new and exciting data, some of
which is as recent as last week,” Gould
stated during his address, “Human Equality

isa Contingent Fact of History.” Hecontin-

ued, “The nice thing about talking about
such subjects is that youcan’tmerely repeat
old lectures.”

Gould’s speech launched the newly cre-
ated Wearn Lecture Series. The award-
winning author and expert in the field of
paleontological research addressed a near-
capacity audience in Love Auditorium
Tuesday night.

College President John Kuykendall in-
troduced Gould “as one of the most read-
able and understandable and appreciated
essayists in modern writing,” one who is
especially appealing “to those of us who
lack wide exposure to things scientific.”

Gould is well known for his theory: of
“punctuated equilibrium,” a major revision
of Darwin’s gradualism. He argues that
natural selection is not the steady, precise
progression Darwin envisioned; rather, it is
quirky and unpredictable.

Gould began by tracing a history of scien-
tific errors embedded in social prejudices.
“Until very recently scientific views, that
is, views by scientists, on the subject of race
and racial differences had supported the
social and political notion of ‘profound,
innate, ineradicable, necessary inequalities
in the intellectual abilities and moral be-
haviors of different human groups,” noted

Gould.

Similarly false preconceptions have been
applied to other differences such as sex and
social class as well, he said. “One group
serves as surrogate for the others, for the
general phenomenon of biological deter-
minism.”

Gould stressed that ties between science
and social influence are not necessarily
bad. “I’ve always seen this as a very posi-
tive aspect of science, It affirms science as
a human enterprise.”

Recent discoveries support Gould’s the-
ory of biological equality. Gould cited an
article run in Newsweek several weeks ago
reporting a study which traced genetic
changes in mitochondrial DNA. This DNA
evolves ten times faster than nuclear DNA,
and thus reveals greater mutation over a
shorter period of time. Of 1,400 base pairs
studied in 147 subjects, a sample which

represented the full spectrum of races, only ~

two “major branches on the evolutionary
tree” were revealed: one group consisted
only. of Africans, while the other group
included the rest of the Africans as well as
all other races on earth.

“We are all united in a much closer ;

genealogical nexus than we ever realized,”
concluded Gould. “We’re now beginning
to understand that the origin of our species,
homo sapiens, was a historical event that
occurred probably in Africa probably on
the order of 200,000 years ago, which is
yesterday for geologists, and which simply

Board approves 9. 7% fee hike

19.6% housing cost rise leads the march

- By GEORGE KURANI

Davidson’s Board of Trustees.

recently approved a 9.7 percent
tuition and fee increase for the
1988-89 school year, bringing the
comprehensive cost to $13,596.
This year’s fee hike is 1.4 percent
larger than last year’s raise of 8.3
percent.

Several factors led to the fee in-
crease. Davidson plans to increase
faculty salaries next year, espe-
cially at the assistant professor
level.

The college also plans to
broaden with an increase in com-

puters and computer facilities.
There will be an increase in com-
puter workstations for students as
well as more PCs available for the
faculty. Classroom computer aids
will also be added.

Funds have been approved to
use in the building of three dorms
and the hiring of personnel for
their maintenance. Personnel will
also be added in the following
departments: student — services
(counseling), admissions and fi-
nancial aid and physical plant.

The Board of Trustees has al-
loted 33 percent of the increase to

be used for student financial aid.
The 1988-89 college budget of
$29.2 million is a 14.5 percent
increase over the present budget
of $25 million. —
Although the tuition increase will
generate a little more than $1
million, the college will rely on
increased endownment. support
and fundraising to meet upcoming
needs.

Among particular increases in
next year’s fees, the highest oc-
