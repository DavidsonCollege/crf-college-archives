THE DAVIDSONIAN, MARCH 7, 1934

Ctarals Capture
Conference Title

The Washington and Lee Generals
last Saturday night captured the 1934
Southern Conference basketball cham-
pionship by defeating the Duke Uni-
versity Blue Devils, 30-29, in a startling
upset in the final game of the tourna-
ment.

The Generals reached the finals after
defeating Maryland, 45-37, in their first
. game, and then stopping North Caro-
lina State, 32-28, after State had elim-
inated the powerful South Carolina
Gamecocks in an upset victory, 43-24.

Duke had defeated V. M. I., 35-14,
and North Carolina, 21-18, thus secur-
ing the privilege to play the Generals
in the finals. North Carolina, ranked
high among the favorites, won their
first game from the University of Vir-
ginia, 27-18, but in their second con-
test they fell before the attack of the
Blue Devils.

In the final game, witnessed by about
3,000 persons, after the first half neither
team was able to gain a substantial
lead, and ‘the outcome was forever in
doubt until the final whistle.

The Blue Devils opened the game
setting a fast pace for the Generals,
and within three minutes they had
gained a lead of 7-0. This early attack
was led by Herb Thompson, Jim
Thompson, and Phil Weaver, who each
scored field goals, and Connie Mack,
who made good a free throw.

The Generals then scored five poirits
before the Dukes connected again,
three of which were made on foul
shots.

Duke began another spurt and be-
fore it was over they had gained a
lead of 13-7. This rally was also led
by the Thompson brothers and Connie
Mack.

Before the Generals came to life the
Blue Devils had marched on until they
had run their total to 21 points. Then
by a spectacular rally, led by Jones,
who scored two field goals, and Pette,
Sawyer and Smith, who accounted for
one goal each, the Virginians got back
into the game and as the half ended
they were behind only six points, the
score being 23-17 in Duke’s favor.

The last half was featured by a
scarcity of goals made. A number of
fouls were made by the Blue Devils
immediately after the opening of the
second half. These free throws, cou-
pled with several field goals, enabled
the Generals to take the lead at 25-25.

Three mintues were left to play and
the Virginia team was still leading,
28-27; then Herb Thompson sank a
brilliant shot from the side of the court
to send his team into a 29-28 lead with
only one minute left to play.

The Generals got the ball, and Saw-
yers, receiving a pass from Fields, shot
a long one, which hit high on the back-
board and bounced in the hands of
Joe Pette, W. & L. right forward, who
caught the ball with both hands and
hurled it into the basket to put the
Virginians in the lead, 30-29. With only
14 seconds left to play, the Devils were
unable to overcome even a one-point
yead, and Washington and Lee had
won the championship.

Golf Tournament To

. Be Played This Week

The long-awaited golf tournament
between the faculty and students will
be played about the middle of this
week unless inclement weather again
intervenes.

This tournament will serve as a pre-
liminary elimination for members of
the varsity team, eight men being
chosen at this time. The scores made
in the 36 holes of competition with the
faculty will determine these men, and
a later elimination to be held in Char-
lotte will cut the team to its usual four
members and two alternates.

Prof. F. E. Fulcher, faculty adviser
for the team, is working hard towards
plans for the coming season, and it is
hoped that the team, composed mainly
of new material, will chalk up its usual
good record.

Tennis Tournament Is

Postponed Until Mar, 6

The tennis tournament which was
originally scheduled for Tuesday,
March 6, was postponed one week and
will begin on Tuesday, March 13. This
postponement was due to wet courts.
All those wishing to take part in the
tournament will hand their names to
“Wee” Thompson.

Phi Society Discusses
Inflation of Currency

At its weekly meeting on Tuesday
night the Philanthropic Literary So-
ciety held a debate on the subject,
“Resolved: That the monetary system
of the United States should be revised
with a view to inflation.”

T. G. Thurston and C, A. Harper
upheld the affirmative of the question,
while W. C. Neill and J. M. Smith de-
fended the negative.

After the debate a discussion was
held in which all the members of the
society joined.

DR. T. H. SPARROW
GIVES LECTURE
(Continued from page 1)
and being but human, are stimulated
to make greater efforts.”

Dr. Sparrow first presented to the
listeners the question of the approxi-
mate expense of a medical education.
In answer to this he stated that it was
largely a matter of a person’s own
judgment. “Some students,” he illus-
trated, “spend over two thousand dol-
lars a year, although that is quite un-
necessary. The average student can
get along with half of that amount.”
Speaking of tuition, Dr. Sparrow re-
plied that the prices ranged from six
hundred and eleven dollars at Johns
Hopkins, to the minimum of seventy-
five dollars at the University of
Oregon.

When asked about the choice of
schools, the speaker stated that a stu-
dent should go to the school that he
wants to attend. However;-a school
should be selected that provides a well-
rounded course in science, especially in
biology, chemistry, and in physics. The
school should also have an “A” rating.
Another question brought up was
that concerning qualities necessary to
make a good doctor and what training
he should have. Dr. Sparrow answered
this by stating, “A physician should
have such personal qualities as intelli-
gence, character, and induction, the
whole tempered by an admixture
known as common sense. The mini-
mum requirements now,” he stated,

“are greater than those of any other
familiar profession. The universal
standard of requirements include at
least two years of pre-medical work at
college,four—years-of-medical_school,
and then at least one year of hospital
training.” The speaker also added that
a college degree was advisable, al-
though not absolutely necessary.

Dr. Sparrow pointed out that the
prospective medical student should by
all means major in science. However,
he advised every man to take up some-
thing that he will never have an op-
portunity to take again in order that
he will broaden his knowledge and
his views. Dr. Sparrow also recom-
mended that students participate in
cultural subjects and in college extra-
curricula activities as these all go to
stregnthen his personality and conse-
quently his business practice later.

The speaker also called attention to
the fact that, at present, there is a
strong tendency for men to go into
specialization, and.as a result of this,
there is much keen competition. On
the other hand, the speaker pointed
out, there is a great need for skillful
general practitioners and this field of-
fers many attractions and great pos-
sibilities.

In closing, Dr. Sparrow stated that
one of the greatest fields open to med-
ical ‘men today is that of psychiatry.
“This field,” he added, “concerns itself
primarily with the subconscious mind
and seeks to discover by psychoanal-
ysis the causes for certain fears and
attitudes which people have. The pur-
pose is to promote normal thinking and
acting, and to develop healthy think-
ing as a condition for healthy heing
and acting.”

PRESIDENT RESIGNS
LENOIR-RHYNE POST
(Continued from page 1)
purpose of taking definite action on a
plan of reorganization which Dr.
Schaeffer had presented to the board
on February 8 was intensified into a
decisive session, when members of the
Alumni Association and of the student
body became a®itated over the ques-
tion of reported changes being pro-

posed, and circulated petitions in pro-
test.

In taking action on these petitions
when presented Tuesday afternoon, the

trustees took the position that these}

were due largely to “misunderstanding
and misinformation.” Chairman Moretz
expressed the view that a distorted no-
tion on the part of many persons con-
cerning what Dr. Schaeffer was pro-
posing aggravated the situation- and
caused many unfortunate  conse-
quences,

In his letter of resignation, Dr.
Schaeffer intimated that a member of
the faculty had been guilty of a be-
trayal of trust resulting in misrepre-
sentation of the facts with reference to
his proposed program of reorganiza-
tion for the college.

In the main, it was declared by mem-
bers of the Board of Trustees, the plan
of reorganization of Dr. Schaeffer was
approved with the exception of his de-
sire to do away with intercollegiate
athletic contests. The board voted to
continue the athletic program as at
present, but indicated a willingness to
institute a program of physical educa-
tion to care for the student body as
a whole, as suggested by Dr. Schaeffer.

—— Men and women

say They Satisfy

OR SOMETHING to “‘satisfy’’
you, means that it pleases you

—that it’s what you want.

This

applies to cigarettes or anything.
A cigarette has to taste right —
not raw or too sweet. For a ciga-
rette to “satisfy” it has to be mild
—not strong, not harsh.
You can prove for yourself
whether a cigarette is milder—

whether a cigarette tastes better.
