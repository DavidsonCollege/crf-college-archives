A START FROM SCRATCH

Last year the Wildcat netters reigned supreme in the
tennis circles of the Southern Conference but this season
they have won six of their 12 matches, not a spectacular
record. What has made the difference?

Obviously the loss of players has been the stumbling
block. Six of the top six men of 1955 have either changed
schools or graduated, including Lacy Keesler and Corky
Clark who played each other for the conference champion-
ship last year. John Robinson, a junior who alternated
at the six and seven position last year has held down the
number one bracket most of this season. Backing him up
have been four freshmen and a lone sophomore, not an
impressive team on paper.

The squad has made up for their decrease in experience
by an increase in inter-team competition. As Robinson, the
captain, put it, “nearly every man out there figures that he
can beat the next man so it keeps everyone on his toes.’ Con-
sequently the boys have been working harder than they would
if they thought their positions were secure. Semi Mintz moved
up frony the number three position to the top of the ladder
just last week. John Poindexter started at number six and is
now playing at four.

A HEAVY LOAD FOR A NEW FOUR

The newcomers are no strangers to the courts. Dave
Pearsall won the North Carolina State High School Singles
crown in 1954. A Raleigh boy that he met in the semi-finals
of the same tournament last year was Semi Mintz. Dave
finally won that match but not until after three sets that lasted
a total of four hours. John Poindexter saw action at McCallie
Prep for three years, and Bob Huffaker played second to
Pearsall at Myers Park High in Charlotte.

Down through the years the Wildcat netters have al-
ways held a position of esteem. In the days of the former big
Southern Conference Davidson always ranked third behind
Duke and North Carolina. When the latter two joined the
ACC in 1952, the Wildcats were left on top of the heap where
they have remained until this year.

A HAZY OUTLOOK

. And this season? Thus far no conference team has
bettered the Cats, but the big powers will not be met until
the Conference Tournament in Williamsburg, Virginia, May
1, 2 and 3. Davidson scored 24 points in that last year and
has not one returning letterman, William and Mary scored
17 and has five returnees, Richmond scored 14 and has
six returnees.

However the Red and Black squad is not without
hope for they have been learning by playing some of the
best teams in the East. Michigan State won the Big Ten
in 1952 and could do it again this year. North Carolina
and Duke are traditional court powers. Colgate, Rollins,
and Kalamazoo all rank in the top ten on the eastern
seaboard.

Said Coach McKee on why he schedules such difficult
opponents, “It is for the boys’ own good. If they are going
to improve they must play top flight competition.”
mentioned that students will turn out to watch matches with
teams that boast such standouts as Kalamazoo’s Dodson, who
made honorable mention on the Junior Davis Cup team.

The Wildcats will enter the tournament next month as
definite underdogs for the first time in several years, but
their competitive spirit and recent experience could cause
them to show surprise strength.

Advantage, You

You'll make more fine shots with these rackets
than any in their class.

The reason? Both the Spalding KRo-BaT®
and the Spalding-made Wright & Ditson Davis
cup® deliver the ‘‘feel”” you must have for full
power and better control.

Both come in every weight and grip size for
better tennis, match after match.
