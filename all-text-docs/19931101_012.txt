THE DAVIDSONIAN _OPINIONS MONDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 1993

*

Despite rumors to the con-
trary, some of your parents were
once young.

Over forty years ago and 400
miles to the north, linflicted on my

unsuspecting classmates the first

“Gull’s Nest” (as tacky a title then
asitis today). Asits inheritor, Bill
has been good enough to let me fill
in for him from time to time (a sort
of “Family Circus” in reverse),
even though I sometimes quote
Democrats and, long ago, outgrew
my craving for tobacco. I’m
obliged tothe editors of The David-
sonian for going along with this.
Parents Weekend seems an appro-
priate time.

Alas, Davidson does not yet
enjoy quite the recognition in our
environs that it has held for so long
in the South. My wife Betsy and I
are still bemused by friends who
ask how Bill likes “Denison” or
“Dickinson” or whatever. That’s
fine. As things are going, by the
end of this century, Davidson will

: be harder to get into than Harvard.
Success presents its own chal-
lenges. Alot of us may have made
it just in time.

And yet as this college be-
comes more truly national, and
indeed international, each year, I
still strongly suspect that it has
changed remarkably little in terms
of anything that really matters—
that old grads would recognize the
outlines of the same verities. Any
clergyman will tell you that the
newly converted can be more vis-
ibly devout than birthright believ-
ers. To me, as the oldest (dare we
say “chronologically challenged?”)
member of a new Davidson fam-

ily, perhaps the most significant
thing about Davidson is the decep-
tively simple conclusion that it re-
ally is what it purports to be.

In the Watergate hearings,
John Erlichman, debating some
document, asked of the venerable
chairman, Senator Sam Ervin,
“How did you come to that conclu-
sion?” Ervin replied in a level
voice I can still hear, “Because it
was written in English, and En-
glish is my native tongue.”

 Unadorned English is not the
native tongue of much of academia
today. I believe it still is at
Davidson. Honor is not subject to
qualification. Of course, we all
share a common imperfectibility,
but one can no more be selectively
honorable than partially pregnant.
It seems to me that is why, for
example, it is peculiarly challeng-
ing here to evolve a new alcohol
policy that merges common sense

with the limits of the law. At other
colleges, this is difficult enough;
at Davidson, itrequires aSolomon-
like resolution with honor. While
noone comes to Davidson with the
expectation that it will be easy,
there are surely other rewards.
Just before driving down to
“Discover Davidson” inthe spring
of 1992, I happened to glance at
the national magazine of my own
fraternity, Sigma Chi. Its theme
was on the unlikely subject of “di-
versity.” I don’t remember much
diversity in any dimension when I
was an undergraduate at my own
college. In any case, among the
pivotal dates cited was 1967. In
that year, our Davidson chapter
decided to go local, at least in part
because they intended to pledge a
black student. It’s pretty clear that
the sense of inclusion is not a re-
cent development at Davidson.

Pop art cover intended to inspire laughter & thought

Jerry continued from page 9

We stopped short, however, of ac-
tually explaining the punchline
about “Sam.”

Of course, there are many
other contexts in which to view
this image or any other image, in-
cluding personal context, our own
interior history that each of us
brings to any image that we look
at. Allow me to illustrate my point
with a personal example. My only
other direct reaction to the cover
came from Sherburne Laughlin
83, current President of the Alumni
Association and one of the orga-
nizers of the recent campus cel-
ebration of 20 Years of Coeduca-
tion. Every year we hand out the
new diréctories at the October
trustee meeting. I personally
handed a copy to Sherburne, who
had no prior explanation or discus-
sion about the cover. Sherburne
took one look at it, burst out laugh-
ing, and said, “Great cover! Thanks
for doing this.” You’re welcome,
Sherburne. Thanks for having a
sense of humor.

But as I think back on
Sherburne’s reaction in light of
this question of personal context, it
makes a lot of sense. First, I have
known Sherburne since she was a
student and have worked with her
on several projects through the
years. I like her and I think she
likes me. She knows me well
enough to know how I feel about
coeducation and women’s issues.
Second, I think Sherburne under-

stood the'visual reférbhce to’Pop -

Art and third, I know she immedi-
ately understood the reference to
Sam Spencer. Put that all together,
and her spontaneous reaction of
laughter and appreciation make
sense.

As to Professor Kaylor’s re-
action to the cover, I simply do not
understand it no matter how hard I
try. I have looked at the cover
every which way including upside
down and I can’t see what he sees
in the image. If it were a Beatles
album I would put it on a turntable
and play it backwards to hear if it
whispered “Paul is dead” or “Girls
are yucky” or “We don’t want them
here” but that can’t be done. Ihave
tried to imagine the personal con-
text in which he views the cover,

‘ butI can’t dothateither. The whole -

thing remains a mystery to me.

The Davidson Context

As for negative reactions from
students, Ican understand that more
readily. In terms of personal con-
text, very few students know who
Iam or who Mike is, so they can’t
use that as a contextual clue. And
how many are aware of the Pop Art
phenomenon of the late sixties?
Probably very few, for the style
came and went before they were
even born. And how many would
understand the line about “Sam”?
Admittedly, very few again.

So I can understand if some
students were initially confused or
upset by the cover. But I hope they
will not be carried away by their
emotions, but can instead turn this
intoa learning experience. We live

arid work dnd‘play in this ldbora+"-

tory for the liberal arts we call
Davidson. And we often describe
ourselves as a community, and we
are, but at times it is a contentious
one. Ample evidence for this can
be found on the pages of the David-
sonian week after week, where the
level of civil discourse is not al-
ways so Civil.

In fact, [understand that there
has been considerable campus dis-
cussion of the cover this past week.
Nina Serebrennikov tells me that
she used it as an example in a
lecture on “Images of Women in
Art and Advertising” and that it
generated considerable debate. I

. believe this is good, so long as

these discussions generate more
light than heat, for that represents
the very best spirit of intellectual
and spiritual inquiry which is es-
sential to this liberal arts commu-
nity.

I wish we could take credit for
doing the telephone directory cover
in order to stimulate a high-level
campus debate on images of
women in American culture, but
again I can’t. Our goal really was
more simple — we were just trying
to have some fun. Some may now
say, Okay, I still don’t think it’s
funny. Fine. I don’t ask that you
share our sense of humor. I do ask
that you not jump to conclusions
and assume that we must be mali-
cious orincredibly naive, or heaven
help us, politically incorrect.

In other words, please lighten
up. It’s only humor; it won’t hurt
you. Had | it ey even in mnake ig

_ Guest House (is therea more agree-

able place to stay on campus?),
take a look at the 1970 yearbook on
the second floor hall table. Not all
those fraternities are still at
Davidson, but hopefully Saturday
night at Patterson Court will al-
ways have the aspect of a neigh-
borhood block party open to all. It
seems to me I read somewhere last
spring that there is more that unites
than divides you. A new College
Union will only enhance all this,
notreplaceit. Bearin mind that the
architect of the Visual Arts Center
is noted for his renovations. Any-
one energetic enough to attempt
Davidson shouldn’t find any place
on this spacious campus all that
inconvenient.

One can learn a great deal by
reading letters to The Davidsonian.
Atthe height of this “apathy” busi-
ness last year, a student wrote that,
after swimming and studying, he
simply didn’t have time for very
much else. It’s sadit’sso. Anyone
smart enough to be admitted to
Davidson has the capacity to orga-
nize his or her own time so that a
great many activities can be ac-
commodated. However, if you’ll
permit amodicum of pontification,
I think it is worth stressing that life
is infinitely more than a series of
tasks to be performed.

A lot of the fun in attending
even the most selective of colleges
should be spontaneous. Iflife were
fully explicable, all the cool fresh-
men wouldn’t be in Watts Hall
every year.

Moreover, I believe it was
Socrates who suggested that, the
unexamined lifeisn’t worth living.
(Bear with me; I didn’t have the
advantage of Humes.) No. one
arrives at so advanced a chronol-
ogy as mine without affirming that
the most enduring experiences of
college were outside the class-

room—and with a faculty so ac-
cessible as yours, some of the best
teaching, as well.

Perhaps my most vivid
memory of our family’s first year
as members of the Davidson com-
munity derives from last fall’s
Convocation.

Seated up on the balcony steps
with Ross Lenhart, we heard the
words of a Southern writer and
poet named Reynolds Price. No
one who was there will likely for-
get it. Price delivered notso much
an address as a recitation of po-
etry—everything from his remote
kinsman John Milton to some of
his own. I am embarrassed to say
I knew nothing of Price. Subse-
quently, my wife, whois both more
literate and more erudite than Iam,
was good enough to bring mesome
of his work.

Even more than the fiction, I
was impressed by Price’s reminis-
cences of his childhood, in a book
called Clear Pictures. While ail-
ing, Price notes that he has already
lived longer than had his own fa-
ther, Will, and concludes in this
way: “So I sit at this desk most
days still, older than Will managed
to be, in more or less steady thanks
tothemandasmallclutchofothers .
for basic training in independence,

_ dependence, hunger, feeding, fire-

works, and damage control, alive
at creation and its hid guardian.
Maybe I see that the aim of their
schooling was something as nearly
impossible as courtesy. Courtesy
in the broad continuous sense, not
the merely polite.”

Courtesy. Civility. Coopera-
tion. Community. When you fi-
nally enter that “real world” out-
side, I hope it doesn’t sound exces-
sively naive to suggest that you
might brighten some corner of it
with what you broughtto Davidson,
anid-what Davidson gave to you.

The library is a microcosm

Rick continued from page 10

the core of Davidson. What you
see here is what really lies beneath
those social first floor exteriors
and the playing-at-studying but
really doing otherthingsunderlayer
of the second floor. —

Down here there are barely
any windows to what’s going on
“out there:” Even the newspapers
are old.

Allthecarrels are full of people
who are actually studying. They
even have that look on their face.
Very few walkmans.

Should that be walkmen? Very

little conversation. This is what
Davidson is all about; a bunch of
individuals studying their khaki-
clad butts off so they can geta good
job. If you go down there and
really look, you can actually see a
few butts, wrapped in swaddling J.
Crew cloth, just rolling around.

For all their big talk about -
taking atest cold or writing apaper
the morning of, this is what people
at Davidson do.

They descend into their own
little world, cram their heads with
soon-to-be-forgotten facts and no-
tions, then they get out before that
crazy siren goes off.

Directories are far from "travesty"

Phone continued from page 8

this good-natured parody is so
funny—or indeed works at all.
“Pop Art is liking things,” Andy
Warhol is reported to have said;
“The things that I have apparently
parodied I actually admire,”
Lichtenstein insisted. And surely
Errol Gibson, like the pop artist
Roy Lichtenstein his design so
cleverly invokes, intends what any
artist intends—to presenta subject
in an unforeseen way that allows
the viewer to engage with the sub-
ject and perceive it anew.

The gulfs of gender between
human beings like all other gulfs

between selves are real and Pro-
fessor Kaylor is right to remind us
of the way our language and im-
ages can subvert out best efforts to
bridge them. The images wesee of
ourselves do matter, but laughter
does too. To this viewer, at least,

the cover of the new telephone

directory is funny, engaging, more
than a little reminiscent of the
Lichtenstein poster on my own
dorm room wall 25 years ago—
and bright enough to find amid the
debris on my desk. I like it.
Sincerely, al
Gail M. Gibson
