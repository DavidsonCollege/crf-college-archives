Once upon‘a time there was a man ©

who saw the need for a lawn, He

saved up his own money. bought the —

seed. and planted. He then offered ;

good salary to the best team of lawn
mowers to cut it. There was but one ©
policy he required of these mowers: —
that they agree to cut the lawn two —
inches thick. This seemed fair.. -after ‘

all, it was his lawn.

One day a new mower came seeking .
employment with the team. But after .

having the requirement explained to

him, and much to the man’s surprise, _
the mower disagreed with the policy

and wanted the requirement changed. .
It is weird...it seems that if the
mower didn’t want to respect the
man’s requirement, then he would
just seek another lawn with a diffe-
rent policy—for doesn’t a man have
the right to have his own lawn the
way he wants it?

To the Trustees of Davidson College:

In light of recent events at Davia-
son College we have felt prompted as
a group to consider the entire issue of
the relationship of Davidson College
to the Presbyterian Church.

We as a group would like to
strongly urge the Trustees of David-
son College to seriously and deliber-
ately consider what is meant by
Davidson’s commitment to be a
Christian college. We urge the Trus-
tees to carefully consider and clarify
for the Davidson community how a
Christian education and a Christian
college ought to differ from their
secular counterparts. How should
Davidson express its Christian com-
mitment? Ought its Christian com-
mitment to be reflected in its curricu-
lum, faculty and administration, stu-
dents, and community life?

In each case we feel that all would
benefit from practical guidelines
formulated in light of a clearly defined
wholistic view of Christianity and
education.

As Christians we would affirm and
advocate the College’s Statement of
Purpose. We too believe Jesus Christ
to be the central fact of history and
the source of all truth. We too wish to
guarantee a hearing for the historic
Christian faith. But Christianity has
nothing to fear from an honest search
for the truth.

In light of the recent controversy
we think the relationship between the
so-called Christian Tenure Policy and
the personal character of the faculty
and administration needs a careful
re-evaluation. Regardless of the facul-
ty’s personal religious convictions we
have not observed the orientation and
presentation of our course work to
differ significantly from what our
contemporaries experience at avowed-
ly secular institutions.

We are afraid of the diminished
quality of scholarship which may
indirectly result from continuance of
the Christian Tenure Policy. Worse,
we fear the institutionalizing of an
empty religious formalism, a process
which may have already begun.

Practically, the Christian Tenure
Policy may not secure the best-quali-
fied scholar who is also a Christian
but instead a less-qualified candidate
who is willing to outwardly conform
to some arbitrary demonstration of
his commitment.

| “Attentive boycott vis visages

We as Christians and as students
question the effectiveness, practicali-
ty, and advisability of continuing the
Christiaf’ Tenure Policy as it is
presently formulated.

We urge the Trustees to consider
the issues carefully: both the implica-
tions of Davidson’s commitment to be
a Christian college and the effective-
ness of the Christian Tenure Policy in
achieving that end. Surely our
Christian commitment means more

than withholding tenure from non-
Christians.

To the Editor:

I am writing in reference to your
issue of April 22; and the cartoon
depicting Chambers building with a
sign proclaiming ‘‘No Jews need
apply.”” Now I realize that the
cartoonist has to draw what he is told
to draw, and that this one was not his -
idea. Still, I see in it a symptom of
something that has happened to The
Davidsonian since the change of
editorship.

It seems that almost every article
you've printed in the last few months
has prompted the people involved to
write back, complaining that your
facts are not quite straight and that
you have missed the point of the issue
at hand. But when people like Dana
English, John Kello, William Work-

To the Editor:

I would like to express my views on
the recent dispute on the college’s
constitutionalized religious discrimi-
nation policy. I do not attempt to
glorify anyone but to reveal the
compelling justifications for Presi-
dent Spencer’s iron rule against
unanimous consent.

It is really alarming that news of
the dismissal of Prof. Linden leaked
out so soon— before the Convocation.
Secrecy is the accepted standard
practice of our one-man top executive
committee, and I hope undesirable
leakage like this will never happen
again. To achieve the utmost efficien-
cy of the top elite, it is absolutely
unthinkable that the sovereign
power be challenged or even be

doubted. Administrative and political ,

matters are of profound unconcern for

to write, I begin to wonder about the
objectivity of your reporting. Because
‘your coverage of the Linden affair
distorted the issue into ‘Spencer fires
Linden because he is a Jew’’, you’ve
greatly defused what little influence
the student body might have had in
clearing the real issue.

The main problem I see is that The
Davidsonian has consistently taken
up an adversary position in every
decision made on campus, whether
there is an issue or not. It’s
almost like you don’t feel your paper
is complete unless you’re decrying

_ some evil or injustice that has been

perpetrated, usually by the Adminis-
tration. The cumulative effect of this
is that when a real issue comes up,
such as the dismissal of Linden, I find
it howl ¢9.teke your article seriousty.

the students. It is by the imperial
grace that you are granted exemption
from worrying about the actions from
the throne. After all, every deed is
made sure to have a legitimate basis.

| Please be settled to books and to the

practice of Christian faith. It is my
humble suggestion ‘that appropriate

| security means be employed to guard

against future leakage of top secrets
which would lead to undesirable

| effects on the regime.

To understand the action of the

: President, we have to realize the value

of conservatism, the regime’s basis
for support, the power of written
laws, and monarchical solidarity. It is
in the interest of the governing body
(who wants to stay in power) that
status quo is assured. Progressive
ideas like equality, democracy, free-
dom of interference, and religious
tolerance will endanger the ruthless
and impressive efficiency of the top

| administration to carry out its order.

In a one-party one-man system,

+ non-homogeneity would lead to diver-

sification of interests, thus polluting
the doctrine. Surely this is not what
a liberal arts college wants.

Try to compare to a comb of honey
bees; symmetry is beauty. Inertia not
only “inspires acquiescence but also
.nakes the alternatives to acquies-
cence appear, to anybody except
passionate partisans of violence, dis-
tasteful.”

If liberal practices and -intellectual
progress are what you want to seek in
this place, all I can say to you folks is:
sorry. Above all, they are the
distinguished administration and the
discriminatory policy that make this
institution ‘‘one of the finest in the
south.”

Also, we must not ignore the fact
that this is.a church-related institu-
tion, and a significant portion of our
financial support comes from church-
related factors. Any possible dissen-
sion to Christian faith (as judged by
the top administration) will be too
much of a threat to our economy.

It is my regret that Prof. Linden
has been so foolhardily ‘‘outspoken’’;
unable to adapt to our society. But
fear not. Though we might have lost a
competent Dr. L, there are numerous
ideally qualified Dr. S’s waiting
eagerly to fill the vacancy.

Glory be to the Fourth Reich!

Jones berates Davidsonian

You’ve been crying “wolf” too long
already.

I feel like every article you write is
going to have its own built-in bias,
which will color the facts. It’s almost
as if you decide what you're going to
write beforehand, and then go out
looking for the facts to support it.

All I am asking for is some more
objective, responsible, journalism.
The Davideonian is not yours to do
with as you wish; and the student
body is not an audience that must
accept whatever you feel like
throwing it.

We all care about this college, and.
all we from The Davidsonian is

| to provide the facts first and fore-
most, nor Your verdict on who's right
and wes wrong.
