NEW BUILDING

Last Commencement
On May 20, rood, the cornerstone of
the New Chambers Building was laid
with appropriate exercises. The laying
of this marked a great
step forward for the College, and this
fact clearly presented to those

Mr, Williams reviewed the history of
education in) North Carolina before
the founding of Davidson, brought
out the need then existing for a small
school with high ideals and with men
of character to direct it, and the need
for a school of higher learning to give
men well-rounded classical
tion.

Tn 1837 the college opened, and be-
gan its task of turning out men for all
walks of life. The need for adequate
buildings was keenly felt, and in 1855
Mr. Maxwell Chambers, of Salisbury,
provided by his will a gift of $200,000.00
With this money
the historic old Chambers building was
erected and the cornerstone was laid
in 1858. For 65 years this building was
the center of activities—until it was de

an enor-
mous handicap since this great, loss
and only through the tireless efforts
of the trustees and officers of the col-
lege is this about to be overcome.

Mr. Williams pointed out in his
address some of the ideals for which
Davidson stood. He showed that the
leaders. of Davidson were not striving
to aid men in the mere accumulation
of knowledge but in the acquiring of

a real education, which goes deeper
than mere storing ‘up of facts. He il-
lustrated this point by the heroic
achievements of Col, Chas. A. Lind-
bergh:

“Not all of the knowledge of the

human race, if it could have been put
at Lindbergh's disposal, could have in-
sured the success of his trans-Atlantic
flight. True, much information that
he had was valuable and helpful in the
extreme, but ‘out there’ he had to meet
conditions which no man had known,
he had’ to make decisions with which
no other man had ever
fronted, had to lay courses which
no other man had ever been called up-
on to lay

and everything had to be
upon penalty immediate im-
pending death. Mere knowledge failed
him early, but, equipped with an edu-
cation in aeronautics and fortified with
sterling traits of splendidly developed
character, he carried on to a
complete like was his
experience as he left our shores to fly
over an unchartered sea to that of a)
young man leaving college halls to voy-
age the sea of an uncertain life whose
scenes are moving so fast that ere he

tinguished himself by finding a

Unknown to themselves, 30 success-

used as laboratory specimens,
ing the mental and emotional traits of
college men who cheat at examina-
tions—and get away with it.

Information about the 30 was ob-
tained by underground and unofficial
channels, Professor Brownell states in
reporting his investigation. None of
the cheaters was caught by a
severe proctoring system,

Eighty per cent of the group were
found to be more psychroneurotic,
emotionally unstable than the campus
average. More than half fell below
the college average in intelligence, and
the majority belonged to the type
known as psychological extroverts
that good social mixers and more
inclined to activity than thinking.
“Contrasted the student

‘type,’ Brownell concludes,
“THis low intelligence may make cheat
ing somewhat of a necessity. His ex-
troversion may operate further
this. His emotional instability make
it easier for the spirit to succumb un-
der the twofold necessity.”

More than half the college cheating
would be eliminated if this psycholog-

team and track contests, glee clubs,
dramatic productions, and other book-

Drawing Attention

Twenty-five yards to the read of the
| four historic old “Columns of Cham-
ibers,” there have risen six majestic
pillars—each symbolic of the progress
of Davidson: College to a higher and
better plane of learning.

Last commencement when the cor-
nerstone was laid to a newly started
building, the students had no idea that
the building would look so nearly com-
pleted as it did when school opened
this fall. The left wing already has
most of the roof-base finished, the wir-
ing and plumbing connections ready,
the plastering base being put up.

When a spasmodic series of loud
taps began piercing the quiet of the
classroom—and the windows were
hurriedly pulled, down to exclude the
noise, everyone knew that the riveters
were busy. Steel girders are being
riveted into place for the roof of the
auditorium, Many students stand op-
en-mouthed and sunburn their tonsils
watching the handy-men throw red-
hot rivets to men far above who catch
them in buckets and then transfer
them to their place in the girders.
Compressed air riveters, with their
toud toccato of taps—beat the rivets
into place.

Lincoln-Douglas
Galesburg, Ill, Oct. 24—(IP) —On
the seventieth anniversary of the fa-
mous debate on slavery between Ab-
raham Lincoln and Stephen A. Doug-

las, Knox college was the scene of a
reproduction of the famous encounter
on the exact site where the statesmen
met in 1858.

A platform was erected near the
east door of the “Old Main” building,
a historic structure on the Knox col-
lege campus.

Seventy years ago some twenty
thousand persons came to Galesburg
by wagon and train, to hear Lincoln
and Douglas put forward their views
on the most important issue of the day.

A few of that gathering who are
still living were the honored guests of
Knox College’ at the celebration,

At the time of their meeting here
Lincoln and Douglas were candidates
for the United States Senate. Senator
Douglas, Democrat, won, but out of
these debates grew the overwhelming
sentiment which was soon to make
Lincoln president of the United States.

“Old Main,”s by one side of which
the two argued is the one remaining
structure on the Knox campus asso-
ciated with their series of debates.

It has been proposed that the build-
ing be made a _ permanent Lincoln
shrine.
