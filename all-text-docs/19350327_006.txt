THE DAVIDSONIAN, MARCH 27, 1935

China Is Topic
Of Noted Speaker

(Continued from Page r)
and settled, down to our modern days,

He recalled the days of the Opium
War in which Great Britain not only
forced upon China the drug trade much
against her will, but succeeded in open-
ing to the world five mor€ treaty ports,

When China, soon after the close of
this war, showed her resentment toward
foreign interference by firing upon am-
bassadors going to Peking, she aroused
the hatred of the world in general, but
we should realize that it was only an
expression of their fear, misunderstand-
ing, and mistrust of all that the western
civilization had done to them. The act
is to be condemned, but the cause can
hardly be.

In retaliation the English destroyed
one of the finest pieces of Oriental
architecture and scattered the finest art
collections theri existing in the world—~
the royal summer palace. Thus did
western civilization triumph over east-
ern!

This type of treatment has continued
almost up to the present day, until the
recent Nationalist movement has caused
the aggressive westerner to be more
considerate of his actions,

Aggression has been reduced, but by
no means obliterated. Professor Wan-
nemaker described an arch at the gate
of a public park in the foreign settle-
ment of Shanghai upon which was writ-
ten “Chinese and Dogs Not Admitted.”
Such things as that can hardly produce
a friendly feeling between the people
of China and other nations. He cited
another incident in which British police
fired upon a group of Chinese students,
killing eleven of them, under conditions
which in no way warranted the action.

The Boxer Rebellion in more recent
times was a result of fear and mistrust
of foreigners, stirred up by radicals of
the country. It was not an expression
of hatred as a national feeling so much
as of fear. The people are on the whole
very friendly toward foreigners.

In regard to the progress of the
Chinese people, Professor Wannemaker
said that we see little of it in our papers,
but rather find the sensational events
and radical movements. Her cities are
introducing electric lights, water sys-
tems, paving programs, and other im-
provements, China has 40,000 miles of
improved roads, and her educational sys-
tem is steadily improving; all of these
things are marks of western civilization.

Of her 460,000,000 people, seventy to
eighty per cent are illiterate still, in
spite of her advancement in learning,
so we should consider her educational
handicap when dealing with the nature
of China as a Whole. Also we might
well remember that when Europe was
just beginning its climb to the top,
China had a civilization which was the
most highly developed on earth. She
may in a backward condition now,
but is beginning her comeback.

With a few remarks about the schools
and colleges of China, Professor Wan-
nemaker showed a series of slides which
illustrated the work being at
Lingnan University. These slides, ac-
companied by his remarks on the edu-
cational possibilities among the Chinese,
brought. his lecture to an end.

An unusually large crowd attended
the lecture in spite of the heavy rain
which came just at its beginning.

The acting of the cast was excellent
and adds glory to the Red and Black

achievement in dramatic art.

There was no admission charge. How-
ever, the free-will offering that ‘was
taken to help defray the expences of
production of the play amounted to over
seventeen dollars.

Dr. McBride Confers
On Child Labor Laws

Duncan G, MacBride, a graduate of
Davidson College, left Richmond for
New York City to confer with leaders
of the National Child Labor Committee.

This conference is to be devoted
mainly to securing information and codp-
eration toward improving the child labor
laws of the State of Virginia.

Mr. MacBride graduated from David-
son with Phi Beta Kappa honors and
is now a senior at Union Theological
Seminary in Richmond, Va.

for the past five years and has made in-
roads into campuses of mid-western col-
leges and universities.

-O, D. K. fraternity has shown sub-
stantial growth since its establishment
in 1914. Eight new chapters have been
inaugurated since their meeting two
years ago and other circles are under
consideration at this time, stated the
Davidson College treasurer. At pres-
ent, the fraternity contains forty chap-
ters in its organization.

One hundred and twenty-five college
and university representatiyes assembled
from the forty circles at the conclave in
Cincinnati.

It was at this eleventh national con-
ference that the fraternity set its eyes to
the future, observed Brown, He con-
tinued that the delegates endeavored to
frame a policy for future activity in cir-
cles already established that will tend
to equip the campus members of Omi-
cron Delta Kappa society with that atti-
tude of mind and spirit most suited to
the social needs of this age.

The twelfth biennial conelave is
scheduled to meet at Atlanta, Georgia,
in 1937, Emory University and Georgia
Tech will act as joint hosts to the fra-
ternity on this occasion,

The University of Cincinnati, which
acted as host for the O. D. K. fraternity
convention, is a large municipally con-
trolled and supported institution with an
enrollment of approximately ten thou-
sand students. Students in the technical
division attend classes one month and
work the next. This plan is observed
throughout the entire year.

In 1917 the Delta Circle was estab-
lished at Davidson. This honorary so-
ciety recognizes men who have attained
a high standard of efficiency in, colle-
giate activities and the members help to
inspire others to strive for conspicuous
attainments along similar lines. It brings
together members of the faculty and
student leaders for discussion of cam-
pus problems.

Officers of the Council for the ‘com-
ing convention are as follows: Dean W.
L. Sanders, Ohio Wesleyan University,
national president; Dr. Guy EF. Snavely,
Birmingham - Southern College,  vice-
president; F. L. Jackson, Davidson Col-
lege; F. W. Shepardson, New York;
and R. W. Bishop, University of Cincin-
nati.

K. D. Weeks was elected as an al-
ternate to represent the Delta Circle but
was unable to attend the group meet-
ing.

making. Aluminum is being used in
construction of the new two hundred-
inch reflector for the Mount Wilson
Observatory,

For some time it has been known that
a quartz tube will carry illumination
around corners and for great distances
with little loss. Dr. Silyerman stated
that the dreams of the day tubes made
of this material will extend from the
equator to polar regions, conducting
tropic light and heat to the inhabitants
of less temperate zones. Although he
conceded that this conjecture belonged
more properly to. the realms of fancy,
he cited, as examples of scientific possi-
bilities, a number of the commonplace
realities of today which were regarded
as nothing short of fantastic a quarter
of a century ago.

Speaking on “The Cosmic Ray,” Dr.
Compton announced several interesting
conclusions drawn from his research on
this subject.
nitely concluded that the ray on strik-
ing the surface of the earth, or even in
the stratosphere, is corpuscular in na-
ture,

This would completely refute the ex-
panding universe theory of its origin,
advanced by Le Maitre. The speaker
however, stated he was anxiously await-
ing the report of the Byrd Antarctic
Expedition before going further.

The University of Chicago will offer
a course on the “Cosmic Ray” next sum-
mer. It is believed that this will be the
first institution in the world to offer such
a course.

At the business meeting of the As-
sociation of Physicists, the group decided
to continue its organization, and Dr. H.
G. Hoxton, of the University of Vir-
ginia, was chosen as its first president;
Prof. C. W. Edwards, of Duke Univer-
sity, secretary-treasurer.

Dr. Arthur E. Ruark, of the Univer-
sity of North Carolina, who will speak
here the latter part of next month, was
appointed to represent this state in the

gentlemen should conduct themselves.

Dr. Cunningham stressed the point
that all students should pick their sub-
jects carefully enough so that they
would be fit for their work not only in
the seminary but in after life also, The
languages are probably about the most
important thing to be dealt with.

Dr. Cunningham stated that the stu-
dent considering entering the ministry
should not think of the ministry as just
another profession, such as being a doc-
tor, lawyer, etc. The ministry is to be
approached quite differently, and yet
right much the same motives and char-
acteristics are required for all—to attain
the top. The student thinking of enter-
ing the ministry should first have the
right motive. Then he should consider
himself. If he thinks he is qualified,
then others’ opinion of him is most im-
portant, Some do more good by staying
out of the ministry, Be sure that you
can meet the problems and equally ful-
fill the position of a minister before try-
ing to be one, was a warning note of
Dr. Cunningham.

Questions brought out for one to con-
sider before entering a seminary were:
“Do you do it haphazardly, or with de-
liberate thought? Do you compare the
advantages of different seminaries, or
will you just drift into one of them?
Do you let casual: reputation decide for
you? But perhaps the most important
thing in this is the faculty and its teach-
ing.” ”

After the meeting, Dr. Cunningham
answered any questions which any indi-
viduals wished to ask on seminary life
and courses.

committee which is to complete the work
of organization.

The eight states represented in the
Southeastern Association of Physicists
are: Virginia, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Georgia,’ Florida, Louisiana,
Tennessee, and Kentucky. 0

Alumni Office Covers
Student Attainments

The alumni and publication office of
Davidson, under the supervision of Grier
Martin, is making it a point this year
to cover all activities of students in
Davidson College, particularly student
elections, and to forward a report of

each individual's accomplishments to
their respective. “home town” newspa-
pers.

Scotty McLeod has been assisting

Grier Martin in handling this: news,
sending out stories to local papers about
each student’s honors and participation
in extra-curricular activities. 3

The alumni and publication office feels
that when men participate in campus ac-
tivities, they should receive publicity in
their home paper, and in doing this both
the college and the student will conse-
quently benefit.
