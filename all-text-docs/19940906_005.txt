Davidson's own subway system

Full court press

1h

A motion has been proposed to the SGA that the tennis court parking lot be
changed into an outdoor basketball court for student use. While we appreciate the
efforts of those advocating the extra courts, we cannot see sacrificing already-
scarce student parking spots for this kind of facility.

Residents of the dormitories up the hill will be greatly inconvenienced if they
are required to park in satellite or Baker lots more often. Most importantly, women
will have to make more long, risky walks from distant lots along poorly- -lit
walkways.

Keeping in mind that we already have courts beside Richardson field, that
Baker hours were extended last year to accomodate student interests, and that
Johnston Gym would be another logical option for would-be basketball players,
we urge students to tell their SGA representatives to vote oo this motion at
tonight’s meeting. .

Support the Fall Festival

We would like to encourage everyone to support the SGA’s Fall Festival
scheduled to take place Friday, September 9 and Saturday, September 10. For
more than a year, this publication has advocated a campus-wide event designed to
bring together different student groups and faculty members i in a situation oustide
the classroom.

We commend the SGA for answering the campus’ need for such a function.
The events they have planned, which include a student-faculty mixer, the freshman
regatta, and Day at the Lake, promise to make for a big step toward a more unified
Davidson.

But only if we support their efforts. Everyone, especially the faculty, need
only attend and enjoy the events this weekend in order to promote the kind of close-
knit environment we all want to foster here at Davidson College. Considering
those who have put in their time and effort to make the festival possible, it’s a small
thing to ask.

To the editors,

As we pulled up to the
quaint collegiate campus
and a small knot began to
form in my stomach, I real-
ized that I was entering a
Strange new place. The

plorer drew, the larger the
knot became, until finally it
felt as if it filled everything
between my waist and my
chin. Davidson was a col-
lege, and this mass of build-
ings before me was its cam-
pus.

Being a person whobe-
comes easily disoriented, I
began to panic atthe thought
of having to find my way
around a college campus,
even one of such small size.
However, the next day my
fears were quelled upon
learning that Davidson Col-
lege has its own mass tran-
sit system. Whew, what a
relief! Instead of just wan-
dering around the campus,
I discovered that I could
probably make use of the
subway system.

I find it odd that no one
during orientation men-
tioned the subway, but I
managed to discover it on
my own. While walking
between the library and the

‘| Union, I saw large amounts

of steam billowing out from

closer our overloaded Ex- |

beneath a manhole cover. I
happened to ask an upper-
classman about it and he
laughed, “Ahh, you must be
afreshman! Don’t you know
that Davidson has a sub-
way?”

Having visited many
large cities and riding the
N.Y..subway, the Paris
Metro, and the MetroinD.C.,
linstantly knew exactly what

che was eluding to: an under-

ground train, of course. I
must admit, though, that it
did take a second of ponder-
ing due to the lack ofahome-
less wino lying on top.
Recently, I began in-
quiring as to the whereabouts
of the stairs to descend un-
derground. Some, like my-
self at first, had no idea that
Davidson was fortunate
enough to have a stop on
campus. Perhaps signs or
handouts should be printed
so that the student popula-
tion still in the dark can make
better use of this expensive
investment of the city and
the college’s money.
_ -Myhallcounselor, how-
ever, was very helpful when
I questioned him about the
subway’s entrance and cost
of the necessary tokens to
ride. Caught off-guard at
first, he didn’t seem to know
what I was talking about, yet

a little later in the day he
kindly stopped by to impart
the needed information.
Happily, he offered to take
care of setting up a Mass
Transit Account on my stu-
dent ID. if I gave him the
initial $10 start up fee and
$40 year-round fare. I’m
very excited to ride on the
subway, though unfortu-
nately my helpful hall coun-
selor could not remember
just exactly where the Will-
iam Edwards Memorial Sta-
tion is located. It seems that
he never makes use of the
advantages that an on-cam-

’ pus subway system provides.

Anyway, ]’mwriting on
behalf of all the clueless stu-

‘dents who still don’t know

about this great subway. I
definitely feel that signs
should be posted to inform
us of the location of the en-
trance and costs of riding.
Maps of all the stops that the

- line will make might also be

a good idea.

I would also like to
thank the upperclassmen
who, though somewhat in-
timidating at times, are al-
ways willing to help a lost
freshman without com-
pletely humiliating him in
the process.

Sincerely,

Paul N. Ebner, ’98

"thanks"

To the editors,

Although the emotions
and passion of the men’s
basketball season have
‘faded, we have flashbacks
that we will cherish forever.

painted faces and the bare
chests as well as the artfully
crafted signs. We can also
clearly hear the carefully
orchestrated cheers and
shouts of encouragement
and inspiration that were
with us from the opening
tap in November to the fi-
nal seconds of March.

The greatest joy of suc-

We can vividly see the’

cess is being able to share it
with others. For us, you
became the perfect partners
in the wonderful experience
of this season. The primary
reason for our success goes

far beyond the bounds of the -
basketball court, and can be ©

found in three words: that
our team used as the founda-
tion for all of our efforts:
committment, trust, and care.

We were committed to
doing out best; we were able
to be trusted to do our best;
we cared about each other
and we showed it. When
you think aboutit, these three

words are also the founda-
tion for what we are all about
as acollege community. It’s
a simple message and one
that can be found in the Ko-
ran, the Talmud, the Bible,
orany other book that speaks
to and about the virtues and
lifestyle embodied by holy
individuals such as Jesus.
Youhave become area-
son and a purpose for our
ongoing quest for excel-
lence. Thanks for your sup-
port and inspiration.
Sincerely,
The Men’s Basketball
Team
