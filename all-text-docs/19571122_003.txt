Several weeks ago this column directed its attention
to one half of Davidson’s most potent offensive grid
weapon of the season. Quarterback Charlie Benson, who
currently ranks second in the Southern Conference in
total offense, was lauded for his sterling play, and the
aerial fireworks he had set off.

Now it seems only just that the other half of the air
weapon be given credit. End Craig Wall, a veteran of
two years in the Wildcat grid wars, has shattered records
of all sorts in the past few games, and now stands su-
preme among conference pass receivers.

New Conference Standards—

By virtue of his records setting performance against
Richmond last Saturday, Wall set new conference stand-
ards in two departments—
most passes received in a
season (he now has 24),
and most scoring passes
received in a season jhe

—_—

now has 6). ;
He has personally set
five new __ individual

school marks, and fig-
ured in a sixth. New rec-
ords which Wall has set
this season are: most
passes caught, single
game: 7 (against Rich-
mond); most yards
‘gained with pass recep-
tions: 145 (against Rich-
mond); most passes
caught, season: 24: most
TD passes caughi, sea-

son: 6; most yards gained on pass receptions, sea-

son: 466.

In addition to these, Wall was on the receiving end

of the longest pass play in modern school records, a
70-yard toss from freshman quarterback Tom Redding,
in the W. Va. Tech game.

WALL

Scoring Pass Record Tied—

Both Benson and Redding have tied the school
record for most scoring passes thrown in a single game.
Benson completed two scoring tosses against Wofford,
and Redding, who has completed 4 passes for three
touchdowns, threw two paydirt pitches against W. Va
Tech. ;

Unless the Furman defense manages to throw Ben-
son for a total offensive loss of at least twenty yards to-
morrow, the sophomore will inscribe a new total of-
fensive mark in the Wildcat log. Previous high mark
was 76} yards accumulated by all-Conference quarter-
back Dick Belton in 1955.

A win over Furman tomorrow would not only break
a seven-game win streak the Purple Hurricane has
against Davidson, but would also enable the ‘Cats to
finish the season with a 6-2 mark, their best record since
1926, when they won 7, lost 2, and tied 1. In 1933 Da-
vidson was 6-2-1, and, under coach Dole, compiled a
6-3 mark in 1954.

e

With Thanksgiving just a quick kick away, it seems
appropriate to stop and see just what various ones of
us have to be thankful for.

Coach Bill Dole: the Wofford win, his greatest in
six years at the helm of the good ship Wildcat.

Ross Smyth: that he doesn’t have a press interview
every week.

Coach J. W. McCutchan: Claude Finney, who seems
to have quite adequately filled the shoes of the departed
goalie Freddie Butler.

The Davidson Gentleman: his Homecoming date.

The Homecoming date: her gracious host.

The Davidson Administration: Cop Linker.

The football team: a leader like Bill Price, whom
coach Dole terms “the best captain I have ever had.

Campus music fans: the installation of the loud-
speaker system atop Chambers.

Soccer team: the flu bug, who somewhat indirectly
has thrust them into the Homecoming sports limelight.

Gym Shorts—

Due to a lot of interest on the part of students in
using the trampoline in the gym, coach Scott has an-
nounced that he would like to organize a Trampoline
Club, with the better students of the bounce taking
charge. Anyone interested is urged to come by the ath-
letic office and leave their name—the athletic depart-
ment will take it from there . . . The State Physical Edu-
cation Association will meet during the first week of
December at Wake Forest College. The session will be
devoted entirely to swimming. with a panel! discussion,
and a demonstration by swimmers from Woman's Col-
lege, Wake Forest, and Myers Park_high school. Coach
Scott will be attending, as chairman of the Men's Ath-
letic Section... Look for the new Winter Sports Calen-
dars at. various places around town in the next few
days . . . Coming next issue: a critical look at the inter-
fraternity athletic program — is. it a monarchy under

Davidson College's -soccer eleven rolls into action

Saturday afternoon on the local scene in an effort to '
avenge an earlier loss, pick up its fourth win in the final’ >
game of the season and put on a good display for an

anticipated large dance weekend crowd.

Having rested a full week on
the merits of having beaten
Pfieffer tast Saturday, 3-0, the
Red and Black will be at full
strength with the exception of

Dave and Ed Irvin who will be|

out with injuries.

It was these same injuries
that caused
changes in last
week's line-up
and will prompt
some __unortho-
dox action from
coach J. W. Me-
Cutchen tomor-

fort

Herman Carlos

McCutchen who scored all

four of his team’s goals in its |.

4-2 win over the locals.
McCutchen stated = that
secondly to stepping the
high scoring Carlos will be
to get more punch into his
own offense. He will employ
some new tactics concocted
: in connection with assistant
| coach P. A. Marrotte.

A schedule of only nine games

prevents McCutchen secing his
{goal of a .500 season being
,feached on the basis of having
| lost five games, But he pointed
:out that as compared to six
‘games last year, this year’s team
'has scored 10 more goals and
has allowed an equal number,
‘18. although having played two
more games.

Seniors who will see action for
the last time tomorrow will be

Smyth. Pete Ramm. and Ed

Cagers Aim For
First Tilt, Dec. 2

With four games slated for
the first week in December,
coach Tom Scott's basketballers
are rapidly completing prepara-
tions for the 1957-58 cage cam-
paign.

Due primarily to added ex-
perience, all indications point
to a stronger team than that of
last year, which compiled a
7-22 mark.

From the first five of last
season, only captain Richard
Weeks was lost, and coach Scott
feels he has an adequate re-
placement in 6’ 2” sophomore
John Huie, who will fill Weeks’
vacancy ‘at guard.

The hoop mentor looks
to Semi Mintz, last year’s
leading point producer to
be this year’s “general” and
“back court traffic direc-
tor.” The slender junior
was 17th in the nation in
field goal percentage last
season, and nailed down s
second team al!-Conference
berth.
Other guards who will be

pushing for a first team slot are
an improved Sonny Ferguson,
and Mike Martin, who has been
switched from a forward posi-
tion. In addition to these two
seniors, freshman Hight Red-
mond, from Morganton, is
scheduled for plenty of action.

The pivot post should fall to
either Joe Milner, 6’ 6” two-year
letterman, or Eddie Stewart, a
6’ 3” sophomore whom Scott
classifies as equivalent to a 6’ 6”
man under the boards.

Dave Hollingsworth, runner-
up to Mintz in the scoring col-
umn last season, will fill one
of the forward positions, with
senior Lew Spears his probable
running mate.

Spears has improved ‘“‘tre-
mendously,” according to Scott.
especially in the scoring depart-
ment, where the Wildcats suf-
fered last season at the foward
posts. Both Hollingsworth and
Spears have developed deadly
shots from the outside. Fresh-
man Bilt Shinn. an excellent
shooter from Raleigh, will be
used regularly to spell the
starters.

Benson Battles Baker

By BILL HELLIER
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Gunning for a big win in their first away-from-home
Homecoming game. the Davidson Wildcats, fresh from
three consecutive victories, meet Furman tonight in
Greenville for their last game of the season.

A win over Furman, who has
not lost to Davidson in the last
seven years, would climax. one
of the best seasons the ‘Cats
have ever had. Even though the
