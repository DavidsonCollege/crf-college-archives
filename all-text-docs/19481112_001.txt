Campus Club Moves
As Eu Hall Acquired

By NAT DANIEL

The Campus Club, which, since
its organization in 1947, has occn-
pied a room in the Carolina Inn, has
secured a larger and more suitable
location in the first floor of the Eu
menean Literary Society Hall. This
move became necessary due to the
rapid increase in the membership
of the club, and because the facul-
ties in its old headquarters were so
limited.

Early in the school year it was
brought to the attention of the
club that this space was available if
immediate action was taken, A com-
mittee composed of Herb Meza, Joe
McConnell, and Ernie Stricklin was
instructed to investigate the possi-
bilities of occupying the building.

Finally, at the regular meeting on
the night of November 4th, the
committee reported that it had been
successful, The move was undertak-
en immediately after the meeting
adjourned.

The interior of the new Campus,
Club has recently been redecorated
and refinished. It consists of two
rooms, a hall, and lgvatories for
both men and women. The front
room is being used as a lounge and
the rear room is. to be renovated
into a game and recreation room
with a barefor serving cold drinks

and-other refreshments. .
Wheather Report
The weather this week-end for

Davidson and vicinity will continue
fine in every respect with comfort-
able afternoons and crisp, cool
nights. Incidentally, the moon will
be beautiful and unobscured Satuyr-
day night! Sunday will be somewhat
colder, with a rather brisk N. W.
ssind. Temperatures, will range be-
tween 35 degrees and 60 degrees,
Saturday, and from near freezing to
the mid-fifties on Sunday.

Seaver!
