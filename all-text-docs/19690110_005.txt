The Truth of the Matter

Besides the St. Joseph‘s game and the St. John’s game
which I watched with mixed emotions, we also played
and won five games over the holidays. Although you
probably read the scores, or possibly heard the play
by-play on the radio, or maybe even saw the games,
there are a few stories behind the victories.

Saturday, after everyone left the campus and park-
ing places could be found again, we practiced for our
game with Richmond on Dec. 17. Having no studies
or other distractions we were truly like ‘‘a profes-
sional team” as Lefty told us. Driving to the airport
for our flight to Richmond, the athletic department
station wagon, in which Lefty, ex-president Grier
Martin, Mike Maloy, and trainer Tom Couch were
riding, broke down on Interstate 85. A service station
pickup truck stopped and drove the four to the air-
port. Having room for only two in the cab, Mike and
Grier Martin rode up front while Lefty and Coach
Couch huddled in the back. And who says Lefty
doesn’t treat his players right? We played Tuesday
night in Richmond. For those of you who have never
been inside the Richmond Arena it looks exactly like
a bus depot (which it was before they decided to play
basketball there). A maze of yellow-white curtains
hang from the ceiling, and have no apparent purpose
except to hide the cracked rafters. The wooden floor
which people roller-skate on during the week, sits
directly on a concrete base. This makes it seem like
you're jumping from an asphalt street. Other than
these things and the cubby-hole they give you for a
locker room, it’s pretty nice. Incidently, we won by
two points as the Spider’s Picot Frazer missed a
shot at the buzzer.

The following Saturday night, it seemed like every
loud-mouth South Carolinian in the state found their
way into the Charlotte Coliseum for our game with
the Gamecocks. They won the noise contest but we
won the game and the fight. With less than a minute
left in the tight game Cook was jumped by the entire
Gamecock bench in their corner.

Led by Huckel and Kirley, the skins sprinted down
the court faster than we ever had in practice. Special
honors go to tough Tony Orsbon who stood off the
South Carolina skins while I crawled away after having
slipped on some ice and skidded into the melee on my
back. Kirley was in his element and settled things
quickly by choosing the biggest player he could find
and backing him out into the: middle of the court.

The coaches finally got everyone separated with the
aid of the police, The rest of the game was played
out without further incident and after the game a
writer told me it was the best fight he had seen in the
Coliseum. it certainly wasn’t one of the best games.

After four days of vacation we returned Christmas
day for practice that evening. With Texas, Maryland,
and Wichita State in the Charlotte Invitational Tourna-
ment, we were easily favored. Someone suggested
dropping one of those three teams and adding David-
son’s skin team for a better final game, Anyway
Davidson blitzed the tourney with Maloy taking the
MVP award easily.

We returned to the campus on Sunday which was
now exclusively occupied by janitors, stray dogs, and
Burns Detective Agency rent-a-cops. If you think the
campus is quiet when school is in session you should
visit during a vacation. Then again maybe you should-
n't.

Monday we flew to Detroit for our game New Year's
Eve with the University of Michigan. While we chang-
ed airplanes in Cleveland, Jan Postma watched the
scenery, which happened to be a girl in the shortest
mini-skirt possible. Arriving in Detroit we drove to
Ann Arbor where Coach Couch got lost for a half
hour. At least we saw most of the campus.

The next night Cook brake out of his three game
slump and scored 29 points in leading Davidson to a
victory over Michigan in their new field house. This
“house that Cazzie (Russell) built” is really nice. Each
of the 15,000 seats in the place were soft auditorium-
type chairs in the circular domed building. Even the
bench chairs were comfortable.

New Year's Eve at 10 below is an experience, es-
pecially in a town you know nothing about. The stu-
dents at Michigan were still on vacation so there wasn’t
very much happening. Despite this everyone found
something to do. The coaches went to Detroit where
I guess the action was. We all knew we were supposed
to get up at 7:15 the next morning for our flight home
but apparently the coaches forgot or something hap-
mena ause we were not awakened until noon. We
caught a direct flight at 5 p.m. after some courageous
dri on the Interstate into Detroit and arrived in
Charlotte that night.

As for the St. John’s , I prefer to forget night-
mares. Too much has already been written and said
about the last minute of the overtime so I won’t be
redundant. Still it’s really ironic that referree Otis
Allmond had to be the one to call the “five seconds”
on Moser. Allmond also called Fred Hetzel for 1
tending a last second West Virginia shot which looked
like a pass in the 1963-64 season. It also cost Davidson

a victory.

The St. Joseph‘s zoo parade came to otwn Tuesday
night and left intimidated by Maloy’s shot blocking
aerial show. When recruiting, the Hawk’s coach
must have been confused about the difference between
football and basketball — They had more mus-
cle than can be found on certain college football
teams. If a fight had started, the only ice I could have
spent on would have been in the Coliseum parking

Spencer Asks Study

Of Ticket Situation

By RUSS MERRITT
Sports Writer

A number of disgruntled
students, angry over the tick.
et situation at Davidson bas
ketball games, have set the
athletic department and col
lege administration to re-
evaluating the present ticket
set-up.

The protests came both dur-
ing the holidays and after the
St. John's game last week-
end, and centered around
tickets for all games in gen
eral, and St. John's tickets
in particular.

“T had to break a date be-
cause I couldn't get a date
ticket,’ one student said af-
ter the game. ‘‘Even if I had
wanted to pay the seven dol
lars extra to get two other
tickets. together, I couldn't
because of the sell-out. And
no one wants to wave at his
date from.the other side. of
the court.”

Another student was more
upset. ‘The biggest game of
the year and there weren't
even enough tickets to go
around for students. It seems
that there could be some spe
cial arrangement for stu
dents and their dates."

Criticism has continued to
mount during the past week
in regard to the problem of
tickets, or the lack of them

The controversy began just
prior to the Christmas holi
days when students attempt-

ed to get tickets for the St.
John's game on Jan. 4. Tick-
et office officials told the
students that they could sign
a list and pick up their tick-
ets at the door.

Several students protested

cer and Spencer contacted
the ticket office to attempt
to provide the students with
tickets. Due to his interven
tion, tickets were available

school.

However, no announcement
was made when the students
returned (nor was there any
announcement about method
of ticket pick-up prior to the
holidays), and many students
were unaware that they could
pick up their tickets.

As a result, several  stu-
dents denied. tickets

The Davidson Athletic De

week that sophomore Ricky
Snipes has been offered and
has accepted a football schol-
arship.

Snipes, who just last month
lost his basketball scholar
ship when he dropped off-the
squad, received the transfer
scholarship after details of
the switch were worked out

It was earlier rumored
that Snipes planned to trans
fer from Davidson and play
football at another school.

As a senior in high schoo!
Snipes received ‘over 140
scholarship offers in football,
but decided to accept David-
son's basketball scholarship
instead.

The. 6-7, 215-pound Snipes
averaged 184 points per
game last year on the fresh
man basketball team.

Wildkittens Assume Giant-Killer
Role After Upset Of ACC Teams

By STEVE WILLIAMS
Sports Writer

The Davidson freshman
basketball team ran its rec
ord to 5-0 Tuesday night with
an 84.81 victory over the pre
viously unbeaten South Caro
lina freshmen.

The South Carolina team,
ranked as one of the top
freshman teams in the coun-
try, became victims of a
well-balanced and determin-
ed Davidson squad.

Success, thus far, has been
the result of the combining
of many skills for the Wild-
kittens. The team's scoring
punch has centered around
the shooting of Bryan Adrian
(26.4 points per game) and
Eric Minkin (16.2).

Coach Terry Holland point-
ed out that Adrian “‘is doing
a great job this year. He
still hasn't recovered fully
from an injury suffered at
the beginning of the season.
There's no telling what he
could do at full power."’ His
game high is 30 points
against both Furman and
South Carolina.

Six-eight center Eric Min
kin compliments Adrian's
outside scoring ability. When
the defense tightens up on
the outside shooting, Minkin
takes over and scores from
the inside.

Minkin is leading the team
with 12.8 rebounds per game
and is doing an outstanding
job on defense. Against the
North Carolina State fresh-
men, Minkin humbled their

highly touted center, Paul
Coder.
Against South Carolina

Minkin added 6-10 Tom Riker
to his growing list of fallen
giants. Riker, a first team
AlLAmerican in high school
and one of the top freshman
players in the country, is
said by Charlotte Observer
sports writer Allan Sloan to
draw hushed tones from At-
lantic Coast Conference
coaches. Apparently Minkin
had never heard the name.

Doug Hill is the team's
playmaker, averaging 9.4
points per game. Coach Hol-
lend said that ‘Hill should
score more. He hasn't quite
gotten into the groove yet

with his shooting. He has
been doing a lot of extra
work on the problem and we
expect him to come along as
the season progresses.”

Lester Strong (11.2), the
quickest man on the team,
“thas been doing a great job
on defense and takes up the
rebounding slack.’’ Strong
has been averaging 9.6 re
bounds per game.

Frank Clark rounds out the
team's starters with a 10.5
scoring average. Clark also
adds his talents with Minkin
and Strong in clearing the
boards for the frosh.

When asked about depth,
Holland admitted that it
could be a problem if the
team gets into foul trouble.
He also noted that Gary Sci-
bal has done a good job in
relief, and he expects that
Greg Sikes will do the same.
Sikes was late getting out
for practice because of foot-
ball.

The Wildkittens have pro-
duced two big upsets this
season against North Caro-
lina State and South Caro-

lina. About the State game
Holland said ‘‘we produced
a great team effort with lots
of hustle. The boys took ad-
vantage of their strengths to
overcome State's tremendous
height advantage. They could
have killed us with their
height."

Concerning the South Caro
lina game, he said that ‘'we
had a goed scoring punch
and dominated the game
from the beginning. Minkin
did a great job on Riker.”

South Carolina's only note-
worthy spark came from Bry-
an Adrian's former high
school teammate, Bob Car-
ver, who scored 25 points.

The Wildkittens will chal-
lenge the South Carolina
freshmen again next Tues-
day night in a single contest.
Coach Holland, noting the
scuffles that have marked

man contests with USC, said
“if the team does not re-
ceive plenty of support from
Davidson students, I might
just have to take Steve Kir-
ley along to keep score.”
