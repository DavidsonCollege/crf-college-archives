the rest of the North Carolina
delegation.

On the natiomal. seene, Jonas
pudliciy supported Sen. Gold-
water prior to his nomination
at the Repub.ican Convention.
This does not necessarily mean
that Jonas supports all of Gold-
ewaters platform: or political
concepts.

Should the Repubficans win
control. of Congress, Jonas
would be chairman of one of
the important. subcommittee

Babcock Explains What
Conservatives Expect

By LINDSAY DAVIS
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Giles Randolph Babcock
leveled the guns of Repub-
licanism at the Davidson
Student body and fired sal-
vo after salvo of major is-
sues. Babcock spoke at as-
sembly Monday sponsored
by the Conservative Club in
an address entitled “What
the Conservative Expects.”

Babcock explained his con-
cepts of the pressing questions
of the 1964 election campaign.
The major portion of his ex-
planation involyed attacks on
the policies of the present and
preceding administration.

The speaker put forward two
questions that he felt were
crossing party lines and hit at
the. core of the nation’s philo-
sophy of government.

“Will we,’ he asked, ‘“‘cor-
tinue to enjoy our God-given
freedom? Or will we fall into
the depths of welfarism?”’

He elaborated to say that the
liberals are destroying the sov-
ereignty of the individual by
promising security without re-
sponsibility and guaranteeing
work without skill. In contrast,
Babcock stated that the Re.
publicans believe in a man
“working and not voting for a
living, and = encourage self-
reliance.”

The liberal government, Bab-
cock said, relies upon the gul-
libility of the people for sup-
port of its programs to pro-
mote a better standard of liv-
ing by subsidy fromm the govern-
ment. He declared that such
programs contradict their pur-
pose, because the “all powerful
government cannot produce
wealth, for it must take money
from the people” to finance
them. Production comes from
business, science and techno-

‘Thy brother’s keeper’ is a
Hberal slogan, stated the speak-
er, Saying that it was nothing
but a  ‘‘vote-buying scheme.
Some people expect to work for
a living, others just have to
vote for a living.” Babcock
said.

He quoted an example of
failure of one of the promises
of the Democrats .in the 1960
campaign. which stated that 17

‘million Americans were hung-

ry. and they want to be. fed.
Babcock [ollowed.-ths up by
quoting a liberal promise. dur-
ing this year's Presidential
campaign: 35 million are now
hungry and steps will be taken
to feed them

The speaker's argument was
confined. chiefly td: attacks on
the policies of the present ad
ministration :in domestic. and
foreign affairs. He cited save-
ral examples of ‘“‘poor jadg-
ment and bad management.”

High on his list of antago

nisms was the recent push for
an Anti-Poverty bill, which pro-

posed to spend $1 billion, while °

there are atready 38 d:fferen.
programs, spending a total of
$42 billion in welfare and pub-
Hic help.

He stated that the conser-
vatives are opposed to such
“squandering of tax dollars.”
Babcock noted that overindu!-
gence of small business had
virtua‘ly failed in every re

spect, and that these enter-
prises were rapidy disap
pearing.

The farms are another pro-
blem that Babcock felt should
be solved in another way than
thet which the liberals advo-
cate. He recognized the need
for security for the farmers,
but noted that smail farms re-
ceive only 7 per cent of the
subsidy, while the large farms

~ logy, not from the government, receive the major portion. He

also observed that the number
of farms had decreased from
6.8 to 3.7 million in the last
decade.

Foreign aid, according to
Babcock, is another sore spot
for conservatives. He stated
that immediately following the

Bolshevik revolution in Russia, |

the leaders of the United States
set out to ‘save the world from
Communism.” Since that time.
this country. has spent .over
$150 billion in foreign aid to
accomplish this purpose:. as a
resuit, 31 per cent of the nat-
ions of the world are undet
Communist rule.

As a remedy for these situa-
tions. Babcock offered _ his
choice of a Presidential can-
d:daze, Barry Goldwater. He
po.nted t& Goldwater's ‘‘fresh
approach to campaigning’ and
honesty. Bab-ock brought forth
examples of this honesty: Gold-
ers urging the sale of the
Tennessee Valley Authority
property in a speech in Tennes-
see: his opposition to Medical
Care for the aged in an address
to elderly people in St. Peters-
burg, Fla.: and his rivalry to
the rewarding of the TFX air-
plane contract in Texas in a
talk to @ group of Texans.

FOUR CANDIDATES

The Editor of the Wildcat Handbook for the
year 1965-66 will be elected next Tuesday after
Juniors Allen Webb, Britt Snider, Danny
Boone, and Rocky Walker will be the candidates.
year’s election marks a departure from
the established procedure in that only one of the
candidates in this election is presently a member
of the Handbook staff. In previous years only staff
members ran for this office, but the Student Coun-

one member of the old staff expressed a desire to

in order that planning can get under way for

Week as it contains much vital information con

ALLEN WEBB

1 believe the Wildcat Hand-
book has two notable responsi
bilities—first. to introduec the
freshman to Davidson College.
to afswer ‘his questions before
arsival and te he'n him adjust
to his new environment; and
second, to furnish. useful infor-
mation to the entire student
body.

With these responsibilities in
mind, I feel that the last two
editions of the Handbook have
come closer to fulfilling this
purpose than any published be-
fore them.

Tim Kimrcy, editor of the
1963-64 Handbook, changed the.
handbook’s viewpoint. from the
attitude of the Administration’s
orientating incoming fres:vmen
to that of the present student's
orienting the new. freshmen. 1
believe this approach is super-
ior to any other.

To make this student's pyint
of view a more genuine reflec-
tion of student body cpinion.
I will assign each section to a
different member of.the staff.
I feel also the quality of the
writing should improve with
the diversity.

1 will retain the general for.
mat of last year’s edition and
will continue to list freshmen
room numbers under their
names and pictures. I do be-

lieve, however, that several sec-.

tions can be improved, notably
the ones in athletics and re-
ligion. All editorial comments
will appear in italies. Also 1
want to employ more art work
and replace tne paoiographs v1
some members of the adminis.
tration.

Of course the handbook. will
always be open to improvement.
1 will welcome any suggestions
from the student body for ad-
| ditions or deletions. Also I will
, appreciate criticism eoncerning
‘what was liked and not liked
about last year’s handbook.

| Although it is difficult to be
,creative with something like
the handbook, whose primary
function is to provide informa-
tion, I will concentrate on its
readability.

To emphasize the handbook's
use to upperclassmen as well
as to freshmen, I will put: all
phone numbers, including those
of dormitories at women's col-
leges, in an easy-to-find section
of the handbook. Also I would
like to provide a detachable
calendar of events for this year.

I feel that my experience
with a high school newspaper,
as editor of a high school an-
nual and as a reporter for and
Copy Editor of THE DAVID.
SONIAN qualifies me for this
position.

T will appreciate your sup-
port.

DANNY BOONE

Two years ago a previously
dry and stilted Freshman Hand
book was revitalized with two
purposes in mind: to provide
a realistic and personal intro-
duction to Davidson College for

-the incoming freshmen and to

furnish convenient information
for all! members of the student
body. In my opinion the first
consideration of the 1967 Wild-

cat Handbook is to maintain the.

quality and scope of the previ-
ous two handbooks and at the
same time attempt to improve
them by revision,
and addition.

There are several specific al-
terations that I. as a candidate
for editor, have in mind. First,
clarification of actual Rush pro-
eedure and revision. of ‘‘Rush
‘Hints"’ are needed to clear up
misunderstandings that the

freshmen have encountered. A
particularly weak point has
been the vintage and quality of
freshman pictures. This could
be notably improved by merely
sending a letter informing
freshmen that the pictures they
send will be used in the hand-

book. I plan to continue the
inclusion of freshmen room
numbers.

Another area which needs to
be expanded fs the Extra-Cur-
ricula section. Many students
are completely ignorant of or-
ganizations on campus that
they would be interested in if
oniy they were aware of them,

A final area that needs furth-
er major improvements is the
Athletic section. The student
body deserves a inore realistic
appraisal of the athletic teams
and the prospects for the com-
ing year. Athletic schedules in-
sofar as they have been. com-
pleted at publication, should be
included.

One other aspect of editor,
that of the relationship with
the printer, has often been
overlooked. In the past, a cer-
tain lack of dependability on the
part of the printer has been
encountered, and I will attempt
to remedy those past difficul-
ties or to investigate other pos-
sible publishing houses. One of
the major difficulties was the
problem of securing an accurate
estimate of publishing costs.

From my experience on the
staff as a freshman and as as-
sociate editor last year, I hope
that 1 have gained a broader
understanding of the mechan-
ics of editing. the relationship
with the printer, and of the fi-
nancial aspects in order that I
might publish a more person-
alized Wildeat Handbook that
will be of real use and help
to the Davidson student body.

BRITT SNIDER

To my mind, the Wildcat
Handdook serves three purpos-
£8: to acquaint incoming fresh-
men with campus life. at David.
son, to serve as a guide for up-
perclassmen during rush, and
as a reference for students dur-
ing the year.

In years past, a basic format
has been laid down to accom-
plish these purposes, and. at
present, I can forsee no real
change in this per se. My aim,
as editor, would be toward
quality rather than any whole-
gale change.

One of the best innovations
in the Wildcat Handbook in the
past two years and one which
1 think deserves implementation
in the ‘65 Handbook is the. in-
clusion of various editorial com-
ment by the staff. Such com-
ment, as the advice-to-freshmen
section last year, often . gives
a clearer, more pertinent pic-
ture of campus lite than simply

the inclusion of rules and re-
gulations.

_If the budget permits, 1
would also like to see more
pictures used in the ‘65 Hand-
book. In the past, pictures
which were used have often
meant little, such as the head-
shots of the student council;
while highlights of the year,
such as Homecoming and bas-
ketball, have often lacked pic.
torial expression. Better use
of pictures and, if possible, and
inerease in their number would
be a definite improvement in
next year’s Handbook.

Finally, I also plan, if elect-
ed, to continue the policy of
listing freshmen room numbers
under the individual snapshots.

In conelusion, I must confess
that I have had no previous
experience on the Handbook
staff, but, nevertheless, I am
well acquainted with the print-
ing operation and problems in-
volved in publication, having
worked for my hometown and
high school newspapers for
several years.

I will appreciate your con-
sideration and support.

ROCKY WALKER

The avowed purpose of past
‘Wildcat Handbooks’’ has been

to be an orientation guide for

the incoming freshmen and a
reference \ volume for upper-
classmen. As an aid in orienta-
tion the ‘‘Handbook’’ has been
invaluable. but as reference
material for the upperclasses it
has been lacking in certain
areas.

,The upper classes use the
‘‘Handbook"’ mainly during rush
week. A list of the freshmen
and their roomates, by halls, in-
cluded at the end of the fresh-
men section would be. of great
help during dorm rush. The

inclusion of rushing hours. and.

if possible. the orientation sched-
ule would be useful to upper-
classmen as well as freshmen.

In the area of reference a
compact summary of the stud-
ent body regulations (such as
chapel cut. limits) in addition
to the whole body of rules
would eliminate the need of try-
ing to cut through the mire of
the complete list of regulations.
Again this would aid the fresh-
men too.

Improvements which would be
of aid to the freshmen lie
mainly in the area of social. life
and fraternities. A summary of

Cayce To
Speak On
ESP Work

Hugh Lynn Cayce, nationally
known parapsychologist and
specialist. in extrasensoty per-
ception (ESP), will visit David-
son Wednesday and Thursday.

His first appearance will be
at the Open End program at
10 p.m. on Wednesday and on
Thursday morning he will speak
in assembly on ‘'New Discover-
ies in Probing the Unconscious.”

The son of Edgar Cayce, one
of the twentieth century's most
renowned clairvoyants, Cayce is

-a native of Kentucky and a
graduate of Washington and Lee
‘ University. He now lives .in
| Virginia Beach, Va.. where he
‘is Manager of the Association
for Research and Enlighten-
merit, an organization devoted
studies and experimental
work ‘based on his father’s ac-
‘ tivities and the reports.in which

| they: are recorded.

As a result of his work on
the records of his father’s read-
ings, Cayce has written several
pamphlets and a book entitled
Venture Inward. He has also
lectured at numerous American
colleges and untversities, among
them Harvard, MIT and Stan-
ford.

Cayce claims no clairvoyant
ability himself. but has spent
his life trying to prove as scien-
tifically possible the readings
and predictions his father made.

Edgar Cayce, before his death
in 1945, gained world-wide re-

| cognition for his ability to diag-

nose illnesses and to recom-
mend treatments for people
that he had never seen or heard
before. He could also use his
physic gifts to explain histori-
cal events and to predict future
happenings.

rush chairman would familiar-
ize the freshmen with rush and
make it run more smoothly. A
better Charlotte map, pointing.
out good night spots. such as
The Three Brothers, would be
of more aid than the present
one which locates the Charlotte
PO and NCNB. A clear cut de-
finition of the drinking rule and
the honor offenses printed in
bold type ‘ould perhaps. keep,
many of the class of 1969 with
‘us longer than two months.

These are the improvements
that I feel would be of value to
both the incoming freshmen and
the upperclassmen. I would in-
clude them along with the good
innovatiens of the past and
sound suggestions of others in
the 1966 ‘Wildcat Handbook”’
to make it more useful to the
entire campus.
