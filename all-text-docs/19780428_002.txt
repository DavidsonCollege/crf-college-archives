Davidson students protest nuclear plant

By STEPHEN GOLD
Assistant News Editor

Some Davidson students are
likely to be celebrating May
Day this year behind bars in
South Carolina, but they are
fully aware of their predica-
ment.

Davidson students, through
the efforts of senior Roger
Brown, became interested in the
nuclear energy issue, and are
planning to attend the Barnwell
Rally, a demonstration hosted
by the ‘‘Palmetto Alliance” in
Barnwell, S.C.

The protesters are demanding
the ‘‘conversion (of the Allied
General Nuclear Services
(AGNS) plant to a) non-nuclear
function, or its permanent ‘clo-
sure,”’

A year ago AGNS asked the
government to take over the

reprocessing operations for

economic reasons. The Palmet-
to Alliance feels the public,
which did not have a say in this

decision, should not have to pay
taxpayers’ dollars ($14 million)
for the processing of the contro-
versial commercial plutonium.

Brown has been studying
“energy” at Davidson for two
years now in, the Center for
Special Studies ahd became
interested in nuclear energy.

‘*The information we often
read (about nuclear energy) is
dubious...our country spends
too much on research for nu-
clear energy,” Brown states.

He scheduled an anti-nuclear
plant movie ‘‘Last Resort,’’
several weeks ago, shown in the
College Union to a group of
students with similar interests
to Brown’s. The group held
meetings, listened to a guest
speaker from Duke Power,
toured the McGuire power
plant, and started reading ma-
terial on the pros and cons of
nuclear energy.

“It has been eye-opening for
everyone,” Brown feels. ‘‘Rea-

Public debate: abortion

On Tuesday, May 2, at 7:30 pm in Eu Hall, the Davidson
Debate Team will present a public debate on the issue of
Federal funding for abortion. The affirmative team will
support the following resolution:

Whereas, since abortion entails no destruction of human
life and there are valid personal and societal reasons for
abortion, abortion should be an option open to all pregnant
women regardless of financial status, and;

Whereas, poor women are denied abortions because of the
Hyde amendment and Supreme Court decisions which make
public monies unavailable for abortions, and;

Whereas, it is inconsistent and poor policy for the
government to arbitrarily exclude the medical procedure of
abortion from coverage under its health program;

Be it resolved that the Federal Government should provide
financial assistance to any needy woman who requests an

The debate will include constructive and rebuttal speeches
by the affirmative and negative teams. Cross-examination
will be by the opposing team and the audience. Members of
the audience will serve as judges.

Taking the affirmative will be Carol Loptson and Nancy
Warren and the negative position will be represented by
Lindsay Robertson and Anthony San Filippo. Maria
Patterson will be the moderator. Wine and cheese will be

ding about the beauties of
nuclear plants, and then the
problems—somebody’s got to
be lying.”

Brown says the group deci-
ded to go to the Barnwell Rally,
April 29 to May 1, because
regardless of one’s opinion on
nuclear energy, this particular
plant ‘‘shouldn’t be opened.”
Barnwell is the only available
disposal plant for reprocessing
nuclear industrial waste in the -
country, and plutonium is one
of the main radioactive sub-
stances to be stored there.

The rally, expected to draw
around 1000 people, will begin
with ‘‘non-violent training and
value-sharing sessions,’’ and
will continue through the week-
end with speakers and enter-
tainment.

Then, after delivering a writ-
ten petition of the group’s
demands to the owners, the
protesters will occupy the
AGNS property, until the de-
mands are met, or they are
arrested.

Brown plans to march on the
AGNS plant, as do other Da-
vidson students. But, while

others plan to be arrested,
Brown is not sure of the
effectiveness of this method.

“I feel civil disobedience is
justified as a last resort. It
takes a degree of personal
sacrifice,’’ explains Brown,
mentioning the, criminal record
and $15 to $100 bond.

But perhaps this is the last
resort, Brown admits, after
talking with lawyers and legis-
lators.

“I’m not overly enthused,”
he said. ‘I hope it works out
good. I just hope it does,”’

WDAV Director Don Lovell

' admitted this was a problem.

“It’s an evolutionary process.
You can’t expect that with a
sudden change of power the
students will all become profes-
sionals. We’re hoping that the
public will understand that,” he
stressed.

Lovell is in charge of a
$70,000 fund raising program
for the station.

In a January 20 article print-
ed in The Davidsonian, Lovell is
quoted as saying, “We're as-
suming we’ll have raised it all
by May 1.” More than two’

article, Lovell said that the
station was ‘‘halfway there’ in
meeting their goal.

Yesterday morning, only five
days away from the original
goal, he said, ‘‘Fund-raising,
I’m finding, is an on-going
proposition.’’ Lovell admitted
that he has only been able to
raise slightly more than half of
what had originally been pro-
jected and refused to estimate
exactly where they are now.

The financial doldrums don't
bother Roberts. ‘‘It would be
nice if we had all the money in
hand now, but I’m not con-
cerned about it,” she said.

“It’s amazing that we've
gotten as much money as we
have,” said Wilson. She pointed
out that people were asked to
donate money to the radio
before it ever went on the air at
high power.

She is still optimistic. “Every
