Thinclads Take Fourth
In Conference T. ourney

By CHARLIE TERRELL

The Southern Conference
indoor track championships
were held on March 6 in
Lexington, Virginia, and the
Wildcat runners produced a
surprising fourth place fin-
ish.

Perennially powerful Wil-
liam and Mary swept: the
team honors, followed in or-
der by East Carolina, Fur-
man, Davidson, The Citadel,

Richmond, and the host
school VMI.
Two Wildcats notched in-

dividual championships. Jun-
jor Tommy Richardson took
first place in the 60-yard
dash with a time of 6.4 sec-
onds, only .2 off the confer-
ence indoor record. Richard-
son also placed second in the
220. yard dash.

Junior Ray Swetenburg was
the hard-luck performer of
the meet. He took first place
in the 60-yard high hurdles
with a time of 7.4 seconds, a
mere .1 second shy of the
conference mark.

Swetenburg’s performance
was good enough to qualify
him for the NCAA competi-
tion a week later, but he was
. ineligible to participate in

the event,

Coach ‘Whittle explained
that the deadline for entries
in the NCAA expired the
week before the conference
meet. He did not anticipate
that anyohe from Davidson
would qualify and did not
send any names as entries.

Swetenburg's qualifying for
the nationals led Coach Whit-
tle to request permission
from the ‘NCAA board to.al-
low Swetenburg to compete,
but his appeal was turned
down by the committee.

Swetenburg completed an
outstanding performance by
placing second in the triple
jump.

Commenting on prospects
for the upcoming outdoor
season, Whittle is hoping for
a finish comparable to the
indoor team.

Whittle is expecting strong
performances this spring
from the field events, par-
ticularly the shotput and. dis-
cus throw.

Another event in which the
‘Cats are expected to excel
is the triple jump, where
Swetenburg, Tom Rogers and
Lester Abberger provide tal-
ent and depth.

Richardson will receive a

in Conference play, but Da-
vidson is heavily favored’ to
repeat as conference champ.

Fogleman said that he rat-
ed. his team ‘‘on about the
same level as UNC,” one of
the best teams in the coun-

top six players as ‘Bobby
Koury, David Weaver, Jeff

Dumansky, Hy Lankanau,
