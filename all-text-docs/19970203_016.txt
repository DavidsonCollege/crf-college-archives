Wildcats fall just ; short of Herd

By Aaron DUNHAM
Staff Writer

After an upset loss to East Tenn.
St. last Saturday, things did not get
any easier for the women’s basket-
ball team on their northern road
swing.

The Wildcats ventured into
Huntington, W.Va., last Monday to
take on a Marshall squad that was
picked tops in

“| theconference
preseason
coaches’ poll.
Though they played much better
than in recent league losses to Ga.
Southern and ETSU, they still came
up short, falling to the Thundering
Herd, 81-73.

Davidson got off to a good
start, something it had not been able
to do in two previous conference
defeats. The Wildcats made seven
of their first nine shots to take an
early 15-6 lead before the Herd an-
swered with a 9-0 run to tie the
game.

The game then went back and
forth for much of the first half, but
Marshall claimed a five-point half-
time lead.

The second half was also up-
and-down, as Davidson took the
lead twice early in the half and tied
the game at 63 on a Carolyn Kirsch
layup.

Jamie Brown refused to let her
team go down quietly, twice nailing
clutch three-pointers to cut the
Marshall lead to two.

Davidson, however, could not
get any closer, converting only 43%
of its free throws (6-for-14 for the
game, and just 4-for-10 in the sec-
ond half).

Both teams were paced by bal-
anced scoring attacks. Kristina
Behnfeldt, last year’s league fresh-
man-of-the-year, notched a game-

ings to lead the team with 16 points
and 11 boards.

Appalachian St., Brevard Col-
lege, Campbell, East Tennessee
State, Emory, The Citadel, UNCA,
UNCC, and Winthrop faced off
against the Davidson men’s and
women’s track teams at Asheville
on Saturday, and Wildcat athletes
performed well againstthe stiff com-
petition.

The final team standings have
not been calculated, but Davidson
had a number of top ten finishes.

For the men, Roland Williams
posted fifth place (4.88) in the 40-
yard dash, and teammate Steve
Hsieh followed with eighth. Will-
iams paced the Wildcats in the 300
(41.02, third). Dan Dearing and
Andy Vanica were right behind him
with fifth and eighth, respectively.

In the 500 meters, Addam
Marcotte led Davidson (1:21.1).
Ken Howard grabbed tenth in the
800 meters (2:12.45). In the mile,

cats, finishing in 4:59.59, and Keith
Gordon had Davidson’s top finish
in the 3000 (9:44.06).

Davidson’s two 4x400 relay
teams claimed sixth and seventh
place. Mike Albert, Dearing, Will-
iams, and Marcotte composed the
first team, and the second was Steve
Hsieh, Stan Baker, McElveen, and
Dave Slenzak. Eugene Jung com-
peted in the shot put.

For the women (times N/A),
Jamilah Sawyer sprinted and leaped
to a tie for first place in the hurdles,
the Wildcats’ lone win. Teammate
Schaap Freeman finished third.
Also, Laura Burkholder took fourth
in the 40-yard dash.

“We had a pretty good meet,”
Jonahthan Fly said afterwards. “The
track was a little slow and it was the
first meet of the season for many
people, but we did well.”

Women’s coach Beth Puckett
said that they had a good meet over-
all and coped well with the tough
conditions of UNCA’s track, which
was a short 160 meters.

We should be officially

against the rules.

Kamp, who replaced Jennie
Vanlerberghe in the starting lineup,
had her second consecutive solid
performance, tallying 16 points and
7 rebounds. Brown and Jen O’
Brien added 14 and 13 points, re-
spectively.

VMI win from page 13

started to play on our heels,” said
McKillop. “But we didn’t. To be
able to answer the bell when they
make a run is key.”

Davidson scored the next four
points to widen the lead to 56-51.
Chadd Holmes, who scored 14, took
a pass from Ali Ton and slammed it
home at the 5:47 mark to give the
Wildcats a decisive 63-54 lead. That
would seal it for Davidson, as from
then on, the the Keydets were un-
able to get any closer than six.

The loss for VMI snapped a

‘four-game winning streak, their last

victory coming Monday over North
Division leader Marshall. The
Keydets are now 5-2 since the sus-
pensions of Andre Quarles and Brent
Conley, last year’s Southern Con-
ference Freshman-of-the- Year.
“We’ve been having to pick it
up, play as a team a little bit more,
not just relying on one person,” said
VMI coach Bart Bellairs. “When
you go through adversity, you have
to get stronger as a team, and that’s

what we’ ve done.”

Men’s basketball lands
two prize recruits

By MICHAEL KRUSE
Sports Editor

The men’s basketball team has
landed a pair of recruits for next

season that should help the Wild- _

cats again dominate the Southern
Conference as they did last year.

Brian Allenspach, a 6-10 cen-
ter from Stoneman Douglas High in
Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., and Emeka
Erege, a 6-4 swingman from Long
Island (N. Y.) Luthern High School,
were officially accepted to school
on Wednesday.

“These are two very talented
student-athletes and classy young
men,” said coach Bob McKillop in
a press release. “They are valuable
additions to our program. They will
improve us athletically and they
will be positve additions to our stu-
dent body and the Davidson com-

munity.”

Allenspach averages 15 points
and 11 rebounds at Stoneman Dou-
glas, and has led his team to a 19-5
record and No. | district ranking.

His twin brother, who is 7-0,
has signed to play with Boston Col-
lege next season.

Erege is the Wildcats’ first ad-
dition from Long Island Lutheran
since McKillop (who coached there
before coming to Davidson eight
years ago) snagged Detlef Musch
as his first ever recruit.

Erege, who is from Nigeria and
played in Germany before the U.S.,
scores 14.9 points and grabs 12.2
boards a game for a team that is
currently 13-2 and No. 2 in the
State.

Vassil Evtimov, a freshman
forward at North Carolina, starred
for Lutheran last year.

' Fresh face Mary Shell Brosche is just one of the reasons both the men’s and iwonea'a” ug

swimming and diving teams have a strong chance to win the Southern States tournament
on Feb. 13-15 at Cannon pool. The men knocked off Duke for the first time in Davidson
swimming and diving history in their final tune-up Saturday.
