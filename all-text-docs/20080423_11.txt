By ZACH ZIMMERMAN
Staff Writer

On Friday the Davidson men’s tennis
team concluded its season with a heartbreak-
ing loss in the quarterfinals of the SoCon
tournament against Appalachian State. With
the loss, the team’s final record stands at 14-
8.

Flaviu Simihaian ’08 closed out his career
at Davidson with 43 wins in his four years.
Along with Ethan Jaffee ’09, Simihaian was
selected for the All-SoCon first team.

Davidson started off the day by dropping
all three doubles matches to Appalachian
State, bringing the overall score to 1-0.
Despite the setback, Davidson came back
strong with two wins at No. | and No. 3 sin-
gles by Flaviu Simihaian ’08 and Ethan
Jaffee ’09, respectively.

With Davidson up by a score of 2-1, ASU
secured the third match of the day to tie the
score 2-2. Scott Myers ’09 put Davidson
back on top with a win at No. 6 by a score of
7-5 and 6-3. Myers finished the season as an
All-SoCon second team member and fin-
ished the season at 18-4.

Eric Noble ’10 and Sam Burns 10 found
themselves with early leads in both their
matches but could not close either of them
out in the third set. These defeats secured the
ASU victory by an overall score of 4-3.

Although the team will lose Simihaian
and Compeau next year, Davidson will
return a vast majority of its roster next sea-
son hungry to win the SoCon
Championship.
