"ie Campus Forum On The SGA Election

_ Jackson
Attacked
To the Editor:

_ In all sincerity, we would like
to congratulate David Waddill
upon his election as S.G.A
President, and to thank Robert
Bowie for his stand in favor of
change and against the status
quo. We also are very pleased
with the stimulus to thought
and, hopefully, action provided
by the debate in the campaign;
and, therefore, we commend the
three candidates and those who
supported them for their parti-
cipation. However, we are deep-
ly concerned about certain irre-
gularities and indiscretions
which marred this past week of
campaigning and the elections
themselves.

First of all, we condemn the
unauthorized reporting of var-
ious endorsements by the Bowie
Committee. We are sympathe-
’ tic with their well-meaning in-

tentions, but we urge the exer-

cise of greater care in the future,

We also hope that apologies

have been (or quickly will be)

made to the harmed persons.
We also resent the behavior
of former S.G.A. President

John Jackson's position harass-

ing an individual candidate ii

any election held upon this

is no.exception. Jackson severe-
office of S.G.A President with
his referrals to Bowie as a
“dick.” He displayed an amaz-
der-—even though the Bowie
literature did not mention Jack-
son. He demonstrated his
wealth of legal knowledge by
yelling slander in response to a
written act. Jackson further
destroyed his own credibility by
threatening to ‘‘embarass (Ro-
bert) in front of the whole
school.”

We understand that Jackson
may have felt personally
harmed by the many references
to alleged inadequacies of the
SGA. However, such personal
feelings cannot justify the dis-
respect Jackson showed toward
Bowie while serving as the
representative of the Davidson
College Student Body. We are
extremely disappointed that
Jackson exhibited such a lack of
character and restraint. In an
environment which continually
‘stresses ‘‘honor” and ‘‘Christ-
ian commitment,’’ Jackson's

* elections has been considerably

reduced. We-hope that reform is
forthcoming (next election
Tuesday, April 1), and we
wonder if explanations might be
in order.

All in all, this past week
demonstrated a cavalier atti-
tude toward the SGA on the
part of the entire college com-
munity. The SGA does not take
its own elections seriously. The

t SGA President minimized
Ris commitment to the SGA to
the point that personal feelings
take priority. The Bowie people
have maintained from the be-
ginning that the SGA is a farce.
If this attitude is truly charac-
teristic, perhaps, the SGA
should be disbanded. If it is not
characteristic, then it is time for
each and everyone of us to insist
upon quality programs from the
SGA, quality representation
from our elected officials and
quality candidates to populate
our elections.

Jackson's
Positi

To the Editor:

I am writing about the recent
SGA Presidential campaign of
Mr. Robert Bowie. Most of the
SGA Senate’s past performance
this was due to complete ignor-
ance or intentional lying I don’t
know. In any case, there is no
excuse for anyone to say the
things that he said about the
SGA and the other two candi-
dates.

Please understand that I
certainly realize the Senate isn’t
above criticism. and scrutiny,
and I welcome legitimate com-
plaints as a constructive way to
improve the SGA’s efforts.
However, Mr. Bowie was com-,
pletely uninformed about what
the SGA had been doing in the
past years. I asked him to
discuss his platform with me
last Monday night and found
that his only source of informa-
tion about Senate activites was

_ The Davidsonian. Bowie had
not read any of the Senate
minutes and he had not asked
for information from any of the
current SGA Senators or offi-
cers. No wonder Bowie, Brave
Speaker of Truth, knew very

of the truth
he dis:

. ..”" Phis is not true at

-all—the referendum did con-

demn the Trustees’ action, but
so did Bowie. The cause for
his misinterpretation was soon
apparent, and not surprising:
Bowie had not read the referen-
dum since it was held two years
ago, and had based his opinion
on the wording as he ‘‘recalled”’
it. Further discussion revealed
other interesting facts: Bowie
did not realize that the Senate
had already passed a resolution
calling for higher faculty sal-
aries (which was passed 19 days
before President Spencer’s re-
commendation of the same);
Bowie did not realize that the

FIJI's

Trustees were already commit-
ted to an average enrollment of
1300 (so why pass a resolution
demanding what we already
have?); Bowie did not under-
stand what the SGA recruit-

‘ment weekend was until I

explained it to him. Then, he
called the weekend ineffective—
that is, until I told him of the
impressive recruitment results
the weekend had yielded last
year. Bowie finally dismissed
SGA Weekend as unimportant.
Curious.

We discussed several other
issues, and the results were the
same: Bowie simply did not
know what he was talking
about—he seemed a perfect
answer to the question he asked
in his campaign: “‘What experi-
ence does inaction provide?”’ He
still insisted that the SGA had
done nothing and that his
claims were valid. Frustrated, I
challenged him to a public
debate on the topic, which he
immediately declined. Man of
Action?

sorry, Bowie, but there is no
excuse for the way you handled
your campaign. Two of the
people who you said endorsed
your campaign called me Mon-
day afternoon saying that they
were completely unaware that
they had done so!

Well, Mr. Bowie, at least it’s
over. I hope that Davidson will
not be subjected to campaigns
of your sort again, but, since it
is a fashionable way to attract
attention, I suppose that yours
won't be the last. One person
who endorsed you told me that

you took in order to make your
name known after spending
three years in political obscur-
ity. Maybe. In any case, have a
safe and speedy trip back.

Bowie's
Position

To The Editor:

On Monday night, I received
an irate telephone call from Mr.
John Jackson. In an angry
voice, he demanded that I come
down to the KA house and have
it out with him. Although this
was the last night before the
SGA election and thus a busy
one for me as a candidate, I
agreed to meet with Mr. Jack-
son out of respect for his

position as President of the
SGA.

ment to an incoherent mono-
logue in which Mr. Jackson
argued that I had personally
“slandered” him by daring to
question the record of the
SGA. I asked him to find
something factually inaccurate
or maliciously intended in any
of my public statements. Using
expert logic, Jackson responded
that *my criticism of the SGA
weekend as insignificant was
factually inaccurate because the
admissions department said it
was significant. He then an-

Jackson's letter, although the
broad command of the English
language he displayed on Mon-
day evening suggests that his
letter will constitute its own
rebuttal. Jackson challenged
me to public debate on his
allegations and seemed unus-
ually chagrined when I refused
to participate in his political
temper tantrum. With the elec-
tions over, I feel that such an
emotional outburst could only
be divisive and make the SGA
more ineffective than it already

For the remainder of our
unfortunate hour together, Mr.
Jackson painted a portrait of
the SGA as an organization
with many secret meetings and
duties. Mr. Jackson apparently
thinks these decisions in smoke
