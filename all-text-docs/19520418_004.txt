THE DAVIDSONIAN

Phi Gams Win
National Frat
Scholastic Cup

The local chapter of Phi Gamma
Delta received word this past week
that it was the winner of the Fred-
‘erick B. Owen trophy for top
scholarship in its national frater-
nity.

The Owen trophy is awarded an-
nually to the chapter of Phi Gam-
ma Delta that has the highest
scholastic standing in relation to the
other fraternities on its own cam-
pus,

This award was preceded by the
local Belk trophy which was re-
ceived by the Phi Gams recently.

The Davidson chapter ac-
complished an almost miracu-
lous feat in reaching its present
position by climbing from its
rank of SSth for the preceding
year. Immediately below Da-
vidson in standing are Indiana,

Wabash, Hanover, and Rich-

mond in that order.

In relation to other fraternities,
the national fraternity of -Phi Gam-
ma Delta has the following record:
twenty-four chapters had an aver-
age equal to or better than the all-
men’s average; thirty-four chapters
improved their standing for the pre-
vious year.

TWO DEBATORS ...

take part in this tournament to

make it the most representative

of the debate ournamens that

Davidson enters.

Among the teams that the Da-’
vidson team met were the Uni-
versity of New York, Emory Uni-
versity, University of Pittsburg
Ohio Wesleyan, Washburn (Kan-
sas) and Loyola of Baltimore.

Because the negative team
found out a few days before the
trip that they would be unable
to make the tournament, this
usually affirmative team had to
double as a negative team also.
This was a particular handicap

since neither of the debaters had
debated the negative side, and in
one day they were to give six nega-
tive debates.

So far this season the local

UNC Vote Hijinks USAF Interviews

Ring

(Eds Note: As D.C, elec-
tions get into full swing we
note a painfully familiar ring
to the account of voting hi-
jinks at U.N.C. The squib is
from an editorial in the Daily
Tarheel.)

‘Some of the votes were illegiti-
mate: at least two people were al-
lowed to vote with driver's licenses
contrary to the elections laws there
may have been many more; many
women voted at the wrong poll.

One 1949 graduate was chal-
lenged as he tried to vote with a
1949 1.D. card; and one student
bragged that he was voting four
old 1.D. cards of his own.

Plain ordinary ignorance will ac-
count for a certain number of such
incidents, and so many will happen
in every election.

There were also some compul-
sory ‘votes, but presumably these
votes were legal, if irresponsible,
as forced votes must be.

Elections meant little to most
people—a few ‘minutes out of the
day to vote, perhaps casual con-
versation as’ to merits of candi-
dates, a $1 or $5 fine for.a few
fraternity men.

CABBAGE PLANTER

up the Nasty Letter! “Whew,” he
sighed, “that was Close!” And then
he wrote another letter.

This one was shorter, not over a
page and a half, small size paper
and went something like this:
“Dearest Friend, Nobody under-
stands better than I just why you
were unable to make it for the
dance this weekend, and certainly,
if there is anything we need for
world peace, it is understanding
among peoples and nations .. .”

Well, the upshot of it was that he
was just as tender as could be all
the way through, and ended up by
asking her for a date at her col-
lege the next weekend. Not onc
Nasty Remark anywhere. I guess
you and I, who know about Such
Things, can plainly sec. There Was
No Doubt About It. Mervin was a
man.

Then in the sunset's flush they

went aloft,

And unbent sail in that most

lovely hour

When the light gentles and the

wind is soft,

And beauty in the heart breaks

like a flower.

Seniors Hit For

Dough To Bring
Dance Bill Clear

All seniors are having to briefly
loosen their purse strings this weck
and shell out 70 cents to cover a
deficit in ticket sales for the senior
dance held two weeks ago.

Officers were elected for
class day also at the Monday
meeting. President Tom Stock-
ton announced these men who

morning.

Photomen Elect
Heads, Hang Exhibit

_The Photo Club last week elected
new officers and put up a photog-
raphy exhibit in the dining hall in
conjunction with Fine Arts Week.
The exhibit contains both student
and faculty contributions.

The club elected new officers
for the coming year. President
Allan Macy presided over the
meeting which saw Dave Mat-
thews succeed Macy as presi-

purchase an enlarger for use in the
new darkroom located in the Stu-
dent Union.

period. Their physical standards are
the same as for aviation cadet pi-
lot training, except for less stringent
visual requirements.

Major Ferree’s primary mission
will be to interview and give in-
formation to all seniors who may
be interested in this course, (others
will clear through the dean if de-
sirous of an interview), and to ad-
minister the preliminary tests, and
forward results with applications to
the nearest Air Force base.
