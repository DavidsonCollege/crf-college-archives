Davidson ROTC Cadet Corps Responsible
For Displaying School Colors this Year

The Davidson ROTC Cadet Corps
has assumed responsibility for the
display of the college colors dur-
ing the current school year.

Cadet Jim Batten, Sergeant of the
Color Guard, has marched with his
guard at each of Davidson's home
football games which will again
lead the band in tomorrow's Home-
coming ceremonies.

Other members of the Color
Guard include Cadets Charles
Gribble, Robert Jones, and Anthony
Guiles. The Color Guard will march
in the Kannapolis Christmas Pa-
rade later in the year.

A new flag, donated by Dr. Wil-

son Compton of the Council for
Financial Aid to Education, will
be unfurled prior to the Homecom-
ing game tomorrow on Richardson
Field. Cadets William J. Martin
and David Brown will raise the
new flag as “The Star Spangled
Banner” is played.

Third year cadets are responsible
for the raising and lowering. of
the flag on the front of the cam-
pus. This duty is performed daily
by cadets who are detailed by Ca-
det Dan LaFar, regimental ser-
geant major. Two students are as-
signed this duty each week
throughout the school year.

Blue Hose Down

(Continued from Page Three)
low. Score: 9-0. .

The first kick-off of the Second
Quarter was nicely returned to
midfield by McRee. We advanced
into Hose territory but died on
downs. The teams exchanged the
ball three times. Cook was forced
to kick to Rowland who caught the
ball on his own 38, faked a hand
off and raced 35 yards to the Hose
27. But for the fast Hose defender,
Felder Cook, who made the tackle,
Rowland would have scored. Our
drive to the goal was stifled by
penalties, and poor offensive block-
ing for the passes. A sereen pass
to Campbell was well run and
might have scored but Don was
tripped up by a lone defender.
Finally Belton fumbled and the
half ended with the Hose on the
offensive.

Second half play was dominated
by the relentless onslaught of the
hard charging Presbyterians. Their
second touchdown was set up on a
pass interception by Richard Shrig-
ley. The Hose went from the Cat
40 to the goal on passes to Brock-
enbrough and Butler, the latter
scoring partly because of faulty
pass defense by the Cats. (Comer
had to cover two men.) Webb's
extra point try was good. Score:
16-0.

For Davidson Belton and Newton
looked excellent on offense. McRee
also did well. On defense Price def-
initely stood out. Owens also look-
ed good, as did Llewellyn. For Pres-
byterian it was Cook who shined
on both defense and offense. The
Shrigley brothers, Donald Daniels,
and Lee Frierson al] played good
ball in the line for Presbyterian,
The Blue Hose certainly earned
their win.

For October 25

Duplicate Bridge
Tournament Set

The first Duplicate Bridge Tour-
nament ‘sponsored by the Union
Games committee for 1955-56 will
be held in the ballroom on Tuesday.
October 25, at 7:30 p. m.

- J. A.. Pastel will direct and he
will be accompanied by Dr. A. M.

Scripts ‘n Pranks ist |621 Join Davidson ‘Y’;

The editorial staff of Scripts ‘n
Pranks announces that the first is-
sue of this year's college magazine
will be distributed during the last
week in October (this publication
is truly the college magazine, not
merely a student publication—just
as our Union is supposedly a
College Union—it is a vehicle of
expression for the entire college
community).

This issue is entirely devoted to
humor and lighter subjects. Its
original design was to emphasize
the harmless frolic which is Home-
coming. However, the earlier Week-
end this year prevented such an
appropriate publication. In a sense,
it is properly a Homecoming issuc
yet—the official return of humor
to the Davidson campus.

In addition, this issue includes
an announcement of tremendous
importance to those members of
the freshman class who harbor
latent creative ability.

World Affairs Films
To Be Shown by ROTC

It will be of interest to all stu-
dents interested in world affairs to
know that films from the National
War College, shown in the ROTC
department to the Cadre by gov-
ernment order, are now available
to organizations upon request from
Colonel Sapp (thirty days notice
is required).

These films are question and an-
swer discussions conducted by out-
standing military and civilian lead-
ers. The films include such sub-
jects as “What We Face in South-
ern Asia” led by Supreme Court
Justice William O. Douglas, “Red
China and the United Nations” led
by. Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., “Which
Way for the Germans” headed by
General Bedell! Smith, “Soviet Ob-
jectives” conducted by Mr. George
F. Kennan, and others.

These films have been viewed
by several of Dr. Ford’s political
+science classes, and by a few or-
ganizations. The films also may be
seen, if sufficient interest arises,
on the days they are normally seen

jin the ROTC department.

Davidson Survey

(Continued From Page One)
is still on the upgrade, for 93.7%
of the television families encoun-
tered would encourage a person
not owning a television but in-
terested in buying to go ahead and
buy. This trend is further shown
by the fact that 30.4%0 of the fam-
ilies without television plan to
buy a set within the next 12
months.

There has been some question
in recent years as to whether or
not children are disturbed by pro-

The. answer obtained in this study
was negative, for 71.6% of children
in the television families encoun-
tered are seldom disturbed by what
they see or hear on television.
Television advertising received
a choice bit of material for trade-
drumming purposes. The survey in-
dicated that 46% of the televiewers
in this area prefer television ad-
vertising to any other medium, and
that if they were merchants they
would rely mainly on this method.
It was revealed that 64.8% of
the families that take morning
newspaper spend less than 30 min-
utes per day reading their paper,
and that 71.4% of the evening
newspaper readers spend less than

30 minutes. Of the group inter-

viewed 48.6% take no morning
newspaper and 33.5% of the fam-
ilies take no evening newspapers.
World, national, state, and local
news is learned by television by
375% of the respondents.

It was found that 30.7% of all
families have two or more radios
in their home, and that 45.4% of
all families have at least one car

Issue to Appear Soon|New Budget Announced

According to a tabulation made, tacted during the scheduled period

Wednesday afternoon, 621 students,
faculty, and staff members have
joined the Davidson College YMCA
for the school year 1955-56. Of this
total, 573 are student membcrs,
and 48 are faculty and staff mem-
bers. Returns are still incomplete,
since many men could not be con-

for various reasons.

Membership cards are now in the

process of being tabulated accord-

| ing to indicated interests. This will
aid Cabinet members in contacting
those persons who are interested
in working with their post.

Children are seldom disturbed
by radio programs, according to
80.5'% of the persons contacted.

Music is preferred to other
types of listening by 44.1% of the
radio families.

The survey also showed that
WBT and WBTV are the most pop-
ular radio and television stations
in this area.

This is the first of a series |
of twenty-two weekly articles
by the membership of the
Honorary Fraternity Council
which will attempt to explein
the purposes, aims and func-
tions of the various orgeniza-
tions which comprise the Hon-
orary Fraternity Council.

By PROF. F. D0. BENTON

Sigma Pi Sigma holds a rather
unique position among honorary
fraternities at Davidson in that it
had its beginnings on this campus
and that the local chapter is the
mother chapter of the national
society. For a number of years a
need was sensed in the Physics De-
partment of Davidson College for
an organization which would serve
as a means of recognition for su-
perior scholarship in physics, that
would bring those who were par-
ticularly interested in this science
into closer association and would
encourage and stimulate them in
their scientific work, and which
would thereby bring about a
greater cooperation between _in-
structor and student to the benefit
of both.

The hone of this group was real-
ized when at Davidson on Decem-
ber 11, 1921, five students and four
faculty members banded together
to form a group which they
designated Sigma Pi Sigma. Their
first meeting was held at the home
of Dr. J. M. Douglas, head of the
Physics Department. A constitution

was drawn up and adopted and the
design for a key chosen. This or-
ganization, standing high among
similar groups at Davidson, con-
tinued successful operation as a
local honor fraternity. In 1925 a
small group of student members,
under the leadership of Trawick
and Graves, conceived the idea that
the benefits which Davidson was
deriving from the  orgunization
might be shared by others, that by
having many chapters operating as
a unit, an efficient organization in
its service to physics, and one of
enhanced value to its members,
might be developed.

Hence a movement for nationali-
zation was launched, originally in
a rather modest manner. The local
constitution was declared void, a
new national constitution adopted
and national officers and an execu-
tive group elected. Forms for the
Seal, Charter, and Insignia were
suggested by the executive group,
designed by C. M. Brown, and
adopted on April 14, 1925.”

Under the leadership of the first
National Secretary, Professor H. E.
Fulcher, six additional chapters
were installed in the period from
1925 to 1928. The first convention
was held at Davidson in April.
1928, marking the first real con-
sciousness of a national unity. A
continuous expansion into institu-,
tions in all parts of the country
has now made Sigma Pi Sigma truly
national in scope with 88 active
chapters at present. The total
membership of the society now
numbers more than 11,400, of
whom 2,200 are active members of
chapters, the remainder being
classified as alumni members.

Since the chief aim of Sigma Pi
Sigma is to further interest in
science and mathematics, especial-
ly physics, the local chapter has
one or more projects each school
year. Last year it sponsored an ex-
hibit of the inventions of Leonardo
da Vinci, which attracted more
than 188 visitors. In 1953-54 one
of the members, Jim Hogan, con-
structed a piece of apparatus to
demonstrate micro-waves, a project
which received nationwide pub-
licity. This year’s project has not

yet been announced, but a pro-
gram to increase the interest in
science in local high schools is
under consideration. At times dur-
ing the year programs of genera)
interest are held and the student
body is invited to attend. Sigma Pi
Sigma exists not only for the
physics major, but to promote a
better understanding and appre-
ciation of the physical sciences
among the non-science students.

Prof. Lilly

(Continued from Page One)
Florida, sees no serious threat, for
he is pretty sure few students are
silly enough to try the comic book
bypass. Anyway, he says, “students
who read classic comics as an easy
aceess to an assignment ure
doomed to failure on an exam.”

Such treatment of great books, in
the opinion of Leslie A. Fielder,
Montana State University, can
serve no purpose “except that of
discouraging the students from
reading the original and contribut-
ing to the already terrible trend to-
ward giving up literacy complete-
ly.”

In contrast with the easy ap-
proach, thirty professors of litera-
ture from many parts of the nation
have given the editors of the
Going-to-College Handbook lists of
books which they think students
entering college would do well to
have read. A separate poll of stu-
dents indicates books they advise
high school students to read now.
There are notable similarities (and
differences), the editors say. In
addition to a longer list of recom-
mendations, the concensus of the
professors points to the following
for the first twelve:

The Bible, three Shakespeare
plays, Huckleberry Finn, David
Copperfield, Gulliver’s Travels,
The Odyssey,The Iliad, Ivanhoe,.the
King Arthur legend, Alice in Won-
derland, the Scarlet Letter, Frank-
lin's Autobiography.
