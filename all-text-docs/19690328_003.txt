PHILIPPE ENTREMONT
At Fine Arts series Monday nighi.

Entremont Show

‘Fresh, Pleasing’

The Fine Arts series ended
last Monday night on an up-
beat as young French con-
cert pianist Phillipe Entre-
mont brought his highly ac.
claimed tour to an appre-
ciative audience of about 400
in Love Auditorium.

Entremont played selec-
tions from Bach. Mozart,
‘Schumann, Debussy. Proko-
fieff, atways with a fresh
and innovative  interpreta-
ition which the pianist may
some day be able to call his
“own personal style.”

Banging away into the se-
‘cond movement of Schu-
mann's ‘'Etude,’’ Entremont
seemed to be as carried away
with the velocity of the piece
as was the audience.

Given his clear and tech.
nically perfect style, it was
left to his very evident ex-
uberance to render his heavy
classical selections with a
pleasing touch which the
audience could so thoroughly
identify with.

It was his empathy with
his music that sustained the
nerformance from start to
‘finish.

The pieces, starting with
Bach and ending with Proko-
fieff, moved progressively
from the purely intellectual
to the emotional, and finally
to the purely concrete images
of Debussy.

Entremont's career in the
United States has been one
of phenomenal success. It
began in 1953 with back-to-
back concerts in Washington
and Carnegie Hall in New
York.

Since then he has been a
favorite of audiences in six
continents.

More than a million of his
recordings on the Columbia
label have been sold in this
country. His best records are
collaborations with Leonard
Bernstein and the New York
Philharmonic, and Eugene
Ormandy and the Philadel-
phia Orchestra.

Entremont has been award-
ed the Grand Prix du Dis-
que. France's highest award
to an artist. and the Nether-
land's coveted Edison award.

Monday's performance was
his second appearance at
Davidson.

By JULE YOUNG
Staff Writer
According to present plans,
Davidson's student exchange
program is to be renewed

during the spring term.

The program, which sent
several students on a four
day mission to Pennsylvan-
ia’s Haverford College last
year. is intended to help Da-
vidson gather good ideas in
use on other campuses.

students who visited Haver

at American and British in-
stitutions, is a member of
the Department of African
Studies at JCSU.

pledge project should bene-

a whole as well as the frat-
ernity,”’ said Bobby Allen.

the project.

Allen said that the money
for the project was being
provided by the fraternity
and the pledges themselves.
although about $50 is coming
from the College Union Act-
ivities Fund and one dollar
will be’ collected from each
of the 60 persons to partici-

The program is eritireiy

publicity sheets says that
the program is ‘in the spirit
of the Free University.”

A syllabus put out by Dube

Hall Counselors
To Be Retained

By STEVE CROSS
Asst. Managing Editor

The policy of separate
dormitories for freshmen will
continue. according to Mrs.
Peter Nichols, director of
student housing.

Incomplete results of a
survey taken last: month con
vinced her that the old policy
of class segregation was
preferred by students.

“The results were very
slow in coming in,"' said Mrs.
Nichols. ‘‘but we've complet-
ed enough of them to know
that we're going ahead with
the regular hall counselors
plan as usual.”’

Putting upperclassmen in
the freshman dorms would
have made it necessary to
revise the freshman hand.

a form of ‘‘de facto segre-
gation’’ would have existed
anyway, because the students
like some dormitories bet-
ter than others.

Mrs. Nicholls said if more
upperclassmen were to be’
admitted to the freshman
dorms. then signing up for
rooms next year would have
to be manipulated in some
way to make rooms in East,
Cannon and Watts available
to upperclassmen.

Mrs. Nicholls had proposed

CAB Stalls
Youth Fare
Judgment

By CHRIS BICKLEY
Staff Writer

The Civil Aeronautics
Board is currently deciding
the fate of youth air fares.
Pro and con arguments
were presented last week to
the flve member board, “but
when contacted in Washing-
ton. a spokesman for CAB
said that a decision is not
expected for several months.

The current arguments
over youth fares stem from
a suit filed by Trailways
Bus Company and a nation-
al trade organization of bus
operators. In its suit Trail
ways alleges that the dis-
counts given students are
illegal because they discrim-
inate against persons over
22.

Youth Fare currently is
alive, and if it is to die, it
will die a slow death. Besides
the several months it will
take CAB to reach a decision.
the airlines will most certain-
ly challenge any ruling
against the youth fare dis-
eounts. The final decision
will probably be in the hands
of the cour:s or Congress.
Several congressmen have
expressed a desire to amend
the Federal Aviation Act of
1958 so that youth fares are
specifically permitted.

upperclassmen, but some
council members. she said,
were reluctant to revise the
present set-up. ,

The issue was also raised
with the residence Hall Coun
cil, she said, and freshman
members generally favored
the idea. Upperclassmen on
the RHC were divided, some
fearing rush would be under

She added that most

lotte area.

“I'm particularly excited
about the exchange possibili-
ties which are available
within the newly devoloped
Charlotte area educational
venture with Belmont Ab
bey, Johnson C. Smith, and
several other local colleges

and universities." Kilpatrick
said.

He speculated that both
Students and __ institutions

could effectively pool their
talents within the Charlotte
area, exchanging ideas as
well’ as facilities, perhaps
formulating a program of re-
gional studies which would
invoive students from all. the

change of ideas on the eco
nomic, social and racial is
sues of the area.

Student exchange visits to
other schools have in the
past been limited to long
weekends. Kilpatrick stres
sed that one goal of the ex
change program is to allow
students to stay at other

schools for longer periods.

perhaps for a semester.

Although he noted that Da
vidson’s acadentic calendar
may prove prohibitive. Kil-
patrick said, ‘‘Davidson
needs to move away from
the concept that a degree
from Davidson means four
continual years on the cam
pus. A program allowing stu
dents to take part in the pro.
grams of other colleges for,
gay a semester,’ can be of
tremendous educational val-
ue.”

Kilpatrick sated that stu
dent exchange programs
would be open to all students,
although some of. the parti-
cipants in the program might
be SGA senators. *‘We'll be
formulating more = specific
plans in the spring as to ex
actly which schools we'l
visit and. when. At that time
all interested students will be
asked to sign up.’ Kilpat-
rick said.
