Former Military Ball To Be
Military—D Club Affair
Next Month

Includes Tea Dance And
Two Night Dances

Freddy Johnson and his Uni-
versity of—North Carolina or-
chestra will play for the com-
bined Military and “D” Club
Ball, dn March 13 and 14.

The Hellenic Council is
sponsoring this set, but is delegat-
ing the figures over to Scabbard
and Blade, honorary military fra-
ternity, and the “D"’ Club, David-
son’s athletic organization which
recognizes lettermen in the various
sports.

Pan -

Three Dances

The set will consist of three
dances, a Friday night formal, fea-
turing a‘Scabbard and Blade figure,
a tea dance on Saturday afternoon,
and an informal dance on Saturday
night, in honor ofthe “D"” Club;
All dances will be held in the Char-
lotte Armory, which will be avail-
able despite rumors to the contrary.

Homecoming, 1940

Freddy Johnson's orchestra ‘is
well known to Davidson students,
his last appearance here “having
been at the Homecoming Dances in
November, 1940. His organization
is similar in many respects to that
of The Duke Ambassadors, who
played for the Homecoming’ Dances
last fall.

Fifteen Musicians

The band consists of fifteen mu-
sicians, including a female vocalist,
Anne Russell. Said to be now the
most outstanding college band in
the south, Johnson’s. band was_only.
recently reorganized and has created
quite a sensation over at Chapet
Hill.

Price Not Set

The price of the set tickets has
not been detedmined yet, due to the
fact that the contract was signed
just before press time. This will
be arinounced in the next issue of
The Davidsonian, by the Pan-Hel-
lenic Council, who say that the
price will be on a par, if not lower
than that in effect at the Home-
coming set last fall.

Perform Drill

Although considered one of the
smaller sets of the year, these
dances are always among the most
colorful and brilliant, due to the
fact that all the members of Scab-
bard and Blade appear in uniform
at the Friday night dance. The
new members of this organization
perform a military drill as their
part of the figure, which adds con-
siderably to the festivities.

“D” Club

The “D” Club has not yet an-
nounced any plans for their figure
at the Saturday night dance, and
this.item, together with the price
of the set ticket will be announced
in next week’s Davidsonian.

Mr. George Rickey, a Faculty-
Student visitor, will be on the Da-
vidson campus during the second

“For example, a student who
wishes to take sophomore English
must take the whole course in one
of the two periods of the summer
session,” stated Dr. Brown.

A student may secure twelve
hours credit either by taking two
courses, one after the
other, or by taking an eight-hour
course and a four-hour course.

; Prospectus

On Friday, February 20, students
who now plan and expect to at-
tend the summer school will be
asked to give that information to-
gether with the names of courses
they would like to take. This in-
formation is necessary to enable
the school to plan the offerings of
the summer courses

The students will be asked to give
the information by signing a card in-
dicating tentative registraton, not
ultimately binding upon the student.
He is asked to give two choices
of courses for each period so as,to
indicate to the faculty the courses
which. the ‘students desire most.

Graduation Accelerated

Sophomores can accelerate their
work by taking advantage of two
full summer schools and thus grad-
uating in the summer of 1943.

Allied Reversals In Far East
Are Not The Fault Of
War Leaders

By CHARLES BROCKMANN

The fall of Singapore last
Sunday afternoon was a tragic
blowsto the Allied cause; per-
haps the greatest blow since
Dunkirk. “Lhat defeat, coupled

man battleships. through the

a storm of criticism upon
Churchill and his cabinet from
the English people.

On Sunday afternoon, Winston
Churchill calmly accepted blame
for both of these setbacks, and

told English-Speaking the
world over that they must expect
such defeats, and reverses until
England and the United States can
better adjust themselves to carry
on this war.
Blame Rests

Neither Churchill nor his sub-
ordinates deserve blame for Singa-
pore's fall—nor is Roosevelt re-
sponsible for our country's bad start
in the Pacific campaign. The blame,
if there be blame, rests upon the
phlegmatic Parliament and
Congress who are now so busily
engaged in criticizing their leaders’
inefficiency.

Not Efficient
It is a recognized fact that the
democratic form of government is
not efficient in aggressive prepar-
ation for war—it is not meant to
be. But the legislative bodies of
England, and the United States,
instead acknowledging _ their
slowness to act in the past few years,
now lay all blame for the current
defeats upon the leaders who tried

in vain to prevent them.

Churchill’s speech was direct and
sincere. Surely his fellow-country-
men must realize that theirs is
probably the greatest leader in the
world today. Surely they—and we

the faith and courage to bear with
and stand behind our leaders
through the first dark months of
the ordeal. Surely we can see
that these men are doing all that
is humanly possible with the ma-

utmost to make up for time lost in
past years. through no fault. of

Faculty Aids

In “Y” Forum

Students and faculty members
got together for an Open Forum
on student-faculty relations at Phi
Hall Wednesday night.

Davidson's faculty furnished
speakers for the discussion. Dr.
McGavock offered suggestions for
improving the relations between
students and faculty and breaking
down the barriers between better
co-operation; and then Dr. Fore-
man discussed the matter from a
scholastic viewpoint.

Also presenting their ideas on the
subject were Dr. Johnston and Pro-
fessor Fleagle.
