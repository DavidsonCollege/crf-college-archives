to Protect “Y” Room.

For some time past the need for
a committee to look after the “Y”
social room has been felt by the
students who have
selves of the privileges offered
there. Such 2 committee has re-
cently been appointed by Chalmers,
president of the ¥. M. C. A., with
J. P. Price at its head. There are
12 men of the Freshman class who
are divided up into six teams, two
men serving each day in the week
when the room is in use. Their duty
will consist of being in the soejal
room during the hours in the even-
ing to look after and care for the
equipment which has been placed
there for the enjoyment of all the
students.

SCRIPTURE GIFT MISSION, |
SPECIAL WORK.
The American Branch of the Serip-!
ture Gift Mission of London, England,
feels sure American Christians will be!
deeply interested in these special efforts
to circulate the Scriptures,
Indian Peace Celebrations. '
The “Peace” celebrations in’ India |!
are to take place during the month of
December. ‘The Secretary of the!
Scripture Gift Mission has just received
igome interesting information from the
Superintendent of the work in) India.
He says that they are printing special
Bible Portions in all the chief dialects
of the Indian Empire. “These will set
forth in the words of Holy Scripture

why Christ died, speaking of the Resur-
rection, the need of faith in the finished
work of Calvary, and urging repentance
upon all, and the cover will be an ap-
propriate picture of the King, and a
copy of the letter written by the King
about his daily Bible Reading.

It is hoped that about a million and
a quarter, at least, Gospels and Scrip-
ture Portions will be distributed.
amongst those who will be visiting the
large towns for the celebrations.

It is also hoped to present a special
bound ‘Peace Testament” to many of
the chief native officials in India.

The demand for the Scriptures all
over the country seems to be growing
fast. and hundreds of letters are received
from Missionaries of all Societies, at the
Calcutta depot, appealing for grants of
Scriptures.

The Gospel in France.

‘The Scripture Gift Mission has un-
dertaken a very large and far-reaching
work in France, a work which French
Christian workers have
taken up very keenly, and all feel that
it is a thing which France needs today,

The idea is as far as possible to
systematically place a gospel in every
home in that country. Much care will
be exercised in the efforts, and all read-
ers are asked to remember this special
work before the Throne of Grace.

It cannot be done in a day. It is ex-
pected to take some, years to be fully
accamplished, but: it is a scheme which
surely must appeal to all lovers of the -
Bible. The cost will not be small, and
the Mission has zsked for special dona-
tions, but surely if the Word can only
he gotten into the homes of France it
will be worth spending much money.
The ignorance in France regarding the
Scriptures is appaling. Many have
never heard the name Gospel, and have
no idea as to what it is, or the nessage
it contains.

It is hoped to form centers all over
the country, from which the workers
will radiate and thus reach the villages.

A beginning has already been made
in Paris, Marseilles, Nantes, Lyons.
and other large towns and encouraging
reports come in from time to time.

Gifts for the futherance of the work
of distribution of the Scripture may be
sent to the Secretary of the American
Branch, Robert. B. Haines, Jr. 119

Drawing the Line.

The Chairman—Don't you think, gen-
tlemen, in view of the high cost of liv-
ing, we ought to increase our pastor's
salary ?

Vestryman—That's all right. But
don't pay him for overtime on sermons.
—Life.

So teach us to number our days
that we may apply our hearts unto
wisdom. And let the beauty of the
Lord our God be upon us.” The
