Jackson Regrets Davidson De

By GRAY WILSON
Associate Editor

(Ed. Note: Assistant
Professor of Political Science
Bill Jackson has been denied
tenure for next fall since he
lacks a dissertation. His future
plans at the moment are un-
certain, but he wavers between
other teaching possibilities and
a staff job in Washington, D.C.
Herein are some parting
thoughts about Davidson.)

‘IT must leave at the end of the
year, but I would like to say that
in terms of procedure and fair
play the administration has
been extremely gracious and
generous. _

“Since I did not have the
required Ph.D. they offered me
time to produce some scholarly
publications though I already
have some materials which
were not found to be acceptable.

“I fundamentally disagree,
however, with the overall
judgment that my total con-
tribution to Davidson did not
warrant keeping me on without
the union card or its equivalent.

‘“‘The reason for this is
because I think my knowledge
of American government is con-
siderable. My research in-
terests are very much attuned
to the present situation in our
government and my com-
munity activism is something
which I think should have been
weighed.

“I think the greatest plus
about this place is the students;
their intellects, their moral
characters make you know that
you are teaching the future
leaders of this country.

“Therefore it has been a
privilege to teach such men. It

really hurts to give up such a
gift. The greatest tragedy about
Davidson is its unchallenged in-
tellect on campus; it has so

much potential still untapped i
the student body. m

“As for my colleagues, I’m
going to miss them very much.
They are a fine group of men
and women to live around. I
love them, their spouses, and
their children and beyond that
so many have been stimulating
intellectual companions. All
those in my own department
have _ been particularly
stimulating.

“If I had one general
criticism to make of the faculty
it would be this: though there is
substitute for intelligence, it is
not enough—people may be in-
telligent but lack the moral
courage to act.

‘Whitehead has said, ‘Duty
arises from our potential con-
trol over the course of events.’ I
hope my colleagues will take
this to heart. Eric Erickson has
also said: ‘Men make deals with
their conscience in order to feel
okay, in order to think of them-
selves as good. The best that
can be managed is that these
deals at last may be made with
the fullest awareness of what
the deal is.’

“Davidson is a comfortable
nest. I hope the faculty realize
what the deal is here. It is im-
portant in an age when
everyone's loyalty runs to in-
Stitutions that provide our
bread, butter, and security.

‘‘As for President Spencer, let
me say that some people find it
useful to make a distinction bet-
ween personal and profession
judgment. I think this is ar-
tificial, but it will serve my pur-
pose here.

Dorm Lottery Excludes 50

Fifty students were left out in the cold at the recen-
tly-held men’s independent housing lottery at Duke
University. There just is not enough housing for all
the students who want to live on campus.

If at least 150 people do not decide to move off cam-

pus, ‘‘we are in trouble,”

said Barbara Buschman,

secretary to Dean of Students Richard Cox, since
there would be no room on campus for the 50 students
as well as several others. Buschman did not expect to
have to put these people into places in fraternity sec-
tions, since the fraternities do not have as much space
as they have had in previous years. Buschman also

added that the excluded students will be notified, and
consulted if necessary, this summer concerning their

housing situations.

Students Receive Free Legal Advice

South Carolina Public Interest Research Group
(SCPIRG) has started the Legal Advisory Program
(LAP) at Furman University. LAP is a project
designed to provide students with free legal advice in
any matter that concerns them. Most of the questions
directed to LAP have been concerned with landlord-

rental or tax problems.

To obtain legal advice, students are interviewed at
the Furman Student Center, and their requests for
legal advice are forwarded to SCPIRG attorney Clif-
ford Gaddy, who researches the requests and then
gives legal opinioris. The average time lag from
request to response is one day.

“On a personal level we have
had some great times and he
was one of my best un-
dergraduate professors, for
which I am in his debt.

“He has a sense of public
responsibility which I ad:nire,
and I’m glad we have such a
distinguished educator as
president.

“I will say that I’ve been sad-
dened by a lack of leadership as 1
would desire it. For example, I
found the recent debate over
religious tenure very
distressing.

“I feel such an issue places an
obligation on the president to
work to rid the college of this
requirement.

“At the debate in question, I
thought there was a tinge of an-
ti-semitism made by some of
the participants. Both speakers
who were invited for the oc-
casion ended up defending
religious tenure.

“The trustees seem actually

to believe that Davidson is more
Christian than say South-
western, which has no religious
requirements.

“Christianity has been the
greatest influence on my life
and I would like to see that the
Christian faith always receives
advocacy on this campus.

‘‘But as long as we insist on
formally defining our Christian-
ity in a secular world, we are
headed toward becoming a
Presbyterian Bob Jones.

‘‘Academically able men
will want to teach here,
but will resent being told what
to believe in. Those who will
seek us out in coming years will
want to indoctrinate this cam-
pus against a world of infidels.

“IT don’t think the way to
maintain religious ties is
through formal barriers. Our
witness to the world might be
more convincing if we do not
worry about formally defining
who shall be on our faculty in
terms of active membership in

p arture

the Christian church.

“As for faculty-admin-
istration relations, it has
bothered me at times, call it
class sensitivity, that faculty
are treated as mere employees.

“‘No matter how hard working
the women in the secretarial
pool are, there is no way they
can service a 90 member
faculty.

“This grates on the faculty’s
sense of status. The ad-
ministration should provide
more staff support for faculty.

“Of course, facuity could also
treat more as colleagues ad-
ministrators, appreciate more
fully those in other enterprises
in this institution.

‘‘There is a general at-
mosphere in recent times that
makes me think the soul of this
place could be had for 30 pieces
of silver. We should be careful
as we go after public and
private funds and support lest
we jeopardize our academic
freedom in the process.’’.

Leonard Founds Lawn Service
For Landscaping, Maintenance

By VAL VAN HORN
Asst. Features Editor

Their card is beige-colored
with a snappy red bandana
illustrated, just like the red-
print ones so commonly seen,
except this one has a tied bow
like two calico leaves.

“The Red Bandanas’’, a lawn
service (for lack of a better

* term), was founded by Mark

Leonard, a rising senior, last
spring. It landscapes, but does
‘‘mostly maintenance,’’ ex-
plained Leonard, ‘‘clean up,

raking beds and pruning.”’

‘“‘I was ignorant of what it’d
eventually grow into,’’ he said.
“I did a lot of things wrong —
business dropped off by sum-
mer.”

Taking advantage of the slack
in business, Leonard set out to
improve. Working at Hugh
Smith Nurseries (‘the has a
local monopoly’’), Leonard said
that he'd learned a lot from
him, even though. Smith was

“old, not a particularly good —

manager, and slow dealing with
people.”

This spring Leonard decided

to consolidate with George ©

Thomas and Brad Sebastian.
“We three have gone from job
to job — went in, did it, got out.

“I’ve invested a considerable
amount in new equipment,
especially a roto-tiller, power
rake, and miscellaneous equip-
ment I need, little $20 items. I
have about $1250 in equipment,
including a pick-up truck.

“I'd like to talk to several of
the better home builders and
get out and get known in the
Lake Norman area, and let
them know about the quickness
and efficiency I can offer.

“I can tell them I have a
professional working with me in
landscaping — Ervin
Brawley... Ervin measures the
place and submits a lan-

dscaping plan. (Dean Johnson
also works with them.)

‘‘My goal for the future is to
develop a small nursery of my
own this summer. We get plants
from Smith’s Nursery, but I
want to be able to buy wholesale
from the huge nurseries they
have in Alabama,” he said.

“I'd like to be able to afford a
panel truck next fall and use it
with the pick-up. I also want to
continue with four people if I
can work up to that amount, and
do primarily landscaping. By
the end of the next year I hope
to have substantial clientelle for
that.

“I'll need a rising junior or
sophomore next year who's
really a go-getter to take over
and manage the business.”
Leonard, a philosophy major,

intends to sell ‘‘Red Bandanas”’
at the end of next summer and
go to graduate school.

‘Right now, if you’d like
some figures, the outgo has
been $3625 and the income is
$3140, so I’m a little behind yet.
Although right now it’s really
mostly maintenance, I’d like to
be eventually make it primarily
landscaping.

“There’s much more money
in landscaping and it’s mugh
more satisfying work. You can
see the immediate results from
your labor — look back at the
work you've done that day and
see how beautiful it looks.

“It’s really more satisfying
and a good type of work to do.
It’s good to get out and sweat a
while after studying hard at
Davidson.” he said.
