Side Lights!

BY RICK LOWERY

SUNSET...

Homecoming’s gone; so is the soccer team: there is
no football game this weekend (excu ;
and the weather's getting colder." Me freshmen);

As the winds blow and the leaves brown, the fall
sports seem to have almost drifted away like the last
dark blue cloud of daylight. But while the autumn sports
near a close, the winter sports are beginning to demand
more attention.

The basketball team enters its third week of prac-
tice, not altogether unnoticed. The indoor track team
has been running outdoors for most of the semester. And
two other squads have been at it two weeks unnoticed.
These two teams are, of course, the swimming and wrest-
ling teams.

But practice isn’t for the spectator and doesn’t make
very good reading. So against this background, a few
things that entered my mind this week.

AIN'T GOT NO HOME...

With the reality of the indoor sports upon the stud-
ent body and with the approach of the indoor. inter-
fraternity sports, when will the general student body be
able to use the gym?

The same problem presented itself last year and no

workable solution was found. Another. winter is here and}.

the prospects of student use of the gym are even less than
they were last year. This is a problem that can only be
solved through the action of the student body, but the
student body can only act through its representative
groups.

For this reason I would like to see the IMAC look
into the possibility of opening the gym for student use
at night. The IMAC is not the only student group that
could attempt to solve this problem. Although the limited
use of the gym is not a major problem of the Davidson
student body, this problem offers a concrete situation
where the Student Council could improve conditions for
the student.

For several years, student governing officials have
campaigned and orated about the worthwhile functions of
the Student Council. In all too many instances these func-
tions have had little direct effect upon the majority of
the students. Here, I think is an opportunity for the Stud-
ent Council to accomplish something that more than just
a handful can appreciate.

The solution of such a problem also seems to fall
within the area of many of those service clubs on campus
whose reason for being is to “serve.”

Again I say perhaps this problem is too trivial (I hope
not too practical) for any of those busy organizations. I
hope not.

PLAUDITS... |

The flickerball players and spectators have generally
had only praise for the way the IMAC has run this. year’s
program. I would like to add mine. The season was com-
pleted with a minimum of confusion (schedules written
and delivered consistently) and a maximum of simplicity
(the only serious dispute all year was worked out by the
two teams, and there were few if any game cancellations).

1 would like to make two suggestions. First, elimin-
ate the Tuesday games. Although this would lead to a
longer season, most teams complained that these games
were often played in darkness and long after the dinner
hour. The second suggestion is a more formal codification
of the playing rules which aroused questions throughout
the year. ;

Again, congratulations.

THE WINNER... a

Few will argue that this years Kappa Sigma flicker-
ball team was as good as last year. However, even fewer|
will argue that it was the top team in the league this year.
In finishing the season undefeated (not undefeatable) the
Kappa Sigs extended their three year

and two defeats.
Since the birth of flickerball in 1951 when the KA’s

won on the final day, no team has held such a strangle-:
hold over the number one spot. Whether this domination
will continue will have to wait until next year. The win-
ner and still champion—this year—the Kappa Sigs.

TOPS oee . . .

In a rather disappointing Homecoming tie last week, '
Benny Coxton turned in two touchdowns, one of which
came on a 90-yard punt return. . ,

You'll have to pardon me for saying he wasn’t the
outstanding player on the field. Earl Cole completing 11
passes and making several outstanding defensive plays

once again caught this writer’s eye as the most impressive | |

ball player on the field.
“YOU JUST HACK ME OFF”...

One other thing caught my attention Saturday. Just
put it down to personal dislikes, but it bugs me. Nearby
in the stands a gentleman (and I know he was because he |
wore a name tag proclaiming him to be an alumnus) ex-
claimed in a raised tone of voice (a microphone wouldn't :
have helped) that one of Davidson's players “had stomach j

roblems,” that is—no guts.
J The player goes unnamed, he played both ways and
the inference that he is a coward has gone unnoticed for |
four years. But I guess it takes a “real” fan to spot some-
thing like that. Frankly I never noticed; ali I could
think of was an old Durwood Settles joke that goes. . .

Eckman Leads Surge |
Over Appalachin State

BY ERIC NICHOLS

Soccer coach Harry Fogleman emptied the bench last Friday as Walt Eckman hit
the scoring parade to lead the ‘Cats to a 6-1 victory over Appalachian. Eckman
scored three goals, bringing his season total to eight.

Both Eckman and co-captain
Fred Schoen stand within one
goal of tying the all-time season
record of nine set by Schoen
last year. With four games re-
maining, they’ possess an excel-
lent chance to boost the record.

BULLETIN

In a soccer match with Ogle-
thorpe Thursday afternoon the
‘Cats continued their winning
ways with a 9-3 win. Walt Eck-
man kicked goals nine and ten
to break Fred Schoen’s sea-
son scoring record. Schoen
himself was ejected from the
game after a fight with the
Oglethorpe goalie.

Junior halfback Jan Brake!

Led by returning all stars
Rick Lowery, Buddy DuBose and
Eddie Earle, the Kappa Sigs
swept through their twelve
game slate undefeated.

All was not as easy at least
five teams, notably the KA's,
Sig Bps and Sigma Chi’s had a
good shot at knocking off the
undefeated champions. In each
of these games The Snappers
roared back to overcome a defi-
cit late in the game. —

Leading scorer for the Sigs
was end Gross Compton who
personally totaled over 100
points. Manning the other end
was Howard Arbuckle whose
last-second clutch catches -re-
sulted in two wins. The remain-
der of the Sig offensive power
‘was shouldered by’ sophomore
Tommy Reams, freshman Joe

The defensive team’s strength
lay in the unsung performances
of rusher Bones McKinley, cen-
ter linebacker “P” Morris and
halfback Arnie Goodstein.

Although this year’s cham-
pions were neither overpower-
ing on offense nor on defense,
they managed to combine these
two phases of the game to score
more points than any of their
opponents.

Strongest competition for the
Sigs was provided by the KA’s
who lost but two games—one to
the Sigs in the last twenty-five
seconds.

This year’s league was prob-
ably better balanced than any
in recent memory. Each team
had at least one or more out-
standing players.

This was verified last Wednes-
day night as the 1963 flicker-
ball all star team was selected
by the ballots of the flickerball
players themselves. Five teams,

Last Saturday was a beautiful afternoon for football.
The Wildcats turned in a spirited game, beating the Pres-
byterian College team in every department, except the
score. Still pursuing victory, the "Cats managed a 14-14
tie—still a poor substitute for a win.

free kick outside the penalty
circle as he neatly arched the
ball over the heads of the de-
fense into the cage.

Davidson hit the hapless
Apps on the rebound from an:
unfortunate defeat at the hands
of N.C. State. A combination of
an aggressive offense and a very
weak Appalachian defense ac-
counted for the comparatively
easy victory.

The first quarter saw the ball
almost entirely dominated by
Wildeat heads and shoes. The
only factor that kept Davidson
from scoring in double figures
was Appalachian's defense,
which consisted of as many as
eight of their players grouped
around the cage.

The first tally of the game
came as Schoen ably subdued a
bewildered goalie and several
defensive men. Caught for using
hands four times, Appalachian
was down another point when
Brakel converted a penalty kick.

Second half scoring was most-
ly Eckman’s game. Schoen set
him up for one; he put in anoth-
er goal left-footed and barely
missed.a head shot in the fourth
quarter.

One of the interesting side-
lights of the game was that
Fogleman emptied the benches
and at one point had a team of
sophomores and juniors on the
field that will likely be his
starting team for next year.

The Davidson squad has now
tied the all-time team scoring
record of 28 with four games
remaining. By their return Sat-
urday from a trip to Atlanta to
play Oglethorpe College and
Emory, the team could be sport-
ing close.to 40 points.

Fogleman commented after
the game that playing Appala-
chian and also Guilford, Pfeiffer
and Campbell gives us no credit
towards an invitation to the
N.C.A.A. playoffs because these
four teams have no N.C.A.A.
standing.

Davidson has been advised by
the N.C.A.A. soccer chairman for
this area that it would be better
off entering the college playoffs
to be held at Tufts University
in Medford. Mass. This was due
in part to the loss to N.C. State
last week and to the size of the
schools entering in this division.

Davidson would be competing
at Tufts against schools mote
of our enrollment figure and of
the same type of athletic pro-
gram. Fogleman. added that the
next four games must be vic-
tories or “‘We’ve had it for a
chance at anything.”
