Facilities Planning: Campus Keeps Pace with College

By SUZANNE CRAYMER

Look around. Faces change, people
change, and with them, Davidson changes.
Grover Meetze, head of facilities plan-
ning, has been meeting the changing needs
of Davidson for 25 years. Through remod-
eling, building, and developing, he has

dating changing priorities.

Current campus needs include a large
sports complex and expanded student hous-
ing. As with every new project, Meetze

encourages questions and input from all

sides: students, faculty, administration,
alumni,:town members, and outside archi-
tects and planners.

“I want to involve the world,” says
Meetze.

Meetze’s ability to successfully incorpo-
rate design with Davidson’s needs is re-
flected in his past projects as well. These
have included Richardson Dorm, Cunning-
ham Fine Arts Building, Perkins Audito-
rium, and the E. H. Little Library.

The conversion of the old library to the -

learning and powing manifests itself in his

that a majority of students choose a college

Meetze’s principle of renodeling rather
than rebuilding. Meetze stresses excel-
lence and architectural balance, following
the standards and design set by Phi and Eu

Halls.

Meetze also believes in maintaining
Davidson’s open atmosphere. “Sometimes
the best use of space is no use,” Meetze
affirms. As a basic rule of thumb, Meetze
strives to convey the feeliag of comfort in
his designs.

An attempt to localize buildings with
respect to their use is another consideration.

_ Present organization includes centralized

academic, sports, housing, social, and
administrative areas.

The Facilities Planning Office, located at
#9 Jackson Court, is designed to serve the
students, both past and present.

Meetze, a Davidson graduate from the
class of °55, emphasizes this by saying,
“I’m still a student.” His enthusiasm for

For aquarter of acentury, Grover Meetze
has played a profound rola in shaping
Davidson’s campus, and hopefully, his
influence will extend far into the future.

Always planning ahead, however,
Meetze has advice to pass on to his succes-
sor. He intends to leave that person witha
copy of the‘large photograph which hangs
in his office.

The picture, taken in front of Phi and Eu
halls, shows large grassy fields in the fore-
ground, with several buildings and a group
of students attending an outdoor class in the
background.

Meetze views this photograph as a re-.
minder. “When you’ve got a good thing,
don’t-mess it up.” The picture embodies
everything he believes to be essential to
Davidson’s development: the wide, open
spaces preserved, the involvement of
people, and the maintenance of the histori-
cal architecture.

Whitewater rafting helps sp ark personal interaction

By STAN HYNDS

The water was indeed white.
Our rafts were sleek and (I don’t
mind telling you) we looked good,
smartly decked in paddle jackets
and wet suits. Mild temperatures
and magnificent fall color graced
our weekend as well. The ele-
ments were highly favorable for
an exciting run, and we were not
disappointed. A group of 30
Davidsonians, in association with
Davidson Outdoors, pulled off a
smashing whitewater raft trip on
the French Broad River on Octo-
ber 16 and 17. In the immortal
words of Ed Daugherty, “We red-
lined the fun meter.” —

It is clear to me, however, that
our raft trip, like all outdoor expe-
riences, was only partly com-
prised of the actual physical ad-
venture. This trip, which began’
with an overnighter at Mill Ridge,
provided me not so much with

. whitewater memories, but instead
with memories attributable to
personal interaction and observa-
tion. The uniqueness of the envi-
ronment created an unavoidable
kinship with the other partici-
pants. It is One reason outdoor

his craft more like a submarine
than an inflatable raft. The guide-
less team of Dan and Hill Harris,
Chuong Vu, and Sigrid Cook was
impressive in its self-guided mis-
sile. Mealtime on the river was a
highlight.

‘The friendly outfitters from
Nantahala Outdoor Center pack a
very decent lunch. And Chip “I
didn’t eat breakfast’” Cole made
his way through the food line at
least twice.

By the time we reached the
take-out point, the tired crew was
ready for a hot shower (which they
really didn’t get).and a dry set of
clothes.

Two of my personal trip heroes
were Drew “Pneumonia” Hender-
son who shared his talents behind
the wheel and in front of the stove

able to enjoy the rafting, and

experiences are so valuable. It is
certainly the reason I’m glad I was
part of the outing on the French
Broad River last weekend.

So I’m reminded not only of
maneuvering (however clumsily)
through a rapid called “the Maze,”

but also of Chef Julia Walsh play-

ing musical spaghetti sauce with
three pots of sauce and two stoves.

gatta of funyaks (affectionately
termed “ducks” for the waddling
path they take in flat water), is no

- The raft guides’ commands of

“All forward! All back!” and (my

personal favorite) “Drift!” echo —

no more clearly than the words of

Randy “Guitar” Lewis: “I wanna

wash some dishes.”

Weall got achuckle out of Ford
“Foilage” Shippey’s admission
; that, “I used to think foilage was a

dirty word.” Ford, I might add, is .

an alarming sight in the morning.
Deepak “Deeptan” Talwar and

‘Ranjit “Two Ls and a Q” Rawlley
broadened my understanding of

Indian culture as well as my Hindi
vocabulary.

Tina “the Electron” Laidlaw
served up her famous wilderness
hash browns which are fast ap-
proaching legendary status. On
the other hand, Joe “Pasta” Ham-
mond was largely responsible for
the most heinous batch of noodle

gruel I’ve ever had to pitch. And it
was a good thing Diana Titus
“Hyphen” Allen was along to lead

. us in swell campfire games and

activities. Determined to beat the
cold, Margaret “Polar Bear” Bled-
soe wore enough clothes to bed to
render her immobile. Meanwhile,
Lindsey “It Was Cold” Forsythe
said, “It was cold.”

But this was a raft trip and in-

deed, there were memorable
moments on the water as well. Joe

and Deepak demonstrated their

photos of the trip and, along with
Diana, put together a stirring dis-
play in the Union Lobby.

By any measure, this trip was a
success. Whitewater rafting is a
thrill.

What is even better, though, is
getting along in an inspiring envi-
ronment with a diverse group of
students and staff. :

lam grateful to have been a part
of that group. I hope you will feel
the same way when you come .
along with Davidson Outdoors.
