RESPONSIBILITY THE KEY

CRAP .?roposes New Rule Attitude

PREAMBLE

As a college of liberal arts com-
mitted to the Christian faith, Da-
vidson College seeks to liberate
men physically, mentally and
Spiritually. Its primary purpose
is to develop men of humane in-
Stincts, and of disciplined and
creative minds for lives of lead-
ership, service and self-fulfill-
ment.

Recognizing that the educa-
tional process encompasses far
more than academic activities,
Davidson College believes that its
purpose is promoted or hindered
by the quality of the total life of
the college community. The pro-
motion of a climate that is most
conducive to the realization of its
educational aims is the sole rea-
son for the promulgation of a
code of responsibility.

The present code of responsi-
bility is based upon the belief
that Davidson’s educational pur-
pose can best be advanced in a
context which emphasizes the re-
sponsible use of freedom, as op-
posed to license. The aim of this
code: is to encourage individuals
to develop responsible judgment
capable of directing their con-
duct with a minimum of specific
prohibitions.

An elaborate system of rules
Strictly enforced might promote
a surface conformity to the stan-
dards of behavior desired, but
would not effectively serve to
develop the maturity of charac-
ter which is the aim of the col-
lege. Rather, responsible matur-
ity is more likely to develop
when a member of the college
community is both free and ob-
ligated to wrestle with principles
of conduct and to accept full re-
sponsibility for his own actions
and decisions.

Specific rules are laid down in
this code only when they seem
necessary to prevent actions
which would infringe upon the
freedoms and _ well-being of
others, or would endanger per-
sons or property, or would be
disruptive of community life.

|. CODE OF

RESPONSIBILITY
1. Academic Responsibility:

The pursuit of truth and the
development of community mem-.
bers are basic to the existence of
Davidson. College. Free inquiry
and free expression are indispen-
sable to the attainment of these
aims. Members of the academic
community are encouraged to
develop the capacity for critical
judgment and to engage in a sus-
tained and independent search
for truth. :

Freedom to teach and freedom
to learn are inseparable facets of
academic freedom. The freedom
to learn depends upon appro-
priate opportunities and condi-
tions in the college community.
Such freedom should be exer:
cised with responsibility.

The development of insti
tional procedures which pf
and safeguard this freedoms a
responsibility shared by all mem-
bers of the academic community.
2. Financial Responsibility:

Consistent with the idea of
responsible conduct expressed
within the code is the belief that
financial integrity is an integral
part of maturity. As such, it is
the responsibility of members of
the entire community to settle
satisfactorily all outstanding fi-
nancial obligations. These obli-
gations should be resolved solely
between those persons or that
person and organization involved.
Such an instance is a financial
obligation between a student and
a fraternity.

3. Honer Offenses:
Every student shall be honor

Every student shall be honor
bound to refrain from lying un-
der oath.

Every student shall be honor
bound to report immediately all
violations of the Honor System
which come under his observa-
tion; failure to do so shall be a
violation of the Honor System.
Each student is excepted to be
familiar with the operation of the
Honor System.

4. Social Responsibility:

' Davidson College recognizes
the fact that social life is an op-
portunity to develop social ma-
turity. It expects the members of
the community to use this op-
portunity responsibly in keeping
with the standards of the David-
son campus. Such responsibility
jincludes conduct in fraternity
houses, in dormitories, at the
College Union, and at social func-
tions sponsored by Davidson Col-
lege and all its organizations.
The presidents of the fraternities
and other social organizations
will use his influence to see tlrat
the members of these organiza-
tions exercise personal responsi-

ity.

5. Misconduct Which Affects the
Property, Person or Rights of
Others:

It is the responsibility of mem-
bers of the college community to
respect the property, person and
rights of others. Therefore, mem-
bers of the community will not
engage in any form of activity
which results in or might natur-
ally result in (1) damage to prop-
erty, (2) injury to person, (3) in-
terference with the rights of
members of the community or
visitors, or (4) interference with
the normal activities of the col-
lege.

edically unsupervised
ssion or distribution of
potentially harmful drugs such
as hallucinogens, amphetamines,
barbiturates and opiates is illegal
and subject to very harsh penal-
ties. Further, the use of many of
these drugs threatens the physi-
cal and mental health of the
users, and the use by one person
may also threaten the welfare of
others. Therefore, the college
cannot tolerate the medically un-
supervised use, possession or dis-
tributino of any of these drugs.
8. Firearms and Explosives:

In that the maintenance of fire-
arms can result in bodily injury,
anyone desiring to keep or use a
firearm on the Davidson campus
must obtain written permission
from the Student Senate. Fire-

s edl

arms kept on the campus must be
stored in a special area designat-
ed by the Student Senate.

Since the possession or use of
firecrackers and other explosives
in the Davidson community
would pose a serious threat to
the safety of the other members
of the community, their posses-
sion or use is not allowed any-
eere in the Davidson commun-

9. Response to Campus Security
fficers:

Members of the college com-
munity shall comply honestly
with all requests made by the
Campus Security Officers, includ-
ing the showing of their college
identification cards.

10. Dormitories:

(See Box, New Drinking .. .)
11. Campus Regulations:

Realizing the requirements of
an harmonious community life,
Davidson College recognizes the
need for certain detailed proced-
ures regarding the operation of
the community, which nonethe-
less should be distinct from this
code. Every member of the com-
munity is expected to be familiar
with the body of campus regula-
tions and the rules of the Resi-
dence Hall Association.

Il. JUDICIARY

This system is based on the
following assumptions: (a) a joint
student-faculty regulations court
is necessary for the realization of
the basic aim of this code to
eliminate any dichotomy in the
regulations, disciplinary, and
judicial systems of Davidson Col-
lege; (b) a multiplicity of courts
would be not only inconsistent
with the philosophy of this code
but would also endanger the ef-
ficiency and justice of the judi-
cial system.

Therefore, with the adoption
of this code by the student and
the faculty and with the approv-
al of the trustees, the following
judiciary is established:

Section 1. Courts and Jurisdiction
A. The Davidson College Regula-
tions Court

The Davidson College Regula-
tions Court shall consist of twelve
members, six students and six
faculty. The faculty members
shall be elected by the faculty
and shall serve as long as that
body so desires. Members of the
Faculty Executive Committee
shall not serve on the Court. The
student members shall be elected
in the spring by and from each
class except the senior class.
Each class shall elect one mem-
ber. Each member shall serve
from his inauguration until the
inauguration of new members
his senior year. The student sec-

But Calvinism Stays Put

it. PHILOSOPHY OF

DISCIPLINE

Because of the nature of
man, it is inevitable that there
will be violations of the Code
of Responsibility. For this rea-
son the Philosophy of Disci-
pline has been established.

The purpose of this philoso-
phy is to formulate a guide-
line for discipline in the con-
text of a responsibly mature
community. The absence of

specific punishments for speci-
fic violations gives much flexi-
bility, used in a responsible
manner, to the judicial courts.
This freedom allows the court

the opportunity to consider
each infraction individually,
and make its decisions accord-
ing to the seriousness of the
offense.

The Regulations Court and
the Honor Court have the right
and power to administer disci-
plinary action, up to and in-
cluding suspension. The Resi-
dence Hall Association House
Committees have such power
as designated by the RHA Con-
stitution.

IV. AMENDMENT

PROCEDURE
Amendments to this Code of
Responsibility can be pro-

posed only by a joint student-

7

faculty committee selected for
that purpose. This committee
may be called by either a 3/4
vote of the Student Senate, a
written petition from 25 per-
cent of the student body, or by
a 2/3 vote of the faculty. This
revision committee shall con-
sist of four members of the
student body selected by the
Student Senate and four mem-
bers of the faculty selected by
the faculty. The amendment
that this committee proposes
can be ratified by a 2/3 vote of
both the student body and the

faculty.

encourage the use of alcoholic
beverages by members of the
