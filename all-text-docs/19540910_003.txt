SHORTIES
BY CAM CRIDLEBAUGH

As the beginning of the 1954
football season approaches, the
outlook is much brighter than
it has been for the three oth-
er seasons that I've seen come
and go. For the first time since
the post-war influx of students,
Davidson has a football team
with depth. This season Coach
Dole will be able to take a man
out of the game and send in a
replacement that can ade-
quately fill the job. There is a
good crop of varsity veterans
back along with the unusually
strong last year’s freshman
team.

The thirteen freshmen in-
vited to participate in this
years varsity drills seem to
be just as promising as Coach
Dole’s “'53 Wildkittens.” The
spirit on the team is high and
as Coach Hambright _ -
they’re “wukin’ hard.” If the
boys don’t kill each other in
practice, the sports world will
know that Davidson is on the
football field this fall.

JV CALL

Although only thirteen
freshmen are out for football
so far, the number is expected
to swell when the JV call is
issued after orientation. Due
to an early season injury, Le-
roy Fargason will joi Coach
Bill Acker with the JV coach-
ing job. Wrestling coach Char-
lie Parker says that he'll be
along to chaperone.

We welcome back to the
squad freshmen Jim Fasul and
Charlie Rankin. Both men, who
hail from Fayetteville, have
been out of action for the last
couple years.

“Big Pete” and “Tiny”

Harry “Big Pete” Peterson
will head the Court of Con-
trol this semester. Pete might
be the meanest man around
Davidson but he’s no longer
the heaviest. Brown “Tiny
Hamer, a tackle from Dillon,
S. C., outweighs him by 67
(yes 67) pounds. “Tiny” doesn't
let his great amount of weight
keep him from moving. He ran
a 50 ard wind sprint in 6.9
the other day.

Our Unsung Heroes,
The Lowly Managers
Keep The Team Going

BY BUSTER SHARP

When we go to a football game
we only see what is taking place
on the field, but we fail to see the
preparation that makes the game
progress on time. All of this is not
the coaching of the staff. Many jobs
are the direct work of the mana-
gers of the club. 9

The manager works equally as
hard in practice as during the ac-
tual game. During practice he,
along with his assistants, must see
that clean equipment is at the dis-
posal of the players when needed
and that towels and ‘soap are ready
at the close of practice.

When different colored jerseys
lare used in a scrimmage the man-
| ager must have them in the hands
jof the right player at the right
itime. He must see that all the
equipment used by the team in
practice is in proper working or-

is the lowly janitor. He gets all the
dirty work.

During the game he must see
|that the players have the proper
| uniform and that each one is ready
|for the game as far as his gear is
leoneerned. The success of the

‘

Record September heat waves and two-a-day practices
haven't slowed the 1954 edition of the Davidson College Wild- |
cats in preparing for their nine-game season that starts with |
the military men of VMI at Lexington, Va., September 18th.

In a strong effort to have his
team in top physical condition and
the best running order offensive-
ly and defensively, Coach Dole has
been running the men twice daily,
with a skull practice in the early
evening. Now that school will soon
be beginning for all students, the
regular schedule of one workout a
day will start next Wednesday.

Thacker Strong

All-Star Jim Thacker will be
leading the hustling Wildcats in
their initial invasion of the sea-
son and judging from practice ses-
sions to date his performance will
be greater than ever.

Other standout backs who prom-
ise to do stellar duty this year are:
quarterbacks Dyke Little and Bill
Rowland, halfbacks Harley Smith,
Don McRee, and Don Campbell, and
fullbacks Henry Brown and Ken
Conger.

In the line, a starting team now
would probably include these men:
center Bo Abernathy, guards Dic-
kie Davis and Jim Fasul, tackles
Harry Petersen and Harold Davis,
and ends Tom Newton and Jim
Patterson.

Arriving on the campus ten days
before the freshmen began com-
ing to the Hill for Orientation, the
Wildeats have been hard at work
under the skillful eyes of Head

:

two three-year lettermen, Dickie |
Davis and Jim Thacker.

Other members of the football
roster includes: ends Bob Camp-
bell, Bill Gramley, Richard Jordan,
Corky King, Arthur Lynn, Lea
Powell, Charles Rankin; tackles
Dan Everhart, Tom Firor, Brown
Hamer, Little Howard, Adair Hat-
cher, Ken Lawing, Tom Lee, John
Lennon, Dick Jones; guards Dale |
Gramley, Lyle Llewellyn, David Me-
Clain, Tom Owen, Bob Stancil, Bob
Talbert; centers Tal Broughton,
Don Moore, Bill Price, and Eugene
Reid; quarterbacks Dick Belton, Ol-
lie Harris; fullbacks David Fagg,
Mike Fennegan, Leroy Fargason,
Russell Rogers, Jim West; and half-
backs Don Comer, Barney Poole,
and Ralph Setzler.
