Ng sooner» than
one sport ends, does
another begin. | It
took exactly two
days to switch from
football to basket-
ball and since the

last Davidsonian
went to press a team
has been chosen,
been trained, and

has won a tight ball
game. Last Monday
the Wildcats opened

their schedule
against a good U.S.
By JOE STUKES Rubber Co. team.

Their players were a good bit older than ours and had evi-
dently more experience. But Davidson’s vigor and fight-
ing spirit balanced what advantage they might have and|
the ’Cats roared through to win in the last Jere minutes,
54-46. It was thrilling all the way and the score was
never 10 points in favor of either team. The high scorer |
of the evening was Baker of the Rubber Co, with 24 points.
He made sensational, one-handed hook shots from all cor-
ners of the court, and sunk a good percentage of them.
Lowry of Davidson sunk 19 to lead the ’Cats scoring.

It was the first game for the team and they made a good.
showing. They play Wofford in Spartanburg Wednesday
night and I hope that the Terriers will take my advice and
not consider the Davidson team a breather.

Intramural basketball also swept onto the scene and
has stolen the spotlight for the last week. The SPE’s and
3etas remain unbeaten after a week of play and when those
two play tonight rivalry and interest should hit its. peak.
(I am taking no bets. )

Here we come to another limb and herd we go out on
it! We predict Southern Cal., Duke, Tech, the South, the
East, and Randolph Field as winners on or about New
Year’s Day.

With this horrible colyum, the Sports Department
(that’s me) wishes to you one and all a very Merry Christ-

mas and a Happy New Year. a
