A Davidson Dorm.
As Seen By A Frosh

How quiet and peaceful the Da-
vidson dormitory seems late Sat-
urday night! Only an occasional
beam of light makes its way through
the assorted bottles which line the
windows and indicates to a deserted
campus those who, perhaps sleepy,
perhaps broke, have not ventured
into the wilds of Charlotte.

A few short hours later, however,
the place has returned to its nor-
mal condition. Once again the old
brick walls tremble at the shouting
and singing of the returning adven-
turers. What a pleasure it is to
awake from a boring dream to re-
alize that they have returned to
sing for you once more!

And then while one lies there
in blissful insomnia, he can ex-
press, in thoug!its at least, his grat-
itude to all t'e« different kinds of
people who contribute their talent
or lack of it, toward making dormi- ;
tory life an adventure worth remem-
bering.

Among the most notorious enter-
tainers which we are blessed with
are the so called “musical” individ-
uals, This word is, of course, used
in a rather loose sense here; the
loudest exponents of music nearly
always seem to be remarkably un-
musical. The inter-dormitory sing-
ing contests, usually held in the
early morning hours, would be
sufficient proof for anyone that our
Davidson singers are right up there
with the loudest in any group.

This college has produced some
great men; who knows but that an-
other Tyrone Touchbottom may be
forthcoming?

Of course not everyone appre-
ciates our “musical’’ friends; they
are apt to be much less appreciated
if they persist in taking showers
at odd times. The appeal of vocal
acrobatics is utterly lost for some
when it is mingled with the round
of water gurgling down a drainpipe
and the clutter of wooden shoes on
cement floors.

None thie less formidable in the
realm of entertainment are those
who have pugilistic inclinations.
Their admirable fortitude not on-
ly carries them through their P. T
classes but also enables them to

engage in muscular -exertion at
other times too. (I rather doubt,
however, that they really do use

benzedrine in their wheaties).

It is especially uplifting to have
these fellows as roammates if they
are upperclassmen, It is much eas-
ier for a freshman to become im-
mured in the College traditions of
laundry carrying and errand run-
ning if there is a helpful upper-
elassman nearby for encourage-
ment and advice.

When one wakes up in the early
morning and hears the floor above
creaking and groaning as some hu-
man form’s noisily bounced on its
head, he may not be amused but he
can be sure that this educational
influence is in operation upon some
fortunate freshman.

American Campuses

Greenville, S. C.—At this time
of year many college papers catry
features beginning, “In the spring
a young man’s fancy turns, ete,’’
Feature writer of the Furman Uni-
versity Hornet presents different
ways in which campus men are af-
fected by the season:

“There is the ‘Bard’ type who,
when smitten by spring love, breaks
into flowing verse. From the head
of one such ailing student we have
this little ditty:

I love you from the top of me
head to the bottom of me heel,
There ain't no proper words to
tell you ‘zactly how I feel,

But if I finds I’se been a fool,
and you don’t love me too,

[ know darn well, I just can’t
live,

So I'l! turn into a Shmoo.

“Budding love works in myster-
ious fashion indeed, There are a
few who have turned into the ‘Glas-
sy-eyed’ type since Cupid flipped
his dart. These, one secs strolling
around the campus with a.copy of
‘Adventures of Casanova’ under
each arm. You can spot them easily
by their bandaged noses. They al-
ways bang their noses walking into
trees, wandering fraternity men, or
other obstructions,

“Then there is the absent-mind-
ed type. Closely akin to the ‘Glas.
sy-eved in his preoccupation, this
type .1, and usually does, manage
to uct into many embarrassing sit-
uations. One of this type recently
got up in the morning, and, in a
daze, thought he was going to a
dance. He put on his tuxedo, stag-
gered to school, and signed up a
professor for the first two no.
breaks before he realized where he
was.

“Also seen on the campus these
days is the ‘Stag jump’ type. They
usually carry a flower in their teeth
and glide over the tops of parked
cars in leaps and bounds, A pro-
fessor, meandering into Science
Hall one morning, observed an ex-
ample of this type sliding down the
bannister. When he asked the
young gentleman the reason for
his odd behavior, the reply was,
‘Odd, did you say odd, doctor? You
see, I’m in love. And I just feel
so loose.’

“With this the young man bowed
gracciully, did three back flips out
the door, walked on his hands to
Main, climbed the ivy, rang the bell
from the outside and when last
seén, was floating over the stadium
on a-pink cloud. The professor
picked up his pipe.

“Then, of course, there is the
jealous type. You can spot this type
easily. They invariably have green
eyes, and usually carry a conceal-
ed weapon. You see them peering
around corners at their girls get-
ting off the bus, or hiding in the
bushes beside the library steps. If
one looks at their girls more than
once, he is required to send an ex-
planation in triplicate or be chal-
lenged to a duel.

“The ‘Budding Romeo’ type is
dashing. He sings under the win-
dows of the sorority houses. He
throws blossom to the girl in the
window. They put the blossoms in-
to pots and throw them back at
him. Since the vines at the houses
are inadequate, he climbs up sheets
tied togetlier to reach his love. He
hardly ever reaches her. Some
smart cat in a lower window al-
ways unties a knot, and he falls
on his face. But he is happy. He is
in iove.

“The last, and saddést type is the
‘Injured Heart’ lover. He sits in
class and broods over his blighted
life. An instructor recently asked
one of this type if he thought Win-
ston Churchill would win power
again. The stricken ove answered
listlessly, “If you want him, darl-
ing, take him, I'll not stand in your
way.” \

—

“The music was nice,” replied

the ttle girl when the minister
asked how she liked the service,
“bu: 1 thought your commercial

was too long.”

their truth. Tension is necessary to

growth. Davidson cannot undergird |
us merely by indoctrinating us; set

must teach us the art of evalua
tion.

We arrive at college with a cet
tain set of opinions and _ ideas,
moral, political and social, By the
time we graduate we should not
only have become conscious ot
what those ideas are, but we should
have reached some decision as to
their value. We can do this only

if we collide with other standards
and so have a basis for comparison.
Thus we can test our own intel
lectual and moral fiber—and
velop it for later, more stringent
tests. For we cannot stay at Da
vidson forever.

In regard to the aforementioned
comments of those who want Da-!
vidson to preserve an iron-clad ver-
sion of the status quo, we may
serve that denial the right
of free speech will make us no more
democratic; a scorn of “East-Side
Jews” will make us no more Chris-
tian; and ‘an implied equating of
“Calvinistic Christianity and free
enterprise democracy” will make
us no more clear-minded. David-
son must be “higher ground” in
the real sense; we will not be sat-
isfied to let her become a haystack
sheltering the tender-minded.
