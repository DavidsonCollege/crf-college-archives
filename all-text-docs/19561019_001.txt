BREAK FROM TRADITION

New Course
Into Liberal

Blends Math
Education

Mathematics 11-12 S, a new addition to the mathematics
curriculum at Davidson this semester, is part of a general
transition in college mathematics.

For the first time in fifty years
the whole setup of college mathe-
matics is undergoing vast study
and change. Wide experimentation
characterizes this in American ed-
ucation,

Gradual development over a
period of years has preceded the
realization of the course. A need
for this type of approach to mathe.
matics has become increasingly
evident here.

“Too often many good men are
forced through a technical math
course,” said Dr. W. G. McGavock.
“They emerge from this experi-
ence with very little understand-
ing of what they have been sub-
jected to.”?

RELATION OF MATH

“This course is designed to show
how mathematics fits into a liberal
education,” McGavock continued.
“It tries to illustrate the relation
of mathematics to other fields of
learning.”

Besides this broad outlook,
Mathematics 11-12 S has three
more specific purposes. It is pri-
marily a class for freshmen who
do not plan a science major. It
minimizes the technical points of
mathematics and emphasizes the
theoretical.

Mathematical ideas and founda-
tions, not. formulas,are its main
concern.

Students qualified for the class
by passing the mathematics test
given during orientation week.
From those who passed, the Mathe-
matics Department selected the
twenty-four men now composing
the two sections. The future of
the course depends upon the reac-
tion of both students and faculty

Program Presented
For Union Activities

The David Ovens College Union
has several events on its schedule
for next week of interest to the
student body.

On Tuesday, Navy recruiters will
be in the front lounge and pri-
vate dining room all day. At 7:30
p.m. there will be a bridge tourna-
ment in the ballroom.

On Wednesday, five full-color
woodcuts by Ross Abrams, a Rich-
mond, Virginia, artist, will be dis-
played. These woodeuts were made
on the island of Majorea, off the
coast of Spain. Some of Mr. Abrams’
works are in the New York Museum
of Modern Art, The National Art
Gallery, and the Victoria and Al-
bert Museum. Following the dis-
play, reproductions will be made
available for $35 each. Those in-
terested are requested to contact
Professor Douglas Houchens at
Davidson 3831.

to this year's approach.

The cross-section of students
taking the course is wide, and the
decided break from the traditional
concept of math has puzzled some.
However, as a whole, student reac-
tion has been enthusiastic.

STUDY OF LOGIC

A general study of mathematical
logic began the semester. Pene-
tration into such phases of mathe-
matics as the foundation of the
number system and the anatomy
of the infinite will follow.

Two books comprise the text
material. One of these. Principles
of Mathematies by C. B. Allendorf-
er and C. O. Oakley, is a highly
controversial edition. Both praise
and adverse criticism have ap-
peared in various reviews.

In a final emphasis Dr. McGa-
vock stated, “This is not a history
course in mathematics. The study
jis mathematics, not about it.”

Camera Club Holds
Technique Discussion

On Wednesday night the Camera
Club held its first regular meeting
'in the Green Room of the College
Union. President Hank Daniel led
a discussion on general informa-
tion and hints in the use of flash
photography.

FLASH DISCUSSION

Color slides and prints  illus-
trated many of the important
points and demonstrated how
iflash photography can in some
cases produce better daylight pic-
Itures, Daniel discussed the uses
of both electronic flash and flash-
bulbs and also gave an easy method
for applying the flash guide num-
bers to films of varied speeds.

This year, as in the past, the
Club has a special arrangement
with a nearby camera store so
that members can buy supplies at
a 20 per cent discount. This dis-
count will also be a great help
to the Club if it decides to add to
its already well equipped dark-
room.

MEMBERSHIP

“The Club is for people who
are interested in photography, not
necessarily for the pros,” empha-
sized Daniel to all who may want
to join. “You don’t need an ex-
pensive camera either.” ;

He also pointed out that mem-
bers can find interest in the bi-
weekly meetings even if they don't
take pictures. At each of these
meetings a member presents a
program on the general topic of
photography.

OFFICERS

Other than Daniel, president this
year, officers of the Club are
Fairman Cumming, the secretary-
treasurer, and Dr. Howard French,
the faculty adviser.

GIRLS TAKE OVER DORM

Freshman C

ouncil Plans

Belk Room Reservations

Under the supervision of its president, Kenny Pless,

the Freshman Council is han
Belk Dormitory for the girls

dling reservations for beds in
who are attending the Home-

coming festivities here October 26-28.

Students living in Belk had until
eleven o'clock last night to exer-
cise their priority in room assign-
ments. There is a one dollar de-
posit on each reservation, to make
sure that no one will reserve his
room just to keep the girls out.
After Homecoming, the deposits
will be returned to those who
actually had girls staying in Belk.

All residents of Belk must be
out of their rooms by 2 p.m. Fri-
day October 26, and may return
by 2 p.m. Sunday October 28.

There are approximately 325 stu-
dents living in Belk, and it will
be up to them to make arrange-
ments for staying elsewhere during
the weekend. As usual, janitors
will be able, upon request, to set up
extra beds in the other dormitor-

ies.

There will be no curfews for the
girls, and chaperones will be sta-
tioned at each of the floors at the
center stairway to call the girls
for their dates. Also, if three stu-
dents particularly want three girls
to say together, a third bed may
be put in the room.

Bunny Perkinson, president of
the Interfraternity Council, which
is responsible for the room reser-
vatiotts, commented, “Juding by
the number of flowers sold, this
should be one of the largest num-
ber of girls to invade the campus
in quite some time.”

The IFC decided this year to
handle the reservations through
the Freshman Council,

STUDENT BODY POLL
FAVORS IKE BY A
LANDSLIDE VOTE ~

The Davidson College student
body favors President Dwight
Eisenhower for re-election over
Adlai Stevenson, by more than a
two-to-one majority.

In an October 11 poll of the
student body, 637 ballots showed
that the Republican Party received
a majority of 68.9%, followed by
the Democrats, Independent Elec-
tors (in South Carolina) and sev-
eral scattered votes.

The breakdown is as follows:

Per
No. Cent
Republican 439 68.9
Democrat 184 28.9%.
Independent 9 0.1%
Others § 0.1%.
Total 637 100%

The Independent Electors are a
group of South Carolinans pledged
to neither Eisenhower nor Steven-
son. On Tuesday of this week, they
decided to support Senator Harry
F. Byrd (Dem. Va.) for President.
The purpose: of the independent
movement is to throw the election
into the House of Representatives,
depending, of course, on a close
electorial vote, whereby neither
party gets a majority of the elec-
toral votes.

Candidates in the group listed as
“others” included Patereski.
(Socialist) Talmadge, Pogo Possum,
and the States’. Rights party head-

New York production of Shaw's
“Caesar and Cleopatra” with Sir
Cedric Hardwicke and Lilli Palm-
er. The next season saw him again
in a Shaw play, the ANTA produc-
tion of “Getting Married’. Almost
every summer, he. takes a swing
round the summer ‘theatre circuit.
Television frequently claims his
talents for comedy
with such top-flight stars as Milton
Berle, Victor Borge, and Bob Hope.

READINGS

Mr. Treacher will read from the
works of such noted humorists as
A.P. Herbert. O. Henry, and P. G.
Wodehouse for a progftam of

Berryhill Outlines

year on Wednesday evening. Dr.
W. Reece Berryhill. Dean of the
University of North Carolina
School of Medicine, spoke on
“Undergraduate Preparation for
Medicine.”

Dr. Berryhill stated that there
are three questions that must be
answered by the undergraduate
who has medicine in mind as a
career. The first of these is “Why
are you Interested in medicine as
a career?” The undergraduate who
enters without having a= strong
motivation to study medicine wil!
experience frustration if he is not
absolutely certain that it will be
the best possible voeation for him.

Secondly, the undergraduate
student must ask himself, “Do you
kiow what medicine is?” Medicine
has broadened to include general
pcaectice, teaching and research.
trore than two dozen specialties,
und administrative medicine, which
ircludes such fields as. hospital ad-
ninis(ration and public health.

PREPARATION

Third, and most important, he
must ask, “Do you know what your
undergraduate work must prepare
yeu for?” Undergraduate training
should give you the best. possible
general education.

There are two aspects to gen-
cral preparation. Scholastic pre-
paration, the first of the two, is
limited to four years.

Dr. Berryhill emphasized here
that medicine is a social science as
welJ as a biological science. The
good physician must be able to

Political Emphasis Week

Discuss Pressing Ethical
Problems Facing Nation

By HAROLD SMITH

Highlighting the Y.M.C.A.

Political Emphasis Week will

will be the appearance and speeches of Morris Abram and
Mayne Albright, esteemed political figures of the South on

Thursday, Oct. 25.

‘Mr. Abram and Albright will be
introduced to Davidson students at
Thursday Chapel during which they
wilt deliver brief speeches treating
the major aspects of “Religious
Ethics in Politics,” this year’s
theme of the “Y” program.

Mr. Abram, a Democrat, is pre-
sently practicing law in Atlanta.
He was a contender in 1952 for
the Atlanta District seat in the
National Congress. He obtained his
{education from the University of
Georgia from which he graduated
summa cum laude and was grant-
ed a Rhodes Scholarship.

His experience in politics, both
at state and national levels and his
ethical approach to the realm of
politics, qualify him admirably to
join with Mr. Albright in being a
principal around which the politi-
cal program has been devised.

ALSO A DEMOCRAT

Mayne Albright, a native North
Carolinian, is an attorney in Ra-
leigh, and, like Abram, is aligned
Democraticully, In 1948 he carried
on a vigorous campaign for Gov-
ernor of the state. Accompanied by
his wife, he stumped the state in
his campaign trailer, “the Chal-
lenger,” and visited the entire one
hundred counties. He attended the

-| University of North Carolina and

was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He
was president of the student body
and state wrestling champion.

LAW PRACTICE

In 1936 he was admitted to the
Bar, and in the same year became
the youngest state Employment
