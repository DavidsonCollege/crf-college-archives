HOW ARE YOU RUNNING?

The goal lies before you, Examina-
tions are only thirty working days off.
Then after ten days of testing we will
cross the line. How will it be? Will
it be at the rate of a hundred. eighty,
sixty per or will it be that some one will
have to drag us off uf the field.

These coming days will be the most
trying of the whole course. Tt will be
necessary for us to buckle down to a
steady: stride from now until we cross
the mark, ifs we hope to cross it ata
rate above sixty per. “There will be
more than one obstacle to hinder us in
this race for promotion and the skin.
May be it will be our own lazy selves
that will hold us back? Mav be those
“sweet things” with large eves and small
hands? May be the peanut parcher or
the green bench in) some shady nook?
Whatever it is it will be necessary for
us to pledge ourselves against it for
these coming days, if we ever hope to
win,

The warm days are coming and the
southern winds are going to make even
the most energetic lazy to some extent.
It is human that they should, but it is
no excuse for either them or you to lay
down on the job,

There is a time for everything.
there is even a time for loafing By no
matter of means should any che let
studying or anything come in to take up
this time which you should be—just_rest-
ing. But when the time of studying
comes the time for loafing has passed by
and as studving should not interfere
with our loafing neither should our loaf-
ing interfere with our studying.

The folks back home are on the side-
lines pulling for you. Vhey are inter-
ested in every move and are anxiously
waiting the day when you shall cross
the line in the lead. Now is not the
time to let up: For none of us want to
disappoint those back home.

has completely gone.”

read my assignment for today, and he
told me the next time I didn’t do mv
work he was going to give me a piece of
his mind.”-—Widow.

Uncle Josh said some time ago: “Give
every fellow you meet the time of day
and half the road. If two or three doses
of that kind of medicine fails to make
him civil and kind, don’t waste any more
ammunition to pump politeness into a
fool.” Davidon is very fortunate in
having very few incurables of this type.
“Hello! Gentlemen. How is it this
morning?” has long been the custom on
our campus. May it never cease.

“To cheer together in perfect time at
the call of the cheer leader is a college
education in itself,” some one has said.
At that rate we are a far way from be-
ing’ educated, °

other sign of a prosperous baseball sea-

LET US GET RERIND THE TEAM.

Baseball season is here. ‘Whe schedule

‘in Charlotte. “The team needs every
mother’s son of us there to back them!
up. Will we be there to help them over
the fatal seventh? Or will it be a repe-
tition of former seasons when no one
but the cheer leader and a few faithfuls
did all the cheering and showed that
the Davidson bleachers were not. en-
tirely dead ?

Many have said that the: Davidson
crowd could not yell. “Vhat might have
been true in the past, but it will not be
in the future. Davidson can yell and
she has as much pep as the next. college,
if she would only get down and prac-
tice as the teams which she sends off
her campus every year to spread her
name thriout the South,

One of the most inspiring features at
the games between the larger colleges
of our country is the cheering. One sec-
tion of the bleachers strives with an-
other to see which has the best: lungs.
And if you ever noticed it the spirit of
those fellows was as contagious as it
could be, for before long you were in it
yelling as big as the next one. Between
the halves or while the teams are chang-
ings sides the leader starts up a song and
everyone picks i it up. How can you keep
out of it? There is no way on earth
unless you leave. When the game is
over and just before the crowds leave,
the band plays “Alma Mater.” Every
one stands and bares. his head while
everybody joins in and sings.

Our “Alma Mater” goes like this:

(1)
College ‘ties can ne'er be broken,
Formed at old D.C,
Far surpassing wealth unspoken
They’ IL forever be.
Chorus:
D. C.. D. C.. Hail to thee,
Thow hast been kind to us;
Ever shall-we cherish thee
With thoughts of love and trust.
(2)
When our college days are over,
And our way shall part,
Still in thee we'll be united,
Still be one in heart.
Chorus:

Let us learn it and back Amo and
the team up at the next game on Mon-
day.

PROFESSIONAL EFFICIENCY.
In his charming poem, “The Vain

King.” Henry Van Dyke tells of a man
who wanted to do everything well. He
desired to excel everybody else in his
kingdom at every particular point. He

wanted to be the center of every pic-
ture, and he ended by being the center

music, which instrument would you

would like to be a soloist on a cash
register.”"—Philadelphia Record.

Baseball News of Past Week.

Practice during the first part of last
week was hindered greatly by the cold
weather. Further developments of the
hit and run were demonstrated in the
system of hitting three times and run-
ning around the track.

“Christy” Christenbury, the old Da-
vidson star, has reported to the Atlanta
ball club and seems to be one of their
best bets for the infield.

“Doc” McConnell has instituted a
‘good substitute for rainy weather, ball
in the old commencement hall. In the
recent game between the “Phillies and
the Wildcats” Doc and Cop Johnson
showed rare form.

The Oak Ridge team certainly must
have had a hilarious time in their recent
visit to Davidson. Several of them were
interested spectators at the indoor game
held in the gym under the management
of “Christy Mathewson” Lane.

The one hit a game average is hardly
sufficient to win a ball game. The past
two Saturdays have impressed this on
us rather forcibly.

on the athletic field) Monday morning
when voung Dick Grey carried away the
honors in the Boy Scout field meet. He
won the broad jump, hundred yard dash,

two his brother holds the college record,
and he has set Gut to raise them when
his chance comes.

Every afternoon, rain or shine, finds

acquired a new glove and hall besides

and he did nothing really well.

If a man is going to attain profes-
sional efficiency, he must have one pro-
fession and not several. He must not
waste brain and brawn in the endeavor
to have a number of life works. He
must find his line of ability, and then
he must continually say, ‘This one thing

“Well, I've beaten all records this

“In what?”

“Why, I've lived on an apple a day

“Well, that's nothing; I’ve jived on
earth for 35 years!”
