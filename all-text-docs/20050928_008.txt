‘Uncle Tom's Cabin’ deemed offensive, banned from class"

After an_ interdepartmental
meeting last Wednesday, the
English department has decided to
discontinue the reading of the
novel “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” by
Harriet Beecher Stowe in English
classes at Davidson. The decision
was unanimous.

Motives behind the decision var-
ied, but the primary concern is that
the book addresses the immoral
institution of slavery.

“Frankly, after a thorough analy-
sis of the book,” said Dr. Edith
Sandusky, Chair of the English
department, “we can’t believe
it was published in the first
place. Not only does it por-
tray the horrific practice of
slavery, but the entire book
is based upon these social
inequities.”

The professors feel that
ideas and images present-
ed in the novel perpetuated
many stereotypes left over
from the slavery periods of
American history, such as the
inequality of minorities.

Some faculty members were
upset about the graphic nature of
some parts of the novel. There are
scenes in which slaves are
beaten, sexually abused, and
even murdered.

“I don’t think the depiction of
such violence and irresponsible
behavior is something that needs
to be taught in the classroom,”
stated English professor Dr. Lisa
Rowe. “It’s something you see way
too much of in television and
movies already I don’t think we
need to reinforce it again in an aca-

demic setting. Violence shouldn’t
be an educational matter; it may
encourage others to imitate such
actions.”

Others were disturbed by the
novel’s normalization of the prac-
tice of slavery.

“Stowe presents an environment
where slavery is just ‘an everyday
occurrence’,” Dr. Phillip Moore of
the Sociology department said.

“The novel’s setting describes a
reality that is less than ideal, which
is unacceptable. Some of the char-
acters in the novel not only didn’t
protest acts of slavery, but were
also slaveowners themselves. I
completely disagree with them.”
Dr. Cathy Skype of the English
department was surprised it was

allowed to publish even during the
period when slavery was an estab-
lished institution.

“In order for her work to have
been inoffensive and effective,
Stowe should have pretended that
the problem of slavery simply did-
n't exist, thus successfully remov-
ing the whole concept from the
public consciousness.”

Dr. Henry Waters of the English
department was less critical of the
work, but was still in favor of ban-
ning the book.

“I understand Stowe’s intention
was to be critical of the institu-
tion of slavery,” he said, “but
she didn’t make the slave own-
ers evil enough. Simon
Legree, for example, could,
in addition to being irreli-
gious and sexually abusing
his slaves, also have had
shifty eyes and plans of
world conquest, so that stu-,
dents could be
sure his behavior

the decision, commented, “I had
always interpreted that book as
promoting slavery since that’s
what it was all about, and some of
the main characters were slave
owners.”

Steve Palmer ’09 was also happy
he won’t have to read the book in
any of his classes.

“Unlike in most English classes,
when I read ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’ I
didn’t find myself giggling over
existentialist philosophies or the
boy quiz in the new issue of Teen
People,” he said. “Instead, I was
appalled to find a book full of
racial inequalities and violence.”

A few students have protested
the disbarring, claiming it
amounts to censorship and goes
against the foundations of a liberal
arts education.

In response to these outcries,
Sandusky remarked, “It is the onus
of a professor to impose his or her

personal

Dr. Rita Younger,
also of the English
department, offered

a similar inter-

pretation of the

novel.

that we find

Most students, as well, were in
favor of the banning of the book.

Davidson administration has cre-

become a major annoyance for

Student outcry over the decision
has been strong, as many under-
graduates use Chambers class-

‘rooms to relax and unwind after a

long day of going to class.

The large video projectors were
enjoyed by many students who
either do not own proper film
equipment, or do not own one that

have found that -

is as nice.

“Watching movies in Chambers
was one of my favorite things to
do,” said Rachel Molson ’o7. “The
screens are way bigger than the 17-
inch television I have in my room.
Also, sometimes I like to stand at
the front of the classroom and pre-
tend that I’m a teacher.”

Some students plan on spending
their movie-watching time at the
Union or in their rooms, while
other students have decided to go
about their business as if nothing
had changed.

Along with movie viewing in
Chambers, numerous student
activities fall under the official des-
ignation of “other.”

Mayfield listed some behavior of
primary concern as obnoxiously
cheering at sporting events or pref-
acing all in-class statements with
what you do in your home state.

Mayfield believes that his policy
changes are already having an
effect on the student body.

“I like to work from the ground
level to implement my regulations.
If I see a student doing something
I don’t like, I just walk up to them
and say, ‘Hey, stop it.”

‘Uncle Tom’s
Cabin’ presents a normalized real-
ity containing social inequalities
based on something as arbitrary as
race, we feel it should neither be
read nor discussed in an academic
setting.”
