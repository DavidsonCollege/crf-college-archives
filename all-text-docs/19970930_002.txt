Haselden proposes
committee on minors

By JENNY Hapcoop
Staff Writer

Foster Haselden presented a reso-
lution to the SGA Tuesday night, suc-
cessfully forming an ad-hoc committee
to research the possibility of bringing
minors to all of the College’s 20 aca-
demic departments.

Only eight departments currently
offer minors to students. Haselden, a
‘sophomore, hopes to make minors an
option in the other 12 departments.

Haselden, also involved with the
Elections Committee and the Student
Advisory Council to the Director of
Auxiliary services, brings much enthu-
siasm to the ad-hoc committee.

He began his project last year after
students continually questioned him
about the absence of minors within the
departments. Even though he is not

planning on pursuing a minor himself,
Haselden is beginning the research nec-
essary to eventually instate new mi-
nors.

In the near future, Haselden will
distribute a survey to the student body
asking students which minors they think
the College should offer.

As of now, “minors at Davidson
have been ambiguous because some
have. tried and some have failed,”
Haselden said in a recent interview.

With the information from the sur-
veys, he will be able to comprise a list of
minors to present to the departments.

Haselden will also research other
comparable colleges and their minors,
and present a petition to the committee.

Haselden plans to submit the data
and the petition to the Council of Aca-
demic Affairs and ask them to formally
establish the minors.

Martin renovations improve
research opportunities

By Emity RICKERS
Staff Writer

The Martin Chemistry building re-
ceived the second major renovation in
its history this summer, a development
which is expected to improve opportu-
nities for chemical research at Davidson.

The $1.2-million project upgraded
lab space for class work and installed
individual student-faculty research labs.

Renovation was concentrated on
the second floor of Martin. Fume hoods
were installed in the organic lab to in-
crease ventilation and improve safety
conditions for students. A prep room
next door provides space for instructors
and students to conduct pre-lab work,
and an instrument lab will house com-
puterized instruments used to analyze
lab results.

Faculty labs in the south wing will
be used all year by instructors and small
teams of students conducting research.
The Experimental Techniques course,
required of all chemistry majors, will be
conducted in the remodeled lab and
storage space at the south end of the

building.

A new fire alarm system was also
installed.

Money for the renovation came
from the National Science Foundation
— which awarded the college a
$400,000 “matching funds” grant — as
well as donors’ pledges.

Felix Carroll, chair of the chemis-
try department, explained that it was
“not just a matter of applying for and
getting [the grant]. We had to demon-
strate that the money would be used to
expand our capacity for teaching and
research. It was very competitive.”

Part of the grant will be used to
purchase a gas chromatograph-mass
spectrometer, a highly sensitive instru-
ment which separates unknown chemi-
cal compounds or mixtures and enables
students to identify them by analyzing
the remains.

Carroll believes that Davidson’s
reputation for this type of hands-on
instruction contributed to winning the
grant.

“The record of our graduates and
the number of Ph.D. candidates who go

on to work at other institutions around
the country certainly helped,” he said.
“But the strong tradition of student in-
volvement in research is what sets us
apart.”

Students in the department agree.
Senior chemistry major Andrew Coates,
says the technological upgrading in the
new labs will “show students the mod-
ern techniques that are being used and
explored in grad schools and upper-
level study.”

The new equipment will reduce
the number of “dry labs” that students
conduct, in which they are given hypo-
thetical results of an instrument’ s analy-
sis.

“Now students can analyze their
own data,” Coates said. “It willhelp put
a little more reality into the experi-
ence.”

Future students “will have a much
easier time,” classmate Shannon Forbes
predicted.

“The better equipment will yield
more accurate results, and there are new
labs they can do that we didn’t get to
do.”

New professor enjoying return to
alma mater to teach psychology

By Davip KANG
Staff Writer

Paul Marciano is sharing his love
of psychology with the students of
Davidson.

Originally from Three Bridges,

Marciano graduated from
Davidson in 1988. He returns to his
alma mater after six years of graduate
studies at Yale, where he earned two
master’s degrees and a Ph.D in clinical
psychology.

“It was really a goal of mine that I
had all along,” Marciano said when
asked about returning to Davidson. “I
had such a wonderful experience here
as a studentin my relationships with the
faculty and the kind of attention I got
from them.”

Although this is his first full-time
teaching position, Marciano has exten-
sive experience in the research and prac-
tical applications of psychology. Be-
fore heading to Yale, Marciano assisted
Cole Barton, a Davidson psychology
professor, with a study on missing and
exploited children. They examined the
psychological effects of both stranger
and family abduction on a children and
their families.

While at Yale, Marciano pursued
his interest in developmental psycho-
‘pathology while strengthening his spe-
cialization in parenting skills. This
field, which involves the disorders of

children, led to extensive work with
children who were identified as having
serious behavioral problems.

“T did some of that kind of group
parenting work at the Presbyterian

@ Professor Paul Marciano

church I was in up-at Yale,”’ Marciano
said, “so I hope to.be able to do that in
this community as well. I think itis very
hands-on and it really seemed to make
a difference.”

Marciano is teaching abnormal
psychology and statistics this semester.
His one-year position as Barton’s sab-

batical replacement has not allowed for
many research plans involving students.
But Marciano makes the best of it by
lending his expertise to seniors who are
working on their theses.

“I saw what it was like at Yale,”
Marciano said, “where the classes were
150 students. That is small compared to
alot of large universities. Not getting to
know students’ names or anything about
them, that’s just not what my idea of
being a professor is about.

“Having the opportunity to teach
at a small liberal arts college was a first
choice for me. To kind of come home
to Davidson where I felt comfortable,
where I knew I was going to be able to
work with smart, motivated students
was just incredibly attractive to me.”

Marciano has found his first few
weeks exciting. His first full-time posi-
tion has brought a great deal of student
interaction. Seeing students “come in
and have a research idea, or a hypoth-
esis that they’ ve generated and thought
about” is something he considers won-
derful about his job and Davidson.

“T also think one of the funnest
parts of my job is when a student thinks
of a problem in a different way than I
have,” Marciano said. “When I learn
something from my students, when |
ask a question to the class and get back
an answer that I haven’t thought of yet.
I really enjoy. working with the stu-
dents.”

‘Town brainstorms development ideas

By Mary LEE
Staff Writer

A two-hour public meeting was
held Thursday night at the Town Hall to
discuss strategic planning for the devel-
opment of the Davidson downtown area.

Tim Keane, town planner, began
the session by stressing the increased
congestion and safety problems brought
to Davidson by recent growth north of
Charlotte.

“Davidson needs to establish a plan
to control the changes brought by
growth,” Keane said. “A plan must be
made that will channel growth to im-
prove the economic state of the town,
while keeping it friendly to pedestrians
and bicyclists.”

With large town maps laid out on
four conference tables, Davidson town
residents, property owners, business
owners, tenants, and other interested
persons brainstormed in.small groups.

Imaginary roads, buildings, and
bike paths were drawn by participants
to fit their different visions of a future
Davidson.

The ideas generated included: a
town trolley, Sadier Square improve-
ments, roundabouts for city intersec-
tions, Town Hall expansion, increased
retail on Main Street and Jackson Street,
more pedestrian crossings, sidewalks,
bicycle paths and racks, additional

Streets to divert traffic from the con- °

gested downtown area, and water foun-
tains.

“The key to positive growth is
hitting a variety of markets,” Keane
said. “That includes students, faculty
and staff, visitors, and locals.”

Specifically, “We want to share
the town more with students,” said Marjo
Williams, a town board member. “The
students add vitality to the town. We
want to get the students talking about
what they want. We thought Ben and
Jerry’s was a real coup, but there needs
to be more. We want the students to
know. how important they are to the
town.”

Ideas from the Thursday meeting
and those contributed by Davidson
merchants will be used to create a town
center design this week. Keane hopes
to have the design completed by Friday.
