Forum gauges student
social satisfaction

By ALLISON DoLpH
Staff Writer

Seventeen people attended the
Social Forum at the Union Outpost
Wednesday evening. Moderated
by sophomore Will Bradshaw, the
forum was an opportunity for stu-
dents to voice their opinions and
suggestions about the state of social
life at Davidson.

Bradshaw invited students to
imagine that they had a “magic
wand” with which they could
change anything about Davidson’s
social life.

He, for example, would like to
see a mammoth playground built
right on campus so that students
could revert back to childhood and
relieve some stress.

The “magic wand” situation
brought many other creative sug-
gestions as well. A 24-hour restau-
rant like [HOP or the Waffle House
right on campus, an alcohol free
dance environment, or a Turkish
bath or massage parlour were a few
of the ideas mentioned.

A tad more realistically, dis-
cussion centered around Charlotte
resources, the Rides program, co-
ed living, alcohol and the Court,
and social opportunities for minori-
ties.

Some students felt that the
college’s selling point of a social
life centered solely on campus was
problematic.

Once at Davidson, students
may rely too heavily on the Court or
the Union and sink quickly into
boredom rather than looking else-
where for fun.

Possible remedies to this limit-
edness include the newly created
Rides program and the idea of a
centrally placed bulletin board pub-
licizing community events.

Other students liked the idea of
having a campus-based social life,
with strong pressure for students to

provide socially for one another.

Optimism was expressed about
next year’s planned coed living, but
some students also felt that coed
living by room should be an option.
Also pertaining to gender relations
were suggestions that freshmen have
same-sex mixers in addition tocoed
mixers. The possibility of increas-
ing interaction between freshmen
and upperclass people was also
raised.

Alcohol and the Court were
hot topics. Several students ex-
pressed concern over the unhealthy
mentality equating drunkeness with
fun.

One student’s “magic wand”
wish. was to abolish the drinking
age on campus so that if you’re a
student, youcan drink. Complaints
about the homogeniety of the Court
were also voiced.

Unfortunately, alcohol policies
may be restricting social functions.
For example, that very afternoon,
the Union had voted by a slim ma-
jority against holding its Spring
Frolics function on the Court: be-
cause of alcohol-related insurance
implications (the event will be held
on Richardson field instead). Al-
lowing minors into 21-year-old
night is also complicated because
of the drinking issue.

In addition, students discussed
the limitedness of social opportuni-
ties for minorities. Certain black
students do not feel welcome on the
“majority-centered” Court, which

only seems to hire alternative bands.
Pleas for a greater variety of music
were registered by minorities as well
as other students: Hip-Hop, Blues,
Gospel, Rap, and even Taoist monk
chants were some of the sugges-
tions.

As new Union Board president
Matthew Hobbie assessed the situ-
ation, “This is a small campus, and
sometimes I think people act like
it’s a big one.”

Craig.Dean, Executive Direc-
tor of the Equal Marriage Rights
Fund, spoke on Monday night
about filing the first discrimina-
‘tion suit to legalize same-sex mar-
riage in almost 30 years. Dean
lives in Washington, D. C. area
with his partner.

Dean is a graduate of
Georgetown University Law
School and has been published in
numerous law journals and news-
papers including the New York
Times.

He has also appeared on sev-
eral television talk shows, includ-
ing “Oprah,” “Phil Donahue,” and
“The Ricki Lake Show.”

“We were one of the first male
couples portrayed on television,”
says Dean of himself and his part-
ner.

“We got thousands of letters
from all over the world. A number
of them were ‘Iam 15, 16, 18. I’ve
seen you on TV, and I now have
hope that I will have a long rela-
tionship one day’,” Dean says. —

Ina world where suicide is the
second largest cause of teenage
death and one-third of teenage sui-
cides are due to sexual orientation
dysfunction, Dean’s affirming
message plays a critical role.

FLAG speaker Dean challenges D.C. law
‘Come out, come out, come out’

Dean told his mother
that “today African
Americans: ride in the
front of buses and it’s a
non-issue. If we take this
step out, then maybe 30
years from now, amother
doesn’t have to be em-
barrassed if her son is
gay. :
“Harvey Milk in
1978 said, ‘Come out and
come to San Francisco,
Come out and come to
New York, Come out and
come to a safe place.’
Twenty years later, we
say, ‘Come out, Come
out, Come out.

Dean originally ap-
plied for a marriage license in D.C.,
getting as far as a blood test before
he was denied. He lost in a 2 to 1
decision from the Court of Appeals
which said that “gay people can
marry, they just have to marry
people of the opposite sex,” says
Dean. t

Although gay and lesbian
couples often participate in a cer-
emonial union, itis not legally bind-
ing. Problems can arise when a gay
or lesbian partner is injured or dies,
with insurance plans, or even in
rental agreements.

' The issue of homosexual mar-

riage rites is especially interesting

- Fund’s message was Dean’s mes-

when gay couples have children.
There are currently 8-10 million
children being raised in 3-4 mil-
lion households with same-sex
parents which means that 6.1% of
American society is made up of
gay/lesbian couples with children.
If one partner with parental rights
dies, the stepparent has no legal
ties to the children.

“The lack of gay/lesbian
couples to marry is a real threat to
the American family,” says Dean.

The Equal Marriage Rights

sage: “Immediate equality now
and anything less is unacceptable.”

Kuykendall, Davidson mayor
Russell Knox, Economics Profes-
sor David Martin and SGA town
liaisons Julie Chevalier and Liz
Boehmler spoke to the Davidson
community organization Common
Ground.

They discussed “The Past,
Present, and Future of Relation-
ships between the town of Davidson
and Davidson College.” Common
Ground meets monthly to discuss
important issues in the town of
Davidson.

Kuykendall spoke about the
evolution of the relationship as the
college has increased in size and as
Charlotte's northward expansion
has made Davidson a more promi-
nent suburb. He addressed long-
term problems that this growth
might engender.

Kuykendall discussed use of
campus facilities by community
members, which he said the col-
lege would be “increasingly reluc-

Last week President John-

Ground focuses on town-gown

tant” to allow as both entities grow.

He also said that he hoped that
the town of Davidson would avoid
“Princetonization,” a trend coined
after Princeton, New Jersey became
a posh suburb of New York and

‘property values rose so high that
Princeton faculty were not able to
live around the university.

In addition to affordable hous-
ing, Kuykendall spoke of the con-
tinuing challenge of providing jobs
for community members.

SGA _ town liaisons Julie
Chevalier and Liz Boehmler spoke
of the need to “build up trust be-
tween the College and the commu-
nity.”

They told the group about vari-
ous service projects in which stu-
dents have been involved and asked
the members of the group to give
them feedback on what community
members think of the College.

“Some [students] don’t give it
a second thought,” said Chevallier,
“but most love the thought of living
inasmall town. We feel honored to
be here.”

Members of the audience ex-

pressed gratitude for student ser-
vice and brought up the issue of
parking. Ruth Pittard, Assistant
Dean of Community Service, said
that if students and community
members could resolve the issue of
parking on Main Street, most town-
gown grievances would be solved.

Knox said the SGA-sponsored
dinner held with the Davidson Board
of Commissioners was one of the
“most productive meetings we have
ever had. We really learned how
students think and what they want.”

He spoke about improvements
in relations in the last few years,
especially among off-campus stu-
dents and town police.

Moderator and town resident
Martin opened discussion with a
series of questions: What groups
will be able to afford living in
Davidson? How do students inter-
act with the town in service, on
Main Street, and in residential “stu-
dent ghettos”? Is the parking prob-
lem solved? All of these questions
were not answered by audience
members, but others were bought

up. Anthropology professor and

town resident Nancy Fairley
brought up the issue of the ethnic
composition of the town. She dis-
cussed the effects of rising taxes
and the small number of African
Americans employed on campus.
“We risk losing that community,”
she said.

Kuykendall commented that
in recruiting African Americans
the college does not have “a very
good record to date, and I don’t
know what the future looks like. It
is an annunciated priority of the
College, but it’s had limited suc-
cess.” The group also discussed
the lack of students shopping on
Main Street, alcohol and drug prob-
lems on campus and in the town,
and options for the town’s teenag-
ers on weekends. As the meeting
ended, Martin asked the group if
they had any other questions or
comments. Blanche Porter, a resi-
dent of Davidson for 79 years,
raised her hand.

“J just wanted to say that I love
the students,” she said. “I like the
way they liven up the town each
fall.”

Montoya wins Watson

ing Latin dance in Spain, Brazil,
and Argentina, fully funded by the
Watson Foundation.

“The Watson offers the chance
of a lifetime to get away fora year,”
says Montoya.

A Political Science major with
a concentration in Ethnic Studies,
Montoya will leave for Spain in
early August. During a six month
stay, he plans to study the Flamenco.
From Spain Montoya will travel to
Brazil to study the Samba for an-
other three months. The final leg of

’ Montoya’s 12 month adventure will

be Argentina where he will study
the Tango.

Montoya, whose father was
Mexican and whose American
mother taught dancing, says that to
him “dance is an important social
tool. It is my tool to get to know the
society and culture of these coun-
tries.”

In addition to social ramifica-
tions, Montoya says differences in
style and tradition of dance even
within Spain itself may be traced to
political influences.

Thirty-two Davidson seniors
submitted initial proposals to the
College’s Watson review commit-
tee. Four students, Randy Hartwell,
Sally Permar, Nathan Summerlin
and Montoya were sent on to the
national selection round, Each was
interviewed for ninety minutes by
the Watson Foundation’s Director
during which time candidates were

_ grilled on their ten-page proposals.

“Tt was the worst interview of
my life. It was very difficult,” says
Montoya. “He had me up and danc-
ing .... He made sure we earned it.”
