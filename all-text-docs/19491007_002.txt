No More Chapel
Editorials

Since the days of Davidson’s birth—back
even to the era during which the great
Nev roamed the Mecklenburg woods in
search of a quiet nook. where he could de-
sign a seal in peace—chapel editorials have
been appearing with unrelenting regulari-
ty' on the second page of The Davidsonian.

Their theme is always the same—the mes-
sage they usually attemp to convey is the
same—in fact, and this is one of David-
son’s secret -trudition's Herein brought to
light for the first time—it’s generally the
same editorial. Each year in the Spring,
the old and new editors of The Davidsonian
meet under the tower in the dead of night
and a sealed packet changes hands. The
seal is not to be broken until the twenty-
third of September the following Fall—at
which time, and at six-week intervals there-
after, it is published in this space under the
heading *‘Chapel Conduct.”’

Yesterday, however, when the packet
was opened—in a locked and darkened room,
of course—it was discovered to our hor-
ror that the time worn manuscript was
missing. It seems that the editorial staff of
Carolina's Tar Heel, having heard of the
powerful effect the old and treasured edi-
torial exerted on the Davidson student body,
had sent agents to the Hill with orders to
return with the priceless piece of journal-
ism or not at all. In spite of our constant
vigilance, they somehow succeeded. Doubt-
lessly the conduct at Carolina will improve
overnight.

Now, that we have no editorial to print
on the Davidson students’ disgraceful chapel

conduct, ‘the only hope left us is that there
will never be any need for one.

Rush Week

While Rush Week is fresh in our minds,
doubtless many of us are thinking how it
could be improved and how it compares to
those of years past. I think that with the
system we are now using it was one of the
best rush period in the last four years. I
think the committee that discussed and
planned it is to be congratulated for a good
job. Also, to Bill Bird who executed the plans
and kept things going smoothly goes a vote
of thanks from the student body.

As I stated above, I think this has been
one of the best if not the best rush periods
we have had in the last four years. The
rushees had three days in which they could
meet the various fraternities and not be
bothered about making a decision as to which
fraternity he would join, although he was
considering the merits of each. Then he had
two days in which to think about the frater-
nities and which ones he liked, ete. During
this time he was not or was not supposed to
be approached by fraternity men. This gave
the rushees plenty of time to discuss it
among themselves and come to some con-
clusions about the various fraternities.

Also these first three days left the rushee
and.the fraternity men the afternoons to
‘study, something which has not been done
in the past.

After the week-end, the two days of
rushing included informal” bidding, which
gave to those men who had made up their
minds about the fraternities, an opportunity
to join the group he liked best. However,
this also brought on the -evil of ‘‘hot box:
ing,’’ which is definitely andesirable. How-
ever, it was repeatedly emphasized to the
freshmen that they had until the day of
acceptance to accept or reject a bid; that
the bid was standing until the day of ac-
ceptance: and for each freshman to look at
as many fraternities as possible and then
carefully make his choice, when extended a
bid.

After the two days of informal rush-
ing, the freshmen had two more days to
think and make up their minds as to which
group they would like to ally themselves.
According to interfraternity agreement, the
rushees were not to be approached about
fraternities during this time. Never before
have the freshmen had so much time in
which to consider a decision.

However, the problem of ‘‘bot boxing”
is one that is not easily met. It is also one

- of the more undesirable problems connected
with rush week on any college campus.
Actually a boy should be able to say that he
would like a little more time in which to
make up his niind, and yet I can see where
this might be rather difficult in some cases.

In view of the above, I think we can
say that as far as first semester rushing goen,
we have reached one of the better plans for
rush week. However, there remains another
alternative, which as yet remains untried—
that of second semester rushing. It seems
that several of the larger universities use
this system to good advantage. How this
would work at Davidson, has often been
speculated, but has never been tried. The
primary argument in favor of such a sys-
tem, is that it gives you one entire semester
in which to get to know the incoming fresh-
men and for them to get to know the up-
perclassmen. This woald allow the fraterni-
ties more ably to pick the men they wanted
and the rushees to choose the fraternity of
which they would like to be a member.

One of the obvious defects of such a
system is that the weaker fraternities would
be weakened and the stronger one, stronger.
Another objection is that of dirty rushing.
Whether the dirty rushing that would go on,
is enough to offset the faults of the present
system, is a question for each to decide.
Another point about dirty rushing is that in.
spite of it, the freshman would still have the
opportunity to examine each fraternity.
Whether he would be dissuaded by a group
of individuals who choose to violate an inter-
fraternity agreement, would depend upon
the individual rushee.

We have tried all other alternatives, now
I recommend that a system of second
semester rushing be worked out and tried
for one year. Then the results may be dis-
eussed and compared with rush periods of
former years. Then I think the best system
of fraternity rushing could be determined
and established.

QUEENS AND VIRGINIA GENTLEMEN

During these gold and blue Oc.
tober days, the Davidson student
finds it pleasant to set forth in any

Idirection, and particularly in the
direction of his southern cousins,
the girls at Queens. Last Thurs-
day, I had a double incentive, for
Douglass Southall Freeman was
lecturing that night in Niniss Au-
ditorium. I arrived in time for din-
ner, and must admit that the sur.
roundings seemed far superior to
anything on the Hill. The = girls
were arrayed in their bright-hued
evening dresses; I’ve never seen
them look prettier. Dr. Freeman,
to judge from his lecture, admired
them too; he remarked reproach-
fully on the fact that he was seat-

ed at a stag table at one end of

the dining hall with his back to the
rest of the room.

At 8:15 Niniss was crammed to
the corners. (If our lecture series
were of the same caliber as that
of our neighbors, Chambers might
also be full on such occasions.)
Speaking with humor and with fer-
vor, Dr. Freeman drew parallels
between and morals from the
young manhoods of Washington
and Lee. He praised their unique
self.control in an era in which
young men were expected to sow
their wild oats with abandon; and
in spite of having to make a few
judicious omissions in regard to
Washington, managed an impres-
sive substantiation of his case. At
the same time, he attacked those
who would paint the two as un-
real paragons, and by means . of
description and vivid detail drew
an attractive picture of these Vir-
ginia gentlemen, laying understand-
able emphasis on their attitude
toward the ladies. After lashing
ut, to our great approval, at the
politicians now in command of the
government, “that plague of lo-
custs seeking to devour the pro-
duce of this land,” Dr. Freeman

closed with a plea for moral dis-
cipline as the only training for our
future leaders.

Dr. Freeman's talk was interest.
ing and well delivered, but hardly
as memorable as his books. These
include the four volume, Pulitzer
Prize winning biography, R. E.
Lee, the three volumes of military
history par excellence which com-
prise Lee’s Lieutenants, and Young
Washington, the first two volumes
of what promises to be a definitive
life of our first president. Dr. Free-
man’s ,works are scholarly; they
are also readable. Well-organized
assemblages of facts about their
protagonists, they do not fail to
bring to life the protagonists them-
selves. They combine, so to speak,
the eruilition of John Morley’s
Life of Gladstone and the bril-
liant character drawing of Lytton
Strachey’s Queen Victoria. In
view of this double attainment, it
may not be extravagant to call
their author the greatest living
American biographer. ;

The quality of Dr. Freeman’s
buoks reflects the man. Alert, per-
ceptive, and phenomenally indus-
trious, he has compressed into one
lifetime three careerss dividing his
days between his newspaper, his
radio program, and his writing. By
virtue of varied accomplishments,
achieved through rigid  self-dis-
cipline, D. S. Freeman is a worthy
follower of the great Virginians
he extols. And in one quality at
least, one mark of the true Old
‘Dominion citizen, he is probably
their superior. After the lecture a
pretty brunette went backstage to
speak to him. “Dr. Freeman,” she
said, “the only thing I didn’t like
about your lecture was that you
sat down too soon.”

“My .dear,” affirmed Freeman,
“if you'll sit on the front row next
time I come, 1 promise to talk half
the night.”

Letters To The Editor

Fellow Students:

For many years now the prob-
lem of chapel conduct and the pro.
ceedings of. chapel in general have
been « greai problem not only to
the administration, but also to a
large number of students. Chapel
programs have been carried on in
the most disorderly way imagina-
ble, not only on student days but on
all days, even when there is a
guest speaker with us. This prob-
biem is one of our oldest and one
of our most urgent. Chapel has long
ago lost its practical and religious
value and as I see it, as it is run
now, it is in some way very detri-
mental to our life here at David-
son.

- 1 think that it is wonderful that
we can gather together five times
during the week in one body. It
creates a certain feeling of unity
and closeness that is so much a
‘part of Davidson. I think it is
wonderful that we can take time
out during the day and give thanks
‘to God for Ii his goodness. But I
also think that we are losing all
that this grand opportunity affords
us. .

We are losing a great tradition
of Davidson because we are abus-
ing the ‘privileges granted us. I

have read from time to time and|.

have heard from time to time that

‘

‘something that has been badly

Davidson men are gentlemen. Well,
if the folks that said ‘and wrote
that could sit in chapel on one stu-
dent day, I’m afraid that they
would bz sorely disappointed in
us, and shocked by what took place
before their eyes.

This bedlam on these days is not
something new, but it has been
with us for many years. People
say that it is tradition, I think it is

misnamed.

All of us are guilty and if we
want to alleviate this condition then
it is up to us, the students, to do
something about it. I belicve that
there is a time and place for every-
thing and 1 do not believe that
chapel on any day is the time nor
the place for such displays of dis-
courtesy, thoughtlessness, and
adolescence as is exhibited now.

1 sincerely hope that all who
read this will take to heart what
T have tried to get across in these
few lines. I feel that it is one of
our most urgent and dangerous
problems, and, unless we do some-
thing about it right now, it may
have vast effect on us and David-
son College. Think it over, fellows,
and I feel that you will see the
need for.a new attitude toward
chapel and more orderly conduct.
Sincerely yours,
WHIT COBB.

gross untruth for freshmen at Syra-

men on the Orange totem pole.
University of Kansas

If you are willing to grab the
world by its horns, says one stu-
dent at the University of Kansas,
there is a way other than by get-
ting hitched to find out what the
gal will be like after the ceremony.

The gentleman's opinion is bas-
ed on a year’s experience as house
hoy in a sorority house. As report-
ed in the Daily Kansan, he says
the glamour wears off within two
weeks, after which the girls don’t
bother with lipstick and hairbrush
before breakfast. (You were won.
dering about clothes, too?).

liberty, and orderly government,

explosion. For in the hands of the
Russians it is a pretty fair cer-
tainty that the bomb, once per-
fected by them, will -be turned
to belligerent uses, if they use. it

the United States must admit to
the charge of using the bomb
against Japan, and are still find-
ing it difficult to justify our action
before the eyes of the world, nev-
ertheless, since the war ended we
have expended great efforts to find
some practicable means to turn the
secret of atomic energy to peace-
time uses. It. is doubtful that the
Soviet Union will accompany us in
these efforts.

their new-found knowledge to fur-
ther their own ambitions of world
conquest. From what our authori-
ties can learn. they still have not
perfected the bomb for military
usage. So for a time we can prob-
ably er ect them to use it as a
diplomatic club in the United Na.
tions and in the capitals of Eur-
ope and the Americas. It puts
them on an equal footing with the
United States; they need not fear
us any more.

So what wilt be the long-range
results of Russian possession of
the secret of atomic power? For

one thing, they will begin to aban-
don the diplomatic stalling tactics
that they, have used so ably in the
UN, and the time is probably not
too far distant when they will aban-
don the UN itself. For another
thing, they will begin to take what
they want by force if necessary,
despite the United States and the
Western Nations. In short, the cold
war, the awful period of uncertain.
ty, is drawing to a close.

With all this in mind, our im.
pression is something of a sigh of
relief. The showdown was coming
sometime, but the Russians were
not going to: start anything that
might get out of hand until they
had neutralized the advantage that
the United States had in the atomic
homb, They have now accomplish-
ed that task, and surely our diplo-
mats have not been blind to the
fact that it was just’ a matter of
time unil they would. Now = at
last the suspense is over.

Perhaps the Soviets will see the
folly of an atomic war and will
make some sort of agreement to
outlaw the bomb. If not, they let
us keep our powder dry and brace
ourselves for the terrible conflict
that is coming.

WILSON’S FIRST SPEECH

President Woodrow Wilson’s
first public speech was delivered
‘at Davidson College in 1873. A
freshman, Wilson spoke to a col.
lege literary society on the advan-
tages of a Republican form of gov-
ernment.

paper and another piece of non-
sense from us. It’s always a prob-
lem to decide what to tear apart,

‘but maybe there'll come an idea

before too long.

There’s one we could use on the
exploits of eight young gentlemen
and their experiences, at a local
Center of Culture. It seems that
they were led astray by one man,
Mimi, who taught them the art
of a tantalizing motion of the
lumtar vertebra. They were very
much enlightened azqd saturned
with renewed vigor and purpose.
But this probably wouldn't go over
very big, so we'll forget it.

Then there's the adventures of
the freshman who thought that
the regulations applied to upper-
classmen, and spent two days try-
ing to get a Junior to carry his
laundry. But he soon realized his
‘mistake and apoligized to the
Count of Control. That, however,
probably wouldn’t be accepted very

Or we could look to -the time
when we'll be grandfathers and
speculate on the thrashing we're
going to give State Saturday night.
“Vessiree, I remember that it was
back in 1949 that those Wildcats
really pulled an upset. Let me see,
they tied the Wolf's tail into about
24 knots, and didn’t get a mark
themselves.” You know someone
may think we’re kidding here, but
I sure hope our boys prove you
wrong. But then maybe we'ed bet-
ter wait until Saturday night.

And Salem Day, There could be
something said of how it really
turned out. That maybe the pic.
ture we painted last week was a
little too dark — or was it? We
saw some Queens, and then there
were some who weren't quite
Queens. But all that is kinda old.

Well it doesn’t seem as if we're
going to settle on anything. so
since we've run out of space, we
may a& well quit.
