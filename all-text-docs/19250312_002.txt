Coach Younger Must Build Nine Out
of Veteran Infield and Weak
Pitching Staff

Dark Horse of State

Starting the season of 1925 as the dark
horse of North Carolina, Davidson will open
with two games with Oak Ridge the last of
March and with State College the first day
of April. With one pitcher, a catcher, three
varsity infielders and two outfielders back,
Coach Younger has more than the usual
number of letter men to work with, but far
from first class material.

Of the men who will make the team, none
averaged over the coveted .300 last year,
though Laird, Vance and Captain Covington
were steady hitters, and the two Alford boys
were good in pinches. Several’ valuable men
are up from last year’s Freshman class team.

With Laird the only regular pitcher back
on the Hill, the staff looks from the start to
be weak. Hampton will probably give good
service on the mound, going well for the
Freshmen last season, while Oden and Kim-
brough are in the running.

With the return of Sim Wrenn, backstop
on the 1921 team, quite a bit of scheming to
cover the position was discontinued. Black,
Summers, and Estridge, are all doing work
behind the plate.

Woodman; Frank Alford and Kugler are
the most likely prospects for the initial sack.
There is a great probability that Alford will
be shifted back to the garden if Woodham
can stand the pace at the bat. Kelly's field-
ing is wellnigh perfect, but he is a little weak
at the plate. Alford’s hitting alone will win
him a position in the outfield if he is shifted.

Simpson seems to have second pretty well
sewed up, with Long and Kimbrough, should
he be transferred from the moundsmen, run-
ners-up. Sion Alford is having little trouble
at short, though Glenn is pushing him.

Captain Covington, at third, is showing the
same form that was in evidence all last sea-
son.

In the outfield, Vance at the present time
is the only letter man, though Cox, Walter
Davis and Sparrow are promising recruits.
Pressly and Simpson are also in the outfield
squad. When Flake is off the mound and
Woodham is covering first, ther will be
three letter men available for the outer
gardens, Vance, Laird and Frank Alford.

Coach Younger is sending his team out
upon a much harder schedule than last year,
and already his men are experiencing hard
workouts every afternoon,

Which reminds us that we'll feel a bit bet-

down on that dotted line. Changes are going
on at all schools, Duke University is look-
ing near and far for a good coach. They
say that Big Jim Baldwin is the man that
will land the job.

[Hickory Downed, 48-0 in
Spring Football Clash

Tilson’s Squad Overpowers Fighting
| Eleven from West in Thrilling
Encounter

| Arrowood Looks Great

The annual spring football practice of the
Wildcat squad was ended Saturday with the
defeat of Hickory High School 48-0. The
high school lads were unable to withstand

| the vicious line plunges and off-tackle plays

of the Wildcats and allowed them to push
| over seven touchdowns. The game, despite
the large score, was well fought throughout
and equalled many fall games in thrilling
plays and interest. The team work and co-
ordination of both teams was inspiring in
view of the short time that the teams had
been working.

No individual stars could be picked as
there were numerous substitutions, no Wild-
cat player playing the entire game. The
members of the Fresh eleven showd great
promise and the old men played true to form.
The Freshmen playing well were Arrowood,

McComb, played their usual form and fight.
The touchdowns were made mainly by line
bucks, although one was an intercepted pass,
while another was made on a fumble.

MANY GOOD SCHOOLS ENTER
TRACK MEET

According to Coach Tilson the state-wide
high school track meet to be held at David-
son on March 21, promises to be a great suc-
cess. Already the answers from the various
high schools are coming in expressing their
eagerness to enter the meet. Among those
who have already accepted the invitations ex-
tended to them are Charlotte, Statesville,
Salisbury and Winston-Salem.

Coach Tilson is exerting all his energies
toward making this event a success. The
primary purpose of the meet is to encourage
track here at Davidson and to awaken a new
interest in this branch of athletics. David-
son for the past few years has lagged too far
behind her rivals in this sport, depending too
entirely upon a few individuals doing all the
work while several capable men haven’t in-
terest enough to event go out.

Melton, and Ritchie, while Baker, Black, and

The loving cup that is to be given to the
high school team making the highest total of
points will be a trophy worth competing for.
The Davidson Freshmen will also be eligi-
| ble to enter the meet, but they are not eligi-
| ble to win the cup.

The meet will doubtless begin at 3:00
| o'clock as there will no doubt be a necessity
| for several heats to be run in the dashes and
it will take some time for all the events to
| take place. The following is the list of
| events :

100-yard dash, 220-yard dash, 440-yard
| dash, one-half mile, mile, and two mile, 120
| high hurdles, 220 low hurdles, 12-pound shot
| put, discus, javelin, high jump, broad jump,
| and pole vault.
| The Davidson student body will be hosts

| to the high schools that day.
