DAVIDSON COLLEGE _

President Bobby Vagt respond-

ed this week to two proposals

passed by the Committee on
Campus and Religious Life
(CCRL) last seméster.

Vagt affirmed CCRL’s recom-
mendation to bring a historically
black sorority to Davidson and
agreed to allow Patterson Court
to hold up to four impromptu par-
ties per week.

In December, CCRL voted to
change the alcohol policy so that
the Court could hold up to seven
impromptus. Vagt said that his
decision to allow four impromp-
tus was not meant to undermine
CCRL’s proposal.

“Fating houses never request
parties, so we’re only talking
about fraternities,” Vagt said.
“We'll double the number and
then look.”

Vagt approves sorority,

increases impromptu limit

Vagt approved the sorority pro-
posal because he believes the
sorority is “an important social
construct in support of members
of this campus community.”

He said his decision was also
influenced by the “virtually
unanimous support” from. cam-

pus organizations, alumni
groups, and the Board of
Trustees.

Because historically black
sororities are primarily service
organizations, Vagt does not
believe the decision will set a
precedent for future sorority ini-
tiatives.

The process for choosing a
sorority will begin immediately
and will be led by Patterson
Court advisor Joy Hamm.

Bean Bag Series
gets mixed reviews

By Lex! HAMILTON & EMILY KOTA

News Editor &
Senior Staff Writer

New members of Patterson
Court organizations are concerned
about the effectiveness of the Bean
Bag Education Series, prompting
senior members of Court organiza-
tion to make inquiries into the pro-
gram’s purpose.

The 2006 Series began with a “1
in 4” rape awareness event for
males and “Legally Blonde” for
females on January 24.

Tyler Stone ’09 and Bobby Mohr
°09 felt a bit uncomfortable with
the graphic nature of the “1 in 4”

program. Stone, however, recog-
nized the value of the program.
“I’m glad it forced me out of my
comfort zone,” Stone said. “Rape
is a serious issue, and to fully get
the message, you need to be pushed
a little. I respect those guys a lot for
their work and their commitment.”
Though not required to do so by
his organization, Phi Delta Gamma
member Anders Wells ’08 attended
the “1 in 4” lecture. Wells believes
that “many men are uncertain
about the definition of rape.”
“This is an important issue for
men and women,” Wells said, “and

Admissions releases ED I numbers

By AMELIA RICHMOND
Staff Writer

The Office of Admission and
Financial Aid saw a drop in stu-
dents applying Early Decision, a
binding application option that
requires students to attend
Davidson if they are accepted.

This year, 357 students applied
under Davidson’s Early Decision I
and Early Decision II plans com-
pared to last year’s 440. The num-
ber of international applicants is
also down.

Of the 250 students who applied

by the November 15 Early.
Decision I deadline, 143 were
accepted.

According to President Bobby
Vagt, the college is not seeking to
admit fewer applicants but rather to
recruit students who are likely to
come to Davidson.

“We’re paying more attention to
folks who ought to be here instead

of the game of accepting fewer stu-
dents this year than last,” Vagt said.

This week, the Admissions
Office will mail notification letters
to students who applied Early
Decision II.

One hundred and seven students
submitted their applications by
January 2 under this College’s final
early application option. The dead-
line for all regular admission appli-
cations also passed on that date.

The number of students accepted
from Early Decision II will be
available next week.

Senior Associate Dean of
Admission and Financial Aid
Wookie Payne said the Office of
Admission is currently finishing
the applications.

“As always, we are shaping a
class that we hope provides depth
and breath of interest, experience,
ideas, intellect, talent and passion,”
Payne said.

Because the admissions process

is not yet complete, the Office
Admissions cannot provide a com-
plete list of applicants’ distinguish-
ing qualities.

Vagt said fewer foreign students
applied this, year because the
Admissions Office did not send out
representatives on global recruiting
trips.

Regular admission invitations
will be sent out by the end of
March. Accepted students must
decide whether to attend Davidson
by May I.

iThe class of 2010 is expected to
have between 450 to 460 students,
the same number targeted for last
year’s incoming freshman class.
The Admissions Office expects to
fill the 450 spots by sending out
1,100 invitations.

The Admissions Office will
sponsor Decision Davidson, which
allows admitted students to visit
Davidson before finalizing their
college plans., on April 8.
