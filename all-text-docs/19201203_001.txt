Initial Presentation of Wildcat
Minstrels a Marked Success

In Spite

of Torrential Downpour Students Play to a Packed House—Prof.

Erwin Deserves Great Credit for His Work as Di-
rector—-Many Visitors Present

Wildcat Minstrels! One of the greatest

dramatic successes ever

shown in Davidson was the Wildcat Minstrel Show which made its bow

before a packed house on last Saturday
is indeed entering a new era when suc

night in Shearer Hall. Davidson
delightful and entertaining pro-

grammes as that presented, comes to take the place of the commonplace,

time-worn Senior Speaking.

The features of the occasion were the
varied musical numbers which were pre-
sented in such excellent style and finish.

The curtain rose promptly at 8 o'clock,
opening with the Grand Minstrels, which
was the first number. Carl H. Long, of
Winston-Salem, was the interlocutor,
and expressed very ably the dignity gen-
erally attached to that office. In direct
contrast were the ludicrous sights as
presented by the five gaily bedecked end
men. Fred Thompson, Bilt Bogert, Cop
Johnson, Bill Carr, and Bob McLeod
took care of the humorous part with
great style.

At convenient intervals between jokes,
songs were interspersed with great ef-
fectiveness. “That Colored Jazzboray,”
sung by Frank Law, supported by the
chorus, made a big hit with the audience.

Carl J. Matthews, the John McCor-
mick of the college, gave the well-known
love lyric, “For You Alone.”

Fred Thompson just had to sing of the
“Blues My Naughty Sweetie Gave to
Me,” and o0-00-oo—they were some
blues!

The Wildcat Quartette, consisting of
Bill Car, Frank Law, Ted Jones, and
Charlie Vance, gave some typical negro
“close harmony” selections of the bones
and moon variety.

_A. V. Gibson resurrected some old ne-
gro plantation ballads and made his
banjo fairly hoop out their melodies.

The first act ended when Bill Bogert

This Year’s Eleven Re-
flects Credit on Davidson

In Spite of S.LA. A. Rolings and
Injuries, Coach Grey's Men
Make Excellent Record

The Wildcat football season which has
just closed, has brought much honor up-
on the fair name which Davidson holds
in Southern football circles. The eleven
stacked up against the strongest teams
of Virginia, North Carolina, South Caro-
lina and Georgia. A creditable showing
was made in every game, with the pos-
sible exception of the Georgia Tech
affair, where Coach Grey was forced to
use second and third string men in his
backfield. *

The team won five and lost five. Three
of the games lost were by 7 lone points,
showing that a terrific fight was put up
to the last ditch. In two of these games,
four of the cogs of the Red and Black
machine were missing because of the
S L A. A. rulings which disqualified
four Varsity performers.

The season opened up with the three
hardest games of the schedule. In the
opening game at Riddick Filed in Ra-
leigh, Coach Bill Fetzer’s lads from N. C.
State got away with a 23 to o victory.
Next week the team journeyed up to

Wh

Famous Explorer to Be

Students Fortunate in Opportunity
to Hear Samuel Phillips Verner

Davidson College and community are
to have an address on December 6th
by Samuel Phillips Verner, the veteran
American explorer of the African and
American Tropics, scientist, sanitarian,
author, and business administrator.

Mr. Verner has made four expeditions
to Central Africa. On the first, he car-
ried help to Dr. Sheppard, the Presbyte-
rian missionary at Luebo on the Kasai
River, and then explored the Upper
Kasai, making known to the world the
famous Bakuba king, Ndombe, discover-
ing a settlement of the pygmics, was
nearly killed by a fall into a game pit,
suffered forty attacks of malarial fever,
and barely escaped being killed by savage
Baschilele. On the second, he brought
a group of the pygmies to America, the

Red and Black

“Drive it over, Wildcats!” “How much time left?” “Give it to Be-
thea!” These and similar entreaties came from the 50 loyal Davidson
students who journeyed to Greenville on Turkey Day to see the “Hurri-

cane” battle the “Wildcats.”

At the end of two and a half hours of hard

fighting the Purple and White came off the field victorious for the first
time in the history of the two schools,

B. W. Romefelt Named

Election Held at Banquet in Green-
ville Following Farman Game

A very suceessful football season for
the Red and Black machine was fitting-
ly closed with a delightful Thanksgiving
banquet at The Imperial Hotel, Green-
ville, S. C., on last Thursday evening at
7 o'clock.

The guests of the Athletic Association
consisting of all the members of the
football team and about ten honored
guests among whom were Dr. and Mrs.
J. M. Douglas, Miss Blake, of Green-
wood, S. C,, Misses Sarah Miller and
Evelyn Connell, of Converse College, and
other charming ladies gathered around
a well appointed and appropriately dec-
orated banqueting table. Covwers were
laid for 36 guests. The gathering was
made up of a very merry crowd and was
in keeping with the holiday spirit
throughout. f

After a delicious nine course dinner
was served, toasts were responded to
by all of the football men, who reviewed
the happenings of the past season, ap-
parently undaunted in spirit because of

(Continued on page 7)

The field was in fine condition and the
weather was perfect, just cold enough
te put a snap into the players. The
large crowd began to gather early and
fully 3,500 people let out a roar when
McManaway kicked-off to Cassell.

The score would indicate that though
the game was close and hard-fought, and
that Furman had the better of the
argument all the way through. However
a close examination of the game will
leave much room for doubt.

In the first quarter the two teams
battled up and down the field without
either side proving dangerous. Furman
did succeed in bringing the ball to David-
son’s 20-yard line, but lost it on a
fumble.

The second quarter was all Furman‘s.
On an exchange of punts, McFadden’s
punt struck Douglas on the 12-yard line.
This gave the ball to Furman on her own
20-yard mark. Starting from this point
the “Hurricane” swept straight up for a
touchdown. It took 22 line bucks, end-
runs, and cut-back plays before Rhames,
when Davidson's line held like a stone
wall, slipped around left end for a touch-
down. Except for Rhame’s 20-yard run
on an off tackle play, no gains of over
eight yards were made. The. Wildcats
fought hard but did not seem to be able
to stop the Purple backs until after they
had gained three or four yards. Speer
kicked goal and the scoring ended. The
Hornets seemed satisfied with their
