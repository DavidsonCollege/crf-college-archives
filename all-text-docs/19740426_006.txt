Delights

In English Comprehensives

The smoke has cleared off
the scene of one major battle,
but the war is not over. It's
comprehensives time again.

Last Saturday was one of
those days that would've
delighted the Marquis de
Sade. English Com-
prehensives, History Com-
prehensives, Law School Ad-
mission Tests and Dental
School Tests were all given
Saturday morning.

There was a general air of
‘we who are about to die
salute you’’ hanging like a
cloud around Chambers. It
contrasted rather sharply
with the bright nostalgia of
Alumni weekend and the
lightly lit alumni.

Next Saturday morning will
be more of the same as
Sociology § Comprehensives
and Graduate Record Exams
are given - On Spring Frolics
weekend, no less.

Comprehensives may be
imevitable - like Death and
taxes - a necessary evil - but I
doubt it. I don’t deny that

some form of testing or some
evidence of knowledge in one's
major field is desirable, but |
don't feel that the student
should emerge from Com-
prehensives with a trip to Dr
Marshall for a picture of the
new hole in his (or her)
stomach.

The academic pressure at
Davidson is usually at a level
under which most of us can
still operate. I have heard
students say that they do their
best work under pressure.
This attitude should not be
taken for granted as the norm,
however.

The theory that the student
body will study and achieve
excellence if the screws are
tightened just a little bit more
won't wash. “A little more
pressure’ leads to ulcers,
destruction of pleasure in the
act of iearning, and suicides.

The extreme of suicide may
seem melo-dramatic and
discounted as journalistic sen-
sationalism. But when you
look out the window in a

inckney Attacks Financier Fallacies,
Cornell Resolves Ambiguous Stance

To the Editer:

The article in the April 12
issue Concerning Mr. Cornell's
speech on the financial
problems resulting from
coeducation includes several
misconceptions and fallacies
which need to be clarified.

First of all, the trustees
have made two decisions: 1)
to make Davidson a
coeducational institution; and

goal of Davidson. Cornell
suggests that while increasing

we only insignificantly in-
crease the faculty, thus
decreasing the faculty-student
ratio to 1:17. This destroys one
of the greatest attractions of
Davidson.

There are only two reasons
for an increase in the size of
the student body : more tuition
money and a tradition of 1000
men. The first has been shown
to be more than offset by in-
creased costs.

As for tradition, I ask the
trustees, is the Davidson
tradition 1000 men. or high
academic quality? Given
coeducation, these two
traditions appear to be
mutually exclusive.

A friend of mine has defined
the trustees as a group of men
reason in faver of some
strange form of intuition...”

munity of 1200 students, I am
afraid I shall have to agree

with him.

To the Editer: — °
I understand that at the
Faculty Meeting on April 16,
1974, a was raised
about the validity of a statistic
quoted in THE DAVID-
SONIAN of April 12, 1974. This
Statistic was in a feature story
written by Bruce Corser, a

stitution. 4
First, I want to emphasize I
did not ask or encourage Mr.

Corser to write this article.

Secondly, no one from the
faculty, staff, or student body
has dropped by to see me or
called me by phone to question
the validity of any of my
remarks. It was unfortunate
that the question was raised in
a faculty meeting where |
could not explain or clarify my
remarks.

In my CMC speech I tried to
point out the pros and cons of
“going co-ed’’ as they might
relate to finance, develop-
ment, curriculum, and ad-
missions. I was asked to cover
these four areas by my CMC
host. I concentrated on finan-
ce and development, since |
have expertise in these areas.

In my CMC remarks |
cautioned that if sufficient
funding were not available
when we at Davidson arrived
at 1500 students, there might
be several casualties. These
could include:

(1) dropping entire
academic ;

programs,

(2) dropping courses which
had low enrollment and were
not vital to the liberal arts
core;

student ratio to — say 1:17;

or a combination of these
four courses of action.

I did not say these would
happen — rather that they
could happen. I don’t feel this
was an irresponsible
statement given the condition
of many private institutions
since ‘‘the financial squeeze”’
began in the late 1960's.

What I specifically em-
phasized was that the CMC
trustees especially had to be
alerted to the possible

which may come
with ‘‘student expansion’’
(whether it be male or
female) and that trustees,
alumni, students, friends,
faculty and staff had to be

keenly aware of the need to
generate more income from
the college's endowment. The
latter can be achieved in two
ways: (1) internal growth of
the endowment especially in
the equities portion; (2) ad-
dition of new money to the en-
dowment.

Often quick quotes are
misleading, and the reader or
listener may be inclined to in-
terpret out of context. If any of
you have any further
questions on my CMC
remarks, drop around or call
me, I'll try to clarify sen-
tences, phrases, or am-
biguities. —_C. David Cornell

Letter To The Editor

college library and see a
student about to jump from a
third floor ledge to a concrete
walk (as I have seen) it's not

makes a certain type of
pressure necessary. I am not
suggesting that students
should be encouraged to
regard their studies flip-
pantly.

At the same time, the
passing or failing of Com-
prehensives or courses should
not be established as a deter-
minant of life or death im-
portance.

And unfortunately, I think
that some members of this
community regard matters in
exactly that light.

Comprehensives are over
for me. The sense of relief is
terrific. 1 must admit that
much of the pressure which I
felt in preparing for and
taking comprehensives was
self-inflicted.

But it is important to re-
emphasize the fact that most
Davidson students value their
education. We are willing to
‘‘go the extra mile’’ if the goal
is worthwhile.

The application of intense
pressure is really not
necessary to achieve the
desited result from most
students. The application of
that pressure may sooner or
later have results that cannot
be partied away the night af-
ter the tests

Stopher Clarifies His

Pre-Law Positions

To the Editor:

It is with regret that I find it
necessary to write in referen-
ce to Mr. John Cook's article
entitled ‘Career Counseling
Criticized’’ (April 19 issue of
THE DAVIDSONIAN), par-
ticularly the section in which
“Bob Stouffer” was quoted.

While I ee become ac-
Customed to having my name
mispelled, I am afraid that I
shall never become ac-
customed to being mi ;

The fact that Mr. Cook was

pe Bo ap nchadgs-sagente
that he missed the sense
what was said is ing.

The fact that he further
presumed to expose his
€rroneous impressions under
the guise of a direct and exact
quotation is indefensible. |
wish to take this opportunity
to set the record straight.

As I told Mr. Cook, I have
had no reason whatsoever to

criticize the Davidson pre-law
program since I was admitted
to the law school that was my
first choice.

remind him that accuracy is

likewise a virtue in writing,
