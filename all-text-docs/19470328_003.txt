Dr. C. Kaye Brown, Dean of the
faculty, announced this week in an
exclusive release to the best col-
lege newspaper on the Hill, that a
wide variety of courses would—be
offered in this year’s summer
school. The two semesters will run,
as usual, from the morning follow-
ing the graduation of the Phi Beta
Kappas in the senior class, to one-
half period before a Freshman
orientation in the fall. Places will
be held for all those seniors who
expect to graduate but won’t quite
make it.

it would be the future policy of the
school and of himself. (Ape Man)
to continue the present plan of
campus beautification by the
spreading of richer, deeper foot-
paths not only on the widely used
Post Office Trail, but to other walk-
Ways as well.

Current plans call for new walks
leading to Fraternity Court, the
Y. M. C. A. guest house, and the
bushes on the third floor of East.
It is Mr.:Means’ idea that bushes
can be used extensively in decorat-
ing the new paths, but he adds that
“there is much to be done.” “If
you give a man enough rope, he’ll
hang himself.” “I'll be hanged if
I'll be hanged.”

A job worthy of the combined ef-
forts of a thousand Texas cattle
has already been put into this proj-

ministrative officials. All seem to
realize his ability to spread beauty,

Dogs Do It

As flames licked toward the sky,
the sons of Wooglin rounded. up
all the dogs in Davison to assist
in quenching the flames. Miss Mur-
gatroyde Flink, charming scion’ of
the Flink family of Winston-Salem,
who is reported to have been burn-
ed in another fire lit by Ennett, ap-
proached several Betas who were
assisting in quenching the flames
and_askéd if they had enough hose
to do it properly.

Williamson, who indicated that
every member of the gang partici-
pating in lighting the fire would
be prosecuted to the full extent of
the law, thanked Miss Flink with
an official smile of approval, and
stated in expressing his apprecia-
tion the kindness shown by
Beta girls in the past, “As soon as
we get a shack up, we
plan to invite all those who have
been so free with their gifts to
participate in the dedieatory sery-
ice.”

James Jackson, president of the
Y. M. C. A., who is famous for the
magnanimity of his deeds in every
line, spent some time inspecting the
punch bowl used by Ennett in ear-
rying part of his incendiary agent
to the scene of the crime, and stated
in an exclusive release to the David-

campus, “Second biggest goldarned
