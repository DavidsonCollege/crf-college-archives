Cutting Strings

Freshmen were treated to a per-
ceptive analysis by Student Body
President Tom Earnhardt of some
of the more misguided interpreta-
tions of student power during their
orientation last week.

Earnhardt attempted to present
to the freshmen some of the danger-
ous tendencies he saw at the con-
vention of the National Student
Association this summer. Some of
the actions taken by NSA seemed
to be born out of a sense of super-
shame caused by the discovery that
the association had been accepting
funds from the Central Intelligence
Agency in return for performing
missions for the CIA in foreign
countries. While the revelation of
this secret deal by ‘‘Ramparts”
magazine last spring might well be
just cause for shame, the reaction
of NSA was extreme.

But a more disturbing factor was
the fact that the convention seemed

to be trying to make the concept -

of student power an imitation of the
extreme “Black Power” advocates.
Regardless of the merits of “Black
Power,” students are not generally
faced with the same problems that
face deprived Negroes.

Much of the student power con-
cept stems from the valid assump-
tion that student activities which
depend on financial support from
the college or university will also
have to deal with control from the
same source. Money or the lack of
money is certainly one of the most
effective control devices in our so-
ciety. Realizing this fact of life,
some student governments, student

newspapers and other such activities.

began trying to establish independ-
ent money sources a few years ago.
This was a wise step that would
achieve its end of reducing school
control.

But now it seems that much of
the student thought is trying to
twist this sound idea around into
something else much less effective.
Breaking the lines of communica:
tion is something quite different
from cutting the apron strings. Yet
adhering to the idea of ‘Don’t trust
anybody over 30" as some student
leaders seem to be trying to do is
simply rejecting whatever help they

Now Use It

Walking through Chambers Build-
ing is the best argument to be found
in support of the administration's
decision to renovate the old build-
ing instead of constructing a new
classroom and administration build-
ing. Greatly improved lighting and
tasteful decoration give the inside
a brightness and newness that shows
off the excellent job done by the
designers of the renovation project.

President D. Grier Martin told
the freshman class last week that
a new building incorporating the
features found in the present build-
ing would cost about $3 million.
The renovation cost less than a third
of that amount by making use of a
very sound building. The old build-
ing is in such shape that it caused
one foreman on the job to note that
it was built like a “cement battle-
s ip.” f

Not to make full use of the build-
ing would be an insult to the men

An Easy Out

Regardless of whether or not Rap
Brown and James Foreman have re-
lieved any of the black people's
misery, they certainly have made
things a lot nicer for right-wingers
and others who specialize in easy
solutions.

Few Negroes are really going to
get anything worthwhile by ex-
changing political and economic
action for demagoguery and vio-
lence. Every step in that direction,
moreover, is to the advantage of
the comfortable whites who want
to find the answers to the problems
of the Negro and the poor in gen-
eral in simple homilies from Ameri-
ca’s Puritan past.

This summer’s lawlessness dem-
onstrated the inability of metropol-
itan police to deal with the prob-
lems of their cities. Ghetto dwellers
had been pointing this failure out
for years. But they were talking
about police brutality, something
that had no meaning for the com-
fortable and respected middle-class.

can receive from members of their
school faculty and administration.

Students have sense enough to
know that they cannot believe or
accept everything handed out to
them by their elders. Such pro-
nouncements from the people who
thus far have failed to come up with
the solutions to the misery of this
much-battered world must always
be taken with the proverbial grain
of salt. But all of the members of
the college or university communi-
ty are basically committed to the
same tasks. For them to act as
enemies is useless.

Carpetbagger?

Davidson students made many
giant steps toward achieving real
student responsibility within the
college community last year. Instead
of sitting back to enjoy its laurels,
however, the student body must
hasten to take advantage of some of
the opportunities facing it.

Some members of the Board of
Trustees have indicated a willing-
ness to accept some informal stu-
dent participation in their meeting
this fall. The Blue Sky Committee
has discussed favorably more in-
formal direct student responsibility
in the actual governing and run-
ning of the college. The contribu-
tions that students can make to
Davidson are becoming more re-
spected all of the time.

Yesterday President Martin noted
that Tom Earnhardt, student body
president, had launched a campaign
to have the carpet in the College
Union lounge replaced. Admittedly,
a new rug is necessary, especially
since the present collection of rat
fur that serves as a carpet presents
such a bad image of the college to
the prospective students who make

the Union a regular stop on their.

initial tours. But is this an issue
which should have to occupy the
energies of the student body presi-
dent? At least the Student Council
could get around to naming a suc-
cessor to the now-graduated Doug
Woodworth who presented student
views to the Blue Sky Committee
last year.

who directed the project. Quiet
Study space has always been at a
premium at Davidson, especially for
groups of students who want to get
together for discussion. Such at-
tempts in the dorms easily turn
into general hall bull sessions that
accomplish nothing.

A deliberate attempt has been
made in Chambers to increase
seminar facilities. If the college
could overcome the paranoia which
causes it to lock up the building at
4:30 p.m. every day, these rooms
could be utilized for evening and
afternoon study. The atmosphere in
the bright new rooms is certainly
much more inviting than the gloomy
confines of the library. If the Stu-
dent Council would sponsor late
hours for Chambers, it could super-
vise room use so that students would
not be troubled by the confusion
found in dormitories. Such super-
vision could also make sure that
the study privilege was not abused.

Now, all of a sudden, the inepti-
tude of much of the nation’s police
force has been made real to the
honkeys in a different way. So they
have started calling for improved
police training and certain changes
in the legal structure. Both of these
are certainly needed.

But those changes are irrelevant
to the issues which led to this sum-
mer’s violence. Commendation of
thrift and hard work, appeals for
improved police protection and con-
sideration and condemnation of Rap
Brown and Stokely Carmichael have
been adopted by the uninformed
and the apathetic as easy solutions
to the racial and economic problems
of this country. It seems that all a
community needs is an underfinan-
ced alphabetical poverty agency run
by the local rich and a strong police
force. This is the sort of hypocrisy
that causes the frustrations which
lead to looting and race riots instead
of honest attempts at meaningful
solutions.

Student GI Reacts To War

EDITOR’S NOTE: Mike
Sigman is a 21 year old
freshman who hes just
completed four years in
the U.S. Marine Corps. He
has just returned from a
tour of duty in Vietnam.

To The Editor:

Earlier this year I retired
from the Marine Corps in
order to acquire my B.S. in
electrical engineering,  al-
‘though I have previously at-.
tained many honors in B:S.
before. With these qualifica-
tions and goals in mind I
began to pack my bag for the
trip to Davidson, which I
have since fallen in love with
— along with Charlotte.

I cannot say that I was in-
stilled with any deep love for
the Corps, but I must admit
to an indebtedness for the
experience that I might not
have gained had I gone im-
mediately into college from
high school. Not many col-

Vietnam. On the other hand.

sides represented in the en-
grossing political drama of
Vietnam — LBJ's, Ho Chi's,
the American Negro, etc. ad
infinitum. With so many
pithy statements floating
about, anyone with any ex.
perience or imagination con-
cerning Vietnam is naturally
supposed to have deep con;
victions about the pro’s and
con’s. In short, you have to
choose sides.

However, it has been my
experience as a Jarhead that
the mind tends to work on
more immediate problems
. . . the heat. the omnipres-
ent dust, the shortage of food
and time to eat it. the end-
less work details, how to
make money on the black
market and so forth. There
is a certain element of dan-
ger to consider. also. At best,
a tour of Vietnam can be
described as a hard job with
conditions and pay below
union standards, and not as
a practical exercise in philo-
sophy.

Now that I am ensconced
in Davidson, I can more com-
fortably ponder the remarks
of Isidore, Physiologus. Pliny,
LBJ and H. Rap Brown...
or even formulate some sort
of opinion about ‘*‘Nam."’

Tt would be too lengthy to
list all the contributing fac-
tors to my reasoning, so I'll
merely give the result of my
mental magic — WAR IS
BAD — which is actually
rather profound. Nay, as-
tounding. I suspected as
much while I was getting
shot at.

What's it like coming from
the’ Marines into college? It’s
a lot like I had expected it,
but there were a few sur-
prises those first days. Da-
vidson is definitely not the
dog-eat-dog world of the Ma-
rine Corps. Our BMOC's are
more subtle than I gave them
credit for, and a lot of them

are good guys, even.

None of the faculty have
been extremely zany, except
for one instance where I was
rudely awakened in assembly
by a gunshot. And me a poor
veteran! I am surprised at
how much attention is given
to providing the freshmen
with good times and guiding
hands.

Agency Urges
Wine Taste-In

To The Editor:

As you may know. the Cali-
fornia Wine Institute has
been conducting wine tastings
on college campuses through-
out the country. These lec-
tures have been received
most enthusiastically by both
students and faculty as an
entertaining and informative
cultural event.

Other literature discusses
the Institute's wine-tasting
program. You will note that
it reports on tastings which
have already been conducted
at such schools as Yale, Har-
vard and Dartmouth.

It occurred to us that you
might be interested in host-
ing one of these events as a
unique campus activity. As
public relations counsel to
the Wine Institute, we will be
happy to coordinate all de-
tails, and to provide a selec-
tion of California wines—a
speaker — and appropriate
literature.

If this program is of inter-
est to you. please contact us.
Also, we would appreciate
receiving a choice of dates
for your event so that we can
be sure to have a speaker
available.

Sincerely,

Council President Hits NSA

For four days.in August
Tom Earnhardt, Davidson
Student Council president.
journeyed to College Park,
Md., as the council’s repre-
sentative to the National
Student Association congress.

Although not a voting dele-
gate to the two-week meeting
of 3000 students from over
300 American colleges, Earn-
hardt said he received sev-
eral distinct impressions
about the controversial stu-
dent organization.

“T don't think this organi
zation is at all representative
of students across the na
tion,” stated Earnhardt. ‘‘Al
though it is the largest and
probably most representative
of the national student or.
ganizations, I find it ridicu-
lous to think that NSA can
make student policy for this
country.

“The country is not
equatly represented in all
areas,” he continued. “A
large percentage of the
students came from the
West Coast, the Northeast,
Michigan and Minnesote
schools. The ivy League
and Southern colleges were
spersely represented.”

Earnhardt said his purpose
in attending the congress was
“to evaluate the usefulness
of possible future member-
ship in NSA to Davidson Col-
lege.” Davidson withdrew
from the organization two
years ago.

“I don't believe Davidson
would benefit much from
joining again,’’ he said. “NSA
publications are already
available to us at a slightly
higher rate than members
pay, and other NSA assist-
ance, such as block-booking
of entertainers, is not need.
ed badly here.

“The contact with other
schools received through the
organization is valuable,"’ he
added, “‘but it can be obtain-
ed in other ways.”

Several ‘‘pressure’ groups
such as Students for Demo-
cratic Society were present
at the meeting pushing pro-
grams for NSA _ support.
Some of the legislation was
“politically oriented’ and re-
flected some views of such
groups. A number of inter-
esting “social action’’ bills
were introduced in the areas
of Black Power and women’s
rights.

He felt that NSA opinion
probably were not ‘looked
on as the judgment of ex-

perts."’ He said that “it. was
verv hard for the good at
NSA to be separated from the
bad because NSA was mis-
represented by the press in
a number of cases.”

“I don't feel it would be
politically disastrous for Da-
vidson to join NSA,”’ he con-
cluded. ‘‘I just feel it is sense-
less to join an organization
that offers us few real bene-

The New Wavidsen

By GEOFF SEAMANS
Associate Editor

This fall, the returning Davidson student not only
experiences the malaise and/or excitement which
normally accompanies the beginning of a new academ-
ic year, but he must also articulate a response to the
sudden renovation of the interior of Chambers.

My personal response is mixed. Coupled with an
appreciation of the fact that the building is now at
least presentable, a feeling of guilt is produced, a
feeling whcih accompanies the spending of money and
which is familiar to those of us who have grown up in
the Calvinist tradition.

Perhaps regrettably, within this mixed response
of guilt and appreciation there seems little feeling of
nostalgia. The cause of this lack is uncertain, but |
strongly suspect that a three-year paucity of nostalgia
inducing events is a contributing factor.

The lack of nostalgia strengthens my appreciation
of the renovation project, but the Calvinist guilt feel-
ing stubbornly resists disintegration. After all, the
purpose of the College for years seems to have been
the production of soldiers for a Christ defined in con-
servative, Presbyterian terms. Such a mission called
not for the introduction of educational frills such as
sound wiring and lighting systems, but rather for a
Spartan environment and the application of ‘‘Christian
stewardship” in the application of funds. Deviation
from this pattern, exemplified in a minor way by the
remodeling project, leads to confusion and chaos in
the minds of those cognizant of the change.

Just as the positive factor in my response to the
renovation is reinforced by the lack of nostalgia, so
too is the negative guilt factor reinforced by the auto-
matic negativeness with which one must respond to
anything perpetrated by college officials. The tenor
of the times makes it in bad taste, even gauche, to say
anything good about the designs of a college adminis-

ation.

On Hearing the General at Commissioning

Walls line borders

Where plowed fields

Make a vision clear

For sights that place red marks
On green shirts of youth,

Selling out to causes ,

In ditches stinking with freedom
To kill and die young

And become a man.
