Construction: will soon begin
on a new consolidated shop and
warehouse building for the Physi-
cal Plant.

The new building will give
some of the various divisions of the
Physical Plant a more centralized
location in which to work.

These shops are currently
spread out across campus in tempo-
rary locations, such as the base-
ment of Johnston Gym, that are not
very accommodating in terms of
space or efficiency.

Due to the fact that “just about
every shop overlaps,” Associate
Director of the Physical Plant Philip

running of the Physical Plant.

He hopes it will also alleviate
the problem of cramped space that
some of the shops now face.

Blueprints for the building
are already drawn and the Physi-
cal Plant is now in the process of
obtaining the permit to begin con-
struction.

Cashion expects that this per-
mit will be granted within the next
couple of weeks and that con-
struction will begin soon after
Christmas.

Once begun, Cashion says
that the building should take eight
to ten weeks to complete.

The building will be located

behind the WDAV radio station ,

cards at the town hall, and

Christmas tree at the library.
