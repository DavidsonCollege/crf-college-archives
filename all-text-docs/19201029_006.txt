R. RICHARDS EXPLAINS
P PLAN OF SALVATION

Gives Differences Between Belief
and Faith.

“Belief,” said Dr. Richards in his ser-
mon last Sunday, “Is acknowledging
that a bridge is sound. Faith is walking
out upon it.” He said that there were
thusands of persons all about us who
would acknowledge that Christ was the
Son of God and that He came to earth
to save us from sin, but He showed that
mere intellectual belief was not suffi-
cient.

The sermon was intended to give a:
short concise idea of the plan of salva-'

tion, especially for the benefit of those
who had just signified their desire to
unite with the Church as a result of Dr.
Weatherford’s evangelistic campaign.
A meeting of the session was called after
church to receive these young men.
Dr. Richards showed that mere in-

portunities.

“If T stood at the parting of the ways
and could choose my life work over
again [ would make the same decision
I made 15 years ago, though maybe not
for the same reasons,” were, the words
with which Mr. J. Wilson Smith prefaced
his talk Jast Sunday night at the “Y”
meeting. Having served as a Y. M. C.
A. secretary for a decade and a half,
first as a local secretary in his home
{town of Norfolk and then as a state
secretary in North Carolina, Mr. Smith
had a message straight from the
;shoulder for every man present.
Explaining that he was not a preach-
‘er and would not preach a sermon, but
; would give a few simple facts and state-
;ments from the point of view of a lay-
man; he went on to give the reason for
his opening sentence.

hot enough to save a soul. He said that convinced that the world needs Chris-
faith must take the deeper form of true. tianity as never before, the warring na-
seeking after Christ. As an outward tions of Europe, this country, the great
sign of their resolution to become Chris-' mission fields, all need Christ today and

tians he urged all who had not done so
to unite themselves with the Church.

' “Then, | am convinced that the world
/needs men, Christian men, and the
| United States has to supply these men.

The manhood of Europe lies under the
sod, the war wiped out the flower of
-their youth. The opportunities for a
:young man to do good for humanity
are unlimited, if we will but look for
_ them.

“In the last place, 1 wouldn’t change
my work for it is the happiest work in
‘the world. Only can you realize this,
when you have the supreme joy that
comes from bringing a wandering soul to

forever.”

Mr. Smith closed by telling the need
of Christian workers on the Mission
fields today. In China alone, there is a
need of 16 Y. M. C. A. workers a year,
‘and last year only five answered the
call. There is a vast amount of work to
be done, but the workers are not forth-
coming fast enough.

EVERYBODY OUT TO HEAR |

DWIGHT SUNDAY NIGHT

Dwight Chalmers, '20, will speak to
the fellows at the “Y" Sunday night. He
'needs no introduction, for he has been
vitally connected with every activity
-on the Hill for the past four years, and
is known to everyone for his enthusiasm
and friendliness. Dwight will have a
live, wide-awake message for every,
man on the Hill, and it is reasonable to
expect every fellow to be out at six-
thirty, Sunday night to show him that
Davidson student body still has the
“pep.”

I po
A DISMAL FUTURE.

“With few exceptions,” says J. Fort
Newton in a letter to the Christian
Register, of Boston, “The Churches in
New England are almost empty, and all
the churches are declining, not only in
‘actual members, but in influences and
power. This began before the war, and
goes on unarrested. The fault lies
largely in the pulpit, and unless there is
a different. preaching, the future is dis-
mal.”

If the fault. lies in the pulpit, as the
article says, it is time that strong young
men, whose vision of Jesus Christ is not
dimmed by popular favor and money,
to step forward with the life-giving and
all-sufficient Gospel of the Man of Gal-
ilee, and lead men and women back to
God.

church stands as to total membership
