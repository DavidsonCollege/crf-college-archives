To the Editor:

This letter is written in reply to last
week’s article by Bill Barnett. As a
coed, I also recognize the need for
more interaction between female stu-
dents. I question, however, whether
an all-women eating house is the best
answer. One problem such.a house
will encounter is financial.

The “founders” have stressed that
girls will be faced with less starchy
foods. But by replacing these inex-
pensive foods with salads— perishable
food that must be bought out of
season—the cost of meals will greatly
increase. How many girls will be
willing to pay more money when
they are actually eating less?

Secondly, I realize that the last
thing Angie Wright and Margaret
Herman want is a sorority. But the
way Patterson Court works socially,
what house will want to combine with
an all-female eating house for a party
except an all-male eating house?

I also feel that an all-female eating
house will separate only further the
coeds as a distinct sex. It’s hard
enough at Davidson to have working
friendships. But when you take away
casual interaction of sexes at meals,
you are increasing a view of girls as
just dates.

My final consideration centers
around what an eating house should
stress. The girls emphasize that their
house will often invite speakers; act

Yuk, Yuk

To the Editor:

“The Davidson cops, ha!”’

“Those country hicks.’’

“The Davidson cops; all they guard
is 7-11.”

Yuk. Yuk. Yuk.

“Those dudes are a real joke.”

‘The metropolitan-Davidson police
regiment.”

‘All they do is drink coffee and look
tough.”

Yuk. Yuk. Yuk.

“What a bunch of rednecks.”’

“The cops? A real joke.”

“Are you kidding, ha. Clowns.”

Yuk. Yuk. Yuk.

“They have an 1.Q. of 130....com-
bined.’’

“Ts that a police station or a utility
closet?”’

‘‘Precinct number two. Are you
kidding me?”’

“Love that crew cut.”

Yuk. Yuk. Yuk.

For years the police of the City of
Davidson have been belittled, lau-
ghed at, ridiculed, and otherwise
demeaned in stature by the student
body, publicly and privately. The
student newspaper and the yearbook
have repeatedly printed candid pho-
tos reflecting little respect.

And we, the student body, are
wrong.

Respect is something a professional
not only earns but expects. THE
MAN has the badge. THE MAN has
the gun. THE MAN has the court
system and the law to back his action
and judgment.

In Davidson, THE MAN can issue
$27 traffic tickets almost at will,
without hesitating to consider a
warning ticket.

Wouldn’t it be better to have the
police working in consideration for the
student body instead of in spite of us?
At $27 a hit, I’m a believer.

on community service projects, spon-
sor forums. But in my opinion what
Patterson Court desperately needs is
a house whose main concern is in
easing the present strain on eating
spaces.

If the girls want service projects
and interaction, why not a lounge on
Jackson Court and scheduled lunches
maybe twice a week where ail girls
could gather?

To the Editor:

Bravo to The Davidsonian for
pointing our a problem that has been
tolerated around here simply too long:
the inadequacy and incompetancy of
the Davidson Police Force.
stealthily hiding in the bushes or
whatever. At least we would know
they were doing their jobs.

I think that the death of Mr.
Sherrill this past summer brought the
extent of the problem into sharper
focus. During the years he we; here,
he was campus security, it seems.
Sure, he was old and slow, and he
didn’t carry a gun, but it was the
jeemingly little things he did, such as
ocking doors, checking on late-study-
ng students, walking around cam-
pus, and providing that friendly,
personal touch. The police relied on
Mr. Sherrill to do this part of their
jobs, and this he willingly did, for
being visible and personable was
something that came naturally to
him. But he confided to me more than
once that he thought they were a
“‘sorry bunch,’’ and it seems that,
prima facie, he may. have been right.

For now Mr. Sherrill (bless his soul)
is gone, and we realize how much the
police haven’t been doing. Capt.
Hughes says ‘‘they’re not out there to
be seen; they’re out there to see,’’ but
this seems to be one, a convenient
cover-up for why no one ever sees
them on campus, and two, a poor way
to prevent crime. Surely they could
cover more territory and reassure
more people by their presence if they
were walking around instead of

As it is, I honestly believe they do
not patrol inside the campus perime-
ter at night. A mass murder could
occur in the front of Chambers and
the police wouldn’t know it. Well,
maybe, they would hear the screams
since they’re usually in the snack bar
eating burgers.

PASTORAL SCENE puts Davidson pressure into perspective.

Heath ignites
libertarian spark

By CHARLES ERWIN
Asst. Features Editor

The Libertarian movement,
which as been floating around
in the back halls of American
philosophy for quite a while,
has suddenly struck Davidson
College.

The Young Libertarian Alli-
ance, an organization of Liber-
tarian students, is presently
struggling to emerge on cam-
pus.

Freshman Eugene Heath,
who is an ardent Libertarian
himself, has been working to
found a local chapter.

One person responded to his
December notice in the An-
nouncement Sheet. Through
discussions with other stu-
dents, he has secured one more
prospective member. He be-
lieves there are a lot more
sympathizers to be reached.

Heath has sent off an affilia-
tion petition to the national
organization. He plans to seek
official SGA recognition on
campus in the near future. The
North Carolina Libertarian
Party will hold a board meet-
ing in the Union next Sunday
afternoon.

Heath plans to put out an
information table outside of
the Post Office sometime next
week. He plans to show a film,
“The Incredible Bread Mach-
ine’, just before exams.

In 1972, the Libertarian
«Party ran its first presidential
candidate, Dr. John Hospers,
who is the chairman of the
USC Department. of Philo-
sophy. Hospers wound up
with one electoral vote, com-
pared with 17 for George
McGovern.

Roger MacBride was the
party presidential candidate in
1976. He received 183,000
votes nationally and 6 percent
of the Alaskan vote. This put
it ahead of any other American
third party.

The party was only founded
in 1971 by a group of activists,
in Denver. ‘‘In five years the
Libertarian Party has over-
come tremendous obstacles to

establish itself as the only
viable third party in Amer-
ica,’’ according: to Heath.
Heath is careful to point out
that the party is neither a
radical left-wing group or a

reactionary right-wing group.

It simply stands for the ad-
vancement of personal liberty
in America.

The group believes that
each individual has the right
to life, liberty, and property;
but that these rights are
presently being violated by
the Federal bureaucracy.

Heath also said that ‘“‘Gov-
ernment should be limited to
providing courts, police pro-
tection, and defense.”

Libertarians believe in the
value of a totally free market,
“regulated by subsidies, pro-
duct regulation, regularity
agencies and wage and price
controls,’’ he said.

“Victimless crime laws
be repealed, government spy-
ing On individual citizens
should be stopped, and the
CIA should be abolished,’’
said Heath.

“Our ultimate goal is the
free society based on indivi-
dual rights and volunteer-
ism,’’ he stated.

‘‘As long as governments
have the coercive powers to
draft and tax; war will inevit-
ably arise. The United States
should aim for isolationism,
which is the only police com-
putable with the rights of
individuals,’’ Heath said.

“T have found that too
many people have a mytholo-
gical idea about the omnis-
cient goodness of govern-
ment,”’ said Heath.

‘Some of my ideas may
seem strange or new. When I
first encountered the ideas
back in high school, some of
them also made me squirm
intellectually. But often I
found out more about the
issues, I came to uphold the
Libertarian ideals.

“Tf any of what I have said
has struck a spark, don’t give
up; the cause of liberty is too
important,” he concluded.
