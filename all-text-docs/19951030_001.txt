* The NCAA men’s soccer fi-
nal four has left Davidson, buthigh-
profile tournaments have not.

The school will hostthe men’s
and women’s soccer conference
tournaments this weekend as well,

“asthe Deep ‘South field hockey ]"
tournament. On November’ 7-19,

Davidson will also host the confer-
ence volleyball tournament.

Game Management Director
Lee Sargent says that Davidson
was awarded the Southern Confer-
ence events based in part on the
school’s past experience with han-
dling big events.

“All those events are obtained
through a bid process,” he says.
“The advantage that we have is
that in certain sports, we have a
good gauge on what our appeal is

involved. They do know that who-
ever lit the fire did so without the
supervision or permission of cam-
pus police, town police, the Union,
or the fire department.

According to an unofficial
source, two male independents who
were at Kappa Sig were suppos-
edly involved in lighting the bon-
fire and then taking off..

Lasting for only an hour be-
tween one and two a.m. (daylight

savings time), the fire drew a large
crowd of students from Kappa Sig
and KA parties. The Union had
planned for the bonfire, which re-
quired a permit by law, and a band
for Friday night, but due to the
rain, it was canceled.

The Physical Plant was going
to clear away the materials left in
the center of Patterson Court Mon-
day morning. According to cam-
pus police officer T. G. Ramsey,

no one thought anyone would light
a bonfire without going through
the mandatory procedures with the
school and town.

When the campus police of-
ficers on duty realized the situa-
tion, they called the fire depart-
ment and the Davidson town po-
lice to help clear out students and
extinguish the flames.

In accordance with proper fire
extinguishing procedure and stu-

dent safety, the police asked stu-
dents crowding around the pit to
move away from the fire. Officer
Ramsey says that before people
cleared away, “we had. students
jumping across the fire; one just
about fell in the fire.”

According to police, one stu-
dent, sophomore John Matthews,
refused to move away from the fire

The women of each Patterson

Big Buddies program, and the
Freshman Class came together to
provide a free Halloween carnival
and haunted house for the Davidson
community last Tuesday.
Included in the festivities at
Johnston Gym were a bean bag
toss, face painting, pin the frog on
the witch, and “Goo-Grasp,” where

guided children through the dark
rooms, where she claimed Mr.
Johnston died. The children
watched as a student pretended to
be a mortician working on his body.
They could also touch Mr.
Johnson’s “eyeballs.” Then the
chilren were chased out by ghosts.

The project was conceived,
planned, and put together in a short
amount of time, yet the organizers
did not face any major problems.

At the same time, upperclass
women wish to get to know them.
To alleviate this problem, the ser-
vice chairs of Warner Hall, Liz and
Jean Boehmler, conceived the idea
of the Halloween carnival.

They approached Kurt
Holmes andasked him if they could
put together a service project in-
volving both their eating house
and the women of the freshmen
class. Holmes approved the idea,
with the stipulation that every eat-
ing house be invited to participate.
