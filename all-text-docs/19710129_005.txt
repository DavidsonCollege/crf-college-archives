Subtle Lure Of Coeducation:

Davidson College
On ‘The Bounding Main’

By GRAY WILSON
Asst. Managing Editor

You've heard of the face
that launched a. thousand
ships, but did you know that
the name. of Davidson Col-
lege has actually launched
two warships?

During World ‘War UI both
the liberty ship William L.
Davidson. and he victory
ship Davidson Victory were
christened and sailed to: sup-
port the Allied effort. The
naming of these ships was
included as a part of the
war mobilization program.,

The S.S. William L. Da-
vidson, named after the
same Revolutionary War
general as this college, set
sail from the port of Wil-
mington, N. C. ine March
1943,

Mrs. Chalmers G. :David-
son, wife of the Director of
the Davidson College Libr-
ary, took part in the launch-
ing ceremonies, smashing a
bottle of champagne against
the hull for good luck.

Like all liberty ships the
S.S. William L. Davidson
was manned by the, Merch-
ant (Marines, with a few

U.S. Navy men aboard. The
Skipper was Captain John
A. Seagren,

The ship made her first
run as a supply vessel to
Russia via the Panama Ca-
nal. Unloading at the Per-
sian Gulf, she returned home
to ‘New Orleans after round-
ing the Cape of Good Hope.

The ship,sailed alone, and
Lieutenant R. ‘_W. Drexmit
reported that there was no
action except: firing on a
whale. The Captain, how-
ever, logged an incident in
which a submarine attacked
and was repelled by firing.

Drexmit commented on the

general state of the crew
during the voyage: ‘‘Despite

the fact that a church col-.
lege bore the same name as ~* its war duties, the victory

I ran across an article in
the library the other day by
Hollins College President
John <A. Logan, entitled
“Women's Colleges: an Ap-
praisal’’ (Hollins College
Bulletin).

I had heard that President
Logan was strongly opposed
to coeducation, and I was
anxious to see how he had
managed to avoid the pres-
sure felt by many of’ his
colleagues in.this regard.

He began with his view as
to why many men's colleges
had gone coed. These schools
had begun experiencing a
drop in ‘‘topflight appli-
cants,"’ attributing this loss
to the lure of coed schools.

So, he reasoned, the all-

the ship there was little
praying aboard except by
the natives in the Persian
Gulf who would get down on
all fours and cry to Allah
on the slightest provoca-
tion.”

The $.S. William L. David-
son was laid up at the end
of the war, and as of 1967

she had not been moved. —

Since that date, she may
have been withdrawn for
scrapping.

The S.S. Davidson Victory
was only one of large group
of high-powered _ victories
named for colleges and uni-
versities.

She ‘was launched from
Portland, Oregon in Febru-
ary 1945. In return for the
name Davidson College col-
lected a library from its
alumni and the community
and donated it to the ship.

After the completion of

ship was attached to the
(Pacific-Atlantic S.S. Com-
pany in 188 and renamed
(Montana. In 1961 she was
returned to the U.S. Depart-
ment of Commerce for lay-
up. She still remains in that
state unless reactivated for
duty since 1967.

male schools used the addi-
tion of female students as
bait to lure their prized pro-
digies back to the fold. ‘It
is an inescapable conclusion
that the women are there
for the convenience of the

men, and as an inducement -

to attract them.”

It’s hard to logically argue
with the slippery generaliza-
tions above except to. recog-
nize them as such, and ask
to be shown these ‘‘many
men's colleges."’

And if these colleges are
many, it seems unfair to at-
tribute to the convenience of
their male students the sole
motivation for ¢cdeducation.

Turning to the question of

a women's college going

coed, he cited finances as the
first obstacle. ‘‘Capital out-
lays required to provide
athietic facilities’ and
“larger scholarships . ...
needed -to attract first-rate
men’’ were among the four
additional expenditures lisf-
ed in the articles as accom-
panying coeducation.

As to the former, contrary

to popular belief at D. C., it -

is possible for a small col-
lege to survive without an
elaborate program of athle-
tics. As to the latter, Da-
vidson has attracted ‘‘first-
rate men” (a_ subjective
judgment on my part, I
know) for many years with
a financial-aid-tofinancial-
need policy.

Logan answered the claim
that it is more natural to
study in a coed setting by
conveniently declaring: ‘‘We
should remember anyway

LETTER

that higher education is pret-
ty ‘unnatural’ at best. What
could be more unnatural
than keeping healthy young
adults couped up in dusty:
libraries when they are at
the peak of their physical
prime?"’

This line of reasoning is
insulting to me for three
reasons: 1) [It is an evasion
of the issue;2) It is painful
to think that any college pre-
sident would. equate..the ex-
perience of higher education
with” “being couped up in
dusty libraries;"' 3) If high-

“er education is unnatural,

then the epitome of unnatu-
ralness is separating the
sexes, constricting the ex-
pression of one’s physical
prime ‘to weekend mara-
thons.

The clincher for me was:
‘Like it or not, the prevail-
ing ethic in this country ac-
cepts the dominance of the
male, and it is the rare ‘wo-
man who will risk regylar
demonstration of her sup
eriority in the classroom.”

If I were a woman, and
the president of my college
said that about my sex, I'd
be insulted: Hopefully the
age of women smiling sweet,
emptyheaded smiles is draw-
ing to a close.

Perhaps the Hollins alum-
ni can buy Logan's argu-
ments — hoping to keep
their. alma mater from tak-
ing another step toward
reality — but I can't.

It makes me wonder if the
exchange program is not a
token appeasement to those
who. want coeducation. I
hope. not.
