Alumni Begin Rusk Endowment Fund Raising

at

Atlanta Group
Donates
$500, 000

By WAYNE MAGRUDER
and DAVID RESNIK

A special dinner honoring former
Secretary of State Dean Rusk °31 kicked
off the fundraising efforts for the Dean
Rusk Endowment for International
Studies on Wednesday in Atlanta’s Col-
ony Square Hotel.

Davidson alumni from Atlanta have
already given $500,000 toward this $10
million project. The Atlanta group’s fun-
draising goal is $1 million.

The fundraising campaign will soon
spread to other cities. Atlanta was chosen
as the starting point because it is where
Rusk grew up. .

International Awareness

The Trustees unanimously approved
the Rusk Endowment during their May
18, 1983 meeting in an effort to bring in-
ternational awareness into the Davidson
community. The program is scheduled to
go into effect in the 1984-85 school year.

Rusk commented on the endowment:

“I feel deeply complimented that they
[the Trustees] wish to associate such a
program with me, and I’m looking at the
program with avid interest.

“The next half century will have a di-
rect and pervasive effect on everyone's
daily life. We must help students get
ready . . . facing problems in achieving
a durable peace, threats to the environ-
ment, energy shortages, and the conse-
quences of a population explosion,” he
said.

The International Education Com-
mittee (IEC), chaired by economics pro-
fessor Clark Ross, has compiled a list of

suggestions for the funds’ use.

Last Tuesday the Educational Policy
Committee approved the IEC’s prelimi-
nary draft for the endowment. The Facul-
ty will consider the draft at their
November 8 meeting.

IEC’s Preliminary Draft

The draft would provide funds for
changes and programs including two or
three new faculty members in the areas of
Sociology; Economic Geography; An-
thropology with a South Asian Focus:
Political Science with a South Asian
Focus; Latin American Studies; Afri¢an

LSAT Answer Sheets Lost In Mail _

By JEFFREY MANN

The answer sheets of the October |
Law School Admissions Test (LSAT)
were apparently lost in the mail. “They
never made it to our office,” said Direc-
tor of Public Affairs Martha McGrane of
the Law School Admissions Services
(LSAS) which administers the test.

McGrane said all the students who
took the test can retake the test on De-
cember 3. All students who took the test
are automatically registered for the De-
cember 3 test.

Professor of Education William
Hight, who supervised the test, mailed

the test sheets the day after the test was
administered. “They never made it to our
office [in Newtown, Pennsylvania],”
McGrane said. “We are confident that
the test administrator [Professor Hight]
got the answer sheets to the Post Office.
There’s no question that everything at
that end was done correctly.”

Senior Joe Jaworski, who took the
October 3 test, said, “At first I was a little
upset, but now I want to use the situation
to my advantage.”

“I'm not too pleased,” senior Mandy
Barber said.

LSAS has contacted other testing ser-
vices to see if the sheets were mistakenly

sent to another organization. They also
sent a representative to Davidson to as-
sure that all procedures were correctly
followed. The Postal Service conducted
traces on October 19 and 25 to try to find
the package.

McGrane said, “If need be we will
contact law schools to intercede on the
candidate’s behalf. The law schools will
be informed that the problem was
through no fault of the candidate’s.”

Letters were sent out yesterday to ev-
eryone who took the test. McGrane said
if anyone cannot take the test again on
December 3, “there is absolutely nothing
they can do.”

Police Arrest Man On Firearms Charges

By DAVID RESNIK

Davidson campus police arrested a
man Wednesday night on charges of
being armed on College property and
carrying a concealed weapon.

Kenneth Dail Richard, 30, of Char-
lotte, was arrested in front of the Guest
House Wednesday at 10 p.m.

Arresting officer Sergeant Henry
Cook received a call from junior Edward
Tavel, who told the police he saw a sus-
picious white male dressed in a hunting
cap, army fatigue jacket, and blue jeans
on the second floor of Chambers asking
questions about a_ student named
“David.”

Cook apprehended Richard one mi-
nute after receiving Tavel’s call. Richard
said he was looking for a student named
“Chuck.” After spotting a bulge in
Richard’s pocket, Cook frisked him and
confiscated a nickel-plated .38 caliber
Smith and Wesson handgun.

Richard claimed that the student he
was looking for had been fooling around
with his wife. He also said he intended to
warn the student.

Cook said Richard had been drinking
and was taking a Valium prescription.

The police are still looking for the
1975 dark blue Ford LTD that Richard
arrived in. Cook said that the car left be-
fore “we could get to it.”

Cook said Richard was looking for
someone who lived in Room 207, but he
did not know which dormitory. Richard
must not have knewn much about the
campus, according to Cook, because he

was looking for dorm rooms in the mid-

dle of the Chambers building.

Cook, said the police have not yet
contacted\the student Richard was seek-
ing. ;

He urged all students to be on the
lookout for strangers and to call the
Police at 892-5131 if they see a suspi-
cious person.

Yesterday the College presented
Tavel with a Certificate of Appreciation
for his help in the arrest.
