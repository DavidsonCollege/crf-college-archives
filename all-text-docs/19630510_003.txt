A NEW COACH

I was able to corner Coach Harry Fogleman a few
days ago in between matches of perhaps the busiest sport
at Davidson. Coach Fogieman is one of the newest addi-
tions to the coaching. staff: He formerly coached tennis at
the University of Cincinnati and is presently a member
of two committees of the United States Lawn Tennis
Association—the Junior Development Committee and the
Research and Planning Committee.

Tennis is another of the sports at Davidson which is
not subsidized. Yet our tennis team has undertaken a
schedule that includes such big-time teams as Michigan
State University, University of Indiana, and the Univer-
sity of North Carolina. Coach Fogieman brings a really
different approach to tennis. which he refers to as one
of. the “other sports rather than minor sports.”

He believes that tennis at Davidson can be an im-
portant part of the athletic program.

When he took over the reins at Davidson, the tennis

‘ program had sunk to such a point that few people cared

to-know who the tennis team was playing. Since Fogleman

has taken over. there has been a change. Here I think ate
some Of the reasons for this change.

Fogleman has a great number of contacts with manv
of the finest young tennis players in the country through
his membership in various tennis committees; When he
arrived at Davidson, he began writing these bovs probing
to see if they were interested. in coming to Davidson.
Some of these boys are at Davidson now. forming the
basis of this year’s freshman team. Why did they come?
“J believe you can promote anything if vou believe in it
and can back it up.” This is Fogleman's philosophy for
building tennis and attracting young tennis players.

There is no doubt that he believes in tennis. Since
coming to Davidson he has supervised. the repair of all of
the courts. Much of this repair work has heen done
through his own labor. He has also put forth a great deal
of effort in an attempt to interest outstanding young
tennis players in coming to Davidson. And he has built up
a schedule that is geographically representative as well
as containing some of the better tennis teams in the coun-
try..He believes in tennis.

He also believes that Davidson. can back up a good
tennis program. Although he lost.one of his prize recruits
because he could not offer him an athletic scholarship, he
emphasized that a good tennis program does not neces-
sarily mean tennis scholarships. He asserts that the edu-
cational advantages that Davidson offers and our tennis
facilities, which he describes as ‘‘the finest in the Soyth,”
present a great deal of material with which to work in
recruiting tennis players. _

_ Coach Fogleman has already learned a great deal
about recruiting without scholarships. He continues to
write letters to young players with whom he comes in
contact. But he has discovered that one of the most im-
portant factors in recruiting a bov is to get him on the
college campus. As a result of this knowledge, he has
contacted many of the prep’schools and high schools in
this area and invited them to play our freshman team.
To date he has already landed two boys for next year’s
freshman team as a direct result of these matches.

One more way in which prospective students get an
opportunity to see Davidson is through the Southern
Juniors and Boys Tournament, which is held at Davidson
every year. This is the largest tournament for young ten-
nis players in the South, and any tennis player who seeks
to be nationally ranked must play in this tournament.
Coach Fogleman has an opportunity during this tourna-
ment to show a great number of boys what he has to
offer at Davidson.

The final factor which Mr. Fogleman did not mention
that he offers to incoming tennis players is Coach Fogle-
man. There is no doubt that the national! reputation which
he has built in the area of tennis is a real factor in the
decision of any outstanding tennis player to attend Dav-
idson.

Coach Harry Fogleman has changed Davidson's ten-
nis picture. He is recruiting some of the more outstanding
tennis players in the country (he already has four boys
who have payed their fees for next year). He is continual-
ly building his schedule so that it will include better and
more diversified opponents. And he has helped to put
the name of Davidson College before the eyes of a great
many tennis fans in the South. He has accomplished these
changes not with pleas for athletic scholarships (although
I imagine he would take a couple) but through the use of
the material ‘things which he has to draw from — the
school, the facilities, his own ability, and some hard work.

Tennis is a minor sport at Davidson. But Fogleman
said, ‘I believe you can promote anything if you believe
in it and can back it up.” And from all indications these
are not merely idle words. Only time will tell just how
well Coach Fogleman can promote tennis at Davidson. |
think Coach Fogleman deserves this time and I think in
the very near future, tennis will occupy a very exciting
part of Davidson’s athletics—especially the spring part.

Seniors Vie With
Faculty Wednesday

BY DENNY PHILLIPS
Davidsonian Sports Writer

On Wednesday, May 15,

the Class of '63 will receive

a final send-off from the faculty in the form of the annual

Senior-Faculty Field Day.

The Field Day will begin at
1:30 when the golf foursomes
tec off at the Mooresville Coun-
try Club. Meanwhile the hardier
spirits of the faculty will at-
tempt a rousing game of tennis,
with the first matehes beginning
at.2 o'clock.

A.volieyball game was origin-
ally scheduled but Coach Whit-
tle vetoed the idea, feeling that
it would be too much for the
faculty, as the big event; the
exciting and fearsome softball
game begins promptly at 4 p.m.
on the baseball diamond. |

Although senior class presi-:
dent John Killian felt the sen-
iors and faculty were fairly
evenly matched. Coach Whittle
was confident that the faculty
could win the golf matches and

| softball game.

Despite brilliant pitching, Davidson s baseball team

last week. The ‘Cats dropped two to Richmond 2-1 and
2-0. but won two from George Washington 7-5 and 13-5.

In the first game at Richmond.

the third inning on a single, a
stolen base. a sacrifice and a

in the seventh on Don David-
gon's triple and an error. Rich-
mond picked un the winning run
in the bottom of the seventh on
a perfectly executed squeeze
play.

In Conference Tennis Play

The Davidson College tennis team captured fifth
place in the Southern Conference tournament held in

Washington, D. C., this past

Monday, Tuesday, and Wed-

nesdav: last year the ‘Cat netters finished in seventh
place. George Washington won the three-day affair by

one point aver the Citadel.

One of the best matches of the
tourney was between Davidson
Captain Bobby Austell and
Stuart Levi of the Citadel in
the semi-finals. Levi took Aus-
tell in straight sets. 10-8 and 6-4;

Turner took the mile and the

880 and formed one-fourth of
the Deacons’ winning mile relay
team. Meanwhile, the Wildcats’
entry from the Turner family
had another fine afternoon.
Alan Turner (no relation) took
the 100-yd. dash with a time of
10.2 seconds and swept to a
time of 22.5 seconds in the 220,
also good for first place. In
| these two events. Tom Watson
and Ken Kelley took second
place and third place respec.
tively.

In the mile. Denny Phillips
and Tom Heffner finished sec-
ond and third behind the Dea-
cons’ Dave Turner. Also con-
tributing to the Davidson cause
were Kelley’s second place in

the difficulties in competing
with a subsidized track team. He
noted too that Don Davidson was
on a baseball trip and Bob Cor-
dle had to stay here with a pull-
ed muscle. Ironically, Cordte's
jump a week before, although
he was suffering from the same
injury at the time, would have
easily taken the broad jump.
Whittle went on to say. “With
these two men out. we possibly

‘Yonight Whittle is with his
