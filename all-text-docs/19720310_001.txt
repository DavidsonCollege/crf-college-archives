WELL HELLO THERE
H. Edmunds White supports increase in coed enrollment.

Female Applications Rise;
Nicholls Wants Coed Dorm

By PHIL BISHOP
Staff Writer

At least 35 women exchange
students will attend Davidson
next year, more than three
times the number of coeds now
on campus.

About 25 of the girls will
come from the four Virginia
women’s colleges in the Eight
College Exchange Program. The
other women will be temporary
students who have applied to
Davidson on their own initiative,
and who may become the col-
lege’s first genuine coeds.

College officials attribute the
sharp rise in applicants to the
Consortium to informal ‘‘recruit-
ing” by former participants ‘in
the program. Only about a doz-
en women have come to David-
son im each of the first two
years of the Consortium, but
applications have more than
doubled for 1972-73.

At least 10 more woman ap-
plicants have been accepted un-
der a policy to allow Queens
women to participate in the Con-
sortium by becoming Davidson
students. The policy was ex-
tended to accept any qualified
female applicant as an exchange
student.

Affairs John M. Bevan said, ‘‘We
will be happy to take as many
exchange students as we can
from other institutions.” He also
said these coeds would be wel-
come to remain to graduate
should the trustees vote this
spring to implement coeduca-
tion.

The question of housing for the
large number of coeds must be
considered by the administra-
tion. Director of Housing Scot-
ty Nicholls said the Consortium
Committee had recommended
the girls be housed in the top
two floors of Little Dormitory
The same recommendation was
rejected last year in favor of
renovating Grey House.

Senate Challenges Rise
In Transcript Charges

By BOB HOWELL

Asst. Managing Editor

Action in the SGA Senate this
week centered on approval and
support of a proposal which
challenges the college’s raising
the fee for pr:paring grade
transcripts from one to two dol-
lars.

Senior Kurt Geisinger present-
ed a report to the Senate in
which he recounted his dealings
with the Registratr’s Office and
his subsequent investigation of
transcript costs.

The present fee covers the
processing of one transcript
plus one update (most trans-
cripts require two) of a_ stu-
dent’s record.

Geisinger’s study revealed that
a transcript or an update could
be produced for about 50 cents

Nicholls felt the administra-
tion would approve a women’s
dorm. ‘‘Last year people recoil-
ed at the idea of a coed dorm,
but now the atmosphere is much
different.” The committee chose
Little because they felt Duke
should remain available to sen-
ior men students.

There are still conflicting opin-
ions in the administration as to
the future of the Consortium if
Davidson should indeed go co-
ed. Those who see the program
as a substitute for coeducation
wish to abolish Davidson’s par-
ticipation, while others who see
it as a chance to live in a dif-
ferent environment want David-
son to remain in the program.

EPC Survey Shows

By DOUG BROWN
Managing Editor

A survey by the Educational
Policy Committee's Subcommit-
tee on Coeducation of eight for-
merly all-male colleges and un-
iversities similar to Davidson
College which have recently be-
come coeducational has reveal-
ed that coeducation has caused
no serious problems and is wide-
ly considered ‘‘a good move".

The institutions investigated.
considered ‘‘at least roughly
comparable to Davidson in size
and educational program,"’ were
Colgate. University, Dartmouth
College, Franklin and Marshall
College, Hamilton College, Ken-
yon College, Princeton Univer-
sity, the University of the South
(Sewanee) and Williams Col-
lege.

‘‘We were pleased and rather
surprised to find that the admin-
istrative officials we contacted

were willing to devote consid-
erable time to answering our in-
quiries,"" said the subcommit-
tee chairman, Associate Pro-
fessor of History W. Brown Pat-
terson.

“We also received from them
a number of studies and reports
which had been prepared on
their campuses when the ques-
tion of becoming coeducational
was being discussed.

“The questions we asked,”
he continued, ‘‘were intended
to elicit information on a num-
ber of important areas: enroll-
ment, admissions, costs, curri-
culm and planning.”

All but one of the institutions
showed ‘‘substantial increases
in total enrollment"’ by adding
women students while keeping
male enrollment the same. Pro-
jected enrollments for the near
future vary from 1,000 to 4,000
and men-to-women ratios are
projected at from 1.3:1 to 4:1.

apiece.

The discrepancy in the two
figures is based chiefly on op-
posing estimates of labor costs.
Comptroller Robert W. David-
son estimated that it took a sec-
retary 20 minutes to process a
transcript, which would allow
one dollar compensation per
transcript to a secretary who
makes three dollars an hour.

However, Geisinger cited sev-
eral cases of students request-
ing transcripts who found that
the information could be proc-
essed. in less than two minutes.

His analysis of cost alllows
four minutes per transcript,
which, at three dollars an hour,
would come to 20 cents.

Geisinger was led to make his
investigation when he realized
that for the average student,
who may need 15 or 20 trans-
cripts in applying to graduate
schools or for jobs, doubling the
fee would prove to be a sizable
increase.

“IT had called Queens, CPCC,
UNC-C and Johnson C. Smith,
and found that at all these
schools the cost of transcripts
was one dollar apiece,” Geising-
er said.

“I decided to inquire from
Mr. Cornell about the rationale
behind the increase, and he at-
tributed it to rising labor and
material costs.”

From there, Geisinger made
his investigation and then _ his
report to the Senate. He told the
Senate that he had recommend-
ed to the Financial Office that,
to lower the cost of transcripts
for the average student, the fee
for any transcript or update be
set at 50 cents each.

“They would not, I believe,
lose money doing this,” Geising-
er said. ‘‘My own cost analysis

Patterson said “For most of
the schools the opinion § was
that the number (of applica-
tions) might be up © slightly,
but that there was no appre-
ciable difference in the quality
other than continued improve-
ment of an existing trend. Most
felt that the initial women ap-
plicants had better test scores.
but that this difference tended
to decrease in subsequent clas-
ses. There was no significant
difference in performance once
admitted."’

In general, the schools expect-
ed expanding enro}iment to in-
crease current revenues about
as much as current expendi-
tures. Several institutions re-
ported that their plans to

add to their plant and en-

dowment had not been ‘“‘signi-
ficantly affected'’ by the move
to coeducation.

“In none of the eight colle-
ges,” commented Patterson"

bears this out.”

He also pointed out the fact
that students in the Honors Col-
lege are not presently required
to pay for transcripts, and said
he had recommended that they
be asked to do so.

Geisinger’s third recommei-
dation to the Financial Office
was that a new application for
transcript and transmittal let-
ter be written.

“The present form does not
inform one just what is being
included’ on a transcript,” he
said.

The Senate also listened to am
appeal made by former SGA
President Danny Clodfelter, who
intends to compile a dossier of
cases of students who have
come before the Curriclum Re-
quirement Committee request-
ing exemption from certain re-
quirements.

“I believe that there are peo-
ple who have for certain rea-
sons needed exemptions and
the committee has gone wrong,”
Clodfelter said, and pointed out,
“There are no students on the
committee to decide what is a
legitimate exemption.”

He asked the Senate to supply
the manpower necesssary to
gather cases and to assemble
the dossier which would docu-
ment those specific instances.
The request will be handled by
the Senate’s committee on Ed-
ucational Affairs.

The Senate also passed a res-
olution, presented by Junior Sen-
ator Steve Suflas, which would
provide for the establishment
a Grievance Committee. The
resolution stated that this direct
link between the students, fac-
ulty and administration would
be to settle disagreements and
misunderstandings that arose
among these constituencies.

Coeduecation Works

“was the curriculum reshaped
for the admission of women.”
In general these schools felt
that the kind of liberal arts
curriculum which they were pro-
viding for men was also appro-
priate for women. The largest
number of curricular changes
were in physical education cour-
ses.

No single answer emerged
in response to the question of
whether the admission of wo-
men had any significant effect
on the intellectual and cultural
life of the college.

Four said the effect was posi-
tive; the others either did not
answer the question or reported
no discernable change. ,

At most of the institutions
planning took place over sev-
eral years and involved stu-
dents, faculty, staff and trus-
tees in the decision-making pro-
cess. Efforts were made to sur-
