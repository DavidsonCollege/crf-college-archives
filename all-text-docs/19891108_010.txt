Women’s soccer ends
after a good first year

Leading scorer Lindsey Forsythe already chosen

to lead next year team

By SPIDER WORMUTH

The women’s varsity soccer pro-
gram ended its season on a somewhat
disappointing note on Saturday. For
their final game, the Lady Wildcats
faced a talented squad from Virginia
Tech, and they started out very slug-
gishly.

In the first nine minutes, Tech
scored three goals on the tentative
Wildcats. The first half continued in
much the same dismal fashion with
Virginia Tech scoring three more times,
and, when halftime mercifully arrived,
the ‘Cats were down 6-0.

After the half, and apparently quite
a halftime speech by Coach Boettcher,
Davidson came roaring back. Though
faced witha seemingly insurmountable
deficit, not unlike the federal govern-
ment’s, the home team continuously

pressured the Tech goal and finally
scored on some marvelous dribbling
and finishing by Lindsey Forsythe.

‘ Davidson continued to dominate and

would score once more. Lindsey again
beat her defender and fired a shot on
goal. The shot was deflected by the Tech
goalkeeper, but Maria Tucker putaway
her eighth goal of the season. Despite
their control of the second half, the Lady
Wildcats were unable toscore moreand
they dropped the game, 6-2.

The women’s team is now looking
forward to their second season, and
Coach Boettcher is already preparing
off-season workout schedules in order
to make the Davidson team a dominant
one next year. In the team’s final meet-
ing of the season, Lindsey Forsythe, last
year’s leading point scorer, was elected
to be the 1990 captain.
