the field and at the plate,” la-
mented Stevens.

tevens pointed to the incon-
sistency of the hitting as one of
the primary mysteries. The
team batting average is a re-
spectable 270, but the batters
have left too many men on
base. according to Stevens.

Latimer throws to Lynn Wagner for a put-out.

“We are just not hitting with
men in scoring position. Our
bats have been silenced by some
pretty sorry pitching.”

The past four losses reflected
the problems which Stevens has
had to face all season.

In a road contest at Pfeiffer,
the Cats were shut out for the
fourth time by a 7-0 score.
Three of the Falcons’ runs were
unearned, coming on a misplay-
ed fly ball with the bases load-
ed.

Last Saturday the Cats drop-
ped a doubleheader to East Car-
ol.na by scores of 4-1 and 4-3.

An unfortunate thing happen
ed to the Cats even before the
twin bill began. Shortstop Jack
Willits lost a contact lens dur
log a warmup drill, and did not
piay in either game.

Willits was replaced by Bick
Halligan, who helped the de-
fense. Stevens also credited Hal-
ligan with playing “a great
game at third base on defense”
at Pfeiffer.

Last season's ace hurler Rick
Pipan started for the first time
in the second ECU game and
pitched four innings.

One bright spot for the Cats
Was the stickwork of leftfielder
George Weicker, who slapped
two hits in each ECU game and
also against Pfeiffer.

Weicker’s 394 average places
him among the conference lead-
ers,

All the Cat weaknesses seem
ed to surface in Tuesday's game
with Duke, which saw the Cats
get clobbered 18-4.

Relief ace Mike Frye started
for the Cats, but he grooved his
fastball several times and did
not survive the first inning.

He was replaced by Greg
Cameron, who could not stop
the onslaught. Joe Duncan was
called on to mop up m the sec.
ond inning, but by that time the
Blue Devils had 13 runs and
were on their way.

Centerfielder Bill Barnhill
took the mound in the ninth in
ning and was touched for the
final Duke run. Barnhill is not
a stranger to that position, how.
ever.

“I pitched some in high school
and I've been pitching batting
practice lately. Against Duke I
didn’t have many warm-ups and
it took me a while to get loose.
My best pitch is the curve, but
I had trouble getting it over,”
he explained.

Barnhill, who has been hitting
only .213 after last season's
.347, sighted lack of concentra-
tion as the source of the team's

problems.
“This has led to a lack of
confidence, and there was a

stage when we were always sec-
ond-guessing ourselves. We got
in a psychological rut of losing.

“Our morale is good though,
and we should be playing for
fun now. I think we'll be looser,
since there’s no pressure,” he
added.

The Wildcats carried a 7-14
worksheet into last night's game
against UNC at Chapel Hill,
who sported a 19-6 ledger.

The Cats can still have the
best record of any Davidson
team. The best mark is held by
the 1958 squad, which went 11-6.
The Cats have not finished over
000 since 1964.

Tomorrow the Cats entertain
conference-leading Furman ina
twin bill at 1:30 p.m. Belmont
Abbey visits Wednesday at 3
p.m., and the Cats host Cataw-
ba on Thursday.

is more foolish
than an
ignorant one.
