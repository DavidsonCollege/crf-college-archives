MONDAY, MAY I, 1995

Looking back as we move forward

As students finish term
papers, study for exams,
and prepare to say
goodbye, The Davidsonian
looks back at 1994-95,

By RANnpy HARTWELL

As always, the 1994-95 school
year at Davidson saw its ups and
downs and ins and outs.

Revived after two years, the
Chambers bell rang through our
stressed days and our relaxed ones,
good moods and bad.

We lost two beloved campus
figures. In June, College Archivist
Chalmers Davidson died at age 87,
and in December, former Secre-
tary of State Dean Rusk died at age
85. Both men were invaluable to
the school, and we are reminded
daily of their gifts by CHAL, the
Dean Rusk Program for Interna-
tional Studies, and Rusk eating
house.

Atthe end of the year, Ambas-
sador Jack Perry will step down as
head of Dean Rusk, Ken Wood
will end his-term as director of
‘Experiential Programs,‘ ‘and’ Bob
Sutton willretire as Vice President
of Business and Finance. Carlton
Pritchard will no longer be in
charge of Auxiliary Services; Ri-
chard Terry of RLO will take over.

In January, Eric Rosenbach
and Allison Sabel were replaced
by Bill Gullan and Warren Buford
as SGA President and Vice Presi-
dent. Morgan Perry was elected to

be Nat May’s sucessor as presi-
dent of the Union Board,

More new leaves were turned
over. Back in August, the class of
1998 arrived, and Tom Shandley
became the new Dean of Students.
Twenty-one new professors are
teaching our classes, and Pollux
became the new VAX system, re-
placing Apollo.

We took time to reflect. The
Honor Code came under review;
students and faculty wondered how
effective it actually is. We asked
ourselves (yet again) how much
we really liked the Court. Debate
over the alcohol policy still goes
on, with all its many facets. The
PCC debated whether to charge
independents, and the CCRL de-
cided partygoers would be wear-
ing color-coded wristbands next
year. While Hillary pushed her
health-care plan, we speculated as
to how good ours at the Student
Health Ceriter is.

We questioned our faith. The
faculty decided to propose to the
trustees that religion professors
shouldn’t have to be Christians,
and the board itself considered
whether the president of the col-
lege should be Presbyterian. In
April, students erected four crosses
both to “increase campus aware-
ness of Easter” and to react “to the

idea that Christianity is unques-
tionable here.”

T-shirts called us “The Eighth
Wonder of the World,” a modest
declaration after the weekly maga-
zine U.S. News and World Report
ranked us the eighth best liberal
arts college in the nation. They
also designated us the fifth best
value in college education and
twelfth most generous with finan-
cial aid. : :

Perhaps due in part to the new
ranking, the number of applica-
tions for admission was higher than
ever. No longer existed the guar-

antee that 100% of student finan-
cial need would be met, because of
rising tuition costs and because
financial aid can only take up 13%
of the college budget.

So, we passed the collection
plate, coming up with some pretty
big donors. John Belk, with his
seemingly bottomless pockets,
gave $1.6 million toward merit
scholarships. John Crosland put
us over the top for the $150 million
Campaign for Davidson, donating
$1 million. Even the Feds were

So,

The question has loomed over
the heads of seniors for nearly a
year. It comes from all directions,
haunting the minds and emotions
of the class of 1995. Parents ask.
Professors ask. Friends ask. Ac-
quaintances ask.

“What are your plans after you
graduate?”

As graduation fast approaches,
some seniors try frantically to find
an answer to that fateful question.

Three weeks ago, junior Pete
Boylan attempted to conducta sur-
vey of seniors to find the correla-
tion between salaries offered and
GPA.

Boylan had to abandon the
project, which was for his statistics
independent project, because, as
he says, “I needed 51 responses,
and L only found 41 people in the
senior class who have jobs.”

; Boylan says “‘the situation has

probably gotten better ... the sur-
vey was right before most people
got responses.” He found that eco-
nomics majors had more luck than

other majors. “They had the top
five salaries and half of the top 20
salaries.”

Senior Karen Peck is confi-
dent about landing a job, although
she has yet to find one. “I’m not
worried because I feel like I’ve

gotten a good education here, and
it’s not the end of the world st I
don’t have a job on May 21 ..
confidentI’ll find something I oa
to do.”

Many seniors plan to further
their education next year or some

time in the future. Senior Sandra
Guzman, who plans to attend law
school in the fall, says, “My focus
and interests have always been in
law.”

“At this point in my life, I
can’timagine doing anything else.”

Seniors reflect on
how Davidson has
changed over the

last four years

By JAy JENNINGS
Staff writer

Seniors have experienced a
great deal of change inthe lastfour —
years. They have witnessed the
completion of the Visual Arts Cen-
ter, the last senior apartment build-
ing, and after much debate, the
outdoor basketball court.

More important to seniors,
however, have been the unseen
changes at Davidson: how the
student body has changed; the
change in atmosphere and attitudes
on campus; and the consequences

of the college’s blossoming na-

tional reputation.

Ashlyn Dannelly admires the
growing toleration for alternate
lifestyles and beliefs at Davidson.
“If you think about how FLAG
met a lot of resistance our fresh-
men year and if you see the
groundswell of support the organi-

zation has now, I think Davidson is
more accepting of differcnt types

of people, and that’s a positive
change. Even if you see negative
letters like those in the Davidson
Journal, that is the Davidson of the
past,” she says

J.D. Semones says, “The main
thing that I notice that is different
is that there are more opportunities
to be involved in studies of differ-
ent cultures. Students can study at
more countries abroad and study
more cultures in classes.”

Ashley Atkins thinks that
Davidson is “more politically cor-
rect, but it has a long way to go.”

Some think that Davidson has
gone overboard. “The school has
tried to mirror the pop culture of
the United States in that what
Washington, D.C. deems as politi-
cally correct,” says Jason Branch.
Davidson tries so hard to emu-
late,” he says. “In an effort to cre-
ate a problem-free, family life uto-
pia, Davidson has limited
everyone’s sense of individuality.
But perhaps even more important
in trying to compete nationally and
make Davidson students the smart-
est in the world, they have lost
sight of what it takes to make a
true, successful, well-rounded
Davidson man.”

Steve Krause sees positive
changes in the new buildings con-
structed on campus and in the im-
proved national reputation of
Davidson. But the school has
stripped autonomy away from the
Court. He says, “The school re-
stricts the Court more and more
every year. However, by doing
this, they are helping further the
reputation. Thus, it is a double-
