THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 12, 1922

College students should work eight
hours and sleep eight hours, but not
the same eight hours.

Fresh Evans (knocking on 33
Georgia door)—“Eight o’clock. Eight
o'clock.”

Gallant (sleepily)—‘“Did you? Bet-
ter call a doctor.”

Oh, her name was Irene,

And she wore crepe de chene;
You could see more Irene

Than you could crepe de chene.

It is estimated that the habit of
rolling the,stocking has saved the
knock-kneed girls enough pairs of hose
to compensate for all the oculists’ bills
that the men have had to pay since the
idea became prevalent.

If a college has a good football team
it doesn’t worry a helva lot about what
becomes of the rifle team. .

campus, straightened up from his

“Boy, she’s so pretty that when she

a total loss.”

PRESBYTERIANS MEET

WAKE FOREST FOE

When the Davidson Wildcats, fresh
from their victorious 19-0 defeat by
Georgia Tech, ties up with Wake

Forest on Wearn Field Saturday it],

will be the 12th encounter of the two
teams. Of the 11 occasions upon
which the two have strugele i, the
Presbyterians have come off con-
quorers 10 times, while Dame Fortune
has smiled on the Baptists but once,
last year, when they provided the up-
set of the season by copping a 10-7
verdict.

Until the “miracle of miracles” hap-
pened last year the Red and Black had
all the best of the argument. They
not only collected 10 straight victories,
but they rolled up 239 points to Wake’s
38 in doing it. The scores, year by
year, follow:

1908, Davidson 31; Wake Forest 4
1910, Davidson 32; ‘Wake Forest 0
1911, Davidson 9; Wake Forest 0
1912, Davidson 13; Wake Forest 7
1913, Davidson 6; Wake Forest 0
1914, Davidson 7; Wake Forest 6
1915, Davidson 21; Wake Forest 7
1917, Davidson 72; Wake Forest 7
1919, Davidson 21; Wake Forest 0
1920, Davidson 27; Wake Forest 7
1921, Davidson 7; Wake Forest 10

246 48

It was in the years 712, '13, and ’14
that the Baptists gaye the Wildcats
their hardest scraps.. Each year they
had a heavier team and were confident

‘|of victory, but on every time the Red

and Black floated over the Old Gold
and Black.

Heckman, the outstanding star of
the Baptists, has been out of two
games this season. He made the All-
State last year and was the main fac-
tor in his team’s victory over the Wild-
cats. He carried the ball over for
Wake's touchdown and followed it by
kicking goal and finally won the game
by booting a 30-yard field goal.

The game will be the first of the sea-

son in Charlotte and a large crowd is|.

sure to be on hand.’ Both colleges have
large followings in the Queen City and
with the Davidson and Queens’ stu-
dent bodies on hand it is sure to be a
lively affair.

INTEREST IN GOLF IS
GROWING ‘AT DAVIDSON

Those interested in golf will be glad
to note that the work of cleaning up
the course is practically completed and
that inside of a week the course will be
in fair condition. So far unusual in-
terest has been shown and it is hoped
more will come out to take up the
game. :

Within the coming month the club
is planning to engage in two matches
with nearby teams. This will give a
line on the material for the year.

During the past few days many stu-
dents have had the privilege of seeing
Lieutenant Woodrow Clark, of Camp
Benning, perform on the course. He
is a Davidson graduate and a star golf
player, holding a high place in the
realm of excellent players. Those who

did not see him play will be interested

to know that on the first round he
turned in a 39, thus showing his skill
on the course.

The course is here for use and stu-
dents have the privilege of learning the
game without any expense whatever.
Take advantage of the opportunity, it’s
yours.

WORLD SERIES RETURNS
CREATE MUCH INTEREST
What is the cause of all this atten-

tion paid to the window of the White

Drug Company? What is it that

moves the Fresh to rush down at all

hours of the afternoon, take one wild-
eyed look at the window, and in the

same manner in which they came, re-
turn to report the results of their in-
vestigations? Did D. C. crush Georgia
Tech or did Arbuthnot fail to be the
first one in at breakfast? Why, don’t
you understand? The world series is
on between the “New York World”
and the “New York Herald.”

Some of the bolder ones in our midst
have even ventured to back up their
favorites in a decided financial way,
he same being detrimental to a marked
degree to the deposits of the boarding
house managers and the commissary.
Oh, well, the world series comes but
once a year, therefore, let joy and in-
terest be unconfined.
