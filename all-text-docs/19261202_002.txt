Realizing for the first time in many years
of football a championship of North Caro-
lina, the Davidson Wildcats have returned
conquerers to their lair. By decisively
trouncing Duke, while North Carolina State
for the second consecutive year surprised
Wake Forest with a defeat, Davidson won a
clear-cut claim to the title.

Before the contests of Turkey Day, the
Deacons and the Wildcats’ alone remained
undefeated within the borders of the Tar
Heel state. Both teams had licked Carolina,
and Davidson had won over State and the
Baptists from Duke. Davidson had suc-
cumbed to two Virginia elevens—Hampden-
Sidney and V. M. I., while the Deacons had
been downed by Furman and P. C., of
South Carolina. If memory serves us right,
early in the fall, when the Baptists won from
Carolina, they were acclaimed State Cham-
pions. And then we recall how the under-
rated Davidson Wildcats for the second con-

secutive season went to Charlotte and tied:

the “champions.” All in all the Wildcats
have had a highly successful season.

Various attempts have been made since
the Thanksgiving clashes, to attribute the
cause for Davidson’s wonder team. In no
wise would we attempt to detract in the
least from the worth of other elements that
certainly entered into the situation, but it
seems to us that the* most credit can be
handed on a silver platter to Coaches Young-
er and Tilson. Starting the present season
with a noticeable lack of material, these men-
tors have developed a team which would
give any in this section a hard tussle. These
men stated last spring that Davidson would
be indeed fortunate to win two games this
year in football. Well, perhaps, “Gloomy”
and “Morbid” are pertinent terms to use i
their connection.

n

Grey, Bohannon, and Boggs, of Davidson,
were placed on the composite all-state team.
The team was picked by a majority of the
sports writers and experts of the state—men
who had seen all the leading teams: of the
state play at least once. McConnell, Wild-
cat center, received several votes for the
pivot position and at least one for guard,
but was beat out by Schwartz, of Carolina.
Among other Davidson players who were
considered were Pinkney and Arrowood, ends,
and Ritchie,. tackle. There were probably
others also for not all of the selections have
reached this office.

Through the’ state, in the last few days,
there have appeared in many of the leading
dailies, praise and favorable comment for
Davidson. The team, the coaches, the subs,

and the general attitude of the student body, |

all have received notice. Certainly, the stu-
dent body, to a man, displayed the proper
Davidson spirit, last Friday morning when

it stood in the rain for half an hour at the coming week-end. The Wildcat link stars son College course at 2:00 p. m.

Three Assistants
Named in Football

The three Junior managers of the football
team for th next year have been chosen by
the Athletic Council. These men are Roger
Hall, A. C. Kelly, and C. H. Mauze. W. M.
Regen was chosen as alternate. It has been
the custom in the past for the Athletic Coun-
cil to elect both the Junior and Varsity man-
agers, but according to a new ruling insti-
tuted this fall, the Varsity managers of all
the teams will be elected henceforth by the
Athletic Council combined with those men
who make their letter in the respective sports.
Under this new. system, the election of the
Varsity managers is not left in the hands
of such a small number of persons, but is left
up to the judgment of those whom the man-
agership concerns most vitally. *

The Junior managers were elected Monday
night by ‘the Athletic Council, and the votes
for the election of the Varsity will more
than likely be cast by the team Saturday
morning, when next year’s captain. will be
elected.

This was the second appearance of
Queens organization on the “Hill” during
the past week, the Glee Club appearing here
in concert a week ago.

Following the call of Coach Younger and
Captain Anderson, the candidates for basket-
| ball have turned out in full force. Although
lite captain, Wilson, Simpson and Harrison,
| are the only letter men in school, the pros-

pects for a good team are much brighter now
j than they were a year ago. This is true in
spite of the fact that the present Sophomore
class failed to produce a real cage artist. A
great deal of the team’s strength will come
from last year’s “Cowboy” team and from
material developed in the class series.

A formidable schedule has been announced
for the wrestling team by Coach Weems.
The one big addition to the list of engage-
ments is a meet with the West Point Cadets
the first of, February. For years Davidson
has stood high with its grapplers, and boasts
one man, Frierson, who has not been thrown
during his college career except in an extra
time match. In addition to the completed
schedule several more meets are pending so
in all the Wildcat matmen will have a ‘full
season. The coach also plans to put out a
Freshman team this fall and the call for
candidats has been {ssued.

At the same time of the awarding of the
‘varsity letters by the Athltic Council, 16
Freshmen were awarded numerals for serv-
ices rendered on the team of ’30. These men
will be entitled to wear the “D. C.”

Although the Freshman team did not win
any games in the state, it completed the sea-
son with two wins and three defeats. De-
feats were administered to them by State
and. Duke Freshmen, and Blue Ridge Prep!
School. Victories were obtained over Pres- ,
byterian College and Furman Freshmen.

Although the Freshman team was not suc-

likelihood of turning out several men that |
will have chances to obtain berths on next
year’s varsity. This is especially true of
the line where several good players are to be

The Statesville team is in good shape, hav-
ing improved a great deal since their first
match with Davidson, and a good match ‘s
promised. The Davidson team will be com-
posed of, McGill, Love, Wolfe, Wilson, Mar-
tin, and Mills.

Since the last rain the greens have been
graded, several bad places which could not be
called natural hazards have been filled in,
and numerous other improvements have been
made. This should put the course in fairly
good condition for the match.
