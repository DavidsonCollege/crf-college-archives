Residew to Embark on World Tour:

Keyboardist Quits, No One Notices

By Freelove Upthumpa ,

Minus’ one, Residew--
Davidson’s own world-famous
classic rock band--announced
plans on Wednesday to tour the
globe. The gathering was held at
the Back Street Cafe, where the
Dew recently playcda bencefitcon-
certto raise moncy for treatment of
Paula Abdul fans. Drummer Joe
Binns said “like David St. Hubbins
once remarked, we’re touring the
world and clesewhere.” The band

Binns

plans to open the tourin London on
May 17 and will wrap up the ven-
ture in late August, 1993.
Guitarist Julian Cochran said,
“T think we’ll bea big hit in France.

Our disctinct mixture of Allman
Brothers with, well, Allman Broth-
ers, iS sure to get us in with the
espresso set.”

Asked if he was excited about
the trip, bassist Chip Petree re-
moved a pair of headphones and
exclaimed, “man! Ya’ ll gotta hear
this Phish!” Petree plans to pick up
some extra cash during the band’s
stay in Japan. “I’m gonna pose for
the dude who does all those little
statues of the Buddah,” he noted.

Brad Reddick, guitarist, invited
the press corps to come on tour
with the band. “You know, it’s
been such a long time since we’ ve
done anything together, and, you
know, I mean, work, and the band,
and, well, you know. Have you

guys got any cigarettes?” he said.

Several minutes into the con-
ference, someone in the back of the
room asked, “Hey, where’s that
other guy?” in reference to key-
boardist Will Percy. The members
of the band looked to their right, at
each other, the crowd, and then
just shrugged.

Binns was overheard saying to
Reddick, “I don’t know. I thought
you were supposed to watch him.”

After an intense investigation,
the Davidphonian has learned that
Percy was holding his own press
conference at Giorgio’s in Cor-
nelius. Apparently he told the’
waitress, “I’ ni leaving Residew for
good. This band just isn’t what it
was four years ago. These guys
actually give a damn about what
they’re doing. I can’t, and won’t
tolerate it anymore. Back in the
old days we meant something: we
wereacouple of guys whocouldn’t
really play, but did, and we caught
asweetbuzz. It’s just notthe same
anymore.”

He announced plans for a solo
album which he has tentatively
titled “Percy Speaks.” Percy has:
invited former Davidson students
William Bray, Chris Hargrove, and
Curtis Ravenel to work with him
on the project. The album should
be completed, in Percy’s words,
“whenever we get around to it.”

John Howell parties down with his new friend Cher at the Residew's press
conference. Of the relationship, Howell said, "I think she's very special, and

quite a dresser, too." Cher only said that she really missed Sonny

(Matt Bumrush: Screamin’ Metal

For this week’s installment I
have chosen to single out and sa-
lutea very differentand much better
form of music. For the past year J
have constantly bombarded you
with my relentless bantering about
the so-called joy and rapture of
country music. Finally, I had a
profound revelation: I’ve wasted a
hell of a lot of my time and used up
a lot of valuable ad-space in the
Davidsonian. | realized that after
putting hand to typewriter for the
past year that I have accomplished
essentially - nothing. The only
weckly comment I have gotten
about my article is from my par-
ents, with thcir restrained compli-
ments of “that’s nice dear, we
understand that country music is
your only real friend.” Imeanafter
listening and rambling about the
supposed heaven that awaits all in
that hell-pit Nashville, I finally
came to the conclusion that there is
another life besides country music
and Hee Haw. So, today I write to
you about the joy of metal.

The heavy metal scene can be
described as an open free-sex in-
cestuous family where there are
tears, cries of pain, and terror. It's
damn competitive, the best bands
get the best and cheapest women,
But the rewarding elements ofsuch
a society are incalculable, the fans
arealways included be itin the bed
of the artists are by their spending
money on metal biker jackets and
patches. The notion that metal
music offers only three general
themes-sex, drugs and cheap
women - may be true, but how
many of you would disagree that
these are vital elements of life?

The names of Slaughter, Met-
allica, Queensryche, Tora Tora,
Def Leppard, Iron Maiden, Skid
Row and Judas Priest ring through
my little-Tennessee head almost
everyday out of my Polk Audios.
But my total enthrallment and
rapture comes from just plopping
in either Use Your Illusion I or II

from Guns N’ Roses, sitting back

Bangin’ Heads
With My Pals m the Biz

in-your-face, genuine Pantera. I

with my electric guitar and just
trying to follow the Gunners
through a few tunes. I can’t
explain the. enthusiasm I felt
when I flipped through theJatest
issue of Hit Parader this month,
and saw an interview with my
pal Duff McKagan (bassist for _
Gn’ R forthose of youwhohave ,
had your cyes glued to TNN,
and who is a fricnd so I’ll just
call him Duffy from here on
out). Duffy and I go way back,
he and his family are from Mi-
ami (my former homctown be-
fore I was transplanted to the
armpit of the Southeast) and we
used to ride bikes up and down
the beach picking up babes, turn-
ing over trashcans and killing
kittens. Boy, those were the
days, feclings that I hope’ to
convey to my readers.

Well, Iet’s look at some as-
pects of the metal scene. First
Iet’s just remember the great
Motley Criic. Sure the group
will still be together but they just
won’ tbe the same without Vince
(Vince Neil that is, but I just call
him Vince because he isa friend).
I mean I believe the Criie will
continue to put out quality mu-
sic but it just willlack that Vince
touch. I’ve already spoken of
the women of metal, soI’ll move
on toareview of Pantera’s latest
release: A Vulgar Display of
Power. There are some killer
cuts on this disc such as “Live in
aHole” whichis justheavy, raw,

once asked guitarist Diamond
Darrell (who is a friend, so I
could ask him) if stardom had
turned out as he expected. He
responded, “Yeah, now I have
sex at least twice a night with
different women instead of just
the same one over and over like
it was back in Miami.”

Oh, to be a famous metal
