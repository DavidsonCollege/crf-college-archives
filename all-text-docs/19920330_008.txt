THE DAVIDSONIAN

OPINIONS

MONDAY, MARCH 30 1992

Modest Stillness and Humility

Good, Clean, Mindless Fun

While the less adventurous of
Davidson’s student body quietly
consumed their evening meal last
Thursday, a proud, distinct, and,
well, quite stupid few took to arms
in order to contest supremacy on
Patterson Court. In the midst of
the frenzied proceedings stood one
particularly obnoxious youth. He
was Clad, de rigueur, in a T-shirt
and jeans, as he yelled many and
varied insults at what seemed the
very top of his lungs. Backed by
his pledge-pinned cadre, the of-
fending upperclassman had few if
any reservations about loudly
reminding his opponents of their
marked inadequacies. When he
eventually turned up enmeshed in
a gaggle of fist-swinging goats,
many were seen hanging low their
swaying heads and commenting to
each other about those three sisters
who will let no fool escape.

I’m still not sure what came
over me before! got my ass kicked,
butdamn if it wasn’tarush. Ido so
hate to admit it, but I absolutely
love those asinine egg fights. How
they spruce up a spring afternoon.

The challenge usually begins
with a direct charge from one or
the other of the two rival fraterni-
ties on the court. Not much plan-
ning or strategy here, just an all-
out show of testosterone and stu-
pidity. Within seconds, both
houses are massed on the opposite
banks of the Patterson Court val-
ley, hurling whatever comes to
hand at the opposing throng.

“Careful youdon’t missnow,”
I yell, “you won’t get another shot
until July of 94!” Eggs zing and I
wince.

.. When’s the next party?” as

yolk splatters on my chest. (Al-
though good for absolutely noth-
ing else, the select committee’s
unsolicited and unfounded “rec

ommendations” make great taunt-
ing tools.)

Ah, the thrill of battle. My
judgment having taken a holiday
for the remainder of the afternoon,
I decided to chase a friend of mine
back towards his own house after
he had authoritatively tagged me
with some would-be poultry. About
two-thirds of the way up the hill, a
certain little voice sprang up: “Hey
there big fellah, don’tja think this
here’s just a wee bit foolish?” As
lagreed and prepared toturn away,
face hit ground, and all became a
blur.

Always preferring the fantasy
world in which I reside to reality, I
arose fromghe fray with my arms

enness remains strong. Too many people actas if fun and alcohol are in-
herently connected. Having a blast without getting rocked is indeed
possible; we all know this intellectually, but do not always act on it. A
dry campus is not the answer, for nothing could contribute more to the
appeal of the forbidden fruit and to the desire to drink off campus, thus
risking our lives and those of others on the streets. We simply must learn
to control our use of alcohol; its abuse contributes to thoughtless words

and horrifying actions.

Members of the administration and faculty have expressed concerns
similar to those I have listed, and consequently some students think the
administration wants to force puritanical morality onto students. [donot
believe this is acorrect interpretation of the administrations’s aims. The
trustees and employees of Davidson want what is best for the students,
yet their ideas of what will benefit us may differ from our own concep-
tions of what is best for the student body. We must demonstrate that we
are adult enough to make responsible decisions and act accordingly, as
acommunity, stop pointing fingers and being defensive, and address the
main issue; insensitivity, harassment, and assault have no place at

Davidson College.

based on hearsay, and some of their recommendations might not reflect
the wishes of most Davidson students, but by simply attacking the Select
Committee we neglect to emphasize the importance of learning from this
turbulent time and forgiving one another. Only when all is revealed and
forgiven can we truly call ourselves a compassionate community.

held high, as if I were the victor
outright. ‘“‘Hod-killer, slayer of
goats am I” did I chant, until sev-
eral of my own fraternity brothers
told me tokindly consider shutting
the hell up.

No! I am not a Phi Delt, nor
was meant to be;

Am an attendant mouth, one
that will do

To annoy a goat, piss off a hod
or two.

The best part of the fight,
though, doesn’t come until every-
one has run out of things to throw.
That’s when we all stand on our
respective hills and call each other
the p-word for forty five minutes.
College!

I would suspect that at just
about this point in thearticle, Bobby
C. Williams and the select com-
mittee crew are thinking to them-
selves, “A-ha! Case in point!
Finally, an actual incident to which
we can refer in our next report!” It
seems kinda vicious on the. sur-
face, now don’tit? However much
Thate toruin your favorite pastime
of only taking one side of the story,
I feel compelled to let you know
what happens after these grocery
wars: nothing. You see, even
though the houses on the court get
a bit wild every once in a while,
none of us take it too seriously. In
fact, less than an hour after Thurs-
day’s skirmish, I was laughing
about the event with the very same
goat who had tackled me into the
mud. At Warner Hall that night,
even the most.intense warriors of
the day were having a great time
with their afternoon enemies. A.
good time was had by all; oh, the
clock is a tickin’.

judgement. I am not saying that
everyone who finds fault with the
fraternity system should come
down to a party, but it is their re-
sponsibility to possess an informed
opinion before they condemn the
fraternity system. This under-
standing can be achieved through
participation in court activities,
attending a meal at one of the
houses, or simply entering into a
dialogue with the members of a
house. Regardless of the means, it
is clear more interaction needs to

-. take place between faculty and

Patterson Court in order to pro-
mote alucid, accurate understand-
ing of Davidson’s social environ-
ment.

David D. Smyth:
Artifice in Wooing:
Herrick Plays Hard

Editor’s note: This piece was
largely composed on December
10, 1991. The calendar-wise
among you will note that this
was one short day before the
mighty scheduled examination
for English 495. What was our
hero thinking while the mother
of all undergraduate literature
exams lurked around the cor-
ner? Was he thinking? Well,
probably not, but please humor
our boy and continue reading.

He goes on to say, “Wash,
dress, be brief in praying: / Few
beads are best when once we go
a-Maying.” What do you sup-
pose Herrick has in mind here?
Sex, methinks. Will Corinna be
strong and remember her South-
ern Baptist upbringing? Can she
possibly resist the poetic charms
of Suave Bob? Oh, dear reader,
do not abandon us now. Con-
tinue, I prithee.

“There’s not a budding boy
or girl this day / But is got up to
bring in May; /...Many a green-
gown has been given, / Many a
kiss, both odd and even.” How
fair our two heroes? Bob is pre-
senting his case pretty well, and
the title seems to indicate where
the whole scenario might end up.
Corinna’s probably going to get
that green gown pretty soon, but
from nothing so benign asarugby
game or some such sporting
mirth. Score one for the Bobster,
frat boy!

“To the Virgins, to Make
Much of Time” takes another
approach and lets Herrick urge a
wholesale abandonment of all
sexual mores. This scheme might
similarly assume that if a high-

Poets and others through-
out history and prehistory have
pursued women incessantly by
as many different means as pos-
sible. The English Romantic
poet Robert Herrick tried po-
etry with mixed success. Some
women were positively snowed
by his urgent implorations; oth-
ers saw right through the sordid
game.

Bob used the carpe diem
theme with “Corinna’s Going
A-Maying” in 1648, a particu-
larly daring effort since the focus
was necessarily on one fair
maiden, Corinna. (No, these
poems are not one-size-fits-all,
dear readers. It would not be as .

pened by he would simply have Herrick opens appropriately

witha blast: “Gather yerosebuds
while ye may, /Old timé is still a-
flying; / And this same flower
that smiles today, / Tomorrow
will be dying.” Ah-hah! Make
her feel like’ she’s missing some-
_ thing that she won’t long enjoy
because of her withering physi-
cal female frame. A sensitive
poet, at last! Thisishardly PC but
Bob likely had little use for such
trivialities in his writing and
wooing prime. The modem reader
has to admire old Bob for his
unabashed honesty if nothing
else. It’s spring; he’s horny and
out to deflower and makes no
- bones about it. Some of us should
do so well.
Fire your charms where you

out of whack and no self-re-
specting seventeenth-century
nymph would buy that for a
second. “Elizabeth’s Going A-
Maying?” Perish the thought.)

Let us examine some par-

in convincing Corinna to throw
fate to the wind and really go a-
maying. He begins with out-
right commands: “Get up! get
up for shame! the blooming
morn/ Upon her wings presents
the god unshorn.” [Note to’
female readers: would you ap- -
preciate or tolerate this kind of
authoritarian you’re-my-babe
crap as an opening line? If so,

get thee to the Davidsonian edi- may, Bob. 344 years later we

purpose on this campus. Honor knows no limits; ithas no boundaries.

I regret that my first correspondence to you as Chairman has to be
one of this nature. I know that we are all dealing with difficult times
on this campus. More than ever before, we must look to our duties to
this community and join together to strengthen any frayed ties that
exist. I am proud to be a member of this student body as we work to
rebuild the community, stronger than it has ever been, I thank you for
your cooperation, and I will stay in touch with you in a concentrated
effort to keep you-increasingly involved in the Honor System.
