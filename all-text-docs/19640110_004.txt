Reynolds Lecturer Speaks
On Civil Rights, Poverty

BY BILL FOSTER

Violating the first rule of
good journalism, that of being
short, decisive. and to the point,
Reynolds Lecturer Ralph Mc-
Gill displayed a gentleness in
his answers that he does not
usually have in bis role as the
publisher. of the Atlanta Con-
stitution.

In a session before televis-
ion cameras Wednesday morn-
ing, McGill discussed subjects
ranging from the role of the
churches in the civil rights
battle to police brutality. Me-
Gill said that up until two
years ago churches had not
“grasped the need to partici-
pate” in civil rights. “With a
few noteble exceptions,” he
maintained, “churches’  re-
sponses have been terribly
late and generally lacking pur-
pose.”

In answering a query on po
lice brutality, his main conten:
tion was that although its exis-
tence was “unquestionable”
there was very little one could
do about it because it often took
place in private or in semi-priv-
ate and was thus extremely hard
to prove in a court of law.

Classifying Governor Wallace
of Alabama as “unpredictable.”
he went on to relate how the
late President's assassination
had apparently caused Wallace
to “rethink some of his posi-
tions.”

McGill began his main lec-
ture Wednesday night by pro-
fessing his “deep affection for
this region” and stating that
once the South solved the “great
travail of the srea—the race
problem—a door will open for
us.” Calling the race question
an “existential” one or one of
the “now,” he recommended
that people forget the causes
and press on toward the solu-
tion.

McGill s2'd thet the 1954 Su-
preme Court decision on inte-
gtation of the schools was not
the surprise that some South-
ermers seemed to think it was,
and he cited several suits and
indications prior to that decis-
ion which pointed the way to it.

He placed great emphasis on
the role that education must
play if the South is going to
compete industrially with the

rest of the nation. He spoke of
the poor quality of Southern
education that resulted in so
‘many draftee rejections from
states of this area.

Another theme he emphasiz-
ed while here is the urgency
of the slum problem. “Some
thing has got to be done to get
the third generation out of the
big city slums,” he said. “Too
often these people in the slums
are Negroes from the South who
went North with no skills and
have remained in the big city
with no jobs and no future.”

YMCA Initiates Program|

For Negro Education

BY JOHN BAILEY

The Davidson YMCA is ini-
tiating an educational program
to broaden the scholastic oppor-
tunities of high school Negro
boys in the Davidson area.

This program has two goals:
“(1) to aid and inspire the more
capable students to deeper and
more meaningful high school ex-
perience. with the hope more
will then pursue college; (2) to
equally aid those who lack aca-
demic interest, with the hope
that they will remain in high
school for a diploma.”

Pilot. sessions, lasting about
an hour and a half each, will
begin immediately after semes-
ter break. In these sessions the
students will be exposed to
some special aspects of educa-
tion in the hopes of providing
a stimulus for further work.

Hach college student will be
responsible for two or three
of the students and will provide
tutoring help for them through-
out the second semester.

‘The success of the entire
undertaking depends upon hav-
ing a sufficient number of vol-
untary tutors,” Joe Howell,
YMCA president, said.

In these meetings the college
tutors will have a personal con-
tact which is hoped will es-
pecially benefit and interest the
high school student. A study

The sign reading “Special Sale—Jackets—Were
$5.75, Now Only $5” announces another “good deal”
at the Stud, the renovated, improved, expanded Student
Store, now doing business in its exclusive new location:

Union, South Wing. .

After-Christmas sales have
reaped undreamed-of profits for
this aspect of Shaw Smith's
Union enterprise. One can see
for himself. Just pass by the
Stud en route to the game room:
the latest sale left only bare
shelves—not even a stray price
tag to be seen.

Aotually the vacant 200 feet
of shelf space never held a
coveted Davidson beer mug nor
any other item of Stud com-
merce. It was intended to hold
the literary offerings of the
Knovel Knook as well as the
burden of J. T. Kimbrough's
high-price textbooks. The ex-
pected move of both book stores,
scheduled to transpire during
Thankogiving and later resched-
uled to occur during the Christ-
mas holidays, -proved, like the
imaginary ‘beer mug sale (Who
drinks beer at Davidson?), to be
unfounded rumor.

Hopefully, the Knovel
Knook will be moved to its
new home sometime this
spring and the textbooks can
be transferred “according to
schedule” this summer. Again,
the schedule may be revised
or prove mere rumor. Accord-
ing to Smith, however, the de-
‘lay is made in the students’

problem. “The present plan,”
explained Smith, “is to find one
man who will be willing to over-
see all four functions in Union,
South Wing: Stud, textbook
store, Knovel Knook, and game
room—and meet the administra-
tion’s approval.”

Union, South Wing. is to be
more than a merchandise mart.
“It will become a rallying point
for student recreation and a
browsing corner for those in-
terested in art, music, or books,”
said Smith optimistically.

SALUTE: JACK ASCHERL

In less than a year, Jack Ascherl (B.S., Business, 1962)
has turned in outstanding performances on four different
assignments with Southern Bell in Pompano Beach, Florida.

As a Commercial Supervisor, he’s run a section of a
business office with leeway to make his own decisions. And
then, as Public Relations Coordinator, he improved the

PR program for his district. —
Next followed increased responsibility —Jack was told

to find methods of improving collection procedures, a job

where he saw 18 of his recommendations accepted and
used, And this led to a key troubleshooting assignment on
which Jack found ways to tighten up security procedures
in the tellers’ sections of the district offices.

To Southern Bell, Jack is a man who gets things done!

Jack Ascherl, like many young men, is impatient to
make things happen for his company and himself. There
are few places where such restlessness is more welcomed
or rewarded than in the fast-growing telephone business.

1964: YEAR OF DECISION

Well sir, here we go into 1964, which shows every sign of being
euite a distinguished year. First off, it is the only year since
1954 which ends with the Figure 4. Of course, when it comes
to Figure 4’s, 1964, though distinguished, can hardly compare
with 1444 which, most people agree, had not just one, not just
two, but three Figure 4’s! This, I'll wager, is a record that will
stand for at least a thousand years!

1444 was, incidentally, notable for many other things. It
was, for example, the year in which the New York Giants
plaved the Philadelphia Athletics in the World Series. As we
all know, the New York Giants have since moved:to San Fran-
cisco and the Philadelphia Athletics to Kansas City. There is
f& movement afoot at present to move Chicago to Phoenix—
the city, not the baseball team. Phoenix, in turn, would of
couree move to Chicago. It is felt that the change would be
broadening for residents of both cities. Many Chicago folks,
for example, have never seen an iguana. Many Phoenix folks,
on the other hand, have never seen a frostbite.

>
NalO-mcuded !

There are, of course, certain difficulties connected with a
muaicipal shift of this sige. For instance, to move Chicago
you also have to move Lake Michigan. This, in itself, presents
no great problem, what with modern scientific advances like
electronics and the French cuff. But if you will look at your
map, you will find Lake Michigan is attached to all the other
Great Lakes, which in turn are attached to the St. Lawrence
Seaway, which in turn is attached to the Atlantic Ocean. You
start dragging Lake Michigan to Phoenix and, willy-nilly, you'll
be dragging ail that other stuff too. This would make our
British allies terribly cross, and I can’t say as I blame them.
Put yourself in their place. What if, for example, you were a
British costermonger who had been saving and scrimping all
year for a summer holiday at Brighton Beach, and then when
you got to Brighton Beach there wasn’t any ocean? There you'd
be with your inner tube and snorkel and nothing to do all day
but dance the Lambeth Walk. This, you must agree, would not
help make you NATOQ-minded!

I appeal most earnestly to the residents of Chicago and
Phoenix to reconsider. I know it’s no bowl of cherries going
through life without ever seeing an iguana or a frostbite, but
I ask you—Chicagoans, Phoenicians—is it too big a price to
pay for preserving the unity of the free world?

I feel sure that if you search your hearts, you will make the
right decision, for all of us—whether we live in frostbitten
Chicago, iguona-infested Phoenix, ‘or narrow-lapelled New
Haven—are first and foremost Americans!

But I digress. We were speaking of 1964, our new year. And
new it is! There is, for one thing, new pleasure in Marlboro
Cigarettes. How, you ask, can there be new pleasure in
Marlboros when that fine flavorful blend of tobaccos, that clean
efficient Selectrate filter, have not been altered? The answer is
simple: each time you light a Marlboro, it is like the first time.
The flavor is such that age cannot wither nor custom stale.
Marlboro never palls, never jades, never dwindles into dull
routine. Each puff, each cigarette, each pack, each carton,
makes you glad all over again that you are a Marlboro smoker!

Therefore, Marlboros in hand, let us march confidently into
1964. May good fortune attend our ventures! May serenity
reiqn! May Chicago and Phoenix soon recover from their dis-

in extending good wishgs for a happy and peaceful 1964.
