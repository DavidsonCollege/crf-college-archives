Mazursky presents honest portrait

By PATRICK COVINGTON
Staff Writer

Making artistic statements about
artists is dangerous business in terms
of retaining integrity. There is always
the peril of either exalting the artist
and his work on too grand a scale, or
lapsing into self-pity; after all, unless
the artist was lucky enough to start at
the top, he has undoubtedly had some
hard knocks along the way, and may
feel the need to strike back.

Fortunately, this is a trap which
Paul Mazursky has managed to avoid
in his latest film, Next Stop, Green-
wich Village. Thematically, the film is
as humble as Mazursky’s beginnings,
seeking neither to idolize or pity
creativity. But it is a spirited and
exuberant work, a kind of portrait of a
young man as a clown, and therefore
an artist.

Perhaps one of the main reasons
why Mazursky avoids many possible
mistakes is the compactness of his
world. Any sort of battle between
artist and society is secondary to

battles between artists, and between

the artist and himself. For the most
part, the film takes place within the
confines of the Village, a world of
crowded coffee shops and cluttered,
often depressing flats. The characters
are mostly ‘“‘insiders’’ in the Village
by virtue of being ‘‘outsiders”’ every-
where else.

@Mazursky’s script, which is some-
what autobiographical, follows the
fortunes of Larry Lapinsky (Lenny
Baker), a kid from the Brownsville
section of New York who heads off to
the Village to seek his fortune as an
actor. Thus the film could be seen as

an initiati n eset oscar that Maz-
eg "¢, ye Pe.

Next Stop,
Greenwich Village

ursky eliminates Larry’s entrance
into Village life: one minute he’s
leaving his parents’ home, the next he
seems fully integrated into the Village
with his.own circle of friends or, at
least, acquaintances.

These include his young girlfriend |

who is alternately shrewd and inno-
cent, a strangely aloof playwright,
and a neurotic gay who tries to escape
his stigma by fashioning an impres-
sive background for himself.

Their alliance as a group is an
uneasy, often shaky one; their com-
mon foe is the desperation and.
hopelessness they all feel. As they
literally dance off to. rescue a compat-
riot after one of her innumerable

f suicide attempts, the whole episode

takes on the aspect of a ludicrous

‘aa game, an attempt to avoid reality.

The film’s crises come when the

reality can’t be kept away, and comes
i crashing in-over their flimsy defenses.

The tilm is seen mainly through the
eyes of Larry and he seems to typify

- the predicament of his world, the

Greenwich Village of the early Fifties.

» character which his acting teacher

¥ ever to have any serious chance of

becoming an actor. One gets the
impression that Mazursky strongly
disagrees with this, as the view of

. Larry’s creativity which he gives us

often takes on the aspect of the
burlesque.

Relevance brings youth to

By JASON NOBLE
‘Staff Writer

Once again the spirit ascends and
I’m transformed into Staff Writer,
the mysterious being (right) who
‘lurks in the shadows and writes this
article. Once again, against insur-
mountable obstacles, another reveiw
comes forth, declaring the word,
giving new insights, and putting my

name in the paper (I’m only doing this .

for my grad. school application).

One major theme that can usually
be found in most any comic book is
the importance of the individual; that
is, it is possible for one man/woman
to bring about a definite alteration of
the existing conditions by their own
capabilities.

It would be false to say that
teamwork does not exisi in comics
(e.g. Fantastic Four, JLA) but it
must be conceeded (I refuse to be
proven wrong) that it is the unique
and singular personality that ulti-
mately decides the outcome (e.g.
Avengers #145). With this in mind,
this week’s reveiw focuses on the
“‘loners’’.

Conan the Barbarian:
famous of Robert

The most
Howard’s

characters, Conan has seen great
success and well deserves it. A
hulking savage from the north, Conan
pretty much makes his own rules and
is usually quite consistent in seeing
them followed.

A quick temper and a quicker
swordhand are his two most noticable
characteristics, though every so often
a subtle showing of other qualities can
be discovered (such as turning white
upon seeing sorcery and making
passes at local bar girls).

As for the comic itself, consistently
acceptable artwork and easily read
dialogue are the standouts. The
stories lack the originality of the
earlier issues (this due mostly to the
lack of Barry Smith as penciller) but
for pure escapist reading without any
relevancy whatsoever, it’s still one of
the better titles out.

Red Sonja: A feminine Conan. To
all you woman’s libbers, better luck
next time (this one is too beat!).

Batman: There exists the possibil-
ity that there is no other figure in
comic books that has more potential
than the Batman. Created during the
last days of the pulps (and one of the
reasons for their demise), fashioned
after the likes of the Shadow, the

Spider, and Doc Savage, the Batman
has remained the prototype of the
loner superhero.

A sinister spectre of the night, one
couldn’t be sure whether he truly
acted out of a feeling of justice or
because he just enjoyed scaring the
shit out of people. However, with the
arrival of Robin, the aura of mystery
was somewhat dissolved.

During the ‘‘Golden Age” Batman
stepped out of the night into the light
of day and, gaining greater appeal,
turned into the pure hearted friend of
the common man; one giant leap for
profits, one greater leap for medio-
cracy. (This couldn’t be the same man
who pumped 4 bullets into the inert
‘““Monk”’.) :

This pathetic state of affairs

managed to perpetuate it’s unworthy

self until the advent of the ‘‘Era of
Relevancy’’ (don’t take this too
seriously).

At this time (a blurry transition
period taking place somewhere be-
tween 1968 and 1972 (remember what

The film resembles Fellini’s 8%
with its emphasis on dreams, which
we either see through Larry’s mind,

Ny or through reality: one particularly

memorable scene has Larry on a

H deserted railroad platform doing an
imitaton of Brando’s Stanley Kow-

alski. Lenny Baker as Larry is stri-
kingly clown-like with his angular
face and gangling movements.

One of the main ingredients of
Larry’s dreams—and his night-
mares—is his mother, portrayed by
Shelley Winters in what has to be one
of her. finest performances to date. At
base her character is familiar stock:
the worrying Jewish mother. But
Winters manages to elaborate on the
charactér and to give it three dimen-
sions.

As always, she is effective as a
presence—important in this film—
but she also elicits your sympathy as
a human: being. The performances by
those portraying Larry’s friends are
very good, especially Ellen Greene as
Sarah, his wisecracking but vulner-
able girlfriend, and Christopher Wal-
ken as Robert, the playwright who, as
Larry once comments, is ‘‘all sur-
face’. Outstanding in a small role is
Jeff Goldblum as an actor with a
formal schooling background who is
competing with Larry for a film role.
His frustration at finding his back-
ground to be largely useless is effec-
tively brought across.

Mazursky’s screenplay is not fault-
less: it sometimes threatens to sink
into pathos. But whenever that
danger arises, Mazursky’s taut
direction and Baker’s fine perform-
ance manage to keep things afloat.
The mood of the film’s ending is
tantalizingly ambiguous and is test-
imony to the honesty that character-
izes the whole work. For Mazursky,
the artist is neither hero nor victim,
but is merely a human being trying to
overcome reality with laughter and
beauty.

happened than, don’t you?) the
publishers discovered that by putting
political comment (slight though it
was ) into their stories they obtained a
whole new audience: the radical
youth.

The social relevance was at first as
subtle as a mack truck on a wet night,
but soon a new breed of writing was
conceived. Abrassive bluntness was
replaced by a refinement, close to
satire, that restored a fantastic
atmosphere while keeping editorial
comment.

In the midst of this renaissance
Batman recaptured some ‘of his lost
eeriness, the shadowy. demon who’s
very name could instill panic into the
hearts of the underworld was again on
the prowl.

However, as luck (and probably
sales) would have it, all this was to
pass. The Batman is once more one of
the ‘‘goodguys’’, yet every so often
the fog creeps in, wooden planks
squeak under some unknown weight
and the Batman stalks in the night.

Mark Armstrong and Lillian Gascoigne are accepting:
contributions. of poetry, photography, and original art:

for Inside Art which will run next week.
