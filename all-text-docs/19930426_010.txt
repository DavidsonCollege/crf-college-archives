"Mad Dog" Sobon Send

By John Holmes

Following Saturday’s
devastaing15 inning loss to the
Miami Hurricanes under the hot
Florida sun in the regional finals of
the college baseball tournament,
Coach Dick Cooke found himself
inaproblem. The Cat’s were one
game away from their first ever
trip to the College World Series,
but had been dealt a crushing loss,
6-5, tp the Hurricanes which left
Cooke with no remaining pitchers.
As he stepped out of the dugout, he
gazed into the crowd, fending off
the glaring sun, realizing he was
getting ready to coach possibly the
biggest game of his career, He had
a searching look for something to
possibly fall from the sky and save
him, then he saw his ticket to ride.
The most loyal fan throughout the
season was in the stands, a former
pitcher whose recurring shoulder
problem had kept him off the
mound was there again, Tim “Mad
Dog” Sobon.

Cooke asked him if he had
enoughstrength to gonine innings.
Sobon, who gothis nickname from
his favorite beverage, figured he
could do anything after15 innings
and three bottles, and said simply
“Sure.” Mad Dog took a few warm
up pitches and headed to. the
mound. He wasasight to watchas
he stumbled to the mound, insist-
ing on wearing his Mickey Mouse

hat, with a pink tank top, his favor-
ite cut-off slacks from freshman
year’s 70’s party, along with his
worn out docksiders. His eyes
were bloodshot with a thin glaze
and his lips were bright orange
from an early afternoon Orange
Jubilee.

Before he even got to throw

his first pitch, he had his first argu-.

ment with the umpire. The umpire
said that Sobon would not be al-
lowed tocarry his Florida Marlin’s
thermos to the mound, but Sobon
put it simple “If it goes, I go.” So
he started to pitch, baffling the
Hurricane batters by mixing up not
only pitches, but form as well.
Sobon mastered the standard form
by mixing fastballs with sliders
and change-ups along with the side-
armed form mastered by the great
Dennis Eckersley. After each
strikeout, the K-Korner would
stand up another empty bottle on
top of the dugout, Sobon would
amass an amazing 10 strikeouts on
the day. “I’ve never seen a pitcher
with so many different talents,”
said Hurricane Manager. The game
stood at0-0 after 5 inningsas Sobon
scattered only 6 hits.

In the 6th inning the game’s
first possible bench clearer oc-
curred, but all action was over be-
fore anyone couldreach the mound,
First baseman Clay Hall went up to
bat and was hit by a pitch. Hall

proceeded to charge the mound,
knocking out the pitcher and plac-
ing the catcher on his butt, there
were no other challengers. Unfor-
tunately, the pitcher was rushed to
the hospital, and it was later deter-
mined he will be a vegetable for
the rest of his life. When asked
about the incident after the game
Hall simply said, ”The cutie pie
Stranger hit me with the baseball,
so I hit him with my fist. I guess I
should send him a card, I love
baseball.” The game would then
enter the 8th inning, still a 0-0
ballgame, with Davidson dodging
some huge bullets, but only mass-
ing 2 hits for the offensive cause.

Inthe bottom of the 8th, Sobon
was still in the game, despite close
calls in between innings when it
appeared he mightpass out. Buthe
would face his closest call of the
afternoon. With men on first and
second and only one out, the um-
pire called time and went to the
mound to speak with “Mad Dog.”
The ump asked to see Sobon’s hat

‘as he noticed a shine on his bill,

and the ump quickly identified. the
substance as Vaseline. Sobon ex-
plained that the vaseline was not
used to aid his pitching, but was
there for personal reasons. Due to
a confused umpire, Sobon was
forced to demonstrate to the um-
pire and all spectators that wished
to view as he followed in the foot-

steps of his idol, DavidCone. Once
he was done he requested a short
nap. The umpire simply said, “Get
your ass back on the mound.”
Sobon, as a result of sudden fa-
tigue and anger allowed 1 run to
score and the Cats entered the 9th
down 1-0 with 3 outs left.

Finally the bats woke up for
Davidson as Rick Bender hit a 2
run homer that traveled over 450
yards, driving in pinch hitter Will,
the bat boy, who reached on an
error. The Cats were up 2-1 going
into the bottom of the 9th. The
game rested on the shoulders of
Sobon, who obvoiusly had no idea
of what was going on and probably
wouldn’t until the next day, as he
strutted to the mound for the last
three outs.

The first batter flied out to
left, the second struck out, falling
for the old submarine style pitch,
leaving the Cat’s one out from the
College World Series. Sobon
commited three intentional walks,
despite what Coach Cooke had to
Say, just to add to the drama. The
final batter came up to the plate, an

s Baseball to College World Series

All-American rightfielder. Sobon '
tooka swig from histhermos, cring-
ing as is gushed down his throat,
and set up to pitch shaking of all
catcher Brett Boretti’s signs until
Boretti signaled for the
“Thunderbird” pitch.

He took one more swig, and
lined up delivering the pitch as the
batter set to swing, drilling the ball
straight back to Sobon. With no
time to duck, and his reactions
slightly impaired, Sobon stood in
shock as the ball got nearer and ©
nearer, ultimately hitting him di-
rectly in the stomach as his whole
body folded inward and hit the
ground. After impact, his body
sprung out like a spring as the ball
went straight up, and came straight
down, landing in hislap. Out three.
Sobon complained of shortness of
breath for several hours and team-
mates complained of his vomit,
consisting of different bright col-
ors, which sprayed over everyone
during the pile-upcelebration. Mad
Dog Sobon, the new Davidson
hero, give him a bottle the next
time you see him.

You Can Be A KA, Too!

The brothers of Kappa Alpha Order thought we'd let the rest of the campus in on a little
secret. This is the photo we use to decide who's good enough to join our house. If you're a
_ guy and you dress like the stunning looking fellow in the photo above, then you, too, can

be a "knight" of the Kappa Alpha Order. This is no joke.

It may not be much of a standard to judge by, but who cares? The soccer team is in our

frat. (Note the ball and shoes the young man in the middle is holding and wearing, ,
respectively!)
