The Davidson community has
been snocked this past week by
a series of killings that have
taken place in plain view of the
campus population, beginning
Monday, April 24, with the mur-
der of Antonio ‘“‘Tony the Ti-
ger” Abbottelli. Shot down be-
fore the eyes of his studenis,
Davidson faculty member Ab-
bottelli, long known to be a
“capo” in the fam:]y of Roberto

“Kayrat” Campanello, was dead
on arrival at the Mooresville
Veter‘nary Hospital.

Though Abbottelli was known
to ke running numbers among
his students, author:t:es specu-
late that his murder is lirked in
a “hit ke hit’ circle of venge-
ance with the d'scovery last
weekend of the body of Gino
“No-Mind” Scallopini in the
Johnston Gym_ pool, where it
had been for approximately two
weeks.

Eyewitnesses to the murder
shared a feeling of disbelief over
the disruption of the class by
three _ submachine-gun toting
hoods and a gunman disguised
as a student, who calmly shot
Abbottelli twice through the
chest.

“It was terrible,” said Terry
Hirst, a class-member. ‘‘It was
tne second worst thing I’ve seen
in a week.”

Abbottelli’s mu:der was fol-
lowed hard upon by the slaying
of Stephano “The Lip” Bara-
gona in the Davidson cafeteria
on Mcnday afternoon. The as-
sassin, identified as Georgie
“The Shnoz” Draughonetti, was
gunned down in turn by Bara-
gona’; henc.men. This killing is
the authorities’ first nk of Don
Guappo Lasagna with the car-
nage. Mr. Lasagna was unavail-
able for comment.

In the course of this week,
the Davidson community has
witnessed the murders of Bruno
“The Pug” So:rentino, Terry
Hirst, and, in the midst of a
Senate meeting, the Honorable
Senator William ‘‘Payola” Rol-
land:no. Except for the Hirst
murder, which, authorities say.
may somehow be associated
with recent activities in the
Cunningham Fine Arts Building.
all these killings seem part of
the larger picture that the po-
lice are trying to piece togeth-
er. More killings, acco:ding to
Pol:ce Chief Sec. Off. Socolubi.
seem imminent.

The Faculty Senate at Appalachian State University
has devised a plan for the faculty to evalute the univer-
sity’s administrators. This plan is similar to an already
existing student evaluat‘on of the faculty. Included in
the evaluation of the administration are Appalachian’s
president, his assistants, the four university vice presi-
dents, seven deans and their assistants and 26 depart-

ment chairmen.

On the evaluation form, a faculty member will, for
example, grade his department chairman on a one-to-ten
scale on his administrative skills which include abilities
such as understanding others’ points of view, handling
conflicts, involving colleagues in the process of decision
making, and the promotion of academic encouragement
of independent expression. Max Dowell, Faculty Senate
chairman, commented: “I hope this will be the begin-
ning of a process by which we can help administrators
here upgrade the quality of their work.”

Wake Forest Faces Book Stealing Crisis

Approximately 5,000 books are missing from the
library at Wake Forest University, librarian Merrill Ber-
throng reported after a complete inventory during spring
break. Since the last inventory of the campus library was
undertaken five years ago, book stealing has increased
100 per cent. Berthrong added that the library is replac-
ing 1,000 old books each year and is spending approxi-
mately $10,000 in the process.

Berthrong said that the library might be forced to adopt
more restrictive means to prevent theft. He mentioned
an electronically controlled turnstyle located at each
library exit as a poss:ble measure. These turnstyles are
able to detect books that have not been checked out and
will block anyone possessing these books from leaving

the library.

Liza Minelli’s Performance Excels In ‘Cabaret’

A .REVIEW
By BOB WRIGHT
Steff Writer
An awful lot of-hubbub has
ensued over Liza MineHi’s vir-

tuoso pefformance in the film -

of ‘‘Cabaret” by Robert Fosse
(pronounced Fossey). And all
this attention is certainly de-
served; Liza Minelli is simply
superb.

In fact she is almost tov good
for the role of Sally Bowles, a
second-rate singer in a th-rd
rate Berlin cabaret of the 1930's
Her musical numbers, all of

waich take place in the Kit Kat
Klub, are all dynamite. Her
voice sparkles end shines and
sometimes just spills out all
ove? us. :

But in all this aforementioned
hubbub over Miss Minelli the
film itself has either been com
pictely igro.ed or dismissed as
not be:ng geod enough to keep
up with its female lead.

True, the film has its prob
lems, but its good pomis are
also considerable. Robert Fosse
has tricd fairly hard to make
the film more than just a mu-

sical, and so it is.

Joel Grey as the cabaret MC
is a vision of chalky-faced deca-
dence and leering vulgarity. He
is seen only in the cabaret mu-
sical scenes, but he somehow
pervades the whole of the film.
His reptilian eyes seem to be
watching from around every
corner.

The plot is taken from Chris-
topher Isherwood’s 1934 novel,
Berlin Stories. The hero, of
sorts, is Brian Roberts, an Eng
lish teaching student from Ene-
land who comes to Berlin to

study, meets Sally Bowles, is
plunged into her life of ‘‘divine
decadence,” knocks her up, falls
in love with her, discovers that
she has had an abortion, and
splits, roughly in that order.

When Sally and Brian are ar-
gu'ng over a mutual friend, Max,
“Screw Max!” comes up in the
conversation. ‘I do” says Sally,
“So do I,” Brian replies. Sub-
tle, huh?

Still the film never gets cute.
Fosse has captured the edge of
madness. It is Naziism which.

like an obnoxious odor in the
theatre, hangs heavily in the air
of-the film.

Director Fosse’s opening and
closing image is of the cabaret
audience (and vicariously our-
selves) grossly reflected in a
disto:ted mirror. And the film
deals chiefly in reflections, false
surfaces, gay facades.

Berlin in the 30’s, rising Nazi-
ism, the “‘last-desperate fling”
atmosphere is evoked with little
sympathy and less pity. It is a
tough film, and, I feel, a good
one.
