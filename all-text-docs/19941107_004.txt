NAMES quilt

to arrive
_ Thursday

By Beth Bacon

On November 10 through 13,
the NAMES Project AIDS Memo-
rial Quilt is coming to the Davidson
College campus. At the opening
ceremony on November 10th at
7:30 p.m., the panels will be un-
folded, and the names of people
represented by the panels will be
read aloud by such notables as
Mayor Vinroot of Charlotte, Mayor
Knox of Davidson, and former
mayor of Charlotte Harvey Ghantt.

Several prominent Davidson
alumni will also be reading names:
AIDS Educator Samuel Johnson
and founder of the Gay Mens’s
Health Crisis Jim Pepper.

"Missy Kuykendall, Dean of
Faculty Bob Williams, Dean of
Students Tom Shandley, and lead-
ers from the arts, religous, and
civic communities of Charlotte will
read as well.

Assistant Director for Union
Programs Sherry Malushizky and
Union Board President Nat May
are responsible for the Quilt’s ar-
rival. After a long application pro-
cess, the Quilt was approved to
come to Davidson.

According to Senior Eleanor
Hatcher, there are “definitely more
than 200 Davidson students” vol-
unteering to help with the Quilt.
Hatcher and Union Director Will-
iam Brownare responsible for find-
ing volunteers. Hatcher also says
that there is “a good turnout of
faculty, staff, and members of the
Davidson community. We thank
everyone who has participated.”
However, if anyone who has not
already voiced an interest in help-
ing would like to, volunteers are
still needed. ;

The entire quilt covers 1 1 foot-
ball fields and represents only 12
percent of the people in the United
States who have died of AIDS.
Local panels and panels of col-
lege-age people have been re-
quested, among others, to come to
Davidson. There will be approxi-
mately 460 individual panels on
display. “I think it is going to be a
really emotional event for every-
one who comes,” says Hatcher,
because the Quilt is “something
that is so relevant to such a central
part of our lives today.”

AIDS Educator Michael
Kennedy spoke in Phi Hall last
Thursday. He intended to bring an
AIDS patient with him to the meet-
ing,*but the patient fell very ill at
the last minute and was unable to
attend.

The Health Fair is taking place
on Wednesday, November 9. On
the same theme, but not directly
related to the Quilt, Dr. Ruth
Westheimer is speaking on
Wendesday, November 10in Love
Auditorium.

A fashion-show benefit is tak-
ing place on Saturday, November,

12 in the 900 Room, It is spon-
sored by SGA, BSC, ISA, Patterson
Court, FLAG, and SERCH. Ap-
proximately 75 models, represent-
ing over 30 organizations, are par-
ticipating in the show. “We want
the fashion show to be a fun, light-

hearted, inclusive event for the’

whole campus after having viewed
the Quilt for a few days,” says Zac
Lacy, a FLAG representative who
is helping with the publicity for the
show. “It will be a good way to
release tension.”

“Tt is an honor that the Quilt is
coming to our campus,”, Hatcher
says. “I think it would be a real
shame to have it come and have
anyone miss it. I’m so excited!”

School nominates 4 students for Watson

By Mary Clare Jalonick

As Davidson seniors begin to
worry abouthigh-paying jobs, pres-
tigious graduate schools, and fi-
nancial needs, some students look
ahead to next year and want to
immerse themselves in a different
kind of environment. Seniors -
Rachel Newcomb, Phoebe Dean,

Milica Tomasevic, and Charlie
Polster all

seek
pursue
their own
unique in-
terests
and gain
all they
can from
their post-
graduate

studies.

All four are candidates for the
Watson Fellowships, a program
that issues around 50 grants of
$15,000 each year to students
around the country. The students
must study abroad for a year; each
student proposes his or her own
field of study.

What Makes Watson Unique

The Fellowships, begun in
1968 and now chaired by a
Davidson graduate, are awarded to
students from 50 schools around
the country. Each year a commit-
tee of 10 Davidson faculty mem-
bers chooses four Davidson nomi-
nees, then each of the four must
submit his or her proposal to the
‘national Watson committee. Inthe
past, anywhere from one to three
Davidson students has been cho-
sen.

The fellowships are generally
characterized as being a bit off-
beat. Students propose very spe-
cific areas of study, and often
choose to travel to developing
countries. German Professor
Hansford Epes, a long standing
member of the nominating com-
mittee, says that the proposals usu-
ally contain “‘a sense of the imagi-
native, and are a little bit off the

to

Newcomb

wall.”
Sara Carlson is heading up
Davidson’s Watson nomination
process and is currently a news
intern on campus. She was a
Watson Fellow herself after her
graduation in 1993; she studied
native pony breeds of the North
Atlantic, David Tweedie ’94 is
currently studying the roots of
Appala-
chian
fiddle mu-
sic’ in
Canada,
Ireland,

Dean

Raney ’89
compared the approaches to sexual
assault in Francofile countries.

The Candidates
Epes says that the committee
nominates candidates “who we
think can win. We look for people
who interview well and have a
proposal that grows from what they

have done in the past and will |

contribute to what they do in the
future.” The fellowship is not
merit-based like the Fullbright or
Marshall scholarships. Epes calls
the fellowship “more freewheel-
ing and unique.”

Each of the four candidates
has a proposal distinctive to their
own personality. From ancient
mysticism to faith in the stars, these
students have interests that are com-
pletely original.

Rachel Newcomb

After spending a semester in
Morocco, Rachel Newcomb knew
that she wanted to go back. “All
the rumors that you hear about it
are untrue,” she Says. “It really isa
wonderful place.”

_InspiredbyProfessorJonathan

Berkey’ s Islamic Civilizationclass,
Newcomb wants to study a special
Islamic mysticism in the Middle
East called “sufism.” She would
travel to Morocco, India, Egypt,

and Senegal.

Sufi communities proliferate
the Islamic world, and she wants to
travel to many of them. “Sufism is
an offshoot of Islam that stresses a
deep love for and personal com-
munion with God. I want to see if
it is being threatened with present
day fundamentalism and secular-
ization.”

A
History
major
from
Rock Hill,
South
Carolina,
Newcomb
is excited
about the
proposal.
She also wants to study mystical
poetry there. “The sufis have a lot
of poetry, and writing is my favor-
ite thing to do.” :

Phoebe Dean

Last spring Phoebe Dean’s
father traveled to South Africa and
met a fascinating older man. This
man is the “longest banned person
in South Africa,” and he was look-
ing for a biographer. When con-
sidering what she wanted to do
next year, Dean decided that she
could do the job.

The man, affiliated with the
African National: Congress, has
been banned from all political life
in South Africa. “Basically, I
would do the biography as a win-
dow to studying the world of South
African politics.” She would base
her study in Durban, in the state of
Natal, but would travel to
Capetown and Johannesburg as
well. Dean, an English major from
New Smyrna Beach, Florida, also
sees this as a chance to learn more
about the writing process.
___Milica Tomasevic

A French major from Yugo-
slavia, Milica Tomasevic has al-
ways been fascinated with fate and
how people look for the answers.

Tomasevic spent last year in

Tomasevic

Scholarship

France, and there she found that
many people put their faith in as-
trology. Talking with her friends
in her war-ravaged home country,
“she found that many of them were
looking to the stars as well.

Her interest was thus peaked,
and she is proposing to travel to
France, England, Argentina, and
Columbia to study “how and why
astrology
is becom-
ing a sur-
rogate for
more con-
ventional
forms of
religion.”

Polster

Tomasevic
wants to
discover to what extent people al-
ter their actions to follow the stars
and whether their following is due
to environmental factors such as
race, education, or region. .
Charlie Polster

Charlie Polster is a man of
many interests. He is majoring in
International Medicine through the
Center for Interdisciplinary Stud-
ies and plans to get his masters
degree in International Studies and
eventually go into international hu-
manitarian trade in Russia.

Incorporating all of his diverse
studies into one, Polster is propos-
ing to study the folk medicine of
the Endogenous tribes of Northern
Siberia and the Far East.

The candidates’ final propos-
als are due Tuesday,.and the nomi-
nees will be interviewed in De-
cember. The winners will be noti-
fied in March.

Carlson supports the program
with enthusiasm. “Watson Fellows
have always been very successful
in doing their projects — not al-
ways in what they originally in-
tended to do, but in learning some-
thing about themselves.”

Dean says, “I think that the
people applying are wonderful. I
hope that we all get it.”
