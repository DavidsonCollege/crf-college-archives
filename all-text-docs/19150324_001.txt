Glee Club Gives
Star Performance

Musical Aggregation of Queens
College a Grand Success.

It was Queens College night at Dav-
idson Monday night. “Vhe occasion was
the concert by the Glee Club from. the
former college, under the direction of
Mrs. Coral Havner Baker.

To say that the concert was a great
success and that the numbers were per-
fectly lovely is merely to quote a part of
the milder tvpe of commendation evoked
from the college students as hosts. ‘This
verbal praise was affirmed and reaffirm-
ed by the insistent and well-nigh contin-
uous demands for encores, to which the
fair musicians responded most. gener-
ously.

But twenty-four of the torty members
of the club were present, and these sany
in perfect harmony a program replete
with musical numbers which, although
not of the heavy opera class. were of the
type most appreciated by the students.
and also one in which the singers excell
ed. Mrs. Baker is to be congratulated
upon the excellent training shown hs

the entire club.

Among the many excellent numbers
on the program so enthusiastically re-
ceived were “No Loafing.” a tale of the

deplorable condition at Queens‘ Vhe
Man and the Maiden.” a story of the
lovelorn Davidson student who choked

both of wham showed a_ remarkable
mastery of the technique of these mstru
ments.

On the whole the entire concert was
one of the most enjovable events of the
season to the Davidsonians. and it is
honed to make this visit from our sister
college an anual affair.

At the close of the concert an infor-
mal reception was held in the Library
building by the Athletic Association in
honor of the fair visitors.

THE NEW CATALOGUE.

The new Devidsan College catalog
was mailed to all the students last week.
and it shows a considerable improvement
over the last catalogue issued. The most
noticeable change is the black cover in-
stead of the white cover. as has hereto-
fore been used. Tt is nicely bound and
as a whole presents a very neat appear-
ance. The students and friends of the
college will be glad to note that the
states and countries represented at Dav-
idson this year cover a_ wider range
than in nrevious vears. Thus the fame
ef our college spreads.

ISplendid Services

During the Week

Dr. Graham Brings Forceful Mes-
sage to People of City.

Dr. Graham has just finished a series
of very. successtul services, “Phe at
tendance throughout the week has been
very good and evervone has manifested
a spirit of true earnestness and desire tor
spiritual help.

Vhe services were impressive and
spiritual cfrom = the first, showing the
carnestness and power of Dr. Graham.
His first sermon was rather an introduc:

tory one, In this sermon he brought
out the Jove ot Christ tor the world.
In his) second sermon) Dr. Graham

brought to his andience the command oft
Christ to the world, “Love ve one an
other.” “Phe sermons that followed
were hased on the great truth that
Christ can reach a man in any condition
or in anv walk of life with His saving
power. “The speaker held up before his

audience trom time to time with splendid |

eloquence the patient waiting, of Christ.

“Tuesday evening Dr. Graham's: text
was: “Jesus behalding him, loved hit.”
He spoke of the three persons or groups
at persons whoo it is said that Christ
leved—the voung ruler. John the dis
ciple, and Litvarus with his two: sisters.
He remarked that the rich young rulet
has often) been misjudged by commen
tators, that they offen see nothing lov
able in’ this character. Dr. Graham
brought aut clearly same of the lovable
qualities af this voung man, He was
young. and evervone admires and loves

and pure, and sincerely declared that he
had kept all the commandinents, “The

Thursday evening Dr. Grahans
bronght a message from Luke toss. De

Saturday evenmny Ur. Coraham con

see a thing before he was convinced. He
spoke of him as a man who when he

“My Lord and my Ged.” Last of all
he contrasted with these two the timid

that he was a disciple of Christ. but

meetings. At 9:45 a. m. Dr. Graham
addressed the students at the church.

Owing to the cancellation of three im-

portant gsanes in the last few days by
one at the most prominent collepes in
North Carolina, the schedule has) been
late in coming out, but atter all it ap-
perrs that the Varsity has a hard road
betore them. An improvement: ine the
schedule is that all) small games have
been dropped and representative colleges
of Virginia, North Carolina, and South
Carolina have been taken on, Manager
Shaw has had ahard dine carranging the
vames this vear, and thanks are due to
hing tor handling: the matter ax well its
he did. even though be had so many
games cancelled by colleges that he had
counted on plaving.

The faculiy allows the Varsity. ten
tall davs off the PLU, and every one of
them has been taken up. “Lhe first game
off the Hill is with Wofford, at Rock
Hill, S. Cu. on April 5; chen the Une
versity of North Carolina brings its
strong aggregation to the Hill on. the
oth. A week's -trip through South Caro
lina starts the rath, against’ Wofford,
Furman, Presbyterian College of S.C.,
and two gates with the University of
South Carolina.

The diamond prospects of the Varsity
this year bid fair, although little has
been said regardings its however we all
know “BIN Fetzer is a man of actions
and not words; incidentally he is con-
sidered one of the best base ball coaches
in this section of the country, and it can
be relied on that semething in the form
af a good base ball team will be forth
coming when the season opens next Fri-
day with the worthy bunch from Elon:

The base ball squad has been rapidly
rounding into” shape during the pre-
season weeks, and if the weather keeps
up. should be in good form for its first
games. “The squad is given a hard work:
out everys afternoon, and vencrally a
three ar four inning contest between the
Varsity and Scrubs finishes the after-
noon’s work.

The pitchers, under the — efficient
coaching of Coach Fetzer, are showing
good form. Among the most promising
of these fingers are Groom, Lawson and
Hengeveldt.. On these three will prob-
ably fall the bulk of Davidson's mound
work. They are all hard workers and
have improved wonderfully in the fine
points of pitching. With the help of
Coach Fetzer in the practice games, and
the games with the “All-Stars” and
Huntersville, each one showed that he
