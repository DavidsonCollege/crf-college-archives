THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 24, 1935

SERIAL PROVIDES
CAMPUS THRILLS

Davidson college students are in for @
grand treat—a new Serial.

Every Saturday for the next eleven
weeks, if they are forced to hang around
the old school for that long, they can
live for a short, breath-taking thirty
minutes in “The Lost City,” a hidden
power plant nestling in the wilds of
South Africa, which is running at the
Davidson movie house.

Wild beasts, gruesome black giants,
vivid electrical storms, native tribes, be-
whiskered white traders, gigantic power
units, deformed specimen of mankind,
mighty laboratories, a brave American,
a beautiful girl in trouble, and a power-
ful master-mind of the underworld are
all scrambled into this exciting melo-
drama.

In the opening chapter, a human mon-
ster has assembled a great power unit
in the heart of unexplored Africa with
which, by charging the atmosphere,. he
plans to destroy the world. Our hero,
locating his hidden city. with his new
detector, starts with an expedition to
wipe him from the earth.

Meanwhile, the snake has forced an
old inventor to fashion for him an en-
larging machine, with which he molds
captured natives into weird black giants.

The American expedition pushes to-
ward the Lost City. The blackard dis-
covers them, and lays a perfect ambush.

High-Grade Freshmen
ften Finish Lower

(Associated Collegiate Press)

Freshmen, who get off to a flying start
in their studies, tend to slack off during
the rest of their undergraduate years,
and fail to make Phi Beta Kappa, the
goal af of all studiously-inclined under-
graduates, a study made by “The Michi-
gan Daily,” University of Michigan
paper, proves,

In the graduating class of 1931, out of
49 Phi Beta Kappas, only twenty had
made first year honorary societies, and
in the 1932 graduates, 26 out of 53 Phi
Betes had been honored in their fresh-
man‘ year. In 1933 and 1934, 16 and 17,
respectively, finished as they had started,
out of a total of 46 and 36 for the two
respective years who were awarded
Senior keys of scholarship.

Records of Phi Beta Kappa show that,
since 1924, 46 per cent of its membership
are women. During the same period,
women have constituted approximately
one-third of the total university enroll-
ment, giving one-third of the student
body almost one-half of the honors.

Federal Aid Research
Said To Be Impending

(Associated Collegiate Press)

Proposing a two-year emergency fund
of $50,000,000 to be set aside by the fed-
eral government to provide temporary
compensation in fellowships to outstand-
ing college graduates, Anton J. Carlson,
professor at the University of Chicago,
emphasized the need for a practical pol-
icy of extending federal financed re-
search in America, in a speech here re-
cently.

“A corps of scientific investigators en-
gaged in research would enable any first
class institution with a graduate school
to do society a great deal of good,”
Prof. Carlson declared.

Speaking before a group of graduate
and undergraduate research students in
the physical’ “and biological sciences
which has petitioned the federal govern-
ment for employment at wage levels
sufficient for their full support, Prof.
Carlson told them that “the government
doesn’t owe you a living. You will have
to take what you can get, along with
the man in the street.”

John Lee, President
Of Sigma Delta Psi

John Lee, of Barium Springs, was
elected president for next year to suc-
ceed: Fritz Byerly, Gréensboro, last week
at a meeting of Sigma Delta Psi, national
honorary fraternity.

To qualify for membership in this
fraternity a man must be a good all
around athlete and must fill certain re-
quirements in a large number of athletic
activities.

College Abandons
Old Grade System

(Associated Collegiate Press)
Doing. away with the alphabetical sys-
tem of grading, professors and instruc-
tors at Russell Sage College for Women
(Troy, N. Y.) gave out their first marks
here recently under a new system which
either: passes, fails or conditions the stu-
dents.

The new plan is a part of the pro-
gram to put more responsibility on the
student. As a substitute for the usual
A, B C, system of grading, monthly
conferences between the student and her
instructors have been held. These con-
ferences reveal the weaknesses of the
student’s work more directly than marks,
help to develop -the power of the» stu-
dent to evaluate her own work and as-
sist her in forming effective study habits,
J. L. Meader, president of the college,
pointed out.

By means of a key number system,
which assigns a number to each student,
the administration maintains a list of the
standings of each class. Students de-
siring to know wher€®they stand in re-
lation to their classmates are given their
own number.

SPECIAL DEGREE FOR
HONOR WORK AT PENN

Students. at the University of Penn-
sylvania who achieve exceptional recog-
nition in a particular field will be given
a special degree as a result of action
taken by the university trustees follow-
ing a recommendation by the college fac-
ulty.

According to Dr. Paul H. Musser,
dean of the college, the faculty recom-
mended the plan in the belief that it
would prove of exceptional value to
those who contemplated graduate study
or research work.

While working for the new degree,
students will be able to specialize to a
limited extent during their undergradu-
ate years and at the same time there
will be no change in the general broad
program of cultural education to which
the college is committed.

Under the direction of Gordon Bar-

put in effect, with the result that 66 per
cent of the students this year, earned bet-
ter than a C average, while last year
only 45 per cent attained this rating.

ALUMNUS NOW AT PRINCETON

W. O. Puckett, of the class of ’27, has
just been appointed assistant professor
of zoology at Princeton University.

While a student at Davidson, Puckett
majored in biology and served as assist-
ant in that subject.. The year following
his graduation he was awarded a fel-
lowship at the University of North Car-
olina, where he also served as assist-
ant in the department. Later he won a
fellowship at Princeton University,
which institution conferred upon him the
degree of Ph.D, in January, 1934. He is
at present on the faculty of Southwest-
ern at Memphis, Tennessee, but will take
up his new duties at Princeton in the

fall.

gratulated them upon theit choice of
Henry Cathey as next year’s president.
Cathey also thanked the students for
their codperation.

K. D,. Weeks, former editor of The
Davidsonian, conducted Lamont Brown
to the platform, after Cathey’s installa-
tion, and addressed the audience in be-
half of the weekly paper. He expressed
his appreciation to the students and to
the faculty for interest and codéperation.
He concluded by giving the motto of
The Davidsonian to Lamont Brown, in-
coming editor.

Bob ‘Smith, editor of the '35 annual,
after conducting the next year’s editor,
Martin Barnett, to the platform, thanked
the students for their response in hav-
ing individual pictures taken, the hon-
orary and social fraternities, and all
other organization for, their coéperation
and efforts in collecting material. He
then presented Martin Barnett with a]
of the '34 annual as a token of
the editorship, along with the “dirty
work” accompanying it. Barnett re-
sponded with a short appeal for the
same type of ready coéperation.

Lorenzo McPhail, outgaing editor of
the Yowl, installed the new editor of
the humor magazine, “Scotty” McLeod,
with a fluent address to the student body.

Finally, Fred McPhail, chairman and
outgoing president of the Senior class,
conducted Bob Lindsay to the stage and
presented him with the gavel, as repre-
sentative of that office. McPhail con-
gratulated the students on their choice,
and Lindsay responded with a desire for
unity and loyalty among all the classes
besides the Senior class.

The installation ceremonies were con-
cuded with the singing of the college

song, “O Davidson.”

Retiring President

equilibrium and _ his popularity waxed
rather than waned, and the ovation
which followed his farewell address

Monday is indicative of the esteem in
which he is held today.

Elected almost by acclamation to the
presidency of the student body, he im-
mediately exhibited in this office those
qualities of leadership which had been
so apparent in his other efforts. From
the first, his handling of the judicial
affairs of the student body through the
student council showed his innate ability
as a jurist and promised for him a bril-
liant career in his chosen profession. His
convictions, once determined, were not
swayed by opposition or desire for appro-
bation. His democracy was unquestioned,
and in all of his activities as head of the
council his sense of justice was evident.

So complete was the confidence of the
student body in their president that he
was able to counsel it and direct its
thotight along sane lines, in spite of ap-
parently insurmountable difficulties. There
were occasions during the year when the
student body needed criticism, and at
these times Brown never hesitated to
point out its shortcomings. Instead of
producing adverse reaction, this criticism
brought applause even from those who
were the object of the censure.

In addition to his work student
body president, Brown was one of the
leading scholars in his class, was the best
debater Davidson has had for many
years, was a successful and constructive
president for O, D. K. leadership fra-
ternity, and served as head of his social
fraternity, Beta Theta Pi.

For campus

several years sentime’
favor of a ck in the
social system at Davidson, but nothing
co oH afong this line had been
done. Inspired by the force of Brown's
leadership, seventy-five per cent of the
upperclassmen formed themselves into a
unified group to promote the moving of
Davidson dances to the campus. Under
his direction a conservative yet effective
agitation has been carried on to bring

Mr. Angel was born in Winston-Sa
lem, where he developed his vocal tal-
ents. ‘In 1931 he won the five thousand
dollar prize in the annual Atwater Kent
Audition Concert. For. the past two years
Mr. Angel has been studying in New
York and appearing in Broadway pro-
ductions in his spare time.

The former concerts have featured
such well-known programs as: Palmer
Christian, organist; Joseph Brinkman,
pianist; Michigan Little Symphony Or
chestra, under the direction of Thor
Johnson.

about this-result. His handling of the
situation brought high commendation
even from those who were strongly op-
posed to the movement.

His ability is recognized and appre-
ciated not only on the campus but also
among the alumni, trustees, and the out-
side world in general. Following his pre
sentation of the petition to the trustees
in February, one member of the board
asked him to come to his church to
preach. His speaking ability has brought
many invitations to make addresses in
cities in the surrounding territory. Fol-
lowing a talk made before the alumni
chapter in Greenville, S. C., an alumnus
asked to be introduced to Brown, saying
that he would like to shake hands with
the man who was some day going to
be president of the United States.

In the opinion of many, this man from
Hackensack, New Jersey, is the best stu-
dent y president that Davidson has
ever had. Nlis success at Davidson gives
promise of \an even greater career at
the Harvard\Law school and in after
life.

This editoria\bespeaks in a small way
the gratitude and\devotion of his fellow
students and other friends, and assures
him that Davidson will always have a
