Dogwood, Driftwood, Deadwood

It’s almost time for President Dee
Green to plant his dogwoods, and we
want to wish him the best of luck
with them. In case some don’t re-
member, dogwood is the kind of stu-
dent government we're going to have,
not driftwood or deadwood.

Some people around here don't
give the dogwood much of a chance
to live, especially the Student Coun-
cil dogwood which up until now has
thrived. Some think that the Honor
Court dogwood will contribute to its
decay.

There has been much discussion
lately concerning the status and rela-
tionship of the two. Many contend
that in a few years the Council will be
an honorary body with no vital func-
tions.

President Green told the DAVID-
SONIAN several weeks ago that he
hoped the two would be “separate
and equal” bodies. Because of their
different memberships we assume
that they will function as separate
bodies. We are not so sure, however,
that they will flourish equally over
the years.

_ Of course, it’s our hope that the
Court is the honorary body. If they
never had to try a case everyone
would be happy. But in case they do
their functions are clearly outlined.

The Council, from our viewpoint,
is in more danger of dying from lack
of nourishment. President Dee is go-
ing to have to lead in the search for
things to do. He’s going to have to
find plant food that will appeal not
only to the Council, but to the en-
tire student body.

He will not find this mass appeal
in membership in national organiza-
tions such as the National Student As-

sociation, nor other such far removed
projects. The Student Council is go-
ing to have to concern itself with af-
fairs which concern the average stu-
dent.

The major problem is one of try-
ing to bridge the gaps between stu-
dents, faculty and administration. But
even the search for answers and so-
lutions to this rather abstract prob-
lem can become bogged down and
sink from the student’s sight.

In order to reassure a budding
Council, President Dee is going to
have to initiate action to relieve basic,
on-the-surface student problems.

The drinking question has never
been adequately answered. A step in
this direction would evoke much stu-
dent interest and appreciation. There
is still the matter of campus theft
which must be eliminated. Although
they have been greatly improved this
year, campus elections still reek of
apathy and indifference on basic is-
sues.

Another problem: which will be-
come more apparent next year is that
of adequate student parking facilities.
Cooperation in solving such problems
of student convenience will be more
popular than all the resolutions and
recommendations passed in recent
years.

What it all amounts to is this: the
Council is going to have to come down
to the student level. It is going to
have to show results we can see
around us, not merely on paper.

The Council is going to have to
roll up its sleeves and work hard to
make that dogwood flourish, but if
it chooses this course of action, by
next spring we may see some real
blossoms.

MemoToFaculty:
It's Spring

The incapacitation of John Foster
Dulles, the impending resignation of
Konrad Adenauer are the signs of
history. The. day of the unbending,
resolute old man is setting.

The day of the little man has sure-
ly come. It came when David Niven,
and not John Wayne, won the Acade-
my Award. Q

Faculty members would do well
to heed the signs. Ease up.-
R.E.L.

You're Invited...

We are sure that one of Presi-
dent Martin’s warmest memories is
that of the student body, gathered en
masse, as he emerged from Cham-
bers Building last Spring as the
school’s new president.

It was a rather unexpected icing
for what must have been for him
a very thrilling day.

We think that it would be a shame
if an even larger and more enthusi-
astic student contingent did not at-
tend his Inauguration on April 22.

The faculty obviously did not sus-
pend classes on that day to expedite
a mass exodus of students in madras
shorts and straw hats (an idea which
under other circumstances has great
merit.)

Elaborate plans have been made
for the big day. Over two hundred-
fifty schools will be represented.

This is our chance to show these
schools how proud we are of our new
President.

It is our chance to pay a much de-
served tribute to a man who has be-
come an integral part of student life,
rather than divorcing himself from
it.

End Of An Era

The cry of absentee ownership is
harsh in the South. We observe with
regret the economic pressures that
are forcing consolidation of the small
newspapers of a city to alien inter-
ests,

The latest victim of this trend is
the Charlotte News. Its sale ends
the independent history of one of our
section’s most respected journals.

The strength of a paper lies partly
in its total involvement in the local
situation. The Charlotte News demon-
slrated this, and served also as the
school of many able journalists,
among which W. J. Cash, Harry Ash-

more, and Burke Davis.

It is fortunate that the Knight or-
ganization absorbed the News. It has
demonstrated a desire to emphasize
quality at every level in the Charlotte

Observer.

CHANGE BRINGS CHALLENGE

Council Now Able To Venture
Into New Areas, Says Green

As the Student Council of
1959-60 takes the reins of Da-
vidson College student govern-
ment, it is faced with a big
challenge which will offer it a
chance to venture into areas
which Student Councils in the
past have not had the oppor-
tunity to explore fully.

With the creation of the Hon-
or Court, the Council is re-
lieved of the very important
and time-consuming judicial
functions with which previous
Councils have been concerned.

COOPERATION NEEDED

I feel that we now have the
opportunity to work iaore close-
ly with the faculty and with the
student body as a whole to ef-
fect a greater cohesiveness be-

tween these two groups.

I think that my proposal to
have some of next year’s Coun-
cil meetings in the fraternity
houses will create an interest in
the student body that has here-
tofore been woefully lacking.

With the cooperation of the
fraternities I believe that both
the Council and the Davidson
student will be able to benefit
greatly from a closer personal
relationship. I also plan to try
to have several supper meet-
ings with interested members
of the faculty to create a clos-
er tie in this area.

BIG WORK AHEAD
We have a great many im-
portant issues to work on right

plementation of the Honor

cent elections changes, the
problem of the Court of Con-

trol, and the appointment of
cheerleaders for next year.

Next year’s Council is. faced
with a real challenge in trying
to match the high standard of
accomplishment- set by John
Kuykendall and his Council this
year.

With a full realization of the
responsibility with which we
are faced, we, the Student
Council of 1959-60, look forward
with both humility and antici-
pation to serving the Davidson
College student body next year.
With your help and suggestions
we look forward to a suecess-
ful and rewarding year.

Davidson's four contenders Nye studies fine arts and geo- time slot in the weekend tele-

tionwide television appearance
—are hard at work.

“We're all studying different
almanacs," said team captain
Bobby Livingston this week,
“plus reading Time magazine
and the Sunday New York
Times every week.”

In addition, the team mem-
bers individually have se-
lected informational fields
outside their major academic
ereas for intensive study be-
fore the quiz competition on
April 19.

Charles Chastain, senior
philosophy major, is training in
science.

He is under the tutelage of
Profes-or Gallent of the Chem-
istry Department.

He is also reviewing material
in history and current events.

Livingston, an Eaglish major,
has begun reading and study
with faculty members in psy-
chology and economics.

ker will cover “miscellaneous
knowledge,” emphasizing sports
and current events, while Frank

Bow! Quiz, in which Barnard
College’s champion all-girl

Qn German Crisis

By JOHN STONE

I don’t look for much changé at present in the Ger-
man situation brought about by Konrad Adenauer’s resig-
nation. The venerable Chancellor will be, in all prob-
ability, at the summit conference this summer. What this
means for later on— it’s too early to tell. The Christian
Democrats remain in control of the government until the
next elections in 1961.

Ludwig Erhard, Adenauer’s probable successor, is
believed to be a little more friendly toward the English
and perhaps a little less so toward the French. Adenauer
has been openly dedicated to the construction of modern
West Germany, and has been a staunch supporter of
Western policy; but then, so has Erhard.

ARTIFICIAL DIVISION

The situation in Germany is one of articifial division
of a composite ethnic group. This has created nothing
but international headache ever since-the straining of
East-West relations around 1948, and the end is not yet
in sight. Any hope for a real reunification of Germany
anytime soon is more than likely to be disappointed.

At present, the crisis centers around Berlin. Tensions
mounted after last November 27, but now appear to be
receding in the face of the planned summit conference.
The details of the crisis are well known; however, they
are not, in my opinion, the crux of the matter.

BERLIN: A PAWN

Berlin is one of the pawns in the game of power
politics being played by the members of the two power
blocs, represented by NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The
Russians have stated their case, and we, ours.

A conference has ‘been called, signaling a prestige
victory for the Communist bloc, who originally demanded
it. Whether that victory will be permanent depends upon
the outcome of this summer’s conference. Conferences
of this nature have been known to alter, or even re-
verse, decisions.

WAR OUTLOOK

I don’t look for a war over the Berlin question, at
least not immediately. At this time, neither side has any-
thing to gain or lose which is worth total war,

Meanwhile, keep your eye on the Middle East. De-
velopments there may come to a head at any time, and
the prize that goes to the winner is control of 63% of
the world’s total oil reserves.

the other day about writing a

Selma didn’t make the Col-

lot of constructive ideas on
how to give America a true
picture of the real Davidson
gentleman. Passing over such
obvious things as clothing, ap-
pearance and _ sophistication,
we'll slice right into the meat
of the matter and examine
some intangibles that a casual
visitor to the college would no-
tice.

First, panel, exchange little
pleasantries with everyone.
When introduced, smile and
say “Hit” Davidson is a friend-
ly place. Defer to the other
panelists with a coy smile and
a standard “No, you go ahead.”

Refer constently to your
Davidson background; after
all, your two years of gen-
eral education give you an
obvious advantage in answ-
ering superficial questions.

the student body's thought,

lacking hindsight because of
the inability to turn around,
and lacking foresight because
of someone’s immediate pos-
terior. Being accustomed to
Davidson's atmosphere of
