, Steere Classifies Man

: “I was collected,” said Dr.
Douglas V. Steere, quoting Au-
' gustine in chapel Tuesday. And
1 men are of two kinds, collected
+ and uncollected, he maintained.
_ Professor emeritus at Haver-
i' ford College, Steere said the col.
|}lected man has “‘no time for
‘| considering, no time for leisurely
‘| reading.”

“God often has to do over
again, to unsnarl, what we rush
through,’ he said in describing
the uncollected man.

On the other hand, the col-
lected man is marked by ‘‘all-
thereness."’ He doesn’t drive with
\|the brakes on,"’ said Steere.

“Firm at the center, he is free
at the periphery,’’ due to confi-
dence in something underneath,
claimed Steere.

Following chapel, Steere an-
‘|}swered questions about his
speech and other topics.

A self-avowed  ‘‘existential
‘| realist,” Steere is a member of
the Society of Friends. ‘‘Exis-
tentialists almost never have an
Z| adequate philosophy of nature
. . . but realism brings them
back.”’ Steere said.

Three Experts To Show
Techniques Of Karate

Davidson students will get to
see three karate experts demon.
strate their specialty in Mon-
day's assembly as part of the
Intramural Athletic Council's
Expert Series.

Coming to Davidson will be
Jhoon Rhee, one of the leading
authorities of karate in the
United States: Pat Burleson, a
member of the athletic staff of
the University of Mississippi
specializing in karate; and Julius
Griffith, a student of Burleson’s
who is planning to open karate
classes in Charlotte and is ex-
ploring the possibility of con-
ducting classes here.

The type of karate they will but it will give you an advantage
demonstrate .is Tae Kwon Do, in that it will give you a pride in

which means ‘foot and hand”
karate. Griffith explained that
the basic style of Tae Kwon Do
is a kick style.

“Karate is 90 per cent mental
and 10 per cent physical.” he
said. ‘Most beginners are un-
able to notice their mental de.
velopmext at first. But the pur-
pose of the sport is to develop
self-discipline. It promotes exer-
cise through the use of all of the
muscles similar to swimming. It
will not make anyone big and
strong.

“Tt won't make you invincible,

your body,”’ he said.

Following the assembly, Grif-
fith is planning to discuss the
possibilities at a coffee hour of
setting up a karate club on
campus which would function

‘just as other clubs on campus.

He would instruct the members
in the fundamentals of the sport.
The tentative price per month
would be $20, Griffith said.

The club would be associated
with the Jhoon Rhee Institute of
Tae Kwon Do, Inc.. which
teaches classes for congressmen
at the Pentagon in Washington,

‘Dc.

Following the. Monday sched.

Steere characterized uncol-
lectedness on a personal level.
“Living the dispersed lives that
we live, our apertures seem to

“get closed .. . like a 16 setting on

a camera instead of a two.”

He cited examples of ‘‘open-
ness,‘' such ‘as taking time to
enjoy the beauty of a sunset.

When asked if higher educa-
tion encouraged or discouraged
openness, Steere answered, “I

think it’s doing both, but more
hindering than helping.”

He said that he used to see
boys in the stacks of the Haver.
ford library lying on their backs,
absorbed in a book. He added
that this was no longer a com-
mon sight, yet he hesitated to
ascribe its disappearance to lack
of time.
