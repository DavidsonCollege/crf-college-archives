vidson Athletics quickly moving up

By HAP BRYANT

Davidson athletics has, made
major strides in recent years, suc-
cess that should continue into the
future, according to Athletic Di-
rector Kit Morris. Merris views
athletic achievement as a vital part
of the college, a philosophy which
he hopes to convey to students and
other Wildcat supporters. -

Morris believes that sports
such as baseball, soccer, men’s
and women’s tennis, and basket-
ball have improved greatly, which
he attributes to excellent coaching
and the intensity of student-
athletes. He looks. optimistically
upon the future of Davidson foot-
ball as well.

According to Morris, David-

“son’s goal for its football program
is ‘to be competitive in the Colo-
nial League.” Another, seemingly
more distant, goal is winning a
conference championship in foot-
ball. He expressed the belief that
the current football coaching staff
has directed its efforts in the right
direction. “Given our recent his-
tory, I fell confident that we are on
target.” However, two or three
years will have to pass before the
effects of Coach Vic Gatto’s ef-
forts will result in a winning status
for football. According to Morris,
recruiting efforts during the two
years prior to Gatto’s hiring were
less than adequate. Thus, David-
son must now compete with two
solid recruiting classes against
teams with four solid recruiting
classes. Morris stressed that “‘re-
building a program is not 4 simple

thing.”
’ As a member of the Colonial

League, Davidson will enter a
conference with which it has had
limited experience. As Morris
said, “Competitively, there are
questions that we can’t resolve
until we get into next season.”

_However, he believes that the

schedule will benefit the program.
“I feel good about the schedule
we'll be playing.” Membership in
the Colonial League will allow
Davidson to schedule both Colo-
nial League members and Ivy
League members. With those op-
ponents and two more good re-
cruiting years, Morris said, “It is
my sense that we can build here a
resonably competitive program.
We’re not out of the woods yet,
but we can begin to make some
competitive headway.”

In other sports, Morris praised
the efforts of the coaching staffs.
He particularly recognized the

. women’s tennis team, which has

made a smooth transition to Divi-
sion I competition. The program
is still in the process of bettering
its schedule, but Morris feels con-
fident that success will continue.
In recent matches, Morris sees
great developments.. “The victory
over UTC may represent the
biggest victory to date of any of

our women’s teams against Divi-
sion 1 competition.”

In--basketball, which Morris .

called Davidson’s “showcase
sport,” he is “delighted with re-
sults that Coach Hussey and his
teams have accomplished over the
past two seasons.” Although af-
filiation with the Southern Con-
ference will end after next year,
Morris believes that success and

competition will continue. He
looks toward the Colonial Athletic
Association as the most viable fu-
ture conference for Davidson.
The Colonial Athletic Associ-
ation, formed in 1985 from the
ECAC §$outh Conference, con-
sists of American University, East
‘Carolina, George Mason, James
Madison, Navy, Richmond,

UNC-WIlmington, and William .

and Mary. The conference spon-
‘sors DIvision I sports in all sports '
except football and requires mem-
ber participation in all sports.
According to Morris, he,
President Kuykendall, and the
Board of Trustees continue to
work behind the scenes, trying to
gain entrance into the Colonial
He describes the
conference plight as “a challeng-
ing situation,” as “the conference

‘that we would like to join at the

present time is not actively seek-
ing new members. We have re-
sponsibility for cultivating their
interest in us.” Although the con-
ference appears closed, Morris

- stressed that he still has work to

do. “We-want to improve our
quality and put ourselves in a posi-
tion to take advantage of any op-
portunity that may come available
in the near future.”

Regarding the exit from the
Southern Conference, Morris
noted that his options were lim-
ited. The other member schools of
the Southern Conference revoked
the waiver that allowed Davidson
to compete in conference sports
while not competing for the con-
ference championship in football.

Athletic Director Christopher B.

The Trustees’ decison in the early
1970’s to end football scholar-

~ships forced Morris to move to-
ward ‘a conference Whose mem- .

bers also grant only need-based
scholarships. Morris feels the
Colonial League is the answer. He
noted, “Do you take the sport that
involves more students and is
most expensive and forfeit our
competitive stature, our self-es-
teem, and resources we devote for
the single reason of maintaining

our relation with the Southern
Conference?”

Morris feels the conference
move was the right one, and he
looks confidently on the future of

- not only Davidson football and

basketball, but of other sports as
well. As he said, “There are some
good things happening,” and he
looks for further advances in the
coming years. :

Women’s tennis ends season in strong fashion

By ANDY BARRON

The women’s tennis team got
red-hot last weekend as they out-
played Southern Conference ri-
vals Marshall and Tennessee-
Chattanooga, 9-0 and 6-3 respec-
tively, and then beat denomina-
tional rival Presbyterian 7-2.

The three-match tear left the
Wildcats 9-5 on the season.

Last Saturday the Wildcats got
more competition from the wea-

ther and their wakeup call than.

Marshall. The 6 a.m. wake-up
call, seven hour van ride and blus-
tery 30 degree weather failed to
slow Davidson’s charge at shut-
ting out the Thundering Herd.
Davidson’s relentlessness in-
spired peace offerings from Mar-

She expects to play in today’s
match at Appalachian State.

Sophomore Angela Rudert,
Davidson’s number seven player,
displayed Davidson’s depth by
taking McNeilis’ place against
Marshall and tearing through her
opponent 6-2,6-1. ;

The next day, davidson bat-
tled daylight savings time and the
second ranked, three-time confer-
ence champion Tennessee-Chat-
tanooga squad. As Davidson was
ranked third in the conference,
this match held a lot of importance
in determining the seeds for the

upcoming conference tourna-
ment.
Senior captain Debbie Podolin

was the first off the courts with a

all’ and Presbyterian In the other singles matches,
matches with a hamstring injury. sophomore Jane Price won easily

at number six, 6-2, 6-1 while
sophomore Alice Stubbs lost a
tough setter at number five, 7-6,
6-7, 6-0.

With the overall match al-
ready decided, Davidson began
their less domineering doubles.
The number two doubles team of
Stone and Stubbs were David-
son’s only victors. Nonetheless,
the upset victory pushed Davidson
up in the conference standings.

Davidson again needed only
the singles matches in beating Pre-
sbyterian. The Wildcats
sandwiched straight set wins by
Podolin (6-0, 6-1), Stubbs (6-2, 6-
2) and Price (6-1, 6-0) between
two gutty comebacks by Stone (1-
6, 6-2, 6-2) and sophomore
Martha Johnson (4-6, 6-1, 7-5) to
secure the match. Add Davidson’s
two doubles wins and you get an
easy 7-1 win.

_ The winning continued last

Coach Caroline Brown feels
the recent winning streak has

Davidson peaking just in time for
the conference tournament.

“The. Davidson women’s ten-
nis team is poised to make a run at

the title,” Brown ‘said. “We’ve
gained momentum and I feel very
optimistic about winning the con-
ference.”

Less than stellar play around
the greens caused the golf team to
perform worse than expected in
recent tournaments. April 2 and 3
at Winthrop College in Rock Hill,
the Wildcats placed ninth of fif-
teen teams in a weak field. Bad
weather. conditions hampered
play, and all scores were high.
The medalist for the Cats was
Craig Carlock, with Gates
Grainger and Sean O’Neil close
behind. es
