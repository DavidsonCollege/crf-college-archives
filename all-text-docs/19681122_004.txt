Driesell ‘Worries’
As Season Nears

Every one of Davidson's
starters received some type
of post-season conference
award last vear. and all five
return: But - Coach Lefty
Driesell still worries:

He worries about overcon
fidence. about playing toge-
ther and about early ‘peak
ing.’ Worrying is part of his
job. But the tougher sched-
ule and increasing confer.
ence competition makes it a
bit stiffer. and a bit more
necessary:

Overconfidencé is a prob.
Jem which Drieseli hopes the
team can shake.

“They're good.” he said
this week. ‘and they know
they're good. but they can’t
play 50 percent and expect
to win because . they are

good."

A couple of taxing scrim
mages this fall have worn
through some of the barriers
of overconfidencé. Driesell
says. and he. hopes the rest
disappear before the .’Cats
open next Saturday with
VMI,

Another problem Driesell
hepes to conquer is getting
the team to play together.

“We aren't big enough to
physically overpower any-
one," he said. *‘so we are
going to have to win on
hustle and team effort. We
need to play together.”

By playing together,. Drie-
sell refers largely. to defense:
and board control. He isn’t
overly-concerned with the of.
fense.

“Every one of our starters
can score when he has to,”
Driesell said. “‘We have the
scoring ability. but we have
to hustle on defense to make
up-for our lack of height."

Except for sophomore
guard Ron Stelzer. the team
is in good physical shape:
Stelzer is returnng to prac-
tice now after an ankle in-
jury kept him out of practice
for three weeks.

But Driesell emphasizes
that he doesn't want the team
to reach its physical or men-
tal peak yet. He doesn’t
want that to happen until

AYO’s Display
Bench Strength

One of the strengths of
Wildcat basketball is the
power of the bench team, of
the AYO’s ‘(all you others).

”" Indeed, the power of the
bench has led one conference
sportswriter to labet the
Davidson skins as “the sec-
ond best team in the South-
ern Conference, next to the
first team.”'

Coach Lefty Driesell has
considerable talent from
which he can draw replace.
ments.

After the top seven spots,
including the starters plus
O'Neill and Kirley, there are
eight competitors for sub-
stitute roles. The same
sportswriter noted that those
eight would probably start at
other conference schools.

Sophomore Ricky Snipes is
big and will be used in re-
lief under the boards. He
needs to be a bit tougher.

Sophomore guards Ron
Stelzer and Billy Pierce will
be used sparingly. with the
main relief for playmaker
Dave Moser coming from
another sophomore, Duzcan
Postma. Postma was im-
pressive in the recent scrim
mage with Tennessee.

Senior Rocky Crosswhite
has been impressive during
practice scrimmages, lead.
ing scorers in the team’s
open scrimmage in Charlotte.

Junior Jan Postma has
an accurate shot and will
play in a top relief role.

Fox DeMoisey, a junior.
and seniofs Mike Spann and
Tony Orsbon will see limit-
ed action this year. with
DeMoisey sharing Moser's
relief with Postma.

tournament time at the end
of the season.

“That is not to say that
we won't be up for Vander-
bilt or VMI or Furman,"
Driesell said. ‘‘We'll be way
up for them, but I don’t want
to reach the peak until
March.”’

Driesell said that the num.
ber of home games this year
will not make any noticeable
difference in team attitude.
“A good team can win any-
where,’ he said, ‘and we
play a number of good teams
in Charlotte.”

Driesell does a good bit of
worrying. but he speaks of
this year’s chances with a
smile. “With a bit of good
luck,’ he said, “we can go
a long way.”

Opponents: The Hard Way

Coach Lefty Driesell calls
this year's schedule ‘‘the
toughest it’s ever been."’ The
team plays a total .of 19
different opponents, includ-
ing four 20-game winners
from last season.

The teams making up the
list of opponents represent
eight different athletic con-
ferences, including Atlantic
Coast, Big Ten, Ivy, Mid-
Atlantic, Southeastern, South-
west, Missouri Valley and the
Southern.

The four teams’ which
achieved the 20.win mark
last season are Dayton, Duke,
Princeton. and Vanderbilt.
With their records included.
opponents for this year com.
piled a win-loss record last
year of 235-165.

The teams that make up
the “toughest”? schedule are:
THE CITADEL
Coach Dick Campbell will
welcome back three starters
this year from the squad
which compiled an 11-14 re-

cord last season.

Leading the returnees are
senior cocaptains Al Kro.

O’Neill Assumes
‘Best Sub’ Role

The Davidson prognosis in
the Southern Conference
handbook refers to senior
Mike O'Neill as * probably
the best non-starter in the
Southern Conference.”’

Coach Lefty Driesell agrees
with the statement with re-
spect to O'Neill's abilities,
but dismisses the idea of his
being a “sixth man.”

“Mike is a regular," said
Driesell, “in spite of the fact
that he didn't start much.
He did finish a number of
games, when the going got
rough.”

‘That's the way to mea-
sure a coach’s confidence in
a player's ability.”’ Driesell
said. “‘It's not who he starts.
but who he uses in the cru-
cial moments that counts."

Driesell noted that O'Neill
finished the Columbia, North
Carolina and St. John's
games last season, games

.. . best sixth man

which were close to the gun.

“As far as I'm concerned,”
Driesell said, “I'd just as
soon have Mike in there as
anyone. He is cool under pres-
sure, he has a good deal of
game experience and he's
one of the best free throw
shooters on the team. And
that counts fn the end.”

will host one of the tougher
Wildcat. games, when the Don
May-less Dayton squad plays.

An extremely tali team,
Dayton welcomes back 6-10
senior Dan Obrovac, 6-8

The Blue Devils come to
Charlotte this year bringing
with them two of the best
sophomore players in the
country in 5-10 guard Dick
DiVenzio and 6.10 center
Randy Denton.

Duke coach Vic Bubas is
worried about replacing Mike
Lewis and the inexperience
of the sophomores, but these
problems should resolve
themselves before the late
season meeting with David-
son.

Back from last year's 22-6
team are forward Steve
Vandenberg and guard Dave
Golden. both double-figure
scorers last season.

FURMAN

Furman is out to prove its

cammon and Jim Daly re-
turn from last year's team,
along with an impressive
junior college transfer, 6-6
Joe Brunson.

of Charles Selvy, Frank's
sophomore brother, and Fur-
man takes on the role of
spoiler the Southern Con-
ference.

GEORGE WASHINGTON

Another possible darkhorse
in the Southern is George
Washington, a cellar-dweller
last year.

Coach Wayne Dobbs wel-
comes back last year’s com-
plete starting team, along
with a 6-10 sophomore cen-
ter and 17-2 freshman squad.

Returning from the 5-19
team of last year are Fran-
cis Mooney. Steve Loveless
and Roger Strong.

game last year for an Oregon
junior college, and 6-1 junior
guard Chad Calabria.

MARYLAND

One of the contenders in
the Charlotte Invitational
Tournament this year, Mary-

land boasts some height in °

its returning men.

Will Hetzel, 6-7 brother of
Davidson all-American Fred,
joins 6-6 Rod Horst and 6-7
sophomore Dick Stobaugh in
the starting lineup. Pete
Johnson, a 6-1 guard, will
serve as playmaker for the
Terrapins.

MICHIGAN

All five starters return
from last year’s 11-13 Big
Ten team, including  all-
American candidate Rudy
Tomjonovich.

First year coach John Orr
expects an improved team
from last year, and sees one
of the keys to that expecta-
tion in 5-9 senior playmaker
Ken Maxey.

The Woiverines play the
Wildcats in Ann Arbor on
New Year's Eve.

PRINCETON

The ‘Davidson of the
North’ returns the key men

Davidsen should do its share
of winning this season.

Coach Lefty Driesell wel-
comes back his entire start-
ing lineup and most of his
reserves from last year, as
well as a few impressive
sophomores. ‘

The. starting five — Doug
Cook, Mike Maloy, Jerry
Kroll, Wayne Huckel and
Dave Moser — have never
lost as a starting five.

In speaking of the team
Driesell said, ‘‘We may have
had a better individual or
two when Fred Hetzel and
Dick Snyder were playing.
But I can’t recall having as
many good players as we'll
have this year.”

Maloy, the New York
junior, is the team’s top
candidate for national re-
cognition. He was named

Huckel, who was hospital-

definite candidate for all-

Moser, the team captain
and voted MVP by last year’s
team, will once again lead

Jan Essenburg. a 6-4 sopho-
more, is the top sophomore
threat on the squad, which
compiled a 9-12 record and
finished fourth in the SC.

WAKE

Sophomore star Gilbert
MacGregor, at 6-7, is the key
to a good season for Coach
Jack McCloskey’s Deacons
at Wake Forest.

McCloskey is relying heav-
ily on MacGregor's inside
ability to keep Wake in the
ACC running.

Back from last year's 5.21

Sophomore Kevin O’Rior-
dan will help the squad,
which hopes to better last

Kittens ‘Just Shy’
Of Full Strength

Barring unforeseen injur-
ies, the Wildcat freshman
team should be running full
force by its first game with
the VMI freshmen next Satur-
day.

The only doubtful starter
will be key wingman Bryan
Adrian, who injured his ankle
several weeks ago and mis-
sed three weeks of practice.

With a number of talented
reserves in the wings, the
team will probably start with
Doug Hill, Lester Strong,
Eric Minkin, Frank Clark
and Gary Scibal.

Minkin is the big man on
the squad, at 6-7. Freshman
Coach Jerry Conboy is rely-
ing on him for board
Strength. Strong, at 64, is
the team's best leaper. and
will be relied on for extra
board strength.

Hill will provide the play-
making for the team. Conboy
is quite pleased with his abil-
ity to stop and: hit from the
outside.
