Cable, from page 1

“Itdoesn’treally matter for people who don’t
want cable, and we shouldn’t feel that we’ve
been gypped if we have friends [at other
schools] who have cable.” -

“Cable would be nice,” said Christina Moore
’07. She added that cable should not be a prob-
lem for freshmen since other schools like
“Wake Forest have it and they’ re not all failing
out.”

Leslie Urban, Associate Director of Resi-
dence Life, said that the benefits of cable in-
clude “providing a service that [students] are
accustomed to having before coming here.”

While most students seemed to support the

cable decision, some were indifferent and some
thought it may be slightly detrimental. She

added, “In some aspects, cable can take away

from the interactions.”

“{Cable] gives people something to do, but

it is the really easy social option,” said fresh-
men hall counselor Brian Creech ’05. ,
He continued by saying that “the sense of
community needs to be built most,.and cable
could be an obstacle to building any type of
community.”
Jess Kolanski ’07 said, “I feel like if I had it

_ 1 would not watch it or watch it too much,”

adding that she didn’t need cable for most of
the shows she watches.

In October, the SGA presented its cable reso-
lution to the Council on Campus and Reli gious
Life, which acts as an advisory board to Presi-
dent Vagt. The CCRL passed the cable resolu-
tion by an eight to seven margin. The resolu-
tion that passed excluded freshmen, but Vagt
approved cable for all students.

Blues-rock group ‘Derek Trucks
Band’ to perform in Duke this spring

ZACH KAZIOR

Staff Writer

The Davidson College Concert Committee
has requested the Derek Trucks Band play in
the Duke Family Performance Hall this spring.

The decision was primarily based upon an
online voting survey conducted at the end of
last semester.

Besides the former, students could have
chosen from the following options: the North
Mississippi Allstars; Pat Green; Robert Earl
Keen; Jump, Little Children; Sound Tribe Sec-
tor 9; Nickelcreek; Keller Williams; and Howie
Day.

Of the eight options, Pat Green and
Nickelcreek were the two most requested
groups according to a poll of 1220 students,
but due to routing and cost, the concert com-
mittee was unable to book either of the bands.

The concert committee is commissioned to

do three shows a semester in the 900 room and *

one large show in Baker each semester. Smith
said that possibilities for the big concert in

Baker are Ben Folds, Maroon 5,0.A.R., and

one that’s “top secret.”
But in the hopes of expanding the types of
concerts produced on campus, the committee

petitioned the ATC, later SGA, for a grant to —

produce an extra show in Duke this spring.
The members of the concert committee are
very excited about the upcoming concert.

Liz Smith ’04, last semester’s concert com-
mittee chair, said, “Given that their sound
thrives off the incredible acoustics Duke main-
tains, we are looking forward to ‘christening’
the space with this band.”

The concert committee is now entering into
a period of negotiations with the Derek Trucks
Band’s agent and the union staff.

Derek Trucks, nephew of Butch Trucks of
the Allman Brothers Band, played two years
ago in the 900 Room to an audience of 300, a
record for the space.

A blues/blues-rock guitarist, Derek Trucks
has shared stages and played with such names
as the Allman Brothers Band, Bob Dylan, and
Buddy Guy. The band’s self-titled debut album
came out in 1997.

Their most recent album, “Joyful Noise,”
came out in 2002.

Although the concert committee is excited

about the upcoming concert, students had

mixed reviews about the survey.

Ben Meza ’06 thought that there was more
of a variety of choices last year.

“All rememberis that this year Irecognized
maybe two names. I don’t know if they were
all country stars or what, but I wasn’t a big fan
of the choices.”

The tentative date for the concert is a
day, February 5 at 9 p.m.

Student ticket sales are projected at $5, while

general admission is likely to be around $10.
