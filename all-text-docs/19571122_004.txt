The personable young man who answered the door

Inside, the rest of the family was finishing supper, look-

AFTER DANCE PARTIES

Q. “Is there much talk about
the after-dance parties?”

A. Professor McGavock: “This
is a favorite topic of conserva-
tion among the faculty, trustees,
and parents. We are more at
a loss to explain these than any
other phase (of. college life).”

Dr. McGavock expanded his
remarks to say that one of the
main arguments used to per-
suade the trustees to allow
dancing on the campus when
the question arose right after
World War II was that if stu-

the shoot must be sixteen and
over. There will be movies|
shown for the children, and
special booby prizes will also
be awarded.

IRC Group Gives
Policy Program

A representative group from
the Internationa] Relations Club
was invited to go to Winthrop
College Thursday to present a
program on American Foreign
Policy.

and the present educational
program dictated a responsibili-'
ty to Davidson's constituents “ini
terms of quality, definitely not!
quantity.”

Dr. Spencer believed that the
most pressing of Davidson's
problems was the selection of
the right president. He empha-
sized the need of
faculty salaries and especially
more creative imagination and
new ideas. “We have been pretty
conservative at Davidson.” was
his observation.

He has just returned from a
two weeks visit to various col-
leges in the Southwest and Mid-
west when he observed general
educational problems through-
out a large portion of the na-
tion.

He is planning a similar trip
to the Northeast, in an effort
to become more thoroughly
oriented toward his responsi-
bilities as a college president.
Davidson compared quite fa-
vorably to the institutions he
visited.

MARY BALDWIN

Dr. Spencer explained that
Mary Baldwin, which has an

The program was one in a
series which Winthrop College
had this week in observance of
United Nations Week.

The IRC members who rep-
resented Davidson were Maur-
ice Ritchie, Carl Sparman,
Spencer Mitchem, Jim Steel,
and Hugo Misle.

They discussed, respectively,
America's Foreign Policy toward
France, Scandinavia, England,
Russia, and the Middle East.

increased |

Baldwin’s student body is much
more cosmopolitan.

There is a development pro-
gram under way there now. The
enrollment will likely be in-
creased to 350 next year and
eventually, in the next several
years, to 500.

“It is just as economically

|

logical for Mary Baldwin to in-| .

crease her enrollment as it is
for Davidson to maintain its
present number,” stated Dr.
Spencer. Their present faculty-
student ratio is 1-10. and David-
sun’s ratio is 1-15.

There is a_ possibility that
the Mary Baldwin campus may
be re-located in the outskirts of
Staunton rather than to attempt
further expansion in the heart
of town.

VISIT HIS GIRLS!

Dr. Spencer expressed a con-
tinued interest in the Davidson
student body by asking the in-
terviewer several pertinent
questions about campus prob-
Jems and contemporary issues.
He expressed a desire to see
more Davidson boys coming to

our Series last year.

MAXIMUM NUMBER
Q. “What do you think the

* top limit on the number of boys

in a fraternity should be?”
, &. Professor McGavock: “IT
think that a fraternity fails in
‘its main purpose when the mem-
bership becomes too large. Per-
haps 50 members should be the
upper limit. My own experience
was to belong to a fraternity in
the days when the average size
; was 30 members.
| “Almost all of these fraterni-
ty brothers were close friends
in the truest sense of the word.
Most of these fine friendships
have continued through the
years. It was not Hell Week
that cemented our bonds’ of
brotherhood but a genuine in-
terest in one another and in
the common interests that arose
through close associations.

“To say that a_ fraternity
group can only be wielded to-

tem and a quota system. The
advantages of these (‘we can’t
have a quota system without a
preferential bidding system")
would be twofold.

Primarily these two things
would help the fraternities in
that they would be limited to
about 55 to 60 members. “It
is not a real fraternity when you

have sixty boys, and with
80... that’s a club!”

He pointed out that in refer-

program and life, this in an
“inconsistant sort of thing.”
