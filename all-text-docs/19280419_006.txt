:-of “¥’-Inirusted to New

Cabinet in Impressive Ceremony Led

by Members of Old and New Groups

“The supreme need of Davidson College
today is not a greater endowment fund, not
finer buildings,” said Charlie McRae, retir-
ing president of the Y. M. C._A.,, in his
charge to the incoming officers*and members
of the cabinet, “but for the students to come
into a closer and more binding fellowship
with Jesus Christ.” 5

Taking as the basis for his discussion’ the
well-known statement, “Great men are al-
ways lonely,” McRae presented Christ as
typical of. a man living alone, engaging con-
stantly in prayer with His Father, the only
one with whom He could in reality commune.

“Still,” continue McRae; “Jesus longed
for friendship and still longs for it. The
possibilities of a man’s fellowship with
Christ are unlimited and incomprehensible.” |

In closing McRae charged the newly elect-
ed officers and cabinet to realize their oppor-
tunity to lead men into a closer fellowship
with Christ, and cause them to cease living
merely for the present and cast their eyes

Program Announced
for Commencement

Completion of‘ preliminary arrangements
for the ninety-second annual Commencement
exercises of Davidson College was announced
by Dr. W. J. Martin, president of the insti-
tution. The Commencement program will
formally open at 11 o’clock Sunday morning,
May 27th, with a baccalaureate sermon to be
preached by Dr. Frank S. Morgan, pastor of
the First Presbyterian Church of Augusta,
Ga., son of Campbell Morgan, famous
evangelist.

The special Y. M. C, A. Commencement
vesper services, will be featured with an ad-
dress by Rev. H. W. DuBose, D.D., pastor |
of the First Presbyterian Church at Spar-
tanburg, S. C, These services will follow
the baccalaureate: sermon, and will be at-
tended by a large number of parents and
visitors to the college.

_ into the future.

John Melton, president of the “Y” for the |
coming year, accepted, the charge presented |
by McRae and pledged himself and the new |
cabinet to a greater work for Christ at Da-
vidson. Comparing the taking over of the
“Y” work by the new officers to the running
of a relay, he brought out the fact that each
succeeding runner must carry the baton on,
but that he* must increase his efforts over
those of the other man. And so with the
“Y,” efforts must be made continually to rise
to higher and better things in the way of
Christian living. Melton summed up the
program of the “Y” for the coming year in
the following text: “Seek ye first the King-
dom of God and His Righteousness and all
these things shall be added unto you.”

“The country today needs great men,” con-
tinued Melton, “not only of great physical
and mental powers but men who have the
Spirit of Christ. These are the truly great
men.” t

He presented another desired aim of the
“Y” as being able to put Jesus Christ every-
where on the campus, in the hearts of the
students so that they may seek first the
Kingdom of God; then these earthly things

Class day exercises for the graduating |
class of 129 members are scheduled for Mon-

shall be added. He pled for the co-operation
of every Davidson man in attempting this
great achievement.

The duties of the members of the student
body were put before them by Jim Appleby,
secretary of the “Y.” Jim spoke on “Why
the ‘Y’?” and brought out some of the ways
it is important to the students. He told of
the turmoil going on in the mind of the
average student, and how his mind is con-
stantly filled with religious doubt and rest-
lessness,

“If one would know the doctrines of reli-
gion and truth,” said Jim, “he must believe
in God and do His will. Then only will he
have satisfaction and understanding.”

Jim challenged the new cabinet to give the
students an opportunity to serve, sacrifice,
and come closer to Jesus Christ. His chal-
lenge to the students was to so serve as to
do His will and bring others to know Christ.

Fresh Team Beats

Charlotte School!

By defeating Charlotte High School 5-3
last Thursday, April 12th, the Wildkittens
administered to Charlotte the first defeat of |
this year. The Freshmen showed some good |
playing although several errors were made.
The Charlotte team put up a nice fight but
could not compete with the fast Freshman
team.

The feature of the game was the pitching
of the Fresh ace, “Buck” Marrow. "Marrow
struck out 14 men during the nine innings;
in the last three inings Marrow struck out
nine men. Armfield led the locals at the
bat by getting two. three-base hits and a
single in four times up.’ Proctor was run-
ner-up for batting honors, with a two-bagger
and a single, in four times up.

Twenty years, ago a visit to Charlotte was
considered quite a journey, and the wording
of the following item appearing in The Ob-
server several days ago, under the caption,
“Twenty Years Ago,” seems to indicate that
Dr. Harding had come from a distant point:
“Dr. C. R. Harding, of the faculty of Da-
vidson College, arrived in the city last night
and will conduct services at Westminster
Presbyterian Church today and tonight.”

CAROLINA TAKES SECOND

In the State golf tournament, played at,

the Sedgefield County Club, in Greensboro,
on April 14th, between. Davidson, Carolina,
Duke, and Wake Forest, the Davidson team,
composed of Martin, Mills, Wilson and Lin-
gle, took second place.

In this tournament of 36 holes medal-play
Carolina took first place, Davidson second,
Duke third, and Wake Forest fourth.

Martin, of Davidson, tied for low medalist
with Loyster, of Carolina, in the tournament
and won the championship after playing two
extra holes. The winners of the tourna-
ment were presented with two beautiful lov-
ing cups, one going to the Carolina team and
the other going to Boyce Martin, as low
medalist.

tinued its winning stride Saturday by turn-
ing back a fast but unavailing Gettysburg
University team; 6-0. It was the fifth
straight intercollegite victory for the Da-
vidson netmen this season.

The Gettysburg net stars, now on an ex-
tended tour of the South, found their David-
son opponents too strong in every department
of court play with the result that the Penn-
sylvania lads lost both the doubles and singles
matches without once threatening the local
players. Not until the final doubles match
of the day did the Easterners have the Da-
vidson players trailing. In that match, the
longest and most exciting of the afternoon,
Hood and Lauer, of Gettysburg, had Roddey
and Carr, of Davidson, five games. behind.
The Pennsylvanians were unable to maintain
their lead, however, and lost the match to
the Davidson team in straight sets, 10-8 and
6-2. Other results were:

Singles: Roddey, of Davidson, defeated
Hood, of Gettysburg, 6-3,.6-0; Haverstadt,
of Davidson, defeated Lauer, of Gettysburg,
6-3, 6-3; Johnston, of Davidson, defeated
Uhler, of Gettysburg, 6-1, 6-0;.Carr, of Da-
vidson, defeated Koch, of Gettsburg, 7-5, 6-3.

Doubles: Roddey and Carr, of Davidson,
defeated Hood and Lauer, of Gettysburg,
10-8, 6-2; Halverstadt and Johnston, of Da-
vidson, defeated Koch and Signer, of Getts-
burg, 6-1, 6-1.

The Davidson team left yesterday for the
University of North Carolina, where it is to
enter the North Carolina Intercollegiate
tournament, which extends through today,
Friday and Saturday, and. which will be en-
tered by all North Caroélina colleges. Fol-
lowing this the team will meet Carolina on
Monday and Duke on Tuesday.
