Mideast talks resume

Egyptian President Anwar Sadat
and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem
Begin moved slowly back this week to
their positions prior to Sadat’s walk-
out from diplomatic talks January 19.

Early last week Israel refused to
continue military talks as a counter-
move to the walk-out. Both sides
cited insults and ultimatums as
reasons for the break.

Israel drafted a set of principles as
a basis for further talks and on
Monday, January 30, the Israeli
Parliament voted to resume direct
negotiations.

Sadat plans a trip to the U.S. and

various European countries this week
to gain support and to pressure
Israel.

Committee approves treaty

The Panama Canal Treaty was
approved,14-1, in the Senate Foreign
Relations. Committee January 31.

The treaty was sent to the Senate
with a recommendation that a memo
of understanding between President
Carter and Torrijos be included in the
existing articles.

The committee also amended the
treaty with a statement on U.S.
rights to defend the Canal’s neutrality
and the U.S. right of first entry in the
event of an emergency. It is estimated
that 70 of 100 Senators may approve
the treaty.

NATO strengthens forces

The Department of Defense an-
nounced long range plans to strength-
en military forces of NATO January
ali

The plans include deployment of
neutron bombs, an increase in trident
submarines, and the phasing out of
Polaris submarines.

NATO General Alexander Haig
called for higher western defense
spending to counteract Warsaw
Pact’s increasing strength on Janu-
ary 30.

Fiscal budget announced

The proposals include a tax cut to
consumers and businesses, totalling

$33.9 billion with a deficit of $60.6).

$500.2 billion. This increase of eight
percent over last year’s budget in-
cludes larger allocations to defense
education ($30.4 billion), energy ($9.6
billion), foreign aid ($5.4 billion), and
mass transit ($2.3 billion).

The Wall Street Journal stated this
week that the budget emphasizes
Carter’s fiscal restraint and prudent
management. There were few reor-
ganizations or cut backs, while some
social allocations (urban projects and
health) were postponed.

Intervention discouraged

The Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee recommended January 26 that
the U.S. forcefully discourage that
internationals have. aggravated the
apartheid.

The leader of the Zulu’s (South,
Africa’s largest black tribe) spoke to
10,000 blacks Januaty 30 at a
peaceful gathering in Soweta, saying
that they had reached the crossroads
in the fight for racial equality.

Odds and ends

The Sun Belt may gain nine seats in
the House of Representatives due to
population shifts.

A survey of college freshmen by the
American Council of Education found
that 57 percent claim to be politically
middle-of-the-road,. two percent on
the far left, and one percent of the far
right of the political spectrum.

Last year’s trade deficit was $26.72
billion. The reason cited for the heavy
increase was the U.S. reliance on
imported oil. An expected rise of five
percent in exports is not enough to
offset projected increases in imports
in 1976.

‘Devon reviewed

[Continued from page 1]
The students on the Com-

mittee were also concerned
that faculty members have not
voiced protest over Devon's
non-renewal. ‘‘I’m outraged at
the lack of any action by the
faculty. It seems to me they
have a moral obligation at
least to investigate, but it’s
their own conscience,’’ re-
marked one of the students.
Wolf said that everyone on
the PAC had read the letter
and indicated that it would be
discussed at the committee’s
next meeting Wednesday.

He said the PAC had been
asked in December to deter-
mine whether constitutional
procedure had been followed
while Devon was under con-
sideration for renewal.

The College Constitution
states that ‘The faculty mem-
ber will be advised, at the time
of initial appointment of the
substantive standards and
procedures generally em-
ployed in decisions affecting
renewal and tenure.The facul-
ty member will be advised of
the time when the decisions
affecting renewal or tenure are
ordinarily made and will be
given the opportunity to sub-
mit material which he believes
will be helpful to an adequate
consideration of his circum-
stances.”

“The PAC played no role in
the evaluation of Dr. Devon’s
qualifications. The PAC could
only question whether or not
constitutional procedure was

followed,’ Wolf explained.

Devon was aware that a
contract renewal decision
would be made by December
15 but, Wolf said, the PAC
questioned whether or not
Devon had been given ‘‘ample
opportunity’’ to submit ma-
terials to defend her programs
and teaching. Wolf explained
that Zimmermann met with
Devon subsequently to give
her a chance to defend her
case.

“After that second meeting,
as far as we can tell with the
written procedures we have in
the College Constitution, pro-
cedure had been followed in
her evaluation,’’ Wolf re-
marked.

“The PAC will, however,
discuss the letter and its
implications to see if there are
any new areas that need to be
investigated,” commented
Wolf.

Wolf added that the PAC
has been concerned with the
problem of renewal of con-
tracts and the role of student,
faculty, and administrative
evaluations for at least ten
years.

The PAC has been anxious
to see a set of specific guide-
lines for contract renewal eval-
uation set up by the adminis-
tration,” said Wolf. He offered
his views on the procedure: ‘‘I
think what could be done is to
put into writing what proce-
dures and standards will be
generally applied in evaluating
faculty.’”’

that the program would have

“Tt would have been better
if they had waited until e-
nough people had been hired,”
commented Latta. ‘‘Mr,
Meetze assured ‘us that he
would hire people as soon as
possible and we wouldn’t work
much overtime.”

“Once they hire enough
people, I think the school will
be a lot safer than before,”
said Burton.

“Yeah, but right now, it’s a
mess,’’ replied Latta.
