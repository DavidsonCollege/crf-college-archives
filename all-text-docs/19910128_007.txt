Stop The Madness: Shoot The Healthy

There exists a scourge, dear
friends. A scourge so vile I am
almost too repulsed to write. Yet
as I consider my mission of wamn-
ing a most noble and necessary

D.A.
Thompson

calling, I shall convey to you my
counsel. (As a matter of fact, I did
just watch the Shakespeare play.)

It all started in those God for-
saken 80’s. I had so hoped that the
common conscious would have had
the strength and resolve needed to
abandon it along with those awful
years. Alas, many fools have held
fast and brought it with them into

the new world order. That’s right,
I’m talking about this health and

fitness outrage.

The consumer culture has once
again been duped. I am plainly
aghast that so many people are
working out in this era of supposed
enlightenment. Quite simply, this
nonsense must come to a full and
complete halt. Heed these words,
lest-ye find-yourself subject.to the
dire consequences of being “in
shape”.

Exercise in almost any form is
an unutterably boring waste of your
ever fleeting and oh so very pre-
cious time. Know you not, you
abominable aerobicisers, the
wealth of joys you pass up in the
course of your desperate plea for a
“better” figure? Really, people,
there are books to be read, sym-
phonies to be heard, and Simpsons
to be watched!

Have you been too busy pump-
ing yourselves into deformed
masses of over inflated muscle
tissue.to face the absurdity of your
existence? The factis that we must
all face death. None shall escape,
no matter how trim or well toned.
Why prolong the inevitable? Sit
down, light a filter-free cigarette,
puta Twinkie in the oriface of your
choice, and wholeheartedly em-
brace your meager and meaning-
lessness mortality! Stop kidding
yourselves, you warthogs of work-
ing out; a tight buttocks does not a
life fulfill. ;

Most fit people say that they
feel better than they did before

they began working out. Oh, re-
ally? How often did they complain
of groin injuries, pulled muscles,
athlete’s foot, and jock itch before
they engaged in these perverted
acts of masochism?

What do the exercisers know
about feeling “better”, anyway?
Better than what? Not than the
way I feel while watching the To-
day show with that first cup of
coffee and second cig of the day

essence of civilization.

By succumbing to the cunning
ploys of such monstrosities as the
Nike corporation, more and more
once upstanding Americancitizens
of positive moral fiber and a patri-
otic bent, have inadvertently
crippled our nation’s economy.
Just how many of those obnoxious
little sneakers and sweatsuits are
produced in the good ol’ U.S. of
A., anyway? Next to none. In-

Have you been too busy pumping yourselves
into deformed masses over inflated muscle

(the first having been smoked while
I was still in bed), that’s for damn
sure.

The aerobically aware tell us
that exercise is an essential part of
a healthy life. Suckers! More
injuries result from their ridicu-
lous activities in a single week
than I’ll suffer in a decade. They
spend twice as much on medical

. bills than ever will on lighter fuel.

But some of these psychotics
still claim that they like to exer-
cise; and were they not a threat to
us all, I would probably just leave
them alone. But being in shape is
upsettingly un-American, not to
mention antithetical to the very

Aggression On the Home>
Front: Where Are The ae

Less than two weeks ago, Presi-
dent Bush gave the order to bomb
Iraq. He professed his goals to be
liberating Kuwait, stopping the
aggression of a madman, and

implementing this new. world or-
der that is supposedly upon us.
While leaving the debate on such
an engagement to more foreign

policy minded scholars (7), I can-
not but help think that similar evils
are much closer to home.

_ I spent some time last week in
the inner city of Charlotte with the
Awareness Weekend and was
struck by the enslavement and
aggression, whether recognized or
not, thatoccurs in the city. A priest
at an inner city church told of two
girls, age 15 and 17, who turned to

homosexuality, because the only
love they experienced from males
was rape. A group of Davidson
students talked witha boy who isa
senior in high school. When asked
what he was doing that night, he

* said that he had to go shoot some-

one to even a score.

Stories like these abound in -

many parts of the United States.

streets.

The kind of aggression we are
so determined to stop in the Middle
East occurs daily in America. It
seems that every time you looked
at a newspaper last year, you read
of some city breaking their record
for murders, Our nation’s capital
had something like 450 murders
last year alone, Murder is the ulti-

.-. the people of the United States have overthe
years become content to elect to office indi-
viduals who can be relied upon to be evil,
selfish, loathsome so-and so's for them.

Given that these evils do not
Order,” the aggression and oppres-
sion that is found here, however, is
none the less real and equally en-
slaving to the victims.

The rallying -cry for action
lately has been the taking back of
the Kuwaiti homeland. Whatabout
the hundreds of homeless that
subsist only because of the Up-
town Day Shelter in Charlotte? By
no means am I trying to deempha-
size the severity of the Iraqi crime
against the people of Kuwait.

On the contrary, this feeling of
sympathy we have for the latter
needs to be matched by an equal
outburst of support for those with-
out a home and those facing daily
aggression in our own cities and

mate exhibition of aggression, and
it happens more frequently in
America than most other coun-
tries. Just like the Kuwaiti people
were forced out of fear into seclu-
sion or exodus, the same happens
in our cities.

People either flee to the sub-
urbs or do not go out at night for
fear of muggers, rapists, and the
like. How can we: honestly con-
demn Hussein’s evils while at the
same time allowing similar acts of
violence to happen everyday and
in every way in America?

Americans must open her col-
lective eyes and condemn the
aggression herein exactly the same
way we are against Iraq. In many
ways Kuwait and America must
both be liberated. .

stead of spending their probably
embezzled dollars on good solid
American products, like really big
cars and trucks, these swine use
their money to keep the impover-
ished as such in far away places
like Korea.

Don’t any of you find it just a
little suspicious that the chairman

of the President’s Council on
Physical fitness is both from East-
em Europe, and married to a Ken-
nedy? Remember, too, that the
man who is currently leading us

_ into both war and fiscal ruin is also

an avid jogger.

Most people who exercise are
also just plain rude. Don’t you
realize that you smell? How dare
you come to dinner in your stink-
ing, sweat soaked togs, and expect
to eat anywhere near those of us
who engage ina proper regimen of
personal hygiene? I am more
staunchly opposed to perspiration
than mostanything, and have spent
a lifetime doing everything I could
to avoid it. [certainly do not appre-
ciate those disgustingly inconsid-
erate members of our community
who so enjoy milling about the
campus swathed in their own ex-
cretions.

Finally, I must ask: what ex-
actly are we supposed to think about
these “Just Do It” ads? Does the

Time to Shelve the
Flag: A Good Ol'
Boy Perspective

By Derrick Willard '91

I was struck by a remark made
by Rafael Candelario in The
Davidsoniantwo weeks ago. “Why
would I want to go ina room where
a Confederate flag bigger than I
am is hanging on the wall, repre-
senting everything I hate ?” asked
Candelario. The force of this quote
actually made me think of being in.
his shoes. What is seen as a proud
relic to many Southerners, the
Confederate flag, is a symbol of
oppression and hatred to many
others. I won’t say I know how a
black feels about this issue, but I
feel I can get a sense from this
quote,

For those sensing the impend-
ing polemic, let.me say that I am
proudly born and bred a South-
emer. I was raised on the outskirts
of a fairly small Southern town in
a-largely rural county. My friends
at Davidson often label me a “Red
Neck,” but I know a trip to my
home town would show them the
real thing. I have lived in the

eyed peas (but abhor collard
greens). And I love my roots--the
term “Red Neck” often arouses my
ire when people use it haughtily to
label those from small towns.
But I also recognize the darker
side of the Southern cult or myth-
-the continuation of the Civil War.
Granted, it is a complex issue, one
I cannot resolve in this editorial.
Granted, all Southerners have not
oppressed blacks or developed a
hatred of them.. But, out of this
war, this critical eventof the South-
em myth came a legacy of oppres-
sion and hatred attached to all
Southerners. Whether or not we as
Southerners (or those damn Yan-
kees who pretend they are) wish to
show these negative actions or
emotions, we do so when we so
proudly display the Confederate
flag. I do not deny anyone’s right
todo as he pleases, I just ask those
Southem (or pseudo-Southern) flag
brandishers to consider the state-
ment they make to those who see
the Confederate flag as a symbol
