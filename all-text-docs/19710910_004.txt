cult to look at the accomplishments o1 the paper ier
the past spring with unmixed feelings.

Several of our campaign promises of jas: vear
remain unfulfilled. -

We have not used the paper as a means of heip-
ing Davidson merge with the other Charlotte col-
leges into a larger inteliectual community. We hate
not had the opportunity to be as innovative as we
would have liked in the lavout and content of the
newspaper itself. THE DAVIDSONIAN has not been
the educational asset that it should be to the cam-

Ss.

But things have. we believe, been right with the
paper as well. Despite our minimal staff last vear.
we are quite pleased with the depth of coverage we
were able to provide. We feel comfortable with our
analysis style of coverage. interpreting campus events.
not distorting them.

This fall we look to implement several new con-
cepts, some in the immediate future. others later in
the term.

We hope to have regular guest columns bv the
faculty on issues within their field. issues which are
important to the students. We want to give more
attention to the world around us, Charlotte. North
Carolia, the country and beyond. We hope to use
more pictures to enhance the acsthetic appeal of the
paper.

Communication, whatever means
our end.

There are important issues facing Davidson and
Davidson students. It is our hope to be able to give
careful complete coverage to several issues which
we feel are of considerable import to Davidson —
including :coeducation. fiscal policies. community re-
lations, academic innovations. and student participa-
tion in policy decisions.

We hope it works.

Student Votes

The question of student voter registration and
residency requirements is a difficult one. a question
frought with tensions and fears.

The question is now headed for the courts where
‘the legality of the residency statutes of North Caro-
lina will be questioned.

The problem is now headed for the courts where
dents who live for only four years on campus be
legitimately precluded from voting while the young
executive, in town for a vear and a half is eligible?
Oan we be residents for the census, used for redis-
tricting, and then be ignored as voters? Is it- legiti-
mate to ask for an oath of intent (for permancy of
residence) of one group of people and not another?

The fear which the people in towns like Green-
ville, Cullowhee, Davidson and Chapel Hill have is
understandable. The student enrollment at the col-

it requires, is

leges in these towns can have a major impact on local’

politics. Studénts are in and out in four vears.
Bond elections and their consequences don’t. move
along with the class of 1973. -

The townspeople are afraid of a Berklevesque
takeover of the political structures.

But at the same time the Mecklenburg Repub-
licans might well fear a Democratic takeover. If stu-
dents, or a black-student alliance, hold more votes
than the current administration. then it is their de-
mecratic right to control office and make the ad-
ministrative decisions.

Aside from the theoretical standpoint. our ob-
servation would be that the town of Davidson has
really very little to fear from a court decision which
would permit Davidson students to vote here.

Most will still.vote at home, feeling more com-
fortable with the issues and candidates there. Furth-
er, a 70% turnout in an SGA election is considered
excellent. The guess would be that a town council
election in Davidson would rank just a couple of
steps lower in excitement for the typical student here.

What We Really Need Is

It’s a year. later and |
must now address myself to
follow-up ques-
tion. ‘‘Now that you’ve been
what did you learn?”

To begin with, the assump

ing feminine in orientation

typically male — “the girls
would feel inhibited in a co-
ed classroom;'" most girls
still structure their weeks

campuses: and most. will

say some not all—not most

with varying degrees of re-
‘lection of the traditionally

ed im ‘American culture.

The rejection usually be-
gins with that all-important
college ritual, the blind date.
The girl goes to W&L for
the weekend, is pawed for
three days, enticed with
liquor, and made to feel tex-
actly like what the guy
wants: two tits and an ass.

If she’s more than that.
it doesn't take very long for
her to get sick of it. Unlike
the acquiescents, who stick
jt out until they find some
guy who either isn't all hands
or has compensation for be-
ing so (like a GTO. good
looking fraternity brothers
or a position in his father's
law firm) some girls refuse
to play the game...

Their rejection of the blind-
date syndrome and all it con-
notes may range from more |
discriminatory acceptance of |
dates to complete refusal to |
date at all.

Let's pause for a minute
to answer the question, “Why a]
do college boys vie for the }

f

Giant Squid Awhrd to begin
with?’’ Part of it is the
implicit horniness of male
college students ; especially
males in an all male en-
viron.

But the main'reason guys
inflict themselvés on girls
is the great fear of Post-Col-
lege Virginity, You come to
college to learn. and one of
the things vou learn is how
to score. The stigma carried
by failing to score is much
greater than that of failing
Biology 21.

It's taken for granted that
if vou don't make it, you
can't make it. So that if
you don't. you sure as hell
make everybody think you
do: hence the all-pervasive
fear of virginity and the
consequent obsession to de-
virginize oneself.

Unfortunately, devirginiz-
ing oneself (heterosexually,
at least) requires a female—
not all of whom are willing
to be the instrument of one’s
devirginization—which brings
us back to the point of de-
parture of this tangent.

We were speaking of a
girl's rejection of the blind-
date syndrome. More im-
portint than the resultant
dating (or non dating) pat-
tern is the introspection
which is usually precipitat-
ed by the rejection of the
college socral system. This
introspection (what is wrong
with me?) turns to analysis
of the system (Why is it like
this?) and finallyy to exam-

in name only.

What does all this mean
for the Davidson man? It
means he can stay as he is
and get a marshmellow
brain. or he can start re-
structuring his thinking and
actions.

It means he is going to
be confronted by a new kind
of woman and a new kind of
relationship—one in which he
must be secure enough in
himself to be liberated from
archaic notions of what com-
prises masculinity.

To sum it up—when it
comes to ‘“‘the male role in
life’’ we could use a good
dose of men’s lib.

To The Editor: co

Re: ‘“‘Delt's KA’s Return
to Court” July-August, 1971,
T am shocked and dismayed
that THE DAVIDSONIAN
would print the above ar-
ticle which contains false in-
formation. The paragraph to
which I refer is as follows:

Although the town council
in June zoned against board-
ing houses in residential
areas, members of the SPE
claim they had settled on
their house and began opera-
tions before the zoning law
was passed.

At the meeting of the Town
Council in June (at which I
was present) James Wil-
liams, an SPE alumnus, stat-
ed that the house.had not
been bought yet because of
a problem with the title. Sub-
sequent to the meeting, the
Property was surveyed. ,

Until the middle of ‘June.
Charles Cornwell, member
of the Davidson faculty, liv-
ed in the house. After he va-
cated. the Tom Williams
moved back in. They did not
move out until July.

Thus, the boarding house
has not been and cannot be
operated because North Main
Street is in a_ residential
area. The house also cannot
be used as a fraternity be-
cause there is a town ordi-

ERENT ANNE ER NEN

nance of long standing pro-
hibiting fraternity houses in
residential areas. It seems
that the SPE fraternity or
their representatives-have a
house to rent because they
bought it after the town or-
dinances were passed.

Boarding houses and fra-
ternity houses can be oper-
ated in. areas zoned institu-
tional, industrial, or business
in the Town of Davidson.
They cannot be operated in
any residential areas.

I am also surprised that
men would pledge large
amounts of money for the
purchase of a house before
they knew the zoning facts.
Maybe Davidson men aren't
as smart as I’ve always
thought!
