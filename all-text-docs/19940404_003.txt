Kappa Sig runs to support MADD

Fifth annual race aims to raise over $2000

By Mary Laura Moretz

In honor of two fraternity
brothers killed in a 1989 drunk
driving accident in Cheraw, NC,
Kappa Sig held their fifth annual
63-mile MADD run. Held this
past Saturday, the event aimed to
raise $2000 for Mothers Against
Drunk Driving,

The tradition began after the.

deaths of John (John-O) Reynolds,
a freshman member of the class of
1992, and Patrick Virtue, a Kappa
Sig at the University of Colorado.
The two freshmen were friends
from Salisbury, North Carolina.

John Cook'92, who advises in
the planning of the run, came up
with the idea to run all the way to
Salisbury in memory of Reynolds
and Virtue. Before the accident,
the Kappa Sigs held a MADD run
to Charlotte.

A native of Salisbury and
friend of the Reynolds and Vir-
tues, Cook says that the two fami-
lics host a reception for family,
friends, and the runners who come
through the town.

The trip stretched from
Davidson to Salisbury and back —
about 63 miles. Brothers signed
up to run specific legs of the trip.

Sophomore J.D. DuPuy, ser-
vice chairman at Kappa Sig and
coordinator of the run, says,
“Mostly Kappa Sig brothers run it
but anyone else can, too. We got a
lot of people, because pretty much
the’whole house participates.” ’

Cook says, “I run the four
miles between the two houses and
one mile with Mr. Virtue, Pat’s

father.”

Kappa Sig brothers sought
donations from North Carolina
businesses before the run. Large
donations earned the businesses’
logos a place on the T-shirts that
were sold on Saturday. The past
four runs have raised over $8000

for MADD.

The course began at 8:00 Sat-
urday morning and ended around
5:00 with a celebration on the

Davidson town green. DuPuy, who °

also ran his freshman year, says the
trip may be long, but “it’s a lot of
fun.”

Award reinforces love of teaching

By Court McBryde

“Dr. Putman’s classes are chal-
lenging. He incorporates humor
into his lecture and he’s always
cager to teach,” said senior biol-
ogy major Will Caldwell. Dr.
Jeremiah Putman of the biology
department received the Hunter-
Hamilton Love of Teaching Award
in 1992.

A Davidson College profes-
sor will be awarded the third an-
nual Hunter-Hamilton Love of
Teaching Award at the 1994 com-
mencement exercises.

The Selection Committee is
seeking nominations from current
students, alumni, and faculty.

Mathematics professor Benjamin
Klein chairs the committee. Klein
said that he applauds this award for
“being serious about rewarding
good teaching; it reinforces the
importance of,teaching.”

Putman began teaching at
Davidson in 1973. He teaches
comparative anatomy and histol-
ogy, runs the electron microscope,
and currently serves as the Pre-
medical Director.

“There are a lot of reasons
why I love teaching. I enjoy the
students and my discipline. I have
always liked to explain and sim-
plify things; it is a passion,” said
Putman.

Putman said one of the great-
est rewards of teaching is that “stu-
dents telling you that you have
made a difference in their live as
and that they appreciate what you
have done for them.

"The smallness of Davidson
gives me the opportunity to know
the students well and to establish
personal contact with them,”
Putman said+

Dr. Charles E. Ratliff of the
economics department received the
awardin 1991, The Selection Com-
mittee welcomes nominations for
this year's award until April 11,
1994. Nomination forms are avail-
able in Chambers 111

Candlelight vigil for victims of sexual assault

Night continued from page |

Senior Heather Flint spoke
to offer practical advice about rape
situations. She stressed that vic-
tims of sexual assault should not
take a shower before going to po-
lice because showering would erase
most of the evidence that could
lead toa conviction of the offender.

Nance Longworth, a counse-
lor at the Davidson College Coun-
seling Center and mentor of
Davidson’s rape support group,
encouraged anyone with questions
regarding sexual assault to go to
the counseling center.

Participants were asked to list

places where they knew sexual
assault had occurred. Later,
Orsbon said that the majority of
the places listed were cities in the
United States and that about 40 to
50 percent of them happened at
Davidson.

The Committee for Women’s
Issues closed the event with a
candlelight vigil between the chem-
istry building and the Union. Par-
ticipants received red ribbons to
tie around each other’s wrists to
commemorate survivors of sexual
assault. The committee also placed
a ribbon tree in the Union Pit to
symbolize these survivors. Addi-
tional ribbons are available to those

who.wish to add to the tree.
Orsbon felt this year’s “Take Back
the Night” was a success and was
delighted by the number of men
present. “The more men the bet-
ter,” said Orsbon. “I don’t think
that it’s just a women’s issue be-
cause it can happen to your girl-
friend, your sister, your mother, or
someone that you work with.”

Sophomore Jen Leaman de-
scribed her “Take Back the Night”
experience as “a reality check.”
She said, “It makes you realize
how prevalent sexual assault is and
that everyone at Davidson can be
affected by it .”

SGA senators and freshman honor council elections on Tuesday.
