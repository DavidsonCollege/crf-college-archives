Though the Wildcats lost a couple at the
beginning of the season there is plenty of
promise that with a little more experience
we will have a corking good nine in the
field. The hitting seems to be picking up
right along and according to all the sport
maniacs on the campus that was to be the
weak point with the Wildcats this year.
Last year’s squad hit around .300, but with
Crawford, Brice, Vance and Boushee ham-
mering the old pill the way they have in
the first couple of games, .300 isn’t so far
out of sight.

Captain Pat

Last year we needed pitchers and before
the season was over three dependable pitch-
ers were forthcoming. This year we have
the making of an all around team but they
need a bunch of pep behind them Stick
with them, boys, and let ‘em know that we
are on the side lines pulling for them,

Brice

It looks like we always play our ball
games on the wrong days. We practice
when it is clear, and play a game every cold
and nasty day that comes along. Some-
body please speak to the weather man.

Richards

Anybody that was in Gastonia knows that
the Wildcats are a scrapping bunch this
year. With eight runs against them in the
second inning most teams would have quit
trying but not so with Captain Pat’s ar-
senic aggregation. They were right there
with the fight and played all around the
Tarheels the rest of the game.

Sion Alford

Speaking of Gastonia, Manager Elliot
says he got dizzy watching the men run
bases in the Second inning, Any team will
go up in the air every now and then though,

ATHLETICS

on the ground they stuck there.
Covington

The way the Freshmen wrecked the Jun-
iors in that football game during Junior
Speaking was terrible. Crown Prince Young
and Jerry Fenton were the most in need of
the Red Cross. In “ye good ole days” be-
fore the death of D. C. Hazing, the Fresh-
men wouldn't have dared to frock the upper
classmen. Remember last December—after
that 14-14 Fresh-Soph game.. There was a
whole lot better sportsmanship this year, and
better Fresh teams all around.

Vance

The Wildcat track artists nosed one over
on South Carolina ‘in their first meet, and
got a measure of revenge for the defeat on
Sprunt Field last year; but from the records
of their next two oponents it looks like they
will have their work cut out for them. N.
C. State beat Trinity, 93-33, kind of step-
ping on them, we would say; and Clemson
romped away with the University of Geor-
gie, 76-36. Two years ago Clemson beat
Davidson in track, about 80-30. We won-
der if they can do it again this year, and on
Sprunt Field?

Frank Alford

N. C. State is the only undefeated Caro-
lina team, and has a string of victories over
Navy, Maryland, Guiford, Wake Forest and
Elon. The Wildcat-State game shows us
about where we stand. Let’s go get Wake
Forest, Saturday!

Game with Carolina called—by all.

Game with Trinity called off.

Juniors Tie Seniors But
Bow to Freshmen

Junior-Senior

On Friday afternoon preceeding Junior
Speaking the Junior and Senior football
teams fought to a 6-6 tie. The Juniors doped
to win easily were let down with a crash
when Buchanan picked up a fumble and
ran 68 yards for a touchdown. The Maroon
and Gold realizing what they were up against
managed to shove over a touchdown in the
third quarter, tieing the score 6-6.

Young kicked off to the ten yard line to
Buchanan who returned 12, Eurrie then
punted 30 yards out of bounds. On the
second play Beaver fumbled the ball, and
Buchanan made his sensational run of 68
yards for a touchdown.

Young kicked Off to Roberts who re-
turned ten, the Seniors once more punted
on the first play, and the Juniors starting
on their thirty yard line marched steadily up
the field to the ten yard line where they
lost the ball on a fumble. Playing a de-
fensive game, Currie punted 50 yards to
Smith who was downed in his tracks. The
Juniors started another march up the field,
which carried them deep into the Senior's
territory only to have time for the first half
called on them when they were inside the
Seniors’ twentyfive yard: line.

In the second half the Seniors kicked off
to the Juniors who once more came up the
field in steady drives with Price R. and Fen-
ton carrying the ball. Several passes net-
ted them a great deal of yardage but an-
other fumble gave the Seniors the ball.
Moore fumbled and the Juniors recovered.
Price R. on the third play slipped off tackle
and dodging two men ran 29 yards for his
team’s only touchdown.

In ‘the last quarter both teams fought
hard, but neither was able to give the ball
the necessary punch to untie the score. The
Juniors carried the ball to the Senior 9
yard line, but Mauze intercepted a pass on
his own 7 yard line and the game ended.

Junior-Fresh Game

The Saturday morning of Junior Speak-
ing was the time of the last game of the
class series, in which the Freshmen defeated
the Juniors 18-0 in a game marred by many
injuries and fumbles.

The Fresh received the kickoff and ad-
vanced to the Junior 15 yard line, where the
Juniors held and the ball went over. Lind-
amood blocked an attempted punt, the ball

tolled to the 3 yard line where Baker fell
on it The next play Williams carried the
ball over. The Fresh received the kick-off |
again and advanced the ball down the po
but lost it on a fumble. Young, captain of
the Junior team, was forced from the game |
with a broken collar bone. |
During the second quarter the Fresh |
marched down the field with Jones and Mc- |
Millian carrying the ball, Standing on the
30 yard line Williams tossed a 25-yard pass |
to McMillian who crossed the line for the |
second Fresh touchdown. |
At the beginning of the second half the
Fresh started their march again with Jones |
and MeMillian |starring. William shot a}
pass to Miller which gained 30 yards and)
put the ball in scoring distance. The Jun- |
iors held for three downs, but a short pass
to Baker netted the Fresh their last touch- |
down, making the score 18-0 in the Fresh’s
favor, |
The last quarter was marked by the de- |
termined fight of the badly crippled Junior |
team. Fenton on a 25 yard run around the |
Freshman right end had his knee hurt and
was forced from the game. In spite of the
fight put up by the Juniors the ball was
shoved far into their territory, and only
the end of the game saved them from an-
other score.
Lineup unavailable.

three second places copped by him in the |
pole vault, broad jump and high hurdles. |
Streibeck is good for a number of points
against most any old team.

In the weight events Lindamood, notwith-
standing the fact that his arm was in a bad
condition on account of a boil on the wrist,
placed first in the discus throw and second
in the shot-put, helping considerably in Da-
vidson’s victory.

The mile run furnished one of the most!
exciting events of the meet. Spec McCon-!
nell of Davidson lead the race until the last |
few yards when Parsons of Carolina nosed |
him out in the sprint to the tape, winning)
by a few inches. ¢ j

In the half mile run Galloway, Davidson
captain, pulled up from third place to first,
in the last quarter lap. «DeLorme, of South
Carolina, one time Davidsonian, finished a}
close second. The race between these two!
was well staged as they ran about even|
until the last hundred yards, when Gallo-
way forged ahead and broke the tape only |
a few yards ahead. |

South Carolina’s best performers were!
Wallace, Poole, Parsons and Prevost. Wal-
lace won first place in both dashes and Poole
pulled down a first in the pole vault, broad
jump and two-twenty low hurdles. Poole
stands as high man for the meet in individ-
ual scoring with 15 points to his credit.

Parsons ran a pretty race in the mile run
and deserves special mention for his fight-
to finish first against McConnell of David-
son, who set a fast pace from the start.
Prevost, in the two-mile run, was in good
form and takes the cake for his fast finish
of this long race.

Dick contributed six points to Davidson’s
57 2-3, placing second in the two-twenty low
hurdles and the four-forty yard run. Davis
placing third in the four-forty, would have

er. He finished a close third, going strong.

Everything went off in good style for the
first meet of the season, and with t week
before the next meet, in which to correct
mistakes, Davidson should be in good shape
for N. C. State next Saturday.

The event and results are as follows:

Having barely nosed out the University
of South Carolina in a closely contested
meet at Columbia last Thursday Davidson’s
track team, under Coach Gray’s able in-

| struction is hard at work on Sprunt Field,

smoothing over the rough spots and prepar-
ing .themselves for the meet with N. C.
State this Saturday.

Davidson’s meet with State has been an
annual attraction for the past several sea-
sons, with first one and then the other hold-

| ing precedence on the track. Dope as to

| how the two teams stack up this season puts
them about even, with Davidson possibly
| holding a slight advantage. Last year State
| managed to out-point Davidson considerably
jand the year before rain ruined Davidson's
|good chance to out-class State. The sting
|of last year’s defeat together with encour-

agement in the form of victory in the first
meet of the season, puts the Davidson cinder
packers in the right attitude to win and at
least, State seems to be in for a close call
next Saturday.

State, so far this year, has had only one
meet, but in that they trounced Trinity to
the tune of 93 to 33, with good results in
most events. If comparative dope can be
considered worth while, however, David-
son is showing best form for early season
in that records made in the opening meet of
the season, which compare favorably with
State’s accomplishments so far, were made
in a drizzling rain. Stats appears to be
weakest in the field events, while Davidson
has shown best results in this department.
It looks as though the outcome of the meet
depends, on one or two second places.

Davidson’s track team is already off to
a good start on the 1923 season. Hopes are
high that Coach Gray's cohorts will bring
home the bacon next Saturday. After the
meet with State, there remains a dual meet
with Clemson, a pending triangular meet
with Elon and Guilford, and the State meet,
which closes the season. Davidson's knights
of the B. V. D.’s, with the student body back
of them, look good for a gala year.

WALTHALL CHOSEN TO
HEAD REPORTERS’ CLUB

Walthall, Wharton and Patton will di-
rect the activities of the Reporter’s Club
for the next year.

These men were elected last Friday
night. As president, Walthall will be
largely responsible for the success or fail-
ure of the club as an organization. With
Benton, Wharton and Jim Patton to help
him as vice-president and secratery-treasur-
er his task will not be so difficult.

All of these men have shown their inter-
est in the club and in Davidsonian work and
the prospects seem bright for a good year.
This week new members of the club are
to be elected and in a short time the new
officers will be installed and the new men
initiated.
