Rabin’s assasination, Israeli consul

Eitan Surkis-Almog speaks with students

about the Oslo II accord, the implications of a

Likud Party victory, and American perceptions of Israel.

Sometime this week...

What were some of the
strengths and weaknesses from
the original Declaration of
Principles in 1993 and what
kind of efforts were made to
build upon those in the recent
addition in the 1995 Oslo II
accord? In other words, what
strengths were reinforced and
what weaknesses have been
remedied in subsequent nego-
tiations?

As you know, before 1993
we did not have any formal
relations with the PLO. The
PLO was a terrorist organiza-
tion that had declared that one
of its objectives was the de-
struction of Israel, and, of
course, we would not recognize
such an organization. But, with
the secret negotiations between
Israelis and the PLO leading up
to the Declaration of Principles
in September 1993, this pro-

cess opened the way for mutual .

recognition.

At this time, Chairman
Arafat sent letters to President
Rabin denouncing terrorism and
his hope to live in peace and
security with Israel. In return,
Rabin sent a letter back recog-
nizing the PLO as the represen-
tative of the Palestinians. The
next step was a general set of
principles called the Declara-
tion of Principles. This agree-
ment called for the gradual
transfer of power and authority
to Palestinian hands. They set
the time period for five years in
which the Palestinians would
achieve this authority and con-
trol of their daily life.

Now, the implementation
of these principles were begun
with the Cairo Agreement in
May 1994 in which all these
general principles where
worked out very carefully. In
this agreement also ‘known as
the Gaza-Jericho Agreement,
Palestinians gained control of
the Gaza Strip and the small
village of Jericho in the West
Bank. The importance of Jeri-
cho was probably more sym-
bolic for Arafat to demonstrate
that he had not abandoned the

West Bank. A month ago the -

second part of the agreement
was finally signed: about the
rest of the West Bank.

I would say the most sig-
nificant point we had to over-
come with the peace process
was the increased terrorism
from the opposition. I refer

specifically to the terrorism of
Islamic Jihad and Hamas and
other extremist organizations.
These forces were opposed to
the notion that the Palestinians
would end their struggle against
Israel. In other words, this con-
flict is not over until they de-
stroy the state of Israel.

One of the good points is
that the PLO has stopped the
use of terrorism. The major
claim of the Israelis leading up
to the Cairo Agreement was
that the PLO should crack down
much harder on the Hamas and
Islamic Jihad because it was
really unbearable and it reduces

‘the amount of support for the

peace process inside Israel be-
cause the population becomes
skeptical and concerned. The
reason is that by killing Israelis
they can kill. the peace process,
and this is one of the major
weaknesses since May 1994.
We believe in the last couple
months the Palestinian Author-
ity has realized the problem and
has begun to crack down much
harder.

The last agreement signed
in September 1995 was very
complicated because there are
much more Israeli citizens liv-
ing in the West Bank, around
130,000, while in the Gaza Strip

CULTURAL CONVOY

Israeli Consul Eitan Surkis-Almog.

Mr. Eitan Surkis-Almog was born
in Haifa, Israel in 1961. He joined
the Israeli Ministry of Foreign

Affairs in 1986 and some:of his
subsequent post have included the
Jordan-PLO desk and as First Sec-

retary of the Israeli Embassy in
Peru. He currently represents the
Israeli consulate in Atlanta.

U.S. should realize that improv-

_ing the economic situation there

will keep the peace.

As muchas it would cost, it
would still cost less than a war.
When you give aid, you give
people hope, and where there is
hope, people will go for peace.
Just vestaraey, there was a huge

we know is that the Likud party
leader has declared that he
would keep the agreement as
long as the Palestinians kept
their side. I believe any govern-
ment in Israel would act ac-
cording to the commitments of
the previous government. We
are sure that the peace process

economies of the Middle East
including Israel, and this is one
of the benefits of the peace pro-
cess.

This is more on a personal
level, but how would you like
Americans to see Israel? What
would be your message to
American youth as far as Is-
rael:is cor-

and excellent culture.

nered?

That is a good
question. I wish
we arrived at a

there are only about 5,000 Is-
raeli citizens. The security ar-
rangements were complicated
which made the whole agree-
ment complicated but without
this security for Israelis living
inside the Gaza Strip and West
Bank the whole agreement
might have collapsed.

Of course, all these agree-
ments are interim arrangements.
In next year we start the nego-
tiations for the final settlement.

What do you see as the
U.S. rolein implementing these
agreements?

We think the U‘S. role is
really important and always has
been. It must be understood in
the Middle East that everyone
who chooses peace must be re-
warded for that. The reward
could be economic — more in-
frastructure and jobs, for ex-

ample. The whole international .

community which is led by the

economic summit in. Amman,
the capital of Jordan. Both Is-
rael and Arab countries were
there, and one of the major de-
velopments was to establish a
regional bank for development.

I cannot emphasize enough
the importance of improved eco-
nomic conditions not only for
the welfare of people but con-
tinuing the peace.

There is atremendous deal
of speculation of what the im-
plications of a Likud Party vic-
tory in the upcoming elections
in Israel next year would mean
in both the domestic and re-
gional dimensions. Could you
comment on this?

It is very hard to answer
that question because the elec-
tions are one year from now and
anything could happen. What

with Palestinians is irreversible,
so we have chosen one path and
we should be on the right track.

What is the Israeli govern-
ment trying to do in order. to
promote the peace agreement
among Israelis?

The promotion of the peace
process would mean the-stop-
ping of the terrorist activities.
The major threat to the support
of the Israelis to the peace pro-
cess is the terrorism. On the
other hand, we know the ben-
efits, and some people do not
see the benefits of the peace
process right away. It is much
more immediate and threaten-
ing for an Israeli to hear about a
bus being attacked for example.

It is not hard to see the
benefits of the Amman Confer-
ence which would develop the

day when we
did not have to
talk so much about war and
violence. I hope next time that
I would come here we would be
able to talk about how peace is
going between Israel and Syria,
for example. Just like now we
can talk about how peace is
going on between Israel and
Jordan.

But more than that, I hope
we come to the time in which
we forget that we had so many
conflicts and wars between Is-

‘rael and Arabs. If I come here,

you would ask me to say how
life is in Israel and Israeli soci-
ety? How is the Israeli culture,
for example? We want Ameri-
cans to know that Israel is a
normal society with culture,
good food, and other things.
We want to expose more of this
exciting and excellent culture.
