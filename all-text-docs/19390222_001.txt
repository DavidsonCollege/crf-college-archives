There has been a movement late-

campus. Interest in this particular
type of music is growing and has
grown much in the past few years.

Phi Hall is an especially appro-

the the audience may become more
intimately associated with the musi-
cal performance.

Rumor Is Denied

College authorities emphatically
denied a prevailing rumor that any
further change is to be made in the
Davidson coaching staff.

A short time ago Parks Harrison,
wrestling coach, resigned from the
staff and a rumor has been preval-
ent around the campus that another
member of the coaching staff was
planning to leave at the end of the
semester. This is absolutely ‘false as
no other changes are to be made.
