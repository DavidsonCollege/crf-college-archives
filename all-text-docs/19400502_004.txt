using a good many men just
up for the varsity, and—the
petiormance that they have
made shows that we are going
to be well represented on the

diamond in future years.

SOFTBALL CRAZE

Soft ball seems to have
taken the campus by storm
of late, and the interfratern-
ity race has become very
heated with three fraterni-
ties having been defeated
once apiece. The Kappa Sigs _
beat the Phi Gams 9-8 in a
thriller, scoring the winning
run in the last half of the
seventh inning. Then the Fi-
jis shut out the Phi Delts
2-0 with Jay “Bolin turning
in four hit ball. In the first
game of the season the off-
and-on Pika ten cut the K
Sigs, only to have them come
back and win every game
since.

full strength. We have to doff
our caps to Captain R, O. for
coming through with 10 points,
not in one, but in every meet.

Congratulations, Bob!

Let’s all hope that the
baseball team doesn’t take
any more extended trips.
