DAVIDSON IVINS FIRST GAME

Defeats Catawba College by Stor?
of 8-1.

Davidson. started off the base ball
season Monday, March 23rd, by defeat-
ing the boys from Catawba. Although
outhit, Davidson showed superior work
in the field and on the bases, and at no
time was the outcome in doubt. David-
soon took the lead in the second by piling
up seven runs, and after this it was
merely a.matter of finishing the nine

‘}innings. ‘There was just one outstand-

ing feature of the game. and that was
the poor fielding of the visitors. It
looked as if it was impossible for them
to hold the ball.

From a Davidson standpoint the
the game was all that one could expect
except for the’ poor hitting, and this ix
sure to ‘improve in the'‘next few davs
as soon-.as the men have more practice
against curve balls. The team fielded
in almost perfect style, only one bobble
occuring during:the game, and this came
at a time when no harm could be donc.

‘Osteen and Currie showed up in mid-

season style.

|. Panella had a little hard luck at first,

but managed to pull himself out of a
deep: hole in the eighth in such a way
that he showed that he could deliver
the goods.
The score by innings was as follows:
123456789—r.he.

OAK RIDGE WINS IN 11TH,

On Thursday it was doubtful wheth-

-}er the game would be played or not on

account of the rain, but the sun: coming
out, the game began on time. Davidson
However, Davidson should have
won the game several times before the
nine innings were up. The men were

‘daring upon the bases, and took some
chances that nine out of ten times would

have been sure, but as it happened. Dav-

‘idson- got-that tenth time in each case.

But the players and the team that take
chances on the bases instead of sleeping,
Dav-
idson can expect great things in the
coming games. ~ ‘

“Bill” pitched one-of. the best games
that has ever been twirled on the hill.

‘Tust think! he would have had a no-hit

game to his credit—‘‘if. the wind had
only blown the other way.” He held

them at his mercy up to the eleventh in-

ning, when. a wild peg dashed from his

In the first inning Oak Ridge was

back to the bench on three strikes which
he was unable to solve. Adackey ground-
ed to Pete, and Hook dittoed in like
manner, second to tirst. For the Elec-
trics our chances for piling up a few
scores looked prosperous when Christen-
bury walked, Keesler bunted, and the
pitcher endeavoring to catch the bunt,
stumped his toe, and knocked the bail
out of the diamond. Christenbury saw
that third was desolate of a player, so he
made a daring ettort to purloin it. The
ground being wet and heavy made speed
difficult, and “Shorty”? who picked up
the ball, tagged him out in a very close
decision. Stough came up with his
teeth gritted and smashed one for a sin-
gle. Keesler stopped at third, when the
ball was turned in and endeavored to
score when the pitcher whipped the
ball to second to catch. Stouch, . Two
perfect pegs were made and he was out.
Crayton made the third out. Davidson
had several other chances to.score. In. the
eleventh, ‘Britton, for Oak , Ridge, got
a. texas over first, Bland sacrificed him
down... Upchurch hit to, left and Kees-
ler made a wild throw to third and
Britton scored. . Hook next drove one
to center and scored Upchurch. — Haist-
ed made third out. Davidson came in

DAVIDSON FEDERALS.

The National Federal League has
caused to spring into existence one of
similar nature here within our own
midst. Composing this ‘ most distin-

guished and celebrated nine there are

those—with. reference to the Varsity—
who would if they could, and others
who could if they would. To this latter
class belong such “ringers” of many a
professional contest as Woods, Marsh,
McDonald and Bradfield. Under the
very efficient management of Choate,
and inspiring leadership of Capt. Woods
a most formidable aggregation has been
woven together. A

On the 23rd they took an extensive
tour to the city of Huntersville and
there walloped that strong team to the
tune of 22 to 2. The outlaws plaved
unusually fine ball to have been together
for such a short time. The features
were the superb pitching of James, the
field work of McDonald: and Woods.
and the all around hitting of the entirz

team.
Federal line-up: Marsh, |. f.; Dulin.
c. f.: Tames, p.; McKinnon, 2b; Woods,

3b; McDonald, s.s.; Choate, 1 b; Elliott,

retired in quick order. Upchurch went|c.; Bradfield, r. f.

DATIDSON 18. TERRELL 0.

The game last Saturday with Red
Whitner's “Gingeress” was a farcial af-
fair. It was a free for all merry-go-
round game, and the final score’was 18
to.9. The country lads could certainly
hit the pill, and landed on the second
squad pitchers, W. Joel Smith, Shaw,
and MeNair for quite a few bingles.

“LIVE WIRE” DOPE.

Plenty Pep is the word, every one be
a booster, everybody behind the team,
then Davidson is bound to win.

Rill certainly pitched some ball last
Thursday, and they were breaking beau-
tifully. Never mind, that kind of slab
work is sure to win nine times out of
ten. .

Christenbury beat out several infield
balls last week in big league stvle.

In practice last week ‘Slim’ Glover
pilfered second in Tv Cobb fashion.

That pep in ‘the eleventh inning was
great. But next time what about start-
ing it a little earlier. “By the way,
“Bugs” Robinson, one. of the assistant
cheer leaders, did not come back after
Xmas. Why not elect another at once,
and also another extra, so that there will
be enough to lead the pep.

Guilford today, everybody be out!

Batting and fielding averages will be
started in the next Davidsonian.

If Catawba lost did Bill Winn?

The students are glad to see Cal. Skit
out at all of the games.

The Davidson Feds will have several
eames during the coming week, so says
the manager.

Coach Cook requests that every one
keep away from the players benches dur-
ing the game.

Six more big games on the Hill. If
you have any friends in nearby towns,
send them a schedule and invite them
over.

“Long Boy” Johnson stepped over 5
feet 11;inches on Thursday afternoon,

‘|-and-on Saturdav he cleared § feet 11

inches by a good inch. If he keeps on he
will: go ‘over the moon soon.
“Gilchrist is in great. form, and we
look for him to smash to pieces some
track records on the cinder path during
the coming ‘month.

The University of South Carolina is
coming up for a meet on the 4th of
April, and they have a strong track
team.

The University of North Carolina
foot ball squad will train next August
at Lake Kanuga. near Hendersonville.

Box score of Varsity games will be
started in next issue.

QUEENS COLLEGE GLEE CLUB
CONCERT.

The concert given Monday night. the
23rd, by the Queens College Glee Club,
of nineteen voices, was one of the finest
concerts given here this vear. The audi-
ence was unusually appreciative and the
applause elicited by the allusion to “a
little Davidson student” could hardly
be surpassed. Miss Smith’s violin play-
ing, too, was excellent.

After the concert a reception was
given the performers by the Y. M. C.
A. Cabinet and the Orchestra and Glee
Club. ©Mrs.. Martin, Mrs. Arbuckle,
Mrs. Currie and Miss Shaw received.
The. reading’ room was used. as usual,:
and presented a scene unusual for Dav-
idson. receptions. as there were no more
men. than ladies present.

STAG DANCE ENJOYABLF
EVENT. :

An enjoyable event of the week break-
ing the monotony of routine work was
the stag dance given in the Commence-
ment Hall last Saturdav evening by the
German Club. Music was furnished bv
Monsieur Morrison’s. select trio of
musicians. There will be another dance
next Saturday night at
which everyone is invited. Admission,
