GOVERNMENT INSURANCE.

We believe that it is not only the
privilege, but also the duty of everyone
in military service to take all the Gov-
ernment Insurance that the law will al-
low. We are making a study of this
feature with a view -fo answering any
question that may arise in your mind.
Many of you will soon be drafted. Now
is the time to find out what this insur-
ance is. What we do not know about
its salient features we can soon find out.
It will be considered a privilege to dis-
cuss this matter with you. Ask

THE EDITOR.

OBJECTS FOR HIPPOCRATES

The week-end registrants in the new-
ly recruited space in Mrs. Robson's Hos-
pital were: M. R. Watt. H. C. Ham-
ilton and R. H. Stone. This trio are
Knights of LaGrippe. Those who have
something that no one else will have are
put down-stairs.

Those registered up-stairs with the
mumps (Mrs. Robson's definition: “A
solid mass of misery’) were R. R. Deav-
er, Jr. and S. J. Hooker, whose jaws
they say are quite distended (and the
Infirmary reporter is willing to take
heresay).

Tf at any time the gentlemen of leisure
of the campus want to spend the weck-
end off the Hill at a delightful resort,
the Infirmary is recommended. Mrs.
Robson gives one perfectly fine attention
—so gentle, and thoughtful. It is all
delightful, not speaking of the only dis-
agreeable thing—the drug store product,
and this isn’t so bad, for with a medi-
cated form of Na O2 you get grepe juice
which would make the gods of ancient
Greece contemn their nectar and am-
brosia for a sip. The menu widely
varies and is appetizing. A typical
lunch is: the best tomato soup you ever
tasted, rice, mashed potatoes, crackers,
toast, spoon bread, and apricot cream
that would make anyone wish they were
here. Who's next?

The DAVIDSONIAN, February 13, 1918

DRILL NEWS OF THE
DAVIDSON BATTALION

The Davidson Battalion has made
very good progress since it has been or-
ganized, considering the bad weather
and a number of cases of sickness among
the members of the student body. The
companies are drilled on Sprunt Field
every afternoon during the week except
Monday. Advance work in maneuvers
has heen taken up and will be continued
thruout the spring.

A very impressive ceremony was be-
gun on Saturday afternoon, when all
three companies assembled around the
foot of the flagpole and stood retreat.
This ceremony will be held each after-
noon at the close of drill. A non-com-
missioned officer and two privates com-
pose the color guard, and the flag is low-
ered at the last note of retreat. While
it is being lowered all officers and men
in uniforms without arms stand at
salute, men with arms at present arms,
and citizens at attention with their hats
in their right hands, placed over ther
hearts.

The commandant announced recently
the appointment of Licut. J. A. Thames
to be captain. in command of Company
B. He will perform the duties con-
nected with this office in addition to his
duties as battalion adjutant.

C.K. MEPRTING.

The subject of the Christian En-
deavor meeting last Sunday night was,
“Our Church end What It Stands For.”
C. J. Matthews, the leader, gave a sum-
mary of the Presbyterian beliefs. In
the general discussion J. W. Clark em-
phasized the fact that although — the
church as a whole used in olden times to
be repressive in its doctrine or command-
ed what not to do, now it is active and
alse points out what to do. [rt was urged
that more take oart in the meetings as
a general discussion was of bereft to all.
The meeting was dismisse | after repeat-
ing the regular benediction.
