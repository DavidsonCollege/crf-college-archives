Social Council Plans
Buffets, Combo Parties

Campus Social Council,
proposed by the recent fac-
ulty fraternity ruling, is
presently planning next
fall’s social functions.

The goal of this organization
is to provide a new concept of
social unity on campus and to
meet the needs of fraternity
men, Independents, and incom-
ing freshmen, according to
Chairman Dan Campbell.

The council will probably be
elected by the student body in
the future, but next year’s coun-
cil was appointed. Its members
in addition to Campbell are,
Rocky Walker, vice-chairman:
Irvine Welling; treasurer; Mike
Booe, corresponding secretary:
Pinckney Whitson, recording
secretary: and Joe Davis, Vince
Foster, Jim Terry, Bill Ken-
drick, Tom Scott, John Fagg, B.
A. Aiken, Bill Aitken and David
Jennings.

Two incoming freshmen will
be appointed next fall. Seven of
these members were selected by
the IFC: Campbell, Welling and

In an effort to create a better
and more organized campus so-
cial atmosphere next fall, the
council plans to have buffets at
the Union following all home
football games, according to
Campbell. The buffets will be
followed by combo parties in
Chambers Building, the Union,
or outdoors. |

There will also be the two
concert weekends and Home-
coming Weekend during first
semester, plus two‘ concert
weekends and two dance week-
ends during second semester.
Five combos, the Medallions,
Enchanters, Monzas, Embers

and the Fabulous Five, have
been booked for a total of eight
appearances first semetser.
Next year's social fee will be
used by the council to finance
the standard functions, Camp-

bell said, and it is hoped that -

the remainder of the social fund
can be used by the council to
implement new programs, pro-
mote more realistic and closer
student-faculty social relations,
enhance existing activities, and
co-ordinate with the College
Union.

Campbell said of the Social
Council, “It’s all new,
formulated. Both student sup-
port and student suggestions
will be the key to its success.

TO SOCIAL COUNCIL POSITIONS

Council Appoints Independents

By FRANK FLEMING
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Student Council has
elected three students to
represent the Independents
on the newly-organized So-
ical Council.

Bill Aitken, B. A. Aiken, and
David Jennings will represent
the rising senior, junior and
sophomore classes, respectively.

Although John Fagg, Lee Fan-
ning. Billy Clark, and David
Walker were absent from the
Tuesday meeting. President
Bill Council proceeded to ap-
point the following members to
serve on various standing com-
mittees:

David Meschan, Randy Mc-
Knight, Financial: Chuck Mat-
thews, Magazine Advisory
Board: John Thomas, Academic
Scheduling: Jim Timmons, Stu-
dent Activities, and Paul Mar-
ion, Non academic Scheduling.
Council concluded by confirming
Thomas’ earlier appointment to
the Traffic Committee.

In major business the council
received a petition to make on-
anism an offense under the stu-
dent body ‘regulations. Council
read aloud the petition before
the council members and sev-
eral visitors. Since the council
declined to discuss this docu-
ment, the visitors (three of the
56 who had signed it) soon left.

Rush Regulations

Feature Open Parties

The Interfraternity Council met
Monday. night to expand and
clarify the recent ruling by the
Trustees on the fraternity situa-
tion. Rules governing rush for
next year were approved, stated
IFC President Jim Terry.

According to the new rules, no
rush letters or parties will be
permitted during the summer.
There will be no formal rush
until Oct. 30. when there will be
open parties at all fraternity
houses.

All members of the student
body will be invited to come to
these afternoon parties and will
be encouraged to visit as many
houses as each wishes.

There will be two similar par-
ties on Nov. 6 and Nov. 13.

Invitations will be sent out to
the remaining two parties on
Dec. 4 and 11. Those receiving
invitations will be permitted to
visit three houses on each of
these afternoons.

Bids will be mailed during the
first three days of the Christ-
mas holidays and must. be re-
turned before schools resumes.
Rushees failing to confirm their
bids will not be allowed to
pledge any fraternity until the
end of February. Formal pledg-
ing will take place during the
first week of the second semes-
ter.

Contact between fraternity
members and freshmen is pro-
hibited after 7:30 p.m. in dorms,
fraternity houses, and off-cam-

pus. Also, there will be no con-
tact after these rush parties un-
til the following Monday morn.
ing,

Greek Week will be held from
March 24 until April 6. However,
no date will be set for initiation;
each fraternity may set its own
date.

IFC dues will be $7 for fra-
ternity members and $3 for
pledges. The IFC also voted to
accept representatives from eat-
ing clubs petitioning for mem-
bership.

Rules applying to fraternities
will also apply to eating clubs.
Any rushee who commits him-
self to a boarding house must
keep this committment until the
end of the year.

However at the end of the
meeting Bob Bryan re opened
the subject by calling the peti-
tion ‘‘an effort to make hock out
of student government proces-
ses." Will Jackson labeled it a
“crude joke on the constitu-
tion.” David Powell advised,
“There's no sense in taking it
seriously. They're just trying to
set the council up as a bunch of
stuffed shirts.”

Council explained that the on-
anism petition would be read
along with the Powell petition in
chape! Thursday: both petitions
will then be voted on in next
Tuesday's referendum.

Before the meeting officially
convened, council members saw
a 15-minute film on the Moral
Re-Armament movement. Mal-
colm Roberts, a °58 graduate of
Princeton, explained the pur-
poses and history of his organi-
zation and encouraged student
attendance at the Moral Re-
Armament ‘Mackinac Demon-
stration’ this summer,

This assembly in Mackinac
Island, Mich., will include youth

from Africa, Asia, and Europe
—all dedicated to ‘ending dicta- ;
torship, moral pacifism, and so-
cial violence.” In answering
student questions. Roberts call-
ed the movement ‘‘revolution- :
ary, yet not anti-Communistic.”’

Since the cost of attending one
of the 3-week sessions is $200,
the council discussed the possi-
bility of financing a delegate.
After Ben Cannon reported a
balance of almost $200, Fred
Sackett suggested, ‘Since we
have a regional National Stu-
dent Association officer (Arnie
Goodstein), we ought to use this

-excesS money to send him to

the nation-wide NSA _ conven-
tion."” The consensus of the
council seemed in accord with
Sackett, but no action was tak-
en.

Before adjourning, Council ap- |
pointed Meschan as a commit- |
tee-of one to investigate recent
complaint about laundry: irreg-
ularities. As a final measure,
council unanimously approved
Powell's motion of appreciation
to its three senior advisors,
Jackson, Sackett. and Walker.

representative who ptesented
the petition, told the council, “I
don’t think this rule (drinking
rule) should be held over our
heads."

He said he wanted the rule to
be changed as soon as possible,
and called on the council ‘‘to
devote attention now to some-
thing we can carry out this
year."

Will Jackson said he believed
it would be better to postpone
the referendum until next fall.
He emphasized the importance
of the Student Council poll on
drinking. ‘“‘We must find out,"’
he commented, “‘what the group
we're representing wants,"

“I don't think the petition
should be presented right now,”'
he continued. ‘Next fall there
will be a better chance of ac-
complishing what you want.”

Fred Sackett agreed with
Jackson, but Joe Davis, Honor
Court member who attended the
meeting, said, “If the council
doesn't allow the petition to go
before the students, then it's
making a mistake.”

The problem of confusion of

{the referendum and polls and

the question of whether or not
the referendum will be the final
action in the drinking controver-
sy was discussed at some
length.

Balloting will be conducted on
Tuesday, which is the pre-exam
reading day, in the lobby of
Chambers from 9 a.m.-12 noon
and 1:30-4:30 p.m.

" DR. WILL HERBERG
Says “Life Is A Venture”:

By TED GLUSMAN
Davidsonian Feature Writer
He looked like Sabastian

Cabot. But the instant he
uttered a word, with his
forceful voice and definite
Jewish accent, that possi-
bility was dispelled.

Instead, he was Will Herberg,
this year’s last Reynolds lectur-
er, with a doctorate in some-
thing called Social Philosophy
and the title Professor of Cul-
ture from Drew University in
New Jersey. “They invented
that title."” he quipped, ‘‘be-
cause it includes everything."
During his two days at David-
son, he exhibited one part an-
thropologist, three parts philo-
sopher, and two parts theolog-
jan.

Known as author of Protest-
ant, Catholic, Jew, Herberg was

in for sociolological questioning
during his first few minutes on
campus by a group of interested
students. Among his many com-
ments was that the South is the
only true section of the country
with an identity as a section.
“The South has to exclude Tex-
as.” he added, ‘“‘which was nev-
er the South, and southern Flor-
ida, which is just a suburb of
New York!"

He proceeded ito politics,
blasting many civil rights en-
thusiasts because ‘“‘they take
something that is relative and
make it absolute. They put their
ultimate allegiance in something
political.” When asked about
Robert Kennedy, a close friend
of his, he described Kennedy as
“bright, ruthless and ambiti-
ous.” Herberg continued, ‘‘With-
out John. he will fall into the

trap of too great an ambition.’

Monday night, Herberg spoke
in Hodson Hall on ‘‘Existential-
ism: Atheistic and Religious.”
He divided existentialism into
three parts: a way of thinking
about human existence, an ana-
lysis of the human situation, and
an answer to the human predi-
cament.

He divided thinking into the
two categories of ‘‘objective’
and ‘‘existentialist,’’ which he
defined as “the thinking of the
existing subject about his ex-
istence, as he exists his exist-
ence.”

The religious existentialist
feels that “the human being, in
his transcending, meets trans-
cended reality: God."’ The athe-
ist, on the other hand. feels
that in this transcending, man
‘‘meets Nothing. Not meets not:

anything. but meets Nothing.”
Both arrive at this conclusion by
an act of faith, asserted Her-
berg.

Herberg closed with three ma-
jor drawbacks of existentialism:
it is “incurably individualistic,
unstable, and radically man-
centered.”

Tuesday in chapel, Herberg
spoke on ‘“‘The Strangeness of
Faith.” He discussed the posi-
tion that the ‘‘anti-believer” is
closer to God because ‘‘he takes
God _seriously,"’ than is the
“lukewarm, conventionally _ pi-
ous man." To the latter, stated
Herberg. God is a “great cos-
mic public utility.”

Both the firm believer and
the firm unbeliever, stated Her-
berg, ate involved with a ‘‘pos-
sion. of infinite concern.”

group that has been meeting
with the Faculty Committee on
Fraternities, Clubs and Social
Life. The three students working
with Obenshain are George
Brown, Jesse Sims and Bruce
Hyslop.
ESTIMATED COSTS

Obenshain discussed the es-
timated costs to members of an
eating club. Included in the fees
would be board, housing fee,
social assessment and probably
a small additional charge to
begin payment on furnishings
which, it is hoped would be ini-
tially taken care of by the col-
lege and paid off over a period
of years by the club’s member-
ship.

It was pointed out by Oben-
shain that all fees would be com-
parable to those of fraternities
and that the total cost for an
academic year would be around
$500. It was noted that this was
a very rough estimate.

SERIOUS THINKING

Obenshain stated that he was
‘very pleased with the turnout
at the meeting,”’ and he said
that ‘‘the important thing was
that it set people to serious
thinking about the situation.”

Dr. W. G. McGavock, chair-
man of the Faculty Committee
on Fraternities, ‘Clubs -and Sa--

‘cial Life, was present at the
meeting as were Dean of Stu-
dents R. C. Burts and Professor
George Labban, two other mem-
bers of the committee.

McGavock stated that he
thought “‘the response in the
meeting was very positive and
it shows that interest is pretty
high.”

The problem of whether to
build one or two houses was dis-
cussed and McGavock said he
didn't think “‘that there is any
question that two houses would
be more effective than one.”

DEFINITE COMMITMENT

He indicated that a letter ask-
ing for a definite commitment
on the interested students’ part
would be distributed by the
middle of next week. This letter
will be the determining factor
in whether one or two clubs are
built.

R. A. Currie, business man-
ager of the college, said that he
was “hopeful that two houses
can be finished by October 1."
He stated that President D. G.
Martin is forming a committee
to study where the houses should
be placed (probably around the
perimeter of Patterson Frater-
nity Court), and also to deter-
mine necessary architectural al-
terations .in the new- houses.
