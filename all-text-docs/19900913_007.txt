Messer found that he enjoyed the
diversity: of studies which he was
allowed within the realm of psy-
chology.

Although he finds the area of
clinical psychology fascination,
Messer feels he will remain on the
academic side of psychology rather
than taking up a practice of his
own.

and learning. It is a way I can
indulge my own selfish interests
by studying as much as I can and
then being able to combine that
with sharing my knowledge with

Reading Jane Austen and Sinking
Pints Part of Cambridge Experience

By LIZ YAREMA

Imagine hearing a lecture on
Wordsworth and then hiking in the
Lake District which inspired him;
reading about Georgian architec-
ture then touring through some of
the best examples of it; studying
Byron at the same university in
which he himself studied as a stu-
dent. The group of Davidson stu-
dents who spent six weeks this
summer participating in the Col-
lege’s Cambridge program do not
need to imagine such experiences,
they lived them.

The Cambridge program not
only gave students an opportunity,
to study and travel abroad during
the summer, it also gave the stu-
dents a chance to earn class cred-
its. In a series of lectures and

herself was Associate Professor of
English Gail Gibson. Gibson
considers the program’s. three-
dimensionality to be one of its
strongest points. Through class
work, reading lists, side trips and
three-day-weekend allowances,
she felt the participants were “lit-
erally made to see” eighteenth and
nineteenth-century England.

The students gave high marks
for her knowledge concerning the
Cambridge subject matter. “She
may be a medievalist,” Senior
Martha Spoor explained, “but she
also knew everything about the
periods we were studying.” Class-
mate Darry Strickland agrecd,
commenting that Gibson’s aware-
ness of the Cambridge countryside |
contributed greatly to the experi-
ence. “She had all sorts of neat
ideas about where to go and what

enjoyed. scveral benefits of the
Davidsoncommunity.

In addition to the’ fact that
there has been no mass murderer
on the loose in Davidson (in con-
trast to the situation in his home
town of Gainesville, Florida,)
Messer has enjoyed the congenial
attitude of the area.

Another aspect of Davidson
life he enjoys is the small classes.
The undergraduate classes he
taught at Florida numbered from
55 to 125 students.

Messer did his undergraduate
work at the University of New
Hampshire, while working at sev-
eral different jobs in the areas of
carpentry and landscaping.

After taking a variety of lib-'

others. I just want to teach well
and continue to learn about psy-
chology,” said Messer.

While pursuing his degrees,
Messer took several years off. As
many Davidson students are now
struggling with the detision of
going to graduate school and are
taking the various exams required
for admittance, Messer advises
them to take time off between
undergraduate and graduate school
if a student is unsure about his or
her career decision.

Onthe other hand, he also feels
that this “time off” can be wasted.
He recommends either going
abroad or doing an internship to
help broaden a student’s knowl-
edge before plunging into gradu-
ate school.

The way everyone spent their
free time was as varied as the stu-
dents themselves. With London
not far away, many chose to fre-
quent the museums, galleries, thca-

ters and stores. While some made
pilgrimages to all the history-ma-
jor havens and English-major
shrines they could find, others trav-

Ritual and the Canine Frenzy

with the last review, The Pixies

Bossanova is getting a little better
with each listen. But those listens
are growing few and far between
due to the new Jane’s disk totally
hogging the CD tray. The band’s

third album Ritual de lo Habitual

is like Bossanova in that it follows
the band's second and best work,

Nothing's Shocking, an absolute
scorcher, full of true, hard, alterna-
tive skate rock, that is as shocking
as tonguce-testing your car battery.
And, like Bossanova, Ritual does
not live up to its predecessor. It is
not as much of a Ict down though.

Ritual opens withavery cheesy
introduction en Espajfiol, “Stop!”
It is in line with the cheesy jacket
message addressed “To the Mos-
quitoes.” “No One’s Leaving” sets

-the tone of the disc and the title is

truthful in that it’s tough to leave

the lounge chair until one has heard
all nine tracks. It also introduces
Perry Farrell’s (read Peripheral’s)
theme for the disc; inter-racial sex/
relationships. It is not as constant
or developed as the “nothing’s
shocking” theme and the disc loses
points for this. The musical and
creative zenith is “Been Caught
Stealing.” Play this funk in a
crowded apartment and the place
