A resoluion was _ passed
wh.ch granted a charter to the
Young Republican Club. Club
presiden. George Kaneklides
explained after the meeting.
“This club 1s made up mainly
of the more liberal and pro.
gressive members of the pre-
viously existing Young Repub-
licans ca campus.”

Asked for the reasons for the
split Tuesday. Kaneklides said
“At tonight's election we tried

... Terry Compiles SLC Study

(Continued from Page 1)
Terry also mentioned the lack
of a sense of belonging preva

lent among many — studen‘s.
which resuks in ‘‘privatism.
loneliness. nomcommitment.

and rootlessness.

“This student indifference de-
humanizes life and other men.”
he suggested.

Terry listed a fourth reality
as ‘‘meaninglessness and the
identity crisis. Many
even wonder if they have a fu-
ture.”

He said that ‘‘the reality of
meaninglessness has caused a
crisis of values from the neces-
Si:y to work to the purpose of
the family. Students as a whole
have more intellectual skills
than they do values.”

Finally. Terry is disturbed
by the “absence of joy and the
lack of laughter. It results in a
lack of excitement and enthus-
lasm.

“When men lose the capacity
to laugh at themselves and with
others. they have lost a great
part of their humanity.

To combat these problems.
Terry recommended — several
comprehensive goals which he
feels should be moved toward:

!' Davidson needs to provide
the kind of climate in which
students may learn. skills for
communication with other hu-
man beings and those skills
which enhance individual hu-
manization.

‘thiugh surely that would be a

nathen, we. need to produce a

Terry commented that a pii-
mary area for work with the
SLC will be the social system.
“Numerous studies have been
Inade c acerning the social sys-
tem but have never been imple-
meted.

What J hope to do with the
committee is take suggestions.

use these kinds of things to

coneluded.

»- . Governance

(Continued From Page 1)
alized structure we now have
in favor of a live and flex.ble
unity.

Colleges such as An-ioch. Prin-
ceton, and Goucher have already
instituted a form of community
governmen: which has done a
great deal to diffuse the fac-
iwnaiism that previously existed
on these campuses.

This seems to be the only sane
approach to Davidson's govern
anee dilemma. tn changing to
Such a Structure no group would
lose out. in fact all would gain.

Davidson. is a very unhappy

place now; something needs to
be done to revive it from its
lethargic state. A change in
governance might go a long way
toward raising academic stan-
dards and achieving the goals
of the college.

Al Us pomt it is clear our
present governance system is
haphazard. and inefficient. We
must reiect a governance sys-
tem that embraces only the pri-
vileged favor of one in which
‘unity, harmony and concensus
preside.

Tne College Assembly seems
to be the best answer.
