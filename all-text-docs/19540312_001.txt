Conference Examines
Car Parking Problems

The Davidson College Student-
Faculty Conference Committee
met last Friday, March 5, 1954,
with its chairman, Dr. J. H. Ost-
walt, presiding.

The committee, whose main pur-
pose is to work out college prob-
lems through student-faculty co-
operation, asked Mr. D. Grier Mar-
tin to meet with them tu discuss
the student parking situation.

It was suggested that the lot be-
tween the rear of the President's
home and the new dormitory be
turned into a parking lot for stu-
dents.

However, Mr. Martin said that
his job was to apply the funds of
the school to the best advantage
of the entire student body and
he did not feel that building a new
parking lot there, which along
with its great expense would only
be temporary until the new dormi-
tory is completed, would be put-
tings the funds to their best use.
He said that some additional park-
ing spaces near the new dormitory

Beaver Club Drive
To Begin March 12

The annual spring clothing drive,
sponsored by the Beaver club, will
be conducted this year from
Friday, March 12, through Sunday,
March 28.

Every year the Beaver Club
chooses the people of some foreign
nation or nations to whom they
will send all wearing apparel col-
lected in the spring drive; and
this year the clothing will be dis-
tributed by the Church World
Service Center at New Windsor,
Maryland. In the past, these drives
have been very successful, and the
Beaver Club expresses its hope
that this year’s drive will be the
biggest yet.

This year a new method of col-
lection will be used, with one room
on each floor of every dormitory
as a center for the collection of
clothes on that hall. These rooms
will be designated by a large red
sign on their doors.

Concerning what students are
expected to give, any type of wear-
ing apparel in useable condition
will be a help, especially any shoes
which may be old but not worn
out.

All contributions to this im-
portant drive will be appreciated
by the Beaver Club, and the cloth-
ing will undoubtedly be appre-
ciated by the people of the foreign
country to whom it is sent as a
good-will gift from the people
the United States.

pletion.

Mr. Martin told the committee
that he would look into the possi-
bility of providing some student
parking at Shearer Hal] and
around the laundry. He also an-

Blood For Polio, Vets
Needed In April’s Drive

By JOHN HIERS

The return of the Red Cross
bloodmobile to the campus April
Ist and 2nd will bring to the David-
son student body another oppor-
tunity to demonstrate their support
of the worthy aims of the blood
drives. Those in charge of the
spring drive are counting on the
student body to respond again, as
they have in the past, and to main-
tain Davidson’s excellent record.
Unselfish gestures such as donat-
ing blood do much to dispel the
opinion held by some older per-
sons that we are a thoughtless gen-
eration, unmindful of the needs of
our fellow men.

Blood is needed. particularly at
this time for the veterans’ hos-
pitals all over the country. It
should be remembered that al-

in Korea, there are still thousands

America’s Native Peet-Biographer,
Carl Sandburg, Appears March 31

By J. T. HARMON

Carl Sandburg, who will appear
at Davidson College at 8:16 p.m.
on Wednesday, March 31, is known
as America’s “most truly native

joet.””

P Born of Swedish stock in Gales-
burg, Dlinois, his early schooling
was haphazard, and at thirteen he
went to work on a milk wagon.

For the next six years he was,
in rapid succession, porter in a
barber shop, scene-shifter in a
cheap theater, truck-handler in a
brickyard, turner apprentice in a
pottery, dish-washer in Denver and
Omaha hotels and harvest hand in
Kansas wheatfields.

After serving .in the Spanish
American War, he started out in
the newspaper world, and soon be-
gan to write poetry. His first poems
went unnoticed. “Chicago,” how-
ever, won the prize for the best
poetry entered in Poetry magazine.
Gradual recognition resulted in
Sandburg’s winning the Pulitzer
Prize in 1013 for his “Corn-
huskers.”

While on the staff of the Chicage
Daily News he developed his writ-
ing, most of which dealt with the
common man and his problems.
His exaltation of the working man
caused him to be known as the
“poet of Industrial America.”

in addition to his reputation as
a writer of poetry, Sandburg is
known also for his books for chil-

r

mental biography of Abraham, everywhere, is sure to be rich in
Lincoln. “The War Years,” part] songs, stories, poems, and tall tales
of the six volume series, won the| of this great American author.
Pulitzer Prize in 1939. Students will he admitted to the

They | quire blood transfusions. Many of

these men are having successive
operations in order to regain their
health and their place in the com-
munity. They merit our support
now just as much as when they
were on the battlefield. The need
that was met by the blood drives
during the war is as real today as
it was then.

There is an additional need for
blood because of the recent experi-
ments with gamma globulin in the

Earnest,” “Shadow and Substance,”| fight against polio. It is believed

that this new medicine will prove
itself to be very beneficial in the
fight against the dread disease.

Some of the blood donated here
will be used locally in Meckien-
burg County, but the greater part
will"be sent elsewhere for use in
the veterans’ hospitals where the
need is so great.

The drive is being jointly spon-
sored this spring by Scabbard and
Blade and ODK. The sponsoring
organizations are planning an in-

tensive campaign with Charley, oy the tour by their director, Mr.

Hasty and Fred Stowe acting as
co-chairmen, representing Scabbard
and Blade and ODK, respectively.

Completion Date Sef
For New Belk Dorm

Present indications are that the
Belk Dormitory will be ready for
use on or about February 1, 1955,
Mr. Grier Martin, treasurer of the
college, said today.

The date will vary in accordance
with weather conditions and avail-
ability of necessary materials.

The building is to be of rein-
forced concrete throughout. The
concrete is being poured now for
the basement floor on the east
side. As soon as this is completed,
the wood forms will be removed
and used for the floor for pour-
ing the concrete on the west side.

Then the masons will Jay the
brick walls on the east side,
simultaneously with the pouring of
concrete on the west. The brick
layers and concrete pourers will
be working on opposite sides from
now until the top floor is com-
pleted.

The dormitory, being constructed
by Thompson-Street contractors, is
under the local supervision of Mr.
Charles 8. Ballard.

DUPONT PROGRAM
COMES TO DAVIDSON

Dr. John Gallent of the depart-
ment of chemistry has announced
that Davidson will be included in
the program of the Dupont Com-
pany designed to assist and advance
'|the teaching of chemistry in
American colleges.

The Dupont program is one of
grants to colleges to be used to
aid in the training of students ma-
joring in chemistry. It has been
extended to 19 colleges since its in-
ception in 1953. Only one other
school in the South, Emory Uni-
versity, has been incorporated in
the program by Dupont.

Grants of $2,500 have been
awarded to colleges participating
in this program for the first time
this year. These funds are to be
used at the discretion of the chem-
istry departments of the individual
colleges.

In addition to Davidson and
Emory the colleges sharing in the
program for the first time this
year include the following: Alle-
gheny, Bates, Beloit, Bucknell,. Col-
gate, College of St. Thomas, Grin-
nell, Hope, Kalamazoo, Kenyon,
Knox, Lafayette, Manchester, Mt.
Holyoke, Rennselaier Tech, Whea-
ton, Williams, and Worchester
Tech. .

Dr. J. S. Wilson Scheduled

For Novel Discussion

Dr. James Southall Wilson will
direct an informal discussion to-
night in the College Union Ball-
room at 8:15 on “The Modern
Novel.” All students and the public
are urged to attend: The discussion
will be followed by a coffee hour.

The Davidsonisn requests the

in the past by soliciting donations
from their members. Certificates
of merit for the fraternities whose
members have 100 per cent par-
ticipation will again be given.

The ROTC Department will lend
a helping hand with the drive and
assist with such administrative de-
tails as setting up the equipment
in the gymnasium, keeping records,
etc. There will again be competi-
tion between the various ROTC
classes, thus creating a competi-
tive spirit which has proved to aid
the drive. .

The bloodmobile will be in John-
ston Gymnasium from eleven un-
til five on the two days. Local
ladies will do a repeat performance
of their worthwhile and useful
services of handling the paper
work connected with the dona-
tions.

This time it is planned to have
more nurses with the bloodmobile
and enough local ladies helping
to insure that the program will
be run smoothly. It is hoped that
this will eliminate all waiting on
the part of the donors, and thereby

Male Chorus On Tour
Thru Northern States

By JIM MARSHALL

The Davidson College Male
Chorus left Wednesday morning
for an 1ll-day tour of the Middle
North.

The group of thirty singers have
a promising schedule including
three high schools in Toledo, Ohio,
Bowling Green (Ohio) University,
the University of Michigan, Sullins
College, and churches in Grosse
Pointe, and Detroit, Mich. and
Huntington, W. Virginia.

The students are accompanied

Almost all of the 160 fraternity
pledges at. Davidson who are eligi-
ble for initiation will ‘be sporting
their fraternity pins when they
leave for spring holidays next
week. At least one fraternity, how-
ever, is planning to wait until
later in the month to confer mem-

Donald Plott; organist and accom-
panist, Mr. Philip K. Gehring; and
Mr. Herbert Russell.

A modern, new Trailway bus has

been chartered for the entire trip.
And the driver is popular T. C.

Ingram, who has driven the Male

Chorus on their spring tour for 21
successive years.

While on the road the singers
will stay in hotels, college dorms
on campuses where they have con-
certs, and in homes of families in
whose church they sing.

The Mid-Northern Tour has
taken much planning and the well-
organized group is a credit to Mr.
Plott and the officers of the Male
Chorus who are: Leonard Geiger,
president; Thorny Frick, veep;
Bob Mack, secretary. Committees
were appointed before departure
to manage each and every phase of
the trip.

The Chorus has arranged both
a “secular” and “sacred” concert.
Tuxedos will be worn to the
former and robe> to the latter.
They have plans for “informal con-
certs” which inevitably arise on
their tours.

The following students are mak-
ing the tour: Bill Bryson, Will
Little, Bob Klugh, Ernest Mason,
Alan Sparks, Joe Garrison, Pat
Miller, Bob Crutchfield, Jim Faires,

bership upon its pledges.

Pi Kappa Alpha was the only
one of the eleven social Greek let-
ter organizations to follow the cus-
tom of initiation before Mid-
Winters. The main cause of the
unusually long period of “pledge
training” for the other aspirants
was due to the college ruling which
required all freshmen to eat at
the College Union first semester.
As a result most of the fraterni-
ties felt that they needed a longer
time to establish a mutual frater-
nity spirit between brothers and
pledges.

The PiKAs held their formal
initiation Thursday night, Feb-
ruary 18, in the fraternity house.
Initiates were Jerry Brook: Steve
Huntley, Irving Walther, George
Scott, Randy Johnson, and Edgar
Heath. During the intermission at
the formal Mid-Winters dancr
Steve Huntley received both the
outstanding pledge and scholarship
awards. Two other PiKA pledges
who hope to be initiated within
the next week on the basis of six-
week grades are Mack Hamer and
Ken Conger.

The Sigma Chis began the series
of formal initiations for the week
when they conferred brotherhood
on 17 pledges Tuesday night. Taken
