Ann Hatfield

Speak up and speak out

Okay, I’m sitting here poised
at the edge of my seat, Coke can
within arm’s length, eagerly
smacking a mouth full of gum. I’m
in writing mode and I should be
ready, right? Instead, I’m strug-
gling with my weekly news article
—mentally ticking offall the things
Ihave todo before bedtime. That’s
when I decided to write this Opin-
ions article. You see, the speaking
tradition at Davidson (or lack
thereof) has bothered and puzzled
me since freshman year. ;

Let me give you a scenario:
you’re late for your 9:30 class in
Chambers, you rush out the door
of Watts and, along the way, you
pass Bob. Now, you have been
aware of Bob since freshman year;
you’ve seen him countless times
on the Court and in Humes lec-
"tures, but youcan’t remember hav-
ing ever actually met him. Here
comes the big dilemma. Do you
speak to Bob by name, do you give
him a harried smirk-smile and the
obligatory “Hi,” or do you put your
head down, hurry to class and pre-
tend that you don’t see him?

On first consideration, you
might think that I am overdrama-
tizing the banal, but I am willing to
bet that almost everyone on cam-
pus has dealt with this big deci-

have a working

classroom?

sion. Should I or shouldn’t I flash
those pearly whites, wave franti-
cally and call out clear across cam-
pus? Okay, so it’s easy if Sally’s
your best friend, swimming part-
ner and hallmate, but what about
the other 75% of people on campus

that you only know by name?
Why doesn’t Davidson have

the comforting “speaking tradition”

of its sister school 300 miles to the

‘North? All of my conversational

life, I have heard stories about the
great speaking tradition of Wash-
ington and Lee, in which students
are bound by common respect.to
greet their neighbor.

I mean, how difficult can it be
to speak to a person, single that
person out and show that you
thought enough to remember his
or her name?

The same principle applies to
the classroom, andl’ mjustas guilty
as the next person. When I re-
turned from my term at Oxford; I
vowed to make a concerted effort
to participate in class. Somewhere
between senior year in high school
and sophomore year in college, I
got out of the habit of active par-
ticipation. -

Unfortunately, I feel that 3/4
of the student body shares my
newfound passivity. And anyone
can identify with that embarrassed
silence when an energized profes-

sor does everything short of stand-
ing on the desk to elicit some re-
sponse from that half-dead, apa-
thetic 8:30 class.

Well anyway, I’m sitting in

planned to say? As I am not a
pubescent boy and don’t remem-
ber being intimidated in high
school, I dare say it is Davidson’s
conditioning.

Why don’t we have a working
speaking tradition, a practice that
could also be applied to the class-
room? |

Why are titillating class dis-
cussions reserved for only mid-
morning classes and why don’t we
greet Bob and Sally by name?

What would you do to improve social life at Davidson?
I would try to encourage more communication between students. The
reason that there’s not that much communication is that most tose
don’t interact with each other. I guess you would have retreats and

deserve it

Charlotte sports fans look at
the paper or TV andare hearing the
word; one of the hottest college
basketball teams is “in their back-
yard.” That yard is Belk Arena,
one of the more underpopulated
places when our 20-3 team takes
the court.

Saturday’s game against
Marshall is Senior Day, and Bran-
don, Chris, Quinn, Jeff, and Mark
have earned the right to play in
front of a capacity crowd.

We should be very proud of
our team, and while the support
has been good, this special group
of guys deserves more.

The five seniors now boast

nearly 20 years of collegiate sports
experience, including the night of
gut-wretiching tragedy two years
ago in the finals of the Southern
Conference Tournament in
Asheville. They were all there.
Many of us were, too — the
Davidson crowd which showed up
that Sunday night was impressive.
That game only increased the long-
ing of the players, coaches, and
fans to secure a NCAA tourna-
ment berth.

Now, after a disappointing
season, the team has gelled under
the leadership of these seniors and
looks to reach the next plateau.

During a game or in practice,

their level of poise, concentration,
and focus is exemplary. They use
their heads and communicate and
execute extremely well. Their pa-
tient shot-selection on offense
shows great maturity.

Defensively, their tenacity is
inspiring — I never realized how
exciting it is to watch the oppo-
nents not take a shot. They are a
thrill to watch, and we all can learn
something from their competitive
spirit and sportsmanship.

So, let’s get behind them Sat-
urday. Come, and be ready to
make noise. They’ve earned our

support.
