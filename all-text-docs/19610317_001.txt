The plays were given Monday
and Tuesday nights, and critic-

Two of the plays were pre-

FIVE GOALS |and research papers.

Fraternity spot boxes do not
break the Honor System, Lacy
said. However, professors should
realize the existence of spot
boxes and should make out tests
accordingly. Professors are
asked to give students their defi-
nitions of pledged work and
make it in accordance with the
Honor System.

Lacy explained that unless it
is specifically stated by the pro-
fessor, students get the idea
work is unpledged.

“Honor is a spirit and has to
be a part of each student,” Lacy
said. “And if this is not ful-
filled, there is no need for an
Honor System.”

Olympics, Brubeck, Ball
Are Miniature Weekend

Saturday, March 25, will be a weekend in miniature on the Davidson campus,

with the Davidson-Queens Olympics, the Dave Brubeck Quartet concert and the

tary Ball all scheduled for that day.

The first event of the day will
be the second annual Davidson-
Queens Olympics, to be held at
2:30 in the football stadium.
This will feature Queens sorori-
ties competing in such events as
tricycle races, pie eating con-
tests (no hands), chicken catch-
ing contests, and baseball bat
races.

A special surprise event will
be announced at the Olympics.
Members of Davidson and
Queens faculties also will vie
in a scooter race.

A highlight of the afternoon
will be the judging for the Sex-
iest Man on Campus, for which
each fraternity will nominate
a candidate.

The cost for the Olympics is
50 cents per person. Proceeds
will go to the Holy Angel Nurs-
ery in Belmont, an interdenomi-
national home for mentally re-
tarded and physically handicap-
ped children under six.

The nursery is supported en-

tirely by individual contribu-
tions, and the donation from the
Olympics is needed to make
possible an expansion of the

Gymnasium, with music furn-
ished by the Delicardos. Time
for the dance will be 9:30 to 12,

Following the Olympics, the
