Davidson Hi-Y Club To
Send Delegates North

Club -To--Send ‘Casey Jones
And Cite Man To Ohio

Plans to send a delegate to the
third national Hi-Y conference
were discussed at the meeting of
‘the Davidson High School Hi-Y.
The club desires to send one rep-
resentative and Casey Jones, club
leader, to the convention.

The third national conference is
being held at Oberlin College, Ohio,
the first two being held at Berea
College in Kentucky ~in1936-and
1938. Delegates from each of the
forty-eight states and territories as
well as a number from foreign
countries are expected to attend.

June 20 through 24 is the date
set_for the gathering. Although
the program has not been com-
pleted,» plans have’ been made to
have speakers of national import-
ance lecture on all phases of Y.
'M. C. A. work and sociology. Dis-
cussion groups will be held and the
delegates will be allowed to air
their problems and through mu-
tual aid to, be given a chance to
solve them from each other’s ex-

| ficer

periences.

To be eligible to attend the con-
ference the delegate must be an of-
of local Hi-Y ~chapter
and must have at least one more
year in high school. Definite plans
for sending a representative have
not been made as yet,’ ‘although
Casey will go, independent
of the club.

Warning For Would-Be Authors

Some time ago Edgar B. Wesley,
professor of education at the Uni-

versity of Minnesota, received an
8l-cent royalty check for a book
he had helped to write.

By the time he had: mailed a
share of the check to each of his
three collaborators’— all of whom

live off the campus—he had 11 cents

to show for his trouble.
