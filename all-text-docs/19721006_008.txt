Balanced Air Force Attack
Stuns Wildcat Gridders 68-6

By FORD NEWMAN
Staff Writer

The Davidson Wildcat foot-
ball team suffered =a
devastating defeat to the Air
Force Academy 68-6 at Falcon
Stadum Saturday.

The 17th ranked. undeteated
Falcons were quite impressive.
breaking three school ofiensive
records while handing the Wild-
cats their worst defeat in 51
years.

The Falcons rolled up 35 first
downs (26 rushing) and ac-
cumulated 625 total offensive
yards. An 87-yard scoring pass
from backup quarterback Bob
Thompson to end Bob Farr also
made the record books.

“They are a fine. fine team.
One of the strongest in the coun-
try.” Davidson coach Dave
Fagg said of the Air Force.
“They had tremendous balan-
ce. They can both run and throw
extremely well.”

This was quite evident as
Falcon fullback Bill Berry
amassed a total of 149 vards in
20 carries which was 58 more
yards than the Davidson total
yardage figure. Tailback Joel
Carlsen added #3 vards in 17
carries.

The Air Force passing attack
was led by junior quarterback
Rich Haynie who completed 18
passes for 107 yards before
yielding to Thompson.

“They had the quickest defen-
se we'll see all year.” Fagg
remarked. “They played pretty
much like they wanted to in
their opening wins over lowa

and Pitt. I feel positive that they
will be ranked among the top
ten teams in the country before
the end of the year.”

But Fagg felt that the game
was better than the score in-
dicated.

“On our best day we would
have had a fine game.’ Coach
Fagg said. “We let them get off
the hook on third and long
situations on several occasions.
Silly mistakes like fumbles and
penalties hurt, too.”

Coach Fagg also noted the in-
consistency of the offense
multiplied the problems for the
defense which found itself with
its back against the wall all at-
ternoon.

“Lesser people would have
given up and been em-
barrassed,”’ Fagg said. “It took
a lot of pride and courage to go
ahead and play and try to
score.

The Wildcats did finally score
in the fourth quarter with fresh-
man running back  Jeft
Heinicka carrying the ball over
for the score capping an 80-vard
youchdown drive.

According to Fagg this
scoring march was engineered
while Air Force still had some
ot their best plavers still in the
game.

Fayy telt the Wildcats fought
till the very end. Because
Davidson was playing catch-up
ball. several wild passes in the
fourth quarter resulted in-in-
terceptions which led to Air
Force touchdowns.

Fagg also said that he was
very pleased with the Cats’

altitude was not a factor in the
game.

A bright spot noted by Fagg
was the defensive play of
Woody Montgomery. Eddie
Womack, and freshman Jim
Deville.

Fagg said that Scotty Shipp
and Dave Harper both looked
good at quarterback.

Cats Bet Standing,
Style In Game

With Appalachian

By JIM SITTERSON
Stalt Writer

Head coach Dave Fagg sees
this Saturday's game with Ap-
palachian as having more at

’ stake than conference stan-

dings.

Fagg believes that the game
will Fe a battle of old against
new, large against the small.

Davidson must prove that
they can still win against the
larger teams in the conterence.

Appalachian in their second
year as a conference member
must prove that they can beat
the older. more established
teams in the conference.

Both teams will go into Satur-
day's game, coming off disap-
pointing and discouraging per-
formances in the past several
weeks.

Saturday looms as the test of
the Wildcat’s ability to come
back.

Appalachian suffered a last
minute 20-17 defeat at the hands
of Furman last’ week.
Previously, Appalachian beat
Western Kentucky 7-6. lost a
close game to The Citadel 21-28,
and was deleated 35-7 by East
Carolina.

Appalachian’s strength lies in
their running backs. Fagg
respects the talents of halfback
Charlie Haugabrook. and
fullback Tommy Harris who
picked up 101 yards in 19 carries
against Furman.

Fagg stressed that Ap-
palachian has a lot of depth at
these positions. with several
other backs who, ‘can really

carry the ball.” according to
Fagg.

Fagg expects Appalachian to
run a little more than pass
against the Wildcats.

“They ‘ll want to come out and
want to win this one real bad af-
ter last week's game.” was
Fagg’s summary of Ap-
palachian’s attitude.

Fagg has cause for optimism
this Saturday. Injuries have
plagued the Wildcats tor the
past several games. Saturday
quarterback Scotty Shipp and
running back John Webel will
return to action

“This is as healthy as we've
been in four or five weeks”
Fagg said.

The defense has consistently
improved with the last two
games and Fagg believes that
this encouraging trend will
carry over to Saturday.

Fagg also noted that the
game which will be played in
Charlotte, will be the first home
game. Fagy feels that playing
in front of a home crowd will
mean a lot to the team.

Fagg summed up his feelings
regarding the game. “The team
has not put together a real good
game yet. but I believe that
they'll put everything together
on Saturday. Sometimes you
just get the feeling that this is
the Saturday. and thai’s the
feeling I've got for this Satur-
day.”

“*Belore the season started, |
told the boys that if we staved
healthy and they played the
way they're capable of. then
some exciting things would hap-
pen on the field.”

Heinicka Likes Varsity Play

By DAVID MELTON
Asst. Sports Editor

Freshmen are now elgible to
play varsity major college
athletics and the Davidson
Wildcat football team has taken
advantage of this new rule. A
prime example of a fresrmen
playing varsity athletics is Jeff
Heinicka.

The 5-10, 175 pound freshman
is now a major contender for an
offensive backfield position,
and has displayed fine efforts in
the last two Wildcat games.

Against Lenoir Rhyne. three
weeks ago. Heinicka sparked a
Wildcat scoring drive with a 50
yard romp after catching a
screen pass.

Then in the Air Force game
Heinicka gained 50 yards on the
ground for the Wildcats. and
scored their only touchdown in
the game on a one yard plunge.

Heinicka likes Davidson
College football. He feels that
“It gives one a chance to play
against major colleges.”

He also added that “It's not
like a job so much here, as it
would be at another, larger
place.”

When asked what prompted
him to come to Davidson, he
replied that it is “the chance
that I could play football and

get a good education at the
same time.”

At Davidson, Heinicka feels
that “It's hard to play football
and study too,’ however.

When the Seminole, Florida
native first came to Davidson,
he didn’t think he had a chance
to play varsity football. ‘‘I was
real discouraged at first,’’ he
said.

Heinicka does think freshmen
get just as much of a chance to
play varsity football as anyone
else.

“The upperclassmen help us
out quite a bit. and the coaches
give us a pretty good chance,”
he said.

Heinicka, who plays behind
John Webel and Dave Ingold,
thinks ‘Everybody has to have
confidence to play ball.”

Heinicka enjoyed the Wild-
cats’ trip to Colorado Springs
last week-end. “It was fan-
tastic. That was the first time
I'd ever been out there.” he
said.

He also feels that trips like
that are good for the school. “It
makes football real fun and it
also helps recruiting.” he
stated.

Heinicka also expressed the
fact that Cosch Ernie Tall. as
well as the other coaches and
upperclassmen. have helped

him since he came to Davidson.

Heinicka feel that the Wild-
cats can have a good season. ‘I!
think we've got the capabilities
of winning the Southern Con-
ference championship.’’ he
said.

He also admits that right now,
the offense is having some
problems but he added ‘‘We
know we can win."’
