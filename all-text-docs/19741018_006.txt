Davidson Heroes Attain
Glory By Timid Resistanee

Oh, where are NA heroes of
Davidson? In bandages, I do
believe.

Walking down just one flight
of stairs on a Monday, I meta

Where are the closet heroes
of Davidson? I suspect they
could be easily found. Take

scream, place her in the

like to wander the campus and

ask directions to the library.

Yet timid resistance may be

D.H. Lawrence liked movies about

as much as factories. He would be —

horrified if he could see the film Ken
Russell has made of ‘Women in

and mine. - a

from the book and provides an
accurate transcription of Lawren-
cian themes, but the themes are
trivia] removed from context. And
Russell couldn’t care less about
them.

Like ‘‘Memories Within Miss
Aggie,’’ ‘““Women in Love’”’ consists
of more or less serious passages
which lead to frankly sensational
ones, and these are what the film is
really about.

Gerald Crich and Gudrun

Brangwen, Lawrence’s forces of
darkness, steal the movie from
Rupert Birkin and Ursula Brangwen
just as surely as Milton’s Great
Golden Angel steals ‘‘Paradise
Lost” from the Godhead.
’ Considering ‘the script, director
and actors, this was bound to hap-
pen. Rupert is a stand-in for the
author in the novel, and Alan Bates
is made up to look like Lawrence in
the movie. :

Russell’s idea of artistic goukres
is that they are lively and jump
around a lot. He has inflicted this
conception upon Bates, and the
resulting performance is even less
successful than that of Scott An-
thony in the similar role in “Savage
Messiah.”

film never come off so well as the
nymphomaniacs. The major female

are all in sexually hysterical roles. _

He is one of the foremost directors
of actresses in our time, and even his
“good” females are usually nicely
enacted. Jennie Linden’s Ursula is
one of the paler ones, however.

Oliver Reed, a fine actor, has
never been so good as in “The
Devils,”’ where he rises to unex-
pected stature, equalling the best of
Richard Burton. His Gerald is his
performance before his major one,
and one sign of the quality of his
work is that Glenda Jackson does
not completely wipe him off the
screen, as she usually does to her
romantic leads,

Seething with melodramatic

- passions, Reed still manages to

bring a degree of control to his role.
He is fairly convincing and quite for-
ceful. At his best, he is a perfect ac-
tor for Russell’s movies.

Glenda Jackson is one of the many
actresses who have done their best
work under Russell. Like Reed’s
major accomplishment, hers is con-

tained in the film made immediately :

after ‘Women in Love.’’ Only a few
moments of her Gudrun equal her
great Nina.

In thé latter role, Jackson exploits
her hatural qualties as an actress
and plays a snarling nymphomaniac
scourge to all homosexuals, in the
Bernhardt manner. As Gudrun, her
plainness is rather miraculously
concealed by expert make-up and
cinematography.

While hardly demure, she is more
restrained. Gudrun wants. to be
chased; Nina is an aspiring rapist.
Jackson creates! a fine charac-
terization in ‘‘Women in Love,” but

aaa!

The comparison that is often made
of Jackson with Bette Davis is a
valid one.’ Some -critics seek to
dismiss both as camp artists, which
is an odious mistake. ‘‘Camp’’ lacks
the depth of great acting and is
merely a silly burlesque of the form
which many great actors are driven
to in their searches for ex-
pressiveness.

Sometimes there is an overlap of
greatness and camp, as in the case
of Tallulah Bankhead. But the best
work of Jackson'and Davis seems to
me to fall clearly into the realm of:
serious acting.

Those who call these actresses
camp artists are confusing highly
baroque, exquisitely precise
technique with comic buffoonery.
While I may chuckle over the ex-
cesses of some of their per-
formances after the movies, I am
mever tempted to do so while wat-
ching.

“Women in Love” is a fecund
mess. Almost every aspect of the
film is as talented and uneven as the
acting.

(A.couple of the supporting per-
formances are dreadful.) Russell
generally does not have the in-
clination or the the patience or even
the intellectual strength to create
sustained films. His most recent
films, however are becoming
stronger taken as wholes.) |

What he has is a tremendous
amount of talent. Those who call him
a mad genius exaggerate. His
imagination is neither that sharp nor
his unevenness. that erratic. His
casting of Mick Jagger as Liszt in an
upcoming film is a reflection of his
personality rather than any mental
instability. It is a tragedy that
Jagger didn’t play Tchaikovsky in
“The Music Lovers.’’

Russell is not a camp artist, but he

Jackson. (I am not speaking here of
the Davis of the last decade or so.)
Russell creates some of the most
heart-stoppingly beautiful moments
ever put on film and satirizes them
at the same time.

They .demand to be taken
seriously, and most sensitive
viewers do so. But Russell does not.
He is as cynical as the Shakespeare
who wrote ‘‘Troilus’’ and Cressida.”
Russell’s films are violent collisions
of comedy and drama. He realizes
that art is -essentially . artifice,
illusion, contrivance.

His movies abound with theatrical
make-up, Oriental scarves and some
of the best dance sequences ever put
on film. He works with the basic
Hollywood -cliches and turns them
into gold. In ‘‘Women in Love,”
there is a slow motion scene of nude
lovers running towards each other in
a field of waving grass. This has
been done a thousand times before.

Only Russell finds the truth within
it and, all at once, it becomes no
longer cliche. This sequence is not
the most. beautiful in ‘‘Women in
Love,” nor are the most beautiful in
Russell’s career. I use this scene
because it illustrates my point
clearly, not because it is a favorite.

“Women in Love” is my: “Last
Tango in Paris,” “L.A. Plays Itself’
and ‘Lola Montes.’’ The first
couple of times I saw the film, it
had an erotic effect on me as strong
as that of “‘Last Tango in Paris’’ and
“L.A. Plays Itself’? upon Pauline
Kael and Stuart Byron.

With later viewings, the affair
became increasingly Platonic, like
that of Andrew Sarris for “Lola
Montes.” ‘“‘Women in Love” is my
favorite movie by my favorite direc-
tor. I love it for its strengths and its
faults.
