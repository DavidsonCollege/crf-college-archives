So, you're all ‘‘strung out”’

general fear of whether you'll

Neisler Challenges Barbecue Criticism

To the Editor:

For those of us who have
faith in the future of Davidson
and other good colleges, it is
reassuring to observe that
student writers such as the
one responsible for the ‘‘Ne
Ultra Greenback’’ piece
(February 1 DAVIDSONIAN)
eventually develop some
maturity and judgement and
even a modicum of good taste
in later years.

To the Editor:

Mr. Doug Brown, by his own
assessment, is a student at a
college whose administration
deceives her benefactors by
‘ over’’ Davidson’s
many faults. This is partially
accomplished through the
smooth tongued wizardry of

Long

These people are not
motivated by any sincere in-
terest in Davidson. They
selfishly support Davidson in
order that they may have a
“tax writeoff”’, whatever that
is. (It sounds very evil and
dishonest).

nothing of economics at

questions the ideas of John
Maynard Keynes).

Holshouser, but the ex-

the good fortune to “rise

background.

During th past year, it was

contact with hundreds of sup-

porters of Davidson College. I

did not find them to be

shallow, selfish, or un-
wealthy.

Not only did they give of
their money to help Davidson
College (and, incidentally,
also help Mr. Brown), but
more importantly they gave of

To the Editor:

Last Sunday evening
(February 3, 1974) Mac Leger-
ton gave a talk on migrant
workers in California. In the
typical Davidson tradition,
less than ten students showed
up to hear of the power elite’s:
exploitation of the farm
workers. I can only conclude
that the rest of the student
body was either studying, wat-
ching television, or indulging
in some other socially ac-
cepted activity.

Why has this benign in-
difference overcome tne
student body? Are other
universities having to cope
with this mass lethargy?

Our time is highly organized
by the administration: we are
supposed to spend the

entertainment.

In essence, we either spend
our lives memorizing facts for
professors or attempting to
lose consciousness in an in-
tensive escapism. Time
passes, and instead of
thinking, we absorb in-
formation like mindless
robots. The other hours of the
day are uneventful and un-

creative.

In class the Davidson
student learns to absorb huge
amounts of information and

However, in a letter to a
friend, J.C. Hall, he wrote
something that sums up for
me a new way to view
whatever it is I worry about.
He said that

anyone or to admit any hope of
a better world is criminally
foolish, as foolish as it is to
stop working for it.

“It sounds silly to say work
without hope, but it can be

surance; it doesn’t mean work
