“Hi, Ho, Silver!
Welcome Converse! Davidson's Student

Body is fortunate in having the opporeunity to
entertain for an aiternoon such a bevy oi gils.
Let's rwake this day one of the best of its kind
ever held at Davidson. ft won: be hard —if
everyone cooperates.

Arrangements tor the gala affair have been

worked out by Omicron Deita Kappa and a
commitiee beaded by Dick Kenyon and Bob
Ramsey, Converse Student Body received the
invitation with enthusiasm. and are sending a
delegation of beter than 150 girls to our shady
campus.
_The affair can be a success or a decided fail-
ure. Experience of such days held in the past
proves that such doings creates a better fecling,
relation, ete., between two schools and if we
want Converse girls to go hack with the feel-
ing that Davidson is the one and only college in
these United States of America for them, we
must put the plan over.

Go and sign up for 2 date! You might meet
your future wite this coming Saturday and
think of the loss 1@ you don’t sign up and hap-
pen to lose this chance! The committee has
virtually slaved in planning and arranging a
program that will keep those that have cates
well entertained all aiternoon, There won't be
a dull moment. 7

Cooperation, however, is the thing that is
needed. We'd hate to see 150 be-ootiful girls
come on the campus and have about fifty boys
to try to entertain them. Oi course the fifty
boys would be entirely satisfied—to have three
or four girls at once—but think of the girls.
And think, too, if you should see four girls,
attractive girls, around one boy, maybe you'll
wish then. that you had signed for a date.

Think, too! Here's a chance to take a girl to
a football game without dishing out a green-
back or two to do it.

Repeated

A few weeks ago an editorial addressed in

colunin, Possibly it went unnoticed as many
“suhs trom this editorial has vet to be seen. For
vhe benetit of those that did not see this edi-
torial we will give you the main gist of it. .
The lack of sophomores and .ireshmen out
for publication work, especially for the David-
sonian is in a sad state of atfairs. Fraternities
once strived to outdo other fraternities—in

—quenuly those that-have charge of_putting ou!

scholarship, “ea@ership, and extra-curricular

gohe—dead. No more do fraternities urge, or
even foree as they used to do, their under-
classmen 1 go om for such extra work. Consc-

such publications have harder jobs. It-is a big

burdensfor them to aphotd the standards Set .

down by previous leaders.

-Onee again a plea to the fraternities is stated.
J.et’s get back that old spirit of friendly rival=
ism between our nine chapters and see which
~can send the.best and most men out.for such

work. Jt would help those in charge of the
work, the fraternities, aad those freshmen and

sophomores participating in the work.
Again we repeat—thiak about it, fraternities,

—it’s worth a thought.

If you want to be an “A” student, take the
advice of Harold L. Hoffman, a psychology
major at Lenoir Rhyne College.

Here are some steps to academic success that
he recommerids :

1.—Study. Remember that those students
labcled “geniuses” really study for their su-
perior marks.

2.—Love “alt” the opposite sex, not just one
of said sex.

—3.—Cultivate a liking for your professors _

and for your studies. Hard to do perhaps, but
if at least a neutral attitude is adopted toward
each professor and each study, and a sincere
effort is made to master the subject, success
will be yours.

4.—Every college student has someone inter-
ested in his success—a father, mother, sister,
brother, perhaps a sweetheart. Develop an ‘I'll
show you” attitude. Prove to those financial,

particular to the fraternities appeared in this

GLEANINGS.

on behalf of the Pan-Hellenic
Council for the fine support given
us on the Homecoming set of
danees. Not.only in attendance but,
in carrying out the rules that are
set up for us to go by. We appre-
ciated it very much andhopc it
will. continue fi the future. om

You can be assured that we are
doing, and will continue to do, all
we can to get -the biggest and best
band in the country for our Mid-
Winters set. As you know, a great
many of our favorite bands are
not on tour at that time and it is
impossible to get them regardless
of any price you can offer. This
is duc £6 commercial radio programs
and hotel engagements. The Pan-

loving and/or spiritual backers that- you are
equal to the task. *

5.—Be a good “mixer’+—put on the old per-~
sonality with your associates, for creating a
favorable attitude in the eyes of your fellow
students will make you as an individual happy,
light-hearted, and free—desired qualities for a
successful student.

“PRIVATE LIVES OF ELIZA-

Olivia de Haviland, Vincent Price,
Harry Dansell, Alan Hale.

Here is the first of a series of

and it is undoubtedly one of the
best movies of the year. To those
who know_anything at all about
the screen recognize the name -of
Bette Davis as the green light to
go to the movies, because her per-
formances in the past have merited

Hollywood. Her opposite, Errol
Flynn, makes the picture a mar-
velous production. It is in techni-
color, and it is full of English and
European history. An absolute
“must” picture:

“ESPIONAGE AGENT” — Joel
McCrea, Brenda Marshall, Jeff-
rey Lynn, George Bancroft, Mar-
-tin Kosleck, Nana Bryant, and
James Stephenson.

The picture is timely because it is
about war, and ‘it is a sort of sequel
to “Confessions of a Nazi Spy” —
only better. Joel McCrea plays.the
part of a promising young diplomat
who has been trained in foreign
diplomatic service. On the eve of
his returning to Washington he
marries a mysterious, beautiful
young girl, who through no fatlt of
her own, has been in the espionage
service of a foreign country. When
Joel_learns the truth about her he

her the name of ‘the best-actress ‘in|

resigns his government job, and the
two of them dedicate their lives to
rounding up the big shots of the
spy system only to return to Wash-
ington as heroes. Don't miss it if
you are not Duke-Carolina-ing.

“HOTELS FOR WOMEN” — Elsa
Maxwell, Linda Darnell, } Ann
Sothern, James Ellison.

Here you will “find shades of
“Stage Door;”, you will see a lot
of models and chorus girls living
in a hosltery, presided over by Elsa
Maxwell and follow them in their
troubles. Ann Sothern is very good,
indeed, and Linda Darnell is one of
the bright young starlets of today’s

the romantic lead.
