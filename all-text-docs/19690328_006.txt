Legistatures, HEW Knock Student Protest

Governor Ronald Reagan of California has urged
that national legislation be enacted to punish persons
inciting campus disorders and institutions allowing
such disorders. .

A backdrop for Reagan’s remarks was provided
by passage in the Texas legislature of a bill cutting
off state funds to students engaged in campus dem-
onstrations which disrupt the activity of the institu-
tion and by the proposal of a similar bill in the Penn-
sylvania legislature.

In the meantime, Secretary of Health, Education
and Welfare Robert H Finch, previously lieutenant
governor of California, has said that federal law al-
ready requires the U.S. government to cut off federal
aid to any siudent convicted of inciting or participat-
ing in campus riots.

Sarah Lawrence Students Protest

Students at Sarah Lawrence College. which this
year admitted its first male students, seized the ad-
ministration building in protest against a tuition raise
which, protesters said, would cause the college to
remain “a school for rich girls.”

Fifty-six women and four men were involved.

Guilford Students Boycott Slater

Guilford students have staged a walk-out from
their cafeteria after it received a B rating from the
State Board of Health.

The Guilfordian, the student newspaper, indicated
that the walk-out was the culmination of a long period
of student dissatisfaction with the cafeteria.

_ The cafeteria is run by ARA Slater Food Services,
which also runs the Davidson College Union Cafeteria.

Board
Named

Dr: Samuel R. Spencer Jr.,
president of the college, has
appointed a commission to
govern the radio station. Dr.
John Hopkins. professor of
physics. is chairman of the
student-faculty commission.
Ed Dobbs. who is the student
manager of the station. will
sit on the commission along
with six other students.

The radio station was given
a boost when Dr. Spencer
promised that the school
would provide operating ex-
penses for the station. ‘We
stil] have to get the money
for the starting of the station,
said Dobbs.

“The reason that we have
to furnish the starting money
ourselves is that the college
has no funds left to give us,”
said Jimmy Wright. who is
on the staff of the station.
“It will probably cost us
about $4000." said Wright.
“We have sent out inquiries
to Davidson alumni who are
in radio, and we are hoping
for donations.”

A radio station request for
funds was turned down by
the Richardson Foundation.

“I learned about the com-
mission in a luncheon with
Dr. Spencer,”’ said Dobbs.
“At first I thought that the
faculty would be in control
of the commission. but I was
very pleased when I learned
that there would be this
many students on the com-
mission.”

test. and feel we have an ex-
cellent chance for victory.”

Coffee House Circuit
Polishes Performers

Filling the responsibility
for bringing good entertain-
ment to Davidson is the Hun-
gry d. a member of the col-
lege coffee house circuit
which was organized here
three years ago.

C. Shaw Smith, director of
the Union, is credited with
the idea for the coffee house
circuit. After a block book-
ing conference in Raleigh
three years ago, Smith dis-
cussed his coffee house plans
with Fred Weintreub, owner
of Greenwich Village’s Bit-
ter End Cafe. They discus-
sed the need for more col-
lege entertainers.

In the spring of 1966, Fred
Smoot, a stand-up comic and
impressionist, was invited to
Davidson for a week of per-
formances.

The enthusiastic response
to Smoot encouraged Smith
to find other schools to join
a circuit of coffee houses.
The North Carolina circuit
with 16 schools became the
first coffee house circuit.

According to Ed Embree.
former president of the Union
Board. the purpose of a cof-

Dean’s Office Will Approve
Motorcycles On Trial Basis

By DAN JOHNSTON
Staff Writer

Last week a memorandum
was distributed from Assist-
ant Dean of Students Jim
Terry's office which author-
ized the use of motorcycles
on campus for the spring
term.

This announcement was
the result of a decision by
the traffic committee of
which Terry is a member.
The action was prompted
by the request of three stu-
dents, Whit Ayres, Hal Iver.
son and Roy Lane, to allow
motorcycles on campus.

The .Traffic Committee.
which meets only for such
matters as this one. is com.
posed of Dean of Students
Richard C. Burts Jr., Terry,
Business Manager Robert A.
Currie. Mr. Grover Meetze.
Mr. E. N. Linker and Gary
Cash. the student representa
tive.

Whit Ayres. one of the pro-
tagonists in the matter,
said that many _ students
would like to see motorcycles
on campus as does Gary
Cash, ie student represent-
ative . .

Apparently this decision
was not a sudden one. Five
years ago motorcycles were
allowed on campus and as
the result of excessive noise
they were banned. However.
since then there has been
thought of allowing them
again on campus.

Terry stressed that this
matter is on a trial basis

only..A final decison will be
reached before the end of
spring term. Cooperation on
the part of the students is
the deciding factor. ;

Terry said motorcycles
will be confined to roadwayy
stock mufflers must be used
and safety helmets will be
worn by drivers and passen-
gers, as this is a N. C. state
law.

Because the use of motor-

cycles by students could
cause parking problems Ter-
ry said that special parking
areas for motorcycles would
possibly be provided in the
fall.

Students on general schol-
arships will be allowed to
own and keep motorcycles

on campus. This is due to
the low operational and main-
tenance costs of motorcycles.

of America in the Charlotte
area.

“The basic reason for my
resignation is a decision not
to pursue further a career
in education,” Terry said.
“My decision has nothing to
do with any particular inci-
dents or conflicts here.”

Terry's work in scouting
will involve training and se-
lection of adult leaders. as
well as fund raising and pub-
lic relations. He will probably
start as assistant district
director of the Boy Scouts
in the fall, Terry said.

He said the college has not

vide a system in which young
entertainers can go out and
play at schools for a week
at a time with low cost to
these schools.”

Embree commented that,
“Good talent is not necessar-
fly expensive talent.” At a
low price to the college, the
performers get a chance to
polish their act in an infor-
mal atmosphere. The groups
are able to introduce new
material and test their acts.

In the three years of the
Hungry d at Davidson, Jake
Holmes, Steve Gillette, the
Pickle Brothers, the Pozo
Seco Singers, and many other
groups have performed and
become quite successful.

About 140 schools and 40
entertainers are involved now
on the coffee house circuit
run by the Bitter End. The
music is generally folk pro-
gressing toward folk-rock.

Next week the Union will
present its eleventh Hungry
d, featuring Leatherwood and
Lisa. This will be the first
Hungry d under the co-man-
agement of Rob Krehbiel and
Glenn Mauney.

Mauney said, “The full po-
tential of the Hungry d has
not yet been realized. Stu-
dents understand that the
performers on the coffee
house circuit are profession
al and are in quest of an
audience to try out their
material.”
