While there was some dissen-
sion in the house to the action
Wallace said, “Nobody has com-
pletely stated that Rusk needs to
back down and change its mind.”
She also said that the motion was

voted on that night because, “more.

time would have put'us at.a great
risk and made us more vulner-
able.” She said, “The motion was
passed because of an attitude, fears
and feelings over time...not just
specifically because of the five in-
cidents mentioned in the letter.”

When asked why she has not
let others outside of Rusk read this
letter Wallace said, ““The individ-
ual things aren’t the most impor-
tant, its a feeling that people have.”
She also stated thatif the real prob-
lem is to be addressed it must go
deeper than just analyzing a few
specific incidents.

SAE President Steve Lilly is
confident that relations between

his house and Rusk will get better.
A delegation from SAE will speak
at Rusk’s next house meeting and
each house’s faculty adviser will
be present, Lilly said, “We’re all
obviously looking forward to the
discussion between our two houses
this Tuesday.”

According to A.T. Miller the
letter that he printed up last Thurs-
day was intended only for a select
few members of the faculty and
staff. Miller “felt a sense of ur-
gency” and drafted the letter after
hearing these allegations only the
night before. He did not plan on
this letter to be distributed across
campus and also stated that it
“wasn’t written for the Trustees.”
The letter does explicitly call on
the Trustees to “take steps to halt
these violent and illegal activities
at Davidson.” Miller said that this
letter was meant to be a prelude to
presenting. these concerns to a
faculty committee but admitted that
its distribution was not controlled
well.

The letter begins: “There is a
violent and dangerous group. of
students within the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon fraternity who have been

threatening the lives and safety of
other students on campus and de-
stroying the reputation of theirown
organization.” It goes on to de-
scribe various incidents that dis-
play such alleged actions of har-
assment and violence.

The controversy over this let-
ter involves its many inaccuracies
and statements based only on
rumor. Miller said, “I obviously
didn’t find out the truth about the
actions.” He also said, “The re-
search was inadequate, the point
was is the system working?” He
stated that he spoke with Dean
Terry about the allegations but he
failed to mention to Dean Terry his
intentions to write the letter. He
believed that in his conversation
with Dean Terry he had confirmed
some of the incidents mentioned in
the letter. Miller said, “I was tired
of hearing lots of talk about these
rumors.” Miller also said that he
had talked to several members of
SAE last semester about the direc-
tion of the house.

Miller acknowledged that he
had not talked to any members of
SAE inthe weeks prior to compos-
ing or distributing the letter. He

said, “‘No, I didn’t talk to them
about the incidents mentioned, that
was a mistake.” Lilly said that ina
house meeting last Thursday night
he invited anybody to talk with
him one-on-one about problems
they might have and he would not
disclose their name to anyone else.
Many of the alleged incidents
involve individuals and when asked
why it appeared in the letter that
SAE was being attacked asa group
Miller said there is a “fuzzy line
between what is done as an indi-
vidual and what is doneasa group.”
He said that the SAE’s he knows
are “fine individuals, but my con-
cern is what happens in the group,
what is the dynamic down there.”
He believes that the letter has had
mixed results. Miller said it is
positive that all this talk and com-
plaints have finally come out and
that its important for students to
know that there were some on the
faculty who supported the call for
action to be taken against this al-
leged violence and harassment. “I
don’t think these are problems that
should be solved only by Rusk.”
He also added that the nega-
tive aspects of the letter are that

“membc:s ut SAE have felt perse-
cuted and stigmatized.” He also
regretted the phrasing of the letter
and apologized again for his poor
handling of its distribution.

The letter mentions an inci-
dent involving two women who
were verbally abused and ended
up soaking weton the floor at SAE
on self-selection night. Lilly said,
“T don’t know all the details of that
evening, only the two women in-
volved know that.” This incident
remains unclear but Miller states
in his second letter that the women
“provided a written statement and
wish to remain anonymous.”

Another incident involving
SAE also remains unclear. A few
weeks ago several visiting students
from Wake Forest were involved
in fights with members of SAE. A
WFU student suffered serious
damage to his eye and _ still has
occasional blurry vision in thateye.
Dean Terry has had communica-
tion with the student and his father
and said that it will be two to three
weeks before they know if there is
permanent damage to the eye.
