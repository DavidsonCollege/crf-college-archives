’Cats To Meet Furman’s

Famed “House of Magic”

WEDNESDAY, OCT. 26, 1938

All-American selections by writers all over the country will soon
appear all over sport pages, but no matter who makes it, some coach,
player or fan will not agree with the selections. Not in order to rush
things or disagree with the above named, and after reading accounts of
most major games of the country, it looks like the following men should
or will make the coveted team: Marshall Goldberg, Pittsburgh, at full-
back and Captain Moore of Minnesota, and Cafego, of Tennessee, at
half-backs; Luckman of Columbia’at quarterback. On the end positions,
Daddio of Pitt, and Holland of @6rnell, lead the pack.
Christian and Notre the tackle While
ovski of Pitt and Twedell of Minnesota take the guard posts. Aldrich

Hale of Texas
3einor of Dame get slots Lez-
of Texas Christian gets the snapper-back post over Brock of Nebraska
and Duke’s Dan Hill.

Other outstanding possibilities include, ends—Wysockie, Villa-
nova; Wyatt, Tenn.; Kavanaugh, L.S.U., and Young of Oklahoma.
Wolffe of Santa Clara, Voights, Nebraska; Stoll of Calif., and Boyd
of Texas A. & M. are all capable tackles. The guard standouts
for the year include Smith of U.S.C., Zitrides from Dartmouth,
Slivinski of Washington and Stoll of Calif. There is an array of
fine backs and any of the following are possible first-stringers:
McLeod of Dartmouth, Brunner of Tulane, Stebbins and Cassiano
of Pitt, Lain from Rice, O’Brien of T.C.U., Bottari from Calif.,
Todd of Texas A&M, and Buhler of Minn.

When a player makes an All-American team picked by the better-
known writers, it does not ‘necessarily mean or show that he the
BEST man in the country for the position. The thing that makes a
player an All-American Publicity naturally given in
greater quantity to larger schools with the outstanding teams but that

is publicity. is
still doesn't show that’ the players on these teams are better than the
Stars of smaller schools. We have backs and linemen in the: Carolinas
that are good players, possibly as good as some that will make the first
team selections, but they will receive nothing better than an honorable
mention. What coach could ask for a better backfield than,one with
Tipton, O'Mara, Stirnweiss and Rooney in it. These boys behind a line
like Pitt boasts would do just as good as the Goldbergs, Cassianos, Steb-
bins and Chickerenos, but wan't make the All-American
simply because they don't rate the publicity that Pitt’s backs do.
Best scoring play of the year: as told to be an actual fact by
one of the members of the student body. Two high school teams
were battling it out for honors and neither team had been able to
score. During the half the coach instructed one of the players to
carry the first-down chain the next half and gave him other in-
structions. Soon after the second half started this same coach sent
10 players into the game and the eleven men on the field came off.
The player carrying the chain made sure that he was inside the out
of bounds line making him the eleventh man on the field. These
ten players lined up and the fullback received the ball from center |
and faded back to toss a long sideline pass. The man carrying the |
line, after dropping the chain, scooped up the ball and waltzed 75
yards untouched to score the lone touchdown of the game. Sounds |
logical anyway.
