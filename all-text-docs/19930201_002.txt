ace Offers Insight —
for Young Teachers

By Shaye Benton

Did you hug your Economics
teacher in the stands when the
Davidson soccer team made it to
the Final Four? Have you read
alongside your English professor
in the library, or ordered a coke at
the Soda Shop for both yourself
and your cellular biology profes-

“sor? The advantages of attending
a liberal arts institution benefit us
as students; yet these same experi-
ences are special in the eyes of our
teachers as well. The “Davidson
Experience” for the professor is
unique when compared, for ex-
ample, tothe “University of Florida
Experience” in that a liberal arts
environment provides the teacher
with an opportunity to know the
students on a first name basis, to
listen to their ideas, and to sit with
them at a soccer game.

Dr. Tony Abbott, Professor of
English, reflects on the small col-
lege teaching environment in two
chapters he contributed to a recent
book entitled The Arts and Politics
of Teaching: A Practical Guide for
the Beginning Professor. The book
is one of a series of three edited by
a group from the University of
Nebraska department of education.
The purpose of the books is to
describe different aspects of the
teaching profession and to serve as
guides for new teachers or those
interested in this career. Abbott
knows one of the editors, Keith W.

Prichard, from ‘pradtate Sthoof at *

Harvard and was asked to contrib-
ute to this first book as well as the
second.

In his chapter “Teaching in a
Small Liberal Arts College” Abbott
compares the expectations of the

small college with those of the
large university and describes nec-
essary skills needed by a young
teacher. The priorities of the two
types of schools are different, as
liberal arts colleges tend to mini-
mize pressure to research and pub-
lish, (which is necessary for suc-
cess at a university), and to stress
that the student comes first.
Abbott’s second chapter provides
useful information for a new
teacher in organizing a thorough,
realistic, and interesting course.
Abbott asked several other
Davidson faculty members to re-
view his chapter and remarked that
it“represents the thinking of many
wise heads here at Davidson.”

Abbott believes that the high
teaching standards of Davidson are
reflected in his chapters, and that
Davidson serves as a kind of “‘na-
tional symbol.” Abbott said, “At
Davidson teaching is so
important....the best teachers are
there because they are interested
particularly in the students and not
scholarship.” Abbott writes that
teachers in a liberal arts college
“instruct students not only in aca-
demic skills butin qualities of mind
and heart and humane values.” ‘In
order to accomplish these goals
the teacher must concentrate on
the student foremost.

So the next time you’re hav-
ing class in your psychology
teacher’s den, or sitting by your

sor ata Spring baseball game, think
about the experience as being
memorable for both parties; our
teachers are getting as much out of
their “Davidson Experience” as we
are.

Student Legislature Gearing
Up for 56th Annual Session

By Anni Kirkland

The North Carolina Student
Legislature has met every year for
the last fifty-five years in the Old
State Capital Building in Raleigh
to debate legislation written by its
members. Thecompletely student-
run organization seeks to educate
college students in the legislative
process through a hands-on expe-
rience of writing and debating leg-
islation.

Over the years, NCSL has
passed legislation privatizing the
prisons of N.C., reformed the health
care system, abolished: the elec-
toral college, passed the motor-
voter bill, and most recently,
granted civil rights to homosexu-
als. All measures passed by the
students are then sent on to state
and national representatives to in-
form them of students’ views.

Throughout the rich history of
the oldest student legislature in the
country, the Annual Session has
been the pivotal and most antici-
pated event. Delegations from
about twenty colleges state-wide
will convene from March 24-28 as
the House of Representatives and

“the Senate, complete with billcom-
mittees, Executive Officers, clerks,
and sergeants-at-arms.

During their stay in Raleigh,

delegates will meet the members
of the North Carolina State Legis-
lature ina Legislative Reception in
the Capital Building, as well as
hear addresses from prominent
politicians in the state. Any under-
graduate in the state may partici-
pate - in fact, the organization is
actively recruiting new members
and schools all the time.

This year, the Davidson Del-
egation is preparing for whatprom-

ises to be an unforgettable Session..

Davidson will be represented by
Anni Kirkland ’95 as Speaker Pro

Extra Exam Periods
and a Future Easter Break .

By Jennifer Humphrey

Beginning this semester stu-
dents now have six days (eleven
periods) instead of the previous
five days (ten periods) to take
their self-scheduled exams. This
addition came after the SGA
Council on Academic Affairssent
a letter to the Faculty Executive
Committee (FEC) expressing the
general sentiment that five days
was too brief a period that not
only caused more stress, but also
overcrowding in Chambers. The
FEC finalized the 1994-95 sched-
ule over the break and also in-
cluded another day with one more
exam period to the already ap-
proved calendars for this Spring
and next year. The faculty then
approved this change.

- An additional exam day
means that the last day of exams
this spring will be on Wednesday,
May 12, Next year the last day of
exams will be Thursday, Decem-
ber 23 in the Falland Wednesday,
May 18 in the Spring. Part of the
reason that next year’s semesters
end later than this year is due to
the fact that the FEC and faculty
wish to start later in August.

_ Thefaculty alsoapproved the
calendar for the 1994-95 school
year. Classes begin on August 29
and the last day of exams i is De-
cember 22) There are also two

breaks in the Spring. The faculty
approved along weekend coincid-
ing with Easter (Easter Monday
and the following Tuesday are holi-
days) as well as the regular week-
long spring break. This new Easter
break will not go into effect until
the Spring of 1995.
