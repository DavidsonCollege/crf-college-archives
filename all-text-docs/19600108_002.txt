Absolute Academic Freedom
As A Shield For Communism

It is good for Davidson to offer
courses in economic systems and com-
parative religions so that students
may study and weigh the merits of
those systems employed by others.

These are signs of a healthy atmos-
phere of academic freedom so impera-
tive for a liberal arts education.

There is a point, however, at which
academic freedom becomes more of
a liability than an asset to an educa-
tional community.

That point is reached when acade-

mic freedom becomes a menace to our
human freedoms. That point is reach-

ed when the Association of American
University Professors denies that af-
filiation with the Communist party is
reason for exclusion from the aca-
demic. profession.

The AAUP is to the education field
what the AFL-CIO is to industry; and
it has been almost as successful as the
union in bringing recalcitrants into
line, coercing colleges and univer-
sities into accepting its curious stand-
ards of academic freedom.

It cannot be denied the professors’
“union” has had its success due to the
distinguished list of educators on its
roll. It is firmly established.

We feel, however, that they have
made academic freedom a fetish —
that they regard it as an absolute end

Critic of What--
Free Journalism?

The Rev. Frank Hall’s career as a
merits the “letters to the editor’’ priv-
ilege he wonders about in his letter
on this page. Disagreement with edi-
torial. policy is as old as the Fourth
Estate, and is recognized as indispen-
sible to a free press.

Reader Hall has not, however, dis-
agreed explicitly with our policy,
thougS the implication is obvious. He
has limited his talents to disagreeing
with our right to present our policy in
each instance. He says, “It’s entirely
proper... to be wrong sometimes.
But not wrong in the wrong direc-
tion!’ Perhaps due to our undergrad-
uate naivete we have failed to grasp
the paths of absolute right and wrong
which seem to have been so lucidly
revealed to the Rev. Hall.

If it is “entirely proper” for us to
be wrong in advocating his ideas, why
is it “unutterably sad” for us to ad-
vance our ideas? May we speak only
for that of which he approves?

By the way, we, too, are crusaders.
We have been fighting for liberaliz-
ed cuts, ennumerated reforms in the
admissions systems and the individual
in a society of collectivism, among
other things.

Concerning Harry Golden, we nev-
er ‘elucidated” his errors. A closer
reading of the December 4 editorial
will show that we questioned his au-
thority as “spokesman for the South”,
never his ability as a writer.

Finally, it’s a bit unusual for us to
be called “stuffy”, but we’re glad to
know we can be forgiven if we are
shocking.

and not as a means to an end—unin-
terested in the fact that their precious
academic freedom can serve as a
shield behind which commuaists hide,
with countenance, and advocate doc-
trines clearly aimed. at our overthrow.

We believe that truth should be the
end and academic freedom the means
to find that end.

Neither we, nor our society, accepts
the doctrine of communism, includ-
ing its denial of God, as a truth.

Our free society should not have to
tolerate, nor should our students be
indoctrinated by, those who will not
disavow communism. :They threaten
our human freedom—which we stand
to lose to communism.

There is no longer any reasonable
doubt that the members of the Com-
munist party are part of a conspiracy
to overthrow the U. S. government by
force if necessary.

The evidence that communists are
unfit to teach in a*free society is over-
whelming to most clear thinking
Americans—but not to the AAUP.

We believe in a healthy academic

freedom, but not as an absolute, not

when it shields communists to teach
a doctrine of menace to each of us
under the banner of absolute aca-
demic freedom raised high by the
American Association of University
Professors.

the Library which we are very anxi-
ous to clear up. The article incorrect-
ly stated that the Lebrary made it
current policy to decline all books
willed to the school. This is not true.

There are some instances in which
we are left books that are of little
value to the undergraduate liberal
arts college, or are out-of-date with-
out being old enough to be valuable
for their age. These books we are
forced to refuse because of the high
price of transporting: books and pre-
paring them for the stacks. Some-
times the books are not appropriate
to the institution or do not suit the
professors’ purposes.

However, we Presbyterians are not

known for looking a gift horse in the
mouth. We realize that we do ‘not
have enough books in the library; and
we do accept books by will (and other
gratis methods). We are glad to get
them.

Changing Times
And Preaching

In an address to the Literary So-
cieties of Davidson College in 1838,
the Rev. James H. Thornwell said:

“Whatever position may be taken
on the naked question of slavery,
the principles of the Abolitionists
strike at the foundation of all so-
cial order, and under the peculiar
aspect of things in this country
their carrying out into actual prac-
tice must be attended with terrible
convulsions and bloody wars. And
if their leveling propensities should
gradually bring them to the hated
doctrine of amalgamation, reason,
religion and humanity as well as
decency and taste would turn away
in disgust from the sickening cli-
max of outrageous fanaticism.”

change. 2

TIME FOR NEW YEAR’S RESOLUTIONS—

a

Commencement Speech, 1874,
Reveals Southemer’s Fiery Zeal

(Editor’s Note: These excerpts are taken front a
commencement address delivered by a member of the _
Philanthropic Society in 1874. it was recently submit-
ted by a Davidson alumnus who found it among some
old papers.) oo

Gn’ the pending ‘‘civil rights” legislation of the
Reconstruction Congress:

«“_ , how. can the most careful teacher prevent
the debasing influence of Negro children, scarcely
emerged from African fetishism? They will fill the minds
of their pale-faced associates with weird stories and
foolish netions, from which they never recover; worse
still—they will corrupt their young hearts by evil com-
munications of the biackest dye!

“Hence, no more effectual method could have
been adopted for closing the school house, that nursery
of all national intelligence, against the poor, diligent
white man. .. Hence, the result will be to expend the
whole public fund for the slow brains of Ham’s descen-
dants and leave the bright intellects of nature’s gifted
children in gross ignorance.”

On coeducation in institutions of higher learning:

... Oftentimes when we go into the recitation room
and the piercing eye of the Professor falls upon us; it
seems to us that he sees everything that we do not know;
now, gentlemen, if you add another pair of glancing
eyes, sitting opposite to each one of us, and looking us
through and through, you must, honored sirs, place the

failing point lower than 60—for our sakes!.

“Shall we take gold as an agent in getting iron
from the rude ore? Shall the sweet and sacred influ-
ence of girlish modesty, all be supplanted by a brazen
forwardness at these colleges and universities in order
that the lazy faculties of great rough boys be develop-
ed? No. No! Establish Rugby schools and Oxfords, and

need be; but give us no more Cornells, or Oberlins,

or Antiochs . .

Robinson Offers Evaluation at First Semester’s End;
Calls For Examination, Critique of Campus Life

The coming of a new year
is‘ a time appropriate at least
for cvaluating some of the
campus activities of the pre-
vious Fall, if not for new reso-

lutions. The evaluating  re-
marks that follow will seem
highly presumptuous unless

they are taken for what they
are, simply personal reflec-
tions.

LIFE UNRELATED

Extra-curricular life at David-
son continues to be essentially
unrelated to the educational
purpose of the college. Many
organizations seem to have lit-
tle fundamental understanding
of their purpose, and little will-
ingness to question that pur-
pose: if known. The relation-
ships among organizations are
poorly defined.

For some areas of interest,
such as debate. and drama, there
are few or no organizational
outlets. Among. the specifically
religious institutions of the
campus there is a marked in-.
ability to combine worship and
commitment with a strong etbi-

cal concern.

CONTRIBUTIONS
Several groups are apparent-
ly making ‘new and significant

contributions to student life.
The International Relations
Club has provided a much need-
ed emphasis on African affairs
throughout the first semester.

Denominational fellowships
are broadening the scope of
their activities. The Westmin-
ster Fellowship has examined
“powerful beliefs” and the
racial question; the Methodist
Youth Fellowship has been at-
tempting to relate the Christian
faith to such areas as jazz and
the work of the United Nations;
and the Canterbury Club has
madz significant studies in
drama and existentialism.

The. Inter-Varsity Fellowship
continues to possess a quality
of fellowship and fervor which
other religious institutions tend
to de-emphasize in their at-
tempts to make faith relevant
to life.

IFS SHOWS CONCERN

The IFC appears to have a
broader concern than it has
shown in some past years. The
independents have been includ-
ed in both the activities and
interest of the council. The
council has given consideration
to: community service projects
and fraternity retreats. °

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Nevertheless, the fraternities
themselves continue to mold
rather than furnish a flexible
program for their individual
members. They are making lit-
tle effort to integrate their
work with the educational aims
of the college; the visit of Sen.
Ervin was a notable exception
to this. A larger number than
usual of the freshmen seems to
have some basic questions about
the quality of fraternity life.

Y EXPANDS

The Y has expanded its pro-
gram to include such valuable
activities as the Book-of-the-
Semester. The depth of its
work, however, does not mea-
sure up to its breadth. The pro-
gram is poorly integrated and
lacks continuity.

The leadership does not seem
to have a very’ clear perception
of what a campus YMCA should
do. The denominational fellow-
ships continue to do a steadier
and more thorough job than the
Y.

BELOW PAR
The Student Council and
Davidsonian have served less
well than they might have serv-
ed. The former group still needs
to gain an identity as a legisla-

tive and representative body.

It has made significant ef-
forts to relate to student life
only in the area of alcohol. It
seems to me that the council
should become the petition-cir-
culating and rabble - rousing
group which focuses and fo-
ments campus opinion.

VOICE WASTED

The newspaper has dealt ful-
ly and significantly only with
the cut system; even in this
treatment it retreated from its
original stand. The remainder
of its voice has been either em-
ployed in ‘defensive supports of
the status quo or wasted on less
important questions. The ap-
pearance of “The Iconoclast”
was partially a commentary on
the Davidsonian‘s ineffective-
ness,

The lethargy and dissatisfac-
tion of members of the college
community seems to be at least
as great as it has been in past
years. These two attitudes prob-
ably help to explain the unre.
latedness and_ ineffectiveness
of much of extra-curricular
life.

Trustee Hits Paper’s Policy; Marrotte Clears

Dr. Hall

Dear Editor:

I don’t know whether I rate
“letter to the editor” privileges
or not. I am Davidsonian by
heredity, choice, and conviction:
an alumnuf& the son of an
alumnus, the father of-a cur-
rent student, and a member of
that suspect and devious organi-
zation, the Board of Trustees.

in extenuation of the lat-
ter, 1! am also a veteran mem-
ber of the Blue Pencil Chap-
ter of Sigma Upsilon, helped
edit Davidson student pub-
lications in the dim deys
when Noah was drying off,
kept Wilson McCutchan from
flunking sophomore English,
and now write a weekly (you
may spell it either way you
wish) column for the Wil-
mington newspapers.

All of which means that I
read the Davidsonian with more

than ordinary interest. But I
am weary of the constant snap-
ping of the Editor's Gene Tal-
madge suspenders. And I can-
not help remembering that
membership in the Daughters
of the American Revolution was
not always a prerequisite for
Davidson writers. ”

We were sometimes cru-
saders, but youthfully and |
think healthfully — radical,
never the champions of tired
and fretful reaction,

Somehow, seeing the David-
sonian become the propagan-
da organ of apartheid, racism,
and fear makes me unutter-
ably sad.

It’s entirely proper for a col-
lege paper to espouse forlorn
hopes and causes not yet come
to popularity, even to be wrong
sometimes. But not to be wrong
in the wrong direction! Youth
ean afford to be too far in
front, but not to retreat into the
fossilized wastes of a dead day.

My fine! gripe is that sub-
sophomoric attack on Harry
Golden. (it reminds me of
thet other little boy enamor-
ed of big words, who, answer-
ing a history quiz on Pompeii,
wrote: “Pompeii was destroy-
ed by an eruption of saliva
from the vatican.”

Can’t you see how funny it
is for a college editor to eluci-
date the errors of a really great
writer, and to do it so pontific-
ally? I know Harry finds it very
amusing indeed. When the
grasshopper bites the dragon it
only tickles.

Life will be a lot more fun
if we don’t take ourselves so
seriously. A college news-
paper can be forgiven for be-
ing shocking, but to be stuffy
is the unforgivable sin.

Yours for a twentieth cen-
tury Davidson,

B. Frank Hall,

Dr. Marroffe

Dear Editor:

In view of the recent publi-
city which has been given to
the use of. a loyalty oath and

non-communist affidavit in con--

nection with the government
loans to students, I would like

to refer once again to the action
of the Davidson chapter of the
American Association of Uni-

versity Professors in February
1959.

The following resolution
was adopted by the unani-
mous vote of the members
present at this particular
mesting. The number of
votes cast was not recorded.
However, the total member-
ship in the Davidson AAUP
chapter at the time was forty-
four, all but one of whom
was an active member of the
Davidson Colege faculty.

We respectfully request that
the resolution in full and this
accompanying letter be re-
printed in the DAVIDSONIAN:

campus community’ is not very
strong. When communication
occurs, as was the case when
the Board of Visitors came, it
is usually about such less
significant questions as, “How

can we better sbll the Davidson
image?”

There is little basic criticism
and debate, and even less en-
couragement of them. Students
can see little evidence of ad-
ministrative leadership and ini-
tative; it is difficult to point
out exactly where. the leader-
ship of the college as a whole
rests, ‘

TROUBLED CONSCIENCE

Perhaps at the root of all the
disquietude is a troubled camp-
us conscience; we do not really

believe that the creatureliness

of man, the search for truth,
and the Christian faith can be
effectively related to one anoth-
er.

We fear that one of our tin
gods will clatter and fall if
examined too closely, upheld
too fully, or viewed in the light
of his rival deities; Thus, we
give partial allegiance to each
god, and suffer from the re-
sulting frustration.

Oath Stand

“Whereas, the National De-
fense Education Act of 1958
singles out unfairly persons
in education as objects of
suspicion; and

“Whereas, loyalty oaths are
repugnant to the traditions
of academic freedom in our
country; therefore

“Resolved, That the David-
son College Chapter of the
American Association of Uni-

versity Professors assembled
in meeting on February 3,
1959, go on record as urging
the repeal by Congress of
the provision of the National
Defense Education Act which
denies payments or loans to
any individual who does not
file an affidavit with the
Commissioner of Education
declaring that he does not be-
lieve in, and is not a member
of, and does not support any
organization that believes in
or teaches the overthrow of
the United States Govern-
ment by force or violence or
by any illegal or unconstitu-
tional methods,”

I might point out that the
Davidson chapter of the AAUP
has not been at all concerned
with the advisability of receiv-
ing or rejecting the govern-
ment loans to students, but only
with the principle involved in
requiring the oath and affidavit
of the students.
