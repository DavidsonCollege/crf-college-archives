EDITORIAL.

—— —!

MIS-STATEMENTS CORRECTED.

Either wilfully and maliciously, — or
through pure ignorance, there appears to
be a strong tendency on the part of the
staff and editorial columns of the “Game-
cock,” the paper published by the Uni-
versity of South Carolina, to wander;
from the path of carrect statements, in
regard to the Davidson-Carolina cancel-
lation.

If the case was one of “ignorance,”
as we would like to believe it is, we
would like to make certain corrections,
and we feel that the above mentioned
paper should make such corrections in
their columns.

The statement is made that Davidson
wanted South Carolina to play a S, 1.
A. A. team: for which the contract. did
not call. No such demand was made,
and only a team was wanted which could
come under their own rules.

The statement is also made that
“Davidson had every fact upon which to
base their requests, two weeks before the
contest.” Yet the true status of the case
is that it was only after a ‘phone request
on the day before the game was sched-
uled, that the Davidson authorities were
able to get anv kind of list of men, and
this list could not be O.K.'d by any,
member of the faculty of South Caro-
lina.

Furthermore, it is stated that “The
University outhorities have shown that
they wished to play Davidson under
1915 rules.” This is such a plain error
that it would seem that it could at least
have been avoided. For twenty minutes
at one time, over the long distance
*phone. the request was made time after
time that the University abide by the
contract and play under these rules, but
this they would not do.

The statement was also made that
“Athletic relations had heen severed
with Davidson.” If this is true, there
has been no official notification of this
fact, and unless the South Carolina au-
thorities are so busy investigating the
standing of their plavers that they do not
have time to properly notify the David-
son authorities of an action of this kind.
we are inclined to believe that such
action will at least be deferred until the
faculty of the University of South Caro-
lina have an opportunity to apologize to
Davidson for attempting to use players
against them who were not eligible.

While Davidson always enjoys a con-
test with an institution several times its
own size, and is proud of the many vic-

the men who make her teams are bona
fide students in every sense of the word,
and there is never a doubt as to their
eligibility.

We regret that it has been necessary "
to make these corrections, and no further “QO 4
notice will be given to an incident which ulps & Cranks
is already closed. “The memory only re-
mains and it will be many Jong days be-
fore the public will forget the facts re-
garding the University of South Caro-
lina athletics which have been revealed
within the past few weeks.

Dr. Melton Clark. father of Wood-
row Clark ('18) ,addressed the Y. M.
C. A., Thursday night. His subject was
“What Should Guide a Man in the
Choice of His Life’s Work?” Men
make the most important decisions of life
before they are twenty-five. The aim
has a vital connection with the end.
First, Profit is to he considered. It is
the lowest but the fundamental consid-
eration, The best profit is that which
comes not immediately but in the far
future. Next to be considered is Power.
“Not how T can get most power, but
how can T best develop the power in me,
and hest give it out.” One must give
his best to God. though it necessitates
the burving of his life.

Dr. Clark spoke impressively to a
large, attentive crowd.

SPECIAL INVITATION TO ALL.

THE CAROLINA ‘TRACT MEET.

Recently an invitation was received
from the Athletic Association of the
University of North Carolina to com-
nete in a four-mile cross country run.
Davidson has never been in for anything
of this kind before, yet several men are
thinking about making the trip. It is
entirely a voluntary affair, and whoever
goes must stand the expenses of this
trip, since it will not be under-the super-
vision of the Athletic Association.
