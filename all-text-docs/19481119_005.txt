was the margin of victory

the most evenly matched for locals season,

possibly the Woftord scrap. The Presbyterians looked their
best since their early season bout with William and Mary.

Davidson’s season record now stands at two wins, five
losses and a tie. Victories came over Elon in the season’s

opener and a family ned over The Citadel. Though the de-
feats to State and VMI were pretty decisive, a break here and
there could have turned the other three victories. Two
long“passes spelled the decision for the powerful William and
Mary Indians who tied Carolina and are now headed for the
New Year’s Day Dixie Bowl],in Birmingham.

The Southern Conference tussle with Furman gives the
locals their last chance to shaw their wares this year. With the
same brand of ball displayed last week, it could mean win
number three for Davidson. We look for it.
