THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 4, 1933

SILVER SCREEN

Wednesday, Oct. 4—Broadway to Hol-
lywood

Frank Morgan and Alice Brady are
the couple who make the climb from
small vaudeville up to the screen, and
end up by making a success. They
start at the very bottom, and are shown
through all the hard struggles, and all
the back-stage information given
proves very interesting. The hopes,
the glories, the discouragements and
finally the successes of the pair are
shown, going on into-the second and
third generations, showing their chil-
dren and their grandchildren carrying
on the tradition of the stage. Madge
Evans, Eddie Quillan, and Russel Har-
die are very well as the grandcinidren.
The Albertina Rasch dancing girls add
much entertainment to the show.

Thursday, Oct. 5—Midshipman Jack

This picture shows Bruce Cabot in
an entirely new role, that of a midship-
man in the Navy. He is very good as
the young seaman, and fits the role
well. He stars with Betty Furness,
who is one of the newest young girls
on the screen. She is very good in
the picture, which should be very en-
tertaining.

Friday, Oct. 6—No picture has been
billed for this date.

Saturday, Oct..7—The Woman I Stole

One of the newest pictures to be re-
leased, starring Jack Holt. He seems
to be getting away from™most of his
rough tactics, and becoming the great
lover, With him are Fay Wray,as
his leading lady, and Racquel Torres
and Noah Beery, making the picture
very interesting.

Monday and Tuesday, Oct. 9-10—
Deluge

Another very unusual picture, put-
ting fancy into fact by having the
greater part of the world destroyed
by an earthquake, and showing what
happens to the people remaining on
the earth. It is astounding in the ex-
cellent photography, and the queer
things pictured in such a-state of the
world. Peggy Shannon and Lois Wil-
son are very good in their parts, and

make the situations seem almost real.

Ministerial Band Has
Election of Officers

Herbert Lucas, New President,
Speaks on “Social Problems”

The Ministerial Band, which is an
organization composed of those stu-
dents who are candidates for the min-
istry of the gospel, held a meeting last
Thursday night and elected the follow-
ing officers: Herbert Lucas, president;
Murphy Smith, vice-president; William
Benfield, secretary and treasurer.

Herbert Lucas presided over the
meeting, while Murphy Smith had
charge of the devotional. Woodrow
Thrower made a very interesting talk
on “Social Problems,” while Ellis

Oakes talked on» “Conformity to the |

Likeness of God.” After these talks,
Sam Wiley summarized these talks and
gave some very helpful suggestions to
the ministerial students.

The band holds its meetings every
second and fourth Thursday nights
during the month,

All Freshmen’ who are candidates
for the ministry are automatically
members 67 this band, and are cor-
dially invited to attend the next meet-
ing which is to be held the second
Thursday night in this month.

Renowned Marksman
Gives Demonstration

Gives Fancy and Plain Shooting
Exhibition in Mooresville

Mr. M. E. Hicks, world-famous
marksman, gave a free exhibition of
plain and fancy shooting last Thurs-
day afternoon at the Mooresville show
grounds,

A large crowd was in attendance to
see the exhibition, which included a
number of difficult feats with revolver,
rifle, and shotgun. A lecture was also
given on the practical and safe meth-
ods of using firearms. Mr. Hicks dem-
onstrated how to develop marksman-
ship, and how to become an expert
shot.

The purpose of this free program
was to prove the accuracy and effici-
ency of Peter’s ammunition.

Bill Cox Is Winner -
Of Frosh Cake Race

In the annual Freshman cake race |

held last Thursday over the mile and
seven-tenths course, Cox won in the
slow time of eleven minutes and forty
seconds. Last year Frazier broke the
college record in this race with a time
of.nine minutes, thirty-five and five-
tenths seconds.

This race is held every year in or-

‘der to discover prospects for the
|Freshman track team. Coach Whittle
jhas asked that all the men that com-

“|peted in the cake race to report out

for track as soon as possible.

All the boarding houses donated
cakes as prizes for the first twenty-
three men that finished in the race.
The men that won the cakes are listed
in the order in which they finished in
the “contest: Cox, Feuchtenberger,
Scott, Wilson, Allen, Brown, Peters,
Dyerle, Lafferty, Knorr, Mack, Mof-
fett, H. Woodward, L. E. Woodward,

drews, S. E. Eaton, Bivens, V. Hig-
gins, Edwards.

Circus to Be Shown

Ringling and Barnum and Bailey
Combined Exhibiting in Char-
lotte on Jubilee Tour

The Ringling Brothers and Barnum

and Bailéy combined circus, on its
Golden Jubilee tour, will exhibit in
Charlotte on October 12. CY

Outstanding among the Jubilee fea-
tures is the mighty spectacle, The
Dunbar, gorgeous, dazzling, be-jew-
eled reproduction of India’s great cor-
onation ceremonial at Delhi, where
thousands of potentates with their
royal elephants and huge oriental
tetinues parade for the pleasure of the
newly crowned ruler of Great Brit-
ain and India, their vast wealth sym-
bolized by gem-studdéd trappings on
elephants and horses, by their native
forces and lavishly garbed households.
Over two thousand people and animals
take part in the Dunbar, and itg back-
ground is opulent and bizarre with
imported Hindu temples, tongas, carved
gold cars and royal howads. The
Dunbar isthe proud achievement of
the Ringling “Brothers and Barnum
and Bailey combined circus on its
Golden Jubilee tour, and-it heads a list
of features newly assembled that will
compel the vast five-ring, four-stage
program to be recalled with deep
pleasure for a lifetime.

CAMPUS IS SCENE OF
FRANTIC ’CAT SPIRIT

(Continued from page 1)
on the Gridgraph by lights and a mov-
ing electric “ball.”

The historic walls of Shearer Hall
rang with the fervor and excitement
of college yells and songs, all of which
presented to the football team a spirit
which could hardly be forgotten. It
was the traditional spirit of Davidson
manifested in a stirring outburst of
zeal and devotion.

At the conclusion of the yells, which
were led by Hugh Hawkins and the
assistant cheerleaders, the students be-
gan a shirt-tail parade around the cam-
pus. To the cry of “shirt tails out,
freshmen,” the parade, led by the band,
made its way down Dormitory Row,
past the stadium, around the south
end of the campus, and came to a halt
in. front of Chambers Building in the
center of the campus, Here a few
more yells were given, and the foot-
ball frolic was disbanded,
