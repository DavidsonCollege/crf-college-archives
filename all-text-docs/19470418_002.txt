Policy

A new statf has-fallen heir to the voice
of Davidson,yand we that staff feel
obliged at the outset to present to the
student body, the administration, the
alumni, and interested aftiliates of our
college the policy to which we subscribe
and the goal for which we aim.

The Dazidsonian hot just a news
organ for the campus, although this is its
established primary purpose for existence;
it further rerpesents to the “outside world”
Davidson College itself, and therein lies
a heavy responsibility. Through exchange
with other college journals, alumni and
parent subseription, and various
ures through the mail by students, our
Weekly newspaper is circulated widely
throughout the South and to lesser degree
the upper states. With this fact before us,
we who are responsible for thecontents of
the Davidsonian, will strive to publish a
newspaper which willfepresent thesgreat-
est possible number of Davidson students
and Davidsohactivities and which will be
of interest to the number of
readers.

The new staff and the retiring staffare
of one opinion as concerns the two great-
est faults of our post-war Dazidsoniait
thus, far—it has been written by and for a
small minority within the student body,
and often times it has been a vehicle for
veiled humor which when unveiled was
found to bea shade or two off the Davidson
color, The first fault would stem from
the general lack of willingness of students
to devote time and effort to campus pub-

licattens, which has been an oft-aired
‘rievance all year. Some will trace this
“sinterested attitude toward “extracur-

to the returned Wweterans who,
contend, are interested only in grad-

tng from college in the minimum. a-

‘mt of time with the maximum. amount

‘Gisure. This is perhaps not the case,

more likely this disappointing lack of
ticipation in all ¢ campus activities arises

/an inherent evil in a necéssarily over-
crowded sttident bedy with sucha wide age
differentiation, What ever’ the cause or
whatever the solution to this problem, the
newspaper cannot be a true campus re-
presentative. until there is rejuvenated
campus-wide active interest in it.

The second defect and the one which
has rightly received criticism from many
quarters, the sunken humor cached thro-
ughout- most of our previous issues, was
due to the work of a small group of
veterans. (among them the new editor) who
were too interested in trying to generate
a few laughs, all at the expense-of —un-
suspecting innocents and to the detriment
of the paper. This type of writing was
not asked for or desired by the Heung
editors,” Ed Sutton and Jim Love, but
with the shortage of men and material
that faced them each Monday night, they
had little choice but to print the stories
they received from the above mentioned
group. Our predecessors have left us, thro-
ugh their hours of toil and tears,
better organized staff, agd secondly an
admonition to steer cleaf™of. the innuendo
if we are to continue the building toward
a good Davidsonian, for which they hz ive
left us a firm foundation.

Tennis Courts

On a recent afternoon, which seemed
to be especially suitable for playing ten-
niss.the ratio of prospective players to
the nttmber of courts available was ap-
proximately 10 to 1. Of course the after-
noon had something to do with. this situa-

tion, but on this afternoon three of the
courts which are normally restricted to
varsity. use, were open to anyone who
wished to play on them™I{f these varsity

courts had not been available, the ratio
would have been almost 15 toh

At the present time there dre seven
courts*which are always open to-all mem-
bers of the student: body’ With the enroll.
ment of the college up to over nine hun-fs
dred students, this does not even provide
one court for every hundred men. It
apparent that something needs to be done
about this, and the only solution that pre-
sents itself to me is for the school to'con-
struct some more courts. If this is not done
there will continue to be a large number of
men who would like to play tennis and
cannot because there are not enough courts
for everyone.

Perhaps someone will question the ulti-
mate good of students being able to play
tennis, but do they look at the fact that

lives, I do not mean to belittle the good
of other, organized athletics, because we
all realize the good that our whole athletic
program does for both the students and
the college. It seems that a school like
Davidson, which obviously tries to give
its students as many things as possible
which they can use in later life, should tr y

The courts to which the student body
as.a whole has access are not only very few
in number, but they are in rather poor

worn) from most of them but it is not
entirely gone yet. The seven lower courts
not only need the grass taken off entirely,
but they need rolling, as the only* pac king
which they have had to date is that furn-

on them.

whom I have talked, that a school of this

In the spring a Wildeat’s fancy
lightly turns .. . sorry, friends,
to have to begin with this monu-
ment to triteness, but it can™bést
serve to introduce a few offhand
observations occasioned by the
and the season which, as
no other, turns a young man’s ete.
to things ’n’ stuff. And so shall we
turn, that is? .. ¢ First of
all there is the amazing news that
the United States government Mas
finally recognized the true worth
of the community of Davidson in
using for national de-
fense. After several years of study
of various cefiters of the nation as
to their_respective aquatic potenti-
alities, the government has proved
that Davidson is consistently the
most inundated community of this
country, barring none. In accord-
ance with their wishes to move
atomic bomb underwater éxperi-
ments closer hame they have
chosen Davidson as the next test-
ing ground for the Navy’s subma-
rine tests of effects of the bomb
on the under parts of certain types
of new craft. It is expected that
the tests will be conducted in the
golf course area so as to avoid the
dangers that the bomb might pro-
duce. An official Navy spokesman
has been quoted as saying that the
perfect spot, the quadrangle be-
tween Chambers and Georgia, had
to be bypassed much to the regret
of the experimenters,

Heads naturally are urged in the
direction of the front campus’ Fer-
tilizer Furrow, but the aquiline pro-
tuberance benath the eyes is main-
ly responsible for the attendance
in that direction. It is odd that
with all the other flowers that
bloom in the spring, tra la! another
fragrance should be required to
make complete the college boy’s
nasal pleasures...But ours not to
reason why, ours but to sniff and

the recent influx of tennis matches
has caused a great spontaneity~of
gaze in the vicinity of the green
courts every afternoon,” The in-
firmary reports that_a great quan-

of the matter is that the occur-
rence was not directly after a
week end. Dr. Woods plans to an-
hounce in the near future that a
course in eye-manipulation will be
‘offered to all interested” persons.

When Friday, today, and the

eighteenth are mentioned, all heads
are once again aligned in graceful
oider. All noses are pointed, by
the time this paper is supposedly
due, to the Armory-Auditorium, in
Charlotte wherein the annual
Spring Frolics will be conducted—
soon néw! Whether attracted by
groovy music, sentimental stuff,
merely the love of the terpsicho-
rean, or the fair faces of the fab-
ulous femmes, all are in complete
accord in the direction to be taken.
But then this last idea has led us
into our last and perhaps most
important turning point.

Be it on the Square in Charlotte
or on the campus (few though the
opportunities may be!) here in
Davidson, the Wildeat’s head is
never failing to turn at the sight of
aforementioned feminine  pulchri-
tude. So the old adage that heads
this corner, though trite, is as
true today as it was a century ago.
There’s, just something in the air
that won’t be denied, and few are
so foolish as to deny it. Thus the
flood away from hyar come the
looked-for week end by all concern-
ed, and who are we to be left be-
hind. Good-bye!

Dear Editor:

The recent student body elections
have precipitated a considerable
portion of campus conversations to
a styain of thought that is not
uncommon each year at this time.
The students begin to ask the ques-
tion, “Why shouldn’t we have cam-
paignsein the elections?” The an-
swe to this question is so obvious
that I am reluctant to undertake
such an easy task. Howeyer, I will
express my ideas in no round- about
way that may make such an easy
solution seem difficult to compre-
hend.

First of all, I would not take such
an absurd stand as to commit my-
self in favor of campaigns for stu-
dent body elections. Our country
ever since the date 1776 has been
built upon democratic principles
which have penertated to the very
simplest conditions of our lives.
Arguments between the youths of
our nation on the field of sports
have long been arbitrated on demo-
cratic principles; our clubs, fra‘?
ternities, Scout troops, and all other
organizations where controversy in-
evitably crops up, work on these
same principles. Therefore, why
should such an undemocratic prin-
ciple as the right of persuasion in
the form of free speech or adver-
tisement be- permitted to crawl
across our campus like the dragon
of despair ?

The’ most predominant ARTA
against the non-campaign elections
that are traditionally Davidson is
that many of the students do not
know the person for whom they
vote. Let me ask this question
Why should the students know the
candidates that are.running for of-
fice when their duties are insig-
nificant and inconsequential? They
never affect us or the college as
a whole and therefore it is of no
consequence to the student body
regardless of whom is holding the
office. It does not make any dif-
ference to us who gets up in chapel

to make the announcements or the

Letters To The Editor...

manner in which he presents them,
nor does it make any difference
who handles the money in the dif-
ferent classes, nor does it make any
difference who handles the affairs
of the Y, which does not have much
influence on campus. We should
worry whether Joe Blow. or Jack
Slotz gets his name spread across
the Davidsonian.

Some students have the gall to
say that it is bad training for our
future endeavors in the national
and_state-elections. of our-country.
in that if we disregard the candi-
date and what he stands for in col-
lege, we will have the same neglect-
ful tendency away from college.
It seems.to me that these students
have a fallacy in their premises.
Certainly the.majority of electors
in nationatand state ‘elections have
no idea, except by.name, who the
fellow is running for effice, so why
try to know them in school? There
is no sense in studying the candi-
date and his principles given in
his platform, because after all the
study and attempt to pick the best
candidate, he doesn’t get elected
anyway. They are usually elimi-
nated in thes,primary. We are
simply making something hard out
of something thaf is simple, be-
cause the way it’ is now,;—all-one
has to do is just see which name
Jooks the best, or which one strikes
a familiar chord in our brain and
check his name. Why go listen to
him speak or sce how he looks or
compare his qualities with another
when it is so simple now?

The way our elections are run
We
do not have to stay on campus to
help-in campaigns, or listen to
speeches, or take an interest in
them which in any way detains us
from going to Charlotte to the
Bamboo Room. We are going to
college to stay away from-the cam-
pus as much as possible. Why
should a man stay in the library
preparing a speech’ for his candi-

the annual Sig Ep Installation Ban-
quet was held at Thacker’s. Plenty
of cheese was on hand for “Mousey”
Winchester who provided the
“laughs”? Pat Clark of Clarkton,
North Carolina, was selected as the
fraternity’s most oustanding fresh-
man for the year. Immediately
following the banquet the “Dear
Brothers” and their dates adjourned
to the Red Fez Club to dance to
the music of Gid Todd and his or-
chestra. ‘Peanut-head” McLauch-
lin was very much in evidence with
his flash bulbs and Babie-Brownie
covering the local celebrities. Fred-
die Powell was with his one and

‘NOCTURNE”

This R.K.O. production deals with
the undying efforts of a young de-
tective, George Raft, to prove that
the death of a composer in his
studio is the result of murder and
not of suicide. It is an interesting
and exciting mystery, the interest
of which is added to by the sup-
porting actress, Lynn Bari. The
scenery is a little overdone in the
showing of lush scenes in Holly-
wood night clubs. There seems to
be a slight excess of fight scenes
for this type of picture but their
presence adds somewhat to the gen-
eral excitement. One of the out-
standing achievements in the direc-
tion of this picture is the superb
effect accomplished by the use of
the musical score;

“MY BROTHER TALKS TO
HORSES”

Very little information could be
obtained concerning this picture by
Metro- -Goldwyn-Mayer. As the title
indicates there.must be a horse or
two in it, not to mention the brother

who talks, The original story on
which the picture is based was car-
ried in the “Saturday Evening
Post” not very long ago. With such
an unusual name as this, the picture
is probably also unique and there-
fore it is likely to be interesting. It
may be in color and then again, it
may be in black and white. Never-
theless, two things I know; horses
and talking brother.

“IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE”

As unrealistic as it may seem
this production is probably as real-
istic (excluding Clarence, the angel)
as any that Hollywood produces,
Jimmy Stewart, although he has
planned-to go to the big city, is re-
quired to remain in his small home
town and run his father’s old build-
and loan association. Out of lack
of someone else, he marries Donna
Reed, a childhood sweetheart.
Things go badly for hits’ and he
wishes he were never born. It all
ends very happily as things return
to normal and he learns to really
appreciate life, This picture is truly

worth seeing.
