moment later. Davidson, 14; Clemson,
9. Davidson scored again in this period,
when, after the ball had been regained
from Clemson on Davidson's 1-yard line,
consistent line bucks worked it up to the
middle of the field, and Spann hurled a
perfect pass to Buck Flowers for a 20-
yard gain, and the All-Southern half-
back scurried thru the broken Clemson
team for the remaining 30 yards and a
third touchdown. Grey kicked goal.
Davidson, 21; Clemson, 9. And so the
game closed, altho Davidson threatened
once more to score in the last quarter,
failing only on account of the expiration
of time.

It was a final triumphant display of
Coach Fetzer’s superb forward — pass
plays, and a victory closing one of the
greatest season of Davidson football.
By defeating Clemson, the acknowledged
champions of South Carolina, Davidson
established herself as the champion of all
the Carolinas, and the best team, outside
of the wonderful Tech outfit, in the en-
tire South. Her season, which opened
with such dismal prospects, has been one
uninterrupted march of glory from the
date of the Y. M. IL. victory in Char-
lotte, and it was fitting that her winning
streak of six straight victories over the
best teams in the South should end where
it began, in Charlotte.

The game was played as follows:

toss and elected to defend the east goal.
