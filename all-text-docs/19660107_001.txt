Student Body, Faculty Overwhelmingly Back Viet Nam Policy

By JOHNNY CLARK
Davidsonian Associate Editor

Davidson students and faculty
overwhelmingly endorse current
U. S. involvement and policy in
Viet Nam, according to Tues-
day’s DAVIDSONIAN poll con-
cerning the most publicized na-
tional issue of the day.

The survey, answered by ap-
proximately one-half of the stu-
dent body and one-half of the

err ta

faculty, showed a general agree-
ment between the two groups,
with the faculty agreeing to only
a‘slight degree less than the stu-
dents with U. S. policy concern-
ing Viet Nam.

A high degree of Davidson con-
formity with national opinion
trends was also indicated by the
poll results in comparison with
a recent college survey taken

by Playboy.

per cent of the nation's college
students and 68 per. cent of the
nation’s college faculty members
favor the administration's cur-
rent Vietnamese policy, thus in-
Gleating that Davidson departs
from the national trend only
slightly.

Only eight per cent of the stu-

dents answering the poll and five

per cent of the professors sym-
pathize with the anti-war de-

monstrators who call for im-
mediate withdrawal of U. S.
troops from Viet Nam. Here too,
Davidson follows the national
trend, as six per cent of the stu-
dents and eight per cent of the
professors answering Playboy's
poll favor pulling out completely.

Davidsonians shy away some-
what from sending troops to
North Viet Nam in order to bring
the conflict to a quick conclu-
sion. Favoring this action were

According to Johnny Jeter,
IFC rush chairman, the 196 ac-
cepting bids — out of an original
270 freshmen going out for rush
— is about the same total as
last year. Of the 270, some 250
got redates, and 223 received
bids.

the student body vote to reaffirm or repeal the stu-
dent body regulations, was held the Tuesday before

the Christmas holidays.

At that time ballots were placed in the Cham-
bers Auditorium seats before assembly, and_ the

Council feared that there were voting irre

larities.

In addition, it was apparent that few students had
expected the vote or realized it was more than an

opinion poll.

‘he Council decided on Wednesday, the day
after the vote, to discard the ballots and repeat the
entire process after the holidays in order to follow
more closely the procedures for amending the con-
stitution which require five days between the initial
reading of the proposals and the vote.

The votes from the original referendum were

never counted.
The voting this time

will take place Tuesday,

(for all students except freshmen, who cannot vote
until second semester) in the first floor lobby of
Chambers from 8:20 until 1:00 and from 1:30 until

4:00.

A two-thirds majority of those voting is re-
quired for repeal of any one of the regulations,
which will be voted on individually.

JOURNALIST EXAMINES RHODESIA

The problems of the newly independent country of Rhodesia were
discussed in chapel Tuesday by Russell Howe, African correspon-
dent for The Washington Post. Howe related the historical events
which led up to the Smith government's unilateral declaration of
independence, and gave an analysis of the discriminatory practices
which underlie the present discontent of the non-white population
of Rhodesia. Howe concluded his remarks by stating his opinions
as to the Ifkelihood. of the success of Britain’s attempts to bring
down the white-supremacy government. (Staff Photo by Purvis.)

the Handbook,"’ Whitehead ex-
plained.

The new editor said that as-
signment as to number of page
for each section will be made
during second semester.

“We hope to have a larger
book next year, by at least 10 or
15 pages,” the editor said. “To
do this, we've either got to cut
the cost of printing or get more
ads.”

The Handbook will receive the
same budget allotment from the
college ‘as last year's book re-
ceived.

Whitehead stated that Ken-

drick had hopes of. expanding
the amount of advertising and
getting new advertisers.

Mime Reynders
To Appear Tonight

The Davidson College Artist
Series will present for its third
program of the season the na-
tionally famous mime, Frans
Reynders, at 8:15 tonight in
Chambers Auditorium.

The Dutch-born Reynders is
one of the few who have devoted
their lives to the ancient art of
pantomine.

Pantomime as an art throws
the entire burden on the expres-
siveness of body and face, with-
out the aid of costumes, settings,
language or even the insistent
rhythms and athleticism of
dance.

Behind each nuance in the in-
terpretations of Frans Reynders
there is, says one critic, “his
obvious talent. But in addition
there are many years of train-
ing, constant exercise and dis-
cipline, close observation of peo-
ple and things, a sense of humor
and his indispensable interest in
human nature.”

Reynders has performed since
1959 under the auspices of the
arts program of the Association
of American Colleges.

Those freshmen who received
bids but did not pledge must}!
wait at least until March 1 to|’

pledge a fraternity. Until then,
they will be able to go to fra-
ternity houses for meals and
other functions. Freshmen who

did not receive bids over Christ-|

mas may get bids at any time.

Pledging ceremonies may take
place any time after first semes-
ter.

In keeping with the rush pro-
gram this year, a few regula-
tions remain on the new fresh-
men pledges. Freshmen cannot
be in fraternity houses later than
7:30 p.m. for the rest of this
semester, except for one night
when they may stay as late as
nine o'clock.

Fraternity men may not be in
freshman dorms later than 7:30
so that freshmen will have a
chance to study, while freshmen
may go in upperclassman dorms
at any time.

During the second semester.
the new pledges will eat in the
fraternity houses.

There is also discussion con-
cerning intramural competition.
A faculty ruling freshman part-
icipation for fraternities in IMAC
competition. According to Sigma
Chi IMAC representative Jim
Appleby. a suggestion drawn up
by the IMAC.is to be presented
to the faculty requesting fresh-

| man eligibility.

Changes Proposed
In IFC Constitution

Several changes in the Inter-
fraternity Council constitution
were proposed at the IFC meet-
ing Monday night.

In a letter to the fraternities,
IFC President Jim Terry ex-
plained the changes, ‘They are
designed to update the constitu-
tion and make our organization
more able (and legal) to play the
role it was designated to do with
the creation of the Social Coun-
cil.”

The first two changes are con-
cerned with campus functions
for which the IFC is no longer
responsibile. The first change
eliminates a section which was
concerned with the required
quorum when the IFC was deal-
ing with entertainment bookings
and other matters now handled
by the Social Council.

Communist China is a paper
tiger and will not enter the con-
flict if the Viet Cong are deci-
sively driven back, while a
heavy majority of professors, 7
per cent, are of the same opin-
ion.

In. answer to a slightly slanted
question, 94 per cent of David-
son's students and 89 per cent of
the faculty members answering
the questionaire felt the neces-
sity of U. S. military power if

South Viet Nam is to remain
non-Communist.

In a similar question reflecting
ultimate aims and motives of
the U. S. involvement in Viet
Nam, 87 per cent of Davidson
students and 85 per cent of the
faculty concurred with U. S.
strategists in their belief that
“containment of Communism in
Southeast Asia within its present
limits’ is ‘important to the
security of the free world.”

Committee

To Make Rush Study

POWELL
Staff Writer

_With fraternity rush for 1965-666 now completed,
discussions concerning the fraternity rush system at
Davidson will turn to appraisals of the immediately-past

|| rush period.

The official appraisal of this
year’s rush will be presented to
the faculty at its February meet-
ing.by the Committee on Evalua-
tion of Social Life. Included in
the report will be the commit-
tee’s recommendations for fu-
ture rush systems.

Dr. W. G. Workman, chairman

of the committee, told THE
DAVIDSONIAN that the report
of the committee will be based
on interviews with members of
the Interfraternity Council, the
Social Council and the College
Union; and with fraternity men,
Independents, freshmen, faculty
members and administration
personnel.
‘Workman said that the com-
mittee has talked with or will
talk with anyone whom they
think can ‘‘shed light on the
subject.”

The committee expects to be-
gin considering concrete propos-
als concerning evaluation and
recommendation on Monday.

Workman said that his com-
mittee has been asked by the ad-
ministration and the faculty to
help look into two major pro-
blems — (1) the exclusiveness of
fraternities and the feeling of
rejection this causes some fresh-
men, and (2) the interference
with studies, if any, that fra-

The relationship of these two
problems to the past rush period
will be the focal. point of the
forthcoming report, but, as yet.
Workman said, the committee is
“not ready to pass any judg-
ments or make any recommen-
dations.”

Another area destined to un- :
dergo discussion by the com-
mittee is the possibility-of ex-
panding 'the fraternities’ social
affiliate programs, It has been
suggested by some students,
Workman said, that social af-
filiation be made available to
more or all Independents.

Members of the Committee on
Evaluation of Social Life in ad-
dition to Workman are Profes-
sors A. S. Abbott, H. M. Epes
and S. D. Maloney: Chaplain
W. H. Terry and students John
Burks, Tom Earnhardt, George
Kuykendall and Paul Simpson.
Tom Covington, assistant dean
of students, is a non-voting
member of the committee.

In addition to the official com-
mittee evaluation on the im-
mediately-past rush_ period.
about every member of the col-
lege community has begun to
form his own private criticism
of the rush. THE DAVIDSON-
IAN conducted on informal poll
of several] students to determine
any prevalent attitudes towards
this year’s rush.

Council
Discusses
Absences

The Student Council discussed
the problem of excessive ab-
sences at. meetings and went
over the schedule for the Stu-
dent Body Referendum at its
meeting Monday night.

Section 9, Article IV of the Stu- |
dent Body Constitution states
that any member shall be auto-
matically removed from the
Council if he is absent from
three consecutive meetings or
six metings during his term of
office ‘without compelling rea-
son.”’

Secretary Ben Cannon noted
that those members with three
or more absences included Can-
non, Billy Clark, John Fagg,
Randy McKnight. Dave Mes-
chan, Julian Prosser and John
Thomas.

President Bill Council, noting
that assembling a quorum had
become increasingly difficult,
asked the Council if another time
would be more suitable. Most of
the members agreed that the
present time was best. .

The Referendum on the Stu-
dent Body Regulations will be
held Tuesday. Ballots will be is-
sued at the regular polling place
on the first floor of Chambers
from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from
1:30 p.m. to 4, with counting
taking place that afternoon at 5,

Absent from the meeting were
Billy Clark, Dave Meschan and
Julian Prosser.
