Is mountain biking be the most t popular non-alcoholic activity?

By Jay Jennings
Mountain biking has become
one of the most popular new sports
in the last decade. Although many
students have mountain bikes, there
is not a good trail on campus for
their use. Therefore, most of the
bikes do not go for their intended
use of mountain biking and instead
are used on the concrete trails on
the Davidson campus. Students
with a real interest in mountain
biking are forced off-campus.
Mountain biking combines
exercise with adventure, which
separates it from other individual
sports. According to bikers, you’ve
got to know what you’re doing and
practice. Like any other sport, if
you practice you’ ll get better. But
what makes mountain biking dif-
ferent from running or swimming
and a lot like skiing is the thrill and
the danger involved. However,
this does not mean that one has to
be an expert to ride the trails; even
a beginner can enjoy biking.
Mountain biking started in
Marin County, California in the
laté 1970s when people took old
Schwinn bicycles and tried to
modify them for trail use. Eventu-
ally, the company Specialized came
out with the Stump Jumper in the
early 80s, which was the first moun-
tain bike as they are known today.
The mountain biking industry has
seen a steady climb since this time,
and the business is still growing.
As with any trend, mountain

biking has hit the Davidson cam-
pus. Some frustration exists among
mountain bikers because of the
lack of trails on-campus.

Senior Jim Livingston, an avid
biker, said that he tried to convince
Davidson Outdoors to build a trail
near the cross country trail witere
land has been cleared, but nothing
has come from this. According to
Livingston, if enough interest ex-
ists on campus, one would think
that a trail on-campus would not be

too difficult to get.

Peopie interested im going to
trails off-campus have three qual-
ity trails in the Chariotte area from
which to choose. The ciosestto the
Davidsom Campus is at Beach
Spring Mountain Bike Park off of
Popiar Tent Road in Concord. This
park has a 4.3 mile loop and a two
doilar donationisrequestedof each
hiker iorthe use ofthe trail. People
with varying degrees of ability can
ride at Beacit Spring.

Cane Creek Park in Waxsaw,
which is thirty minutes south of
Charlotte, has an eleven mile trail.
It costs one doilar per car and then
an additional dollar for each bike.
Cane Creek has races fairly often,
thus people interested in racing
should contact the park.

The other good trail in Char-
lotte is at Renaissance Park near
the Coliseum. This park has a
seven mile trail for bikers.

The type of bike is very im-

portant for any rider. Cool Breeze
Bike Shop in Mooresville suggests
three bike companies: Trek, Spe-
cialized, and Cannondale, which
have bikes that have won awards
in the last year. One could not go
wrong with any of these compa-
nies.

The type of bike one gets de-
pends a lot on how much money is
going to be spent. Some bikes can
cost well over a thousand dollars,
but others can be bought for con-
siderably less.

The wide tire design is essen-
tial for any mountain bike, because
they enable the rider to go over
roots and logs with greater ease.
Suspension systems have been
developed in the last couple of
years and provide a smoother ride,
but it comes at a great cost.

Another piece of equipment
that is important is a helmet. Any-
one who rides should use a helmet
to protect themselves from injury.
Trek and Bell make helmets that
reduce the risk of injury.

The trails in the Charlotte area
mentioned above should provide
interested people with an outlet to
utilize their skills and their bikes
that are used only to go to class.

As this new sport continues to
grow, new trails will hopefully
open closer to Davidson and maybe
one will be built on-campus. With
the right bike and great trails, many
hours of enjoyment can come from
this sport.

Sample this

The Samples’ latest album, The Last Drag.

_ The Samples, a popular band
among many students, will be
coming to Davidson College on
Friday, February 11. The band is
scheduled to perform in Love Au-
ditorium at 9:00 p.m.. The cost
will be $5.00 for Davidson stu-
dents and $10.00 for the general
public.

This concert, as well as the
concerts held at Homecoming,
Midwinters and Spring Frolics,
are arranged by the Concert Com-
mittee, a part of the Union Board.

Chairman of the Concert
Committee is selected through an
interview process in the second
week of February. Students who
are interested in being a part of the
Concert Committee can sign up
during the activity fair or get in
touch with the chairman.

This year’s chairman is
{sophomore Kelly Cunnigham. She

|The Samples will play in Love

described the purpose of the Con-
cert Committee: “It provides for
bands that students enjoy to come
to Davidson so that students do
not have to go somewhere else.”

There is a definite process in
deciding which bands to bring to
Davidson.

The students on the Concert
Committee formulate a list of
bands that they would be inter-
ested in hearing at Davidson. Then
different factors must be looked at
in order to narrow the list down.
These factors consist of cost and
availability.

Those students that work on
the committee admit that it is a lot
of work putting on aconcert. They
all agree, though, that it pays off

because they have the opportu-’

nity to hear a band they really
enjoy.
