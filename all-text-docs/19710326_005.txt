IN THE SPIRIT OF THE NEW SOCIAL SYSTEM?

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Marr Tells Fable Of Peril,

To the Editor:

Once upon a time, many
long years ago, when dis-
tances were ever so much
‘farther than they are today,
_ there lived three trolls: a Big
Troll. a Middlesized Troll,
and a Little Troll.

Now, like all trolls in
the land, these three had
two distinguishing character-
istics; they lived under a
bridge, and they had each
been endowed at birth with
a Little Red Wagon which
they were to fill at the pro-
per time with fruit from the
Land of Plenty.

So if you ever see a man
pulling a Little Red Wagon
who lives under a_ bridge,
you know he is a troll.

The trolls began their
arduous journey, but not be
fore asking directions of the
Wise Old Sage of the Forest.
The Wise Old Sage of_ the
Forest warned them: ‘‘The
way is long and difficult.
But by far, the most. diffi-
cult part of the journey is
at the Three-way Fork.

Now the greatest dangers
are the Pit of Dispair and
the Canyon of Complacency;
one road at the fork goes
to the Pit of Dispair, another
goes to the Canyon of Com-
placency, and the third leads
to the Land of Plenty.

The Right: fork will satisfy
you, the Left fork is the
shortest, and the Middle
fork never ends.”

By and by the trolls had
hauled their Little Red
Wagons up to the Three
Way Fork. The Middlesized
Troll, who was Conservative
and afraid to gamble, said:
“1 will take the Right fork,
for then | will be assured of
being satisfied.”

And he did, despite Little
Troll’s worning that he would
be stupid to haul his Little

Red Wagon so far, and de-

spite Big Troll’s admonition
that satisfaction might not
be’ the same: thing as happiji-
ness.

Then Little Troll; who was
somewhat lazy, said:- “I will
take the Left fork, because
it. is the shortest.” And he
did, despite Big Troll’s warn-

ing that the eaSy way is
not necessarily the best way.
Then Big Troll, who was

adventurous, said “I~ will

take the Middle. fork  be-
cause it seems the most ex-
citing.” And he did.

Now before long, the Left
fork upon which Little Troll
was traveling ended abrupt-
ly in a deep chasm. And be-
fore he knew it, Little Troll
had pulled his Little Red
Wagon into it. He spent the
rest’ of his life trying vain-
ly to climb out.

Sometime later, the Right
fork upon which Middlesized
Troll was traveling ended in
a box canyon. Fortunately,
the canyon was filled with
enough nuts and berries to
prevent starvation, but Mid-
dlesized Troll soon became
bored with such a_ small
place, and try as he might,
he could never find his way
out.

The Middle fork upon
which Big Troll was travel-
ing was lined- with ever-in-
creasingly plentiful and
tasty fruit. However, Big
Troll” Soon discovered ia
strange fact; and that was
that the further he hauled
his Little Red Wagon, the
farther he had to go. And
And yet, the journey became
increasingly pleasant.

Also he found that the
more he traveled, the strong-
er he became, so that he
was soon able to help other
people pull their Little Red
Wagons. Big Troll lived un-
satisfied, but happily ever

_after.

MORAL: There has been
much discussion. lately about
education at Davidson. I see
two possible pitfalls in out-
looks on the subject. The

first isthe trap of thinking

that a Davidson education is
hopelessly devoid of -either
meaning or of innovation.
This is simply untrue; there
are numerous possibilities
that have been created with-
in the past several years.
Did you know, for exam-

ple, that you can take basic-

Abnormal Psychology as a
seminar in the summer while
working (and being paid!)

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Workman Lists Innovation

Thank you for caHing at-
tention, in your editorial of
February 27,-to the improve:
ments in our educational
program made actual in
some cases.and probable in
others by .the expansion of
the Junior Year Abroad, the. '
development in the Honors
College and the Eight College
Exchange Program, and the
almost unlimited opportuni-

cf ties in Extended Studies. And

thanks to Paul Rowland
(same issue) for praising Dr.
E. L. Palmer and Dr. Randall
Kincaid for their innovations
in procedures of evaluation.

It might encourage further
effort. on the part of. the

ton Mental Hospital?’

That twenty-three — fellow
students are doing extended
studies in the penal instit-
utions in the area, while at
the same time pioneering a
model internship that is be-
ing observed eagerly by a
number of other schools?
That others are doing a. pre-
Jaw iiternahipl iv hich in-

cludes helping the Legal
Aid Society?
And of course everyone

knows of Davidson’s unique
Humanities Program; and
of the possibilities available
within the Honors College
and the North Carolina Fel-
lows program (even if they
are guilty of an unjustified
elitism).

But by far the most signi-
ficant change has been a
change in atmosphere; new
and dynamic forms of edu-
cation are being encouraged
more than ever.

Students are encouraged to

pursue independent re
search, and to. participate
in such programs as_ the

Orpheus

DAVID HANIG

> Copy Editor

The legend of Orpheus
and Euridice has proved to,
be a fertile source for dra-
matists; “Orfeu. Negro,”
which will be shown next
Thursday at 8:00 p.m.° in
Love Auditorium as part of
the Fine Films series, is the
screen adaptation of one such
play by the Brazilian poet-
diplomat Vinicius de Moraes.

As a film on the Orpheus
legend, ‘‘Orfeu Negro’s” em-
phasis is radically different;
whereas the classical myth
emphasizes Orpheus’ attempt
to raise Euridice from the
dead, “‘Orfeu Negro” stress-
es the love between Orfeu
and Euridice.

Euridice, played by Mar-
pessa Dawn—a dancer from
Pittsburgh and the only non-
Brazilian in the cast—comes
to the favelas of Rio, those

faculty and administration to
make mention of other steps
in the right direction (cp.
shaping behavior by the

method of reinforcing « ap--

proximations, Skinner et “al. ).
Allow me to list what seems
to me to be important new
developments in which the
Department of Psychology is
involved. I am sure that this
department is not unique:

1, The Advanced Experi-
mental Psychology course,
greatly modified this year by
Dr. John Kelton, which last
fall dealt with verbal learn-
ing and which will probably
be concerfied with —behavior
genetics next Fall.

2. The rigorous investiga-

Pitfalls

Program; professors are
creating possibilities like the
tutorials now available at
Western Carolina’ and
Broughton, while encourag-
ing students to revise the
lower level courses.

Ah, but Gentle Reader,
don't be tempted by the pre-
ceding observation to climb
out of the Pit of Despair
only to fall into the Canyon

of Complacency. There is so ,

much
done.
The recent changes at
Davidson fail to keep pace
with our increasing knowl-

that remains to be

~—€dge about how people learn

best; motivation here is still
provided largely by grades
instead of excitement about
the subject; and; dip. still
takes precedence over ideas
in many courses. -

The important idea for
students, professors, and ad-
ministration alike to remem-
ber is ‘that education is not
a thing— rather it: is a pro-

cess. It is up to all of us to

increase the rate of process.

shantytowns which give the
most beautiful views of the
bay in the city, to flee from
a mysterious stranger who
wants to kill her.

There she meets Orfeu, a
streetcar conductor played
by Breno Mello, who. used to
play for the Botofogo soccer
team, and they both fall in

“love with each other immed-

iately. g

Euridice, however, flees
from Death to the Rio power
plant where she disappears.
Distraught, Orfeu looks for
her in_ hospitals, at the
Bureau of Missing Persons,
and finally, tries to raise her
from the dead with macum-
ba, the Brazilian variety of
voodoa.

in the end, Orfeu_ joins
Euridice in death, and a boy
of the favelas picks up

Orfeu’s guitar and starts ‘to

play as the sun comes up.
The Carnival setting lends
the film a great sense of life;

‘Death’s pursuit of Euridice,

however, reminds us_ that
Death is present even amidst
the greatest vitality. The
setting heightens the tragedy
of the two young lovers and
gives the film a surrealistic
flavor.

It would be unfair not to
mention the importance of
the music to ‘‘Orfeu Negro."’
The score, composed by An-
tonio Carlos Jobim and Luiz
Bonfa and sung by Joao
Gilberto, reflects the melan-
cholic mood of the film. As
the. first example of bossa
nova, which has since be-
come popular in the U.S., the
score’s, influence has gone
beyond the limits of Brazil
to affect the popular music

of the West.
