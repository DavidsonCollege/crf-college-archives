Wrestlers hit
the mats

By Jason MCMULLAN
Staff writer

With the football season
quickly drawing to aclose, another
breed of Davidson’s big men will
soon be taking the spotlight. A 30-
foot circle on a rubber mat will
replace the grass of Richardson
Field as center stage as wrestling
season begins.

WRESTLING .

“We have no standouts, but
no weak links, either,” coach Tom
Oddo said. This year’s squad is
definitely a solid one. Senior co-
captains Sean Harvey and Jesse
Kenner will lead the Wildcats.
Sophomore Andy Sterling returns
after a very strong season last year,
in which he led the team in
takedowns and hada 21-13 record.

Ben Wall also promises to do
well this year; when his season
ended prematurely, he was leading
the Southern Conference in pins.
The Wildcats also welcome fresh-
man Christian Baker, a former
Tennessee state champion, to the
squad. Sophomore transfer Chip
Stewart is “a fabulous addition at
heavyweight,” Oddo said.

Next weekend the squad trav-
els to a pre-season tournament at
VMI. Only two thirds of the team
will travel to Virginia, but all 15
will make their way down to
Pensacola (Fla.) for their second

tourney on Nov. 18.

Even though the squad is lean
in numbers, Oddo’s ranks were
hand-picked. “It was a conscious
decision to have fifteen viable wres-
tlers instead of twenty less-com-
mitted ones,” he says. He also
stresses that as long as the team
stays virtually injury free, this sea-.
son promises to be a success.

In the last few years, Oddo has
had to concentrate on filling the
ten weight classes with quality
wrestlers. Now that he doesn’t
have “a weak weight class” any-
more, he can work on producing
top-quality wrestlers. “The quality
will improve with experience,” he
said. “Our numbers will give each
man a greater opportunity to get
more wrestling.”

“Our biggest goal is an attain-
able one,” says Oddo. “I think we
should have more guys winning
individual tournaments. Four or
five have a legitimate shot at get-
ting conference titles.” If a wres-
tler wins a conference champion-
ship, he then gets an automatic bid
to the Division I nationals. If Oddo
and his wrestlers accomplish their
goal, this year would be the first in
over 20 that would see a Wildcat in
the nationals.

This season, consisténg of four
tournaments and several “quad”
matches (matches involving four
different schools). The first home
match will be a quad on Dec. 2
against The Citadel, Apprentice
(Va.), and Coppin State (Md.).

Cassidy finishes his
class act career

By Micuaet Kruse
Staff writer

With tears in his eyes and a
tremulous voice, senior captain
James Cassidy spoke emotionally
about his time at Davidson after a
recent loss at Centre.

FOOTBALL

FEATURE

The defeat was the eighth of
his senior year, a season that
brought many individual conquests
and honors, but unfortunately for
the potent pass rusher and his se-
nior teammates, an extremely frus-
trating one in wins.

In setting school records for
sacks in a season (11.5) and ina
career (24) this fall, Cassidy has
served as an exemplary captain,
showing the extremely youthful
squad what it takes to be great.

“T hope I make an impact, and
I hope I show (the underclassmen)
how hard they have to work to be
good,” he said. “I wasn’t born a
great football player.”

But because of a driven per-
sonality coupled with a fierce, un-
wavering work ethic, that’s ex-
-actly what the gracious Cassidy

~ became, as “his-illustrious ‘college

football career came to an impres-
sive.conclusion.

Saturday afternoon, in a 7-7
season-ending tie against
Bridgewater, Cassidy helped con-
trol the defensive side of the ball
with 12 tackles and one sack.

Taking his leadership role as_.

captain very seriously, the 6-0, 238-
pound lineman commands respect
from both his coaches and his team-
mates, including the up-and-com-

" ing Davidson stars, as they admire

him as an outstanding player and
an upstanding human being.

Coach Tim Landis, who
worked with Cassidy for the past
three seasons, said of his most valu-
able player, “There’s not a single
person whoexemplifies a Davidson
College football player more so
than James.”

Freshman defensive linemate
Ben Spivey, who learned many of
his tactics from Cassidy this year,

’ said, “He’s one of the hardest work-

ing athletes I’ ve ever been around

in my life. It’s just been incredible ~

being able to play with him be-
cause he makes you so much better
just by having to play up to his
expectations and standards.”

Said first-year free safety Dan
Dearing, “We can look at him and
see what we'd like to be. His dedi-
cation to the: game can be seen
through his performances because
he is just an amazing football

player. I know he’s going to be
successful in all his football ex-
ploits in the future as well.” —

Concerning plans after his
upcoming graduation in May,
Cassidy said he will explore coach-
ing or playing possibilities.

Cassidy has done his job well
at Davidson. He has erected a solid
foundation for a squad whose fu-
ture appears intensely bright.
Cassidy the player may have made
his last football performance with
the Wildcats on Saturday, but his
values will continue to be promi-
nent as Davidson poises itself for
success on the field in the next few
years. ,

- “It’ll come around,” said
Cassidy, “It’s unfortunate that I
can’t be here for it, but I look
forward to the future of this pro-
gram.”

He has undoubtedly been a
key figure in developing Davidson
football, but he was not alone this
season.

Although a small group, the
octet of seniors in Cassidy, Bo
Bartholomew, Keith Davis, Adam
Gess, Tommy Haynie, Happy
O’Brien, Chad Richardson and
Will Robinson all contributed to
what Davidson football is now and
to what it will be.

They all represented Davidson
College on the football field for the
final time on Saturday.

Spirit team leaving its mark

By Betu LINDSEY
Staff writer

The Davidson Spirit Team is
in the process of conducting a
project to create a more festive
atmosphere .in the town of

SPIRIT TEAM

Davidson.

Team members will be re-
painting pawprints, now worn
away, that were painted on Griffith
Street, leading from Interstate 77
to the college.

This time, however, the
pawprints will extend all the way
to Main Street and into Baker
Sports Complex. They can be pur-
chased by student organizations
on campus, and the buyers will

then have their names put on the
pawprints.

The idea was presented by
Spirit team sophomore Hallie
Pitkin,

“My friends and I just thought
it was a good idea,” she said. “‘So
many other schools have them, and
they would certainly add to the

overall atmosphere here at

Davidson.”

There are many different or- -
ganizations supporting the project

on campus. “So many people seem
to be really ‘excited about this
project,”

Spirit Team advisor Jeanette
Scire said. “Most of the fraternities
and eating houses have already
bought pawprints as have other
student organizations, sports teams
and specific current and past resi-

Paw painting to lead the way to Davidson

dence halls.”

The Spirit Team hopes to be-
gin painting soon. Most recently,
team members were scheduled to
start painting very late Sunday
night.

“We have scheduled this sev-
eral times already, but the weather
simply has not been conducive to
it,” Scire said. “The roads must be
dry and the température must be
above forty degrees. We also have
to do it in the middle of the night so
as not to disrupt the flow of heavy
traffic in the middle of the day. The
Davidson police will be assisting
us.” :

There are still a few pawprints
for sale for $50, Anyone interested
should contact Scire at x2378 or
any Spirit Team member as soon
as possible.
