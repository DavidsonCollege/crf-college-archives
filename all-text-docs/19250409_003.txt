through a port hole. They have been
down the Mississippi River, through the
Gulf of Mexico, and Panama Canal, by
California and back to New York. They
are’ now planning for a more extensive
trip to Europe. Last week they were on
the hill to visit their many friends, prob-
ably for the last time in a good while.
