Sailors End Season

With USC Regatta

By JOHN McELEEN
Staff Writer

The Davidson sailing team
will compete in the last regatta
of the fall season this weekend

at the University of South’
Carolina
mo ace ‘‘Thistles”

Yon USC's home lake,
second regatta since
conference championships

Last week the team placed

urth of seven in a regatta at

€ of Charleston
outranking both USC and Old
Dominion.

Ayah Citadel handily won that

mpetition, taking first place
in the regatta, and first place
skipper awards in both the A
and B divisions.

Prior to the Charleston race,
the Cats sailed in the confer-
ence championships at the
University of Tennessee.

After an unusually good
showing in the Duke race the
week before the Cats “had
their hopes up’ for the
championship, according to
team commodore — Daryl
Douglas

Douglas skippered “Thistles”

and

Leonard manned the
Juniors” with Jim Stephenso
as his crew.

Though Daryl had captured

the lead after the first two
races, “Tennessee's home team

advantage began to pay ott
commented Daryl. The Cats
finished sixth of the seven
teams.

“The wind was fluky.” Dary]
continued, ‘‘and the Tennessee
team as well as the Citadel's
who sent their team up a day
early to practice. knew where
you could expect a little puff.”

“This home team advantage
“coupled with a race committee
that set up arbitary courses---
regardless of the wind.”
claimed Daryl, were two
factors partially responsible for
Davidson's last place showing.

The UT and The Citadel
teams exercised their
familiarity with the boats and
lake to its fullest, capturing
first and second places
respectively, according to
Douglas.
