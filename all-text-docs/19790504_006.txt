Inthe IMAC news this week,
the Fourskins downed the
Slacksters 9-8 in a game that
was played about five feet off
the ground. Graeme Thomson
finally came out of his five-year
—that’s right, five-year—
slump and got a hit. Airborn
Bongdexter gave up 74 earned
runs in the top of the fourth
inning, and later when he was
asked what happened, he re-
plied, ‘I know we have only
played two innings so far, I’m
positive I’ve only pitched
twice."’ Wrong again.

In the tourney look for any-
one but the favorites to win. To
save time, H.D. took all the
softball teams with winning
records and put them in one
bracket and all the other teams
and put them in another brac-
ket. Look for an interesting
tournament to say the least.

We had a letter this week
from Canon Carr, and we
thought if we printed it every-
one would understand just what

Dear Rev.:

Davidson athlete to have his
jersey retired. His No. 33 joins
No. 44 of Fred Hetzel, David-
son basketball star of the 1960's
and the school’s second leading
scorer behind Gerdy.. Gerdy was
also named the team’s most
valuable player for the third
consecutive year.

During Friday’s convocation
service, Gerdy was honored as
the recipient of the Tommy
Peters Memorial Award. This
award is given each year to the
top athlete ‘“‘who best exempli-
fies the Davidson spirit in
intercollegiate competition.”

Gerdy was not present to
receive the award, however,
because he had left Thursday
for Cincinnati to practice with
other members of the United
States Intercontinental Cup

team. The team, sponsored by
the Amateur Basketball Asso-

ciation of the United States and
coached by Cincinnati’s Ed
Badger, will play a series of
games in France, Russia,
Czechoslovakia, Israel, and Yu-
goslavia from May 5-19.
