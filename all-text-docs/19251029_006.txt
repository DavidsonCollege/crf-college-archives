Homecoming Day
Recalls Memories
of Former Events

On the fifteenth of November, 1924, the
Davidson campus was the scene of an
event which brought joy to the hearts
of everyone who was connected with Da-
vidson, That was the day set aside by
the college as Homecoming Day. That is
the day, when student met alumni, class-
mates met classmates, and fathers saw
sons in the light as fellowmen instead of
children. Throughout the whole day a
feeling of friendship and good feeling was
felt on the campus. This was only over-
shadowed by the sadness that all felt in
\leaving and in knowing that such times
‘as this could not last forever.

In the afternoon the Wildcats played
the University of North Carolina. game
of football which will never be forgotten
by the spectators. It was a game in
which Davidson, although they were ter-
ribly outweighed and doped to lose by
two touchdowns, fought as only those
Davidson Wildcats can fight and held
the stronger team to two field goals. The
spirit of the day semed to have gotten

by the score of 7 to 9. This was one of |
the closest games of the season and the |
victor was in doubt until the final
whistle was blown and there was great
rejoicing on the campus that night.

The V. P. I. game was the center of
attraction of the 1922 Home-coming Day.
In this game the Wildcats showed their
true strength and held the heavy Gob-
blers to a 7 to 7 tie. This game was like
the '24 game with Carolina in that it was
the test of a light team against a much
heavier one and the Wildcats showed
their spirit.

This year we are planning an event
which, will not only equal but will surpass
the one of last year. A holiday has been
declared and the festivities will start
Friday night with the picture show. On
Saturday will come the football game
with N. C. State and that evening a stunt
night will be presented which ought to
prove very interesting.

week and are expected to get into today’s
game.

Davidson will probably rely on its fast
forward passing attack, while the same of-
fense is strong on the State side, with Mc-
Dowell throwing the ball. Grey, a triple

ceiver of passes in North Carolina, all start
the ball on its aeriel route. Wells, in the
backfield, is one of the outstanding backs of
the state by virtue of his powerful off-tackle
runs against Wake Forest and other teams.

Mr. Baruch, a wealthy New Yorker and

contributed a quarter of a million dollars
towards the endowment. Reports so far
indicate that the campaign here will be
successful. Walter Hines Page, known
chiefly on account of his work as editor
of “World’s Work” and as ambassador
to Great Britain during the Wilson ad-
ministration, has devoted a great part of
his life to finding a‘ plan for internation
peace. Due to this fact it has been de-
cided to give the university his name.

size, and while only four of thése have
been taken, the rest are expected to be
occupied in the future. The Kappa Al-
phas have taken the second lot, the
Kappa Sigmas the third, the Beta Theta
Pi’s the fourth and the Pi Kappa Alphas
the sixth.

The houses which are to be built by the
different fraternities have not been defi-
nitely decided upon. The general plans
will be similar’ but the houses will be
different. Further advancement of the
work is being de!ayed as they are waiting
on the plans of the architect.

The new system will be a boost for the
Davidson fraternities and will undoubted-
ly be far more satisfactory in the future
as the fraternities grow.
