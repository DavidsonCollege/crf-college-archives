Davidson's Wildcats
invade Charlotte’s Me-
morial Stadium to
night for the first time
in four seasons, and
when the Cats play
host to Furman, it will
mark the renewal of a
long series of David-
son games in the
Queen City. Until
1951, Davidson had al-
most always played at
least one game in
* Charlotte, and fans
had given the Wildcats
a lot of support. But in

By JIM NOLSHOUSER the late forties, when
Wildcat football fortunes were rather slim, the Charlotte sup-
port dropped until it was finally necessary to play all home
games at Davidson. ‘

In November of 1950, the Cats played V.M.I. in the sta-
dium before stands that were virtually empty except for the
student section. The battle was played on a rain-soaked field,
and runners were constantly slipping to the turf. It was the
day that Auburn Lambeth completed pass No. 200 of his ca-
reer, and this was about the only thing Davidson students had
to cheer about as the Keydets massacred the Cats, 46-6. That
was the last time Davidson played in Charlotte.

. But there have also been pleasant memories of Memorial
Stadium. Few who saw the 1949 scrap with N. C. State will
forget little Jake Wade’s 95-yard run following a pass inter-
ception in the last quarter. Wade pulled dqwn a State pass in-
to the flat and was gone before the Wolfpack realized what
had happened. It: gave the traditional-underdog Cats a 20-14
victory.

This year, Davidson returns to the stadium in the hope
that Charlotte fans will once again come out and back Wildcat
football. It could be the beginning of a long tradition, since
Furman also has a lot of alumni and fans in Charlotte. David-
son has played a lot of football in front of Charlotte fans. We
hope they will give Davidson the backing necessary to keep
playing there.

® e * o

-On that dreary November day mentioned above, a big
cheer went up in the last half when the PA system announced
that Lambeth had just completed his 200th pass. It was one
of the many highlights in a career that few recent Davidson
men can match. “Aubie” completed a total of 222 passes in his
four years at Davidson, less than thirty below the national
record. He ranked among the top twenty players in the na-
tion in passing average, and though the Cats didn’t always
win, he was practically always a standout.

Lambeth spent most of his college football career in the
tailback slot of the single-wing formation. This made his pass-
ing attack even more of a threat, since the opposition had to
stop his end sweeps and off-tackle slants. And often the de-
fense would charge in to stop the running back only to find
him “floating” the ball over their heads. Lambeth had the gift
of being so accuraf® in his pitching that he could “float” the
ball without the constant danger of an interception.

When the Wildcats switched to the “T” formation under
Crowell Little, Lambeth moved into the quarterback slot and
continued to shine. He was voted to innumerable team honors
(All-Conference, All-State, All-Opponent teams of different
schools, etc.), and he set a Southern Conference record by
completing five touchdown passes in one game.

Auburn Lambeth will long be remembered as one of the
greatest passers Davidson has ever had, and the last time the
Cats played in Charlotte was one of his “big” days. Let’s hope

Kappa Sigs, Sigma Chis
Tied In Greek Action

t
BY BUNNY PERKINSON

The touch football season in the inter-fraternity league is
just about at the half-way mark, and as the race enters the
homestretch, the Kappa Sigs and Sigma Chis are tied for the
lead. Last week's leaders, the Phi Delts, dropped two battles
this week and dropped behind the leaders. The two teams

tied for the lead both have 5-1 records.

Yesterday’s action affected the
standings in a big way. The Sigma
Chis beat the Kappa Sigs, .31-26,
scoring on the last play of the
game. The win moved the winners
into the tie for top spot. The KAs,
who have lost only to the Pikas,
won their fourth decision yester-
day as they massacred the Phi
Delts, 51-18.

In games on Monday afternoon,
the Pikas downed the hapless Cam-
pus Club team, 46-7; and the im-
proving Betas dumped the Pi
Kapps by the score of 20-6. The
SAEs edged the SPEs, 12-7, in a
thriller.

In addition to the game between
the Kappa Sigs and the Phi Delts
on Tuesday, which the Kappa Sigs
won, 13-7, the Sigma Chis won a
39-7 decision over the Phi Gams,
who are still looking for victory
number one. In another real tus-
sle, the KAs took the measure of
the ATOs and dropped them from

a second to a sixth place tie.
Wednesday afternoon was a day
of high-scoring games, as the

‘Betas trounced the Campus Club,

62-7, and the Pikas dropped the
winless SPEs, 32-6. The game
scheduled between the Pi Kapps
and the Phi Gams was postponed.

Lead Furman Rushing

Tonight at Charlotte Memorial Stadium, Davidson fans

will get a look at two of the best halfbacks in the Southern
Conference, and Wildcat followers are hoping that the David-
son defense will be able to do what many others have tried, but

failed, to do—stop the Hurricane’s John Popson and Ted Yaki-

mowicz. It will be a tough job,
since the two backfield stars both
rate in the top ten ‘in Southern
Conference rushing. Yakimowicz is
the fourth-place rusher, and Pop-
son is tenth.

Though his running mate has
the better average, Furman sup-
porters rate Popson as the strong-
est threat in the Hurricane back-
field. Popson’s kick-off return
average has soared to 51 yards per
game. This includes long gallops
of 97 and 103 yards against Miami
and The Citadel.

Popson and Yakimowicz may
find the going a bit rough against
the Wildcats who now boast the
second best defensive record in
the Southern Conference. The
Davidson team has held opposing
runners to an average of only 124
yards per game.

Though the ‘Cats will undoubt-

edly have their eyes on Popson
and Yakimowicz tonight, they can-

not afford to overlook the Hurri-
cane quarterback Jim Boyle who
leads the conference in total of-
fense and has the second-best pass-
ing average in league competition.

Sounds like a rough combina-
tion to stop, but the Wildcats have
the equipment to do it. It promises
to be a real thriller.

BEAT RICHMOND

BY LEON HOWGALL, JR.

Davidson College’s cross country
team continued their winning
ways by defeating a strong team
from the University of Richmond.
The meet, run here last Saturday,
October 16, wound up with David-
son on top, 24-36.

Richmond brought a very fine
runner here in Chukinas, who took
first place with the good time of
21 minutes and 20.5 seconds over
the four mile course. Coach Whit-
tle believes he has a good chance
to win the Southern Conference
championship, particularly since
he defeated “Pete” Ashcraft, who
beat him in the frosh mile at the
Conference meet last year.

The fact that Richmand took
first and third and still lost indi-
cates that this was a team victory
for us. Besides Ashcraft, who came
in a close second, Feeney, Wilson,
Lovette, and Patterson finished
fourth through seventh respective-
ly. This show of depth pushed the
other team under.

If these hardworking boys could
be characterized by any one word,
it would have to be improvement.
Each one is gradually getting bet-
ter, particularly Handley, Jackson,
and Woods.

On Saturday, they travel to Ra-
leigh to engage William and Mary
and North Carolina State in a tri-
angular meet. State, in particular,
appears powerful, having already
defeated the University of North
Carolina.

Cats Still Pacing
Conference Action
Despite PC Loss

BY BOB PULLIAM

Davidson’s Wildcats’ Southern
Conference leaders risk their con-
ference lead and a possible share
in the championship against the
Purple Hurricane of Furman to-
night in Charlotte. This is the last
conference game of the season for
the Cats, and a victory would leave
them undefeated in conference
play.

Marman, ted by halfback John-
ny Popson and quarterback Jim
Boyle, wil] present a powerful
ground attack that crushed Pres-
byterian, 27-0, and Citadel, 31-20.
Davidson defeated the same Cita-
del but was upended by the Blue
Hose, 10-7.

Virginia Tech, one of the two
Southern Conference teams rank-
ed nationally, takes on Virginia at
Roanoke, in what should be as
breeze for the Gobblers.

West Virginia, tenth ranked
team in the nation, should continue
their winning ways against a weak
V.M.I. team. The Mountaineers,
who have the worst part of their
season behind them, are gunning
for another trip to the Sugar Bowl
on January 1.

The only other game involving
two conference teams is the
George Washington-William and
Mary game Friday. William and
Mary rates a slim six-point favor-
ite.

The Citadel plays non-conference

urday against Billy Joe Patton and | Presbyterian in Charleston on Sat-

his Morganton cronies, the Wildcat
linksters take on Charlie Feezor's
crew from the Salisbury Country
Club.

All players who wish to make

the trip shoyld contact either Mic-
key Cannon or Martin Foil. These
two players are making arrange-
ments about transportation, and
the earlier they are contacted, the
easier it will be. So make it early.

A lot of interest has been shown
by Davidson students thus far, and
there was a good representation
which played at Morganton last
Saturday. Though the weather was
bad, the matches were played as
scheduled, and this early exper-
jence is certain to pay off next
spring.

Records To

Go On Line

BY JOHNNY JOHNSON
Davidson's football team will be fighting for their fourth

win of the season tonight when they meet Furman University
at 8 P. M. in Charlotte Memorial Stadium in Charlotte. The
Davidson boys are out to upset their strongest opponent of

the season, an opponent that
1948.

Three important men — Harry
Peterson, Jim Fasul, and Captain
Dickie Davis — who have been out
of regular play in some. of the pre-
vious games will be in the David-
son starting lineup. They will add
needed weight and experience to
the forward wall.. Also starting in
the line will be freshman center
Bill Price, left tackle Tom Lee,
and sophomore ends Bill Gramley

they haven’t conquered since

pass defense because of Furman's
strong air attack. Angered by last
week's loss to a fired-up P.C. team,
the ‘Cats are determined to get
back into the win column,

Coach Dole said, “Furman is the
biggest and strongest team that we
will meet this year. I hope that we
have enough manpower to stop
them.”

Truly, the Purple Hurricanes
are loaded with talent. Jim Boyle,
their ace quarterback, leads the
Southern Conference in total of-
fense with 374 yards gained in five
games. Right halfback Jim Popson
is a hard and shifty runner that
opposing teams have found dif-
ficult to stop. Right end Ronald
Barefoot, who is second in the
conference in pass receiving, teams
with left end L. G. Hightower to
make the Hurricane aerial assault
effective.

Furman has three wins and two
losses to its record this season.
The Purple Hurricane has beaten
Newbery, The Citadel, and Pres:
byterian College, which is David.
son’s lone conquerer; it has lost to
Miami of Florida and South Caro-
lina.

The history of the Davidson-Fur-
man competition is long. The teams
first played in 1902 when the Pur-
ple Hurricane won, 60. The Wild-
cats, in 1916, won the second con-
test by a score of 58-13. The two
teams have been fairly evenly
matched, with a margin of two |
games being the difference. In six-
teen years of competition, David-
son has won 7 and lost 9. Last year
Furman won 34-0.

The Wildcats realize they have
tough opposition, but they are up-
set-minded tonight.
