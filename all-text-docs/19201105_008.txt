THE DAVIDSONIAN, NOVEMBER 5, 1920.

DEBATE PRELIMINARY
IN EU. SOCIETY

Seven contestants presented them-|
selves last Wednesday evening, October
27, for the forensic fray in the Eumen-
ean debating society. It was the regu-
lar time for the selection of the Junior-
Senior team, and also for choosing those
from whom the intercollegiate debaters
will be elected to oppose Randolph-Ma-
con here December 7. The query, “Re-
solved, That the Federal Government
should for a period of twenty years pro-
hibit all immigration of Japanese labor-
ers to this country or any of its posses-
sions,” was fiercely and_ relentlessly
knocked about by every wind of Soph-
ism known in the catalogue of fallacious
logic. Since the incongruity of the many
points brought out prevents an adequate
summary of the arguments being made,
be it said that several of the speakers
upheld nobly the lasting reputation be-
queathed to that venerable society by
R T. L. Liston. Mitchell's speech was
casily the best and most beautiful ex-
hibition — given. His characteristic
fluency and grace again won him his
position. Boulware and Bitzer, how- |
ever, ran him close seconds. But the
surprise of the evening came when P. D.
Miller, official time-keeper, beckoned to
a member of the audience to take his
place as custodian of the ‘watch, and
descended most terribly upon his unsus-
pecting rivals. Though Miller spoke ex-
tempore, he succeeded im convincing the
judges that he was one of the best de-
baters there. Miller's name had not ap-
peared with the prepared list of artists,
which was composed of: A. M. Mitchell,

J. R. Boulware, R. Bitzer, E. B. Me-
Gukin, J. P. Price, F. L. Frazer, and D. B.
Walthal. Mitchell was incligible for the
Junior-Senior team, on account of being
a member of one of last year's inter-.
collegiate outfits. The judges rendered |
a long delayed decision, announcing the!
following men as winners: For the in-|
tercollegiates, A. M. Mitchell and R.!
Bitzer, with J. R. Boulware as alternate;
for the Junior-Senior team—R. Bitzer,
J. R. Boulware, and P. D. Miller, with
J P. Price as alternate.

and continued to push the Wildcats back
making their second touchdown, when
Jarvis went through Davidson’s line
and ending the game with Kullock fail-|
ing to kick goal. :

For Citadel Jarvis and Frost played
fine games in the backfield, making most
of their gains. Jarvis finally succced-
ing to put the pigskin across David-
son's goal for two touchdowns.

Brady the stalwart Wildcat center!
was Davidson's main stay in the defen-
sive and was a power in the offensive.
His good kicking netted three points
for the Red and Black. Romefelt at!
left guard was also a force in the line.
Clary, by his continued long end runs
did fine work in the backfield and with
the assistance of Bethea, McFadden,
Shepherd and Long carried the Wild-
cats to victory.

ing until she came back with that little
song about “The Apples on the Lilac
‘Bush”—it re-established her in popular
favor.

The finale was not “grand” but it was
a bit unusual and sent the crowd away
in a pleasant mood. As a whole it was
an excellent show, and it is only hoped
that the future numbers of the course
will measure up to it.
