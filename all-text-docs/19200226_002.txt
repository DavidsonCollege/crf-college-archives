ners; Hecklin Plays Good Game
for Losers; Fast and Hard
Fought From Start.

Gaining an early lead in the first
few minutes of the game and in-
creasing it gradually until the final
whistle, Davidson won a hard fought
and interesting game from Wofford
by a 38 to 17 count. The game was
fast, despite the fact that numerous
fouls were called, both sides com-
mitting many. Spectacular shots
brought the gallery to its feet time
and again. ‘ .

The first half opened up with Da-
vidson scoring a foul and a field
goal in the first minute of play.
From this time on the Wildcats were
never headed. Wofford scored the
next point and the remainder of the
first half was nip and tuck, with Da-
vidson drawing away from the
Black and Gold in the final min-
utes. The half was replete with
personal fouls, Chalmers being put
out of the game in the first 10 min-
utes on what was seemingly a held
ball, but unusually close refereeing
put him out. Roberts was shooting
wild, scoring five field goals in the
first stanza. For the Methodists,
Hecklin lead with two field goals
and six fouls. The half ended 19 to
12 in Favor of Davidson.

The second half opened slowly,
but after the first few minutes the
Wildcats located the basket and
from then on it was a walkaway.
Heavy guarding on the part of Brice
and Striebeck held the Wofford
quint to a lone goal. Three foul
goals were shot, making a total of
five points in all for the South Caro-
lina lads. Roberts and Romefelt
shot regularly and after the middle
of the half there was no doubt as
to the final result. Roberts caged a
neat shot from the center of the
floor, which drew heavy applause
from the spectators, especially the
delegation from Converse College,
who were out in full force with Red
and Black colors on. The features
of the game were the scoring of
Hecklin for the losers, who made all
but two of his team’s 17 points, and
that of Roberts for the winners, who
scored 22 of the 38 points. Also the
playing of Romefelt and Brice, who
did splendid defense work, time
after time breaking up Wofford at-

tacks. The score:

TRACK TEAM TO TACKLE
TOUGH SPRING SCHEDULE

As the spring approaches and the
weather becomes warmer the minds
of several men on the campus turn
toward thoughts of the “cinder
path” sport.

The prospects this year for a win-
ning track team are very good, with
four letter men back: Captain Harry
Murrey, S. D. Brice, F. D. McCleod
and James Sprunt. Other men who
have signified their intention of
working for a berth on the. team are
Denniston, Mauze, Fricker, Leonard
Dick, George Adams, and others.

Several trips are being planned,
among which are meets with Trinity
College, N. C. State, University of
South Carolina, and also a meet at
Chapel Hill with the colleges of this
state and possibly one more meet at
Atlanta with Georgia Tech and oth-
er Southern teams.

Besides these trips, Captairi Mur-
tey is planning to have two or three
contests on the hill with visiting
track teams from some of.the neigh-
boring colleges.

A meeting of the track men has
already been called and work will

IN MIGHTY CONFLICT.

In a hard fought and interesting
contest the Varsity defeated the
Scrub quintet to the tune of 42 to
28. The Scrubs opened up with a
rush and had caged several baskets
before the Varsity recovered them-
selves. The Varsity did not lead the’
Scrubs in the first half until the last
few minutes of play, when Roberts!
shot from the middle of the floor.
The half ended with the Varsity on
the long end of a 17 to 16 score.

The passing and shooting of the
first team in the second period was
too fast and accurate for the Scrubs
to continue the pace which they had’
set. Although the Scrubs fought
gamely throughout the entire con-
test, the Varsity’s teamwork com-
pletely baffled them in the second

alf. Roberts for the Varsity and
Hengeveld for the Scrubs were the
main point gainers of the game.

WHITE, HAWKINS AND
FRICKER PUTTING
GOLF COURSE IN SHAPE

The golf players’ dreams are about
to come true—the golf course is be-
ing cleaned off. With the approach
of spring the beautiful green links
will be the scenes of great activities.
The numerous stumps are being
blasted out and the ground smooth- |
ed over. The shrubbery that would
soon obstruct the view of “would-
be” players is being cut down and
burned. Special attention is being
given to the seventh and eight holes,
so the players will no longer have to
turn back after completing the
sixth,

Any one interested in golf should
not neglect this opportunity to play.
New members will be initiated into
the club for the usual small fee of
$5. Balls and clubs may be purchased
from Huston White at a low rate.

WHO WILL BE NEW COACH
STILL REMAINS A MYSTERY

“Who is the new Coach going to
be” has been the query of many
curious minded students ever since
the resignation of Coach Crayton.
Many men have been discussed and
the chances of getting them here
figured, but as yet no definite infor-
mation has been given out. It has
been learned, however, that in the
near future this mystery will be
solved and the name of the new
coach announced. Whoever he is,
he will be the best that can be got-
ten and the prospects for a good
year in athletics next year are very
bright.

« RO. T.C. NEWS.

The inspector, Colonel Palmer,
will arrive in Davidson within a few
days. All equipment should be in
excellent condition, so that he can
at least say of the unit that it is
good looking. Of course, we expect
to rank high again in military effi-
ciency, but we want to do our. best
for him.

All men who contemplate attend-
ing the summer camp are requested
to call at the office immediately and
give their names, inasmuch as Cap-
tain Mueller is required to submit a
list of names, together with clothing
measurements and other informa-
tion prior to the end of February.
If necessary, write home, but do it
at once so that no delay will result.

The summer camp this year is
Camp Benning, Ga., Infantry School
of Arms, where the last word of in-
struction in modern arms and up-to-
date training is given. The camp
will last from June 17 to July 28.

The seal of Davidson College is
shown in black with golden letters
on a field af red: The seal is ar-
ranged to read right on both sides
of the flag. These colors are the
most appropriate that could be used
as the emblem of our unit, and our
thanks for this beautiful standard
are most heartily extended to Mr.
Pharr for his generosity.

Captain Mueller has written the
following letter of thanks to Mr.
Pharr:

Headquarters, R. O. T. C,
Davidson College, N. C.,
February 18, 1920.
Mr. James W. Pharr,
Charlotte, N. C.
Dear Mr. Pharr:

The R. O. T. C. flag arrived yes-
terday. It is a beauty and we are
very proud of it.

In behalf of the R. O. T. C..I wish
to express sincere thanks for your
very generous gift, and assurance
that we will endeavor to prove
worthy of same. The deep affection
which we bear your generosity and
patriotism will be reflected in the
honor that we will render this flag.

This flag will inspire us to great
achievements, and to emulate the
donor by becoming big hearted and
generous supporters of the highest
ideals: of Christian education. It will
likewise be an inspiration to the ful-
fillment of the obligations of true
citizenship.

Should you find it convenient to
honor us with a visit in the near fu-
ture, we will take great pleasure in
having a presentation ceremony. If
you do not desire this, may we not
have you with us for a parade or a
review ?

With heartfelt thanks and deep
appreciation, | remain,

Sincerely yours,
A. H. Mueller.

D. M. Gaston, '22, continues ill at
his home at Aberdeen. His illness
followed and resulted from his at-
rack of influenza at Davidson in
1918.
