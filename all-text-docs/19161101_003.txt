WRITES OF EXPERIENCES

In answer to numerous inquiries from) 3rd Reg.

the students and others as to the present
mobilization on the border, | will give
the itinerary of our North Carolina unit
for the past month. We moved from
Camp Glenn, N. C.. on the coast, the
latter part of September, in ten long
special trains, each regiment being
routed over a different railroad system.
My detachment, Field Hospital No. 1.
was entrained with Ambulance Co. 1
and Troops “A” and “B” calvary. It
was a long heavy train and we were five
days making the trip, being routed by
the Atlantic Coast Line via Savannah.
The trip was unusually pleasant thru-
out, for being a military train, we could
stop whenever the commanding officer

S. [an expert rifleman.

thought it best for the men. The train
was composed of tourist. sleepers, and
one standard Pullman. We stopped a
few hours each at Savannah, Montgom-
ery and San Aatonie. At each place the
men were given “setting up” exercises
and a march around the city, and then
left to their own pleasure for sight-see-
ing. At Lake Charles, La.. we stopped
for two hours, and evervone went in tor
a swim. All the troops reached FE] Paso
in good shape and without accident.

The railroads have shown wonderful
eficiency in handling troops, and when
we think of the unusual distances, we
can point with pride to our transporta-
tion, Our journey covered over 2,300
miles, and when we consider that. the
soldiers from the Northern States trav-
¢led much further, and that the hand-
ling of 140,000 troops over such dis-
tances has been done without the loss of
man, our system compares well with
the European efficiency we hear so much
about.

I) Pasa, ‘Pevxas, is one of the militar

hases for any contemplated movement
into Mevico. Tt is a city of 85,000,
with plenty of Western hustle to it.
Over 45,000 soldiers are camped there,

and this adds to business.

Our unit is in the Seventh Division
with Pennsvivania troops, and we have
a fine camp. Altitude 4,000 feet, clear
days, cold nights. All the men are in
excellent health. Some of the units are
composed of great part of college men
and are a fine sight. “This is true of
such trops as the engineers, signal corps
and hospital outhts, It is a sight to be
remembered to see 45,000 troaps, with
all the accompanying artillery. cavalry,
and transport, at drill) on) the plains.
The Mexican outposts are in’ sight, but
there seems to be no reason to. expect
war, altho we are prepared for it. It
is the writer's opinion, based on reliable
information and observation, that — the
President has seen the Mexican affair in
its proper perspective, “Vhe bandit raids
are just such raids as we had in this
country in frontier days, and are not any
occasion for war. ‘The Mexicans need
teachers and missionaries. “There were
women and children starving and dying
of typhus in sight of us—across the river
in Juarez. “Phe border needs a guard,
and it has it. and the troops will be kept
there until danger is passed.

‘There is a good sprinkling of David-
son doing their duty there and all of
them are measuring up to the high
standard to be expected of them. Lieut.
R. R. Morrison, ‘02, battalion adjutant
tst Regiment, is on duty in Jacksonville
with the rifle team. A. M. Siler
(‘Doc’) is also with the rifle team as
He has been pro-
noted to 2nd lieutenant in his machine
gun company. Capt. Miles Abernethy.
‘o6, is in the ard Reg. Hospital Corps.
He is another expert marksman, but
inedical officers cannot compete. Capt.
Don Scott, ‘05, is regimental adjutant.
Nimmocks, Porter and Mor-
gan are doing goad service, as are Louts
Johnston, Douglas Brown and Lamont
Field from tawn. Archie Baker and A.
T. Carroll are in the hospitat corps of
S. C. James Allen, one of our finest
debaters and a leading voung lawyer of
Charleston, is in the Charleston Light
Dragoons. a famous old calvary troop.
Tohn McSween is chaplain of the 2nd
S. C., with rank of lieutenant. Warn-
er DuBose, '05. is in charge of one of
the Y. M. C. A. buildings, and is doing
an excellent work. he Y. M. C. A.
work on the border is well organized
and is abundantly supplied with funds
from the Rockefeller Foundation.
Rufo Fitzpatrick. ’02, is first lieutenant

fullback on the Davidson team. ALL in
all, the men on the border are getting
the best of training in a country that is
a health resort, and all of them will re-
turn in better physical condition on ac
count af the service.
