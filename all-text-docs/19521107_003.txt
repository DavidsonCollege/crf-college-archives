The interfraternity football race

battered but proud
Wildcat gridders pre-
pare for their last home
game of the '52 season
with Richmond, last
week’s fracas up in
Cambridge becomes lit-
tle more than another
line in the record book
. as far as its national sig-
nificance is concerned.
Yet that game has
earned a place in David-
son football history all
its own.

The only regret this
reporter has about the
Harvard game is that the whole Davidson student body couldn't
_be on hand to see it. As soon as the head knocking started on
that balmy afternoon, it was obvious that Davidson was going
to be in the ball game in a big way, contrary to the predictions
of the oddsmen and the highly overconfident wearers of the
Crimson.

It is doubtful that a Davidson team has ever played a
more inspired game than they did last Saturday. There is no
student, faculty member, or alumnus of Davidson who would
not have been filled with pride at the performance of the Cats
that day. That is one reason why we didn't single out any
one player as Wildcat of the Week. It was the Davidson team
all the way, and along with some real football exhibition
Dole’s team’also showed the Ivy Leaguers what real Southern
sportsmanship was like.

; It is impossible to say what single factor, if there was
any that caused the Cats to play such a terrific game against a
much stronger and more powerfal team, but there isn’t any
doubt that the headlines that greeted them in the Boston papers
Saturday morning aroused their ire more than somewhat. Head-
lines proclaaming HARVARD SEEN EASY WINNER. HAR-
VARD SUBS SEE ACTION AGAINST UNDERDOGS,
and HARVARD TO REST REGULARS AGAINST LIT-
TLE DAVIDSON made the Cats burn, and there is little doubt
the Harvards could have cheerfully strangled the men who
wrote those stories.

In spite of brilliant playing and smart strategy on the
part of the Davidson aggregation, the final score stood at 35-26.
But that’s one score nobody from D.C. need be ashamed of.
That fact was pretty plain when the team struck up a couple
of good rousing choruses of “Dixie” as the chartered buses
went careening through the streets of Boston after the game.

A Few Facts On Harvard Athletics

Things are done in a big way at Harvard as far as ath-
letics are concerned. A little discreet questioning in Cambridge
brought forth some startling facts, not the least of which is
that the Ivy League school spent a cool million dollars on their
athletic program last year, and that doesn’t include football
scholarships, which they don’t give. In this connection, however,
it is interesting to note that most if not all members of the
Harvard football team have scholarships based on scholastic
ability.

They don't have fraternities at Harvard, but there is an
intramural program similar to Davidson's, in which the various
“Houses” compete against each other in several sports, and the
competition is just as keen there as it is here.

The College of Harvard University has some 4500 stu-
dents enrolled, and a very high percentage of them engage in
the collége-sponsored and unofficial intercollegiate sports. Way
back about 100 years ago the first intercollegiate sports event
in America was held when the Harvard crew raced an outfit
from Yale on the Charles River (so the Harvard publicity man
told us).

Basketball coach Danny Miller
started practice last Monday with
Fifty boys showing up for the first
week of workouts.

Five lettermen are returning
from last year’s squad, and at least
three of them are expected to win
births on the first team. They are
“Ish” Bennet, Jerry King, and
Joe Dudley, all starters last year.

The rest of this year's squad is
made up of about fifteen upper
classmen and _ fifteen freshmen.
Scotty Reams, Buddy Brown, and
Jim Faucette, who played on the
“B" squad last year, appear to be
strong contenders for varsity
births this season.

There are several good freshman
prospects working out. with ‘the
team, but Miller observed that
he could not tell at this early date
just how big a part these men
would play in the Wildcats’ cam-
paign.

Suppose you had the unenviable
task of picking the Wildcat of the
Week. Who'd be your choice after
the Cats’ great game with Harvard
last. Saturday?

Would you pick Johnny Gray,
‘who set up the first Davidson TD
‘with a beautiful 79-yard punt re-
turn, and who otherwise played a
whale of a game at halfback?
Or would you take Roy White,
who scored two of the Cats’ four
TD’s, one in the last minute of the
game on a magnificent 98-yard
kickoff return?

Or would you make it Jack
‘ Ruth, whose passing kept Da-

‘vidson in the ball game quarter

after quarter, making the Crim-

ton look ridiculous in their

“breather”?

Maybe you'd choose Harry
Peterson, who played a_ terrific
game at defensive tackle, especial.
ly if you realized that it was Pete’s
first college game.

Then again you might like Bob

Loy, who wasnt’ letting anybody
get away with anything that balmy
Saturday afternoon,
Perhaps you'd take Neil Graham,
who turned ‘em every way but
loose in his new position, the line-
backing slot which carries as many
if not more rough knocks than
any other position on the team.

But if you picked any of
these guys, would it be fair to
linemen like Ben Craig, and
Gene Pierce, and Harold Da-
vis, and Dickie Davis, and Dick
Perkins, and Jim Patterson,
and Charlie Cousar, and Tom
Owen, and Bob Patten, and
Neil Graham, and Jimmy Da-
vis, and Gene Davis, and Dick
Kelley, or any other of the
linemen who did such a great
job against the overstuffed Ivy
Leaguers? !
And what would you say about
‘Jim Thacker, whose pass snagging
brought the Cats several first
downs, and who scored the second
Davidson TD? Or what about Ta!

defensive play at halfback kept the

Pete Whittle commented, “with
the rest of the teams fighting it

The winning team will be
awarded a team trophy, and the top
ten runners of the meet will be
given individual trophies.

Whittle’s harriers lost last week

stitute team which was third in
the conference last year, The Da-
vidson team showed improvement,
however, as six of the, eight run-
ners bettered their previous times.

performances, placed first and bet-

Ruth Doubtful
Starter; Gray To

Take Over Duties

By BOB OWENS
Quarterback Jack Ruth to-
day appeared a doubtful start-
er for the Cats’ final home game

of the season against Richmond

Saturday afternoon. Coach Bill
Dole named Johnny Gray as
the man to step in should an
internal ailment keep Ruth
sidelined. ;

Several injuries in the last quar-
ter of the Cats’ 35-20 toss to Har-
vard last Saturday proved costly
to the Wildcats, and there are a
total of eleven other top players
who are doubtful starters for Sat-
urday’s battle with Richmond. Full-
backs Henry Brown and Leroy
Fargason, along with halfbacks
Jimmy Thacker, Tal Broughton,
and Johnny Gray, all suffered in-
juries and most will see only limited
duty against ‘the Spiders.

Several linemen, including Tom
Owen, Bob Patten, Charlie Miller,
and Gene Pierce also are nursing
injuries. Captain Arnold Whisnant,
who was painfully hurt against
Furman two weeks ago, and alter-
nate captain Dick Kelley, who is
nursing a bruised shoulder are two
steady performers who will not

be up to par for Saturday's en-.

counter with Richmond.
Freshman Jim Shelton is slated
to fill the fullback slot in the event
Fargason can’t play tomorrow.
