Administration revises
Parental Leave policy

By Liz Barry
Senior Staff Writer

Davidson’s Principal Executive
Staff revised the Parental Leave
policy last month, granting more
generous leave time for childbirth
and adoption to staff and faculty
members. The new policies are ef-
fective as of August 1, 2004.

According Director of Human
Resources Carl Sorenson, “the policy
was enhanced in order to be true to
our values of promoting family and
community.”

In the past, both female and male
faculty members with tenure or ona
probationary contract were allotted
a one course reduction during the
academic year of the birth or adop-
tion with no reduction in pay. They
could drop one additional course with
a 10 percent reduction in pay.

The revised policy distinguishes
between male and female faculty
members, granting mothers a more
liberal leave policy than before. Fe-

male faculty members now receive a
two course reduction in course-load
with no reduction in pay and the
option of dropping an additional
course with a 10 percent pay reduc-
tion as before.

Additionally, the tenure clock will
now automatically be delayed by one
year unless the female faculty mem-

ber requests otherwise and receives

approval from department and dean.
The policies regarding male faculty
parental leave remained unchanged.

In accordance with the Family
Medical Leave Act, all staff members
automatically receive 12 weeks of
unpaid parental leave for the birth or
adoption of a child.

However, after the revision, non-
exempt hourly employees are now
eligible for ten days of paid parental
leave in addition to any sick and
vacation days they may have accu-
mulated. This change puts them ona
more even starting point as exempt
employees, the professional and

awards, and Dennis Appleyard,
James B. Duke Professor of Interna-
tional Studies and Professor and
Chair of Economics, was awarded
the Thomas Jefferson Award for ex-
ceptional teaching.

In her speech, Edelman spoke pri-
marily about the problems facing
America’s children.

“Adults are the problem facing
children,” she said.

According to Edelman, the lack of
attention and participation of adults
in their children’s education contrib-
utes to problems.

Edelman also said that adults

should help to “pull up the moral
weeds” of violence and materialism
in America.
- Edelman invoked former slave and
abolitionist Sojourner Truth twice for
metaphors regarding the people’s
need and ability to change govern-
ment.

Edelman said that there were
“seven weasels” in society that
worked against positive change.

She spoke of special interest, in-

Political organizations contest
key issues in historical debate

By Liz Barry
Senior Staff Writer

With the Presidential election just
days away, political fervor height-
ened on campus Saturday evening
when the College Republicans and
Young Democrats debated key po-
litical issues from the balconies of
Philanthropic and Eumenean halls.

_ The debaters contested issues
ranging from education and fiscal
policy to stem cell research and for-
eign affairs. The event’s historic set-
ting reflected the long-standing tra-
dition of formalized campus debate,
dating back to the nineteenth century
when members of the Philanthropic
and Eumenan literary societies de-
bated from their respective balconies.

A respectful and enthusiastic au-
dience of students, parents and com-
munity members crowded the lawn
between the two halls. Also in atten-
dance were several high profile po-
litical leaders and reporters from the
local channel News 14 Carolina.

“Tt was very brave of all the stu-
dents who spoke here today to do
this,” said Charlene Barshefsky,
former U.S. Trade Representative
and mother of Mari Cohen ’05.
“There was a lot of pressure and both
sides were very well-prepared.”

Pat McCrory, mayor of Charlotte

and uncle of Wilson McCrory ’07,
said the arguments from both sides
impressed him, even those contrary
to his own political views.

“From a political science view
point, I thought both sides presented
their debates extremely well andina
very professional way,” he said. “I
have a great hope for our students to
stand as future leaders of our coun-

The debate, moderated by Associ-
ate Professor of Political Science Pat
Sellers, followed a strict format in
which each side presented opening
and closing statements, answered
eight questions-submitted by their
opponents and were allowed no more
than three rebuttals.

Young Democrats President Tay-
lor Ansley ’07 opened with remarks
that called for achange of leadership,
citing what he considered President
Bush’s political shortcomings and
Senator Kerry’s leadership strengths.

“We are blessed to have a candi-
date who sees the promise of a united
America and the strength of work-
ing with our allies, domestic and in-
ternational,” he said. “We are blessed
with a candidate who considers the
issues carefully and makes decisions
based on sound policy, not blind ide-
ology.”

With an opening statement that

provided a personal glimpse into the
9/11 terrorist attacks, College Repub-
licans Vice President Jack Hubbard
’06 praised Bush’s solidarity in in-
ternational and domestic affairs over
the past four years.

“President Bush led our country in
a clear and decisive manner through
very troubling times,” he said. “He
has also come to the realization that
waiting for threats to materialize is
no longer an option in a post 9/11
world.”

Amid passionate and forceful ex-
amination of the issues at hand were’
lighter moments, which prompted
chuckles from many audience mem-
bers. College Republicans President
Joseph Adams ’06 made jest of an
elaborately framed question on
homeland security that included five
sub-questions.

“I’m glad to see that we got to ask
eight questions and the Young Demo-
crats got to ask 8,000 questions,” he
said.

The students’ powerful conclud-
ing remarks illuminated the themes
that resonated throughout the debate.

Gagan Gupta ’07, representing the
Young Democrats, said that Kerry is
the leader most qualified to protect
America at home and restore our
credibility abroad.
