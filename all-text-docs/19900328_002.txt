“Cosby” consultant addresses
stress in Black men vs. women

By ARMANDO JOSE
SANCHEZ-ABALLI

Alvin Poussaint, a noted psychiatrist
and also a script consultant for two in-
novative television programs, “The
Cosby Show” and “A Different World,”
presented a lecture Monday which
highlighted the distinguishing dynam-
ics evolving between Black males and
females.

Noted for his work on issues ranging
from stress to the impact of racism on
the Black psyche, Poussaint is Associate
Professor of Psychiatry and Associate
Dean for Student Affairs at Harvard
Medical School. The Committee on
Public Lectures and the Black Student
Coalition co-sponsored the event.

Poussaint revealed the motivations
involved behind the creation of some of
the characters on the shows he consults
as well as addressing critical issues fac-
ing the Black students on today’s col-
lege campuses.

According to Poussaint, many stud-
ies that have explored the plight of the
Blacks and their assimilation into soci-
ety have been obscured because they
have neglected to differentiate between

Women's concerns

male and female experiences. Tracing
this facet of the Black experience from
its roots in the Civil War era to the
present, Poussaint unearths a dramatic
contrast between the experiences of
both sexes.

This difference accounts for the in-
adequacy of social programs to effec-
tively identify and help alleviate the
problems confronting Black men and
women. Citing “The Cosby Show” as
being sensitive to this component of the
Black experience, Poussaint disclosed
the intricate detail which entailed the
formation of the characters. In order for
social programs to adequately assist
Blacks, he believes that this element
must be observed.

Concluding the lecture by fielding
questions from the audience, Poussaint
shared his insight and experience on
two key issues with which minority
students at Davidson are confronted.
One is the pressure to integrate into the
majority while attempting to maintain
one’s sense of identity and culture.
“This feat sometimes produces acute
feelings of anxiety and confusion”
claimed Poussaint, “and causes some

“The Women’s Concerns
Committee is not a group of
bra-burning radical feminists,”
assures Sandra Smith, the
committee’s new chairperson.
Instead, the committee is “de-
voted to increasing awareness
of woman’s issues both on and
off campus, as well as empha-
sizing the need for action,” she
stated.

Smith wishes to create a
“humanistic atmosphere”
where she hopes to involve
both male students and male
faculty in the predominately
female committee. “It’s impor-
tant to remember that these is-
sues_both_directly_and_indi-
rectly concern both sexes,” she
says.

Smith is concerned with es-

tablishing a cohesive commit-
tee that will act as a feedback
group for the students where
they can meet to share concerns
and discuss women’s issues.

She will also strive to accom- -

plish several campus-wide ob-
jectives, such as increasing po-
litical awareness in the field of
women’s concerns. The com-
mittee will keep up to date on
abortion and other legislation
of interest to women’s con-
cerns.

Smith plans to expand the
committee’s association with
the faculty, who have recently
announced the approval of a
Gender Studies program at
Davidson. Other goals for the
future include several letter
writing campaigns on issues
such as abortion and sexual
abuse and possible involve-

After 17 years at Davidson, Jackie Hughes
of campus police to retire

By HARIN de SILVA

Davidson’s police chief
Jackie Hughes retires after 17
years of service this week.
Hughes has served the college
since the inception of its police
force in 1978. He has also func-
tioned as the chief law-enforce-
ment officer for the Davidson
community since 1973. How-
ever his association with
Davidson goes back much fur-

ther -- almost 28 years.
Hughes recalled that until
1973 when Davidson opened
its doors to women, no law
enforcement officer had been
_ presenton campus. He pointed
‘out that the need for a campus
police force had arisen with the

first date-rape reported at
Davidson in 1973. The last case
reported to campus police took
place five years ago, he said.
However, that is no indication
of the incidence of date-rape at
Davidson, he added. Date-rape
doesoccur butis most often not
reported, he stated.

According to Hughes, the
Davidson campus is otherwise
extremely safe. At least two
officers patrol the campus at
night while mostof the campus
is well-lit. Moreover, the cam-
pus is not often frequented by
strangers.

Hughes said that the most
satisfying aspect of his associa-
tion with Davidson was that he

had contributed to making
Davidson the safe place it is
now. No officer has ever had to
use his weapon, he reported
proudly. The fact that the last
serious offence occurred five
years ago bears testimony to
the excellent job done by
Hughes and his team.

Commenting on the type of
crime committed at Davidson,
Hughes said that the most seri-
ous case he had handled in-
volved a student being shot
several years ago. A stolen car
was another major crime that
he recalled.

About Davidson’s alcohol
policy, Hughes remarked that
those in charge of alcohol on

Patterson Court were doing a
commendable job. Although
he admitted that minors often

consumed alcohol, the situ-

ation has never gotten out of
hand. aiid

He and his team had never
had to make citations regard-
ing the consumption of alcohol
by minors to State authorities.
Hughes strongly believes that
Davidson has no alcohol prob-
