or fifth in conference. I think
fifth’s pretty realistic. We’ ve got
to work together. Suzy’s going
to be great, but the rest of us
have got to stay close to each
other and try to move up closer
to her (Burr),” captain Beth
Brewster said. “We have solid
times far behind hers, and we
have a lot more depth.”

The team opens at Appala-
chian State next weekend, and
coach Beth Puckett says their
goals will get more specific af-
ter that,

“Right now we want to fin-
ishat least sixth, which is up one
spot from last year,” she added.

Puckett says there will be a
battle for the second spot on the
team between Brewster, co-cap-
tain Kelly Kiefer,: Janet
Aardema, and Allison Curran.
Having so many people jockey-
ing for a spot evinces their in-
creased depth.

“Tt’s almost the same team
from last year, but we’re a year
stronger. We’ll be better than
last year,” Puckett claimed.

' The influx of five fresh-
men, highlighted by Curran, will
also help the team.

“We have so many more
runners than last year,” Brewster
said. ‘Just the numbers are go-
ing to help everybody giving
each other support.”

Brewster hopes the team
will beat Marshall and ETSU,
and doesn’t think knocking off
WCU is an unreachable goal.
She also said they can win their
sole home meet of the season,
Oct. 5 against Campbell, UNCA,
Wofford, Winthrop.

“We ran strong against
those teams last year, and we’ll
be used to the course and the
hills,” she said. “We hope we
can win that meet.”

“If you see us running, try
to cheer,” Curran requested.

“We have a lot more speed in the

definitely have more depth.”
