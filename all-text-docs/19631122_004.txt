Now that the III’s have finished their six hours work in the field for the semes-

that the Juniors will go to Ft. Bragg much better prepared for the tactical exercises

with an objective at the end of
each manned by combat-harden-
ed IV's, skilled fighters with six

The biggest problem encoun

the difficulty in controlling as

the thickness of the woods.

By the time the patrols rotat-

the new experience.

The difference between the

the second one was truly amaz-

ballot at Los Angeles in 1960.

Lyndon B. Johnson. the new
President, was one of Kennedy's
closest contenders for the 1960
nomination. Following his loss to
Kennedy, he agreed to leave his
post as Senate Majority Leader
to ‘run for vice-president.

Jobnson, 55, has been cailed
one of the most capable men
ever to serve as majority leader.
In spite of a record of heart
trouble that included one heart
attack, he conducted a vigorous
campaign in 1960.

Most observers characterize
Johnson as a moderate, neither
a southern conservative nor the

the South,” Dean John
Bevan told me Monday.

But the ex-Davidson professor
who left here in 1959 to set up
the curriculum at Florida Pres-
byterian, a school that will grad-
uate its first class this year,
would not point out the weak-
nesses that he felt thus far had
kept us from obtaining that en-
viable position. ‘You must un-
derstand,” he smiled, “that I
still have a lot of friends here.”

Bevan would say that he
thought the self-evalustion of
Davidson being led by Dr. C. J.
Pietenpol could help this col-
lege make progress in the field
of education:

‘T had a talk with Dr. Pieten-
pol and left some suggestions
with him. I also urged him to
travel over the entire country
and talk with professors of lead-
ing institutions and get ideas

from them that might be intro- .

duced at Davidson. It's all right
to talk with administrators, but
the professors are the only ones
who know enough about various
programs to be of any real
value.”

Bevan did not wish to make
public any suggestions for
changes in the Davidson pro-
gram because he felt that only
those people who in the erd
must live and work with the
changes should make such decis-
ions. He evidently did not want
anyone here to feel that he was
trying to force his ideas on
Davidson.

But he did mention several

Tt is quite interesting to note
that one Presbyterian school, at
least, does not require religion.
It is also interesting to observe
the fact that Davidson receives

tution that gets a very high per-
centage of support from Presby-
terianism does not try to cram
religion down its student’s
throats.

Bevan explained the reason
for such liberality at this echool.
It is really a very simple ex-
planation. “The trustees and the
faculty got together for three
days to approve the final pro
gram. They were really at one
another’s throsts part of the
time. Some of the ministers
would lean over and pound the
table, but the professors would

lean over and pound right back.”

to travel to a foreign country to
do some type of study. “When a
student goes overseas, he has to
know that language he has stud-
ied here,” smiled Bevan. “Of
course, some of our students go
to England. We once had 2
group who went to study the
history of London.”

Bevan said he felt there “was
a certain spirit of aliveness’’
one could feel among the Fiori-
da Presbyterian student body.
He admitted one thing that
might help is the fact that al-
most half the students are
women.

The fact that such a spirit can
exist might seem strange to the
Davidson student who spends
most of hie spare time “up the

SHOULD AULD ACQUAINTANCE
AND JAZZ LIKE THAT

T am now an elderly gentleman, full of years and aches, but
my thoughts keep ever turning to my undergraduate days. This
is called “arrested development.”

But I cannot stop the healing tide of nostalgia that washes
over me as I recall those golden campus days, those ivy-covered
buildings (actually, at my college, there was only ivy: no bricks),
those pulse-tingling lectures on John Dryden and Cotton
Mather, the many friends I made, the many deans I bit.

I know some of you are already dreading the day when you
graduate and lose touch with all your merry classmates. It is
my pleasant task today to assure you that it need not be 60;
all you have to do is join the Alumni Association and every year
you will receive a bright, newsy, chatty bulletin, chock-full of
tidings about your old buddies.

Oh, what a red-letter. day it is at my house, the day the
Alumni Bulletin arrives! I cancel all my engagements, take the
phone off the hook, dismiss my resident osteopath, put the
cheetah outside, and settle down for an evening of pure pleasure
with the Bulletin and (need I add?) a good supply of Marlboro
Cigarettes.

Whenever I am having fun, 1 Marlboro makes the fun even
more fun. That filter, that flavor, that yielding soft pack, that
firm Flip Top box, never fails to heighten my pleasure whether
I am playing Double Canfield or watching the radio or knitting
an afghan or enjoying any other diverting pursuit you might
name—except, of course, spear fishing. But then, how much
spear fishing does one do in Clovis, New Mexico, where I live?

But I digress. Let us return to my Alumni Bulletin and the
fascinating news about my old friends and classmates. I quote
from the current issue:

“Well, fellow slums, it certainly has been a wing-dinger of a
year for us old grads! Remember Mildred Cheddar and Harry
Camembert, those crazy kids who always held hands in Econ IT?
Well, they’re married now and living in Clovis, New Muxo,
where Harry rents spear-fishing equipment, and Mildred has just
given birth to a lovely 28-pound daughter, her second in four
months. Nice going, Mildred and Harry!

“Remember Jethro Brie, the man we voted most likely to
succeed? Well, old Jethro is still gathering laurels! Last week
he was voted ‘Motorman of the Year’ by his fellow workers in
the Duluth streetcar system. ‘I owe it all to my brakeman,’
said Jethro in a characteristically modest acceptance speech.
Same old Jethro!

“Probably the most glamorous time had by any of us old
alums was had by Francis Macomber last year. He went on a
big game hunting safari all the way to Africa! We received many
interesting post cards from Francis until he was, alas, acci-
dentally shot and killed by his wife and white hunter. Tough
luck, Francis!

“Wilametta ‘Deadeye’ Macomber, widow of the late beloved
Francis Macomber, was married yesterday to Fred ‘Sureshot’
Sigafoos, white hunter, in a simple double-ring ceremony in
Nairobi. Many happy returns, Wilametta and Fred!

“Well, alums, that just alout wraps it up for this year.
Buy bonds!’
