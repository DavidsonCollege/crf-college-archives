(Continued from Page 2)
The memorable game with Carolina of
the 1920 season will linger long in the minds
of all who saw that superb game. It was
during that game and the one with Furman
on Thanksgiving that Hammett reached the
apex of his football playing ability and he
lived up to his reputation in every way. He
was in every play, and he was an important
part in the crew that wrecked the hopes of
Carolina by a 7-0 victory. The game with
Furman was hotly contested but was lost.
This brilliant linesman did his part in every
way and thus ended a most successful foot-
pall career.

Hammett was popular on the campus, hav-
ing filled a number of responsible positions
in the Student Body. He was a member
of the vigilance committee ‘and also a mem-
ber of the Athletic Council. A college hon-
or in the shape of a membership to the O.
D. K. fraternity was bestowed upon him,
he being also a member of the S. A. E.
fraternity. For two years he played cla
baseball, not making a letter in the Varsity.

Hammett’s football ability’ was no match
against the wiles of Dan Cupid, though,
and in 1921 he married Miss May Lignon of
Anderson, S. C., his home town. At present
he is the Vice-President of the Chituola Cot-
ton Mills of Belton, S. C., and is rapidly
rising in the commercial life he has chosen.
