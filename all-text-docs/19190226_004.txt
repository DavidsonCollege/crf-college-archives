With the Alumni

What may be deemed a remarkable
recognition of the abilities of two Da-
vidson graduates was shown in the re-
cent call extended by the Grace Cove-
nant Memorial Presbyterian church, of
Richmond, Va., to Rev. Chas. L. King,
‘14, to become pastor, and Rev. Marion
A. Bogps, 't5,.to become associate pas-
tor of that church. Remarking on this
unusual call, “Phe Richmond Virginian
stated that “the interest in this action is
threefold, because Grace Covenant is the
largest Presbyterian church in’ Rich-
mond, because it is almost, if not quite,
unprecedented for a congregation to call
two pastors at one meeting, and because
of the youthfulness and unusual promise
of the two men who were called.”

Both young men are recent graduates
of Davidson and have attended Union
Seminary. Mr. King came to David-
son from Covington, Ga., and during his
course here represented the college in
intercollegiate debating and took a
prominent part in all student. activities.

In addition to his many honors won aty

Davidson, he won the Moses D. Hoge
fellowship for post-graduate study at
Union Seminary last yedr, Mr. Boggs
is now tn his senior year at Union. He
came. to Davidson fron Liberty, S$. C.,
ind closed his fourth year with a splen-
did record. “These two young men have
the hearty congratulations from every
Davidson alumnus and the best wishes
of all for their success in’ this splendid
field.

be the first ‘Victory Reunion!’ Great
