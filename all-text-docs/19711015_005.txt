LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Burney Blitzed For ROTC Column

To The Editor:

I am a conscientious objector
and it should logically follow
that I would concur with Cecil
Burney’s proposal in the Oct. 8
DAVIDSONIAN edition to abol-
ish the ROTC program from
Davidson College. That is not
the case.

I feel that the disappearance
of the ROTC program from
Davidson would have a detri-
mental effect on our college,
the individual student, the army
and our country.

We must retain the spirit of
freedom of opinion at David-
son. That freedom is necessary
because we should know what
our opponents have to say, pre-
ferably first hand.

Freedom of discussion im-
proves our own position.
Through that discussion we are
better qualified to assess our
own polemical strengths and
weaknesses as well as those of
our opponents.

As a result we are better
equipped to attack our adver-
sary's stand. The liberty of all
men is our vital necessity.

There comes a time when the
freedom of others is no longer
a question of their right, but a
question of our need. To eradi-
cate an individual or an organ:
ization because we are in dis-
agreement with them is to re-
pudiate the search for truth and
freedom that Davidson should
encourage.

Without acquainting ourselves
thoroughly with the object of
our criticism we become ignor-
ant of the truth. For that rea-
son, man must cherish and pro-
tect liberty as a means of ad-
vancing the discovery of truth.

To inspire the adoption of
our point of view by the remov-
al of those with whom we dis-
agree is but the subtie adop-
tion of conformity and the utill-

War Of Your Own?

zation of means other than dem-
ocratic. Totalitarian rulers do
not consider it necessary to
tolerate any opposition — they
eliminate ft.

In the Joe McCarthy era of
our own United States, rational
thinking and the basic freedoms
of our country were abridged
by a few men’s emotionalism
and many men's silent acqui-
escence. Consequently a reign
of conformity settled over our
country.

Is Davidson College to suc-
cumb to a “liberal” conformity
at the expense of the spirit of
freedom of opinion?

Davidson College should re-
tain the ROTC program be-
cause of the program's contri-
bution to the diversity of ideo}-
ogical opportunity that it of-
fers the individual. Mr. Burney
stated that those who enter the

program ‘‘don’t think very
much.” That statément has
some merit.

i entered West Point as an
unquestioning, politically naive,
and morally unstable person.
The multitude of experiences
that | went through up there
brought me to the sincere con-
clusion that 1 was misplaced.
| did not belong at West Point
because | was a conscientious
objector.

The same moral convictions
that brought me to the attain-
ment of my C.O. status existed
prior to my attendance at the
Point. However, it took unique
experience of the United States
Military Academy to make me
realize exactly how I felt.

I knew others at the Point
who came to the same conclu-
sion I did as a result of their
exposure there. I know of stiil
others who began or went
through their ROTC program
and who felt their convictions
towards life emerge.

Is Davidson College to deny
the individual that important
ideological opportunity?

Davidson should retain the
ROTC program because of the
damage the abolishment of the
program could do to the Army
and the country itself. Unfor-
tunately the Army is a neces-
sary institution. Fortunately it
is not an independent organiza-
tion but, in Thoreau’s words,
“only an arm of the standing
government.”

However, a narrow-minded,
dogmatic Army is not neces:
sary. Such an Army would be
a jeopardy to our country. To
prevent that type of Army there
is a need for those men In the
Army who possess the belief in
the basic freedoms of our na-
tlon, not the least of which Is
the freedom of opinion.

I believe that Davidson pos-
scsses men of that stature. For
those whose consciences allow
them to enter the Army, let
them. However, let us hope that
the spirit of the freedoms of our
United States enters with them.

When I was at West Point,
we were given question and an-
swer opinions with our Tactical
Officers. One cadet asked his
Tac what he should do if he
was given an order that vio-
lated his conscience.

The officer replied that he
didn’t give a damn what a troop-
er’s convictions or morals were,
when he gave an order that or-
der had best be obeyed .. . or
else.

An Army composed solely of
this type of man? Frightening
isn't it?

Woodrow Wilson said these
words in 1896 at the time of the
Princeton Sesquicentennial:

“t have had sight of the per-
fect place of learning in. my
thought: a free place, and a
various, where no men could be

and not know with how great
a destiny knowledge had come
into the world. A place where
to hear the truth about the
past and hold debate about the
affairs of the present, with
knowledge and without passion;
like the world in having men‘s
life at heart, a place for men
and all that concerns them.
Who shall show us the way fo
this place?”

It is my hope, and I trust it
is yours, that people may say
that Davidson College is that
place.

To The Editor:

Unless you are an absolute
moron, it is difficult to miss
the point of a Cecil Burney col-
umn; this past week’s column
on ROTC was no exception. In
ho uncertain terms, Cecil made
his position quite clear.

Since, in arguing a point, one
generally overstates one’s case,
it is quite understandable that
Cecil may have said some
things which he doesn’t whole-
heartedly believe or which are
not actually so.

For example, I have a bro-
ther who is a sophomore at Fur-
man University and who is a
pre-med student.

He has seriously considered
entering the ROTC program at
Furman so that he would be
eligible for a program (spon-
sored by none other than the
United States Army) which
would help finance him through
medical school.

I know my brother quite well
from our years of association,
and I sincerely believe that he
has made a real attempt to
understand his own feelings, to
formulate his opinions, and to
act for himself: furthermore, I
consider neither his rational de-
cisions nor his actions based on
those decisions to be infantile,
moronic, or stupid.

And he certainly doesn’t have
the “killer instinct’ except per-
haps for the few times when he
has felt like causing me griev-
ous personal injury.

Incidentally, neither his fa-
ther nor his grandfather was an
officer in any military estab-
tishment.

Similar examples can be
found here at Davidson. ROTC
is not all bad, as some naive
reader of Mr. Burney’s column
might have been led to believe.

In fact, as a faute de mieux
solution to an otherwise insup-
erable quandary, it is extreme.

To The Editor:

My first reaction to Cecil
Burney's most recent column in
THE DAVIDSONIAN, “The
American Army Plays Fun and
Games on Campus,” was one
of rage, not only because be
slandered me personally as an
ROTC Cadet, but also because
he twisted and distorted the
image of an institution which is
important to me.

However, my rage was soon
displaced by an intent to re-
spond to the article. I’m afraid
that Burney has seriously dam-
aged his reputation as a serious,

thoughtful, and judicious indiv-
idual through this column.

The article reeks of unsup-
ported, illogical statements. The
idea that ROTC is one of the
institutions that make wars hap-
pen is preposterous.

Burney’s understanding of the
purpose of ROTC drill is com-
pletely incorrect. He implies
that the college is paying for
the ROTC progrem when, in
reality, the U.S. Army bears
the burden.

Burney does not stop with
wild unfounded statements. In
the grand style of the 19th Cen-
tury muckrakers, he descends
into the realm of personal in-
vective. He unequivocably
groups all ROTC Cadets as un-
thinking, insensitive, and im-
mature children who have to
be lured into the program.

I reject this statement purely
on the basis of knowledge of
myself and my fellow cadets.
Burney’s characterization of the
ROTC cadre as regressed flat-
heads brings to mind a ques-
tion.

When was the last time that
he spoke at length with any of
the staff members? My person-
al experience with the cadre
shows them to be intelligent.
aware individuals.

Finally, in the very worst way
possible, Burney maligns a fel-
low student and campus leader.

The article is climaxed by an
extremely poor and distasteful
attempt to emotionalize the is-
sue beyond the reach of reason
and sound judgment.

The tales of Dok-Lo and the
nameless young man, admitted-
ly, are sad and unfortunate,
though they are obvious fabric-
ations of someone's imagina-
tion.

However, they are irrelevant
to the issue and do not belong
in a serious column.

Apparently, Burney’s main
point, however hidden it may
be, is that the college commu-
nity must rid itself of ROTC if
for no other reason that Bur-
ney has so decreed and because
of the fact that many good
parking spaces are occupied by
staff cars.

In my mind, ROTC is no dif-
ferent from any other special-
ized academic program such as
the South-East Asia Program,
the Honors College, or the JYA
Program.

All are voluntary and all] re.
main on campus because of
Student interest. When there is
no longer a sufficient number
of interested students to justify
the continuance of the ROTC
Program, that is the time that.
it should be dropped.

Until then, it is suggested that
Burney attempt to develop that
virtue known as tolerance nad
that he practice self-restraint.

In short, the column is a monu-
ment to poor taste, to rabid, un.
reasoned thought, and to irra-
tional sensationalism. Burney
thereby besmirches both him-
self and the newspaper for
which he writes.
