SGA States Policy
On Appropriations

For Organizations

By TOM BRUCE

Staff Writer

An unusually short SGA Sen.
ate meeting on Tuesday served
to clarify senate policy on ap-
propriating funds for various
groups that petition the Senate.

An amendment proposed by
junior senator Bill Meier was
passed to the effect that no
funds from the student govern-
ment treasury shall be dispen-
sed to any organization until
the group has made ‘‘every
reasonable effort’ to secure
the funds from other relevant
sources.

Meier indicated that this was
to prevent groups from _ ap-
proaching the Senate for money
everytime a project is suggest-
ed.

The amendment also provid-
ed that Senate committees need
not poll other sources for ap-
propriations, since this money
is already provided in the year-
ly senate budget.

After approving the Young
Socialist for Freedom request
for SGA chartering, the senate
set dates for upcoming com-
mittee reports on the future of
the Union, subsidized athletics,
and constitutional revision.

Senior Cecil Burney suggest-
ed that a “‘library design task-
force” be assembled immedi-
ately to propose alternatives to
the library plans recently sub-
mitted to the Trustees. Burney
Stated that the committee might
include a host of faculty mem-
bers who were opposed to the
designs.

Student body-president Dan-
ny Clodfelter announced that he
will submit a request for mem-
bership dues in the National
Student Association (NSA), a

move that was endorsed by the
student body in a referendum
on Tuesday. Debate on the re-
quest will begin next Tuesday
at the senate meeting.

Senior Class President Bill
Lear apologized to the assem-
bled senators for the fact that
Tuesday's election results, re-
garding new voting representa-
tives in the Senate from Grey
House and off-campus, were in
doubt.

He explained that the new
senate seats should have been
considered separately on the
ballot, instead of collectively as
they appeared. He stated that
a Thursday election would be
held to clear up the dispute.

Sexist “Taming Of The Shrew’ Ends
By Reaffirming Male’s Dominance

By RUSS MERRITT
and
BOBBY ALLEN

That “The Taming of the
Shrew" is an excellent piece of
drama has been evidenced in
playhouses throughout the West-
ern world. That it is an accept-
able play for the Davidson cam-
pus, however, is another ques-
tion.

Such is the immediate re-
sponse to the college drama de-
partment’s fall production of
Shakespeare's classic battle of
the sexes which ends with a
moralistic reaffirmation of male
dominance.

Of course. it can be pointed
out that such attitudes were an
essential part of the Elizabethan

society for which Shakespeare
wrote. but the male domination
of seventeenth century England
hardly needs” reinforcing in
twentieth century America. and
particularly Davidson.

It is a part of Shakesneare’s
genuis, however, that one can
overlook the didacticism of the
play and appreciate its ribald.
rollicking humor. And the
Davidson production maintains
this high level of entertain
ment. In fact. it’s a jolly good
time for any audience.

The fun and enjoyment of the
play. however. are not accom
plished without encountering
some obstacles. not the
of which is the theatre itself,
Hodson Hall. being built origin-
ally for musical rather than
dramatic performances. tends
to emphasize the separation of
Stage and audience, actor and
spectator.

Peter Lutkin'’s tiered setting,
while providing a suitable plat-
form for the action of the pllay,
tended also to thrust the action
even further from the audience.
The setting furthermore made
a necessary physical sense of
intimacy impossible, hamper
ing the full impact of Shake
speare’s rich dialogue.

The props. too, at times serv
ed more as hinderances than
as aids to the tale. Stick horses
in the famous “‘sun and moon”
scene, unnecessary signs identi-
fying various parts of the stage
as residences, and other near
farcical props were detracting
attempts at unnecessary real
ism in an otherwise abstract
sitting.

In terms of entertainment,
however. such mechanical pro-
blems were overshadowed by
the vitality of the production
and the vibrant spirit of the
cast.

Rupert Barber, the director,
handled the cast well and his
firm hand was obvious as the
actors moved about the stage
with ease. He also chose wise-
ly in playing to the hilt the

The other argument the ad-

is that it is inherent in the con-
