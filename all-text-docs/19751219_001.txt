Its a Lions Club den now

Currie, Scott plan to reopen Rusk

Business Manager Robert Currie
and ARA Slater Director Ron Scott
are working on plans for reopening
Rusk House next year.

Last year, Rusk served along with
Richards and Bailey Houses as a
cafeterias for students using Slater
Food Service.

Rusk was a_ buffeteria allowing
students to eat as much as they
wanted for a fixed price.

Scott made the decision to close
Rusk last spring.

and on Parents’ Weekend for the
Parents’ Council Breakfast.

The house is also the meeting place
for the Davidson Lion’s Club, a civic
organization.

“Last year the Club had been
meeting out at the lake but ap-
proached us about meeting in Rusk,
and of course the college was more
than glad to throw a little business
Slater’s way,’’ commented Currie.

“By catering to other groups Slater
is able to keep down the cost of meal
tickets to the students,” concluded
Currie.

This plan could coincide with a year
round training table for athletes that
is now being discussed with Athletic
Director Tom Cartmill.

“We might have a problem with the
super-maxi during football season
since the team practically fills up the
entire room, but we might be able to
squeeze in about fifty more people,”
said Scott.

The possibility of turning Rusk into
another eating club to alleviate
crowded conditions on Patterson

At one time the possibility of Slater
setting up an eating club in Rusk was
discussed.

“It would take about seventy to
eighty people to start a club, and
there simply doesn’t seem to be
enough interest,” concluded Scott.

Scott also said that the two
off-campus fraternities, Sigma Phi
Epsilon and Phi Gamma Delta, had
approached him about Slater catering

Professors discuss tenure;
Express differing opinions

By BILL BARNES
Senior News Editor

The conferral of academic
tenure upon a professor “‘re-
quires evidence of demons-
trated professional compe-
tence, service to the academic
community, and commitment
to the welfare of the College,’’
according to the Davidson
College Constitution.

Its purpose, said Dean of
the Honors Center Earl R.
MacCormac, “is to provide a
position from which a profes-
sor may, with ‘‘impunity’’,
voice controversial and/or un-
popular views within his or her
field of competence.

Tenure also, according to its
critics, tends to “lock-in” a
college faculty, restricting the
circulation of professors with-
in the college and university
system and the entrance of
“new blood’ into a school’s
faculty. In some cases, its
conferral also precedes a de-
cline in the academic stand-
ards of professors who, once
their tenure is established,
begin to take less and less care
in their position.

“To understand anyone’s
position on tenure requires a
knowledge of the basic contro-
versy,”’ said Professor of
Spanish Lois A. Kemp. ‘‘The
problem is partly one of mob-
ility, partly one of a loss of
distinctiveness in a college
whose faculty is to an extent
frozen in place by tenure.

“Look at it this way,” she
continued. ‘The whole teach-
ing profession has undergone
some basic changes. Up until
about ten years ago there was
a lot of faculty mobility;
faculty turnover might be ten
or 15 percent per year. People
would change jobs with better
offers being offered and not
that many stayed any one
place long enough to get
tenure.

‘“‘What’s happening now

with the economic difficulties
and the fact that professors
are being paid better, and as
the size of the job market has
shrunk people no longer move.

We are moving towards an
immobile faculty. People are
getting tenure at a younger
age and they’re going to be at
whatever school given it to
them for 30 years and more.’’

Kemp received tenure from
Davidson College last spring,
but does not favor it as an
unconditional policy. The
“locking-in”’ of professors into
tenured posts can cause a
college to lose any distinctive-
ness it derives from continued
influx of new talent.

“You need new blood in a
college,” said Kemp, ‘‘and
with a locked-in faculty you
aren’t going to get it. It
should not be an unconditional
policy and the faculty’s cred-
entials should be subject to
review as much after tenure is
given as before.”

Regarding the allegation
that ‘the conferral of tenure
results in a decline in profes-
sorial excellence, Kemp said:
-“If a student had been here
two years and proven himself
adequate and were guaranteed
a passing grade for the re-
mainder of his stay at David-
son, what would happen?

In some cases there would
be a definite.loss of incentive,

but in many others the stu-
dents would continue to do the
same work. they had been
doing before and better. The

-same applies to professors.”’

Dean of the Honors Center
Earl MacCormac holds that
tenure is a valid and viable
system. “It provides an at-
mosphere of freedom which
would not otherwise exist,’’ he
said, ‘‘in which professors are
freed from having to worry

_about their jobs if they voice
* unpopular views.’

MacCormac suggests that
tenure be given, not on the
present seven-year plan, but
on the basis of a ten-year stay
at the College, with evalua-
tions after each of two five-
year periods and re-evaluation
once tenure is conferred. As of
now, the College Constitution
says that tenure cannot be
repealed once given unless in
cases of ‘“‘mental incapacity,
professional competence, or
extreme moral turpitude.”

Both he and Kemp suggest
that post-conferral evalua-
tions be made by teams of
outside observers who should
be made familiar with the
college and its purposes. This
practice, though somewhat
costly, has been instituted
with success at Allegheny
College in Pennsylvania.

The bringing in of outside
and impartial observers would
aid in the clarification of the
terms ‘‘professional compet-
ence’. and ‘extreme moral
turpitude’, as well as struc-
ture the process of conferral of
tenure so that it can be known
when and how a professor is
being evaluated.

Neither Kemp nor MacCor-
mac know exactly how they
were evaluated. “I was given
tenure after ten years and
have a letter to prove it,’’ said
MacCormac. MacCormac,

College continues
laundry business
with mandatory fee

By PHILIP DUNCAN
Staff Writer

“Two years ago, we were
interested in terminating oper-
ation of the College-owned

laundry. This proposal has.

now been rejected,”’ said Da-
vidson College President Sam-
uel R. Spencer Jr.

One important condition
stands in the way.

“Before the College laundry
was closed, we wanted insur-
ance that some similar service
would be available to David-
son students. No commercial
laundry was then or since has
been willing to locate in the
Davidson area. Because no
one else will operate a laundry,
the College must,” said Spen-
cer.

All Davidson students must
pay a mandatory fee to the
laundry. Some have protested,
insisting that they can do their
own for less money.

Those who are dissatisfied
want to see the laundry fee
made voluntary.

Spencer points out that ‘‘the
flat fee is necessary, for the
laundry must have a guaran-
teed operating income or it will
become a financial burden on
the College.

“The choice is not between a

voluntary or a non-voluntary
laundry, rather the choice is
between our present set-up or
no laundry at all,’’ said Spen
cer.

Mrs. Francis Beaver, 31
year employee and now direc-
tor of the Davidson laundry,
participated in a feasibility
study of the operation two
years ago.

“If the College terminated
laundry service and no com-
mercial laundry was available
to replace it, coin-operated
washers and driers would be
needed to meet the students’
needs,’ said Beaver.

Beaver sees almost endless
disadvantages in making 1250
students dependent upon coin-
operated ‘machines, and ad-
ministration officials agree
with her.

“Even now our laundry has
