David Brown

After graduating .with a
Bachelor’s Degree from Berry Col-
lege in Georgia, Brown went on to
receive his Ph.D. in Synthetic Or-
ganic Chemistry from Emory Uni-
versity in Atlanta in 1986.

Following graduate school,
Brown began working for Hoechst
Celanese Corporation in Rhode Is-
land. The Hoechst parent com-
pany, based in Frankfurt, Germany,

isthe world’s largest chemical com-

pany in the world.

There, Brown received an edu-
cation in the chemical industry and
spent 11 years working as a re-
search chemist and supervising and
aiding interns. In 1989, Brown
transferred to Charlotte and contin-
ued his. success -with Hoechst
Celanese.

But Brown realized his job
wasn’t as perfect as he once be-
lieved it to be.

“The further I climbed up (the
corporate ladder), the further I got
from the students and interns,” he
said.

“T love to help them bring their
projects together, and after 11 years
in the industry, I'd had enough.”

With that realization, Brown
left his job at Hoechst Celanese and
joined the array of professors at
Davidson.

“Davidson has an outstanding

student body,” Brown answered
when asked what attracted him to
Davidson. “You don’t find stu-
dents of this caliber at’ practically
any other school. [like smart people,
and it is an honor to work with the
students and with (fellow) profes-
sors.”

Brown brings many strengths

to Davidson, especially his consid-

erable business contacts. He will
attempt to “exercise and maximize”
these contacts as he highlights the
industrial application of chemistry
to his students.

For example, Brown and his
students were set to go to Mount
Holly today. “I want to show them
how organic chemistry is done,” he
explained. “I want to use my indus-
trial background to bring the real
world of chemistry to the class-
room.”

In his first week of teaching,
Brown feels the most difficult as-
pect of his work is adjusting to the
freedom and the responsibilities of
his new job.

“There’s a special challenge
that comes with teaching these ex-
tremely talented people,” he said.
“They are geographically diverse,
exceptionally bright, and they keep
me on my toes. I want to challenge
them and expose them to things
they haven’t seen before.” ,

After a year, Brown will know
if he will continue his teaching at
Davidson. For Brown, the reward
lies in, as he put it, “seeing students
succeed in what they want to do and
knowing that I had a role in it is
especially meaningful to me.

“I want to help students realize
their dreams.”

“Make Buster’s dreams come true!”

Griffith gets a

By JeEssicA GoQDSON

In response to complaints from neighbors and in a
general effort to improve the primary. entryway to
Davidson, the town board has committed to a two-
phase project to revamp eight acres of the Griffith

Street area, including the pond and hearby park. Town —

planner Tim Keane hopes that the renovations will
make this area more attractive to students, residents,
and visitors. :

The town was given $77,000 from the North
Carolina Parks and Recreation Trust Fund for renova-
tion of the park on the condition that the town match the
grant. In addition, Bruce Parker donated $50,000 for
the installation of a boardwalk alongside the pond in
phase one. The boardwalk will connect the sidewalks

make over

on Griffith street, bypassing the bridge that crosses
lanes of traffic. :

Currently silt is being removed from the pond to
uncover its natural bottom. Shallow waters, caused
problems in the past with an overgrowth of primrose, a
nuisance to locals who live near the pond.

Spillways will be added under Griffith Street to
promote drainage into pipes which have already been
laid. Sediment dams.are also under construction to

prevent future build-up of silt.

Project planner Leamon Brice estimates that phase
one will be completed by the end of October, when the
100-day contract is up.

Phase two will begin shortly after, with projects to
clear jogging trails in and around the park. A large
playground as well as additional landscaping is also on
the agenda.
