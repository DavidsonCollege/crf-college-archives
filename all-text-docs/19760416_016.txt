Spring term abroad: gone and trying to forget

“Greeks” dispatch greetings

By ROGER BROWN
Staff Writer

[Editor’s note: My cohort and some-
time co-author promised to send me a
column from Greece—here it is. It is
the product of a group effort, and
hopefully is the first of three.]

Greetings from the land where olive
oil flows like water and oaklava

replaces Grimm’s donuts, where -

goats graze and eleven Davidson
students relentlessly seek the truth
with the aid of their impeccable
shepherd, Dr. George Labban. The
purpose of this discourse is to
highlight the high adventure of the
group and help the rest of you
experience some of the excitement of
Greece.

The most effervescent member of
the group has been Jim “of the black
look’’ Brock. Jim has concocted a
scheme whereby the group could rake
in millions by converting the historic
site of Delphi, formerly the location of
the Oracle of Apollo, into a children’s
amusemént park. Milk chocolate
maenads, the Medusa ride, a monu-
mental statue of Athena with flashing
neon eyes (visible for miles), the
world’s largest roller coaster (say
what?) skirting the peaks of Mount
Parnassus are just some of the
features projected. Also, all temples
would be painted so that thev would
fluoresce under huge black lights
while everyone danced to the sounds
of“Achilles and his little Heels”’.

In addition to these ideas, Jim has
also received the nickname ‘‘Tundra’”’
as a result of icy nights in Youth
Hostels during which many were in
doubt as to Jim’s chances for sur-
vival.

Kay Jackson has achieved untarn-
ishable fame by doing the bump with
Dr. Labban on a bus from Sunion to
Athens. She has also displayed a
notable wardrobe of floral flannel
underwear and a poncho with huge
red, yellow, and blue polka dots on a
black background.

Vance Christopher claims fame as
the only group member to live
through a Turkish Bath. Young
Vance was scrubbed and massaged by
Turkey’s finest. «

Don Jackson’s ufiderwear flew off a
window sill in Athens on the fifth
floor and landed on a flagpole on the
second floor. Luckily Ed Wilkins

rescued the dangling drawers with a
suspended coat hanger after a brief
scare to Don. Ed has acquired the
title ‘‘Sacker of Hermes’’ following in
the path of Alciabides.

Staley Jordan traveled incognito to
Yugoslavia as Mrs. Weldon Jordan
and also received a combination
proposal-proposition on the overnight
boat ride to Crete.

Other epithets assigned in the
Homeric tradition include Dana Eng- .
lish, Leader of Men and Casual Ken
(Bell) of the Archaic Grin.

The choral group consisting of
everyone in the program has rendered
interpretations of almost every tune a
lead voice could corrupt, including
“Surfergirl’’, ‘‘Rag Doll’’, ‘‘Dance to
the Music’, and ‘‘Moon River’’. This
emotional release has aided the peace-

.ful coexistence and been a source of

unending joy to all listeners.

Other experiences worth mention
are showers by candlelight, mutila-
tion of our Rent-a-Car Peugot’s front
fender by a large truck which backed
right into us, and frisbee throwing at
the stadium of Delphi.

Greg Crawford, in his usual quest
for robust activity, strayed into a
seedy bar at 4:00 in the afternoon to
partake of some ambrosia and to
relax. Moments and a few drinks later
he was presented with a bill for $30;
Greg maintained his composure and
quietly excused himself from the bar
without harm to life or limb.

One of the most interesting features
of the Greek people themselves is
their advanced state of Women’s
Liberation. The women have been
freed from menial housework such as
ironing and washing and now have
time to chop wood and chase goats
while their spice (plural of spouse) are
busy drinking Ouzo, which is a putrid
blend of alcohol, licorice and low-

_ grade kerosine, and playing back-

gammon in the local bar.

All the group agrees that Davidson
should be appreciated for the follow-
ing: clean underwear, hot showers,
iced tea, basketball and softball
games, peanut butter, cowmilk, ket-
chup, McDonald’s believe it or not
music and dancing, mom, dad, toilet
seats, monkey paper, newspapers, the
“Tronic”? Columns of Chambers, the
P.O. and E.H. Little Library!
