Supreme Court clarifies N.C. student voter registration

- pre a4 SD tea > tts *: _ Voter

on for college stuc-—+-
in North Carolina may have
been cleared somewhat in a
state Supreme Court decision
last Monday. The court over-
turned an order by Wake Coun-
ty Superior Court that had
purged 2,000 UNC student
names from the Orange County
registration records and had
required Orange County elec- —
tion officials to administer
questionnaires regarding resi-
dency to students wishing to
register to vote.

The problem arose in Februa-
ry 1978 when a suit filed by the
Orange Committee, a consérva-
tive political action group from
northern Orange County, had
charged the Orange County
Board of Elections with allo-
wing students who were not
residents of the county to vote.

Some 6,500 Chapel Hill stu-
dents are’ registered to vote in
Orange County. Superior Court
Judge James H. Bailey then
handed down the order in
March, that the Supreme Court
recently reversed. The suit has
now returned to Superior Court
and is pending there. —

Previous critierion for stu-
dent voters was established in
1972 in the State Supreme
Court. ruling in the Hall Vs.
-Wake County Board of Elec-
tions case.

It stated that a student who
leaves his home to attend
college is not legally domiciled
in the place the college is
located. This, however, could be
rebutted. The new opinion is
broader in that it rules a

student can be comildarsd a.
. local residént if “he has aban-
doned has prior home, has a
of making the
college town his home and
intends to remain in the college
‘ town at least as long as he is a
student there or until he ac-
quires a new domicile.”
‘Making it easier for students
to register to vote might have

_ large implications. In David-

son, for example, approximate-
ly one-half of the town’s popula-
tion is students, enough to
effect the outcome of an elec-
tion. Even before the court’s
decision regarding Chapel Hill

U.C.-Berkeley sued over registration

BERKELY, CA _ (CPS)
—Heather Clendenin, a senior
here enrolled at Berkeley with
the intent of majoring in psy-
cho-biology. But when, four
years ago, she tried to take a
prerequisite introductory psy-
chology course, she couldn’t.
After trying three times, and
failing to get into the course,
she was at the end of her
sophomore year, and had to
declare her major. Unable to
take her chosen major, she had
to find an alternative.

Catherine Geraty had the
same problem with the same
psych class. Now she’s a senior
social welfare major.

The problem is common at
Berkeley, and now a group of
students and professors are
preparing to sue the university
in retaliation. Journalism pro-
fessor Joseph Lyford has called
for a class action suit against
the school because ‘‘students
feel cheated out of taking

students, few Davidson stu-

~ dents attempted to register and

vote‘in local elections. __

This, according to Mayor
Nancy McCormac, was not out
of any question concerning dis-
couragement by the town or
county officals. Any student
that felt Davidson was his home
and wanted the responsibility of
voting could have registered.

McCormac commented that
the town and the college had
always had reasonable commu-
nication and she saw the deci-
sion as one that would have
little effect on the community
itself.

classes they really want to
take.’’ As Lyford told the Daily
Californian, ‘‘The problem is
there’s not enough help. The
univerisity is taking money
under false pretenses.’’

The Student Information
Service estimates that ten per-
cent of all the class withdrawal
notices it processes ‘“‘list specifi-
cally the problem of not getting
into classes.”

The university, for the mo-
ment, is not concerned. ’’People
are threatening to sue us all the
time,’’ noted Roderick Park,
dean of the College of Letters
and Science. ‘‘That threat
comes at least once a week. . . If
students are able to get out of
here. . . and declare a major,
I’m not terribly concerned if
they’re delayed a quarter. I
think the financial cost of
making sure everybody can do

“everything would not be worth

the difficulty.”

John Stanfield

By LINDA HOOPES
Staff Writer
It's not easy making a living
playing music—many aspiring
guitar playing singers come and

go every year, but few can.

survive solely on their musical
earnings.

Not surprisingly, one of the
recent successes in the musical
field is a Davidson graduate.

John Stanfield, ’76, has been
playing guitar for quite a while.
He performed here at Davidson
as a student, and was so

popular here that. he was asked '

to play at other campuses and
even at some small clubs in
Charlotte.

The story of how he did it is,
as C. Shaw Smith describes it,
one of “talent, determination,
and willingness.” After gradua-
tion, Stanfield, at his own
expense, printed a small bro-
chure introducing himself and
sent copies to club owners and
other prospective employers up
and down the coast.

He then called or wrote all
who answered him, saying he'd
be in the area und could he stop

by for a minute. Once he got .

there, he asked for a chance to
play. “You don’t have to hire
mey’’ he would say, “just give
me five minutes.’”

More often than not, ac-
cording to Smith, he was hired.
He has played the East Coast

intelligence,
talent, and determination have
brought him success.

John Stanfield's

from New England to Florida,
often being asked to play return
engagements (the sure sign of a
good musician). : S

He has an album out, with
the prospect of another soon.

He will be playing his
12-string and 6-string guitars,
along with a few other instru-
ments in the 900 Room this
weekend. There will be two
performances on Friday, and
two on Perey: Don’t miss
him!
