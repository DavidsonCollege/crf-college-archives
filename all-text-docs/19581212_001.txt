a night of fun and merry-making for a group of children .

This annual event is again be-

Academic Rating
Attracts Freshmen

The results of a poll tak-

have been released by Dean
White. In questionnaires
handed out to freshmen,
they stated their motives
for choosing Davidson.

Of 240 questionnaires filled
out, 219 indicated academic
rating was a reason. Second in

All is not right at the Snack Bar.

The “waste land” pictured above is far short of
, being either especially sanitary or conducive to the en-
jJoyment of Snack Bar food.

During rush hours, as pictured above, coffee‘ cups,
spilled cokes, bits of doughnuts, cheese crackers, and
the like sometimes remain on the tables for an hour or
more.

Many times we have had the unpleasant experience
lof having to clear away the debris in order to make an
area large enough for our coffee cup.

There is no excuse for this kind of situation.

Students Direct: Gift Fund To
Aid Negro Seminary Students

IFC Presents Annual |

Starting

Date For Annual Drive

Davidson students today voted to direct the efforts

of the 1958-59 YMCA Gift Fund drive towards the pro-
ject presented in Tuesday’s chapel by the Rev. Lawrence

Bottoms.

Bottoms, the secretary of the
Department of Negro Work,
Board of Christian Education, of
the Presbyterian Church, U. S.,
urged the students to establish
a fund to make available aid to
Negro youths planning for the
ministry, and further, to help

‘staff new Negro churches in

the South. He spoke of the de-
sire of Negtocs for more en-
lightened exoosition of the Gos-
pel.

The other two proposed
projects for the Git Fund

‘matter how hard they work, the size of their tasks pro-
hibits the completion of all three. The tables seem to
be the most easily ignored of the three, so we scrape
away our own junk.

The DAVIDSONIAN would like to suggest that .the
Snack Bar hire at least one and possibly two more bus
-boys to keep the tables clean, especially during the eve-
[ming rush hours.

Many students have complained, and we think just-
| ly, that the service on short orders is slow, and that at
| times the wait is not altogether justified by the product.

Further, during chanel hour and-in the evenings be-
tween ten and eleven-thirty there. are far too few at-
,tendants behind the bar to serve the masses which grab
for nickel cokes or, after a while, ... . anything edibic.

We would therefore suggest that the management
study the situation and arrange to hire as many com-
petent additional attendants as necessary to offer good
service.’

The total picture could be brightened considerably
by a strictér supervision of the entire operation to insure
that the best service practical was being offered at all

thought that each speaker

he could discuss the particular

To limit the large financial

the YMCA plans to sell the
books to be discussed with a

Bar-Ilan Impresses

Ralph Wilson, president of
the Intramural Athletic Coun-
cil, explained the purpose and
aims of this new organization in
an interview with DAVIDSON-

LIAN reporters this week.

What is the purpose of the
IMAC?

“Its purpose is to improve

Golden Returns To

Harry Golden, editor of the
“Carolina Israelite’ and noted
author of the best selling book,
“Only in America,” will visit
the Davidson campus sometime
in January or early Februa
He will discuss the topic, Ur-
banization and Industrialization

eance Behind this Development.

The College Union discussion

dent, has visited the campus

here at Davidson, to revise it sential for most people and the
where needed, make it more ef- original spirit. of intramurals is

ficient, give fraternities cqual
representation. and have stu-
dent contro! over it.”

How is the IMAC working
fo carry out this purpose?

“We have a representative
from each fraternity, the inde-
pendents, and two representa-
tives from the athletic depart-
ment. All are working to co-or-
dinate the intramural program
and increase its efficiency
through a co-operative effort of
students and athletic faculty.”

How was the IMAC organ-
ized?

“Coach Heath Whittle has
been the one-man co-ordinator
f intramurals in past years. At
the first of this year he insti-
gated the formation of the
Council on a trial basis. Repre-
sentatives were selected by the
fraternities and the Indepen-
dents. These thirteen elected
Coaches Whittle and Hunt to be
the two faculty Councilmen.”

Of what importance is the

IMAC to the Davidson Stu-
dent?

“Athletic participation is es-

for those students who don't
participate in varsity sports
either for the lack of ability or
time. On our campus, the most
convenient outlet for these stu-
dents is through the fraternity
system. Notices to inform the
Independents are posted at Mrs.
Copeland’s and at the Union.”

Are Davidson students tak-
ing advantage of the IMAC
program?

“Oh, yes! All you have to do
is go down to any of the intra-
mural games. One barrier, how-
ever, to full student participa-
tion is how far.to restrict the
varsity athlete. The council is
still toying with this.”

Who are the officers and
members of the IMAC?

“I, representing ATO, am
president; Joe Milner, Sigma
Chi, is vice-president, and
George Ramsey of the Phi Delts
is secretary. Other members are
Bill Terrell, Independents; For-
rest Wilkinson, KA; Billy Da-
vis, Beta; Ed Hall, Sig Ep; Wal-
ler Taylor, Phi Gam; Sherrill

Campus With Artistry

By PERRIN WRIGHT
Davidsonian Music Critic
David Bar-Ilan, undoubtedly the best pianist that
Davidson has heard in a number of years, was presented
last Friday night in an Artist Series concert in Chambers
Auditorium. Bar-Illan is a native of Israel, who has come
to be recognized in Atherica as a very talented and
rounded pianist, although some facets of his art seem

better rounded than others.

In general, his playing indi-
cated a high degree of artistry
and taste, which few enough
people ever obtain. He proved
himself realistic at any rate by
securing his own piano for the
concert, which saved him the
embarrassment of having to re-
tune after cach number.

His program was Chopin-
heavy in spirit as well as in
number, with the exception of
the opening “Gavotte and Vari-
ations” by Rameau, which were |
played well and then gone for-
ever. An early Beethoven sona-
ta, and a scherzo and barcarolle
by Chopin completed the first
half.

The second part began with
a suite by Robert Starer; it is
a modern composition inspired
by Israeli folk music. During
the performance of this number
the balcony group, a reliable
gauge of student interest, no-
ticeably thinned out. This was
a reluctance to believe, rather
than an overt display of anti-
Semitism; the piece is easily
interesting, and probably endur-
ing as long as Bar-Ilan is con-
certizing. The program ended
with a Schumann sonata, and
a few encores, mostly Chopin.
