Learning Resource Center Provides Study Tips for Students

By Alice Felmlee

In the fall of 1992 Davidson
faculty members designed a new
program aimed at helping students
in all areas of academic life. The
Learning Resource Center headed
by Barbara Hess offers Monday
night workshops lead by profes-
sors and other faculty members
ranging from “Increasing Your
Power of Concentration” to “Tips
for Writing a Better Paper.”

Former SGA President, An-

tong Foxx, had the original idea
for the program and teamed with
John Eaves of the Dean of Stu-
dents’ Office in presenting his idea
to the rest of the faculty.

Because of many professors’
support for the program, Dean
Eaves was able to obtain funding
to start the program from the Of-
fice of the Vice President for Aca-
demic Affairs.

Barbara Hess, who was se-
lected to spear head the effort, be-

Georgia Students React

to Lull in Flag Battle
ATLANTA (CPS) - Even though
Georgia Gov. Zell Miller recently
abandoned the fight to remove a
Confederate symbol from the state
flag, some students say the battle
has just begun.

The governor, who withdrew
his proposal in early March, was
unable to garner enough support
from the Legislature to alter the
flag, said the governor’s deputy
press secretary Peggy Moody.

The battle has raged since
May, when the governor at-
tempted to introduce legislation
to have the Confederate stars and
bars, which were added in 1956,
removed from the flag before At-
lanta hosts the 1994 Super Bowl

and the 1996 Olympics.
The skirmish, however,

shows no signs of ending, and
officials predict a state referen-
dum next year to resolve the mat-
ter.

Some objected to the
governor’s plan, saying that ban-
ning the battle symbol is not
enough, and they want to go back
to the original 1799 Georgia flag
design, or to have an entirely new
one designed.

Hundreds of college students
marched, protested, and at one
point, burned the flag in demon-
strations throughout Atlanta.

“People don’ trealize the pre-
1956 flag is an adaptation of the
Confederate national flag. Why
go from the Confederate battle
flag to the Confederate national

‘about .

flag? It’s six of one, half dozen of
another,” said Lawrence Philpott,
a junior at Georgia State Univer-
sity and a member of Descen-
dants of Enslaved Africans.

Philpott described himself as
a“majorinstigator” in February’s
flag burning incident. “We did
not burn it to be radical. We
burned it to show how fed up we
were. We didn’t want the march
to be just another watered-down
march,” Philpott said.

Philpott saida growing num-
ber of students are becoming in-
volved in the flag controversy,
and next year will encourage even
more demonstrations.

Group Sponsors Anxiety Month
MAPLEWOOD,NJ (CPS)- Asif
you didn’t have enough to worry

The National Anxiety Cen-
ter has declared April to be Na-
tional Anxiety Month and has an-
nounced the winners of its third
annual “Chicken Little Awards”
taken from media reports.

Killer meteors, a $40 billion
space station, and margarine were
among those named. “If tried to
dream this stuff up, I.couldn’t,”
said Alan Caruba, founder of the
tongue-in-cheek contest,

Winners included areport on
an asteroid that was reported to
have been a “close call” when it
was 2.2 million miles away from
Earth, and a study that concluded
margarine may be worse for
people than butter.

‘gan by organizing a small network
of professors and faculty members
who were interested in leading a
Monday night workshop on a skill
with which they felt students might
need tips for improvement.

Dean Eaves, who has been
monitoring the program since its
origins last fall commented, “It’s
wonderful to see the faculty in-
volvement.

"Those who volunteered have
been very enthusiastic, energetic,
and available thus showing their
willingness to help the students.”

The Learning Resource Cen-
ter began the new year witha work-
shop on February 8 led by faculty
members Nantz and Longworth

entitled “Time Management."

Later workshops included “How
to Read a Textbook”, “Improving
‘Your Memory”, “Choosing and
Researching a Topic”, and “Writ-
ing a Better Paper” led by Drs.

Thornberry, Staton,
Serebrennikov, and Holland, re-
spectively.

Tonight in Chambers room
235 at 7 p.m. the Learning Re-
source Center is holding a work-
shop designed to instruct students
in “Stress Management.” Monday
night workshops coming up in-
clude “Strategies for Test Taking”
on April 12.

The Learing Resource Cen-
ter program, which has received

wonderful reviews from both stu-
dents and faculty, is meant to be “a
supplementary program for any
students, A or marginal, who want
to improve upon the skills they
have,” said Dean Eaves.

~  “Ttisa givenhere that students
are brightand intelligent butnotall
have the good study skills needed
to improve,” he added.

Looking to the future, it is
hoped that the Learning Resource
Center will become a more perma-
nent type resource on the Davidson

_ campus.

According to Dean Eaves,
“We hope students will learn to
consider it as an option when they
need academic relief.”
