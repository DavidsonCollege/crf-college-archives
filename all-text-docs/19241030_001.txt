John 15:15: “Henceforth | call you not
servants but friends,” was the text.
“Next to the relation of a Saviour, the

relation of friendship to Christ is the great-

est thing to me,” said the speaker in hegin-

ning. “Friends are the greatest things in the
world. Friends give color and vividness to
life.

“It is not so much the buildings, not. the
grounds, nor the faculty that makes college
a power in a man’s life as it is the friends-

who goes through college without forming
at least one true friendship, the friends hip

say, “Soul, I am thine,’ and who can look

Because of those friend-
and their influence on us,
Our mothers, fathers, sweethearts, and other
friends give us aspirations the
nobler things in life.

“We are constantly reaching up tor friend-
ship. Yet we have not found a friend so
sympathetic that he can be in full sympathy

The vital essence of Christianity is friend-
ship with Jesus; to miss this friends ship
means missing the biggest thing in life. This
friendship with Christ is entered into just as
any other friendship, by our own free will.
We give ourselves into His hands, and take
Him as our Saviour.

“Why ought we love Jesus? Why ought
we love anyone? We love Him for what
He is, for what He does for us, and for
what we can do for Him,

“What He? What Wwe want in
anyone to a friend?~ First, we want
truth. We can't love someone we can't trust.
Jesus before the Sanhedrin signed His own
death warrant by speaking the truth.

“We want a brave man. To win the
love of a man, one must be brave. Not only
physical but moral bravery are manifest in
Him. He was brave enough to stand out!
against the crowd. Jesus entering Jerusalem
with the shadow of the cross over the city
Was a great example of bravery.

“We want a noble, a holy man. ‘Men are
wistful for holiness.’ The focussed eyes of
two thousarrd: years have been unable to de-
tect a flaw in His character.

“Again, we want a friend who loves.
