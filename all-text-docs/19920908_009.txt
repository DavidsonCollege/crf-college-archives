to your doorstep only because unlike the
students and teachers here at Davidson
College, most people get Labor Day off so
the printers were closed. Enjoy!!

resolved for now. After many ar-
ticles in the paper, forums, de-
bates, and hours before the Student
Conduct Council, the only change
made was to enlarge the Council

from eighteen members to thirty in

order to include more students and
to contribute to the new Judiciary

| Committee, designed to hear ad-

mitted Code of Responsibility
cases.

Still, the mystique of the Coun-
cil remains, hence the purpose of
this, the first in a series of articles.
It is my hope that you will read
carefully each of these installa-
tions about the system. The mem-
bers of the Honor Council, do not
want to be feared or resented; and
there is no reason why any student
should be in the dark about the
system.

Weareall working together to
make this system operate. It is
ours; and the Honor Council mem-
bers want to make you, the active
participants, fecl familiar with all
its workings. It is therefore my
hope that you ‘will grow in your
comfort with and understanding of
the Honor System. These columns
represent an effort to make the
system more accessible to you.

Let me first introduce to you
the members of the Honor Council
by class. These are your class
representatives, chosen by you as
some of the most qualified and

respected sindénts from among
those nominated.

Seniors - Rachel Epps .

Kathy Hetherington
Becky Hunter
Erin Lee
Laura Malenas
Alan Verm
David Wang
Juniors - Peter Amidon
Will Canu
Ward Davis
Molly Sentell
Sally Stone
Sophs - Arthur Gaston
John Philpott
Cascy Rogers

Obviously, there are no fresh-
man represcniatives, for the simple
reason that members of that class
need time to grow into the commu-
nity, find their respective niches,
and get to know each other. Votes
for their representatives can then
be founded in a year of expericnce
knowing their peers.

If you don’t know these
people, make an effort to meet
them. If you have any questions
about the Honor System, please
ask them; they are eager tohcighten
everyone’s awareness of and com-
fort with the Honor System.

THE DAVIDSONIAN v OPINIONS TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 1992 9

The Secretary of the Honor
Conancil is Catherine Milligan (a
Senior), and I (Matt Bumstead, if
you haven’t picked that up yet) am
the Chairman. We are the two
executive officers of the Council
and the two members most in-
volved with the intricacies of the °
process. Please remember that we ~
are always eager to hcar questions,
comments, complaints, and cer-
tainly compliments about the sys-
tem.

As I close this introductory
column, I urge you to continue
reading these installments for the
next few wecks. I will do my best
to explain the system in detail. In
addition, I ask that you take it upon
yourselves to Icarn by performing ~
one simple action: READ the
Code. Don’t just read the sanc-
tions or the Code of Responsibil-
ity. Read the wholc blamed thing.
It will only take twenty or so min-
utcs and will answer many of your
questions up front: Whether you
have already read it, never have, or
always say you have, please read
it. Until next week, I thank you for
your interest and welcome your
comments.
