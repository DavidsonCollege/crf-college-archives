The Visit And The Secret

Another installment in the recent
history of Davidson will be made next
week with arrival of campus of an
evaluation committee of the Southern
Association of Colleges and Schools.

The sojourn of the seven-man dele-
gation here will be the climax of near-
ly two years of work on the part of
Davidson leaders to compile a self-
evaluation report in connection with
the visit of the Southern Association
committee.

Doubtless no aspect of the college
will be left unexamined by the group
during its three-day stay.

Davidson is in no danger of losing
its accreditation, we feel sure, and
may indeed enhance its position of
leadership among institutions of learn-
ing in the South.

The self-study report itself is no
brief statement. In printed form it is
thicker than the college catalogue,
and it is necessarily more realistic
than the usual college propaganda.

ss * &

One matter which is not contained
in the self-study report and which may
well rate a great deal of concern on
the part of the visiting committee is
the measure which would prevent as-
sistant professors and instructors from
voting in faculty meetings on matters
of college policy.

Such a proposal was approved on
first reading by the Trustees last
month, but the measure must pass a
second reading by the Trustees before
it becomes official.

What is striking is the air of secrecy
which surrounded the matter. While
full details of other action were avail-
able after the meeting of the Trus-
tees last month, no announcement or
hint of such an important item as
limiting a professor’s vote in faculty
meetings was even mentioned.

When asked by THE DAVIDSON-
IAN why such a change might be con-
sidered. President D. Grier Martin ex-
pressed the feeling that changes in
college policy should be approved by
members of the faculty who had been
at Davidson more than just a few
years.

_ The president would give no rea-
son as to why the action was not an-
‘nounced along with other details of
the Trustees’ meeting.

If the purpose in the proposed
amendment is to set qualifications for
voting on the basis of time served at
Davidson, as President Martin implied,
then the absurdity of the proposal is
plainly evident.

With the current faculty here, an
associate professor who has been
teaching for two months may vote,
while another professor who has been
at Davidson for nearly ten years would
be disqualified.

How the Trustees could endorse
such a situation is beyond us; yet,
were the change in effect now, such
would be the situation.

The ambiquity of the term “college
policy” is also dangerous. President
Martin declined to distinguish between
policy and non-policy matters, but in-
dicated that several of the most re-
cent cases of student conduct could
be considered matters of “college pol-
icy.”

In other words, nearly every mat-
ter considered by the faculty could
conceivably be classified as one of

policy.

All of the facts and implications of
this matter are obviously yet to be de-
termined.

From what we have been able to
gather, faculty feeling—both among
those who would be disenfranchised
and those who would not—is running
rather high. Unfortunately, this reac-
tion is based somewhat on rumors,
since as of late yesterday afternoon,
the faculty still had not been officially
notified of the actual proposal.

We trust that this incomprehensible
air of furtiveness will be dispelled
~soon, and that there will be extensive
and open discussion among al] con-
cerned ‘before such a drastic move be
implemented.

Full and honest communication -

now, especially between faculty and
Trustees, will partially compensate for
its incredible absence to date.

‘Green Grow The Lilacs’
Merits Critic's Applause

By MIKE HARRINGTON
Davidsonten Associate Editor

“Green Grow the Lilacs,” is good light entertainment, well worth the seeing

despite problems in the singing and wi

This play with music by Lynn
Riggs was later adapted into
the Broadway movie hit, ‘Okla-
homa,”’ and is the first produc-
tion of the season for the David-
son Drama Department. Accord-
ing to the author this play's
moods attempt to reflect themes
and characters seen in an Okla-
homa childhood. The sets are
well-placed and their realism
add much to the play.

There is a romance between
a beautiful farm girl (Barbara
Fagg) and a cocky cowboy
(John Warren), an earthy old
aunt (Mrs. Cary Wolf), a bad
guy (Don Davis), and a number
of other characters from a farm
ranch environment.

The love protagonists are sim-
ply drawn and adequately por-
trayed. Warren and Miss Fagg
doing a fair job of acting out
a romance between an almost
naive farm girl and a boisterous
good guy.

Of the four major roles that
of the villain Jeeter Fry, played
by Don Davis, is the best por-

trayed. Davis makes very few
flaws in his Interpretation of a
warped little character who
Nonetheless attracts a strange
sympathy as the play unwinds.
John Bailey gives a very good
performance in one of the minor
roles as Old Man Peck.

The weakest point of the play
is the singing. Warren does not
have a full enough voice to car-
ry the songs and lyrical moods
his role demands; his singing is
strained and this detracts from
his cocky, happy-go-lucky atti-
tude which is otherwise well-
done.

Laurey’s song is done a lit-
tle better than most and the

other songs are at best adequate,.

except for one by Patsy Whitley
as Ado Annie, whose style is
marvelously suited for her role
as a scatterbrained Oklahoma
farm girl. Her song is quite ef-
fective, the square dance scene
comes off rather well.

This simple little play flows
like an “old song” and is kinda
melodramatic at points, but

some of the group scenes.

there are suggestions of unrest
and more subtle implications
throughout—many of the hidden
meanings are dependent upon

the actions of the cast and are

often lost in the shuffle.

These questions come imme-
diately to mind as the play un.
folds: What hints about human
nature is the playwright trying
to put across when he makes
the villain Jeeter Fry an object
of sympathy, particularly as
Curley goads Jeeter into several
acts of desperation? Why should
Curley and Laurey be almost
comical in characterization as
opposed to Jeeter as a more
complex human tragedy? Why
is Laurey so attracted to and
yet repelled by Jeeter and where
is this shown?

So “Green Grow the Lilacs” is
simple and yet not so simple.
But either way Director Rupert
T. Barber has gotten a good
performance out of a freshman-
studded cast that reflects not so
much their inexperience as their
enthusiasm.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Mixon Renews Campaign
For Honor Court Change

Dear Editor:

The present Honor System,
specifically Section ‘5, Article
VII of the Student-Body Con-
stitution, is a dangerously ex-
cessive and outmoded punish.
ment system.

PUNISHMENT

The designated punishment is
excessive. and should be mod-
erated. The inestimable dam-
age inflicted upon a_ student
found guilty‘ of a violation is not
in proportion to what in fact
has been committed.

Is there anything that a stu-
dent can do to the’ College com-
munity or student body, that ap-
proaches the magnitude of the
punishment awarded to a guilty
offender?

One does not join the Honor

System on a voluntary basis:
it is compulsory to abide by
the regulations and submit to
the punishment if guilty of vio-
lation. A social group of our
college size requires a certain
degree of coercion and sanc-
tion to produce the measure of
solidarity and unity requisite
for its maintenance.

The Honor System serves an
important function in this re-
spect: however, it is the desig-
nated sanction of dismissal that
is dangerously excessive,

FINALITY

There is a certain degree of
finality in the dismissal of a
student from college. The pres-
ent procedure for appeal {fs un-
defined and often changed. and
even then it certainly appears to
be futile.

Absolute punishment demands
fool-proof and perfect methods
of determining guilt, in order
to offset the irrevocable na-
ture of absolute or final pun-
ishments and assure infallibil-
ity. The dismissal penalty is
absolute in its implications, and
is determined by one’s own fel-
low students, who are indeed
fallible.

The questionable methods of
collecting evidence (e.g. bait-
ing), the student politics and
friendships involved (e.g. in the
selection and investigation of
suspects), are factors which en-
ter into any Honor Court de-
cision.

Such relative and partial fac-
tors will always be present, and
therefore. the penalties should
reflect these inadequacies of the
Court. It is not sufficient that
Court members try to be objec-
tive: the Honor Court cannot af-
ford to be wrong. yet they could
e.

MERCY

The present Honor System
needs an enlarged concept of
justice that takes into account
the role of mercy, The role of
mercy is to season and temper
justice with genuine humanity,
and approach the God-like at-
tribute of forgiveness: mercy is
also needed in order to account
for the possible fallibility of the
suspect as well as the Court
judges, and the extenuating
causes and circumstances relat-
ed to the violation.

Does an educational institu-
tion owe its students more than
a rigidly enforced “tradition of
honor’? Presently, if the Honor

Court finds a student guilty of
violation, it mechanically entails
immediate dismissal. Punish-
ment, properly understood in-
volves both its deterrent and
reformatory aspects.

The present Honor System
needs a strong emphasis on the
reformatory aspects of punish.
ment. Who could do more for
the individual violator of our
“community of honor.”’ a large
and unconcerned society or our
common community?

A college community is finan-
cially capable and morally re-
sponsible for administering cor-
rective therapy for the malad-
justment of any student to the
regulations of an Honor Sys-
tem.

A college administration that
takes pride in the careful selec-
fon of students should not be
co quick to support their dis-
missal. when such well-chosen
students fail to adjust to a rigid-
ly enforced Honor System.

PETITION

These oviections to the pres-
ent Honor System are serious
and present some of the grave
consequences that can affect the

‘seeuritv of an individual stu-

dent. I urge other students to
netition that Section 5. Article
VII of the Student Body Consti-
tution be amended to contain
the substance of these following
suggestions:

1) to retain dismissal from
the college only as a maximum
penalty for the violation of the
provisions of the Honor Code:

(2) to initiate as an alterna-
tive, reformatory and corrective
treatment of students found guil-
ty of violation of the Honor
Code, that the treatment be paid
for by the college, and that the
treatment be available by either
the guilty student's request OR
the opinion of the Court mem-
bers;

(3) with repeated violations,
it should be at the discretion
of the Court to show cause that
continued corrective treatment
will not yield a reformed and
well-adjusted student, and hence
dismissal is appropriate and
proper.

RESULT

These modifications would al-
ter our present Honor System,
but the sense of honor of the
well-adjusted individual student
is not jeopardized or impaired
by the possibility of reforma-
tory measures for those students
who fall to properly adjust.

The dangers inherent in the
current provision for only im-
mediate dismissal if found gull-
tv, these are greater than the
dangers of permitting a viola-
tor to be given opportunity for
reform in our own common com-
munity. You owe it to yurself.
You are infallible.

Dear Editor:

MACHAVELLI: I have heard
from a reliable source that there
is at least one place on earth
where my maxim “the end justi-
fies the means” has taken root:

and, of all places, it is at a
Christian liberal arts college.

CESARE BORGIA: Really,
Nicolo, where is it and how is
your theory applied?

MACHIAVELLI: There is a
small college in North Carolina,
Davidson I believe it is called,
on that new continent which our
fellow . countryman Columbus
discovered.

At this institution, the admin-
istration believing that the ROTC
department should be maintain-
ed on the campus, requires
every student to take two years
of the course since it fears that
the department would not be
able to be maintained on the
campus if everyone were not
required to take the basic
course.

CESARE BORGIA: I don’t ex-
actly see what you mean, Nic-
colo.

MACHIAVELLI: Well, if less
than 100 students signed up for
the course during their fresh-
men year, the entire depart-
ment would have to be abol-
ished.

Therefore, the college sacri-
fices the interests of approxi-
mately half of every class which

enters the college, that is, those .

who do not take the advanced
program, in order to maintain
that same program. Don’t you
see, the end (the maintenance
of the department) justifies the
means (wasting two years of
many students’ time).

CESARE BORGIA: Yes, in-
deed, Nicoolo, it is very clear
now. Your ideas have been very
‘skillfully applied. I am also sur.
prised, however, that your
theory, since it is considered by
so many people to be immoral,
has taken root at a Christian in-
stitution.

CLOSE - UP

By TOM CRAIG
Davidsonian Associate Editor

ON RUSH

It is evident, as Rush enters its third week, that
a great deal of misinformation is being accepted as
fact by Davidsonians on both sides of the fraternity
— independent line. As I have viewed both these
areas of campus life from within and from without,
I feel that there are certain clarifications I must
make — particularly for this year’s freshmen.

SOME ISSUES

Charge: Fraternities are anti-intellectual.

Reply: Hogwash. On the Davidson level, if any-
thing, fraternities stimulate scholarship. The C to C-
plus requirements for attaining brotherhood, the in-
tense competition for the Belk Scholarship Trophy,
the fact that a majority of the seniors recently select-
ed for Phi Beta Kappa are fraternity men all bear
this out. Again on the Davidson level, fraternities do
not require a member’s time to the extent that his
work suffers.

Charge: Fraternities are expensive.

Answer: Yes, one can say that fraternity mem-
bership is MORE expensive than the life of an Inde-
pendent. Some inactive fraternity members have re-
corded savings of $100 to $300 a year by purchasing
food on a per-meal basis, by avoiding the College’s
$46 fraternity housing fee, and by avoiding pay-
ment of national fraternity dues and local assess-
ments.

One thing to keep in mind: when a fraternity
has a party, EVERYBODY pays for it. It makes no
difference if you are unable to attend; it matters
not if you voted against having the party in the first
place.

Charge: Fraternities are cliquish.

Answer: Isn’t that the way of all men? I am
certain that disappearance of fraternities from the
Davidson scene would NOT keep groups of similar
people from sticking together. However, a common
complaint by freshmen about Rush is that the fra-
ternity, along with choosing them, is also selecting
their associates for the next four years in the form
of pledge brothers. As a pledge, you are expected to
associate primarily with these people.

Charge: Fraternities are undemocratic.

Reply: Yes, indeed. The fraternity, the country
club, and the Rotary Club all operate on much the
same principle. Even with removal of color and creed
bars, the fraternity will remain just as exclusive so
long as it operates on a blackball system.

The question, “Should the fraternities have a
responsibility to ALL the freshmen?” is often posed
in the Davidson framework, where the percentage
of students in fraternities, and the social advantages
of fraternity membership, are great.

A BRIEF SURVEY

ett Statement: The food at a fraternty house is
etter.

Reply: Emphatically yes. It is obvious that a
cook can better prepare for 50 than 400.

a Statement: here is no social life for Indepen-
ents,

Reply: This was true until this year. The Social
Council has largely rectified this situation.

Statement: There is no alternative to fraternities
at Davidson.

Opinion: I think that there is. Even with its
concomitant problems, I think experimentation
should continue. IF fraternities are to be kept, then
I suggest a serious study into the benefits of national
ties. I urge consideration of universal bidding.

If fraternities per se are to go, it must be in a
movement that is student-led. If they are to go, then
I suggest that some viable eating club arrangement
be proposed — to be tried within the framework of
our current de-centralized eating facilities.

IN CLOSING...

_Freshmen, you judge. If you pledge a fraternity,
realize not only that it is not the evil world that may
have been described to you by an Independent, but
also that it is not the glowing wondrous existence
some fraternity men paint. .

If you decide not to pledge, then begin work to
ameliorate certain disadvantages of the Indeper:

Sophomores Ask Change
In Punishment Procedure

Dear Editor:

The unconcern for personal in-
tegrity which the Honor Court
follows in its enforcement of
justice merits criticism. With
its emphasis on rigid and unre-
lenting punishment, the Court
disregards the total well-being
of those who are brought before
it. We propose, therefore, that
the Honor Court be allowed con-
stitutionally to use discretion in
dealing with the offenders.

As long as the Honor Court
must expel every student con-
victed of cheating, stealing, or
lying (as the Constitution states),
it ignores the fact of human
frailty. In order to better serve
Davidson College, then, punish-
ments should be in accordance
with the severity of the of-
fense,

A distinction should be made,
in cases of theft, between a mis-
deameanor and a felony: and
in cases of cheating, the dif-
ference between intentional and

unintentional acts should be ob-
served. Lying under oath, should
still be punished by expulsion.

The distinction should be made
because some offenders may not
threaten the community enough
to be expelled. For example,
a student may unintentionally
plagiarize by failing to acknow)-
edge his source, an offense for
which dismissal is not war-
ranted.

We further recommend:

(1) That members of the Court
serve a single term of one year
and

(2) That no student should
be threatened with expulsion for
failure to press charges against
another.

The purpose of the Honor
Court is to preserve the order
of the academic community.
When that order is threatened,
the Court should act; when St is
not dangerously challenged, the
Court should use discretion.

wise stated.)
