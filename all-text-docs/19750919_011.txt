For over 130 years we've been using

the wor “quality” 1 in our advertising.

Once again, we'd like to tell you what
we mean by it. Ss

¢ Our brewent i 1844. a

Blue Ribbon quality means the best tasting beer you can,
get. A quality achieved only by using the finest ingredients
and by adhering to the most rigid of brewing standards.

In Milwaukee, the beer capital of the world, Pabst Blue
Ribbon continues to be the overwhelming best seller .
year after year. Blue Ribbon outsells its nearest
competitor nearly five to one. That’s why we feel

we’ve earned the right to challenge any beer.

So here’s the Pabst challenge: Taste and compare
the flavor of Blue Ribbon with the beer you’re
drinking and learn what Pabst quality in beer

is all about. But don’t take our word for it.

Taste our word for it.

Pabst. Since 1844.
The quality has always
come through.
