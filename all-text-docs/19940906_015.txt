The following is an excerpt
from an article by Matthew
Covington from the March 15,
1974 issue of the Davidsonian. It
tells of the life of an extraordinary
man, FrancisWilson Price, the
founder of the Davidsonian, who
died in January of the same year.

Ithas been 60 years now.since
that good ship, THE DAVIDSO-
NIAN, amid gloomy predictions

as to her final ruin, and enthusias-
tic wishes for a safe and prosper-
ous voyage, was first launched on
the troubled seas of college life.
It has been 60 years too, since
the Conklin self-filling fountain
pen and Crash Suits. It has been 60
years since the night of March 18,
1914 when the Davidson Student
Body voted for the establishment
of a weekly newspaper, to be ed-
ited by the Junior class member

Francis Wilson Price, our fou

who conceived of the idea, Frank
Wilson Price.

Price’s death on Jan. 12, at the
age of 78 was not a shock. He had
been ill for many years with
Parkinsin’s disease. His death was
instead somewhat of a tragedy.

This is nota story on his death,
that story has been documented in
many papers and in many coun-
tries. It is, instead, a story of his
life which touched many in this
