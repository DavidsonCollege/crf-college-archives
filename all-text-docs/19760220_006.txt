Meunch views bright baseball year

cated that the outlook for this
year’s Wildcat baseball team
is bright.

“If the caliber of baseball on
the East coast is the same as it

is on the West coast (where
Meunch coached last year),
then we should have a good
club.”

The Wildcats will definitely

have some gaps to fill if they
are going to match last year’s
21-14 team which graduated
All-Southern Conference play-
ers George Weicker and Mark
Rodgeman along with short--

stop Gary Pomeroy. Meunch
hopes that this year’s strong
pitching staff will be able to
counter-balance the loss of
strong hitters like Weicker,
Rodgeman and Pomeroy.

“Our pitching is definitely
our strength. We have ten
people, any of whom we can
use. Joel Tew, Tim Barr,
Mike Hall, Tim Peck, Tim
Purcell and Alin Alig are all
veterans.

In addition, we have four
freshmen—Ron Cannon, John
Madden, Mike Linz and Ken
Norwood—who have looked
good so far,’’ Meunch
continued.

He plans to rely upon the
Cats’ outfield. “Ed Willing-
ham, Mitch Stone, and Stan
Brown are strong both offen-
sively and _ defensively,’’

Davidson ruggers shut out Wolfpack

rugby season would be a
bright one for Davidson.

State was never really in the
game, as the Davidson scrum
came out mob tackling the
State backs. Constant pres-

‘sure forced bad passing and

numerous fumbles.

Davidson backs ran through
the State defense for a total of
six tries. Mark Connors broke
loose for several long runs, one
for a score. Wilburn Swain
also scored once on a run.
Mike Stick ran 50 yards
through the State defense for
another try. In action Stick
continually screamed, ‘‘Kill
Babbitts! Hurt him!,’’ refer-
ring to State’s highly unpop-
ular player coach, who played
in the North Carolina scrum.

Chip Crawford, Victor Mc-
Millan, and Frank Hamilton
rounded out the scoring with
Jeff Heslop adding the two
point afterkicks.

Although a practice match,

State was an important vic-
tory

“Hopefully, Saturday’s
game will set the pace for the
spring season, which begins in
full after the break. I thought
our overall timing was? super-
ior, and with the speed avail-
able in the backfield, I think
Davidson will be able to
outrun everyone,” said rugger
Carlton Cooke.

“T believe the team realized

its full potential Saturday,” he
said.

Meunch said. ‘‘We’ll have to
rely on them to do a lot of our
hitting.”

According to assistant
coach George Weicker, if there
is any weakness that the team
will have, it is the lack of a
home run hitter. ‘‘We will not
be a homerun ball club. We
will probably hit half of last
year’s total of 17. However,
these guys will make up for it
with their speed and base
stealing.”

The role that freshmen will
play will not be nearly as
substantial as it was with this
year’s football and basketball
teams, but at least two and
possibly three freshmen will
have starting positions when
the season opens.

“They have beaten out
upperclassmen, not fallen into
starting positions because we
did not have anyone else. We
have enough experienced play-
ers to take the pressure off
them if we need to, however,’
explained Meunch.

“Tim Goddell will probably
start at catcher allowing last
year’s back-up Jim Kaulius to
move to third base. Jim
Richards and Sid Osborne are
battling to start at short-stop,
battling to start at short-
stop,” he continued.

Rounding out the infield will
be Tom Yearwood at second
and either Tim Nichols or Tim
McDowell at first.

The schedule for the Cats’
will be as tough as it has ever
been. Non-conference games
will be played with Connecti-
cutt, Marietta, Wake Forest,
N.C. State and South Caro-
lina, who will be out for
revenge after losing at home to
Davidson last year en route to
a second place NCAA finish.

‘‘We have a hardworking
bunch of players who have
good speed and play good
defense. I think we will be a
fun team to watch,’’ concluded
Meunch.
