THE DAVIDSONIAN

OPINIONS

MONDAY, JANUARY 22, 1996 9

Everybody should honestly
rejoice. It’s sad, I know, that some-
body can write into a school paper
professing only their religion. I’m
no expert on religion, but I just
need to speak my mind. Did you
know that there is absolutely no
meaning on earth without God?
The entire universe means nothing
without a greater purpose. There is
no greater feeling in the world than
having no doubt in your heart for
yourself. At the same time, there is
no real feeling of self-confidence,
just a certain knowledge of imper-
fection and the absolute inevitabil-
ity of failure.

Iam going to fail, many times,
yet this is not a worry. We are
backed up by an incredible power.
Even writing this I tend to doubt
myself. There is, however, more
meaning than my personal quality.
Everybody wonders if they are re-
ally as good as the next. As I write
Ithink am] better than some people
because I have the courage to write
this to The Davidsonian, and that I
am certainly going to receive ac-
claim from Christians for being so
passionate in my beliefs. These
are in fact very new beliefs. I
continually remind myself that I
write not for myself but for others,
to alleviate fears of imperfection..

Actually, this whole thought
process has been instigated by an
article in the December 3rd issue
of Parade magazine about Rene
Russo. Itis incredibly recommend-
able. It contains irrefutable truth.
Don’t think I’m really cool, either,
for being able to express myself so
confidently, without worry for oth-
ers. This is inside every single

human being alive. I have thought
for a while that I am really incom-
petent, not measuring up. Nothing
feels better than getting relief from
those fears, and I’m just trying to
help other people. I will continue
to doubt myself and yet it is really
senseless.

See if you can find that issue
of Parade. Rene Russo says in it
that her whole life has been an
experiment in insecurity. She had
an incredibly difficult childhood
with a working mother and no fa-
ther. She was extremely depressed
and convinced of her own incom-
petence. Then she was picked up
for modeling and actually was very
successful. And yet she always
wanted more. _

Inher 30s she said, “I took off
four years and studied theology. I
went to my churchwhere they give
classes. Quite frankly, it’s the best
thing I’ve ever done. It taught me
whatI’d been looking for. [learned
that what I needed to give me the
self-esteem I didn’t have was faith.
Faith is knowing that I’ ve been put
on this earth with certain gifts and
certain goals and that I’m going to
end up where I’m supposed to —
no matter what I’m going through
right now. When you have faith,
you can’thelp but accept yourself.

For the first time I realized there
was no reason to be hard on my-
self. Suddenly I didn’t care what
other people thought of me. I was

fine just the way I was. And what-_

ever I chose to do next, I didn’t
care if I failed.”

Later in the article, she says
that “the way I feel about myself
today is so different than even five
years ago that it’s exciting. [have
real moments of joy now, and I
know it will continue.” Man, doI
feel better. If we are constantly
concerned with ourselves then we
are completely subjectto the whims
of our own self-doubt. I’ve tried
lately to couateract tendencies in
self-doubt, and I can swear to you
that this is the only answer, There
is absolutely no other way. You
can say “come on, just be confi-
dent.” You're as good as him, but
eventually your doubts will come
creeping back and you'll have to
Start all over, saying “okay, just act
confident.”

Maybe that’s it, and coolness
flows from that. With God, there is
absolutely noconcern for anything
that happens to us in this world.
I’m talking to people because I
want them to share my joy. I
swear. I’ve been kind of down for
awhile. There is no meaning out-

side of God, and I feel this so
strongly. I am so incredibly un-
concerned about how I appear that
Ican write this in The Davidsonian,
whereas previously I was con-
stantly in knots about how I would
look. I tell you it is impossible to
go through life concerned with ap-
pearance. It simply doesn’t work,
and the answer is faith.

Without faith nothing has.

meaning, and we as humans mea-
sure ourselves, feel incompetent
and cast around for true life. Boy
this is great. I don’t need to run
along too long. You guys are un-
derstanding me. Please just join
me in having not the slightest care
in how you come off. You are
destined to fail. So I’m not being
cheesy. I’m being real. There are
really no worries. So sit down and
stop worrying. F’s, C’s, livingina
gutter, they are uncomfortable, but
do they really have anything to do
with ultimate meaning?

Now I must struggle not to get
cocky about sending this to The
Davidsonian. 1 am proud of my-
self. It really makes me feel good,
and yet I am one person. I am
completely equal to everyone else.

I wish I could convince you of the ©

utter truth of this statement. I’m
not really thinking about it either.

It’s just flowing out onto the paper.
So thank God I’m doing better.
Man, I could write a book. I really
don’t want to quit. I hope you get
my drift. There is a little more I
could say.

Anyway, join me. It might
take a while of self-inspection and .
the like, but just remember that we
are absolutely not responsible for
our own imperfections, We have
been acted for. Without this,
knowledge is fear and fear is no
fun. Iam going to make an incred-
ible number of mistakes and that
makes me so happy. I’m onahigh
and I can’t get down. This is the
only joy that there is. Boy, does
one thank God. Forgive me for
being such an nontrusting guy be-
fore. Now [honestly fear nothing,
and I’m stire you can imagine how
that would feel. Nothing is in my
hands. It’s weird too because I’ ve
been wondering about things fora
while and this hasn’t really come
up. I was wondering — well, how
can you surrender your pride to
God? I don’t think I can do it.
Well, faith is just that, declaring
that you are subject to God. Other
than this, life’s meaning is nil. And
this happened today. It’s not like I
decided anything.

I’mlucky that this came about
so early in life. Whereas before,
my future was cloudy and looked
really not fun, it now sits before me
like great fun. I will have troubles,
but I'll always be able to come
back and look at this letter. I also
tell you how great it feels to have
no pride—a truly wonderful feel-
ing. Itis nice to be so convinced of
something.

More nonsense

This is it. The last Opinions
section published under the shadow
of El Jefe — my apartment mate.
Of course, what would be an Opin-
ions section without the. majority
of the articles written by Apart-
ment 201 B.

Keeping with tradition I oblige
my pleading buddy, dust off the
ole Macintosh LC II, build a chair
out of my dirty clothes pile, and
proceed to write the ultimate Opin-
ions article. In the following para-
graphs, I will attempt to write on
such an array of subjects that every
reader will find at least one thing
interesting. If you don’t find any-
thing, then call #$%$ and com-
plain.

First off, for all you NBA fans,
Hakeem (the ‘H’ is silent, the ‘O’
isn’t) Olajuwon’s autobiography
is coming out in February. In the
book he will talk about the last two
playoffs as well as his personal

road to the top. The book is sup- -

posedly written in reportedly clear
English. Hmmmmm. Check your
local book store.

Also in February, for all you
film buffs, the Sundance Institute
(closely linked to the Sundance
Film festival established by Rob-
ert Redford 15 years ago) will
launch a cable television channel.
The channel, starting the 23rd, will
specialize in independent and cut-
ting-edge movies, uncut and com-
mercial free, according toThe Salt
Lake Tribune. ,

By the way, the festival started
last Thursday and lasts ten days in

Park City, Utah.

’ For all of you looking for a
new fad, it’s peanuts. Not the
already shelled peanuts that come
in that bottle with the walking pea-

nut wearingthetophatandmonocle -

on the label.. No, it’s Jimbo’s Jum-
bos. Salted. You can find them in
the produce section of Harris
Tweeters. Sure, you may hate pea-
nuts or it may not sound appealing
to you right now, but I’m telling
you, I bought a bag yesterday and
started eating them as I walked
around campus—instant coolness.
You have one, you’re hooked.

In case your wondering, pea-
nuts take the place of sunflower
seeds on the number one cool food
list once baseball season ends. Try
‘em.

- For those of you who like ex-
ercise, namely hoops, I’m sorry to
report that there still aren’t any
nets on the court behind Martin
Court F.

Actually, I haven’t checked in
acouple of days, but I’ m willing to
bet I’m right. If anyone has a
couple empty fruit baskets we can
relive the early years (ask a trivia
freak if you don’t follow me).

Scientists discovered the miss-
ing mega byte yesterday. You can
read all about it in Science World.

Ok, here is a riddle for all you
gamers out there. Three guys go to
a restaurant and eat. The bill is
$30, so they each pay $10. In the
back, the waiter/waitress realizes
that the bill is really only $25. Not

she pockets two dollars and gives
.each of the guys one dollar back.
Therefore each guy paid nine dol-
lars for the meal. Nine times three
is $27; plus the two dollars the
waiter/waitress pocketed equals
$29. What happened to the miss-

Again, if you need a hint, call
$*%&.

Well, that’s the end of the ul-
timate article. I hope you found
something of interest. The riddle
is not a play on words, and most of
you will probably think it’s obvi-

ous and stupid, but I found it to be
beautiful and profound. One friend
back home explained it as “the
mathematical black hole.” Oh,
yeah. I made up the mega byte:
story just to please all you who like
tabloids, or something. Peace.
