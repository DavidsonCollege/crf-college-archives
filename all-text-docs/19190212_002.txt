THE COLLEGE Y. M. Cc. AL

When the S. A. ‘Tr. C. was establish-
ed in the colleges, the Y. M. C. A. also
‘sent men to help look after the welfare
of the men. Now though the S. A. ‘P.
C. is disbanded, in a great many cases
the ¥ man is left. ‘These men should
receive more hearty support from the
college men. ‘Vhey show a great deal
of enthusiasm when it comes to the pic-
ture shows, reading matter, ete., fur-
nished by the Y. M. C. A. but very
little in regard to the weekly services
which they also furnish ‘in the person of
their representative. .

This should not be, while the picture
‘shows are meant for them to enjoy, the
religious services are meant for them to
get some benefit. from, and it) seems
hardly tair for the men to accept the
recreations which the Y gives them and
not be willing to help boost the work for
which it is primarily intended, the bet:
terment of the morals of young men.

SINGING ON THE CAMPUS.

One thing that seems to have died out
with the S. A. ‘D.C. is the singing on
the campus. During the fall it seemed
that the fellows were always. singing.
The strains of familiar songs like "Pack
Up Your Troubles,” ‘There's a Long.
Long Trail” and “Smile” could be heard
many times during the day, especially
when the fellows were marching to mess
and were coming in from drill. Almost
every night just before taps fellows could
be heard singing in front of the dormi-
tories. Even up in chapel the very walls
were made to tingle.

Since Christmas, however, everything
seems to have changed. The singing up
in chapel these mornings is pitiful. It is
all done by the few men around the
piano, What little singing is done around
on the campus is fine, but there is hardly
any of it.

As we all know. one of the very best

ways a fellow can keep up his spirits is
by singing. It drives away the blues and
makes a man feel full of pep. Can there
be any doubt, therefore, why the mill-
tary authorities encouraged — singing
among our soldiers, and why our army
became known as “the singing army?”
OF course, not all of us can sing well,
but we can at least carry a tune, and
even if we can't we're mighty glad to
listen to those who can, and con encour-
age them. rp

KOUIPMENT NEEDED FOR GYMNASIUM.

Through the loyalty and) generosity
of her alumni, Davidson has recently
been presented with a large and hand-
sume gymnasiain, At present, however,
the apparatus, so necessary for a really
good pymnasium, is lacking: and conse-
quently the students of Davidson lose an
opportunity for much pleasant and
profitable recreation, “The outdoor
“gyi” fills this gap to some extent, but
it cannot wholly compensate for the lack
ot equipment,

Some steps have already been taken
toward supplying at least a small amount
of apparatus. Last vear cach of the
four classes in college bought a small
Liberty bond, to be donated to the col-
lege and used for the improvement of
the gymnasium. Up to the present time,
however, nothing further has been done
and there seems to be no prospect of the
work being accomplished this year.

Since the student body of Davidson has
begun this work, why should it not carry
it through te completion, It has been
customary for each Senior class to make
a parting gift to the college as it goes out
from her walls. Why could not these
gifts for the next few years take the
form of weights and bars to be used in
the gymnasium? No gift could be more
useful to the college. R.

THE KNOCKER.

You never saw a rich man laugh at
a poor man. You never saw an athlete
sneer at a cripple. “You never saw a
deep and true student make fun of an
illiterate. And you never will.

A man seldom looks down on his in-
ferior, or med less fortunate than he.
The man who habitually criticizes and
knocks—koocks those who are better
than he is, and the knocker knows it.
Jealousy is the root of all knocking, and
the man who indulges in continual fault-
finding will search himself in vain for
any other motive. If such a student
will substitute for his petty self-center-
edness and conceitedness, an carnest amu-
bition to reach the levels of those whom
he knocks, he will become of greater
service to humanity and especially to
Davidson.

It may be found everywhere. Evil
sneérs at poodness, ignorance at educa-
tion, error at trath, impurity at purity.
Fellow students, don’s forget that a
helpful, not a knocking, criticism about
the college helps to litt it up. Don't be
a knocker. be an optimist. Don't ask
for milk when vou see the cream pitcher.

H. M. MARVIN
GOKS TO ARMENIA

H. M. Marvin. ‘14. has just received
an appointment to go to Armenia in
medical relief work. He will leave be-
fore the 15th of February. He and an-
other doctor will have charge of a hos-
pital of one hundred beds.

Marvin graduated from Davidson in
1914. He was one of the leaders in
the student activities on the campus. He
was on the  intelcollegiate debating
team: an honor roll student during his
whole course here; and leaving here he
graduated from Harvard Medical
School in February, 1917, with honors.
Since that time he has been working in
a hospital under the direction of the
Surgeon General of the Army, fitting
himself to go across as an army surgeon.

The Forum

THE FRESH MEN'S LACK OF COURTESY.

Freshmen on the campus are not as
they used to be. Perhaps, to those who
were here during the S. A. ‘I. C. the
fact is not so striking. Life on the
campus being so abnormal, the older men
became accustomed to lapses that are
very apparent to those returning. “To
them it is painfully noticeable that the
Freshmen have not the Davidson spirit,
the spirit of democracy and courtesy.

The thing especially in the mind of
the writer is the fact that a great many
of the present class make no pretense of
speaking. ‘his, one of the oldest. cus-
tomsin the college, is one of the most
delightful things about Davidson. It is
the thing which most impresses — the
strangers on the campus. The men most
severely criticised are. those who do not
extend this courtesy. [t marks a man
more than any one thing. [tis the very
expression of Davidson democracy.

We cannot afford to let such a custom
decline. Some influential, man should
speak to the class, telling them the tra-
ditions and customs of the college. Can
you hold a man responsible for mistakes
such as this, when he does not know
what is expected of him?

GET ON THE TRACK.

The spring-like days of the past weck
remind us that the track season is ap-
proaching. Out of last year's team only
two letter men have returned, these be-
ing J. FE. McQueen and H. P. Murrey.
In the recent elections McQueen was
elected captain and Murrey manager of
the team. ,

‘The date for the annual field meet has
not yet been determined. ‘This meet will
bring out the most promising material
from which the Varsity squad will be
chosen. Altho handicapped by the lack
of old men returning, prospects look
good and Davidson is sure to turn out
a-successful team,

Davidson will enter the State meet
and will also enter the All-Southern
meet held at Georgia Tech.

LIBRARY BOOKS.

Among the new books that have been
received recently in the library that will
interest the students most are: “In the
Heart of a Fool.” White; “Tin Sol-
diers.” Bailey: “An American Family.”
Webster: “The W. P. Trail.” Jane
Grey; “Cheerful by, Request.” Ferber:
“Winds of Chance.” Beach: “Call of
the Offshore Wind,” Paine; “Valley of
the Giants.” Kyre.

Ata mecting of the football “D" men
