Movie Review
Interview
with a
Vampire
confusing,
disjointed

By Tammy Tiska
Ithink Ishould have read Anne
Rice’s book IJnterview with the

Vampire before I went to see the .

movie. I just didn’t get it. Well,
there is not much to get in the first
half. Louis (Brad Pitt) feels bad
about being a vampire and Lestat
(Tom Cruise) tells him to get over
it. I got that part. But I was totally
lost in the second half when
Armand (Antonio Banderas) and
his French vampires kill Louis’
little vampire daughter, Claudia. I
could only assume that Armand
was in love with Louis and was
jealous of his co-dependent rela-
tionship with Claudia. Several
people have already tried to ex-
plain the logistics of the story, but
to no avail.

I could have spent the movie
pondering the deeper issues it
raised: our fear of death, the long-
ing for immortality, the necessity
of growth in order to stay alive, etc.
But I was fascinated with the little
things: were those really Tom
Cruise’s teeth? Why did the police
never wonder who was killing all
those people and drinking their
blood? What did the vampires do
with all the bodies? Can vampires
have children? If they are flesh and
blood, do they need to eat real
food? Questions like this probably
have simple answers, but were still
distracting. :

But the most distracting as-
pect of the mof#ie was Tom Cruise’s
performance. At no point in the
film did I ever truly believe he was
a nineteenth-century vampire. He
just looked like he would have
been more comfortable trading in
his lace and frills for a leather
jacket and a pair of Ray-Bans. He
works in the last scene of the movie
though, as he’s driving a red con-
vertible across the Golden Gate
bridge, turning up the rock song on
the radio and flashing a grin. He
suddenly fits. I was still left won-
dering how a vampire learned to
drive.

Despite the garbled dialogue,
the disappointing special effects,
the confusion for all of us unaware
of the finer points of vampirehood,

_ and the miscasting of Cruise, the
changing color of Pitt’s eyes was a
source of endless fascination and
made the whole film worthwhile.

, And besides, I got to take. Mike

~. New to his first movie since Forrest
Gump, and he was more confused
than I was.

The Davidson College Syasphony Orchestra begins its
FIRST Season with a pexforonance in Love AudrroRiua.

By Elizabeth Lockett

It had been 40 years since
symphonic music filled the air of
Love Auditorium. With the
inaugural concert on Thursday,
November 17, 1994, the
Davidson College Symphony
Orchestra, conducted by Dr.
Richard Prior, amazed the
students, faculty, and community
of Davidson with a premier
performance they will never
forget.

The program started with the
ever-so-popular Fanfare for the
Common Man, a work written by
20th century composer Aaron
Copland:solely for percussion
and brass.

Ringing from the balcony
above, the sonorous crash of the
bass drum startled the audience,
literally lifting people out of their

seats. With intensity and
enthusiasm, the piece continued
in a pompous fashion. Although
the percussion was a.little
abrasive, the energy provided an
incredible excitement for the
music yet to come.

’ The program then changed
its tone with Bach’s
Brandenburg Concerto No. 5.
The Baroque piece, a concerto
grosso, consists of three move-
ments with an alternation
between the main orchestral
group and three soloists.

Exploiting Bach’s choice of
instrumentation and arrange-
ment, the orchestra featured the

. fabulous talents of three soloists

as well as the orchestra. With
the extended harpsichord
cadenza, Cynthia Lawing
captured the audience with her

aptitude and genius.

The other two soloists,
violinist Jane Hart and flutist
Jennifer Dior, also performed

beautifully, maintaining a perfect

balance and musical interaction
among the three instruments
throughout the second move-
ment.

More importantly, the
remaining orchestral group not
only played the notes of the piece
perfectly but shaped the piece
impeccably to reach a height of
passionate music.

Once’ again; the musicality
of the orchestra, in particular the
string section, shone through the
performance of Mozart’s
Symphony No. 29 in A Major.
Headed by concertmaster
Amanda Merrill, the strings’
intonation and dynamic shaping

allowed for elegant musical
phrasing.

The piece, in the classical
sonata form, contains four
movements varying in tempo and
mood which allowed the
orchestra to display their musical
adaption. Despite the fact that
the French horns had some
inharmonious moments, the
orchestra did a fine job of
performing an extensive and
demanding work.

Filling Love Auditorium
with friends and supporters, the
student comprised orchestra
successfully filled the dream to
share and rekindle a love for
music. With such an impressive
first performance, we all look
forward with anticipation to a
future of wonderful things to
come.

Over the hills and through the woods...

- By Courtauld McBryde
This past semester, students
have explored the rivers and moun-
tains of North Carolina. Canoe-

_ ing, rafting, kayaking, backpack-
~ ing, and mountain biking are only

a few of the activities Davidson
Outdoors offers for students and
faculty. :

Over. Christmas break
Davidson Outdoors is offering two
amazing, adventurous trips to top
off the year before the spring se-
mester begins. The Gulf sailing
trip runs from January 4 through
15 and costs $325, which includes
transportation, food, equipment,
and the actual trip itself. The sec-

ond trip is canoeing in the Ever-
glades, which costs $175. These
trips would normally cost twice
as much as the price Davidson
Outdoors offers students.
“These trips are designed for
those people who want to go and
- do something at the end of Christ-
‘mas break when all their friends
from home have gone back to |,
school,” says Rob Clemens,
Davidson Outdoors’ student
leader.
Participation in Davidson
Outdoors’ trips this semester has
been explosive, ranging from the
