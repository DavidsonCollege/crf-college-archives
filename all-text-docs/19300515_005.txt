THE DAVIDSONIAN, MAY 15, 1930

Wilson’s Life Depicted
In Remarkable Picture

Film Shows Many Scenes From His
Life Before and After His
Presidency

WAS MAN OF VIGOR

Scenes From His Public and Civilian

Life Are Shown

On Friday night, May 9th, the students,
faculty members, and townspeople of Da-
vidson were privileged to see an excellent
motion picture representation of the life
of Woodrow Wilson in his later years of
public activity and renown, beginning
with scenes of his life as governor of New
Jersey, and concluding with scenes of his
death and burial. This: remarkable film,
now obtainable by the state for $50,000.00,
has been widely rated by observers as
comparable only to a visit from the Pres-
ident himself.

Following the scenes of his life as gov-
ernor of New Jersey, his first presidential
campaign, election, and inauguration were
depicted. Then excerpts were shown from
his life at the White House, his reelection,

Next were shown some of the prepara-
tory steps taken in the World War, fol-
lowing the vain efforts of the President
to keep the United States out of the con-
flict and strife then raging in Europe.
These included the public speeches, the
clamor, and the mobilization of the Amer-
ican forces, all so vivid and so vibrant in
their appeal to the Americans of the pres-
ent day.

Consistent with the completeness of the
film other aspects, even actual battle
scenes were shown, portraying the bloody
struggle of the nations in all its horror
and gruesomeness, Bloodshed, gaunt pri-
vation, despair, and depraved mental con-
ditions were ever apparent, but ever off-
set by the urge of patriotism, the spirit
of “those who went over,” as they con-
sidered the welfare of “those back at
home,” for whom they were fighting.

\rmistice scenes then followed, bring-
ing into light ‘the great relief experienced
by the nation after such heartrending
scenes as had preceded the final cessa-
tion of hostilities.

Following these were portrayed the
President's trips to Europe in the inter-
est of peace, and_ his endeavors, while
there, to create and stabilize international

good-will,

Concluding the picture, but in no way
less stirring than the rest, was a repre-
sentation of the declining years, the death
and burial, of the President, followed by
commentaries, or attestations to the great-
ness of the President, written by mem-
bers of his cabinet, leaders of the allied
forces, and other contemporaries.

It is remarkable how so many and such
stirring events can be reviewed through
the medium of the life of this one man;
yet after seeing the picture, the reason
becomes President Wilson
Was a man of stamina, of vigor; he per-
continual stream of energy,
combined in all its latent power, dedicated
to the America and mankind.

Friday night the whole party was
given a picnic supper on the new Duke
campus. After the picnic the party was

taken through the new buildings, which
will in all probability be occupied by the
Duke students ‘at the opening of school
next fall. The professors learned that the
old building would be used to accom-
modate the girls who attend the univer-
sity next year. Profs. Porter and Davis,
visited the Davidson alumni there at the
