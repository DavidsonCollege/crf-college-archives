The Board of Trustees approved a 14.5
percent increase in tuition and fees for the
school year 1986-87 at their meeting Fri-
day, Feb. 21. Discussion over the Presi-
dent’s proposed budget started Nov. I,
1985, and the approved increase reflects
various changes in budget caused by what
Comptroller Robert Davidson identifies as
“external factors,” including major mainte-
nance concerns, computer purchases, and
employment of additional faculty.

This tuition increase is the largest in six
years. College president John Kuykendall
acknowledged the increase as “substantial”
but justified in providing such “worthy and
necessary factors in assuring a liberal arts
education of first quality.”

Davidson regards such an increase in
budget as generally unpredictable and re-
lated to a continuation of charges in external
factors. No particular cause can be singled
out for this year’s increase. Davidson said
that the tuition and fees usually increase on
an average of eight to 10 percent each year

Friday, March 14, 1986 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Trustees raise tuition

and that perhaps the school’s effort to keep
costs down may have caught up with the
budget.

In terms of financial aid, Davidson re-
gards the college as “determined to meet
aid.” Included in the budget is an increase
of 33 percent in financial aid provisions.
The Office of Financial Aid assures the con-
tinuation of its policy to meet each student’s
demonstrated financial need and does not
anticipate any problems in supporting addi-
tional assistance.

Major concerns which the Board says
cannot wait any longer and for which the
budget hopes to provide include repairs of
the roof and basement of the Chambers
building, the renovation of worn dor-
mitories, the purchase of both hardware and
software for
academic use, and the employment of addi-
tional staff for instruction and maintenance
of the computers. The Trustees also hope
that the college will be able to apply a por-
tion of the new budget toward the re-estab-
lishment of a one to 12 faculty/student ratio.

NCAA ticket availability, prices cause confusion

By DAVID WILLIAMS

The Athletic Department and
the Wildcat Club obtained and
distributed approximately 440
single-game tickets this week
among students, faculty, and staff
for tonight’s 9:37 NCAA tourna-
ment match-up between Davidson
and Kentucky in the Charlotte
Coliseum.

According to Wildcat Club
Director Sandy Carnegie, the
NCAA originally allotted David-
son a number of book tickets for
all of the Charlotte games of the
NCAA tournament, _ because
Davidson is co-host with UNCC
of the Charlotte games. The
Wildcat Club sold virtually all
these tickets last fall as part of the
Davidson basketball season ticket
package.

After Davidson gained an au-
tomatic bid to the NCAA tourna-
ment by beating University of
Tennessee-Chattanooga for the
Southern Conference Champion-
ship, the NCAA automatically al-
jotted Davidson 250 book tickets,
at a price of $45 each, as part of

standard procedure. These 250
tickets originally covered all the
tournament games played in Char-
lotte.

“But late Monday moming,”
Carnegie said, “we were told that
our allotment from the NCAA was
250 single-game tickets,” costing
$15 each.

Athletic Director Kit Morris
said, “We decided to distribute the
250 tickets evenly between our
‘internal’ constituency —stu-
dents, faculty and staff — and our
‘external’ constituency
alumni, season ticket holders, and
top donors.” Athletic officials de-
cided to allocate 50 tickets for bas-
ketball players and coaches, 100
tickets for the ‘internal’ consti-
tuency, and another 100 for the
‘external’ constituency.

According to Morris, “We had
originally discussed a first-come,
first-serve ticket distribution for
faculty, students, and staff, but
Math Professor J.B. Stroud, the
faculty athletics representative,
recommended we distribute them
on a lottery basis.” Athletic offi-

— - = =

cials heeded Stroud’s recommen-
dation and decided to hold a sign-
up for a ticket lottery this past
Monday, which would randomly
distribute the tickets.

Over 680 students, faculty,
and staff signed up for the ticket
lottery. On Tuesday, ticket office
petsonnel posted initial results of
the lottery, which showed that 100
tickets had been allocated for
those requesting tickets.

However, according to Car-
negie, “In the meantime we
Started trying to wheel and deal
with other schools to do what we
could to get more tickets. We also
contacted NCAA officials and
Coliseum officials, and they said
we could get more tickets.”

By Wednesday, another 340
students, faculty, and staff were
allotted tickets for a total of 440
tickets granted out of 681 re-
quests. “We are lucky to know
Tom Scott, who is the Tourna-
ment Coordinator in Charlotte and
Athletic Director Emeritus of
Davidson,” Morris said. He added
that Scott, who is also a former

chairman of the NCAA tourna-
ment committee, arranged for
Davidson to obtain an initial 250
$15 single-game tickets, rather
than the original $45 book tickets
covering all the games. “He also
was able to secure for us addi-
tional single-game tickets ,” Mor-
ris said.

Carnegie said, “I feel that
those people who were not able to
get tickets from the ticket office
will most likely be able to find
tickets before the game.” He
noted that by the time Davidson
plays Friday night, three losers
will already be determined, and
that the fans of these teams will be
more than willing to sell their tick-
ets to Davidson fans.

Morris said, “I think it’s al-
ways dangerous to promise what
you can’t deliver, and we didn’t
want to raise hopes that we could
accomodate all the desires of the
community when we couldn’t. I
think we have made a significant
and substantial effort to seat as
many of our people in the Col-
iseum as want tickets.”

Morris added; “As difficult a
position as it is to be in, it certainly
beats the alternative — not play-
ing. I hope that our method of dis-
tributing tickets, as awkward as it
has been, has not turned people
off, because it’s a celebration we
want everyone to join in. The size

‘of: out ‘school makes us feel like

family, and it’s always tough
when you’re faced with the pros-
pect of leaving family members
out of a reunion.”

Carnegie said; “After the
Wildcats win Friday night, we
have a good chance of getting
quite a few tickets for Sunday's
game.” If Davidson beats Ken-
tucky tonight, the Davidson ticket
office will sell tickets for sunday's
game on a first-come, first-serve
basis beginning at noon on Satur-
day.

“We are really pleased with
the tremendous turnout of faculty,
students, and staff that have
signed up for the lottery, and | am
sure the coaches and the team ap-
preciate the support,” Carnegie
said.
