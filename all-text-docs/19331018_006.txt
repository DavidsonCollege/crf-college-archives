hard-fought imbroglio being 6 to 0.

In three contests, Duke has tallied
69 points to their opponents’ 8; hav-
ing played four games, Davidson is
credited with 40 points, while their
opponents are chalked up with 19.

But the Blue Devils, although it was |

their first game of the season, looked

scored in each quarter, and threat-|impressive in crushing V. M. I, 37-6,
ened.on occasions when they could! Whereas the 'Cats found themselves

hard pressed \Jast Saturday to win by
one touchdoWn. Moreover, Duke will
have a distinct advantage over the
Wildcats on account of having met
Tennessee, whose system of play is
the same as that of Davidson.

Both teams should be able to put
their full strength on the field next
Saturday. Captain Charlie Rives, who

sustained a knee injury in the game
with Carolina, had recovered suffi-
ciently to see service in the game last
week, and Willson, ’Cat fullback, and
Cathey, tackle, will probably be in
condition by game time.

Davidson will have trouble in hold-
ing the Blue Devil forward wall, which
consists of such bone-breakers as
|Freddy Crawford, Dunlap, and Dur-
lner. In the backfield, Duke will have
the fast-moving Corky Cornelius, who
made all ten points gained by his team
in the Tennessee game, and the sa-
{gacious Nick Laney, the “Crooning

| Halfback.”

But the Blue Devils will run up
lagainst one of the fastest and best
\backflelds in the state when players
such as Pittman, Hutchins, Mackorell,
Wingfield, Willson, and Verble get
into action. Once under way, the ’Cat
pony backs will be hard to bring
down.

NICK LANEY TO PLAY FOR
PAN-HELLENIC DANCES

(Continued from page 1)
Nick Laney has been announcing this
group of dances in Duke during the
| past week.

The Council reports that tickets are
now on sale for the group of dances,
the price for the series being three
dollars, while the tickets, if bought
separately, will amount to two dollars
for the Friday night dance and the
admission Saturday night, one dollar
and a half. Tickets may be obtained
from any member of the Pan-Hellenic
Council.

Most of the social fraternities, of
course, are sponsoring house parties
for this week-end, and are expecting
a large number of girls for this, the
first school dance of the year.

Taking into consideration the time
and trouble which have been put into
the plans, Davidson students may ex-
