Football boasts largest roster under Landis

By Matr Pitzer

This season, more than ever,
time will tell the story for the Wild-
cats.

Forced to fill many holes from
last year’s squad, the Wildcats will
turn to their class of 30 freshmen
and numerous sophomores to play
many key roles.

“Tf we can stay patient,” coach
Tim Landis said, “we can progress
and become a good football team.
With all the youth we have, we

three players (Bryan Kern, John
Blake and Dan Jonas) are compet-
ing for the tailback job.

In explaining his decision to
go with a more conservative of-
fense, Landis said he and his
coaches wanted a style of play that
would better complement the
team’s excellent defense. Despite
last season’s 3-7 record, the de-
fense had some of the better statis-
tics in the nation. ;

“We want a really solid run-
ning game with real ball-control
passing,” Landis said. “Mostteams
like to have a quick-hitting offense
to go with a tough defense, but that
can work against you, because the
defense is out there so long and
gets worn down. We felt we’ve
established a tradition on defense.

Now we feel that we’re going to
have a better combination of the
offense and defense.”

On the defense line, literally
the biggest hole to fill is the one left
by 6-4, 285-pound lineman Mills
Ariail.

However, the three people
who started alongside him, Bo
Bartholomew, James Cassidy and
Matt Eckert, will all return.

“Only patience and time will
tell how good the defense is,”
Landis said. “I think that we’ll
have more of a finesse defense.
They have the potential to be a
really good defense.”

That seems to be the team’s
whole story, which will start writ-
ing itself Sept. 9 at home against
the University of the South.

really need to have heavy concen-
tration and repetition.” FOOTBALL

To help with that, the Wild-
cats have their largest roster ever
under Landis, with 70 players cur- S C HEDULE
rently on the squad. With only eight é
seniors, the majority of the team is Sept. 9 Univ. of the South 1:30
made up of freshmen and sopho-
mores — many of whom have Sept. 16 Maryville 1:30
played little or no college football.

For instance, Davidson must | Sept. 23 at Emory & Henry 1:30
find a new quarterback, but none
of the six quarterbacks on the team Sept. 30 at Guilford 1:30
has taken a snap in college. Cur- ;
rently, the race for the starting job | Oct. 7 at Washington & Lee 2:00
appears to be between sophomore

To further complicate things, Oct. 21 at Randolph-Macon 1:30
the Wildcats are switching from
