Another disgraced slugger: What to make of A-Rod?

Curis YOUNG
Staff Writer

Alex Rodriguez has been called many
things throughout his career.

He was widely considered one of the best
young players ever when he broke into the
league. He was supposed to be the savior
of the Mariners when he played with Ken
Griffey, Jr, then the savior of the Texas
Rangers. Finally, he was supposed to be the
superstar that led the Yankees back to base-
bali’s Promised Land.

On the flip-side, he has been considered
cocky and arrogant. He has been called
greedy for taking his record contract from
the Rangers and leaving the Mariners scram-
bling. A-Rod furthermore has been called a
team-killer, as his new teams have regressed
while his former teams generally improve.

The superstar has run the gamut in the
baseball world. One thing he has always
been called, though, is clean. Following the
steroids era, he has been touted the savior of
baseball’s hallowed record books. He would
be the clean, upstanding athlete that would
wipe Barry Bonds’ name off of baseball’s
most cherished record: the all-time homerun
leader.

With the revelation that Rodriguez, in
2003, tested positive for anabolic steroids,
the baseball world has been turned on its
head. In tests that actually could lead to no
punishment (baseball had not yet implement-
ed penalties for steroid use in 2003) and were
supposed to remain confidential, baseball’s
savior tested positive for the performance en-
hancer Primobolan as well as unusually high
levels of testosterone.

Davidson started the game slowly, falling
behind 10-2 and later 29-20. They took their
first lead with under two minutes remaining
in the first half and jumped out of the gates
quickly after halftime to grab a 60-46 lead
with 13 minutes to play. The Wildcats seemed
poised to salt the game away, but Charleston
erased the lead with an 18-3 run over the next
eight minutes to claim a 64-63 lead on Dustin
Scott’s put-back.

Johnson broke a 68-all tie with a lay-up
and two foul shots on back-to-back posses-
sions sandwiched around a turnover by Ar-
chambault to give Charleston a 72-68 lead
with 1:42 to play. Lovedale brought David-
son within two with 52 seconds to play be-
fore White Jr. hit a jumper with 34 seconds
remaining to restore the margin.

Curry missed two three-pointers, forc-
ing the Wildcats to foul with 19 seconds to
play. Andrew Goudelock made both shots,
and Barr answered with two at the other end.
Wiggins missed two shots with 8 seconds to
play, and Curry was able to draw a foul on a
three-point attempt with 3.8 seconds to play.
His three made free throws equaled his entire
second half output to that point and made the
score 76-75. White Jr. made one free throw

to account for the final margin and set up the

The baseball world has been shocked
by the leaked information, and Rodriguez’s
reputation is forever damaged. His posi-
tive tests will bring up several questions as
to baseball’s handling of the situation, and I
will attempt to address a few in this piece.

First, does this damage A-Rod’s bid
to the Hall of Fame? I believe that Hall of
Fame credentials should be based upon how
players compared to their contemporaries.
For example, I do not think we can compare
Mickey Mantle to Babe Ruth, or Rodriguez
to Lou Gehrig. Baseball has too many vari-
ables.

As more names become public (and we
will likely hear about 103 more from the 2003
tests), it becomes more apparent that only a
scant minority of players over the past fifteen
years has avoided the use of performance en-
hancers. It is a crude and unfortunate gener-
alization, but we can assume that nearly ev-
eryone in Major League Baseball took some
shady measures in order to compete.

In other words, if we want to completely
blast Bonds, Rodriguez or Roger Clemens,
we need to consider that they were not alone,
but likely only the ones that got caught. Do
we need to wipe the steroid era out of baseball
history? I do not believe we can or should.
Treat it for what it is. Every era has had play-
ers taking various methods to enhance their
performances.

Second, should we really condemn these
players for using steroids? Again, I do not
believe we can or should. For many players,
use of performance enhancers meant the dif-
ference between financial stability for life and
bouncing around the minor leagues in buses.
The choice is obviously difficult given the

game’s final ill-fated play.

The Cougars’ greatest advantage lay in
their dominance in rebounding. They out-
rebounded Davidson 50-31, including a 19-
11 disparity on the offensive glass that led
to 19 second-chance points. Charleston also
shot 76 percent from the charity stripe for the
game (19-25). Davidson shot only 38 percent
from the floor for the game (23-60).

The Wildcats had greater luck Thursday
night before 11,000 fans in the Greensboro
Coliseum against the lowly Spartans. David-
son again struggled from the floor, mirroring
the 38 percent mark that would haunt the
Wildcats against the Cougars two days later.
Greensboro was slightly worse, however,
shooting only 37.3 percent.

Davidson was led by Curry’s 29 points
and a career night from Stephen Rossiter
’09. He had career-highs of 14 points and 13
rebounds to provide toughness on a night in
which the Wildcats struggled to dismiss one
of the Southern Conference’s cellar dwellers.
The Spartans opened the game with a 7-1 run
before giving up 16 unanswered points. They
would later close the gap to 26-20 with just
under five minutes to play in the first half be-
fore going down 37-24 at the break.

One final run by Greensboro saw the
Spartans trail by only six at 43-37. A missed
dunk signaled the end ¢ of their momentum,

ramifications, but we cannot judge unless we
have been put in a similar situation.

There are undoubtedly negative effects
when using steroids. They are not, however,
as obvious as generally perceived. In fact,
several studies have indicated that the effects
on grown men are generally not life-threat-
ening.

In terms of personal use, I do not believe
athletes owe baseball or many of its fans an
apology. They do, however, owe an apology
to the countless younger athletes who knew
Bonds used steroids, or Mark McGwire used
steroids, or now Alex Rodriguez used ste-
roids. Seeing the athletic prowess of these
steroid users has caused many in the younger
generation to view similar methods as ac-
ceptable.

While negative effects on full-grown bod-
ies may be overstated, the effect of steroids
on developing bodies is universally consid-
ered significant. They can stunt growth, and
cause many problems as young athletes grow
into their bodies.

Taken in a vacuum, I understand the use
of steroids by professional athletes. I under-
stand the millions of dollars and the ability to
support their families. Unfortunately, sports
do not exist ina vacuum. While they may not
want the responsibility, professional athletes
serve as role models to our young generation.
Highly visible athletes such as A-Rod carry
an even larger burden.

His mistake will resonate through the
baseball world, but its largest effect will not
be on baseball’s record books, as many sug-
gest. Instead, it will negatively affect count-
less athletes who idealize him.

To them, he owes an apology.
