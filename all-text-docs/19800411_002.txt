2 2—The sage ela 11, 1980

ti Connell om Campos and
Religious Life (CCRL) has not
yet tabulated the results of last
week’s student poll about the

‘Houses. |

The CCRL has already deci-
ded that one of them will be a
coed eating house beginning in
fall 1981, the proposed comple-
tion date for the Commons.

CCRL Chairman Jim Robert-
son said the CCRL has no
reason to count -ballots early
since the results will not be

‘released until the Council dis-
cusses the poll in its meeting
Monday.

“We don’t want. the students
to feel like the Council is bound
to the results of the straw vote.
It is not a referendum,” he said.
However, Robertson said the
overwhelming support for a
coed house in the previous poll
had considerable influence on
the CCRL’s decision.

Robertson said the CCRL will
probably decide on the social
arrangement for the second
eating house during their Mom
day meeting. However, since
the earliest the new houses will
open is fall 1981, Robertson
feels the CCRL decision is not of
pressing interest.

Robertson said the poll was
conducted this early to guaran-
tee that any opponents to the
CCRL decision would have time
to voice their concerns.

Ballots for the straw vote ran
out before the polling ended last
Wednesday. However, Robert-
son feels that since the CCRL
printed 1000 ballots, they got
an adequate sampling of stu-

_ dent opinion. He added that
anyone who did not get a chance
to vote could be. heard by the
CCRL. Robertson declined to
say how the CCRLmight actual-

Davidson Young Democrats
President Ed Lindsey said An-
derson’s honest manner is ap-
pealing to students. Another
reason for his popularity is the
general feeling of dissatisfaction
among voters for both parties’
frontrunning candidates, Lind-
sey said.

Lindsey said the Young Dem-
ocrats have been active distri-
buting absentee ballots to
North Carolina residents..

Lindsey added that most of
the group’s efforts to date

Last week, Doss slipped in
water in Carnegie’s hall and tore
her knee cartilage. The hall had
been flooded by a stopped ‘up
shower drain. Since the resi-
dents had repeatedly complain-
ed about the flooding and the
College took no action, Doss
said she will sue if the College
does not cover the costs she
incurred from her knee injury.

Bolding said he had heard
only one complaint about flood-
ing, which he did not think was

out of the ordinary.

The residents’ complaints al-
so include poor ventilation in
the kitchen, no ventilation in
the bathroom, abuses of the
kitchen by non-residents, and
the noise made at late hours by
some of the guests upstairs.

According to Bolding, a work
request had been entered with
the Physical Plant to install a

Congressional seat.

Dunbar said that aside from
the Club’s backing George
Bush, they have not been
involved in this year’s Presi-
dential race. He expects the
Young Republicans to become
active next fall when the race is
more clearly defined.

Eric Christensen of the
Young Libertarians said the
poll points up the “Anderson
chic’’ pervading college cam-
puses.

He also said that the third
eet talk generated by Ander-
son has aided the: Libertarian

party by drawing attention to

Bolding dismissed the resi-
dents’ complaints about noise,
maintaining that as is the usual
case in student housing, those
who complain about neighbors
disturbing them probably dis-
turb their neighbors just as
much.

Doss said she hopes her
threat of a lawsuit will spur the
Housing Office to give the
problems in Basement Carnegie
more serious consideration.

Minorities Committee

College President Samuel Spencer has appointed an 11-member
Committee on Minorities to monitor Davidson’s progress in
increasing the number of blacks and other minority members on
campus, and to recommend necessary changes.

Spencer told committee members that the record in recruiting
black faculty and staff members has been ‘“‘unimpressive ind
and that, despite determined efforts by the admissions office ahd
athletic recruiters, 15 years after the college opened its doors to
minority students the percentage of black students is still low.

“We cannot be satisfied with this showing,’’ Spencer said. ‘‘We
cannot be satisfied with anything less than a representative group
of black students, faculty and staff. The life of our campus must
reflect our commitment to the principle of equal rights and equal
treatment for all persons.”

Chairman of the new committee is Psychology Professor John
Kelton. Other members include Admissions Director John Griffith,
Head Football Coach Ed Farrell, Personnel Director Robert J.
Stephenson, Dean of Students Will Terry, French Professor
Charles Dockery, and Biology Professor Cindy Grant.

Student members are Alvin Atkinson, Ann Parker, Anita
Hutchings, and John Eley.
