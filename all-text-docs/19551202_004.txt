TRIBUTE TO

So it goes, through the day and
through the week. To each call

Tam and his wife Cecilia are the
proud parents of five children who
range in age from one to fourteen
years. The O’Connors live on Mock
Circle in Davidson. Tam is at pres-
ent the local secretary of the Chris-
tian Aid Society.

But Tam’s “students” know little
about the domestic environment of
their janitor. They know him as a
daily visitor who listens to their
gripes, discusses the latest campus

Creative Talent at D. C.

By JOHN HARMON

Vitality, vigor, vivaciousness, verve-these are the brilliant |

abstracts which the magic name of Davidson's oldest and most}

respected honorary fraternity, Sigma Upsilon, conjures in the}

astute and facile imaginations of those experienced in its
creatively stimulating traditions.

Clarifies Parking
(Continued From Page One)
able at Shearer Hall, the driveway
to Chambers beyond the Union, the
drive between the Stadium and Fra-
ternity Court, and in the Fraternity

Court parking area.

Reference has made to the num-
ber of restrictions listed on the
Parking Regulations placed in cars
and on bulletin boards several
weeks ago. The length of the list
resulted from an effort to provide
detailed information to car oper-
ators as to where they could and
could not park, particularly in view
of the fact that parking signs were

papers in the trash and mails off
the answers. But so far the judges
in Charlotte have never come up
with the right answers. Tam keeps
trying, but he’s not very optimis-
tic. “Can't nobody win that thing.
It’s fixed. That's what it is, it’s
fixed.”

Whether he’s winning or losing,
joking or griping, working or loaf-
ing, Tam is generally well-liked by
the boys who live on his beat.
“Yep,” one of them remarked re-
cently, “you gotta admit it. Tam’s
a damn good janitor.”

installed late.

Many of the restrictions are for
the protection of individuals driv-
ing cars or walking on the David-
son campus. For example, the spa-
ces on the East side of Belk did
not extend all the way to the drive
between Belk and the Laundry be-
cause a car parked there would re-
duce visibility to such an extent
that people or cars coming across
the drive would be endangered.

Parking of cars is prohibited on
curves such as the one at Duke
Dormitory and in other areas where
visibility and convenient operation
of cars would be adversely affected.
Some areas are restricted to pre-
vent cars from blocking the exit
of already parked cars. Some re-
strictions, like the 15 and 45 min-
ute parking areas at the Gym, the
Laundry, and the Union serve all
those who need a place to park for
only a short period of time.

While the parking situation at

Davidson is far from perfect it is}

considerably better than that exist-
ing in the vast majority of the col-
leges and universities in the coun-
try. You may be sure that the
policy of the College will be to
continue to provide the most satis-
factory facilities possible for cam-

pus parking.

Maj. Gen. Gard to Inspect
Davidson ROTC Unit

Major General Robert G. Gard will inspect the Davidson
College ROTC Unit on December 8, 1955. General Gard is
the Deputy Commanding General of the Third Army. He will
be accompanied by Lt. Col. R. T. Reed, and his aide, Lt.

N. J. Baird.

During the course of the inspec-
tion, General Gard will meet the
military personnel of the unit and
hear a briefing by the Cadet Regi-
mental Staff. Following the brief-
ing, he will have a conference with
the Senior Cadet Commanders and
the Regimental Staff, will observe
a class of instruetion, and will in-
spect the ROTC facilities. Imme-
diately before his departure he
will have a conference with Dr. C.
J. Pietenpol, Dean of Faculty.

General Gard was a 1918 grad-
uate of the United States Military
Academy at West Point. After at-
tending the Basic Course of the
Field Artillery School, he served as
a troop officer and Artillery in-
structor at several posts. During
World War Il he served in both
theaters, as an observer from the
Artillery school with the British

Eighth Army in Europe, and as
commander of the 96th Division
Artillery in the Pacific.

In 1951 he became commander
of the VII Corps Artillery of the
Seventh Army in Germany, and in
1952 he became Deputy Chief of
Staff for Operations, Headquarters
U. S. Army, Europe. Being pro
moted in 1953 to Major General,
he assumed the position of Deputy
Commander Third Army in October
1954, after 44 months of service
in Germany.

Among the decorations held by
General Gard are the Silver Star;
the Legion of Merit; the Victory
Medal World War I; American De-
fense; the European, African, Mid-
dle East Theater with one battle
star; and the American Theater, to

name only a few.

Although Sigma Upsilon has a
dazzling record of past achieve-
ment, it does not rest upon its
laurels: it remains today, as al-
ways, the most vibrant and influ-
ential honorary organization at
Davidson.

The year 1915 dates the genesis
of Davidson's Blue Pencil chapter.
After a petition from Davidson
was granted by the national or-
ganization, installment by the
Chapel Hill contingent followed
shortly.

As a functional organization, Sig-
ma Upsilon seeks to stimulate in-
terest in creative literary endeavor,
to recognize creative genius, and
to enable its members to enjoy
convivial intercourse. Its member-

ship, including both students and)
professors, is select, and is of the
type that makes a Sigma Upsilon

i not onl f |
—_ «AB ages gg 'a sophisticated, highly

creative communication but also
the ne plus ultra of social gather-
ings.

Among the more famous David-
son Sig Ups are such distinguished
persons as the novelist Vereen
Bell; Don Wharton, who writes for
Reader's Digest and other semi-
literate periodicals; Dr. S. R. Spen-
cer, author of Decision for War,
1917; and Dr. Chalmers Davidson,
regionally known for his historical
novels, the most controversial of
which, Cloud Over Catawba, is still
the subject of hot debate in lit-

erate circles

Sigma Upsilon formerly elected
as members only those who dis-
played marked creative ability;
| however, politics crept into its
/ranks and there is evidence that
|collusive influence has been ex-
|erted more than once for the pur-
| pose of electing friends to mem-
| bership. The present membership
lis not, strictly speaking, totally
jcreative, though it is wholly literary
and intellectual. It is amazing that |
| despite its wide diversity of in-
| terests, the membership maintains
| perfect harmony in its meetings, |
| which usually last around three!
hours. Every second is utilized,
however, and gems of rhetoric and |
wisdom are as common as_ IQ's
above 140, |

Sigma Upsilon is not, as is some-
times supposed, a cathartic haven
for naive neuroties. It is, rather,
literate
coterie that provides creative stim-
ulus and that appreciates “and)
judges the results of literary |
creativity. It confers upon its elite
the type of implicit honor and
abiding respect which many covet
but few attain. To speak in the
vernacular, it is the most.
