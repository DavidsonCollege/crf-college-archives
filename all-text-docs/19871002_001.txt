| Rumors around Davidson
lately have it that the local Food
jon grocery store is going to
lose soon. How much truth can
be attributed to these rumors?
ell for right now, no one, even
e people at the Food Lion, can
be exactly sure what will happen

n the next few weeks.

Chuck Kyles, manager of the
Davidson Food Lion, said that
ere was a “good, strong possi-
bility” that the store would be
losing soon. But he was quick to
emphasize that it was only a possi-
bility. He also said that if the store
loses it would be on Noveanber 1.
“I’m just guessing when I say
at we might be closing soon,”
yles said. “They (Food Lion
nanagement) don’t tell us any-
ing like that until the last mi-
ute.” (Food Lion officials did not
eturn calls made by the Davidso-
ian.)

The sixth anniversary of the
‘freshman international awareness .
test has once again resulted in a
higher class average than the pre-
vious year. Professor Hansford
Epes, who is in charge of modify-
ing the test each year, reported
that the average of all the scores
on this year’s test had risen 2.5%
over last year’s scores, which had
_—been 1% higher than the previous_

An informed Davidson com-
munity source said, however, that
the store would definitely close
very soon and that it would start
moving employees by the end of
October.

The Food Lion in Davidson
has been open for five years and
was preceeded by a Lowes groc-
ery store. According to Kyles, the
Lowes store was not able to sur-
vive either. Kyles also said that
the main problem conceming the
Food Lion is that many people
have the misconception that the
store does not stock a wide variety
of products.

“A lot of people have the im-
pression that Food Lion isn’t a full
market store,” Kyles said. “We
are large enough,” he continued,
“but we just don’t do enough vol-
ume to generate the income we
need to stay in business.”

An important question that
many are asking around Davidson

is what will replace the Food Lion
The
shopping center in which the Food
Lion is located is owned by the
Four Seasons Developing Com-
pany, which in turn is managed by
Shamrock Management located in

Charlotte.

Abraham Luski, an official at
Shamrock Management, said that.
his firm had not received any
notification that Food Lion will be
leaving the shopping center. “I
can’t make a prediction about who
could be moving in since we have
not heard any official news from
Food Lion as a company,” Luski

said.

-The only other alternative was
to try to find some answers
through the Food Lion manage-
ment in Salisbury. The main prob-

lem, however, was that no one

who could discuss the matter was

ever in his office or took the time

to return any phone calls.

Rusk program
misses goal

By JON BOLES
After starting up the 1987-88

Alumni campaigns in Atlanta
and Texas have assembled almost

school year with the appearance of one million dollars, to which the
guest speaker Lord Max Beloff Duke Endowment has added a

the Dean Rusk Program in Inter-
national Studies is changing

an course to enable it to increase fun-

draising efforts.

“We've tried very hard to
build an excellent program,” com-
mented director Jack Perry, “and
after making the initial splash, we
now want to solidify.” Of the ten
million dollars originally pro-
jected for the endowment of the
program, only three million have
been raised to date, and one major
problem, according to Dr. Pesry,

is that “we have, with a few nota-
ble exceptions, not attracted a
large inflow of donations over the
last two years.”

The program is completely in-
dependent in its fundraising . “The
initial conception was that we
would not be a drain on the college
budget, but rather raise money as
we go along.” -

Funding thus far has come in
from three major sources: alumni
gifts, the Duke Endowment, and
corporate sponsorships.

professorship in international
studies.

In addition, several corpora-
tions have donated generous
amounts earmarked for specific
aspects of the program, among
them NCNB, which has given
$250,000 to establish a fund spe-
cifically for an annual conference;
the Ford Motor Corporation,
whose $100,000 grant is used to
bring in speakers, and AT&T,
which has provided the money to
bring in both Arkady Shevchenko
and Col. Fred Cherry, author of
Bloods, in the past two years.

This year fewer speakers wil!
be coming to campus, and many
of those who do will be concen-
trating on the theme ofthe confer-
ence on world hunger planned for
this spring.

Another change in the pro-
gram’s activities on campus is the
move to coordinate efforts with
other groups such as the open
lunch committee, which will co-
sponsor speaker Thomas Greene
on the 14th of October.

In the past two years, the pro-
grain has brought literally scores
of speakers to campus, including
authors, diplomats, scholars and
businessmen, as well as organiz-
ing teach-ins, sponsoring an inter-
national opportunities night, and
hosting annual conferences for the
expressed purpose of giving “each
student, first, an informed aware-
ness of our whole planet, and sec-
ond, direct knowledge of at least _
one foreign area.”

may be the result of differing read-
ing behaviors among high school

students but at the same time illus-

peared in the college years.

Freshman input on the test has
been limited, partly due to the fact
that freshmen have not recieved
their scorés yet. But one freshman
who spoke with Epes said he

-- thought the test was very easy.
