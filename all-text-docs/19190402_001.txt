GLEE CLUB AWAY
ON SECOND TRI

The Glee Club trip two weeks ago
was such a success that it seemed a
shame to let talent of so excellent a qual-
ity zo to waste. For this reason two en-
gagements were made, one Monday
night at Mitchell College, Statesville.
N.C., and the other at Lenoir College.
Hickory, N. C.. for Tuesday night.

‘Those making the trip were: H. B.
Brown, €. R. Vanee. PL A. Freeman,
H. B. Dendy. C. J. Matthews, E. H.
Denny, J. J. Love, AJ D. MecArn, B.
KE. Shields. J. W. Phillips, G. 0. Sam-
ple, D. P. MeGeachy, M.A. “Fremain,

On to Blue Ridge!
Great Opportunity

Make Plans Now to Attend Conference
In June.

Yes. vou are right about it! “The
Blue Ridge Conference will be held this
summer, and Davidson expects to have
a good-sized delegation there. Some one
has said thar the success of the work the
next year at any college depends to a
large extent upon the delegation at Blue
Ridge.

Blue Ridge is an ideal place for a
conierence. Located in the heart of the
Blue Ridge Mountains: it is surrounded
hy many tall and beautiful peaks. Mount
Mitchell, which has the highest cleva-
tion cast at the Rockies, is visible from
the place. Ut is about twenty five miles
distant from Blue Ridge, and frequently
tramping parties climb it.

But speaking at the conference, it is

the unanimenus epinion of all who ge
that. it is one of the great ten days of
their lives,
» Prominent men of all sections of the
coyntry are there to speak and teach.
The list of speakers this year is not yet
obtainable, but it'is assured that it will
contain men of the type of Robert EF.
Speer. Dr. Horne of New York, Dr.
Weatherford, Dr. Mims of Vanderbilt.
Dr. E. M. Potent, and many others,

Athletics are nat neglected. so don’t
forget ta take your gloves, raquets and
athletic equipment with you. “The boys
one mets there are of a thpe that it dues
ene good to know. = It is well. nigh im-
possible for a student to go to a Blue
Ridge conference and not receive some
real benefit. Think it over and while
you are making your plans for the sum-
mer, don't ferget to include the Blue
Ridye conference. You will never, never
regret going.

Winner

Of Tennis “D”

Woods Runner-up. All Matches Close
and Interesting.

By defeating E. A. Woods in the final
match Saturday afternoon, W. FL Halt
settled the question of tennis champion
and at the same time brought new honors
to the renowned "Flalls of Fame.” “Uhe
whole tournament was unusually snappy
and every round brought out some close
contested matches. A’ signifi
was the fact that almost one-halt of the
entries were Freshmen, some of whom
will be conspicuous in the championship
fight next year,

The match between MeKeldin and
Hall inthe third round and between
Hall and Spence in the semi-finals were
especially close, In the tormer match
both sets required extra games for a
decision. Jn the last set MeKeldin was
in the lead and tor a while it seemed
that the set belonged to him, until Frank
settled down and finished it ap ins his
faver, In the match with Spence, Hell
was tarced to play his best. “Vhe fact
that these two old partners had played
doubles topethey for three years seemed
to increase their rivalry and the match
was played in jam-up style.

In the finals Woods staged a sensa-
tional comeback: after losing the first
two sets he took the nest by.a G-1 count
‘and the fourth by a O-ysctore How.
ever, at this taae Hall called for a tooth
pick, and this mysterious want was al
once supplied by the audience, It was
demonstrated that the usetulness af this
lusary has been extended bevond ite
original scope and that it can be succes
fully emploved as a nerve pacifier, tor
Frank at ance regained his stride and
walked off with the final set. Woods
plaved his usual steady game throughout,
at no time showing signs of uneasiness.
However, Hall's dificult serve and bard
smashing were a finde too effective. and
when accurate could hardly be — coped
with. According to a recent ruling of
the Athletic Association, Frank will be
awarded a-teanis “D." and is ta be con:
gratitated on being the first to receive
this honor.
