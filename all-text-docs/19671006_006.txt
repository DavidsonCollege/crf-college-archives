High Academic Rating

‘Davidson has had no
drop in the quality of its ap-
plicants,’’ according to J. W.
Regen.

Regen, assistant director
of admissions, said, “For in-
stance, this year’s Fresh-
man Class has nine National

Merit Scholarship winners.
50 Finalists, and 55 recipi-
ents of letters of Commenda-
tion.”’

Regen’s comments came
in respanse to questions
sparked by a recent article

The article said that many
private colleges are facing a
shortage’ of qualified appli-
cants due to increasel en-
roilment in state universi-
ties and junior ‘colleges and
an increase in competition
between private schools.

Regen based his answer
on the profiles of admissions
data for the past several
years. For instance, for the
Class of 1970 there were 1114
completed applications. Com-
pleted applications are those
on which a final decision has
been made.

Out of this number, David-
son accepted 451 or 41 per
cent, including those who
were placed on the waiting
list.

then ashed those students to

the questions and then pre-

He also made a precogni-

with the serial number of a

discussed ESP and other
psychics. He believes that
“ESP is highly limited.’’ and
he disagrees with some cli-
nical psychologists who feel
that ESP will be harnassed
to prevent war and crime.

However, Burgess feels
that ESP is innate and that
everyone has it to some de-
gree. But a person can im-
prove his ESP only with
practice and only if he has
the potential.

Because of this the Admis-

He further pointed out
that Davidson's competition

Fee Hike Merits

The social fee was increased this year from
$30 to $40 so that the Social Council would have
more funds for booking entertainment.

In response to the question “Do you feel the
$10 increase in the social fee was justified in light
of the entertainment scheduled for this year?”

Bill Olson, junior: ‘The caliber of
the entertainment does not justify the
increase. I don’t think the entertain-
ment is as contemporary or as well
known as in the past. The Platters
are not of my generation. However,
knowing that the Union runs at a loss
every year, the increase was needed." ¢

ritual and voting.

This arrangement may con-
tinue longer than two months
if both the fraternity and the
rushee desire it. If this is not
mutually agreeable then the
rushee is to be issued another
invitation and may continue
in this manner until receiving
a bid.

Receipt of a bid automati-
cally terminates a rushee's
participating in the formal
rush program whether or not
he accepts it.

A further addition to the
new proposal is a tudicial
board which would allow a
fraternity to request the re-
moval of any rushee whose
behavior is objectionable to
the fraternity.

The immediate cause of the
New proposal was a resolu-
tion of the national fraterni-
ties received several weeks
ago in which they voiced their

objections to the previous

United Appealers
To Storm Dorms
In Annual Drive

The Davidson United Appeal will kick off its an-
nual student fund drive Monday night.

Campus chairman Jim Terry expressed hope for
a repeat of last year’s drive in which students and
faculty gave $7,500, Surpassing the established goal

by 200 per cent.

Terry, assistant dean of students, has asked senior
Bob Howard, who headed last year’s student collection,

to assume the same posi-
tion this year. In addition,
he has appointed five
professors to serve as
team captains. These five
are Drs. Samuel Maloney,
Anthony Abbott, Tom
Daggy, L. R. King and W.
G. Workman.

Unlike other drives on
campus, the United Appeal al-
lows students to contribute
in either of two methods.
Students may pay the stu-
dent collector when he solicits
or may make a pledge and
request billing at various
times during the school year.

Terry pointed Out that the
United Appeal. as a single
agency, serves 43 different
organizations. He said that
this enabled students to con-
tribute to one drive, but help
a large number of causes.

Thursday Chapel
Features Movies

In a program that depart.
ed from the usual chapel,
the student body Thursday
saw two abstract films.

The first. an animated
color short entitled ‘‘Alf.
Bill and Fred,"* dealt in a
comical way with the evils
of money. The second, and
longer. film was ‘The Hang-
man,.”' a color fantasy in-
spired by Maurice Ogden's
poem of the same name.

Dance
Weekend
Plans Set

Student sign-up for dates’
rooms for Homecoming and
the procedures for moving
out of Belk and Richardson
dormitories will be the same
as last year. with one slight
change.

The change will involve
the use of bed linens for the
the weekend. Mrs. Peter
Nicholls, supervisor of stu-
dent housing, asked that stu-
dents living in Belk and
Richardson remove college-

owned linens from their
beds.
Mrs. Nicholls suggested

that these students eithers
take their linens with them
when they move to other
dorms or put them in their
closets.

Janitors will make up beds
in Belk and Richardson with —
clean linens for the weekend.
These linens will be removed
on Sunday.

Sign-up for rooms will fol-
low the same procedures
used in the past and Belk
Richardson residents may
sign for spaces on Monday.
On Tuesday residents of
other dormitories may _ re-
serve spaces. On Wednes-
day, space may be reserved
in the dorms for guests.
