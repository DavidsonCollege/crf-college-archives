By John Whitcomb

Southern

Coming into the game versus Conference
Louisville, the Davidson women’s
soccer team was 3-9-1 and looking Preseason
for a win to bolster their season Basketball Polls
record. Facing a tough Louisville
squad did not seem like the way to Men

get a-win. However, the Wildcats
played tight defense the entire game
and defeated the Cardinals 1-0.
Early in the first half, Claudia
Lombard put a shot past the Louis-
ville keeper for her eighth goal of
the season, and the Wildcats took a
1-Olead. Inthe second half, though,
the Wildcats really turned it on.
Instead of playing conservative
with the lead, they aggressively
sought and obtained many more
scoring opportunities. Kelly
Amman played well despite land-
ing on her head after crashing into
the Louisville goalkeeper early in
the second half. Both Amman and
Lombard had some excellent scor-

fourth in the last for a total of six
points. Clemson scored a first,

fourth and final spot at the champi-
onships.

At Eckerd in St. Petersburg,
Florida, the four North teams will
race against the top four teams
from the South Division: Eckerd,
Florida, Rollins, and South Florida.

The Davidson Rugby Club
came out on top in two rugby con-
tests against Appalachian State on
Saturday. Davidson played the
first half with a great deal of inten-
sity, with forwards. Chris Smith,
Mike Ingram, and Mike Kessler
bulldozing the opposing scrum to
set the pace.

The tough play of the forwards
got the ball into the hands of scrum

’ half David Derrick, who managed

to distribute the ball to the backs
under high pressure from the
Mountaineers.

Controversy erupted when
Pete Scholze took a pass, ran di-
agonally for the corner of the tri-
zone, and beat several ASU play-
ers for an apparent score. The
linesman, who may not have told
the truth, called Scholze: out of
bounds and disallowed the tri. Play
had to be stopped minutes later
when an Appalachian player suf-
fered a compound fracture, stop-
ping play for 30 minutes.

Rugby wins wild
contest behind Ackerman

In the second half, Tom

Shelburne came out hitting hard

and intimidated the opposing side
with tough defense. Davidson
maintained strong possession, and
pushed upfield with experienced
Simon Priestley’s accurate kick-
ing. Despite tough play across the
board, Davidson did not manage to
score by the end of regulation.

Just minutes into sudden death
overtime, however, freshman Hank
Ackerman took a pass from Frank
Killian and surged 20 yards into
the tri-zone.

Ackerman’s game-winning
run was aclimactic finish to along,
hard fought match.

Davidson dominated the sec-
ond game, winning off of a penalty
kick courtesy of Simon Priestley.
Brian Blythe played well in the
scrum and Scott Burkhardt’s run-
ning was key in the backfield.
Strong defense shut out Appala-
chian State once again, rendering
them scoreless and winless for the
day.
