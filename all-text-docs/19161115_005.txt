and that’s where the rub comes in.
THE STARS OF THE GAME
Davidson played offensive ball for al-
most the entire game, as the account of
the game shows, and rarely did the backs
fail to gain.

credit cannot be given them.

“Buck” Burns amply justified his so-
briquet. He rammed and bucked that
“impregnable” Carolina line for some-
thing like 60 yards while he was in the
game, and besides that played a great

defensive game. He never failed to gain] f'

Bob Walker played a great game at

Although often pushed by Carolina’s
ends, he never failed to get off his punts
for good distances.

The back-field played a great game to
be sure, but their playing was equalled
