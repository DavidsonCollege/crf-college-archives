Week in Washington
Congress approves line-item veto

By Davib SANTSCHI
Washington Week Correspondent

Working feverishly before a
two-week recess that began Satur-
day, the House on Thursday ap-
proved a form of the line-item veto
by a 232-177 vote. Because the
Senate already passed the bill, it
will be sent promptly to President
Clinton, who is certain to sign it.

With the line-item veto, the
president could accept or reject
individual line items in spending
bills approved by Congress. After
the president submits a list of his
cuts to Congress, both houses could
accept all or part of the cuts. The
cuts that are accepted would take
effect immediately. The cuts that
are not accepted would be sent
back to the president in the form of
a bill of disagreement. The presi-
dent would then veto this bill; only
if two-thirds of both chambers
voted to override the presidential
veto would it become law.

This process is called “en-
hanced rescission” because the
president could not remove items
without *recourse through. Con-
gress. Opponents of the line-item

veto, most notably Sen. Robert
Byrd (D-WV), believe that “the
power of the purse is the central
pillar upon which the constitutional
temple of checks and balances rests,
and if that pillar crumbles, ‘the
temple will fall.”

Despite its convoluted proce-
dure, the line-item veto raises seri-
ous constitutional questions. It
would result in a substantial trans-
fer of power from the legislative to

the executive branch. The presi-

dent would have some discretion
over individual spending projects,
which Congress now enjoys ex-
clusively. Even if the line-item
veto is signed into law by the presi-
dent, it is almost certain to face a
Supreme Court challenge within
two years after its enactment.

President Clinton supports the
line-item veto, which he believes
would “ensure that our public re-
sources are put to the best possible
uses.”

Supporters of the measure ar-

gue that wasteful spending, often
attached to other non-related bills,
would decrease substantially if the
president had more fiscal author-

ity.

After President Clinton signs
the bill into law, the line-item veto
would not take effect until after
January 1, 1997, after the presi-
dential election is over. This stipu-

lation resulted from negotiations .

between Clinton and his Republi-
can rival for the presidency, Sen.
Bob Dole (R-KS). Neither side
claimed to want to use the issue as
a political weapon in the fall elec-
tion campaign.

The passage of the line-item
veto signals the opening of a hectic
legislative season before the presi-
dential campaign begins in ear-
nest.

Both candidates will be deli-
cately maneuvering to claim credit
for enacted legislation and use
stalled issues as political weapons.

With a divided government
and leaders of two branches run-

ning against each other, passage of ©

substantial legislation seems un-
likely.

The spirit of compromise that
produced the line-item veto will
probably disappear as intense cam-
paigning begins and divisive is-
sues emerge that can be exploited
for political gain. —

Global Perspective

Back to the U.S.S.R?

Elections threaten return to communist system

By Eric CoL.incs

On March 15, the Duma of the
Russian Federation passed a non-
binding resolution which declared
the Belavezha Accords dissolving
the Soviet Union unconstitutional.
This action, spearheaded by the
Communist Party faction, essen-
tially insinuated that the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics contin-
ues to exist. Leaders from the
majority of the former Soviet re-
publics, especially the Baltic and
Trancaucasian states, immediately
denounced the resolution as ille-
gitimate, unwise, and a threat to
stability. —

Western diplomats such as
Secretary of State Warren Christo-
pher also voiced their disapproval.
Despite these statements and the
worldwide attention which the
Duma announcement generated, it
is likely that the domestic spinoffs
will far outweigh the international
implications.

The Russian presidential elec-
tion will occur on June 16, 1996.
The beleaguered incumbent, Presi-
dent Boris Yeltsin, currently trails
the Communist candidate Gennadi
Zyuganov by roughly ten percent
in most polls. The Communists,
who parlayed widespread dissatis-
faction with living conditions and
the bloody civil war in Chechnya
into resounding results in the De-
cember, 1995, parliamentary elec-
tions, forced President Yeltsin to
dismiss most of the reformers in
his cabinet and make outrageous
promises about social services to
the citizenry. Divisions
within the democratic frontas both

Yegor Gaidar and Grigorii
Yavlinsky refuse to withdraw in

. support of Yeltsin contrast sharply

with the willingness of hard-liners
suchas Viktor Anpilov, Aleksandr
Rutskoi, and Aman Tuleev to sub-
ordinate their interests to that of
Mr. Zyuganov and the Communist
Party.

Add in Vladimir Zhirinovsky,
the ultra-nationalist leader, and
retired General Aleksandr Lebed,
and many experts predict that Presi-
dent Yeltsin will struggle to reach
the run-off election which will oc-
cur if, as is likely, no candidate
receives fifty percent of the vote in
the first round. °

However, the recent Duma
resolution should help President
Yeltsin, already closing the gap
separating him from Mr. Zyuganov
inthe latest polls. President Yeltsin
immediately denounced the reso-
lution and requested that the Fed-
eration Council (upper house of
the parliament) investigate the pro-
ceedings. Furthermore, he can
portray this particular incident as
indicative of the policy course
which the Communists would pur-
sue if they come to power.

While the majority of Russian
citizens may express nostalgia for
the days of the Soviet Union, most
realize that a return to the past is
simply not possible given the path
down which Russia has travelled.
They do value improved relations
with the other republics, however.

Therefore, in the weeks fol-
lowing the Duma declaration,
President Yeltsin announced an
agreement with Belarus creating a
“union of deep integration.” The
Central Asian nations of Kazakstan

and Kirghizia also initialed accords
strengthening economic ties with
the Russian Federation.. He essen-.
tially coopted the Communist po-
sition, but in a milder, less strident
fashion.

Mr. Zyuganov quickly real-
ized the political advantage gained
by President Yeltsin and back-
tracked to’insist that he opposed
the timing of the Duma resolution,
preferring to wait until after the
presidential elections. Other Com-
munist. leaders, however,
emboldened by the reaction elic-
ited in the international commu-
nity, vowed to press forward with:
other measures such as a constitu-
tional amendment abolishing the
institution of the presidency.

Perhaps the Communist Party
is not monolithic after all. With
less than three months until the
presidential election, the result
appears to hinge upon which can-
didate presents an united front
come June 16th.

Members of this subcommit-
tee, in turn, have formed commit-
tees of their own: to get student
input on the issue. Buford has
formed a SGA Ad-Hoc Commit-
tee on the Alcohol Policy, while
Hamlin has met with a “small task
force” of Union Board members.
The PCC has also discussed this
issue at length.

However, the general popu-
lace of Davidson still feels con-
fused about the details of the argu-
ment.

The basic facts are:

¢ The self study has recom-
mended that the school eliminate
kegs. The trustees have the ulti-
mate say at their April 19th meet-
ing. i
¢ The committees have been
formed to represent the student
voice and are now debating whether
to recommend this keg ban to the
CCRL, as well as what options the
school has in the advent of a keg
ban.

e The keg ban is based on

| liability issues. Insurance for eat-

ing houses has increased dramati-
cally in the last few years, and
fraternities have been constantly
reviewed by their national chap-
ters. So far, Davidson has been
virtually accident—free, but should
an accident happen a lawsuit could
fall on individual officers. The
actual purchase of alcohol by the
fraternities and eating houses
makes them liable.

¢ Committee members have
played with many different op-
tions for a new alcohol policy.
Cans, tents in the middle of the
court, a third party (not associated
with the school or the Court) ven-
dor, andaregulated amount bought

by each house member have all _

been discussed in meetings.

Committee members have
been in contact with several differ-
ent schools around the nation gath-
ering information. -

Many students, however, feel —

that their voice is not being heard.
Senior Peter Varney, a member of
CCRL, says, “I think that a lot of
students are feeling very defeatist
about the whole thing- they are
resigned to the fact that kegs are
going to go, and a little bit con-
cerned that they are limited in their
influence about what their options
are.”

Many worry that the new al-
cohol policy will lead to closed
parties and a smaller court. Others
voice concern that students will
drink off-campus: leading to a
higher rate of drunk driving and
problems with the surrounding
community.

Subcommittee member
SaraBeth Hamlin says they are
making sure that Court interests
are being kept in mind: “We want
to have open parties without limit-
ing who comes in, and we want to
avoid drunk driving.”

After the PCC meeting Sun-
day night, in which Court leaders

‘met with Court Advisors, some

members felt discontent and de-
feat. Sigma Phi Epsilon President
Rix Threadgill says, “I feel like we
talk a lot but don’t get anything
done - it's [not in our hands].”

Pi Kappa Alpha President
Dave Farrar is also frustrated. “I
feel like all of our committees are
for nothing.”

PCC president John Cowan
says, “nothing definite came out of
the meeting.”

Bell was unavailable for com-
ment.

Buford has confidence that the
student voice will be heard by the
trustees. “I think it would be dis-
turbing if the committees were for
nothing. I’m trying to do what I

‘can to ensure more student repre-

sentation ... I can guarantee that
the student voice will be heard at
all levels. That’s my obligation. If
there is one thing lam disappointed
in it is the lack of information to
the student body about the issue.’

Students who have strong
opinions about the issue can voice
their comments at an open forum
on Tuesday in Chambers sot
at 7 p.m.
