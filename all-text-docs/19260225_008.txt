THE DAVIDSONIAN, FEBRUARY 25, 1926

Members of Senior

Class Hold Smoker

The Senior class had a very enjoyable
get-together meeting and smoker at the
Maxwell Chambers Hotel Tuesday night
at eight o'clock.

Roland Parker, president of the class
of '26, was toastmaster. Professor A.
Currie gave a very entertaining and in-
structive talk. His talk was featured
with a number of anecdotes which were
greeted with much applause. As a part
of the entertainment the Glee Club quar-
tet, composed of Bradley, Calhoun, Fos-
ter and Wilson, gave a number of their
popular songs, which they will use on
their Southern tour. E. T. Pullen and
liged Smith gave short talks. At ap-
propriate times duringthe program the
Glee Club Orchestra, lead by “Tootie”
Crayton, rendered a number of selections
and did much to enliven the program.

After the talks and music the class
settled down to a more serious discus-
sion of business. Various plans for the
future were made and passed upon. The
committee which has been investigating

the feasibility of recording “Old David- |

son” gave a very favorable report. The
Senior class this year has been the first
to ever consider this matter and. they
seem to be making arrangements that in
time will materialize.

During the rendition of the program
the Seniors were served oranges, apples,
peanuts and cold drinks. Cigars and sig-
arettes were frequently passed around
the tables.

Much of the success of the smoker is
due to the plans and work of a commit-
tee headed by E. K. Regen, who was as-
sisted by L. L. Deck and W. E. Milton,
Claytor, Eddington and Ragan.

When the business meeting was closed
the entire class joined with the Glee Club
Quartet and the Orchestra
“College Ties.”

Everyone present had
a most enjoyable evening and the success
of the smoker has been acclaimed by all

to Attract Many Boys

Advanced Course Students to Spend
Summer Months in Military
Centers

Now that Old Man Groundhog has com-
mitted an error and approaching Spring
is making its proximity felt the young
‘men ofthe country, and especially the
college men, are trying to decide where
their vacation will be spent. One answer
to this question is the C. M. T. C., or, to
be exact, the Civilian Military Training
Camp, where the work is hard, athletic
events are plentiful, and where a man has
instilled in him those principles of initia-
tive and leadership that develop him into
a real “he-man.”

At the C. M. T. C, the trainee becomes
a member of a big team in which each
man has to play his individual part.. He
acquires just as good a coat of tan as he
would at the most popular summer
beach resort, his muscles harden as
quickly and as well as they would in a
gymnasium, he learns to control himself
and others, and his vision is broadened
from the personal contact with young
men from other sections ofthe country.
Most attractive of all, ghis expenses are

‘paid and he draws additional pay for do-
ing a patriotic duty.

This year the trainees from North Car-
olina will be sent Fort Bragg, near
Fayetteville, N.C. In other states men
will be sent tothe following training cen-
ters nearest their homes: Camp McClel-
lan, Alabama; Fort Barrancas, Florida;
Fort Oglethorpe, Ga. While requests for
military training are ordinarily in ex-
cess ofthe number that can-be accepted

}the military authorities have announced
that it can be safely stated that appli-
cants living with a radius of 220 miles of

camp.

This Fort Bragg can accommo-
date 800 trainees, Camp McClellan 1,550,
Fort Barraneas 450, and Fort Oglethorpe
700, a total of but 3,500 from this corps
area. As priority in making application
will necessarily have weight in the mat-
‘ter of acceptance fortraining it is pre-
dicted that most applications will be re-
ceived during the early part of March.

With the exception of Fort Bragg the
period of training will begin July oth and
‘end August 7th. At this post the period
is July 2nd-July gist. ;

At Davidson the officers who have been
designated to handle the matter of ap-

They call it “Junior Dance” at other
schools, but at Davidson it’s plain “Junior
Speaking.” eee

N. C. C. W. has been hard-hit by the
mid-year exams. Seventy-one students,
fifty-four of whom were freshmen, were
forced to leave college as a result of this
terrorizing epidemic.

Spring football has begun at Citadel.
Instead of two weeks’ training this year,
as has previously been the custom, they
will have four, Those taking part in this
carly practice will be equally divided at
the end of the season for a match game.

Judging from an editorial in the Tiger
Clemson has been having trouble with
her heating system, and especially that
part of the system which determines
whether their Saturday night showers
shall be cold or hot. One boy cut a class
with the hope of getting ahead of the
crowd and receiving some benefit from
his promptness, but to his great conster-
nation he found the water at its natural
temperature.

The faculty of Birmingham-Southern
seem to have profited by the recent rul-
ing of the faculty at Davidson in regard
to absences incurred immediately before
and after a holiday. They have adopted
a new system of regulations among
which is that famous rule that, “All ab-
sences immediately before and after a
holiday will be counted double.”

They say that there are still a few col-
lege boys that are so old-fashioned that
they still wear garters. Honestly—don't
mention it, but I’ve heard that there are
at least three of these abnormal creatures
right here on our own campus. Well—
that proves that college boys are much
like baseball players—we always have
some hold-outs. It may be, however
that these freaks of nature have not be-
come well enough accustomed to modern
means of living to fully appreciate the
true. value of them. There are many ad-
vantages in the non-use of garters: first,

_the time devoted to fastening of them

could be utilized for a greater good—
such as improving that part of the body
which is exposed to public inspection.
You see garters don't show any way
(applies to boys only) so what’s the use
of wearing them—spend the time in man-
ufacturing of stacombing.

Then, a pair of hose that sags can
easily hide a hole in the heel of a sock’
that could otherwise be seen. These old
fashioned fellows have. to take a stich in|

moderns just let 'em sag, thus, hiding the |
holes. Yes, I'll agree that the adage}

The present Soph class at Meredith
College can boast of having turned radi-
cal by breaking the age-worn custom of |
having their numerals painted on the |

college tank by Sophomores from N. C.
State. Instead, a bunch of their Wake
Forest admirers came over under cover
of darkness and artistically placed a gold
and black '28 on the tank. The State
lads, feeling somewhat offended, rather
than have their “goat gotten” proceeded
to smear a coat of black paint over-the
entire work of art. Imagine their sur-
prise upon awakening the next morning
to again find conspiciously shining forth,
a ’28, together with a W. F. C. and an
M. each in its respective color.

A new novel, “A Call to Arms” was, of
course, written by a woman.
