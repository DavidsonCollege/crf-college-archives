“ey” Change Combines Spring And
Fall Special Religious Services

Plans, marking a major change
in YMCA policy, are now well
underway for the holding of a
comprehensive “Religious Em-
phasis Week” on the Davidson
campus in February, 1955. This
will replace the annual fall and
spring services which have been
held here for a number of years.

This program is being planned
and carried out under close co-
operation with the University
Christian Mission, a national or-
ganization formed for this pur-
pose.

The organizational arrangement
suggested by the University Chris-
tian Mission is being used at Da-
vidson. This calls for the selection
of a Campus Committee from which
an Executive Committee is elected.
The Executive Committee in turn
appoints the various other com-
mittees, the chairmen of which
make up the Program Committee.

Officers Elected

At a meeting of the Campus
Committee held late last week,
this organizational setup was put

By TOM WARLICK

into motion. The main item of
business was the election of the
Executive Committee. Dr. John
R. Cunningham was elected honor-
ary chairman of this committee by
acclamation.

The other officers elected were
as follows: chairman, Prof. Iain
Wilson; vice chairmen, Cortez
Cooper and Jason McManus; and
secretary, Corky King. Sam Magill,
YMCA secretary, ise serving as
executive secretary of this com-
mittee. ;

The meeting also featured a re-
corded address by Dr. James L.
Stoner, Director of the University
Christian Mission. Dr. Stoner out-
lined in his speech the aspects of
an ideal religious emphasis week
which were also the aims and
ideals of the YMCA for this pro-
gram: 1) a period of true worship;
2) continuing value; 3) good or-
ganization; 4) student body study
in preparation for the program;
5) a process, not a schedule of
events; 6) a vital program; and,
7) good speakers.

The meeting was closed with the
announcement of a visit to the Da-
vidson campus by Dr. Stoner on
April 27 and 28.

xecutive Committee Meets

On Monday evening, March 29,
the executive committee held its
first meeting. The only item of
business taken up was the selec-
tion of the various committee
chairmen. These committee chair-
men along with the members of
the executive committee form the
program committee for the serv-
ices.

Those selected to head their va-
rious committees are as follows:
arrangements, Ronnie Wilson; book
display, Fred Myers; breakfast and
retreat, Clyde Robinson; class
rooms, Roy Davis; continuation,
Henry Brockmann; finance, Hugh
Gramley; hospitality, Archie Joy-
ner; organized house committee,
Perrin Anderson; personal confer-
