THE

DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 24, 1924

Southern Lassies |

Ornament Campus |
With Their Beauty

The girls that encompassed the historic
campus of Davidson the past week far
eclipsed any such gathering that has ever
before graced her green lawns. The number
is said to be larger than ever before and it
is known for a certainty that in looks and
manners they -have never been surpassed.
From the far corners of the Southland they
came, and were not disappointed at what they |
saw and heard, |

The following are the names of the vis-

J. M. Selser, Moultrie, Ga. has been
chosen as business manager of the Glee Club.
It was the decision of the club that the

business manager should not be connected
with the organization in any other capacity,
but that he should give his entire attention
to his managerial duties. This is Johnnie's
first affiliation with the club,

hoping that she would recover, but in a few
moments George returns to take up again
the persurance of his question, As he is
about to come to his point again, the second
interruption occurs from the same source.

outstretched arms accepts him.
