Sophs Win Contest
In Class Base Ball

Freshmen Get Second Place---Sen-
iors Third---Juniors Last.

The annual class base ball games were
scheduled last week, advantage being
taken of the Varsity's trip through South
Carolina. ‘fhe diamond was in excel-
lent condition and good ball was played.

In the first game, Tuesday, the 13th,

the Sophs were victorjous over the Jun-|

iors by the score of 14-5. Batteries for
Sophs were McNair and ‘Thames, while
for the Juniors, Pair and McIntyre did
the “honors.”

‘Wednesday. in the game between Sen-
iors and Fresh, real ball was played, ‘Vhe
Fowle Brothers held sway as the Fresh-
men battery. while McDonald and
Boggs opposed them tor the Seniors.
The Fresh started off with two runs in
the first inning. “Bill” Bailey crossed |
the plate for thé Seniors, “Vhe Fresh- ;
men showed the Seniors all through the
game that they were masters of the situ-
ation, and their older and more experi
enced brethren tried in vain toe outplay

them. Russell Minter was ‘hit by the!

pitcher in the ninth and was glad tojthe college
walk. ‘The Fresh claimed the victors

by 9-7.

The third game was played Thursday,
the i§th. “Phe Fresh were again vic-
torious, this fime. aver the Juniurs ba
5-3. Jamie” and “Sam” were again in
evidence, as were Pair and Nclityre.
Evans and Sprunt “starred” for — the
Fresh, while Hill) and Adams plaved
good ball for the Juniors.

In the Friday game. April 16. the Se.
iors met the Sophs. ‘This was by tai
the most interesting game. “Phe Sopha
mores took the lead at the start. Craww-
ford and Thames composing their bat-
tery, did good work. “The Seniors, with
McDonald and Boggs doing the battery
work, woke up in the third and began
the old-time stuff of “three up, three
down.” ‘The game would have probably
been an overwhelming Sephomore vic-
tory had not Capt. M. J. Shirley seen
fit to put “Jimmie” Van Devanter and
“Coach” Johnson in as pinch — hitters,
who somewhat rallied the whole team
and by their experienced hitting and
fielding caused the final score to read
15-t4 in the Sophs’ favor. This result
gave the Sophomores even chances with
the Fresh, each team having won two
games, while the Juniors and Seniors
had each lost two. Things certainly
evened up and more “pep” than usual
was exhibited at the Saturday game,
which resulted in a Soph victory 7-4.
B. N. White started things off for his
team. followed by Thames and = Mc-
Nair’s hits. Jamie and Sam again op-
posed the Soph battery and did splendid
work, but were unable to take the ad-
vantage from the Sophs.

The deciding game between Juniors
and Seniors was played off Monday, the
19th, and resulted in a Senior victory
13-5. The game was not as fast as some
others, probably owing to the morning
heat. “Bill” Copeland pitched for the
Juniors as against ‘Callie’ McDonald.
while Boges and MclIntvre did the re-
ceiving. The standing is as follows:

WON LOST = PRCT
Sophs .. .. ; 3 oO 1000
Fresh .. .. .. .. 2 1 667
Seniors .. ...... 1 2 333
Juniors .. .. ... 0 3 000

At the Y. M. C. A. meeting which
will be held on Fridav night this week
instead of Thursday, Mr. Crane (’07)
will deliver an address.

The Furman Ganie.

Due to the fact that luck broke
against the Red and Black and that the
horseshoe appeared to be with Furman,
the latter were victorious in’ a fast and
excitme game plaved in Greenville on
April 2. '

‘Phe mighty hitting Presbyterian team
failed to crack out the long hits as usual
though they drove some long ones to the
outhelders who played forty vards deep-
er than usual and at was well that they
did tor on several occasions the ball went
to them and they had but little playing
to deta get beneath them.

Furman probably plaved her best:
pame of the season thus far, but even
then they were oateliassed by Davidson

and oaly luck won for them,

Kor Davidson, Somerville did the star
stick work, getting an even tour singles
out of four trips. to the plate. Lockman
was the star bitter for Furman, getting
three hits out ef three chances, one for -
three bags, one for a couple of sacks and
the last for a single.

Davidson was well
roofers since there area good Inany
aluinond in Coreenville, and the Furman
hovs had all therr hackers out. so the en-
tire time was amply Glled with racket.

these were well scattered.

On the day after the trolic with the

on their heme ground at Clinton and
had lite trouble in defeating them, the
score being 16 tao.

The entire team from Davidson seem-
