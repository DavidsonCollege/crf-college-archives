The Forum

There seems to be a tendency in Th-
Forum to use assumed names in signing
articles, or in some cases, no names a.
all. The permission of such a practice
by THe Davisonian gives.a chance fo.
a great deal of harm to be done to th.
paper and to the college by irresponsible
parties who feel secure because — their
identity is unknown,

‘The recent discussions about the stu-
dent council have brought out under as-
sumed names several statements which
the writers would hardly be willing tc
proclaim as their own, aad which can-
not help creating a false impression of
Davidson in the minds of outsiders. ‘Phe
article signed Petroleum V. Nasby IL.,
n the issue of April 4, is one of the most
tlaring examples which has come to. my
attention. Perhaps I am misjudging the
author; perhaps the article was intended
to he subtly sarcastic, and was so under-
If that was the case,
U should think that it ought to be labeled
for the benefit of outsiders, and even
alumni; but if it is a statement of the
writer's honest opinion, should be not
proclaim himself openly like a man, in-
stead of dealing a backhanded blow at
those who hold different opinions from

‘his own, and giving a false impression of

Davidson ideals. | believe that this is
putting the matter altogether too mildly.

I do not know whether the real name
of the writer of this artcle is known to
‘Tne Davisontan or not—l take it for
granted that it is, for, as a member of
the first Davivsonian Staff, I remem-
her that it was very distinctly under-
stcod, before the first issue was printed
—three, not four, years ago—that no ar-
ticle should be printed unless the writer
was known to the editors, whether his
rame was published or not. Upon this
condition only was it then possible to
publish the paper. Beyond this, it seems
to me that no article for which “Pur
Davisonian is unwilling to uke full
responsibility, particularly if it is con-
cerned with a moral issuc, should ever
be published except over the name of the
writer. Ifthe writer thinks enough of
his opinion to tell it to others, should
he not value it sufficiently to acknowl-
edge it as his own? Lf he is afraid the
disclosure of his identity will burt his
good name, would not his opinon better
go unpublished? IT do not mean to say
that no pseudonyms should be allowed,
but under the circumstances which [
have cited, it seems to me that they are
impossible.

The principle at stake is not a slight
one. Qn it hinges the choice between
manly, democratic, free speech and irre-
sponsible black-handism. Open discus-
sion can bring good results, but rash
anonymous statements can produce noth-
ing but harm, if to nothing else, to Dav-
idson's greatest asset, her good name.

(Editor’s Note: For the benefit of
the writer of the above article, and oth-
ers who may have doubts as to the tenor
and meaning of the article referred to,
we wish to state that the article signed
“Petroleum V. Nasby” was intended to
he absolutely sarcastic thru and thru.
The writer of the article is the last per-
son who would ever give forth such ex-
pressions as his own opinions of the mat-
ter. Under suggestion from work in
Senior English, he used this pen name
for his negative suggestion as did his
nrototyne. David Ross Locke, in the six-
ties. While THe Davinsontan Fdit-
ars do not claim to be perfect. we do not
believe we have lowered _ ourselves
enough to allow “irresponsible parties”
to cither openly or back-handedly “do a
vreat deal of harm to the paper and to
the College.” Every writer is known

to us, and an article deliberately laud-
ing the worst side of Davidson, and the
few evils existing here, would never have

been published.)

DR. McCONNELL GIVES
AN INSTRUCTIVE LECTURE

In Shearer Hall, Monday night, Dr.
1. W. McConnell gave a very interest-
‘ne and profitable lecture, illustrated
with stereoptican slides, on ‘“Tubercu-
‘ost and Typhoid Fever.” The causes
of these two diseases, which are so prev-
alent and yet so preventable, were
graphically displayed. Statistics were
given showing the large number carried
away each vear in the United States bv
‘he White Plague and tvphoid fever,
more Americans succumbing each year
than the Germans will probably kil!
with bullets during our war with them.
The means of preventing tuberculosis
and typhoid were shown, and a plea wae
made for cleanliness and sanitation ir
everything. Dr. McConnell also urged
evervone to be vaccinated with the anti-
typhoid serum. and gave statistics of its
results in the United States Army to
show its efficacy.

FUTURE PLANS OF
ORCHESTRA AND GLEE CLUB

On account of prevailing conditions.
the Orchestra and Glee Club cancelled
the trip which they had planned thre
South Carolina. In its stead the club
has arranged for a short trip to Char-
lotte and Gastonia. ‘The club will leave
the Hill Monday, April 16th, and give
a concert in Charlotte that night. From
Charlotte they will go to Gastonia on
the following day, and appear there
Tuesdav night, returning to Davidson
Wednesday morning.

SIX DAY SCHEDULE
BEGINS NEXT YEAR

At the last meeting of the Faculty it
was desided to change the schedule
from the regular one of five’ days to a
new one of six. Classes will start at
ta o'clock on Monday, and will continue
until 1:30, as usual, “Those professors
offering to take classes on Monday are
Drs. Arbuckle, Fulton, Harding ant
Lingle, and Professors Wood and With
ers.
This new. schedule will. lighten) th:
work considerably for those taking five
and six tickets, as it will) spread — the
“lasses cover more time, and will give onc
better opportunity to prepare them
thoroly.

We are grateful to some members of
the alumni from whom we have received
lerters of protest against the scathing
satire of Petroleum V. Nasby rt. [t
was intended as a piece of scarcasm and
as a joke, but many considered it as a
serious piece of writing, and those out-
side of the college would naturally think
so. The views he stated of course are
the views of a few spineless fellows, but
such is not the sentiment of the student
body—no- such ideas prevail here. At
this rate—judging’ from this article—
Davidson is producing a satirist of the
“Modest Proposal” type.
