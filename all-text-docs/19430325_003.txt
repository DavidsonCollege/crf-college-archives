MANY SOPHS LOST

Not only will two of the most colorful and
talented pair of atheletes in the country, the Peters
twins, go with the armed forces at the end of the sem-
ester, but many others have gone and will go in the
near future. Jackie Byrd a driving and firey basketeer
and one of the most promising tennis aces to hit the
campus in many a day, will go. Bob DuRant. a swift-
charging blocking back, wrestler and hurler, leaves
for the Army Air Force. Buck Williams. Gene Bing-
ham, and Luke Riffe are already in the service, and
have deprived the Red and Black of three of the best
all-round atheletes in the South. Bill Dunn, Art
Roach, Gwyn Fletcher and Buck Troutman won't be
furnishing Coach Gene McEver with first rate grid-
iron material next fall. And there are many. others.
This year’s sophomore class was the class of the
new Davidson in the field of sports, but the sophs
were shot to pieces by the war.

TOMMY AND PAT ELECTED

Not to be ignored is the nomination of Fommy Peters

TRACK MEET

This is Monday and qualifying for the inter-frat
track meet, has not yet begun, but if the results of
this year’s meet are similar to those of previous re-
lays and dashes, the deciding factors will be the points
gained by atheletes of varsity material, usually fresh-
men. This hardly seems fair to the ordinary intra-
mural atheletes, those who are not quite up to the
varsity calibre. Freshmen and upperclassmen who
have been working out-with-the varsity and-are reason-
ably assured of squad berths use the meet as a prov-
ing ground. ; Of course this can be of great help to the
coaching staff in getting a line on what the material
is-and-in-searching for latent talent, but it takes the
intramural atmosphere away fram track. The future
varsity stars usually clean up in the fraternity clash.
Whether or not a ne’~ system is preferable depends

upon the purpose of the event: There are two sides to
the question.
