Holland will, however, face
some more concrete problems

women’s. sports must grow
“to Title IX requirements and
beyond.”

Despite his inexperience in
administration, Holland is
confident that he and the rest
of the athletic department can
build women’s sports “from
the ground up.”

“Ihave had a chance to meet
with most of the coaches, and
I’m impressed with the staff,”

he commented.
