Rosenbach challenges requirement that
college president. be “active churchman’

By Courtauld McBryde

At the SGA's last meeting,
SGA President Eric. Rosenbach
presented a proposal concerning a
change in Davidson's by-laws
which affects the qualifications for
the president of Davidson College.

Article IV, Section 1 of the
by-laws states: “[The trustees] shall
elect only a person who is a loyal
and active churchman, giving evi-
dence by his life of the strength of
his Christian faith and expressed
by his affiliation with the Presby-

terian Church in the United States
and his active participation in the
life of the College Church.”
Rosenbach says there is some-
thing “inherently wrong” with this
statement and with the retirement
of President Kuykendall approach-
ing in two years, Rosenbach ea-
gerly addresses this matter.
“There are less than 1.5 mil-
lion Presbyterians,” Rosenbach
says; he argues that when conduct-
ing a college president search un-
der the present qualifications, “the
candidate pool is severely limited.”

Rosenbach conveyed to the
SGA that President Kuykendall
feels strongly that his Presbyterian
title does not affect his job one way
or another.

At the next SGA meeting,
Rosenbach will present a resolu-
tion containing a change concern-
ing the religious qualifications of
the president as stated in the by-
laws,

The resolution will face dis-
cussion and debate by the SGA
before any other action is taken.

Sentelle's wiring safe, but to be replaced

By Matthew Eirich

Richard Terry, Director of the
Residence Life office, observed
during his time as a student at
Davidson in the 1970s that there
were only a few stereos and toaster-
ovens and perhaps one TV per
hall. Now with nearly every room
having more than one of these
items, a heavy burden is put upon
the wiring system.

RLO recently decided, along
with Associate Director of Utili-
ties Phillip Cashion, to rewire
Sentelle entirely. According to
Terry, this project is expected to
cost approximately $90,000 and
will be completed in the summer
of 1996.

Cashion describes the situa-
tion as an “upgrade” rather than a
repair. However, it is Cashion’s
opinion thatthe situation in Sentelle
is safe; “There is nothing wrong
‘with the wiring,” he said.

Terry backs this conclusion
because his office has received “no
real evidence students are having
difficulties with electrical short-
ages.”

Terry says that several years
ago there were electrical difficul-
ties in Duke dormitory, such as
fuses popping and power surges.
The wiring was quickly repaired.

“We. would fix anything that
was wrong right now because we

don’t want anything to happen or
go wrong,” says Cashion.

Terry stresses that if prob-
lems exist in Sentelle, students
ought to report them immediately.

Junior Mike Bode, a resident
of first Sentelle, expresses concern
that the outlets in the dorm are not
grounded. A grounded outlet ac-
cepts a three-pronged plug, and
helps protect what is plugged into

_ the outlet against a power surge

from an external source, such as
lightning.

The outlets will be grounded
when the wiring is replaced, ac-
cording to Terry, but the situation
now is “not dangerous or essen-
tial.”

Students can purchase an

adapter, which when used prop--

erly, will ground and protect the
electronics plugged into the outlet.
A limited number of adapters can
be purchased through the Resi-
dence Life Office at a nominal
cost.

First Sentelle Resident Advi-
sor Stephen Aldridge explains that
he is using as many as four power
strips at a time to accomodate com-
puter and stereo equipment.
“T worry that this is dangerous,” he
says.

Cashion explains that the out-
let system planned for Sentelle will
be “like Cannon’s.” Ifneed arises,
more outlets will be added.
