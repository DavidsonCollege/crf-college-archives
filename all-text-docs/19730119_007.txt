Earle, Robinson Square Off
For College Union Presidency

By ALEC HOON
Managing Editor

Sophomore Gray Robinson
and junior Joe Earle have an-
nounced their intention to run
for President of the College
Union

Earle said that he was in-
terested in ‘establishing the
best possible programs for the
Union, and in becoming more
aware of what could be done on
this campus in the way of Union
activities.”

Earle has been involved with
the Union since his freshman
year when he was a member of
the Social Council. During his
sophomore year, he served as
the first Publicity Chairman for
the Union, and as a member of

KARLE

the Executive Board, as one of
the two at-large members.

This year he has added the
jobs of being head of the Union
Bar and Co-chairman of the 50's
communittee to his duties as a
continuing member of the
Social Council and _ the
Executive Board.

He indicated that he would
‘like to give people as much as
possible for their money by put-
ting more emphasis on the
Union's co-curricular and social
activities.

‘I would like to see more
programs like the 50's program
which serve to give extended
and cohesive entertainment
over a long period of time (10
days) ,"’ he said.

Earle concluded by saying

ROBINSON

that he felt that his “extensive
experience and technical un-
derstanding of the operation of
the Union’ made him qualified
for the job

Robinson said that he was in-
terested in the job because ‘the
Union needs revitalization

“The only activity that I can
see going on is with the pinball
and fussball games. We need to
get people involved again in
Union activities.” he said

He stated that he wanted to
make several specific im-
provements including getting
more landmark films of an
educational] nature. in bringing
more good speakers who could.
in addition to their formal! lec-
tures. meet on an informal
basis with students. and in ob-
taining a permit to sel] beer on
the campus.

* And even if we were unable to
obtain a beer licence. I would
like to make a better snack bar
which offered more variety.”
he said

Robinson indicated that he
felt it was a duty of the Union to
present something every
weekend. so that students would
not pack up and leave because
there was nothing to do on cam-

pus.

‘| think that I could do a good
job as President of the Union
because I've got some fresh
ideas on what ‘needs to be done
here. I'm not tied down by the
traditional approach to Union
activities.” he said.

Candidate Jum Goodloe feels
that the RHC should be made 2
committee the Senate instead of
beimg a separate organization
as it is now

“The dorm Senators would be
on this commuttee I fee! that
this would make them more
responsible to the dorm residen-
ts and cut out some red tape.”
said Goodloe

‘I'd also like for the Senate to
have a voice in the appointment
of the house managers. which ts

now done solely by the ad
munistration
“Pressure.” Goodloe con-

tinued. “should be brought on
the administration to keep the

tle up with girls when there are

Steve Smith has zeroed in ona
coin operated laundry and bet-

Students as his main issues.

“I think that students could

GOODLOE

Save about $50 a year on their
laundry with com machimes.”
said Smith ~Specia! attention
must be given to finding new
positions in the college for
peopie that have been working
in the laundry for a long time

“I also feel that the traffic
court amd the RHC have a
responsibility to do something
about the parking situation.”
said Smith

“The RHC needs to pay
special attention to freshmen
and peopie who have to find
their recreation on campus for
the most part. he said

“Il was on the dorm social
council at Syracuse last vear
and | think that my experience
there can help me to do
something about the negative
spirit towards the RHC and the
SGA here.” Smith said.
