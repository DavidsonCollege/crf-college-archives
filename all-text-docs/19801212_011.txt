fessor William Frey, a Finance Council
member, said he agreed with Polley.

The other professors who were mem-
bers of the Council last spring—
Psychology Professor John Kello, Ger-
man Professor Thomas Pinkerton, and
English Professor Randy Nelson—were
not available for comment. -

“Religion Professor David Kaylor des-
cribed the talk about the $85,000 cut last
spring as ‘“‘very misleading.” He said he
fully expected there to be an overall cut
in athletics expenditures and felt most of
his colleagues had the same impression.

Spencer insisted there was ‘“‘no mys-
tery in it and no attempt to mislead
anyone.’ He said the confusion arose
‘*because the budgeting process isn’t
understood.’’

“T really doubt that there was any
conscious deception at all,””’ Polley said.

Assistant Athletic Director Thomas
Couch itemized the $85,000 cut and
emphasized that the athletic budget is as
tight as it can be.

He listed cuts in 12 areas:

— Medical insurance, $20,000 cut.
Normally, the College’s insurance pol-
icies cover all injuries to athletes. To

save money there is now an exception for

football players only, since they are the
most often injured. Football players
must cover the first $500 of their medical

_ expenses by private means.

— Vehicles, $11,000 cut. In the past

few years the Athletic Department —

traded in its two cars and van each year;
this year the Department will not. Couch
pointed out that delaying the trade-in
will not save much money in the long
run, for the vehicles’ value constantly
depreciates.

—Stables, $10,000 cut. The Athletic
Department allocated this amount from
its 1979-80 budget to build horse stables
at the lake campus. The stables are
virtually complete and will not receive
any Athletic Department funding this
year.

—Awards, $4,900 cut. Last year
$5500 was budgeted for awards and
banquets. This year $589 is budgeted.
Couch said Athletic Director Eugene
Bingham is thinking of -getting local
alumni to finance a sports banquet since
the Athletic Department cannot.

—Football recruiting, $5,000 cut.

—Team equipment, $5,000 cut. This
cut includes all sports except football

except football in which we’re Division
IAA. We haven't studied it enough right
now to call for specific changes —but we
do want to look hard.

Kiss As [Football Coach]-Ed Farrel
said, too, this is something that needs
constant re-assessment. This is not to
say we're anti-football or anti-basket-
ball.

Siman But money is tight, so it’s
important that the paper look at ...all
areas of allocation [of money].

Purcell I’m all for going after these
minor sports and really sponsoring
them, but I think we need to scrutinize
the major sports because I do think they
have a role to play. We need to keep a
careful eye on the major sports.

I think faculty salaries are a concern. I
think we should do a study sometime, as
cost-benefit study with other schools to
see what they’re getting for their tuition
and what we’re getting for ours. That
may be a better way to approach some of
these problems.

Another thing that really concerns me
is the student-teacher ratio. It’s kind of

Phonathon

false right now.

Soracco Majors have such a rush to
get the courses they want in their
department that are also popular with
non-majors. We need to look at expan-
sion of faculty in these areas, whereas in
a smaller department where the demands
are not as large or the majors are not as
large, therefore the class is more
proportionate; in those type situations
there are maybe twelve students and one
teacher, whereas in larger departments
like economics there are thirty students.

Purcell We’re also concerned with
tuition. Since I’ve been here, it’s gone up
$1000 and I’m sure it will go up another
$500 for next year. I’d hate to see
Davidson become a rich kid’s school, not
to say it’s going in that direction
though. It’s a moral obligation to do
everything we can to keep tuition down.

Siman Bill has talked about how we
must be concerned with finances and
keeping tuition down. That’s something
Elizabeth and I have not only been
concerned about but we’ve been doing a
helluva lot about. We’ve done a slew of

and basketball.

— Tennis court supplies, $3,500 cut.

. —Maintenance supplies, $2,500 cut.
This cut includes maintenance of the
pool, gym, sports equipment, and
grounds used for athletics.

—Office equipment, $2000 cut. ‘The
Athletic Department is spending no-
thing on office equipment this year.

— Travel for Athletic Director, $2,000
cut.

— Recruiting, $1,000 cut. This cut
includes all sports except football and
basketball and reduces the total amount
spent on recruiting for the minor sports
to $3300.

These cuts total about $70,000.

Couch said that last spring the
Athletics Department did not plan to
replace Women’s Sports Coach Susan
Roberts, who left Davidson. This per-
sonnel cut brought the total to $85,000.

However, Couch said, the Department
soon realized it was ‘‘impossible’’ to do
without a replacement for Roberts and
hired Coach Lisa Boyer, thereby re-
ducing the cut to $70,000.

On the other hand, Bingham works for
no compensation. This savings was not
anticipated in the budget, Couch said.

in the country that does it

Couch and Bingham agreed that. the
College spends the minimum amount
necessary to finance its athletics poli-
cies.

“I don’t think there’s another school
any cheaper
than we do,” Couch said. “I don’t think
it’s possible.”

Davidson said a $71,800 increase in
wages and a $3,500 increase in benefits
(such as medical insurance) were bud-
geted for Athletics Department person-
nel in 1980-81. These compensation
increases erased the $70,000 in actual
budget cuts (note that the proposed cut
of Robert’s former job is not included)
and caused th overall Athletic budget to
rise.
letics Department’s personnel’s salary
hikes were in line with the increase
awarded to all College faculty and staff.

articles on money; it’s been an ongoing
theme.

Purcell There are a couple of other
issues that haven’t been exhausted yet.
There’s still some room for debate and
inquiry into the tenure situation I think.
There are also still lots of unanswered
questions about self-selection; it may
not become a news item but it needs to
be made one.

As a-means of tying your thoughts
together, would each of you briefly and
concisely state your reasons for running.

Kiss I think we’ve already established
that The Davidsonian is a very impor-
tant organization for building this
community, for recognizing the
strengths and weaknesses of the College.
On a more personal level, at the risk of
sounding clicheish, The Davidsonian is
in my blood. I’m running because I care
about this school; I think I could do a
good job. It would be my contribution to
this college community. I can’t imagine
not working for The Davidsonian; I’ve
done it ever since I’ve been here. It’s
become sometimes a bigger part of my

Basketball

life than some of my classes.

Siman I really believe in The David-
sonian. Out of all the things students
can do to help influence college policy,
and out of all the things we can do to
make Davidson a better place, it’s
through The Davidsonian. If The David-
sonian is accurate, if it takes good
reasonable stands, it’s something people
will and have to listen to. The Davidson-
ian takes precedent over any of my
classes.

Purcell Well, I’m not in love with the
paper. I’m a Davidson person; I believe
in Davidson. I think there’s a lot good
about it, and there are a lot of problems
people need to know about. I think I
have some good insight into these areas.
This is a good way for me to approach
them.

Soracco I’ve enjoyed working for the
paper, and that’s one reason I’d want to
do more. I’ve seen it improve, but I
think there’s more room for improve-
ment and I'd like to help it make that
meatal I’d like to see it meet its
