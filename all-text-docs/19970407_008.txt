FCC orders TV to go digital

Calling it the biggest change in
television since “color,” the federal
government ordered more than
1,500 of the nation’s television sta-
tions from their current analog
signal’s to digital signals by the
year 2006.

The new signals are supposed
to let crystal clear, movie quality,
pictures and sound be received by
any home that owns a i ae televi-
sion set.

So, yes, it means that people
will have to get new TV’s or fix
their old ones with a $100 con-
verter.

Still, the new signals will be
broadcast along with the analog sig-
nals until 2006, so viewers will have
a period to change to the new sets.

The initial sets will be in stores
by 1998 and will probably cost
around $5,000.

By then, the biggest 10 metro-
politan areas will have been required
or have volunteered to make the
switch.

Each station would be able to
offer 6 channels of programming
with digital signals instead of the
one they can only give now, so even

. people who donotsubscribe to cable

will have 20-36 channels.
While the changes do look as if
broadcasters are being forced to

* make unwanted changes, it is not

entirely bad for any of them.

They will now have a more
lenient use of the public broadcast
spectrum and will be freed of many

Immigration law goes
officials fear ability to enforce

After a legal delay of four days,
the new Immigration law passed in
the last Congress went into effect
last Saturday.

However, given the first set-
back, Justice Department officials
fear they will not be able to ad-
equately enforce it given continued
legal challenges the law has received
from the American Civil Liberties
Union and immigrant’s rights
groups.

The law aims to stem the tide of
400,000 thousand illegal immi-
grants who enter the country each
year. An estimated 5,000,000 ille-
galimmigrants live in the U.S. right
now.

The law states that illegal aliens
must apply for political asylum
within one year of entering the
United States, that tougher “hard-

ship” requirements should be made
for immigrants who seek a green
card on that basis, that class action
suits against the Immigration and
Naturalization Service be harder to
charge, and that if someone lives in
the country for six months or more
illegally, they will be barred from
reentry for three years.

The opposing groups feel the
laws are too strict. The ACLU fears
that one year will not be enough to
legally prove that political asylum
is needed.

The law is intended to stop
those who call for it who get caught
illegally living in the U.S.

Immigrant groups also fear
that new hardship requirements will
be impossible to meet and that it
will leave an “open door” for the
government to deport whomever

other government regulations on
their activities regarding content and
payment fees.

Cable television and satellite
companies, who will be most hurt
by the plan, are calling it the biggest
“federal giveaway ever” since the
stations will be receiving $70 bil-
lion dollars worth of free channels.

As the new televisions grow in
popularity, their cost is expected to
go down to $2,000.

The changes also mean most
people will have to go back to put-
ting antennas on their televisions
however, since most cable systems
across the country are not equipped
-to transmit digital signals.

into effect,

they wish regardless of the need.’

Recently immigrants’ lawyers
have been able to use the existing
law to allow a Nicaraguan to stay in
the U.S. because of his love for
baseball.

The bar on class action law-
suits makes the opposing groups
fear the government will be able to
turn away thousands of immigrants
at once instead of reviewing each
case personally,

The Justice Department cites
the growing numbers of illegal
aliens entering the country each year
and the fact that the existing law
does not allow them to stem that
tide as proof the new laws are
needed.

Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany said he would run for an
unprecedented fifth four-year term in elections next year. Kohl is a
strong supporter of the European Union and has had to oversee

organization. Kohl is 67 years old. He is already the country’s longest
serving postwar Chancellor. If elected he will the country’s most
durable leader since Bismarck, who unified Germany in 1871 and

Fusion reactor shutting down soon

The fusion test reactor at the Princeton Plasma Physics Labonitory
reached the end of 15 years of work intended to produce power by the
fusion of hydrogen, the process that powers the sun. The reactor’s
demise because of a cut in Federal spending threatened hopes for
generating clean and inexhaustible energy from the process of fusion.

Cult partied before leaving

Detailed financial records kept by the “Heaven s Gate” cult showed
that a total of $12,183.15 was spent before they decided to catch a
spaceship to the “next level.”

They gambled in Las Vegas, saw a movie, and dined on a pizza feast
before killing themselves. The rest of the cult member’s possessions
will be auctioned or disposed in the following weeks.

Gingrich sets it straight with China’ "
Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, on his tour to Asia the past week,
received praise from House Democrats for his diplomatic statements
to China and Taiwan. Gingrich said that United States would defend
Taiwan against a military attack by China, but supports China’s claim
to the island as long as reunification is peaceful. He also told
Taiwanese leaders that military aid would not be forthcoming if
Taiwan provoked China.
