A New Ballot System
There is a movement in the student body
today which gathering strength

is slowly

for agitation for open politics. By this it.
is understood that candidates will either
state their qualifications themselves, or

have their campaign managers state them
for them, speeches will be made, accompani-
ed by parades, free, cigars and whatever
the party or “clique” treasury can“afford.
It is even rumored that this will entice stu-
dents away from such attractions as Hona
Massey. I doubt it!

But will the situation be changed in any
essential? No, for the fraternity man will
still vote, with few exceptions, for the man
that his lodge is supporting whether he be
withih his fraternity or. not; Swapping of
votes will go.on; cliques will flourish galore.
And to cap it off, as the commentator on

this subject saitt tast week, “But it will be
legal.” And that makes everything rosy!
Truly then will politics be discussed on the
porch of Georgia, instead of the first floor
hall. Of what is there to be scared?

What will happen to those students who
do not belong to fraternities? Unless some-
one risks their political and perhaps physical

neck to organize -them, they will still vote
for the man whom they have heard since
theiy sophomore year is going to be elected
chief Door-man. And he is! If they do
organize, they willbe out. vated on the
count!

-So let us continue with the situation 4s
itis. It gives us something to gripe about.

. those who are being eriped at just have
to listen they needn't worry. They’ll
get elected, reg ardless.

_open: politics?

But I am not in favor of open politics at
Davidson. Perhaps if we had a school of two
thousand or more students, open politics would
be the only solution, but in a school of only
seven hundred students such a system has no
place.

There has-been much hue and’cry about the’

in years past, I think it will be admitted that
only in few, very few, cases could better men
have been elected to these offices. Of course
there have been. exceptions, “the best man” has
but the
system of politics, open or closed, there will
always be these exceptions. There will be a
goodly number who will swear that “the best
man” was not elected, in every election. I do
not believe that open politics would to any
degree raise the calibre of our leaders.

not always been chosen, whatever

Granted that open politics would bring out
into the open the so-called “hypocrisy” of our
present system, I rather doubt that the elimi-
nation of this evil would be a fair exchange
for the evils which are inherent in the open
political systems. Conditions in colleges and.
universities in our own and neighboring states
would hardly‘ bear an honest investigation.
Davidson students advocating such a system
because of the “corruptness” of our own would,
if as sincere as they apparently are in their
condemnation of political corruption, be forced
to really throw up their hands at circumstances
surrounding these elections. We, in scrapping
closed politics would be making a very bad
trade.

Closed politics, idealistic as it may seem is
the only system in strict keeping with David-
son and Davidson traditions. And say what
you may, Davidgon traditions really exist and
play an extremely important part in making
