Whittle Unveils Thinclads
In News-Piedmont Relays

By CHARLIE TERRELL
Asst. Sports Editor

The Davidson Wildcat track
team, dominated by freshmen
and sophomores, launches its
outdoor season tomorrow at
Greenville, S. C. in the News-
Piedmont Relays.

Coach Heath Whittle, who has
guided Davidson track teams
since 1930 and is retiring after
this season, is very enthusiastic
about this year’s squad.

‘We have some very good
prospects on the team, and it
will be much better balanced
than last year,” explained Whit-
tle.

Two major reasons for Whit-
tle’s enthusiasm are seniors Ray
Swetenburg and Tommy Rich-
ardson, who each won cham-
pionships in the 1971 conference
winter meet.

They did inot successfully de-
fend their titles this winter, but
they are still counted on as the
big point-makers for the squad.

Swetenburg will participate in
no less than five events, the
440-yard relay, triple jump, long
jump, high jump and the 120-
yard high hurdles. ‘“‘Ray is so
versatile that he can score well
in any of these events,’ noted
Whittle.

Sprinter Richardson will run
the 100 and 220-yard dashes, the
440-relay and the mile-relay.

Richardson has clocked a 9.6
in the hundred, and was the top-
ranking sprinter in the confer-
ence until slowed by a pulled
muscle midway through last
season. Injuries have plagued
him throughout his career, and
if he escapes the nemesis, big-
ger things are in store for the
veteran.

The other senior on the squad
is veteran distance man How-
ard Boyd, whose specialties are
the one-mile and_ three-mile
runs. Boyd serves with Sweten-
burg and Richardson as tri-
captain.

A wealth of young talent
boosts the fortunes of the thin-
clads, and Whittle belives that
many of the freshmen could de-
velop into stellar performers.

Heading the list of new talent
are sprinter Mark Connors and
distance runner Rick Bell.” Con-
nors is coming along nicely in
the 440, and he will also help
in the 220,” observed Whittle.

Bell is the premier miler on
the team, and he will perform
in the 880-yard run as well.

Other freshmen counted on by
Whittle for added depth are
Bob Lautensack in the mile and
three-mile, Rick Mullen in the
880 and possibly the mile relay,
Rick Deal in the three-mile,
Dave Peaco in the 44) relay
and intermediate hurdles, Steve
Still in the intermediate hur-
dies, and Bob Trumbo in the
high hurdles. ;

The field events should also
be very deep for the Cats. Swet-
enburg anchors the jumping
events, and he is joined by
sophomore Tom Case and ex-
change student Helmut Bern-
hardt in the triple and long
jumps, and by Peaco and Bern-
hardt in the high jump.

Whittle is encouraged by the
progress of freshman Woody
van Meter in the pole vault. ““He
can do 12’6” now and he should
be able to clear 13’ before too
long,’ said Whittle.

The shot put will be manned
by sophomores Steve Shankweil-
er and Glenn Mee, and fresh-
man Rick Howdy. Junior Dave
Crumpler is a strong discuss
man, backed by Shankweiler
and Howdy.

“We will be weakest in the
javeline,’ said Whittle, “but I
think Craig Crosswhite, John
Davis and Mee will begin to
show improvement.”

The talented but generally in-
experienced Wildcats offer the
prospect of a winning season

Inexperienced Netters

Lose Opening Matches

By TOM AINSWORTH
News Editor

“Lack of experience” and
‘Too many foolish little errors”
were the trademarks attributed
to the Wildcat tennis team by
Coach Harry Fogleman as the
netmen dropped their opening
season matches to Eastern Ken-
tucky and Duke by respective
scores of 54 and 9-0.

In last Friday's contest
against the Eastern Kentucky
club, Dave Weaver dropped his
singles maich against Bruce
Simms in straight sets, 6-3 and
6-3, and Rick Quinby followed
suit with consecutive losses of
6-3 and 6-2.

In the other singles matches,
the Cats triumphed in the num-
ber two, four, five, and six po-
sitions of Bill Allen, Gary Bress-
ler, Bill DuPont, and Scoot Di-
mon.

for Whittle. In his 42 years of
coaching at Davidson, Whittle
has suffered only three losing
seasons while compiling a work-
sheet of 166 victorics, 74 losses
and 2 ties.

“William
win the conference easily, be-
cause nobody can touch them”
commented Whittle. ‘‘East Car-
olina and Furman will fight for
second and third, and Rich-
mond will probably get fourth
because of their~ sprinters. I
hope that we can place fifth,
and we can if our young men
get enough experience.’

“We have a good chance at
a winning season, and I would
love to go out as a winner,’ he

- concluded.

On this age!
How tasteless
and ill-bred

is it!

The doubles matches, and thus
the overall win, went to the visi-
tors as all three Davidson teams
fell in straight sets.

Weaver and Quinby lost to
Geron and Young in sets of 64
and 6-3, Allen and DuPont fell
to the team of Simms and Ste-
phenson 64 and 7-6, as the Ken-
tucky pair of Greenup and Bal-
lard downed Dimon and Dorsett
by scores of 6-2 and 6-4.

Monday’s meeting with Duke
University saw no improvement,
however, as all of the matches
were taken by the Blue Devils.
In that decision, the only match-
cs not taken in consecutive sets
were Dave Weaver's loss to
Charlie Benedick of 2-6, 6-3, 2-6
and Bill Dupont’s fall to the
Devil’s David Palmer in sets of
3-6, 64, and 1-6.

As in the first match of the
year, the doubles were swept
by the opponents, as the Cat's
best showing was Allen and Du-
Pont's first set win of 7-6 be-
fore losing the next two by
scores of 2-6 in both.

As a result, Fogleman ke-
gan to inaugurate a series of
drills in varsity practice, de-
signed to improve the team’s
confidence and elimimate cost-
ly mistakes.

He feels that the exercises
have improved the team’s per-
formance cnormously, citing
Wednesday’s practice as prob-
ably the best of the year.

Although himself sidelined by
a serious foot injury, Coach Fo-
gleman has nonetheless been
present at all practices, giving
valuable assistance to an other-
wise inexperienced team. ‘‘Po-
tentially, we're going to be all
right,” he said.

The netters face a_ tough
schedule ahead, however, with
one of the stiffer contests to be

faced on Saturday against a
very good Cincinnati team.

In regard to Fogleman him-
self, the doctors say that it will
be a couple of months before he
is able to do any exercise on
his foot at all, infecting it after
siepping on a piece of metal.
There was even the danger that
Fogleman might have lost the
foot as a result, but ine has re-
covered.
