The Wildcat defense was
ready to play against Pennsyl-
vania on Saturday, but someone
must have forgotten to tell the of-
fense about the game.

Pennsylvania scored enough
points in the first minute of the
game to mar _ Davidson’s
Homecoming with a loss. On the
Cats third play from scrimmage,
sophomore quaterback Charlie
Winborne was sacked in the end
zone. The 2-0 lead that resulted
proved to be all the Quakers
needed, as Davidson’s offense
failed to score in the game. The 13
points added by the Pennsylvania
offense for the final score of 15-0
served merely as icing.

The Davidson defense put ona
sterling performance. Despite
giving up 242 yards rushing and
146 yards through the air, the
Wildcat defensive squad held
Pennsylvania to a touchdown and
two field goals. The Davidson de-
fense managed to hold Pennsyl-
vania to only one field goal in the
second half despite their apparent
exhaustion. They remained on the
field for almost two thirds of the
game.

There were several solid indi-
vidual performances. Except for
one series in the second quarter,
senior defensive back Tony Smith
played an excellent game. He
broke up two passes, one to which

he reached out at the last second
and tapped away just before it hit
the receiver’s hands. In the fourth
quarter, Smith made what could
have been the Cats’ biggest play
of the game. He stepped in front of
a Pennsylvania receiver at mid-
field for an interception and raced
50 yards for what appeared to be a
touchdown. Unfortunately, an of-
ficial said he stepped out of
bounds at the 13 yard line. David-
son’s offense was unable to score
from there.

Junior defensive back Gary
Stewart also had a good game. He
made several tackles to stop po-
tential big gains, and in the fourth
quarter he hauled in an intercep-
tion of his own in the end zone.

On the defensive line, the Cats
got good play from senior tackle

Andy McCary and junior tackle

Charles Showers. With the Quak-
ers in a second down situation
with one yard to go for a first
down deep in Davidson territory,
McCary blasted through the line
to register a sack and a nine-yard
loss, effectively stifling the drive.

Showers made a big play in
the second quarter with the Quak-
ers facing third down and 13 at the
Davidson 23-yard line. He put so
much pressure on the quaterback
that he was forced to rush his
throw, which fell incomplete.
Pennsylvania had to settle for a
field goal.

Senior linebackers Chuck
Goff and Micah Downing also
played very well. Goff was in on
several tackles and made a first
quarter interception. Downing
also had a number of tackles and
registered a third quarter sack for a
loss of eight yards.

The score of a soccer game
doesn’t always reflect a team’s
performance. Look at the last
week of Davidson soccer.

Last Saturday, Davidson beat
Marshall 2-1 despite a lackadaisi-
cal effort. Then on Wednesday,
the Wildcats lost to seventh-
ranked South Carolina 5-0 despite
playing even for almost the entire
game.

Davidson has a 6-7-2 record
for the season, 3-0 in the Southern
Conference.,The Cats are cur-
rently ranked tenth in the South.

The soccer team kicked off the
activities of Homecoming last
Saturday against Marshall in a less
impressive manner than they

would have liked. Marshall
looked psyched up for the game
and played with a lot of intensity.

Davidson, despite a less en-
thusiastic effort, displayed their
superior talent throughout the
game. The Wildcats’ skill and the
Thundering Herd’s effort cancel-
led each other out to produce a ba-
lanced first half.

Senior Sean Goudie broke the
ice for Davidson by pouncing ona
loose ball made possible by a
cross from sophomore David Ros-
selot.

the half when a chip pass came to
the top of the penalty area. A Mar-

Cross country fares

The State Cross-Country
Championships of North Carolina
turned into the N.C. State fun run
on Thursday, October 17th.
While the Davidson women’s
team finished seventh and the
men’s team eighth, N.C. States’
teams cruised to nearly un-
molested victories, including the
individual titles.

The Davidson women’s team,
running with number one conten-

der Kappa Peddy, still managed to
slip by UNCC, even though
Peddy is currently out of the com-
petition with a recurring knee
problem.

“Running without Kappa cost
us at least one place in the team
standings,” coach Sterling Martin
said, The Cats finished directly
behind St. Augustine. Both Mar-
tin and assistant coach Sarah Pat-
terson were far from disappoint-
ment, however. “Both the men

shall forward caught junior goalie
Jim Kelly charging out of the goal
mouth, lobbed one over on him
and knotted the game at one.

The game’s best moment
came in the second half when
sophomore Andy Clarke scored a
break away goal. Sophomore
Steve Ott set up the goal with a
beautiful through pass that al-
lowed Clarke to run to the open
spare behind the defenders.
Clarke slammed a long shot from
the wing past the helpless Mar-
shall goalie to ice the game for
Davidson, 2-1.

“We were a step slow the en-
tire match,” coach Charlie Slagle
said. “We weren’t anticipating

and could have played much bet-
ter. Still, I'll take the win.”

Davidson’s trip to Colombia
on Wednesday turned sour late in
the second half. South Carolina
led 1-0 at halftime and dominated
the first half.

The first twenty minutes of the
second half Davidson played even
with the gamecocks. Then South
Carolina got a goal that combined
skill, fate and a convenient re-
bound to make the score 2-0.

Then the floodgates opened.
Another rebound goal made the
score 3-0. Sophomore Josh Budde
replaced Kelly in goal, but South
Carolina didn’t stop. Two goals
later the game was over and South

Senior Judy Dalton led the
way for the Cats, placing 31st.
She was followed by sophomores

and Sarah Langley and by senior
Caroline Kelly.

The men’s team also finished
one spot ahead of UNCC as senior
Frank Hague once again led the
Cats’ scoring. Hague placed 40th
in 27:07, his best time ever over
the N.C. State course. Junior

Greg Foreman came in 21 seconds
behind Hague. Senior Rob Wat-

and junior Emil Cekada finished
off Davidson’s scoring.

“T felt strong,” Foreman said.

The Cats travel to Harrisburg,
Virginia on Saturday to face
James Madison. There’s no let up, °
JMU is another tough opponent
and it will be a real upset if the
Cats can beat them.

Carolina went away 5-0 winners.

“They are a tough team, espe-
cially at home,” Slagle said. “We
played better than the score indi-
cated, but they are an extremely
talented team and deserve their
ranking.”

This weekend will play a cru-
cial role in the Wildcats’ confer-
ence championship hopes. To-
night the Cats play Marshall
again, this time in West Virginia.
Then Davidson travels to VMI for
a match on Sunday. If the Cats can
win both games, the upcoming
game with Appalachian State
won't be nearly as crucial as in
past years. Still, Davidson must
win both games this weekend to
make life easier.

competition. For the first time, a
womens’ championship will be
held. Marshall, Western
Carolina, UT-Chattanooga, Ap-
palachian State, East Tennessee
State and Davidson will all be
eligible for the championship.
Furman will send its unofficial
club team.

Since VMI and the Citadel do
not admit women to their schools,
neither school will send a
women’s team.
