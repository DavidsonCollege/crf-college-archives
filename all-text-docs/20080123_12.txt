Curry and Company undefeated in SoCon

By MIKE FRONGELLO

Davidson celebrated one hundred years of basketball on
Saturday. Stephen Curry ’10 continued the tradition and
wowed the many former players who had returned for the
game with one of the greatest one-half performances in
Wildcats’ history. Curry’s 27 first-half points paced the ’Cats
to a 41-26 halftime advantage and UT-Chattanooga never
recovered as the Wildcats impressed the season-high home
crowd of 5,361 with an easy 85-58 blowout victory.

While single-handedly outscoring the Mocs in the first
half, Curry just missed setting the record for points in a peri-
od by one point, but still 08 with a game-high 37 points.
Three other Wildcats scored in double figures including
Boris Meno ’08, who finished with 12 points off the bench
with most of his points coming from a handful of sensation-
al dunks that energized the home fans. Jason Richards °08
also added 13 points to go along with nine assists and
Andrew Lovedale °10 pitched in 10 points on 5-6 shooting
for Davidson.

The ’Cats got off to a quick start and never trailed in the
contest as they opened the game on a 5-0 run fueled by a
Lovedale jumper and a three-point play by Curry. Curry
drained six three-pointers in the first half, including one just
before the half that put the exclamation point on Davidson’s
15-6 run. The shot secured a 15-point halftime lead.

The Mocs, who entered the game in second place in the
Southern Conference behind Davidson, never got closer than
the halftime margin and trailed by as many as 30 in the sec-
ond half. The ’Cats displayed an inspiring defensive per-
formance holding Chattanooga to 36.7% shooting on the
afternoon and forcing 23 turnovers that resulted in 29 points.

’08 leading the way with six.

The victory continued Davidson’s recent hot streak which
began over holiday break after a heart-breaking 66-65 loss at
N.C. State on December 21. Curry, who is currently averag-
ing 23.8 points per game, scored 29 points against the
Wolfpack, including the go-ahead three-pointer with 24 sec-
onds left, but it would not be enough for the "Cats. Wolfpack
guard Gavin Grant was fouled on a lay-up with three sec-
onds and sank both free throws to give the home team a one-
point lead. Curry’s desperation half-court shot hit the back
rim and the Wildcats suffered another devastating loss to an
ACC foe.

Davidson responded to that loss with inspired play and

remains unbeaten in 2008. Since the loss, Davidson has
played flawless basketball and had won seven straight
entering Monday’s road conference tilt at Western
Carolina. Saturday’s win not only extended the ’Cats
overall winning streak to six, but it also extended their
Southern Conference regular season winning streak to 18.

In their first game after the setback in Raleigh, the
Wildcats started off the New Year by downing SoCon
opponent Georgia Southern 92-67 at Belk Arena on Jan. 3.
Curry scored 24 points and pulled down 10 rebounds in
the game to lead Davidson. The ‘Cats followed up that
victory with an 86-73 home victory over Western Carolina
on Jan. 5.

After notching a pair of home wins, the Wildcats took
to the road for a trio of SoCon road games, first stopping
at Elon, where they survived a poor shooting effort and
won a tight 59-57 contest. The ’Cats trailed 57-51 with
2:41 remaining in regulation and at this point Curry had a
mere seven points, but the sophomore showed poise in
scoring the game’s final eight points, including a left-
handed runner in the lane to put Davidson ahead for good
with 1:07 to play.

The Wildcats needed less dramatics in roads victories
over Wofford and Furman the following week. Davidson
cruised to 85-50 and 73-51 victories, respectively. After
Monday night’s 82-67 victory at Western Carolina the
’Cats are in good position to claim their third straight reg-
ular season SoCon championship. Curry and Richards led
the ’Cats again, combining for 47 points on !0 three-
pointers as the team’s overall and conference winning
streaks reached 7 and 19, respectively. Entering Thursday
night’s match-up with The Citadel in Charleston, S.C., the
Wildcats stand at 11-6 overall and remain undefeated in
the vonterence at 8-0.

Hemerka hits 1000 as Wildcats win 3 straight

Gaining steam as they enter the second half of their season,
the women’s basketball team improved its record with three
consecutive conference victories against Appalachian State
80-65, UNC Greensboro 70-59 and Elon 50-40. The team
now boasts an overall record of 10-7 with a Southern
Conference record of 4-2.

Against the Mountaineers in Belk Arena, Honna Housley
°08 tied a school record held by Janna Magette and Amy
Scalcucci with six three-pointers. She finished the afternoon
game with 18 points, matching her peer Danielle Hemerka
’08 for the game-high total. Hemerka collected a season-high
nine rebounds to accompany her solid scoring performance.
Julia Paquette "09 also joined her teammates in double-fig-
ures with 10 points off the bench.

Three Mountaineers scored in double digits; Brittany
Mixon and GiGi Thomas both scored 13 points each while
Whitey Tossie added 11 more. Luckily, their collective efforts
fell short.

With both teams vying for position in the first half, the
Wildcats claimed control of the game by launching a 16-2
run, lengthening the lead to 33-17 with 4:21 remaining in the
first half. The period ended with Davidson firmly in control,
40-26.

Hot shooting and efficient, team-oriented basketball solid-
ified the lead. Davidson shot 44.3 percent from the field and
43.5 percent from behind the three-point stripe. Perhaps more
impressively, the team distributed 23 assists on the 27 made
buckets, the highest total since Jan. 2007 against Wofford.

Scoring 20 points and collecting 10 rebounds to post her fifth
career double-double, Hemerka became only the ath Wildcat
in history to score 1000 points jn her career while leading
Davidson to a 50-40 win at Elon.

Because of the Wildcats’ stellar execution, the closest the
Mountaineers could get to Davidson in the second half was
11 points.

The Wildcats built on this victory to defeat UNCG 70-59.
Alex Thompson ’10 took command in Greensboro, scoring
a personal best 20 points on 5-8 shooting to propel the ’Cats
to their second straight win. She rounded out her stat sheet
with five assists, three steals and three rebounds.

The combined post-performance of Hemerka and
Mercedes Robinson ’09 complimented Thompson’s back-

court production. The pair of Hemerka and Robinson went:

11-19 from the field, tallying 14 and 16 points, respectively.

The game immediately fell into Davidson’s grasp, as the
team took off on a 20-9 mun to open the first half. Three
pointers by Hemerka and Thompson anchored the run, while
the Wildcat defense disrupted the opposition’s rhythm. On
the night, UNCG coughed up 27 turnovers, which Davidson
converted into 28 points.

Davidson’s last challenge in the game came midway
through the second half when the Spartans manufactured a
10-2 run in a three-minute stretch to cut the deficit to 49-42.
Kelsey Cary ’11 stopped the bleeding at the 5:08 mark, and
the duo of Hemerka and Thompson sealed the game with
two sweet strokes from beyond the arc.

On Monday, momentum again prevailed as Davidson
went on the road to defeat Elon 50-40. More impressively,
Hemerka made history by becoming only the eleventh play-
er in school history to score 1000 points in a career. She tal-
lied a season high 20 points and 10 rebounds for the double-
double that solidified her place in the record books.

The game proved exciting throughout, with Elon cutting

the lead to 31-29 at the beginning of the first half, but a 13-
3 run punctuated by Hemerka’s 1000th and 100Ist point
gave Davidson a 44-32 cushion that it would not relinquish.
Tough team defense secured the game, holding Elon to only
26.4 percent shooting from the field.

Davidson’s next game will be at home against Wofford on
Saturday, Jan. 22.
