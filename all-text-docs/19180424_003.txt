SATURDAY NIGHT MEETING.

In the regular meeting of the Phi So-
ciety the query for the debate was. *Re-
solved, ‘That Congress be given a treer
hand in the conduct of the war.”

The affirmative was represented by
Messrs. T. N. Morton and T.
Spence. This was the fourth successive
appearance of Spence before the society,
and his speech was another proof of the
axiom that practice makes perfect. Keep
on practicing.

For the negative. G. McDonald
stated that there were fifteen reasons
why Congress should not be given more

power, but that he would only elaborate!

on one point. ‘Vhe elaboration took ex
actly three minutes, but, by the way,
Mac, what was the point? LL. 1. Wil-
son was the other defender of the present
regime.

H. ‘V. Lilly gave a very interesting
oration on “Phe Manufacture of Shoes.”
C. G. Long gave an excellent declama-
tion entitled, “Under: the Southern
Flag.”

The subject. for the extemporancous
debate was. ‘Resolved, “Vhat drill should
be continued thru exams.” “Phe subject
being one of such vital interest to se
many students caused excellent atten-
tion. ‘The debaters both waxed eloquent
over the subject, giving the society a
treat in oratory, ‘T. R. Alexander spoke
on the affirmative and S. M. Davis was
frequently applauded -for his views on
the negative side of the question.

Subject for debate Saturday. April 20.
was. Resolved, ‘Vhat Congress should
be given a freer hand in the conduct of
the war. The affirmative, composed of
Love. McCaskill and McCloy, in’ the
Fu., argued: First. not to give Con-
gress a freer hand means to centralize
the power and to make the government
more autocratic rather than democratic.
Secondly, to give Congress a freer hand
is a more efficient way than to intrust it
all to one man.

The negative, represented by Mat-
thews, McPheeters and Dendy. argued:
First, giving Congress more power
would impair unity. Secondly, giving
Congress more power would weaken our
national power.

Mitchell gave a declamation entitled.
“The March of the Flag.” Craig gave
a part of “The President's Flag Day
Address.” Liston rendered, ‘‘Iincoln’s
Gettysburg Address.”

HART WINS ESSAY MEDAL.

O. P. Hart has been declared winner
in the Essayists’ Contest in the Philan-
thropic Society. His subject was
“Wanted: A Man." While the thing
wanted is not of the sex most to be de-
sired, still Hart expressed himself well
enough to obtain the honor of the medal.
Dr. Wauchope, of the University of
South Carolina, acted as judge. R. H.
Stone won second place and D. M. Chal-
mers, third.

George King spent the latter part of
last week in the Infirmary with tonsilitis.
He is out again, however, and will be
able to get back into the line-up this
week.
