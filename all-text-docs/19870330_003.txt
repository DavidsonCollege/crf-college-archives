Campus housing situation set for dramatic changes

By NELLE McCORKLE

All freshmen men will not oc-
cupy Belk residence hall during
the 1987-88 academic year, ac-
cording to Director of Residence
Life Tom Jennings. Instead the
three upper floors of Little Dor-
mitory and selected Belk halls will
house freshman men, Jennings
said.

Belk areas designated.
freshman housing are first. west,
second west, third west, second
east, third east, and basement
halls. This arrangement permits
upperclassmen to occupy first east
and fourth floor halls and the
buildings entire center section.

Other planned __ housing
changes include conversion of
Watts third and fourth floors and
Knox second floor to women’s
halls. Sentelle fourth floor, cur-
rently occupiéd by women, will

in the past few years to more re-
cklessness.”

_ Belk physical damages total-
led $2500 during the 1986-87 fall
and winter terms, Jennings esti-
mated. This figure represents a
$1000 increase over the $1500
Belk vandalism fee for the entire
1985-86 academic year. Charges
primarily involve replacement of

ceiling tiles. Unless individuals

claim responsibility for damages,
the Residence Life Office pro-
rates repair costs among residents
of damaged halls. Malicious dam-

age violates the Code of Responsi- _

bility, falls under the Dean of Stu-
dents’ jurisdiction, and can incur
an increased housing lottery
number as anew penalty this year.

Kappa Sigmabids for

By SUSAN PEARSALL

Members of the Kappa Sigma
Interest Group presented a peti-._
tion for recognition as a fraternity
at a meeting of the Council on
Campus and Religious Life Mon-
day, Mar. 23. The petition, signed
by 64 students committed to join
Kappa Sig if Dean Terry and the-
C.C.R.L. decide to reinstate the
Delta Chapter at Davidson, will
be voted on next Monday. If
reinstated, Kappa Sig would try to
begin eating as a fraternity next
fall in the Emanon or ATO house.

The petition, penned by pro-
spective Kappa Sigs with the help
of representatives from. Kappa
Sigmas’s National Headquarters,

was, according to a member of the

Interest Group’s Executive Com- —

mittee, Conrad Doenges, “‘a state-
ment of who we are, what we’ve
done, and what we plan to do.”
The students in the Interest Group
wanted to form a fraternity and not
an all-male eating house because,
explained Doenges, “.. . the
fraternity system has heen siting
in succeeding financially. We'd
fit right into the existing. fraternity
organization. We also have
alumni support [for a fraternity]
since there used to.be a Kappa Sig
here.”

As a group, Kappa Sig hope-
fuls, generally sophomores and
freshmen, are optimistic about

“I’ve seen a trend

complaints by the College’s vend-
ing contractor, according to Di-
rector of Auxiliary Services,
Carlton Pritchard.

_ Vandalism appears confined
to all male dormitories, Jennings
noted. “Our main reason for this
housing shift is the damage and re-
‘sponsibility issues . . . . Women
don’t seem to have those kinds of
problems,” he said.

Jennings explained the
rationale for planned housing
shifts: Knox dormitory possesses
an exterior door combination
lock, unlike Sentelle and Little
dormitories. “We want to have as
many women as we can in build-
ings with locks on the door,” Jen-
nings said.

Asked about the housing
changes’ possible consequences
for freshman class unity, Dean of
Students Will Terry said, “I cer-
tainly believe in freshman class
unity, but I think there are other
ways we can achieve that.” Jen-
nings said, “I think there will still
be freshman class unity because
we're putting large’ chunks of

people in Little and Belk.”

Diffusion of freshman men
within upperclass dormitories
may produce greater calm, Terry
said, “I have a hope that doing this
may enable upperclassmen to
make the dorms more civilized
and less noisy,” he said.

Jennings stressed the housing
change’'s potential for heightened
academic concentration. He said,
“I know our upperclass students
are committed enough ‘to their
academics to want to live in a
place that has a more academic en-
vironment, We hope they instill
that in the freshmen.”

Dispersal of freshman men’s

halls within upperclass. housing
may tighten freshman men’s hall
identity, Jennings said. He ex-
pects heightened intramural athle-
tic competition.
Jennings also noted opportu-
nity for increased fraternity influ-
ence: “There’s potential for frater-
nities to use that accessibility of a
shared dormitory as an environ-
ment for rushing.”

Jennings emphasized _ that

freshman halls will remain intact
within upperclassman housing.
Physically, Little residence halls
are sharply defined, unlike Belk’s
U-shaped floor plan. “It’s hard to
feel a sense of the individual hall
when you're on a floor of 80
people,” Jennings said.

Both Jennings and Terry noted
the housing shifts’ experimental

-nature. The planned changes

emerged from February's faculty/
staff retreat suggestions; Jennings
drafted a specific proposal ap-
proved by Terry.

Long-range housing plans in-
corporate construction of a new
dormitory. Tentative locations to
be discussed at the May Board of
Trustees meeting include the
Lingle Manor area adjacent to
Richardson dormitory and the .
land immediately east of Knox
dormitory, Jennings said. Eventu-
ally perimeter houses will revert
to office space and faculty hous-
ing: “We'll keep the perimeter
houses as student housing until
new housing is built,” Jennings
said.

Doenges said the housing situ-
ation is another issue the SGA will
have to face. He said the SGA will
attempt to communicate student
complaints to appropriate offi-
| cials. He also argued that more
support should be given to club
and intermural sports, saying they
were a “crucial outlet for student
involvement” but that they often
get bypassed in funding by the ad-
ministration.

with the housing problem with the
formation of a housing committee
and conducting a student survey.
She argued that the situation is one
“that can change” and that the
SGA needs to “push the issue.”
She also stated that the SGA’s
biggest problem is that it doesn’t
do enough with its resources and
said that student involvement with
ideas would be helpful in this
area.

his sophomore year and was co-
chairman of this year’s career
symposium. He is a junior history

in pep band, wind ensemble and

potential.

Basketball Coach Bobby Hussey

that he feels the building and new

program more than any other
single thing I can recall.”

phasized that because the retracta-

will serve as an all-purpose gym

means of utilizing that space.

about the future prospects of the

Will Kappa Sigma be ac-
cepted by the rest of Patterson
Court if it does, in fact, become
Davidson’s seventh fraternity?
Dunn Hollingsworth, member of
SAE, believes so: “I think it’s a
good move to see another frater-
nity arriving on campus. I think
most other ‘fraternity men’ would
feel the same way, because it

would be another pro-fraternity —

voice on the councils, and it
would provide another alternative
for freshmen.”
Doug Hicks agrees: “Kappa Sig

guys in other fraternities. I think

Aycock, SAE pledge, claims that
the need for another fraternity is
obvious: “Look at how many in-
dependents there were last year. If
that’s where they fit in, that’s
great!” However, some Patterson
Court members, who wish not to
be identified, believe that antoher
fraternity is simply not needed at
Davidson.

Potential Kappa Sigs feel that
Kappa Sigma offers. them some-
thing that the other fraternities
don’t have. “It offered a different
atmosphere from the other
frats — one where you could re-
ally make good friends and have
fun,” says freshman Hill Harris.
