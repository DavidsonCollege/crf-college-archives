Local Battalion
of Highest

For the third consecutive year the U. S
War Department has seen fit to inspect the
Reserve Officers’
Davidson College. The past two years saw
Davidson placed on: the Distinguished Rating

list, last year she taking the honor of having |

the highest average of the South.

In 1926 Davidson won Distinguished Rat-
ing ‘with an efficiency percentage of 89.5
per cent.” In 1927 the percentage was raised
to 92.43 per cent. This was the highest rat-
ing given to any school in the Fourth Corps
Area, which includes North and South Caro-
lina, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Flor-
ida and Tennessee. Of the 15 schools
recommended for the inspection only six re-
ceived the coveted honor. They were: Cita-
del, Clemson, Florida, Auburn, Mississippi A.
& M., and Davidson.

The rating is made on a 100 per cent basis.
The work is divided into three distinct minor
phases which is, in turn sub?divided into
minor phases each of which counts a certain
per ce nttoward making up the 100 per cent.
The following is a table showing the percent-
ages used last year:

GENERAL BOWLEY POSSIBLY
TO RETURN TO THIS STATE

General Bowley will probably return to
North Carolina, announces an_ editorial
writer of the Charlotte Observer. General
Bowley was recent commander of Fort
Bragg, North Carolina, from which place he
was transferred to Fort Sam Houston, Tex.
In his position as commander of Bragg, Gen-
eral Bowley came into contact with several
Davidson men who attended camp at that
place. He has been a guest of the local

'1R. O. T. C. unit at several occasions and has

spoken to the battalion.

North Carolina evidently has laid a claim
upon the heart of the General and it is the
belief of The Observer that August will
find him back in the Piedmont section. What
his occupation will be upon his return was
not announced.

breakable toy you gave Dick for his

NO PAPER NEXT WEEK

Due to the Easter holidays there will
be no issue of The Davidsonian next
week. Since the paper is made up on
Monday night and sent to the publish-
ers the next day there will not be suf-
ficient time to assemble the copy and
send it to press so as to come out on
the appointed day. This issue con-
cludes the regime of the present staff,
and with the next issue the paper will
be taken over by the new staff as an-
nounced in another column of this pa-
per. The next issue will be on April
19th.

MODERN PHILOSOPHY

Following is an excerpt of an article}
written by Prof. B. Blanshard, of Swarth- |
more College and circulated for the pur-
pose of stimulating interest in
scholarships.

Oxford offers greater opportunities for

the study of philosophy. than any other |

university in the world.

There are several reasons for this fact. |

For one thing, philosophy holds the cen-

tral place in the course which, by general |
consent, shows the Oxford tradition at its |
best, the course in Literae Humaniores or |

“greats.”
of Greek and Latin civilization.

is feeble, it often looks like a course in
Classics; to the Englishman who brings
to its study a reading knowledge of the
two languages, everything else is inciden-
tal to the mastery of ancient thought. He
reads the Republic through in Greek, and
tops it off with Aristotle’s Ethics; then
with the intellectual muscle produced by
this somewhat heavy gymnastic, he goes
on to a rapid tour of moral philosophy and
a strong-winded plunge into logic. This
is the kind of work which in Oxford
leads to a B.A., and the American who
wants a typically Oxonian. regimen
well advised to take it. But if it seems
to bristle too thickly with{elassics, he has
an excellent alternative before him. Most
Americans and many Englishmen have
felt a little reluctant to spend so much
time on the ancients, and in answer to
the increasing demand, Oxford has es-
tablished a “modern greats” which at-
temps for the modern period what the
traditional course does for the ancient.
This new course covers history, economics

Apart from the central place of phil-

are three other factors that make it

who has tried, you can’t learn philosophy
from lectures, from the process that
Carlyle described as sitting like a pitcher
and being pumped into. You learn to
think as you learn to run, by trying and
being coached; and that is the Oxford no-
tion of teaching. You are given a tutor
or supervisor for whom you write fre-
quent papers, and you must discuss and
defend these productions in the privacy of
his room. Directly confronted with a
practiced mind, you soon find your hidden
failings of manner and matter coming
painfully but most instructively to light.
