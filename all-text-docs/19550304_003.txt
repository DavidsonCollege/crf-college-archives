LADY LUCK SCOWLS AGAIN

Lady Luck turned up again in Davidson’s basketball for-
tunes this week, and as it has been this season, Dame Fortune
gave nothing to the Wildcats except bad news. This time, the
peculiarities of conference play pitted the Cats against the
country’s No, 13 team. George Washington, and the Colonials
thrashed the Davidson club in the opening round of the con-
ference tournament in Richmond.

This year’s edition of the Wildcats has seen little of the
good luck side. With a tremendous lack of height to start
with, the first slash came when Gaylord Walker, big soph
center, left school at the semester due to scholastic trouble.
Improvement of frosh players like Mike Martin and Lew
Spears was seen as the answer to the problem, and these two
hustlers got in their share of the rebounds. This reserve
strength helped the club, and things temporarily looked bet-
ter, but then Lady Luck turned thumbs down again. Martin
and Spears were both injured, with Martin out for the season.

The biggest stab of all came three weeks ago when Hobby
Cobb broke one of his fingers in practice. The incident oc-
curred on the day before the Cats traveled to Greenville to
meet Furman, and Cobb played the game with the finger
evidently bothering his shooting accuracy. The next morning,
the doctor informed him that what he thought was a jammed
finger was a broken one. Orders were to stay off the court
for the rest of the season. So the Cats played their last three
games minus their leading scorer, and managed to win only
one. At 5-11, Dave Shaw became the country’s shortest center,
and with one exception, the Cats had no one over 6-4 in the
line-up.

That brings us up to date, and the game at Richmond last
night completed Lady Luck’s medicine for Davidson. The
74-86 massacre put the Cats out of the tourney and ended a
mediocre season.

There were some nice points about the season, too. The
Cats slaughtered Guilford in a pair of contests, gaining re-
venge for an opening night loss last year. The first three
Southern Conference games provided either wins or exciting
games, with the last minute loss to V.P.I. being judged as the
toughest decision the Cats took all year. With Cobb out of
the line-up, it took an all-out effort to beat Catawba’s Indians,
and fans witnessed an exciting over-time contest which saw
Ray Harding and Ish Bennet burn the nets up in the final

five minutes.

Now the eternal cry of “Wait Until Next Year” starts
again, and if a good crop of freshmen players turn up next
year, with a little height to go with the fine crew of small
players already here, Davidson will be getting revenge on a
a lot of teams.

ENSIGN WINS FINAL CONTEST

The Davidsonian’s first season of “Pickin’ the Winners”
came to a close this week, and Jim Ensign was the final winner
in the contest which was held over a five-week period. Ensign
only missed three guesses out of fifteen attempts to take
down the top spot. Carl Jackson was runner-up with only four
misses. All winners of the contest receive passes to the Caro-
lina Theatre in Charlotte.

GW Was Too Powerful:
Harding Tops Cat Scoring

Davidson's Wildcats bowed out of the Southern Confer-
ence Tournament in the first round last night as the George
Washington Colonials proved too tough for the Cats and came
out with an easy 74-36 win. Corky Delvin and Joe Holup paced
a second-half attack that subdued the Cats, after the Davidson

club had stayed within firing range during the first half.

Tennis Schedule Is
Given by McKee;
Practice Under Way

« Sy GOB PULLIAM

The 1955 edition of the David-
son College tennis team began
workouts this week and Coach Dick
McKee has released the schedule
for this season. The season will
begin with the ‘annual spring tour,
during which the Cats will play
four strong Florida teams. Out-
standing among these teams are
the University of Miami, University
of Florida, and Rollins, considcred
by many to be among the best
teams in the nation.

The Cats, who were last year's
Southern Conference champions,
are expected to again have a strong
team, having lost only two of the
first eight men from last year's
team. Back are Lacy Keesler,
Southern Conference singles
champ, and George Snead and
Corky Clarke, doubles champions.
With some help from last year’s
freshman team and possibly this
year's freshmen the Cats may
again be considered as one of
the better teams in the confer-
ence.

The schedule consists of twenty-
three matches, beginning with the
spring trip on March the 17th.
Strong teams featured on the
schedule in addition to those al-
ready mentioned are: North Caro-
lina, Presbyterian, which features
nationally known Allan Morris,
and Michigan State.

Coach Danny Miller's crew
played a stalling game in the first

half, waiting to get a good shot] §

before firing it up. It slowed the
George Washington attack, and at
halftime the score read: George
Washington 30, Davidson 18. When
the second half began, Davidson
started to play a running game,
and the Colonials promptly ran
the score up easily. Coach Miller
used the entire team in the contest
as did George Washington.

Devlin and Holup each got 18
points to lead the GW scoring,
while Ray Harding paced Davidson
with 12. The Colonials are ranked
as favorites in. the tourney despite
their No. 2 seeding. They meet
Richmond tonight in one bracket
of the semi-finals, while West Vir-
ginia meets Washington and Lee
in the other.

Spring Practice Finishes;
Varsity Rated as Favorite

“Old Man Football,” the king of sports, returns to the
Davidson campus tomorrow afternoon at 2:15 p.m., when the
Davidson Varsity hits the Alumni “Oldtimers” squad in the
first Davidson Alumni-Varsity game. The game marks the end
of Davidson’s spring practice sessions, and Coach Bill Dole
will show his upperclassmen of 1955 to fans for the first time.

Practice sessions for the Varsity
have eased up just a bit in the
last few days as the Cats have
been tapering off in preparation
for the scrap tomorrow. The David-
son club has worked into top
shape, and the efforts of the coach-
ing staff will probably be well-
rewarded.

The “Oldtimers” are scheduled
to hold their last practice tonight,

The 1985 Davidson College tank- after having had several here and

men ended their season last week-
end when they participated in the
Southern Conference champion-
ship held here at Davidson.

The championship was won b:
Virginia Military Institute, which
successfully defended its crown.
The Southern Conference cham-
pions scored a record 169 points
and won 9 of the 13 events. The
168-point total broke the old team

in Charlotte. The alumni squad
roster is filled with ex-Cat stars,
some of whom will be donning the
pads for the first time in about
five years. Many are still in ex-
cellent shape, and the collegians
may have a battle on their hands.
Dick O'Hair and Bill Iverson, two
top-flight ends, will probably start
and will do a lot of grabbing for

Davidson Grapplers
At Lexington For
Conference Mee!

Coach Charlie Parker’s wrestling
team is in Lexington, Virginia, this
weekend for the annual Southern
Conference Wrestling Meet, and
Wildeat Captain Johnny Buxton
will be the major Davidson threat
to bring back one of the cham-
pions’ trophies. Buxton placed
third in last year's meet, and this
year finds the chances very good
that he will finish in the top spot.

The meet opened with first
round matches being held today,
and the finals will be held tomor-
row night. The meet wil] be single
elimination style with two unde-
feated matters meeting in the final
round of each weight division.

JERRY SPEAKS:

Babbling Brooks.

This week I would like to do something a little bit different.
I would like to devote this column to one man. This athlete
is a short-haired Yankee, who has fondly been called “the

‘|machine,” by close friends, he is more widely known as Pete.

Peter Richard Ashcraft is a
sophomore from Amherst, Mass.,|~~
who has come to Davidson as a
blessing to Coach Whittle's need
for an outstanding distance man.

The list of Pete's victories and
accomplishments is practically
endless. Last year he set a new|(’
freshman cake race record which
may stand for years to come. He, -
earned two trophies and a medal
from this past crosscountry sea-
son and was named on the All-
Southern Conference cross-country
team.

However, no matter how fine
these accomplishments are, great-
er things were yet to come. Two
weeks ago, when everyone in town
was tearing loose during the Mid-
winters festivities, a small expedi-
tion of track men ventured to the
Southern Conference Indoor Track
Meet at Lexington, Va. With only
seven men, Davidson attained a
third place position and a team
total of twenty points .. . ten of
which Pete won. i

Pete won the mile run in slow
time and thought that he might
like to audit the two-mile run
just to see how well he could do.
If things weren't going too well,
he was to drop out and save him-
self for the mile relay. At one
time midway in the race Coach
Whittle was ready to pull him out,
but Pete was possessed with the
idea of winning. He maintained his
steady pace while most of the
pacers dropped out. Finally, with
two laps to go, Pete went out in
front and stayed there. A remark-
able evening, but even more re-
markable when one stops to realize
that Pete had not run that distance
since cross-country season and was
eyidently not considered to be in
condition for a two-mile run.

Now we come ‘to the final case
