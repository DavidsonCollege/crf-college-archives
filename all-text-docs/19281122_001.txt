DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C., NOVEMBER 22, 1928

STATE GLEE CLUB |
MEET TO BE HELD
AT DURHAM DEC.6

Davidson Organization is Pre-
paring for Contest

STATE TOUR ARRANGED

Duke, N. C. State, and Guilford
Will Also Participate in Meet

After much delay, it has been announc-
ed by the state officers that there will be
a State Glee Club contest this year. This
contest is to be held in Durham on De-
cember 6, with four colleges being repre-
sented. They are Duke, State, Davidson
and Guilford.

The contest song is to be “Songs My
Mother Taught Me,” by Dvorak. There
will also be another song which each club
will select for itself. Davidson's Club
will probably use “Sylvia” as their other
song.

It will be remembered that the Duke
Club last year topped Davidson's Club by
less than half a point to win first place.
Professor Cullum and the officers of the
Glee Club are not saying much about
what they think are Davidson’s chances
this year, but it is evident enough that
‘they are planning on being second to none.

Around the State Contest will be cen-
tered the fall Glee Club trip. Leaving
here about noon on Monday, December 3,
they will go to Troy, where they will give
a program that night, sponsored by the
Troy Parent Teachers’ Association. On
Tuesday the club will go to Red Springs,
where they will give a matinee at Flora
Macdonald College at 3:00 o'clock, being
sponsored by the Senior Class there.
Leaving immediately after the matinee,
they will arrive in Elizabethtown in time
to give a concert there that night. Wed-
nesday night the club will give a concert
in Fayetteville and then on to Durham
Thursday for the State Contest. The club
will return to Davidson shortly after the
concert.

Manager Abernathy announced that the
club would also probably stop at several
high schools along the route during school
hours and give half-hour programs. He
also stated that the churches in every
town in which the club is to stop over
night for a concert had willingly pledged
their co-operation and support by offering
to provide entertainment for the club in
the homes of the church members. Some
30 men will make this trip and, as usual,
the club will charter a special bus in
which to travel.

JACKSON SPEAKS AT
‘Y’ VESPER SERVICES

Discusses Evils of Life of Idle-
‘ness and Self-Satisfaction

“The smugly complacent, self-satisfied
way of life is the way of tragedy,” de-
clared Rev. James W. Jackson, pastor of
the First Presb¥terian Church of Green-
wood, S. C,, at “Y” vespers in Shearer
Hall Sunday evening.

The eleventh chapter of Luke’s Gospel,
containing the account of the sleepy house-
holder aroused late at night by a neighbor
seeking to borrow bread, was the scrip-
tural basis for the speaker’s message. The
fact that the neighbor succeeded because
of his importunity was stressed by Jesus
that His people might be persevering in
prayer.

Yet it is interesting and instructive to
look at this incident from the point of
view of the man in bed. . “Tréuble me
not,” or “Don’t bother me,” was his reply
when called upon to serve.

We cannot overlookthe fact that this
attitue of indifference is quite as preva-
lent today as it was in the time of Jesus.
Laziness, indecision, and self-satisfaction
are powerful factors in preventing the de-
velopment of the highest character in
manhood.

There are many reasons why people

take this attitude of “Don’t bother me.” |

Interference with money-making as in the
case of the Gardarenes, upsetting old tra-
ditional ideas and customs as at Caper-
naum, opposition to governmental crook-
edness of Herod, and decrying the racial
prejudice of the Samaritans caused all
these people to take this position toward
Jesus’ teachings.

In modern life we are so coddled by the
comforts of home that we are afraid to
accept a great challenge when it comes to
us lest it cause us to suffer a little hard~
ship. The tragedies of twentieth century
life-are not caused by the “bad people”
but by those not quite good enough to live
a real dynamic Christian life. ;

Then, too, the divorcing of the forehead

Campaign For Dress

Funds to be Raised by Personal
Contributions from Faculty,

Recognizing the need for dress uni-
forms for the R. O..T. C. Band, Capt.
John W. Elkins has launched a drive
to procure sufficient funds to equip
that organization.with full dress. The
fund for this purpose is to be raised by
personal contribution from the fac-
ulty, the Davidson-Cornelius and the
Mooresville Posts of the American
Legion, the student body and any oth-
ers who wish to contribute to the
cause.

Letters have been mailed to individ-
uals and many of them have been re-
turned with checks attached. Capt.
Elkins expects to close the campaign
soon with enough cash to purchase an
entire uniform for the drum major and
capes for each member of the band.
The’ entire amount necessary to com-
plete the equipment will be $900 but
this total will not be raised immedi-
ately.

It is hopedsby, those in charge that
when, approached, the student body
will donate generously to the fund
since dress uniforms will enhance the
band at all public appearances, lend
appreciably to all athletic engage-
ments, and be a source of pride to the
college,

Chameleon Editors
Plan Poetry Edition
About Thanksgiving

Poetry Will Be Stressed More in
Next Issue Than in Past

The next issue of the Chameleon will
appear on or about Thanksgiving. As
this will be the last issue of the magazine
before the Christmas holidays, the editors
are bending every effort to make it one
which will be entirely satisfactory, and
one which will meet with the approval of
the students.

For the last three years it has been the
policy to change the color of the magazine
at each publication. There were no book
reviews in the first issue of the Chame-
leon, and a’ change will be, made by the
editorial staff to include these reviews in
the next edition. Three or four of the
most recent and widely read books will he

BRILLIANT FUTURE SEEN

Dr. C. K. Brown Leads Students
and Alumni in Tribute to Dead

Immediately following the R. O. T. C.
parade Saturday morning, Davidson
alumni’ and students assembled in the
stadium for the feature address of Home-
coming Day, delivered by Col. A. L. Gas-
ton, prominent jurist of Chester, S. C.

Rey. John McSween, president of Pres-
byterian College of South Carolina, and
an alumnus of Davidson, presided over
the exercises. Returning Davidson grad-
uates were welcomed to the campus by Dr.
W. J. Martin, president.

Tribute to Dead

An impressive moment ofthe program
was the tribute to Davidson men who have
died during the past year. Dr, C. K,
Brown, of the Davidson faculty, was in
charge.

Colonel Gaston said that “Davidson Col-
lege has rendered an outstanding service
in the development of the best Christian
manhood of the nation, Under the leader-
ship of Dr. W. J. Martin, and with a mag
nificent faculty and student body, David-
son is destined to a greater sphere of
usefulness and greatness.” :

Pure Americans
brief historical sketch of the
founding and settling of this «section cf
the South, Colonel Gaston expressed deep
satisfaction resulting from the great num-
ber of keen intellects and strong leaders
which have developed here. ‘No influx of
new and untried people has forced its way
into our midst and no large foreign popu-
lations has had to be absorbed to form an
undigestible mixture. We are purely as
American as can be found in any section
oféthe country, and as hardy and brave
as those sturdy men who founded James-
town in 1607, ere the Pigrim fathers had
sought the inviting shores in the far-
famed and much-sung Mayflower.”

As a heritage of this type of men, Da-
vidson College may look forward to 4 fu-
ture of greatness, according to Colonel
Gaston, and will be called upon to assume
the leadership in the progress and ad-
vancement of education in this and other
parts of the country.

KELL STARS FOR ’CATS

Before a Homecoming Day Crowd es-
timated at 7,000, a light but fighting Red
and Black machine went down in glorious
defeat before and stronger
from University of North
Carolina. For nearly three-quarters of the
game the Wildcats out-fought and out-
played the Tar Heels in practically every
department, but an aerial attack opened
in the third quarter proved too much.

Carolina won the toss-up and chose to
receive. The kick-off was returned to
their 36-yard line and the ball was soon
advanced into Davidson territory by ‘the
hammering line drives of Nash, House
and Ward, Then that thin red line dis-
played those sterling fighting qualities that
were successful in halting the advance of
the rival backs when they attempted to
plow through the line.

The second period opened with the ball
in Carolina's Davidson’s
10-yard line. Here the Tar Heels flashed
a passing attack that after four plays re-
sulted in the first touchdown of the day.

Kell, outstanding star ‘of the game,
again covered himself with glory by his
excellent generalship, running and passing.
Receiving the kick-off after the touch-
down 19-yard line, Kel’
returned it 20 yards to the 29-yard line.
Failing here to make any gain through
the stalwart Carolina line, Davidson also
resorted to the air and Kell heaved a pass
to Brock that was good for 13 yards. This
proved a tonic for the ‘Cats, and line
drives by Kell, Flinn and Brohard, and
another pass, Kell to Flinn, gave another
first down.

The ball was now on Carolina’s 32-yard
line, and the stands were pleading for a
touchdown. Kell again stepped into the
limelight when he ripped through the line
for another six yards; this was followed
by a beautiful pass to Brock which netted
15 yards. With the oval now on the 10-
yard line, Kell got five and Flinn and
Brohard made one each. Then the stands
went wild as another pass from Kell to
