Professor Beasley '82 returns to teach where she once learned

By Krisy Ford

Sara Beasley has returned to
Davidson, but this time her role is
reversed. No longer is she sitting
in a desk frantically jotting down
notes as most students do; she is
the one givingthem. A1986 gradu-
ate of Davidson, Beasley has re-
turned this year as a visiting pro-
fessor in the English department.

Upon enrollment at Davidson
in 1982, Professor Beasley knew
that she wanted to be an English
major. “English was something I
always hada great enthusiasm for,”
said Beasley. “It was something I
cared about, so I always strived to
dowellinit.” She always wanted
to be a teacher, but it wasn’t until

her sophomore year at Davidson
that she decided she wanted to be a
college professor.

After graduation she contin-
ued her studies at the University of
Pennsylvania. Her specialty is
English Renaissance Drama and
even more specifically, Revenge
Tragedy.

She claims that her interest in
this area began her junior year while
taking a class with Professor
Cynthia Lewis. :

“I wrote a paper in that class
and became so obsessed with the
concept of revenge tragedy and
why the Greeks found it so inter-
esting. After that I was hooked,”
said Beasley.

In her spare time she loves to
read. Her favorite author is Jeanette
Winterson. Beasley loves the Brit-
ish author’s wittiness. and is im-
pressed with the fact that Winterson
has published several books and is
just a few years older than she.

Although fiction and female
Southern writers are her favorites,
she enjoys drama from all periods.

Beasley is also a big sports
fan. She tunes in to baseball and
basketball games as well as par-
ticipating in some sports of her
own suchas biking. “Ialsolike to
listen to music, but my taste is
somewhat diverse,” says Beasley.
She listens to anything from alter-
native to classical to rock-n-roll.

Some of her favorites are the Judy
Batts, K.D. Lang, and REM.

Whenasked why she returned
to Davidson, Beasley responded:
“It was an excellent opportunity. I
feel like I received an excellent
education here and now it is my
goal to give back all of the same
effort that was shown to me.

“When I was a student here, I
knew the professors were smart
and worked really hard, but now
that I am in their shoes, Ican really
appreciate it.”

Beasley was always very in-
spired by the time put in-by her
teachers and the knowledge they
possessed. “What I’m really try-
ing to do is be accessible to my

students.” This semester she is
teaching American Literature,
Freshman Composition, and
Shakespeare.

“Some of my old professors
have said that it makes them feel
old because I am back here as a
professor. Actually, I feel old be-
cause so much has happened and
changed since I was here.” Beasley
feels a special attachment towards
Davidson because it is “kind, gen-
erous, and I get a good sense from
the whole place.”

After completing her year
here, Professor Beasley hopes to
obtain a tenure track position at
another college, preferably in the
South.

With Norton in semi-retirement, Raeford's is the place for a haircut.

Raeford's replaces Norton's

By Lexy Devane

When Norton’s Barber Shop
closed last Spring, many students
believed an era had ended. No
longer could the tradition of get-
ting “Nortonized” be an integral
part of the male freshman experi-
ence.

With the opening of Raeford’s
Barber Shop on Main Street, stu-
dents’ hopes of having a-quality,
old fashioned hair cut have been
rekindled.

Raeford’s Barber Shop opened
officially to the public on October
4th. The shop is owned by James

~ Raeford who has beén cutting hair

for 30 years. Two other barbers,
Ken Norton, with 51 years experi-
ence, and Joe McClain, with 40
years experience, also work part

Workshop aims to help students deal

By Mandy Curtis

Students who procrastinate are
not alone in their traumas to get
papersin on time ortostudy enough
for an exam.

The Student Counseling cen-
ter sees many students over the
year with the same symptoms of
anxiety and stress related to their
habitual practice of procrastinat-

ing.

For this reason, the Student
Counseling service will be spon-
soring a workshop, “To do, or not
to do: Dealing with Procrastina-
tion,” on Thursday, October 28 at
8:30 p.m. in the Carolina Inn.

Student counselors Dr. DeWitt
Crosby and Dr. David Staton will
be hosting the lecture and helping
students to recognize their indi-
vidual problems with procrastina-

tical ways of avoiding the univer-
sal causes.

According to Crosby and
Staton, students usually have the
biggest problems when papers are
due.

They explain that a common
attitude is “why do today what you
can do tomorrow.”

With this reoccurring ratio-
nale, “tension builds” and the stu-
dents find themselves staying up
all night to finish a paper due the
next day.

Anxiety, stress and shame are

’ some of the emotions related to

procrastination, say Crosby and
Staton. They feel that if more
students recognized their indi-
vidual problems, they might be
able to help themselves before it is
too late.

Staton recalled.a time when a
student came to him in the coun-
seling center on the last day of

_ exams of the second semester to

say that “he thought he had a prob-
lem with procrastination.” The
irony of the situation is that the
student was a senior.

Procrastination can be a de-
bilitating problem for many stu-
dents; learning how to deal with
the habit can help deter the action,
according to the student counse-
lors.

With a full time staff in the
Student Counseling center, the
counselors plan to hold more work-

- sheps-throughout the-year.--- - - -

time.

The shop is open Monday,
Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday
from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., Saturday 8
a.m. to 5 p.m., and is closed on
Wednesday and Sunday. The cost
of a regular cut is $6.00, while a
flat-top is $6.25.

“In the last two weeks, we
have had a very successful open-
ing. I think it is because of our
good location near the school and
because we give good cuts,” stated
Raeford. “Kids go to other places
and get their hair styled. Then they
come to us because we give a good
conservative cut. There is a degree
of styling but mostly we cut hair
the good old-fashioned way.”

The promise of a good old
fashioned hair cut is taken seri-
ously at Raeford’s. The Barbers
use straight razors, as opposed to
safety razors, and actually shave
the person’s face and neck.

The actual haircuts are only
altered slightly from the styles
popular with Davidson alumni
throughout the years. Even the shop
itself is stocked with tradition in-
cluding four inviting barber chairs
for clients to relax in.

Sophomore Rhett Ingerick
says, “Raeford’s Barber Shop is
my last hope for some sort of tradi-
tion outside of actual school. With
the close of Norton’s and Bacon
and Eggs last year, I was very
disillusioned because institutions
of Davidson’sunique culture were
dying. At least now I don’t have to
go to Supercuts.”

“Raeford’s is a convenient,
affordable place to get your hair-
cut,” says sophomore Scott Ellis.
“It is a nice place with nice people
working there who will give you a

good conservative, no frills cutwell —

worth the price.”

Women's
self-selection
system faces
changes

By Carrie Blackburn

Because the size of member-
ship in the women’s eating houses
varies drastically, plans have been —
made to address this discrepancy.

In the past, freshwomen could
choose a house for social purposes
even if they could not eat there.

- Waiting lists also existed for each

house.

Now, however, prospective
members must list the three houses
Warner Hall, Connor and Rusk in
order of preference.

Because waiting lists have
been abolished, a computer will
try to place an even number of
women per house.

Patterson Court Advisor Kurt
Holmes explains the necessity for
change “to keep the houses from
fluctuating and to slow down the
cycle of up and down.”

Although this new proposal
does not guarantee that everyone
will get the house of her choice,
many seem optimistic about the
revision. “I definitely think we
need it. We need three houses and
we need the numbers in all the
houses. I think it will work,” com-
ments Kathy Oakes, vice president
of Rusk.

Sarah Goldsmith, vice presi-
dent of Warner Hall, an eating
house which will greatly benefit
from added members, echoes this
feeling: “I like the spirit infused
this year with self-selection with
trying to unify all the women’s
houses but also recognizing each —
house’s uniqueness.”
