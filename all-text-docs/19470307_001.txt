No. 16

Pan Hell May Change

Constitution Faults

Changes In Constitution Pro-
posed by Pan-Hellenic
Council
On Thursday, March 13, each of
the social fraternities of Davidson
wilt vote on an amendment to the
Constitution and. By-Laws of the
Pan-Hellenic Council of major im-
portance to fraternity men in par-
ticular and to all Davidson men in
general. At that time the fraterni-
ties will laso vote upon the addi-
tion of a fifth section to the Con-
stitution. The amendment and the
addition of these two sections will
be made to the Ninth Article of the
Pan-Hellenic Constitution which is
concerned with the responsibilities
of the Pan-Hellenic Council in re-

‘gard to college dances.

Amendment

Section three, to be altered by the
proposed amendment, reads at pres-
ent as follows: “The signatory
chapters agree to underwrite with
their representatives all Council
dances, the Council and the several
chapters to assume fifty per cent
of the risk, respectively. In event
of loss, fifty per cent of the net
loss will be prorated among the
chapters, the remaining fifty per
cent among their representatives.
In case of gain, net profit shall be
divided in the same manner.”

As stated above, each fraternity
at present assumes fifty per cent
of all losses or gains incurred by
the Pan-Hellenic Council through
the presentation of school dances
during the fiscal year, which ends
on May 15.

However, since this measure does

not allow the Council any means
of estimating the amount of money
that will be available to cover the
expenses of an approaching dance,
an amendment to this section has
been outlined for the consideration
of the fraternities. This aleration
will allow the Council to know be-
forehand, and prepare accordingly,
exactly how much money can be
allotted to each of the various ex-
the
preparation of any dance, such as

penses that must be met in
the type of band, decorations, spon-
sors’ flowers, and number of tickets
to be printed, to mention a few.

Gambling Eliminated

The suggested amendment which
would eliminate the present method
of guess work in providing for
these expenses, is as follows: Sec-
tion 3. The signatory chapters
agree to underwrite all Council
dances, sharing equally in all new
profit or loss. The chapters will be
responsible individually for the pur-
chase of set tickets to each set of
dances by at least 85 per cent of
its enrollment, including pledges.
In the event a lesser number of
tickets is purchased by the enroll-
ment of any chapter, that chapter |
shalk pay to the Council, prior to}
the dances involved,.an amount
equal to the difference between the
value of the required number and
those actually purchased.

Frats To Vote

In order that this amendment be-
come part of the Constitution, Pan-
Hellenic regulations require that
three-fourths of the fraternities on
the campus must pass it.

Also, in order to provide a check |

on Pan-Hellenic expenditures, the
additioh of a fifth section has been
presented so that the fraternities
may vote on it at the same time.
It is as follows: Section 5. A
board _of examiners, consisting of.
the President and one other member
who is not the Pan-Hellenic repre-
sentative from each fraternity shall
inspect the books of the Pan-Hel-
lenic Council by May 15 of each
fiscal year, and at any other time

By. Hugh Hill

As Told to Dave Richardson

Realizing at last the value of
compulsory vespers which are a
sacred tradition within the hallowed
walls of Davidson from the infinite
store of strength provided recently
by the sight of service
which brought little thoughts of |
gladness to the hearts of all those}
present at the service, the David-
sonian has decided to adopt a policy
approved by the college and recount
each week the harrowing experi- |

which many had part,

and as a result of especial valor,
was graciously awarded a_three-
day pass to Biarritz for a well-
earned rest.

Arriving at the resort town re-
splendent in the sartorial excellence
of a conservative brown holiday

making friends with the inhabi-
tants, passing out candy bars
thoughtfully to those he deemed
most worthy of affection, and be-
stawing smiles indiscriminately on
all sides,

After returning to his room to

shoulders of the adoring crowd to
the town, hall, where he was kissed
on both khaki-clad cheeks by the
mayor, received the key to Biarritz,
and quieted the tumultuous cheers
only by modestly admitting that it
was nothing.

Election Dope

In an exclusive release to the
Davidsonian, Hill indicated that the
most interesting part-of the experi-
ence was the fast friendship which
he struck up with a little German
boy, the brother of the deceased
girl. When Hugh’ left Europe, the
little _urchinweepingly presented
him a basket of fruit, and last
Christmas Hill sent his friend a
basket of food.

Bill McLean, president of the stu-
dent body, stated however, that ab-
sentee ballots would not be counted
in the coming spring elections,

Announcement Made
For Summer Session

Davidsons’ will
begin on June 5 for those students
who take eight-hour and four-hour
laboratory courses in science, and
students taking six-hour and three-
hour courses in other subjects will
begin classes on June 11. Both of
these groups of courses will close on
July 22. The second term, offer-
ing only six-hour and three-hour
courses, will run from July 23 to
August 28.

Through this summer session an
opportunity is afforded the student,
at any stage of his college course,
to advance his standing, because
the courses offered are chosen from
those given during the regular
college session. No course will be
retained, however; if the enrollment
does not justify it. Any such course
will be withdrawn, and the students
assigned to other courses.

A student entering on June 5 and
remaining through August 28 can
secure 14 semester hours of credit.
Twelve hours credit’ can be earned
by entering on June 11. A student
need not take both terms of work

New Men Join
Spanish Club

Sigma Delta Pi and the Spanish
Club met in the Quadrangles Room
last Monday night, March 8. The
meeting was opened with a short
devotional in Spanish by Herb
Mesa, after which two new mem-
bers—were-admittedintotheSpan-
ish Club, J. G. White, and Faison
Pierce. In welcoming these men
into the Club, President Strickland
urged them to attend the meetings
regularly, and extended this admo-
nition to the rest of the group.

A discussion of the possibilities
of holding a joint meeting with the
Spanish-enthusiasts at Queens Col-
lege was brought up, and this idea
was favorable to all. Mr. Joe
Stukes mentioned the’ important
fact that after all, Spanish is a
Romance Language, and therefore,
we should make use of the oppor-
tunity such a joint
offer.

After the transaction of business,
a short Spanish skit was presented

by Sres. Drake, Palmer, Parker,
and Walmsley. It illustrated the
old proverb, “don’t count your

chickens before they are hatched.”
While the Spaniards count olives
instead of chickens, the full mean-
ing of the adage was not lost. Sr.
Drake rendered an especially good
impression of the domineering wife.

Following this there was a cross-
word puzzle to be solved, appro-
priately called in Spanish, “rompe-
or “the head-breaker.” The
only two accurate solutions were
