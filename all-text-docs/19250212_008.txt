DAVIDSON
FIVE YEARS AGO

Crowded conditions at the gym made
it necessary to run two movie shows in-
stead of one, so as to accommodate all
who wished to see the shows. The first
show was run at seven’ and the other
about eight-thirty or nine, right after
ithe literary society meetings, which were
held on Saturday night.

Dr. C. R. Harding has just undergone
an operation for appendicitis at the Pres-
byterian Hospital in Charlotte and was
in condition. The Davidson-
| ian had following to say: “Although
jhe has suffered a great deal in the past
|week, his condition seems to be improv-
ing.”

Just five years ago the R.'O. T. C.
Band was organized with something like
twenty pieces. Up to that time there
had never been a regularly organized
|band, if at all, at Davidson. A brilliant
future was predicted for it.

A basketball trip through Virginia had
to be cancelled account of a mild
epidemic of influenza, This did not last
long, however, and several games were
played later in the season,

| The spring football training was then
lin the form of class football. A series
lwas played for the class championship,

cach class entering to perfect its team
jand get ready for the series which was
| to be started in the near future.

The following appeared in an editorial,
“Seven million words have been spoken
in the Senate on the peace treaty and no
good has been accomplished. Seventy
times seven could be said about taking
lights with same success. .

should take place in Charlotte. The exact
place in Charlotte could not be determined,
but this too was placed to the decision of the
committee who will have to investigate and
find out the most advisable place to have it.

Harlee Branch was selected as toastmaster.
Branch is one of the best speakers in the
class and is fitted for this job.

The class this year has determined to put
all they have into the banquet and all the
banquet has into them. There is no doubt
but that the whole class will be there as was
suggested by the wholesale eagerness with
which they decided upon Charlotte as the
place to have it.

The committee has not been appointed by
the president yet to look after the arrange-
ments, but this will be done immediately, ac-
cording to President Covington, and all the
details will be attended to. He states that
nothing will be left undone to make the
Sophomore banquet this year the biggest and
best ever.

SOCIETIES TO ALTER OLD
SYSTEM

| given in the past by only one or two societies,

Those who are selected to represent the
college on inter-collegiate debating teams,
with the exception of alternates, will be
given debating emblems. The cost of all
these awards will be borne by all the societies
jointly.

Further action taken by the Forensic
Council has been to arrange for inter-col-
legiate Freshman debates. At a meeting of
the Freshman class this morning, a member
of the Council announced the subject, Re-
solved, That the North Carolina Legislature
would be right in adopting the Port and
Water Shipping Bill as proposed. Tryouts
were announced for a near date at which
time the Freshmen will have an opportunity
to show their mettle for future inter-col-
legiate forensic frays. The Freshman class
this year possesses an abundance of material
which promises well under the direction of
the Forensic Council.

(Continued from page 1)
he saw a sight which resulted in his never
arriving at his destination. As he walked
along he noticed the moon rising over an old
church spire. This caused him to think of
God. Returning immediately to his London
lodging, he went down on his knees and
prayed to his God. Soon afterwards he went
to Scotland and told his wife of their son’s |
death. But even when he was explaining the |
sdd news he experienced a certain sense of
joy since hé found the Lord lending him
strength. |

Rapidly developing his points, Mr. Smith |
offered the following sketch for the purpose
of showing the superiority of the Christian |
religion:

“Christianity’s second great advantage over |
the religions of Buddha, Mohammed, and |
Zoroaster is its practical working plan. This |
is evident in comparing the peoples adopting |
the various forms of worship now existing |
in the world.

“In the third place Christianity creates in |
the hearts of its believers a desire to spread |
and propagate it. Recently I met a man who |
emphatically believed that the Eighteenth |
Amendment should be repealed if we are to |
have personal liberty. My answer to his |
argument was: ‘If the prohibition law |
should repealed, don't you realize that |
the Christian people of the United States |
wouldnever be satisfied quit fighting
until the law were repassed ?

“The fourth argument in favor of Chris-
tianity is its power of regeneration. It is the
only thing that changes a man’s life com
pletely when he accepts it. A drunkard liv-
ing in of our large cities entered a
saloon, He came out and a short time later
his whole life was changed. He was con-
verted to Christ.

3esides all these things our religion of-
fers us the hope of immortality, It is unique
in this respect.

“Finally, this is the only religion that per-
mits us to see Christ's healing of the
broken life of the woman at the avell, the
restoration the departed life to the
widow's son, and numerous other instances
reveal to us God's nature and show what Hé
is really like.

““This all sounds good enough,’ you
but it: won't work in my life.’ Let me cite
an instance of the way it works in individual
lives:

“A sea captain decided one Sunday morn-
ing to conduct a service aboard his ship. He
tried to explain the power of the Spirit in
men’s lives but was interrupted by a big red-
headed Irishman calling out, ‘What you're
telling us about is fine, but it won't work in
my life on the high seas.’ The captain re-
plied, ‘If it won't work for you on the seas
it won't work for me in New York. See me
after the services.’ The Irishman met with
the captain, The latter gave him two sim-
ple instructions: ‘Read your Bible and pray
earnestly each day.’ Two years later the
sea captain had the pleasure of hearing that
the Irishman was truly converted and was
then living a strong Christian life.

“T ask you all—have you given Christian-
ity a fair trial? It’s the only thing that
give you satisfaction.”

STUDENT BODY ROLL IS
REDUCED SINCE EXAMS

Since the Christmas holidays the ranks |
of the student body have been depleted |
by twenty withdrawals. Failure to pass |
the required amount of work was the
trouble in most of these cases. As an
offset to these lossess, eight new men
have registered. Of this number, five
are former students of Davidson: The |
new men are: J. E. Fraley, D. C. Ewing,
J. A. Joiner, J. A. Caligan, T. G. Colt-
rane, S. M. Wrenne, J. E. Love, and J.
M. Williams.

Registration for next year is further
advanced at present than it was last
year at this time. At the present rate
the college will be signed up to capacity
by the last of May.

that all future wars will be merely a

further wars, because of far-fetched
