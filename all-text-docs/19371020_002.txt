Improve Thyself...

A member of the College faculty makes
this remark to his classes. every year:
“When yon graduate from Dayidson. you
will not be adequately equipped to take up
any sort of technieal work in your ticld—
no more so than when you graduated from
high school.” ,

Aad that staternent is all too true. That» .
professor added ‘that Davidson's conctribu-
tion to the individual student was “cultural
development and advaacement— Tut that
takes some capianation. :

Sinee the College course gives onty-a |
general smattering of varied types of know-
ledge as it should in an institution of this
type, just what do we get out of Davidson
College?

First, college lite. not partieularty that at
Davidson cither, should develop the indiivid-
ual personality in the ability to get along
with one's tellow man. ft makes the stu-
dent more able to stand the much greater
galt to come in life. It should make the
student more independent and aware oi his
abtlities and failings.

‘In the second plaec, the College courses at
Davidson do give the college man a géod |
‘veil rounded imowiledge upon which to
build. After all our learning does not end
in college. Nor do we wish to specialize
too soon and thus leave other sides unde-
veloped.

Lastly, the Davidson student can get a
large per cent of the benefits of his college
career from extra-curricular aetivities and
cultural development outside of the college |
Gurrieulum. No studeat should go through
college without iurthering his iaterests and |
talents athletically. niusically, in literary
lines, in pnole speaking. eie., where his abil- |
ities may lie. — _|

li you graduate irom Davidson Coilege |
without. attemptiag to advance yourself in
every possible line of endeavor, within cer-
tain himits, you have done yoursclf a grave
injustice—you have passed up an oppor-
tunity chat will mever again come your way.

oe eo @ @

Contrary to popular belief, it is the ca-
ed and not the chorus gitl who is holding
most of the model jobs these days. Adver-
tisers demand an intelligent, animated face,
which reflects a definite personality, as well,
as beauty and a stream-lined figure.

Car Or Coffin? ...

Do you want to turn your car linto a
Coffin? You are perhaps one of a large
number of Davidson students who take to
the open road on weck-ends. -And, if you
do, you in all probability do your traveling
by car. Driving to and from football games
is dangerous business.

Maybe this poem quoted from the Daily
Texan will make you think just a little bit:

‘N run up Ye @ stop sign ‘n slap ‘em on ’n
skid?

. Did yon ever pass a School-yard ‘n give the

horn a slam
"N drive close to a gang o’ kids 'n see ‘em

jump ‘nh seram? :
Did you ever take a quart o’ rye ’n swal-

iow four or five 7
'N take the o'd bus down the road 'n show
“em how to drive?

°

Have_yot ever secn a little child all crum-
ped up ‘n still—

Whe tried to run aeross the street while a
car came down the hilt?

Ifave you seen men’s brains on fenders?
Flave you seen b'ood in the strect ?

Have you seen them stare at the bloody
Stumps of things that once were their?
fect?

Wave you ever heard the crash ’n scream
‘n seen the ghastly stare

On the face of what had been the driver
‘n the rest of the man not there?:

S
Morbid ‘nh gruesome gory this, I’m sorry,
but don't you see,
This was not meant to be read by folks as
tender as vou ‘n me.
it was meant jor the thoughtless ’n care-
less, who kill ’n maim ‘’n mar—
The reckless fool who is to blame — the
man in the other car.
~—By Phil Braniff.

rotn|

Vor a good many years there has been
agitation on {oot to secure public speaking
instruction for Davidson. Many editorials,
pleas, and petitions appear during the school
year, but seemingly without effect. Labor-
ing under fond delusions at the close of the
session, and hoping that our expectations
‘will be realized, we come back term after
term in the fait to find that nothing at all
has been done— that is as far as any plans
are revealed lo the student body. Is it pos-
sible that serious efforts could be made by
the faculty and administration with so little -
results?

Complaints are launched constantly
against The Davidsonian for its inaccuracy
and lack 6f real news. If instead of de-
structive and cutting criticism, the paper
would receive constructive co-operation
from the members of the student body and
the faculty, a better publication might re-
sult. It is rather discouraging to be as-
signed a story and have the professor sat-
irize mistakes of past fssues and finally
end up by refusing to make any statement
or saying that things have not developed
sufficiently yet.
