Seven Come Eleven

At first reading, the report of the
Committee on Rules and Punishments
seems a bit disappointing.

Perhaps what many people were
expecting was a long tirade against
the paternalism of the faculty and ad-

ministration to be followed by a re-
port calling for the abandonment of
many of the school’s Presbyterian-

Marshall Law

The long arm of the fuzz reached
into our placid little community last
plucked a rather
alarmed member of the student body
off the street, and deposited him in
durance vile, charged with disorderly

Saturday night,

conduct.

Although he may have found cala-
boose accommodations more comfort-
able than his dormitory room, the
highly questionable, nay, unbelievable,
circumstances of the arrest constitute
a ridiculous reason for him to have to
explain for the rest of his life why he

was once arrested.

The officers seemed to be hearken-
ing back to Grade B movie tales of
tthe inequities of Southern justice.
They only lacked cattle prods and

bloodhounds.

Riot tension may be a cause but is
not a reason for the arrest. Such inci-
dents only increase the probability of

riots.

If blind justice, urged on by riot
backlash, manages to convict the hap-
less student, we would have to urge
the town of Davidson to secede from

Mecklenburg County.

oriented regulations. ;
Instead, the committee chose, in its

preamble, to emphasize the school’s

primary purpose as the development
of men for “leadership, service and
self-fulfillment.” Student responsibi-
lity and maturity is the keynote of the
preamble, and the code which follows
seems to provide a more meaningful

way to develop them.

Three important changes are ob-
vious at first. One, of course, is a

recommendation of drinking on cam-

pus, in certain places, and another is
a proposal for open dormitories on
weekends. Both of these have been
campus issues for years.

The third proposed change has
been discussed less but is certainly of

at least equal importance. In urging

greater student representation on the
courts determining violations of SGA
regulations and a greater student
voice in determining punishments for
these violations, the CRAP report
makes its most. significant contribu-
tion to student responsibility.

The report is intentionally unpre-

tentious. It seeks to liberalize severa!
student regulations without making
a frontal assault on the college’s Chris-
tian commitment or its basically con-

servative orientation.

It is not, however, an attempt to
sneak past the faculty and the trus-
tees by speaking softly.

It seémis rather to be an assertion

2 VIEWS _ OF DISSENT

° Davidson ‘Not A Berkeley’

To The Editor:

This, letter is not intended
as an indictment of student
diversity, but as an inquiry
into the virtue of small
groups on this campus being
able to project an image of
discontent that is not neces-
sarily representative of the
entire student body.

Seen from within, one can
distinguish these small ele-
ments of the student body:
but viewed from without by
those who are removed from

Picketers
Learn How
Poor Feel

To The Editor:

Besides the integration of
the barber shops here in Da-
vidson, perhaps one of the
important results of the par-
ticipation by students in a
peaceful and lawful demon-
stration is the experience
which they have gained in
attempting to change the
opinions and views of many
people in this community.

They have learned the
sense of frustration and an-
ger which accompanies the
sudden realization that there
do exist in this country two
sets of laws, one for the rich
and one for the poor. The
actions of the police of the
Town of Davidson and Meck-
lenburg County on Saturday
are prime examples of this.

* Those students who have
involved themselves with this
demonstration have left the
protected ranks of white,
middie.class America and
have joined for a few mo-
ments the ranks of black,
poor America.

They can now understand
the feelings of people who for
so long have attempted to se-
cure for themselves the rights
and privileges of American
Citizenship, but have contin-
ually met the opposition of
the “duly constituted author-
ities’ of the white majority.

No matter what the final
result of Davidson's “integra.
tion crisis,’ the complacent
life of the Davidson “white-
liberal” student has been in-
terrupted, and his belief in
the actual existence of
“equal protection of the
jaws’ has been shattered.
Hopefully, the shattering of
a myth will result in the es-
tablishment of a reality.

the campus—parents, alum-
ni, friends. benefactors.
Church leaders, and those
who have a strong faith in
Davidson to provide a stable
environment for their youth
— one becomes’ confused
about the real educational
process at our school.

Our question is essentially
this: Do these notions of
radicalism and unrest not
alienate a large and produc-

tive segment of the popula-

tion and turn them away
from the Davidson cause?

We expect outsiders to sup-
port our college, and then we
wonder why they often fail to
invest. in our college's fu
ture with donations, endow-
ments and aid. Are we not
moving away from the basic
presuppositions upon which
our institution was founded
when we allow a small group
to distort the student image
here at Davidson?

We are not asking anyone
to forsake the principles of
social justice for economic
support. Rather, we are ask-
ing for a serious reevalua-
tion of the image which we
as a student body present in
relation to the principles up-
on which the college was
founded.

We are not advocating a
general apathy on the part
of the students toward all
significant social, political, or
religious issues,

However, is it not our goal
as full-time students at
Davidson to pursue an aca-
demic enlightenment and a
cultural maturity that a
great many of us believe can
be wrought most effectively
from the conscientious appli-
cation of our resources in the
classroom and not in the
streets? Or in consultation
with our professors, and not
in demonstrating on the tops
of dormitories? Or in study-
ing, and not in the most sen-
sational actions?

Once we have reached that
maturity of a college grad-
uate and once we have
studied the problems labor-
jously, then we can put our
ideas into practice.

We wonder what the re-
actions of these same people
will be after they have ex-
perienced the real challenges
of life, and not just observed
them from the ivory towers
of college life. In college it
is easy to react from the
periphery and then once
again retreat to the campus
when the going gets tough.

Hence, we come to the

that liberalization can take place with-
in, and in spite of, the college's com-
mitment and orientation.

That. assertion is both well-put and
long overdue.

main issue. Davidson is not
a Berkeley, even though a
small group seems to desire
such; and the founding fath-
ers and the men who have
given us our priceless heri-
tage did not intend it to be.

For those who do not cher-
ish the Davidson heritage,
for those who seek a more
diversified atmosphere, and
for those who believe David-
son is doomed to failure un-
less she conforms to the pro-
totype of the prestigious uni-
versities, we ask this ques-
tion: If you speak of the need
for diversity in education,
why not use the corollary in
respect to the entire educa-
tional system? Does not
Davidson, a ‘‘selective’’ and
a good liberal arts school,
have something unique to
offer the entire educational
process?

Suppose we gamble and
move in the direction of the
larger and more diversified
schools; can we compete for
this diversity which some de-
sire? They have more money,

more students, more grad-

uates, and more resources
than we, but do they have a
better educational system?

Therefore, it is because of
these problems that we sub-
mit our letter to you, Mr.
Editor. We do not believe
that those who see the good

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Workman Proposal--Buy Black?
ROTC Heckling--A Dishonor?

To The Editor:

THE DAVIDSONIAN ask-
ed me to write a letter in ex:
plication of my position on
the recruitment and funding
of additional Negro students
for Davidson.

An editorial in the last
DAVIDSONIAN before the
spring break led me to say
a few words to two of my
classes. It seemed to me
then, as it still does, that
the editorial sought a most
desirable objective, an in-
crease in the number of Ne-
gro students.

It seemed to be then, as
it does now, that students
could demonstrate genuine
interest in such an objective
in two ways, namely, con-
tributing funds and engaging
in the act of recruiting. I
hoped that my , comments
would encourage both.

The -verbal response -ror.
students has been most en-
couraging with respect to
money. Some students have
told me that they ‘anticipate
confronting me with enough
student contributed money to
call for my delivering the
100 dollars that I promised
and for my getting at least
one other faculty member to
give a 100 dollars.

Two faculty members have
told me of their willingness
to participate at a 100 dol-
lars each. I am confident
that there are at least eight
or 10 other. faculty members
of like mind.

It may be that the fund-

points in the traditional
Davidson education have
spoken out.

We believe that the great.
majority reject the student
activists and radicals who
can only find fault with our
society and with our college.

We believe that the stu-
dents at Davidson who have
been a part of the enobling
experience here should let .it
be known that our student
body is not apathetic, but
neither is it as radical as a
minority would make us
think.

We believe the Davidson
image is something of which
we can be proud, when it is
not distorted: we believe that
the uniqueness of the college
gives it distinction and sta-
ture: and we believe that
just because something does
not provide an outlet for
marches or protests, it is not
necessarily bad.

We, as students, are dedi-
cated to following the ideal
of Davidson College—sound
leadership, based on a rigor-
ous academic schedule, sup-
ported by sturdy moral prin-
ciples, and attended by stu-
dents who will cherish the
legacy we have inherited.

raising is the easier of the
two activities. Student par-
ticipation in recruitment may
be less available, but it is
equally, perhaps more, im-
portant. I believe that most
of the students now enrolled
are here chiefly because oth-
er students actively sought
to have them apply.

I think that the moe ef-
fective way for us to encour-
age additional Negro admis-
sions is for our students to
do the recruiting. for our stu-
dents to seek in their own
communities Negroes who
can profit from what we have
to offer. for our students to
urge such prospects to apply
for admission.

I am sure that enthusiastic
and sustained effort by our
students would be more pro-
ductive than any other tac-
tics of recruitment.

When I made my com- —

ments in class I was not at
all sure that many students
were sufficiently interested
in bringing additional Ne-
groes into our student body
to be willing to contribute
money.

Now I believe that enough
money for two or three re-
cruits will be forthcoming. I
am still not sure that many
students are sufficiently in-
terested to spend time in re-
cruitment, but I am eager to
be convinced.

I made my offer without
first consulting my wife; she
says now that she'll be my
guarantor.

W. G. Workman

Professor of Psychology

To The Editor:

Dr. W. G. Workman's chal-
lenge makes me think of a
fat man in a white suit and
string tie leaning back in his
front porch straw-back rock-
er to say, ‘Ma, le'z go out
and buy ourselves a nigger."

The idea of one or two
black scholarships reeks of
tokenism. Negro students re-
ject Davidson because of the
Southern white atmosphere,
not because it costs too
much. Financial aid is plenti-
ful.

We can help the poor
Negro more by bringing him
to a college that can accept
him regardless of his back-
ground than we can by pay-
ing him for his blackness. A
homogeneous student body
cannot give this kind of ac-
ceptance.

Instead of hiring a student
to come in for a year to be
unhappy because of David-
son's homogenized  white-
ness, we should use the
money to create a more con-
genial setting for the Negro
student.

Use money raised by stu-
dents to finance the recruit-
ing of students. who would
break Davidson's tradition of
Southern upper middle class
inbreeding. This means poor
Negroes. It also means New
York Jews and Chicago Pol-
lacks.

Maybe the Athletic Depart-

ment does have a few things
to teach us. Lefty Driesell
does not get students from
Indiana and New York just

-because he offers them a

scholarship. He gets them
because he can sit down with
the boy to tell him (person-
ally, not ina form letter) just
what Davidson can offer him
educationally.

The Admissions Office has
said it cannot do this type
of recruiting because it has
neither the personnel nor the
money for traveling. Instead
of buying ourselves one or
two ‘Nigras,” let's pick up
Dr. Workman's challenge and
use the money raised by it
to challenge the Admissions
Office to get us out of our
homogenized milk carton.

To The Editor: ;

In my four years at David-
son College. I have never
been so disappointed and
disgusted in anybody as I
was Tuesday. Fortunately
for me, I was working in a
hospital at the time, for I
am sure the sight of a Rus-

‘sian flag would indeed have

sickened me.

You, the intellectual ones
of this “great school,”’ or
whoever took pride in dis-
playing Russia's flag ought
to go even further. There's
no place for you in America.
This country won its freedom
by fighting. It was a costly
price.

Since then, we have had to
defend that freedom many
times and the cost in money
and lives has been great.
But until now, history has
not recorded such a divided
nation as we have.

We have fought and men
have died so that you guys
can have the right to show
off in front of men who are
at least attempting to pre-
pare themselves for defense
of us in case our freedom is
once again violated.

If you value communism
more than this country's
principles, then leave. Please
leave. There is no room for
you in America. But more
important, you are not want-
ed in. America.

With the past week of sad
events and America's at-
tempt at peace in Vietnam,
I find it hard to understand
that some of you have no
better way to spend your
time.

This school has left me
with many wonderful mem-
ories. I'm proud of David-
son and of its tradition, but
as for you guys, I just hope
the day will never come
when you will be called upon
to defend the freedom of this
country—whether by war or
by vote.

Last weekend I was fortu-
nate enough to be sent as a
Student Council delegate to
IMPACT, an annual sympo-
sium at Vanderbilt Univer-
sity. This symposium is or-
ganized entirely by the stu-
dents and deals each year
with a topic of national rele-
vance.

The speakers were the best
around. This year's IMPACT
featured Robert Kennedy,
William Buckley, Max Ler-
ner, Jack Newfield, Julian
Bond and Tom Hayden, all
controversial and nationally
known men. John Lindsay
and Nicholas Katzenbach
were also scheduled to speak
but had to cancel at the last
minute.

The assassination of Dr.
Martin Luther King provid.
ed lively debate on the topic
“Destiny of Dissertt." Some
speakers predicted a future
of violence in the American
cities; others called for the
continuation of nonviolence
in the Civil Rights move-
ment.

To The Editor:

It is apparent that M. Sgt.
Forrest E. Todd should leave
Davidson College if he wish
es to find ‘‘(his) army.” Al-
though not directly involved
in the students’ demonstra-
tion during the Tuesday fed-
eral inspection, I wholeheart-
edly support it, and regard it
as a reflection of the liberal
arts atmosphere which Da-
vidson avowedly fosters.

Alluding to the demonstra-
tors, Todd remarks that he
became ‘‘sick at (his) stom-
ach for what (he had) seen.”
Obviously, the students who
heckled the part-time sol-
diers were showing their dis-
gust for the type of occupa-
tion which Todd pursues.

Todd’s unbounded dismay
concerning the display of the
Soviet flag, and his unquali-
fied admiration of ‘‘good
men who get killed trying to
kill other people."’ thorough
ly sicken me, as I hope it
also must appall most peo
ple who retain a significant
degree of moral awareness.

If Sgt. Todd and the oth
er representatives of David
son’s ROTC department wish
to inflict young men with the
narrow and rigid thought
patterns which the military
evidently endowed them, 1
hope they will find a place
far better suited to their
closed-mindedness than an
educational institution.

Extended Rush

Davidson students live in a state of extended rush.
There's the weekday rush. The rush to get to
class. The rush of getting assign-
ments read, papers completed. The
rush to get to Hattie’s before she
closes; the rush of chugging a quart
so you can forget.about all the rush-
ing you've been through already.
Then there's the weekend rush. -

The rush of getting a date for Sat-
urday night. The rush of picking
her up, dashing to dinner and a
flick, rushing to grub for an hour
and then rushing to get her back

to her dorm,

ah

This is the rushed generation.
The mad dash to grow up, to appear sophisticated at
15, or earlier. The high school rush—the mad whirl
of grade-grubbing, test-taking. It’s climaxed by the rush
of getting into the right college.

So Davidson students, ‘the ones that went to tough
high schools, come prepared for the subtle, always-
there-beneath-the-tranquil-surface pressures. If they
don’t arrive prepared, they learn quickly.

Rush is not a once-a year thing here. It’s the relent-
less circularity of the academic and social treadmill
whose machinery never breaks down.

The unremitting pressures are always here. But
these are often purposeless, self-defeating pressures.

My God, where does it all lead, where does it ever

end?

Living here is like swimming around the periphery
of a whirlpool.’ Man, you’ve got to keep swimming or
get sucked into the vortex, into the sewer of academic

and social failure.

Davidson students get rushed through four years
of college—four years that provide so little time for
introspection, for self-analysis or for self-fulfillment

in non-academic areas.

__ As I rush fo finish this column, because it’s get-
ting very late, I feel only a profound sadness.

In these small hours of the morning, the pres-
sures relent for a few minutes. Where am 1 going, what
is the sense of all of this? I do not know.

Someday, I swear I'll have the time to sort out the
kernels of meaning from the chaff of superficiality.

But not now, not this week. I’ve got a term paper,
a review, and Spring Frolics is next Friday.

Vanderbilt Symposium Has

War and the political and ec-
onomic an-
swers to the ....

America’s op-
pressed poor
were lively :
topics of dew 5 *

speaker even
tried to pene.

heart of
American society and define

The point which impressed
me most, though, was the in-
terest it stimulated among
the students. The question-
and- answer sessions with
these men gave them a
chance to match wits with
those who are running our
nation. It seemed as if they
felt education is incomplete
without first-hand evidence
of today’s leaders.

Then I began to relate this
to Davidson. Wouldn't this
be a wonderful way to re-

mal state of isolation by

eral years, but no one has
done anything about it.

Of course such symposiums
are expensive. This year
IMPACT costs totaled $12,-
000, but the students made
more than enough to pay for
it. They raised money by
selling tickets and soliciting
from foundations, alumni.
parents and community lead-
ers.

The publicity they give the
program through the news
media and the reputation it
has acquired over the last
five years enable Vanderbilt
students to procure such out-
standing speakers. Davidson
would have to begin some-
what more humbly.

The most impressive thing
about the whole idea is that
students are the key. They
can decide on the topic, the
speakers and the nature of
the symposium. The success
or failure depends upon their
efforts.

So, student senate, if you're
not too busy, here’s some-
thing you can do for the stu-
dents. Maybe you can make
this the fourth “big week-
end" of the year.
