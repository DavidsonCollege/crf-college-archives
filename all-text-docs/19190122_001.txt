what by a large number of fouls on
each side. ‘Lhe inability of both ‘sides
to cage these tree shots made an extra
five minutes of play necessary. as the
score was 13-13 when time was called.
By some pretty work, especially on the
part of Denny, the Freshmen scored
three field goals and one ‘foul during
this extra period, thereby putting the
game on ice. For ‘the Juniors, Me-

Alister, at guard, did the best work.

Askew and Craig plaved the entire floor

at forward and Price at guard were the
stars for the winning team.

of Company ‘!A” last fall. The Sophs
who gave last year’s champions such a
close race had lost some of their best
men. Burt contrary to the general opin-

They took the lead in the early part of
the game and held it thruout the entire
game, the final score being 26-18.

For the Sophomores, Ormond and
Harrington did some splendid goal
shooting. The field work of Harring-
ton was also particularly good. The
guarding of Brice was tight and effect-

The stars for the Seniors were Daven-

up to his usual form and was with the
ball during the whole game.
