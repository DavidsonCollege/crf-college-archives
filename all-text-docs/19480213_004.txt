[Bers and brought therefrom a hu-

“The -story is often related by the
| students, is that a whole skeleton
| was dropped into ‘the column, This
| version of the story, however, must
be erroneous, because had a whole
skeletore been dropped into it, a
thorough search would have re-

Thus, according to THE
DAVIDSONIAN, which, as we
know, always right, but is
never wrong only a skull was found
and it was discovered in 1914 and
so of course was not found when
the columns were torn down.
Nevertheless, there is still further

land writes;

“We feel that you should know
no skeleton. Qne rainy Sab-
| bath afternoon a curious lad named
{Dumas ('15) who came to David:
from the wilds of Atlanta,
“Butch” McKay (17) and several
others explored the depths of the
| pillows with the aid of a pocket
| flashlight suspended on a bit ot
twine. This was not very success-
ful due to the accumulated dust,
debris and other bric-abrac found
in each column, Not satisfied,
Dumas went down in place of—or
with—the flashlight, carrying also
a basket and the promise of those
letting him down that they would
eventually pull him up again, and
that they would refrain from
dropping anything, liquid, solid or
otherwise into the column while
he was down.

| why

son

In one column he found a hu-
man skull, in good condition ex-
cept that it was cut like the pump-
kins used at Hallowe'en, The sec-
tion of bone which had been cut
out was also found. In another pil-
lar, he found a complete skeleton,
badly eaten by what appeared to be
lime. The basket was used for
bringing up the bones, A section of
the back and ribs_was allotted to
“Butch” McKay and his unfor-
tunate roommate —and~ decorated
the walls of 15 Watts, during the
remainder of ‘their sojourn at
Davidson... 3

“Anyway, tHis is why no skeleton
was found when the pillows of Old
Chambers were pulled down by an
order of the Trustees.”

From the above we can see that
Mr. Rowland was well informed,
and I believe that his is the more
complete account of what actually
happened. THE DAVIDSONIAN
evidentally made a slight slip up
when it stated no skeleton was
found, and Miss Shaw had prob-
ably never heard of the story since
the incident even though she was
here when the incident occurred,
having come to Davidson in 1907.

Finally, as a matter of conjec-
ture, it is interesting to wonder
how the skeleton ever got there in
the first place. Perhaps some stu-
dent of the old North Carolina
Medical School went grave robbing
one night and then had to hide his
stolen cadaver when the law got
too close on his trail.

The Davidson chapter of the fra-
ternity does not consider musical
talent alone, or the membership in
one of the musical organizations on
the campus. It is the purpose of
this chapter to sponsor enterprises
in fields other than music, and any
division of the Fine Arts is re-
ceived with equal enthusiasm,

This initiation was the second
and final initiation of the present
school year In the spring the fra-
ternity will extend bids to another
group of men who will upon their
acceptance be initiated immediately
following the beginning of the fall
term.
