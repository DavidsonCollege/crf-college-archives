CAT TALES

BY JOHNNY CLARK
Davidsonian Sports Editor

A LOST OPPORTUNITY

Tennis Coach Harry Fogleman lost two nationally-} _ Davidson’s baseball team
ranked prep school netters this weekend because he| hosts Belmont Abbey to-
couldn't offer them scholarships. Both said that they)morrow afternoon in the
preferred Davidson but couldn’t afford financially to} start of a drive to score their
turn down scholarship offers elsewhere.

Cha mplaretiy both members of the United States Junior
ip doubles team wanted to attend Davidson, :
but because of lack of scholarships they went to other easy time with the Crusaders

schools.

It seems ridiculous to me that Davidson has such
easy opportunity to field one of the best tennis teams in
the nation and doesn't take advantage of this opportunity.

financial aid to tennis players, this situation might be ex- ers won two out of four con:

__ Ten opponents on the Wildcat schedule give finan-
cial aid. Davidson manages to hold its own against some
of these teams, but can’t even hope to beat such sub-
sidized powers as George Washington and UNC.
Coach Fogleman has managed somewhat phenomen-
al success with the tennis program since he has been at
Davidson. With a single scholarship there is no telling

what he could do.

_ | guess that there. are good reasons for not giving
the tennis players aid. There is no doubt but that David-
son’s academic standards would fall drastically with ten-
nis aid; and the school would be overrun by hulking pro-

fessional tennis animals.

Besides, there are probably Biblical references that
would show that financial aid to spring sports is a sin.

The money factor is important too. Six or seven
thousand dollars would be a ridiculous and extravagant

amount to sink into tennis,

although it is perfectly rea-

sonable to shell out $200,000 to remodel the very
obviously over-crowded Student Union.

The West Virginia encounters
Saturday were enough to break
a pitcher's heart. In the first
game, ‘Cat starter Dick Snyder
had so much style that his cat-
cher couldn‘t hold it. West. Vir-
ginia scored four quick runs on
past balis and wild pitches and
went on to win 7-3.

In the second game, the ‘Cats
almost repaid the Mountaineers
for a basketball game this win-
ter. The ‘Cats had two extra
inning leads and each time blew
them, one on a wild pitch and
the last, and most heart-break-
ing, on a dropped two-out fly
ball.

The Phi Gams pulled into first place in the IMAC

!softball race this week by winning two more games to

make their season record 8-0. However, both games were
one-run wins, indicating that perhaps prayers are helpful

even at Davidson.

mended for following this wise course.

MORE ALL-STARS

The Wildcat basketball team recently named an
opponent team, with All-Americans Jeff Mullins of Duk

and Bill Bradley of Princeton being unanimous choices

on the squad.

Ohio State's All-American center, Gary Bradds, select-|
ed by the Associated Press as Player of the Year, placed |

third in balloting with nine votes and Duke’s Jay Buckley

got eight votes.

Tied for the fifth position were guards Steve Courtin
of St. Joe and Bill Bliar of VMI.

With Bradds at center, Buckley and Bradley at the
forward positions, and Mullins and Blair in the backcourt,
this team could hold its own against any five around.

Although his batting average has slipped slightly,
from .500 to .143, Wildcat first baseman Sonny Graves
remains undaunted. Reports Graves, “Actually my real

value is the steadying influence I provide for the team.” 15-11.

second, Dick Bates hit a line

a contest in which they fell to their fifth defeat of the season, 6-3, but

brought their over-all record to 15-5, their best record within recent years.

Journeying to Winston-Salem
Saturday to that haven of piety,
Wake Forest, the tennis team
was far removed from the sin-
ful undertakings of Davidson's
Spring -Frolics. But the ‘Cats’
hearts must have been here as
they had more trouble than ex-
pected in subdueing a scrappy
Wake team, 63. ‘No one was
up for this matcb."’ commented
Coach Fogleman, ‘I imagine
they must have: been thinking
about their dates.”

The Deacons got off to a
quick start as Mike Alcala took
Bill Schutt in three sets, 6-2,

noticeably reluctant to com-
ment on the game.

Other results for the week:

The tennis tournament wend.
ed on its wearisome way, and
still seems far from completion.
The Phi Delt players, Buzzy
Parker and Paul Stotts, made a
clean sweep to come out on top
in the winners’ bracket.

In the losers’ bracket, the
Betas, Pikas, Sigma Chi's, and
Independents remain to fight it
out for the chance to play the
Phi Delts for the championship.
Chris Hawk and Bob O'Kelly,
playing for the Pikas, are the
youngest’ players remaining in
‘the tournament, both being
freshmen. However, they have
shown a good deal of finesse
and have a good chance to win
in the. Josers’ bracket. Inde-
pendents Robert Earle and Skip
Finger are the favorites in this
bracket. having beaten the
SAE's, SPE’s, and Pikas so far,
while losing to the Phi Delts.

The Kappa Sigs are heavily

life as a member of the team
that so cowed its opponents as
to convince the SAE‘s that the
safest defense was a forfeit. In
the only game they have played
so far, the Kappa Sigs literally
blew the ATO’s off the court.

Beerman is the Kappa Sigs’
hatchet man, and is touted as
the best volleyball player Dav-

the bruised ATO’s. Rounding
out the favored team is the tall-

Davidson took out its frustra-
tions from the West Virginia

Mary Monday. The ‘Cats got
excellent pitching from Earl
Cole and Barry Teague, and
hitting from Don Davidson, Rick
Smyre, and Dick Snyder to
down the Indians 5-1 and 7-2.

“Our greatest weakness,”
says Coach Stevens, ‘‘has been
on defense. We have had gen-
erally good hitting and pitching.
and our base running has im-
proved greatly, but our defense
continues to be unpredictable.
We make some great plays, but
we can't seem to get the easy

improve if we're going to do
much better.”

Surprising Thinclads
Capture Relays Win

BY TUCK JONES
The’ Davidson track team
managed. only three firsts Sat-
urday, but placed in‘ all but one
event in winning their fifth con
secutive Davidson College Re-
lays ctiampionship.

The Wildcats amassed 44%
points in defeating Washington
and Lee (37), Lenoir Rhyne (30),
Frederick (21%), East Ten-
nessee State (18%). Appala-
chian (14). High Point (11),
Cumberland (74%), Catawba
(5). Wofford (3), Elon (3), Pres
byterian (1), and Atlantic Chris
tion (0).

Three meet records fell in the
field events as running times
were slowed by a soggy track.
Bill Wade of Frederick eclipsed
the shot put mark for his third
time in three years, extending
the record to 48° 8°: Washing
ton and Lee’s Robin Kell set a
new triple jump record with a
leap of 44° %".

In the pole vault, Dale Hart of
East Tennessee State, Bill Mills
of Davidson, and Mike Cam-
bell of Lenoir Rhyne all jumped
13' %"' to break the old stand-
ard of 12° 6%"'. Hart. Mills.
and Cambell finished in that
order on number of misses. The
jump by Mills also set a new
Davidson College record.

The host team captured first
place in the distance medley,
in which Joel Morrisett, Den-
ny Phillips. John Barrow, and
Tommy Heffner ran one quar-
ter, one half, three quarters
and one mile respectively in a

Morrisett and Phillips then
combined with Alan Turner and

in -a- commendable .3:27.2.

Jim Wallace threw the discus
fifteen fect farther than his
previous best effort in winning
that event for Davidson with a
distance of 141° 5”.

Outstanding performer in the
meet was perhaps Robin Kell of
Washington: and Lee who ac.
counted for 14. of his team’s 37
points. In addition to his record
setting triple jump. Kell won
the high jump and finished sec-
ond in the broad jump.

For Davidson, sophomore
David Brown placed in three
events, picking up second in the
triple jump. fourth in the high
jump, and fifth in the broad

Wolfpack Linksmen
Whip Wildcats 12-9

Davidson’s golf team met a N.C. State combination
of skillful putting, tremendous driving, and fantastic iron
play with remarkable fortitude yesterday, losing to the

Wolfpack 9 to 12.

The match was very close and
undecided right down to the
wire. Everything hinged’ on the
last two golfers out on the
course. Playing on an obviously
“non Wheatie’’ team, Albert
James unfortunately went down
to ignonimous defeat. That was
all, as the team. like Albert, was
obviously not ‘up to par.”

The team seems io be im-
proving though. Having lost
more matches thay they have
won, they were’ at least in this
one right up to the final gun.
Co captain Bob Bost feels that
the team is ‘‘not bad” and that
“they are Improving with every
match."

The future seems to be prom
ising too with a fine group of
freshman moving onto the var-
sity squad next year. In fact,

in a recent match the varsity
barely eked out a win over the
freshman by the score of 13
to 11.

The ‘Cats' George Brewer
shared medalist honors with
State's Joe Godwin as both fir-
ed 74’s, In the other matches
Albert James lost 3-0, Dick
Nickel lost 3-0, Macky McClel-
tand won 244-44, George Brew-
er won 242-4, Champ Coving-
ton lost 24%-%, and Doug Mc-
Keever tied 132-1%.

Coach Scott was in Roanoke
during the meet, but plans to
return this week to try to turn
the ‘Cats back to winning ways.
The ‘“‘sandtrappers” don't have
much time left, with only the
Southern Conference Tourna-
ment, May 11-13, remaining on
the schedule.
