The dilemma of

college publications

By MARK DEATON
Editor
(Ed. note: This is the second
installment in a two part series
concerning college
publications.)

“The main problem with the
Davidsonian is that it’s
boring’’, said Joe Earle, a for-
mer Davidsonian sports editor,
now completing his masters in

journalism at Columbia
University.
For many, there is little

argument against extending .

that statement to include all
campus publication.

Despite such a claim, student
publications are fairly widely
read, according to a recent sur-
vey, with over 95 percent at

least glancing briefly at a few
articles in the Davidsonian or
perusing once the Quips and
Cranks.

The Wildcat Handbook,
although read by less than half
of the student body, is read by
almost all freshmen; The
Miscellany has a considerably

" smaller audience.

These four student
publications receive budgets of
approximately three-fifths of
the monies allocated by The
Campus Tax Council. They
may supplement their budgets
with sales of advertisements,
subscriptions, and patronages.

There was not an ad-
vertisement in the 1973-74
Quips and Cranks nor one
patron listed. The Miscellany
followed suit in ad-
vertisements, although they do
receive an annual grant from
the North Carolina Council for
the Arts.

Spencer names new assistant,
Love to replace Godbehere

By John Wood
Staff Writer

College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. chose senior Rick
Love as the assistant to the
president for next year. The
decision was announced on
April 8, one week later than ex-
pected, after “careful
deliberation.”’

Love will succeed present
Assistant to the President
Jerrv Godbehere.

The Assistant's duties will in-
clude clerical work for the
president and his secretary and
work as a_ liaison between
students and several com-
mittees of the Board of

Trustees. Other responsibilities
include preparations for con-
vocation and meetings and
showing college guests around
campus.

Both Godbehere and Lave
emphasized the role as liason
between students and the
President.

The office is ‘to let him (the
president) know what the
students are thinking,” God-

behere commented. He added

that he thought students could
talk with the assistant and then
be more relaxed before seeing
Spencer.

“The important part of it is
the link between students and
the President,’’ Love asserted,
“IT see just as much of a

responsibility to the students as
to the President.’’

Love, an English major, is
presently considering a career
in college administration and
so finds this educational ex-
perience as relevant support to
his future goals.

‘The best aspect is that in the
president’s office you’ll come
in contact with every other of-
fice,’ and so get a greater feel
for college administration in
general,’’ Love stated. Love
had at one time considered law
as a career.

Love also feels a strong com-
mitment to Davidson College.
It is this commitment that is
one of the factors that in-
fluenced his desire for the job.

“T think Jerry’s done a good
job,’’ said Love. He sees what
Godbehere has done as a good
model.

“It (the job) is a good source
of cheap labor,’’ commented

Godbehere in reference to his ©

position, ‘‘but the psychic
benefit is great.’’

Godbehere cited the link bet-.

President and clerical work in

tions of all four in a magazine
format published monthly:

George maintained that there
is not a sufficient amount of
news occuring at Davidson to
justify the reporting function of
the Davidsonian.

He is correct in his assertion
that there is generally not suf-
ficient news or pertinent in-
terest in any one week to fill
even three tabloid pages..

There, the Davidsonian at-
tempts to:define campus issues
through investigative reports,
analyses and its pages of
editorials and opinions. To
publish monthlly and comment
editorially on events that oc-
curred three to four weeks
previous eliminates to a great
extent the editorial potency of a
newspaper.

Negative comment on past
issues after decisions have
been made, can hardly be
regarded as valuable or fair.
The editorial pages would be a
great extent be reduced to a
public relations page or a scan-
dal-gripe sheet.

“If you were to take the edge
off the critical aspect of the
Davidsonian, it would not be
worth the paper it’s printed
on.” said Vice President for
Academic Affairs John. M.
Bevan.

The concentration of power
within one editorial board is
another aspect of Gerge’s
proposal that is not par-

ticularly appealing. However,
the informative functions of
The Wildcat Handbook and The

Quips and Cranks do overlap
considerably.

If the Wildcat Handbook,
published at the beginning of
each year, were made a
student handbook rather than
the freshman handbook, the
pertinent information such as
pictures identifying faculty,
staff, students, and ad-
ministration, would reach
students at a time when such
informationw would be useful
and up-to-date.

Such material is presently
published in the annual over a
year after it has informative
value.

“I think that idea has a lot of
merit,’”’ dsif 1975-76 Quips and
Cranks Editor Randy Hunter.

“J think you would have to
elevate the Wildcat Handbook.
I don’t think it’s the kind of
book now that people keep
around for ten years.

“T would like to do an annual
that was completely artistic
and not have to take 30 pages
for factual information. You’d
just have to avoid being bland
in the handbook”’, said Hunter.

If student publications are to
continue to demand such a
large proportion of the student
activities fee, they must be
more functional, more
economical in their production,
and editors and staff should
demonstrate to the Campus
Tax Council that they are
seeking to supplement their
allocations through the,
solicitation of advertisement,

‘ subscriptions, and patrons.

Seniors donate tube to Union

By BILL ELLETT
Associate Editor

A videobeam projection
television will be installed in
the new college union as the
senior ciass gift of the Class of
1975, according to Class
President Bob Corlew.

This television has a 4% x'5%
foot screen. The picture is pro-
jected onto it from a console
which is placed several feet
back from the screen.

“This gift affords to us the
opportunity to show that we

feel the union plays a-very im-
portant role in the lives of
college students.

“It will be an expression of
our desire that future students
have = better social facilities
than. we have had in the cram-
ped Carnegie building,” said
Corlew. —

The cost of the tishevinion it-

, self is $2795 installed. Any ad-

ditional contributions will go
toward the purchase of a video-
tape unit ($1700) or videotapes
($20 each.)

These tapes ‘would permit
such programs as ‘“‘Ascent of
Man,” “Civilization,” and

“Alistair Cooke’s America” to
be recorded for future
showings:

The members of the senior
class will be asked. to con-
tribute $15 each to the gift fund,
according to Corlew.

Other ideas considered by the
committee included making the
first contribution to the
proposed new field house,
giving a $3000 stand to the
library for its portrait of E.H.
Little, giving the college a
“significant” major work of
art, and constructing new
trophy cases for the debate
team.
