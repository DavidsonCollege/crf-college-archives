Prevailing Attorney in Roe v. Wade Case
Discusses Abortion : S Past, Present & Future

By Sally Stone

On Thursday evening, April
8, areceptive crowd filled the 900
room to meet the lawyer for the
most famous court case of the
modern generation, Roe versus
Wade. Sarah Weddington, law-
yer, teacher, aid for former Presi-
dent Carter, and former Texas leg-
islator, entertained and educated
the audience on a host of topics,
but primarily retold the story of her
involvement in the landmark case
from 1969 to today.

For anyone not present to hear
Weddington’s incredible journey
with Roe v. Wade, the circum-
stances would appear unbelievable.
Beginning with her decision to at-
tend law school in her home state
of Texas, Weddington has been
making firsts. Her most dramatic
entry pertains to Roe v. Wade; this
was her first contested case. Prior
to it, Weddington had worked fora
former law professor and filed only
uncontested simple cases, like
adoption.

Her unusual participation de-
rived from her willingness to try
the case for free, “because people
asked [her] to,” and because she
was a woman. Jane Roe’s desire
for an abortion, legal in Texas only
when the life of the woman was in
danger, came to Weddington’s at:
tention in 1969 when a concerned
group of female science graduate
students began advising women
on illegal abortions, under
Weddington's counsel.

Anearlier case, Griswold ver-
sus Connecticut, had established
birth control as a right of privacy
_ and stated in the decision a
woman’s private right whether to
“bear or begat a_ child.”
Weddington used this precedent to
file a complaint that Texas’s hun-
dred year old anti-abortion statute
violated Norma McCovy’s (a.k.a.
Jane Roe) right to privacy.

When asked what it was like °

to try a case before the Supreme
Court, Weddington immediately
reacted, “Scary.” She never be-
lieved that her case would appeal
all the way to the Supreme Court
because several other abortion
cases werealso pending. Only two
years out of law school,
Weddington “panicked,” then be-
gan preparing for her 1972 court

Describing her Roe v. Wade Supreme Court appearance as
"Scary," Sarah Weddington spoke in the 900 Room April 8.

date.

Describing the Supreme Court
experiénce, Weddington remem-
bered its intimidating architecture
and court room. She was only
allowed thirty minutes for oral ar-
gument against the Dallas District
Attorney, Mr. Henry Wade. Mul-
tiple briefings had been written
and submitted to the court prior to
their appearance.

The three legal issues involved
in Roe v. Wade were: Is there a
right of-privacy for pregnant
women; is pregnancy fundamen-
tal;-and-can the state regulate a
woman’s bodily decisions? When
the Supreme Court decided 7-2 in
favor of Roe several months later,
they found in favor of all three of
Weddington’s arguments.

The time span between the
case’s court date and the Court’s
decision was long enough for
Weddington to run and win a seat
in the Texas House of Representa-
tives.

None other than current gov-
ernor Ann Richards was her ad-

ministrative assistant. Soon after
her election, she received a collect
telegram informing her of their
favored decision.

Remarking on this decision’s
controversy twenty-one yearslater,
Weddington mentioned several
newissues under the abortion topic,
such as men’s involvement in de-
cision-making and the point of fe-
tal viability. Justice White’s re-
tirement and Justice Blackman’s
predicted retirement during the
Clinton, pro-choice, administration
will evenly distribute the Supreme
Court’s Roe opinion; three against,
three willing to weakenawoman’s
right, and three still in favor of
Roe.

Having produced the success-
ful argument, Weddington closed
her captivating lecture by predict-
ing less abortion cases in the fu-
ture. Although she does not fore-
see an overturning case,
Weddington fears that the in-
creased violence by pro-life move-
ments threatens the availability of
abortions.

Wearing Bag Wrong

Way Dangerous, Officials Say
LINCOLN, NEB. (CPS) - There’s
a proper way to wear a backpack
- but most students opt for a more
fashionable one-shoulder look.

However, following fashion
can be dangerous, health officials
say.

Wearing
shoulderpacks or shoulder bags
improperly can lead to problems
in the back, lower back and trape-
zius muscle, said Mark Feight, an
athletic trainer at Injury Preven-
tion and Care in the University of
Nebraska Campus Recreation
Center.

Hip problems, ranging from
minor irritation to pain when
standing, can also result from dis-
proportional backpack weight,
Feight said.

“The body is designed for
balance,” he said, “so you throw
your hip out to balance the bag.”

Students expressed the prob-
lems that they have had as a result
of improper wear of packs.

“T feel fatigue or cramps in
my - shoulder,” said Chris
Worthley, a senior psychology
major.

Herb Hess, a senior educa-
tion major, said when his shoul-
der muscles became tired, he
switched shoulders. This is the
treatment recommended by
Feight.

“Students should carry less
or alternate shoulders, but they
get in a habit of using only one,”
Feight said.

Faculty Strikes
at U. of Cincinnati
CINCINNATI, OH. (CPS) - Stu-
dents returning to the University
of Cincinnati after spring break
were greeted with picket signs
after the university’s faculty went
on strike.

A university spokesman said

backpacks, .

about 90 percent of the
institution’s 1,916 professors are
represented by the American As-
sociation of University Professors.
The union and the administration
couldn’t come to an agreement
over a proposed contract, and the
faculty went on strike.

The main issues causing the
faculty action were pay and other
unresolved issues, including uni-
versity governance and working
conditions.

Spokesman Jim Dexter said
graduate assistants and part-time
instructors were filling the void,
and that up to two-thirds of the
scheduled classes were held two
days after the strike began March
29.

Additionally, several full-
time faculty members were in the
classrooms, Dexter said.

Approximately 35,000 stu-
dents attend the publ ic university.

At Wooster, Tootsie

Rolls Win Hands Down
WOOSTER,OH (CPS)- The pre-
ferred candy at The College of
Wooster for seniors, it seems, is
the Tootsie Roll.

When the seniors turn in re-
quired independent projects, they
are rewarded with a small gift -
miniature Tootsie Rolls as a to-.
ken of their educational achieve-
ments.

Some students eat their candy
on the spot, although others keep
the candy as part of their college
memorabilia.

According to college offi-
cials, the tradition began 20 years
ago when a Wooster official
wanted toreward seniors for com-
pleting their required senior
project with a small gift.

Being mindful of the
college’s budget, the official gota
good deal on miniature Tootsie
Rolls by the carton and the prac-
tice has carried on.
