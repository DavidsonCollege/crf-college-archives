THE DAVIDSONIAN

By JENNIFER MILLER
Staff Writer

Outpost favorites Danielle Howle
and the Tantrums created quite a fuss
Saturday night.

Howle started off the night acous-
tic and solo. She spent as much time
story telling as singing her signature
lullabys and “perky” songs about ev-
eryday life.

Dressed in jeans and a T-shirt and
full of nervous energy, the South Caro-
linian jumped from story to story talk-
ing about everything from retinal scan-
ning on the Internet to the microbes of
the X-Files to old people, “All you have
to do with old people is show up, you
don’t even have to smell good.”

Howle knows Davidson — she
even made cracks about the Honor
Code. The packed Outpost loved her,
and she was so impressed with it — she
thought we rocked — that she pulled
out her camcorder and began filming
the audience. After the break she went
electric with her band, The Tantrums,
and the energy level soared.

She made Tigger look lethargic as
she hopped, jumped and whipped her
microphone cord with the music, The
crowd was on its feet and dancing ev-
erything from Shag (American style) to
head-banging to Riverdance-inspired
hopping until after midnight. One sat-

Howle described the band’s music
as “rock” for lack of a better word,

saying, “You’ve got to call it some-
thing, and you’ re always going to bother
someone.”

punk included old classics like the hard
rocking “Big Puffy Girl Handwriting,”
and the slow ballad “Back of Your

CHARLOTTE * Yo La Tengo
graced the stage of Tremont Music Hall
here Friday night.

The threesome is comprised of
extreme talent.

Georgia Hubley plays drums, gui-
tar, and keyboard, and is the prodigal
daughter of the masters who wrote
Sesame Street and Electric Company
jingles.

Ira Kaplan commands guitars and
the “New Wave” organ and James
McNew is addicted solely to the bass

The music is the focal point of

oways pleasing to the lyrically minded

Less than two weeks following the
irst concert in this year’s Concert Se-
‘ries, the Series brought one of
"Davidson's own back to Hodson Hall to
celebrate the 200th anniversary of one
F of history’s finest Romantic compos-
myers. ;
: Rufus Hallmark ‘65 (voice) and
‘Charles Burkhart (piano) performed
ranz_ Schubert’s 1827 work

the Tiger, Painful, and their most recent
I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One.

They have also received credits
for the song “Demons” featured in the
film J Shot Andy Warhol, and they are
responsible for doing covers ranging
from the Velvet’s “I’m Set Free” to an
instrumental version of a Ramones clas-
sic “Blitzkrieg Bop.”

Mark Jenkins, a music critic for
the Washington Post, described their
sound as traveling “from delicate to
vehement to funny” and “amiable and
engaging.”

On the most recent album, they
give their own impression of them-
selves ina song called “We're an Ameri-
can Band,” when they say, “Monday
matinee in pull — we are life’s throb —
so hard to choose between conceit and
rock.”

Yo La Tengo is not the angst-
ridden band we are so used to, nor are
they pretentious rock stars who can

. only drink Evian water. Instead, they

portray a simple, human inclusivity and
contentment in their music which is

reflected in their lyrics:

And if you care to stay in our little
corner of the world ;

We could hide away in our little
corner of the world

We always knew that we’d find
someone like you

So welcome to our little corner of
the world.

—‘My Little Corner of the World”

Winterreise, aset — or “cycle” — of 24
songs set to the same number of poems
by German poet Wilhelm Mueller.
Schubert loved Mueller’s poetry enough
that Schubert was quoted as wishing
that he had written it himself. Setting
them to music must have been the next
best thing.

Winterreise’s (A Winter Journey)
lyrics relate the tale of a rejected lover
who travels on foot through the frigid
countryside, distancing himself from
the town of his beloved. Many parallels

between the weather and the young
man’s state of mind are implied.
Schubert was also mired in a similarly
gloomy state at the time of the compo-
sition, as he was suffering from a termi-
nal illness.

Hallmark performed the entire
cycle from memory, with only a mild
break after the first 12 songs. He also
sang the piece in the original German,
which may have explained the vacancy
of the first three rows of the hall. The
rest of the seats were moderately filled.

Burkhart performed the accompa-
niment on Davidson’s own Bosendorfer
piano (“‘Bosendorfer,” I believe, is Ger-
man for “big mother”). Hallmark gave
a splendid performance, passionately
embodying the speaker of the poems
and his angst.

The vocalist’s vibrato was well-
tempered, rich enough to give off that
professional sound, but not so wide that
one could not discern which pitches he
was singing. The performance must
have been special for Hallmark, who

gave his senior voice recital on the same
stage 32 years ago.

Both musicians are on faculty at
Queens College (N.Y.), Hallmark since
1981 and Burkhart since 1962.. The
latter has written many publications on
musical analysis.

Most audience members were
thrilled by the 80-minute work, although
the concert experience was significantly
enhanced by the aesthetically-pleasing
program cover and free food at the
reception afterwards.
