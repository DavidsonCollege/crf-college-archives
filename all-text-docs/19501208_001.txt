Centermg in Brady's Alley, a
section of houses directly behind
Main Street stores and bounded on
another side by Depot Street, this
area has been a problem for many
years. In 11 houses 87 people were
forced to live without benefit of
water, lights or sufficient heat. The
dwellings themselves are from 50
to 75 years old. Many of these
have paper and bits of wood serv-
ing as window panes. In order to
maintain room temperature, their
walls are lined with cloth and rot-
ling newspaper,

Toilet facilities in Brady's Alley
consist of four or five outdoor pri-
vices. Constant moving of these
toilets left half-covered pits with-
in 10 yards of grocery stores and
restaurants. Some Negroes were
forced to close their windows in
summer because of a nauseating
stench from such privies. Lack of
a sewage system forced citizens of
the alley to slosh dishwater cither
into their yards or street. Their
chickens fed among Davidson's gar-
bage pails and then were killed and
eaten. Flies and vermin go un-
checked in the area. Dr. J. B,
Woods, local physician, revéaled at
a town meeting that Brady's Alley

PRACTICAL PROBLEMS:

Chapel Hill Sociology Professor
Will Lead Marriage Conference

Dr. Reuben Hill, of the University of North Carolina, will
be on the Davidson campus in February to present the first of
a hoped-for annual conference pertaining to the practical phases
of marriage. The conference ‘will include two chapel talks and
several smaller discussion groups on the campus in the after-

noons and evenings of the four-
teenth and fifteenth of . February.
In addition to these campus act-
ivities, Dr. Hill will speak to the
P.T.A. and several other groups
in the town of Davidson.

Dr. Hill is professor of sociology
and research professor in the Insti-
tute for Research in Social Science
at the University of North Carolina.
He has had a wide experience in
the type of work he will lecture on
in that he has counselled with many
students concerning premarital
problems, and haz writte. articles
and books on marriage and {ne
family.

The idea of having lectures at
Davidson on the practical problems
of marriage as 1t concerns the stu-
dents was first proposed by Dr.
George Douglas of the Sociology
Department. It was subsequently
discussed by Omicron Delta Kappa
‘and other groups on the campus.
Dr. Douglas has observed this type
of conference held on other college
campuses and expressed, along with
others, the desire to have such a
program sponsored on the David-
‘gon Campus. It was decided that
the conference should be held, and
the services of Dr. Hill secured.

In order to make the discussions
of interest to the student: body,
a list was given out in chapel and
boys were asked to select the topics
they would like to be discussed.

Director of Athletics Paul Scott
will present a survey of the poli.
cies adopted by other liberal arts
colleges, l’rofessor Fulcher will de-
fend the present policy and suggest
further subsidization if necessary
to meet Southern Conference com-
petition, and Professor Gallent will
criticize the present emphasis on
athletics. Two students will “also
be on the panel and Professor Ty-
son will serve as moderator,

The object of this discussion is
not to cause undue debate but to
provide an opportunity for the ex-
pression of a cross-section of ideas
and opinions on this subject which
is not only the concern of Davidson
College but a concern of most
colleges in America today.

The purpose of a liberal arts
college, subsidization, unbalanced
extra-curricular emphasis, a self-

from the Southern Conferesce and

some of the topics raised at this

TREE FALLS ON AUTO

A unique ,accident occurred in
Davidson last week. A large tree
on the campus side of Main Street
feil, landing across Main Street.
The automobile belonging to Mr.
C. S. Goodrum, which was parked
in front of his drugstore, was bad.
ly damaged. The tree fell of its own
free will.

hastt to get down exactly what
his subject is saying the reporter
often misses three quarters of what
is said. Much that is important is
left out and much of the trivial is
included. Also the person being
interviewed becomes too careful
about how he is being quoted and
often closes up. Mr. Johnson says
that he has -heard some of the best
editors tell their reporters to keep
their notebooks out of sight and
argue with the interviewed if nec-
essary. Do anything, they say, to
stimulate the person into giving
his real thoughts.

The reporter abandoned his note-
book and tried to glean from the
rest of the interview the significant
ideas without worrying about de-
tails. This, of course, was. also
under Mr. Jolinson's directions.

In answer io the reporter's ques.
tions Mr. Johnson said that he
felt that the worst thing that is
wrong with our system of higher
education today is that there is
too much of a competitive spirit
among our colleges and universities
for bringing in students. This, he
believes, was started by the church-
run schools. Not wishing to be mis-
understood he went on to explain.
Back in the days when most of our
colleges were founded the Metho.
dist church, for instance, would
found a small denominational col-
lege in a certain area. This they
felt would educate the youth to be
better Methodists. Soon the Bap-
tists not to be outdone would es.
tablish a similar college in the same
one. Sooner or later the Presby-
terians would do the.same and be.
fore long there would be several
colleges ‘in one area. Each would
be in stiff competition with the
others to get students to attend
its own hallowed halls while in
other areas there would be no col-
leges at all to attend.

Mr. Johnson wanted it to be dis-
tinctly understood that he was not

NUMBER TEN

5 Seniors, Ballard

The semi-annual tapping service of Omicron Delta Kappa,
national leadership fraternity, was held during the chapel per-
iod on Friday, December 8. Following a brief devotional con-
dueted by Gordon Scott, and a talk by Auburn Lambeth, presi-
dent of Davidson’s ODK chapter, who summarized the qualifi-

cations and purposes of ODK, the
pre-tapping address was given by
Rev. Walter Dickson of Belmont,
N. C., vice-president of the David-
son College Alumni Association
and a member of this ODK chap-
ter.

In his talk, the speaker used as
the basis the subject of “truancy.”
in which he compared childlike tru.
ancy to truancy in later life, both
in our religious and personal lives.
Just as we had the “so what?”
attitude as children we often find
this attitude pervading our outlook
even as we grow more mature. We
try “dovetailing’ Christ's advice
in the Sermon on the Moun’, hoping
to avoid responsibility. We put too
much stock in money and in mater-
ial gain rather than in the things
of the Spirit, even though we know
that what we individually do with
our lives is the most important de.
cision, we face.

Following the address by Rev.
Dickson, the tapping ceremony com.
snenced with the tapping of the
gavel by the president, whereupon
some member of the organization
went into the audience to select
the following six men as new mem-
bers:

Bill Cassels, of Richtand, South
Carolina, a candidate for the B. S.
degree, is president of Pi Kappa
Phi social fraternity. Aside from
this, he is editor of the 1950-51
“Quips and Cranks,” chairman of
the Publications Board, a member
of the cheerleading squad, and re-
cently elected to “Who's Who in
American Colleges and Universi.
ties.” Bill was tapped by Gordon
Scott.

Thenton “tHoopy” Davis is best
known, especialy to the freshmen,
as head judge of the Court of Con.
trol, but aside from this, his ac-
tivities, primarily athletic, consist
of membership in the Beaver Club,
varsity football squad, and the “D”

Frosh-Soph Day To
Settle Hat Issue

Hoopy Davis, Judge of the Court
of Control, announced final plans
yesterday for the Annual Freshman.
Sophomore Day on Tuesday,
Dec, 12. Activities on this day will
center around three athletic events
in which the second year men will
pit their strength and ski against
the impatient frosh, who will be
able to put aside their red caps if
they can take two out of the three
events,

The big event will be a touch
football game at 3:30 on Richard-
son Field. The sophomore squad
will feature such grid greats as Gor-
don Stuart, Arnold Whisnant, A.
C. Gregg, Seymoré Simmons, and
Wes Pritchard. The frosh will try
to combat this with such proven
gridders as Johnny Grey, Bob Loy,
Bill Putman, Neill Graham — in
short, practically the entire person.

Fall Functions
Found Festive
For Fraternities

On the evening of December 2nd
the brothers of Beta Theta Pi,
Kappa Sigma, and Sigma Phi Ep.
silon fraternities and their dates
attended their respective fall func-
tions,

The Beta's held their affair, an
informal banquet-dance, at the Red
Fez Club on the Catawba River.
They enjoyed a delicious steak din-
ner and later danced to the smooth
music of Ziggy Hurwitz’s orches-
tra. After dinner, Dr. Davidson en-
tertained the group by comparing
the morals of 50 years ago with
those of today. Approximately 35
couples attended the function
which lasted from 6:30-12:00.

The Policeman's Club at Morris
Field was the location of the Kappa
Sig affair. Approximately 50 coup.
les attended the formal dinner-dance.
After dinner they were entertained
by Charlton Torrence, who acted as
toastmaster. Later in the evening
everyone danced to the soft music
of Doug Hill and his orchestra.
Mr. and Mrs. Derrick Barton were
the chaperons.

The SPE’s had a banquet in the
Chez Montet restaurant in the Ho-
tel Mecklenburg which was fol.
lowed by a Skid Row Dance in the
Officers Club at Morris Field. Wal-
ter Hagan’s Orchestra supplied the
music for the affair. An interesting
side light is that Roy Palmer, a
freshman here at Davidson, plays
the piano for the group. The chap-
erons were: Major Sample, Prof.
Cheatham, and Dr. Goldiere. Bill
Rabb was toastmaster and Alonzo
