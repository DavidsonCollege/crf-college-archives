Thanks and Giving
and
Our American Past

And the food! Yu-uh-um! Col-

The first Thanksgiving, con-
sequently, fell through--Italians
became known, thereafter, as
immigrants, and the maid
Hiawatha, in cleaning up the mess,
gained a propitious aversion to the
concept of decapitation; but other-
wise, nothing thanks-worthy hap-
pened that day (Hiawatha’s aver-
sion, not Italians becoming known
as immigrants, being worthy of

thanks). No oné ate; no one drank;

no one flayed a pig, made a ball of
its hide, and went in:for six.

“A fiasco,” said Standish.

“A pisser,” claimed Jefferson.

“Wait’ll next year,” chirped’

- the cooks (losing one’s master-

can be frustrating).

They rose at dawn and festi-
vated ‘till dark (remember, Tho-
mas Edison wasn’t even born yet.
They had to stop at dark)--living,
loving, laughing. . .

And Jonathan Edwards said
the blessing. “Let us pray. . .”
(quick summary--he prayed some-
thing about a big spider-web, a
really filament-ridden and gross
one, coming down and getting all
mixed up in some food--I think it
was the mashed potatoes--he
prayed that the taters would be-
come fibrous tothe absolutely most
detestable degree and then that he
and his brethren would eat them
anyway--and enjoy it)

And they must have had them
some yams (OED, def. #4: South-
ern U.S.--the sweet potato).

I say this because yams are a
tuber.

I say that because I hope you
will be amused.

Now, seriously. . .J’m an
American, I have always liked
Thanksgiving; but when I learned
to eat my yams I fell in love.

Off-orangish brown, dull red-
dish amber--Aunt B. used to top
her yams with a layer of melted
marshmallows--all sweet and
foamy and white atop the gelati-.
nousmass. Asa youngster! thought
the whole business looked like
rabid dirt; as a mature adult, how-
ever, every T-day inhale me some
yams.

Again, Iam an American.

The Fathers of MY country
ATE their damn yams. .

. thank God for those Pil-

grims.

Andrew Spainhour:
Remembering

Christmas All Year

On Thursday night, in the midst
of final papers and reviews and
exam preperations, a good chunk
of the student body came together
in front of Chambers, drank some
hot cider, and sang Christmas car-
ols by candlelight. The annual ex-
perience reaffirmed, as in years
past, my naive belief that all people
are intrinsically good. Even dur-
ing the most hellish weeks ofa tor-
turously long semester, Davidson
folk couldn’t help but be nice to
one another. It did the soul good.

Two hours before the Miracle
on the Lawn, life at Davidson was
not nearly so rosy. Most students
were STRESSED. Imyself wanted
to curl up ina fetal ball underneath
adesk at the Computer Center, and
Ihoped for all the world somebody
would take me away to “‘a quiet
place,” just like they did with Jim
Bakker during his trial.

Though Davidson at times has
about as much Christmas spirit as
December in Mecca, events like
the Campus Christmas Party seem
to somehow rejuvenate people,

melting tension and frustration.
Though the euphoria is, in reality,
short-lived, the message does not
fade. Despite differing religious
beliefs and backgrounds, at Christ-
mas, many of us at Davidson, in
some manner or another, are
touched by a spiritiuality of sorts
that is somehow very gratifying,
even if we don’t know what we
believe all the rest of the year.
Examsstill make things very tough,
of course, but somehow seeing
Christmas spirit around youcan be
very comforting.

Christmascan be very empow-
ering--it makes us feel a little bet-
ter--itheals old wounds. This time
of year, we all are allowed a little
reversion to childhood anda small
measure of sappiness, andsoJ want
to invoke achildish and sappy, yet
fervent wish. I hope we canmaybe
remember what it was that brought
us outside last Thursday night
during the upcoming semester, to
make us all feel a little better when
things here are not so easy--and to
heal old wounds.

Scribblings

The worst part about Christ-
mas is waiting for it, and you can
trustthat theroad toward thatever
elusive goal is a long one. First
your teachers start talking about
final exams. (The bad part of the
coming of Christmas is that it is
preceded by these palsy little tests
of worthless knowledge we plan
to forget as soon as possible.)

Then you’re eating your tur-
key with your grandparents and
watching a parade that inevitably
ends with Santa on a fire truck.
Whether you are watching Ker-
mit the Frog float down Fifth
Avenue or your little cousin rid-
ing her bicycle down Main Street
is irrelevant. The important thing
is that Santa is on his annual trip
to see. who’s been naughty and
who’s been nice.

But Santaheads back upnorth
after a while and there’s a bit of a
lull in the excitement. Youcome

study every night until finals and
then leave as soon as possible. Of
course you head to the Pub on
Monday, your lounge on Wed-
nesday, and Backstreet on Thurs-
day. Surprisingly enough yousee
your friends there accompanied
by that little juvenile influence,
beer. Luckily, there are a few
posters hanging up in those estab-

}lishments with beautiful bodies

sitting in Santa’s lap trying to
appeal to the truly Idish side of
your psyche.

Then Santa returns by way of
a rappel rope and you forget just
forasecond thatpeople would ac-
tually threaten to kill someone
because of their sexual choices.
Sil, your Christmas spirit is

Rude Notes and Random

Frampton on Christmas.

- reading when you study for fi-

back to school with aresolution to’

rekindled and you head back to
your dorm with visions of sugar-
plums dancing in your head. And
you put on your cap and settle
down foranap. Then whatshould
appear but three friends who want
to sing more Christmas carols.
So you climb out of bed and de-
cide you’ ll just do the next day’s

nals.

Well, Vespers rolls by and
you’re really impressed with the
singing. But then its reading day
and you remember the Grinch is
coming in two days from the day
after today and you run to the li-
brary to study a little. Still, those
days without classes remind you
of home where you soon will be,
and its alittle bit hard to get much
work done.

So finals pass and you feel al-
right. You probably could have
studied more on Saturday night
butits all past younow. Then you |
think, “It’s all past me! I’m doné
with a semester!” It’s like the
whole weight of Chambers has
been taken off your back. It's the
feeling you get after finishing a
mid-term-wéek-times-a-million.
You're giddy and silly and you
scream at your friends. Youdon’t
even pack; you just throw it all in
your suitcase and laugh as you
throw out all of your notes. It's4
Christmas and soon youare going
to get Presents because Santa’s
coming back south foraone night
tour. Soremembertoask fora4.0
when you write Santa and get
ready because you are about to
get absolute proof that there are
some things that even Santacan’t

do. eo,

pennant and almost take the Se-
ries. O.K. Maybe that has nothing
todo with Davidson, but it’s still
damn strange.

--Swastikas? Wait a minute.
I’mthe one in Germany. I thought
we had the monopoly on Neo-
Nazi jerks. (A tip for rooting out
the coward: they guy with no hair
did it.)

You’re not far off the mark if,
at this point, you’re asking your-
self, “What the hell is this behind-
the -times idiot talking about?”

Just sort of reprising that old
Dylan lyric, I suppose.

Anyway, I just wanted to ex-
press a little concern about the
radical change of things at my
current Mater.

I think it was either
Shakespeare or Jesus (they al-
ways have the best quotes) who
said, “Be nice to each other.”

Relax. Sitback. Use your poi-
son pens to pokea hole in a can of '
beer. Then use your poison,
tongues to drink it.

Davidson, andintolerance, and the
overall tension? Many ofus, maybe
not most, have a good understand-
ing of the history that brings us to
’ thepresent, What does that have to:
do with the price of dry goods on
Main Street?
JPD: Well, Davidsonis filled with
the brightest and most gifted minds
in America, yet there is still a great
need to change the way we view
things. Until my friend put herself
in a situation where she was dis-

. criminated against, she never had

to face what I live, She was con-
cerned about her own needs, but
ideally we need to think of the
needs of others, too. I like to live
by the saying “I am, because we
are.” We ended the conversation
ona very good note, but it’ scentral
thrust was to change her percep-
tion and view discrimination as a
problem that affects us all. And
that, my friend , wasaccomplished.
A: Well, Ihave acouple of sayings
that I live by. My favorite is
“Beware of ‘Mediterranean night’
at the Commons,” ie
JPD: Word, I live by that saying as
well. Yo’, dog, I’m out, buttell “J”

en he returns from his mission
at Victoria Secret’s, “What up.”
A: Alright, peace out and good
luck on exams, and, to all those
who roam obscure parts of the
campus with us, same to you.
Peace.
