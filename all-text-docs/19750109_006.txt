Keith Jarrett’s music exem-
plifies the diverse wealth of con-
temporary young jazz.

His solo piano can sing like
Chopin, Scriabin, or Burt
Bacharach, while at its very
best sounds like only Jarrett
can. A,three record set, ‘‘Solo
Piano Concerts’’ reveals
Jarrett’s personal virtuosity as
improvisor and executor of
complex technical problems.

His numerous other albums
tell his skill as a composer and
member of a small combo.
Jarrett’s shortcomings include
several faults of contemporary
jazz as a whole: the ‘we've
done it all, what next?’ void
that is too often filled with pur-
poseless instrumental wan-

derings or sell-outs to more
popular styles of rock and soul.
The best songs on Jarrett’s
group albums are those with a
steady rhythm and a relatively
coherent melody-such as ‘‘De
Drums’’, and “Still Life, Still
Life’’--pointing the way back to
a more structured type of jazz.
“Fort Yahwuh” and ‘Gary
Burton and Keith Jarrett’’
(Burton on vibes) are both very
good albums which offer ‘a
selection of styles and
of the

techniques from all
musicians,

Dewey Redman provides a
strong tenor saw on ‘Fort Yah-

wuh”’ and on “Birth,” another
album. Charlie Haden, who has
played with a number of jazz
musicians including Ornette
Coleman, is on the string bass.
Some of the songs on these
albums are cool, easy numbers,
with good solos on sax, vibes

and piano. “Fortune Smiles’’:

features Burton on vibes solo,
as does “Grow Your Own’
Other songs, like ‘‘If The Misfits
Wear It,’’ are freer and more
experimental--looser with rhy-
thm and melody, reminiscent of
John Coltrane. But even in
these songs the beat is not as

Anti - Electric Vibes

Jarrett himself plays some
wild solos on the soprano sax on
“Fort Yahwuh’’, but they are
temporary excursions from the
form of the song. This adheran-
ce to form, however loose, is in-
dicative of the trend in much of
contemporary jazz--returning

to music that is easier to listen

to. ’

Alone, Jarrett says, is the
best way for a musician to
relate to his creation and to his
audierfce. The collection of live
performances (to small audien-
ces in Europe) reveal Jarrett at
both his strongest and weakest.

In a solo performance he
cannot hide mistakes in the
strength of the rest of the group.
And he can also shine as a great
individual performer. Most of
these concerts are improvised,
making the music,even more
remarkable in its complexity
and flawless delivery.

On a few occasions it is too ob-
vious that Jarrett is im-
provising: he will stick to
repeating a pattern (ostinato)
or chord until the listener is

“Amarcord” is one of Federico
Fellini’s better movies. While it is not
so successful as ‘The Clowns,” nor so

‘distinguished as ‘‘Variety Lights’’ and

“814,”’ it wears favorably next to ‘“‘La
Strada’’ and “Juliet of the Spirits,”
and is decidedly superior to ‘“Toby
Dammit,” ‘‘Fellini Satyricon’? and
“Fellini’s Roma.”’

(These, alas, are all the Fellini
movies I’ve seen. If North Carolina
may be called a movie-goer’s
purgatory, then Charlotte, continuing
the metaphor, is an absolute dam-
nation. )

In “Amarcord,’ Fellini and _ his
editor of the last few years Ruggers
Mastroianni abandon the loose,
casual form they experimented with
for the most part so usuccessfully in
“Fellini’s Roma,” and mold a precise
mise-en-scene.

Like ‘‘Fellini Satyricon’ and
“Felini's Roma,’ ‘Amarcord’ is
unorganized and episodic. Within an
episode, each shot seems to follow the
preceding one for sound logical and
emotional reasons, but the movie
never comes together as a dramatic
whole.

lost as it was in the sixties.

‘Amarcord’

flatly contradict one another.
“Fellini Satyricon’”’ is a black

- comedy, almost a camp comedy;

Fellini intends to make a film that ©

laps over the viewer, a film in which
the viewer can lose himself, as in a
gentle sea; but there is a vast dif-
ference between a film in which the
director loses himself and one in
which the viewer can lose himself.

Despite all Mastroianni’s and
Fellini’s exertions to conceal the fact,
Fellini had no idea where he was
going while shooting ‘‘Amarcord.”’

Fellini’s approach to film-making is
to shoot a movie as though it were
many separate movies and to try to
discover order later in the editing
room, where he workd alongside the
film’s official editor.

In ‘814,’ a miracle of a film, Fellini
and Leo Catozzo find their order with
a vengeance; “‘Amarcord’’ has no
real order, only apologies and excuses
for lack of order. ge

Still, ““Amarcord’”’ comes as a relief
after the aesthetic lieing of ‘Fellini
Satyricon,” where the director’s per-
sonality and the demands of the movie

a

“Amarcord,’’ a white.comedy, a com-
dey in both senses of the word.
“Amarcord” takes the comic vignette
of Fellini’s schooldays at the opening
of ‘‘Fellini’s Roma’’—one of the best
things about that movie--and bloats it
out into a feature-length film.

A couple of the same aetors play
teachers in both. Repetition and
redevelopment are the life-blood of
art, but Fellini, I’m afraid, is mostly
stagnating.

He has always had a talent for
comedy--the talent is not completely
dead in parts even of ‘“‘Toby Dammit”’
and ‘‘Fellini Satyricon.’’

There are some funny moments in
“Amarcord,’’ as when Aurelio (Ar-
mando Brancia) tries to regain his
dignity in fromt of the neighbors bet-
ween spasms of shouting at his son.
Large sections of the movie, however,
are dull, and a few moments are pain-
fully arch.

In one of the dullest segments, a
young boy dressed like little Red
Riding Hood walks through a dense
.fog on his way to school. Shadows of
dead trees and wrecked ships loom
beside the road.

One of the shadows turns out to be a
gentle bull, but the lad, not knowing it
gentle, drops his mouth and edges
carefully past, before running safely
off to school.

The scene illustrates clearly-—all too
clearly--the nature of Fellini’s direc-
torial personality. He is a childlike
man looking with nostalgia on the
days of his youth.

He makes cozy fairy takes based
upon his memories and dreams. While
he sometimes pretends to be
ferocious, he is about as dangerous as
an old grandmother playing bogey-
man and laughing, ‘‘Boo!”’

He satirizes the excesses of the
Catholic Church, but one has no doubt
that he actually loves the excesses
and is a devout Catholic himself.
Many of the worst performances in
his films are in the roles of nym-
phomaniacs and old men, for these

Soa. ae ae eee e>

are the people he least understands.

(That Fellini’s last two films have
been rated R is one more example of
the literal-mindedness of our nations
censors. )

The scene of the boy walking to
school is a cliched expression of
Fellini’s poetic vision, and therefore a
meaningless one.

A few moments in ‘‘Amarcord’’ are
more sublimally expressive--for
example, a shot of a peacock flying
through a snowy sky and another of
sparrows pecking at a show-covered
ground in front of a small tree with
large, bright apples.

Fellini’s is a gaudy, Christmas-card

art, but that is part of the wonder of it.

Most of the performanées in ‘“‘Amar-
cord,’’ though fine, are hampered
because Fellini does not always have
a clear conception of the style he is
searching for. Magali Noel, as Gran-
disca (Italian slang for a_ well-
developed woman), finds a style that
expresses ‘“‘Amarcord”’ at its best.

She overdresses in a theatrical way
and walks with a sexless, graceful
waddle. She is sweet, playful and
smiling, and she cries while thinking
of her love life, while seeing the lights
of a boat at night or wile getting
marries, which she does at the end of
thefilm.

One sequence is luminous with
greatness, the hotel sequence, and it
too.is a Memory. Even within the

sfilm’s pregent-tense, it takes place in
\" This sequence forms a direct line
fromhe Princess’ memories of an ec-
clesiastical fashion show in ‘‘Fellini’s
Roma’’.and the moment in ‘The
Clowns’’ when the ‘young Fellini
wakes up before dawn and rushes to a
balcony from which he sees a circus
tent being raised.

-In Fellini’s movies, melancholy and
sentimentality are virtues. If Fellini
believes he has better things to) do
with his time than to make successful
movies, as I suspect he must, then he
and I have a belief in common.

driven to restless boredom. But
this mistake is seldom made,
and a possibly boring pattern is
often amazingly set as
background for flowing
provisations.

And the music remains jazz.
Jarrett can play in any style,
but hé’always ends up giving his
pieces a characteristically jazz
sound, hinting into blues, or
rag, or anumber of modern jazz
piano styles.

On these solo records the sen-
sual beauty of the piano itself is
as welcome to my over elec-
trified ears as the mastery of
the instrument Jarrett
provides. At times he can be
heard humming along as he
plays--like Glenn Gould, totally
absorbed in the music.

The personal communication
between artist-improviser and
audierice is close, due to the
inherent nature of jazz as par-
tially spontaneous and use of as
few electric and celluloid in-
termediaries as possible.

Jarrett says he is waging an
anti-electric music campaign.
The solo performances are
strong testament ¢o this fact. An
album with particular interest
in light of this statement is one
of Jarrett’s latest releases,
“Ruta & Daitya.”’

Featured on this record is the
duo of Jarrett and Jack
DeJohnette (on percussion). A
few of the songs on this record,
‘‘Algeria’’, and ‘‘Overture,”’’
luckily the shorter ones, have
Jarrett on the eletric piano and
organ. The songs come off little
better than some of Herbie Han-
cock’s latest jazz-pop: Get back
to the piano.

Jarrett’s electric songs are
interesting in their rhythmic
play with the various beats
produced by DeJohnette, but
there is little beauty in the
sounds percolating from the in-
struments. The album is
beautifully saved by the other
numbers, particularly the title
song and ‘Sounds of Peru,’’
creative combinations of piano
and drums.

Here Jarrett adds another
dimension to the versatility of
the piano, its qualities as a per-
cussion instrument, On certain
songs the piano will ac-
company DeJohnette as
almost another drum, then veer
into a melodious solo with the

drums providing background.

Jarrett also plays the flute on
this album, again displaying his
growing versatility with in-
struments other than the piano.
“Ruta & Daitya’’ shows how in-
novative a musician can be on
the instrument with which he is
most skilled, as well as bran-
ching out into other areas of ex-
pression. And the record is not a
sell out to electricity to attract a

im-

. larger listening audience.

Keith Jarrett is the pianist to
watch in contemporary jazz.
And this fact may partially ac-
count for his relative obscurity
if compared to other young
keyboard men like Herbie Han-
cock and Chick Corea, or even
Keith Emerson. Jarrett’s music
cannot be hyphenated with
rockor-pop.  .

His music is classically jazz
in its styles, forms and
freedoms. Modern jazz is foun-
ded on the intimacy between the
performer, whether small com-
bo or individual, and his audien-
ce. Jarrett’s group recordings
obtain this feeling by their
relaxed, easy style.

And his solo performances
are even stronger because of
the instrument itself, and. his
own great talent with it.
