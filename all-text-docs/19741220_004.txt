Changing Of The Guard

The SGA elections this week not
only mark the commencement of new
terms of office for many capable
students, but the graduation of many
dedicated, hard-working leaders
from important campus positions.

We can ask no more of newly-
elected SGA President John Munce
than that he show the same degree of
integrity and dedication that Blain
Butner has displayed during the past
year. @:

In reading the campaign platforms
of both Munce and Rick Roylance, the
student body is aware of the issues
which face students, and especially
the SGA Senate, during the coming
year.

We encourage Munce to firmly con-
front those problerms concerning
:ampus psychological counseling ser-
vices, student housing, the laundry,
campus food services, the College
Union, the social system and the
Davidson community. We are hopeful
that Munce will be able to initiate and
coordinate meaningful student action
in the year ahead.

As Michael Tanner completes his
year as editor of THE DAVID-
SONIAN with this issue, we also
recognize the role of this paper in
presenting and defining the issues
which Davidson must confront. Tan-
ner’s personal efforts and his recruit-
ment and training of a large staff to
succeed him will make this duty more
realistically accomplishable.

We are particularly appreciative in
retrospect, of the work of John White
during the past year as YM/WCA
president. The strengthening of the
ties between the college and the town,
especially through the Ada Jenkins
Center,owes much to his personal ef-
forts. The Y Depot Thursday af-
ternoon luncheons, which White
recently organized as a means of

solidifying the many disparate
groups which seek positive changes in
Davidson, also has tremendous poten-
tial.

Indispensable to White’s ad-
ministration has been the work of
Kenny Eiler as director of the STEP
program and that of Gary Stewart in
planning a coffee house for the Duvid-
son community in the depot.

We congratulate Sue Cunningham
on her recent election as Y president,
We anticipate the beginning of a suc-
cessful Davidson community coffee
house and increased student in-
volvement in the Ada Jenkins and

‘other community programs during

her administration.

Through the efforts of College
Union Board President Frazier Mar-
sh, persons such as William F.
Buckley Jr., Buckminster Fuller,
Dick Gregory and Daniel Berrigan
have graced the Davidson campus.
Programming entertainment at
Davidson will probably always be a
controversial subject, yet we feel that
Marsh deserves praise for his efforts.
in providing Davidson with an ad-
mirable union program.

We encourage newly-elected Union
Board President Richard Wassen to
begin immediately a strong social
and co-curricular program for the
college community.

Editorial space limitations leave us
with names of many unsung heroes
whose contributions to Davidson are
no less impressive than the work of
those mentioned above.

We highly appreciate’ the
motivation which has called these
leaders to offer to Davidson College a
fulfilling experience complementary
to strict academics, and we an-
ticipate increased activity from those
who have accepted positions of
responsibility for the coming year.

Artist-In-Residence

The Davidson campus is rarely so
warmed with the presence of a guest
as it was when Simon Bourgin visited
here last week.

Besides delivering. several in-
formative talks, Bourgin livened the
discourse in several classes he at-
tended. Socializing with many cam-
pus groups (he even made the Thurs-
day night trek to Hattie’s), he
demonstrated to Davidson the real
possibility of increased interaction
between guest speakers and the
student body.

We urge the College Union Board to
think seriously about the: artist-in-
residence concept as they program in
the future.

We feel that Bourgin’s availability
after his lectures to discuss issues
and to socialize with the members of
the college community made him a
far greater asset to Davidson than
those speakers who spend only e-
nough time here to deliver a lecture
and catch their plane out of Charlotte.

We are grateful to the Woodrow
-Wilson Senior Fellows Program for
sharing Bourgin with us for the-week,
and we look forward to more
programming in the future which
allows for the establishment of
similar relationships betwe.n the
college community and distinguished
guests. :

Newspaper Depicts
Changing Attitude

Only a few seniors probably
remember the old days of
THE DAVIDSONIAN. In the
fall of 1971, the paper was

ed by a small, close-
knit staff which was respon-
sible for most of the print shop
work as well as the actual
writing.

THE DAVIDSONIAN‘S em-
phasis was clearly on campus
political issues. Rich Wilson
devoted column after coulmn
to governance, the lingering
social system question, the in-
fant Honors College, and the
remote possibility of
coeducation.

In the fall of 1971, THE
DAVIDSONIAN varied in
length from 6 to 10 pages
weekly. Printing was done on
hot lead, seriously restricting
the form and flexibility of the

paper.

Together with news, sports
was a major focus. Those
were the days when people
seemed more interested in ex-
tensive,* in-depth sports
coverage. Who can forget all
those five-column Joe Earle

‘ headlines: DAVE FAGG:

EVERYMAN'‘S COACH.
It goes almost without

Saying that the features sec-

tion of THE DAVIDSONIAN
hardly existed. Aside from let-
ters to the editor and the week-
affronts of Cecil Burney and
Gray Wilson, there was no
features coverage.

In short, it seemed that
every event at Davidson took
place either in a Chambers
meeting room or in the
proximity of Johnston Gym.

Of course, things are dif-
ferent now. The news section
remains essential because
new issues arise, but THE
DAVIDSONIAN has expanded
to give a greater variety of
students than before the chan-
ce to contribute.

We have printed book
reviews, movie reviews, more
student columns than ever, as
well as human interest stories
from the greater Davidson
community.

In short, one might say that
THE DAVIDSONIAN is no

¢ 2. ¥ a li

longer strictly a tabloid
newspaper; it has become a
tabloid magazine of sorts.
This will continue. New
editorial plans include space
for creative student writing
and greater doses of the full-
page feature and news article.

Why has this been done?
The answer is simply that the
staff felt like it. The purpose of
THE DAVIDSONIAN is of
course to report the news and
to provide a vehicle for
student expression, but above
all, it is to give the staff the op-
portunity to express its views
and to give voice to whatever
student opinion it chooses.

I hope that in the future
THE DAVIDSONIAN will
always respect the standards
of responsible journalism, but
I hope it makes it clear that if
it seems to reflect a minority
student opinion, this is
because it is the work of a
minority group.

It is true that the DAVID-
SONIAN is funded partly with
student money, butthis cannot
be used as an argument that it
should be the “voice of the
student body’’. Its purpose is
to maintain an identity of its
own.

Only. in this way can it con-
tinue to be an effective forum
for expression. Frankly, the
opinions of the student body
have no place in THE DAVID-
SONIAN if they conflict with
those of the editors.

Over the past four years, the
forum style, and emphasis of —
THE‘ DAVIDSONIAN has
been changed and modified
time and again. Always these
changes have represented the
have, represented the
changing attitudes of the
editors alone and this should

I hope that in the future
THE DAVIDSONIAN will
always produce \the finest

quality paper that conditions
permit. I also hope that it will
consider every innovation and
issue carefully. Yet in the end
I hope that the editors will rely
on their own opinions and
judgment.
