One day during Spring Break I
was preparing for a jog by follow-
ing Denise Austin’s stretches on
ESPN. Ready to run out the door,
_T heard something that jolted my
train of thought. I was reaching to
turn off the power of the TV set
when she said it. But first she
gazed into the camera and made
me promise that I would say it, too,
“at least four or five times a day.”
“Four simple words to make
you happy again,” she said with a
gleaming smile. “Say them with
me and believe: I am worth it!”
You are worth it! Iam worth
it! I’m okay, you’re okay,
everyone’s okay. Change the way
you think, and you will change the
way you feel. Relax. Visualize
your desires. Think positive. Stop
those negative thoughts. Partici-
pate in any other mild form of self-
hypnosis. See how easy itis? You,
too, can write self-help books. But
please don’t trick yourself into
thinking that any of these tech-
niques will actually work.
Across the country, the self-
help movement has invaded our
privacy, pervaded our homes and

Stop the insanity:
The truth about self-help

permeated our lives through tele-
vision, radio, magazines, books,
and seminars. Behind every group
of people who come together to
confront human conflict lies a book
preaching self-oriented empower-
ment. The types of groups range
from political to social to spiritual;
they address the needs of people
with any kind of illness, disability,
or addiction, or of people who have
shared a difficult experience or
situation.

Self-help groups have formed
for minorities, insomniacs, ciga-
rette users, homosexuals, bulimics,
cancer and HIV-infected patients
and children of divorce, to name a
few. Popular groups include De-
ployed Parents in Operation Desert
Storm, Caregivers of Frail Elderly
Veterans, and Self-Help for the
Jobless. Join "Networks Empower
Employees," and achieve a higher
self-esteem in the workplace. Even
Alcoholics Anonymousand the 12-

step recovery program use self-
help books, such as, 12 steps’ Heal-
ing Ourselves and Our Planet.

The admirable attempts of
these self-help groups, however,
are misdirected and therefore ulti-
mately unsuccessful. You would
expect the people who work in the
pop-psychology field to be terribly
well-adjusted types, ona first name
basis with their feelings, assertive
rather than aggressive, bursting
with self-esteem, equally nurtured
and nurturing in their relationships,
and free of stress, phobias and anxi-
eties. However, one editor of a
publishing company of self-help
books was so motivated by ob-
serving her co-workers that she
wrote an article inNewsweek prov-
ing just the opposite point.

Is it any coincidence. that the
authors of these books generally
suffer more than anyone else from
the very problems about which they
write? Take for example the au-

Pornography leads to a greater future.

Wat if you don’t know what to
do? In almost any situation this is
a scary thought. If you’re talking
about sex, it’s even scarier.

By looking at and reading por-
nographic magazines, people are
quickly introduced to correct sexual
behavior, In this way, they are

introduced to the good and the bad
sides of sex. Pornography, for this
reason, should be allowed, encour-
aged, and even sold to people who
are “under age.”

For many years, men and
women have found sexual enter-
tainment in various types of por-
nography. Women, especially,
have found it fulfilling to please
the male population by posing for
magazines. Their satisfaction is
clearly seen when you look at their
smiling faces and playful poses.

These talented mod-

If a widespread increase in the
circulation of pornographic mate-
rial were to take place, men would
have many more job openings.

However, as long as there are
restrictions on the sale of these
magazines, the number of jobs for
both men and women will be lim-
ited. If more places would sell the
magazines and anyone could buy
them, their demand would increase.
As a result, new magazines would
beinvented, more wouldbe printed,
and they would have to be pro-
duced more often.

This large increase in the pro-
duction of the literature would open
up huge opportunities for willing
models.: This could be a first step
for aspiring models and young ac-
tors and actresses. The mass pro-
duction of magazines would allow

rupts the minds of young people
into thinking that sex with anyone,
not just a spouse, is fine. Also,
some would say that many people
who concern themselves with por-
nography early in life turn out tobe
criminals, such as Ted Bundy, or
that pornography might promote
violence. These “problems,” how-

ever, aren’t really problems at all. .

Let’s examine them for a sec-
ond. Children wouldn’t necessar-
ily think sex with anyone was fine.
Would they have sex with a pros-
titute who might have AIDS or any
othersexually transmitted disease?
I think not.

Let’s face it, though, sex is a
natural instinct! Everyone wants
to have sex sometime, so why not
prepare the person for a possible
unexpected, early encounter? This

erywhere, men are lusting

magazines wouldn’t be so high.

However, pornography is not
just a few pictures to drool over.
These magazines are entertaining,
yes, but they improve sexual per-
formance, as well. Through the
stimulating articles, the main rea-
son the magazines are bought, the
American population is enlight-
ened. New positions, fun games,
and new attitudes gained from them
make sex much more enjoyable
and create a large demand for the
material.

With the demand for porno-
graphic material, there are always
a few jobs open. Any female with
a decent body anda fair face can be
used in new issues of pornographic
magazines.

It is really unfair, though, that
men don’t have the same job op-
portunities in this area right now.

for more businesses and manufac-
turing plants, and it would even
open up jobs for the avenge per-
son.

Lastly, the magazines could
be used as a self-educating tool for
younger children. By looking at
the pictures, they could familiarize
themselves with the female (or
male) anatomy. By observing dif-
ferent positions of copulating
couples, they could formulate an
idea of how their sexual encoun- .
ters will take plade. These children
would prepare themselves for their
sexual activity, later on in life,
with their spouses. Through the
studying of pornography, they
would be better partners and feel
more comfortable when in those
situations.

I can see how some people
could argue that there are a few
problems with pornography. Many
would say that pornography cor-

cate it. Good teaching at home
solves the “future criminals” argu-
ment.

Anyway, how do we really
know the root of such criminals’
evil was pornography? Chances
are that they would have been
criminals anyway. These people
just can’t accept responsibility, and
they’re trying to put the blame on
something else. Pornography looks
like a great scapegoat because not
everyone has realized its full value.

Many things that aren’t fully
accepted are completely rejected.
Pornography seems to be one of
these things. Not everyone sees its
amazing value.

Once people see the educa-
tional value, job opportunities, and
preparation for the future which
pornography provides, people will
open their eyes and accept it. Por-
nography is the key to a greater
future.

Self-help techniques do not
work because they ask us to search
inside ourselves for what can only
be found in God. Since faith in
God has been substantially marred
by His own alleged death, as pro-
claimed by Nietzsche and his fol-
lowers, we as a nation have had to
look inward to find strength. Self-
help calls us to depend on our-
selves for empowerment, rather
than to turn to God in weakness.
That is idolatry. I am not sur-
prised, however, at this trend. Is
self-redemption not usually our
natural substitute for Christ?

The truth is, whether genu-
inely spiritual, professionally ac-
ceptable, or embarrassingly naive,

empowerment does not work, ex-

The reason Saturday Night
Live’s Stuart Smalley is so hysteri-
cal is that he isnot good enough, he
is not smart enough, and in fact, no
one likes him. We have all had
feelings like his at some point or
another, and what fails to work for
Stuart will not work for us. We can
find no easy way out; we cannot
“think” our problems away. Nei-
thercan we be “successful” at deal-
ing with the wretchedness of our
humanity without turning to God.
Within ourselves lies a defi-
cient pool of resources, patheti-
cally incapable of facing life’s chal-
lenges. When we try to be strong
“by looking within,” we will only
be weaker than when we began. In
the face of our insufficiency, how-
ever, stands a sufficient God, want-
ing to meet us in the center of our
need. Ourhope in times ofstruggle,
then, must come from the knowl-
edge that the very purpose of the
life of Christ was to overcome the
threat of death; a boost of self-
esteem cannot compare.

lent to radon and asbestos by label-
ing it a “Class A carcinogen.”

However, as I will discuss,
this study represents not only ques-
tionable science, but outright ly-
ing. It is this report, and the typi-
cally ignorant and biased treatment
of it by the mainstream media, that
has paved the way for such dictato-
rial legislation as the Clinton plan.

The June 23, 1993 Washing-
ton Post, however unintentionally,
gives us some perspective on this.
The Post talks of how the EPA
used acontroversial scientific tech-
nique called meta-analysis to do
their report. This method “com-
bines the results ofnumerous small
studies to reach a broader conclu-
sion that might not be justified by
any single one.” Apparently, the
EPA conducted thirty small stud-
ies and obtained the results they
desired by arbitrarily picking and
choosing among them.

The EPA also expanded the
acceptable margin of error in their
studies from five to ten percent
because, if a five percent margin
had been used, only six of their
studies would have found “an as-
sociation between environmental
smoke and cancer.” However, with
the expanded margin, the EPA still

found relatively inconclusive re- -

sults. Then, taking a gigantic leap
of faith, they found which statis-
tics they were looking for and pub-
lished them in this report. There
was no mention of the contradic-
tory nature of their data, nor was
there any justification for their odd
scientific techniques.

Even more revealing, though,
is-that these studies “concerned
home, not workplace, exposure to ~
ETS.” This means that attempts to
correlate secondhand smoke with
cancer essentially failed even in
homes, where the exposure is mul-
tiplied. Basically, this under-re-
ported EPA flop means that you
could sit in the Commons with me
three meals a day forever (and my
meals are long) and you would not
be affected by my smoke. The
EPA did prove, however, that if
you lived with me over a long “
period of time, the chance of you
being affected is still only 1 in 5 (6
out of 30 studies). This “authorita-
tive” declaration is not worth the
paper it’s written on.

Let us not ignore the fact that
two out of every three non-smok-
ers believe that separate smoking
sections are better than a ban (USA
Today), or that the American Jour-
nal of Public Health reports that
restaurant smoking sections greatly
minimize the exposure to smoke in *
the non-smoking areas. :

These strident anti-smokers
who quiver with self-righteous in-
dignation at the sight of a cigarette
rest on this fatally flawed EPA
report like a crutch when they an-
grily write their congressmen and

_complain about their secondhand

smoke intake.

Basically, leave me alone. If
you don’t like smoke, sit in the
non-smoking section or go some-
where else. Don’t fraudulently
trumpet the merits of a meaning-
less report, and, most importantly,
don’t try to tell business people «
and mature adults what to do.
