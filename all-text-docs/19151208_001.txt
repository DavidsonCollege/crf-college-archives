Varsity Basket Ball
Begins This Week

Several Games to be Played Be-
fore the Holidays.

Basket ball is receiving more attention
this year at Davidson than ever before
due to the fact that practice has begun
before Christmas and that this vear we
have a coach for the whole season. We
are very fortunate in having Mr. De-
Witt Kluttz. who is thoroughly familiar
with the game and who has had success
in coaching both at Woodberry Forest
and Carolina.

The team has been very muc
strengthened by the addition of some of
the foot ball men to the squad. A short
time ago the team. minus the foot ball
men, was defeated by the fast Statesville
team by the close score of 25 to 26, but
this game does not count on the series to
be played with that team beginning here
on the 8th.

Manager Hill is arranging a very at-
tractive schedule which will include
practically every college in the State.
some of the leading Y. M. C. A.’s and
some colleges in South Carolina. The
first game of the season is with States-
ville, Tuesday night, on the local floor.
Statesville has a strong quint composed
of ex-college plavers, and cither team
will have to go the limit to win.

On Saturday, December 18, Trinity
comes for a game. Trinity is always a
contender for State championship, and
can he counted on to have a crack team.
This year they are scheduled to plav
University of Virginia and several
Northern schools.

ORDER OF THE GRYPHONS.

According to the announcement which
was made last Commencement. the Or-
der of the Gryphons will in the. future

be comnosed of men from the Senior,

Class whose identity will not be known
on the campus during the year, and an-
nouncement of the membership for the
preceding year will only be made at
Commencement.

The value of the order will be in the
work which it, as an order. or through
its individual members, will be able to
do for the college, and the students, at
the end of the year, must judge as to the
merit of this work.

BLUE PENCIL CLUB MEETING.

The Blue Pencil Club. which is the
Davidson Chapter of the Sigma Upsilon,
held a meeting on Wednesday. the No-
vember 24, at which time five new mem-
bers were added. Membership in this
club is limited to members of the Senior
Class, and the work of the club is to en-
courage literary interests at Davidson.

The new men added to the club this
Fall have heen: S. B. Hay. S. M. Crisp.
Tr.. 1. L. Pavne, William Hollister and
W. A. Dumas.

A very interesting literary program
was given by the new members, and
after a general discussion of matters of
interect to the club, refreshments were
served,

Students returning after Christmas
will report to the treasurer bv 6 p. m. of
the onening dav. Anv_ matriculating
later than this will be charged a delayed
registration fee of $2.00.

“Colonel” Scofield to
Discontinue Business

DAVIDSON COLLEGE. DAVIDSON. N. C., DECEMBER §8, 1915.
Letters Are Awarded

Class Basket Ball
Series Is Concluded

After Forty-Five Years at Popular |Sophs Are Declared the Wianers---

Local Stand.

Public announcement was made De-.
| cember 1 that S. C. Seofield. Davidson's

famous “Colonel.” would retire from
business with the passing of the year
1915. The Colonel, or “Skit.” as the
boys call him, has for forty-five years
held forth as the center of attraction for
the students during their leisure hours.
at “Skit’s Corner.” and they look upon
the closing of his store with genuine re-
great. It is the passing of a landmark.

Mr. Scofield moved to Davidson in
1857, from Columbia, S.C. His fath-
er, a contractor, had received the con-
tract for the construction of the historic
Chambers building, and it stands a monu-
ment to his labors. The material was
all taken from the immediate vicinity.
and even the brick were made in David
son. The total cost was $85,000. ‘The
valuation today is much above that
figure.

At the completion of the task, the
family moved by wagon to IIlinois,
where they remained during the war.
During this period his father died. and
Mrs. Scofield and her son returned to
Davidson, in 1867. In 1870, the little
grocery and confectionery store had its
beginning, and into its coffers began to
flow all the spare “jitneys” from the
campus. As he himself expresses it. ‘Tn
the meantime, T got married.” and for
over forty years (until her recent death)
he and Mrs. Scofield have occupied the
same little home, connected with the
store.

Mr. Scofield was the builder of the
linen mill. andalso helped lav out the
telegraph lines in this community. For
vears he was the efficient station agent
for the railway ‘company, until health
canfined him more closely to his home.
He was employed in the building of
both the Y. M. C. A. building and the
church. and has probably done more in
“upbuilding” of Davidson than anv
other of its citizens.

The Colonel's health makes it neces-
sarv for him to give up active business
life. The stack of goods is to be re-
duced through regular sale over the
counter. instead of being continued un-
der different awnershin. For the pres-
ent the store itself will remain vacant.
Colorel Scofield has not decided whether
he will remain in Davidson or not, but
it seems probable that he will.

With the closing of the doors. the
familiar figure of the Colonel. with his
old black slouch hat and the inevitable
cigar, playing checkers with the boys,

All-Class Team Is Picked.

By the cancellation of all the remain
ing games in the class basket ball series,
the Sophs have been acclaimed the win
ners of the series for this season.  “Vhe
season as a whole has been verv success
ful, and many hard and exciting games
have been plaved.

The Sophomore quintet, captained by
Sprunt, has shawn itself in’ every wav
worthy of the honors bestowed upon it.
‘The Freshmen, with Hali as) captain.
have a good steady team, although not as
strong a one as was expected at the first
of the vear. The Seniors, with Dumas
as captain, have an especially fast team,
and their team work and passing was
one of the main features of the season.
The Juniors seem to have been marked
with “hard luck” in some of the games,
and although their plaving was game
and spirited throughout, it seems that
luck and light weight combined against
them.

The average weights of the different
teams are approximately as follows:
Seniors, 150 pounds: Tuniors, 138
pounds: Sophs, 1§7 pounds: Fresh, 152
pounds.

The standing of the teams at the end
of the season is as foliows:

ou. Lost. Pet,
Sophs 2. 2. 6. 6. 1 800
Fresh .. ror 4 .§00
Tuniors . 7 ww. 3 4 430
Seniors .. 6.0... 3 4 430

The class teams wish to express their
thanks to Perry, "16; Reese, 't7; and
Childs. 18; for their services in referee:
ing the games.

The following all-class team has been
nicked by several of the Varsity men:
King. of Sophs; Perry, of Seniors, For-
wards. Murray, of Juniors: Therrell,
of Sophs, Guards, Williamson, of
Fresh, Center.

The following men were also recom-
mended, and should be mentioned: Nis-
het. of Juniors. Forward: Worth. of
Sophs, Guard; Dumas, of Seniors, Cen-
ter.

telling reminiscences: of the early days.
“gibing” the Freshmen, and grumbling
at the light trade, becomes a pleasant
memory with hundreds of Davidson
alumni,

The “dope a la’ peanut” drink is a
thing of the past. and the rising classes
will find the old college without _ its
memorable “loafing” place and the fa-
miliar “Skit.”

To Foot Ball Men

Executive Committe Gives D. to
Twelve and D. C. to Eighteen.

The awarding of twelve D.'s and
eighteen D, C.’s marked the ciose of one

only five of last year’s D. men back—
two line .and three backfield. By Sep-
tember 25, Coaches Fetzer and Kluttz
had worked into shape a 150 pound team
that held Washington and Lee 14 to 0,
and two weeks later won praise from
the Atlanta papers. for its excellent
showing against Georgia ‘Tech,  Out-
weighed in every game. plaved, the little
Red and Black Machine won 4 games.
tied 1 and lost 3: scored 24 touchdowns
to their opponents’ 17.

When we look back over the past few
months to find the causes for the season's
success, everything points to one reason:
the excellent coaching staff.

While we are praising the Varsity, let
us not forget those men who helped te
make the Varsity what it was. namely,
the Scrubs. Too much cannot be said
of these men for their loval efforts.
