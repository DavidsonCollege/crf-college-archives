Davidson’s men’s cross coun-
try team traveled north Saturday
for the Delaware Invitational in
Newark.

MEN’S CROSS

COUNTRY

The Wildcats finished fourth
in a field that consisted of 75 run-
ners from four other schools, in-
cluding Navy, Hofstra, Bucknell
and Delaware.

Because it had rained heavily
the night before, the hilly course
was still a little wet at the 10:30
race time. The meet was won by
Bucknell with a low score of 19
points.

Sophomore Josh Cookson
lead the Wildcats. Cookson fin-
ished in 16th place with a time of
27:24 for the five-mile race.

“T felt strong today; it was a
perfect day for running,” Cookson
said. He also said that he felt it was
his strongest performance to date.

Junior captain Dave Foss fin-
ished second for the Wildcats and
32nd overall in 28:05. Rounding
out the top five for Davidson were

sophomores Tripp Franklin and
Tim O’Keefe and freshman
Jonathan Fly.

Also running for Davidson
were Buddy Myers, Eric
Collings, Keith Gordon, and
Wilson Walker.

“We did not run as well as
we had hoped as a team, but the
seasonis still young,” says Coach
Gary Andrew. “It would have
been nice to run faster today but
the conference meet is the one
that really matters.”

The Wildcats next race is
Saturday at the Greensboro Invi-
tational at Hagan Stone Park in
Greensboro.

The Woodsman’s Checklist

By JOHN ROE
Outdoors Columnist

I have compiled a list of the
little things you probably didn’t
know about the laws of the great
outdoors, so take careful notes.
The next time you enter the woods,
don’t say I didn’t warn you!

THE GREAT

OUTDOORS

The next time you and. your
buddies are setting traps, here are
some helpful hints: remember that
it is unlawful to trap furry wood-

land critters with a steel-jaw or
leg-hold trap, unless, of course,
your trap contains a shock absorb-
ing device approved by the Com-
mission.

Also, remember that it is un-
lawful to use a snare so that ani-
mals or birds will be suspended
when caught. Unfortunately, you
can no longer enjoy cutting your
catch out of the tree, but we woods-
men can make the necessary sacri-
fices, right?

For all bow hunters, the next
time you draw back the bow-string,
make sure you arrowhead is not
drugged, barbed, poisoned or
rigged to explode on contact. -

Believe it or not, it is still

unlawful to take waterfowl by
means of battery gun, fishhook,
explosive or any stupefying de-
vice. But don’t pawn your weap-
ons of mass destruction just yet.
I hear that next year this regula-
tion might fall through!

Also, be careful not to goon
those drunken binges and drive
around in a corn field with your
guns. They could not only get
you on rallying or chasing birds
in a motorized vehicle, but they
could also slap ona hefty fine for
hunting in a baited field as well.
What are we woodsmen to do
now when we have the urge to
drink, shoot guns and go muddin’
around in a corn field?

The men’s soccer team has
been on a roll, having won their
first three Southern Conference
games, and is heading into a show-
down with highly-ranked Duke on
Tuesday with a junior emerging as
one of the leading scorers in the
nation.

MEN’S SOCCER

Forward Robert Clarke scored
10 goals in a four-game stretch
from Sept. 10-19. Through Sept.
17, Clarke was tied for first in the
NCAA in scoring with nine goals
and zero assists, and he was alone
in first in goals scored.

“The goals have come because
of everyone else on the team, and
because we have been playing sub-
par competition,” Clarke said. “It
just so happens that I have been in
the right spot. Both Phil Julien and
Bryce Jewett are capable of doing
the same exact thing.”

Friday, Nick Troiano was the
only Wildcats player able to score
inthe Umbro Invitational at UNCC
as Davidson fell to Portland (Ore.)
4-1. The Wildcats played in the
final game of the tournament Sun-
day against St. Mary’s (Calif.).
With Friday’s loss, the Wildcats
dropped to 5-3-1.

Coach Charlie Slagle said the

team had really gotten on a roll
during the games in which Clarke
was hot.

“People say it’s been [the
wealth of goals] against weaker
teams, but we have struggled
against those same teams in the
past,” Slagle said. “You can tell
from the scores we’re not having
trouble now.”

Some of those scores include
identical 6-1 wins over The Cita-
del and VMI and a 3-1 win over
Georgia Southern last Tuesday.
Clarke scored three goals in each
game and now has 12 this season.

Slagle and Clarke have differ-
ent opinions on why Clarke has
been such a successful scorer this
year and in the past.

“He is very driven,” slat

said. “When he has the ball heis—

relentless going to goal. He is great
with the ball and great at getting to
through balls.”

However, Clarke claimed that
his greatest asset is the team’s
midfield play.

“Ryan Northington and Keith
Kleeman are two of the best mid-
fielders in the south,” he said. “Be-
tween the two of them there is so
much offense created. They do all
the work and I get the glory for it.”

Unfortunately though,
Northington injured an ankle in
practice on Thursday and he will
be out for at least a few weeks and
possibly much of the rest of the
season.

VOLLEYBALL

The volleyball team had split results Saturday, beating
Tennessee-Chattanooga 15-10, 12-15, 15-8, 15-6, but
losing to UNC-Asheville 15-5, 15-5, 15-12. The Wildcats
record falls to 4-10, heading into Thursday’s home match

at 7:30 against Radford.
