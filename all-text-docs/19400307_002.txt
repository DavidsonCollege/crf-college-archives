THE GREEKS ARE REBIELLING. In-
dividual chayiters, alumni, National Pan-
Hellenic Congress, and National  Inter-

fraternity Conference are all worried about
the type of publicity which has recently
been given to fraternities and. sorerities.

The matter to weétich they refer, specifically,
material presented in pictorial “mass
consumption” magazines.

Conclusions, then, are that-it-is-a—mis-

“good advertising”, since it brings fratern-

Question Of The Week

After the announcement made in chapel
by Gales McClintock, one of the managers
of the Student Store, on the irregularities
which have occurred in the Student Store,
there have been many opinions expressed
as, how to best remedy this unfortunate in-
Accordingly, the following question
has been selected as the “Question of the

have eaten before they walk out. I would
think of the matter as forgetful-
ness and not as petty thievery. However,

because there is-nothing else for
them to do. This fault of course
