Ihe DAVIDSONIAN April 17, 1918

DAVIDSONIAN OFFICE FORCE | MAJ. McCONNELL SPEAKS

ENJOYS ANNUAL FEED

Friday evening at 9 o’clock the new
gymnasium presented an attractive scene
for those who had been assisting in the
circulation department of this publica-
tion. About twenty-five guests were
present to partake of the delicious eats
covering a long table, attrdctively bur-
dened with bananas, apples, cheese sand-
wiches, pickles, olives, candy and cakes
of three kinds. ‘he entire center of the
table was covered with peanuts. “hese
things together with some lovely flowers
created an appearance that would have
made Pluto happy. Dopes, cigarettes,
cigars and gums were passed around.
Every guest was presented with an in-
teresting souvenir in the form of an at-
tractively designed folder announcing the
occasion, and containing a statement of
the position of ‘THe Davipsonian.
Other features of the folder were the
names of the outgoing and incoming
staffs and the menu. Red and black rib-
bon formed the binding of the folders.

There were yells and jokes in abund-
ance. “he joke most enjoyed was that
told by Captain Lea on Cullum. Those
present were M. A, Siske, toast-master ;
T. C. Stone, circulation manager; Cap-
tain Lea, honorary guest; R. H. Stone,
-editor-in-chief ; W. C. Neel, C. N. Mor-
rison, M. E. Edwards, J. B. Caldwell,
N. A. Bradshaw, D. R. Freeman, ‘T. R.
Alexander, B. W. Romefelt, C.D.
Ewing, W. H. Harrel, C. A. McGirt,
G. D. Sample, C. J. Matthews, Wel-
come Cullum, E. A. ‘Furner, RD.
Hall, L. P. Good, L. W. Fishel, and
W. M. Jones.

After one hour and a half of feasting,
merriment and levity a great big: yell
was given for “Davipsonian.” Many
went away to dream dreams of cating
and frollicking, while those who had
smoked their first cigar went to beds of
unrest.

SERENITY OF DAVIDSON
IS RUDELY DISTURBED

A most interesting debate was staged
last Saturday night about 14 o'clock in
the Bushwhacker Society of North
Main street, when the subject for dis-
cussion was, “Resolved, ‘That the pro-
hibition laws are agin’ reason.” The
affirmative was represented by several
gentlemen of more or less thirsty tem-
perament, while the negative was sup-
ported by the entire police force of Da-
vidson, assisted by a division of soldiers
delegated from Camp Greene for the
especial purpose. The — affirmative
brought the following arguments, to-wit,
buckshot, pokers, skillets, and other in-
struments of domestic life. ‘he negative
replied with a. few rounds of 32-calibre
pistol fire. The police force of David-
son did valiant work, but had it not
been for the support of the army that is
fighting to make the world safe for
Democracy the decision might have been
against the forces of law and order. As
it was the fates seem to have decided in
favor of these said forces, that is to say,
a judge will have a chance to say a few
things on the matter. More medals
were presented than even in a Fresh-
Soph debate. Several gentlemen were
awarded metal, how many the judges,
or rather the doctors, have not yet de-
cided.

It is pointed out that Oliver Gold-
smith in his description of the wilds of
the South, gave us credit for many won-
derful animals that do not exist in our
fair climes. But nu longer can they
criticise old Oliver on one point: he was
right when he said there were tigers in
this fair land, which goes to prove that
poets are pretty intelligent folks after
all.

Tiger, tiger. burning bright
In the forest of the night.

What a funny, funny plight
Is a tiger without sight!

ON ARMY Y. M. C. A.

At the last regular mecting of the Y.
M. C. A., Maj. J. W. McConnell, a
former member of the Davidson Col-
lege faculty and now major in the hos-
pital corps at Camp Jackson, gave a
very interesting address on the Y. M. C.
A, work in army camps. He showed how
the camp Y. M. C. A.’s have grown
from the ugly, ill-equipped buildings of
two years ago to the splendid, well-
equipped buildings now erected in each
cantonment. He declared that the Y.
M. C. A. and the Red Cross approach
one hundred present efficiency, and that
no money given them is wasted. He de-
scribed the work of Y. M. C. A men,
and paid a high tribute to their Chris-
tianity and helpfulness.

JUNIOR-SENIOR DEBATE.

The inter-society debate between the
Junior-Senior debating teams of the two
literary sucieties will be held on Monday
April 29. “Vhe subject’ for debate is:
“Resolved, ‘Vhat Congress should enact

legislation for the compulsory arbitra-}

tion of disputes between organized labor
and corporations, constitutionality waiv-
ed.” “Phe Phi team, composed of Neel,
McClure and Currie, will uphold the
affirmative, while the negative will be
defended by Orgain, ‘Thomas and Potts,
of the Eu Society. “Phe inter-society
debating cup, which has been won by
the Phi Society for the past two years,
will be the award to the winner, and a
hotly contested debate is expected.

LE CERCLE FRANCAIS.

Critiques sur les Professeurs de Da-
vidson.

Les jeunes membres du “Cercle Fran-
cais” ont passe Vheure de conference
samedi dernier a parler en des termes
plus ou moins enthousiastes de leurs
chers professeurs. Voici quelques ex-
traits de leurs discours:

Un de nos professeurs leve les sour-
cils quand il chante, mais il chante nean
moins assez bien. Quelques-uns de nos
professeurs jouent souvent (et tres bien)
le victrola, et les autres se vantent d’au-
tres connaissances et arts d'agreement.

Les professeurs aiment a dire de peti-
tes histories pour rire plus ou moins fac-
tices ct embellies, pour nous aider a
obtenir tous les faits. Les eleves appel-
lent un des professeurs “Le Long Gar-
con,” un autre “Machine a Vapeur,” un
autre ‘Peche.” De ces messieurs neces:
saires derive son nom d'une variete cele-
bre de cafe. |

Les professeurs de Davidson sont les
plus mechants du monde, surtout le pro-
fesseur de—, let professeur de—, et le
professcur de—. Le premier. prefere

que nous etudiions tout le temps, et ne

veut jamais nous laisser le temps de nous
amuser; le second pense —evidernment
quil n'y a rien au monde excepte le sys-
teme ct la methoide, ct la necessite de
preciser toujours. Selon Ini, ce n'est que
les faits specifiques qui vaillent. Le pro-
fesseur de —s‘est absente trop souvent
apres les vacances de Noel. Il aurait du
se souvenir que nous avons pave notre
education, et que nous tenons a ce que
nous l’obtenions.

The friends of Dr. J. M. McConnell
will be glad to hear that another honor
has been conferred upon him. He has
been appointed by Governor TT. W.
Bickett as a delegate to the 27th annual
meeting of the American Academy of
Political and Social Science. The con-
ference meets in Philadelphia, April 26-
27, 1918.

G. A. Byrd, °20, left the Hill Satur-
day to accept a position with the Red-
path Chautauqua, but expects to ‘return
to college next year. t
