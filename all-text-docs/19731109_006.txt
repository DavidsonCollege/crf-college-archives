ITHAPPENS AT MIDNIGHT

Last night, I watched the
freshmen. I simply sat in the
ARA late-night-spot-to-be and,
with a limp turkey and lettuce
on white bread in my gnarled
hand, I watched the freshmen.

The first term is always the
most interesting of any year.
It is in that term that at-
titudes, policies, ideals,
promises are made for the
rest of the year.

And it is the freshman class
that determines so very much
of the coming year.

It is that new class that

forth new life to a
would-be stagnant school.
Almost overwhleming in their
fresh attitudes, they display
openness and honesty that is
so extremely genuine and so
extremely unique in this
hollow place. -

They are the bravest of
cowards, the wisest of fools.

‘‘M*A*S*H”’ contains some hairline
episodes as a team of army surgeons at-
tempt to supplement their full time
schedules at the operating table of a Korean
War mobile army surgical hospital with a
stream of exhausting diversions.

before the camera turned, the actors were
encouraged to improvise.

The comic stylization of the actors,
especially Sally Kellerman, Donald
Sutherland, Elliott Gould, Indus Arthur,
Roger Bowen and Rud Cort, are excellent as
is Director Robert Altman’s handling of his
cast generally.

The editing seems to be a valiant attempt
to save an already botched affair, reflecting
a need for more formal planning by Altman
as he was shooting “M*A*S*H”.

‘The film lacks structure and continuity,
often tending to break down into disjointed

The best American film of the year is now
playing at the Park Terrace Theater in
Charlotte, ‘American Graffiti.”

The action takes place in one night in late
August, 1962.

The characters in ‘“‘American Graffiti’’
are familiar to everyone. There's the all-
American boy, his all-American girl-friend,
the intellectual, the creep, and the
adolescent hero who never grows up.

Each one has a night during which he or
she celebrates his youth, and at the same

The best part of ‘“‘M*A*S*H” is the
climactic football sequence. Our madcap
surgeons, enticed by bets from a rival
division, decide to organize an impromptu

. football team.

The play-by-play and sidelines com-
mentary came from the cheerleading squad.
Major Hot Lips Houlihan (Kellerman) leads
the bunch, but she really doesn’t understand
the game.
fa re cae 8088 UP, she shouts
jJubilantly through her exhaustion, ‘‘A red
flag! Ared flag!”

“That’s a foul, Hot Lips, you blithering
idiot,’’ the coach responds.

The football sequence is a smashing strip
of celluloid.

Only a couple of scenes, ‘‘The Last Sup-
per’’ and ‘‘Hot Lips in the Shower,”’ manage
to approach the quality of the football

sequence.

Other than these three scenes and a few
moments saved ‘by acting, ‘“M*A*S*H”
proves to be somewhat weak, but still a fine,
friendly film.

“‘M*A*S*H”’ has been held over at the
Manor Theater in Charlotte.

‘American Graffiti’

time realizes that he or she will never have
this particular moment again.

It is an insidious film, one which traps you
in its snare of nostalgia so well that you cat-
ch yourself dreaming of a time before
college, before Nixon.

The stars, Richard Dreyfuss, Ronnie
Howard, Paul Le Mat, and Charles Martin
Smith, are all superb.

George Lucas’ direction is tight and fast-
paced. The set, the costumes, the mood are
all perfect.

This movie grabs you and stays with you
long after you leave the theater. .

Music by Chuck Berry, the Beach Boys,
etc. makes ‘‘American Graffiti’’ a standard
by which all “nostalgia” movies will be
measured,

For probably the most enjoyable time you
will have at any movie, at any time, don’t
miss ‘‘American Graffiti.”’

Unfortunately, they also
hear with open ears. What
they hear is pure David
soniana. It is the same David-
soniana that molds all to a
standard form.

It is this mold that is so very
sad about Davidson life. The
freshmen come in as in-
dividuals - as distinct per-
sonalities - and each leaves as
“The Davidson Graduate.”

Not that this label is a bad
one - attending this place for
the full four years ‘‘entitles”
one to it.

But it is time that we - ‘‘The
Soon-to-be Davidson
Graduates” - took a hard look
at that label. We need to
discern just what it means.
And we can best look at it
through the freshmen.

As was previously men-

‘tioned, they come as in-

dividuals. They bring, poten-
tially, improvement to the life
here. But the system stifles
almost immediately what in-
put they would make.

The members of the system
put strong pressure on each
freshman to study quietly,
turn an apathetic head, and be
as constantly unaware as

possible.
Even their social life - and
their enjoyment of it - is more-

or-less dictated to them.

The members of the system
soon make it very plain that
those individuals in the class
who remain individuals and
try to work to improve upon a
questionable institution will be
tagged “turkeys” or labeled
“flamers’’ or, worst of all,
simply ignorea.

And so the majority of the
freshmen do the more ex-
pediant thing - they conform.
It comes quickly. At ARA last
night I saw freshmen
emulations of the very cooly
systemized upperclassmen. »

Perhaps this undisguised
column is a waste of my
breath and your time. My
grandfather always said (and
quite correctly) that I was
“windier than a bag full of
assholes.”

But if the gentle breeze that
I create can cause only a quick
glance at what we have here
(and what we haven't), then
my hot air is perhaps justified.

The point is simple. Each
freshman comes a potential
sculptor. But he is never
given a chance to work his art.
Rather, he is poured into the
crumbling, sterile Plaster of
Paris mold that is ailingly
called Davidson College.
