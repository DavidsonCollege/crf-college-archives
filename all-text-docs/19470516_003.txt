Before closing this year’s column
Sigma Chapter extends its congrat-
ulations and best wishes for future
success to its graduating brothers,
Sim Barnwell, Shep Dunn, Jim
Jackson, Mae Jeffries, Ed Monroe,
and Buddy Whitesides.

PHI DELTA THETA

Leading the dealers of the Sword
and Shield was* Brother William
S. McLean, who rang the belle
again with a date on the blind side.
Brother Oglesby broke into_ the
win column with another blind date
which had the more social minded
set agog. Quoth Richard, “I love
that rare Egyptian type df beauty.”
Brother Miller was seen partying
after the brawl and rumor has it
that the Georgian is becoming quite
a gay blade in his Junior year on
the hill. Brothers Iverson and
Spires were on the entertainment
committee for the Agnes Scott del-
egation at the Holy City over the
week end. Will it be wedding bells
for Brother Tate? His constant
croonings of “Love on a Greyhound
Bus” must indicate something is
in the air, Brothers attending the
Phi Mu party at the river include
Turnipseed, Palmer, Sutton, Mills,
Newell, Tate, and Crumpacker.
Sutton, speaking for the group, re-
ports a wonderful time between
sneezes. Brother Starnes figured
prominently in both the dance and
the now infamous picnic gathering
sponsored by the original members
of the class of forty-five. Brother
Tate and fair companion broke all
records by attending three differ-
ent parties in one night. Brother
Johnson and Joy “I don’t wanta’
go-home’’Martin honored the chap-
. ter with their presence at dinner
on Sunday evening.

PI KAPPA ALPHA

The big function at the Red Fez
Club this past Saturday was a huge
success. Everyone there seems to
have had the biggest time yet.
Brother Double Dip McNair arrived
first and from all reports was the
last to leave. He and Tramp En-
sign assumed the duties of hosts,
and did a splendid job. Among the
couples seen dancing to Gib Todd’s
orchestra were Brothers Rogers and
Libby, Hart and Maria, Turner and
Beth, Stroup and Aileen, Big Stroup
and Lib, Gallant and Dot, Shelton
and Mary, Wester and Anne, Dock-
ery and Dottie, Leonard and Shirley
(Pinned as of Saturday night),
Jackson and Jeanne, Bell and Anna,
Hadley and Mary, Clark and Mary
Bess, and all the other Brothers
and Pledges with their “rags, bones,
and hanks of hair” (as Kipling
would have it.) Brother Chick
Neill’s, date, Winifred Jordan from
Gastonia, was elected “Dream Girl”
of Beta Chapter for 1947, and we
think it was a fine selection. All
in all, it was a glorious week end,
and it will be remembered by all
attending as such for a long time.

Stories Lauded
As for the stories, “Jungle Rot”
is about an Army deserter in the
Philippines. “Special Watch” is a
hospital misadventure. “The char-
acterization of this story was its
chief asset,” said Doctor Black-
burn, “and in this important fac-
tor of narration it was superior
to the other manuscripts submit-
ted.” In regard to Leland’s “Last
Fare” Doctor Blackburn said: “It
was superior in smoothness of style
and in development.” According
to Doctor Blackburn, the excellence
of “Jungle Rot’ lay in the struc-
tural unity and powerful scenic de-
scription which it exhibited.
Annual Affair
This year having been the first
since the war when the complemént
of the student body was up to nor-
mal, it is the first time that the
award has been presented. Here-
after the presentation of the prize
will be an annual affair.

PHI GAMMA DELTA

It seems that Brother Jenkins has
misplaced his fraternity pin some-
where. If anyone should accidental-
ly see one on the Queens Campus
please return it to Paul before it’s
too late. (Jenny could possibly
have dropped it off her blouse,
couldn’t she?) Murd asked his best
girl last week if she believed in
interdigitation before marriage,
and the sound of a gnat clipping
his toe nails on a blotter could
easily have been heard during the
silence which followed. Murd’s next
move was toward a dictionary.

Wonder if you heard the story
of the college man that went into
a tavern to have a short?? beer?
There were three of them: a Wake
Forest man, a Carolina man, and
a Davidson man. When the waiter
bought the booze, the man noticed
that there was a fly in each glass.
The Wake Forest gentleman quick-
ly handed the glass back to the
waiter and demanded another, while
the Carolina man just scooped out
the fly in his glass with his fin-
ger. The Davidson man gently
picked up his fly by the wings,
held him above the glass, squeezed
the nape of his neck, and_ said,
“Spit it out, you little rascal, spit

it out.”

ticality of which was proved by the
recent war.

In evaluating the various courses
of the college curriculum Dr. Cowl-
ing stated that social science broad-
ens one’s scope of the problems of
the social .order; natural science
makes us feel at home in the phys-
ical universe; makes

history us

aware of what went on before in

terms of man’s previous experi-
ments and experiences.
A liberal education, said Dr.

Cowling, weaves skills and abilities
into a specific end and is therefore
more: difficult. It liberates man
from mental slavery and partieu-
larly from mere obedience to in-
stinets, ° '
In conclusion, Dr. Cowling stated
that liberal and general education
are complementary in the individ-
ual and by

no means opposite in
its ends, i

Reactivation of the Aviation Cadet program is typical

of the AAF’s continuing effort to provide selected young
men every opportunity to earn ‘advancement. Cadets
who win their wings as today’s pilots will be the same
kind of men who, in wartime, built and manned the

world’s mightiest air arm.

Make your plans now to get in at the start! By apply-
ing immediately after graduation, you can take your
qualifying examinations and enter the July 1st class,

or—if you want a summer

vacation — you can take

your examinations now and be ready to enter the
class beginning October 15th. Further in-
formation is available at AAF Bases, U. 8.
