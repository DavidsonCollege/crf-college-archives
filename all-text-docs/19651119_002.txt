Import Yet To Be Seen

Davidson’s faculty has compiled
an interesting and fact-filled docu-
ment which was released this week as
the college’s first self-study report.

Student interest in the report—a
hefty, 257-page publication—has been
keen all week. Faculty interest, of
course, has been acute also, for each
professor was familiar with only the
portion of the report which he aided
in compiling.

But the value in the self-study
cannot be measured in the interest it
arouses in the college community.

Nor can it be gauged in the amount
of time that went into the preparation
of the volume. Nearly two years of
writing, figuring, surveying and lis-
tening on the part of every faculty
member at Davidson has gone into the
background of the volume.

Neither can an accurate mensura-
tion of the study’s impact here come
from the comments and evaluations of
the delegation of the Southern Asso-
ciation of Colleges arid Schools which
visited the campus for three days this
week.

What will prove to be the best indi-
cator of the value of Davidson's first
such self-study will be the dispatch
which the college uses in implement-
ing the recommendations of the re-

With Relief

Well-thinking citizens across the
state of North Carolina can well man-
age a sigh of relief this week after
long-overdue amendments to the no-
torious speaker-ban law were approv-
ed by the General Assembly Wednes-

ay.

No amount of legislative bickering
or political ameliorations can cover up
for the ingratuitous slap-in-the-face
which was presented to the leaders of
state-supported colleges by the law-
makers in the closing minutes of their
1963 session.

North Carolina, which was proudly
leading the way for the Southern
states through the ridicule thrown
from all sides by pro-integration radi-
cals, suddenly stumbled over her own
shortcomings and began to face hu-
miliation from her sister states to the
south as well.

Just how much the state’s college
students were affected is a debata-
ble point.

But the scars of derision which
were rained on students and educa-
tors alike during the notorious speak-
er-ban era cannot be erased simply
by the process of amendment.

The success of this week’s special
legislative session can be seen as a
victory for the administration of Gov.
Dan K. Moore.

The governor's political strategy in
the appointment of a special commis-
sion to study the speaker ban was

We do not expect a metamorphosis
overnight because of the release of the
report; yet, we would hope to see
smiles over the appearance of the
book be turned into looks of determi-
nation for implementing each of the
suggestions.

Adequate funds must be found be-
fore most of the items can be effected.
This does not forestall, however, the
beginning of study by the Board of
Trustees into each item mentioned in
the report.

Specific adjustments in the admin-
istrative structure of the college can
and should be effected right away.

We hope, too, that the appropriate
Trustee committees will consider the
specific chapters of the report in or-
der that forward action may be pos-
sible at the’ next meeting of the board.

We commend the faculty—particu-
larly the executive secretary of the
self-study, Dr. C. J. Pietenpol, and the
committee chairmen—for the deter-
mined effort which has resulted in
the sound recommendations of the
report.

We reiterate again, however, that
the true value of the self-study has
not yet been realized. Only when the
full resources of the college are gear-
ed toward the prompt implementa-
tion of these goals can the real import
of this self-analysis be seen.

questioned by many this summer, but
his wisdom was evidenced this week
in the sound reasoning behind the
commission's call for amending the
disreputable legislation.

Although Davidson was not affected
by the law, we have a definite inter-
est in safeguarding the avenues of
academic freedom and inquiry for
every student and teacher.

Students and professors here have
actively voiced their opposition to the
speaker ban. Davidson’s chapter of
the American Association of Univer-
sity Professors initiated a program
calling for the repeal of the law.

The local AAUP’s study has result-
ed, as THE DAVIDSONIAN reported
last week, in a series of articles on
academic freedom of expression.

The policy covering the visits of
controversial speakers to the state’s
campuses will be formulated once
again by the trustees and educators
and not by politically-minded law-
makers.

Although such policy was adopted
under pressure on many campuses
this week, the responsibility of these
educators was reaffirmed by the
amending of the law.

Most of all, the action was an ex-
ression of well-deserved confidence
in the maturity and sense of respon-
sibility in the majority of today’s col-
lege students.

The Hazards Of Romance

If Patrick J. Nugent isn’t sorry he
ever even heard of Luci Baines John-
son, then he must really be in love
with her.

He is the 22-year-old Marquette
University graduate who was all but
married by the press to the Presi-
dent's younger daughter one week-
end.

All the papers said he and Luci
went down to the LBJ ranch to get
the matrimonial go-ahead from the
Chief Executive. Friends say 18-year-
old Luci “cares deeply” for Nugent,
and wants to marry him. Nugent
hasn’t said anything except “my pri-
vate life is my own, and so is Luci’s.”

Bravo for Nugent. His private life

certainly is his own and we’re just
as tired of reading about it as he is
having it published.

Mostly, we feel sorry for him. If
reports of the romance are accurate,
we think he was doing LBJ a bi
favor by offering to take Luci of
his hands before she becomes an
old maid of 19.

Big Daddy Johnson apparently said,
“Wait a while.” It is most convenient
that Nugent will not have to waste
that time while he waits. He’s be-
ing called into military service next
month.

Amazing coincidence.

Dear Editor:

As a former member of the
Honor Court I was annoyed by
Mr. Trotter's diatribe of Nov-
ember 5 against the Court de-
spite the fact that he meant “no
slur on any Honor Court mem-
ber past or present.”

His reminiscences of Court
atroc'ties appear to have been
snatcned from floating rumors,
cultivated with a vivid imagina-
tion, and based in a few cases,
on a minuscule of fact.

The fact, however, taken out
of context is distorted. In the
irresponsible piece of penman-
ship by Mr. Trotter, it appears
that the only thing he advocates
is criticism — destructive not
constructive, at that.

Contrary to Mr. Trotter’s as-
sertion that the main purpose
of the Honor Court is “to pro-
ject the school's bloated and
fraudulent public relations im-
age” the objective of the Court
is to set the standard of student
conduct and to create and main-
tain an atmosphere of honesty.
(Mr. Trotter seems to be search-
ing for a cause: perhaps, he
might consider this one.)

The Court is not a faculty ex-
tension and it operates, except
in the case of an appeal, without
faculty intervention. It is.a coun-
cil of students elected by their
peers to promote an awareness
of the honor system.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Former Court Chairman Disputes Trotter

Unfortunately, it falls the lot
of the Court to hear and try
cases of suspected violations of
the system. In this instance
there is an empathy between the
student-Court and student-de-
fendent, and a sense of humility
not ‘‘megalomania”’ is perva-
sive.

The “dirty atmosphere’ men-
tioned by Mr. Trotter is not
generated by the Court, but in
the fact that it is the Court's
responsibility to deal with some
irresponsible persons.

One remembers that only a
few years ago that he found
himself fruitfully aligned with a
positive cause bigger than him-
self. One remembers long meet-
ings where improvements were
suggested and incorporated and
concepts heatedly thrased out,
There was no time “to create
offenders in a dull season.”

Dear Editor:

For various reasons I have
been delayed in giving a care-
ful reading to the issue of THE

ever, that it is not too late for
me to comment on the Report

Salutatory Greetings

In the first place I would ex-
press appreciation for your ac-
tion in thus interpreting the work
of the Trustees to your readers.
There is a continued need for
the Trustees and the Students
of Davidson to know and under-
stand one another better. I am
grateful for the accuracy with
which Mr. Lesesne reported the
substance of my interview with
him in this connection.

There is one point, however, at
which I would like to clarify the
statements made concerning the
Trustees. In two different ar-
ticles on that page reference is
made to the Trustees as the
“Legal Owners” of Davidson.
While this phrase is technically
correct, and while it is partially
explained in the articles, it may
also carry implications which
should not remain unchallenged.

A. trustee, as defined by the -

Oxford Universal Dictionary is
‘tone to whom property is en-
trusted for the benefit of an-
other; often loosely, one of a
number of persons appointed to
manage the affairs of an institu-
tion.” Management as a trust is
the real function of these men.

Committee Head Clarities
Football Scheduling Policy

Dear Editor:

There are certain aspects of
Mr. Arch McCallum’s article on
“football scheduling’ in THE
DAVIDSONIAN, Friday. Novem-
ber 12, 1965, which need to be
clarified before all sorts of ru-
mors get started.

According to the decision of
the Davidson College Trustees
at their Spring meeting. 1965, all
intercollegiate athletic schedules
must be approved by the Facul-
ty Athletic Committee. The Com-
mittee membership includes The
President, Dr. Martin, the Dir-
ector of Athletics, Dr. Tom
Scott, and five members of the
Faculty. The Director of Athle-
tics handles the actual schedul-
ing through his office.

The football schedule is a fre-
quent topic for discussion at the
meetings of the Faculty Athletic
Committee. In particular, the
type of opponent on the football
schedule is examined more clos-
ly than is the case in any other
sport at Davidson. Recommen-
dations for opponents are made
by the Head Football Coach, Mr.
Smith, but all seven members of
the Committee make suggestions
and comment at length on types
of desirable football opponents.

The Faculty Athletic Commit-
tee has agreed that Davidson
should be willing to play any
other member of the Southern
Conference, and should attempt
to schedule the strongest teams
in the Conference, including
West Virginia. Any other policy
would be an admission that
Davidson does not belong in the
Southern Conference. In addi-
tion, the Committee has also
agreed that non-conference foes
should be selected very careful-
ly, and should reflect the ‘‘col-
leges similar to Davidson’’ prin-
ciple. Obviously, the latter ap-
proach complicates Dr. Scott's
scheduling efforts and cannot al-
ways be observed. It is also ac-
curate to say that the Commit-
tee has shown a willingness to
consider a ‘big name” college
as an occasional opponent, but
at no time has the Committee
shown any interest in what the
general public would call a “big-
time” football schedule.

Incidentally, the negotiations
with Colgate University, which

are not yet complete for a game
in 1970, were initiated as the re-
sult of a suggestion from within
the Faculty Athletic Committee,
itself.

In my several years as Chair-
man of the Faculty Athletic
Committee, I have found the
members of the Committee to be
very realistic in their approach
to scheduling football opponents.
It is my personal opinion that
the Committee will continue to
affirm the football scheduling
principles mentioned above.

Dear Editor:

Not the least admirable qual-
ity of Davidson is, after all, that
of remaining insensible to logic;
holding out for considerable pe-
riods, ten years or more, as in
this controversy about ROTC,
after all arguments and shadow
of arguments have faded away
from it, till the very urchins on
the street titter at the argu-
ments it brings.

Logic—the ‘‘Art of Speech"—
does indeed speak so and so;
clear enough: Davidson still
shakes its head; will see wheth-
er something else ILLOGICAL,
not yet ‘‘spoken,"' not able to be

“spoken,’’ do not lie in the busi- *

ness, as there so often does!
It is so old, say you? Yes, and
the hotter haste ought you. of all
others, to be in to let it. grow
no older!

Dear Editor:

It.was with troubled souls that
all Davidson men here received
the news of the recent weaken-
ing of that rule which has work-
ed steadily and effectively to
help preserve Davidson's “‘best
small college in the South”
standing.

This was especially disheart-
ening in the light of our current
effort to convince the students
and faculty at Philipps-Universi-
tat of the evil and danger of per-
mitting the sale and consump-
tion of alcoholic beverages on
the campus and in the town of
Marburg.

The Trustees of Davidson hold
the property of the college only
as legally elected representa-

neither.a moral nor a legal right
to use that property for pur-
poses other than those which are
approved by the church. It is

rather their responsibility to de.
liberate and decide as to the
policies by which the great ends
for which the college was es.
tablished may best be attained,
and to choose the administrative
officers and faculty members
whom they believe best qualified
to execute those policies. Any
procedure other than this would
constitute a breach of the trust

These are principles which
need to be clearly understood by

_. TRIPPING AROUND THE PUNGI STICKS in
Vietnamese jungles appeals to very few students
here at Davidson. But unless the situation changes
drastically, a few of us may see those jungles fairly
soon —- a ‘prospect resulting in a few thoughts on
Viet Nam and the draft.

OUR PRESENT’. DRAFT SYSTEM bothers me. A
smart college student can plan his career so that
he is virtually exempt from the draft. The boy who
doesn’t go on: to school has much difficulty getting a
job, gets yanked out of jobs, and is nearly always
drafted. Meanwhile his college counterpart sits nice
and easy and avoids military service.

_ What: this:amounts to is class and economic
discrimination. And it’s pretty sickening to hear so
many college men brag about how they're going to
beat the draft. What would be far more equitable
would be to require two years of military service for
all men physically and mentally able: before they are
35, married or’unmarried, college students or gar-
bage collectors. —

This might be a chance for a few more college
men to demonstrate their patriotism and make Selec-
tive Service more equitable.

THIS’ VIET NAM DEAL shows once again how
middle-of-the-road policies get kicked by everybody.
Why should we keep trying to defend our presence
in Viet Nam on moral grounds? We are in there for
strategic reasons and these are justifications enough.
I hate to see people get hurt anywhere in the world,
but peace-at-any-cost is worthless. Yet let's avoid a
nuclear sttike on Hanoi and Peiking for humanitar-
ian reasons, if there is any other way to effectively
protect 300 years of attempts toward liberty, justice
and social cohesion.
