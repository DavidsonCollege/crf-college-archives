Children of the malt: |
taste-testing Mexican and Caribbean beers

By JOHN HUTCHINSON
_.. Born out of the fear that, in a
quest for quantities of beer,
most students disregard its
quality, this column is the first
of a series that will appear in
this semester’s Davidsonian.

Though my guest drinkers
and Iarenot beerconnoisseurs,
we can tell a good beer froma
bad one. “Children of the
Malt” will record the opinions
and evaluations of both myself

and my'several guest drinkers _

as we taste at least 100 beers
this semester in a series of 8-10
blind taste-testing sessions.
This week’s column is dedi-
cated to cold beer from warm
places: Mexico and the Carib-
bean. I extend thanks to Mike
Van Hecke, Desktop Design
Manager in the College Rela-
tions officeand Charles Houck,
Class of ‘89 and Domino’s

Pizza Guy, for serving as guest.

drinkers.

The results, which in many
cases were most surprising,
are recorded on the chart.

Significant comments:

Sol: Complimented by lime, a
good sipping beer witha sharp
aftertaste.

Chihuahua: Enjoys ‘success.

almost flat: “Distinct dishwater
characteristics” —-Van Hecke.

ing. Boring beer, bad with lime.
Reeks: “Beer should only smell
like this after the digestion
process” —Van Hecke.
Superior: Good, smooth taste,
solid Mexican beer. Works well
with lime.

Tecate: If you must drink it,

Corona: Not a heavy beer. A
good party beer, easy todrinka
lot of.’ Would compliment
cheese and crackers. Clean
taste. “A Mexican beer that
should appeal to women”
-Van Hecke.

Bohemia: Metallic, almost

irretrievably insane!’” -Houck.
“An example of just how bad a
beer can be” —Hutchinson.

Dos Equis: Very good flavor,
color. Heavy beer that would
go well with a meal like steak.
“Well-rounded, well made
beer” —Houck. “Less Mexican

flavor-I’d call it “Bavarian
Mexican’” —Van Hecke.
Simpatico: Flat. “Drinkable
but generic” -Van Hecke.
“There’s too much good beer to
waste you life drinking this”
-Hutchinson.

Caribe (Kingston, Jamaica):
Tastes like peas, honest. “I
won't give it an “F’ because it
tastes so interesting: not too
good, but I could drink this in
Aruba” —Houck. “Smells like
when Evelyn puts green beans
in the pressure cooker. Ill give
it an A/F for guts/flavor”
-Van Hecke.

Red Stripe (Trinidad, West In-
dies): Boring. A Budweiser
with some flavor. “Nonde-
script. It’s a crying shame to
pay $1.50: for it when you can
get Miller for 75 cents”—Van
Hecke.

Our favorites: Dos Equis, Su-
perior and Corona.

Least favorites: Bohemia, Te-
cate and Chihuahua.

Best for conversation: Caribe,
Bohemia.

Hopefully you didn't wear anything you
cared about at Self-selection

By VIRGINIA MISCHEN

“R-U-S-K! Husky Ruskie all the

way!” ;

Although the computerized. lists
were out at 6 a.m.,for most of the cam-
pus, this chant yelled,by the members
of Rusk House was the unofficial start of
Self-Selection,

Famed in Davidson social life as the
biggest party night of the year, Self-Se-
lection night arrives with its own
very—well, unique—experience.

The ladies of Wai er Hail celebrated the in

time to wear clothes one cared about. _

Whoever thought that being doused
with champagne, skidding on one’s
derriere across a very wet floor and
dancing withmembers of one’sownsex
could be so fun?

Self-Selectioneve found many upper- -

classmen smiling (or grimacing!) as
they remembered years past. It also
found many freshmen wondering ex-
actly what madness would befall them
the next night.

Freshman Katherine Casey thought

duction of their new members, According to one freshman, self-selection was nota

Self-Selection was going to be a “mas-
sive party.” She described her expecta-
tions for the experience by saying, “You
walk in and people throw champagne

all over you. And then the guys show

up, right?”

Lisa Jacobson felt, “It’s gonna be re-
ally neat to belong to the house—going
‘and partying with everyone you're
going to do stuff with.” When asked
whether she had been told anything of
the next evening’s festivities, she re-

plied, “I’ve been. warned not to wear
anything I care about.”

Andy Schwabe described his emo-
tional state as “excited and apprehen-
sive.” He anticipated Self-Selection
being a “wild, crazy night.”

As a sophomore undergoing Self-Se-
lection, Pichet. Thiansathaporn had
more knowledgeable words of wisdom
to impart. The three words he used to
sum up the following night were
“wild,” “crazy” and “drinking.”

He continued by making a dubious-
sounding claim: “I’m not going to look
stupid.”

On Sunday night, when the hang-
overs were (hopefully!) gone, when the
houses were clean, when the clothes
were washed, memories of Self-Selec-
tion, at least for some people, lingered
on.

An unofficial poll of some freshmen
revealed the general consensus for the
evening to be “fun,” although Lisa
Jacobson ruefully exclaimed, “I didn’t
think it would be so cold!”

And so now, Self-Selection “90 is but
another page in Patterson Court his-
tory.

However, by way ofa post-script, the
author of this article would like to add
that she does recall seeing Pichet that
momentous night.

And, unlike many of us, he didn’t
look stupid.
