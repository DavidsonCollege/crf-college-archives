taet his reply came
less than twentyrfour

our stand, which was
no surprise. However,
many have asked us
what the sports’ editor

of the News had to say in reply, so we are printing excerpts

from his letter.

Dear Gordon:

March 3, 1950

Happy to have your letter and have the opportunity to
give you my answer on the why of a positionless all-state team.
First, soon as the coaches return to the type of game in
which position is more definitely clarified, then we shall do

the same on our all-state. For

instanee, at Carolina, Nearman

often switches from center to guard, so does Patterson and
sundry other versatile operators. At State. Dickey is often
used as a guard. Cartier is a man of all positions. The cases ot
men employed solely in one position in basketball are isolated.
The guard who can shoot is now taking as many shots at the

bucket as the center or forward,

Groat, of course, has no place on an all-state team. He es

as in the case of Groat at Duke.

hus been out of school over three weeks. How ean a man. not
in school and not the recipient of a letter (block letter) rank
as all-state? As for Cobb, I admire the yonng man greatly,
lave the ntmcst respect for him as an athlete and a gentleman.

White Cobb on the News all-state. It’s no reflection on him,
however, for T think he was bucking probably as fine a talent as

we ever had in the state..
Just to keep us straight:

I love Davidson like I Jove my

own hometown, both full of dear hearts and gentle people.

Sincerely,

So now you have both sides of the picture. It’s
belief, however, that Bisher failed to present any very con-

elusive arguments as opposed to those which were given to him.

Compare the two letters if you

have an old Davidsonian handy,

and draw your own conclusions. Frankly, we are more con-
vinced than ever that we are right because of the weak points in
his argument. Read carefully his letter and see if you won't
be able to punch holes in everything he said on the subject.
