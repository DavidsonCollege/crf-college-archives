Michael John Walker Discourses
On His Start In Art Of

Sculpturing
(By Evuenip Fant)

“Mr. Walker, how did you get your
start in the wood-carving racket?” the
reporter asked, stepping among the
shavings on’ the floor to his bed. _

“It was about five years ago, when I
made a little head, while just whittling.
I got interested, for no reason at all,
and began making little pieces, which I
pasted together to make groups. While
a senior in high school I specialized in
know, wooden ones—for
which I received no great acclaim.” (It
had been the reporters original plan to
ask leading and organized questions, to
direct the interview into right channels,
but he soon found that this would
quite impossible, and said no more.)

“I only got a small set of chisels, re-
lying on my ability, rather than on my
tools, for the production of artistic work.
Formerly I] made all my carvings from
pictures, but | have recently found that
the construction of a small clay model
is quite whelpful.

I chose my subjects
during my formative years from the old
(here he crossed, himself), but
now they come only from my head. The
Library, my far-seeing patron, displays
these works to the public eye.

“Despite the fact that I have produced
some sixty pieces, I have received none
of the recognition due me. My outlook
toward the artistic appreciation of this
generation is fast becoming bitterly cyn-
ical. :

“During the summers, which I spend
in the more artistic atmosphere of Mon-
treat, I find myself more fully appre-
ciated, especially by the middle-aged
feminine element of the town, and also
hy the less attractive girls. I seem able

were. Here, a pretty blush.)

“T should find it impossible to create
beauty were it not for the omni-pres-
ence of an attentive muse, to whom I
must attribute all. His the hand

and flighty discourse ‘on the merits of
the artistic muse, which consideration for
the reader forces the reporter to omit.)

“My studio is behind Mr. Torrence’s
shop. True, it is humble, but Michelan-
gelo.. (Another discourse, likewise
omitted.) “What's more, I'm on my way
to a garret studio, as this room on the
fourth floor of Watts will testify. The
use of the workshop is an, indication
that Davidson is at last awakening to
the presence of the great mind in her
midst. :

“This summer I plan to continue work
on a group I will call the Valkyrie, short-
ly to be commenced. This work is in-
spired by Wagner’s opera “Die Wal-
kure.” I shall set aside a time’ froin my

Even with my cynical outlook, 1 can be
a gay dog at times.

“Perhaps, of the general
tenor of this interview, | may be accused
by shallow-thinking persons of being a
consummate egotist. (“My gosh!” the
reporter thought; “he read my
mind!"). Some may call me an overbear-
ing braggart. But hide much
behind the cloak of an artist—and I am
an artist.”

Turning to his roommate, your scribe
asked, awestruck, “How does it feel to
room with a genius?” Opening one eye,
and stifling a yawn, he slowly replied,
“T've often wondered.”
