Wildcat Volleyball 12-8
After Win Over Bulldogs

By Bruce Balestier

The Davidson volleyball re-
turned to Belk Arena Thursday
after a month on the road, and
fought off UNC-Asheville in a 2
hour and 25 minute epic, 5-15, 15-
5, 15-8, 10-15, 15-11. The win
gave the Wildcats a 3-1 record in

‘Big South play, and pushed their

overall record to 12-8.

The ‘Cats got off to a sluggish
start in game 1, and seemed over-
whelmed by the Bulldogs’ mon-
strous front line, led by 6’2" Ilona
Fekete, the Big South Player of the
Year and the national leader in
blocks a year ago. In game 2, the
hitting of Mimi Plauche and Janet
Delery led Davidson on an 8-point
tear that turned a 7-5 lead intoa 15-
5 win. Holt Hathaway closed out
the game with a service ace.

The Wildcats took advantage

of several net violations by Fekete
and did some impressive blocking
of their own to capture game 3..A
big block by Katherine Anderson
and Jennie Wagner gave the ‘Cats
an 8-4 lead and provoked a Bull-
dog timeout, and Davidson coasted
to the win.

Davidson turned suddenly er-
ror-prone in losing game 4, dem-
onstrating an unsettling habit of
missing serves at crucial times.
But they stormed out of the gate in
the final game, jumping to a 12-2
lead and settling for a 15-11win.
The hitting of Plauche sparked the
crowd to frequent renditions of the
Mimi Mash, a close relative of the
Tomahawk Chop.

The win over the Bulldogs
came on the heels of two Big South
wins and a non-conference loss to
UNC-Greensboro in the preceding

Rips Up W&L Tourney

By Robert Grubb
The members of the mens’
tennis team may have been the
happiest students returning from
fall break. Davidson dominated the
Washington and Lee Invitational

“1 Tournament over the break, win-

ning every flight. “Without adoubt
it was the strongest performance
we have ever turned in,” said Coach
Jeff Frank.

Davidson competed against
Washington and Lee and Emory,
both top ten Division III schools
and VMI, a Southern Conference
team. The event consisted of four
singles and two doubles flights.
Albie Varoski-won the top flight,
losing only seven games in his
three matches. In the same flight,
Russell Briggs lost to Emory’s
number one player, Colin White.

In the second flight, two
Davidson freshmen, Holt Vaughan

| and Daniel Grinnan, advanced to

the final, which was not played

| out. The results were the same in

the other two singles flights. John
Beyer and Dave Tonidandel met in
the third flightand John Beyer and

Chris Parker were the finalists in
the fourth flight.

Beyer teamed up with Vaughan
to win the doubles, winning two
three set matches along the way.
The second doubles flight also
featured an all-Davidson final, with
Varoski and Parker advancing to
meet Ryan Harper and Grinnan.
Harper and Grinnan won a third set
tie-breaker to get to the final.

_ The Wildcatsaccomplished all
of this without number-two player
David Jespersen. Jespersen
sprained his ankle in the Wofford
tournament Sept 28. Frank was
ecstatic over the play of the entire
team, but especially the two fresh-
men. “I never anticipated fresh-
men playing as well as they did
over the weekend,” said Frank.

Frank used the success in
Jespersen’s abscence. to empha-
size the team’s depth, which he
views as its greatest strength,
“Thereare so many people playing
well, that I am having a difficult

time picking one of four players °

who could start in the number six
position,” said Frank.

week. The Wildcats started things
off September 30 with a three-
game sweep of Winthrop.
Davidson travelled to UNC-G
October 2 to meet the Spartans,
and though the team fell in4 games,
their play improved as the match
progressed. The ‘Cats dropped the
opening game in the next night’s
game with new conference mem-
ber Liberty, but swept the next
three games to defeat the Flames.
For Coach Rebecca Hawkins,
the regular season is but a long
prelude to the Big South Tourna-
ment, and with a month to go until
it arrives, she is pleased with her
team’s play. “We have been play-
ing stronger every match and....
we are getting in good shape for
the rest of the season,” she said.

The ‘Cats warmed up for the
Washington and Lee tournament
with victories over UNC-Greens-
boro and Liberty. UNC-G fell 7-2,
which was an improvement over
last spring’s 5-4 match at Davidson.
Frank was concemed that Davidson
lost two doubles matches. Frank
has concentrated on doubles in the
past, because they have been a
weakness for the Wildcats.

Davidson won 9-0 at Liberty,
the newest member of the Big
South. Briggs filled in nicely for
Jespersen at number two, pulling
out the win in two close sets.
Varoski, who has been playing well
recently, won easily, 6-0, 6-0.

Frank is looking forward to -

this weekend’s tournament at
Davidson because of the way the
team has been playing. The ‘Cats
will host Coastal Carolina, Wil-
liam and Mary and UNCC, with
play beginning on Friday at 2
o’clock. All three teams have
played Davidson well in the past,
but Frank i$ confident. “I couldn’t
be happier with the way the team is

playing,” said Frank.

team’s strength.

Next was sophomore Amy
Bertram, who, though still recov-
ering from an earlier leg injury,
was once again a great asset to the
team. Behind her were runners Jean
DeMoss, Lisa Sitek and Carolyn
Meadows. Times were felt to be
irrelevant during this race as the
course was unique and spikes were
not recommended, due to long
stretches of concrete and alligator
pools.

For the injury-riddled
Davidson men’ steam, progress has
beenslow. Under threatening skies,
the men’s team began the race lath-
ered in sweat and revved up for a
good run. But it was not to be, as
the relieving rain never fell and the
Wildcats succumbed once again to
injuries.

At mile three, captain Ted
Richardson pulled out of the race,
due to the incessant pounding of
the cdncrete on his. still-injured
ankle. Richardson, though disap-
pointed, felt rightly that it would
be better to wait and recuperate a
bit longer before attempting the
high-speed runs for which he is
famous. At the end of his race,
junior Ian Stewart, finishing first
for Davidson, suffered a blow to
his foot. Though he did finish, he
has yet to recover from his injury.
Sophomore Kevin Wilson,aprom-
ising young upstart, also withdrew
from the race after taking a hard
fall when striking a foreign object
on the course. Freshman Erik
McMichael, a strong contender in
Davidson’s future, finished the race
under extreme pain from advanced
shin-splints. which hampered his
performance.

The Davidson Cross Country
team is now entering the final
stretch of their season. Though
hindered by injuries and seemingly
lackluster performances, the Wild-
Cats still have the potential to pro-
vide much excite:ent. The Wild-
cats will take on the state’s best
Saturday morning when Davidson
hosts the North Carolina Intercol-
legiate meet.
