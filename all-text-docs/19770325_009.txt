DIAL-A-Lumni aids fund raising

By DAVE KELLER
Executive Editor

With an expected total sum
of $30,000-$35,000 received in
pledges, the Dial-A-Lumni
campaign underway this week
and next is an obviously
successful way to enrich the
Living Endowment.

That amount, though,
shrinks in the face of ,the
prodigious sum of money Dav-
idson College must raise each
year.

Basically, the college has
five sources of. revenue: stu-
dent tuition and fees; govern-
mental appropriations,
grants, and contracts; income
from trusts and the Endow-
ment; income from auxiliary
enterprises; and gifts and
private grants.

By far the college’s largest
source of funds is student
tuition; following it in magni-

The combined income from

income follow successively in

Next, potential contributors
are reached by regional Dial-
alumni call alumni in one

sent four mailers during the
year, with pleas to give in-

cluded, and parents of stu-
dents are hit for gifts.
Finally, the college actively
seeks out friends and grad-
uates to join any of the
“giving societies’, the Alenda
($100), the Libertas ($500),
and the Ne Ultra ($1000).
According to Tom Bern-
hardt, director of the Living

Endowment, a typical alum-
nus who doesn’t give regularly
receives four letters-from~-the
college, a letter from his class
chairman, a letter from a class
agent, a call from a class
agent, and a call from either a
student, an alumnus, or both

generate. Miscellaneous sour-
ces also provide a substantial
degree of revenue.

The Living Endowment (or
Annual Fund), which falls in
the category ‘‘Gifts’’, hasa
manifest purpose in this
scheme: after the college’s est-
imated income and expendi-
tures are calculated, the Liv-
ing Endowment sets out to
generate the amount needed to
make up the difference. (The
Wildcat Club money does the
same job in the athletic de-
partment.)

Alumni and friends of the
college are asked to donate by
several means. The first of
these is the class chairman-
class agent system, in which a
designated member of each
graduated class contacts his
classmates and pushes for
contributions. Those who have
not responded by April are

‘*A lot of those small pro-
jects are important for on-go-
ing programs,” he said. ‘‘The
second thing is that it. would
take an awful lot of those
kinds of grants to finance a
major project.’’

Besides large grants for
major projects, the college
raises money for the endow-
ment ‘which is a first priority
thing because it’s an undergir-
ding,’’ said Spencer.

“Annual support would be
top priority if we see that
falling,”’ said Dittman.

Through Project 150, Dav-
idson College’s major fund
raising drive, Spencer ance
Dittman hope to raise $35
million. The college would
receive $400,000 annually for
each $8 million in endowment.

Part of the campaign will
revolve around the fact that
Davidson is not a rich college.
By publicizing this the college
hopes to let people know the
school does need’ money.
