Panel discusses worldwide human rights situation

UN Human Rights Day brings senior deputy assistant secretary of state to Davidson

By MARIA DOUGLAS

Amnesty International and the
Dean Rusk Program sponsored a
panel discussion last Wednesday
night about human rights in honor
of United Nations Human Rights
Day.

Panel members were senior
deputy assistant secretary for the
State Department’s Bureau of
Human Rights and Humanitarian
Affairs Bill Farrand, UNCC pro-
fessor of religion Kathryn
Johnson, visiting professor of
international relations Gabriela
Tarazona-Sevillano, and UNCC
professor of psychology Ignatius
Toner.

Farrand began the 900 Room
discussion by explaining human
rights as defined in the United
Nations Declaration of Human
Rights signed 48 years ago on De-
cember 10 by member nations of
the U.N.

The declaration holds signees
responsible for human rights in
their respective countries. It states
that no person is to be tortured;
that people have the right to their
own property; that no one should
fear for his own safety or the
safety of his property; that and
each has aright to his own beliefs.

Farrand said the Human Rights
Bureau of the State Department
publishes an annual report on
human rights violations on 170
countries. Often, they are accused
of meddling in the internal affairs
of both friend and foe..:

“It’s a briar in the saddle of
diplomacy,’’ Farrand said. The
Bureau reminds violators that
they have agreed to the declara-
tion and encourages them to live
up to their agreement.

“*The U.S. governmentdoes not
set itself up as judge and jury,”’
Farrand said, but it is in favor of
democracy and due process of the
law.

Johnson gave a portrait of
human rights in Iran. ‘‘The Is-
lamic republic of Iran is an inter-

esting case,’’ she said. Members
of the Muslim religious school are
allowing their own community
members’ rights to be violated.
Johnson said that Iran is returning
to Islamic traditional penalties to
handle opponents. Flogging and
amputation have been reinstated
as acceptable punishments. For
example, forgery can earn an of-
fender 74 lashes, drinking 80
lashes and unmarried couples
kissing can expect 99 lashes.

Amnesty International ques-
tions how humane these punish-
ments are, as flogging can cause
severe injury and even death. In
1986, stoning was the punishment
for eight reported cases of adul-
tery.

Johnson said that the prisons
were also havens for violations,
especially against opponents of
the regime in power in Iran.
People can be picked up and held
without charges; they can be tor-
tured and may wait until it pleases
the court to try the offender. They
often have no counsel and no
opportunity to prepare a defense.

Johnson said that trials are
heard by young, inexperienced
judges, and sentences can’t be
appealed and are often carried out
immediately.

Johnson said the problems pre-
date the 1979 revolution in which
the Shah and his family, the
Pahlavi regime, were ousted but
worsened after the change in
government.

Many thousands have .been
subjected to inhumane treatement
because they are considered a
threat. Khomeni ‘‘sees Iran as a
sick society, and the only: way to
make it well is to return to Islam,”’
said Johnson.

Those who oppose the regime
oppose God’s plan for Iran, and
those people are dangerous and
must be defeated, according to
Khomeni’s plan.

“*As far as human rights go, it
looks pretty grim,’’ Johnson said.

“Islamic law is not likely to go
out. There is little chance for
change.”

The situation in Peru is just as
bad as in Iran, according to Tara-
zona-Sevillano. In 1984 50 -tor-

tured and mutilated bodies were:

found buried in the mountains of
the Ayacucho province in Peru.
Terrorists or military police are
thought to be responsible.

The Sendero Luminoso, the
Shining Path guerillas, is the ter-
rorist group in control of the area.
“‘The Shining Path guerillas are an
elusive, secret, brutal organiza-
tion, unlike anything in the West-
ern hemisphere,’’ Tarazona-Sev-
illano said. ‘‘They have no regard
for human life and use terrorism
as aregular tactic.”’

Eight years ago Peru came
under a democratic political sys-
tem after 12 years of a military
dictator. There were 482 terrorist
incidents in that first year of
democracy. Ayacuhco was the
stronghold of the Shining Path
guerillas, and military police
were sent in to “‘protect’’ the area.

As a result innocent people
were killed if they were thought to

Santa Kuykendall put on a good

' party last week, but as usual he w

be supporters of the guerillas, and
others were killed if they tried to
follow the government.

Crimes of the military like rape,
torture and aggravated homicide
were said to be acts of duty and the
soldiers were let off with light
sentences, if tried. ‘‘These cannot
be considered acts of duty,’’ Tara-
zona-Sevillano said, ‘“These are
crimes.”’

In 1987 an. Anti-Terrorist Act
was passed to try anyone accussed
of terrorist acts and human rights
violations. After eight years of
fighting, 12,000 lives have been
lost at the hands of the military
and the Shining Path guerillas.

In Northern Ireland, the Catho-
lic minority constantly struggles
for rights from the Protestant
majority. Their struggle is
“‘analagous to what blacks
went through in the 60’s,”’
according to Toner.

A difference is that blacks
didn’t use terrorist tactics like
the IRA (Irish Republic Army)
does. Other groups in Ireland
also engage in fighting for
their cause. A part of the Brit-
ish Army and pro-Protestant

groups, like the RUC, (Royal
Ulster Constatlery), counter the
IRA.

All of these groups, Toner said,
violate human rights. One figure
shows that the IRA is responible
for 100 killings a year, by bomb-
ings and other attacks. ‘‘I don’t
think things will change in the
next year or two,’’ Toner said.

Farrand suggested the way to
change situations for people in
these countries is to become con-
cerned and involved. ‘‘Come to
evenings like this and follow
whatever issue is closest to you.”’
He also said-that the way to get get
results is to write a letter to your
congressman.

“*Write,’’ Farrand said. ‘‘Don’t
be quiet; it matters.”’
