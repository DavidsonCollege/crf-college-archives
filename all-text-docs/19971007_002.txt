In this issue of the Davidsonian,
you will find the Student Counseling
Center’s “Depression Self-Screening
Test” and the announcement of a re-
lated Thursday evening program,
“Lend a Hand: Helping a Friend Who
is Down.”

These are part of a National De-
pression Awareness Day, an annual
event in planning by Dr. DeWitt
Crosby and our Student Health Advi-
sors group for quite some time.

In light of the recent death of Zac
Lacy by suicide, I felt a need to send
this message. It is our hope that our
Depression Awareness activities will
be understood as one important com-
ponent in our ongoing efforts to edu-
cate the community about mental

An open letter to the College

health issues, and to encourage ‘timely

use of professional clinical services

when those among us have need.
Additionally, I would note that the

news ofa suicide does place some within
our community at higher risk for the
next few weeks.

We encourage everyone to be in-
formed about depression, and to be at-
tentive to those around you.

If you are someone who is con-

templating suicide, particularly if you
feel emotionally isolated from others
and were impressed by the love ex-
pressed by so many for Zac and in the
wake of his death, we urge you to
reach out to someone and discuss your
circumstances.

Your friends, College faculty and
staff, our chaplains Rob. Spach and
Brenda Tapia, and, of course, the Coun-
seling Center staff are all persons who
will sincerely care about you and re-
spond to your feelings — now, while

you are still safe and can address the’

circumstances which can seem so over-
whelming. ;

The oft-heard phrase “Davidson
family” must have a special meaning
for us at this time.

LEND A HAND: HELPING A FRIEND WHO’S DOWN

Acouple weeks ago, Mary Perrin
Anderson wrote an article about so-
called sophomore slump. She defined
the sophomore slump as not getting
dates and a lack of security. As a
sophomore, she said that she felt fine
and was feeling no effects of Slump
whatsoever.

I’m glad Mary Perrin is feeling
fine. I wouldn’t want her to feel any
other way, but she misunderstood the
sophomore slump and made a state-
ment about an entire year before it had
really began.

Isuffered from sophomore slump.
Before it happened to me, I thought
the slump was losing the energy of
freshman year and having grades go
down from boredom.

Instead, my life fell apart. Sopho-
more slump is a loss of direction; a
feeling of being caught in the middle.

In my case, depression followed.
Nothing felt right anymore.

‘I no longer felt welcome in
church, which was very disturbing for
me since I grew up init and it had been
a great source of strength for me. Ino
longer felt like I belonged at home and
I didn’t feel like I belonged at
Davidson. I didn’t want to be here, but
I didn’t want to be anywhere else.

I threw away a powerful relation-
ship with my girlfriend. I was tired all
the time. Fora stretch of two weeks, I
slept almost continually and would
wake in a delirium. I would have
mood swings and spells of mania when
I would have violent thoughts.

I thought of having a horrible
sickness and of dying as pleasant al-
ternatives to my life. My father called
often to make sure I was OK. My
mother cried with worry when we
talked. I was depressed.

Ifelt alone. I believed that every-
one else was having a good time while
I sat alone and depressed. I was not
alone. I later found out that many
others were sitting in their rooms feel-

ing the same way — depressed and very
alone.

Depression is not a rare experi-
ence. Depression is epidemic. In and
around sophomore year and often after
being abroad, many students become
depressed. It is not just a Davidson

&

phenomenaeither. Your friends at other
schools feel similarly. For many, it is
simply a hard time and a hard age.

Why. am I telling you this?. lam
writing this article as a warning and as
aconsolation. A warning to those who
have not been depressed, but may be
soon (although I hope you never are)
and a consolation to those who are now.

In relating my experience, I know
well that it is not unique. There are
many more people with experiences of
depression that are unfortunately far
worse than my own. For some, like Zac
Lacy, the emptiness and the pain was
more than they could bear.

If you are depressed, please, get
help. Use the Counseling Center. It
wasn’t until fall of my Junior year that
I used it. It was wonderful. I should
have gone over a year earlier, but I was
prideful and thought I could handle my
own problems.

Maybe I could, maybe I couldn't,
but we must use everything at our dis-
posal that can help. Just trying to ex-
press how I felt to athird party helped so
much. And heck, with your $25,000
membership fee, you get 10 sessions

_ free. Use them!

In the Davidsonian last week, both

Bobby Vagt and Leland Park talked’

about the Davidson community as a

family. I would like to join them. We |

Depression and the Davidson family

are afamily. And like a family, we are
not perfect,

We have our jerky older brothers
and our bratty little sisters. We are not
perfect. But, like a family, we are
loving. Members of a family support
each other in times of trouble and
sorrow.

I saw that this week after the
tragedy of Zac Lacy’s death. The love
and support shared from one person to
another among students, faculty, and
staff was a beautiful thing. All the
superficial divisions we build for our-
selves blew away and left loving and
concerned brothers and sisters helping
each other.

We shouldn’t need a tragedy to
have such love and support. It should
remain always. Davidson is not an
individual experience; it is a group
experience. We are in this race to-
gether, tied at the ankles, a 1601 legged
race, and we must help each other
along.

Those of you in pain of depres-
sion, seek help. Those of you who are
approached for help, bea friend. You
cannot usually cure depression, but
you can be supportive and give them
all the love you:can. No one should
grieve unnecessarily. I say these things
because you are members of my fam-
ily and I love you.

This week, there is an event that
all of you should attend. This Thurs-
day is Depression Screening Day. That
night at 7:30 in the Union, there will be

a meeting led by the Health Services |

Staff about depression.

It is not just for those. who are
depressed. It is also for those who
want to know how to be a friend to
those who are, Come to help yourself

and to learn about helping others. For |

more information about this meeting

or any other concerns, call the Coun- |.

Have a great and safe fall break.

Lerner brings musical

interests to Davidson

By Davip KANG
Staff Writer

Hailing from Lexington, Ky., Neil
Lerner is a musicologist who studies
everything from the music of Bach and
Handel to the opening title music of
Men In Black. His area of specialty and
research is film music, a relatively new
field that is gaining widespread inter-
est.

Lerner spent his un-
dergraduate years at
Transylvania University,
where he double majored
in music and English
while earning a minor in
history. He continued his
studies as a graduate stu-
dents at Duke University,
where he received an
A.M. and Ph.D. in musi-
cology. While at Duke,
Lerner taught several

.courses of his own de-

sign on film music.

“As an English major, I studied a
lot of film theory, criticism, and his-
tory,” Lerner said. “I also did a lot of
music. I sort of stumbled upon this way
of combining the two interests by study-
ing film music, the history of it, and
looking at how it works.”

Lerner just defended his doctoral

, dissertation in August. However, he is

already scheduled to read papers at three
national meetings this year. Next month,
Lerner will read a paper that deals with
Aaron Copland’s influence on film
music.

“His music is strongly identified
as characteristic of certain American
values,” Lerner said. “It’s musical work,
but it’s also cultural work. I try to hit it
from both sides. I don’t think you can
separate the musical part from the cul-
tural part.”

Although the importance of music
education is often undermined, Lerner’s
musical passion stands undisturbed. He
views music as a vital, integral part of
life.

“T think about this a lot myself,”

o Neil Lerner

Lerner said. “I got my Ph.D., and I’m
teaching music now, but I still have an
eye towards medical school and think
that would be a useful way to spend my
time. But just keeping people alive —
just sustaining life — that is awfully
important work, and I don’t take any-
thing away from that.

“But there has to be stuff out there
for people to live for, to enrich their
lives for, and to help them express them-
selves when they are
alive. And you have to
have music for all of that.
It’s just a constant part of
our lives now. The
thought of not studying
music and not dealing
with music in a serious,
critical way is tragic.”

While accompany-
ing the Chamber Sing-
ers, Lerner is teaching
two courses this term:
Introduction to Music and
Western Civilization and Introduction
to American Music. He plans to teach
a film music class next semester.

Lerner also éxpects to start work-
ing on a book soon. Right now he is
considering two subjects: government
documentary films and how music
works in them, and the tracing of
Copland’s sound through Hollywood.

Lerner has enjoyed his first few
months at Davidson.

The combination of teaching a field
he loves and having smart, motivated
students has been very appealing to
him.

“The students I’ve seen so far are
intellectually curious and seem to be
engaged by the material,” Lerner said.
“These are the reasons people get into
teaching, to see this kind of excitement. °

“The reason I am in musicology is
because I have found music that I feel
really passionate about. I’m doing this
because it’s fun. Once teaching and
dealing with this stuff isn’t fun, ’m not
going to do it anymore. That’s the
reward of my job, though — to try to get
other people excited about these things.”

Project Life pasta
dinner nets $1,200

By Liz NEIHEISEL
Staff Writer

The Project Life Bone: Marrow
Committee served nearly 450 dinners
in its Second Annual First Night Down
Pasta Dinner Sept. 19 on Patterson
Court.

The dinner was a fund-raising ef-
fort by the committee to begin facilitat-
ing funds for the bone marrow registry
to take place Nov. 18 and 19 in the
Union.

The pasta dinner was started last
year by committee chairwoman Kate
Stevens when Project Life found itself
in need of fast fundraising.

Last year, the dinner gave Halls
had a an opportunity to eat together in
one of their final hall activities of the
year.

This year, with more planning and
publicity, the turnout was tremendous.

With strong support from both the
freshmen class as well as upperclass-
men, most notably seniors, Project Life
totaled a net profit of $1,200 through
the Pasta Dinner.

“I feel like it was an enormous
success,” Stevens said.

Warner Hall and Sigma Alpha
Epsilon both provided additional sup-
port to the dinner. .

Alan Hyder and Bennett Thomp-
son, juniors and members of SAE, and
Craig Thompson provided musical ac-
comganiment for the dinner.

Project Life began on Davidson’s
campus eight years ago.

It was founded by David Lindsey,
who before his freshmen year was diag-
nosed with leukemia.

After undergoing cancer treatment
and receiving bone marrow from his
sister, Lindsey recognized the need for
donors.

He began a movement on campus
to register all Davidson students.

With the help of former service
director Katherine Turner, the Project
Life Bone Marrow Committee was
formed.

Since the formation of the com-
mittee and asa direct result of Lindsey's
efforts, over 2,000 people have been
added to the National Donor Registry,
with seven donating bone marrow to
needy recipients. :

The cost to type on campus each
year, subsidized through the Red Cross,
is $12,000-$15,000.

Upcoming Project Life events in-
clude T-shirt sales as well as an ice
cream social incorporating stories of
those whose lives have been touched by
leukemia and Davidson’s program.
