For Youth

And Adults of Unity Church

Unity Has Developed From
Chapel to Active Self-
Supporting Church

BILL MACY IS STUDENT
PASTOR FOR THIS YEAR
Church Offers Broad Reli-

gious Program Through

the Week

Down Depot Street beyond the
post office and the asbestos mill is
Davidson Unity Church. This
church was begun in the dim past
as a chapel, under the leadership
of some Davidson students, Through
the years the buildings have been
improved-and-added-to,-until-now
Unity Church is a self-supporting,
warm, and friendly church, with
Sunday School attendance between
ninety and a hundred, and having
active young people’s groups. Be-
side the church is a fine log cabin,
built about 1935 as the John How-
ard Men’s Bible .Class Cabin; it
serves handsomely ‘as well for the
ladies when they are hostesses for
a delicious*church supper, or for
young people’s activities. _)

At present, the weekly schedule
of the church includes Sunday
school and morning worship each
Sunday, Young People’s meetings
at 6:30 Sunday evening, a good old-
fashioned hymn sing at 7:30 after
Young People’s meetings, and cot-
tage prayer meetings each Wednes-
(day, night in the homes of.,the dif-
ferent members. A club for the
girls has been organized under the
leadership of Miss Harriett Brown
and Mrs. W. H. Macy, while Curtis
Harper and Bill Iverson have form-
ed a Boys’ Club, both groups being
conducted according to the prin-
ciples and standards exemplified by
the “Hi Y” clubs. Each Wednes-
day night in the Church Cabin, a
group of the young people meet to

discuss youth problems, under the
leadership of Virgil Pino; speakers
are chosen each week to lead the

Intercollegiate
Council Meets

Discussion Will Center Around
Economics and the Moral
Law

The Intercollegiate Council for
Religion in-Life-of-the Charlotte
Area will meet at Johnson C. Smith
University next Saturday after-
noon, March 22, at 3 p. m.

Due to transportation difficulties,
the members of the Council from
Smith—were—unable—to—attend the
meeting on the Davidson College
campus planned for March 1, The
same program will be presented
Saturday that was planned for the
past meeting. This will give the
members taking part more time to
organize the discussion.

Economic Order

Topic for the discussion by the
group will be the statement on the
economic order and its relationship
to the moral law issued last fall.
This statement is a joint work of
the members of the Synagogue
Council of America, the National
Catholic Welfare Conference, and
the Federal Council of Churches of
Christ in America.

Bight—sections cover the whole
field of economics. Students from
Johnson C. Smith will present the
first four parts followed by  stu-
dents of Davidson College present-
ing the later four parts. John
Pritchard and Miles Wood will rep-
resent Davidson on the program.
Following the formal presentation
there will be a period for discus-
sions.

Students. Invited

The Duke Dormitory lounge will
be the scene of the gathering next
Saturday on the Johnson C. Smith
University campus. All interested
Davidson students have been in-

vited to attend.

Lift Up
Your Eyes

Dr. Cunningham

Zona Gale once wrote toward the
end of a very productive career:
“T am determined
increase the areas of my aware-
ness.” That was a statement of a
purpose which every educated per-
son—ought--to—entertain.._In_ these
fateful, tragic, and yet wonderful
years, a person of shortsightedness
and narrow interests is not a good
citizen of his own community or
nation, much less of “one world.”

One of the constant temptations
to us in our quiet campus and vil-
lage life is that we allow ourselves,
being thus cloistered, to become
careless and unaware. Not seeing
the daily pressures which bear in
on countless communities and na-
tions of the world, we become un-
mindful, and then unconcerned. Of
course, we do read about them and
hear outside speakers refer to them,
and, in_ general, know, that those
conditions prevail. Even so, it is
easy to shrug our shoulders and say
“What can I do about it?”

That there is confusion, discrimi-
nation, injustice, prejudice, poverty,
hunger, and all varieties of human
suffering, may leave us cold and
untouched. Even if other people
did not need us, we could. not.af-
ford for our own sakes ‘to assume
that attitude. There is always for
us “a deadly peril of losing the
genius of the tender heart.” The
conception of “one world” with all
its frightful implications; is both
hopeful and alarming. And yet it
is as foreign to many educated
Americans as the news from Mars.
Meanwhile the nation which stands
to gain or lose most is America

herself.

During the war a letter came
back to me from the front. It is
written by one of Davidson’s best
known and most admired younger
alumni. He had made an excep-
tionally good record in military
service. Previously, he had been
a student body president, Phi Beta
Kappa, O. D, K. at Davidson.

henceforth—to

From that distant point of view
he was thinking devotedly of his
Alma Mater. His concern was at
the point of our too little interest
in community, national and world
affairs. While heartily apprecia-
tive of all Davidson has meant to
him, he was anxious about her

practical isolationism and the slight

interest of her students in the

broader problems of life.

In a significant book “Education
and World Tragedy” Dr. Howard
Mumford Jones states: ‘“Educa-
tion must somehow take account of
events in a world in which Soviet
Russia has become a dominant
power, Asia is violently disturbed,
and man’s uneasiness about his tra-
ditional values ‘is spread from a
few troubled spirits at the top of
the social pyramid down among the
mass of mankind everywhere. Mere-
ly to reaffirm past values by a re-
turn upon dead sages will not quite
do. What we need is an_educa-
tional program that will face the
present with courage and interest.”

The obligation resting upon us
all to be intelligent is a Christian
obligation. But beyond knowledge
there must be a will to work. The
staggering problems which face us
in the decades which lie immedi-
ately ahead will not be solved by
men of education alone. The dan-
gers particularly of technology
apart from-human interest and sym-
pathy, are painfully real. The fu-
ture is in the hands of good men
—men of Christian faith and char-
acter—who at the same time are
in- possession of sufficient knowl-
edge to guide toward a wise solu-
tion of our manifold problems.

Such character and knowledge
will demand that we look first about
us and see life with wide-open eyes;
that we shall look to the future and
understand its beckoning call, and,
finally, that we shall look up to
behold Him who is “the way, the
truth, and the life,” and shall take
courage and hope and expect clear
guidance.

Cub Pack For
Colored Boys
To Be Formed

‘Scouting Work in Community

Advances With Student
Aid

By Lee Willingham

Since the beginning of school
last September, several of the fel-
lows haye been performing very
faithfully the task of leading the
boys of this area in Scouting activi-
ties.*

Cornelius Troop
In Cornelius, Mae Hart, Doug
Hix, and Walter . Hopkins have
headed the troop there and have
done a splendid job, serving as as-
sistant scoutmasters. Because of
their age, none of the three is quali-
fied to serve as scoutmaster, a posi-
tion which has been unfilled all
year. If any member of the stu-
dent body over 21 is interested in
serving as. scoutmaster of this
troop, he is requested to contact
Murphy Williams, Y. M. C. A. see-

retary, as soon as possible.

Davidson Cubs

There are a number, of boys of
pre-scouting age in Davidson who
have been enjoying the benefits of
the Cub Scout movement under the
leadership of Bob Patten, Billy
Ford, and Frank Hooper. Profes-
sor and Mrs. William Cumming are
serving as adult leaders of these
younger boys.

Colored Troop

In the Negro community, Don
Coffey has served ‘as assistant
scoutmaster of the troop there in
conjunction with Professor Poe, the
scoutmaster. This troop under its
very capable leadership is filling a
real need among the boys.

New Cub Pack

The present project being under-
taken by this department is the
establishment of a Cub Scout Pack
for some 15 or 20 boys between the
ages of nine and 11 who reside in
the Negro community. The scout-
ing department of the Y will ap-
preciate any assistance which mem-
bers of the student body can give.

Methodists
Meet In April

Student Movement Meets On
First And Third Sundays

For the first time in the history
of Davidson the Methodists on the
campus have organized a student
group. The organization of this
Methodist Student Movement took
place early in the’ semester under
the leadership of Rev. Henry
Koestline, pastor of the Davidson
Methodist Church, and an ardent
youth worker. With approximately
one hundred and fifty students on
the campus belonging to the Metho-
dist Church, the group has fine pos-
sibilities for an attractive program
of fellowship, worship, and service.

At an early meeting officers were
elected as follows: President, Orin
Hutchinson; Vice-President, Bob
Richardson; Secretary, Joe Frazer;
Treasurer, Jim Pierce; and Pub-
licity Chairman, Grady Spires.

Twice Monthly

The Methodist Student Movement
now. meets regularly on the first
and third Sunday nights of each
month at 8:30 in the Methodist
“Hut”. The entertainment consists
of singing, games of various types,
discussions, and occasional motion
pictures of intrest.

Last month four delegates from
the Davidson Student Movement
attended a statewide rally in Greens-
boro. Owing to the ideas received
at this convention the Methodist
group has made plans for a con-
tinuous: program this Spring. On
the Sunday afternoon, April 2’0, a
special meeting will be held at the
Myres Park Methodist Church from
4:30 to 6:30. Present will be local
and Queens College girls. All are
invited to attend the March 30
meeting in the Methodist “Hut”
where plans for the coming months

will be laid.

and inspiration

Zesides

ference will stress such thoughts as
“Christian Heritage and Growth of
Persons” and “World Relatedness
and Social Responsibility”,

Opens April 25

Herb Meza, treasurer of the con-
ference and member of the state-
wide planning committee, stated
that there Would necessarily be a
delegation quota for Davidson due
to the size of the student body.
The meeting is to begin Friday eve-
ning, April 25, and continue through
the noon meal Sunday. Nawakawa
is a camp owned by the Greensboro
YWCA—aii ideal off-campus locat-
ion for the conference.

It is hoped there may be an en-
thusiastic response to this oppor-
tunity being offered. For more de-
tailed information come by the “Y”.

Y. M. C. A. BUDGET

The YMCA Board of Control
forms the budget for the activi-
ties of the school year. This. is
adhered to by the YMCA Cab-
inent in its work.

There are two diiferent sect-
ions to the budget. One covers
benevolent .activities both in the
United States and in. foreign
countries. The money for these
disbursements comes from the
Vesper Fund. Students contrib-
ute to this fund every Sunday
evening.

The other part of the budget
covers operating expenses, such
as office supplies, the YMCA
car, etc. The money for this
comes from the YMCA share of
the Student Activities Fee, col-
lected from every student at.the
beginning of the school year.

Purpose of Services
The

purpose of our Spring and

Services is fourfold. They are

body a renewed interest in religious

matters, a more adequate philoso
phy of life, a deeper commitment
to the “Christian faith, and quest
ins in our minds about religion.

It seems that our series of, services
just past has done a prett® fair job

of achieving its purpose.

that discourage us in questioning

thoroughly and facettthe “questions

that naturally arise.

Question Marks

It is quite a good thifte'to put a

when we do, we torce ourselves to
talk about them, read about. them,
and come to some decision about
them. We must recognise that there

the matter there is no telling which
is the thing that is understandable
and the thing that must be accepted

on faith,

We need to come ‘to the reali
zation that the things of religion
are a part of our lives, and they
necd to be discussed just as we
talk about sports and girls and
moncy. Too often we have relegat-
ed religious matters to the realm

of the undiscussed, and we need to
come to the point where we can
talk about them just as.freely and

comfortably as we do the other
things of life.
Dr. Chappell
Dr. Chappell is a great fellow.

He surely did keep us on the edge
of our seats with his stories. Those
of you who did not get to meet him
personally missed the chance of a
lifetime, because he is much_ the
same out of the pulpit as he is while
preaching. He has an inexhaustible
store of stories. His photographic
mind always manages to pull out
the proper story for the occasion.

It’s A Joke, Son

One of the better of these was
one he told at-a meeting of the
faculty. It was about a man who
went into the office of a veterinar-
ian with a Beston Bull Terrier and
asked that the stubby tail of the
pup be cut off right even with the

skin. The vet complained that the

until |

pup only had’ an inch-and-one-halt

of tail and asked why he should be

deprived of the privilege of wage-

ing his tail’ No answer was forth

coming, but when the vet threaten

ed to refuse, the inan gave this ex

planation: “Well, my mother-in-law

is Coming to Visit us next week,

and | don’t want one single bit of

welcome when she contes in the

door,”

You noticed that Dr. Chappell al-

Ways quoted iis Scripture, even

when it was a long passage. During
the course of the Week he explained
that he got into the habit of doing
this as a young man, when he rea-

that and
studying a passage he could quote
it us readily as he could read ity At
this point he says that he is never

Results

One thing that should result from
our series of Spring Services is a
flow of new blood into the religious
organizations of our campus. ‘here
are a number of them that are per-

torming a very valuable function

rhere is the Westminster lellow-
ship that meets each Sunday night
at 6:30 in the Quadrangler Koons

in Chambers. It is in the midst of

series of discussions about the
different denominations ot Christ-
lanity.

There is the Student Sunday

School Class that meets in the same
room at 10:15 on Sunday mornings.
Coach Story is the teacher for this
class, and he is doing a great job
There is the regular Wednesday

effect in
deepening the religious life of our
whole campus.

There is the Davidson Christian
Fellowship that meets each Tues-
day night in Phi Hall. This group
is directed by students and is for
students to meet and think togethet
about spiritual matters.

All.of these different groups are
doing a fine job, and it will be well
worth while to get into one or more
of them and grow up in our Christ-
ianity.
