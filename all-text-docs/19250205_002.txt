found the goal for several ‘points and ob-
tained a substantial lead. The first half
ended with Carolina sitting on the heavy end
of a 2 3to 5 score. The second half opened
up with a spurt by the Wildcats, but this was
soon stopped and Carolina began. In all, 21
points were’rung up before Davidson was on
its feet again. This was too great a lead to
overcome and the game ended 44 to 13.

Captain Sook Boggs played his usual con-
sistent and heady game for the Wildcats.
Many more Carolina goals would have been
shot had it not been for the valiant work of
this scrappy Wildcat. Anderson was high
point man for the Davidson team and he
also played steady and well. Sam McDon-
ald led in scoring for Carolina. He was
ably assisted by Purser and Dodden, The
Wildcats fought hard but were unable to
compete with the flashy work and accurate
shooting of the Carolina men.

ALL SET FOR 1925!

| Dr. J. M. Douglas, graduate man-
ager, and Kelsey H. Regen, student
manager of football, today announced
the football schedule for 1925 almost

completed. In fact, all except the
place for the Presbyterian College
game.

Four games have been scheduled for
Davidson, the Wildcats meeting Elon,
Guilford, Hampden-Sidney and Duke
University on Richardson Field.

The announcing of the placing of
the Furman University game in Char-
lotte is perhaps the biggest change,
while the changing of the State game
to Pinehurst instead of in Davidson
as for some time was thought is also
new. Wofford will be met in Rock
Hill, while the North Carolina game
goes back to Chapel Hill on the same
campus basis.

The schedule follows:
Sept. 19—Elon at Davidson.
Sept. 25—Wofford at Rock Hill.

Oct. 3—Wake Forest at Charlotte.
Oct. 10—Guilford at Davidson,

Oct. 17—Presbyterian at pending.
Oct. 24—Furman Univ. at Charlotte.
Oct. 31—N. C, State at Pinchurst.

Nov. 7—Hampden-Sidney at Davidson.

Noy. 14—North Carolina at Chapel
Hill.

Noy. 28—Duke Univ. at Davidson.

In Pre-Exam Clash

The Davidson Wildcats trounced the Elon
team 46'to 19 on the local floor January 20th
in a rather slow game. The Davidson team
took the lead early in the game and had lit-
tle trouble in maintaining this advantage
with the airtight defense that forced the
Christians to resort to long shooting. At
this Newman@ooked good but the Elon squad
Was never able to stop the fast passing of
the Wildcats.

With Davidson leading by only three

points Hewlett was sent in and immediately
the team took on life, shooting to at 21 to

saw the Wildcats spurt ahead with 14
straight points. Laird, after playing medi-
ocre ball throughout the season, came back
strong with a fast game.

DR. OREN MOORE TALKS

(Continued from page 1)
Moore, “we have probably established the
fact that the world is in great need of serv-
ice of the Christlike type.” He continued
by telling of some of the men who had gone
out from Davidson to render Christlike serv-
ice in a world of need.

He brought his message down to each in-
dividual by saying, “Service can come from
you because you come from Christian com-
munities. You are getting a Christian edu-
cation, and your instincts are right because
your training was right.”

He closed with a striking allegory which
_told that service for humanity is the best
| thing in the world. “Greater love hath no

man than this, that a man lay down his life
| Sar his friends.” :

| The-music was*ted by Roland Parker.
| Special music was given by Viernes and Mc-
Cravey, with Purdy playing the accompani-
ment. The scripture was read by Moffett
and Don Stewart and Rice led in prayer.
