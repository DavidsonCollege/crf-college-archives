both opponents, but
eventually suc-
cumbed 183-117 to the Dukes and 184.5-
113.5 to the Tribe of William & Mary.

Despite the overall losses, both squads put
on dominant displays of swimming in many
individual events.

“We definitely were at a disadvantage at
JMU’s pool, but we had several people swim
very well in spite of that,” said Merritt Peele
09.

In the women’s 1000 freestyle, Alanna
Ream ’09 and Ellie Trefzger ’07 took the top
two finishing spots. Ream touched the wall
first in 10:30.69, and Trefzger’s 10:35.80

swam really strong legs to help the men win
their relay.”

On the women’s side, captain Megan

Noreen, Hubbard break records at Caralina Invite

By JAMIE WILL
Staff Writer

This past weekend, the men’s and
women’s track and field teams traveled up
I-85 to UNC-Chapel Hill to compete in the
Carolina Invitational. In the third of four
indoor meets before the Southern
Conference Championships, the team put on
a strong showing.

Two school records were set by members
of the men’s team, which also recorded five
other performances that landed on the
Davidson top-10 performer list of all time.

On the men’s side, Douglas Noreen ’07
put on two spectacular performances. He set
a new school record in the mile at 4:17.09
finishing second in the meet.

He came back later to finish fourth overall
in the- 800-meter with a Davidson top-10
time of 1:57.11.

In other distance running events, two more
runners finished big for the Wildcats. Austin
Mercadante ’06 finished with a time of
8:54.39 in the 3000-meter, which is both a
personal best and a Davidson top-10.

Lance Harden ’09 continued his strong
running from last fall’s cross country season,
and he finished in fourth place in the 5000-
meter with a Davidson top-10 time of
15:25.55,

_ Coach Gary Andrew also noted that
Harden’s time was the fastest time for the
5000-meter all year.

In addition to the success of the long dis-
tance runners in the Carolina Invitational, the
sprinters and shot-putters were determined to
make their mark in the meet as well.

Ryan Hubbard ’08 contributed another
record in the 200-meter indoor dash, running
a time of 22.99. Hubbard also long jumped a
Davidson top-10, landing at 21’ 3 1/4”.

Davidson scored two shot-putters in the
meet’s overall top-10. Will Funderburg ’09

and Jim Walter ’07 finished ninth and 10th,
respectively, both finishing with personal
records. Funderburg’s throw of 13.34 meters
also made the Davidson top-10 list for all-
time.

The women’s team put on a good showing
at the Carolina Invitational, giving Andrew
reason to be optimistic for the SoCon Indoor
Championships.

“This meet was a real confidence booster
for the team, coming off of a somewhat flat
effort the previous weekend,” Andrew said.

The women’s team received very strong
contributions from two runners, Caroline
Sanker ’09 and Emily King ’09, who fin-
ished eighth and 11th, respectively, in the
3000-meter race.

“We are excited and feeling good
about where we are. However, we
know that if we are going to have
a great indoor conference meet,
we’re going to have to maintain
this energy level and continue to
improve.”
--Coach Gary Andrew

The contributions of younger athletes at

. this point in the season can only foreshadow

better things to come both in the rest of this
season and future seasons.

In another strong performance for the
Wildcats, Megal Atias ’08 finished 13th in
the mile run with a time of 5:12.44, a team
best.

After the previous meet, labeled as a flat
performance by Andrew, the men’s and

women’s track teams showed a lot of prom- .

ise and gave their head coach reason to be
optimistic.

“We are excited and feeling good about
where we are,” Andrews said. “However, we

know that if we are going to have a great
indoor conference meet, we’re going to have
to maintain this energy level and continue to
improve.”

Hopefully, since so many personal and
team records were set in this past weekend’s
Carolina Invitational, the team will be able to
move forward with the same intensity.

Only one meet stands between the team

and the SoCon Indoor Championships, and
that is this weekend’s two-day meet at
Clemson.

This meet should prove to be a tell-tale
sign as to how Davidson will enter the cham-
pionships looking for a win.

By maintaining their energy level and
intensity in practice, Coach Andrew said he
believes the team can do just that.
