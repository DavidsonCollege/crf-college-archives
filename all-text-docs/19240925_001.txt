“For What Is Your Life?” is Theme
of, Sunday Address to Students

Dr. Albert Sidney Johnson, pastor of the
First Presbyterian Church of Charlotte, was
the speaker at the vesper service last Sunday
evening. Dr.
Davidson and was
Doctor of Divinity
1923, ©

“T want to speak to you from James 4:14,"
said Dr, Johnson in beginning, “and
that particular phrase ‘For what your
life?’ Perhaps you say that is a trite state
ment, but we must deal with trite things, for
We are facing them day by day.”

He continued by asking again,

“What is
your life?” and explained that James had
in mind “What does life consist of, what is

the outlook and how

is one going to spend

“There are some men,” said the speaker,
“who, like the Stoies, look on life as some-
thing superficial and indefinite. We cannot
accept such doctrines, however, because of
our conscience and beeause the Word of
God tells us that we are not here to dream
or to drift.”

“Then there are others,” he continued,
“who go to the school of the infidel. These
go so far us to say there is no God. We
cannot destroy a formula in mathematics by
saying it-isn’t true, neither can we get
otf God by denying Him."

He then spoke of a third class who go to
the school of the world. He said these are
the ones who were looking forward to get-
ting all they could out of life. He gave a
very striking illustration of one man whose
only object in life was the accumulation of
worldly goods.

“There are others,” Dr. Johnson said, “who
go to the school of materialism. They try
to account for man and life elsewhere than
in the Word of God. What is your life?
The orily way for a person to find the an-
swer to that question is in the school of
Christ. Many people do not know the real-
ity of life, but in the school of Christ we
find that life is real, that our lives are for a
definite purpose. Then in Christ's school.we
learn that life is service. We do not want
an education to fit us so that we can gain
everything in the world. We want our edu-
cation so that we will be better fitted to
glorify God with our lives in service. Last
of all life is Christ. ‘No one really lives
outside of Christ for in Him is life.”

He ended by bringing a straightforward
challenge for everyone to go forward in
their lives for Christ.

The music was led by Simil Bryant, and
special music was furnished by a quartette
composed of Lockhart, Hudson, Wilson and
Fitts. A.M. Martin read the scripture and
Harry Price and Hayden Hollingsworth led
in prayer.

Acts to be Presented to
Students

If an early start means anything in the
success of “Junior Speaking,” then the class
of '26 is going to make everyone sit up and
take notice with their stupendous celebration
next spring! The boys of '26 have started
to work with vim and vigor, and during the
past week have put into active operation a
plan that will finance their spring festivities.

They are sponsoring the appearance of
four of the Piedmont-yceum Bureau's star
acts in Shearer Hall at different times dur-
ing the school term, and the proceeds from

Enrollment This
Year Is Largest
Ever for College

The Davidson student is steadily
growing in numbers. This record-
breaking enrollment was 615, exceeding last
year's total by 40. Every effort has been
made to accommodate the applicants for ad-
mission, but many were turned away.. The
number allowed to enter at that taxes the
facilities of the college to the very utmost.

The enrollment by classes shows the usuat
proportion, The Freshman class leads with
a total of approximately 260 men. This is
the largest first-year class in the history of
the institution, surpassing the record set by
last year’s men, who opened with 240.

The Sophomore class numbers 175, the
Junior 82, and the Senior 83, giving a total
of 340 regular upper-classmen. There are
12 special students enrolled and two candi-
dates for the degree of M.A.

The geographical distribution of the stu-
dents tells the story of Davidson College's
strength in the Southern States. North
Carolina supplies.more than half the number
with 364 men, South Carolina leads the re:
maining Southern States with 57. Georgia
comes a close third with 55, and Alabama
fourth with 26. Tennessee has 25 represen-
tatives in the student body. Virginia 17
Florida 16, Mississippi 13, West Virginia 12,
Kentucky 7, Louisiana 6, Texas 1, Arkansas

The division of courses finds the A.B.2
in the lead with 243 candidates, B.S.1 has 194
enrolled, B.S.2 has 114, and A.B.1, the purely
classic course, has 39. There are 11 Pre-
