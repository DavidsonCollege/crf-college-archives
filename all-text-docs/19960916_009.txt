THE DAVIDSONIAN

ye te

Scott Lafranchi

When will we ever learn?A
couple of years ago, Rob Knight, a
highly involved and very moti-
vated member of the Intervarsity
Christian Fellowship, submitted his
application for anIVCF leadership
_ position. He was epitomizing the
Davidson tradition; he was going
beyond the academic requirements.
But shortly after Rob submitted

his application, he was informed

by a member of the organization
that he was ineligible for leader-
ship. No, Rob.did not practice pat-
terns of gossip and slander; drunk-
enness; pre-marital sex; selfish
ambition; lewdness, and by no
means hatred. Why then was he
denied? Why then was he turned
away even before a free demo-

cratic vote? Rob had his desire to be
a leader in his religion revoked be-
cause he is different in the eyes of
the ignorant. Rob is gay.
According to the Davidson
powers that be, we are gathered
together in these serene surround-

ings and this highly intellectual -

community “to liberate the minds

of young men and women for use- -

ful lives of leadership and service.”
Hence, Davidson students reacted
with courage and reason when
Rob’s story was revealed to us. In
due time, our Student Government
debated this issue with great pas-
sion and diction, and rendered their
decision which essentially stated
that since “The Senate of Davidson
College does hereby condemn dis-

because they prevent homosexu-
als from obtaining leadership po-
sitions in their organization.

When a group is chartered by
Davidson College, they are en-
titled to official status which en-
tails use of school letterhead and
absolute affiliation with Davidson.
In addition, they are free to re-
quest funds and office space for
their business, As a result of what
a charter status means, the SGA
refused to renew the IVCF charter
because it would in effect be con-
doning discrimination.

However, IVCF appealed the

Somewhere in the vast ex-
panse of Baker parking lot stands
acar. That car belongs to me. If
one were to see it one would no-
tice something is missing. That
something is a 1996-97 Davidson
College parking permit.

Along with other returning
students this year, I was shocked
at the twenty dollar increase in
parking costs. Vice President
Business and Finance Robert
Norfleet in Issue #2 of The
Davidsonian gave reasons for the
price hike. He mentioned an ef-
fort to “keep [tuition] costs down”
and our low parking costs in com-
parison to other regional schools.
The rate of other schools is unim-
portant. Other schools of our size
in this region do not charge over
$100,000 for an education. Other
schools are not Davidson! I do
think it’s cute, however, that they

are keeping tuition down by raising
permit prices up. Who are they
kidding?

With therise in prices and state-
ments like these I expected out-
rage! I expected protest! I ex-
pected too much. Gasps of shock
quickly transformed into the clink
of student coins in the college cof-
fers. Why was there no action?
Perhaps because the Freshman had
never known any differently. Oth-
ers maybe had no qualms about
handing out twenty more dollars of
mommy and daddy’s money. Tell
mé I’m wrong. The SGA did
launch an investigation of the whole
affair in their very first meeting and
proposed to study it over the next
seven weeks. I praise their action
and it may help next year, but the
time to act is now!

Actually the time to act was
then. The momenthas passed. The

accountants have won. Davidson
has its money, but not mine. It
may seem silly to you for me to get
worked up over twenty dollars,
butitis more the principle than the
money. Not every Davidson stu-
dent is affluent. With the increase
in tuition every year, more stu-
dents with wealth of mind, but not
of pocket, are shut out from our
community and we are the poorer
for it. At a school that praises
diversity yet no longer gives full
financial aid to qualified butneedy
students, any price increase is a
major one.

This is true for some and
should be a concern for all. The
permit price increase is harmful,

- unnecessary, and unjustified and
until Mr. Norfleet or another ad-
ministrator gives us a good reason
for it, we have no reason to be-
lieve otherwise.

decision. One might say, what new
evidence did they have to prompt
their appeal? No, they did not have
any undisclosed moral issues, but
they did have a request from the
President and the Dean of Students
for the SGA to reconsider its deci-
sion. Remember that it was not an
order, but rather a mere sugges-
tion. It was at this time that the
SGA should have thought back to
the origin of education.

They should have remem-
bered the purpose of Davidson,
and recalled that this institution is
for the students and not for any
other.

Ultimately, the SGA buckled
under the pressures of the adminis-
tration and the Presbyterian church,

and voted to charter the IVCF.
Furthermore, they changed the very
foundation of the SGA. It now
reads, “That the Senate of Davidson
College does hereby condemn dis-
crimination based on “race, color,
religion, national origin, age, dis-
ability, sex, and sexual orientation
except where appropriate and al- ~
lowed by law.’”

My fellow Davidsonians, dis-
crimination is never appropriate,

. even when it is allowed by law,

and as a Presbyterian, and a
Davidson College student, I be-
lieve that we should never rest
until every member of this com-
munity is truly ‘free to liberate
their minds for useful lives of lead-
ership and service.’

Okay—I’ ve now been at Davidson for two years and I am finally
fedup. After enduring literally hundreds of inbred cracks, armpit-of-
the-nation comments and Forrest Gump jokes, I am at last going to try
to set the record straight about my home state. Yes; that’s right—my
name is Rachel...and I’m from Alabama. I’ mtired of hanging my head
in shame—It’s time to get everything out in the open about Alabama,
both good and bad, so I can go on with my life.

Maybe there are a few hard-core redneck facets to life in Alabama;
I can admit that. So maybe Talladega is the home of the International
Motor Sports Hall of Fame; and the Hank Williams Jr. International
Fan Club headquarters might just happen to be in Cullman near the
Key Underwood Coon Dog Memorial Graveyard—fine, BIG DEAL.
And so what if our governor decided to switch our highways to the
metric system, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on new
kilometer markers that no one in the state really understands. Who
caresif our public schools are ranked among the worst in the nation...why
dwell on the negative? Ican just laugh that much harder at the Andover
and Exeter graduates because I still got into Davidson with my free
Alabama education.

There are so many amazing things about Alabama that people
often overlook that I could never provide a complete account, but
allow me to educate you as succinctly as possible...

Did you know that the world’s largest space museum is in Huntsville,
Alabama? Did you know that Jimmy Buffett, Willie Mays, Courtney
Cox, Charles Barkley, Truman Capote, Joe Lewis and Helen Keller
are all Alabamians? Did you know that the world’s only statue
dedicated to the boll weevil can be found i in Enterprise, Alabama? I'll
bet you didn’t.

We are not a bunch of inbred, toothless, pick-up drivin’, racist
crackers—this is an unfair, uninformed generalization. Just because
I like grits, Crimson Tide football, country music and say y’all, does
that make me less of a person? I reckon some people think so, but I
don’t care. I’m tired of people snickering when I tell them where I’m
from (and no, for the last time, there is no such place as Greenbow).
I’m from Alabama, and by-God, I’m proud of it. I think Lynard

Skynard perhaps said it best...sweet home, Alabama.
