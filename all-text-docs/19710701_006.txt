Workmen Rush To Complete Renovations

That Davidson is a quiet
and tranquil place in the
summer is certainly a grave
misconception this year as
workmen rush from one
building to another to com-
plete well over $250,000 in
building renovations before
this fall. ~

Director of Buildings and
Grounds Grover C. Meetze
sifts through folders and bluc-
prints constantly in an ef-
fort to keep abreast of the
six individual improvement
projects.

When students retum in
September they will find
that the administration has
expanded, taking over the
entire first floor of Cham-
bers. ;

C. David Cornell and the
business offices have mov-
ed into the wing where
the study rooms previously
were, and the counseling of-
fice has been moved to the
basement where the news
bureau office used to be.

The news bureau in turn
has moved into the admis-
sions ‘and faculty offices.
while the admissions office
has moved into the office
vacated by the business of-
fice. ‘

Two ‘classrooms on the
second floor of Chambers
have been divided to pro-
vide offices for the faculty
members who were pre-
viously located on the first
floor.

The Alumni Offices were
moved into the classroom
opposite where the admis-
sions office used to be. The
vacated alumni offices will
become a reception office
and conference room.

“The purpose in making
these office changes is to
make our administrative lay-
out more effective.’ said C.
David Corneil, vice  presi-
dent for finance and de-
velopment.

“With the mew arrange-
ment we will have the fin-
ance, development and pub-
licity areas at one end of
the buliding under my con-
trol, and the academic, ad-
missions, dean of students.
and registrar at the other
end of the building under
Dr. Bevan's control,’' Cor-
nell said.

The Chambers renovations
will cost $20,000 which will
come out of plant re-
serves, Cornell said.

Grey House. the white
brick building located on
the corner of N. Main St.
and Griffith Street directly
across from the president's
house, is more near to com-
pletion than most of ithe pro-
jects.

A pre-civil war structure,
Grey House is being remod-
eled to serve as a dormatory
for coed exchanges next year
with a maximum capacity
of 14 girls.

The thouse was Structural-
ly sound. The only major
improvements needed were
a roof and waterproofing the
outside masonry. °

Downstairs, there will be
a or. a lounge area,
equipped with kitchen faci-
lities, and three bedrooms.

Ups:airs there is space for
four bedrooms and addition-
al bath facilities were in-
stalled. “OP

Meetze said that bedrooms
will be furnished similarly
to the rooms in the regular
dormitories.

Akhough it was originally
hoped that the historic house
could be restored to look as
ix did when it was built, the
college did not enough
money to complete the pro-
ject.

Renovation of Grey house
will cost approximately $40.-
000 according to Vice Presi-
dent for Finance and De-
velopment C. David Cornell.

The $40,000 will be paid
over the years through room
rent of girls staying in the
thouse® Corneil sail.

Also near completion is
Erwin lodge, iocated in a
wooded area east of the
campus. College officials
have been concemed for
some time about recurrent
damage done by vandalism.

To protect against any
further destruction, an apart-

ment thas been built in the.

downstairs area of the old
structure where a young
couple will dive and be
responsible for reporting
maintenance needs and’ oth-
er problems to college of-
ficials.

Upstairs in Erwin Lodge
there will be a large recrea-
thon tall which will accomio-
date approximately 50-75
people.

According to Cornell, all
funds for the nestoration of
Erwin Lodge have been pro-
vided by Mrs. Robert Dyer
of Chicago, daughter of the
late Professor Erwin.

As for the dormitories ma-
jor work thas begun in the
renovation of Cammon and
improvements in Duke.

Oannon will receive a face
‘lifting on the same scale
that Bast ...er.. . Sen-
telle received fast year: new

doors and hardware, better

lighting in the corridor, floor
covering in ‘the corridor, new
wardrobes instaliied and new
desks tand bureaus. The new
furniture will be the same
style as that im Sentelle.
The renovation of Cannon
will cost the college $100,
000 which will come out of
the Dormatory Replacement
and Renewal Fund. Although
there presently &s not enough
money in the fund to cover
the cost of renovating, the
college plans to borrow
money and pay it back with
yearly funds derived from a

portion of student room rent.

“We were lucky last year
to Wave received a special
grant from the Duke En-
dowment 'to cover the cost
of renovating Sentelle. But
this year the college will
have to bear the entire cost
of ithe Canmon renovations,”’
Comneli said.

Duke Dormatory will have
modifications including wali
to wall carpeting in each
room, improvement of bath
facilities, @uorescent fight-
ing in the corridors and the
addition of a lounge area in
the central portion of the

building.
Renovation of Duke will
cost ‘approximately $35,000

and wall also come out of
the Dormatory Replacement
Renewal Fund.

Meetze said that routine
maintenance will be done to
the other dorms; however.
he merftioned that students
had destroyed more proper-
ty im the dorms during this

past academic year than he
could ever remember.

Giass was broken out of
many wéndows, boles were
punched through ‘two or
three doors, while other
doors were damaged ‘by
darts and in some cases
knives.

“In one incident a student
deliberately knocked (a clock
off the wall,"’ Meetze said.

“We tad hoped the im-
provements in Gentelle Jast
year would cause students
to be more careful of the
dormatory, but apparently
not,’ Meetze said. ‘Water
fights caused much of the
wile in tthe corridors tto need
replacing. and we found a
mumber of holes punched
through the suspended ceil-
ings.

“The -great amount of
damage*done to the dorms
this year was one reason
why’ dorm counselors were
provided for in the govern-
ance report.’ he said.

Student Body To Receive
New Identification Cards

All Davidson students, fa-
culty, administration and
staff will receive identifica-
tion cards beginning in Sep-
tember, according to Will H.
Terry, dean of students.

During the first week of
school all students must
have their picture taken and
receive their ID card in
Chambers Dining Hail.

“The procedure will only
take about 2-3 minutes,”” said
Terry. ‘‘The college has a
machine which will take the
student’s picture, mount it
on the information card, and
laminate it all in a few min-
utes.”

Terry said that this would
benefit the students in that
they would have an up-to-

The college president's sig-
niture will also appear on the
card to varify that the stu-
dent is truly a member of
Davidson College.

“Another reason we're do-
ing this is because we want
to thave one check point
through which all students
must pass in order for them
to take courses there,"’ Terry
said.

“Previously the adminis-
tration wandered around for
three or four weeks before
they e-tually knew who was
enrolled ‘and who was not,"
Terry said. “This way we
have &@ sure count.”

director of financial aid will

cer said.

“The creation of this po-
sition underscores the belicf
of the union as a program
Tather whan just a building."
Spencer said. ‘‘Peter will
also attempt to integrate
some of the Union activities
with pant of the educationial
program.”

nounced that Ranafl R. Kin-
caid, ‘assistant professor of
cconomics, will serve part-
time in the administration as

ble for defining the career
