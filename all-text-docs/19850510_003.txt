Friday, May 10, 1985 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Dean Ross Promoted To Registrar’s Position

By KELLEY DIXON

When sue Ross became As-
sociate Dean of Students in 1977,
she planned to stay in that position
only four years. Eight years later,
she is moving up (or across the
hall) to the Registrar’s Office.

Before coming to Davidson,
Ross taught in a variety of
academic settings including St.
Mary’s, Queens and UNC at
Chapel Hill where she was Assis-
tant Dean of Women. Ross has
often been mistaken as Dean of
Women for Davidson College.
She is not a single-sex Dean
(Sorry, Sue), though she has done
much work with women at David-
son. She arrived at DC at a time
when women were beginning to
assert themselves after a quiet
period of quiet struggling to prove
that they belonged here and could
hold their own academically. In
Ross’s first year, Rusk was started
as a women’s center to initiate
programming concerning
women’s issues. After Rusk be-
came more of a social outlet, Ross
and others materialized need for a
women’s center in Kimmel house,
but the organization was, short-
lived.

Participating as the Dean’s of-
fice representative for the Union
Board, Dean Ross was instrumen-
tal in starting the Women’s Con-

Associate Dean of Students Sue Ross

cerns Committee and the Interna-
tional Committee. When she must
be pinned down to specific duties
she has had as Assoc. Dean of of
Students, Ross lists the orienta-
tion of transfer students an inter-
national students. As a member of
the English Department, Ross has
been able to continue academic
pursuits as well as to facilitate
broader relationships with stu-
dents. Being the first in her posi-
tion to also teach, Ross feels that

her academic contact has aided re-
lations between faculty and ad-
ministration. Her first-year En-
glish classes were confined to the
freshman level, but now she only
teaches uppper level literature
courses.

In her effort to make student
contacts in varied groups of men
and women, Dean Ross has been
“involved in as many types of life
as possible.” She offers dedicated

support to Davidson athletics,

especially intramural, and 1s an
avid theatre fan, missing only
three workshop productions in her
eight years. As a result of her
broad student contact, Ross's job
became increasingly _counsel-
oriented. She is constantly oc-
cupied with the “normal growing
pains” of college students. Her ad-
vice is sought during family crises
and career decisions, she helps
students cut through administra-
tive red tape, and she refers stu-
dents to the proper channels when
she cannot help.

“Davidson College is the kind
of environment where risk can be
taken,” says Ross. ‘And that in-
volves failure and success.” As
Assoc. Dean of Students, her at-
titude has been one of encourag-
ing growth while respecting limi-
tations. Her disciplinary attitude
is to help the student deal with the
consequences of his/her actions
while rationally accepting the
gravity of the offense. She feels
that it is crucial for students, as
young adults, to learn the princi-
ple of cause and effect concerning
their actions.

Ross said that every year after
her fourth, she has made a con-
scious career decision to stay in
the Dean’s Office, and this year
she was not seeking promotion.
Her duties as registrar will include
the adminsitration of the academic

regulations of the faculty, coordi-
nation of student and faculty
academic schedules, evaluation of
any academic work done outside
Davidson for transfer, registration
of students, and execution of the
self-scheduled exam system (no
pun or preophesy intended). She
will also actively maintain her
position in the English Dept. as a
teaching member. Her only fear
about her new job involves the
concept that as one moves up in
Administration, one also moves
away from students. But because
Ross is already perceived as an ac-
cessible member of the faculty,
there will probably be an_ in-
creased amount of traffic through
the Registrar's Office. Ross's pro-
motion makes her an officer of the
College, and places her on the
President's Administrative Staff.
She was approved for the position
by the Executive Committee of
Faculty and Trustees.

Dean Terry will select the new
Assistant Dean of Students to join
him and Asst. Dean Paula Miller.
Ross has no strong feeling as to
whether the new person be male or
female since both groups have a
representative in the Dean's Of-
fice presently. Whether Terry
chooses someone from within the
College or initiates a nationwide
search, he wants to fill the gap
quickly.
