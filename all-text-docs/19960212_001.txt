Trustees confirm ties with church

Resolution is first put forth by the Ad Hoc Committee on Church Relations

By Mary Care JALONICK
Executive Editor

In their first step toward ad-
dressing the monumental issue of
church relatedness, the trustees
confirmed Davidson’s ties with the
Presbyterian Church, USA, Fri-
day.

The resolution was put forth

by the Ad Hoc Committee on
Church Relations, headed by
Trustee Ben Barker of Chapel Hill.
The trustees unanimously accepted
the proposal.

While Davidson does not have
a formal covenant with the Pres-
byterian Church, this resolution
marks the beginning of a series of
proposals that will officially estab-

, area,

lish ties between the two.

However, in comparison to
other Presbyterian colleges in the
says President John
Kukyendall, Davidson is “moving
with less speed towards establish-
ing a covenant.”

Barker will not comment on
otherchurch-related issues that the
committee discussed, but says that

the issues of faculty, trustee, and
presidential religion will be pre-
sented to the committee at a later
date. The next meeting is sched-
uled for April 19.

“The trustees are taking [these
matters] with all seriousness, and
we are making decisions in the
appropriate time,”’says
Kukyendall.

Search
begins for
president

Faculty and
students to
assist trustees

The Board of Trustees will

have the final say on who is to be _

“the tiext President of Davidson,
butitis also seeking guidance from
numerous sources in making its
decision.

Following the methods they
used in 1983 during the last Presi-
dential search, the Trustees have
commissioned the help of the Aca-
demic Search Consultation Ser-
vice (A.S.C.S.) and will work with
both faculty and student advisory
committees.

The A.S.C.S. is a non-profit
organization which helps colleges
and universities find presidents to
fit their needs. Christine Young, a
former teacher, dean, provost, and
acting-president, and Dr. John
Chandler, former President of Wil-
liams College, are the representa-
tives who will lead the pre-search
study. .

“We are here as teachers,
coaches, and presidents, not as
people who ‘do’ presidential
searches,” said Young in an open
forum held in Chambers Gallery
last Wednesday.

The duo arrived on campus
last Tuesday, and have spent most
of their time meeting with small
groups of Davidson students and
faculty to get a feel for what the
campus wants in a new president.

The forum held Wednesday
was attended by roughly 20 fac-
ulty, all of whom had definite ideas
of what the next president should

“Davidson is not going to
walk away from our ties,” says
Barker, “We intend to strengthen
them.”

Kukyendall hopes that by
strengthening Davidson’ s ties with
the church “we can find additional
ways to perform service and sup-
port to one another.”

BREAKING NEW GROUND

: Josh Glazer
“Let’s break ground!” yelled Habitat for Humanity Construction Director Sophomore
Ben Kinnaman. At that, Davidson President John Kuykendall, Danny Jetton, Etheleen
Jetton, and Kinnaman simultaneously pushed their shovels into the earth as Jetton
children Danny Junior, Joey, and Kristopher look on. This patch of land will eventually
hold a home for the Jettons, built by the hands of Davidson students as a part of the
college’s first Habitat for Humanity project.

When he realized he had blown his
entire savings for the semester, she
treated him to “cheeseburgers in
the Union” for a couple of weeks.
Apparently she was “pretty
dazzled,” Barton says.

It was “clear early” that this
relationship had potential. Barton
realized, “maybe this relationship
is going to work” when he took her
to the movies for their second date.
She wore anew pair of white pants,

and when she got out of the car
her pants were covered with oil
that had dripped from the dash-
board.

She still wanted to go out
with him, despite the fact that her
new white pants were now brown.
He knew there was potential for a
serious commitment. Barton says
she is “clearly the best thing that’s
ever happened to [me].” They
