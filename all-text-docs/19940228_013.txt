HELLCATS
in the 900 Room

By Tom Mew
Anyone not present in the 900
Room Monday night (and judging
from the size of the crowd, that
was just about everyone on cam-
pus) missed a musical treat.

The featured band, the.

Hellcats, played a strong set of
both original music and cover
tunes. The band is from Mt. Holly
and was formed in 1991 under the
leadership of David Childers.

Childers, who handles vocal
and rhythm guitar duties and is the
band’s chief song writer, has an
extensive background in poetry and
creative writing and has had sev-
eral works published.

The band performed a fine set
of original and cover tunes, which
reflected their eclectic background
ofinfluences. They appeared well-
versed in a number of styles in-
cluding folk, rock, and jazz.

Notable covers included a
strong rendition of Howlin Wolf’s
“The Killing Floor” and an abso-
lutely stellar version of Richard
Thompson’s “Vincent ’52.”

Standout originals included
“Beatrice in the Bushes,” a driving
rock song in the style of Credence
Clearwater Revival, and “Trailer
Park Woman,” in which lead gui-
tarist Irwin Bostion displayedsome
nice Chuck Berry-esque licks.
Bostion was the standout of
the evening and displayed a mas-
tery of several different styles of
playing, including traditional rock
and blues and more country-ori-
ented finger style performance.
Also impressive was bassist
Tim Conard, a thoroughly profes-
sional player whose solid perfor-
mance anchored the band’s sound.
Flute and saxophone player Aaron
Stevenson added some tasteful
embellishments, particularly on
such numbers as “Vampire Blues.”
The band was relaxed and
friendly and appeared unhampered
by the small crowd. Musically,
they played a very tight set with
just enough rough edges to keep
things fun.
Childers, in particular, seemed
quite at ease on stage and provided

an enjoyable feeling of spontane-
ity. The band has already released
two tapes and is currently working
on a CD which should be released
sometime this summer.

Anyone searching for melodic rock
and blues with clever and insight-
ful lyrics should definitely check
out the Hellcats.

Will Reality Bites lose its meaning over time ?

Reality continued from page 12

much better—and her touching
performance here completely re-
deems her nauseating turn inBram
Stoker’s Dracula. Hawke, who
showed us such beautiful corpses
in Dead Poets Society and Alive,
givesa performance full ofsomuch
energy and feeling that you prob-
ably won’t recognize him. Stiller,
as Michael, is charming and attrac-
tive, but the true gem in the film is
Garofalo, who presents Vickie as a
quick-witted, sarcastic wag, while
never fully concealing her heart.
The film boasts pleasing per-
formances from Swoosie Kurtz,

Joe Don Baker, and John Mahoney
(especially Kurtz, as Lelaina’s out-
of-touch mother), and also cameos
by David Pirner of Soul Asylum,
Duff from MTV, the Lemonheads’
Evan Dando, anda Cindy Crawford
spoof from The Firm’s Jeanne
Tripplehorn.

Near the end of the picture,
Michael and Troy are standing in
the rain outside of a Houston bar,
and Michael is explaining why he
has more to offer Lelaina than Troy
could ever hope to offer. He com-
pares Troy to a court jester (in an
obvious reference to Hamlet), and
says, “...people will pick up his
skull and say, ‘I knew this guy! He

was really...funny.’ And that’s it.”

I can’t help imagining Reality
Bites as the jester. It is the only
thing that worries me about this
film—is it so geared toward our
generation that it will lose its sig-
nificance over time? I hope not.

Reality Bites is a credulous
showcase of dilemmas that, de-
spite the references to Peter Framp-
ton and Melrose Place, are univer-
sal. But it is also more than that; it
is aremarkably honest portrayal of
people our age who must go out
and, as Lelaina’s father says, “show
some ingenuity,” while dealing
with the evolution of relationships
that is part of adulthood.
