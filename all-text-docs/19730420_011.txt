By BUCKY

CAPTAIN AMERICA

The 1973 softball season got
off to a staggering surprise for a
few returning teams as the bulk
of the freshmen teams showed
unexpected power in knocking
off a couple of the fraternity
teams

In Wednesday's action most
everything went as expected
however, as the three top teams
in each league won. The Pope
and His Court didn't have to
play as the boys from (C-1
decided not to get the royal
treatment. and didn't even
show at all

Meanwhile, the same thing
was happening next door as the
Errors made a good play in not
showing in their entirety
against the Staten Island Fai-
ries

In games that were played
the super strong Queen and his
12 Very Nice Guys played a
queer game and defeated the
Crankateers rather soundly 26-
6. Ateam to watch for sure.

The KA’s. showing a well
balanced attack. walked over
last vear’s champs and this
year's doormats, the ATO's 18-
3. Hopefully. ATO will get next
vear’s first round draft choice.

In Thursday's action a strong
defensive team known as the
Banging Cannoneers played a

PAX started out the year
meely as they tripped up the
Gamms in all-5 win

The famed Derwood Derbies
jwon their first game convinc-
ingly with a 12-4 stomp over
Cannon Basement as Mike
Deese. Seaton Taylor and Pete
Morgan all hit homers

The Delt seniors got an earls
rest as the Lakers felt like going
to the beach instead of playing
and the Delts picked up the
easiest of wins

On Monday the freshmen let
themselves be heard even
more. W-IV opened the barrage
as they didn't even give Dr
Pepper a chance. clouting the
hapless drinks, 12-7

The always strong SPEs
showed their prowess as they
slugged it out with the unique

Alex and the Droggs team
before beating them into sub-

mission, 17-13.

Two other freshman teams
also won Monday. One was the
fabled W-I Wimps. The Wimps
who recently established a-wim-
pire in their hallowed halls
really jumped out and
conquered F&M #2, 19-1. If thes
are as good as early reports
C.A. and Buck could be eating
some earlier slashing remarks

But C.A. and Buck don't eat
anything, hardly.
