Last Saturday the Davidson
track team jumped into the
deep water of the Furman
News-Piedmort Relays.

The Wildcats fruitlessly com-
peted against the subsidized
teams of the likes of Duke,
Georgia, Ohio State and Ten-
nessee but the team, as a whole,
showed promise.

Today the team takes) on
Guilford in a dual meet here
at 2:30 p.m.

Coach Heath Whittle was
very optimistic about the team’s

Harold Wilkersen drilled a
home run, his second of the
game, in the eleventh = inning
Monday to propel Davidson to
its first baseball win of the
season, 5-4 over Central Mich-

igan.

Coach Tom Stevens was nat-
urally quite pleased with the
win, pointing out that “We beat
a real good ball club. I hope
it's going to be a turnabout for
us.”

Central Michigan, second in
the NAIA last year, forged a 4-2
lead in the top of the ninth, but

run-scoring singles by George

Weicker and Mark Rodgman
sent the game into extra. in-
nings.

“This was our best overall
ball game.” commented Stev-
ons. “We hit when we had Wg.
played good defense and got
good pitching.”

Ross) Manire turned in the
best mound job of the season
for the diamondmen, although
he tired in the late stages. Frank
Folger also pitched well in re-
hef and got credit for the win.

Wilkersen rapped three hits
in four trips and knocked in
four runs in his best plate per-
formance to date.

Linksters Stumble
In Lejeune Tourney

By DAVID MELTON
Staff Writer

The Davidson golf team suf-
fered its first defeat last week-
end in the Collegiate Golf Tour-
nament at Camp Lejeune.

Jim Ray, a sophomore from
Waynesville, North Carolina, and
second on the team, character-
ized the performance by saying
“we didn't play well at all.”

He also added that this tour-
ney slipped up on the team. “We
thought the Furman tournament
Was going to be the first one,”
said Ray.

Rusty Boyd, a junior and
team captain, is the only player
from Davidson who played rea-
sonably well. He had a_ three-
round total of 228 to lead the
team.

Other golfers from Davidson
competing at Camp Lejeune
were Dick Spinner, Sam Mitch-
ener, Roy Reni anu! David Fai-
son. 1
Duke and East Carolina fin
ished the tournament as_ the
number one and two teams, re-
spectively. East Carolina was
the coly other Southern Con-
ference team entered in the
tourney.

Ray feels that East Carolina
and Furman are the two teams
lo beat this year in the South-
ern Conference. He added that
“they both have a lot of scholar-
ship players,” and this is why
they are tough.

The next outings for the team
will be William and Mary to-
morrow and the Furman Invi-

tational Tournament next week-
end. Ray labels the Furman In-
vitational as a “pretty big tour-
nament.” He goes even further
to predict a better showing in
the Furman Invitaticnal now
that ‘we've already got one un-
der our belts.”

pitching staff received yet an-
other blow this week when sen-
ior Mike Frye developed a sore
arm.

“We'll just have to depend on
hitting and better defense and
hope our pitching comes
around,” Stevens sighed.

The veteran Cat mentor is
hopeful that freshmen Dwight
Plemmons and Joe Duncan will
develop into solid hurlers to fill
the void left by injuries to Davis
Beastcn (out for the season),
Rick Pipan and now Frye.

Pipan was X-rayed this week,
and the results will determine
his status for the rest of the
season. It will be at least two
to three weeks before he can
pitch again.

Besides Plemmons and Dun-
can, Stevens singled out Mark
Rodgman, George Weicker and
Bill Todd as other freshmen
who are making key contribu-
tions to the largely-veteran club.

Weicker, an outfielder, “has
good power,” according to Ste-
vens. “He hasn't hit as well as
1 think he will, but he's big
and strong.”

Third-sacker Rodgman played
what Stevens called “his best

game defensively” Monday.
“He's got an excellent arm, and
is hitting the ball real well, but
right at people.”

Another rookie outfielder is
Bill Todd, who “swings a real
good bat and gives us good
depth.” said Stevens.

Looking toward the future,
Stevens commented that ‘‘the
pressure is on our pitchers, but
if we can get cnough runs to
get them a few wins and some
confidence, we'll be okay.”

Wednesday's game with Pfeif-
fer was rained out, so the Cats
carried a 1-3 record into yester-
day's return match with Guil-
ford.

“We're real glad to get a sec-
ond chance at Guilford,” com-
menied Stevens. ‘“‘We hit the
ball hard but right at them
last time.”

ern Conference encounter.

future. They were facing top
notch competition in the News-
Piedmont Relays, but each
member bettered or equalled
his best previous performance.

Tommy Richardson, the con-
ference’s star sprinter, was
sick but ran a 9.9 100-yard dash.
He did not qualify. The winning
time was 9.3 seconds.

“It was one of the finest
meets they had ever had. There
was terrific competition,” said
Whittle.

Whitile was particularly im-
pressed with the prospects of
junior David Crumpler in the
discus, freshman Ricky Bell in
the mile, 880 and mile relays
and Richardson, Mark Connors,
Dave Peaco and Ray Sweeten-
burg in the 440 relay.

Friday against Guilford
Sweetenburg will make a long-
shot attempt at breaking the
school record of 25 individual
poin‘s in a meet. He was Da-
vidson’s best performer at the
News-Piedmont Relays, setting
a new school record of 14.3 in
the high hurdles. This week he
will be entered in the long
jump, high hurdles, 100 yard
dash, 440 relay, mile relay and
possibly the 220 yard dash.

In an_ interview this week
Sweetenburg commented, ‘I'm
further along than last year
about this time. This year I’m
concentrating on the high hur-
dies and I hope to get down ‘o
14.0 by the end of the year.”

Freshman Bob Trumbo com-
bines with Sweetenburg to give
the Wildcats a. strong 1-2 punch
‘mn the high hurdles. His best
effort thus far has been 15.6
seconds.
