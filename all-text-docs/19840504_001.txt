Members of the RACE panel discuss police practices

Campus Police Practices
Questioned At Forum

By DAVID McGEE

A panel including an administrator, ©

students, Davidson police, and the
Mayor of Davidson last night concluded
that incidents of policemen asking black
students for identification without proba-
ble cause should receive immediate at-
tention. Chief of Davidson Police Jack
Warlick began the discussion by asking
for “openess” in solving any problems
between the campus and the police. “If
there are any problems, I hope we can
solve them tonight,” he said.

The discussion was the second forum
sponsored by the RACE (Racial At-
titudes Concerning Everyone) commit-
tee.

Dean of Students Will Terry, senior
Anne Elliott, junior Rod Holman,

freshman Kerry March, Political Science
Professor Marry Thornberry, Mayor

Nancy MacCormac, Chief of Campus
Security Jackie Hughes, and Chief War-
lick made up the seven-member panel.

College Chaplain Charlie Summers

moderated.

Both Warlick .and) Hughes sum-
marized police operating procedures in
asking students for identification. “We
try our best not to harass students,”
Hughes said. Campus police, he said,
only go into dorms when responding to a
call. “‘We want to help any way we can,”
Hughes said.

Three black students on the panel told
the audience of approximately 400 about
several. incidents in which they were
stopped by a Davidson . policeman.
March said at the beginning of the school
year he was confronted by a Davidson
Policeman in Parks’ Rexall Drug Store

Amid protest from four campus or-
ganizations, the SGA Senate Tuesday
night approved 8-6 the Activities Tax
Council’s budget proposal (see graph)
for next year. Quips and Cranks, The
Davidsonian, Hobart Park, and the Mis-
cellany protested both inadequate fund-
ing and the fairness of the ATC decision.

As soon as ATC Chairperson Ester
Kim formally presented the proposal,
members of the four publications pre-
sented arguments protesting the ATC’s
budget. Kim and other members of the
ATC defended their decisions for over an
hour and a half.

Yearbook co-editor Kathleen
Micham said that rising printing costs
more than outstripped the allotted $300
increase over last year’s allotment. She
explained that the difference between
next year’s ATC allotment and publish-
ing costs will leave only $85 to meet ex-
penses for the rest of next year. This re-
mainder would have to cover all
supplies, salaries and production costs,

she said. Last year, Quips and Cranks
had about $3000 more than printing costs
for other expenses. Said Micham,
“We're not asking for a bigger book. It
would be the same size, the same number
of pictures, as the last three years.”

Quips and Cranks’ other co-editor
Jane Cambell countered the ATC’s ear-
lier suggestion that fundraising might
help close the gap. ““We might be able to
raise funds, and we'll try to fundraise as
we have in the past. But we need more
than an operating budget of $85,” she
said. The yearbook faces new costs, she
added, including a new photograph en-
larger. Quips and Cranks requested
$26,500 and received 23,300.

ATC defenders stressed the limited
amount of money available. The total re-
quests from all campus organizations
added up to over $10,000 more than was
available. Union Director William
Brown, -an ATC member, felt that the
ATC did not fully perceive the year-
book’s plight at the time they decided the
budget.

Helen Caldicott To Speak Monday

By ROXANNA GUILFORD

Dr. Helen Caldicott, President
emeritus of Physicians for Social Re-
sponsibility, will speak on “Living in the
Nuclear Age” as an_ internationally
known opponent of both nuclear arms
and nuclear power. She will appear in
Love Auditorium at 7:30 p.m. next Mon-
day.

According to Ruth Pittard, a Char-
lotte member of the anti-nuclear group
SANE, Caldicott opposes the very con-
cept of “‘nuclearism.” Pittard calls her the
“the leading female spokesman on the
nuclear issue,” citing her starring role in
the academy award winning documen-
tary film, Jf You Love This Planet.

Caldicott’s activism began with her
objections “to. the »Ausralian nuclear
power agency. She protested against the

lack of worker education on the dangers
of uranium. As a physician, she dealt
with the results of uranium exposure in
young children.

Caldicott‘s dislike of nuclear
weapons is at least as strong as her dislike
of nuclear power. She began her anti-nu-
clear weapons campaign after the birth of
her first child. In 1972, she helped bring
about an end to France’s atmospheric
testing of nuclear weapons over the
Pacific by mobilizing support in New
Zealand and Australia.

She advocates working through the
present systems to bring about the neces-
sary changes in society. While her sug-
gestions seem drastic to some, she be-
lieves doing things in stages. For in-
stance,-as Pittard points out, she advo-
cates initially only a nuclear arms freeze,

which will eventually lead to disarma-
ment.

In addition to Physicians for Social
Responsibility, Caldicott is involved
with Women’s Action for Nuclear Disar-
mament (WAND), and organization that
encourages people to use their votes to
help eliminate the possibility of nuclear
war. She is also the author of Nuclear
Madness: What Can You Do!.

Pittard terms the appearance of such a
well known speaker as “fate.” Cal-
dicott’s agent contacted the College
union, and Union Program Coordinator
Ann Parker helped set up the event with
Pittard’s help, financial assistance from
numerous organizations, and the spon-
sorship of the Davidson Peace Coalition.
