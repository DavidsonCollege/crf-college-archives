One Third Of Seniors
Have Snapshots Made

A new feature of the 1934-35
edition of QUIPS AND CRANKS
that of securing snapshots of every

ber of the Senior class this
year, has met with only fair re-
sponse so far, according to Bob
Smith, editor. About one-third of
the class have had pictures made
and turned in. All Seniors are
urged to hand in one of these snap-
shots as soon as possible.

The 1 photog ph
be back on the campus in about
two weeks prepared to make pic-
_-tures of all three lower classes as
well as the Senior photographs.
The proofs of the pictures which
were made the latter part of Oc-
tober have been returned and ac-
cepted. Prints of these pictures
can be secured in attractive fold-
ers at a nominal sum.

Pictures of the various fraternity
groups which were made some
time ago will be returned within
a few days for approval.

The staff requests that all stu-
dents having snapshots which they
think would be suitable for pybli-
cation in the year book, please
turn them in, as it is only through
the co-operation of the student
body that the snapshot section will
be successful this year.

PORENSIC GROUP
PLANS oGHEDULE

Alpha Phi Epsilon To Draw Up
Tentative Schedule Of
Debating Trips

will

The Phi chapter of Alpha Phi Epsilon,
national honorary forensic fraternity,
will hold .its second meeting of the year
at ten o’clock next Thursday night.

Plans for the coming year will be dis-
cussed, and possibly a tentative schedule
of trips to be taken to various univer-
sities and colleges throughout the states
by members of the debating’ team will
be adopted. The members will also give
a brief program.

The Phi chapter of Alpha Phi Epsilon
was founded at Davidson in 1923, suc-
ceeding the old “Gavel and Forum Club,”
which had existed here as a forensic or-
ganization for a number of years. Bids
are issued twice a year to men who
show exceptional ability and interest -in
public speaking on the campus. The de-
bating team, literary societies, and Y.
M. C. A. workers are represented. Meet-
ings are held once a month which have
proved valuable in stimulating in forensic
development, both in regard to the indi-
vidual members and to the student body.

The society members have ‘complete
charge of the selection of the freshman
debating team and also the membership
of the varsity team. During the second
semester of each year, the fraternity
sponsors a series of talks by visiting
speakers on problems of the day.

The present student members of Alpha
Phi Epsilon are R. H. Smith, Jr., presi-
dent; Warner DuBose, vice-president ;
D. R. Brandon, secretary-treasurer; G.
H. Brown, D. B. Bailey, R..T. Coit, P.
M. Rogers, W. P. Sprunt, Jr. and A. C.
Stutts.

Physical Ed Students
Take Theoretical Work

The department of Physical Educa-
tion, headed by Captain Norton G. Prit-
chett, is organized into three types of
classes, the most advanced type of these
being devoted to Juniors and Seniors, the
middle one to Sophomores, and the ele-
mentary type to Freshmen.

As most of | the Juniors and Seniors
taking a course in Physical Education do
so with an eye to becoming coaches in
some sport, or possibly professors of
Physical. Education, the work done by
the advanced sections is mostly of a
theoretical nature, During the first sem-
ester the students are considering a text
called “Methods in Physical Education,”
in addition to a number of basic notes.

As the Physical Education department
is working along different lines this year
from those pursued last year, the Sopho-
mores, while their gymnasium work is
done alone, unite with the Freshmen for
the lectures of the first six weeks, as
the two classes are equally without back-
ground in work of this sort.

All students not taking R. O. T. C.
work, or not on some Freshman or Var-
sity athleti¢ team, if not in a Freshman
or Sophomore Physical Education class,
are required to make monthly reports
stating that they have complied with the
college regulation by having taken at
least three hours of exercise per week,
on three separate afternoons.

Appleby Is Heard

At Vesper: Service

Alumnus Chooses ‘“‘The Problem
Of Doubt’? For Evening
Topic
A large crowd of approximately 225
persons was present at Chambers audi-
torium Sunday night to hear the Rev. Jim

vesper services,

The Rev. Mr. Appleby, “Jim” Appleby
as he preferred to be introduced, is a
graduate of Davidson and served as “Y”
secretary here during the years 1926-28.
TIe is now pastor of the Maxton Pres-
byterian church.

The theme of his sermon was “The
Problem of Doubt.” In this he pointed
out the doubts which assail any college
student as he enters into a and
changed environment. He characterized
an “honest doubter” as “one who eagerly
and sincerely digs for facts” to refute

new

his doubts, as contrasted to one who
adopts as his motto “I won't believe what
I can not explain.” His sermon was. in-
teresting throughout and its effectiveness
was accentuated by @ rather personal
style of deliverance.

Dr. Appleby in his sermon recalled sev-
eral reminiscent incidents from his life
at Davidson. During that period, the “Y”
services were conducted in Shearer Hall
since the new Chambers auditorium was
not completed. “It might be interesting
to note,” Mr. Appleby added, “that your
present ‘Y’ Albert MecLure,
was a freshman when I was here.”

The speaker was introduced by John
Newton, of the Senior class, who also
presided over: the» preliminary~-exercises:

tion of “Little David Play Your
Harp,” by the College Glee Club.

Upon graduation from Davidson

the Y. M. C. A, here and remained in
that office for two years, at the end of
which time he entered the Union Theolo
