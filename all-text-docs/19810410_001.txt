PCC preparing for the Commons

By CATHEY BOST
Staff Writer

The Patterson Court Coun-
cil’s (PCC) main task for the
coming year will be ‘‘to help the
Court meet the challenge of the
Commons,” PCC’s new presi-
dent Joni Seehorn of F&M said.

The PCC met with Dean of
Students Will Terry and Busi-
ness Manager Bob Currie last
Thursday to discuss a number
of issues affecting the College’s
social life.

Issues besides the Commons
include the PCC’s role, eating
house finances, security at par-
ties and proposed changes in
the self-selection system.

Construction of the Commons
will force the Court to work
harder to make small group
dining attractive, according to
Seehorn. ‘‘It’s going to be a
challenge to convince freshmen
to leave that brand-new build-
ing next year,’ she said. ‘But
the Court can offer a lot of social
opportunities the Commons will
never be able to.”’

The eating houses will need
refurbishing, Seehorn said. The

each house for house improve-
ments. Next year they will give
$650. ‘‘We’re going to try to
increase it beyond the $650 this
one time,” she added.

“A couple of houses already
have financial problems because
of no waiting lists,’’ Seehorn
said, and warned that financial
risks will increase when the
Commons opens. ‘‘The financial
status of the houses more than
ever depends on the commit-
ment of students to the Patter-
son Court system.”

An eating house, Seehorn
stressed, is ‘‘a student co-op,
requiring responsibility on the
part of every member.”’

The first item on the PCC’s
agenda will be to draft a written
constitution. ‘‘The powers of
the PCC have been nebulous in
the past,’’ Seehorn said. Set up
in 1970, the PCC was supposed
to allocate College funds to
eating houses and fraternities
and to help them ‘‘co-exist.”
The Council is composed of the
president and treasurer of each
fraternity and eating house.

“It’s important that the con-
stitution show what PCC has

been dealing with all along,”
Seehorn said. The group has
helped regulate Court social life,
discussed financial problems,
and provided a liaison between
students and the administra-
tion.

The Council plans to discuss
security at Court parties in an
effort to prevent incidents simi-
lar to the shooting at Hattie’s
Night. Seehorn said the PCC
will appoint a committee to
decide what security measures
are within the range of the
College budget. For example,
the cost of hiring uniformed
guards for every party would be
prohibitive, she said.

The Council will almost cer-
tainly not advocate closing
parties to all non-members of
the host fraternity or eating
house. ‘‘A closed party atmo-
sphere makes some students,
particularly freshmen, feel they
might not be welcome.’’ How-
ever, restricting parties to Da-
vidson students ‘‘would be ter-
rific,"” Seehorn added.

Housing shortage
hits faculty the, worst

By MARVIN OVERBY

Staff Writer

Faculty members are finding it increasingly
- difficult to find an affordable place to live in

French Professor Homer Sutton said that the
College community can expect ‘‘a real crisis in the
. next ten to fifteen years’’ unless housing costs
‘ improve. ‘‘We can’t expect the College to do more
than they’ve done, and it is not their responsi-
bility,”’ he added.

Business Manager Bob Currie said, ‘‘We don’t
guarantee housing for incoming faculty and staff.
We do help.” The College will cut back on student

No X movies

By HOWARD BROWNE
Special to the Davidsonian

Marlon Brando will not be
coming to Davidson this spring.
A College policy that prohi-

bits the showing showing of

X-rated films cut short Pop
Films Chairman Jeff Herrin’s
recent attempts to bring Bran-
do’s Last Tango in Paris to the
campus.

President Spencer introduced
this policy in 1975 when he
prohibited a Pop Film showing
of an X-rated film.

According to Spencer, the
College chooses not to show
X-rated fims because they carry
associations that are not in
keeping with the image of the
College. The College’s choice is

‘comparable to that of any

theater in Charlotte which
chooses not to show X-rated
films.

English Professor Tony Ab-
bott thinks the College should
make exceptions to the policy.
‘“‘We should always be willing to
look at the value of an indivi-
dual work, regardless of its
rating,” Abbott said. ‘‘I think
it is absurd not to show films of
the quality of Last Tango in
Paris,’’ he added.

Herrin said he wanted to
show Last Tango in Paris
because he felt it was ‘‘a
classic film, one that others
could appreciate.’’ Davidsonian

for Davidson

movie critic Nick Graham
agreed with Herrin, describing
Last Tango as ‘‘a profound film
that takes a very close look at
human relationships.’’ He dis-
cussed the movie with students
and found ‘‘a goodly number
under misapprehension about
what the film was and what it
was about.’

Herrin was sympathetic with
the College’s position about
having a standard against X-
rated films per se, but there
should be some room for review-
ing films for their worth in and
of themselves,’’ he said.

Union Director Shaw Smith
was in favor of showing X-rated
films in conjunction with ser-
ious academic studies. He said
that he had ‘“‘toyed with having
a whole symposium about cen-
sorship and its laws.”’

Smith said the policy ‘‘does
not keep people from seeing”
X-rated films. He added, ‘‘We
have never had any real ques-
tion since the policy has been in
effect.’’

The question of whether or
not to show X-rated films is not
unique to Davidson. According
to the National On-Campus
Report, the students at North-
ern Illinois University and Ari-
zona State University are suing
their administrations in protest
of the prohibition of X-rated
films at those schools.

College is expanding its search for minority professors

By BOB FLEMMA
Staff Correspondent

When College President Samuel Spencer came to
Davidsen in 1968, the student body was all male and
the faculty was all white. Spencer said at the time he
wanted to change all that.

Today, largely because of Spencer’s leadership,
women make up about 40 percent of the student body.

But only two non-white professors have joined the
Davidson faculty.
i The Trustees recently approved a new tactic in the
search for minority professors when they passed
Spencer’s proposal to seek and hire minority, especially
black, faculty members regardless of their fields.

Vice-President for Academic Affairs Price Zimmer-
mann said this may result in several departments’
gaining an extra professor. He also emphasized that
this effort to recruit minority faculty members will be
unaffected by the current College policy which limits
the number of full-time faculty members to 100.

The Muse Paper -

inside!

College President Samuel Spencer believes the
procedure is unique to Davidson. ‘‘As far as I know,
this kind of search procedure has never been done
anywhere else,’’ he said.

However, the process is complicated because the
number of qualified black professors is small and they
are in great demand.

Philosophy department Chairman Earl MacCormac
and Minority Committee Chairman Cynthia Grant
said that, although the College is extremely receptive
to black faculty candidates, the candidates themselves
may not be as receptive to the College.

Also, because of the great demand for minority
professors, minority applicants often command a salary
which small colleges such as Davidson cannot afford to
pay.

According to Minorities Committee and Black
Student Coalition (BSC) member John Eley, salaries
will be ‘a major obstacle in attracting minority

- applicants. He said controversy could arise if minority

faculty members were hired with significantly greater
salaries than current faculty members.

Another problem is how to contact potential
applicants. ‘“‘In many cases it is against the law to
advertise specifically for minority applicants. We've
tried to advertise in some professional journals which

are widely read by minority audiences,’’ Eley said.

MacCormac said he recently received 108 applica-
tions for a position in the Philosophy department. None
of the applicants were black.

Grant said the Minority Committee, the BSC, and
several current faculty members will provide Zimmer-
mann with a list of outstanding black scholars. The
College will then contact these potential applicants.

BSC President Andre Kennebrew predicts the
procedure will be successful. “I am pleased by this
step, and I hope the‘ College's efforts will not stop
here,” he said.

Grant agreed that the procedure is ‘‘an important
step” in increasing minority representation on the

ty.

Spencer said the College would like to hire one or two
minority faculty members within the next year or so,
but added, ‘We've gotten a late start on this year, so it
could take more time than we had originally
