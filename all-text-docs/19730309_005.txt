Duke Authorizes Borrowing for Aid

Last week, the Executive Committee of the Duke
University Board of Trustees approved a plan under
which-the university would borrow substantial funds
for student financial aid. Duke would borrow this
money from its endowment as well as from com-
mercial banks. The funds would then be passed on as
loans to students who would absorb the interest on
the loans in their own payments.

Guy Solie, special assistant to Duke President
Terry ‘Sanford, explained that the university needs
these additional funds for financial aid, or “it will
become a school for rich people. who can afford it, or
for poor people, who are subsidized.’ Solie pointed
out that the amount of funds generated for financial
aid through gifts has been fairly ‘‘constant’’ and
therefore inadequate to meet rising costs.

Voluntary Chapel
Fits College Needs

By BROWN PATTERSON
Professor of History

Inhis ‘Studies in Classic American Literature.’ D. H. Lawrence
argued that men are deceived when they think they will find
freedom in some distant land across the sea. or in some Wild West
still unspoiled by civilization. Men find freedom. he said. by
belonging to “a living. organic, believing community. active in
fulfilling some unfulfilled. perhaps unrealized purpose.”’

Davidson probably fits Lawrence's description reasonably well.
As difficult as it may be to define. there is some discernible purpose
to our common life together in this collection of brick buildings un-
derneath the pines.

As a community. we believe quite a lot. The heritage of Greece.
Rome. Israel. and the Christian Church can still be felt as a living
presence--and not just in the Humanities course.

There is. however. one thing that we lack. and its absence in a
community such as this has puzzled me for some time. Back in the
unreformed early ‘60's the college had required daily chapel and
Sunday Vespers. Very often these services lacked the quality of
true devotion.

There was one occasion on which a student, seemingly strucy, un-
conscious by the force of something a speaker had said. was passed
over head trom hand to hand until he disappeared out of sight at the
rear of the audiiorium

When a movement to do away with compulsory chapel got under
way. | Was happy to support it) But what I did not understand then,
and still do not understand, is why there shouldn't-be a voluntary

related to the concerns of students. faculty, and staff. and ex-
pressing something of the commitment and common purpose ot
this community

Those who have not experienced the deep satisfaction of such
worship have missed a great dea. In a book on the subject of church
sponsored higher education, Manning Pattillo says that the best
ehurch college “surrounds its students with opportunities for full
development--intellectual, religious, moral, artistic. social.”

By not making an opportunity for worship available, the college
has hardly fulfilled the kind of program Pattillo describes.

Yet there are many students here who want a service of worship
and many others who might respond to the opportunity if it were
available. We have about a dozen ordained faculty members, any
one of whom could conduct a service of worship.

There are a number of local clergymen who are interested in
working with students. There are many dedicated laymen with
special skills to contribute toa religious service.

In addition, the Davidson College Presbyterian Church and Lingle
Chapel are conveniently located on the campus. There are student
musical and dramatic groups which might welcome a chance to
participate. Local choirs, black as well as white, could be invited
for special occasions.

All the ingredients seem to be here. The YMCA even has a com-
mittee working on plans for a campus-wide service. Can't we begin
soon?
