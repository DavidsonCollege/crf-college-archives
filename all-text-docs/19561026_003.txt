FRIDAY, OCTOBER 26, 1956

SO IT STARTED

Today’s game on Richardson Field between Davidson
and W&L was the first encounter with soccer for many
spectators. Some undoubtedly wondered how this foreign
sport found its way to the local campus.

_ ia

scoTT ;

Shortly after taking over the position
of Director of Athletics in 1955, Dr. Tom
Scott noted that the only suitable sport
not already offered at Davidson was
soccer. That year he introduced the game
as a required game for freshmen in the
physical training program.

It was hoped that enough interest
would be generated to expand it to an
intermural and then in a few years to
even a varsity sport. However, the re-
sponse was instantaneous and amazing.

Immediately a latent interest made itself known.
Many boys who had played the sport in prep schools and
others who enjoyed the “new” game pounced on the op-
portunity, and under the direction of student coaches
Peter Ramm, Ross Smyth, and Danny Crates, organized a
freshman team.

NOT A WET BLANKET

The boys urged Dr. Scott to get them an intercollegiate
game. The result was a post season contest with the Univer-
sity of North Carolina Freshmen, which the Tar Babies won
4-0, but the loss was no damper. Instead it heightened in-
terest and provided the future team with a mentor.

After the match Dr. Scott noticed
Dr. J. W. McCutchan, probably the
faculty's most active supporter of
Davidson athletics, nimbly manipu-
lating a soccer ball with his foot. As
a result of the ensuing conversation
the English professor agreed to coach
the squad as a varsity sport if en-
thusiasm continued.

NOW TWO

During the remainder of the past school year a group of
the players negotiated with the athletic department, and this
fall it was officially announced that Davidson would become
the second Southern Conference college to boast a soccer
squad, W&L being the other.

This season they play a six-game schedule which will be
expanded to eight in 1957 and probably to ten the following
year. The team gained experience in their opening game with
Duke which the Blue Devils won 9-0. The Cats’ surprisingly
strong showing in holding UNC, runner-up in the ACC last
indicated they had learned their lesson well.

WILDCAT GRIDDERS ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT “NEW LOOK”’

By JIM PAGE

“V.ML" said Coach Dole, “is

going to be plenty rough. There’s

no two ways about it. They’ve got
the running plus a good defense
and fine spirit.”

It was three o'clock in the lock-
er room. The squad was suiting
up for another afternoon of sweat.
Coach Dole continued.

“If you want proof of their
toughness just take a look at
the record. They beat Rich-
mond and Richmond whipped
Citadel and ft guess you re-
member what happened when
we went to see the Cadets. The
teams that have beaten them
are squads such as Army and
LeHigh.... . both big time
schools.”

“What's the reason for our new| play. Of course

emphasis on running?”

“Well, it started last year when
teams like Wofford took our de-
ception and faking and just ram-
med it down our throats. Right
then I decided we had better get
a good straight ground attack. So
now we've got three series. . .The
dive and the inside and outside
bellys. The outside belly is Coach
Thompson's baby.”

“What are our chances Satur-
day?”

“Well, let's ‘just say V.M.I. has
a good squad but so do we.”

Dave McClain was tieing his shoe

“The type of football we're
playing this year is another
good thing. The blocking as-
Signments are simpler and
more effective. it’s almost like
a tone in basketball... . you

in your area.

“How do I think the team com-
pares with last year?”

“Well, I think we want to win
more but we're still lacking in
depth. As long as we don't have
too many injuries we should play
better ball.”

Dick Belton, senior quarterback,
also likes the new ground attack.

OUT OF BOUNDS? Davidson's Don Campbell (43) caught Dick Belton’s pass for an apparent
touchdown in last Saturday’s game, but the officials ruled that he was out of the end zone. A
fraction of a second after the shot was taken Campbell leaped into the air, grabbed the ball and
felt out of bounds. The Cats won easily without the tally, however, as they downed Stetson 43 to 7.

Wm. & Mary Spills
Cross Country Squad

Davidson's cross country squad
suffered its worst defeat in several
years against an amazingly strong
William & Mary team at Williams-
burg, Va., Monday:

Only Angus McBryde, the new
star of the Wildcat: harriexs,
could in any way give the Indians
a fight, and he did with a third
place.

Bob DeTombe, runner-up in last
year’s Conference meet, was
a never-threatened winner, while
Bassett of W&M, one of the new
freshman stars on the squad,
nipped McBryde in the last phase
of the race. Eight other W&M-
runners finished ahead of David-
son's second man, Henry Brown.

Wildcat of Week

Outstanding all year long in. Davidson’s powerful: line,
Dave Fagg has been named Wildcat of the Week for his out-

standing performance last Saturday against the Hatters of

Stetson University.

Fagg is known on the Wildcat
squad for his rough aggressive
brand of football and this is the
type of game he played last Sat-
urday. He pestered. the Stetson
eleven throughout the game, es-

I'll tell you ohe reason we've been
able to. Coach Ratterree is making
those linemen tough. Your own

That’s where the games are won

Bill Gramely, senior end, who

last year also commented on the
new offense.

“It seems like I haven’t caught
a pass all year,” he said, “But like
the others said, as long as we're
moving on the ground why take
to the air.

“Another thing I like this year
is the sharp competition among
the ends. It keeps us from being
lazy knowing there's someone
ready to take your spot at any

like Westerfelt and WaJl I know

I've come in contact with top ball

body in the conference. That kind

Davidson Soccer Squad
Clashes With Generals

This afternoon at 2:00 p.m. Davidson’s new soccer team battled with the Generals of
Washington & Lee on Richardson Field. The homecoming crowd watched as the booters
played their third game of a six-encounter schedule.

Last Friday the determined Da-
vidson squad showed new spirit in
a 2-0 loss to the powerful Univer-
sity of North Carolina team at
Fetzer Field in Chapel Hill.

BUTLER SHINES

Led by the numerous fine saves
of goalie Freddie Butler, the Wild-
cat defenses completely frustrated
the scoring drives of the veteran
Tar Heel front line throughout
the first half.

Midway in the third quarter,
left inside Tom Rand of the Tar
Heels deflected a Davidson half-
back's kick into the goal to give
UNC their first. score: .

At the beginning of the fourth
quarter, a perfect pass from left
wing John Foster to right wing
Rick Grausman set up Carolina's
second and final score.
