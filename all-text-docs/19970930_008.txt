8 _. THE DAVIDSONIAN

; pparently, after last week’s is
A= came out, several people
told me that the coverage of
Ryan
Gist’s trial
was “sen-
sational.”
Consider- ;
ing we re- > atts Bes
produced a
transcript of the entire trial so that people
could have a completely objective
source from which to form their own
’ opinions, I disagree.

Actually, there was something very
sensational about last week’s events,
but it had to with trial itself, not our
coverage. I hope people were shockéd
by the trial’s actual proceedings. The
only thing missing was the kangaroo.
The flags and the hymn-chanting were
not to blame..Considering the ludicrous
charges against Gist in the first place,
such antics were appropriate.

What I found most appalling was
the procedure the trial followed. First,
who really knows how the law should

phil

be applied or tried in such matters? The
whole debate about whether a Solici-
tor-asked question that was “leading”
or not exemplifies
this. The Solicitor
merely changed a
question from “Did
you know...,” which I
guess is “leading” —
seeing as it wasn’t al-
lowed—to “Were you aware...,” which
I guess is not “leading” — since it was
allowed. It was even stranger that stu-
dents on the Council were allowed to
ask questions. What jury is allowed to
interrogate the defendant? I do not
think any jury in America has such
ability. What does it say about the
efforts of the Solicitors and the Defense
Advisors if the jury can just chime in
right afterwards?

The prospects for a miscarriage of
justice are large as long as the Council
has this right. A councilperson might
have a pre-conceived notion about what
they believe is the appropriate outcome,
and use this power to direct the pro-

Op-EbD.

ceedings in such a direction. It could
happen. Did you ever think a student
would be tried for patriotically taking
down a flag hung improperly?

For example, one councilperson
asked if Gist was intoxicated. This
should not be allowed. The defendant
should only be prosecuted by the So-
licitors, not the judges or jury. If Gist
was indeed intoxicated, the responsi-
bility lies on the Solicitors to ask it, not
on the jury. A system where both the
prosecution and the jury can prosecute
the defendant borders on double jeop-
ardy. It creates a guilty-until-proven-
innocent environment. The procedure
needs to change before someone else
with a weak case against them gets
punished by a system which puts the
burden of proof on the defendant and
then lets Solicitors, as well as the jurors,
prosecute him.

Next, as someone asked during
the question session, no one even checks
tosee ifthe jury was “contaminated” by
what they-knew about the case before
the actual trial. A jury that is tainted or

influenced by any other events, save for
the actual trial, again creates the possi-
bility of the defendant receiving an un-
fair trial. Perhaps councilpeople are in-
structed to abstain from reading about
possible trials or listening to gossip
about someone who they might be judg-
ing. There could even be a precursory
check to see if those councilpeople serv-
ing on_a certain trial did not hear too
much about the case beforehand.

Time to take a closer look at the Honor Council

countability to make sure the student
body is actually getting what they
wanted in selecting the representatives.

lege faculty, staff, and student body.

had their “faith lessened”

in the honor system.
However, there are

ways to fix the problems.

Finally, I am worried about what
could happen if someone gets elected
onto. the Honor Council that simply is
not acting professionally or fairly. We
should not worry about the
councilpeople at Gist’s trial, but what if
someone else got elected that did not
behave as they did? There is no ac-

Luckily, Gist’s decision was cor-
rect, though it scared me that it took
some two hours to decide that. We need
to change this system before it hurts
someone else whose circumstances
might be less clear — but just as unwor-
thy of sanctions — as Gist’s.

experience has been unique, though
many people assure me that
Davidson’s sys-
tem leaves a lot
to be desired.
But this experi-

chanted with all
of the advances
designed to make
life easier. Col-
lege has presented me with yet another
form of technology: e-mail.

Quick, cheap and easy are the
words that immediately come to mind.
E-mail becomes a reality when that
first phone bill rolls in. Some quickly
become addicted, and for many it be-
comes the only way to stay in touch. I
must admit, there appéar to be few
potholes in the information superhigh-

anything but thrilled. E-mail is es-
sentially a high-caliber gun for shoot-

the words. Anyone who has ever torn

words of a friend or loved one and
truly appreciated them would know

the feeling.

I would ‘get connected, or log on, or

the beginning of a relationship with
the computer based on mutual hatred.
It seemed as though the computer could

have been deprived of the ease and
efficiency which supposedly charac-
terize this grand system.

The computer is forever termi-

who have witnessed my feeble attempts
to e-mail have been baffled by the
numerous warnings and threats which

E-mail will keep you in touch,
but it will never allow you to truly
connect with another person. Human
expression is one of the oldest
struggles we know, and e-mail sig-
nals a surrender, a stalemate at best.

I am not calling for a complete
abandonment of e-mail, but rather a
contemplation.

College: A concentrated existence

ere at Davidson, and probably at
all colleges, there is a remarkable
phenomenon of intensity and concen-
tration. Everything happens faster and
is more accessible than at any time in
life.
High school life brings with it a
separation
of each of
our activi-
ties, pur-

utilize to the fullest.

This seed-bed of talent and experi-
ence naturally fosters a community in
which learning is done from one’s peers.
While this situation is present in many
different areas of life, it realizes its full
potential in the residential college set-

ting.

Living in close
proximity to fellow stu-
dents and classmates ac-

suits, and
goals, Ev-
erything
happens in
a discrete location with plans made ac-
cordingly.

In college, on the other hand, ev-
erything becomes grouped and distinc-
tions are blurred. German classes meet
in the same roomas philosophy classes.
Meetings on far-ranging topics and di-
verse topics occur in the same location
with only quick breaks between subject
and attendance changes.

Nothing is far away, and access is
granted to all.

Inhigh school, to become involved
in an activity was always somewhat of
an undertaking. You had to reserve not
only the time for the meeting in your
schedule; but also plan for the monu-
mental task of returning to school once
you have left for the day. This is never
an issue in higher education. For better
or worse, you almost never leave col-
lege while you’re there.

College offers a wide selection of
activities with no preconceived notions
of who should belong to different groups
or participate in different activities.

’ Tam constantly amazed at all of
the skills that the people on my hall
possess. No one is a purely one-dimen-
sional person — everyone has multiple
talents and interests, all of which they

celerates everything that

would normally occur

among the members of a

group. Friendship is the

most notable example which comes to

mind. The people with whom I have

become friends since arriving here are

most likely the people with whom I

would have become friends in another
setting.

Living together and seeing them

on a daily and almost 24-hour basis —

the time that we started doing this none
of us had known each other for more
than two weeks, but we laughed and
talked together as if we had known each
other for years. Maybe college friends
truly are different from other friends.
Seeing each other so often, there is a
greater chance for experiences to occur
which provide memories for all in-
volved.

One such experience occurred dur-
ing a little one-on-one. Someone — |
think that it was me — was trying to
block a lay-up and got a little too close
to the hoop. My ensuing wild-arm-flail
— or block attempt in basketball terms
— snapped the rim from the wall and
stunned us all.

My neighbor was infinitely gra-
cious to me after my destructive act. He
again displayed equanimity when, while
in the process of trying to glue the rim
back together, I managed instead to
super-glue it to his wall.

infamy in our minds.
But this common-
ality of shared experience
seems toend when people
step through the class-

depending on how many reviews we
have the next day — has accelerated the
entire friendship process. I know my
Davidson friends in one month as well
as I knew my high school friends in
perhaps four. Sharing a variety of expe-
riences breeds a closeness and com-
monality with which the relative de-
tachment of high school cannot com-
pete.

A hallmate of mine has — or rather
had — a Nerf basketball hoop over his
door on which some of us would occa-
sionally shoot and play one-on-one. At

,You are like visiting scholars at-

other for only two or three hours a
week. In high school, the basis of
friendship was having classes with
people. While this is lost to some de-
gree in college, there are many other
arenas in which to cultivate friendship.

Hopefully I will be able to culti-
vate these friendships in the future with
aslightly less destructive undercurrent.
