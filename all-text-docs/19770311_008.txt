The Infirmary

THE INFIRMARY cries for new bedding as one of its needs.

The college Infirmary has
proven to offer poor and
inadequate health care to sev-
eral Davidson students, caus-
ing other students to hesitate
to use the available services.

The Davidsonian found the
inadequate services involve
primarily hasty and incom-
plete examinations by the
doctors, increasing the possi-
bility of incorrect diagnoses,
poor x-ray equipment and the
lack of transportation avail-
able for injured students to
use to reach hospitals in either
Huntersville or Charlotte.

Sally Stow had an injured
knee diagnosed as pulled liga-
ments by an infirmary doctor.
As he tried to inject cortisone
into the joint, blood came out
of the wound, forcing the
cortisone out.
“I asked about the blood
and he did not answer my
question and continued to
inject cortisone and taped my
leg,”’ Stow said. ‘‘He said to
come back if my knee locked.

About: five days later the
muscles in my leg atrophied
from disuse and my leg would
not bend. Thinking my leg had
locked, two of my friends
carried me down to the Infir-
mary where I spent the night
ion pain killers,” she said.

The following day the infir-
mary doctor referred Stow to
the hospital in Huntersville for
x-rays.

“I_had to find my own

transportation to Hunters-
ville, get the x-rays and then
bring them back to Davidson
for further consultation,” she
said. All this was to be done
with an atrophied leg.

Stow was then referred to a
Charlotte clinic, having to find
her own transportation there,
and diagnosed as having con-
genital defects in both knees
which caused the damage. She
spent the next six months
either on crutches or in braces.

The next summer she had.

her knee examined in Atlanta
and found that a small bone
fragment was lodged under
the kneecap, dislodging the
cap and causing tissue damage
to the joint.

“There was an evident prot-
rusion from under the knee cap
the entire time since the
accident,”’ she said. This pro-
trusion was the bone fragment
the doctors could not find.

Katherine Kafoglis also had
a broken bone mis-diagnosed
by the Infirmary and Hunters-
ville doctors.

She broke her elbow in a
fall, visited the Infirmary and
was told to find her own trans-
portation to Huntersville for
x-rays. The doctor who read

the x-ray, who also worked at —

the Infirmary, told her the
arm was not broken, and to
exercise the joint to bring
down the swelling. Two days
later she received a call from
the Infirmary, saying that the
x-ray had been read incorrect-
ly and that the elbow was

broken.

“The doctor at the Infirm-
ary put my arm into a sling
and told me to find a way into
Charlotte to go to the Miller
Clinic. The doctor there said
that if I had waited any longer
it would have probably set
wrong,’’ she said.

One cannot lay the entire
blame for mis-diagnosed
breaks on the infirmary doc-
tors, because the x-rays have
to be taken in Huntersville.
But mis-diagnosed illnesses
are another matter entirely.

Bill Barnes received inade-
quate care for an intestinal
infection, and was forced to go
to an emergency room at a
Charlotte hospital as a result.

When Barnes visited the
Infirmary, ““The doctor poked
around in my stomach and
made some tongue-in-cheek
remarks about appendicitis.
He told me I could discharge
myself in the’ morning any
time I wanted to,” he said.

Less than 24 hours after he
was discharged, Barnes had to

tudents spread horror stories

go to Charlotte for treatment.
‘It took the doctor there 20
minutes to diagnose it and
they cleared it up in two
hours, while I spent almost 24
hours in agony after visiting
the Infirmary,” he said.

These instances are only
examples of students’ com-
plaints with the Infirmary.
They are by no means the only
cases.

“‘We try very hard up
here—I don’t know whether
the students are too demand-
ing or what,’ said infirmary
doctor Kerecman when he was
shown the students’ com-
plaints.

“We're pushed for time, and
we certainly don’t have time to
spend a half an hour talking to
students about their problems
and all the psychological im-
plications,’’ he said.

This reporter waited 20
minutes to speak with Kerec-
man. During this time he saw
five different patients. Four-
minute health care is not what
any students wants or needs.

Of course this aspect only
represents half of Davidson’s
health care. The nurses re-
peatedly received glowing
compliments for their care.

This rapid service cannot be
blamed on the Infirmary al-
one; both the students and the
college administration help to
create it.

Many students visit the
facility regularly, even when
they have no serious illness,
taking time away from stu-

dents with valid complaints.
These students come for a
variety of reasons, but their
actions are selfish and poss-
ibly damaging to other stu-
dents.

The doctors are available for
only 1% hours a day now,
necessarily limiting their time
with patients. Davidson needs
the full-time doctors they plan

to hire in 1978 now.

Opini

Women desire more extensive care

Is the consciousness of Dav-
idson College finally being
raised to see and meet the
needs of women students? The
recent controversy over the
all-female eating house called
for new campus sensitivity to
the demands of women. But
other more basic considera-
tions in the area of women’s
health care and birth control
exist in ambiguous, ill-defined
terms where adequate consid-
eration for women’s needs are
not evident.

A look at the policy of the

college toward women’s health
care reveals that their stand
on gynecological care and
birth control remains noncom-
mittal and vague. The official
policy states that ‘“‘gynecolog-
ical care is provided; however,
students should consult a
gynecologist elsewhere for
routine examinations.”’

The actual policy of the. in-
firmary is presently dependent
on the doctor in charge, while
in the past the policy varied
from doctor to doctor.

Van Williamson pointed out
that in previous years you
could “go to doctor A and he

would not give a pelvic exam-
ination and go to doctor B and
he would prescribe the Pill.”
Dr. Ellithorpe, head of the
Infirmary recommends the Pill
saying that ‘‘as far as conven-
ience and efficiency and saf-
ety, the Pill is probably head
and shoulders with other birth
control methods.*’ Dr. Elli-

thorpe is not a qualified gyne-'

cologist and while he does
provide some services to wo-
men students he is not capable
of presenting the student with

the range of information and-

service of a professional.

ever, will not arrive until
September 1978, and with the
expiration of the Huntersville
clinic contract, Davidson will
be left for one year without an
infirmary doctor.

Terry is now looking for a
doctor at the stage between
internship and residency to fill
in. He feels the best place to
look for such a man would be
the Army. Davidson used an
Army doctor four years ago.

If an Army doctor cannot be
found Terry says the alterna-
tive will be a ‘‘patchwork job’.
Several doctors will be hired
throughout the year for short
periods of time.

He cites as an example a
Mooresville doctor who is
willing to do sick call for six
weeks. He knows of additional
interns from Charlotte who
might be willing to fill in other
time slots.

‘‘This system is really all
right,”’ Terry comments. ‘“We
can have someone work for
only two weeks because no

‘You don’t heed bifocals to
see that the peeds of other
college departments are being
met before ouys,”’ said Mrs.
Dorothy Sherrill, supervisor of
the Preyer Infirmary, often
listing severgl needs which
have gone neglected.

For over 4 decade, the
nurses have |pleaded with
Dean Terry tb have an ele-
vator installe, ‘‘We’ve had
students whojwere about to
faint that had ito stop and sit
down while climbing the
stairs. |

“Many studpnts just don’t
feel like walking up steps when
they come in|'’ commented
Mrs. Edith Christian, one of
the other threelregistered nur-
ses working injthe Infirmary.

Also, it is|tiring for the
nurses to incegsantly walk up
and down the stairs during
busy periods when most of the
thirteen bedsjon the second

a hundred trips per twelve-

” ola

one’s in the Jgfirmary for any
longer than tat.”

The new dpctors are only
needs to be
improved inthe Infirmary.
The building forms the most.
immediate proplem. As of now
Davidson plags to utilize the
present building for both the
college Infirmary and office
space for the Rew doctors.

The college} however, anti-
cipates problems with parking
and has not yet found a
solution. The} administration
does not feel if has the money
to invest in a hew building.

Besides a
Infirmary n
ter system,
mattresses, a Microscope, and
another examining room.
¥ the presently

be worked ou} Davidson can
take advantage of their facili-
ties.
