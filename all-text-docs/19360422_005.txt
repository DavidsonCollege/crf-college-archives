A.number of new books have been

drama, fiction, fine arts, and social

books on Japan.

The Art of Michelangelo, by H. H.
Powers, deals with the individual
works from the hand of that great ar-

itual fact of which these are the frag-
mentary and imperfect~expression:

King Jasper, by Edward Arling-
ton Robinson, is a poem, a medium
for expressing Robinson's own ideas
Yon this puzzling world. Never has
he written lines of greater beauty or
penetration. Over and over passages
occur, which one recognizes unmis-
takably as the essence of truth — fine,
honest, and absolute.

Ishimoto, and A Daughter of the
North, by Madame Sugimoto, are
true-to-life descriptions wom-
an’s life in Japan. One deals with the
life of an aristocrat, the other with
