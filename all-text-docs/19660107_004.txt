A FAIRY TALE...

Once, at a place not so very far from here in a
day not so very long ago, lived a white-legged,
scrawny, little kid, a 98-pound weakling, the son of
David Trusty—and, as his name escapes me now, |
shall refer to him as just that, David Trusty’s boy,
David's son.

A quiet, studious fellow, David's son spent his
days and nights pouring over the works of Chaucer,
Plato and Moses, and under the careful eye of his
parents he learned to worship two heroes, Woodrow
Wilson and Dean Rusk.

At times, however, when his parents were away
(usually at church, for they were very devout),
David’s son would venture outside the walls of his
huge white-columned brick mansion and walk down
the street protected only by his knowledge of the
classics, the Bible, sciences and higher mathematics.

Needless to say he was not very well protected.
For every time he ventured outside he would return
beaten to a pulp. covered with cuts,and bruises, with
sand kicked in his face and all the girls laughing at
him.

And then it happened—his parents caught our
downtrodden little hero as he crawled back home aft-
er one unusually bad beating by the neighborhood
bullies.

Shocked by what they saw, the Trustys got to-
gether and searched mail order catalogues until they
finally found what they needed. Within a few days
David’s‘son’s Charles Atlas kit arrived from Newport
News, COD.

Ah, how dilligently our hero worked. First he
built up the left side of his body and convinced this
was enough’ to protect him he ran outside and
straight away knocked-out one of the nation’s biggest
bullies. Unfortunately he needed a bit more work
on his right side because he was immediately
trounced on by a local bully from Catawba and
then six more as he struggled home to improve his
body a bit more.

Back in his work-out room he lifted. more
weights and sprouted new muscles and gained new
confidence.

Emerging with his new bod, David’s son be-
came a Robin Hood. Superman, Hercules, Lyndon
Johnson all rolled into one. He no longer hid behind
the thick brick of his white-columned home, but
ventured forth into the world. a chanipion of the op-
pressed. bashing the bullies that were lying in wait.
or him.

And the bullies fell, and the nation marveled at.
this paragon of virtue who proved his kindness once
a year in a senseless neighborhood free-for-all when
he’d let the fellows who used to trounce him bring
back old times by beating up on him again.

Perhaps we should end our story here. A happy
ending generally is in order for a fairy tale, but this
ending must be more grim and less Grimm.

Alas and alack, I cannot say our hero lived hap-
pily ever after or once he’d destroyed the biggest

ullies in his neighborhood, he moved farther from
home taking on bullies from anywhere, on any terms,
at any time.

Alas and alack, I cannot say the poor and op-
pressed became his fans and followers, ever marvel-
ling at his courage and bravery. For the nation
‘scoffed and forgot his early courage.

Instead of remembering his early courage and
thinking of him as the Cinderella, Robin Hood, and
knightly-type creature he’d started out as, the na-
tion pictured him more as the two step sisters, the
Sheriff of Nottingham, and the fire breathing drag-

on-type.

And forgetting his early courage, those he'd
charmed at first began picturing him as a bully as
bad as any he'd vanquished. No one would give him
credit for pummeling old ladies, beating up little
boys, and bouncing new born babies like basket-
balls being pounded into the shellac on the floor of
his fancy new house—a glass and cement, modern
Structure with a dome roof.

And instead of being praised as he’d been ear-
lier, David’s son was chastized by those who'd sung
his greatness in the past few years. Instead of a
young, strong boy, the flower of American youth,
David’s son was called a bully by the very people
he’d amazed with his early strength.

_ Perhaps he can regain his early popularity by
taking on some more bullies and boys more his own
size and age.

Or perhaps he will lose all his early popularity
completely. For I am told that even last week an-
other David (not our hero’s dad) was hurling a
rock into the eye of a Goliath. For another white-
legged, scrawny, little kid, a 98-pound weakling
rose out of the sea somewhere in Maryland and
stalked a new bully, striking him a death blow with-
in the very walls of his stately, shiny-floored man-
sion.

... WITH A MORAL

“l_ understand Lefty Driesell thinks it was a
fluke that we beat him at Charlotte. With the sched-
ule he’s got it ought to be an accident whenever
anybody beats him,” Wake Forest’s Jackie Murdock
told a group of sports writers last month in Win-
ston-Salem.

Perchance Murdock is right. But easy schedule
or not tomorrow night’s game with West Virginia
will not be easy.

Instead, it will be a chance for Driesell to show
the nation’s skeptics his ’Cats are capable of taking
on and beating top teams. It will be a chance for
Driesell to show the nation’s skeptics his ’Cats de-
serve a national ranking—and not the reputation
of a bully that goes around beating up little boys.

der and the Wildcats in tomorrow night’s 8p.m. clash at the Charlotte Coliseum.
Any defense that can hold North Carolina’s Bob Lewis to 12 points in a game

and thereby beat the Tarheels has to have something going for it. And Wildcat star

Snyder will probably get the chance to test it.

Leading the young Mountain-

Carl Head, a former junior col-
lege All-America and Most
Valuable Player .in the national
junior college tournament, pro-
vides another threat. Head is
perhaps somewhat ‘inconsistent,
and his play may greatly influ-

Others to see a good deal of

commented that West Virginia
has good depth and size, but
he emphasized their quickness.
“We're going to have to stop
Head and do a good job against
Williams to beat them,”’ com-
mented Holland. ‘“‘It’s sure go-

Looking a little weary from
Tuesday night's capers, Coach
Lefty Driesell recounted some
of the 98-89 victory over Rich-
mond.

“It was a tough contest
throughout." Going on he said,
“I was real pleased with the
outcome, and our overall hustle
was real good.”

The Spiders’ game strategy to
stop Snyder, fell apart in the
second half. In spite of the de-
fensive efforts of Terry Bur-
gess and Dick Balderson who
both fouled out, Snyder managed
to escape with 38 points and 22
rebounds, both game highs.

overlooked. While the. Spiders
fretted over Snyder, Knowles
and Lane were scoring 20 and
25 points respectively.

In Lane's 25 points were nine

he shot 100%. In fact he has

Moher, at 6-6, is good on the
boards and has a good jump
shot. Dave Muller is also a fine
outside shooter for 6-6 and is a
big scorer for The Citadel.

Doug Bridges, a sophomore
who. played well against last
year’s freshmen, and John De-
Brosse, another good ball-han-
dler, round out the starting
squad.

Were it not for a couple of
dropouts, the Bulldogs would
present even more of a threat.
They lost one man due to grades
and another for disciplinary rea-
sons. Both were expected to be
team leaders this year.

Holland stated. ‘We expect

to be tough from what we know
of them, We know they'll put
forth a, lot of hustle.”
