Several weeks have passed now since
the school was in arms about the dormi-
tory mess. The dorms have quieted. down,
—and..so. has the discussion — Jxcept—for
an occasional bottle-throwing spree by
some childish freshman in Watts, the
silence in the halls is wabroken.

A large part of the discussion about
the dormitories in general which this in-
cident stirred, up, dealt with the com-
plaints from freshman that noise kept
them from studying. Besides the fact
that freshman make most 61 the noise.
there is also the fact that some freshman
have lived through noise ia the dorms to
become Phi Betes. Noise is an excellent
excuse for not passitig. There's nothing
like a good tight down the hali to serve
as a reason tor “Ser gitang’ a drv as-
found by these who want to study. ~The
library, the ¥, fraternity houses. some
other dormitory. are only a few. Tt there
were not some noise, students might com-
plain that they could not keep awake,

Of the plans suggested tentatively to
remedy the whole situation of dormitory
trouble, that of placing a faculty guardian
in each dorm is too impractical to be con.
sidered. Davidson is not a prep school
(it says here in small print).

The other plan, of appointing student

dormitory leaders, is worth discussing. if -

some method of curbing: the unleashed
furySin «the halls must be found. If the
monitors were elected by the student body,
and not appointed, they might help pre-
serve quict. But it seems more likely to
believe that a race would start to see how
much damage one person could do without
getting caught.

If it is decided that some plan of dor-
mitory control is necessary, we plead with
the faculty to get the student. body to
pass on the method chosen. A rule taking
away any more student privileges without
the students’ consent will certainly prove
disastrous.

that casily have dances at Davidson been
made possible! But paving the way for
passage of this faculty recommendation
has been. far fromeasy. The struggle for
dancing on the campus has been far long-
er and more. bitter than many of us real-
ize. In fact we have heard one person
say-that -he knows alumni of Davidson
who will hardly believe this news when it

-We can understand something of the
“blood, sweat and tears’ poured out for
the cause of dancing at Davidson when
we learn that for the past twelve years
editors of the Davidsonian have been
pushing the pen in passionate appeal for
the measure which the trustees passed last
weck. But from the first headlined dance
article of February 3, 1932, until now.
the tone has been somewhat hopeless.
Now for the first time we can say with
complete contidence: ‘‘There WIL1. be
dances at Davidson!” .

Of course there is the proverbial red
tape. Complete arrangements cannot be
made overnight. But the matter is now
entirely up to the faculty, and that body
is almost unanimously in favor of dances
on the campus.

One professor has remarked that he
doesn't believe dances will be held here
on the campus for any great length of
time. Ile believes that the student body
will revel in the novelty of the situation
for a short time and then, realizing that
the City of Davidson is not the most glam-
orous spot in the world, will be ready to
move back to the greener pastures of
Charlotte. Perhaps he is right — only
time will tell. But for the present at
least we can rejoice freely in a great vic-
tory! - .

Now that the day is in sight when Da-
vidson will have her first dance on the
campus. we can predict that there will
‘probably be a tumult very much like that

weeping of lovers of the “good old days”
mingled .with the shouts of joy of those
who sense only a new glory. [ut the
gist of the comment on the part of the
present generation of Sons of Davidson
will doubtless be simply: “Come on chil-

Let’s Go, Cats....

The following letter was sent to Jim
Lowry by Capt. Sam Spencer, Davidson
graduate and for two years instructor in
the R. O. T. C. department here. - Capt.
Spencer is now stationed at N. C. State in
Raleigh. The game with Carolina re-
ferred to was the one in Charlotte which
Davidson lost by four points. We can
say nothing more to express our hopes
for the Wildcats in the tournament next
week.

“Dear Jim:

Your record on the court, both indavid-
ually and as a team has looked mighty
good so far, and | just want you to know
that you have a mighty interested support-
er up here. Even against Carolina the
showing was pretty good. but | hope you
won't be satished with it—if's time we got
rid of the ‘ntoral victory’ complex at Da-
vidson. Anyway, Pm backing you for
the dark horse in the tournament. My
best to all the boys. 7

Another Chapel program has got-

it took place the day before and
another the day before that. Five
days a week, week in and weck
out, we walk into Chapel and set-
tle down for another program _
and Mr. Screwtape smiles. °

When we lose sight of the pur-
pose behind these Chapel programs,
we are in danger of letting them

program is set aside for worship,
for praising God, and for reverent

Lately, a number of people have
become concerned about student-
faculty relations. With this in
mind, may I make a suggestion.
Why don't more hall prayer groups
invite faculty members in for the
Wednesday night nicetings? If this =
declining custom were revived, it

would give both sides a chance to
see each other outside the formalit—
of the classroom. It could be a
means of allowing students and pro-
iessors to really know each other
better, and that is a part of col-
lege too often missed. ;
