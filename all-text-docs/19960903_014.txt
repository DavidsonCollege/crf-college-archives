1996 has already been a tre-
mendous year for women’s sports
worldwide.

More women participated -
and won - in Atlanta than at any
previous Olympiad.

While Dream Team III
played dull, uninspired basket-
ball onits way to gold, the women
hoopsters proved to be the real
Dreamers, marching trium-
phantly to an emotional and con-
vincing championship victory
over Brazil.

The women’s soccer and
softball teams, both captured
golds in their sport’s first ever
Olympic appearances.

Track stars Gail Devers,
Gwen Torrence, and Jackie
Joyner-Kersee also found glory
in Atlanta.

And squeaky gymnast Kerri
| Strug gave the world perhaps the
Games’ most enduring image,
vaulting the Stars and Stripes onto
the top of the women’s gymnas-
tics medal stand for the first time
ever.

About four hours northeast,
call Davidson Atlanta II, as
women’s athletics are poised to
vaultto the forefront of this year’s
campus sports scene.

In yesterday’s Women’s
Sports column in the Observer,
the women’s soccer team was
highlighted as the favorite in the
Southern Conference coaches’
poll to claim its third straight
league tournament champion-
ship.

The Wildcats sport senior
leadership in tri-captains Kelly
Ammann, Lucia Plosser, and
Melissa Moser, a superhuman
goalie in Allison Noznesky and,
with the addition of a huge fresh-
men group, boast unprecedented
depth.

But they are not the only
Wildcat women to watch this
year.

The volleyball team, South-
ern Conference doormat in the
past, welcomed an impressive
rookie corps of its own this fall.

The youngsters played a big
role in this weekend’s Davidson
Invitational, as the volleyball
squad opened its season by win-
ning two of three matches.

And in a sky of optimism
surrounding Davidson women’s
sports, the women’s basketball
team is probably the single-
brightest star.

Last year, the Wildcats broke
out of the conference cellar in a
big way, posting a program-
record 14 wins and advancing to
the conference semifinals at the
Greensboro Coliseum.

The NCAA Newsrated them
the fifth most improved team in
the country and, with yet another
superlative recruiting class, this
year’s squad is nothing short of
spectacular. °

As is the outlook for
Davidson women’s sports in this,

The Year of the Female ‘Cat.

Men stun #6 Gamecocks in nightcap

Player of the game Phil Julien,
in a commercial break from his
postgame interview, looked over
at a sedate Charlie Slagle and asked
increduously, “Slagle, are you
happy?”

After a short pause, the head
coach cracked a smile and an-
swered, “That I am.”

He and 785 other Wildcat fans
at Richardson Field Sunday night
who saw Davidson shock sixth-
ranked South Carolina, 1-0, in the
biggest win for the men’s soccer
team since it advanced to the
NCAA Final Four in 1992, °

The victory erased any doubts
created by a disheartening 3-0 loss
at Wake Forest on Friday night, as
the Wildcats (1-1) did a complete
one-eighty, controllingymuch of
the play versus the touted Game-
cocks.

The Davidson defense was as
outstanding yesterday as it was
poor on Friday, holding the offen-
sively potent Gamecocks, who
averaged 17.5 shots a game last
season, to just nine shots.

Carolina superstar Clint
Mathis, the nation’s leading goal-
scorer last year with 25 tallies,
managed only one shot and ap-
peared frustrated all game.

_ The Wildcat offense, largely
ineffective at Wake Forest, was
impressive, blasting 12 shots on
goal. Most importantly though,
Julien beat Gamecock goalkeeper
John Mills on one of them.

“Isaac (Stewart) played a
quick ball to Keith (Kleeman) and
Keith played a great ball to me,”
said Julien of his game-winner in
the 23rd minute. “And I was able
to tuck it away. It felt great.”

“Phil was really tough out
there today,” said Slagle. We cre-
ated 12 shots, whichis great against
South Carolina. The entire front
line got their chances.”

Julien led the team with four
shots and defending Southern Con-
ference Player of the Year Robert
Clarke added three, but had easily
half-a-dozen legitimate scoring
opportunities. Freshman Hartwell
Roper had two, and- Coley
Dominiak and Kleeman each con-
tributed one. ‘

“The kids played really well,”
said Slagle. “We stepped it up
after a 3-O-loss. That’s not easy to

do.”

The biggest win since that
fabled tourney run of four years
ago, coach?

“Tt may be. (South Carolina)
is agreatteam. Idon’t think they’ ll
lose more than four games all year.”

No doubt about it, according
to Julien. “Yes. It’s is the biggest
win since the Final Four year. It’s
number six South Carolina. Big
game.

“We’re a good team and we

know that. But we needed to prove -

it.”
Especially after the dismal
season-opener against the 23rd-

ranked Demon Deacons, in which
Wake Forest took advantage of a
flat Davidson team, scoring all
three goals in the first half and
coasting to the easy victory, aveng-
ing a 3-1 loss to the Wildcats last
year.

Davidson did settle down to
play a respectable second frame,
but the Demon Deacons dominated
for the most part, outshooting the
Wildcats, 13-5.

So what made the drastic dif-
ference? :

“We played with heart,” said
midfielder Fernando Campos. “We
played like we wanted it.”

Women’s soccer beats South Carolina

Freshman collects game-winner in the final moments of thrilling opener

By WILL BRADSHAW

It was like something out of a
movie. Only seconds remaining in
her first college game, the score
knotted at one, Ginny Dye col-
lectéd a near perfect pass from
midfielder Linda Rothemund on
the right flank.

She cut the ball back, taking
the defender out of the play, and
knocked it over a diving Amanda
Sandling to clinch the Wildcats 2-
1 season-opening win over South
Carolina.

“I knew there wasn’t much
time left, and when I shot it my
eyes were so big. I was saying
please go in. And everything was
in slow motion. I saw it go over the
goalie’s hands. Oh, it was such a

" great feeling,” Dye said excitedly.

South Carolina had struck in
the fourth minute when Jennie
Ondo broke through the Davidson
defense, and beat goalkeeper

’ Allison Noznesky in a one-on-one

situation.

“I was impressed with our
composure. After that first goal we
really played hard and fought our
way back into the game,” coach
Kevin Hundley said. “We have a
lot of freshmen playing key posi-
tions. I could guess at the veterans,
but I didn’t know how the fresh-
men would react.”

And the freshmen came up
big. Kelly Rennick tied the score
when she headed an Amy Kanoff
corner kick past Sandling in the
46th minute. :

In addition, Amy Balsinger
stepped into the hole at sweeper
and played a solid game.

“She. (Balsinger). was out-
standing and played with poise and
composure. You don’t ask your
sweeper to make big plays, just all
the plays,” Hundley quipped.

Rennick, who played much of
the game at center midfield with
Rothemund, felt a sense of relief at
scoring her first collegiate goal.

“To be honest, the first goal

(that USC scored) was my fault
because I didn’t recover. I needed
to make it up, and I knew it was my
job to put a head on the ball if
Kanoff got it to the back half of the
goal,” she said. “TI did it, and it felt
great.”

But all of these heroics would
have, meant nothing without a few
‘spectacular saves from Noznesky.
Late in the first half, South Caro-
lina ripped a shot from the top of
the box that Noznesky was able to
tip over the crossbar.

“Allie (Noznesky) came up
big forus. Those saves are somean-
ingful because they’re the differ-
ence between being down 1-0 and
2-O at the half. There were acouple
times where they did what they
needed to do to score, and Allie
came up with the big play,”
Hundley said.

The other huge save came
moments before Dye’s game-win-
ner. South Carolina star Debbie
Smith made a run up the sideline,
leaving a perfect cross for Ondo

who one-touched the ball on goal.
Intextbook fashion, Noznesky fol-
lowed the pass across the goal-
mouth and dove back to her left to
snag the shot.

“Tt’s the same drill we’ ve done
in keeper warm-ups every single
day since pre-season. Cover my
backside, The credit goes more
towards the assistant coach (Debra
Biche) and the other keeper
(Chesley Garrett),” Noznesky said.

And while the excitementfrom
the dramatic win permeated the
field, the team was clearly focused
on something more.

“We need to take the intensity
from today’s game and practice
with it, play with it, sleep with it,
eat with it, and look ahead to
Clemson,” Noznesky added,

That game will be at Clemson
on Sept. 9, following a match-up
at Wofford on Saturday.

“We camea long way towards
being a team today, and we will
win if we play as a unit,” Hundley
said.
