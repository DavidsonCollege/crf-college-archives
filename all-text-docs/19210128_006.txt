DAVID M. GASTON DIES
AFTER LONG ILLNESS

Was Student Here During S.
A. T. C. and Succeeding

Spring.
DAVID M. GASTON.

On January 19th, David M. Gas-
ton, ex-'22, of Aberdeen, N. C.,
died in a sanatorium at Clifton
Springs, N. Y. He had not been
well since having an attack of in-
fluenza while at Davidson his
freshman year, and from that
time declined in health. For
many months he had been very
sick, and had fought with the
great amount of will power that
he possessed, to recover, but sick-
ness had gripped him tightly.

David entered Davidson in the
fall of 1918, and in a short time
was one of the best known new
men on the Hill. He was a shin-
ing light in scholarship, barely
missing the honor-roll his first
id term. His talent for music was
remarkable for he played the vio-

lin beautifully, had a splendid
voice and ably rendered service
in the church music. But it was
| in neither of these two qualities

that David really stood out. He:

was a prominent figure at all
| times in all Christian activities.

It was in the Christian Endeav-
| or, Bible classes and ;mid-week
d prayer services that he seemed to

_ pour his whole soul.

His health did not permit him
to return his second year and he
remained at-home hoping to re-
gain his strength .so as to re-
turn the following fall. But his
| condition showed no improvement
and the next spring he went to

Charlotte, where he remained un-
der treatment for several months.

He scemed to improve and re-
turned to his home last summer.
Near the first of last November
he had a set back and grew very
weak. He then went to Clifton
Springs at which place he died.

The writer knew him well and
has never known a more perfect
Christian character in every re-
spect. His great hosts of friends
here and elsewhere that he ‘is
known testify to his goodness. He
is survived by his father, Rev. V.
R. Gaston, ’92, mother, two sisters,
and a brother. Our deepest sym-
pathy goes out to these, his loved
ones, in their bereavement.

DAVIDSON ALUMNUS RANKS
HIGH AS BUSINESS MAN

Lawrence Shakleford Holt Has
Done Much for ing in
North Carolina.

Lawrence Stakelford Holt was born
in Alamance county, near Burlington,
N. C., May 17, 1851. He was the son of
Edwin M. and Emily Holt. He was
educated atDr.° Alexander Wilson’s
School at Melville, N. C., and at Horner
Military School then at Oxford, N. C.
After finishing his preparatory training
he entered Davidson College in the
fall of 1868.

Young Holt was anxious to get into
business and in 1868 went into a whole-
sale grocery concern in Charlotte. On
April 2, 1872 he was married to Miss
Margaret Locke Erwin of Burke county.
He was an organizer in 1874 and for
many years a director of the Commer-
cia National Bank, of Charlotte. In
1877 he received from his father one-
fifth interest in Alamance and Carolina
Cotton Mills and became actively
identified with the business. He built
in 1883 with his brother L. Banks, the
Belmont Cotton Mills of Burlington,
N. C.

With others, he purchased Altamo-
hock Cotton Mills in 1884 (now Holt,
Grant and Holt), The Lafayette (now
the Aurora) cotton mills and the Hia-
watha (now the Gun) cotton mills. He
was an incorporator and director of
Durham and Southern Railway Com-
pany, and an officer and member of

Camels

Check up all that

many corporations. Chief among these
is Lawrence S. Holt and Sons, of which
he is the senior member. But his great-
ness in the business world is due chiefly
to his far-seeing ideas to produce har-
mony between employer and employees.
He is said to be the first manufacturer
in the South, voluntarily to shorten the
hours of labor, which be did in 1886 and
again in 1902. His present address is

REMARKABLE INTEREST SHOWN
IN EU. SOCIETY.

Judges Decide That Movies Are Not
Detrimental.

The regular weekly meeting of the
Eumanean Literary Society held last
Saturday night was voted the best in
many weeks. Many times during the
debate the house was convulsed in
laughter; all fully enjoyed the discus-
,sion and it is hoped that the society
jean again have subjects on the same
order.

The question was, “Resolved, that
moving pictures are a menace to a com-
munity.” Those on the affirmative were
Messrs. King, Wildman, Luckie and
Jones, R. R. Their opponents were
Ogden, McCutchen, Jas, Toney and Cox.
E. E. Houghton was on for declamation
and Jas. McCaskill delivered an oration.

The debate was a regular “give and
take” on both sides. Frank Wildman’s
eloquent denunciation of the evils of
such pictures as “The Scarlet Woman,”
“The Virtuous Vamp,” and “Male and
Female,” was indeed uplifting; while
Ogden’s words on the good of Mack
Sennett’s Bathing Beauties were cer-
tainly exhilirating. The negative at-
tempted to prove that moving pictures
are not a menace to the morals of a

NY one of Camels many points of absolute superiority
makes them a delight to the most fastidious ciga-

community nor are they a detriment be-
cause they improve the historical
knowledge, literary taste and scientific
interests of people. The affirmative at-
tempted to show the detriment render-

ed to the morals of a community. The.

decision both of the judges and of the
house was in favor of the negative.
The ‘selection from Daniel Webster's
“Speech of a Prosecuting Attorney”
rendered by Houghton was delivered so
forcefully that it was without criticism.
Joe McCaskill in his oration suggest-
ed that hereafter there be at Davidson
a financial manager of student activities
as well as the regular student managers.

choice Turkish and choice Domestic tobaccos—a flavor as
distinctive and refreshing as it is appetizing —smooth
