tek THE DAVIDSONIAN’S 75TH Anniversary Issue x April 1989

The 1960's. What comes to
mind? Hippies? Vietnam? The
Beatles? Marches?

How about—freshmen
wearing beanies? Or Queenies
and Salem imports swarming
Belk and Richardson during
big weekends? Or keeping
alcohol in the locked trunks of
cars because it wasn’t allowed
anywhere else on campus?

How about—¢getting a date
for Homecoming through a
computer dating service? Or
being “campused” for the
weekend for misconduct?

At first glance, the
Davidson of the 60’s might
seem an alien place to you.

aroused by talk of the Betas,
the Sigma Chis, or the Pi
Kappa Phis. There were
twelve fraternities on the
Court in the days before self-
selection.

Rush chairmen were frus-
trated. In 1965, rush regula-
tions prohibited upperclass-
men from going into fresh-
man dorms or giving fresh-
men rides. They prevented
freshmen from going into the
frat houses until December.

The party climate was dif-
ferent; alcohol was not per-
mitted at any Davidson func-
tion—on or off campus. .

People hotly debated the
drinking issue. A poll done in
1962 showed that a majority
of the students drank regu-
larly. Interestingly, many
students, as well as staff
members, also felt that

tions. were repealed.

Students cheered when
chaperons were no longer _
required at off-campus parties
and when women were fi-
nally allowed in the dorms.

ROTC units drilled all over
campus, since participation
was involuntary until the end
of the decade.

On Sundays, professors
held open houses after the
mandatory vespers service.
Later, the administration re-
placed vespers with required
attendance at local churches.

Students protested the
Professor Religious Oath. To
obtain full professorship, fac-
ulty members had to declare
their Christian beliefs. Stu-
dent and faculty pressure led
to the demise of this rule in
the mid-1960s.
