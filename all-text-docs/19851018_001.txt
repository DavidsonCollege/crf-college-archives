Suspects charged in recent crimes

By NELLE McCORKLE
Dean of Students Will Terry
wrote and sent notices to students
in on-campus housing last Friday
concerning two recent campus
crimes.

Terry said both incidents oc-
curred on campus in different
dorms. “Security was on the ball
in both cases,” he said.

The first incident involved an
18-year old male entering a
female student’s room in the early
morning of September 22. David-
son Town Police Captain Jack
Warlick said Lonnie Lee Cor-
nelius, an 18-year old Davidson
resident, is charged with first-de-
gree sexual offense and first-de-

gree burglary in the incident.

Davidson Police apprehended
Cornelius, who was held in the
Mecklenburg county jail. Cor-
nelius is currently out on bail
awaiting trial in superior court.

Also charged with first-degree
burglary in the incident is a 15-
year old black male.

According to Terry, the sec-
ond crime mentioned in his notice
was “a theft in a women’s dorm at
two o’clock in the morming.”
Committed during the week of
September 30, no suspect has
been charged in the case.

Following the two crimes,
Terry said his plan for campus se-
curity is “to continue to urge stu-

dents to lock their doors — they
are just sitting ducks.” He said,
“We are trying to get locks” on the
outside doors of Akers, Irwin and
Knox dormitories.

“IT think the time has come
when we’re going to have to go to
[a locked-door system],” Terry
said. He added that he does not
plan to increase campus security
patrolling.

Rick Moore of the Davidson
College police force defined first-
degree sexual offense, one of the
charges in the first incident, as a
felony involving engagement in a
sexual act other than intercourse
with a person other than the defen-
dant’s legal spouse by force

against that person’s will; the as-
sailant must also have used or dis-
played a dangerous weapon, in-
flicted serious personal injury on
another person, or have been
aided and abetted by one or more
other persons (in the college inci-
dent, Moore said the defendant is
charged with the latter).

Moore defined first-degree
burglary as breaking and entering,
without consent, the dwelling or
sleeping apartment of another per-
son while it is actually occupied at
night with the intent to commit
any felony or larceny.

Terry’s notice to students, ti-

tled “For Your Information,”
read:

Two incidents have oc-
curred recently, once again in-
dicating the need for women to
be careful about their safety.
Both of the incidents involved
a non-college person entering a
room late at night (early in the
morning). One of the incidents
is being prosecuted. It is not
possible to prosecute the sec-
ond one due to the inability to
identify the intruder.

It is essential that students
lock their rooms at night and

report any stranger seen on a
hall.

Convocation features inauguration of Dean Rusk program

By DAVID WILLIAMS

Former Secretary of State
Dean Rusk ’31 will appear at Fall
Convocation this Thursday for the
Inauguration of the Dean Rusk
Progxam in International Studies.
To-complement the international
focus of the Convocation, the
Davidson-Wurzburg agreement
will be formally recognized.

“It’s a rather. historic occae~-

sion,” said Jack Perry, Director of
the Dean Rusk Program. “Mr.

Rusk is a figure of major historical
importance. This is the first
chance that the present generation
of Davidson students can meet
him. I think it would be a shame to
miss this opportunity because Mr.
Rusk has thought more deeply of
the great issues of war and peace
in our time than anyone else I am
aware of.”

Assistant to the President Rick
Love said: ““The Convocation is a
chance for us to come together and
say that finally we’re beginning to
tangibly accomplish the things
we’ ve worked for. The Dean Rusk
program has been in the planning
and fundraising stages for a long
time. We have a very competent
and well-respected director, and
we have inspiration from the indi-
vidual for whom the program was
named.”

President Theodor Bercham
and Chancellor Reinhard Paul
Gunther of Julius-Maximilian’s
University of Wurzburg, Ger-
many will appear at the Convoca-
tion. President Kuykendall will
award Berchem and Gunther with
honorary degrees.

Former Secretary of State Dean Rusk 31.

Davidson’s JYA program in
Germany will move to Julius-
Maximilian’s University begin-
ning in the 1986-87 year. The
ceremonial signing of the agree-
ment for educational exchange be-
tween Davidson College and
Julius Maximilian’s University
will be held at 9:30 a.m. in the
Baxter Davidson Room in Cham-
bers next Thursday prior to the
Convocation.

In 1931, Rusk was graduated
Phi Beta Kappa and named David-
son’s sixth Rhodes Scholar. He
received B.S. and M.A. degrees
from St. John’s College, Oxford,
where he also received the Cecil
Peace Prize in 1933. He studied at
the University of Berlin and the
University of California Law
School.

Analyzing his role in the Viet-
nam war, Rusk stated: ‘There is

nothing I can say now which
would diminish in any way the
events of those years. My generat-
ion of students . . . came out of
[World War II] thinking that col-
lective security was the key to the
prevention of World War III. We
should understand why there
might be erosion of collective se-
curity among the American
people. We’ve put up 90 percent
of the non-Korean forces in
Korea, and 80 percent of the non-
Vietnamese forces in Vietnam. So
if my cousins here in Georgia
were to say to me, ‘Look, if col-
lective security means 50,000
dead every ten years, and it’s not
even collective, maybe it’s not a
good idea,’ I have profound re-
spect for that reaction. But that
still leaves these young people
with the question, ‘If not collec-
tive security, how do we propose

College Relations

to prevent World War III?’
Concerning the possibility of a
future global nuclear war, Rusk
added: “If we simply drift back
into that combination of pacifism,
isolation, and indifference, which
led my generation of students into
the catastrophe of World War II,
then I have very serious concerns
about the future. We have to think

~ hard about that question and this

new generation must find its own
answer, because this time there’s
a difference. Think-tanks, some
politicians, some media people,
and some professors string all
sorts of words together to create
the most alarming and horrible
scenario, but I myself do not see a
single situation in the real world
that is pointing toward nuclear
war.”

He added: “Now in a democ-
racy, it’s the private citizen who

. occupies the loftiest position
in our constitutional system. Each
one of us must accept our own
possibilities. We have no choice
but to try [to solve our world prob-
lems]. Otherwise, we dig a fox
hole and lay in there. We need to
think about what it means to be a
human being, or as others have

put it, ‘a child of God.’”
Dean Rusk was born in
Cherokee County, Georgia in

1909. He graduated from Boys
High School, Atlanta, in 1925. He
worked for a lawyer for two years
before enrolling at Davidson. At
Davidson, Rusk was freshman
class president, manager of the
Student Store, president of the
YMCA, and commander of the

ROTC Battalion, reaching the
rank of Cadet Lt. Colonel.

Rusk taught at Mills College
in California from 1934-1940 and
was appointed dean of faculty in
1938. In 1940 he was called to ac-
tive duty in the U.S. Army and
eventually rose to the rank of Col-

onel. He was deputy chief of staff
in the China-Burma-india Theater

and was awarded the Legion of
Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster.

Rusk began his State Depart-
ment career in 1946 as assistant
chief of the Division of Interna-
tional Security Affairs. He served
in a variety of positions culminat-
ing in his appointment as Assis-
tant Secretary of State for Far
Eastern Affairs in 1950. From
1952-1961 Rusk served as Presi-
dent of the Rockefeller Founda-
tion.

In 1960 President-elect John
F. Kennedy appointed Rusk Sec-
retary of State. Rusk served for
eight years under Presidents Ken-
nedy and Lyndon Johnson. “It's
quite a thing for this country to let
a barefoot, freckle-faced boy from
Cherokee County serve as its Sec-
retary of State, and so you have to
be respectful of a country that
even lets that happen,” Rusk said
in arecent interview for the South-
em Center for International
Studies.

Since 1970, Rusk has served
as Professor of international law at
the University of Georgia in
Athens. He has remained active
with Davidson College, serving as
trustee and honorary chairman of
the Davidson 1987 program.
