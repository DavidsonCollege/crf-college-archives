PERFECT GAME

Slade hit Mike Kelly for a 23
yard scoring strike to put
Davidson on the board.

The turning point of the
game came in the third
quarter during East Caroli-
na’s first possession. Ken
Hill had climaxed a David-
son scoring drive with a two
yard plunge to cut the mar-
gin to 13 points. East Caroli
na tried one of their infre-
quent passes and linebacker
Chris Giles made the inter
ception which precipitated
the rout.

Once again the key to the
victory was the Davidson
aerial attack as Slade hit on

Wofford (6-2) dropped their
two opening games but have
come on strong since with
35 points being their lowest
point total in their six game
streak. Included in their
streak are a 61-9 thrashing
of Emory and Henry and a
19-7 win over Furman.

Smith said of the Terriers,
We've never faced a Wof
ford team that didn’t have

a great quarterback and this
year is no exception.” ;

Smith has warned that any

trip to Boston is the long-
est that the sailing team has
made and the travel expen-
ses used up a large share of
the teams fall budget. The
Davidson team was compos-
ed of Dan Johnston, Lewis
Riley, Allen Lundy = and
James Hunter.

Johnston, one of the skip-
pers, called the regatta ‘‘the
most exciting’’ that Davidson
has. sailed in. He also term-
ed the’ competition ‘by far
the best we have ever met.”

The team was stopped on
the road Saturday night by
several police cruisers. The
members of the team fit the
description given by the vic-
tim of a robbery at gunpoint.
The team was detained un-

til positive identification
could be made. They were
released with many apolo-

gies from the officers.

The next competition on
the docket of the team is the
Fall Championships of the
South Atlantic Intercollegiate
Sailing Association which are
scheduled for Nov. 22 and 23
at Clemson University. Once
again the chief competition
is expected to be the team
from The Citadel.

Davidson's’ chances are
bright as a result of
their previous performances
against the Bulldogs this
fall. The champion of the
event wins the right. to re-

present the South Atlantic
I. S. A. in the national cham-
pionships which are schedul-
ed for late December in New
