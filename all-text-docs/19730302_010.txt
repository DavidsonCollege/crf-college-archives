The

Frank Has

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE

A powerhouse.

That phrase may be an un-
derstatement in describing the
tennis team at Davidson for
1973.

Head Coach Jeff Frank,
working as an intern this season
after the sudden death of Harry
Fogleman, is really excited

about the team's chances this
year.

“‘We are really strong in all
the positions,”’ the 28-year old
Davidson graduate conceeded.
“I think we have a good chance
to win the conference."’

Frank's optimism is by no
means unwarrented.

Returning from last year's
squad is David Weaver, the
number one singles champion

PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT
Kevin Menton brushes up on his backhand.

Benton, Webster Finish
Cat Wrestling Careers

By JACK LINARD
Staff Writer

Rob Benton finished out his
Davidson wrestling career last
Saturday with a fourth place
finish in the Southern Con-
ference Tournament at William
and Mary. Two others, Randy
Webster and Bill Garrett, also
finished their careers in the
tourney.

Benton had a very tough
draw, for he had to wrestle the
tourney favorite from East
Carolina. Benton lost his match,
thereby ending his winning
streak at eight.

In his second match, Benton
came back to defeat the 132
pounder from VMI for the
second time this year.

In the consolation match to
determine third place, Benton
ran up against a tough wrestler
from Appalachian State and
suffered his second loss. This
loss dropped him into fourth
place in the standings.

Randy Webster was on his
way to a possible consolation
match and third place, but a
dislocated kneecap forced him
to forfeit the match.

At the time of his forfeit he
was in the lead of a very close

seven individual champions and
113 points.

William and Mary had the
other three individual cham-
pions and took second place
overall.

Davidson finished last in the
seven team tournament with 4
and one half points, only 1 point
behind Furman’s fifth place
finish.

While Davidson will certainly
miss its four seniors, including
co-captain Rusty Winchester
who was injured last week.
Parker noted that there are
some old and new prospects

in the SC Tournament.

The 6-0 senior is being pushed
hard by Kevin Menton, an ex-
change student from Ireland.

‘Both these boys are really
playing well,"’ praised Frank.
‘They will really be giving each
other a fit for the number one

Frank predicted that it would
be interesting to see how the
two play against each other as
the season progresses.

“They play opposite styles of
tennis," Frank explained.
‘“‘Weaver has_ tremendous
power. He likes to play the hard
volley and put the game away
with quick shots.

“On the other hand, Menton
plays a more consistent and
slowly paced game. He plays at
the baseline and uses soft lobs
and easy placement shots. He
just waits it out."

Frank went on to say he
thought it would be especially
interesting to see how Weaver
will try to beat Menton, who
playsa very smart game.

“I think it will be good for
both of them,” said Frank.

Frank was also pleased with
the play of Bill Allen, who is
returning after finishing second
in the nuumber two singles in
the tourney last year.

Frank said he thought Allen
“had really developed good
rhythm and timing. He has also
got his confidence up to a good
peak.

Maarten Ruys is the other
foreign player on the team. He
is a native of Holland.

‘“‘Ruys is young (17 years old)
and is not used to playing out-
side the junior leagues yet."’ ex-
plained Frank.

‘‘But he is strong, quick, has
cat-like moves, and shows
streaks of sheer brilliance on
the court.”

“Once he adapts to playing
the adult game, everyone else
will just have to stand back and
watch,” said Frank.

These four pretty much have
the top four seeds locked up at
this point, with the opening
match on Monday against Pur-
due at Davidson.

The last two seeds are a toss-
up between senior Hay
Lankenau, juniors § Gary
Bressler and Jim Dorsett, and

sophomore Rick Quinby.

Bressler returns after win-
ning the number five seed in
the conference last year.

About the general condtion of
the team, Frank commented
that he thought they were in ex-
cellent physical shape as well
as playing condition.

He attributed this to the fact
that the weather has been nice
enough for the team to have
logged many hours on the
courts.

‘*We have not been on the clay
yet, but we hope to get there
soon," he said. ‘‘The northern
schools have only been inside on
the hard courts and we ought to
have a home court advantage
on the clay."

The attitude of the team is
‘“‘Super-positive,"’ according to
Frank.

“The guys are really up men-
tally and ready to work and
play hard,’ he commented.

The schedule !ooms_ un-
mercifully in front of the Wiid-
cats for this season.

High Hopes For ’73 Netters

Of 29 matches, the Cats play
20 at home, including a good
many Northern teams who have
agreed to play for a night's
lodging on their way to a
Florida swing.

“We are lucky to get so
many matches with a lot of good
teams,” Frank said.

Included in the schedule will
be tough road games at Duke,
N. C. State and UNC, which is
one of the top five teams in the
country.

“It will really be a test of our
quality when we go to Chapel
Hill and meet the Tar Heels,”
Frank smiled. ‘It will be in-
teresting to see how our boys
perform."

Other tough matches will in-
clude Furman, Harvard, and
Penn.

“I think we have got great
potential for this season,”’ con-
cluded Frank. ‘‘With Weaver
returning as champ in the num-
ber one singles and Menton
pushing him for that slot, we
cannot help but be optimistic."
