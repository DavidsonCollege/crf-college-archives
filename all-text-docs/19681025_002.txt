HHH For President

You’ve got four choices Nov. 5:
Humphrey, Nixon, Wallace or stay
home. The first is the best.

Our endorsement of Hubert Hum-
phrey for President is not a qualified,
“yes... but” kind of a thing. We back
the man 100 per cent.

Perhaps it wotild be fashionable at
this point to proceed to hack the can-
didate up a bit for his shortcomings.
That’s what the New Left has been
doing.

Yes, the man does have his faults.
He has unfortunately lingered too long
in the shadow of Lyndon Johnson, and
some of the blood from a stupid war
is, by association, on his hands.

But look at his opponents~—and

their faults. Next to Nixon and Wal-
lace, on just about any issue, Hum-
phrey looks like an angel.
. Some “new” liberals may be dis-
pleased at the moment, but they for-
get that Humphrey was a gut liberal
before it was popular to be one.

His record he can stand on with
pride. He’s been fighting for civil
rights and human dignity for years.
Medicare, open housing, poverty pro-
grams, federal aid to education—he
has championed these and more.

He’s got the experience to back him
up—poor-boy-made-good to mayor. of

Minneapolis, Senate leader, vice presi-
dent and party kingpin.

And the man can stand on his char-
acter. His critics say he tries to be all
things to all people—and they’re right.
His exuberance is no put-on; the Poli-
tics of Joy is for real. Rarely has a
man so thoroughly sincere and decent
sought the Presidency.

This year it is imperative that
America affirm reason and progress.
Without them we sink to bigotry and
suspicion and frustration. Hubert
Humphrey is the great affirmation.

That Agnew

Relax. That muffled gagging noise
you heard earlier this week was only
Spiro T. Agnew putting his foot into
his mouth again.

You must be used to it by now.
Agnew’s been doing it for weeks.

This time it was during an inter-
view, and a reporter asked Spiro why
he hadn’t spent more time campaign-
ing in the slums.

Simple, said he. “If you’ve seen
one city slum, you’ve seen them all.”

What was that about Richard
Nixon’s ability to judge men?

New Kind Of Catalogue

If Davidson officials want to think

seriously about coeducation, they have
at least partial first-hand evidence
_ right under their noses. All they have
to do is visit some of the Free Univer-
sity classes on Tuesday night.
’ This rather recent innovation in
Davidson education seems to have
caught hold like a thirsty leech, at
least if we compare it with the usual
reaction to educational innovations at
Davidson. The fact is that many stu-
dents, both at Davidson and at Queens,
had to be turned down for admission
owing to lack of room.

For a newspaper which usually
takes a rather skeptical view of stu-
dent government, we must admit that
this time they have come up with
something really worthwhile. Rich
Cowart and his cohorts have done a
good job of organizing and financing
the program and deserve a lot of
credit.

Trite as it may seem by now, the
idea of getting an education in a
subject purely for the sake of interest
is tremendous. All too many David-
son students sign up for courses
simply because they have to fill their
schedules with something. After look-

ing at the Free University catalogue,
we wonder if students ought not to
pick more courses from this cata-
logue.

Perhaps the motivation of Queens
students is a bit more questionable.
But we would be the last to criticize
the addition of almost 100 girls to the
Davidson campus, even if it's only one
night a week. After all, it may give
Davidson students a better idea of
what it would be like to attend a co-
educational institution.

The university’ also promotes a
closer and more casual relationship
between students and professors, by
allowing them to relate on a topic of
avowed interest to both. No longer
will students just be trying to get
brownie points by associating with
professors.

In some cases, such as the poverty
seminar, the group may progress to-
ward solving a few problems. In
other cases, the course may only pro-
mote a little understanding. And, Lord
knows, if there’s anything we need
more of, it’s people who are interested
in solving problems and promoting
understanding.

Mid-Morning Snooze

Chapel is four yawns and a long
snooze.

Whatever the rationale behind
compulsory chapel was in the begin-
ning, it’s gone now. The program’s
value is just about nil, and any stu-
dent—if you’ can wake him up—will
tell you so.

Admittedly, we can see the virtue
of having the student body together
for a student body meeting or an ODK
or Who’s Nothing tapping. If we strain,
we can even half-way convince our-
selves that it’s good to be able to pro-
vide a sizable audience for a Reynolds

Lecturer or other important campus -

visitors.

But what speaker enjoys looking at
drooping eye ds and open newspapers
and speaking over whispers, snores
and es? It’s gotten to the point
now that no matter who the speaker
is, half the audience is tuned out be-
fore the introduction is over.

The trouble starts with the chapel
programs themselves: ‘most of them
are incredibly dull. Sometimes some-
body good like Terry Sanford or Bill
Sands slips in, as if unbeknownst to
the planners, but that’s rare. Most of
the time we are forced to listen to
the likes of that woman professor last
week, who was interesting only when
she crossed her legs, and those Tar
Heel political hacks the Young Repub-
licans were fond of sponsoring two
years ago.

In defense of the college chaplain,
who arranges most of the programs,
he has tried his best; the fact is, we

simply can’t get good people here on -

a regular bas

This year's new scheme—reducing
the number of total chapels in order
to have more money to attract really

‘ood speakers—isn’t working. We may
fave more money to spend, but chapel

has stayed about the same.

Actually, chapel’s main reason for
existence is gone now, for the col-
lege is now officially calling it ‘“as-
sembly” rather than “chapel,” appar-
ently giving up on the notion that the
program is religion oriented.

Chapel got started as a manifesta-.

tion of Davidson's religious commit-
ment, and when the trustees abandon-
ed vespers three years ago, they made
it plain they wanted chapel juiced up
as a measure of compensation. But
that hasn’t been done—it is probably
impossible anyway—and we are left
with an empty shell.

If we have to retain the compulsory
nature of the program, one of two
things should be done: increase the

uality of the programs, or reduce

e@ number.

Otherwise, if chapel deteriorates
much further, the whole student body
may sleep through 11 o’clock class
some day.

Them Too

Davidson has been upstaged by the
Boy Scouts.

Last week Baden Powell’s courteous,

-cheerful, brave legions—certainly the

last best refuge for rags and tags and
puppy-dog tails—saw the light and
went coed.

Naturally the move was not made
without some reservations on the part
of national leaders, and initially at
Teast the change will apply only at the
Explorer Scout level. But you can’t
beat their logic.

“We have known all along that
boys were interested in girls,” they

Your turn, Davidson.

Negro Student
Supports Reid

To The Editor:

Surprisingly, I find myself
in complete agreement with
Bob Reid and Messrs. La-
Plante, Fuller and Fergusooa.

First, let's examine Reid’s
logic. It is very sound be-
cause it points out one of the
basic faults of the white
liberal. For too long, whites
have felt a deep guilt about
the black man without caring
about his white brothers.

In the name of brotherhood,
whites have tried to force
integration upon the black
man when what was really
needed was equality of
all men—black and white.

The funny thing about it is
that the poor white has been
tricked into believing that his
lot is different from that of
the blacks when really it is
worse. The white upper class
has too long ignored the real
needs of all the people.

George Wallace may re-
veal that there is a large seg-
ment of the population that
hasn’t been touched by the
progress of the past few
years. In that sense, he and
-Stokley Carmichael are soul
brothers.

What white liberals must
make sure of is that the Wal-
lace people and the blacks
don't one day get together
and ‘attack the ruling class.
When that happens, it may
be all over for the false and
unequal society in which we
live.

Now for the ‘Dixie’’ prob-
lem. Why not play “‘Dixie’’ at
Davidson games? Does not
this song reflect the spirit of
the old South for which Jef-
ferson Davis, Huey Long. and
even George Wallace fought
so long?

Is not this song the
epitome of everything David-
son stands for? This school is
an excellent replica of that
long and honored past of
shame, brutality and hatred.

Let’s not be hypocritical.

When 0.6 per cent of the stu-
dent body is black and when
conservatism and _ tradition
predominate, there can be no
mistaking the real spirit of a
college.

When so insignificant an act
as trying to integrate a bar-
ber shop causes an uproar or
when the black community
is so alien to the students
that a series about it has to
appear in THE DAVIDSON.
IAN, things are pretty bad.

So why not play “Dixie.”
It typifies everything else
around here so well.

"JUST MOVIN’ IN A FEW BEDS FOR CHAPEL’

ROTC Once Again Target
Of Heavy Student Assault

To The Editor:

There has __ traditionally
been a lot of griping about
ROTC at Davidson, and most
of it has centered around the
bother and the dubious value
of the ‘‘course.” However,
except for a few vague ques-
tions about the compatibility
of ROTC with Davidson's
avowed purpose of providing
a liberal arts education,. no
one really seems to chal-
lenge the program on a moral
basis. It is easy to consider
ROTC at Davidson as either
an inconvenience or as ‘‘gvod
deals” for sliding through
your two years of patriotic
duty in a safe, comfortable
commission.

It is rather hard to see the
morals involved in marching
around and around = and
around on a drill field Tues-
day afternoons. Nevertheless,
as a participant of ROTC a

Cox Flouts War;
Drive Needs Aid

To The Editor:

In the beginning God creat-
ed the heaven, the earth and
man, who promptly set out
to destroy all three creations
through an activity for which
there are several names, the
most common of which is
war. War might be defined
as cultural advancement bv
means other than nonviolent
ones, but that doesn't really
say anything. Human pro-
gress might be measured fn
terms of how man has be-
come more proficient at kill-
ing. Outlined below is an at-
tempt at such a measure-
ment according to this defini-
tion.

Stage 1: One killed one’s
fellow man by striking him
with a sufficiently heavy.
blunt object: One's motiva-
tion was simple: either the
fellow man had something
one wanted, such as a female
of the species, or it was a
fun, exciting way to structure
one’s free time.

Stage 2: One killed by pro-
jecting a sharp missile into
his fellow man's body, or the
less refined version, by man-
ually entering a modified
sharp missile into his gastro-
intestinal tract. The motiva-
tion remained the same how-
ever,

Stage 3: Later one elimin-
ated his fellow man by the
projection of a small, blunted
missile into the victim's body.
This usually led to much.
bleeding (a waste of good
blood) and to a permanent
loss of consciousness on the
victim’s part.

Stage 4: All of the old-fash-
joned ways of killing are still
around and fitfully used, but
the fashionable thing now is
to vaporize thy fellow man
en masse. This is the thing.
It cannot be beat for ef-
ficiency and neatness.

Sometimes men are not con-
cerned with neatness in which
case they pollute the air
around the victim with nasty
littie gamma, alpha, and
beta particles which if one
is awfully unlucky can make
a completely new man out of
the victim. Motivation on
the individual level the read-
er is quite familiar with now,
but on a national level it's

called defending the peace, .

of which there will be a lot
after several nations have de-

fended themselves right out
of existence.

To The Editor:

Last spring in an effort to
attract more Negro appli-
cants to Davidson, we and
many other students organ-
ized a Negro scholarship
fund drive and collected two
thousand dollars from the
student body as the first
scholarship in the fund.

We were operating then on
the basis of information given
to us’ by the director of
admissions that the lack of
Negro students at Davidson
was due to a lack of quali-
fied Negro applicants.

This year we see our pro-
gram in terms of two main
goals: (1) To find a’ quali.

accept the scholarship for
the academic year 1969-1970:
and (2) to continue the fund

ed foundations and friends of
the college with the ultimate
goal of establishing a five
year scholarship program.

To accomplish our first
goal we are initiating an in-
tensive high school recruiting
program. We have visited
two predominantly Negro
high schonls in the Charlotte
area, met with their guid-
ance counselors, and made
plans to meet with some of
their students.

Next Thursday we will
meet with a representative
from the National -Scholar-
ship Service and Funds for
Negro Students to obtain
from him a list of gifted
Negro students from all over
the country, to discuss with
him our scholarship and to
have him = _ advertise it in
NSSFNS materials.

successful must continue to

now this support must take

and no mention of ROTC ap-

cation and all other major
areas of campus life are men-

of that section was embarass-

haps the College is as embar-

The following statement is

tion of the Baylor University
College of Medicine entitled
‘Education of the Physician.”

ROTC IN COLLEGE

**Because of the obligations
incurred in such service, the
prospective medical student
is advised to avoid affiliation
with a voluntary ROTC pro-
gram during his undergrad-
vate college years.”

Since approximately 20 per
cent of the student. body will
fall into the category of
“prospective medical  stu-
dent,”’ it-seems only fair that
some provision be made to
insure a choice in this matter
on the part of each student.

To The Editor:

It seems that a new require-
ment for graduation has been
put into effect at Davidson.

Now the student is required
not only to take ROTC but
also to conform to the Army's
ideas on personal grooming
habits, despite the fact that
he isn't even. in the Army.

Last Tuesday I reluctantly
marched myself out to the
soccer field and found that
my rather longish hair was
not to be tolerated. It ap-
pears that without an “ade-
quate’? haircut I will flunk

A direct result of this is
that the college will not allow

me to graduate. Nowhere in
the Cadet SOP does it say
that a student will be failed
for refusing to cut his hair.
It does say that unless he
does cut it he will be given
demerits and thus make it
hard for him to pass, but it
doesn't say that he will be
flunked.

Tam not in the Army: I am
enrolled (against my will) in
a college course, and I don’t
see that one certain course
should be allowed to require
anything more of the student
than does any other course,
and no other course requires
a neat haircut to pass.

I am not at this time pro.
testing the presence of the
military on campus or even
the fact that it is compulsory,
although these . questions
should be looked into.

The issue here is whether
or not an “inadequate’’ hair-
cut alone is grounds for fail-
ing a student.

So it seems that if the-
ROTC’'s present policy is up-
held I have a great number
of choises. It’s either get a
haircut, grin and bear it or
fail ROTC and not be allowed
to graduate.

_ For that amount, the admission charge at the Fox

you’ve been.

Last weekend the bill of fare at

the Fox was “The Wife Swappers”
and “Honey.” In brief, both were

godawful cinema.

“The Wife Swappers” is a docu-
mentary sort of film. No dialogue,
but a narrator supplies all the info,

introduces the members of a wife-

swapping club and throughout the
film makes as many suggestive and
double entendre comments as pos-

sible.

There is no plot. Rather, a single

“The Wife Swappers,” the
Wives are swapped; the

camera swings from bedroom to bedroom; the hostess

for the party “sees that her

guests have a good time”

by stripping to her brief, brief briefs and then by
dancing suggestively around her living room.

The film ends up with the murder of a drunken
guest who attacks one of the wives, against her wishes
of course, so she stabs him with a pair of scissors. The
moral of the film: it was fun while it lasted.

In “Honey” the audience gets a look at a pervert-

ed manage a trois: lesbian, good

girl and lover. The

lesbian, a carnival stripper, is attracted to Honey, the

You can see flicks that show just i
