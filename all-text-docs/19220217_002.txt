Court Gossip

Anyone reading in the Charlotte Ob-
server the account of the Davidson-Trin-
ity game would have been unable to
tell which one won the game. Head-
lines proclaimed that Davidson had de-
feated a crippled quintet, and the write-
up beneath went on to tell what a won-
derful team Trinity has. Davidson does
not give alibis for lost games. Davidson
profits by and forgets them, and all eri-
ergies are centered on the coming con-
tests. Moreover, statements made in
the write-up conflict with each other
and also with the story the score book
tells, and, while not squealing about any
defeats or near-defeats, Davidson does
ask for a square deal and a- decent
write-up of her games, win or lose.

There is no desire here that the ac-
counts of the games favor Davidson un-
less circumstances are such that it
should do so in order to give a true ac-
count of the game.

It has been also understood that
ethics in journalism and sport writing
require a non-partisan and true account
of all events. ;

WAKE FOREST. |
Davidson, after defeating State pn |

her own floor, the next night duplicated |
the performance by trimming Wake}
Forest at Wake Forest. The score was
20-27, the two point margin being ob-|
tained by superior work from the foul |
line. Both teams were evenly matched |
and at the end of the first half the score
stood 12-11 in’ favor of the “Red and
Black Machine.” During most of the
game Davidson was able to maintain a
short lead. In the middle of the second
half Wake Forest shot into the lead by
a margin of seven points but stellar work
by Mauze and Crawford cut that down,
and the Presbyterians finished strong
with a burst of speed that carried them
to the front.

For Wake Forest, Carlyle and String-
field bore the brunt of the attack, with
Carlyle slightly shading his team-mate,
in speed and accuracy.

The Wildcats agaifi were a five man
team with Mauze the outstanding figure
on attack and defense. This lanky cen-
ter collected 13 points for the Wildcats
during the fray. Beall played a nice
game at forward caging the sphere three
times when scores were needed. Craw-
ford played his usual good game, rang-
ing up and down the floor breaking up
Wake Forest’s passing and helping ad-

.vance the’ball toward the Wildcat goal.

Elon Game.

On Friday night when the Wildcats
played the Elonites in Elon gym, the
goddess of chance, or some other direc-
tor of destinies decreed that the Red and
Black Machine should lose by the same
method by which they won the night be-%
fore. The Christians won the game by a
score of 34-30, both teams shooting an
equal number of field goals. Elon start-
ed the game off with aj rush and at the
end of the first half were leading by a

shots, and passed well, showing the best
form of any team encountered on the
trip. :

The Wildcats opened up in the’ last
half and at one time were in the lead,
Beall and

which they failed to hold.
Crawford did the best work for the
Davidson quint, each collecting a trio of
counters. Fix, Newman and Brown did
stellar work for the Elonites. Perry was
very accurate from the foul line and his
scoring free throws was the decisive fac-
tor ofvthe game.

Trinity Game.

The Wildcats tasted sweet revenge
last Monday night when they defeated
the fast Trinity quint at the auditorium
in Charlotte by a score of 32-27. The
defeat of Davidson at Trinity was com-
pletely wiped out for this game was
played on a neutral court.

The Wildcats sprang into the lead
after the first whistle and during the
entire contest were never.headed, During
the first half the wearers of the Red and
Black had everything their own way,
outeclassing the Methodists in every de-
partment of the game. In the second
half the followers of Wesley took a new
lease on life and almost closed up the
gap in the score, but the lead obtained
in the first half by the Davidsonians was
too great to be overcome. The passing
and team-work of the Wildcats during
the first half were the features of the
game.

For Trinity, Simpson and Spikes did
the best work. Simpson especially was
an accurate shot, caging the sphere five
times, and also playing a pretty floor
game.

Mauze played a pretty floor game, shot
fouls with accuracy and gave the oppos-
ing center a good time. Crawford play-
ed his usual dashing floor game and was
in the midst of the fray all the time.
Price materially helped to keep down
Trinity’s score by his fast and close
guarding.

Ormond was the high point scorer of
the contest, ringing the ball seven times
from the field. Beall did good work,
ranging up and down the floor, on de-
fense guarding closely, and on offense
helping bring the ball toward the hoop.

Both teams were handicapped by a
rather slippery floor and the game was
slower than it otherwise would have
been on that account.

|PURDY AND PRICE ELECTED
CLASS POET AND HISTORIAN

Freshmen Must Learn All College
Songs and Yells.

When the Fresh class was called to
order on the night of February 8th, in
Shearer Hall, there were several things
to be decided upon, and discussed.

The Vigilance Committee had an-
nounced that they had some things to
tell the class, and Lowry acting for
them, let is be known that the Fresh
class was to be called on, in a short
time, to prove their knowledge of Dav-
idson’s songs and yells.

Lowry then ~announced that the
amount at first asked, for the football
sweaters was insufficient, and, saying
that the class of '25 was expected to
measure up to its own standard, and to
do what it was asked to do, he intro-
duced Mac Richards of ’22, and Bob
Davidson, of ’23, who told, as an in-
centive to the Freshmen, what their re-
spective classes had done. The meet-
ing was then turned over to President
Hendricks. The class voted a small as-
sessment to make up the deficit on the
sweaters, y

It seemed that when, at the first of
the year, the Freshmen had agreed to
keep the “Y” room straight, it was un-
derstood that each man was to be told
when to report for duty. As nothing had
been done during the fall term, along
that line, the class again expressed its
willingness to do this.

As neither the Class Poet or Historian
had been elected at the regular class
election some time ago, this was done.
The office of Class Poet went to W. W.
Purdy, while H. B. Price was chosen

ing on Tuesday, February 7th. All the

Each paper was followed by a lively
discussion.

The program for the next meeting of
the Polity Club will deal with the sub-

on

ject: “Economic Conditions of the
World, Relative to the United States.”
There will be a paper on “Economic

Conditions in Germany, Relative to the
United States,” and one on “Economic
Conditions in the Philippines, Relative
to the United States.”

There will also be a discussion. of the
“Farmers’ Bloc,” which is making the
‘sturdy “Old Guard” sit up and take
notice, and’also of the Hague Conference
which is to continue the work of the
Washington Conference and endeavor
to readjust Europe’s tangled economic
situation.

CLIPPING DEPARTMENT IS
DAILY USED BY STUDENTS

During last week more than‘ three
thousand newspaper articles were dis-
tributed in the clipping department. This
represents most of the gleaning of the
current papers during November, De-
cember and January.

The clipping department, begun in
1910, now carries more than four thou-
sand. subjects. The newspaper articles
relating to and during the war period
are in separate cases and envolopes.

In addition to being used constantly in
the library work, packages are made up
from the material so stored, and-loaned
to individuals, clubs, debating teams,

TWELVE NEW MEN INITIATED

them being Freshmen. The election of
Pandeinic representatives for an inter-
scciety council also took place; J: C.

date news on topics ranging from the
Peace Conference to athletics. The de-
bate followed.

P. H. McAlpine and C. A. Young then
showed clearly why Japan should have
economic control over Korea and Shan-
tung. McAlpine had numerous refer-
ences on hand with which he enforced
his points and Young brought out his
points in a clear forceful way.. They
were opposed by T. M. Lowry and D. B.
Waltkall. Lowry showed thorough
knowledge of the subject and Walthall
had a logical, carefully prepared debate.
The negative won,

Last Thursday night the -Eumenean
Literary Society held its regular meet-
ing at 7:15 in the Eu hall. After the
devotional exercises, the question: Re-

control over Shantung and Korea, was
debated. Those on the affirmative were:
Elliott, McCutchen and Sharpe, while
Hollingsworth, Moss and McGukin up-
held the negative. The debate was good
and had more pep than has been seen in
the meetings for some time.

* After the debate a declamation was
given by Moffett and an oration by
Biddle. The newly elected officéts were
then installed. After Rolston Bitzer had
taken the oath of office as president, he
delivered his inaugural address, in which
he outlined plans for the spring term

proving the meetings of the society. A
most successful term is certain if his
plans‘are carried out.
