--One Davidson student said
during the intermission of
Emlyn Williams’ performance
last week in Love Auditorium,
“T have lots of work to do, but I
try not to let homework get in
the way of my education.’’ He
and all other members of the
audience for the third Artists’
Series performance of the year
were treated to an education in
itself by Williams’ one man
show “‘Dylan Thomas Growing
“Up.” -

‘The show, which depicts the
chil ‘stories of the young

Welsh poet Dylan Thomas,

began in the early 1950's.

Williams came to Davidson
from a two-week stay in San

‘Francisco and left immediately

for Connecticut. (‘‘Pronounce
all the c’s in Connecticut,”’ he
says.) He is now in the. six-
teenth week of a twenty-week
tour.

Williams’ presentation is an
established play with no _per-

formance liberties. ‘‘It’s like.
Hamlet,’’ he said,‘‘but less:

complicated.’’ He explained
that the text of his stories are
directly from Thomas, but that
he added some of the ‘‘in bet-
ween’’ material himself.

Cambodia Fund Drive continuing

Yuletide excitement has died
away, but not all of the spirit of
giving is gone. The Christmas
Gift Fund for Cambodian Relief
fell only slightly short of its
$10,000 goal.

According to Dean of Stu-
dents Will Terry, $8,309.62 was
raised, approximately $7,000 of
that contributed by students.
Said Terry, “I don’t remember
any project that solicited such a
wide number of contributors
from both organizations and
individuals.”

The money was given to The
Church World Service which is-
the major coordinator of the
for food which is immediately
sent to Cambodia.

Although there was no exact:
break-down of the origin of the
funds, the ‘contributors were

Even halls got involved. One

women’s upper-class hall gave
$320.00. The $450.00 offering
from the Christmas Vespers
also went toward the Cambo-
dian Fund Drive. The faculty
was also a key factor in this
fund drive, and there were
several Charlotte contributors,
according to Terry.

College President Samuel
Spencer officially kicked off the
fund drive at the December 1st
basketball game with Wofford.
The contributions were at their
peak during the week of the
9th-15th, but funds continued
to come in during the holidays,
according to Terry.

Although Davidson College

has a Christmas fund of some
kind every year, Cambodia was
chosen by the Council on Cam-
pus and Religious Life because
it,.seemed so urgent. Also,

were made to raise money for
Cambodian relief, the goal of
$10,000 was set.

The fund raising drive offi-
cially ended. the 21st of Decem-
ber, but more money can still be
sent. :

liams is famous in his own right
both as an actor and writer. His
acting ability was highly visible
in his performance last week.
Williams was Thomas from the
very beginning, but when he
wanted to become a crazy lady,
he could. He could also portray
Thomas’ fat uncle, or his little
friend Ray, or Polly with h

glasses on or with her glasses
off. His facial expressions made
his characters obvious, and the

. Welsh diction was delightful.

Thomas’ text assured the
success of the program also.
The romantic style and unique
metaphors were expert devices
for the story teller; and Wil-
liams’ delivery brought them
into full life. The humor and
humanity came. alive both
through Thomas’ verse and

In a recent article in The
International Jugglers Associa-
tion Newsletter (of which he is
editor), Giduz describes his
favorite pastime as “a jogging
dance with a three ball cast. The
jogger choreographs balls to
bounce off the pavement, fly
high in the air or whirl in a
cross-armed multitude of baff-
ling patterns. The legs provide
the beat, the arms make the
melody...The balls are never
boring, (jogging partners pro-
viding constant companionship
and diversion on a long run.”

Giduz says joggling elicits
quite a reaction from observers.
‘Some people just freak out,
others are amused, and some
zet. irritated because they think
you're showing off.”’

Giduz intrigued the crowds at
the recent Charlotte Observer
Marathon, where he joggled the
10 kilometer race. As far as he

However, Giduz recently ap-
peared on NBC’s Real People
and gave the fledgling sport
national television exposure;
new converts should be on the
way.

If the challenge appeals to
balls
and a bit of practice—the
jester’s outfit is optional. You
can learn the fundamentals of
juggling quickly and easily;
once you can juggle, you can
joggle..

For juggling instruction and
inspiration come to the first
meeting of the D.C. Juggling
Club, Monday the 21st from
7-8:30 in the 900 Room. Anyone
who is interested but cannot
attend, should contact Bill Gi-
duz in Chambers 135 or at
