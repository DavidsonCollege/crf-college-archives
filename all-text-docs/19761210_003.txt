ong like es the SGA
start or equa grounds with
the Trustees and administra-
tion,’’ he explained. ‘‘But
knowing the Trustees are be-
hind you lends power to any
project.”

Young praised outgoing
SGA President Bo Baskin,
but he thinks that ‘‘some
programs need to be looked at
and seen how realistic they
are.”’

He said Baskin sometimes
was reluctant to reveal his own
opinions on some issues before
the Senate.

“Bo has not expressed him-
self on some programs. He
hasn’t really directed the Sen-
ate in a positive way. I want to
lead the Senate in a positive

way but never before I'd
spoken to enough people,”’ he
said.

Young said that the presi-
dent has to be willing to work
with all kinds of people.

‘When you elect a president
of the SGA one important
characteristic should be some-
one who can work with anyone
and enthuse them. The impor-
tant thing is not the platform
the candidate runs on but his
enthusiasm for going out and
working,” he added.

Young explained that some
of his original programs will be
continuations of things al-
ready in the Senate.

He said he did not feel that
the fact he has never served in
the Senate will be a hindrance.

“TI think coming out of
nowhere shows that I’m not a
politician and that I am inter-
ested. If I can display my
enthusiasm and motivation
everything else will fall into
place,’ Young concluded.

Two sophomores, Guy Di-
Cenzo and Bruce Brown, vie
for the position of SGA Vice-
President.

DiCenzo sees his main func-
tion as supportive of the SGA
President. ‘‘The Vice-Presi-
dent has to do the footwork for
the President in the Senate
coordinating activities,’’ he
said.

Concerned with the Senate’s
lack of real power, DiCenzo
wants.to utilize the alumni and
Trustees in promoting SGA
program to the administra-
tion.

“The Senate has almost no
power, so we need to contact
alumni and get them on our
side because the school runs
on money and they control the
money,” he continued.

He said that in experimen-
ting in this program ‘‘we have
nothing to lose and everything
to gain.”

The Senate, he said, should
keep the students aware of
what’s going on through news-

letters and their communica-
tion program but students
should take the initiative, too.

“I feel as though the Senate
should act as the funnel for
students’ ideas and gripes. In
the past the funnel has been
sort of deficient,’’ he said.

Brown wants to work very
closely with the SGA Presi-
dent to work out programs
and ideas.

‘‘As an individual I will
have my own interests, but I'll
probably be working primarily
with the President in achie-
ving his objectives,”’ he said.

Brown also envisioned his
role as a kind of liaison with

‘ other organization outside the

Senate.

“I think the Vice-President
should be the one to work very
closely with organizations out-
side of the Senate, like Union
Board or Patterson Court
Council,’’ he continued.

Brown indicated that he
would like to work closely with

the new Senate visitation pro-

gram.

“I'd like to see it stream-
lined and made more effi-
cient,’’ he explained.

BROWN

‘‘IT want to help the Presi-
dent mobilize students outside
the Senate. This is a vast
resource that I think ought to
be used,” he added.

‘I’m not going to be just
another Senator nor will I just
be the President’s assistant,
but I’ll try to work with each
to get the job done,”’ conclu-
ded Brown.

PETER NICHOLLS, manager of the

Student Store, cites several problems

causing lack of texts.

Textbook shortage
hampers Store

By ANTHONY EVERMAN
Staff Writer

A shortage of texts in the
Student Store in the recent
past has caused a number
of students to have to borrow
or do without materials for
certain courses. Peter Nic-
holls, manager of the store,
blames these shortages on a
number of problems.

One of the most obvious of
these problems, according to
Nicholls, is the difficulty of
estimating the number of
texts needed for a given
section. “‘The numbers given
me at the time of pre-regis-
tration in no way approach the
number of students who actu-
ally enroll in a given course,”
said Nicholls.

This year it is even more
difficult to adjust to unexpec-
ted last minute increases be-
cause of the United Parcel
Service strike. No longer can a
needed book be ordered and
delivered within a few days.
Those students without books
must remain that way for a
much longer period of time.

Stated Nicholls: ‘‘The pro-
cess of reordering books has
been bogged down by the
strike which has in turn bog-
ged down the postal service by

which the books are now
ordered.”’

When asked why a surplus
of books was not ordered each
term, with the surplus (if any)
being returned, Nicholls said,
“If more than one-fifth of the
books ordered and delivered
were not sold, the remaining
books can not be sold back to
the publisher. Anyway, for
those courses for which less
than one-fifth of the books
remain, the cost of reshipping
is extremely high.’’

Other factors play a part in
depriving students of much-
needed books: As Nicholls
said, ‘‘Sometimes the -publi-
shers place books out of print
at sudden notice, which forces
the faculty to choose a differ-
ent text at the last minute.”
Faculty members sometimes
do not realize the current
slowness of shipment and
therefore expect late orders to
arrive much earlier than they
actually do.

No answer to this problem
has been found. As Nicholls
maintains, ‘‘The main reason
for our existence is to supply
the students with books as
smoothly as possible. If there
is another way to solve the
problem, I don’t know about
ity!

scholarship winners will be chosen on merit

selection process and the quality of people who went
to Chapel Hill as a result of the program.”

The fund was designed with potential for growth
and geographical expansion. If the results of the
first few years are successful, then the number of-
scholarships may be expanded in the future. For this
initial year, the program has been confined to North
Carolina and Florida in order to test its efficiency in
drawing top quality students before expanding it to
all of the Southeast and eventually all of the

country.

Goode elaborates, ‘‘We want to see what an offer
of $3000 will do, what kind of student it attracts.
Once we learn from this year’s limited outreach,
we'll be able to.expand, closely tying the program to .
alumni chapters wherever they are.’’

Scholarship recipients will also be eligible to

compete with other students on an equal basis for
aid from the college based on need. The fund’s board |~
of directors also hopes to set up a program to help
Stuart Scholarship winners find summer employ-

ment.

College administration officials are enthusiastic
about the program and hope that it will enable the
college to recruit students who otherwise would not
consider Davidson. Dean of Admissions H. Ed-
munds White comments, ‘‘The Stuart Scholarships

are a completely new element here, in that they are
based entirely on merit. Current scholarships are
based on merit to a degree, but the resulting

stipends are based exclusively on need.”’
White believes that the program will make
enrollment at Davidson a possibility for two groups.

“Not only will we attract those who otherwise would
go to an “Ivy League type”’
those from a middle class background who would
probably go to a large state university since a place
like Davidson would be out of their price range.”
Admission officials also hope the program will
produce a ‘‘ripple effect’’ by acquainting high school
‘students who do not qualify for a Stuart Scholarship
_with Davidson and consequently increase applica-
tions for admission.

The emphasis has been placed on merit rather
than need because of the relative scarcity of quality
merit scholarships in the Southeast and also
because, as Goode puts it, ‘‘winning a Stuart may be
\ the first time one of these kids has had a chance to
_do something entirely on his own.”

In contrast to the Morehead program, the Stuart
fund will accept contributions from interested
parties who have no connection with the Stuart
family. This ‘‘open-ended” approach will provide a
means for people who want to contribute to
Davidson to do so in a new, meaningful way.

The new Edward Crosland Stuart Scholarship
Program opens up a new realm of enhancement in
the years to come for Davidson. Goode emphasizes
this long range effect while commenting on his roje

institution, but also

| in the development of the fund. ‘‘This will live for

long after I’ve left/this earth. Davidson will reap the
benefits of this for a long time.”
