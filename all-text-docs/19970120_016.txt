On the road with the Wildcats

Men’s hoops prepares for league action with challenging pre-conference gauntlet

Durham, N.C., Dec. 11 -
Duke, coming off a 62-61 collapse
against Michigan on Dec. 8, was
either going to be short on confi-
dence or extremely angry going
into its tilt with Davidson.

Well,
the 14th-
ranked
Blue

‘Devils
were not only angry, but good, as
they used a barrage of three-point-
ers to turn a shaky 33-26 halftime
lead into a convincing 85-58 final
in front of 9,134 at fabled Cameron
Indoor Stadium.

“What I felt the Michigan
game could’ve presented for us
was the little bit of doubt that might
exist in Duke’s mind if it became
close down the stretch,” said coach
Bob McKillop.

“I think we positioned our-
selves pretty well in the first half,
but we were the ones who com-
pletely lost our poise in the second
half.”

.The first half represented a
virtual dead heat. Both squads
shot 12-for-27 from the floor.

Davidson actually posted a 15-

Your 1996-97 Wildcats have played in some storied arenas so far, but probably none more
impressive than the famed Cameron Indoor Stadium at Duke. (Note: The students are standing.)

13 rebounding edge and at times
even looked to be a step faster and
a notch hungrier than the Devils.
But Duke eventually estab-
lished itself, shooting 52.5% in the

"second frame and holding the sag-

ging Wildcats to 34.3%.
An 8-0 Duke run midway
through the lopsided period - 6

points by athletic swingman Ricky
Price and a Greg Newton jam -
inflated the lead to 21; squashing
any remaining upset fancies for
Davidson.

Newton and Price, two play-
ers for whom the Wildcats had no
match, dominated, scoring 22 and
19 points, respectively.

Narcisse Ewodo and Landry
Kosmalski paced Davidson, each
tallying 11 points. Bigman Chadd
Holmes added 10.

“T thought Chadd and Landry
were outstanding. I think it’s go-
ing to be a big boost to their confi-
dence,” said McKillop.

“Tt’s. a question of poise under,

pressure and a new experience for
a lot of these guys. They (Duke)
forced us to rush and make some
ill-advised decisions. Their whole
team is very, very talented.”

But Mike Krzyzewski, who
has led Duke to seven of the past
11 Final Fours and back-to-back
national championships in ‘91 and
‘92, was equally impressed with
McKillop’s plucky squad.

“T like Davidson a lot,” said
the legendary coach. “They havea
lot of heart and they keep putting
pressure on you. Bobby’s just an
outstanding coach. They have a
winning attitude and I’m surprised
we won by the margin we did.

“They’re a team where the
sum is greater than the total of its
parts. They’re always going to
play really well as a unit. You can
tell they’ve won a few years there
and they’ re going to win again this
year in their conference.”

“As disappointed as I am in a
loss, this is not the Southern Con-
ference - this is a Top 20 team,”
added McKillop. “It’s obviously
going to expose us and make us a
better team. Now can we grow
from it? That’s got to be the key.”

Wildcats fall to suddenly hot-shooting Minutemen

Amherst, Mass., Jan. 2 -
People in Massachusetts take their
sports very seriously. —

The professional sports teams,
like the area they represent, are
steepedin
tradition.

And
the sports
journal-
ism, perhaps unmatched in both its
quantity and quality, is at times
scathing.

Just listen to what respected
Boston Globe columnist Dan
Shaugnessy recently had to say
about former Minuteman star
Marcus Camby, who allegedly ac-
cepted gifts of money, jewelry,
and prostitutes from a potential
agent last year at UMass.

“Tt should be clear by now that
Marcus Camby is a pig who didn’t
belong in college,” he wrote on
Dec. 20. “Now we know he’s
stupid. And worse. He’s scum.”

The Minutemen have not only
lost their mystique and reputation
as a top-notch program, but after a
dream season in an otherwise dis-
mal year for New England sports,
they have shamed themselves, the
school, and the state.

All of this set the scene for
Davidson’s matchup with villified
UMass in which the Minutemen
never could quite put away the
Wildcats, but ended up with a 77-
64 victory.

UMass, which entered the con-
test shooting an icy 37.7% on the
season, broke out of the team-wide
slump, nailing 31-of-57 field goals
(54.4%).

Carmelo Travieso, who has

been forced to bear much of the
offensive burden recently with
backcourt mate Edgar Padilla nurs-

ing a shin contusion, tallied a sea- -

son-high 28 points.
All four of his three-pointers

came in the last 13 minutes of the
game and essentially killed any
hopes for a Davidson win.

“He got great looks, but [think
his teammates did a tremendous
job of getting him free,” coach
Bob McKillop said of the senior
who played for the Puerto Rican
Olympic squad in Atlanta.

“He got into his rhythm to-
night, and if he gets in his rhythm,
he’s dangerous.

“T’ve been struggling for a
while, so it felt real good to get
some shots to go through the bas-
kets,” said Travieso, who is shoot-
ing just 28% from behind the arc
this year, his supposed specialty.

But in terms of points, the last
4:26 of the first half marked the
difference in the game, as the Min-
utemen closed the period with a
13-2 run, turning a 26-26 count
into a 39-28 margin at intermis-
sion.

Other than that stretch, the
two teams played to a dead heat.

. And were itnotfor Davidson’s
subpar free throw shooting (16-

for-26) and Travieso’s late-game
bombs, the Wildcats would have
been right there with the Minute-
men at the end, if not ahead of
them.

Landry Kosmalski led the
Wildcats with 15 points and 8
rebounds. Mark Donnelly and
Narcisse Ewodo added 14 and 12,
and UMass’ lead was only 65-58
with 2:47 to go.

But first-year UMass head
coach Bruiser Flint was reluctant
to give Davidson’s squad much
credit and quick to blame his own.

“Davidson’s a well-coached
team, they shoot the ball well, but
I think most of the problems we
had tonight were ours,” said Flint.

“You watch the basketball out
there, I thought we were horrible. I
told my guys that wasn’t good
enough tonight.”

It was good enough to top the
Wildcats though.

“They weren’t in sync offen-

sively (up to this point),” said —

McKillop, “butthey certainly were
tonight.”

Cat-killer
Carmelo |
Travieso pulls
up for three in
last year’s
NCAA
tourney. After

' much of this
season, he
found his
stroke against
- Davidson,
pouring in 28
points.

Davidson, Dec. 14 - It was
as if the basketball gods couldn’t
pick a winner until the last pos-
sible second.

The backyard brawl between

the Char-

lotte
area’s
two top

basketball teams featured ten lead
changes and six ties and yanked
the season-high Belk Arena
crowd of 3,894 on a topsy-turvy
emotional roller coaster ride.

But in the end, the Wildcats
came up a deuce shy and
Mecklenburg rival UNCC - noto-
rious for blowing late-game leads
early this season - escaped with a
70-68 victory.

“We play a good 20 minutes
some games,” explained 49er
point guard Sean Colson, who
notched 18 points and five as-
sists. “But we still haven’t put a
40-minute game together yet.”

With the win, UNCC cap-
tured the Hornets’ Nest Trophy
for the first time in three years
and, perhaps more importantly,
local bragging rights.

“Tt was a game which we had
opportunities to win, and we
didn’t,” saidcoach Bob McKillop.
“But this team played its heart out
tonight. I am very proud of their
effort and very proud of their
performance.”

After a 35-35 first half,
Davidson built a five-point lead
on two occasions in the first eight
minutes of the second.

Butalayup at the 10:54 mark
by DeMarco Johnson (a game-
high 21 points) gave the 49ers a
51-50 advantage.

UNCC clung toits shaky lead

college-

until Ali Ton nailed three-pointer
with 6:50 left, making it 58-57,
Wildcats.

The fever pitch continued, as
Mark Donnelly - who buried a
then career-high five threes and
led the Wildcats with 18 points -
took a Narcisse Ewodo pass at the
foul line with 1:38 remaining and
calmy sunk a fall-away jumper,
giving the Wildcats a 64-63 lead.

But it would ultimately be
Davidson’s last.

Johnson dunked 11 seconds
after the Donnelly fade-away and
Andre Davis and Shanderic
Downs each added a pair of free
throws, putting the 49ers up, 69-
65, with 16 ticks left.

Ton made UNCC sweat one
more bullet though, knocking
down another long-distance bomb
with eight seconds to go, cutting
the margin to one.

“He made a couple of clutch
shots there at the end,” said Colson
of Ton, who finished with eight
points and six assists. “He wasn’t
known for his three-point shoot-
ing in our scouting, but at the end
he made those two big threes.”

After Colson made one-of-
two from the line, Ton took the
inbounds pass and was called for
a walk attempting a potentially
game-tying drive.

Ewodo added 14 points,
Chadd Holmes 12, and Landry
Kosmalski 11.

“I thought our guys did a
masterful job of executing down
the stretch, but I’d just like to
have that last play over again,”
said McKillop. “Ali just took it
one dribble too far. If he pulls up
andhe gets that jumper, you never
know how the game would end.”
