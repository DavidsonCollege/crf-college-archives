GREENVILLE, S.C., Feb. 15
- Inagame that was played inahigh
school-like atmosphere Saturday
night at the Lay Physical Activities

Center, the

men’s basket-

ball team

*“ routed

Furman to solidify its hold on sec-

ond place in the Southern
Conference’s North Division.

With the construction of anew
on-campus: arena underway, the
Paladins have been forced to play
their home contests in a 1,200-seat
bandbox of a gym this season.

As if that was not enough, the
scoreboard malfunctioned five sec-
onds into the game, leaving the ref-
erees to rely on a stopwatch to keep
time and a hand-held operator to
keep score.

“Both teams face the same kind
of adversity that this atmosphere
created,” said coach Bob McKillop.
“This is not the kind of things that is
easy to deal with.”

The one other thing that the Wild-
cats (15-9, 8-4 SC) had to deal with
was the prospect of an extra-in-
spired Furman squad. It was the
Paladins’ first outing since coach
Joe Cantafio announced his resig-
nation, and Davidson expected that
to provide an emotional lift for
Furman (10-14, 4-8 SC).

; “It was another piece of the -
puzzle that we had to overcome,”

said McKillop. “I thought our guys
handled it very admirably.”

That they did. .

Leading scorers Mark
Donnelly and Narcisse Ewodo tal-
lied just six points apiece, but the
Wildcats more than compensated
with strong interior play.

Stephen Marshall poured in a

_ career-best 16 points on 8-of-9

shooting and grabbed a game-high
six rebounds.

Chadd Holmes scored 14 points
and Landry Kosmalski added 13

And David Burns again picked
up the slack from the perimeter,
scoring 15in 11 minutes. Eleven of
those came in the last 2:30 of the
first half, as he sparked a 15-2 run
that broke a 30-30 tie and gave the
Wildcats a 45-32 lead at the break.

“The whole game was David
Burns at the end of the half,” said

Cantafio.
The Wildcats continued the

’ pressure in the second half. A Billy

Armstrong three-point play gave

Davidson a 62-40 lead with 12 min-

utes to play.

Davidson has now won four in
a row - their longest streak of the
season - and seem to be getting hot
at just the right time.

“T think our defense in the sec-
ond half was as good as it’s ever
been for a period of about seven or
eight minutes,” said McKillop.
“And our offensive precision com-
ing off that defense was like sur-
gery.

“We’re starting to do some
things with a great passion. We’re
really clicking offensively and de-
fensively, and we’re positioning
ourselves the way we had hoped to
when we set out back on Oct. 15.”

GREENVILLE, S.C. - The
Wildcats’ next win will mark the
program’s 1,000th all-time victory,
no small accomplishment accord-
ing to coach Bob McKillop.

“That’s going to be very spe-
cial for us to be part of No. 1,000,”

he said. “I’m certainly going to let
our players know that they have a
chance to be part of history.”

The win will also be
McKillop’s 116th, which puts him
third on Davidson’s all-time list be-
hind the legendary Lefty Driesell
(176) and Norman Shepard (170).

court following the game, but should

“Cisco’s a survivor.”

Paladin coach Cantafio
bids farewell

Furman third-year head coach

Joe Cantafio announced his resig-
nation on Thursday. The move will
take effect at
the season’s
end.

Appar-
ently, it took

13-year-old
daughter’s

Cantafio that coaching was no
longer for him.

“You can’t stay in this busi-
ness forever,” he said Saturday. +
think it was time I let someone else
do it because I was just getting tired
and worn out.

“When you have children and
you wake up and they’re gone, I
don’t want that to happen to me.
I’m just going to spend time with
my children and watch them do
some things,” added Cantafio, who
also has an eight-year-old son.

His overall 109-195 collegiate
head coaching record at VMI and
Furman may havehelped make the
decision a little easier, although
Cantafio claims he was not pushed
out.

He will look into future posi-
tions in athletic administration,
sales, and maybe television.

Scoreboard fiasco

The scoreboard and clock at
Furman’ s makeshift arena malfunc-
tioned in the first half, delaying the
game 15 minutes and causing the
entire initial period.to be played
church league-style - with a stop
watch and flip cards to keep score.

The Paladins are playing their
home games this season in the 1,200-
seat Lay Physical Activities Center
while a new on-campus 5 000-seat
facility is being built.

The cramped confines, lack of
seating, extraordinary number of
random and multi-colored lines on

~ the floor, poor acoustics, and Spar-_

tan locker room ‘facilities give
Furman’s temporary, home. a dis-
tinct high school feel, but Saturday
night’s mechanical debacle set: new
standards.

“T thought the refs were just

outstanding in game management
and I thought the Furman people
did an outstanding job of handling a
very difficult situation,” McKillop
said.

“It’s kind of embarrassing,”
said Cantafio. “Here we have a
Division I game and you don’t have
a clock. There are so many lines,
you cannot only play checkers and
chess on this floor, you can also

play parcheeze.”

Burns sizzling

In the seven games since the
Citadel contest Jan, 27 in Charles-
ton, S.C., swingman David Burns
has USES an offensive machine off
the bench,
pouring in 87
points in 93
minutes.

His
scoring spree
has coincided
with much
improved de-
fense and re-

game. “It’s rare that you call a

‘one other than. Mark when he’s in.
the game. That’s the kind of confi- _
: dence this team has in David

Burns.”’... -

Freshman - guard Davor
Halbauer posted a career effort vs.
ETSU, logging a career-high 18
points, five boards, and three assists
in a team-high 25 minutes.

The Croatia native has
struggled with his defense at times
throughout the year, but made great
strides in that respect on Monday.

“I have never had any prob-
lems whatsoever with Davor’s abil-
ity to handle the basketball and
score,” noted McKillop. “He’s as
good as anyone in our program. In
fact, he’s probably the most cre-
ative offensive player we have. But
Davor has really worked hard to
learn to play defense.

“Tonight was his greatest per-
formance as a defensive player at
Davidson. It’s ironic that it was
also his greatest performance as an
offensive player.”...

Stephen Marshall set career
bests in points and assists in
Saturday’s affair, notching 16 and
two. The 6-8 rookie post player
shot 8-for-9 from the floor in 24
minutes. er aa ;
