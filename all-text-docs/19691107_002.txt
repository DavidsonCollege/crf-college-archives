A 2-2-1] Season

AN EDITORIAL

If the commission reports released
this week were to face a regular five-
game season, one at a time, the odds
would be in favor of them producing
a 2-2-1 season. ;

That’s. the way, in our’ initial but
careful judgment, the reports stack
up: two winners, two losers and a
slightly-better-than-normal tie.

The relative strengths and weaknes-
ses of each report have been deter-
mined not only by their conclusions,
but also by their methods and their
presentation. .

COEDUCATION — A WINNER

Even if one took away the flawless
prose of Professor Frank Bliss, the
report would still win. It was tho-
rough, in fact exhaustive, in seeking
information on which to base its de
cision,

It may be that the committee mem-
bers see the situation a bit too rosily
in some respects, and in this lies the
report’s own weakness.

It may be too simple to talk ¢con-
fidently of the ease the college might
have in obtaining the necessary $8
million increase in endowment, to
say nothing of the $5 million capital
expenditure for additional facilities.
(This does not include the expenditure
for the required extra library space
and seating.)

It also seems that the commission
has too easily upped the student-fac-
ulty ratio from 12-1 up to 14-1. Many
classes are too large already without
opting for a less favorable ratio.

One final weakness is the failure
to follow up on several questions which
the commission identifies as impor-
tant considerations in the coed plan:
namely. Davidson’s location in the
South; its history as a church-related
college; and its history as a liberal
arts school. The first two are not
dealt with at all, though the third
gets some attention.

In spite of these shortcomings, the
report succeeds in its presentation
and its conclusions because of the
great amount of research and docu-
mentation whith it contains. That
gives it somewhat of an edge over
its companion reports.
EXTRA-CAMPUS RESPONSIBILITIES

A WINNER

The ECR Commission offered one
of the better reports because it is
fairly innovative and futuristic.

* One wishes that transcripts of the
commission hearings with the most
relevant data and testimony were be-
ing made available at the time. It
would produce an even stronger case
with more supporting material.

Some of the recommendations are
too indefinite. The report does not
say why 100 was the number of black
students chosen as the “critical
mass.” The report was also a bit
vague on black faculty andsadminis-
trators.

Probably the greatest deficiency in
the ECR report is that it lacks a real
sense of urgency and commitment
necessary to carry out their program
at Davidson, and it fails to project
the sort of institutional change that
will be necessary.

Perhaps the most revealing. thing
about this report is its apologetic man-
ner. Although it is somewhat pre-
sumptious of Davidson College to

. think that it can mold black students
into leadership roles, it does give
the need for educated black leadership
in the South as the primary justifica-
tion ria ats program for the disadvan-
taged.

he wirihingest point about the
whole\.commission is the realization
that Davidson is actuatly going to do
something about the outsidesworld,
and perhaps in doing so it will re-
join the present.
_ATHLETICS — A LOSER

Aside from the fact that one of its
basic assumptions is being disproven
by this year’s football team, this com-
mission falls short of what it could

wiwo artim

be.

There are some very ambiguous
points. For example, the note in the
appendix on financial statistics says
that the Savings from a desubsidiza-
tion of football would be partially
decreased because need scholarships
would be given in their place. But no
indication is given as to how much
of a savings would be entailed in such
a move.

The statistics themselves
terribly convincing.

Statistically the commission follow-
ed only the opinion of the faculty,
pretty much disregarding the answers
to the student and alumni question-
naires.

The weakness of this report lies in
that it did not go far enough in its
research. More information on other
schools in similar situations would be
beneficial.

The results of the commission are
bound to be unpopular with students
and alumni, but more thorough docu-
mentation would have at least offered
a motive for the conclusions reached.
Stats alone are not enough to pro-
duce a winner, as the football team
has learned from the past.

CHURCH

RELATIONSHIP — A LOSER

Regardless of any personal beliefs
or convictions, the church relationship
commission falls short of the goal. ,

The tone and texture of the report
is apologetic and defensive, rather
than positive, regarding the premise
that Davidson should maintain its ties
with the Presbytérian church.

We do not disagree with the de
cisign, but we are disappointed that
the commission did not thoroughly
justify this recommendation and more
or less accepted it as a working hy-.
pothesis, This will convince very few
persons.

The argument presented in the re-
port rests strongly on the concept of
the Church’s parenthood over the col-
lege and of the college’s ‘grateful
child” image. a iaaeea:

There is a weakness in the Program
Subcommittee’s suggestion that any
act of service or goodwill by the stu-
dents shows support of the church,

Also, questionnaires are invalid un-
less percentages or numbers respond-
ing are indicated.

The report does offer some good

are not

recommendations (removal of religious

limitations on faculty and administra-
tion), but the report in most parts’
represents a weak effort by a distin-
guished group.

SOCIAL PATTERNS — A TOSS-UP

The report of the social patterns
commission represents a _ careful,
thoughtful study, based on many good
points, and points out.the failures of
the college to provide proper housing,
eating arrangements and social out-
lets.

But at the same time, there is a
weakness in the conclusion as evidenc-
ed by the dissenting members of the
commission. When there is dissent
among the team members, it is dif-
ficult for the team to put up a solid
defense. Such dissent within the com
mission is damaging to the impact of
the report, for the alumni, students
and trustees of the college cannot
be expected to accept what is not
agreeable to a eommittee of ten-men.

It seems only natural to assume
that the commission would have rec-
ognized this point, and in spite of
time limitations come up with a pro-
prety of compromise more acceptable
to all.

The team analogy can go only so
far, but the reports do offer much in
a number of areas while falling short
in others. Our evaluations are reaction-
ary, because evaluations of this nature
must be. More time and more study
will help to smooth over the problems
so that by the time the trustees are
ready to act in January, the reports
might. expect a better season.

inherent in a church-collo
relationship. We have ask d

relationship to

the church. If so, what
would be the most desirable
form for this relationship to
take?

* We have. concluded that

church and college can work
together, and that the fruit
fulness of such a union is
dependent upon the quality
of the relationship. There-
fore, we have assumed the
responsibility of reconmend-
ing some changes in David-

>son’s relationship with the
church to the end that
her effectiveness and her
faith commitment may be
enhanced. . .

The fact that a_ large
number of good colleges

are church - related today
and value that relationship
speaks volumes in behalf of
the union of faith and rea-
son, the compatibility of
commitment and _ inquiry,
the feasibility of a Christian
institution of higher learn-
ing. . Therefore, your Com-
mission has attempted to
pinpoint the conditions pre-
vailing at such institutions
which may be contributing
vin» a wholesome
church-college relationship.

We have identified the fol-
lowing; though there may
well be others: 1) Formal
ly stated legal strictures
based on religious consider-
are minimal, For
and students, there
are no religious restrictions.
2) Serious con-
cern informally implement-
ed characterizes these cam-
puses. 3) An ecumenical
spirit appears to go hand in
hand with intellectual in-
quisitiveness.

The future — of
College can lie in either of
two directions: that of an
independent liberal arts _col-
lege, or that of a church-re-
lated institution of higher
learniig. As a Commission,
we believe that the latter al-
ternative is much to be pre-
ferred.

We are convinced that, for
the most part, Davidson's
historical relation to the
church has been construc-
tive and that the future can
be built upon that past...
We say: ‘for the most part’’
in order to keep faith with
the evidence we have gath-
ered. An examination of the
appended testimonials of
members of the Commission
(faculty, students and trus-
tees), department chairmen,
and the dean of the college,
along with an analysis of
the_responses given by some
faculty, students and alumni
to. a questionnaire, reveal
that ‘‘church relatedness”
has its negative side for
many who are intimately in
volved in and concerned
about the life of Davidson.

It should be noted in this
connection that while a Cal-
vinist tradition as mediated
through the Presbyterian
Church, a majority of the

more extensive and inten-

We recommend that Da-
vidson continue to operate

as a residential college with
students being permitted to
live off campus only for
reasons deemed appropriate
by the Dean of Students’ Of-
fice,

Residential Provisions

It is important that the
residential provisions be ap-
pealing to the students. The
dormitories are noisy, — in-
and provide lit-
tle that makes for commun-
ity. Housing should provide
(1) inducements for com-

ambiguities with
which this Commission has
been faced throughout its
deliberations is: Does the
Board of Trustees, a large
majority of whose members
elected from and by
presbyteries, represent. the
church or the college?

Are they custodians of the
college for the church, or
is their primary allegiance
to the college?

The Board owns the col-
lege; but we say that David-
son is owned and operated
by The Presbyterian Church,
Furthermore, the only. of-
ficial relationship that the
church has to the college
is in the electing of trustees,

This is done by a few sup-
porting presbyteries, not by
a synod or the General
Assembly als it any wonder
then that*JDavidson’s rela-
tionship ,to the church is
thought of In terms of the
makeup and function of her
Board of Trustees?

For the moment, however,
let us rise above these am-
biguities and recognize the
leadership that the church
has offered to those who
have had the courage to fol-
low. ‘

In 1931 the General Assem-
bly of the Presbyterian
Church, U. S. recommended
that all Presbyterian educa-
tional institutions who of-
“fered ROTC make the offer-
ing completely voluntary. As
an institution Davidson did
not respond affirmatively to

are

this recommendation — until
1969.

In 1954 the General
Assembly approved of the

Civil Rights” Act and recom-
mended that her institutions
fulfill its spirit. Davidson
had not acted affirmatively
on this matter when in 1960
the Board of World Missions
requested that Presbyterian

colleges accept students
from the Congo.

This request made it
easier for our Board to

break the color barrier, first
with Congolese and later
with native American Negro
students. In the mid-1960's,
when the question of banning
controversial speakers from
college campuses was an
important issue in North
Carolina, the President of
Davidson felt free to affirm
that Davidson would main-
tain an open campus, and
the Davidson Chapter of A-
AUP led the fight to kill the
speaker ban law.

It is interesting that the
president and faculty of a
church-related college could
and would take the lead in
dealing with an issue that
threatened the principle of
freedom of spaech on state
school campuses.

On our campus there ‘is
freedom; freedom to speak
one’s mind in class and
out; freedom to experiment
with curricular offerings, re-
ligious and cultural pro-
grams and recreational ac-
tivities. There is freedom be-
cause there is respect for
one another and a_ sense of
being responsible to all.

And we suspect that some-
how at Davidson this free-
dom and responsibility are
tied up with Davidson's com-
mitment to faith with learn-
ing. ‘

Not only has the church
given inspiration and foster-
ed freedom, she has provid-
ed financial backing for the

“demic

munity and (2) opportunity
for privacy.

Community

Optimum communication
takes place in groups which
are large enough for the pro-
vision of stimulating diver-
sity and not so large that
one must be on guard against
the demands of too many
people.

To insure optimum com-
munication we recommend
that the residence halls be
modified to provide residen-
tial units, each housing
about 80 to 100 students, and

that each unit be designed
with a common room
(lounge) through which all
students’ must. ordinarily

pass when entering or leav-
ing the unit——

In addition to the com-
mon lounge, we recommend

that each residential unit
have its own dining area
and adequate kitchenette

college. Most important of
all, she has*supplied people:
trustees, administrators, fac-
ulty and students.

In turn, the college has
served the church in ways
appropriate to the function
of art educational institution,
administrators and faculty
members have served on
committees of the church
courts, written materials for
‘church use and spoken to
church groups. Over a fourth
of the ministers in the Pres-
byterian Church, U. S., at-
tended this college.

Our report in general and
our recommendations in
particular are designed to
show what we believe to be
desirable ways and means
of conserving the yalue in-
herent in a w holesome
church-college rétationship—
values that will be lost if
the college separates from
the church—values that will
be jeopardized if the rela-
tionship is less than whole-
some.

The gist of our argument
may be stated quite simply.
‘Davidson should move into
the future as a church-relat-
ed college. And she’ should
not apologize for this rela-
tionship. She should take her

statement of purpose
seriously.
In particular she should

-affirm by word and practice
her concern for the whole
man to the end that students
may find themselves in an
environment that is conduc-
tive to the development of
a dynamic faith and a spirit
of intellectual integrity and
vigor.

We believe that such an
environment can. best be
maintained when the rela-
tionship with the church is
serious. but informal rather

than juridical and prescrip-

tive.

We do not mean that the
church should relinquish all
responsibility for supplying
menibers of the Board of
Trustees—as our recommen-
dations bear witness, We are
talking——in—relative rather
than in absolute terms. But
what w& believe to be need-
ed is a change in outlook,
emphasis and ‘focus.

Perhaps the church should
remind herself that just as
she has established and sus-
tained hospitals for the pur-
pose of healing, so she has
given birth and life to David-
son for the purpose of edu-
eating. Illness and ignorance
are to be fought for Christ's
sake. 3

From a different perspec-
tive, the college should re-
think its relation to the
church. Instead of carping
like petulant children, or
assuming the role of admin-
istrative prima donnas who
could run the college much
better than any church-elect-
ed Board, we who make up
the college community
should daily give thanks for
the vision, leadership and
finances which the church
has provided. Without her
concern for good education,
Davidson would not exist.

How should the college ex-
press this gratitude? By ful-
filling the purpose for which
she_was founded: that of
becoming an excellent aca-
institution in which
the Christian view of the
world, man, and history are
taken seriously—that of de-
veloping men of humane in-

facilities.

Privacy

To provide guch privacy
as is needed, and we recog-
nize that individuals differ
with respect to need for pri-
vacy, we recommend that
residential units be struc-
tured so as to allow some
Students to occupy single
rooms permitting flexibility,
so that a gi®én group of
rooms may be utilized dif-
ferently at different times.

To induce community and
to work for the advoidance
of isolated cliques, we suggest
that suites be kept fairly
small (maximum number of
persons in a Suite 8).

Residential Units
Women students
If the college should be-
come coeducational, we re-

commend that the residential
units (and their associated
dining areas) be coeduca-
tional.

stincts who put the service
of fellowman above self-ser-
vice,

As a church-related col-
lege matures, it likes to af-
firm its own identity and
worth. As a good parent, the
church should welcome such
signs of growth. And if she
is wise she can find ways
and means of keeping the
family intact, while acknow-
ledging the offspring as sep-
arate and different in struc-
ture and purpose.

FINDINGS

(1) Schools responding to
our inquiries do not regard
religious commitment as in-
imical to the educational
process. Rather they re-
gard the religious element
as a positive factor on cam-
pus.

(2) They tend to regard in-
formal relations between
church and college as more
desirable than highly forma-
lized and legal ones.

(3) These institutions have
minimal religious _ restric-
tions on administrators and
trustees and none on, facul-
ty and students.

(4) None of them feels that
academic freedom is_ jeo-
pardized by the religious af-
filiation of the institutions.

(5) The American Associa-
tion of ‘Colleges reports that
it finds the religious com-
mitment of instructions to be
a rare factor in complaints

about abridgment of  aca-
demic freedom.
(6). The faculty and stu-

dents of Davidson do not feel
that their academic free-
dom is circumscribed. But
same faculty members sug-
gest that the lack of variety
on the faculty and the pro-
scriptions on certain depart-
ments perpetuate an_intel-
lectual straightjacket.

(7) Most Davidson faculty,
students and alumni want to
see the college retain its

church relationship and
Christian commitment in
some form.

(8) (Most faculty, students
and alumni affirm that Da-
vidson’s church relationship
influenced their coming here
to some extent.

(9) Most of these three
groups feel that the current
requirement in the area of
courses in religion is about
right.

(10) Most of the faculty
and students would like to
get rid of the restrictive
measures in the official do-
cuments of the college af-
fecting the hiring of admini-
strators and affecting the
hiring and granting of tenure
to faculty personnel.

(11) Most faculty, students
and alumni feel that the
Board of Trustees’ is un-
necessarily large, and that
membership on the. Board
should be less circumscrib-
ed.

(12) A significant number
of students is participating
in. the religious programs
on campus.

Black students
In case of the unexpected
increase in the proportion of
black students, we recom-
mend that precautions be
taken against extensive re-
segregation.

Assignment of Students to
Residential Units
Because we believe that the
greatest benefits from col-
lege are tied to exposure to
new and varied experiences,
we recommend that all resi-
dential units be composed
of students of all four classes
and that each year the fresh-
men be assigned randomly.
for initial assignment of the
upperclassmen beyond the
provisions (1) that all three
upper_classes and the fresh-
men be represented propor-
tionally and (2) that there
be no numerical domination
by the members of one or
two fraternities. ;
Composition of Suites
We recommend that there
be further study on the as-
signment of suites, takin’
into consideration the goal
of insuring diversity of com-

position.

Organized Activities of

Residential Units

The residential units should
seek frequent relatively in-
formal_association in the
lounges and in the dining
Areas with faculty members
and with visitors who can »
contribute to the academic
and Cultural aspects of the
college's program,

Perhaps each residential
junit should invite several.
faculty members to be Fel-
lows who will have frequent
contacts with the residents.

Small Group Social
Organizations

The college should provide
to every student full oppor-
tunity for sharing in its so-
cial program. Under the pre-
sent circumstances, social life
is. dominated by the twelve
fraternities, membership in
which is by invitation.

The exclusion of some stu-
dents, whether based on a
single blackball or on a num-
ber of negative votes, means
that some students do not
have an option that others
have.

We recognize that there
will always be selectivity in
the composition of friendship
and other groupings, and we
recognize that there are
pleasures and advantages in- -
herent in being accepted by a
selection-rejection procedure.
. The majority of the com-
mission holds that the disad-
vantages for the rejected
students on a Campus whose
social life is. dominated by
the organized and institution-
ally-chartered selective (ex-
clusive) groups, as operative
at Davidson currently, call
for restructuring of social
organizations to counteract
and eliminate these disadvan-
tages. 1

The majority of the com-
mission regards the college
as presently not only condon-
ing but even promoting the
domination of social life by
the fraternities, and we re-
commend that steps be taken
to provide full participation
in the social life of the cam-
pus by centering social ac-
tivities in the residential
units and permitting all off-
campus students to become
unrestricted participants in
the social activities of the
residential units,

Dining Facilities Associated
with Each Residential Unit
To supplement the influ-
ences toward community pro-
vided by the common lounges
of the residential units, we
recommend that each resi-
dential unit have its own |
dining unit and that the din-
ing units now operated by
the fraternities be divorced

from the fraternities.

There are several ways in
which dining units may be
operated in connection with
residential units, including:

_Expansion of College Union

Services

The Union may expand its
food space and food services
and provide a restricted din-
ing area for each residential
unit.

New Construction Outside

the Union §

New dining areas may be
built in or adjacent to. their
respective residential units.
Utilization of Space Now

Allotted to . Fraternities

A majority of the commis-
sion believes that as long as
the fraternities continue to
operate their dining facilities
the proposal to center the so-
cial life on the campus in the
residential units has little

or no chance of becoming

effective.
