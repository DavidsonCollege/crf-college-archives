shake-—this was a common sight during
the Convention. Friends who had not
seen each other for years, met and re-
freshed the. memories of ald acquaint-
ance, Most interesting to Davidson
amen was the frequent reunion of old
college friends who had been) separated
from each other for years and) maybe
tens of years. “Phere were alumni in
Charlotte whose classes went as far back
as the sixties and seventics, and these
were just as happy to see cach other as
the present Seniors and Juniors were to
see their friends of the classes recently
