as the team of the year to beat in

Schmidt Leads

Last year's Middie team was su-

tage of experience. The team

their three defensive formations to
the best advantage. A great deal
has been said about the Wildcats’
new razzle-dazzle but it
has not yet been in evidence. May-
be the Tars will get a look at it
Saturday. William and Mary held
the Navy to one touchdown during
the first 54 minutes of play and

offense,

with a few breaks Davidson has a
chance to win this game.
