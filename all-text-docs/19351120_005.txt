MCCLURE TALKS
FOR MINISTERIAL
BAND GATHERING

MEET IN SOCIAL CENTER

Raises Question Of What Work
« Remains For Group

The Davidsonian Ministerial Band met
Sunday afternoon, in the Social Center,
with Albert McClure of the Y. M. C. A.
as the speaker. Fourteen members of the
organization were present.

James Salango opened the meeting with
a passage from the Bible, and Mr. Mc-
Clure led in prayer. The meeting was
turned over to “Mac” McClure after an
able introduction by Salango.

McClure, while a student here at Da-
vidson, was also a member of the Minis-
terial Band, so was able to give a good
many practical and helpful suggestions.
In its early days, he said, the Band used
to take the place of the “Y,” and tried to
handle all the religious work on the cam-
pus. Now with the coming of the “Y”,
most of this work has been taken out of
the hands of the Band. “What remains
for the Band to do?” was the question
the speaker tried to answer in his talk.

“In his college days,” the speaker con-
tinued, “after the “Y” took over much
of the Band’s work, meetings used to be
held every Sunday, in Shearer Hall.
These meetings did not prove to be a
very good thing for various reasons. In
general the attendance was poor, (a thing
which is true on the campus today) and
nothing was accomplished. A later effort
was to hold Social meetings once a month,
instead of the regular weekly services,
for the purpose of creating good fellow-
ship, and acquainting the members of the
Band with each other. These meetings
were, of course, conducted with devo-
tionals.” Altogether, however, the speak-
er said, the Ministerial Band accom-
lished very little, and amounted to very
little as a force on the campus.

McClure, in connection with the
question of having a key as the insignia
of the Band said that members of the
Band ought to be able to be recognized
as Ministerial Candidates by their. life
and conduct on the campus, not by an
insignia. The speaker said, “Men should
be able to say of you, ‘That man must be
going into the Ministry,’ rather than look-
ing at your key, say, ‘Why is that man
going into the Ministry?’ ”

In connection with going on deputa-
tions and such work, the speaker pointed
out that everyone likes to go away to
preach. “We all love to go on deputa-
tions; but too much stress is being laid
on the campus. Going somewhere else to
_ preach is. the easiest and nicest thing to

After the news of the campus
given in brief, Mr. Pfohl played “Dear
Old -Duke” and “Hark the Sound of Tar
Heel Voices” on the organ in honor of
these two universities who met on the
gridiron Saturday. The orchestra then
saluted two of the country’s greatest
teams: Northwestern with North-
