Most fraternities live in fear of being
off campus, but not FIJI.

By Ashlyn Dannelly

The Phi Gamma Delta house
off campus remains a place of un-
known mystery for most Davidson
College students. But, according
to newly elected FIJI president
Taylor Hartley, an increasing num-
ber of students have been riding
the “Phi Gam Tram” to parties this
year.

The History

Many people assume that the
Davidson FIJI chapter is located
off campus because of drug-re-
lated offenses in the 1970s. But,
according to FIJI historian Towner
Blackstock, this is not the case.

FIJI built their house in the
summer of 1972 as a response to
the Trustees’ and then-college-
president Sam Spencer’s decision
to impose a self-selection system
on fraternities. Instead of folding
as many of the fraternities did,
FIJI, along with Sigma Phi Epsi-
lon, opted to move off campus,
The Phi Gamma Delta’s built a
house in the summer of 1972 with
a loan from the national fraternity.
That house, which president Tay-
lor Hartley describes as a “gray
Pizza Hut,” still serves today as the
FIJI house.

Drug problems emerged for
the FIJI house in the late 70s and
early 80s, as drug use increased on
campus with the college’s liberal-
ization. As Blackstock says, the

loss of such institutions as required
chapel and required ROTC and the
emergence of the Code of Respon-
sibility allowed a drug cult to
emerge, as it did nationally.

Finally, in 1982, the national
fraternity stepped in, forcing the
resignation of about 30 brothers
who refused to sign an anti-drug
proclamation. That loss, coupled
with the graduation of about 25
brothers that year, caused an im-
mediate decline in the strength of
the house, which in 1981, had
claimed about 110 members, one-
tenth of the Davidson College
population.

FIJI barely held on until the
fall of 1989, when 8 graduates as-
sembled 14 freshmen to recolo-

-nize the house. The Class of 1993

provided the backbone for the cur-
rent brothers. According) to
Blackstock, “They saw the oppor-
tunity to basically start their own
fraternity and do it the way they
wanted.”
The Advantages

The FIJI brothers seem to en-
joy their small size. According to
Taylor Hartley, “We like the fact
thatit’s small. More people would
always be better, but we have
enough to get by.” There are cur-
rently 14 FIJI brothers, with one
additional person abroad. Also,
the house will have nine pledges
this spring. As Blackstock says,

The Phi Gamma Delta house is located off campus, but their presence is still felt. The brothers
have voted that if they have a chance to return to campus, they will not take it.

“We’re comfortable with our small
size. I’d rather have that than have
30 guysI didn’t know inthe house.”
The house also revels in their
off-campus status. The FIJI broth-
ers have voted not to return to
campus if there is an opportunity
to do so. The house does not have
to pay rent since the national fra-
ternity owns the building, unlike
the houses on Patterson Court,
which are owned by the school.
In fact, no other fraternity can
move into an off-campus house if

Faculty committee passes on it own Statement

Purpose continued from page 1

jamin Klein serve as faculty mem-
bers.

Together, their duty was to
review and edit the Statement of
Purpose, retaining as much of the
existing document as possible
while working to make it more
inclusive of the various people and
religions represented at Davidson.

According to McKelway, a
religion professor, this was not an
easy task. He says, “I now under-
stand why the Nicean Creed took
so long to produce.”

Although the changes pro-
posed by the committee were hard
to come by, McKelway believes
the effort was worth it, as the re-
vised document espouses “a more
open and welcoming attitude” to-
ward the wide range of people at
Davidson,

The revised version has been
reviewed by the Executive Com-
mittee of the Trustees, and awaits
approval from the whole board

when they meet in February. It is
being circulated among faculty and
students, and committee members
are willing to listen to their input.

At Wednesday’s forum, a
majority of the debate revolved
around the revised document’s sec-

~ ond paragraph. The first two sen-

tences of this new paragraph read,
“Davidson commits itself to a
Christian tradition which recog-
nizes God as the source of all truth
and finds in Jesus Christ the rev-
elation of that God, a God bound
by nochurch or creed. The loyalty
of the college thus extends beyond
the Christian community to the
whole human community and in-
cludes an openness to and respect
for the world’s various religious
traditions.”

These sentences are to replace
the old statement’s claim that
Davidson “sees Jesus Christ as the
central fact of history.”

Some students feel that these
two sentences contradict each
other, emphasizing Christianity,

yet following with an affirmation
of all religions.

However, McKelway believes
that acceptance of other beliefs isa
natural result of Davidson’s Chris-
tian heritage. He worries that, “if
you don’t specify this, people as-
sume otherwise,” labeling
Davidson as an exclusively Chris-
tian school.

Others believe that the State-
ment of Purpose should not in-
clude any theological pronounce-
ments at all, but should simply
state Davidson’s goals as an insti-
tution.

Klein pointed out that the
document’s importance extends
beyond the highly debated second
paragraph. He wants to ensure that
Davidson’s commitments to ser-
vice and internationalism are ex-
pressed in the revised document.

Some of this is reflected in a
new paragraph which states,
“Davidson values diversity and
seeks to be a community which
recognizes the dignity and inher-
ent worth of every person.”

According to SGA Senator
Jennifer Humphrey, the crux ofthe
struggle with the Statement of Pur-
poseis how to reconcile Davidson’s
Presbyterian heritage with its cur-
rent composition of faculty and
students.

According to McKelway, the
revised version was crafted in an
effort to “be honest” about what
Davidson stands for today.

On February 4, the Trustees
will have the final say about just
how honest they think this new
statement is.

they chose to. Zoning restrictions
forced the Sig Ep’s back on cam-
pus. Since then, no fraternities
have been allowed to set up house
in Davidson. Also because of those
laws, if FIJI decided to move back
on campus, then they would not be
allowed to move off again, creat-
ing a truly unique situation. Ac-
cording to Blackstock: “There’s
no chance in hell that we would
ever come back on campus.”

Hartley also sees an advan-
tage in having parties off-campus.
“You can go out there and do what
you want. There are no police
hanging around bothering you.”
Also, the “Phi Gam Tram,” posted
in front of Richardson dorm, takes
party-goers to and from the house,
so that people do not have to drive.

The House Itself

To get to the FIJI house at 832
Beatty Street, you take a right onto
Main Street from Glasgow. You
then take a left at the caution light,
crossing the railroad tracks, and
the gray house is on your left.

No brothers actually live at
the house, becauseit has no shower.

The house consists of a large darice
floor and bar, with two bathrooms.
There is also a foyer, couches, and
aTV. Hartley sees an added safety
factor in that, unlike Patterson
Court houses, the FIJI house has
no balcony. In addition to being
the site of their parties, the brothers
meet at the house to organize such
worthwhile services as can food
drives and working with Project
Genesis in Charlotte.

The Increased Interest

As Hartley says: “I don’tknow
what happened, but more people
have started coming to our parties
this year and last year.”

The house has parties fre-
quently, but only two or three per
semester which are advertised for
the entire campus. Hartley ex-
plains this low number by saying
that because of the small number
of brothers, “parties are a lot of
work for us.”

According to Hartley, "The
house was pretty much rocking at
their last party." In response to the
increased interest the brothers are
planning more parties.
