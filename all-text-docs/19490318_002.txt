Spring Services

Your Y.M.C.A. has set its annual Spring
Services for the week after we get back
from the holidays. As usual there. will be
six services, three in chapel on Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, and one each on those
nights in the church. The minister is: one

who has not preached to the students lately
and maybe new to most of them. He. is Dr.
George Heaton of the newly established
Myers Park Baptist Church of Charlotte.
