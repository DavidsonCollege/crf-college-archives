ers. It is said that if an appraisal
were made of the monetary value
of the complete ensemble of instru.
ments, the figure would pass the
quarter million mark. For instance,
Emil Heerman, of the first violin
section, plays a Stradivarius. And
speaking of Mr. Heerman, any com-
position by Johannes Brahms
serves to stir up fond memories of
the master for him, because when
Heerman was a boy, Brahms was
a frequent visitor to his home to
see his father, Hugo Heerman, also
a distinguished musician. While in
his home, Brahms many _ times
would seat himself at the piano.
forte and accompany Emil, then a
ten-year-old violin virtuoso.

Johnson, who became music di.
rector of the organization in 1947,
follows a long line of distinguished
musicians who haye conducted Cin-
cinnati concerts. Among the past
conductors are Victor Herbert,
Richard Strauss, Arturo Toscannini,
Andre Kostalanetz, Leopold Stok-
owski, Walter Damrosch, John
Phillip Sousa, Jose Iturbi, and a
host of others,

Born in Wisconsin, Johnson
moved to, Winston-Salem, N. C. as
a child, later attending the Univer-
sity of North Carolina. Following
further study at the University of
Michigan, and in Europe, he rose
to prominence in American music.
He was awarded an honorary de-
gree by Davidson College in 1947.

The 37-year-old conductor still
spends his summers in North Ca-
rolina and is a loyal supporter of
state musical projects. During the
last summer, he appeared as con-
ductor of the faculty symphony or-
chestra at the Transylvania Music
Camp in Brevard, N. C.

During the season, 1948-49, John.

two years ago reccived the $1,000

in the cause of contemporary Amer-
ican music.

Varsity*Athletic Manager Leads Rugged
Life Caring For Players’, Coaches’ Whims

By WOODY McKAY

Most people think he just ‘goes
along for the ride, byt they aren’t
in the know. Tlie job of chief nose-
wiper or manager of an _ athletic
team is more than it seems. If you
doubt this statement, take a gand-
er at the rest of this article.

One of the main duties of a
basketball manager, which is morc
in my line, is to keep tab on the
coach. A coach is one of the most
evasive fellows that exists. On
trips, he knows all the short cuts
by which hé can evade the rest
of the tearh which is following in
another auto. Of course, this never
happens when the followers are in
familiar territory, but always when
they are hundreds of miles from
home.

Next, a manager must always be
in an agreeable mood. When the
team loses, he must not speak to
the coach for a short time untess
he wants to draw back a nub of a
neck. When the team wins, he
must joke with the coach and tell
him how well coached the team
looked. While around him, he must
laugh at the coach's pokes and
keep him in a good mood. Finally
when at a game, the manager must
keep the’ coach from hitting the
referees and from injuring himself
in some moment of emotion when
he tries to portray an acrobat. By
adhering to these methods the man-
ager is usually a cohort of the
coach and is able to alert all play-
ers when the coach plans to “un-
expectedly” check the boys’ rooms
the night before a big game.

(Another job of the manager is
often unknown to even the coach.
This job is reporting to the men-
tor’s wife any misdemeanors of her
husband following a trip.)

And then, there are the players.
As the season lengthens from weeks
to months, the manager realizes
he is a member of a group which
portrays the hariest and horniest
specimen of manhood, namely, the
Davidson gentleman. He must be
a scholar in the field of physiologi-
cal study (called “sex” in the most
inclusive pulp magazines) by the
time the team has missed five con-

A wealthy dowager invited about
fifty soldiers from a nearby camp
to her home during World War IT.
At about 4:00 she served cookies
and lemonade. At 5:00 she served
more cookies and jemonade. Around
six she stood up and asked.

“I have just 4 more cookies left.
Now what shall 1 do with them?”

“Lmmediately a Licut. stood up
and said, “The first guy that ans-
wers that question gets the guard-
house for a week!”

A cannibal chief and his brother,
Went calling one morn on their
mother;
When they got there,
The cupboard was bare
So they simply ate up each other.

A young lady climbed up Pike's
Peak
And sat on the top for a week,
She had a deep freeze
From her chest to her knees
What a pitiful waste of physique!

AN card shark can usually be-
come a very respected manager.
Whether it is -“spank-tail hearts”
or “five card show-down,” he must
know how to handle those card-
boards. A good sense of humor
should accompany this last talent;
therefore. to put it in a few words,
a manager must be a card, deal
with cards, or be dealt with as a
result.

The taste-buds of a managerial

tongue cultivate the esthetic long-
ing for poached eggs and’ toast,
unbuttercd bread,. irish potatoes,
hot tea, and oranges:. A taste for

many types or brands of chewing

gum is suggested. Anything else
he must pay for himself. Let me
emphasize the desire for oranges.
‘He must love them so much that
he can sit down and cut dozens of
oranges at one time without tiring
in any way. This opportunity should
be taken whenever possible be.
cause it is the most he will cut up
during his term as head manager.

The, average person knows that
the manager takes care of the -uni-
forms, warm-up outfits, balls, medi-
cine kit, and a couple of other min-
or details such as the A. A. car.
This becomes routine after a few

weeks, and he learns to fold up
easily during that time.

But, there are many _ things
learned on this tour of duty as a
manager. To mention a few of
these, I would say he learns alt
the scenic (and otherwise) parts of
the cities to which he travels, how
to juggle figures with the oppos-

‘ing’ scorekeepers (note to prospec-

tive junior bank executives), to
leave a small amount of space in
liis overnight bag for hotel soap,
stationery and other necessities,
how to deal with “Doc White,
and he learns to covet the exper-
iences he had in traveling with a
swell bunch of boys.

Frats At Duke
Whoop It Up
Tad Too Much

Three Duke fraternities received
social probation status when the
IFC executive council ruled that
they had violated University social
rules, /

Lambda Chi Alpha, Phi Delta
Theta and Sigma Alpha Epsilon
were found guilty of holding il.
legal parties Saturday night, Feb.
{7, immediately following the close
of fraternity rushing. fhe execu-

‘tive committee placed Lambda Chi

on social probation until May 1,
SAE until April 15, and Phi Delt
until April 1.

University rules which the three
fraternities violated state that a
fraternity function must be signed
up with the university and chaper-
ones must be present and that no
drinking shall be allowed at a fra-
ternity function.

Jack Blackburn, IFC president,
explained that the executive com-
mittee levied the penalties in view
of an IFC regulation that frater-
nities shalt abide by University
social ‘rules. ;

Blackburn, in announcing the de-
cisions of his group stated, “It is
evident that a number of people on
our campus don't feel the rule is
satisfactory. However, none of
these people made an_ effort to
change the rules before breaking
them; and when a rule is broken,
we have to enforce it as long as
the rule stands.”

In commenting on the outcome
of the situation, SAF. president, A.
J. Brock said, “It is unfortunate
that there are not enough estab-
lishments in Durham and Chapel
Hill to take care of 20 fraternities,

NBC Declares Boys
“Sang Beautifully’’

The Davidson Male Chorus has
réceived high praise from the Na-
tional Broadcasting, Company for
its excellent choral program which
was broadcast to a nationwide ra-
dio audience over NBC last Satur-
day afternoon. In a letter to Dr.
Cunningham, Mr. Ernest LaParade,
NBC's Director of Mysic Research,
expressed his regret that Dr. Cun-
ningham was unable to be ‘present
for the broadcast to deliver his
personal message to the radio au-
dience as was originally intended,
and he said he thought the boys
“sang beautifully and reflected
great credit on their Alma Mater.”
In conclusion, Mr. LaParade said
that NBC is looking forward to
future opportunities to present the
Davidson Male Chorus to the radio
audience.

asked him to judge cigarette mildness by taking one puff, one huff, one whiff or

one sniff. Our common sense friend enjoys a good smoke too much ever to

settle on any brand in such a snap-judgment way! For him and for millions

like him, there’s only one convincing way to test cigarette mildness.
It’s the Sensible Test... the 30-Day Camel Mildness Test,
which simply asks you to try Camels as your steady smoke

—on a pack after pack, day after day basis. No snap judgments

needed! After you’ve enjoyed Camels—and only Camels—

for 30 days in your “T-Zone” (T for Throat, T for Taste),

we believe you will know why ...

More People Smoke Camels

than any other cigarette!
