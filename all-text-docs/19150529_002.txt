EDITORIAL.

Commencement has ended. ‘The girls
have left, the fellows have gone, and the
campus is deserted and quiet as these
words are being pounded out on the
typewriter. That this issue may tel
those who did not attend Commence-
- ment, of its pleasures, and remind those
who were present of their pleasures,
that it may be a permanent record of the
days just past, for the Seniors just gone,
and the friends who came to see them
go, that it may make you more loya
than ever to Davidson's weekly, to Dav-
idson College and to the plans and
ideals set for her next year—this is the
hope of those who have financed this
special issue, and of those who have
stayed over to send it out.

ALUMNI FLOCK TO
SUPPORT OF DAVIDSONIAN

Nothing is more gratifying to the
editors and managers of ‘Tne Davin-
soniAN than the wav in which the
alumni are coming to the support: of the
paper. Qnly one man approached on
the campus this Commencement refused
to subscribe. All others were hearty in
appreciation of the paper and = came
across at once with the long green. “THe
DavivsoniaAn can boast of being unique
among college weeklies in the support it
receives from the alumni. ;

GIGNILLIAT WINS SIGNAL
LITERARY HONOR

The Blue Pencil Club learned last
week that one of its members, G.
Gignilliat, won first place in the An-
nual Prose Fiction Contest conducted
by the Sigma Upsilon National Literary
Fraternity. Fifteen’ universities an
colleges were represented in this con-
test, and .so the honor is a signal one.
The stories sent in were submitted to
three judges, who graded them care-
fully according to definite standards.
Gignilliat received the highest grade,
with Newman of North Carelina, com-
ing second. The prize for the winner
of this contest is a Sigma Upsilon ring.

Gignilliat’s prize-winning. story was
entitled “Ihe Prisoner of Gerada.” It
appeared in practically the same form
in the. January-February Magazine, un-
der the title ‘“Choughts."” In the judg-
ment of many competent critics, it ts
one of the most perfect short stories
that has ever been written at Davidson.

WEDNESDAY PROGRAM

(Concluded from page 1)

That Davidson still claims Dr. Smich
as her own, although jhe has moved to
another State. was evidenced by the en-
thusiastic ovation which he received as
he stood to speak.

‘The subject-of his address was “A
Widespread Campus. Fallacy.” The
fallacious campus creed which he sought
to expose was, that to attain success in
the herce warfare of modern business
demands _ self-confidence, _ red-blooded
vitality and a knowledge of men and
things rather than “book learning” and
abstract scholarship. In fact ,it is gen-
erally believed that the students who
make the highest marks are not so apt to
win promotion and success in the mod-
ern world as the all-round man who
strives only after fair grades, and is
thereby enabled to participate more vig-
orously in the many organized activities
of the college. Loe

By means of clear and convincing sta-
tistics Dr. Smith proved that wages are
all the better for the educational train-
ing received and increase in direct pro-
motion to it.
Holding for a moment the ‘“Who’s
Who” edition of tg911 in his hand, the
speaker ridiculed in a few sentences the
advertising biographies of some current
great men, for which as much as $150
apiece are paid, then referring to ‘Who's
Who” of “Cold facts, not eulogy,” he
presented the following figures: Of
the one million and three-fourths illit-
erates in the United States. not one has
his name in “Who's Who.” Of twelve
million men of common school training
one in 9,000 is so honored, of 650,000

men, finally have one chance in 40 to
enter this roll of distinction.
Figures from Yale, Harvard, Prince-

d|ton, Amherst and Brown showed that

men who take honors in college take
onors in later life. The continued ap-
plause at the close of Dr. Smith’s mas-
terful address indicated that he had
proved his point to the satisfaction of
the audience.

MEDALS AWARDED.

Dr. Martin presented the debating
trophy cup to the Eumenean Society,
which won it this vear over the Philan-
thropic. "
Three medals were then awarded.

medal for highest honors in the three
vear Bible course to W. A. McIlwaine.
“There is one man of the six splendid
speakers that we wish to pat on the
back—Mr. Patton,” said Rev. ‘TP.
Burgess, in declaring J. G. Patton the
winner of the Junior Oratorical con-
test. Vhe Faculty Orators’ medal to
the winner of the Senior contest was
presented to Norman Johnson.
