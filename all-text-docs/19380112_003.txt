Is Speaker
In Charlotte

“Rubbing Off the Price Mark”
Is the Subject of Dr.
Foreman’s Talk

Dr. Kenneth J. Foreman was
guest minister Sunday at the
St. Paul Presbyterian Church
ot Charlotte. He also spoke to
the Young People during the
Sunday School hour.

Dr. Foreman took as his text the
24th verse of the 24th chapter of
2nd Samuel: “The King said, I will
buy it of thee at a price, neither
will I offer burnt offerings to the
Lord

my God of that which doth
cost me nothing.” The subject of
his sermon was “Rubbifig off the

Mark.”

listed by Dr. Foreman—praver,

and giving is haphazard and serv-

carries, then we have a cheap brand
of religion, and ‘matter what
price tag we mark on it, in time of

“We can't fool God. We
even fool ourselves. So long as we
