Pithy Irreverence ... Sean Lind

"IT Hab a Coad;" How Sean Deals When His Body's Down

Intelligence reports warned of
an imminent enemy attack. I be-
gan tonotice signs ofitall around.
People were coughing; they were
snifffing; they were pale. The Flu
was on the offensive.

I set up my defenses. Exer-
cise on the right flank. Check.
Balanced diet with plenty of fruits
and vegetables on the left. Roger.
Plenty of sleep straightahead. Aye-
Aye.

I was fine for a while, and
cocky. Sickness is for the weak, 1
thought. Then, alittle sniffle here,
alittle cough there. Somehow, the
enemy had breached the perim-
eter. I was determined to fight
with every ounce of my being. By
force of will, I, The Mighty Sean,
would triumph and remain healthy.
As the battle raged, however, I
realized that I was hopelessly
outgunned. I was being attacked
from all sides - my head hurt, my

backached, Icoughed. Ihadplaned
off half my nose with Kleenex.

(‘But there’s still plenty to go

around,” says my funny roommate
- Oh, ha, ha, he, ho!) Still, I re-
mained on my feet, defending
myself against the foe. After all,
this is Davidson, and I had no time
to be sick.

I tried Comtrex, Thera-Flu,
Anti-Cold, Omni-Sick - just about
every cure on the market. I drank
so much citrus, that if someone had
squeezed me, I would have peed
juice. ButI still felt myself getting
sick.

So I went the other direction.
I tried partying - drinking and
smoking and lots of extreme
changes in temperature, hoping that
my body would become a toxic
environment and whatever viruses
that were inhabiting it would flee
for their lives, like rats leaving a
sinking ship. But that didn’t work

either.

My body started telling me
“Sleep. Sleep would be good.” I
didn’ tlisten, because lam opposed
to naps. A little aversion left over
from my preschool days, perhaps.

Then, my body got pissed.
“SLEEP!,” it yelled, punctuating
this with a neat flashy, dizzy spell.
Discretion proved the better ‘part
of valor, and I resolved to concede
defeat and retreat to the warmth of
my bed.

I dreamt of lilac ducks. Ihave
no idea why.

Sometime early Friday morn-
ing I awoke shaking like an epilep-
tic. Who let in the Arctic? I was
freezing cold, and yet had a fever
of like 108°. Obviously, I had
contracted malaria.

Anyway, to make a long ill-
ness short, I got better. Time was
the only thing that could cure me.

And now that I’m a veteran, I

feel qualified to expound weight-
ily onmy experience. Here’s some
interesting things about colds:

Sickness reduces people to
their lowest common denomina-
tor. It’s completely impossible to
have a metaphysical crisis when
you’re sick as a dog.: ““What’s the
meaning of life?” Whocares? Just
let me get rid of this headache and
keep down some solid food.

Paradoxically, I find thatwhen
I’m sick, I become more religious.
“Dear God, I know I haven’t spo-
ken to you since exams, but could
you please make this stuffy nose
go away?”

When you’re sick, life sucks.
Colds are a double whammy at
Davidson: First, they cut down
productivity, making it impossible
todo the mountain of work you’ ve
been procrastinating. Second, as if
it wasn’t already hard enough to
get play at Davidson, colds reduce

your social prowess toa minimum.
It’s hard to be a charmer with snot
running down your face.

But now that I’m healthy
again, I’ve decided being sickisn’t
sobad. Sure, you feel likecrap, but
look on the bright side:

You can sit around on the
couch all day and justify it to your-
self, your professors, and your par-
ents. You can’t work - you’re
sick.

If you can figure out how to
adjust the dosages of Sudafed,
NyQuil and Robutussin just right,
you can be flying like a kite ‘till
you land on the other side of ill.

Best of all, if you play it up
enough, you can enjoy the sympa-
thy of all your friends. Sniff alot,
shuffle around, and moan. Works
like a charm.

So enjoy the cold and flu sea-
son, kids!

Sexism Not
The Issue

_ By Patrick Jopling &
Ryan Harper

Last year a scandal-ridden
Clemson University basketball
program was in search of a new
coach, The man they wanted was
Terry Holland, whom they offered
nearly one million dollars a year.
The name Holland is widely re-
spected and synonymous with in-
tegrity in the sports community.
His name has been mentioned for
almost every coaching vacancy in
the past three years, including Ken-
tucky, yet he has remained com-
mitted to serving his alma mater.
In the past few weeks, he has re-
ceived criticism from a faculty
immersed solely in academics.

The decision made by Hol-
land to rent out Belk Arena was
meant to generate extra revenue
for 4 deficit-stricken athletic de-
partment, not as a sexist act. It is
unfortunate that the game had to be
canceled due to an apparent mis-
understanding, however the $4500
user’ s fee has been promised to the
women’s basketball program. .

The benefits Terry Holland
has brought to Davidson are innu-
merable. He has brought back
several women’s sports. He brings
instant credibility to Davidson
sports which helps with recruiting
and publicity.

He playeda vital role in bring-
inginthe NCAA Soccer Final Four
and will continue to have a posi-
tive effecton Davidson. Holland
ranks among the leaders of NCAA
members. It isa shame this recent
incident has overshadowed his ac-
complishments.

Professors David Martin and
Mary Anne Moore’s request that
the money be given to academic
affairs is unwarranted, irrelevant,
and just plain ludicrous. By using
The Observer, they generated un-
due negative press for the college.
It seemsas if they could shown the
courtesy to have handled the affair
within the college community.

Misrepresentation Plagues the Media

By Marilyn Ambroise

Television playsa vital role in
the lives ofall Americans. Whether
or not you watch television, you
are still affected by it. Over the
years, there have been many
changes in the television world.
However, the misrepresentation
and under-representation of mi-
norities has remained constant.
This poor representation can be
found in all branches of the media.
Among the primary examples are
news, commercials, and movies.

Let us first consider the news.
It is very common to see an ac-
cused African-American male in
handcuffs, or, if we don’t see him,
we are given the description of “a
black male in his teens.” One has
to wonder if this leads us to believe
that only people of that description
commit crimes.

Think deeply before you put
on your retaliating gloves. Crimes
committed by Caucasians and pre-
sented on the news can be easily
rendered as abnormal by our soci-
ety. Clear.cases are those of Ted
Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer, cases
which the media had no problem
exposing to the public. What this
says to society is that these men do
not represent Caucasians.

Further, this representation
suggests that it is unusual for nor-

mal Caucasians to commit crimes
and that these men are only excep-
tions to that rule. This leads to the
conclusion that only abnormal
Caucasians commit crimes.

On the other hand, the news
sends subliminal messages to so-

ciety. Often these imply that it is -

normal for African-Americans,
especially males, tocommitcrimes.
The news introduces African-
American males ascommoncrimi-
nals. Only on rare occasions are
African-Americans praised rather
than represented as really weird.
The news suggests, then, that
crimes commited by African-
Americans are not rare and that
noteworthy actions on their part
are.

Secondly, ask yourself how
many minorities you have seen in
commercials. Not many, huh?
Only the less than observant per-
son would arrive at a different an-
swer. Minorities are rarely given
more than parts in fast-food com-
mercials or those that are related to
housekeeping.

Infomercials may be even
worse: Ask yourself how many
minorities you have seen testify to
being ex-drug addicts or AIDS
patients. It was not until recently

Gull's Nest...

Who Says Davidson
is Conservative?

The myth that Davidson is a
conservative place is false.

Several weekends ago I jour-
neyed to Washington D.C. for the
Young America’s Foundation Stu-
dent Leadership Seminar. Y AF is
an organization that sponsors con-
servative speakers at colleges
across the coun-

tive speaker on campus this year
(something I hope-to change). Big
bucks were doled out to Spike Lee,
and everyone was shocked that he
would come to sucha conservative
school. Thereare radical left-wing
viewpoints in this paper every
week. There are committees for

minority inter-

try. There were
about ten other
students there
who told_horror
stories about epi-
sodes ofextreme
political correct-
ness on their
campuses. I
thought for a
while and was
proud that
Davidson is not
like that. Our
speech is not re-
stricted, there is
no thought po-
lice here, and

Bill Gullan

ests, an SGA
advocate for
women, a gen-
der-inclusive
language sheet
handed out in
most classes.
Our two SGA
presidential
candidates
both listed di-
versity as their
top priority.
There is noth-
ing wrong
with these
things, but it
just goes to

one is free to ex-
press anything.

Davidson is

Our rights are
protected. The director then asked
me if Davidson is a conservative
school. I was forced to say no.

Conservatism can be separated
into two parts: politics and instincts.
When it comes to politics, nobody
in their right (pardon the pun) mind
would say that Davidson isa right-
wing institution. The faculty is
predictably liberal; the students
are pretty split. Clinton won the
campus election, the battle of the
bumper stickers, and the door war.
A large group of students went to
see Clinton speak, while only a
handful went with me tosee Ronald
Reagan. That doesn’t really mat-
ter, though. There is a healthy (and
relatively even) political dialogue
here.

Instincts are a different story.
There has not been one conserva-

not conserva-

tive. The curriculum is still struc-
tured, yet “victims” studies”
courses seem to be popping up.
The school seems to be changing.
I think many of these reforms

are wonderful. I love Davidson. It
is not Berkeley or Oberlin. How-
ever, maybe it would be more fair
if there were more conservative

“speakers, and if the conservative

element of the community spoke
up.
Davidson is a moderate
school. It is more conservative
than the Ivy League, but less con-
servative than most southern
schools.

Let’s make sure everyone’s
rights are protected and all voices
are heard.

Bill Gullan is a Republican.
