Tenure: ‘Christians Only’

By TODD EADES
Contributing Editor

The question of tenure is for-
cing the college to review its
position as a Christian in-
stitution and as an academic in-
Stitution.

Who shall receive tenure un-
der what conditions is the
salient question, but the more
important question is how the
college defines’ its Christian
commitment.

The current debate involves a
sentence in the Board of
Trustee By-laws which
reads,“‘Any Faculty member
given tenure must be an active
member of a Christian church."
The purpose of this restriction
apparently is to sustain the
Christian commitment of
Davidson College as it is found
in the Statement of Purpose. in-
cluded in the college catalog.

The positions taken on this
sentence will concern the best
way to preserve the college's
academic excellence as well as
its Christian commitment.

When Samuel R. Spencer Jr.
became president in 1969 he
established a commission to
study Davidson College's chur-
ch relations. That commission,
composed of trustees, faculty,
and students, found that ‘‘chur-
ch relatedness" has a negative
side for many members of the
community, due largely to legal
strictures originating in the
Board of Trustees.

The commission report
asks,"‘Does the Board of
Trustees, a larg majority of
whose members are elected
from and by the Presbyteries,
represent the church or the
college?”

Twenty-six of the forty-two
members of the Board are elc-
ted by and from supporting
Presbyteries. Futhermore, the
only official church relationship
that the Presbyterian Church
has to the college is in the elec-

uon of Trustees.

The report cites the leader-
ship offered by the church and
also lists several instances that
Davidson College did not
respond affirmatively to the
recommendations of the
General Assembly of the Presb-
teria Church, U.S. for a number
of years.

However, the commission
strongly recommends, and im-
plicitly assumes throughout its
report, that the college main-
tain its church relationship.

Regarding tenure as a means
of securing this commitment,
the commission recomends
“that the formal religious
requirements for members of

the faculty and administration
be deleted."

In reaching that conclusion
the commission contacted eight
church related schools which
reported no religious restric-
tions on faculty.

To maintain a Christian com-
mitment the commission recom-
mends that whoever hires
faculty inform prospective
professors of the Christian aim
of the college and that the
college satisfy itself that the
prospective faculty member be
willing ‘‘conscientiously and
wholeheartedly to teach in a
community having these aims.”’

The idea that an informal

commitment is not only

suggested in the three year old
commission report, but is sup-
ported by many faculty and ad-
ministrators now. Brown Pat-
terson, Professor of History and
an ordained Episcopal priest,
believes that the college should
‘do away with all formal
religious requirements for
tenure."’

Several professors, including
some who did not wish to be
quoted on this issue, stressed the
need for dialogue and the duty of
a an academic institution to be
open to all opinions. But none of
the questioned the maintainence
of the religious commitment of
the College.

Professor of theology Alexan-

methodof maintainingChristian der J. McKelway said that the

absence of religious restrictions
would be ‘‘an expression of the
openness, freedom, and se-
curity of the Christian com-
mitment of the college."

Professor of philosophy Earl
R. MacCormac called the rule
‘denial of academic freedom”
and said-the college should seek
to develop responsible freedom.
Academic Affairs John M.
Bevan stated that if the restriv-
tion were dropped the college
would not change so much, and
that it would be the responsibility
of the President and himself to
maintain the ingredienis of a

good community. Bevan
stressed the need ‘‘to be
challenged as_ well = as

SGA Considers Policy On New Union,
Places Coed On Student Life Committee

By TOM AINSWORTH
News Editor

Tuesday night's SGA Senate
meeting was considered ‘‘very
good" by SGA President Ralph
Peeples. as he referred to its
clearing up of old items on the
agenda and its speed in
deliberation.

The most significant order of
business. according to Peeples.
was the proposal to place a

Scott Meets Leaders
To Discuss Service

By MIKE TANNER
Asst. Managing Editor

Slater Food Director Ron
Scott. will meet with the ad-
ministration and student
leaders today to discuss recent
claims about inadequacies in
the food service

Scott hinted that a possible
solution tor a 20 meal plan tor
interested students could be
worked out

“We're not: going to say to
anyone that he can't get enough
to eat at) Davidson College
Well) work something out.”
Scott said

According to Scott. the
present system of paying only
for what one eats was instituted
on the basis that in the past two
years, students have claimed
only 63 percent of the meals en-
titled to them

Also, in -response to com-
plaints that one cannot eat as
much as last year for the same
price, Scott explained that the
actual cost of food has risen
only slightly but. because of the
new meal tickets. those sudents
who eat fewer than 15 meals per
week won't be paying to allow
other students to eat more than
15 meals per week

*‘Last year, only the student
eating 14 meals per week was
consuming exactly what he
paid for. T.H problem here is

that those who ate 20 meals per
week last vear thought that they
were able to do so for $600 when
they really might have eaten
$750 worth of food. all of this at
the expense of the light eaters.
“So our prices have not risen
very much,” Scott said.

Thus. the kev to the new svs—
tem is the projection that over
the vear, the average amount of
food consumed by the student
will be in the 15 meal range;
this allows Slater to operate in
the black financially and = the
board figure to remain around
$600

‘We're trying to keep the
board fee down because I don't
think the typical student needs
pay much more than the pre—
sent figure.” said Scott

The Stater people feel that the
new system is thus fairer to the
individual student but admit
that: they might have un-
derestimated ‘the number of
students eating close to 20
meals per week.

Scott implied that perhaps a
reversal to the ID card meal
ticket might be a possibility, but
he made it clear that this was
only one of the many
possibilities.

woman on the Student Life
Committee in an ex-officio
capacity.

The motion, brought up by co-
ed representative Katie Early.
was passed unanimously.

In another major econ-
sideration. Senate Vice-
President Bob Cunningham
stressed a need for the Senate to
define its position in regard to
ideas for new Union facilities.

Citing Union Director C
Shaw Smith's present question-
naire asking students for their
views on necessary components
for a Union, Cunningham ex-
pressed an opinion for a
building ‘‘big enough for future
expansion."

Duff Bruce. Assistant to the
President, felt that the main
concern was not in building a
new Union, but other special
considerations. such as
location, permanency, and
relevance to student activities.

Final consideration on the
Union plans was postponed for
further discussion.

MID-MEETING CONFERENCE
Ralph Peeples and Steve Suflas discuss a point of order.

Another plan for Senate con-
sideration, introduced by Rob
Krebbs, called for a develop-
ment of the Lake Campus area,
notably a proposed $15,000 boat
house and paved entranceway.
plus an overall expansion of the
Intramural sports program.

The plan comes from new In-
tramural sports director Chip
Stone, who seeks to spend most
of his annually allotted budget
by this November on such
projects.

A previously tabled motion on
the attendance requirements
for Senators passed
unanimously.

Under it, Senate members
would be liable for im-
peachment proceedings for
failure of duty, of which at-
tendance is a part.

A constitutional admendment
also passed unanimously
whereby SGA Senators could be
recalled by 20 percent of their
residential constituency and
replaced by a majority vote in
make-up elections.

Concerning a faculty com-
mittee on the subsidization of
football, Cunningham
remarked that he considered it
‘a good idea, but one which
might want to wait.

‘After season would probably
be a better time for opinions,
when everyone has an idea on
the matter,” he continued.

Two final items, considered
for referral to the Residence
Hall Council, had to do with the
lack of telephone service in the

dorms and the janitorial
situation.
The latter was especially

alluded to by Peeples. who
stated that some of the longer
standing custodians were ‘‘let
go without even compensation”
by the college, and that the
present janitorial service was
wholly inadequate.

Peeples reminded Senators of
the Student Government Elec-
tions to be held Tuesday, Oct.
10. Peeples noted that the date
for filing closed at 5 p.n. yester-
day.
