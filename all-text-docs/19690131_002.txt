About That Question

If we'd asked about faculty salaries,
we probably wouldn’t have gotten as
colorful a response as we did when
we asked, on last week’s faculty ques-
tionnaire, about the admission policy
of minority group students.

The question was, do you favor ad-
mitting larger numbers of minority
group students who are quailfied
under present admission standards?
And the answers...

A. couple of profs chomped down

Boredom Curb

Last fall we called attention to a
psychologist’s survey on _ lectures
which showed, among other things,
that a vast majority of.today’s under-
graduates don’t even listen in class.

Matter of fact, the study revealed
that a comparable number of students
are as likely to be thinking about sex
as listening to the professor. (The
percentage given was 20 percent in
each catagory).

One of the conclusions from this
would seem to be that most lectures
are dull, and, though we didn’t dare
mention it last fall, perhaps this ap-
plies at Davidson as well.

All need not be bleak, though, if
Davidson were to implement a custom
practiced at at least one northern
school, lectures would surely pass sex
as an attention-holder.

In the first place, class attendance
at this school is voluntary, thereby
giving a professar an added incentive
to be interesting. More important,
however, is. the fact that anytime a
student gets bored, he can walk out
of class — without being penalized.
Certainly a true indicator of a lec-
ture’s worth. —

We need a similar set-up here. We
need more informative, challenging
lectures. We need our minds on the
liberal arts and the sciences — not
sex.

Even our conservative Presbyter-
ian forebearers would agree to that.

on us for asking a “vague” and/or
“irrelevant” question. They asserted
that the question implies that the col-
lege has been turning away this kind
of student, which is, of course, not
true.

Most faculty members, though, be-
nevolently assumed that we aren’t
totally ignorant and interpreted the
question another way, the way we in-
tended it — ie., should the college
more actively seek out the minority
group students?

Listen to what some of them said:

—‘“Only if sufficiently good ones
are interested. Look at what we've
gotten so far! ! Do you read the news
papers? Do you know any such group
that appreciates its opportunities in
other schools?”

—“Of course. American Indians,
gypsies, Jews, mountain whites, blacks
and everybody.”

—““Yes (underlined twice)—which
means getting out and recruiting
them professionally.”

—“If they are qualified why are
they not admitted? The problem seems
to be one of recruitment, which David-
son very greatly neglects.”

With those last two professors we
agree completely. We are sorely lack-
ing minority group students, to be
sure, but te charge the admissions
office with neglect or half-hearted-
n¢The admissions 1 say th

e ons personnel say they
walified

studenta and few of them here.

The salution seems te us, as to
many faculty members (S8 out of 45
returning questionnaires favor admit-
ting more qualified minority group
students), to be a matter of recrui
ing. Go out after those students with
earnest. Bust a gut to get them.

To the recruited students and the
college, it would be worth a major
shift in the college's financial priori-
ties.

Candidates’ Crimes

We shudder to think how many
trees were cut down to produce the
paper for candidates’ platforms. It is
a crime against nature to deforest
America in order to print such drivel.

Platforms for this week’s Senate
and YMCA elections were the epitome
of mee-tooism, good-guyism and out-
right personality contesting.

Most platforms were appropriately
posted in bathrooms. If it weren’t for
urinals none of the candidates would
have gotten any votes. But they do
provide comic retief.

There is no point in THE DAVID
SONIAN saving those Senate plat-
forms to see if the candidates keep
their promises—they made no sub-
stantial proniises and took no posi-
tions, except for some broad and ill-
defined ones.

Canditates this year campaigned on
the basis of “honor” and “responsi-
bility." Some would occasionally go

out on a limb :md promise to attend
all the meetings.

Campaign technique was character-
ized by the broad generality and wide
smile. They might as well have prom-
ised to go to the Post Office every

ay.

One would think that the supposed-
ly intelligent, perceptive and discern-
ing students of Davidson College
would demand more of their candi-
dates for elective office.

The situation this year points out
the disarray into which student gov-
ernment has fallen. The most able
men must not be running for the Sen-

ate, for surely the most able men at

Davidson would have something more
to say in their platforms than this
year’s substandard fare.

Hopefully the new senators can
overcome this early case’ of verbal
diarhhea and produce some more

‘thoughtful graffitti.

The Meaning Of War

From The Chapel! Hill Weekly

The lady had come in to submit for
publication a note of thanks to those
who had tried to share her family's
grief.

Her son had been killed in Vietnam
several weeks before. The Christmas
holidays had come and gone singe
that wrenching hews arrived. Now
she was picking up the threads of her
life again and must have been trying
desperately to return to the old famil-
jar patterns. But the grief was still
etched deeply in her face.

She spoke haltingly, almost pain-
fullv, about how thoughtful people
had been. Her face was working and
she was trying hard to hold back the
tears. By now tears must have be-
come a regular part of her days and
nights.

When she had gotten it all said, or
most of it, she turned quickly and
hurried out, heading blindly for the
front door. Broken again.

And it was at that moment that the
tragedy of the Vietnam War, of all
war, became real. Yesterday Vietnam
had been national policy and enlight-
ened national self-interest and halting
aggression and self-determination for
the free people of the world, and may-
be it would be all those things again
tomorrow. But at that moment it was
only raw tragedy. The debate in Paris
over the size and shape of the confer-
ence table and whether the peace
talks would be three-sided, four-sided,
or whatever suddenly was roaring in-
sanity. The ludicrousness of Strom
Thurmond and Curtis LeMay and the
other red-eyed hawks calling for “total
victory” all at once was clear and un-

deniable.

It had been a long time coming,
but finally there was understanding
that no war can ever be won, there is
no victory in war, only comparative
losses.

The thought occurred then that the
lady who had brought in the note of
thanks should be given a seat at the
Paris Conference table. As a constant
reminder of what war really means,
she might give some impetus to the
search for peace.

Lively Corpse

From Raleigh comes the word:
James Gardner is not dead.

The state’s number one Republican
vote-getter isn’t even resting, in- fact.
From the way he’s been acting of
late, you’d never know he lost the
gubernatorial race last November.

That November defeat was the nar-
rowest in recent state history, if you
recall, and having victory snatched
away from him has apparently just
made Gardner want it more... so
much so that his Raleigh political
headquarters is still open for business
and buzzing.

Gardner's got a lot going for him—
youth, but enough gray hairs to make
him appear mellow; a smooth—albeit
slightly forked tongue; sex appeal;
a well-oiled organization; and support-
ers. About the only thing James Gard-
ner seems to lack, in fact, is some-
thing to run for.

May we suggest grand dragon of
the state klan?

Anti - ROTC Group
Talks To Trustees

ED. NOTE: The following
statement was presented to
the Executive Board of the,
Board of Trustees on Jan.
16. The four signees, repre-
senting the Ad Hoc Commit-
fee for Voluntary ROTC
were invited to the mecting
by President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr.

There are three closely
related points which we
think are highly relevant to
the question of voluntary
ROTC.

The first of these involves
the mora! issue of an indi.
vidua) becoming a part of
an organization which is de-
dicated to taking the lives
of other human beings. Par
ticipation in such an organi
nization involves actions
which are highly question
able to anyone committed to
the Christian faith. |

We do not think that a
Christian oriented liberal
arts school should force its
students in any one direction
on such a question which in-
volves a very personal, mor.
al decision.

Secondly, we think the
question of academic free-
dom is of central import-
ance. We refer mainly to the
Blue Sky Committee, report
which emphasizes student
decision making under a
flexible curriculum. We do

not think that compulsory.

ROTC is. in keeping with that
report.

In fact. (se original report
states:--"ROIC will be made

‘Post’ Mortem; |

Memory Stays

By ROBERT PYEATT
Asseciate Editor

The Saturday Evening Post, once a popular Tues-
day publication, has turned into one of the mere mem-
ories on which it once thrived.

The Pest was notable for a long time because it

was a relic of an America

of Ben
Norman Rockwell covers.

Post just kept on like it had
Franklin's editorship

The passing of the Post is

indicative of the passing of
rural America. The Poet had
gotten too far behind the
times too fast, and the edito-
rial convulsions it suffered
trying to catch up only wor-
sened its condition.

The parent company, Cur-
tis Publishing, tried to keep
it alive by rapidly switching
from the rural to the racy
in the last few years. But
the splashy layouts always
looked a little phony on the
staid old Post, and the efforts
to produce hard-hitting. in-
cisive articles lacked depth.

‘Nobody under fifty cared
for those homely _ serials
about tractor salesmen. Its
readers were the first vic-
tims of the generation gap as
it became far more popular
in geriatric wards than pedia-
trician's offices.

When the present genera-
tion of Davidson students
were young, the Post consist-
ed mostly of hammy _ inter-
views with movie stars and
sports figures. with an oc-
casional analysis of some
newsworthy event that had
occurred six months earlier.

The lesson to be learned
is that rural America is be-
ing passed by. This country
is now cosmopolitan, urban
and moving far and fast
from the small towns that
were once the heart of a
growing nation.

Graham: Responsibility Is
More Potent Than Coercion

To The Editor:

The recent columns of Bob
Reid and. Charles McEwen
dealing with government call
for some comment.

Reid and McEwen make
one enlightening assertion
about the student govern.
ment — and only one. That
is that Davidson's student
government is not a true
government, for, in Reid's
words, it ‘has neither final
authority nor ultimate con-
trol over (the) situation.”

However, Reid is quick to
confuse the issue by quoting
Ray Mungo: ‘Student lead-
ers do not exist, because
they lack ultimate authority
and ultimate control.”

But is it necessary that a
man have ultimate power in
order that he be considered
a leader?

There are, in fact, a great
many leaders who do not
have ultimate power, as well
as a great many organiza-
tions which do not, but
which nevertheless accom.
plish a great deal.

McEwen says, “At best,
student ‘government’ can
only be a lobbying force, an
organized group that will

pressure the faculty who in
turn will pressure the trus-
tees. This pressure, this co.
ercion, is the power that
that brings about change on
this campus."

He goes on to show that
all the important changes in
Davidson life have been
brought about by the use of
defiant pressure.

He argues that drinking on
campus was allowed because
of the pressure of student
abuses: ‘Student niggers
tirst showed their power of
coercion by flagrantly dis-
obeying the faculty's drink-
ing rule. And the administra.
tion really couldn't excer-
cise their power for the rule’s
enforcement.” .

But if this sort of student
pressure has so effectively
brought about change in col-
lege policy on vespers,
drinking on campus and
open dorms, as McEwen as-
serts, why has it taken 129
years of abuses to end ves-
pers, 131 years to institute
drinking, and 131 years to
establish open dorms?

The evidence seems rath
er to indicate that student
abuses were not the decid.

ing cause.

A more likely cause in the
case of the last two is the
formation of a body to re-
gulate these institutions.
Open dorms and drinking on
campus would not have been
ratified without the forma-
tion of the Residence Hall
Association.

We owe these changes to
increase of student responsi-
bility rather than to con.
tinued student irresponsibi-
lity.

I do not wish to blow up
out of proportion the impor.
tance of McEwen’s column
since few people take DA-
VIDSONIAN columns. seri-
ously.

But hypothetically speak-
ing. if anyone were to make
a concerted effort to follow
McEwen’s program for
change, it is unlikely that
the resulting distrust be-
tween the student body and
the administration and trus.
tees would bring about any
more true progress at Da-
vidson than did the first 130
years of Davidson's history.

sponsible maturity is more
likely to develop when a
member of the college com
munity is both free and ob-
ligated to wrestle with prin.
ciples of conduct and to ac.
cept full responsibility for his
own actions and decisions."

It is our feeling that com.
pulsory ROTC is not in keep
ing with this concept of re.
sponsible student decision
making.

We feel that a voluntary
program can be set up at
Davidson. Such a program
would include an intensive
orientation program at the
beginning of the freshman
year with presentations for
and against ROTC. If the
program 1s truly voluntary,
it should also include the
provision that a student
could withdraw from the
program at any time that
he made such a decision.

In short is our contention
that compulsory ROTC vio
lates the basic concepts of
both the Blue Sky Commit.
tee and CRAP reports, that
it hampers the student in
making a moral! decision of
utmost importance. °

The above represents in
our minds a very valid po
sition. We have therefore de.
cided to hold an open forum
in the Spring to present both
this view in more detail and
to raise questions about
whether students should en.

We would lke to invite
you, the members of the
Trustee Executive Commit-

tee, to participate in thot

dents in not only the realm

That Dastardly Exam Proposal

Thank heavens the faculty had the good sense

to reject that dastardly self-scheduled exams proposal.
If this proposal went into effect, then most students
would probably take their examinations as soan as pos
sible, leaving their poor professors behind to grade
papers during vacation.

During this time the faculty could be writing great
scholarly works, enhancing their reputation and that
of the school. Grading a flood of papers would rob
them of valuable writing time.

__ “Geez, | sure am glad the self-scheduling notion
didn’t pass,” said Irving Snerd, director of the David-
son College Press.

_ “Why, think of it, a world deprived of David-
soniana and robbed of great works written by that
community of scholars! All that loss, just so a bunch
of long-haired, spoiled brats can get an education the
easy way.” .

“More vacation,” he shrieked! “Why, don’t you
know that more evil takes place after mid-term. Keep
“em busy. Besides, police at resorts have such a control
problem during vacation that it’s our duty to help with
security by keeping students occupied. Neighbors com-
plain of the holiday noise.”

_ Another professor pointed out a more serious
deficiency in the proposal. “Why, do you realize that
in paragraph 3, subsection seven, the author of the
plan failed to place a comma in its proper place. That
made the entire subsection very confusing and inar-
ticulate. Students who don’t know their comma rule
should spend more time in the classroom, not at va-
cation spots.”

_ Thank goodness the faculty killed once and for all
this ridiculous notion. And everyone knows that the
best way to kill a proposal is to give it to a committee
for further study.
