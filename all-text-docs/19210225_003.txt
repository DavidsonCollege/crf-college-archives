The Beetles met in the P. K. A. hall on
Wednesday night, and the program was
opened by a short story composed and
read by C. M. McCaskill. The central
thought of his story was the devotion of
a wife to her husband. McCaskill was
followed by A. L. Wilson, who read a
story of college life as composed by an-
other student. The third number was a
new serial, the first chapter of whic!
was written by C. H. Long. This chap-
tet was read by J. M. Gaston. The set-
ting was an Alabama mining town. This
is the second serial to be written by the
“beetles” this year. Each number of
the program was criticized, the good and
bad points in each selection being
brought out. ,

Under the head of business, D. L. Ma-
hood read a report of the actions of the
first convention of the State College
Press Association. The invitation to
meet with the Book Lovers Club of the
town was accepted, so that the next
meeting will be held with the ladies in
the Civic League Hall. Sigma Upsilon
then stood adjourned, and retired to the
festivities.

Although just started this year the
Dramatic Club made a big hit among the
Davidson students and friends of the
college. Under the able supervision of
Prof. “E. J. Erwin, assisted by F. N.
Thompson, the president of the club, a
very creditable performance was staged
last fall. It was discovered that there
was some real talent among the stu-
dents for this kind of work. The play
was a success from every standpoint to
say the lexst. The club, feeling very
much encouragement over their initial
performance and the generous support
given them, decided to stage another
play in the spring.

The club promises this second treat
on the evening of March sth, when it
will present two short one-act plays:
The Lost Silk Hat, by Lord Dunsany;
and one of the famous plays of the
Harvard Dramatic Club, The Florist
Shop, by Winifred Hawkbridge. The
casts are as follows:

The Lost Silk Hat:

The Caller—F. N. Thompson.

The Laborer—J. H. McKeithen.

The Clerk—H. K. Russell.

The Poet—J. M. Gaston.

The Policeman—W. J. Cooper.

The Florist-Shop:

Maude—E, T. Woolfolk.

Slovsky—A. L. Wilson.

Miss Wells—D. S. Fogey.

Mr. Jackson—J. A. Beaver.

Henry—L. D. Elkins.

Some good musical numbers will be
given between the plays. The musical
program will be announced later.

CENTER OF FINANCIAL
INTEREST ON CAMPUS SHIFTS

Behold—the
has swung from Ponzi's establishment
to the emissaries of the firm of D. J.
Carpenter and Sons (U. S. Salvage Cor-
poration) now located at 5 Watts. The
Sergeant Major, future Commander of
the “Davidson Home Guard,” has just re-
turned from an extensive tour of the
U. S. Salvage shops; bringing back new,
and otherwise, samples of “yaller
breeches,” calvary puttees, goat-skin
raincoats, and many other scratch ‘'em
garments.

Weeks before their formal opening,

“commerical pendulum”

the MAJOR partner, ordered the ser-

placed on all billboards within the im-
mediate vicinity such significant posters
as “skinny” clothed with a barrel; show-
ing the immediate need of the establish-
ment’s line of goods.

High prices, certainly not! Bargains,
most absolutely! Only Efird could af-
ford to sell goods at fifty per cent of
half price, minus freight charges, over-
head expenses, interest, discount, and
war tax. This new establishment far
overshadows Efiird in his unique price
cutting. Military tax is the only profit
made, but in the end this is contributed
to the sinking fund of the MAJORITY

Marie Bonitz Chosen President—
Music Seniors Enjoy Trip to New
York.

‘(By N. C. Collegiate Press Service)

N. C. C. Wy Feb. 21—At the regular
mass meeting February 9, 1921, officers
of the Student Government Association
were elected for the year 1921-22, From
the list of capable candidates for the
presidency, Marie Bonitz was chosen
because of her competency, personality,
democracy and every other requisite for
this office. Marie Bonitz has made an
overwhelming success of everything she
has undertaken during her three years
in college. She takes part, with inter-
est, in every activity on the campus—
from athletics to Y. W. C. A.

Enthusiasm kept up during the entire
election. The other officers were voted
on with just as much care as was the
president. The president-elect is for-
tunate in having such a splendid staff of
co-workers as the following: : Vice-
president, Branson Price; secretary,
May Belle Penn; treasurer, Susic Rob-
erts; fire chief, Kate Mitchell; cheer
leader, Dorothy Clement; chief mar-
shall, Lila Ward Koonce.

The ten music seniors have returned
to college from an enjoyable trip to
New York, where they were chaperoned
by Professor and Mrs. Wade R. Brown.
While there they attended many famous
operas, several concerts and recitals.
The remainder of their time was en-
tirely taken up with sight-secing, both
in New York and Washington, ,where
they stopped on their way back to col-
lege.

PRELIMINARIES FOR INTER-

COLLEGIATE DEBATES

(Continued from page 1)
* Phi Society.

The Phi Society held its preliminary
for the inter-collegiate debating team
on last Friday night. The question for
discussion was, Resolved: That the
United States should cancel the loans
made to her Allies during the World
War. The debate was, as a whole, one
whcih showed thorough preparation.
The debaters seemed at case on
the floor and had plenty of fight
on the rebuttals, which were short
and to the point. Those on the
affirmative were: L. A. Taylor, J.
M. Dunlap, J. I. Knight and C. G. Long.
Those on the negative were: F. V. Long,
H. A. Hill, and J. F. Clark. The affirma-
tive argued that the debts should he
cancelled, showing that the European
countries were economically and finan-
cially unable to pay the indemnities. The
negative showed mainly that France and
England were able to pay their indem-
nities and that injustice would be shown
to the Amcrican peopic if the loans were
cancelled. Each debater was allowed
ten minutes, which he might use as he
desired. The judges who were Drs. Sen-
telle and Shewmake, and Rev. J. V. Hun-
ter chose C. G. Long, L. A. Taylor, J. M.
Dunlap, and J. L Knight as the four de-
baters who shall meet the Eu’s with J.
F. Clark as alternate.

LE CERCLE FRANCAIS.

Le Cercle Francais met last Thursday
night in the Kappa Alpha hall. One of
the most enjoyable programs of the
year was rendered. A. C. Summers and
R. R. Deavor gave some French an-
ecdotes then T. F. Martin and C. F.
Wildman in appropriate costumes gave
a dialogue between an American tour-
ist and a French sales girl. Professor
Hunt next gave some interesting similar-
ities between the pronunciation of
French words and other words, illustra-
ting them with cartoons. He also gave
illustrations of a game that the French
are very fond of. Dr. Lingle was the
last speaker on the program and he
described the location and condition of
the war devastated areas. Then after a
short business meeting the circle ad-
journed. The next meeting, to be held
the middle of March, will be at the
home of Professor Hunt.
