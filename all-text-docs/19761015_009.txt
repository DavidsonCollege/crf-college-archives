Ove Gavkdeoriies:

KA 1 kills ATC

By THE
BODACIOUS TA-TA’S
Displaying the rudeness

that has contributed to their
reputation as one of the worst
teams in flickerball, PDT #3
purposely scheduled their
game to conflict with the
scheduled debut of OK Cho-
rale with the Mormon Taber-
nacle Choir.

Obviously depressed, and
with their minds on Though
Your Sins Be of Scarlet, OK
Chorale put in a perfor-
mance, which made the sharp
PDT #3 team look all the
better. In the finis, PDT 43
triumphed, 12-6.

Dirty Old Men found no
pleasure in Doggie Style. Ex-
pecting to find the path to
victory, they failed to rise to
the occasion and found only
furrows dig by their weathered
noses and crooked canes.

Doggie Style found satisfac-

tion in a 40-6 victory.
ATO managed to show up

for their game last week but
their futile, disordered perfor-
mance was likened to that of a
constipated herd of cabbage
plant amoeba cows. The crazy
loons of KA #1 mercilessly
butchered ATO by the whop-
ping score of 101-0.

CATHY HOWARD of Little Women

The impotent ATO squad

even allowed the minute Steve.

Sellers to ‘‘stand up’’ in the
end zone to catch a pass. Next
time ATO has a “game,” we
suggest they field a men’s
team.

Nocturnal Emission came
out in the light of day and
stuck the Whizz Kids, 40-13.
Steve ‘‘Peazle head’’ Porter
led the knightly emitters to
victory with some spectacular
moves. Nobody hag ever seen
the likes of Porter’s finely
turned mustache.

Off Again generated an
anti-Delt offense and bull-
dozed the emaciated PDT #2
team to oblivion, 33-13. Mark
Scandling was particularly
outstanding as he continually
pinned the PDT #2 quarter-
back, Dick Butkiss, behind
the line.

Mill Town Queen Lynn
Langley stunned Nag's Nym-
pho’s with her dainty jaunts
across the goal line for Little
Women. The insatiable Nag’s
Nympho’s were repeatedly
frustrated in their attempts to
jam the Little Women scoring
mechanism, and eventually
succumbed, 18-6.

After the game it was
reported that Nag’s Nympho’s

Henderson House had a good
time at the expense of the

them 20-0.

We would like to commend
the IMAC referees on their
concise reporting of events on
the flickerball field. The re-
ports are so concise, in fact,

that they tell us nothing but .

We would ask that the
referees expand their horizons
and use whatever imagination
they might have to compose a
brief summary of each game.

Club Gridders down Catamounts
face Duke Blue Devils Sunday

By STAN BROWN
Staff Writer

Behind a high-geared run-
ning attack and an inspired
defense which continually for-
ced mistakes, the Davidson
Club Football team upset the
more experienced Catamounts
of Western Carolina, 20-3.

After getting the ball in
good field position early in the
first quarter, the Wildcats
broke on top with Bob Bishop
scoring on a short run. The
conversion failed, and David-
son led 6-0.

The Cats added to their lead
in the second quarter when
Brad Huggins scored from the
Western 18-yard line on a well-
executed option. The conver-
sion again failed and Davidson
led at the half, 12-0.

The stunting Davidson de-
fense continued to confuse the
