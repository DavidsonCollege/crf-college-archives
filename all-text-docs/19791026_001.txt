solar greenhouse

Members of the Davidson
Energy Group and other inter-
ested students are engaged this
week in building a solar green-
house in Huntersville. It is the
first solar energy based project

in the area.

The 16 by 10 foot greenhouse,
explained Junior Geoff Little,
one of the coordinators of the

project, is a ‘‘passive solar ‘

design,” circulating heat with-
out a motor. Steel drums,
painted black and filled with
water, absorb heat during the
day. Cool air, entering from
vents in the cellar, is heated by
the drums. As it rises, this
heated air passes into the house
through windows.

The Energy Group plans to
publish a newsletter on green-
house construction after the

Peeping tom suspect accused of
gazing into Cannon and Richardson.

By ELIZABETH KISS

Assistant News Editor
Robert A. Witte, 22, was
arrested near Richardson dorm
by campus police last Saturday,
at 2:10 am following a report of

a prowler outside of Cannon.
Patrolman J.M. Griffin, who
made the arrest, charged Witte
with trespassing, being a peep-
ing tom, and possession of

marijuana, a misdemeanor. The |

trial date has not been set.

Two years ago, Davidson
resident Witte was arrested for
chasing two female students on
the third floor of Little dorm

‘with a butcher knife. He was

forbidden by a court order to
return to college property.
Senior Anna Hutchinson
heard some rustling outside her
window in basement Cannon
around 1:30 am. “I looked out
and there was a guy standing,
looking in the window,’’ she
said. “I asked him who he was,

Faculty compensation increases in dollars but decreases against inflation

A Davidson professorship is
certainly not a goldmine, ac-
cording to statistics recently
released by the College and
Davidson’s chapter of the
American Association of Uni-
versity Professors.

Although the Trustees have
given the faculty a pay raise
each of the past five years,
inflation has more than offset
the increases almost every year,

William Styron, prominent author, to return to Davidson

By AIDA DOSS

‘The announcement sheet has
been touting his visit for several
weeks, the faces of English
professors light up at the men-
tion of his name, and his novels
are some of the hottest moving

books in the library.
He is William Styron, author
of the current bestseller Soph-
ie’s Choice and a former David-

son student, returning next -

Wednesday to meet with prof-
essors and students and to give

a reading from some of his-

works in Love Auditorium. He
is widely considered to be a
major force in current American
literature. Said Tony Abbott,
English professor: “I think mo-
st people would rank him am-
ong the top dozen or so contem-
porary American novelists.”
Styron’s’ latest novel is the
fifth in his writing career which

began with the publication: of

Lie Down in Darkness in 1961
and continued with The Long
March and Set This House on
Fire. Connie Welsh, wife of

to the Trustees last spring.
And faculty members are

concerned, both for the quality -

of education at Davidson, and
their for their own financial well
being.

Even the extra 7 percent

‘increase the Trustees allotted

for faculty and staff salaries
probably will. not result in an
increase in real faculty income,
since most economists are esti-
mating inflation for this year at
around 11 percent.

Music professor Wilmer Welsh,
recalls that she was ‘‘absolutely
delighted’’ with these earlier
novels. ‘‘I felt I had discovered
a major writer. His writing was
swift and beautiful.”

In 1967, The Confessions of
Nat Turner was met by mixed
critical acclaim and contro-
versy. It won the Pulitzer Prize

for fiction, but many blacks—-

were distressed that Styron had
so completely fictionalized an
actual and important event in
the history of the_ blacks’
struggle for emancipation. They
felt that certain major aspects
of the history of Turner’s rebel-
lion had been trivialized, and
they also doubted whether a

twentieth century white author .

could truly transmit the emot-
ions of a nineteenth century
black slave onto the printed
page.

History professor David Shi
admits that Styron “distorted
the facts to fit a contemporary
theme,” but adds that Conjfes-
sions was “‘a period piece which
reflected the ambiance of the

ical insurance, and other fringe
benefits) for a full professor is
now $33,685; Associate Profes-
sor $26,486; Assistant Profes-
sor $19,978; and Instructor
$16,007. The average total com-
pensation for all ranks is
$25,658.

In terms of 1966 dollars, the
average total compensation for
all ranks has dropped from
$13,301 in 1966-67 to $11,930 in
1978-79. Unless the economy

tries to deal with the large
issues and is unafraid to grapple
with the complex and frustra-
ting moral problems of this
era.’’ Shi believes that such
literature can be read as social
commentary, as a force to
promote change in a positive
way.

If William Styron does indeed
wish to increase awareness and
promote social understanding,
as well as tell an entertaining
story, he has picked a magnifi-
cent subject in Sophie’s Choice
—the Holocaust and the awful
‘attempt at Jewish extermina-
tion by the Nazis. I picked up a
copy of the el this summer
after reading several reviews by
major periodicals, almost all of
which were glowingly favorable

and which hailed Styron as a .

major and driving force in
American literature.
I had been led to expect a
good story with real, not con-
trived, motives behind it—and
I was not disappointed. With-

College President Samuel
Spencer explained the drop
saying ‘‘Inflation has outrun
our ability to keep up with it.”
He said Davidson’s problems
are part of a nationwide trend in
which ‘Most colleges and uni-
versities just haven’t had the
resources to keep salaries and
wages up with the cost of
living.”’

and he didn’t say anything.”
When Hutchinson moved to
awake her roommate, the
prowler darted away.

After going outside without
seeing anyone, Hutchinson and
senior Bunny Horine used the
emergency phone to report the
incident.

According to Police Chief R.
H. Mills, town dispatcher Paul
Martin received the Call-at 1:40
am and promptly notified Car
11 of Campus Security.

Griffin, after getting the call,
first investigated the area
around Cannon. Explained Ser-
geant Harold Cook of Campus
Police, ‘When we get a prowler
call, we usually look outside
before we go-to the rooms.”

Griffin and another officer
then went in to talk to Hutchin-
son and Horine around 2 am,
twenty minutes after the initial
call. Hutchinson described the
prowler. eas

“A few minutes later, as I
was checking around all of the
women’s dorms, I noticed
someone looking into a base-
ment window of Richardson,”
Griffin said. He watched the
man for a few minutes. ‘‘When
he heard my police radio click.
he took off and I grabbed him.”

Hutchinson and Horine said
they were glad Witte was
caught, but were afraid that he
could come back anytime. ‘It
bothers me that he is sstill
running around out there,”’ said
Hutchinson. “He could easily
have crawled_in a window.”

Witte is now out on bail.
