and many hours of confusion with
the Institution of International

bus for the “variety vacationland”

“seemed very rough to me” (some
would consider this an understate-

agreement, Erie will only be with
us one year, but he is making the
most (and a little more) of this
one year. He is taking Chemistry
21, Chemistry 31, Biology, and psy-
chology, making a total of four
labs a week, but “I don't seem to
be rushed.” In fact, he does a little
tutoring in German on the side.
Eric plans to be a surgeon, possibly
working in conjunction with the
