Professors

Ed:tor’s Note: The follow-
ing report was prepared by
Professors Charles Raftliff,
David Kaylor, and Robert Av-
inger for the local chapter of
the American Association of
University Professors, and
they have agreed to its pub-
lication.

To our knowledge there does
nct exist any systematic method
for assisting the college admin-
istration in the formation of
budget priorities. It is true that
wise choice depends ‘on good
judgment but good judgment
alone does not guarantee wise
choice. The committee there-
fore recommends that the ad-
ministration seriously consider
the adoption of a planning, pro-
gramming, budgeting system
(PPBS).

Program budgeting is a sys-
tem for ‘‘assisting choice relat-
ed to the use of resources.” It
the efore has the capability of
making clearer the alternatives
available and the costs associat-
ed with each of these alterna-
tives.

In short, it is choice illuminat-
ing in the sense that It provides
comparative informaton organ-
ized around identifiable pro-
grams or functions of the col-
lege.

The need for a PPBS system
arises because of two primary
co-ditions. First, resources are
scarce—that is, we cannot do
every hing that we would l’ke to
do such as produce a Rose Bowl
contender. have several Nobel
prizewinners on the faculty, and
have the highest faculty salaries
and the lowest student to facul-
ty ratio in the nation.

Second, in educational  sys-
tems there are no automatic
regulators —namely, prices, prof-
its. and losses—that can guide
resources into alternative func-
tions and that can tell use when
a function or program has either
outlived its usefulness or could
be made more efficient.

The s‘arting point is the pro-
gram budget. Optionally, the
output or final products of the
institution must be identified.
This implies that the goals of
the college should be  under-
stood and articulated.

The Revised By-Laws of the
Trustees of Davidson College
(October 22, 1971) Identify the
following goals or purposes of

~ The Scots Guards, a 330-year
old Scottish military company,
will sing Beatles’ songs, do the
Highland fling, and play bag-
pipe melodies in the Charlotte
Coliseum at 8 p.m. on Feb. 10.
Tickets to the drum, bagpipe,
band and dancer corps are $3
to $5.

“The Barter of Seville” star
ring Thomas “Palmer as Figaro
comes to Ovens Aud‘torium next
Monday evening at 8:15. Tickets
to this English rendition of Ros-
sini’s famous play range from
$1.50 to $5. A special free mat-
inee rehearsal for youth Sunday

afternoon at 2:30 is-open to all

students.

the college:

(1) a commitment to the
Christian religion, particularly
to the Presbyterian Church as
fostered by religious services
and activities;

(2) quality teaching and in-
struction centered around ‘a
smal! community of learners”
and “‘‘personal relationships be-
tween students amd teachers;"

(3) the promotion of ‘‘creative
scholarship” on the part of the
faculty:

(4) the selection and admis-
sion of quality students;

(5) the provision of physical
education;

(6) the encouragement of com-
petitive athletics:

(7) the provision of varied so-
cial and cultural activities.

As supportive ef the above
goals, the college’ should (8)
“provide adequate. physical fa-
cilities” and (9) ‘increase its
financial resources.”

Once the task of elucidating
goals has been accomplished,
the budget should be construed
with these goals or outputs as
major programs. Of course, sub-
categories or programs would
also be defined.

For example, a major pro-
gram would be teaching and in-
struction; however for more de-
tailed planning the latter would
consist of sub-programs or func-
tions like the Honors College,
the Department of Instruction-
al Development, the Humanities
Program, and academic depart-
ments.

The first step, specifications
of the programs and their ob-
jectives, having been accom-
plished, the second task is to
measure the output of each pro-
gram. Although this is the most
troublesome aspect of education-
al programs, certain proxies are
available. The third step in-
volves the measurement of the
total costs of each program. Fi-
nally, alternatives are analyzed
and decisions are made.

Hopefully, such a system will
make for better, more rational,
decisions and will lead to a bet-
ter allocation of resorces. In
short, ‘‘the program budget isa
potent instrument for communi-
cation and an intelligent super-
structure without which analy-
sis becomes furile.”

budget, several caveats should
be mentioned. First, program
budgeting is basically a planning

tool. tt is not intended as a
guide for making short-term re-
allocations of funds.

Second, it is not intended to
supplant administrative or po-
litical decision-making. It is not
a system of decis:ca by com-
pu:ers: thus it does not over-
look the human element by at-
tempting to quantify everything.
But it should enable us to move
away from extensiye use of “ad
hocery” in setting our budget
priorities and allocations.

Finally. it may be disruptive
in the sense that it can facil-
itate frank and open exc ange
between faculty and adminis-
tration and among faculty on
the ‘‘real” alternative costs of
various college functicnos and
programs. .

Now to some examples. Several
blatant shortcomizgs are appar-
ent from even a cursory review
of the College's budgeting sys-
tem (see Treasurer's Repo:t,
1970-71). We shall mertion only
a few.

ATHLETICS AND
PHYSICAL EDUCATION

A reasonable case can be
made for a classification into
two programs—physical educa-
tion (intramural and _ instruc-
tion) and intercollegiate athlet-
ics.

The latter program could pos-
sibly be further divided into two
sub-prog:ams, subsidized and
non- subsidized _ in‘ercollegiate
athletics, with further  refine-
ment into the various sports.
The prese“t budget, however, is
divided into three major cate-
gories:

(a) Organized Activities Relat-
«d to Educational Departments:
Athletics and Physical Euca-
tion, which involved total ex-
penditures of $379.000 of wh:ch
$245.000 were salaries.

(b) Grants-in-Aid involving
$143,000 for football and $53,000
for basketball.

(c) Intercollegiate Athletics,
which listed income from games
and the expcnces associated with
each sport. The net profit of
our intercollegiate program(s)
as reported in this budget item
was $20 000.

All salaries, whether of full-
time intetcollegiate coaches or
of physical education instruc-
tors, were allocated under cate-
gory (a). Thus the costs of the
various intercollegiate sports
(category (c)) did not accu-
rately reprezent the real costs
of these programs. The same
criticism can be levied at ‘‘sup-
plies and equipment” costs in-

cluded in category (a) and
Grants-in-Aid.
INSTRUCTION

(a) LABORATORIES AND
DEPARTMENTS. In_ 1970-71,

= — - CO

$69,000 was allocated in this cat-
egory. Presumably this groups
together science, language, and
accounting labs. It is unclear
that these ccustitute a single
program.

(b) HONORS COLLEGE. The
total amount budgeted was $34,-
000, yet a portion of the sal-
aries of those faculty members
in the Honors College should be
so allocated. At the same time,
the Dean of the Honors College
also teaches in the regular cur-
riculum. The first omiss'on un-
ders ates the cot of this pro-
gram: the second overstates It.
On balance, there is no way,
given our prescnt budgeting sys-
tem, to determine the cost of
this program.

(c) R:O.T.C. AND AUDIO-VIS-
UAL. This is a clas3:c case of
t:ying to mix ol and water.

(d) FACULTY: OTHER EX-
PENSES. This item ($88.000)
proba: ly includes the cost of the
typing pool: but these serv ces
aie also utilized by admin stra-
tive pe sonnel. A proper alloca-
tion would distritute these ex-
perses to the appropriate pro-
grams.

OTHER GENERAL
INSTITUTIONAL EXPENSES
(a) INVESTMENT AND CUS.

TODIAL SERVICES. If a major
goal of the College is to ‘‘in-
crease its financial resources”
(see By-Laws, Board of Trus-
tees), then this goal should be
idctified with the ‘‘Develop-

ment” program, and these funds
($26,000) shculd Le so allocated.

(b) CENTRAL PUNCH CARD.
To the extent that the computer
is jointly u:ilized by the faculty
(for instruction and for re-
search), the registrar, the busi-
ness office, etc., these expenses
($40,000) should be allocated ac-
cordingly. Again, only by such
an allocation czn the real costs
of specific programs be a3sess-
ed.

(c) STAFF RECRUITMENT,
ANNUALS AND HANDBOOKS.
Once again this category does
not iden ify any specific pro-
gram. Second, if the expenses
($2 000) were incurred to rec: uit
staff. then they should be allo-
catcd to the particular staff pro-
gram or funct’on affected. If
faculty rec: u'tment necessi'atcd
these expe ditures, then a dif-
ferent allocation would be ap-
propriate.

(d) REPLACEMENT OF DIC.
TAPHONES OND OTHER OF-
FICE EQUIPMENT. The logic
of example (c) above also ap-
plies to these expenses ($9,000).

he above illustrations wll
hopefully substantiate the need
for a change in our budge‘ ing
process. At present it is diffi-
cult, if not impossible, to ascer-
tain what programs the College
has, how they ate related to
the goals of the College, and
what their to.al costs are.

And it is only through a knowl.
edge of these issues that pro-
grams can be evaluated, re-
sources can be utilized most ef-
fect:vcly in furthering the goals
of the College and, in short,
wise decisions can be made.
