Trustees support staged divestment from Squth Africa

By MARK CHEN

Last Friday, the Davidson
College Board of Trustees voted
on and announced a revised di-
vestment policy. Concerning
South Africa, the trustees an-
nounced their support for staged
divestment from companies in
South Africa, rather than total and
immediate divestment.

According to’ Ralph Holt,
chairman of the Finance Commit-
tee, the policy would be one of
selective divestment after “due
process.” Companies failing to

comply with the standards of the .

college would be urged to by the
Finance Committee. Sharehol-
der’s resolutions might also be
used. If a year passed without im-
provement, the college would sell
its shares.

Ben Craig, Chairman’ of the

Board of Trustees, announced that
the policy would rely on the Sulli-
van principles to judge corporate
performance. These principles
were created in 1977 by Rev.
Leon Sullivan. The principles rate
companies in- South Africa ac-
cording to their efforts to end
apartheid. These efforts involve
equal employment for all races,
moving members of discriminated
races in South Africa into super-
visory and management jobs, and
improving the quality. of employ-
ees’ lives outside the work envi-
ronment..

Sullivan himself plans to
abandon the Sullivan principles
by May 31,1987. He has called

them ineffective in fighting apar-*

theid: When asked about Sulli-
‘van’s opinion, Holt replied that
the principles still stood, with or
without Sullivan’s name. The
school would still use them in the
divestment policy.

Craig felt that total divestment

would not be as effective as the

new policy. “I submit you get the
attention of a corporation when
you correspond with them. They
might not even know it when you
divest,” he said.

Larry Dagenhart, counsel to
the college and secretary for the
trustees, believed that a policy of
total. divestment might get out of
hand. Other groups might call for
divestments based on social: con-

cerns: ‘‘How:about companies that:
deal in alcohol?:How about:com-

_panies: that: deal in tobacco?’”. he

said.
Some students disagreed with

the policy and met with the trus- |

tees. Michael Makonnen ’88 be-
lieved that Davidson’s invest-
ments were not large enough to

give it much say. “Davidson is a
small institution. If you have a
large share of equity, you can
make a difference. But Davidson

ments to. have important lever-

ported the policy. “Through the
companies’ presence in South Af-
rica, you institutionalize change,”
he said. Further, he argued that
turmoil might follow from the col-
lapse of the South African govern-

ment. “All you’ ve done is replace
a black elite witha white elite,” he
said. :
Rob Ellison ’87, president of
the Black Student Coalition and a
member of the committee, disag-
reed with the policy. He believes
that the Sullivan principles are in-
adequate. While contact between
trustees and the other members of
the committee was good, he felt
that the committee should have
been more diverse. He wished that
there had been more members of
the Presbyterian Church, U.S.A.
The church has come out with a
policy that is more stringent than
the one endorsed by the trustees. _
The implementation process

. has not been decided. Presently

the policy is a matter for the Fi-
nance Committee. The advisory
committee has been disbanded. At
the press conference, Craig said
that the results of correspondence
between the college and com-
panies in South Africa might be
released. However, there are no
plans for a regular report on prog-
ress for the Davidson community.
The trustees would give it infor-
mally to students and others of the
college community who wished to
communicate with the trustees.
Rick Love emphasized that
the policy was broad enough to in-
clude. any moral concerns of the
community. He also said that the
primary responsibility of the trus-
tees was the college. “People have
not contributed to the endowment
to make it socially active. The
trustees’ primary legal reponsibil-
ity ‘is to’keep the college stable.”
Ellison hoped that there would

be more work done with the in-
vestment policy. “I would like to
think that the school hasn’t closed
the. book:on this issue altogether,
he said.”

WDAV eliminates Filipsides from programming

By JULIAN MYLCHREEST

On May 5 it was decided to
take “Flipsides”, WDAV’s late
evening alternative rock program,
off the air. To quote John Clark,
the station’s manager since March
’81, “The long term plans are to
make WDAV the best classical
music and arts radio station in the
southeast. ‘Flipsides’ is not com-
patible with those challenging
plans. As a format, it just does not
fit.”

WDAYV first came on air in the
late ’60s as a small ten-watt, stu-
dent-operated station, broadcast-
ing a mix of classical, jazz and
rock. However, in 1977, at the in-

Studerts express opinions on all sus in

stigation of the trustees, its power
was increased and its program-
ming took on a clear classical em-
phasis. There were disputes and
resignations as the professionals
moved in; for six weeks the station
was off the air completely. In an
attempt to reach a consensus
“Flipsides” was born — a daily
slot for new, alternative music,
run and presented by students.
Since *77 it has been a regular fea-
ture of WDAV’s programming,
carving out a niche for itself with
its radical rock format. Tom Vin-
ton, one of the student announ-
cers, says, “We are unique. No

But it is not just the fear of al-

airwaves that bothers the student

being left out of WDAV and see-

ing the station, which receives

$60,000 a year from the college
coffers, becoming an exclusively
professional outfit. “It will be-

and the administration, with no

strongly contends. “It is a great
mistake to equate ‘Flipsides’ with
student involvement. The deci-
sion to cancel ‘Flipsides’ will not
affect efforts to recruit qualified
students.” » :

Despite ‘such reassurances,
student doubts and bitterness re-
main. They are angry at the late-
ness of the decision, and suspi-
cious of the real motives for it.

Clark emphasises that the ‘Flip-

sides’ decision “is not a reflection
on the inherent merits of the alter-
native rock programming,” yet
some of the ‘Flipsides’ team re-
main suspicious. Even if it isn’t
true, insists Eichelberger, “The

impression that they don’t care re-
mains.”

Plans are now afoot to set up a
new. ten-watt station run by the
students for the students. Clark
has agreed to hand over the exten-
sive ‘Flipsides’ record library and
lend some assistance in getting
things started. What is needed
now are funds and, most impor-
tantly of all, says Vinton, student
and faculty support. “We want
people to be out there for love,
joining in and doing their own
