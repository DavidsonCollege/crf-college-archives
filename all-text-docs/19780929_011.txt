Cave catiem, ad astra per
aspera! Welcome and ail that

crap. There has been some big’

news this past week on the
Flickerball scene.

As thost of you know there
has béen'a terrible shortage of
IMAC.zefs for the last two
weekgs..The problem got so bad
at one time that IMAC czar
John Ratliff threatened to ter-
minate the season if something
was not done immediately.

What did you say? Fall at
Davidson without flickerball?
Well, that is almost: like horse-
turds without horseflies, or
ARA without train wreck.

But just when Ratliff was
about to issue the executive
order to end the season, Presi-
dent Spencer and. Registrar
Richard ‘‘Dick’’ Burts came to
the rescue, each with their own
separate plan to solve the
problem.

Burts noted. that, ‘‘I think
my plan is the best because it is
so much less complicated. Ev-
ery student will pre-register for
the flickerball season (including
the initialed approval of advi-
sor, major advisor, team cap-
tain, and two townies) and then
once again three days before
each game.

‘*This will allow the front
office to predict which games
will be forfeits and not need
refs. Therefore, by allocating
those flickerball officials we
have now more efficiently we
won’t need to hire any new

‘officials. It will ve believe
me. After all, we have always
had enough courses available to
students at drop/add under my

plans, haven’t-we?”

use of hand was assessed.

“I think we can kill two birds
with one stone. We can solve
the problems of poor student-

faculty relations and lack of refs:

by merely allowing some profes-
sors to officiate a few of the
contests. During the half we

Soccer drops two

due to inexperience

By ROB GILLISON

Soccer coach Karl Krémser
feels that his team’s record
should be: 4-1. The fact is,
however, that after two losses
this week—at the feet of Win-
throp (2-0) and Western Caro-
lina (4-1)—the team’s record is
a not-so-bright one win, three
losses, and a tie.

Kremser’s only explanation is
the plea of coaches everywhere;
experience, or the lack thereof.
In the case of Davidson soccer
there are two points of evidence
to back Kremser’s feeling.

First is the relatively new
status of soccer at Davidson.
The second is that at any point
in a game there may be as many
as eight freshmen on the field.

Kremser characterizes the
last two games as ‘‘disorgan-
ized’’, a style of play that, as
coach, he is trying to discour-
age. He is trying to institute a
philosophy of control and pa-
tience. ‘‘But soccer,’’ Kremzer
maintains, “hasn't been at Da-
vidson Jong enough to establish
a traditional style of play.”

Asa result the team is easily
caught up in a “kick-the-ball-
as-far-as-you-can and hope-
you- * attitude, the
cause of the last two losses.

But Kremser is confident that
soccer will be successful here in
the long run. It’s the immediate
future that’s unpredictable. Ad-
versity generally has two pre-
dictable effects. It can bring out
‘the best in an athlete, make him
“*shine’’, when under other cir-
cumstances he might yo unno-

ticed.

Kremser sees this in indivi-
dual cases and these are the

people he will play: The other:

effect, one more common on a
young and inexperienccd team,
is to demoralize. For the future
of soccer at Davidson lvt’s hope

it’s the former.

time; and would be interested in
helping out. And as all of you
know I am still pushing for
self-selection of flickerball
teams. Williams has had a lot of
success with that in the past.”

Ratliff decided to go with
Spencer’s idea after President
Spencer showed young John
some tables illustrating the
problem of increasing unem-
ployment among small college
Economics professors. We
think John made a wise deci-
sion, and we would like to point
out that the first game under
these new rules will be played
Friday at 10 am with Dr. Jean
Cornell and Dr. George Aber-
nethy serving as officials.

The two teams, chosen at
random from a lottery, are the
SAE #1 team and the KA Gold
team. Good luck, men, you'll
need it.

In, keeping with past tradi-

tions we would like to once —

cut right, and then right there

the ball up and took it on in for

the score.

It was a great day for
MacFleet, but a bad one for
Mrs. Shi—the child looks just
like ‘‘Disco’”’ Dave, afro hair-
style and all.

Other big news this week is
that the Old Men:picked up free
