“CAUTION,” the triangular pink and yellow sign

said. “RADIATION AREA.”

The key turned in the lock.
I followed Dr. John Hopkins

of the Physics Department into
what he -called the “active
radioisotope storage room" in
the basement of the Dana
Seience Laboratories. I glanced
down at the yellow box in his
hand (survey meter, he called
it) and sdw the needle swing
over: Instinctively I stepped
back. .

Grinning, Dr. Hopkins mo-
tioned me to come ahead.
Then he unlatched the probe
from the meter and held it
before him. The needle
swung farther yet.

I noticed that we were stand.
ing before a small cubicle of
concrete blocks, and that what-
ever was making the -meter
register was coming from that
little box of concrete.

“We've got about half a
milliliter of Bismuth-210 in the
middle of that cube,” he said.
“You can see from the meter
that the. concrete doesn't pro-
vide adequate shielding. It's
only temporary, though. I’ve
got a shipment. of lead bricks
in the other room that I haven't
unpacked yet, and we'll move
those in here before long.”

He turned to leave. By this
time | was almost halfway to
the door.

“Funny thing,” he _ said.
“What most people don’t. realize
is that they are exposed every

dollars. but they had to cut the

“One thing, though: they re.

ceived applications for over six
million dollars’ worth of grants,
and all they had available was
fifty thousand. I think we did
pretty well to get five thousand
of . it.”

He leaned back proudly in

his chair to observe the effect

of this bombshell.

“Five thousand dollars,” I
echoed. “That's an awful lot of
money.”

“Not when you're buying
laboratory equipment,” he coun-
tered. “One piece of equipment
we: bought cost twenty-three
hundred dollars.”

“I'd like to get back into re-
search," he went on. “I did a
lot of it at Vanderbilt before’ I

He turned out the light and
closed the door, checking to be
sure it was locked.

“Take that sample in there.
it's ae highly radioactive
source, but it’s such a small
amount that you could sit on
that box for an hour without
any harm. The radiation you
would receive is equivalent
to what you would normally
get in a week just walking
around.”

I nodded dubiously.

Pulling out the clipping from,
an old Davidsonian which said
that Davidson had received a!
grant of five thousand dollars;
from the Atomic Energy Com- i
mission, I asked him about it.

German Professors
Tender Resignations

Last week Dean of the Faculty Frontis W. Johnston

was ntoified of

ossible additional vacancies in the

Davidson College faculty for next year. These bring to a
possible fourteen the total number of teaching positions

to be filled by September in order to maintain the faculty:

at its present strength for the fall term.

Dr. Joseph E. Alexis and Dr.
Howard P. French have made
known «their intentions to re-
sign. On March 4 Dr. Walter L.
Robinson tendered his resigna-
tion to be effective August 1,

After heaving oeen at David-
son for two years, Dr. Joseph
E. Alexis, visiting Professor
of Modern Languages, thinks
it time to resume the plan he
has pursued since retiring

braska six years ago—that of
teaching for a brief period at
different colleges and uni-
versities throughout the coun-
try.

Dr. Howard P. French, Asso-
ciate Professor of German, is
now considering several offers
that will take him out of the
classroom into research. His

Also commenting on the large
number of resignations and

that this is a higher number
