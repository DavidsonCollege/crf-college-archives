Cause For $10 increase

The editor of and at present,
the sole contributor to this:
monthly review, Nzongola is dis-
tributing copies to Congolese:
students in universities through:
out the United States. Its pri-
mary purpose is to help these
students better understand their:
responsibility to the Congo and
its inhabitants.

The first issue of this review,
which has just come off the
press, contains editorials, anal.
yses of events in the Congo and.
literary contributions, all writ-
ten in French.

Nzongola said he feels that
American newspapers give a
poor representation of what real-
ly happens in the Congo. Thus,
by reading British, French and
Congolese newspapers, Nzon-
gola can give a clearer picture
of these events through his edi-
torials and news analyses.
