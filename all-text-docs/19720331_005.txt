The Adventures Of Mott The Wopple: Cave Canum

Left to darkness and to me,
the campus was particularly
soothing the postnight that we
were discussing law 'n’ order in
Davoidson. Katamite Kayrat and
the Cockasnook were discussing
the approaching and very wel-
come invasion from the land of
Distaffia, and, since I was fill-
ing out my Campus Security
Questionnaire at the time, the
problem of protecting our in-
vadresses came up.

There had been a lot of talk
about increasing the number of
Davoidson Rough Riders (as
they are fondly known) in view
of slimy perverts who infest the
grounds, waiting to pounce: up-~
on the girls who play frisbee
games postnightly on the quad
(according to a recent poll taken
by the clinical psychologist,
these repulsive misfits number
close to a thousand). Unfortu.
nately, Senator Rowland's having
defeated a proposal to supply
the girls with morning stars had
brought about a solution I found
personally distasteful — flood-
lighting the campus.

“The minions of evil shall hide
their faces from the sun,” he
shouted.

Katamite Kayrat and the
Cockasnook said they were un-
willing to sacrifice either the
aesthetic qualities of the half-lit
grounds or the convenience of
having a natural cover for their
misadventures just for a little
law 'n’ order.

“Why not buy more grass
clippers?” ventured Flakely the

Davidson - Where Scholarship Is Prized!.

Cat, whose ears have never been
the same since he decided to

‘break into the church organ

while Dr. Welsh was playing
(Flakely the Cat has always
been the most accomplished and
thronic burglar among us). AS
usual, we ignored him.

Just as I came to the section
on my questionnaire about en-
counters with dangerous char-
acters in the area, the security
pickup parked across from Cas-
tle Pinky. The security pickup
is a futuristic vehicle equipped

- with all the most modern and

some as yet uninvented law en-
forcement devices: headlights, a
horn, wire wheels...

We watched the security offi-
cer go from building to building
across the way; it was Sec. Off.
Socolubi, Guardian of the Post-
night! Sec. Off. Socolubi spends

LETTERS

the entire postnight prowling the
campus, seeking out evildoers,
protecting our welfare with his
very person. And a lonely per-
son it must be. With riobody but
the Davoidson police to wave at
in passing, Sec. Off. Socolubi
drives around and around the
‘ollege, hour after hour immers-
ed in his own thoughts.

What does he think about? I
wondered. Does his mind over-
flow with noble thoughts of self-
sacrifice for the future leaders
of America? Does he, like his
colleagues on Adam-12, mull
over the meaning of Justice, as
set forth by the world’s most
renowned philosophers? Per-
haps, like the famous Rollaids
Cop on television, he hones his
steely nerves to be ready for the
attackers that may lurk around
any corner.

At any rate, I noticed that.
thanks to the efforts of Sec. Off.
Socolubi, I had nothing to write
in the part of the questionnaire
dealing with muggings and the
like. Naturally, then, I was
pleased to see him enter Castle
Pinky to check on our safety. I
Jonged to show my gratitude and
perhaps delve into the inscrut-
able workings of his razor-sharp
mind.

As he entered the room, I rose
to greet him but saw his eyes
widen with fury. He had seen
Garm, the toy terrier we keep
in the castle to fend off the
cockroaches. As is his wont when
confronted by a uniform, Garm
was seized by a fit of sneezing.
Sec. Off. Socolubi shrieked with
fear and rage.

“You... vou boys is trainin’

them hounds to attack us secur-
ity officers!”

“But...”

‘Us security officers can't
have none of this! I'm _ takin'
everybody’s name!”

“But...”

“You boys tried to get a dog
sn me once before and I got
him good!”

, But...”

“You boys think vou can get
me but [ll get you first! I'll
turn you all in!’ he screamed
as he stomped out.

T began to do the question
naire.

“Curb your anger as you
would curb your dog!” Senator
Rowland yelled after him.

‘Why not just buy more grass
clippers?”

Peace Won't Stop Communist Villians

To the Editor:

I read with great interest two
recent letters, written by room-
mates, about ROTC.

To Erwin C. Barron I espe
cially address this letter.

Imagine the entire world to
be just the town of Davidson,
and that there are two broad
ideological divisions among the
citizens.

One side believes in a master-

and-slave society. It would build
a wall around Davidson. No ore
would be free to enter or leave
at will. The outside world-would
be sealed off, as West Germany
is shut out by the Berlin wall
from Communist East Germany.

Freedum of speech, assembly
and the press—gone. Each per-
son would be told what he could
study, or what to work at. Chil-
dren would be taken from their
parents in infancy and taught
to worship the state and to de-
spise God. The ‘master and
slave” faction would be heavily
armed, and savagely ruthless in
the use of murder and terror to
gain political control. -

Opposed to this bloody enemy
is the “PEACE NOW” faction
of which Erwin Barron is a
member and. advocate. He has
allied with him a considerable
number of students, possibly
some older men, many of whom
are Christian, idealistic, and
amazingly uninformed about the
past record of success of the
‘‘master-and-slave” conspiracy.

Erwin’s faction would ‘give
up war” with those gangsters,
murderers, atheistic brutes who
have a plan to either dominate
or destroy Barron and every-
body else in the town of David-
son. Barron would develop ‘‘hu-
mane and Christian instincts”
which would cause him to walk
abroad with bared breast, hold-
ing aloft a ‘‘peace symbol”, be-
lieving this would shame the
aggressors into following his
idealistic example.

Erwin does not understand
that an atheist cannot follow a
Christian example. To an athe-
ist a human being is a soulless
animal. To a communist atheist
this Christian animal is to be
mastered or destroyed. Erwin
would lose either his liberty or
his life.

There you have, in miniature,
what is going on in the world
today.

David used a weapon, a sling
und a rock, to defeat the giant
Goliath. David very likely be-
longed to RTTC—Rock Throw-
‘ers Training Corp. Lucky for
David and his country that he
had taken this military train-
ing.

Bare hands will not prevail

against knives and guns. When
their intended victims are un-
armed, criminals are elated, but
not deterred.

I hope and pray that Erwin
C. Barron, and perhaps many
of his fine and idealistic friends,
will get practical enough to read
in the ‘‘Encylopedia Britannica”
everything that has been record.

tinds one act of Communist
mercy, write about it to the Da.

of Ceasar, Attilla, Napoleon,

standing of the views of room-
mate Jerry Huller.

Amherst Suspects Financial Aid Swindle

An an investigation conducted by Dean Routh at Am-
herst College, it was discovered that 34 per cent of Am-
herst’s financial aid recipients showed significant income
discrepancies between their parents’ IRS tax forms and
their parents’ confidential statements for financial aid.
Routh estimated that each of the students involved may
have received up to $700 more than he deserved.

Routh indicated that more extensive investigations will
be undertaken. He said that any inconsistencies which are
uncovered will not only be corrected in future grants, but
in retroactive adjustment as well. For example, if a stu-
dent has been receiving $100 in excess of his needs for two
years, his allocation for 1972-73 will be cut by $100. The
student also will be expected to pay back the $200 he re-
ceived unjustifiably from the college.

Amherst is not alone in the financial aid overpayment
swindle. Tufts, Harvard, M.I.T. and the University of Penn-
sylvania have all conducted studies and found a large per-
centage of income discrepancies between the tax forms
and the parents’ confidential statements. In an M.I.T. in-
vestigation, one parent sent in a check for $700 when asked
to submit his tax forms. The parent explained that he owed
the school about that much in scholarship assistance.

Judge Upholds Live-In-Dormitories Rule

A federal district judge has upheld a Northern Michi-
gan University rule that requires all students under 23
years of age to live in college-owned dormitories. A suit
was brought by students who charged that the dorm. rule
violated their freedom of choice and movement. The judge
ruled that there is no constitutional question involved in the
requirement, even for those students over 21.

Wake Forest Plans Grocery Discount

The Board for Economic Cooperation at Wake Forest
University has begun a program enabling students to buy
groceries. toiletries and other articles at wholesale prices.

For $1.75, any student can purchase membership in
this non-profit program called the Wake Forest Consumer
League. Various wholesalers will fill members’ orders twice
a week and will deliver the groceries to the Consumer
League’s campus headquarters.
