Dr. Cunningham Is Victor)

As Dog, Decorum Clash

An unspoken but deep-running pride of the Davidson stu-
dent body stems from the fact that they have never seen their
president without the fullest of composure on all occasions.

As speaker, arbiter, minister. group discussion leader, Dr.
Cunningham has always been the epitome of all the fine quali-
ties required of one in that particular role. Never has he fumbled
for words or action in any situation.

Tuesday, however, his decorum was challenged. A mid-
summer round-up of stray pups was intended to thwart any
such possible occurence this fall, but apparently it made no im-
pression on faculty pets. A big, black and white fireside fixture
who might have once been kin to a collie, ambled on stage to
join Dr. Cunningham. Charlottte Observer editor and publisher
Ralph Nicholson, and Observer associate editor Ruppert Gillette.

The latter two gentlemen being from Charlotte where
“cats’’ abound, it would never do to have a dog promenading on
the platform. Dr. Cunningham. while his student body watched
wonderingly, rose to the occasion and evicted the visitor.

-IJndeed, it was a ‘‘peculiar’’ pleasure.

Tradition has it that freshmen pledging fraternities at Davidson will do eo by coming up thé

walk

of the fraternity of their choice on the day of pledging. The Pi Kapps pledged and pinned one
all in one day. and they went to Charlotte to do it. The ex-pledge, now Rose of Pi Kappa Phi, is
glamorous TV star Faye Emerson, shown above receiving her pin from Pi Kapp president Sib Dor-
ton. Looking on longingly is Mitch Patton, who made the trip to see that all was properly attended.

218 Frosh Plus TV’s Faye
Taken In By Fraternities

Though 218 freshmen walked up 11 fraternity walks last Saturday in one of the Pan.
Hel’s biggest pledgings, the Pi Kappa Phi's got the prize pledge of all. President Sib Dorton
pinned glamorous Faye Emerson, First Lady of TV and Southern States’ Fair sponsor, and she

was named “Rose of Pi Kappa Phi’ for the Epsilon Chapter.

tain, begins practice for the season

this week. A number of lettermen

are expected back from last year's
very strong team which finished
27th in the nation.

Although the schedule has not
been completed, it is expected that
the team will fire nine shoulder-
to-shoulder matches and _ several
postal matches, plus the National
Intercollegiate matches in the
spring.

Hidden Projector

Emphasizing the Army teaching
system which includes a_ large
usage of visual training aids,
PMS&T Lt. Col. J. 1... Ballard
Jr., has indicated that a new
method of presenting fitms and
slides has been set up in the
ROTC building.

The idea is that the movie
projector is placed in a room im-
mediately beyond the classroom.
The film is there projected against
a mirror and the image reflected
against a frosted plate glass which
has been substituted for a portion
of the blackboard.

Two advantages result: (1) the
noise of the projector is eliminated,
and, (2) a much clearer, sharper
image appears on the frosted glass,
so much in fact that it can actually
be easily seen without darkening

Officials Visit

The Military Department was
visited Friday morning by the new
Chief of the N. C. Military District,
Col. Walter C, Buie, in company
with Lt. Col. Anderson, who is
the officer on Third Army's staff
for ROTC matters.

Both officers were making an
informal tour of the ROTC units
in the state.

The pinning ot Miss Emer-
son will be featered in the na-
tional magazine of the frater-
nity, Stars and Lamp, next
month. Miss Emerson was also
presented the traditional dozen
of American Beauty roses.

NUMBER TWO

Will Pay Off
t
, ay
The Court ‘of Control held its
first session last. Wednesday night
at 8:30. at which time several
freshmen were charged and tried.
Judge Johnny Guiton ‘said that
;the penalties rendered were ex-
ceedingly light, due to the fact
shat it was the first meeting of the
‘court and the i¢rdrance ot. cules
was taken as a partial éxcuse. for

Jsome infractions. But Guiton was

quickto add, with a tone of warn-
Ling, that. “It ll be a different story
‘from now on.”

The attitude of a few of the
offenders was very good, but
there is room for improvement
in most, according to the court
members, who held a_ short
meeting after the court ses-
sion was closed. They are all
in complete agreement that the
| penalties must become heavier
| if the effect. is to be the one
| sought for.

Ever since the taception -of its
program last Tall, the court
has steadily improved and will
continue their far more effective
schente. The court. members, *how-
ever, desire a greater cooperation
front the upperclassmen, particu-
larly during the chapel proceedings
kand in turning in offenses. The

Weekend Ministers

Big Year Seen
For Deputations

It looks like the biggest year ever ahead for Davidson's

Y deputation teams.

Every weekend volunteers in teams from the student body
at large go out to lead various meetings at churches and schools
in this area. The teams are prepared to conduct morning or

evening services, prayer meetings, |~

Sunday Schools and similar serv;
ices. Often they carry men for spe-
cial music presentations. |

This year there are more
calls for deputations than there
are boys to staff them, accord-
ing to George Knight who
heads this department of the
Yy.

All men interested in serving
on deputations this year re-

gardless of ability are strongly

urged to see Knight in 32
Georgia.
Sometimes the groups gu as

far as 60-75 miles from the cam-
pus.

hand of Service to the community
off campus and keep the Y at Da-

vidson from being centered on tot
narrow a sphere,” explained Knight.
