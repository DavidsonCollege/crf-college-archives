THE DAVIDSONIAN PRE V LIEW MONDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 1993

With the preseason just underway,
The Davidsonian’s Rick Thurmond
sat down with Coach Bob McKillop
to discuss this year’s seniors, the
Southern Conference, and some
team strengths and weaknesses as
he sees them heading into prac-
tice,

Davidsonian: Comment on the
three seniors Ron Horton, Jason
Zimmerman, and Janko Narat.

Coach McKillop: Ronald, Jason,
and Janko have seen the program
go from a situation of being an
independent coming off four wins
toa Souther Conference team that
has reached the middle of the pack.
We won fourteen games last year
and were 25-30 seconds away from
getting into the finals of the South-
ern Conference tournament and
perhaps a trip to the NCAA Tour-
nament. Their career here has been.
characterized by significant steps

evolved because of a genuine sense
of care and commitment that [the
players] have shown to each other.
A third strength would bea feeling
about Davidson, now this may
sound corny but, our guys are here
because they chose Davidson, not
because they chose a scholarship,
not because they chose what they
considered to be a basketball op-
portunity. They want to be at
Davidson College, they’re proud
to be at Davidson, and they’re
happy to be at Davidson College.
Sure they don’t wear rose-colored
glasses and think that everything
here is perfect, but they always
look at the positive side of what is
occurring here and they try to rep-
resent that in what they do in the
classroom, throughout the com-
munity, andon the basketball court.
From a technical standpoint, there
is no doubt that our strength is our

ner. Janko is a quiet leader who
leads by example. We are very
fortunate to have three guys like
that who can play leadership roles
and haveasense of chemistry about
themselves that is then transferred
down to the team.

D: What do you see as the team
strengths?

M: No question about it, number
one has to be our versatility. Num-
ber two has to be our sense of team
chemistry. Everyone on this team
understands that when the team
wins they will become astar. There
is not a star system on the team,
[the players] do not anticipate a
star system, and they do not seek a
star system. That chemistry has

deep and some-
times three deep [at each position].
So scoring ability and depth would
certainly be the key factors from a
technical and physical standpoint.
D: You mentioned the team’s ex-
cellent shooters. Will the three-
point shot be a weapon this year?
M: I’d love to say that it will be.
But I think that we can’t make that
assessment at this point just be-
cause we have great three-point
shooters. You need to be able to
stop the opponent and you need to
be able to rebound to create oppor-
tunities to shoot the three-pointer.
We’re hopeful, though, that with
our work and our maturity as a
team we will get plenty of opportu-
nities and more opportunities than
last year to shoot the three-point

shot.
D: How about some team weak-
nesses?

M: Well, the

going to look to get points for us?

schools pointed more in the direc-
tion of Davidson’s academic stan-
dards or maybe add a conference
team or two or three that would fit
into the academic framework that
we at Davidson have such a high
regard for.

D: AttheannualSouthernConfer- -
ence media day last week,
Davidson was picked to finish fifth
in the Conference. How do you
feel about that?

M: Well, we were picked tied for
fifth with Furman, so depending
upon which side of the coin you
look at, we could be sixth or fourth.
This is an improvement from last
year and maybe we can look at it
from this standpoint. Last year we
were picked ninth and we moved
up and finished fifth. So we fin-
ished four spots ahead of where we
were picked. We were picked fifth
this year and if we move up four
spots does that mean we’ll finish
first?

1, Davidson With three returning
scorers and depth out the wazoo,
the Wildcats are set to make their
second season in the Southern
Conference a memorable one. The
hole underneath will surely be filled
by aversatile group ofsophomores
and the best front-line in the con-
ference.

2. Eastern Tennessee State A
perennial conference powerhouse,
the Buccaneers failed to win 20
games for the first time in. four
years last season. That, however,
will notbe the case this time around.
With junior transfer Robert Dogget,
formerly a:player at Wake Forest,
the point guard position will be
solidified.

3. Marshall The Thundering Herd
are loaded this year despite the loss
of leading scorer Tyrone Phillips.

The Season Ahead
Our Conference Rankings

Junior Malik Hightower should
provide the offensive punch after
performing well enough to be the
SC Freshman of the Year two sea-
sons ago. In the words of head
coach Dwight Freeman, Marshall
is "going to be a lot more well
balanced this year."

‘4, UT-Chattanooga The Mocca-

sins were both regular season and
conferencetournament champs last
year. However, with the loss of
leading scorer Tim Brooks, the
team will be hurting in the offen-
sive category. Still, they could
play a major role if senior Chad
Copeland continues with his spec-
tacular three point shooting. UTC
also had a solid recruiting year.

taineers graduated the conference's

ing their scoring load to junior
forward Chad McLendon who led
the SC in rebounding last season.
ASU's weakness lies. in the its
depth. Head coach Tom Apke
said, "We hope going through the
growing pains of playing so many
young players like we did last sea-
son will reap benefits this year.
But, we have to replace the top
scorer in the league in Billy Ross.
That's a key for us."

6. Georgia Southern Graduation
gutted the Eagles' front line and
took away Charlton Young. How-
ever, head coach Frank Kems is —
optimistic. "We think we recruited
well," he said. "For us it's just
going to be a matter of gaining
experience, a maturation process.
Obviously, some of these new
people are going to have to plug
some holes for us to be success-
ful."

7. Furman Two Clemson trans-
fers should make the Paladinsmore
competitive than a yearago. Lack-
ing in quickness and athleticism
last season, the addition of
swingman Steve Harris should
make a difference.

8. The Citadel The Bulldogs are
in their second season under head
coach Pat Dennis who has been
preaching patience to his players.
That line should continue consid-
ering that the team is undersized
and lacking experience.

9. VMI The Keydets lost their last
16 games last season, a fact that
does not bode well for the upcom-
ingone. A young point-guard ori-
ented team, Coach Joe Cantafio
will have to look for leadership
from freshmen, unfortunately.

10. Western Carolina The Cata-
mounts have gone through five
coaches in nine years, deciding

‘ now to go with the experienced

Benny Dees, but they're still head-
ing for the cellar again this year.
