Interfraternity Council
members expressed differ-
ing opinions concerning the
possible institution of nonse-
lective eating clubs at David.
son, at a meeting with College
president, Samuel R. Spencer

Jr. Tuesday.

Speaking briefly at the
outset of the meeting, Spen-
cer stated that he was only
interested in the principle of
nonselectivity rather than
the mechanics of a particu-
lar proposal.

He said his recommenda-
tion to the trustees during
their meeting next Thursday
and Friday would concern the
idea of nonselective eating
clubs. ‘‘The responsibility

for working out the mecha- :*~ *

nics will come back to the
campus,”’ he: said.

The meeting then proceed-
ed with a collage of views
and opinions ranging from
willing acceptance’ to out-
right’ rejection of Spencer’s
proposal.

Some ‘students did voice
objections about the college
trying to legislate the social
life of the students. Spencer
replied by saying that he
felt the college should pro-

vide a _ social system in
which all the students: can
participate.

A fraternity president aie:
ed Spencer what the college
would say .about fraternities
going off campus. Spencer
replied, ‘‘ I don't know.”

Pikas Stun
Fraternities,

Open Doors

The Pi Kappa Alpha social
fraternity stole a march on
the fraternity reform move-
ment Tuesday by opening its
facilities to the use of. non-
member students at large.

Fraternity President Gary
Cash announced that any
student who wished to attend
could come to the house for
meals, parties, and recrea-
tion on a nonselective basis.

“We are trying to. phase
into the coming trend,’ Cash
said.

The Pikas’ open _invita-
tion. does not technical-
ly offer ‘fraternity mem-
bership,” since. that, would
violate rules of the national
chapter. But it offers to non-
members —- all
privileges. except the right
to vote in fraternity meet-
ings.

Any student who wishes

membership-

may board and party with
the Pikas, paying according
to. one of several financial
arrangements. \

“‘We will be on a inoney
for services rendered basis,”
Cash said. Those invited will
pay for board and parties a
week at a time, he added.

Founded in 1869, David-
son’s second oldest fraternity,
the Pikas are also one of Da-
vidson’s most liberal, accord-
ing to presidential assistant
Peter H. Hobbie.

“TI expected that if a move
comes in response to Spen-
cer’s plan, it would come
from a liberal group like

this one,” Hobbie said.

The Pikas’ open invitation
is expected to allow them to
lower each member’s board
bill, thus giving them a com-
petitive advantage among
other fraternities.

N.-C. 28036. Year-

The idea of permanent
random assignment of fresh-
men to the fraternities, pro-

_ Posed by the Student Life

report, created a stir among
the fraternity members.
Many felt freshmen should
have a choice in deciding to
which eating club they
would like to belong.

Other students’ raised the
question of timing. ‘‘This
year's freshmen came here
under the’ impression that
they could join a_ fratern-
ity,’’ said one student. ‘‘Now
if we change the system, it
seems as though we're pul-
ling the rug out from under
them."’

Another student countered
this argument by saying
“If. we do it now, we will
have three classes of guys
in fraternities to help make
the. change.”’

The idea of 100% bidding
procedures was mentioned,
but Spencer questioned
whether national fraterniti-
es would go along with this.

A fraternity president sug:
gested keeping six fraterni:-
ties on campus and open-
ing up the other houses as
non-selective eating clubs.
Spencer raised the problem,
“Who will decide who stays
and who does not?’’

One student proposed that
freshmen be randomly as-
signed -in various houses
where he would remain for
two or three months.

By that time it was hoped
he would have become fa-
miliar with the various fra-
ternities. ‘He then would
have the opportunity to
change to another ch if
he prefered.

He added it was still a °

matter of controversy wheth-

to reveal ‘sources under

Burts declined to be quot-

attacks on the newspaper,
but sources close to the SLC

he warned SLC members

ARA Slater food service
-has ‘scheduled a food evalu-
ation survey to be conducted
at. the Davidson cafeteria

ager Klaus Kleeberg, is to

given’ to all ‘boarding stu-
dents,” thoSe with meal’ tic-
kets: Students who do not pre-
sently hold meal tickets will
not be: allowed to take part
_in_ the’ evaluation, -

SLC recommendations that
the college stop active en-
forcement of its rules
against drugs. The SLC was
reported to have suggested
that the college use counsel-
ing rather than punishments
to discourage drug use.

Burts said the Code clause
against drug possession re-
mains in effect. ‘‘Everyone
has a responsibility to re-
port violations,’’ he said.

“There are not good guys
and bad guys,'’ he added.
“We are all on the same
side.'' Burts noted that “the
students themselves’’ voted
to approve th® Code.

Washington Square College

tures, both at 8 p.m. in
Hodson Hall of the Cunning:
ham Fine Arts. Center.

He will speak Tuesday on
“Change’’ and Thursday on
“Style and Value.’ He will
also discuss modern art, Do-

natello, ‘Rennaissance art,
(Middle Eastern art, and
other topics: with several
art classes.

Janson was educated at
German universities and
later at Harvard. After
teaching at several institu-
tions for a few years each,
he joined the faculty of NYU

-in 1949,

He is ‘the only art historian
to have twice received the
highest award of the College
Art Association~ for ‘‘the
most distinguished work of
art historical scholarship in
the U. S. and Canada,”’ in
1952. for ‘“‘Apes and Ape
Lore in the Middle Ages”
and in 1957 for ‘‘The Sculp-
ture-of Donatello.”

But he is probably - best

@xknown for his popular text-

book, ‘‘History of Art,"’ of
which more than a million
copies have been sold.

To Choose Menu

The evaluation sheets are
composed largely of prefer-
ential _ listings concerning
types of meals desired by the
Students. Over 25 , possible
selections, to’ be rated as
“like,” ‘‘don’t like,” or ‘don’t
know,” are listed for stu-
dents to evaluate,. .

The evaluations will be
scanned by a computer, and
the resufts of each individual
Slater food service operation
will be returned to the re-
spective manager for help in
making out menus.

“This service has been
conducted by Slater for sey-
eral vears now,” Kleeberg

* menu

said. “It is very worthwhile
Since it helps the cafeteria
manager determine what
foods the students want to
eat.”

Kleeberg sai that the re-
sults of the evaluation are
“followed religiously. We try
to make at least two heavily
preferred dishes ayailable at
every meal.”

The survey will be con.
ducted at the evening meal
Tuesday night, Kleeberg
said. “The sooner we have
the evaluations, the sooner
we will be: able to make the

what ‘.the students
want.” =
