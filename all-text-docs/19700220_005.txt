the Pecorak brothers on the
Davidson basketball scene
as T. J. Pecorak announced
his intention to sign a grant

in aid to Davidson at the

Duke game Wednesday

night.
Pecorak will join his

brother John, who currently
leads the freshman team in
rebounding while averaging
17 points a game.

T.J., a 6-6 forward, select-
ed Davidson after sorting
through offers from over 100
school including several
‘Southeastern and Atlantic
Coast Conference teams.

A three year starter at
Fairfax, Va., at Woodson
High, T.J. seems certain to
become the first Cavalier
player in history’ to score
more than 1000 career
points.

T,. J._is hitting for 25

ing 14 rebounds per outing.
