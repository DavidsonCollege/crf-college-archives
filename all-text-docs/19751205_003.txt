g Murphey, Petrowski seek
§ midwifery research funds

By LARRY MIMMS
Managing Editor

Davidson College juniors
Ruth Murphey and Nancy
Petrowski have applied for 5
national fellowships to study
midwifery programs in Eng-
land and the United States.

Petrowski and Murphey
seek Rockefeller, Joseph P.
Kennedy Jr., NATO and Win-
ston Churchill fellowships to
investigate the established
midwifery program in Eng-
land. This study in England
will be only the first phase of
their overall plan.

The second phase of their
project will be a study of the
embryonic midwifery program
is the United States. They
have sent an application to the
National Science Foundation
to obtain a Student Oriented

YMCA disorganization

(Continued from page 1)

Davidson and its Ada Jenkins
community center. Many
YMCA members work at the
center, but the programs there
are not responsible to the Y.

“I think the Y has two
problems that contribute to its
disorganization,’’ said Good-
house. ‘‘First there is a lack of
interest in the Y. There wasn’t
a concerted effort made this
year to drum up student
interest. Although we had a
pretty good turnout at the
activities fair, we didn’t do
much of a job keeping the
people we got. I think the fact
that there isn’t much interest
in the Y is reflective of the
student body as a whole.

“In the 1960’s people were
willing to get involved and do
something for other people. I
don’t think that is true any-
more,” continued Goodhouse.

Gary Stewart, who is in
charge of the depot activities,
is attempting to make the
depot a kind of coffee house for
junior high school children. He

describes the planning of the
depot as a ‘‘one man job”’ and
seems to agree with Good-
house that the student body
has lost interest in the YMCA.

“Davidson is an excellent
place for going out on your
own and doing what you want
to do. Several people in the Y
just don’t seem to have the
initiative. Basically, it seems
that if you have people here at
Davidson doing things that
they know they can’t get a
grade in, they aren’t going to
be too interested,’’ said
Stewart.

Many programs run them-

selves once they are set up. In.

this past year the upper
eschalon of the officers, the
people who do the planning,
has been fairly unorganized or
at least informally organized,’’

said Jones.
“The Y has always been a

quiet organization and it
would like to remain that way.
I don’t think it can stay that
way,” continued Goodhouse.
Goodhouse suggests a sal-
vation forthe ailing YMCA.

He believes that the Y has to
try to appeal more strongly to
potential and existing mem-
bers.

‘‘When people were there,
willing to do something, when
they believed in the Y, they
were not given anything to do.
I think the Y is going to have
to try to attract people ac-
tively and become more of a
political organization.

Murphey and Petrowski.

hope to demonstrate a need for
midwifery services in the
United States and propose a
feasible midwifery program in
the United States by exam-
ining England’s midwifery
situation and the young mid-
wifery programs in the U.S.

‘Midwifery programs do
not only provide registered
nurses for delivering babies. A
midwifery program includes
prenatal advising and care and
help with child development
up to an age of six months,”’
said Murphey.

Murphey and Petrowski be-
came interested in midwifery
while working in the Obste-
trics and Gynecology Dept. of
Spartanburg General Hospital
this past summer.

“We saw case after case of
birth complications due to
poor prenatal care and malnu-
trition. Two-thirds of infant
defects and retardation are
due to poor prenatal and
postnatal care. The present
medical community does not
provide this care for a ma-
jority of mothers and infants,’’
said Petrowski.

Murphey stated that infant
mortality rates in the United
States are very high compared
with rates in countries like

” England and Sweden which

have established midwifery
programs. Infant mortality is
especially high in the south
and rural areas.

“A great majority of physi-
cians are located in urban
areas leaving the rural areas of
the U.S. without adequate
care. Also, in a city like
Atlanta, it costs. the parents
about $350 for a hospital birth
if there are no complications.
If complications occur, birth
can be a more expensive
process than burial,’ said
Petrowski.

What Murphey and Petrow-
ski want to see is a change
within the American Medical
Association (AMA) commu-
nity.

“There are no health depart-
ments or laws that say mid-
wifery is illegal. The only
static against midwifery
comes from the AMA commu-
nity, which is afraid of mid-
wife competition.

“Midwives will not try to
take business away from doc-
tors, but rather fill a great
medical gap in poor urban and
rural areas. Midwives would
be registered nurses who do
not act alone but as part of a
midwifery center. The center
