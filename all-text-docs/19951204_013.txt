UNUSUAL ART

The Owling Table Series display

leaves observers

By Mary Tow es ALLISON
Staff Writer

Before even beginning this
article, let me say that I think art is
a wonderful form of expression
and that judgement of it is defi-
nitely in the eye of the beholder.
The James Bumgardener exhibit
inthe VACis... interesting (from
my point of view). Probably not
something I’d want to hang in my

living room at home; but neverthe-

less, an engaging conversation
piece. The paintings are all oil in
this collection whose name, The
Owling Table Series, is as unique
as the paintings themselves. The
colors are bold with a mixture of
blue, green, orange, white, and red.

A cardinal trait in all of
Bumgardner’s paintings seems to
be the omnipresence of a pink fig-
ure (from what I could gather, it
was the likeness of a woman).
There are owls painted discreetly
somewhere in all of the paintings.
Their significance, I’m not quite
sure of. There may be some influ-
ence of taxidermy in the paintings
but I don’t know what kind of
interaction stuffed owls would have
with pink women. There’s some-
thing to think about if you get tired
of studying. Ihaven’t spenta lot of

time pondering it, but it would’

probably be pretty funny if some-
body did.

One thing I did like a lot about
the paintings, whether they were
about taxidermy or not, was/that
they were cheerful. They really
brightened up the gallery and even
though they were violently abstract,
I felt peaceful looking at them and
wondering about the symbolism
that existed (ifany) in the art. Pretty
neat stuff. I encourage anyone to
go over to the VAC and check it
out. If you haven’t been to the

Visual Arts Center yet, go, regard-
less of your desire to see
Bumgardner’s work. The VAC isa
work of art in itself, and those who
work there are equally as pleasing.

Upon entering the gallery, I
took a gander at the information
plaque the VAC has about the fea-

tured artist and the art; unfortu-’

nately, it didn’t help me decipher
exactly what the paintings meant,
but the interesting tidbits of infor-
mation supplied were worth read-
ing. James Bumgardner, the painter
behind The Owling Table Series,
is a native North Carolinian who
studied in New York City under
notable artists Milton Avery and
Hans Hofman. The Owling Table
Series was completed in 1959; to
view the collection is unique be-
cause many of Bumgardner’s
works were destroyed in a studio

fire. His works are currently dis-
played not only in our fine arts
facility but also in the Virginia
Museum of Fine Art in Richmond,
the Chrysler Museum in Norfolk,
Virginia, and the North Carolina
Museum of Art in Raleigh, from
which Davidson received the works °
on loan.

The artist is currently a pro-
fessor at Virginia Commonwealth
University in Richmond; he has
taught there for thirty-eight years.
Davidson has also bought a small
piece of Bumgardner’s art called
Pink Nude #4. I must say that this
is one of the more tame (and most
appealing to me, if it matters at all)
of the paintings shown. It looks
more like a landscape than any-
thing nude, and doesn’t appear to
be a part of The Owling Table
Series.

Southwest Grilled

Chicken

gives pizzazz to your palette

By Ros Kosick &
Jay SHULTZ
Chefs-in-Residence

Over Thanksgiving break we
traveled to Texas in search of the
ultimate southwestern dish. I think
we found it. This recipe will adda
little spice to your ordinary grilled
chicken. To begin you will need
the following ingredients:

4-6 boneless, skinless chicken
breasts

1 cup of chunky salsa (mild, me
dium, or hot)

1/4 cup dijon mustard

2 tablespoons of lime juice or juice

from a large lime.
Small container of sour cream

Mix the half cup of salsa with
the dijon mustard and the lime
juice in a large bowl or baking
dish. We recommend using hot
salsa. Rinse the chicken under
cold water, removing any un-
wanted fat. Place chicken in the
mixture, making sure the chicken
is well coated. Cover with plastic
wrap and refrigerate for at least
thirty minutes. Preheat grill and
cook chicken about 5-7 minutes a
side over medium heat. Top each

piece of chicken with a tablespoon _

of salsa and a little bit of sour

cream if desired. A piece of lime
may also be added for decoration
and for squeezing over the chicken.

A great appetizer to go with
this dish would be nachos smoth-
ered with melted cheese. If you
haven’t figured out how to melt
cheese over nachos in your oven,
then we hope you have about five
dollars on your cat card so you can
get nachos at the outpost. As aside
dish we recommend white rice, or

‘if you are really fancy, maybe a

baked potato. I know it is Decem-
ber and it is hard to grill out in the

cold, but this week looks to be *

pretty nice, so go out and give this
recipe atry. “Til we cook again!
