THE NORTH CAROLINA GAME,

Unquestionably “It wasn't our day,”
to use the expression of one who was
closely watching the game with North
*Carolina last Saturday. A person could-
n't point out any reason “Why” the
game was going as it was and yet—it
was undoubtedly true. We all knew
full well that every man on our team
was giving the very best that was in him,
but against Davidson was a new Caro-
lina—a team which had been defeated
and humbled, brow-beaten and abused,
and now, with the Virginia game scarce-
ly ten days away, they arose in all their
power and strength and plaved as thev
have never played before. They played
hard, and deserved their victory.

But when the last whistle had blown,
every Davidson man, with his faith in
the team fully as strong as ever, formed
in line and with the old time “pep”
marched back through town with more
spirit than is many times shown after a
victorv. This is the evidence of the truc
Davidson spirit. which shows that Dav-
idson stands behind her representatives
in victory and in defeat.

Te has been a good season. and new all
eves are turned toward the Wake Forest
game on Thanksgiving. This game is
alwave full of interest—to see if David-
son will be able to keep unbroken the
long line of victories over that institu-
tion, and this vear it is looked forward
to with esnecial interest on account of
the class of ball that Wake Forest has
been plaving.

We but echo the sentiment of the
camnus, the facultv and the alumni when
we sav that never has there been a great-
er feeline of lovalty for the team and our
coaches than is now nresent on the eve
of the final game of the season.

CIVIC LEAGUE FLOWER SHOW

Tuesday, November 0, the ladies of
the Civic League held in their hall a flow-
er show. Chrysanthemums and_ ferns
were much in evidence and exceptionally
beautiful. Mesdames Elliott, J. N.
Thompson and Withers had the most
beautiful displays. Miss Bonnie Shelton
presided at the lemonade counter. Mes-
dames Brady, J. W. McConnell, Shel-
ton and W. R. Grey supervised the at-
traction, and many visitors found their
way during the hours of 3 to 9 p. m. to
the Civic League rooms and enjoyed the
spectacle.

LETTER OF APPRECIATION
FROM DR. SHEPHERD

Dr. Henry E. Shepherd, who spoke.

here on Davidson College Day last year,
in appreciation of what Davidson did
for him as a student, and because of the
affection he has always felt for her,
writes:

“In every stage of her development
from her very origin, Davidson has
maintained her academic integrity in-
violate, and has kept herself unspotted
from the temptations which in no sphere
of our contemporary life assume a more
malignant form than in the educational
world. In seasons of exigency, in per-
iods of revolution, she has never failed
to adhere to her lofty ideals, in scholar-
ship, as well as in the moral sphere. At
no time has she become a worshiper of
the sensuous and of the material, or sac-
rificed her purity in the absorbing quest
of the things which perish with the
using. Blending into harmony faith,
reverence, comprehensive and wisely
guarded acquirements in literature,
science. and philosophy, the college can
assuredly claim, as it assuredtv deserves,
the support. co-operation and generous
patronage of the church with which it is

associated and of the country in which Clean Towels, Sharp Razors

it serves as an enlightening and inspiring
power.”

OLD PUBLICATIONS FOUND.

In a recent search in the old library,
Miss Shaw discovered several copies of
i magazine, and two issues of a paper,
whose publication dates back many years

the

ago. The magazine found was
“Davidson Monthly,” “devoted — to
Science, Literature and Art.” It. first

appeared in’ 1870, sixteen years before
Volume T of the Davidson College
Magazine. It was a student publication,
which fact makes it the ancestor of THE
Davinsonian rather than of the Maga-
zine. “The Davidson Monthly” lived
only two years, and all the copies have
been found except those for October
1871, January 1872, and February 1872.

The paper discovered was ‘The Dav-
idson College Enterprise.” but only two
copies of this have been secured, these
being for Tanuary 18 and February 1,
1884. This is a small four page week-
ly, and was published by a student as a
money making scheme. Hence it was
not a regular student body publication.
Tt contains news items and contributions
on various subjects from students.
