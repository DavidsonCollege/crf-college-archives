A DAVIDSON DISGRACE.

Davidson's student body is advertised
as “unique among institutions of learn
ing. | The ‘students are a picked
body of men, representing the finest
home training in all the South. Prob-
ably two-thirds of them are the sons of
church officers, representing every state
in the South, On the average, about
nine out of ten are themselves pro
fessing Christians, and one In every five

has chosen the ministry of the Gospel.

as his life's work. [{ is not too much to
say, then, that the Davidson student
body represents the flower of Southern
culture and home training.”

The Davidson student body és unique.
Its moral stamina, and — standards of
purity, sobriety, and gentlemanly con-
duct are admittedly far above the aver-
age, and place it high in the list of edu-
cational institutions of the South. But
with all of its virtues, there are also
vices; and one of them, asin of omission,
is a blot upon the name of a Christian
community and a disgrace to a denomi-
national school. Te is the attitude to-
ward the daily chapel services and espe-
cially toward the singing there.

It is true that that compulsory attend-
ance at any meeting, be it religious, edu-
cational or for amusement, would prob-
ably prove burdensome to the liberty-
loving American; but in our attitude of
mere indifferent existence during the
morning period of divine service we be-
come almost sacrilegious, It is pure care-
lessness, surely, for a student body like
ours could not and would not intention-
ally so defile a service of praise and
thanksgiving to God.

Tt is not that we can not sing, for it
has been demonstrated in the Thursday
night Y. M. C. A. meetings that we can.
The majority of the student body can
sing, and will sing; but discouraging re-
marks by a few leading (downward)
spirits. tend to throw a wet blanket over
the entire service.

The adjourned meeting of Concord
Presbytery, which was called to meet at
Davidson, September 30, met in the
Davidson church. The only visiting
ministers were Rev, Mr. West, of Cen-
tre church, and Rev. Dr. Clark, of the
Salisbury church.

The purpose of this meeting was ta
vive an opportunity to any men in col-
leee, who are looking forward to the
ministry as a life work. to put them-
selves under the care of Presbytery.

There were three men who came for-
ward to be taken under the care of Con-
cord Preshytery—Jones and Foster, of
the Davidson church, and Reid Poole,
of the Mooresville church. Both of the
former are Freshmen in the college.

Another matter acted upon at this
meeting of Presbvtery was the changing
of the next regular meeting of Presby-
terv from Salisbury to Marion.

Presbytery adjourned after a short
but important meeting to meet again at
the call of the moderator.
