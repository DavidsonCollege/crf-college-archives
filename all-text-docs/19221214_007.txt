prominent citizen of Winston-Salem, died
in Long's Sanatorium in Statesville. He had

heen in ill health for some time, and had been
constantly under the care of his physician
for three or four weeks. Death was due di-
rectly to kidney and heart trouble, which
followed an attack of influenza. On Satur-
day last his condition suddenly became very
serious,’ and Mrs, Patterson at
summoned to his side. She was with him
when the end came.

The funeral services of Mr. Patterson
were held at the home of his only surviving
sister, Mrs, A. L. Coble, in Statesville, Tues-

The burial was at the old Patterson home
place in Happy Valley,
the Chapel of Rest.

All during his life, Mr.
Patterson was a lover of the mountains, and
it is in response to his request that his rest-
ing place will be in Happy Valley, where so
many of his days had been spent. He was
the owner of a large tract of land in Happy
Valley and nothing gave him greater joy
than to visit there and dwell for a while in
the quiet mountain country, the beauties of
which always appealed to him strongiy ana
won his tender interest.

say Patterson. He was born in Salem on

see. They met while Mrs. Patterson was at-
tending Salem College. There were no chil-
dren. Receiving his early education in the
schools of Winston-Salem, Mr. Patterson

uated in the class of 1878. On leaving Da-
vidson, he entered the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill for the study of
law, and after receiving his degree and
qualifying for the profession, he located at
Winston-Salem, his life-long home, for the
upbuilding of his active career.

Mr. Patterson was always an active citi-
zen, striving to bear his share of every
movement looking to the betterment and de-
velopment of his community, State and coun-
try. Mr. Patterson’ was a devoted member

cancy in the lives of the many who knew and
honored him.
