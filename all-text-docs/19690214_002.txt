Davidsonian Goals: Professionalism And Rebellion

This, gentle reader, is our last
editorial.

A new editorial ‘“‘we’—perhaps
more competent, certainly more
eager—is already crowding us off
the scene. They begin reforming
the world and Davidson College
next week.

Once we were eager, too. Eager
and a bit brash, and not a little
naive about the place of a student-
run newspaper on this campus.

But that was a year ago. We are
eager no more.

Over the last year,we’ve been
called a multitude of things —
meddlesome, reckless, untrust-
worthy, irhumane, dull, irrele-
vant and irreverent—to name just
a few.

We are, we’ve been told, fuzzy-
thinking intellectuals. Or a wise-
ass. A dumb-dumb.

We've been painted every color
in the spectrum, but most often
yellow and red. Sometimes only

pink.

We've been threatened with
lawsuits and other, more base at-
tacks on various parts of our anat-
omy.

And a prominent trustee once
ordered us not to “go off half-
cocked and stir up controversy.”
We ought to be watching educa-
tional television instead, he. said.

All of these were expected,
though: they come with the job.
Their absence would undoubtedly
mean that THE DAVIDSONIAN
is not functioning as it should.

We realize, you see, that we
have often been extreme. That

invites reaction. We confess also
to being occasionally misleading
and, at times, inconsistent. A
couple of times we have been flat-
out wrong.

Those invite reaction, too.

But what we haven't gotten used
to in a year’s time is the incredible
ignorance—the distressing naivete
—of the college community about
the role of a. student-run news-
paper at Davidson.

Somehow; somewhere—certain-
ly not from us—many people here
have gotten the notion that THE
DAVIDSONIAN exists for reasons
other than printing the news and
raising hell.

This newspaper, they think,
should reflect the college only in
the best possible light. If some-
thing nice or praiseworthy hap-
pens, their perverted theory goes,
THE DAVIDSONIAN should shout
it for all the world to hear. But
if something not-so-nice were to
happen . , . why, to wave the col-
lege’s dirty linen in plain view is
pure blasphemy!

Those people are only sadly
mistaking us for the college news
bureau, that 9-to-5, coat-and-tie
outfit paid to grind out administra-
tion-approved white-washes on
pretty yellow paper.

We don’t have any yellow pa-
per, and we think such notions
are ridiculous.

You can’t be a “good guy” and
a good newspaper, too.

The naivete about THE DAVID-
SONIAN doesn’t stop there either.

It runs, unfortunately, much deep-

er.

Most students love to hear us
trying to lecture the administra-
tion or scold the faculty. or make
fun of ODK. That's o.k. But when
we strike. closer to home, then
it’s not o.k. anymore.

Maybe the truth hurts.

There is this idea in a lot of
student body leaders that THE
DAVIDSONIAN should be every-
body’s pal, skipping along, arm-
in-arm, with the student ‘‘govern-
ment,” the football team, the IFC
or what-have-you toward some

But on some issues— admissions
policy, fraternities and compul-
sory ROTC, for instance—we don’t
really know where the student
body as a whole stands. If there
is a concensus on these issues,
and others, then we don’t know
what it is.

The fact is, we don’t have the
time to go out and take a poll
every time we take a stand. on
some new issue. And if we did, we
would be grossly violating the
standards of professionalism un-
der which we try to operate.

THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE STUDENTS

kind of nebulous nirvana. We
should, this theory says, be a con-
stant cohort in the fight for the
student Cause.

What these students haven't
bothered to do, however, is to
figure out precisely what the
Cause is. Abolition of the curfew
and compulsory chapel, liberali-
zation of drinking rules and open
dorms policy, the need fora new
snack bar—maybe those fit under
the catagory of the Cause. If they
do, then in the last year we have,
in some respects, been fighting
for it.

This professionalism is at the
heart of the matter. Simply stat-
ed, it’s why we act the way we do.

A professional newspaper ga-
thers the news and reports it—
straight and hard, regardless of
whether it happens to be “con-
venient” for the community lead-
ers and without wondering “how
the trustees will react to it.”

THE DAVIDSONIAN, over the
last few years, has tried very hard
to be professional, ‘

In many respects, we have suc-
ceeded; we have the awards to
prove it. But in others—because

we are immature and_ inexper-
ienced and because there are not
enough hours in the week to be
creative and because we cannot
seem to arouse a lethargic: stu-
dent body—we have failed.

With those who object to our
way of doing things, we agree
that it is unfortunate that the
“outside world” often has only
THE DAVIDSONIAN for its source
of campus news. Perhaps we
should have two student-run news-
papers.

To those who complain that we
“manufacture” news, we offer
this: any newspaper manufactures
news, in one sense or another.
For good or ill, the “news” is, after
all, usually what the news media
make it.

With those who complain that
we are too serious, we are in par-
tial agreement. But as long as we
strive to operate on professional
guidelines, we will lend a certain
dignity, perhaps undeserved, to
campus events and organizations.

To those who think we are un-
representative, we cali attention
to the other five columns on page
two. We solicit—nay, covet—let-
ters, particularly those with other
points of view, and never in recent
years have we refused to print one
that was signed.

And finally, to those who find us
too liberal—extreme, some would
say—we would offer the reaction
of a distinguished Davidson alum-
nus when he returned to campus
last year for a visit:

“,.. I felt a bit unhappy with

what I saw. The question is: how
do you preserve Davidson's
strength and, at the same time,
bring the faculty and students in-
to realistic relations with our
messy and trying times? I've no
answer.”

We don’t have the whole answer
either—but we're looking. What
we've tried to do for thé last
year is suggest likely solutions.

That is why we want Davidson
to chunk its traditional view on
admissions policy and seek out
more diversity. Why we want the
college to arrange for the admis-
sion of female students. Why we
want our campus social set-up to
be revamped, Why we want our
ROTC program, without a doubt
one of the best and most flexible
in the country, to be bent a little
more and become voluntary. Why,
in short, our editorial policy is
often one of constructive rebel-
lion.

For our critics, there is no let-up
in sight. For the new editorial
“we’’ is likely to be just as extreme
and meddlesome and confounded
ornery as the old. If they aren't,
then they are not worth their
journalistic salt.

But if you still persist in your
objections, there is something
you can do: join the staff and im-
press your opinion on the editors.

The staff is completely open
and completely voluntary—and we
always need people. Just come up
to the office on the second floor
of the Union almost any night.

We'll be there until at least 3.

An Editor's Obituary

Personal friendship and much respect for Robbie
Hooker have prompted this tribute.

This is the obituary and eulogy for Rob, who is
stepping down as Editor-in-Chief of THE DAVIDSON-
IAN. For eight months this newspaper has been his

obsession.

Whatever competence and inter-
est this paper has demonstrated dur-
ing his editorship can be traced, to
a very large degree, to Rob’s own
competence as a journalist and to
his enthusiasm for his job.

That THE DAVIDSONIAN appear-
ed every Friday was in large mea-
sure due to Rob’s spending 30 hours

®
a week editing copy, writing editor- ad
ials, reading proof, attending meet-
ings—and a couple of times, actu-

ally delivering the papers in the
dorms himself, whenever the circulation people lous-
ed up.

This newspaper was his life.

Rob is one of those very rare people who are com-
-plete perfectionists. And if putting out the best news-
paper possible meant staying up to 3, 4, 5 a.m., then,
Rob would do it. He frequently did.

He would also get up and go to an 8 o'clock class
the next morning. He has spent countless weekends
studying when everybody else was out partying, sim-
ply because he had no other time to study.

This newspaper was Rob's sacrifice.

For no pay, and for very little glory, Rob did all
of this.

When you put your whole life into a job, criticism
is hard to take. Rob is thin-skinned; he took criticisms
of THE DAVIDSONIAN'S short-comings to heart.

Criticism hurt Rob in a very personal way, especi-
ally when the criticism was petty or unfounded, as
it often was.

As editor, many times Rob was pressured not to
print a story that he, as a journalist, thought should
be printed.

Rob printed the news that he thought was honest
news—stories about events that were actually news-
worthy. Sometimes the publicity made people sweat;
sometimes it made people mad.

With this last issue of Rob’s paper, I feel a sense
of loss. The paper loses a completely dedicated editor.

in another way, | feel another loss. This is my
last column, the last of my own personal tirades. I
will miss the writing, just as in June I will miss David-
son—the people and the institution.

My God, what can I bitch about then?

Walkout

To The Editor:

It is evident to almost
everyone that something
must be done to improve the
quality of assembly pro-
grams. Unfortunately, the
answer is not an easy one to
find. I cast my vote in favor
of voluntary chapel, but this
decision must come about in
an orderly way and not by
unnecessary radical means.

For a long time now, I
have watched student re-
sentment against compulsory
chapel grow. It has taken the
form of sleeping, reading
books and newspapers, and
even laughing at the speak-
er. But never have I seen
conduct more juvenile and
ridiculous than the walkout
staged last Thursday.

Fortunately, only about 75
persons were involved. so in
terms of what the leaders
expected, it was a complete
fiasco. Nonetheless, it dis-
gusts me that some David-
son students don’t have any
more respect for speakers
than their actions showed.

It is inconceivable to me
that after Dr. Spencer's
opening remarks anyone
could think of walking out.
Dr. Spencer, along with the
other members of the admin-
istration and faculty, realize
there is a problem and is
taking steps to do some-
thing about it.

The Code of Responsibility
has been used as an excuse
to justify the walkout. Some
fail to realize that responsi-
bility is a two-way street.

Half the students involved
allowed their emotions to
guide their actions, and I
doubt whether they would
make the same decision
again. In any case the stu-
dent body should take
another look at its future
goals, and then work with,
not against, the administra-
tion and faculty for desired
changes.

Tucker Says Relevance
Not Found At Davidson

To The Editor:

Last Wednesday night a
feeble effort to engage stu-
dents in a discussion con-
cerning the problems of Da-
vidson College was attempt-
ed. Feeble’’ implies not my
disagreement with those in-
volved in the Open End, but
rather the two or three-hour
time period granted to the
students not wholly caught
up in the Davidson dream.

Passionate Proposition Pressed

By SANDRA EARLEY
tn The Profile
(Agnes Scott)

Don't look now, girls, but
Davidson College is proposi-
tioning people. Yes. collec-
tively. They're looking for
coeds or at least their cam-
pus newspaper, THE DA
VIDSONIAN, would have you
think so.

It all started way back last
fall with a series of editor.
jals. It has progressed now
to the point of informal polls
to measure campus opinion
on the subject and inter.
views with the coliege pre-
sident concerning a merger
with suitable girls’ schools.

In an editorial entitled,
“Where the Girls Aren't,”

the reasons favoring such a
merger were stated: ‘“‘David-
son needs girls. Academical-
ly, they would contribute
new viewpoints and new
competition. And socially...
well, we need to learn to
judge a girl on criteria other
than the color of her dress,
the length of her hair and
how much she puts out.”

An interview with the col-
lege president in the Nov. 1,
1968, edition of THE DAVID.
SONIAN quoted him as say-
ing. ‘‘My position at this
point is that I am sympathe-
tic te the idea of coeduca-
tion.”

On this hapoy note, another
editorial, ‘It Takes Two,
Baby,” in the same issue
propositioned the first school.

It noted that Sweet Briar is
making rumblings about co-
education, then suggested
the two school get together.

The next two editorials
called attention to what other
school are doing. citing stu-
dies at Lehigh University
and Princeton which showed
coeducation preferable. ~

Like that identification
bracelet every girl in the
seventh grade wore at some-
time during the year, the
most recent Davidsen pro-
position has gone out to
Mary Baldwin. This editorial
said, “There are good deals
at Mary Baldwin . . . Bald.
.win is a merger ‘mate that
any haughty bachelor would
be proud to get.

Tt has |.

satisfactory academic stand.
ards and a student body of
750 women."

Well, ladies, it's happened
again — somewhere along
the line when they were pas
sing out propositions, we got
left out. And we can't even
drink in our dorms.

Maybe merry ole David.
son should look south rather
than north. Atlanta is a very
nice city and there are 750
of us with better than ‘‘satis-
factory academic _ stand-
ards.’ Besides, we might
even put on our pretty
please for them. Not only
that, we already have self-

scheduling of exams. which.

Davidson students are cur-
rently striving for.

For me to enumerate the
things I consider wrong with
Davidson would require more
time than. Kimbrough has
taught here.

How about a college? We
have Burts running around
trying to write down the
names of the heinous sinners
who cut chapel and _ the
average salary of Davidson's
janitors is less than $70 per
man per week.

Shaw Smith tells us that
it’s a College Union rather
than a Student Union and a
Union Board member re-
marks that it is ‘brash and
discourteous’’ to have a
“peace” table next to the
Marines.

Clean sheets on a mattress
enforced by Sgt. Penley and
polished shoes and briss at
ROTC drill may mean ‘good
deals" and a commission
while thousands of yellow
people are dead and thous-
ands of domestic blacks
sleep with rats.

Student  sesponsibility
wellmeaning papa and profs
means attention during aw-
ful assemblies and-we get
two nigras a year to dent
the waspish image and
counter-service only to non.
student blacks in ‘‘public’’
accommodation. A_ foreign

student to play tennis and
Homer promises a Duke
game soon.

If Davidson were burned
and replaced by a marijua-
na farm, better would the
humanitarian instinct pro-
sper.

Davidson's Fuzzy Destination

Vespers. Monday chapels. Suspension for drinking.
These former hallmarks of Davidsoniana are as fo-
reign to most students as national fraternities and
Saturday classes will be to undergraduates of the
uture.

Few students can remember the stir created years
ago when an Honor Court member turned in a frater-
nity brother for possession of a beer can in his ear.
The student involved was suspended.

Or better yet, remember those arguments against
abolishing Vespers? If you don’t, then change the
wording in some of the arguments for compulsory
chapels and voila.

And for all the criticisms of student government
and its devotees, Joe Murphy and Peter Hobbie bear
little resemblance to the smiling but inert people
who have represented the student body at alumni
luncheons for years.

Over the years, the changes have been generally
accepted. As a result there is such an, air of change
around here that everyone has excepted fluctuation
as a normal state of affairs.

Nearly every candidate who put up a poster made
some reference to “the time of change” here at David-
son. I suspect many of them have little idea what this .
state of change involves or what it may ultimately

ring.

Through all this change, I suspect Davidson really
doesn’t know what it wants to be or should be. In
short, this school is experiencing an identity crisis.
. Davidson has had this crisis on a low level for years.
‘The Princeton of the South.” That's what supporters
of the school have called it for years. I guess they
figure that since both Davidson and Princeton were
founded by Presbyterians, this in some way bound
the glory of one to the other. It’s like tracing your
ancestry back to William the Conqueror.

But seriously, must Davidson always pattern itself
after other schools? Must it try to make itself into
something it is not? Such a coursé ought to be label-
ed “The Duke Syndrome.”

Sometime soon, someone here must decide whether
there is a place for a small, church-related basically
middle class college, or whether social demands have
made all institutions except the mass-related ones ir-
relevant. Should Davidson drop church affiliation just
because it is a secular age?

Should Davidson lower admission standards, or
should it remain a college where academic prowess
and intellectual ability stand higher than color of skin?

Up to now, it seems that more eyes are fixed on the
road than on the destination.

Kaylor, Newman: Appeals
Court Is Not That Powerful

To The Editor:

The article in last week's
DAVIDSONIAN _ concerning
the judicial opinions render-
ed by the Court of Appeals
may well have been mislead-
ing for many people.

Aside from the question of
the merits or demerits of the
opinions themselves, the Re-
gulations Court does not re-
cognize the authority of the
Court of Appeals either to
hear appeals from the Re-
gulations Court or to inter-
pret the Code of Responsi-
bility.

The Code of Responsibility
has been accepted by both
students and faculty and ap-

proved by the trustees, and
therefore the judicial sys-
tem which it contains is con-
sidered competent to ad-
judicate cases and to inter.
pret the code.

The Court of Appeals has
no recognized competence at
all, since the SGA Constitu-
tion which provides for it
has not been accepted as
yet by the faculty or trus.
tees. Therefore members of
the college community would
be well advised to regard
any pronouncements of the
Court of Appeals as merely
the opinions of those students
who make it up and not as
having any binding force.

One might note also that

if the Court of Appeals
should be given the powers
outlined in the proposed
SGA Consititution, we might

-as_ well dispense with the

student Senate, the faculty.
the administration and the
trustees, since the Court of
Appeals would be assumed
competent to govern the in
stitution — which, of course.
is one of the ‘minor’ pro-
blems holding up the ap.
proval of the SGA Constitu
tion. .
