‘Two Freshmen Fire |
| Complete Targets TE W DENT

The rifle firing for the freshmen on the

out-door range is progressing satisfactorily, |
with more than half the class finished by the
Easter holidays. The first perfect scores |
were made by J. K. Cook and M. Gilmore. |
With good weather and good scores all firing
should be completed by the 24th of April.

Since becoming more familiar with the

Springfield rifle the members of the class are
finding the out-door work less difficult than
the .22 calibre gallery firing earlier in the
year. They seem to enjoy and get a kick out
of the firing, as well as working in the “pits.”
The kick has been especially noticeable, and
“several have been telling afterward of the,
| great trenches their elbows dug on the firing
| Hine every time the gun went off. Several
swelled lips also attest the fact that the gun
was not held exactly according to specifica-
tions laid down in training regulations.
' The winning place in the Fourth Corps
' Arca gallery rifle shoot went to Georgia Tech.
While the local team did not place so high,
winning eighth place, they did make a very
creditable showing, considering the condition
of the rifles. Better scores are expected
next year, as there will be new rifles for all
men firing.

No report has been received from the
William Randolph Hearst Trophy firing.
The scores sent in by the local team, con-
sisting of Webb, J. B.; Alexander, A. W.;
Brown, E. E.; Short, T. L., and Abernathy,
R. G., will place high. Webb has held high
scores in all matches fired here this year.

dent body, an#-his popularity has endured
down to the present day. This is attested
by the large number, of students who enroll

lead the student body next year| Jim, like
most other leaders, has proven himself a
leader in athletics and in other activities as
well. He is a leader morally and has taken
