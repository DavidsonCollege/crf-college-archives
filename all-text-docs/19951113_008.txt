Minors and the liberal arts

This Monday we all should
receive our course registration
packets for next semester. For
seniors, it will be their last ever
such Davidson ritual. For others, it
is usually: a) anticipation of your
next semester along the following
thought process: “Allright, I got a
1.42 this semester. I'll just work
real hard the next eight semesters

and get all A’s the rest of my time *

at Davidson. Mmmm... (1.42+
4.0x7)/8 = 3.67!! Allright!!!
Swimming Pools! Movie Stars!
Harvard Law here I come!!!!" b)
“Allright!!! Choosing Courses!!!
Fun with my advisor, my parents,
and my mind. Sock it to me Liberal
Arts!!!! orc) For most of us, “gosh,
I get to pick four more courses out
of all those choices. It would be
nice to to take both math and En-
glish, but I have to decide on a
major quickly. So many choices.
So little time. Oh what to do!? Oh
what to do?”
For many of the students that
fall under the last category, their
_ Salvation/solution might lie in the
realm of minors. Before getting
into the specifics of this issue, I
must preface the rest of the article
by saying that this is an incredibly
complex topic that can not have all
its intricacies, positions, and pros
and cons expressed here. The best
debate about this topic will occur
between faculty, staff, and students
on campus wide level. I intend to
highlight only some of the advan-
tages and disadvantages of minors
through the endorsement of the
current student proposal for mi-
nors.

First things first: students re-
ally want minors. Last year hun-
dreds of students expressed ap-
proval of the institution of minors

into the curriculum. Less than 5%

of the student body expressed dis-
satisfaction with the prospect of
minors.

After near unanimous student
approval, the proposal went to a
faculty sub-committee on educa-
tional affairs, and it moved for-
ward for complete faculty vote.
After much debate and discussion
the proposal lost by some 10 votes.
Faculty cited that minors might
compromise the liberal arts ideal,
increase parental pressures on stu-
dents, and lead to a compromise of
teaching efficacy at the upper level
since such classes are usually semi-
nar in fashion and require a very
small class size

top 50 colleges in the nation, over
65% offer minors. Most of these
colleges are also deeply commit-
ted to the liberal arts. The granting
of an overwhelming student and
parental demand will “look” better
than preserving a liberal arts cause.
Remember, no one is forced to
take minors. It is just always nice
to have that option available.
Still, students should take
heart. The faculty does have an
excellent reason for restricting
minors. Small liberal arts colleges
just do not have a capability for
restricting minors. The teachers
are dedicated, hard working, and

each department, institutes aGPA
requirement, and ensures minors
can not overlap with double ma-
joring and concentrations. This
proposal should be accepted. It
leads to the possibility of a biology
major minoring in art and getting a
more comprehensive education in
the latter through a structured mi-
nor. Their diploma and resume
will show more clearly their broad
liberal arts emphasis than just say-
ing “along with my major, I took a
lot of courses in this...”

Now, departments with
willing faculty and a few number
of majors will be able to have sub-
stantive enroll-

to be most ef-
fective. Mi-
nors would put

majors and reject minors on the -

basis of sacrificing course diver-
sity are ideologically conflicting.
The possibility of increased paren-
tal pressure will always exist with
or without minors. Parents prone
to such acts will still say “all right

bunch of Economics courses any-
way.”

Also, parents do pay the tu-

Also, as stated previously, there is
the inevitable dilution of teaching
efficacy at the upper level due to
increased student enrollment in:
those classes. This reasoning is
probably why only six of the top 20
liberal arts colleges have minors.
Practically, minors would almost
be impossible to institute while
maintaining our high quality of
education.

So, we are at a crossroads.
The new major proposal makes the

Hootiegrungification

What did the Charlotte radio
industry do during the pre-Hootie
and pre-grunge age? Now, I have
nothing against Hootie and the
Blowfish; however, if they could
get out of my car radio I'd really
appreciate it. I don’t care if they
are going blind looking at some
girl while sitting on a fence hold-
ing Bob’s hand!

Because of this
hootigrungification of the airwaves
recently, I’ ve been scared to choose
radio over tapes. Sometimes I get
in my car and want something pre-
dictable. A tape can provide such
stability; tapes eradicate specula-
tion about song selection and or-
der. But, when I feeling a little
crazy, I’m ready to risk the un-
known of the radio.

Yet, you never know what’s
in store these days on the old dial.
Last year, 92.3 was the old reliable
of the airwaves. . Promoting its
lone sponsor “Liquid Bullet,” 92.3
played a variety of quality tunes

with a minimum of chat.

Now, however, I’m in a con-
stant state Of scanning. Even in
other peoples’ cars, I must keep
checking different channels be-
cause I’m sure there is a great song
on out there somewhere and it’s
just a matter of finding it. Yet, is
there really anything good on the
radio? It’s a question worth inves-
tigating.

As for morning talk shows,
John Boy and Billy and Bob and
Sherri drive me absolutely insane.
All four have a sinister plot to blast
my clock-radio, even if I set it on
the Jazz Channel. Who hired these
mutant people to tell annoying
jokes and make prank calls two
hours a day, five days aweek?

95.1 the Edge is a whole dif-
ferent beast. The DJs for the Edge

have the best job ever because all

they dois put ona 12 song tape and
leave for the whole day. They
throw in a couple of ticket give-
aways every few hours to give the

impression that actual live people
are in the studio but it’s definitely
all a farce. Your cheap charade is
not fooling us, Edge people!

The resident 95.1 experts on
campus, the weight room*work-
study students, are witnesses to the
redundancy of the Edge’s music.
One weight room work-study,
Chris Hess, works from one until
three. He remarks that the Edge
“plays the same songs over and
over from one to three every day.”

Another weight room fre-
quenter, wrestler Seth Herman, has
the following comments about the
Edge: “it plays the same three songs
13 times a day for three months,”
“it is cheesy as all get out,” and
“the announcers suck.” Further-
more, he laments, “‘it’s too slow to
lift to.”

The consensus is clear: The
gig is up! Charlotte radio needs to
shape up. No more talk blabber or

and John Boy out of my car!

needed fallout
inenrollment, freeing the ability of
first year students’ course choice
in finding their major and minor.
Of course, departments experienc-
ing crowded colloquiums, semi-
nars, and lab space would not have
to offer a minor since doing so
would not be to the faculty’s or
students’ advantage.

The voluntary institution of
minors should be looked at more in
depth. The faculty should find out
which of their departments want to
institute minors and gauge student
interest regarding minoring in those
perspective departments.

Now a challenge faces us all.

ment in higher

As students, we of the classes ‘96-
99 can change the Davidson ex-
perience for what,we believe will
be the better. We attend college
here during one of the most chang-
ing and important periods of its
history. It would be a shame to let
apathy and misinformation over-
come our effort to make the col-
lege a better place for future stu-
dents,

All of us who believe strongly
in minors should talk with profes-
sors, SGA representatives, and
each other via e-mail, office hours,
and campus forums. There are
many dedicated students trying to
institute minors. The rest of the
student body should join them.
Even those students well into their

- Major or content with their con-

centration should throw in their
support. Believe or not, I have no
intentions of pursuing a minor.
With a cohesive effort, student
pleas can be effectively heard.
Finally, I encourage all play-
ers in this decision to approach it
with an open mind. My opinion on
minors can easily change once I
learn more about them. Students
should not see the faculty as
misperceiving student interests
with private agendas and beliefs.
Faculty should not see students as
a group set out to further verify

“academic efforts.

Change must come from both
sides and preferably the sooner the
better. If anything, a campus wide
dialogue should come from this. I
hope an opponent to minors will
write in defending their stance. I
hope this article will lead into class-
room discussion about the subject.

The faculty should take another
‘serious look at the new proposal

and hopefully endorse it. But, not
before we all talk about it.
