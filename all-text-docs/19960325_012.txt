The — in Angels

Kushner talks to a small crowd about his play

By Tuomas DANIEL
Guest Writer

During the past week, controversy about

the play Angels in America has dominated —

the headlines. The play, highly acclaimed in
the past couple of decades, is about homo-
sexuality and living with AIDS in America.
The Charlotte production of the drama has
-been marred by protest by Christian funda-
mentalist leaders.

The protest centers around a brief nude

scene by one of the gay male characters |

while he is undergoing an AIDS medical
examination in a doctors office.

Angels playwright Tony Kushner camé
to Charlotte and held an informal question
and answer session, attended by both media
and the general public. The session, which
took place in the Booth Theater, where the
play is currently showing, lasted for almost
two hours, with Kushner answering the
audience’ s various questions on a wide range

of issues. His quick wit and candid remarks
created an amicable atmosphere while his
remarkable intelligence left the spectators
in awe.

The members of the public asked gen-
eral questions about his life and experiences
in the theater; they were obviously there to
learn about this heralded writer and gain
insight into his thoughts. He talked about
growing up in Louisiana and the manner in
which the South has influenced both his
work and his outlook on the world.

Also emphasized was the synthesis-he
has found between his Jewish faith, his

homosexuality, and his liberal political in- |

terests. In a unique way, he has taken these
three separate entities and brought them
together as the foundation for his beliefs.
Also included in his remarks were a list of
other playwrites, including Shakespeare and
Brecht, who have greatly influenced him.

The media, however, were much more
interested in the controversy which has been
caused by the Charlotte production. Kushner
was very frank in his views on the issue. He
declared the nudity in the play, which the
fundamentalists claim is pornography, is
only a fabricated excuse for their true con-
cerns. “The controversy is not about nudity,
it is about homophobia,” said Kushner. He
contended that the leader of the fundamen-
talists, Joe Chambers, is a “bigot,” nothing
more than a “major league whako.”

Using the Bill of Rights as a starting
place, Kushner gave a thorough explanation
of the fact that any person attempting to
limit expression of any form does not be-
lieve in freedom and democratic principles.

When asked why the nude scene, which
lasts for only eight seconds could not be
removed for this production, Kushner re-
plied that doing so would alter the play as a
whole. Wanting to create an impression of
the audience, he was adament that the hu-
miliation of receiving AIDS treatment in a
strange office by strange people was neces-
sary. To illustrate the patient being stripped
of his dignity, it was required that he be
stripped of clothing as well, and this is why
the eight seconds of nudity could not and
should not be removed.

Kushner reminded the audience that the
controversy is about much more than nu-
dity, it is about a sickness which pervades
societyand that which we must all stand up
and fight with the same unfailing courage
that he has demonstrated.
