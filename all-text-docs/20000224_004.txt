These last few months have been marked
by an increasingly protectionist attitude by
the United States. Last week was detrimental
to US foreign relations as it ruffled the feath-
ers of both Brazil and the European Union
(EU) through its decision to increase the tax
on imported steel. Additionally, the US has
been pressuring the EU to import from US-
owned Latin American banana plantations.
' This form of protectionism was also seen in
the unsuccessful World Trade Organization
(WTO) meeting last year in Seattle.

There are several reasons for this re-
newed protectionism. One of them is the fact
that we are in an election year. It doesn’t look
good for the Democratic president nor a:‘ma-
jority Republican House and Senate to be
allowing foreign goods to crowd the domes-
tic market. This hurts American industries,
which are composed of voters.

Another reason is that American indus-
tries, in general, are fearful of third world
competition. They know they cannot com-
pete with their cheap and unending labor.
That is why President Clinton did not want to
talk about trade before discussing labor is-
sues in the Seattle meeting. Another danger is
that multi-national firms will simply move to
those countries, taking with them not only the
American market, but also American jobs.
With China entering the WTO, these issues
become a pressing reality.

Let’s face it. This nation presently en-
joys its largest economic expansion ever. It
also boasts one of its lowest unemployment
rates. According to economists, this trend
does not show any sign of ending. Instead,
Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board, is increasing interest rates in
order to contain consumption and avoid over-
heating the economy.

Then why all this fear of foreign en-
trenchment?

One must consider that the US does have
a deficit in its trade balance. Moreover, most
of the jobs that are being-created are not
fulfilling the needs of those that are losing
jobs. These new jobs are mostly for highly

skilled labor, while the demand for low-
skilled labor is decreasing. Yet, what about
the “miraculous and invisible hand” of capi-
talism? Shouldn’t the whole country benefit
from growth even if this connection cannot
initially be made?

Is it wrong for a country to prefer and
give privileges to its own industries? Accord-
ing to common sense, no. But according to
globalization, yes! That is where the problem
lies. The United States has waved the banner
of globalization as an important component
of its foreign policy as exhibited by its admit-
tance of China into the WTO.

A few years ago, the Colossus of the
North waged trade wars with European coun-
tries and Japan over agricultural products and
luxury cars. For example, in the Chablistrade
war, France did not want to import geneti-
cally altered agriculture yet, in those instances
the US, claimed that these countries were
going against the principles of free trade.

Therefore, the problem is not American
protectionism but its dubious double stan-
dard concerning foreign policy. On one hand,
the government presents itself as the de-
fender of the free market and, consequently,
free trade. On the other hand, whenever faced
by domestic pressure, it becomes truly pro-
tectionist.

The truth is that no country can really
defend free trade completely. Every country
will support free trade as long as it benefits its
citizens. This especially holds true for de-
mocracies in election periods.

I would like to present one possible alter-
native to the problem of the rapidly changing
world economy. Globilization seems irre-
versible at this point no matter how much
certain countries would like to stop it. With
the growth of telecommunications such as
‘the Internet, the world moves closer to be-
coming one economy. Governments should
try and use this trend to their advantage rather
than working: against it. Thus, they should
invest in education and make sure opportuni-
ties reach the less. privileged.

States must ensure that the same people
who lose their jobs because of the transitions
in the industries are able. to fulfill the new
