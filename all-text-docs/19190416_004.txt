Alumni and friends of Mr. Daniel S.
Burwell, ‘65, deeply sympathize with
him in the recent death of his wife, which
occurred at Norfolk, Va. No particu-
lars were given but it is thought that
her death must have been sudden as
nothing had been heard of her illness.
Mrs. Burwell, before her marriage, was
Miss Luta Cook, and belonged to one
of the oldest families of Norfolk. She
was prominent in all phases of social
life, and literary effort.

Mr. Burwell was formerly of Char-
lotte, but left there when quite a young
man, marrying and residing in Norfolk.

DEATH OF ALUMNUS.

Those of the students who were at all
acquainted with him were greatly sad-
dened by the death of Rev. Dr. C. C.
Munroe on Friday morning. April 11.
He had been declining in health for a
long while, having given up active work
several years ago. Last year he was a
rather familiar figure as he walked about
on the campus and quite a number of
the fellows learned to know and love
him. But this year he has been slowly
weakening and at the time of his death,
which came sooner than was expected,
he was confined to his bed continually.
The entire student body extends their
sympathy to the bereaved family.

Colin Alexander Munroe was born in
Fayetteville in 1844. He entered Da-
vidson College in ’69 and graduated with
distinction in the class of '72. After
teaching for a year in Mississippi he en-

tered Union ‘Theological Seminary and The HOOVER & SMITH COMPANY

graduated there in ‘76. In his earlier
ministry he occupied pasterates in Crys-
tal Springs, Miss., Old Fort, N. C., and
Huntington, W. Va. He was pastor at
Hickory, N. C., for quite a while an

later spent 20 years at Lenoir, N. C
When he resigned there he took charge
of home missions in Concord Presbytery
and was a great force in its propagation
He was always working, and never in

this whole ministry. took a real vacation.

That accounts for his feebleness and rap-
id decline in the last few years. Faith-
fulness was a key note in his entire
life’s work.

Dr. Munroe was the oldest son in a
large family, in which three brothers
were ordained as ministers at the same
time, he being one of them. Dr. J. P.
Munroe, formerly Davidson's beloved
physician, now of Charlotte, is his young-
est brother. .

He is survived by his wife, who was
a Miss Stokes, of Prince Edward Coun-
ty, Va., and is now residing at David-
son, and four children: Mrs. J. M.
Douglas, of Davidson, Dr. H. S. Mun-
roe, of Columbus, Ga.; Mrs. W. T.
Hudson, of Greenville, S. C.; and Miss
Mary Munroe, of Davidson. His
brother, Rev. Dugald Munroe, of ‘72.
was present also at the funeral Saturday
afternoon, -

Among the beautiful floral tributes to
the beloved memory of Dr. Munroe was
one given by the faculty of the college
as a mark not simply of personal esteem
for him, but also in recognition of his
faithful service for years as a trustee of
Davidson. Others pwere sent by the
church in Lenoir and devoted friends in
Hickory. A beautiful and touching ser-
vice was conducted in the church by
Revs. Dr, Richards, W. ‘I’. Walker, E.
D. Brown and S. H. Hay. The de-
ceased was interred in the cemetery at
Davidson.

Among those present at the service
were Mr. and Mrs. John Bernhardt,
Mrs. G. L. Bernhardt, George Harper
and his son, Capt. James Harper, ‘15.
Mr. and Mrs. Beall, and Mr, and Mrs.
Simeon Smith, all from Lenoir. From
Hickory were Mr. and Mrs. K. C, Men-
zies, Mrs. E:, B. Menzies, Mrs. T. F.
Stevenson, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and
Misses Amelia and Lizzie McComb.
Among those from Charlotte were Drs.
A. J. Crowell and Matheson.
