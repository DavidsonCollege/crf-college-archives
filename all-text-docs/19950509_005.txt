They’re All Phony

We were lucky, if you can call it luck. A couple of us got jobs for next
year. A couple of us are going abroad. A few of us have another year at
Davidson. A few wish we still did. One of us feels like have we wasted a
couple of years in rural North Carolina. Three of us have.

So why call ourselves lucky? Well, we didn’t have to do our laundry for
a few years, and the freshman SAT has gone up since we got in. If we’d been
alittle younger, we might be reading Waller novels on top of a Maytag right
now. When we were freshmen— man, there were some throw downs that
year. Things were different then, believe it. We got away with murder.

As graduation approaches, you might hear it said that the class of “95 had
a few problems other classes haven’t had. We’ve dropped, dropped out,
dropped the ball, screwed around, broken stuff, peed everywhere, disre-
spected our elders, crapped on ourselves, almost woken up dead a few times.
It’s been great. Some of us even have another year of all this.

So here we are, editorializing, reminiscing, wondering who we saw
today who we will never ever see again. We are English majors, most of us.
We are often full of lies and slander. Instead of trying to impart one last
opinion on you, we’ ve decided to give Davidson a new alma mater.

Imagine us gathered around a big stone building. Allis quiet. It is dark,
and we are holding candles in a circle, hand in hand. Suddenly, a song rises
into the air. A student walking home from the library hears a melody wafting
across the lawn, and turns to walk a little closer to us. One of us moons her,
giggling. Then we begin:

O Davidson!

We're tired of this place. You still go here— you make up the rest.

p.s.— Thanks for bitching all the time and never saying anything good about
the paper. You’ve been helpful.

LETTERS

The horrors of verbosity

To the editors,

I would like to write to
the editors of The Davidso-
nian to express my over-
whelming concern over the
horrendous problem of ex-
cessive wordiness in the
work of today’s Davidso-
nian writers of Opinions ar-
ticles. Every time I begin to
pick up my copy of “The
South’s Foremost College
Weekly” I start to dread the
inevitable overflow of su-
perfluous words, clauses,

phrases, etc, that serve only
to add’ to my reading dis-
pleasure and to cause an an-
noying and irritating degree
of waste of my most valu-
able time. If Davidsonian

writers who submit their ar- .

ticles of opinion to the paper

__ would simply. attempt.to.try.

to trim down their prose just
a little bit, all of the students
such as myself who are suf-
fering under a pressure that
is imposed by our strenuous
academic schedules would

certainly bea great deal more
grateful and thankful. If ev-
eryone would try to think a
little bit about all of those
unnecessary, excessive,
needless, expendable, un-
called for, non-essential and
unwarranted words, then all
_ofsthe.articles in The David-

sonian Opinions séction
would be a whole lot less
long and much more easy
for people to read.

Sincerely,

Gustave Flaubert ‘95

More Evolution, please

To the editors,

When I picked up the
last edition of The Davidso-
nian I distressed at the lack
of another Evolution article.
I, along with the. dozens of
other aspiring assistant li-
brarians on campus, found
the ongoing Evolution de-
bate both intriguing and ex-

and I would spend hourseach
week arguing the Evolution
question over hot cocoa and
animal crackers while wait-
ing for the PhiGamm Tram.
We never did make it to any
parties, though, and I’m be-
ginning to suspect that “The

hilarating. My two friends-

Tram” doesn’t depart from
in front of E.H. Little Li-
brary like those frat guys
told us.‘ However, that is
beside the point.

The Davidsonian has
robbed us of a intellectual
fiesta and a wonderfully re-
warding bonding experi-
ence. Those of you who
frequent the Computer Cen-
ter may already know me,
and you know that my social
skills are a little underdevel-
oped. The Evolution articles
gave me the opportunity to
branch out and discuss an
issue of vital importance to
today’s society with my in-

tellectual comrades. Now
that the articles are over lam
sad to say that my life will
return to my old pastimes of
Dungeon & Dragons and
putting bugs in the computer
system. After I tasted the
excitement of the Evolution
debate, what used to thrill
me so much carries so little
appeal. When I graduate
two years early and open my
own software outlet and li-.
brary supplies depot, you
cruel editors of The David-
sonian will pay for your in-
sensitivity.

Sincerely,

Lewis Scholenick, ‘98
