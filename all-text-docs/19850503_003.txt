John Marks Wins Vereen Bell Writing Award

By LEE WHITE

Senior John Marks is this
year’s winner of the Vereen Bell
Memorial Award. This award is
presented each year at Spring
Convocation for the best piece of
creative writing by a Davidson up-
perclassman. Marks won_ the

- award for three short stories, ‘““The
Stanza of Fenris Callibeauf,” “A
Fierce Bad Day,” and “Dust
Country”.

Marks said about his work,
“There is a sense of the unreal, the
macabre.” He noted that isolation,
fragmentation, and disorientation
are also themes in his writing.

His short story “A Fierce Bad
Day” put Marks in the final com-
petition for the fiction prize this
winter at the Hollins Literary Fes-
tival. Other than this contest,
Marks has not submitted his writ-
ings to contests or publications
other than Hobart Park and The
Miscellany. “| never got to the
point [where] | felt it was strong
enough,” he said.

It was JYA in Marburg, ac-
cording to Marks, which really
“opened up the floodgates” for his
writing. The environment, he
said, “freed the imagination to

move here and there, to specu-
late.” Marburg was a place where
there were students from all over
the world; where history, from the
cathedrals to the philosophy of
Nietzsche, was at his fingertips,
he added.

Marks said that there are prob-
lems in writing at Davidson. He
felt there is little encouragement
for purely creative writing. “It’s
almost something you have to
sneak after midnight, — like
junkfood.” Davidson's atmos-
phere does not encourage creativ-
ity, according to Marks. He said
that he felt the emphasis on being
well-rounded is fine, to a point,
but people should also be able to
focus their creative energies.

Marks has excelled at David-
son in both creative writing and
acting. At Spring Convocation he
also received a Theatre Depart-
ment award for his contributions
to theatre at Davidson. Asked to
comment on the similarities be-
tween the two,-he said that in both
of them, “I am hiding in my own

or someone else's words, trying to”

generate life beyond them.”

Next year Marks plans to go to
India to work with a rural develop-
ment organization. “I want to put

a halt to things; figure out what |
want to do,” he said. He will not
have much chance to pursue his
creative writing, he said. How-
ever, he expects the experience
will prove valuable to his writing.
He thinks that the chance to ex-
perience in India a_ living
mythological religion and to work
where there is suffering will be
particularly important.

Marks said that he has written
since third grade. His first interest
was fantasy literature, especially
Tolkein’s Lord of the Rings tril-
ogy. Writers whose work has been
especially attractive to Marks are
Sam Shepard, Thomas Hardy,
and Gabriel Garcid Marquez. He
said that he especially admired
Marquez’s ability to take some-
thing or somebody that could con-
ceivably exist on our planet and
“submerge them into a magical
universe.” He also said that he
sees in Shepard a sense of the
West, the contradiction of being
trapped while in huge open
spaces.

ATC Proposal

(continued from page !)
this year’s $5,500 SGA budget.

Miano said $250 of this reduction cor-
responds to the planned increase in funding
from the Admissions Office of the co-spon-
sored SGA/Admissions Office Admissions
Weekend for prospective students.

Included in the ATC budget for the first
time since 1981-82, the Residence Hall
Council (RHC) received $500. The RHC,
described by Miano as ‘a lobbying group to
present student concerns to the Housing Of-
fice,” consists of dorm senators.

Club Sports received a $1,600 budget
increase from its 1984-85 figure of $6,000,
making its 1985-86 allotment $7,600.

Miano justified the increase as paralleling a
30 percent increase in student participation
in non-varsity sports.

“I'ma little disappointed that a student-
funding organization is not supporting a to-
tally student service, specifically designed
for helping students, any more than it is,”
said RAPE Committee head Melissa McLe-
more. McLemore’s organization requested
$3,287 and received $230.

“The money the service did receive will
be very helpful in starting some new student
serices for next year,” McLemore added.
She cited a telephone hot-line and the estab-
lishment of educational services and a
Rape/Crisis Center.

The number of campus thefts last month
is more than the total for the year, according

people come in, it’s the same way during

locker and returned to find the lock re-
