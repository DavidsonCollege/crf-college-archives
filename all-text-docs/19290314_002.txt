The

Davidsonian
Wants
—to congratulate the student
body’s new officers and the stu-

dent body.

—everybody to continue to cast
a vote throughout the remain-
ing elections.

—to congratulate the newly elec-
ted members of Phi Beta Kap-

WHOSE ANNUAL?

What seems to be a conspicu-
ous inconsistency in student elec-
tions here is the manner of selec-
tion of the Quips and Cranks edi-
tor-in-chief. While the editor of
The Davidsonian and The Cham-
eleon are shosen by general stu-
dent voting; the annual editor has
customarily been elected by the
rising Senior Class.

Any objection to change in this
procedure would probably be on
the grounds that the book is a
product of that class. But is this
a fact? When every student, re-
gardless of class, is taxed equally,
and when the staff is selected par-
tially from the lower classes, and
when no more responsibility is
assumed by the Seniors than by
any other class, it is no more a
privilege of that class to elect
their editor than it is the student
body’s.

There would be this advantage
froma general election. The edi-
tor-se-ehosen would then be the
choice of a greater group and
hence would be responsible to a
larger number; and the under-
classmen would be able to express
their interest in a production just
as truly theirs as the Senior’s.

Regarding the business mana-
ger, the suggestion is offered that
he be chosen just as the managers
of other publications are, i. e., by
the Publications Board upon
recommendation of thé retiring
business manager, and thus, have
the man elected by the group to
which he is later responsible in
either instance.

The® publication of this book
was evidently in the hands of the
Senior Class in former years, but
circumstances quite different
have. altered: the situation, mak-
ing the editorship a student body
honor rather than a class distinc-
tion.

Why not have the 1930 editor
elected by the student body? — It’s
the student body’s annual.

EDUCATING FOR PEACE

Upon nothing does world peace
depend so much as on the obliter-
ation of ignorance among man-
kind by a lasting and thorough
system of education. Ignorance,
misunderstanding, prejudice, nar-
row-mindedness and sensuality
have been, and will continue to be,
the cause of human suffering and
unhappiness in alts lands.

The dark veil hanging low over
the heads of the people, obstruct-
ing the light of knowledge must
be swept aside before values may
be properly guaged and before
sincere relations may be effected.
This training must be given the
youth of the day in the higher in-
stitutions of learning, inspiring a
nobler idealism, free from selfish
interests, and idealism which is
world-wide in scope of considera-
tion, Until this results, people
will continue to blunder in the
darkness of misconception and er-
ror; ‘war will follow war; and
man, in his unfortunate lack of
knowledge, will make friction
with his fellow. No League or in-
ternational body imposed upon a
recalcitrant and ignorant people
will be of notable importance.

There are psychologists who
contend that man has his instincts
which cannot be altered. Man,
they say, is inherently pugna-
cious, and no amount of enlight-
enment will drive this faculty
from its stronghold. This, how-
ever, cannot be held in its en-
tirety, for there are instincts
which are constantly denied by
action prompted largely through
ideals arising from the education
to which the individual has been
subjected.

The mistakes and pitfalls in the
thoughts and actions of the pre-
ceding generations may be seen
when man is guided into the
world of the past through the
book of the historian; looking
through the keen eye of
science, his mind may dwell 6n the
marvels of the universe; and be-
ing lifted from the misty marsh
lands to the breezes of the hill-
top, the narrow bounds of nation-
alism, of class, of color, and of
creed will disappear into thin air.

A SACRIFICE TO PROGRESS

When
Chambers

the columns of Old

were destroyed last
week, there passed from the scene
of man one of the landmarks of
the old time. The four columns
had, stood for more than seventy
years, a monument to the lives
and work of the founders of Da-
vidson College. Now they are
gone; destroyed because they
marred the beauty of the New
Chambers building. Such is the
edict of progress. Everything
that is in the way of the new must
go, lest it detract from the use-
fulness and attractiveness of the
modern,

Such a spirit, it seems, is
wrong. There is no recall of
what has gone, but. there is a
chance to save the other monu-
ments of the past. Some of the
old buildings on the campus mean
more to the lovers of the college
than any new building that could

be built. The spirit of progress

Current Comment
By John Brown

The posibility of a renewed Civil War
seems iminent in China. A short while
ago China was faced with the problem
of absorbing 2,500,000 soldiers into civil-
ian life. The problem now is to keep the
different factions from flying at each
others throats.

One development foreseen for the fu-
ture of aircraft is the air train. Such a
train would consist of a powerful leading
plane which would pull a series of gliders
in its path, One important advantage
of this would be that a fast non-stop train
could drop a glider load of passengers
at each city without having to land and
then rise again.

It seems that air travel is becoming saf-
er at any rate. Last year the number of
pilots licensed increased by 92 per cent.
during the last six months, while the
number of accidents increased by only
70 per cent, and deaths resulting there-
from showed an increase of 40 per cent.
Of the 368 deaths from airplanes in 1928
only a small percentage occurred in estab-
lished airplane lines, while over half the
deaths happened during irregular pleasure
trips.

United States beet and cane-sugar pro-
ducers are petitioning Congress to raise
the tariff on sugar from 1:76 to 3 cents
per pound. Such an increase, however,
would be ruinous to the Cuban sugar in-
dustry and would work a hardship on
the United States because of increased
prices. This increase would practically
cut off Cuba's supply which annually
amounts to five million tons and which
mostly comes to the United States, Such
a tariff, if passed, would simply amount
to paying a group of home producers ex-
cessive prices for what they can’t produce
as well as somebody else. Such a high
protective tariff, therefore, should be
strongly opposed because it would be un-
just to the foreign producer and to the
home consumer, because it would help
only a small group of home producers,
and because it: would be thoroughly bad
economics for the United States,

Now that the columns of Old Chambers
have crashed to earth without revealing
any traces of a skeleton, etc., who will
originate a ne wlegend for us to talk
about ?

It seems that it is not yet too late for
the acquisition of new territories, Com-
mander Byrd recently reported by wire-
less that he has discovered a vast new
area in Antarctica and has claimed it for
the United States.

game of poker someone displayed three

it would require a Senate investigation.

could be better satisfied with the
erection of needed buildings ra-
ther than by the destruction of
old relics.

Itistead of tearing down, why
not build up. Erect a new dor-
mitory to take the place of the
barracks. One is needed. Why
not build a new and better gym-
nasium, to take the place of
Alumni gymnasium? Let the old
gym be used by the freshmen and
a new one be built for the varsity
—one that is modern in every re-
spect, with suitable places for all
the indoor sports. A swimming
pool is needed. A new and more
modern infirmary could very well
be used.

In the place of destruction, let
the the old and the new stand
side by side, so that the old can
lend dignity to the new’ and
through itself give tradition to
modernism. Everything new is
good, but when age is mingled
with youth, youth is made more
cognizant of its shortcomings and
takes on some of the respect and
worthiness of the old. Sentiment
asks for the retention of the old
and progress and materialism de-
mands the destruction. Which
will win? Will the old buildings
here remain serene in old age un-
til they are a menace to our safe-
ty, or will they be offered up as a
sacrifice to progress?

Collegiate Quips

According to the Fordham “Ram”, it’s
“No Kissing” Campaign during the late,
and much lamented, flu epidemic saved
at least half the school from the disease.
Strange kind of students they have up
there, or they must have some of the
Republican campaign managers keeping
training camp up there.

Wake Forest, and State colleges have
also arrived among the honored. Both
schools recently received letters address-
ed to “The Cutest Man In College.” The
Wake Forest boys called a student body
meeting to decide who was the rightful
owner of said letter, but the one to State
college was delivered by mistake to one
of the students. The letters contained
a request for college stickers by a girl
who was being initiated. This may ex-
plain the letter which came to Davidson
the first part of this school year.

Among the first of the colleges to hold
their elections is Elon. They have already
elected their new editor. Up at Elon
they have a custom of selecting a sponsor
for the paper and printing her picture
in the paper at the start of the new
regime. This seems to be a good idea,
the only trouble is that sometimes the
sponsors are only sponsors and not a thing
of pulchritude as they should be.

Here is a poem that appeared in a re-
cent issue of the Tattler, of R. M. W. C.
INTIMACY

A laugh—a love—a book,
An wundissembling look
A homely task that took
Us both, combined, to do.

A well-known mood—an arm o».
Becomes my shield from harm

A kiss—a mute alarm

Expressed in words so few.

A fumbling hand that aids—
A door we closed, some shades
Are drawn as daytime fades,
And shuts in just us two.

Gettyburg College :—Co-eds up there
are clean. (Here is something that we
found. It looks like it ought to fill
quite. a bit of space. We are not the
regular columnists but in lieu of some-
thing better to do, here is some bull). To
get back to the subject, we meant that
the co-eds are cleaning up. Witness:

Charges of fraud against Gettysburg’s
Postamaster seemed forthcoming for a
short time Monday afternoon when a Fed-
eral department inspector, along with
about tweny-five other spectators, found
five Gettysburg co-eds cleaning the steps
of the local postoffice with tooth-brushes,

The inspector, after an investigation,
found that the young ladies were not he-
ing paid for the work and preferred to
drop the charges. He found that the
girls were pledges of Beta Lambda so-
rority and were merely being “put through
their paces” prior too initation, The co-
eds with his permission, continued with
the work and did not cease until the en-
tire front portico had been made as spot-
less as possible, with the postmaster and
one of the town's political bosses super-
intending the job.

Upon completion of that task, the pave-
ments of Baltimore street were made
sanitary and safe for the inhabitants by
having the cracks in the concrete scrub-
bed, also with toothbrushes. In doing
this job the five co-eds kept perfect step
for the entire block.

This starts out dignified as a review
of the college world, but various factors
led us to change it.

THE BULL PEN |

The trustees meet and decide to have the columns of Old Chambers removed.
The wrecking crew hooks a cable around the beloved structures, the steam thi
puffs, and down come the traditions, scattering home-made( or was it hand-made?)
bricks about. Bricks like mother used to cook, don'tcha know. Crowds of students
and faculty stood about watching the work and waiting patiently for the toppling
of the columns, Everyone was expecting anything from a horse and buggy to
the kitchen stove to be found stored in the hollow portions of these 80-year-old
structures. They found nothing more than what can be found within the limits
of this well-named Bull Pen hot air! When the wreckage told the truth
about the stories of skeletons, tobacco, and whiskey of ye olden days stored away
in the hollow depths of “these ancient columns, so rich in tradition”, immediately
some of the ancients began to remember when the hidden booty was removed. One
of the “gentlemen of color’’ about the college claims that he had himself lowered
into the columns and removed a bunch of traditions. But then this same bit of
local color vows on a stack of dictionaries that he will be next President of David-
son and will install pre-war bars in the basements of all dormitories. We believe
that he will continue his job of making beds and sweeping roms. Still one must
credit the Negro race with very vivid imaginative qualities. Bars in the basements
of Davidson College dormitories !

ASSORTED SHORTS

When a fellows in love, everything lodks entirely different to him. But then,
it’s the same way when he hits his head on a cement pavement.

The fresmen have been given the privilege of going around minus their “red-
tops.” We can remember way back there when we “took our caps off.” The
first few days, when we walked out minus the Krosh cap, we felt we had left
something. After being sure we had our pants on, had not forgotten our shirt and
were wearing shoes, it would finally dawn on us that the cap was the missing
article.

Just about the time when the freshman thinks he is really progressing in this
thing called college, Soph Day pops up. It won’t belong now! Two more days

practice and we could have ridden our stick horse better than Cal Coolidge can
ride his hobby-horse.
