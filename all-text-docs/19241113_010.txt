the attitude towards life in the city of
Rome.”

Mr. Dendy continued his talk to show how
Christ’s ministry and life may influence our
lives. There are three salient effects it has
or may have. One of these is the restora-
tion of man through the atonement of Christ
|to his former likeness of God. Once we}
were lost but are now sanctified and have the |
power to know Him.

“Christ-can and does replace sin by the
| healing power of His loveliness,” stated the
speaker. “The Kingdom in which we are
joint heirs with Christ has no boundaries. |
| ‘Earth with her thousand voices praises God.’ |
| How much the more should we praise Him.

“He raises us trom pauperism to princeli-
ness. Too many of God's children are slug-
| gish and lazy because they have not been
roused to realize they can talk with a King.

“There are American women too who are
pouring tea when they might be saving
oriental girls; American men who throw
away their talents in easy living who might
be leaders in the upbuilding of nations and
provinces.

“Christ showed us the value and dignity
of the human soul. Everyone has, a mission
in life. There is some way in which you
may glorify God. ‘

“Can you,” he asked in conclusion, “look
into the face of Christ, get His smile of ap-
proval, and then go out and witness for
Him?”

As a special musical feature the K. K. K.
of the Glee Club gave one selection, “Drift-
ing.” Monk and Moffett offered short pray-
ers during the opening exercises and Bryant
led the union singing. |

ORIGINAL ONE-ACT PLAYS

(Continued from page 1)
Williams (J. H. Hall), gets religion at a
camp meeting and the way in which they are
reconciled is the story. The additional char-
acters are Bud Bowman (B. U. Ratchford),
Harris (W. I. Howell), and Thorpe (R. B.
‘Parker). The scene is laid in a mountain
cabin in Avery County, North Carolina.

The last play to be presented is Blue Blood.
The scene is in a newspaper office in Ellis-
ton, Miss., where the plot, based on sec-
tional prejudice, is worked out. Paul Court-
ney (A. M. Martin) falls in love with Mil-
dred Buford (Katherine Matthews), who has
dropped into town from the North. Paul’s
Aunt, Helen Courteney (Nina Holt White),
is a very aristocratic old lady and opposes
the match. The other two parts, those of
Andy and Buck Saunders, are played by the
author, C, F. Smith, and L. L. Deck.

“FIRE” GALORE WILL BE ON
THE HILL SATURDAY

If next Saturday afternoon comes half
way up to expectations, the load of
“fire” on the campus will make Junior
| Speaking and Commencement weeks

look like the south side of a desert island
{on the Fourth of July.

There will be frocks and rumors of
| frocks. They will be all over the cam-
| pus, thicker than Fresh caps, each one
| swinging ontosome poor bird whois
| worried to death from wondering how
|long he will have to do without a coffin
/tack in order that he may pay up all
| debts caused by said bit of humanity’s
| visit to the Wildcats’ lair.

Each fair damsel will have both the
[Boner and the privilege of having the
|time honored “fire,” yelled and re-xelled
|at her as she walks to and fro over the
|campus. If it is the first time that she
| has heard the greeting, it will make her
blush and become self-conscious, but if
she has been a visitor here before she
will pass by, ignoring the wild yells of
the irresponsible bird who is sad because
his girl was unable to be up for the big
time, and who delights in bumfuzzling
the bird. wha js bis fellow sufferer at all
times other than Homecoming Day.

Dr. Hugh White, of China,-father of
Henry Martin White, ’24, was on the
Hill! last week.
