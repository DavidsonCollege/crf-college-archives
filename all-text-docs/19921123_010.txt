parallels between the Big South
and the Southern. Our last game
against a Southern, Conference
opponent was Appalachian State
two years ago, and we defeated
them. UNC-Asheville played a
Southern Conference opponent, I
think three of them last year, four
of them the year before, and were
very competitive with them.
Campbell was very competitive
with Southern Conference foes.So

there’s some degree of compari-

son between the Southern and the
Big South. But, there’s no doubt
that the Southern has more quality
players on their rosters than what a
Big South team has, generally, on
their roster. So to be picked ninth
or tenth is understandable, it’s ac-
ceptable from the standpoint of we
welcome that role of underdog.
We are going to try to prove the
experts are'wrong. So we’re not
offended by it, we understand why.
The power ratings have the South-
ern at the 20th spot, they have the
Big South as the 28th-ranked con-
ference. And of course the teams
like East Tennessee State and UT-
Chattanooga and Marshall and
Georgia Southern have tradition-
ally been more powerful than Big
South teams.

D: Because you recruited almost
every member of the team, this
year is the first year that you
could call the team basically your
own. Do you feel a little more

pressure, are you putting more.

pressure on yourself, this year?
Do you expect a little bit more
this year?

M: Ihave had more fun since March
as a basketball coach at Davidson
than!’ vehad in my first three years
here. Ihavecometolearn the honor
of being at Davidson and I really
mean that. It’s an honor to be here,
whether-you’reacoach ora faculty
member or administrator or staff
member or student. There’s some-
thing to be said of the people who

* are in this college community that

sets us apart from many of the
other universities and colleges
throughout the country. We have
dared to be differnt by coming
here, and ‘it is a different place, and
Ihave learned whatan honor itis to
be here. And it’s taken three years
of experience to get to that point.
And I think our students some-
times go through that process as
well. You just look at the way the
- alums feel about this place after
they’ ve left, there’s a certain love
affair that carries far into their 30’s
and 40’s and 50’s and 60’s and
beyond, that Davidson is kind of a
special and unique place. So with
this concept of feeling it an honor

to be here, with this feeling of
having fun and enjoying it here,
I’ve cast aside any sense of pres-
sure upon myself personally, even
though this is the fourth year of the
rebuilding process, and feel that
the fun I’m having is going to filter
down to our players. And perhaps
that’s going to take some of the
pressure off them. Not perhaps, it
will. There’s no doubt in my mind.
We’re going to have fun this year
playing basketball for Davidson,
we're going to try to play a fun
style. We’re going to try to be
characterized by, as I said, the two
points being aggression and intel-
ligence. Youknow, we’re supposed
to be an outstanding academic in-
stitution, but why can’t that be
reflective of our styleofplay. We’re
supposed to be the leaders, the
student body and the graduates,

we’re supposed to be the leaders of.

the community and the world. Why
can’t that intelligence factor then
be used as a real edge on the bas-
ketball court for us? So coming to
understand Davidson, andit’s taken
some time, and I’m sure you stu-
dents understand that better than
us staff members. Coming to un-
derstand Davidson has really put
things into focus for myself and I
am very, very excited about this
new sense of enthusiasm that I feel
about being here.

Matt Grieser
5710" 150 G
Goshen, In.

Greiser averaged 14 points and six assists per game as a senior at
Goshen H.S., and was honored ag All-Area Player of the Year. He has
been unable to practice recently because of a foot injury, but should
return soon. Greiser sees the floor and handles the ball well, and is one
of several candidates for time behind Zimmerman at point guard.
Jeff Anderson
6’°4" 190 G/F
Anderson, In.

Anderson contributed 17 points and eight rebounds a game to his
Frank Cox H.S. team last year, earning mention as Third Team All-
State in the process. He excels at slashing to the basket, and also has”
a good shooting touch. With his performance in the first three weeks

. of practice, Anderson has made a bid for a starting role at off-guard;

likely he will also play at the small forward position.
