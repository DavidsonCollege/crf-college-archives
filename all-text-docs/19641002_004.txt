he YMCA's annual fund
drive will begin Thursday,
Oct. 8. and last until the fol-
lowing Thursday, Oct. 15. |
The goal this year is $4.500
or $4.50 per. student. The Y
budget for 196465 is $4475.

To Make Merry Music

Eric Nichols, fund drive chair-
man, said a careful study of
last year’s expenses was made
before the budget was adopted.

When asked why the budget
called for $25 less than last

year, Nichols had. this to say:

Voluntary Chapel Series
To Depart From The Past

“Varieties in Worship” will
be the theme of six voluntary
chapel programs this semester
which will represent a signi-
ficant departure from weekly
programs of years past.

The changes are largely the
result for work by Bill Rule,
YMCA spiitual life chairman.
Rule feels that the old twice-
a-week, every-week system
added very ‘little to Davidson’s
religious life. They have been
abolished.

“In general we are attempt-
ing a more complete coopera-
tion among the various re-
ligious organizations on cam-
pus with the hope of reducing
confusion and duplications
among thm and presenting the
student with a wider variety of
Teligious activity and experi-

Democratic Conventions

By BOS STRAUSER
Davidsonian Feature Editor

It has been occasionally
rumored and even said
aloud at times that the
Davidson student takes no
active interest in matters
political, Without proving
conclusively that such rum-
ors are ill-founded, the poli-
tical conventions of this past
summer were not without
Davidson representation.

Easily the largest cont.nzent
of participating students used
as a medium the energetic
“Yourg Citizens for Johnson.”

of Senator Burch Byah of

Arnie Snider, Dan Bsone, and

ence from which to choose.”
Rule explained.

Rule hopes that the various
church-affiliated groups here
will alternate in sponsoring
these services.

“We wul consider the pre-
sence of students at these pro-
grams a vote of confidence in
efforts of creativity in an area
which has often been stifling,”
he added.

This week a film, “Worship
in Dance,” was presented, an
attempt to preach a sermon
through the medium of modern
dance.

Wednesday the chapel will
feature ‘Voices in a World of
Revolution," a choral reading
in .the context of a modern
world, with appropriate re.
sponses from the worshipers.

Dick Thurston donned the red,
white and biue vest and straw
hat uniform of the organization
for their week in Atlantic City.

Originally the organization
has been a modest proposal
at best, but the flood of ap-
pication and interest trans-
formed: the proceeding into
almost an overgrown pep raliy.
There were menial tasks as-
S.gned to some: two organiz-
ed rallies, however, were the
high point of the week.

B'll Garrard workd for a day
wah executive director, James
Fitzpatrick, and found time
later in the week to work with
the Georgia delegation. The
Snider twins took greatest in-
terest in the ‘“‘Webb dispute,”
an entertaining sidelight within
the North Caro ina delegation.

Several of the group found
their way onto the f.oor with
the borrowed credentials of
John Spratt, alternate from
South Carolina and former
student body president. D.ck
Thurston fared even better in
his role as guide for members
of the photography corps; h.s
credentia‘s took him over the
convention floor and into the
center of the “sensation-seek-
ing” press contingent.

Even Wil Terry was in. at-
tendance for Jchnson’s week-
:0ng birthday celedration. Wil!

DRIVE BEGINS THURSDAY

YMCA Sets $4,500 Goal

“The fund drive goal for this,
year is the same as for last,
year, since the program: is és-:
sentially the same. The allot- ,

-ment for same items, however

was changed either up or down..
This evaluation resulted in the
slight difference.”

Nichols added, “The achieve-
ments of last. year, especially
in the Great Issues program
and in the quality of speakers
at Y forums should be noted
by students, The continued ef-
fectiveness of these programs
depend on the financial sup.
port of students this year.

“The speakers for next se-
mester have‘ not all been en-
gaged. Any receipts in excess
of the $1,500 goal would mean
more or better speakers in the
spring,” Nichols said.

Students will receive con-
tribution envelopes Oct. 8,
from the solicitor on each
hall. A booklet explaining the
work of the YMCA and describ-
ing the areas of Y activities
will accompany each envelope.
Contributions may be turned in
to the solicitor any time dur-
ing the eight days of the drive.

Nichols expressed the hope
that as many. students as pos-
sible would turn in contribu-
tions “winhin a couple of days.”

Endowment Payments Aid
In Development Program

A $10,000 first payment of
a $5,200,000 endowment gift
from the Z. Smith Reynolds
Foundation has recently been
made to the college.

The Foundation will pay the
remainder of the bequest dur-
ing the next 10 years. The total
will represent the second
largest gift in the school's
history.

In another grant to the col-
lege, the Stella and Charles
Guttman Foundation pledged
$5,000 per year for the next
four years to aid Davidson’s
Financial Assistance program.

Davidson has also received
$2500 from the General Elec-
tric Foundation to strength the
teaching of physics. This grant
is one of 150 totaling $650,000

Tom Craig, meanwhile, en-
joyed full press privileges as
he represented five newspapers
in North and South Carolina.
Having received the Wall Street
Journal scholarship for aspir-
ing journalists, Craig had. been
working for a Spartanburg
paper when he received the
envious assignment.

Completing the trio was Al-
len Webb, who was passing
through San Francisco on his
way to visit in Oregon. With
Craig’s help, Webb got into

proceedings; he was unable,
despite effort, to obtain a job

Commenting on the bequests

cognized the gifts as “encour-

toward raising $20.5 million in
Davidson’s current (1956-1971)

President Martin expressed

needs of the institotion.”
