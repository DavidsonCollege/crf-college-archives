FAMED ‘SATCHMO’
TO PLAY FAVORITES;
TICKETS ON SALE

Louis Armstrong, widely re-
garded as the Jazz King of
America, will bring his cele-
brated all-star band to David-
son Thursday night, May 6,
for a two-hour concert in
Chambers Auditorium, IFC
President Charlie Hassell has
announced.

Tickets to the concert will be
sold to college students and resi-
dents of Davidson for $1.75
through April 15, after which date
the price will be $2.00.

The famous “Satchmo,” who has
been in the business of playing
and singing jazz since he was
fifteen, is the man who popularized
such long-standing favorites as
“Basin ~Street Blues,” “Muskrat
Ramble,” “High Society,” and
“Dippermouth.” His most recent
movie appearance was in “The
Glenn Miller Story” in which he
played himself in a jam session
along with several other popular
bandleaders.

Satehmo’s Start

“Satchmo,” says a recent maga-
zine article on the famous band-
leader, “forged his reputation in
the Chicago of the Twenties, The
city was then a hothouse for a
young, ardent and brilliant group
of youngsters who were to spread
a fondness for their kind of jazz
to all parts of the country.

‘Youngsters like Bix Beider-
becke, Benny Goodman, Gene
Krupa, Eddie Condon listened to
Louis, found him giving expres-
sion to ideas they were groping
for and tried to learn from him.

“In that Chicago ‘Satchmo’ or-
ganized his first band, the kind of
small group which he has always
favored as the happiest medium
for jazz and which he uses on his
world tours today.

“First it was Louis Armstrong’s
Hot Five, then his Hot Seven. He
was induced to change over from
a cornet to a trumpet. One of his
early Chicago employers said that
the larger trumpet would look
more impressive.

“He also began to take his turn
as a singer, and those who heard
him recognized that the affinity
for jazz that had come seething
out of this young chap’s horn was
also in his voice and singing style.”

Davidsoh College. This visit will

The team will be located at the

posed of one air force flying of-
ficer (pilot) and three airmen, who
are specialists on the Air Force's
flying training programs.

The purpose of this visit is to
counsel interested persons on the
pilot and aerial observer phases

grams in the Air Force, and to
assist those who desire to make

Morton Thompson; Gone with the
Windsors, by Iles Brody; Tomor-
row, by Philip Wylie; Peece with
God, by Billy Graham; and The
Ponder Heart, by Eudora Welty.

Not as a Stranger is “a novel
dedicated to pure medicine.” Al-
though the author is not a doctor,
he spent years of research gather-
ing information so as to make the
details authentic in every place.

Gone with the Windsors is an
exeremely frank appraisal of the
Duke and Duchess of Windsor.

Tomorrow is “a story of what

happens in two American cities, &

when-—-someday in the future—
Russia opens a new war with
atomic weapons,”

Peace with God, in the words of
the author, “was written for the
man in the street, to give him a
clear understanding of a new way
of life.”

The Ponder Heart is said to be
“a -happy book” in every detail.
Uncle Daniel Ponder, one of the
main characters, was “good as
gold, rich as Croesus, and gener-
ous as well.”

BUSINESS CONCERNS

Representatives from many out-
standing business concerns visit
the campus each spring to hold

uates. So far this year over
twenty-five companies have held

placement director Elgin White,

what they saw.

The companies, such as Colgate
and Sears-Roebuck, have shown
special interest jn prospects for

sales and personnel representa-

tives, and administration heads.
Some applicants have gone as far
as New York and Cleveland for
their second interviews.

In addition to the companies
mentioned above, representatives
from Portland Cement, Wachovia
Bank, National Carbon, Company,
and several other concerns are ex-
pected during April and May.
