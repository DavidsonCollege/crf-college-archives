Field Hockey takes 4th consecutive Deep South tournament title

By Nancy Hilles

BACK-TO-BACK-TO-
BACK-TO-BACK! There you
have it. That’s right, four in a row.
Over the weekend of November 5-
7, the Davidson College field
hockey team became the Deep
South Tournament Champion for
the fourth consecutive time.

The Wildcats played three

hard-fought games against Appa-
lachian St., Catawba, and Virginia
Tech and won each of them, end-
ing their season witha strong record
of 12-7-1.

In the first game against Ap-
palachian St., the Wildcats had
some difficulty adjusting to
Catawba’s slow, rug-like field, and
the score of the game remained

tied after the first half. In the sec-
ond part of the game, however, the
Wildcats got their timing down
and they began to play effectively

with’ their usual Small passing °

game.

The entire Davidson team
played offensively as their pres-
sure on the Appalachian goalie was
intense. Nicole Ficeto broke the 0-

0 tie when she scored a beautiful
goal on a deflection off of a cross
from Missy Potts. Davidson scored
their second goal on a flawless
corner play:

Holly Kledis hit the ball out to
Ficeto who stopped the ball for
Erin Lang. Lang proceeded to give
a perfect pass back over to Kledis
who swept the ball into the far

comer of the cage. The teamwork
couldn’t have been prettier. The
final score of the game was 2-0
thanks to the sophomore-scoring-
duo.

In their game on Saturday, the
Wildcats got a case of “scoring
fever” against Catawba. Davidson

V-ball hopes
for upsets in
SC tourney

By Matt Pitzer

After two losses Friday and
Saturday to two of the tougher
teams in the Southern Conference,
the volleyball team set its sights
squarely on this weekend’s con-
ference tournament knowing that
anything can happen.

“The main thing is to play the
teams in the conference tough dur-
ing the regular season,” coach
Carolyn Blake. “The conference
tournament is the place for up-
sets.”

Friday, the Wildcats lost to
Marshall, 13-15, 15-8, 15-13, and
15-12. On Saturday, East Tennes-
see State beat Davidson, also in
four games, 9-15, 15-5, 15-9, and
15-9. With the two losses,
Davidson fell to 12-21 overall and
2-5 in the conference. The Wild-
cats final regular season match is
Wednesday at UNC-Charlotte.

“They are one of the top teams
in the conference,” senior Amy
Howard said after the loss to the
Buecaneers. “It was a tough loss,
but I feel we’re ele for the tour-
nament.”

In Davidson’s final home
match of the season, the Bucca-
neers simply looked stronger than
the Wildcats. Howard said the team
was trying several tactics to throw
ETSU’s offense off-balance.

Blake said she was pleased
with how the team changed its
style of play as the match wore on.
“T think we adjusted to their weak-
nesses nicely in the match,” she
said, “But they’re areal, consistent
team and they don’t have a lot of
weaknesses.”

The Wildcat defense played
well, sustaining long rallies, with
Michele Augustin playing espe-
cially well. “She was unbeliev-
able,” Blake said. “She put on a
defensive clinic.”

This season, Davidson has
played a tough schedule, including
North Carolina and three teams
during a trip to California, but those
opponents helped the Wildcats to
inconsistent results, with a lengthy
slump during October.

“We had some low points back
there in October,” Blake said. “But
we’ve seen a lot of maturing over
the last month.” She singled out
Augustin, Tara Smith, and Ami
Bondurant as especially improv-
ing. “They’re more consistent and
they have more self-confidence.”

Part of the Wildcats problem
was their youth, only two seniors -

College football took a wacky turn Saturday

By Will Cobb

The college football season
took a wacky turn last weekend. It
appears that once again the post
season will hold reduced drama
for the National Championship.

Poor Bobby Bowden set up a
demanding out-of-conference
schedule that was too tough for the
best team in college football. The
history of Notre Dame did not
strike, it was Lou Holtz and the
well coached offensive and defen-
sive lines that simply dominated

the Seminoles. Maybe next year .

Coach Bowden, you will get no
rematch.

By the end of the season the
sportswriters will have the mighty
Nebraska Cornhuskers and their
tough Big 8 schedule square off
against Notre Dame in the Orange
Bowl. Florida State, you had your
chance and unfortunately, the bow!
coalition will not deny an unde-
feated team the opportunity to play
for the National Championship.

Remember who Notre Dame
defeated for their last ring in 1988?
That team was a weak 11-0 West
Virginia squad that got destroyed
in the Fiesta Bowl. The season is
far from over though; Notre Dame
must play a hot Boston College
team, Nebraska must face rival
Oklahoma, Miami must play West
Virginia, the yellow bellied Ohio
State Buckeyes can pick up their
Rose Bowl check, and Florida State
must travel to “The Swamp” to
face Florida, so maybe we

shouldn’t count our chickens be-
fore they hatch.

What’s up with the Cleveland
Browns? Can you believe they let
go Bernie Kosar? The man who is
the most loved sports figure in
Cleveland since the great Jim
Brown. That’s like Chicago telling
Mike Ditka thanks but no thanks.
Or saying “Hey Warren Moon,
we're going to go with a third

string quarterback. Sorry to see
you go, but you were like a son to
us,” from the Houston Oilers. These
things shouldn’t happen.

The reason the Browns were
not scoring many points is because
they do not have an offensive coor-
dinator. The “dog pound” sure is
going to be upset and unfriendly
when they see Bernie Kosar have a
field day in Dallas. One last note
for the NFL, why did the Philadel-
phia Eagles pick up William “the
Refrigerator” Perry? If he’s no
good for the defense oriented Bears,
what impact could he have for the
Eagles?

I hate to say this, but Ken
Hatfield should go ahead and start

packing his bags. He could go 9-3

and Clemson wouldn’t be happy.

Hats off to Tim Landis and
Richard Howell. Head Coach
Landis landed the most wins in a
single season for Davidson since
1969. Howell got a nice write-up
in the Charlotte Observer before
breaking Davidson’s single sea-
son records by gaining 251 yards
of total offense while scoring 26
points (4 rushing TD’s, 1 passing

TD, 1 two pointconversion). Wow! —

Football is fun at Davidson again.
Congratulations to the coaching
staff, players, and especially those
seniors who have stuck it out for
the past four years.

6-4 record best
since 1979;

Howell in books.
By Neil Marks
The Wildcats ended a 6-4 sea-
son with a 55-14 victory over non-
conference opponent Bridgewater

- Saturday at Richardson Field.

Senior quarterback Richard
Howell delivered a record-break-
ing performance to end his
Davidson football career scoring a
school record 26 points and con-
necting with Del Turner for an-
other score.

Running the option to score a
record-tying four touchdowns,
Howell scored from three, six, 26
and 37 yards out and also rushed
for atwo point conversion. He also
brokeseason records with 18 touch-
downs and 110 points while fin-
ishing with 5,256 yards in total
career offense.

“There was a lot of emotion
involved in this game since it was
the last one and it was a great way |
to end the year and my career,”
explained Howell.

Howell rushed 13 times for
125 yards and completed seven of.
14 passes for 126 yards.

The Wildcat defense was cen-
tered on stopping Bridgewater
tailback Ronnie Howard. Howard,
whose performance was overshad-
owed only by that of Howell, ran
for touchdowns from 47 and 80
yards out. He also caught a two
point conversion and finished the
day with an astronomical 345 yards
of total offense.

The Davidson defenders were
led by linebacker John Dalton and
strong safety Frank Houghton.
Dalton had 11 tackles while
Houghton had 10 and an intercep-
tion. .
Davidson turned eight of their
first 10 possessions into touch-
downs, including a 51-yard touch-
down by Drew Fassett on a fake
punt.

The 55-14 victory was the big-
gest scoring output for the Wild-
cats since a 56-3 victory over
Southwestern in 1980 and gave
Davidson its first winning season
since 1990.

“We had a good year. The ball
didn’t always roll in our favor ev-
ery time and if a couple plays had
gone the other way we could have
been 8-2, but we’ve got tobe happy
with how we played and the win-
ning record,” said Howell.

' Coach Landis hopes the blow-
out will lead to greater achieve-
ments next year and achance at the
elusive 8 win season. It will be
tough without Howell.
