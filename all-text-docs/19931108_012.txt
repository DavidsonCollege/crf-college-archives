Big Star's not just a supermarket and Columbia proves it

By Tom Bavis

Imagine you are at a party
attended by members of some of
the coolest bands of the last decade
— including R.E.M.., the Replace-
ments, the Gin Blossoms, Teenage
Fanclub, the Bangles (when they
were still decent), and even
Davidson’s own Electro-luxe —
and they ask you to crank up some
music. With all their diverse tastes
and touchy egos, how could you
possibly pick something with
enough universal appeal to keep
them all from smashing an electric
mandolin on your head?

Hopefully you would have a
copy of the newly-released record-
ing of the reunion concert from the
one group cited by all of them as a
favorite and influence — Big Star.

“Big Star,” you ask, “Isn’t that a
grocery store?” To their small
legion of ardent fans, Big Star the
group has long since meant more
than the supermarket after which
they named themselves. The group

never reunited since their final split '

in 1974, but their tragic history has
made itself a place in rock n’ roll
legend.

The group’s record label could
not properly manage the group or
distribute its records. They be-
came frustrated and disintegrated
almost as soon as it formed. Asa
result, their three albums, #7
Record (1972), Radio City (1974),
and Sister Lovers (also 1974) are
filled with an interesting mix of
restrain and chaos that soars over
musical trends. The albums are

among the bestkeptsecrets in rock
music, conveying emotion with
soulful playing that has been si-
multaneously compared to the
Beatles and R & B.

After almost twenty years and
the loss of two original members (a
guitarist died and the bassist
dropped out of music), I didn’t
think singer/guitarist Alex Chilton
and drummer Jody Stephens could
get together and show any connec-
tion to their distant past. Yet Co-
lumbia, a 50 minute recording of
their first and only reunion show
earlier this year at Missouri Uni-
versity, is far from the nostalgia
trip I feared.

Quite the contrary, Chilton and
Stephens, with the help of Ken
Stringfellow and Jon Auer of the
Posies, tear through the Big Star
catalogue with as much soul and
more guts than the original record-
ings. The show hits an early cli-
max with “Don’t Lie to Me,” an
angry rocker about, to put things
simply, standing uptopeople. With
the guitars screaming like a derail-
ing train, the band barely holds
together as Alex screams, “I told
my dad andnowI’mtelling you—
don’t push me ‘round!” It’s rabid,
its illiterate, and it rocks as hard as
anything I’ve ever heard.

Beyond that, Big Star proves
with Columbia that they can do
more than just tear their vocal cords
apart. The soulful version of “The
Ballad of El Goodo,” already one
of the most beautiful songs of the
past 50 years, beats the likes of
seasoned romantic songwriters
Marc Cohn and James Taylor at
their own game. Chilton still
sounds like the philosophical 21
year-old he was when he wrote the
song: “It gets so hard at times like
nowtohold on; but [know I’ve got
to stand or fall and I believe I’m
going to stand tall.”

Among the eleven stunning

originals are three covers. The
first two, “Baby Strange” and
“Slut,” are rollicking classics from
the Seventies intended to keep the
band from getting overly emo-
tional. The third cover was “I am
the Cosmos,” playedin memory of
its writer, the late Big Star guitarist
Chris Bell.

Every song, original or other-
wise, makes up in soul and deter-
mination what it loses from sloppy
playing and reunion jitters. Ken
Stringfellow and Jon Auer of the
Posies play stunningly. Their per-
fection is not surprising; The Po-

sies’ have made a career out of
reworking the Big Star sound.
Their starry-eyed enthusiasm
complements the maturity of
Chilton and Stephens.

With this beautiful chemistry
the young guys are somehow able
to relax among their idols and the
old veterans regain their youthful
vigor.

All together the performance
was, as Chilton is quoted in the
liner notes, “loose as a goose, and
it rocked more than the first time
around.” Columbia has made mea
Big Star fan all over again.

Davidson weeps for teen idol

By Susan Warren
The death of teen idol River
Phoenix shocked and surprised
many Davidson students. Phoenix
collapsed early last Sunday morn-
ing in Los Angeles outside a night-
club. Though the cause of death
has yet to be determined, his brother
who was with him said he had been
using drugs.
Phoenix was 23 years-old.
He was best known for his role in
Stand By Me and his Academy
Award nomination for Running on
Empty.
“TI didn’t feel much grief. It’ s
too bad that a young person has to
die before living a full life,” said
junior Ashley Atkins.

_ Sophomore Mary Laura

Moretz said, “It has such a big

impact not because he’s one of the
greatest actors that ever lived, but
because he’s close to our age and
we identified with him, especially
in Stand By Me.”

Sophomore Meredith Hayden
spoke about his death saying, “It
made me mad that everyone as-
sumed it was a drug overdose.”

Sophomore Eliza Edgar wasa
big fan on River Phoenix when she -
was younger and spoke of his death
saying, “I was so surprised I did
not believe he was dead. He was
my idol in seventh grade because
of Stand By Me. His death is arude
awakening.”

Sophomore Sarah Webster
spoke about his death as a “large
dose of reality that movie stars are
not invincible.”

means to me
or the breadth of the compass. Re-
member, I really don’t know what
I’m talking about.

I see Country music as some-
thing else entirely. To me, itis life
itself. All the sorrow, all the joy,
all the simplicity, all the complex-
ity, all the religion, everything—
it’s all there. Pain and Happiness
encompass everything in one long
sine curve with no beginning and
no end, and, thank God, there’s a
Country song to match every point
along the way.

I don’t know. Maybe that’s
trying to make too much out of it.
L listen to it and.I enjoy it. Hon-
estly, nothing else really matters. I
don’t care what you’re listenin’ to
as long as you’re happy. Knock
yourself out with your rave, rap,
and metal. Have a ball.

As for me, I’ll be “down at
Emnie’s ice house, liftin’ longnecks
to that good old Country sound.”
