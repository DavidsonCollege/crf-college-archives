Union Board Policy Committee

-Redistributes Funds

In an effort to help out some of its fi-
nancially- ‘Strapped committees, the
Union. Board Policy Committee ‘last
month redistributed the ‘appropriations
forthe Union committees.

The redistribution did not erase the
projected. shortfall, ‘however. Union
President Mike Goode said the Union
must make up $3000 this term from ad-
missions to Union events, such as Pop
Films, Deathtrap, the touring play that
performed in Love Auditorium this
week, and “through anything we can
charge admission for.”

The redistribution was necessary
because some committees had over-
spent their budgets during Fall and Win-
ter terms. “We spent a lot more money
this year, fast,” Goode said. The Col-

lege Bowl, Games, Fine Films, and Pop -

Films committees all had used up their
appropriations for the year, so the new
chairmen who took over Spring term
had no money to work with, or even a
debt. Fine Films,.and the President’s
conti
shape with $1250 and $1137 debts re-

spectively.

- The Policy Committee redistributed .

the available money from the: solvent
committees to those in need of help.

The Educational Policies Committee
voted dast. Monday to adopt the SGA’s

proposed alternative grading. scale: for .
discussion-purposes until their next;op- .

en meeting this Monday at 4 p.m. in
Chambers Gallery.

The SGA proposal comes in response
to the EPC’s earlier suggestion that min-
uses be added to our present grading
scale. Two student senators, Chip Hur-
ley and Mark Oldenburg, used the Col-

C Open Meeting

, lege’s computer to predict the effect of

minus grades on school-wideGPA’s:.
Because minus grades would carry. re-

. duced points, their. results showed that

many students” averages would suffer.
The. senators then drew up this scale,
which the EPC approved:

A:4, 00/93- 100
A-:3.75/90-92
B plus:3.50/87-89

. B:3.25/83-86

B-:3.00/80-82

C plus:2.50/77-79
C:2.25/73-76
C-:2.00/70-72

D plus?! .50/67-69
D:1.00/60-66

Under the newly proposed plan, GPA’s
would stay nearly the same for students
who make some low grades and some
high grades. Adding an A plus would
create a 4.5 point scale, causing much
more confusion than help. The SGA
will “support this wholeheartedly,” said
freshman Senator Meg: Surratt, if any
change at all must be:made.

The reason for the original EPC plan
to add minuses was so that professors
could distinguish fairly between a B-
and a B. Professor of Religion Max E.
Polley, who serves on the committee of
elected faculty and students, said, “We
had no interest in reducing GPA’s.”
However, the petition signed ‘by ap-
proximately 450 students last week in
opposition to any change. show ‘that
many. students: would rather leave the
system as it has been for over 20 years.

If the EPC approves the SGA’s sug-
gestion in their next open meeting on

. MondayApril 12), then the faculty will

vote either to accept or reject:the point
values -of the letter-grades. However,
the meaning of letter-grades will always
depend on the - individual professor:
There is no ‘absolute: numerical scale
now; nor will the proposed plan become
“binding on the-faculty member,” ex-
plained Professor’ Polley. Speaking for
the EPC, he added, ‘We appreciate the
SGA’s:- work.”

., All studenits are: invited to the EPC’s
open meeting on Monday at 4: p.m. in
the Gallery to.ask questions, make com-

_ments, or simply: listen and learn.
