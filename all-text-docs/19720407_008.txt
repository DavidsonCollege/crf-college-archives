The Davidsonian

Blacks Gradually

Move Into Polities

By JOHN CASSELS
Staff Writer

Two hundrec years after Sam
Adams spoke out for American
independence. Samuel Adams of
the University of South Florida
is speaking out for the vower of
Black Politics in America.

Samuel Adams. Assistant Dir
ector. Minorities Division for
the National Democratic Com-
mittee, spoke on the Davidson
campus Monday morning and
evening on the topic ‘Blacks
and the New Politics of the
70's."

“When we think of the new
politics.’ Adams said. “we must
think of the urgent situations
which mold these new politics.”

Adams recently atteaded the
Black National Convention in
Gary. Indiana. We said the
Black Convention di: not re

American Convention had to har

“The Democrats have mace

He pointed out that Blacks
have started to work toward ed-
ucating themselves to the sys-
tem of political power. ‘Blacks
are dealing in chalk. not talk.
They are teaching nationhood
and pride.”

Turning to the problem of
racial prejudice, Adams said,
“There is an inability among
the white administration to un-
derstand Blacks. White Amer-
ica is liable to misread a con-

vention such as Gary. . . .white
people are sometimes hiding
reir prejudices in new words
and terms: Law and Order.
Neighborhood Schools... . . The

real tragedy is the White and
Blacks who think they under-
stand. No one can really under-
stand the welfare. non-educated
situation from the outside.”

Mazrui Considers African
Politics Sacred But Secular

the theme of “The Sacred

Ali Mazrui, an internationalls
distinguished political
from Kampala. Ugande. deliv-
ered the final Reynolds lectures
for the vear on Tuesday. Wed

Introducing the series of lec

‘ne black mam. He took as a

premise for his remarks that
origins are sacred.”
Ii his first lecture, ‘Secular

es. Mazrui pointed to the sec-
lar ‘meritocracies” that have
power in many Af.
States in which a small
minority of well-educated peo-
ple dominate the government.
Though the positions are secu-
arly-based, Mazrui said that
the chiefly background of many
of these leaders indicates resi-

buldings) have been estimated
at $5,000,000.

The cost of dormitor.es is
based on four structures. each
housing 100 students at a total
cost of approximately $4,125,000.

Mr. Grover Meetze, Director
of the Physical Plant. supplied
the committee with these cost
estimates.

Additional housing for 400
students, combined with the pre-
sent available housing for 945,
will provide space for 1345 of

the 1500 projected enrollment.

It is felt this will be adequate
in view of the current problem
of keeping present facilities fill-
ed te capacity and the increase
in the number of students who
will spend some portion of the

academic year away from the

Campus.

As stated previously, it is as-
Sumed that additional student
housing will be financed through
low-interest government loans

pa.d over a 40-year’ period.

To insure the availability of
funds for modifications of exist-
ing structures which may be re-
quired, we recommend that
$875,000 be raised for the Plant

Fund within the first three
years.
The subcommittee has con-

cluded that coeducation is eco-
nomically feasible provided en-
dowment funds can be increased
by $12,550,000; plant funds can
be increased by $875,000; and
that low-interest government
loans are available for the con-
Struction. of student housing.

He explained the prevalence
of “‘spiritualized" politics by
pointing to a widespread polit-
ical nostalgia. Many Africans,
he stated, ‘‘have a deep long.
ing to go back to the ‘good old
days’ including those of colon-
ial control.

“This phenomenon arises from
an idealization of the political

past, which depends largely on
the ‘political memory’,” he
said.

According to Mazrui. the two
forms of political nostalgia are
those of resignation and resto-
ration. The former only ideal-
izes the past, whereas the lat-
ter actually is comm:tted to re-
turn to the past

Mazrui also discussed the im-
portance for a developing na-
tion to possess some deg
“pol: ical amnesia,” ie
ity to forget. He drew

ree of
the abil
a paral

lel between the civ! wars of
the U.S. and of Nigeria. stating
that perhaps in Nigeria, as in

the U. S, the defested rebels
will continue to hate the ‘fed
erals,” but will nonetheless de-
velop a strong lovalt,
ed nation.

Mazrui summed up the rela-
‘ionship between the sacred and

“The blacks here are walking
a tightrope, a fine line between
two worlds. We are like a sta
tionary bridge. not really a part
of either world, vet trying to get
the best of both worlds.”

Not all blacks feel quite like
that. Some feel closer to the
white society and its value sys
tem. Most have a very strong
need for a relationship with the
black culture in this country
and the values it holds.

Many feel an alienation from
the college. This ‘s most ap

The black ‘students recognize
that there are differences in

lLoked on as a group and re-
ferred to as “them.” They feel
that they are not accepted as
students but as “‘black  stud-
ents.” “We are not taken on am
individual basis. and yet we
have to stand together to be
heard.”

The Black Student Coalition
is ‘he organization through
which these students attempt to
be heard. It is also their only
alternative to the social aliena,
uucn of the Davidson situation.

Ye. this organization is slow-
ly being forced out of its facili-
tes. It now occupies two
in Lingle Manor. This
year, the kitchen facilities,
which had been part of the
Coalition office, have become
part of the facilities designated
for use by the art department.
With the possibility of increased
hlack evrollment next year, the
facilities will become too small.

The black students are skep-
‘ical about the increased en-
rollment. Most of them feel that
Dav.dson has little that it can
offer to incoming black stu-
dents.

Some

“rooms”

expressed a_ conscious
aitempt to inform black recruits
on the campus of the realities
«f Davidson life. One black stu-
dent explaried that ‘“‘Life (at
Davidson) is all roses in the
admissions office and all hell
everywhere else (on campus).”

The hell experienced by each
of the black students is differ-
ent. Each has a different per-
specive on how to cope with
h.s situation at Davidson. Three
fourths of the black freshmen
ure transferring or sariously
considering that alternative.
Others aie happy in the lives
that they have had: to create
out of a void. Some try to be-
come absorved in their studies.

kach of these students is
looking for some relief to the
alienation and = misunderstand-
ing that they experience daily
at Davidson. They want to be
accepted as individuals, as stu-
dents, and not be a teken mino-
rity on this campus. The. ques-
tion they ask and which Dawvid-
on must answer is, “Can you
ce us as human beings and can
vou give up some of your white
values t accept us as individ-.
uuls?
