FREDDY MARTIN AND ORCHESTRA
~~ MAKE MID-WINTERS SUCCESSFUL

Band Leader Expresses Musical Views to Davidsonian Re-

Begun Playing at Sixteen. ~

PREFERS SMOOTH MUSIC

Band to Open Next Week At

Cntervicwed by Richard Vovles)
An orchid to Freddy Martin and

his versatile orchestra, of Palmer

House and Waldoysf-Astoria fame,

for making Davidson College Mid-

Winters the first really “big” set

of dances in the last four years.

In a backstage interview during
the intermission, Martin, a man of
small stature but great personality,
commented on his success in music.

“T have always been interested in
music, having begun by playing
drums at the age of sixteen, al-
though my present instrument is the
saxophone. About four and one-
half years ago, I got my first big
orchestra job, in Brooklyn, and
since then, we have playéd at the
Palmer House, in Chicago, on the
Vicks ‘Open House’ broadcast, and
recently at the Waldorf-Astoria, in
New York. A week from today we
will open at the Aragon Ballroom,
in Chicago, for a five-year run,
nine months out of each year, after
which we will leave for Cocoanut
Grove.”

“Does your style of playing differ
essentially when you play at. the
Waldorf-Astoria?” -

“Yes, considerably. Those who
come to dine and dance do so for
recreation and rest after working.
Therefore they like soft smooth
music. Tonight is the first night
in four weeks I have played “The
Music Goes ‘Round and: Around.”
1 never play “Tiger Rag,” or “St.
Louis Blues,” I don’t like them.”

“How do you like the South and
North Carolina dancing?”

“Fine. Southern dances are much
better, and this Davidson set is the
best for which I have played. Danc-

ing here is smooth, not jerky and

‘yee as it is up there. And better

than that, there are a lot more

beautiful girls!. Then, too, people
are more cordial and hospitable to-
ward us, instead of being cold and
impersonal as they are up North.”
“T noticed that you were surprised

Mr.—Tom_ Ross with _Miss_ Hannah
Knowlton. Phi Delta Theta, Mr.
John Partridge with Miss Mary Poy-
ner, and Mr. Albert Price with Miss
Lois Montague, and Signa Phi Ep-
silon, Mr. Wiley Bradley with Miss
Jean Orr, and Mr. Martin Barnett
with Miss Jane Hunter.

The second dance in the series was
a Saturday afternoon tea dance held
from four until six-thirty o'clock. The
last dance was Saturday night from
cight-thirty until twelve. Between
these two dances all of the social fra-
ternities had banquets or dinners at
various places in Charlotte. .

Freddy Martin, coming directly
irom New York where he has been
playing at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel,
held the Davidson students with their
dates in constant awe with the de-
lightful arrangements of the current
popular pieces and proclaimed the set
of dances the largest and best attend-
ed that have ever been given by the
Pan-Helienic Council. His band fea-
tured Elmer Feldkamp, baritone, the
two-piano team of Terry Shand, blues
singer, and Jack Fina; the Martin-
ettes, a vocal trio; and Freddy Mar-
tin himself who is a true artist with a
saxophone. Outstanding among , his.
novelty arrangements were; “Goody
Goody,” “Lights Out,". and “Broken
Record.”

There were four no-breaks ‘at ‘each
dance. Instead of conforming to the
playing of one waltz for each no-break
the orchestra played several melodies
as onc piece sometimes intermingling
waltzes and fox trots. The orchestra
was secured by contract from-theMus-
ical Corporation of America. It opens
a series of engagements at the Ara-
gon-Trianon Ballroom in Chicago’
next week. One of the most unique
facts to be noted about this orchestra,
very seldom found in other orchestras,
is that it contained three violins, with
a brass section of only one trumpet
and one trombone.

Among the chaperones at the dances
were: Mr. and Mrs. Grier Martin,
Mr. and Mrs. Emmet* Fulcher, Dr.
and Mrs. Scott Lyon, Professor and
Mrs. William McGavock, Mrs. J. T.
Rhett,_Professor Baitey,-Mrs. O. M.
Dyerle, Mrs. Pi H. Arrowsmith and
Dr. and Mrs. McKay.

The following statement was made

at the word ‘no-break.’ Is that-new
to you?”

“Yes. [had never Neard the term
before. I even forgot the word in
making announcements.”

In regard to the composition ‘of
his band. Freddy Martin commented
freely. “We prefer smooth music,
although the tendency is
‘swinging it’ at the present. There-
fore. we have a violin trio, a sax
trio, and only two brass, besides
the rhythm. section. One trumpet
and one trombone serve my pur-
pose, despite the trend toward larg-
I also believe it
best to have two pianos. The bene-
fits of these two cannot be realized
when they are so far apart. how-
ever.”

In talking to various members of
the orchestra, this interviewer dis-
covered a varicty of interesting
facts. The first pianist. Jack Vina,
who-attracted much attention from
passing dancers, was formerly with
Benny Goodman; while the “wha-
wha” trombonist, Ernie Gibbs, has
played with Leo Reisman and Eddie
Duchin. Terry Shand, vocalist and
second pianist, said “there are only
five of the original group out of
the fourteen of us. I and [Etmer
Feldkamp. the other vocalist, be-
gan with Freddy.”

Of the group, the versatile pian-
ist. Jack Fina, attracted most ad-
miration from his brilliant piano
work. That, a muted trumpet, and
a “hot fiddle” largely characterize
the orchestra as to individual play-
ing. Strange to say, Freddie Mar-
tin uses the C melody saxophone
for himself, despite the fact that
it is seldom used in orchestral work.
This sax is especially well suited
to Martin's orchestra however, as
it harmonizes well with three ten-
ors. Another rarity’ also the
happy-faced Marty left-
handed drummer.

In commenting on popular music,
Freddy Martin said “jazz” will
never dic out It may change from
time to time, but it will never dis-
appear. As I said, the present ten-
dency is toward “swing stuff.” but
that is only a passing fancy.

(By -tssociated Collegiate Press)

New York. (ACP)—You may
think you'd like to marry money,
but the chances are that when you
come to a decision you.won't much
care,

At least’ this attitude is inditated
hy a six-year survey of the prob-
lem just completed by Dr. Erwin
Jaber, Proivgsor of Sociology in
New York University

Dr. Baber, who conducts a course
at the university's Washington
Square College entitled “Marriage
and Fanly Life.” interviewed G12
college students and 220 parents on
the matter of choosing a marriage
pariner,

The students, 321 young men and
321 young women, declared that
economic status was a matter of
sinafl coneern when it came to se-
lecting a mate. since 93 per cent of
the men said that they avould marry
a girl of lower cconomic rank than
their_own, and S2-per cent of the
women were of the same opinion.

Not so many of the parents (105
fathers and 115 motaers) took the
same view of the question. Sixty-
three per ceat ot the fathers de-
clared that they would be willing
to allow their daughters to marry
a- person of lower economic rank
and 69 per cent of ’the mothers
aereed.

On the qnestion “would you mar-

ry. a person of lower_moral_stand-

arcs than your awn?’s 20 per cent
of the men answered yes and one-
fitth of the women replied affirma-
tively.

Fifty-eight per cent of the men

this fact.” ‘
