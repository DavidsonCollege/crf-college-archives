Sigma Upsilon
Holds Meeting

Dr. Hood Adds Chapter
To The Serial Epic

Four members took part in the
program at the meeting of Sigma
Upsilon held Tuesday night at the
Phi Gamma Delta House.

Bill Sprunt, in charge of the pro-
gram, first announced a short story
that was read by Sam Spencer.
Following criticism of Spencer's
contribution, Dan Hodges present-

‘ed a light story entitled “Sketch
on a House Party,” in which several
high school boys and girls lent sub-
ject matter for the rather humorous
plot.

Following the feed managed by
Ed Taylor, Shaw Smith was called
on for a number of his own poems,
after which the program was con-
cluded by the next chapter of the
multi-authored_epic, “J” Lysander
Mallory.”

Most of the members were pres-
ent and the meeting was very suc-
cessful according to Arch Taylor,
president of the organization.
