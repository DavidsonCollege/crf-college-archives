Know the facts about Battle Report:
oral contraceptives

By KATE WILLIAMS
Health Advisor

Many people have considered the health
effects of OC (oral contraceptives, not the
show). In fact, it is the most widely-
researched medicine in history, and consider-
ing the fact that 80 percent of women in the
US have taken birth control at some point in
their lives, this should come as no surprise.

Modern combined hormonal contracep-
tives, which are different from the pill your
mom took when Nixon was president, con-
tain low dosages
of estrogen (usu-
ally ethinyl estra-
diol) and prog-
estins. Currently
there are nine
different prog-
estin compounds
used, depending
on the pill.

Oral contra-
ceptives work
hard for their 99
percent efficien-
cy. The hor-
mones in OC
work in several
different ways:
first they block your body’s natural luteiniz-
ing hormone surge, preventing ovulation. In
the remote possibility your body still pro-
duces a viable egg while on birth control, the
pill also thickens cervical mucus effectively
preventing sperm from reaching the fallopi-
an tube (the site of fertilization). In addition,
oral contraceptives alter the vascular struc-
ture and thus the composition of the
endometrium, preventing a fertilized egg
from implanting in the uterus.

It is critical to remember that birth control
pills dramatically lose effectiveness if they
are not taken everyday at the same time. For
those of us who find this inconvenient, other
combined hormone contraceptives, such as
the ring and the patch, are here to save the
day.

80 percent of women nin the US have taken
birth control at some point in their lives.

With the widespread use of OC it is impor-
tant to understand the long-term health
effects. Recent research indicates there are
many possible health benefits for young
women taking birth control, including:
reduction in negative side effects of menstru-
ation (including PMS), reduction in acne, an
increase in HDL cholesterol and a decrease
in LDL cholesterol, improved lung mechan-

_ ics, reduced risk of developing endometrial

and ovarian cancer, anemia, rheumatoid
arthritis, and even osteoporosis.

The pill, however, is not perfect. Not only
is it surprising-
ly difficult to
take everyday
at the same
time, it is also
unsuitable for
some women
because it
increases the
risk for blood
clots, hyperten-
s ion ,
melanoma,
gallbladder dis-
ease, _ breast
cancer,
Chlamydia and
HIV. However,
any risk of side effects in healthy college-age
women is vastly outweighed by the potential
health benefits.

Although the pill is a safe and effective
method to prevent pregnancy, it does nothing
to prevent sexually transmitted diseases.
Health experts recommend sexually active
college. women to pair OC and condoms in
order to prevent STDs. Remember the
mantra, safe sex is good sex.

Fortunately there are a wide variety of
pills and other contraceptive methods avail-
able on the market, which is both a blessing
and a curse as OC have become designed for
specific body chemistries and personal
desires, the process of matching yourself to a
pill has become an increasingly daunting
task.
