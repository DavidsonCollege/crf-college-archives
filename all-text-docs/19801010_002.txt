New Women’ s Center seeks serious discussion of women’s issues

By SALLY CAMPBELL

‘Davidson’s new Women’s
Center has drafted a tentative
statement of purpose to inform
the campus of its existence and
its intentions.

The Women’s Center, located
in the house between the Presi-
dent’s Home and Martin Man-
or, gives women a place to
discuss ‘‘issues which directly
affect’”’ them, according to the
statement of purpose.

Senior Karen Hester, co-
chairperson of the Davidson
branch of the National Organiz-
ation for Women, said the
Center also ‘‘wants a lot of
speakers and programs and
discussions that men would feel
comfortable coming to so they
could be sensitized to women’s
issues."’ Such programs might
include topics such as abortion,
ERA, politics, and career-fam-
ily-marriage problems, all of
which directly or indirectly
involve men,” Hester said.

Last spring several members
of the Council on Campus and
Religious Life complained about
the establishment of the Center.
They felt the house should have
been set aside for men.

Housing Director Bill Bold-
ing, however, said there was a
“lack of choice and diversity for
women’s housing’”’ last spring,
but there were three apartments
and one perimeter house reserv-
ed exclusively for men.

After he designated a house
to be the Women’s Center,
Bolding said he recognized a
“great need’’ at Davidson for an
organization to encourage wo-
men to explore their roles and
potential. He stressed that the
Women’s Center is ‘not design-
ed to be a feminist organiza-
tion” but. is to ‘focus on the
strengths of women.”

Associate Dean of Students
Sue Ross said that when women
first entered Davidson, their

primary goal was to show they
could compete with the men.

Now that they have accomplish- .

ed this, ‘Women aren’t hesitant
to say ‘we are different.””’ The
Center can be a place for them
to articulate these differences,
Ross said.

Bolding said it would be a
‘great help if men would be
involved”’ in the Women’s Cen-
ter. ‘‘Probably people who need
education most on strengths of
women is men,”’ he said.

The governing structure of
the Center is largely undefined
as yet. Sharp, Ross and Bolding
will probably appoint a Wo-
men’s Center Board of six

students and two faculty or
staff members to run the Center
this year, and future Boards
would be chosen through inter-
views conducted by outgoing
Boards, Hester said.

Hester emphasized that the
Center is open to ‘‘college
women. The organization will
be broadly based so that ‘‘any
woman would feel comfortable
going into the Center,’’ she
said.

gram Director Sally Sharp em-

good first year for the Center.
“The College is beginning to
recognize the special needs of
women on campus and they’re
making important, concrete
changes...(but) it’s crucial to
make this year work. We’ve got
to show we’re serious about
this, ” Hester said.

Funds for the Center will not
come from any particular de-
partment budget. Sharp said,

job placement

The SGA wants to suggest
improvements in the Center for
Life/Work Planning’s job
placement program and is plan-
ning a poll as a first step,
according to Junior Elliott Stot-
ler.

Stotler, chairman of an SGA
committee concerned with job
placement, said the poll will be
diesigned to identify the parts
of the job placement program
most helpful to students, rather
than to pinpoint any weaknes-
ses in it.

After Stotler’s committee
completes the: survey forms, it
will mail them to members of
the Class of 1980 who participa-
ted in the job placement pro-
gram, a total of about 30
alumni.

Stotler expects the committee
will complete the survey forms
and have them in the mail
within a week. If the alumni
answer promptly, the commit-
tee will announce results by the
end of the month, Stotler said.

need,’’ since no specific pro-
grams have been set. Sharp
hopes the Center will sponsor
some joint programs with Un-
ion committees.

There will be a reception at
the Center honoring the new
women faculty members this
Sunday, Oct. 5, from 4 to 6
p.m. ‘‘The reception (is) to get
things off the ground,’’ Sharp
said. She urged all College
women to attend.
