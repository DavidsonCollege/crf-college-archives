THE DAVIDSONIAN

12 ics
Fashion Plate_

Resurrected

By Cat Grimmell

Another school year well on
its way! And thankfully, by the
blessed interventions of the gods
and goddesses that be, a new line
of fall fashions. A few hints: boots
are in, knee-high in any color, worn
with shorter hemlines and tights;
punk reigns again; and, alas, the
early 80's plasticy pants and Pat
Benetar cool will soon be seen in
suburban malls.

Always creative, the rulers of
the runways of Paris, Rome, and

New. York have invented many
more ways to fulfill the obsessive
consumer’s need to be hip. (Ouch!
self-criticism hurts).

But since my personal obses-
sion continues, never fear; I will
still try to bring you the best of the
best, (and the truly lame) from the
world of high fashion, But first, as
students recover from the trials of
moving back to college, I will fo-
cus on what is going on in the
world of interiors.

Last year, chintz was officially

declared back from the dead. As
interior designers begin to pick the
floweriest of the chinsiest material
to decorate rooms, another deco-
rating movement is also being re-
newed. The movement toward
oriental decorating, at the height of
its popularity in the 70's, is being
revived by our generation of inte-
rior designers.

Vogue recently declared the
hottest type of home designs are
those with multicultural influences

Music Review

Forrest Gump soundtrack

P>

~~)

almost like a box of chocolates

By Tom Bavis

Almost everything about
Forrest Gump is addictive. The
images, stories, and music of the
summer’s biggest film have
grabbed such a tight hold of view-
ers’ imaginations that many have
dropped $20 to get the only me-
mento anyone can now take home
with them.

The Forrest Gump soundtrack
describes itself on the cover as “32
American Classics on 2 CD’s.”
Even limiting itself to American
artists from the 50’s, 60’s, and
70’s, the makers of this collection
had an immense catalog from
which-to pick the perfect period
pieces. The first disc begins with
one of the biggest songs of the
film, The King’s “Hound Dog.”
From there the first CD meanders
through the first decade and a half
of the rock n’ roll era in loose
chronological order.

Most of the highlights of the

_ first disc coincide with the end of

the 60’s, Forrest’s post-Vietnam
years. Buffalo Springfield’s “For
What it’s Worth” waxes ominous
of the social unrest to come:
“There’s battle lines being drawn/
Nobody’s right if everybody’s
wrong...Everybody stop, hey,
what’s that sound/ everybody look
what’s going ‘round.” “Fortunate
Son” by Creedence Clearwater
Revival spits the venom of full-

‘blown bitterness towards the war.

and its draft. Most of the rest of
disc one, as well as the first half of
disc two, take you through the im-
ages of the sixties, from its most
ideal moments (The Byrds’ “Turn!
Turn! Turn!”’) to its nightmarish
fantasies (The Doors’ “Break on
Through”).

Forrest Gump begins to lose
some musical steam as the ‘70’s
arrive. The standouts from the
slim pickings of the cheesiest de-
cade of Forrest’s life: Three Dog

Night’s “Joy to the World” and
Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “Sweet Home
Alabama.” Disc two’s redemption
comes in the form of the last two
popular songs as the eighties ap-
pear on the horizon. The first, “On
the Road Again,” suits Forrest’s
“jogging” years perfectly. Bob
Seger’s “Against the Wind” pro-
vides the soundtrack with the per-
fect tear-jerking finale.

Like the periods of popular
music from which they are pulled,
the selections for the Forrest Gump
soundtrack miss almost as often as.
they hit. In particular, one should
flee from Jackie DeShannon’s
painful “What the World. Needs
Now is Love” and Gladys Knight’s
disco diatribe “I’ ve Got to Use My
Imagination.” But the occasional
disappointment should be expected
from the story of a man who be-
lieves that “life is just a box of
chocolates— you never know what
you’re going to get.”

now). What does that mean? It
means that designers have started
to look to far-off for their inspira-
tion, and that these cultural inter-
pretations of fabric and paper rep-
resent a multitude of ethnicities
blended into a myriad of color and
consonance.

Our generation’s designers
represent in their creations the so-
cieties in which they live. I hope
that, one day, each of us can find
the type of beauty in our relation-
ships across cultural lines that are
reflected in these new, hot interi-
ors. (I had better ask my editor if a
fashion column is allowed to have
meaning before they print this).

Asian prints and tapestries
abound in these new designs, and
this move toward cultural interiors
has created another interesting phe-
nomenon. Elite furniture stores
which once specialized in only the
finest antique reproductions now
are carrying only the finest repro-
ductions of many of the items col-
lege dorm rooms have contained
since the 60's. Welcome to grunge
furniture!

For many years, college stu-
dents have returned from abroad
with strange decorations— trea-
sures, and, of course, the ever-
popular tapestry. So, in an attempt
to see how Davidson students are
keeping abreast of the latest deco-

rating trends, I began my research ~
braving the staircases of Cham-
bers. The question I asked was:
What is the coolest thing you have
in your room?

I’ve found that after extensive
interviews Davidson students’ re-
sponses could be grouped into three
categories:

THE SENTIMENTAL: Hal
Dougherty: My Perry Fu Fu Dog!
Georgia Ringle: amouse made out
of clay that my daughter gave me.

_ Nick Troiano: alittle troll wearing -

an Irish soccer uniform that some-
one gave me yesterday. Senior
Bob Feezor: Freshman girls!
(What can I say y’all, the guy’s all
heart). Jane Brock: a very cute
boy (Hmmmmm... will suffice.)

THE MODEST: Jen Will-
iams: Myself! Amanda Bryan:
Me! ;
THE TRULY BIZARRE:
Russ Tarver: big handcrafted ce-
ramic owl with these really messed
upeyes (Ididn’task). Kurt Holmes:
Legos. Alex Purvis: An Animal
House poster of John Belushi. Josh
Worsham and Steve LeNard: our
blow-up love doll (This item is
extremely useful in New Jersey
due to the express lane for cars
with more than one passenger, and
I’m sure that’s exactly what they
were talking about...ummm...
yeah... exactly).

students and faculty, parents and
alums. With a pep rally and Lunar
Luau beginning the festivites on
Friday evening, Saturday brings a
lawn party, bands, a parade, and
the Homecoming football game.
Despite initial concern over the
number of activities taking place
this weekend, the Davidson com-
munity remains committed to all
events taking place. Patterson
Court Council, initially discour-
aged with Lunar Luau being placed
on the same weekend as Home-
coming, “as a consensus did not
think it would be as effective.”
However, the PCC, according to
President Josh Worsham,’ “still
supports (Lunar Luau), but there

- probably will not be an individual

booth from each house.”

The festivities begin with a pep
rally at 8 p.m. Friday evening on
Richardson field featuring perfor-
mances by the Top Cat dancers,
the cheerleaders, the Cats Pajamas
gymnastics group, and of course
the mascots - Kitty and Wildcat.
The performances have been cho-
reographed by Karen Brown-
Sherrill of the Academy of Dance

Lunar Luau will immediately
follow the pep rally on Richardson
field. Representatives of Patterson
Court will be coordinating booths
as. well as sponsoring games and
refreshments from 8:30 until 10:30.
