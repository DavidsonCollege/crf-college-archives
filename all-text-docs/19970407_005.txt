Humanities seeking to correct sagging energy and morale

from page one

kind of language. Ithinkit’s healthy
for a campus to have that sort of
thing,” says Dr. Hansford Epes,
chair of the Humanities Program
and professor of German .

Strong as this common lan-
guage may be, it is often not enough
to keep people enthusiastic about
the progam. Even Epes says that
“the creative tension is frustrating
to all of us sometimes.”

The Religion Department sent
a memo questioning religion credit
being offered for Humanities to the
Educational Policy Committee
(EPC) and Epes on February 23.
The EPC is composed of eight fac-
ulty and staff members and two
non-voting students. Some exter-
nal speculation suggests that the
Religion Department’s decision to
offer a new, more comprehensive
introductory religion class may ex-
plain the department’s reconsidera-
tion of its involvement in Humani-
ties.

Still, while the Religion De-
partment is, as yet, the only depart-
mentto express dissatisfaction with
the treatment of its discipline in the
program, chair of the religion de-
partment Karl Plank says his de-
partment is not the only one which
is unhappy with results of the four-
semester sequence.

“The Religion Department was

a foundational. department of the
program, and it was heavily invested
in it from the beginning,” Plank
says. “If there is discontent within
the Religion Department, it is a part
of a larger system of morale in Hu-
manities. There is a concern for its
revitalization, discontent with the
inertia of the program. You can
find persons in all of the other de-
partments of Humanities with simi-
lar concerns. We responded to it as
a curricular situation.”

Religion Professor Lynn Po-
land agrees that the once-vibrant
program has lostits efficacy. “Once
upon a time, the Humanities pro-
gram was six days a week and it
now meets only three times a week.
There hasn’t been a serious, sit-
down, reassessment of what the pro-
gram can accomplish given its ab-
breviated time committment,” says
Poland who currently teaches in the
program. Poland believes each pro-
fessor enters Humanities with his or
her own agenda. Often, it is diffi-
cult to meet everyone’s desires.
“There are a number of things the
humanities program wants to do:
teach writing, toread and thinkcriti-

cally about text in the context of a °

group discussion, to provide a sense
of a broad sweep of Western hu-
manistic civilization,” she says.
“Depending on which of those
things is their priority, people get
frustrated with the ability of the

program to do that one thing well.”

Epes argues that Humanities is
no different from any other survey
course designed for freshmen and
sophomores. “Like other survey
courses, it tries to skip through a
great deal of time and doesn’t give
any one thing the attention it might
deserve,” he says.

Student opinion of the program
varies widely. “The typical pattern
is a great deal of enthusiasm for
Humanities at the beginning, con-
siderably less at the end of sopho-
more year and then numbers start
going back up at the end of the
senior year,” says Epes.

Senior Keith Kleeman fits that
example. “While enrolled, the Hu-
manities program was stressful and
not enjoyable. However, it was the
best thing academically I did at
Davidson,” he says.

Poland thinks that Humanities
has gone from having a multi-disci-
plinary nature to being non-disci-
plinary. She believes that lectures
are an ideal place to approach text
from a variety of disciplines.

“One result of the staff not re-
ally sitting down and talking about
the purpose of the program is that
we don’t really talk about what we
want lectures to do,” she says.

Freshman Paul Eubanks enjoys
his experience in Humanities lec-
tures. “Not always the most excit-
ing, the lectures are nonetheless in-

formative, well-organized, and fos-
ter thought on the task at hand,” he
says. “I think more panel discus-
sions would be beneficial because
students are able to hear and com-
pare ideas from different members
of the Humanities staff.”

Gibson says that Humanities
offers an excellent means for staff
to learn from each other. However,
Plank expressed discontent with the
ability of the whole staff to come

together. “There’s no real forum

for staff itself to get together to do
its business collaboratively, so if
you want to bring a charge it’s dif-
ficult. The Humanities staff itself
doesn’t gather to do this; that’s why
the memo went to the EPC instead
of Humanities.”

There are more complaints re-
garding Humanities beyond staff
communication. Students whohave
not taken the course feel frustrated
with the class’s exclusive study of
Western civilization.

“The emphasis of Humanities
should be thinking about the canon
critically, not being able to say what
itis. And presenting it chronologi-
cally is not necessary to understand
it,” says senior Kristen Richardson.
“Humanities seems to teach about
the greatest minds in history, but
doesn’t say why they are great. At
what expense were they rendered
great? It’s a white heterosexual
man’s history.”

“Tt’s the story of the male sub-
jugation of women,” says senior
Dennis Seavers. “In addition, you
study texts that deserve to be stud-
ied and only spend a day on them.
People come out feeling that they
know a subject when they don’t.
That is okay as long as everyone
knows that they are jettisoning depth
in place of breath.”

Sophomore Vic Brand is cur-
rently enrolled in the program and
agrees with Seavers.

“Tam getting to read things that
Iprobably wouldn’thave otherwise,
but not to any. great depth. The
quality of class discussion depends
often on who the leader is and the
student personalities in the class.”

The course's goal of satisfying
the composition requirement is of-

ten not met. “I donot think that the
humanities program is producing
good writers, or spending nearly
enough time teaching first- and sec-
ond-year students to write,” says
senior English major Zac Lacy. “I
have noticed this with classmates of
mine who were in the program, and
heard several of them say it them-
selves.”

Senior Kevin Keeley took Hu-
manities and offers a similar opin-
ion, “In retrospect, I would much
rather have taken departmental
courses. I especially didn’t like the
fact that [had no control over which
professor I would have in a given
semester. I also don’t think that
Humanities significantly improved
my writing skills; the assignments
were too few and far between, and
it was easy to get by without putting
much effort into it, which I usually
did,” he says.

Some students are sorry that
they did not participate in the pro-
gram.

“I think Humanities gives a
certain perspective on Western cul-
ture that I am not sure I have been
able to cultivate because I haven’t
taken a class that spans across all
those centuries and all those differ-
ent writers,” says sophomore Jor-
dan deBree.

Current Humanities student
freshman Campbell Goodloe en-
joys the class. “I think that it is the
most important and the most help-
ful of all the classes that I have had
at Davidson;” she says. “Humani-

ties provides you with not only a
broad ‘base upon which to build
your other studies, but it serves as a
timeline on which you can ‘hang’
all of the other course work on.”

If the program changes drasti-
cally, many faculty members feel
that alumni will be upset.

“Many of the alumni were
people in humanities when it was
six days a week and it was this
intensive glorious blitz. It’s not the
same and I think some of us would
like to restore that intensity. that it
used to have. Humanities could be
so much better if we had time to
really sink our teeth into text,” says
Poland.
