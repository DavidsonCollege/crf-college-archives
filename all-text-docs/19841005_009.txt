_ Georgia Tech Heads for Top Of Conference Heap

By STEVE BYERS

Back in August when Georgia
Tech Coach Bill Curry predicted his
Yellow Jackets would win the ACC,
most people just smiled politely and
said no way. Now, heading into the
fourth game of the season, Curry has
led the Jackets to a 3-0 record, includ-
ing wins over Alabama and Clemson.
Tech still has some tough games left,
and it has yet to play away from home,
so the jury is still out.

But come Thanksgiving Georgia
Tech could very well be sitting atop the
conference. And football fans will take
Bill Curry a little more seriously next
August.

Question: How in the world did
Syracuse beat mighty Nebraska last
Saturday? Answer: Nebraska fell vic-
tim to the ol’ Sports Illustrated cover
jinx. (Longhorns Beware!) Question:
If your team’s offense is having

trouble getting untracked, what do you
do? Answer: Hope your team plays
North Carolina soon. Question: What
are two things that are getting old re-
ally fast? Answer: The “Wave” cheer
and ABC’s liberal use of the Super
Slo-Mo replay.

The pro football season is only five
weeks old, and already I’m bored. I
miss Gastineau’s Sack Dance, the
Redskins’ -Fuh Bunch and Butch
Johnson’s California Quake. Bring
back Billy “White Shoes” Johnson.
Allow any and all end zone celebra-
tions. They were always good for a
few fights, and people watch pro foot-
ball to see the spikes and finger point-
ing, anyway.

So far this year, UT-Chattanooga
appears to be the team to beat in the
Southern Conference. The Moccasins
already have big victories over West-
ern Carolina and Furman, the only
other teams expected to challenge for

the title this season.

Elsewhere in college football, it
seems that there has been a changing of
the guard. Alabama is !-3, Pitt is 0-4,
and Auburn and Clemson are 2-2.
Meanwhile, Boston College, Florida
State, and Oklahoma State are all un-
defeated.

And how ’bout this past baseball
season? The Baltimore Orioles, far
and away the best team in 1983,
finished 19 games out this year (al-
though they would have won the A.L.
West). The Milwaukee Brewers,
a.k.a. Harvey’s Wallbangers of a few
years ago, hit the fewest home runs in
the American League.

In the National League the Cubs
and Mets battled it. out for a division
title, while the Pirates finished dead
last in the East, despite having the best
ERA in the majors. That translates as
no hitting.

Yes, this was a wacky year in

4 N

baseball, and some heads have rolled
because of it. Look for seven teams to
have new managers next year. I’m in-
cluding the N.Y. Yankees, of course,
even though George hasn’t fired Yogi
Berra yet. It’s just a matter of time.
Speaking of scapegoats, there was no
bigger one than Joe Torre in Atlanta,
and that’s too bad. What really killed
the Braves this year was injuries and a
bad front-office trade, neither of which
was Torre’s fault.

Returning to the gridiron for a mi-
nute, Monday Night Football had bet-
ter start consistently scheduling some
decent games, or even hard-core fans
like myself will stop watching. Last
year’s St. Louis-N.Y. Giants game
was so bad it was funny, and this
week's Cincinnati-Pittsburgh contest
wasn't exactly memorable. Some of
these matchups may have looked
promising a few years ago, but they are
Strictly yawn ball today.
