their new “Catcave” studio in the Outpost.

Davidson students generally
associate the Outpost with spicy
chicken quesadillas, nachos and
other snacks on Friday and Sat-
urday evenings. Unbeknownst to
many, the Outpost currently houses
two of the average Davidson stu-
dent’s greatest loves: late-night
munchies and the wildly popular
Davidson Show.

The Davidson Show is a weekly
televised comedy show comprised
of student-produced segments and
previews for upcoming campus

_ events.

The show had humble begin-
nings, as it was originally mostly
shot in a dorm room, but it has re-
cently moved to an exciting new
venue. Now in its third season, the
Davidson Show operates out of a
newly renovated studio located in
the Outpost basement. Although

the Union Board funds the show,
the new space was made financially
possible through proposals made to
President Tom Ross and the Activ-
ity Tax Council (ATC). The new
studio renders the show’s previous
introduction, “from the dorm room
of one Davidson College student,”
obsolete.

Rumors have buzzed around

Women who learn together, lead together:
First annual women’s leadership conference

Krista TIMEUS
Staff Writer

In order to help create a net-
work of women professionals and
leaders, Davidson is hosting its first
annual Women’s Leadership Con-
ference on Feb. 20 and 21.

According to Alex McArthur
“09, one of the conference planning

committee chairs, the first Annual

Women’s Leadership Conference
aims to cultivate a culture of strong
female leadership at Davidson Col-
lege and in our community through

. the exploration of a wide range of

strategies for effective leadership
and the development of a female
leadership network.

“We have been amazed at the
outpouring of excitement and sup-
port from both Davidson College
and the surrounding Davidson
community,” McArthur said. “Al-
though this is our first year, we
hope that this conference will be-
come a Davidson tradition.”

Hoping to approach the topic
from varying angles, the confer-
ence will consist of several events
throughout the weekend, including
a “Cross-Generational Dialogue”
between the 50 female student
leaders and the 50 female com-
munity leaders participating in the
day’s activities.

Additionally, two keynote
speakers will share their experi-
ences and lessons learned with the
community. Friday night will kick
off the event with a dinner and
Keynote speaker, Shannon McFad-
den ’82, a Davidson Alum and for-
mer Vice President of Human Re-
sources for Wachovia. Saturday’s
speaker, Lynn Hennighausen, will
offer her thoughts on how to bal-
ance a profession with other aspects
of life, such as family, a challenge
many women face when making
career choices:

The event won’t be all lecture,
no play, though. There will be plen-
ty opportunities for participating

students and community leaders to
interact with each other.

The “Stimulating , Breakout
Sessions,” a form of workshop,
will assist attendees in developing
self-exploration and skill-building
habits. Another goal of these ac-
tivities is for students and profes-
sionals to network. The idea is that
establishing contacts and knowing
prominent female leaders in vari-
ous fields can compel students to

pursue ambitious career and lead-.

ership paths.

The Women’s Leadership
Conference is part of the Chidsey
Leadership Development program,
whose mission is to “cultivate op-
portunities for Davidson students...
so that they may be effective lead-
ers in any group or setting in which
they find themselves.” Next week-
end, women in Davidson and the
community can get closer to be-
coming those effective leaders.

. “The goal is to make sure ev-
ery first year student has a bed,”
Associate Dean of Students and
Director of Residence Life Patty
Perillo said. Although this goal
may seem simple enough, after
receiving an over 20 percent in-
crease in Early Decision applica-
tions from last year, the Admis-
sions office predicts an even larg-
er first year class than this year’s
482 students.

The Admissions Office has re-
ceived 4,472 applications at this
point, which is an all-time high
and a 1.3 percent increase from
last year. Taking these figures
into account, next year’s incom-
ing class could contain upwards
of 490 students. This means that
RLO needs to devise a plan to
create room for eight more beds.

At a larger institution finding
space for eight beds may seem
trivial, however, at a school like
Davidson, with only 1,700 stu-
dents and a limited amount of
housing space, this addition poses
a logistical feat. RLO and the ad-
missions office have recognized
this predicament and are already
dealing with the issue.

Dean Perillo stated that ear-
lier this semester she sent out an
email to RLO, SGA and the stu-
dent advisory board asking for
any recommendations for cre-
ating new viable living spaces.
Many suggestions were voiced,
such as switching the recently
renovated Richardson Hall to an
upperclassmen dorm, but RLO is
not considering this option. Dean
Perillo stated, “Richardson has
always been a first year hall, and
we feel it is important to keep this
tradition,”

Two solutions have emerged
as the most feasible options: one
is to convert Cannon, which was
turned into a first year hall, back
to an upperclassmen residence
hall, and then to switch Little to a
first year residence hall. The sec-
ond option is to rearrange which
floors of Belk will house first-year
students, since certain levels have
potential to hold a greater number
of beds, house upperclassmen and
first year students,

A definite decision on this
issue will be made in a meeting
next week, with the overall goal
in mind, “to maintain integrity of
living space for both first years
