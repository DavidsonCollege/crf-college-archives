RAPE Draws Suggestions
For Campus Safeguards

By TOM SCHILLING

The RAPE Committee, in
cooperation with the SGA, has
tabulated the results of their re-
cently-distributed campus-wide
security survey. The results indi-
cate that although most students
felt relatively safe at Davidson,
many want to see some security
improvements, particularly in pat-
rolling procedure, outdoor light-
ing and emergency phone avail-
ability.

RAPE Committee Chairper-
son Melissa McLemore, along
with Dean of Students Will Terry
and Chief of Security Jackie
Hughes, met with Facilities Plan-
ning Director Grover Meetze mid-
way through the term to discuss
the issue. Their opinions differed
widely, according to McLemore,
so they agreed to a survey. “We
wanted to see what students
wanted,” McLemore said.

SGA Senators distributed the

surveys. Questions — included:
“How effective do you feel our
present security is? Would you
like to see increased patrolling?
Where? Gauge the effectiveness
of the dorm locking system?” and
several others.

The largest responses came
from freshmen and from women.
“Of all responses 67 percent were
female and 87 percent were from
dorm residents.” Although many
students were unsure of their opin-
ions a majority agreed that more
patrolling and lighting was a good
idea. Areas considered particu-
larly unsafe included the new
parking lots, the stadium and
track, the wooded area behind the
Commons and all of Patterson
Court.

McLemore added: “All these
proposals are still Band-Aids in
my opinion. We really need
changes in attitudes.” She felt that
patrolmen needed to get to know
students and to cover more than

just dorm lounges and central
walkways in their rounds. “I want
patrolling in study areas like
DCPC and Phi Hall.” In addition,
she emphasized the need for
police escorts at night.

One suggestion was golf carts
or similar open vehicles to replace
the Cushman carts presently used.
The officer could hear better and
could see more as well. McLe-
more pointed out that “If you were
stealing a bicycle you could hear a
Cushman a mile away.” She
added that perhaps the new open
vehicles could make less noise.

On the whole Davidson's se-
curity system was judged favor-
ably by the students. Within the
past year, at least, criminal inci-
dents or other events warranting
intervention by security were rare.
However, a few occurred. In the
results of this recent survey many
students, particularly women,
merely requested some small im-
provements.

N: C: Fellows Program To Undergo Revamping

By DAVID VAN PELT

The Davidson N.C. Fellows
Program needs revamping. That is
the consensus of a group of N.C.
Fellows and program administra-
tors who are currently reexamin-
ing and changing the program. |

“| think the feeling among stu-
dents selected to be N.C. Fellows
is that they didn’t know why they
were there and what their purpose
is,” said Harriet Root, Assistant
Director of the Careers Office and
program director of the N.C. Fel-
low Program. Root said current
N.C. Fellows thought the pro-
gram did not meet their expecta-
tions when they joined the pro-
gram. Each year, the program, es-
tablished in 1967, chooses eight to
ten members of the sophomore
class judged to have leadership
potential and seeks to develop that
potential through leadership
workshops, seminars with com-
munity leaders, and interaction
with N.C. Fellows on other col-
lege campuses, according to an
N.C. Fellows brochure.

Root said four Davidson Fel-
lows becan:2 interested in re-
vamping the Davidson program
after they attended the Center for
Creative Leadership in
Greensboro during Christmas va-
cation, an activity funded by N.C.
Fellows. Juniors Sara Beasley,
Edward Hay, Allen Mast, and
Beadsie Woo attended the Center
this year, according to Root, and
received input on how to add more
direction and activities to the pro-
gram. The four students have
found a Fellows core group com-

posed of about five members
which meets weekly to consider
changes in the program and dis-
cuss issues concerning the group.
According to Woo, the four
students who attended the Center
were able to see the Davidson
N.C. Fellows program in com-
parison to Fellows programs at the
University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill, North Carolina State,
and North Carolina A&T. Woo
said the other North Carolina Fel-
lows programs are generally more
“viable, active groups on their
campuses.” At Davidson, she
said, “no one has ever known
what is expected of them.” Woo
said it is important to establish
concrete guidelines to inform Fel-
lows of their responsibilities with-
in the group. “We do want people
to take it [the Fellows] seriously.
That has been a problem.”
According to Hay, “I really
didn't feel like I was getting much
of the program. It felt like a re-
sume stuffer.” Hay said the group
has rarely acted upon the optimis-

tic plans outlined by the group
each year during its autumn re-
treat. “But the potential for the
Fellows is tremendous, he said.

Hay said since Christmas the
Fellows have formed six commit-
tees to deal with important con-
cerns within the group. The ac-
countability committee, he said,
addresses “the very core of our
problem.” This committee con-
siders the degree to which Fellows
should be responsible for group
activities and community service.
Root said many of the eight Fel-
lows’ faculty advisors as well as
Fellows themselves have
pressed concern about whether the
group should be required to “give
something back” in return for the
benefits Fellows receive. Fellows
can receive aid and financial reim-
bursement for internships, dinners
and luncheons, and meetings with
community business leaders. “We
want members to feel they have a
responsibility to Fellows.” he
said.

Hay said two committees deal

ex-

with planning activities for next
fall, winter and spring. The com-
mittees, he said, wish to organize
a concrete list of activities for next
fall and more speculative schedule
for winter and spring.

The Fellows mentor system,
according to Hay “has been some-
thing that hasn’t worked very well
in the past.” Under this aspect of
the Fellows program, eight facul-
ty and administrative officials
form personal relationships with
individual Fellows. A mentors’
committee will consider changes
in this program.

Another committee addresses
the Fellows selection system. The
current selection system is based
upon an application form and
essay which narrows the field to
16 to 20 applicants, and the inter-
view teams consisting of Fellows,
faculty members, and community
leaders which makes the final
selection. The committee 1s exa-
mining the viability of this sys-
tem, Root said, and planning to
alter the Fellows brochure sent to
freshmen the summer before their
sophomore year, describing the
program.

By creating a more definite list
of responsibilities for Fellows in
the brochure, according to Woo,
new Fellows will more aware
about Fellows activities. “If we
can communicate to freshmen,
this will be more enthusiastic
within the group,” she said.

According to Root, the Fel-
lows have conducted several ac-
tivities since Christmas to tn-
crease unity in the group. She said
Fellows have used the Initiatives

Course behind Erwin Lodge, an
obstacle course requiring group
participation. Fellows have also
made video tapes of hypothetical
problem solving sessions among
groups of Fellows.

Dean of Students Will Terry.
co-chairman of the program direc-
tors, praised the changes being
made in the Fellows program. He
said he hoped they would result in
“more formal, actual training” for
Fellows. “The impetus [for pro-
gram changes] came from the stu-
dents themselves, which ts
exactly where it should come
from.”

Though Root said most Fel-
lows’ mentors desire at least some
changes in the Fellows program,
there remains a “disparity of opin-
ion” about how extensive those
changes should be.

Sophomore Fellow Stephen
Harrison disagreed with the no
tion that Fellows should be re-
quired to “put something back”
into the community as part of the
program. “Presumably. we were
chosen because we're already put
ting something in.” he said

According to) Harrison. the
constraints cause him to miss Fel-
low programs rather than lack of
interest.” Certainly the things |
have not gone to have not been be-
cause I didn’t believe in them.”
but because [ didn't have the
time.” He said he thought the pro-
gram changes are “headed in the
right direction,” but he thnks the
primary purpose of the Fellows
should be as a “support group” to
stimulate new ideas among mem
