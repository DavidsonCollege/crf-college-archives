VOL. LII

THREE PROPOSALS

A P Underachievement
Await Faculty Meeting

The faculty will act on three proposals which would alter year-end requirements,
academic probation, and the underachievement program at its next meeting early in

May.

The proposed changes were
presented at the April 14 facul-
ty meeting. Action was delayed,
however, to enable faculty
members to study the six-page
report thoroughly.

Underachievement is dealt
with in detail in the report,
which suggests that the current
method of selecting wunder-
achievers be altered. A tenta-
tive list of underachievers
would be composed of those
students whose averages are
more than .50 below their pre-
dicted averages.

Also included on this tentative
list would be the names of stud-
ents whom faculty members
consider to be underachievers
on the “basis of their course
work during the preceding se-
mester.”’

The tentative list would then
be sent to members of the
faculty who either taught or
were faculty advisers to any
of the listed students during
the preceding semester.

The individual professor
would be asked to state in writ-
ing ‘“‘whether or not he recom
mends the awarding of the un-
derachiever classification to
any of the tentative under
achievers about whom he has
special personal knowledge.’’

The members of the faculty
would also be asked to furnish
additional information on the
students involved.

Working with the information

Minimum semester hours a!

into the succeeding class:

collected, the Dean of Students
would compile a final under-
achiever list and notify the
students selected and their par
ents. The dean would then ar-
range for the individual coun-
seling of each underachiever.

Should all other efforts fail.
the dean would refer the stud-
ent to the Executive Committee
of the Faculty which may re-
quire the student to withdraw
from the College for ‘‘not mak-
ing a serious effort to do an
acceptable quantity and quality
of work."’

Members of the committee
declined to comment on the pro
posal until after the next facul-
ty meeting. The committee in-
cludes Dr. Richard Bernard as
chairman, Dr. J. H. Ostwalt,
Dean of Students Richard C.

Burts, Dr. Max Polley, Dr.
Paul Marrotte, and Dr. J. M.
Frederickson.

The committee report also
recommends altering the
year-end requirements for en-
trance into each class. (See
chart). Requirements for
graduation—124 hours, 124
quality points—would remain
unchanged.

Under the proposed require
ments, students having ‘‘senior"’
status would need no more than
33 hours and quality points for
graduation. Currently, it is pos
sible for students to enter the
year and still lack 39

Forum’s Final Topic:
Lefever Talks Politics

Dr. Ernest Lefever, Economic and Political Advisor
to the United States government, closes out the YMCA’s
Forums on Challenges to the Christian Faith this coming

Thursday, April 30.

Engineered by Bill Ferris
and Jay Federman, the Forums
have brought Morgenau, Scriv-
en, Gary, Barchilon, the Coles,
Mueller, and, seventh and last,
Lefever.

Lefever at present is staff

member of the International
Studies Division of the Institute

DR. ERNEST LEFEVER

U. S. Government consultant

for Defense Analyses, professor
of international politics at Amer-

ican University, consultant to
the Council on Religion and In-
ternational Affairs, and lectur-
er at the Foreign Service Insti-
tute.

Lefever received his AB from
Elizabethtown College and his
BD and PhD from Yale.

The first three years after
World War II he spent working
among returning German pris-
oners of war, then later trav-
eled in the Soviet Union, Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary; and
East Germany.

In 1962 he worked through the
Congo, Southern Rhodesia, Ken-
ya, Egypt, the Gaza Strip, Pak-

hours and 43 quality points to-
ward graduation.

Suggested too is a lightened
work load for freshmen. A nor-
mal schedule for freshmen
would be 12 or 13 hours exclu-
sive of basic ROTC. However,
a freshman would be permitted
to take additional courses with
the permission of his faculty
adviser and the Dean of Stud-
ents.

Academic probation in the
Proposed program would be
replaced by an academic
warning. Following each
grade report, any student who
failed to make 12 hours and
12 quality points would be
notified in writing by the Dean
of Students.

The letter, in addition to stat-
ing that the student's work is
unsatisfactory, would also di-
rect the student to the Dean's
office immediately, ‘‘for coun-
seling and for such additional
action as may be considered
advisable for the improvement
of his academic standing.”

At the present. any student
placed on academic. probation
automatically loses his cuts.
Under: the proposed system, this
penalty could still be meted out
by the Dean of Students, but
only if he deemed it necessary
after counseling.

The committee's report sug-
gests that special academic
probation be called ‘‘academic
probation."’ The basic require-
ment would remain the same:
the unsatisfactory student would
have to complete his year-end
requirements during summer
school at Davidson in order to
re-enter the College in Septem-
ber.

Former Dean Back
For ODK Tapping

Dr. Samuel Spencer, presi
dent of Mary Baldwin College,
and former dean of students at
Davidson College, will speak at
assembly, Monday, April 27 for
the Omicorn Delta Kappa tap-
ping ceremony.

Dr. Spencer, himself an alum-
nus of Davidson (Class of 1940),
was a member of ODK, Phi
Beta Kappa, and Kappa Alpha.

In 1941 he returned to David-
son with the Military Science
Department; however, with the
advent of World War II, he took
an active part as a member of
the Officer Corps.

With the war's end, Dr. Spen-
cer again returned to Davidson,
this time as a professor of his-
tory. After only a brief time,
he accepted the office of Dean
of Students,
hold for seven years until he ac-
cepted the presidency of Mary
Baldwin.

Local Agnostic - Architect

Speaks Before Humanists

BY TOM LOFLIN

Bill Ferris’ informal Hu-
manist group became a liv-
ing reality last Thursday
night in the Green Room of
the Union. When Howard
Olive, an architect from
Charlotte, got up and spoke
about what his agnostic-
Humanist faith meant for
him, the group moved ac-
tively into the theater of
campus life.

During the session a total of
twenty people shifted in and
out of the room to hear the man
who supervised construction of
the Dana Science Building. The
parents of a Davidson senior
were among those present.

“I think it’s very admirable,”
Olive. began, ‘that Davidson
College has allowed its students
to explore, publicly, some of the
ideas that are in direct conflict
to its faith. As long as Dr. D. G.
Martin will stand up and lead
as he has done, I think all will
admire him."’ (Olive was pres-
ent at the specific invitation of
Ferris and not at the request of
the college.)

Olive said that the American
Humanist Association did not
require its members to be non-
believers in God. ‘But the asso-
ciation considers itself a relig-
ious organization,” he added,
“It regards Humanism as a
higher religious movement, the
next step forward for man in re-
ligion.”’

Olive conceded that it would
be very hard for a Christian or
atheist to be a true Humanist.
“The association says there is
not vertical intervention from

a Supreme Being

“I am not saying there is no

Supreme Being,” he went on,
“but I have found no evidence
to believe there is. Yet there is

something which pushes me. to
move in some direction toward
bettering humanity, I have a

drive I. can’t explain to move
and not ‘stand still."
Olive defined Humanism,

for him at least, as being the
desire to improve humanity on
earth without relying on any
outside intervention.

After the formal talk, the par
ents approached Olive. The
woman asked almost fearfully,
with a look of horror on her
fac», “What is your feeling
about the after-life?’’ Olive re-
plied that he really wasn't ex-
pecting to find any.

“I admit,’ he chuckled, “if
I'm wrong and the Christians
are right that I'll be up the
creek.’ He added that he had
talked to a good many minis-

The Red Cross Bloodmobile

Monday and Tuesday for the

ROTC Department's semi-an-
nual blood drive.

Cadets who donate blood

it established last year when

blood than students at any
other college in this area.

“The World Crisis and Amer-
ican Responsibility’, his Thurs-
day morning chapel theme, will
be an attempt to relate political
analysis and ethical norms. But
not in abstract terms: as he
says: ‘I propose to deal primar-
ily with the nature of the secur-
ity dilemma and the necessity
for arms control."

Faculty Hears Clyde

Dr. Paul Clyde of the Duke
Endowment Fund will speak to
the Davidson chapter of the
American Association of Uni-
versity Professors in a dinner

rison Room of the College Union

ed the meeting as one of a se-

ries of programs designed to;

‘give the faculty an opportunity
to look at the broader functions
of the college.”

In two previous programs this
year, President Martin has dis-
cussed the Ten-Year Program)
at Davidson, and a panel of
faculty members has discussed
the role of the faculty members
in the life of the college. ;

Spring Blooms, Booms
As Frolickers Set Pace

Aiming for Spring Frolics as the most attraction-
packed weekend blast of the year, the Interfraternity
Council has lined up a volley of two double-barrelled
concerts for tonight and tomorrow.

In response to a poll taken
last fall, the IFC will expend
an estimated six thousand green
backs to lure almost 500 girls
to Davidson's campus for the
annual weekend of frolicking.
Expenditures will go toward two
concerts, the first beginning to
night at 7.

Joe and Eddie, the Serendip-
ity Singers, and Fred Smoot
will be in Chambers tonight
for a two-intermission, three-
hour concert. Smoot, a comic
who boasts a number of per-
formances in nightclubs and
Yankee colleges, will emcee.

Twelve-string guitar fantasies,
dramatic blackouts, and com
edy sketches are stock-in-trade
for the Serendipity Singers, key-
noted by a blend of ‘‘extraordi-
nary sound en masse."’ It all
adds up to Folk Jazz, folk ori
entation coupled with jazz in
strumentation and arrange
ments.

Rounding out the program,
Joe Gilbert, who hails from old
New Orleans, and Eddie Brown,
a native of Norfolk, will dem
onstrate their specialty of rapid
fire folk song delivery.

The duo has sung its way
from San Francisco's hungry
i and Purple Onion to New
York’s Blue Angel, and fea-
tures versatility that ranges
from backwoods to Bach.

Council Reaffirms
lis Stand On Tougaloo

BY JOHN BAILEY
The Student Council, by a 9-2 vote Monday night, re-
affirmed its decision to mail a resolution supporting
Tougaloo College in its dispute with Mississippi State

officials.

The letter is in answer to an sumed by the United States in

appeal from Tougaloo College
(a predominantly Negro school)
for help in maintaining its char-
ter, which is being jeopardized
by the governement of Missis
sippi.

The Council's letter opens with
the words “We, the Student
Council of Davidson College”
and justifies its actions by con-
tinuing with ‘‘our appeal is in
the name of education and of
academic freedom.”

Charlie Marshall's motion not
to send the letter was defeated,
and the Council thereby rati
fied its previous position to mail
the letter.

Andy Little reported on the
compilation of a summer read
ing list. The council has asked
various professors to submit a
suggested summer reading pro
gram for interested students.

The information will be com-
piled by Little’s committee,
mimeographed, and made avail
able to the student body prior
to the end of the school year.

Council President Will Jack
son made three appointments to
jobs for the coming school year
Arnie Snider was appointed to
the Student Activities Commit
tee: Johnny Gresham was plac
ed on the Magazine Advisory
Report Committee (dealing
with budgeting of publications),
and Tom Frist was given the
job of Gunroom Manager.

Having just returned from the
NSA Regional Convention of
the past weekend, Fred Sack
ett was enthusiastic over the
resolutions adopted by the con-
vention. In his report to the
Council he emphasized the im-
portance of the resolution which
would keep NSA from taking a
pro or con stand on positions as-

regard to the world situation.

Sackett also stated that com
plete copies of the convention's
resolutions would be distributed
to the student body.

The Council also established
its policy for the coming year
on absences at student govern-
ment meetings. President Jack
son. expressed his disapproval
of the large number of absences
in the past, and it was decided
to have no excused absences
with the exception of extreme
cases.

lie Ramberg participated in the
program. Dibble served as a re-
porter for The News and Courier
of Charleston, S, C., while Ram-
berg held a similar position on
The Savannah Morning News.

The program was initiated sev-
eral years ago to encourage stu-
dents in liberal arts colleges to
make a career of journalism. It
is aimed primarily at those stu-
dents who have had no oppor-
tunity to work on 4 newspaper
or to study journalism.

After being accepted by the
Newspaper Fund the student
must apply for position on one
of the newspapers participating
in the program.

Mr. J. M. Tubb

Supt. of Public Education
Capitol Building
Jackson, Mississippi
Dear Sir:

We, the Student Council of Davidson College,
are appealing to you to exert your influence in any

2

way possible to see that Mississippi Senate Bill 1672

does not become law.
The revocation of a

charter to an accredited

center of education would serve as a dimming of the
light of learning that would be felt not only in
Mississippi, but also in many other parts of our na-

tion.

Our appeal is in the name of education and of
academic freedom, for the right to an education
must prevail over all boundaries of racial unrest,

whether on a local, state

or national level.

We realize ‘that our relation’ to this problem
may seem a superficial one, and yet we also realize
that we, as American college students, have a dis-
tinct interest and concern in such a situation.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
The Davidson College
Student Council
