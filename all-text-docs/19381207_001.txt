“Y” States Plans

“Y” Cabinet To Use

No High

In Collecting Fund

Principle of The Spirit of The
Gift Will Be Used This Year

TORREY EXPLAINS PLAN

Boxes Will Be Placed To
Receive Donations

Archer Torrey stated last
Monday in a brief chapel talk
that the YMCA Cabinet would
not use any high pressure me-
thods to obtain the goal for the
Christmas Gift fund which is
to go to the Biederwolf Leper
Colony in Korea this year.

According to Torrey, who was
speaking for the “Y” Cabinet, there
will be no pledge cards and no can-
vassing of dormitories this year,
since the Cabinet has decided that
no one should make a contribution
who feels that it is being forced
upon him. “The gift does not
count so much as the spirit with
which you give it,” said Torrey.
“The “Y” Cabinet not want
to embarrass anyone about the
question of donating money to the
Gift fund.”

Goal of Eight Hundred

Boxes are being placed at strat-
egic points on the campus and any
student wishing .to donate any
amount of money may drop his
contribution into ‘one of these
boxes. The goal has been set at
eight. hundred dollars and they hope
that the new method of handling
contributions will be more success-
ful than that of pledge cards and
dormitory canvassing. The Cabinet
has made Faith the theme and they
are stressing to the student body
the point of faith in giving.

The publicity campaign for this
project will be carried on in an
educational manner. Lectures, chap-
el“talks, feature stories in the
Davidsonian and illustrated slides
will be the main points in the cam-
paign.

does

Boxes Closed on 15th

The boxes will be closed Decem-
ber 15th and the sum announced
the next day. This will be a change
since contributions have been al-
lowed to run over into February in
past years. If some boy finds it
impossible to make a contribution
before Christmas the Cabinet will
accept the gift after Christmas, but
the real campaign closes December

15th.

Spanish Frat Meets

Al Bixler presided at the regular
meeting of Sigma Delta Pi, honor-
ary Spanish fraternity, which was
held last Monday night in the
Quardrangler’s room.

The program began with a dialo-
gue between Bill Loftin and Elmer
Hulen entitled “La Clase de Gram-
atica.” This was followed by an-
other dialogue between Roy Cunn-
ingham and Marshall Houston.
Their part was named “A La Luz

de La Luna.” Fred Harbin then
reviewed a Spanish novel.
A motion was made by Prof.

Fleagle that since no member of
the Davidson faculty could be pre-
sent at the modern language meet-
ing in San Francisco, the head of

Members of Chemistry Group
To Present Interesting
Experiments

Gamma Sigma Epsilon,
honorary chemistry fraternity,
will hold its regular semester
open meeting tonight at 8
o'clock in the chemistry build-
ing. This meeting should be
of interest not only to those
taking chemistry but to others
as well. The meeting will be

presided over by President
Locke White.
The program will consist of a

number of interesting and spectacu-
lar experiments performed by some
members of the society. The mem-
bers and their experiments are as
follows:

Tom Mullen will perform
periments on air pressure and the
explosion of a mixture of hydro-
gen and chlorine. Bob Doty will
show the formation of solid alcho-
hol and crystals.

Beecher Sitterson will prove the

show how molten iron can be
taken from thermite. Vance Myets
will perform an experiment on

burning phosphorus.

Dr. S. B. Knight, chemistry pro-
fessor, will climax the program by
preparing fluorescein and showing
its oxidation to mercurochrome.

Just preceding the open meeting,
the society members will elect from
their group one who is considered
the most outstanding to become an
automatic member of the American
Chemical Society. The student
elected will very probably attend
the annual meeting of this national
honorary society next spring.

Dr. Hood Leads. Sund ay School

Dr. Frazer Hood led the Sunday
school service in the Phi Hall last
Sunday morning. His subject was
on the three temptations of Christ.
He took his text from the fourth
chapter of Matthew: 1-11.

Dr. Hood compared the tempta-
tions of Christ with that of our first
ancestors, Adam and Eve. There
are three types of temptations:
temptation through our senses,
temptation through our imagina-
tion and temptation through our
reason, Christ was tempted in each
of these points. Christ was tempt-
ed to make a wrong use of his
power and change the stones into
bread. Our. first ancestors were
also tempted through their senses
and to eat the fruit of the tree.
Christ was tempted by his immagi-
nation to throw himself off the

temple. In the same way our early
ancestors were tempted through
the thought of becoming Gods if
they ate of the tree. Christ was
tempted through his reasoning to
doubt his heavenly Father and wor-
ship the devil. Adam and Eve were
also tempted to doubt whether God
spoke the truth when He said they
should die if they ate the fruit.

It is interesting to see how Christ
answered all these temptations. He
quoted scripture: “Thou shalt not
eat of bread alone,” in answer to
the first temptation; “Thou shalt
not tempt the Lord thy God,” in
answer to the second one; and
“Thou shalt worship the Lord thy
God and him only shalt thou serve.”
The way in which Christ answered
his temptations should be a practi-
cal help for us today.
