Faculty : and students react to semester proposal

sal states that the EPC “hopes that
its proposal will receive the widest
possible scrutiny and comment,
since only an open process of dis-
‘cussion and debaté will bring
about the changes we believe will
improve the already excellent
academic program of Davidson
College.” As such, faculty and
students alike have already begun
‘informally discussing the advan-
tages and disadvantages of the

proposed calendar switch.
At present, some faculty

members favor the early semester

Williams said a semester sys-
tem at Davidson would bring the
college calendar into greater con-
sistency with the calendars of
other institutions. Under such a
system, he said, it would be easier
for Davidson to host visiting fac-
ulty members and to send students

more classes (under the semester
system), but still the student gets a
charice to come to class and reflect
on that particular material over a
day before he or she comes back to
the next class.”

Anthropology and Sociology
Department Chairman ~ Grant
Jones expressed a similar view.
“What I find the major disadvan-
tage of the trimester system is that
there is not enough time,” he said.
“Ten weeks is over before it starts,
and then you have to pick up and
course loads, by providing
courses of different levels of in-
tensity, and by encouraging ad-
vanced independent work in the
junior and senior years.

The faculty will begin for-
mally discussing and debating the
EPC proposal next week. Ap-
proval of the proposal would tech-
nically require a simple majority
of the faculty, but History Profes-
sor Malcolm Partin noted that the
EPC “does not believe it wise to
implement the plan without a full
majority.” EPC committee mem-
bers have proposed implementa-
tion of the semester calendar by,

tum around and do it all over

three times, to have to begin the
term over three times, is exhaust-
ing.” Under the semester system,
he said, “there is more time for in-
dividual student work, which
tends to push people towards more
independent initiatives and pro-
vides a more flexible schedule.”

But other members of the fac-
ulty have expressed reservations
about. semesters. Chemistry De-
partment Chairman Roger Nutt
said current laboratory facilities in
sciences such as chemistry cannot
accomodate the increases in the
sizes of science classes “that
would result under the semester
system. Nutt added that a “major
disadvantage” of the semester sys-
tem is that a student interested in
premedicine, or science will have
“much less flexibility” in terms of
when he or she begins taking sci-
ence courses. “Down the road,”
Nutt said, “what that means is that
Davidson will be less attractive
for individuals interested in sci-
ence or premedicine.”

Art Department Chairman
“Herb Jackson, who was a David-

son student at the time the college
first decided to implement a three-
term system, said the EPC propo-
sal would eliminate the “flexibil-
ity ‘and focus” that the current

three-term system was s designed to

now are so far less “pressed” than
they were when they were on the
semester system.”

Jackson has submitted to the
EPC an alternative proposal
which he says would preserve the
current three-term system but
would provide additional flexibil-

ity in scheduling. Jackson’s pro-.

posal calls for blocks of time to be
scheduled where certain classes
could meet twice a week on Mon-
day and Wednesday or Tuesday
and Thursday for two hours.
Other, more intensive classes
could maintain the current five
meetings per week.

Students, as well, have ex-
pressed differing opinions about
the proposed calendar switch.
Sophomore Susan, Park favors a
semester calendar because she
says they would give students
more “percolation time” to think
and reflect on the material covered
in each of their courses. Park said,
“I definitely think that material
you have retained over fifteen

weeks might last longer than

something that has been crammed
in ten weeks.” Junior Charles
Tambiah said he believes a semes-
ter system “would give much
more room for students to self-ful-
fill their interests.” He said that

Kazee wins Washington fellowship

a

By TOM MOORE

Tom Kazee changes jobs next
year, and he’s-looking forward to
a year of responsibility and chal-
lenge. “They may have me take
out the trash, though,” the David-
son political science professor
laughed.

Kazee is a winner of the
American Political Science As-
sociation’s 1987-88 Fellowship
program. He and the other fellows
depart to Washington, D.C. in
November and, after a month-
long orientation period, will work
full time in congressional offices
for nine months.

“We'll be the same as any full
time staffers; we'll draft legisla-
tion and do legislative research,
probably more of the latter,” for
political scientist types, he said. A
wide variety of professions are
represented in the fellowship pro-

“Let us be your connection to great Pizza!”

gram, from journalists to political
scientists to doctors.

After the orientation period,
fellows will be able to arrange
which congressional office they
would like to work for. “One re-
quirement is that we can’t
negotiate with any office” before
the program commences, so that
everyone has an equal chance,
Kazee said. Fellows switch to an
‘office in the opposite chamber of
Congress after four and a half
months.

Though he can’t make any
commitments, Kazee expressed
an interest in working with Geo-
rgia senator Wyche Fowler, who
was elected in 1986 in an upset

‘victory over Mack Mattingly.

“We're ideologically compatible,
and he has lots of House (of Rep-
resentatives) experience,” Kazee
explained. “He’s from a state like
North Carolina, and he’s also a

Dayidson alumnus.”

Kazee was drawn to the pro-
gram by its track record. “It was
the most compatible with my in-
terests of all the fellowship pro-
grams, and I have been very im-
pressed with the quality of the fel-
lows,” hes said. The American
Political Science Association has
sponsored the program since
1953, and 1,218 have previously
Participated.

“Much of the good research
being done today in political sci-
ence is by former fellows, which
reflects the quality of the experi-

ence of the participants . . . . The
program is recognized for qual-
ity.”

Kazee’s Washington experi-
ence is not limited to the nine-to-
five workday. Weekly seminars
will be held, addressed by promi-
nent politicians or public figures.

This should be “the most pure
profit, the most pure enjoyment”
of the fellowship, he said.

The opportunity comes along
“at an excellent time, purely coin-
cidental,” Kazee says. He was due
for a sabbatical anyway, and the
1987-88 political season is an
election year. “Not only that, buta
Presidential election year,” he
noted.

“If you have lawmaking inter-
ests, it’s not such a good year, be-
cause Congress is less in session,”
and less gets done on Capito! Hill.
However, “’My work is electoral,
and this is going to be an open,
competitive election. It should be
very exciting,” he said, and the
August end of his fellowship al-
lows him to work through both
parties’ conventions.

Although one of his wife’s
friends has told him that when he

class, “they would have an oppor-
tunity to do outside reading,
which is not available now.”

Sophomore Jay Townshend
also favors a semester calendar,
because “having classes every day
can be too demanding for students
in college.” Townshend said, “I
just think having a day off, or hav-
ing a variety of schedule, just ap-
peals to me more than just having
the same, hum-drum three classes
in a row.”

. But Junior Chris Duke said he
would favor retention of the cur-
rent three-term ‘calendar. “The
trimester system is one of the
things that sets Davidson apart”
from other institutions, Duke
said. “It does .make things a bit
easier because you only have three
classes a day, and you only have
three classes a term. The pace is
fast and furious, but you learn a
lot, and you learn to keep up.”

Freshman Shannon O’ Shields
said she would also favor the re-
tention of the three-term calendar.

“*T don’t like the fifteen week

terms” proposed under the semes-
ter calendar, O’Shields said. “I
tend to burn out after about ten
weeks. And I like the fact that we .
only have three classes now so
that we’re not overloaded with too
much stuff.”

discounted the seductiveness of
the capital. “Washington is real
exciting, but it would take a lot to
push me,” he said. “I don’t see
myself doing any thing else. My
best guess is that in twenty years,
I'll be here” at Davidson.

Kazee’s position at Davidson
will be filled by a visiting profes-
sor. Already, fifteen applications
have arrived for the job, and invi-
tations for merviewgol be is-
sued soon. The visiting professor
will teach-two classes per term, in-
cluding one seminar in his or her
specialty.

A major concem for Kazee
and the rest of the political science
department is finding a replace-
ment who can also fill his shoes on
the volleyball court. The team is
looking for a hitter.
