There was revenge in the chlo-
rinated air on Saturday, as the
swimming and diving teams battled
defending Southern States cham-
pion Georgia Southern and power-
ful Eastern Carolina at Cannon
pool.

When the steam had cleared,
both the men (133-103) and women
(142-90) had trounced the rival
Eagles, but fallen to the Pirates
(141-98, men; 142-94, women).

Coach Rich DeSelm was
pleased with the team’s perfor-
mance.

“Tt was just a great team win
(over GSU). Everybody contrib-
uted in their own way from swim-
ming fast, to racing smart, to sup-

porting each other. It takes all of

that to win a championship,” he
said. “It feels good to be a little
more competitive with ECU and to
beat GSU. If that’s not motivating
for the team, then I don’t know
what is.”

Kathleen Paffenroth got a
break from her iron-woman triple,
swimming the 200 IM (fifth,
2:15.67), the 200 fly (second,
2:12.03), and the 3rd leg of the 400
medley relay (1st, 4:06.69), which
was .8 seconds from a school
record. :

- Filling in for Paffenroth in the
1000 free, Zannah Bozzone
grabbed fourth (10:51.54) and
Tonya Werner sixth (11:13.68). In
the 500 free, Mary Shell Brosche
took second (5:11.34), Werner sev-
enth (5:34.21), and Lynsay Madley
eighth (5:43.03). Jenny Hillman,
who also swam the triple on occa-
sion this season, had to miss the
meet with shoulder problems. She
expects to be back in two weeks.

Brosche also grabbed second
in the 200 free (1:56.44) where she
was barely out-touched by ECU’s
Hollie Butler (1:56.37), she an-
chored the winning 400 medley
relay, and swam the second leg of
the third-place 400 free relay
(4:01.37). ;

Cowan started all 40 games of his Davidson career and Ferguson broke the school’s rookie rushing

record, as the Wildcats posted their first winning season (6-4) in thee years.

Swimmers dunk Eagles, make early season statement

her,” DeSelm said about Brosche.
“She’s a real racer.”

Bozzone also performed well
in other events, capturing the 200
back (2:10.76), and anchoring the
winning 400 free relay (3:45.35).
But, after the 1000 free, it was
unclear that Bozzone would swim
in the rest of the meet.

“T was feeling just horrible, all

tingly,” she said. “But Allison.

(Hobgood) just brought me out-
side and said, ‘Sit here. You know
if you don’t feel like you can swim
you don’t have to. There’s no pres-
sure. Just calm down and get mov-
ing again.’ She just calmed me
down and made me think I could
swim again.”

Bozzone responded by run-
ning away from the 200 back field,
which included Hobgood (Sth,
2:14.28).

“Tt wasn’t just beating a con-
ference champion, but seeing the
team grow and be supportive is as
rewarding, just ona different level,”
DeSelm said.

“There was the same team

chemistry and atmosphere about
us that we had at Southern States
last year,” Jason Prince said. “All
the hours we have spent trying to
incorporate the freshmen into the
program, and get everyone com-
fortable with each other paid off
this weekend. We were able to
sustain the enthusiasm for the
whole meet, not just in the water
but out. That was exciting to see.”

Freddy Schnell, Michael Hart,
and Scott Harper highlighted the
men’s performance.

Schnell picked up the momen-
tum in the 1000 free, coming from

behind to grab the victory (9:54,46),.

over ECU’s Daniel Fuller
(9:55.31). He also grabbed second
in the 500 free (4:50.09), andswam
the second leg of the winning 400
free relay (3:16.00).

Harper won the 200 free
(1:46.00), was second in the 100
free (48.61), and third in the 200
breast (2:16.12). Michael McCabe
(3rd, 49.19) and Dave Maddux
(4th, 49.55) came in right behind
Harper in the 100 free.

-“Every time he gets in the

pool he seems to swim faster,”

DeSelm said of Harper. “‘A lot of
these times are his lifetime bests,
but it seems like he gets better
every time he jumps off the blocks.”

Michael Hart also turned in
another strong diving performance.
He grabbed second in the 1 meter
competition (239.33), just shy of

- ECU’s Tony Novak (240.00), and

he claimed a narrow victory in the
3 meter contest, beating out GSU’s
Kevin Hyland 230.40 - 229.88.

“This meet was something
we’d been pointing towards all
season,” Prince said. “GSU had
beaten us three straight times, and
we knew if we were going to make
a statement amongst the Southern
States competitors we would have
to do it at this meet.

“Tt’s like Rich (DeSelm) said,
‘If we can swim fast in December
it means we’ ll swim even faster in
February (when the Southern States
meet is held).’ We’ ve set ourselves
up to do that and regain the (South-
ern States) crown.”
