Wrestlers earn exciting win over W&L

By Joun RoE

While most students were rest-
ing over the Christmas holidays,
the Davidson wrestling team was
busy on the mats, preparing for
many tough matches with three-a-
day practices.

WRESTLING

“We outwrestled everyone,
and we were better conditioned
than our opponents. I think our
coming back early from the holi-
days for practice really helped us.

Even in the matches we lost, I felt
that we were wrestling very well,”
coach Tom Qddo said.

Matches against Howard and
Morgan State had to be canceled
due to the snow, and Apprentice
College called off another match
at the last minute.

However, the wrestlers still
had many opportunities to wrestle.

In one of the most exciting
matches yet this season, the wres-
tlers outlasted Washington and Lee
25-24. Despite giving up 24 points
in forfeits, the wrestlers fought back
and didn’t lose a single match.

Freshman Christian ‘Baker
started off by defeating Washing-
ton and Lee’s co-captain with a 6-
0 decision, and Miller Cary fol-

lowed with another victory. In the
177-pound weight class, Seth
Herman defeated his opponent ina
major decision, and at 190 pounds,
Ben Wall squeezed past Washing-
ton and Lee’s Colin Looney in an
exciting and controversial over-
time victory.

Wall controlled the entire
match and earned nine points, but
due to some very questionable calls,
his opponent stayed close and
forced a sudden death overtime.

Wall finally took Looney
down to win the match, pulling
Davidson within five points of
Washington and Lee.

It all came down to the heavy-
weight match, where Davidson’s
Tom Greene needed a pin for a

team victory. In the third round,
Greene pinned his opponent, fin-
ishing an incredible 25-24 come-
back victory.

Thinking that the snowstorm
would cancel their matches some
of the wrestlers came back to school
nearly fifteen pounds overweight,
forcing coach Oddo to juggle the
lineup.

This weight problem, coupled
with a few injuries, weakened the
lineup just enough to cost the team
a few matches.

Against Longwood, the team
gave up three forfeits and could
not overcome the 18-0 deficit. The
final score was 31-30. The match
against Pensacola Christian Col-
lege posed the same problems, and

Davidson lost, 31-21. Davidson’ s
third defeat came at the hands of a
very strong VMI team, but the
Wildcats wrestled very well.

This weekend the team fin-
ished sixth out of eight teams at the
Washington and Lee University
Wrestling Invitational. Washing-
ton and Jefferson won the tourna-
ment with 92.5 points, and Leba-
non Valley nipped Davidson for
fifth with 40 points (the Wildcats
finished with 37).

The Wildcats had two tourna-
ment runner-ups: Chip Stewart in
heavyweight and Ben Wall in the
177-pound class. They also had
two fourth-place finishes: Tom
Greene in the 190-pound class and
Christian Baker in 134.

contracted viral meningitis, a very
contagious and sometimes fatal
disease. Late last week, the stu-
dent had a heart attack and died in
transit to a hospital.

The school then immunized
everybody who had come into con-
tact with him, about 150 students
and some basketball players.

Because effects from that
medicine would have prevented
the players from taking part in the
game and because of an effective
quarantine on those who came in
contact with the stricken student,
Saturday’s game was forced to be
postponed.

The game will made up on
January. 31 at Davidson, and the
teams’ second meeting, scheduled
for February 19, will be moved to
Lexington, Virginia.

The delay was probably just
as well for the Keydets as they
avoided'a run-in with the recently
high-flying Wildcats. Including
December 21’s game against Wil-
liams, Davidson had won four of
five games over the break.

The only setback was an 82-
70 loss to then-No. 19 Michigan at
a tournament in Las Vegas on De-
cember 30. Davidson ‘played the
Wolverines close all game and was
within two points with about four

minutes left.

At that point, Brandon Will-
iams missed a dunk that would
have tied the game, and Mark
Donnelly grabbed the offensive
rebound but missed the follow-up
shot.

From there, the Wolverines
made the requisite free throws and
started pulling away.

But the Wildcats have been
playing great since then, trouncing
two Patriot League teams —
Lafayette and Navy and using a
39-2 run to top East Tennessee
State and an 18-0 run to build an
insurmountable lead over Furman.

Those two conference wins
raised hopes about potentially win-
ning the conference andthe NCAA
tournament bid that goes with it.

McKillop down-played such
optimism. “After we beat ETSU
by 30 points, when we were play-
ing as well as we possibly could
and they were playing as poorly as
they possibly could,” he said, “I
had a lot of people tell me that we
were going to waltz through the
Southern Conference. If that be-
comes your mindset, there’s no
way you can play as need be... We
cannot miss a beat; we cannot let
up an inch. We have to bring our
best to the table every game if
we're going to win.”

While it may not have looked
it, Davidson served up some pretty
good stuff Thursday night in beat-
ing UNCC. By the numbers, the
game certainly was not a thing of

beauty. Davidson’s point total
matched its lowest of the season. It
was the 49ers lowest total in about
12 years.

The Wildcats shot 34 percent
for the game, UNCC 32 percent.
The 49ers helped shoot themselves
in the foot by hitting only 12 of 25
free throws, led by Bobby
Kummer’s 2-of-8 shooting.

The constant in that game, as
it has been most of the season, was
clutch defense. The Wildcats al-
lowed just three points over the
final 4:10 of the game. With a 45-
44 lead, point guard Chris Alpert
made a crucial three-pointer.
Davidson then made enough free
throws.down the stretch to hold on
for the win, retaining the Hornets’
Nest Trophy for the third year ina
row. Williams led the way with 18
points, ten inthe second half. Quinn
Harwoodscored 11 of his 13 points
in the first half and grabbed 11
rebounds.

“The defense has been the con-
stant throughout the year,”
McKillop said. “Our senior lead-

ership and depth are really show-

ing through ... Never before have
we beaten teams so handily. And
it’s all attributed to defensive runs.
Against Furman a 13-point deficit
went to a 21-point lead, and it all
goes back to defense.”

One of the biggest challenges
for the Wildcats over the rest of the
season will be proving their mettle
on the road and not looking past
any opponents.

Davidson has played only
three road games and two neutral-
site games, going 3-2 in those
games.

“The test of this team will be
to become road warriors,”
McKillop said. “Conference play
is not one to be judged by numbers
and statistics. Any team can beat
any team in the conference right

now ... We can’t be putting pres-
sure on ourselves right now be-
yond winning the next game ...
We have to pretend each game is
an NCAA game.”

Davidson is scheduled to re-
turn to action Tuesday night at
Appalachian State but doesn’t play
at home again until January 29
against Georgia Southern.
