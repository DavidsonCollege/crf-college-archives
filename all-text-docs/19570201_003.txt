INVITATIONS

With practice getting underway for both track and
football, Coaches Bill Dole and Heath Whittle are extending
an invitation to all members of the student body who are
interested in either to report for workouts regardless of
previous experience.

Spring football practice begins on Monday of next
week and will extend through twenty days of action.

The track men began working out this past Monday in
preparation particularly for upcoming indoor meets, the first
of which will be the Southern Conference contest at Lexing-
ton, Virginia, February 15. The second will be the Atlantic
Coast Conference meet in Raleigh on February 23.

LOOKING FORWARD

The first meet of the outdoor season will not be until
March 23, but that is just five days before spring vacation.
By getting this early start the team hopes to work into top
condition before the 23rd so that they will not be greatly
affected by the lay off.

Coach Whittle particularly urges freshmen to come down
to the track if they have any desire to try out. This local
mentor of the cinders has been unusually successful in train-
ing boys that come to Davidson without. previous competitive
experience.

Phil Koonce, who graduated in 1956 and held
Southern Conference championships in the 100 and 220
dashes, was an outstanding product of such four-year
tutelage.

SEM! HIGH

With 17 games played, the statistics for Davidson’s bas-
ketball team are beginning to take significant meaning.

Leading the Cats and ranking number eight in the
Southern Conference is Semi Mintz who has a total of
294 points with an average of 17.2 per game. The thin,
confident sophomore from Raleigh is currently hitting a
phenomenal 82 per cent of his foul shots, making 98 of
118.

His closest rival on the squad is Dave Hollingsworth with
204 total points. Dave leads in rebounds with 148, followed
by Lew Spears with 95.

enter as favorites because of their
victory over The Citadel. °

Most of this week has been de-
voted to extensive workouts in
order to get the boys back in
shape after the exam period. How-
ever, Coach Thompson said that
the team wouldn't be back in top
condition until the first of next
week.

With the loss of “Squeaky” Simp-
son dealing a blow to the medley
relay team, other members of the
team will be shouldering a heavier
load. Captain Tommy Rivers, who
swam the anchor leg of the medley
relay against The Citadel and in
addition broke his own record in
the 100 yd. dash by a tenth of
a second, will be counted on heavi-

Ralterree Resigns
Line Coach Position

Accepting a position at The Cita-
del, coach Pride Ratterree resigned
Friday, January 18, from his posi-
tion as head line coach at David-
son College.

Coach Ratterree, since coming to
Davidson in September, had served
as head line coach, coach of the
junior varsity basketball team, and
physical education instructor. He
was to be coach of the baseball
team this spring.

Prior to coming to Davidson,
Ratterree served as head line coach
at Wake Forest for one year, as-
sistant coach at Lenoir Rhyne for
four years, and coach at Staunton
Military Academy for one and one
half years.

During his tenure at Davidson,
Ratterree showed an unusual drive
and desire to win, and produced
one of the best lines that the Wild-
eats have had in recent years.

Battle For |.F. Lead

By BILL HELLIER

Going into the early rounds of
the basketball tournament, the Phi
Delts hold a good lead in the over-
all standings of the jinterfraterni-
ty race.

Right behind are the Kappa Sigs
and K.A.'s. These, first three teams
seem to have the race for first
place all to themselves at the mo-
ment; but on the basis of last
years basketball records, both the
A.T.O.'s and Betas should be pick-
Ing up a few points soon.

As proved by the Phi Gams, a
good showing in one sport can
boost a team’s point total a great
deal. °

In the lower division, there is
a very tight race going on. The Pi
Kapps lead the’ Pikas by only three
tenths of a point and the S.A.E.’s
hold a two point margin on the
Betas.

The unofficial total standings to
date are:

Phi Delt 373.6
Kappa Sig 335.3
K.A, 294.3
Sigma Chi 232.1
A.T.O. 229.5

points each steered the A.T.O.'s

a surprising 18 point margin. The
Sigma Chi’s continued their un-
beaten ways by tripping up the
KA’s, 44 to 37.

Continuing the contests Wed-
nesday night, the Kappa Sigs kept
their record clear of losses with
a 48 to 37 victory over the Phi
Gams. Don Comer led the losers
