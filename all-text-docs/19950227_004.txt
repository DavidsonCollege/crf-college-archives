_ Order of Omega on the horizon

Patterson Court Council establishes first honor society for members of the Court

By SARAH TEACHWORTH

A brand new student organi-
zation is in its planning stages, but
with a target group unlike any ex-
isting campus associations.

The Order of Omega is a na-
tional organization whose purpose
is to recognize fraternity and so-
rority members who have displayed
leadership, intelligence, and com-
munity service qualities. Steve
Shames, President of the Patterson
Court Council, is largely respon-
sible for bringing this respected
organization to campus.

Since Davidson doesn’t host
any national sororities, eating
houses will be permitted to partici-

pate. “I think it’s great that the
eating houses are going to be al-
lowed to be involved even though
we’ re not on a national level,” says
Connor President Jill Dyer.

Shames noticed some of his
fraternity brothers wearing Order
of Omega pins at a Phi Delta Theta
general convention in Arizona last
June and was interested in what
they represented. This fall he spoke
with Dean of Students Tom
Shandley and Patterson Court Ad-
visor Kurt Holmes about the possi-
bility of forming a Davidson chap-
ter. Both Shandley and Holmes
liked the idea.

Shames made the necessary

’ phone calls and received a petition

to charter from The National Or-

der of Omega. Shames says, “In
bringing the Order of Omega to
Davidson, the Patterson Court
Council is attempting to recognize
campus leaders and to show the
contributions people have been
making for their houses, Patterson
Court, and the college community.”
After the petition is approved,
acharter group will be established.
The executive board of the
Patterson Court Council will be
included. Other members of the
Council are encouraged to apply;
Shandley and Holmes will make
the final decisions on whom to
accept to the organization. Once
established, the charter group will
convene to straighten out the lo-
gistics of the Davidson chapter.

Davidson students take advantage of the spring weather by moving
themselves, their friends, and their socializing outdoors in front of Chambers.

LAZY DAYS

from page 1

Council Steve Shames sees the
same kind of conservative body

for “right now, but you never know
what is going to happen. We fully
supported the co-ed eating house,
but without the support of students
there is no need to make adminis-
trative policy. The same goes for

sororities. The possible changes
that might occur on the court might
be a spark to set off change, you
never know. The impetus for
change has to come from the stu-
dents.”

Breaking and entering and larceny from motor vehicle: a pair of Ray-Ban type
sunglasses valued at $8.00 was stolen from a 1995 Jeep Cherokee parked in the west row of
spaces in Belk parking lot. The method of entry was an unsecured rear door.

Warning—The Davidson Campus Police advise all students who are leaving their cars at
Davidson over the break to park their cars in the parking lots of either Baker Sports Complex
or the tennis courts. Police will be monitoring the Baker Sports lot carefully.

ORIENTATION?

The Harmony Committee is currently considering using a play as the focal point
for the 1995 Orientation Diversity Program (formerly the 'Book Discussion’). If you
have specific suggesttions for plays that deal with themes of diversity, transition, or

power, that you think you would have enjoyed reading the summer before your
freshman year, please give the title, along with a synopsis to the Residence Life

Office by March 15.

One of the group’s first duties
will be to decide which students
will be allowed to apply for mem-
bership this spring. Only juniors
and seniors can be inducted into
the association, but it is yet to be
determined whether or not this
year’s graduating class will be per-
mitted to apply. The organizers of
the chapter are hoping that the
membership of Davidson’s first
Order of Omega chapter will be
established before Spring Convo-
cation.

Applicants must be active
members of a Patterson Court
house who have not only. shown
leadership in their house but who
have also demonstrated scholar-
ship, good character, and interest

and participation in campus activi-
ties. The selection process may
include an interview and/or rec-
ommendation of professors, fac-
ulty advisors, and house presidents.
Membership of the Order will be
limited to no more than 3% of the
total Court membership. This
translates into 32 or fewer induct-
ees from fraternities and eating
houses this spring.

Shames is excited about the
organization’s Davidson debut
because it may help to improve the
perception of fraternities and eat-
ing houses. He says, “Changing
people’s mindset about Patterson
Court is a slow process, but it’s a
step in the right direction.”

Stuffin’ the internet
with mail for SGA —

By RANDY HARTWELL

Davidson students looking to
make a pit stop while cruising the
Infobahn can now pull over at the
SGA. Ina move sure to bring the
Student Government Association
into the cyberspace-age, students
can now directly access the SGA
via e-mail. Says SGA Chancellor
Dennis Seavers, “The idea'is to use
the medium to give students an-
other way to get in touch with the
SGA, to let us know about their
concerns, things they’d like
changed about Davidson.”

Students can simply log on to
Pollux and address e-mail to the
user name SGA as they would an-
other Davidson student. Mail will
get routed to the Postmaster, and
then to Seavers at the SGA offices,
where he will forward mail to

whomever it concerns.

SGA President Bill Gullan is
excited about the use of the new
technology as part of day-to-day
SGA business. “I feel it’s part of
the overall scheme of getting more
people involved,” he says, “[Put-
ting SGA on-line] was a natural
step, since so many students use e-
mail.”

Academic Facilities and Ser-
vices Coordinator Lydia Lorenzin
says greater things will come of
the SGA’s new electronic access.

“We hope in the future we can give

more mailing list-type services;
creating this type of user name is
an interim step.” Lorenzin refers
to a method similar to that used by
direct mail catalogs and voice mail
message lists. “For instance, if the
SGA would like to post minutes
that way, students can subscribe to
it,” she says.
