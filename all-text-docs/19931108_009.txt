Thesis: Dating was

more fun in junior high.

It’s taken you weeks to finally get up
the nerve to ask her out. You wait for that
perfect opportunity — whether it’s out of
casual conversation or a planned phone call.
You’re apprehensive because you don’t
know her that well and you are unsure of
what she’II say. But then the words of Robin
Williams start to ring in your ears, “Carpe.
Carpe Diem.” So you do it. You ask her
out...

And she says — YES!

Not knowing whether she said yes be-
cause of genuine interest or out of genuine
Southern courtesy (a girl should always say
yestoan invitation fora date), you decide on
trying the conservative route for the first
date —dinner. You pick her up right on time
because it usually gives a good impression.
Taking a last second glance in the reflecting
window and combing your hair with your
hand, you give the door a casual couple of
knocks. Instinctively you then look the other
way and whistle some obscure song to give
that extra sense of nonchalance. The door
opens and she stands there looking abso-
lutely gorgeous.

“Oh Hey.” You say as if you were
surprised to see her.

The conversation on the way to the car
is sporadic at best as you both are a little
nervous as to what to say. But as the evening

Continues you both start to open up more and
share some secrets. Before you know it
you're sitting at the table conversing like
you’ve been friends for years. You both
seem to be having a wonderful time and
many times you start to think that you really
don’t care whether you become romanti-
cally involved or not because if nothing else
you seem to have found a new friend. But
then at some random time during the dinner
something happens to change your mind.
She gives you a look. A look of not only
interest but more of intrigue. She seems
genuinely interested in you. For just one
brief moment you wonder what it would be
like if you went out with her consistently
and had a relationship that involved more
than just being friends. So far she seems
perfect — funny, intelligent, spontaneous,
and beautiful. Everything you had always
wanted in a girlfriend.

The ride home is almost saddening for
you because you don’t want it to end. You
Start to pry a little in her personal life as you
want to get to know her as well as possible.
You ask of her family, friends, and even ex-
boyfriends. The more she tells you about her
the more you start to like her.

You open the door for her and start to
make the walk back to herroom. On the way
back you can think of nothing but how you

want the night to end. Maybe a Clark Gable
kiss that will sweep her off her feet? Or
maybe play it cool and act like you did her a
favor just by going out with her. People
always say that you never want to ‘snow’ a
girl on the first date because it takes away
the challenge for her and she might lose
interest. Finally you decide that the best
thing to dois just act like yourself. You don’t
know any other way.

“Thad a great time.” You say.

“So did I.” She replies.

“Well maybe we can do it again some
other time.” You suggest.

“Sure.” She says.

And then the game starts...

So what the heck does “sure” mean? It
sure wasn’t the enthusiastic answer you
were hoping for. You don’t know how to
respond. And you wonder what she really
thinks.

The next week is awkward. When you
see her you don’t know how to act. Normal?
Like nothing ever happened? Or maybe you
flirt a little just to test the waters. You decide
to try both but in each case you get the same
stone response. She’s not rude — in fact,
she’s just as nice as she always is. But she
gives no hints of what she thinks and keeps
you guessing.

After contemplating what-your next
move should be you remember the Latin
phrase of “seize the day” once again. You
ask her out and she turns you down because
of-some previous engagement. So you are
back where you started. Is she blowing you
off? Or is she telling the truth? Should you
pursue it? Or forget about it. The last thing
you want to be is some tag-along who can’t
take a hint if it hit you in the face... So you
are stuck.

I don’t know about you but I’ve had
experiences with this “lull period” many
times. Some have worked out really well,
while others haven’t. Don’t get me wrong, I
enjoy going out on dates. The purpose of
dating is to find out if we like someone. It’s
a fundamental foundation of building asolid
relationship. But sometimes I just wish that
the “lull period” of ambiguity could be cut
out. I’m sure I’m not the smoothest guy on
the dates and I’m sure I don’t make all the
right moves. But I can’t help but think that
this type of thing happens to others.

In many ways this reminds me of the
love stories from Junior High School. Those

Relativism is a personal

factor.

The child has sclerosis of
the spine, which means that over

time the spinal sheath will swell.

and constrict the other internal
organs. The process is slow and
painful, and death usually oc-
curs from suffocation or hem-
orrhaging.- The amount of suf-
fering is disproportional to the
child’s morality, not to mention
age and threshold of pain.

The mother of this child
wishes for this inevitable pain
to be as minimal as possible.
Under her direction, the child’s
physician sent a note to the
school that the child attended
saying, if the child ceases to
breathe or collapses in class
from an effect of the sclerosis,
no attempt at resuscitation
should be made.

The school administration,
shocked and, in some cases,
outraged by this letter, have de-
cided that it is not their respon-
sibility to determine when to
deny assistance. .If the child

collapses and ceases to breathe,
they will do everything possible
to resuscitate the child.

The mother’s argument is
valid: she understands that death
is.an imminent reality for -her
child— very painful death, in
fact—and if a less excruciating
end is possible, by all means, let
the child go peacefully.

The school’s argument is
just as strong:. it is an educating
institution not prepared to be
given the responsibility of al-
lowing passive euthanasia.

But what is right? Can any-
one honestly condemn the
mother for wanting aless painful
death for her child? And are the
administrators of the school cruel
for refusing the childa relatively
comfortable passing?

Notice the word “rela-
tively,” which is the key. What
is right and what is wrong in this
situation would be completely
relative to one’s position. Being
the mother, it would obviously

be right to preclude suffering

however possible; yet on the
school board, it would be incon-
ceivable to say that an avoidable
death would be allowed.

If right and wrong are rela-
tive in this situation, where else
does the principle apply?

I remember a joke that I
thought was really funny in jun-
ior high. One person would ask
another, “Are there any abso-
lutes?”

Either out of genuine igno-
tance or because he thought it
was cool, the other person would
respond in the negative. The
punch line was, “Ha! You mo-
ron! By saying there are no abso-
lutes you are creating an abso-
lute!”

It is juvenile, but true. The
very existence of the question
proves the existence of absolutes.
Even if the response to the ques-
tion is, “Whether or not there are
absolutes is relative,” it still im-
plies that in some situations there
are absolutes and, therefore, they
exist.

So, what effect does this
conclusion have on anything? It
certainly narrows down the con-
ditions under which right. and

wrong can be relative.

For example, let’s consider
a hypothetical person. He is
pro-life and considers it wrong
to take the life of an unborn
child under any circumstances.
He does not buy into the pro-
choice argument that everyone

must decide for themselves— |

that he is entitled to his opinion,
but so is the next guy or gal. A
fetus is a life and that is pre-
cious; it cannot ever be justifi-
ably destroyed.
"| His viewsonsexuaf harass-
ment are a bit more lenient. He
believes in some cases the
women just get emotional and
over-sensitive and take things
the wrong way. Granted, the
men can go too far on occasion,
but for the most part, women

_ Should just learn to take a joke.

These two stands are con-
ceptually contradictory. This
hypothetical man is inconsis-
tent in his view of right and
wrong. Hecannotsay that abor-
tion is absolutely wrong but
sexual harassment depends upon
the situation, the people in-
volved, and the extent to which

Cole is not a

radical.

If you havea problem about the speaker
at Senior Convocation, stop complaining
amongst your friends and actually write to
The Davidsonian and explain your case.

‘left Convocation this year remarkably
satisfied and uplifted. Davidson had invited
someone I believed to be one of the most
interesting and composed speakers I have
ever witnessed.

Johnetta Betsch Cole delivered a very
moving and informative speech about multi-
culturalism.

The entire afternoon after her speech I
pondered over her ideas that the future of our
society depends on the decisions that our
generation makes.

She raised such issues as including
people ofall color and sex into our changing
society.

Cole is not radical, Cole is not offen-
sive, Cole is just sensible!!!

I naively believed that her address was
very positively received by our entire senior
class--until I was confronted by several stu-
dents who seemed angered and annoyed by
her remarks. In fact one claimed he did not
want to hear her “liberal b-llsh-t.” Hey,
lighten up.

Cole was not calling for a radical over-
throw of the white male, but rather the
chance for all types of people to have a
chance to succeed.

I also heard another student of the se-
nior class claim that he found it offensive
that Cole addressed the entire audience as
her “sisters and brothers.” He claimed that
since she was black and most of the audi-
ence was white, that we could not possibly
be from the same family.

What this student failed to recognize is
that Cole was addressing us all as human
beings and did not differentiate between
different races.

She was hoping to spark the feelings of
a common Cause amongst us all.

After these upsetting conversations I
started an informal inquiry.

Though many students seemed sympa-
thetic to Cole, there also seems to be a fairly
adamant group of students that were angry
with the administration for inviting her to
speak.

What was it that bothered them!?!?!
She simply called for equal treatment, edu-
cation and employment for all types of
people.

I have heard many people claim that
they have such reactionary views because
“that is the way they have been taught.”

WHY ARE WE STUDYING AT A

Answer: to ponder and question our
stereotypes and beliefs. If people always
trusted and believed everything they were
taught, we could never progress and many
injustices would-continue-to-occur.— Our-
society would simply become stagnant with
reactionary ideals.

It worries me that some intelligent stu-
dents who appear caring and conscientious ©
actually have such racist beliefs. What
frightens me is that many of these people
may be the leaders of our society in the
future.

Iam not claiming that my opinion is the
“correct” opinion, and in fact, if Imade you
angry, (or even made you happy), I invite
you to write a response.

‘We need more open discussion about
these issues instead of segregated groups of
“conservative” and “liberal” people gath-
ered together congratulating themselves on
having similar opinions.

Look to The Davidsonian for ideas.
Look everywhere for ideas.
