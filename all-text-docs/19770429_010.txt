8 women and. 23 men have yet to find | housing

Nicholls sees few problems

‘There are fewer people
without room assignments
this year than last year,” said
Director of Student Housing
Scotty Nicholls after the hous-
ing lottery last week.

Eight rising sophomore wo-
men and 23 rising sophomore

men did not receive rooms.

in the lottery. Problems still
exist because a number of
juniors and seniors have not
contacted Nicholls to tell her
their living plans for next

year. ls addition, some stu-

dents have not paid their $200 .

deposit and therefore were not
allowed to participate in the
drawing.

Nicholls will solve these
problems before school ends
and during the summer.

The eight girls will probably
live in basement Cannon next
year if the basement is not
filled by freshmen women.

‘‘We didn’t have enough
rooms for everyone, but then
we don’t want to, because we
don’t want to have empty beds

in the fall,’’ said Nicholls.

There is a normal attrition

of students between April and
September, according to Nich-
olis.

“‘Some people who get
rooms in the lottery don’t
come back, and others are
looking for a place off-campus
but took part in the drawing
as a safety measure.”

Nicholls said, ‘‘At this point
we couldn’t let additional girls

het:

Summer can be fun if you know a few common things to avoid

1. Do not swim at any beach where they have loudspeakers
playing the soundtrack from “Jaws”

Do not, under any circumstances, try to pick up a cow.

Do not answer any want ad for a summer job that sounds
too good to be true— unless you enjoy selling steak knives.

Do not tell your parents that, after graduation, you have
decided on an exciting career in motel management.

Do not accept a date from anyone wearing a green leisure
suit and roller skates.

Do not, under any circumstances, attempt to feed your pet
gerbil a boa constrictor.

Do not forget the one word for beer. As your Dean of Beer.
I can think of nothing more important for you to remember.

So have fun, have Schlitz, and I'll see you next fall.

WHEN IT'S RIGHT, Gig) ron

legislative hearing in Raleigh
that would influence the cut-
come.of the returnables legi-
slation.

Otherwise known as the
“bottle bill’, the measure (HB
697) would prohibit all non-re-
turnable cans and bottles as
well as flip-top containers
while placing a minimum re-
turnable deposit of $.05 on

_ returnable cans and bottles so

as to encourage their reuse. .

A study made by NC PIRG
found that adoption of this
proposal would result in less
litter, energy savings, an in-
crease in jobs, resource con-
servation along with solid
waste reduction and a cheaper
product to both producers and
consumers.

Faculty members are also
being approached to support
this act by doing whatever
they can to encourage stu-
dents to exercise their demo-
cratic rights. Students are
presently scheduled to testify
before this hearing which be-
gins at 10 am in the Legi-
slative Building.

The group will be leaving
from the back of Cunningham
Fine Arts Building at 6:30 am
due to the early hearing and
are scheduled to return later in
the afternoon.

Name
that

night

Davidson College will
initiate a new entertainment
tradition beginning with next.
year’s Homecoming. A stu-
dent talent night with a very
special slant is slated.

This show will be compa-
rable to the ‘“‘Gator Growl” at
the University of Florida or
the “‘Tigerama’’ night at
Clemson. The idea is to have :
quality student acts, espe-
cially satirical skits aimed at
those things that Davidson
venerates; i.e. grades, frater-
nities, non-fraternities, Slater,
etc.

The suggested name is
“Wildcat Whoopee’, but the
Homecoming Committee
hopes to do better than that.
So the Committee is spon-
soring a contest to Name That
Night. Think of an applicable
name for this new annual
event and submit it.

The contest begins this
Thursday and runs through
Friday, May 6. Submit sug-
gestions at: Mrs, Archie’s desk
in the Dean of Students”
Office.

‘The Committee will decide
which name.is the best and
award.its creator $25.
