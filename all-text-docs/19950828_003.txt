During an intensive selection
process to fill the position of Di-
rector of Residence Life, Kurt
Holmes, former Patterson Court
Advisor was selected to fill the
position recently vacated by Rich-
ard Terry. Terry accepted a posi-

_ tion as Director of Auxiliary Ser-
vices.

Holmes originally started out
onthe search committee appointed
to find the new director, but after
an acceptable successor had not
been found, Holmes withdrew
from the committee and submitted
his application for the position.

“Director of Residence LIfe
was never my goal,” says Holmes.
“Davidson’s Residence Life Of-
fice is really unique since it is
auxiliary. You can consider a lot
of options — you just wouldn’t
get this job anywhere else.”

New RLO Director Kurt Holmes.

Holmes has some long-term
goals forresidence life at Davidson.
“I really see it as the difference
between preferred maintenance and
some new programs. We have got-
ten past the point of just fixing
things now and would like to make
some positive changes, such as
computer networking and study
lounges within the dorms. Of course
none of this is going to happen
overnight, but it is something to
look towards.”

In the short term, Holmes and
a selection committee are looking
to find a replacement for his former
job, Patterson Court Advisor. Cur-
rently, Holmes is filling both posi-
tions. Eighty-five applications were
received for the position and the
committee interviewed four, but
have not reached aconsensus. Two
other applicants may visit Davdison
soon. “We are glad that the stu-
dents are back so that now we can

t a real search.”

Our new town library.

Town library nearing

completion

By JoANNA JOHNSON
Asst. News Editor

A complicated plan and four
years of negotiating have finally
yielded Davidson’s new town li-
brary, situated on the village green.

The town’s 25,000 volumes
will soon be transported to the new
building from the old library space
at'212 South Main Street. Nancy
Dishman, Manager of the Davidson
Library complains that the 1500
square space is insufficient for the
number of books and the number
of people who use the location for
informal gathering. “If we have 10
people in here, we’re crowded.”

Davidson’s town library is a
branch of the - Charlotte-
Mecklenburg Public Library. Li-
brary officials originally. talked
about relieving overcrowding by
combining local branches in
Davidson, Huntersville and
Cornelius into a regional branch.

Davidson library and town

officials responded to the the threat
‘by forming a three-way effort to

save the library.

Library officials approved a
plan offered by the town and
Davidson College to finance the
project. The public, headed by Dr.
John Kelton, executive assistant to
President Kuykendall, began a

campaign in April to raise $136,
000 to finance the new building.
The goal was surpassed by almost
$80,000. Trustees from Davidson
approved a plan for the college to
provide and maintain the site for
the library for 50 years. ©

Construction began last spring
after a temporary fence was built
by local elementary students aided
by Davidson College students. The
fence displayed painted children’s
book covers and the words “Look
into Books” painted with the O’s
as peepholes allowing viewing of
the construction. -

The éxterior of the building
was designed to match neo-classi-
cal designs throughout the campus
and town. The front portico was
designed especially for perfor-
mances and town events.

The inside measures 6000
square feet and reflects a 25% in-
crease in shelving area. Dishman
predicts that more space will espe-
cially benefit children who now
have their own separate area, and
townspeople who now “have a lot
more space to gather and discuss
on an informal basis.”

The new library will be offi-
cially open for public use during
the last week of September, with a
ribbon cutting following in Octo-
ber.

Brown

Dean
Rusk

Ambassador Brown
steps into Jack
Perry’s shoes

By TERESA WHITE ee
Assistant Arts & Living Editor

The Dean Rusk Program for
International Studies hired Ken-
neth Brown as its new director.
Brown recently retired after 34
years in the State Department, serv-

ing mainly in Africa.

Brown has been an amibassa-
dor to Congo (‘82-’84), Céte
d’Ivoire (‘89-’92), and most re-
cently to Ghana, where he earned
his Ph.D. from the University of
Cape Coast. He also served as
deputy assistant Secretary of State
for Africa (‘87-’89) and as the US
Consul General in South Africa
(‘84-"87).

' AtDavidson, his hopes to draw
from extensive background in Af-
rica, notonly within cultural events,
but in the classroom as well. “I
won’t do it this fall, but I'd like-to
teach a class per year, perhaps in
foreign policy or African politics,”
he said.

“T plan to build on the work of
Jack Perry,” Brown said. “There
will be a strong continuation of
previous programs” focusing on
both political and cultural pro-
grams. Students will help develop
and continue the programs.

Brown also plans to work
closely with students interested in
the international studies program
and international careers.

dents who pay to become
“Patterson Court Members” will
be required to wear wristbands at
all advertised parties.
Adapt and tweak

The implementation of the
wristband policy presents the
houses with many changes and
adjustments to make.

According to PCC President | —

Steven Shames, one concern is
that because students who can
drink legally and those who can’t
will be easily distinguishable, un-

derage students will be prevented
from drinking or will be issued
alcohol violations by the Campus
Police.

“Tf you have a clear cup and a
cop sees a person with a hot pink
[underage] wristband, the cop
might be bound to cite that per-
son,” says Shames.

Shames says that houses will
be required to be creative in avoid-
ing such a situation by using col-
ored rather than clear cups, for
example.

Shames also says that the cops
are not at the parties to bust people,
but rather to keep the party safe for

everyone.
Another concern, says
Shames, is that during prime party

hours, between 10 and 11 accord-
ing to Shames, houses could em-
ploy several people to check IDs or
post checkpoints at the front and
back doors.

Shames says it will take “a
concerted effort on the part of the
houses” to make the. logistics of
the new plan work smoothly.

He is optimistic that the char-
acter and enjoyment of Court par-

ties will not be affected by the
wristband plan. “Hopefully, it re-
ally shouldn’t change things that
much,”

Independents will also be vot-
ing members of the PCC starting
this year. Since independents will
be contributing money for Court
parties, Shames says “PCC mem-
bers. not affiliated with a house
now deserve representation.”

The independent representa-
tives will be elected early this se-
mester, but the exact format of the
election is yet to be determined.
Shames plans to consult the SGA
about the best way to conduct the
election.

Shames believes that this new
plan will actually create greater
unity between independent and
affiliated students. “Everybody
feltthey [independents] were a part
[of the Court], now they definitely
are.”

Shames recognizes that un-
foreseen problems will arise and
promises that the PCC will “defi-
nitely evaluate as we go. .. . It [the
plan] will need to be refined.”
