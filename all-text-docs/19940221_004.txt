Davidson’s administration

and its fraternities have struggled _

over the years with issues of ac-
ceptance, propriety, and place. At
first, the secret societies were not
welcome, but as trends changed
and students embraced the social
opportunites of these groups, the
administration warmed up a little.
They never did, however, want to
give them free reign. We can

measure their attempts to find a
balance between control and free-
dom by examining the changing
housing situations of fraternities
between 1917 and 1929, the year
when the current housing system
began.

Students grew tired of the
cramped fraternity rooms in Old
Chambers they had occupied since
1884, The "incessant" player pi-
anos and phonographs kept stu-
dents from sleeping at night, and
from studying in the day (sound
familiar?). Moreover, female
guests could not visit the rooms.
The faculty and the trustees de-

Fraternity origins

cided in May of 1914 to open up

_the downstairs of Eu and Phi Halls

to one chapter each, and Oak and
Elm Rows to two each, for use as
meeting and social rooms. This
decision proved timely consider-
ing the burning of Old Chambers
just seven years later. So by 1917,
the “Fraternity Quadrangle” was
occupied and the rooms furnished
quite comfortably.

The Board of Trustees, still
wary in 1918 of secret societies,
complained about the exclusive-
ness of the increasingly popular
fraternities and their dominance of
student life over the literary societ-
ies, which they saw as providing at
least some scholarly benefit. Just
three years later, in 1921, the fac-
ulty ruled to permit “an increase in
the number of the Greek Letter
fraternities so that the needs of the
increased student body may be
met.” Either attitudes had changed
or the faculty had more perception
about the social demands of stu-
dents than the Trustees did. Re-
gardless, this opened the door to
additional local and national fra-
ternities.

The first national fraternity to
arrive under this provision was Phi
Gamma Delta, which asorbed the
local Bachelors’ Club in 1923.
Fiji’s installation did not, curiously
enough, occur in the former Bach-

elors’ meeting room in Phi Hall.

_Rather, Sigma Alpha Epsilon lent _

its chapter room in one of the Rows
for this event. Phi Hall obviously
didn’t provide Phi Gamma Delta
or any other fraternity what it
needed in terms of size, privacy, or
what have you. But new lodging
would come in justa few years. As
the number of chapters exceeded
the six rooms in the Fraternity
Quadrangle, the short—funded Col-
lege had to give fraternities per-
mission to find their own solution.

Davidson students had long
eaten at boarding houses operated
by professors or ladies in town.
The few who didn’t live in the
dorms could live in one, with a
total in 1926 of just thirty-five stu-
dents taking that option. By that

time, however, the way the more ~

than fourteen boarding houses ran
changed, thanks to fraternities.
Davidson historian Mary D. Beaty
explains that in 1925 they [the
Davidson fraternities] gained
grudging permission to have chap-
ter houses off the campus. Phi
Gamma Delta and Sigma Alpha
Epsilon took the lead. Mrs. Olin
White became house mother as
well as boarding house operator
for the Phi Gams; eight members
of the fraternity roomed in her
house across from the Davidson
High School, and all of them ate

there. Atleast nine boarding houses
which had been open to the entire
student body became, each of them,
particularly associated with one
fraternity.

All the fraternities also ob-
tained chapter houses for meeting
and socializing. The Kappa Sigs

hada house righton Concord, about
where Jackson Court is today. Just
accross the street the PhiGams had
their chapter house, just off Con-
cordon Woodland. Otherchapters
had to find more distant-housing.

1994-95 Hall
Counselors
selected

By Beth Lindsey

Those who visited the post
office last Tuesday, may have dis-
covered a little more excitement
than usual. Shrieks of joy and
looks of dismay filled the usually
subdued place as sophomores
found out if they were included in
the list of those selected to be hall
counselors for 1994-95.

The selection process for hall
counselor positions began last De-
cember. After an organizational
meeting in November, interested
students received applications con-
sisting of five essay questions.
Applicants confronted difficult is-
sues such as personal definitions
of a good hall counselor, descrip-
tions of the reputation of an ideal
freshmen hall, and methods of en-
forcing the alcohol policy.

After all written applications
were received by the Dean of Stu-
dents office, interviews were
scheduled. Applicants had to sign
up for two separate 15-minute in-
terviews in which they were again
put to the test in discussions of
themselves and hypothetical situa-
tions on a hall. The committee of
interviewers consisted of the three
deans ofstudents, current male and
female hal} ¢ounselors, a freshman
representative, a senior represen-
tative, and the current freshmen

advisors, Wendy McHugh and
John Murchison.

After much deliberation, the
committee made its final decisidns

and notified students of the results
last week. Competition was stiff,
as 70 sophomore men and women
applied forthe position of hall coun-
selor this year. The final list con-

sisted of twenty males and four-
teen females with six others se-

lected as alternates.
Laura Jefferson feels that be-

ing a hall counselor will be “a
unique learning experience. I am
excited to relive some my fondest
memories of my freshman year
through their first experiences."

Senior services offers tax hel

By Mary Laura Moretz

Students bewildered by tax
forms have free assistance waiting
for them at Davidson Senior Ser-
vices. For almost fifteen years,
this service has been available to
the public.

However, says Senior Ser-
vices secretary Joan Hagen,
“We've only had a few students
straggle in. We decided it was time
to advertise.”

The center has five staff mem-
bers ready to rescue anyone from
the often confusing process of fil-
ing income tax returns. Students
seeking assistance need only bring
W-2 forms, any information on

their taxes, and returns from Tast
year if they ‘have them. ° ~

All single persons under age
65 must file returns on their in-
come, even if they are counted as
dependents on their parents’ re-
turns.

Davidson Senior Services is
located in the Depot at the corner
of Depot and Jackson Street. For
appointments, students can call
892-5111 on weekdays from 9a.m.
tonoon. Hagen says that the staff
prefers to make appointments for
the morning, but since “that can be
impossible on a student’s sched-
ule,” they can also keep more flex-
ible hours if necessary.
