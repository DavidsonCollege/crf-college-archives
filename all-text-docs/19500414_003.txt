Although a great
deal of time and effort
obviously, went into
planning the interfra-
ternity sports’ program
for this semester, the
net result has not been
too satisfactory. We
would like to present
our ideas on the subject
and leave it to the pow:
ers-that-be to look into
the situation thurough-
ly in order to avoid u
repetition next year of
the oft-times confusion
that existed this year.

In the first place, it
is our belief that too many different sports were planned for the
fraternities in the time whieh was available for them to be
played. Even with only basketball, volleyball, the track meet
and softball last year, the program was too crowded and as 2
result interest in the volley ball games, particularly, was non-
existent. But with the addition of a basketball tournament, a
swimming meet and handball rounds this vear, the strain on the
participating men has been too great.

Isveryone will admit that the interfraternity contests are
one of the most interesting activities of a fraternity, but it
seems that a program which requires—as has been the case this

face made it extremely difficult
for the pitchers to control the pitch-
es, and' it aided the batters a great
deal.

The entire game was a see-saw
battle with the lead chatiging hands
two times before the seventh inning

To us, one of the most undesirable reswits of the situation
this Spring has been the fact that it has been, and still is, neces
sary to run-off fraternity games on the same afternoons that
varsity teams are playing. With regard to this, the fraternity
men should be able to support the school’s team when they arc
playing, and if a poll were taken among these men as to whether
they would rather watch the varsity games or play. in frater-
nity contests, the sentiment would most surely be in favor of the
former.

The situation was unavoidable because of the way ‘it was
set-up this Spring and we believe that the best way to avoid’
repetition of this next year is to revise the whole program. Spe-
cifieally, we would favor a shorter basketball tournament and
elimination of handball and volleyball. This would still leav:
basketball, track, swimming and softball to be run-off during
the second term of school, and with a program such as this it
could be spread out more, thus avoiding the necessity of fra
ternities playing on the same day that varsity squads do, among
other things.

Every true fraternity man takes pride in his group's ac-
complishments in competition with other organizations on the
campus and that is certainly the way it should be. But when the
program is as time-consuming as it has been this year, there
looms a greater danger of participation’s becoming a necessary
chore rather than a pleasure. We have all seen dofinite indica
tions that such an idea may have taken roots this year.

As a first step in correcting the existing situation, we
would suggest that a meeting of Pete Whittle and represen-
tatives from each fraternity on the campus be held before
school is out this year to map out some definite schedule of
events for next year and to discuss the whole matter

Keesler was just too hat. and he.had

Allen Strand beat Willson of
Kalamazoo, 6.3, and 6-4, in a good
match that saw Strand take ad
vantage of his opponent's weak
back-hand, Allan Fanjoy of David
son andl Gordon Dolbce played “hot
and cold” tennis all through: the
match before Fanjoy nosed Dolbee
out 2-5, 6.2 and 6-4. Davidson's
Rob Palmer played spectacular
tennis to beat Brad Alfen, 5-7, 6-2
and 6-1. Palmer's play during ‘the
last two sets was outstanding.

In the doubles, Roddey and Cobb
lost 3.6, 4-6 to Sunderland and
Martin. It was the first time Da-
vidson’s number one team has lost
this season. Sunderland and Martin
were just too hot to be denied. Ted

and Waters of Kalamazoo, 6-4, 8-10,

breaks. Fanjoy and Strand of Da.

Kalamazoo team gave them an im-

seasons, Blake Bradley. Blake had
been counted out of the future for
this season because of shin splints,
bad feet, and a general rundown
condition from the tough cross-
country grind, Bradley had vowed
- never to set foot on a track again
because of the bad effects it had
| had on him. But. with the coming of
spring and the bright sunshine beat.
ing down on the  undershirted
spikemen striding around the cinder
oval, the old fever began running
through his veins again and he
just had to get some shorts and
spikes on in spite of his ills. To
give the story a happy ending
Blake got into good shape and
made the trip to Columbia with the
squad to meet the University of
South Carolina in a track duel. He
came through in his usual winning
style copping a first place in the
mile and a third place in the half-
mile, a race which he had never
run before. Now he is looking for-
ward to another great séason like
‘he had last year. However Blake
and Coach Whittle agree on one
thing, and the feeling is that Blake
should stick to one race. So from
now on it will be Bradley picking
up firsts in the mile.

Blake Bradley is a junior from
Decatur, Georgia, and a” member
of Kappa Alpha order. He has won
letters for three years in cross-
country and track so he spends
most of his time moving those
pins up and down even in the
summer which he spends running
up and down mountains at the
Athen’s “Y" Camp high in the
hills of North Georgia.

ly the tide turned the other way
and things began to look brighter.
Perhaps the gréatest factor in this
sudden change in the outlook was
the return to the cinder paths of

attempts of a well-balanced N. C.

The State golfers did manage to
hold the smooth swinging Presby-
terians to a tie Monday afternoon,
though, for the first blemish on an
otherwise perfect Wildcat record.
The score was 13 1-2 to 13 1.2.

Playing on the beautiful but test-
ing Charlotte Country Club
course, Monty Hill was = again
medalist for Davidson with a good
74, but fost his match to Spencer of
State, who turned in a sub-par 71,
low score for both teams. The
other Wildcats came through to
pile up enough points to tie the
match, however, and preserve their
record. Stuart Dickson and Bob
Bumbarger both won their matches,
Ben Vernon tied, while Slimey
Sloan and Cecil Brandon were
handed setbacks. In the best ball
matches, Hill and Sloan lost, but
Dickson and Brandon won, as did
Bumbarger and Vernon.

The Davidson team had won
four straight matches until Mon-
day, all against top-flight competi-
tion. State was the first team to
even come close to handing the
boys a defeat, but stiff compe-
tition had been expected from
them all along. A few breaks on
the last green and State could have
been victim number five for the
Cats, but instead the Wildcat-putt-
ers failed and State gained a tie,
