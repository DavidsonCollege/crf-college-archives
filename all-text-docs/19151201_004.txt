SENIOR ORATORICAL

(Concluded from page 1)
ol ——— ele

The team was composed of Porter,
captain; Shane, Young, Price, Bennett,
D. I. McKeithen, and Murray.

The program was opened by 2 num-
ber of striking pyramids built by the
team. This was followed by an exhibi-
tion of tumbling, diving, spring-board
work and throwing.

The work of Bennett on the mat
brought a round of applause from the
audience.

The horse was then led on the stage
and the team put him through _ his
“stunts.”

When the horizontal bar work was
begun, the fastening of the bar pulled
loose, almost resulting in a serious ac-
cident but for the quick work of the
clown who caught the bar and turned
the incident into a laugh. Fvery one re-
gretted this accident very much as some
of their best performances were on the
bar.

Price closed the program by an ex-
hibition of Chinese rope jumping.
