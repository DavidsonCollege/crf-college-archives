DAVIDSONIAN

Bruiser plays dumb

Amherst, Mass. - These are
not the most joyous of days at
UMass.

Not only are the Minutemen

Men’s Basketball

Notebook

floundering a year after going 35-
2 and securing a Final Four berth,
but an NCAA investigation looms
and probation is a possibility.

Former UMass center Marcus
Camby, last year’s national player
of the year and currently a rookie
with the Toronto Raptors, report-
edly accepted gifts of money, jew-
elry, and prostitutes from wooing
agent Wesley Spears during last
year’s memorable campaign.

Depending on whatthe NCAA
determines, UMass could have to
forfeit all 35 of its 1995-96 wins
and its Final Four status.

When asked about the contro-
versy, Minuteman coach Bruiser
Flint responded, somewhat jok-
ingly, “What controversy?”

When reminded of the Camby
fiasco (as if
he needed
to be), the
rookie
helmsman
said, “Half
of these
guy s
weren’t

2 oe even here
Bruiser Flint during that
peiod. They don’t know what’s
going on with the Camby situa-
tion. As long as we’re not on
probation, that’s all they care
about.”

Marshall returns

After a debilitating bout with
Hepatitis A during the preseason
and a lengthy recuperation period,
rookie Stephen Marshall made his

_ college debut in the 75-57 win at
New Hampshire on Dec. 21.

Marshall, a 6-8 forward from
Midlothian, Va., known for his
vicious rebounding, scored four
points on
four noth-
ing-but-net
free throws
in 7 min-
utes.

“Tt felt
great,” said
Marshall.
“My endur-
ance still Marshall _
isn’t there like it was andI’ mnotas
strong as I was. And I’m not con-
fident with all the plays yet, so
there’s still a lot ofimprovement to
be done.”

“Tt’s great to have him on
board,” added coach McKillop.
“He’s a presence to allow Landry
and Chadd to get some rest. That
(Kosmalski-Holmes-Marshall) is
a pretty good frontcourt rotation
right there.” :

Marshall added another four
vs. UMass and eight against Geor-
gia Southern Jan. 11.

An 11-point, 6-rebound per-
formance in the win over Western
Carolina a week ago was his best to
date.

Halbauer coming into his
own

Coming to a new country and
adapting to a different culture is
difficult. Doing all of that and
adjusting to the American style of
basketball is that much more chal-
lenging.

But that’s exactly what Davor
Halbauer -
has done
and is do-
ing. - And
quite wellat
that.

A 6-3
guard from
Zagreb,
Croatia,
Halbauer
has become
a key reserve in coach McKillop’s
rotation, averaging 15.9 minutes
and 4.5 points a game.

He buried a key three-pointer
late in the second half vs. UNC
Charlotte and notched nine points
in 22 minutes against UMass.

Despite being upended in the
paint and taking a nasty spill on his
head against the Minutemen, the
gutsy Halbauer returned less than
three minutes later to post a flaw-
less shooting night. He was 3-for-
3 from the field, including 2-of-2
from three-point land, and 1-for-1
at the line.

“He has a history of concus-
sions, so we watch it very closely
when he gets hit in the head,” com-
mented McKillop. “He hada won-
derful game for us and really com-
peted very hard.”

Halbauer also had acareerhigh
10 points against Marshall Jan. 8.

Southern Conference has
nowhere to go but North

So far the only two Southern
‘Conference squads that have fared
even reasonably well against some
of the nation’s stiffest competition
have been Davidson and Marshall.

The Thundering Herd, picked
tops in the Northern Division in
the preseason by the coaches and
media, tested then fifth-ranked
(now No. 3) Clemson over the

-break before finally bowing out,

73-57.

Some other scores of note from
over the Holidays: Duke 104,
Western 54; South Carolina 100,
Furman 62; Tennessee 54, East
Tenn. St. 40; Coastal Carolina 61,
Georgia Southern 21.

Even UT-Chattanooga, the
odds-on favorite to represent the
conference in the NCAAs, has not
lived up completely to its advanced
billing up to this point, struggling
in December.

The Mocs, led by standout
and NBA lottery prospect Johnny
Taylor, barely made it to the cham-
pionship game of their own tour-
nament. There, they lost to
Canisius, 63-49...

The Ole Miss Rebels, whom
the Wildcats beat Dec. 2, 59-56,
ascended to No. 20 in the AP poll

Carolyn Kirsch goes in for a lay-up against UMBC last week. The
Wildcats won 81-58 behind Kirsch’s 20 points and 5 boards.

last week before losing to state
rival Miss. St. and Vanderbilt. In
its SEC opener, Ole Miss upset
then 22nd-ranked Arkansas in
Fayetteville and shocked then No.
3 Kentucky Jan. 11...

UNCC has also been hot since
edging the Wildcats, posting con-
vincing victories over Tennessee
and George Washington in the past
few weeks. They are currently 1 1-
4, 3-1 C-USA.

Ali floats like a butterfly,

stings like a bee

As of games through Jan. 13,
Ali-Ton stood 22nd in the nation
and 2nd in the league in assists,
averaging 6.2 per game. With his
10-assist performance on Satur-
day vs. UTC, Ton will likely move
up a few slots.

Ton also added six points and
nine rebounds against UTC, leav-
ing him just two buckets and a
-single rebound away from a triple-
double.

The ten assists marked the sec-
ond time this season the 6-0 sopho-
more court general notched double
figures in assists. Chris Alpert,
Ton’s predecessor at point guard,
had one such game over the last
two years of his illustrious career.

Sagarin speaks

Davidson’s non-conference
schedule, including such powers

as Wake Forest, Duke, UMass, Ole

Miss, and UNCC, was rated the
23rd-toughest in the country by
USA Today sports-computer-rank-
ing guru Jeff Sagarin.

Injury update

Halbauer, who sat out
Saturday’s contest with a bruised
knee suffered last week in prac-
tice, will likely return to action
tonight vs. App. St.

Marshall, who turned his ankle
in the first half on Saturday after
playing just six minutes, is doubt-

ful for tonight, but hopeful for,

Wednesday’s trip to East Tenn. St.

Women from page 1

Her two baskets in the final
four ticks provided an exclama-
tion point to a what may one day be

‘| looked back onas a definitive over-

the-hump week for Davidson
women’s basketball.

“T don’t know if I’ ve everséen
a more dramatic four seconds.
These are the type of games that
make for hopefully a great sea-
son,” said coach John Filar. “Jamie
wants the ball in those final sec-
onds and she drained those shots.”

Despite being outplayed for
most of the first half, Davidson
slowly cut into an eight-point defi-
cit and trailed by only a point at
halftime:

After the two teams traded
scoring runs at the beginning of the
second frame, the game was tight

throughout the last eight minutes -

with neither team gaining more
than a four-point advantage. The
Mocs went ahead by two on a
putback, setting the stage for the
fantastic finish.

“We’ ve been doing a lot of the
big things well,” added Filar. “This
team has a lot of confidence in
themselves.”

‘Much of that confidence
stemmed from a 60-58 victory
Monday over App. St., the defend-
ing league champion. The win
was the program’s first ever over
the perennial power Mountaineers.

Senior forward Carolyn
Kirsch continued her spectacular
play of late, going for 19 points
and 9 rebounds. Her jumper early
in the second half gave the Wild-
cats their first lead of the game, 38-
37.

Davidson did not lead again
until the 2:34 mark, when Jennie
Vanlerberghe found Kirsch under
the basket for a layup. O’ Brien hit
a clutch free throw with 14 sec-
onds remaining to push the lead to
two.

But with less than a second
remaining, Jamie Brown fouled
Merideth Thompson.

After missing the first free
throw, Thompson intentionally
missed the second and O’Brien

grabbed the rebound, sealing the
breakthrough win.

The last piece of the puzzle
was an 81-58 non-conference win
over Maryland Baltimore-County
Thursday night.

Davidson, riding high from
its emotional win over Appala-
chian, came out of the gate slug-
gish, but were able to pull away
late in the game.

“A letdown was a concer
with Appalachian being by far the
biggest win since I’ve been here,

‘but we pushed it up a level in the

second half,” said Filar. ““There’s
not one soul out there who played
unselfish ball.”

Davidson won two of three
other games played during winter
break. They shot 51 % from the
floor en route to a 100-79. thump-
ing of Manhattan Dec. 19.

The winning streak contin-
ued with a 93-79 defeat Dec. 30 at
Winthrop. The Wildcats received .
solid performances from Kirsch
and Brown who tallied 21 and 19
points, respectively.

Katy Kamp, filling in for an
injured Vanlerberghe, notched 11
points and six boards in her first
career start.

The only loss of the stretch
came in a 72-60 defeat at the Col-
lege of Charleston on Jan. 6 in a
non-league game. :

The squad has now won nine
of its last ten and has an impres-
sive 11-3 record and is the only
remaining unbeaten in the South-
ern Conference. The 11 wins leave
the Wildcats just three shy of last
season’s program-best total of 14.

There have been several keys
to the team’s stellar performance;
during the first half of the season.

First, Kirsch is having a ban-
ner season. After scoring a ca-
reer-high 26 points in an 84-65
win over Western Carolina in the
league opener on Jan. 11 and 19
against App. St., she was named —
conference player of the week.

Bench play has been another

.contributing factor to the recent

success. Despite having Jessica
Montrella and Kerry Brown on
the bench due to illness, the Wild-
cats have not missed a step.

O’ Brien scored a career high
13 in her first career start against
Western. Three players (Danielle
Mall, Amy Scalcucci, and Meagan
Gleason) drained three-pointers in
the decisive run against UMBC.

As Kirsch remarked, “We can
put any five players out there and
win a game.”

Finally, the team has played
tenacious defense during this
stretch. The Wildcats held pre-
season conference player of the
year Andreia Hinton of App. St. to
just five points and lead the league
in field goal percentage defense
(38.2%).

With a pair of two-point wins
in the last week, this season is
slowly, but surely growing into
what could become a dream year
for the women’s basketball team.

And if it ends up taking the
Wildcats where they would like it
to (a league title), perhaps they
will look back on this week as the
biggest in program history.

A week of breakthroughs and
fantastic finishes.

A week of questions answered
and statements made - to others,
indeed, but more importantly, to
themselves.
