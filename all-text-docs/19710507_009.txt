‘Bastard Snus’

Begin IMACPlay

A group of guys on first
floor Richardson have form-
ed a softball team and are
playing in the IMAC in place
of the Sigma Nus.

Due to lack of
and interest, the Nus
unable to field a team, so
Dave Scarborough and
George Shingles of first Rich-
ardson. suggested to Scott
Beard, Snu IMAC represent
ative, that the hall.team be
allowed to fill out the Snu
team,

This proposal was agreed

numbers
were

upon and the ‘‘Bastard Snus’~-

(so-called because
_an. illegitimate
team) began play.

Actually, -of the eleven
_ players making up the core
of the team, there are no ac-
tive Snus, but five former
Snus, two of whom have
heen active this year. Two
players from fourth Belk al
so play.

First Richardson is. a close
hall, and as Greg Johnson
says, ‘We have great enthu-
siasm and.team spirit be-
cause we organized the team
as good friends.”’

This type of organization
may be the basis of intra
mural play next year, with
the tremendous changes ac-
companying the switch to the
new social system.

According to a spokesman
for the group, ““We're just a
group of guys who wanted to
play organized softball, and
we're having a hell of a lot
of fun doing it.’

The team has not done
bady. Its record is 4-4,
although officially it is only
2-8, since before’ this week
the team was not recognized

by the IMAC and had to for
feit all its games.

There have been defensive

experience. But the team
