Movie Review
Seeing
Needful
Things isn't
necessary

By Scott McLean

This week, asanice little break
before Hollywood totes out its se-
rious Oscar-contending films
(starting with Martin Scorsese’s
“The Age of Innocence”) at the
end of this month, I decided to see
something interesting that did not
require much mental effort to en-

_ joy before I actually have to think

about what I’m viewing. The lat-
est film adaptation of a Stephen
King novel, “Needful Things,”
seemed to fit the bill nicely. With
such classic film versions of King’s
books as “Carrie” and “The Shin-
ing” out there as shimmering ex-
amples of what good movies are
made of, I figured perhaps there
was a potential winner here that I
ought to check out.

Well folks, I figured wrong.
Maybe I had delusions of grandeur
concerning King-based flicks af-
ter the Oscar-winning “Misery”
was released, or maybe the cast,
which included such seasoned vet-
erans as Ed Harris, Bonny Bedelia,
and Max von Sydow, fooled me
into thinking that there was no way
this film could go wrong. What-
ever the reason, you always know
that something isn’t quite right
when people start to leave the the-
ater midway through the movie,

you know what I mean?

As the film opens, a new resi-
dent has set up shop in the town of
Castle Rock- literally. Von Sydow
plays Leland Gaunt, whose new
curiosity shop, Needful Things, is
the talk of the town; everyone is
scurrying in to lookat the extremely
rare items for salé-and to meet the
devilishly charming owner. Need-
less to say, something strange is
afoot in Castle Rock. The only one
who seems to have the first clue is
Sheriff Alan Pangborn (Harris)
who, along with his fiance (Bonnie
Bedelia), tries to get to the bottom
of the strange happenings that have
occurred since Gaunt came totown.
What sounds like a simple story
line here becomes an exercise in
pain for those waiting to see how it
turns out.

I guess the producers did not
realize that this one’s been done
before (and much better I might
add) in “Something Wicked This
Way Comes” adapted from a story
by Ray Bradbury. If they had been
aware of this then perhaps they
would have spared us this third-
rate presentation. I won’t waste
space here telling y’all exactly what
was wrong with the film (‘cause
Lord knows the last thing anyone
needs on asummer day is more hot
air), but sufficed to say that unless
you’re an insomniac desperately
looking: for a cure then I’d avoid
this one like the plague. That be-
ing said I’1l sign off now and until
next time, Happy Film Going!

Still Whistlin' Dixie

Kenny G, Clint Black, and the summer's country

By Geoff Graham

This summer saw wondrous
happenings in the world of country
music. For those of you who were
out of the country, or perhaps too
far north to hear the wailings of
Willie and the boys, let me fill you
in, for you’ve missed much.

Billy Ray Cyrus spat out an-
other album entitled, sadly for us,
Won’tBe TheLast. Inaddition, the
rat-tailed superstar, to everyone’s
surprise, never came to actual
blows with his equally charismatic
nemesis, Travis Tritt. The. dust
won’ t stay settled forlong. Expect
the two performers on “Grudge
Match” before the month’s end,

and place your bets on the Georgia
boy.

On a brighter note, Aaron
Neville, of R & B fame, is appar-
ently a George Jones fan. The big,
burly man shows off an impressive
drawl, without losing a touch of
soul, in his cover of “The Grand
Tour.” His appearance in country
music, be it however fleeting, prob-
ably doubles the number of Afri-
can-Americans (the goateed Cleve
Francis is the other) currently on
the country air waves, Go Aaron,
you did George proud.

The biggest news of the sum-
mer was not, however, Billy Ray
and Travis, Aaron, or even Randy

Travis’ stellar performance in an-
other fantastic episode of Matlock.
Even Mark Chestnutt’s recent
cover of the Bangles’ classic
“Manic Monday” couldn’t hold a
candle tothis great, big news: Clint
Blackand Wynonna Judd, together,
on stage. The promoters touted the
concert as the “hottest ticket of the
summer,” and dagnabit, I would
love to have agreed with them.

I missed the tour in Atlanta, so
without hesitation, I hopped in my
four-wheel drive, “whiskey bent
and hell bound” for Hilton Head.
Little did I know, it was fixin’ to
come up a storm. To make a long
story short, we missed Wynonna.

Professor Cort Savage works in the studio. His interactive pieces are unique and striking.

Prof Savage's work on display in VAC

By Allison Wright
Strange things are going on in
Davidson's new Visual Arts Cen-
ter. Walking in to the gallery,

visitors do not walk up to the art, it —

confronts the viewer instead.

On display isa group of sculp-
tures created by Davidson profes-
sor, Cort Savage. His interactive
works are brought to life by their
sounds and movements. The re-
sult: the art forces a reaction from
its audience.

Resembling a large vacuum
turned inside out, "The Insufflator"
seems to actually breathe as it al-
ternately sucks in and blows out

. warm air. The kidney-like shape,

electrical probes, and gentle vibra-
tions of "Proiscidea" connote an
unknown bodily organ while
"Pseudoscience and Baby Toys"
excretes blue hanballs at regulated
intervals.

The unique juxtaposition of
synthetic and organic in Savage's
work fascinates, and, as art critic
Richard Shiff puts it, "extends the
sensory apparatus normally
brought into play by a sculptural
presence."

Sheff associates a sense of
dread with Savage's entertaining
but unnerving pieces of sculpture.
Savage elaborates on this descrip-
tion by saying that his works give
a feeling that something is about to
happen or make one feel slightly

out of control. It is, in Savage's
words, an "increasing autonomy
of the art itself that evokes this
sense of impending doom.

For the amateur art critic, Cort
Savage's sculptures are truly inde-
scribable. Davidson is privileged
to have such an amazing display of
fine art by the three artists in resi-

dence on campus.

The sculptures are part of the
new $9.1 million Visual Arts
Center's opening displays. The
center was just recently opened
across the Main Street from Phi
and Eu Hall. Its primary focus isto
provide much needed space for art
work by Davidsonians.

She was just leaving the stage when
we crossed the bridge to a rainy
Hilton Head. Sure enough, the
man didn’t show. It was too wet in
the stadium. My fifty dollar, “rain
or shine” tickets disagreed. After
much protest, the management
gave in. They offered us free Kenny
G tickets instead of a full refund
(thus saving us the trouble of wait-
ing in the long, long line). I po-
litely declined.

What really ticked me off,
though, wasn’t the late cancella-
tion. It wasn’t even waiting in the
rain for three hours before the show
was Officially canceled. The man
never came out to say I’m sorry.
Not one autograph. How hard
would it have been?

But, as much as [ hate Clint
Black, I love his music. The new
album, No Time to Kill, is great. If
you listen to country radio, you’ve
already heard “A Bad Goodbye”
andthe title track. If you like them,
buy the album. There’s plenty
more where that came from.

The album does have its weak
points. “A Good Runof Bad Luck,”
for all its intensity, falls short of
any sort of “We Tell Ourselves”
from The Hard Way. If you own
his first album, you’ll recognize
“Ill Take Texas” as another
equally unexciting “Straight From
the Factory.” Clint finishes the
album with “Tuckered Out,” asong
of infinite word plays. If you can
get past the hokiness of the lyrics,
you might enjoy the tune.

The rest of the album, how-
ever, should be on the radio. Ex-
pect to hear “State of Mind” any
day now. Clint lets loose with a
harmonica solo, playing on alevel/*
I never expected, and follows wi
what might be his best song se
“Killin’ Time.” With the assis;
tance of Wynonna and Jimmy,
Buffett, as well Jas backgrourid
vocals from the mighty Kenny
Loggins, the album surpasses all
my expectations. If I can like No
Time To Kill after what Clint put
me through, anyone can.

Are You Gonna Go Lenny's Way?

By Rachel Newcomb
Back when the "Cosby Show"

was popular, when I was ten or.

eleven years old, I worshiped Lisa
Bonet, who played Denise. With
her cool personality and off-beat
fashion sense, she was the kind of
teenager wanted tobe. Whenever
Isaw pictures of her in magazines,
I started to notice she was often
linked with “musician Lenny
Kravitz.” I tucked this informa-
tion away in my mind for the time
being, thinking he was probably
nothing special. His name wasn’t
even catchy, like Prince, and he
dressed funny. I was surprised
when they got married, Lisa got a
nose ring, appeared in “Angel
Heart,” and had a baby. On the
"Cosby Show," her character went
off to Africa, then married a guy in
the army. Vanessa was the new
teenager in the house, and I was
disappointed. Shecertainly wasn’t

as cool as Lisa, who it seemed, toa
twelve year old, had gone off the
deep end.

It’s funny how things turn out.
Today, Lisa Bonet might be cat-
egorized as a has-been actress,
while her former husband Lenny
Kravitz has been catapulted into
stardom. His last two albums, Let
Love Rule and Mama Said, both
received critical acclaim and mass
praise. Both of the albums are
good, but his latest release. Are
You Gonna Go My Way, is excel-
lent. Unlike his past records, the
songs on this album have an older,
wiser feeling to them. He has
matured both as asongwriter anda
performer, and nearly all of the
songs are well-crafted, tight, and
sensitive.

Kravitz is not only a talented
artist but an unusual guy as well.
One look at the pictures in the CD
booklet reveals that Lenny Kravitz

is somewhat eccentric. Most of the
pictures show him draped in some
flamboyant, 1970’s-influenced
outfit— tight sweaters, corduroy
bell-bottoms, platform shoes, or a
huge white fur coat that probably
offends a lot of his audience. —

Once you get past the image,
however, the music speaks for it-
self. Are You Gonna Go My Way
is Lenny Kravitz’s strongest re-
lease to date. Kravitz is a sensitive
song writer whose songs convey
emotion without weakness. The
album is full of strong, intense
music. There are a few melan-
choly songs, but they could never
be described as wimpy. There are
also several tunes that are both
melodic and rockin’ at the same
time.

The album opens with the title
cut, “Are You Gonna Go My Way.”
