Hill Friday Night.

A logical arrangement of subject mat-
ter in the speeches of the first round, a
forceful and convincing delivery, and an
effective rebuttal were the telling factors
in’ Davidson's victory in debate over
Erskine. in the Winthrop Auditorium
last Friday night. Thames and Neai
were in a debating mood and the unani-
mous decision of the judges indicates the
completeness of their victory.

On the other hand, the Erskine repre-
sentatives, R. Caldwell and W. D.
Dickey, while they delivered — good
speeches, failed to show the same sys-
tematic treatment of the subject, the
keen logic and the quotation of definite
authority, as did their opponents. On
rejoinder they failed to touch the main

fute cardinal points advanced by David:
son,

‘The subject debated was: ‘Resolved,
That. the Ship-Purchase Bill. as intro:
duced by Mr. Alexander in the House
of Representatives, January 31, 1906,
should be passed by Congress.” Erskine
argued the affirmative, and Davidson the
negative.

The first speaker on the affirmative.
R. Caldwell, showed the need oof a
stronger merchant marine, and claimed
that we had waited fifty vears in’ vain
for private capital to furnish adequare
merchant ships. He also argued that a

government marine was needed as a
naval auxiliary.
Davidson's first speaker, J. A

Thames, argued that the Alexander Ship
Purchase Bill was inexpedient, imprac
ticable and unnecessarvy—inexpedient its
a means of upbuilding the auxiliary
branch of the Navy, because the ships
provided would be unsuitable far such
purposes; impracticable because it ignores
and utterly fails to remove the funda
mental causes for the decline of aur mec
chant marine; unnecessary because there
is no lack of shipping facilities to handle
American commerce.

The last speaker for the affirmative.
W. D, Dickey, of Erskine, stressed the
point that, eliminating all other plans
for the upbuilding of a merchant marine.
the proposition of the affirmative was the
best and only means for rehabilitating
He argued that
our need for ships was so imperative that.
the government should not hesitate to
operate them, even at a financial loss.

Davidson's second speaker, W.  H.
Neal, argued forcefully the following
points against the Alexander Bill: It
was against the principles of democracy ;
it would be a dangerous policy at pres-
ent; government merchant marine could
be run only at a financial loss; it would
hurt private enterprise: the small num-
ber of ships which it would furnish
would seem ridiculous in view of the
large number required: and in conclus-
ion he submitted another plan for the
upbuilding of our merchant marine.

On rebuttal Davidson used keen logic
and definite authority to fine effect in
answering the somewhat general state-
ments of the Erskine debaters.

Winning Streak.

RICH MOND GAME,

In a close and interesting game Dav-
idson defeated Richmond College ‘Vhurs-
day by the score of 4 to 3, making the‘
fifth straight victory for the season.

Lawson pitched good ball throughout
the game and was seldom in danger.
Joliffe, who started in the box for Rich-
mond, was not very effective and his
support was bad. Three errors and a
single by Alford netted Davidson two
runs in the first inning. Knight  re-
placed Joliffe in the third, but retired in
favor of Cox in the fifth, after two runs
had been added off his delivery. Cox,
who had pitched the day before against
A. & M., was in great form and held his
opponents without a run) for the re-
mitinder of the game. Only one hit was
garnered off ‘his delivery during the
four innings he worked.

Pitt's triple. and Craven's single gave
the Virginian’s ane run in the second.
In the seventh Croswell and Craven sin-
vled in succession and a wild throw by
Black enabled them to score twa more
runs,

The feature of the game was the stick-
work of the opposing catchers, | Each
got three hits during the course of the
gune, which were largely responsible for
the runs made. Black's triple and Law-
son's single completed the umber of
hits secured by Davidson. “The fielding
honors of the day go to third-baseman
Pitt, of the visitors.

Richmond O10 a00 200—-3 6 5

WOFFORD GAME,

The Varsity continued its winning
streak by easily defeating Wofford Mon-
day afternoon 1 to 3, ina slow and one-
sided game. Lawson kept his opponents
guessing at all times and allowed only
five scattered hits. For the first three
innings Eaddy, on the mound for Wof-
ford, had the Davidson batters at his
mercy, but during the rest of the time
he was in the box he was hit freely, Outz
took his place in the cighth inning and
was a little more effective, but errors bv
his team-mates, coupled with two sin-
gles, gave Davidson four more runs.
The fielding of the Wofford team was
unsteady, errors paving the way for
many of Davidson's runs.

Johnson was the particular star with
the stick. getting a triple and a double.
For Wofford, Osbourne and Wiggins di-
vided hitting honors. getting two singles
each. Cauthen, Wofford’s third base-
man, put up a pretty fielding game, ac-
cepting ten chances without an error.

Captain Alford caught a good game,
and his deadly pee was in evidence on
many occasions. He had the misfortune
to iniure his knee in sliding home in the
eighth, and will probably be kept out of
the game for a few days.

Score by innings: R.
