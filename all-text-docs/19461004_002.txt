Throughout our land today, we find groups

were founded. These people, our bitterest
enemies, often disguise themselves with
names which will and have trapped many sin-

but have enlarged the store so that it far
surpasses anything which we have called
a student store in past years. It is need-

It is customary with many news-

papers, including such famed
tribunals as the Christian Science
Monitor, the Gastonia Daily Gazette
and the Davidson News-Leader, to
seclude the name of their respective
editors to a small section in fine
print at the bottom of the editorial
Not with the David-
sonian. At least not so with this
year’s Davidsonian, for our editor
for the current semester, E. Col-
mery “Trouthead” Sutton, When

full scale head and, with'a face like
that, is necessarily bold.

page. so

But, who is this man Sutton? To
look at him casually you’d think he
was an ordinary fellow ... or fish.
That would be your initial error, for
he is not of the commonplace. First
of all he is a* journalist, and all
journalists have an air of the zany
and odd about them.

The Trout’s first indication of
journalistic leanings came at the
age of nine, when littel Eddie dem-
onstrated newly acquired literary
talents by drawing, in chalk and
on the sidewalk in front of his
school, some short but explosively
descriptive words about his teach-
ev’s background. These leanings
developed rapidly, and reached their
zenith Sut’s freshman year at D.C.,
when he composed a sparkling in-
terview with the double-dipping,

double - dealing, double - chinning
manager of the College Pharmacy
. not to mention any names.

The Great Editor came to David-
son by mistake. , Being a_ little
green and a Georgia boy, Sut got
confused in the mammoth Charlotte
bus depot, and thought he was buy-
ing a ticket for N. C. State. He
fell inthe Phi Delt bear trap in
front of the old pest office and so
decided to give up Plowing 21-22
for the local culture.

Not many of his fellow students
knew the Trout during his frosh
term. Sut roomed, at. large, in
Rumple and didn’t show himself
after the initial fall frost until the
warm re of the spring sun
brought forth the ancient dwell-
ing’s occupants. Sut shared a sin-
gle room with two rats, seven cock-
roaches and a senior from Hunters-
ville.

After the war, however, this
Wildcat. Horace Greeley was well
known and his talents sufficiently
appreciated for him to be elected
last spring as the Davidsonian
editor. There are many more un-
usual facts about Trouthead (this
name was bestowed upon him by
a stray ichthyologist from Morgan-
ton.) But they probably wouldn’t
get by the censor (Sutton). So if
you want to learn more of this man,
come by the Davidsonian office on
Monday night and get on speaking
terms with the chief. What a good
fellow he is!
