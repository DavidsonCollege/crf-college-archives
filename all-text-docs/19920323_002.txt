Congressman Rose
Honored By Davidson
For Lifetime Achievements

By Tom Koonce

In a time when the House of
Representatives is experiencing
almost daily negative press and
increased public criticism for
problems such as the recent con-
troversy involving its bank and
post office, Congressman Charles
G. Rose, a 1961 Davidson College
graduate, will be honored by his
alma mater for his exemplary ac-
complishments in the twenty years
he has served as a member of
Congress. Rose’s numerous
achievements as a congressman'

seta fine example of the appropri-

ate way for an elected official to
administer his duties while in of-
fice.

Rose has served as the Repre-
sentative from North Carolina’s
Seventh District since 1972. He
will return to Davidson on Mon-
day to receive the Dean Rusk Pro-
gram Award for Citizen Service.
This presentation ceremony and a
speech by Rose entitled “The Role
of NATO in the New World Or-
der” will be held at 8 p.m. in the
900 Room .

Upon graduation from
Davidson, Rose attended law
school at UNC-Chapel Hill and
then entered into practice in Raleigh
with Senator Terry Sanford. He
also served as chief district court
prosecutor for the 12th judicial
district in his hometown of Fay-
etteville, NC.

_ The award that Rose will re-
ceive on Monday. recognizes out-
standing accomplishment in the
. international area. Rose was re-
cently elected to the position of

' president of the North Atlantic
Assembly, a parliamentary group

of legislators from NATO coun-
tries. According to Rose, recently
“the North Atlantic Assembly has
turned its efforts toward helping
the new parliaments in eastern and
central European countries. We’ ve
made the parliamentarians from
these countries associate members
of the North Atlantic Assembly to
try and help them learn how to set
up their parliaments and especially
how to deal with the military es-
tablishment from a civilian point
of view.”
According to the Charlotte Ob-
server Rose “carries more clout
than any other N.C. lawmaker.”
Rose serves as chairman of the

' House Administration Committee,

a position he described as “the
city-manager’s office of Con-
gress.” This committee manages
the inner functions of the House,
dealing with such things as cam-
paign finance reform. As a result
of holding this post, he will also
head up a task force to investigate
problems with the House post of-
fice.

Rose is also chairman of the
agriculture committee’s subcom-
mittee on tobacco and peanuts and
serves on the subcommittee: on
cotton, rice and sugar and the sub-
committee on livestock, dairy and
poultry. He was also the primary
person involved in getting the
House of Representatives compu-
terized and was founder of the
policy group on information and
computers of the committee on
House administration.

Medical Humes Speaker,Sweetzer, Dis-
cusses Religion, Medicine in Pakistan

By Jeff Oller

On Tuesday March 18, Dr.
Anne Sweetzer spoke about heal-
ing power in Pakistan in the con-
tinuing medical humanities series.
Sweetser is a professor at Con-
necticut College and a Harvard
scholar of anthropology and
Middle Eastern studies who has
lived among the Islamic in the
mountainous region of northern
Pakistan.

She introduced the concept of
a plural medical system. The idea
that people have three main meth-
ods of how to treat illnesses, dis-
eases, and injuries. The first and
earliest method is healing by magic.
The second is religious healing.
This is the basic healing method in
the holistic Pakistani Islamic cul-
ture.

Pakistanis believe in religious
healing, religious health, and the
idea that healing power is a moral
and religious force. The third
method involves the usage of sci-
entific medicine. Western medi-
cine, as itis called, is held as highly
suspect and is used in conjunction
with religious healing in a plural
medical system. Western medi-
cine is often misunderstood and

underestimated as strong herbs.
Sweetser defined and ex-
pressed interest in the necessity of
explanatory models; models that
explain the mind. For the Islamic
in this instance the primary ex-
planatory model revolved around
religion. Sweetser stated, “Reli-

.gion helps them make choices

concerning other medicine.”

Sweetsera extended her lec-
ture to the importance of health
and cleanliness in Islamic society.
In Islamic society, purity is seen as
half of the faith. According to
Sweetser, “All knowledge that is
worthwhile to the follower of Is-
lam is beleived to come from Al-
lah.” Health is seen as the most
precious of treasures given by
Allah. Illness is said to be sent by
Allah to purify. Anyone that has
suffered has justified his entrance
into paradise.

Nursing the sick is seen as re-
ligious duty. A nurse’s responsi-
bility in an Islamic society involves
praying for the afflicted as well as
feeding and caring for the afflicted.
A nurse in Islamic society is seen
as blessed.

Initially Pakistanis practiced
prophetic medicine. No excess of

any pleasures, watch diet, take
honey every once in a while to
purify the body and bloodletting
were standard allowed rules.
Branding and cauterization were
two methods disallowed.

Women are viewed as unclean
in Islamic society. The touch of a
woman, her menstrual fluid,.and
the urine of a baby girl require
immediate ablutions} while. the
urine of a baby boy, for instance,
requires only a sprinkling of holy
water.

Sweetser maintained that she
herself was viewed with suspicion
by the society that she chose to live
with. Infact, women wereinitially
afraid to speak to her until allowed
by theirhusbands. She was seenas
a symbol of the Western culture
that the Islamic view as indecent.
She had to prove herself moral and
was actually seen, after a time,
with a certain amount of religious
status.

Sweetser concluded her
speech by asserting her continuing
interest in the graduation of Is-
lamic religious healing to modern
scientific methods.

Lake Campus Receives Improvements

By Jeff George
While students and teachers

are hard at work in the classrooms, - -

the people who maintain the lake
campus have been working to make
it a more attractive place for stu-
dents and faculty alike.
“Basically, we just wanted to
make the place more aesthetically
pleasing, better to look at when
you come down to the lake,” said
Lee Jones, one of the caretakers.
“You'd really have to come out
and see it to appreciate everything

-we’ve done.”

The changes include cleaning
of the barbecue grillesand removal
of rocks from the beach, repairing
or replacing of signs, moving ca-
noes and boats to a more acces-
sible location, and adding a series
of nature and walking trails around
thecampus. Other projects, which
will extend into the summer, will
add sand volleyball courts and a

complete frisbee-golf course to the
list of renovations.

Jones attributes this surge of
restoration in part to an increase in
the enrollment in water-sport
classes offered by the school. Also,
many people in the Davidson
community feel that the lake cam-
pus should be enjoyed by more,
especially members of the faculty
and staff. Jones views the campus
as “a release, a place where you
can go to study, or just sit back and
unwind.”

In addition to the offerings for
the College, there will be a series
of 2-week summer camps at the
lake this year for rising 5th through
9th grade students. For $65 per
week, children can come and learn
various water sports hands-on. The
camps will be supervised by a 14-
person staff that will be open to
Davidson students as well as other
summer help. Applications can be

obtained from Ron Morrow in the

. Aquatics Departmentor Lee Jones

at the lake campus.

Above all, the lake campus is a
place where all members of the
Davidson community can go to
have fun. Likewise, the effort to
upgrade the lake campus’ facilities
has been a community-wide one,
with members of the Athletic
Departmentand the grounds-keep-
ing staff helping out. According to
Jones, the best thing about the new
changes is that “this is like the
Davidson Family pitching together
to make the ‘other side’ of the
campus look better.”
