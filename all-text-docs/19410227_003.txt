program was. concerned= with
discussion of “The End of National-
ism,” led by Casey Jones

The basic idea for “The End
Nationalism” was taken from an ar-
ticle by Ghristian Gauss. This idea
was that four great nations, the
United States, England, Germany,
and France, had united cul
turally, technologically,
nomically. All enjoy same
kinds of music, art, and books. Also
these natioM® have joined in the de-

the

eco-

velopment’ of Medicine and the
physical sciences. Thus we have
been brought together by such in-
ventions as the radio; — telephone,
telegraph, and other means of com
munication. All geographical bar-
riers have been destroyed. . The

one remaining need for union was
a political one. It was supposed
that these nations were trying, to
“buck the floor of history” in both
the past and present World wars
by fighting on Old World prin-
ciples. The principle closing point
was that the time will come inev-
itably when these nations, already
so closely united, will form
manent and firm union that is based
on co-operation
