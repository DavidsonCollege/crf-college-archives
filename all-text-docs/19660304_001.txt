Ticket Controversy
Remains Unsolved

By JOHNNY CLARK
Davidsonian Associate Editor

College President D. Grier
Martin remained unwilling to
comment this week on the cur-
rent basketball ticket contro-
versy, in which Athletic Direc-
tor Tom Scott has designated the
President and administration as
the authorities enabling the
ticket office to charge students
for admission to Coliseum bas-
ketball games.

Despite Scott's assertion to
THE DAVIDSONIAN two weeks
ago that the President approved
‘in’ November his proposal to
charge students for games in
February, a policy not made pub-
lic until] February, and that the
only source of authority in ticket
arrangements is the administra-
tion, not the Faculty Athletic
Committee. Martin declinéd to
support or refute the ticket pol-
icy. choosing only to issue a
statement through his office that
“he is certainly aware of the

situation and is hoping to do
something about it this spring."

Dr. Paul. Marrotie, chairman
of the Faculty Athletic Commit-
tee, stated to THE DAVIDSON-
IAN previously that although the
faculty committee cannot set
ticket prices, the committee over
the past three years “has ap-
proved the schedule and the
number of games at the Coli-
seum in return for the granting
of good seating and free admis-
sion to students while school is
in session.”

The jurisdiction dispute should
be partially clarified at the fac-
ulty meeting Tuesday, when a
Trustee report, entitled ‘An
Analysis And Clarification Of
The Duties And Responsibilities
Of Various Agencies Of David-
son College For The Physical
Education Of The Student,” will
be presented to the faculty.

The report assigns to the col-
lege president and the Trustees
ultimate responsibility for ath:

Social Council Plans
Friday Night Activity

The Social Council will spon-
sor some sort of Friday night
activity next week in conjunc-
tion with the concert weekend
activities.

‘There definitely will be some
sort of social function, but the
exact nature: will depend on a
variety of factors.” C. Shaw
Smith, College Union director,
told THE DAVIDSONIAN today.

All plans are being worked

around the assumption that the/

basketball team will be playing
in the Eastern Regionals Fri-
day night, Smith said.

The main determining factor
of the Regionals, Jrvine Will-
ing, Social Council treasurer,
said today, is the game time.
“There will be two games, but
we have no way of knowing
whether we'll be playing in the
first game, starting at 7 p.m.,
or the second, at 9 p.m.”

Smith explained that the na-
ture of the activity would de-
pend on which game was to be

the first game, time would re-
main for a more ambitious pro-
gram.

Several campus personalities
who have figured prominently in
the fraternity evaluation express-
ed cautious support this week for
the faculty's recent action adopt-
ing second. semester rush and
100 per cent affiliation.

“This will be a fine thing. as-
suming it works out as it is
planned.’ commented Dr. D.
Grier Martin, president of the
college. “‘The new plans correct
some parts of our system which
need attention.”

“TI think that the proposals
passed by the faculty committee
are workable,” said Tom Cov-

played; should the team play in| ington, fraternity liaison officer

letics, designates the role of the
Athletic Council as advisory,
and lists as the responsibflities
of the Faculty Athletic Commit-
tee the following:

“‘a, They shall ascertain and
approve the eligibility of stu-
dents engaged in intercollegiate
athletics.

‘tb. They are to-work with the
Director of Athletics and ap-

prove the schedule for intercol-|.

legiate contests.

‘‘e, They shall serve in a liai-
son capacity between the Ath-
letic Department and the facul-
ty.”

This clarification was request-
ed by the faculty committee two
years ago and drafted by the
Trustees last spring.

Dr. Marrotte this week ex-
pressed confidence that the tick-
et matter will be settled in meet-
ings this spring. “with an equit-
able solution for all parties con-
cerned.”

The dispute on location of seats
for students is no longer an is-
sue. as Scott has indicated his
willingness to THE DAVIDSON-
IAN that students’ Coliseum
seats next year be located in
center sections of the circle and
mezzanine. with no seats in the
balcony, the end zones or the
poorly located sections D, E, K
and L, which are the corner sec-
tions of the Coliseum.

NUMBER TWENTY

Victory Steals Onto Campus

By ARCH McCALLUM
Davidsonian Asst. Sports Editor

It had happened. It had
really happened. The long
overdue Wildcats had final-
ly won the Southern Con-
ference Tournament.

A triumphant Lefty Driesell
and his charges had cut the nets
from their fastenings. Jubilant
Davidsonians and proud Charlot-
teans pushed their ways onto
the playing surface. People had
shouted and clapped and cheer-
ed.

When it was over, some just
sat back and relaxed with satis-
fied grins on their faces.” OI
Lefty even lit up a long. green
stogie.

On Saturday. Feb. 26. 1966, at
10:15 p.m., the Charlotte Coli-
seum was pure bedlam; it was
a madhouse of not-quite-sure-it-
was really-true Wildcat lovers,

As for the village, the home
of the new champs. remarkably

- little was changed. There was
‘ no celebration Saturday night or

Sunday or any other time. There
was no honking of horns, no
toilet paper-festooned trees and
no noise in the dormitories.

It was a typically dead David-
son weekend. Several Charlotte
newsmen came to town Sunday,
apparently expecting to find the

‘ place half-burned down from the

celebration. They found nothing.
Not even the fourth floor of East
Dormitory had gone to the trou-
ble to put oul so much as a sign
of congratulation.

For two years the community
—college folk and townspeople
alike—had prepared for this mo-
ment. For two years banners
had been hoisted across Main
Street and in shop windows.

Enthusiasm had been un-
quenchable and a confident ex-
pectancy had pervaded the at-
mosphere. For two years the
banners and enthusiasm and ex-
pectancy had melted into the
dreariness of cold Friday nights.

Mrs. Belle Banks, news editor
of the Mecktenburg Gazelte, ex-.
plained why the town had ap-
parently been oblivious to the
coming tournament.

Vince Foster, a junior from
Hope, Ark., was elected chair-
man of the Social Council for
the coming year.

In the balloting held Tuesday,
he won over Bill Kendrick by a
vote of 271 to 160. Previously
Foster held the position of pub-
licity chairman of the Social
Council.

Foster stated that the Social
Council under his leadership will
continue to operate -in basically
the same manner as it has this
year, but that there will be some
changes in the activities.

He stated the need for more
frequent social functions during
the first semester. These would
be planned to coincide particu-
larly with home football games.

The emphasis during the sec-
ond semester will be on fewer,
but bigger social functions. A

want any of the fanfare as in
other years,” Mrs. Banks said.
“That's why there wasn’t any
banner across the street or any
signs in the windows. He didn't
want anything that would asso-
ciate this year with the two prior
ones.”

Meanwhile, the campus was
gloating quietly about the vic-
tory. The same calmness that
had followed last year's defeat
was everywhere apparent, de-
spite the exciting finish of the

sophomore-dominated squad.

There was much more interest
in the future than in the °Cat's
recent accomplishments. Such
faraway and unheard of teams
as Rhode Island and Connecticut
assumed paramount importance.
Immediate plans were made for
the Jong trip to Philadelphia to
see the team perform in the first
round of the NCAA Eastern Re-
gionals.

Bill Bondurant, Director of
Alumni Affairs, announced plans

to charter buses, one leaving
Sunday and one on Monday, for
the Monday night game in Phii-
adelphia.

*‘We've received around 25 in-
quiries from alumni about the
buses.. We also hope to take the
pep band and as many students
as want to go. Alumni response
to the sale of tickets has been
outstanding. They've sold about
400, Most of the alumni are go-
ing by plane or train.”

As the time draws nearer the

pitch is becoming feverish. Ask-
ed about student feeling toward
the tournaments, Pete Glidewell
commented, “I'm excited. This

js a new experience for this

place; people really don't know
how to feel.”

It’s 15 days until the night in
College Park. Md., where the na-
tional champion will be chosen.
Who knows? Maybe there’s a
chance yet for some bonfires
and horn-honking and toilet pa-
per-festooned trees.

Faculty May Eliminate

PROPOSAL

Spring Frolics}Classes

The faculty Academic Sched-
uling Committee recommended
this week that Saturday classes
during Spring Frolics weekend
next month be eliminated.

Paul Marion, student repre-
sentative to the committee, made
the proposal to the group after
noticing that this semester had
one extra day of classes sched-
uled.

Marion received the endorse-
ment of the Student Council
Wednesday after mentioning the
idea. to them.

“The committee was very re-
ceptive to the idea,”’ Marion stat-
ed after the meeting yesterday,

The committee’s suggestion
will go to the faculty for ap-
proval next week at its March
meeting.

Dr. John C. Bailey Jr., a mem-
ber of the committee, pointed out
that the recommended change
was not setting a precedent for
the years ahead. “We approved
the change this year only be-
cause of the extra day of class:
es which appeared in the sched-
{ ule for this semester,”’ he stated.
{ The committee also discussed

money will be spent second se-
mester than during the first, ac-
cording to Foster.

The block booking technique
is one method which Foster
hopes. will. bring some bigger
features to the campus. The
block booking technique works
by having at least two schools
in the general area book the
same groups for consecutive ap-
pearances. This enables each
school to have the act at a low-
er price than for a single, iso-
lated appearance.

Foster emphasized that he
wants ‘‘entertainment more rep-
resentative of student body
tastes." This is to be the pri-
mary goal of the Social Council.
This April, before Spring Frol-
ics, a student body poll will be
conducted to determine the en-
terlainment most desired for
Homecoming next year.

faculty’s action to the trustees; state and national government

and assistant dean of students.
“They were passed in an effort
to alleviate certain problems
which exist in the whole area of
fraternity affairs.”

Dr. W. G. McGavock, who last
year chaired the Fraternities,
Clubs and Social Life Commit-
tee of the faculty, pointed to the
provision for second semester as
a big improvement. He also not-
ed that there is little or no fac-
ulty opposition to freshmen eat-
ing at the College Union for the
entire year. This proposal was
originally made some years ago
by President Emeritus John R.
Cunningham.

All three mentioned the air of
experimentation that surrounds

the approval of the recent pro-
posals.

“It is a difficult thing to be
sure how far to go in changing
what has been better than simi-
Jar systems in other institutions,”
Martin explained. ‘I think there
has been a considerable amount
of surprise that Davidson is
making changes in a system that
has apparently worked well.”

‘l feel that this is another
step in a process of experimen-
tation that we hope is going to
lead to the best possible sys-
tem,” McGavock summarized.

He pointed out that the chang-
es made last year have answer-
ed certain questions concerning
such areas as the academic in-

volvement of freshmen during
the first semester, He said he is
confident that the changes made
this year will no doubt answer
more questions about the situa-
tion.

“We've simply got to experi-
ment and see whether we are
right or wrong,"’ McGavock con-
cluded.

Covington echoed these senti-
ments when he said, “If we find
in the future that these are not
the best solutions to the prob-
lem, I hope the faculty will be
as willing to consider alternate
approaches.”

When asked about the possi-
bility of trustee intervention into
the faculty action, Martin said
that he would have to report the

the possibility of eliminating all
Saturday classes, scheduling
spring holidays to include Eas-
ter, and holding first semester
examinations before Christmas
holidays.

The whole idea of the academ-
ic schedule is being studied by
the Curriculum Committee, ac-
cording to Dean of-Faculty Fron-
tis W. Johnston.

YAF Chairman
Attacks NSA

By HEYWARD CARTER
Davidsonian Feature Writer
Last night the Student Union

was the scene of a much live-
lier than usual Open End dis-
cussion.

The speaker was Tom Huston,
national chairman of the Young
Americans for Freedom, law

diana and author of the pam-

Huston appeared on behalf of

tee, a group set up to promote
the abolishment. of the National
Student Association on member
campuses. Schools in this area
which Huston claims to have
persuaded to withdraw from
NSA. include Duke; UNC-G and
Pfeiffer College.

Huston gives.as his reason for
advocating the abolishment of
NSA on American campuses the
fact that NSA deos not have the
right to represent the student
community for which it claims
it speaks, and that, furthermore,
it does not represent this com-
munity faithfully.

It can not represent the stu-
dent political concerns, says
Hutson, because “‘there js no
such thing as student political
concensus. NSA operates on an
enormous assumption that it rep-
resents the concensus of opin-
ion of American students."

According to Huston, the NSA
was set. up to provide student
Jeadership for its member col-
leges, but it has turned out that
‘student leadership in this coun-
try has been totally ignored by
the NSA.”

Most of the proposals brought

F i{;up in NSA conventions have a

‘purely political basis, voted on
by student representatives who
are poorly informed, for the
most part, on the issues under

time to influencing legislators,
he said. But in 1964-1965 a full

Council
Sets
No Date

The student body will vote in a

_ referendum next week on wheth-

er Davidson should remain a
member of the National Student
Association.

Joe Beard, representing an
ad hoe committee opposing con-
tinued affiliation with NSA, pre-
sented to the Student Council
Monday night a petition calling
for a referendum.

Student Body President Bill
Council set no definite date for
the vote, but said it would be
held next week sometime, prob-
ably Tuesday or Wednesday.

Dave Lewis, a sophomore and
a primary organizer of the ‘‘Stop
NSA” Committee, stated that the
main point of the movement was
to save money. Lewis said that
“NSA is neither representing nor
benefiting the student body.’’ Ac-
cording to Lewis, dues to the
association are $50 yearly, ‘‘and
its merits .are questionable.”

POWELL

At the Council meeting, Dave
Powell voiced his opposition to
such an early referendum since
“the (Stop NSA) Committee
would have great momentum,
and results of such a referen-
dum might not be a true, or even
fair indication of student opin-
fon."*

Powell also .mentioned that
Chuck Matthews, student body
vice president currently studying
in Washington, was an ardent
advocate of NSA and should be
consulted before any referendum
is held.

Council said that Matthews had
already been contacted.

Beard also reported plans for
the. Open End discussion, held
last night, at which Tom Hous-
ton. chairman of the national
Stop NSA Committee, spoke.

VESPERS

In other Council proceedings,

‘a Statement concerning Vespers

alterations was presented by
Jim Timmons, chairman of the
Student Council Committee on
Religious Life.

The statement presented two
proposals meant to strengthen
the Vespers program. The first
proposal was to cut the Vespers
requirement-in half, thereby in-
suring. capable speakers. Second-
ly, it was suggested that the
number of Vespers and chapel
cuts be combined to remove the
compulsory nature of church at-
tendance.

Timmons reported that he has
attempted to contact President

D. Grier Martin about the state-
ment. Timmons plans to present
the proposals to the Faculty Re-
ligious Life Committee at an up-
caming meeting.

ELECTIONS

Lee Fanning, chairman of the
Student Council Elections Com-
mittee, announced that students
needing absentee ballots should
come by his room.
