The Connells performed at Richardson Field during Spring Frolics.

Frolicking with
The Connells

By VIRGINIA MISCHEN

The forecasters predicted 30de-
grees, but the crowd of approxi-
mately one thousand found on the
football field last Saturday night
didn’t let the temperature stop
them. They danced the chillsaway
to the sound of the Connells any-
way.
For about 90 minutes, the Con-
nells played the rollicking music
which has popularized them
among college students in the
Southeast and which has brought
them national acclaim.

They started out with the title
cut to Fun & Games.and went on to
play music from their other two
albums—Boyland Heightsand Darker
Days--as well. Tunes included
“Uninspired”, “I Suppose”,
“Choose a Side”, and “Home To-
day”, as well as crowd favorites
“Saturday Nite (USA)” and “Up-
side Down”.

“Fun!” appeared to be the
generalconsensus from thecrowd.
Many students clustered near the

stage, dancing and singing along.
Other people took a more mello
route, bundling upinblanketsand
enjoying the free coffee provided
by the Union.

If. “fun and games” weren’t
enough, people also had the op-
portunity to exercise their social
consciences by buying one of the
band’s t-shirts supporting Habitat
for Humanity.

When the group attempted to
conclude their performance, noone
wouldlet them. Audienceenthusi-
asm convinced them to play two
encore sets of three songs each.
After all, how could they have
ended without playing “Scotty’s
Lament” and “Elegance”?

The Connells were brought to
Davidson through the efforts of
the Concert Committee and the
Union as part of the annual Spring
Frolics celebration. Few people
could deny that it was a huge suc-
cess.

For those of you who missed
the concert or want to hear more,
the word from Mike Connell’s
mouthis that the group will record
anew album next month.

Annual Student Exhibition an
Enlightening Experience... .

By JENNIFER SIECK

Did youattend a performance
of Hedda. Gabler, catch Saffire - the
Uppity Blues Women, or experi-
ence the Davidson Dance troupe?
Another area in the fine arts is
havinga show oncampus, but this
time it is the visual arts that are
receiving attention. The Annual
Student Exhibition ofartworkison
display now in the Chambers Gal-
lery. The exhibition features art-
work selected from all of the 1989-
90 studio art courses at Davidson.
These are works which vary froma
few inches in size to those a few
feet in size, works-done both in
black and white and in color, and
works representing the mediums
of acrylic, oil, charcoal, oil crayon,
and pencil as well as all of the
techniques of lithography and etch-

ing. Their subject matters,range
from people to places to plants to
planets to the abstract.

Susan Grosse, owner of Grosse
Gallery in Charlotte, served as the
awardsjuror for the exhibition. The
first award went to Christopher
Jones (etching), the second award
to, Mark Barrow (acrylic), and the
third award to Sigrid Cook (litho-
graph). The three persons receiv-
ing honorable mention were Marya
Howell (etching),J.B. Bean (acrylic),
and Briggs Holmes (etching).

I am no art critic, having no
formal and little informal training
in the area of art; however, asource
who chose to remain anonymous
gave me a few- tips: My source
suggested that the students’ works
were judged for quality in execu-
tion in the particular medium
which was used and for subject
matter. The degree of difficulty of
the medium or technique may have

also be takerinto @éerSideration;:
for example, etching is generally:
considered to be a very challeng-
ing, technique with.a high degreé
ofdifficulty. Theseideascouldhave |
factored into the decisions made
about the pieces.

Acouple of pieces whichespe-
cially caught my eye were an etch-
ing of alligators side by side done
by Marya Howell and an acrylic
painting of coats of many colors -
rich fuchsia, purple, royal blue,and
green colors done by Mollie Har-
rington.

I enjoyed the entire exhibition
very much, and | highly recom-
mend that you go check it out for
yourself. You can feast your eyes
and your imagination when look-
ing at these students’ works. You
might even take along an art stu-
dent if you area novice like myself
tohelp you interpret what yousee.

Beer: "Where the Women Are Hot,
and the Beer is Not"

By JOHN HUTCHINSON

Researching this column was
particularly exciting as guest
drinker Prof. Gill Hollandarranged
for his Norwegian in-laws to join
us. Airline captain, Jonny Skaar,
his wife, Inger Lise, and their son,
Bjorn, flew in from Norway to
spenda few daysinDavidson,and
generously offered their expert

opinions on Scandinavian brews;

If Finland is any indication,
beer productioninScandinaviaand
Germany is very similar, as Finn-
ish exchange student Camilla
Makinen relates that various towns
brew their own special beers. Finn-
ish cookbooks, in fact, often in-
clude beer recipes.

Jonny Skaar found theidea ofa
beer column rather intriguing, and
asked “Do you do this for a liv-
ing?” I only wish...

* Carlsberg: Dry, bitter after-
taste. “The flavoris morerich than
Coors or other American beers” -
Bjorn. “I would not put much
volume of this into myself” —Jonny.
“This is the kind of beer you drink
at 11:00 am ina short glass. It has
a nice ozone taste” --Holland.

*Grolsh: Nutty or”Plum taste.
This is an after dinner beer” --Hol-
