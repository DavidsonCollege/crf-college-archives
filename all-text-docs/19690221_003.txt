TOWARD A NEW MORALITY
Kaufmann outlines modern crisis. .

Kaufmann Says Honesty
Is Key To New Morality

By BIFF FINE
Copy Editor
Honesty and respcnsibility
are the cornerstones of a
new morality that is evolving
in our times, according to
Dr. Walter Kaufmann, pro-
fessor of philosophy at
Princeton University.
Kaufmann, a Reynolds
lecturer, presented lectures
Monday night and Tuesday
morning in the Morrison
Room in a series entitled
“The Crisis in Morality.”
In the lecture. “The Birth
Pangs of Honesty.” Kauf-

Asst. Managing Editor
Applications for admission
from Negro students have in-
creased almost 400. percent
from previous years, the
office of admissions said this

week.

H. Edmunds White, .direc-
tor of admissions and finan
cial aid, said that the in-
crease is the result of greater
activity in recruiting from
predominantly Negro high
schools.

“The new recruiting plans
are partly a.response to stu-
dent desires.” he said.
“There has been a lot of in.
terest in diversifying the
student body. As a matter of
fact, many individual stu
dents, on their own, have
been recruiting black pros-
pects."

White said that applica
tions from 23 Negro students
are being considered. ‘I
would say that 12 of these
men will probably be accept-
ed,” he said. ‘Previously.
only six or seven applications
were received from Negroes
per year."

Davidson receives about
1000 applications and accepts
about 150 each year, he said.

“Some of the Negro appli.
cations are totally unrealis-
tic,’ said White. ‘‘but each
individual is being considered
on his own merits and poten-
tial. We don't see any point
in handling black students as
a special group.”

mann designated ambition.
courage, love, and honesty
as determinants of morality.

Kaufmann stressed that he
did not intend to set up a
hierarchy of characteristics,
but added that if one had to
choose between following the
paths suggested by love and
honesty, the choice of hon
esty, though sometimes un-
pleasant, is best.

Although the trend toward
honesty as the basis of
morality has accelerated
greatly in the past century
and is strongly evident in
campus unrest and anti-war
protest today. Kaufmann
pointed out passages from
Micah and Amos in the 8th
century: B.C. which alluded
to honesty.

He attacked the hypocrisy
of religion in the United
States, citing figures from
recent polls taken in this
country and Europe pertain-
ing to the acceptance of tra.
ditional Christian doctrine.

In developing his concept
of honesty, Kaufmann traced
the etymology of the word
integrity over the past 200
years, stressing the fact that
its meaning had evolved the
idea of a unified whole into
that of honesty of thought
and action..

The emphasis placed on
the present by the existen
tialists is one factor contri-
buting to the rise of honesty
as a standard of morality.
according to Kaufmann.

Kaufmann elaborated on
the role of the existentialist
thought in the current change
in moral standdrds in his
second lecture. ‘’Existential-
ism and Responsibility.”

Kaufmann criticized John
Paul Sartre for acting in bad
faith when he accepted the
Marxist interpretation of his
tory. Sartre, whose lecture
“Existentialism is a Human.
ism" introduced the word ex
istentialism in 1946, did an
intellectually unjustified
about face when he embraced
Marxist determinism in 1962.

Modern existentialists be-
lieve, as Jaspers did. that
“boundary situations’ such
as death, despair. dread.
and guilt are the points of
origin for philosophy, ac-
cording to Kaufmann. They
realize as Kierkegaard did
that reason and philosophy
are incapable of leading man
to the though for which he
can live and die, he said.

Chapel Walkout Hits
Worship At Queens

By JULE YOUNG
Staff Writer

An estimated 300 Queens
girls refused to enter the
college's Belk Chapel for
services last Wednesday,
choosing to gather outside
instead.

The boycott was aimed at
the Queens tradition of the
weekly worship service, in
many respects similar to Da-
vidson's once required vesper
service. in which seven cuts
a semester are now allowed.

The boycott was called by
the Queens Christian Asso-
ciation. Miss Mary Marshall,
leader of the group, noted
that many Queens students
felt worship to be an area
not coming under the admin-
istration’s guidelines.

Several girls added that
regardless of the Christian
affiliation of the college, an
enforced worship service
could’ not he justified be-
cause of its hypocrisy.

According to Miss Mar
shall, there is already a
student faculty committee

report on religious life call-
ing for the abolition of com
pulsory chapel services.

The boycott, several girls
noted, is intended to call at-
tention to the committee's

ARTIST SERIES REHERSALS
Miss Kombrink, Welsh prepare for performance.

Miss Kombrink To Sing
‘Songs Of Eve’

Welsh’s

By JOKN ROWE
Staff Writer

The Artist Series will pre-
sent soprano Ilona Kombrink
in Love Auditorium on Mon
day night at 8:15.

The highlight. of her per
formance will be the area
premiere of “Songs of Eve:
by Professor and Mrs. Wil
mer H. Welsh o¥ Davidson.

Accompanied by Arthur
F. Beckwell of the University
of Wisconsin. where Miss
Kombrink teaches music, she
will also sing several Italian
arias, five songs by Hugo
Wolf and contemporary Ital-
ian songs by Francesco San-
toliquido.

Mrs. Welsh wrote the words
for “Songs of Eve,” a cycle
of six songs. while Welsh
composed the music for Miss
Kombrink's voice and piano
accompaniment.

“Songs of Eve" is taken
from Genesis and tells of the
creation, life and death of
Eve.

“It is a cycle of life— one
kind of woman's cycle of

life,” Welsh said.. ‘The story
is tald without supernatural
overtones to make her more
meaningful for the modern
day.

“It is a story of every
woman if you wish to attach
meaningful experiences to
the symbolism.”

According to Welsh, with
the exception of Haydn's
oratorio ‘The Creation,”
which uses the biblical lan.
guage, ‘Songs of Eve" is
the only other musical com-
position he knows which cen-
ters on Eve.

Miss Kombrink has. pre-
viously presented leading or
solo performances in_ this
area in two other works by
Welsh, the oratorio “Joseph”
and his ‘‘Concerto for Voice
and Orchestra.”

Queens girls were joined
in their protest by the Char-
lotte Observer. In an editor-
ial entitled “Enforced Chapel
Risks Emptiness,"’ the news-
paper noted that ‘‘It is axio-
matic that worship can't be
coerced, even though a re-
quirement for student attend
ance at chapel may be en-
forced as a matter of school
policy."*

The Observer's editors rec.
ognized that perhaps a strike
had been chosen without full
consultation of the facts. Yet
the editor, comparing the

Queens problem to that at
Davidson, noted that “It is
questionable whether a great-
er sense of community is be-
ing cultivated when compul-
sory chapel becomes—as it
became at Davidson College
—a display of boredom, re-
sentment and disrespect.”

Action on the problem ap.
peared uncertain this week.
However, it does appear at
present as though the Queens
administration and president,
Dr. John Smylie, will re
examine the chapel require.

AED Consultant
Studies Campus

By STEVE WILLIAMS
News Editor

Dr. Victor L. Butterfield, a
consultant for the Academy
for Educational Develop
ment (AED), met with sev-
eral campus groups this week
on a fact-finding tour.

The AED is a_ nonprofit
corperation which advises
educational and other insti
tutions on ways to improve
operations and to plan for the
future. The group was con-
tracted to make a full-scale
study of Davidson.

Butterfield was president
of Wesleyan College from
1943 until 1966 and has served
as acting president of New
College in Sarasota, Fla.
He is considered to be one of
the top authorities in the na
tion on liberal education.

Dr. Samuel R. Spencer Jr.,
president of Davidson. said
that Butterfield was here
simply to get a preliminary
overview of the college.

He talked to faculty mem
bers, students, and adminis-
trative officers in an attempt
to become familiar with. the
college in general and to
identify some of the principal
concerns of certain groups.

The student group included
Pat Bray. Peter Hobbie.
John Williams, Joe Murphy.
Bob Dunham and Tom Opie.
He talked about several as-
pects of this and other col-
leges with this group.

Dunham said that he’ did
not dwell on any specific
item, but he did praise the
honor system as being one
of the best in the country.

Some of the faculty mem
bers He met with were Dr,
Anthony S. Abbott, Dr. W. G.
McGavock, Dr. Thomas 0.
Pinkerton, and Spencer.

Butterfield is one of sev.
eral consultants who will visit

provide the AED with advice
for their study this year.
The study will he concluded
and recommendations will be
made to the college by, Sept.
1.

Spencer in his inaugural.
address had called on the
college to contract an out-
side agency to help develop
an overall plan for dealing
with such problems as fi.
nancial management and
campus development.

The college administration
decided on AED after con-
sidering offers from several
other agencies.
