Cats hold number three spot,
Still keep NCAA possibility

By BOB HAYMAN

The Davidson baseball
team’s bid for a conference
championship was placed in
jeopardy this past week as the
Wildcats managed only one win
in three conference games.

The Davidson nine also drop-
ped two non-conference
decisions, and their overall
record fell to 14-12. Their con-
ference record now stands at

The week opened April 9 with
Davidson traveling to
Charleston, S.C. for a big game
with league-leading Citadel.
Joel Tew pitched a typically
fine game for the Wildcats as
he held the Citadel to just two
runs.

Unfortunately for Davidson,
it was 2 runs too many as the
Wildcats failed to score against
3 different pitchers. Only
George Weicker, who was 2 for
4, posed any offensive threat as
the Wildcats were shutout for
the second straight game.

On Friday, April 11, David-
son got the hitting it needed as
they racked up 10 runs against
visiting Pfeiffer. Pfeiffer,
however, got 11.

Neither starter.Joe Duncan
nor reliever Dwight Plemmons,
whose .record dropped to 2-3,
could stop the onslaught as
Pfeiffer pounded out 15 hits, the
most collected by an opponent
all year.

On the brighter side, Mark
Rodgman was 3-5 in boosting
his average to .320 while
Weicker also collected three
hits, including his seventh
home run.

Weicker also picked up 3
RBI’s, giving him a league-
leading 32. Ed Willingham also
homered for the Wildcats.

On Saturday the pitching was
better but the result. wasn’t as

Guilford defeated Davidson 5-2. :

-Tim Peck was nailed with his
fourth loss as Davidson hitters
were again throttled.

; _ 8:00 & 10:30 P.M.

Exceptions were Gary
Pomeroy, who _ singled,
doubled, and drilled his fourth
home run, and Weicker who
was 2 for 3.

Davidson travelled’ to
Virginia on Tuesday the 15th
for a crucial doubleheader with
conference rival Richmond.
Davidson won the first game 5-
3, but their hopes for a sweep
were dashed in the second
game as the Wildcats were
trounced 8-0.

In the opener, Davidson got
all the runs they needed in the
first inning as the first four bat-
ters scored. The big hit was
Weicker’s bases-loaded double.

Tim Barr then held Rich-
mond to just six hits en route to
his fifth win in 6 decisions.

The second game was simply
disastrous. Joel Tew, who spor-
ted a 1.70 ERA going into the

game, displayed none of his
usual effectiveness and the
Davidson offense was equally
unspectacular. The result was
an 8-0 loss that crippled David-
son’s chances for a conference
title.

The Wildcat confernece
record of 7-4 is good enough for
third place’ behind 6-1 Cita-
del and 8-3 Furman.

Mathematically, Davidson is
still very much in the running
for the conference cham-
-pionship which would give
them a berth in the NCAA
playoffs.

The Wildcats will play
Catawba on Thursday, then
battle Furman at 2 p.m. on
Saturday in a crucial con-
ference game.

On Monday they travel to
Pfeiffer, then play at South
Carolina on Tuesday, April 22.
