Discussion of Polaroid

Mr. E. H. Land

By SHAW SMITH |
“The Magician, Howard Thur- |
ston, was always writing before his |
death two years ago, trying to get |
permission to use Polaroid,” said}
Mr. George W. Wheelwright, in an)
interview after his interesting lec- |
ture on Polaroid in Chambers atisi|

ditorium last Wednesday night.
“Thurston wanted to use it in con-|
troling light,’ continued Mr. |

Wheelwright, “and said he could}
have shown some of the most ad-!
vanced mystery ever seen in the|
magic world through the use of it.” |

Thus a fascinating inside story,
of Polaroid was brought to light
about control of light. “But we}

ROTC Unit Gets Out

For Freshman Game

The ROTC department at David-
son turned out en masse for the
Davidson-Duke

freshman game

here in Davidson last Friday.

Class of ’29
Graded Best

Davidson's smartest and most
stupid classes graduated in two
consecutive years, according to sta-
tistics released by F. W. Henge-
veld yesterday.

The class having the largest num-
ber of “cum laude” and “summa
cum laude” diplomas awarded in
the last ten years was the class
of 1929, whose number received 38
honors of this kind. The following
year seventeen received diplomas
“cum laude” and four were award-
ed degrees “summa cum laude.”

The class of '37 was the largest
ever to graduate from Davidson
while the class of ‘19 was the
smallest in the last twenty years.
There have been 65 diplomas
awarded “summa cum laude” in the
last ten years, while 252 received
“cum laude” diplomas.

Two thousand forty-nine diplo-
mas have been awarded in the last
twenty years, including nine hun-
dred fifty-nine Bachelor of Science
degrees, seven hundred thirty-three
Bachelor of Arts degrees and forty
Master of Arts degrees,

The next day McLean once more
rose bright and early to do his
daily delving. After several hours
of sifting out a few yellow flakes
he was again plumbing the depths
of despond when his hopes were
sent soaring by the discovery of a
nugget twice the size of a pinhead
and worth almost ten cents. Dave
redoubled his efforts, and as nug-
get followed nugget, his stock rose
steadily; ere evening fell, he had
amassed a fortune of over twenty-

the campus and in Charlotte with
the Spectator’s Club.

WILDCATS CONQUERED Ping attack carried the Wildcats

[Continued from Page Four]

Henson went over the goal for

South Carolina’s first touchdown on|

the second play. The Gamecocks
started another drive after the
kick-off, but the Wildcats took
the ball on downs on their own 36
and started a drive of their own.
Two passes from Davis to Stair put
the ball on the Carolina 25 yard
line, and then Archie Steed, a sub
for Davis, ran to the 12, and thence
to the 3. But the Birds stiffened
and repulsed the attack. Then the
‘Cats grabbed a punt and started
back, but this time Crews, Carolina
end, recovered Steed’s fumble on
his own 15 yard stripe to end the
threat.
Grygo Shines

The second half was all South
Carolina from start to finish. Soon
after the kickoff Grygo broke off
tackle and ran 44 yards to the
Davidson 5, but the Wildcats turn-
ed back this advance when Grygo
passed over the end zone. The
Gamecocks took the ball on downs
on Davidson's 21 when Bill Davis
saw. that his kick would be block-
ed and tried to run. Three plays
later Grygo scored’ the second
touchdown from the 12.

Running plays carried the Game-
cocks the 'Cats’ 31 yard line,
where Clary shot a pass to McMil-
lan on the 12. Then a holding pen-
alty against Davidson put the ball
on the 1, from which Clary went
over for the score.

South Carolina scored again
when McMillan intercepted a pass
and ran to the Davidson 44. Then
the powerful ground attack rolled
into action and swept to the 6
yard line. From whence a pass from
Williams Robinson scored the
final touchdown of the day. How-
ever a desperate last minute pass-
