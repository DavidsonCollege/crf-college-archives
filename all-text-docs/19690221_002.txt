A ‘Revolting’ Situation

The role of opinion is the serious
question.

With the advent of the new editor-
ial “we.” there is naturally the coming
of new ideas and new considerations,
but the role of opinions remains the
essential question. Along with it
comes the question of this publica-
tion in evaluating the aims of the
students which it represents.

In one of the newspaper cartoons
this week an island castaway picked
up a newspaper which had drifted
ashore and said to his companion,
“The newspaper says that the stu-
dents are revolting.” His mate’s reply
was simply, ‘‘Well it’s entitled to its

pinion.”

Certainly there have been times
when THE DAVIDSONIAN’s editors
have found the actions of their con-
temporaries “revolting,” but instead
of expressing this opinion they have
turned frequently to the interest of
the student cause. We have. reached
a point which marks the necessity to
evaluate more completely some of the
causes and their methods of achieve-
ment. We have reached a point now at
which we can question the method-
ology and aims of the student cause.

We have been quite concerned,
perhaps more than most students,
about the evolution of the new action
Davidson. We have taken an interest
in the long and the short range goals
of thé student body, and we have sup-
ported these goals. But there have
been times when we have questioned
motivation and modus operandi of
student desires.

In many ways the Davidson student
body has directed its quest for change
along mature and well-planned chan-
nels. The dissent was well-founded
and directed at necessary amendment
of existing structures.

But there have also been times when
students have spoken too loudly, when
immaturity has overridden good tim-
ing and reason, when impatience has
spoiled qualified concern and when

e students’ own hypocrisy has cast

a shadow on apparently well-aimed
protestations.

It seems that Davidson’s student

body has expressed impatience on is-
sues which required time instead of
voicing protests in areas where some
impatience was necessary to effect
change. Certainly the energy which
was stimulated during the planning
for the recent chapel walkout could
have been rerouted in the area of
admissions policy. And the impatience
over the probable curfew abolishment
could have been applied to Davidson’s
role in extra-campus responsibilities
instead.
_ Recently a few students have shown
that they just don't know when to
quit, and their actions have served
only to prolong the period of time
necessary to effect the reforms they
requested. Their actions may have
swayed a committee or the adminis-
tration to reconsider the rationality
of a change in the rules’ structure.
In these cases impatience has provid-
ed not a short cut, but a roadblock to
any chance of alteration of an undesir-
ed system.

Classroom attitudes and the hypoc-
risy in the expressions of concern dur-
ing rush have also caused a question-
ing on our part of the reliability and
sincerity of student requests for
change. The casual occurrence of
“back scratching” in the reporting of
rush violations and some of the hypo-
critical attitudes toward the Code of
Responsibility seem to contradict the
apparent concern for injustices in
campus regulations and social life.

We have found justifiable cause to
support the revolutionary efforts of
students in the past and will continue
to lend due support to change for the
betterment of the college and the
community, but we will stand as critics
as well as publicists of the student

cause. We make this our aim in an

effort, to aid the revolution for ad-
vancement, while holding to our right
of opinion to express what we feel
is “revolting” and what is not.

The Great Snow Job

While Davidson students wrestled
with the .problem of housing their
dates during the great snow, a second
‘group of Davidsonians were doing an
admirable job of coping with another
major problem brought on by the
great snow.

In a successful effort to reverse last
year’s poor performance, Grover Meet-
ze and the maintenance department
came through with a remarkable show-
ing. in their battle with the snow and
ice on the campus walkways and steps.

As early as Sunday afternoon, while

A Study In

Notice the contrast:

Dean Burts on student conduct
rules: “I do not expect students to be
consulted in the formulation of these
rules.”

President Spencer at his installa-
tion: “I would hope that we will be
able to‘hammer out solutions to our
problems together, not as students
at one corner of the triangle, faculty
and staff at another, and trustees at
another.” .

Or try the contrast between the
faculty constitution, which puts stu-
dent conduct matters into the hands
of a joint student-faculty committee,
and the Dean’s Council, which con-
tains no facull,: members, much less
students, and is rewriting student con-
duct rules behind closed doors.

And for what it’s worth, there’s that
high-sotinding assertion of the stu-
dent Bill of Rights, that academic and
non-academic regulations and educa-
tional policy must be “formulated and
applied with significant student par-
ticipation.”

The Dean’s Council, which has a
parently replaced the Student Life
Committee, has an interesting back-
ground. According to the dean of
students, it was the old Student Life
Committee which the new faculty con-
stitution abolished two years ago. But
it seems that this vestige of the-old
way isn’t going to disappear simply by
the unanimous action of the faculty
and approval of the Board of Trustees
in-voting in that new faculty charter.
No mere scrap of paper is going to
tie the hands of the Dean’s Council.

In fact, not even the combined
opinion of students, faculty, trustees
and the president has had any effect.
Like Moses descending from Mt. Sinai
with the Ten Commandments, this

snow and sleet was still coming down,
department workers were busy with
shovels and plows to clear roadways
and walks..The result has been a min-
imum of injuries due to falls and
slides, whereas last year students risk-
ed numerous injuries due to the ac-
cumulation of ice on paths and side-
walks. Whether or not the prominence
of the weekend had anything to do
with the rapid solution to the icy
problem, the maintenance department
deserves a vote of appreciation for
their efforts.

Contrast

remnant of past times has returned
to bring word of what the dean’s of-
fice by some unknown inspiration
deems to be proper conduct for a Da-
vidson gentleman. And no matter
what the new regulations say, what
is important is that they are really
administration rules, handed down by
edict from an obscure council norm-
ally tucked away in some janitor’s
closet in Chambers basement and pull-
ed out now and again to tell students
how to act.

We can’t help but wonder where
the Dean’s Council picked up its au-
thority to ignore the faculty constitu-
tion, unilaterally rewrite faculty-pass-
ed regulations and defy the president’s
openly stated policy. *

But even more important than this
unwarranted assumption of authority
is the serious problem of expanding an
already wide split between faculty
and students, a division which at worst
leads to a Columbia and at best slows
the educational process.

Davidson College must be one com-
munity, but action like that of the
Dean’s Council only divides. The de-
crees not only approach the student
chapel walkout in irresponsibility —
it’s not just students who can be ir-
responsibie —- but follow from a basic
assumption that 20-year-old men who
have $3,000-a-year invested in a col-
lege education aren't really human
beings capable of rational thought and
ethical reasoning. Rather, the Dean’s
Council would view them as less than
human — as kids, or animals in a zoo.

But then, maybe so. Perhaps the
students here are just kids. Enrolling
in a school in which rules are decreed
in this fashion suggests at least some
lack of wisdom.

“For want of a horse the battle was lost...”

Riner: Is The Student
Senate Being Packed?

ED. NOTE: The following
letter is from the student who
has asked the Court of Ap-
peals to issue a restraining
order against the Senate Ex-
ecutive Committee until cer-
zain constitutional questions
over recent actions of the
SEC have been decided in
the court.

The recent senatorial etec-
tions feft the seats of three
dorm senators vacant. The
SEC then nominated, and the
Senate confirmed, three per-
sons to fill those seats.

Just whether the SEC had
that power, or whether the
Senate has the power to con-
firm them, will be decided
by the court.

To The Editor:

Are senators meant to re-
present the students or noi?
This ‘is the question that I
hold as probably the most
vital issue in the SGA this
year, -

After the action of the SEC
last week appointing dorm
senators for Watts, Cannon,
and Richardson, I don't chink
we can ignore the SEC any
longer, no matter how much
we may like to.

I know well that the opin-
ions of many among us feel

that we should let the Sen-
ate and the SEC do what
they want. but is this right?

The SEC and the Senate
are the executive bodies of
the SGA, and we are the
SGA. As members of the
SGA we should find it our
duty to take an interest.
We have too long ignored
our responsibilities.

‘We have consistantly. left
all the duties of the SGA to
a small few. This has been
the policy for so long that
these few elected students
think that after “they are
elected to office they can
go about their merry way
and do anything as they see
fit.

It ig no wonder that the
faculty is so hesitant to give
away the power (which real-
ly shouldn't be theirs) to the
Senate and the SEC, because
actually they represent the
student body only for a few
days around election day.

The case in question is
not a minor issue. The re-
sidents of Watts. Richard-
son, and Cannon are in dan-
ger of losing their represent-
ation on the Senate.

I am not questioning the
abilities of the men appoint-

ed by Peter Hobbie and the
SEC. What I am question-
ing is whether senators are
representatives of the stu-
dents or rubber stamps for
the president of the student
body.

Students of Davidson Col.
lege have already lost too
much jurisdiction to the fa-
culty. Are we going to let
the rest of it slip through
our fingers and into the
hands of a few young men
with the name of the SEC?

Bryan Criticizes
Social Reformers

To The Editor:

It becomes ever clearer
that one question alone can
agitate the mind and spur
the “conscience.” such as it
is, of the gentlemen of this
college. It is not the high
matter of war and peace
which agitates their mind.
not the search for God. or
at least for temporal justice.
nor even common decency.

Rather it is that mundane
and hackneyed question of
fraternities, I am glad that
there is no matter of great
er importance for gentlemen
to meddle with. If there
were, the result might be
useful to contemplate.

The hope of an impartial
opinion in this case is well
nigh forlorn. Persons who
are members of fraternities
are either convinced of their
sublime right to conduct the
fraternities as they please.
or elsé have been taught
somehow ‘to believe that
very existence is an offense
to Goe or, what is worse.
democracy.

Persons who are not mem-
pers of fraternities almost
to a man regard them with
a distaste which all too often
lapses into disgust.

Consequently, it seems to
me that someone should of-
fer a (more or less) unpre-
judiced view on the subject.
And for that ‘reason, al-
though it is none of my affair
— and let all remember
that — I venture the last
extremity and write a letter
to THE DAVIDSONIAN
which, I call all the saints
to witness, I would not do
were matters otherwise.

I wish to refer specifically
to the remarks of Mr. Todd
Hobbie and Mr. Berkley
Latimer, quoted in this news-
paper last week. Both of
these gentlemen exhibit
tremendous lack both of
judgment and of taste, as
well as almost total blind-
ness,

I note that Mr. Hobbie is
quoted as having said that
in the fraternities, Davidson
College countenances an ‘‘ex-
clusivist’ system. I believe
that the meaning is clear,
although the word ‘‘exclusi-

guage. tends to obscure the
sefise. .

Nonetheless. I imagine that -
anyone knowing Mr. Hob
bie’s education and procli-
vities would accept the
statement. and, if he shared
those. proclivities, even en
dorse it. However, Mr. Hob
bie has fatally weakened
his argament by enrolling in
Davidson College. for it is
by the very nature of the-
word exclusive, an ‘‘exclusi. |
vist’ system. At least it ts
harder than Hell to get in
lo.

That is no doubt one rea
son why he chose te come
here rather than the Uni
versity of Arkansas. We will
grant that the fraternities
are exclusive. But we will al-
so declare that not only they.
but all of society is equally
exclusive.

Any man who chooses
another for his particular

“friend excludes some third.

Shall I be insulted because
I was the third? In fact.
have I myself not done the
same thing?

But even were I disposed
to concede to Mr. Hobbie's
complaint, I should be forc-
ed to take exception to the
one ascribed to Mr. Latimer.
He maintains that the fra-
ternities ‘‘dehumanize”’ their
members. This is utterly of
fensive, a wholly gratuitous
insult directed toward the
greater part of his school
mates,

Furthermore, this is a
point which I shall not trou
ble to refute. I will, how.
ever, suggest that if either
some several hundred men
or lone Berkley Latimer is
inhuman, the _ statistical
chances seem to indicate the
latter possibility.

What I mean to say is
that Latimer seems to con
sider members of fraterni-
ties inhuman because they
are different from him. Un-
less he is in fact the image
of humanity. his judgment
is fallacious.

Finally, I read that both
Mr. Hobbie and Mr. Thomas
Opie are of the opinion that
fraternity houses might pro
fitably be used as eating
clubs. This is almost as of.
fensive as Mr. Latimer's
statement. What it signifies
is simply that these people.
wish to take possession of
what is, in effect, the pro-
perty of someone else.

This is the true reason for
all the attacks on fraterni-
ties: you have something I
don’t have, and if I can't
have one too, I'll break
yours,

This attitude is worthy only
of the dog ‘in the manger.
not of supposedly mature
and responsible Christian
gentlemen.

Second Thoughts On Co-Education

Ah, Hysteria, Thou flower of the arts. Who

would now deny Thy rightful place among
the most scholarly high priests of academe.
Surely your. spirit has of late found a rest-
ing place here among the magnolias.

I speak, of course, of Thy recent captiva-
tion of teachers and pupils with visions of
young maidens floating amongst them —

eautiful, exceeding intelligent, sparking all
to higher and better achievements.

But if I may be so bold, I would like to
confide in you my apprehensiveness in re-
gard to the reality of the proposed inclusion

.of young ladies in our fair college.

First, it appears that somehow the corpor-
ate spirit here has been overwhelmed by a
selfishness unparalleled in modern history
— not a breath has yet been spent on what
Davidson could do for the young women
brought here.

The entire focus of debate to date has
been based on an assumption of female
peonage — bringing women, like building
new dorms or adding some more drink
machines, for the comfort of and at the dis-
posal of the courageous gentlemen of Da-
vidson.

What would life be like here for a girl?
Would the girls who came turn into the
imagined Cinderellas at freshman camp?

We see that the coeducation situation at
Wake Forest approaches open antagonism
at times. At Furman upperclass girls say
they might as well be in an all-girl school
when Saturday night comes — televisions
are about the same everywhere.

Recent addition of women students at
Presbyterian College in South Carolina does
not appear at this stage to have worked out
very well.

At Cornell University women students
claim that even though they’re heavily out-
numbered they usually spend big weekends

studying in their rooms. Others leave campus
on such weekends.

If there is any concern here for this kind
of problem it has been well guarded from
public view.

Even the sage voice of THE DAVIDSON-
IAN has spoken only in self-serving tones.
And even more myopicall , that paragon of
editorial perceptivity has failed to even con-
sider Davidson should think it can
make a contribution in the realm of women’s
education,

Exactly why should Davidson take it upon
itself to step into women’s higher education?
Does this nation, does this region, need
another $3,000 per year, middle-class, pri-
vate women’s collegé?

If the college has a social responsibility
in education to do certain things it also has
responsibility not to do certain things. This
may be one of those things.

Several weeks ago Davidson’s president
announced a fund drive to raise funds he
said were needed “not only for current ob-
jectives such as faculty salaries and library
purchases, but also to meet expected de-
mands of the new curriculum .. .”

He said all these things are “expensive
but necessary if Davidson is to meet its
commitments to new generations.”

Davidson has strived for excellence in the
past. The considerable success in this pur-

suit is one legacy worth keeping.

__ When the present student body is housed
in inadequate dormitories, when the college
is trying to build a new library, when every-
one agrees that the faculty must be in-
creased and strengthened with superior
scholars-—- is this the time to divert ited
financial resourses, limited faculty time and
psychic energy, and limited knowledge to a
gargantuan project which could easily be-
come the consuming effort of the entire
college community for the better part of a
decade, if it were done correctly?

_ At a formerly all-male college in the East,
similar to Davidson in enrollment and en-
dowment, professors in the men’s division
are muttering about how much better their
own academic program would be without
the outlays to the newly-opened women’s
division, expenditures that have spread re-
sourses thin for materials and salaries.

It is possible for us to create a fair-head-
ed, skirted stepchild of our own that turns
into a monster at conception? Like it or not,
a such a fate irreversibly locked in the |

enes?

Ah, Hysteria, Thou flower of the arts.
Thou art as pervasive as the Mid-Winters
snow. But I fear that like the snow when
Thy smooth surface has melted away before
the full light of day only the muddy prob-
lems so exquisitely hidden will remain.
