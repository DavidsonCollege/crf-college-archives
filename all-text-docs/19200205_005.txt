We hope

You won't grope

For the point of our wit
Its not too deep

To cause you sleep

So try to see it.

If we should fall into the Drink

We should be inclined to sink

Because the sinkers we devour

Would pull us down in the sad hour,

But then the grits, that we have

Would give us grit that can’t be

LECTRICITY has leveled out
the Continental Divide. The
steam locomotive, marvelous as it is
after a century of development, can-
not meet allof the presentdemandsfor
transportation facilities. Its electric
rival has proved to be far superior.

On the mountain divisions of the
Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul
Railway—the world’s greatest elec-
trification—giant electric locomotives
today lift an ever increasing freight
* tonnage over the mile-high Rockies
and also make traveling clean and
comfortable. They utilize the abun-
dant energy of distant waterfelis and
then, by returning some of this
power to the trolley, safely brake the
trains on descending grades. And
their capabilities are not impaired
by excessively cold weather when the
steam engine is frozen and helpless.

Electricity is the power which
drives the trains of New York City’s
subway and elevated systems, It
operates the locks and tows the ships
through the Panama Canal. It pro-
pels the Navy's latest super-dread-
naught, the New Mexico, Electric
mine locomotives have replaced the
slow-moving mule and the electric
automobile has alsocome todoanim-
portantservice. Such achievements
were made possible by the extensive
research and manufacturing activities
of the General Electric Company.

Electricity has become the universal
motive power. It has contributed
efficiency and comfort to every form
of transportation service and in this
evolution General Electric apparatus
hes played a large part — from
mighty electric locomotives to
the tiny lamp for the automobile.
