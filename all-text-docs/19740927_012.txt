reproduce about one half of
the tonal range that FM can.”’

Continued Smith, who has
had three years’. of
professional
engineering experience, ‘‘The
flourescent lighting inside and
outside of the dorms interferes
with AM reception. Anybody
who has tried to listen to an
AM radio in the dorm is
probably aware of how very
much AM signal interference
there is.”’

Smith added, “To make
sure everybody: could receive
the AM carrier-current signal
would require buying. and in-
stalling better equipment than
the College now has. Even
then the reception would not
be good. In general I would
Say Carrier-current is not a
viable or practical alternative
to the FM we now have.”

Lawrimore acknowledged
that construction costs of the
new station would run bet-.
ween $100,000 and $200,000, ac-
cording to estimates he has
received from other ‘radio
stations and professional elec-
tronics engineers. |

“‘Hopefully the increase in
power would be financed
through grants from the Cor-
poration for Public Broad-
casting, a fund drive in the
Charlotte area, contributions
from other individuals in the
area interested in our station,
and through grants from foun-
dations,”’ stated Spencer.

One of the four fulltime em-
ployees of WRFK at Union
Seminary, Dick Margan, said
that this year the WRFK
budget allotment is $70,000.
which is initially underwritten
by the seminary. The station
then repays the seminary as
much of that allotment as it
can through the contributions
and grants it receives.

Morgan, who is in charge of
fund raising for WRFK, says

that getting businesses to un-
derwrite programs has been
especially difficult in recent
months. As a consequence, for
less than the hoped-for $15,000
may actually be solicited. He
also admits that the salaries of
the fulltime staffers <‘are
nothing fantastic” with the
budget of $70,000 covering all
production. and operation
costs as well as the salaries
at the station.

At this time there are four
fulltime, two parttime, and no
students working at WRFK.
Morgan ‘explained that six
people can run the station
because it is automated.
“But,” adds Morgan, “‘before
the station was automated it
was operated by an even
smaller staff.”

In the opinion of S.G.A.
President Blain Butner,
“Going from the current ten
watt operation to a 50,000 watt
professionally directed station
would be comparable to con-
verting THE DAVIDSONIAN
into the Davidson Update.
The former is a student-run
news publication while
the latter is a part of the
College’s . professionally run
public relations program.”

Wilensky posed two
questions concerning the
issue. “‘Would a return to AM
carrier-current, broadcasting,
with its inherently lower
quality reception, suit student
needs for a medium through
which to express their
creative tastes? Also, just
how much student imput could
there be and would there be at
a 50;000 watt Davidson College
station?

As it now stands, program-

ming at the 50,000 watt facility
would be primarily classical
music and_ educational
programming, such as foreign
language broadcasts, campus
lectures, and tapes prepared
by the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting. Also, area news
and Davidson College athletic
events would be covered.
__ “No student input has gone
into the decision making
process as of yet. Perhaps we
need to explain that we want
our viewpoint heard,” Wilen-
sky concluded.
