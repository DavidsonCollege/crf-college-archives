THE DAVIDSONIAN

SPORTS

Tracking their success;
watch these freshmen

By WALKER SAIK _
Senior Staff Writer

No one typically pays much attention to
runners. They tend to keep to themselves,
haul it around the track a few times each
practice, hit the locker rooms, then the
books. Notice the lack of special attention.

But more and more, those runners are
starting to deserve our attention.

Take, for example, Megal Atias ’08, who
came all the way from small-town Israel to
compete here at Davidson.

She just recently logged a 4:41.62 1500
time that happens to be best in the SoCon
this spring and just over a second off the
school record. |

“T love it. It’s a
whole different
world,” said Atias
of running in the
States. “Back at
home, the compe- | ™—
tition wasn’t as
serious, and I
never had as big
of a team. I love
the girls on my
team, and I really
appreciate the
opportunity to run
here.” ;

breaking the 400 (50.46), 200 (22.71), and
4X400 relay (3:22.52) marks at ‘the SoCon
Indoor Championships. Paul Wyatt ’05,
David Ritchie 07, and John Bialas ’07 were
the other three legs of the relay. ,

Ask Flessa what he’d like to see in his sea-
son, and you’ll find out his eyes are on the
Conference meet.

“J just want to place in Conference—like
score a point,” he said. “And all-conference
in the 4X400 would be really nice too. We’d
like to -break the [4X400] outdoor record,
and we’ve already got the indoor one.”

Getting back to Atias—in case you were
curious—she’s from a_ small town
(Maccabim- Reut, which is much tougher to

3 % pronounce than it
looks) that’s
between Tel Aviv
and Jerusalem. Her
dad ran for the
Israeli team, so she
used to get to run
> around her village
as a kid. By high
school, though, she
had to travel to
find a club team.

“(In Israel], ath-
letics ‘and school
are separated,” she
explained. “I had
to commute to Tel
Aviv to train with
my team, and we
ran only _ three
times a week

since she quit Atias 08 | is the best 1500 runner in SoCon. together, so right

softball in eighth grade.

Her 400 outdoor PR of 59.2 is less than a
second off of the school record, and when
you ask her of any personal ambitions, she’ ll
give you a stern reply: “The outdoor 400
meter record.”

“In high school, it was a rare day if we ran
over 200 meters in practice,” said Walter of
the switch to college running. “Initially, it
was tough, but your body adjusts. From day
one, we were running full spring workouts.”

On the men’s side there’s Stefan Flessa
08, who had a breakout sophomore year in
high school and hasn’t really slowed down
since.

In fact, he had a part in three school
records in one meet not too long ago by

now, these organized team runs are great.

She adds that if she does as well as she
hopes this year, she may travel to Italy this
summer to represent Israel in a European
youth championship.

Pretty cool, huh?

Not to mention she’s traveled to places
like Scotland and Russia to compete.
Somehow New Jersey just doesn’t seem as
special anymore.

Atias and the rest will soon get their one
chance to shine at home too, as Davidson has
its lone home meet of the year coming up on
April 23.

So try to make it out, because the new kids
are pretty good, and they do deserve a little
of that special attention.
