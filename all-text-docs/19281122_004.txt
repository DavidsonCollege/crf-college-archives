To College Campus For
Home-Coming Day Event

Over Five Hundred Former Stu-

Exercises

FULL DAY’S PROGRAM

Alumni Luncheon Served to
Three Hundred Men in Gym-
.  Masium at 1 o’Clock

There is no accurate or definite way in
which to determine the exact number of
Davidson College alumni who returned to
the campus last Saturday for the annual
Homecoming celebration, but it is esti-
mated that fully 500 former students of
the college turned their footsteps toward
their Alma Mated for this oceasion. A
noteworthy fact was the larger number
who registered during the early morning
hours. .

Begining in the morning at 11:15
o'clock with a R. O. T. C. parade on
Sprunt Field, the alumni had a full day's
program that did not end until the final
curtain on the stunt night performance in
Shearer Hall at 9:30 o'clock that night.

During the entire day the college was
host to the men who.had attended thetn=
stitution, and expressions of gratification
late Saturday afternoon and that night
have led to the belief by alumni officials
that it was an eventful day for the alumni.
The handling of the crowd had been sys-
tematized, and no unusual confusion re-

"sulted. ;

Immediately following the military pa-
rade were exercises at the stadium, which
were presided over by Rev. John Mc-
Sween, '08, president of the Presbyterian
College of South Carolina. Dr. W. J.
Martin, '88, president of Davidson, wel-
comed the visitors; Dr. C. K. Brown, ’21,
associate professor of economics, read a
list of 25 names of alumni who had died
during the past year, and Col. A. L. Gas-
ton, 96, of Chester, S. C., made the princi-
pal address. This was interspersed with

the singing of “College Ties’ and “O,
Davidson.”
Over 300 alumni. adjourned to the

Alumni Gymnasium at 1:00 o'clock, where
they were served lunch. A feature of this
affair was the playing of the Lenoir High
School Band, winner of last year’s high
school contest among such organizations,
who not only added color to this event,
but assisted the local band in entertaining
the crowd at the football game with musi
cal numbers.

The principal event of the day was the
football game in the afternoon between
the University of North Carolina and Da-
vidson. While alumni saw their Witdcats
accept a 30 to 7 defeat, they wer: by no
means unsatisfied with the performance 91
the eleven, which lived up to the tfadi-
tional reputation of fighting qualities .un-
der adverse conditions, and as long as
their strength remained, played dne of the
most brilliant and thrilling games seen at
Davidson. Alumni saw that it was man-
power which defeated Davidson, and even
then the visitors resorted to an overhead
attack to smother the Wildcats.

Many alumni remained over Saturdiy
night and Sunday, and on the former oc-
casion had opportunity of witnessing the
stunt night performance, when the Glee
Club and its various parts gave selections,
and when the four classes presented stunts.

Alumni at Davidson last Saturday rep-
resented 47 different classes and came
here from the states of North and South
Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Virginia, Ten-
nessee, West Virginia, Oklahoma, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, some of them traveling ap-
proximately a thousand miles to be here
for the celebration.

James William Wilson, 1888, of Mor-
ganton, died at the home of his sister,
Mrs. R. L. Gibbon, in Charlotte, Friday,
November 16, after being in declining
health for the past few fiionths. Funeral
services were Hfeld at his home in Morgan-
ton, Saturday afternoon, where many
friends from various sections of the state
gathered for the last rites.

Mr. Wilson was not a graduate of Da-
vidson, coming here in 1884 and leaving
after a two-year stay. He attended the
University of North Carolina during the
session 1886-1887, and went to Knoxville,
where he was connected with engineering
concerns. For the past several years he

friends were returning from the Raleigh
fair when the car in which they were rid-
ing turned over three times at a sharp
curve. Another member of the party was
seriously injured. Mr. Peters and the
other injured person were riding in the
rumble which was probably the
reason of their mishaps.

JACKSON SPEAKS

(Continued from page 1)
from the backbone, the separation of in-

tellect and life’s gpntrolling factor has
tended to make our religion like that of
Pilate’s, a matter of reason lacking a firm,
dominating life principle.

Often we are inclined to wonder why
God has put into our being certain in-
stincts and impulses which seem to make
it much harder to do that which is right.
Yet the proper control of such instincts
as those of mating, acquisition, and combat
will result in their vast amount of energy
finding expression through constructive
channels,

Indecision over a long period of time
really results in decision, a decision to do
nothing. We are then content to drift in
the flotsam of do-nothingness rather than
to strive against obstacles in answering
the call of Jesus Christ.

Jesus is infinitely patient with our hu-
man failures and is ever willing to help us
on to victory over ourselves and tempta-
tion. Therefore, let us rise in His
strength, crush that “Don't bother me”
spirit that is standing in the way of real
life, and answer His challenge to sacri-
ficial serviee.

Last Saturday—Home-Coming Day
—wires were received from Dr. J. H.
McDuffie, ’10, of Columbus, Ga.; Rev.
J. Blanton Belk, D.D., ’15, of Orland,
Fla., and James McCutchen, ’23, of
Spartanburg, S. C., in which they ex-
pressed regret that they could not at-
tend the celebration, and sent regards
to their classmates. This is the first
time such messages have been received
on Home-Coming Day.

“Wonder how many people the
radio program brought back today?”
said one of the alumni musingly. “I
know that it brought me and a party
of five, for I did not intend to come
until I heard the program.”

This brings to mind the response
which alumni gave Tuesday night, No-
vember 13, during the radio program.
Telegrams were received from .David-
son men in Atlanta, Ga.; Winterhaven,
Fla.; St. Petersburg, Fla.; Rochester,
N. Y.; Gastonia, Concord, Lilesville,
Kings Mountain and Rock Hill, S. C.
One alumnus called by telephone from
Quincy, Fla‘, and another friend of the
college wired from Blacksburg, S. C.

Robert Critz, '17, of Winston-Salem,
returned to the Home-Coming celebra-
tion in an airplane, and was accom-
panied by three friends. This is the
first time that a Davidson alumnus has
used this mode of travel to reach Da-
vidson. He landed on the field near
Huntersville.

It was believed here last commence-
ment that a record had been placed on
the registration books when one alum-
nus returned for the first time since
1876. However, that has been shat-
tered, for when Gen. W. A. Smith, '66,
North Carolina Commander of the
Confederate Veterans visited David-
son last Saturday, it was the first time
since the Civil War, he said. Dr. J.
M. Dunlap, ’73, of Ansonville, was with
General Smith. Dr. Dunlap was at
Davidson two years ago, however.

It was no uncommon sight to see Da-
vidson alumni here last Saturday who
had returned from distances of: 300
miles, but those who came from the
points farthest away were J. M. Bos-
tick, '23, of Toledo, Ohio; John A. Cal-
houn, ’27, of Philadelphia, Pa.; Chas.
C. Baskerville, ’28, of Tampa, Fla., and
Dr. J. C. Peden, ’10, of Tulsa, Okla.
There might have been others who did
not come by the alumni office.

A glance at the registration books in
the alumni office. reveals the fact that
alumni were here Saturday for visits
for the first time since 1898, 1901, 1905,
1913, 1917, 1919, 1921, 1922 and 1923.
Six had not -been at Davidson’ since
1914, 1916 arrd 1920. This includes only
the registration list, and not all gave
the information desired as to the time
of their last visit. For the past two
years and a half thirty-three alumni
visited the campus again after a lapse
of time that ranged from 10 to 64
years, and many others for shorter
periods,

If anyone wants to know what it
means to alumni when they come back
to Davidson, just stay around the
alumni office for an hour on Home-
Coming Day or at Commencement.
You would be surprised at the fre-
quent statements, “Nobody knows how
good it is to be back once again,” or “I
thought Davidson was a great old
place when I was a student here, but
I appreciate it ten time more now that
T have left.” Ad infinitum,

Groups of alumni in the office here
have been frequently heard to discuss
whether Davidson should remain at its
present enrollment, or should be in-
creased. A consensus of opion of
every Davidson alumnus would be in-
teresting, if a canvass were ever made
by the alumni office. From what has
been heard, beliefs are about equally
divided.
