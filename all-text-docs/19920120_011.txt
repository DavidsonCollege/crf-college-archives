Is West Point the Site
of New World Order?

Caroline Williamson

What will the new world order
look like? What role should the
United States play in this interna-
tional system?

Last November 20-23, I at-
tended the Forty-Third Annual
Student Conference on United
States Affairs at the. United States
Military Academy in West Point,
New York. For three days, 142
college juniors and seniors, 40
cadets, and 30 international stu-
dents debated the question “After

the Cold War: One World or

Many?”

In order to focus this topic ona
certain area of the world, each
delegate was assigned to one of 15
small discussion groups. A mem-
ber of the East European
Roundtable, I was amazed by the
quality of discussions among the
18 participants. Our immense
diversity in backgrounds and opin-

ions -- the students represented
Hungary, Bulgaria, Germany, Cali-
fornia, Rhode Island, Florida,
Texas, Ohio, Virginia -- made it
difficulttoreachaconsensus. Since
the product of our talks was.a pol-
icy recommendation to the rest of
the conferees, however, a general
agreement on U.S. interests and
goals in the region was crucial.
Several speakers and social
events supplemented our hefty
academic pursuits. The keynote
panel, comprised of two profes-
sors, an economic advisor to the
President, a former congressman,
and a retired television talk show
host, further addressed this issue
of a new world order. Richard
Armitage, our banquet speakerand
the negotiator of the Philippine’s.

May To Lead

Campaign for Davidson

By Susan Sheffield

Jamie May, Directorof Devel-

opment, was recently chosen to
take over the direction of the
Campaign for Davidson, a six-year
fundraising effort designed to give
aschool of Davidson’s high qual-
ity the financial resources that it
should have.

“Davidson is a terrific college
whose only perceptible weakness

is endowment.” Furthermore, ‘he’ -

suggests that Davidson would al-
ways be ranked in the top five
among the nation’s colleges if it
had the financial base that other
schools of a comparable size do.
For = example, Amherst,
Swarthmore and Williams each
have endowmentsexceeding $260

, million. Davidson’s hovers around
$90 million.

From the $150 million that the
Campaign plans to raise by 1995,
approximately $90 million will be
given to the Davidson Endowment.
May says that 60 percent of this
goal has been met, which is won-
derful, but now a difficult part of

the fundraising process appears.
Because the people closest to
Davidson have already donated,

_ the Campaign must now voyage

into the wider community. Publi-
cations, presidential weekends with
prospective donors and faculty
efforts are all means to achieve this
expansion.

According to May, the shift in
his duties corresponds well to the
current position of the Campaign.
Rather than continuing to build a
staff as he has done as Director of

Development, he will now focus Faw

on the mechanism of the Cam-
paign.

His love for this school comes
naturally, having graduated in
1970. He returned after several

-years in Atlanta, where he taught

U.S. History and Government.
“One of my great pleasures is
working with people that I knew as

: professors.” He and his wife, Pro-

fessor Cynthia Lewis, look+for-
ward to raising their 21 month-old
son in Davidson, a town he calls
enlivening and exciting.
