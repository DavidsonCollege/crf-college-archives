SGA candidate promises better weather for the remainder of semester

Rob York ’08 ealebiieed his victory as
Junior Class President by immediately get-

tion and convenient lapses in memory.
“Students should be aware of the options

on such promises.

elections this year were char-
acterized by a call from voters
to fulfill campaign promises;
York is visibly responding to
the strong student demand for
immediate action.

York’s platform rested on
two major issues. First, York
said, he will “work to ensure
sunnier weather and warmer
temperatures as the spring
semester goes on.” Secondly,
he hopes to promote the inter-
ests and well-being of students
with low motivation and poor
work habits.

The weather issue received a
deal of attention from voters
and is thought to have made
the difference in the election.

“These cold and rainy days
are a downer for everyone,”
York said. “SGA is supposed to
act as the voice and the arm of
the student body, and the lack

“of effort to get spring weather
here by springtime represents a failure on
the part of SGA.”

York’s other promise, to provide a voice to
alternative work styles, has also been kick-
started by his administration. His proposals
included holding seminars on procrastina-

things to do instead of homework, to say
nothing of what Patterson Court and the
senior apartments offer.”

While support won York the election, his
critics have been outspoken in their ques-
tioning of his ability to really carry through

Townies: fi talk with the owner of
the Lake Norman Monster museum

The Yow: In this edition of Townies, The
Yowl interviews Roger Barney, the owner of
“eNORMous,” the new museum dedicated
to Norm, the fabled Lake Norman Monster.
Roger, thanks for meeting with us.

Roger Barney: Of course. It’s my pleas-
ure to introduce your readers to Norm, Lake
Norman’s most famous prehistoric inhabi-
tant.

TY: What can
you tell us about
Norm?

RB: Well, to
be honest, we
don’t know too
much about
him. And, as a
disclaimer to
your _ readers,
most of what we
know has either
probably been
made up or is
most definitely
a lie. :

TY: Lies? How could you have created a
museum then, if you admit the whole con-
cept is a fictional story?

RB: Oh, that’s simple. My museum,
eNORMous, documents and puts on exhibit
the various tall tales, fables, yarns, folk sto-
ries and drunken or demented screaming gib-
berish told about the Lake Norman Monster.

TY: Ah, I get it. The museum is really just
a bit of fun that you’re having with a famous
story.

RB: That’s where you’re wrong, mister.
The backcountry yokels regard their bab-
blings with the utmost seriousness. You
would find yourself in the midst of a heated
exchange, and probably on the wrong end of
a shotgun, should you ever try to call them
out on their obviously false, imagined or hal-
lucinated sightings.

TY: What causes these hallucinations,
these sightings?

RB: Moonshine, mostly. Also, hillbillies
have an inherent craving for attention. But
mostly moonshine.

TY: Can you describe what people think
the monster looks like?

Barney shows off a fish that would be a satisfying
appetizer for Norm, the Lake Norman Monster.

RB: Norm’s been spotted by hundreds of
country folk since the lake was created in the
1960s, and he’s rumored to be over 100
yards long, covered in green scales and the
owner of hundreds to thousands of rows of
sharp teeth. Overall, Norm seems to be a fine
specimen with typical monstrous attributes.

TY: How did Norm come to inhabit a rel-
atively unknown,
manmade body of
water like Lake
Norman?

RB: One local
Norm historian,
Sam the Spitting
Drunk, says that
during the Carter

Administration,
General Robert E.
Lee’s spirit took
the form of a lake
monster in order
to bring fame to

the South, and
ultimately, to
overthrow Carter and start a new underwater

Confederacy.

Another scholar, One-Eyed Moonshine
Willie, believes that Norm is a secret govern-
ment experiment created to battle colossal
catfish with supernatural psychic powers
planted by the Communists to discover the
recipe to his grits. The C.I.A. found the cat-
fish after they built Lake Norman and alert-
ed Willie to their whereabouts before they
swore to protect him.

TY: Sounds fascinating. What else can we
expect to find in your museum?

RB: We’ll have various drawings of Norm
and pictures of locals holding out their arms
as far as they can in order to describe how
big they think Norm is. Also, I hope to
always have at least one drunken hillbilly
available to entertain museum-goers with a
story of a recent sighting, most likely one
that he will be making up as he goes.

TY: Thank you for your time, Mr. Barney,
and good luck with your museum.

RB: It’s my pleasure. Now, make sure you
watch for Moonshine Willie on your way
out. He’s been known to shoot on sight.

“It’s time that SGA represented all the stu-

SGA has been an industrious, hardworking
student with academic prowess. What about

who have never been able to get someone
