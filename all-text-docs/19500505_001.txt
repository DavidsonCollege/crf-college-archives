Rutledge Presents
Literary Laurels;
Speaks to Students

-The presentation by Mr, Archi.
bald Rutledge, famous poet laureate
of South Carolina, of the annual
Vereen ‘Bell award for  creativ:
writing was the occasion of chapel |
last Monday morning. This year
the award was presented to ver-
sitle Bill! Trotman for the writing
of an “extraordinary work," a sym-
phonic drama, complete with or-
chestration and stage scttings, a-
bout Blackbeard, infamous pirate,
who prowled North Carolina’s
coasts. Mr. Rutledge said that in
his estimation the work deserves
to be ranked with Paul Green's
renowned, “The Lost Colony.”

Honorable mention went to two
other entries, Mack Bulgin, for his
“Idiot Look of  J.ove,” drew
from Mr. Rutledge the observation
that the accuracy of phychology in
modern young people terrified him.
Bill Beattie, a senior from Atlanta,
Ga., also won honorable mention
with his “High Dive.” ;

In a short introduction talk, Mr.
Rutledge immediately won his audi-
ence by remarking with his char
acteristic quick wit, “after that
wonderful introduction, I can hardly
wait to hear what I'm going to
say.” At the present time he is
devoting a great deal of time to
helping young unknown writers get
the breaks they deserve. He feels
qualified to judge talent, and uses
his influence to “tell the world”
about promising writers.

The first purpose of a writer is
to make his meaning clear. If he
fails in this, his work is a failure
A writer who is obscure “has
nothing to say and says it pro-
foundly.” Genius and clarity walk
hand jn hand for one of the most
difficult things in literature is to
write something simple and clear
and concentrated.

One more valuable point was
stressed by Mr. Rutledge, the writ-
er owes a deep moral responsibility
to his reader. By this he does not

Vereen Bell Award
Given to Trotman

Monday morning in chapel, Rill
Trotman, freshman from Winston-
Salem, was awarded the Vereen
Bell Memorial award for creative
writing by Dr, Archibatd Rutledge,
poct laureate of South Carolina.

Each year the award, established
in honor of Vereen Vell, Davidson
graduate killed in the battle ot
the Coral Sea, is presented to the
student submitting the best writ-
ing. Bill's entry was “Blackbeard,”
a symphonic drama in two acts,
for which ‘he wrote the script,
composed the music, and designed
the sets.

The plot of “Blackbeard” is cen-
tered around the infamous pirate
of the eighteenth century whose
real name was Edward Leach, It
tells of his. ill-fated. romance with
his pirate-companion, Ann Bonney,
of his finding Katherine, who tried
to make his love for her lead him
to a good life; and of his death
through the conniving of the jeal
ous Ann. The principal setting is
a bluff on the island of Ocracoke,
Narth Carolina, which overlook¢
Albemarle Sound.

Rill conceived the idea of writ-
ing “Dlackbeard” several years ago
while he was a councilor at Camp
Morehead. He secured a vast ‘a-
mount of. pirate history at that time
from Mr, F. C. Salisbury of the
Twin City Times in Morehead
City. After compiling his material,
it took him a little over a year
to do the actual writing. Com-
menting on- the play, Dr. Rutledge
said: “It deserves to rank with
Paul Green's ‘Lost Colony’.”

Bill has been very active in dra-
matics at Davidson this year, hav-

Neil Leach Chooses
Next YMCA Cabinet;
Make Future Plans

Neil Leach, recently elected presi-
dent of the student YMCA, an-
nounced to the Davidsonian Wed-
nesday afternoon, his cabinet se-
lections for the 1950-51 school year.

With the exception of the posi-
tion of Freshman Advisor which

is now being voted on by the ris-|}

ing senior class, next year's YMCA

cabinet is complete The newly ap-

pointed cabinet members will work
under the leadership of student-
elected YMCA administrators: the
president; Ist Vice-President, Al-
fen Strand; 2nd Vice-President,
Bryan Robinson.

Reorganization is the keynote
of l.each’s first action in his new
Two principle
steps are the basis of next year’s
revitalized program. Last year, the
YMCA cabinet was divided into
four commissions—Faith and Wor-
ship, Social Activity, Service, and
World Christianity — which was
headed by a chairman and acted as
coordinating councils within the
cabinet.

Leach feels that momentum is
lost under such a system and that
service may be carried on more
efficiently by returning to the ori-
ginal plan of YMCA presidents,
that to bring the entire cabinet
back under the direct, unifying or-
ganization of the straight cabinet
system. “Rather than waste good
manpower and give indefinite jobs
to cabinet members, each is to be
given specific jobs for which he
is responsible.” the new “Y” pres-
ident stated.

Secondly, he acclaims regularity
of cabinet meetings is to be estab.
lished: meetings will be held twice
a month,

Next year’s YMCA cabinet:

Vespers — Sandy Morton.

Chapel — Bob Gay. Last year’s
position on the cabinet — College
bible class chairman.

Spiritual development — Tommy
Langford. Last year’s position on
the cabinet — chairman of faith
and worship. .

aging editor of this year’s paper,

tell reporters of any new plans or
of any changes in policy he might
be considering for the Davidsonian

too early for me to have formed any
definite plans, I will say that we
will try to keep next year's paper
up at the high standard Bob Hol-
lister has set for it by utilizing the
experienced men who served with
Hollister on this year's staff. May-
be we can even improve the David-
sonian.”

his program with a ballade, inter-
