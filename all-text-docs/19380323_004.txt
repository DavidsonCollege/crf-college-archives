Perhaps the person most responsible for the maintenance of the
“Wildcat Spirit” last fall during the football season was Elmore
Holt, shown above, leading students in giving the famous old “Fight

Yell,” for which the college is renowned.

Davidson’s new infirmary houses a good deal
of brand new hospital equipment, which ‘has
become dear to Dr. John Wilson MacConnell,
College Physician. He is pictured above in his
own operating room in the new building, try-
ing out some of the new equipment on Avery
Patton, of the college chemistry department.
Besides this new equipment in the operating
room, Dr. MacConnell ‘has therapy equipment
in the basement.

Pictured above is a practice scene from Davidson's Centennial
Pageant so widely heralded last spring and which was to have been
presented during graduation. But Jupiter Pluvius interferred, and
there was no pageant. Last semblance of the pageant passed a few
weeks ago, when the stage, shown above, on Richardson Field, was
torn down.

The cartoon above, drawn by Sam Ryburn, exhibits what has
come to be one of the burning issues of the Student Body in the
past month—that of allowing freshmen to vote. Main instigator of
the idea was friend “Boru.”

The famed torrid trumpet of Bunny Berigan blared forth at the
Charlotte Armory-Auditorium on the week-end of Feb. 11-12, when
“Bunny” and his hot swing band were presented by the Pan-Hellenic
Council for the annual Mid-Winter set of three dances. This trumpet
of Bunny’s was heard on many hot choruses.
