Journal Tells

Munich Story

April Issue to Carry Mac-
Bryde Article

Davidson’s alumni journal,
which will appear during the
last part of April, will report
an unusually large amount of
old graduates’ deaths.

This fact was discovered as ma-
terial for the alumni personals was
being compiled. Dr. K. J. Foreman,
who editing this issue of the
magazine, has tentatively selected
April 20 for the date of publica-
tion. A large part of the material
will be sent to the printers during
spring vacation.

Duncan MacBryde

A feature of the 24-page issue,
the second of this term, will be the
continued article by Duncan Mac-
Bryde, a graduate of Davidson who
is: studying in Europe. MacBryde
will tell in this installment of the
four-power parley in Munich,
which he personally observed last
fall.

A resume of sports, written by

Davidsgnian Sports Editor Toni
Casoli, will also be-earried. In

addition to these articles there will
be several by members of the fac-
ulty and Dr. Lingle. The cover will
probably include a picture of the
sons of alumni who are members
of the present senior class.

Citizenship
Duty of Christian to State Is

Subject of Sunday School
Lesson

FREEDOM IS DISCUSSED

Dr. P. H. Gwynn chose
“Christian Citizenship” as the
text of the Sunday School les-
|son, which he taught in Phi
Hall last Sunday. His talk was

based on Matthew 22:21,
which reads, “Render unto
Caesar the things that are
Caesar’s; and unto God the

things that are God’s.”

In the course of the lesson, Dr.
Gwynn set consid-
ers to be three duties of a David-
graduate to the State. “The
duties,” he said, “is

forth what he

freedom the foundation

Gwynn, to that have

Church Has Two Programs
Dr. Gwynn said that there is in

| the Presbyterian Shurch a pro-
}gram for the social’ order of the
| state as well as for the individual
| soul in the church. To illustrate
| this, he gave the following ex-
| ample: suppose the State Legisla-
ture, now in session in Raleigh,

were to abolish all of the Sunday
laws of this state. In such a case,
would the Church
