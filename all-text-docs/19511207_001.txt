Battle Gives
Frosh Chance
To Vindicate

Plans for Freshman-Sophomore
Day, to be held Tuesday at 3:30
p.m., are nearing completion, John-
ny Guiton, head of the Court of
Control, announced today.

Competition will be in three
fields: football, tug-of-war, and a
six-man relay, and the freshmen are
expected to form a cheerleading
unit as well as a band.

Discard Caps

Should the freshmen emerge vic-
torious in two of the three events,
they probably will be allowed to
discard their caps and forget the
Freshman Regulations; but Judge
Guiton pointed out that “Freshman
spirit has to be excelent even to
win, but if it isn’t top notch, the
Freshman Regulations will stay as
they are, even if the frosh do win.’

The freshman band, led by Budd
Montgomery, will practice Monday

afternoon, and on Tuesday will

march from Chambers Building to
the stadium, followed by the cheer-
leaders and the freshman class,
amply supplied with banners and
signs.

der the capable tutoring of Bill

Archer, Bobby Amos, Corky. Clark,
Eddie Powe, Ronnie Wilson, Harry

tice Monday at 4:00 on-the varsity

3-Goal Gift Fund
giHopes For $6000

With a goal of $6,000 embracing a three-fold purpose, the
annual YMCA Christmas Gift Fund campaign kicked off this
morning in chapel. The Gift will be split among needs on a local,
state. and. foreign plane. $3,000 is earmarked for Caswell Train- |"

The Red Cross’ examining medical officer had to ask again when Lloyd Hale, right, from Gas-
tonia, answered the routine pre-blood donation question that this was the ninth time he had contributed.
The Davidson junior was wounded severely by machine gun fire in France in 1944 and received six
transfusions before recovery. Lioyd figures he’s just paying them back with interest. (Photo-Simons).

Lloyd Pays Debt Davidson Set
Made In France Blood Record

By MIKE MYERS
Last Monday Lloyd Hales was, for the fifteenth time, a fac-
tor in a blood transfusion. But this time a cute blonde nurse
replaced the battlefield medic, and this time the blood was flow-
ing out instead of in. The Gastonia junior doesn't talk much

about it now, but that winter day in
1944 still sticks only too vividly in
his mind,

“Gradually the mist in my eyes
began to lift. 1 blinked and tried
to shake my head but someone was
holding it down. Then slowly the
cobwebs in my mind began to clear.
Looking up from the table I saw
a white blot before me that actual-
ly was the face of the medic. He
was putting the finishing touches
on the dressing.

Plasma Saved Him

“You'll be O.K., Sergeant, You'll
be O.K. But you've got that to
thank.” He nodded his head to my
right. There life was flowing into
my arm. All at once I felt good

-linside. Brother, that blood plasma
looked mighty good! Now I knew|

I'd be O.K.”

During the next 129 days fol-
lowing the above incident Lloyd
had plenty of time to think. But
during those days in the hospital
it was perhaps painful to recall the
break through at the Bulge by the
3rd Army. Lloyd was company run-

ner, so he had ‘been at battalion
headquarters that afternoon when
his C.O. was given his orders to

take a hill bordering a small Ger-:

man town.

“Star-Eyed” C. O.

The next morning they struck—
but then the C.O, “got stars in his
eyes. Or maybe he was gn the line
too long and was slap-happy” but
he ordered the town to be taken.
An Army order.is an Army order,
so armed only with infantry hand
weapons the advance was started.
Through the snow, yard by yard,
the group advanced, and dwindled.
(Final count: 35 out of 150 sur-
vived.)

For six days T don't believe I got
over one-half hotr sleep at any one
time.” Much of it was hand to hand
combat. The sixth morning. they
had started to work at 6:00. At
6:45 Lloyd, then platoon sergeant,
rose from his prone position to
urge the men forward. But he rose

Frats OK

Spivak

For Mid-Winters

Last week all but three fraterni-

ties voted unanimously to sign two |.

name bands, Charlie Spivak and Ray
Anthony for Midwinters and Spring
Frolics, respectively.

Spivak has been signed for Mid-
winters on February 15 and 16, but
Anthony, who had previously said
that he would be available, had al-
ready signed an engagement for the
Spring Frolics dates.

In the voting the fraternities
agreed to pay seven dollars for each
dance in order to have the two big
bands. Dick Stockton, president of
Pan-Hel, says that if a band com-
parable to that of Spivak or An-
thony can be signed for about the
same cost, then the price of the
tickets will be the same. However,
if a big name band cannot be
signed, the price will be announced
later,

Treasurer Joe Miller this week
released the Pan Hel financial re-

For District

The Davidson community estab-
lished a new record for. the twenty-
seven counties served by the Blood
Donor unit, when 446 pints were
donated at the blood drive last
Monday. This exceeded the. old
record by 46 pints, but fell short of
a $00-pint goal.

So great was the response that
30 people had to be turned away
due to lack of time.

In the six hours allotted for the
operation, the Red Cross procured
blood at a rate of just slightly under
75 pints per hour.

Officials of the Red Cross, in
heaping praise on Davidson for
this, were quick to point out
that the 446- total represented
more blood than the City of
Charlotte usually contributes in
half a month.

Lt. Col. J. L. Ballard, Jr.,
chairman of the drive, gave spe-
cial attention to the fine work
done in sponsoring the drive
in the student body and to the
great support given by the so-
cial fraternities. Three fraterni-
ties, Phi Delta Theta, Phi Gam-
ma Delta and Pi Kappa Phi
subscribed their entire member-
ship, with most of the other
fraternities close behind.

‘In addition to the fine work of
the student organizations in mak-
ing the drive so successful, the
Davidson Civic Club, comprised of
many ladies of the town and headed

by Mrs. Frank W. Frederickson,
largely provided the supporting
staffs.

Nofice

The following request came this
week to The Davidsonian from
Chaplain Alan Gripe: “All persons
or organizations wishing to use the
YMCA lounges for meetings should
make a reservation’ well aliead of
time for the particular room they
want, All reservations should be
made with Miss Shinn of the Guest
House or with Mr. Gripe at the
YMCA.” |

Chalmers Davidson Given
Historical Society Award

Professor Chalmers G. Davidson
of Davidson College, author of the
Piedmont Partisan, was recipient
of a Charles A. Cannon Award at
the North Carolina Society for the
Preservation of Antiquities dinner
in Raleigh Thursday night.

Dr. Davidson was honored for his
research and publications in the
field of North Carolina history. The
awards are given annually at the
Society’s meetings in recognition
of outstanding achievement in lit-
erature and history and in promot-

ing the objectives of the Society in
North Carolina,

Donated by Mr. and Mrs. Charles
A. Cannon of Concord, a sterling
loving cup was presented to Dr.
Davidson by Dr. Archibald Hender-
son of the University of North
Carolina.

Dr. Davidson's most recent book,
Piedmont Partisan, is a biography
of the Revolutionary general for
whom Davidson College a1 Da-
vidson County were named

fessor Raymond ‘Tyson

marking the beginning of the
Y. M. C. A. sponsored forum on
"Christianity and Politics. Con-

gressman Richards’ speech will
start a series of chapel addresses
which will also include talks by
Senator Clyde R. Hoey and Gov-
ernor Kerr Scott.

THE TWO-PRONGED arrange-
‘inent of the forum will have the
chapel speakers and a ‘panel dis-
,eussion. The panel will be held in

the Y lounge Wednesday night at |

‘7 p.m, December 12, and will be
| Reveonen of Mayor Victor Shaw.
| Representative William Pope, Mr.
,J. Caldwell McDonald, with Pro-
serving as
| moderator. All students are invited
to attend.

It has been pointed out that
these six men represent virtually all
legislative levels of government:
Shaw represents city government,
McDonald stands for county gov-
ernment, Pope for state legislative
governinent, Scott for state execu-
tive government, Hoey for national
government, Richards for intetna-
tional.

THE MAIN PURPOSE of the
forum is to point out the Christian
approach to government through
venerating interest in government

at all levels by showing what the

private citizens can do to help im-
prove morals in government, and
hy presenting some insight into the
responsibilities of the citizen to his
government,

Strong emphasis has been laid ¢ on
attendance by a large number of
students at the panel discussion. To-
ward this end a great deal of ef-
fort has been expended in procuring
speakers who would provide a wide
variety of interest to the students.

WILLIAM POPE, the youngest
member of the panel, having grad-
‘uated from Davidson in 1940
should prove a case in point. He
was a Licutepant in the Navy in the
last war aud was awarded the Air
Meda! and the Distinguished Fly-
ing Cross. He has served in the
state legislature only one term, but
ia that time he introduced an im-
portant bill designed to keep boot-
leggers from buying back souped-
up ears taken in liquor hauls,

J, Caldwell. McDonald is dnother
Davidsonian (Class of °I5) active
in politics, For many years he has
served on the Mecklenburg County
Board of Commissioners and also
has been an active member of the
Charlotte VMCA, having served in
several important posts: there. Act-
ing as, general chairman of the Da-
vidson Development Program in
Mecklenburg county, he contributed

paign.

sored by the Quips and

will not even take a look-see
at the maps which guide the
Davidson man’s future.

the premature announcement
and took full blathe for the re-
lease himself.

Announcement as to the

shortage.

The. total amount raised will be
announced on the final day of the
drive, December 17, chairman Bry-
an Robinson announced.

Robinson stated that no one
will be forced to give any
money if they desire not to, but
that those who do give money
should do it by check or cash.
The money is payable at the
time of the visit of the can-
vassers to the halls, or if it be
the will of the contributor, he
may pledge to pay it by Jan-
uary 10, 1952.

The Caswell Training School, lo-
tated in Kinston, has 1,019 patients
at the present time, 600 of which
are able to exercise. This training
school is not a reformatory, but
rather a hospital for people who are
mentally and physically retarded
due to destroyed brain tissues, At
the present time this school has one
basketball floor which is the re-
mains of a chicken coop with the
top taken off. The floor is cracked.
and there is a drop of six to ten
inches on every side where the wa-
ter from a small but flooding creck
has eroded the soil. There is one
baseball field which. is too small,
and there is one piece of driveway
30 or 40 feet long used for skating.
This driveway is the only one of

the athletic facilities that can be
used at night.

The Christmas Fund Commit-
tee would like to help this
school build a 120 by 120 ce-
ment floor with sixteen flood-
lights for all weather athletics.
There would be no cost of up-
keep on the floor which would
contain two basketball courts or
three tennis courts, or six volley
ball courts. The amount of the
$6.000 goal to be used for this
purpose would be $3,000.

Here in Davidson there is a great
need for some mecting place for
the Negro teen-agers. The commit®
tee proposes to contribute $1,500
to help the Negro community get a
start in a fund drive to build a
brick veneer building on a lot next
to the. school to be purchased on
completion of the drive, The house
would have rooms including an of-
fice, a game room, and a parlor, The
lot would be wide cnough for base-
ball, horseshoes, tennis, and volley
ball:

Reports IFC Meet
To Pan-Hel Men

Bill Adams represented the Pan-
Hellenic Council of Davidson Col-
lege at the National Inter-Frater-
nity Conference held this past week
at Old Point Comfort, Virginia.

Mr, Adams will make his report
to the Pan Hellenic Council this
week and the Davidsonian will
carry a complete account of the re-
sults next week.

This conference, made up of rep-
resentatives from college inter-fra-
ternity organizations and repre-
sentatives of the national fraterni-
ties meets annually to exchange
ideas and develop co-operation
among the college Greek letter in-
stitutions. This body has no Iegisla-
tive power of its own, but finds it's
strength in the unity and uniformi-
ty that it gives to the national fra-
ternities.

Delegate Adams did comment
that the term Pan-Hellenic Coun-
cil is used to refer, for the most

part, to women’s Greek letter or-
ganizations and that Davidson was
one of only two institutions repre-
sented that used the name Pan-
Hellenic. The usual and now pre-
ferred term is simply Inter-Frater-
nity Council.
