THE DAVIDSONIAN, FEBRUARY 4, 1926

It is our opinion that the Freshman basket-
ball team will contribute a couple of good
men to the varsity next year. We might
miss our guess, but we believe that Craw-
ford is going to develop into as great a star
as his brother. His shots were short in
Monday’s game, but he has the right aim, and
shoots in the same style that characterized
“Pat's” playing back two years ago.

Mrs. W. H. Wooten, with her daugh-
ter, Mrs. Willis Johnston, of Moresville,
have been visiting relatives in Clarks-
ville.

C. A. service last Sunday evening. It was
one of the most impressive talks ever given
| here and a large per cent of the student body
| was present.

| Special music was rendered by Thompson,
| Wurzel, and Albright, after which Hebe Mc-
Ilwaine read from the tenth chapter of Luke
for the lesson of the evening. Dr.,T. W.
| Lingle then introduced the speaker and spoke
lof him in very high and worthy terms.
| Bishop Penick was already known to many
of the’ students as he spoke before the “Y”
last year.

| He began his talk by the urge that every-
|one should have a positive attitude toward
|life. He recounted an event in the life of
Leonardo da Vinci when he inspected some
{new work of art. When asked why he did
not criticize this rotten work, he said that
jhe spoke by deeds. It was what a man did
in this world and not what he did not do
that made his name.

“Christ came into the world and spoke to
people who knew the decalogue and lived
by the rules set down as things they should
‘not do but it never occurred that they must
/do things and He established this new em-
phasis and substituted aspiration for negation,
He told them that they were the salt of
the earth and were to give it swetness and
flavor but if they did not do this they were
salt without savor.”

To illustrate his point, Bishop Penick used
three parables. He used the parable of the!
talents which the man gave his servants.
“The servant to whom the landlord gave
one talent, returned it just as he had received
it and had not squandered it but had kept it
for his master. When he returned his talent
he was called wicked and slothful because he
had simply done nothing.

The second parable was that of the Good
Samaritan whom the thieves robbed ‘and |
left in the ditch beaten and suffering. “The
priest came along on his way from Jerico to
Jerusalem and saw the man in the ditch. The
people of Jerusalem were waiting for him
and so he decided to leave the Samaritan in
the ditch and go on, Likewise the Levite
came along and left him. The people would
wish to be as good as the priest or the Levite
but these had sinned. They did the man no
harm but they did nothing for him.”

The third was of the rich man and Lazarus.
Lazarus was at the gate of the rich man
who came out and saw him but did nothing
for him. “The rich man was not sinful and
lived well, keeping the commandments, but
when he saw his duty he shirked it even at |
his own gate and he was punished for the
sin.”

“We must have a positive attitude toward
life. Men are not known in this world for
their blamelessness but they are judged ac- |
cording to the good that they do. We must
have an open mind and free from prejudice, |
so that God may come in and help us. Ev- |
eryone is different and therefore we must |

understand each other better.”

“Another point of view is confidence in
our fellow man. We must trust him and not
look through the key-hole and suspect him.”
He gave the honor system, as it was first
put before him when he was yet very young,
as an example of confidence in each other,
and his sense of duty to live up to this trust
put upon him.

“We must trust in God. The nearness of
God is a modern idea. Some seamen were
lost and were perishing as their water had

Mr. Witless Hancock, of the Sophomore
class, is a most attractive man to the ladies,
as proved by a conversation with a fair
damsel at Converse last Saturday:

Young Lady—Won't you please stay to

extra, but we'll be glad to have you.

D. W.—Aw, that's all right, we're used to
poor food.

Our cub reporter, Sagacious Slimy Sloopy
Lingle, took his dazzling Karo Kisses jacket
to Richmond last week for the purpose of
blinding the eyes of a certain young lady
there. All went well until our noble writer
called up said young lady, but certain com- |
plications arose and young Lingle was un-
able to see the apple of his eye. He is now,
in the infirmary, recuperating from a broken |
heart and color blindness.

Two wild westerners, Holly Branch and
Bandit Farnsworth, donned their sombreros

He stressed the proper clothing of the limbs
and pedal extremities. It was a heart to|

that Branch is in the employ of a national

The picture “Classmates,” featuring Rich-
ard Barthelmess and depicting the cadet life
at West Point, is to be shown at the gym on |
the night of Saturday, the 6th. Barthelmess, |
as Duncan Irving, Jr., is the son of an hum-
ble resident of Pine Level, North Carolina.
He is very much in love with Sylvia Ran-
dolph, the ward of the wealthy Stafford fam-
ily, and it is because of the social distinction
between himself and this young lady that he
wishes to push himself forward and seeks |
entrance at West Point. After several futile
attempts, his hope is realized and Duncan
begins his cadet life. He finds several true
friends among his fellow “plebes” and likes
the new life from the start.

Later Bert Stafford, at the insistence of
his mother and sister, also enters West
Point. He has some stubborn characteristics |
and resents Duncan’s efforts to train and
help him.

promise to look out for Stafford and to be
patient with him. He does his best to get
along with Bert, but one day after the big
dance of the year Bert insults him before
several fellow students, and Duncan knocks
him down. Bert is not really seriously hurt,
but he pretends to be blinded, and causes
Duncan's dismissal and also the breaking of
his engagement.

Duncan becomes an engineer but is not able
to redeem himself in the eyes of Sylvia, who
has heard a false report of his conduct from |
Mrs. Stafford. Bert has also left the acad- ,
emy and become an engineer, and, after sev-

‘eral months Duncan hears that he has been

lost in the jungles of South America. He!
realizes that the only way for him to square |
himself is to find Bert and bring him back |
safely, and as a result he sets out on this |
quest immediately, with several of his |
friends. They plunge immediately into the |
jungles and, after weeks of struggle and
