Two Faculty Members
Confined By Sickness

Two members of the college
faculty and administrative staff

have been confined to _ their
homes recently by illness.
Prof. Archibald Currie has

been suffering from a mild at-
tack of bronchitis and has been

confined to his bed since last
Saturday, not attending his
classes. He is reported to be re-

covering rapidly and is expected
to return to his duties soon.

Grier Martin, alumni secretary,
was the victim of a furnace ex-
plosion on last Sunday morning,
when he poured kerosene on the
fire to build it up, and suffered
severe burns about his face. He
is recovering and is expected to
be at his post again within a few
days.

By SHERRARD RICE
If you .ever want to get senti-

mental about something, or if you
feel that a little cry might do you
good, just go-to the Phi Hall and
take a good look at the chandelier
there. First, think of it it is
today, somewhat resembling a lone-
ly, old mother, who is wistfully re-
calling the good old days when her
children were young and played at
her feet. Then, try to picture it
around twenty-five years ago, just
before another graduation, when,
with its candles lighted, it became
the center of attraction. It a
striking and touching contrast.

There is a lot of old tradition at-
tached to this chandelier. Accord-
ing to a book on Davidson College
written by Miss Cornelia Shaw,
the librarian, the chandelier was put
up on June 17, 1854. It was of
French glass and was imported
from France; along with it were
imported many tales as to its origin.
Again quoting from’ Miss Shaw's
book, we find this idea:

“The chandelier in the Philan-
thropic Hall is a duplicate of the
original under which Napoleon III

by Mr. William White of Sumter,
S. C., and presented to the Phil-

“It was the above article “which
probably gave rise to the belief on
the parts of many students and
members of the faculty that Na-
