_ Student Trustees

Why are there: no students on the
Board of Trustees? Though no one seems
to have to given the question much
consideration it certainly is a valid one.
In fact, careful consideration of the
matter reveals that it would be in the best
interests of the College if students were
put on the Board of Trustees.

The Board of Trustees at Davidson may
well be the most important group
associated with the school. They set the
policies for the College. They approve the
long-range goals for the College. They
are expected to handle any crisis at the
College (such as the recent Linden
affair). In effect, they are the main
decision-making body of Davidson. Why
then, are students not allowed any input
in this process?

The case for having at least three
elected students on the Board of Trus-
tees is strong indeed. First, students are
more familiar with the day to day
happenings at Davidson than anyone
else. They attend the classes, play in the
overcrowded gym, eat in the overcrowded
eating houses, and moan in despair when
the basketball team loses. The Board’s
actions affect every action of these
students. Why then shouldn’t the stu-
dents be given a “say so” in setting the
policies which will affect them so
greatly?

Hopefully, the Trustees want to know
how students feel about campus prob-
lems and policies. What better way for
them to find out how students feel than
to give them votes in the decision
process?

Secondly, with the present policy of no
Students on the Board, do the students
really have any influence at all? Of course
not. Students can attend SGA receptions
for the Trustees and speak to the
Trustees about problems they see, ‘but

how much effect does that haye?
Certainly the Trustees are receptive ‘to
student feelings, but in the long run that
is only one of their considerations. They
also have to consider the Alumni, the
Faculty, the Administration, etc. Thus,
there is truly no one who can speak for.
the students. There is no one who really
knows the ins and outs of student
sentiment. Nothing short of full voting
rights will serve to satisfy this need.

Having one student on the Board

would not be adequate. He would be
overwhelmed by committee assign-
ments. With at least three different
committees working on crucial prob-
lems, how would the student know which
to choose?

The optimum solution would be to

elect three rising seniors to serve on the
Board every year. The elections could be
held late in spring term with the winners
to serve the following year.

Seniors would be the best representa-

tives to the Board because their experi-
ence would allow them to put any
problems into some perspective. Three
would be a good number because that
would allow students sufficient repre-
‘sentation on committee without flooding
the Board. It is also imperative that the
students be allowed to vote. What good

is representation if they have no influ-

ence?

Student representation on College

Trustee Boards is becoming more and

more common. Vanderbilt and Wake
Forest both report having added students -
to their Trustees with very favorable
results. Student representation certainly
adds diversification to the Boards.

Student representation is a concept for
which the time is long overdue. Hopeful-
ly Davidson will soon make it a reality.

To the Editor:

The entire ruckus about
Davidson’s indirect invest-
ments in South Africa
deserves scrutiny. With fleeting
mention to the possibility of
stock voting rights, Dave Nash
proposes reinvesting away from
S.A. Will “giving up” invest-
ments tainted by profits from
S.A. do anything to halt
Apartheid? I doubt it. Consider
the results, even if similar
action were taken by a large
number of investors. Stocks are
sold, other people buy them,
perhaps at a lower price, and
returns on those stocks, if
anything, go up. It is possible,
of course, that stock prices
would drop enough to spur
controlling interests to change
corporate policy, but it seems
unlikely prices would drop that
far. Too many investors would
have to be unprofitably moral.
As long as companies invested
in S.A. make profits there, they
will probably remain. Apartheid
persists largely because it is
profitable.

_ I doubt that Davidson’s
‘moral integrity’’ compels it to
allow the most profitable inves-
tors for others who may be less
scrupulous. If Davidson and
other investors really wish to

Opinion

Christian ‘Apologetics’

By GEORGE MURDAUGH
Editorial Page Editor -

In past weeks the editorial
pages of The Davidsonian have
been splashed with opinions
concerning the ‘‘Christian char-
acter’’ clause contained in the
criteria for choosing Stuart
scholars. The Stuart family’s
prerogative to establish their
own selection criteria has not
been disputed. Rather, the Col-
lege’s use of such a scholarship
has.

If potential non-Christian ap-
plicants have not been discour-
aged by Davidson’s Statement
of Purpose in the past (and they
should not have been), then
why should they ignore the
school because the Stuart Scho-

larship program (one of many
scholarship programs) encour-
ages Christians to apply? One
might argue that the Statement
of Purpose has, in fact, dis-
couraged non-Christians from
applying in the past. But does
this mean that the Statement of
Purpose should be rewritten? I
should hope not.

Concerning the social setting:
some would like to see the
“Christians Only’’ criterion re-
jected. But what would happen
if Davidson rejected a scholar-
ship program for Blacks only?
We would be called racists, and
you can count on that.

Dr. Park’s point (The David-

sonian, Feb. 10, 1978) that’

restrictive scholarships do not
exclude anyone from attending

Davidson is well taken and
worth repeating. We do all
benefit from them as together
they attract a more diverse
student body. In my mind, it is
the non-Christian who is close-
minded if he decides against
considering Davidson solely be-
cause the Stuart Scholarship is
a Christian scholarship.

The Stuart family has every
right to include Christian char-

acter as a criterion for the

selection of scholarship reci-
pients. And for Davidson to
apologize for this criterion or
move to have it dropped would
be to apologize for.and severely
compromise the Christian ideals
on which the College was found-
ed.

Human opinion would be quite different if everyone would risk his

own: fear prevents some people from i

exhibit a high concern for
solving the Apartheidproblem,
even to the point of “sacrifi-
cing’”’ profits, they can attempt
economically effective action.
By increasing investment. in
some multinationals until they
exert force on corporate deci-
sions through voting rights, our
moral leaders could induce
withdrawal. Of course, that
would mean lower profits to
those corporations. And it
would mean real losses to these
well-meaning investors. So who
wants to bear the financial
burden of withdrawing invest-
ment from S.A.? No one. Which
brings us back to the problem
that Apartheid is profitable.

We don’t know how effective
economic sanctions can be.
Indeed, the problem in S.A. is
largely political, and our best
approach from an economic
standpoint may be to prevent
further investment there. But
we still won’t know what the
best solution to the Apartheid
problem really is. I just ask that
we not fool ourselve by thinking
we are helping solve the
problem by washing our hands
of it, or by sensationalizing its
news coverage.

Devon case open

To the Editor:

This concerns David Taylor’s
letter on the Devon case.

It is true that there has been
confusion between the proce-
dure for Professor Devon’s dis-
missal and her teaching ability,
but I do not believe anyone is
intentionally trying to bias the
situation. While it is also true
that a few people delight in
criticizing the administration,
most of us have better things to
do than play radical by jumping
on bandwagons and harassing
the administration for no rea-
son.

Some of us are genuinely
concerned, perhaps with the
Linden affair still in mind, that
Devon’s dismissal was promp-
ted by more than professional

found Devon’s lectures
extremely effective. But if lec-
turing quality is indeed reason

. for dismissal, then I can think

of a few more heads which also
should have rolled.

It seems highly possible that
Devon’s dismissal was promp-
ted by her somewhat controver-
sial nature, by her differences
with the administration, or by
the administration’s hesitation
to make a long-term commit-
ment to South Asian Studies by
giving tenure in that depart-
ment. If this is true, then
Devon’s professional reputation
has been slandered for unpro-
fessional reasons. I. see no
reason students should not
continue to question the admin-

a by istration concerning this.
