tions of the poor in the Da
vidson community, a, group
of students is engaged in a
clean-up, fix-up and paint-
up project at one of the
houses in the town.

The house, on west Depot
street, is inhabited by Mrs.
Maggie Mason, several oth-
er women, and about ten
children, and is no larger
than three dormitory rooms.

The painting idea began
when freshman Mike Scott
asked Rev. L. E. Ellis, pas-
tor of the United Presby-
terian Church in Davidson,
if there was some ‘‘tangible
way in which some students
could demonstrate their con-
cern for the ‘‘social need” in
the community.

Rev. Ellis suggested that
something could be done for
improvement of the housing,
and directed him to George
White, a worker in the col-
lege laundry. White told him
of the condition of Mrs. Ma-
sons house, which is owned
by the United Presbyterian
church, which does not haye-

Valparaiso Freshmen Get
Pass-Fail Course Proposal

Valparaiso, Ind.—(I.P.)—A
complete pass-fail system
with individual evaluations
for each student and with
comprehensive examinations
at the end of four years may,
ultimately be the product of
current discontent and ex-
perimentation with grading
systems. at Valparaiso Uni-
versity.

To accomplish these be-
ginning steps (based on the
findings of the recently re-
leased Task Force Report),
provide a maximum testing
program for pass-fail and
evaluations, and allow those
who want to take more pass:
fail to do so, VU should:

1, Retain the present grad-
‘ing system for all upperdi-
vision. and elective courses,
except in the cases specified

below.

2. Implement an all pass-
fail system for the lower di
vision courses. _

All tests and papers should
receive written evaluations
to clarify the symbol grade
given.

The whole freshman year
including elective should be
pass-fail.

3. Implement pass-fail in
all courses taken during the
interim term in a 4-1-4 cal-
endar and in all independent
study done during that term.

4. Allow all students who
wish to take all their courses
pass-fail at this university.

5. Develop a program of
gradual change to total pass-
fail “With evaluations and

Conclusion: If VU is to be
