Nadist
Alumnus
Shunned

By ALLEN LEWIS
Staff Writer

Almost any college can
boast of its Rhodes Scholars
and government leaders, but
how many schools can claim
the executive secretary of
the International Nudist Con-
vention?

It seems a shame that Da-
vidson has ignored one of
its most illustrious aumni:
Dr. Usley Boone.

Boone, of Brooklyn, N. Y.,
entered Davidson in 1899
with the class of: 1903. Al-
though he stayed for only
one year (he completed his
education at Brown Univer
sity), the Davidson spirit
seems to have had its ef-
fect on him.

After his graduation, Boone
became a Baptist minister.
Apparently the cloth did not
suit him, for he discarded: it
and became a nudist in 1931.

However, Boone's thoughts
were not all spent on nu-
dism; he also gave some
thought to international

policy.

In a speech in which he’

conceded defeat to his op-
ponent in the election of the
executive director of the
American Sunbathing Asso-
ciation, Boone argued that
nudism would end all war.

“It would be hard,” he
said, ‘‘to tell which man was
your enemy if all the soldiers
wore no clothes.”’

The last statement. should
rank Boone along’ with
Davidson's two other nation-
al leaders — Woodrow Wil-
son and Dean Rusk.

Though Rusk and Wilson
are certainly more well-
known, it is not every David.
son man who makes a suc-
cess out of a bare existence.

mystery which circulated
about the campus for almost
50 years after the turn-of-
the-century incident in which
a bedy was stolen from a
nearby grave shortly after

fn those days Davidson had
a medical school and with it
a demand for cadavers for
anatomy class. Cadavers
were expensive and had to
find.

So it is not entirely un-
believable that more than
one enterprising Davidson
scholar kept an eye on the
obituary column and _ pro-
cured his own cadaver from
the neighborhood cemetery.

Agreement has never been
reached as to whether the
body in this instance was
white or Negro, but the
family of the deceased sus-
pected grave-robbing, open-
ed the tomb and found it
empty.

According to the story, the
robbers (some sources be-
lieve they were students,
others say a professor) heard
that the family was turn.
ing the case over to legal
authorities and, so the story
goes, they dropped the body
down into one of the hollow
columns of old Chambers
along with a quantity of un-
slaked lime to erase the
evidence.

In 1929 the trustees voted
to pull down the four old
columns which had stood as
gaunt reminders of the
Chambers fire eight years
earlier. An examination of
the inside of the columns
revealed no skeletons and it
appeared that the skeleton
stories had ‘simply been a
hoax. -

Twenty years later Le-
Gette Blythe, foremost his-
torian of Mecklenburg County
and then a staff writer for
The Charlotte Observer, add-
ed new evidence which
séemed to prove that the
skeleton(s) had been re-
moved prior to the razing of
the columns.

The ‘Sherlock Holmes" of
Blythe’s tale was Brigadier
General Walter A. Dumas,
ret., of San Francisco, a
Davidson graduate of 1915.

Engulfing Fire
Fortified Spirit

By JiM COOLEY
Statt Writer
It was probably the most spectacular fire anyone
has ever seen in this part of Mecklenburg County. Peo-
ple miles away could see the smoke and flames, but
there was nothing anyone could do to save what had
been. the most imposing college building in the South.

The date was Nov. 2, 1921,
and the event was the fire
which almost totally destroy-
“ed old Chambers Building.
Discovered at § a.m., the
alarm was quickly given, but
the flames rapidly devour-
ed the pine timber which
formed the basic building
material.

A bucket brigade of stu-
dents and townspeople was
quickly formed but there was
little they could do except
to keep the fire from spread-
ing to nearby buildings.

Many students saved most
of their personal belongings
by putting them in trunks and
rolling the trunks down the
stairs or by throwing them
out of the windows to stud-
ents waiting below to carry
them to safety.

But the loss was still great
—an estimated $250,000, of
which $100.000 was recover-
ed by insurance, Destroyed
by the fire were the physics
laboratories and _ lecture
room, the college museum,
an old library, five class.
rooms and dormitory space
which accommodated 135
men.

As the fire died down, the
bugler sounded assembly and
President W. J. Martin de-
clared, according to THE
DAVIDSONIAN of the fol-
lowing week, ‘‘The spirit that
had made Davidson one of
the strongest colleges of the
South would assert itself in
the midst of the catastrophe
and that an even greater
Davidson would arise from
the ashes of Old Chambers
building.”

President Martin even
pledged that classes would
not be interrupted past that

morning, a pledge which no
doubt warmed the hearts of
those Davidson men of old
who, like their counterparts
of today, would rather attend
elass in the crisp December
air than miss a single lec-
ture.

The students then stood
with bared heads and sang
thé school alma mater, ‘‘O
Davidson.”

His “Mr. Watson” was class-
mate Ernest G. Campbell.

Resolved, to determine the
truth of the ‘‘cadaver.in-the-
column" tales they first
checked to see if there was
enough oxygen in the col-
umns and then one lowered
the other to the bottom. The
first column was empty but
the hext two yielded a part-
jal skeleton and a skull.

Further revelations btrou-
ght to light an earlier ex-
pedition to the base of the
columns. €. M. McKinnon,
‘95, in a letter to Blythe,
claimed that he and another
student had discovered a
skeleton in 1893 while ex-
ploring the columns.

But wherever the truth
lies, the only existing proof
of these episodes is a skull
sawed in half and partially
blackened by fire.

The skull—called ‘“‘Ichabod"’
—now rests in the relics case
at Pi Kappa Alpha house.

And, alas, there can never
be any more cadavers-in-
the-columns stories. Even if
.one of Davidson's ambitious
pre-‘meds decided to do
some advanced research in
human anatomy he wouldn't
find much of a hiding place

in the new Chambers’
columns. They are solid

Obelisks Shadow
Davidson’s Dead

It has been rumored that there are Davidson stu-
dents who can hardly wait to leave Piedmont North
Carolina. But, there are some alumni who have had
roots in Davidson for over a century. They may be
found in the.cemetery on North Main Street.

Obelisks stand watch over Davidson students who
remain in the shade of the town's water supply. ‘rhe

monuments twenty yards to
the left of the water tower:
were erected by the dead
students’ literary societies,

The students were turied
in Davidson because there
was no way to ship their
corpses home. Later it was
possible to send the bodies
home by train, but David-
son students had been dying
in the days before the rail-
roads reached Davidson,

Wilson Not Outstanding

By ROBBIE HOOKER
Editor-in-Chief

Woodrow Wilson, who be-
came a scholar, diplomat,
governor and 28th President
of the United States, was
pretty much a nobody as a
Davidson College student.

Despite the fact he spent
only a year here, compiling
a rather mediocre record,
Wilson is nonetheless the
college's ranking famous son.
Attempts to dethrone him
have been futile.

A few years ago, for in.
stance, there was a move.
ment to install in his place
Secretary of State Dean
Rusk, a bona fide graduate
and BMOC of the first order.
This mutinous movement was
quelled, however, and Rusk’s
popularity, tainted by LBJ
and Vietnam policies, has
since fallen on evil days.

Then there are always a
few irreverent souls léveling
various charges against ‘Wil-
son: that he couldn't take it
and dropped out, that he was
kicked out, that he was pro-
fane, that he was a fly, that
he wasn’t a fly, that he was

lazy, ete., etc.

For each charge, however,
Davidson divines have al-
ways provided an ‘answer,
and Wilson's place on the
historical marker across
from the post office (‘. . .
studied here  1873-1874"')
seems secure again—at least
for the time being.

Thomas Woodrow Wilson
—he was called Tommy here
—came to Davidson in the
fall of 1873, scrawny, shy
and so ill-prepared for col-
lege work that he spent most
of first. semester on acade-
mic probation.

Precisely why Wilson came
here like why he left-is
not clear, and the college
library's extensive collection
of Wilson biographies, Wil-
son writings, Wilson clipp-
ings and Wilson what-nots
does not say.

As a student, Wilson ap-
parently did the things most
students then did. He studied
some, read a lot, took long
walks, played for the fresh.
man baseball team, and
joined the Eumanean Liter.

ary Society.

As a baseball player. Wil-
son was something less than
a star. The captain of the
team, Robert Glenn--who
was to become governor of
North Carolina—reportedly
told him he was ‘‘too damn
lazy.”

The fact was, though, Wil-
son's health was probably
too delicate for the tiring
sport. And it was his health
—not the pressure or ex-
pulsion—that compelled. him
to leave school just before
final examinations.

He didn't come back
either. After staying out of
school for 15 months he went
to Princeton to finish his
undergraduate career.

But the legend has grown, .

and Wilson's rather abrupt
departure has been surround.
ed by fancy and (Colklore ever
since.

Most persistent has been
the story, undoubtedly the
creation of book-weary stu-
dents, that Wilson flunked
out.

Not so, reply his admirers.

A Thomas Wilson did flunk
out about that time. but he
was a Thomas A. Wilson.

And to another charge —
that Wilson was ‘‘profane and
vulgar’—they point to the
minutes of the Eu Society,
which show Wilson leading
the devotions.

Faculty of Davidson College
hereby recommends to The
Trustees of Davidson College
that the prohibition upon
dancing on the Davidson
campus be abolished.”

Such was part of the argu
ment of the faculty's request

in May, 1943, for the trustees’ -

approval of dancing on cam
pus.

Does the argument sound
familiar?

The action that followed
was familiar also it was.

almost a year before the.

first college recognized dance
was allowed in the town of
Davidson and almost two
years beforé a dance was
actually held on campus.
Davidson students today
often find their social én-
vironment drab. By com.
parison with the austere days
of the past. however, todays’
social life is full indeed.

During the 19th Century
the. Eumenean and Philan.
thropic. literary societies con.
trolled practically all extra
curricular activity.

There was no’ effective
Student body organization
until after 1900 but the socie-
ties expelled men from
membership for’ “intoxica-
tion’ and ‘“‘lying to the fac-
ulty."". Expulsion fromm the
society was very serious.

Davidson’s school colors
were pink and blue with Phi's
color blue and Eu’'s pink.

They were incorporated in.

the college's first yell: ‘‘Rah-
Rha-Rha, Run-Run Run,
Pink-and-Blue, Davidson.”

The social life of David-
son revolvea almost exclus-
ively around the campus be-
fore the War of Northern
Agression.

Students were often invit-
ed to dine at nearby planta.
tions and were never hesitant
to go, since such occasions
were infrequent and some-
times allowed them the plea
sure of female companion-
ship, something the students
of that age were as anxious
for, apparently, as the stud-
ents of today.

Recording her remember-
ances of bygone days the
wife of a college professor,
Mrs. Anne Simpson, described
social life at the college dur-
ing reconstruction as ‘‘al.
most nil . . . The students’
lives were very monoton-
ous.”

The principle deficiency in
the social realm during the

‘20's and ‘80's was’ a scar:
city 6f girls or “ladies,” as
they were always called by
proper Davidsonians.

The Gay Nineties brought
better times with more girls
in town than ever before.

The fitst Davidson College
dance was held in April 1944,
in the high school gym, and
the first dance on campus
was held in February 1945
in the gym, now the student
union,

“Arid so." wrote Dr. Chal-
mers G. Davidson, ‘‘te the
tunes of ‘I Dream of You’,
‘Always’, ‘More and More’,
and 'Rum and Coca Cola’.
Davidson College began to
sin to music.”

The tracks to Davidson
were not laid until 1860, just
in time to be torn up by in-
vading federal troops. It was
not. until 1870 that the tracks
were in for good. After that
Students were sure that if
they’ died at school they
could leave Davidson in body
as well as spirit.

The Davidson student of
yesteryear was not only buri-
ed differently than his mod-
ern sucessor, he died differ-
ently.

One James A. Hart, Class
of 1841. died of a liver ail-
ment in 1843. His last days
were recorded for posterity
in an ‘obituary by the Phi
society.

“He solicited many of
them (his friends), at  var-
ious ‘times to read portions
of the Holy Writ and sing
the praises of God who had
softened his dying pillow. . .

“Facing death calmiy he
frequently reminded them
of. the sinful consequences of |
neglecting the Bible re-
citations and sabbath serv-
ices.

Finally “his soul, resign-.
ed and at peace with God,
took her flight to that um
discovered country from
whose bourne no traveler re-
turns.”

And that’s how one faces
eternity in Davidson.

Morrison Clan’s
History Fertile

By ALLEN LEWIS
‘Staff Writer

Davidson is rich in southern history. Nowhere is
this more in evidence than in the family of the Rev
Robert Hall-Morrison, founder and first president. of

Davidson.

Morrison: had six daughters, all of whom married
men who were to become famous throughout the

South.

The oldest daughter, Isabella, married Daniel H.
Hill, who was then a professor of mathematics at.
Washington College — later Washington and Lee
University — and who became famous as the Gen.
Hill of the Confederate army.

Harriet, the first woman in the country to be
granted a patent on an architectural design for a
hexagonal house, married James Patton Irwin, a suc-
cessful businessman in Mobile, Alabama.

Irwin was the only one of the Morrison sons-in-
law who had money before the Civil War. A family
story has it that Mrs. Morrison always referred to him

as “Mr. Irwin.”

Eugenia became famous as the wife of Rufus
Barringer, a lawyer from Concord who rose to the
rank of general in the Civil War. After the war,. the
Barringers resided in Charlotte, where he resumed
his law practice, later serving in the state legislature.

The most famous of the matches began when Anna
visited her sister Isabella and her husband Gen. Hill.
There she met Thomas J. Jackson, professor of math-
ematics at the Virginia Military Institute.

It must have been love at first sight, for soon after
Anna became the wife of Thomas J. Jackson, better
known as Gen. Stonewall Jackson of the Confererate
Army. After her husband’s death, she lived in Char-
lotte until her death, when she was given the final
honor of being one of the few women given military

funerals.

Susan married Alphonse Avery, a Morganton
lawyer who rose to the rank of major during the war.
After the war, he resumed his practice and later be-

came a supreme court judge.

The last Morrison girl to marry was Laura. She
married Col. John E. Brown, a lawyer in Charlotte.

Col. Brown served several terms in the house
of representatives in Raleigh and later was solicitor
of the criminal court of Mecklenburg. He also served
as a trustee of the general assembly of the Presbyter-
ian Church in the United States.
