Bernard and Booker re-united 3000 miles av

By Witt RoBerson’

When Wayne Bernard and Nick Booker
get together, it doesn’t take long for the
conversation topic to shift to California bas-
ketball.

“You remember that guy?”

“Yeah, he was good. Where’s he goin to
school?”

“Man, that guy was funny.”

“You remember at that tournament...”

Bernard and Booker, who grew up about
thirty minutes from each other in the San
Diego area, first met in 1992 when they
played each other in a local 3-on-3 tourna-
ment—Wayne was 11 and Nick was 10. |

Their relationship kicked off on an omi-
nous note. “We got in a little scuffle with
each other and our parents had to break it up,”
Booker recalls with a laugh.

And with that scuffle, a friendship was
born.

After touring the country with High Five, ce
Booker’s high school coach Fentriss Winn

started a fall league team that featured both
Booker and Bernard. “I remember seeing
coach Shurina from Davidson at some of our
games,” says Booker. “Throughout the sum-
mer, I looked up to Wayne. He was like the
best unknown player. He was funny—al-
ways laughing.”

Bernard also has fond memories of his
summer with Nick. “I just remember he was
fearless on the court. Off the court, he was
real quiet, but easy to get along with.” *

And when Booker began weighing his
Division-I options, it was his close friendship
with Bernard that helped lure him to Davidson.

Booker describes Bernard’s influence as
“...one of the main reasons I came here.

“Tt always makes

Top 25: Michigan State will repeat

By WILL RoBERSON

—_—

1. Michigan State- The defending cham-
pions graduated two of the nation’s best in
Mateen Cleaves and Morris Peterson, but re-
load with two of the top 5 high schoolers in
the nation, PG Marcus Taylor and PF Zach
Randolph. Sophomore wing guard Jason
Richardson is ready for a breakout season
with the help of forwards Andre Hutson and
Mike Chappell — all of whom were over-
shadowed by Cleaves and Peterson during
the Spartans’ run to the title last year. This
team will take their losses early but will be
ready to dominate once again in March.

2. Duke- After losing ACC MVP Chris
Carrawell to the NBA, Duke adds G Chris
Duhon to an impressive blend of experience
and youth. With a starting line-up of Jason
Williams, Nate James, Mike Dunleavy, Shane
Battier and Carlos Boozer with Duhon, Nick
Horvath and Casey Sanders off the bench,
Coach K is poised to make a run at his first
title of the new millenium.

3. Arizona- The Cats boast the best
frontcourt in the nation, led by Richard

Jefferson, Michael Wright, Loren Woods —

and Luke Walton. Their backcourt isnit too
shabby either, with All-American candidates
Gilbert Arenas and Jason Gardner starting at
the guard positions. If it wasn’t for Stanford’s
Casey Jacobsen, Arizona’s starting five could
all make All-Pac 10.

4. North Carolina- New head coach Matt
Doherty inherits a loaded roster. Leading the
way is sophomore wing guard Joe Forte, who
can score seemingly at will. The post will be
manned by All-ACC candidates Brendan
Haywood and Kris Lang, with Julius Peppers
and Brian Bersticker backing them up. The

only question mark is at point guard, where .

freshmen Adam Boone and Brian Morrison

will compete for time with Ronald Curry.

5. Maryland- The Terrapins return all five
starters from a year ago, including the All-
ACC trio of Juan Dixon, Terence Morris and
Lonny Baxter. PG Steve Blake and SF Danny
Miller are underrated. Add 6-10 freshman
Chris Wilcox and transfer Byron Mouton
(Tulane’s leading scorer of 2 years ago), and
Maryland is ready for a run to the Final Four.

6. Stanford- The Cardinal will be one of
the most experienced teams in the land, start-
ing 4 fourth year players along with sopho-
more standout Casey Jacobsen. Jacobsen
will be counted on to replace the scoring of
the departed Mark Madsen and David
Moseley. The Collins twins will man the
post, and Mike McDonald returns at the point.

7. Kansas- The Jayhawks are as experi-
enced and talented as any team in the country.
Senior wing guard Kenny Gregory leads the
way, and will be helped by fellow seniors
Luke Axtell and Eric Chenowith. Junior PG
Jeff. Boschee returns, and sophomores Drew
Gooden and Nick Collison are ready for
breakout years.

8. Kentucky- Unexplainably stuck behind
the incompetent Jamaal Magloire a year ago,
6-10 sophomore Marvin Stone will have his
impact this year. Keith Bogans and Tayshaun
Prince provide an impossible match-up on
the wings. After failing to get in UNC, Jason
Parker finds himself in Lexington. The Wild-
cats definitely don’t lack star power. But who
will hold the: team together? PG Saul Smith
is definitely not the answer. One of the stars
has to step up and be a leader.

“9, Florida- This year’s Gators won’t sneak
up on anyone like last year’s NCAA runners-
up. The loss of Mike Miller and: Donnell
Harvey will hurt, but coach Billy Donovan
has great personnel for his run-and-gun sys-
tem. Junior Udonis Haslem will evolve from

_role player to star, and Brett Nelson will stake

his claim as one of the best point guards in the
nation.

10. Tennessee- The Volunteers are still on
the never-ending quest to prove that UT isn’t
a football school, and that it’s not Pat Summit’s
school. The 2000-01 edition is one of the best
ever at the school, one with Final Four poten-
tial. Junior F Vincent Yarborough helped
lead the Vols within minutes of the Elite Eight
last year, and will team up with senior PG
Tony Harris and senior F Isiah Victor to try to
get over the hump this year.

11. Seton Hall- Coach Tommy Amaker
has once again demonstrated his amazing
recruiting ability by bringing in three of the
nation’s best, 6-9 Eddie Griffin, 5-8 Andre
Barrett, and 6-6 Marcus Toney-El. Add those
three an impressive roster of C Samuel
Dalembert and guards Ty Shine and Darius
Lane, and the Pirates become one of the most
exciting teams in the country.

12. Connecticut- You could look at this
year as a rebuilding season for UConn after
losing Khalid El-Amin, Jake Voskuhl, and

Kevin Freeman. Don’t. The Huskies added ©

NYC guard Taliek Brown and 6-7 Caron
Butler to a roster boasting former role players
Albert Mouring, Edmund Saunders, and Wane
Souleymane that could once again capture
the Big East title.

13. Ilinois- New head coach Bill Self takes
over a team that returns all five starters from
last year’s 22-10.team. All-American candi-

date Cory Bradford and 6-10 sophomore cen- -

ter Brian Cook will lead a very young team.

14. UCLA- Sophomore Jason Kapono with-
drew-his name from the NBA Draft, and will
return to lead a young Bruin squad. C Dan
Gadzuric can be downright dominating if he
stays out of foul trouble, and reliable Earl
Watson handles the point. Expect newcomer

TJ Cummings, son of 18-year NBA veteran _

Terry Cummings, to have a huge impact.

15. Notre Dame- All-American Troy

Murphy is obviously the key. But the rest of ©

the team is going to have to exploit the
constant double-teams Murphy will demand.
Oklahoma transfer Ryan Humphrey will add
muscle in the post, and junior F Brian Graves
and sophomore G Matt Caroll provide the
perimeter threat.

16. Arkansas- The Hogs surprised every-
one with their run through the 2000 SEC
Tournament. They will look to build on that
success with the help of 6-9 sophomore:Joe

Johnson, a favorite for SEC Player of the -

Year.

17. Utah- The Utes are suddenly more
athletic than ever. Former McDonald’s All-
American Britton Johnsen is back from his
church mission, Travis Spivey has trans-
ferred from Georgia Tech, and’C Chris Bur-
gess arrives after two seasons with Duke.

18. Cincinnati- The Bearcats also return
only one starter from last year’s team, PG
Kenny Satterfield. He will team with junior
Steve Logan in an impressive backcourt.
Coach Bob Huggins continues to drink from
the junior college well, adding five newcom-
ers, three of which played JC ball last year.

19. DePaul- The Blue Demons are
Cincinnati’s only real competition in Con-
ference USA. The departure of Quentin
Richardson will allow juniors Bobby
Simmons and Lance Williams to blossom in
the paint.

20. ‘Wisconsin- Coach Dick Bennett’s
slow-down style helped the Badgers advance

all the way to the Final Four a year ago. |

Wisconsin returns all five starters from last
season.
