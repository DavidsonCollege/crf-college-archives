Davidson

Defeated

By Tough Spiders

By CHARLES SLAGLE
Staff Writer

Richmond's sprinters proved
to be too much Tuesday as the
Spiders beat the Davidson track
team 80-74.

Davidson however looked
gooa in defeat, and Coacn
Sterling Martin was” pleaseu
with his team's performance.
The team is young, and their
performance Tuesday enables
Martin to go into their
triangular meet at Appalachian
against Appalachian and V.M.I.
with optimism.

Two Daviason school records
were broken in this meet.

Eppa Rixey led a sweep of the
high jump by breaking the
record with his jump of 6°5".
Tim Rogers who just started
working out came in second at
six feet. John Stanfield placed
third.

The other record was
established by Jeff Diller in the
hammer throw in which he
placed second. His throw was
f07'2"’. Diller also placed third
in the javelin.

ticky Ben was the only Wild-
cat who won two events in the
meet. He won the mile and then
led a sweep of the three mile.
Rick Deal and Ron Clark came
in second and third in the three
mile race

Besides sweeping the high
jump and the three mile David-
son also swept the 440 and the
discus. Larry Hill led the way in
the 440 followed by Chris Gomez
and Tim Walker. Walker and
Hill also ran in the mile relay
which Davidson won.

David Crumpler won the
discus with Steve Shankweiler
second and Allen Shaberg
placing third. All three threw
the discuss over 130 feet.

Bob Lautensack ran a gutsy
race and won the 880 in a time of
2:02.3. Woody Van Meter con-
tinued from last year and
won the pole vault at 131”
which is two inches below his
own school record.

The meet was lost however at
the sprints where Richmond's
Jim Detwiler and Pete
Macheras dominated. Det-
weiler won both the high hur-
dies and the 440 intermediate
hurdies while Macheras won
the 100 and 220.

Wavidson coulda only muster
thirds in the 100 and 220 by
Mark Connors, who like all the
Davidson inters. was 440
man until this year. Greg Love

second in the high hur-
dies and Dave Peaco came in
third in the intermediate hur-
dies at 58 seconds, only one
second off the school record.
