DC Struggles to Cope with Pressure

‘Lots of students who come to Davidson don’t
have a realistic outlook about what it is like here
academically,”’ said Chief of Psychological Ser-

be pretty much

like high school. Davidson is clearly an elite in-
stitution, and you need to recognize that the com-
petiton is very severe at a school like this,’’ Powell
said to an audience of about 100 at a symposium
Wednesday, Dec. 11, to discuss ways to cope with
academic pressure at Davidson.

Powell met several times with students and
faculty during the day, and the symposium closed
with a small group discussion of possible ways to

ease academic pressure.

Dean of Students Will R.
Terry, who introduced Powell,
told the morning audience that
talking about pressure at
Davidson is like trying to talk
about the weather.

“This problem has _ been
brought to my attention rather
crucially this year. Some
pressures here are useful, but
others are rather foolish,”’
said Terry.

‘Powell believes that much
of the problem with academic
pressure. is internally
generated, although he
acknowledges the influence of
parents and friends.

He also said that professors
who don’t realize or don’t care
about the effect of grades on
students add to the problem.

‘However, the problem
develops from the people who
come to schools like David-
son,’’ emphasized Powell.
“These people are used to
being in the top 10 percent of
their class, for the most part.
But when they get to David-
son, only 10 percent .of them
can be in the top of their
class.”

Powell was impressed with
the academic standards that
Davidson sets for its students,
and does not.believe that these
standards should be. lowered.

The quality of professors
also impressed him. ‘‘Look at
the faculty here. The majority
of them have Phd’s from
major universities: in their
fields,” he said.

Powell believes that much
of the problem of coping with
pressure at Davidson is reflec-
ted across the country.
‘Students are increasingly
concerned about good grades
and are ly
when they don’t get them.

Depression and the fact that
more students are being
caught cheating on exams are
indications of students. at-
tempting to deal with the
pressure they’re feeling.”’

Since the late 1960's, a num-.

ber of significant changes
have taken place in students
and faculty, according to
Powell. Students seem more
interested in doing well
academically and in what they
will be .doing with their
educations later on.
Generally, the number of

majors has dropped, although
Powell admitted that this
doesn’t apply to Davidson.
Fewer students are talking
to one another than before.
The Harvard psychologist
visited several dormitories
the night before the sym-
posium, and he commented
that there were a lot of people

behind doors.

He was also surprised at the
number of students studying
in the library early on: Wed-
nesday morning.

Powell believes that fewer
people are getting stoned than
before, although alcohol con-
sumption is still high. He ad-
ded that religion is beginning
to reach back into the student
population. Across the coun-
try, the casual sex relation-

‘*Par-

pressures; it provides a
catharsis.”

Powell added, ‘It gives us an .

opportunity for fellowship and
permits one to disciplirie one’s
instincts.’’

Co-education also changes a
college for the better, but the
speaker added that women
face a particularly acute set of
pressures.

“There is a tencency of

women who are placed in a co-
ed setting to be a little less
assertive academicalty. In a
co-ed school, women are prone
to become second-class
citizens.”

Powell cited exaimples of
women who receiveidegrees

“Professors remember the

in the 1960’s and miss the en-
thusiasm-the elan. Also, you
must remembeg,. that op-
portunities for fdculty
movement are not as easy
these days, and professors are
fighting with feelings of
stagnation and depression.”’

Powell advised students to
express their feelings to
faculty members. ‘‘Take a
faculty member to lunch,”’ he
said. ‘“‘They need to be told
how they are doing; they need
to be approved of.’

Concluding the. morning
session, Powell commented,
“You're victims of your own
choice here, whether you’re
students, faculty or ad-
ministrators.’’ He advised
several ways for students to
ease the feelings of pressure.

“Humanize the rigor of
study. Study more ef-
fectively. Most of you come

faculty members to discuss
ways to ease unnecessary
academic pressure at David-
son. Later in the afternooon,
he met with students and a
handful of professors in Cham-
bers banquet hall for an in-
formal discussion session.

The conversation centered
around possibilities for
students at Davidson to ex-
periment with different
educational experiences like
JYA, career service, or sim-
ply travelling for a term or so.

Students expressed scep-
ticism over doing these things
at Davidson. Many were
dismayed because they had
never taken the chance to sup-
port themselves for a while,
and felt that they were not
able to apply what they were
learning at Davidson.

One student who had taken
six years off from Davidson to
work with Vista, and to travel
through Asia and other places,
affirmed that the academic

psychologist reiterated how
impressed he was with David-
son, although he acknow-
ledged the — seriousness
of the problem of pressure. “‘A
lot of people don’t feel that
they are getting an education
on the way to their 3.5’s.
What’s missing are-: op-
‘portunities for personalization
of knowledge.’

Powell cautioned that his
impressions were superficial
since he had been at Davidson
for only a day or. two.
However, he encouraged more
thought and action directed
toward enriching the
curriculum.

The psychologist was par-
ticularly. surprised at the
timidity of the students at
Davidson to try new things» He
also « emphasized the
predominance of. abstract
discussion and reflective
thinking during his visit.

“*You’ve got to realize that

Early in the afternoon an

world seems more relevant
for him.

A student who had been on
JYA last year said that the ex-
perience was frightening in
some ways, but there was an
incredible feeling of freedom.

Powell urged students to
take an active role in con-

pressure. ‘‘Action must be

He added that the faculty at
Davidson has a= greater

capacity for change than

realize.
