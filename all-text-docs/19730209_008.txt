Have vou ever wondered what it takes to work as a
school mascot?

Dave Bender, the Davidson Wildcat, will tell vou it
takes about 10 to 15 pounds of sweat per game.

“Sure it gets hot in there.” said the sophomore
math major. **But it has its advantages.”

The biggest advantage Bender sees in it is the
positions he obtains.

“It is a great observation place.” he said. “You can
really watch the girls. It is just like wearing a pair ot
sun glasses.

The job Bender holds down is physically strenuous.
The paper mache Wildcat head weighs 25 pounds.

Bender really loves the job, though.

The little kids love it too. I give away at least three
or four autographs per game.” he explained. *'I sign
them ‘The Cat’.”’

As one might expect, transporting a 25-pound head
to away games might present problems. That is
especially true since it will not fit into the trunk of any
car.

Usually Bender simply ties it into the trunk. But
when Davidson traveled to William and Mary last
month, it was raining and he could not tie it down in
the trunk.

So he and a helper squeezed it into the front seat of a
car and drove to Williamsburg with the head next to
the driver.

“Try that for five hours,’ laughed Bender.

This is Bender's second year as mascot for the
Wildcats. He has doned the old warmup suit and
headed for many contests since the middle of the 1971-
72 basketball season.

He first became interested in college mascots while
he was a high school student in Pennslyvania at
Springfield High. He made frequent trips to the
Philadelphia Palestra. where the St. Joseph's
Hawk, one of the all-American mascots, operates.

‘One of my biggest thrills as The Wildcat was last
year when we went to the NIT in New York. I got to
meet my idol, the St. Joe Hawk, while we were
there,’ said Bender.

‘IT would love to go back to the Palestra and do a
game.”

Maybe his feelings will be taken into consideration
when future schedules are being compiled.

One of the abilities that is required of most mascots
is to perform in the halftime one-on-one contests. The
Wildcat is doing far better at this than his team, 12-8
on the year, is doing.

Bender is undefeated thus far in this competition.
He beat the Indian from William and Mary, tied the
well-known Duke Blue Devil, grabbed a scoreless tie
with the South Carolina Gamecock, and swamped the
Princeton Tiger and N.C. State Wolf with forfeits.

‘The Wolf and the Tiger claimed that they could not
shoot in their costumes. They should try doing it with
a 25-pound Wildcat head on their shoulders,’’ Bender
challenged.

At any rate, Davidson has a mascot that it can be
proud of.

It takes a lot of determination to do a job that gets
little recognition for providing so much school spirit.

Perhaps there will be a time when The Wildcat pulls
a trick similar to the Blue Devil, who has been known
to roost on a goalpost at football games and gingerly
jab refs in the posterior at other contests.

Prediction Time

Look for the Cats to snatch one from The Citadel
tomorrow by at least 12 points. .

As for the Furman contest, I am going for the
hometown boys by three in a 92-89 thriller.

After the two wins, the Cats will not choke in the big
one against Appalachian, winning by 25 or more in a
run away.

It looks like another regular season title for the Cats
from here.

Tankers Lose In Tough Meets

By JIM SITTERSON
Sports Editor

The swimming team entered
into what Coach Ted Severn
said would be the hardest part
of the season last week.

After an easy win over John-
son C. Smith last week, the
team was defeated by Augusta
by a score of 70-32.

“That's what happens when a
subsidized team meets an un-
subsidized team," summed
Severn's opinion of the meet.

‘I don't feel that we did badly
against Augusta, they were just
too strong for us. As a matter of
fact, just about everyone
lowered their times,’ he added.

Severn also noted that several
of the team members were
unable to compete because of
the flu.

Tuesday, the team dropped
what he termed, “the tightest
meet of the year,” to Ap-

palachian by a 64-49 score.

The final score was somewhat
deceptive as the meet was
decided by the last two events.

Severn felt that the team
turned in its best performance of
the year.

“If we had just gotten a few
breaks, we could have won the
meet,’' Severn said.

This feeling was echoed by
breaststroker Rusty Saylor.

“I feel that we could beat
them if we swam them again, it
was just a real close meet,”
Saylor said.

Severn cited several in-
dividuals for their efforts in the
meet.

**Pete Alfred did an excellent
job for us in the short freestyle
events. John Knox did an out-
standing job in the diving for us
too,’ Severn stated.

He also said that he was very
pleased with Rusty Saylor and
Deren Ferris, both of whom had

Davidson has won 67 of its last
68 games in Johnston Gym
Their win streak of 13) games
over the The Citadel dates back
to the 1961-62 season.

The Wildcats still pace the
Southern Conference in scoring
and in shooting percentage.
though the later statistic has
tapered off somewhat in recent
games. The Wildcats are now
hitting on 49.4 percent of their
shots from the floor. A 60 per-
cent night against VMI in their
last outing broke the recent
slump.

The conterence-leading
scoring Mark ts $4.2 points per
game. The Cats will direly need
most of that total in any of their
remaining contests.

Presently the Cats are second
in the conterence with a 6-1
record. They are seeking their
sixth consecutive regular
season crown and eight in the
last nine years.

Junior winger John Falconi
leads the Cat scoring with a 16.4
average. Greg Dunn, with 20
against VMI. is up to 14.3. T.
Jay Pecorak and Mike Sorren-
tino round out the double figure
scorers at 11.4 and 10.5, respec-
tively.

Larry Horowitz leads three
Cats that are shooting at fifty
percent or betler. He is hitting
at 51.6 while Dunn is at 51.1 and
Falcom at 50.0

Horowitz has also provided
strong board play in the last
tour games with 11.9. 13 and 11
rebounds in those contests

missed several meets with the
flu.

Two school records were
broken in the meet, by Jack
Doscher and John Scholer.

set a new record in
the 200 yard backstroke with a
time of 2:15.8, and Scholer
broke the 1000 yard freestyle
mark with a time of 11:39.3.

Severn was especially
pleased with Scholer's time.

“He just clipped it by several
seconds without much effort,"
he noted.

The team is currently
preparing for their biggest
meet of the season according to
Severn. They will swim against
Emory in Atlanta today in
what Severn expects to be the
closest meet of the year.

“Right now our record is 3-3,"
Severn said, ‘‘but based on what
the team has shown in the last
couple of meets, I still predict a
winning season.”
