Davidson Hit For Recruiting Violation

Following the tradition of
fellow North Carolina Univer-
sities Duke and N. C. State.
Davidson College has been put
on probation by the .NCAA
Rules Committee for alleged
recruiting violations.

The announcement came af-
ter a three week investigation
which was done in complete
secrecy. The probation period

took effect on Jan. 1, 1973 and
extends until Jan. 1, 1975.
During this time no Davidson
team will be eligible to compete
in any post-season athletic ;ac-
tivities.
Most noted of

the effects

which this ruling will have on
the Wildcat athletic program is

prominence and regional com-
petition. The club will not be
eligible for the NCAA Eastern
Regionals nor the NIT.

The violation involved a new
football recruit from Rose Bud
High School in Pasadena.
California, who had been en-
tertained by Coach Dave Fagg
on campus the first weekend in
December.

Davidson will lose any chance for post season play due to a recruiting violation.

White Named New Cat

In a surprise administration
shuffle this week, Director of
Admissions H. Edmund White
has been appointed tennis and
soccer coach for the Davidson
Wildcats, and Sandy Carnegie,
head of the Wildcat Fund, has
been named White's successor.

Both White and Carnegie will
begin their new jobs im-
mediately. although the new
positions will not be final until
they receive trustee approval in
May.

The changes were announced
this week by Vice President for
Academic Affairs John M.
Bevan who called the shuffle
“the most exciting ad-
ministrative decision made in
my years at Davidson, short
though they may be.”’

Bevan said White's ap-
pointment was made at the

special request of College
President Samuel R. Spencer
Jr.

Spencer said that he knew
White could handle the
coaching responsibilities
because of the fine per-
formances he put in during the
IMAC tennis :tournament last
year. White and Spencer
represented the faculty in that
tournament.

“‘T've been trying to get Ed in-
to the athletic department for
years,’ Spencer commented.
‘and this looked like the perfect
job for him.”

‘He's a natural coach." Spen-
cer added. ‘‘He’s a great tennis
plaver. and does a great job of
teaching the game. He did won-
ders for my playing last year.”

White said he plans to start
putting the netters through
their paces early next month in
preparation for what he termed
“a uniquely difficult season”.

He said that although he
knows few of the team mem-
bers personally, he intends to
meet them all shortly.

Carnegie was chosen to
replace White, according to
Bevan, because his job was ter-
Mminated due to the ad-
ministrative decision to cut off
all athletic scholarships.

‘Since we will have no more
football scholarships to worry
about. we figured we'd just turn
the fund's operation over to
Zack Long,’ Bevan explained.

Bevan said that he felt Car-
negie would be able to bring a
new look to the admissions
department.

‘He's been out looking for two
types of people--big and rich--
for so long that the change will
do him good,”’ Bevan added.

Carnegie intimated, however,
that he may join coaches Dave
Fagg and Terry Holland in
resigning to protest the cutting
off of scholarships.

Members of the soccer team
were still too shocked by the
decision to respond properly.

‘‘T really haven't the slightest
idea what to say,’ said Tom
Tornee. ‘‘We weren't ready for
that.”

Tornee went on to express
concern for White's ability to

Fagg had the 5-10, 195 lb. cor-
nerback introduced, to the
delight of Wildcat football
reofers, at the Clemson game
during halftime.”

Following the game. he was
given a night-on-the-town with a
few of the Davidson alumni and
the cheerleader of his choice
Her name was not disclosed by
the investigatory committee.

The committee charged that
the unnamed prospect was
given a Dayidson, bumper
sticker free 6 Charge. which is
in direct violation of NCAA
regulations

Fagg attempted to pay for the
sticker, but the committee
would not allow this either

While pleading innocent to the
charges, Fagg burst into tears
at the thought of not being able
to play in any of the 1974 bowl
games.

Between sobs he commented,
‘I thought the boys would really
be ready for it next year. Even
though our schedule is one of
the toughest in the country, |
thought we could accept a bid to
either the Gator or the Astro-
Bluebonnet Bowl. But now the
bubble has burst.”

As another gusher of tears
flowed from the weary and
strained eyes of the usually
calm, and solemn man, he
stammered for a moment and
then continued, saying, ‘‘It is
not really me that I am so
worried about. It is our team.
They are a great bunch of guys
and they try with all they have.
They deserve a bow!."’

The sad man turned and star-
ted for the door, when Terry

coach the game. ‘‘I just don’t
know how much ne knows about
soccer ,’’ Tornee stated. ‘‘In fact
I've never even seen the man.
Come to think of it, I've never
heard anyone else say they've
seen him either."’

Netter Bill Allen had a dif-
ferent view, however. He ap-
plauded White's appointment as
a far-sighted move on the part
of the administration.

‘‘He should really help
recruiting,’ Allen pointed out.

ROTC STAFFERS IRATE

Bevan Guns Down Marksmen;
Safety, Expenditures Cited

Vice President of Academic
Affair John Bevan announced
Monday that the Davidson rifle
team will have to do without
what he deemed, ‘‘the  un-
necessary rifles and ammuni-
tion.”

Bevan stated that the ad-
ministration had based the
decision on the lack of safety
precautions and overall ex-
penses of the team.

“IT am personally all for the
rifle team. I think that they are
doing a great job,’ Bevan said.

“But,”’ he continued, ‘‘the
safety factor is one which I can-
not bring myself to ignore.
Why. just imagine if some
clumsy dolt got in the way of
one of those bullets.”

Bevan stressed that the
safety issue was not the
predominant factor in forcing

the decision. Apparently, the
administration felt that it could
no longer support the rising
costs of the team.

“You cannot possibly have
any idea what those damn
trigger tuggers are costing us at
the present,”’ Bevan said.

“Rifles, ammunition. and all
that other stuff are just too ex-
pensive,’ Bevan emphatically
stated.

The team will not
be eliminated however. The ad-
ministration presented several
alternatives to rifles and
bullets and let the team choose
the one they liked the best.

The plan adopted by the tar-
get ticklers is *‘a compromise,
between disbanding the team
and still having a team.” ac-
cording to a team member who

“TIL break his neck.” cried
the voice. Then the door swung
open and Holland faced Fage

“Why? screamed Hollland
“What the devil did you think
vou were doing?”

Fagg stammered and the
raging basketball mentor
lunged at his throat. Luckily Bo
Brickles and Jerry Kroll were
there to pull Holland away

They took Holland to

Fagg quickly summoned his

Later. Holland was available
for comment in his office. His
reaction to the incident’ was
quite apparent.

‘| thought this was the most
outrageous action ever con-
ceived,’ explained the former
Davidson great. ‘‘We have been
robbed of a shot at UCLA for the
next two years. It is
ridiculous."

Holland was in his typical
fiery and nervous mood.
Brickles was calming him
down when a call came in from
Furman University.

the

Holland would not discuss the
other half of the conversation,
but from the tone of his voice,
its volume and its content
(which was not printable under
the code of the American Jour-
nalism Association), the logical
deduction was that a Furman
official had phoned _ to
congratulate Holland on the
recent recognition.

With the news of this un-
fortunate disaster, some of the
freshmen and sophomore ball
players are considering tran-
sferring to other institutions.
Officials from other schools, in-
cluding Duke, Wake Forest,
Alabama and South Carolina
have been in contact with a few
players who wish to remain
unknown at this time.

At the present time, there are
no direct plans under way to
replace Fagg at the head
coaching position. Athletic
director Tom Scott did say,
however, that he had been in
touch with a few prospects ‘*just
in case the situation rises."’

The player who was sup-
posed to have caused the
trouble still remains unknown.

did not wish to be identified.

The plan calls for the team to
use Daisy BB guns and painted
styrofoam targets. Both targets
and BBs will be reusable.

In conjunction with the plan
adopted by the team, the work
study department has an-
nounced a program in which
students may help to pay their
own way through school by
picking BBs out of the targets.

The college ROTC Depart-
ment issued an irate statement
which called the move “a
humiliating comedown to the
fine art of shooting.”

“After all.’ conimented
Colonel Virgil Foster, head of
the ROTC program, “that
would be one hell of a way torun
a war,wouldn’'t it?” .
