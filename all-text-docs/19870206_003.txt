Alcohol support group formed for local families

By BETSEY BRYAN
Davidson’s recently formed
Alcohol Support Group provides
an opportunity for children of An

member who is an: alcoholic. °

Working in the Dean of Students’
Office, I’ve run into students who
could use a program like tha

alcoholic parent or parents to meet
and discuss concerns about theif
families.

Harriette Root, Assistant
Dean of Students, saw the need
for such a group at Davidson.

“Alcoholics Anonymous has a
brance called Adult Children of
Alcoholics’ for older people
who’ve grown up with a family

at Davidson,” she said.

. Root developed the idea for
the Alcohol Support group last fall
after speaking with Campbell
Perry, a drug -counselor who

works at Davidson on Wednesday
nights, and Debbie Brinton, a
freshman feturning to college
after working for several years as

a registered nurse.
Root credits Brinton with

While working as an nurse,
Brinton served for three years as

the director of a detoxification
program at a nearby mental health
center. During this time, she did a
lot of family counseling for the
relatives of alcoholics.

“I became interested in this
type of work because my father is

the anxiety I experienced when I
left for college for the first time
and my dad was drinking. It’s
hard to be away and have to

worry, not knowing what's going -
. on in your family.”

Although Brinton organized
the group, she denies that she is its
leader.

“| think this is more a sharing
group,” she said. “Everybody

there is a leader, really. we re all

nivitig? There’s no pressure.
It’s just a forum for voicing our
concerns, supporting others, and
receiving support from others who
understand.” :

Now ‘five weeks old, the
Davidson Alcohol Support Group
meets at 4 p.m. on Wednesdays in
the Wilson Room of the Union.
All are invited.to attend.

Humanities grant paves way for student fellowships

By GEORGE KURANI

The, Humanities departments
at Davidson will be diversifying
starting this summer thanks to
changes made possible by a grant
from the Pew Corporation. In re-
sponse to this grant, the Pew Pro-
gram Committee is currently in
charge of overseeing programs
designed to strengthen and expand
these departments at Davidson in
a variety of ways. cy

A little over a year ago, the
PEW Corporation invited 30 col-
leges to submit proposals for pro-
grams in fields of humanities.
President Kuykendall and the
Academic Vice President ap-
pointed a number of faculty mem-
bers to work on a committee that
would submit a grant proposal to
ithe Pew Corporation. These facul-
ty members include Dr. Hansford
Epes, Dr. Tony Abbott, Dr.
David Kaylor, Dr. Lance Stell,
Dr. Cynthia Lewis, and Dr.
Robert ay auamh:

we Davidson’ ‘lwas among only
half of the colleged. ighosen to get

close to the full grant offered by
the Pew Corporation. The grant
totals $500,000 which will be
spent over the course of a five-
year program at the college.

The Pew Program Committee

was reformed after Davidson was °

granted funds. The same faculty
members who had written the re-
quest for the grant remained on the
committee, and two new student
representatives, were added this
October: junior Caryn Coppedge.

Three major areas of interest
have been selected by the Pew
Program Committee. The first is

to develop _ interdisciplinary
courses and seminars in the
Humanities © departments for

seniors. With these courses,
seniors could learn a great deal by

. combining. such courses. as, En—
‘. glish and Religion. This step of

the program will give seniors a
much wider field of study in what-
ever area of the Humanities they
wish to pursue. |

The second area that the Pew
Committee has chosen to eatin

concerns Capstone courses. These
courses will be geared for seniors
majoring in a specific area of the
Humanities departments,
Capstone courses will serve to
bring together many aspects in-
volved in a Humanities major.
The Pew Committee has spent
a great deal of time working on the
third area of development since it
will probably prove to be’ ex-
tremely important for students in-

volved with the Humanities.

Starting this summer, mostly ris-
ing seniors and some rising
juniors will work with a member
of the faculty on a one to one basis
in research. The student will work
on a “junior researcher” and ap-
prentice in the project with a fac-
ulty member, both playing an im-
portant part in the project. Fund-
ing for.the work..comes from: the
Pew Grant; which will support a
number of research fellowships.
The fellowships will last between
six and eight weeks in the summer
and ‘will be supported by up to
$1800 for this time period.

Dr. Epes is acting chairman

this year for the Pew Committee.
He said that the goal of the com-

mittee is to get good students in-_

volved with some of the activities
that Davidson’s faculty works on.

“Working on research with a
faculty member is an excellent
way to strengthen and excite the

' junior and senior years for stu-

dents majoring in some field of the
humanities,” Epes said. “Going
out and learning with the faculty
should serve to challenge inter-
ested students and get them more
involved with their majors. We
hope to have as many as four stu-
dent-faculty groups for this sum-
mer, and we expect as many as ten
groups by our fifth year.”

> Coppedge feels that the new
programs will definitely improve

-the offerings for upper-classmen
majoring in humanities depart-

ments. “I feel that our programs
have the potential to meet many of
the needs of Davidson students,”
she said. “Humanities depart-
ments do need Capstone courses
to tie in different facets of inde-
pendent majors and the opportu-

nity for student research in a topic
of his choice is very unique.”
Capstone and _ interdiscipli-
nary courses along with a variety
of seminars, will appear as part of
Davidson’s regular curriculum
next year. The committee is cur-
rently in the process of getting the
whole program into place for the
upcoming years, and is currently
ready to accept applications for
summer research with faculty
members. Information for stu-
dents who wish to apply will be
available in Dr. Robert Williams’

_ office. Applicants are encouraged

to apply at this time.

Dr. Epes anticipates teams of
students and faculty applying for
the program in the future. “This is
exactly what we’re looking for,”
he said. “I anticipate that this pro-
gram will be around for a while
and become a part of the oppor-
tunities that we‘offer to Davidson
students. We think that our pro-
gram will be part of a very excit-
ing experience and I hope that we
can read and consider many
applicants.”
