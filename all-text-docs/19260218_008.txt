Parker's talk was entitled “Vestiges of
Intolerance.” Tt dealt with the remnants
of the more cruel and harsh intolerance
of former periods of history which are
prevalent today, Among the sub-topies

Hollingsworth spoke on “Thy Man

There has been a very animated war-
fare in the columns of the “Old Gold and
Black” and the “Tarheel,” over the re-
cent defeat handed to Carolina’ by the
Wake Forest quintet. The trouble arose
when Carolina appeared to rob the glory
of victory from the Deacons by various
and sundry alibis. They attributed their
victory to luck and to the small court
which was entirely new and.unfamiliar to
the University crew. A harsh and bitter
reply followed from Wake Forest in
which they accused Carolina of being a
poor loser. The Deacons stated that any
team in the South would have lost under

The first stage of the Fourth Corps Area
Rifle Match was fired during the past week.
Previous to this time 15 of the students had
been chosen to represent Davidson.

The 10 highest scores are used to represent
Davidson in the match. Davidson made
1,819 out of a possible 2,000. Buford Webb,
FE. E. Brown, and T. L. Short tied for first
| place with scores of 186 each.

As the scores have not been received from
other colleges in the Fourth Corps Area, it
is not known how high Davidson will rank
in the contest. However, Captain Daugh-

erty reports that things look encouraging |
and believes that Davidson will place high in|
