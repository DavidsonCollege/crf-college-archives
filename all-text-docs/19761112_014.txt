on Sunday. From this session
players are chosen to make up
three levels for the regional

the top regional team will

a slow game the women
showed good style and came
away with an expected win,
3-0.

Belle Erdman and Martha
MacGill each scored once and
the final goal was made by an
error on the part of the foot of
the opposing fullback.

The second team the women

competed against was Pfeiffer ~

with a Davidson upset of 3-1.
Roberts commented on the
game saying, ‘‘it was a very
tough game in which both
Beth Tanner and Mary Grey
Gilchrist were injured. But, it
was definitely our best game
of the season with every
one working smoothly and
aggressively to contribute to
the win.’’.

The last game played on
Saturday was against East
Carolina with Davidson losing
0-1. Some discrepancy arose
concerning the score which
was made by an illegal move
on the part of the East
Carolina forward.

Cameron lodged a complaint
claiming an obstruction on the
forward but the officials had
not seen the score and so could
not invalidate it.

Several other factors also
contributed to the loss. Al-
though the Davidson team
had many shots on goal they
could not get past a very

Also the-injuries sustained
earlier in the day during the
game against Pfeiffer slowed
down the women.

Overall it was a successful
tournament and Roberts had
these comments to make. “I
think we have improved 100

We ended up surprising most
of our competition with such
an effective new team. I am
looking forward to working
with the team next ',fall to
improve our record even
more.”

Roberts and Cameron will
travel to Converse College

with the Deep South team #2
