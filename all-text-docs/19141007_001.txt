is nothing carried on under the auspices
of the Y. M. C. A. at Davidson: which
vives more universal pleasure than the
-Lyceum course. It is confidently expect-
ed that the Lyceum course for, this year
is going to be the best that has ever
been given here. “The course is made up
of the very best numbers obtainable.

composed of four brothers. cach of whom

and in addition to this has had years of
experience, “he result is a quartet
which has made a wondertul hit every-
where it has played.

After hearing the Weatherwax Broth-
ers Quartet, Dr. Frank bE. Hirsch. Pres-
ident of Charles City College. Iowa.
had this to say: ; ;

“Having listened to the Weatherwax
Quartet on vilrious occasions and- again
vesterday evening in the cancern at the
opera house, 1 desire to express my ap
preciation of the high, quality: ot their
work. {Phe points that appeared to me
the most pleasing vesterday evening were
the strength of the -eparate voices, and
the agreeable harmony and ‘blend as
they joined in the quartet. “Che read’
ings were well given and were eniosable
because they represented bath the serous
and humorous in proper variety.

This is one of the many. splendid rec
ommendations with which the Wearher
wan Quartet comes to Davidson. “The
success of the. Lyeeum course depends
largely upon the number of tickets sold

son in Davidson see this opening num-
ber of the course. and it he has not vet

Clemson Powerless Be-
fore Red and Black.

Fetzer’s Team Holds “Tigers” to
Scoreless Tie.

In one of the hardest contested games
ever witnessed on the Davidson gridiron
the “Red and Black Machine,” with a
great revival of the old-time Davidson
fighting spirit, held the mighty Clemson
“Tigers” last Saturday to a nothing to
nothing tie, “Vhe result: is considered
and conceded by Clemson supporters to
be a great victory for Davidson, because
Clemson has 3 to t adds on the Presby-
terians, in putting out a team. With a
student body ot almost tooo, that triples
the number at Davidson, Coach “Bob”
Williams had a squad of twice as many
to pick a team fron as did Fetzer. But

ed about fifteen pounds per man, Fetzer

MeKinnon kicked off and the ball

then started down the tield with a whirl-
wind rush. and it) seemed as theagh
nothing could stop them from making a
touchdown. “Vhe ball was carried with-
in five feet of goal line, but on the fest
buck the Davidson Line was impregnable.

the Davidson teany showed its real fight
and supertority over Clemson, Previous

time after time made consistent gains,
skirting the “Vigers’ ends, and tearing
through the line. By this brilliant. at
tack they brought the ball trom the 20-
vard dine to Clemson's 4 vard — line.
With a touchtown jn sight, the ball was’
lost on fourth down. Clemson kicked
out and the ball was returned to the 20
vard line. McKinnon booted a beautiful
place kick from’a difficult, angle, and
missed anly by two feet. Clemson kick-
ed again. Keesler returned for a long
gain to near the goal line, and when the
whistle blew Davidson could have scored
with a few more seconds to play. In
this quarter, Clemson came near making
a touchdown on a forward pass, but
with an open field before him, the ‘Tiger
end fumbled. Austin received several
forward passes for Davidson in fine
stvle, one time for a gain of fifteen vards.
‘The pass was used to great advantage

misced all their chances. ,
