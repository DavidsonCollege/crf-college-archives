Washington— Tempers have
flared in recent months over
healthcare reform in the United
States. President Obama has pro-
posed a government-provided
healthcare system which has all
political parties up in arms. In the
chaos one group has sadly been
overlooked by many politicians:
the undead.

Many of America’s creatures
that go bump in the night have
had trouble finding affordable
health insurance. Count Wilbur
Von Drobstein, a resident of Penn-
sylvania and a vampire, has gone
through a nightmare trying to find

Frankenstein’s monster:
will MediCare turn him away?

coverage. “I have been to every
major health insurance company
in the United States and none of
them will cover me.” A spokes-
man from Blue Cross Blue Shield
said that it is technically impos-
sible to cover Von Drobstein since
he is not living. “It’s a pre-exist-
ing condition that we will never
ever cover.”

“They all told me that. What
is Obama doing about this? 1
thought things were supposed to
change. YES WE CAN!” Von
Drobstein shouted before turning
into a bat and flying away.

In Obama’s new healthcare
plan nothing is mentioned about
coverage for the undead. Only
living citizens will be guaranteed

coverage. “It makes me think he
doesn’t really want to change
anything, just let the fat cats keep
getting there paycheck,” said a
melancholy zombie. “I know I am
high risk client, I am made from
rotting flesh. But in this day and
age, if I can’t afford a trip to the
morgue for a new human limb
there is something seriously wrong
with our society.”

Vampires, Zombies, Wraiths,
Ghouls, Mummies, and Spectres
are amongst the highest numbers
of uninsured citizens in the United
States. Vermont Senator Thomas
Rinaldi said “It really is a shame
no one has said anything about this
group. Sad really.”

Davidson College Displays
Selfish Acts of Lawn Care

Recent data published by Da-
vidson College officials indicates
that the college plans to spend
$115,190 on lawn maintenance this
year while some third world coun-
tries do not even have water parks.

Many students were outraged
by the implications of this spend-
ing agenda. “Essentially what they
are saying is that our yard work
is more important than these third
world countries having water
parks,” said Amy Chestnut °12. “I
am pretty sure that no one here is
ok with that.”

Chestnut has already made
plans to draw attention to this
problem. Next Thursday she has
called for the school to boycott
looking at the lawns in hopes to
raise overall community aware-
ness. The protesters will distribute
commemorative blindfolds and
seeing-eye dogs to the first one

hundred participants. “This is
something we have needed to do
for a long time now,” said Chest-
nut. “Hopefully by the end of this
the school will realize how trivial a
well-mowed lawn is when so many
countries are still without basic.
water parks.”

In addition to the boycott,
Chestnut recently unveiled her new
agenda for this dream of recre-
ational facilities a reality. The plan,
designed by Chestnut herself, will
involve a $6.4 billion dollar col-
lapsible water park that will tour
third world countries each summer.
“It is basically a mix between a
traveling circus and a huge, normal
water park,” said Chestnut. “And,
like all our assistance to third
world countries, simplicity guaran-
tees its success. All they have to do
is add water.”

Wardrobe

Tf It Matters.

Uncertainty | Get a Bigger

Rampant

A recent Psychology survey has
linked childhood trauma to a dis-
order that prevents differentiation
between tights and pants, between
shirts and dresses, and between
skirts and belts.

A recent study conducted on
NYU’s campus concluded that to-
day’s college students simply aren’t
prepared to dress themselves. Many
experts agree that the blame for
“wardrobe mismanagement” should
be placed on the parents or guard-
ians of adolescents.

“We’ve found a lot of evidence
that points to parental neglect in
this simplest of areas: appropriate
attire,” commented Dr. Peter Den-
zel, who led the study. “The desire
to tell the girl with the fringe bangs
that her tights were in fact, tights
and not pants, was nearly uncon-
trollable.”

A glance around Davidson’s
campus would seem to indicate that
yes, there are students on campus
whose mentors never explained the
difference between underwear and
shorts.

A representative from the
Admissions Office chose to com-
ment, “we can’t turn away students
simply because their parents never
taught them right and wrong, or
the difference between shirts and
dresses. These students just need
more love and attention.”

Administrators seek to equal
the playing field for these under-
privileged students so that they can
feel at home in a pair of boat shoes
and a polo.

The Davidson College Police
Deparment is putting a new spin
on its public outreach this year.
The catchy slogan posted on large
Signs all over campus instructs
students: “If it matters, take it with
you.”

“We’re using this campaign to
weed out dishonest students who
were perhaps unworthy of their
admission here,” explained Honor
Council president Joey Jonas.
“We’re hoping it will tempt them
into theft and robbery, and rest as-
sured, we will catch them.”

The movement has resulted
in mass hysteria on campus as
students rush to protect their most
treasured belongings. Many a
wary student has been spotted
towing a large wagon or army-
sized knapsack to class, which
usually holds his or her computer,
television, most of his clothes, and
his stereo system.

“T tried to bring my Vespa into
Chambers, just to keep an eye on
it,” said freshman Roger Stou-
demire. “I was just gonna park
it in the hall, you know? But my
professor wasn’t really OK with
that.”

Many other Davidson residents
have observed students walking
to class with another person slung
over his or her shoulder.

“He’s my boyfriend,” ex-
plained one women’s basketball
player matter-of-factly, of the
large football player draped across
her back. “He matters. ?'m taking
him with me.”

Discover Davidson Adds Fun

Saturday kicks off the Col-
lege’s annual “Discover David-
son,” a program designed to help
high school seniors decide if Da-
vidson is right for them.

The Admissions Office admits
that tour guide enthusiasm has
plummeted in recent weeks. They
are hoping for Discover Davidson
to boost morale among those sick
of walking backwards and repeat-
ing the same old Library statistics.

“We’ve added a terrific attrac-
tion to the tours for this weekend!
Everyone will get to climb to the
roof of Little Library and pelt pass-
ing professors with water balloons
to show families that Davidson
students know how to have fun!”
explained Senior Admissions Fel-

low Sarah Prier.

The good times will not be
limited to tours. Watts hall coun-
selor Mary Wright exclaimed,
“Our girls are so excited for the
prospectives to sleep over! They’re
already planning on covering the
hallway in shaving cream and
chocolate sauce to create a slip-n-
slide. RLO won’t know what hit
them!”

An inside source also admits
that a plan is to keep faculty from
droning on at lectures is being
implemented.

“As soon as the first person
starts nodding off, we’re going to
lob grenades at the speaker and
blast “Don’t Stop Believin”” on
the PA system.”
