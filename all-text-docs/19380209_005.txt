housemen—Luckies have over
twice as many exclusive smok-
ers as have all the other
cigarettes combined.

HAVE YOU HEARD “THE CHANT OF THE
TOBACCO AUCTIONEER” ON THE RADIO?
When you do, remember that Luckies use the
finest tobacco. And also that the ‘Toasting’
process removes certain harsh irritants found in
all tobacco. So Luckies are kind to your throat.
