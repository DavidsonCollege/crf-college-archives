Rare Law-Abiding Driver Slows

DAVIDSON'S NEWS FOLLOWER

April 9, 2008

Mehmet Civi

or Yellow

Light, Nearly Causes Pile-Up

On Monday afternoon, the inter-
section of East Catawba Avenue
and North Main Street in Cornelius
played host to a stunning execution
of safe, law-abiding defensive
driving.

The prudent and law-abiding driv-
ing of Geo owner Kristin Woods
startled other vehicles and nearly
caused a pile-up Monday evening.

North Meck High sophomore
Kristin Woods was heading north-
bound on Highway 115 just before
5 p.m. when she noticed the flash-
ing yellow lights at the T-intersec-
tion in the distance.

A February graduate of the

Comelius Driving School, Woods
knew exactly what to do:

“I was driving my little brother,
Timothy, to Soccer practice, so I
needed to be as safe as possible,”
the 16-year-old said. “As we
approached the intersection, I sim-
ply kept my foot on the brake
pedal, without pressing down.”

Because she removed her right
foot from the accelerator, Woods’
1997 Geo Metro naturally slowed
to a necessary and precautionary
20 mph.

Additionally, having her foot
calmly poised above the brake
allowed Woods to be prepared to
stop had she encountered unex-
pected traffic in the intersection.

“The slower speed surely gave
her time to scan the entire intersec-
tion,” commented onlooker Wes
Brown. “Maybe a little too much
time. I’m just glad no one was seri-
ously injured by this random law-
fulness.”

Mystery Student Pays with Cash in Union;
Incurs Wrath of All of Davidson

At 6:13 last Thursday, the Union
Café was rocked by what Tom
Ross is calling “a deplorable
action.” Michael Appleby 08 was
waiting in line when the unthink-
able occurred.

“All of a sudden the line came to
a grinding halt. I heard, for the
first time in years, the sound of a
cash register drawer opening and
the jingle of coins. I couldn’t see
who it was but I was sure it was a
Townie or the parent of a prospec-
tive student. I can’t believe it was
one of our own, I feel so betrayed.”

Union Café employee Andrew
Duncombe was at the register dur-
ing the transaction. “I haven’t had

to count out change since Parents’
Weekend. It was awful-all that
filthy money changing hands-I like
it when we stick to the plastic.”
Bystander Jessie Brock ’11 got a
good glimpse of the offender:

“T’ve seen him leaving his 10:30
class, I think he lives in Cannon. I
just don’t know why he would use
real money during Meal Plan
hours.”

Anyone with information is
urged to contact Campus Police to
aid in their investigation.

The suspect is believed to be car-
rying an abundance of loose
change. He is to be considered
armed and dangerous.

Junior Girl Reboots the Old

Ovarian Operating System

When Duke dormitory resident
Ashley Carmichael woke up
Tuesday morning, she trudged
slowly, hesitantly, to the bathroom.
Five minutes later, she bolted out
the door and skipped back down
the hallway to her room.

What happened during those
five, short minutes that could have
produced such a dramatic, magical
turnaround?

“It’s Game Day for the Crimson
Tide!” exclaimed Carmichael, a
junior History major from

Greenville, N.C.

Carmichael had been growing .

increasingly nervous over the past
few days because she had yet to
begin trolling for vampires, nor-
mally scheduled for the first full
weekend of every month.

She and her boyfriend, senior
Trevor Thornton, last hopped on
the good foot and did the bad thing
on Friday, April 4, and despite the
weather, he did not wear a raincoat.

“Trev and I almost always sleave
it to the beaver, but for some rea-
son, that night, we...just...didn’t.
I was just sure that I was flipping
the bird at the Chinese govern-
ment!”

No need to worry, Ashley, Miss
Scarlett’s finally come home to
Tara.

THE DAVIDSONIAN | 9

‘Bex. The Davidsonian

Appears on

Montel Williams

When Stephen Curry waltzed
onto the stage of Conan O’Brien’s
New York set, he expected some
good-natured laughs, gentle pac-
ing, and relatively good ratings.

Turkish delgiht: Mehmet Civi daz-
zled 2.3 million viewers last night.

What Conan and Steph failed to
figure into their plans was Turkish
point guard Mehmet Can Civi’s
simultaneous appearance on
Montel Williams.

Civi, a 6-1 guard from Istanbul,
Turkey, delighted the crowd with
this sharp wit, savvy political com-
mentary and break-dancing skills.

Cystic Fibrosis 5K-
Fun Run Canceled
for Rainstorm; Cystic
Fibrosis Forges On

A mid-morning drizzle and omi-
nous forecast was enough for
Conner House to cancel their annu-
al 5K-Fun Run for Cystic Fibrosis.

The decision was a totally logi-
cal one, claimed Conner Service
Chair Tiffany Puddles, since dis-
eases often die down during bad
weather.

The decision to cancel this 5K
made total sense, because cystic
fibrosis often takes time-outs dur-
ing inclement weather.

Much to everyone’s shock, how-
ever, patients afflicted by Cystic
Fibrosis throughout the greater
Charlotte area continued to be rav-
aged by their fluid-filled lungs ail
mucky afternoon long.

“If we’d known the disease was
this stubborn, we would have
picked something a little more
relenting, like AIDS or SARS.”

The 5K has been rescheduled for
next fall, by which time most
patients who would have benefitted
from the proceeds will be beyond
saving.

A 2007 poll conducted by
Instanbul magazine Fanatyk

Gazetesi ranked Civi as the third
most popular Turk of all time
behind Hidayet Turkoglu of the
Orlando Magic and first president
Mustafa Kemal Atatiirk.

Civi looked dashingly cosmo-
politan in his linen Velour suit and
Gucci loafers. He fielded Montel’s .
complex questions about multilat- .
eralism, the demorcatic primaries,
and the Lula Bell Laundry Service
with disarming insouciance.

He also took the opportunity to
dispel the rumors that he has 40
wives (he has seven), that he is the
descendant of Sultan Mehmet II
(sadly false), and that he had a ‘full
beard by the age of eight (his facial
hair still stalls out after a week).
