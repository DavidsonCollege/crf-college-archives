DISPUTES...

Gambrell, they used the “T” with a
man in motion. But this proved of
little avail, for when the dval final-
ly settled on the field, the Betas
had 6 points and 3 first downs,
and the SAEs had no points and
no first downs.

On Wednesday, the Campus
Club again rolled to victory, this
time against the hapless SPEs. The
Club scored their lone tally on a
sleeper pass from Sam Robinson
to Langford. During the course
of the struggle they also piled up
three first downs against two for
their opponents. The play of the
Club’s line was brilliant. ‘They
continually broke up SPE's offen-
sive plays and set up their
offensive plays. So far, that line
appears to be the best in the Fra-
ternity League. Starring for the
Campus Club were Herb Meza,
Whitner, and Fanjoy, all on the
line. Outstanding for the SPEs was
Ed Hopper, who

Meanwhile the Phi Delts and
the Kappa Sigs were locked in
another controversial struggle.
Early in the game Broéwnson_ of
the Phi -Delts, faded back and

heaved one toward Whit Cobb in
the corner end zone. Cobb leaped
into the air, and caught the ball
in fair territory, but landed out of
bounds. Immediately a dispute
arose over whether or not to al-
low the touchdown. Referee Tim
Hardin proclaimed it geod, and the
Kappa at once placed the
game under protest. The order of
the day was pass combinations.
Vor the Phi Delts it was Brown-
son to Cobb; for the Kappas Sigs
it was Pearson to Wilcox. Both

If it accomplished no other end,
N. C. State's 40-0 walloping of Da-

leigh made better Presbyterians of
the Wildcats. What else but predes-
tination could explain such a lick-

test for which they had been point-

studying up on Psychology, which
is his major, Hal lovingly ‘strokes a
beautiful pair of hand knit argyle
socks and contemplates matrimony
very seriously. She is a lab assis-
tant at W. C, in Greensboro and
Pino says Hal keeps the road be-
tween here and Greensboro pretty
warm. But Hal claims he has got
to get some brains in the family so
he thinks he will marry them in.

With one more year of eligibility
left Hal will be counted for a lot
of service and he is just the guy
who can do it because he’s all ball-
player and a yard wide, which

by serious injuries. |

first in a string of Davidson wins

have the team and the spirit to do
it. What more do we need?
