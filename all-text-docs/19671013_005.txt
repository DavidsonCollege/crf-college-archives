IMAC Nickerball moved in-
to another week with two
games, both involving the Pl
Kapps, being challenged on
account of the officiating.

Charges of poor officiating
were lodged against the Sig-
me Nu’s during the SAE vs.
Pi Kapp game and against
other referees in the Pi Kapp
vs. Phi Gam game.

The E‘s overwhelmed the
Pi Kapps, 33-12, while the
Gams edged them 20-19. Most
of the Pi Kapps’ points were
scored in the final minutes
of play.

Meanwhile, the ATO’s roar-
ed over the Betas and Phi
Gams but fell to the Kappa
Sigs. Tau Vance Hughes pull-
ed the game against the
Gams out of the fire by scor-
ing in the final 25 seconds of
play. Adding insult to injury.
the Taus intercepted a Fiji
pass to thwart the Gams’
final scoring attempt.

The Taus then swamped the
Betas 46-0 in a romp in which
only six Betas participated.
Everyone got into the act for
the Taus as they proved to
be a formidable threat for
the IMAC flickerball crown
this season.

The KA’‘s pulled a pair out
in overtime this week, one
over the Sigma Chi’s and the
other over the Betas. The
Sigma Chi’s battled the win-

The Betas fought the KA's

felt again, this time to the
E’s. The final score was 20-
13, as Ed Embree provided
subtle know-how for the E
win.

While traditional powers
tumbled, a traditional loser,
the Sig Eps, roared on to
their second win of the sea-
son. The Sig Eps, fresh from

a win over the Nu's, romped
over the Pikas, 32-6. Stand-
outs for the SPE's included
Bob McKellar and Dan
Gresham, while Robert Pye-
att added moral support.

The Phi Gams added an.
other win to their season total
when they polished off the
KA‘s, 18-13, in a hard-fought
contest.

Meanwhile, the Pi Kapps
annihilated the tndependents,
42:12. Jimmy Robertson
sparked the Pi Kapp offense
with 27 points to his credit
and several timely catches.
Larry Jones, Yates Fletcher
and Ben Martin also shined
on offense, while Tom Graves
pileted the defense for the
victors.

Rebounding from their loss
to the KA's, the Sigma Chi's
blitzed the Pikas, 41-6. Bruce
Weihe starred for the Machis
on offense, while sophomore
Jim Long anchored the stin-
gy Machi defense. Tom Kast-
ner and Bob Pickens starred
for the Pikas. .

The Pikas met with some
more bad luck this week, as
they dropped another game,
this time to the ‘Phi Gams.
The Fijis rolled over for 26
points, while the losers were
able to score only six points.

Bog Apgar ignited the Gam

attack with two touchdowns
to his credit. The Pikas failed
to score until the last 10 sec-
onds of the game.

The Fijis also proved their
prowess against the KA'S. as
the Gam machine rolled to
an 18-13 win. Doug Rhymes
and Dave King starred for
the winners.

Fogleman Names Eleven
To Varsity Tennis Team

Eleven players have been
named to Davidson's South-
ern Conference champion
tennis team, Coagh Harry
Fogleman announced this
week.

They are George Bruner
of Helsinki, Finland; James
Cantrell of Tampa. Fila.:
Harlan Day of Lake Worth,
Fla.; Woody Faulk of New
Orleans, La.; Sam Hatcher
of Columbus, Ga.; Dan Hea-
ron of Daytona Beach, Fla.:

Steve Hemphill of Hickory,

Greenville, S. C.; Robert
Johnson of Portsmouth,
Ohio; Randy Jones of Greens-
boro, N. C.; and Bruce Weid-
ner of Oxford, Ohio.

Cantrell, Day and Hemp-

hill are freshmen. Rob John-

son was named manager.
The squad will elect a cap-
tain later this fall, Fogleman
said. The selections were
based on performance dur-

ing fall practice and a recent
intrasquad tournament.

The 1968 varsity schedule
consists of about 25 matches.
Fogleman said, including a
spring tour of Florida and the
Southern Conference tourna-
ment at Virginia Military In-
stitute in Lexington, Va.

Davidson has retained the
conference title four consec-
utive years.

fifth in passing in small col-
lege statistics, having com-
pleted 48 of 78 passes for a
total of 574 yards.

Poole is second in the con-
ference in total offense.

Top receivers in the South.
ern Conference are Jim Cav-
anaugh of William and Mary
and Walker Gillette of Rich-
mond. Cavanaugh has caught
32 passes this year and Gil-
lette has hauled down 25. Col-
son of East Carolina paced
the conference backs in rush-
ing.

With an impressive set of
statistics under his belt,
Poole is given a good chance
by many observers of repeat-
ing his honors received last
year.~“I said it before the
game and I'll say it again,”
Richmond Coach Frank Jones
said, “Jimmy Poole is the
conference's best quarter-
back. He's amazing the way
he can hit that quick, short
pass no matter how many
men are around the receiv
er.”

Poole is in good position to
remain king on the confer-
ence passing hill, since Fur-
man's Hewell, who was his
closest competitor, was in-
jured last week. Hewell re-
ceived a shoulder injury in
a game with Wofford.

‘Cat Booters Rolling
To Impressive Year

By DON SEWELL
Assistant Sports Editor

Davidson's Wildcat
soccer team has been roll-
ing over everything in
sight in compiling its 30
record going into today’s
game with St. Andrews.
Registering wins over Er-
skine College. Methodist
College and North Caro-
lina Wesleyan College.
the ’Cats have outscored
opposition by 20 goals to
three.

Following up on their 6-1
shellacking of Erskine, fhe
hooters drubbed Methodist
College on the Wildcat field
by a 7-1. score.

Alfonso Carrillo, a Rich
ardson Scholar from Ecua
dor, and sophomore Bill Hor
ton kicked three goals apiece
to lead the attack.

Wing Sam Darby added
the other Wildcat score as
goalie Harry Hamil made the
losers settle for a single goal.

Carrying their two wins ta
tthe North Carolina Wesleyan.
the Wildcats embarrassed
their hosts by crushing them
7-1. This time Carrillo boot-
ed four goals, while Jim Mar-
row and Charlie Cameron
each added a goal from their
wing positions. Randy Car-
ter scored once from his in-
side spot.

The ‘Cats got off to a slow
start in both these games, al-
lowing the opposition to jump
into a 1-0 lead. But after the
opening goals, Davidson con-
trolled the games. At North
Carolina Wesleyan the ‘Cats
dominated the second half
while playing in a soaking
rain. Even in the muddy con-
ditions, Hamil played his
best game at goalie, Coach
Harry Fogleman said.

This Wildcat soccer team
has the potential to be one of
Davidson's finest ever, Fo-

BILL HORTON PASSES
Early season holds promise.

gleman added, It has scored
20 goals in three games as
compared with 22 goals for
the entire ten game schedule
for last year’s team.

Strong personnel has been
the key to the team’s suc-
cess and is the secret of its
strength. Fogleman - said.
Carillo dazzles opponents ev-
ery game with his daring
dribbling, pin-point passing
and scoring ability, he add.
ed, Playing the center for-
ward position, he is effec.
tive at passing to either side
or making the shot himself.

Dave Dilley and Bill Hor-
ton provide support at: their
inside positions. Roger Peter-
son and Randy Carter are
two newcomers who have
improved so much that Fo-
gleman said he finds it hard
to keep them out of the start-

ing lineup. Peterson has been
playing at the wing and is
almost certain to nail down
a starting spot soon, Fogle-
man added.

With no fewer than six
halfbacks in the lineup, Fo-
gleman can use two three-
man platoons without fear of
sacrificing strength. ‘‘The
biggest problem 1 have had
in coaching this team so far.”
Fogleman quipped, ‘‘has been
deciding who to start. And
that is the problem I have
looked forward to for a long
time.”

Other players who Fogle-
man said have been doing a
fine job are freshman full-
backs Dick Allison and Cliff
Patterson. Patterson, a cen-
ter halfback, was cited for
his performance on both of-
fense and defense.

Wrestling

Monday

Coach Charles Parker an
nounced this week that wres
Uing practice will begin at

ence rule whic-h permits

Davidson's grapplers will

conference last season.

ANSWER
MAN

ROBERT T. STONE

Is it true all life insurance costs
pretty much the same?

Definitely not! There is a wide
variation in the net cost of life
insurance among companies.

I'd like to take this opportunity to familiarize you
with the term “net cost” as defined by a leading

insurance journal.

Flitcraft Courant indicates that net cost should be
arrived at by first adding up all dividends received.
To them, add the cash value of the policy at a given
time. And from that total, subtract the sum of all

premiums paid.

The difference is the net cost of life insurance.
This is the basis the Courant uses for its ‘‘Ten-

Year Cost Study,”

which shows Northwestern

Mutual Life as a national leader in low net cost
among major life insurance companies.
