In an election held last week, the

Phi Society
Meets Again

On Monday, October 28, the Phi-
lanthropic Literary Society held its
regular bi-monthly meeting.

The business meeting was rather
prolonged, owing to a discussion of
Ralph Klontz’s plan for the socicty’s
leading an effort “to promote -log-
ical thinking on the campus.” It
was brought out that the term
“logical thinking” was much too
broad to be practical, and also that
such a program as had been sug-
gested might fall more properly
under the care of-such organiza-
tions as the International Relations
Club... The-proponents-of-the-plan
limited it as “logical thinking with
special reference to national and
international affairs.” They fur-
ther showed that the whole idea
involved only co-operation on the
part of Phi Society with other in-
terested groups on the campus.
Klontz said that with the help of
the others it would be possible to
bring well-informed speakers to
the campus.

Some who opposed an all out
effort on the part of the Society
along ‘the lines propounded pointed
out that there were current events
and topics right here in Davidson
that were important to all of. us
and should not be neglected, much
less'than excluded from considera-
tion, a point which was granted by
the others. The discussion drew
to a close with the appointing of
a committee consisting of Leigh-
ton McKeithan (chairman), Lamar
Williamson, and Ralph Klontz, to
\correlate the society’s activity with
that of the other groups.
