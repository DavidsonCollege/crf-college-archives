Business
magnate, yacht
enthusiast and
generally

acclaimed capitalistic pig Donald Trump has completely taken over

Davidson College. Reactions across the board have been quite mixed.
The trustees seem to be relatively happy with the situation. Board president Craig Wall
stated, “He’s financially stable. I like that.”

Wall’s only fears concerned
Trump’snew slogan for marketing
campus condom machines: “The
New Titanium-Tipped Trump
Tickler, tougher than leather but
smooth as silk,” and the slogan to
be printed on the condoms
themselves: “I like thinking big. If
you’re going to be thinking
anyway, you might as well think
big.” Bui Wall was sure this glitch
could be worked out.

On campus reaction was more
varied. For a complete and total
appraisal of what the students really
think, The David's Onion went to
the only source that counts,
Patterson Court.

The PiKAs invited Trump to
“come party with the Lads,” but
when he came to the late night it
was so crowded thatno one noticed
his presence and an extremely
intoxicated Lad laid a technicolor

yawn down Ivana’s cleavage.

Phi Delts displayed more
anxiety upon hearing of Trump’s
actions. Quoth one especially large
person, “He’s too rich and looks
like a KA.” However, a
compromise was reached when
Trump agreed to ensure the rightto
whiffle ball on the Smith House

lawn for Davidson generations to

come.

Anentourage of cheering, well
dressed SAEs welcomed Trump at
the airport waving banners and
résumés. The entire assembly then
proceeded back to the Hod house
for a mixer with the Clemson Tri
Delts; Ivana wasn’t invited. (She
was left at the Kappa Sig house for
safe keeping.) Trump had such a
good time that he purchased a tie-
dyed “Trump Beemer” to transport
select Hods to the latest Dead Show.
(It came tie-dyed—God knows
they didn’t do it themselves).

The Sig Eps gave Trump a
bid. When he refused, they said
that he could still play Assassin
with them if he wanted.

Kappa Sigma called an
immediate house-wide formal
meeting on the subject. Of course,
the meeting had to be transferred
to the library to accommodate the
Squids’ rigorous study habits.

PAX decided to stage a
marathon protest volleyball match
nottoend until Trump, hiscars, his
boat, his values and Ivana got the
heck out of town. Don’ tgetblisters
guys, and watch for ruts when all
the grass gets worn down.

le Slagle dismantle the Habitat for Humanity house they worked
hard to construct earlier this year. “Trump’s the boss,” sighed Hornsby. “He thinks big.”

As usual, no one was at the
BSC for comment.

Now on to KA. “The Order”
seems to share a_ special

camaraderie with Trump and_

spared no expense to greet “The
King.” Upon entering the house,
Trump was issued aritual bandanna
to hang out the back of his
c uckhedds. He wenttoshake hands
with who he thought was the
chapter president, but it turned out
to be just a pledge (never could tell
those guys apart). Everyone then
went out back for the first annual
“Trump Masters Putt-Putt Classic.”
Before aroaring crowd of bovines,
Trump himself came through to
claim the coveted pink oxford by
Ralph Lauren. His prize was
donated to the Sig Ep house.

When informed that Davidson
had a Fiji chapter off campus,
Trump stated, “Really?” _

The independents sat around
at the Union Cafe talking about
moral superiority and writing
comic strips.

In next week’s issue: “Trump
Denies Dean Williams Tenure.”

Trump Trumpet.

NCNB movesto
Davidson in
surprise Trump

deal!

By GEORGE, | THINK HE'S GOT IT!

The banking and the academic community
buzzed Monday after Donald Trump
announced a “friendly” takeover of NCNB.
Trump, who recently purchased Davidson
College, said that the acquisition is part of his
elaborate plan for a ‘‘mega-super-regional

bank and school.”’

The Charlotte-based bank will be renamed Trump
National and will move its headquarters to Davidson.
Trump was vague over the exact amount offered for the
takeover, but he hinted that the sum was lower than he had
expected. “I love the bargain,”
Trump said, “I love quality, but

I don’t believe in paying top
price for quality.”
