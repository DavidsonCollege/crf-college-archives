Little Symphony
Presents Concert

Thor Johnson Directs Third
Davidson Concert Series
The University of Michigan Little

Symphony, under the direction of Thor
Johnson, presented the third concert of
the Davidson College series Friday: eve-
ning, April 12, in Chambers Auditorium.

Soloists with the group were Miss
Ruth Pfohl, concert harpist and head
of the harp department in the School
of Music, and Romine Hamilton, violinist
and instructor in string instruments.
John Krell, flutest; Charles Gilbert, obo-
ist, and Bernard Hirsh, clarinetist, were
incidental soloists.

The Little Symphony opened the pro-
gram with the overture to the opera,
“Mignon,” by Thomas, and followed by
the “Trio Des Jeunes Ismaelites de l’En-
fance du Christ,” by Berloiz. Romine
Hamilton then exhibited his technical en-
dowment in the brilliant Concerto No. 4
in ID major, Mozart. The group prob-
ably gave its most finished performance
in the playing of the “Flight of the Bum-
blebee,” a vividly descriptive number.
Other numbers occupying prominent po-
sitions on the program were ‘“Intermez-
zo," by Bizet; “La Fille Aux Cheveux
de Linj’ Debussy, and the overture to
the opera “Die Fledermaus,” by Strauss.

The work of Thor Johnson, conductor
of the orchestra, is familiar to the resi-
dents of this state because of his out-
standing work as director of the Caro-
lina Ensemble. Mr. Johnson is now as-
sistant instructor in the Department of
Music of the University of Michigan.

After the concert, the symphony was
entertained at a reception given by Mrs.
Pfohl and Mrs. Vowles.

Ghastly Negro Murder Takes
Place In Davidson Saturday

Stark tragedy greeted Davidson stu-
dents and their girls returning from the
Bowery Ball in the early hours of last
Sunday morning in the form of the
bleeding body of John Stevens, a middle-
aged negro man, lying near the railroad
station covered only by a bloody sheet.

When the crowd of dancers reached
the campus and learned of the murder,
Stevens had been dead, for two hours,
but his body, guarded by a policeman
and a frightened group of negroes hud-
dled about a small fire, remained where
it had fallen, pierced by five bullets.

The man who filled Stevens’ back and
head with lead is said to be another
negro, Charles Ruth, who, despite the
intensive search of authorities, and to
the great uneasiness of the negro set-
tlement, is still at large.

Ruth was formerly in the employ of
the college. He has always had a repu-
tation among the negroes of the com-

munity for being a dangerous man to

deal with when crossed. The officers in
charge of investigating the crime have
not officially established a motive for
the slaying, but the rumor is current
Ruth and Stevens.

It all began several months ago’ when

Ruth insulted a girl companion of Ste-
vens’, the insults demanding a fight which
saw Ruth con§iderably worsted, and both
negroes sent to jail for short terms. Dur-
ing his imprisonment, it would seem,
Ruth nursed his grudge until it grew to
murderous intensity.

He encountered Stevens Saturday
night in the street at the railroad sta-
tion. Accounts of the shooting are none
too clear, but it seems that both men
had been drinking, and that Ruth drew
his pistol, fired twice into Stevens’ back
and head, saw him drop dead on the
ground, and then put two more shots
into the corpse. (According to a janitor
who insists he knows, the shooting was
scheduled for Thursday night, but there
was a hitch somewhere, and it had to
be postponed.)

By the time some students who were in
the Little Pep at the time reached the
scene, Ruth had made good his escape
down the railroad tracks. The impro-
vised morgue afforded by the street light
and the sheet attracted a number of boys,
and a few girls, some of whom looked
at the gory head, its features set hor-
ribly in a grin.

REGISTRATION BEGINS

All students now in Davidson who
are expecting to continue their
studies here next year will register
for the courses which they wish to
take next year. This registration
will start April 16, continuing
through the 20th. The advance reg-
istration is necessary to give an idea
of what courses are desired and also
to insure a _ student's obtaining
courses which are necessary to him.
Those who do not register during
the required time ‘are merely plac-
ing obstacles in the way of obtaining
desired courses. The new student
registration for next year is increas-
ing rapidly, and at present, equals
the number of student who had reg-
istered at this time last year.

The final examinations will begin
on the 21st or the 22nd of May and
will continue through Friday, May
Ist. The schedule will be pub-
lished in the May 1st issue of The
Davidsonian.

ATTENDANCE IS_ LARGE

“Captured By Christ’? Is Minis-
ter’s Topic For Tonight

Bringing to a close the annual Spring
Services, marked this year by a note
of practicality and sincerity in religion,
Rev. John A. Redhead will speak to-
night “Captured by Christ,” at 7
o'clock Chambers Building.

on
in

“Life in Four Dimensions” was Red-
head's opening topic Sunday morning.
“Length measured by years and
breadth is measured by the broadness
of one’s interest in things and people,”
said Rev. Redhead. Depth of conviction
and feeling, and height of aspiration
and ideals completed the four dimensions
of life presented by the young preacher.

“What a man gets out of life depends
upon what he brings to life and upon
his capacity for living. This capacity
may be measured in the four above di-
mensions. The life of Christ, although
only 33 years in length, was perfect and
complete in all three of the other di-
mensions.”

Speaking to a large vespers’ audience,
Redhead spoke on “The Power of Sin.”
“Our sins are mightier than we are, first
in the power to fasten on us the sense
of guilt and remorse which we cannot
shake off. Second, our sins are mighty
in their power to become habitual, and
third, in the power to bring their con-
sequences to bear upon other lives than

1s

our own.”

“But although our sins are mightier

than we are, our gospel is ‘that we have
a Savior who is greater than they,” was
the concluding theme of the second ser-
mon. ‘
“How to Make Religion Real,” a mes-
sage of excellent frankness and. practi-
cality, was given before the student body
assembled at chapel period Monday.
“One's clothes, one’s manner of wearing
the hair, or even one’s manners are no
longer indications of one’s character or
morality,” began the speaker.

“But the road to life has not only a
beginning but an end,” pointed out Red-
head, “and the test of a moral or im-
moral act is what the result will be. And
a‘supreme test for something that.is good
or bad, ethical unethical, is ‘What
would Christ do in this circumstance?’
The life of Jesus is the one perfect
which me may mold our-

or

model upon
selves.” )

“How to Make Religion Real’ was
the keynote of the talk Monday night.
“It may be made real to other people
by giving it a flesh and blood setting in
our own lives,” began the popular young
minister, ‘That is the method God used :
The Word was made flesh and dwelt
among us.” He pointed out that incar-
nations to be persuasive should be at-
tractive.

Redhead pointed out that Jesus was
master ‘of the fine art of making good-
attractive—He full of grace
and truth. “Our incarnation of, religion
should warned Redhead.
“Practice should conform to confession.”

Davidson’s annual Bowery Ball, one
of the most delightful social events of
the college year, was held Saturday night
in the Charlotte Armory-Auditorium,
and proved to be an unusually success-
ful and brilliant affair. Two other dances
served as preliminaries to the ball and
these were held in the Charlotte Hotel
ballroom.

Judding spring, though
Saturday night, brought
its most enjoyable times
comely girls* who made the situation per-
fect. The music, furnished by Jimmy
Poyner and his orchestra, allowed the
high spirits of none to decline until
everything had come to a satisfactory
close. The entertainments were spon-
sored by the Pan-Hellenic Council.

The opening entertainment of the se-
ries was Friday night, lasting from 9
until 2, at the Hotel. Charlotte. Follow-
ing this was the free tea dance Satur-
day afternoon at the Armory with the
Bowery Ball afterwards.

The auditorium was gaily decorated
with black and red streamers and a re-
flecting mirror ball in the middle hang-

streamers were furnished to the delight
of all.

“A very impromptu figure led by Ged-
die Monroe and Louisa Rankin was im-
mensely entertaining. Mr. Monroe wore
the costume of an old lady with a huge
straw hat offsetting this. Miss Rankin
wore a flossy red blouse and a black
skirt, while her shoes and hosiery fitted
her ensemble perfectly. After the fig-
ure was over, the costume prize was
awarded to Miss Mary Harris and Mr.
Wilbur Edwards. Miss Harris wofe a
Russian ensemble consisting of a small
hat of white bordered with red, a cape
and dress of white satin and a pair of
boots also of red and white. Mr. Ed-
wards wore a rakish suit of gray with
peg leg trousers, a stiff collared shirt,
bowery tie, and a big derby accentuated
by a walking cane. Along with the idea
of the event Jimmy Poyner and his or-
chestra were dressed in costumes and
played quite a few novelty numbers.

casion included :
