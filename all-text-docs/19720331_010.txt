Davidson Groups To Sponsor

Voter Registration Drive Here

By RICHARD ROMEYN
Staff Writer

The Dav:dson Peace Coalition
and the Admimstration's Office
of Personnel and Administrative
Services will jointiy sponsor a
program to encourage the col-
lege’'s employees to register to
vote.

Director of Personnel Robert
Stephenson does not feel it is
gut of place or unusual for the
callege to become involved in
vo.er registration. “After all.
the college 1s naturally inter-
ested in encouraging its em-
plovees to vote,” he said.

Peace Coalition member Steve
Cross plans to meet with groups
of college employees on Mcn-
day and Thursday of next week.
Both the college and ARA
Siater will give their employees
time off to attend.

Cards Contain StudentSouls

By BRUCE MALOY
Staff Writer

Every studen: at Davidson
College has his academic soul
committed to an 81 by 11 card
in the Registrar's Office.

This card, the permanen: rec-
ord, identifies the college and
the student on cue side. On this
same s.de 1s a description ot
'>o courses taken, the term they
were taken. the final grade, an
«vplanaiion of the grading svys-
tem, the requirements for grad-
uation, and a statement of the
student's eligibility for a degree.

It is this s.de of the perma-
wert record which is copied tv
Make a transcript.

The reverse side contains tes:
duta such as SAT scores and
foreign language placement test
scures. The student's final grade-
point average, hs rank in class.
college-related activities, and .:
listing of the institutions +0
which transcripts have been
sem are also on this side.

No information from this side
of the permanent record is ever
put op a transcript unless the
Student specifically requests it
on the transeript reques: form.

The transcript which is pic-
tured below is a realistic dum-
my prepared by Registrar Rich-
ard C. Burts Jr. It is on the
same type of form as three.
fourths of the records of stu-
dents now at Davidson.

Members of the Freshman
class have their records on a
revised form. The form below
has certain discrepancies due
to academic changes. For ex-
ample, grade points are now
used in place of quality points.
The grades of A plus and D
plus have been dropped.

The change from Area Exams
to Extended Studies moved the
number of courses needed for
graduation from thirty-two to
thirty-six. (The 2.00’s which ap-
pear for Pass/-Fail courses are

not included in thé grade point
average:) :

As pointed out by Burts,
“There have been many transi-
tions in.the permanent record.

The change from the semester
to the quarter system as well
us the development of the Hon-
ors College have necessitated
special arrangements.”

When asked who has access
to the permanent record. Burts
stated. ‘Firs: of all. the studer
has access to his oun record as
well as any member of the fac-
ulty or administration with a
leg:timate interest, the student's
parents, and philanthropic or-
fanizations supporting the stu
dent.

“The reeord is released to
others,” Burts continued. ‘only

at the student's request. By and
large. we will do anything we
can which will benef.t the stu-
dent.”

Burts went on to state, ““Spe-
cifie information which is con-
Side.ed tu be a matter of pub-
lie record such as degrees earn-
ed oa d daies of enrollment is
teieased to guvernment agen-
Ces or. individuals without the
student’s permission.”

When asked how much influ-
ence the permanen: record car-
ries. Burts replied. “The tran-
scrip: is a critical item with
graduate schools.”

At the meetings Cross plans
to outline the requirements
which must be met for registra.
tion, and to encourage those
who are not registered to do so
before the April 7 deadlines. It
is possible to register at the
Davidson Town Hall any week
day between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.

Most of the college employees
meet the qualifications for reg.
istration, but neither Stephen
son nor Cross were sure how
many are already registered.

“It may be.” said Stepnenson.
“that nearly all of them are.”

If it becomes apparent that
a sizable block of employees
are not registered. the Election
Board in Charlotte will send
someone out to register them
on campus.

The voter registration drive
is part of the Peace Coalition’s
voter education program. The
coalition will sponsor a full week
of speakers and discussion of
the issues later in April.

Counseling Programs

viser,”’ Terry said.

“We may form teams of fac-
ulty and seniors who can help
the sophomore measure his in-
tellectual growth and find di-
rection for his college career.
Many sophomores may need a
major advisor.” added Terry.

The college chaplain can pro-
vide another essential counsel-
ing role. “What the new chap-
lain will be is up for grabs:
many s udents feel he isn't nec-
essary.” Terry said. “But 1
thnk we reed someone with
whom students can discuss theo-
logical questions which are real-
ly a personal quest.”

Both Hall and Terry acknow-
ledged the problems and _ po-
tential benefits of an effective
counseling program. “Our mosi
serious problem may be the un.
willingness of studemts to take
advantage of counseling. To the
male ego. asking for help is
often a challenge to masculin-

ity.” Terry said.

The faculty memrer holds the
key to helping students, accord-
ing to Terry. ‘‘As long as we
preach interest in the individ.
ual, the most potent counseling
force at Davidson is the facul-
ty member's open door, and
many times it just isn open,”
he added.

“If the college is committed
to real attention to the student,
counseling can be a valuaine
asset,” said Hall. ‘‘The trouble
is the many students who can't
ste me. The encounter group
Situation may be the way to
get these people to recognize
and understand their feelings.

“A major problem at David-
son is the student's passive par-
ticipation in the educational
proces,” concluded Hall. ‘‘Ef-
fective counseling can help stu-
dents find their own value sys-
tem. It can help students to be
creatively involved in Davidson
College and in touch with its
people.”
