Baseball falls short of victory versus UNCC

By Rick Thurmond

Fresh off of a victory at Duke,
the baseball team dropped a hard-
fought loss to UNCC in its first
home game this season. An NCAA
tournament team last year, the
Forty-Niners jumped out to a 4-0
lead off starting pitcher Clay Hall
after four innings.

In the fourth, Drew Fassett
uncorked a long two-run home run
to cut UNCC's lead in half. Mean-
while, reliever Chris Pollard came
on in the fifth for the Wildcats and

held the visitors scoreless for the
next four frames.

The ‘Cats struck again in the
eighth, tying the score with Mac
Chapman's two-run homer to left.
Chapman closed the ninth on the
mound, forcing three straight
ground balls and sending the game
into extra innings tied 4-4.

In the tenth, the 'Cats' errors
seemed tocatch up with them when
miscommunication caused a high
fly ball just out of the infield to

second. The heart of Davidson's
batting order could not make up
the run, and the 'Cats fell 5-4.

Fassett and Hall each had
two hits for the Wildcats.
Chapman gotthe loss, his first, on
the unearned run.

In their season opener, the
Wildcats beat their first ACC team
in two years, rolling to a 10-7
victory over Duke at Durham.

In the fifth, Michael New hit
a line drive that carried over the
fence for a solo homer that was

a hungry Virginia team.

season, the Wildcats started out

the best doubles teams in recent
years, Davidson lost the doubles

Wrestlers win individual victories at ASU

By Neil Marks

The wrestling team lost acon-
vincing decision to a tough Appa-
lachian State team last Wednes-
day. The only individual victories
for Davidson came from freshmen
Aaron Kenner (142) and Miles
Miller (167), who shut out his op-
ponent 10-0. The result was an
improvement over last year’s shut-
out at Davidson.

“We’re showing improve-
ment. We had a handful of very
close matches. Sean Harvey was in
aone point match and then sprained
his ankle so he couldn’t finish,”
said head coach Tom Oddo.

The team also recently com-
petedin an invitational tournament
with The Citadel, Gardner-Webb,
Campbell, Appalachian State, and
Carson-Newman. Witheighttoten
competitors in each bracket,
Davidson had three wrestlers fin-
ish fourth even though three start-
ers stayed at home.

“Tt was a very tough tourna-
ment. The guys start to wrestle
much harder at this point in the
season. On top of that, we’re bat-
tling some injuries along with some
minor skin infections,” said Oddo.

Although the team’s record
stands at 5-12, several individuals
are working on excellent seasons.

Knowles is 19-10 and several other
wrestlers are flirting with .500
records.

The team is looking forward
to the conference tournament on
March 6 in Asheville.

“I think we’1l do a lot better in
the conference tournament than in

the past. We have several guys _ fifth,” said Oddo.

who have a shot at placing high.
We’re slowly crawling out of the

. basement,” said Oddo.

“We need to emphasize that
the conference has only five teams
and each is fielding strong com-
petitors. If we had a ten team con-
ference, we would still be fourth or

Davidson’s only home run of the
day. The scoring was through after
six innings.

Offensive standouts for the
Wildcats included Paul Brannan,
Brett Boretti, and Michael New, each
with two hits apiece.

Boretti and New both added
three RBI’s. Junior Mills Arial got
the victory for five innings of score-
less relief.

The Wildcats’ record dropped
to 1-3 with a double-header loss at
UNC-Wilmington (11-7), (4-3).

5. This clin de the doubles point
as the Cats split the first two matches.
The number one tandem of Russell
Briggs and Ryan Harper lost 8-4,
but the number three team of Bill
Mitchem and Chris Parker easily
disposed of their opponents, 8-3
The -team turned the match
around, however, by seizing control
ofthesingles. Coach Jeff Frank was
pleased by Davidson’s response to
the “pressure situation” of losing
the doubles point and having to win
four of the six singles matches. All
six players met the challenge. Dan
Grinnan, playing his first match since
injuring his knee two weeks ago,
started the onslaught by defeating
Dave Wallace at number five, 6-3,
6-1. Vaughan, Parham, and Harper,
playing at numbers two, four, and
six, respectively, each won their
matches without losing a set to seal
the victory. Because of the early
clinch, the team decided to stop to

Losing pitchers were Chris
Carrigan and Chris Pollard.

Pollard turned in another
strong performance in the second
game. However, unearned runs
led to the loss.

Paul Brannan and Drew
Fassett continued their hot hit-
ting with two-hit games.

The Wildcats have five more
games on the road before they
return home on March 2 to face
Duke in the first of a 13-game
home stretch.

down against Virginia the next
day. Russell Briggs at number
one and Chris Parker at number
three were both ahead in their
matches,

The Virginia Cavaliers came
to Davidson on Saturday with the
intent to avenge last year’s defeat
and to erase the memory of Albie
Varoski’ s jubilant jaunt around
the Senior Apartments and
Patterson Court. The Wahoos
did just that. According to their
coach, UVA played their best ten-
nis of the entire season, and they
whitewashed the Wildcats with-
out dropping a set.Coach Frank
was disappointed that the team
“didn’t play as well as we’re ca-
pable,” but he expects them to
rebound. On Sunday, the team
travels to Chapel Hill, where they
will try to knock off the #18 North
Carolina Tarheels.
