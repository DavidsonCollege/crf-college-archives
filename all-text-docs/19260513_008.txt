THE DAVIDSONIAN, MAY 13, 1926

Pictures of Spain
and Mexico Shown

On last Friday night the Spanish Club
sponsored a series of motion pictures
shown in the gymnasium. There pictures
were of scenes taken in Mexico and
Spanish America, and proved to be of in-
tense interest to those that are now tak-

ing Spanish courses.

The first of these was a motion picture |
of Mexico, taking the outstanding fea- |

tures from Juarez, the northernmost port
of entry, down to Mexico City.

The Juniors lost their first game to the
Sophs because they did not play heads- |
up baseball. The outfielders kept their.

several balls to keep from ketting. hit.
This cost them the game. For the Juniors
Slim Vaughn, the spit-ball artist, pitched
good ball. He had a fast out curve that
dropped so low at times that the batters
lcaught cold in their ankles because the.
breeze was so strong.

Pauline Mauldin, who hurled the Sophs
to. victory, did not even have a prayer,
and that was not answered, but due to
beating fresh and throwing rocks at the

, were not able to do much hitting.

|He handled many hot balls which came
‘to him directly from the batters gun. |

He was almost fired from the game for |
| putting the balls in his pockets. He
| handled the balls well but forgot to throw
ithem to first when he got them. One
person was heard to remark that he
would make a professional juggler look
like a hand-cuffed armless wonder if he
were pitted against him.

Crownem McColgan, the Soph’s only
hope, and captain of their team poled out
a homer in fourth inning. He was in
fine form during the whole day. In fact,
his form made Gloria Swanson look like
a bag of meal. :

Anyone wishing to make good money |

nine can easily become rich by picking
an all-dumb team from this aggregation
and touring the continent with them to
give exhibition games. For further in-

Hudgins, Stiffarm Laws, or Buckshot
Jennings.

For the first time in several years the
University of Illinois is not represented
with a conference championship team.
At this same time last year they were the
holders of five championship teams. Ath-
letic teams are things which are hard to
figure on when it comes to being cham-
pions; it depends a whole lot on the
teams of other institutions.

society was held at their hall last Thurs-
day evening. :

The query for debate was Resolved:
That the morals of the girls of today are
better than those of the girls thirty years
ago. Morrison and Phillips upheld the

Rk. A, Glenn; secretary, H. Worzel; treas- !
urer, R. Dixon; first critic, D. M. Cal-
houn; second critic, F. Phillips; first su-

hoped that the members will make an
effort to be present.

Pandeinic
* The regular meeting of the Pandeinic
Literary Society was held last Tuesday
evening. The meeting was opened with
Current Events by Glenn Eddington. The
regular debate was not held. The other |
two numbers on the program were Cur-
rent Events by C. R. Mc-Carty and an
oration by C, D. Patterson.

An essay contest was announced by the
Forensic Council to be held in the near

many as could enter this contest. After
a short business session the society ad-
