F&M Jumps To Early Lead
In IMAC Volleyball Action

By HOWARD BOYD
Assistant Sports Editor

IMAC-leading F&M has jump-
ed off to a good start in IMAC
volleyball, and looks to be a
strong favorite to add to its
already imposing lead in the
over-all standings.

Paced by the return of Frank
Clark who jumped the team
to play for Porter’s in hasket-
ball) plus the play of veterans
Pete Jorgenson. Cooper Geraty.
Rany Parker and Bill Gusenant.
F&M posted two straight wins
in early action.

Through Wednesday's games
F&M. was in a three-way dead-
lock for the lead in league A.
after polishing off the Taus
15-8. 15-8 and drubbing the hap-
less Bigs.

Also 2-0 in games thus far.
and looming as F&M's sternest
cnallenge in league A is Kee‘er’s
which thumped Bigs 15-11. 15-8
behind Gary Seibal’s spikes and
edged the E’s Wednesday two
games to one.

Emanon 2 is the other co-
leader, and has looked supris-
ingly strong in knocking off
Ernie's Boys, 15-8. 11-15, 15-42
and crushing Sentelle 3 15-3, 15-5.

In league B. the SPEs, playing
without ace spiker Buzz.Taner.
have posted three straight wins
and hold a slim half-game edge
over Sentelle 3A (2-0).

The SPEs belted Pax | 15-5,
15-7, rallied to down Delt | 7-15,
15-12, 15-10, and walloped Liftte
Wl 15-2, 15-7 Wednesday.

Sentelle 3A, which was form-
ed- when Sentelle 4 was divided
into two teams. is paced by
Larry Horowitz. Chris Young.
Greg Dunn. Sheldon Parker and
Reggie Harding. They edged the
Pikas 2-1] and stopped Pax I
2:0 Wednesday.

Pax 2 tops league C, at 2-0.
with Our Boys Gang in second
at 1-0. In third place at 2-1 is
the Faculty team.

Pax 2 clipped past Watts | 2-1
opening night, and beat the
KAs 2-1 Wednesday. Larry Dun-
can, Mike Creaseman and Steve
Sulfas have sparked the early
victories.

Our Boys Gang (or OB(:) is a
team made up primarily of
seniors from 3rd and 4th Littie:
Tom Ross. Will Ryan, Duff
Bruce, Blain Abee to name a
few. In their only action thus
far. OBG nipped Watts II in a
hard-fought match 15-13. 16-14.

The Faculty, under the direc-
tion of Sterling Martin, has had
difficulty finding a set lineup.
and after opening with wins
over Delt If 2-0 and Emanon |
2-1. they were bumped from the
unbeaten ranks by Watts II
Wednesday in a close match.
Watts II copped the decisive
third game 15-11.

Besides OBG, SEA and the
Faculty , other new teams com-
peting in volleyball are Ernie‘s
Boys, which is essentially Sen-
telle I and II. under the lead-
ership of John White; Little IT,
a group of seniors independents
from that hall: and Bigs, another
senior team, named for “Big”
Alex Gordon. and organized by
Adrian Long and John Davis.

Volleyball play will continue
fer about the next two weeks.
until round-robin play in each
league is completed. after which
the top four teams in each will
compete in a single-elimination
tournament. Over-all won-lost
record will determine the cham-
pion.

‘Elsewhere in the IMAC, the
track meeting this Monday will
finalize details on that.

Tennis and softball compe-
tition will open April 3. Softball
will follow much the same for-
mat as flickerball and basket-
ball, but tennis has a brand
new look.

This year tennis will be open

to all teams of 2-4 men which
desire to participate. A round-
robin is scheduled among all
entries with won-loss records
determining the champion.

This is a switch from the
double-elimination tournament
used in previous years. Accord-
ing to intramural director Ster-
ling Martin, “This was done in
order to spread it out over a
longer period of time and allow
more people to play."

However, Martin cautioned
that ‘‘there is a possibility that
we will have to change back to
league play" if too many teams
enter.

week, and was unavailable for
comment.

Other teams scheduled to com-
pete in the tournament include

_UNC, N. C. State, Duke, East

Carolina, VPI and William and
Mary.

Despite the loss of last year’s
top player, Doug Clark, through
graduation, and number five and
six men Bill Guerrant and Scott
Sheftall, Boyd feels that “‘if
everything comes together, we
could have a_ pretty good
squad.”

Boyd, a junior who played
number two a year ago, has
moved up to the top spot, but
is being pressed by sophomores
Jim Ray and Dick Spinner, who
played at the third and fourth
slots, respectively, in 1971.

Boyd is the most experienced
and steadiest player on the
team, and his strengths are
driving and putting.

Ray, who finished sixth in the
Southern Conference tournament
last year, is an excellent iron
player who has been hitting the
ball well recently according to
Boyd.

Spinner, who excels. on the
Wildcat soccer team in addition
to his fairway duties, is prob-
ably the team's longest hitter.

Senior Dave Faison, in his
first year as a linkster, needs
only more consistency off the
tee to score well and ranks in
the fourth position.

Junior Sam Mitchener, vastly
improved over last year, and
freshman Bob Reni, who has
been plagued by inconsistency.
round out the top six positions.

Seven men will be used in
matches, with senior Steve Bat-
tle the most likely candidate to
gain the final spot. Others on
the squad include sophomores
Bill Higgins and Tony Martin,

freshman Richard Anderson
and senior Hugh Gaither.

Boyd speculated that “if the
top four men can put their
whole games together, we'll be
okay. Right now we're probab-
ly not as good as lasi year.”

The schedule shows four tour-
naments, including the Southern
Conference, plus matches with
William and Mary, N. C. State,
North Carolina, Ohio University,
Duke and ECU.

Besides this weekend, the oth-
er tournaments will be the Fur-
man Invitational and the Chris
Schenkel Invitational, which
Boyd termed ‘‘a really big tour-
nament,"' with the likes of Flor-
ida, Florida State, Wake For-
est and possibly Houston com-
peting.

Looking at the Southern Con-
ference, Boyd tabbed Furman
and ECU as the favorites, but
added, “if we come aro: nd, we
have a pretty good chance.”

It’s a young, inexperienced

team, but the season is long,
and by the time the conference
tourney rolls around on May
2-3 at Sanford,
ready.

it should be
