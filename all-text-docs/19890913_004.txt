How to handle a bout with h

“I can honestly say that I have felt no deep desire to return to Florida”

By DAVID COARSEY

For a month before I left for school,
my mother told me how much I was
going to miss home. She told me that no
matter what, I would get homesick. I
would respond the. same way every
time by saying: “Yes, and that’s going
to be the worst five minutes of my life.”

To some extent my joke has proven
true. I can honestly say that I have felt
no deep desire to return to Florida. The
simple fact is, regardless of everything
our parents have told us, most of the
freshmen have not been extremely
homesick.

There are a couple of possible expla-
nations for this. One is that there is so
much to do that no one has had time to
be homesick. There have been so many
ways to get involved in Davidson life,
that it has been easy for most people to
adjust to their new environment.

The second possibility is that we have
not been here long enough to feel ex-
tremely separated from home. After
only three weeks, Davidson still seems
a bit like summer camp.

Reality has begun to set in, study has
started, but for the most part Davidson
is a very new and exciting place. There
are always people to meet and new
things to do.

There is the possibility that home-

sickness will set in after we have been
here for a while and Davidson is not so
much fun anymore.

The people that have felt homesick-
ness strongly are usually the people
whoare either afraid to get involved in
their new college life or those who are
still clinging to their lives at home..

The only way to really combat this is
to dive headfirst into college life. By
doing so, you not only eliminate time to
sulk about home, but you also become
integrated into your new environment.

You find fun things to do, and you
meet others that share common inter-

ests.

The one common sentiment shared
among freshman is that they miss their
old friends. They miss the security
found in familiarity.

Those who have been or are home-
sick were often simply not prepared to
part with someone they had to leave
behind. Often these are the individuals
with boyfriends or girlfriends. Al-
though the extent to which this emo-
tion is felt varies, it is usually under-
stood by everyone.

The transition between the security
of lifeat homeand the excitement of life

omesickness

after you leave home is both invigorat-
ing and frightening. However, it is one
that everyone must go through.

Although in a strong sense of the
word, most of the freshmen have not
been homesick, ina weaker formevery-
one has felt it. Any time someone stops
and thinks about home, wonders how
his friends are doing, and: wishes he
could see them, we could call this
homesickness.

There is no way to completely avoid
this, but the sooner you become a part
of Davidson, the sooner you will view
it as home.
