Athletic
budget

released

By RICK JENKINS

Special to The Davidsonian

After years of keeping David-
son’s athletic budget under lock
and key, the Spencer Admini-
stration did an about-flip and
released it yesterday.

Spencer explained that the
budget had become such a
frequent topic of’ speculation
and discussion that ‘he felt it
would be less harmful to go
ahead and release it than to
allow people to continue to
make wild guesses about it.

The football and basketball
programs got the biggest ap-
propriations, the. figures indi-
cated. Football received about
27 percent of the athletic bud-
get, basketball received about
36 percent of the budget, physi-
cal education got about; 11
percent.

“Our level of competition
requires us to spend at least the
present amount of money on
football and basketball,” said
Athletic Director Thomas Cart-

The gross expenditures for
football and basketball in 1977-
78 were not far apart, being

$361,996 and $386,027 respec-.
tively. The net expense of each

program; -however, was quite
distant: ‘$234,642 for football
and: $309,890 for basketball.
The figures revealed that this
considerable difference existed
because the Wildcat Club: con-
tributed $104,354 to the football
program in 1977-78.

“Most of the Wildcat Club
money goes to football, but we

are trying to be fair to all of the

coaches,” Cartmill said. A side-
note to the budget said that
“approximately $40,000 in un-
budgeted contributions (are
made) by the Wildcat Club to

Trustees to face salary dilemma;

By JIM GARRETT
News Editor

The Trustees will discuss
whether to award the faculty
salary increase on Saturday,
according to Board of Trustees
Chairman Warner Hall.

“We have a responsibility to
the faculty and staff,’’ said
Hall, in explanation of the
decision to call a ‘‘special’’
meeting of the Trustees.

Saturday’s ‘‘special’’ meeting
is not an emergency measure,
according to College President
Samuel Spencer. ‘“‘The Trustees
simply want to further discuss:
the budget,’’ he said.

The Trustees met with
professors McKelway, Man-
ning, Davies, Ratliff, and B.
Patterson at their winter meet-
ing on February 22 and 23 to
discuss a proposal to increase
1979-80 faculty salaries by ten
percent.

McKelway presented a. pro-

professors seek ten percent increase

posal ‘‘to maintain the present,
unsatisfactory situation.’’ It
called for an 8.5 percent in-
crease to compensate for infla-
tion, a “statement of policy” to
restore past levels of real in-
come, a one percent increase to
demonstrate commitment to
this policy, and a .5 percent

increase in cases of special

merit.
McKelway urged that ‘the

faculty needs to believe that the:

Board will-not accept as a
permanent definition the pre-
sent economic status of the
faculty.”

McKelway observed that real
faculty income has dropped 15

percent in twelve years and four .

percent in the last two years.
He said shares are presently
$5,800 below the average for
Ph.Ds.

Physics Professor Robert
Manning said ‘‘The Trustees

must increase faculty salaries if

John Jackson beat Andy
Miller in Tuesday’s SGA presi-
, dential election. Richard: Terry,
who ran unopposed, will be the
newSGA vice president.

As the race for the presidency
developed, each candidate dis-
tributed literature that outlined
his platform. Jackson’s stated:
“I’m very excited about the
changes and decisions that will
be coming up at Davidson in the

-next year. I am confident that I

have the enthusiasm and expe-
rience to run:a very effective
Senate, one that would ‘ensure
that the students’ voice was
heard clearly as these campus
decisions are made.”

In his platform Jackson sta-
ted that he supported a strong
athletic program, “but it must
be appropriate for our school,
both in expense and personnel.”
He believes more money must
be given to minor sports and
women’s sports because ‘‘I
think that the sports that
Davidson can excel in are in
these two areas.” He said it
seems as if there is.interest on
campus for them but that
“these teams just don’t have
enough money to work with.”

This Saturday there will be a
Trustee meeting about athletics
and the budget. Jackson stated
that he will be talking to Thom
Young, Bruce Brown and Col-
lege President Samuel Spencer,
“to learn how to communicate
with them.” He said, “‘It will be
hard for me to speak .on behalf
of the whole student body or the
Senate since the Senate is in
transition. I will tell them that
people I talked to when I went
campaigning door to door indi-
cated that they want the budget
made public. I suspect. that
my will set up a committee to

pers the question incdjithes ‘isa
this will give us more time to
present our views to them.” :

Another part of Jackson’s
platform was his desire to see an
improvement. in commuhica-
tions between Trustees and
students. Jackson said that a
problem with the last Trustee
dinner was: ‘‘problems that we
think Trustees are insensitive to
are things they are not even
aware of.”

As a solution, Siuckaien sug-
gested the Trustees visit David-
son in small groups of three or
four, throughout the entire
year. “They should bring their
families, go to basketball
games, have open-ends.”’

Jackson also supported in his
campaign a merit-based admis-'
sions system. However he said,
“This in one thing that I can
probably do the least about.”
He pointed out, “If we had a
referendum then the students

‘would probably support it’ over-

whelmingly. The Trustees re-
cognize this so there’s no pro-
blem of communications. How-

A by now famous article by Marian

labeled Davidson's recruiting style ‘“‘ex-

Leifsen's article provoked a flurry of

Biedenbach specifically denied many

“I am not a high pressure recruiter, —
