Wrestlers beat Catawba, face Campbell

By DAVID DONALDSON
Staff Writer

Coach Bob Estock is optimi-
stic about. his wrestling team.
“I really feel strongly about our
eleven wrestlers,” he said, and
added, ‘“‘we’re still green (there
are five freshmen on the team)
but they’ve all worked hard and
I feel we’ll be successful.’’

Led by co-captains Rob King.
and Mike Garfinkel, the David-
son grapplers opened their sea-
son with the Catawba Invita-
tional Wrestling Tournament
on November 30 and. December
1. King received second in the
heavyweight class because he
had to forfeit the final to take
the LSATs. Pat McKinsey won
second in the 126 Ib. class;
Garfinkel placed third at 158,
and Scott Smith took fourth at
184.

Davidson's next match was a
dual match at Catawba on
December 5, which the ’Cats
won. 26-20. James Young (118
lbs.) and McKinsey (126 lbs.)
won by forfeiture, and Smith
(134 Ibs.), Van Wagner (158
Ibs.), Garfinkel (167 Ibs.), and
King (heavy weight) all decis-
ioned their opponents.

cember 8, a three-way match
between the Wildcats, Elon,
and the Citadel. Inexperience
showed as the Cats lost 36-23 to
Elon and 50-3-to The Citadel.
Against Elion, McKinsey won

by decision while Smith and
Tim Brotherton pinned their
men.. Garfinkel, winning by
decision, scored the only points
against the Citadel. The Wild-
cats were weakened by the
absence of. King, who was
taking the GREs.

Coach urges sportsmanship

Wildcat basketball coach Ed-
die Biedenbach urges Wildcat
fans to show their support for
the team this year, but to do so
without waving arms, shirts,
and towels at the end line durinf
the oppositions free throw. Dur-
ing the last few games at the
Charlotte Colisiem Cat fans
have taken use of this distrac-
tion to cause missed free throw.

the game to wave the hands

library at least four times a
week. In addition, the living
legend from Jersey has taken
over as the mentor of the college
bowl team, after besting erst-
while Coach Charlie Lloyd in a
battle of wits.

Over in the corner of the ball
we can make out Captain J.
Edgar Hughes who has ascen-
ded to the head of the C.I.A, He
has gained world reknown for
pursuing dogs all over the

Bie’ jenbach addea, ‘‘ I like

inebriation. So long, Butch.

On the other side of the ball
appears Joby Merten—balding
now— who has become presi-
dent of Davidson College, re-
placing the revered Sam Spen-
cer, who has gone off in retire-
ment to that paradise in West-
ern Massachusetts. The fore-
sighted “Uncle Joby” Merten
has instituted a number of new
programs, all designed to pat-
tern Davidson after the Cincin-
nati Reds. The school, it Seems,
is now building a 65,000 seat
baseball stadium and now offers
majors in bunting, losing, and
astroturf.

Any retired Red is offered a
position on the faculty, and
George Foster will head all
language departments. Fight-
ing and breast development are
heartily encouraged. By the
way, Joby’s spot on the college
bowl team has been taken away
by the peripatetic plenipoten-
tiary, Rob Monteeth.

Under the ball, B&BB have
spotted Theodore F. (Flint)
Gray, a social pervert who was
randomly selected by the Ouija
board to-.be an outlet for
B&BB’s hostilities. He gradu-
ated from Davidson in 1986,
married a labrabor retriever,
and has seven really cute pup-
pies. He smells like Kingsport,
Tennessee, and pants for the
Christmas kiss of his grand-
mother (if she’s still alive), who
inevitably slips him the tongue.
Rumor has it his mom’s a man
who’s wanted in five states.
Presently he heads the SPE
alumni association along with
Hooper Alexander the tenth.
Rob Monteeth refused to re-
place him.

As for B&BB, it seems we

} take a look at their fans ten years into the future

remain the omniseien, pienipo-
tentiaries we always have been.
B&BB continue to abuse any
unfortunate souls who fall in
our path.

And now, on to basketball.

There has been an upheaval
in the top ten this week. The
once esteemed Corpus Caverno-
sum lost ignominiously and
with the utmost disgrace to the
Guns of Navaronne. The game
was referreed well. Beaver,
Marvin, and Ports dealt for the
Gunners. Gary MacD. had 36
for the losers.

Cool Breeze and Hurtin 4
Certin both drubbed pitiful
freshman teams. James McLain
got 31 rebounds and Kevin
Hanna got nine steals for the
Breeze. Hurtin 4 Certin led by
Minor ‘Sinclair with 26 and
Sandy Donald with 29. Vince
Parker blocked a shot.

The Bricklayers edged out a
weak team. The rest of the Top
Ten was extremely idle.

A bunch of FIJIs did well in
B league play. So did some
other teams. The Kicked Balls
did well in a very well refereed
game. The Penal Strikers have
a good name, but a bad team.

We’ve done the Top Ten in
the wrong order to help hone the
analytical skills which have as
yet remained untouched due to
poor teaching by Humes pro-
fessors. Later.
