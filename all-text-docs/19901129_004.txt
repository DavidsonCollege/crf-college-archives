Advocating Activism

At Davidson where apathy is generally the rule, any form
of activism is usually newsworthy. The Middle East rally
staged by students on November 15 was suchacase. Davidson
students were given an opportunity to discuss the Persian
Gulf crisis thanks to the organization of seniors Bob Hornsby
and Molly Graver. Over 150 people signed a petition sent to
President Bush urging him to focus more on diplomacy rather
than aggression.

_ Yet more needs to be done. This week’s ulti#tamum by

President Bush ordering Iraq to leave Kuwait by January 1 or
face a military offensive is indicative of how close we are to
fighting another war. Students should have reason to be con-
velopments. Given the small population of

1970 Davidson students protested U.S. involve-
ment in Cambodia and shooting.-of students at Kent State.
The Student Government Association then adopted a resolu-
tion condemning the Cambodia and Kent State situations.
Three professors held peace vigils.

Letusnothave tocope with the horrors this college and the
nation had to confront twenty years. Additional expressions
of concern such as the one held recently need to take place.
Only by educating ourselves about the political situation and
alternative options the U.S. has can we hope to change the

tragic policy President Bush is pursuing in the Middle East.

The children, staff, and

Davidson-Cornelius
Daycare Center would like
to thank all Patterson Court
participants and especially
Greg Grooms and the Kappa
Alpha house for the fund-
raising party you held onour

The $1400-plus that you

community board of the -

donated far exceeded our ex-
pectations. As we work each
year to providea healthy and
educational environment for
the young children in-our
local community who'need
daycare, we hope for contin-
ued support of friends at the
College.

In addition to financial
contributions, we rely on
college students as volun-

teers in the classrooms. We
thank all of you, too, for
helping tomake the Daycare
Center a special place in the

Basketball Ticket Policy Clarified

To The Editors:

We would like to clarify
the basketball ticket policy
for students. Due to student
concern and confusion re-
garding the past ticket pick-
up procedure, we have met
several times to writea ticket
policy that we believe is in
the best interest of both the
students and the ticket of-
fice.

The basketball program
needs and deserves student
support. This policy makes
it easy for students to pick-
up tickets. Although it is
possible to get tickets right

before the game, the ticket
office prefers for them to be
picked-up the day prior toa
game. Because game day is
so hectic itis much easier for
them to accommodate stu-
dents on the day before the
game. Additionally, tickets

are distributed on a first

come, first serve basis, so
students will get the better
tickets if they pick them.up
early and will also.avoid the
chaos of picking up a ticket.
at game time.

Please respect this pol-

icy and do not forget that it
falls within the jurisdiction
