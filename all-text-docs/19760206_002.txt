Gergen, Widenhouse capture
coaches debate tournament ©

The Davidson College Var-
sity Debate Team captured
first place at the Duke Univer-
sity Coaches Tournament last
weekend in Durham.

_ The two-man duo of Gordon
Widenhouse, a senior from
Valdese, N.C. and Mark Gerg-
en, a sophomore from Frank-
furt, Ky. defeated George
Washington University in the
championship round to take
top honors. All of the five
judges evaluating the final
round voted for Davidson.

“Naturally, we are pleased
with the results of this type in
any tournament,” -explained
Widenhouse, the team cap-
tain. ‘‘But we have not de-
bated since mid-November, so
we looked at the Duke tourna-
ment as a warm-up for the
spring term.”

Twenty-four teams from
seven states attended the
event. Gergen and Widen-
house defeated William and
Mary in the semi-final round
to qualify for the champion-
ship debate.

The team finished with a 5-1
record during the preliminary
rounds, which seeded them as
the top team when the final
eight teams went into the
elimination rounds on Sunday.

“‘The strange thing about
the final three rounds was that
we debated on the affirmative
all three times,”’ said Widen-
house. ‘‘When two schools
have not met in a tournament,
there is a coin toss and the
winner selects which side it
wants. We lost two tosses but
both schools selected the neg-
ative position.”

Widenhouse received the a-
ward as the tournament’s top
speaker with 148 of 180 poss-
ible points. Gergen placed
seventh among the 48 speak-
ers.

Other schools which David-
son defeated in the Duke
competition include the Uni-
versity of South Carolina,
Richmond, South Florida,
Carson-Newman College and
another team from William
and Mary. In addition, teams
from Old Dominion, The Cita-
del, Virginia Military Insti-
tute, Wake Forest and Duke
participated. in the tourna-
ment.

The purpose of the Duke’

tournament was to honor the
coaches. Because Davidson
finished first, Ms. Jean Cor-
nell, the director of the David-
son program, received the
award as the top coach of the

The Senate adjourned after
meeting for two hours last
Tuesday night, having moved
through only four of 13 items
on its agenda.

The first item on the eve-
ning’s agenda was the filling
of various vacant positions.
The first to be filled were two
vacant slots on the faculty’s
Educational Policy Committee
(EPC).

The EPC’s involvement in
all areas of the curriculum,
combined with a pre-meeting
letter to stuideute ait
the openings, account for the
unusually high interest among

‘students in serving on the
committee. Ten people, inclu-
ding two senators, sought
appointment to one of the two
positions.

After 90 minutes of quest-
ioning candidates and debate,
the Senate elected Sam Craw-
ford and Bonnie Wright to the
two EPC posts. In winning

the appointments, the two
freshmen beat out a number of

The Senate appointed Rick
Fay as Student Administra-
tor of the security force. Fay
replaces Alan Malcolm as the
student who administers the
parking ticket system.

Cathy Howard was ap-
pointed Little Dorm Sénator
to fill the vacancy created by
Tenley Shewmake’s resigna-
tion.

After hearing committee re-
ports and a report on a Senate
workshop planned for this
weekend, the Senate moved to
the fourth item on its agenda.
Ed Sibley’s motion to request
that the faculty adopt a policy
of giving no reviews and
having no papers due on the
last three days of class, which
was made at a previous meet-

ing, was again brought up for |

debate.

The motion, however, be-
came tangled in a web of
substitute motions, amend-
ments, and amendments to

so it could be straightened out
for the next Senate meeting.

‘I was exremely pleased
with the way Gordon and
Mark debated,” Cornell noted.
“T think this year has been one
of the best for debate at
Davidson.”

The victory does continue a
very succesful year for both
the Gergen/Widenhouse team
and the Davidson program as

_a whole. Davidson teams have

also captured positions in the

Wald discusses origins of
cosmos, man’s Stellar role

By EDDIE POLLOCK

Harvard University Profes-
sor and Nobel Prize recipient
George Wald spoke at David-
son this week.

Wald, whose list of awards
and achievements includes the
1967 Nobel Prize for Medicine,
was late in arriving at David-
son because of heavy Northern

both on this planet and any-
where else. ‘‘After all,” said
Wald, ‘‘our universe is a very
special universe.”

Wald went on to comment
on various parts which make
up the cosmos. “Stars have to
die in this universe before
organisms can live,’’ he said,
noting how the first genera-
tion of stellar life came into
being, and how all living
things came from stars. ‘‘In

snows. However, his talks and
lectures with students and
faculty were not hindered.
The 69 year old professor
spoke on a number of topics.
Beginning with the universe,
Wald noted that we find
ourselves in a universe where,
if one single property of that
universe were altered, life
would become impossible,

fact,” said Wald, “stars are
like living organisms; they
have their own pathology,
their own metabolism, and
their composition is much like
our own.”

Wald said that 99 percent of
all things throughout the uni-
verse are dependent on four
principal elements: hydrogen,
carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen.

_ These elements formed the

basis of the universe as the
first generation of stars was
forming.

Wald also discussed life on

earth and other planets. In
order for life\to exist, he
maintained, two conditions
are essential. First, one must

-have conditions where it is

possible for water to be found
as.a liquid. Then, one must
have a planet which is big
enough, but not too big, to
support an atmosphere.

A principal topic of interest
throughout Wald’s visit at
Davidson was Man and Man’s

role in the universe.

“‘We’re not taking very
good care of things, not hu-
man beings, not of the earth,’
said Wald. He revealed some
facts about the nuclear arms
race. ‘‘Hydrogen warheads are
being produced in this country
at the rate of three per day; we
are told that our security lies
in Mutual Assured Destruc-
tion--MAD. It’s well named.”

Wald said that we are the
only creatures of our kind in
the cosmos. ‘‘For just as every
living organism is different
from itself moment to mo-
ment, we are the only human
beings in the universe.”

Perhaps most interesting
were Wald’s views on his
personal religion. ‘‘I don’t see
any reason to look for a
supernatural when we haven’t
even begun to scratch the
surface of the nature around
us.’’ Wald reads the Bible,
however. ‘‘Those are my
roots,’’ he said. ‘‘Look at
Lincoln and his Gettysburg
Address; that was King James
Bible talk. Our society has lost
the love of life that you find in
there.’’ According to Wald,
that love is what we despara-
tely need to Glecover.
