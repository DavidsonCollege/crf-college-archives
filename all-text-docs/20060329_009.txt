Retribution: Union Café employees begin stealing from students

A former Union Café employee has
leaked information to the Yow that
suggests the Café is pursuing a policy
of actively stealing from students.

The employee, wishing to remain
anonymous, has told the Yow] that
the Café has already implemented
many new policies which use deceit
or trickery to remove funds from stu-
dent CatCards and will seek new
methods in the future.

“I think the Union’steals from the
students because it feels it gets
ripped off,” the former employee
said. “The students steal from us.”

As described by our source, some
of the methods used by the Café were
to raise the prices of food without
posting the change and to add super-
fluous small charges, such as tea bags
and plastic containers at checkout.

“One of their trickiest methods is
to first have a cashier delay the stu-
dents by leaving the counter in order
to restock the Snapples or clean the
coffee station,” said the former
employee. “Then, while the students
are distracted and in a line, another
employee picks all of their pockets.”

While the Café has not admitted to
these charges, Café manager Roy White
offered some justification for such a policy.

“We see losses every day on small items
such as tea bags and candy bars, which stu-
dents either steal from us or don’t quite pay

Dear Yow! Editors,

I was wondering why all your staff
are women. It seems to me that the
lack of gender balance represents dis-
crimination. Men are funny, too. We
have a right to print our material in
your pages. I am disappointed that an
organization like yours, which
excludes people from its ranks, exists
on campus.

Sincerely,

‘Andrew Dreyfus ’09

Dear Mr. Dreyfus,

The fact that men choose not to join the
Yowl staff is unfortunate, but it is not due to
any discrimination on our
part. We encourage writers
of most genders to submit
articles and join us at staff
meetings. The Yow] chooses
to practice equality (except
when dealing with terror-
ists). Perhaps the men of
Davidson should ask them-
selves why they do not write
for the Yowl, rather than
why the Yow! does not have
male writers.

Dear Yow! staff,

I’m _ having trouble
with my internet con-
nection in my room;
Clean Access keeps a
telling me I need to ar ania: my defini-
tions or something, and whenever I
try it doesn’t let me connect to the
website that has all the definitions.
I’ve tried everything I can think of,
and I’m getting really frustrated.

Thanks for the help,

Megan Adler ‘o9

Dear Ms. Adler,

Unfortunately for you, the Yow! does not
use computers. We print stories with our
minds.

Hey Yowl Guys,

Do me a favor. When you smell “the
odor of marijuana” coming from my
room, stop calling the police. Just do
what I do and light some incense. Or
buy a plug-in.

Much love,

Your Upstairs Neighbor

see how it would be justifiable for us to steal
these losses back from the students.”

The anonymous employee also reported

you ever heard of an invitation? Puff, puff,

Dear Yowl,

I was most distressed to read the ad
you ran two weeks ago stating that
“Most Davidson College students
wear pants at least four times before
washing them.” This is a serious issue
that faces our campus and I would like
to see a more detailed article address-
ing the problem.

Sincerely,

William Mayes ’08

Dear Mr. Mayes,

You are right.
Not washing
pants regularly is
a serious prob-
lem at Davidson,
one which often
remains unheard
in public. Many
questions
revolve around
it: how does this
affect the
Laundry
Services’ ability
to serve the com-
munity? Should
we be concerned

about health
issues? | What
does this say

about the average Davidson student’s men-

tal condition? We intend to run a piece that -

looks seriously at all of these questions in
next week’s edition. And please, Davidson,
wash your pants.

Dear Yowl,

This is a cease and desist order on
behalf of Jeffrey, the Mailman Duck.
Your use of his image for your Yowl
mailbag is both unauthorized and ille-
gal. We demand that you pull his
image from your upcoming issue and
any future pointless mailbags you
may run in the future. Jeffrey is very
conscious of his image and does not
want it defiled in trash like this.

Sincerely, .

Thaddeus Millington, III, Attorney
at Law

Dear Jeffrey the Mailman Duck,

What happened to you, man? You used to
be cool. I can’t believe you let the mail go to
your head.

ing a prototype for a robot “employee” code
named Student Theft Enforcer and
Arbitrary Line Zapping Operational Robot
(STEALZOR). It was the employee’s failure
to program the robot with certain unethical

7 aspects that led to the dismissal.

“The idea is that STEALZOR will periodi-
cally ‘zap’ students in line and exiting the
café to ensure they aren’t stealing things. If
the student hasn’t paid for an item yet,
STEALZOR will start beeping and flashing,”
said the former employee. “What will not be
made public is that STEALZOR will also
have the ability to arbitrarily ‘zap’ CatCards
inside pockets or purses and withdraw
money from them.”

Many students have been suspicious of
deceitful Café policies for a while.

“Sometimes I will order four different
cheeses on my sandwich, but the Café
charges me for four different sandwiches,”
said Veronica Case ’o6. “Last time I checked,
a sandwich consisted of more than just
cheese. Often, it has bread as well.”

“Have you ever actually checked how
many ounces of liquid the cups hold?” asked
Trent Stewart ’07. “The 32-ounce cup really
only holds 28 ounces of soda, so they are
essentially lying in order to trick you out
four ounces of soda.”

“One little know fact,” said Tiffany
Dawson ’06, “is that a quesadilla actually
consists of eight parts. So when you check
half a quesadilla you should be entitled to
four quesadilla slices, but the Café tricks you

out of those extra slices.”

Further reports of Café employees steal-
ing from students have surfaced in the past.
Wendy Greene ’08 claimed that last week,
Union Café workers broke into her dorm
room and stole $60 out of her purse and her
U2 iPod.

“I was coming out of the shower and walk-
ing back down the hall when all of a sudden

— “While the students
are distracted and in
a line, another
employee picks all
their pockets.”

I saw two women dressed in Café uniforms
burst out of my room carrying my iPod and
some cash,” said Greene. “They sprinted
down the stairwell and I wasn’t able to fol-
low them because I was in a towel and carry-
ing my shower-caddy, but I was sure they
were Café employees.”
