IMAC

Witz, IFT dominate

By PAUL BANTA and
ALAN EDMONDS

Since Stiefel and Russ have

acclaimed the respective soft-.

ball and volleyball skills of Sid
Witz, we have decided that it’s
only fair that we report on
Witz’s domination of David-
son’s other spring sport, IMAC
Sailing.

Witz is the key to IFT’s an-
nounced plan of IMAC
domination. Just as Witz’s
slugging and spiking have
brought IFT success in softball
and. volleyball, he puts them
over the top in sailing too.

Standing on the bow of, the
boat, clothed in his Boy Scout
poncho, Witz is an awesome
sight. But there is utility in that
intimidating presence.

Attached to his arms are
nylon cords, which when
properly manipulated by<skip>
per Rob Canning, convert Witz
into a gigantic jib. In sailing of
this type, even the slightest
edge can be decisive, so we
look for the Thi’s to blow away
from the rest of the field.

The SPE’s plans were thwar-
ted when Commissioner
Bryan ‘‘Lord Chichester’’ An-
drews nixed their plans to use a
converted U-boat. Andrews
contended that submerging
violated the spirit, if not the let-
ter of sailing regulations.

In the words of his ruling, An-
drews stated, ‘Even for the
SPE’s, this usage of a U-boat is
sinking to a new low.”

Andrews’ remarks came just

two hours before his untimely
death. The Commissioner was
reported to have been tor-
pedoed while participating in
the IMAC swimming com-

products and services.

Returning to the proletariat
sports, softball is beginning to
show signs of producing some
almost interesting division
races, as the season has passed
the halfway mark and is win-
ding to a close.

In Division I, IFT, in a team
effort, eeked ‘out a close one
over_the SPE’s, 7-6, to remain
undefeated; but the SPE’s
bounced back to thrash hapless

Emanon, 15-1, on Jim Spears’ —

infield hits as Emanon put
forth the greatest array of er-
rors of judgement since Oedi-
Tooling you don’t) stuck it to
the once contending Chakras, 8-
5. Also, the Pika team dropped
to 5 games back in the all-
important loss column.

In Division II, Capt. Boxwood

bid a hardy farewell by for- ©

feiting for the second time, thus
strengthening the league. The
KA#1’s are stil] undefeated,
although the SAE’s hope to do
something about that when
their previously tied game is
continued.

The SAE’s flexed their
muscles in the meantime by

melting the Chocolate Speed-'

way, 20-14. (That was softball,
not flickerball.) The Kerwood
Derbies geared up for their up-
coming showdown with the
KA’s by slicing by PDT#3, 6-4.
