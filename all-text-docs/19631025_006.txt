it does.

Certainly, there's no organization today conduct-
ing more vital business than the business of the
United States Air Force, And very few organiza-
tions that give a college graduate greater oppor-
tunities for responsibility and growth.

As an Air Force officer, you'll be a leader on the
Aerospace Team—with good pay, a 30-day paid
vacation each year, educational opportunities.

How can you get started? For many, the best way
is through Air Force ROTC. But if you missed out
on AFROTC, or if there's no unit on your campus,
you can still apply for Air Force Officer Training
School. This three-month course leads to a com-
mission as a second lieutenant in the United
States Air Force.
