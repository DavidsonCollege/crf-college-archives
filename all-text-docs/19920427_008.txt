THE DAVIDSONIAN' OPINIONS

Pita Responds to Eglin's Letter

To the Editor,

lam writing in response to the
letter written by John A. Eglin of
the class of 1984. Iam sorry that he
still holds such resentment toward
the SAE house eight years after his
graduation. However, although he
cited many examples of things that
SAEs have done in the past (pri-
marily to the ATO house), I hope
he can realize that those “clean-
cut, starched, and pleasantly well-

mannered” SAEs he mentions
graduated along with him. In his
letter, he admits that he doesn’t
“know firsthand what’s going on
at Davidson now.” Therefore, I
feel thathis letter is irrelevantto all
the allegations brought against the
current SAE house. The SAEs he
speaks of all left college many
years ago, and we should focus on
the current students to investigate
the present problems. I believe

that weall (including alumni) must
stop pointing fingers at SAE as the
root of all problems on campus.
Instead, we should work together
as acommunity to finally continue
to move on with our lives and
enjoy our lives at-Davidson.

Alumnus Encourages You to "Dare to Fail"

Editor's Note: This letter was origi-
nally submitted to the Davidson
Journal and will be published in
the Summer edition. Due to.the
letter’s message to current students
Director of College relations Jerry
Stockdale passed it on to the
Davidsonian. Our thanks to Mr.
Stockdale.

Dear Editor:

My copy of Davidson Journal
(Volume VII) stirred three thoughts
I decided I should write down while
they’re sullalive. First, that learn-
ing in the “real world” of work
allows for more mixing of one’s
interests than many graduate
schood programs. Second, that
Davidson graduates are better pre-
pared to make the most of real-

world learingn -- better prepared ~

to see connections and pursue them
without the structure of a graduate
school curriculum -- than most
other college graduates. And third
that Davidson graduates are proba’
bly more insecure than others in
this ability, and in the validity of
working-to-learn after college.

I certainly don’t aim to con-
vince my classmates who went
immediately to earn graduate de-
grees that they shouldn’thave. This
Message is for new graduates,
because an alternative to immedi-
ate enrollment in grad school based
on the samc motivation (that is;
fulfillmetn of individual potential)
is stated more rarely than the case
for grad school. Ther is an alter-
nate scenario followed by more
people than you might think.

I’ll start with my own case

(youmight have guessed as much)..

I left Davidson without a clear
direction. I won’tsay nodirection,
but conflicting ones. From early
vocational aptitude tests admini-
stered in the ninth grade, I had
shown -interest in forestry and
writing, but they seemed to canc-

esleach other. For forestry, the

official response was: “People who
choose this occupational goal do
not usually prefer the school sub-

jects and activities you like.” In
short, I should “think about other
occupational arcas more in line
with (my) interests and abilities.”
This perplexed me for years as I
studicd Humanities during the
school year and experimented with
jobs on farms and ‘exterships’ with
the Forest Service in summers. I
enjoyed both, but saw no sign of
overlap. In spring of senior year,
resigned, I signed up forinterviews
with Kroger and Georgia Pacific,
thinking that was as close as I
could get toa field that didn’ texist.

Instead, I ended up in Africa
with the Peace Corps, where I
learned about agroforestry, a rela-
tively new fiels (for scientists, not’
for farmers) of combining agricul-
tural and tree crops for better farm-
ing, practiced mostly in develop-
ing countries. I now work as an
editor of research in this field where
anthropology, genetics, econorh-
ics, agriculture, and forestry inter-
sect. My generalist Davidson
background helps me tocommuni-
cate new concepst and practices to
people with varying backgrounds.

Some readers might have seen
this as a solutions to my dilemma
several paragraphs ago. But I
didn’t, and if I had gone to gradu-
ate school straight outof Davidson,
I would never have found this
twilight zone where my interests
meet. There were no U. S. gradu-
ate programs in agroforestry when
I graduated from Davidson, and
there likely never will be programs
in interdixciplinary comminica-
tions for agroforestry. The pointis
that by working and learning on
my Own, opportunities appeared
that helped me to define my op-
tions.

Many other alumni have found
careers in areas like film and jour-
nalism, fields that they were not
initially attracted to because of the
stereotypes associated with them.
But by mixing the range of his or
her interests, a Davidson graduate
can make a job expand beyong the
confines of a career stereotype.

This rumination is clearly not
for people who know thier goals
and have idintified programs that
match them. But if you know you
are ‘grad school quality’ but don’t
feel an innercertainty of what field,
if you are thinking that by enroll-
ing is a mark of tentativeness and
failure: Stop! Working for two or
three years in a field you may be
only vaguely aware of can help to
focus your goals.

You can enter graduate school

later, in a program tailored to your
interests. Your motivation and
chance of success will be a lot
greater for it.

Most Davidson student are
hard-wired for successand sociae-
tal approval; there’s little risk of
them ‘dropping out’ from life. The
freater risk is to settle for less,
followed by frustration and later
resignation. Short-term ‘failure ©
(failure to difine yourself, to get
on the fast track, to settle down,
etc.) can spur the psyche that
creaves approval, like most of ours,
through different and more imagi-
native channels. Therefore, let your
motto be “Dare to fail!’

Becausechances are, you have
many more tools than’ you think
you nave for moving between
commonly travelled career paths.
Woth a Davidson education, you
can work through various combi-
nations and alternatives -- you can
think. Don’t sell the ability in
exchange for the security ofa well-
travelled career path and immedi-
ate approval form others. Dealay
your gratification! You are-better
able than anyone else to find a way
to combine your interests in your
work. It just might takeacouple of
years of your time and offort. Dare
to ‘fail’! The Careers Office may
be able to put you in touch with
alumni in different (possibly con-
flicting) fields of your interest.

The End Is In Sight!

As the end of this school year
quickly approaches, we, the stu-
dents, prepare
for a final test of

stereo blaring and all. _
Of course, the administration

is largely. to

blame. It has

our endurance
and stamina. I’m
not talking so
much about ex-
ams but about
studying for ex-
ams in weather
that is, atthe very
least, amazing. A
-friend of mine
that graduated a
year ago noticed
that if he ever

not escaped
my notice that
exams are in-
tentionally
scheduled ei-
ther in the last
week before
Christmas’ or
during opti-
mum_ tanning
time. | Dean

afraid it’s true. I Chambers
may not pick up lawn, and

my racket from Spring Break until
the end of April, but during exams,
I’musually part of a doubles group
that redefines the word procrasti-

to be his undoing in more ways
than one. As we were playing next

gether on residence halls and
heightened competition in areas
ranging from intramural field to
parties. This competition was
regarded as unhealthy at times:
sometimes pranks became mali-
cious and dangerous. Students
believed that the trend at Davidson
was toward still greater identifica-
tion with fraternities.
And these:
A sizeable number of women felt
strongly that the College still con-
sidered itself a men’s school pri-
“marily. They believed that men,
particularly fraternity men, re-
ceived special treatment, especially
from the Dean of Students Office.
You can sugggst that a longer,
more professional process of “‘in-
terviewing, analyzing, and study-
ing” campus life has beenneglected
here at Davidson. I disagree. The
. Select Committee: seems to have
~heard and: voiced words spoken
before. Perhaps at firstthose words
were said more “politely,” with
less force and urgency: Perhaps
they were buried too deeply within
ourlongreport. But thetimecomes,
as Flannery O’Connor says, that
“to the hard of hearing you shout,
and for the almost-blind you draw
large and startling figures.”

maybe arrange for a Reggae band
and barbecue and...oh, sorry, that’s
first day on the Court...but after
next year it won’t seem too ¥epeti-
tive. If the demonstration doesn’t
come to fruition, maybe SGA can
organize a forum at the lake cam-_
pus. Actually, that would be a
great way to get people to study
since nobody goes to forums of all:
things. The lake campus would
seem positvely desolate. :

The Select: Committee was
formed by the President'to respond
to a crisis situation. In order to
provide their report within the
President’s three week limit; they
met three hours a day, five days a
week. ! 3 9

The Task Force on the Quality
of Student Life, having had more
time toreach its conclusions, ended
its work by acknowledging that,
while it could make many individ-
ual commendations and recom-
mendations, often it hadonly begun
to identify and explore problem-
atic portions of the quality of stu-
dent life and that valid “‘prescrip-
tions” for those areas deserved
more detailed study than the task
force’s limited time and resources
permitted. a

We knew that, after many
months of investigation and explo-
ration, the bulk of the hardest work
remained to be done. The Select
Committee’s report, written in re-
sponse to immediate crisis, reiter-
ates that challenge
