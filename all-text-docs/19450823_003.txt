is a far
cry from the-slow: and ponderous
Struggles of the acients: and offers
marked contrast even to the military
science and implements of our own
civil war period.

In time of peace likewise, techni-
ques and equipment are of necessity
abandoned, disregarded or destroyed
to make way for something better.
In all areas of life this is a law of
progress which often assumes the
role of ruthless imperative. In
manufacturing and _ business life
great sacrifices are frequently made
in order to improve the product
or simplify the. procedure. It is a
commonplace experience that which
is today thought to be “the last
word” is tomorrow found to be out-
moded and obsolete.

Nowhere is this inexorable law
of life more clearly illustrated than
on the college campus. In spite of
an inherent tendency to hallow the
past and revere the inherited tradi-
tions of the founding fathers, the
authorities of modern educational
institugfons realize the necessity
of keeping pace with a fast moving
procession of improvement. If the
price of obsolescence is high in
education, the discovery of new
methods and better devices is con-
stant — and the urgency of their
use often obligitory. In the area of
the physical at least, what was
considered by our fathers and
grandfathers to be the summum
bonum is today recognized as.un-
suited for present needs.

Not alone in the strictly utili-
tarian is felt this necessity of desire
for change. With the passing of the
years there has come to civilized
man a new appreciation of beauty
and a better understanding of the
value of harmony in design and
artistries. That “a thing’ of beauty
is a joy forever” has deeper im-
plications today than when the
phrase- was first uttered. Accus-
tomed as we are to hear of “the
beauty of holiness”, in recent years
there has been a new. emphasis
placed upon the fact that there is
also a holiness of beauty.

The builders of the original quad-
rangle at Davidson College, more
than a century ago, were doubt-
less influenced by the architecture
of the University of Virginia as
there is much in common between
the two styles. It is unfortunate
that those who were responsible in.
later years failed to follow the neo-
classic pattern of the founders. The
campus of the nineties became a
hodgepodge of varied and conflict-
ing periods and contours. In more
recent years the desired unity of
design has been re-established; a
fact well illustrated by the new
Chambers Building, the Grey Memo-
rial Lbrary, and its companion, the
Martin Science Building. It is a-
greed by present authorities that
in the construction of the post-war.
Period this predominate style will
be followed.

In 1888, Professor Henry Louis
Smith, later president of Davidson
and now a resident of Greensboro:
began the agitation for a Y.M.CA.
building.., Since 1855 a student—or-
ganizaton known as the “Williams
Society” had served the: spiritual
needs of the men on the campus.

NEW MAJOR ARRIVES

Major Reichel Assumes Head
R.O.T.C. Military Department

In 1879 it had become known as the
college Y.M.C.A. Dr. Smith led in
the effort to raise funds for the
erection of a combination Y.M.C.A.
—Gymnasium building and in 1888
visited about fifty churches in the
south and successfully presented the
need. The following year when Dr.
urated as president, his first official
John Bunyan Shearer was inaug-
act was the presentation of $500 to
the building fund. Before the fund
had reached the required $4,000, the
contract was let and at Commence-
ment 1890 the corner-stone of the
first Y.M.C.A. Building on a south-
ern campus was laid with elaborate
ceremonies. After the completion of
the exercises, Dr. George Summel
(of the, class of 1870, now a resi-
dent of New Orleans and Davidson’s
oldest living alumnus) mounted the
rostrum and after explaining the
“A.B.” stood for “A Begger” proved
that he deserved the degree by
promptly raising the final six hun-
dred dollars.

The college catalogue of 1892
describes the new edifice as follows:
‘ft is a handsome and massive
two-story building, sixty-cight feet
by forty-three. The lower story
with a gallery all around, is a gym-
nasium and the upper story
divided into an assembly hall, a
parlor and a Bible-class and reading
room. The whole is neatly and even
elegantly furnished. . . It is called
the Morrison Memorial Hall, in
honor of the first president of the
college. It is the first building of
its kind to be erected on the campus
of a southern college.”

And now after a half century of

is

service the old building is to take’

its place along with old Chambers
(which burned November 28, 1921),
and the Martin Chemistry Labora-
tory as the, focus of memories of
happy associatons and fruitful years.
During its fifty-five years of ser-
Pice parts of Morrison Hall have
at one time or another served as a
Y.M.C.A., a study hall, a gymnasium,
a skating rink; a lecture hall, a
dormitory, class rooms, a biological
laboratary, R.O.T.C Armony and
storerooms, and more recently has
housed the student store. It has
been variedly known as: “Morrison
Hall”, the “old gym”, the “Eagle's
Nest”, “Jackson Hall” and “The
Stud” . Its walls inclosed the first
shower bath, with hot and cold
water, to appear on “the hill” “Al-
though many buildings have been
erected since the turn of the century,
this was the only one to be con-
structed on the campus during the

‘

forty years between 1860 and 1900.
Having no essential architectual
character or “blending” with other
campus buildings, it has of late years
been recognized as a distinct eye
sore. During the coming week the
old structure will feel the impact of
hammer-and saw as a crew of work-
men begin the task of its annihila-
tion. The campus will thereby be
beautified and the way cleared for
buildings in the post-war era, The
plaintive words reading: “Dear
Santa Claus: Wanted, a new gym”,
(inscribed by students on the south
door—a 1941 holiday prank) will be
heeded when war restrictions are
fifted and construction begins again
at Davidson.
