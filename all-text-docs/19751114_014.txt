Staff Writer
For the past month, the

members of the 1975-76 Dav-
idson Wrestling Team have
been in the wrestling room
preparing for the upcoming
season. Assistant Coach
Frank Rader has been direc-
ting the team through rigo-
rous preseason drills. Coach
Rader has the nucleus of last
year’s team returning, and
several freshmen are expected
to fill in openings caused by
graduation and transfers.

Senior Ralph Holloway will
be back this year, and will be
starting his fourth season in
the 167 lb. weight class. The
middle of the lineup will
feature third year veterans
Mark Scankling and Bob
Price.

The Cats will be well repre-
sented in the lower weights, as
Brian Jacobs, Pete Hotchkiss,
and Glenn Ballard have all
returned. Ex-diver Ted
Mumby is expected to fill in at
118 for ex-Davidson student
Mike Dosal, who has trans-
ferred to Florida. Freshman
Pat Dulany is expected to
muscle his way into the

starting position in the 142
Ib. class.

Coach Rader is anxiously
awaiting the end of the grid-
iron season, so he can fill the
upper weight dividsions.
Freshmen Scott Phillips,
Terrell Rhye, and sophomore
Jack Summe are expected to
bolster the upper weight
classes,

Rader also expects sopho-
more Roger Brown, junior
Kevin ‘‘Cleets’’ Clancy, and
frosh Joe Saunders and Pete
Johnson to see some action

The Davidson girls’ basket-
ball team began practice Mon-
day in preparation for the
opening of their third season
of play.

Their first game, slated for
December 6, will be played at
Clemson.

The girls practically formed
the team themselves as fresh-

this year.

Radar has an optimistic
outlook for the season. He
feels that if he can get the
“wrestlers out of the library
and onto the mat, this year’s
team has the potential to be
one of the best wrestling
teams of the past five
seasons.”

This, optimism and_ the

Catawba Invitational Tourna-
ment.

men and have been together
since then.

“The team maturing’ toge-
ther combined with the new
blood of the freshmen this year
should give us a good season,”
said Ken Schmader, assistant
coach.

The -returning players,
forming the nucleus of the
team, includes Beth Tanner
and Nora McNeil on defense,
with Rene Soos and Nancy
Mathey as strong shooters.

Promising fast inside play,
starting as center will be
Donna Sherril, supported by
Catherine Morton and Bonnie

Caulkins, both strong under —

the board.

‘The girls really want to
play and are enthusiastic and
hustle a lot during practice,”
said head coach Mrs. Rosa Lee
Janaro.

The coaches feel that, over-
all, the team is strong, and
should at least equal last
year’s seasonal record of 10-7.

“People better come out and
watch us,’’ said Schmader,
“‘because'we’re going to have a
darn good season.”

year’s apathy. ‘‘It’s re-
freshing.”’

Davidson’s eagerness and
agressiveness was quite ob-
vious in the Wildcat’s 98-81
exhibition victory over Ath-
letes-In-Action last Saturday.
The Wildcats, down by eight
points at half-time outraced
their older rivals by scoring 62
points in an explosive second
half offensive show.

* John Gerdy led the Wild-
cats with 30 points hitting on
15 of 22 shots, and Eppa
Rixey grabbed 15 rebounds,
scored 14 points and blocked 5
shots to dominate the touring
group of former college
players.

Davidson shot 57.9 percent
for the game and only had six
turnovers in the second half
after a sloppy first half in
which the Wildcats made 16
turnovers and collected 18

fouls.
Jorgensen tallied 12 as-
sists, and blocked a shot.

Pat Hickert was 6 of 9 from
the floor, and had 8 rebounds.
Tom Dore was 4-7, with 5
rebounds and 2 blocked shots,
and Marvin Lively, who
started and fouled out early in
the second half, had 3 steals
and blocked a shot.

Although Brickels was not
displeased with the offense in
the second half, he did not
consider the exhibition to have
been well-played.

‘‘We’ve had five scrim-
mages during practice and this
was our worst,” Brickels com-
mented. ‘‘Our transition from
offense to defense was weak
and defense was about half a
step off most of the time.

“Offensively we passed the
ball more in the first half,
which gives us a better shot
selection, and better offensive
rebounding.”
