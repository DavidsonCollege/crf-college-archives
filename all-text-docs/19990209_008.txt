Ladies and gentlemen, repeat after me: vagina
(you) clitoris (you) vulva (you) penis (you)
testicles (you) ‘pubic hair (you). It’s not easy, is
it? It isn’t comfortable, either. People think you
are a sexually frustrated freak-show for saying
these forbidden words out loud without warning or
context. Little do they know that you are just
warming up for Human Sexuality Week, spon-
sored by the Rape Awareness Committee (R.A.C.).

R.A.C. invites all members of the Davidson
Community to join in our celebration of sexuality,
sensuality, and the body. It starts Thursday, Feb.
11 and lasts through Sunday, Feb. 14. The buzzword
for Human Sexuality Week will be communica-
tion. Our main goal is to help students recognize
and feel more comfortable talking about their
bodies, experiences, and feelings. These commu-
nication skills can be applied to sexually intimate
situations, where clear verbal communication is
necessary to obtain consent for all degrees of

In addition to enhancing communication
skills, Human Sexuality Week’s events aim to
raise some important questions. We will attempt
to answer questions like: how would you define
sexuality? How would you define sensuality?

What’s the difference between a sensual experi- —

ence and a sexual experience? How large a part
does sexuality play in the experience of being
human? What makes me a sensual or a sexual
person? Can you be asexual person without being
sexually active? What is it like to be a virgin at
Davidson? These are just a few of the questioned
that will be addressed, in particular, at the CROP
lunch sponsored by the R.A.C. on Thursday.

If Human Sexuality Week has a message, it’s
that you don’t have to be sexually active to be a
sexual human being. We’re out to show that
sexuality can be uniquely defined by an individual
in terms of his or her spirituality, body, language,
rhythm, art, and sensuality. Redefining one’s own
sexuality is an empowering endeavor that builds
self-esteem and helps prevent occurrences of rape

ra

sexual activity between partners. and sexual assault for both men and women.

Come out, support,
interact, enjoy!

There is relief from the flood of teviews,
papers, and exams. Spring break is just around the
corner. If you are still looking for plans, let David-
son Outdoors help. Davidson Outdoors has a couple
of tricks up its sleeve to help make your break one
to remember. I had the chance to sit down with the
President of D.O: Mr. Kurt Yusi, and he gave me

the down low on the sweet times that are avail-
able this break.

Davidson Outdoors is sponsoring two offi-
cial trips with the possibilities of a third. The first
trip is cosponsored with the Hurricane Island
Outward Bound center in Big Pine Key, Florida.
This is D.O.’s sailing adventure. Two boats with
atotal of eleven people each will be setting off for
five days to navigate the crystal waters of the
Keys. The boats will sail from one palm tree lined
