V. P. I. WRESTLERS
MEET
VARSITY SATURDAY

—

~ THE SPORTS PARADE

PRELIMINARIES
IN BOXING
BEGIN TOMORROW

Both the varsity and freshman basketball
teams will bring their schedules to a close

within the week. Tomorrow night the var-
sity and freshmen play a double-header with
the varsity and yearling teams of Carolina
at Chapel Hill. Friday the two Davidson
tcams journey to Raleigh to meet quintets
representing N. C, State. The freshman
game will be its final on the Davidson sched-
ule, but the varsity will not close its season
until next Tuesday, when Lynchburg Col-
lege visits Davidson for the second meeting
between these two teams this season,

Wrestling and boxing also have their
place on the card. for the week. The
matmen will play hosts to V. P. I. here
Saturday in what will be the last home
match of the season for the Wildcats.
Preliminaries, and possibly finals, will be
held in the boxing tournament which
Captain Pritchett has planned to start to-
morrow afternoon in the basketball gym-

nasium.

Coach “Red Laird let us tag along behind
his proteges to Winston-Salem last Satur-
day night, and we must admit that although
Davidson suffered defeat, she played one of
the best offensive games we have ever seen
a Davidson team play. The forty-four points
scored by the Wildcats were the most scored
by a Davidson team in any game in the last
two years, It was twelve points more than
the number scored in any game this season.

Fred Dickerson,
played his usual
Wake Forest, and several times made
opposing guards look sick by his fakes.
Because of his diminutive size, Dicker-
son had the
dering why Coach Laird used such a
small man at center, but all doubts were
removed when they saw Fred go into
the air and control the tip-off several

|
Too much Mulhern and Malloy proved too |
much for thé Wildcats and the lead set by
these two Wake Forest stars was just one
point too great for the Davidson efforts to
overcome,

Harris, Ross, and Peabody also played
brilliant games against Wake Forest.
Harris started the Davidson rally in the
second half and kept it going by inter-
cepting several Deacon passes and drib-
bling or passing down for shots at the
basket. His seventeen points was the
highest individual total of the game and
also high, for the season among the
Wildcats. Harris came out of a slump,
in which he failed to score a field goal
and only five fouls in four games, to tally
seven times from the floor and three
from the free throw line.

Ross committed his first foul in intercol-
legiate play against Wake Forest Saturday
night, and before the game was over he had,
three chalked against him, Despite the fouls
his game was much improved. Captain Pea- |
body again committed too many fouls and)
had to be removed before the final whistle,
but while he was in the game his play was
brilliant.

In the only game of the inter-fraternity
basketball tournament during the week
the Betas barely nosed out the S. A.
E.’s, last year’s champions, by a score
of 34 to 33. The victory gave the Betas
the right to meet the Pikas to deter-

mine a finalist to oppose the Kappa Sigs. |
