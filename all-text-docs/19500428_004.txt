But in the eighth grade the sport-
ing blood reigned supreme and
it was back to the gridiron as a

powerful build convinced his prep

Grover reported to Bloody Bill

_ja past master. Claude is busily at

work convincing his audiences in
so many words that this is a class
struggle. For ole George used to
be a good guy, but now he is back-
ed by big money and big business,
the “arch-enemies” of the com-
mon man.

And Claude has two other fac-
tors to his advantage. Anyone in

not wish to vote for Claude, he

As a soldier Grover has drawn
fame second only to that of his
athletic prowess, Cadet Lt. Lee has
cut a mean figure on the drill field
all year and it will be Lt. Lee, U. S.

days of advanced training at . Ft.
Benning this summer. Only certain
graduates are eligible for this school
but Grover has made his mark.

In selecting Lt. Lee for advanc-

in Washington. But to the dismay
of his opponents, people still attend
his rallies, and businessmen care
very little over who obtains them
certain legislation or favors as long
as it is obtained.

The deciding factor will be the
vote of the middle income bracket.
And the race becomes hotter and
hotter as that May day approach-
es. At this ‘point. both sides are
predicting victory, but an observer
might justly say that things look 9
bit brighter for George than for

Claude. However, anything can
happen, and probably will.
