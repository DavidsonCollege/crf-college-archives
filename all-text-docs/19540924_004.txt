To Demonstrate Cue

Charles C. Peterson, Father of
Inter-Collegiate “Billiards”, is in
our midst. This season marks the
24th annual tour of colleges by the
eminent cue artist, whose trade
mark is—‘“Show Me A Billiard Shot
I Can’t Make.”

Peterson, holder of the World's
Fancy Shot Billiard Title, appears
today and tonight in the David
Ovens College Union.

His exhibition includes not only
his wizardry of the trickiest shots
in the Ivory Sport, but a demonstra-
tion of world famous shots of other
star$ past and present, fundamen-
tals of the game, playing lecture
and group teaching to students.

Peterson’s missionary work for
the game he loves has extended in-
to every part of the country. He
undoubtedly has taught the funda-
mentals of the game to more per-
sons than any other man in the
world.

He has made it his business
while on tour to include in his ex-
hibitions a lecture on the theory

and practice of the game, illustrat-
ing the various fundamentals so
clearly that even one who never
has had a cue in his hand can
grasp the ideas advanced.

Ranked among the greatest bil-
liardists of all time, Peterson comes
to Davidson under the auspices
of the Association of College
Unions, who have sponsored his
tours since their inauguration at
the University of Wisconsin in
1931.

He will show the most daring
shots played in championship com-
petition. His repertoire of faney
shots include the greatest in ap-
peal and numbers in cue history.
Moreover, Peterson customarily
gives individual instructions for

Ways Up the Ladder,” in which
prominent businessmen from this
area will discuss the requirements
for success in the business world.

Tentative plans for later meet-
ings center around such topics as
labor-management problems, gov-
ernmental and business relations,
and the truckers versus railroads
dispute.

months after the close of the com-

petition.

eight musicals, including “Show
Boat,” played Squire Hardcastle in
“She Stoops to Conquer” and star-

Grant Johannesen

The final performance on the
Davidson Artist Series, April 15,
will be a concert by Grant Johan-
nesen, a pianist who in ten years
before the public has won the ae: |
claim of audiences and critics of |
three continents.

Since making his New York de-|
but in 1944, Johannesen has ap- |
peared in almost all of the major}
cities and with the nation’s out: |
standing orchestras. In 1949 he}
won first prize in the International |
Piano Competition in Belgium and |
so great was his success in Europe
that he returned to Holland in
1952 to record five concerti for|
Concert Hall. |

The South American tour of the |
artist was a triumph, and he is|
to return again this year. He per. |
forms in the Telephone Hour “fam. |
ily,” on N.B.C.’s “Standard Hour,” |
and A.B.C.’s “Piano Playhouse.”

Season tickets ($10) are available
to the general public and single
admissions ($2) will be sold at all
individual performances; there are
no reserved seats. All presentations
are to be held at 8:15 p.m., except
for the second afternoon perform-
ance of the Dublin Players, in the
Chambers Auditorium. Information
and tickets may be obtained by |
