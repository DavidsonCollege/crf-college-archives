Dave Barry kicked off his presi-
dential campaign February 6 at
the University of lowa.

The Pulitzer Prize-winning
columnist for the Miami Herald
arrived two-and-a-half hours late
after missing his plane, but still
managed to squeeze in a press
conference, a debate and State of
the Union address.

During his press conference,
Barry said that he would appoint
University of Iowa president
Hunter Rawlings as secretary of
state. “If he misses three Cabinet
meetings, he’s out. .That’s the
rule. I’m going to be that kind of
law-and-order president,” Barry
said.

Barry’s campaign manager,
Ted Habte-Gabr, an Ethiopian
exchange student, greeted the
candidate with the Barry-mobile,
a rusted Honda Accord with
“Barry 92” license plates.

Later, several Iowa students
dressed in trench coats, shiny
black shoes and dark glasses
whisked their presidential choice
into a black limo and off to an
lowa pig farm.

Palestine Solidarity
Committee Chair
Speaks On the Middle East

By Will Boye

Last Wednesday, the Dean
Rusk program played host to
speaker Jeanne Butterfield, Na-
tional Chairperson for the Pales-
tine Solidarity Committee. But-
terfield’s speech, given in Eu Hall,
focused upon Israel’s continuing
occupation of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, and the indirect en-
dorsement of these policies made
by the U.S. government through
foreign aid. Butterfield spoke out
against the $10 billion request for
housing loans made by the Israeli
government by questioning fur-
ther support of “a nation that re-
peatedly violates human rights in
the Middle East.”

Butterfield began her speech
by contrasting the recent interven-
tion of the U.S. in Kuwait with the
long-standing apathy thathas been
displayed by the U.S. towards the
occupation of the Palestinian terri-
tories. Butterfield defined this sort
of foreign policy asa“‘double stan-
dard”; one which would forbid the

U.S. from abiding the Iraqi occu-
pation of Kuwait for a matter of
“months, but one which tolerates,
andevenencourages financially, a
- hostile occupation by Israel for a
period of twenty-five years. Fail-
ing even to utilize sanctions as a

means of persuasion, the U.S. sup-
ports “the continuing denial of
human and national rights” in the

West Bank and Gaza Strip, Butter-
field sai
She went on to describe the

military occupation of the Pales-
tinian territories, which maintains
a direct control over sixty percent
of the West Bank and an estimated
fifty percent of the Gaza Strip. Since
1967, Butterfield said, 1300 mili-
tary orders have been enacted which
blatantly intrude upon every aspect
of the lives of the Palestinian occu-

" pants of these territories. Ranging

from extraordinarily restrictive
boundary lines in the region to
arbitrary arrests and interrogations
of “security suspects,” these mili-
tary orders have been designed to
cripple the fragile Palestinian econ-
omy from the outset, and with the
inception of the Gulf War, Butter
field noted, conditions only wors-
ened,

“We have a responsibility to
respond,” she said. “It’s our tax
dollars which pay for this occupa-
tion.” Israel, she explained, is the
single largest recipient of U.S, aid
in the world today, receiving $3.1
billion each year before any addi-

Davidson Professor Authors Anthology

By Will Boye

Dr.Rosemarie Tong, a
Davidson College philosophy
professor and Thatcher professor
of Medical Humanities, is the
author of a new book that aims to
shed some light on the multidi-
mensional subject of feminism.
Ananthology of feministreadings,
Feminist Philosophies: Problems,
Theories and Applications, is a
collaborative effort shared by
Professors Janet A. Kournay and
James P. Sterba, a husband and
wife team from the University of
Notre Dame.

The book is divided into two
distinct parts, one containing read-
ings about contemporary problems
which women face today and the
other dealing with feminist theo-
ries. According to Tong, this par-
tition allows for an understanding
of the relevance which many of

these theories have in our culture.
After readers have gone over such
issues as sexuality, reproduction
and the domestic scene, they can
then peruse the various theories
and determine for themselves
which has the most appeal.

Sterba, a philosophy professor
who has done extensive work on
the subject of justice, was the ac-
tual originator of the idea for the
book. Sterba had known very little
about feminist philosophy and pro-
posed the collaboration as ameans
of education, both for himself and
readers. A principal aim was not
only to explain the theories, but to
demonstrate their application
within the book.

Another objective of the book
is to challenge the stereotype of
feminists as “strident, unattractive
women angrily demanding the
abandonment of the family, the

desertion of husbands, the killing
of fetuses, or perhaps just the
burning of bras.” According to
Tong, a great goal of feminism, as
well as the book, is to illuminate
the diversity that exists among
women and to celebrate it; with-
out, however, becoming so diverse
that a forfeiture of a political or
social platform is necessary.

Tong is currently director of
Davidson’s concentration in medi:
cal humanities and also teaches a
class in “Feminist Thought.” In
1986 she was named U.S. profes-
sor of the year by the Council for
the Advancement and Support of
Education, an honor recognizing
superior undergraduate teaching.
Tong has authored four books on
feminism and ethics and is under
contract to write others in the fu-
ture on feministethics and medical
morality.

Former NATO Special Advisor
Speaks On the Status of the Middle East

By Chris Wells

Last Wednesday, as part of
“Middle East Week”, the Dean
Rusk Program sponsored a dis-
cussion where Jean-Claude Re-
naud, former Special Advisor to
the Secretary General of NATO
for Economic Policy Affairs, gave
a European’s perspective on the
current status of the Middle East.

Renaud explained how the
European view of the Middle East
differs from the United States view.
He said that the European nations
have closer ties with the Middle
East than the United States. For
example, he said, “in my country
alone, there are two to three mil-
lion citizens with Arabic roots.”
Consequently, Renaud said he
believes that European nations
must act with more caution and
must be more sensitive to action in
the Middle East.

Renaud also noted the simi-

larities in the views held by the
European nations and the US. Like
the United States, he said, Euro-
pean nations have established close
relations with several countries in
the Middle East. For example, he
compared the close US relation-
ship with Israel to the close French
relationship with Lebanon.

In addition, he noted that the
US, like Europe, depends heavily
on the Middle East as a source for
oil. But Renaud feels that both the
US and Europe will change their
policy concerning oil in the future
because, he said, “we should never
depend on one supplier.”

One student asked if Europe
and the US might turn to Russia as
a supplier for oil. Renaud stated
that several years\ago, the Euro-

peancommunity madea treaty with

the former Soviet Union which
was designed to maximize their oil
resources. As a result, Renaud

Davidson Graduates
Speak On the Myths of the Middle East

By Christopher Edwards

Last Sunday, Davidson gradu-
ates Sayres Rudy and Bilal El
Amine, Middle Eastern special-
ists, spoke about “Orientalism, Is-
lamism and Liberalism in the
Middle East,” in a forum organ-
ized by Wendy Dunn, Rami El
Amine and the Dean Rusk Pro-
gram.

Both Rudy and El Amine
emphasized the necessity of de-
stroying commonly held Euro-
American myths about Arabs and
the Middle East. Rudy, ’86,
stressed eliminating the stereotypes
associated with Orientalism, Is-
lamism, and liberalism.

Orientalism is the fallacious
belief that Middle Eastern trends
and problems are caused by Islam;

’ according to Rudy, blaming ter-

rorism and wars in the region solely
on Islam is as illogical as associat-
‘ing problems in Europe and Amer-
ica solely with Christianity,

He said that Islamism is “a
modern (seventy year old) twenti-
eth century revolutionary phe-
nomenon” arising from local con-
ditions in the Middle East, and that
it is neither medieval nor funda-
mentalist nor homogenous; con-
servative movements differ greatly
throughout the Arab world.

Liberalism is another idea that
many people in Europe and Amer-
ica can understand in relation to
the Middle East because, he said,
Middle Eastern countries have
made significant progress in the
development of their political and
social institutions in the thirty or so
years of their independence, com-
parable to the progress that Eng-
land made in the eight hundred
years from 1200 to the present.

El Amine, '87, spoke out
against more misconceptions about

the Middle East and suggested:

ways of changing them. He dis:
played two images of Arabs: one

believes that Russia will become a ~
major influence in the world’s oil
market, thus reducing the power of
countries in the Middle East.

Renaud also said that the re-
cent Gulf War was not as signifi-
cant in Europe as in the US. Al-
though several European countries
sent troops to the Middle East,
Renaud said that the United States
dominated the war to “the point of
the ridiculous.”

Renaud also said thatalthough
he felt every country was fighting
to secure the oil market, “Saddam
Hussein gave usa golden opportu-
nity to be a moralist.”

In summarizing, Renaud said
that any differences between the
US and European view of the
Middle Eastarise from “...a differ-
ence of approach...a difference of
the way we perceive the situation
in the Middle East.”

showing a bearded and turbaned
man and the other portraying an
Arab with skeletons as eyeballs.
According to El] Amine, if images
portraying other minority groups
in such a negative light were dis-
played, there would be a public
uproar.

He emphasized that Europe-
ans and Americans need to be-
come more sensitive to Arabs. For
example, he suggested that people
should stop seeing the Arab world
only in its conflict with Israel while
ignoring its more important prob-
lems. He also said that people
should realize that conflicts among
Arabs do not stem just from Islam
but rather fromi all sorts of causes.
Halting the characterizations of the
Middle East as a region that has,
unlike Eastern Europe, survived
the winds of change and moder-
nity, would also be profitable be-
cause, he said, the Middle East is
actually a modem region.
