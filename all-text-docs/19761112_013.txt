Fireman serves a worthy purpose

To the Editor:

From our greatest foolishness,
Comes the greatest wisdom.
From the world’d absurdity,

Comes our guiding light.

From one perspective, the return of
Fireman was one of the largest and
most ridiculously entertaining events
of the year. From another perspec-
tive, it was also one of the most
meaningful events. It is unfortunate
that few faculty and staff were on
hand to witness it, for they would
have seen one of the most pertinent
and complete presentations of the
needs of Davidson College ever given.
It was a forceful plea for educational
integrity.

First,.the most obvious character-
istic of the fireman phenomenon was
its _tremendous_ emotionality... Emot-
ional arousal and expression was the
name of the game. The amount of em-
otional expression is probably a good
indicator of the degree to which emot-
ionally is lacking in our education.
The fact that about 500 to 700 stu-
dents attended is a demonstration of
the epidemic effects too much sterile
‘‘learning’’ has on us. Emotional
interaction needs to be part of our
education.

Second, the expression of emotion
in the fireman phenomenon was
displaced expression. At the end of
the day when the events that have
triggered our anger and pleasures
have long been forgotten and our
energies have been reduced and
channelled into the superficial absorp-
tion of symbols from books, we
collectively discharge our chronically
held tensions in the direction of other
symbols, most of which have no

eminent meaning for us. We need to -

be able to express our feelings and
concerns at the time that they appear
in our educational process or at least
have opportunities for relevant and
appropriately directed discharges at
later times. We need to do it
collectively, that is, in groups of
various sizes.

Third, though the events depicted
along with fireman seemed to be
randomly chosen, they all had a
common focus. They were all symbols
of man’s irrational behavior. Hitler
and the fascist movement was an
extreme example of the tremendous
influence of the irrational. Indian
chants and dancing is another exam-
ple. Our own foolish taboos on
emotional expression and nudity were
chided in Krishna and Wolfman as
were the absurd stigmas on oddities
such as baldness. Perhaps the great-
est absurdity with a meaning for us
here and now is the failure of our
“teachers” to acknowledge and ser-
iously deal with the reality and power
that the irrational and repressed
unconscious has upon all of us, and
the wealth of knowledge that lies in it.
The symbol and keeper of that
repression were the books appropri-
ately burned on the steps of Belk. In
reality we do not burn our books.
Instead we force our noises into them,
ignore our own opinions and intui-
tional knowledge by ‘continually look-
ing for documentation from outside.
As a result, our own: understanding,
which goes unacknowledged, causes
us to burn inside. We become living
firemen. We must: learn through
experiencing each other and ourselves
as much as we do from books. We
need a whole—not a ‘half—education.

Fourth, the fireman phenomenon

parallels many aspects of our lives,
which on a wider is also a basic state
of mankind. First, as depicted, are
the symbols of irrational force in
Hitler, the Indian, Krishna and
others. Second, as enacted, the entire
student scene was itself a demonstra-
tion of emotional force and reality in
ourselves, as Manfred noted in last
week’s Davidsonian. Third, as lived,
is the irrationality of our education
without experience from which emo-
tions periodically burst undirected.
And fourth, on an existential level, we
are as most ‘‘educated’’ people,
caught between faith and knowledge.
Since the college has chosen know-

. ledge over faith, we are forced to

spend our spare time searching fran-
tically for faith or have it die in our
laps and lives. We need an education
which is also an integrated part of our
life.

Fifth, we seek contact with the
“real world’’, where action and emo-
tion are not ignored. The fire in the
dumpster after the fireman show was
over brought a bit of a symbol of that
world into our life when real firemen
came to put it out. We need not only
contact, but also participation in that
world. A group of students pushed
out of a dorm to have their picture
taken on the firetruck, and thus to
capture that brief moment when they
and something ‘‘real and relevant’”’
stood side by side. We need an
experiential education in an unbuf-
fered world where things we see and
do count for something concrete,
right then, rather than on a card at
the end of the term.

Finally, in the aftermath when the
next day comes, we find the scattered
residues of our frustrations. Piles of

burnt trash, broken pumpkins and

wet, papered halls lie silent. But it is
not we who find it—it is the janitors
who must face it. The ‘‘educators”’ are
not content to place all value on
academics. They (and we) must also
devalue the manual. This summer,
after the janitors had cleaned up the
union once, its basement was reno-
vated and repainted, only to have
them clean it up again. We pay them
less than substantial wages while
squandering our own mostly un-
earned fortunes on lavish housing,
life-style, liquor and leisure. This is
like spitting in the face of your
pseudo-opponent while you hold him
down, though it has been sufficiently
removed from our presence and
intellectualized to be ignored in
actuality. Action has become a nega-
tive value. It is punished by academic
sacrifice. Ironically, and yet appro-
priately, the mess left by the fireman
phenomenon is cleaned up by these
people. Those who, we degrade attitu-
dinally and physically (financially)
are the ones who must pick up the
pieces of our educational inadequacy.
Soon, after Davidson, what is now
only our educational separation will
become the sin of self-separation
manifest in the inadequacy and
drudgery of our daily and total lives.

Fireman is not dead but continues
to burn on in the hearts and minds of
those who feel the incompleteness of
Davidson. An incompleteness which
is also its oppression. He will remain
and return in many forms until the
‘‘teachers’’, whatever their names
become, learn what learning is all

bout.
