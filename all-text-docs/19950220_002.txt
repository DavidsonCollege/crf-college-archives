Solidarity Week

Students and faculty discuss affirmative action in panel

By MATTHEW EirIcH
Assistant News Editor

Tuesday evening there was a
panel discussion on affirmative
action in the 900 Room. The panel
consisted of students Latasha
Jenkins and Bill Gullan, Philoso-
phy Department Chair Dr. Lance
Stell, and Assistant to the Director
of Career Services Tony Perez.
The discussion began with each
panelist giving an opening state-
ment; then, the panel fielded ques-
tions from the small audience.

Gullan was the first to give an
Opening statement, which was char-
acterized by emphasis on the indi-
vidual rather than groups. Gullan
defined affirmative action as “any
institutional attempt to make up
for discrimination in history.” He
said, “Affirmative action is an at-
tempt to make up for history.”

Gullan says the claim that all
minorities deserve preferential
treatment regardless of socioeco-
nomic status is inconsistent: “Poor

whites are not seen as the objects
of discrimination that affluent
blacks are.” Rather than creating
equality through affirmative ac-
tion, he says, “It’s time to help the
less fortunate, regardless of the
race block on an application.”

Perez jumped in next, begin-
ning his statement by saying that in
an ideal world, he would not sup-
port affirmative action but minori-
ties would help themselves by
building their own communities
from within.

But since this is not a perfect

* world, Perez believes “affirmative

actionis very necessary.” He sights
institutional obstacles in the busi-
ness world, such as the view that
minorities are inferior and the “old
boy network,” as stumbling blocks
impeding minorities’ progress.
For Perez, affirmative action
is a necessary evil: “Until institu-
tions begin to police themselves,
the governmentis obliged to doit.”
Jenkins spoke next and de-
fined affirmative action as “the

ability of companies to actively
pursue increased diversity.” She
also asked the question, “Does
the end justify the means?” and
answered by saying affirmative
action is justified because it in-
creases diversity, which is
“good.” Of diversity, Jenkins
said, “Everyone has something
to bring to the table.”

Jenkins also asked, “Why is
affirmative action an issue?”
Jenkins said Americans are at-
tacking affirmative action now
because the economy is bad. A
weak job market activates inse-
curities among the natural oppo-
nents of affirmative’action.

Stell began his opening state-
ment with a brief history of affir-
mative action and its goals. He
said the goals were to ensure vot-
ing rights and equal access to
accommodations, to provide
equal access to schools and job
opportunities, and to make repa-
rations for historical. injustices.
Stell said he “fully supported”

the original goal of affirmative
action, which was a “colorblind
society.”

Stell believes that affirma-
tive action has moved too far be-
yond those original goals: “Af-
firmative action has not become a
dream, but a nightmare.” He said
that in the current political cli-
mate, a “regime” has been cre-
ated which solely monitors race.

The “background premise”
of affirmative action, according
to Stell, is that “racial minorities
need help.” This premise serves
to “undermine the achievements”
of minorities because affirmative
action provides a “rationale to
depreciate achievement.”

“How to give aid without
bruising pride” is the issue to
address, according to Stell.

During the question and an-
swer session, the scope of discus-
sion was widened, and the panel-
ists explained more fully their
arguments on the subject.

Perez indicted the Davidson

——

administration for the lack of mi-
nority professors and administra-
tors. Perez asked the rhetorical ques-
tion, “‘Why has Davidson in its 150
year history only recently tenured
its first black professor?” He said
the administration did not try to cre-
ate an adequate level of “comfort”
for minority professors so much so
that many do not want to stay. Perez
said, “No, they’ re not trying [to hire
and retain minority professors and
administrators]; They’ re not.”

Stell said that Davidson wants
to hire minority professors and ad-
ministrators, but they cannot attract
them.

When the philosophy depart-
ment had a vacancy to fill, none of
the 300 applicants was a minority.
“Davidson cannot compete for black

‘philosophy professors,” Stell said.

About the role minorities must
have in creating this atmosphere,
Perez said, “Not enough are sacri-
ficing, not enough are making the
first step. If everyone puts their best
effort in ... we will put things right.”

AIDS activist speaks

By Mary CLare JALONICK

UNC Charlotte psychology
professor Bob Barrett and AIDS
patient Roy Shelton spoke to a

. small crowd of Davidson students

Thursday about the effects of the
deadly disease and its impacts on
the homosexual community.
Barrett, who has been work-
ing with AIDS patients since 1984,
said that “if people on this cam-
pus came to understand AIDS, it

. might change the way they act

sexually. [Safe sex] is a pain, and

‘it’s going to be a pain, but we

have to learn to deal with it.”
Barrett also spoke about how
he came to understand the dis-
ease by discovering his own sexu-
ality. Through his work with
AIDS, he realized that he was gay
and left his family to focus on
helping the homosexual commu-
nity cope with the horrors of HIV.
When Barrett’s daughter was
a student at Davidson 10 years
ago, he held the first public AIDS
forum in Mecklenburg County in

the 900 Room. At that point, only a
few cases of AIDS existed in the
Charlotte area; now there are more
than 600. “These are the easy days,”
says Barrett. “It’s a matter of time
before everyone knows someone
affected by the virus.”

AIDS patient Roy Shelton also
spoke to the group. “AIDS has
made me realize how valuable he
world is and how important rela-
tionships are,” he says. ““We don’t
need to stress out about our futures;
we need to appretiate the moment
—because that’s all we really have.”

ward him. “He was walking to-
ward me with a big brown rifle,”
he says. Reeves is an experienced
hunter familiar with guns, so he

. “knew immediately it was an M-1 _

rifle.” His initial thought was that
» the man walking toward him was a
member of ROTC since they often

' carry M-1s when performing drills.
But Reeves also knew that ROTC

_ M-Isare painted white, so he was
aware that something was not right,
Reeves began to piece things

together: “It happened so quickly. ~
' [ remembered what the guy. had ~

said at the top of the street.” When
they came nearer, Reeves looked
~, into the eyes of the gunmen. “He

"had these eyes, these really hor-

» rible looking eyes.”

Reeves slammed on the brakes
of his bike and slid from the right to
the left side of the street. He aban-
doned his bike and began running
when he heard the first shot. As he
ran into an alley, Reeves heard
four more shots behind him.

Reeves was able to hide be-
hind a large electrical unit in the
alley. As he hid, “I could hear the
guy walking up the street and re-
loading.”

Reeves thinks the gunman then
walked up to the entrance of the
alley and started shooting up

_ Franklin Street; which is perpen-

dicular to the street Reeves first
saw the gunman on. When Reeves
heard the gunmen reload, he

_ weaved in between four or five

cars parked in the alley before the
gunman began shooting again.
Reeves saw a group of Phi Nu
sorority members on the balcony
of their house and called up to
them to get inside, hoping he could
also, But they ran into the house
before he could join them and was

still left in the alley. He next ran
behind a dumpster, and a car
pulled up with two men inside.
When they learned what was go-
ing on, they got out of their’car
and behind the dumpster with
Reeves. Reeves began to regain
his composure with other people
around, but the two men soon ran
off, leaving him alone again.

Finally, aman about 40 years
old returned to his office whose
backdoor was in the alley. He
saw Reeves and let him in; from -
the office the two watched the
remainder of the saga unfold.

After a UNC senior tackled
the gunman, Reeves returned to
the street as if nothing had hap-
pened. His first thought was that
he had better go to his 3:00 lab.
“Nothing had sunk in,” he says,

About 20 minutes into lab,
the immensity of the events that
afternoon finally began to dawn
onhim. He excused himself from
lab. “I was just thinking, ‘Ishould
be dead right now.’”
