Stress can be beaten

“Dear Confidential Health:

I am a junior and until this
term I always felt that I handled
the stress of coursework and ex-
tracurricular activities well. This
year I feel so pressured. Several of
my friends are in the same ac-
tivities and courses that I’m in and
they don’t seem to have any prob-
lem coping. Can you suggest
‘some ways that I can deal with
stress?”

Dear Junior:

Stress is very individualized.
What is stressful to you won’t be
stressful to’ someone else, and we
all have different ways of dealing
with stress. The following are
some suggestions that. you might
find helpful.

‘Manage. yourself. Don’t let
the demands of coursework, so-
cial events, friends, work, and so
on, manage you. You can gain
control by setting priorities and by
realizing there are limits to what
you can accomplish every day.
Use a date book to get a realistic
idea of when upcoming projects
are due. Budget your time so that
you can complete your work with-
out having to push at the last mi-
nute. By procrastinating you’ll
only end up increasing your anxi-
ety when deadlines. come up.

_ ‘Be realistic. If events really
seem to be unmanagable, consider

_

CONTEST: write a caption for

dropping out of a few activities, or
re-evaluating your expectations.

Maybe you can’t make all A’s and

be actively involved in other eve-
nts this term.

‘Take care of you body. Exer-
cise will relieve your tensions,
help you relax, and-give you
energy to do the things you want
tadh es

‘Eat a balanced diet and get

plenty of sleep. Give your body
time to rest and rejuvenate. Don’t
try to reduce your stress by taking
alcohol or drugs. You'll be creat-
ing many more anxieties than

you’ll ever relieve. ©

‘Take time out for yourself.
Reserve time to reward yourself
for your hard work. Listen to your
favorite album, take a bubble
bath, or’go to a movie you’ve
wanted to see. Be indulgent.

‘Don’t suffer in silence. If you
can’t reduce your stress,m contact
an objective person who can help
you.

On campus, contact the Stu-
dent Counseling Center iun the
basement of the Union. Don’t
stand by and wait for things to get
better.

MecLads

By ASH ASHANUDDIN
GLENN FOGLE
and JOHN HARRIS

Since the end of the term is
rapidly approaching and every-
body has those nasty term papers
due, the MacLads thought you
freshmints and other clueless

‘I was scaring women on 3rd
Cannon with a “Jason” mask.

‘I left my quotes in my library
books.

‘It exploded. s--- happens...

‘I was seeing if I could find
any girl who’s been to the Sig Ep
house.
__‘“I dropped the ball.”

~ Davidson students could use a few

suggestions to explain to your pro-
fessors why your term papers are’
late. (That is, of course, if they
are). These can be used at any

. time in the term of course, but

now is the time when they will re-
ally come in handy. When your
professor asks you why you don’t
have your paper, respond:

Men:

‘What paper?

‘I didn’t have enough time, I
was stair-diving for my physics
project.

“I was trapped at Queens.

“We were busy writing an
apology to the bovines.
““[ passed out at the Squid
house. me

Women:

‘I was literally paralyzed with
laughter when I read the “Spoof of
the Week” column.

“What paper?

-I was writing a letter to The
Davidsonian complaining about
the MacLads.

‘I was grazing with those Rus-
kies.

‘I don’t know. (Then, if you
want, start crying).

Time ripe for term paper excuses

‘I just couldn’t do it because I
was slaving over the crossword
puzzle in last week’s Davidso-
nian.

-The SPEs wouldn’t let me out
of their house.

-I was dreaming about Bob the
Carrot.

Question of the week:

Why did eight policemen have
six unidentified youths spread-
eagled on Warner Hall's back
porch in the wee hours of last Sun-
day morning?

A. They were selling tickets to
the policeman’s ball.

B. They had nothing better to
do. ~-

C. They were looking for the
MacLads. .

D. They were pretending they
were Clint Eastwood.

E. None of the above.

Next week: the MacLads give
tips on Halloween safety.
