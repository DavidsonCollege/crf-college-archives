Wipe that slate at Furman clean.

500 Wildcat boosters will be pulling for
you in the Columbia game.

Make Wake Forest number four and
Furman number five on the credit side
of the ledger.

For the first time since the “one man”
was old enough to prognosticate the
why’s and wherefore’s of the football
season he admits that Davidson will have
a look in on the State championship.
Congratulations Bailey, you're waking
up.

dog rooters pulled Saturday. You have

The Trinity menace has faded away,

State has only scored two touchdowns
in three games, one on a fumble, the
other on an intercepted pass. On the
other hand the Wolf-pack looks mighty
good on the defense.

Elon, P. C,, V. P. IL. and Citadel—and
not a score from scrimmage against the

clean, Wildcats. Show Wake Forest and
Furman your claws.

There may be plenty of stumps in
Wake Forest but Coach Monk’s ma-

they say, is mighty hard on stumps.

DOPE BOX REARRANGED

Comparative Scores Indicate Six
Hard Games to Finish

With the dust having settled over the
gridiron battlegrounds of last week it is
possible to draw a few conclusions, some of
them vague, others more definite. When the
season first began and after the first reports
had come in over the wires it appeared that
there were to be five outstanding contend-
ers for state championship honors. Review-
ing the results of the games played so far
this season it appears that this number has
dwindled down to three—State, Carolina and
Davidson. With the game today between
Carolina and State one of these two will be
eliminated.

Wake Forest, Trinity, State, Carolina and
Davidson seemed to have strong teams when
the season first opened, but reports and facts
seem to reverse this statement as regards
same. Wake Forest and Trinity have both
suffered defeats at the hands of Carolina,
while the other three have not yet felt the
pangs of defeat at the hands of a North
Carolina aggregation.

Merely because Davidson appears in the
first bracket does not indicate that she is to
have an easy time with her future games.
All of the above are yet to be met by the
Wildcats, and though Trinity and Wake
Forest are out of the running for champion-
ship honors, they or State or Carolina may
subtract a notch f¥om the Wildcats growing
fame.

Uppermost in the minds of the Davidson
squad and the student body in the coming
game with Wake Forest in Charlotte Sat-
urday. Minus the services of Heckman and
one or: two other good players, the Baptists
are not making the stides they did last year,
but it has always been a known fact that
when the Baptists and Presbyterions lock
horns luck generally favors the former.
Wake Forest overwhelmingly defeated
Guilford and came out by a good margin
over Lynchburg College last week, but fell
under the onslaught of the Carolina aggre-
gation, 22 to 0. The defeat meted out to
the Baptists by the Carolina eleven was early
in the season and it may be that they have
added strength to their squad in the mean-
time. Davidson defeated Elon, 19-0, who in
turn won by the narrow margin of 3 to 0
over Lynchburg, and the latter suffered de-

feat last week, 25 to 0, at the hands of the

S GAME

AFTER MANY DISTURBANCES

Baptists. This would indicate that the Wild-
cats have a hard game ahead of them with
this opponent, but they will claw and. scratch
their way through, remembering the dis-
heartening game of last year.

Following the Wake Forest contest the
Wildcats journey to the Sandlapper State,
where they will meet Furman at Columbia,
Wednesday, October 14. This game follow-
ing in four days after the Baptist-Presby-
terian scrap is going to be hard on the Wild-
cats. On top of this, Furman has a strong
team, having won two victories and met de-
feat once. She defeated Virginia, 13 to 10,
was beaten by Mercer, 6 to 3, and trompled
over P. C. for three touchdowns, the final
score being 20 to 0. Davidson was a winner
by three points over P. C., and if compara-
tive scores mean anything, Davidson is go-
ing to meet a formidable opponent at Col-
umbia. Furman nosed out Davidson last
year, 13 to 10, and this season finds both
teams in better condition and stronger by
far than in 1922,

Comparative scores tell the tale that Dav-
idson and State are evenly matched. Dav-
idson beat P. C. 3 to 0, South Carolina lost
a hard fight to P. C., 7 to 3, and last week
State scored a lone touchdown against South
Carolina. The outcome of the State-Caro-
lina fracas today is being watched with con-
siderable interest on the Hill, and when the
fighting Wildcats meet State in Charlotte,
Saturday, November 3, they will in all prob-
ability have five hundred more Wildcats
pulling for them.

Even more formidable than Furman is
the, Clemson eleven, with which Davidson
clashes at Clemson, Saturday, November 10.
Even though neither of these games count in
the state contest for honors, it would be a
great victory to win out in both, The Clem-
son Tigers held the strong Auburn team to a
0-0 tie, swamped Newberry 32 to 0, and last
week staged a great game against Centre,

IN FAVOR
THIS FALL

Short,threebutton,
half-belted ulsters
are to be greatly
favored this fall.
You’ll see many
of them; but none
like the Society
Brand Hampton.

The difference is in
the cut. There’s an air
about this overcoat that
you will find nowhere
else; it’s smartly cut;
every detail—the roll of
the lapel, the spacing of
the buttons, the placing
of the pockets-is exactly
right.

We havea wonderful
assortmentof fabrics for
your selection. Hea-
ther mixtures, colorful
overplaids—whatever
you like, we have it.
