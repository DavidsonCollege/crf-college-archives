Lampton Reflects Views
Held By Angry Young Men

By PRESTON FAGGART
Fine Arts Department

What was England in those ancient,
pre-mod, pre-rocker days like? What
went on over there BB (before Bea-
tles)?

Time is flapping by so fast these
days that the decade of the 50’s is al-
ready past history, in a way, as re-
mote and meaningless as the dark
ages of, say, the 6th century A D.

This state of affairs is perhaps the
result of two literary movements that
flowered briefly during that remote
decade: the so-called Angry Young
men in England and the Beat Genera-
tion here in the good old U.S.A. Both
movements seemed to have insisted,
paraphrasing Shakespeare, “Live no
more; the bomb has murdered life.”
And the Angry Young Men apparent-
ly have all, like Room At The Top’‘s
hero, Joe Lampton, burrowed their
way down to that room, squirmed into
that comfortable three guinea shirt,
Sulka bathrobe, Leddersford Conserv-
ative Club society they were clammer-
ing against (and for).

WRITER'S LOW-DOWN

It will be interesting to hear Mr.
John Braine, author of Room At The
Top, here at Davidson next week, not
because. we will be given any in-
sights into his masterwork: it is self-
explaining, self-destroying even, but
to get the writer's low-down on the
current happenings in merrie England
as he -sees it.

Joe, with natural assets of good
looks and a likable disposition, comes
from a provincial, working class back-
ground but has pushed himself up to
the level of junior accountant as he
begins telling his story. ;

Warley, a prosperous milltown in
Yorkshire to which Joe has just moved
is quite a different scene from his na-
tive Dufton . . . “dead Dufton, dirty
Dufton.... Here in Warley he finds
excitement, opportunity, and culture,
plus a society alive enough to feed his
ambitions. He joins the local drama
group for the sociability in it and im-
mediately gets involved with two wom-
en.

Alice Aisgill, unhappily married,
nine. years his senior, experienced, is
just what the hungry young man

needs. He falls deeply in love with her.
PEACHES AND CREAM

The other woman is a girl: 19,
peaches and cream. Susan is the lus-
cious, ripe, virginial daughter of mill-
owner Brown (worth about 100,000
pounds.) Who could resist?

Riding high on his huge success
Joe can gloat over his envious compan-

ions
“| WANTED HER .. .”

“Whatever desires they had been
tormented by, I'd fulfilled . . . I was
given for the asking what they'd never
get in a thousand years; and I'd be
given Susan, too; and, if I wanted her,
there was no reason why I shouldn't
be given June.”

But in the next scene we find old
Joe taking a step backward. He discov-
ers that Alice, forced by circumstances
during the lean years of World War Il,
had.modeled nude for a painting which
was on view in a nearby town’s munic-
ipal gallery. This is too much. He is
crushed and slashes out in fury only

LIKE LIGHTNING

But soon they're back happy again
—and Susan too. If Alice is a juicy
roastbeef dinner, Susan is a delicious,
creamy dessert.

In spite of the efforts of Big Daddy
Brown to break things up, Joe makes
rapid progress and the irony flashes
like lightning: Susan is with child and
Joe’s going to be welcomed into the
family. The swineherd will marry the
princess . . . the swineherd will be
given a top job for the kind, if—so,
Joe’s off to Alice to say goodbye. For-
ever.

Alice takes it very well: she crash-
es her Fiat into a stone wall and dies
a hideous slow death.

BRILLIANT WRITING

A brilliant piece of writing ends
the story: Joe does. what most young
men would when he learns the next
day of his mistress's death. He goes on
a hellish bender in a near-by town try-
ing to wash away Alice’s agonizing
moans with. drink, sex, and violence.
But he still knows the score and he
wishes he didn’t.

The book is brilliant. It rings of
irony and truth found in the books of
Sam Butler and Evelyn Waugh. And
amazingly enough it is a first novel
for Braine.

FRATERNITIES ??

Faculty Opinion Differs'

By BOB STRAU SER
Davidsonian Feature Editor
One interesting aspect of the

current Fraternity dialogue has
been faculty reaction, express-
ed both publicly and privately.
Since a large percentage of the
faculty and administration are
alumni of Davidson, it is hard-
ly surprising to find a concern
in that body with the issues
discussed this week. ;

Dr. John Kelton and Dr. W.
G. Workman, present at the
Wednesday evening forum,
on the issue, voiced their atti-
tude publicly. Curiously per-
haps, the latter revealed ap-

proval of aht national fra-
ternity system (as opposed
to local eating clubs) on

the grounds that it was the best
control system possible.
“Almost invariably (recalling
one exception) when we ask a
national to discipline a local

ROTC-IFC Blood Drive
Set To Begin Nov. 30

The ROTC-IFC blood drive
will be held Nov. 30 and Dec. 1.
Donors will report to the college
gymnasium between 11 a. m.
and 5 p. m. on either day.

day. Dec. 1. The Red Cross fur-
nishes an added incentive by
providing that anyone involved

in an accident within six
months ‘of his donation will re-
ceive free blood.

The IFC awards a plaque to
the fraternity contributing the
most blood. Of the sixteen times
this. plaque has been given, the

Sigma Nus have won it ten

times.

The last drive, held last April,
nntted 264 pints of blood. This
figure, low for a student body
comparable in size to Davidson.
should be surpassed this time.

Each contributor gives one
pint of blood unless for medical
reasons he is unable’ to donate
that much. According to Dr
J. B. Woods. college physician
the average body will replace
this amount of blood in approxi-
mately one week.

All blood donated goes to the

took many films and pictures

Steve Bunch, president of the
Student Union stated this was
the first. time anything like
his has ever come to Davidson.
He said there has been many
requests for a program of this
nature and felt that it was of
general interest to iust about
anyone.

er Dave, Young, and drummer
Tim Smith is currently touring

chapter, they do. it,” noted
Workman, who serves on the
faculty fraternity committee.

In a different vein and some-
what more philosophical, Dr.
Kelton stated that the only le-
gitimate purpose of fraterni-
tis on this campus would be to
foster fellowship and allow stu-
dents to come in close contact
with other diverse’ personali-
ties.

NOT A DEATH BLOW

From this viewpoint, the is-
sue of 100 per cent bidding did
not appear a death blow to the
system to either Kelton or As-
sistant Dean of Students Bob
Jones. Both cited psychological
studies to advance this view.

Later, Dr. Workman noted
that he “was not impressed”
with a proposal submitted by
Fred Sackett to fill the social
gap with two local fraternities.
Workman pointed out that the
only thing held in common by
those people who would con-
stitute these fraternities is their
common rejection by the sys-
tem.

After Rick von Unwerth's
Tuesday chapter address, some
talk circulated (‘off the record”
for the most part) among facul-
ty-members about “irresponsi-
bility” and “avoiding the real
issue,”

This question was placed be-
fore a much respected faculty
member; the informal discus-
sion that followed seems to be
indicative of some faculty opif-
ion.

“Of course I am more _in-
fluenced. by the speaker with
whom I agree.” said the pro-

fessor (an alumnus). “I don’t .

think Rick was avoiding any-
thing, although he did seem to
be looking for a rationale for
the system.”

Dr. George Abernethy was
frank and quite willing to dis-
cuss the matter but declined
specific reaction, having missed
Monday chape) and Open End.

He did note that the frater-
nity system would not be open
to question “. . . if it furthered
the objectives of the institution

100 PER CENT BIDDING

One alumnus on the faculty
a former member of the faculty
Fraternity Committee, noted
that “. with the higher
quality of boys being admitted
to Davidson, I don’t see why
any fraternity should object to
some form of 100 per cent bid-
ding.”

Dr. W. O. Puckett, on the
other hand, felt that his pre-
med students indicate another
trend bearing on the system.
“Those with the grades,” he
said, “are not well rounded; and
those who are well rounded
socially do not have the grades.”

While it would be a mistake
to state that the faculty uni-
versally feels that some change
is necessary in the present sys-
tem, a majority seems to lean
in that direction.

It was implied by several and
said openly by one faculty mem-
ber questioned. “This thing
won’t end this week; there is
sentiment for change and one
would be naive to dismiss it.”
“Dr. W. 0. Puckett felt we
should be asking what role fra-
ternities are to play on campus.
He lamented the present situa-
tion as having “too much social
and not enough intellectual’
emphasis.

Even further, he noted that
at Davidson the primary alle-
giance seemed to be to the
fraternity and not to the school.
For this. reason he advocated
Sophomore rush (“Any fresh-
man class would do well to be

together for a year., . ”) From
his experience with Princeton
eating clubs, he felt definitely
than 100 per cent ‘bidding would -
not work.

NO ALTERNATIVE

Interestingly, Puckett elabo-
rated on the lack of an alter-
native to fraternities here. At.
Princeton, he said, the advent of {
the “college system” has led:
‘to the recent demise of some -
eating clubs—“but what is the |
Davidson alternative?”

In stating his belief that
“some change is necessary,”
Chaplain Will Terry felt strong- ‘
ly that “the fraternities and the
faculty must remain flexible,
enough to try something. If an
innovation doesn't work,” he
continued, “We should not be
afraid to scrap it and start over
again.”

NATIONAL TREND

Bill Bondurant said that, de-
spite any other possible quali-
fications, “Any year is high -
time to take a close look at the
system here at Davidson.” The
current questioning, he said, is
part of a national trend which
was going to get here sooner -
or later ani is not without its
possibility for betterment.

While it would be a mistake
to state that the members: of .
the faculty and administration
who were questioned constitute
a random sample, the feeling
does seem dominant that some
change is necessary.

It was implied by several and :
said openly by one faculty mem- |
ber questioned. ‘This thing !
won’t end this week; there is
sentiment for change and one
would be naive to dismiss it.” |
