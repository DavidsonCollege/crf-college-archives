The Davidsontan

Dedicated Professor Speaks Chinese

If Gil Holland, Professor of
English,
you some morning, just say
“Fine, thanks.”

For the past two years Hol-
land has been studying Chinese.
first from tapes in the language
lab and last summer at Stan-
ford University.

“Chinese has a long heritage
of culture behind it—thousands
of years of poems and prose, as
well as being the world’s most
spoken language,” Holland says.
He recommends that ‘‘Everyone

says ‘‘Ni-Hao-Ma?” to

ought to at least try it. They

have everything to gain and

nothing to lose.”

He did emphasize, though.
that in order to learn Chinese
the student must be dedicated.
The most demanding phase is
at the beginning where about
ten hours a week for three to
four weeks are recommended in
order to master the fundamen
tals.

However, he feels that the
time spent is well worth it. ‘It
takes the measure of a man—a

‘ot of discipline, but intellectu-
ally I don't think you will be dis-
appo:nted.”

Grammatically Chinese is sim-
ilar to western languages. Writ-
ten Chinese is composed of char-
acters which represent entire
words or in some cases paris of
words. No two characters are
exactly alike. Each character is
formed as a variation on one of
214 radicals (which is the clos-
est thing Chinese has to an al-
phabet.)

is one striking differ.

ence between Chinese and Eng-
lish grammar. A Chinese sen-
tence need have only a verb, a
subject is not required.

Though Holland does not see
the grammar as especially dif
ficul:, Chinese characters are
“another matter’. They require
‘a great deal of memory work.”

Holland said that a first year
student in Stanford’s Chinese
program must be able to form
at least 600 characters in o.der
to pass. It requires a knowledge
of over 3500 to read a newspa-
per from Taiwan.

A student might also encoun-
ter difficulty in learning to cor-
relate the spoken word with the
appropriate character. Chinese
is a tcnal language, meaning
that words are distinguished by
various tones. Since this prob-
lem is not encountered in west
ern languages, the student must
learn new speech patterns.

“Learning Chinese would defi-
citely make an excellent inde-
pendent study program,” said
Holland. “‘The more you get into
Chinese the more you fall in
love with it.” He feels that a
person choosing to learn Chi-
aese under the independent
study program would “have to

work hard but would get some-
thing out of it.” He also stated
that ‘‘Davidson’s language facil-
ities are excellent, much better
than those at Stanford.”

A complete set of introductory
tapes for speaking and writing,
and the manuals that ¢ with
them have been available in the
language lab for over a year.
Also in the lab are tapes for Hin-
di-Urdu, Sanskrit, Po:tuguese,
Russ:an, Japanese and Italian.
Like the Chinese tapes they
have seldom been used.

National Student Lobby Fights

For Collegians In Congress

By TODD EADES
Contributing Editor

The National Student Lobby
(NLS) is the only naticnal stu-
dent organization which is al-
lowed to lobby in Congress in
behalf of student interests. Its
objecives aie to fight for stu-
dent interests in Washington, to
provide mformation for studen‘s,
to individually communicate
with their representatives, and
to help foster state and local
lobbies.

Itself an outgrowth of the Cal-
ifornia Student Lobby and the
Colorado Student Lobby, the
NSL was begun in October.
1971 and in January, 1972, had
82 member schools in 36 states
representing 460,000 students.

A permanent organization, NSL
is a non-profit registered lobby.
It has a permanent staff and
offices in Washington, D. C., te
monitor the activities of Con-
gress and the Executive, and to
make the needs and interests of

Ry

students known throughout the
government.

The NSL does not endorse any
card.date, but takes pos:tions on
issues and seeks to affect gov-
ernment policies related to
those issues.

Positions on issues are adopt
ed through an annual ballot sent
to each member's student gov
ernment. The issue will usually
be put before the student body
in a referendum. The results of
this referendum from all mem-
ber schools determine the poli-
cies of the NSL.

When this referendum cannot
be scheduled to correspond with
regular student government elec-
tions, NSL allows the student
council to cast a number of
votes proportional to the num-
ber of students. This provision
is mainly for the mammoth uni-
versities, and perhaps Davidson
could always use the referer
dum if it joins NSL.

When NSL_ becomes large

enough it will divide into re-
gional caucuses for communica.
tion and organization purposes.

NSL_ believes that financial
support by students, in place of
non-student sources, is essential.
For the first year membership
fees are scheduled to corte.
spcnd roughly with the number
of students. Davidson's fee would
be $40. In succeeding years fees
will be proportional to the num-
ber of students at that school.
and will be set at a level de
termined by the membership.

At the March 14 Senate meet
ing former SGA President Dan-
ny Clodfelter brought the mat-
ter of membership in NSL to
the Senate’s attention. The Sen-
ate has asked Peter Coye, one
of NSL’s original organizers, to
meet with the Senate concern
ing membership.

Clodfelter believes Davidson
should join NSL. ‘It’s had a rec-
ord of success. As a side bene-
fit tne referenda would stimu-
late discuzsion of issues.”
