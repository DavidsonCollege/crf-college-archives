The Davidson ‘Venn team, composed |
ot Crawterd and . Johnson, are again vie
tors in intercollegi: ite tennis.  Lhis time
the victiny was ilon College.

The Davidson team, arnving at len
a dittle late, was roshed immediately to
the, ‘tennis court. “Vhe match opened
with lon copping game after game on
the first set. Davidson, however, soon
became accustomed to the new ‘court,

fedeven straight) games, winning the
taatch in straight sets, 0-4, 0-0, 6-1,

Vhe feature of the match was. the
Lhard smashing game waged — by both
Crawford and Johnson. Rushing quick-
ly to the net after cach serve, they met
each return with a hard smash, com-
pletely disconcerting Elon’s team.

Davidson wil play Guilford nexi at
Guilford, and ‘Trinity and Carolina, on
her home court, probably in the Spring.
