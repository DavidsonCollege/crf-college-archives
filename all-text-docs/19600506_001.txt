Decisive Faculty Vote Doems
Freshman Rush And Initiation

Faculty Soph Rush RulingF
Takes Many By Surprise

“Jt shocked me,” said Dr. C. J. Pietenpol,
mittee, regarding Tuesday's action by

pledging, and initiation.

In interviews with several
members of the faculty and stu-
‘dent body THE DAVIDSONIAN
found this to be the common
reaction. Jerry Cole, newly-
elected president of the Inter-
fraternity Council, expressed
general student surprise that
“the issue was brought up

Dr. W. F. Goodykeontz point-
ed out, however, that “the mo-
tion for sophomore rush was
not ‘sprung’ on the faculty or

has been debated for months
‘among fraternity men, indepen-
dents and faculty members. The

the question.”

President D. Grier Martin
made jt clear that “the faculty
has the right and responsibility
to intervene in any student af-
fairs. The fraternity system has
been a faculty matter since it
was established here.”

Dr. Goodykoontz praised the
faculty for “showing the cour-
age of their convictions last
Tuesday.” 4

Next year's Student Council
President Henry Shue saw his
council's job as “coordinating
the activities of the IFC, the
IMAC, the Freshman Council,
the YMCA, the Union, and oth-
ers in preparing for the change-
over to the new system.”

Said Cole regarding the task

HOMECOMING DATE CHANGED

LF C Sets Rush Date,
Adds Two Regulations

At its Monday mght meeting the Interfraternity
Council voted to have Rush Week begin on Monday, Sep-
tember 12 and continue through Friday, September 16.

As in past years there will be
three one-hour parties each
night during Rush Week lasting
from 7:00 p.m. until 10:00 p.m.
All freshmen must be back in
their dormitories by 10:15 p.m.

The IFC did not set a date
as to when upperclassmen can
return to the campus next
fetl, but the council did vote
that no upperclassmen except
hall counsetors and freshmen
advisors shall enter the fresh-
man dormitories before 8:00
a.m. on September 10.

The Interfraternity Council
made two additions to the Rush
Week regulations. To prevent
one fraternity from monopoliz-
ing a freshman’s room during
dorm rushing hours, the council
decided to have a gentleman's
agreement that no one fratern-
ity can occupy a freshman’s
room ‘for more than fifteen min-
utes at any one time.

The IFC also passed a regula:
tion saying that no upperciass-
men, except for those on the
camp staff, shall attend the
freshman camp.

On Thursday, April 28, the
Interfraternity Council met
with the Faculty-Praternity
Committee to diseuss the prob-
lem of fraternity hazing. Dr.
Clarence J. Pletenpol, chair-
men of the committee, asked
the (FC to teke steps which
will help to reduce fraternity
hazing.

At the Monday night meeting
the council drew up a report
which was given to Dr. Pieten-
pol to be presented to the fac-
ulty. In the report the IFC stat-
ed that it plans to have Greek
Week the first or second week
in the second semester.

» This action was taken because
the council feels that most pre-
initiation hazing occurs immedi-
ately following exams and there-

faculty forbidding freshman rushing,

a service organization, desiring
to fulfill the intent of the fra-
ternities. If fraternities are as
much opposed to sophomore
rush as they appear at present,
the way to give their opposition
influence is through appeals to
the faculty, and through mak-
ing next year a model fraternity
year.”

He continued, “The faculty
has not made known to the IFC
what regulations it expects us
to set up in regard to 1961 soph-
omore rush, but when the oc-
casion arises the IFC will do all

within its power to make the

new system as attractive to the
fraternities as possible.”

CHANNELS OPEN

Dr. Martin, while citing the
faculty vote as decisive, stated:
“All channels are open from
students to faculty on the issue.
The matter could be brought up
again. It might be most effec-
tive if, next year, fraternities
try to work out ways of meet-
ing objections to the present
system.”

Dr. Pietenpol commented on
the original committee report
which was upset by the faculty
vote. “Many of us on the com-
mittee at first felt inclined to
sophomore rush. But data we
collected led us to believe
unanimously that sophomore
rush was inadvisable.”

Dr. W. G. McGavock, also on
the Fraternity Committee and
former chairman, said concern-
ing the recommendation, “On
the basis of study we were not
sure that a change would bring
sufficient good to warrant all
the changes necessary. But I will
do all I can to implement the
faculty decision. I believe there
is a good chance that sopho-
toore rush will work.”

Student Council President Henry Shue plen several changes in
the program of next year’s Court of Control.

Bootle Heads Court,
Requests Student Aid

Bill Shinn will serve as Re-
corder, while Seniors Tom Par-
ker and Claude Finney, Juniors
Clay Atkins and Cecil Holcomb,
and Sophomores Joe Angsley
and Jim Hendrix complete the
membership of the court.

As a result of the April 25
ruling of the Student Coun-
cil, the Court’s period of ex-
Istence was shortened to end
within the week of Homecom-
ing. Friday chapels were ollm-
inated except for a reading of
a lst of those chargod.

For the Freshman “the Court
will be a form of discipline,”
explained Bootle. ‘We want to
remove any cockiness brought
from high school. This cocki-
ness is dangerous to the indi-
vidual since others will recog-
nize it. Actually the Court is
beneficial to only a small por-
tion of the class; but in its aid-
ing one or two individuals, it
has served its purpose. It’s for
those guys who have never been
subject to discipline.”

“1 plan to emphasize its con-
structive part,” Bootle con

tinued. “i'm somewhat dis
tressed about the Court's
elimination from chapel.

More ceoperation from the
upperclassmen is needed, and
chapel without disorder
drums up the interest and
enthusissm needed for them
to turn in the offenders. 1
wish the Council would re-
consider this. ! don’t want
the actions of the Court fo
be so dry that nobody knows
anything about what we're do-
ing.”

Bootle went on to explain that
he would like a little more free-

“if it falls, we can go to the
Council’s system.” He plans to
ask the Council to give him
power to campus extreine cases
for a weekend. “I've talked to
severdl individuals about this.
We would use discretion, of
course, but we need to let them
know we have this power. This
would be used only in cases of
extreme sassiness as we have
experienced before. 1 plan to
present this idea to the Council
at its next meeting.”

YMCA Completes
New Interest Drive

The YMCA completed its In-
terest Drive on Monday night.

Since the YMCA will have no
formal membership in 1960-61,
the Interest Drive is replacing
the Membership Drive.

Bob (R. Henry) Moore, Y vice-
president, headed the Interest
Drive. On Tuesday night the in-
terests of the students were tab-
ulated and each area chairman
made a list of students interest-
ed in working in his area.

The area chairmen have al-
ready begun contacting men to
work in their areas, but the ma-
jor portion of the contact work
will take place during the first
week of school in the fall.

In commenting on the drive,
Moore stated, “Three hundred
and seven returning upperclass-
men have indicated an interest
in working in Y-sponsored ac-
tivities next year. This is ap-
proximately 45 per cent of the
returning three classes.”

“Many of the professors that
voted for the sophomore rush
will not be here next year, so
we should have no trouble
changing the ruling next year,”
one student maintained.

When quized by THE DAV-
(OSONIAN, Professors Trakes
and Goodykoontz stated that
reversal is not at all probable.
“The vote was quite decisive,
and the backing will not be
weakened to any great extent
by the change in faculty per-
sonnel next year,” they main-
tained.

report which covered three
areas. The first area concerned
the fraternity rushing system.

YMCA Asks Council
To Finance Handbook

Jimmy Richardson, President of the YMCA appeared

before the Student Council:

Monday night to present a

proposal that the Student Council take over the publica-
tion of the Wildcat Handbook. “The YMCA is in the pub-
lishing business,” Richardson said, “I'd like to get us out

of it.”

“The cost of publishing the
Wildcat Handbook varies from
year to year. With the resetting
of type, it costs more to print it.
We spent approximately $960
on it, and of this we get back
about $400, so it costs the Y
about $500 to publish the Hand-
book. If it were published by
the Y Student Council, the funds
could come out of the Student
Activities fee.”

The Student Council moved
to recommend to President Mar-
tin that the Administration pro-
vide funds to publish the Wild-
cat Handbook, and that the edit-
ing and publishing of the Wild-
cat Handbook become a part of
the Publication Board, but that
the Student Council select the
editor of the Handbook. The
editors of Quips and Cranks,
THE DAVIDSONIAN, and

Professor William F. Goody-

‘koontz offered the sophomore

plan as a substitute motion. Dis-
cussion followed for approxi-
mately thirty minutes before —
the question was called.

THE DAVIDSONIAN has
been unable to determine defi-
nitely the exact numerical vote.
Reports vary from thirty to
thirty-nine in favor and eighteen
to twenty opposed. This is one
of the few times a faculty com-
mittee’s recommendation has
been rejected.

Following the vote, Professor
Goodykoontz stated that he
would not be opposed to en-
forcement being delayed until
the fall of 1961. Dr. Labban
made this motion, which carried
with only one dissenting vote.

The other two areas on which
the fraternity committee report-
ed were hazing and after-dance
parties. Regarding hazing, the
committee announced that the
IFC was planning “to restrict.
hazing activities in the future.” -

On the problem of after-
dance parties, the committee
stated that it would entertain
any suggestions that other fac-
ulty members might have.

Discussion of sophomore rush-
ing began last November, but

‘it did not reach campus-wide

proportions until February.
Early this semester a number
of fraternity men went inactive,
causing a flurry of student com-
ment. -

Dave Warden, a senior inae-
tive, aroused extensive interest
and criticism by vigorously at-
tacking the present fraternity
setup. He and several indepen-
dents appeared before the fac-
ulty fraternity committee, pro-
posing sophomore rushing as a
solution to current fraternity
shortcomings.

Shortly thereafter, five frat-

ernity men went before the
same committee with o simi-
lar request. These same five
students distributed « five
