THE DAVIDSONIAN OPINIONS

Gull's Nest .. . Bill Gullan
A solution to drop/add

I just had my first experjence
with the wonderful drop/add pro-
cess. I’d always heard peoplecom-
plain about it, but we all tend to
whine about little things, so I
thought it couldn’t be as bad as
everyone said. It is.

Why should people who waste
their afternoons sitting in a hall-
way be rewarded? Why should
athletes who have practice be pre-
vented from getting a good spot in
line? Why should it begin after
classes start, seemingly guarantee-
ing that half the student body falls
behind onthe first day? Why aren’t
cigarettes sold in Chambers?

Assuming that we’re not go-

ing to scrap the whole system, this
is how it should be done:
1. Classes should be filled based
onneed. People who need to fulfill
the core must be permitted to do
so, and those with the least amount
of time left to take a mandatory
class should be given first consid-
eration.

Also, declared majors should
receive first crack at taking thte
classes they need in their majors.
The charmingly egalitarian “first
come, first serve” system is ineffi-
cient and unfair.

‘2. Iwas only given three classes, I

couldn’t have cared less what my

fourth would turn out to be, but I.

needed to sign up for something.
I'll bet that a majority of drop/add
attendees were there not because
they did not receive four. Every-
one. should be given four classes
on theirschedules. If their choices
don’t fit, give them arandom fourth
class, either in their major or.in a
subject they are required to ‘take
for the core. Had I been given any
fourth class, I would not have gone
to drop/add. Neither would many
others, and that would alleviate the
chaos that ensues starting from 2
p-m. (notto mention once the doors
open).

3. Offéf more classes. The student
body is bigger. It’s logical that
more courses are needed. I
wouldn’t even mind if Dean Terry
gave a seminar on what it’s like to
spenda weekend with the Clintons,
or is a “Hug a Tree with Al Gore”
class is offered, or even if a “How
to Jump on the Atlanta Braves
Bandwagon’ isin next year’s cata-
log. We need more classes.

This is how I would fix drop/
add. The day itself is a nightmare,
asisthe result: people with screwed
up schedules and nasty disposi-
tions.

A few rules for newcomers

Tony continued from page 7

the college yell and song by the
seventh day after school opens.

Rule #4. Freshmen must carry
around a lightin order provide one
if so an upperclassmen should re-
quire a smoke.

Rule #9. Freshmen are pro- °

hibited from ambulating upon the
grass.

Rule #17. If an Upperclass-
man is of shorter stature and can-
not reach his cupboard, the Fresh-
man shall lie and act as a step for
said Upperclassman.

Rule #24. Freshmen cannot
date other Freshmen. “(Well,
Davidson was all male back then.)

-It’stoo bad, though, that times
have changed. I wouldn’t mind if
a few of these rules came back just
for a little while.

And to the Freshmen, don’t
worry about the fact that we can
easily spot that y’all are Freshmen.
You too will be able to spy on and
smirk at the next Freshman class.
Trust me, you’re not wearing some
big placard that screams “FRESH-
MAN!!!” but if it were up to me,
you would.

Heaven, Hell, and hubris: tips for the frosh

Figured I’d write some tips
for freshmen.

1) Trafisfer . . . just kidding.

2)Don’tbecocky. Don’t brag
about making __ on your SAT’s,
being on SGA in high school, or
being all-conference in yoursport.
Nobody cares; everyone here did
those things. Just because you
were the greatest thing since cruise
control in your hometown doesn’t
mean you’re anything at Davidson.
This tip is especially important to
those of you who are looking to
join fraternities or eating houses.
If you’re arrogant when you meet
upperclassmen you may never get
a bid.

3) Men: Don’t break up with
your girlfriend back home.
Chances are you are not going to
be able to find a new one at
Davidson. I broke up with minmy
freshmen year, and T still haven’t

found a new one after two years at
Davidson.

4) Women: Break up with your
boyfriend back home. Davidson is
heaven for girls. Don’t waste your
weekends going to see your old
flame when you can pick and
choose from the hundreds of guys
whobroke up with theirhome town
honeys and are now lonely.

5) Do your work in the after-
noon so you can go out at night.
Your freshmen year is the only
time you will be able to get away
with this. After this year, you will
waste your afternoons playing Sega
and watching soap operas. Of
course, most of you are already
doing this. :

6) Memorize the number at
Domino’s pizza. It is 896-8007,
not 892-8007. That is Dr. Larry
Ligo’s number and while he is a
very nice man he and his family

rue the day they were given anum-
ber that should logically not be
theirs.

7) Coats and ties and Sunday
dresses are not required at the
Korner pub.

8) Wake up early enough to
shower before class. Your profes-
sors notice who took the time to
look presentable and who is still
wearing thesame clothes they wore
last night.

_ 9)Don’t let your dirty clothes
pile build up too high.

If you do so you will have to
wear dirty underwear for two days
while the laundry is sort of wash-
ing your clothes.

‘-10) Don’t write for The
Davidsonian. Your writing will
become a mass of cliches and con-
tradictions, and your freshmen
composition teacher will never
speak to you again.

Seay Rations ... Nathan Seay
Men are what? Men are dogs?

Dr. Holland has informed me
that there is actually a group of
people trying to stop the negative
stereotyping of pigs in the world.
You know: pigs are usually por-
trayed as lazy compulsive eaters
who have bad personal hygine.
Think what you will of the PC
movement, but those people do
havea point. Every day womenall
over the world insult and degrade
swine (yes, insult the barnyard
animals) in their cries of, “Men are
pigs!” _

Think about it. What do men
have in common with pigs? We
like the occasional roll in the mud,
we eat almost anything, and most
of the time we smell bad. But the
comparison ends there. After all,
pigs are extremely intelligent ani-
mals.

I beg of you. to leave the pig
alone, but I understand if you want
to associate men with some other
member of the animal kingdom.
Thus, I put forth Nathan Seay’s
Allegory of the Dog. Read it, and
then you may change your tune:

*Picturea long table surrounded
by several chairs. In these chairs

sit women,,of every imaginabte:.« sitnply look:pathetic and hope for .

type. Before each woman sits dif-
ferentmeals. Dozensof dogscircle
around the women at the table,
drooling and begging for some
food.

~ Occasionally, a dog is lucky
enough to receive a bit of food
from one of the women at the table.
After his treat, he usually goes
scampering off to tell his friends of
his feat.

The dogs aren’t complete idi-
ots. The dogs pay more attention
to the girls who indiscriminantly
distribute their food. Some of them
insiston hovering around girls who
never give anything away. I guess
those dogs prefer smelling the food
to actually tasting it.

Invariably, it’s the dogs who
least deserve the food who most
often get it. (It seems that dogs
who have learned to kick a ball
around with their paws have no
trouble getting food.) The dogs
who most deserve it have to suffer
through dry times. :

Methods of getting food vary.
Some dogs nuzzle the girls’ hands
andact friendly. It works forsome
dogs to simply act aloof. Others

a girl to take pity on him and throw
hima piece. This manuver is typi-
cally known as the “sympathy
chuck.”

I don’t want to completely
humiliate dogs. There are some
differences between the dogs in
the Allegory and your run of the
mill spaniel. The Allegory dogs
aren’thappy with the same old dog
food every day. These dogs want
variety.

Every woman at the table has
aslightly different dish. ‘The meals
range from bland starfish to spicy
hot beaver. These dogs want to
taste as many different dishes as
possible. The idea of eating the
same stuff day after day is a scary
prospect. However, the fact that
one gets to eat every day is attrac-
tive, no matter how bland the food
is.

That’s it for my humble at-
tempt to correct the bad name that
pigs have been given by those who
hate men.

’ | hope it’s obvious to every-
one that man’s best friend has more
in common with man than pigs.
Now if Icould only figure out how
they lick their gh, never mind. .
