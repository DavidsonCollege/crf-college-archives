Coble Blasts Poor Progress
Of Open Faculty Proposals

The fate of recent student-
led movements to open facul-
ty meetings has apparently
been left in the hands of the
Faculty Executive Commit-
tee (FEC), according to
former SGA president Ran
Coble. ; :

Coble recently’ appeared
with senior James Trussell
before the faculty to submit
two proposals for open fac-
ulty meetings.

According to Coble, the
faculty, ‘‘after 20 minutes of
discussion on the state of af-
fairs in Denmark and a half
hour of discussion on our pro-
posals, then found their
out, their excuse,’’° and re-
ferred the proposals to the.
FEC for further study.

Since then, the FEC has
met and acted upon the pro-
posals for open faculty meet-
ings, referring them to a
subcommittee.

The subcommittee consists
of Dr. Frank L: Bliss, Dr.
Alexander J: McKelway, Dr.
John D. Kelton SGA
president Danny Clodfelter,
SGA vice-president Bill Alex-
ander, and class presidents
Bill Lear, Mike Creasman,
and Bill Ralston.

Coble has admitted to be-
ing very bitter about the fac-
ulty’s; response to student
overtures for open faculty
meetings. “I'm fed up with
the faculty’s inaction and
lack of response, and I just
don’t care what happens now.
As far as T’m concerned they
are going to do nothing.”’

Administration members,

however, have claimed that >

the situation is not at all as
dark as some students think.
College president Samuel R.
Spencer Jr., said that ‘‘the
faculty for the most, part has
an openness to the considera-
tion of this thing,” referring
to opening faculty- meetings.

“There has not yet been
any debate as such because
the faculty is still studying it
and trying to work out an-

swers to practical questions."

Spencer, chairman of the
FEC, said that several pro-
posals have been given to
the faculty and that the
faculty has requested the
FEC to study them and to
report back to the faculty
with specific recommenda-
tions. :

Also, Spencer said that the
faculty has reaffirmed its de-
cision to set up more effec-
tive communications with
students.

According to Spencer, the
main questions that the fac-
ulty has in the matter, of
open meetings concern _af-
fairs that are exclusively

Vice-president for Academ-
ic Affairs John M. Bevan,
also a member of the FEC,
said, ‘‘I am’ sympathetic to
the sharing of power. I want
representation on all levels,

- and therefore I’m not Oppos-

ed to students attending fac-
ulty meetings."

Bevan emphasized that
“a representation of students
can be an important input in
faculty meetings. I'm speak-
ing of representatives, not
delegates.

“The student representative
idea is great. The input can
be very pertinent.’’

ston as ‘‘very well qualified

raising program and to de-

At Pomona and Whitman,
Winston worked largely with

funding for specific academ-

Belmont Abbey
To Host Writers

Consortium

The first Annual Carolina
Writers and Readers Confer-
ence of the Charlotte Area
Educational Consortium will

-take place at Belmont Abbey

College on April 14.

The idea behind the event
is simple: students and facul-
ty from the participating
schools submit manuscripts
to the conference. Then they
discuss their work with oth-
er participants and with pro-
fessional writers and publish-
ers from the Charlotte area.

Participating schools are
Belmont Abbey, Davidson,
Johnson C. Smith, Queens,
Sacred Heart, UNC-C, and
Wingate.

The Miscellany is offering
a prize covering the $35 en-
try fees to the student sub-
mitting the best manuscript
to someone in the English
Department by noon Friday.
The English Department will
pay the $10 manuscript fee
for any student who wishes
to submit material to the
conference.”

Those attending the. con-
ference will have panel dis-
cussions and group: discus-
sions of the manuscripts sub-
mitted:

interview, he will work main-
ly with faculty members, but
would like to involve students
as well, However, he did'not
as yet know of any specific
projects or financial arrange-
ments with which he would

“At first,” he said, ‘‘We

need to understand the aca-
demic “ policies, and the
dictates of faculty needs, and
then attempt to fund them.”

uring the conversation,

& Winston cited the Carnegie

Commission report on the fi-
nancial status of American
colleges and universities, to
the effect that one. major
eause of the financial prob-
lems of institutions of higher
education is, simply, lack of
management and_ develop-
ment personnel. He now sees

a trend in the opposite direc-
tion. ' ;
“Any college worth any-
thing,’’ he said, ‘‘now has ‘a
full development staff. Times |
are hard for colleges today,
and the schools that are sol-
vent are usually the ones
that have effective develop-
ment staffs,”’

Winston will be in David-
son by about the middle of
May, he said. He will then
send’ for his family, and be-
gin work in his position.

Concerning the financial
future of colleges like David-
son, Winston said his pre-
dictions were ‘‘optimistic.’’
New tax laws governing fourm
dations will help the colleges,
he believes, along with. the
general trend toward more
perceptive financial develop-
ment and planning.

_ Outside Perspective

The U. S. Government. has
begun the manufacture of
two million marijuana cigar-
ettes to be used in laboratory
experiments to see whether
the smoking of Jarge quan-
tities of pot. can lead to can-
cer.

These studies, the first of
their kind, will be done on
mice and hampsters, using
marijuana consifcatéd by the
U.S. Board of Customs.

In an effort to allow 18
year-olds to vote in the elec-
tions next year, a citizens’
lobby, ‘‘Common . Cause,”
has announced that it will
appeal to all state legisla-
tures to quickly ratify a con-
stitutional amendment to en-
franchise this new voting
segment.

To become effective, 38
states must ratify the amend-
ment.

‘Over 200 people completed
a 25-mile hike in a “Walk
Against Hunger’’, sponsored
by the Young World Develop-
ment recently in Chapel Hill
according to The Daily Tar
Heel.

‘Each participant was paid
a certain amount of money

_for each mile he walked by

one or more sponsors whg

backed him.

The money raised, at least
$12,000, will be donated to
various charities, ‘including
15 per cent to the National
Foundation For The Fight
Against Hunger.

There nave been several
developments in recent weeks
concerning the reaction of
college campus leaders to
the People’s Peace Treaty.

At HamptonSidney, the
newspaper editor has refused
the sign the treaty and came
out editorially against it, as
did the editor at St. Joseph's
of Indiana.

Both the president of the
student body and. the editor
at- William and Mary have
signed the treaty. According
to The Flat Hat, the student
newspaper, the treaty will
soon be made available to
the student body.

At Chapel Hil, the editor
of the UNC Daily Tar Heel
signed the treaty and came
out in favor of it on the edi-
torial page. The president of
the student body also signed
it.

Both the student editor and
the SGA president of West
Virginia University have sign-
ed, but the student. legisla-
ture has refysed ‘to ratify the
treaty. ‘ =
