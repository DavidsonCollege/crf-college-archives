COLLEGE JOURNALISTS
GUESTS OF SALEM AT
SEMI-ANNUAL MEETING

Byron Hayworth, Editor of The
Guilfordian, Sounds Keynote of
Convention in Opening Address

—Other Editors Speak

Declaring that the college press stands in
danger of exercising “too much freedom,”
Byron Hayworth, editor of the Guilfordian,
and president of the North Carolina Col-
legiate Press Association, urged a reaction-
ary move against excessive liberty, in his
address before the twelfth semi-annual ¢on-
vention of ‘North Carolina college editors, at
Salem College, last week. Mr. Hayworth’'s
address was a high-light on the calendar of
the greatest collegiate press convention ever
held in North Carolina,

“We have been asking for more freedom,”
he said, “when in reality we have too much
freedom already! We even now in
danger of losing the very valuable and neces-
sary assistance and supervision of our fac-
ulty members.”

are

Following this declaration against the free-
dom of the college press, Mr. Hayworth ex-
plained to his listeners the peculiar respon-
sibility of the college editors. He urged the
co-operation of the convention delegates in
establishing greater prestige and recognition
for American colleges and college students,
pointing out that much of the criticism of
our colleges and universities is due to the
improper exploitation of campus
college newspapers.

His address was heard by more than 50
delegates, representing the leading college
publications of the state. For the first time
in the history of the association, representa-
tives of all the college newspapers, magazines
and annuals in the state were present.

The convention opened last Thursday with
a get-together meeting in the campus  recep-
tion room at Salem College, at which time
