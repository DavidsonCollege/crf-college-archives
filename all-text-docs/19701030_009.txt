If Davidson's soccer’ team
thinks last week's assign-
ment was rough, they had
better hope next week does
hot come, ‘They ain't seen
nothin’ yet," according to

Terriers Down
Caf Rifle Team

Davidson's rifle team got
olf to a dissappointing sea-
son start losing their first
match of the season to Wof-
ford, 1088 to 1187.

“This is a relatively new
team and nearly everyone
shot a lot worse than they
had been in practice,’’ team
captain Max Thomason said.

Jim Maxwell was the top
performer for the Wildcats
as he shot 232. Thomason
remarked that the freshman
had never shot that well in
practice.

Thomason shot a 226 after

consistently firing around
250 in practice.

Other scores in the match
were: Billy Mohr, 217; Lar-
ry Kroll, 206; and Gary
Riggs, 169.

Only the top four scores
counted in the team score.

The shooters missed,, the
services of- Tom Maxwell in
the first match. Maxwell
was a member of the team
last year.

Thomason expects. Joel

Bradley, Tony Oakley, and

‘Ken Williams to be ‘compet-
ing in. other matches this
season.

The team is coached by
Capt. Richard P. Carmody
of the ROTC Department.
Carmody is assisted by Sgt.
Benjamin F. Turpin.

Coach Harry Fogleman.

In the Belmont-Abbey
game, the home team led
2-0 at the half. But the visit-
ing ‘Cats got three goals’in
the second half, two coming

termed —“‘“‘a-—-very-—_h-a-r-d
game."’ It was the third
time in as many years that

the Belmont-Abbey game
had been decided by one
goal.

As far_as Davidson is con-
cerned, There was just too
much Craig Hannas in the
St. Andrews contest. The
small college all-American
goalie made 18 saves’ and
then booted in the tying goal
with less than a minute and
a half left in the game.

After taking a 14 lead in
the first quarter, the maitch
turned into a_ scoreless
struggle until. Mike Taylor
was called for a hand ball
in the penalty area with
just one minute and twenty
seconds left in the fourth
quarter.

St. Andrews brought Han-
nas up from his goalie posi-
tion, and he booted the im-
portant goal. In last year’s
game, Hannas beat the Wild-
cats with a penalty kick in
the closing minutes of play.

Jim Montgomery played an
outstanding game at goalie

The IMAC flickerball re-
gular season ended last Fri-
day, and as a prelude to the

playoffs an allstar game
was played Monday, Oct.
26.

The “B" division stars

routed the standouts of the
“A” division by the decisive
score of 44-14.

Displaying a devastating
offense and a tenacious de-
fense, the “‘B’ stars jump-
ed to a commanding 31-7
halftime advantage and
coasted the remainder of
the game.

The ‘‘B" offense was pac-

_ ed by tailback Buzz Tarver

of the SPE's, who tossed
two touchdown passes and
deftly executed the offen-
sive plays, Tarver's scoring
passes wére to fellow Sig
Eps Jim Cantrell and Wade
Stiepherd. %

Cantrell, who was playing
in place of injured David
Russell of the Kappa Sigs,
also fired for two scores
from his halfback position.
Pikas Ray Swetenberg and
(Mark Affeldt were on the re-
ceiving end of thése aeriels.

The “‘B"' defense also took
part in the scoring, as vhey
returned two of three inter-
cepted passes for  touch-
downs. Pika Floyd Strand,
SPE David Shepler and
Gamm Scott Nicholson were
the thieves of the passes.

Other standouts on the
‘\B" defense were Sweten-
berg and Kappa Sig Frank
Clark, who used their decid-
ed height advantage to block
several passes.

Tarver praised Affeldt for
his outstanding receiving
noting that he made sever-
al diving grabs. Tarver al-
so pointed out that the pre-
sence of Cantrell, Shepherd,
and Shepler made his job
easier,
plays were those used by
the Sig Eps em the re-
gular season.

Six runners broke .thé Da-
vidson cross country course
record as Appalachian won
a five team meet here on
Oct. 27.

Appalachian placed six of
the top ten runners, and de-
feated, in order of finish,
Pembroke, High Point, Wake
Forest, and Davidson.
Jim Gulledge of
Forest

Wake
lowered the course
cutting over
a minute off of the ‘old 27:02
record. Gary Church, and
George Philipps of Appala-
chian, Victor .Elk and Ro-
bert Knowles sof Pembroke,
and Mike Turmala of High
Point all broke the former

record: by at least 25 se-

conds.
Coach Sterling Martin was

D

more than satisfied with the
Wildcats’ performance de-
spite the last-place finish.
‘Most of the boys improved

their times over the last:

meet. “This also happened:
last year, and I really don't
know why the times Hn prOY:

ed."

Howard Boyd finished
first for Davidson, his time
of 28:38 being good for 19th
place. The fact that Boyd
bettered his previous best
time by 27 seconds is indi-
cative of the fine race he
ran.

Joe Shibley finished 23rd
for the ‘Cats, and in the pro-
cess bettered his best time
by 42 seconds.

The most effective plays
for the “B" offense were
pitchouts to Cantrell, who
4hen flicked downfield, and

quick look-in passes to Af-
\~ feldt and Swetenberg.

As far as the ‘‘A’ division
was concerned, it was simp-
ly a case of being outclass-
ed. The defense showed a
particular weakness on cov-
ering second passes after ar
initial flick play, The ‘A’
stars also rushed two men
om many occasions enabl-

ing the “‘B" team to pene-
trate more easily.
Offensive standout was

Bick Halligan of the Delts,
whe threw two teuchdewn
passes from his taliback
position. Fellow Delt Jeff
Chet turned in his usual
outstanding receiving per.
formance.

“A” rusher Bob Meadows
of the SAE's put.a good hard
rush on Tarver throughout
the game.

Other participants for the
‘A’ allStans were: Herb
Clegg, Sigma Chi; David
Weaver, SAE; Rhett Tal-
bert, ATO; Roy Campbell,

In a battle of freshman
squads, Cannon II, who fin-
ished the regular season’ 5
and 5, advanced to a Thurs-
day encounter with the Phi
Gamms.

by squeaking past the vast-
ly improved Pi Kapps (44)
by. the score of 24-19.

In other action, the ATO's
(44) romped past hapless
Cannon I (19) by a convince
