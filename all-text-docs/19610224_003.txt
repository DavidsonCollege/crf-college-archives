Many Thanks, Bill
__ Many thanks are due to Bill Godwin for the excellent
job he has done as Sport's Editor this year. Bill was con-
stantly concerned with keeping his readers up to date on
the news from one of the most important departments

(and nee the most often overlooks) at Davidson
College — athletics.
We Were Robbed!

If Lefty Driesell jumped out of his chair and stomped |
beautiful Memorial Auditorium (and he did), he had|
plenty of reasons for doing so.

The greatest robbery since the famous Brink’s affair
was going on. Only this time, the crooks were not stealing
money, but a precious conference basketball victory from |
the desperate Davidson Wildcats.
No Basket

The robbery took place in the following manner:
Haywood Evans, Wildcat guard, took a pass from a team-
mate and proceeded to drive for the basket. As he went
up forthe lay-up, he ran into a Paladin. However, Evans
managed to shoot the ball, which beautifully spun through
the net.

The defending Paladin had of course hit the floor
shrill of a whistle.

The referee, Mr. ‘Rocky’ Hartzog, who has a great
deal of experience calling high school games in and
around Salisbury, yelled, “Charging, number 31, red!”

This wasn’t a bad call since the charging or blocking
could have gone either way. However, Hartzog threw fat
on the fire when he surprisingly exclaimed, “No basket!”’
Basket Should Have Counted

The 1961 NCAA rule book plainly states (in essence)
that if any player who is fouled or fouls while in the act |
of shooting, makes the basket, the basket counts.

Evans was definitely in the act of shooting when he
“charged,’ and he made the basket. Evidently, Mr. |
Hartzog, our high school expert, missed the call.

Naturally, Driesell was mad. The call couldn’t have |
come at a better time for Furman. There were seven or |
eight minutes left in the game, and Davidson led by six
points. We would have gladly tradded a basket for
two free throws. As it was, Furman cut the lead, and
eventually went on to win by one point, 71-70.

I'll admit that this one call didn’t actually lose the
game for Davidson. There are always a hundred “if’s”
anytime one loses a ball game. I do say that the call broke
rally.

Following the game, a Furman player admitted, “It
was a bad call.”

A Questionable Game

Hartzag and his cohort, Art Kapper, well known to
local fans, called a questionable game. Figure this one
out. Davidson made seven more field goals than Furman.
Davidson out-rebounded Furman, 47-40. Yet, Davidson
lost.

Obviously, the difference came on the free throw

line. Furman had only eight fouls called on them; David-
son was charged with 19. Thus we went to the line nine
times, while the Paladins felt right at home after 27 trips
there.

Something Should Be Done

I am not questioning the integrity of Hartzog, Kap-

per, or any of the men in stripes. I am concerned over the
ability of some. of these men. After all, the Southern
Conference is “big time’ college ball, and should strive
to get the best personnel available for this important
phase of the game. .

Referees. are human and are going to make mistakes,
but there are those who will make fewer mistakes than

others. These men should be obtained, trained, and paid

well.

Something should be done about home court domina-

tion also. Some schools (examples - VPI, UNC) are vir-

tually unbeatable on their home court. A referee can’t

help being swayed in his decision when thousands of
hostile looking young men threaten his safety.

vastly tomorrow. ‘We don't
want to overestimate or under-

“but VPI is capable of beating
us bad, or we can edge them
out. It will be the best meet of
the year.”

The problem of team depth
that has hampered the ‘Cats to
a degree throughout the entire
season remains the Achilles’
heel of the team. Department
for department, Shoe ranks his
‘Catfish with the conference
best.

But VPI and VMI rest their
power on a heavily-stocked re-

is dependent on_ individual
workhorses, such as Tom Hud-
gins and Stephen Young.

Pfeiffer Here Tuesday In
Grapplers‘ Home Final

By GEORGE PEPPER
Davidsonian Sports Writer

The Davidson matmen will close their regular season here Tuesday night at 7:30

grapplers have posted a 4-5 record with wins over Pfeiffer, North Carolina, Emory,

thus gave the ‘Cats a 20-17 win
over State. Tom Wright, Butch
LeDoyen, Ben McCoy, and
Charles Trask provided 17

and a draw respectively.

The wrestling squad will go

Since VMI beat Richmond,
78-75, Tuesday night, they prac-

unless the ‘Cats pounce on the
Bulldogs and bring home a v:c-
tory.

PLAY TO WIN

When asked about the crucial
Citadel game, Coach Driesell
said: “This game is going to be
a tough one, but the boys don't
want to stop now. From now on
we play to win.”

The Wildcats lost a real thril-
ler Saturday night to Furman
71-70. Leading scorer was Bill
Shinn with 22 points, and Joe
Markee was the leading reboun-
der with 22 snares. This is the
most rebounds that a Davidson
cager has grabbed this season in
a single game

Joe Markee has been the lead-

year long. Bill Jarman has done
an excellent job under the bas-
ket, while Bill Shinn has been
popping the ball through the
net with amazing accuracy
lately.

The Davidson freshman team
has a record of 6 wins against
7 losses. Driesell feels that this
year's freshman team will help
the varsity a great deal next
year and provide Davidson with
a better ball club.
