Barnes, newly appointed As-
sistant to the President,
smiled and responded serious-
ly, ‘‘I was very pleased and
honored when Dr. Spencer
offered me the position.

“TI feel that the job will
provide me with opportunities
for a combination of things.
First, to take a break from the
academic world before plung-
ing into law school, to learn
useful skills in organization
and writing and also to meet
and work with new and inter-
esting people.

Outgoing Assistant Peter
Clark '76 elaborated on these
opportunities. ‘I’ve been able
to see things from a totally
different point of view without
being coerced into accepting
it.

“Going from a student to an
administrator has introduced
me to a much broader perspec-
tive of the college and it has
definitely been enlightening.

“The job is unique in that
one is neither fish nor fowl,”

‘Carter presents energy plan vista ser

Wednesday night, April.21,
President Jimmy Carter intro-
duced to Congress and the
public his proposals for a
nationwide energy conserva-
tion program.

The Davidsonian would like
to synopsize for you here the:

major proposals of a plan
Carter says ‘‘can lead to an

_even better life for the people

of America.”

— eCarter proposes a standby
tax on gasoline that could
gradually raise taxes by five-
cent increments to 50 addi-
tional cents per gallon by 1987

if the country did not meet the .

goal of a ten percent cut in
consumption

continued Clark, ‘‘which has
its advantages as well as
disadvantages.

“I've enjoyed the pleasures
of Davidson without having
the pressures of study al-
though knowing where to fit
between studenfs and admini-
stration can prove to be diffi-
cult.”’ ,

Barnes feels this so-called
“identity crisis’’ will be no
problem.

He realizes the importance
of his close ties with the
student body and: recognizes

WDAV seeks Federal funds

By PHILIP DUN. 4!
News Editor ,

Director of Communications
Martha Roberts has submit-
ted a request for federal mon-
etary assistance in funding the
upgrading of WDAV.

the Program for Noncommer-

would, over three years, raise
the price to the prevailing
world level, about $14 per

the need to keep in touch with
what students are thinking in
order to effectively handle his
position.

‘‘My door will always be
open to students and I hope to
stay in touch with student
desires and needs,’’ Barnes
said.

He also encourages students
to approach the President
themselves when they have
something to say.

As to whether he will serve
as a ‘‘channel’’ to the Presi-
dent for others’ opinions or

radio station as $187,000.
The college is seeking the
maximum level of assistance
from the government —75 per-
cent, or about $140,000.

voice his own “depends upon
the issue and the role feelings
are expécted to play’, whether
he is asked to speak as an
individual or as a representa-.
tive of some part of the
college.

“There is a time and a place
for both,”” concluded Barnes.

Clark also employed the
informal “‘open door’’ policy of
liaison between students and
administration.

He feels, however, that his
job dealt more directly with
relations between the college

expenditures involved in
transforming the station to
high power.

Roberts stressed that the
figures in the request are of
necessity estimates, because
plans for the radio station are
‘still in the flexible stage."

Much will depend on the
amount of financial assistance
offered by the government.

Roberts explained that
some of the equipment costs

automation equipment and
air-conditioning and remodel-

ing of the studio, and might be |

reevaluated in light of the

degree of funding provided by -

the government.

Roberts indicated that the
listed costs could well be
higher than actual expendi-
tures.

“If we erred in our esti-
mates, we tried to err on the
cautious side. We tried to

anticipate all expenditures, so
we don’t end up short of cash .

at a later date,”” Roberts said.

Roberts is not certain when
the college will receive word of
the federal government's deci-

and the Trustees. Trustee
meetings and convocations are
two major responsibilities of
the Assistant as well as gen-
erally helping Dr. Spencer
with whatever needs to be
done.

One ot Ulark’s pet projects
is to compose a handbook of
helpful hints and suggestions
from past assistants to guide
the ‘“‘newcomer’’.

The tact tnat there is a
newcomer each year means
that ‘‘the job can be ap-
proached differently each time
around—there are no prereq-
uisites as to how the job has
always been done.”’

Clark also asserts that the
year has been ‘‘an educational
experience’ and he now plans
to continue his formal educa-
tion at Vanderbilt Law School
in September.

Barnes looks forward to the
experience and is already en-
thusiastic about his possible
role in certain issues, such as
the vandalism problem, which
are facing the college today.
