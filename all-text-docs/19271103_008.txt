THE DAVIDSONIAN,. NOVEMBER 3, 1927 —

DEBATE TRYOUTS

divorce and loosening of home ties, and
should prove excellent for short snappy
speeches full of facts.

All members of the squad will be noti-
fied before Christmas whether they are
alternate or are on a team, the exact
dates of all debates will also be known
by that time. Several are pending but
it is fairly certain they will begin about
March Ist and continue through May Ist.

The schedule as arranged includes a
southern trip on which Emory, Sewanee,
and Florida will be met and a northern
trip with Rutgers and two other colleges
yet to be determined definitely, furnishing
the opposition. In addition, teams rep-
resenting Rutgers, William and Mary,
and Duke will invade the campus and
meet Davidson on her home territory.

All men expecting to try out are re-
quested to see Henry Powell, Robert
Grady, Frank Hall, W. K, Pritchett, or
R. L. Dumas, before Thanksgiving. Any
who fail to give this notification will
not be allowed to take p This is
necessary in order to determi the ex-

from God led to the downfall of Israel
and will surely lead to the destruction of
our own land if it is not checked. There-
fore, it is entirely up to the young men
of the present to prepare themselves to
check this rapid race toward disaster
and to develop the characteristics that
the fight will need.

A balance between the mind and body
is essential, of course. After it is ob-
tained, Dr, Sullivan gave as the necessi-
ties of the Christian “a heroic manhood,
a supreme faith in God with love for His
commands, principles, and ideals, and ut-
ter and absolute devotion to one’s fellow
man.” With these characteristics in ev-
ery Christian college graduate, the fight
is practically won.

Dr. Sullivan also lamented the change
in the home life of many. He charged ev-
eryone to work hard for a Christian home
of peace and happiness, so that its influ-

in the library in the near future.

The new plan is expected to reduce
materially the confusion caused by a
series of tryouts and should result in a
heightened interest'in Davidson debating
circles.

It is only two weeks until Dr. Vander
Meulen will be here to lead the fall Life-
work campaign and the “Y” is expecting to
have a great series of meetings. Have you
read his book, “Getting Out of the Rough?”
It reveals a man and his very strong per-
sonality, and is extremely interesting. It is
in the “Y” room at all times for you to
read and will prove well worth the time you
mak give it. The “Y” quartet and the Glee
Club quartet will assist in these services and
will render special music at each meeting.
Professor Cullum has also agreed to aid with
the music in these services.

PUSS ee

The “Y” is starting a class in personal and
public sanitation for negroes. This work is
under the direct supervision of John Foster,
but the class will be taught by Westbrook.
This is further evidence of the growth of

valuable a place it occupies in the life of peo-
ple around the college.
pels Ve,

Dr. Edgar Gammon will be the speaker at
vespers this Sunday. Dr. Gammon will be
remembered by many as the most interesting
man who led the services during the spring
meeting last year. He is an excellent speak-
er and thinker and ought to have a good
audience.

Dr. Wade C. Smith has definitely consent-
ed to come to Davidson and lead the Rer-
sonal Work Conference, which will probably
be held in December, but if not then, im-
mediately following Christmas. Have you a
copy of “The Testament for Fishers of Men”
which Dr. Smith edited? It is a very valu-
able little volume and is widely known.

ence will not only be contained in the
family but-will spread to others around.
He painted a beautiful picture of a happy
home, and then introduced evil, and show-

ed the audience the horrible change
brought about by despair and dis-
honor. He gave as another need for the

influence of the home, the fact that ex-
treme culture ousts religion and the fun-
demental teachings of Christianity must
be so instilled in children as to prevent
such a happening later in their lives. The
devil will not be conquered by intellect,
“but by standing manfully shoulder to
shoulder for the right.”

With the following words, Dr. Sullivan
closed his talk with: “What do we need?
We need you, in whatever vocation God
may call you to, to put yourself in touch
with God, not having your own inter-
ests solely in view, but having a heart

crated and faithful, saying, ‘Use me when
and where you will, if it costs me my
life, for Christ will repay me for the
wreckage I have helped avoid.”

MILITARY PARADE

(Continued from page one)
the return of children back home after an
absence, means to their parents.”

Dr. J. M. McConnell then was _ in-
troduced and read the list of all alumni
who had died during the past year. He
stated that more alumni died last year
than in any recent year.

Dr. J. P. Munroe, prominent physician
of Charlotte and a loyal Davidson alum-
nus, was the next speaker, and he used
as his subject, “How Davidson played
football in the old days.” He mentioned
something of the history of football and
how it originated in Rome. It was played
then under a different name, and the ball
was kicked up and down the streets,
never being touched with the hands.
Later it was introduced nto England, but
Edward III prohibited its being played
because of the danger involved to the
players and passers-by. The game was
further developed in: England, and final-
ly played under the name of Rugby.
When football was played at Davidson in
early ’8o's, the ball was kicked all of the
time. A few years later the modern game
of football as we know it began to be de-
veloped, and has since been played by the
Davidson teams,

After his graduation from Davidson,
Dr. Munroe returned to the college and
held a number of important positions, one
of them being that of freshman football
coach. He also referred most of the Da-
vidson games and many others through-
out the state at that time. Dr. Munroe
stated that the secret of the success of a
football team was their being coached and
drilled, until they could not make a mis-
take. “Davidson coaches,” he said; “are
now using this method, and one sees the
results of the games.”

Dr. Oren Moore, also a prominent

alumnus

of Davidson,: now living in

the “Y” in every direction and shows how}.

Charlotte, was then initroduced and sopke
of “How Davidson has been playing the
game this season.” Dr, Moore is very
much interested in ‘the Davidson teams
and never misses one of their games if he
is anywhere near. He said that the type
of spirit and playing displayed by men
on Davidson teams is that of the real
athlete. .

“The outcome of the game with V. M.
I,” was the subject of a few words by
Dr. W. T. Thompson, of Richmond, Va.,
a member of th eclass of 1905. He stated

‘/that V. M. I. had a good team, and that

if victory came to Davidson it would be
only after a hard fought game. “The
spirit of the Wildcats,” Dr. Thompson
stated, “makes a good loser as well as a
good winner.”

At the conclusion of these. exercises
dinner was served in the gymnasium to all
of the alumni.

WILDCATS BOW BEFORE

(Continued from page one)
were stopped and forced to kick. In this
kicking first quarter V. M. I. assumed the
advantage and held it through the game
always getting the punts off early for

good gains.

Early in the second quarter V. M. I.
punted to Grey on his own forty yard
marker and the ball slipped through his
arms, being recovered by a Cadet. Here
was the first break of the game. The
Cadets took the ball here and on the first
play Hawkins went around left end with
unbelievable swiftness, side-stepping,
twisting and turning over the remaining
forty yards to the goal. Extra point was
kicked from placement and 7-0 was the
score,

Immediately the Wildcats got wild and
started on a great offensive thrust. Tak-
ing the ball from the kickoff they started
a drive through the line of the Cadets
that took them off their feet. Harrison,
Grey and Nesbit were clipping off nice
gains and went for five first downs in suc-
cession. Being fifteen yards from the
goal line, four plays put the ball five yards
from the final marker. After three plays
against the line the ball was seven yards
from over and here a pass was com-
pleted from Grey to Harrison who failed
to get over the line by less than a yard.
This was the last danger that the Cadets
suffered as two attempted field goals in
the first quarter failed to make the bar.
_The soldiers took the ball and punted
well away from their goal and the Da-
vidson team again tried to come back but
their efforts were in vain as they at-
tempted a pass in their own territory and
the ball found its way into the arms of a
Cadet. Here they took advantage of their
second chance to make a blow. On the
next play McCray shot a long pass to
Nabers who pulled it from the ozone and
raced through the secondary defense over
the goal line. The play covered thirty-
five yards, The kick for extra point was
blocked.

But the Wildcats fought doggedly on
by the aerial mode of attack. Many of
the passes were good but the Cadets had
them sufficiently covered to keep them
out of the danger zone. Late in the last

quarter the Wildcats were _ continuing
their desperate passing attack and again
the V. M. I. team intercepted one of them
37 yards from the Wildcat goal. For the
third time the Cadets took on life when
they needed it and here McCray took the
ball through the line for a first down.
Nabers lessened the distance to two yards’
and here it looked as though the David-
son line would hold them off but the ball
was taken on the fourth down and the
extra point was good.

The Davidson line was weak while in
enemy territory. Jim Grey was substi-
tuted for his first entry since the open-
ing game and showed up well. Harrison,
Dick Grey and Nisbet -were good on the
offense and the latter snagged many
passes. The Cadet backfield played the
greatest defensive game seen here while
Munday, O’Berry and Moss played games
in the line.
