‘Catonsville Nine’

By DOUG BROWN
Managing Editor

“The Trial of the Catonsville
Nine” will be presented at the
old Phi Gam House ¢u Mon-
day and Tuesday, February 14
ind 15 at 8 p.m.

The play depicts the trial of
nine Catholic protestors, who,
under the leadership of Philip
and Daniel Berrigan, burned
over 300 draft files at Catons.-
ville, Maryland, co May 17 1968.

Senior Howard Ramagli, tech.
nical director of ‘‘The Trial of
The Cattnsville Nine” = said,
“This play is more real than
most because the people depict-
ed are presently in jail for what
they believe in. The cast has
some stake in these beliefs.

“The Berrigan brothers show
that there is a higher law which

ROTC Opens Option
For Lottery Losers

Freshmen who received low
numbers in last week's draft
lottery and are not enrolled in
the ROTC program can still get
in the program. '‘Freshmen who
have not signed up can sign up
for the spring term,” said
Thomas Dixon, assistant profes-
sor of Military Science.

These students would have to
take the ROTC class and drill
this spring and would finish the
freshman course the fall and
winter terms of the sophomore
year. Since sophomore ROTC
requires only two terms, a stu-
dent would have to take two
courses simultaneously only in
the winter term.

Also, those freshmen who drew
high numbers in the recent draft
lottery and wish to drop the
ROTC program are encouraged
to finish the present term. Dix-
on said, “If a person drops
ROTC during the term, he is

given a failure.” On the other
hand, a student who finishes
out the term will be give an
incomplete.

should direet human _ bchavior
and noi. just man made laws.
This play is significant because
it deals with problems that peo-
ple face who don't agree with
the government.”

Although some of the cast have
memorized their lines, most will
be reading their parts from
their scripts. The reading stands
will be noticeable, and no at-
tempt will be made to make the
performances appear extremely
professional. Instead. the actors
will work at getting the audi-
ence to develop a feel for what
Danie! Berrigan and the people
at Catonsville are trying to say.

Associate Professor of Eng-
lish Anthony S. Abbott decided
to do ‘‘The Trial of the Catons.
ville Nine’? this fall. However.
the movement to put this play
on received an added impetus
when Sister McAlister, one of
those connected with the Ber
rigan brothers, spoke on cam.
pus in late fall. The perform.
ances will be dedicated to her.

Abbot is the director of ‘‘The
Trial of the Catonsville Nine.”
Assistant Professor of Political
Science William E. Jackson will
portray Daniel Berrigan. Philip
Berrigan will be played by As-
sistant Professor of Physics Rob-
ert J. Manning. A number of
other faculty members and stu-
dents will also be in the play.

The charge for admission will
be $1.00. No one will be seated
after the performance . begins.
us a full house is expected each
night. The old Phi Gam House
will hold 75 per performance.

In Political Workshop Debate

JOHN CASSELS
Staff Writer

The two leading candidates
for the Ninth Congressional Dis-
trict seat confrcuied each other
on the Davidson campus Tues-
day afternoon,

Although both candidates, Re-
publican County Commissioner
and Davidson Professor Jim
Martin and Democrat State Leg-
islator Jim Beatty, sought to
quell the rumor that this was not
their first ‘‘confrontaticn’, they
did amit that it was their first
public appearance together since
announcing their respective can-
didacies.

The appearance of the candi-
dates was the finale to a polit-
ical workshop held on Monday
and Tuesday. Short speeches
and question-and-answer _ peri-
ods afterwards were given at
10 a.m. and 3 p.m. each day.

Jim Beatty, six years in the
State legislature, said there was
an wide range of reasons for his
being in the race. ‘‘When I look
at my own background: when I
look at my own experience: |
know i am qualified to repre-
sent this cengressional district.”
He said he [elt that people's
concern for economic stability
wotild provide one of the issues
for the campaign.

Later Beatty introduced Pat
Butler. president of the Meck-
lenburg County Young Demo
crats Cluh, who ‘talked about
campaigning. He said the pri-
mary objective in the campaign
was to project the candidate's

message to the public, and in do-
ing this a campaign manager is
limited by his resources of mon-
ey, manpower, time, and facili-
ties.

Jim Martin opened by saying,
“|. . I don’t plan to get into a
footrace with Jim.” Beatty is a
former international track star.
Martin outlined the theme of
his campaign which included
strengthening local government,
developing a practical, sensible
approach to cleaning up the en-
vircnment, and carrying on re-
tiring Representative Charles
Jonas’ practice of making the
congressman available to the
constituents.

Martin introduced his cam-
paign chairman, Robert Brad-
shaw, who said that he had ac-
cepted his position because he
felt that in all his dealings with
Commissicner Martin, Martin
had never made a decision out
of political expediency.

other questions from the audi-
ence.

Ralph Huitt, former Assistant
Secretary of HEW for legisla-

tion, spoke informally Monday
morning on ‘‘Elections '72”. Em-
phasis was on the meaning of
advanced technology to cam-
paigns and that candidates
should not be forced to take
stands on vital issues in the
heat of a campaign. Huitt ex-
pressed faith in the democratic
process and asserted, ‘‘The sys-
tem is responsive to what it
conceives to be a consensus.”
Members of the women’s cau-
cus of Mecklenburg County, Re-
publican Mrs. H. A. Bissell and
Democrat Mrs. Louise Brennan,
spoke on the increasing role of
women within the party and in
campaigns, Monday afternoon.
County party chairmen, Hen-
ry Wilmer, Republican, and A.

_Myles Haines, Democrat, spoke

on the responsibilities of chair-
men in the campaigns. They
both emphasized party structure
and the opportunity for any in-
terested party member to at-
tain leadership positions.

William Culp, Sr. of the county
board of elections then talked

day.
