Kilpatrick Expresses Views

Of Conservative Columnist

Asst. Managing Editor

James |. Kilpatrick ad-
dressed an assorted assembly
of students, faculty, and ad-
ministration Tuesday night in a
speech entitled ‘A  Con-
servative Looks at the
Washington Scene."

He found on revision of elec-
tion laws, restraint of power.
and the biographies of the fallen
powerful.

On recent events. he noted
that we should heed their exam-
ple to make sure that ‘God
reigns and government sur-
vives

Examining Watergate. he
believed that Nixon's per-
sonality contributed much to
the actions of his aids.

“By nature he is withdrawn.
reserved. cautious and highly
disciplined, but he has done
some things that should have
been left undone and left undone
things needing to be done."’ This
manner pressured his aids into
instigating the Watergate
buggings.

He cited Nixon's statement
A president just does not pick
up the phone and call someone”’
as an example of channels
being carried to the extreme.
the main reason for Watergate.

Focusing attention on the
vice-presidency he said, ‘‘The
biography of Agnew is what
great novels are made of. His
resignation has touched me
deeply. I have defended him
time after time because his
criticisms of the press have
made reporters more fair in
their reporting. This is cer-
tainly a shattering blow."

Kilpatrick feels that there
are, however, lessons to be lear-
ned from the ‘‘Agnew tragedy.”
if not heeded ‘‘we will be
doomed to repeat this."’

Restraint of this power is a
congenial topic for. con-
servatives. It is what binds the
constitution together."

restraint of power; power was
abused in the White House and
Dean seemed to adapt a ‘‘screw

our enemies” attitude demon-
strative of this.”

Next, Kilpatrick feels that we
must, in some fashion, find an-

swers to the problem of
political campaign con-
tributions which tend to
corrupt.

He cited ITT and the milk
price increase after the
Dairymen_ contributed to

Nixon's campaign as having
“the appearance of im-
propriety. bribery and pay-off
Money does talk and people do
listen. We must curb this buying
off of. public officials to restore
the faith and confidence of the
people.”

He gave his tentative support
to the new bill passed for public
tax funds for elections. He is.
however, far from certain that
this is right because it gives an
advantage to the incumbants.

‘I question that we can con-
Stitutionally put limits on this
aspect of free speech. The
problem of contributions should
be resolved on a voluntary basis
by the two major parties. It
should be a matter of honor bet-
ween the two parties to restrain
this abuse.

‘Finally we must seek
genuinely out of our hearts for
philosophic and patriotic
rededication. "

‘We have the great strength
of millions of law abiding.
decent Americans plus our
material wealth. Our strong
reserves of vitaltiy must now be
remobilized. recaptured and
rechanneled.”’

In the question-answer period
that followed, he stated that he
did not believe we would repeat
the Vietnam mistakes in the
Mid-east although we have
passed familiar landmarks
from the bloody road to Viet-
nam.

“It would be a disastrous
catastrophe which would rip us

apart, outdoing anything we
have ever seen. The public
would not support sending
troops, and Israel has not
requested them.”

In the 1976 election he projec-
ts Ford. Rockefeller, Regan.
Conally and Percy as possible
candidates with Baker as a
probable vice-president. He
sees Kennedy as a _ shoe-in
Democratic nominee

“Unless the spasm. of
morality will have run its course
we will have a Mr. Clean vs.
Mr. Clean election with a
reform candidate coming in like
Sir Lancelot.”

He commented that Nixon
was either a crook or in-
competant regarding
Watergate. But he doubts that
he will be impeached unless he
is actively defiant of the
Supreme Court tape ruling.

He feels that the Supreme
Court will find some way of get-
ting around the tapes. ‘The
deviousness of the Supreme
Court will find some device of
one-up-manship through which
both sides shall win.”

In a speaking engagement here on Tuesday night, conservative
James Kilpatrick addressed himself to various topics relating to
the Washington scene. He labeled Agnew's resignation as a ‘‘shat-

tering blow.”

Pre-managerial Program Exists

The student Senate again
voted down subsidized football
in its meeting this week.

“This would mean that foot-
ball players couldn't receive
scholarships for more money
than their financial need is,”
Steve Bell, who introduced the
resolution, said.

“This would only apply to
students coming in as _fresh-
men, however. People who have
scholarships now would keep
them,’’ Bell added. Bell's
resolution was also passed by
last year’s Senate.

Action by the Board of
Trustees is required, however,
before any change actually
takes place.

DAVIDSONIAN editor Alec
Hoon suggested a resolution to
the Senate that THE DAVID-
SONIAN editor be paid. Hoon
said he had taken the idea to the
administration and would like
to have the Senate support it.

This resolution will be

A pre-managerial program at
Davidson is more an idea thana

continue to do that."’

A pre-mangerial program
would correlate to already
existing pre-professional plans,
explained Ratliff. ‘It would
keep a student interested in a
Managerial career’ from
barking up the wrong tree,”’ he
added.

Whether a pre-mangerial
program will be developed, still
seems to be in question.

The Senate accepted a
resolution by Todd Eades that

On Friday, Oct. 12a Davidson

an unknown assailant on Pat-

While the man carried a gun,
the girl was not physically
beaten. An intense search for
the assailant was begun im-
