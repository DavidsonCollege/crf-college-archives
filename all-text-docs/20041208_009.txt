Practical jokes increase on campus

A string of practical jokes has spread
across campus in recent weeks. No one
is quite sure who started it, and their end
is not in sight. Campus safety also seems
to be impotent in preventing them or
apprehending students who have com-
mitted them. Said Campus Safety officer
Jim O'Brian, “The spontaneous and co-
vert nature [of a practical joke] makes it
very difficult for us to predict or respond
to quickly.”

The first practical joke incident was
reported to O’Brian two weeks ago. A
student living in the Belk dormitory
phoned into Public Safety complaining
that a rat was in her room. Officer
O’Brian quickly responded to the call,
and found that the rat in question was
sitting on the student’s laptop com-
puter. The student reported that it had
been sitting there for the last 30 minutes
when she had returned from Field
Hockey practice. Shortly thereafter, the
officer discovered that the rat was actu-
ally made out of rubber and had been
placed there as a “practical joke” to po-
tentially scare or arouse some other
emotion in the victim.

After that initial report, the practical
jokes seemed to appear at an exponen-
tial rate. That same week, Public Safety
had reports of several dozen more prac-
tical jokes. The practical jokes ranged
from lighthearted pranks, such as one
student who walked around Patterson

Court “photographing” students with a
fake camera that actually squirted water
in the eyes of those whom he was “photo-
graphing,” to more

serious vandal-

flashed on and streamers and confetti
were flying everywhere. David got me so
good, there wasn't really a hearing at all!”

. The practical
jokes have spread

ism, such as
someone spray-
painting large
mustaches on the
Chambermaids.
Jerry Skinner
‘07 recalled a
practical joke that
one of his fellow
hallmates, David
Harrison played
on him. “I got an
email saying I had
to report before
the Honor Council
because someone
had observed me
copying a paper
from the
Internet,” said
Skinner. “I was
very confused be-
cause I had turned
that paper in a
month ago. But I
went to the hearing
anyways. When I
arrived none of the lights were on in the
room. At first I thought I was in the

wrong room, but then suddenly the lights

Sensitivity considerations lead to “Red Bikes”
name change to “Community Bikes”

Davidson Outdoors has
announced that due to the
changing political climate
around campus, the “Red
Bikes” have officially been
renamed “Community
Bikes.” The official an-
nouncement came last Fri-
day afternoon when head of
Davidson Outdoors, Bill
Crooms sent an e-mail to all
faculty and students. The e-
mail stated: “Due to popular
outcry and a change in the
philosophical direction of
the Community Bicycle pro-
gram, we have officially
changed the name of the
program from ‘Red Bikes’ to
‘Community Bikes.”

This change has come at a
particularly crucial time in
the Community Bike pro-
gram. Davidson Outdoors purchased
many new bikes in the last two years,
most of which were yellow agd not the
traditional red color. Some students
think this is the reason for the name
change. “The reason they’re called ‘Com-
munity Bikes’ now, instead of ‘Red

Many of the formerly red community bikes have been
replaced by yellow bikes such as this one.

Bikes,” David Martin ’07 said, “is that
they aren’t all red bikes anymore.”
Other students, however, contend that
the reasons for the change are far more
political. Erin Jones ’05 believes that the
name change came due to pressure from
certain politically active students. “There
has been pressure on Davidson Outdoors

to change the name ‘Red Bike’ since they ,

first began the program,” Jones said.
“Some students feel the name is degrad-
ing and completely not politically correct.
The fact that they started getting bikes of
other color and changed the name does
not surprise me.”

The push for more politically correct
names around campus is one that is not
new to Davidson College. For example,
First-Year Students were once know as
“Freshmen” until the Dean of Students
office officially had the name changed in
order to avoid discrimination. Along the
same lines, the competition among First-
Years during Orientation was officially

renamed this year from the
“Freshmen Olympics” to
“Baker Night,” in order to
avoid offending the ancient
Greeks. Finally, the Commit-
tee on Minority Affairs
(COMA) was renamed in Oc-
tober to the Diversity Coordi-
nation Council (DCC) be-
cause many students and fac-
ulty felt that the name COMA
was offensive not only to
coma victims but also to mi-
norities.

More instances of renam-
ing seem to be in store for the
future. The Satellite Parking
lot is currently under debate
as whether to change its
name .o Auxiliary Parking or
not. The worry is that the
word “Satellite” may be in-
fringing upon NASA’s rights and may
give the parking lot unwanted connota-
tions. In addition, if popular support
brings the Outpost back, its name may
have to be changed so that students from
rural backgrounds would not have their
heritage improperly referenced.

Some students refuse to acknowledge
the change in name of the Community
Bikes, though. Robert Gilmore ’06
stated, “I'll never call them ‘Community
Bikes.’ To me, they'll always be ‘Red
Bikes.’ This is just some more of the PC
crap that they force down your throat all
the time nowadays. Some official name
change can’t change what’s in my heart.”
Heather Smith ’05 compared the name
change to that of the West/Tomlinson
building. “Some students still refuse to
call West by its new name, Tomlinson.
For a lot of people it’s not because they’re
against the principles behind the name
change, but rather, they are just so used
to calling it by its old name it’s too diffi-
cult to change.”

Patterson Court as

well. According to

sources, a baseball
player fell victim
to a practical joke
at a party last Fri-
day night. The
student, who was
reported to be
mildly — intoxi-
cated, danced at
length with a fe-
male in the Phi

Delta Theta frater-

nity house. He

then took her back

to his dorm room

where he_ was

startled to learn

that the “girl” was
actually a football
player, and fellow
fraternity member,
who had dressed in
women’s clothing in
order to trick the stu-
dent.

Even the faculty has been getting in on
the practical jokes. Jack Stevenson ’06
said that his Econ 101 professor told them
in class on a Wednesday that their review
scheduled for Friday would be a take-
home test instead that was due Monday.
“When we got to class on Friday, though,”
Stevenson said, “the professor was hold-
ing a stack of papers in his hands and had
this odd grin on his face. He said, ‘Got
you!’ and then passed out the tests. I
couldn’t believe that we'd been tricked by

a professor!”

Not all the practical jokes have been
successful, though. One anonymous stu-
dent claimed to have attempted a practi-
cal joke in the Vail Commons last week. “I
had one of those stink-bombs in the little
glass vials,” the student said. “I pretended
to be perusing the cuisine on the chef's
table and then smashed it down over by
the entree line. I went and hid behind the
crates full of glasses and watched for

everyone’s reaction. Unfortunately they
were serving Durango Beef and Cheddar
that day, so no one noticed the smell.”

So far, only one student has been ap-
prehended for a practical joke. The stu-
dent, who will remain nameless, was
caught placing banana peels and fake dog
poo on the steps of Chambers. It was later
discovered that he had taken the bananas
from Vail Commons. Despite this, and
perhaps due to the increased tensions of
the approaching final exam period, prac-
tical joke incidents are still on the rise and
don’t seem to be slowing up.
