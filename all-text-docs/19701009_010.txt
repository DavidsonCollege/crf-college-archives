The trip was by no means
all ruins and museums. A
Stay at the Riviera was
sneaked into the schedule.
But meeting another world
of people _was the education
that really counted.

‘Powell: Most of the Greeks
spoke at least a little Eng-
lish. L.got along with them
better because. they seemed
not as sophisticated in the
Western sense.

There was time for breath-
taking sights, a different
‘kind of beauty, and count-
less activities.

Affeldt: Crete — the moun-
tains and olive trees were
beautiful. And there was- a
chapel in Florence that was
all marble,

Gandee: Delphi is one of
the most beautiful spots in
the world.

Powell: The Phaliron
Yacht Club in Athens was
an interesting place I went
to, and maybe the Acropol-
is. I even went boar hunt-
ing in Turkey.

as possible,” claims its state-
ment of purpose. ‘‘We have
attempted to present courses

which are both meaningful '

and realistic.”

Girls from Queens College
in Charlotte have often at-

invited to attend.
One of the classes is for
those who have had some

. experience in FORTRAN pro-

gramming. It is designed to

‘be an introduction to the use

of the college’s new FOR-
TRAN computer. The class
will meet forthe first time
next Monday at 4:00 p.m.
in Chambers 212.

The other class is for peo-
ple who ,have had “no pro-
gramming experience what-
ever, and will meet Wednes-
day at 4:00 p.m. in Chambers
212.

Both of these informal
courses will meet once a
week, the schedule to be fix-
ed at the initial meeting.

THE FUN BEGINS AT

ATTIE'S

“just up the roa

two more options which will
be raised before long,”’ Be-
van said.

“One of the best points of
the system is its flexibil-
ity,’’ he said.

‘Students would tend to
leave their extended studies
option until the third term
of the year,’’ Bevan said.
“So we have to schedule a
certain number of projects
to the first and _ second
terms, so that not all stu-
dent will back up on the
third term.”

Five committees, covering
the four academic areas
plus an interarea commit-
tee, were set up to admini-
strate the details of the pro-
gram.

‘Headed by assistant pro-
fessor of English Charles
‘Cornwell, the Area I (Lang-
uage, literature, and_ the
arts) committee includes fa-
culty members A. S.. Ab-
bott, Frank Bliss, Dirk
French, Herbert Jackson,
Thomas Rogerson, Hallam
‘Walker, W. H. Welsh and J.
S. Winkler, as well as stu-
dent member Dick Hinson.

The commiitee for Area II
(religion and _ philosophy),
chaired by religion  profes-
sor A. J. McKelway, as well

as George L. Abernathy,

Daniel D. Rhodes, J. J.
Young and sophomore Ken
Jones.

The Area Ill group (natur-
al science and mathematics)
includes chemistry profes-
sor J. M. Fredrickson, chair-
man, R. B. Bernard, E. E.
Brown, Nick Burnett, W. F.
Frey, J. I. Hopkins, W. T.
Lammers, Jerry A. Roberts,
and senior Tom Opie.

Leading the Area IV com-
mittee (social sciences) will

Charles E. Ratliff Jr., and
assisting him will be J. T.

and sophomore Gary Long.

Bevan will head the Area
V (Interarea group), which
includes Hansford Epes, Jon
Fuller, Ralph Gable, Max
Polley, senior Gene Early
and_sophomore. Mike Wheel-
er.

Bevan said he has been
meeting with the chairmen of
the committees, drawing up
additional ‘plans. for the im-
plementation of the system.

“This program is just. get-
ting started out,” he said.
“We plan to evaluate its ef-
fectiveness at least every
year, and modify it according
to need.”
