Wildcat Coach Takes
Pessimistic Attitude

Disappointed in Showing Made
Against Elon Eleven

“My highly touted fast backfield
turned out to be nothing but Pittman,”
was the statement made by Coach
Doc Newton, when asked what he

thought of the Wildcats’ performance |_

against Elon last Saturday. “We will
be doing well to hold Carolina to four
touchdowns.”

It may be that the disappointment
of. the coach over the showing his
gridders made against the Christians
has made him a little pessimistic. His
predecessor, Monk Younger, was given
to issuing statements like the one

above. Newton, barring accidents, will
be able to present his full strength
against the Tarheels. Mackorell, who}
was unable to participate in the Elon
contest, will be in good condition by |
Saturday. Wingfield, who has been|
suffering from a bad shoulder, will be)
in the Carolina game. These two |
should bolster up the strength of the)
Wildcat backfield. The remainder of
the team is primed for the Chapel Hill
affair.

Newton is working this week in an
attempt to stop up the holes in the!
line, through which the Elon defensive }
men came almost at will. It is prob- |
able that the Davidson mentor will |
start the same line that he put into the |
game last Saturday, except that Potter |
will probably start at Cathey’s guard. |
The Barium Springs boy played a fine |
defensive game against Elon. Siewers |
will hold on to the disputed tackle po- |
sition, but Johnston, Ross, and the|
other tackle candidates will get thee
try.

end runs against what is probably the|

six lettermen. The result of the game/
will depend to a great extent on the
outcome of the clash between the lines
of the two institutions.

The squad in the Wildcat camp has
been working on the plays which, with
two exceptions, were not used against t
Elon. Newton expects to bring an ar-
ray of plays against the Tarheels which

have not been scouted.

After a light scrimmage today, the
"Cats will take a _ short
Thursday, and will leave Friday for
Chapel Hill. '

Tryouts Held: For
Concert Orchestra

Will Be Limited to Thirty Mem-
bers With Ten Violins

Initial tryouts for the Davidson
College Concert Orchestra were held
last Thursday afternoon in’ Chambers
Auditorium, under the direction of Mr.
J. C. Pfohl, new head of the college

‘ music department. The ability of the
woodwind and brass instrumentalists
was more or less known through their
part in the bands, conséquently they
did nothing more’than turn in their
names as interested. About ten vio-
linists reported for the tryout, and the
greater part of the afternoon was given
over to arranging them tentatively in
the order of their ability. The list
of members is not complete as yet,
however, and it will be limited to thirty
players so as to keep the orchestra in
strict instrumentalism in order to ob-
tain good balance.

The effectiveness of the orchestra
will be hampered somewhat due to
the lack of the ‘larger orchestral in-|
struments such as the ’cello and string |
bass. However, the material looks |
very promising and with a good deal
of hard work should turn out well.

Concerning the aint of the orchestra,
Mr. Pfohl has this to say: “This or-
chestra will play only the best in mu-
sic, being entirely separate from the
college orchestra. During the course
of the year it is my desire that the
orchestra shall give several perform-
ances on the campus as well as appear |
in nearby cities.” |

The orchestra will have its rehearsals|
on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons,
at the hour designated in the practice
schedule which appears in this issue
elsewhere.

M. E. Hicks Will Give
Shooting Exhibition

A free exhibition of plain and fancy
shooting will be given by Mr. M. E.
Hicks, world famous marksman, at
the Mooresville show grounds on
Thursday the 28th at 3:30.

This exhibition will] include a re-
markable number of difficult feats with
rifle, revolver, and shotgun. Also a
lecture on the practical and safe meth-
ods of using firearms.

How to develop your marksmanship
and how to become an expert shot will
be shown by this famous marksman.
The purpose of this. free program. is
to demonstrate the accuracy and effi-
ciency of the Peters brand of am-

Concert Orchestra

The College Band, under the direc-
ion of Mr. J. C, Pfohl, has already,
within the limits of its short exist-
ence, made a fair bid to a prominent
place in the musical life of the college.
The band is composed of about forty
members of the R. O. T. C. Band with
the addition of about ten men not tak-
A group fur-

five musicians, forms what is to be
known as the Concert Band. All of

these, in addition to the Glee Club, the
Concert Orchestra and private lessons
on the organ, are under the care of
Mr. Pfohl.

The Concert Band will give several
band concerts throughout the course
of the year. The college is standing
the expense of a great deal of new
music and racks, and with this added
equipment the band should make much
progress. Mr. Pfohl says that the ma-
terial: is good, and the men seem in
earnest with their work.

The men who have shown unusual
instrumental ability, and upon whom
the formation of the band rests are:
James Crooks, sousaphone; Andrew
Cunningham, trumpet; Bradley Har-
ris, clarinet; Ed Johnson, trombone;

Hubert Morris, French horn; H. Park-
er, baritone; John Robinson, trom-
bone; Tom Ross,.baritone, and Frank
Tucker, sousaphone, A more complete
list of the band is not available at this
time since the tryouts that determine
the player’s status have not been defi-
nitely passed -upon,

A schedule showing the practice
hour of these and the other musical
organizations appears elsewhere in this

Professor John Thompson Brown,
for 20 years head of the English de-
partment at Winthrop College, in Rock
Hill, S. C., died at his home September
11 after a lengthy illness which had
prevented him from teaching since last
March,

Gordon Wood will be asked to take
the position of General Division Scout
Master.

Besides these organizations, a man-
ual training shop will be held in Da-
vidson to teach the boys the use of
tools and how to use their hands and
make practical things. Sid Marsh will
help to a large extent here.

In the way of athletic teams there
will be a football team from Cornelius,
two teams from Davidson, and two
Mill Chapel teams.

Here is an opportunity for many Da-
vidson men to get into active Y. M.
C. A. work. Upperclassmen as well as
Freshmen interested in this type of
work may get into line by seeing Sam
Nickey, and are urged to do so as
soon as possible.

dom until sudden changes are made in
the Indian’s mode of living.

Mr. Graham then went on to ex-
plain their shortcomings.- The people
of India have that which is known as
the “outcast group” who are not rec-
ognized by the general class of peo-

[the women are in the minority, are
uneducated, and have no_ privileges.
There are over 500 women now beg-
ging on the streets of India. TIlliter-
acy is also blamed for India’s lack of
freedom. Ninety per cent of the in-
habitants are illiterate. The people are
superstitious- and some worship this
way. The speaker concluded this part
of the lecture by saying, “If the de-
votion of this tribe could be changed
for something worthwhile, it (India)
would be an asset to humanity.”

Mr. J. Reid Graham explained in
the conclusion about the progression
of Christianity in India, The people
are being taught self-respect; educa-
tion is gradually, becoming a major
part; the numerous diseases are being
checked as hospitals have been built;
and the principles of Christianity are
being explained in the schools.

Work of clearing away debris of
the burned Wait Hall was started last
