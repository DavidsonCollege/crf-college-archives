Yearbooks to arrive soon #@ mate

Delay in production pushes Quips and Cranks back -

By ANDREW PRESTON
Staff Writer

During the past few months,
students have wondered why the
yearbooks have not arrived. Year-
books are usually delivered after
summer break, but various circum-
stances have delayed its produc-
tion.

As former editor Amy Liz Betz
states, “The new delivery system
is the best ... I apologize that the
book has not arrived yet, but ev-
erything possible has been done to
insure a successful book.”

The delay in production was
not caused by any specific prob-
lem but by acombination of things.
A major contributor was that “ex-
perienced staff members were
scarce and failed to produce at
crunch time,” Betz explains.

Creating a yearbook is a large
time commitment, and although
there are many enthusiastic volun-

teers at the beginning of the year,
participation dwindles as classes
and other activities arise. There-
fore, Betz “was personally forced
to undertake many assignments

‘which were not initially my re-

sponsibility.”

A second major reason for the
delay in production is simply that
the yearbook is of a higher quality
than in past years. Along with the
traditional features, this book
promises to have a theme (which
will remain a secret), as well as
articles and identification of stu-
dents in candid photos.

All of these features take time
to perfect. As Betz argues, “We
could have quickly thrown together
a bunch of class pictures and
candids ... without making the
book visually interesting or includ-
ing any copy ... that would not be
fair because the yearbook is in-
tended to last a lifetime.”

As a former editor, Betz feels

that the general problem is simply
that the yearbook is too much work
for only a few people to accom-
plish. Editors are not given any
guidance on how to produce the
book, but they are advised with
publishing companies.

As Betz states, “ All I was told
as editor was how much money we
had and where our room was.” She
admits that she enjoyed creating
the yearbook but could have used
more assistance.

Although there is not anexact —

date for the arrival of the yearbook,
the book is nearing completion and
should be out soon.

Betz asks students to “please
respect the efforts of fellow stu-
dents who took the hours of time to
work on the book.” Betz also en-
courages those “students who are
really concerned about the delay to
offer current editor Lida Fitts as-
sistance with the 1996 book, as she
eould definitely use the help.”

A child’s eyes glaze over as Santa hears
the mile-long wish list .., ah Christmas.

Another popular spot during
the event was Ben and Jerry’s, .
which was being frequented on
Thursday night by five-year-old
Bill Heaton and his family. Bill
was enjoying a vanilla ice-cream

cone with sprinkles and on his way
to seeing Santa.

“T want a Panther football for
Christmas. They are my favorite
team, and Kerry Collins is my fa-
vorite player,” Heaton said. This
was Heaton’s first time at the fair.

The’ Davidson Elementary
Student Council set up a conces-
sion stand on the Main Street side
of the Davidson library. On
Wednesday night they sold hot
chocolate Wednesday to help raise
money for the school. Tyler Knox,
Mayor Knox’s grandson who is a
sixth grader at Davidson Elemen-
tary was decked out with a sand-
wich board to advertise the cocoa
and said the three-day fair was
“pretty cool.”
