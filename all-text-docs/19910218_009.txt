THE DAVIDSONIAN ~

OPINIONS

MONDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 1991 9

By Brian Jennings '91

As student solicitor, in the
past year I have served on every
honor council trial and investi-
gated possible violations brought
to the Dean of Students office.
Through this experience and
through conversations with nu-
merous people about the system,
Ihave come tothe conclusion that
something is severely wrong with
Davidson’s “most cherished in-
stitution”. The structure of the
honorcouncil needs to be changed
to a more democratic form.

- Throughout the campus there
is a negative viewpoint associ-
ated with the Honor Council and
the system in general. Over the
past year, I have asked people
from different groups around
campus (fraternity and. eating
house members, independents,
freshmen, and faculty) about their
impressions of the system.

Wrongly, the council is often
perceived asa group of conserva-
tive headhunters, waiting to kick
someone outof school. From this
stems a negative attitude towards
both the council and the system.
However, most of the people that
Ihave talked with would not want

imagine if elections were held for
local juries and these few people
were to hear all cases? In this
scenario, jury elections would
become very politicalandnodoubt
anytime someone was found guilty
it would be blamed on those few
ple elected to the jury. Al-
ough elections for council
bers are not very political, the
vision of the council as an exclu-
Sive group remains.

The Honor Council consists of
just three representatives from the
sophomore class, six from the
junior class, and nine from the
senior class. Why should we limit
ourselves to such a select group to
decide every case? Why shouldn’t
anyone who wants to participate in
the system atleast have the chance

. todo so?

After giving the situation much
thought and looking into honor
systems at other colleges, I think
that the election of council mem-
bers should be eliminated and
replacéd with a self-selected jury.
Those that wanted to participate in
trials would have the chance and
those who do not want to would
not have to be bothered.

to do away with the Honor Code,
they just feel that the way that itis
set up is bogus - and they are
right!

I see two reasons for this
negative attitude. First, if people
hear ofatrial or of someone being
kicked out of school, they usually
do not know the full story but
only that of the defendant. . The
majority of honor trialsareclosed
which is a decision made by the
defendant. Everyone involved in
the trial signs a confidentiality
statement saying that he/she will
not discuss any of the proceed-
ings outside of the court.

~ The intent of a closed trial is
to protect the defendant; how-
ever, the end result is that the
council is viewed as a secretive
group that does not want anyone
to know what they are doing.
Unfortunately if the defendant is
found guilty, he/she often tells
friends that he/she was screwed
over by the council. Rumors get
started, council members have
pledged their honor notto discuss
cases and thus can not defend

false accusations, and people are.

Dean of Students office could be
put into a jury pool. This new
larger council would then select
the Chairperson and Secretary as
the present council does. Also, as
in the present system, the Chair-
person would direct the trials and
the Secretary would select the jury
making sure that no eating house
or friendship conflicts occurred
between jurors and the defendant.

The benefits of this more
democratic system are numerous.
Enlarging the council to a jury

pool would give anyone the possi-

bility of serving on a trial if he/she
wants. More students would have
the feeling that they are a part of
the honor system as opposed to
something that is enforced upon
them. Also, students would think
more about their own honor since

.. they would be making these deci-

sions.

The system is supposed to
operate on the guidelines that prece-
dent is not to be followed in any
trial. However, after a council
member has served on numerous
trials, I think that it is difficult for
‘thatpersonto holistically approach
a suspected violation as a separate

cil member has served on related

most part the Davidson commu-
nity is ignorantof what goes on in
a trial and how they are run. En-
larging the council would edu-
cate more students on the opera-
tion of the system. The miscon-
ceptions of the council would
disappear after more students
served on trials and were more
Closely involved with the system.

Somecritics of amore demo-
cratic council feel that allowing
anyone to serve on a trial would
decrease the caliber of decision
makers in the council and that

nate the confidentiality of trials.
One of the college’s attorneys
told the council last fall that
Davidson students are far more
competentincourtsituations than
the average person called up for
jury duty.

If Davidson students have the
intelligence to serve in our gov-
ernmentscourts, then why would
we be unable to serve in our own
school’s judicial system? As far
as confidentiality goes, why
would any student who is not on
the council be less confidential
than the present members?

Anyway these cries ofincom-
petence and lack of faith in the
student body are mostly made by
present council members afraid
of loosing their positions.

Others say, if it’s not broken

then don’t fix it. Still, Davidson.

should not be afraid to re-evalu-
ate its honor system and make
changes which would give more
students a greater sense of con-
nection with their own honor. The
large number of students present
atan open trial last month makes
me feel that there are a lot of
people in the community who
want to participate in the system
but are shut out by our elective

The long list of candidates in
the Dean of Students’ office for
the upcoming election also points
to this desire. Let us not be so ir-
responsible that we let a few
people make all of the decisions
in honor trials. A self-selected
jury pool would put the honor
system in the hands of more stu-
dents, eliminate some of the ne-
gativeness associated with the
current system, and bring more
students closer to their own sense
of honor. We are all part of the
honor system at Davidson and
each us of should have a say in its
operation.

I propose that the SGA holda
forum on studentand faculty opin-
ion of the honor system and cre-
ate a questionnaire for students to
make suggestions for a better
judicial system.

Why Is Our Student
Paper So Liberal?

reading acopy of the Davidsonian.
I knew he was a perspective be-
cause he was there with Mom and
Dad who were touring thecafe as if
it were the Smithsonian. He was

if gays make him uncomfortable,
feminists drive him crazy, and he
will be going to college on an
ROTC scholarship? What if he
actually likes President Bush?
What if he only dates girls who’
shave their legs?

He’d probably read ‘the

good thirty seconds that there is no

decides to attend, he doesn’t want
anyone to remember that he is the
dork whose parents made a scene
at the Union Cafe. Obviously, he
hasn’theardof Parent’s Weekend.

Anyway, the point is; I was
watching this kid read our paper.
He looked like a pretty normal kid.
Like Joe Davidson, as Sara would
say. He was wearing a flannel,
jeans, duckboots. I could see him
at PIKA, KA, SAE, witha drink in
his hand, enjoying his. freshman-
hood. He wasn’t the kind of guy
Dad warned me about, but as he
put down his paper for a few
moments and surveyed his sur-
roundings, I could see he wasn’t
one who spend [sic] all his time
studying either. He looked cocky,
like the freshmen do first semester,
and I smiled. He was Joe Davidson,
all right.

I wondered what he thought of
the school. Then, all of.a sudden, I
got this panicky feeling. I wanted
torunoverand grab the paper from
him. What would perspective Joe
Davidson think about Davidson if
he read our paper?

‘Well, he would wonder if there
was aplace for him here. He would
wonder of he could have a happy
existance [sic] at this institution,
being the heterosexual, non-femi-

liberal institution. What he would
never get to see is that most of us
are notasliberalasthe Davidsonian
writers. Most of us are like him --
Jane and Joe Davidson. ‘We share

Davidson. We do have scveral

a militant feminist/homosexual or
a liberal idealist with a mission to
save the world, there is no column
for you. Eighty percent of .
Davidson’s student body have no

. voice in the Davidsonian.

I’ll probably never know what
that kid thoughtas he and his eager
parents drove home. If he’s here
next year, I’m sure I won’t recog-
nize him; he looks like a hundred
other guys here at Davidson.
Maybe he would have been an
SGA senator, an athlete, union
worker, the President of his class,

.a brother in a fraternity. Ill never

know. There’s one thing Idoknow,
though. He would have never writ-
ten an editorial for the Davidsonian.
The paper would be the only place
on this campus where he wouldn’t
fit in.

Opinions:

Read The Davidsonian, The South's Foremost
College Weekly and say, "The world is a
really big place, I mean, look at how far
away that tree is,” or "Old MacDonald had
_ a farm," or "We should have let sanctions
work,” or"we should nuke everything that
is evil and not like us," or,."Look, J.C. Pen-
ney's is having a sale," or "Jesus love me
this I know," or whatever, and write it
down in letter and send the letter to The
Davidsonian office and french fries and large
Coke please and if you have any questions
or comments call David "Pundit" Scott at
x6615. He wants to help you.
