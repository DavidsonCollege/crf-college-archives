Blue Devils outmuscle Cats 69-52

By ANDY BARRON

Any students who chose E.H.
Little Library and their books over
the Davidson-Duke game in Char-
lotte will be relieved to know they
made the right decision. David-
son’s 69-52 loss to Duke will be
remembered as a game where no
one seemed to be doing what they
should have.

Duke, third-ranked in the na-
tion, looked like they would rather
have been doing something other
than playing Davidson in basket-
ball. Duke’s lack of enthusiasm
could have been exploited by the
Wildcats thereby turning the game
into an upset, but it wasn’t to be.

Davidson looked starstruck.
The Wildcats played with plenty

of enthusiasm and intensity, but
missed too many easy shots and
made too many bad passes to beat
East Tennessee State, much less
Duke.

Most importantly, the referees
seemed intimidated by Duke’s
players, coaches and _ national
ranking. To say the referees called
a loose game would be an under-
statement. The minimal use given
to the referees’ whistles made it
look like they were looking for
their NFL yellow flags to throw at
all the penalties that flashed be-
fore them.

For basketball fans, last
night’s game was pure agony. The
referees never had control of the
game and inconsistency ran

Student support

encouraged

By MIKE ADAMS

Men’s _ basketball = coach
Bobby Hussey and fourteen stu-
dents have formed the “Fast Break
Committee” to encourage support
for the Wildcat basketball team.
The committee has scheduled sev-
eral halftime activities and a raffle
of a television to promote atten-
dance at home games.

Junior Connie Clark, who
chairs the committee, said its pur-
pose is “to rally support and inter-
est in the Davidson basketball
team.” Attendance is the key issue
for the committee. “We really
want students to go to the games,”
Clark said.

The Fast Break Committee is
attempting to promote attendance
through a variety of halftime ac-
tivities. Tentatively scheduled
events include “King of Pizza”
night on Jan. 9, the Benji Hill
Juggling Act on Jan. 11 and a
“Dash for Cash” on Feb. 3.

In another promotion the com-
mittee will raffle a television at the
last home game. Students attend-
ing home games can register in a
designated.area between 6:45 and
7:30 p.m. At the end of the sea-
son, those students who have at-
tended the most games will be-
come eligible for the raffle of a
19” color television.

Cats dominate
UNCC 49ers 68-53

By DARRYL BEGO

To put it bluntly, Davidson
dominated UNCC last Saturday in
Charlotte.

“If we control the boards, we
control the tempo of the game,
and ultimately the outcome.”
Davidson proved these words by
senior Jim McConkey true as the
Wildcats combined rebounding
and a patient halfcourt game to de-
feat the UNCC 49ers 68-53.

UNCC controlled the opening
tap and raced to an early 4-0 lead
on goals by juniors Mike Milling
and Keith Williams. But the Cats
charged back with. eight un-
answered points, on goals by
junior Chris Heineman, McCon-

key and two from senior Ken

Neibuhr.

After the lead shifted back and
forth for sometime, Davidson
took a 21-20 lead on a nifty Gerry
Born lean-in bankshot. Born also
drew a foul from UNCC’s Mike
Washington, sending himself to
the charity stripe. The Cats would
never trail again, as junior An-

thony “Ace” Tanner made up for
Born’s missed free throw with a
crowd-arousing, follow-up dunk.
This provided a spark, because
moments later another Bom
jumper, a Heineman bomb, and
the Cats went in at halftime with a
28-22 lead.

The first half was basically an
unproductive one, but it was not
lacking in intensity. Both teams
played tenaciously and their
halftime shooting percentages ex-
plain their scoring deficiencies.
Davidson shot 46.2 percent and
UNCC merely 31.3 percent.

Davidson's first half momen-
tum carried over into the second
half as the Cats scored a couple of
easy lay-ins, but not till after the
49ers made a run at Davidson
themselves, Narrowing the
halftime margin to 36-32. A hook
shot by 6'11” UNCC center, Ray
Gromlowicz, and consecutive
baskets by guard Rodney Abrams,
sent coach Bobby Hussey motion-
ing for time-out.

After the time-out, the Cats

amok.

It would be a lie to say Duke
won because of poor officiating.
Duke outshot, outrebounded and,
most importantly, outscored
Davidson throughout the game.
Duke won because even when
their offense sputtered, their
tough man-to-man defense pre-
vented Davidson from making a
run.

Duke looked like they were
going to run away and hide when
they blew to a 24-8 lead with
seven minutes left in the half. The
Wildcats never gave up, however,
and fueled by strong bench play
from senior Ken Niebuhr and
sophomore Todd Scott, scored

eight straight to make the score
24-16. The rest of the half was
even and the halftime score had
Duke ahead 33-25.

Early in the second half,
Davidson cut Duke’s lead to six
and appeared ready to make Duke
sweat. Then the referees helped
kill Davidson’s upset by ignoring
the street-fight that developed in
front of them.

“Duke was bigger and
stronger and the physical play de-
finitely didn’t help us,” coach
Bobby Hussey said. “We really
got by the foul trouble our players
got into (Senior Gerry Born and
Rucker fouled out for Davidson).

They played great defense. I think
we could have played better and
I’m disappointed that we didn’t.”
Duke finally ran away for
good in the second half, but
though the Blue Devils won by 17
points, Davidson played Duke
much more evenly than the final
score indicates. Himes led David-
son with I1 points and the
Wildcats got great play from
Niebuhr and Scott, who played his
best game to date at Davidson.

Davidson has yet to play any-
body that wasn’t a pushover in a
rebuilding year or in the highest
reaches of NCAA basketball.
Over the break, Davidson finally
plays teams in the middle ground.

Anthony “Ace” Tanner flies on Air Tanner for the easy way to the basket

seemed to be pumped up, espe-
cially Heineman. It was Heine-
man from 23 feet and then 18 feet
from the corner. He sparked the
Cats with his outside shooting and
opened up the Cats’ inside game.

Heineman said: “When I got
the ball, a few times the defense
would stay inside and leave me
open. I knew that if I would hit a
few jumpers it would eventually
open up our inside game.”

Open up is just what the game
did, for the once close 36-32 early
second half score, leaped to a 46-
36 margin with 10:47 left to play.

The 49ers would never get closer
than nine points for the remainder
of the game, as the Cats spread
their offense and forced the 49ers
to foul them. a

The keys to the game were the
Cats’ rebounding and ball control.
McConkey said, “We were fired
up to go to the boards because we
knew it was a very important part
of our winning.” McConkey, who
had seven boards added, “We
have a play in which we burst into
the lanes and hope to get a long re-
bound after a missed free throw or
shot.”

The game ran Davidson's re-
cord to 5-1. The win was impres-
Sive as everyone on the team was
involved and contributed. Senior
guard Pepper Bego said: “Every-
one helped out. Behind the
scenes, those who played little in
the game contributed substantially
by encouraging the first team to
work hard. Also, the fan support
was great.”

As far as the UNCC game is
concerned, as sophomore center
Mike Gynn puts it, “Nothing more
should be said, but, take a glance
at the scoreboard.”
