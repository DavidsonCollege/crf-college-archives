Just like the Davidson of yore

Welcome to the Davidson
College of yore. Beer on the decks.
Beer on my floor. Beer in people’s
hair. This is what I remember,
though only vaguely—it was along
time ago,

Man oh man, do I miss it. I
wonder where it all went to. Actu-
ally, I know it went to my head,
which has a lot to do with why Iam
still here. Unfortunately, I have a
lot of experience with the parties
of yore (I just love saying “yore”.
And, based on that, I have to say
you people’s parties suck. Equally,
unfortunately, there doesn’ t appear
to be any blurry sun on the horizon.
The moon has risen, and there is no
music playing underneath it.

And whose fault is that? Well,
Ican’trightly say, but itisn’t much
fun getting angry with some stupid
law makers and _a general public

ner to buy anything but a good

ents. After all, college is designed
to prepare you for the future. God
knows we spend enough time here
Studying things that have abso-

obsessed with the idea
of gaining riches
through law suits. The
peopleIcan blame, how-
ever, are those who are
yet to recognize the ben-
efits of the “bring your
own beer” party.

When we outgrow
traditions

A discussion of the church-school
relationship at Davidson

: Some traditions should be cov-
eted. Traditions outline the blue-
prints of who we are and what is
expected of us. Traditions mold
our identities. But Davidson trust-
ees, members of the administra-
tion, Dr. Kuykendall, hear my plea.
Stop the inane tradition that all
Davidson trustees have to be of a
Christian faith.

I almost did not come here.
One reason I feared this commu-
nity was the rule that only Chris-
tians could be trustees. I am not
Christian, and will never believe in
what my religion views as the pleas-
ant poetry of the New Testament.
However, even though I do not
follow all the Christian precepts, I
am not empty or without the moral
strength that religion often pro-
vides.

It disheartens me to think that
I arrived on this campus with a
disadvantage; I can never be a
member of this community to the
full extent.

Davidson was founded by
Presbyterians, I know. Christian
ethics imbue the social and moral

codes of this school with strength.
I do not deny that. But the cata-
logue touts a diverse (growing more
diverse) student body, which means
more students are arriving from
backgrounds other than Christian
and from homes far from the Bible
Belt. By excluding these students
from ever becoming woven into
the Davidson tradition beyond their
graduation, you are robbing this
community of the richness the ad-
missions office toiled so long to
establish.

What is it you fear by chang-
ing this statute? By keeping it, you
stand only to lose. Davidson, you
hail yourself to provide a strong
liberal arts education. Without a
board of trustees reflective of the
many facets of this community,
you sacrifice the school’s new char-
acter; you inhibit your students
from receiving a true, broad, lib-
eral arts education.

Abandon this outdated tradi-
tion. Allow a board of trustees that
celebrates the uniqueness and char-
acter each of us may provide,

whether we be Christian or not.

You can handle it. Trust me,
in the real world there is no free
beer. Unless, of course, you live at
home and steal it from your par-

money left over to pay
those greedy little police officers
unwilling to work past two unless
they are paid enough to buy them-
selves three new cars every year.

I have heard there will be let-
ters to the editor in this issue ask-
ing where are the college directo-
ries, possibly in response to last
week’ s call from “El Jéfe” to “shoot
the people in charge of the college
directory.” The answer: they are
here and probably already distrib-
uted by the time this issue of The
Davidsoniancomes

trade-off people would like? I’m
not sure, but I may try that next
year in an effort to pick up a little
more time.

The directory is one out of
more than 500 printing jobs we
handle every year, and it comes
toward the end of our busiest pub-
lishing season. Every year we look

information people want is avail-
able well before the official direc-
tory is published.

This year’s directory is the
most complete we have ever had:
photos for all but two people out of
688 current faculty and staff listed,
and for the first time ever, voice
mail listings for students and e-
mail addresses for

out. And they are
right on schedule.
Our job jacket files
from the past four
years show the fol-
lowing delivery
dates: October 14,
1992; October 19,
1993; October 14,
1994; and October
19, 1995.

Why is this late

We will make every effort to
improve the printed publication and
to speed up the process to get it
delivered. But based on 10 years of
experience publishing it, my best bet
is that you will see next year’s
directory toward mid-October 1996,

In addition, all

date the expected
detivery schedule? First, we can-
not publish until we get all the
information we need, including off-
campus addresses and phone num-
bers for students and updated pho-
tos and information from faculty
and staff. And we cannot get all
the information we need and
double-check it for accuracy until
mid-to late-September every year.
We do final layout and formatting
and get the job to the printer every
year around the first of October.
Second, the printer needs
about two weeks (which is both
standard and reasonable for a job
of this scope), then the job is deliv-
ered and distributed around cam-
pus. I could save a few days by
. switching from plastic comb bind-
ing, which is more labor intensive
and must be done one at a time, to
saddle stitching, which is both
cheaper and faster. But is that a

for ways to speed up the informa-
tion gathering and checking pro-
cess for the directory and every
year we end up frustrated when we
can’t seem to make that happen.
There is a trade-off here: we could
publish earlier and knowingly in-
clude inaccuracies and missing
information. But I consider that to
bea greater evil among my choices.
Soevery year we follow this sched-
ule. And that is why about seven
years ago The Davidsonianstarted
publishing student phone numbers
in their first issue of the year. The
information is incomplete and in
some cases inaccurate, but is a
tremendous boon to the campus
until the final directory can be pub-
lished. I hope The Davidsonian
continues this practice. In addi-
tion, the Residence Life Office
publishes a limited number of tem-
porary student directories. So the

from two or three
years ago to see the difference.

The next major evolution of
the directory will come once the
entire campus is networked with
fiber optic cable. Then the direc-
tory can become a “living” elec-
tronic document available to ev-
eryone online 24 hours a day, 365
days a year. At that time, we may
be able to eliminate a printed ver-
sion entirely.

Until that day, however, we
will make every effort to improve
the printed publication and to speed
up the process to get it delivered.
But based on 10 years of experi-
ence publishing it, my best bet is
that you will see next year’s direc-
tory toward mid-October 1996.

Andif this is not good enough,
well then, go ahead and shoot me.
Make my day.

Some times I think I would
welcome the firing squad.
