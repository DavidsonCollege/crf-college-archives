LICK V.M. I.
TENNIS EXHIBITION

HERE |

It looks like a little rough work is just what the Cats need-
ed, for after a pretty hard week’s session, including two partic-

ularly strenuous afternoons with the freshmen, the boys were

no doubt improved.

On the other hand, there’s no doubt, too, that hard
practices sometimes cost more than.they’re worth. Last
week, Ben Frank Moore was the only practice ‘casualty,
but there may be more, if the heavy work keeps up. Still,

from the looks of the team as a whole Saturday night, it

looks like the chance is a good one to take. There seemed

to be the feeling that everyone knew what he was to do and

that he could do it, particularly on offense, and the rather

weakened squad went on to score twice as many points as

any other Davidson combinations had rolled up all year.

Purples moved them consistently, but on passes the backfield

had plenty of time, and if they didn’t pass, there were holes.

The Hurricane

Going over on to the other side of the field, there’s no
doubt anywhere, but that Dewey Proctor is a GOOD back.
He had the holes and the downfield blocking, but he kept
going after he was hit, and after his blockers had left him
in the manner of a big-league ball player, and the disap-
pointingly small crowd of 7,000 could see why he took the
All-state fullback honor away from Clemson’s Charley
Timmons. Jim Barnett and Strings Sizemore also did their.
part, but it was that husky, powerhouse line, headed up by
Cahlie Edens, Hazel Gilstrap, and Chum Cornwall that real-

ly turned the trick.

It looked at first, as if the Cat’s five

man line had them fooled, but when the second period got
underway, they’d solved the problem and got things mov-

ing.

Davey Spencer’s passing and running kept the fighting Cats in

Davidson, determined to rack up
their first win by upsetting the fa-
vored Purples, drove to a smash-
ing touchdown early in the first
period. Davey Spencer, engincer-
ing the march, mixed plunges and
passes to perfection. The pay-off
came on a pass which Shannon took
on the two and stepped across the
line. Frederick converted and! the,
Cats led 7-0.

Offense Clicks

Although Davidson’s offense
clicked beautifully for the remainder
of the fray and they never quit

fighting, McLeod’s proteges packed

just a little too much brawn and
deception. The Purple’s line, vir-
tually ineffective on defense, ripped
the Cat wall wide open and ‘Proc-
tor, Barnett and Sizemore opened

the throttle as they went through.

Furman Scores

Furman drove for a pair of
touchdowns in the second stanza,
featuring hard running, then Jim
Elvington connected with a 30-yard
field goal and the visitors grabbed
a 16-7 lead and stayed ahead the
