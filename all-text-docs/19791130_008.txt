The 1979-80 edition of the
Davidson Swimming Team
should be highly competitive
and is expected to finish in the
upper division, possibly as high
as third, at the Southern Con-
ference Championships.
Considering the veteran make-
up of this year’s squad and the-
positive effects of an off-season
-weight program, such optimism
seems well-grounded. Also,
Coach Pat Miller’s spirits. have
been buoyed up by the addition
of two quality divers, Frank
Bright and Charu Sharma, to
the Davidson program.

Strength in the distance e-
vents along with the points in
the diving competition will cha-
racterize the team’s effort this

Coach Miller is the first to
admit that freestyle sprints will
be a weakness, but she sug-
gested that Beck and Finger,
two of the squad’s more versa-
tile performers, could be shifted
depending upon the competition
to compensate for this weak-
ness.

Pre-season conditioning has
gone well and all the swimmers

They won’t have to wait long
because an away meet is sche-

which includes such schools as
Washington & Lee, Wake Fo-

Roller coaster season for soccer team

To say the Davidson College
Soccer team finished their 8-13
season with a bang might not
give the team the distinction it
deserves. Davidson finished the
season by going 2-1 in the final.
a tenacious, spirited game, the
3-1.

Psyched. for the season’s last
game against the archrival Tar-
heels, the Wildcats put on a
display of good soccer with
Mental lapses cost Davidson
‘two goals late in the first half
and another early in the second
half before the Cats returned to
their level of good play.

“We played them close the
whole way,’”’ said coach Karl
Kremser, “and they’re one of
the best teams around. He

i praised the play of
senior fullback. Pete Sluiter,
who kept Davidson in the game
with his saving tackles and long
throw-ins. Jimmy Hawk scored
Davidson's only goal.

The preceding weekend Da-
videon hit thé road and game
day, November 9, against Wof-
ford, the Wildcats beat the
NAIA Tournament-bound Ter-
riers 4-2.

The team then pushéd on. to
Tennesses to play UT-Chatta-
nooga. Davidson won 8-0 in a
poorly played game against a

first year team. Barnett scored
twice, as did Wall, one a
penalty kick. Chuck. Price, a

starter all season, finally got

one in the net, and Cup Coffee
scored his first career goal.
Tom Schember and Nichols

added Davidson’s other tallies.

In a roller-coaster season,
Davidson's soccer team showed
great improvement, said Krem-
ser. Despite their 8-13 finish, it
was still their best record in
many years.

Football season ends mercifully _

By DAVID DONALDSON

their 1979 football season in a
first eight games the ‘Cats were
6-2 and looking for a playoff
berth. However, losses to Fur-
man, 63-55, and Wofford, 48-
28, ended the season at 6-4.
That was, nonetheless, the first
winning season since 1969.
Before the visiting 1969 Tan-
gerine Bowl team and “several
thousand other fans, Davidson
and Furman staged a record-
setting offensive show. Their
combined 118 points broke the
old record of 111 and David-
son's 55 pointe were the most
ever scored by a losing team.
Though not a record, the teams
did combine for 1123 total yards
which was quite an exhibition of
offensive football,
The records were important
enough to warrant Devidion a
in the weekly foot-
ball column of Sports Illus-
trated and Coach Ed Farrell’s
quote, ‘‘I thought 55 pointes
would have been enough,” was
listed in SI's “They Said It”
column the following week.
Davidson then played Wof-

that was not to be the case as a

fired-up Wofford team subdued -

the Wildcats 48-28 for their
homecoming fans. The game
was a sloppy mess after heavy
rains had fallen the previous few
days and the Wildcats never
really got untracked. The of-
fense produced four touchdowns
but failed to take advantage of
numerous other scoring oppor-
dled with injuries and was never
able to stop the Terrier attack.
Davidson ended the season
with some fine standings in the
national Division I-AA statis-
tics. Alvin Atkinson finished
second in scoring, GiffordPiercy
was second in pass receiving,
and the ’Cats were fourth in
total offense, second in passing,
and second in scoring offense.
seem bright despite a more
difficult schedule. Alvin Atkin-
son, Ray Sinclair, and Gifford
Piercy all return in an offense
that will be spearheaded by
Brian Whitmire. Also, David-
son’s young defense will have a
year of seasoning Lehind them.

Although plagued by
inconsistency, Davidson's cross
country team finished with a 7-5
record, one of the best in the
school’s history. Captains Bart
Landess and George Strobel led
a talented squad that, although
finished a disappointing eighth
in’ the Southern Conference
meet, combined their efforts for

_ some important victories.

“No individual really stood ©

out,” said team member John
Hoots. “It was a team effort the

whole season. Everyone got.

along well and it made for a
good season and a great experi-
ence.”

As well as Hoots, Landess

and Strobel, the top seven

runners also included Jeff Mor-
row and Jack Smith. Danny
Armistead, although hampered

c Cross country cruised

by an injury received during the
Lynchburg race, showed
marked improvement and also
contributed to the overall suc-
cess of the team.

In a program such as David-
son’s, the stress is on education
and enjoyment of the sport with
winning a secondary concern.
Although the team was con-
cerned with coach Norm Kol-
ler’s failure to receive tenure,
his strong leadership united the
team. ——_- - -

In a sport usually equated
with individual effort, David-
son’s cross country unit was
able to unite for a team effort
with a different stay at every
meet. The prospects look good
for next year, and with an effort
matching the '79 teams, David-
son could have another success-
ful season of cross country next
year. .
