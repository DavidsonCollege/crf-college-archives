With The Other Colleges

Units Dedicated

Cleveland Plain Dealer, Dec. 12.—The
first unit of the new Notre Dame Col-
lege, Green Road, South Euclid, was
dedicated recently by Bishop Joseph
Schrembs of the Cleveland Catholic
Diocese. Alumni of two generations
and the present student body attended
the exercises and young men and wom-
en representing schools and other ac-
tivities were in line of march through-
out the corridors.

The building is of English Gothic de-
sign. It is located in the center of a
campus of 55 acres. Additional units
will be added as the necessity arises.
The inner material is a reinforced con-
crete. The surface  briage-crossed,
trimmed with special sandstone. The
interior finish ‘conforms to the outer
design. Light gray carthage marble,
with imported rouge lumi base is the
first floor finish. Terazza work is set
on all upper floors. The wall, in special
Gothic: plastic, are ornamented by
niches and cornices.

There is a need for a greater num-
ber of high schools and college so that
Catholic principles may become more
thoroughly a part of the mental and
spiritual equipment of the coming gen-
eration, Bishop Schremb declared.

and will be increased during the
Spring session, when about one hun-
dred more foreign students are ex-
pected to enter. By the end of the
year almost seventy-five countries. will
be represented.

What Price Education?

New York Times — The to-
tal expenditures for public education
in the United States in the past eigh-
teen years have increased 230 per cent,
and the end of this upward scale is
not in sight. Professor G. D. Strayer
of Teachers College, Columbia Uni-
versity, an authority on the financing
of education, declared in delivering the
principal address at the closing session
of the University of North Carolina’s
first annual Southern Conference on
Education,

He contends that while the need for
educational expansion continued to be
urgent, the rapidly increasing wealth
of the country proved that education
was a highly profitable investment.
As a result of the continued and rapid
increase in the income of the people

Capt Otto Is Head
Of Fire Department

On Wednesday morning, December
5, the various companies of the R. O.
T. C. battalion were assigned their
duties as a Fire Department. The
Fire Marshal of the fire-fighting unit
is Capt. J. A. Otto, and his assistant is
M. M. King. The following duties
were assigned to the companies in case
of fires on the campus or in the town
of Davidson:

Company A will procure the hose,
chemicals, and ladders and proceed to
the fire. Company B will take charge
of the buckets and follow Company A
o the fire. Company C will be respon-
sible for guarding fire plugs and water
ines, and for regulating traffic. Com-
pany D will report to the Fire Mar-
shal for the purpose of salvaging and
guarding property from the burning
building and adjoining buildings. The
band will sound fire call, and a de-
tachment» of eight men will carry a
stretcher to the scene of the fire in
case of an emergency.

At’ the regular afternoon parade last
Wednesday, December 5, the first
platoon of Company A was given first
place. The second platoon of Com-
pany B came second, and the first
platoon of Company C was awarded
the third place.

Company B is now leading the bat-
talion in points, with a standing of
ten points. Company A and Company
D are tied for second place with nine
points each, and Company C is third
with seven points.

Band Uniteen-Fund
Is Rapidly Growing

Money for the outfitting of a college
band is already being collected or do-
nated to Captain J. W. Elkins. The
total sum through Monday, December
10 was $160. Plans are being made.to
have quite a bit of the money come
through interested persons and ‘the
remainder to be earned by the mem-
bers of the band.

The amount necessary to properly
outfit the band is» approximately nine
hundred dollars. This sum will include
caps and capes which add a great deal
to the looks, and snappiness of an or-
ganization. There will about 45
men in the personnel and these men
will not necessarily be taking R, O, T.
C. The men are to be chosen from the

be

best musicians in the school and wilh

have regular formations.

As announced in this paper last
week, the first public call for aid will
be made at the basketball game in the
gym which is with Furman on January
9. This call will be made to the stu-
dents to contribute to the fund. A
quota will be assigned to each class
as a goal and the individual members
will work toward that end.

A large number of the professors in
he college have already signified their
ntentions of contributing to the fund.
One sum of fifty dollars has been se-
cured by Captain Elkins and it is hoped
that quite a bit of the money will have
been gathered before the re-opening
yf school after the holidays. Donations
are rather expected from alumni in the
towns where the band has appeared in
their R. O. T. C. uniforms for football
games or other occasions.

A plan is now under foot whereby
the band itself may aid in increasing
the fund. Each year the permission
to sell drinks, peanuts, candy, and oth-
er commodities at athletic events is
given to the Students Store or a
worthy student. The plan is to get
permission for the band to have charge
of the concessions. This would aid in

at least a small way to attain the goal.

The main purpose of having a uni-
formed band 1s to have them furnish
music for all athletic events. They will
also play for any meetings or conven-
tions near Davidson which might re-
quire their services. The need for a
colorful band has long been seen at
Davidson but has just reached the
point of necessity. Consequently ,
Captain Elkins has been placed behind
the movement and will have charge
of the fund. :

“Globe trotters”, we can imagine Dr. Freud as
saying,“‘are people whose nurses dropped them
onto an escalator in early childhood. They buy
a sun helmet, a guide book, and a first-class
passage to the Pyramids, and are never heard
from again.”

Nevertheless, the most confirmed voyageur

thrill at finding a carton of

Chesterfields in a tiny cafe on the Left Bank,

or a package of the same on a card table at
the Army Club at Simla, or on meeting an Arab

For Chesterfield’s popularity never saw a sun-

Such popularity must be deserved—and it IS!
