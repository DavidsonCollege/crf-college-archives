Three things about
Davidson had been kept
inviolate since its founding:

the Davidson Monthly editorial-
ized on the horrors that lay in wait
for both sexes on a coeducational
campus. The young women’s
constitutions would not be “able
to bear the mental strain and fa-

of health to the time when they
were in college.” The male stu-
dents would find their subjects
bereft of many subjects “unfit for
a joint study by the two
sexes....For instance, our classics
would have to be pruned” and

the students enjoyed arguing the
question, some feeling that in
such a small town... we must
necessarily fall into careless hab-

sarily lose sight of the little

Others boosted Davidson’s ad-
vantages, “a magnificent build-
ing, well furnished society halls, a
beautiful campus, pure water,
good society,” and all this in “a
village free from temptations and
enjoying the advantages of a city
as far as church, mail, telegraph
and railroads are concerned.”
The threat to the college’s
name was more serious.
“Davidson” told people nothing
about denominational ties, and
stressing denominational ties was
very much in the minds of the
trustees in early 1885 as they set

committee planned “to
consider the propriety of chang-
ing the name of. Davidson Col-
lege” and the new charter, ratified
on March 4, 1885, specifically
gave to the trustees the right to
change Davidson’s name if they
wished. In June the executive
committee suggested that the
board “consider whether it would
not more favorably impress the
general public if the name were
changed to “The South Atlantic
Presbyterian University.” The
trustees declined to make the
change, giving no reason, and
Davidson survived the nineteenth
century with name, place, and sex

‘unchanged.

As if the Depression and foot-
ball were not enough, Dr. Lingle
also had to contend with dancing.
At a Presbyterian college in the
1930s, dancing was still an emo-
tional issue on which honorable
men could disagree, and did.
Davidson’s trustees, citing a
General Assembly statement that
dancing was “not a wholesome
form of. pleasure for Christian
people to engage in,” recognized
the “impropriety” of allowing the
students to ignore this viewpoint,
and had drawn up a resolution as
far back as May 1918 reminding
fraternity members-:‘with great
kindness, and yet with great ear-
nestness that the Board of Trus-
tees cannot approve of dancing on

. the Campus or in connection with

the College in any way....”

It is easy to imagine their cha-
grin upon seeing the front page of
the Davidsonian for March 19,
1919, with its long article on the
beautiful and elaborate St. Cecilia
Club dance given in Charlotte on
March 10, featuring “spot-light
effect waltzes” and jazz pieces.
The faculty promptly adopted
new regulations noting that
Davidson was an “instrument of
the Presbyterian Church” and
“subject to the rules and regula-
tions of the Church Court,” and
that forthwith “the existence of
any organization in the College
whose.avowed purpose is to pro-
mote dancing is forbidden.” Goo-
dby to the St. Cecilia Club, whose
“flagrant violation of these rules

discredit upon the College in the

“unanimous rising vote” cil

of Concord Presbytery on Sep-
tember 17, 1919, affirmed . the
presbytery’s “condemnation of
the dances of today as a moral and
spiritual evil,” and praised
Davidson’s trustees “for the ef-
fectual prohibition of this sin.” As
President Martin saw, however,
the prohibition was easier to pro-

because you get to see, slowly but surely; a
project develop and you know that at the end
of your work there’s going to be a family
that’s going to be able to live in the house
and be part of the community. I really don’t
see any downside. It’s a very positive proj-
ect.”

Volunteers and the homeowners perform
virtually all of the necessary tasks, such as
the recent installation of acommunity sewer
system. According to Randy Kincaid, a
board member and co-founder who deals
primarily with the project’s finances, “Not
only have we built a house which will bene-
fit the family directly, but it’s been a won-
derful exercise in community building to
bring together students and townspeople,
both town and gown kinds of people, in an
endeavor that all of us can get behind. I think
it’s really been marvelous.”

He adds, “It’s nice to have continuing
volunteers rather than one-shot kinds of

' people so the people can bring back the

skills that they learned. Money is hard to
raise and it’s:slow. I would like to think that
the students might even get involved, for
example, in raising money.”

Patrick Osborne, who is in charge.of con-
struction and performs what he calls “qual-
ity control,” says he notices a lot of conver-
sation going on between people while they
work. “It’s a relaxing time to get to know
different people really well in a working
environment. I think it’s good for the com-
munity, and it’s real good for the college
faculty because they all seem to know each
other pretty well and all (are) friends when ~
they come over here.
