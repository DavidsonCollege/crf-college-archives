FHlomecoming frt volity: a weekend on film

By LAURIE BALLENGER

Homecoming means different
things to different people. HA!
How’s that for meaningless
drivel? To many it means an
exhausting, exhilarating weekend
of parties, games, and too much
consumption of too many sub-
stances (food, alcohol, pick your
favorite vice). To others it means
a quiet, well-planned weekend of
contemplation and moderation.
Will the ten people who can claim
that please step forward?

Since I didn’t attend every
party, dance, or game (shameful,
but true, although I tried), I wan-
dered the halls collaring poor

helpless individuals and threaten-
ing them with grave physical in-
jury if they didn’t give me a quote.

On Friday many students went
out to dinner. For most this en-
tailed going to Charlotte and, as
everyone’s favorite junior Barry
Clark put it: “Sowing out.” Some
boys were amazed at how much
their dates could eat. From
freshman John Coleman: “As
soon as she looked at the menu my
date’s eyes glazed over and she
could only whisper ‘food’. She
threatened to go back in the
kitchen and help fix our appetiz-
ers. It was frightening.”

Back at the castle, a mellower
crowd settled in the 900 Room to
listen to the jazz sounds of
Cathexis, while others congre-
gated at band parties on the Court.

On Saturday the. good souls
who were conscious’ at noon
trooped to the soccer game to
cheer the. Cats on to victory.

Freshman Jay Barron described
the game as “. . . intense. It was
great to see everyone meeting old
friends and just generally having a
good ole homecoming weekend.
But people were still paying atten-

tion to the game. Each goal re-
ceived what had to have been a
five-minute standing ovation.”

The football game: sunshine,
sunglasses and seeing everyone.
Guzzling Cokes, gobbling hot-
dogs (more food!) and having
post-mortem discussions of the
night before. Wondering how
anyone can wear a Wildcat cos-
tume and not pass out from heat
exhaustion.

After the game: more parties.
When willit all end? A bonfire out
in the middle of the Court. Mibs
Raney reflected on this event: “I
haven’t had S’mores since I quit
girl scouts (all the Brownies were
mean to me — that’s why I’m like
I am now.) They were incredible,
(the S’mores, not the Brownies)
of course, chocolate isone of the
dominant pleasures in life. I liked
the fact that the dress was casual
as compared to all the semi-for-
mals.”

About 9:30 people started
wandering over to the dance.at the
Commons. Lauren Russell was a
bit confused: “I walked
i . Why were all those people
staring at the dance? Is this a
dance or a dive-over-the-railing-
at-the-Commons-party? I liked
the band but the extra crispy chic-
ken nuggets left a lot to be desired.
Of course, I’d eaten beaucoups at
Eli’s (I may never recover from
the peanut butter pie!) I liked the
way they set up the dance with the

_ bandon one side and tables where

you could sit atid talk on the other.
That way it wasn’t so loud that
you couldn’t hear yourself think.”

More parties. More exhaus-
tion. The weekend finally ended.
AW! But smile evilly and cherish
the thought: there’s always next
year. Oh, who cares, there’s al-
ways next weekend!
