Sophs and Juniors Do Battle’ nected with the college and all friends

With King Cotton

Well—Seniors This Week

"Twas on Tuesday, the 30th of Sep-
tember, 1919, that the sophomore class
of Davidson College sallied forth in the
early hours of the morning to do battle
with Old King Cotton.

They arrived on the scene of conflict
early and were soon regaled in the hab-
iliments of war. At once they began to
vie with each other who should be in
the lead when the battle would finally
be declared won. And oh! how the
white fleecy staple did fly! Wagons
were on the scene of conflict and were

continually bearing off that which had

been annihilated.

The colonel was here and there and
everywhere, encouraging, exhorting and
persuading to keep the good work go-
ing.

‘Dinner hour was celebrated in high
glee, the boys having it in picnic style.
Then to the afternoon grind. Oh! how
those backs did ache and those knees
wobble. Many ‘were the recourses to
the elixir of life contained in the can-
teens, and the rests under the trees be-
came more and more frequent. But
finally after ages of struggling 5:30

came and the Soph. cotton picking day |

passed into history. But the reporter
feels honor bound to mention two or

three things the Sophs. did which met |
the approval and congratulations of the

whole student body. G. N. Neel, of
this class, picked two hundred pounds,
the highest record yet, and the whole
Soph. class averaged = seventy-four
pounds per man.

The Juniors picked the following
Thursday. They went with jest and
laughter, but alas, like all their predeces-
sors, they returned grouchy, sore and
tired. One squad went out and return: |
ed with signal honors, its men having a
round average of ninety-one pounds per
man, while they didn’t pick the gross
amount the Fresh and Sophs did, yet
the Juniors made a very good average.

So now, Seniors, you are the only ones
left. The three lower classes have made

records for you to equal. You must up-’'

hold the honor and might of '20 and
‘we are expecting you to do it. All con-

CHAMBERS FORGING AHEAD.
| SHOWERS BEING INSTALLED.

The usual afternoon bathrobe parade
from Chambers to Georgia and Watts
will soon be discontinued, since the
work on the new showers for the north
wing Chambers is nearing completion.
The boiler and piping have been here
for several days and are almost ready
to be put in place.

The boiler is to be on the first floor
and a shower on the other floors. This
improvement is one that was much
needed and it will add materially to the
comfort of those rooming in North
Chambers. The inmates of Georgia
and Watts will also be thankful when
the work is completed, for they will
have a better chance at a hot bath.
