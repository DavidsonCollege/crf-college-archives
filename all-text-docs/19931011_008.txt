OPINIONS

MONDAY, OCTOBER 11, 1993

I would like to start this article by pos-
ing a few questions. Does your stomach
ever get queasy when you seeatelevangelist
whack someone over the head and say, “Be
healed by the power of Jesus?” Do bumper
stickers that read “In case of rapture, this car
will be unoccupied” bug the hell out of you
(no pun intended)? Does the term “born
again” make you think of some Bible thump-
ing, civil liberties restricting, self-righteous
fanatic ready. to sentence you to eternal
damnation? If you answered “yes” to any or
all of these questions, please continue read-
ing. And if you didn’t, well, you have
nothing else to dositting on the toilet, so you
might as well read the rest of this article.

In writing this article I do not wish to
ridicule anyone’s opinions or beliefs. Iam
also not going to preach to anyone. (God
knows this happens enough on this cam-

Move beyond the stereotypes and

cliches of Christianity.

pus.) I would just like to explore the nature
of cliches and stereotypes involved with the
Christian religion and attempt to dig deeper
and see if any “truth” can be found.
Webster’s defines cliches as being “any-
thing that has become trite or commonplace
through overuse.” With such a definition, it
would seem as if Christianity itself has be-
come one big cliche constructed of many
smaller cliches. Because of overuse, I can
understand why phrases such as “my walk
with the Lord” or “being born again” have
lost meaning for some and become threaten-

ing to others. (Personally, whenever anyone
asks me how my “walk” is going, I fell like
answering, “Well, Ikind of plod from side to
side and I think that I look too stiff.”)

In keeping with the practice of dictio-
nary quoting which seems rampant in the
opinions section, Webster’s defines a ste-
reotype as “a simplified and standardized
conception or image of a person, group,
etc.” Although we are all guilty of some
form of stereotypical amplification, I still
feel that any form of stereotype, whether it
is racial, religious, or political, robs an indi-

vidual of his or her innate human dignity.
Just something to think about the next time
we have the urge to call someone a Bible
thumper, feminazi, tree hugger, Mr. Charlie,
or nigger.

OK, so where is the truth or even the
Christianity in this article? Since I do not
claim to possess the truth, I will only try to
point in its general direction. Do you ever
just sit and look atthe stars and think “Wow,
I wonder how they really got there?” Or
have you ever just sat and laughed with a
friend, just because you enjoyed each other’s
company? Do you everjustclose your eyes,
empty your heart and mind of even the
concept of your self as an individual and just
passively or serenely melt into existence
itself? If you haven’t done these things I
encourage you todoso. Who knows what or
whom you may encounter?

Blame it on Texas: Suzanna Young

Why can't country
musicians dress well?

This week the world was wit-
ness to the greatest night in coun-
try music.

No, it was not Garthmania ‘93
(and thank God it’s over. Now I
can listen to the radio in peace.
Finally. The concerts sold out so
quickly because every radio sta-
tion in the tri-state area bought all
the tickets so they could start giv-
ing them away in June), but the
27th Annual CMA Awards.

That’s Country Music Asso-
ciation, if you can’t figure it out.

The show is an array of vari-
ous amazing performances and
tributes, a few awards, and also a
chance for country music stars to
show their off-stage personalities
or, in the case of Reba McEntire,
who showed a little more than just
her personality, to show what coun-
try music as a whole just can’t do,
which is dress.

What was up with that outfit,
Reba?

The CMA started out with one
strike against them in the area of
fashion when someone forgot to
coordinate the co-hosts, Clint Black
and Vince Gill.

First of all, Clint is eae

five-foot-ten with his boots on, and
Vince is a'prétty big boy. -

Also, Clint, who can do no
wrong as far as I’m concerned,
appeared from the left, neatly

dressed in a tux jacket, jeans, and

his trademark black hat.

From the right side, out lum-
bered Vince Gill in a retro-seven-
ties smoking jacket, which didn’t
exactly fit with his Jason Priestly
wanna-be hairdo, and definitely
clashed with his dimpled co-host.

I don’t know what statement
the CMA was trying to make, but I
assure you that not everyone in-
volved in country music is color
blind. |

Perhaps the most talked about
event in the whole program was
George Jones’ acceptance of the
award for Best Vocal Event for “I
Don’t Need Your Rocking Chair.”

The catch here is that George
didn’t exactly accept the award in
person because he was in the bath-
room when the award was pre-
sented, as his wife, Nancy, so
thoughtfully informed the audience
while the rest of the free world
watched via satellite.

My theory is, however, that
while the other artists who helped
George record the song, which
pretty much cleared out every
dressing room in the theater, were

on stage to accept the award,
George was backstage writing in
Vince Gill’s name as winner of
every award he was nominated for.

That has tobeit, because Vince
won way too many awards for any-
one with such bad taste in clothes.
Besides, his songs all sound the
same.

Then there was Tanya Tucker,
exposing her six-pack stomach to
the world once again.

I have heard that Tanya has
been hired to lead a workout video
called “Abs of Steel," set to many

‘of her greatest hits and in the spirit

of Cher’s best selling “Buns of
Steel”.

My only question is why?

Again, I have a theory.

You see, Tanya is on the road
a lot and probably doesn’t eat a
balanced diet. Well, noteating right
can sometimes lead to, well, ir-
regularity, which, in turn, can lead
to extreme discomfort and some-
times affect the brain.

The best part of the CMA
Awards, besides George Jones’
rendition of “Hello Darlin’,” in
honor of the late, great Conway
Twitty, was the order.

Itwastruly incredible thatboth
Garth Brooks and Billy Ray Cyrus
(my apologies to Billy Ray for that
unfair grouping) were both sched-
uled to perform during “Melrose
Place.”

So they can’t avoid a simple
and obvious fashion faux pas, but

. they sure know how to get their
timing right. CES ee Oe aan

Say what you

believe.

Say what you believe.

I wrote that sentence in a pre-
vious article in September, but
because I was focusing on another
issue, I could not describe in great
detail exactly what I meant. What
was I implying in that statement?
Many injustices exist in this world
because we. simply do not look
within ourselves for answers.
Much of what we accept as com-

pletely normal is probably in actu-
ality, unjust and unfair.

Forexample,

sight to realize our society’s ineq-
uities. Therefore, you may ask,
how can we perceive what is un-
just and evil? Though we are all
influenced and possibly indoctri-
nated by beliefs and standards since
birth, we can discover truths by
questioning ourselves. Though we
all have a set of rules and morals
that we have learned, some of these
standards may be outdated or pos-
sibly unjust. Most of our values
and opinions were conceived by

ordinary people:

I remember
speaking with a
couple (about my
parents age) who
lived in Georgia
in the early 1960s:
they recounted

"Some of the beliefs
which we accept
as completely
normal must be
incorrect."

and we all know
that humans are
certainly not per-
fect. Therefore,
some of the be-
liefs which we
accept as com-

that when they

went into the city and hadtouse the
rest room or drink from a water
fountain, they would always search
for the sign displaying the word
“whites." If the “blacks” would
ever have dared to drink from the
forbidden fountain, they would
have been criticized, ridiculed, and
possibly even arrested. In our age

of Political Correctness (PC), it.

may seem shocking that such in-
justices occurred; but according to
this couple, many law-abiding citi-
zens never questioned these stan-
dards, but merely accepted these
tules as fact.

What frightens me when I re-
call this conversation, is that I can
envision a large percentage of
people in our generation acting the
same if we were placed in such a
situation. Many of us at Davidson
believe what we do is “right”: i.e.,
we obey laws and regulations, do
not steal or cheat, and study dili-
gently so we will acquire a lucra-
tive job. (Iam certainly not saying
that these goals are wrong, but Iam
stressing the fact that we are doing
whatothersexpect ofus). As prod-
ucts of our society, we usually strive
to fulfill what is accepted as nor-
mal. In the same context, many
people in the 1960s assumed that
these laws and rules were just, be-
cause they simply never questioned
the norm. Unfortunately it is very
simple for us to criticize the sins of
the past, for we often require hind-

pletely normal
must be incorrect.

Iam therefore encouraging the
student body as intelligent and in-
quisitive students to think freely.
and independently. If you notice
someone is treated unfairly, try to
muster the courage to voice your
opinion. I read once that almost
every insightful opinion or revolu-
tionary idea that we now accept as
completely normal wasat one time
hated and rebuked. :

To put this in perspective, if
people had never stood up against
injustices, our world would be a
very different place: for example,
Hitler might have been the ruler of
Europe (and possibly the world),
the Jewish race might have been
exterminated, African-Americans
might still be enslaved in America,
and (on a more personal level), I
might not even be allowed to write
this article or study at Davidson, —
because at one time, a woman’s
role was merely “dutiful passive
homemaker.” If enough people
had not realized these aspects of
society were unjust, they would
never have changed. I am not say-
ing we needto speed over to Roses,
buy supplies for protest banners
and march around campus; but I
am saying that as gifted studentsat
a liberal arts college, it is practi-
cally our obligation to analyze what
we have been taught, questionsome
of our own. - beliefs, and decide for
ourselves what is truly right: -"-" |
