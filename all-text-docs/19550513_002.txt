Tribute To A
Managing Editor

Out of the facts and files of the
Davidsonian office emerge many strange
and unusual characters. There is one
type, however, that seems too normal to
be there, too smart to admit it, and too
tired to leave. Upon his shoulders rests
the responsibility of some 5,000 words,
the fate of reporters and articles, and
the ultimate success or failure of the
paper. He is anonymously called a man-
aging editor. As exams dawn upon the
sleeping populace, it is fitting to recog-
nize this unsung hero of the printed page.

The managing editor begins his usual
week on Sunday evening around nine
o’clock with an editorial board meeting
where he receives credit for last week’s
mistakes and lays plans for another week's
paper. On Wednesday evening he takes
head in hand and enters his respective
office in the Union for a long night's
rendezvous with the ‘student voice."
Here he collects the written words, cuts
them to available space, checks for gram-
mar, and waits patiently for “last minute
scoops.” The editorial man must move in
mysterious ways to delete suspicious lines
and damaging paragraphs;-seek out the
creative editorial writers and cartoonists
and avoid such things as “cloister-fobia”
and fifth column columns. For the front
and back page editor there is the constant
struggle with word space, irate presidents
whose 800-word commentaries can not go
in, and the usual! headlines, cutlines, and
deadlines. Then there is always the sports
editor, left without reporters, who col-
lects the facts, applies the established
jargon-expander, and produces page 3 in-
between the ads.

Around midnight, our hero faintly re-
sponds to the Union call, packs up his
folders and moves out. Thursday after-
noon, he strolls to the printing office to
set up his respective page on the iron lay-
out, cut the run-over, and fill up any ap-
parent holes. Friday afternoon also finds
this newsman down among the type, mak-
ing final arrangements for printing, and
proof-reading the entire copy. When the
press begins to roll; he silently returns
to campus life to await the reaction.

A charter member of journalists
anonymous, this unseen but indispensable
editor faithfully carries his page to press
each week. Fifteen hours of work and
many problems find their answer in over-
heard comments and the knowledge of a
printed page. To the managing editor,
then, a tribute long due but never forgot-

| Chapel Policy

The recently announced plans for next
year’s chapel services offer one more ex-
ample of the significant change in faculty
and administrative policy of this year.
Realizing the dilemmas of chapel in the
past, a thorough analization of the prob-
lem was made by a qualified committee.
Acting upon the facts ahd results, they
have presented a plan built around the
policy implied at the first of the year by
Dr. Cunningham in his chapél talk on the
subject.

The central concept of this policy rests
not with the negative elimination of one
chapel service per week, but in the pur-
poses (expressed on page one) which
center around worship and fellowship. It
was recognized that three well planned
and concise services can be more mean-
ingful than four or five routine exercises.
Students were also given the benefit of
the doubt in regard to the number of
cuts in proportion to the number of serv-
ices held.

It is hoped that administrative analysis
and positive recognition and action upon
campus problems will continue and that
student response to these changes will

. bear earmarks of mature southern gentle-
men.

Student Government’s Year
Surveyed In Retrospect

A quick look at the state of
student government at the close
of ,the year shows no sweeping
changes, and no daring innovations
since last spring. Such a look, how.
ever, does show several important
improvements and points toward
further development in the future.

The new student constitution
stands as the main achievement of
the past year’s work. The rework-
ing of student body regulations to-
ward a simpler and more general
statement of infractions gives the
individual students more responsi-
bility for student conduct, while
at the same time giving the coun-
cil greater flexibility in dealing
with offenders. The added respon-
sibility to the student comes in
applying for himself the more
general provisions of the new regu-
lations to varying situations. It
brings him away. from a strict
legalistic definition of offenses.

Amore definite and an improved
trial procedure affords students
standing trial a better chance to
present an adequate defense, and
more safeguards against violation
of what are considered basic rights
in our judicial system. This new
trial procedure enables the coun-
cil to get at the facts of the case
more quickly and more efficiently
through the use of a prosecuting

attorney, all of which leads to a

fairer and a juster decision.

Other provisions In the consti-
tution provide for administrative
changes which should insure a
larger student voice in the admin-
istration of student and overall af-
fairs of the college. I refer to the

Dickie Davis

“Our Year

In the fall of 1951 when the
present senior class reported to
Davidson College as freshmen, we
were soon to grasp the optimistic
enthusiasm that Davidson was em-
barking on a new era in athletics,
The pre-season reports lauded the
new trend, and rightly so, as an
unheard-of eighty-one candidates
reported for early football practicé.
I can remember very vividly the
fact that there were 21 guards and
17 tackles crowding the freshman
field twice a day in preparation
for the opening game. It took only
the opening kick-off, however, to
initiate the class of 1955 to the
defeatist attitude.

Perhaps if Robinson's 85-yard
jaunt didn’t convince some of the
more enthusiastic red capped,
megaphone bearers, and Friday
night’s downpour failed to dampen
the new Davidson spirit, the next
week's victory over VPI was cited
as the real evidence of the new
era. However, as the seasons came
and went, the records could not
be.denied as we came into our
last year.

Football had gone from a 1-8 to
a 2-7, and culminated in 0-9 in
1963—3 wins in three years. Bas-
ketball never suffered the crash,
since no pre-season prediction ever
leaned toward Madison Square
Garden, and baseball lost its pen-
nant hopes with its disastrous win-

new Student-Faculty Committee
and the Finance Committee.

The council has tried to seek
out issues instead of waiting for
them to arise of themselves. In
this line it made a stand at the
first of the year as regards drink-
ing and interpretation of pledged
work. These stands were not de-
signed to antagonize or frighten
anyone, but to state clearly sin
advance what the council's in-
terpretation of these important
provisions would be. The council's
concern over: student attitude to
the Honor System also worked to-
ward this goal of raising pertinent
issues.

In representing student view-
point and opinion on matters of
concern to the student body, per-
haps student government performs
its most important functions.
Much of this work is always be-
hind the scenes—through commit-
tees, conferences, and the like—
but some, such as cutting of re-
views and athletics was done
through formal statements and
petitions.

Another weak point of student
government program in the past,
which has been strengthened is
participation in outside student af-
fairs. Membership in the National
Students Association and partici-
pation in the state student legis-
lature should enable Davidson to
be active in state student affairs in
the future, as well as affording an
influx of new ideas from these
organizations.

Perhaps the most vital criticism
of our governmental set-up is the

smallness of the base of student
support and the failure, all too
often, of the council to act in any
capacity but judicial. The past
council has tried to avoid these
shortcomings through a program
aimed at increasing both the num-
ber of students participating and
the overall scope of student gov-
ernment work. The council tried
to accomplish this first through
committees composed largely of
council members, such as_ the
constitution committee, and
secondly through more or less in-
dependent committees, such as
Clyde Robinson’s Committee on
NSA membership and Doug Olden-
burg’s committee for the’ proposed
Student Leadership Conference,
which although unable to be held
this spring is to be next fall.
Student government has shown
itself willing and able to take on
the tasks for which it exists. That
it has not done so completely is
due to its own failings and to the

failings of the student body in -

general. In order to prosper in
the future, it must seek out even
more thoroughly for responsibility
—responsibility for administrative
and legislative action, responsi-
bility for representing student
opinion, and responsibility for
keeping students not only informed
but also participaitng in its activ.
tivies. To the extent that this
year’s administration hss failed
to do these things, it has failed;
to the extent which it has pro-
gressed in assuming these respon-
sibilities, it has succeeded.

”.-The Athletic Scene

less season of °53. Only occasion-
ally was evén a minor sport able
to point to its won-lost column
instead of the high academic
standards of Davidson.

Don’t get me wrong. Even if the
1054-55 seasons had been unsuc-
cessful, I still would not be leav-
ing Davidson as a cynic or a skep-
tic. There are the other undisputed
values which we all recognize. My
feeling is that these other values
would have been tripled if we
could have had winning clubs.

We are proud of this year.
Recognizing it could not have
been a success without the other
classes, we still feel that this is
“Our Year.” Every athlete and
almost every member of the senior
class will look back to 1954-55, as
Davidson College looks back to the
year Woodrow Wilson spent here.
Unofficially this was the winning-
est year in the history of the
school. We boast a won-lost record
better than 63%.

We can leave Davidson with our
heads up as far as athletics are con-
cerned. I often wonder how our
friends of the class of ’54 feel about
their last year. Well, I guess we
could leave it with this swan song
of victory and justify a feeling of
pride for salvaging thia senior
year; but I personally can't quite
forget the years of 1061-'52-'53.
We had a string of moral victories

going, and not only were we prov.
ing ourselves good losers, we were
mighty near perfect. Are these days
gone now? I feel that '55 will con-
tinue,to mean what it does and we
will be able to justify the three
preceding years only if Davidson
continues to prove itself in ath-
leties.

Are there any doubts that all
isn’t pointing toward this future?
{ am not alone in my feelings that
the athletic situation does face a
very crucial future. No summary
of athletics for these last four
years would be complete without
a word to our old friend, “sub.
sidization.” We could pass it off
as somebody else's baby, but I be-
Neve that Mother Davidson can
well point the finger of gullt to.
ward us. It is as much ours as
anyone else's. My personal advice
for the rearing of the child would
be this: (1) Take a long and
thorough look at the problem, (2)
then jump in and back enthusias-
tically what ever the majority de-
cides (and for heaven's sake quit
this bickering and get together),
and (3) don’t, then, be ashamed
of our best for with a little appro-
priate publicity we can cash in on
one of our best means of enlist-
ment by pointing to our calibre
of athletes and the successes of

the 1964-65 season. 4!

Intangibles Reflect
Success of Y Program

In evaluating the work of the
YMCA, it is important to remem-
ber that the “Y” attempts to be
a Christian organization, with the
Christian gospel at the core of its
purpose and life. For this reason,
the successes and failures of the
“y” are hard to determine because
they deal with intangibles. The
success of the “Y,” if it succeeds,
lies in the benefit and Christian
growth obtained from the program
by those who work and study in it
and by those who are the recipients
of the “Y" work. If the program
does not attempt to lead those
who have already professed their
faith in Christ to a deeper under-
standing of their Christian faith
and to lead those who have not
committed themselves to a faith in
God through Jesus Christ, then the
“y” has failed.

The University Christian Mis-
ston inaugurated this year, in place
of the usual Fall and Spring
Services, was designed to apply
Christianity to everyday life, using
five speakers instead of one to get
a variety of opinions. The intent
was not to tell the student what
to believe or do, but simply to
make him think about what the
Christian faith demands in every-
day life. It was not intended that
it should necessarily be what the
students wanted to hear, but what
ed

This week is the second in a
series of two in which outstand-
ing campus leaders have presented
&@ resume and evelustion of their
year’s work in veriovs phases of
college life. These articles are pre-
sented in hope that they will be
helpful as the new officers and
their organizations plan for nex?
yeer.

ee
men of known intellectual ability
and spiritual concern felt the Chris-
tian gospel implied. Many students
objected to the series because they
felt both sides were not presented.
This-may have been true, but there
are good points to any side which
ean be absorbed even in disagree-
ment, and disagreement with
another's ideas should help one to
revaluate and clarify his own
ideas. Also, the other side is al-
ready well represented at David-
son, while the side presented has
had little mention.

Another new emphasis in the
“y" was the emphasis on study
groups. This was added in the be-
lief that a person’s faith grows as
he studies the thoughts and be-
liefs of others. Seminar groups on
Contemporary Theology, Marriage
and the Family, and Contemporary
Social Problems were started, as
well as Freshmen Fellowship
Groups. Forums on Segregation and
the Formosan Question were de-
signed once again not to tell the
student how to think but to get
him to think. Study Commissions,
similar to other cabinet posts, on
World Citizenship and Campus Life
were set up to try to make the stu-
dent take more of an interest in
the problems of the world outside
of Davidson and to think more in-
tellfgently on campus problems—
to apply Christian principles to
these problems in looking for a

solution. °

The Negro Community Center,
which was made possible by last
year’s Gift Fund, has been in
operation throughout the year. A
Teenager’s Club was organized
there by the “Y” which has had a
definite Christian emphasis in its

program. Other community work
continues as in the past, as does
Scouting, Boys’ Work, the College
Bible Class, the Gift Fund, Deputa-
tions, and the Student Volunteer
Movement.

There has been an added em-
phasis assumed by the Social Life
post this year. An effort has been
made to provide social activities
which would enhance and enrich
the total personality of the ‘in-
dividual. Special emphasis has been
given to bringing more people into
this phase of the “Y's” work.

An attempt has been made re-
cently to revitalize the weekly Hall
Prayer Meetings. This was
prompted by the meetings on third
floor Georgia and subsequent “Y”
evaluations of this part of the pro-
gram. There is hope that the ex-
periences this year will help to
improve the Hall Prayer Meetings
next year.

Undoubtedly, one of the big
steps taken: by the “Y” this year
was the passing of a new consti-
tution, or to be technically correct,
the substitution of a constitution
of the YMCA in general for the
old YMCA Board of Directors con-
stitution. The main change, of
course, is from automatic to volun-
tary membership. The pros and
eons of this change have been
weighed carefully by many
thoughtful
seems to have foolproof argu-
ments. I only hope that this new
type of membership will ‘prove suc-
cessful. It is more in keeping with
the purpose of the YMCA which
demands a definite commitment
that should be voluntary if it is to
be meaningful. Whether it will
make the “Y” more vital, whether
it will give the members more of
a share and an interest in the
functioning of the “Y," whether it
will strengthen the actual imple-
mentation of Christian purpose in-
to the program and lessen un-
necessary administration and or-
ganization—all of this remains to
be seen.

In summarizing the year’s activ-
ities, it is impossible to overlook
the untiring efforts of Sam Magill.
He has dévoted himself sincerely
to doing the best possible job as
“y” secretary. The YMCA Board
of Directors, under Chairman D.
Grier Martin, has also given much
of its time to serving the “Y,” and
has been extremely helpful in its
advice and support.

What does ail this signify in
terms of success or failure? It
seems to me that we have been
successful in terms of the numbers
partieipating in the various phases
of the program, in the number of
different tasks we have been at-
tempting to perform, and perhaps
to a lesser degree in the service
which we have rendered to those
outside of the college. But as 1
Stated in the beginning, numbers
and organization is not the real
basis of judgment. The success or
failure of the YMCA in terms of
the benefit and Christian growth
of individuals affected by the pro-
gram can only be judged by those
individuals.

I personally have felt that the
Christian purpose has been lost
sight of at times. There is no doubt
that we have failed in some ways.
Particularly have we failed to take
an active stand on vital issues.
I hope, however, that the YMCA
has helped at least some people
and that your sincere prayers will
be with it in the future. I am con-
vinced that the YMCA is a vital
part of Davidson and.that through
the Christian Gospel it attemots
to proclaim is the -most important
thing in life. Only through God's
guidance can it be successful.

The Week’s Correspondence:

HTU-1 Ellyson Field
Pensacola, Florida
9 May, 1955

To the Editor:

I read with considerable interest
the editorial pages of Davidsonlans
for April 15th and 22nd, and noted
all the hullabaloo created by the
recent elections for YMCA presi-
dent. Similar situations have hap.
pened in the past, and they will
probably happen again.

The nomination of a “party boy”
for Y president is something of an
annual practical joke pulled each
year by the “rougher element” of
the student body, as a token of
their dissatisfaction, as a means
of self-expression, and as a re:
minder to all the stalwart pre-
servers of the status quo that per-
haps there are some “cracks in the
cloister.” The situation is always
the same, the personalities in-

volved usually have similar repu-

tations, and the outcome of the
election is always the same.

Has it ever occurred to you
jokesters that your “party boy”
may be interested enough to take
this thing seriously? You sacrifice
him on the altars of laughter and
rebellion, and more or less expect
him to lose. I dare say that io
most cases, if he runs, he really
wants to get in there and do his
best to build a VY that reaches
“party boy” and “holy joe” alike—
a truly campus-wide YMCA.

On the other hand, has it evar
occurred to you winners that your
relatively narrow margin of vie-
tory may indicate that as an or-
ganization, the Y is meeting the
needs of only « little more than
half the student bod:;;? If this is
true, a large part of your task for
the coming year is obvious. What
are you going to do adcut it?

Sincerely

NAT DANIEL, '52.

Action Called For On

Science Curriculum

The proposal to substitute a general
science course in the curriculum in the
place of the presently required physics,
chemistry, or biology course for non-
science students has been discussed at
great length recently. (See the Davidso-
nian, Friday, May 6, 1955.) Indeed, there
are some who feel that the subject has
already been discussed too much. How.
ever, the recent “storm” is not the first
time that this change has been suggested.
At least one candidate for the presidency
of the student body and one editorialist
have advocated the change every year that
this student has been at Davidson College.
The advantages in such a course appear
to outweigh greatly the disadvantages
which have been advanced.

Everyone here seems to favor the plan
except the members of the faculty and
administration. Members of the faculty
actually shun discussion of this proposal
and are invariably opposed to it no matter
what department of the college they are
in. Are the members of the Davidson
faculty not capable of teaching a general
science course?

The one disadvantage of the proposal
and the objection which is cited by those
who oppose the plan is that the student
would not learn a great deal about any
science. This is true, but so what? It is.
not involved formulas and detailed dia-
grams of cellular structure that a student
retains, it is the general principles of
science interestingly and meaningfully
presented to the student that can be of
value to him in his later life. Very few
A-plus students could pass a_ physics,
chemistry, or biology examination if given
to them three months after their final
examination.

An accelerated course ‘would be of-
fered in their respective fields for science
majors.

It is to be hoped that the faculty and
administration will take immediate steps
to include such a course of instruction in
the curriculum for the school year
1956-57. It is probably too late for such a
program to be instituted next year. How-
ever, the program and the idea should not
be allowed to die because of a one year
delay in instituting it. The year may very
profitably be used in selecting textbooks
and allowing professors involved to “bone
up” on ‘the allied sciences and outline
their course of instruction. —T.W.W.

Knight In Subtle
Armor -- A Challenge

Yesterday in chapel, the student body
was privileged to listen to Mr. Pete Me-
Knight, former editor of the Charlotte
News, graduate of Davidson, and winner |
of numerous awards in journalism. The
reaction to his talk on segregation was in-
teresting and informative.

A conservative Carolinian said, “Most
thorough analysis and inclusion of
facts .. .” an Alabama drawl, “Very ob-
jective and fair talk for a Southerner .. .”
a continental Floridian, “Forthright, just
what the South needs.” and then from a
thoughtful element this statement,
“Subtle propaganda. He assumed two
things immediately but so subtly. First,
that the Supreme Court had a right to
say what they said, and secondly, that
what they said was right.”

From the reaction and comments over-
heard, two homilies may be drawn. One,
some become completely overpowered by
the presentation of a speaker. Too often
they pre-judge him on sounds and sight,
losing the possible thought and sincerity
of his conviction. Two, many form an

Opinion, a very strong and vociferous
opinion, from first reading of headlines.
It would be very worthwhile and often
illuminating to explore the problem,
obtain the facts, and analyze sincerely, as
our speaker did, before making rash and
often non-retractable statements.
