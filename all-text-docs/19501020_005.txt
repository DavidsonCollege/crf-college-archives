The freshman cross country team
easily whipped the runners otf
Pheiffer Junior College, 23-38, Tues-
day afternoon for their second
straight triumph.

The great running of Bill Ship-
ley, who has yet to be beaten,
again highlighted the victory. He
set a new freshman record at Da-
vidson by running the two and a

half mile course inl2:025, breaking
the old record by two and a half

seconds, which was established last
year by Clyde Garrison and Bob
Jones of North Carolina State.
The better ability and condition-
ing of the frosh were easily shown
in that seven of the first ten
finishers were Davidson men.

The stalwart, already-famous Ci-

semester.

The Kittens reversed matters the
second half though and had things
their way most of the time. Behind
the passing of quarterback Sid
Cutts and the runuing of fullback
Tex Coulter and halfback Johnny
Grey they threatened several times
but were unable to cross the double
marker until the fourth period. Ci-
tadel was forced to punt after a
Davidson drive failed to produce,
and Coulter a 185 pounder, gathered
it in and, picking his way through
a host of tacklers, raced 35 yards
to score standing up. McCall’s kick
was bad, and the score was 12-6
with about 10 minutes left in the
game. Citadel threatened again late
in the period but was unable to
push it over. Neale Graham and
Bob Loy were standouts in the
line for Davidson while Grey, Coul-
ter, and Rod Harrelson showed well
in the backfield.

Phi Delts,

Last of

Unbeaten,

Knocked from Ranksby Betas

By WALLACE ABBOTT

After only three weeks of intramural toot ball, not a single team remains undefeated. The
Betas Wednesday toppled the last undefeated club, the Phi Delts, 12-0. This fact proves that
there will be a great deal of contention among all the teams for first place in the league. The
teams definitely shaping up as powerhouses are the Phi Delts, Betas, Kappa Sigs and KAs.

Pi Kapps 12-Pikas 0
The Pi Kapps showed a very.
good offense in their 12-0 victory
over the Pikas. Their passing was

sharp as was their defense. The

two touchdowns weve scored by
Hopper Alexander and Jerry Noll.
Although the Pika offense had trou-
ble getting started, it was sparked
by some nice pass receiving by L.
A. Parks.

Kappa Sigs 14. SPE 0

Two touchdowns and a safety
were more than enough to give the
Kappa Sigs a victory in their game
with the SPE’s. The Kappa Sig
line constantly gave the SPE’s a
rough time. Passes to Thompson
and Spach accounted for both Kap-
pa Sig scores.

Betas 2 FD-Phi Gams 0

In a game that was scoreless up
until the last 3 minutes, the Betas
edged the Phi Gams 2.0 on first
downs. Through the entire game
both teams threatened many times
to make first downs, but some
great defensive play halted the
drives. In the defensive lines Lynn
Crawley looked good for the Phi
Gams while Francis Pepper stood
out for the. Betas.

Phi Delts 30-ATO 0
The Phi Delts rolled up the high.

est score of the season to down the
ATO's. It was all the ATO's could
do to keep from loosing yardage
while the Phi Delts just wouldn't
be stopped. Two of the Phi Delt
touchdowns were scored by Frank
Warren.
KA’s 14-Kappa Sigs 12

Even though both lines fought
to a standstill, the KA’s were able
to outsecore the Kappa Sigs by the
margin of a safety. i as pass.
ing and running was, < re again,
the difference. Both Kappa Sig
secures were by Charlton Torrence,
one being on an intercepted pass
covering the length of the field
Ward and Bachman scored for the
KA's on passes from Bird.

Pi Kapps 3FD-SPE’s 2

The Pi Kapps were able to score
their second victory of the week
when they edged the SPE’s 3.2. It
was the closest game played by
both teams so far this year, but
the Pi Kapps proved to be defen-
sively stronger. Bill Cassels played
lis usually fine game along with
Jerry Nall. Mills and Grier looked
good for the SPE’s.

Sigma Chis 6-Pikas 0
Despite the fact that the Sigma
Chi's dropped several touchdown
passes, they were able to eke out a

victory over the Pikas. Both teams
threatened to score several times,
but it was only on a pass from
Tyler Berry to Johnny Kelton that
enabled the Sigma Chis to do so.
In the Pika line Dick Boyd con-
sistently hard charge.

Betas 12-Phi Delts 0

The Phi unable to
overcome the hard charging Beta
line, and so they went down to
their first defeat of the year. Both
Beta touchdowns were set up on
attempted punts by the Phi Delts.
One the kicks went for only
about 5 yards while the other was
fumbled. In the Betas defensive line
Tom Craven consistently gave the
Phi Delts a mean time.
