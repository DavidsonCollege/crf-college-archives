How They Are Kissed
The Brenau girl bows her stately head,
And fixes her stylish lips

In a firm, hard way—and Ict’s ’em go
And sips, and sips, and sips.

The Columbia girl has a way of her own,
In a clinging, soulful way;

She takes a kiss that’s just as big

As a wagon load of hay.

The Converse girl gets a grip on herself
And carefully takes off her hat;
Then grabs the man in a frenzied way
Like a terrier shaking a rat.

\
The Chicora girl just arches her eye,
So cool—so cold—so glum;
She sticks out her lips like an open book,
And keeps on chewing gum.

But the Winthrop girl never says a word,

She's too gentle, timid and tame;

But she grabs a young man by the back
the neck,

And gets there just the same.

Tain't no joke; just good sense:

The height of laziness is sleeping with
