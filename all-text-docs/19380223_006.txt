the actual vote is held. Some such

system becomes increasingly nec-

essary. As the student body grows

larger it will become more

difficult

even
— essentially impossible —

for any, voter to know all the can-

didates and their ° qualifications.
What simpler way of overcoming
the problem could be found than to
let members of the. graduating
class, or the student councilmen’
from that class, state each man’s

qualifications between the nomina-

tiofis and the actual elections?

Thus some such plan so as to in-
sure an intelligent voting body, and
“controlled politics” seemed the best

the

the sense in which they understood
it. Also may it be added that
nothing personal whatsoever has

been intended by these letters.
And back to the freshman

vote. The idea has been loaded in-

to the wagon. The horse is snort-

now

It only remains for the student body
to step into the seat, take up the
reins, and carry, through the amend-
