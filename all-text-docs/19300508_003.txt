Heath Whittle

One of the best athletes who ever ran
for Davidson closed his career last Sat-
urday when Capt. Heath Whittle ran his
hurdle race, the 220 yard lows in the State
meet at Greensboro. During his three
years of varsity competition he has been
one of the most consistent performers on
the squad. He capped all previous per-
formances this year when he regularly
won from fifteen to twenty points each
meet. He scored 90 points during the sea-
son, counting the West Virginia meet and
the Tech Relays.

The outstanding performance of his
college years was undoubtedly the
great race he ran against Sol Furth,
N. Y. U. champion, in the West Vir-
ginia indoor meet last March. Whittle
pushed Furth the entire distance, los-
ing out only by a hair, according to
observers. In writing to one of the
Davidson students about the race
later, the alumni secretary of West
Virginia said “Whittle is the real hero
of the meet. He was unknown to most
of us, while we have had Furth with
us before. Oh! boy, what a race!”

It will be a task to fill his place after
graduation, either on the track or off.
One of the finest men Davidson has

had on her teams!

The State Meet

The State intercollegiate track meet,
held in Greensboro last Saturday, was one
of the best conducted in reecnt years,
judged both by the number of contestants
and the records made. The weather con-
ditions were perfect; the track was in
good shape and very fast, and it was not
enough to not cause any trouble in keep-
ing the athletes warm. If anything, it was
too hot. Spectators and officials alike took
off their coats for greater comfort. And
to push the matter a little further, Joe
McCall and Kinzey, of Wake Forest, did
their broad jumping without jerseys,
wearing only trunks.

The directors of the meet had provided
all the necessary mechanical equipment
for the proper carrying-on of the com-
petition. A public address system was used
for' announcements and calling'of events;
an anemometer was set up to check the
speed of the wind in each race, so that
any records made would be counted offi-
cial. The only thing lacking was a score
board. The running score was announced
two or three times, but beyond that, no
one in the stands knew how the teams
stood from time to time, except that Caro-
lina was ahead.

Starting blocks were used for the
take-offs in all the sprints and hurdle
events. This was the first big meet in
this part of the country that these
have been used in, and there was some
divergence of opinion among the con-
testants as to their worth. Most of the
Davidson men who used them didn’t
like them so much.

pm

The 100-yard dash attracted more at-
tention than any other single event of the
afternoon’s program, due to the presence
of Charlie Farmer, Carolina ate. He easily
won both the trials and finals of the
century, his time on the latter being 9.8
seconds. His form was nearly perfect, and
he never seemed to extend himself when
he ran.

Whittle ran the high hurdles in 15.2
seconds, smashing the state record by
one-tenth of a second, but the mark
was not allowed to stand as he had
knocked over the last hurdles. George
easily won second place in the event.
Whittle also won the lows in 25 flat.
He was not closely pushed in either of
his races. ;

Only four more games remain on the
Davidson baseball card, and two of them

Davidson and Lenoir
Split Pair of Games

The Davidson nine divided a two-day en-
gagement with the Lenoir-Rhyne diamond
outfit, losing the first contest on the home
field by the close score of 5 to 4, but win-

ning the May Day contest, at Hickory,
8 to 4.
Timely hitting at opportune moments

when bingles meant runs helped the Lenoir-
Rhyne Bears to defeat the ’Cats in the first
game. Although Davidson was able to out-
hit. the Bears 11 to 9, nevertheless they
were forced to take the small end of the
score. Captain Doc Kugler pitched nice ball
for the Davidson team and collected four
singles in as many times at bat. Winecoff
for the visitors hit the best, getting three
hits out of four attempts.

The Wildcats were in form the following
day at Hickory and trounced the Lenoir-
Rhyners 8 to 4. McInnis and Kugler both
pitched fine ball and had the Bears at their
mercy, whereas the Davidson batters were

Wildcats to End Season
With Duke and Carolina

Meet University of South Carolina
Here This Afternoon

After the game today with the University
of South Carolina baseball team, the David-
nine will conclude its schedule with
three more tilts next week, two with Duke,
and a return game with Carolina. The Wild-
cats journey to Durham next Monday to
play the Blue Devils, go to Chapel Hill to
play the Tar Heels on Tuesday, and then
conclude the season with the return Duke
encounter on Richardson Field Thursday.

son

Duke’s prowess on the diamond this sea-
son is highly commendable. The Blue Devils,
than two-thirds of
games, have just returned from a
northeastern trip where they trounced many
leading college teams, namely, Villa Nova,
Princeton, and the
vania. When the Wildcats meet them in
Durham, the host will begin the game with
a record of one score victories.

their

Farley, Kistler and Werber, outstanding
Duke stars, and the last a big league pros-
pect, will give the Davidson hurlers a real
test with their slugging, if they are in reg-
ular form. The hitting of these three men
has been a feature in the past showing of
Coach Jack Coombs’ pastimers. Jenkins and
Hawkins, southpaw aces of the Duke pitch-
ing staff, may prove to be stubborn oppo-
sition for the Wildcat swatters.

On Tuesday after the game at Durham,
the Davidson baseball team will attempt to
avenge the defeat received at the hands of
Carolina earlier in the year by playing the
Tar Heels on their home diamond. The Car-
olina 9-3 victory over the Wildcats at Win-
ston-Salem will furnish
Davidson to fight hard enough to even the
balance. Although the Tar Heels are not
as strong as the Duke nine, they will sup-
ply plenty of opposition if their leading hurl-
er, Cecil Longest, is started.

Coach Younger'’s team is in good condi-
tion, most of the injured players having re-
cuperated. Nab Armfield, sterling backstop,
has returned, but will not be able to re ceive
in any more games this season, because his
infected foot is still weak.

hitting four Bear pitchers all over the field.
Red Parrish added to his string of three
base hits by adding two triples.
