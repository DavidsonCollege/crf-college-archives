Well fans, here it is, what
you've all been waiting for; the
bi-annual mid-season pre-season
Boyd poll. With thirty basket-
ball squads of all sizes, shapes,
and talents, it was even tough-

er than usual forecasting the
outcome of the three league
races.

The SAE‘s look to be a slight
favorite in League A. Most of
last Year's squad returns, Nick
Livengood, Bruce Baird, Dave
Weaver, Dave Faison, Steve
Battle, and good sophs Eldon
Basham, John Webel and Steve
Keller give the E’s great depth
shooting, although
lack of a good big man could
hurt. Still, this is a strong squad
with a good shot at winning
is probably the toughest
league.

backcoult.

Pikas after two unbeaten sea-
sons.

Cannon II is led by Dan Hen-
derson, who does it all but fre-
quently has too little help. Pat
Bennett, Chuck Gladue and
Donnie Bain are other top play-
ers. No threat for the playoffs,
but looks like the best of the
bottom four in the league.

Sentelle i! lacks scoring
punch, and needs better or-
ganization, but has an adequate
supply of talent. 65” Bill Smith
looms large in the middle, with
Tom Soos, Rick Mullen, Ward
Pritchett, and Billy Lynn. all
capable performers. This team
sorely lacks a big scorer, but
if it jells might play a spoiler
role.

The Nus are vastly improved
over a year ago but they had
a long way to go. Tom Case and
Dave Duggins have pumped new
life into the attack, and Bill
Sims, Steve Spicer and Skip
Greathouse can all play. The
Nus lack depth and size to be
a real factor.

The Plumbers deserve the
name. They simply lack size,
depth, speed, talent; in short,
everything. John Carlson, Ben
Towe, and Den Parman have
paced an anemic offense, and
that speaks volumes.

The biggest team in the
IMAC, Keeter’s, figures to walk
away with League B. 6’6” Gary
Scibal, 67” Bob Peele, 6’7”
Frank Soos, and 64 Mike O’-
Malley give them awesome re-
bounding power. Steve Williams
may be the best guard in the
IMAC. Depth is a problem, but
all things considered, this is
probably the best team around.

However, the Delts, Betas, and
PAX all have strong teams,
and it won’t be a cakewalk

The Delts feature Greg Sikes
and his brother Mike, along
with Scotty Shipp, Mike Kelley,
Bill Huffman and Jimmy
Wright, all veterans. Delts are
solid, but may have spread tal-
ent too thin (with two teams)
to win it.

The Betas once again are
sparked by quick-shooting Ran-
dy Ely, but he has more help
than: last year.

PAX has two of the best sophs

Show Youth Move

By JIM HANNA
Copy Editor

In keeping with the mood of
the country, Davidson's inter-
collegiate athletics program
seems to be engaged in a ‘‘youth
movement” of its own.

Just witness the teams that
Davidson has fielded this year:
the cross-country team's top
runners were mostly freshmen,
and the Wildcats’ basketball
bench includes several sopho-
mores, four of whom see action
regularly

The trend has continued into
the minor winter sports, as both
the swimming and_ wrestling
teams are depending mostly on
athletes who are in the first
half of their college careers.

Davidson's matmen will be
going for their third victory to-

ble squad.

day when they meet UNC-Char-
lotte here at Davidson.

The wrestlers, coached by
Charles Parker, have already
beaten Catawba College and St.
Andrews by lopsided scores, and
according to team member
Miles Ward ‘‘most everybody
has won their matches.”

Ward said the team, whose
roster includes only one senior,
is *“‘a pretty good team, but we
can’t really compete with Fur-
man, William and Mary, and
other schools that give a lot of
scholarships.”

However, Ward _ mentioned
that several Wildcat wrestlers
might be contenders for con-
ference titles in their individual
weight classes.

Swimming coach Tom Stevens
has found his team in some.
what of a dilemma over the
lack of experienced personnel.

However, Stevens explained
that four members of last year’s
team are in Europe this year,
and that there are very few
upperclassmen on the team.
