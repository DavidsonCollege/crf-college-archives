The race for Hearing Committee
positions attracted more candidates
than any other race in the Dec. 16
elections, according to Ann Garrou,
elections council chairwoman.

Garrou said that nine juniors, nine
sophomores, and 11 freshmen filed for
the Hearing Committee positions.
There are 18 members of the Hearing
Committee. Each class will elect three
people to the committee, and all
elected serve until December of their
senior year.

The function of the Hearing Com-
mittee is ‘‘to hear and determine
originally all charges of violations
presented to it by the student solicitor
on referral from the Dean,” according
to the Code of Disciplinary Procedure
(1971).

The Code of Disciplinary Proce-
dure sets forth the course to be
followed when a student is charged
with violating the Code of Responsi-
bility.

If the Dean of Students files formal
charges against a student, the Dean
holds an administrative hearing with
the student. At this hearing, the
student is given two options. The

Craig,

student may either admit the viola-
tion and submit to administratively-
imposed sanctions, or the student
may decline to admit the violation
and be tried by the Hearing Commit-
tee.

Running for the Hearing Commit-
tee from the Class of 1977 are: Gene
Broadhead, Ken Chadwick, Tom
Cooper, Steve Keener, Sue McAvoy,
Kevin McConnell, Tim Sellers, Bob
Whitaker and David Yearwood.

Running from the Class of 1978 are:
Stewart Boswell, Joe Craig, Meg
Campbell, Debbie Dillon, Ann Gray
Harvey, Hunter Jennings, John
Jones, Jeff Metzel and Sam Weir.

Running for the Committee from
the Class of 1979 are: Paul Bradley,
Bill Barnett, Alex Bass, Russell
Folger, Doug Horn, Bob McQuade,
Maria Patterson, Steve Porter, Steve

Sellers, Warren Soule, and Jamie
Watt.

Students running for Hearing Com-
mittee positions submitted to The

Davidsonian some written responses
to questions. The following are ex-
