LITTLE ANNIE JACKSON
LITERARY SOCIETIES DIES IN CHARLOTTE
SCHEDULE.

Debate, Saturday night, February 23:
“Resolved, That the city manager plan
of government should be adopted by
cities having a population of over 10,-
ooo.”

The whole faculty and student body
were filled with grief to hear last Tues-
day morning of the untimely death of
Annie, daughter of Mr. F. L. Jackson.
The death occurred in Charlotte, where
the little girl had been taken for treat-
ment. For some time she had been suf-
fering with tonsilitis, This disease ran
on into rheumatism, and then into rheu-
matism of the heart. Despite the efforts
of physicians the disease proved fatal.

All who know them join in sympathy
for Mr. Jackson and his family in their

Eumenean Society—Debate—Affirma-
tive: Mitchell, Burgess, Craig. Nega-
tive: McCaskill, Boulware, Matthews.
Orations: McElroy, Frierson.

Philanthropic Society—Initiation of
new members and installation of officers.

The men in the Eumenean Society
seem to be taking more interest in society
work, as was shown last Saturday night.
Every man on the program was present
with something to say on the subject:
“Resolved, That the Federal Govern-
ment should control the distribution and
consumption of all food and foodstuffs
in the United States, for the period of] .
the war.” The affirmative, upheld by C.
B. Robson, Smith and Thomas, contend-
ed (1) that it is necessary for the suc-
cessful waging of the war, in that we are
called upon to feed a great part of the
world; (2) that the Federal Govern-
ment can control this better than by any
other means; (3) it is just. ‘The nega-
tive, upheld by G. M. Robson, Orgain
and Turner, contended (1) that it
would be impracticable; (2) it would be
contrary to the democratic form of gov-
ernment; (3) another plan would be
better. J. B. Woods gave an oration on
“The part that the American College
has taken in the War.” E. A. Woods
spoke on the negative side of the ques-
tion, “Should Japan adopt a policy simi-
lar to the Monroe Doctrine.”

At the meeting of the Philanthropic
Society Saturday night an unusually in-
teresting program was rendered. ‘Ihe
question debated was government control
of foodstuffs during the war. ‘The af-
firmative was upheld by Siske, Caldwell
and Freeman, who contended that gov-
ernment control prevented extravagance
and waste and assured plenty of food for,
the Allies. The negative was defended
by Morton, Peters and T. C. Stone,
whose chief argument was that govern-
ment control was undemocratic and
tended toward socialism. The decision
was given to the affirmative. W. M
Currie gave an oration on “Germany's
School System and its effect upon the
German People,” while the subject of
Mountcastle’s oration was “Military
Highways.” The subject for extempo-
rary debate was, “Resolved, That the
college should require six hours of drill
each week.” W. F. Hall contended that
the drill should be increased because of
physical benefits and military experience
gained. Chalmers successfully defended
the negative, arguing that better exer-
cise can be taken and that present stu-
dents should prepare themselves for aft-
er the war. The president announced
that the service flag for the society had
been ordered.

McARN LEADS AT
CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR

The Christian Endeavor Society held
its regular meeting Sunday night, Feb-
ruary 17, in Shearer Hall. The meeting
was led by A. D. McArn, who gave a
short talk on the subject, “What Our
Church is Doing.” He cited the fact
that the church’s work is divided into
four parts: the local fteld, the home mis-
sion, the foreign mission and the war
work. In the general discussion more
interest than usual was manifested quite
a few of the members giving thoughts
and suggestions on the topic.

It was announced that next Sunday
there would be a joint meeting of the
Christian Endeavor Society, the Minis-
terial and Volunteer Bands.

great bereavement, in the loss of their
youngest child, a child that had already
endeared herself to all who knew her.
She was an affectionate and lovable girl,
one who brought joy wherever she went.
‘Those who knew her remember the
many incidents that showed her beautiful
and affectionate nature.

Sincere and heartfelt is the expression
of grief from the wide circle of friends,
for their sorrow is ours.
