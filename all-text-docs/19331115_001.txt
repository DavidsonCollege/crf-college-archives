ical Seminary of Richmond, Va.

with a special song service, which is

dents of Davidson College. Seniors
will remember that he conducted a
similar series of services when they
were freshmen. He was himself an
outstanding undergraduate as an ath-
lete and campus leader, playing on the
varsity football team and holding many
student body offices. He has been
honored with membership in Omicron
Delta Kappa, honorary leadership fra-
ternity, and in Phi Beta Kappa. At
present, Dr. Lacy is the president of
the Alumni Association.,

Dr. Lacy studied. at Oxford as a
Rhodes Scholar, after his graduation
from Davidson, During the war, he
was a chaplain overseas, and is one of
the most beloved men in that service.

While he is at Davidson, Dr. Lacy
will stay with Dr. R. S. Burwell on”
Concord Street.

One of the special features of the
Fall Services this year is the series of
personal conferences and group dis-
cussions which Dr. Lacy hopes to hold.
All men who would like to discuss
further any of the topics on which
Dr. Lacy speaks, or any other sub-
jects, will be welcome to these open
forums. More specific announcements
will be made concerning them after
Dr. Lacy’s arrival, but all men are
urged to bear them in mind and be
preparing to take part in them.

The general theme of Dr. Lacy’s
talks has not been announced, but it
will be made public before the end of
the week. :

In giving the information concerning
the Fall Services, Sam Wiley, Y. M.
C. A, secretary, said: “ The evangelistic
services in the fall and spring are the

high peaks of the ‘Y’ program for the

year, and this series of services will

mean a lot to the spiritual life of the

Group to Conduct Night School
in Mill District

THY Mi Gray last

meeting for all freshmen who were

interested in “Y” work. There were

about forty men present, and the group

was very enthusiastic in its response

week held a

to the suggestions which were made by
Sam Wiley and E. L. Powell.

One of the first plans made was té
conduct a study class, probably based
on the book, “Ten Studies on the Ser-
mon on the Mount.” Some member
of the faculty will be asked to discuss
a part of the book each night until
the members of the group can them-
selves take over the leadership of these
meetings. Friday night at 7 o'clock
was selected as the meeting time, and
the place will be the Social Center.
If this time does not conflict with
other meetings, it will probably be se-
lected as the regular time.

The suggestion which met with great
response was the plan to conduct a
night school for illiterates in the mill
district. Sam Wiley has been plan-
ning this for some time, and he hopes
to be able to carry it out with this
group under the leadership-of-upper-
classmen.

Various ways of rendering service to
the college were suggested and dis-
cussed by the group. It was agreed
that they should take over the job of
ushering at the “Y” vesper meetings.
A definite schedule for this work will
probably be announced later.

The suggestion was made that up-
perclassmen be asked to discuss the
different phases of “Y” work for the
benefit of the freshmen in this group.
The idea of this is to get the new
men in line for definite service in some
special branch of the “Y” work.

Wiley and Powell both emphasized
the fact that this group was not a
formal organization with any set pur-
pose, but it was a band, loosely organ-
ized, to work together in Christian fel-
lowship to help others. “:

Debate Try-Outs

To Be Brought To
Close This Evening

Six Debaters and Three Alter-
? nates to be Chosen by
Judges

TEN MEN ARE ELIGIBLE

Eliminations Held Last Thurs-
day, Friday, and Tuesday

On Thursday, Friday, and Tuesday
nights, the Forensic Council, headed
by E. J. Humphrey, has held debating
tryouts in Chambers Building. Ten
men have been selected as eligible for
the debating teams.
~ About ten men competed at cach
tryout, each candidate speaking five
minutes on a chosen point of the query
to be used by Eta Sigma Pi this year,
“Resolved, That the Powers of the
President Should be Substantially In-
creased as a_ Settled Policy.” On
Thursday night, G. H. Brown, R. M.
Cann and W. F, Goodykoontz were
selected as eligible for the teams; Fri-
day, R. Pratt-Thomas, R. H. Smith,
J. H. Fitzgerald, and A. C. Stutts were
chosen from nine candidates, and W.
L. Fugate, J. R. Harper, and E. I.
Humphrey were the successful men on
Tuesday night.

The final elimination will be held
tonight at 7 o'clock to determine the
six men who will compose the teams
and the three who will be the alter-
nates. The student body is especially
urged to attend the tryout tonight. The
audience is assured of entertainment by
the extraordinarily good speeches and
keen competition that will be displayed.
Furthermore, a good audience is nec-
essary if the judges are to fairly judge
the speakers, especially in» respect to
the speakers’ poise on the platform.

The Forensic Council, of which Ed
Humphrey is president, has Dr. C. K.
Brown, Dr. W.‘P. Cumming, Dr. P. H.
Gwynn, and Prof. A. Currie as judges
of the speeches.

The teams will make three nine-day
trips to various colleges, competing in
four debates each trip.

placed particular emphasis on the fi-

pointed out the great decline in rail

showed that the financial condition of
the southern railroads was worse than
that of any other section because traf-
fic began to decline here in 1926 rather
than in 1929. In 1933, the traffic began
to pick up more in the South than in

session on Friday.

The two lectures were much dis-

importance were held on Friday and

“T think that the people of North
Carolina are against liquor, and when-
ever they are given the opportunity

said Archibald Currie, professor of

interview on the repeal of the 18th
amendment,

Several other interesting facts were
also revealed as the result of the inter-
view, part of which follows:

Question. Did prohibition really pro-
hibit the drinking of liquor?

Answer. Yes.

Q. Will repeal lead to more drink-

A. Yes, I think so.

Q. Will repeal rid the country of

A. Not entirely. We will always
have bootleggers. We had them be-

Q. Will government regulation of

A. It never has been.
Q. What power, if any, does the

duce uniformity?

A. It has none. It can produce
uniformity only through its power to
control interstate commerce. It can

Scouts Miss Game

Members of the B-squad were
sorely disappointed when they
reported for practice Monday
afternoon, because there were no
new plays for them to learn and
run against the varsity this week.

It happened that Coaches
“Doc” Unger and Flake Laird
had gone to Willaimsburg, Va.,
to scout William and Mary,
whom Davidson meets this Sat-
urday. When they got there, the
coaches learned that the Indians
had gone to Emory and Henry
‘to play the Wasps there in a
night game. The two immediate-
ly changed their course towards
the scene of the game. It was
8:30 p. m. when they got to
Wytheville. The game had start-
ed half an hour before and there
was yet 60 miles to go. Dis-
gusted, they decided to call it a
day and came back to Davidson
after a fruitless journey.

MACKORELL RUNS WILD

Hutchins and Wingfield Score
Other Wildcat Touchdowns

Led by the brilliant playing of
Johnny Mackorell, the Davidson Wild-
cats came from behind in the opening
period of the game to rout the Citadel
Bulldogs 24 to 6 in a spectacular Arm-
istice Day battle.

The game, sponsored by the Char-
lotte Junior League, attracted approxi-
mateyl 4,500 customers, who were
given a treat in broken field running,
down-field blocking, first downs, and
touchdowns,

With the score knotted at 6-6 in the»
second period, Davidson had the ball”
on its own 25-yard line. Wingfield
flipped a lateral to Mackorell, who, in-
stead of running around his right end,
cut back to his left toward the entire
Citadel team and, aided by machine-
like interference, threaded his way to
the goal line. Wingfield and McElrath
cut down Ferguson and Quarterman,
Citadel backs, near the goal line in a
successful effort to aid their teammate.

A 05-yard kick by Quarterman, Cit-
adel’s famous punter, put Davidson in
the hole in the opening period, when
the ball rolled out on the 10-yard line.

The Cadets, aided by 15 and 8-yard
dashes by Ferguson, drove: from their
41 to the goal line, where Quarterman
on the second down crashed off-tackle
for a touchdown. Ferguson tried the
line for extra -point, but was stopped.

A 20-yard run by Wingfield led the
Wildcats to Citadel's goal line, where
another ruby Wingfield took the ball
around for a

end touchdown, tying

the score.

In the next kickoff Citadel began a
drive which cagried them to Davidson's
30, where Workman of Citadel fum-
bled, It after an exchange of
