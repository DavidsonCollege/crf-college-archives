Studs prepare run for our money

By MARK POSTOVE
Staff Writer

“We have set a really agg-
ressive goal for this year,’’
senior Bill Cole remarked,
“‘and we have the studs to
make it.’’ The goal is 260
miles; the event is a 24-hour
relay to raise money for the
Bushiangala Secondary
School in Kenya, East Africa.
The runners plan to secure
pledges by students and busi-
nesses for the mileage com-
pleted.

At 2 pm on Friday, May 7,
Davidson’s third 24-hour relay
will begin. This is a contin-
uous relay in which ten men
alternate running one mile
intervals for 24 hours.

The 260-mile distance would

break the North Carolina
State record of 254 miles set
here last May by a’group of
Davidson students. In addi-
tion, it would place this year’s
group into the all-time top 100
relay teams, according to sta-
tistics published by the April,
1976, issue of Runner’s World
magazine.

All proceeds from the relay
will go to the Bushiangala
School. This school was star-
ted by the local Africans after
Great Britain granted Kenya
their independence in 1963,
using only resources from the
local community, without any
outside assistance. The pres-
ent enrollment is approxima-
tely 300 students. Four Dav-

_idson students have taught

there (Bob Clayton, Mike

Ramsey, Crawford Crenshaw,
and Jeff Castelli), and three
more plan to be there next
year (George Reedy, Lynn
Satherlie, and Coty Pinckney
—he is on the relay team!).
At this time the school has
three major needs: textbooks
for the teachers and students,
laboratory equipment, and a
new dormitory. Since the
school is locally controlled,
all funds can go directly to
fulfill these needs with no
government interference.
“The relay team has chosen
to raise funds for this school
for two reasons,”’ said one of
the runners. ‘‘First and fore-
most is the record of the
people of Bushiangala, which
shows their desire to develop
their community. Secondly,

Davidson College has a direct
connection with them through
the students who have worked
and who plan to work there.

Davidson’s first 24-hour re-
lay was run in the spring of
1973, with 237 miles covered.
No relay was run in 1974 due

Raitt concert rates in gut-grabbing

By CATHY LANDIS
Features Editor

Vivacious is a good adjective, but
not good enough. Gutsy is close but
foxy is better. Maybe the only
adjective to describe her is her name.
Bonnie Raitt. Raitt gave the Wins-
ton-Salem audience Saturday, April
17, a concert they won’t soon forget.
She sang the blues.

Raitt accompanies herself on the
guitar and unlike many singers has
some knowledge of the instrument.
She plays at her best on the slide
guitar when the wail of the strings
compliments the lilt in her voice. The
combination grabs the gut.

Saturday night the drummer lacked
the finesse worthy of a Raitt best. At
one point, Raitt herself took her
guitar and mockingly hit him over the

head. The guitar player seemed as
loose. The pianist, however, made up
for his partners with a sharply
sensitive accompaniment and a few
solo licks. The bass guitar player gave
an equally professional performance.

The audience loved Raitt as much
as she seemed to enjoy playing for
them. They applauded both at the
beginnings of some key selections as
well as the end. I think they were just
enthusiastic. The audience’s reaction
was refreshing; Raitt does not claim a
wide following. ’

Raitt, who has been singing profes-
sionally for eight years claims five
record albums to her name. She comes
from an entertainment family; her
father is John Raitt of Broadway
fame. A life-long friend of the blues,
Raitt dropped out of college to sing
them.

Livingston Taylor warmed up the
audience. Unfortunately known more
for his famous brother James, then
for any musical reputation of his own,
Livingston could hold his own in any
competition with his brother. The
folksy style of Taylor provided an
appropriate contrast to Raitt. Taylor
began on the guitar, switched to the
piano, and ended on the banjo; he
handled each admirably, but seemed
most at home on the guitar. He
seemed to enjoy his work; the
audience loved him.

Winston-Salem is not the usual
place to celebrate Spring Frolics at
Davidson, but Davidson did not have
Bonnie Raitt. It was good to get out
of Davidson, refreshing to hear a
performer give her all, and revitali-
zing to hear the blues. Bonnie Raitt
knocked us out.

to construction of the Heath
Whittle track. Seven of the
members of the original team
returned in 1975 to record 254
miles,. which still stands as a
state record. Runner’s World
reports that this mark was the
36th best distance out of over
250 relays that were run in
1975. The collegiate record of
285 miles, held by California
Polytechnic, and the world
record of 297 miles, held by
the Edinburgh Athletic Club
of Scotland, were both set in
1974.

Half of the members of the
1976 team are 24-hour relay
veterans. Senior Bill Cole will
attempt his fifth relay, while
staff members Mark Connors,
senior Mark Postove, and
junior Coty Pinckney each
have run twice previously.
Sophomore Zack Murrell ran
last year for the first time.
New members include cross
country and track standouts
Fred Borch, Doug Horn, Ed
Anderson, and John Barks-
dale.

All members of the team
have expressed their desire for
support from the students.
“‘Last year, support was
good,” remarked Cole. ‘‘Peo-
ple were out at 2 am pacing us,
which was a big help. This
year we hope the support will
be even better, and we encour-
age everyone to come out and
run a few laps with us.”

Students can make their
pledges at designated tables
on campus next week, or by
contacting Crawford Cren-
shaw (Sentelle 108) at 892-
7788. A pledge table will be
manned during the relay for
additional contributions.
