THIS WEEK'S INTERVIEW with Dr. Tom Scott|long for his basketball team.

(page 1) points up one of Davidson’s chief problems:
The need for a realistic athletic program. We have
reached a point at which we can no longer expect to
have winning teams in football and basketball as long
as we play under the present policies of subsidization
and admissions. Davidson gives out fewer scholarships
than any other Southern Conference school while at
the same time setting much stiffer entrance require-
ments of athletes.

Maybe, and the Wildcats
have lost 13 of 17.

But Scott was optimistic. Not
that he had any reason to be,
since Virginia Tech sits atop
the conference and Davidson
occupies the cellar.

The two teams were slated to
clash here tonight. The Gobblers
sport “the best center in the

conference—Chris Smith,” said
Scott. Their top scorer is a
sophomore forward Bucky Kel-
ler.

The Southern Conference, in the last three years,
has “gone bigtime.” institutions like Furman and The
Citadel, once on as subsidization program similar to
ours, suddenly doubled football grants and increased
emphasis on other sports. As a result, the conference,
one of the largest in the nation, has also become one
of the strongest. While the conference has made great
strides athletically, Davidson has stood stock still.

Davidson has been in this predicament once before,
in 1953, when we didn’t win a single football game.
But that year, the Big Four (Wake Forest, U.N.C., N. C.
State, Duke) pulled out of the conference, formed the
ACG, and left Davidson to play teams of comparable
strength. Now, seven years later, the cycle has worked
its way around again—except now there appears to be
no Big Four to drop out and relax the competition.

Davidson is competing successfully with confer-
ence teams on the minor sports level but is it only a
question of time until we're outclassed in these also?
Recent disappointing seasons in baseball and wrestling
would seem to indicate as much.

WHAT'S THE SOLUTION? We. haven't got an an-

and handball be gan this

for this coming week.

In Wednesday's basketball ac-
tion, the KA’s trounced the
ATO’s 170-41. Hight Redmond
and Bill Gayle led the KA

Owens had 14 for the ATO’s.

THE QUESTION of whether or not inactive fratern-
ity members are eligible to compete in the intramural
league for the Independent team has come before the
IMAC and the issue remains deadlocked. There is no
provision covering the problem in IMAC regulations
and it. takes a two-thirds majority to put one on the
books. The vote was tied last Wednesday night at six-
six, with one representative absent.

The only thing certain is that inactives will be
able to play for the Independents throughout the en-
tire basketball and handball seasons. Another vote
will be taken to determine eligibility for track and
the spring sports.

WE FEEL that it would be in keeping with the
Council’s objective to provide an opportunity for all to
participate in sports at Davidson to allow the inactives
to play for the Independents.

The IMAC has also come under some criticism for
not allowing freshmen who received a freshman
numeral last year in basketball to play for thier
fraternity this year. On this question, we agree with
IMAC president Ty Finch, who maintains that the rule
is a good one. Its purpose is defeated by the athletic
department, which gave a numeral to every player
on the team, regardless of how much he played. The
rule was designed to keep sophomores from dropping
off varsity athletic teams to play for their fraternity.
This was a frequent occurrence in wrestling, where an
athlete would resign just in time to compete in the I-F
meet, then come back out for the varsity team.

COACH SCOTT has a new prospect for his basket-
ball squad in transfer Lee Coward. A 5-10 guard, Coward
transferred from N. C. State College, where he was on
part scholarship. He is from Goldsboro and played prep

asketball at McCauley. Coward won’t help us this year,
however, as he doesn’t become eligible until next fall.

Hot Catfish, 5-1,

Davidson's swimming team will put its fine record
on the line again next Thursday and Friday against
Georgia and Georgia Tech respectively.

The Catfish are the bright spot on Davidson’s winter
sport’s scene. Their 5-1 record is marred only by a
controversial early season loss to V.M.I.

Coach Shoe said that he still
expects a number of school

Davidson's last victory came
at the expense of Virginia
Tech before the exam period
began. The Catfish came from
behind to take the meet 49-
46 by winning the final relay.
The upset win was one of the
most exciting athletic events
‘at Davidson in a long time.
Swimming Coach Dwight
Shoe attributed the victory to
desire and “a lot of team spirit.”
“Bill Hellier came out of

that day,” Shoe noted. “His

“We had a real bad game

But the Wildcats broke a 12-

and Allan Millar, 11.

LAST CHANCE

Last chance for Scott’s play-
ers to break out of the cellar
for a Southern Conference
tourney berth will be Tuesday
night at V.M.I.

The Keydets are already as-
sured an appearance in the
post-season tournament. But
Richmond, with only one con-
ference victory, may not make
it. The Spiders have another
game left with V.M.I. Should
they lose, the Wildcats will be
ahead of them in the standings.

Guard Jerry Bussell has re-
covercd from his nose injury.

Bill Shinn, crack forward, is
looking real good, according to
Scott. “He's driving better now.”

“Maybe,” Scott said again,
“we can give those guys a good
game.”

FRESHMEN

While the varsity basketball
team took on a pair of challen-
gers this week, Coach Hunt's
freshmen stayed home and
practiced for their last two
games of the season.
