Davidson-in-Mwandi program focuses on health care in
Africa: An interview with Dr. Salvador Garcia de la Torre

On Thursday November 14, 1996, Dr. Salvador Garcia de la Torre and his wife Mrs.
Irma Garcia de la Torre visited Davidson College. At an evening address in the Morrison
Room of the College Union, Dr. Garcia spoke to students and faculty about his experiences
in Mwandi, Zambia, where he served as missionary and medical practitioner ‘for ten years.
The presentation functioned also as an impromptu informational session for the College’s
ongoing “Davidson in Mwandi” program, a six -week summer research experience under
the direction of sociology professor Janet Shannon. The following is an excerpt from an’
interview conducted with Dr. Garcia prior to his presentation:

What were your objectives upon
arriving in Mwandi and to what
extent were they realized?

We tried to encourage more com-
munity participation. We didn’t
want to be seen as paternalistic but
rather as the facilitators, those
who encouraged the people to up-
lift themselves. The mission was
established in 1886, but unfortu-
nately, the French missionaries left

-in the late 1960s because of the

political situation in neighboring
countries. When we arrived, there
were no lights. We literally had to
depend upon candlelight for medi-
cal work.

We set up a 10-year development
program. We were able to realize
the establishment of many struc-
tures: a hospital, a church, a learn-
ing Center. We had a holistic ap-
proach in our mission work. We
wanted to provide not only, medi-

What was your motivation for

serving in such a economically
disadvantaged region as Mwandi?

Ialways wanted to practice in rural
areas, to serve underprivileged
people. I set out to be a vehicle for
those in .rural areas of Mexico,
Haiti, and Zambia, who do not
have access to decent medical care.

I believe it’s possible to provide
and enjoy providing medical care
in a very isolated place...

The Lozi (natives of Mwandi) are
very poor. Their income is
about $150 per year per capita
..very poor. In the Third World
when a doctor is involved, as in my
case, you have to be more of an
administrator than a clinician.

How would you describe the cur-
rent political climate in Mwandi?

Well, now, it is quite stable. The
wars in Angola and Zimbabwe
have ended, and the situation in
Namibia (another nation border-
ing Zambia) has settled down.

The whole of Zambia has been
relatively stable since indepen-
dence in 1964, The country has
gone from Marxist to a free market
economy under President Chilua.

‘Bit the’ people are still véry poor,

still adjusting to the transition.

The standard of living has im-
proved, though. The people are
very receptive and appreciative.
Our mission (funded in large part
by the Presbyterian Church USA)
has given the people more confi-
dence in themselves. They are
more optimistic about the future
and see opportunities to grow us-
ing mission resources...I believe

that will continue!

Whatcana Davidson student hope
to gain from the Davidson in
Mwandi program experience ?

It is a tremendous opportunity to
get in touch with what we always
call “the real world,”...to work ina
very remote place, ina village set-
ting away from the city, away from
any source of distraction...to get to
know the people in their own envi-
ronment and face the cultural dif-
ferences, and find out that despite
those differences, it is possible’ to
actively work together, a
It’s been challenging, frustrating
at times, to know a diagnosis and
have no means with which to treat
it ... ?ve seen Davidson students
respond to these challenges. They
understand the situation, learn to
be more sensitive to the needs of
the develo ing, world—I believe
that’s'the key. “Coming back, they
will appreciate and put more \ |
in what they have, what they see.

There’s no quick fix ... our work
will take a while. But the most
important part is to understand the
needs of communities outside the
U.S., especially in third world
countries. Then, we becotne part
of the solution .... we find that we
do have something to giye the
people of Zambia: ourselves.
