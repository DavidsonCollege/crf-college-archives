During the past year, in the course of our ramblings
around the campus we have been trying unsuccessfully

to get some concrete dope on the construction of the new
gym. From what we have been able to discover there is
little prospcet that this work will begin in the near future.
This means that for the next year at least the majority of
our home basketball games will have to be played on the
Charlotte Armory floor. This cuts down on the size of
the cheering section and handicaps the ball-club itself —
it is almost the same as playing on a neutral floor. These
are definite handicaps, but in spite of this the course that
the administration is following is sound. When funds
were collected for our new athletic plant, prices were at
a pre-war level. Now the costs of materials have sky-
rocketed and the sum collected will not be sufficient to
build a gym to compare with the one orignially planned.
As a result the powers that be have decided to postpone
the ground breaking until prices drop or until more
financial aid is forthcoming. This is hard on those
of us who would like to have the use of the new plant
during ourccollege career, but from an unselfish point of
view it’s better this way. Most of us will never benefit
directly from it (except as spectators in later years ), but
the Davidson students of the future will profit from this
farsightedness on the part of the athletic department.
Reports from reliable sources have it that the

baseball park is soon to be transferred from its

present site to Freshmen Field. From this corner

that looks like a wise move. It will, admittedly

take lots of work to get the new plot in shape,

but once it’s done it will be a great improvement.

For one thing it will enable the outfielders to

snag a few of those long flies that drop into the

concrete stands on Richardson Field for ground

rule doubles. It also will”make it possible for

the track squad to use the cinder path without

interference from the baseballers.

The crowds (?) at recent track meets, baseball games,
and tennis matches haven’t been anything to brag about.
It’s hard to believe that in a group of 900 plus men there
are so few who are interested enough to attend the
athletic events on the campus, regardless of whether or
not the various teams are on the winning side of the
ledger. From now on let’s drag ourselves out of our
respective sacks and take in the ball games. The
players need and deserve more support,

While booting the softball around with the worst of
them for a week on the interfrat front, we have heard
lots of complaints about theumpiring. Aside from the fact
that most of them are alleged to be totally blind and un-
able to distinguish between a ball and a strike, the. chief
gripe has been that these volunteer (or drafted) arbitra-
tors aren’t much‘help when disputes arise which involve
technical rules. To prevent bad feeling and ,,needless
delay on the playing field the umpires should be selected,
instructed, and assigned by the intermural sports de-
partment, as was done during the football season. While
we are at it, the same thing goes for volleyball. Only
impartial officials should be allowed to call those, net
touching infractions.

LOOPING THE LOOP

Duke’s 5-4 victory over Carolina’s baseball
club came as a distinct surprise to most of ‘us.
Just goes to prove that you can’t sell the cany
Blue Devil coach, Jack Coombs, short. After an
erratic beginning, his charges have apparently hit
their stride. — The Wildcat’s tennis match with
Georgia Tech was much closer than the 3-6 score
might-indicate. The locals. really threw a scare
into the Southeastern Conference champs before
going down to defeat. — Chan Highsmith, ace
North Carolina ‘center, who suffered a serious
back injury in last season’s game with Virginia’s
Cavaliers has decided to hang up his moleskins
for good.

‘Cat Trackers

Clemson’s cindermen downed the
‘Cat tracksters Saturday in a meet,
on the Cadets’ track. It was the
second loss of the season for Pete
Whittle’s charges who still showed
a lack of strength in the dash
events.

The Red and Black took half of
the first in the 14 event
card, but lacked sufficient reserve
strength to pile up the points. In
the 100 yard dash they failed to
gain a point and only garnered a
single marker in the 220 on Jimmy
Siffords third slot.

Jack “Gunder? Gray continued
his winning ways by romping to
the tape first in both the mile and
two mile runs. For his efforts he
tied with Ed Hopper as. the high
point maker for the ’Cats. Both

tories in both the high and low
hurdles.°' Since both of these boys
are spohomores, Coach Pete Whit-
tle is looking to big things from

K. A.s - Betas In
‘Sloftball Lead

After the first week of play on
the softball front two teams are
clinging to the lead, with a trio
of other contenders hot on their
heels. The pace setters, the KA’s
and the Beta’s battled their way to
the top by winning 2 victories in as
many starts.

The KA’s took their pair from
the Phi the Pikas by
scores of 8-5 and 14-13 respectively.
The Beta’s topped the Independents
8-2 and then took a high scoring
fracas from the Sigmas 16-15,

Close behind the leaders were the
SPE’s who the Pikas
8-4; the Pi.Kaps with a lone win
over the luckless Sigmas; and the
SAE’s who blasted the Phi Delts
12-7.

Next in line were. the Phi Gams
who broke even in two outings,
their triumph coming at the ex-
pense of the Independents. The Phi
Delts hold undisputed possession of
the seventh slot followed by the Pi
Kaps, Independents} and Kappa
Sigs.

French Star

In his second exhibition match of
Bill Lufler recently de-
feated Henri Crosson, 6 foot 8 inch
French pro in a tight battle. Los-
ing his first set by the discourag-
ing score of 0-6, he came back to
win the next two sets 7-5, and 6-4,

the season,

and with them, the match. His
first appearance was on the David-
son campus where he met Fred

Perry.

Karly this spring, Coath Lufler
resgined his post at the Charlotte
Country Club which he had held
since 1940. More recently, he has
signed for one year at the Belle
Meade Country Club in Nashville.
These new duties will not interfere
with his duties at the St. Peters-
burg club, and we hope it won't
take him away from Davidson.

Since he has been at Davidson,
Bill Lufler has concentrated on
building up the Wildcat squad, and
in doing so, he has brought a sweet
taste of victory to the Red and
Black. Going through last season
undefeated, this spring his success
will in no way be‘dimmed by losses.

Cagey as usual, Coach Story
makes no predictions as to the pros-
pects for 47. He admits that it will
be a tough schedule and that the
team will have to play good ball
to make any kind of a showing.
Probably the most outstanding man
during spring practice has been
Cliff Turner who may possibly
break into the regular line-up’ at
tailback next fall. Cliff shows lots
of improvement all the way round
over last fall. By working on fun-
damentals, Coach Story is trying
to perfect the Wildcat gridiron ma-

chine. Some of the linemen who
deserve honorable mention are:
Eborn, Strait, Bailey, Richards,

Johnson, Sharpe, Stricklin, Boyd,
Preyer, Alexander, and Brown.
Fowle, Walker, “Richert, “White-
hurst, Rimer, Adams, and Austin
likewise look pretty good. Mac
Erwin, head man in the fullback
department, has: been out of prac-
tice with an injured knee, and it is
doubtful whether he will get in
the games or not.

Cincinnati Downed
By’ Wildcats, 9 - 8

Making its first home appearance
in new uniforms last Wednesday,
the Davidson baseball team won its
first game of the season,

belting
the” University

of Cincinnati, 9-7.
The victory broke a nine game los-
ing streak for the locals.

Earp Winning Pitcher

The ‘Cat runs came in two big in-
nings. Six hits coupled with sev-
eral errors and a number of walks
enabled Davidson to tally four runs
in the fourth and five in the fifth
frame. . Mapes was the big gun
in the Wildcat attack getting two
hits in three trips to the plate—
one of which was a double into the
centerfield stands. f

Earp started on the mound and
pitched beautiful ball until he was
relieved by Torrence in the fifth.
The latter’s wildness kept the team
in hot water throughout the re-
mainder of the game with the vis-
itors scoring once in the sixth and
seventh innings, andtwo in both
the eighth and ninth.

Furman Is Victorious

Before large Spring Frolic
crowd, it was a different story with
the Davidsonians losing to a visit-
ing Furman. nine, 8-6, Davidson
started the scoring by pushing
across two. runs in the second frame,
but the South “Carolinians scored
three in the third,and four in the
fourth to take a commanding lead.
The ’Cats kept pecking away, scor-
ing three in the seventh and one
in the ninth, but were unable to
forge ahead. The victors’ last run
came on Centerfielder Schuyler’s
homer into the left field hedge.
Davidson outhit their rivals 12
to 6, but erratic play afield and
Whiteheart’s wildness made the dif-
ference between victory and defeat.
The invaders. bunched their hits to
advantage while Davidson’s were
well scattered.
