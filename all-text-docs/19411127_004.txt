CAT CHAT

By LACY MacLEAN

The gridiromseasorm is closed for Davidson as well as for
almost all the rest the football world. A few scattered
scheduled fravs remain, including Wake Forest’s with Texas
Tech in Charlotte Saturday along with the flock of bowl and
post season affairs, but in substance the football season, fall,
has gone> It was for the Wildcats a particularly disappointing
year, even more so now than when the year opened, for in-
stance, our top team playing good ball might easily have licked
Carolina, even though we didn’t expect it in September.

Optimists had predicted that we might win seven of our
games. Looking back, we can see that Furman and Caro-
lina and State were all overrated and that with our best
ball showing, we could have won these three even if the
pre-season dopesters had us down to lose. The tough
year can be put, as everyone on the campus knows, on the
shoulder’s of Davidson’s worst injury streak in years, to
quote Coach Spearman, the worst in the last five years
combined. Its just too bad, but the Citadel game goes

a long way toward leaving a—good. taste in _everyone’s

mouth. The only bad thought connected with it is the 15

seniors, 8 of them: first-string-performers who’ll be watch-

ing Davidson play from now on.

Dave Spencer, Claude Hackney, Johnny Miller, Gene Shan-
non, Bob Smith, Bill Fai Bill Shaw, Ed Hipp, Don Bell,
Dave Henderson, Ub. FF. Mi iT Frank Caldwell,
Ed Hay, Sam Woodward—thev'll al I be missing and they’ll be
missed. Most of these were part of one of the most athletically
inclined classes which ha nin the last several
years, they’re a talented bunch, ane deserve recognition
for their four years of service.

Another Bouquet -

While we’re passing out bouquets the freshmen should
come in for a nice one. The football boys in particular.
They went undefeated, and that’s all you could ask of a
football team. They allowed only 12 points to be scored
against them, and that’s something else. But whteher
the squad is much better than the frosh outfits of past
years, or how they would come out in Big Five competition
is only a matter of conjecture. It appears that they are
just about on an even calibre with the other yearling
elevens which Davidson has produced except for the fact
that they were two or three instead of one deep. How
much this would have helped them against hard opposition
is impossible to estimate. :

However inaccurate compartive and are,
they can at least be quoted as interésting. Against Mars Hill,
whom our frosh beat 19-0, Carolfna frosh, previously beaten
by both Wake Forest and State, scored 52 points. The Tar
Babies rolled up 512 yards fronr rushing alone not to mention
140 odd from passing. But then they turnéd aroundsand beat
Duke. You can never tell what’s going to happen; next year
about this time, we'll really be able to see “just what kind
of a freshman ball club we had. this year.

Cats. Vs. Wake Forest

In reply to an article recently published in The Student
Wake Forest magazine entitled Davidson vs. Wake Forest,
the Wildcat athletic official had. this comment to make.
The reasons which Davidson had for severing football re-
lationships with the Deacons still stand. The move was
a part of Davidson’s de-emphasis program, just as the
break with Furman of gridiron activities for next season
was. No hard feeling was intended. :
The Davidson athletic officials were. content to continue

relations with the Deacons in basket-ball and baseball and all
the other sports in which the tendencies of the opponents
toward emphasis would not be degradatory to both the David-
son athlete’s spirit and physical condition, In football, this
condition is more pronounced, and therefore Davidson wished
to substitute someone more in her ownclass as fareas football
was concerned; the rest of the break (that in the schedules
of basketball and baseball) came from the Wake Forest-ath-
letic department. All that can be said farther on the matter
is that the Davidson schedules have been completed up until
a year from this time.

Spencer And Hackney End College Career In Football
With Great Passing Combination To Outclass
Bulldogs in Season’s Last Game.

By BUTCH PHARR
Davidson’s fightin’ Wildcats closed, the season and cele-
brated Turkey Day by downing the favored Citadel eleven
24-14 for their first win of the year.

Spencer Stars

Little Davey Spencer ended his college career in a final blaze
of glory, pitching all three of the touchdown passes and com-
pleting more than one-half of the number thrown. His run-
ning and kicking were also outstanding as he easily outshone
the two highly vaunted stars of the Citadel, Victor and
Salvato.
