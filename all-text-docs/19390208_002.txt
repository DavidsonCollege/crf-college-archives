Fraternities

During this period of the year when many
men are being initiated into fraternities there
are some who always wonder, and not en-
tirely without cause perhaps, if these or-
ganizations are worth what they cost or if
the money put into them is not at least
partially wasted.

We realize fully that any discussion we*
might undertake on this subject will be done
with the same security felt by a man set-
ting out on quicksand, but regardless of any
trepidation we might feel, perhaps some
discussion will not be entirely out of place.
If this turns out to be a defense of fraterni-
ties, it will be based on sincerity, which
neither needs or offers an apology, in spite
of the stand taken by some of the leading
educational institutions in the country.

During the years that fraternities
enough skeletons in their closets to give
their critics ample grounds to call them
sponsors of football heroes and social go-
getters, Their attitude toward scholarship
has been alluded to as wholly passive, if not
unconstructive. And the loyalty of the fra-
ternity has been called narrow and selfish
toward the dishonest or weak brother, and
the fraternity house has been referred to as
a cradle of campus politics. This is not at
all a pretty picture. Nor is it-all true, either

of fraternities in general or of Davidson

frats in particular. Fortunately there is an-
other, a truer, side to the picture.

Dr. Fred H. Turner, Dean of Men at the
University of Illinois, has this to say about
fraternities: “In general the fraternity man

hat about, since any normal student who

is democratic.

desires to be in a fraternity can usually at-
tain membership. He does not have to come
from a wealthy family nor need he be a
good athlete nor the best-dressed man on
the campus. Inter-fraternity relations are
better now than ever before. Many frater-
nity men to help pay their
through college, and the working student
has just as much opportunity to be in a
fraternity as the one who does not work.
From the standpoint of the student, the
fraternity is a good institution; from the
standpoint of the parents of the student, they
can feel that their son in a fraternity is in
good hands; from the standpoint of the
college, the fraternity provides a desirable
type of organization which can do much
to make college life better, more whole-
some and more satisfactory.”

The words of this noted educator could
not be improved upon in describing the
fraternity situation at Davidson. Here,
where the members do not live in the
houses, we avoid nearly all of those things
which have done so much to give fratern-
ities their black eyes and have a set-up
beneficial to the college in. more ways than
one.

Higher Or Lower

Higher education was the objéct of an
attack by the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement This
was based on an intensive ten year study
of 45,000 high school and college students.

The Foundation charged that college stu-
dents preparing to teach were intellectually
inferior to other academic groups, and that

of teaching recently.

the majority of those preparing to teach
were Moing it because they could not do
anything else.

Another criticism made was that college
training injured education in a large number

of cases. To substantiate this claim, test
results showing students making higher

grades as sophomores than seniors were cit-
ed.

Still another criticism was that many who
go to college are the intellectual inferiors
of those who do mot. Yet although these
attacks were founded on extensive investi-
gations, the Foundation did not offer rem-
edies for the deficiencies.

College curricula have been and will con-
tinue to be subject to abusive attacks such
as these, but the gradual evolution brought
about by those who are working for the de-
velopment of better educational opportuni-
ties will do much to decrease them in the
future,

Campus Comments

Davidson has gone far in her hundred
years’ history and started well into the sec-
ond century of her development. Her men
stand high in all walks of life, and in educa-
tional circles fhe name Davidson has come
to stand for big things. No longer is there
a struggle‘for existence, and the administra-
tion can be more or less selective in choos-

ing men to carry on the honors of the
school, But lately, we wonder if our selec-
tive system is carried far enough. Are all

men taken in because they register early
of the same standards as some who do not
enter their names until the summer months ?
Is Davidson really being selective enough?
when Davidson can
be self-confident and yet not cocky in be-
lieving that she should take only the very
best men.

The time has come

As the situation has been in the
past, the first two hundred men or so regist-
ered early’ are investigated, and, if their
high school records prove satisfactory, ad-
mitted. But still anywhere from twenty
to forty of these men have to leave after
the first semester, Have choices really been
selective enough ?

Men are beginning to register now for
the next term of school.

Names of good,
bad, and mediocre students are probably be-
ing received. And admitted applicants
notified when their records have been

are
ex-
amined and approved. Since Davidson can
afford now to be more selective, would it
not be possible to accept all applications up
toa certain date in the summer, and in-
form the applicants that admissions would
be announced-at a later date. With this
plan, more comparisons could be made as
to the desirability of different students, and
in the end a much better group would re-
sult.

Possibly there: would not be the gen-

exodus on the first of
February, and Davidson would gain much
toward her goal of higher scholastic stand-

“We know too well,” says Dean
Ogden, “that football games
bring to college certain young men
who .may_ never taken the
to attend were it for
the fact that they can and like to
play football.
“We know that football
brings other students who, though
they do not play the game, can be
induced to attend college by a once-
a-week opportunity to escape from
the drudgery of learning and ‘let
off steam’ in the football stadium.
But we shall certainly not succeed
in giving an adequate preparation
for modern life to students who are
required only to mark time during
the weekdays, with the promise of
royal-entertainment on Saturday.”

Columbus Ohio—(ACP)—Yes, be-
lieve it or not, today’s co-eds are
in need of men to escort them to
social and good-time functions.
Proof of the fact is a brand-new
survey, made by two Ohio State
University students, J. W. Danner
and Don Zeigler—proof that was
so conclusive to them that they’ve
announced the establishment of an
escort service on the Buckeye
campus.
Of the 213 girls questioned, 109
indicated they would “perhaps”
patronize such a service, and 32
would definitely make use of it.
More than three-fourths of them
would use the service to get a date
for a visiting friend, while half of
them would patronize the services
for themselves.
“Oddly enough, some of the most
popular girls are among the most

“At present Danner. and Ziegler

SUPER SNOOPINGS

By KEN LAWSON

Vacation time is over! After the
two weeks respite furnished by ex-
aminations, the wee stall hours
of Tuesday morning are again en-
livened by the sleepy efforts of the
Davidsonian staff from Editor Mar-
quess down to the lowliest fresh-
man to “get the baby to bed.
Which reminds us of a preplexing
question. Did Master Marquess ac-
quire his bashed brow upholding
the freedom of the press or was
it done in a week-end brawl.

Much water has passed
the bridge since the last key-pound-
ing session. The playing of “Going
Home” as a vesper prelude in hon-
or of the freshmen by Don David-
son, and the Chi Omega party
sprinkled so plentifully with Da-
vidson swains are long past. Even
the phenominal driving of “Barney
Oldfield” the pride of the S.A.E.’s
has lost its punch as column mat-
erial and passed into the limbo of
memories.

But easy times appear ahead:

In the Groove

By TOM PERRIN

MORE FUN..-Social life here-
abouts seems to be taking a healthy
spurt, now that the inmates of this
institution have regard
the placa as a concentration camp
—which it was during exams. This
past week saw dances at Carolina
(both N. and S.), Converse, and an
affair at Limestone. See space just
above for gorier details. The Lime-
stone party in particular, where the
freshmen entertained some half
hundred Davidsonians, looks like
the sort of thing we'd like to have
more of. Pulchritude is plentiful if
not positively universal down there,
they say.

FLOWERS ... And even if you
didn’t read the “Davidsonian” you
would have learned long ago about
the local set from student flower
salesmen. It seems to us that the
faction that wanted to ban flower-
giving, at Mid-Winters missed a
winning argument when they fail-
ed to point out no flowers mean no
flower boys. Maybe, though, we
shouldn't have mentioned that; we'd
hate to have all those nice sales-
men mad at us. Why, we'll bet you

fact-finding and rhyming students
who should be spending more time
on their studies.

For example, an over-ambitious
University of Texas student has
figured out that Longhorn students
(10,103 of them) used 20,000 pen-
cils to write approximately 13,000,-
000 words a day during the recent
10-day mid-term examination per-
iod. They studied 130,000 books for
200,000 hours in preparation for
45,000 examinations.

dom into the junior and senior sec-
tions without hitting a florist’s a-
gent. It would be a nice experi-
ment, anyway.

Seriously, we were a little glad
to see the no-flower movement die
a quiet death this time.

Mid-Winters, where traditionally
every effort is made to put on the
best dance Davidson is capable of,
just doesn’t seem the most propiti-
ous moment to campaign against
this minor expense. Now, for the
spring set, it'll be a different mat-
ter, we believe.

VISITING ROYALTY ... Queens
Day is on us again, and this time
it caught us a little by surprise,
coming at this unusual season. The
damosels have seen us principally as
devotees of sports in the past, if
we remember. Now they’ll glimpse
that true, deep, esthetic nature
which is common, we're sure, to
every D. Gentleman. Davidson has_
so many music lovers who haven't
missed an opera on the campus in
years, (and, to put it bluntly, who
Probably wouldn't miss it if there

Still it should be a very happy oc-
casion for all concerned.

FABLE FOR THE COURT...
Once upon a time there was a
freshman who wore his little red
cap. It was raining, he said, and
he didn’t want to get his good hat
wet.

FOGGY DAY ... Overheard (on
Passing someone, probably Dirty
Dan Cagle, on a campus walk one
of those foggy, drippy, Davidson
mornings) :

“H'l say, old chap, beastly wea-
thaw, what?”

Cheerio.
