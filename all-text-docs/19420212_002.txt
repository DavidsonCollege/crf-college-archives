And What About Social Life?

Social life at Davidson, long operat-
ing under a two strike handicap, is faced
with a state of almost complete stagna-
tion unless one or two simple precautions

are soon taken. The first s

ing feet never trod the hallowed sod

of the Davidson’campus.

Four Pages

A meeting of the five members of the
Publications Board Tuesday for’ the
purpose of discussing The Davidsonian
resulted in the agreement that the news-
paper should appear with four pages
per issue. for the remainder of the year.

Reasons for the change are centered
around the almost complete loss of na-
tional advertisement. | Selling expenses
for soft drinks and candies have been
lumited by the rationing of sugar and
other advertisers have cut down their
selling expenses for other reasons.

Although the size of the publication
will be reduced, the staffeis rather glad
the circumstance which will allow
more selection of stories rather than
depending on nearly all the articles that
are submitted.

In other words, there 7s a bright side
to the change, in that a smaller paper
might best fit. the size of the student
hody. Up to this time the Davidsonian
has been very large as compared withy
other college newspapers’ sizes (i.e.
large in proportion to the number of
students enrolled),

We promise you a smaller, but a better
Davidsonian for the second semester, so
patiently help us weed out the topics
which have the least appeal.

Letter To The Editor

University, Alabama.
February 7, 1941

Mr. Tony Darby, Editor,
THE DAVIDSONIAIN,
Davidson College,

Davidson, North Carolina.

Dear Tony:

Since-fdeaving Davidson a year and a half ago,
I have been a constant readed of The Davidsonian.
It has been a real pleasure to keep up with my
friends and their affairs through your paper.
Many thanks to you and your staff for the grand

job that you are doing,

In looking at The’ Davidsonian week after week,
it has occurred to me that there still remains with
the Davidson student body that ever present ques-
tion: “What can we do on Saturday nights be-
put off that we have been
putting off for thé last month or six weeks?” And
it is only natural that this question has been, still
is, and will continue to be of prime importance.

sides those lessons

Always wanting to do my bit for Davidson, who
did much me, I have pondered greatly
over this question and believe that I have finally
hit upon the answer and complete solution, Put-
ting credit where credit is due, this solution is not
ol my own originality, but is found in a column
of Auburn's PLAINSMAN under the date of Jan-
uary 3, 1942. ‘

that you will pufalish it—merely as a®suggestion

Columnist Martin, not only could the Davidson stu-
dents provide adequate entertainment for them-
selves but they cduld also raise unheard of sums
tor worthy causes. Surely there are public spirited
girls in the town of Davidson or nearby schools
who would co-operate.

With best regards and continued good wishes

for the success of your paper. I remain

This Jungle adventure has been
cut from the same pattern as all
others in the series. This time Tar-
zan routs a band of greedy inter-
lopers, and drives them out of his
jungle kingdom.

The main criticism of this feature
is that the great Tarzan series has

developed into adventure yarns
more suitable to children’s tastes
tan to adults. The scenes have

become repetitions and need an in-
jection of clear originality to pep
up. the outdoor stunts of the jungle

I might have gotten out at the
Mecklenburg Sanitorium, as. Jim
Hogg did his first year). We pro-

ceeded slowly and cautiously, care-
fully watching for some sign of
activity. We were on what our
catalog calls “one of the finest hard-
surfaced roads in the state of North
Carolina.” Finally, we found our-
selves gliding ‘neath the famed trees
that flank Main Street. We saw
the water tank, properly inscribed
with class numerals and “Beat Win-
sock,” the cemetery, and numerous
old rather pretty, houses. As we
passed the North Gate to the cam-
pus,,"we saw a number of the in-
mates standing on the street corner
flexing their thumbs in ‘the direction
of what I now know is Charlotte.
I suppose that there will always be
someone on that corner as long as
there is a Davidson and as long
as there is a city as vice-ridden as
Charlotte. If ever a statue is

erected in Davidson, it ought to be
on that corner, showing a student
flexing his thumb, head bared, ov-
ernight bag on the ground. How-
ever, we paid these people no heed
and proceeded-to turn in the gate,
finally coming to rest in front of
the great Chambers Building. I was
met by a fellow who told me that,
he was a member of the “Y” Cab-
inet. He escorted me into the ad-

* ministrative wing of the great build-

ing and there I made my first pay-
ment, was given the key to my room
on a fourth floor ward and told to
proceed to the Student Store. I
found the student store to be a small
hole in that brick wall —behind

two smiling older students, who al=
though possessing the Christian
faith, seem to embrace some of the
more outward characteristics of the
