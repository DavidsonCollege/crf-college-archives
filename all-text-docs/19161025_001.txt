Citadel and Davidson
Battle to a Tie Score

Visitors’ Forward Passes, Black’s
Run the Features.

Before one of the largest crowds seen
here in recent years. Davidson and the
Citadel played a 7 to 7 tie Saturday in
the only contest to be staged on the local
field this season. ‘The game, from ai
spectator's standpoint, was replete with
thrills, the open form of play being used
to a large extent thruout the game.

‘The Red and Black team forged
ahead in the second quarter by nature
of “Jack” Black’s 86-vard run for a
touchdown, and it seemed that this was
to be the only score of the game, as the
ball see-sawed up and down the field,
Davidson = gaining at straight football
and Citadel offsetting these gains by
successful forward passes.

But the Citadel team. having staked
their all on an aerial game, were enabled
to score a touchdown in the last few
minutes of play on one of their many
long and perfectly completed forward
passes.

The Davidson offense did not show
the powerful drive that had character-
ized thir play in previous contests, but
even at that they easily excelled — the
South Carolinians at straight football.
In the open form of plav, however, Cit-
adel had decidedly the better of the
argument, their complex and variegated
system of forward passes being too much
for the Red and Black team to cope
with.

The individual and particular feature
of the game was Black's 86-yard run ‘for
a touchdown. Tt came in the second
quarter. With the ball on Davidson’:
20-vard line, “Tack.” aided by good in-
terference, carried the ball around right
end. Giving a wonderful exhibition of
sidestepping, he passed one white line
after another, until he had outdistanced
his many pursuers and fallen across the
goal line. It was a play thar will lone
be remembered in Davidson's. athletic
history.

Captain Weeks was largely responsi-
ble for the successful offensive work of
the Citadel team. His field generalshin
was superb and his forward passes al-
most invariably were accurate and weil
placed. Switzer. the big fullback, was
the only gaining member at straight foot-
ball, and he charged hard and low. The
work of Crouch and Teter at ends ap-
proached the sensational. these men han-
dling forward pases with almost uncan-
ny accuracy. “Billy' Sayad's playing
for Davidson was the feature of fhe
dav's line work.

Dear Sir: We notice in your
issue of recent date that the Com-
missarv has offered a prize for the
best Davidson song composed by
November rst. This is a mighty
good movement, for Davidson has
long been in need of some good
“original” songs.

We also think that Davidson is
in need of one first-class college
yell, something similar to the Prince-
ton “Locomotive” or the ‘Wah-
Who-War”™ of Virginia. But it
should be original, and worthy of
the name that it bears.

So we offer one (1) ten pound
box of our Red Eye Tobacco to the
student or alumnus that composes
the best original Davidson yell, the
Blue Pencil Club to be the judges.
The contest to close December ist.
Yours verv truly,

Taytor BrotrHers.

With Pool Later.

‘The plans for the new $25.000 Gyin-
nasium have not been definitely decided
upon. On account of the increased cost
ut building material it will be impossible
to build a Gymnauism as large as was
first planned and include the swimming
pool at the present time. Dr. Martin
asked the Student Body for an capres-
sion of opinion as to what would would
be best: a large Gvmnasium now and
a swimming pool later on, or.a smaller
Gymnasium with a swimming pool. Vhe
vote showed that the student body favors
a large Gymnasiunt,

Dr. Martin has not definitely decided
on the plans that he will submit to the
executive committee of the college, but
in general the plan of the building wilt
probably be as follows: A building 9o,
by y5§ feet. On the first floor the gym
nasium = proper will be 60 by 90 feet.
There wil be a smaller pzymnasiuns, 26
by 31, for boxing, wrestling, ete. On
this floor will be an office for the physical
instructor and an examining reom,

On the Aoor above will be a bed room
for the physical director, and a large
class room for use by the athletic classes
and as a cluh reom for the wearers of
the D. On three sides of the building will
be a gallery for the accommodation ot
visitors,

The plans for the basement: are net
ver settled. Le will probably contain
about 300 lockers, a shower reom, a
room for the use of the home team and
one for the visiting team,

A building committee will be appoint
ed the gist of October.  ‘Vhese plans
will be perfected then, aid work will
begin a few weeks afterwards.

DAVIDSON COLLEGE DAY
CELEBRATED. TOMORROW

‘Tomorrow. October 26th, has been
set aside this vear for the annual cele
bration of Davidson College Dav. ‘Phe
principle feature of the day will be an
address by Dr. Thornton Whaling, of
Columbia, S. C., who is a very attractive
and interesting speaker. Dr. Whaling
was amember of the class of 1877, and
was a class-mate of President Woodrow
Wilson. He: is now the president of
Columbia Theological Seminary.

Another feature of the day will be the
singing of college songs by the Student
Body, and the men are asked to bring
their hand-bhooks to the meeting.

The exercises will begin at 11:30,
classes for the day being suspended at
11 o'clock. There will be no chapel be-
fore breakfast.

Chief of Police Johnston has deter-
mined to see that the law regulating the
speed limit of automobiles thru Davidson
is enforced. A few Sundays ago he took
the numbers of about forty cars that
were exceeding the specd limit. five of
which were Davidson cars. The citi-
vens of Davidson stand hehind Mr.
Tohnston in his efforts, and it is
hoped that the nuisance will soon be
abated.
