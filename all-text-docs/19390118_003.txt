Harry Hendrick, Junior:

“If the student body would only
stop to think for a moment before
giving vent to their feelings con-

injustice on the part of the officials,
it would do much to put an end to
a practice which is harmful not
only to the spirit of which we are
justly proud, but is also causing and
meriting sarcastic comment by out-
siders on the Wildcat spirit and
Davidson gentlemen.

“It is evident that the conduct in

spectators—either pro or con—at
