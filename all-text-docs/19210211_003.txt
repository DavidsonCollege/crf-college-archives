Phi Society.

The oratory of Burney and the elo-
quence of Harold McKeithan made last
Thursday night’s program of the Phi
Society unusually good.

The query for discussion was, Re-
solved: That the United States should
cancel the war debt owed her by the
Allies.

Under the able leadership of “Link”
Taylor the affirmative brought out the
following points: That the United States
could and should start the wheels of
progress moving by cancelling the afore-
said debt; that, as the United States
has already done so much for the Allies,
the proposed measure would work no
additional hardships on the United
States; that mutual benefit would fol-
low the cancellation of the debt.

The negative, under the guidance of
Burney, advanced these reasons why the
United States should frot cancel the
debt: first, that the internal financial

importance than the needs of Europe;
sccond, that the United States is under
no obligation to cancel this debt; that
the Allies have gained enough to keep
them from needing relief from this bur-
den.

The decision was unanimous for the
negative.

Resolved: That movies are uplifting
to humanity, was extemporaneciously de-
bated by Harold McKeithan and C. G.
Brown. McKeithan, upholding the nega-
tive, claimed that movies are aducation-
al and that they teach moral lessons.
Cc. G. Brown attacked movies on the
ground that they have a strong tendency
toward evil for both young and old. The
decision was two to one for the affirma-
tive.

G. M. Hodgin and P. C. Henderson de-
livered splendid declamations. D. R.
Freeman gave an excellent exhibition of
oratory in his timely oration.

The meeting Thursday night, Feb. 10th
will be given over to the election of of-
ficers. Full attendance is desired at
this important meeting.

Eu Society.

The constitution of the Eu Society
was presented, after a thorough re-
vision, for adoption at the last meet-
ing of this organization. The articles in
their new form were accepted unan-
imously. The body of the constitution
as it now stands is much shorter than
formally, a large part having been trans-
ferred to the by-laws.

Another important matter, the time of
meeting, was voted upon, Hereafter the
Eu meetings will be held at eight o’clock
each Saturday evening instead of six
forty-five.

The program was unusually good, con-
sisting of a debate on the subject, “Re-
solved, that the United States should
cancel the war debt of her allies,” and a
declamation on Robert E. Lee.

Those supporting the affirmative side
of the debate query were Phillips, War-
ren, and Elkins; those defending the
negative were Bailey, J. C, Fain, and
Sharpe. America’s obligation to her
allies and her ability to cancel the war
debt constituted the principal arguments
of the affirmative. On the other hand,
the bad effect on our allies and the large
sum to be cancelled were the points ad-
variced by the negative. The negative
received the decision of the judges.

Kretchman’s declamation on General

needs of the United States are of more’

Lee was well delivered and was well
suited to an audience of Southern men.

SIGMA UPSILON AND THE

BOOKLOVERS’ CLUB TO

HOLD COMBINED MEETING | Sunday 236 men attended these classes.

Sigma Upsilon, the college literary
fraternity, and the Booklover's Club,
an organization composed of town
ladies, will hold a combined mecting in
the Civic League Hall, on the night of
February 22d. This is the first joint
meeting ever held by the two organiza-
tions and the members of both are look-
ing forward with pleasure to this in-
novation.

In addition to the regular literary
program, several attractive musical fea-
tures are being arranged. |

JOURNALISTIC FRATERNITY
DISCUSSES FUTURE WORK

The Delta Pi Kappa journalistic fra-
ternity held its regular mecting on the
night of February ist in the Kappa
Alpha hall. The proposed activities of
the fraternity were fully discussed and
a tentative program was made out.

The phases of journalistic life on the
campus were discussed and various
plans suggested by which Delta Pi Kap-
pa could be of much force in literary
production at Davidson. The fraterni-
ty also hopes to inoculate into the minds
of its members during the spring term,
a working knowledge of the laws and
principles of journalism.

SALEM Y. W. C. A. HEARS
DAVIDSON VOLUNTEERS

Roberts and Miller Talk on General
Subject of Missions.

On Friday night Dave Roberts and
Dwight Miller visited Salem College at
Winston and both spoke to the young
ladies there at their regular Y. W. C. A.
service. The general subject of mis-
sions was discussed. The object of the
meeting was to interest the young
ladies in mission work and later to get
a Volunteer Band organized there.
These fellows were sent by the David-
son Volunteer Band, and the meeting
there was held under the auspices of the
Salem Y. W. C. A.

Both fellows report a delightful trip.
As “P. D.” expressed it, “Who could help
it with a hundred and seventy-five
American Beauties all around him?”
“P. D.” also says that when he and
Dave ate in the dining room Friday
night, two against a hundred and seven-
ty-five, Dave's knife and fork were
prone to rattle. At his request the re-
porter did not ask Dave how “P. D.’s”
knife and fork behaved.

COLORED MAN’S ATTITUDE TO
BE PRESENTED TO STUDENTS

Dr. H. L. McCrory, of Biddle Uni-
versity, to Speak to “Y” Sunday.

At the service Sunday evening
Dr. H. L. Meirgry, president of Biddle
University in lottee, will address
the Davidson studs igiving them some
idea of the way the negre goks upon the
relation between himself
man. The object of having thiddy
er here is to bring to our studentt

clearer idea of the other side of they

racial question that is before us at
this time. Davidson men will have to
consider this matter from time to time
and the address at this time should be
very helpful in promoting a proper un-
derstanding of the question on our part.

Accompanying Dr. McCrory will be a
quintette of his singers from Biddle
is the Colored Presbyterian University
in the South and these five singers come
from the theological department. Biddle
singers have quite a reputation and their
singing should contribute in no small
way to a successful meeting.

It is hoped that a large number of
students will be present to hear the ad-
dress and the singing.

There’s a Senior at Dennison who
claims the “bumming” record for the last
football season. He “bummed” more
than a thousand miles and attended
every game without paying a cent of
railway fare—The Torch.
