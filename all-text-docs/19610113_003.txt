Three Happy Endings

AND WHO SAID this hasn't been a goog year for
Davidson teams? An All-American (see story below) and
two pro football draftees are proof enough for me that
the Wildcats have been hitting on all cylinders. The |
latest news eked out this week: All-Conference end Dan- |

sons. Also, junior center Tom Simpson has been dratt-| meant when he said he'd try ©@"

THE BIG DAY for Pete Whittle is Jan. 28. At that |
time the affable holler-boy of the Davidson athletic staff !
leaves for a semester sabbatical at three schools in Geor-
gia and Florida. He will study and observe the programs
of track, intramural sports, physical education and gym-
nastics at Emory Florida and Florida State. An old dog
in experience (31 years) but not in age, Whittle expects
to learn some new tricks which may help our athletic
program.

him, is “tough — tougher'n)

Parker rates the Bulldogs as
the tougher of the two visiting

He stops short of any sing-

saying, “Sure as I do, some-

The visitors will feature a
well-balanced team with excel-
