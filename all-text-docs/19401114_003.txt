EU MEETING POSTPONED

Due to the YMCA Fall Serv- . Fh

ices which were held Tuesday soe
through Thursday, the Eumen- f
ean Literary Society did not Jj \:
hold its regular weekly meet-
ing; however, the usual sched-
ule will be resumed next Tues-
day.
According to Johnnie Moore,

president of the society, several
papers will be read by neo-
phytes, or students seeking ad-
mittance to the literary order.
Among these will be one by Ben
Washburn on the “Influences of
the Latin Language on Eng-
lish,” also one by Alva Lump-
kin on “United We Stand.”

An Armistice Day program
had been planned for this week’s
meeting but will not be pre-
sented next week. Moore said
that he was glad “that the meet-
ing was postponed for an Ar-
mistice Day program is not ex-
actly fitting in times such~+as
these.”
