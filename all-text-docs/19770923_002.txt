—Snow promises refunds

Subscription refunds for the
satirical newspaper/magazine,
The Colostomy, should be in
the mail in the near future,
promises Tony Snow '77, edi-
tor of the magazine.

The Colostomy was a pub-
lishing endeavor initiated last
fall by a group of students who
perceived a need for a hu-
mor/satire publication on the
Davidson campus. Although
approximately one hundred
subscriptions were sold to
College students, the paper

was never printed.

Snow spoke about the pa-
per: ‘"I want to get it off of my
back. It’s a matter of trying to
get the (subscription) checks.’’

Snow explained that the
subscription money (approxi-
mately $300) is in an account
co-signed by himself and Mike
Morris. (Morris graduated fall
term 1976.) Snow said that
Morris came to Davidson with
the checks last year, but never
got in touch with him to
obtain the list of subscribers
and their 76-77 Davidson ad-
dresses. .

Snow will be out of the
country for the next couple of
years and will leave Morris to
take care of the subscription
refunds.

‘I’m going to mail the
subscription list to him and let
him take care of it. I don’t
want it,’’ Snow said.

“TI guess you have to have
more discipline to be an editor
of something like that. I
single-handedly wrote 2% is-
sues--but I couldn't get people
together to get it published,”
he commented.

RHC, DSCnowindependent

The Residence Hall Council
(RHC) and its former subcom-
mittee the Dorm Social Coun-
cil (DSC) which serve to
provide physical improve-
ments as well as social-educa-
tional events within the
dorms, are now operating as
separate groups. |

In order. for the councils to
provide more effective service,
the DSC has been placed
under the auspices of the
College Union, which has al-
ways provided it operating
funds. The RHC is funded by
the Activities Tax. Council. ~

Despite their separation,.
the duties of both councils will
remain the same.

SGA Vice-President and
Chairman of the RHC, Bruce
Brown, stated that the council
ig composed of one elected
representative from each dorm
and three from Belk. He said
that it would continue in its

function of providing ‘‘dorm

and recreational improve-
ments” as well as serving as a
‘“‘continuing liason between
(Director of Student Housing)
Scotty Nichols, (Director of
Facilities and Planning) Gro-
ver Meetze and the students in
areas such as heating, room
maintenance, and off-campus
housing maintenance.”

RHC'’s official budget for
this year is $1500, which will
be used for dorm lounge
improvements (television, fur-
niture), kitchen facilities for
the dorms, and recreational
equipment such as the ping
pong table installed in Belk
this week,

Future plans may include
the installation of a centrex

link all college phones with a
central switchboard, and a
buying service for items such
as refrigerators and lumber
which would allow students to
purchase these items whole-
sale.

The council, composed of

volunteer members, will use
its $1000 budget to «‘supple-
ment hall parties and sponsor
campus-wide events,’’ ac-
cording to DSC chairperson
Mary Chester Morgan.
Morgan sees the DSC as a
means ‘‘to promote dorm uni-
ty’’ and give students a chance
to meet their neighbors. The
DSC caters mostly to upper-

phone system which would classmen since the freshmen °

have special social monies
allocated to them by Dean of
Students Will Terry.

Campus events sponsored in
the past by the DSC have
included a pumplin carving
contest, frisbee contest, and

“Registration dates changed

Students will register for winter term courses from N ovember
2-8, instead of in October as previously announced.

Vice-President for Academic Affairs Price Zimmerman
announced the change yesterday, commenting that, ‘The
purpose of this change is to allow students, and particularly
freshmen, more time for reflection before making up their minds
as to what courses to take next term.”’ ‘‘It was felt,’’ he
continued, ‘‘that four weeks were not a long-enough experience
with a course or subject matter to make choices regarding
continuance.

“Our hope is that with more time to make a realistic appraisal
of interests, students will make more definitive choices at
registration and thereby lessen the pressure during the drop-add
period."

He indicated that the change would be made on an
experimental basis. “‘The earlier date for registration has been
used up to now because the bookstore needs six weeks in order
to order the books in time for them to be on the shelves by the
beginning of class."

‘With a later registration the bookstore will have to guess the
enrollment based on past experience and the professors’
estimates. If it does not work out, we will have to revert to the
previous earlier date.”

Legislature increases grant

The North Carolina Legislature has increased by $100 the
amount of the state tuition grant awarded to all North Carolina
students. This action brings the total amount granted to North
Carolinians to $500.

___ Three hundred dollar grants are given to students regardless
of need, and an additional two hundred dollars for each state
resident attending a private college is placed into a fund and
awarded to students on the basis of need.

Davidson College President Samuel R. Spencer, Jr. served for
the past two years as chairman of the North Carolina
Association of Independent Colleges and Universities and
placed in key role in the funding increase.

mal bid system. Fraternities,
they said, tend to fragment
students.

These students agreed with
the sentiments expressed in a
speech last week by College
President Samuel R. Spencer,
Jr., who said that Davidson’s
old fraternity system “chan-
neled loyalties narrowly, in-
sulated people, and prevented
students from making broader
friendships."’

Spencer warned that any
return to formal bidding would
stir again those evils. ‘I am
strongly convinced that it
would be a serious mistake to
take even one step backward
toward a system of. formal
exclusion,” he said.

Next Monday the Advisory
Council will consider the re-
port of the Patterson Court
Subcommittee and. determine
if it wishes to make a recom-
mendation to the Board of
Trustees at its October 7
meeting.

““We went to the Board of Governors of the University of
North Carolina and said we would like to add $100 for next year
and another $100 for the year after that,” explained Spencer.

The legislature was relunctant to commit itself that far,
however, and only passed the first $100 slated for this year. It is
hoped that if money is available the second $100 amount will be
granted. ,

Council sets agenda

- Ten major areas of campus life will be considered by the
Council on Campus and Religious Life this year, said Dean of
Students Will Terry.

‘We divided the work into ten areas and asked members to
indicate their interests,”’ said Terry. Council members will work
in subcommittees before bringing their area topics before the
entire council.

Dean Terry outlined the following areas in a recent meeting:
. The College's Christian commitment
. Patterson Court and self-selection
. College Union— How is it fulfilling its role on campus?

. Language houses— Whether and how to create them

. The Freshman Hall concept

. Food service

. Several kinds of different experiences of groups on campus:

the black experience, Jewish and international students

8. Student health service

9. Behavior in dorms— What does that reflect? —our lacks and
our assets

10. Continuation with the study of coeducation

Fhe term *‘€ampus and Religious Life's defined in the-——

Student Constitution: ‘‘as all those extracurricular policies,

programs, ...campus activities which have as their aim the

enrichment of the spiritual, social, and cultural lives of the

college community and its individual members.”
