‘ Capsule Courses, Trips

By BILL SEIGLER
Associate Editor

Arrange a trip te New Or-
leans for 65 alumni to see Da-
vidson in the Sugar Bowl
Tournament.

Arrange for a_ thousand
alumni and their families to
stay on campus for three days
the weekend after graduation,
providing a series of capsule
courses taught by Davidson
professors and arranging
tenth, 25th. and 50th class re-
unions.

Try to induce each of the
50 alumni chapters to meet
once a year, and keep them
posted on what the college is
doing.

This is the beginning of the
description of the job of alum

Graduate Influence Extensive,
But Quiet, Behind The Scenes

By FRANKLIN ANDERSON

Asst. Managing Editor

How much do atumnt in-
fluence the policy of David-
son?

Extensively, but the in-
fluence is quiet and behind
the scenes: almost like an
‘unwritten agreement among
the alumni.

“The president and trustees
are sensitive to intelligent
comments from alumni, stu-
dents and faculty."’ mused
Assistant to the President
William L. Bondurant as he
collected his thoughts.

“I am not aware of any
coup d’etats which have been
brought about by alumni.”
he continued. There has never
been ‘‘an effort to stack the
Board of Trustees, or put un.
due pressure on the presi-
dent's office."’

‘In some cases, I'm sure
alumni influence is substan-
tial,’ said former DAVID.
SONIAN editor and Wildcat
Club president Edward Sut-
ton.

Commenting on a_ letter
writing campaign last year
during the debate on subsi-
dized athletics, he explained
that there had been no or-
ganized effort to encourage
letters, but that the directors
of the Wildcat Club had writ-.
ten.

“I think it had some influ-
ence—I don't know if it was
decisive,” Sutton added. The
faculty petitioned the trus-
tees for a cessation of the
subsidizing last year, and
the petition was signed
by most of the faculty. The
trustees voted to maintain the

Sutton qualified his re-
marks on alumni power,

maintaining that they had as
much interest in the college
as any professor, and point-
ing out their financial con-
tributions, but also indicating
that no one group—students,
administration, faculty, or
alumni—should have decisive
power.

Bondurant pointed to the
continuity of policy in the col-
lege as evidence that alumni
do not swing the administra-
tion and trustees back and
forth. ‘The college has a
record of not making many

ly, carefully, and deliberate-

by the large number of pres-

A large poftion of the in.
fluence is a result of the work
which alumni do in raising
money. “‘The amount of. time
they put in the Ford Chal
lenge is amazing to me.”
Bondurant said.

“The alumni serve as a
major factor in the ongoing
of the college,"’ Bondurant
continued. ‘‘It is beyond ques-
tion that Davidson's growth
and development to the ad-
vantageous position it now
holds, is due to the alumni
over the years.”

The alumni weekend; begun
five years ago under William

Short courses are offered to

“Corporations: Competition

Dr. Cora Nelson. A course on

Board of Trustees and the

It is this kind of control
which the ‘continuity of po-
licy"’ demonstrates. Letter.
writing campaigns have not
noticeably influenced the
policy of the college, except
to strengthen or reaffirm a
policy which is already in
existence.

However, the influence is
becoming more moderate.
The percentage of faculty
which is Davidson graduates
has been steadily dropping:
Out of nine new faculty mem
bers this year. only one was
a Davidson graduate.

The policy of hiring former
Davidson students as faculty

members has heen sharply

criticized by students. Last
year’s Brown Ground Report,
issued by students to comple-
ment the Blue Sky study. ac.
cused the faculty of being
“inbred to the point of
idiocy.’ Only 29 of the 84
members of the faculty are
now Davidson graduates, but
these 29 occupy influential
positions.

and is available to alumni as
well as students. According
to Armstrong. requests come
regularly for prospective job
applicants who have graduat-
ed from Davidson several
years ago, but the problem
is communicating the infor-
mation to the alumni who
might be interested.

Keeping tabs on 12,000
alumni is a massive job
which employs three people
full time at tasks which in-
clude sending bibs to new ba-
bies, channeling requests for
basketball tickets, and pro-
gramming the computer.

From the time a_ student
leaves Davidson, he is track-
ed, primarily through the use
of information he leaves with
the college in a pre-gradua-
tion questionnaire. Presently
on file in the alumni office is
information on every student
for the past 67 years.

Addresses are traced
through the post office and
through the names of two
contacts whose name the stu.
dent leaves the college.

Information on students is
gathered by a newspaper
clipping service, and by go-
ing through discarded North
and South Carolina newspa-
pers which the library does
not have.

Four times a year the alum.
ni bulletin is. sent out to all
alumni, and in the past two
years, there have been more
than 5.000 address changes.

The computer has permit-

ted the alphabetizing of the

Attention is given to the
Alumni Association because
of its power, which rests
largely on two pillars—its fi-
nancial support and election
of trustees. Individual alumni
not only contribute financial-
ly to the college. but many
have assisted in fund rais-
ing drives and have helped
petition foundations for
grants.

But perhaps the most im.
portant source of power
comes from power to elect
men to the Board of Trustees.
the governing body of the col-
lege. The charter of David-
son College empowers the as-
sociation to elect some of its
members to the board. The
number was set at 12 by the
trustee by-laws.

Of these 12, all must be
members of an ‘evangelical
church." Alumni trustees
serve four-year terms, and
are limited to three consecu-
tive terms, After a third con-
secutive term. an alumni
trustee is ineligible for re-
election for one year. Four
of the 12 current alumni
trustees are from North Caro-
lina. The youngest is a mem-
ber of the class of 1952—Hugh
Cannon.

Other than fund-raising,
alumni groups sponsor activ-
ities such as receptions for
prospective students. Recent-
ly the Charlotte chapter hon
ored a group of professors
for their contribution to the
school.

Local chapters also serve
as channels of communica.
tion between Davidson and
‘its graduates. Recently, Dr.
Frontis Johnston, dean of the

faculty. spoke to several
chapters on the Blue Sky
proposals.

Financial Role Exceeds
One-Sixth Contribution

By RICHARD COWART
Staff Writer

Although Davidson's alum-
ni contribute only one-sixth
of the college's income. they
play an important role in the
financial life of the school.

This is according to Robert
J. Sailstad, who as director

Alumni Organization Is
Influential

Wide-!

By BOB REID
Managing Editor

When a student leaves Da-
vidson, he becomes part of a
large, well-organized body
which, by its power to elect
trustees, could wield consid-
erable influence on the life of
the college.

That body is the National
Alumni Association, a non-
dues paying organization
which is divided into 50 local
chapters from the Atlantic to
Kansas City and from New
York to Florida.

Graduation from Davidson
is not a necessary qualifica-
tion for membership. Accord-
ing to Article III of the as-
sociation’s constitution. all
persons who “‘have attended
or who may hereafter attend
Davidson College as regular
students for as much as one
academic year’ are mem-
bers. Recipients of honorary
degrees are eligible too.

Controlling the organization
are a president. president-
elect. board of directors and
two vice-presidents. The
president and vice presidents
are elected at the annual
association meeting during
Homecoming. The director of
alumni affairs serves as
secretary.

The president and his offi-
cers are free to manage their

pread,

affairs without official regu-
lation by the college. The
current president is Samuel
Hemphill '39 of Hickory. The
president-elect. who will
serve as president next year.
is B. G. McClintock. ‘40 of
Greenwood. S. C.

The president-elect and vice
presidents are elected by
mail ballot before the Home-
coming meeting. Members
vote for three men, arid the
candidate with the greatest

number of votes becomes

president. ’

Between annual meetings
the affairs of the association
are managed by the board of
directors. The board is com-
posed of the current officers
and past presidents of the as-
sociation, alumni. trustees.
current presidents of the local
chapters, presidents of senior
classes and student councils
for the preceeding five years
and three alumni from the
faculty or administration who
are appointed by the associa-
tion president.

Among their duties, board
members must nominate can-
didates for offices in the as
sociation.

Of course, not all the alum-
ni remain actively interested
in. Davidson. According to
alumni ‘affairs personnel.
graduates who live close to
Davidson are usually the
most active. With a few ex-
ceptions, most alumni leaders
are from the two Carolinas,

according to association pub
lications.

Rule Allows Student Vote

Provisions in the constitution of the
Alumni Association will apparently en-
able students to vote in alumni elec-
tions, it was discovered this week.

These elections include the annual
election of the alumni officers and three

trustees.

The part of the constitution which
may enable the change defines a mem-
ber of the Alumni Association as any
person who has attended Davidson for
a complete term during an academic
year, including special students.

William

former alumni director and assistant to

the president, Armstrong was told by

Bondurant that the interpretation al-

lowing for student voting was correct.
The provisions in question read:

“The members of the Association
shall consist of all persons who (1) have
attended or who may hereafter attend
Davidson College as regular or special
students for as much as one academic
year during one or more than one regu-
lar session and/or (2) have received or
may hereafter receive an Honorary De-
gree conferred by the Board of Trus-

“Each member of the Association
shall have one vote as to the election of

or issue properly coming before the

and development office di
rects the fund-raising opera-
tions of the school.

“Don't underestimate the
importance of alumni giv-
ing.’’ he said. ‘‘The little gifts
are more important than the
dollars involved."

Alumni contributions are
overshadowed by huge do-
nations from large founda.
tions. But without alumni sup
port, Sailstad said. these
foundations would not con.
tribute to Davidson.

“Foundations won't give a
college which isn’t supported
by its own alumni.” he said.
Gifts from _ foundations
amount to nearly two-thirds
of Davidson’s income, he add-
ed.

Davidson graduates also
help administer fund-raising
drives. During the Ford Chal-
lenge/drive last year, David-
son alumni organized local
committees in several cities
and states and contacted oth.
er graduates to appeal for
contributions. More than 1,000
alumni solicited funds during
the drive, Sailstad said.

He added that the reputa-
tion of Davidson alumni en-
courages foundations to con-
tribute. The personal achieve.
ments of Davidson alumni in
business, education and the
church draw attention to the
college, he said.

Most alumni gifts are fun-
neled into the current operat-
ing budget. Sailstad added.
Certain large donations are
tagged for financing special
projects and improvements.
such as dormitories and ath
letic fields.

Alumni funds are pooled
into the Living Endowment
Fund, Sailstad explained.
From this fund the college
draws resources to pay for
such things as athletics, fac.
ulty salaries and mainte
nance.

In recent years there has
been a marked increase in
percentage of contributing
alumni and the amount of

their contributions. Sailstad
said.

In 1956, 20 per cent of the
alumni gave a total of $80,000
to the collége. But in 10
years, the percentage jumped
to nearly 40 per cent. The
contributions totalled $220.-

000.

There are two basic rea
sons why alumni give money
to the college. he said. The
first is that the alumni re:
tain an “honest emotional at-
tachment to the college.”’ The
second, he added, is, that
alumni want to see Davidson
progress.

“They want to give to Da-
vidson,”’ he concluded. ‘‘be
