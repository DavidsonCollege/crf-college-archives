Mid Semester Marks
Will Be Posted Soon

The next report of grades will be re-
leased about November 25, according
to an announcement made by Mr. F. W.
Hengeveld, Registrar and Secretary of
the Faculty.

These grades will constitute the regu-
lar mid-semester report and will cover
all the work done so far this year, in-
cluding two reviews and all daily grades.

The grades will be posted as usual in
the books in Mr. Hengeveld’s office, so

calling by this office at any time after
the twenty-fifth. Grades for all classes
will be posted at the same time. A copy
of each student's report will be mailed to
his parent or guardian.

until the semester report comes out after
examinations, during the latter part of
January. The semester exams will be in
session very shortly after the return from
the Christmas holidays.

E tell you that Chesterfield

Cigarettes are made of mild,

ripe tobaccos. We’ve told you about

the paper—that it’s pure and burns
right, without taste or odor.

We have said that Chesterfields are

made right. The tobaccos are aged,
then blended and cross-blended, and

cut into shreds the right width and
length to smoke right.

These things are done to make
what people want—a cigarette that’s
milder, a cigarette that tastes better
—a cigarette that satisfies.

You can prove what we
tell you about Chesterfield.
May we ask you to try them
— that would seem to be fair enough.
