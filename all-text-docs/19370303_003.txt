CHEMICAL FRATERNITY
REPRESENTED BY TRIO
AT DUKE CONVENTION

CHEMICAL HEAD SPEAKS

Duke School of Chemistry
Sponsors Meeting

The Alpha Alpha chapter of
Gamma Sigma Epsilon, na-
tional honorary chemical fra-
ternity, was represented at the
convention at Duke University
by Professors Avery Patton
and Hervey Ross, and J. Mar-
ion Bryant. The meeting was
held Wednesday, Feb. 24, at
the Duke School of Chemistry
in Durham.

The principal speaker was Dr. E,
R. Weidlein of Pittsburgh,  Pa.,
president of the American Chemi-
cal Society and director of the Mel-
lon Institute for Industrial Re-
search. His speech was on the sub-
ject, ‘Science in Action.”

Research Talk

Dr. Weidlein talked about
search made in many industries, and
the excellent restitts obtained from
it. He said that the advertisement
“Reach for a Lucky Instead of a
Sweet” was almost disastrous to the
sugar industry. The consumption
of sugar dropped off so much that
research had to be made to save
the industry. As a result of this
work the industry has been saved
by such things as glue and use in
the rayon field.

Another ‘interesting study was
made of sleep and it was found that
the crawl stroke is most popular
and that a bed too soft will cause
the sleeper to cramp awd wake up.

Glass Products

Safety glass has been perfected,
and now glass cloth is being used
for neckties and other articles. It
hasebeen found that.many of. the
synthetic goods have definite ad-
vantages over the real product. Syn-
thetic rubber is especially useful.

One of the greatest discoveries in
the Mellon Institute is a cure for
pneumonia. It has been perfected
only in the last few months and is
now still being tested. Dr. Weid-
lein said, however, that the tests
have been successful so far. This
cure is a tablet which is taken like
aspirin.

Dr. Weidlein said in closing that
the best way for industry to insure
itself is through research.

Editor Overton and Staff
Again Offer Potpourri of
Wit and Originality

Warning! Don’t go near the Dav-
idson Post office on or about March
15, or the new Spring Issue of
Scripts ’n Pranks will greet you
face to face in your mail box.

Editor Hal Overton says that the
new cover by Ryburn will create
more comment than any cover the
old Yowl ever had; so be sure and
gaze at the cover before opening
the magazine.

There will be cartoons by Ryburn
and Vowles, those vivid portrayers
of scintilating wit, and by Harbin
and Miller, the freshman class’ con-
tribution to the field of
ists.

The genius of Gib’ Smith and
Linwood Brown will again blossom
forth in this issue. Smith’s story
is “Black Love,” a story of slaves,
and Brown's has the interesting
title of “The Gentleman.”* There
will also be poetry by Dallas Her-
ring and Bill MclIlwinen.

All the regular features will be
present. There will be “Music in
the McKnight Manner” for the
moody musicians and Bob Johnston
will again conduct his “Did You
Know That?” column, without
which no Davidson College maga-
zine would be complete. The latter
has been a permanent feature for
the four years, which Bob has been
in Davidson. There will be many
other stories and features, butvEdi-

Pil BETA GONGLAVE

Phi Beta Kappa will hold the
triennial meeting of its National
Chapters this year. The conven-
tion will be in Atlanta, September
8-11. Davidson will be representéd.

The most important business to
come before the delegates of this
convention for many years is sched-
uled for the September conclave. At
that time the constitution’ and by-
laws of the organization will be
under consideration for wholesale
revision.

Davidson’s representatives to the
meeting have not yet"been selected,
but there will be an official delega-
tion from here. This is the first
time in many years that the society
has held its convention in the south,
and this will be a strong incentive
for more members of the scholar-
ship fraternity to attend the con-
vention. As is well known, Phi
Beta Kappa is a group formed only
of those who are outstanding in

Tyler Port says: “At any other

Pete McKnight: “Undoubtedly a
more expedient handling of the
courts and a more liberal attitude
are desirable, but the President's
proposal smacks of sly and under-

able proposal advanced by a leading
economist would be to make it eas-

from one source; another unnamed

Establishes the Close Relation-
ship Between Family
and Religion

Dr, Price H. Gwynn, Professor
Education, addressed the Min-
isterial Band on February 16, on
the subject, “The Disintegration of
the American Family—A Challenge
to” Protestant Christianity.”

The speaker, first having estab-

of

lished the close relationship between
family and religion, attacked Mar-
tin Luther’s statement that the
church has no responsibility of the
success or failure of marriage.

To present the picture of family
disintegration, he pointed out the
condition in regard to divorce alone,
how divorce in America, increasing
yearly, has already far surpassed
the rate in Protestant countries of
Europe. Divorce laws he .called a
“crazy-quilt,” and are probably the
most outstanding examples in the
whole nation of a profitable racket
trading on human failure and mis-
ery.”

As improvement
Dr. Gwynn suggested (1) uniform
marriage laws; (2) uniform divorce

means toward

laws; (3) courts of domestic rela-
tions to handle marital difficulties ;
and (4) a program of education by
the churches.

churches to fight to preserve the

family, based on romantic marriage,
and so to “perpetuate its usefulness
and enrich its contribution to so-
