Eminent Social Scientist Discusses the
Three “Rs”

Dr. Lingle presented Dr. Devine
to the audience as a “statesman and
humanitarian ;” and his lecture bore
out well the statement.

Dr. Devine announced that he
would discuss “Revolution, Reac-
tion and Reconstruction.” He first
spoke of revolution, characterizing
it as a disease more serious than
any scourge that has ever crippled or
destroyed the bodies of men. He
said that revolution may be just and
righteous ; and that it may often be
viewed with respect after it has at-
tained its object; but that a revo-
tionary lack of respect for the con-
stituted authority of a settled gov-
ernment is dangerous; stated that
Burke’s “Reflections on the French
Revolution” was aimed to inculcate
the proper respect for authority. He
assigned as the principal reasons for
the present universal unrest an in-
stability due to the war, the exam-
ple of recent revolutions, the un-
equal division of wealth, and a dis-
appointment at the failure of the,
dreams of freedom.

preservation of what is good.

Reconstruction was then charac-
terized as being as radical as revo-
lution, yet retaining the stability
not to accept a thing merely be-
cause it is new. Dr. Devine said
that we need a national health pro-
gram and national legislation for
health; that we need better educa-
tional facilities; that we must raise
the standards of living of the labor-
ing classes. He said that men were
individually responsible for their ac-
tion; that every citizen must dis-
charge his duty fully.

The large attendance was a sufh-!
cient testimony of the willingness;
of the students to support the fac--
ulty in the effort to have lectures on:
the Hill as in days of yore. The
clear and incisive lucidity with
which the subject was treated was
a source of very genuine satisfaction
to all present.

RECEPTION FOR DR. DEVINE.

‘

Immediately after the fine talk of
Dr. Devine on last Thursday even-
ing a reception was given in his
honor at the home of Dr. T. W.
Lingle for the faculty and represen-
tative leaders of the student body.

After hearing the talk of one of,
America’s great men, it was indeed
a great pleasure to have a personal |
talk with him, and this privilege
every one present had. We are sure
that Dr. Devine enjoyed his stay!
with the Davidson students, and in!
his talk he spoke of them as being a
fine group of young men, so that he
must have gotten a good impres-
sion of us.
- As Dr. Lingle so aptly put it, he,
wanted Dr. Devine to meet the lead- ,
ers. of Davidson in order that he
might form his opinion about us and:
take it back with him.

Those present were as follows:
Misses Mary and Lizzie Young, Miss.
Hattie Thompson, Dr. and Mrs.
Arbuckle, Dr. and Mrs. Richards,
Dr. and Mrs. J. W. MacConnell, Dr
Harding, Dr. J. M. Douglas, Dr.

The punch, cake and candy which
Mrs. Lingle so generously served

that this is a fault quite character-
istic of our time—to fear anything
new. He mentioned the statement
of a United States senator, “This is
no time for new ideas,” as an ex-
ample of blind and selfish reaction.
“We must not refuse a thing,” said
he, “because it is new, nor hold to
another because it is old.” We must
respect the old things that are
worthy, but must accept the new
ideas that prove valuable. We must

UNTERSVILLE
BIG SUCCESS
Large Audience Greets Men.
Concert Full of Davidson Pep.

Credit Due Mr. Freeman.

The Band under the leadership of
Mr. D. R. Freeman gave their first
public concert off the Hill Saturday
evening before a large audience in
the ‘Huntersville Public School
auditorium at Huntersville, N. C.

The program was opened with a
lively, popular air, rendered in pro-
fessional style. This won the ap-
plause of the audience.

During the intermission Messrs.
Cathey and Shields entertained the
audience “while the band rested
their lips,” as Mr. Cathey put it,
with comic songs, and piano selec-
tions by Mr. Shields.

The second part of the program
was rendered equally as well as the
first, each number receiving thun-
derous applause.

The progrim was closed with “O
Davidson,” the band standing while
they played.

Much credit is due Mr. Freeman
for his untiring effort to get the
band in shape for concert work this
year and the Davidson student body
is to be congratulated on having
such an efficient man numbered
among them.

At a recent meeting of the band
officers were elected as follows: Mr.
B. E. Shields, manager; Mr. C. A.
Dunn, assistant manager, and Mr.
D. R. Freeman, director.

Sergeant O’Connell, one of the
tegular army men stationed here
. unit, received
his discharge last week and left for
Sergeant
O'Connell served three years in the
Australian navy before signing up
with Uncle Sam.

A better walk from Eu Hall to
Morrison is badly needed. Why?
Ask any man who tried it Sunday.
