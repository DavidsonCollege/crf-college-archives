Clinton Move 1S
Only the First Step

_ By Chris Hood

President-elect Bill Clinton’s
pledge to overturn a military ban
‘on gays has brought another angle
to the ongoing debate about homo-
sexuality. Nevertheless, the pri-
mary issue here goes far beyond
the military; it is. discrimination
against homo- '

genetic factors. Given these data,
legislation which permits discrimi-
nation against gays appears most
ludicrous.

Those who insist that indi-
viduals choose to be gay could
consider the plight of a. homo-
sexual. Does it seem logical that
one would in-

sexual orientation is dangerously

Pithy Irreverence...

Once Upon A Time At Thanksgiving

There’s a moral in here some-
where.

One year, my dad got the bright
idea that we were going to cel-
ebrate Thanksgiving “the tradi-
tional way.” Y’know, the way the
settlers and Indians used to: out in
the wilderness, trying totrack down
dinner.

I was pensive about the whole
idea. First, I have problems cel-
ebrating the holiday in the first
place. Think about it. The Indians
came to us (“us” being my pilgrim
ancestors), gave us food, taught us
how to survive and held our hand
through the winter, and we took
their land and killed them or gave
them liquor so they could kill them-
selves. So we get off from school.

Second, I don’tconsider hunt-
ing a very fair sport. Maybe if you
had to joust with the deer, or, if
you’re hunting bears, how about
boxing? I guarantee the number of

hunters would decrease exponen- .

tially.

Finally, I’m not a very
wildemessy kind of guy. I like the
Discovery Channel, but that’s
about as far as it goes. I always
imagine myself on a hunting trip,
having the same fate befall me as
that poor woman in Maine who got
shot in her backyard whilst hang-
ing out the laundry.

But my protests fell on deaf
ears (which had no doubt become
that way from the “bang” of firing

guns.) My father.and his:friends

said it would be o-so-fun, and em-
phasized that there would be lots
of beer. So I agreed to go. Sort of
a conscientious subjector, if you
will.

We loaded up the trucks with
the automatic weapons and hand
grenades.. Those turkeys didn’t
have a chance.

The forest air was bracing, the
leaves crunched under our feet and
the smell of a campfire rounded
out the picture nicely.

Those incharge thoughtit wise :

we set out. It was decided we
should split up, apparently to con-
fuse the turkey. Or deer. What-
ever it was we were hunting. I
think the game of the day was
“whatever moves.”

I put on my battery-powered
orange vest with the big flashing

“I’m Not A Deer” sign across the

back and headed out.
So anyway, the long and short
of it is: I became horribly lost. It’s

my gun.

Hmmm, 1 thought. Now I’m
kind of screwed. What would
Daniel Boone doina situation like
this? ¢ The old fashioned method:
that moss-on-the-north-side-of-
the-trees trick. But to my dismay,
no one told modern moss that, in
order to serve as an effective navi-
gational tool, it should only grow
on the northern side.

Just as I was about to give up
hope, out of the wilderness stepped

Bumpocrossed with the drunk guy
in "Blazing Saddles."

Great, maybe he could tell me
where I was.

He walked right up to me,
considered me. “I’m hungry,” he
said, and pulled outa Rambo knife.

I fainted. .

I dreamt of better days, back
when I was in preschool and
Thanksgiving consisted of making
headdresses out of construction
paper and using my hand and that
sour-smelling red paint to stamp
turkeys.

When I came to, Natty was
cooking some sort of rodent on a
spit above a small fire.

“Sorry to scare you,” he said.
“Have some dinner?”

We sat by the fire and ate. I
didn’t ask what it was. And yes, it
did taste like chicken.

We ate in silence. The old
man’s face was weather-worn and
wrinkled and told the story of many
years spent alone in the wild.

We finished and:I asked if
there was a public phone nearby.
He smiled and said “Follow me.”

Itwas becoming dark, the sun-
set beginning to stretch out fingers

‘of red through the mostly leafless

trees. I watched my feet wade
through the sea of brown leaves.
Suddenly, there was a call:
“Any luck?”
I.was back at the campfire,
and a few of “the hunters” were

prodding the embers of a dying

fire, looking cold and miserable.

"Burp." Male bonding

They hadn’t killed anything,
oreven seen anything besides each
other since the moming, and were
accordingly pretty dejected.

“Where’ve you been?” asked
somebody.

“Thanksgiving,” I said.

The moral: Don’tdoanything
stupid on Thanksgiving. Stick to’
tradition. Stay home. Eat ‘till you
wantto puke. Watch football. Like

, our ancestors.
