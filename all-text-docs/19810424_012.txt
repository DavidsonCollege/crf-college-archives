Senator Bayh was active in
social service legislation and in

him organised by the Moral
Majority. .

Bayh’s direct style—one In-
diana citizen commented of
him, ‘‘The man can out-folksy a
pig’’— has made him a popular
speaker.

Senator Bayh will answer
questions following his address
in Love auditorium Monday
night and will be available for
informal discussion on Tues-
day. Check the calendar for
