Tne proposal to establish a Tenure
Committee deserves serious considera-
tion.

No one at Davidson seems satisfied
with the evaluation procedure as it now
stands.

The Administration says it would be
nice to “pass the buck,” to share the
responsibility for unpopular tenure deci-
sions.

The faculty is unhappy because they
perceive that they have little say in who
they will be working with for the next
twenty or thirty years.

Students are concerned about the
procedure as it stands because they feel
their input is neglected.

Yet five years ago when a Tenure
Committee was proposed by Dr. MacCor-
mac, the faculty did not support it.

Any formula for granting tenure will
arouse some controversy but some type
of student/ faculty Tenure Committee
would be a logical and attractive choice
to solve some of the current criticisms.

It is understandable that some faculty
members would be reluctant to serve on
such a committee because of the time it
would involve and the fact that the job
would not be very pleasant. Few people
like to judge their peers or friends.

But the biggest priority here is the
continued excellence of Davidson Col-
lege. If that priority involves some extra
time, the faculty is obligated to make
that time.

Faculty members argue that sensitive
information concerning salaries and
background should not become common
knowledge especially in a small commu-
nity like Davidson. Certainly members on
the committee would be exposed to this
type of information. Therefore, faculty
and students must be careful about their
selection of committee members. They

must select rational and intelligent
committee members who will not divulge
confidential information. |

Many professors also stress that
teaching is their primary responsibility
and that they should not have to bother
with administrative decisions.

We agree that professors’ first priority
is teaching. But we also believe that
those professors who will not lend active
assistance in the governance of a college
have an incomplete and selfish commit-
ment to the academic profession.

The faculty needs to take some
responsibility. Responsibility includes
difficult decisions at times, but this is a
challenge anyone committed to excel-
lence must take.

There is some concern over student
participation in tenure decisions. Two
considerations in granting tenure are
teaching ability and availibility to stu-
dents. Students may not be in the best
position to judge “service to the commu-
nity,’ ‘physical vigor,” or ‘Christian
commitment” but no one is better
qualified to judge classroom perfor-
mance and teaching effectiveness.

Dr. MacCormac’s proposal may not be
perfect. There should, for example, be
careful thought given to student wide
campus elections of committee mem-
bers, since oftentimes students do hot
know who or what they are voting for. Dr.
MacCormac does, however, have the
right idea.

The question will come up at the
faculty meeting Tuesday. Some sort of
student/ faculty committee should be
endorsed. The faculty can either recog-
nize its commitment to the excellence of
Davidson College or slither back into
self-righteous docility.

-— Put an end to library abuse

To the Editor:

With the close of the term
“upon us, and the realization
that seemingly endless pages of
term papers will (in fact, must)
be written in the next few
weeks, comes a more shattering
realization. Library courtesy is
a dwindling virtue at Davidson.

When was the last time you
absconded to your carrel with
every book in the library or, for
example, the Gross National
Product of Ecuador without
checking them out? How is the
next person interested in the
. financial status of Ecuador to

| find the books?

Library workers patrol the
carrels regularly, leaving notes
where books are not checked out
to say that they will return
them to the shelves the- next
time they come by. And these
same library workers recieve
much verbal abuse for uphold-
ing the system of an open,
available library for all.

Are you stashing the 200’s in
the 800’s just to have them for
your own personal carrel-side
library? Books that have been
checked out are far easier to
locate than those hidden within
the library itself. Reading the
shelves for misplaced books is a

time consuming task.
Likewise, have you ever re-
moved a book from the library
without checking it out? Reme-
mber. a library book that has
been on your shelf for a year is
still a library book. It belongs
to the whole of Davidson and
should be available for everyone
to use.
1f you have taken a book from
the library please turn it in. I
daresay that the book drop is
probably a relatively anony-
mous spot at 4 a.m. Whether
you turn yourself in is another
matter—just return our books.

They who have read about
everything are thought to

too, but it is not always so;
reading furnishes the mind
only with materials of

that makes what we read

enough to cram ourselves
with a great load of collec-

Alternative cited for
MCAT test dilemma

To the Editor:

In response to Greg Zeph's
rebuttal to Eric Roskos’ letter
about the use of the art gallery
during the MCAT’s, it seems
that an alternate solution could
have been effected. First we
must examine the facts.

Both the MCAT's and
LSAT’s were shifted from the
Gallery to Dana 114 and 116,
although the Gallery was re-
served for these tests from the
beginning of this year. When
the first half of these tests were

administered, the Gallery. was °

locked. Later we were informed
that Mr. Jackson had requested
that the tests be moved so as
not to disturb the Romare
Bearden Collection.

The MCAT's start at 8 am
and run to 5 pm, with about an
hour for lunch and another for
breaks, paperwork, etc. The
testing is rigorous. If anyone
has tried to sit comfortably in
the seats of Dana 114 for one
hour, let alone tried to juggle
pencils, test booklets, and an-
swer sheets for seven hours, the
psychological handicap (which
could mean the difference be-
tween acceptance and rejection)
is clearly apparent.

Also, although I am right-
handed, Dana 114 has no pro-
visions for those who are left-
handed. When you have a table
on which to spread out your
materials, be you right- or left-

handed, and comfortable seats.,.

you will be better able to work
at your optimum level, which is
a must for these tests.

At the end of the MCAT'’s
were questions designed to ev-
aluate the test center. About 85
people took the MCAT’s. I’m
sure that the majority did not
give our test center a high
rating.

The companies which grade
these tests do not take this
rating into account for the
students’ scores, but may re-
voke the college’s right to
administer the test if its center
is not satisfactory. It would be
a shame if Davidson should
have to send its students to
UNC-Charlotte for the LSAT’s
and MCAT's.

Herb has gotten a lot of
criticism over his actions re-
cently, but it's obvious that he

believes that what he is doing is
best for the college.

But if the Gallery can be
trusted for student use for
Coffee and Cokes, why can't it
be used for important tests like
the LSAT’s and MCAT's? In
the case that these tests be
moved, discussion with people
like Dr. Frederickson could aid
in deciding how to put David.
son's resources to the best
possible usage.

The solution I propose,
should this situation arise a-
gain, would be to shift the hours
the Chambers Art Gallery is
open from the 2-5 pm regular
hours to a 5:30-9:30 slot, allow-
ing the alumni a chance to view
such a famous collection (also
allowing students on work-stu-
dy such as Greg to maintain
financial aid), yet providing a
better testing environment for
students taking MCAT’s,
LSAT’s, GRE’s, etc. A sign or
two by the Alumni Registration
Area would keep the noise to a
nondistracting level. Since the
Gallery's partitions (on - which
the paintings are mounted) are
on rollers, it is a simple matter
to move these against the walls,
and to set up tables and chairs
for testing.

Finally, Eric Roskos did not
provide the title for that article,
and his criticism was less aimed
at Herb than at the idea that in
his opinion, Davidson did not
provide the best for its students
in this case.

What about
our sports?

To the Editor:

In deference to Bad Bernie
and Hogman’s frolicsome intra-
mural insights we make it a
point to read the Men's IMAC
Report at least twice for laughs.
So who cares about women’s
athletics anyway?
