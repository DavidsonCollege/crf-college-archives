Victorious-Union leaders

outline smooth transition

By AMANDA HALL
Sports Editor

.Billy Hutchings, Mark Tyn-
dall and Olivia Ware have won
the positions of Union Board
President, Social Vice Presi-
dent and Co-Curricular Vice-
President. The new officers
will move into office in Jan-
uary.

Hutchings is working close-
ly with current. Union Board
President Karl Goodhouse to
smooth the transition and to
learn the procedures of the
Union more fully.

“My main problem problem
right now is to find people to
work with committee heads,”
he said. ‘‘There are people out
there who want to do things
that maybe I don’t know.

“TI won’t go so far as to say
anything specific I will do
right now,” because he is still
learning about the Union.

Tyndall plans to emphasize
student participation in Union
social events, ‘‘whether that
means partying on the base-
ball field with a good band or
coming up and foot stomping

'

when we have some bluegrass
somewhere else,”’ he said.

“If anyone has any ideas,
find me,’’ said Tyndall. ‘‘I
want to keep the doors—as
well as my mind—open. This
is not a job someone can do in
a vacuum. I need all the help I
can get.”

‘I’m very, very flabber-
gasted,’’ said Ware. She has
not met with the current
Union officers yet, and so is
hesitant to mention specific
plans she has for the Co-Curri-
cular Council.

She plans to emphasize
student participation with
student/Union planning ses-
sions open to the student body
to allow students to suggest
programs. Ware also plans to
improve the coordination of
the Co-Curricular committees.

‘‘I’m pleased with the re-
sults of the elections,’’ said
Goodhouse. ‘'I think the new
officers have a basic structure
to work within that is more
applicable for the needs of the
students than we did when we

came in.”’

“They have a treméndous
opportunity to take the
groundwork that has begun
laid for them to build the
Union into the focal point of
extra-curricular activities,’”’ he
said.

“TI see the Union as moving
into a slightly different dire-
ction. Karl (Goodhouse),
Steve (Peeples) and Bob
(Mayer, current Social Chair-
man) have moved and settled
us into a new building and we
had to struggle with new
energy, new structure, and
new committees,”’ said Assist-
ant Director of the Union
William Brown.

‘I think the new people
instead of creating a structure
will work with programming,
pushing the committees,’’ he
said.

“My guess is that two old
projects will be‘pushed again:
continued effort to make the
Union a center of interest,
especially during the day
time—a drop-in place,’’ he
said.

“‘A part of the process of
making the union more of a
center of the community will
be a further liason with the
President and Social Chairmen
of the eating houses and
coordinating activities with
people in other parts of the
campus.”

fresh start.”’

About her staff, Landis
said, ‘‘All of them have had
experience with newspapers in
some form somewhere. They
are all willing to learn, that’s
the most important thing.”

One concern Landis has had
with the paper in the past has
been problems of organization
it has had. She hopes to
streamline the production of
The Davidsonian by institu-

ting a ‘‘beat system’ and by
requesting that the section
editors adhere to their stated
office hours.

‘The beat system simply
means that there will be one
reporter going to a pre-set area
each week. Irregardless of the
news that develops in these
areas, I will have someone
covering the SGA Senate, the
Union, Dr. Spencer’s office,
the Dean’s office, and others,”
said Landis.

“The editors, by keeping

regular office hours will be
able to sit in the office, receive
articles, edit articles, and re-
vise articles without having to
run all over campus. Also, as
all Davidsonian editors say,
‘All deadlines will be met’,”’
said Landis.

Landis mentioned a number
of what she called ‘‘crusades’”’ ©
that she wishes to carry out.
These include such things as
finding a new Academic Vice
President and re-structuring
campus housing.

“T have my crusades,’’ said
Landis. ‘‘First, an Academic
Vice President: I want to get
one. Another is the infirmary.
I want to look into Extended
Studies. I’m interested in
campus housing and teacher
evaluations. Also, I want to
examine the work study pro-
gram and what I call a
stagnation campus, I guess
that is a lot of crusades,”
added Landis.’

Landis’ enthusiasm for the
job is great, and she suggested
that she was looking forward
to looking with the other
students who were also elected
on Tuesday.
