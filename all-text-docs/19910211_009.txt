1966: Davidson Alumnus Reflects
On His Senior Year And Vietnam

‘By Lee McKeever

My father’s senior year at
Davidson was not a time of job
interviews or of applying to gradu-
ate school, instead he spent 1966
knowing that the minute he re-
ceived his diploma, he would be
called to serve inthe Vietnam War.
There was no alternative.

ROTC was mandatory for all
Davidson students for a period of
two years. Most students did not
elect to continue ROTC for their
junior and senior years, because
doing so meant an additional two
years of fulltime Army service and
a commitment to a six week sum-
mer program.

As our country’s commitment
to the Vietnam war grew during
the 60’s, the draft became a vehicle
of gathering qualified men for the
Army. It no longer mattered if you
were committed to the Army. be-
cause of ROTC, every eligible male

was required to serve. Even so, the.

independent draft boards had great
latitude in determining all sorts of
creative deferment status.

Doug McKeever was not medi-
cally unfit, married with children,
mentally insane, or declared a
“natural resource.”

,During his junior year, he
decided to try to obtain deferment
by attending graduate school.
Unfortunately in late 1965, the

_ government decided that this was

no longer a viable alternative to
service.

When asked why he did not
become a “conscientious objec-
tor” he responded, “I had no choice
but to actively participate in Viet-
nam. I am nota politically radical

person, and I believe that citizen-
ship does entail certain responsi-
bilities. Of course, serving in Viet-
nam was not my idea of a gradu-
ation gift, it was a fact of life.”
Where there any options? “Icould
either take my chances in the in-
fantry, or sign up for a branch of
the service that might be more at-
tractive.”
McKeever applied for an inac-
tive reserve unit in the Air Force
which provided for a six month

"This may have delayed career
decisions, but at 21 I had no idea
what I really wanted to do. I con-
sider my five yearsin the Air Force
extremely beneficial with regards
to gaining leadership and teaching
skills, being able to travel all over
the western half of the United
States, having time to learn how to
cope in a marriage, and figuring
out what I was going to do when I
grew up.”

being such that it is, his initial ap-
plication and accompanying pa-
perwork was temporarily lost.
Weeks went by with no word and

“Thad no idea what was going
on, but I did know that if I was not
accepted into Officer Training
School I was, in all likelihood,
going to be sent to Vietnam. Hav-
ing lost several friends to the war
effort, I had no desire to go and
fight for my life in a foreign coun-
try of death and terror, who did?”
Eventually, after several let-
ters to his congressman his appli-
cation was finally reviewed, he
was accepted into OTS, and sta-
tioned in Great Falls, Montana.

military field code, there was no
chance of going to Vietnam.

Many of his close friends did
go, some never came back, and
some returned with the memories
of actual combat forever sketched
in their memory.

The Gulf War seems far re-
moved from our isolated idyllic
Davidson world, but the possibil-
ity of another draft is always a
remote possibility that possibly
weighs heavily on many eligible
draftees.

So, why we are debating
whether or not we should take a
summer and leisurely “see the
world” before we start our careers
or begin graduate school, remem-
ber our fathers were most likely
trying to cope with whether or not
they were going to live.

We, too, aré lucky.

Walking canbe an all-around
good form of exercise. With mini-
mal stress on bones and joints, it
strengthens your back, legs, hips,
and lower abdomen. Pumping
your arms as you walk will also
work the arms, shoulders, sides,
back and chest.

Of course, because of speed
differences, walking burns less

‘calories per minute, and itis harder
to bring your heart rate up than
while running.

For an 150 Ib person, for ex-
ample, walking at a normal pace
will burn around 5.5 calories per
minute, while running (9m/hr)
burns 13.

However if you pick up the
pace, the differences between
walking and running as a form of
exercise are minimized,

step heel-toe, and not to make your
movements too exaggerated.

’ Just like running shoes, walk-
ing shoes need to be padded on the
bottom and have good arch sup-
ports. No Keds.

Also, remember that your feet
may swell up to a full size larger
than normal after walking for a
while, so make sure your shoes al-
low for that.

Weird fact for the week:
It’s untrue that all the alcohol

recent USDA tests, sometimes
up to 85% of the alcohol re-
