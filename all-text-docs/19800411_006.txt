Almost everyone knows that
the original Chambers building
burned down in 1921 and the
Oak and Elm Rows were among
the original campus buildings.
However, many of the college
buildings have backgrounds
that are not so well known.

For example, the building
which now houses the Center for
Special Studies was built in
1848 and served as a store and
an inn until the early 1900’s. In
the 1920’s and 30’s it was used
as a boarding house for visiting
college girls or ‘‘prom-trotters,”
as they were called, who tra-
velled from The Citadel to
Princeton, including Davidson
among their stops along the
way.

The college bought the inn in
1946 and restored it in 1971 to
its 1870’s appearance.

The President’s' home is an-
other building with an interest-
ing history. Built in 1836-37, it
too was among the first college

buildings,“ originally a simple-

two-story brick home.

Through the years it has under-
gone four major additions which
have contributed to its present
form.

College Archivist Dr. Chal-
mers Davidson has written a
book entitled The Plantation
World Around Davidson. One
of Davidson’s stories deals with
the first occupants of the house,
President Robert Hall Morrison

~and his family. Mrs. Morrison,

a planter’s daughter from a
prominent Lincoln County fam-

ily, felt that the simple two- .

story home was a step down

from what she was accustomed

to. She discouraged her daugh-
ters from marrying college pro-
fessors, urging them instead to
marry men with money. Only
one, however, heeded her advice
by marrying a businessman
from Charlotte. The others mar-
ried college professors.

Mrs. Morrison reportedly

was quite proud of her daugh-
ter’s wealth and gave it a
prominent place in conversation
when the opportunity presented
itself. The professors failed to
gain the same approval. But
when the Civil War broke out,
the ‘wealthy son-in-law became
relatively obscure while the
professors went on to gain
considerable recognition as
Confederate Generals. The most
famous of these was General
**Stonewall’”’ Jackson.

A second house was built
where Cunningham parking lot
now stands during the term of
Samuel Williamson, the second
President of the college. This
house served as the President's
house for a time and the
‘‘Morrison House’’ was the
home of various professors until
Colonel W.J. Martin II occu-
pied it again as President of the
College. Its appearance was
“substantially that of the pre-
sent” according to Dr. David-
son. It was painted gray with a
long porch across the front and
was not particularly appealing
in appearance. ;

When the Trustees eventual-
ly proposed construction of a
new house, the President at the
time, D. Grier Martin, proposed
instead to remodel the house.
Thus, in 1959 the house under-
went the changes that led to its
present appearance.

It is common knowledge that
Grey College Union was once
the library, but few students
know that Carnegie Guest

‘House was once Carnegie Li-

brary. It was remodelled as a
guest house in 1941, then
served as a temporary student
union from 1972-1975. The
building was reconverted into
its present state as a guest
house in 1976, at a cost of about
$200,000. It. has eight rooms
available for guests of the
college. The basement of Carne-
gie, formerly the student store,
now contains five rooms and a
kitchen, i housing for
upperclass women.
