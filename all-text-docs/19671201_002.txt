It looks like the Student Body may
have a constitution draft for Christ-
mas after all. ae

From all preliminary. indications,
however, it looks as though it will
bear out our earlier prediction that it
will be merely a new way to do the
same old things around here.

Members of the revision committee
have said that the reason they have not
tried to incorporate their work into
any grander concept of campus gov-
ernment is that the Student Council
resolution which created their com-
mittee only entitled them to revise the
student government, not to envision
anything larger. , ;

An interesting point to note here is
that the committee that drew up the
United States Constitution was origin-
ally told only to revise the Articles of
the Confederation. But it is probably
expecting too much of this committee
to ask that it be that creative. °

To remedy this situation, the Stu-
dent Council needs only to pass an-
other resolution suggesting to the
revision committee that they seek a
way to incorporate their work into a

larger campus framework. Plugging
the much-heralded student Senate and
Bill of Rights into such a plan would
not be a difficult task.

President D. Grier Martin promised
last spring to appoint a committee to
investigate ways in which the faculty
and student governments could be
merged to avoid the old dichotomy of
segregated campus worlds. Such a

study has not yet begun. It should have’.
been started long before the revision -

committee was ready to present its
constitution draft.

It is possible that the addition of
faculty members to the Student Coun-
cil committee which is studying the
present system of rules and punish-
ments could result in the sort of co-
operation that would lead to an inte
grated campus government.

By combining this move with a
recommendation that the constitution
revision committee try to incorporate
its work into campus government, the
Student Council could lead us away
from the dichotomy that characterizes
our present system.

Down The Drain

We are beginning to wonder just what sort of leaders are being develop-
ed by the Richardson Fellows program here. _ ;

If they are supposed to follow the leadership example being set by the
people who run the program then they will turn out to be extremely inef-

fective leaders.

Just look at what the program is supposed to be doing. If anyone can
find out, please tell the administrators of the Fellowship. They certainly do

not seem to know.

In three months of activity during this school year, the students involved
in the program have met less than six times. The future plans that are sup-
posed to salvage the program are only the same oid things that were being

planned last spring.

The Richardson Foundation has dumped $20,000 into the local program,
supposedly with the idea of getting some sort of results. It looks like the
only thing they have received thus far is an attractive office in the College

Union and some very expensive Drano.

A New Philosophy

By undertaking a major study of the
rules and punishments that govern
student life, the Student Council
should take a positive step towards
developing a more realistic philosophy
of student discipline.

All too often complaints about the
present rule structure have only dealt
with the dippy manifestations of the
basic hypocrisy and unreality of the
in loco parentis doctrine.

Davidson is certainly not fulfilling
its goal of creating a whole man if it
only liberates the academic aspects
of a student's personality. The college
has begun to accept the idea that the
student’s mind matures more under
an academic program which allows
more freedom to him.

It needs to apply this same philoso-
phy to the nurturing of the student's
whole outlook on life. To simply re-
place parental rules with college rules.
when the student enters Davidson does.
not help him develop self-reliance.

The whole idea of student self-
government is really little more than
a sham when it operates under the
old in loco parentis concept. The col-
lege has accepted the practical results
of student self-government, but it has
not come to realize the implications
that these results hold for the rela-
tionship between students and the-col-

ge.

The college position on consump-
tion of alcoholic beverages on campus
is the most obvious example of the
use of in loco parentis here. Students
were supposedly self-governing on the
“ matter. But when they decided that
the rule was no longer of use, their

repeal of the rule had no effect on

the college's policy.
One of the main reasons it had no

effect was the fact that the college
believed that under the in loco par-
entis doctrine it was carrying out a
parental role in refusing to accept the
change in the student rule. Regardless
of the college’s position on the effects

of alcohol, it should not dictate its

ideas to the student by the use of
rules.

To gripe about the dry campus,
about closed dorms, etc. is only to
slap at shadows. The real substance
of the present system of student dis-
cipline is the out-dated concept of in
loco parentis, a concept that stands
in opposition to the whole ideal of
the liberal arts education designed to
nurture the maturation of the whole
student.

Getting Results

Fortunately for the freshman class,
it looks as though the Freshmen Coun-
cil is becoming something more than
just a way to help former high school
BMOC’s adjust to political competition
from other qualified high school
BMOC's.

While more telephones and vend-
ing machines for the freshmen dorms
will hardly revolutionize the campus,
they do represent something revolu-
tionary for the Freshman Council,
tangible results instead of the normal
empty politickin’.

If Freshman Council President Steve
Engstrom and his group can continue
their good work and make something
out of Lingle Manor as the Student
Council has requested they do, they
may even replace that old campus joke
with a worthwhile addition to student

ife.

Not Just For Dates

What is that old line about the roar
of the greasepaint and the smell of
the crowd?

Somewhere out of the confusion and
impracticality that is supposed to char-
acterize the theater, the Red and Black
Masquers have come up with an ex-
ample that the rest of the college
would do well to follow.

In sponsoring the presentation Wed-
nesday night of ‘‘A Raisin in the Sun”
by students from Charlotte's Johnson
C. Smith University, the local drama
club demonstrated the benefits of co-
operation by Davidson. with another
area college.

The Piedmont University Center,
now headed by former Davidson pro-
fessor Dr. Paul A. Marrotte, is another
example of the ways in which such
cooperation can aid the college pro-
gram.

Cooperation in other fields seems
to be limited to having Queens Col-
lege girls participate in a program just
to attract a larger crowd of Davidson
students.

Although a pooling of resources to
hold top-flight symposia is one of the
most obvious ways that the colleges in
the Charlotte area could cooperate, it
is not the only way. Any type of pro-
gram bringing together students and
faculty members from these schools
would be a broadening experience.

Davidson gentlemen are often ac-
cused of intellectual and social snob-
bery by students at other schools.
Perhaps one reason for this accusation
is that Davidson seems to forget: that
other schools do not exist in this area
simply to give its students places to
find dates,

Critics Taking Bead
On Conscript Law

By WALTER GRANT
Collegiate Press Service
Although Congress has ex-

tended the draft for four
more years, the Selective
Service System still may be
come a campaign issue in
next year's presidential elec-
tion. °

It is highly doubtful that
either the Democratic or Re-
publican candidate will
pledge to abolish the draft at
this time. But it appears
likely that one or both par-
ties will propose a number
of reforms in the military
system which, among other
things, may be aimed at re-
ducing draft calls to zero.

Such reforms would be de-
signed to encourage more
young people to volunteer for
the army by making military
service appear more attrac-
tive. The most important re-
form would be to raise the
military pay scale:so that it
begins at the minimum wage
level of civilian rates.

Chances that increased pay
for soldiers will be a cam-
paign issue were boosted last
week when a Gallup poll
showed that eight out of ten
persons favor such a plan.
When an issue has such wide-
spread voter appeal, presi
dential candidates are not
likely to ignore it.

The proposal also is b:-
coming more popular in
Congress. Twenty-two Repub-
ltcan House members recent-
ly issued a joint statement
advocating certain military
reforms, including an_ in-
creased pay scale, as a way
of reducing draft} calls and
putting the armed forces on
a volunteer basis.

The House already has tak
en the initial: step by passing
a 5.6 per cent increase in
basic pay for the nation’s 3.5

million military servicemen.
The bill, which would cost
about $633 million in the first
year, is expected to receive
positive action in the Senate.

The big question is whether
or not more young people will
volunteer for the military if
Congress and the Pentagon
increase the benefits for mili-
tary personnel. Most ob-
servers agree that military
reforms will result in an in-
creased number of volun-
teers, but there is disagree-
ment over whether there
would be enough new volun-
teers to end draft calls.

At least five Congressmen
think an all-volunteer army
is indeed possible if the right
improvements are made.
Their ideas appear in a book
entitled, “‘How to End The
Draft.’ which was published
this month.

The Congressmen list 31
specific recommendations in
what they say is ‘‘the first
effort to define systematic-
ally a specific program of
action which can lead to an
all-volunteer service and the
elimination of draft calls."
They believe that if their
recommendations are follow-
ed, an all-volunteer service is
possible within two to five
years. The estimated total
maximum cost is $3.96 billion
a year,

Authors of the book are Re-
publicans Robert T. Stafford,
Frank J. Horton, Richard S.
Schweiker, Garner E. Shriv-
er, and Charles W. Whalen,
Jr. They emphasize they are
not advocating that the Se-
lective Service System be
abolished, but are merely
recommending reforms which
“individually and collectively
can.work fo reduce the size
of draft calls, hopefully down
to zero,” even under present

circumstances.

But, says Douglas F. Bai-
ley, research director for the
five Congressmen. “if esca-
lation of the war continued,
resulting in the need for
more servicemen, there
would still have to be some
draft. I don't think we could
get that many to volunteer.
But I think this plan will be
effective in ending the draft
under the present situation
and particularly under real
peace-time circumstances.”

The major proposal need-
ing legislative action involves
military pay increases. ‘‘As
long as beginning servicemen
get paid less than the mini-
mum wage required by law,
there is no hope of ever get-
ting rid of the draft," Rep.
Stafford says. ‘‘If military
pay scales are not made
commensurate with civilian
pay scales, many young men
who may wish to serve may
not do so for they cannot af-
ford to make the financial
sacrifice.’'

One problem, Bailey feels,
Is that President Johnson wilt
not want to endorse the pro-
posals since they are being
pushed by Republicans. But
he thinks Johnson will push
for them anyway if and when
he feels it will be to his po-
litical advantage. And Bailey
thinks that all the potential
Republican candidates for
president will endorse the
proposals and strive for an
all-volunteer service.

The proposals of the Re-
publican Congress could pro-
vide the basis for a major
issue in the GOP platform.
And if polls continue to indi-
cate the overwhelming ma-
jority of the voters favor the
plan, President Johnson and
the Democrats may be forced
to respond in some way.

‘CONFESSIONS?_PRAISED

Styron Finally Realizes Potential

‘The Confessions of Nat
Turner’ by William Styron.
New York: Random House,
tnc., 1967. xvi, 428pp. $6.95.

In the 24 years which have
passed since he left Davidson
College. William Styron has
written four books: ‘“‘Lie
Down in Darkness’ (1951).
“The Long March” (1953).
“Set This House on Fire’
(1960). and “The Confessions
of Nat Turner’ (1967).

In his latest novel Styron
has for the first time fully
realized the powerful talent
that fitfully appeared in his
earlier fictions, especially in
**Lie Down in Darkness,"* one
of the few major novels to
come out of the South since
the Second World War..

With this book Styron has
established himself as the
only major prose fictionist in
the South .who began: writing
after the war, excepting Flan-
nery O'Connor, *‘The Confes-
sions of Nat Turner'’ not only
shows that. its author has at
last found his true voice and
idiom, but it also demon-
strates that fiction of the
highest order can still be
written in the South.

Contrary to what Styron

tells us, “‘Nat Turner” is a
historical novel as well as a
**meditation on history.’’ The
action is laid in Tidewater
Virginia in the early nine-
teenth century, as the culture
and society of this region are
undergoing radical change.

The emergence of a his-
torical character like Nat
Turner, however shadowy in
actual fact, Styron takes as
representative of that change,
if not characteristic of it.
And so the book is logically
Nat's story: it is principally
about his experience, and he
tells it.

Styron‘s most difficult prob-
lem is the realistic depiction
of the Negro mind, the mind
of an uncommonly sensitive
and intelligent man who in
many ways does not outgrow
his primitiveness and naivete.

In order to accomplish
this, the author mist use and
modify certain recognized
conventions, and therefore he
creates Nat with articulation
which is greater than he
probably possessed in fact—
and Nat’s language is essen-
tially Styron’s.

These things are necessary
for the author to fully render
Nat’s experience—and pres-

ent the novel from the first
person point of view with
Nat as teller. Nat unfolds his
story through a series of
flashbacks, and Styron man-
ages the presentation of ante.
cedent action with great skill.

As a whole the narrative is
béautifully paced, with a fine
balance between panoramic
summary and _ dramatic
scene,

Sloth On Blessings

Owing to the fact that I suddenly discovered that
certain of my courses, even in this, my senior year,
require some reading, I spent the Thanksgiving break
here on campus. . .

My major problem while staying at Davidson was
keeping awake. Although this problem is certainly not
new, it was compounded during Thanksgiving by the
lack of noise and other distracting activity. Thus, I was
compelled to devise a scheme by which to avoid the

eat bag monster. It suddenly occurred to me that |
could look to techniques for inducing sleep in order to
discover a technique for preventing the arrival of the
great god Sloth. .

One common means for bringing on slumber is to
count sheep as they leap over an imaginary fence. Now,
I thought to myself, what can I enumerate that will
keep me awake? The spirit of Thanksgiving at once
engulfed me, and I was inspired by this apprehension
of the numinous. Why not count my blessings? Or, even
better. why not count the blessings of mankind?

The first blessing that came to mind was the bless-
ing of world-wide poverty and starvation. Without such |
deprivation, mankind would be denied the opportunity
‘to experience life to its fullest, to appreciate truly the
presence of food. ;

But starvation is not the only blessing which pres-
ently characterizes the human condition. We also have
been given the opportunity to. participate in nuclear
war. At first glance, this might be considered a curse,
but the threat of world destruction is actually an ex-
‘ample of the proverbial blessing in disguise. For, the
threat of nuclear holocaust has given us peace by
deterrent, a tribute to the wisdom and moderation of
world leaders. Evidence that this policy is working can
be seen in Vietnam, where we are engaged not in a
declared war but in a progra acification. The
cause of casualty lists of course remains a mystery.

There are yet other blessings for which mankind
can be thankful in this holdiay season. The economic
crisis in Britain, for example, has given the world
community the chance to hear Charles DeGaulle’s
meaningful insights concerning the glory of France
and the moral bankruptcy of Canada.

One does not have to look outside the United
States, however, to find blessing for which to be
thankful. The mature, sophisticated manner in which
the people of Gary, Ind., responded to the candi.
dacy of a Negro for the mayor of that city has given
us new hope for the solution of America’s racial |
crisis.

The candidacy of George Wallace for the Ameri-
can presidency has provided us with one more chance
to return to the glorious heritage under which this
nation has long endured—the heritage of white su-
premacy and individual rights. And the political situa-
tion is made even brighter by the aspirations of Holly-
wood figures to high political office.

Up to this point, the blessings I saw flashing before
my mind's eye were helpful in keeping me awake.
However, I still was not completely satisfied with this
technique, inasmuch as world starvation, racial strife,
and the threat of nuclear war are all God's fault. I
wanted to count something for which I personally
might be responsible.

The first thing that came to my mind were the
facts that I am not starving, that I do not suffer from
napalm burns, and that I have not been caught in a
race riot, either whité or black. Aware that my situation
is due to my fantastic drive for work and progress in
our free enterprise system, to my citizenship in a
peace loving democracy, and to my enlightened, liberal
views on race relations (some of my best Negroes are
friends), I found these thoughts much more satisfying
to contemplate than the blessings of mankind as a
whole. But here my whole scheme for keeping awake
began to break down. For some reason, blessings like .
the threat of world destruction tended to keep me
awake. But at the same time, my personal accomplish-
ments seemed somehow to bring on the rack muse. My
eyelids grew heavy as I gloried in that good old feeling
of self-satisfaction.

ary will ts blunted by his
feelings of gullt.

The violence in ‘“‘The Con-
fessions of Nat Turner’ is
(to quote an anonymous Eng: |
lish critic) ‘not merely the
violence of man; it is that of-
nature, of the ‘general chaos
of the world,’ of the inelucta-
ble order of things, of the
whole creation.”

Since it is this kind of
violence, it strikes the read-
er as part of the true scheme
of things—as believable and
necessary. And this element
is a key part of the realism
and credibility of Styron’s

to discover the meaning of
his protagonist's experience.
Form and content are accord-
ingly joined.

In the end one finds that
Nat's obsessions inevitably
led to the massacre which
he plans and carries out.

The overriding passion in.

volves Nat's race and the
condition of his servitude:
the others are his Old Testa-

ment religiousness and Puri.

tanical zeal as a minister,
his sexual repression, and his
fascination with violence.
Ironically in the end Nat
is defeated by his very hu-
manity, when his revotution-

novel.

“The Confessions of Nat
Turner" is saturated with the
feeling of actuality: in it
Styron has a sure grasp of
the concrete and the imagin-
ed whole: this involves a
sense of place as a dramatic
dimension of the action: a
sense of the interplay of past
and present, and the. way a
dramatic moment (the com-
ing execution) can bind them
together: and, finally, a tra-
gic sense of life with its in-
escapable waste, violence,
corruption, and evil.
