LITERARY NEWS

PHI LITERARY SOCIETY
STARTS YEAR’S WORK EARLY.

The Philanthropic Literary Society
held its first regular meeting last Sat-
urday night after the movies. Follow-
ing the opening exercises the president
- announced that the purpose of this meet-
ing was to give all members the opportu-
nity of suggesting plans for the work of
the new year. He then threw the ses-
sion open for such discussion.

Several men offered exceedingly help-
ful suggestions. One of the best was
that each member should do his best to
make the work of the Philanthropic
Society attractive as possible. Another
Was that each man should make it a
point to keep himself informed in ad-
vance concerning the program,

In the near future a committee from)
each of the Literary Societies under the}
leadership of J. H. McKeithen will ap-|
“proach the new men on the matter of}
society membership.

MANY IMPROVEMENTS MADE
ON HILL DURING VACATION

Mahy improvements have been made
in and around the campus since our de-
parture last spring. Last year those
who roomed in the barracks made a
solemn promise that they would never
again make their abode there. How-
ever, the barracks have been entirely
changed jn appearance as well as in’
comfort. The beaver-board walls -have
been replaced by plastered walls and
plastered ceilings. Steam heat has been
installed replacing the stoves. The two
buildings have been painted and the én-
tire remodeling gives a ‘clean, pleasing
effect.

Professor Erwin’s old home has been
changed and remodeled somewhat and

ACTIVITIES

There is no question so intangible or|
vital that it cannot be successfully solv-|
cd by the application of common sense. |

The use of common sense is the begin- |
ning of wisdom and when common sense!
is overridden by undue agitation it leads
to quick conclusions that close the mind
to reason,

Without reason we cannot be reason-
able and if we cannot be reasonable we
cannot be fair to ourselves or to others.

Peace and plenty. rest upon the great
pillar of common sense and this pillar
is set in the solid cement foundation of
harmony and unified effort—not in the
quicksand of dissension and unrest.

ENDEAVOR EXTENSION PLAN
D

In addition to the regular Christian
Endéavor services held in the local
church every Sunday afternoon the Y.
M. C. A. is going to promote Christian
Endeavor by extending its field of ac-
tivity to promote C. E, work in the sur-
rounding neighborhood. The plan is to
established a Christian Endeavor Society
at the points where the students teach
Sunday School. First there will be a
speaker representing the Christian En-
deavor that will visit each point and
give a general outline of what the Chris-
tian Endeavor means, what it stands for,
and what great things it has accom-
plished in the last five years. This will
be followed by a “Flying Squadron,”
who will organize a society and get it
on a running basis. Then there will be
one or two C. E. supervisors attached to
each Sunday School teaching team who
will carry the work on during the rest
of the year. At present ‘this activity
will be confined to the Sunday Schools,
where the students teach, but doubtless
later it will be extended to include a
great deal more territory.

Y. M. C. A. HOLDS INITIAL
MEETING OF NEW YEAR

With practically every seat occupied,
the Y. M.-C. A. last Sunday held its first
Sunday vesper service.

Dwight Chalmers delivered an excep-
tionally forceful address on the funda-
mentals of the “Y,” bringing out the
point that the “Y” is founded upon belief
in Jesus Christ. The service was mark-
ed by an unusually fine musical program,
Okey Allison leading the singing in fine
style. |His summer’s work as a song
leader enabling him to be additionally
helpful.

T. M. Lowry, in charge of Bible Study
on the “Y" cabinet, made the important
announcement that the Bible study
classes will be held every Wednesday
night at 9 o'clock, the course this year
being taken from Acts, After a violin
solo by Graves the service was turned
over to Dwight Chalmers.

Dwightt took as his text Matt. 18:3 and
spoke upon belief in Jesus Christ. Until
we cease excusing ourselves for our
sins and see-how Jesus would-have-us
he, we cannot realize these sins. First
we must realize them and then believe
on Jesus, which is the basic principle of
the Y. M. C. A. If we believe, then let
us remember “that all things work to-
gether for good to them that love God,”
and let the rest go by.

ure of hearing at the “Y” service Sun-

whom he had more influence than any-
one else. Due to his wonderful person-
ality he was brought back to Blue Ridge

ference.
