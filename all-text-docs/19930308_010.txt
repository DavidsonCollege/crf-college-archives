‘Cats Edge Marshall, Fall to UTC in Tournament Semis
Men’s Basketball Team Holds First Seeded Moccasins Until Last Moment

By Bruce Balestier

During aroughly eight minute
span late in the second half of
Davidson’s Southern Conference
Tournament semifinal game with
UT-Chattanooga Saturday, as the
Wildcats all but erased a 16-point
deficit, they began to seem like a
team of destiny. The comeback
began atthe 8:52 mark, when Janko
Narat hit a three-pointer to make it
55-42. Jason Zimmerman’s three-
pointer with 5:17 left made it 59-
52. Narat cut it to 68-63 with a

The men’s track and field team
wound up its indoor campaign with
several solid efforts at the South-

ern Conference Championships at

VMI. Although Davidson could
not improve on last year’s seven-
point performance, the squad feels
confident entering the outdoorsea-
son.

The most impressive effort of

the weekend came from senior *

David Kerns, whose strong mile
run of 4:29.4 ranks him fourth ever
at Davidson.

Tan Stewart ran a gutsy 9:02.1
in the 3000m run on Friday night.
Stewart came back on Saturday to
run a 5000m of 15:40.2 to become
Davidson’s third fastest ever.

Duncan Spears’ solid effort in
the 400m was marred by a contro-
versial wipe-out in the first turn.
Spears was slowed by the mishap,
but no disqualification followed
and Spears failed to make the final
with his 53.1 clocking.

Peter Hurtado also failed in
his effort to make the finals in the
800m run, although his 2:00.8 was
the fourth fastest ever by a
Davidson athlete.

Lee Sutton fell short of break-
ing the school record he currently
holds in the shot es with a put of
44' 8".

Erik McMichael led the way
for the Wildcats in the 4x800m
relay with a strong 2:00.1 split.
The squad of Spears, McMichael,
Kerns, and Hurtado finished sev-
enth,

Also finishing seventh was the
men’s 4x400m squad of Spears,
Hurtado, Joe Beach, and Mike
Grant.

Coach Andrew feels his team
is poised for an outstanding out-
door season after the many near-
records the squad posted this win-
ter. The outdoor season begins in
two weeks at UNC-Wilmington.

Hampered by injury and sick-
ness, the women’s track and field
team managed several fine perfor-
mances at the Southern Confer-
ence Championships at VMI. With

The Moccasins called timeout
at :49, then naturally looked ‘to
point guard Tim Brooks, their lead-
ing scorer and the conference
player of the year. His teammates
cleared out and Brooks went one
on one, guarded by freshman Jeff
Anderson. Brooks drove to theright
baseline and threw up an awkward
shot with 19 seconds left, but
Anderson was called for the foul

on a controversial .call. Brooks,
who finished with 23 points and
made all the big plays down the
stretch, made both free throws to
give the Mocs a 70-66 lead.
Chris Alpert, attempting to
find Zimmerman, threw the ball
out of bounds on the ensuing pos-
session. After UTC’s Gary Robb
made one free throw, Brandon
Williams’ tip-in at :04 made it 71-
68. But the Mocs’ Chad Copeland
made the second of two foul shots
with :03 left to clinch the 72-68

IMAC Participants
Engage in Playoffs

By Robert Lloyd-Still
As the college basketball sea-
son winds down and teams prepare

for the NCAA tournament,

Davidson students have been par-
ticipating in a tournament of their
own. During the tournament, over
thirty teams will battle for three
elusive championships: A-League,
B-League, and Women’s League.

The All-Stars, led by Mike

‘Freeman and Chuck Brooks, will

attempt to defend their A-League

championship. The All Stars, con-_.

sisting of players from the BSC,
had an extraordinary season. A
repeat, however, will be awfully
difficult. The All- Stars will face
tough competition from Kappa
Alphaand Kappa Sigma, both hav-
ing former Davidson basketball

_ Players on their teams.

While the A-League show-

cases the best basketball that —

Davidson intramurals has to offer,
over twenty five teams will vie for

‘inside-outside combo of.

the B-League Rms B-
League participants deemphasize
the winning aspect; and most par-
ticipate because they enjoy the
comraderie and exercise. Thereare
four undefeated teams in B-League,
and all have legitimate chances at
winning. The early favorite would

‘have to be Getting Stupid, which

has looked tough all year with the

darkhorse, however, is Lloyd’s
Team which has come on strongly
of late.

In the women’s ice The
Fab.Seniors would have to be the
favorites, because they went unde-
feated in the regular season. They
are led by twin towers, Carla Davis
and Jenny Wagner, who make up
the bulk of their scoring. They will
face some stiff competition, how-
ever, from the Old Women who

Freshman Hooff Helps

Swimming Program

By Jimmy Jackson

With season’s end approach-
ing, Davidson was looking for a
strong performance in last
weekend’s Southern States Swim-
ming and Diving Championships
at Davidson.

Since the competition in-
cluded mainstays such. as Louis-
ville, Wash-

Charleston,
Davidson |
needed fj
strong indi- ©
vidual per-
formances to
inspire a
strong week-
end performance. Thatimpetus was
provided by newcomer Churchill
Hooff.

Hooff (pronounced Huff”), a
freshman, had proven through his
season performances that he was
capable of becoming, according to
coach Ron Morrow, “one of the
finest swimmers Davidson has
known,”

In fact, Hooff won around
eighty percent of the events he
swam, most commonly in the dual
events, the 500 and 1000 freestyle.
He seldom wins, however, in his
favorite event, the 200 yard
freestyle.

“We have a lot of good young
swimmers who like the 200, so I
-usually didn’t swim it. The longer
events suit-my swimming style
better,” Hooff said.

The Southern States was the
peak of this year’s swimming and
diving season. Hooff added, “We
had primed ourselves for it. The
dual meets were not that big. We
were always thinking of the Sonth-
em States first.”

Friday’s trials brought Hooff
into position to attain the goals he
set for himself at the season’s com-
mencement: three medals in this
tournament.

Hooff’s quest began on Fri-
day with good qualifying times in
‘each of his events. He continued
this ascendance with a victory in
the 500 freestyle.

In an exciting 500 freestyle
final, the swimmer ahead of Hooff
had a body length lead 200 yards

Hooff

into the race.

Hooff employed his back-
ground of distance work to. over-
take his adversary in the last hun-
dred yards. Hooff remembers, “I
was dead and I thoughthe was, too.
I managed to slip by him.” When

all was finished, Hooff had set the

Southern States record with
4:40.19.

Though the 500 is Churchill’s
strongest event, he came on strong
in the 1650 freestyle as well. In a
tight race with two other swim-
mers, Hooff managed second place

~ while breaking. the previdgs pool
‘record: °° >'*'

Later Hooff also teamed with
Dan Ream, Dan Bahmiller, and
Corey Bean foran impressive sixth
place finish in the 4x50 freestyle.

Perhaps the most impressive
feat of Hooff’s weekend came in
the 200 freestyle on Saturday. Af-
ter qualifying a dismal seventh in
the preliminary races, he overcame
bad initial performance with an
exciting second place finish.

With this rousing final, Hooff —
had added his third medal .to his
growing stockpile. His time of
1:43.39 was also his third personal
best of the weekend.

“Hooff’s impressive weekend

. isonly a glimpse of whatis tocome

for Davidson swimming. With our
second recruiting class coming next
year, we have a lot to look forward
to,” said Coach Morrow. ‘
Hooff added, “Athletics at
Davidson really seem to be on the
rise. Based on how the soccer team
did and the impressive basketball
performances by freshmen, we
have an exciting future, I hope that
Carries Over to swimming and div-
ing as well. Our team feels this is a
good start.” ;
Based on the leaps made by’
Hooff, strong performances by
other freshmen such as Boler,
Corey Beam and a host of other
talented swimmers, the future of
Davidson aquatics seems to be one
of the brightestin Davidson sports.
“T still have a lot of improve-
ment to go,” said Hooff. With that
attitude, another recruiting class,

- and successes such as Chuchill

Hooff had last weekend, we can

“expect big things from Davidson

swimming and diving in the fu-
ture. ;
