CAROLINA PLANS FOUR-MILE
CROSS-COUNTRY RUN

The University of North Carolina has
practically completed arrangements for a
four-mile cross-country run to be held
near Chapel Hill. “They have asked all
of the colleges of the state to take part
in this event. Already A. & M. and
Trinity have notified Manager Hackler
of their willingness to participate. Ac-
cording to the agreement each college
can enter as many contestants as it de-
sires. The decision will be based on the
four finishing best for cach college.

W. G. Morrison, captain of David-
son’s track team, received a letter from
the Carolina manager requesting David-
son to enter, but as yet it has not been
decided by the executive committee of
the Athletic Association whether David-
son will be represented. The student
body is very desirous of sending their
four men and it is hoped that the an-
swer to Carolina will be favorable.

Wake Forest is considering the mat-
ter, and it is tikely they will enter. The
event is cheduled for November 20.

CLUBS ORGANIZED.

MEDICAL CLUB.

At a meeting held in the chapel last
Tuesday night, the Davidson Medical
Club was formally organized, and the
following officers elected: President,
W. A. Dumas (by acclamation) ; vice-
president, Wm. Hollister} ’ secretary-
treasurer, D. V. Hudson. About forty
men were present at the meeting, enthus-
iastically endorsing the movement.
Committees were appointed on name
and constitution, and it is hoped that
permanent organization may be effected
within a few weeks.

A good proportion of the Davidson
students, usually about 15 per cent an-
nually, are in preparation for the study
of medicine; and through uniting them-
selves into a club of this type, these men
hope to gain a better knowledge of the
preparation needed for that study, of the
entrance requirements of the. various
schools, and in addition, to secure speak-
ers on subjects allied to medicine, when-
ever possible. All men who are expect-
ing to make medicine a life work are
urged to join the club.

Tt was planned to have Dr. R. H.
Crawford, a 1910 Davidson graduate,
who after obtaining his M.D. degree at
Johns Hopkins University, spent a year
in the German field hospitals, and who
has just returned, to speak to the student
body this week, if possible. A committec
was appointed to arrange the details.

GEORGIA CLUR.

The Georgia Club held its initial
meeting of the session last Wednesday
morning after chapel, and plans were
discussed for the year. The Empire
State sent twenty-eight of her sons to
Davidson this fall, and prospects are
good for an enthusiastic club.

It was suggested that J. G. Patton,
Jr., be re-elected as president for 1915-
16, but he declared against the second
term policy, and W. A. Dumas was
elected to succeed him. A social meet-
ing with its accompanving “feed” will be
held carly in November, and the other
officers will be elected at that time.
