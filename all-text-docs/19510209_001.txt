War Casualty Revived Here;
Dramatic Fraternity Meets

Eight Davidson students were
honored this past week by initia-
tion into the Iota Kappa chapter of
Alpha Psi Omega, national drama.
tics fraternity which was recently
reactivated on the campus through
the efforts of Professor Raymond
W. Tyson of the Speech Depart-
ment. ‘

As is. probably not generally
known, this organization had a
chapter located at Davidson before
the war, but, along with so many
other organizations and institutions,
“folded up” as a result of the havoc
caused on this and other campuses,
brought about. by the war. Profes-
sor Tyson, himself a member of
Alpha Psi Omega, recently carried
on correspondence with the nation-
al headquarters of the fraternity,
and as a result this organization
takes its place among the other
honorary fraternities located on the
campus.

There are three prominent na-
tional societies of this type: Theta
Alpha Phi, Alpha Psi Omega, and
the “National Collegiate Players.”
Recent years, however, have scen

ing as the leader of national college
dramatic societies, with some 250
local chapters, some of which are

Army Will Give
Gold Bars To 5

Five members of the Senior Class
have been notified by the Depart.
ment of the army that they have
been selected for commissions as
second lieutenants in the Regular
Army, effective June 15. Ali five
have indicated their intention, at
this time, accepting the commis-
sions. Four of the five are to be
commissioned in the infantry, while
one is to be commissioned in the
artillery. Infantry commissions go
to: Fred Best, Lee Burch, John
Loftin, J. Ci, Roberts. Artillery com-
mission goes to Woody Leach.

These students are Distinguished
Military Students who, because of
that fact, were eligible last fall to
compete for regular army commis.
sions. The five students were the
only applicants from Davidson. The
PMS & T has stated that it is un.
derstood that more than twice as
many applications were submitted
as there were appointments. through-
out the Country.

Is Instrumental
In Reactivation

U.S.C., Clemson, William and
Mary, and also, parallel to the
Davidson chapter, a recently re-
activated chapter at Rutgers Uni.
versity.

When asked the purpose of his
reactivating the chapter here, Prof.
Tyson said that he felt that such
an organization would “give added
incentive for work in dramatics.”
He stressed emphatically that the
fraternity “is not a substitute for
the Red and Black. Masquers,” an
organization long an integral part
of the college, but that it is simply
“an added reward for outstanding
work done in the field of dramat-
ics.”

Eligibility for membership in Al-
pha Psi Omega is determined by a
point system, the minimum number
of points set by the national frater-
nity with each chapter privileged
to raise that minimum if they so
desire. This minimum normally con-
sists of two major roles and four
minor roles in major productions.
In addition, the candidate for mem.
bership must display the attributes
of willingness, cooperation, a love
for and interest in dramatics, and
a sincere desire to further the cause
of dramatics especially in the school
where the individual’s chapter is
located. Satisfactory scholastic a-
chievement is an important factor,
and, on the Davidson campus,
membership in the Red and Black
Masquers precedes membership in
Alpha Psi Omega.

The actual reactivation was be.

gun Thursday when eight David-
son men, all of whom have an
admirable record in. dramatics and
who have chalked up enough points
to be eligible for memberhip, were
given the formal initiation rites by

McKay, Bob Gay,. Bob Hollister,

chapter, are fratres in facultate.
In commenting on the recent re-
installation of the chapter here,
Professor Tyson said: “I sincerely
hope that Alpha Psi Omega will

the Davidson campus, and make
dramatic art a more vital cultural

Drinking Contest ?

. .. Well, not exactly. But
you do have a chance to win
$200 in a collegiate essay con-
test on “Drinking: Personal or
Social Responsibility?” Essay
length: 500 to 800 words, so for
first prize the rate of pay is
25e or more per word. .

This contest, sponsored by
the Intercollegiate Association,
is an attempt to strike at the
roots of many of today's prob-
lems. The prizes (15 altogether
totalling $1,700) are awarded
not for the words themselves,
but the study and thought in-
vested to produce the short

tery of past customs of man a small well-ordered plot discreetly walled
off in an inconspicuous corner. In this guarded nook the grass grows
thick and ivy twines luxuriantly about the brick walls and most of the
monuments. Here death goes on completely undisturbed except for
occasional wrinkled and bespectacled old men, who merely come in,
gaze meditatively at one of the markers for a few moments, perhaps
chuckle softly to themselves, and then quietly go. Such is the fate of
the souls resting here, for in this unfréquented enclosure lies the souls of
departed collegiate traditions.

There are in this place a few large monuments bearing such words
as: “Here lies the last remains of real undergraduate scholarship,” and
“Beneath this pile of granite rests amateur collegiate athletics.” Such
as these however, are crumbling with age and the ivy must be brushed
aside to read the inscriptions thereupon. In fact only one stone out of
all the company proclaims its youth in its snowy whiteness. Upon this
otherwise modest marble is engraved a profound, but complicated ecpi-
taph in Greek. Literally translated it reads as follows:

“Beneath this stone there lies one whose life was noble and well-
used. By this traditian many were the neophytes who received their
testing; then went on to become noble among the Greeks. Many were
the late and early hours. Great was the spoil and mysterious its origin.
Great were the adventures and greater still the stories of them. Many
were the wise and and witty Greeks who conceived additions to keep
the tradition alive and thriving. Indeed life was ended in its prime.
Great was the mourning thereupon.

“Here lies Quests of Pledges whose life was treacherously snuffed
out by the crude Practicality and stiff Reputation. Date of birth—
antiquity. Date of death—1951.”

‘Tis said the grief and resentment over this latest death and murder
were immediate, loud, and resentful. There were gatherings where
voices and clinched fists were raised. Oaths were sworn and threats
were poured forth into the empty air. There were rumors of rebellion
and revenge. But Practicality and Reputation, the authors of the deed,
which indelibly stained their countenances (though ’tis said they were
not alone), won out again, and the storm subsided. New traditions
would rise. Their seeds were already planted. Soon they would sprout
and blossom into maturity. But then, beside the new white marker and
the freshly spaded mound there lies in the shadows an empty space.
Do the shadows fall from the grave digger and his shovel?

Negro Youth Caught
Robbing Watts Dorm

A 17-year-old Negro was arrest-
ed a second time in two months for
breaking into and stealing from
college dormitorics Monday morn-
ing, February 5. The youth was

Freddy Johnson of Davidson.

Early last Monday morning, Cop
Linker was making his regular 3:15
inspection tour of the dormitories
whon he noticed a student franti.
cally knotking on the shop door
where Cop's office is located. He
shouted to the boy, asking him if
there was any trouble. Everett
Brown, the boy, told Cop that there
was a Negro robbing rooms in
Watts dormitory.

Telling Brown to cover the rear
door, Cop stationed himself in a
position to watch the front. Soon
after, a face appeared for an in.
stant under the light which illumin-
ates the front door and’ immediately
fled down the hall. Cop recognized

the countenance of Freddy John-}-

son, who had broken into Georgia
Dorm a_ scant sixty days ago.
Brown was caught off-guard as the
Negro bowled past him and out
into the night. Cop, chasing him,
fired three shots at the fleeing fig-
ure, He then put in a quick call
to Ptl. Joe Wally, Davidson’s po-
liceman, and ordered him to patrol
Main Street in search of Johnson.
- After calling Wally, Cop, Brown
and Buddy Kendrick, who had
joined them, returned to Brown's
room to ascertain any loss suffered.
Brown's wallet was found to be
missing.

The two boys live in 412 Watts,
the last room at the end of the hall
facing the stud. Cop noticed that
the door of 312 was cracked indi.
cating Johnson may have been in
several rooms before he awakened
Brown. In fumbling for wallets or
other valuables, Johnson. had
scraped a dime onto the floor
which aroused Brown.

Officer Wally called back to re-
port he had not seen Johnson, so
all four piled into a college truck
and sped to the miscreant’s home.
He and his mother, with whom he
shares his home, were there. He

Dr. James S. Purcell

Guest of Conference

On January 29, 30, and 31, Dr.
James S. Purcell, associate profes-
sor of English, was the guest of
Emory University at the Confer.
ence on the Common Tasks of the
Social Sciences and Humanities.
This exploratory gathering of sixty
Southern educators interested in
the social sciences and the humani-.
ties sought to determine the pur-
poses which the two divisions have
in common and the points at which
they might strengthen each other
in the achievement, as well as to
decide upon ways in which these
combined aims and points of view
should affect teaching, educational
planning, and research.

Dy. Purcell worked with the
group concerned with the role of
arts and letters in culture. Other
groups examined the nature of
man, the role of religion in culture,
and the prospects of an emerging
world culture.

Year's Alumni Gifts
Surpass 1949 Mark

With an increase over 1949 of
116 percent, Alumni and friends of
Davidson college last year contri-
buted $50,586.97 for general opera.
ting expenses of the college, scho-
larship aid for needy students and
other causes,

Overshooting the 1950 goal of
$50,000, the Alumni Fund almost
doubled any previous year’s con-
tributions. The highest previous to-
tal was $30,666 in 1947. In 1949
the fund totaled $23,513.50.

John L. Payne, alumni secretary,
said that a total of 1300 alumni
and 117 friends of .the college par-
ticipated in the 1950 fund.

“The Alumni Fund,” Mr. Payne
said, “is entirely separate from the
$2,500,000 Development Program
which was successfully concluded
in June. That money is to be used
for endowment and for buildings.
The money in the Alumni Fund
is available for immediate use by
the college. A large number of Da.
vidson alumni contributed to the
Development Program and a great
number of them contributed to both
programs.”

The Alumni Fund at Davidson
was begun in 1939 by Treasurer F.
L. Jackson. During that year a

total of $2,365.15 was given. Since
then the college has received $233,-

Hall Selected By
Eu Lit. Society

Election of officers for the spring
semester and selection of new mem-
bers were the two main items of
a business meeting of the Euman-
ean Literary Society last Monday
night.

Hartley Hall was elected to suc-
ceed Ken Goodpasture as presi-
dent; Mr. Hall has tong been
known for his reddy wit, and his
tenure of office is awaited with
anticipation. Taking over the office
of vice-president from Pete Kalo-
gridis, Bill Adams is no stranger
to Eumanean duties, having served
as secretary last year. The man
with the real work to do is Frank
Hanshaw, who succeeds Larry Dag-
enhart as secretary. Since the trea.
surer’s job runs for the entire year,
Jack Hunter will keep the post of
treasurer.

More than 20 names, mostly those
of ‘second semester freshmen, were
submitted for consideration by the
society. A list of the new members
accepted by Eumanean will be re-
leased as soon as the names be-
come available.

In ROTC Gun Match
On N.C.State Campus

The Rifle Team traveled to Ral-
cigh last Saturday and defeated N.
C. State College, on their home
range, by the score of 1783 to 1767,
out of a possible 2,000. Each team
fired 10 men, the high S scores
counting. Davidson also had high
score for the 10 men of the team.
The match was comprised of firing
from 4 positions. High shot for the
Wildcats, and in the match, was
Aubrey Miree, with 373 out of 400.
Others in the high five, in order of
score, were: H. S. Ward, W. L.
Morris, F. McCutcheon and V. D.
Clifton. The § other members of the
team were: A. D. Groseclose, W.
W. Abbott, J. L. Baker, L. B.

Wildcats have scored 1940 and 1904
respectively, which are considered
very high scores, Last year’s nation.
