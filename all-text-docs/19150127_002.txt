A FIRE DEPARTMENT.

The narrow escape from a serious fire
at Dr. J. W. McConnell’s home last
week brings up again the spectre of a
town and college without absolutely no
fire protection. Werhin the last four
vears three large fires have occurred -in

avidson, and there have been several
near-fires. “The loss incurred in’ these
fires was probably no less than $10,000.

ft would seem folly now, premeditat-
ed folly, for the town and college to de-
lay any Jonger the organization of a fire
department, Not only in the town isa
house hopelessly gone if a fire is well
started, but on the campus there is al

ways a probability of a dormitory floor
or railing catching fire, and our present
apparatus of indiscriminate water thraw-
ing and wildly excited students would
accomplish little against. it.

If the town and college will unite in

the purchase of hose, ladders, — ropes,
buckets, and other fire-fighting — equip-
ment, we are sure that. the. Davidson

College men will he glad of the oppor.
tunity to organize and drill fire com.
panies. A thorough study ought to be
made of every home in Davidson: the
ways of entrance and exit, and the places
of water supply ought to be well known
to the leaders of the companies. Such
systems have been put in operation at
manv other colleges and universities in
small tewns and have been found ex-
ceedingly effective.

Then let us have a fire bell and not
trust to the ambiguous “fire” cry to call
out help.

If the town and- college will furnish
the equipment, we wall furnish the fire-
men to use it. Let us do something.

GREENVILLE CHAPTER
"GREATER DAVIDSON”

ALUMNI ASSOCIATION

By Fred W. Graham,

Chairman Phlicity Committee.

The object of every organization is
to unite the indiviruals, who are to be
members, to bring them into — closer
communion, to outline the work for
cach man, and to work to a common end.

With this end in view twenty-two
Davideon men responded to the call on
January oc. at Greenville, S.C. For a
number of years the Local Davidson
Alumni had considered the formation ;
of an Alumni Association, and now that
the organization is complete, it is the
hape and ambition of every man ta be
ef material aid to his Alma Mater.
With this end in view we clected the fol !
lowing officers: President, J. D. Waod

cide: First) Vice-President, Dro BE. P.
Davis; Second Vice-President, A. I
Viilis; “Vhird Vice-President, Vo Lake
Cely > Corresponding Secretary, H. Rus-

Villard, fro; Publicity Man, Fred W.
Graham.

Our President, Mr. J. D. Woodside,
has appointed a committee to draft By
Laws, and tt is our intention to cover
every field of endeavor to make the or-
ganization complete. With this end in
view we elected an athletic gmmittee
whose duty it shall be to arrange foot
ball and base ball games to be played in
Greenville between the Davidson. team
and cither Clemson, Tech., or whatever
schedule is agreeable to the manager of
the Davidson Athletic Association. In
this way we hope to create local interest,
and by this means secure new men for
Davidson each vear.

We also thought of having a debate
ence or twice a year cither between
Davidson men, or perhaps Davidson
men on one side and men from another
college on the other side. We have not
limited ourselves as to scope of our work,
and whatever we judge to be to the best
interest of Davidson, it shall be our en-
deavor to follow out.

We intend to send a copy of our By-
Laws, incorporating the aims. that we
have in mind, the committees that have
heen elected, the work of the different
committees, to the chairman of the
“Greater Davidson” Alumni Associa-
tion, and we hope that our organization
will be so perfected, that the Alumni in
other cities, wha are contemplating an
organization, will have the situation
mapped out, and may sce the ground to
be covered, which will facilitate matters
for them and enable the organization to
he completed with verv little difficulty.

Our experience has been that while a
number of men who wished to organize
have put the matter off from time to
time for the simple reason that we did
not know what to incorporate or what
points to bring up at the first meeting.
so for this reason the matter Jay dor-
mant for several vears.

It would be well to have a vearly
meeting at Davids6n, and each chapter
make it a point to send at least one man,
and every member attend if possible.

It is only through co-operation, hard
work, loyalty, and united efforts that
we may hope to realize our fondest am-
bition, and when a man is once a Dav-
idson man, he is one forever. “Chere is
a certain lovalty or attachment for Dav-
idson that every college cannot boast of.
but) our experience and observation is
that Davidson men work together. suffer
together, stand united, and vou will find
that spirit, predominate wherever vou
run across x body of Davidson men.

MISS SHAW REMEMBERED.

On last Christmas, a four — section
Glebe Wernicke book-case was present-
ed to Miss Cornelia Shaw. by the Stu-
dent Body. Miss Shaw is considered
the students’ best friend by every man
an the camons. and it is only asa slight
evidence of this feeling that this gift is
made.

Several students are in the Infirmarv
on account of grippe.
