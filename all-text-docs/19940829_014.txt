Football team heads to
the islands to play in
Bermuda Bowl

By Will Cobb

Big things are happening for
Davidson Football this season. Lit-
erally. An impressive group of 23
freshmen joined the team and the
addition of a season-ending trip to
Bermuda to face the University of
the South in the 2nd Annual Ber-
muda Bowl, making this season
something to look forward to.

After losing 19 players to
graduation, including four year
starters Richard Howell at quarter-
back and kicker Drew Fasett, many
people would consider 1994 a re-
building year. Not exactly.

“The players came back in
great shape, the best I’ve seen in
the five years I’ve been here. We
graduated a lot of linemen, but
we’ve brought ina lot of players,
too,” said second year head coach
Tim Landis.

The biggest losses occurred
on the offensive and defensive
lines. The coaching staff earned its
keep with a sugcessful recruiting
year, filling the holes left from

“graduation. The major concern for
a young team is lack of, playing
time, but the coaching staff re-
mains confident with the situation.

Davidson will face astiffchal-
lenge as it has gradually lost the
strength of previous teams to gradu-
ation. The Wildcats will have nine
freshmen this season.

“The initial anxiety I had has
dissipated,” coach Betsy Pryor said.
“With experience, they will come
along.”

- Intheir quest for another Deep
South crown, Davidson will miss

several key players from last sea-

son,

; “We lack experience coming
in, but we’re cautiously optimistic
about the outlook,” said Landis.

Quarterbacking the Wildcats
will be senior workhorse Kevin
Holzworth, the most deserving
person forthe job. After three years
as a backup, Holzworth will fi-
nally emerge at the helm.

“Texpect Kevin tohave a good
year. He’s healthy, has a great work
ethic, and is a super coreutils
said Landis.

Football games are won and
lost in the trenches, so timing and
strength on the line are invaluable.
The only experience returning on
the offensive line are Adam Gess
and John Cowan, so freshmen will
be making an immediate impact.
On the other hand, the rest of the
offense is set with seniors Bruce
Bannister and Shane Mills in the
backfield. Expect to see the Cats
pass more this year than the past so
receivers Kirk Roberts and Ike
Bailey willbe called on frequently.

The defense has just as many
open spots for the grabbing. Still,

and James Cassidy along with an-
chor Mills Arial will strengthen

The 1993 season was a big
success with a 6-4 record. There
are many unanswered questions
now for the Wildcats since camp
has lasted just one week.

time. Our defense will have to step
it up early to give the offense some
time to come around. I’m really

impressed with the freshmen.
Hopefully, everyone will stay
healthy,” said Landis. t

For the Wildcats, they have
time to work things out. The first
game will not be until September
17 at Maryville before returning
home for three games. The first
will be September 24 against
Emory & Henry for Homecoming.
All the hard work will have a re-
ward at the end of the season when
they compete in the Bermuda Bowl

on November 19.

“When you play football at
this level, you play because you
love the game. This is a great re-
ward for young men that work
hard at everything they do,” said
Landis.

There isn’t a more deserving
group on campus than the football
players, for their effort and contri-
bution to the school on and off the
field.
