THE BATTALION OF THE R. O. T. C. UNIT AT DAVIDSON COLLEGE

Davidson College Students and Alumni

Prominent in War Service of Country

Almost One Thousand Davidson
Men Enter Army During World
War—Twenty Make Supreme
Sacrifice in Service of
Their Country

When war was declared with the Central
Powers in 1917, the response of Davidson
men was as representative and as fine as it
was in 1861, when North Carolina linked her

fortunes with the new-born Confederacy.

To camps and field service 150 students
slipped away from the campus between April,
1917, and Armistice Day, 1918. Singly and
in groups they left us. Of this number 55
were in the Senior classes of the period. Of
the class of 1918 three men enlisted immedi-
ately on their graduation, and the three died
in camps in the weeks of the following
October.

In the late spring of 1917 80 students were
excused from further class work to help in
food production on Southern farms, and dur-
ing the summer of 1918, four professors and
33 students went, at the request of the gov-
ernment, to take intensive military training at
Plattsburg. Later, in the vacation, however;
the college authorities offered the plant to
the Government for the establishment of a
Student Army Training Corps.

Vivid in the memory of those present is
the scene that took place, south of Shearer
Hall, at noon of October 1, 1918, when were
gathered the 223 students—all who were over

“18 years of age, and physically fit—to také
the oath of fealty to America, and become
members of this corps. Even while the young
men stood at attention, one here and there
dropped out, and on that day began the epi-
demic of influenza, that put the corps out of
commission for three weeks, and made of the
college an improvised hospital.

So far as has been ascertained, 580 alumni
entered service. Of the total number, 959,
of students and alumni, 368 were commis-
sioned officers and 20 made the supreme sac-
rifice in battle clash at Cantingny, at Cha-
teau-Thierry, in the Argonne, at Belleau
Wood, or in camp hospitals.

From the north wall of the reading room
18 of their faces look down upon the stu-
dents of the college, to whom they threw the
torch when their own hands faltered. With
their portraits hangs that of their command- ;
er-in-chief, whose boyish feet walked our
campus back in the seventies, and who, indi-
rectly, gave his life in the same great cause.

“Rastus, does you love me?”
“Mandy, you is one woman I
love none other no better than.”

Chief of Infantry
Writes Greetings

Hearing that The Davidsonian was issuing
a special R. O. T.
with the inspection for distinguished rating,
Maj. Gen. R. H. Allen, Chief of Infantry,
United States Army, sent greetings to the
students of Davidson in the form of a letter
to Capt. George H. Weems. The section of
the letter having special interest to the mem-
bers of the R. O. T. C. Battalion follows:
“To the Students Davidson

Greetings :

C. edition in connection

of College,

The right to bear arms is the privilege of
every American citizen. It is his duty to be
prepared to defend his country and his home.
Our country is unquestionably innocent ot
any design of militarism or desire for ag-
gression. We covet no other lands. but we
do wish with supreme intensity to be secure
in our own domain and free to enjoy the
advantages which Providence has bestowed
upon us.

In order properly to protect our beloved
country and to defend our institutions we
must have leaders, both in peace and in war—
men who understand the necessity for co-
operation and team work, men whom others
will be glad to look up to and to follow.
Military training is a means, and a most im-
portant one, for developing leadership in
young men and for developing in them a
sense of responsibility for themselves and for
others. It is hence a vital necessity in the
youthful training of every American patriot.

I am especially gratified that we have an
infantry unit at Davidson College. In case
of an emergency the R. O. T. C. will be the
source from which the men to command our
infantry on the field of battle must come and
the records of your college show that you
have been ready to assume this great respon-
sibility.

It is a pleasure to be afforded this oppor-
tunity to greet you and to wish you every
success for the future.”

R. H. Allen,
Major General, Chief of Infantry.

GREETINGS TO OUR
GUESTS

It is with pleasure we welcome
our distinguished visitors from the
War Department, Major Edward
A. Stockton, Coast Artillery Corps,
and Major Thomas
General Staff.

Davidson is not a Military Col-
lege, but it has a strong R. O. T. C.
department which, under the effi-
cient guidance of Captain Weems
and his associated officers, has de-
veloped to such a point of excel-
lence as to be recommended for in-
spection to discover if it may rank
as a Distinguished College in this
department.

J. Johnson,

These gentlemen come to us for
this purpose. With our cordial
welcome we gladly extend to them
every courtesy pertaining to the
occasion and express the wish that
they may enjoy their visit to us and
leave us satisfied that the Davidson
Corps is worthy of hearty commen-
dation.

WM. J. MARTIN,

President

Natural Questions Answered in
Account of Lives of Men

Two Visitors Are Prominent in
Many Activities of Army Life

The first question that arises in the mind
of men when about to meet another man is,
“What kind of a man is he?” and the second
question is, “What is his personal history ?”

These questions are always uppermost in
the minds of military men when they are
about to be inspscted by higher authority and
the members of the R. O. T. C. unit of Da-
vidson College are no exceptions to this rule.

Inspectors are usually good scouts, and that
statement answers the first question. With
regard to the second question more definite
information can be given.

To begin with Maj. Edward A. Stockton,
Jr.: he was appointed to the U. S. Military
Academy at West Point in 1908 and served
with distinction throughout the World War,

| with the Chemical War Service. He was a
| lieutenant colonel when the war closed, hay-
ing risen to this grade from the grade of cap-
|tain. After the war Major Stockton trans-
' ferred to the Coast Artillery Corps, in which
branch of the service he now serves.

Major Stockton is a son of Mr. Edward
iA. Stockton, who is the comptroller of the
Pennsylvania Railroad System, and the
brother of Maj. Max R. Stockton, who is
an eye, ear, nose and throat surgeon of broad

Major Stockton was originally from Phila-
delphia and is ,therefore, filled with a spirit
lof brotherly love. He has the reputation of
being able to make a good speech and of en-

joying a quiet pipe filled with good weed.

He graduated from the Coast Artillery |
School in 1916,

Maj.: Thomas J. Johnson graduated from
the Military Academy and was appointed
second lieutenant of infantry in 1908. Being
from Kentucky, he tired of dismounted serv-!
ice after about six years and transferred to
field artillery. Although now a member of
the general staff, he is reported to still be an |
ardent artilleryman. He is a horseman of
note and a member of the Riding and Hunt |
Club of Washington, D. C. |

Major Johnsdn rose to the rank of lieuten- |
ant-colonel during the World War. He is a
