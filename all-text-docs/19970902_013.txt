COLUMBIA, S.C. — Last year, the
women’s soccer team upset South Carolina be-
hind the performances of freshmen Amy
Balsinger and Ginny Dye. This season, the Game-
cocks returned the favor as their star rookie,
Jessica Workman, scored two goals to lead USC.

Within the first 10
minutes, captain Kelly
Schmidt went down
with a sprained left
ankle, leaving the
Wildcats with a hole to fill.

“That was the difference,’ coach Kevin
Hundley said. “Without Kelly, they were quicker
than we were.”

Davidson struck first on a goal by Dye. The
play was set up when Amy Kanoff sent a corner
kick to Balsinger, who tapped it towards Dye.

The Gamecocks scored ‘two quick goals,
though, to take a 2-1 halftime lead.

After the break, Wildcat rookie Mandy
Kinane notched her first career tally.

But the Gamecocks scored the eventual
game-winner less than two minutes later.

“At this level, when you make a mistake,
they punish you,” Hundley added.

Schmidt’s ankle will keep -her out indefi-
nitely. Leila Wormuth suffered an MCL injury
Saturday in practice and will also be out indefi-

nitely.

all smothered us. I swear to God, I
thoughtI was going to die. Sampers
was on his back and our faces were
mashed together. It was scary. I
remember that very well, thinking,
‘This is hilarious. We're actually
going to die because we'’ re celebrat-
ing too much.’”

God-like tendencies
The Wildcats didn’t like Coastal
Carolina one bit.
The 1992 Chanticleers were a
sketchy bunch, questionable at best.
Several Coastal players had been

suspended earlier in the season af-.

ter they were found.to have played
professionally in Europe. Others’
eligibility remained debatable, and
many wondered out loud why the
. NCAA had even granted the Chan-
ticleers a bid in the first place.

In addition, they had personally
angered Slagle before the ‘season
ever began, vehemently refusing to
reschedule the two teams’ Oct. 24
meeting. As a result, the Wildcats
were forced to travel, to Conway,
S.C., a mere week after the UCLA
trip and less than 24 hours after they
had hosted Georgia Southern in a
league matchup.

This, more so than even the
UNCC clash, was a grudge match.

“We couldn’t stand Coastal,”
Spear said. “They were really big
jerks. They would talk crap to you,
hit you while you were down, that
kind of thing.

“We just thought there was no
way we should lose to these guys.
They weren’t worthy as people of
moving on.”

But after 150 minutes of play in
miserable conditions on a muddy,
almost icy surface at Richardson
Field, Davidson and Coastal stood
deadlocked at 0-0. Once again, the
Wildcats were forced intoa shootout
for the right to advance.

And, if it hadn’t already, this is

_ where Davidson’s storybook run
reached make-believe proportions.

On three separate occasions, a

Chanticleer had the opportunity to
win it with a single kick, and was in
each instance denied by the 5-foot-
9-inch Deegan, who stuffed
Coastal’s fifth, seventh, and ninth
attempts.

“Stopping three in a row was just
miraculous,” Spear said. “I think he
sensed our strength and we sensed
his. I mean, that was way, way
beyond normal.”

Slagle went a step further: “We
were looking at Deegan’s geneal-
ogy at that point to see if he had any
God-like tendencies.”

“T just couldn’t believe we were
in that situation. I was struggling to
keep myself in check emotionally,”
said Deegan, who can be seen in
clips muttering to himself before
and after each kick.

“Luck was on my side. Maybe I
made my own luck, but luck defi-
nitely played a great part in that.”

Finally, after freshman Ryan
Northington converted Davidson’s
10th try, Deegan ended the insanity
by tipping Billy Johnstone’s shot
onto the crossbar, where it hung for
asecond— “‘aneternity,” as Deegan
said — before it finally spun onto
the top of the netting and stayed
there.

“He realizes he’s won the game
and starts sprinting around the field
with most of the student population
following him,” Slagle said. “It
was quite a sight.”

“T was running for fear of getting
trampled,” Deegan explained.

And Davidson, the season hav-
ing by this point extended beyond
even its wildest dreams, was headed
for the round of eight.

Triple-teamed
One game away from the Final
Four, State’s game plan was simple:
Shut down Ukrop, shut down
Davidson.

Early in the game, Ukrop — the °

country’s leading scorer that sea-
son with 31 goals and 10 assists —
came over to the Wildcat sideline to

_get some water. Three members of

the Wolfpack followed him. .

“It was a real nice compliment,”
Ukrop said. “I asked them if they
wanted any.”

And, for the most part, the strat-
egy worked, as Davidson couldn’t
put the ball in the back of the net.

Problem was, State couldn’t
score either, as the Wildcats — with
some more Deegan magic — held
the high-octane Wolfpack in check
through two overtimes.

Finally, at the 131:47 mark in
sudden death, Spear took a free kick
from the right corner. In the middle
of the pack, the ball landed on
Ukrop’s chest — virtually the first
time he had been left alone all after-
noon — and the superstar drilled it
low and through a crowd.

Game, set, match.

“It’s not really a dream come
true,” Ukrop told the Raleigh News
& Observer. “Because I never even
dreamed about this.”

“We were going home anyway,”
Slagle said after the game. “To be
playing is great.”

From the library |

Alex Yannis covered the Wild-
cats’ run for the New York Times
and has since started writing for the
New York/New Jersey MetroStars
of Major League Soccer.

“The MetroStars’ home opener in
1996 was against the New England
Revolution, for which Ukrop then
played and started. A crowd of
48,000 showed up at the Meadow-
lands.

After the game, Yannis’ spotted
Ukrop and struck up a conversa-
tion.

“That was a great crowd,” he
said. “But the loudest I’ve ever
heard a crowd was when you guys
(Davidson) scored your first goal
against San Diego (in the national
semi).”

That goal, aheaderby Ben Hayes,
gave the Wildcats'a 1-0 lead a mere
7:51 into the contest and sent the

Richardson Field crowd ‘of 8,150:

— not counting the hundreds of

students watching from the top of
Duke and through the windows of
the library — into a state of hyste-
ria.

But the Toreros, battling the
crowd just as much as they were the
Wildcats themselves, responded
with almost back-to-back goals —
the equalizer at 37:30 and the go-
ahead tally at 38:44 — to take a 2-
| halftime lead.

The game stayed that way until
the 61:34 mark, when San Diego’s
Alex Streicek inadvertently pushed
the ball past Torero keeper Scott
Garlick into his own goal, tying the
game at 2-2.

“T was looking over my shoulder
at that point,” Slagle said. —

“There was no question in my
mind that, when they put the own
goal in, we were going to win this
game.”

But San Diego ended up being
the one to score in the second OT, as
the Toreros advanced to Sunday’s
final against powerhouse Virginia.

‘22 Educated Feet’
The Cavaliers knocked off USD,
but the storyline that weekend re-
mained the Wildcats, a team — a

, team — which mesmerized the na-

tion on a four-week ride of ideals.

With everything that is wrong
with college sports these days,
Davidson’s 1992 soccer team was
right.

“We did it in what I would call
the old-fashioned way,” Slagle said.
“These guys were all students.
There was nobody who was re-
cruited on scholarship, and only a
couple guys were getting financial
aid.”

They were, asa New York Times
headline said, “22 Educated Feet.”

Members of the team attended
class Friday morning — the biggest
game of their lives less than 12
hours away — and many took tests,
a concept that, at the very least,
intrigued the national media.

“That made it all the more satis-
fying,” Slagle added. ‘To the ca-

sual observer, they figured we had
tohave scholarships and people who
barely qualified academically. But
that wasn’t true. Soccer just hap-
pened to be one extra thing they did
while at school.”

Which is exactly why the experi-
ence was so special for everyone
involved — from students to pro-
fessors to administrators to alums
to townspeople. The 22 members
of that team were soccer players,
indeed, but they were also frater-
nity brothers, student government
officers, and average Joes. They
were students of Davidson College
first, soccer players second.

“We did it for them (students,
faculty, and administrators), Spear
explained. “We were trained by
them. We learned from them. They
were our idols, and we didn’t want
to be idolized by them.

“We were carrying the flag for
Davidson College. Not only for us
and our coaches and our families
and forthe other athletes, but for the
whole student body. We wanted
them to feel like they were part of
it.”

And they did. Perhaps the
Davidsonian’s Matt Bumstead cap-
tured that sentiment best in his col-
umn on Jan. 25, 1993.

“None of us will soon, if ever,
forget the sound of a cannon-like
thud, the look of fear in a hapless
defender’s eyes, and the image of
1992’s top scorer running past the
crowd, pumping his fist or holding
his arms out to us as if to say, “That
was for you, Davidson,””’ he wrote.

“Nor will we forget that little
blur of yellow that flew through the
air in ways we thought only hap-
pened in movies, and somehow kept
the ball out of the goal...

“You played out our greatest fan-
tasies on the soccer field. Every
week, you faced Goliath, you drilled
him, and you took us with. you...

“Maybe the soccer team showed
us a real light in a place we never
would have thought to look. Thanks,
guys. You did us proud.”
