The Davidson Hi-Y Club held a
short business meeting in the Y.
M. C. A. Social Center last Mon-
day. evening for the purpose of
making plans to attend the Father
and Son Banquet held in Charlotte
on Friday night. The club also
decided to run a candy store at
the high school in order to build up
the local treasury. After a brief dis-
cussion on the latter topic the]
meeting was dismissed so the mem-
bers could attend the French lec-
ture held in Chambers Auditorium.

On Friday night the club car-
ried out its Monday plans by at-
tending the Father and Son Ban-

was the principle speaker of the
occasion. He chose for his subject
“Father and Sons’ Relationship.”

gram Was a stunt presented by the
Davidson group. The stunt was
called “Steal Away.” The fathers
from Davidson who were present
were: Dr, K. J. Foreman, the Rev.
Mr. Crane, Prof. W. W. Wood,
Prof. Fulcher and Prof. E. J. Er-
win. The banquet was thorough-
ly enjoyed by all who attended.

Early this week it was learned

that efforts were being made to
establish a Hi-Y chapter ‘in’ the

Davidson group heartily approved
of this movement and all members
pledged to do all in their power to
get a good chapter started at Hun-
tersville.

SO YOUR

especially in new shoes

MISTER, here is something you can doabout it:

There is a new kind of shoe
that really conforms to your
foot, WITHOUT “BREAK-
ING IN.” Regular standard
shoes have a stiff steel shank
under the arch—THIS ONE
Is SEWED INSTEAD, in
one piece from toe to heel.
No nails. It fits like your
own skin, and gives live sup-
port that makes foot muscles
young. Let us show you
our amazing demonstration.
