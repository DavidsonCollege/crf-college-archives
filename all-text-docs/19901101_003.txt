think, he said.

But beyond being judged on
individual accomplishments, Mar-
tin said, “the right question to ask
is if we have courage.” And he
continued, “If we see it in our chil-
dren or our parents, we’ ll remem-
ber it.”

He said Davidson College has
been successful in its liberal arts
mission by teaching people to dis-
tinguish between what abides and
what is passing, and he called that
ability “the cornerstone of cour-
age.”

“To my mind, the core cur-
riculum of Davidson College is
courage,” he concluded.

Martin’s address was answered
with a standing ovation. Then,
presentation of awards filled the
latter half of the convocation pro-
gram.

Benjamin J. Klein, Professor
of Mathematics, received the
Thomas Jefferson Award. It is
presented annually to a faculty
member. who. by personal _influ-
ence, service, teaching, writing and
scholarship promotes high ideals.

Dean of the Faculty Robert
Williams, in making the award,
said, “He is dependable, energetic
and insightful. He is utterly con-
scious and devoted to the welfare
of Davidson College. Like Tho-
mas Jefferson, who sorely wanted
to lead a private life of reflection
and husbandry, but was always
being called upon. to serve his

country, he has sacrificed much of
his private life to serve the larger
interest of the college.”

Williams also announced that
Klein and Anthony S. Abbott,
Professor of English, have been
named by the trustees as Dana
Professors in recognition of their
high esteem among colleagues.
Alexander J..McKelway was
named_as-the Paul B. Freeland
Professor of Religion at the same
time.

The other faculty award was
public recognition of the previ-
ously announced George Polya
Math Award for Richard D. Neid-
inger, associate professor of mathe-
matics. The Polya award is be-
stowed by the Mathematical Asso-
ciation of America for outstanding
expository writing in its journal.
