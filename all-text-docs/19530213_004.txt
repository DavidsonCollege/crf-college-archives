One of the top wrestling events
in the South, the Carolinas AAU
show was won last year by Ap

Marines Favored

Since Appalachian didn’t field a
wrestling squad this season, the
Marines will be favored in this
year’s event, and they have already
indicated that they will send a
large contingent.

Davidson’s Coach Charlie Parker
hasn’t yet decided who his entries
will be, but the Cat grappling
squad should offer several contest-
ants.

Examination For Advertising To Be Held
At Queens For Those Interested In Field

The seventh nation-wide exam-
ination for advertising will be held
at Queens College in Charlotte on
February 14 and 21, it was an-
nounced today by the Southeastern
Chapter of the American Associa-
tion of Advertising Agencies.

Tread Covington, advertising ex-
ecutive and chairman of the A. A.
A. A. Examination Committee,
stated that the tests will be open
to all who are considering adver-
tising as a career, including college
seniors.

“The examination is given an-
nually throughout the country to
attract high calibre young people
to advertising,” Covington said. “It
provides a series of aptitude-temp-
erament tests compiled by special-
ists in’ personnel testing and a
group of tests of practical know-

“Through these tests the relative-
ly inexperienced person can see
how his abilities compare with
those of more than 4,500 people
now employed in advertising. In
this way we hope to encourage and
guide people who show promise for
advertising and save others from
months, perhaps years in the wrong
work.”

The aptitude-temperament sec-
tion of the examination will be
held February 14. Additional tests
of practical knowledge for people
with training in advertising will be
given February 21.

A fee of $20 will be charged to
cover part of the cost of the ex.
amination. For additional informa-
tion and application blanks, write
