whatever the conversation is about,
you can be sure it is on the lighter

terviews and other final testing for
the Bakers and other scholarships.

In addition to Baker scholarships
there are other outstanding awards.
The Union Carbide and Carbon
Corporation makes possible eight
Union Carbide scholarships cover-
ing tuition, fees, and books. They
are for students intending to seek
a career in business.

The Procter and Gamble com-
pany awarded a scholarship this
year to a Davidson freshman, and
will add more in the future. They
are similar to the Union Carbides
scholarships in value.

Other special scholarships are
the Harding-Johnson and Thomas
F. Staley Memorial Scholarships.
Staley scholars are outstanding
ministerial candidates.

The Nickey Brothers Manufactur-
ing Company of Memphis, Tenn..
awards each year a full tuition-fees-
books scholarship, and there are
some 20 other honor and special
scholarships offered by the college
on a competitive basis.

These are not the only awards
granted. The budget for grants this
year is $35,000. About $30,000 of
these are specifically for football.
All athletes who receive these
grants must meet Davidson en-
trance requirements and must first
be approved by a faculty scholar-

On the other hand, the = subjects
with the cardboard discs under-
estimated the size of each disc, al-
though their estimations were
nearer the actual size than any of
the estimations made with coins as
the stimulus.

In the first experiment men-
tioned, it was seen that the atti-
tude toward the Negro did affect
the perception of the size of the
disc; and in the second experi-
ment, we find two sub-conscious
factors at work—the fact that poor-
er subjects valued the coins to a
greater degree, and the fact that
coins had reward-value for all sub-
jects. From these experiments, and
other similar ones, we are thus led
to believe that unconscious factors
definitely do affect what we see,
and how we see it.

activities, the chapter sponsors
several special concerts, assists in
the Fine Arts Festival, and has’

On December 2-3 the chapter plays
host to the North Carolina-South
Carolina province chapters of the
fraternity, which will meet here
for the bi-annual Province Con-
vention.

The first musical program for
the fraternity this year was pre-
sented last Tuesday evening by
Prof. Philip Gehring. The meeting
convened in the church sanctuary,
with brothers and newly-elected
pledges in attendance. Mr. Gehring
gave a_ lecture-demonstration on
the organ. His was a broad-sweep-
ing introduction to the organ as an
instrument with individuality and
a personality all its own. Much of
his lecture was devoted to the
mechanics, the history, and the de-
velopment of the instrument, as
well as a straight-forward defense
of organ literature, both historic
and contemporary. The conclusion
of the talk was a stirring appraisal
of the Schlicker Organ in the Col-

lege Church.
