No, Pick It

Well, there aré a lot of things
Icould write about this week - too
many to choose from, really. But
I don’t know that I’ll have this
chance again - not for four years,

twocents about tomorrow’ s Presi-
dential election. ;

I refuse, however, to use
Whistlin’ Dixie vote as a soapbox
from which george to preach my
bush particular political views.
That’s not or what this ross col-
umn is about perot, and I simply
clinton won’t sink to that level
stinks. I just wouldn’t do that.

Instead, I thought it might be
a little tension breaker on this
election eve to look at some poli-
| tics - country style.

Now, certain artists have defi-
nite stands. Those of you who
were glued to the television on
September 30th and saw Mary-
Chapin Carpenter win the award
for Best Female Vocalist at the
CMA Awards (... by the way, am
I prophetic or what? But that’s
another story - we’ll pat me on the
back later) saw her Clinton/Gore
button, —

Clinton/Gore in country mu-
sic? Shocking? Well, for one
thing, she went to Brown.

Enough said.

For another, she certainly
would not be the only person in
the country music world to feel
that way. Just because liberals are
the favorite food of your average
redneck does not mean that coun-
try music runs from the Demo-
crats. Firstof all, don’t forget that
country music performers, writ-
ers, etc. are, contrary to the beliefs
of some pathetic boobs, artists.
And many artists love “liberal”
causes.

Also, remember that the av-
erage listener of country music is
in the middle class - maybe in the
South, headquarters of the “yel-
low dog” democrats.

So, yes, many of your favor-
ites will probably cast one for Bill
and Al’s Excellent Adventure.

Then there’s Randy Travis,
who happens to be Bush’s favor-
ite artist. Does that mean he’ll
vote for George and Danforth?
Well, Idon’tknow anything about
Randy’s political views; but
Randy probably owes the Prez a
few, at least for “Point of Light,”
which Bush commissioned for
Randy Travis to sing.

Who’ll vote for the little man
with the big surprise? Well, Mark
Chesnutt, Clint Black, and George
Straitare all Texans (and Chesnutt
and Black are short); so Perot may
be their man. Between him and
Bush, they’ll have divided loyal-
ties, I’m sure. °

Don’t even ask Charlie
Daniels for whom he’s voting.
Listen tothe songs “Uneasy Rider”

anyway; so I, too, must get in my |

Matt Bumstead-Whistlin' Dixie

Rock the Vote?

or “Simple Man” (along with half
of his other songs), and you'll
know that he is about as fond of
someone perceived as a draft-

dodger/anti-war demonstrator as

he is of having his fingernails
torn off. Bush all the way.

Billy Ray Cyrus? hmmm.
Lots of hype, but his songs don’t
really have much to say. Sounds
likea Perot followerto me. (noth-
ing personal, Mr. Perot)

Clinton’s followers will be
numerous as well; as I said, art-
ists are more liberal-minded. But
country music has soared under
the Bush administtation, and
many performers might be too
superstitious to bite the hand un-.
der which they’ve rich. Still,
musicians would have to love a
President whocouldhave nightly
sax jam sessions with them.

Garth? Well, I asked Jenn
Beahm for some confirmation;
and we agreed that he’s probably
aBushman (which will, I’m sure,
sway many. of you to vote
Clinton). Did you notice that
“We Shall Be Free,” while radi-
cal for country music, said noth-
ing about abortion? Smart move,
Garth; you’re a real politician. . .
. Hey ! That gives me an idea. .

Well, if for no other reason,
Garth probably will avoid Clinton
atall costs; with the upper bracket
tax increase, he knows his taxes
will be about twenty million dol-
lars.

The point is this: I really
don’t know for whom these
people are going to vote; and you

know what? I don’t care. I like it |:

that way. If I want political ad-
vice, I’m not going to go to a
movie star, a professional ath-
lete, oracountry music performer.
That’ snot whatinterests me about
them. And what do they know,
anyway?

Oh, sure, everyone in the
public eye should feel a responsi-
bility to make a statement for that
in which he or she believes. And
certainly everyone, celebrity or
not, should feel free to support,
verbally or otherwise, the candi-
date of his or her choice.

And I do like to know that
the people whose records I buy or
whose games I watch are good,
honest people. But goodness and
politics, as we all know, are not
the same story. Unfortunately,
I’m sometimes not even sure that
they’re in the same library.

Something else I like about
country music is that I don’thave
to hear about politics and other
such rigamarole when I turn to it.
I get enough of that during the
day; and, quite frankly, I don’t
want the writer’s or performer’s

for a dirty magazine or something
because there are none. Anyway,
thismovie’s problemscan be boiled
down to a simple statement: in an
attempt to be at least as clever as
Basic Instinct, the film leaves a
muddled plot that becomes unbe-
lievable and an apathetic cast to
make sense of it all. (Besides, their

main babe here ain’t got nothing
on Sharon Stone anyway). Atip to
the producers: the dollar is in the
mail so as soon as you get it you
can go outand buy aclue with it, or
at the very least a halfway decent
script. :
