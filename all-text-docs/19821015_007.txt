unification of all races within South
Africa. Some of its members, like the
six who are coming to Davidson, felt
that they could accomplish more by
leaving the country.

The six A. N. C. members are tour-
ing the Southeast in order to raise funds _
for a proposed school. It is necessary for
them to search outside of South Africa
for funding, because the government of
that country will not allocate money to
build schools in the wasteland areas
where many of the blacks are sent. They
will instead build the school in neigh-
boring Tanzania so as to educate de-
prived citizens on the other side of the
border.

New Athletic
Facility in’
Planning Stage

DUNCAN FRASER ’86

Davidson College is considering
building a new 5.5 million dollar athlet-
ic complex to replace the aging John-
ston Gymnasium. According to Vice-
president for Development Dr. Jack
Powers, “The current gym is inadequate
as it was built for a student body of 800,
far below the present enrollment of
1400,” and Johnston gym was built for
an all-male college and is inadequate for
today’s co-ed student body.

Powers says that the site for the new

gym is at the far end of the current soc-
cer field, allowing a new access road
and parking space for intercollegiate
events. Tentative models have been
built, but final blueprints for the build-
ing and the entire project is still in the
planning stage. However, the most like-
ly design calls for a modern architectu-
ral style consistent with Vail Commons
and the E.H. Little Library.

The entrance would be through a
huge, glass-walled central core with
three main wing extensions. One sec-
tion will contain a pool capable of host-
ing intercollegiate competitions, a se-
cond will house an indoor track, tennis
courts, raquetball courts, and gymnastic
facilities, while the third will be a bas-
ketball/volleyball arena with a seating
capacity in the range of 3500-5000 per-
sons. Major basketball games will con-
tinue to played in the Colesium in Char-
lotte.

Powers said that although “the col-
lege will not consider a commitment to
begin construction until one or more
major donors” contribute toward the
1982 price tag of $5.5 million, there is
the possibility that the facility could be
built in sections as money is forthcom-
ing.

The plan for the complex is a part of
the 1987 plan which forsaw a need in
1987 for a new commons and renova-
tion of the Martin labs, both of which
have been completed. Additionally, the
plan calls for space for the mathematics
department, space for the visual arts,
and an athletic complex. Currently,
plans are being considered for renovat-
ing Johnston Gymnasium at an estimat-
ed cost of $1 million, into a visual arts
gallery on the ground floor with an aud-
itorium above.

DC President
Participates
in Advisory
Panel

Dr. Samuel R. Spencer Jr., president of

. Davidson College, is one of 12 promi-

nent educators, foundation executives
and representatives of the private sector
who have been invited to participate Oc-

tober 18 in the organizational meeting

of an Advisory Panel on International
Educational Exchange. Invitations to
memberships were extended by Charles
Z. Wick, director of USIA.

Under the terms of its charter, the
panel will advise Wick by studying
worldwide scholarly and demographic
trends, helping to link the public and
private sectors in support of educational
exchanges, and identifying issues in the
field of international education ex-
change. Its basic purpose is to examine
ways in which academic exchanges can
further international understanding be-
tween the U.S. and other nations.

Spencer, who currently serves as
chairman of the Board of Foreign Schol-
arships, has a long-standing interest in
international education. He served as a
Fulbright Lecturer at the University of
Munich in 1965—66, and has twice re-
turned to Germany as a guest lecturer. A
native of Rock Hill, S.C., Spencer at-

tended Davidson College and earned his
Ph.D. in history before returning to Da-
vidson as assistant to the president in
1951. He became dean of students and
associate professor of history in 1954,
and was named professor in 1955. In
1957 Spencer became president of Mary
Baldwin College in Virginia. He as-
sumed the presidency at Davidson in
1968.

The panel will meet at USIA head-
quarters in Washington D.C. Its man-
date will expire at the end of two years,
unless it is renewed by the USIA direc-
tor.
