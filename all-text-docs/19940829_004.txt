Cambridge students
discover England

By Laura Jefferson

If you happen to bump into
twenty-one Davidson students and
one English professor speaking
with a slight British accent, you
have found the 1994 Cambridge
Summer Program participants.
This summer, students from
Davidson invaded Cambridge Uni-
versity Campus to study 18th cen-
tury British literature and history.

Dr. Vivien Dietz coordinated
the 14th annual. trip to England
with the help of professor in resi-
dence Dr. Elizabeth Mills. For six
weeks, DC students attended lec-
tures discussing such topics as Wil-
liam Blake, the Industrial Revolu-
tion, the Gothic Revival, and 18th
century insects. Aside from lec-
tures, students attended tutorials
twice a week to debate topics dis-
cussed in lectures and also wrote
several papers. ;

However, DC students were

able to escape Cambridge Univer-
sity academics with free weekends
and one full week of vacation in
the middle of the program. By the
end of the six weeks, students and
professor had ventured to most ar-
eas of England and Scotland. A
select few even made it to Ireland.

’ From afternoon tea at the Bath
Pump House to punting down the
Cam River to a little bird on Will-
iam Wordsworth’s grave to the
crown jewels to the King’s Col-
lege Evensong to extensive “‘pub-
crawling” at such local dives as
The Castle Inn, the Davidson group
saw and did it all.

Participant Lexy DeVane
says, “My two fondest memories
of the Cambridge Program will
always be horseback riding up Mt.
Snowden in Wales and running
into the National Star Trek Con-
vention in Glasgow. Ialsoenjoyed
agood night’s sleep and metcount-

mer Program participants included

Ashlyn Dannelly, Julie Dawson,

Cabell, Emily Davis, Anne

Bonner Scholars
serve globally

By Lisa Lyons
Tonya Harding is not the only
one who did newsworthy commu-
nity service this summer.
Davidson’s Bonner Scholars vol-

unteeréd more than 15,000 hours”

in cities, towns, and villages across
the globe. Unlike ex-Olympian
Harding, Bonner Scholars do ser-
vice work in lieu of Work Study
during the academic year, and do-
nate additional time during the
summer.

In the past three months,
Bonner Scholars volunteered at a
variety of hospitals, schools,
camps, and churches around the
world—such as working at
Davidson’s Love of Learning, in
the backwoods of Maine, or on a
ranch in Honduras. _

Junior Tasha Jenkins interned
. atthe Center for Urban Missions in
' Alabama. “Birmingham, 35201 is

not the title of a TV series; it’s one
of the poorest areas in the coun-
_try.” Rather than attend summer
school or work in_a law firm,
Jenkins taught photography classes
as well as leadership development
to inner-city youth. —
“If I had done it for creditor
a paycheck, it just wouldn’t have
been the same. The director of the
program is a Davidson alum and
former lawyer who is now involved
with child advocacy. This is an

area that I’m really interested in,
and he was a great inspiration. I
couldn’t have gotten this type of
experience anywhere else.”

In addition to participating in

‘Various individual prdjécts; a group”

of Bonners travelled to Puerto Rico
for a student-initiated service
project. Fifteen Bonner Scholars
worked in Camuy,’ painting mu-
rals, promoting a cleaner environ-
ment, and playing with kids in an
orphanage. Second-year Bonner
Josh Gaffga says he would not
hesitate to go back. “It was the
greatest experience. The kids re-
ally looked up to us. Even though
I don’t speak a lick of Spanish, I
had a real special time. I know we
made those kids happy.” The sum-
mer was full of similar highlights
for many Bonners.

As the inaugural Bonner class
begins its senior year, the number
of Bonner Scholars on campus has

swelled from 25 to 83. Welcome. |
to all the new Bonners and to:

Katherine Cooke ’93, the
program’s new coordinator. Soon
the Bonner Scholars will begin
working in the community; you
can, too. Mark your calendars for
the Volunteer Fair, September 7
from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. in the Gal-
lery. Get involved—you will not
be able to pick up Life Experience
101 at drop/add this week.

On May 25, 1994, Dr. Luis
Pena and 14 Davidson students
boarded an airplane headed for
Guadalajara, Mexico. The group
studied Spanish for'seven weeks
and travelled in Mexico.

Students took two-classes
taught ‘by either Dr. Pena or a
Guadalajaran woman. Outside of
Classtime students THiét 6ne of one’
with college-age students to see
the lifestyle and culture of México
and to practice Spanish.

Courses ranged from interme-
diate Spanish to politics as seen
through the media. Assignments
and work load depended on the
class taken; some students had to
keep a daily journal in Spanish and
write compositions every week.

Students also lived witha fam-
ily while in Guadalajara. This ar-
rangement allowed the students to
learn aspects of a foreign culture
not taught in a classroom. Partici-
pant Linn Allison ’95 says “it was
a great, unique experience, quite.a
change from growing up in a rural
Virginia town.”

On weekends the program
took excursions both ° in
Guadalajara and ‘in Other locations
around the country. The first week-
end they visited Talaquepaque, a
small town outside of Guadalajara,
and then travelled to a ranch out-
side of the city to relax and enjoy
the equivalent of a mountain home
in the States.

Three weeks into the program,
the group took an eight hour bus
ride to Mexico City, the largest

- city in the world. While there, they

saw the ancient pyramids of

lores Mexico

Teotiuacan and the grand Aztec
pyramid in the center of the city.
Other day trips from Mexico
city included Cuernavaca and
Taxco, the silver mining capital of
the ocuntry. Afterrecovering from
their week trip to Mexico City, the
group took a weekend to go to
Guanauto; naturally preserved
mummies provide the main attrac-
tion of the mining town, which is
also 'the birthplace of artist/mural-
ist Diego Rivera. They also saw a
ghost town, the:grave of a famous
mariachi Jimenez (the equivalent
in fame and “cult status” of Elvis),
and San Miguel de Allende, a tiny
town filled with artists and tour-

ists.

After classes ended, the pro-
gramcelebrated in beautiful Puerta
Vallarta. Rumor has it that Pena
went toa Disco. Aside from a few
problems, the trip was a success.
