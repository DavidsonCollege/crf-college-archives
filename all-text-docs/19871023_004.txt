Real Men will satisfy hedonistic pleasure-seekers

By BRUCE PLOURDE

Allow me to digress and make
my formal apology before I begin.
I wrote some movie reviews last
year for The Davidsonian under
the assumption that most readers
would have some semblance of
culture and would — dppreciate

ment of the men of the story, the .

real man who learns to love and
the meek man who learns not to
run from a fight. Like any great
comedy team, their personalities
conflict, producing humorous
friction.

Nick Pirandello (Jamey Be-

around in the impromptu fashion
of Chevy Chase.

Bob Wilson (John Ritter) has
an “average, maybe less” life,
with a secure job as an insurance”
salesman and a doting, simple
family. In this role Ritter recap-

“Tires the likeable wimpishness of

some of the finer aspects of
cinema. However, having read
one or two reviews this year I find
that, for many, I was citing
Chaucer where Mother Goose was
called for. Some of you are count-
ing on three ingredients in a
movie: dead bodies, car chases
and bare hooters. So in the interest
of attending to the expectations of
as many as possible, keeping with
the principles of representation for
all, and other such principles

which formed the living democ-

racy of this great country of ours, I

Shall in the future endeavor to

broaden my scope of attention:

Real Men is a decent parody of
spy movies, very similar to The
In-Laws yet more with an eye to-
ward the entire James Bond genre.
There aren’t many car chases, but
there are shootouts a-plenty; the
body count escalates at a steady
pace throughout, and there is one
bared hooter early on to attract at-
tention. There’s even a bar called
“Big Ed’s. cocktails.” From that
encapsulation one would assume
correctly that, though the movie
manages to satirize all that makes
spy flicks great, it caters more to
fun than intellectual humor.

The plot of the film is a neglig-
ible nuisance and interferes very
little. The movie concentrates
largely on the character develop-

lushi), the “clich-killer,” receives
his assignment from CIA héad-
quarters; retrieve the stolen map
and arrange to meet the UFOs at
the predetermined place and time.
He must negotiate with them, hav-
ing two options. He can accept the
“good package” which will save
all life on earth from a fatally toxic
chemical spill. Or, he can ask for
the “big gun,” a;weapon so power-
ful it will blow away an entire
planet. Their price — a glass of
water, and he takes his choice.
The CIA, in the interests of na-
tional defense, wants the big gun.

At first a hard-core company
man, Nick eventually develops
misgivings about the mission and
the misplaced values of his
agency. Despite his disillusion-
ment he can still dodge bullets
from twenty gunmen while stand-
ing in the open and outgun every
last one of them. He needs no spe-
cial weapons; he invents them as
he needed. Who, indeed, but Nick
Pirandello ‘can piece together a
nail-shooting machine gun with
vacuum parts and a band-aid box,
except maybe James Bond? His
Bob Hope nose and John Belushi
eyebrows endow him well as a
comic actor. Fortunately he also
has some of his brother’s talent,
and takes advantage of the script’s
occasional opportunities to clown

Jack “Fripper/in “Three’s Com-
pany.” He is a man of resolutely
firm: jelly. He doesn’t take being
pushed around without appropri-
ately falling down. In comparison
to Nick, he is not a “real man.”
His only quality of interest to the
CIA is his resemblance to a key
scientist who is killed by an assas-
sin. He is conscripted (kidnapped,
really) by Nick into the service of
his country. Thus begins Bob’s
transition from innocence to ex-
perience. His coming of age re-

sults in anguishing trials and
crises which, when taken in their
silly context, are quite funny.

Finding himself the protege of
a madman, he takes every oppor-
tunity to escape and disassociate
himself from Nick, but learns that
he has only two choices, Nick or
the mob of assassins who con-
stantly shoot at them. Bob can’t
seem to understand why these as-
sassins won't listen to sense.
When he learns the importance of
the mission, the impending doom
to “all the trees, all the birdies,
and all the children,” he takes re-
sponsibility and, under his men-
tor’s influence, gradually comes
to realize what it takes to become a
man of integrity and grit. He
realizes that, after all, a little vio-
lence never hurt anybody, espe-

cially criminals. Tempering

communication

By FRANK LORD

From the start, it is important
to understand that writing a re-
view of Ingmar Bergman’s The Si-
lence is something of a paradox,
or, at least, a contradiction in
terms. You see, the central theme
of The Silence is communication
or, rather, the impossibility of true
communication in the modern
world. Thus, I am here to com-
municate with you about a film
that essentially denies the possi-
bility of communication. Get the
picture?

The plot — if you can call ita
plot in the traditional sense — re-
volves around two sisters, one of
whom has her son with her. They
are staying in a hotel somewhere
in Europe during World War II.
The link that keeps the two
women together is that they are
lovers. wet j5.5)

Their relationship:serves as a
premise for the erotic images that
appear continually in the film.
However, in the context of the
film, these images become sterile.
Eventually, contrary to what you
might expect, these sometimes
graphic depictions of sex lose any
meaning that they might have had
for us becoming, in the process, a
metaphor for the lack of under-
standing that each character has
for the others. As one of the sisters
says to a male lover, “How nice it
is that we don’t understand each
other.”

In fact, the film is held to-
gether by metaphors for human
misunderstanding. Besides the
metaphor of sex, there are two
others that are equally central to
the film: the war and the language.

The war plays only an inter-
mittent part in the film. It is
neither frequently discussed, nor
adequately explained. This leads
to a sort of disorientation in the
viewer which is precisely what
Bergman wants. By leaving out
whatever relationship there might
be between the main characters
and the war, Bergman tells the au-
dience that the characters them-
selves don’t understand it, and
since the viewer does not know
anything about the war, neither
does he. Thus, the viewer is as lost
as the characters in a sea of non-

“comprehension.

Like the war, language is used
to confuse the viewer. The diso-

rienting affects of the language in’

the film are intentional. Continu-
ally, the two sisters are unable to
communicate with those around
them because they do not speak
the same language. In the subti-
tled version -of the ‘original

Swedish, most of the speeches in
Swedish are subtitled, but none of
the speeches by characters who

speak other languages are. —
This is not a_ mistake.
Bergman’s Swedish audience

would have been unable to under--
stand the parts of the film that are

in German, and he knew that. He

used their inability to comprehend

foreign languages to intensify’
their reaction to the sisters lack of

comprehension. The same affect

is achieved in the subtitled version

by leaving the speeches in Ger-

man unsubtitled. ne:

In all, what I have said may
not make much sense, but re-
member this: Bergman intention-
ally disorients his audience so that
they will be able to empathize
more clearly with the disorienta-
tion of the film’s three central
characters.

If Bergman had clearly
explained to the audience exactly

. what occurs in the film, it would

be even more incomprehensible
than it already is. This way, at
least, we understand that we are
not supposed to understand. For
those of us who are used to films
that are based on developments in
plot, this all seems a bit odd.

My suggestion is to suspend
your rationality for a little while.
This is a film that is meant to be
felt as it develops. After you have
seen the whole thing, you can at-
tempt to break it down into logical
parts, but to attempt to understand
it as the plot unfolds will only lead
to further confusion. (For those of
you who have not gotten it yet,
that is exactly what Bergman in-
tends.)

You should see this film, if _
only for the cinematography.
Sven Nykvist, who was
Bergman’s photographer for
many years, does an absolutely
amazing job in this film. Without
a doubt, this is some of the most
incredible black and _ white
cinematography that I have ever
seen.

Ultimately, this film will be,
for those of you that see it, a new
experience. don’t shy away from
it because of that. If nothing else,
you'll see something that could
never have come out of the hype
factories of Hollywood, and that
can’t be all bad.

_ This week's Cinema Classic,
The Silence, will be showing
Saturday and Sunday nights at 8
p.m. in Love Auditorium.
