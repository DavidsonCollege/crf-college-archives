Our Sterile Uproar

For a number of years the students
have agitated, talked and written of in-
creased athletic subsidy. It is not ques-
tioned in this editorial whether or not
this student ferment was right or not.
Perhaps the proposed program of non-
subsidy is good. What is questioned is
why the Davidson student is never even
heard in what he says, not just about
athletics, but about cuts, or vespers and
chapel, or YMCA membership, or any-
thing else from library hours to the ex-
tended duration of the chapel bell’s off-
tone knell.

The Davidsonien, “The news and edi-
torial voice of the college,” is recognized
by those who work for it as a free press
independent of close supervision and able
to support anything that is within the
bounds of good taste and reasgn. We hope
that we are not transgressing the bounds
of taste and reason when we ask why the
Davidsonian shouldn’t be free, for it is
like every other student or student or-
gan, a voice crying in the wilderness like
a hound dog, and, from all the action it
spawns, respected just about as much as
its type in the canine world.

Much have we heard during this and
past years of our student generation of
how the students and the administration
have failed to see eye to eye on most is-
sues, of how there has inevitably been an-
tagonism on most issues, whether they
be local ones, such as the question of Col-
lege Union feeding of freshmen, or wid-
er ones such as the athletic policy.

It is not for no reason that there has
been so much dissatisfaction among stu-
dents here. We have felt ourselves in a
hopeless position, and none is more able
to feel this hopelessness than one in
charge of an organ of communication such
as the campus paper. For he is able to
see his words go down, congratulated or
castigated, and then politely forgotten
forever, to be dug up only by curio hunt.
ers in future years.

But more than this, he comes to rea-
lize that what the paper must print are
simply club meetings and current events,
for nothing ever reaches his hands that
is formative of the policy of the College,
or at least not before it reaches the news-
papers or is so violently rumored that
something must be said with regard to
it. It is a feeling of hopelessness beyond
measure, and also a feeling of ‘helpless-
ness and unimportance, as the student
pictures himself unimportant to the life
of leviathan, and therefore conceals him-
self in a shell of cynicism, or worse, ceas-
es to care what he does to or for the in-
stitution that is giving him his college ed-
ucation. It is a situation that is worse than
being opposed—many have said that the
closest thing to hell is to be given no at-
tention whatsoever. We're closing in.

Now, lest we be accused of accusing
somebody of something, let us make this
clear: we have tried here to expose a
problem that we believe is basic to our sit-
uation, but which is the fault of no one.
There is simply a lack of cooperation and
communication on the part of the ele-
ments of this institution which must be
solved before any constructive work will
ever be done.

Dr. Cunningham has realized this,
and has this year had close connection
with leaders in the student body in trying
to iron out common problems. It was from
the president that we “rst learned of the
Ivy League proposals regarding David.
son football. Omicron Delta Kappa has
realized the problem, and has served this
year as a ground upon which students and
faculty could iron out and discuss com-
mon problems to all members of the insti-
tution, such as conduct, athletics, and the
drinking rule. There have been student-
faculty committees in the past for simi-
lar purposes. Dean Spencer has arranged
regular dinner meetings with the David-
sonian Staff to discuss issues of Davidson,
and the staff has profited greatly by this
close contact with the administration. But
none of these can answer the basic need.

Organizations can talk out problems
from here to eternity, but until there

comes to the students of this campus a be-
lief that the presentation of their views,
whether it be through the Davidsonian,
ODK, student body meetings, or what
have you is being considered and acted
upon by the trustees of the college there
will never be any cooperation here.

The students are neither idiots nor
proletarians, but thinking young. people,
no matter how much their. actions seem
at times to disprove this statement. And
each time they vote one way, as in the
case of football subsidy, and find the
trustee decision going the other way with-
out hearing an explanation with regard
to their interests instead of the quality
of Ivy League scholarship or something
more nebulous, then they will rebel. And
this rebellion will be stopped neither by
editorials in the newspaper nor conces-
sions on the part of the administration.

Will we be heard, or do we cry in the
wilderness? .

It was late October of 1951 that Nat
Daniel, columnist for the Davidsonian,
began the annual round of athletic dis-
satisfaction with a contribution entitled
“Fifty Futile Football Years, Or What
Price Moral Victory.” On the sports page
the next week football held the sports
headlines, and pictures of three David-
son standouts decorated the columns.
Everyone knew by that time that it would
be another fall of defeat, but not every-
one knew that within the year the foot-
ball coach would leave his post, Davidson
would fight with itself over the problem
of subsidization, and finally that the col-
lege would begin a program of small-
scale building which this year turned up
moderately successful.

Daniel seemed to set the cue for the
year when he said “. . . but despite her
seconds and minutes of glory, from the
first to last whistle, Davidson has always
been a medium-sized college with
medium-sized faculties, paying medium-
sized coach’s salaries, but due to pressure
from defeat-forgetting alumni and many
other influences, still sticking her neck
into big-time football, and more often
than not getting her head chopped off
—and so it has been, with few exceptions,
since 1900. The question is then, Can
Davidson play big-time football?”

Later in the first semester a poll was
taken in chapel which asked the same
questions that were asked to students of
Davidson this week, i.e., Are you in favor
of the present athletic program at David-
son?, Are you in favor of deemphasizing
athletic subsidization at Davidson?, Are
you in favor of further emphasizing ath-
letic subsidies at Davidson? Though less
than half the student body registered
opinions, the results were indicative of
the attitude in a year very similar to
this one. 16.2% were in favor of the
present system. 26.5% were in favor of
deemphasizing athletic subsidization.
57:3% were in favor of more subsidy.
Three years have brought more subsidi-
zation, and as a result, we believe, the
change in student opinion recorded by
the Morehead poll of this week.

So for years—not just three—the
opinion of the Davidson College student
body, purported integral to the College,
has been for increased subsidy. The
Davidson student has wanted, we might
say, big-time football here. And what has
he received?

The following is quoted from the min-
utes of the Board of Trustees, May 28,
1954: “We recommend to the Trustees
that we authorize the President of the
College to solicit and encourage a select-
ed group of at least six colleges and
universities to join with us in promoting
a program looking toward the abolishing
of subsidized athletics (that is athletic
scholarships as such) at the earliest pos-
sible date.”

Here, we believe, is presented in stark
relief the one thing which contributes
more than any other to the bitterness
on the part of the student body at David-
son. Here is the root of the accusation
that Davidson is nothing more than a
prep school, a college eternally paternal.

Subsidy: To Play As Equals But To Maintain Standards

BY CHARLIE COUSAR

Perhaps you had the same ex-
perience I had this summer. One
morning you picked up our local
newspaper to find an obscure no-
tice tucked away on the second
page of the sports section to the
effect that Davidson might pos-
sibly follow Washington and Lee
in taking a non-subsidy view tow-
ard athletics. The article went on
to say that the Board of Trustees
had granted President Cunningham
the authority to investigate the

* possibility of forming a confer-

ence of probably six teams in
which no athletic scholarships
would be given.

Since that time no formal state-
ment has been given as to the
progress made in forming such a
conference. Whether negotiations
have been successful or whether
the whole matter has fallen
through is a complete mystery to
the students and to many of the
faculty members too. However, the
time seems ripe for the students
to voice their opinion for or

against any movement toward non-
subsidization or any other change
they might wish to see in David-
son's athletic future.

Student Opinion Poll

This week’s Davideonien carries
a poll taken by members of the
Devidsonten staff in regard to ath-
lettcs here. Three arbitrary pos-
sibilities were set up about which
students could express their opin-
ion. The results of this poll show
that there is a definite feeling
among the student body toward a
policy of subsidization. The fact
that such an overwhelmingly large
per cent of the students voted for
subsidization of some kind, either
as we have it now or increased,
certainly should carry gorhe weight
with the Board of Trustees or the
President or whoever finally de-
cides the issue.

If athletics are primarily for the
students, then why shouldn't the
students have some part in de-
termining the school’s policy? Or
is it true that until now there has

never been any policy as such
and that one needs to be formu-
lated?

There are certainly strong argu-
ments in favor of Davidson’s hav-
ing a solid athictic program. By
solid, I mean participation with
Southern Conference teams such
as William and Mary, Furman,
George Washington, V. M. 1, The
Citadel, and Richmond. This would
not be limited to football alone
but would include basketball, golf,
swimming, and the other sports
which the college now promotes.

And I believe Davidson could
maintain such a program success-
fully. For football, it would take
only an increase of $5,000 to
$10,000 to push us up into the
level, athletically, of the teams
mentioned above. A similar in-
crease in basketball would give us
the necessary boost. Perhaps a golf
and a tennis scholarship could be
added too.

High Scholastic Standards

Such an improved program would
also mean that the scholastic

Due To Lack Of Understandin

standards would not have to be
lowered at all. High school ath-
letes would be screened thorough-
ly, as prospective football players
are now, to be certain that they
were capable of doing college
work. Certainly no one wants
Davidson to be loaded down with
a bunch of tramp athletes who
have to sign their checks with Xs.
But the chances of this taking
place are nil with the selection

and screening that goes on now.

The teams in one respect could
be like last year’s football team—
above the all men’s average.
Each year there are dozens of
high school graduates in this sec-
tion of the country who are fine
athletes and who are capable of
becoming student leaders at David-
son who by-pass the college be-
cause they are offered scholar-
ships elsewhere. Any number of
students could name one of the
top tennis players in the Caro-
linas who was interested in com:
ing to Davidson three years ago
and who successfully met each of

the requirements for admission,
But now he is making a name for
himself at one of our nearby
schools for obvious reasons. Why
cannot Davidson put itself out a
little bit and reach more of the
boys who fall in this category, who
are interested in getting an edu.
cation as well as Participating in
college athletes. Perhaps many of
us know boys from our own home.
town who have had this experi.
ence.

It would be folly to try to enu.
merate in such a short space all
the advantages of a good inter.
college athletics. Perhaps many of
fact that school spirit would be
bolstered, that many more boys
would have an opportunity to
come to college, and that the name
of Davidson would be bettered in
the public’s eyes are just a few.
Why does not Davidson take this
advantage to improve itself and to
present a better and a more at.
tractive program?

Why Bring Christ

Into Christmas?

BY GILBERT GRAGG

“Everybody seems to be trying
to get in on the Christmas bo-
nanza” commented a sophisticated
twentieth-century American after
seeing Santa with a cocktail’ glass
in a liquor advertisement. “Why
the next thing you know the
churches will try to climb aboard
the holiday bandwagen!”

In this materialistic age of as-
pirins, aperitifs, and atoms there
is no reason, however, for the
church or any of us to be concerned
about the birth of the Bethlehem
Babe for our lives. Let's be realis-
tie about it!

Students at Christmas

Christmas for us means eagerly
awaited holidays, gala parties, get-
ting gifts we do not need, eggnog,
etc... . There will be no time for
genuine self-analysis in our fran-
tie search for pleasure to re-orient
our lives around that of the Naz-
arene.

We are too intelligent and so-
phisticated (after all, we are at
Davidson) to take seriously a poor

Students Manifest Apathy To Gift Fund

By TOMMY THOMPSON

A familiar rumble of laughter
terminated last week’s unsatisfac-
tory clarification of the Gift Fund
project. As everyone slowly filed
out of chapel, I realized that the
daughter was not the result of the

, usual cynicism, boredom, rude-

ness, or even humor, but that the
chuckles were justified. Who
would not manifest his awe orally
at the declaration of giving $4,000
to a mirage? No other action could
be expected when this mirage is
merely defined as some Christians
teaching some uneducated Greek
peasants how to farm. Does it take
$4,000 to teach a man to dig a
hole and plant a seed in it?

Unfortunately, however, the task
of the Christian team in Greece
is a little more complicated and
tedious than we have been told.

,Having worked this summer in

Mexico for a similar basic educa-
tional team as the one in Greece,

Book, Magazine
Committee Praised

Have you been in the College
Union lately to see the brilliant
display of books which grace each
side of the spacious fireplace with
its crinkled copper covering? This
striking array of literature is the
inspired work of Messrs. Gilbert
Gragg,, Bob Brown, Joe Conarroe,
and Frank White, nfembers of the
Book and Magazine Committee
(known to their intimate friends
as the B & M Committee).

These gentlemen are to be es-
pecially commended for their re-
grouping of books. Formerly, lit-
erature of various types was
thrown together with no obvious
consideration of subject matter.
Now, however, books are logical-
ly grouped, as can be illustrated
by the fact that This Was Cicero
is placed directly next to Our
Medern Money end Banking Sys
tom.

May the corporate Davidson fam-
ily congratulate each member of
the B & M Committee for a job
well done!—John Harmon

I feel compelled to attempt to ex-
pose summarily for the reader the
pressing reality of an otherwise
indistinguishable dream.

The area of work far exceeds
teaching people modern methods
of agriculture and animal disease
control to replace their prevalent,
primitive customs. These back-
ward people know nothing about
basic sanitation in regions where
their bathroom is the backyard and
their stove is a hole in the ground.

. Disease runs rampant, particularly

among the young children, most
of whom hardly survive infancy,
Bodies are weak not only because
there is a limited food supply and
disease is prevalent but also be-
cause recreation is foreign to them.
In their spare time they waste
away in idleness not knowing even
simple games, not to mention ab-
solute lack of materials and facili-
ties for recreation. Adding still
another problem, there are few
schdols in the rural, improverish-

ed districts where the team
works, in which the people can
learn to help themselves.

How difficult it is for us who
live in the blessings of plenty to
conceive that the above conditions
exist in our world today. Further-
more, the people abiding in such
depravation are unwittingly apa-
thetic. Not ever having any better
state in which to live, they do not
know or want any better. Such in-
difference is dissolved only when
hew ideas and attitudes are ab-
sorbed by them. Thus, with the aim
of instilling within the people a
desire to help themselves, the
team furnishes some of the mater-
jails, teaches them orally, and
works alongside of them as a
peer. Accomplishment and success
appear only when in confidence the
people begin to feel the necessity
of solving their problems by using
their own initiative and resources.

The glaring need and possible
range of work is evident to us.

Our gift can be used to procure

more materials for the team and

more teams for Greece. It is not a

quick or easy process to stamp

out poverty, disease, and illiteracy.

Yet our small personal donations

can turther the cause of Chris-

tianity in a tangible and practical

manner as well as prove to the

world that we, as Americans, cre

striving for world peace by assist-

ing our foreign neighbors in their

fundamental needs. Bonaro Over-

street has said:

“You say the little efforts that I
make will do no good

They will never prevail

To tip the hovering scale

Where justice hangs in balance

I don't think I ever thought they
would

But I am prejudiced beyond de-
bate

In favor of my right to choose
which side

Shall feel the stubborn ounces of
my weight.”

THE EDITOR’S MAILBOX

On ROTC Publicity

Sir:

How dare you lett that real bad
letter about our ROtC be publised
last week. Sinse I have been at
Davidson it has done more for
me thafi any other brineh af activi
ty and I have also been in PT so I
should know dont you think. Our
Tuesday afternoon marches have
built up my thies and calfs and
every tuesday when i am finished
I feel real good and ready to study
again as soon as I have had a good
supper and also ROTC classes gives
me a lot of knowledge about the
real importent things that I should
know about if I ever have to fight
for a wer and so dont you see that
I have a pretty good reason for not
wanting to want to read The David.
sonen any more after this anyhow.
The men at the Rotc dept. are do-
ing real good this year already and
I know that most of the students
are intrested in their articals in

the paper. So please continue to
print them and i will keep right on
reading them every time you come
out on Fridey nite. (SIC)

‘On Janitors®- Salaries

Dear Editor,

I saw in the New York Times re-
cently a rundown of New York's
Hundred Neediest Cases. Since the
Christmas season approaches 1
think it is time for the students

here to consider Davidson's need- .

fest cases. The majority of them
fall into one category: they are the
hired help of the college, and es-
pecially the janitors. Our Presby.
terian institution is said to under.
pay its faculty, but I believe that
the janitors may be said to break
some sort of record with their
weekly wage of about $30.00 (Plus
social security, Blue Cross, and a
coal discount, of course). At that

wage our college has fulfilled the
truly Calvanistic code of frugality
and industry: our janitors must
not only save what they have, but
their whole families must work
also to keep food coming in. I don't
want to intimate that they should
be paid more. After all, the College
knows best. But I do think that
the students should save a dollar
or two out of the hamburger
money and give it to the janitors
so they and their wives can cele-
brate Christmas with the rest of
us on December 25,

Sincerely,

Bill Evans

Church At Christmas

In a great many of our churches
Christ’s incarnation makes little
difference. Many ministers, it
seems, have recognized that we
live to please ourselves and are
never happier than when self-sat-
isfaction comes—thus they tell us
what we want to hear, and salva-
tion becomes a mental peace of
raind. We want Christianity te show
us how to be financially successtul,
well-adjusted, end contented es the
proverbiel cow. What room does
this leave for the suffering and
sword Christ brought? Dostoevski
was right in stating that the Church
would reject Christ if- He came
again?

Toynbee’s concluding litany in
his Study of History merely men-
tions Christ along with other
saintly figures through the ages
instead of proclaiming that his di-
vinity makes him the end of all
religious seeking—thus if the
child in the manger had never
been born it would have made no
difference since we have several
other splendid moral teachers to
guide our lives. Anyway the thee
logical trend now is for “univer-
sal salvation,” so feith In Christ
es the son of Ged Is not necessary.

Our church has no
Place for Christ when he advised
us to lose our lives; we are trying
frantically every way we know to
find them!

Epilogue

While writing this I have been
listening to a program of Chfist-
mas music on the radio — “All I
Want for Christmas are my two
front teeth,” “I Saw Momma Kiss-
ing Santa Claus,” “Blue Christ-
mas,” “Silver Bells” and now
Eartha Kitt is enticingly cooing
forth with “Santa Baby.”

Wouldn't it be much mere ap
propriate to celebrate Christmes
on Good Friday?
