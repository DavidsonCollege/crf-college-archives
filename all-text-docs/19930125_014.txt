Tampa squad that unfortunately
never happened as a result of a no-

that, the team was able to train hard
and the trip ended up being very
beneficial. The team had home
meets on January 16 and 17 against
College of Charleston and the Uni-
versity of Richmond. Even though
the team lost both meets, the com-
petition was tough and the team’s
improvement was obviousas times

continued to drop.

The Wildcats stepped back
into Southern Conference play in
Cullowhee January 6 in need of
confidence after the UNCC de-
bacle. Behind 64% shooting and a
career-high 22 points from senior
J.D. Heuer, they got it. Seemingly
ready to pull away permanently
with a 12-point lead midway
through the second half, Davidson
withstood a Catamount run that
brought them within 71-69 with
2:32 to play. Musch, Narat,
Zimmerman, Alpert and Heuer
combined to hit 10 of 10 foul shots
over the last 1:44 to lock up the
win.

Furman 80

Davidson 73,

With dreadful (22%) first half
shooting January 9 in Greenville,
the ‘Cats fell behind 23 points to
the Paladins, then launched an as-
tonishing comeback. From Narat’s
three-pointer to beat the first half

. buzzertoBrandon Williams’ three-

pointer with 8:16toplay, Davidson
outscored Furman 41-16 to take a
64-62 lead. But the icy shooting
touch reappeared for the latter
stages of the game, and the Pala-
dins escaped with the win.
Zimmerman had 16 points and Wil-
liams 14.

N.C. State 63

Davidson’ 58

Againsta struggling N.C. State
team down to nine players January

11 at Belk Arena, Davidson’s 11-
year long losing streak against ACC
competition seemed ripe for termi-
nation, particularly when the “Cats
took a 53-52 lead on Narat’s three-
pointer with 4:07 left. But State’s
Mark Davis responded witha three
of his own and the Pack hung on to

‘win. Musch had 16, Heuer 15 and

Narat 14 for Davidson (4-5). The
game was the team’s first without
junior Ron Horton, who tore knee
ligaments in practice and is lost for
the year; it is his third straight
season-ending injury.

East Tennessee State 75

Davidson 67

By taking ETSU, winner of
the last four Southern Conference
titles and last year a first round
victor -in the NCAA Tournament
over Arizona, to the wire before
losing in Johnson City, Tn., the
‘Cats earned some respect in the
conference. Davidson (4-6, 1-2)
got to within 64-60 on Alpert’s
two free throwsat4:50,butcouldn’t
convert down the stretch. Said
coach Bob McKillop, “I'd like to
see less good VMI surge and sent
Davidson (6-7, 3-3). to the easy
win. All 14 Wildcats played, in-
cluding senior co-captain Matt
Matheny, whose free throw. at :28
touched off the Steak and Hoagie
Offensive Explosion. Musch
scored 16, Zimmerman 15 and
Heuer 14.
