Fraternity Court Up To Students

After several months of fact-finding
sessions, the Student-Faculty Committee
on Fraternities has released this week
for airing before the Student Body the
various possibilities for construction of
a new fraternity court.

The questions which immediately
arise are numerous and complicated, and
are ones which the Student Body will
need to consider intelligently and care-
fully in the next few weeks.

While Davidson boasts at present a
campus and physical plant which would
compare favorably with any similar in-
stitution in this part of the country, the
most glaring deficiency still remaining
is in the area of fraternity housing.

The fraternity court now in use was
built in 1928, and has in the years since
its construction served an extremely use-
ful and valuable purpose. But in 1928,
fraternity memberships averaged around
32 men, with the largest around 40 mem-
bers, while today as many as 80 men
crowd into a single house. The old court
is obviously outmoded.

Even more sub-standard and unsatis-
factory, in all but a few instances, are
the fraternity boarding houses. Confined
almost entirely to private homes whose
vintage is of another generation, their
facilities are no longer adequate for the
demands made upon them. Many are
bulging at the seams, and in some cases
could not seat another man.

In the face of rising enrollments in
the immediate future, this situation in
both houses and boarding houses will be
further intensified. While part of the
answer lies in bringing one or two addi-
tional fraternities to. the campus, new
facilities for all the groups are a must to
deal realistically with the problem.

Both students and Administration
have recognized this fact for some time,
and have sought to find an acceptable
and workable solution. The possibilities
released this week represent this at-

tempt.

It cannot be emphasized too strongly
that as far as the Administration is con-
cerned, this is a matter for the students
to decide. The College officials have
merely done fhe investigating necessary
to determine what is possible and what
is not. Their attitude seems to be that if
student opinion is favorable, the move
can probably be arranged. The College
would not consider taking any action on
this matter which the fraternities did not
wholeheartedly endorse.

An outline of the discussion revol-
ving around single houses versus duplex
units and the considerations arising
therefrom is carried in the accompanying
news columns, and we will not attempt
to analyze them here until further study
is possible.

While everyone agrees that single,
separate units are preferable, it appears
now that they may be financially unfeasi-
ble, especially for the smaller fraterni-
ties. Qn the other hand, duplex units
seem well within the realm of possibility,
and at a substantial reduction in cost
from the single houses.

While the advantages of the single
unit are undeniable, our. first impression
is that should they prove out of reach,
the natural objections to the duplex plan
are far from being prohibitive, and could
be satisfactorily reconciled,

At any rate, as opinion gradually
solidifies it is important that we realize
that either plan would be an immense
and badly needed improvement over the
present set-up. If the single unit plan
is found to be impossible, it would be
unfortunate to by-pass the duplexes, sim-
ply because they are not completely ideal
in every respect.

The improvement over the present
situation represented in either of the al-
ternatives is something which should not
be allowed to hang on controversy in-
volving which choice to make.

Coercion-A Dangerous Precedent

For the third time in the memory of
the senior class, the fabulous Louis
“Satchmo” Armstrong put on a show at
Davidson. And, whether one enjoys his
music or not, there is no denying that

Sequel: This Time
No Reprieve

Only the members of the senior class
still remain of a student body which a
little over four years ago awoke one
morning and was shocked to learn how
during the night a stealthy bandit had
sacked the dormitories to the tune of
several hundred dollars and assorted
pieces of jewelry.

Little did they know what vicious
manner of man had leisurely and almost
nonchalantly roamed the dormitory
rooms so quietly that night.

Jennings Fields died for his crime in
the electric chair in Reidsville, Georgia
last Tuesday after a suicide attempt. One
of these crimes was the murder of a
policeman with the officer’s own pistol
during the course of his subsequent ar-
rest in Georgia four years ago.

In his last. hours, Fields slashed his
wrists, had them sewn up, then opened
a cut in the lip of one of the five guards
required to put him in the chair.

After a fantastic number of previous
last-minute stays from execution, the vio-
lent end finally came. This time there
was no reprieve.

an Armstrong concert is.a production.

The fact is that, with the program
scheduled for Wednesday night, many
people either could not attend because of
other activities or because they felt hav-
ing seen one or two Armstrong presenta-
tions was enough. ,

This is why so much comment was
stirred up when the student body was
frankly told in chapel on Tuesday that
they would either pay and go to the con-
cert or pay later and not get to see him.
In other words, students were coerced
into something outside the usual pale of
school loyalty.

This year’s IFC has made a fine con-
tribution to student life in its area and,
by accepting responsibility as it did dur-
ing “Hell Week”, is due our gratitude.

Before it launched into this Arm-
strong project, it took a straw vote
among the fraternities and 10 of the 11
said they would support the concert. It
was evident then, however, that opinion
was far from unanimous. Armstrong was
something of a risk.

When it became evident that the ad-
vance ticket sale indicated poor attend-
ance, the IFC felt something had to be
done.

The feeling is that forcing the stu-
dent body to attend and pay for an event
superfluous to the usual school year’s
activities is a dangerous precedent. In
the future, if such programs are going
to be offered, 2 more certain method of
determining student desires and ascer-
taining that those who ask for it support
it must be found.—F.L.H.

The amendment now before the
Student Body, to remove Consti-
tutional restrictions on student
elections has generated much
campus discussion and thought.

This amendment, as it now
stands, is not feasible because the
dangers inherent in it are much
greater than any good which could
be derived from it. The amend-
ment, authored by Creighton
Peden, leaves too much power of
discretion in the hands of the

Three Steps Offered As Compromise On Campaigns

Elections Board which would, un-
der Peden’s plan, have almost no
Constitutional guide for its
actions. There is also the possibil-
ity or even the probability that
the proposed change would bring
bitter political rivalry between
student factions, particularly fra-
ternities. This is a facet of politics
which the Davidson campus can
well do without.

Despite these faults, the amend-
ment and its author have done
the Student Body a service by

making us more conscious of real
weaknesses in our election system.
Most Davidsonians seem to feel
that there is too little genuine in-
terest in elections here on cam-
pus, which results in little inte-
rest in student government.

They also realize that under the
present system candidates have
little or no way to express their
views to the Student Body, which
in turn has no satisfactory method
for finding out which candidates
are best qualified to serve as of-

Reader Wants Reply to Question
On Required Chapel and Vespers

Jear Editor:

I still wonder if our present
system of compulsory attendance
at chapel and vespers is the best
possible system. If someone
knows, I would appreciate hearing
why compulsory religious services
are better than voluntary religi-
ous services. Surely someone must
have an answer.

Last week I suggested with ap-
parently naive boldness that at-
tendance at chapel and vespers be
made voluntary. I do not know
whether this is the best step to
take. I would therefore appreciate
hearing some reasons why my pro-
posal is unsound. During the past
week here are three criticisms
which I have received:

Should Have Known

Some persons hold that a stu-
dent is naturally expected to sub-
mit to this compulsory attendance
because it is a part of the Da-
vidson program. A student is re-
sponsible for knowing about such
things before he comes to David-
son College. By enrolling here, he
admits that he realizes the situ-
ation and is willing to accept it.

Is this argument valid? Do stu-
dents who enter Davidson know
everything about compulsory re-
ligious services? Even if they
know that attendance is required,
it is only after that initial fresh-
man innocence has been exposed
to the situation that they really
realize all that is involved. If
an entering student learns that
a chapel service is required, he
expects to attend a chapel service,
not an assembly of students study-
ing, sleeping, and talking. He ex-
pects a vesper service, not a ses-
sion of letter-writing and sleeping.

Tradition

Others hold that attendance at
chapel and vespers is compulsory,
has been compulsory, and will al-
ways. be compulsory because it is
a part of the Davidson tradition.
I do think that many of the Da-

vidson traditions are fine and
have real meaning. Care must be
taken, however, not to sanctify
false ideas or mistaken concep-

_ tions with the white cloak of tra-

dition. We must not let something
become traditional merely for the
sake of being traditional. It is
also quite possible for some tra-
ditions to lose touch with the
times. Tradition is a powerful
force, but we must constantly
keep an eye out for where it is
going.

Need Break

In connection with chapel at-
tendance, a third group feels that
a compulsory chapel is a good
thing because it provides a need-

LITTLE MAN ON CAMPUS

ed break at 10:20. We have been
working hard for two hours, and
we therefore need to go to a com-
pulsory chapel program.

What is the connection between
compulsory attendance and the
need for a break in the routine?
If this break is desirable, there is
ro need for required chapel to fit
in this space. Possibly the people
who argue in this manner really
want a free period.

Some others believe that this
period is merely wasted time. They
would like to see a class period be
introduced here.

I am still looking for reasons
why chapel and vespers should
not be voluntary. I would appreci-
ate any answers,

ficers.

Keeping these problems in
mind, I propose that the Student
Council act to enable the Elections
Board to take these three steps
toward improving the present
situation:

(1) An open-forum type discus-
sion should be held in the Student
Union the night after the five can-
didates for Student Body Presi-
dent have spoken in Chapel. The
five should be given a chance to
discuss informally their platforms
with the members of the Student
Body, who in turn could ask the
candidates to state clearly their
views on any particular problem
or issue. The Election Board
should make every effort to see
that this meeting is well pub-
licized, and that it is fairly con-
ducted.

(2) Candidates should be al-
lowed to spend up to $25, if they
desire, on the printing of pamph-
lets, handbills, and other cam-
paign material so that they might

have an opportunity to state clear.
ly, in print, their platforms.

(3) The fraternities should be
asked by the Elections Board to
invite the five Presidential candi-
dates, in a group, to their re-
spective boarding houses for a
meal, either lunch or dinner. This
would give the candidates a
chance to become acquainted with
members of the Student Body who
do not know them, as well as a
chance to discuss informally, cur-
rent Student Body problems or
campaign issues.

All three of these proposals
would initially pertain only to
candidates for Student Body Pres-
ident. The program could be ex-
panded in later years as the op-
portunity shall arise.

The purpose of these proposals
is to meet what I feel to be a
definite need: more democratic
and more representative Student
Government on the Davidson cam-
pus.

STREET JOURNAL—,

The Helicopter Dollar

President Eisenhower will soon
start using a helicopter to get
from the White House to Wash-
ington National Airport. The Air
Force figures it can haul the
President between the two points
in three or four minutes. The trip
takes ten to twenty minutes by
limousine.

Well, we are strong for any-
thing that will save the President
—or anyone else for that matter
—the perils of driving through
modern traffic. The Air Force
says ‘whirly-bird travel is safer
than driving, and we are inclined
to agree that almost anything is
safer than driving.

Peter, the Practical Politician
had been nominated for president
of the student body, but he
couldn’t seem to get started on his
campaign speech.

If he said that the present stu-
dent government was bogged
down by inertia, he'd be criti-
cized for talking that way about
such nice guys.

i¢ the asked any serious
questions concerning the pur-
poses of student government,
the goals of student govern
ment, and the improvement
of student government, he
would be hooted down as oe
rabble-rouser and « demigo-
gue.

If he pointed out weaknesses in
the Honor System and the stu-
dent body regulations, he’d be
castigated for disloyalty to David-
son.

If he ran on a platform based
on Christian ethics, he'd be
labeled a “Holy Joe” and soundly
defeated.

tt he sald that he knew he
wes capable of doing a better
job than his opponents, end
would appreciate the opportu-
nity to prove it, he'd be
hanged in effigy for his con-
eeit, and ridden out of town
on a rail for his honesty.

Finally, he arrived at a solution,
and after a quick phone call to
a rich uncle who had an extra
$100,000 to spare, he began to
write: “As president of the stu-
dent body during the coming
year, I propose to solve two cru-
cial problems: First, I shall
guarantee that by next September,
the new dormitory will be appro-
priately named, and secondly, I
shall personally see to it that the
Woodrow Wilson acorns are
watered at least once a week when
it isn’t raining.”

D

It is nice, too, that the Presi-
dent can save time even if he is
having trouble saving the taxpay-
ers’ money. Which reminds us. If
the President were to step into
his helicopter, and take off
straight up for o flight over a
stack of silver dollars equal to the
$72 billion budget he has pro-
posed, he would have a flight of
something over 129,000 miles just
to reach top.

Of course, the heltcopter has
not yet been built that could fly
so high. But, perhaps, neither has
fhe taxpayer.

Something new has been added.
Workers in the student store are
now required to wear black bow
ties when on duty. May we sug-
gest tuxedos for the men behind
the desk, and a uniformed door-
man in the front, to indicate
which door is to be used by
visitors, and where students

We noted with interest the com-
ments by Mr. James Dabbs con-
cerning our remarks about Hell
Week which appeared in the Da-
vidsonian of two weeks ago. Mr.
Dabbs’ criticism of our position
on the grounds that it was un-
realistic is absolutely correct, but
we were not proposing a realistic
solution to the problem; we were
being intentionally idealistic.

One conclusion of an excessive-
ly idealistic conception of any hu-
man activity is that the ideal can-
not easily be achieved in actual
practice, and Hell Week is no ex-
ception.

For the benefit of Mr. Dabbs
and the many others who agreed
with him, we shall attempt to be
more realistic and more explicit.

Hell Week, as it is practiced at
most colleges, cannot develop
moral ‘strength very effectively,
and croker sacks, raw eggs,
scavenger hunts, etc., are some-
what inefficient methods of de-
veloping “esprit de corps, unity,
and belonging” in a group of
pledges.

May we suggest that Davidson's
fraternities seriously consider the
possibility of doing away with
Hell Week, and substitute in its
place more constructive methods
of unifying their pledge classes;
methods which might help them
to move toward emotional maturi-
ty and moral strength.
