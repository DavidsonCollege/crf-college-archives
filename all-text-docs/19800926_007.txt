Barnes said he came to
Davidson because, ‘‘I wanted
very much to teach. Having
gone to a school similar to
Davidson, I thought the atmo-
shere here would be an enjoy-
able one in which to teach.”

‘‘My first impressions of
Davidson have been very favor-
able’’ Barnes continued. ‘‘I like
the close relationship among
members of the faculty and
students.”

Richard Brubaker found out

is ‘‘very pleased with Davidson
as a whole.”

Pennance

Philip Pennance:
Mathematics

By JANE HARPER
Staff Carrespondent

New to the math department
is Philip Pennance, who comes
to Davidson after completing
graduate work at the University
of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill.

Pennance, a citizen of En-
gland, graduated there from
Hull University. He earned his
M.A.. from Leed University
before beginning work in a
radar factory.

Before coming to America,
Pennance taught for two years
at the University of Liberia in
Monrovia and for three years at
Cuttington University, also in
Liberia.

Pennance said that -he likes
the close contact with the
student body that the smallness
of Davidson allows. When
asked to compare the Univer-
sity system of America to that
of England, he. said that, al-
though quite different, both
systems have their good points.

Pennance enjoys the classical —

guitar and playing chess, while
not working. He also is study-
ing Spanish.

Kennedy

Robert Kennedy:
Psychology

By JAY NORMAN
Staff Correspondent

As a high school senior in
New Jersey, Robert Kennedy
was forced to choose between
Davidson and Holy Cross,
eventually selecting the latter.
Nevertheless, Davidson has fi-
nally succeeded. in bringing
Kennedy to the campus to teach
psychology.

At Holy Cross, Kennedy
received his English degree.
Four years later he entered
Penn State, where he earned a
Ph.D. in psychology. He then
taught at the University of
Florida, where he was assistant
professor of criminal psycho-
logy.

Kennedy has a permanent
appointment to teach psycho-
logy here at Davidson. He
hopes to remain here for several
years both teaching and doing
research on his own in the fields
of criminal psychology and
psychopathology .

One of the reasons Kennedy
came to Davidson was in hopes
that he would be able to do
further research, especially in
the fields of criminal psycho-
logy and psychopathology.
Kennedy believes that with
access to the Broughton Hos-
pital and nearby Charlotte he
will be able to utilize ‘‘real world
situations” for his research (he
claims that he is not referring to
Davidson students for psycho-
pathology reseach). Beginning
this June he also hopes to head
the Davidson summer program
at Broughton.

The move to Davidson was
indeed a new experience for
Kennedy. ‘‘After having lived
in New York and having attend-
ed large universities, Davidson
will be a welcomed change.”’

Kennedy hopes not only to
pursue academic interests but
to also find time for some of the
other activities he enjoys
swimming, tennis, and litera-
ture.

Chnstopher Frost:
Classics

By DAVE EARNHARDT
Staff Correspondent

Christopher Frost first found
out about Davidson during his
college days at Wake Forest.
He came in contact with the
area five summers ago, when he
passed through on a bicycle
tour from Washington, D.C.
to Georgia.

Frost graduated from Wake
Forest, later receiving his Mas-
ter’s from Trinity College. He
studied classics at the Univers-
ity of Dublin and at Princeton,
finishing his Ph.D. at the
University of Cincinnati.

His pastimes include canoe-
ing, reading Greek, play pro-
duction, cooking, watching the
antics of his kitten, and biking.

Frost is responsible for the -

fledgling bicycle tour club here
on campus.

Frost said that one of the
impressions he got here was
that he was on an island, so to
speak, with a high degree of
culture and learning, surround-
ed by a sea of local culture and
people. He commented that
Davidson has the serenity of,
say, Oxford or Cambridge, and
is ideal for someone whose
major interest is teaching, rat-
her than researching.

Hess

Peter Hess:

Economics

By DAN VOORHIS
Staff Correspondent

Peter Hess joins the econom-
ics department for the next two
years as a temporary replace-
ment for Randy Kincaid.

(Kincaid is running for the
9th District seat in the U.S.
House of Representatives.)

Hess will be teaching three
sections of Introduction to Pol-
itical Economy and three mac-
roeconomics.

Originally from Florida, Hess
moved to Maine and received
his B.A. in economics at Bow-
doin College. Before returning
to the South Hess taught high
school math for three years. He
skipped his M.A. and is cur-
rently working toward a Ph.D.
at UNC at Chapel Hill. Hess
said he plans to reenter the job
market when he acquires his

Frost
Ph.D. He plans to stay in
academia and prefers a school
similar to Davidson.

Hess said he likes Davidson's
atmosphere and close proximity
to Chapel Hill. He is generally
impressed with the student
body, which he considers intell-
igent and hard-working.

Hess said he would like to
participate in intramural soccer
and baseball but that his Ph.D.
work and teaching duties are
currently occupying most of his
time. Hess played both sports
at Bowdoin.

Thornberry
Mary Thornberry:
Political Science

By FRANCES PALMER
Staff Correspondent

Mary Thornberry is yet a-
nother professor who came
home to the South when she
began work at Davidson.

Thornberry is originally from
Chattanooga, Tennessee, and
earned her undergraduate de-
gree at Duke University. She
taught for two years at the
University of Colorado at Co-
lorado Springs and for one year
at the University of Tennessee
at Chattanooga before obtain-
ing her Ph.D. at the University
of Michigan. She has held a
position at the University of
Arizona for the past five years.

The idea of a small co-ed
liberal arts school helped in
Thornberry’s decision to return
to the South. As a Presbyterian
she also likes the college's close
ties with the church.

Thus far. Thornberry has
found Davidson a friendly place
and likes the way professors
help ‘to make things happen”
for students.
