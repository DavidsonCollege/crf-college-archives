WRESTLING TEAM ‘ELECTS
CAPTAIN AND MANAGER

A few nights ago the wrestling team met
and elected Lindamood as their captain for
next year. It has been decided to make the
manager and captain’s job separate and Sel-
ser has been chosen as the manager next
year. He has already begun on the sche-
dule, and although no definite arrangements
have been made, there will be two or three
trips and about five meets on the campus.
An attempt will be made to get a match with
Ga, Tech. at Atlanta. Selser says that be-
sides having more matches next year there
will be better accomodations for practice al-
so. It is hoped that the Athletic Associa-
tion will see fit to install a regular wrest-
ling mat in better quarters on the main floor
of the gym.

The manager and captain are both looking
forward to a strong team in 1924. Kimsey
is the only letter man that will not be back.
Lindamood is only a Freshman this year but
the fact that he was elected captain shows
the confidence that his teammates have in
his ability. Selser is a new man at David-
son also but has already shown his capabil-
ity as a lightweight

Four D's were given this year to Linda-
mood,-Selser, Cromartie and Kimsey, which
shows that interest in wrestling is growing
fast. The present manager is working hard
on the new schedule and he intends to do all
he can to put wrestling on a par with other
athletics,

ATHLETICS

Uniform “D”? Adopted for Four

Sports, Football, Baseball,
Basketball and Track.

A recent meeting of the Athletic Council
brought forth several changes in the rating
of letter men, as well as news of interest in
Tennis and Wrestling.

In the first place, it was voted to standard-
ize the size and design of letters to be award-
ed in the four major sports—Football, Bas-
ketball, Baseball, and Track. Heretofore
the Football letter men have been the only
D men who were allowed to wear the reg-
ulation eight inch block letter. Now, every
man who wins the coveted honor in the
other three sports of first rating, has the
same privilege of displaying a full size let-
ter of eight inches.

There was much discussion as to whether
the Wrestling team and the Tennis team
would be allowed this same standard D. The
discussion accomplished nothing, consequent-
ly a committee was appointed to work out
the proposition. This committee is headed
by Gig Shepherd and at the present time has
not reached a decision, however it is thought
that there will be a distinction between these
two forms of sports and the other four.

Another important incident in the meet-
ing was the decision to award letters to
four members of the past season’s wrestling
team. These men are, Pat Kimsey, Johnny
Selser, Captain Cromartie, and Harry Lind-
amood. ‘The whole team made a splendid
showing this year, especially against the V.
M. I. Cadets, the strongest team south of
the Mason-Dixon line.

After the decisions had been reached to
standardize the letters and award wrestling
letters, it was brought out that the plain,
ordinary certificate, that gives the privilege
to wear the D should be changed to some-
thing that would make a better appearance
and to something that could be framed. It
was decided to do this and to have a color
distinguishing each sport. The certificate
will probably be’ of sheepskin like a diploma.
These new certificates are to be sent out to
every old letter man of Davidson College
and from now on shall be given to any on
whom the much coveted D is conferred.

various athletic teams as nominees
Among those of the rising senior class who
wear the D and who were candidates for the
office of president were: Faison, Cox, Davis,
McBride, Clarke, Gallaway, Field, Boushlee,
Cromancie, DeArmand and Streibich.

The vice-president was chosen from the
letter men who are now in the rising junior
class, These were: Hendrix, Boggs, Mal-
lory, Beall, Hunt, Gracey, Staley, and Mc-
Comb. The only two letter men in the fresh-
man class were Laird and Lindamood. Laird
won over Lindamood on the first ballot.

Elias Faison is well fitted to guide the
destinies of the athletic association next
year. He expects a big year for Wildcat
athletics considering the fact that Monk
Younger will take charge next September
as head coach. With this attraction as a
means for drawing prep school athletes to
Davidson and plenty of men returning, Fai-
son says that he is sure of a successful year.

YOUNGER LOOKS OVER
NEXT YEAR’S MATERIAL

Monk Younger, who is to be head coach
of athletics at Davidson next year, was on
the hill Monday with the V. P. I. baseball
nine and while here talked over and com-
pleted his plans for the opening of the foot-
ball season next fall, Coach Younger is

|greatly pleased with the material on the

hill for the football squad. He was both
surprised and pleased to find many heavy
men in the student body and it is his wish
to have a large number of them in uniform
next fall.

Mr. S. D. Tilson is to be assistant coach
in football to Younger and will specialize
in coaching the line. He has had two years

jof valuable experience in that department

and knows the system well.

Arrangements are now being made for a
training table for the coming season and
doubtless this will be of great help to the
coaches in keeping the team in top notch
, condition.

Practically all of next year’s equipment
jhas arrived and with a good supply left from
last season, every man that goes out will be
given a good outfit.

Beginning this fall, no freshman will be

jallowed to play on the varsity. They will
| have their own squad, schedule and manager ;

and as coach they will have Rawson, of the
University of Georgia. This includes | all
three branches of freshman activities. Also
this is a new step in athletics at Davidson
for the Wildcats and needless to say, the

‘entire student body is behind the new coach-
}es in making their new work a success.

NICHES IN THE WILDCAT
HALL OF FAME

No. 15 JOHN PARRY LAIRD JR.
Football ‘ae

Basketball

The football season of 1916 has gone down
in the annals of Davidson athletics as one of
the most memorable in the history of the
institution and no small credit is due to the
work of “Johnnie” Laird, who was an in-
dlenenit ‘cog in the Wildcat aggregation
of that years The lightest backfield man on
the team, weighing only a scant 150
“Johnnie” could dart and twist through the
opposing lines’ with a wonderful facility

-

that was most discomforting to the heavy
elevens, that faced Davidson through the
three years that he played on the Varsity.
He was also a popular man on the campus,
being engaged in many forms of student
activities and movements.

Laird hailed from Decatur, Georgia, hav-
ing a brilliant prep school record behind
him at Tech High. At his first football
practice with the Wildcats under Coach Bill
Fetzer he gave excellent promise, being fleet
of foot and-able to handle the ball. His
three years on the Varsity under the tutor-
age of Coach Fetzer made him one of the
most versatile backs in Carolina football
circles and he ran up many points for the
Red and Black with his steady line playing
and passing. Laird showed his versatility
by playing end, half and fullback, filling
each position cqually well. He was espe-
cially adept at getting under punts and forc-
ing his way through the heaviest oposing
line. Davidson faced teams that outweigh-
ed her men many pounds to the man but
never once did the Wildcats lack that fight-
ing spirit that has been handed down as one
of the priceless heritages of Davidson men.

Laird played his best game of football
against the University of South Carolina
and gained the notice of all spectators and
coaches with his spectacular line plunging
and skirting of the ends for large gains.
The combination of Black, Laird, and Kees-
ler in the backfield proved too much for the
Gamecocks although they put up the stiffest
kind of a scrap. The Davidsonian of that
date gave much emphasis to the backfield’s
work, especially that of “Johnnie” Laird.
He was the lightest man on the team but
he more than made up for it with his speed.

This scrapping little wearer of the D
proved himself very much of a help on the
basketball court also for two years, Along
with Dutch Hengevelt, he romped with the
boys for a nice.string of victories taken from

\the scalps of most of the quintettes met. He

‘vas often referred to as the “moustached
gert” as he wore a cute little Charlie Chap-
lin eyebrow on his lips of a decided reddish
hue.

At last I’ve come to realize,
There is no place like home.
