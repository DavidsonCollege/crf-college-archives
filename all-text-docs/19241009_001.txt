North Carolina Theta Chater of the Sigma

Alpha Epsilon Fraternity which had an aver- |

age of 84.18 per cent. The award was lased

two-hundredths of a point separating the
winners of the runner-up, the Pi Kappa Al-
pha Fraternity? The latter had a small lead
at the end of the first semester, but. the
S. A. E.’s came back strong in the spring
term and won the much coveted cup. The
winner of last year, Beta Theta Pi, was third
in this contest.
