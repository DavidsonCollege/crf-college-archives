To Davidsonian

By MAC JEFFRIES

This is a confession. A confes-
sion by four culprits Of a campus-
shaking event. This is the true,
authentic, play-by-play description,
by the criminal themselves, of the
most dastardly and daring crime in
recent Davidson history—the hang-
ing of a beer sign literrally under
the’ very noces of the shocked
chambermaids,

son boys, whom we shall call One,

around, your reporter discovered
their identity, and wrangled the
following details. from_ them,

It seems that One and Two were
up the Mooresville road about a
mile Friday Might w Tew weeks ago
when their sharp eyes noticed a
‘ign leaning temptingly free against
a fence post. The sign read, as most
ots Mecklenburg knows by “now,
“Hornung’s Beer and Ale." ‘The
sdme idea hit both With one
movement they swept up the sign
and made tracks for home, with the
idea of redecorating Watts, But
scarcely had they entered the door,
when higher ambitions seized them.
Why not carry their insignia to
the heights of Chambers itself.

Daring Enterprise

The next afternoon they drafted
Three and Four for their project,
and set out to reconnoiter. ‘Climb-
ing to the dome, they saw that the
front door to the room back of the
dome was open, but the rear one
locked. Undaunted, they daringly
removed the pins from the hinges,
laid the door face-down and found
themselves in the room over the
auditorium, containing a window
overlooking a ledge. —Smugly, satis-
fied, they returned to await dark-
ness

Nightfall found the four adven-
turers sneaking guardedly saround
the rear of Chambers, bearing a

"Oox4 sign about as insignificant as a

billboard. Struggling forward, they
heard a footstep, and around the
corner came Mr. kEinker. Hastily,
the sign was deposited in a con-
venient bush, and the “innocent”
four cordially bid Mr Linker a
fond goodnight.

Up The Stairs

Searcely had the latter passed

prits were on his trail, watching

them.

Life

Dr. Poteat is a son of Dr. McNeill

hai, returning to this. country in
1937 to accept a professorship at
Crozier Theological Seminary in
Philadelphia;—Pa. He is a_ phi-
losopher, theologian, and authority

In the words of Dr. Poteat,
to be informed on the present
world struggle, we should be ac-
quainted with: its background and
with. values_involved. Taking as
his theme “World Revolution and
World Order,” the speaker said
‘that we should not simply “Re-
membér Pearl. Harbor,” but “Why
Peat! Harbor?” The morale ‘pur-
pose is inadequate.
