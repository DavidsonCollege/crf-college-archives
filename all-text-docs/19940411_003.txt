Giadunis school entrance exams

Do prep courses help your scores?

By Mary Clare Jalonick

Worried about the impact of
bad scores upon wary admissions
officers, studénts often consider
taking preparatory courses for
graduate entrance exams.

With advertisements flooding
the halls of Chambers and contro-
versy surrounding major test prepa-
ration companies, the decision is a
difficult one.

Classes at the local Princeton
Review and Kaplan Centers have
been popular in the past, but recent
questions concerning the validity
of score improvement claims have
recently thrown doubt on the ef-
fectiveness of these two respected,
and well known preparation
schools.

The Tests

Entrance exams frequently
taken by Davidson students include
the MCAT (Medical College Ad-
mission Test), LSAT (Law School
Admission Test), GMAT (Gradu-
ate Management Admission Test),

and the GRE (Graduate Record
Exam).

The MCAT and the LSAT are

usually seen as the more competi-
tive of the four, since medical and
law schools put more emphasis on
test scores.

The Preparatory Courses
Preparatory courses for all
entrance exams are offered by test-
ing'companies such as Kaplan and
Princeton Review.

When students opt to take a
preparatory course, they face the
difficult task of weighing its high
cost with its potential benefits.

Testing companies offer many
advantages such as local classes
and promising improvements for
participants,

To many students, the. possi-
bility of improving chances of ac-
ceptance at a good graduate school
is worth the high price for such
classes, around $700 at Princeton
Review and Kaplan.

The nondiscrimination policy

A significant step forward for
homosexual rights at Davidson
went largely unnoticed by the col-
legecommunity. Early inthe spring
of 1993, the college’s nondiscrimi-
nation policy was quietly changed.

attributes her positive experience
to “having been here for three years
before people knew. They got to
know me, as an individual, first.”

The first sexuality forum was
held in 1991, before the advent of
FLAG, with three Davidson alumni
as the speakers. The event contin-
ued annually with success. Jones
was the first homosexual to speak
at the event while attending
Davidson. This year, two current
students spoke openly about their
homosexuality. Also, for the first
time, two heterosexual students
discussed the exploration of their
sexuality.

Jones sees that the forums have
had a positive impact with all stu-
dents:
sexuality more. They never really
used to.”

FLAG

In the September 23, 1991 is-
sue of The Davidsonian, several.
students wrote letters-to-the-edi-
tor expressing their dismay with
an SAE flyer that portrayed lesbi-
ans as “uncool” and that was “slan-
derous to the gay community.”
That incident sparked interest in
students who wanted to combat
homophobia on the campus.

A group of twenty-five stu-
dents then went door to door circu-
lating a petition which stated that
the signers “support the presence
of a FLAG chapter on Davidson
campus to guarantee ...the rights of
the gay and lesbian community.”
The names of the several hundred
Students who signed were then
published in The Davidsonian.

SGA charter for the group. After

co-sponsors.”

Jones describes FLAG as “a
group of friends for lesbians and
gays... it’s a group that can lead
people to finding ways of sup-
port.” However, Jones says,
“FLAG’s primary function is pro-
gramming and working on making
Davidson as a whole more e toler-
ant.”

Jones sbneie! that FLAG
is an organization which “should
be run by students, while support-
ing and being supported by indi-
vidual faculty and staff members.”

As for the composition of the
group, 20 to 30 people normally

sexual orientation as one of the
areas in which Davidson does not
allow discrimination.

According to former SGA
president Alden Smith, that change
came about as a direct result of
college president Dr. Kuykendall’s
initiative. Smith says the addition
was “just an editorial change he
could make because it is not a
trustee document. It didn’t have to
be voted on by trustees, so it was
only done by hirh.”

Apparently, there have been
no problems with the individual
decision made by Kuykendall.
Smith says, “he checked it out with

the college lawyers to make sure it

would be OK to do that, and of
course it was OK, and it happened.”
