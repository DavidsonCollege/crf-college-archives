candidate’s moral qualifications be-
fore we vote for him—we don't
leave God “in the cold.”

As for the Phi Bete arguments,
there is a lot that could be said.
Torrey says that this recognition
makes for grades without education.
Most of us will agree that an “A”
student knows more about the giv-
en course than a “B” or “C” stu-
dent. Although the grade is mere-

| ly the professor's mathematical es-

timate of the man's knowledge of

the course, who, may I ask, is more
qualified to judge? The student,
| perhaps? Then’ we'd all be Phi

Retes.
If any sane student will consider

| without hypocrisy and with unbi-

ased mind these two honorary fra-
ternities which recognize the two
fundamental of college
life—service and leadership—he
must realize that -they are more
|than worthwhile—they are ex-
| ceedingly valuable. He must choose
| to gain his recognition by, accept-
|ing the honor rather than by pub-
|licly declining it, hoping to play
| upon the emotions of the envious.

| social life, athletic and musical ac-
| tivities, and boring classes. The
| only valid argument for a liberal
lKeute system is the very real social
| problem. We recommend a Dean's
| list of students having a 90 aver-
age or above, their cuts being ex-
tended to 6 per class and a 21 cut
total for all.
Delicate Problem

Thirdly, student-faculty relation-
ships are an extremely delicate
problem because of the autocratic
regime which is characteristic of
all American educational institu-
tions. An autocratic regime stifles
interest in democracy or republi-
can government. It is very import-
ant that the purpose of the stu-
dent-faculty relations committee be
revised to include the taking of
,steps to ascertain student opinion
ahead of time.

points. The first of these was
“Grass” by Carl Sandburg. This, he
said, is an excellent example of
the grammar or literal level of po-
etic writing. He then read a very
figurative poem, “Dr. Carpenter”

latter was of particular interest as
