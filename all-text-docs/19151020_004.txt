THE CAMPAIGN A SUCCESS

(Concluded from page 1)

you're young, because it is much easier.

The afternoon meeting was again held
in the church and the crowd was even
larger than before. The sermon on
“Justification” had as its text Corin-
thians 6:18. (1) We are justified freely
by His grace. (2) We are justified in-
strumentally by faith. (3) We are jus-
tified meritoriously by His righteousness.
(4) We are justified evidentially by
what we have and are. Singing by the
Charlotte visitors, and by all the girls
under sixteen varied the usual order of
service, and added much to the interest.

The last meeting, ‘Thursday night,
was on II Corinthians’8:5: “But first
gave their own selves to the Lord.” This
was fittingly the most powerful of all
the services and most blessed by visible
results. Fully fifty men took a new
stand for Christ, and the total of con-
versions rose to sixteen. It was a won-
derful meeting, and it was with mutual
regret that leaders and the student body
saw it draw to a close.

RESULTS.

The meetings literally “turned the
campus over” for Christ. There is every-
where a reawakened interest in spirit-
ual affairs. The membership in the Y.
M. C. A. has grown by leaps. and
bounds; new Bible classes have been
formed; and last Sunday nine men join-
ed the church, Davidson is rejoicing in
her blessings.

ATTENDANCE.

Throughout the meetings the attend-
ance was splendid. ‘The chapel was al-
ways full to overflowing, and at the
night services many were forced to
stand. At the church there was always
a very large congregation, and added
chairs failed to accomodate it.

SINGING.

One of the most enjoyable features
was the wonderful singing. Under Mr.
Alexander’s wholehearted and inspiring
leadership Davidson sang as it had never
sung before. “Shine, Shine, Just Where
You are!” rang out until the towns-
people stopped their work to listen.
“Just a Little Help From You!”’ was a
great favorite, so much so that Mr.
Alexander suggested it for our college
song. Mr. Brown time and again held
the entire audience spellhound by his
marvelous voice and wonderful earnest-
ness, and Mr. Barraclaugh won the
hearts of all.

When the party left Friday morning
for Asheville the student body was at
the station en masse, and yells and songs
proved their appreciation and love.

WHAT THE LEADERS SAY.

All the members of the party were
more than pleased with Davidson, Dr.
Chapman even saying that it was the
most impressive student body he had
ever seen. The earnestness and spirit-
uality of the men called forth special
comment, and it was agreed that they
had never held a more pleasant series of
meetings. .

WOFFORD IS DEFEATED

(Concluded from page 1)

netted 30 yards for Wofford. The ball
was now on Davidson’s 13-yard line, the
first time that her goal had been threat-
ened. ‘However, Wofford failed to gain
on attempted forward passes, the ball
went over, and McAlister, in a long
end run brought the ball back 35 yards,
where. it rested at the beginning of the
fourth quarter.

A few good gains by Laird and Kees-
ler brought the ball to Wofford’s 1-yard
line and Black went over for the third
touchdown. Grey kicked goal. Wof-
ford, receiving the next kick off, return-

ed the ball to her 30-yard line. Here
Black intercepted a forward pass and
went for a touchdown. Grey failed at
goal. Wofford, receiving, returned the
ball to her 22-yard line. Failing to
make the necessary gains on downs, Os-
borne punted. Black made a run of 30
yards and later carried the ball over for
the fifth touchdown.
run of 15 yards Crouch made the sixth
touchdown, and by intercepting a for-
‘ward pass and making+a 45-yard run
scored the seventh and last touchdown.

QUIPS AND CRANKS
CONTRACT CLOSED

W. G. Morrison and L. A. Mullen,
business manager and editor-in-chief re-
spectively of “Quips and Cranks,” state
that they have closed the contract for the
printing and engraving for the 1916 vol-
ume, but are very reticent as to details.
It is understood, however, that Foote
and Davies, of Atlanta, will publish the
book, and that a very unique Annual. is
being designed.

The students have. responded very
liberally in signing up for “Quips
and Cranks” this vear, and if this con-
tinues there is every reason to expect the
Annual to hold its place among the fore-
most college annuals of the South.

The staff is composed of the following

men: Literary Department, F. H.
Smith, J. L. Payne, Latta Law, L. A.
Chambliss; Art Department, J. F.

made later); business manager, W. G.
Morrison; assistant manager, E. G.
Hampton: official photographer, Roy

PAN-HELLENIC RULING.

are ladies present.
