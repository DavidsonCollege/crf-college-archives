Cats Open Ambitious Season

BY RICK LOWERY
Davidsonian Sports Editor
In what is fast becoming a

one-sport town, the moment of

‘truth is here. This year’s basket-

ball season is under way and
the show is bigger and better
than ever. Having rolled over
Hampden-Sydney last Saturday
night, the ‘Cats play Wake For-
est in the Charlotte Coliseum
tomorrow night at 8.

Last year saw a surprising
break into the big time as Dav-
idson beat Duke, finished sec-
ond in the Southern Confer-
ence and compiled a 20-7
record. Coach Driesell was
named outstanding Southern
Conference coach, and Fred
Hetzel was named outstanding
Southern Conference player,
leading Conference scorer, and
first team all-tournament. This
year’s club is under a lot of
pressure to produce.

Gone from last year’s team
is center Bill Jarman, holder
of several Davidson records and
a man surely to be missed. But
Jarman’s. departure is also the
occasion for Dick Snyder's ap-
pearance a varsity perform-
er.

Snyder, a 6'5’. sophomore
labeled as “can’t miss,”’ led the
freshman team last year with
a 25.9 scoring average and was
also the top rebounder. Snyder

WAKE FOREST TOMORROW

has already moved into _ this
year’s line-up.

In addition to the untried
Snyder, the remainder of last
year’s team returns. Led by
Fred Hetzel, probably the most
outstanding Davidson athlete
to have put on a uniform in re-
ceht history, the ‘Cats hope to
send a team on the floor which
will surpass last year’s.

Hetzel, who last year re-

wrote practially all of the
Davidson individuval single
game and season's scoring
records plus nabbing several
conference honors, has put on
several good pounds and his
early season practice sessions
can best be summed up in the
words of an expert but neu-
tral observer (who shall go
unnamed), “! don’t think I’ve
ever seen him work so hard
before. | don‘'t know; some-
thing just seems different
from last year. He’s just unbe-
lievable.”

Perhaps these words seem to
glow but somehow a ball player

like Hetzel often carries an
image of effortless ease with
him, an. image that seems to
“It's so easy, I'm not really
trying.”
Holding up the big end along
with Hetzel is captain Terry
Holland. Holland suffered a

broken nose in early practices

but has fully recovered. In fact
as another observer commented,
“More than fully recovered.”

Holland this year will move
to the pivot to team with Het-
zel. Although this move will
probably rob Holland of some of
his previous court sureness, he’s
already demonstratetd an amaz-
ing tapping and rebounding
touch. And can he run!

Filling the guard-forward
slot will be last year’s al-
most forgotten man, Don
Davidson. Perhaps forgotten
isn’t the right word—under-
rated. For in Davidson, the
‘Cats had a baliplayer who
could rebound, play defense
and drive. “Had,” because
something must be added;
this year he can shoot and
has done so all fall.

The guard spot belongs to
Barry Teague. Teague last year
made the all-tournament second
team and proved to be a steady
ballhandler and a top competi-
tor. This year is no different.
Teague still the heads-up

guard, has’ provided and will

Bill Beermann, one of two
seniors on the team, also plays
either guard or forward. A for-

ing trophy and one of the finest
shots on the team, Beermann
should give the ‘Cats excellent
depth, and valuable experience.

The biggest surprise this

year could be Paul Briggs.
Briggs, who has seen only
limited action in the past, has
developed into a good ball
player. He's 6'5”, can re-
bound, shoot, and from all ap-
pearances has learned his way
around the court.

Cam Harkness and Ronnie
Stone round out this year's
team. Both of these boys are
sophomores and at this stage
only time will tell.

DAVIDSON COLLEGE, ‘DAVIDSON, N. C. SUNDAY, DECEMBER 1, 1963

‘NU MBER ‘TWEL VE

In the wake of the release of mid-semester
ecarious status of being on ac
ber includes 17 freshmen, seven sophomores, 14 juniors,

find themselves on the pr
down by classes, this num
and 16 seniors.

In order to be placed on pro-
bation this year, a student must
fail to earn grades represent-
ing at least 12 semester hours
and nine quality points. The
12:9 requirement was adopted
this fall to replace the nine-six
requirement in effect last year.

Much pressure was exerted
on the faculty before their
meeting on Nov. 5 of this year
to go back to the nine-six
standard; however, the major-
ity felt that this was unrealis-
tic.

Last year at this time there
were only 16 men in all four
classes on AP. But, also, last
year under the nine-six rule,
a student could receive two
C’s, a D, and two F’s and still
be considered in good stand-
ing, i.e., not on AP.

In commenting on the rather
large number of seniors ‘on AP,
Dean of Students Richard C.
Burts suggested that some may
have already earned their re-
quired 124 quality points for
graduation and now feel free
to “coast.”

At that same faculty meet-
ing on Nov. 5, three other sig-
nificant changes were adopted
in regard to AP:

1. A student can go on or off
AP at either mid- or end of-
semester. Under the change
that would have gone into ef-
fect, a student could go on AP,

grades,

but not off at mid-semester.

2. The six-weeks freshman
grade reports will be complete-
ly unofficial. Last year, these
reports placed many freshmen
on AP.

3. A student on AP can now
represent the college in off-
campus school-sponsored activi-
ties, as long as he does not miss
any classes. Thus the major
consequence of being placed on
AP is being prohibited from
cutting any classes.

The results of the first two
of these changes have already
been seen. Of 24 freshmen
placed on AP at the end of the
first six-weeks (before the fac-
ulty approved the most recent
changes), 13 of them are no
longer on AP at the mid-semes-
ter report. Of the three seniors
carried over on AP from last
year, two have been dropped
from probation at mid-semester,
instead of waiting until the end
of the semester.

In an_ interview _ before
Thanksgiving, Dean Burts also
answered questions concerning
the “underachievement”  pro-
gram. In August a letter was
sent to 93 of Davidson's 500
rising sophomores and juniors
informing them that they were
producing grades far below
their expected capacities.

In discussing both the pro-
grams of underachievement and

emphasized that neither was in-

similar programs at other col-

of Davidson's own situation and
the selective admissions pro-
gram in effect since 1956.

proving faculty and curriculum
the college is now more con-

cerned with academic achieve- °

“from Exeter to Davidson”

Assassination Cuts Grid Season Short

BY RICK LOWERY
Davidsonian Sports Editor

On a Saturday when few
people cared about football,
Davidson’s season ended—
no contest.

This year's final record was
1-5-2. It was a year character-
ized by bad breaks, bad foot-
ball, grumbles and a great deal
of disappointment. Probably
as no other dismal football sea-
son, this one was the most dis-
appointing. Early season prac-
tice and scrimmages had point-
ed to a fine year. In fact, I
believe this team was the best
Davidson team I have seen in
five years. I said, “was,” be-
cause at season’s end, it was
not.

What happened on the way?

will just shake their heads.

Now that the year is over, al-
most anyone can have a
guess. | doubt if there is any
simple answer.

The season was not without
its high spots. Unfortunately
perhaps the highest was pre-
season and didn’t even count,
but several people saw a David-
son team that looked pretty
good. Certainly the season’s
high must have been reached,
however, in the VMI game. But
ties just aren't like wins; they
leave a funny taste.

Neither was the season with-
out its low moments. A rainy
afternoon with The Citadel; a
ninety yard (plus) runback of a
blocked field goal; a missed
field goal in the last seconds of
the PC game; and a Friday
night in Charlotte.

Football season is over and
so is football for twelve seniors.

Billy Mills, who came from
the flickerball fields to become
quite an end both offensively
and defensively,

Bill Dole, who lettered three
years as a varsity lineman and
had the toughest time for that,

Jim Fuller, halfback, fullback,
end, tackle, linebacker and
punter but never runner like
at Furman a long time ago,

Britt Smith, top center and
outstanding linebacker, whose
defensive skills were prohibited
by an auto accident,

Barry Billington, a halfback
hampered by injuries,

Dave Lopp, another back per-
haps just too small to withstand
injury who never saw his best
game,

Morris Williams, who after
the whistle blew wanted to win
most of all,

Benny Coxton, probably the
finest natural football player to
ever show at Davidson and yet
no one can say how good he
could have been,

Dick Fuip, probably the one
man who can say he did so
much and got so little,

Joe Jones, another three year

performer who battled his way
into the number one backfield.

Earl Cole, who proved to be
an outstanding defensive, as
well as offensive, standout and
was recently elected co-captain,

Russell Walls, the other co-
captain has made the all aca-
demic Southern Conference
team, was recently tapped into
Omicron Delta Kappa, received
the Earl Blaik award, and was
a fine football player.

This season's record looms
prominently as a dark disap-
pointment. I think it all started
on a bitter night against Fur-
man, a night in which Davidson
was beaten but not really out-
played, That team and the team
that tied VMI could have put
together a winning season; they
didn’t. And because they didn’t

sessions will make this quite
clear. The only thing I'd like
to know is how many still love
football?

football players in the country

tic standing, football ability,
