“We lose Chappell, but we'll still have Bob Wollard,
Richard Carmichael and Frank Christie, and Richard
Herring from this year’s freshman team will help a lot,
too,” he pointed out.

Davidson coach Lefty Driesell remarked, ‘“‘I’ll have to
thank Jackie for saying that. I'll remember and tell it to
my boys next year before the Wake Forest game.”

THE CHARLOTTE OBSERVER

The above column appeared in The Charlotte Obser-
ver when Davidson’s fabulous freshman team were still
freshmen. Now they're sophomores, playing varsity ball,
and it’s time to test Murdock’s prophesy. The ’Cats meet
Wake in the Coliseum next Wednesday night to. decide
whether they are in the same “class” with Bones McKin-
ney’s Deacons.

We, however, think that this question has already
been decided. The ’Cats have already proved what “class”
of ball they can play, and it doesn’t take much effort to
see that this is at least on a par with Deacon ball.

Both teams have come face to face with third ranked
Duke twice this year. The ’Cats fought it out to the wire
in the first contest, losing only after Don Davidson and
Fred Hetzel fouled out; and in their second contest, they

sets, which means that there are

ers, so they will be out for

For this performance, Wright
a senior from Richmond, Va.,

every match he has wrestled

What makes this all the more

The Wildcat rifle squad car-

journeyed to Greenville, S. C.,
for a shootout with Furman’s
marksmen.

In a match with the Paladins
earlier this season the ’Cat fir-
ers came out victorious 1365-
1330. The Furman match will be
the last regular season contest.

The ‘Cats’ record fell last
Friday when they were defeated
by a strong team from Clemson.
Although they were defeated,
the ‘Cat firers compiled their
highest match score of the sea-
son, 1387.

Leading the team consistently
this season has been senior Bill

season is 280 (of a possible
