DOLE’S BEEN BUSY RECRUITING TOO

Coach Bill Dole has the ability to make his scholar-
ships go a long way. Next fall will see him bring to this
campus some 18 boys with the 9¥% full scholarships that
he had to offer this year. Dole, under the handicap of
having to recruit with less to offer in scholarships than
other Southern Conference school (next lowest gives

any ,
18 full scholarships), has brought in a group of boys who .
range from Florida to Ohio.

Dole seems pleased with the crop of footballers that
he has attracted, saying that this group contains many
outstanding individual performers. “We have two out-
standing ends in Phil Hightower and John Hinsley,” he
commented. “Hinsley, on top of being an excellent high
school tackle, rong a = —_ found time to make
straight A’s during his school career.

a couple of hen sized 245 pound tackles will fill
out the freshman line = well. Dan Barefoot and
Thomas Simmons are refe: to by Dole as “two of the
largest freshman ballplayers I’ve had.”

SPRING GAME LOOKED GOOD

Dole was pleased with the results of the spring
game last Saturday. Many individual performances, par-
ticularly by the rising sophomores, showed him that he
will have something to work with in trying to find re-
placements to fill the big gaps left in the squad by the
graduating seniors. oe Re

Dole expects much help in the end position from
Steve Heckard, who really sparked in Saturday's game,
Will Jackson, Sam Bowers, and Steve Davidson. He added
that Billy Mills, a rising junior who hasn’t been out for
the team before, will “be playing a lot of offense.”

For the interior line he mentioned Bruce Dalton,
David Walker (on defense), Jay Rodgers, and Don Hall.
Rodgers and Hall will add a lot of weight to the line.

the backfield, Dave Hendrix be seeing action
in the fullback on, and Gene Ferris, Pat Fisher, and
Tommy Worrell will add much depth at the fullback slot.
According to Dole, Worrell has “more potential because
of speed and size than any back around here since Jim

Thacker.”

All these boys will be ge their share of varsity
experience next year because of Dole’s 2% platoon sys-
tem. Dole hopes to field two teams which can go both
ways, with one b offensive and the other

defensive. In addition he will field a third unit

of hitting. In otuer action this
week, the Independents elimin
ated the SPE's from the tourna-
ment with an 8-7 victory Wed-

The ‘Cat cindermen will be

tle said that he also expected
Pembroke and East Carolina to
be there but he had received no
confirmation from them as of
Wednesday afternoon.

Whittle was optimistic about
Davidson's chances in defending

, they have had a “very good

| The ’Cat tracksters hold the

The main difference between

a relay meet and a regular track

meet is that the normal running

events, like the 440 yd. dash and

the mile run, have been taken

the form of relays. The field
events remain the same.

The relay events to pe run
tomorrow are the 440 relay, 880

lay, and the sprint relay. Whittle
is looking for good perform-
ances tomorrow from Andy

In commenting on the purpose
of the Davidson Relays, Whittle
stated, “There aren't too many
relays around in which small
schools can compete since there
is such tough competition in ‘e-
lays like the Furman Relays.
The purpose of the Davidson
Relays is to provide a chance for

small schools who don't subsi-

equal basis.”

BREAKS SCHOOL RECORD

John Sharp, running well for
Davidson all season, broke the
school record for the 440 yd
dash with a posted time of 49}
seconds flat. The old record was
49.5 seconds which was set by Al
Elder in 1956.

Another college record nar-
rowly missed being broken at

dently stepped back: when he

Last Saturday afternoon the
Davidson gridders ended spring
practice with an intra-squad
game which saw Kent Tucker's
White team defeat Earl Cole‘s
Red team, 19-14, at Richardson
Field.

The Whites scored on a 55-
yard off-tackle run by Dave
Lopp, a 45-yard pass and run
from Tucker to Joe Jones, and
a four-yard plunge by fullback
Carl Hunt.

The Reds scored on two touch-
down passes by quarterback
Cole. One was a 20-yard flip to
sophomore Steve Heckard, the
other a 15-yard toss to Rick
Smith.

Sophomore Barry Story kick-
ed three extra points—two for
the Reds, and one for the
Whites. Dole looks. for Story to
strengthen the team next fall
in the field goal department.

Dole, commenting on the 20-
day spring practice, said that
“the idea now is to develop the
individual football player.

We'll practice teamwork in the
fall.”

He stated that in the quarter.
back position Cole was “doing
a good job” and that Tucker
“looked real good” throughout
‘spring practice. He expressed
the hope that Alex Gibbs would

knee operation and so be able to

help out at the quarterback and
halfback slots.

Benny Coxton, star quarter-
back at the beginning of last
season, is out due to a nerve
separation in his shoulder. He
will have it checked in June to}
see whether the nerve is grow- |
ing out and regenerating. !

“There will be eleven or |
twelve sophomores playing a lot
of football next year,” stated |
Dole. “They'll make a lot of
mistakes, but we expect that of |
sophomores. They need that var-
sity game experience.”

Asked to comment on David-
son's chances in the Southern
Conference race next fall, Dole
explained, “Well, it’s the same
situation as always at Davidson.
The other schools have more
scholarships to offer. You know,
you get more cream from a gal-
lon of milk than you do from a
quart. But as soon as our sopho-
mores gain that experienge we
should have a pretty good foot-
ball team.”

The ’Cats open the season on
September 15, against Catawba
College in Charlotte.

Dole has recruited a “fine
group” of 18 freshmen, the larg-
est group of scholarship boys
since 1953. “We've been lucky
to lure boys here with only par-
tial scholarships,” said Dole.

Meet BelmontAbbeyHere

Tuesday afternoon, the 'Cats travel to Charleston, S. C., to try to extend theii

hot streak which began last Saturday when they defeated George Washington

continued with a defeat of Mercer by the same score.
The ’Cats entertained Belmont Abbey here this afternoon.

The return of Tom Harris to
the 'Cat mound gave the team a
big boost Saturday, with Harris
allowing only two men to reach
third base, and mastered the
Generals on two hits. Harris has
been sidelined with arm trouble
all spring.

Harris was helped out by a
much improved defense. The
infield was sharper than it had
been all season, and took Harris
out of possible trouble with two
late inning double plays. Tom
Hamilton continued his flawless
play in center field,

The Davidson hitting was sup-
plied by the middle of the line
up, second baseman Tom Tuttle
and catcher Harry Cline, who
both went three for five

Netmen Try State
After Citadel Loss

Coach Harry Fogleman’s net-
ters tackled N.C, State here to-
day trying to avenge a 5-4 loss
to the Wolfpack two years ago.

The Wolfpack ‘features as
their number one man a Pakis-
tanian, who is playing his third
year at State. Fogleman pro-
fesses to know nothing about
the State team’s strength. Andy
Sherrill, one of Davidson’s net-
men, stated that he thought they
were “down from last year.”

In a match Monday, the ‘Cat
netters take on Wake Forest, a
team that lost to Michigan State
7-2, the same score that they
downed the ‘Cats earlier this
year.

In action against the defend-
ing Southern Conference cham-
pions from The Citadel on Wed-
nesday, the ‘Cats dropped a
tough decision, 63, to the skill-
ed Bulldog team.

A differenct outcome in
hard-fought matches between
Bobby Snead and Stewart Levi
in the second match and be-
tween Andy Sherrill and; Rod
Carlyle in the fourth match
could have given the 'Cats a
close 5-4 victory.

Davidson had better luck in
the doubles play, winning two of
three doubles matches. Victor-
ies went to Bobby Austell and
Stefan Young, and Bill Back-
lund and Gene McCutchen.

double, and a wrong field triple,
which drove in two runs among
his hits; while Cline, who is in
line for another all-conference
berth, doubled twice, driving in
two runs.
MERCER BOMBED
The ‘Cats continued to get
good pitching Wednesday as
Tom Hamilton threw a three
hitter against Mercer. Cline con-
tinued his great hitting with
four hits in five at bats, includ-
ing a double and a triple.
Hamilton gave up three hits
and five walks, but worked his
way out of trouble by striking
out nine. The run scored. off
him was unearned, scoring on
two errors in the outfield.
After the two games at the
Citadel, the ‘Cats journey to

1, and
West Virginia University fer a
single game May 5, and then
visit George Washington at

Washington. West Virginia is
the conference favorite, and has
lost but one conference game.
The Citadel has lost to George
Washington 2-1 at Charleston.
