Phonathon

By ELIZABETH KISS
News Editor

Three hundred sixteen David-
son students participated in the
SGA Telephonathon, which
ended last Thursday. They
raised $61,078 in alumni contri-
butions.

The gifts came from 1070
alumni, 304 of whom were
giving for the first time.

“I’m deeply grateful to the
leaders of the Phonathon and to
all the students who partici-
pated,’’ Living Endowment

Director Lee Willingham said. .

In addition to raising money, he
added, the event had ‘‘a real
positive impact on the alumni.”

Money from the Telephona-
thon will go toward meeting the
$100,000 Dana Foundation
challenge grant. This grant has
two requirements. To receive
the first $70,000 of the grant,
the College must raise $438,000
in its Living Endowment drive,
which ends December 31. This
is $70,000 more than the College
raised last year.

“The good news as of today,”
Willingham said, ‘‘is that con-
_ tributions are running 23%
ahead of the same date last
year.”

The College will receive the
remaining $30,000 if new donors
give $10,000 or more and if at
least 28% of all living alumni
contribute. Last year alumni
participation was 23%.

‘“‘T feel strongly that we’ll
make it,’’ Willingham said,
“and the Phonaton will be the
margin of difference that will
get us there.”’

The Telephonathon raised
$8 ,248 from new donors, almost
enough to meet the required
total of $10,000. Willingham
said these new donors were a
major factor in the increase in
alumni participation, which is
21% to date.

i Faculty tenure committee
topic of discussion again

By ELIZABETH KISS
News Editor

The faculty may form a.

committee to evaluate colleag-
ues who are under consideration
for tenure.

Fifteen professors attended
an open meeting called by the
Professional Affairs Committee
(PAC) Tuesday to discuss the
possibility of establishing a
faculty advisory committee on
tenure and promotions.

PAC Chairman and German
Professor Hansford Epes said
the PAC called the meeting to
help them decide if they should
propose such a committee in
January. The proposal would
need approval of two thirds of
the faculty to pass.

Epes said he does not know
yet whether the PAC will decide
to make a proposal.

A similar PAC proposal fell
short.of approval by eight votes
in January 1979. At the time,

Police arrest thief seen in Chambers

By JOHN SIMAN
. News Editor

Junior Randy McManus
helped College security officers
apprehend a suspected thief
Friday morning.

McManus reported seeing the
man reach into the pockets of

coats hanging in Chambers just

before 10 a.m. Friday. Using
McManus’ description, Secur-
ity Chief J.G. Hughes was able
to find the man by 10:15.

Security officers had been
looking for the man since
Thursday, for they suspected
him of taking English Professor
Cynthia Lewis’ wallet from her
office.

The suspect, a prisoner on
work release from Camp Green
in Salisbury, has been sent
“back to the big house where
he’ll pull the rest of the sent-
ence,’’ Hughes said. He had

(David McCurry)

been working on a crew employ-
ed by Southeastern Waterproof-
ing Company, which is doing
maintenance work on Cham-
bers.

McManus had been reading
in the hall of third floor Cham-
bers before seeing the suspect
reaching into coat pockets. ‘‘He
looked like he’d been caught red
handed,’’ McManus said.

“T was initially mad,” Mc-
Manus said. ‘I asked him what
he’d been doing.”

When the man did not res-
pond McManus ; followed him
down the stairs and watched
him leave Chambers. Then he
told Personnel Director Robert

‘Stevenson about the incident.

Stevenson got McManus in
touch with Hughes, and Mc-
Manus gave a detailed descrip-
tion of the man. Within minutes
Hughes found the man working
with a crew on the roof of
Chambers.

Hughes said that since the
suspect is being sent back to
prison, it would not be worth
the trouble to prosecute him.

“The highest privilege in the
prison system is work release,”’
Hughes said, ‘‘and he blew it.”

Hughes said the man is now
serving a sentence for breaking
and entering, larceny, and pos-
session of marijuana. He has
also served time for auto theft
in New York.

Security Officer Wayne King
said companies working for the
College are supposed to notify
security if they employ any
convicts on work release, but
Southeastern Weatherproofing
failed to do so.

“That won’t happen again,”
Hughes said.

McManus has received a
note of appreciation from Phys-
ical Plant Director Grover
Meetze, who supervises secur-

that the issue would ‘“‘come up
again in one or two years.”

Elizabeth Kiss and John Sim-

Tuesday’s election for The Da-
vidsonian editorship.

Kiss and Siman will take
office immediately after Christ-
mas break.

Both have worked on the
newspaper staff since their
freshman year, and most re-
cently served as co-editors of
the news section. They ran
primarily on their experience,
but emphasized that they do
plan to change The Davidson-
ian.

They plan to expand features
coverage with stories on stud-
ent activities such as College
Bowl, debate team, and ROTC.
They also plan to expand sports
coverage to include more wo-
men’s and minor sports.

In the opinions section, Kiss
and Siman would like to have
more and shorter opinions col-
umns, and to use satire occa-
sionally.

Also, they would like to
periodically print student art
and creative writing in a separ-

During spring term, Siman

Rhodes nominees defeated at state level

By ANNE GOODWIN
Staff Writer

Four Davidson seniors were
state candidates for Rhodes
scholarships this year.

_Rob Campany, John Davis,
Blaine Sanders, and David
Waddill were interviewed by
state selection committees this
week. None advanced to the
district level.

The Rhodes scholarship,
which provides for two or three
years of study at Oxford Uni-
versity , is awarded to 32 Ameri-
can college seniors who demon-
strate high academic perfor-
mance, leadership, and interest
in athletics. Nineteen Davidson
alumni have been Rhodes schol-
ars.

Rob Campany, a philosophy
major from Abingdon, Virginia,

_ said he had wanted to apply for

a Rhodes Scholarship for a long
time. The English system of
weekly discussion meetings
with a tutor attracted him more
than the ‘‘soak it up, feed it
back’”’ method he finds in some
Davidson classes.

Campany wanted to study
moral and social and political
philosophy at Oxford. He
planned to examine the nature
of political authority, the rela-
tionship between church and
state—‘‘the myth of the secular
state’ in his words—and the
concept of the social welfare
state.

Campany is not certain about

a career choice, but he said he
leans towards teaching religion
or ethics on the college level. He
has also applied for the Luce
and Fulbright scholarships. _

John Davis, also a philo-
sophy major, is from Char-
lottesville, Virginia. He had
“always thought about”’ apply-
ing for a Rhodes scholarship.
Though he hag enjoyed. his
liberal arts studies, he would
now like to do more in-depth

work.
