Men’s hoops survives scare vs. VMI, moves to 9-6 record

By Matt Pitzer

When men’s basketball coach
Bob McKillop looks over this sea-
son so far, he looks past the medio-
cre 9-6 record, past frustrating
losses to Furman last Monday and
to UNCC on Jan. 12. He looks past
a Christmas-tournament defeat at
Boise State, and, instead, he looks
to last season.

Last year, the Wildcats started
the season at 9-5, including wins
over bad N.C. State and Clemson
teams that got everybody excited,
before faltering at home to Appa
lachian State and to The Citadel on
the road at about this time.

Now, after a pretty tough out-
of-conference schedule, Davidson
finds itself in the same position
after its most recent losses.

The road back to the top of the
conference and, hopefully, a
postseason bid started Saturday
with an 83-75 win over VMI. Once
again, a comparison to last year
pops up. After the loss to The
Citadel, the Wildcats won 13 out
of 14 games to advance into the

Southern Conference final, with
the first win also coming against
the Keydets.

And so, the question now be-

comes: Can this year’s squad do
the same thing?

“I think our players remember
what it took to get there last sea-
son,” McKillop said. “I think they
learned what it takes, how to over-
come adversity and respond posi-
tively.”

Five of the Wildcats’ six losses
this season have come to teams
ranked in the top-50 in various
power rankings in the country:
Syracuse, Seton Hall, Wake For-
est, Boise State and UNCC.

‘We expected to be better than
8-6,” McKillop said, “but we’re
not better than 8-6. ... We beat one
top-50 team last year (UNCC), and
we’ve beaten one this year (also
UNCC). We stayed close against
those other teams, but we didn’t
win. I think we’re pretty much on
a parallel track to where we were

‘last year.”

In a mostly inconsistent sea-
son, the one constant has been
shooting problems. Low shooting
percentages have hounded the
Wildcats all season, including a
32.8% performance against Syra-
cuse way back on Dec. 3, 41.2% in
the first UNCC game, 41.4%
against Seton Hall, 35.5% in the

second UNCC game and just 35.4%
Saturday against VMI.

Overall for the season, the
team is shooting at about 45%, but
when Davidson hits at higher than
that mark, it is 6-0, compared to
just 3-6 when below that line.

The main problems there, ac-
cording to McKillop, is an ongo-
ing attempt to find that delicate
balance between being an up-
tempo, fast-break team and pull-
ing the ball out to set up the half-
court offense when those
breakaway opportunities aren’t
there. Compounding the problem
is the lack of a consistent go-to-
player, a role filled by Janko Narat
last season.

“We really want to encourage
aggressiveness,” McKillop said.
“We understand the philosophy,
but we’re not executing.. (When
the fast-break isn’t open), they’re
trying to hit a home run each time
instead of just trying to make con-
tact. What happens is that we’re
playing offense from the heels.”

Junior forward Brandon Wil-
liams was expected to jump right
into the void that Narat left, and he

Wildcat wrestlers continue to make progress during season

By Rich Glenn —

The wrestling team has gotten
off to a solid start to this promising
season under the guidance of coach
Tom Oddo with some solid
preformances prior to and during
the holiday break.

The Wildcats beat the Divi-
sion I Wagner team, 31-12, and
then they defeated Washington &
Lee. “The W&L match was a big
win for us,” Oddo said.

It was the first win in a long
time for the Wildcats against the
Generals, but the meet turned out
to the biggest win for Davidson of
the season.

Before the break, Davidson
faced off against The Citadel with
a team weakened by injuries and
lost 31-13. The Wildcats will
wrestle the Bulldogs later this year
with a chance to redeem them-
“selves. “We look forward toa very
close match with The Citadel when

we have our full lineup back,” Oddo
said.

Unfortunately, Davidson will
be without freshman Ben Wall for
the rest of the season, who is out
with a neck injury. Wall had been
wrestling very well, and led the
Southern Conference in pins and
had an 8-5 overall record.

Wall couldn’t wrestle when
the team returned early from the
break to face VMI, a squad that
beat Davidson 51-0 last season.
“We closed the margin signifi-
cantly,” Oddo said about the match
that wound up 36-9.

Another freshman who has
shown great potential is Barrett
Rose: He is wrestling in the heavy-
weight division, but at just 205
pounds he is going up against other
opponents who push the 275-pound
weight limit. “Barrett is a fighter,”
Oddo said.

Together with Wall, the fresh-

man duo form a young and tal-
ented end of the lineup that should
just improve over time.” Also, cap-
tains Sean Harvey and Derek Spen-
cer have also contributed to the

early success of the Wildcats.
“Injuries lave definitely taken
their toll,” Oddo said as he
scrambled his lineup in attempt to
fill the gaps. But the team still
competes hard with great desire as

it prepares for the Southern Con-
ference tournament in March. The
next home meet is Feb. 11 when
Davidson hosts the Alumni Re-
union match.

Swimmers and divers lose meet against
UNC-Wilmington

by William Robert

The men’s and women’s '

swimming and diving teams trav-
elled to take on a tough UNC-
Wilmington team Saturday. Both
teams were defeated; the men’s
team lost 122 to 112, and the
women fell 122 to 97. Despite the
loss, the meet was not without sev-
eral outstanding performances.
On the men’s side, freshman
Matt Buck eclipsed another

Women’s hoops hit hard by
conference rival UT-Chattanooga

A close game ended in defeat
for the women’s’ basketball team
in their toss against Southern Con-
ference foe, Tennessee-Chatta-
nooga on Saturday at home.

The Moccasins broke open a
close game early in the second half
to ensure their win with a final
score of 72-61.

With sixteen minutes remain-
ing in the game, Moccasin coach,
Craig Parrott, was ejected with two
technical fouls. The Big D hoped
to play off of this situation to de-
crease the point spread; however,
they were unsuccessful and fell in
the end. :

The Wildcats were led by jun-
ior Kristen Ferrucci who carried
the team with 17 points, including
six of six shooting from the field.
Unfortunately, this was not enough
to come from behind.

Captain Kristen Solsrud said,
“We can play better.” She contin-
ued to say that no one was please
with their court performance.

The Wildcats continue: to
search for their first conference
victory of the season. Their next
opponent will be Georgia South-
ern, the defending conference

champions, tonight in Belk Arena -

at 6:30 p.m..

Though this next challenge
will prove to be as difficult, the
Wildcats hope to retain a positive
attitude. In their last meeting with
Georgia Southern they lost by only

- eight points in the conference tour-

nament. Says Solsrud, “We have
nothing to lose.”

Following this game,
Davidson will hit the road to face
East Tennessee State and Marshall
next weekend.

Currently the Wildcats stand
at 4-12 overall with a 0-4 confer-
ence record.

Davidson College record — his
fourth of the season — with a vic-
tory in the 400 IM. His time of
4:15.13 bettered the previous mark
set by junior co-captain Churchill
Hooff. Buck also won the 200
breaststroke in 2:09.54, which is
right at his season-best time in the
event.

Freshman Freddy Schnell also
had two outstanding performances.
His time in the 200 backstroke,
1:55.47, reset the school mark he
set in November and was good
enough for second in the event. He
also reset his 100 back record with
a54.38 from his lead-off leg on the
400 medley relay. Both backstroke
times were lifetime bests for
Schnell. He was also victorious in
the 200 freestyle with a 1:46.38.

Sophomore diver Michael
Hart also earned victories for the
Wildcats on both the 1 meter and 3
meter boards.

Other outstanding perfor-
tances were turned in forthe men’s
team by Hooff with a pair of sec-
onds in the 200 and 500 freestyles
and freshman diver Jonathan Frost,
who placed third on both boards.

For the women’s team, out-
standing performances came from

freshmen Heather Sweeney witha
second in the 400 IM, Allison
Beebe’s third in the 200 fly and
second in the 500, and Stephanie
Grey with a second in the 1000.
Sophomore Susanne Herring
placed third in both the 100 and the
200, and junior co-captain
Katharine Welling placed second
in the 200 back. Junior diver Meg
Bentley took third place in 1 meter
competition.

Also of note were the perfor-
mances of sophomores Kary Th-
ompson and Ann Hatfield, who
both went lifetime best times in
both the 500 and 1000; Thompson
placed third in the 1000.

‘ The Wildcats head into the
homestretch of their season with
only three meets remaining before
hosting the Southern States cham-
pionship meet in mid-February.
Both teams travel on Thursday to
Pfeiffer College, where the women
will swim Pfeiffer and the men
will take on VMI. The men con-
clude the week witha meet at home
against Georgia Tech on Sunday at
1:00 p.m. The teams will then
rejoin forces as they travel to
Durham the following Saturday to
face both Duke and Richmond.
