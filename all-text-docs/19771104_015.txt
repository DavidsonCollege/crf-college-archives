Crystal ball predicts bowl matchups

By PAUL BANTA
Sports Columnist

Sports shorts--For the first
time in a long while, the Rose
Bowl may be unimportant as
far as the national champion-
ship is concerned.

Southern Cal, UCLA and
California are the main compe-
titors still in the race for the
Pac-8’s spot in the Pasadena
classic, but none are in race for
number one. Because of the
number of other good teams
around, Michigan or Ohio
State need a lot of things to
happen before much attention
is paid to their claims.

Unless Texas falls victim to
Texas A&M, which is doubt-
ful, Dallas will be the site of
the national championship
game. Officlas of the Cotton

IMACReport

Bowl have the inside track on
getting Notre Dame to face
the Longhorns, a match-up
which was quite successful in
the 1970 and 1971 Cotton
Bowls.

Either Oklahoma or Nebras-
ka, (Iowa State will be out of
the picture by November’s
end will be lined up against
the winner of the Pitt-Penn
State game, in the Orange
Bowl, according to my crystal
ball.

With Oklahoma and Penn
State, the people in Miami
would have another top game,
but if it ends up Nebraska-Pitt
then the contest will be one of
Gator Bowl quality.

That leaves Alabama to face
the loser of the Big Ten title
game, in the Sugar Bowl. It

might be an interesting one,
but the whold nation would
probably change the channel
at halftime to catch the Cotton
Bowl. cae
Clemson fans may be think-
ing of seeing their Tigers play
on New Year’s Day, but the
chances are very remote. If
they can beat North Carolina
and Notre Dame, then there
might be a shot at the Sugar
Bowl against the Big Ten
loser. It is more likely Clem-
son will top the Tar Heels,
drop on to the Irish and end up
in the Gator Bowl

If Bill Dooley can get his
team to end Clemson’s seven--
game winning streak, then the
Tar Heels might well be in the
Gator Bowl.

Farrell has not forgotten how
he felt after Delaware, this
week’s opponent for the Wild-
cats, trounced his squad, 63-0,
last year.

“TI was shell-shocked,’ he
said. ‘‘We all were. On the
spot, I thought the mismatch
was as bad as the score. We
were really lost. But after
watching the film, I knew we
could have played better.”’

Even though the game with
Delaware was a disaster, Far-
rell does not label it as the
worst game one of his teams
have ever had. That honor
belongs to the 69-14 loss to
Lenior-Rhyne in 1975.

Those hard-core basketball
fans who watch the Wildcats
practice have no doubt been
wondering why freshman for-
ward Rich DeBenedetto has
not been practicing since last
Friday.

Coach Dave Pritchett has a
simple enough answer. DiBe-
nedotto is sick and has gone

home to be checked by family
doctors and get some rest.

“Rich will be back this term
and will be with the team for
the start of the season,’’
Pritchett said.

Both Atlanta and Denver
are doing far better this year
than was expected. Both
teams are tied for first place in
their division.

The luck can’t go on forever:

Any team who can get
shut-out by a Buffalo team
that turns around two weeks
later and gives up over 500
yards offense and 56 points to
the Seattle Seahawks, is not
play-off material. I do not
want to get Atlanta people
mad, but the Falcons look to
finish 5-9 in my book.

As far as the Broncos are
concerned, their schedule will
take them out of the post-
season picture. Having to
Play Baltimore, Pittsburgh,
and Dallas should end the fun
of the 1977 season for them.

Surging golf team
thwarts opponents

By MIKE KENNEDY
Staff Writer

The Davidson golf team
played four opponents the
past two days with smashing
success against three and the
fourth school pulling out a
squeaking victory over the
Cats.

Tuesday saw the golfers
walk over both Catawba and
Pfeiffer. The Cats, led by L.D.
Simmon’s 77, shot a 315 to
beat Catawba’s 327 and Pfeif-
fer 327.

The other scores for the four
man total were Bill baird’s 78,
Sollie Foy’s 79, and Scott
Gilmore’s 81.

Wednesday saw the link-
sters nudged by the highly

acclaimed (they won two tour-
naments this fall) UNCC gol-
fers, while walloping Win-
throp.

The 49ers, in unconcious
efforts, sank three putts of
thirty feet apiece on the last
green to shoot 309, over our
academically riddled golf
team’s 311.

Winthrop brought up the
very bottom with 336. Foy led
the Cats with a 76, Baird and
Simmons a 78, and Gilmore a
79.

The fall golf season drawing
to a close because of inclement
weather and imminent exams,
will see one more match with
the Duke Blue Devils, a
perennial ACC powerhouse, as
they swing by Salisbury.
