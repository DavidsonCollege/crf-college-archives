Israel, PLO sign historic agreement |

By Brett Marston ,

Archenemies Yasir Arafat,
Chairman of the Palestine Libera-
tion Organization (PLO), and
Yitzak Rabin, Prime Minister of
Israel, will meet in Washington
today to approve a new Palestin-
ian-Israeli peace accord in the most
dramatic show of good will in the
Middle East since the Camp David
meetings between Israel and Egypt
in 1978.

The agreement will provide
for Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza
strip and the West Bank city of
Jericho and marks the first step in
what may become the creation of a
separate Palestinian state.

The Israelis have occupied the
Gaza strip and the West Bank since
Rabin led the Israeli forces to vic-
tory in 1967.

The two men paved the way
for this historic meeting on Friday
as they formally recognized each

other’s existence.

“The Governmentof Israel has
decided to recognize the PLO as
the representative of the Palestin-
ian people and commence negotia-
tions with the PLO within the
Middle East peace process,” Rabin
wrote to Arafat on Friday.

Writing from PLO headquar-
ters in Tunis, Arafat asserted “the
right of the State of Israel to exist in
peace and security,” renounced the
use of violence, and pledged to
void the articles of the PLO charter
which call for the destruction of
Israel, :

The letters and the agreement
represent the fruit of several months
of secret, Norwegian-brokered ne-
gotiations between Israel and the
PLO.

Until recently, Israel had
vowed never to negotiate directly
with members of the PLO, who
have killed countless Israelis in

brutal terrorist attacks, including
the massacre of eleven members
of the Israeli Olympic team in
Munich in 1972.

Talks with local Palestinians
had stalled and extremist groupsin
the occupied territories and in Is-
rael were gaining influence when
the Norwegians came forward with
a proposal to act as a mediator in
discussions with the PLO.

The Israelis, seeing a chance
to’ save the peace process in the
Middle East, accepted the Norwe-
gian offer.

After alienating most of its
financial supporters in the Arab
world when it sided with Iraq in the
Gulf War, the PLO has run into
financial difficulties.

In addition, the 1987 outbreak
of the intifada, a spontaneous up-
rising of frustrated Palestinians in
the occupied territories, and the
rapid growth of several extremist

ery,

groups have challenged the PLO’s
claim to be the sole representative
of the Palestinian people.

Many commentators see
Arafat’s move as a final attempt to
gain support for the PLO and hold
on to his own dwindling political
authority.

Radical Palestinians, such as
the Iranian-backed group Hamas,
and Ahmed Jibril, leader of the
Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command, con-
demn Arafat’s dealings with Israel
and vow to continue using vio-
lence in the occupied territories.

Jibril hinted that Arafat will
soon be assassinated.

Israeli extremists, on the other

ILSEWHERE

hand, do not trust the Palestinians
and are opposed to Palestinian self-
rule. They are afraid that the Pales-
tinians will continue to try to de-
stroy Israel.

According to a poll quoted in
Newsweek, however, 53 percent
of the Israelis and 52.8 percent of
the Palestinians in the occupied
territories approve of the peace
accord.

Hands-on management in the White House
"Jack Kennedy came into the White house determined to dis-

mantle his Republican predecessor's rigid, formal staff organization in

favor of a spontaneous, flexible, hands-on management style. Thirty

years later Bill Clinton seems determined to do the same thing. He

would do well to remember what it got J.F.K. was the Bay of Pigs and

the Vietnam War."
-Richard Reeves in the September issue of
American Heritage

The war on waste
“While Vice president Gore's National Performance Review has
taken good ideas from its predecessors and introduced many of its
own, it uses a butter knife on ajob that requires a chain saw. The $108
billion in savings over five years proposed by the National perfor-
mance Review just won't mean much to a nation heading toward
complete bankruptcy at the rate of a billion dollars a day. Even if we
manage to save the $108 billion, that's.only 1.3% of federal spending
over five years. Thus, Mr. Gore's vaunted "reinventing" of govern-
mentis amonumental exaggeration, nomatter how many forklifts are
seen in the background."
-J. Peter Grace in the September 10 issue of The
Wall Street Journal. Mr. Grace was the author of
the Reagan Administration's study on government
efficiency.

Middle-East gamble

| “Theconflict between Israelis and Palestinians has not been kind
to optimists and idealists. It has been a long and bitter triumph of
experience over hope. And yet its costs have been too great to permit
either Israelis or Palestinians to subside into fatalism. For this reason,
the agreement between Israel and the PLO worked out discreetly in
Oslo, while the movers and the shakers in Washington believed that
the action was [in the U.S. Capitol], is already a momentous achieve-
ment, and a little hard to believe."

"Now we can't bring ourselves to make fun of the first daughter.
Especially since some of us have been going through an awkward
adolescent stage for nearly four decades. But we can say: "Damn it,
Hillary, quit fussing with your hair and do something about
Chelsea's...And, speaking of coiffures, Jimmy Carter never in his life
| got a haircut that cost more than $2.50, if appearances are anything to
go by."

why Jimmy Carter was a better president than Bill
Clinton" in the September issue of The American

Analysis from the Dean Rusk Program —
Japan faces a complete upheaval

By Lee Pennington

Japanese political activity has
asubstantial impact on our histori-
cal and economic view of the mod-
ern world.

The modern Japanese politi-
cal system is an organicoutgrowth
of American policy towards Japan

(and Cold Warcontainment policy) —

following World War II. The
Americans drafted Japan’s post-
war constitution, structured the
economy, and selected the pattern
of democratic, pluralistic politics.

However, until recently, the
political-economic system has re-
mainedaself-preserving entity, led
by the Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) during its 38 year-long mo-
nopoly in the Japanese Diet.
There’s beenan eclipse in the Land
of the Rising Sun.

Like the United States, Japan
has a multi-party political system
and a complex arrangement of re-
gional representation in a legisla-
tive assembly. Unlike the U.S.,
Japan has been governed by asingle
party, rather than through the spar-
ring of two opposition parties.

This past su , aS aconse-
quence of numerous political scan-
dals and charges of corruption, the
LDP prime minister dissolved the
Diet and called for new elections.
(This would be the equivalent of
the Speaker of the House of Repre-
sentatives telling all the members
to go home and have new elections
because they are all too corrupt.)

Such activity is the norm for
Japanese politics, and it usually
ends up with the Diet members
making a lot of promises to clean
up their act before being reelected.
Politics continue as usual.

This year a coalition of seven
minor political parties decided that
38 years of LDP control is enough.
Anon-LDP coalition now controls
the Diet, although the LDP still

. Maintains the majority of seats.

The election of a new prime
minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, was
a difficult decision for a coalition
consisting of such diverse mem-

. bers asthe Japanese Socialist Party

and Komeito, a Buddhist-based
party. This coalition of seven mi-

nor political parties was formed
solely for the purpose of seeking to
deny the LDP a role in the new
government.

The potential impact of anew
focus in political behavior has rel-
evance to the historical and eco-
nomic standing of Japan in the
world order.

The Hosokawa government —
for the first time in post-war his-
tory — has admitted that mistakes
were made by the Japanese during
World War II.

Such an acknowledgment is a
comfort for Japan’s Asian neigh-
bors, yet it also tells the Japanese
people that this non-LDP govern-
ment is serious in its aims of re-
forming the political system. The
Hosokawa government’s move-
ment in such a direction denotes

.the import of the potential for

change.

Economically, the new gov-
ernment may be better able to re-
duce the escalating gap between
the US dollar and the Japanese

yen, a source of conflict between
the two governments.

If the Japanese do decide to
increase interference in economic
policy, the US may see improved
relations with Japan in regard to
the trade deficit and market agree-
ments.

Politics concern the play of
interest against interest and power
against power. While the potential
for reform has been laid out, the
fulfilling of such a goal remains to
be seen.

How long will these seven
members of the coalition govern-
ment put their own objectives on
the back burner?

How stable will this non-LDP
government be among Japan’s
peers in the international order?
How satisfied will the Japanese
electorate be with Hosokawa’s
government?

The answers to these ques-
tions will determine whether or
not the LDP will come back in the
way of the rising sun.
