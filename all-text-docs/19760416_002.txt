By BILL BARNES
News Editor

Five faculty members have
been appointed to posts within
the Davidson College Center
for Honors Studies. *

These include Associate
Professor of English Charles
L. Cornwell, Associate Profes-
sor of German. Erich O.
Wrutck, Academic Vice Presi-
dent Frontis W. Johnston,
Assistant Professor of Psych-
ology Edward L. Palmer, and
Instructor of Political Science
Joseph D. Retzer.

The new members will re-
place Professor of English
Frank W. Bliss, Associate
Professor of English J. Gill
Holland, Professor of Econo-
mics Ernest F. Patterson.

Dean of the Honors Center
Robert L. Avinger indicated
that each of the faculty and
students of the Honors Center
would be to some extent
involved in a program in
American Studies. This Avin-
ger considers the unifying
factor in the Center’s 1976-77
curriculum.

Avinger feels that ‘‘there

should be a common ground,
something that each student
and faculty: member can tap
into that will provide for a
common interest.
—“What we're trying to do is’
to order the seminars and
tutorials around a rather
broad theme,”’ said Avinger.

The Center, however, will
not be limited in scope, ac-
cording to Avinger. He
stressed that ‘‘the Center is
still and will continue to be an
opportunity for students to
pursue special interests, in
many cases Interdisciplinary
studies, through special prog-
rams.

“We are program oriented,”
said Avinger.

Each of the new Center
faculty members will contri-
bute for students to pursue
bute to the overall program in
American Studies during
1976-77.

This program, according to
Avinger, was put together
partly under pressure--Avin-
ger was appointed Dean of the
Center in March and the
Program begins in September.

However, Avinger also be-
lieves that the program will be
of value. He pointed out that
“American Studies’’ label co-
vers abroad range of topics
Avinger feels that each mem-
ber of the Center will find
some aspect of the program to
participate in.

Avinger was trained in field
closely related to American
Studies and was has been
interested in a program of this
sort for some time.

Avinger said that there
have been difficulties in plan-
ning next year’s Center pro-
grams. ‘‘We have several de-
partments,’’ he said, ‘‘and
would like support in other

“Even so, there are possibi-

Previously, the faculty
alone has directed the Artist

cations from various sources
have been unpredictable.

assistant director. “‘A student
could handle most of the
work,”’ he said.

‘Now, the program we have
is as big as the building we
work in. We don’t have the
know-how among students to
handle the complexities of
programming,’’ said
Goodhouse.

‘‘The appointment of this
new assistant director is a
critical juncture. We need to
be careful with who we hire
and how we analyze their skills
and ability to work with
people. A good assistant can
‘be a great benefit to David-
son’s program,” he said. ___

Goodhouse stressed know-

ledge of the whole field of
union programming as neces-
sary qualifications of an
assistant director.

‘‘This includes: contacts;"

programming skills, such as
booking, publicity, production
of major events like an artist
series, and technical work;
box-office management; and
budgetary-monetary _ skills,’
he said.

Goodhouse said that he
attended the A.C.U.-I.
convention and interviewed
some 45 applicants for the job.
Twelve of these 45 were called
back for second interviews.

The Union Board Executive
Committee is now reading the
interviews of these 12 people,

and will bring the top five
candidates to Davidson for
further interviews.

Goodhouse added that the
ultimate decision was Smith’s.

According to the American Bar Association (A.B.A.),
enrollment of first-year law students in A.B.A. approved
law schools has dropped for the first time in seven years.

In the 156 A.B.A. accredited law schools, the number of
enrolled first year students dropped by 182, from 38,074 in
the Fall of 1974 to 37,892 in the Fall of 1975. This is the
first such decrease since 1968. The A.B.A. also reported a

a drop in the number of new law school openings.

Law schools are also experiencing a decline in the
quality of applicants. Mean test scores on the Law School
Admissions Test dropped from 1973-74 to 1974-75.

‘‘Many law schools experienced a decrease in the total
number of applicants who met the given admission criteria
in each law school,” said James White, A.B.A. consultant

‘Additionally, a number of law schools experienced a
greater number of ‘no shows’ in their first choice of

Fund has allocated $5,000 of
its budget to the Artist Series,

“In the past, money hasn’t
been appropriated to the Art-
ist Series until April or May,’
commented Union President
Karl E. Goodhouse.

MBy that time many of the
artists and groups we want are
booked or are asking for top
dollar,’’ said Goodhouse.

- “With this annual sum of

$12,000 we can begin early
locating and bargaining with
the people we want.

ABecause this new set up
has just been approved, the
results may not be as evident
next year. The 1977-78 school
year will be the real test,” said
Goodhouse.

Smith said that co-curricu-

Union’s budget’s money next
year.

. “With good planning the
students have learned to make
this social money go further,
“and we can do more things in
that area with the same
amount of money.

| “By increasing the co-curri-
cular allocation, the Union
Board is emphasizing its belief
that the co-curricular activi-
ties are also an important part
of the college experience,”’
Smith said.
