Davidsonian Action is

Faaantastic.

Davidsonian Fever. Catch it.

Winning Again

Junior Linsey Mills’ interception and consequent retum
fora touchdownin last week’s football game against Johnston
C. Smith summarized the manner in which Davidson football
and all other fall sports are headed: the other way. The
Wildcats 17-7 victory over ¢rosstown rival Smith marked the
first time in ten years that Davidson has won two consecutive
games.

But football isn’t the only team that is winning. Wednes-
day’s victory by the soccer team over fourteenth ranked Duke
at Durham was proclaimed by Coach Slagle tobe “the biggest
victory” ever. The team is currently ranked fifth in the South
and are certain to move up after this week’s win. oe

The record of the women’s volleyball team is an impres-
sive 10-1, and the field hockey team crushed Roanake College
7-0 last Saturday to bring their record to 3-1. Women’s cross-
country placed five of its runners in the topeight in last week’s
meet at the Carson-Newman’s invitational.

Amidst conference changes that are taking place around
our area, it is comforting to know that Davidson has finally
found its niche in athletics. And credit should deservingly go
to our new Athletic Director Terry Holland and student-
athletes. Yes, Davidson’s winning again.

Korner Pub Exhibits Racism

To the Editors:

The Komer Pubhas been
an integral part of the social
life here at Davidson for
many years. Students often
make the short trip to Mt.
Mourncon the weekends and
especially during the weck
to relax with a game of pool
anda few mugs of beer. The
bar depends on the entire
Davidson student body,
regardless of gender or fra-
ternal association, for a

surprising percentage, of its ,
business cight months outof,,

the year. Despite this de-
pendence, the owncrs of the
Pub are not extremely fond
(to be euphemistic) of cer-
tain members of the college
community on the basis of
their race. Several students
have even been denied serv-
ice and asked to leave be-
cause they did not suit the
owners’ standards. This
adherence to ideals which
are by some standards radi-
cally conservative, and by
otherscompletely backward,

‘is, common. knowledge to

many who frequent the es-

tablishment.
How ironic it is that ata

"school in which weare taught

to be open minded, so many
of us can knowingly. give
financial support to an insti-
tution which fosters such a
narrow view of the world. I
would hope thatin the future
we would keep this paradox
in mind when we’re looking
for somewhere to go to have
a good time.

Sincerely,

KIRBY SHEALY 93.

Every time an issue
comes upinS.G.A. this year
it seems the Physical Plant
Director Bob Collins is
behind it somewhcre. This
is the guy who’s behind the
ever-popular “
from the ceiling loft rule.”
This is the guy who wants to
renovate Patterson Court but
isn’t quite sure where to put
the inhabitants of the P.C.A.
apartments during renova-
tion, This is the guy who
created the wonderful new
parking lot but forgot to
install lights.

This may even be the
guy who is rumored to be
behind the recent prolifera-
tion of towing vehicles on
campus. I figure he’s either
trying to tow 1200 cars in
two months so he’ Il win the
microwave (1500 and he’s
got a 25 inch color t.v.), or
he’s saving up to buy a tow
truck of his own.

Being anew member of
our Davidson community
Mr. Collins must, like most

‘three-feet —

rookics, feel a need to rock
the boat. And baby, it’srock-
ing. However, (and this may
come as a shock given my
tone to this point) I think
we've got lo give the guy a
break. He’s got some good
points. If lofts really are a
fire hazard when they’re less
than three fect from the ccil-
ing (which is certainly argu-
able) then there should be a
new policy. And the court
houses need’ renovating
worse than the Parthenon.

Hopefully he’ll be able

to finda place for the inhabi- '

tants to stay, especially since
there’s so much room in the
dorms this year. I also know
that he has been working
hardonthe lighting situation,
We’ve actually got a com-
parison shopper in the physi-
cal plantthis year. Instead of
buying expensive lightpolls,
the physical plantis making
there own. So, that’s why
we're still waiting for lights,
(after all, we’ve only been
waiting for campus lighting

since Edison)
Furthermore, the only
reasoneveryone’ssomilfed
about the towing rules is
because they were never

_enforced before. I think Mr.

Collins is just trying to scare
us. Itreminds meofastory I’
learncd in psychology 101.
This was a little story about
a baby elephant.

The baby elephanthada .
big chain around his leg and
try and try as he might, he
couldn’t break that chain.
When the baby elephant
grew up to be a big strong
elcphant he nevereven tried
to break that chain becuase
he learned when he was
young that he couldn’t do it.
So the moral of this analogy
must be that Mr. Collins is
conditioning us to be good
boys and girls and park our
cars where we're supposed
to. But I do think he’s going
lo case up eventually, (Be
nice Bob, we're begging)

All-in-all, he’s doing a
good job.
