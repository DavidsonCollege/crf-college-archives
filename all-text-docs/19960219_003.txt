PARTNERS IN CONSTRUCTION

Community Service Coordinator Catherine Turner (right), co-chairperson of the Wildcat
Habitat Committee, consults with Pat Millen at the Habitat site. Millen and his wife, Eileen
Keely of the development office, were chosen as the Jetton’s family partners. They will
work with the Jettons during and after the construction of their home.

TheWildcat Habitat Com-
mittee is hoping for good weather.
Frequent precipitation since
Christmas has kept the ground
too wet to begin digging founda-
tion footings at the site on
Westside Terrace, where the
group will build a home for the
Jetton family.

The land has been cleared
and workers are ready, but they
must wait until the land driés for
construction to move into full
gear. “Once the foundation is
poured, we’ll’ become building
maniacs,’*said Katherine Cooke,

volunteer subcommittee chairper-
son.

Meanwhile, the committee is
recruiting volunteers and raising
money. In honor of Valentine’s
Day, students signed up last week
to work with their Valentine — or
with just a friend — this coming
Saturday, Feb. 24 (weather per-
mitting!).

Volunteers are still needed for
many different aspects of the
project, and applications may- be
picked up in the Union pit and in
the library. Construction days are
planned for Thursday afternoons

and all day Saturdays.
Fundraising efforts have
been going extremely well. More
*than $27,000 has been raised,
which is close to the monetary
goal of $30,000. This will be
supplemented by $10,000 of in-
kind donations. This week,
“Hammerhead” fundraisers will
be continuing the campaign by
contacting students: who have
recently returned from abroad.

Tuition will rise
again for 1996-
‘97 school year

By Kirsten RECKNAGEL
Assistant News Editor

All parents of Davidson stu-
dents received word last week of
the rising cost of a Davidson edu-
cation for the ‘96-‘97 school year.

In a letter written last Mon-
day, College President John
Kuykendall related results of the
Davidson Board of Trustees’ re-
cent approval of next year’s bud-

_ get and how budget decisions will

affect the cost of tuition and other
fees.

Although the cost of attend-
ing Davidson will increase, Presi-
dent Kuykendall writes that, “this
is the fifth year in which we have
been able to reduce the percentage
rate of growth ... This year’s per-
centage increase is the lowest in21
years at Davidson.”

Tuition and fees account for
roughly two thirds of Davidson’s
projected revenues, while the
College’s endowment constitutes
the next largest share, at 16%.

Accounting for about 40% of
projected expenses, Academic Af-
fairs, which includes faculty sala-
ries, makes up the largest category

of expenditures. ‘~" ’
“ 'Kiiykendall writes that “a sub-" “ei

stantial portion of our increase in
revenues for this year will be di-

rected to enhancement of compen-
sation for Davidson faculty and
staff,” an area in which “Davidson
lags significantly behind its peer
institutions.” |

Following Academic Affairs,
distribution of financial aid consti-
tutes 22% of Davidson’s projected
expenses. :

Although growing numbers of
schools of comparable size and
quality to Davidson are deciding
to sacrifice financial aid in the
course of budget appropriations,
such action does not lie in
Davidson’s future. Decreasing fi-
nancial aid “would be impossible
unless Davidson were to change
its core value system,” says Vice
President for Business and Finance,
Robert Norfleet.

The future of one area of the
budget seems especially positive,
however...

Although the size of
Davidson’s endowment typically
falls between 20 - 30% of endow-
ments of similar institutions, it has
seen recent growth and tremen-
dous returns on investment. Its
current market value is.$163 mil-
lion.

Says Norfleet; “The ’ more the
take pressure off students and their
families.”

Nominees wait to hear about Watson Scholarhip

Four students propose topics from The Beatles to the banks of Bangladesh

By ANN HATFIELD
Staff Writer

An award that offers virtually
limitless oportunities, the Watson
Fellowship allows “college gradu-
ates of exceptional promise to en-
gage ina year of independent study
and travel abroad following gradu-
ation.”

After proposing projects of
their choice, the Watson Founda-
tion awards national nominees a
$16,000 grant to go abroad and
enact their proposals.

From a pool of over 40 pro-
posals, 24 Davidson students were
interviewed by the Davidson se-
lection committee. Made up of
Dean Shandley, faculty members,
and two students, the committee
nominated four seniors for the pres-
tigious Watson Fellowship.

Davidson seniors Eric
Collings, Mandy Curtis, Jeni

Hankins, and Aigool Khalikov-

were selected to advance to the
national pool of nominees. This
year’s Davidson nominees repre-
sent a variety of interests and pro-
pose four unique projects.
‘Democracy in Asia:
The Soviet Void
Anentirely different region of
the world appeals to Eric Collings.
He developed an interest in the
former Soviet Union after spend-

ing his junior year in Kazakhastan,
Asia.
Collings says that he “wants

‘to study the attitudes of four Asian

republics toward democracy and
market economics after the fall of
the Soviet-Union.” Focusing his
research on the republics of
Kazakhstan,Uzbekistan,
Turkmenistan, and Kirghiszia, he
describes his proposed course of
study as “political science partici-
pant observation in central Asia.”
He adds, “Everyone assumed
that after the fall of the Soviet
Union, democracy would take over.
In reality, these countries have
moved toward authoritarianism. I
want to know what factors contrib-
ute to the emergence of authoritar-
ian leaders as opposed to demo-
cratic leaders.”
Journalism in Latin America
English major-Mandy Curtis
hopes to study female journalists
and the alternative press in Latin
America. Says Curtis, “I'm inter-
ested in how women journalists of
the official and alternative press

use journalism as a means of~

achieving political and social
change.”

Curtis is interesed in how
women who work for feminist pub-
lications address controversial is-
sues such as sexism, rape, domes-

tic violence, abortion, and divorce
as a way of bringing about change
for women in Latin America,
“As a journalist, I realize the
value and the power of the printed
word as a reflection of cultural
ideals. I see journalism as a means
for communicating, sharing ideas,
shaping and molding perspectives
and attitudes, perpetuating tradi-
tion or instigating change, and cre-
ating history and a kind of cultural

reality.” Curtis proposes to study

in Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and
Nicaragua.
East Meets West: American
Icons Abroad

Jeni Hankins wants to put her
Classical Political Philosophy ma-
jor to use by examining religious
and popular devotional icons. She

titles her proposal “Stars and Saints
— Fans and the Faithful” and plans
to travel to Western Europe, Ja-
pan, and Russia to study the influ-
ence of Elvis Presley, Marilyn
Monroe, Jim Morrison and the
Beatles.

Hankins explains, “each re-
gion represents a different attitude.
In Western Europe, I want to study
western icons in the West; in Ja-
pan, western icons adopted by the
East; and Russia, a kind of East
meets West.”

Economics in the Third World:
Search for a Solution

Economics/Political Science
major Aigool Khalikov proposes
to study “microlending” in
Bangladesh, Indonesia, India, and
Malawi. She describes this con-

cept “as a phenomenon in eco-
nomic development in which
groups provide credit for small
business ventures.”

She cites the success of
Bangladesh’s Grameen Bank ex-
plaining that in its 20 year span, it
has made a profit and helped many

people to rise above the poverty

line.

Khalikov says that she “wants
to see why the principle of
microlending is viable and how it
is changing the lives of people and
their communities.” She believes
that “when applied ona large scale,
bank microlending will alleviate a
lot of problems.”

Applicants. will be notified of
the Watson Foundation’s decisions
March 15.
