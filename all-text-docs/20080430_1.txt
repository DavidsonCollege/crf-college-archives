Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity
was tried before the Patterson
Court Judiciary Board for hazing
new members over three months
after the incident occurred on Self
Selection night.

The trial began with opening
statements from Sig Ep President
Chris Vincoli ’09 and Student
Solicitor Neely Meeks ’09 before a
room packed with students present
to support the fraternity.

Meeks shared that the fraternity
had been accused of hazing by
Patterson Court Advisor Cheyenne
Schultz, Director of Housing Dean
Perillo and Area Coordinator
Sabrina Brown. Davidson College
defines hazing as compromising
the dignity of the individual, and
Schultz found that the atmosphere
that the Sig Ep brothers had creat-
ed for their pledges on Self
Selection night was intimidating
and demeaning.

Additionally, Schultz found that
Sig Ep had violated Article 18 of
the Patterson Court New Member
Bill of Rights, which states that fra-
ternities and eating houses may not
prohibit its members from speak-
ing.

Schultz, Perillo and Brown were
all absent from the trial, but Meeks

read a statement from Schultz
about the incident, in which
Schultz described when she,
Brown and Perillo passed by the
Sig Ep house at roughly 7 p.m. that
night and witnessed the pledges
lined up in a row outside of the
house in complete silence. She
continued that the lights were
turned off inside of the house and
that the brothers were yelling at the
pledges from inside, including som
obscenities. Schultz was greatly
disturbed by the fact that, accord-
ing to her, a brother had yelled at
the pledges that “there are 25 of
you and only 24 getting in,” which
would imply that one pledge would
not be. initiated into the fraternity.
Also, according to Schultz, a shirt-
less pledge was yelled at to put his
shirt back on.

Schultz also asserted that broth-
ers were throwing objects at the
pledges from inside the house.
Brown stated that she saw a broth-
er throwing an apple at the pledges
and that it nearly hit them.

Schultz added that she was
greatly disappointed in the fraterni-
ty because she is “one of Sig Ep’s
greatest fans,” but that it “broke her
heart” when she witnessed “what
had taken place during pledging.”
Schultz, a strong opponent of haz-
ing, saw Sig Ep’s actions during

Students frolic before final exams

Kate KELLY
News Editor

For Davidson students and alum-
ni, this past weekend was full of
high-spirited fun and of course
plenty of frolicking. The carefully
chosen words of last Wednesday’s
social calendar, “remember this
weekend is a marathon, not a
sprint,” offered sage advice regard-
ing the festivities.

By Friday night, it wasn’t hard to
tell that frolics were in full swing
as the all-too-familiar eau de
Patterson Court, a mixture of beer,
sweat and poor life decisions, was
detectable from as far away as Belk
Dormitory.

As a freshman experiencing
Spring Frolics for the first time, I
was excited to see Davidson stu-
dents taking a break from work for
once. Andrew Wilkins *11 elabo-

rated on the bizarre affect that
Spring Frolics had on campus, stat-
ing, “I heard an alumni say ‘this is
the one time a year that Davidson
looks like a normal college cam-
pus’... minus the bouncy things.”

Right before crunch-time,
Davidson students took time out to
kick back, relax and realize that
college is worth enjoying.

The weekend was enjoyed by
both students and alumni as Spring
Frolics coincided with Alumni
Weekend.

The alumni events allowed for-
mer students to reunite and remi-
nisce while frolicking with current
students. The alumni’s presence
added excitement to campus as
Court bonding transcended genera-
tions, proving that a Davidson
Court party will always be a
Davidson Court party.

For some students, however, the

alumni’s presence on the court (and _
specifically that of their children)
was a little disconcerting.

“YT understand they want to be a
part of their school, but I feet like
it’s a little strange and borderline
irresponsible to have their young
children around fraternities where
almost everyone has been drinking
excessively,” Wilkins said.

Despite the focus on partying
this past weekend, there was only
one fire call to the Pi Kappa Alpha
house in response to an alarm.
There were no medical calls
received in spite of the slip-and-
slides and bouncing fun times.

Students did however experience
some unique events due to exces-
sive partying. Katie Miller ’10 nar-
rates her favorite Spring Frolics
moment: “Best Commons meal I
have ever experienced. It seemed

Presidential stamp of approval

During freshman orientation this
year, Davidson employees resorted
to setting up traps in front of the
President’s house—not to keep out
too-eager freshmen and their par-
ents, but the skunks that sprayed
his dog, Chelsea,, twice. Although
the traps only succeeded in catch-
ing a solitary raccoon, President
Ross assured us he has since devel-
oped a successful strategy for
keeping his dog out of stink’s way.

The impending graduation of the
Class of 2008 marks another con-
clusion, Tom Ross’s first year as
president of Davidson College. We
thought this an appropriate time to
recognize what has been a tumul-
tuous and ambitious first year.

The Davidsonian spoke to
President Ross on Monday regard-
ing his personal thoughts on this

year. First, he was asked of what
he was proud from the year. His
impressive initial response fol-
lowed: “The sense of community is
at as high of a level as Davidson
has ever seen.” He cited such fac-
tors as, of course, the exhilarating
basketball season, open and frank
student discussion of issues on
campus and what he considers the
community’s growth and matura-
tion over the course of the year. He

q °

also witnessed an evolution of ini-
tiatives like Rally for Change,
which impact the campus positive-
ly.
The Class of 2008 will be the
first to graduate with Tom Ross’s
signature on their diplomas, a fact
of which Ross is proud. At the
Senior Banquet held in Vail
Commons last week, Ross felt
emotional looking at the crowd of
Seniors, with whom he has built
numerous relationships. He also
feels that this year has allowed him
to begin building relationships with
the faculty, whom he hopes has
learned to trust him to do what’s
right while still encouraging com-
munication.

Ross hopes to continue develop-
ing these relationships, as well as
work even harder to maintain his
focus on attending campus events
and forums. Davidson as a college
