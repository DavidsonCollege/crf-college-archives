Expanding Davidson

Faces Housing Crisis |

The housing shortage in Da-
vidson, which has posed prob-
lems in the past, appears to be
more critical this year than ever
before.

With the advent of hundreds
of workers who will be hired by
the new General Time Corpora-
tion factory, there could be a
great increase in the population
of Davidson, which is now just
under 3,000 including students.
There are simply no houses to
meet this need and most of the
new workers will have to live
outside Davidson.

“Davidson is typical of a lot

of small towns,’’ commented
Robert A. Currie, college treas-
urer and business manager.

“There is no one to meet the
need for new houses. Most peo-
ple here like to handle their
own construction.

“It is hard to find rental hous-
es, though, even in Charlotte,”
he continued. ‘‘And the college
is certainly not in the business
of building houses to rent to any-
one. We have enough trouble
providing for all the faculty. The
more houses others rent, the
tighter it is on us.”

In elaborating on the faculty

Richardson
introduced

The Richardson scholars intro-
duced themselves to the student
body in chapel Tuesday.

Each student spoke briefly on
his impressions of the United
States and on his country. The
scholars were impressed by
computer dating, Americans’
warmth and understanding for
tourists and the immense size
of the country.

The students also commented
favorably on Davidson's student-
professor relationships. Objec-
tions to Davidson included the
lack of girls on campus and. the
school's drinking policy.

The students made a few re-
marks on their country’s edu-
cational, economic and political
position.

Of the 14 foreign students 12
are on full Richardson scholar-
ships, which were established
in 1958. The program was orig-
inally directed by the late Dr.
Bradley Thompson. Now, Dr.
Jobn D. Kelton is.serving .as ad-
visor for the students.

The foreign students are Mi-
chael Gwilyn and Roger Ward
from .Great Britain, Henri Dar-
del and Francis Gayte from
France, Takehiko Yokoseki and
Susumo Takebe from Japan and

Discrepancy Discussed
In Student Pay Rates

Questions have plagued the
instigation of the new federally.
supported work-study program at
Davidson.

The main controversy con-
cerns the varying pay rates now
received by student employees.
Holders of work-study jobs are

being paid $1.25 an hour, while’

those employed in regular jobs
. receive $1.00 an hour.

Ian explaining these discrepan-
cles, H. Edmunds White, direc-
tor of admissions and financial
aid, pointed out several reasons
for the difference between pay
tates.

First, White noted, under. the

“We wish that some private

shortage, especially by provid-
ing nicer units for the married
students, but there appears to
be little chance for this in the
foreseeable future,” Currie
said.

In other business, Bill Watson
reported on the scuba lessons,
saying that William Wolff, an
instructor from Charlotte, would
handle the lessons held in the
college pool. After initial begin-
ners’ lessons, long-range plans
call for proposed field trips.

The program has been approv-
ed by Dr. Tom Scott. athletic
director, and Wolff will handle

dent with financial need that has
not been met in other ways.

Asked about the possibility of
raising the rate of pay for regu-
lar jobs, he said that due to the
addition of the work-study pro-
gram, the college has already
been able to grant, in most
cases, a 334% per cent :acrease
over last year, but there were
no plans for a further increase
in the near future.

Peter Nicholls Explains
Textbook Shortage

As classses resumed this year,
many students found that they
would be sharing textbooks fur
an indefinite period of time.

Peter Nicholls, manager of
the Student Store, blamed the
textbook shortage on both a na-
tionwide shortage and the prob-
lem of deciding how many books
to order for each subject.

“Recent government expan-
sion of funds into education,”
stated Nicholls, “‘has led to the
purchase of more new editions.
Cotleges which before could af-
ford only older editions or sec-
ond-hand books will no longer
accept these books because of
the government funds.”

Nicholls indicated that pub-
lishers and book binders have
found themselves ‘pressed to keep
up their orders, and a large in-
crease in the use of paperbacks
in recent years has heightened
the problem of which books the
publisher should stock.

Because of this shortage of
textbooks, Davidson professors
had to submit orders for books
before registration. Larger en-
roliment than the professors ex-
pected in some classes resulted

ton. They explained several tra-
ditional activities and suggested
other successful activities used
by past freshmen classes, tell-
ing the council that its creative
efforts will determine the suc-
cess or failure of the freshman
year at Davidson.

Before adjourning the meet-
ing, Rikard listed the six com-
mittees that will function within
the Freshman Council this year.
The committees are the social
committee, transportation com-
mittee, orientation evaluation
committee, athletic committee,
rush committee and Freshman
Parent’s Day committee.

Rikard also read dates per
taining to freshman activities.
He noted that the Freshman-
Sophomore Field Day will be
held Oct. 26 and that Freshman
Parent's Day will be Nov. 12.

Nicholis stated that shipments
of books within the past week
have alleviated much of the
problem, but several orders re-
main unfilled.

Student fees will be $18 for the
one month course with two les-
sons a week. Students will be
responsible for their own masks,
flippers and snorkel.

Watson said that there will be
a meeting Tuesday for all stu-
dents interested in the course at
7 p.m. in the Green Room of
the Union. Classes willl probab-
ly begin Thursday, according to
Wolff.

FIELD TRIP

Wolff plans to have a field
trip after the course is over at
a 40-50 foot deep spring near
Statesville if weather permits.
If the lessons are continued
throughout the year, another
field trip wil! be held in the
spring.

Wolff formerly taught a scuba
class here in 1962, and now
teaches at the Charlotte YWCA.

Watson also reported that he
hopes to have a judo-karati ex-
pert come to Davidson for a
similar program.

SUNDAY CLOSING

.In reply to many student com-
plaints about the Nbrary being
closed on Sundays, the council
approved 4 resolution drawn up
by Tom Earnhardt calling for
the library to remain open from
2 p.m. until 12 midnight on Sun-
days.

Thus far this year the library
has been closed from 5 p.m. un-
til 8:30 p.m. during the previ-

Rotary Scholarship
Goes To Carroll

Don Carroll, a senior from
Scottsville, Va., has recently
been granted a Rotary scholar-
ship to further his study in his-
tory next year at St. Andrew’s
University in Scotland.

Rach year a number of Rotary
scholarships for study abroad
are granted to graduate students.
Although there are no limitations
as to subject majors, applica-
tion for these fellowships must
be filed during the junior year
of college.

Currently there are three Da-
vidson alumni, all June gradu-
ates, studying abroad on Rotary
scholarships: John Callender,
now studying in Scotland; Deck-
er Faw, now studying in Eng-
land; and Bill Logan, now study-
ing in Australia,

Many Rotary scholarships are
granted to foreign students for
study in the United States. This
year one of the Richardson
scholars, Ahmet Saracoglu of
Turkey, also holds a Rotary
scholarship.

Earnhardt also investigated
the possibility of keeping the
game room in the Union open
on Sundays, pointing out that a
“pool ball is just as good as a
basketball,""* Earnhardt said.
that if sfudents can play tennis,
handball and basketball on Sun-
days, there is no reason to keep
the game room closed.

According to Earnhardt, Tom
Covington. assistant director of
the Union, will attempt to get
the game room open if this can
be arranged.

SPOT BOX

The student-wide spot box,
proposed by Bill Watson last
week, was again discussed. It
was noted that some faculty
members may attempt to veto
the. program, and the council
agreed that it would be best to
get a representative sample as
to initial faculty reaction con-
cerning the spot box.

Bill Rikard expressed that,
“realistically, a lot of students
aren't in favor of the program.
Some students aren't too enthu-
Siastic about having ' professors
make up new tests."

Watson answered that the
“whole idea of college is to get
an education, not spot a review
cold" and estimated that about
one-half the faculty would offer
spots.

Watson’s estimate was chal-
lenged by Mike Powell.

In other business, Julian Pros-
ser proposed that the council
press the faculty for an ‘expan-
sica of several departments, no-
tably the Political Sclence De-
partment. Prosser reported that
this department has only two
professors for the third most

‘heavily-majored department at

Davidson.

Prosser and the council's
Academic Scheduling Commit-
tee plan to discuss the matter
with Dr. Frontis W. Johnston,
dean of the faculty.

Finally, Prosser announced
that a new member of the Fine
Arts and Lecture Committee
needs to be chosen to replace
Bruce Hyslop, who transferred
to Columbia University.

Monday.

Hill, chairman of the Department of
Religion at the University of North Caro-

lina at Chapel Hill,

ointed out that stu-

dents are trustees of the college in four

ways.

“First, we faculty members turn over
our resources and skill to you. This is a

gift entrusted to you.

“Fourth, you are trustees

“Second, you are responsible for the
college. You may give to it what you
will, mold, shape and direct it. You are
trustees of our society's redemption.

“The third role you sustain is as trus-
tees of the corporate life of the college.
Everything about the college affects you.
You live with an honor system here. The
presence or absence of an honor system
and the way it operates says a good deal

about a school.

morality—your personal integrity. Make

sure your morality is high
line with your work. Morali
too low,” Hill said.

“The foulest word in the English lan-
guage is not a four-letter word. The foul-

est word in the English language is ‘nig-
ger’ and comparable words,” Hill re-
marked in explaining how students are
strustees of the personal morality.

In further defining the role of
trustees, Hill defined four types
of student subcultures.

The ‘‘fun culture" is made up
of students out to make friends
and have a good time. The ‘‘vo-
cational’ group is principally
interested in leamming how to
make a living.

.The “‘intellectual’’ group lives
in an issue-oriented world. The
“social activist” group agitates
for change.

“Each sub-culture ought to
challenge the others,’’ Hill com-
mented. “They can complement
each other.”

The fun culture can bring a
carefree atmosphere to the cam-
pus. The vocational culture can
point out serious aspects of col-
lege life. The intellectuals are
extremely necessary because we
live in a rationalistic world. The
activists can make a great con-
tribution to student life, Hill
said.

“The student body should have
a role in the formation of aca-
demic policy. You have a re-
sponsibility to ask about aca-
demic policy."’ he continued.

“I den't know if there is a tide
of alienation here. This is the
difference between what you do
and what you say

“It is deplorable that many
students sit only halfway through
classes. You are responsible not
only to the classroom, but for it.
Avoid the posture of pacivity,”’

New

Hill emphasized.

“Trusteeship has a way of be-
ing treated as an honorary in-
stitution. We fa¢ulty ‘sometimes
don't believe you are trustees.
You don't either.

“I grow depressed with stu-
dents saying, ‘O. K., prof, tell
me how things are.’ I perfer vio-
lence to pacivity. Don't defer to,
don’t adulate the professor. He
doesn't deserve it,” Hill said.

Educational institutions, he
continued, are being looked to
as Solvers of many problems in
society. Society looks to the col-
lege. The government rates edu-

cation second only to national
defense in importance to the
country.

“However, I am wary of those
who say education is a panacea
for human problems," Hill re-
marked.

“You had to come to college. ~
In a sense, you were required to
come. But what else in society
holds such high .promise?" he
queried. .

“Remember Churchill's re-
sponse when he became Prime
Minister. He was relieved, be-
cause this was the responsibil-
ity he wanted,’ Hill concluded.

Computer Is Compiling
Cut List For Chapel

“A cut stands as a cut.”
stressed Gene Shepherd, head of
the chapel monitors, According
to Shepherd, there will be no
disputing a monitor’s word con-
cerning the assignment of a
cut.

Shepherd adds that the rules
on sleeping and reading in chap-
el are in the Student Body Reg-

ulations. Enforcement is no dif-

ferent than in previous years.
He said that insteaa of cut
books, lists of cuts will be post-
ed this year, probably on Wed-
nesdays.
This year the college comput-
er is being employed to help

compile cut lists. Joe Friebele, -

one of several students who help
with programming the computer,
says the computer -will help re-
duce the time required to record
assembly cuts. In one trial earti-
er this year the job was com-
pleted in 15 minutes. .

Friebele. who works with the
Alumni Activities Office. says
the cut lists are kept by that of.
fice as a part of each student's
permanent record. .

The present program is the
beginning of an over-all program
to use the computer in aiding
the entire campus administra-
tion.

Janitorial System

Still Being Evaluated

It is still too early to evaluate
the merits and shortcomings of
the new janitorial system in the
dormitories, said Mrs. Peter
Nicholls, supervisor of dormi-
tories.

Under the new system, the
janitors empty the waste bas-

hectic openings I can recall. It
is taking us so long to settle
down. A good many things have
contributed to this. The new
janitor service is one. There has
been a delay in obtaining the
cleaning equipment for each hall.

It is this last point that has
caused some complaint.

But there are more reasons
than the new janitorial system
for the hectic conditions preva-
lent in some of the dormitories.
