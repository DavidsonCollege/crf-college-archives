“All the world's a stage, andall the men and
women merely players.”

Shakespeare’s “As You Like It” cites the
interaction of life and theater. For Davidson,
students and faculty will get the opportunity to
once again host the Royal Shakespeare Com-
pany, starting in spring 2005.

RSC, which is based out of Stratford-upon-
Avon, first came to Davidson in February 2002.
Then, the company performed “The Merchant
of Venice” for the grand opening and dedica-
tion of Duke Family Performance Hall.

The new agreement brings the company to
Davidson for four years. During the first and
third years, the company will feature full pro-
ductions with master classes, much like their
previous visit. During the second and fourth
years, RSC educational personnel will work
with Davidson faculty to tie together themes
from Shakespearean plays to different classes
in various departments.

Michael Boyd, artistic director for the RSC,
wants to visit Davidson in December to work
out specific details of the contract and educa-

tional plans for the four years.

One of the many benefits of bringing the RSC
to campus includes the interaction with the
community. Current plans include an outreach
that would take actors and technicians of RSC
out into the surrounding schools, either doing
performances at some of the elementary
schools or becoming involved with some of

It was 5:25 a.m. when College Rela-
tions staff member David McClintock
received a call from alumnus Nelson
Tomlinson asking if West Residence
Hall was still “available.”

Startled and bleary-eyed, McClintock
confirmed that the hall was without a
namesake, and a few phone calls and en-
gravings later, Tomlinson became the
new name of Davidson’s westernmost
dormitory.

A native of Winston-Salem and re-
tired broker with Merrill Lynch,
Tomlinson graduated from Davidson in
1951.

He became interested in West, provi-
sionally named earlier for its location
on campus, after hearing a half-joking
proposal by President Bobby Vagt at a
fundraising campaign event. Vagt al-

Some students skeptical of
latest rankings’ legitimacy

The results are in, and Davidson is the sev-
enth best liberal arts school in the nation—ac-
cording to U.S. News and World Report, any-
way.

As the nation’s enthrallment with collegiate
rankings continues to escalate, and as institu-
tions continue to look toward media-deter-
mined status reports, ranking systems are be-
coming more and more prevalent. According
to a recent New York Times article, the “as-
sorted ranking systems have become
a highly lucrative and influential in-
dustry.”

Yet how legitimate are these re-
ports? According to College President
Bobby Vagt, the rankings “cover a
broad range” on the legitimacy scale.
“While we read them like everyone
else, and, while we would rather be
ranked No.7 than No. 17, we make no
decisions based upon trying to affect |
these surveys,” he said.

Nancy Cable, Vice President and
Dean of Admission and Financial Aid
at Davidson, agreed with President
