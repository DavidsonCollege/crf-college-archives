Trimesters Trap Students

Only a few people seem to care whether Davidson
operates on the term or semester system. The rest either
cannot make up their minds or just have not considered
the idea of changing to semesters.

But the question should be considered. Semesters are
better.

Semesters would allow students more room to decide
how to structure their education. The term system
prevents students from taking advantage of the many

semester-long programs other schools offer. Since the -

vast majority of schools in the United States operate on
the semester system, Davidson students wishing to
spend time abroad, at another college or university, or in
some other special program, have almost nowhere to
turn.

_ Winter term also presents a major problem under the
term system. The three weeks of classes before
Christmas just do not make a lasting impression on

students. Professors must resign themselves to teaching —

two separate courses winter term unless they wish to
spend the first week of classes after — reviewing the
earlier material.

Of course, proponents of the term evatenn argue that
retention is even more of a problem under semesters by
saying that students are bound to forget the material
learned at the beginning of a semester by the semester’s
end. Yet the student maintains contact with his subject
throughout the. semester while Christmas break
seems to be the perfect opportunity to forget under the
term system. ;

Critics of the semester system. also worry that
semesters might kill Davidson’s valuable Humanities
program and severely disrupt laboratory schedules. But a
credit-hour system could easily be instituted to allow
necessary extra time for Humanities and other special
courses. Besides, Humanities students complain even
now that the program 1s superficial simply because they
do not have time to keep up with Humanities’s heavy
reading load. Semesters could provide the time by

guess, and a bad one at that. Moving to semesters would
not change the number of students taking science
‘courses, nor would it increase the time:these students

‘would have to spend in the laboratory. Laboratory |
schedules might indeed have to be changed, but the ©

changes would probably be for the better since students
would have tanger blocks of tree time under sernesters
than with terms.

Even though it might be hard to tell by Davidson's

highly pressurized atmosphere, there is more to a college
education than book learning. Coliege.is atime to learn

about yourself as ‘well. Taking a long weekend or simply

looking inward is almost academic suicide under the term

system. The more spaced-out workload under a semester

system could allow students to lift their noses from the
grindstones and learn how to become people, not merely
doctors and lawyers. :

Above all, semesters would give students time to
think about their courses. Students are so immersed in

the day to day battie against papers and reviews under the |

term system that they cannot get any perspective on the
subject matter. Professors find themselves using class

time to drill in factual information instead of discussing

the meaning and theory of the facts learned. The purpose
of a good education is to teach the student how to
question, think, and understand, not merely. how. to

ingest. The slower pace of the semester system would —

allow peli techs st” eed spe :

Winter Is OK

To the Editor:

Sure, Winter Term at David
Son may be the pits as Features
Editor Aida Doss pointed out in
the January 18 issue of The
Davidsonian. But I believe that
certain opportunities for fun are
possible which can only be
taken advantage of during this
“so achingly and overwhelming

ly depressing” term. By Winter

Term you should be accustomed
to the work load. Reviews and
papers should be almost as
routine as wisdom teeth extrac-

- tions. (Perhaps, though, you

aren’t used to such strenuous
activities.) True the weather is

horrible, but look ‘at it as.

Mother Nature washing her
face.

Despite the weather and the
studies, Winter Term Blues can
be made less harsh if not
conquered altogether. Check
out some of the golden oppor-

tunities which only Winter

Term has to offer and take
advantage of them. Believe it or
not, Men’s Basketball is not the

Another unique aspect of this
award is its selection process in
which a committee composed
almost entirely of students
chooses the recipient from a
__.pool-of nominees submitted
solely by students. The selec-
tion committee consists of the
ten student. members of ODK,
two students recommended by
the SGA, two faculty members
and Dean Terry, the faculty
secretary of ODK.

Nominating a professor will
require a reasonable amount of
time and serious thought on the
part of the student. Nominating
forms will be available the
eighth week of winter term at
the Union desk and in the Dean
of Students Office. Any student
may submit a recommendation.
These forms must be completed
by the first. week of Spring
Term. All materials received
will be held in complete confi-
dence, used only for the pur-
poses of selecting this award,

_and destroyed when the recipi-
ent is determined. °

In addition to a description of
his academic and extracurri-
cular involvement with the
nominee, a student must in-

pare his degree of interest With
that of another. One cannot
effectively gauge interest with a
set of ‘‘guidelines.”’

For these reasons, PAX
House has voted neither to
accept nor comply with these
new “‘guidelines.’’ We encou.-
rage other houses and members
of the community to reexamine
this present policy. The ques.
tion is of sufficient import to
warrant consideration in ag
broader forum than a subcom.
mittee.

over 100,000 items checked out
last academic year, 217 were
reported lost.

Obviously no book losses are
desirable. Yet it is a source of |
real pride for us that the
number lost this year is 14%
lower than the previous year’s
number, less than half the
number the last year in the old
building, and the lowest num-
ber in the previous decade.

I doubt that any college
library anywhere can touch that
record (of course, they don’t
have the kind of students,
faculty, and staff her!).

Congratulations any
