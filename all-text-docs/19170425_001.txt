in Its History.

On last ‘Tuesday night, in the audi-
torium at Agnes Scott College, David-
son matched it’s argumentative skill and
logic for the third time against Emory
College and won the series. ‘The sub-
ject was: “Resolved, That the employ-
ers and employees of public service cor-
porations should be compelled to settle
their disputes by arbitration.”

FM. Gaines and H. 5. Garland, of
Emory, upheld the affirmative, while G.
C. Bellingrath and W. H. Neal upheld
the negative. ‘Vhe judges rendered a
decision four to one in favor of David-
son.

After the invocation by Dr. J. G.
Patton and two beautiful quartet num
bers by four young ladies of Agnes Scott,
the debate was opened by F. AL. Gaines,
of Emory. Fle showed the need of com
pulsory arbitration as a remedy tor pres
ent industrial conditions. He depicted
the herrors of a big railway strike and
what hardship it would) work on the
public. THe also emphasized the — fact
that the public is the third party in all
such disputes and should have a voice in
the -ettlement,

Gi. C. Bellingrath was the first speak-
er oon the negative for Davidson, and
began his speech by an able rebuttal of
Gaines’ speech, admitting the horrors of
strikes, but contending that the proposi-
tion the gentleman had advocated would
not do away with such industrial dis
putes. He further showed that compul-
sory arbitration is not the correct: solu
tion because it is unjust and wrong in
principle. It takes the right to strike
away. he contended, from the unions,
upon which their very organization is
built. He also contended that such an
arbitration court could not render decis
ions that would be free from prejudice
and bias, as they would be guided more
or Jess by what had been. decided upon
in the past.

H. S. Garland was the last: speaker
for Emory, and advocated the establish
ment of compulsory arhitrartion because
it would institute a just and fair means
for the settlement of all industrial dis
putes by a board of experts. He con-
tended that we have found our law
courts satisfactory in the settlement of
civil disputes and should substitute a
similar system for industry. He ex-
plained how the plan would work by
each party in the dispute naming. it's
representatives to serve on this board
and that the public would also have it’s
representatives, thereby insuring justice
to all concerned.

W. H. Neal, the last speaker for Dav-
idson, showed by quoting good authori-
ties that compulsory arbitration ha¢ ab-
solutely failed in all countries in which
it has been tried. In New Zealand.
where the industrial organizations are
not near so complex, the plan has proved
an absolute failure. He challenged the
gentlemen of the opposition to show a
single instance where the very plan that
thev were advocating had succeeded.
This statement and <ceveral others
brovght down the house in applause.

The entire debate was characterized

A. and E. Defeated
in Meet Saturday

Davidson Gets Eleven Firsts and
Wins 64 to 44.

In a tast and interesting meet, staged
on Sprunt Athletic Field, the Red and
Black sprinters won the event on last
Saturday over A. & E. by a margin of
20 points; the final score was 64 to 44.
Much interest was manifested by a large
number of spectators, many of whom
were out-of-town visitors.

The local sprinters outdid their up-
ponents in every event except one, which -
was due, no doubt, to the fact that A. &
E.'s best man, also captain of the team,
havirg been called out to the “Colors :”
but despite this disadvantage the visitors *
showed their ability on the cinder trail.

Homewood was the mainstay for the
visitors, winning third place in the high
jump, pole vault, and shot put, respect
ively, and first place inv the high hurdle
event,

Several local records were broken,
and some higher records disturbed. At
the crack of the gun, Mattison, for Dav-
idson, got off with a good jump. aad
finished the 100 yards in the close time
of g and 45 seconds, lowering Reid,
‘a7’s record by 1-5 of a secand, and com
ing, within 1-5 of a second of the world’,
record, held by Dan J. Kelly, at a 3-5
seconds. ‘Vhe other local records broken
were: Brand, in the mile run, finished
in 4 minutes 47% seconds, breaking his
own record of 4:48'4%; Grey broke both
of his own records in the shot-put. and
discus-throw respectively, his record for
the shot put being 35 feet 414 inches.
broken by his new throw of 38 feet: lis

fect it inches, broken with a throw of
