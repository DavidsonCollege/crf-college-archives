The ERA: Constitutional perversion, shocking effects, fearful homemakers

Charles Douglas

Discrimination on the basis of
race, religion, national origin,
and sex has been a major
problem in our society, and has
been the target of social re-
formers for years uncounted.
Although discrimination still
exists in some way against all
minorities, and women, most
are satisfied with the manner in
which solutions to their prob-

lems have been undertaken.

Women, however, still claim
that the level of discrimination
which exists against them is un-
acceptable. These women feel
that the Equal Rights Amend-
ment will solve their problems.

The most avid opponents of
the ERA agree that a problem
does exist, but question the
necessity and effectiveness of
this particular ammendment to
the constitution. There is defi-
nitely no lack of legislation
preventing discrimination on
the basis of sex. The most
prominent piece of legislation
which has been passed is the
Fourteenth Amendment. This
amendment contains the equal
protection clause which grants
women all the rights under the
law which men possess. There
are also scores of statutes
~ prohibiting classification by sex
as well as the Civil Rights Act
of the 1960’s, which prohibit
discrimination on the basis of
sex. These laws guarantee wo-
men equal rights, and if the
problem continues to exist it is
because of a lack of inforce-
ment, not a lack of legislation.

The ERA is not only unne-
cessary in the opinion of many
people, as can be seen is its
failure to be ratified in the seven
years alloted, but it was also
given a very questionable ex-
tension. Sam Ervin, a former
Democratic senator from North
Carolina, stated that the exten-

sion of the time limit was ‘‘a
perversion of the amendatory

process as established by the

Constitution.’’ The Constitu-
tion only allows for the sub-
mission of a constitutional pro-
posal to the states one time.
The Supreme Court of the

United States said in Dillon v._

Gloss (1921) that Congress has
no power to extend'the dead-
line of a constitutional amend-
ment. In this decision, the

Court also stated that a consti-

tutional amendment must be
ratified within a reasonable

-amount of time after its propos-

al. The seven year time limit

’ imposed on ratification of the

ERA, was decided to be a
reasonable amount of time. The
extension of this period is in
direct conflict with this Su-
preme Court decision. :

In defense of his arguments,
Sam Ervin points out that the
states which ratified ERA be-
fore its extension, ‘ratified an
amendment which was to be-
come effective within seven
years after its original ratifica-
tion; they didn’t ratify an
amendment which was to be-
come effective later than that.”
The states which ratified the
amendment before the original
deadline technically ratified a
different amendment than the
one which has been considered
in state legislative bodies since
that deadline. According to this
philosophy, the ERA as origi-
nally proposed has failed. If its
proponents wish to continue
their fight, they should be
forced to start all over.

Senator Ervin also said that
in his opinion ‘‘a state which
has ratified can rescind at any
time before an amendment is
adopted.’’ The Supreme Court,
in the ‘“‘Coleman Case,”’ recently
disagreed with the Senator. In
this case they ruled that rescis-
sion was up to Congress, not up
to the states. In doing this, the
Court ignored five or six pre-
vious decisions in which they
said rescission was a judiciary

question, not a political ques-
tion for congress. Senator Ervin
described this case as ‘‘the most
perfect example of judicial schi-
zophrenia in the history of the
Supreme Court.” It seams that

questionable decisions are all
that have kept the Equal Rights
Amendment alive. I the Equal
Rights Amendment important

‘enough to break the laws set

forth in the Constitution?

The Equal Rights Amend-
ment if passed will have effects
on our society which many do
not expect. Many opponents
like to point to the ideas of
unisex bathrooms and homo-
sexual marriages, but these are
very unlikely. The more obvious
and very possible changes are
almost as shocking though. One
of the most questionable is the
idea of women in combat. ‘‘You
presumably have women load-
ing 75-pound shells into artil-
lery guns,” says Professor Jules
Gerrard of Washington Univer-
sity. Proponents of the ERA
say that this idea is completely
unfounded, and that just as
women were exempted from the
registration for the draft, they
will be exempted from forced
military service. This exemp-
tion would be a blatent example
of classification by sex and
discrimination on the basis of
sex, and therefore should be
against the law as stated in the
Equal Rights Amendment.

Another area which would be
affected by the passage of the
ERA is our educational system.
All publicly funded single-sex
educational institutions will be-
come illegal. Many privately
funded institutions of this type
that receive any federal support
would be subject to a possible
cut-off of federal money. In
other words, passage of the
ERA would give the federal
government greater control of
our educational system and
more power over the private

sector than it already has.

Ratification will also raise
questions as to the legality of
such institutions as the Boy
Scouts and Girl Scouts, Private
men’s clubs such as the Rotary
Club and the Kiwanis Club,
Private lady’s clubs such as the
Junior League and the Daugh-
ters of the American Revolu-
tion,.and many other institu-
tions of this nature. It may mot
put an end to these organiza-
tions, but they are all, beyond a
shadow of a doubt, discrimina-
tory on the basis of sex.

Equal rights for women is a
relatively recent phenomenon in
the history of relations between
the sexes. Before these ideas
were introduced, women were
generally satisfied with staying
at home, taking care of the
house, and raising their chil-
dren. This is by no means the
demeaning job which many
now claim it to be; on the
contrary, it is one of the most

honorable endeavors which

could possibly be undertaken.
What would be more honorable
and more self-satisfying than
raising one’s children properly
and watching them grow up to
become good, moral, hard work-
ing individuals?

“‘Why would a lady want to
step off her pedestal and be-
come equal to, no longer super-
ior to, men?” This is a question
asked by one homemaker who is
a strong opponent of the Equal
Rights Amendment. She says a
lot about women in this ques-

- tion. Women are leaving a job

which no man can handle pro-
perly and going into fields in
which they are capable of
competing with men. Why
would they do this? I believe
that as we see more and more
children following paths which
lead to drugs, crime, and sloth,
women are becoming fearful of
failure in this difficult task. I
believe that it is this fear whicl.
has driven them out of the home
and into the role of the liberated
woman. And it is these women
that initiated and support the
Equal Rights Amendment.

In her editorial last week Elizabethi
Kiss remarked on the opportunity the
new Commons presented us to exercise
some creative potential and bemoaned
the apparent decision to simply move
ARA/Slater out of Richard and Bailey
and into the new building. This decision,
incidentally, is worth not only bemoan-
ing, but also regretting, mourning, and
rending one’s clothes, or even rending
Lisa Robinson’s clothes, however you
best express dismay. Not that Slater
doesn’t have some creative potential of
its,,.Qwn—anybody who can borrow
construction materials from next door
and pass them off as casserole has my
vote for Most Creative, not to mention
Most Disgusting. I remember the girl
‘working there last year, who, when
lumping the stuff on everyone’s plate
and handing it to them would look
reassuringly into each one’s eyes and
softly say, “I’m sorry. Really, it isn’t
my fault.”

Just how aware are students of the
food service plans being made for the
new Commons? To find out, I asked a
few campus notables.

Elaine R.Addabead:

“Well, I’ve never really been in favor
of the Commons. I mean, what are you

going to call those people anyway? |

Everybody knows that people at F&M
are ‘F&M’ers’, and that people at Phi
Delt are ‘Phi Delts’, but what about
people at the Commons — ‘commoners’?
It is kind of cute but, I mean, really, it’s
a big problem...”

Bo Heme:

_ ‘What Commons?”

Samuel Aragon Elitigation, III:

“Maybe if everybody’s Dad kicked in
enough money, we could have a Beach
Party there! If it’s nice enough, maybe
Annette Funicello would come! Maybe

‘we could give out little plastic seashells
and...” (At this point, Sam had to lean
over to tie his deck boots and lost his
train of thought.)

Our ignorance of plans for the Com-
mons could cause us to pass up
opportunities which will not present
themselves again. How many members
of the student body are aware that the
SGA passed a resolution, unanimously,
against establishing ARA/Slater in the
new Commons? Not many. In fact, the
case for a college-run food service has

not been put forth by anyone of whom
I’m aware.

In some ways, this is strange as it is a
very convincing case. Could we not
provide more work/study financial aid if
we controlled jobs related to the Com-
mons? Princeton University has relied
on such a system for years. Only cooks

‘are completely necessary —bussing, ser

ving, and cleaning up are jobs that could
benefit Davidson students who need
work/study but can’t get it.

A college-run food service would be
more responsive to the students. Slater
is here to make a profit. I have heard it
argued that Slater is necessary because
it can cut corners by means the college
can’t employ. If anyone wants to know
exactly where those corners are being
cut, all he has to do is remember the
Bulgarian Goulash of his freshman
year. Ever wonder where you'd seen
those chunks of beef before? That’s
right, they were in the chicken casser-
ole the night before. And where before
that? Yep, in the beef strangleoff the
night before that. Any institution that
has to water its days-old cake with a

plant mister to keep it moist, needs to

be cutting costs elsewhere. All the
College has to do is break even.

An administration official once re-
marked to me that the College wished
to avoid the cloud of comkplaints that
seems to, follow the freshman food
service, implying that Slater was the
preferred object of student revilement.
While such a posture will avoid a lot of
mud-slinging, it will get good food for
neither freshmen nor independents, a
group which is expected to increase in
number.

Meanwhile, Slater has offered a
scrumptuous new package deal to be
(gasp!) unlimited entrees. Great. It’s not
unlike having unlimited buffalo chips.
