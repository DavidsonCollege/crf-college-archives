Professors Anticipate

Dr. Louise Nelson, assistant

cautious in predicting swerp-
Ing economic change. Sle aug-
gested thal there would ve

Miss Nelaan emphuaized the
side effects that would result
from the plant, such as an in

mented.

Coliege Business Manner
Robert A. Currle was cautious
in evaluating the effects of the
new firm on the college. say-
ing only that ‘as long 93
wages and salaries continue to
go up, it will affect the cost
to the student.”

He explained that the college
tried to pay the competitive
rate in the area, and that Gen-
tral Time had probably set its
wage scales on the same basis.

It was the consensus of the
people interviewed that the
new plant would generally be
good for Davidson, *‘T cnn’l

on the college." Nelson said.

She suggested that the top
executive level who would
move to Davidson would offer
the college a now area of con-
tacts who would be interested
in the welfare af the school
and would help to spread the
“fame” of Davidsan.

He pointed out the increuse

Asked why General Time
had chosen to locate the new
plant in Davidson, a represent-
ative of the firm who bas had
to move to Huotersvitle theo
rized. “I belleve that they
must have closed their oyes
and pointed at a map.”

He was quick to point out
the proximity to Charlotte and
that the firm “Ilkes to locate

Nelson suggested that the at-

General Time to Davidson.
