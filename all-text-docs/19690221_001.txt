The only thing Davidson's
FM radio station still needs
to start broadcasting is its
‘construction permit from the
Federal Communications
Agency.

“‘Because we haven't re
Ceived the construction per-
Mit, we can't start taking
‘equipment from the radio
truck,”’ said Ed Dobbs, direc

to sell some equipment in
the truck for more money.
Until we can sell the equip

Mecessary he could ask the

Of Recent Amendment

At Odds, Courts Agree:

“We're going to do what
they'll let us do,"’ said Dick
Allison, acting chairman of

the SGA Court of Appeals
in a reference to Dr. R. D
Kaylor’s recent letter to THE
DAVIDSONIAN

Kaylor, associate proiessor
of religion, stated in his let
ter that a Court of Appeals
did not have ariy authority
over the Regulations Court,
since the SGA _ Constitution
has not been approved by
the faculty.

“A lot of this arises from
the way things are structur

places in the constitution that
don't say what we're really
doing. We've got to change
our ways or change the con

Kaylor said in nis letter
that one of the main objec

constitution was that it was
frequently vague or inconsis
tent. A constitutional conven
tion was called to rectify the
weaknesses in the document,
but a recent restraining or
der by the Court of Appeals
has halted the work of the
convention.

A Court of Constitutional
Review is under considera

place the Court of Appeals,
but the constitution cannot be
revised for that purpose un
til the restraining order is
rescinded.

Action

By JOE SMITH
Staff Writer

Phil Riner pre
cipitated a constitutional
crisis this week by bringing
into question the validity of
the most recent constitutional
amendment and the seating
of three new senaiors.

Riner has obtained, with
the signatures of four Court
of Appeals members, two re-
straining orders, which deal
with two separate constitu.
tional issues

Freshman

The first restraining order
prevents the Senate Execu
tive Committee from taking
further executive action,
claiming that the amend
ment which established the
committee was illegally
passed and is, therefore, in.
valid.

Sophomore Paul Rowland,
who will handle this issue
before the Court of Appeals,
said that his case is based
on the fact that proper elec.
tion procedure was not imple
mented in the passage of the
amendment by the student
body.

Among the objections Row
land said would be raised are
the facts that the Elections
Board was not in charge of
the voting process and that
no checklist of any kind was
used to prevent multiple

Fraternities Seek
Security Pledge

By CHARLIE KNIGHTON
Staff Writer

The question of going lo
cal continues to be a wide-
spread topic of discussion on
the fraternity court

Representatives of frater-
nities met at the Alpha Tau
Omega house last night
to discuss the prospects. This
was the second such meeting
initiated by the ATO's

According to senior ATO
member Greg Simmons “the
mood was conservative” at
the first meeting. However,
most representatives seem
ed to be interested in
strengthening the fraternities
for some sort of ‘‘unified
bargaining’’.

Senior Robbie Hooker, a
Sigma Phi Epsilon repre
sentative, said that a repre-
sentative is coming from the

nationa! ATO office at the
request of the ATO house in
order to discuss matters.

Simmons and a second sen.
ior ATO member Garee
Thomas met with President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr. Wed.
nesday morning to discuss
the school's role in a system
of local fraternities.

Simmons and Thomas
sought ‘‘written or oral as.
surance’’ that the college

would not use such financial
control to interfere in frat.
ernity affairs

Incorporation of the Inter-
Fraternity Council (IFC) so
that it would be able to make
loans to both local and na
tional houses on campus was
suggested and discussed .

ed by Garee Thomas work.
