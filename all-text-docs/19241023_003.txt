(Giton and Regen Speak
Before Volunteer Band

Gu:ton Urges Members to Associate
With and Aid Other Students

Last Sunday an interesting meeting was
held by the Volunteer Band. E. K. Regen
and T. A. Guiton addressed the assembly
and both delivered fine talks.

Tag Guiton spoke on the meaning of the
Volunteer Band to Davidson. He gave as
the purpose of the band: ‘To unite those

eign mission work.” He told a parable of
a student who was very religious, who at-
;tended church and chapel regularly, who
|never used profanity, who read his Bib.e
| prayerfully and in every way, tried to lead
,a religious life. But the other students
|seemed to regard him with suspicion.
| understanding this, he asked his room-mate

/uni
| what was the matter. His room-mate told
|him that he had ‘been leading the life of a
Pharisee. He began to mix with the other
students more, to be one of them and he
found that his room-mate was right. He
found that he had been doing as the. Phari-
feet had done, thanking God that he was not
as other men were when these men were in
| reality better men than he was.

In conclusion Guiten. said, “Men, don't |

E. K. Regen, in his talk gave several |
points on How To Secure Better Attend-|

points: First, get all members interested in|
a positive way. Second, formulate a defi-
nite plan for the year and strive to attain it.
