Students ‘Impressed’ ©

With New Chambers

Student reaction to the
renovation of Chambers
Building was widely varied,
but it reflected a general
satisfaction and pleasure with
the work done.

Senior Tom Peddicord re-
sponded quickly to the ques
tion. ‘I am very impressed,”
he stated. “I didn't believe
that they could possibly fin-
ish the work on time. I like
the lighting; the general ap-
pearance is pleasing; and I
am impressed with the crea-
tion of new space and use of
old space."’

Jim Lee, a sophomore, re-
flected the general concen
sus that the change was
“hard to get used to.’ He
added ‘'It is now modern and
functional. It is a very prac-
tical arrangement. It is. not
exactly a collegiate atmos
phere, but I like it.’

The fact that
was ‘‘a. definite
learning,’’ was noted by an
other senior, Joe. Friebele
Explaining his statement,
Friebele said, “The classes
will be cooler, the lighting is
better, and the soundproof
ing is a great idea.”

Unlike many Davidson
College structures which
have become outdated,

Chambers Building was not
torn down and rebuilt. There
was no need for such action,
for as one construction fore-
man put it, the 40-year-old
building was “built like a

concrete battleship.”

According to college Presi
dent D. Grier Martin, the de

cision to renovate — rather
than raze Chambers saved
the college several million
dollars. The actual cost of

the renovation will not be
known until all work is com
pleted, but a preliminary fig
ure of between 500 and 700

thousand dollars has been
given.
The renovation project

was financed by funds from
the Ford Foundation Chal-
lenge Drive, now within 400
thousand dollars of comple-
tion. In addition to Cham-
bers Building, the college
laundry and the Eumanean
and Philanthropic Halls
have also undergone major
changes and repairs.

Grover Meetze, director of
the college physical plant, co
ordinated the work of the
twenty sub-contractors who
worked on the project. To-
ward the end of the summer,
work. continued around the
clock.

The architects for the re-
novation were Lashmit,
Brown, and Pollock, from
Winston-Salem, and Barger
Construction Co. of Moores-
ville, served as general con
tractor of the project.

Anotner aspect of improve
ment was noted by senior Bill
Seigler. He noted that the
pleasant interior appearance
added to the stylish exterior
-would be a “helpful drawing
point’’ in attracting prospec
tive students. One of his
greatest satisfactions from

the renovation was ‘‘the re-
moval of the squeaking
floors."’

Sophomore Norris Freder-
ick said that he felt the re-
novation helped in that the
building ‘‘no longer looks
like a chamber.’ He added
that he is hopeful that ‘‘stu-
dents will take care of the
building so that the labor will
have not been wasted.”’

There was only one trend
of disappointment noticed.
This sentiment was express
ed by sophomore Tom Ber-
seuder, who said, ‘‘I like it,
and it is classy, but it seems
out of character. It doesn't
blend in with the rest of the
school."

No matter what the feeling,
however, on whether it fits
the rest of the school, almost
everyone agreed with sopho-
more Woody Gleason who
said, ‘It ic definitely’ much
more agreeable early in the
morning to walk into the new
Chambers.”'

Work on the building be-
gan in the spring of this year
ais workmen began to remove
the old wooden floors in
some areas. Before exams
began near the end of May,
students began to speculate
on the nature of the changes
to be made.

The decision to restore the
building forced several
changes in procedure — for
the summer. The college.
which normally requires that
all summer work be done on
campus, was forced to direct
students to take summer
courses at other approved
institutions.

During the summer, while
vorkmen were busy installing
2ew equipment, administra
tion offices were moved to
many different areas.

Workers will continue to
add to the changes over the
aext few months. The entire
building will eventually be
tir conditioned and con
tractors indicate this will be
tompleted within the next
nonth.

The modernized building is

Phi, Eu Halls Get
New First Floors

One phase of renovation on
campus is still incomplete.
Construction work continues
to progress on the first
floors of Eumanean and
Philanthropic Literary Halls.

The buildings, which each
have two seminar-type dis-
cussion classrooms, are be-
ing solidified and remodeled.
When completed, they will
house the Humanities discus-
sion groups and other sem-
inar classes.

Phi and Eu, as the student
body refers to the halls, are
two of the oldest buildings
on campus. For many years
they served as main class-
room buildings.

The two buildings serve to-
day as meeting place for the
Philanthropic and Eumanean

literary societies, as they
have for over 100 years.
During the past years many
noted authors and critics
have lectured in them.

The old and stylish upper
floors are not being altered
by the construction. Down-
Stairs, however, the floors
have been removed, the base-
ments have been filled with
stone to give a firmer foun-
dation, and new cement
floors have been laid.

The fireplaces will remain,
but the old heating system
will be replaced by a new
heating and cooling system.
A large seminar table will
be added to each discussion
room, and the seats will be
replaced by _ vinyl-covered
captain's chairs.

is in the psychology. depart
ment. All classrooms. and of-
fices in that section have
been moved to the newly-re
modeled north basement.

The area of the old psycho-
logy laboratory has been
completely redone to include
many new facilities.

When air conditioning is
completed in the basement,
students will be able to use
the two large classrooms in
the basement. Aside from
these rooms, many offices
and research rooms have
been built.

One innovation which will
enhance laboratory experi-
ments is the introduction of
two one-way-vision rooms.
The rooms, which are sep-
arated by one-way mirrors
will enable students to ob-
serve techniques in testing
and recreation in human be-
ings. Until the renovation,
there had been no such faci-
lities.

A new statistics lab has
been added. When all of the
calculating machinery has
been moved in, the room will
be used for computation of
experimental results and
other statistical work.

RENOVATION IN PROGRESS

Workmen Scramble to Complete Chambers Before Opening of School

New Psychology Labs, Amphitheater Rooms,

Five lab rooms have been
built to allow more stu-
dents and faculty experi.
mentation. There is one
general classroom lab,
which will be used by gen-
eral psychology classes and
four private research
rooms, which will be used
by advanced students and
faculty.

A more extensive shop has
been added to facilitate the
construction of — equipment
needed in the experiments. A
double room for keeping the
animals used in experiments
has also been built.

Psychology depart ment
chairman William G. Work
man said that he was “highly
pleased" with the entire reno
vation. He said that the new
arrangement of the psycholo
gy classrooms will enable the

_ department to. offer the stu

dents more in the way of in
dividual research.

There was only one con
struction mistake which may
cause a few problems once
experimentation begins. In
the room provided for the
animal colonies, the workmen
put tile flooring over the
necessary drainage system.

In addition to the usual
changes ,;which were made in
every classroom, there were
some very major changes in
a few. The principle exam-
ples are the economics class-
rooms.

In response to a request
from the economics depart-
ment, the classrooms for
that section were remodel-
ed into amphitheater style.
Seats are arranged in semi-
circular tiers.

The department requested
this type of classroom in or-
der to facilitate demonstra-

tions in the classes. Whereas
in the old classrooms students
had difficulty viewing the
demonstrations, in the new
arrangement every student
has clear visibility.

This visibility improvement
was. scorned by one student
who noticed, “The professor
can now see each student
clearly, definitely eliminat
ing any ideas of unattention.”’

Also undergoing a change
were several language class
rooms, which were trans-
formed into seminar rooms.

discussion.

Several departments have
been gathered in clusters
as a result of the construc-
tion. The psychology de-
partment will now hold
classes in the basement of
Chambers, in the redone
area of the old psychology
lab. The Bible department
has moved entirely to the
third floor, and the math
department has moved its
classrooms to Jackson
Court.

In all of the classrooms the
desks were removed, repair
ed, and refinished. This saved

the additional costs which

new desks would have forced.

The addition of air condi
tioning has also provided new
classrooms, which had_ pre
viously been used as storage
areas due to a lack of ven
tilation.

In one further change, the
old accounting room on the
third floor was moved to the
accounting laboratory, and
the old room was converted
into an audio-visual room. If
in the future, a new library
is built, the audio-visual facil-
ities will be moved into the
facility.

Switchboard Facilitates
Campus Communications

As part of the ‘‘new look”
in Chambers Building, a tele
phone switchboard connecting
faculty and administration of
fices has been installed.

The switchboard, which is
located in the alumni office
on the first floor, serves all
faculty, administration, and
student activity offices.

According to Robert Steph
enson, assistant business
manager of the college, the
new switchboard has enabled
all faculty offices to have a
phone installed at a cost less
than that of separate phone
lines.

Citing the modernity of the
switchboard system, Stephen
son added that the switch
board made it easier for out
side callers to contact facul
ty members and administra
tion officials.

The first phones were con
nected in early September,
as staff members began to
resume their work in Cham
bers. Phones were gradually
phased in in separate parts
of the building.

Stephenson pointed out that
Southern Bell Telephone Co.
installed the lines with only
minor problems. Adjustment
came smoothly and only mi-
nor mix-ups were reported.

The college has employed
Mrs. Harmon Gillespie to be
in charge of the switchboard.
Mrs. Gillespie was formerly

the assistant director of stu
dent housing.

The switchboard is in oper
ation on weekdays from 8
a.m. to 5 p.m., and on a half
day schedule on Saturday.
After the switchboard is clos
ed in the evening, calls are
routed to the Davidson Stu
dent Union,

Currie said that the new sys
tem does not eliminate the
possibility of a future system
which would include student
dormitory phones. He added,
however, that such an innova
tion would invelve quite an
elaborate system, and could
only be installed during a fu
ture dormitory renovation
project.
