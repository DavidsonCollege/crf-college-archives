return to the station, Wilson
said, “I’m not knocking those
who've decided not to go, back,
-. but my own personal opinion is
that if you back out you’re not

it, I want to be a part of it,” she
added. -

Wilson said that by going
back to work she hopes to gain
some sort of student foothold in
the new station; she said she
wants students to have ‘‘in-
put.”

’ She and junior Robert Payne,
. who ‘has been given the title
“Chief Announcer,”’ have eaten

radio candidates, according to.

Some of the senior managers
of the defunct WDAV student
staff have criticized Payne and
Wilson for going back to work
so soon after the October 16
trustee decision giving control

administration. —

explained, ‘There is an uneasi-
ness there with Rob and Fran-
ces, but it’s not an intended
bitterness or dislike.’’ Then,
after a long pause, he added, ‘‘I
commend her’ for it, I really.
. Asked why he himself would
not return to the station, Bes-
sellieu said, ‘Well I have to
confess to a certain amount of
pride and to a sense of betray-
al."

Auditions for students inte-
rested in working at the station
were held Wednesday afternoon
and only about 13 of WDAV's
former 60-member staff showed
up.

Roberts predicted that she
would hire some of those who
auditioned, although she could
not say how many. Wilson said
she thinks more students will
apply for jobs with the station
after Christmas and during the

_ Spring term as the initial hard

feelings about the trustees’
decision erode.

When one of the auditioners_

was asked why he was thinking

about working for the new

station, he said it is purely a
matter of needing experience
and wanting money, and added
he is still bitter about what the
trustees decided todo with
WDAV.. |

end of Christmas break:
» Applicants will be required: to
have completed at least two
years of college work and pos-
sess at least a 2.75 GPA.

Admissions will be competi-
tive, but Davidson and UNCC
students will be given first
preference; students in other
SASASAAS schools, second
preference; then students from
other institutions in the South-
east. will be considered.

On Tuesday, Kaylor said
“Cost to the Davidson student
will depend on the success of an
application now being made to
the U.S. Depatment of Educa-
tion for financial assistance for
the project, and a possible
application, if necessary, to the
Rockefeller Foundation. If
funds are granted, Davidson
participants would probably
have to pay only regular David-
son tuition, but if not, they
would likely have to pay an

additional sum in the area of

seven to eight hu:idred dollars.”

These fees will cover all
expenses except incidentals and
individual travel.

Staff members of the pro-
gram will largely consist of
Davidson and UNCC faculty,
particularly during the orienta-
tion period, but other SASA-
SAAS schools may also be
asked to fill some of the in-India
positions. One faculty coordin.-

students to program jazz and
contemporary music,’ she said.
But it all depends on student
interest, she added, because

As outlined in a rough draft
of the application to the U.S.
Department of Education for
financial assistance, the 1979
program will begin August 12
and end December 20, when
students return to the U.S.

A student admitted to the
program for 1979 would begin
assigned readings in the spring
of that year. He would be tested
on the readings upon arrival at
UNCC for orientation, and
would have to pass these tests
prior to departure for India.

In addition to the examina-
tions, the orientation at UNCC
will consist of study of Indian
thought, customs, and cultural
heritage and introduction to the
Tamil language (Tamil is the
vernacular of southern India,
although English is widely spo-
ken). Also, students would
present brief research papers
prepared prior to the orientation

‘period.

Upon arriving in India, stu-
dents will spend a brief orienta-
tion period in Delhi, then begin
ten weeks of study at Madras
University. Studies there will
include a lecture course cover-
ing Indian geography, history,
literature, political structure,
economic development, socio-
logy, anthropology, art, archi-
tecture, religion, and philoso-
phy. The course will be taught,
in English, by professors of
Madras University. The pro-
gram will consist of a Tamil
language course, a student re-

. Search project, and opportuni-

ties to explore various cultural
and political aspects of the
Madras area.

over the passage of the pro-

gram, and remarked, “A good
