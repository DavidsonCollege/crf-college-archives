MINISTERIAL AND
VOLUNTEER BANDS HEAR
SEMINARY DEPUTATION

Columbia Men Give Interesting Talke at
Joint Meeting of Volunteer and Min-
isterial Bands.

Last Sunday afternoon a most inter-
esting and helpful joint meeting of the
Ministerial and Volunteer Bands was
held, at-which four of the students from
Columbia Seminary spoke.

After having prayers and the Scripture
reading the quartette rendered a beau-
tiful selection, “In the Garden.”

The first speaker was Sam Hay, of
Davidson's class. of 1915. Choosing as
his text Matt. 9 :37-38, “The harvest truly
is plenteous, but the laborers are few:
Pray ye therefore the Lord of the har-
, vest, that he will send forth laborers in-
to his harvest.” He cited as two in-
stances of the ripe harvest the results
of two deputations sent out by Columbia
Seminary. The first was that of work
done at Camp Jackson, at which 18 out
of the 30 men present at one meeting
gave their hearts to Christ; the second
was the organizing of a Volunteer Band

of 40 girls at Chicora College, as a re-|

sult of the prayers and labors of Colum-

bia students. He also spoke of the 1,100

pastorless churches in the South. His
talk was closed with a strong appeal
to work and pray that the Lord might
send forth labors into His harvest.

The central theme of the talk of Mr.
Barber, one of P. C's former star
athletes, was our assurance of an eternal
heavenly home. We have the promise,
“Let not your hearts be troubled. In
my Father’s house are many mansions
. ” while those who are out of
Christ have no such promise. It be-
-hooves us therefore to seek to win them
to Christ.

Frank Yandle, a former Davidson stu-

dent ad graduate of the Moody Bible

Institute, using as his text 2 Tim. 2, gave
the following two rules which should
govern every Christian worker:
the right motive should govern every
service. Consider the widow’s mite.
Second, our services should be rendered
with clean hands. He concluded his
| talk by giving the famous poem,, “The
; house by the side of the road.”
| The last speaker, D. C. Stogner, ‘20,
gave a brief account of the religious
work that is being done by the Colum-
bia Seminary boys in cotton mills, jails,
hospitals, and similar places where help
is especially needed.

DOUG. FAIRBANKS IN
“DOWN TO EARTH”
FURNISHES THRILLS

“Down to Earth” featuring Doug Fair-
banks took Davidson by storm Satur-
day night. Doug takes charge of a
sanitorium and his fresh aid cure meets
with amazing results.

On the outbreak of a fake small-pox
scare, arranged by Doug, they slip on
board his private yacht and set: sail,
presumably for New York. All of the
invalids with their various ailments are
cast upon what they suppose is a desert
island but which in reality is one ‘sit-
uated very near a thriving town. Social-
ly speaking, Doug is estranged by the
cast-aways but with the shortage of
food they soon come around. Within a
month the secret is discovered but the
invalids, thanks to the outdoor life and
the exercise prescribed by Doug, have
regained their health.

A delightful love story is skillfully
woven into the plot which as usual ends
to the complete satisfaction of all par-
ties concerned.

During the intermission the quartette
from the Columbia Theological Sem-
inary sang several popular selections
which were enjoyed immensely by all.

COLUMBIA SEMINARY
DEPUTATION

for their help in the Bible classes, mis-
sion study classes, and for the splendid
music furnished by the quartet. All feel
that their visit has been a great blessing
to the campus, and that many life con-
secrations to Christian service will be
the result of their coming.

WITH THE OTHER COLLEGES.

Chapel Hill—The Spring German Wed-
nesday night concluded the dances for
Easter and the concensus of opinion is
universal that the dances were the best
ever experienced here and that the girls
j were one vast harmonious effect. The
; dances were given in Bynum Gymnasium
as usual and the Weidemeyer orchestra
of Huntington, W. Va., did the playing.

The Carolina Playmakers leave on a
State tour immediately after the pre-
sentation of the next series, to occur late
in April. “When Witches Ride” by Miss
Elizabeth Lay, “The Miser” by Paul
Greene and “In Dixon’s Kitchen” by
Wilbur Stout are to bé presented. The
budding actors will be absent from May
9 to 14, and in their tour Greensboro,
Winston, Durham, Raleigh and New
Bern will be visited and also probably
Goldsboro.

The portrait of James C. Dobbins,
Secretary of the Navy in Pierce's cab-
inet, which hangs in the Phi Assembly
Hall is one of the most valuable: paint-
ings in the state. The Navy department
made an.attempt to secure the picture
some years ago, in fact offered a large
sum for the picture but the authorities
tefused to sell. |

The Building Committee of the Board
of Trustees met recently and formulated
plans for the building program ‘to be-
gin in the early summer. The Stecle
dormitory and the new laundry will be
ready for use by the opening of the fall
term and the new structures -will he
well under way by that time.

bership in Golden Quill Order.

The Wearers of the Golden Quill have
recently requested the Davidsonian

honor comes to Roberts as a recognition
of the services he has rendered as
originator of the organization.

The Quill Wearers at their last mect-
ing appointed A. D. King to consider the
matter of a suitable emblem. At pres-
ent King has before him a number of
suggestions which have been offered.
