ELECTION---1966

GOP Victories Reflect Moderation

The results of last week's
Congressional and guberna-
torial elections demonstrate
several truisms about the
current American political
scene. The American peo-
ple’s preference for candi-
dates who project images of

pragmatic sincerity, their ;

unwillingness to deviate
from the narrow path of
moderation and the extent

to which the American poli- §

tical structure is screwed up
all become evident when
one takes a look at the elec-
tion outcome.

The Republican party appar-
ently learned well the lesson of
1964. For the most part. the win-
ners of 1966 rejected the Gold.
water ideology, turning instead
to images of moderation and
pragmatism. The names of
Romney, Rockefeller (both of
them). Percy. Brooke. Case.
Agnew. Bartlett and Baker can
be cited in support of this con-

put forth an apparently credible
image of increased moderation.
although he still must be con-
sidered conservative.

CALIFORNIA

Even so. California, as usual,
presents a special case of ec-
centricity. Pat ‘‘Jellyfish’’
Brown simply lacked the image
of dynamism which is a neces-
sity in the tinsel atmosphere of
West Coast politics. Despite his

A more typical race was in
New Mexico. There, the switch
from Democratic to Republican

VIET NAM

The role of the Viet Nam war
is evidence for all three of my
points. That the American pub-
lic is concerned about the war
is obvious: although it may take
the form of worry about infla-
tion or of personal hostility to
Lyndon Johnson, opposition to
the war as it is being presently
pursued is widespread. Yet, al-
though the Congressional Quar-
terly reports a loss of 33 non-
dissenters (as opposed to
“hawks” or “doves’) in the
House and two in the Senate.
the style of this opposition tend-
ed to emphasize only slight,

piecemeal quibbles rather than
the radical new approach to
forelgn policy so sorely needed.

This to me indicates the de-
sire of the American people for
a non-ideological, pragmatic
approach to the problem. This is
fine up. to a point, but such an
approach easily degenerates in-
to a shortsighted, error-ridden
policy that is especially disas-
trous in foreign affairs. Whether
the pragmatic approach has de-
generated to this point is of
course being debated, but un-
fortunately not by the politicians.

The only real “hawk"’ in the
campaign, retired General
Harry Thyng (yes, that’s right,
Virginia: it's pronounced “hairy
thing’) was soundly trounced by
incumbent Senator Thomas Mc-
Intyre of New Hampshire. On
the other end of the spectrum,
the only candidates to offer real
alternatives to present policy,
viz.. the ‘“peace’’ candidates,
tended to do poorly, although
here and there a strong race
was run.

Just how screwed up the
American politica] system is can
be shown from the fact that the

State YRC’s Demand

Victory In Viet Nam

By FRANKLIN ANDERSON
Staft Writer

Stiffer measures in the Viet

-|Nam war were advocated by the

Young Republican College Coun-
cil of North Carolina at-its fall
convention last weekend in Dur-
ham.

The convention specifically
advocated blockading Haiphong,
North Viet Nam’‘s chief port, a
bombing of war production
throughout the North and an end
of foreign trade with countries
which trade with North Viet
Nam.

The Davidson delegation.
which was composed of Dave
Jones, the chairman, Jim Mae-
Nair. Franklin Anderson, Roger
Duvall, Kent Antley and Joe
Beard, split on most issues ex-
cept this one.

The convention approved in
its platform ‘‘‘withdrawal from
that body (the United Nations)
until such time as it does guar-
antee ‘‘the freedom. of peoples
and the sovereignty of nations.”

An amendment calling for.
removal of the United Nations
from the U.S. if the U.S. with-
drew was approved 26-25. The
original motion passed 28-25.

In addition, the Young Repub-
licans called for giving the veto
to the North Carolina governor,
refused to approve a resolution

i

calling for damming the Per-
dinales River, rejected by ac:
clamation’a motion to advocate
repeal of all federal labor legis-
lation and demanded immediate
deployment of an effective anti-
missile missile.

Vespers Program
Features Students

Sunday Vespers will continue
to emphasize the student by al-
lowing students to take an active
part in roles as organist and
minister.

Scott Woodmansee, college
chaplain, states “I think the
church today is trying to. minis-
ter to the whole man.”

To emphasize this relationship
between everyday life and re-
ligion, each Vespers program
will have a different order of
presentation and quite often a
different kind of worship ser-
vice.

The experimental Vespers
service program will continue
on Sunday, night at 7 p.m. in
Lingle Chapel for two more
weeks, after which the David-
son College Religious Commit-
tee will examine the entire pro-
gram.

last two years.

The “Blue Sky Committee’
has not yet discussed this sub-
ject, according to Dean of Fac-
ulty Frontis Johnston. The Blue
Sky Committee is considering
changes in all areas of college
policy.

Some of the difficulties in such
a change would involve athletic
events in May or January, sum-
mer jobs and professors who
are teaching in summer schools
that do not end before Labor
Day.

According to H. Edmunds
White, admissions director,

there would be only a negligible
effect on the admissions opera-
tions or the number of applica-
tions if the college began about
the middle of August.

same time the Senate became|
more ‘‘doveish.’' Despite the
fact that Republican gains were
scored in both chambers, the in-
creased Republican strength in
the House is composed mainly
of men who hold more conserva-:
tive views than their predeces-
sors, while their counterparts,
in the Senate will generally up-
hold the liberal orientation of |
that august body.

All in all, though, the results|
of the election were no worse
than to be expected. We are }
hurting for a House of Repre-
sentatives, but the Senate will
not be too bad. And the intro-
duction of a few more clowns
like Maddox and Reagan into
American politics might help
us relieve a few of the tensions
of living in the nuclear age.

NO NEED EXISTS
Fletcher Hartsell Proposes Troop Withdrawal

Varsity Team Debates

Withdrawal Of Troops

The varsity debaters discussed
the consequences ‘of withdraw-
ing American troops from
Europe in chapel Tuesday.

Fletcher Hartsell and Jim
Cooley, both sophomores, de-
bated for the affirmative, and
junior Tom Rhodes and senior
Greg Haynes for the negative.

Hartsell opened with two main
points: no need for American
troops exists in Europe and
maintenance of these troops
harms the United States econo-
mically.

The harm, according to Hart-
sell, is primarily economic. The
balance of payments deficit is
aggravated by support of Euro-
pean troops, and America’s gold
supply is at its lowest level in a
quarter of a century.

Hartsell also pointed out that
the European troops could be
used in other American commit-
ments, especially in Viet Nam.

Speaking for the negative,
Rhodes stated that no balance
of payments problem exists, and
he maintained that the affirma-
tive had not demonstrated any
real harms.

He said that the American
troops themselves are not harm-
ful. “They aren't raping any
German women or spreading
any napalm,” he said facetious-
ly.

Cooley responded for the affir-
mative, outlining three types of
European commitments: econo-
mic, military and diplomatic.
He maintained that American

commitment is diplomatic rather
than military and that no treat.
ies need be broken.

The closing statement for the
negative was made by Haynes,
who cited State Department of-
ficials Dean Rusk, George Ball
and Dean Acheson as having op-
posed withdrawal from Europe
because of the potential Russian
threat.

“M” IS FOR THE MANY THINGS
YOU’LL TEACH HER

_ Nobody will dispute—surely not I-that raising children
is a task which requires full time and awesome skills.
Nonetheless, a recent nationwide survey has revealed a
startling fact: mothers who go back to work after their
children are’ safely through the early years are notably
happier, better adjusted, and more fulfilled than mothers
who simply remain housewives. Moreover—and mark this
well—the children of such working mothers are themselves
happier, better adjusted, and more fulfilled!

All very well, you say, but what’s it got to do with you?
Isn't it obvious? If you are underachieving at college, get
your mother a job.

What kind of job? Well sir, your mother is probably
between 35 and 50 years of age, so certain occupations
must immediately be ruled out. Logging, for example. Or
whaling. Or carhopping.

But don’t despair. There are other kinds of jobs—not
many, to be sure, but some. However, you must not stick
Mom in just any old job. You must remember that after
the excitement of raising you, she would be bored to tears
as a file clerk, for instance, or as a dolman. (A dolman, as
we all know, is someone who brings handfuls of water to
track layers. With the recent invention of the pail, dolmen
are gradually falling into technological unemployment.)

But I digress. I was saying, find Mom a job worthy of
her talents, something challenging that uses her vast wia-
dom and experience but, at the same time, is not too hard
on her obsolescing tissues. That’s what Walter Sigafoos
did, and the resulta were brilliantly successful.

Walter, a sophomore at the Upper Maryland College of
Wickerwork and Belles Lettres, majoring in raffia, a
proached the problem scientifically. Firat he asked himse
what his mother did best. Well sir, what she did best was
to keep hollering, “Dress warm, Walter!”

At first glance this seemed a skill not widely in demand,
but Walter was not discouraged. He sent out hundreds of
inquiries and today, I am pleased to report, his mother is
happily employed as wardrobe mistress for the Montreal
Canadiens.

Another fortunate venture was that of Frank C. Grans-
mire, a junior at the Oregon State Conservatory of Music
and Optometry, majoring in sties. Frank, like Walter, did
a survey in depth of his mother’s talents. Chief among
them, he found, was her ability to make a roast of beef
feed the whole family for three days. So, naturally, Frank
got her a job at the Museum of Natural History.

What has one to do with the other, you ask? Isn’t it
obvious? Anyone who can stretch ribs like that belongs in
paleontology.
