SAE Faces Allegations of Harassment, Violence

By Tom Koonce

A committee of six people --
two members of the administra-
tion, two faculty and two students
was formed to look into allega-
tions of impropriety and violations
of the Code of Responsibility on
Patterson Court. This committee
will begin with the allegations that

have been made against Sigma.

Alpha Epsilon.

These allegations were brought
to the attention of the administra-
tidn and the Board of Trustees in

several different instances this past
week. Such allegations came to
fore last Tuesday when the mem-
bers of Rusk House voted to not
co-sponsor parties with SAE for

the rest of the year. Two days later ,

a letter from visiting history pro-
fessor A.T. Miller was circulated
around campus. This letter cited
allegations of violence and harass-
ment committed by members of
the house and urged the Trustees
to take action to solve this prob-
lem. On Thursday a group of

Faculty Mandate Daily

Schedule, Extend Quiet

By David Smyth

The Educational Policy Com-
mittee, chaired by Vice-President
of Academic Affairs Robert Wil-
liams, sent a resolution for the fac-
ulty’s approval last week mandat-
ing a daily schedule that includes
an extension of “quiet” hours in
dormitories on campus.

Ina meeting of the full faculty
on Tuesday, the resolution was
adopted and was subsequently sent

to the Registrar’s office for. im- *

plementation.

The proposal outlines a sched-
ule wherein weekdays at Davidson
would be split into three large
blocks with quiet hours being ex-
tended from 12:00 a.m. to 7:30
a.m. Classes, also, would be cut
offat4:00on Tuesdays and Thurs-’

of the Philc
" newly elect

days and at 5:30 on Mondays,
Wednesdays, and Fridays. The
move apparently is in response to
complaints from faculty that their
students are unable to study or
sleep in their rooms.

These students have asked their
teachers for extensions on reviews
and papers because of hostile
studying environments, and their
pea pian sass John Heil

andone of the professors who have

expressed concem over this prob-
lem.

“We floated the idea of having
a noise cutoff at 11:00 or some-
thing, [don’t know what the status
of this is, This is just something:

‘we talked about,” Heil said. When

students organized a demonstra-
tion in front of the Commons to
show their frustrations about the
alleged harassment and violence to
Trustee members as they entered
for lunch. Miller gave his letter to
these students to hand to Trustees
as they walked into the Commons.

Rusk President Susan Wallace
said that her house’s action was
prompted by an anonymous letter
that she received from some
members of Rusk that cited con-
cern and fear over-various inci-

By Kevin Miller.

After several years of hard
work, enthusiasm and red tape,
Patterson Court is one step away
from expanding for the second time
this year. A group of 20-25 pro-
spective brothers, led by the ef-
forts of Al Gaines, 94, Lenny
McCallister, 93, and Assistant
Dean of Students John Eaves, are

' presently awaiting a letter of ac-
ceptance from the National Greek
Fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha.

The students, ranging from

freshmen to seniors, are looking
forward to bringing the oldest,
traditionally African-American,
national fraternity in America to

College Destined For New

Campus-Wide Alcohol Policy In April

By Tom Price
The trustees of the college
decided this past’ weekend to
empower the Dean of Students to
~ rewrite the school’s alcohol pol-
icy. Dean Terry said that within

- the next two weeks he will present _

specific objectives andrecommen-

dations to the Council for Campus
and Religious Life and to the Pat-
terson Court Council. After con-.
sulting with these two organiza-

tions, Terry will bring his final

proposal before the trustees dur-

ing their April meeting.

The new alcohol policy is sig-

nificant because it will be a com-
prehensive policy covering all
elements of the campus. Currently,

dents involving members of SAE.
The authors of the letter stated five,
incidents at SAE that were in con-
junction with Rusk or involved its
members that were examples of
why such an-attitude of fear had
developed.

The authors asked that Rusk

vote not to have parties with SAE
for the rest of the year. Wallace

stated that the authors realized that -

it was a harsh and drastic sugges-
tion, but lesser action had been
taken in the past and something

had to be done.
Wallace took the letter bo Dean

_Will Terry who advised her to

remove some parts of the letterthat
he felt were inaccurate. The letter
was then read at last week’s house
meeting and after lengthy discus-
sion the motion to stop co-spon-
soring parties with SAE was ap-
