Spring weather seems to be bringing a wave of enthusiasm for horse-shoe |
pitching as strong if not stronger than usual. A tournament for all the artists |
in this line should be arranged.

Along with the hot weather of summer and its flies and bugs, a set of screens |
for the windows of:the dormitories would certainly bring a comfort not known |
here usually in May, June, September and October.

With all the rain that we have had recently, there should be very little)
left for Speaking. All records should be broken by a long stretch of balmy |
spring weather to cap the climax of an enjoyable occasion.

Ten days ago, the Queens Choral Club gave us a fine musical operetta. |
With a program by this Dramatic Club about tc be put on, everyone will soon |
be anxious to pay them a return visit. |

JUNIOR SPEAKING |

The Juniors are certainly planning to put on a Speaking this year that}
their class and the whole school can well be proud of. |
The program at present looks more attractive than any of its kind in the|
past. Baseball and football games bring athletic entertainment; a cabaret af-|
fair at the Gym should cause a large amount of enjoyment,/and offer something |

novel also; and a Pink Tea for all men with girls will certainly be a pleasant| Too many customers and not enough pro-

innovation, |

All these things should make everyone of us want to be here Easter and |
have a girl up. Mofe pleasure can be had here than by going off, and the|
larger crowd that we have the more successfully will the Juniors be able to make |
their part, and the more enjoyable the occasion will be for all concerned. Let'’s|
all be on hand!

A LIFE WORK

When a man enters college, and especially when he reaches his Junior
year, it is almost essential to his future success that he have in view an’ end
toward which all his energies can be turned. For the greatest possible success
and happiness, it is necessary that the will of God shall lead him in making his
decision ; to choose that work for which he is best fitted, and for the accom-
plishment of which he has been created. With this fact in view, it is easy to
see that the life work conferences which are conducted at Davidson every year
by prominent and influential men of the Church hold a very high place among
the helpful and instructive things that this college has to offer its students.

Dr. Clark, of Columbia Seminary, has conducted such a conference for
us during the past week-end, that can hardly be rivalled in its interest through-
out and very beneficial, and, we hope, lasting in influences. The series of
talks that Dr. Clark made held the attention of every man present-and at the|
same time put clearly before him the issues he had to face in ‘choosing his |
life-work. The illustrations, both from the Bible and from life, which he used
so freely and effectively in all his talks, were told in such a dramatic and force-
ful manner that everyone saw lessons in them that even those among us who
were most familiar with Bible narrative had never before realized were there.

These stories brought home his truths with great emphasis; they served to
convince in a way that nothing else could have.

Now, when this series of services is just over, its effect upon us all is most

by, there is much chance that these good results may wear away; that our
bits will once more take possession of us. Let us all strive-to keep such

undesirable and hurful cikcunnigesle from coming to pass. Attendance at

THE MATTER WITH AMERICA ....
What’s the matter with America these
days?

‘Too many diamonds, not enough alarm
clocks.

Too many silk shirts, not enough blue
flannel ones,

Too many pointed-toed shoes and
enough square-toed ones.

Too many serge suits and not enough
overalls,

Too many decollete
prons.

Too many satin upholstered limousines
and not enough cows.

and not enough

a

ducers.

Too much oil stock and not enough sav-
i accounts,

Too much envy of the results of hard
work and too little desire to emulate.

Too many desiring short cuts to wealth
and too few willing to pay the price.

Too much of the spirit of “get while
the getting is good,” and not enough of the
old fashioned Christianity.

Too much discontent that vents itself in
mere complaining and too little real effort
to remedy conditions.

Too much class consciousness and too lit-
tle common democracy and love of human-
ity—Fargo, S. D. Forum.
