DWIGHT CHALM
GIVES PRACTICAL TALK

Our Relation to God Discussed by
Former “Y” President.

°

Dwight M. Chalmers, '20, of Charlotte
gave the student body an inspiring talk
on “Union with God” at the “Y" service
Sunday evening. In his talk he discuss-
ed the reason for the fact that we are
not nearer to our God than we are, and
how we may develop a close relation-
ship with Him.

In the first place we should seek this
close communion with God just as we
would seek intimate friendship with our

us, and should be scrupulously eliminat- '
ed

A second cause of failure is that some
do not want this friendship enough to
become thoroughly clean, to cut loose
from all evil and do His will entirely.
God is found only of them that seck
Him with the whole heart.

This state of close communion with
God once secured, though, is worth far
more to us in everyway than the tem-
poral worldly pleasures with which we
must part. The pride and joy that come,
from working with and for God is a
source of constant inspiration, and the
confidence that He, with all His power,
is backing one is a never-failing source
of strength. Since to know God is life -

fellow man. We should come into con-|cternal, it is our privilege and our reli-
tact with Him thru prayer often, and gious duty to put off the old habits, the

should do all that we can to please Him
and to carry out His wilt. God has
given us the Bible as our
guide, and allows us to talk with Him

by means of prayer, and we should take!
advantage of these great privileges to’

the fullest extent. We cannot expect
to enjoy this spirit of true fellowship
with God if we continually avoid Him

any more than we can expect to have Dr. Richards,

real friends among the men whose
company we shun.
Then he showed that one of the

many reasons why some of us fail to
attain to this relationship with God is
that we have failed to do His will. We
have wrong ideas of what we ought and
ought not to do.
tionable pictures on our walls, betting
on the various games, and similar cvils
all tend to destroy the highest ideals of

the Christian life that we have within;

DR. RICHARDS SPEAKS ON
“CHRIST, OUR CHAMPION”

“What the world needs today,” says
“igs a representative and
ho is courageous and
has both skill and power.” Such a one
is found only in Jesus Christ. His splen-
did courage and absolute fearlessness
appeals strongly to all who hear of Him.

The speaker chose his text from the
first verse of the third chapter of He-
brews. He pointed out that the main
requisite of our champions must be
courage. Christ, poor, despised, un-
known, went into the temple ahd drove
out the money changers, striking some
with whips. He went about preaching
publicly doctrines contrary to those of
the rulers of the people fearlessly, tell-
ing them of their sins. He died on the’
cross, giving Himself to redeem us from
the penalty of our sin. Wounded for
our transgressions, bruised for our in-
iquity, slain for our peace.

We look back through the Bible and
find men of towering spiritual statue—
Noah, Abraham, David—and after cen-
turics came Christ presenting Himself
as the champion of the human race
against Satan. Satan was never able to
score a single point against Him. His

champion, one w

absolute courage resulted in complete
victory.

Dr. Richards closed his sermon by say-
ing that Christ is our representative be-
He is God’s Son and
has power of intercession for us. If we
want to see the Father, Christ can take
us to Him. If anyone wishes to take
Christ.as his champion he should come
into the fellowship of those who have

already chosen Him as their represen- !

tative and champion.

‘INTERESTING RALLY DAY

HELD AT MILL CHAPEL

Other Sunday “Schools Show Good
Attendances.

The Rally Day exercises of the Mill
Chapel last Sunday evening held the at-
tention of more than 200 parents and,
children for over an hour. At 6:30 last !
Sunday night the annual Rally Day ex-
ercises began. Every class had part in
the program, each class having a pro-
gram of its own which was composed of
memory work, songs and short talks.

The most impressive part of the whole
program was not the faultless, memory
work of the older classes nor the beau-
tiful pictures, but little Katherine's part.

The little lady marched with the older

girls’ of Miss Simmons’ class to
the front of the chapel and as’
they turned to face those in the’

chapel she took her place in front of |

the class. As the music stopped those
who were there heard a faint baby lisp-
ing and then in a voice which could be
heard ‘in the farthest corner of the hall |
she said, “Jesus said, ‘Follow me.’”

After each class had rendered its part '

the lights were turned off and Mr. Jack-
son made an illustrated lecture on the
“Life of Christ.”

The chapel was attractively decorated
by Ed. Cunningham's class, and on the’
rear wall was a large sign welcoming
every one to the Rally Day exercises.
With few exceptions the largest crowd
that the chapel has ever held was out,
and everyone, both young and old, seem-
ed to have thoroughly enjoyed the pro-
gram.

The attendance of the other Sunday
Schools was as follows:

Shearer, 71 pupils, 7 teachers.

Oak Grove, 21 pupils, 8 teachers

Caldwell, 55 pupils, 7 teachers.

Brawley, no report.

Cornelius, no report.

‘COLLEGE MINSTREL SHOW

NOW SEEMS ASSURED |

Professor Erwin Consents to Act as
Director for Student Performance.

“Davidson is going to have a minstrel:

show this year,” Bobbie Long having an-

|nounced this in chapel last week. Now
i that

the annual occasion of Senior
Speaking has been done away with.
something had to take its place, for the
social side of that event cannot be abol-
ished. A minstrel show, to be given by
the Senior class, was finally decided up-

jon and it wilt “fit the occasion” much

better than the speaking, for even the
Seniors all agree on that point.

The details have not been fully com-
pleted yet. C. H. Long will be inter-
locuter, Houston White will have charge
of the music, A. L. Wilson and D. L. Ma-
hood will look after the sketch which
will probably come in the second act.
Professor Erwin will be director and
supervisor, as he has had experience in

‘}this kind of work. About 20 men will

take part in the show, with six end men.
The show will be held on Saturday,
November 27, at 7:30 p. m., so as to give

plenty of time for the fraternity recep- !

tion afterwards. A large crowd is ex-

pected and reserved seat tickets will be |

on sale in the near future.

There is plenty of talent here for a
good minstrel show, and with Professor ,
Erwin’s help and the backing of every |
student a good minstrel can be put on
which will be a credit to the college.

+

There is a great possibility of the
addition of an eleventh grade to the
High School as the State has made
an appropriation for it; the only dif-
ficulty is locating a teacher.

There are 220 students enrolled
in the Graded and High School, a
considerable increase over former

years.
