Theatre...
Random
Humor Makes
Workshop
Theatre a Hit

By Kevin O’Nell

Pot-smoking Indians, Bill
Clinton eating his morning
McDonald’s special, and an el-
ephant sentenced to death in court
all marked the Studio I production
by the Theatre 121 and 221 classes
Wednesday and Thursday.

The series of skits and songs
were both humorous and enjoy-
able as the players presented their
new understanding of the theatre
to a small audience in the Make-
shift Theatre Workshop.

So small was the set, in fact,
that several audience members ac-
cidentally sat in chairs placed on
the stage.

From the beaches of La Jolla
to the pubs of the British Isles and
from the art of fly-fishing to the
legend of “Merry Juana” (Kyle
Gamer), a jocular Native Ameri-
can, the actors took the audience
through five sets of selected and
original skits based on the theme
“Tales from the Land.”

Beginning with Miles Lowry’s
entrance as an elderly fly-fisher-

man, the groupings included “'Sto-. .

ries from the South,” “Our Cous-
ins in the British Isles,” “Native
American Myths,” “Tall Tales form
the Plains,” and “Contemporary
Lunacies” with the actors placed
in random groupings that allowed
them to play characters of varying
age, background, and interest.

Theskits chosen by the classes
appeared random but were enjoy-
able. A scene from a courtroom in
Tennessee portrayed the trial of
Dumbo the elephant, charged with
killing a small girl in a stampede,
and his eventual death sentence.
The seriousness of the jury in tears
as the lawyers made their appeals
quickly evaporated as the sentence
was carried out from a slide pro-
jector—Dumbo hanging from a
crane.

The nonsensecontinued in the
British section in which Whitney
Jewitt and Kakki McEntire por-
trayed poor women talking circles
around each other in a tea-house
followed by a companion piece
with Simon Priestley and Miles
Mowry complaining aboutwomen
and politics in a Scottish Pub. The
show ended with the “Contempo-
rary Lunacies” skits, written by the
actors. Familiar material was often
used in the skits: Whitney Jewitt
and Amanda Davis portrayed a
taxi-ride in New York.

The final “Contemporary Lu-
nacy” skit left the audience sing-
ing “When Big Mac Bill Comes
Joggin’ In,” a revised version of
“When the Saints Go Marchin’
In,” to the tune of Jeff Terrell’s sax
and the sound of the rain pounding
down on Cunningham’s roof. But
inside, it was all sunshine as the
randomness of material created a
refreshing performance from a

group of fine performers.

Daufuskie Island, S.C.: A Dying Way of Life

A Culture and a Language are Being Forced Out By Resort Developers

By Rachel Newcomb
“The islandis fringed with the
green, undulating marshes of the
southern coast; shrimp boats ply
the waters around her and fisher-
mencasttheir lines along her boun-
tiful shores. Deer cut through her

forests in small silent herds. The .

great southern oaks stand brood-
ingly on her banks. The island and
the waters around her team with
life. There is something eternal
and indestructible about the tide-
eroded shores and the dark, threat-
ening silences of the swamps in the

heart of the island. It is beautiful
because man has not yet had time
to destroy this beauty.” - Pat
Conroy, The Water Is Wide

The island is accessible only
by boat. One of a chain of tiny sea
islands off the coast of South Caro-
lina, it is the only island that hasn’t
been connected to the mainland
and turned into a resort commu-
nity. It is also the only island
which still harbors a vanishing way
of life.. Many residents still live the
way they have for generations, fish-
ing or weaving baskets from marsh

grass for their livelihood and re-
siding in small shanties off dirt
roads. A fertile land of marshes
and oyster-rich coastal creeks,
Daufuskie island is still fairly un-
tainted by progress and develop-
ment. But this may change. Al-
ready two resorts take up half the
island. If the pattern on other sea
islands is any indication, Daufuskie
residents may be driven away by
obscenely high property taxes to
make room for vacationers.

For over a handred years, this
unique sea island community has

Residew Jams on Patterson Court
Band Entertains Hundreds for Lazy Saturday Afternoon

By Chris Frampton

The sun finally shown on Sat-
urday, and Davidson was ecstatic.
About four hundred people filled
the Court, eating free pizza and
drinking free lemonade. In KA,
PiKA,and Kappa Sig, people drank
something else.as alumni and cur-
rentstudentsrelivedoldtimes. And
among all of that, the Residew kept
the air filled with their familiar
mix of classic rock and originals.

“It’s cool.”

That’s was what Chip Petree,
the band’s bass player, said during
their break about half way through
the show. Although the crowd
wasn’t exactly perfect, everyone
was a little bit more interested in
the sun than the band, but the Dew
kept at it.

And it paid off.

Throughout the afternoon, stu-
dents could be seen bouncing their
heads, playing drums on their legs,
or playing air guitar. The space in
front of the band was always filled
by someone dancing and laughing
to the music.

The Residew’s original song,

“Schmo” brought the smiles out.

Everyone seemed to know the
words and about half the audience
knew the guitar part. On the corner
of the patio behind the commons,
someone ran at the gigantic, inflat-
able ball and dove on it, screaming

_ “Schmo.” Perhaps they had spent

too much time in one of the houses.

In two of those houses, KA
and PiKA, brothers and their dates
were eating roasted pig, playing
cards, and just sitting around. At
Kappa Sig, a gigantic water slide
was set up and people from all over
the court were lining up to take
their turn. On the porch of Rusk,
three friends were laying back in
their chairs, Solo cups resting on
the tables, sleeves rolled up to their
shoulders, their faces looking up to
the sun.

On the grass around the patio,
blankets kept people offthe ground
as they tried to get some of the sun
they hadn’t seen in weeks. These
were the people that most pleased
the Dew.

As Chip put it “It’s great to
see everyone just sort of lying
around and listening to us. It's
cool. In a way it’s kind of like
we’re aradio. Normally, that type
of thing makes me mad, but today
I wish I was in the audience. We’re
glad we were able to be part of this
day.”

And they were.

Sitting on a bench near the
pizza, Matt Spear said he loved
listening to Residew. As he put it,

“They are just sort of a great band —

to listen to. I have one of their
tapes and I love to use it to study to.

[They have] a good beat and a
good sense of where to go while
they are playing.”

Yvette Pita agreed. “The gui-
tar is great. Julian [Cochran] and
Fud [McKinney] play great on the
guitar and Chip’s base is hot. It's
perfect for a day like today.”

After saying that Y vette turned
around and started dancing with
Phelps Sprinkle. The two of them
danced the way that almost every-
one dances to this band. It is kind
of bouncing sort of sway that al-
lows for individual variations.
Basically, it fits right with the
band's style of music.

existed off the coast of South Caro-
lina in relative isolation. On
Daufuskie island, next to Hilton
Head, a culture known as Gullah
has developed that is unlike any
other. Originally settled by Indi-
ans, Daufuskie became profitable
to Europeans, as it was suitable for
cropssuchasriceand indigo. With
the Europeans came slaves, who,
unlike mainland slaves who picked
up standard English, developed
theirown language. Called Gullah,
this tongue was a mixture of En-
glish and West African dialects
and washanded down through gen-.
erations. In 1979, reports found
100,000 South Carolinians who
spoke Gullah. In the 1990 census,
180 spoke the language.

After the Civil War, the whites
leftthe island. Forahundred years,
Daufuskie was like many of the
other sea islands surrounding it.
Blacks lived unobtrusively off the
earth, having little communication
with the outside world. But gradu-
ally, each of the islands began to
see development. Islanders were
either lured away by real estate
offers or forced to leave because
they could no longer afford the
heavy property taxes. Daufuskie
is the only one which still main-
tains some vestiges of the past.

Over the years, the Gullah
developed many unique customs.
Windows and rooms were painted
blue, to scare off spirits. Intricate
Gullah baskets resemble West Af-
rican designs, and herbal medicine
remedies have been traced to Afri-
can potions. Gullah burial cus-
toms dictated that the afterlife be
filled with necessities; graves were
elaborately decorated, then kept
sacred and undisturbed.

The two resorts divide the is-
land and admission is restricted.
According to some of the black
residents, one of the resorts is built
upon a Gullah graveyard. The
resort denies this and states that its
presence has actually helped the
Daufuskie natives by creating jobs.
It is likely that more construction
will come, and more islanders will
move away. By the year 2000, itis
predicted that 10,600 people will
live on Daufuskie. Many of the
native blacks will be forced to move
away.

Things have definitely
changed. Pollution from the Sa-
