WILL DRINKING RULE. CHANGE?

NUMBER TWENTY-THREE

Davidson Campus Is Dry, With A Large Damp Spot

‘Firat in A Serles
By BOB REIO
Assoclatg Editor

Davidson students drink.

Byery day.

And ji's nol ‘Susi up the road," More
likely, it's on campus. 11 rooms. in fra-
ternity houses. In the Union.

In contrast, the Faculty Code of Stu:
dent Conduct atrictly forbids dvinking
on wamnpus and in the town of Davidson.

lt also provides strict penalties for its.

ytolation.

“Davidson College is opposed to the
use of alcaholic beverages by students,”
according to Section Five of the gentle-

manly conduct clanse. “A student will
ordinarily be suspended if he is found
guilty of violating ithis regulation).

Since the student Honor Code prohi-
bition against drinking was voted aul by
the student body in 1966, the faculty
ritle has not been enforeed wilh diligence
or uniformity.

Soon after the student rule was
aholished, several students, including the
son of an influential trustee, were:
charged with violating the faculty rule
by campus security guards, The students
were campused, a intld sentence com

pared to tive earlier policy of suspension,

Since then several students have been

canipured for violating the rule. But in
most cases the security officers, wha en
force the facully rules, apparently do
not view enforcement of the rile as ane
of their prinyary duties.

Most students foe] that dt is a good
thing they don’l in ihe words of one,
“they'dl have to kick out three-fourths of
the school if the drinking rule ‘ure
enforcod *

Although few students pitch wild
@ronks in the dorms, muny do thiTnk,

‘either fn their rooms or fh fraternity

houses. Many wonder why the college
authorities do not accept this fact and
abolish the facully rule. too.

“Kverybody knows we drink.” sald one
siuden! as he sat in a room decoraled
with empty liquor bottles. “The faculty
is being foolish I they believe there will
Be ao razh of wid. on-campus drinking if
their yule is abolished.”

“People that want to drink do it now
anyways. [ don't think many more people
would start drigking on campus if the
rule were gone”

Sludent opinion sven to favor modi-
fication of the campus rule, considering
dhal a number of candidates in the recent
student body election included sich a
plank th thelr platforms. Suggestions
range from a completely wet campus to

allowing restricted drinking on dance
weekends..

For weeks now, the student body has
een waiting for the Committee on Rules
and Punishments, which has been re-
viewing campus regulation3, to make
public-its suggestions. Most assume that
CRAP will present a plan for modifying
the faculty rule.

Tn the meanthne, drinking continues.
“Ehe dvinking rule is probably en its
fast legs.” observed one student. “Walh
30 inuch else happening in the world, J
ean'L iniagine a school like this ane wor
rving 60 much over thal silly rule.”

Workman Challenges
Students On Tokenism

By FRANKLIN ANDERSON
Monoging Editor

Psychology professor W. G, Work- ~

man has offered to match $2400 raised
by students with $100 for a scholar-
ship for a Negro student if the stu-
dents will raise the money.

He also said that he felt “confident
that 10-or 12 others (faculty mem-
bers) would be willing to do the same
thing.”

Reacling to an editorial in the
March 21 issue of THE DAVIDSON-
JAN, he challenged students to prove
the seriousness of their criticisms by
supplying the money.

The editorial accused the college of
“evading the responsibility it has to
the nation and to the South 10 educate
and develop responsible Negro lead-
ership.”

Boyte Says Davidsonian
Failed To Communicate

By 808 TRAVERS
Associate Edlior

“Lousy” was Sam Boyte’s description
of the year he spent as editor-in-chief of
THE DAVIDSONIAN.

“Because of the competence of the
Staff, the paper was basically sound, but
it didn't communicate with the students,”
he said. “It wasn't an important influence
on the campus.”

He termed the campus newspaper tech-
nically “altractive’' and called St “a very
necessary thing,” but, he said, a paper
should “report the news and raise a
litde bell—especially in a place which
is as cloistered as Davidson. There hus
to be something or someone around to
stir the place up.”

Although disappointed with the paper
during his tenure as editor, Boyte said
he didn't think it was entirely the news-
paper's fault.

“One of the most useful things we
could have done would have been to be
the organ for students’ demands to be
made public,” he explained. >

“Students should be aware that a
railing wall’ exists in THE DAVIDSON-

AN.

Boyte said he has been espectally dis-
appointed that students will complain in
private about college policies, but they
won't go out on a limb to change things.
_ “One thing anyone who gets involved
in pnything ere learns to develop fs a
Teal attitude of impatience with these
Kdnd of people," he said.

“It can make you awfully hitler about
this place.”

“T think what this campus needs is a
lunatic, activist element," Boyte con-
tinued.

He said he thinks one thing necessary
to correct the situation is for the college
to get a more diversified student body.

A random sarnpling of tac.

Dr. J. O. Embry, professor

doubt about the method the
