LIBERTY LOAN SUBSCRIBED

In the Third Liberty Loan the Da-
vidson people are again gallantly de-
fending democracy with their dollars,
$7,350 worth of bonds of the assigned
$9,100 having been subscribed up to 12
o'clock Saturday; the 27th. In one day
recently $2,200 worth were sold.

There is one week left to reach and
surpass the appointed goal. In the last
loan $16,550 were subscribed, which
was about 20 per cent above the David-
son allotment. With a strong rally in
these last days left to this loan another
over-subscription ought to be made.

quantities. Some $6,500 worth of them
have been sold by the local postoffice.

NEW REFERENCE WORK IN
THE CARNEGIE LIBRARY

The second edition of the “New In-
ternational Encyclopedia” containing 24
voliimes has recently been added to the
number of books in the library. “The
first edition was published in 1902-4.
World progress and the many changes
in the last ten years have made it neces-
sary for the entire text to be rewritten.
Some of the new features are the use of
the single alphahet, the arrangement of
subjects under titles to which the reader
would naturally turn, an inclusive title
list, and a full and practicable biblio-
graphy for all importante subjects. “This
encyclopedia is a splendid addition to the
reference works of the library,
