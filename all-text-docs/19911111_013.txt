Volleyball Finishes Second In Big South,
Mimi Plauche Named Player of the Year

By Bruce Balestier

Perhaps overwhelmed by an
emotional pre-game ceremony that
honored seniors Holt Hathaway,
Mimi Plauche and Christy Knight,
the Davidson volleyball team
turned in a somewhat disappoint-
ing performance Tuesday in a 15-
5, 15-12, 15-10 loss to UNC-
Greensboro.

The ‘Cats started slowly
against UNC-G that was at the top
of its game from the opening serve.
Several Wildcat errors figured ina
9-0 Spartan run that began, and
effectively ended, the first game.
Davidson strung together a few
points late in the game, but fell 15-

5S.

‘ The second game was a much
more competitive affair. Kather-
ine Anderson’s decisive kill of a
short set by Hathaway gave the
Wildcats a commanding 8-2 lead,
and Davidson seemed ready toeven
the match at one game apiece. But
the walls fell down in a hurry, as
UNC-G scored 8 straight points to

take a 10-8 lead. The Spartans
pushed their cushion to 13-9, but

After the game, coach Rebecca
Hawkins lamented her team’s ina-
bility \to cap-
ture the mo-

back. The serving
of Jennie Wagner
brought the ‘Cats
within 13-12, but
they couldcomeno
closer. UNC-G
took the game 15-
12.

In the final
game, Anderson’s
hitting and block-
ing spurred the
‘Cats to a 4-4 tie
before UNC-G put
the match away. A

mentum of the
match. Hawk-
ins cited ques-
tionable calls
and missed
serves. among
the reasons her
team “just
never got any-
thing going.”

Mens Soccer Ends Season
With Disappointing Loss to UNC- A

By Tom Price

The men’s soccer team lost to
the University of North Carolina at
Asheville -1-0 on Tuesday in the
firstround of the Big South tourna-
ment. The loss ended the season
and made the Wildcats’ Gnal rec-
‘ord 8-10-2.

The loss was especially tough
for the ‘Cats because they con-
trolled- much of the action and
clearly outshot the opposition.
Defender Craig Omli said, “It’s
frustrating for us because we
-worked so hard this year and we
hate to endthe season with a loss to
a team we should beat.”.

The game remained scoreless

With what Coach Caroline
Brown-Price called the “bragging
rights for Mecklenburg County”
on the line, Davidson used strong
doubles: play to break open a tight
match, and coasted to an 8-4 win
over UNCC last Saturday.

- After forging a 4-4 tie with the
49ersin singles play, each Wildcat
doubles team won decisively to
propel the ‘Cats to the victory.

_ Number one tandem Cyndi Hess
- and Kimberley Nance tuned in a
4 6-1, 60 win, while #2 team Bar-

until UNC-A scored midway
through the second half. The. ball
was crossed to the middle of the
field from the rightside. The UNC-
A player who scored was on the
ground, but managed to get his
foot on the ball. Goalkeeper Doug
Long was moving to his right and
couldn’t change direction in time
to stop the shot.

The Davidson players didn’t
hang their heads after falling be-
hind and seemed to believe that
they could come back. During the
game’s last ten minutes, the ‘Cats
had several excellent opportuni-
ties to even the contest. Defenders
Matt Spear and Craig Omlimoved

only slightly more trouble in a6-0,
6-3 win. The # 3 team of Jennifer
Beahmand Nicole Wilcoxclinched
the win with a 6-1, 6-3 triumph.
With the outcome decided, # 4
team Karen Kingsley and Rebecca
Billingsley played just an 8-game
pro set with their UNCC oppo-
nents, winning 8-3.

Hess, Wilcox, Billingsley and
Mary Faith Mount contributed
singles victories for Davidson.
Mount’s match at # 7 was the final

~ singles match to finish, and her

up the field in an attempt to in-
crease the offensive pressure.

The best chance came with only
1:12 lefton the clock whena UNC-
A player was called fora hand-ball
foul within the goalkeeper box.
Senior co-captain Lance Long was
picked to take the penalty kick.
Coach Slagle hoped that Long
could repeat his performance
against Wake Forest this past
Sunday, where Long’s penalty kick
off-another hand-ball foul was the
winning goal.

Long’s shot, however, was
stopped by the diving UNC-A
goalkeeper. Against Wake Long
chose the left corner, but against

gutty, 7-6,4-6, 7-5 win deadlocked
the score entering the doubles.

The UNCC match capped a
string of fall matches that Price
called “the strongest fall season
that we’ve ever had.” The level of
competition and sheer number of
matches in the fall slate has, ac-
cording to Price, sparked extraor-
dinary improvement in the team.
In the spring, Davidson will seek
their second straight Big South
Tournament Title.

The last individual competi-
tion of the fall occurred this week-

Tournament. The Wildcats drew
last-place Campbell in the first
round, and came out ready to play,
advancing to the semifinals with
an easy, 15-5, 15-4, 15-11 win. In
Saturday morning’s semifinal, the
‘Cats downed Liberty, 15-2, 15-7,
8-15, 15-1.

Predictably, Saturday after-
noon’s final was a matchup be-
tween the top two teams in the
league during the regular-season,
Davidsonand UNC-Asheville. The
Bulldogs gained revenge for a
regular-season loss to the ‘Cats
with a 17-15, 12-15, 15-8, 15-9
win, but the Wildcats were ham-
pered when Plauche was lost to a
sprained ankle.

In Friday night’s conference
banquet, Plauche was named Big
South player of the year, and was
joined on the All-Big South team
by Hathaway. Jennie Wagner and
Amy Howard were named co-
MVPs of the tournament. Plauche
was also selected to the all-tourna-
ment team.

UNC-A he decided to go right.
Unfortunately for Davidson, the
Builldog goalkeeper chose ‘the same
direction.

This game ended a frustra*ing
season for the Wildcats. Expecta-
tions were high at the beginning of
the season, largely because of the
team’s success last year. In the
second game of the year, however,
the team lost their leader, All-
America Rob Ukrop. Ukrop was
responsible for 22 goals and 12°
assists during the 1990 season and
his offensive production proved to
be irreplaceable.
