Deep Thoughts eis

It Could Be Very
Helpful If We All Ate Together

«Let’s consider, for a moment,
the arenas in which men and
women interact with one another
most often on this campus. First of
all, there is the classroom, where
the majority of the time is spent in
obedient silence to our more
learned elders.

Then there is the hallway,
where the generic salutation is ex-
changed multiple times in a given
morning. Of course, there are par-
ties— settings in which overly loud
music or overly consumed alcohol
usually reduce interaction to some-
thing less than meaningful.

Freshmen and independents,
however, have the Commons,
which provides them with an at-
mosphere most conducive to con-
versation and mutual understand-
ing. _

Itisamazing how much of life
revolves around the partaking of
food. Everything from business
transactions to treaty negotiations
is often conducted over a meal.
The reason behind this tendency
is, I believe, because meals are
relaxing times for us.

In eating we are refueling our
bodies and replenishing the nutri-
ents that keep us healthy. Often we
are settling our minds as well, for
no matter how harried we might
be, we must take time out to eat.
Meals, then, should be some of ne

best times for us to get to know one
another better— our guard isdown,
we are relaxed, we have lettuce in
our teeth. No pretensions allowed.

So why is it that after fresh-
man year, when we all seem to
learn so much about one another,

that we tend to sequester ourselves
into single-sex eating establish-
ments that, for many men, at least,
are too homogenous? My point in
posing this question to the com-
munity is not to attack the structure
of fraternities and all-female orga-
nizations in place now.

Indeed I am a staunch propo-

nent of the kinds of groups we |

And Now You Want
to Be Called African-Americans

By Marilyn Ambroise

History reveals that African-
Americans were robbed of their
pride and dignity.

History-A chronological
record of events, as of the life or
developmentofa people or institu-
tion; the branch of knowledge that
records and analyzes past events.

Pride-A sense of one’s own
proper dignity or value. To in-
dulge in self-esteem.

Dignity-The quality of con-
dition or condition of being es-
teemed or honored.

Kidnapped from their home-
land, African-Americans became
victims.

Victim-Someone who is
harmed or killed by another. One
who is harmed: by or made to
suffer from an act, circumstance,
agency or condition. A person
who is tricked, swindled, or taken
advantage of.

' Andasmostvictims, they suf-
fered of shame.

Shame-A painful emotion
caused by a strong sense of embar-
rassment, unworthiness or dis-
grace.

Albeit, later freed, the labels
and stigmas associated with Afri-
can-Americans followed.

Label-Something functioning
as a means of identification.

Stigma-A mark burned into
the skin of a criminal or slave. A
mark or token of infamy, disgrace,
orreproach. A mark of vindictive
of a history of a disease or abnor-

mality.

Forawhile, the load felt lighter
onthe shoulders of African-Ameri-
cans.. For a second, there was
hope. But as the lines of distinc-
tion between black and white got
bolder—hope began to fade.

Black-Soiled from soot; dirty.
Evil; wicked. Cheerless and de-
pressing; gloomy. Marked by an-
ger or sullenness. Attended with
disaster. Deserving of, indicating,

presently have, but I am just won-
dering if perhaps eating together
should be one of the activities en-
gaged in by these groups.

I think we are all aware that
the experience of being a man or a
woman in the modern world has
aspects which are peculiar to that
particular sex. Men and women
see the world from different per-
spectives, they go about trying to
solve its problems different ways,
and they react differently to their
success or failure.

Consequently, it is only natu-
ral for men and women to have an
outlet in which their masculinity
or femininity is affirmed rather
than threatened. This outlet does
not necessarily have to involve
eating on aregular basis, however.
In fact, eating regularly together
might even be detrimental to the
good that single-sex institutions
do; one might grow accustomed to
an atmosphere that is found very
seldom in later life.

In arriving at this idea that
single-sex eating may not be
Davidson’s greatest strength, I
compare my experience here to
my sister’s at Sewanee, where ev-
eryone eats together for their en-
tire college career. 1 know how

mate remedy for a 200 plus years-
old disease. The level of self-
esteem in the African-American
community was immeasurably
low. African-Americans began to
search within themselves for the
answer to the question, “What can
we do about it?” For, it became
evident that low self-esteem was
related to low success.

Psychologists will admit that
verbal and mental abuse is more

detrimental and less helpful to
the recipient of the abuse than the
abuser thinks. For instance, if
you repeatedly say to a child,
“you will never amount to any-
thing”, the chances of failure in-
crease. Here, what you have done
is conditioned the child for fail-
ure.

African-Americans face a
similar problem. If one consid-
ered the connotative and denota-
tive meaningsof the word “black,”

it is very difficult for a sensible
individual to not arrive at the con-
clusion that labeling anyone
“black” can have a disturbing im-
pactonone’s self-esteem and, more
generally, on one’s life.

Thus, inconclusion, when you
hear someone complain about Af-
rican-American’s desire to be
called African-Americans and not
“blacks,” perhaps you can en-
lighten them. African-Americans

no longer want to be referred to as

“black.” Why? Simply, because
the negative connotations associ-
ated with the word are too many.

Cheer Like an
Immature 6. Year-Old

I was six years old and sitting
onthe bench in my Clorox clean Jr.
Raiders uniform when Joe Wytiaz
headed the game winning goal
against the much feared Jr. Sharks,
a team that featured Eddie
Yardumian, akid who had quickly
leamed that his 3’9’’ 68 pound
frame (there was speculated ste-
roid use) enabled him to truck
through smaller, immobile,
screaming kids
like myself. But

ally used the infamous Gregorian
victory chant to knock the team
into mindless submission. It went:
WE’RE GONNA WIN! WE’RE
GONNA WIN!

NYAH! NYAH! NYAH! NYAH!
NYAH! (The tongue sticks out at
this point.)

Nevermind the fact that at this
point we were usually hoping fora

In Black and White...
On Interracial

Dating (Part Two)

By Deidra Monatague
This counterpart to last week's
article oninterracial dating isfrom
Deidra’ s perspective.

There are some interracial
couples who care about each other
and want to build a future together.
However, in the grand scheme of
things, I think most couples who
are interracially “involved” do so
in order to satisfy their curiosity
about another race. If they’re in it
for that reason they need to come
correct. It’s not all about the myth
concerning black guys (didn’t you
hear... it’s not true). And it’s cer-
tainly not about the old story that
all black girls are promiscuous; in
fact, when I was growing up, I
always heard that white girls were
the ones that “‘put out.” For those
of you who seem surprised by this
myth, take it for what it actually is:
a myth.

T haven’t been involved in an
interracial relationship because I
prefer black guys. Don’t get me
wrong; you shouldn’t disregard
someone of a different race just
because. they’re different—
whether the relationship is on inti-
mate terms, or just friends, If that
were the case, I wouldn’t even be
at Davidson. (In case you’ve no-

ticed the campus is not exactly a
melting pot.) Even if there were a
white guy whom I found myself
attracted to, I would have reserva-
tions about dating him because of
the pressure.

That’s something I think a lot
of white people are surprised
about— when I say I, a black fe-
male, have qualms about interra-
cial dating. From my point of
view, italways seems like the topic
of conversation is “I would never
date a black guy/girl, because my
parents would have a heartache.”
And my reply is usually, “Well,
what makes you think that my par-
ents would jump for joy if brought
a white guy home? or even my
friends for that matter?”

It has to be understood that
interracial dating is not popular
with a lot of people on either side
of the podium. Both races consist
of people who think the entire other
race is bad, whether it be based on
stereotypes or too many bad expe-
riences. Chances are that we all
have at least two friends who be-
long to this group, and they can
make even the idea of race-mixing
a taboo subject.
