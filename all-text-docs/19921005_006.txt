the skyrocket-

Kuykendall, brought out the prob-
lems prevalent on campus. The
solutions suggested andcarried out
by this body, one which was com-
pletely in the right designating it-
self as an almost legislative body,
should be studied for years by world
leaders everywhere.

One of the direct results of this
committee’s efforts was the new
alcohol policy. This is a policy
that has been completely success-
ful in stopping all abuses of alco-
hol on the Davidson campus. Fra-

Don't Tread On Me:
I Hate the Cowboys

About this time you are prob-
ably drinking a few beers, and get-
ting ready for Monday Night Foot-
ball. This week the Philidelphia
Eagles (3-0) and the Dallas Cow-
boys (3-0) square off to determine
which team willremain undefeated.

When I wasa little boy grow-
ing up in Greenville, Mississippi, I
loved the Dallas Cowboys. This
was in the late seventies when the
Cowboys vs. Steelers rivalry was
inits heyday. I thought the Steelers
stood for everything that was bad
in the world, and the Cowboys
stood for everything that was good.
In the front yard I would pretend
that I was a player for the Cow-
boys. When I played quarterback,
I was Roger Staubach. When I ran
the ball, I was Tony Dorsett or

Robert Newhouse. When the oak

tree broke up on of my opponent’s
passes, I would say, “Ed Too Tall’

Jones with the deflection.” I loved
Cowboys, and I even cried when
they lost to the Steelers in 1978.
So why you might ask, do I
now hate the Dallas Cowboys. I
hate thie'Cowboys because of what
Jerry Jones, the current owner of
the team, did to Tom Landry. In the
March 6, 1989 issue of Sports II-
lustrated William Johnson wrote,
“The great stone face flinched and
the flinty blue eyes went glassy
when Tom Landry heard the ver-
dict: He had been summarily re-
moved ascoach of the Dallas Cow-
boys, after 29 years. There was no
appeal, no recourse, no room for
negotiation. Landry, 64, gazed in
shock at the two men who had
brought him the terrible news. He
said in disbelief, “You’ve taken
my. team away from me.” Jerry

A Friendly Word For the Owl

Welcome one and all to an-
other wonderful column. Would
you believe, as we begin this jour-
nalistic tour de force, we have ab-
solutely no idea what we’ll ulti-
mately end up saying.: Maybe you,
the humble reader, would think
that each week’s topic is carefully
crafted after much debate and edit-
ing. And, of course, you'd be
right. This week, however, we’ ve
decided to show ya’ll how we can
form a column out
of nothing (or noth-

example of exactly the kind of
impartial information source that
we strive to be (and soshould you);
he’s a fair-minded, level-headed
journalist who’ll give you those
additional facts about any given
story critical to objective decision-
making.

tously about George Bush and that

other creature in Mutual of

fittest, baby. And while the Spot-
ted Owl can crunch the bones of
any 1-4 pound animal in the forest,
it’srelatively puny when compared
to the hearty lumberjack. Further,
the hearty lumberjack’s children
get mighty hungry in
the course of a day.

Now, the hearty lum-
berjack can either feed
his (or her) children
with the fruits of hon-
est labor, cutting down
trees and replanting
saplings, or he (or she)
can feed them roasted
owl.

Both from an
environmental and so-
ciological perspective,
it’s better forthe hearty
lumberjack to cut and
replace trees than it is
for him (or her) to har-
vest Spotted Owls.

Highschool Bound

I'm sitting at the Pub, looking
downinto my beer, wondering why
anyone would give this stuffa blue
ribbon, when the thoughtoccurs to
me: my life has become very high
school.

The pimple fairy has come to
visit again, which is really annoy-
ing. I’m too old to be oxycuting
anything. And what I hate worse
are those dry-out-your-face pads.
Fresh tingle, my ass.

Even though I’m 21, people
have started telling me when and
where!’ mallowedto drink. Which,
considering the stuff I’m-quaffing
right now, and the headache I’ll
have tomorrow, is probably not
that bad an idea. But still, it’s the
principle (or should I say princi-
pal?) of the thing. Do I get deten-
tion if caught outside a designated

drinking area with acoldone? (I'll.

leave that alone now. Seems ey-
eryone has given that horse a good
whack already.)

I’m having crushes again. (I

debated putting this one in here.

move me from the dating market,

or: b.) everyone will think it’s
honest and cute and I’ll become a
commodity. I’ll take my chances.

kinder than nature her-
self by replacing the
owl’s habitat with new growth for-
est. The prey gets no second
chances. In addition, the baby
owls will have the added amuse-
ment of greater sunlight in the
mornings (and afternoons) with all

moved. While it may seem preda-
cious to cut down 500 year-old
trees, it’s clearly what nature in-
tended. Sorry folks, but plants and
animals can’t cut it in head to head
competition with humans (except
for the possible exception of the
lowly cockroach).

“Oh, yeah. . . life goes on.
Long after the thrill of livin’ is
gone.” By the way, wedid think of
somethin’ to write about. Aren’t
you glad?

Cliques are as strong as ever,
except this time they’re national
and have Greek names (or cam-
pus-wide and rich guy’s names.)

I’ve got a big red bike. After
class the other day, I called up a
friend and asked, “want to ride
bikes?” I don’t think I’ve said that
since 8th grade.

Those damned standardized
tests are back for an encore. |
thought the SAT was it. I dis-
tinctly remember someone prom-
ising me that. But, no. Now there
are more, and they’re doozics.
MCATs, LSATS. No “winging
it” on those babies.

And all of this
highschoolishness wouldn’t be so
bad, except that I’m about done
with college. Ihave justas little of
an idea now of what to"do with
myself as I did in 12th grade, ex-
cept now it’s crunch time.

The horror is that I could be
