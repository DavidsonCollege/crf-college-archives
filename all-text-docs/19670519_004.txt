COORDINATION NECESSARY
Officers Base Decisions On Funds, People

Money and people are the
basic concerns of the Trea

Major decisions for the in

from the Board of Trustees.
Currie said. For instance. the
recent decision to change in-
vestment counsel was initiat-
ed by the trustees. Currie
carried out the details of this
involved
some portfolio changes.

In addition to his handling
the investment of funds, Cur-
rie prepares the operating
budget for the college. He
balances budget requests with
his estimates of the income of
the college for the coming
year. Currie is involved with
decisions of ‘give and take.”

not say what the endowment

it does make recommenda-
tions,” Currie said.

Currie pointed out the co-
ordination that must go on be-
tween his office and that of

Coordination is the keynote
for Robert J. Sailstad. direc-
tor of public relations and de--
velopment.

“It's difficult to separate
public relations, alumni ac-
tivities and development.
They're all closely related.”
Sailstad said.

Under the revised struc-
ture of the college, the Direc-
tor of Alumni Activities and
the Director of Public infor-
mation report directly to
Sailstad’s office. In turn, the
Dircetor of Public Relations
and Development reports to
the President.

‘All that is of interest and
benefit to the college is pub-
licized."" Sailstad indicated,
when talking about the pub-

that went into the current Ford
Challenge campaign reflects
the second type of decision that
Sailstad must make. Securing
money for college develop-
ment is part of the job of be-
ing director of development.

Careful planning accounts
for a program of fund raising
that “doesn't fluctuate,”’ ac-
cording to Sailstad. The stra-
tegy. so to speak, was mapped
out in advance.

In the area of public rela-

education. Sailstad used as
examples the Executive Week.

in another aspect, there are
projects for the advancement
of the college as a Ilberal arts
center for its area. By keep-

college can entertain “guests”
