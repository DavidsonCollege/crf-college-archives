When asked to elaborate on
the conditions surrounding the
recent administrative changes
in the office of alumni and
public relations, Martin ex-

| plained that the persons involv-
| ed had been notified last spring
| of the college's intention to com-
| bine the Office of Development
with that of Alumni and Public
Relations.

John Horton who was at that
time serving as acting director
of the almuni office was asked
to become assistant dean of
| students. Horton declined the
position. Horton had been with
the college for four years.

“«

While Horton was designated
in college publications as direc:
tor of alumni and public rela-
tions, he was on an acting basis.
His position with the college was
renewed each year. His. status
was such that unless his contract
was extended it would termin-
ate at the year's end.

On the topic of the new cut
system, Martin commented that
the new policy was enacted by

‘the faculty so that the initiative

in this area could be placed
more squarely on the students.
He emphasized that the 25%
limit that has been in effect
since the founding of the col-
lege was still a’ part of the ab-
sence regulations, and that any
cuts in excess of this 25% limit
would bring a failing grade in
the particular course overcut.
