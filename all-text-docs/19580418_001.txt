Study Honor Council

At the meeting of the Student Council Monday
night, discussion centered around the proposed Honor
Council. The Honor Council Committee recommended
that there be 11 members on the Honor Council. This
would mean that at every trial there would be 9 voting
members, a prosecutor, and a defense.

Next year the class would
choose two additional men to

Prompted By Recent
Events, Says Jones

The Interfraternity Council this week announced
passage of a resolution declaring traditional Hell Week
activities at Davidson permanently abolished. IFC Pres-
ident Bob Jones in explaining the council action re-
marked that the resolution was “precipitated by what
happened to’ Hell Week this Year.”

Jones said that the IFC would
promote “a more constructive
program” for fraternity pre-ini-
ation ceremonies next year. He
expressed approval of widely
popular “Greek Week” festivi:
ties or a Help Week similar
to that sponsored by Alpha Tau
Omega fraternity at Davidson.

The IFC resolution was passed
in a meeting shortly before
spring recess and was present-
ed to the fraternity faculty com-
mittee and the entire college
faculty for approval. The facul-
ty, while taking no formal legis-
lative action, concurred with

next year. He remarked that
money from fraternity fines
collected recently will be used
to undertake a study of Greek
Week festivals and to formulate
plans for next year’s activities.
The Hell Week ruling, said
Jones, is in keeping with the
policies of national offices for

ell Week Completely Abolished

Must Establish Closer
Student Relations

By DICK SMITH
Davidsonian Managing Editor
“Formation of the Honor Council, I am afraid, is
impractical this year, but it will be instituted at the

beginning of next year.”

There were the words of stu-
dent body president-elect John
Kuykendall at a luncheon with
members of the DAVIDSONIAN
staff early this week. He went
on to explain, ‘A committee ap-
pointed by this year's Council
made several recommendations
to the Council last week. The
main point of the report was
that since the Honor Council
is to be a separate body from
the Student Council itself, sepa-
rate elections for positions on
the Honor Council should be
held.” Kuykendall asserted that
this spring's elections had gone
too far for an Honor Council
election to be held this year
with the priority to which it
is entitled.

Q. How did the committee ar-
rive at its recommendation?

A. Mainly by writing other
colleges such as UNC, Duke,
and Elon, which already have
Honor Councils in action,

Davidson Students

At NSA Conference!

Tommy Colvin, Ervin Duggan,
and Bill Bondurant recently at-
tended the Regional Conference
of the National Student Asso-
ciation held at Randolph-Macon
College in Lynchburg, Virginia.

As delegates to the confer-
ence, they took part in a num.
ber of discussion mectings con-
cerning the theme of the con-
ference: student responsibilities
in higher education.

The discussions dealt with
ways and means of developing
student interest in such areas
of education as student counsel-
ling services, honors courses,
curriculum evaluation, and re-
cruitment of future teachers.
Delegates from schools which
do not have educational facili-
ties such as our own student
counselling service were en-
couraged to set up student com-
mittees in their schools to
arouse student interest in the
need for these facilities.

The delegates also discussed
means for creating student in
terest in the intellectual po-

and asking their advice and
opinion.

COUNCIL FORMATION

Q. What is your plan for the
formation of the Council?

A. 1 think that the formation
should take place in three steps.
The first would have the Honor
Council sitting in on Student
Council trials. The second
would let the Honor Council
try the cases, with members of
the Student Council sitting in
as advisors. The third would be
the complete assumption of
trials by the Honor Council,
with the president of the Stu-
dent Body present at all trials
as a non-voting member.

Q. What would be the appeal
procedure of a student convict-
ed by the Honer Council?

A. The procedure would be
exactly as it is now. The stu-
dent could appeal to the Facul-
jty Committee on Appeals. If the
committee rejects the convic-
tion, the trial would be brought
before the faculty as a whole
for further action. If the com-
mittee upheld the Honor Coun-
cil's decision, the student would
have the right to appeal the
case directly to the faculty. No
appeal could be made to the
Student Council.

Q. How is trial procedure de-
termined?

A. In the past, the procedure
has been based solely on past
trials. I would like to see a writ-
ten procedure available to the
Honor Council, and this is one
thing I plan to do in the com-
ing year.

VESPER CONDUCT

Q. What is your opinion on
Vesper conduct?

A. I define deplorable Ves-
pers conduct to be that conduct
which hinders the worship of
others. In the two main offenses
this year, the conduct was
definitely deplorable. However,
I would say that in the last
month or so the conduct has im-
proved considerably. If it again
becomes bad, I think that it is
jthe Student Council's respon-
‘sibility to punish offenders, al-
Lthough I don't have a definite
plan in mind. I shalt say.

The Honor Council Commit-
tee recommended that the clec-
tions be held in the following

j tentials of college life. The stu-!though, that if the need arises

sermuda Story Ends At Davidson

Bermudas will be in vogue this week-
end. It is therefore entirely fitting and
proper that a summary of the history
of Bermudas be set down. After reading
this summary the sophisticated David-
sonian can thrill his date with his ex-
tensive knowledge.

The noted historian Chalmers Da-

vidson, in his latest book, An Historian’s
Approach to the Bermudas of the

Pithecanthropi, says: “Bermudas were
first used by the Pithecanthropi because
of the usefulness of the buckle for dang-
ling from and swinging back and forth
on limbs. The Pithecanthropus also
found the buckle useful for dragging
home his mate after the annual spring
frolic. ‘It is well to note, however, that

the Bermudas of this time consisted of
only the buckle.”

But, as man progressed, so did Ber-
mudas. There was great tumult in Rome
the day Julius Caesar stood up in a
smoke-filled Senate and uttered those
immortal words, ‘“Alenda Lux Ubi Orta
Libertas."’ It seems that Julius was set-
ting the style by wearing the first of
the skirt-type Bermudas.

Prior to this time the Bermudas had

been ROTC brown to blend with un-.

washed skin. Cleopatra, in one of her
revolutionary moods, suggested that
Caesar wear white skirt-type Bermudas.
Julius, unlike the virile Davidsonian,
bowed to her wishes and decreed that
only the emperor could wear them.

By P. SYDNEY YATES

For those who enjoy playing with dolls, their Bermuda
shorts are ready to be cut out and put on.

This special DAVIDSONIAN service is offered in view of
possible short-short shortages during Spring Frolics.

It was for this reason that Brutus
killed him. Caesar’s famous “Et tu
Brute?” was said when he saw Brutus
approach him wearing white Bermudas.

The skirt-type Bermudas were worn
until the time of Napoleon Bonaparte.
When Napoleon reached Moscow in the
1812 campaign, he decided that he
should sew legs into his skirt, since the
cold Russian wind created a very un-
pleasant’ draft. ,

(The reader should note that the
Scottish kilts are descended from
Caesar’s Bermudas. The wind of Scot-
land has not proved as drafty as the
Russian wind.)

Peter Stewart Ney, “a mysterious
Frenchman respected for his learning,”
carried so many documents to prove that

he was Napoleon’s Marshal Ney that
he had to sew containers onto his Bermu-
das before he reached Davidson. These
containers developed into the side-poc-
kets of the present Bermudas.

Slick John Cunningham, noted nu-
mismatician, added the rear pocket in
order to carry around endowment pa-
pers and other useful objects he ac-
quired.

Thus the Bermudas have developed
to what they are today. There will be a
variety of colors, sizes, and shapes loose
on the Davidson campus this weekend,
some of which may prove interesting to
behold. But, if the Davidson weather is
consistent, many legs will flee from the
discomfort of our local version of short-
shorts.
