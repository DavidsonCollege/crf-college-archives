Sanford For Governor

We are distyrbed by the strange up-
swing in sentiment favoring the Re-
publican candidate for governor in
North Carolina, Robert L. Gavin.

When some five hundred Republi-
cans got together somewhere in Ral-

eign last spring and decided to let
Gavin run for governor, nobody
thought that he would be running
neck and neck with Terry Sanford in
November.

We liked Bob Gavin when he was
here to speak in early October. He is
a personable, unassuming man, and
we were a little sorry that he had to
run. against a smooth, astute. articu-
late pro like Sanford.

But we're not going to vote for
Gavin because we don't think he can
get the job done. He couldn’t get the
job done even if he had Terry. San-
ford’s experience and political savvy.

Let’s picture Bob Gavin as governor
of North Carolina. He would be faced

with a hostile Democratic General
Assembly. His program, such as it is.
would disintegrate without sustained

legislative action. We don’t feel that
Gavin is politician enough to push his
bills through an opposition legisla-
ture. On top of that, he is likely to be
saddled with a Democratic Council of
State.

But what if people who vote for
Gavin vote a straight Republican
ticket? Wouldn't this give him a Re-
publican cabinet and a few legisia-
tors? Yes, but we don’t think many
will.

Ever heard of the young Republican
who is opposing Thad Eure for Secre-
tary of State? His name is David Mor-
ton, he’s 37 years old and he’s man-
ager of the Homelite office in Char-

lotte. He’s also in the Toastmaster'’s
Club. Eure is a veteran, popular state

politician who has been Secretary of
State for twenty-three years.

Dr. Charles F. Carroll has been
superintendant of three city school
systems and has served as state Sup-

erintendent of. Public Instruction
Since 1952. His competition for the

post is Mrs. Mary Jo Zachary. She’s
an ex-school teacher from Yadkin-
ville. She has never held a state of-
fice, but She’s a member of the PTA
and she says that she believes in an

improved sehoo] system.

And it’s that way down the whole
slate: a veteran Democratic public
servant against a well-meaning Re-
publican amateur. In many counties,

candidates for the House of Repre-
sentatives run unopposed.

But what about the men themselves .

—Sanford and Gavin? Sanford is a

former state senator, member of the
Ports Authority, and. past president
of the North Carolina Young Demo-
crats. Gavin is a former U.S. District
Attorney but has never held a state
elective office.

Sanford has conducted a fairly sane
campaign. His program has been
thoroughly planned and constructed.
He is well informed and has taken
a straightforward, progressive stand
on the issues. He will enjoy a reason-
able amount of support from the Gen-
eral Assembly.

Gavin, on the other hand. has shown
himself to be misinformed on basic
facts of the education issue. He chid-
ed Sanford for free-spending, and in
almost the same breath advocated a
50 per cent raise in teachers’ pay,
which would amount to 65 million
dollars a year.

He compared the ‘state Democratic
administration to Castro's Cuban gov-
ernment, but could back it up only
with a vague letter to employees of
the Highway Department.

He has repeatedly reversed and
equivocated his position on key is-
sues.

Then why are people going to vote
for: him?

Many don’t care for Sanford’s un-
qualified endorsement of Senator
John F. Kennedy.’ Many frustrated

supporters of I. Beverly Lake have
shifted to Gavin more for spite than

any intelligent reason. And Gavin is

riding a wave of two-party sentiment
in the state.

It’s time North Carolinians woke
up to the real issues in the guberna-
torial election. Two party politics is
fine, but the movement won't get very
far with Robert L. Gavin.

We endorse Terry Sanford with the
confidence that he is the right man
for the job.

The Court's Last Chance

The Student Council this year has
shown on several occasions a quality
of maturity in its openness to self-
criticism. A couple of weeks ago, the
Council willingly re-examined its
stand requesting the administration
to “liberalize” vesper cuts and decid-
ed after further consideration that its
initial action had been hasty. They
then withdrew the request.

At their last meeting, the council-
men again paused to re-examine their
actions, this time concerning the
Court of Control (See article on page
1).

We are gratified to see the Council
examine all sides of this problem and
Set its goal on providing a workable
and valuable Court of Control. We

would like to offer our ideas for con-
sideration.

To function properly, the court
must have the respect of the student
body. We have seen in the past that
when this respect is lacking the court
flounders in a sea of indifference on
the part of upperclassmen and rebel-
lion (from freshmen and upperclass-
men reformers). In large part, the
court has failed to win respect be-
cause of its choice of methods by
which to achieve its ends,

We submit that there is a world
of difference between firmness and
bulliness. In its “lean” years, the
court has been a bully organization.

When we consider methods of pro-
viding an effective court program,
we toss our support to a court com-
posed of members of the Student
Council. We support a court that will
not indict a suspect—before he has
been proven guilty or not guilty—in
front of the whole student body. We
support the more constructive fresh-
man regulations and we favor penal-
ties strong enough to make a fresh-
man think twice before breaking the
rules. Above all, we would encourage
upperclass support of the new pro-
gram.

We would like to see a firm court,
one whose explicit business is to build
a class of freshmen which will become
a part of the college and uphold the
traditions of the college.

This is a pretty large order, and so
far, no court has been able to fill it.
The Student Council seems to be on
the right track in searching for a so-

lution. We hope they can succeed.
They are the court’s last chance.

Nearly cight thousand uni-
versity, college, and prep
school students in institutions
in five states favor Nixon over
Kennedy. .

During the past three weeks,
THE DAVIDSONIAN has com-
piled the results of polls on
twelve campuses.

NINE FAVOR GOP

The students polled endorsed
the Republican ticket with 55
per cent of their total vote. The
Democrats trailed with 42 per
cent.

Of the eleven schools which
sent results of their student

DAVIDSONIAN, nine favored
Nixon and only two supported

Kennedy.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Let’s Talk These Matters Over,
Reader Urges Faculty, Students

Mansell

Dear Editor:

For some time now a state
of war has prevailed between
faculty and students over the
Yeaternity system. The faculty
has waved the big stick of sop-
homore rush, and the fraterni-
ties have responded with half-
hearted resolutions and propos-
als which don’t hold water.

How tong will this con-
tinue? Until everyone real-
izes that this is not the way
fo go about making construc-
tive changes!

Dr. Lehmann stated in one
of his informal discussions that
there should be a healthy and
continuing dialogue between
faculty and fraternities. This
means sitting down together to
discuss matters of common con-
cern. It means being willing to
seriously evaluate the purposes
of these two groups and the
means by which these purposes
are achieved.

If there is objection to or
question about some phase of
the programs, let that phase be
laid open and discussed pro and

some element of a system out
weigh the reasons for it, then
mutually agree that a change
is necessary. In the same man-
ner, when reasons in favor out
weigh arguments against, it
can be safely concluded that
part of the program is the best
possible at the present time.

Can't faculty and students
sit down and discuss matters
serlously end intelligently?
It will mean that both parties
will have to be willing to
compromise and give in a
little on cecasions for the
good of the entire campus.
This is the way it ought to
be.

Let's agree on a continuing
state of peaceful dialogue, rath-

er than unconditional victory
or defeat for either party.
W. Frank Mansell, Jr.

Elvery

Dear Editor:

I believe your sports editor
stepped out of line on October
14 when he played with politics
in his ditty entitled “Two
‘Sports’ for President.” Not
only did he politic but he com-
mitted the unpardonable sin of
slandering RICHARD E. (sic)
NIXON by not presenting the
full picture.

In his attempt to portray
Kennedy as an athlete, he failed
to note NIXON played football
for Whittier College. I sincere-
ly hope in the future you will
keep politics on the editorial
page and sports slone on the

sports page.

constellation Leo, the Lion,
ruled by the Sun, because this
constellation was crossing the
eastern horizon (Ascendant) at
the stated time of birth.
FAVORS KENNEDY
There is a remarkable triple
conjunction of Mars, Mercury,
and Jupiter in the natal horo-
seopes of both Kennedy and
Nixon.

John Fitzgerald Kennedy was
born May 29, 1917 at Brookline,
Massachusetts, 42N20, 71W08.
Thus he was born under the
rising of the constellation Virgo,
making Mercury his ruling
‘star.’

The four pairs of astrologi-
cal charts for November 8 must
be computed for the actual
place of residence of Nixon and
Kennedy on that date. We have
no option but to compute all
quotidians for the exact  geo-
graphical co-ordinates of Wash-
ington, D. C. on the assump-
tion that they will both be
there at noon EST.

Nixon’s natal quotation (N.
Q)—his ordinary progressed
horoscope, corrected by the Bi-
ja—shows the progressed moon
applying to the direct opposi-
tion of Saturn, which is close
to the Midheaven. Transiting
Pluto is in opposition to the
progressed Sun.

The progtessed Jupiter, sig-
nificator of (one’s status and
prestige, suffers the transits of
the. two malefics Mars and Sat::
urn in mutual opposition. The
transiting Uranus is on the As-:
cendent, ‘and no benefics are’
in the immediate foreground.

BAD FOR DICK

These movements look very
ominous for Nixon.

Examining Nixon's regressed
horoscope (NQ Reg.), we note
two situations. First, the Re-
gressed Sun is in exact opposi-
tion to regressed Saturn. Sec-
ond, transiting Venus is on re-
gressed Jupiter and Mercury is

organized study, of study, of extracurricular activities.
In their place stands a Davidson man: bleary-eyed, un-

next class, sleeping, eating, and leaving at every op-

portunity.
