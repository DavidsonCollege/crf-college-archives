CAT-TALES

By TONI CASALI

Davidson's varsity looked impressive for the first time this season
last Friday when they took Erskine’s measure with a rousing 33-0 win.
Their running plays were run with perfection, and every man; on the
field looked good. If there could be any stars picked ou of the affair,
certainly Archie ‘Steed, Bill Davis and Tubby Hand should be named.

Steed made the fans forget Teeny Lafferty ever existed. At the
beginning of the second quarter he slashed off-tackle, cut out toward
the sideline, and scampered 65 yards downfield to score standing, up.
Later in the second half fhe scored again on a beautiful 28 yard Yun
behind some nice blocking on the part of his teammates. Davis looked
good. Not only did he carry the pigskin 14 times for a net gain of
94 yards but he attempted cight passes and completed five for a total
of 128 yards. Hand, who has been somewhat overlooked in the past,
started the scoring after a series of line-plunges brought the ball up to
the eight-yard stripe. In fact all of the 'Cat backs looked good—they
rolled up 345 yards from scrimmage in 49 plays. <

Not even with such a brilliant performance by the backfield, could
the line be overshadowed. They held Erskine’s speedy backs in check,
and when the game was over figures showed that they had thrown

The varsity, even though they did

Last week this columnist made a futile attempt to pick winners of
last Saturday's games. But after hearing the scores Saturday night, no
attempt was made to see how the guesses were. Also several members
of the student body didn’t agree with the selections, so this week new
hands will attempt to “guess” the outcome. If you don’t agree with
the selection see either Rut Miller, Harry Gasteiger or Blair Miller (all

Seceders Threaten Late in Game With Passes — Every Man

A surging, — black-jersied
horde of Davidson Wildcats,
scoring in every period, over-
whelmed an Erskine team that
could plot no defense to stop
them here last Friday after-
noon by a 33-0 count.

Davidson ran and passed her way
to victory over her lighter oppon-
ents behind excellent blocking. Bill
Davis and Archie Steed shone as
the Wildcat tailbacks with Bill Bo-
lin doing a great job of blocking.
Tubby Hand cracked the line for
first downs time and again while
Fred Stair helped vary the attack
with some fancy pass-snagging.
The Wildcats’ first came
midway the first period, when Da-
and Hand advanced the ball
from Erskine’s 38 to their 4 in six
plays, where the hard-driving Hand
plunged over to score. Im the open-
ing minutes of the third period

pitched one again, this time to Stair

raced the remaining 15 to score.
