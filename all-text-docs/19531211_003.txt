“Draught Ends On
Davidson Desert,” thus
read the headlines of
Wednesday evening's
Charlotte News. Much
-to the pleasure of an
overjoyed student
body, the event that
this head was herald-
ing was, of course, the
Red and Black cagers’
victory over South
Carolina on Tuesday
night which ended Da-
vidson's 33-game ma-
jor sports victory
famine. The Cats did
themselves proud and
bore no resemblance to the team which provoked such a tirade
of dissenting comments last week.

When things started to turn in Davidson’s favor midway
in the second stanza of Tuesday’s encounter this reporter was
delighted to discover that there still is that old Davidson spirit
which has become almost a myth remaining on ‘“Davidson’s
Desert.” The high spirited response that the win produced
was not only enough to rock the gym, but pretty well rocked
the whole campus before the evening was over. One stu-
dent upon digging out from under his stack of books in the
library and stepping outside for a breath of air was greeted
with such a roar from Johnston’s win-starved walls that he
knew that the. Cats must be pulling the impossible—a win
for Davidson.

At game time the stands were sparcely populated with
an only about half-capacity crowd, but as the cheers of these

WILDCAT OF THE WEEK :

Keith Found ‘Eye’
Against SC Birds

There he goes into that ball game . . . he fires five times
and five times he connects before he misses a shot . . . before
the evening is over the baffled opponents see 18 points be-

victory since last spring! The opponent—South Carolina; the
sport—basketball; the player—Graeme Keith, our Wildcat of
the Week. —_eSSSSoaooaae

showed itself in a game. Inserted
at a crucial moment by Coach
Miller, this lean senior center sunk
his first attempt and then was off
to the races as he kept the score-
keepers busy.

Keith also turned in a fine per-
formance in helping to control
the backboards for the Cats.
These two things, coupled with his
fine defensive showing made our
choice of this weeks W of W easy.

Open Conference Action

SAEs Cop Swimming |{

Crown In Close Win

After trailing far behind the
Sigma Chis and Phi Delts in the
early part of the meet, the SAEs
took three Ist places and two 2nd
places in the last five events as
they jumped into the lcad. They
were still one point behind going
into the final event, with the Phi
Delts in front and the Sigma Chis
tied for the second position.

Four new records were set in
this year’s meet, which had eight
events. This easily indicates the
caliber of the swimmers in the
meet.

In the first event, the 150-yard
Medley Relay, the Sigma Chis set
a new record of 1:33.65. The old
record of 1:37.7 was set by another
Sigma Chi team in 1951.

In the 75-yard Free Style, Billy
Carrell, who just recently pledged
Sigma Chi, broke the record set
in Monday’s time trials by Rivers
(Phi Delt). Carrell’s time was 41.7,
chopping 1.6 seconds from the old
record. Carrell. also set a new
record in the 75-yard Individual
Medley. Abernathy (Kappa Sigma)
set the old record of :50.3 just last
year. Carrell’s time was :48.4.

The SAEs broke the record set
last year by the Phi Delts in the
200-yard Free Style Relay. The
old record was 1:50.3 and the
SAEs cut .3 seconds from it.

In the 50-yard Breast Stroke,
Edwards (Beta) edged out Trotti
(KA) for first place. Pressly (Sig-
ma Chi) and Norton (SAE) tied
for first place in the 50-yard Back
Stroke, which was the closest
event of the evening. Ed Spiers
(SAE) won the 50-yard Free Style
and 25-yard Free Style.

In Monday night’s time trials,
three records were set. Rivers
(Phi Delt) set a new record in the
75-yard Free Style (however, this
lasted only until Wednesday). In
the 50-yard Back Stroke, Ed Spier
set a new record of :25.3. In the
50-yard Back Stroke, Norton (SAE)
and Pressley (Sigma Chi) tied in
setting a new time of :33.5.

Senior stalwarts who are leading the Wildcat efforts in the

AU Wrestling Finale
Scheduled Here Tonight

Again this year, the Carolinas A.A.U. Wrestling Cham-
pionships will be held at Davidson, December 10th and 11th.
The preliminary will start at 8:00 p.m. Thursday, with the
semi-finals at 2:00 p.m. Friday, and the finals at 8:00. Weigh-
ing in will be from 5:00 p.m. until 6:00 p.m., on Thursday,
and again between 12:00 and 1:00 on Friday. Consolation
matches will be run off at 7:30 p.m. Friday.

Since last year’s Camp Lejeune
Marine champions will not defend
their title, both Cherry Point and
Davidson, last year's runner-ups,
will have a good chance at the
team title. Davidson will enter
both a varsity and a freshman
team, about 25 men all told.
Cherry Point is bringing 19, the
High Point YMCA 12, and 1 comes
from the Charleston Naval Base.

Last year, Bobby Joe Key and
Kerry Spiers finished in that order
at 114.5, Charles Murray was
fourth at 136.5, and second, third
and fourth at 191.5 went respec-
tivezy to Dave Burns, Nabby Arm-
field, and Henry Faison for Da-
vidson. David Brown, who wrestled
as an independent last year in the
161.5 class, will be one of the top
contenders for the team.

Under the Olympic Wrestling
Rules, bouts will be 10 minutes in
length. H, after four minutes, one
wrestler has at least a two point
advantage, he can choose whether
or not to go the remaining six
minutes without interruption, or
to split the remaining time into
three two-minute periods. [If no
one has the two-point advantage,
the three-period alternative is
taken. Perhaps the chief differ-
ence between collegiate rules and
the Olympic rules is the defini-
tion of a fall. In this tournament,
it _is necessary only to force the
opponent’s shoulder to touch the
mat. Regular college rules say that '

the shoulders have to be held
there for two consecutive seconds.

a sparkling win over the powerful
University of South Carolina’s
Gamecocks, will be host to a very
strong V.P.J. team on Saturday
night. The Wildcats, after taking
their first win in four starts, will
be out to take the game but will
definitely be the underdogs. A
packed house is expected to wit-
ness the Cat Southern Conference
debut.
Keith Big Gun

The man who will be carrying
most of the hopes of the Cats in
their Saturday night tilt, is big
Graeme Keith. Graeme missed the
games with Wake Forest and State
and didn’t start in the South
Carolina game due to __ illness.
However, when the occasion arose
in the second quarter, Graeme re-
placed Melton and began hitting.
With amazing accuracy, he hit on
eight of twelve shots and racked
up eighteen points for the night
to give the Cats the punch they
needed for their first victory of
the season.

It was not a one man show, how-
ever, while Keith was setting the
pace, Ish Bennett hit five out of
eight shots and collected thirteen

.| points to rank second in the scor-

ing. Hobby Cobb dropped in twelve
points and collected ten rebounds.

Davidson, N. C.

Defense Was Key
The performances of Brown and
Cobb on the rebounding along
with a tight defense by the team
as a whole were big factors in
the victory. South Carolina, who
had beaten Georgia Tech and
Georgia while losing only to Mary-
land by three points, was baffled
by the defense until the last quar-
ter when they cut the Wildcats’
lead in half.
Fine Team Effort
It was a fine team effort for the
Cats who immediately began work-
ing for the VPI encounter with a
stress on the free throw line. The

Cats were weak at the line in the
second half and this was one of |
the factors in the slicing of their
lead. With the Gamecocks trying
to break the Cats’ defense and a
press employed in the last quar-
ter, the Cats had seventeen at-
tempts at the line in the second
half and only hit on eight.

The same starting team com-
posed of Buddy Brown and Ish
Bennett at guards, Hobby Cobb
and Ray Harding at forwards, and
Captain Graeme Keith at center
is slated to open against the Gob-
blers tomorrow night.
