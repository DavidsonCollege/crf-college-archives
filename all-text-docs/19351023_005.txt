THEME IS FAITH IN GOD

J... Hardy,

“Let us be able to
ready now,’” quoted Dr.
pastor of the Second Presbyterian
Church of Charlotte, speaker at the Ves-
per Church services last Sunday evening.

Faith in God will support and save
man. Satan strikes man at his strongest
point and at an unguarded moment. Only
faith in God can save us, and this faith
is eternal,” continued the speaker.

“Our life can be compared with the
life of Simon Peter, and his -fall. Satan
wants us in the same way that he desired
Peter. Are we going to waver as he did?

“The Master warns and the
boasts; the man falls, and the
lives. This is our everyday. Man is given
a chance to hear the call and word
God. If he is a weakling, Satan carries
him off. Only the strong can escape him.

“God puts a value on every man and
woman, Each one of us is worthy of the
death of God’s own son.

to make group pictures of the fra-
ternities, the Pan-Hellenic Council,
and other honorary fraternities. At
this time he will take the individual

Members of the annual staff said
that the system of paying in advance
for pictures in the yearbook has
proved most satisfactory.

ings of the year on October
The Eumenean Society had a feed
a program of two papers read by mem

bers. The Prisoner was the title of tne
paper written and read by Fitz Dade. It
deals with a little-known episode in the

life of that ruthless but shrewd conqueror,

Genghis Khan. “The Young Temudjin,”
captured by a band of raiders from Sa-
marcand, escaped and fled to an oasis
Here he barely escaped from his pur-
suers and from the death which they
would have dealt. The paper shows how
the destiny of nations hangs by such a
thin thread of chanee.

The ‘Modern Alchemist was the title

John

and

of the paper read and written by
D. Allen. This was an imaginative

humorous satire upon the chemical lab-

oratory. It told of a trip to the Martin
Chemical Laboratory and amusing ex
periences there. The students tried to
make experiments come out correctly but
always something prevented this. Allen
describes very humorously the terrible
odors, the deadly poisons, and other

imaginary horrors which occurred in the
various rooms.

On the program for the next meeting

meeting will be held Tuesday, October
