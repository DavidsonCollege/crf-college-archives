LECTURE ON CHINA

GIVEN IN SHEARER HALL BOOKS.-STATIONARY-NOVELTIES

Brockmann’s

Mrs. Gary Lee gave an_ interesting

and instructive lecture on China, Sat-
urday evening, October 13, in Shearer
Hall. Mrs. Lee was assisted in

program by several of the tow nspeople

dressed as Chinese.

Mrs, Lee spoke of four phases of |
Chinese life—Industry, Economy. Tem-
perance and Stability.

“The marvellous economy of the Chi-
nese is shown in the way they save on all
things,” says Mrs. Lee. “Even a single
grain of rice is picked up by a small
child. The children are trained in econ-
omy from the time they can walk. Their
diet is the simplest but very nourishing.”

China’s industry is unparalleled in the
history of any nation. They make the
most of everything. Every spare mo-
ment is turned to some employment.

Mrs. Lee attributes the great brains
and strong badies of the Chinese to their
economy and industry.

The Chinese are a very temperate peo-
ple. Many years ago strong drink was
wiped out of China hy an order of the
Emperor. The opium trade was: forced
on her by England, with the sword and
through the agency of the Fast, India
company, says Mrs. Lee. ‘That China
is peace-loving has .heen adequately
shown in the present world-war.

Her stability is unquestioned, because
of her resources and her industry. Her
stability is compared to that of Stone
Mountain, in Georgia.

All through her talk Mrs. Lee show-
ed her sense of humor by comparisons
of manners and dress of the Chinese to
those of the Americans. She very hu-
morously scored the present style of even-
ing gowns worn by American women.

POTEAT SPEAKS
TO THE Y.

DR.
M.C. A.

“Christianity is in greater danger than
it has ever been since the Saracen in-
vasion,” Dr. Poteat, President of Fur-
man University, told those who were
present at the Y. M. C. A. on Friday
night.

He related brietly his reasons for be-
lieving this, and spoke of the great work
that the Y. M. C. A. is doing among the
men in the camps of our country and
else, is giving to our fighting men, that
it is doing he said that it, like nothing
else, is giving to uor fighting men, that
touch of home and religion that keeps
them clean and fearless.

As the outcome of the war means
much to the cause of Democracy and
Christianity, he showed that we must do
our part in keeping the work of the Y.
M. C. A. going. He then told them of
a great campaign that is being launched
thruout our country. He appealed to
them as Davidson men to-help the col-
leges of the South raise their part, which
is $100,000. And to do it with the same
spirit of sacrifice that our brothers have
shown in entering this great war.

STEAM PIPE BEHIND
RUMPLE IS REPLACED

Altho the steam heating pipes of
Rumple had been in service only ten
years, it was found necessary to replace
the drain pipe. This necessitated the
shutting off of the steam, but now every-
thing is ready for the winter and no
more trouble is anticipated.
