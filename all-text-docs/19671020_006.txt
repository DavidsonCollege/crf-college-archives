For Improvement

A report on the College Un-
Ton, presented to the Board
of Trustees last week. sug
gested improvernents for the
Union programs and faeill-
ties.

The report was compiled
by the Board of the Cotlege
Union on the basis of a stu:
dent survey,

According to Ed Embece.
vice prenident of the College
Union Board, the survey that
was the basis for the report
was: completed last spring by

helping the Bourd evaluate

Embrec.

Embree said that the goal

freshmen.

The students who were sur

suggestions for improve.
ment. They generally agreed
that the Union is trying hard,
but about 80 per cent of them
felt that it “heeds to be im-
proved greatly.’

Some suggestions for im-
provement included the add-
ing of kitchenettes, a card
room, a large banquet room
‘and several small lounges.
The main reason for the
poor service in the snack bar
is the lack of space, accord-
ing to Embree. The most
common temédy suggested by
students was the building of

”® separate snack bar area
whieh would provide letter
service and a wider selection
of foods.

Several students suguested
4 ‘Union Rathskeller which
would serve short ordce dish
es, beer, wine and possibly
provide some type of infor:
mal entertainment."

The survey also dealt with
the students’ evaluation of
the present programs spon-
sored by the Union. Most of
the students thought that the

Runyan Hits Religion Of Escape,
Terms Hope Vital To Existence

By RICH COWART
Stet? Welter

“Man is that creature who
hopes,’ said De. Theodore
Runyan, professor of theology
at Emory University, 19
chapel Thursday. “Without
hope we would cease to
exist.”

Runyan pointed out the
necessity of including an ale-
anent of hope in religion. “‘Re-
ligkon has traditionally been
merely a glorification of the
status quo.’ he said. ‘‘ehar-
acterized by its abltlity to

sprinkle holy water on exist-
Ing Institutions.’

But by concentrating on the
past, and on a preservation of
the present, .a religion comes
to be simply an escape from
the problems of life, and not
an answer to them.

Christianity, Runyan said,
has turned from its original
outlook and has become “just
another status quo religion,”
offering a refuge from the
problems facing our society,
but not helping to end these
problems.

Teachers Assess
Student Influence

By Collegiate Press Sorvicn

WASHINGTON — The nation's leading educators
are beginning to accept the idea that students should
be actively involved in the decisions which affect their

education.

They are undecided, however, about just how far
this involvement should be extended and are worried
about its effects on such practical matters as relations
with trustees. legislators, the public and the very
education which their institutions provide.

involvement = in
making

Student
academle decision

was 4 frequent tople as some.

1,700 ndministrators of col-
leges and univeraiiies across
dhe country gathered here
this month for the 80th ane
nual meeting of the American
Council on Education (ACE).

And although most of the
college presidents and other,
executives who participated
in the program endorsed
significant student pnrticipn-
tion in the governing of aca-
demic _ institutions, there
nevertheless seemed to be an
undercurrent fear of the stu-
dent activist movement and
of the cries for student power,

This fear and concern about
the future was evident from
the very start of the confer-

ence when Dr. Samuel B. -

Gould, chancellor at the State
University of New York,
warned in his keynote ad-
dress that the “power of stu-
dent activism cannot be mini-
mized nor can its potential
Tor creating and maintaining
unrest be taken lightly."

The students on the ACE
program responded with calls

foe more sludent power and
student rights. There were
frequent student criticisms
of the present leadership in
today's colleges and univer:
sities.

Former University of
Michigan 'atudent body presi-
dent Edward N. Robinson
assailed the administrators
for thelr views on student
participation, Administrators
“don't see the problems of
student involvement beyond
how many students should
be on a certain committee,”
Robinson said, while the im-
portant decisions are general-
ly made “by a small group of
presidents and vice presi-
dents behind closed doors."

"Tf think the mroatest value
that came out of the mesting
wad that the trustees con-
fronted students,” said Lune.
"! discovered that the trus
tees’ Iden of what Davidson
should be and the students”
iden of what Davidgzon should
be are cifferent.

Tt think our job was basic
ally w provide them with
information. Some of them
have been away from David
son for several yours, and
they may have forgotten what.
it was iike. Besidus, David-
son has changed a great deal
over the past few yours.”

“My idea of what the trus-
tees were like was complete-
ly changed.’ sald Peklo. °'1
found them to be enthusias-
tic and appreciative. They
‘goomed to respect our ideas.
What we sald carried as
much weight a» the opinions
voiced by the faculty mem
bers who presented the fne-
ulty's viewpoint.”

Mildper said; “T think it
was beneficial to both sides.
The students gained new In-
sights into the functions of
the trustees. and the trustees
found out how we, the -stu-
dents, folt about this particu-
lar issue.”

“T hope the dialogue be-
tween the trustees and the
students will continue,” said
Reed. “The trustees make
decisions that vastly affect
the future of Davidson, and
I feel that we should have 4
voice in those decisions.”
