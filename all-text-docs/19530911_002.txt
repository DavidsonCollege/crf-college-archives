Letter From The Editor

If there will be an abundance of anything available to the
incoming freshman during this period of orientation it will
be free advice.

On the whole most of it will be very good advice. Some
of it you may take and profit by it, a lot you will probably have
to learn by experience, and as the old adage goes, that can
be a very dear school. So it will very likely pay you to absorb
as much as you can during these few days, and save yourself
a great deal of inconvenience later on. You can, of course,
divide it all roughly into two categories: first, how to get
along with your school work, and second, how to get along
outside of the classroom, or the library, or wherever you do
your studying.

It stands to reason that your first concern will be with
your studies and the things that go along with them. That
sounds trite enough, perhaps, and you may have heard words
to that effect many times—undoubtedly you will hear more.
But it stands to reason that unless you do acceptably well,
you won't be around Davidson long enough to worry about
whether or not you make the other “adjustments” to college
life.

This doesn’t mean that you come to college merely to
bury your nose in a book for a period of four years after
which time you emerge from the cocoon with a mind full of
information and a personality full of maladjustments and
short of practical experience that can stand you in good stead
in outside world. It simply means that you’ll be a lot happier
while you’re here if you realize that Davidson is a pretty hard
school by most standards, and that there is no shortcut to
success outside of hard work. Unless a student is unusually
blessed he simply cannot make progress toward his diploma
without some “grind.”

Some of you will want to work harder than others at the
books. That will be pretty much your own business, because
nobody is going to make you do anything. What you get you
pay for, and its a good idea to decide now how much you are
going to pay. Better be willing to pay a good price, because
its very discouraging to find that the price you were offering
was not enough to get you through exams and into second
semester.

Well, after you've taken care of your academic problems
you can think about a lot of other things involved in having
what you will hear called a well-rounded college life. This

includes just about everything from athletics and extracur-].

ricular activities to dating.

You could probably write a few volumes with a lot of
specific advice about how to get along as a freshman at David-
son College, but you might sum most of it up in just a few
words.

The idea is not to try to set the place on fire within the
first few weeks after you get here. If you go out to impress
everybody in a hurry, the chances are the impressions you
make will be bad ones. If you have the goods people will find
out about it in their own good time, no sooner. So above all
things, work hard, or as hard as you feel you should, get to
know people, do things, never forget what you're here for,
and the rest will take care of itself.

Sincerely,
THE EDITOR.

season that starts with the mighty
yellow jackets of Georgia Tech on
September 19.

The standout event of the pre-
season training will occur this Sat-
urday afternoon when the gridders
take on the Mountaineers of Ap-
palachian in a two-hour practice
session. Frosh will be taking tests
and hearing speeches during the
playing time and will thus not
see it. .

In a strong effort to have his
team in top physical condition and
the best running order, offensive-
ly and defensively, Coach Dole has
been running the men at three
practices a day for this entire week.
Now that school will soon be be-
ginning for all students, the regu-
lar schedule of one workput a
day will start next Wednesday.

All-Star Jimmy Thacker will be
leading the pigskin-haulers into At-
lanta’s Grant Field and the game
could well develop into a duel by
another Thacker-size back who is
somewhat better known nationally
—Leon Hardeman.

Other standout backs who prom-
ise to do stellar duty this year
are: quarterbacks Henry Brown
and Johnny Gray, halfbacks Har-
ley Smith and Jim Shelton, and
fullbacks Leroy Fargason and Tal
Broughton. .

In the line, a starting team now
would probably include these
men: center Harry Petersen,
guards Dickie Davis and Bob Pat-
ten, tackles Ben Craig and Neil
Graham, and ends Dan McCall and
Charlie Cousar.

Fall Practice

Arriving on the campus ten days
before even the freshmen began
coming to the Hill for orientation,
the Wildcats have been hard at
work under the skillful eyes of

THE SCHEDULE

i

Pattersen Hurt

Most strongly felt loss to injuries
is that of starting right end Jim
Patterson who sprained his ankle
in the Wednesday afternoon prac-
tice of this week. Jim will miss the
Saturday scrimmage with Ap-
palachian but is due to be ready
for the Atlanta trip next weekend.

Another slightly out of place in-
jury was Harry Petersen’s cauli-
flower ear, usually more common
to boxing than football.

Also on the injured list this
week is Bob Patten who badly
sprained his elbow in practice
Wednesday, but he expects to be
well enough to be hitting again
by next week.

Captained this year by two
starting tackles, Ben Craig and
Neil Graham, the Wildcats will for
the first time in the last two sea-
sons be deprived of the use of
freshmen on the varsity, as the
Southern Conference rule which
allowed them to enter varisty par-
ticipation expired this year.

Freshman Practice

The Athletic Department will be
on the orientation program for
Monday night and Coach Dole said
that he would announce then
when freshman football practice
will begin. This year’s Wild Kit-
tens will play several home and
several games away. Coaching will
be done by the football staff.

In addition to losing the fresh-
men to varsity competition, play
this year will be characterized by
the loss of the two-platoon system
as it had been played for the past
two years. Davidson never was en-
tirely successful in fielding two
entire offensive and defensive
clubs, so the changed style will not
affect the team so much as it will
some other clubs.

The draft breathed heavily on
the neck of dame fortune for the
football squad this summer when
two of its outstanding backs were

Introducing Your Davidsonian

The Orientation weekend is a period in which everyone
who knows anything about Davidson tries to let the freshmen
know it too. Lectures, bull sessions, or leisurely gabs over
cups of coffee add up and up in the frosh mind till he be-
comes a veritable well of jumbled information.

We felt it very proper, therefore, to acquaint you with
your campus newspaper by eulogizing it in good black print,
so that when this Orientation period is gone, you can still read
and get oriented to the Davidsonian and its purposes.

The Davidsonian is a weekly newspaper which usually
runs four pages. It is due in your room shortly after supper
on Friday—except on dance weekends when you'll be lucky
to see it, and it you.

The paper aims at keeping every student posted on every-
thing going on in the college. It is, through letters to the edi-
tor and editorials themselves, a voice for opinions. It, never-
