CHI RHO GOES IT ALONE

A capella singing group entertains students

By Jay Hupson

Last Thursday evening Chi-
Rho, amale acapella singing group,
performed in the Morrison Room
of the college union. The group,
named after the greek letters chi
and rho, is a Christian singing group
hailing from Wake Forest Univer-
sity. The concert was fairly short,
lasting only about forty-five min-
utes, but their melodious voices
and great musical ability left the
audience awestruck and longing
for more. The twelve member
choir consists mainly of non-mu-
sic majors; only one of the twelve
men was a music minor. Chi-Rho
performed a diverse repertoire,
consisting of spirituals, doo-wap,
and pop tunes. Besides singing,
the group entertained the audience
by creating chickens out of

Daytona Beach, Fl, March 7.
Two Davidson students
were listed in stable condition

dishrags and a variety of musical
jokes and vocal outbursts.

Usually anacapellachoircon-
sists of basses, baritones, tenors,
and sometimes countertenors.
Countertenors are the highest male
singing part and are the equivalent
of males singing an alto or soprano
vocal part. Ghi-Rho consisted only
of basses, baritones and tenors.
The most important parts to any
piece are usually the highest parts.
In this case they were tenor part
and the bass part. The tenors usu-
ally provide the melody, and the
basses provide the foundation for
the chords. A capella choirs are
also usually very improvisational.
Even though each vocal part is set,
the performer is at liberty to elabo-
rate upon his part and slightly alter
the vocal line.

At the beginning of the im-
promptu concert the twelve men

ran into the room and broke into
song. The first selection was remi-
niscent of doo-wap tunes and scat
singing. Scat singing is when the
soloist sings in an improvisational
style, creating a melody out of
seemingly random syllables. Scat
singing is used fairly frequently by
jazz singers. Throughout the tune,
the soloist sang in this scat style
with interspersed words and
phrases while the rest of the group
formed the underlying harmony
and chords.

The group also sang several
spiritual selections. The spirituals
that they performed relied com-
pletely upon the soloist to provide
the melodic line, and the backup
parts provided the chord progres-
sion.

The spirituals that they per-

. formed were particularly somber,

and emotional. Chi-Rho’s beauti-

ful singing allowed the audience to
feel the power and true beauty of
these tunes.

The performers also sang sev-
eral pop tunes, including “Longest
Time” and “The Lion Sleeps To-
night.” Before they sang “Longest
Time” they dedicated it to all of the
women in the audience.

Even though their jokes and
attempts at humor were rather con-
trived, the group performed mag-
nificently and were extremely im-
pressive.

Throughout the entire concert
the members of the choir blended
together beautifully. The balance
in the group was incredible; no
one part predominated i in any of
their songs.

The acoustics of the room were
not conducive to singing, but the-
ensemble overcame that with their
beautiful voices.

capable of a wide range of styles.”
A glance at the program confirms
this, listing music by Seal, Tori
Amos, John Philip Sousa, and
Mozart. Dance Troupe shows also
tend to incorporate plenty of ele-
ments other than dance. In “Be-
yond Facades,” Ronnie Klein,
Brian Luskey, and Hayes Trotter
punctuated the dance scenes with
choreographed juggling acts, and
Jennifer Hankins delivered a dra-
matic reading of the lyrics to Tori
Amos’s “Professional Widow.”
Other shows have included such
diverse elements as poetry read-
ings, Classical music, and dramatic
monologues. The group has also
experimented with longer pieces;
earlier this year, in a departure
from their usual dance pieces, the
group produced “Peter and the
Wolf,” choreographed by Troupe
member Carrie Harris. The pro-
ceeds from this show supported
the community service projects of

the Ada Jenkins Center,
