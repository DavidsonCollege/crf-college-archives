LIEUTENANT BOB AKAM, B.S. IN AVIATION ADMINISTRATION

“If | had it to do over again,
would | take Army R.0.1.6.?

Look at it this way. 1 like the idea of doing challenging:
work. That’s why I volunteered for Special Forces. Sc
you can see why I felt pretty good when the Army assigned
me to Europe! Here I really feel I’m doing something for
the cause of my country in these important times. How
many jobs can you think of that start you off with this
kind of responsibility ? My wife’s here, too, and she loves
it. We get a chance to travel. We meet the people, learn
new languages, customs. And there’s a pretty activc
social life on post, too. But above all, I’m an officer with
a job to do and with responsibilities to shoulder. I like
it:that way, and I have a hunch that my leadership train-
ing and experience will help me out whatever I do. Take
it from me, if you’re already half-way towards your
commission, see it through. It’s a good deal. I know.”

Have you ever considered all that is contained within a tiny
seed? Let us suppose you are an engineer. You have been given
the task of designing en acorn. You are given a set of specifica-
tions from which to work. You must design something no larger
than the end of your finger which, under the proper conditions
of temperature and moisture, will begin to absorb certain
minerals from the soil. It must be able to change these minerals
chemically into different substances to form millions of micro-
scopic cells and capillaries. It must send roots deep into the

- earth for support and the absorption of more water and minerals.
. At the same time it must be capable of pushing a trunk upward
- through the soil from any position. If must have a master plan
- which will be able to guide the construction of light sensitive

\

leaves of a definite shape, texture, size, and hve on branches
which shall form at designated places, angles, and intervals on the

trunk. As a further chailenge, you must include in this master

blueprint a means for the completed structure to préduce many
more such acorns. The, wonders of disease resistance and winter
dormancy are just a few more of the millions of miracles packed
within a tiny seed. Yes, only God can make a tree.

favoriate place,

on the spacious front seat of Mark’s father’s

They were parked at their

a road overlooking the country club golf

course and used only by maintenance vehicles.

Mark lazily gazed into the sky.
There was no moon and the
night air was erystal clear. Mil-
lions of stars blinked in bril-
liant flashes of light against
the inky blackness of the sky.
Only the soft music of the ra-
dio broke the heavy silence.
Never had he been s0 blissfully
happy. Everything was 60 per-
fect he wished he could stay
there the rest of his life.

Then the music was interrupt-
ed. “Attention, news bulletin,”
the radio barked. Mark scarcely
noticed any change. It seemed
no different from the adver-
tisements which periodically
pleaded for attention.

The ammouncement continued,
“A convict has just escaped
from the Bellville Penitentiary.
Reports indicate ¢hat he may
have headed this way. A search
has been organized in an all-out
attempt to apprehend him. He
was serving a life term for rape
and first degree murder. He is
thirty six years of sge, white,
about six feet tall, and of med-
ium build.

“He ts easily recognized by
the iron hook whieh has re-
placed his left hand since he
lost it seventeen years ago in
a hunting accident. He is con-
sidered dangerous. We urge
that all residents in this
broadcast area exercise ex-
treme caution until further re-
ports tell of his capture.”

Mark felt Sandra stiffen
slightly in his arms. “What's the
matter?” he asked.

“Didn't you hear that bulle-
tin?” she whispered quickly.

“Naw, what about it?”

“A convict has escaped from
Bellville Penitentiary. That's
only fifteen miles from here
and he’s headed this way. Mark.
1 don’t like it.”

“Aw, don’t sweat it. Radio
stations just like to build things
up for the public.” he assured
her with an.air of. masculine su-
periority. .

Sandra. was easily convinced,
since this was exactly what she
wanted to believe. Securely in
his arms once more, she. soon
left the cares of the world far
behind.

“Attention please.” the radio
sharply interrupted again. “The
convict who escaped from Bell-
ville Penitentiary earlier this
evening has been spotted within

Spring Day

Till is like the spring-well
Flowing strong and up in
Sun-sparkled flecks and
Dancing down and up

And under

Her arms are cool and soft
Tipped with Kitten-fingers slow
Pink-red in the afternoon and

.) Dancing down and up

And under—

In the dark her tongue-whisper
Brushes fire against fire in
Cat-quick encounters and
Dancing down and up

And under—

two miles of this station in the
Rockmont area. We again urge
you to use every precaution.”

“Mark?!” she blurted excited-
ly, “that’s almost in this very
area! Oh please, let's leave.”

Mark had heard the en
nouncement this time. He
wished he hadn't. He hed
that feeling you get when the
telephone rings in the middie
of the prayer during e family
devotional. “The chances ere
a@ thousend fo one thet he
won’t come anywhere near
us,” he snapped. “Do you care
no more about me than to let
any Ittle thing distract you?”

“Any little thing? I suppose
a dangerous, escaped convict
here in this area is just an
irritating trifle? I can tell you're
really concerned about my safe-
ty. Lf you don’t take me home
right now, yow'll just have to
start looking elsewhere in your
little black bool.”

Mark was furious, not neces-
sarily at Sandra but at every-
thing in general. He couldn't
believe that one moment every-
thing could be so wonderful, and
be shattered the next. What had
seemed like vast heavens, set
with twinkling stars just min-
utes before, had closed in until
he now felt as though he were
confined to a black bag with
light sneaking in through pin

holes. As for the radio, he want-}?
ed to rip the wires out. That was |:

what had started it all in the
first place. ‘All right,” he
shouted, “if that’s the way you
want it.”

_ Mark crammed the key in
the ignition and wrenched it
to the right. The new 370-
horsepower engine roared into
life. He threw the gear shift
lever into fow and savagely
floored the accelerator. The
tires screamed inte the night
as the convertible surged for-
ward with a jolt that sent
them both deep into their
seats.

They rode home in silence,

childishly sulking. Mark pulled]

up to her house and stopped

with a jerk. He flung the door|-
open and bounded out. Slam-|’

ming the door with a resounding
clunk, he walked to the other
side of the car to let her out. a
long-established habit of cour-
‘tesy.

As he rounded the long. sleck
tail fin, he stopped short, draw-
ing a quick little breath. He
stood rooted to the spot and
broke out in a cold sweat.

The sight before him made
him feel a dizzy sickness. An

FRIDAY, APRIL 19, 1963

The Beachcomber

Sloping dunes and children’s castles.
Reeds are waving golden tassles.

Shining edges, waves caressing.
Whitecaps dance with Luna's blessing.

Sands that shine with breakers passing,
Waves that rise with Neptune's casting.

Conchshells lie in solemn silence,
Sandcrabs run with awkward violence.

Shadows gray of palmtrees waving
Salty sprays their leaves are bathing.

Whispering breezes touch the ocean.
Silver grasses sway with motion.

Pairs of feet the sand disturbing.

Lines of froth are gently curving.

Stopping here to wet my feet,
Finding there a sandy seat.

Wiggling toes in cool delight,
Settling back to watch the sight.

Moon and waves are playing, dancing,
Like a stallion proudly prancing.

Soon the moonbeams softly failing,
Run from skies the sun is paling.

Now the cooling sands are warming,
Rising sun in fullness forming.

The moon again will come so soon,
And then’s the time I walk the dune.

There's more than fabric superiority in Gant. In addi-

tion, ‘‘needled-into the ways and woof of every Gant
shirt’ — there's flair-fit-show — three vital inher-
ents that make all the difference when a man wears

a Gant.

We chose Gant because they take shirt making seri-

ously. They’re hard to please (like we are) when it

: | comes to fit of collar, its roll, its profile—how much

it shows above the suit collar. They're fastidious
about the way the body of the shirt drapes and folds.
All must integrate to achieve that viable ingredient
which gives comfort and aplomb. In substance, Gant
shirts are keyed to the discerning tastes of well
groomed men who appreciate quality. These men are

our customers.
