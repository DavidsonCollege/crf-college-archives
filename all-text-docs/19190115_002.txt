After a full month's holiday it is ne
easy matter to settle down again to
work, especially as the experiences and
conditions of the last year are to be re-
placed by the old) normal college life.
Adjustment to the present conditions to
some extent will of necessity be gradual.
It will take some time for all the college
organizations to pick up and: get into
good running order once more.

But from appearances the outlook for
the spring of 1919 is most promising.
With a student body by twenty per cent
larger than the most optimistic estimates
of last fall, the college already shows
signs of growing by leaps and bounds.
And these are just the first compliments
War has paid Education, The excellent
spirit of the student body has already
been commented upon: full of life and
pep, yet with a steadiness that promises
a splendid term both in and out of class.

With everything making a fresh start,
Pep should be the motto or resolution of
everyone. No activity will suffer from
snap and drive. ‘The Literary Societies
will need it, and, from remarks of so-
ciety men, will get it. Athletics already
have it. Publications need it and will
try their best to get it. Let's put life
into the old campus and make things
hum this spring. ‘The war has given
everything a shaking up, has sifted out
many of the old worthless habits, and
thrawn in some good ones. It's up to

the men taken up the good habits and
keep out the bad-ones.

The Y. M. C, A, will probably have
most influence in keeping up life on the
campus. Fellows will spend many a
mean, dreary evening down at the gym
enjoving the free Y movies and making
use of the other Y equipment. For this
reason it's up to everyone to give the Y.
M. C. A. his heartiest support and help
in every way possible. Boost it and work
for it.

The worst part of a Christmas holi-
day is that it has to come to an end some
time.

Who would ever have thot to sec
Marguerite Clark down in the gym.

Amo has an unenviable job as editor
of the Annual, but we are confident that
he will put out a volume that will do
credit to the Senior class. ‘

The DAVIDSONIAN, January 15, 1919

In modern ‘times—workmen drive a] NEW IDEA IN MISSION

to their work: reroofing Shear-
er Hall.

‘The weather has done itself proud
lately. But we can hardly hope to es-
cape the proverbial ‘“‘rain eight days a
week.”

“Enza” hasn't quite fown all the way
out again,

It's rather a relief to hear ‘student
body” again instead of “battalion.”

DOUGHERTY-PAINE.

The home of Mr. and Mrs. EF. 5.
Paine, in Tampa, Fhi, was the scene of
a quiet but beautiful wedding last week
when their only daughter, Miss Edna
Lee Paine, became the bride of Mr.
Lewis B. Dougherty, ex-'19, of Liberty.
Mo,

The marriage of Miss Paine and Mr.
Dougherty, while a surprise to many, is
the culmination of a romance begun
three years ago when Miss Paine visited
her brother, Walter H. Paine, at Da-
vidson College.

The wedding guests included only the
inttimate friends of the bride and bride-
groom. tn the living ream where the
ceremony was performed, the decorations
were graceful sprays of asparagus ferns,
bamboo vine, ahd potted palms. “Che
lights were softly shaded. ‘The folding
glass doors were covered with — fern,
forming a dainty and beautiful back-
ground for the wedding party. Mrs.
Paine entered with Lieut. James J.
Love, of Quincy, a classmate of — the
bridegroom = at = Davidson; Walter H.
Paine, ex-"15, brother of the bride, was
hest man. “The ceremony was performed
by Rev. J. C. Tims, of the First Presby-
terian Church.

1... B. Dougherty served six months in
France with a French ambulance unit
before this country entered the war, re-
turning to the United States in 1918 to
train as an aviator with the American
army. He was still in training when the
armistice was signed, and is now released
from. service.

Mr. and Mrs. Dougherty left on the
18:30 train for Liberty, Mo., where
they will make their future home.

At a meeting of the Student Body
Monday, January 13, the following of-
ficers were clected to fill the vacancies
left by men not returning to college:
J. H. Miller, President Student Body:
L. Lo McAlister and A. D. McArn,
Vice-presidents; A. L. Currie, Secretary
and ‘Treasurer.

The Senior class postponed any clec-
tion of officers until a later date.

The Sophomore class reinstated the
officers elected last spring.

The Freshman class elected as Presi-
dent. J. P. Price: for Vice-president.
G. H. Cornelson, Tr.: for Secretary and
Treasurer, J. McD, Richards.

Mr. Miles, the live-wire “Y"  secre-
tary, says that he is planning a checker
tournament for the students, to begin
within the next few days. From the
time the Y. M. C. A. was organized.
one of the chief enjoyments of the hut
has been checker playing, and this tourn-
ament will be very exciting, for bv this
time there must be quite a few checker
sharks on the campus.

Another phase of the “Y" program
which has been a source of pleasure to
the fellows is volley ball. This game
heretofore has been played indoors, but
Mr. Miles has decided to construct a
court in the open so that those who de-
sire to play may take the exercise with-
out putting on a gyyr suit. This court
will probably be located near the open
air gymnasium.

STUDY CLASSES

Mr. Miles, our popular Y. M. C. A.
Secretary, has a novel plan for educating
the student body in missions. Instead of
having classes led by individuals, there
will be formed an open forum for the
discussion of a book entitled “The Call
to a World Task.” This discussion
group will meet each Thursday night at
7:15 in the recreation room in the gym.

The book which will guide the study
of missions is a call to men of real Chris-
tian spirit to seize the opportunity pre-
sented by the critical state of affairs thru-
out the world to bring Christ into the
lives of all men. It seeks a mobilization
of Christian activities in every land. Be-
sides this book there will be papers pre-
pared on various phases of the subject.
The whole scheme holds great promise
for a presentation of many vital ideas on
mission study..

Do not make the mistake of not en-
rolling or attending this open court and
expressing your opinions and listening to
others. It will mean a great deal ta vou
in your spiritual, mental and social life.
Also it is urged, that men will not allow
themselves to sleep thru the hour of 10
a.m. on Sunday morning and miss the
Bible classes.

‘These chisses are not conducted with
the intention of making you get up too
early, but of enriching your mind with
views of the life of Christ here among
men. None of us. can profess to know
enough about Him, and it should be
every one’s earnest desire to learn more.
So make up your mind to be present at
all these meetings, including the vesper
service at 6:30 every Sunday evening in
Shearer Hall.

BOARDING HOUSES AND
THEIR MANAGERS

At the beginning of the spring term
all the boarding houses found that no
recruiting would be necessary to be
done, for every place at the table was
filled at the first meal. ‘The only job
that the managers had to do was to see
that all men who applied at their board-
ing houses were given places, and after-
wards to step on their pocket books. It
is needless to say anything of the whole-
someness of the food, for the men all
know that the greatest care is being
taken in the preparation of the food.
The boarding houses and their managers
are as follows: ‘

Brady’s—Cunningham, E.

Shumaker’s—Wilson, T. H.

Barnes'—Calhocn, L. G.

MeNeil’s—Wilson, A. L.

Long’s—Murphy. S. W.

Manning’s—McCloy, S. F.

Henderson'’s—Schenck, L. B.

Everybody knows Mr. Schofield's old’
store on the eorner opposite the White
Drug Company. Juniors and Seniors in
callége now may even remember — the
place as “Skit’s,” for nearly a quarter of
a century the most popular “joint” in
town. Once again this store will be
opened. Again it will bloom with pros-
perity. G. A. Beal, '21, is the enterpris-
ing owner of this new business. And.
judging from his plans, the old store is
due to have a big “comeback.” It opens
today, if all works well. and so there
will be something new in Davidson !—a
place where you can get the very best of
home-made candies and cakes.

With their disregard for the game
laws some “Wattite” drowned T. H.
Spence, ‘20. and “General” Scott, ‘22.
Feeling on the campus runs high and if
the miscreant is caught it may go hard
with him.
