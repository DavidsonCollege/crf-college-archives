Devotional News

Have Dr. Johnson’s Sermons Sunday School at Shearer Chapel

Benefited the Students ?

Dr. Miles Gives Forcible Address
On This Subject

Mr. Miles addressed ‘the meet-
ing of the Y. M. C. A. last Sunday
night. His direct and forceful talk
was provocative of deep thought on
a very timely subject. The attend-
ance was about 300, which is con-
sidered a fair number.

Reading the last few verses of
Luke 6, Mr. Miles called particular

attention to the parable of the:

houses built on the rock, and on the

- sand. Since Dr. Johnson’s meeting,

the thought of this parable had
been often in his mind, and he
showed that it contained an im-
partant lesson for Davidson stu-
dents. We at Davidson have been
either strengthened or weakened by
Dr. Johnson’s meetings. All were
benefited at the time, for it was
helpful to stand and declare our
purpose to reconsecrate our lives;
but for some. this reconsecration
was not genuine. These men are
worse off than they were before.
If though, we go away and do, our
lives are being built on a rock.
Then, this principle was applied to
different aspects of our student
life. Are we building our college
work on a foundation of honest ef-
fort: will it stand after Christmas
or will it be swept away by exams?
Does profanity go as easily as it did
before? Do the pictures in our
rooms stand in the light of our re-
consecration? It is not enough to
hear, we must do, and do not in our
own strength, but with the help of
Christ. Then our lives will be on
the rock, firm and immovable in the
flood.

Bible Classes.

Rumple leads the battalion while’

Georgia brings up the rear. But
some say that they were too sleepy
to come out. Very well, but will
you be too sleepy to get out when
Gabriel sounds off? Let’s not Iet
such things as football bother us in
these things, but go to Bible class
whether or not. For the past Sun-
day the attendance was after this
manner: ;

Flourishing.

Shearer Church is a four-mile
walk from Davidson (and six miles
back, according to those who walk.
it every Sunday). Not that they
mind it, for everyone of the nine ,
men who go from Davidson is in- |

tensely interested in the Sunday
school work at Shearer Church. It!
is undoubtedly the best Sunday

school going, and the best bunch of
fellows teaching it, according to the
statement ‘of the teachers them-
selves.

There is a definitely organized
‘church, with services every other,
Sunday, and Sunday school every |
Sunday. Mr. R. G. Patterson, who
lives in the vicinity of the church,
is the superintendent. A. M. Mit-
chell is leader of the teachers from |
the college, and it is due largely to
his earnest eftorts that the work
there is so prosperous. He also has
charge of a class of young ladies.
J. P. Price leads the singing and
teaches the Men’s Bible class. R.
R. Mcllwaine has been given the
ladies’ class, while FE. B. MeGukin,
B. LB. Britenhirt, and W. F. Beck in-
struct the younger pupils. Several
of the Davidson men stay for the
church services at night, taking
their meals at homes in the com-
-Munity.

, Plans, are under way to change
the evening services into a Chrts-
tian Endeavor society. There is a
system now in use by which cards
are mailed every week to all ab-
sentees, and in the future this will
be extended to any prospective
members whose names may he,

handed in.’ There is at present an,

average attendance of from 65 to!
85 every Sunday. Improvements ;

are constantly being made in the |
different departments of the Sun- ,

day school and Shearer church will
soon be able to compare favorably
with any city organization.

Worldwide Prohibition Boosted by
Dr. E. V. Claypool.

i

| The college received a rare treat i

Thursday. night when Dr. FE. V-

Claypool, of the = Anti-Saleon
League, delivered an address on
Worldwide Prohibition. He said

4

|

that the only way to keep prohibi- |
tion was to extend it, for if the’
brewers became established in oth- :

er countries they might eventually

try to work their way back. For
this reason, the Anti-Saloon League
is sending a number of men to Eu-
rope and South America to help in
the work there.

Au interesting feature was the

method used for working up a
crowd. Tickets were given to cach
grade of the school to be distribut-
ed thru. the town. These tickets
were presented at the door and
counted by grades. The fourth and
‘seventh grades tied and drew for
the prize. At the noon recess Mon-
day, Dr. Richards presented the
beautiful four by seven flag which
Dr. Claypool had offered as a re-
ward. The system worked excel-
lently, developing a great deal of
rivalry among the school children.

Mrs. J. P. Paisley attended the
Angle-Vaughn wedding in Greens-
boro on the 12th and reports that
the Davidson boys present were the
chief ornaments of the occasion.

When an agent signs a contract with the Southern Life and Trust
Company, we don’t pat him on the back, turn him loose and tell him to
“go to it.” We give him a preliminary correspondence course, and then
a course in our Training School at the Home Office, and then keep in
touch with him and help him overcome his weak points and strengthen
his strong points. As a result, our Training School men are making good.
Drop us a line and ask us to give you full particulars.
