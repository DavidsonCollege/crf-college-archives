‘THE _DAVIDSONIAN

(GUEST COLUMNIST—GRAY HUNTER)

Just a few days ago I was kidding Tony about some of the things
he had said in his column, so today (Friday) he asked me to be guest
columnist and write about prospects next football team.
Under the circumstances, I couldn't back down, I must go
ahead and risk ‘getting a taste of my medicine,

How does the pigskin situation at Davidson look for next year?
Frankly I think it is very dark; even darker than in the past two
seasons. Seven lettermen are returning, and only one of these was
a regular last season. There is no need to kid ourselves into believing
that our coaching staff (and an excellent one, too) can perform the
IMPOSSIBLE! Today, football has almost become a SCIENCE,
and it requires more than sheer SPIRIT to win ball games, at least,
against such TEAMS as the 'Cats encounter. SPEED,. WEIGHT,
POWER, AND EXPERIENCE constitute the main part of GRID- .
IRON SUCCESS, and next year we will be sadly lacking in these
QUALITIES. , However, Davidson supporters may rest assured that
coaches McEver, Chapman, and Spearman will get the very best
out of the MATERIAL they have on hand.

BACKFIELD QUESTION
The BACKFIELD for the most part will be composed of GREEN
MATERIAL as BILL BOLIN and ARCHIE STEED, blocking back
and tail back, are the ONLY LETTERMEN returning. BILL and
ARCHIE proved their worth during the past season and are certain
to bear the brunt of the 'Cats’ offensive attack next fall. In the
writer’s opinion GRANVILLE SHARPE of BEESTER FAME, along
with CLAUDE HACKNEY and STAN YODER up from Coach
SHARPE,
who did some neat hip-shifting punting, and passing in B squad
games, will be a DANGEROUS contender for the tail back post;
while HACKNEY, who’s scintillating runs and consistent defensive
plays for the yearlings marked him as a CAPABLE wingback. In
YODER the Davidson Coaches have WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN
LACKING since the days of ED ARMFIELD—a BIG, BRUISING,
(I ought to know) SIXTY-MINUTE FULLBACK. DAVE SPEN-
CER, star tail back for the frosh, also must not be overlooked.
HE is a good QUICK-KICKER and a fine broken field RUNNER.
NEED OF PASSER
The way it looks now, what the backfield will be suffering from
most, OUTSIDE OF EXPERIENCE, is the LACK of a GOOD PASSER
to fill the shoes of the departing BILL DAVIS. This is a grave situa-
tion too, for with a team as LIGHT as our WILL BE, A GOOD PASS-
ING ATTACK IS ESSENTIAL.

strong bids for positions are: JAY

STRANDWITZ, SPRUNT, and VAUGHAN, in
BACK 'CATS

The statements made above are merely my opinions based on what
I have observed from day to day in practice sessions and actual
games, so don’t take me too seriously. Then, too, spring and early
practice always bring to the front some UNHERALDED CON-
TENDERS.

In spite of the rather OMINOUS OUTLOOK, let’s stay behind
the ’Cats and pray for some of that “GOOD FORTUNE” Wallace
Wade Wit%e of at the D Club banquet.

P. S.—I also PREDICT that JOE McLESKEY, DICK WINTERS,
and YOURS TRULY will hold down positions on the 1939 B team!

EDITOR’S NOTE: Although Gray, better known “Black Dog,”
didn't himself likely prospect for next year’s varsity
‘team, something should be said of this SCRAPPY, LITTLE,
for UNKNOWN REASONS spent the past year on
EFFICIENT and WISE field gen-
eral, he excells on waltzing through a broken field like a scared rabbit.
GRAY mentioned something about the LACK of a GOOD PASSER for
the '39 varsity but certainly he, after proving his worth in this depart-
ment in B will fill the slot CAPABLY. But anyway,
if there is ONLY one man out there scrapping, hustling, and keeping up
that old fight next year, you can rest assured that it will be “BLACK

DOG.”

Three of Davidson's football stal-

cognition on several All-State, All-

ous papers.
Most widely recognized is Bill
Johnston, sturdy lineman, and Ned
Iverson, end. Also mentioned sev-
eral times is Bill Davis, triple-threat
tail-back and safety man.

Johnston has been picked as both
guard and tackle position as he has
played both positions this season.
Selected as honorable mention All-
American on the Associated Press
team and as first and second string
guard several All-Conference
and State teams, Johnston has been
a consistent performer all season.
Particularly adept at smashing thru’
enemy lines and snagging backs be-
fore they got under way, Bill was
also a terror on offense and was us-
ed constantly to open holes in op-
posing lines through which David-
“scat” backs scampered.

Iverson, finished his third year
of varsity ball this season as a
flankman, Six feet four tall and

with plenty of weight to back it
up, he was used especially as a
target for the passes of Davis and
Steed and the 'Cats gained much
ground through his snagging abil-
ity.

Bill Davis has been the
used back in the Davidson lineup.
Running at the tailback slot he
handled much of the running, most
of the passing and kicking. In the
last department he stood out parti-
cularly well having an average of 40
yards per kick for the season, Be-
sides handling the various offensive
duties Davis also played the watch-
dog or safety position when on the
defense.

These men are all seniors and
played their last ball for the ’Cats

Rival coaches “Black Dog”
Hunter and Bob McClellan of
Watts and Georgia, respectively,
announced to their squads Mon-
day that the annual Watts-Geor-
gia football game had been call-
ed off because it would be impos-
sible to secure equipment to out-
fit the two teams and also because
the varsity playing field was not
available. Watts—undefeated in
this classic since 1838 (no score
available for 1837)—had ruled as
odds on favorites over Georgia.

ROADWAY &

Frosh Cagers
Play On Dec.9

After a week of intensive practice
the frosh cage squad is rapidly
rounding into shape for their open-
ing game here on December 9.

The squad of forty boys who orig-
inally reported to practice was cut
last week, to twenty, all of whom
received equipment. Although the
squad has been rather slow to round
into shape it appears that it will be
above the usual freshman team.

Some of the players are looking
good so far in the elementary
drills and workouts that have been
held. On Monday the first scrim-
mage was held with Don Bell, Ed
Lucas, Jack Simonds, Marvin Sink,
and Dave Spencer holding down
posts on a tentative first string.

These five are getting much com-
petition, for their places however
from Bobby Carter, John Strand-
witz, Bob McLeod, and several oth-
ers.

Jones Game Thurs. and
Southern Conference

Davidson's varsity basketball team
opened their 1938-'39 season against
the Mill Power Supply Co., team
by giving them a 67-33 beating in
the Davidson gym as Coach Shep-
ard used every man in uniform,

Although the ’Cats looked ragged
at times, as a whole their offense
clicked well while they kept their
weaker opponents well bottled up
under the baskets,.Leading by 33-
12 at the half the ’Cats used all their
men while running up a large final
score.

Ned Iverson, captain and forward,
led the Davidson scoring with 14
points. “Footsie” Cowan and Jim
Hogg tied for second high with
eleven points each. Levi of the Milt
Power team led their scoring with
15 points to top Iverson’s number.

Both teams committed numerous
fouls, Davidson making 19 while the
Charlotte team made 10. The ’Cats
served notice that they are out for
all points available as they complet-
ed seven of the ten free shots they
were allowed.

Davidson’s next game is with the
J. O. Jones team from Charlotte on
Thursday, which gives them two
days of preparation. Soon after this
game the regular scheduled South-
ern Conference games will start.

Starting lineups* were as follows:
Iverson—(14)__ R.F. ---Quick—( 4)
Harrison—(4)_ L.F, -----Levi—(15)
Cowan—(11)_. C. Armstrong—( 4)
