THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 13, 1932

Survey Reveals That 40.6 Per Cent of

——

Classes Graduating Since 1925 Have
Continued Studies After Leaving Here

Of the Total 736 Graduates, 102 Have
Prepared Themselves for the Min-
istry and 197 Have Done other
Graduate Study

PEAK IN 1928

These 299 Men Have Enrolled at 52
Different Institutions Throughout
America. Many to North

The alumni office has completed a survey of
the last’ seven graduating classes at Davidson,
to ascertain how many have attended graduate
institutions, including seminaries, and the alumni
secretary has prepared statistics that are re-
vealing to the general public and flattering to
the institution.

Briefly and summarily, it is learned that of
the 736 graduates of the last seven classes, 299
of them, or 40.6 per cent, have continued their
studies after leaving Davidson. Of the total 299,
almost one-third of them, 197 for a percentage
of 26.7 to be exact, have entered institutions
other than seminaries, and 102 of them, or 13.8
per cent, have prepared, or are preparing, them-
selves for the ministry. These men have attend-
ed 52 different institutions.

At the outset it may be explained that this
percentage might be even larger if each indi-
vidual had been asked to fill out a blank indi-
cating the data that has been prepared. It is
based largely, however, on the knowledge of the
last seven classes that has seeped into the office
of the alumni secretary, and it is believed: that
a number of others have done part-time gradu-
ate work since leaving Davidson.

It is readily recognized from the chart which
has been prepared and which is printed at the
end of this article that there was a notable in-
crease in interest in post-graduate study from
1925 through 1928. The peak was reached in
the latter year, when 51.6 per cent of the ’28
graduates continued their preparation at other
institutions. Since then, however, there has
been a drop, and an explanation which seems
plausible is the financial depression which swept
the country in the fall of 1929, and curtailed it
perceptibly. It is a well known fact that study-
ing in graduate universities entails an expendi-
ture almost double that of Davidson.

On Decrease

Between 1928 and 1929, the decrease was 7.1
per cent, and the difference between 1928 and

1930 was 12.8 per cent. Figures listed for the
class of 1931 should not be taken as final, for
a number of the most recent graduates are now
working and expect later to enter the profes-
sional institutions. This will hold true to a
minor extent for the class of 1930, but the
final percentage would not vary much from
that which is given.

With the exception of the year 1928, when
only eight per cent of the class decided to enter
the ministry, there has not been much variance
in the number of men or the percentage of the
class going to the seminary. Eliminating the
1928 record, the percentage has varied but 5.9,
the class of 1927 having the highest, 18.6 per
cent of its number entering that work, to the
low of the class of 1931 with 12.7. Again, there
may be more 1931 men enter the ministry, but
it will be noted that 1929 had 12.8, which does
not change the original margin much.

It.is doubtful if there will be any class which
will soon equal the record of 1928 in the num-
ber of men who went to professional schools,
other than the seminaries. The total was 43.2

per cent of the class, or “54 of the men. Low |
percentage is held by 1931 with 17.3, but there
will .be others later. The next percentage is
that of the class of 1925 with 19 per cent of
its members.

No attempt has been made to prepare sta-
tistics upon the various seminaries which the
102 men attended, except to state that they
have gone to eight different institutions, as
follows: Union Seminary, Richmond, Va.; Co-
lumbia Seminary, Decatur, Ga.; Louisville
Seminary, Louisville, Ky.; Princeton Seminary,
Princeton, N. J.; Westminster Seminary, Phila-
delphia, Pa.; San Francisco Seminary, San
Anselmo, Calif.; Erskine Seminary, Due West,
S. C., and the Baptist Seminary, Seminary Hill,
Texas,

Where They Studied

On the other hand, it is interesting to study
where the 197 graduate students have attended.
The total is 44 different colleges or universi-
ties. It may be explained here that a number
of the 197 men have attended more than one
institution since they left Davidson, and with
this in mind the statistics offered will be more
understandable.

The largest number of Davidson graduates in
the last seven years have attended the Univer-
sity of North Carolina in its various depart-
ments. Almost one-fourth have gone to Caro-
lina. There have been 48 Davidson graduates
there for a 24.4 percentage. What is most inter-
esting is that Harvard University claims the
next largest number with 35, or a percentage
of 17.7, while the next closest institution is the
University of Virginia with 16, followed by
Duke University with 15.

Looking at it from another angle, the gradu-
ate departments of Carolina, Duke, N. C. State
and Wake Forest have claimed 34 per cent, or
67 of the total 197 post-graduate students, while
the five institutions of Harvard, Columbia Uni-
versity, University of Pennsylvania, Yale and
Princeton have together claimed 69 of them for
a 35 per cent record. With these institutions
obtaining 69 per cent, it is readily seen that the
others are over a large number of institutions.

The following are institutions, and the num-
ber of Davidson men who have attended them
in the past seven years:

University of North Carolina, 48; Harvard,
35; University of Virginia, 16; Duke Univer-
sity, 15; Columbia University, 11; University
of Pennsylvania, 11; Emory University, 10;
Vanderbilt, Yale and Princeton, and Richmond
Medical College, six each; Tulane and Univer-
sity of Edinburgh, five each; Cornell and Uni-
versity of Georgia, four each; University of
Chicago, New York University, Johns Hopkins
and N. C. State, three each.

Institutions which two Davidson men attend-
ed have been Jefferson Medical College, Uni-
versity of Maryland, University of South Caro-
lina, and the University of Arkansas. The
others, at which one Davidson graduate was a
student are University of Texas, Temple Uni-
versity, University of Michigan, Colorado
School of Mines, Purdue, George Washington
University, Massachusetts Institute of Technol-
ogy, University of Colorado, University of Mis-
sissippi, University of Alabama, Carnegie Tech,
Charleston Medical Coilege, University of
Miami, University of West Virginia, Brown,
University of Louisville, Wake Forest, Univer-
sity of Illinois, Oxford University and Univer-
sity of Vienna.

The following chart will give data regarding
the distribution of the men to the seminaries
and graduate schools according to the classes:
