OPINIONS

MONDAY, OCTOBER 7, 1996

Kristen Richardson

A kiss on the hand would be quite continental ...

It is not everyday that I am
utterly violated by my mail. Of
course, there is the aggravation of
receiving stupid mail that you will
never read or catalogues whence
come no products that you will
ever purchase. An example of this
which comes to mind is the weekly
Gardener's Eden catalogue. How
did they know of my penchant for
topiary and endless free time? Oh
well, after almost four years of the
same mailbox, I am on every mail-
ing list I could imagine and some
you could not.

So brings me to the offending
mail: Victoria’s Secret. Usually, I
object to this catalogue on the
grounds that their lingerie is manu-
factured with cheap fabrics, and
therefore falls apart, and that it
comes in colors like aqua and lav-
ender. Nonetheless, every woman
seems to get this catalogue. Many

order from it. I don’t.

Before talking about the spe-
cific infraction which provided the
impetus for this article, let me pro-
vide some (contextual)

crusted brassiere glittered across
the cover of the catalogue I just
received. That is correct. A dia-
mond bra. For those of you who

your breasts up so high that you
nearly choke. Not to mention that
the level of padding befits football,
not l'amour.So what we have re-

ally is a pair of dia-

support. This year
Victoria’s Secret has
decided on anew~snar-
keting scheme. They
have decided to offer a
series of “fantasy gifts”
to their customers. One
is a house in England,
one is a trip to Monaco
and one is a create-
your-own-perfume

If someone gave
me a diamond bra,
I would beat him
senseless with it.

mond football pads.
There are so many
ways in which this
bra is ridiculous that I
won’t go into all of
them. I don’t think
that this thing is even
worthy of feminist or
cultural analysis, so
let’s take a voyage
into the mind of the

extravaganza in
Provence. Okay, I admit that the
house sounds good to me, but I
still wouldn't order it from a cata-
logue.

The most inane of all the gifts
is a bra. Ah, but no ordinary bra is
this. A $1,000,000 diamond-en-

have not had the transcendent ex-
perience of a bejewelled undergar-
ment, I highly recommend perus-
ing the Victoria’s Secret catalogue.
I forgot to mention that this is also
a miracle bra. A miracle bra is the
same as a wonderbra. They push

potential buyer. I

‘would say that the target customer

is a middle-aged man, newly and
conspicously wealthy, with nym-
phomaniacal— possibly megaloma-
niacal—tendencies. He has a young
mistress and a very healthy bank
account. He purchases in a flurry

of stereotypically fin-de-siécle
decadence and sexual angst.

I know that the buyer is not a
woman. How am I so sure? How
many women want visibly hard
objects to protrude from their
chests? If someone gave me a
diamond bra, I would beat him
senseless with it. Not to mention
what would happenif you lost it or
had to clean it. I can’t imagine
you could run it through the gentle
cycle or take it to the dry cleaners.
Swishing itin jewellry cleaner isn't
really practical either. I guess you
could put it on exhibit. If you can’t
afford the bra, don’t be sad. It is not
even pretty. Trust Victoria’s Se-
cret to make a bra for one million
dollars and have the damn thing
still be ugly. If you do like the look,

. Jam sure youcan achieve the same

results with a bra from Target and
a Bedazzler™,

Merriam Webster’s New Col-
legiate Dictionary defines the verb
“to haze,” present participle “‘haz-
ing,” as the following: “to harass
by exacting unnecessary or dis-
agreeable work,” or “to harass by
banter, ridicule, or criticism.” The
Laws of North Carolina define the
term as “to annoy any student by
playing abusive orridiculous tricks
upon him, to frighten, scold, beat,
or harass him, or to subject him to
personal indignity” (14-35).

Last Monday,

each freshwoman was asked to sign
a Statement of Consent Form ac-
knowledging her full awareness of
the college Hazing Policy and that
she was not to participate in any
activity violating said policy, and
even though each freshwoman fully
understood that the activities were

completely voluntary and would

incur absolutely no consequences
or repercussions should she choose
not to participate, our well-mean-
ing, group unifying project was

don’t hold the same connotation),
but we were told that the grounds
for the administration’s displea-
sure was not the fact that these
women were choosing to partici-
pate, but that their participation
could cause emotional scarring in
later life and thus put the college in
a tight legal situation should such
scarred individual decide that
their life was permanently marred
by a week spent with goggles on
their head and sue for mental an-
guish.

the upperclass
women of the Swim-
ming and Diving
team were accused
of the above defined
transgression by pro-
posing a week of ini-
tiation for the
freshwomen of the
team.

The indicting
act had nothing to do
with alcohol, nor did
it ask the initiaties to

How our initiation |
activity got pigeon-holed
into the same category
as “abusive or ridiculous
tricks,”’... I will never

know.

My pointis this:
sometimes definitions
can be taken too far.
How our initiation ac-
tivity got pigeon-holed
into the same category
as “abusive or ridicu-
lous tricks,” as fright-
ening, scolding, beat-
ing and harassing our
initiaties I will never
know. [understand the
obligation on the part
of our friends the ad-

perform physical la-
bor of any sort; furthermore, the
perilous request evoked neither
ridicule nor criticism of any kind,
nor did it place the freshwomen in
any conceivable situation of the
compromising nature. No, the
Women's Swimming and Diving
Team was accused of hazing their
freshwomen by posing the option
to them to wear their goggles on
their heads around campus.

As silly and ridiculous as it
might sound, and as innocent as we
intended the activity to be, my co-
captain, another team member and
I were told by quite well-meaning
administrators that even though

deemed illegal.

I am not writing this article to
point fingers, extract sympathy, or
vent my anger and frustration with
a system whose priorities are se-
verely out of whack. Instead, I’m
writing to express my grave disap-
pointment in a system that refuses
to differentiate between healthy
situations and harmful ones, and
who punishes those with good in-
tentions for the potential actions of
those with detrimental ones.

Not only were we forced to

-retitle our week of freshwoman

initiation “Fun Women’s Swim
Team Week” (somehow the two

ministrators tolook out

’ for the well-being of each student,

and I, along with my teammates,
appreciate them for pointing out
our grievous mistake.

Furthermore, I would fully
understand the administrative tizzy
regarding our little activity if we
were actually making fun of the
freshwomen, or drawing negative
attention to them, or beating them
with their goggles. But since none
of these situations are the case,
perhaps the administration should
re-evaluate their reactions to inno-
cent, well-intentioned activities
and save their energy for those
actually deserving it.
