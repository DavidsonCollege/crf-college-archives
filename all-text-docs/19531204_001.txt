DAVIDSONIANS ENJOY Paintings By Moose (Mr. Edwin Shewmake|£
LAUGHTON PROGRAM [Exhibited in Lobby {To Give Artist Talk

In the performance of “An Eve-
ning with Charles Laughton,” Da-
vidsonians and many others who
were interested in what the star
himself aptly called a “cultural
binge” enjoyed one of the most
rewarding evenings of the year.

Laughton, the genial, witty, and
thoroughly likeable performer,
provided not a selection of read-
ings but of recitations.

So familiar was he with all the
works from which he gave ex-
cerpts, that the presence of a
printed text served the purpose of
appearance only.

Without any pretense of organ-
ization, he rambled from the sub-
limity of Lincoln’s “Gettysburg
Address” to the hilarity of a fable
in the hep style of James Thurber.

Laughton set the atmosphere for
each of his “readings” not merely
by his preparatory remarks but
more importantly by the assump-
tion on his own part of the atti-
tude which made for greater ap-
preciation of the selection. An ele-
ment that further endeared him
to his audience was his acting out
the parts of the characters whose
lips he assumed.

Among those recitations best
liked by his hearers were the fa-
mous speech of the devil from
“Don Jaun,” extracts from Dicken’s
“Little Dorrit,” and the story of
the fiery furnace from Daniel.
These, like the rest of his selec-
tions, were chosen because of the
importance of their message to
modern society.

After the performance, Laugh-
ton maintained the same jovial hu-
mor that had characterized him
while he was on the stage. As he
chatted backstage with autograph-
seekers and faculty members, he
showed his interest in them by
shaking a multitude of hands and
by seeking information about the

Eu, Phi Societies
Hear Stuart, Wilson

The Eumanean and Philanthropic
Literary Societies held their regu-
larly-scheduled meetings Monday
night, November 30.

Monday night’s meeting of “Phi”
consisted solely of an informative
talk by Professor James Southall
Wilson about Edgar Allan Poe, No
business was discussed, and no
resolutions or appointments were
made,

At the “Eu” meeting there were
several events of interest. First,
Henry Brockmann was appointed
critic and reviewer for the re-
mainder of the semester; then two
resolutions, both being rather light,
‘were made; and, finally, Ed Stuart
presented the program.

Stuart’s speech, the highlight of
the meeting, was entitled “Manure
and Tagore,” and it was based on
problems in India. The speech was
a contrast of the real and the ideal
there, and it brought out the
opinions alive today as to the solu-
tion of the problems.

“Eu’s” next meeting was tenta-
tively set for Monday night, Decem-
ber 14, with the election of second-
semester officers as scheduled

THE LOCAL NEGRO HUT

—_— _————
wv a -

The present exhibition of paint-
ings in the lobby of Chambers con-
sists of a group of twelve paintings
by Philip Moose.

These twelve were shown in
September in a one-man show of
Moose’s work in the Mint Museum
in Charlotte. They represent the
various media in which he has
worked: oil, watercolor-gouache,
and encaustic, the latter a dif-
ficult process employing the use
of pigment fixed with hot wax.

Moose is well known at David-
son College for his work in the
Fine Arts Department during the
past two years. His work has been
seen here in several exhibitions in
Chambers during recent years, and
in an exhibition of drawings and
watercolors in the College Union
last spring.

At present Philip Moose is in
Germany on a Fulbright Scholar-
ship, painting and studying at the
Munich Academy of Art. This is
the second valuable painting
scholarship that he has received for
work abroad; in 1948 he was
awarded the Pulitzer Prize for
Painting and spent a year in Paris
and southern France. He has also
spent considerable time painting
and travelling in Mexico and
Guatemala.

This young painter lives in New-
ton, N.C., about 30 miles from Da-
vidson. He received his formal
training at Columbia University,
The Art Students League in N.Y.,
and Skowhegan School of Painting
and Sculpture in Maine. His work
has been widely exhibited through-
out this state and the South, and
in such important national shows
as the Corcoran Biennual in Wash-
ington and the 1952 exhibition of
American Watercolors, Drawings
and Prints by the Metropolitan

Museum of Art in N. Y.

Mr. Edwin Shewmake, son of Da-
vidson's Dr. Edwin F. Shewmake,
retired professor, will make an in-
formal talk in the ballroom of the
Union on Wednesday, December 9.

Mr. Shewmake will speak about
art, centering his talk around
Chick Young’s comic strip, “Dag-
wood,” and the French artist

| Picasso.

He will endeavor to show how
even a comic strip can reflect the
age in which we live in the same
manner that an artist reflects the
life in his age.

Excavation To Begin

The ROTC building was moved
approximately 60 feet to the east,
and about one fourth of the present
shop building behind Watts and
Georgia Dormitories has been torn
down,

Treasurer D. Grier Martin re-
vealed that excavation for the
foundations of the new building
is expected to start next week.

The beginning of construction

‘Y’ MUSIC DEPT. PLAN
CHRISTMAS VESPERS

Preparations for the annual
Christmas Vespers will swing into
the final stages next week. The
Music Department and the YMCA
have been concentrating their ef-
forts toward making this annual
service as successful as in previous
years. Christmas Vespers will be
held on Sunday night, Dec. 13, at
7:30, in the church.

A committee composed of Pro-
fessor R. W. Tyson, Rev. Sam
Newell, Professor Donald Plott,
Rev. Sam Magill, and Dolph Allen
recently chose from a group of
fifteen applicants the Reader for
the service, Fred Summers. Char-
lie Williams, president of the
YMCA, will preside. Both the Male
Chorus and the Chapel Choir will
sing selections during the service.

The Chamber Orchestra, con-
ducted by Mr. Kenneth Moore,
and the college organist, Mr.
Philip Gehring, will provide in-
strumental music. Dr. Cufhningham
will close the service with the
benediction.

As in past years, the service will
be by candlelight. The reading will
be divided into three parts, the

Prophesy, the Birth, and the
Adoration. There will be a back-
ground of organ music during each
section with three choral pieces
following each. The service will be
basically the same, but the overall
length of it will be somewhat
shortened.

Beginning about 7:00 will be the
antiphonal playing of Christmas
carols by the Davidson College
Brass Ensemble under the direc-
tion of Mr. John Satterfield. The
group will be split into halves,
these answering each other from
separate parts of the campus.

The offering at Christmas Ves-
pers will go toward several commu-
nity and campus projects of the
YMCA and cover increased operat-
ing expenses of this year.

YMCA Secretary Sam Magill is-
sues a cordial invitation to the
families, relatives, and friends of
the students to attend this impres-
sive service. The time suggested
to get good seats is about 6:45,
since seats at Christmas Vespers
are on a_ first-come-first-served

basis.

SIGURD RASCHER
TO APPEAR WITH
D.C. CONCERT BAND

The student body will be offered
an interesting series of musical
programs between now and the
Christmas holidays. The series
opens tonight, featuring the David.
son College Concert Band.

This evening, at 8:15 in Cham-
bers Auditorium, the Davidson Col-
lege Concert Band will make its
initial. performance for this year
on the campus. The Band, called
“One of the really outstanding col-
lege bands in the country” by Ed-
win Goldman, has as its guest
soloist for this evening Sigurd
Rascher.

Mr. Rascher is considered to be
one of the outstanding saxaphonists
in the world today. He has per-
formed with such distinguished
companies as the Boston Sym-
phony, the New York Philharmonic
Orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic
Orchestra of London, and the Ber-
lin Philharmonic Orchestra.

Several composers have dedi-
cated works to Mr. Rascher, two
of which he will play this evening—
“Concerto for Saxophone” by Gla-
zounov and “Introduction and Sam-
ba for Saxophone and Band” by
Whitney.

Mr. Kenneth Moore will conduct
the band in a varied selection of
arrangements, a few of which are
“Death and Transfiguration” by
Richard Strauss, “Farandole” by
Bizet, “Commando March,” -a com-
position written during World War
11 by Barber, and “King Cotton
March” by Sousa. Mr. John Sat-

“y’”? Gift Fund, Town Committee
Begin Local Improvement Project

By AUSTIN STRAND

The local Negro community is
to gain improvement through the
aid of the student body’s Christ-
mas gift fund.

For many years this community
has been more or less of a prob-
lem to Davidson. Several times the
townspeople have gone into the
community in order to aid the peo-
ple in it and thus to better the
town as a whole; each time they
have fallen short of their goal.

Now eight hundred students
from Davidson seeing a need that
they as Christians can help fill,

, |have selected to put their efforts

The recreation hut in the loce! Negro community must soon be
moved, and repairs are badly needed to both outside and inside.
Part of the Christmas Gift Fund will be used to do these jobs. These
high cost assets to the community will be bough? through the
Christmas Gift Fund. The Davidson students and the Davidson
community will work together this year for the much needed local

imprevemente,

into the community in another
trial to help the needy Negro
people of Davidson. That sounds
like a pretty noble deed, and it is,
if the Davidson student body will
fall in behind the Gift Fund and
push it ovér its goal of $5,000 so

that improvements can be made.

One wonders exactly what im-
provements the Y Cabinet had in
mind in suggesting this project as
one to be considered for Gift Fund
money, and it is the purpose of
this article to enumerate the needs
of the community.

The Negroes of this community
do not have a local theatre which
they can attend. In order to go to
the show they must either go to
Charlotte or Mooresville. Mike
York has been showing movies at
the Y hut, located in the commu-
nity, in order to alleviate part of
this need for entertainment, but it
has been impossible for him to
show them consistently, and funds
for renting films have been scarce.

It is hoped that all improvement
can be centered around the Y hut,
but. this hut must be moved to
another Jot, as it is now on school

property. The Y hut has been an
important center of aid to the com-
munity for a long time, so long a
time that it is in need of some
definite improvements, such as re-
pairs to the building proper (in-
cluding painting the ceiling), a
floor furnace (it is now heated by
one pot-bellied stove), a bathroom
(it does not have one now), hot
water, and linoleum flooring.

Not only is it hoped that the
student body will give enough in
order*to make these repairs, but
also it is hoped that enough money
will be given in order to purchase
a TV set to be put in the hut for
the entertainment mainly of the
children, but also of the adults.
This is one way the student body
can help curb delinquency in the
town.

Now tb express one final hope
that is centered around this year’s

Gift Fund—that of money for gen-
eral repairs and bills of the build-
ing in the future. The way this will
be worked is through a fund set
up in some bank, the fund to be
drawn on for repairs of the build-
ing along with any other special
expenses.

The students of Davidson are
not the only ones concerned with
the conditions “across the tracks.”
The people in that community have
selected a committee which has met
with the Gift Fund group of the
Y in an effort to figure out where
the money could be used best.

The Davidson project, then, be-
comes a great opportunity for the
Davidson student body, a basically
Christian student body, to show the
true Christian spirit of Christmas
by helping those who are trying
desperately to help themselves.

Frais Plan Annual
Party For Orphans

The eleven fraternities and the
Campus Club will have their an-
nual Chirstmas party for the chil-
dren of the Presbyterian Orphan's
Home at Barium Springs on Thurs-
day night, December 17.

Approximately one hundred and
thirty boys and girls between the
ages of six and thirteen will be in
the Barium Springs group this
year. They will be brought to the
campus by the orphan’s home bus,
arriving at 7:16 Thursday night.
After a brief period of welcome in
the College Union, they will go
in groups of ten or twelve to the
various fraternity houses for a
period of games and songs and re-
freshments.

The climax of the evening will
be the appearance of Santa Claus
himself, who will be making his
first appearance of the season in
Davidson.

(in a telephone conversation
with Mr, Claus earlier in the
week, he assured this news-
paper that there would be 2
gift for every boy and girl
visiting Davidson that night.—
Ed.)

Although sponsored by the fra-
ternities and Campus Club, mem-
bers of the faculty and adminis-
tration are invited to enjoy and
share in the parties as they have
done in the past.

The plan permits a student to
attend Davidson for three years,
and Columbia's School of Engineer-
ing for the last two years with the
combined course leading to the
appropriate bachelor’s degree from
both institutions.

The student electing to follow
such a combined program obtains
the advantages of a broad general
training in the liberal arts field
at Davidson and a technical educa-
tion at Columbia through five years
of study rather than the longer
period that would usually be re-
quired if both degrees were ob-
tained separately.

The student is guaranteed ac-
ceptance at Columbia provided Da-
vidson recommends him at the end
of his three years here.

During the student's three years
at Davidson, he will follow a pro-
gram consisting of basic humani-
ties and physical science subjects
with only a minimum of pre-pro-
fessional work.

Both Davidson and Columbia will
appoint a liaison officer to facili-
tate the administration of the pro-
gram.

In commenting on the plan, Dr.
Cunningham issued the following
statement: “Davidson College feels
honored by the invitation to join
with another leading educational
institution in the combined plan.

“We feel this is an excellent pro-
gram for those students who desire
a liberal arts education combined
with the engineering training
which they will receive at Colum-
bia.”

By accepting the plan Davidson

be used in the local community.
