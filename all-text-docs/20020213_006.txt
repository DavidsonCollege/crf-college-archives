Inside the Code... Student solicitors and defense advisors

Inform your vote: Important yet often poorly understood Honor Council positions explored

By Emity Drew

Senior Staff Writer

Despite the emphasis Davidson’s Honor
Code receives in the admissions literature,
few students will ever have intimate contact
with an actual Honor Council hearing. As
such, students may find it difficult to cast an
informed vote for student solicitors or de-
fense advisors — two key positions during an
Honor Code trial. :

In this semester’s category II elections, two
new defense advisors and two new student
_ solicitors will be determined. These students
will work with the students and professors
involved in the Honor Council trials. Last
year’s advisors and solicitors will step down
after training their replacements later this
spring. ;

“T really learned a lot about Davidson and

the Honor Code while serving as a defense
advisor,” said Evan Andersen ’02, who hopes
that future advisors aren’t intimidated when
beginning the job.
“The first two times
an elected advisor
or solicitor partici-
pates in a trial, they

and defense advi-

each case. Student solicitors also work with —

the Dean of Students to determine which
cases will actually appear before. the Honor

Council. “Our job is to investigate the case
and to provide the best sanction,” said student
solicitor Andy Wright ’02. “Our goal isn’tto
‘win.’ We just try to uphold the Code.”
“It’s every student’ s duty to respect, under-
stand, and uphold the Honor Code,” said

_ Student solicitor Trevor Stanley ‘02. He

looked around the Union where laptops,
bookbags, and wallets were left unattended
all over the busy café. “You may not talk
about it all the time, but you see it every-
where.”
