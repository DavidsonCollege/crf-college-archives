SOPH SOUTHPAW STEPS INTO VARSITY SLOT

The crack Davidson tennis team

will’ be depending on him for big
things next year.

Although small at 140 pounds,
Allen is sturdy and is always in
good condition. Opponents soon
find out that they can’t wear him
out. He is a good all-around ten-
nis player who prefers to operate
from the back line, although he is
good at the net, His is the game of
smoothness and consistency as op-
posed to the game of continually
rushing the net for a kill. Because
he is fast he returns many shots
which he could not otherwise reach.
Another factor in his favor is
that he doesn’t lose his temper.
but is always trying up until the
final point. ;

Two years ago while still in ‘high
school Strand won the State Junior
Singles title. Last year he was top
man on the undefeated freshman
team and lost only one match. He
has continued his fine brand of
tennis this year, losing only against
the top notch Florida teams.

Council and a member of Phi Del-| number one man next year and

10 walks and 3 hits. Potts of Salis-
bury smashed a triple in the first
inning. Most of the Kittens’ 10
runs were collected in the initial
inning and so Coach Baird sub-
stituted quite freely toward the
last of the game.

The Freshman baseball team,
under the direction of Coach Boyd
Baird, got off to a flying start by
trimming Boyden High School of
Salisbury, 10-2,- last Saturday aft-
ernoon. It was the first game of

son for the Frosh. Paul Eastman,

they colleced only four hits them.

and 6 errors into a 10-run game.
Arnold Whisnant was -the lead-
ing slugger for the victors with a
double in his four trips to the plate.
Homer Cathey, Al Reece, and
Chuck Elliot also hit one safety
each in the game.

Smith hurled 2 5-hit. ball game,
walking only 2 men and striking
out 5. Davidson collected 7 hits
and used 7 walks and 3 errors on
the part of the Central squad to

bat until they got tired and then
condescended to make three outs.
Except for those two innings, the
Cats looked like a real ball club,
and much is still to be hoped for
as the season goes along and the
boys settle down. Torrence looked
a little wobbly on the hill and his
arm seemed to still bother him. At

Jim Smith’ pulled the same trick
