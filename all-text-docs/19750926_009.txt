Dawn

D.C. trees reflect education,

By DAVE KELLER

One of the most attractive
features of the Davidson cam-
pus is its number of large,
stately trees. Growing every-
where on the campus, these
giants greatly enhance the ap-
pearance of the college and
often provide welcomed shade
from the North Carolina sun.
However, their appeal is not
only aesthetic; Davidson trees,
believably enough, have a great
deal of educational value.

According to Dr. Tom
Daggy, head of the Biology
Dept., the Davidson campus
has a number of trees which
are, although not exceedingly
rare, rather unusual. There is
even said to be a tree on
campus which was planted by
Woodrow Wilson.

Two of the least common
Davidson trees are the black
maple and the dawn redwood.
The black maple, which at
Davidson grows near the gym,
is rarely.found growing wild in
North Carolina. Our specimens,
which are still small, were
transplanted from Indiana,
where they are found more
frequently.

The dawn redwood was a
tree which was for years only
known by fossil specimens.
Then, in 1944, a single living
specimen was found growing in
western China; later, the tree
was found growing in abun-
dance in other parts of China
and is now cultivated all over
the world. One particular speci-
men, which grows behind the
Dana Science Building, was
given to the college by a
horticulturist in Charlotte.

There are also several other
asiatic evergreens growing on
campus. In front of the Dana
Building is a Deodar cedar from
the Middle East, which, along
with several ¢edars of Lebanon
uptown, are true members of
the cedar family (it seems that
what Americans normally call
cedars are actually junipers). In

front of the college church and
also near the guest house are
several asiatic evergreens
called cunninghamias. Former
college president John R. Cun-
ningham was often jokingly
chided for planting trees that
bore his name.

Trees most common on cam-
pus are red and silver maples,
ten varieties of oaks, slippery,
winged and American elms (the
latter of which is quite endan-
gered in the U.S. because of
Dutch elm blight), and sweet-

gum, an unusually large spec-
imen of which grows between
Chambers and the Union.

This stately tree presumably
is the same tree planted by
Woodrow Wilson during his
freshman year here. History
professor Chalmers G. David-
son faithfully believes that if
the Wilson tree is still standing,
it is indeed the sweetgum.

“President Wilson definitely
planted a treé on campus; the
problem is where and whether
or not it is still standing,” said

Davidson.

According to Davidson, in
the spring of Wilson’s freshman
year (1874) the college declared

a holiday for the students to
plant trees on the campus
which at that time was quite
bare.

Most of the students then
went to the wooded area at the
back of the campus, dug up
small trees and replanted them
along the “D” shaped driveway
which then, as now, ran in front
of Chambers. The building on
this site was the original Cham-
bers building.

“Legend has it,” said David-
son, “that the old sweetgum
between Chambers and the
new Union is the tree that
Wilson planted.”

On the road between the
President’s house and Little
Dorm are two gingkoes, trees
whose species is.the sole survi-
ving member of an ancient
class.

Individual gingko trees, rec-
ognizable by their fan-shaped
leaves, are either pollen-bear-
ing or fruit-bearing; the fruit,
which looks much like a persim-
mon and is eaten commonly in
Japan, smells amazingly like
strong limburger cheese.

On the same road behind
Little there was once an entire

line of gingkoes of both types.
The smell of the fruit so
disgusted students that a num-
ber of them asked the administ-
ration to remove the trees, a
request which was soon gran-
ted, Dr. Daggy, who was not
even consulted in the matter,
was, to say the least, quite
enraged.

Dr. Daggy says that the
gingko incident was not the
only one of its type at David-
son. Although a number of
campus trees have been remo-
ved because of age or disease,
many interesting and educa-
‘innally valuable ones have
«ven cut indiscriminately, at
someone’s whim. But the worst
part is not just that the trees
were cut but that no attempt
was made to replace them.
Instead, in recent years only
common varieties such as dog-
wood and oaks have been
planted.

Noting the decline in types of
trees on the Davidson campus
over the past few decades, Dr.
Daggy said, “It should be
possible to have a beautiful,
well-landscaped campus and at
the same time preserve the
educational factor. Lately only
‘pretty’ trees have been plan-
ted--a variety should be
grown.”
