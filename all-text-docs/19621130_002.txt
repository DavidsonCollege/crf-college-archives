An Evening In The Village

“Its purpose is to liberate men physically, mentally, and spiritually; to

“o

educate the whole man... .

“We were very tired, We were very merry; We rode back and forth all

night upon the ferry.”

The two aforementioned quota-
tions are from separate sources. The
first is from the report of the Presi-
dent of Davidson College. The second
was written by Edna St. Vincent
Millay and was read in the course of
last Thursday evening’s Vagabond
Varieties.

Perhaps these two seemingly un-
related quotations are not unrelated
at all. . . perhaps.

The Vagabond troupe did indeed
ride back and forth all night. And the
Cave Counterpoint was crowded to
capacity during the duration of the
ride. A ride which for-the-most-part
only the Vagabond Ghetto appreciat-
ed. The Ivv Establishment seemed to
greet the ferry when it made a transi-
tory landing. but soon the voyagers
would disembark. leaving the Estab-
lishment in its “land of just add hot
water.”

Well. so what? What’s the point,
you ask. The point: “To liberate
men....’ In such-efforts as the Vaga-
bonds Varieties the Ghetto. achieves
the liberty it craves. But. it also at-
tempts to impose upon. the Establish-
ment the same liberty by force. Every
year the cry arises: “No one cares
about the Vagabonds. You can’t build
a drama group without student sup-

port.”

We are led to believe then, that
the Ghetto wants cheers, banners,
parades. The Establishment will never
confer such praises, for such acts are
not part of its nature. This lack of
overt enthusiasm does not necessarily
stem from apathy, but rather may be
attributed to a desire to stifle emotion-
alism.

But the Establishment is not sole-
ly at fault. The motif of the Varieties
was a coffee-house in Greenwich Vil-
lage. What the Ghetto failed to see
is that the greatest jazz isn’t played
for the listener. Poetry isn’t read or
written for people to hear. Arts in the
Village are for the artist not the aud-
ience.

Great works aren't met with

doesn't care. It just doesn't under-
Stand. If the Vagabonds need cheers
to be: free, they might well consider
putting their props into storage.
Liberty is a personal thing some-
times. That which liberates the crea-
tivity of one may not do the same for
all. A truly free man doesn’t need a
following. He is an individual .. . an.

An Investment With A Future

Education is in the news.

North Carolina, always an educa-
tion-minded state, is on the verge of
several changes that will make things
“bigger and better.” Governor Terry
Sanford plans to invite college presi-
dents from all public and some private
institutions to sit, in an unofficial
status, with the State Board of Higher
Education. It is hoped that this will
provide a new source of ideas and
strengthen the board at the same time.

Also in the offing is a university
branch plan similar to California’s.
And perhaps we can some day look
forward to a whole state system like
theirs—complete with  tuition-free
junior colleges enabling the majority
of qualified students to get at least
two years of a college education.

North Carolina, along with the
rest of the South, has realized that
education is the key to the level of
economic and social achievement on a
par with the rest of the nation. We
have no doubt that Terry Sanford
was speaking for all enlightened
Southerners when he said we need
“a new kind of emancipation procla-
mation ... to set us free from the
drag of poor people, poor schools,
from hate, from demagoguery. This
kind of proclamation can be written
in one word: ‘Education.’ ”

It’s a fine aim but it’s never go-
ing to be accomplished by the states
alone. Education is an investment for
the future with sure dividends. In
fact it is probably the “surest” in-
vestment a state could make. But the
South is not in a position to pour in
the capital needed to bring its invest-
ment to the national level. As San-
ford said, we have “the drag of poor
people (North Carolina is about 46th
nationally in per capita income).”
Hence we have a limited source of
State funds.

The only logical answer to this
dilemma is federal aid to higher edu-
cation. Sooner or later the Southern
congressmen who so vigorously op-
pose any federal aid are going to

ave to realize that their areas are

the very ones this aid would help the
most. Federal loans and grants are
needed now if the South is to become
truly “emancipated.”

The old arguement that aid means
control can be answered by simply
looking at the federally impacted
areas which now receive the lion’s
share of federal funds; the suburban
Washington area for instance. The
result is a superior educational system
without external controls.

And where is the place of the
liberal arts college in all this? We
certainly have a stake in the overall
educational picture. Russell Kirk,
however, used Davidson as an example
of the kind of school that would be
hurt if federal aid became a reality.
He stated, “governmental funds for
classrooms and dormitories will bene-
fit only the colleges that operate on
the mass scale—ultimately at the ex.
pense of the old liberal arts colleges,
whose alumni and benefactors will
pay income tax to finance the federal
program.” Of course he conveniently
fails to mention that our big benefac-
tors can get up to ten per cent deduct-
ed from their income tax by donating
to Davidson.

He assumes that these additional
funds, by helping things on a “mass
scale,” will somehow hinder things
at our level. Davidson has never (and
we hope never will) attempted to com-
pete on “the mass scale.” Davidson,
as well as most liberal arts colleges,
simply does not need the physical ad-
ditions that the state university needs.

But, by the same token, most
liberal arts colleges do need funds for
teachers’ salaries. The president of
Mercer University in Macon, Ga. has
predicted that church-related colleges
will not survive the next decade if the
teacher shortage problem, brought
about by poor salaries, is not solved.

Federal funds, while building the
bigger universities, can help the
smaller colleges to compete by rais-
ing their teachers’ salaries. In an
improved overall system there must
always be room for the high quality
education of the qualified few.

BY CHRISTIAN FABER-ROD
Richardson Scholar

A common expression about
Denmark is: “Oh, Hans Chris-
tian Andersen’s country!” In-
spired of this, I want to write
you a little story about’ a bird,
in H. C. Andersen's style.

Once upon a time. there was
a wonderful little. male bird;
his name was Tom. Tom was
owned ‘by a minister, such a
nice, lonesome minister. His
ehurch was placed in a tiny
town 20 miles from the big
alarming city. But out in the
countryside there was such won-
derful peace, and the minister
was such a peaceful man: Every
day he gave Tom seeds and
water, and what else a little
bird needs. For hours the min-
ister would sit talking to Tom
about God's son and about the
Holy Bible. When Tom was a
very little bird, he loved sittin
in his cage listening to the ole
lonesome minister; Tom lover
that son of God and dreamec
about. him during the nights.

As time passed Tom grew
bigger; he became a young

male bird. Still he loved
Christ, but. something — else
dominated his little mind,

something strange. He could
not explain what it was, but
the only thing he felt was a
desire to come out of this
cage — to live — and get air
for ali the strange feelings
that occupied him.

The minister -on the other
hand was still the nice old man,
and he could not really see any
change in Tom. though he had
noticed that. Tom's attention to
his talk about God sometimes
was very little; yes, sometimes
he saw that Tom was sleeping.
At other times he could sit with
his green rag with its blue white
and red mark over his body and
an obstinate look in his eyes.
But the minister was such a
nice, conservative man that his
mind was completely blocked to
new things. He thought that
time would bring his little
Tom's attention back again.

Then one day it all happened.
The minister was changing the
water in the cage when some-
body knocked at the door. The
old man would not think of let-
tingsanvbody wait, so he went
ta eee who it was, but in his ab-
sentmindedness he forgot to
close the door to the cage. Tom,
who so desperately wanted to
escape, flew through the open

Love Of Organization
Reveals Fear Of Self

BY BILL FERRIS
Davidsonian Staff Writer

“Search all your parks and
you'll find no statues to com-
mittees.” This comment, posted
on the library bulletin board
this past week, points out our
society's perverted love for or-
ganization.

We can certainly see this em-
phasis on the group in our life
at Davidson. In classes, worship
services, committee meetings,
and fraternities, the student: is
constantly a part of the group.
We have so de-emphasized the
individual that students are a-
fraid of solitude.

The presence of others hes
become a buffer against the
lonely emptiness thet each
must face when atone. We are
afraid to face ourselves. The
paradox here is that though
we may avoid the painful
search for meaning in life, we
limit ourselves to a very shal.
low existence, both in our
own thoughts and in our rela-
tions with others.

In the past, developments in
science, religion, art, and other

PEANUTS

disciplines have always been the
product of independent thought;
of men seeking answers by
themselves. Today very few
students are interested in inde-
pendent research. Instead, they
choose applied professions like
law, medicine, and so on.

Our relations with fellow
students have been strained by
constant group activity. The
tradition of “speaking” at Dav-
idson is a part of the skin-deep
friendships which we build a-
round us. We never go beneath
the smiling “hello” and the
questions about dating and
grades in our conversations.

This Is an unnatural life.
We are refusing to look with-
in ourselves and face the
depths of being which are so
much more a part of us than
the protective shields we
build in our group relations.

If we are to face life re-
sponsibly, these chains binding
us to the group must be broken.
We must first understand our-
selves as individuals before we
can live creatively with others.

window out into God’s nature,
though he did not think of it as
God's. The only thing was the
freedom. “Free! Free!” He sang
and flew up in the sky.

Here he met a lot of other
birds, and they asked him who
he was and where he came
from. “Oh, he was such a
handsome bird,” all the fe-
male birds thought. And as
they ruled the bird world,
they decided to give him a
party.

The night came, and all the
birds were together feathering
(the newly ivented bird twist).
They ate and drank; what they
drank was something the other
birds called “aqua-vitae”, life
water, as they laughingly said.
Tom had only tasted water in
his cage; the aqua-vitae looked
like water but smelled much
better and because he was thirs-
ty, he drank a lot and soon be-
came drunk.

He sat down and became sen-
timental thinking about a lot
of things; especially he began
thinking upon the nice old min-
ister and his talks about God;
then he asked if the other birds
knew anything about God and
the Bible. “No,” said the big-
gest bird. “Has it something to
do with food?” he askéd. “If
not, I am not interested.” All
the other birds agreed with him.

Then Tom really felt tone-
some; they did not want to
know God’s son, the son Tom
loved so much! He left the
perty deeply depressed and
started flying around, and
after some while he headed
homeward, in the beginning
slowly and hesitatingly, but
the nearer he came to home
the faster he flew, singing a
_ hymn he had heard the minis-
ter sing. The house was down
there and now he could see
the light in the room he used
to be in. The window was
closed but he knocked at it
with his beak.

The minister heard it. He
went to the window and opened
it. His own little pearl—Tom—
flew into the room and in
through the door to the cage,
where he sat singing. He saw the
old man close the window very
slowly and thoughtfully. He sat
down in his chair and started
talking to Tom about their mas-
ter; but one thing the minister
never did again was close the
door to the cage.

This was the story, and as
many stories have a moral, this
inas one too: MAKE VESPERS
VOLUNTARY! (Or do we have
to wait until somebody escapes?)

BY JOHN SPRATT
NSA Coordinator

In a sense, my last article be-
gan a broad definition of the
National Student Association
constitution. It was perhaps too
broad to be clear, and too am-
biguous to be fully understood.
In the next several articles, I
hope to give a general, but more
definite idea of the nature and
contents of the NSA Constitu-
tion. This is probably the best
way of explaining NSA.

The Preamble to the Constitu-
tion is a broad statement of
multifarious interests. Its ob-
jectives encompass every con-
ceivable field of student endeav-
or. Its scope ranges from aca-
demic freedom and academic
responsibility to international
understanding and equal rights.
In essence, it crystallizes the
ideals of NSA.

During the 1962 National
Student Congress, an amend-
ment was introduced, and
passed with some controver-
sy, to change the opening line
of the Preamble from, “We,
the students of the United
States,” to, “We, the members
of the national union of stud-
ents.” Insofar as | understand
it, the alteration was made
chiefly for clarity of purpose.
The organization remains 3
confederation of student
bodies.

This is borne out in Article
II of the Constitution. Only a

"student body can affiliate with
NSA. Moreover, it must be the
student body of an institution
offering more than vocational
courses and whose minimum

course is two years or more. Af-
filiation with NSA can be achiev-
ed through action of the stud-
ent government or by an author-
ized campus-wide referendum.
Conversely, the student govern-
ment or a campus-wide: referen-
dum can dissolve the affiliation.

Constitutionally, membership
in NSA means adoption of the
national constitution and pream-
ble, the regional constitution,
and acceptance of all by-laws.
Financially, it is an obligation
to meet all national and region-
al dues. Beyond this, there are
no binding obligations.

Due to an amendment pro-
posed this summer by Hank
Petterson of UNC, Article il,
Section D of the Constitution
now reeds:

“Membership in NSA should
not necessarily be interpreted
to imply agreement with poli-
cies of the National Student
Congress, the National Exe-
cutive Committee, or actions
of its elected officers. How-
ever, member student govern-
ments should make every ef-
fort to participate in the de-
cision-making processes of
NSA and support its policies
snd programs. to the extent
of their agreement with
them.”

NSA cannot “strait-jacket” its
collective philosophy on any in-
dividual member. In further ac-
tion this summer, the Congress
mandated the national office to
publish all minority statements
(those receiving at least 20%0
approval) with preceding major-
ity statements for distribution
on request.

Don Juan Vacates Hades
To Star In Bergman Film

BY STUART JAMISON
Chairman, Union Film
Committee

With a background of music
oddly reminiscent of Handel, the
Don Juan of Mozart comes from
the Hell of Shaw into the world
of the 20th Century—and the
results are hilariously and uni-
quely Bergman.

There is trouble in Hell:
Satan has a sty in his eye.
He calls his advisors, who re-
mind him of the old Irish
proverb, “A woman's chastity
is a sty in the Devil’s eye,”
and, after a bit of research,
locate the problem: a beautl-
ful young girl of the North,
in the country of Sweden, hes
reached her twentieth yeer,
is about to marry, ‘end is stil!
a virgin.

This uncommon situation can
not be allowed to continue, so
Satan summons Don Juan (who
for the last 300 years has had to
seduce a woman an hour, only
to have each one taken from
him just before completion) and
promises to take 300 years from
his sentence and give him sleep

INCIDENTALLY, THEY RE CALLED
"PERIODS ‘AND ‘QUESTION MARKS’

without dreams if he will but
return to earth and rid this girl
of her virtue. From here to the
end of the film, the antics of
Juan and his bumbling servant
Pablo fill the screen with some
of the funniest footage since
Harold Lloyd.

“Any criticism of a Berg-
man film, of course, begins
with the fact that it is fer
above the general run and
deserves a cultivated person’s
attention,” says Stanley Kauff-
mann, and THE DEVIL‘S
EVE is no exception. Yet the
film is not the typical Berg-
man thought-provoker; it con-
tains many undisguised belly.
laughs and much unadulterat-
ed corn. it is, in essence, an
elaborate Bergman prank,
and Brenden Gill of the NEW
VORKER recognizes the ob-
vious when he tells us that
“he (Bergman) brings it off
with ease.”

The naive Vicar, his evil wife,
his precocious daughter (You're
the 37th,” she tells Juan, “the
37th man I've kissed. I want to
collect 50 before I marry.”),
the little demon from Hell who
gets locked in the cupboard, and
of course, Don Juan and Pablo,
comprise a group of characters
that would keep an audience in
stitches were they merely play-
ing bridge, much less engaged
in the business of seduction.

Bergman has pleasantly sur-
prised us—he can be a very
funny man.
