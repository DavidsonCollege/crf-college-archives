CATS CRUSH WOFFORD

(Continued from Page 3)
The Maroons threw a big scare into
the sparsely filled gmy by sporting
a never die team which roared back
in the final stanza to come within
two points of catching the Cat lead.
The game never was on ice till the
last three or four minutes when the
Cats pulled ahead to a comfortable
12 point lead.

The Maroons jumped to a quick
8-5 lead after five minutes had
elapsed but the tall white clad boys
held a 10 point lead at halftime.

Slick Mike Williams poured 19
points through the hoops to pace
the Cat attack. Buddy Cheek rang
the bell for 16 and Ed White hit for
13. George swished the
chords for 10.
