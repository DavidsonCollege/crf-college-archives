Planning forinternships, summer jobs, orpost-
Davidson life can take up a lot of time that a lot of
students might not have.

Career Services, in Suite 414 Alvarez, offers
students help and advice while planning for
summer internships and post-Davidson
plans. The office :
can help find reli-
able contacts,
work to perfect
resumes, and
search for jobs
that fit individual
interests.

According to Libby Westley, Assistant Direc-
tor of Career Servces, it’s important to start
planning as soon as possible. She also encour-
ages job hunters and grad school applicants to
have a backup plan.

“Have several options that you’re pursuing,”
she says. ““There’s a balance between knowing
exactly what you want to do and being open to
other options.”

About 25 percent of Davidson graduates, she
says, go on to graduate school right out of col-
lege.

The rest are on the job market in some capac-
ity: interning, beginning a career, working a job
while figuring out long term goals.

The office is hosting a career fair on Friday,
Sept. 27 from 11:30 to 2:30in the Brown Atrium,
which will feature employment representatives
from companies including Wachovia, Gaston
County Schools, American Express Investments,
and the Southern Teachers Agency.

Recruiters will also attend from post-graduate
schools, like UNCC College of Architecture and
