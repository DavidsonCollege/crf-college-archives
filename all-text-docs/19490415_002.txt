Everyone is at first skeptical of
the validty of this neat little money-

it to see just-how foolproof it is and
have arrived at the following con-
clusions: A pyramider can’t be too

it requires an infinite number oi
subscribers for everyone to get paid
off. Before even one man (the top
man) gets $2048, it takes 2048 mem-
bers. This is why it wouldn't work
at Davidson unless somebody
figured out a simpler system. The
system stops when the source of
potential membership is exhausted.

Taking these facts into considera:
