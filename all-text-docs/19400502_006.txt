Every member of the student
body extends his sympathy to
Professor Thane McDonald in
the loss of his father on Satur-
day morning. :

Professor McDonald received
the .word of his father’s death
on Saturday, and soon aftery
caught a plane from Charlotte
to Elkhart, Indiana, where the
funeral services were held on
Sunday. When’ the Davidsonian
went to press, it was not known
exactly what day Professor Mc-
Donald would return from the
North. He will, however, be on
the campus the latter part of
the week for his regular duties.
