‘Go Not Gentle’, ‘Escurial’

Two one act plays will be
presented under student di-
rection Monday at’ 7:30 p.

it.
Rick Gourdin will direct
the two scene prison drama
“Go Not Gentle’ by William

psychological predicament of
three death row convicts.

“It decries capital punish-

Gourdin said that capital

ecuted in the United States
for the past two years.

“Go Not Gentle’ uses the
raciest language of any play
ever presented at Davidson,
Gourdin said. There has been
little editing to soften the im-
pact.
