Cats lose 3, but retain conference lead

By STOKES PEEBLES
Staff Writer

Davidson fell below .500 for
the first time since spring break
as the Wildcats dropped four
straight games last week. The
losses gave Davidson a 12-15
record but fortunately only one
was a conference defeat. The
Cats still lead the Southern
Conference with a 6-3 record.

Pfeiffer helped start David-
son off on the wrong foot by
beating the Wildcats 9-4. Jun-
ior shortstop Joby Merten kept
the Cats close by collecting two
hits in the contest. Davidson
then lost to cross-county rival
UNCC by a score of 5-2’as poor
defense plagued the Wildcats.
Crucial defensive errors hurt
Davidson again as they lost to

Citadel 5-2 Saturday in a rain-
shortened game. The game
against the Bulldogs was the
first of two conference contests
slated for Davidson last week-
end. Inclement weather preven-
ted the second game from being
played on Sunday as well. John
Haskell hit well against the
Citadel as he went three for
three and upped his team-
leading average to .402.

‘The Wildcats rounded out the
week with a 7-4 loss to Wake
Forest. The Deacons’ Brick
Smith hit a three run homer to
power the victory, and Cam
Zurbruegg led the Davidson
attack with three hits. Fresh-
man first baseman John Mar-
shall added two more hits and
scored two runs.

The Wildcats are p en

now and possibly the reason is
that the players are pressing too
hard. Co-captain Joby Merten
said, ‘‘Right“now we’re not
making things cin ate as we
were earlier, We’ the
ball’ well but’ Tight ‘at the
defense. If we relax, get our
confidence: back, and stop pres-
sing, we'll start winning
again.” Junior John Porter is
evidence that consistency is the
key as he is hitting over .360.
_ If the rest of the team Can
play with such consistency,
Davidson will soon be back-on ~
the winning side. Their next
opportunity comes against East
Tennessee State this Saturday
as they play a conference doub-
leheader in Johnson City.

Intra-squad game ends spring football

By VAN BECK
Sports Editor
A cobra-like offensive attack
coupled with a short-handed
defensive unit characterized
Davidson’s intra-squad football
scrimmage held Friday after-
noon. The scrimmage, which
culminated spring practice for
the Cats, was an offense versus
defense affair and came off
about as Coach Ed Farrell
expected.

THE BRICK BROTHERS
One of our more avid physics

major readers has submitted to
us a wonderful essay. We think
one and all will find the senti-
ment glorious, if not beautific.
The sheer magnitude and force
of this deep expression of a
young man’s feelings will touch
your very heart. I hope you
appreciate this as much as we
do. ?
Silence Is Golden

In the hustle and bustle of
our modern day world, we often
forget to appreciate one of life’s
simpler pleasures: silence. In-
stead, our society seems to
place high values on all the
things that make the most noise
such as power-packed stereos
and high speed cars. Perhaps
some .of the aggressiveness in
our world could be muted if our
leaders were allowed to enjoy
the solitude of a glider plane
rather than the constant roar of

_ a jet engine.

Unfortunately, finding quiet-
ude can be hard nowadays.
Even as one wakes up with
sunrise in the morning he hears
not the silence of the still dawn

air, but the sound of his neigh-
bot’s Volvo as he returns from
the midnight shift at the plant.
Simply getting away from one’s
fellow man, the source of most
of the unnecessary noise in the
world, can often be heard in
today’s field or forest can be
more than an hour’s drive from
many of our metropolitan cen-
ters. With the difficulty of
finding silence in our modern
world, it is no wonder that so
many people are nervous
wrecks.

In addition, people today
have a hard time appraising the
value of silence. Too many
people fail to realize the impact
of a teacher’s cold stare on a
young child. They would prefer
to yell and scream to get
someone’s attention. Also,
many people feel that if one
method is faster it is necessarily
better. They would always
choose a noisy motorboat ride
over a quiet sailboat. Unfor-
tunately these same people miss
some of the best things this
world has to offer.

Perhaps if more people would
take time out to think about the
value of quietness they could do

if it's by Vonnie, it’s got to be good

.... OF at least inexpensive

something about the over-abun-
dance of noise in the world.
Then, perhaps more people
would be able to enjoy life’s
golden silence.

Hopefully, we can work to
reverse ‘these’ tendencies,
though. If more people would be
more considerate in their ac-
tions, then maybe silence would
become more abundant. Our
world could be made much more
pleasant if peopie would only
realize that silence is golden.

Afterall the pure, unadulter-
ated garbage we've offered you
the first 25 weeks of this year
we think this is a welcome and
sincere respite. This essay reaf-
firms one’s faith in the spiritual
quality, not to mention the
writing ability, of the Davidson
student body.

A happy and belated Easter
present from Bonehead and the
Brick Brothers. Love to all.
Later.

head coach one can never be
completely satisfied with the
spring game. In an offense
versus defense scrimmage you
can supply hope that neither
side dominates the other..If
such a situation presents itself,
then a worrisome summer tends
to ensue. In our position how-
ever, a strong performance by
the offensive unit could’ve been
predicted.”’

Farrell substantiated such a
statement with three reasons,
which shouldn’t be confused
with excuses. First, the Cats
were missing key defensive
performers, four of whom
should earn starting berths.
Injuries obviously mean that
the total number of players on
the defensive side is down which
is. analogous to fatigue for
downlinemen who have to go
the entire distance without a
break, which several players
were forced to do. Last, Farrell
remarked in a straightforward
manner that, ‘‘We are a good
offensive football team and

possess dangerous weapons.”

The scrimmage itself saw the .

offense, led by quarterback
Brian Whitmire, outscore the
defense 43-21. (Don’t ask about
the scoring system.) Whitmire,
who should have the position to
himself this year, completed
seven of twelve passes for 125
yards and three touchdowns.
His stats might have been
greatly improved: had not two
big-play balls been dropped.
Halfback Alvin Atkinson pick-
ed up 147 yards on eleven
carries to nicely. compliment

Whitmire’s arm. He caught a 67
yard TD and also clipped off a
73 yard run. As a result of
Whitmire and Atkinson’s ef-
forts, the offense — out
560 total yards.

One unfortunate note con-
cerns Gifford Piercy, David-
son’s fine split end. After
catching a three yard touch-
down pass early in the scrim-
mage, Piercy later went down
with torn ligaments and was
operated on Sunday. He should
however, be*well by September.

. The defense performed ad-

mirably considering that James
McClark, Charles Hooks, Billy
Price, and Mark Fahey failed to
suit up because of various
injuries. A fifth regular, John
Bazos, was cut down early with
a knee injury. The bane-of a
year ago was once again in
evidence however as big plays
hurt the Cat defense Friday
afternoon. Hopefully, with the
return of the above mentioned
Davidson can display some
consistency on the defensive
side by the fall of 1980.
- Coach Farrell, in assessing
spring practice, commented,
“Overall, our staff is pleased;
it’s been a good spring and
we've had good effort. The
people that we'll be counting‘on
next season have substantiated
our confidence and should come
through. Our schedule’ will be
challenging but the football
team that will take the field
against Springfield College on
September 6 will be the most
talented group in my tenure at
Davidson.”
