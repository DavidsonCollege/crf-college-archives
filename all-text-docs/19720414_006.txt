New Management At ‘Den’

April 14, 1972

The Dautdeorian

Introduces Original Ideas

By ALAN FORD
Staff Writer

The first thing one notices
upon entering the Wildcat’s Den
is the change in its interior ap-
pearance. Brighter lights and
new red and white checked ta-
blecloths do a lot to produce a
pleasing effect for the eyes. So
do the attractive window deco-
rations. All in all, the new own-
ers have done an excellent job
of sprucing up the Den.

Not all of the changes are
readily apparent to the eye,
however. Will Campana, a for-
ner Davidson College assistant
football coach, and Robert Mc-
Clary, a Certified Public Ac-
countant from Kannapolis, have
also made some changes in the
menu. Some of the items al-
ready on the menu were cut in
price and several new foods
were added to it. The new items
are steak dinners, Greek salad,
chef's salad, a Mexican dinner,
Italian sausages and submarine
sandwiches.

According to Campagna, one
of the biggest changes is ‘‘that
now we have definite hours
when we are open.” Monday
th.ough Thursday the Den is
open from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. for
lunch and then from 4:30 to 11
p.m. at night. On Friday and
Saturday the Den is open from
11 a.m. to midnight. The Den is
also open on Sunday now from

6 to ll at night.

Besides Campagna and his
wife, who is in the Den during
the lunch hour, the staff includes
Campagna's brother Carl and
his wife. Carl Campagna serves
as the manager of the Den and
is to be found there full-time.
Six additional staff members
work at the Wildcat’s Den, four
of whom are Davidson College
students.

Campagna stated that the bus-
iest times for the Den are
lunch, from 5 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.,
and from 9 p.m. to closing time.
The businest day is Saturday,
“especially from 4:30 on.” Cam-
pagna said that ‘‘the poor traf-
fic of customers from 2 to 4:30
is the reason that we close in
‘he afternoons.”

The main reason for the huge
success of the lunch service is
the large numbers of workers
from area plants coming in to
eat. The lunch crowd is mostly
one of adults. The afternoon
crowd is a mixture of students
and adults. “As far as how
many people we serve a day,
it’s kind of hard to say. We re
ally haven’t been here long
enough .o come up with an ac-
curate average. The number
varies anywhere from about 84
low to 264 high,” Campagna re-
marked.

Campagna admitted that there
are some problems to running a

restaurant. The two biggest
problems are ‘‘people underage
trying to order beer and people
loitering,|" he said. Another
headache cited is the difficulty
of figuring overhead, salaries,
bills and food prices.

But the restaurant business al-
so has its rewards. One of the
biggest rewards for Campagna
is the faci that, “I get to see a
lot of people that I know.” He
enjoys meeting new people and
running the Den gives him the
opportunity to do just that.

DCPC Minister Recognizes
Youths’ Search For Truth

By PHILIP BISHOP
Contributing Editor

John Rogers, Davidson’s new
Presbyterian minister, believes
the common denominator of to
day’s youth culture is the
“search for a dimension of
transcendence.”

“The quest for truth is the
strand running through phenom-
ena like the Jesus revolution,
transcendental meditation, sensi-
tivity training, and drug experi-
mentaticn,” Rogers said.

“Any search for purpose or

community has some legitimacy,
but these can be dead end
streets,” remarked Rogers.
‘We should be leery of any-
thing which bypasses or short-
circuits the mind,”he added.
“There is a resurgence of pi-
cty among young Christians to
day which often leads to a me-
dieval belief in faith healing
and demons,” said Rogers.
“The Jesus revolution’s em-
phasis on feeling and emotion
has led some to a fundamental-
ism much like that found in the

rural South,” Rogers stated.

“Although these youths main-
tain their social concern, any
fundamentalism is more fear
than faith,’ he added.

Rogers, a Davidson graduate,
nas always been involved in
campus ministry. He taught at
Presbyterian College in Clinton,
South Carolina and more recent-
ly was pastor in a church near
Duke University.

“The most effective campus
ministry I have seen was a col-
lege chaplain who also served
as an associate pastor for a
church congregation,” Rogers
said.

“] was campus minister and
faculty member at Presbyteri-
an, and that worked well, too,”
he said.

“IT think a campus minister
should represent the church
without apology, and he should
be identified with a docal con-
“regation,” Rogers added.

Rogers hopes to increase his
church's impact on the relation-
ship between townspeople and
students.

“Although Davidson is re-
markably free from the town
xown tension often found in a
college - dominated town, the
church can increase dialogue
within the community,” Rogers
said.

“T'd like to involve students
in ostudy groups with church
members, and expand the forms
of worship within the church,”
said Rogers.

last week, winning four of five
debates, and bowing to Wake
Forest in the overall rankings
by one point.

The varsity team finished the
day 4-2, tied for third, but de-
feated the first place Wake For-
est team which finished 5-1.
John Douglas, sophomore, and
Rick Damewood, freshman, de-
bated for the varsity.

Individual honors were brought
back by Phillips, a first in his
division, Mitchell, fifth in his
division, and Douglas. 2 third in
his division.

Debate coach Mrs. Jean S.
Cornell said of this year’s team,
‘They worked awfully hard and
I'm pleased with what they’ve
done:”

She pointed out that “‘in all
our debates we have scored high
in speaker points.” This has
been reflected by the individual
honors won at Wake Forest.

Besides Douglas, Damewood,
Mitchell, and Phillips, regular
team members this year have
included Junior Bill Eskridge,
sophomore Tom Kent, and
junior George Kaneklides.

“Off-and-on, half a dozen other
students have shown interest,

5s

and we hope to build next year,”
said Cornell.

Participating in twelve meets
this year, the team has primar-
ily debated the national debate
topics, ““Resolved: That greater
controls should be imposed on
the gathering and utilization of
info: mation on U.S. citizens by
government agencies.”

The .eam made trips to Chap
vl Hill, South Carolina, Georgia,
and American University in put-
ting together a 52-38 season.

A trip to Princeton and a re-
turn match held last week at
Davidson involved informal de-
bating on topics chosen just pri-
or « the debate. Cornell said,
“We're going to try and do
more of this next year.”

Eskridge added, ‘‘It makes it
more interesting and fun for the
audience.”

Next year the team plans w
have home-and-home matches
with. several individual schools.

Three terms of participation
in debate next year will also
court for extended studies, ac-
cording to Cornell.

There is also a workshop for
interested students planned for
next year.
