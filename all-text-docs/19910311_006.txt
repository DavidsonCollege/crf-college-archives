Professor McCulloh Examines Academic Publication

To the Editor:

Itis worth noting that the recent
Davidsonian article “Publish or
Perish’? Faculty Says Teaching
Comes First” includes the remark
that “[t]he generation that’s com-
ing in” believes “scholarship is
important.” This statement would
seem to suggest the obverse is true
-- that most teachers at Davidson
now, as well as the “old guard” that
has retired, are not interested in
scholarship. “Scholarship” is of-
ten used nowadays as a code word
for the publication of scholarly
articles, not merely for the act of
studying and reflecting.

There are two reasons to be
circumspect about certain notions
about research that “linger” on
campus. First, we should avoid
what some colleagues are calling
“institutional amnesia.” For in-
stance, if one examines Faculty
Activity Reports from years back,
one finds a not unimpressive list of
publications -- products of respect-
able scholarship -- on the part of
the Davidson faculty. Faculty
members hired since the lastchange
in administration are certainly not
the only ones who have pursued
scholarship while teaching at
Davidson. Professor William P.
Cumming’s prolific and valuable

as others have before and since, the
direct connection of these balloon-
ing publication numbers to increas-
ingly legalistic tenure and promo-

tion requirements in the academy. °

As he said, “the bulk of scientific
publication -- perhaps this should
also include all scholarly publica-
tions, in the humanities and social
sciences as well as the natural sci-
ences -- is consciously set in type
knowing beforehand that it is of
serious interest to nobody.”

Of course, Georg Mann was
dealing in hyperbole. Some fields
in fact command a much broader
interest than he indicated, and itis
undeniable thatall publications are
of interest at least to their authors
and those author’s academic deans,
if to nobody else.

How did we get where we are
now? Those, like historian Rich-
ard Hofstadter, who have studied
the development of institutions of
higher education in this country
point out that the present linkage
between teaching and publishable
research is rooted in America’s
imitation (beginning with the
graduate school at Johns Hopkins
University) of the German univer-
sity of the 19th century. Graduate
(and to some extent undergradu-
ate) education in this country has

Many of those younger teachers coming to
Davidson now have been trained in graduate
schools where publication of scholarly articles
and books is seen as academe's raison d'etre.

writings come. immediately to
mind, although there are many,
many others who did and do fine
scholarly work at Davidson, al-
though not all had or have the
professional ambition to produce
frequent publications.

Second, we should try to de-
termine what the issues at stake
behind the “publish or persish”
controversy really are. Instead of
suggesting the new generation
thinks scholarship important, we
might best reformulate the state-
ment: “Many of those younger
teachers coming to Davidson now
have been trained in graduate
schools where publication of schol-
arly articles and books is seen as
academe’s raison d'etre. They
will pursue publication for that
reason, as well as a) in order to
strive for tenure at Davidson, and
b) tokeep themselves ‘marketable’
should they be denied tenure at
Davidson after the six-year proba-
tionary period. Publication, i.e.,
publication with the ‘right’ pub-

‘ lishers, equals professional suc-
cessand the respect of colleagues.”
I do not wish to suggest by any
means that genuine scholarly in-

terests aren’t at work, or that pub- _

lishing is a kind of mercenary ac-
tivity, but only to indicate the
source of the pressure to publish.

As long ago as 1972, Georg
Mann pointed out the vastly ex-
panding number of scientific pub-
lications (427,000 articles annu-
ally in the late fifties; 1,200,000 by
1960; 2 million by 1965) and noted,

since before the turn of the century
modelled itself increasingly after
the Central European example,
which emphasizes specialized re-
search in a seminar setting. Meth-
odology was and is considered
more importantthan “Stoff’ (facts,
material) whereas in England,
Holland and elsewhere, under-
graduate study was directed at
obtaining acommand of the tradi-
tions of a broad field of inquiry,
with specialization beginning only
at the level of advanced degrees.
In the German system, how-
ever, there is, to begin with, noreal
equivalent of the baccalaureate. At
German universities in the 19th
century, students -- already highly
educated in the classical languages,
mathematics and science -- at-
tended the lectures of scholars and
scientists who read from their own
specialized research papers and
notes. Students already had the
academic preparation for partici-
pating in the projects of the profes-
sors, and often the professors used
the seminar papers of the students
in publications (traditionally with-

out attribution).

Germany produced renowned
scholars and scientists we might
today call “research entrepre-
neurs.” Their reputations in spe-
cialized fields allowed them to
move from university to univer-
Sity, settling down fora time wher-
ever financial and research condi-
tions were right for them. Thus,
this system stands in direct con-
flict to the Anglo-American tradi-
tion of institutional loyalty once
associated with the faculties of
small colleges and private board-
ing schools. It is, however, a sys-
tem that has long been filtering
down and affecting institutions
beneath the graduate level. Indeed,
graduate schools produce the teach-
ers who come to a college like
Davidson, and it is only natural
that their training, directed toward
research and publication, should
play an imortant part in their aca-
demic careers. The point is that the
German argument (there is no re-
spectable teaching at the univer-
sity level without ongoing original
research) should be seen in histori-
cal perspective.

An additional point should be
made. Not all fields are the same in
relation to research and publica-
tion. Laboratory work and classi-
cal philology, for instance, are two
very differentactivities. Ironically,
the humanistic disciplines, whose
legitimacy was challenged by the
“hard sciences” in the course of
the 19th century, have done much
to make themselves seem more
scientific. Aware that their work
was not as self-evidently valid to
most people as say cancerresearch
or technical experimentation, lit-
erature scholars and linguists have
strived to publish specialized ar-
ticles written in specialized jargon
much the way a chemist might
publish the results of anew experi-
ment. Again, I am not dismissing
the activity outright, only pointing
out the source of publication pres-
sure in the humanities: the desire
for professional legitimacy.

In the end the controversy is
not really a dispute about the mer-
its of publishing, however, but an
argument to what extent “schol-
arly productivity” can be used to
make personnel decisions -- it’s a
dispute about how to decidewho
"perishes." At most institutions of
higher education, young teachers
have only six or seven years to dis-
tinguish themselves with the pub-
lication of articles and reviews.
Thus, the pace of their early schol-
arly work is set by bureaucratic de-
mands for accountability.
Sincerely,

MARK R, McCULLOH
Associate Professor of German

The Good,

The Bad

and the Human |

By Derrick Willard

Well, another week has flown
by at good ol’ Davidson. The
winter rains have continued to fall,

the skunks have continued to scurry -

and stink, and my hall has received
new showercurtains. Soit goes, as
they say. For seniors, it is the
paling of the age of “collegeness.”
Freshmen and sophomores wan-
der about quite oblivious, but jun-
iors are beginning to experience
the turning of wheels that is oc-
curing and has occurred in many

Imbued with the wisdom of four
years of Davidson academia,
many seniors have become intro-
spective, retrospective and some
just spective

seniors’ minds. Imbued with the
wisdom of four years of Davidson
academia, many seniors have be-
come introspective, retrospective
and some just spective. Others of
the class do not and may never
really have a perspective.

I was struck by the introspec-
tive article by Trevor Wade in last
week’s Davidsonian. I think itis a
good example of this soul-search-
ing that many (upperclassmen
especially, something to do with
maturity) develop as a result of a
liberal arts education. Trevor is
extolling the virtues of her educa-
tional experiences--she sees the
benefit of open eyes and an open
mind. But I think she hints at a
deeper issue in the beginning of
her article, one she does not fully
address.

I believe, too, in the value of
self-examination and shedding
ethnocentric ideas; I think it is an
essential part of human growth.
But Trevor links the idea of ethno-
centricity to good and evil. I think

she is battling with two distinct
issues.

The first issue is ethnocen-
tricity. Ethnocentricity can lead to
assertions of superiority and mis-
understanding--stubbornness that
leads to conflict. Trevor begins to
tie the recent Gulf conflict to eth-
nocentricity. That’sacomplicated
argument which has been struggled
with for months. I personally do
not think the war can be explained
so easily. That certainly could be
the subject of an entire book.

The second issue, the deeper
issue, is the nature of man. Is man
good or evil by nature? If man is
good, why do men fight? Some-
times the answer may be ethno-
centricity (the belief that one cul-
ture is superior to others), but I
think the Nazi regime-presents-a
better example of this during World
War II. If man is evil, then yes
Trevor, war is natural. This is a
subject debated for centuries.

And in the end, I think the
answer is man is both good and
evil by nature. Have wenotlearned
that rarely if ever is one answer
absolutely right? Consider this
similar or a part of the “nature-
nurture” debate. Isman shaped by
his genetics or his environment? Is
it not obvious that he is shaped by
both? Man certainly has the capa-
bility for good and evil, and proba-
bly uses whichever best favors
survival. ;

So in my opinion, man is good
by nature but also bad. So too is
Miller Lite less filling but also
tastes great.. This is not admonish-
ment, or a proclamation of truth,
just another perspective. Hope-
fully readers with open eyes and
minds will find something they
appreciate,

ogy major from Laurinburg, NC.
