Davidson’s Review Weary Students Visit
“Little Theatre Just Off Highway 21”

At least once a week most of
the students here at Davidson de-

and that they need a change from

sors, so they spend two hours and
thirty-two cents to get away fron
it all at the “little theater just off
Highway 21.’ Usually two or three
such escapists plan their -night of
in the afternoon and
prepare for it by borrowing three
dimes ‘til tomorrow" from a buddy
and bottle
to the stud to collect the deposit.
Then they make a_ pretense of
studying, but usuajly end up by
dreaming up new ways to make a

to they
had promised ‘to pick up at Hugo's,
they draw near the blaring lights
that signify the best in the enter-
tainment world. Their hearts beat
faster as they approach the ticket
booth, each with his thirty-two
cents clutched tightly in his hand.
They carry their tickets a lengthy
two strides and present them to the
film tycoon who promptly returns
them to the booth for further use.
Meanwhile, the students who are
really loaded grapple with the candy
