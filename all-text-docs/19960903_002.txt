SGA Chancellor Adam Hickey resigns

Adam Hickey, who served as SGA Chancellor for one semester
last year, submitted a letter of resignation to SGA President Warren
Buford in August. Hickey, who would be a sophomore at Davidson
this year, said he will not return to Davidson this fall and is instead
attending Harvard University.

Hickey’s resignation from the Chancellor position half-way
through his term has left Buford in search of a replacement. Said
Buford, ‘“* We are actively seeking those interested in the position —
and we’ re confident we will find a suitable replacement.”

SGA Chancellor is the only paid position in Davidson’s SGA,
and includes a $800 salary for a full year — the new chancellor will
receive around $400. ;

The chancellor distributes minutes, handles finances, and serves
as an adviser to the president and vice president.

Computer Services to offer student Web Pages

This fall, Davidson will join the
ranks of many other colleges and
universities across the nation in pro-
viding its students the opportunity to
create their own web pages.

Computer Center employees

. Said they are in the process of devel-

oping an instruction sheet on how to

create a personal web page. These

instructions, they said, should be
completed and made available to students in the coming weeks.

Dave Robb: Philosophy is more than you expect

By JENNIFER STARR
Staff Writer |

Dr. Dave Robbisa Davidson's
new Visiting Professor of Philoso-
phy on a one year appointment.
Although he
is new to
Davidson, he
is not new to
this area of
the country.
Robb, aChat-
tanooga na-
tive and a
graduate of The McCallie School
says, “I was raised in the South so
it is nice to be down here for an-
other year.” ;

Impressed by Davidson’s
warm weather and friendly people,
Robb has formed a favorable im-
pression of the school although he
has only been here a few weeks.

Visiting Assistant Professor of En-

Najarian,
who always
knew . he
would be a
good teacher
and gained a
chance to
prove him-
self during his second year in gradu-
ate school.

At that time he began a career
that would take him around the
country — even around the globe
— and allow him to share his tal-
ents with thousands of college stu-
dents.

Najarian grew up on a small
farm incentral Pennsylvania, alim-
iting experience as far as travel.
“Cows and goats really tie you
down,” Najarian explained. Isola-
tion in a small town for most of his
life inspired a burning desire to
expand his horizons and led him to
apply to and be accepted by. Yale

Among the many new faces
around campus this fall is that of
Professor
Kristi
Multhaup,
who joins
Davidson’s
Psychology
Department.
Multhaup
comes to Davidson from Duke
University and is presently teach-
ing Introduction to Psychology and
The Psychology of Aging.

Originally from Minnesota,

Multhaup completed her under-

you will know them.” tant.

Like many students, Robb Robb offered these words of

wisdom for current students con-
sidering a philosophy course: “For
most students, it’s not what they
expect. Philosophy, as usually
taught in the United States, in-
volves lots of logic. It is much
closer to math and science than to
English and the other humanities.”

“Philosophy is hard,” he said,
“T don’t mean that to be intimidat-
ing, but when you come into a
philosophy course you should ex-
pect to think hard about things.”
When he is not teaching philoso-
phy orthinking Robb can be found

studies.

Upon entering college,
Najarian was a “far too serious eigh-
teen year old,” according to his
own description, who liked the Yale
teaching style’s emphasis on self-
study from textbooks. At Yale,
throughout his years as an under-
graduate and graduate student,
Najarian was involved in a variety
of literary and social activities, es-
pecially with outside writing and
editing. He edited the Scholarly
Journal and financed his college
education through free-lance edit-
ing. Although he explained, “I
know I did things outside of En-
glish,” English was obviously his
first priority.

After Yale, Najarian shared his
teaching talents with classes of Or-
thodox-Jewish men at Yeshiva in
New York City, stimulated the
minds of the young women at
Barnard, and explored the wonders
of the English language with inter-
national students at Polytechnic
University. He even taught En-
glish courses in Slovakia in 1994.

Of this international teaching
experience he recalled the excite-
ment of living in the midst of a huge
transitional period in that country

modified his major plans several
times while he was in college. He
entered Stanford planning to be-
come an engineer and soon became
interested in computer technology
and artificial intelligence. He then
decided to major in symbolic sys-
tems. At that point, he planned to
become a computer programmer.

However, as part of his major,
he was required to take “Mind,
Matter, and Meaning,” an intro-
ductory Philosophy course. In his
own words, Robb “fell in love with
it. The teacher was really good; he
really got the students in to the
subject. Because of that class I be-
came a philosophy major.”

— he left only days before
Slovakia’s elections.

In his teaching, Najarian
hopes to combine the methods of
two teachers who had the most
profound impact on him during
his college years: one quiet and
“picky” about details; the other
entertaining, able to improvise a
speech on any subject and spice
his lectures with humor.

Professor Najarian’s own phi-
losophy is to watch for phrases or
subjects that seem oddly placed
and ask: “Why is this phrase here?”

Away from the classroom
Najarian enjoys an odd musical
combination of classical compos-
ers like Tchaikovsky and alterna-
tive music such as Nirvana.

This music, he said, provides
a background while he is running
around campus or working out in
the weight rooms at Baker.

Najarian admitted that he
would like to return to Central
Europe someday (where he could
make good use of his German and
Slovak language skills) but is quick
to avoid any specific plans for the
future.

As he explained, “One tries
not to have plans in this field.”
