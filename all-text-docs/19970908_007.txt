LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Say something. Do something.

A former professor writes to the: Davidsonian and accuses the
College of, among other things, “cultivating mediocrity and demanding
conformity.”

And there is no response. None whatsoever. No letters.to the editor.
No opinions pieces. No nothing.

David Coppola, a professor in the Biology Department until two
years ago, was snubbed — at least in his opinion, that’s the way it:
happened — by Davidson’s tenure process..

And, in last week’s single letter to the editor, he exacted what he
thought was a bit of revenge. In a piece of writing he said was also being
distributed to the nation’s top 100 biology graduate programs, Coppola
attacked the school and all it stands for.

“Due-process and academic freedom do not exist at Davidson,” he
wrote.

Some more of Coppola’s bitter tidbits read as follows:

“Davidson is an institution that espouses a strong Christian ethic and
yet treats its well-intentioned employees, like myself, in a dastardly
fashion, denying them even a simple verbal explanation if they are
dismissed because they legally can get away with it.”

«You can expect despicable treatment from tenured colleagues and
administrators alike including verbal abuse and psychological
harrassment. Nor does the faculty have any real power (or will) to change
matters, since a few influential (rich) trustees control the institution by
fiat.”

¢‘Promotion decisions are notoriously arbitrary, or actually counter-
productive. given that obsequiousness is more highly regarded than
achievement!”

«Tn short, Davidson is probably the last place one would want to seek
professional excellence in teaching or research, though their posturing
and propaganda to the contrary can fool you for a while.”

Students, stand up for your institution. Faculty and staff, prove
David Coppola wrong. Or is he wrong?

Why students here — and seemingly everybody else, for that matter
— are so utterly lifeless when it comes to anything but school and’
business is debatable. But whatever the reason, something must be done
to remedy the situation.

Because if this school continues into such a downward spiral of
apathy, Coppola’s statements might indeed be confirmed, rather than
dismissed as worthless drivel.
