Committee Airs Proposals
For Speech, Drama Area

Unless the faculty and trustees veto the Curriculum Committee’s proposal, David-
son will have a new department of speech and dramatics next year with a new man in

charge. ;
According to Frontis W. John-

ston, dean of faculty and head
of the committee, the new de-
partment will not offer a major,
at least for the present. John-
ston refused to specify the
course offerings in the project-
ed department, since they are
subject to the approval of the
faculty at its next meeting.

He also declined to identify
the new man the college hopes
to hire to head the department,
sirice that appointment is also
subject to the approval of the
trustees at their May meting.

Johnston did indicate that
the new professor would
handle all aspects of the dra-
matics program, in effect fill-
ing the gap left in the pro-
gram by the now-final resig-

nation of Dr. W. F. Goody-
koontz as Vagabonds director.

Goodykoontz, who resigned as
director earlier this year, re
acted favorably to the proposal
to have a separate department
of drama and speech offering
its own courses. “Its a good
idea,” he commented.

But his. comment on the part
of the proposal that calls for the
hiring of only one man was less
favorable. He made two points,
one based on his conception of
drama’s basic needs, the other
based on past experience when
Davidson had one director for
both speech and dramatics.

Male Chorus Plans
Concert Program

The Davidson College Male
Chorus will give 4 formal con-
cert on Monday evening, April
22, in Hodson Hall at 8:15.

The chorus will sing several
early German numbers in their
native language. Donald Plott,
director of the chorus, comment-
ed that these numbers should
be of interest to German stud-
ents and professors.

Included in the program are
two pieces from “Quatre Petites
Prieres de Saint Francoise
D’Assise” by Poulenc. These
pieces are based on two French
prayers of St. Francis of Assisi.

Further variety in the pro-
gram will be added through
presentation of the work of
many contemporary composers.
“Grass” by Ferno Meath, the di-
rector of the Yale Glee Club,
will be performed. This piece is
based on the poem by Car] Sand-
burg.

Baritone soloist Doug Heidt
will sing Roger Wagner's ar-
rangement of “Lowlands.” Also
on the program are “The Raid-
er" by Homer Keller, and
“Holiday Song’ by William
Schuman who is president of the

Freshman Council Ends
Work For Current Year

The Freshman Council
1963 on Wednesday night.

The half-hour meeting center-
ed primarily around projects
for, and organization of, next
year's council. This year's coun-
cil had previously submitted to
Dean Richard C. Burts sugges-
tions for improving the Fresh-
man Orientation program and
freshman-faculty relations.

Four principal proposals drew
most of the representatives’ dis-
cussion. The most important of
these was the need to have the
officers of next year’s council
elected as soon as possible.

This proposal would cnable
them to do more planning and
work on Freshman Parent‘s
Day, the council’s main pro-
ject. Parent's Day this year
was handled almost entirely
by Burts and Freshman Ad-
visor Spud Stewart.

It was also submitted that
next year's council work closely
with the Student Council in re-
lating to the freshmen the poli-
cies and attitudes of the ad-
ministration on current issues
of interest to the students..

This would also include the
council submitting the fresh-

schools from every section of
the country were represented.
Debating the affirmative were
Bob Llewellyn and Harry Dan-
iel, who won six out of eight
debates, winning fourth place in
the 25-team event:

Debating the negative were
Bill Rule and Skip Jories, who
won one out of eight debates.
Overall, Davidson had a 7-9 rec-
ord and was in a four-way tie
for fifth place.

Wabash College won the
four-man team competition, and
the University of Alabama won

to send at least a two-man team
