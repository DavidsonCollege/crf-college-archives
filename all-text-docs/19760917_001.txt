EPC decides to terminate

: Pe Department institutes
New pay-as-you-go policy

By KEVIN SHELLY
Staff Writer

The Physical Education
Department has adopted a pay
as you go policy for athletic
uniforms, equipment, and
rental of storage space.

This plan replaces the old
system of uniforms, a basket
and lock for storage purposes,
and the availability of sports
equipment to all students at
no cost.

The plan «was originally
suggested by College Presi-

extended studies programs

By AMANDA HALL ¥
Sports Editor

The Davidson College Edu-
cational Policy Committee
(EPC) voted in late May to
recommend the discontinua-
tion of the Extended Studies
program, on all levels, effect-
ive September, 1977, accord-
ing to Chairman of the Exten-
ded Studies Committee,
Hansford M. Epes, Jr.

“The EPC has been charged
with studying the whole prog-
ram of the college and this is
only one part of it,’’ said
Vice-President for Academic
Affairs and Chairman of the
EPC, Frontis W. Johnston.
‘We expect to have the whole
thing completed before Christ-
mas, but we are not ready to
release anything right now.
We’ve made no final decisions
about it.”

“They (EPC). voted provis-
ionally and tentatively to rec-
ommend Extended Studies to
be terminated after this year,”
Epes said. ‘‘The implications
is that they will vote again,

but if so, why did they vote in
the first place?”’

According to Epes two fac-
ulty members will be elected
during faculty elections this
month to replace outgoing
members of the EPC. Also,
one new student member will
be added to replace Sam Craw-
ford.

After this election the com-
mittee will hold a revote on
Extended Studies, and recom-
mend the proposal to the
faculty for their vote.

The vote of the faculty is the
determining vote, unless Pres-
ident Samuel R. Spencer, Jr.,
overrides the decision.

Several years ago, the fac-
ulty voted 2-1 to maintain the
Extended Studies program,
according to Epes.

Dr. J. Harris Proctor and
Andrew Lamas, members of
the EPC, interviewed Epes,
Dr. John J. Young, and Dr.
Randall Rich Kincaid, Jr., the
three senior members of the
Extended Studies Committee
“at the directive of Dr. Spen-
cer and the faculty,’’ Epes

said, concerning Extended
Studies. ‘“‘They were looking
into a number of programs
that are not regular courses of
study,’’ Epes said.

“My own attitude, what I
told them, is that it’s a high?
risk program; you can get
away with murder for credit,’”’

as a means of cutting waste
while expanding the range of
athletic programs into new
areas due to. increased
interests and co-education.

“T was looking at it as a way
of saving money and putting it
where it would be more
meaningful,’’ said Spencer.

Factors behind Spencer’s
suggestion included the under
utilization of the old system
by students.

The entire. system was
geared to the needs of twenty
years ago when Physical
Education classes were a part
of the curriculum for all
students, . according to
Spencer.

The official Physical Educa-
tion Department notice, which
has not yet been distributed to
students, cites the problem of
theft as the reason for the
change, but fails to mention
any of the reasons put forth by
Spencer.

The memo, issued by Dr.
Raymond Stone, Director of
Physical Education, details
the new policy and includes a

price list for clothing and’
equipment.

The loss due to theft has
been estimated by Assistant
Athletic Director Tom Couch
at over $3,820 for clothing
alone and combined with
equipment the total loss
approaches $6,000.

Athletic Director Thomas
Cartmill called the new policy
a “consolidation of efficiency
in response to a lack of
personnel and lost equip-
ment.”

Cartmill stated that the
decision had been jointly
reached by himself, Couch,
Stone, and track coach Ster-
ling Martin. However, Martin
commented that the decision
was more of a ‘‘top down’’
decision to which the rest of
the department agreed.

Regarding the input of
Spencer into the decision,
Cartmill said Spencer’s sug-
gestion was in the form of an
“informal conversation rather
than a mandate.”’

Stone stated that student
involvement in the change was
‘moderate at most.’’ Cartmill
elaborated, saying that stu-
dents were not available this
summer but, ‘‘I’d be delighted .
to get student input.”

Ed Reese, sophomore, who
chairs a liason committee be-
tween the Student Govern-
ment Association and the
Athletic Department, stated,
“He (Cartmill) hasn’t said a
word to me. There has been a
distinct lack of communication
between the department and
students.“

There is no clear agreement
within the department as to
why such losses have occurred
because normally each student
is held responsible for what-
ever equipment he checks out.

By BILL HOLLADAY
Staff Writer

Last Wednesday Davidson College revealed its
plans for a ten-year fund-raising program with the

raising: $35 million.

The program is designed to culminate i in 1987, the
college’s 150th anniversary year.

The college outlined its plans for the money,
which will provide mostly for endowment, improv-
ing the physical plant, and annual operations costs,
but did not state how the funds will be raised.

College president Samuel R. Spencer Jr. made the
ofticial announcement at the office of North Carolina
Governor James Holshouser, who is to-be the
national chairman of the drive, on September 8,
followed by a reception at the Governor’s mansion in
Raleigh.

Former Secretary of State Dean Rusk (’31) wi
named honorary chairman, and chairman of trustee.
Dr. Warner Hall, along with the Trustee Develop-
ment Committee, was asked to supervise the
program’s progress.

At the reception,’ Davidson’s new vice-president
for development, Duane Dittman, remarked that he
was unable to fully explain the fund drive and how it
would work but expressed confidence in Davidson as
an institution, 'Trustee Hall described himself as an
“alien” to Davidson but echoed Dittman’s praise of
the school.

Hall suggested that the college need not raise any
money to remain open but said that $35 million
would help to improve the school, ‘‘keeping it one of
the fine institutions of its kind.”

Spencer explained that the money from the

drive

would be divided among four priority areas, as
established by the 1974-75 study of college
objectives by the Goals Committee. Thesé are as
follows:

$6 million for physical plant improvements such
as renovation of Martin Science Building, new fine
arts and athletic facilities, and improvements in
student housing, dining services, and the college
shop.

$8 million for student scholarships, experiential
learning, work-study programs, and other forms of
financial aid.

$11 million for academic endowment, faculty
research, international study, the Honors Center,
library book purchases, and interdisciplinary cour-
ses.

$10 million for relieving the effects of inflation on
the college’s annual operating budget, an unexciting
but necessary precaution.

Spencer said the program ‘‘is designed to
suarantee...the continuing financial stability of the
college and its work of high quality in educating
young men and women.”
