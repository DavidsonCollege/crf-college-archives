JOHN MACDONALD WEARN,

J. M. Wearn, ex-'19, will be remem-
bered by only. a few men now on the
campus, the Seniors and some of the
Juniors, as he dropped out of college
during his second year. But those of
us who knew him will hear with regret
of his death, the fourth Davidson man,
of whom we have record, to give up his
life in France, and the fourth Davidson
man in service to succumb to pneumonia
following Spanish influenza. ‘Tho be-
low draft age, he felt it his duty to vol-
unteer, and last spring joined the Coast
Artillery.

Wearn's courteous and pleasant dis-
position gained him many warm friends
while on the campus and his character-
istic. steadiness promised to put him well
ahead of the average, when he should
have gone out into the world for him-
self. His death is a loss te the world as
well as to his people. “The sympathy of
his class and all who knew him go out
to his loved ones in their grief.

EXPLANATION,

Putting out a paper such as The Da-
vidsonian may seem a simple matter to
esome. Bat working under, the condi-
tions to which the staff has been sub-
jected this year, it is emphatically not a
simple matter, “The general uncertainty
of evervthing for the last two months
has made the editing of college papers
no casy affair, But what we wish to say
frankly is this: All material for the
paper must be sent to Charlotte by Mon-
day night for Wednesday's issue. In the
last month things have happened in days,
which before tobk months to develop.
Peace was expected, but there was so
much uncertainty in the air, that it came
with a rather startling effect. So if mat-
ters should so change between Monday
and Wednesday that what news we
print is stale or false, don't blame it on
us, It’s the fault of the times. If the
8. A.V. C. should disband on a ‘Tues-
day and there should be none on the
camous Wednesday to read in The Da-
vidsonian that the §. A. ‘T. C. will con-
tiane to run thruout the year, don't
blame us. It's rather exasperating, after
all material has gone to press, to watch
events reverse news which is to come out
the next day. The staff is doing its best
to put out a live, newsy paper, but we'll
veed your comprehension and considera-
tion to make it a success. Any sugges-
tions or criticism will be appreciated.

The DAVIDSONIAN, November 20, 1918

THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIP,

At. last Davidson can claim a weil
earned State Football Championship.
After losing it hy one game for the last
two years, no one can object tu our
claim te that title this fall. In 1916
we lost the honor to Carolina by a to to
6 score, and last year to A, and EL by a
6 te 4 score, but this year the tables are
turned and our gridiron warriors have
brought home the trophy. Carolina's de-
feat Saturday by a ig te 7 count, tho
our only game with colleges in the State.
clinched firmly the championship in our
favor. The only other State colleges in
were A. and EF. and) Wake
Forest. Georgia Tech's overwhelming
defeat of A. and I. te the tune of 128
too, and V. PL T's victory over the same
institution 25 to oO, conclusively climi-
nate her from the race, Wake Forest's
defeat at the hands of Carolina (13 to
7) two weeks ago killed her chances
also.

We are looking forward with — the
deepest interest to our biggest: game of
the season, that with our “Phankspiving
rival, Clemson. From reports, Clemson
has a strong team this year, defeating
Citadel last Saturday 7 to 0. Coach
Ketver’s followers are not overcorifident
as tothe result next week. but crealize
that they have a good, old-time scrap
ahead, so that a close, snappy game can
be expected in Charlotte next week.
The friendly tho spirited athletic rivalry
which has been going on for the last
few vears’ between Clemson and David-
son has drawn the two institutions closer
together, and Davidson is proud to carry
on athletic relations with such an insti-
tution as Clemson, May they never de-
part from their present cordial .rela-
tions!

CHEER UP.

Lots of things have gone wrong lately
to our intense disappointinent. First
comes peace, with the realization of
never petting across, then comes the re-
scinding of the order for men. to report
to an ©. “VT. C., and fase comes the un-
certainty as to the fate of the S. A. ‘T.
C. itself. A number of men sav now
that they are anxious to get out of the
whole thing, but if it were actually dis-
banded, whether they would feel the
same about it no one knows. [t's a fore-
gone conclusion that if the $8. ALT. C. is
abolished, the colleges will stare ruin in
the face, as three-fourths of the student
hedy would have to leave college and
yet work, unless supported entirely by
their people.

Looking at it from some sides, we're
8. OL L.. but growling wont help any-
one out, Every man walked inte it
with his eyes open, so that now it’s up to
him to grin and bear it. Ut's® the best
thing in the world for a lot of us, both
in training, and, no less important, in
the realm of finances. It's not often that
aman has, his way paid thru a college
vear with a “salary” besides, and it's the
wise man who les low and hopes against
hope that Uncle Sam will continue to
carry him on the government pay roll—
unless that man is still living off his
folks. Let's take what's coming as a
matter of course, Tf we're stuck Satur-
day morning and have to wash windows
or dig trenches, or if we're confined to
the campus for five, ten, fifteen, etc.,
days—well, if we can't force a sickly
grin, at least don’t be a grouch and
make everyone else share our troubles.
Growling is disagreeable to everyone
else and gives no one any satisfaction.
Joking is the best way to let off steam
anyway.

We are confident that it has never
been “money” that has kept any coach
or player at Davidson. It has been that
indescribable thing known as “Davidson
loyalty.” May it ever be so, as long
as Davidson is “Davidson!”

MR. MOORE LEADS THE
SUNDAY “Y” SERVICE

The “Y" «service last Sunday night
was attended by a good sized crowd of
students in spite of the fact that the
weather was bad. The meeting is now
heing held at 6:36 instead of 6:45. This,
change of hour was made so that. the
meeting might not interfere with the
regular church service at 7:30.

The meeting was opened with the
usnal twenty-minute song service. Mir.
Moore then announced that he is look-
ing for his moving picture machine to
come on any train now, as it is already
overdue. A piano and a number of chairs
have also been shipped to him from At-
lanta. As soon as these arrive the Y.
M. C. A. amusement room will be mov-
ed across the hall of the gymnasium into
a darger room.

After making these announcements
Mr. Moore gave an interesting and
highly practical talk, taking as his text
John 15:15. “Henceforth | call you not
servants, for the servant knoweth not
what his lord docth,. but 1 have called
you friends.”

Speaking of friendship, he said that it
is one of the most sacred relations in the
world, and that the most pitiful thing
in the world is a man with no friends.
He showed that Jesus Christ the
greatest man and the finest friend that
ever lived and urged every one to take
Him as their friend for three reasons:
First. because of the effect on the man
who takés him: second, because of its
effect on others, and third, because of its
effect on his country.

Nevertheless, no ene can expect to
Rave such a friend without making some
sacrifices for him. Mr. Moore pointed
aut some of the sins which beset all col-
lege students, and closed with a plea that
wetiye up these sins as a sacrifice for
oumfriend,

STUDENTS ARE PLEASED
WITH TICKET PLAN

The local §. A. ‘1. C. is finding the
new plan of getting tickets for their use
at fetten and White Drug Companies
and Elliott's a very good one. ‘his plan
makes it possible for aman who has no
cash available to secure a ticket from
Lieutenant Dennard and purchase the
things which he needs. “The tickets is-
sued are each good for a dollar's worth
of trade; so that the tickets are not large
enough to use all of a soldier's pay un-
less he draws too large a number. The
student soldiers in purchasing — these
tickets are not only benefiting themselves
by being able to have money available,
but are also benefiting themselves by the
percentage commission which will be se-
cured thru the different stores in estas-
lishing the company fund. This can not
be appripriated by any one man: a com-
mittee will have charge of the dispersion
of the funds. These funds may be used
for athletic goods or amusements or any-
thing else the. committee decides is need-
ed. It seems that the company fund and
arrangement of tickets will prove a bene-

‘ficial plan for the §. A. T. C.
