In Auto Accident.

George Bascomb Sorells, ’23, narrowly
escaped serious injury, when he turned a
roadster in which he was driving from Char- |
lotte to Columbia down a steep embankment
last Tuesday evening near Chester, S. C., in
an effort to prevent a head-on collision be-
tiveen his car and a small coupe.

Mr. Sorrells, according to news dispatches, |

was coasting around a curve when he came
suddenly upon the light coupe, headed in the

opposite direction, and blocking the roadway. |

In the small coupe were Mr. and Mrs. Erwin

Christy, of Chester, and their small baby. |

Mr. Sorrell’s efforts to prevent a collision |
were hardly less than heroic, in view of the.

fact that he endangered his own life by |
turning his car down the steep embankment. |
A large boulder at the foot of the embank- |

ment caused Mr, Sorrell’s car to turn com-
pletely over, doing serious damage to the
machine.

RECENT GRA GRADUATE

Alumni and Publicity Departments
Have Increased Scope of Service
to College

Harllee Branch, Jr., of Atlanta, Ga., prom-
|inent graduate in the class of 1927, was elect-
éd last June by the Alumni Council of the
General Alumni Association of Davidson
| College as assistant alumni secretary, and
‘having aceepted this position, has taken up
| his duties.

The Alumni Council and the association as
|a whole consider themselves very fortunate
| in obtaining the services of one of the most
| outstanding seniors of last year’s class. His |
| brilliant record in a journalistic and forensic |
lactivities is well known to members of the |
three upper classes.

Early in his four years at Davidson he |
| was recognized as a writer of keen intellect |
Landis a speaker of marked ability. He served
in many capacities as a journalist,

but the |
| monument to his efforts rests in his excellent |
| editorship of The Davidsonian last year, pis |
| editorials being chosen as the best written by |
collegiate editors in North Carolina. |
For three years Mr. Branch was an inter- |
| collegiate debater, having represented the |
| college against some of the most formidable |
| foes of the North and South, and came out |
| successful. He won both the Junior and |
Senior oratorical contests and was class |
| Stator last June, and in many other ways |
| showed his genius on the platform. |
| Mr. Branch is particularly qualified for
this type of work through his ability to speak
land to write, but in addition he was a recog-
| nized d¢ader-on the campus, and such leader-
| ship will characterize his work with alumni.
While a student he was elected a member of |
Omicron Delta Kappa. Many other, honors
| were bestowed upon him indicating his out-
| standing prominence in many phases of col- |
| lege life. |
Alumni work at Davidson is still in an in- |
| fant state, having been established last year |
when Ernest Milton, ’26, was elected alumni |
| secretary. _ Under his directorship, the value
jof alumni interest was soon recognized, The |
combination of alumni activity and publicity
| for the college in the same office was recog- |
| nized as beyond the scope of one person if |
| either was to be effective, and as a result the |
| Alumni Council, which was established in |
June to direct the interests of the General |
| Alumni Association, chose Mr. Branch as
| assistant secretary. |
| These two men have collaborated on an |
intensive program of publicity and alumni
| expansion, and from time to time during the |
|coming year will put into effect measures |
which will be of vital importance to every |
| alumnus of Davidson. |
