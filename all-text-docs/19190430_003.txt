EU SOCIETY.

The regular meeting of the Eumencan
Literary Society was called to order by
_ the president, at the usual hour, Satur-
day, April 26. ‘The roll call showed
about two-thirds of the society present.
The subject for discussion was, Resolv-
ed, “That the R. O. ‘I. C. units should
be maintained in the American colleges.”
The arguments presented by the two
sides were weak and lacked everything
that would convince an intelligent body
of hearers. ‘The house wearied and fell
half asleep over some of the speeches,
only to be aroused on the other extreme
by some inspired and flowery Demos-
thanes, yelling at the top of his voice.

The affirmative was defended by Mc-
Ihwaine, McAskill, and Liston. “This
side rightly and justly won the decision
of the judges, by at least half way prov-
ing that it would benefit the individual,
college, and nation.

The negative was upheld by Robson.
McGirt, and Wilkinson. ‘lhe first of
these gentlemen had the best debate of
the evening and without any support
would have won, ‘The last two gentle-
men, resorting to personalities and stone
age argument, furnished the house with
a great variety of amusement.

The program for the evening closed
by a declamation on the “Death of
Gladstone”, by John Dillon, delivered
by McLaughlin.

Under the head of general business
the following elections took place: For
the Debating Council, Boulware and
McCaskill. For Valedictorian, Dendy.
For Respondant, McGirt. After these
elections, the recently elected officers for
the coming Fall ‘Term took their posi-
tions. President Askew delivered a
short talk thanking the society for elect-
ing him to the responsible position and
also stating that he hoped hereafter the
speakers would put an! honest effort
forth in preparing their talks. He an-
nounced that next Saturday night would
be the last of this year’s meetings.

PHI SOCIETY.

The only meeting of the Phi Socicty
last week was held Saturday night from
7:15 to 8:45. inclusive. The roll call
was very impressive. Next followed the
reading of the minutes of the last mect-
ing which was the most enjoyable and
novel part of the program. The at-
tendance was fine, nearly one-half of
the members of the society being present.
Several other members drifted in later.
In fact it is becoming good form to
get in late just as if the society was a
social function. Some of the members
must think that they are going out into
society instead of coming to a society.
The absence committee retired, as usual.
for the mail.

The debate on the tights of Oriental
peoples in the United States was un-

tthe late ex-president. = A

usually good. McGeachy, C. B. Alex-
ander, and Roberts did the honors for
the affirmative. Stone opened up for the
negative; Chalmers followed. and R. D.
Hall sounded taps for the debate.
Chalmers betrayed a working knowl-
edge of the customs of Chinese and it
is suspected that he must have put some
work on the debate.

Hall seemed to have considered that
his colleagues had already won the de-
bate and that there was no need for him
to speak. At any rate one would infer
this from the poetry, under the guise
of a speech, that he put up. or rather
put off, on the house. “Phe debate was
really excellent, in fact the best of the
year by far. Every man called for an
eXtra minute and put it to good use.

Big Possum) made an oration on
“Girls 1 Have Met.” ‘The talk con-
erned chemistry and also several mem-
hers of the house from the interest
manifested by them, anyway. Freeman
announced that he was going to enter-
tain the house with a one-man debate.
He quoted Roosevelt quite frequently.
in fact he really gave a declamation by
motion by
Spence was carried which gave every
society member one extra credit for
each credit he has made this Spring.
It is suspected that Spence has a per-
sonal interest in the matter since he got
nine credits by the motion.

AMMUNITION ARRIVES.

A wore military appearance was given
to Davidson last week when fifty-five
hundred pounds of ammunition for use
in the R. OJ TV. C. was hauled to the
campus and placed in the old Y. M. C.
A. building. If the guns arrive this
week, some target practice may be given
by the Commandant.

BELIEVES IN HARMONY.

The practical Reconstruction Aide
stopped in at the Orthopedic shop where
artificial limbs are made. She told the
size leg required by her patient and
gave other information, “The sergeant
showed her a pretty pink limb, with
hinges and everything.

“That will be fine,” she said. “And
now, paint it black, please.”
“Black !" said the Sergeant. “What's

the idea?”
“Oh, it’s for a colored patient.” she
said.

“More than any other war of history.
this one has heen fought for a principle—
for liberty and the safety of democracy.
Principles may be depicted in stone or
pictured on canvas, but such representa.
tions, however beautiful and .symbolical,
will not have life. A principle can live
only in the lives of men, and if it is our
purpose to perpetuate the cause for which
the great war was fought, we must con-
stantly reiterate and teach the principles
of liberty and democracy to each succeed-
ing generation.”

“This suggests that a memorial worthy
of the recent conflict be dynamic; it must
be a building that shall honor the dead
by immortalizing the principles for which
they made the supreme sacrafice ; it must
be a building commemorating the service
of the living by giving service, rather
than a statue or a shaft in which there
could not pulse the life blood of a new
day.” —The American City.

MATRIMONY A LA MODE.

A few words mumbled by a minister
constitutes a marriage. A few words
mumbled by a sleeping husband consti-
tutes a divorce.

—Exchange.

Dreamy—Her face is queenly and her
mouth is the mouth of a princess.

Hard Facts—Yes, even her teeth are
crowned. —Exchange.
