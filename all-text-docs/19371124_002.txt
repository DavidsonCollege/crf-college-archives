To lose God is to leave everything without meaning

or reason, to have no proportion of things, to drop
out all standards, and to reduce men and affairs
to chaos.—Chancellor James R. Day.

We express our sincerest sympathies to
Dr. G. R. Vowles in the recent death of
his father.

Thanksgiving...

“Christmas comes but once a year,” they

say. And to the average complacent human

being, so does Thanksgiving,

Thanksgiving is a fine day and has a fine
ideal and purpose behind it. It should call
for a.renewed spirit and relationship with
the Creator and the “giver of all good and
perfect gifts.” Dut more than that, it should
take the soul of a man from his own little
self-satisfied existence and place it higher

‘rin the scheme of things,
\s soon as Thanksgiving Day is over, the
person has nothing tor which to be
I | forsome three hundred and sixty-

r odd days. Is that your attitude ?

body seem to indicate some disagreement

rhis is the first ir in many a long di

that football has been so unsuccessful, dis-
counting all moral victories. Scattered opin-
ions have it that we just will not rank in
baseball or basketball. We have no concrete
knowledge as to the latter. However,
something is undoubtedly wrong. There

seems to be little hope on the future foot-

ball horizon.

Now just what is there to do about this
football situation since this sport is the most

immediate problem? The fact remains that
unless we-can offer some inducement ta
high school players, we: can not hope to

compete with many of the colleges we now

play. According to reports, Duke already

desires to drop us from her schedule.

Do we wish to drop from the Big Five to
a smaller conference group and discontinue
meeting many teams on our présent sched-
tle? No, Do we wish
to drop inter-collegiate athletics entirely ap
lately? Hardly.
Then all there is left is to offer some induce-

scholars to further their inter-
ests in music and to aid the College musical
department. Why should not football men
of ability be offered Scholarships to develop
their football ability at Davidson and to put
the College on its feet in athletic circles?

In our minds, this is not subsidization but
a logical and concrete system for improving
a situation that is steadily going from bad
to worse.

We wish at this time to thank The-Char-

their willingness to let The Davidsonian
use their cuts gratis. The average college

paper runs,only a fraction of the number of

cuts The Davidsonian does and this is due
to the inability of those schools to get hold
of the cuts. However, we are lucky to have
such close and friendly journalistic, neigh-
