Improved Wildcats Likely to Struggle i in Conference

By Bruce Balestier

If you ask the people Davidson |

basketball coach Bob McKillop
calls the “so-called experts”, the
Wildcats’ first year back in the
Southern Conference is going to
be an awfully long one. Davidson
is picked eighth in the 10-team
league by Street and Smith’ s, ninth
by the NCAA Basketball Preview,
and last by The Sporting News.
Andeven McKillop says that those
forecasts of doom are “‘understand-
able.” Those publications “pick us
_ based upon our previous perfor-
mance,” McKillop says, “and our
previous performance indicates
that we would struggle in the South-
ern Conference.”

In part, McKillop is referring
to last year’s 11-17 campaign, in
which Davidson finished tied for
fifth place in the Big South with a
6-8 record. That frustrating team
sometimes showed that it had the
wherewithal to hang with major
competition (as in a 66-62 win
over Miami) and sometimes sug-
gested that it could lose to any
team in the country (as in a 68-67
loss to Winthrop).

Most of the significant play-
ers from that team return, includ-
ing its top three scorers, junior
swingman Janko Narat, senior cen-
ter Detlef Musch and junior guard
Jason Zimmerman. One signifi-
cant subtraction was point guard
Frank Harris, who averaged 10.4
points per game as a freshman last
season but decided this summer
not to return to Davidson.

_ Zimmerman has been the

Starter at off-guard during each of
his first two seasons, averaging
12.5 and 11.8 points per game,
respectively, and possesses a deft
shooting touch to beyond 20 feet.
Buthe will begin this season as the
Starter at point guard. Zimmerman
has seen only limited action at the
point in the past, and the smooth-
ness Of his transition to full-time
Status will be critical to the team’s
success. Freshmen Chris Alpert,
Matt Grieser and Frantisek Babka
will back up Zimmerman, with
senior co-captain Matt Matheny in
a reserve role. ,
Zimmerman’ s shiftto the point

leaves a vacancy at off-guard, and —

freshman Jeff Anderson has an-
nounced himself the major candi-
date for the job with his strong
showing during the first three
weeks of practice. He slashed his
way to 14 points on 7-9 shooting in
Saturday’s Red-Black scrimmage.
Anderson is one of a group of
players capable of playing both the
off-guard and small forward.
Narat was the team’s MVP,
best three-point shooter and Igad-
ing scorer (14.0 ppg) as the starter
at small forward last year, and fig-
ures to be the starter there again.
But he will also spend time at the
big guard spot; Babka, 6’5" with
an accurate perimeter jump shot,
and Anderson will also swing be-
tween the two spots. Freshman
Brandon Williams is the best ath-
lete on the team, and gave the crowd
a hint of his leaping ability with an
impressive alley-oop dunk in the
Red-Black game. He should see

'92-'93 Hoop 'Cats
Top-Heavy With Freshmen

By Bruce Balestier

Chris Alpert
5711" 170 G
Muttontown, N.Y:

Alpert attended Chaminade
H.S. in Mineola, N.Y., the same
high school that produced
Davidson coach Bob McKillop.
As a senior in 1991, he was MVP
of the Long Island Catholic League
and was named to the All-Long
Island team. Alpert spent last year
‘at Northfield Mount Hermon
School in Northfield, Ma. He is a
scrappy player who figures to back
up junior Jason Zimmerman at the
point.

Brandon Williams
6’6" 205 F/G
Collinston, La.

Williams played at Phillips
Exeter Academy in Exeter, N.H.,
where his 6’9" high jumping abil-
ity earned him the nickname
“Ozone”. He averaged 25 points
and 11 rebounds per game as a
senior at Exeter, and was named a
Blue Ribbon All-American and
nominated as a McDonald’s All-
American, Williams is an outstand-
ing athlete who plays above the
rim; his primary position is small
forward, but he can also play off-
guard and power forward.

Quinn. Harwood
6’9" 215 F
Reston, Va.

Harwood began his high
school careerasa6’2" point guard,
and then grew seven inches in two
years. As a senior at South Lakes
H.S., he averaged 17 points, nine
rebounds and six assists per game,
and was named All-State and hon-
orable mention McDonald’s All-
American. Harwood has very good
shooting and 'ball-handling skills
for his size, and could see time at
small forward, power forward and
center.

Mark McGuire
6710" 235 C/F
St. Louis, Mo.

McGuire averaged 17 points
and nine rebounds during his se-
nior year at Vianney H.S., and was
named All-District and All-Metro

‘plenty of timeat both forward spots.

The starter at power forward
to open the season figures to be
6’8" senior J.D. Heuer, whos
several games late last season there.
He has range to 20 feet, but is
perhaps more valuable as a solid
rebounder and setter of screens.
Sophomore George Spain has been
effective in the post early in the
season, and should play at both the
power forward and center posi-
tions. Quinn Harwood, a6’9" fresh-
man, has power forward size, but
possesses ballhandling skills that
allow him to play every position
but point guard. Sophomore Tim
Caldwell is much improved and is
also an option at forward.

For the fourth successive year,
the Grand Teuton, 7’0" Detlef
Musch, will start at center. After
averaging 12.8 points and 6.4 re-
bounds per game last season,
Musch improved over the summer
in tryouts for the German Olympic
team. He should top the 1,000 point
mark for his career sometime in
December. Musch’s understudy in
the pivot will be 6’10" freshman
Mark McGuire. McGuire has a
pretty solid. inside game and runs
the floor and finishes on the break
extremely well for a center.

The seven-man freshmanclass
gives the team a much-needed in-
jection of athleticism, and, in re-
sponse, McKillop will enact a
faster-paced game plan. The team
will play aggressive half-court de-
fense, and McKillop says that he
wants to initiate the fast break, and
shoot the open three-pointer, at

in St. Louis. He runs the floor
exceptionally well for a big man,
and should back tp Detlef Musch
at center and see some time at
power forward. McGuire came to
Davidson for the chance to be-
come a Rhodes Scholar.
Frantisek Babka
6’°5" 204 G/F
Prague, Czechoslovakia

Babka attended Charles Uni-
versity in Prague and started at
point guard for Czechoslovakia’s
junior national team. His primary
position is the point, but his excel-
lent perimeter shooting makes him
an option at the off-guard position,
and his size makes him acandidate

every opportunity.

The schedule, of course, pro-
vides some major obstacles. The
‘Cats begin with three non-Divi-
sion J patsies, St. Joseph’s (Me.),
Tennessee Temple and Lynchburg,
but then will meet the mirror im-
age: consecutive dates with
Clemson, Wake Forest and UNC-
Charlotte. The 18-game Southern
Conference schedule is sure to be
more rigorous than last year’s Big
South slate, and a game with N.C.
State andanother with UNCC come
later.

The Wildcats should be fairly

competitive with the second tier of
the conference (the Citadel, VMI,
Westem Carolina and Appalachian
State) but seem to be a clear step
below the conference elite (Geor-
gia Southern, UTC andETSU). So
ahigh league finish seems unlikely.
Without a doubt, though, this is
McKillop’s mosttalented team, and
it figures to be much improved
over last year’s. But it would take
an improbably precocious year
from the freshmen for Davidson to
emerge as a Southern Conference
contender this time around. ~
