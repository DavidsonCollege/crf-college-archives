Philosopher Discusses
How Society Creates Values

By Alice Felmlee

Imagine yourself back in time.
It is now November 3,
1992. Election Day.
Waiting in line at the vot-
ing station yourealize that
although Bill Clinton may
be your candidate of
choice desirable platforms
are also held by Bush and
Perot. Each candidate
offers programs and poli-
cies which are valuable to
various groups of people.
How then is one to deter-
mine which “plan for the
future” is most valuable
for their own life?

This is a question
which philosopher Dr. Bill
Throop of St. Andrew’s
College sought to answer
on Thursday, November
fifth. How do we create
values?

The lecture began
with an analogy between the mean-
ing of friendship and the value of

Davidson
Cadets

Compete at.
Fort Jackson

By Caroline Lemley

‘During the Halloween Week-
end , while most Davidson stu-
dents put on their costumes and
headed down to the court, ROTC
cadets put on their BDU’s and
headed down to Fort Jackson, S.C.
fora weekend of training andcom-
petition.

The ROTC’ sannual Fall FTX
(Field Training Exercise) is held
annually with cadets from UNCC
to give cadets an introduction to
barracks life and weapons systems

while promoting teamwork’

through squad level competition.
Each squad, composed of from six
to nine cadets, competed in a bar-
racks inspection, confidence
course, road march, M-16 qualifi-
cation, and Drill and Ceremony
competition. The weekend ended
with an awards ceremony when
the winning squad was announced.

More important than the com-
petition was the teamworkinvolved
in each event. Everyone had to
work together to get over the 40
foot “Skyscraper” and to complete
the road march after an exhausting Le
day. The juniors had their first
chance to take over the leadership
positions and put to use the skills
they have spent the last two years
learning. Thisis especially critical
for the juniors who will spend six
weeks of their upcoming summer
at Advanced Camp at Fort Bragg.
The seniors spent numerous hours
preparing for the weekend and
grading the juniors on their perfor-
mance. They did an excellent job
ofrunning a safe, beneficial week-
end for everyone.

An uninhabited forest
becomes more valuable .
the less that is done with
it. ‘Amidst skyscrapers
and traffic jams a “virgin
forest becomes a desir-

The News Editor would like to apologize for the following errors:
-Dr. Zumwalt's new book was reffered to as a novel. It is a
biography.

-Mrs. Kimbrough was referred to as a faculty member. Shei is not
a faculty member. She is a staff member.

-Dr. Robert Manningis the committee head in the search for a new
chaplain.

-And finally, all the spelling errors were caused by computer
error.
