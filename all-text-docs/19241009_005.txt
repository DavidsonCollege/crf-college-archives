Bill Heston Writes of Extended

Bumming Trip

Made By

Reg. L. Price and Himself

As every Davidson student well knows, it
is strictly against all precedent or rules of
etiquette for a member of the Davidson stu-
dent body to pay railroad fare. “Bumming”
is the preseribed mode of travel, and by that
term is meant the accepting ef anything that
has the semblance of being free from rides,

meals, lodging, entertainment,

on down te
cigarettes and the matches thereto.
R. L. Price, of Charlotte, and Bill) Hes-

ton, of Atlanta, both graduates of Davidson
last year, have put in a claim as the cham-
pion “bummers” of College, and

and two days were spent with them. Two
days were also spent in’ Kaston, 40° miles

Lafayette, also the Bethlehem Steel plant
and the Ingersoll Rand plant. They saw
the University of Pennsylvania and Bryn

Mawr College, in Philadelphia. During their
stay there they heard the famous jazz or-
chestra of Vincent Lopez and Ted Weems.

Leaving Philadelphia they proceeded to
Washington by rail, stopping off between
trains in Baltimore. One day was spent in
Washington sight-seeing, and both boys de-
clared that it was the most beautiiul city
that they had ever seen. They visited sev-

eral of the government buildings: the White

House, the Capitol, the Smithsonian Insti--

tute, and others.

Thursday, June 26th, they donned the
khaki once more and set out for Charlotte,
reaching there on the afternoon of the 28th,
after 24 of
days of their lives. ,

During the entire trip 2,500 miles were
covered, out of which they only walked 30.
They were given rides by 75 cars for an
average “lift” of 32 miles. Each boy spent
$65.000, this including every expense.
enthusiastically recommend this as a novel
and enjoyable way to travel and spend a va-
cation, and also as a very inexpensive method
of seeing America first.

Professor Fleagle Makes
Address to Volunteers

Speaks of Power in Christ and
Human Need of This Same
Power

Speaking to the Volunteer Band last: Sun-
day morning, Prof FF. K. Fleagle discussed
in a very interesting manner the Power of
Christ. He read from the ninth chapter of
Matthew the account of the healing of the
afflicted woman who touched the hem of
Christ's garment, and based his remarks on
the power that was used to heal her.

“Christ knew that someone had been help
ed, because power had gone from Him. He
Was dependent on power just as we are, for
He never said ‘1 have power or 1am power,’
but He did say “All power is given unte me.’
In healing this woman some of His healing
power Was used, and He felt the loss of it,

“When power is used for anything, it is
gone and has to be replaced by more power.
There was a never-ending stream of power
fiowing into Christ to take the place of what
We
are constantly in need of power to perform
our Christian duties, and should’keep the line

Was used in doing His wondrous works,

of communication with Christ clear of all
obstacles which come between us and Him
and shut off the power from our lives. The

day of miracles is not past, for we can sec

them with accurate account the

TRACK DOPE

A promising squad of 30 aspirants has
survived the first two weeks of prelim-
inary track training. This experimental
grind has given Coach Tilson a good line
on the respective prowess and ability of
the individual candidates.

Immediate interest is centered on the
cross-country team. Several men have

and at least six of these are showing up

Rev. W. R. Coppedge, of Rockingham,

axe, found many years ago in New Zea-
land, by T. B. Neilson, a Scotchman liv-

last century. The Maoris were neolithic
men using weapons and tools of polish-
ed stone as late as 1770.
