THE DAVI

By JIM HAMILTON

An outdated rule cost the college thirty dollars last
weekend.

Bill Shinn, high scoring Cat forward, was forced to
fly from Bristol Friday night and back again the next
day in time for the King game.

And why? Because the archaic cut rule in effect
here prevented his missing two Saturday classes.

It is my understanding that Bill was not in grave
academic danger in either of the classes, but was forced
to attend only because of the prevailing system limiting
cuts in any three hour course to three a semester. Any
student who has taken the maximum number of cuts: is
not permitted to miss the class for a school-sponsored
trip. Bill had no reviews or papers due but had to be in
-class only because of the rule. .

This is not meant to alibi for Bill but to point out.
along with the criticism already leveled in the editorial
column of this paper, the fallacies in the present system.

I can remember when a Phi Beta Kappa was not al-
lowed to take an athletic trip for the same reason.

Coach Tucker was smiling broadly as I approached
for an interview, wading through the puddles on the
“pool room” floor and dodging the splashes of Catfish
still celebrating the victory over favored William and
Mary.

“Well,” I asked, “What about this upset Saturday
night?

“Hell,” Tucker growled, “Wasn’t any upset. Those

boys dian’t go out there to drown. We were in shape —
been practicing since way back in football season.

“They showed an awrul lot of heart in winning this
one. Why last week they worked out afternoon and night

Saturday's victory over Wil-
liam & Mary was somewhat of
an upset since the Indians had
defeated the Davidson squad in
Jast year's encounters and were
expected to be strong again this
year. In commenting on the
mect, Coach ‘Tucker readily
praised his team for “their
great amount of desire and
spirit.”

An important factor in the
win was the effort of John Scott
who won the breast stroke
y events. defeating an oppdnent

years, but losing cach time by
a slim margin.

Jack Rose, who came out of
the infirmary last Saturday to
win the diving, has been back
at practice and should be back
in top shape for tomorrow’s ac-
tion.

FRESHMEN PRAISED

Coach Tucker also had a great
deal of praise for his freshman
team and added that if any
more freshmen are interested
in coming out they should do
so. Tucker said. “I expect to
see some of these bays break
several records before they
leave Davidson.”

A final note of praise was
‘directed at team captain Bob

mines a terrific leader and
definite boost to the general

Sgt. McCurry says that this

er than last year’s, should move
the team from twenty-eighth
