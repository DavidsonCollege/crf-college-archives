The College Christian Endeavor So-
ciety held its regular meeting in Shearer
hall dn Sunday evening at 6:10. The
meeting was led by L. M. Currie. The
Scripture reading was taken from Ga-
lations 6:1-10. The subject suggested
by the reading was “Young Christians
Looking Forward.” In the discussion
that followed the idea was brought out
that young Christians must press on and
aspire to greater things, forgetting what
is behind them, and looking forward that
they may grow in grace and knowledge.

The officers elected for the spring
term are. E. G. Lilly, President; G. W.
Brown, Vice-President. and J. E. Cas-
sell, Secretary and Treasurer.

least three weeks’ supply in the college
bins. It has been decided to discontinue
the heating of the gymnasium, as this is
not absolutely necessary.

The outlook for the town is not so
bright. There is very little coal in the
vards and a great many unfilled orders
on the books, Coal is being sold only in
half-ton lots and less, as there is no cer-
tainty as to when the next shipment will
reach here. The townspeople are urged
to use the uttermost economy in burning
their coal, and to co-operate with the
‘ocal dealers in every possible way.
