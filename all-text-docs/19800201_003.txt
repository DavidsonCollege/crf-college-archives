Bohemians once flourished and flavored campus life at Davidson

What has happened to the
Davidson bohemian? Who and
what was he? Where did he go?

The concept of the bohemian
student is elusive and hard to
define. One reliable source said
the label ‘‘bohemian’’ neces-
sarily implies such perverse
characteristics as alcohol abuse,
weird ideas about sex, and other
anti-social personal traits. He
said that this, of course, would
make it a great insult to call
anyone ‘‘bohemian’’ (though
some may have relished the
label anyway) and that David-
son had never really had any.

The Great God Webster, on
the other hand, identifies the
bohemian merely as ‘‘a follower
of art, literature, or similar
pursuits who adopts an indivi-
dualistic, easygoing, and some-
times eccentric way of living
that reflects protest against or
indifference to social conven-

tions.”

It always seemed to me, on
still another hand, that bohemi-
ans were just folks who shared a
few specialized character-
istics—an aversion to bright
colors and man-made fibers,
an attraction to folk music, and
a penchant for the esoteric and
the obscure. They also would
not be bent by the pressure of
fads and trends.

It seemed, finally, that ‘‘bo-
hemian’’ had become one of
those English department
words that everybody has ideas
about but nobody has a con-
crete definition for however, by
delving into the past it was
possible to discover several
names that repeatedly brought
nods of agreement from faculty
and students when used in
connection with the word bohe-
mian.

Bill Barnes '78 appeared to
be a prime specimen. He hailed
from London and had travelled
all over Europe, visiting many

owe

obscure towns. He would fre-
quently write poetry set in tiny
Italian villages peopled with
men whose ‘‘bald heads splat-
tered on sidewalks.’’ He sported
an army jacket and ‘backpack
before they were fashionable
and jingled more bracelets than
Merilyn Graham. The intelectu-
al aspect of bohemianism was
also well represented in Barnes,
for under his long blond hair
and beard lay a vast knowledge
of Latin and English literature.
And he was notorious for the
ability to consume huge quanti-
ties of beer on Thursday night
and still be able to argue about
Shakespeare’s nature imagery
with Mr. Lloyd at 8:00 Friday
morning.

The bohemian crowd could
usually be found swimming in
the water tower or, more pro-
saically, in the Union. One
senior remembers seeing them
every morning at ten, smoking
high-tar cigarettes, drinking
coffee that looked like crude oil,
and discussing the sublime in
disinterested monotones.

A bohemian. activity which
received a fair amount of publi-
city last spring was the ‘‘one
garment’’ party held at the
Booty Palace, the home of a
disproportionate number of
campus bohemians. The party
was memorialized in last year’s
Quips & Cranks by several
pictures of the blanket clad
students carousing on the
Booty Palace roof. One of the

“~---~-revelers was Mark Tyndall.

Tyndall displayed several in-
teresting, if not enviable char-
acteristics, primary among
which was the ability to main-
tain a three day growth of beard
at all times..A union employee
told me that Tyndall’s elbow
marks are still to be found in
snack bar tabletops.

Tony Snow was another bo-
hemian character worth a men-
tion. Also a recent graduate,
Snow, a philosophy major, was
reportedly a tongue in cheek

Bill Barnes lounges abroad.

satirist who challenged the
status quo, but showed it some
respect. He and a few cohorts
planned a satirical magazine
called the Colostomy (look it
up) which never quite made it
into print—a typical bohemian
endeavor.

Then there was the guy who
lived in the tree. Actually there
were several who spent time in
the tree house-behind Ridge
Road, but the main inhabitant
was its builder, Brian Jacobs,
who is now keeping busy pro-
testing nuclear power.

Digging to the roots of
Davidson bohemianism yeilded
one of the “original long hairs”
who, carved the wayt for the
wool and cotton crowd and free
verse poets of more recent
years. This true giant of proto-
bohemianism- was Gordon Ball.
He began his Davidson career
as chairman of the fine films
committee, a post which he
used to feed his interest in
underground movies.

Ball managed to get Jonas
Mekos, a leader in the under-

ground film movement, to visit

the campus. As a results, Ball
went to work for Mekos after

graduation. From there he went
on to for close relationships
with those bastions of revolu-
tionary art forms, Andy Warhol
and Allen Ginsberg. He helped
to run Warhol’s goat farm and
wrote a well-known book on
Ginsberg, Allen Verbatim. The
jacket blurb defines Ball as a
filmmaker, photographer, poet,
handyman, and farmer, which
together make for a rather well
rounded bohemian. He was last
seen under a tree in Chapel Hill
reading poetry to anyone who
would listen.

So there are a few of them:
some of the exponents of one of
Davidson’s most extreme ex-
tremes. But where are they
now, these upholders of tradi-
tion (granted, it is only their
own tradition they're uphold-
ing), these leaders of anti-
trends, these bastions of origin-
ality? The air in the Union
stagnates as we wait to hear a

muttered line of obscure poetry

or the clink of a bracelet or two.
return, O beacons of shattered
and neglected lifestyle. We
falter without your inspired,
dissipated, iconoclasitc leader-
ship. Return, return!
