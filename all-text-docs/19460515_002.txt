eMy-Ginal“30'

As the final issue of the Davidsonian
for this semester goes to press, my mind
struggles to search for those little bits
of material which should go to make up
this article. All week | have wished that
final editorials could be skipped. And now,
reading proof and checking copy for the
last time, yelling a tinal order, and watch-
ing, late on a’ Thursday night as one by
one the present staff bangs’ the - office
door for the last time, any sort of objective
appraisal of the’ paper-that-has-been be-
comes almost impossible.

I_ wish that this entire colum could be an
open letter of thanks to the swellest staff
any editor ever had the privilege of working
with. They’ve known their jobs and they’ve
done them well and willingly, and they’ve been
very wonderful people, which is the simplest—
and most unoriginal way—I can say the best
thing that can be said about a staff.

All of us have made mistakes; in spite of
everything théte have been inaccuracies
_ and missed stories and ‘too many ads for
all the news. We've lost a little sleep, but 1
think we have received something invalu-
able this year, for the Davidsonian of fice,
as THE DAVIDSONIAN, has been a
place that encourages freedom of thought
and expression; and as we have argued
and raced on wastebaskets—and put a
newspaper to bed—we have talked of free-
dont and responsibility. and democracy and
we have believed in these things, and we
hope that thesé beliefs have been present
in Our paper.

We have believed that “liberty of thought
is the life of the soul,” and that the chief job
of a campus newspaper is to provide a medi-
um for expression of that thought. We have
believed that “freedom of the press is the
staff of life for any vital democracy,” and we
have tried to interpret, reflect, and stimulate
student opinion—opinion not necessarily that
of the editor or the staff, but-opinion that we
do not have the right to suppress. This, it
seems to me, is the highest purpose of a news-
paper, and a purpose which a college paper,
free from political or commercial coercion, ‘is
perculiarly fitted to realize.

Let’s turn Father Time back a few mo-
ments and recall a few of the things that

have made this school year a success. The’

freshmen. were officially welcomed into

Graduation is just around the corner,
and to our graduates we bid farewell, as
we look to them for leadership upon their
entrance into the threshold of the world,

Now is the time for us to turn our tho-
ughts to the opening of school in the fall.
Many new faces will. be seen on the cam-
pus, as eight hundred students assemble
here then. This will create many problems
and obstales which must be overcome.

To our newly elected student body of-
ficers we offer hearty congratulations, en-
sured that they will do a good job in carry-
ing on where their predecessors left off.
To our retiring officers, we thank them for
what they have done, conscious of the sit-
uations they have been through, and for
them pledging our loyalty to the new men
in office.

Yo the new staff, whoever they may be,
we extend best wishes. And to Editor Sut-
ton, we look for a bigger and better Da-

At the present tme, from my point

Dear Editor:
Why is there no provision for a
new musi¢ buildng in the proposed

are and have been actively associat-
ed with the Davidson Music De-

need for more adequate | facilities.

active appreciation of music along

As for the inadequacy of the pre-

are not enough practice rooms, and
those which we have are undesir-
able. Recently, due to the need for
space, a piano has been placed in
the latrine! The “airs” that eminate
therefrom are none too pelasing.

We are not advocating that Da-

Things I Hate!!!~

By McDOWELL TATE

Definite action on the matter of
gars on the campus witheut per-
mission finally came down this past
week in the form of a letter from
the Dean of Students office: It was
very clear and concise, making it
plain that though so far this year;
little or nothing has been done to-
ward enforceing this rule, from now
are forbidden and offenders
will be punished,

Tam of the opinion that the rule

prohibiting stiidents from haying

ears here at Davidson for general

use has been somewhat outmoded

durtig the course of the war. Be-
fore the war, the average age of the
younger
than it is now or will be this next
fall. Considering that at that time
most of the students were well un-

student-body was much

der twenty years old, some justi-
ficatton may be seen in the faculty
rule that Davidson Students were
too imature to have a car here.
This year, however, I hardly think
that the faculty can consider those
who have returned from the army
quite so immature_as student-bodies

of years gone by. A large majority
of the returnees are well over the
so-called legal mature age of twenty
-one, and it is with these men in
mind that I advocate the rule about
cars be relaxed somewhat.

A resolution that would be more
in keeping with the times would al-

lege of ‘cars as well as those stu-
dents who are over twefity-one and
who have their parents permission,

added that the privilege may be re-
voked at any time when a student

is placed. on probation.

Of course so far as this year is
concerned, it is too near the end to
expect any changes to take place.
This column is written with an eye
to next fall when the student-body
will contain in all probability a ma-
jority of older men, men who will
certainly -be mature enough to use
a certaan amount of discreation if
they may have their cars here at
Davidlson. I hope that the faculty
may sce fit to relax this rather dis-
tasteful rule sometime bef6re next
September.

Now that things around the cam-
pus are returning to normal, another
tradition, droped during the war, is
being revived. The Seniors are look-
