Union investigation confirms

900 Room funding defecit

An audit of college union
financial records has verified
the earlier reported overspend-
ing by several union commit-
tees, according to Union Fin-
ance Committee Chairman
Brad Swalwell.

The audit, which has been
underway since the over-
spending was first reported to
the Union Board on January
22, shows three committees
have spent more than their
allotted budgets.

‘‘The 900 Room and the
Social Vice President’s con-
tingency budget are the deep-
est in the red,”’ said Swalwell.

The 900 Room is $690 over-
spent and the contingency
fund for Union Vice President
Robert M. Mayer is $320 over.

Swalwell said that his com-
mittee is charged with audi-
ting the financial records and
with presenting recommenda-
tions on how to improve the
record-keeping system.

Swalwell indicated that, al-
though the entire committee

had not met to-discuss: recom:--

mended changes in the sys-
tem, ht ‘had some ideas for
improveménts in mind. ~~ ;
“First of all, there need to

be controls placed’én When a ™

committee can overspend its
budget. To place a committee
under a budget, only to have it
violated virtually at will, is no
better than operating without
a budget:

“Somebody, either the pres-
ident, one of the two vice
presidents, the director, or
even the full board, should
have to approve any over-
spending by any committee,”
said Swalwell.

Swalwell added that the
controls must be placed so
that they are effective during
the planning stages of union
activities, before any obliga-
tions are incurred through
contracts.

As an example, Swalwell
noted that the 900 Room has
contracted for $1300 worth of
acts to be given during Spring
term. ‘‘This is an obligation
now; it is spent, just as if a
check had been written for it,”’
he said.

Swalwell also said he saw
problems with the method

which the Union Board uses to
allocate funds to the various
committees. ‘‘Several commit-
tees appear to have been allo-
cated either much more or
much less than they need.

‘*For instance, the arts
and crafts committee was
given $1000 in September; as
of February 29, they have not
spent any of it. The dance
committee was allocated $2000
—they have spent less than
$70.

“Then there is the 900
Room, running almost $700
over, not counting their
spring bookings. The apart-
ment that the Union keeps for
entertainers wasn’t even con-

 SWALWELL
sidered whén the budget was

~ made. That’s $2000 a year.

“Something is wrong some-
where. The board needs to
scrutinize budget requests
thoroughly. They must come
up with a better way of eval-
uating their committee’s
needs, and allocate according-
ly,”’ said Swalwell.

Swalwell elaborated on the
committees which were over-
spent. ‘“‘The 900 Room is not
in as bad a shape as was first
reported,’’ he said. ‘‘The Jan-
uary 22 report to the Union
Board puts the 900 Room
running almost a $2500 defi-
cit.

‘‘Several old receipts for
money deposited with the
Comptroller’s Office turned
up. This money was only
recently credited to the re-
cords,” said Swalwell.

“That, comvined with
money received recently as
admissions charges to the 900
Room have reduced the deficit
‘to its present level,”’ he said.

‘The third committee with a
negative balance is the Outing
Club. “Karl Goodhouse (Un-.
ion President) has assured me
that this situation has been
remedied, however,’’ said
Swalwell.

Swalwell emphasized that
the College Union as a whole is
not overspending. ‘‘What has
happened is that several
groups have spent more than
the Board said they could
spend. The fact that many
other committees have spent
way under their allowances
puts the Union as a whole in
the black,” he said.

Swalwell added that the
figures presented to Good-

house were not completely

final.

The Union’s figures on
money deposited in the Comp-
troller’s Office agree with the
Comptroller’s records.

“What remains to be done is
matching what the Union says
it has paid out with what the
Comptroller’s Office says they
have paid out,” said Swalwell.

“This is a lorig and tedious
proce$s. I’lk have to go
thréugh both sets of books
and match up all the debits.
Also, I have to check and see
that all the expenses are
charged against the proper
committee,’’ he said.

Spencer criticizes Davidsonian

A. Clayton Spencer, a junior at Williams College and
daughter of Davidson College President Samuel R.
Spencer, Jr. has criticized the Davidsonian for its
coverage of the college’s abandonment of the practice of

paying hall counselors.

In a front page story in the Williams Record, Miss
Spencer charged that The Davidsonian blew out of
proportion a statement by Dean of Students Will H.
Terry on the end of hall counselgr pay.

The Record erroneously.attributed to Terry the
statement, ‘‘I found out that Williams College...did not
pay its junior advisors. I said, ‘by golly, if they can do it

why can’t we?’.”’

The statement was in fact made by Dr. Spencer.

Miss Spencer told The Record that her father had asked
her if William’s junior advisors were paid, but said that
other issues were the major factors in his decision to cut

out hall counselor pay.

Miss Spencer is quoted in The Record as saying,
“Williams was not that great an influence. It was used as
a rationalization, an example.”

Job market bleak

The College Placement Council in Bethlehem, Pennsy]-
vania has released the results of a survey which shows a
bleak job market for college graduates.

The survey showed that the number of job offers for
people with bachelors’ degrees is down 16 percent from
March a year ago. The number of offers for this year’s
graduates is less than last year, which itself was a bad

year to find a job.

The areas hardest hit, according to the survey, are jobs
for people with degrees in the humanities and social
sciences. Job offers in these two areas dropped 26 per cent.

seniors to build classroom

By ANDREW LAMAS
Senior News Editor

Solicitation of funds from
seniors for their class gift, an
outdoor classroom, began Fri-
day, March 19.

‘‘Members of the Senior
Class Gift Committee will be
around to see each person in

the class by Sunday March 28.

“‘We are asking for at least

$15 from each member of the
senior class. This has been the
amount asked of seniors in the
past three or four years,’’
explained a spokesman for the
Senior Class Gift Committee.

The outdoor classroom,
which is to be located in the
wooded area behind the Mar-
tin Chemistry Building, will
be circular and thirty feet in
diameter.

76 SENIOR GIFT: A partial view of
the planned outdoor classroom.

The classroom will rest on a
brick and sand: base and will
contain five fixed tables and
eleven benches, providing for
a seating capacity of thirty-
three people. j

“In the center of the class-
room will be an open space,
fifteen feet in diameter, which
will readily lend itself to small
dramatic performances and
oral presentations.

“In addition, the classroom
could be used for outdoor
study, small informal lectures
and class discussions, pro-
viding an alternative to the

indoor classroom,’’
commented the committee
spokesman.

“Our financial goal is $2300
to $2500. And, if everything
proceeds as planned, we would
like to see the classroom built
by the end of Spring term,’’
remarked the spokesman.

In a preference poll among
seniors for the class gift, the
outdoor classroom received
the most votes.

Other suggestions on the
ballot were a microfilm prin-
ter, a community housing
project, a gift fund for college
staff members, and the fram-
ing of a portion of the college’s
art collection.

The ten members of the Gift
Committee are: Martin Eakes,
Dave Francis, Dave May-
berry, Don Benson, Bobby
Mendenhall, Rick Roylance,
Cosby Swanson, John Taylor,
Hadley Wilson, and Bill Reed.
