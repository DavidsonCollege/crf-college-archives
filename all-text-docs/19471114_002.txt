It chas-been said that all history
be written in the lives of a few men.
men were the thinkers, It is through
men that civilization and progress have come.
Some one once asked Carlyle the population
Europe, to which he answered, ‘Forty
niillion, mostly fools.”’ Now Carlyle meant
that most of these men did not think.

Are college men of today to be numbeged,
among. Carlyle’s imillions are they to
emerge from formal education, having ae-
complished the highest purpose of educa
tion? The world is in great need of thought,
while millions upon millions of dollars are
spent yearly as men and women pass time
in educational institutions ‘getting by.’” To
wreat masses of youth, colleges are ends in
themselves, not the means to the end of @
ereater intellect and an ability to solve the
ever present problems of effecting a better
society and a greater progress.

Most students ‘get. by:’’ they attend
classes, they memorize key words, and
phrases, they gzive back to the professor his

of

or

awn words and thoughts, they accept asser-
tions as facts, and in the face of problems
and controversy, they allow passion to_re-
place reason, The previous sentence is a hard
one: let us temper it with ‘they have a
tendency to—.’? Yet, where do tendencies
lead one, They lead to consummation!
The wreat need today, and in all #imes, is

for thinkers. Every man on a college campus
should try to aequire an ‘ability to think
straight and with conviction, To accomplish
such every man must put away from him his
erandfather’s prejudices as he has put away
his outmoded vadgets and implements. He
must gather to himself tolerance and justice.
He must choose with great care the thought
will follow, in of

he absence

a personal
knowledge and conviction, And, lastly, he
must Hserhninate between the true and
false. Let college men not cling too much to
the past, nor plunge too blindly into the
future, but ‘‘prove all things, hold fast to

Letters to the

Editor

Dear Editor:

The points presented in Malloy Owen's
column in last week’s Davidsonian concern-
ing the need of two extra days for Thanks-
giving are excellent, Thanksgiving, is one of
the few times during the year that family
circles in which college students are members
are complete. As it stands now, with only one
day for Thanksgiving, only those’students
who live within a radius of sixty or seventy
miles are able to go home. The students of
Davidson, as students of a Christian College
and students from Christian. homes, deserve
the opportunity of spending this, one of the
most cherished Christian holidays, with their
families. :

We sincerely hope that the students will

“support Malloy Owens and that the faculty

will see fit to grant us an extension of our
Thanksgiving holiday.

To the Editor.

Confusion and uneertainty seem to domi-
nate onr world today. No one knows just
what will happen next. At any moment Rus-

sian planes might fly over anid drop atomic
bombs on New York, Chicago, San) Fran-
cisco, Little Rock and our other inajor cities.
We do not know whether Russia pate
wants peace, or is simply stalling off Americ:

are just as urgent and disturbing,
Politically the world is. in an almost ir-
reparable mess, Communism is winning out
in much of E urope, but recently the rightists
have been having some success, especially in
Western Europe, Because the people are re-
duced to utter poverty and imisery, they
think that anything would be better than
what they have, They, therefore, follow the
party which makes the biggest promises of
restoration. Communism won this battle at
first, until the people of Western Europe saw
the results of choosing it, and now they are
drifting to a more conservative government.

_But suffering poverty, privation, and want_

still prevail, and as long as they do, the fu-
ture of Europe will be very uncertain and

confused,

America is not as safe from this wide-
spread infection as some extreme optimists
are prone to believe. She is in the midst of
un inflation worse than any She has ever be-
fore experienced, Inflation grows in one con-
tinuous spiral upward, but when it reaches
its limit, the bottom drops out with no warn-
ing. Men will not have time to rescue their
wealth. They will go to sleep rich and well-
to-do and will wake up paupers. It is the
youth of our age thatowil have to bear the
brunt of this inevitable collapse. Also many
social problems prevail: the race question,
for instance, The disputes between labor and
Inanagement are still very mich a problem,
With these dilemmas and the dread of war
Americans do not know what to expect next.

Morally America, as well rest of
the World, has from Worse,
Civilization, as it exists today, seems to make
the world instead of better, As the
vears go'by a larger and larger percentage
of Amricans die drunkard’s death, The
divorce rate has gone from one divoree out of

us the
vone bad to
worse

a

of évery six marriages in the 1930s to one
divorcee out of every three marriages in
1946. Juvenile delinquency has become a

major concern facing the Hederal Bareau of
luvestigation, The interest in Christianity
has decreased markedly since the end of the
war. Whe the United Nations Charter was
drawn up, the United States was entered as
a pagan nation, Money has become the god
of a large percentage of Americans. In
Kurope the moral problem is even worse.
Some of the fagnilies who were. respected
and looked up telore the war now make a
meager living by sending their own daugh-
ters out as prostitutes. Nine-tenths of the
population of the war-torn nations are forced
to steal whatever they can get their hands
on for life’s preservation. Women, and even

children, steal and smuggle for a living.

Europe cannot afford the luxury of integrity ;
therefore, integrity hardly exists there any

more. Morals must be improved before, they
are completely forgotten,

Such facts as these would naturally lead
to pessimism. It would seem that there is
no hope for the world, But there is one hope
left; one faint, glow illuminating the path
to peace and prosperity, This light, of course,
Christianity. Christianity, if universally
and sincerely accepted, will not only lead to
complete inner happiness on this earth, but
also in the tifeto come, The highway of sin,
Which the world taken today, has led
to dire misery and suffering, but Christianity
will solve all thes. orld’s problems by; uproot-
ing the evils that exist today and replacing
them with world brotherhood, unselfishness.
mility. love, and a deep faith in the di-
Vinewpowers of Christ. But why this not
done? Why does -not-someone do something
about it? Because the ones who are capable of
doing something about it are leaving it up
to the other fellow, **Why should I do it?
The other fellow can do it just as well and
probably better,” they say.

Now we have the problems and we also
have the solution, but-what are we—-not the
other fellow—but what are we going to do
about it? Suppose all the students of David-
son College, nearly a thousand morally, men-
tally and spiritually strong voung men, in-

vaded the world with the cross as their ban-

ner and the Bible as their sword, The good
they could do would be beyond belief. Christ
leaves this challenge with the students of
Davidson College and’ the youth of today.
We have the problems and we have the solu-
tions; now the Christ, who unselfishly gave
his life to save us all, dares us to do some-
thing about it. “

he watched the waiter mash and
press upon the ground steak until
he could stand it no longer. In a
very loud voice he startled the en-
