Our Blessings

Thanksgiving this year giyes all Ameri-
cans an execilent opportunity to view their
Situazion and be truly thankiul, But while -
many ot us have said this in the past. and
will again say it this vear, just how mane
will stop to consider thoughttully faust how |!
fortunate we are?

We at Davidson hicve blessings almnsi
unnumbered. We live in a tree country. We
think a> we please, meet when and where
we please. say what we please, and it we |
donit ike something someone does can look
him in the eye and tell him inst where to
get otf. Our nights are not ulled with the
drone of bombers, nor- our days with the +
thunder of marching fect. Our hospitals are |
tilled with people, but not because of high
powered explosives which tnaim and kali

’
ee

deparuments do rush forth to battle tiames,
‘beat they are uot the product of. incendiary .
bombs. Our newspapers do not carry the |
daily casuafty lists. Hor these things we ean
he thankful.

Hut we at Davidson have even more things
to be thankrul tor. even though we do take |
mosi of them ior granted. Our opportunities
are multitucinous. Through no work of our
own, in most-cases, we have received the
greatest advantages which can be made pos-
sible for young men.

Here we are able to reccive an edueation
equal to any ofiered by a coliege with simi-
lar aims and purposes. Our student bady is
of the highest type, and it is indeed a privi-
tege to live for Cour vears in close contaet
with such a group. Notwithstanding the con-
tinuous “griping” which seems to be char-
acteristie of homo Sapiens. mest students
will agree that the numerous advantages of
the college outweigh easily the faults whieh
must be present with any earthly thing. And ~
yet what have we done to deserve these
things? Why shduld not some less fortu-
nate young men have taken our piace here,
while we slaved away at some tiresome and

a

a

monotonous job? What special virtue have

—we which entitled us to become the recipi-

cents, of so many enviable opportnumnities ?

Are we essentially “better” than the thou-

sands of other youths throupinoui the coun-
try who never went to college? Or were we
just lucky in that our parents were able 9
give us these advantages?

Sometimes it would pay to think about
these things. Perhaps ‘by this we could
realize the moral responsibility placed on
us along with thd advantages. And in the
meanwhile, we do have much to be thaiik-
ul for. Maybe too much for the best.

ON THE ANTICS OF
STUDENT SALESMEN:

There are a great many students
on the campus who represent cloth-
ing houses, shoe concerns, cigarette
manufacturers, and various other
trecchantile firms. There are also
a yxoodly number who have begun
private retail enterprises.

These are the men who; in ply-
ing their trades. plaster trees and
bulletin ‘boards with various en-
treaties and grand announcements.

These vendors use many and vari-
ed appraaches in disposing of their
goods. Let us consider first the
quasi-psychological .or—hearty, —ef-
fusive-approach in which the sales-
man begins the assault by attempt-
ing to caiole his subject into a good
humor.

He_breezes_into one's room with

“Xmas in July’ ‘Dick Powell and

The story of “Nmas in July” is
pretty fantastic—all about the ad-

ventures of a young couple who
set_out.to spend $25,000 which they
think they have won in a slogan
contest, only to learn that their
celebration is a bit—oh, quite—pre-
mature. Dick's and Ellen's perform-
ances, Sturges’ direction, and clever
high-lights, such as the antics of the
slogan contest’ jury and the satine
on slogan contests in general, add
up yo excellent entertainment.

Next there is the type that uses
satire .or sarcasm in order to put
his product across. He ambles rath-
er than breezes in, takes a leisure-

for instance? your shoes, and re-
marks: “Where'd you get those bar-

Again, there is the casual: off-
hand salesman who saunters in, bor-
rows a smoke, and conversationally
puts forward his product. Probably
he is in the business for the fel-
lowship or for the heck of wt for

tobe. high.

Free advertising _is_ available . ta
such salestnen in the form of chapel
aunouncements. They compose: nov-
el and witty edicts and have certain
accomplices to start the booing when —
the commercial touch becomes evi-
dent. The greater the volume of
boos, the more his wares come be-
fore the public eye.

A very interesting situation arises
when salesman meets salesman in
the- process of-a dormitory can-
vass. Proposal is met by counter-
Proposal, and generally the situa-
tion terminates in a deadlock.

Freshmen are without doubt the
class that these salesmen prefer to, |
work on, they being as a rule the
most gullible and willing. | They
are usually push-overs for novelties
especially, such as pennants, . pla-
ques, etc. Within them the patriotic
fire waxes eloquent.

In most cases the monetary gain ~
of these student salesmen is not
great, but they are recompensed by
the wealth of experience that their
various’ receptions afford. ’
