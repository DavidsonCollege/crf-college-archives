Greek Week

Davidson’s fraternities can be com-
mended at least on a superficial level
for the changes which have developed
in the venerable old “Joe College” tra-
dition of Greek Week.

Human decency should not be a
trait that has to be commended. ‘but
in the context of immaturity it seems
that the transformation of what was
“Hell Week” only a few years ago into
the positive non-hazing Greek Week is
a noticeable improvement. Civilization,
has still not occurred. Ask any pledge
who has crawled through his house
on hands and knees, counted railroad
ties, or collected assorted panties and
bras during the past week.

At least positive superficialities have
come about. At least now the empha-
sis is on coming to brotherhood by
way of discussion of fraternity or col-
lege problems, or through service pro-
jects. (By the way, pledge, you had
better get your fill of these while you
can. Except for the annual aims-giving.
at Christmas and “building charac-
ter through service” for next year’s
pledges during Greek Week, this is
probably the only time your fraternity
as a whole will act for others. No,
maybe that is not true. You never can
tell when it will need to kowtow to the
college to gain favor.)

The basic improvement needed is
not in the conduct of Greek Week, but
in the concept of that institution. Why
is building pledge class unity such a
big deal? Why is it so necessary to in-
still a reverence for the founders of
the fraternity? Why is it necessary to
build loyalty to the fraternity as some-
thing apart from the students of whom

Overseer Wanted

Three poets in one day should be
quite a stimulating experience next
week. With a little bit of luck and
even fewer obligations, perhaps some-
one will be fortunate enough to hear
and meet with the whole trio. On the
other hand, the college might engage
in some psychedelia by having all
three stand in different corners of the
Morrison Room in the College Union,
turn on that mad overhead rotating
light, and produce a paint-in.

The coming extravaganza points up
the lack of coordination in scheduling
or arranging to have such events. The-
oretically, the Union is supposed to be
watching the scheduling of events, but
about all the Union can do in the mat-
ter at the present time is just make
certain that two or more activities do
not find themselves batting around in
the same room at the same time.

it is composed? Does the enjoyment of
the company of close friends need to
be reinforced by “mystic goodies”?

Fraternities are justifiable at David-

son for two reasons. One, people enjoy
being in close association with some
people more than with others. Sec-
ondly, fraternities are a convenient
and, ideally, harmless way to meet the
social needs of the students. It is easi-
er to organize social activities through
a fraternity than it is among another
‘group of students who may be scat-
tered all across the campus. Social
functions organized on the basis of
dormitory halls would be just as con-
venient, but they might not be as sat-
isfying in any meaningful way. The
two justifications for fraternities are
interdependent.

The loyalty to a particular frater-
nity on the basis of its creed or writ-
ten ideals is naive. Differences in mor-
alistic tone can be perceived among
the fraternities. However, the preser-
vation of any such tone is entirely de-
pendent upon the membership at a
given time, ‘not upon some symbolism
everlastingly engraved upon the heart
or branded on the rear with a paddle.

The functions of Greek Week seem
to be to introduce an artificial inten-
sity into what could be quite natural
relationships of concern among ma-
ture men and to instill loyalty to an
institution which is falsely deemed to
be the preserver of all that is right in
the world. Greek Week itself then is
no better than forced “love” or wor-
shipping an institution or compulsory
vespers.

Even more important than the sched-
uling problem (Wouldn’t it be nice to
have so much going on that conflicts
could not be avoided?), more impor-
tant than allotment of rooms, is the
need for some agency to be on the
lookout for prominent men who might
be scheduled to appear at Davidson
and other places in the near area. Ac-
ademic departments through the Pied-
mont University Center and the Social
Council with its. block-booking confer-
ences are making use of this idea. Not
only does it save them money, but it
also means that they can attract more
important figures.

A centralized. office on campus to
bring resources from outside the col-
lege would necessarily be sympathetic
to requests from within the campus
for certain events, as well as being
able to draw upon regular correspond-
ence with other schools.

Cloak And Dagger Stuff

Sub-committee reports for the Blue
Sky Committee have been kicking
their way around in the various mys-
tic crannies of wherever somebody
puts whatever it is.

Everybody has heard the rumors
that some dean at Princeton has said
that the one thing holding Davidson
back is the lack of a nocturnal subway
between DC land and Queens. And
most know of that one about how some
small school out in the boondocks that
is really setting the pace in education
has said that the key to its success is
the absence of a faculty and adminis-
tration.

But of course the really exciting
part of the whole deal is that the Blue
Sky sub-committee on something or
another has recommended that the
whole student body be ferried to New
York every other weekend to pick up
the cultural offerings in metropolia
which would complement the present
ethnic beauties of Carolina. This does
not even begin to consider the excit-
ing proposal by the joint sub-sub-com-
mittee or something like that urging
that compulsory ROTC be replaced by
compulsory Peace Corps.

Then someday in the future, like
next September, the whole set of pro-
posals in an organic form will be
opened for the students’ perusa?. The
natural tendency would be to have
them read over the loudspeaker on
too of Chambers Building. But per-
hans each student should be given wal-
let-sized rpelicas of the great stones
on which they will be written. But
please note that they will be only writ-
ten in chalk, not yet engraved. The
guidelines for the Blue Sky committee
do state that they will be presented
then for the consideration of interest-
ed students presumably so that alter-
natives could be proposed by them at
least informally to committee mem-

bers. Of course, the schedule does call
for the entire proposed curriculum re-
vision to be formally presented to the
faculty at the first faculty meeting of
next October. This means that any
changes will have to be acted on with-
in about a month if the powers that
be are willing to consider changing
THE PLAN to incorporate sugges-
jons.

_ Even if there is confusion concern-
ing the various ideas that may or may
not be under consideration, few stu-
dents would maintain in their sober
moments that the Blue Sky Committee
desires any less than what it consid-
ers to be the very best for the school.
Nor does anyone really believe that
the committee gets a kick out of being
secretive just to enjoy playing a sort
of divine mystery role.

The open meeting that was held on
the proposal of the Sub-Committee on
Non-Western Studies and on the con-
cept of an Honors College supports
this willingness to be frank on some
things by the Blue Sky Committee.
The hang-up comes in the fact that
the committee is insisting on secrecy
on most matters. Students on sub-com-
mittees are not bound to blood-signed
oaths of secrecy on the information
they have collected from other institu-
tions. However, they are not supposed
to reveal the proposals made by their
groups.

An understanding of the complicat-
ed portions of the entire Blue Sky re-
port is desirable for the students. It
could on occasion facilitate faculty
passage if solid student support were
secured for the report. The secrecy
with which sub-committee reports is
being handled does seem to be incon-
sistent with the ideal of encouraging a
more organic role for students within
the college.

Student Council Seeks ‘Energetic’ Image

The

Renovation and assertion are
the words that may unlock a
new future for the Davidson
Student Council and the whole
position of student government
on the Davidson campus.

Acutely conscious of the
complaints about the lacka-
daisical, ‘‘do-nothing’’ attitude
of past Student Councils, the
present council is trying to
project a new, more energetic
image to the student body.

“But let's begin at the be-
ginning.” says Tom Earn-
hardt, leader of this new
movement and the new presi-
dent of the council. And so.
presto! The old storage room
on the second floor of the Un-
ion, previously known as the
office of the Student Body
President. will soon become
the office of the Student Coun-
cil, with a rug. a telephone.
curtains, paintings. and regu-
lar office hours.

stitution. Such a revision may

certain ancient elements of
the constitution which have

Already the Student Council
has begun to move into other
new areas by sponsoring two
projects initiated by Earn-
hardt, the Student Recruiting
Program and the Educational
Planning Program. Both pro-
jects are trying to spread in-
formation about Davidson to
areas relatively unfamiliar
with it and to arouse a previ-
ously untapped source of in-
terest in Davidson College.

ED. NOTE: This cotumn,
which will appear regularly,
is written by students who
will not return to Davidson
next year, in order to allow
them to express their opin-
ions on the college.

By DAN MOMBREA

There are things happening
on this campus. It’s impossible
to ignore that fact. Not as
quickly as they should may-
be, and certainly with too
many people still not caring,
but they are happening. The
student body, even if only in
small groups, is taking mat-
ters in their own hands and
doing.

The students on the Blue
Sky Committee are talking
about the lack of time and
their fear that not enough will
be changed. The newspaper
staff wants to get on with the
job of producing what was this
year (for the first time in re-
cent years) a real newspaper.
The College Union can't wait
until next year, neither can
the students working for the
Hungry d or the Union Coffee
House. Even among the stu-
dent body itself there is talk
of ‘‘next year.’

AMAZING YEAR

As far as this year goes, one
can only be amazed at what
happened. The Social Commit-
tee brought in, not just good
entertainment, but really great
entertainment. The students
who form what might be con-
sidered “Davidson's art cir-
cle’ held everything from
their own shows of paintings
to poetry readings to sing-ins.

Students went to peace
marches, walked in labor lines,
started a truly significant civ-
il rights organization, held fo-
rums on everything from sub-
sidized athletics to alcohol on
campus to the ideas behind
being a conscientious objector.
Chapel speakers at least once
in awhile deviated from the
administration-spawned small-
time Presbyterian minister

and or theologian syndrome
that makes chapel such a de-
light. The president of the stu-
dent body went on record as
against the war in Vietnam.

On another level students
finally broke down the one
hundred-year-old color barrier
that existed as a truly ugly
spot in our fraternity system
and for the student body it-
self The only comment I can
make on the latter accomplish-
ment is to say that the do after
the papers carried the story
about the fraternity pledging
a Negro was with one brother
who was making a long-dis-
tance phone call. When he told
the operator she would have
to charge it to that house the
operator asked him ff he be-
longed to that fraternity house.
When he said yes she replied
with “Y'all did real good,”
then went on to make the call.

STRUGGLE

The most interesting opin-
fons I’ve heard this year about
the continuing struggle in all
ways between a student body
that is positively trying and
an administration that exists
to negate were made by a
member of the administra-
tion. another student, and a
member of the faculty. The
student said (admittedly a lit-
tle carried away) “Their time
has ceme™: the member of
the administration said ‘‘They
are really getting defensive,
almost paranoid, about the
changes that are taking
place"; and the member of the
faculty said “They (referring
to the administration) know
that the only way some things
are going to change is for a
real turn-over in personnel to
occur, and they have a very
real fear that they will be
among those missing when the
axe stops falling.”’

But if the students who have
read this and felt good about
the accomplishments I've cit-
ed, and if those who are glad
that things “are finally chang-
ing" would realize that every

Student Body's Potential

student counts, that they could
help if only by letting their
leaders in student government
and on the Blue Sky Commit-
tee know they are behind
them, then more could and
would be done.

This student body has more
raw talent than any other stu-
dent body I've been acquaint-
ed with. This isn’t my opinion,
it’s the opinion of people who
know education and know col-
lege campuses. Davidson Col-
lege deserves its reputation.
But its reputation has been
earned not “because of’’, but
*‘despite’’ an educationally-det-
rimental administrative desire
to preserve the status quo. It
fs the student body that has
built Davidson up, just as it
will be the student body that
will change this school to the
truly great small college it is.

ALL KINOS

It will take all kinds of men
to implement the changes that
will be recommended or cham-
pioned in the next few years.
That an atmosphere conducive
to change be fostered is one
of the most important of these.
The only way for this to hap-
pen is for more students to
make their opinion known in
some way.

Tf you want to see Davidson
become a better school. then
in some way begin to step
out. Write to THE DAVID.
SONIAN, go to the Blue Sky
Committee, talk to leaders in
student government. If each
of us in some way makes his
opinion known, he will first of
all give our student leaders
some basis for valid repre-
sentation of the student body,
and secondly let the adminis-
tration know that this student
body is behind the members
of the faculty and the stu-
dents who are honestly inter-
ested in making Davidson not
just an above-average institu-
tion, but a truly great one,
and are not afraid to change
it, or with it, to accomplish
that goal.

Model United Nations Assem-
bly.

At least this many and prob-
ably more will return to these
meetings next year, and one
or two delegates will probably
attend the National Student As-
sociation convention this sum-
mer, although Davidson is no
longer a member of this or-
ganization. Behind sending
such delegations is the hope
that they can pick up new
ideas about student govern-
ment by talking with people
from other schools.

One of the brightest hopes
for the immediate future is a
revived Student Exchange Pro-
gram, by which several stu-
dents could visit schools sim-
ilar to Davidson and examine
first hand the rules and inner
workings of those schools. In
turn, Davidson would entertain
students from these schools
and let them examine the way
things are conducted at David-
son.

In order to sponsor these
and several other new pro-
grams. the Student Council is
hoping to get a raise in its
budget. which is now less than
$1,000.

For the first time in its his-
tory, the Student Council is
meeting twice a week. AIl-

though this is intended to last
only until the end of the year,
it may continue next year if
the issues ‘are still numerous
and the interest is still pres
ent.

The new Student Council has
already approved two budding
organizations, the new Campus
Club and the Residence Hall
Association.

Bud Cousar has also assim-
jlated the proposals of various
platforms and made a list of
topics with which the Student
Council must deal in the com-
ing year.

Among these well-discussed
topics are exams before Christ-
mas; abolition of Saturday
classes: abolition of compul-
sory ROTC; an annual stu-
dent - organized, student - run
lecture-concert series; a new
book-store, expanded and sub-
sidized; abolition of the pres-
ent. drinking rule: elimination
of the cut system: and other
old favorites.

According to a new policy,
the council meetings will be
open this year to any inter-
ested students. Earnhardt or
some council member will be
in the Student Council office
every afternoon to discuss
problems or issues with any
students.

HUAC Strikes (Out) Again

Ted Winter, co-editor of The Miscellany, received

a press release the other day from one of Congress’
more humorous institutions, the House Committee on
Un-American Activities (HUAC). This is the committee,
you might recall, which last summer sponsored a hip-
pie-land circus, ringmastered by Rep. Joe Pool (D-Tex.),
the Joe Pyne of American politics.

The release is an expose of the “communist origin
and manipulation” of last Saturday’s peace demonstra-
tions in New York and San Francisco. I suppose it all
depends upon one’s definition of the words “origin”
and “manipulation” whether one accepts the accuracy
of the committee’s statements.

___ It is as easy for someone in the academic commun-
ity to attack HUAC as it is for a Congressman to attack
the evil communist conspiracy, but my intent is not to
present the constitutional and political arguments
against the committee’s existence. The committee is
probably factually correct in associating the recent
marches with people like Herbert and Bettina Apthek-
er, although there is nothing in the release to warrant

the statement that “communists are the principal (my
emphasis) organizing force’ behind these demonstra-

tions.

Also, the marches were boycotted by many Amer-

icans opposed to the Vietnam

Rather than attacking the committee per se, I hope

to indicate some of the

deficiencies of the press re-

the envelope (not to the editor of the literary maga-

should seem SO appropriate for a HUAC release indi-
cates how difficult it is for anyone to the left of James
Kilpatrick to take seriously most of what the commit-
tee Says. Even if the committee is accurate, its credi-
bility gap, at least as wide as the White House's, ob-
