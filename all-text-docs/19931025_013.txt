Moview Review

The Joy Luck Club drives everyone (but Scott) to tears

By Scott McLean

Hey fellow movie-goers! I
hope everyone had a great Fall
Break and perhaps used the oppor-
tunity to relax and see a good flick.
As for me I ventured into the the-
aters once again, expecting the
worst and ready for one on one
combat with yet another stinker--I
was prepared to enter the dragon
for the sake of Davidsonian read-
ers everywhere.

Ithought that TheAge ofInno-
cence had filled my good movie

quota for the semester and I would
be doomed :to see D-grade flicks
for the rest of the year. However,
Iwas pleasantly surprised and then
some with this week's fare, The
Joy Luck Club--when it rains, it
pours, I guess.

Adaptéd from the novel by
Amy Tan (she also co-wrote the
screenplay and shares producer
credit), this is the story of four
Chinese women who immigrated
to San Francisco and their daugh-
ters who were raised in America.

Although itsounds like a set-up for
a really sappy film, let me assure
you that it is 99% sap free. In fact,
I'm going to go out on a limb here
and say that it is one of the best
movies I have ever seen.

Here's the scenario: Aunties
Lindo, An-mei, Ying-Ying, and
Suyuan have gathered together
weekly for the past thirty years to
play mah-jongg andin the process,
have become entangled in each
other's lives and have shared their
stories of hardships in China.

When Suyuan passes away,
her daughter June (Ming-na Wen,
who gives a stellar performance in
her first big-screen role) is invited
to take her place at the game table.
It is here that she learns that her
two sisters who had been aban-
doned by her mother beside a road
in China have been located.

This begins a series of vi-
gnettes in which she recalls some
key moments in her life involving
her mother.

The stories of the aunties and
their daughters are told in like fash-
ion, examining the different kinds
of mother-daughter relationships
in the process.

This may sound rather bland,

butthe humor and compassion with

which these stories are told give
each one a spark and keep you

glued to the screen waiting to find
out what has happened in the lives
of these women. This movie is on
the long side (over two hours), but
I never looked at my watch once--
that's saying a lot for a film these
days.

It's a credit to Tan who has
managed to present what might
otherwise have been a rather con-
fusing story very clearly without
losing any of the feeling. Isay this
is definitely one worth checking
out--but one warning, though: it'sa
five hankie tearjerker. When Isaw
itthe whole theater was sobbing by
the end of the movie (except for
me, of course), so you might want
to bring a few extra Puffs along
with you. Well, I guess that wraps
it up for this week. Until next
time...

Tales of a campus ghost

Ghost continued from page 11

landed not on the stairs below, but
in the hall corner some way away.
Dr. Marcon suddenly said she felt

“in danger,” and left immediately
in a fright.

Commenting later on her ex-.

perience, Dr. Marcon said “all I
can say is that after the things hap-
pened while I was there I never
went back.” She plainly feels that
whatever happened, it was caused
by a presence of some kind, refer-
ting to it as a “thing.” “I think that
the thing is either anti-Christian or
more specifically, anti-Catholic,”
she stated, “because I was talking
about religious topics (saints and
angels) at the time it started dis-
rupting our conversation.”
Apparently, not only have
Marshall and Marcon experienced

these phenomenon. After Dr.
Marshall moved out, another visit-
ing professor and writer-in-resi-
dence moved in and had the same
problems, including footstep noises
and the shockingly cold spot in the
hall.

So what to make of all this?
Most of us, as critically thinking,
rational individuals, can surely as-
sign logical explanations for these
occurrences. Or can we? If one
Davidson professor can’t explain
them and another ran in sheer fear
from it, perhaps we too would find
ourselves at a loss. Maybe there’s
a ghost in Harding House. Maybe
there’s not.

This article was compiled using
telephone and e-mail interviews
with Dr. Bonnie Marshall and
Dr. Becky Marcon.
