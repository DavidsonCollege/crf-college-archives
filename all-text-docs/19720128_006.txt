Now there's a course
that pays ‘100 a month.

Army ROTC.

In our Advanced Course the monthly sub-
sistence allowance has just been increased. From $50 to $100.
One hundred dollars every month for 10 months of the school
year. To spend on room and board, dates and ball games.

‘Io save for grad school.

But Army ROTC means a lot more than more
money. It means management and leadership experience that
you just can’t get anywhere else. The kind of thing that can
land you a better job, and move you along faster once you
get it. It means a commission as an officer and everything

that goes with it. The prestige, the pay, the chance to travel,
the experience.

Now ROTC looks
even better. For the money
you ll earn today. For the person
you ll be tomorrow. See your
Professor of Military Science,
or send the coupon for
information. |

The more you look at it,
