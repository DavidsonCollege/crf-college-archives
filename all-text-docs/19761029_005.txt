Disco causes no real harm

To the Editor:

In response to Richard Boyce’s
article ‘‘Monotony Plagues Disco
Sound,’’ I must say that if it is not
ridiculous, it is disturbing. It is dis-
turbing becaused it raised only a
superficial compliment in the last
issue of The Davidsonian. Even
though I am a relative newcomer, I
have sensed that the students here
have an ‘‘opén”’ mind and a respect
for the rights of others. I hope that I
am not wrong.

It is apparent that Mr. Boyce does
not care for disco and neither do I, but
this is not the point. The point is that
I have a respect for what a person
wishes to do with his or her time. I

feel that I have no right to criticize a .

person’s actions unless someone else
suffers as a result of that action. If
anyone has suffered any undue harm
from a disco, I am sure that there is a
place in Ripley’s Believe It Or Not for
such a person.

Agreed, disco is not innovative but
rather repetitive in nature. However,
to state that disco’s origins lie with
the origins of soul and beach music
(purportedly from the “blacks’’ and
the ‘‘white middle of the gay sub-
culture’’) is absurd. It is absurd

because it has no foundations, just as
it is absurd to say that I am messy
because I was toilet trained late in my
childhood. I may, in fact, be messy
but. not because I did not learn to
handle myself on the john as early as
my peers. If, by some remote chance,
disco does come from the gay bar
scene, one wonders what the implica-
tions are. These implications may
best be grasped in the answer tg; two
questions. Does this mean that disco
should be unpleasant to us becapse it

originated from a group of people with,

a particular sexual preference? Does
President Ford beat his wife? I
sincerely hope not and seriously
doubt it.

Disco may be unpleasant to Mr.
Boyce just as it is unpleasant for me
to stick my fingers in a fan and for
that reason, I keep my hand away
from the fan. I do not criticize people
for the way they dress and, in turn, I
do not expect to be criticized for the
way I dress. If one were to go to a gay
bar anywhere, he would probably find
a variety of dress ranging from
business suits to sweat suits. Fash-
ions are not an indication of hetero- or
homo-sexuality, they are fashions;
clothes that are popular for people to

Military abuses power

To the Editor:

After reading the letters from the
individuals who support the military
on the grounds that it defends our
“freedom”, I found myself wondering
if we lived in the same universe.
Granted, defense of freedom is an
honorable and worthy ideal, but my
question is when was the last time the
American Military was employed in
the defense of freedom in the last 15
years? The Vietnam war is probably
the biggest case in point. The North
Vietnamese people were struggling
for independence from Imperialism
and Colonialism, wanting the freedom
simply to live as they chose, doing the
things they chose to do. |

ment felt differently, and the military
was sent to maintain the corrupt,
oppressive regime of Thieu in the
South. Another case that comes to
mind is the Kent State affair, where a

Or

group of students, some protesting
the War and some simply going to
class were shot and killed by the
National Guard. Perhaps the military
does defend freedom, but whose
freedom are we talking about?
Perhaps it is the freedom of a small
group of generals in the Pentagon to
exert their power and influence over
various areas of the world, or the
freedom of a group of industrialists to
support war in order to sell more
tanks, planes, guns, etc., or the
freedom of government leaders to
forcibly quell any protest of the
policies or actions of the government.
The military is not controlled by the
people, rather it is an instrument used
to promote the desires of the ruling

class in America.

Attitudes appall Jonas

To the Editor:

“Friends with common interests
and experiences’”’ and the temporal
and spacial opportunities to pursue
those interests is one of the great
pillars upon which growth and dev-
elopment rest. Along with discipline
and openness in approaching what we
find strange, it forms the mainstream
of education. Unfortunately for all,
the administration and faculty all too
often not only ignore the first of these
but actually flee from it.

wear.

The waltz and the tango, like disco
dances, are types of dances which can
be considered ‘‘codified” and where do
their origins lie? Football, too, is
“codified’’ and its participants dress
alike; tight pants and knit shirts
usually displaying a ‘‘svelte torso’. I
dare anyone who values their life to
tell the world that football’s origins lie
in the ‘“‘white middle of the gay sub-
culture’.

No, I did not miss the point of Mr.
Boyce’s article, I merely consider it
absurd and extremely unjust. The
article criticizes an individual’s right
to choose and that is as absurd as
Nixon being re-elected on Nov. 2.
And remember: It is people like us
that give the people who wish to be
seen the satisfaction of watching; or,
if you don’t look, you can’t see.

One blatant example will suffice.
Last year one of the first black
football players to actually complete
all four years in football and academ-
ics at Davidson graduated. His story
is a fascinating one of constant
self-suppression and constant search-
ing for sparks of self-affirmation and
joy in an alien world. Through tre-
mendous strength, discipline and
external support, he was able to
emerse himself in a foreign culture
which was so often emotionally
sterile, and survive. His plight did
not have to be so. Only the fear and
ignorance of the administration, fac-
ulty and students around him made
and kept it so.

The article on black students at
Davidson in last week’s Davidsonian
is more than an exposition pf ‘‘min-
ority status”’ or “identity crisis’. It is
a description of culture shock and
affects the attitude and health of
students, school and society. It is
what all students experience here at
Davidson, though usually to a lesser
degree. The administration offers it
usual sympathy responses in an
elegant and automatic fashion. This
sympathy, no matter how genuine, is
a cover for its deeper lack of
understanding. If faculty, admini-
stration and to a lesser degree,
students had the courage to face their
ignorance with sincerity, they would
be able to find simple and direct
solutions to:such problems. As is,
action is lacking; their understanding
is lacking; their values lie elsewhere—
perhaps with personal integrity, per-
haps with survival of the college’s
artificial image, perhaps survival of
the college itself, perhaps with some-
thing—, not with building a balanced
environment for education and
growth.

As we frolic through this fall term,
we could do well to give a moment’s
thought to some-of the absurd and
unnecessary sufferings that bring us
Davidson as it is today.

Donations appreciated

To the Editor:

On behalf of the Board of
Governors of Bushiangala Secondary
School, we would like to thank you
and all the people who helped you to
collect the $2,350.00.

This money, when converted into
Kenya shillings comes to KShs.
19;756/50. We were planning to give
this money on a Harambee Day on
October 30th, 1976, but the date was
not confirmed by the government.
Therefore, we have postponed our
Harambee Day until March 1977. In
the meanwhile we have scheduled a
Parents Day on October 30th for the
purpose of explaining to parents the
policies of school and giving them a
chance to meet the staff and Board.

On the same day we plan to hold a
small fund raising to collect money to
build a girls’ dormitory and teachers
jhouses. Your money will be given on
that day.

Once again, thank you for your
efforts.

Yours sincerely ,
Ethan Atkin
Headmaster, Bushiangala School

If you have forgotten, the money
was raised through the Davidson
Track Team’s 24 hour relay. Their
herculean effort of 266 miles, 1556
yards is the fourth best in the world
for 1976 (according to the September,
1976 issue of Runners World)- not to
mention the money that they raised.

The major purpose of this letter is
to say THANKS. It is refreshing to
realize that the Davidson community
has enough concrete interest in the
developing countries to raise this
substantial sum of money. Thanks
again,

The Bushiangala Alumni
Davidson College
