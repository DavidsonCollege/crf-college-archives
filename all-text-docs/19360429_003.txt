THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 29, 1936

MASQUERS ARE
TO GIVE FARCE
TUESDAY NIGHT

Presentation Will Be a Three-

Act Play “Three-Cornered
Moon”

TO BE UNUSUAL COMEDY

Play Presented on Broadway
And Called “A Romp”

By FITZHUGH DADE
In 1932, when “Yhree-Cornered
*Moon— was - tirst presented on
Broadway, the august: New York
Times chortled thus pver the com,
edys “lt is a bharum-searam lark
danced on the surface of a down-

at-the- a whirl-
~wind of impudent irrelevancies—a
demented antic—a romp—."  Cer-

tainly, if the Times unbent ta say
this about the play, it must have
the ability to provgke many a
laugh, much enthusiastic comment.
The play—which is onty six days
otf—will be the first comedy which
will make its appeal strongest to
Davidson students. Unlike several
that could have been picked, this
play has no aim of improving the
dramatic taste of the students, be-
ing mercly intended to provide a
pleasant ecvening’s entertainment,
and give occupation to amateur ac-
tors, who would starvevin the big
world, .
From almost every point of view

the Rimplegars are moonstruck.
Even if you study. this family
around wham the action cevotves
you will never hear two words

which make sense. In the first act
they are considerably well off in
the world; and being spared the
necessity of working, they take out
their lunacy in inventing compli-
cated methods of suicide or in im-
pulsive journeys. But suddenly they
find themselves penniless. Mrs.
Rimpiegar, having sold out the
family fortune to a margin broker,
puts on her wrapper, does up her
hair in a Qvurkish towel and me-
anders dizzily around the
That is why the Rimplegar children
all go to work al stanvation wages,
and become a clan with a cause. But
idle or industrious, a Rimplegar is
‘From one day to
the next he never tampers with
logic.

The imperturbable Mrs, Rimple-
garand her household of mercurial
children have thei prototypes in
any community. The Doctor; who
seems to be the  comamon-sensical
hero of the drammer_is a man we
know intimately. and as for Donald
the author, every village has one or
more of these visionaries.

Characters in this play are likely
to be embarrassed by the rather un-
complimentary descriptions in the
front of the play-books. = Mrs.
Rimplegar is aglazed, rattle-brained
woman whose gestures are uncer-
tain and whose reactions are belat-
ed. She. is motherly-looking, but not
sugary; although she would prob-
ably like to be, she doesn’t dare,
her children beiag what they are.

Douglas is about twenty-two. For
some reason that is never very clear
to anybody, he thinks that he has
dramatic ability and would like to
go on the stage. I'n his ordinary
conversation he is not-happily, the-
atrical, but every once in a while
he pulls what he calls a gag.

Kenneth is twenty-hve, and has
more dignity Ulan all the other
Rimplegars put together, which, to
be sure, is not saying overmuch for
Kenneth. His speech is affected,
his accent being cither Marvardian
or Oxonian, whichever is most un-
pleasant to you.

Jenny is a red-cheeked, husky
Czechoslovakian girl; Ed must be
mysterious in some obscure way,
for-the book merely—says of-him

that he “is eighteen.”
Elizabeth is a dark girl about

serious

eyes and no dignity at all.

the coveted prize given aunually by

“We're Losing Money.” and with
pockets bulging with the much dis-
cussed Ummoney bags. So nobody
