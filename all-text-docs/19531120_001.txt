CHARLES LAUGHTON

Dr. Frank Caldwell
To Speak af Vespers

The Vesper’s speaker this Sunday
night is Rev. Frank H. Caldwell,
Ph..D., D.D. Born in Corinth, Mis-
sissippi, in 1902, he began his ex-
tensive higher education at the
United States Military Academy in
1919.

After attending the University
of Mississippi, he went to Centre
College, where he received an A.B.
degree in 1926, a D.D. in 1936, and
a L.L.D., in 1947.

Graduate study at New York
University was next, and as a
Humphrey Fellow, he attended the
University of Edinburg, receiving
a Ph. D. in 1934.

Since then, his main concern
has been the Louisville Presby-
terian Seminary, which is sup-
ported by all the Presbyterian
Churches in the United States. In
1927, he became Assistant to the
President, then Professor of Homi-
letics in 1930, and President in
1936. He is also on the Board of
Directors at the present time.

During this time, he has also
been the pastor of Presbyterian
churches in Bradfordsville, Ky., and
McComb, Miss, as well as Acting
Professor of Bible at Centre Col-
lege.

Active not only in religious cir-
cles, both educational and profes-
sional associations have benefited
from his services. His evident skil!
and knowledge make him very
weleome to our pulpit.

By JOHN T. HARMON

Charles Laughton, among the
best-loved actors of the modern
stage and screen, will present one
of the outstanding numbers of this
year’s Davidson College Artist
Series when he gives his perform-
ance, “An Evening With Charles
Laughton,” in Chambers Audito-
rium on Tuesday, December 1, at
8:15 o’clock.

Tiekets for this pertormance
. must be obtained from the of-
fice of Mrs. French in the

College Union before the

Thanksgiving holidays or else

be forfeited. No seats will be

reserved,

Beginning his dramatic career
in his native England, Laughton
first won recognition by gaining
the attention of George Bernard
Shaw when he received the Ban-
croft gold medal from the Royal
Academy of Dramatic Art.

Breaking headlong into a field
traditionally reserved only for
those of handsome face and well-
favored figure, Laughton rocketed
to stardom by captivating audience
after audience with his versatile
acting.

After many theatrical successes
in England, the United States, and
France, Laughton found that his
real interest lay in giving readings,
the field from which he gained the
greatest inner enjoyment.

Using this néw medium of the
theatre, Laughton collaborated with
agent Paul Gregory to produce and
direct the First Drama Quartette
in its performance of Shaw's “Don
Jaun in Hell.” Even greater suc-
cess followed when Laughton di-
rected Benet’s “John Brown's
Body” with such stars as Tyrone
Power, Raymond Massey and Judith
Anderson.

Combined with his amazing eru-
dition, phenomenal memory, and
universal interests is an informall-
ty that is the keynote of each of
his readings. He is equally versed
in Plato, James Thurber, and Mark
Twain, and can quote the Bible
and Shakespeare verbatim for
whole chapters and acts on end.

Laughton had planned to come
to Davidson last -year, but for
reasons of health the performance
was cancelled. As he planned his
present tour, he was particularly
desirious to fill the engagements
which had been cancelled in the
1952-53 season.

CONCERT BAND STARS
FAMED SAXOPHONIST

The Davidson College Concert Band will present Sigurd
Rascher, world famous saxophonist, in its annual winter con-
cert on Friday night, December 4, at 8:15, in Chambers Audi-
torium. This represents the first attempt of the Davidson
Band to secure a nationally famous soloist for one of its con-
certs. Plans are now being made to bring a well-known soloist
or guest conductor to the campus each year.

Mr. Rascher has played in every

musical center of America and|#

Europe. He has been the first sax-
ophone soloist to play with such
organizations as the Boston Sym-
phony, the New York Philhar-
monic, and the Royal Philharmonic
of London.

Rascher has developed a range
of four octaves on the standard,
factory-made, instrument and
mouthpiece, -~which are normally
confined to only two and one-half
octaves.

Mr. Rascher will appear in a
series of three concerts with the
Davidson Band. The first will be at
the Mooresville High School on
Thursday afternoon, December 3,
at 2:00. Another Thursday concert
will be presented at Appalachian
State College in Boone at 8:00 that
night. The final appearance of the
series will be here on Friday night.

Rascher will play two solos in
accompaniment with the concert
band. The first is “Introduction and
Samba,” an original composition
for saxophone and band by Whit-

~

tee

SIGURD RASCHER

followed by “Death and Transfigu-
ration” by Strauss and “Introduc-
tion and Samba.” Next will be
“Commando March,” a concert

ney. The second movement, “Sam- march for band by the American

ba,” uses the rhythmic devices of
the popular South American dance
of the same name. His second
piece will -be “Concerto for Saxo-
phone.” This was originally writ-
ten for orchestra by Glarunov and
‘transcribed for band by Russell
Howland of Fresno State College.

The opening piece of the con-
cert here will be Mendelssohn's
“Overture for Band.” This will be

composer Samuel Barber.

An original composition, “Fugue
for Band,” by a faculty member
of the University of North Caro-
lina will be conducted by Mr. Sat-
terfield. Rascher will then play his
second solo, “Concerto for Saxo-
phone.” The program will end with
two stirring marches by Sousa,
“Fairest of the Fair” and “King
Cotton.”

R.O.1.C. 10 OCCUPY
NEW DORM SPACE

New life will be added to the
ROTC department when the pro-
posed Belk dormitory is com-
pleted. As present plans stand the
two terrace floors, below ground
level from the front, will house
the military department.

Special features include a rifle
range on the first floor of the
right wing, sound absorbing ceil-
ings, and folding doors to vary the
size of the class rooms. There will
be five rooms available for lec-
tures, an operations room for
demonstrations, an armory, and
office space.

Of interest to those students di-
rectly above the first two floors
is the eight-inch thick concrete
floor with sound absorbing ma-
terial on the bottom. This is guar-
anteed to lessen the clatter of
training films.

For those who are still confused
as to the location of the dorm it
will be placed between and about
seventy feet in back of West and
Watts.The rear will be about even
with the laundry. The two wings
will be parallel with the north
side of Chambers, thus being at a
slight angle to West and Watts.

Contrary to popular belief the
old ROTC building is not to be
used as fire wood or given over
to the rats but rather it wil) serve
as a shop and storage space for
the maintenance department. D.
Grier Martin informed the Devid-
sonian that several thousand dol-
lars are being spent to move the
building.

GRADUATE SCHOOLS
TO REQUIRE TESTS

The Educational Testing Service
has just announced that beginning
with the academic year 1953-1954,
a@ group of business schools and
divisions will require applicants
for admission to graduate study
in the fall of 1954 to take the Ad-
mission Test for Graduate Study in
Business.

Among these institutions are the
graduate business schools or di-
visions of the following universi-
ties: Columbia University, Harvard
University, Northwestern Univer-
sity, Rutgers University, Seton Hall
University, University of Chicago,
University of Michigan, University
of Pennsylvania, and Washington
University (St. Louis).

A candidate must make separate] p.m,

application for admission to each
business school or division of his
choice and should inquire of each
whether it wishes him to teke the
Admission Test for Graduate Study
in Business and when.

Since many business schools and
divisions select their entering
classes in the spring preceding
their entrance, candidates for ad.
mission to the 1054 classes are ad-
vised to offer the February test, if
possible.

The Admission Test for Graduate
Study in Business is not designed
to test specific knowledge in spe-
clalized academic subjects. Nor-

‘| mal undergraduate training should
' provide sufficient general knowl-
‘ledge to answer the test questions.
“\Sample questions and information

regarding registration for and ad-
ministration of the test are given
in a Bulletin of Information.

The tests will be administered
on February 6, 1954, and May 13,
1954. Applications and fees must
be filed with the Admission Test
for Graduate Study in Business,
Educational Testing Service, 20
Nassau Street, Princeton, New Jer-
sey, at least two weeks before the
testing date desired in order to al-
low ETS time to complete the
necessary testing arrangements.

BULLETIN

Mrs. R. A. Little, supervisor of
the dormitories, has announced
that the dormitories will remain
open during the Thanksgiving holi-
days to accommodate those stu-
dents who will remain on campus.
She requests that those students
who will be here at that time
please inform their janitors of that
fact.

Davidsonians Back

By GILBERT GRAGG

Ten tired but contented David-
son students returned to the cam-
pus early Monday morning after
an informative and exciting week-
end in New York, November 13-15,
at the United Nations Seminar for
College Students. This seminar was
sponsored by the National Student
YMCA and YWCA.

The seminar. opened on Friday
morning with the rogistration of
over 300 students from all over
the country at the Grand Central
Branch YMCA on 47th Street. After
a devotional and_ introductory
remarks of explanation, the group
went on to the United Nations
grounds where they spent the rest
of the day learning about inter-
national affairs.

Perhaps the highlight of the
day's activities was attending the
Géneral Assembly meeting and see-
ing the various representatives
from sixty of the world’s countries.
Interest was especially focused to-
ward the Russian delegation and
Vishinsky who debated vehement-
ly for about an hour against con-
trol of atomic weapons.

Delegates to the conference had
earphones, and by turning a dial
could listen to the proceedings
either in English, German, Chinese,
Russian or Spanish. Some of the
students also sat in on sessions of
the various committces such as the
Human Rights or Technical As-
sistance Branches which are very
important parts of the United Na-
tion’s work.

Friday afternoon the program
was interesting and varied. First
the conference was addressed by
two of the United States workers
in the United Nations, who ex-
plained America's policies on cer-
tain important matters and how
the non-Communist countries look
to ours for leadership.

Then came an address by Mr.
Arthur Liveran of the Israeli
delegation in which he stressed the
mistreatment of the Zionists in the
Holy Land. Immediately upon con-
clusion of this speech, the confer-
ence group heard the other side
of this controversial question.
which is one of the major problems
now facing the UN, skillfully pre-
sented by Dr. Zeineddin of Syria.

The afternoon’s program was con-
cluded by two discussion groups
on India and Yugoslavia, which are
hotspots in the world today. These

LOCAL NEGRO HUT|Freshman Parents
From U.N. Seminar ‘GETS STUDENT VOTE|Invade DC Saturday

FOR Y GIFT FUND

Three projects for this year's
YMCA Gift Fund were presented
for student consideration on Wed-
nesday. The vote was decidedly in
favor of the local project which
was to provide a hut for whole-
some recreation to be used by the
Negro community. The cost in-
volved for this plan includes from
$600 to $700 to improve the hut,
$500 to move it to a new lot, $600
or $700 for more equipment, and
$3,000 for an endowment for main-
tenance and a permanent director.

A second project suggested con-
cerned the need for a first-rate
hospital in Portugal. A letter from
Herb Meza, one of the first
Protestant missionaries to Portu-
gal and a former president of the
Davidson YMCA, was read. It stated
that funds are desperately needed
for equipment, since disease is
widespread and there is much dis-
crimination against Protestants
which retards progress there.

The third project that was pre-
sented emphasized the needs of
the Glade Valley School near Roar-
ing Gap.

Between 150 and 200 parents of
members of the Freshman Class
are expected to arrive tomorrow
morning for the Freshman Parents
Day.

Registration at the College Union
will start at nine o’clock and con-
tinue until eleven. During these
hours there will also be informal
tours of the campus.

From eleven to twelve there will
be a conference on freshman prob-
lems in the College Union Ball-
room, led by Dean John C. Bailey
and other college officials.

Lunch will be served in the cafe-
teria from twelve till two, and the
parents will eat with the members
of the Freshman Class.

The parents will sit in the stu-
dént section as guests of the col-
lege at the Davidson-Citadel foot-
ball game which starts at 2:30.

The purpose of the Freshman
Parents’ Day is to give the parents
an opportunity to become acquaint-
ed with the college, to meet and
talk with the faculty and staff of
the college, and to meet their sons’
friends and their parents. The of-
ficials of the college hope that the

'OMICRON DELTA KAPPA
SELECTS NINE SENIORS

PUCKETT ADDRESSES
STUDENTS AT CHAPEL

By TOM WARLICK
During the chapel period
Tuesday, Delta Circle of Omi-
cron Delta Kappa held its fall

'|tapping exercises. The main

speaker for the occasion was
Dr. W. O. Puckett of the Da-
vidson College faculty, who
presented a talk on the history
and ideals of Omicron Delta
Kappa.

Following Dr. rucxett’s speech,
nine seniors, Max Devane, Bob
Crutchfield, Alden Williams, Hun-
ter Strader, Fred Stowe, Homer
Sparks, Buddy Lamon, Charlie Has-
sell, and Ben Craig were tapped
by student members of the society.

Dr. Puckett in his speech
described the founding of Omicron
Delta Kappa and the part that Da-
vidson played in its conception.

Dr. Puckett told that Omicron

’{ Delta Kappa was founded at Wash-

ington and Lee University on De-
cember 3, 1914 by Dr. Henry
Lewis Smith. Dr. Smith, a former
Davidson student, came back to
Davidson in 1901 as a professor of
physics. Having exemplified the
principles of leadership, he was
chosen a few years later as Presi-
ident following Dr. J. B. Scherer.
It was a few years later that he
accepted the presidency of Wash-
ington and Lee.

“It was felt by Dr. Smith and
his associates that some group
should be established for the recog-
nition of leadership,” continued
Dr. Puckett. Starting with four
circles of which the Delta Circle
was the fourth, the fraternity has
grown until there are now over
75 circles.

The speaker closed by pointing
out that there are five prerequi-
sites for membership in the
society. They are character, lead-
ership, scholarship, fellowship and
consecration to democratic ideals.

MAX DEVANE

Max Devane from Jennings, Fla.,
is majoring in history. He is the
Freshman Advisor, Regimental
Commander of the ROTC and In-

Masquers To Present Everyman
And Chrenicle Of Joe Dec. 14, 15

The Red and Black Masquers’
productions of “Everyman” and
“The Chronicle of Joe” will be pre-
sented on December 14 and 15 in
the ballroom of the College Union.
Rehearsals of the two plays are al-
ready under way.

“Everyman” is the modern pro-
fessional dramatic version, written
by Hugo von Hofmannsthal, of the
older English morality play which
is studied in English literature
here at Davidson. Basically it is
the same theme, but von Hof-
mannsthal has expanded many of
the ideas presented in the earlier
play. -

The play is a psychological
drama of man’s experience with
reality and the changes whiclr re-
sult, a theme which is timeless,
being just as applicable today as
when first used.

Fred Summers will play in the

By MAURICE CROUSE

title role as Everyman. Others in
the cast include Buddy Beehler,
Bob Dunbar, Tom Morgan, Kerry
Spiers, Ed Hadley, Albert Harris,
Willis Briley, Bill Berryhill, Tom
Estes, Phil Kukura, Harold Hall,
Jack Graham, Allie Cone, Mrs.
Howard Lamar, and Mrs. Tom
Daggy.

Swain Loy is director of the
play, and Sam Sutton and Boyce
Martin are on the production staff.

“Everyman” will be presented
as a modern play, using the semi-
round technique in which the audi-
ence sits on three sides of the
stage. Dress will be modern ex-
cept for the ultra-symbolic char-
acters. There will be no scenery—
Ughting effects will be used in-
stead.

Coupled with “Everyman” will
be “The Chronicle of Joe,” a
tragedy and seml-morality play,
written and directed by Fred

Myers. It differs from the morality
play in that it has real characters
as well as abstract ones.

Joe is a department store worker
who is trying rather unsuccessfully
to get ahead. The drama deals with
his attempts to make a fresh start
before it is too late.

The character of Joe will be
played by Prof. Benjamin Wilson.
The cast includes Dunbar Ogden,
Willis Briley, Bob Haywood, Ed
Hadley, Phil Lee, Alden Williams,
Herb Russell, Mrs. Sam Magill, and
Mrs. Bill Dole.

The method of staging “The
Chronicle of Joe” will be the same
as for “Everyman,” except that the
costuming will be entirely modern.

This is the first time that stu-
dent directors have been used for
Masquer productions. Professor
Raymond Tyson will work in an
advisory capacity, assisted by Bob
Mims.
