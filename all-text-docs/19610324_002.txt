The Trustees And Big Business

The Davidson College Board of
Trustees last met on Wednesday, Feb-
ruary 15. They will meet again on
Thursday, May 18. These are the only
times that this group assembles in a
body on the campus.

_ During the February meeting
time the trustees tend strictly to
business. They have virtually no con-
tact with students and members of
the faculty. There was a dinner for
the trustees and faculty wives and fe-
male college personnel in the Union:
Professors stayed at home, minded the
kinds and ate leftovers.

During the May gathering the
trustees will meet with student dis-
cussion groups in the fraternity houses
during one afternoon. The topics for
these discussions will generally be
carefully selected. but now and again
a trustee will be embarrassed by a
question he can’t answer. These dis-
cussion groups are about the only con-
tact a group of trustees ever has with
a group of students.

Trustees are under virtual house
arrest when they come to Davidson.
They shuttle back and forth to meet-
ings with hardly a glance into the af-
fairs of the neart of the college — its
Students.

Perhaps too many share the feel-
ing of one member of the board who
said last February that Davidson Col-
lege is just a corporate business and
the students are shareholders . .
minor shareholders at that. The Board
of Trustees is the board of directors
and it is they who make the decisions,
not the stockholders.

If Davidson is a corporation, its
product is far too important for even
the minor stockholders not to have a
voice in its corporate decisions.

Its product is education and edu-
cation doesn’t roll off an assembly
line.

Its product is liberal arts, not
soap flakes.

Its product is men, not Reynolds
Wrap, or Marboros, or Peter Pan
Crunchy Peanut Butter.

Trustees know little about the
heart of the matter with which the
are entrusted. We can see no justifi-
cation for this. Nor can we see why
something can’t be done about it.

The trustees do not have a full-
scale meeting during the fall semes-
ter. We propose a third meeting of
the board, a two-day visit to the
campus during which the trustees
would, in effect, live the life of a
student.

They would stay in the dorms,
each sharing a room with a student.
They would attend classes, eat at fra-
ternity houses, perhaps take in an in-
tramural athletic event or a play re-
hearsal. In other words, the trustee’s
time would be unbudgeted. There
would be plenty of room for informal
bullsessions. They would not be squir-
ed around by administrative officials
or members of the public relations
department.

Planned activities such as panel
discussions could. be included in the
schedule, but this sort of thing should
be held to a minimum and should be
conducted in as flexible a manner as
possible.

The initiation of this experiment
would have to come through the ad-
ministration and the board itself. We
feel however that the Student Coun-
cil should coordinate the trustees’
actual visiting time.

Board Chairman J. McDowell
Richards agreed after the February
meeting that ‘there is room for im-
provement” in student-trustee con-
tact. When asked about the practical-
ity of a plan similar to the one out-
lined above, he said that he felt most
trustees would be wiliing to take a
couple of days off to go through with
it.

We hope so.

Davidson College may be com-
pared to’ a corporation, but its pro-
duct is no machine-tooled toy.

It’s time the board of directors
acquainted themselves with the min-
ority stockholders.

The Last Of The Cools

President Kennedy's brightest
campaign idea, the Peace Corp, has
fired collegiate imaginations across
the country...

The upsurge of student response
to the Peace Corps project has been
so great that Life Magazine and NBC’s
Huntley-Brinkley television news re-
port have both given wide coverage
to it in recent days.

At Ohio State University, inter-
est runs so high that an office has
been set up by would-be Peace Corps-
men; the group issues a newspaper,
Sponsors weekend trips to Peace Corps
Headquarters in Washington, disper-
ses information and helps dispatch
applications from Ohio State — of
which there are hundreds.

Student newspapers across the
country — including those at southern
schools like Alabama and Emory —
report Peace Corps enthusiasm at high
tide on their campuses.

But at Davidson, the Peace Corps
has caused scarcely a ripple — and
certainly no rush of volunteers.

A file of information placed on
library ‘reserve by Student Body Pre-
sident Henry Shue has found few
readers.

Davidson's science and pre-medi-
cal majors, the most likely candidates
for Peace Corps jobs, have shown no
visible interest.

There is almost no campus dis-
cussion of the Peace Corps.

It would be ridiculous to make
harsh judgments about anybody sim-

ply because he has not leapt aboard
the Peace Corps bandwagon; but none-
theless Davidson's indifference to an
idea which is sweeping the country
is a matter of interest.

What’s the explanation?

In part, it’s the obvious fact that
the Peace Corps will have few jobs to
offer liberal arts graduates. But per-
haps there’s more to it.

Perhaps Davidson's indifference
is just another symptom of that old
bugbear of the student chapel ora-
tors: apathy, and our persistent al-
lergy to any kind of commitment.

Davidson men, it is well known,
are pre-professional larvae — seed-
lings of success requiring careful post-
graduate nourishment; we don’t have
time to build sewers for Zulus.

Commitment ‘is not cool.

If this is true of us, our attitude
may be obsolete. A new spirit seems
to be rising on campuses elsewhere.

One student editor, at a school
where Peace Corps applicants are as
thick as locusts, had this to say:

“We are seeing the rise of the
Concerned Generation, the generation
of the alert, the alive, the inyolved.
Old Joe College with his casual in-
difference to world crisis and world
need is gone. The Cool Generation is
dead.”

Dead? Not at Davidson.

But we may be the last of the
Cools.

Interested Students Keep
Phi And Eu Alive Today

By LEONARD RICHARDSON

Davidsonien Feature Editor

This week the oldest stud-
ent organizations on camp-
us held their formal initia-
tions. They have both de-
clined in prominence during
the past 124 years, but in-
terested students keep them
alive. :

The Philanthropic and Eu-
menein Societies were once
the center of almost all ex-
tracurricular activity on
campus. For more than 50
yéars officers of Phi and
Eu were the most- influen-
tial men in the student body,
and the societies were re-
sponsible for student gov-
ernment.

The literary societies
were founded four months
after the college opened
in 1837. Their primary pur-
pose was debating, but
they offered training in
writing, parliamentary us-
age, and public speaking
as well.

The Eumencan and Phil-
anthropic Halls, facing each
other on the south end of
the old quadrangle, were

MiLene RO

built in 1849.

The societies debated “Is
slavery a blessing or a
curse?” in the 1830's, fought
the Mexican War verbally in
the 40's, and argued the pros
and cons of secession from
the late 50’s to 1861.

Decreased enrollment
during the Wer Between
the Stetes caused them to
disband temporarily, but
by 1866 Eu members
were wondering, “Are we
justified in emigrating
from the South now?” and
men In Phi debated, “Is
the Congress of the United
States justified in exclud-
ing Southern Members?”
in 1867.

Gay society parties were
held at commencements dur-
ing the 1870's, 80's, and 90's.
Choosing juniors from Phi
and Eu to serve as com-
mencement marshals is a
custom still in practice.

The Societies fell on evil
times in the 20th century.

Debating an d_ baseball
games between the two so-
cieties lost first place in
student interest to intercol-
legiate athletics. Social life

came to center around Greek-
letter fraternities.

Another function was taken
away from Phi and Eu when
Davidson's first Student
Council was organized. With
the rise in enrollment from
100 in 1900 to about 950 to-
day, other organizations were
formed on campus.

The Halls were painted a
glaring red to preserve the
bricks. Few students knew
their history until 1956
when the generosity of
Mrs. Clarence Hodson of
Orange, New Jersey made
full restoration possible.
in an impressive ceremony
at Homecoming five years
ago, the laevishly-restored
Hollis were officially pre-
sented to the college.
When they were presented

in 1956, Dr. Chalmer G. Dav-
idson said, “. . . Today the
Halls stand as proudly as they
did 106 years ago, a symbol
that Davidson College is not
yet ready to bow to the
winds of change and _ sur-
render those intellectual, so-
cial, and religious stand-
ards upon which she was
founded.”

“Well, | guess that’s the last of tho se damn liberals on the newspaper. !
figured they were crazy all along. They’ ve aireaay got Millner in the truck.”

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Thomason [s Convinced

Union Facilities Are OK

Dear Editor:

“Davidson's, o u t moded
ways of getting around the
Sermon on the Mount”
would be an interesting the-
sis for a uniquely significant
paper — uniquely significant
because it is not cool to be
concerned to the extent of
action at Davidson. Real mo-
tives are coolly disguised
with false pretense.

The two chief ways of by-
passing the Sermon on the
Mount at Davidson are wide-
spread. One is most often
suggested by members of the
Bible Dept. who never cease
to remind us that “this, stud-
ents, is an impossible ethic.”
Ignorant is our proper desig-
nation!

COMPELLED

The second has compelled
me, as a “Forgotten Man,”
to reply to Archpoet, and
Archexaggerator Duggan who
doubtless was sincere in last
week’s editorial: the ever
present perpetuation of in-
significant issues in a world
which provides many threats
to our cozy little world —
over-population, famine, il-
literacy, and that which is of
most immediate importance
to us, discrimination with ir-
rational bases.

Last week “The Forgot-
ten Man” was the insignifi-
cant issue. His “plight” is
not unbearable, if indeed
there is a “plight.” If there
were a real problem, the de-
mand for creative change
would likely have arisen from
independent quarters. Frat-
ernity men seem to have an

overwhelming need to make.

the independents after their
own image!
FALSE IMAGE
The major concrete sug-

gestions of Editor Duggan in-
volved the unity of independ-
ents with each other and
with that false image, Dav-
idson College, and limited
social life, particularly as
embodied in dance-weekends.

Independent, by definition,
precludes a tightly knit or-
ganization. Since the inde-
pendents do not represent a
tightly knit unit, it is hardly
likely that an independent
vote on the IFC would be re-
presentative. Non-voting re-
presentation is adequate. Be-
sides, having a vote would
entail the responsibility of
buying a certain number of
dance tickets.

NO LOSS

The independent has noth-
ing to lose since he possesses
no social ties. But, while he
has nothing to lose, he has
everything to give freely
since he is bound by no so-
cial covenant. Independents
participate in most phases of
campus life. We may be for-
gotten men, but we are not
idle men!

However, we flatly deny
that the bond between inde-
pendents is less than “‘friend-
ship and common interest.”
The Union offers sufficient
tables for us to live in com-
plete isolation and some few
independents eat elsewhere!
We scatter our social life

from New York to Florida.
DO NOT DATE

As for dance-weekends,
most independents do not
date. The lesser social facil-
ities are only a minor con-
tributing factor in most cases.
Not all independents are
poverty stricken, but some
of us are independent both
by choice and by financial
necessity.

For those of us who date,
quiet conversation, and yes,
even study is quite as pleas-
ant as boisterous and some-
times less than sober after-
dance parties.

Stated more concisely, a
$10 weekend can be quite as
enjoyable as a $30 hangover,
either from lack of sleep or
from the more probable
cause, but typically both. Five
in the morning is not neces-
sarily the most romantic
hour!

e e

Being firmly convinced
that our facilities and social
life are adequate, may I sug:
gest, if the problem is real,
interested independents have
more than adequate time to
initiative creative change.

If there were real concern
for our “plight,” each enter-
ing freshman would long ago
have been offered a fratern-
ity bid.

He silenced the crowd and there were testimonials.

A woman rose to recount a miraculous cure which Allen
had worked on her in 1955.

She finished and Allen grabbed the microphone.
“Glory to God!” he cried. “Thank you, Jesus!”

The Pious Dance As
He Casts Out Demons

By ERVIN DUGGAN

Salvation full and free, along with speaking in ton-
gues, miracles and stiff doses of ecstatic prophecy are
being dispensed nightly at Charlotte’s Park Center.

in Charlotte March 18. ' .

Mr. Allen, apparently on more than normally inti-

“Eeecow!” shouted Allen, “Wonderful Jee-sus!”

He finished his invocation and addressed the crowd
of about two thousand.

odists or Presbyterians! Why, I bet you have to be told
when to shout hallelujah!” .
fat woman threw up her hands and cried “Halle-
lujah!” She began to sway and soon most of the congrega-
tion had begun clapping, shouting and singing, accom-
panied by Mr. Allen’s plastic-topped grand piano, a Ham-
mond organ, and a tambourine wielded by a colored
singer on the stage.

“This is just what it'll be like when we all get
to Heaven,” Allen shouted above the bedlam. “We'll

Allen held up a copy of his official journal, “Miracle
Magazine. “You can read it now!” he shouted. “Read a-
bout our healing ministry all over the world.

pictures, reported supernatural deliverances from “sugar

several varieties of incurable cancer.

On the platform, Allen and his assistants were jump-
ing and shouting. “Glory Jesus!” he yelled, and then he
spied a women on a hospital stretcher below the stage.

“Okay, little lady down there! We're gonna heal
you. God's genna heal you tonight!”

Two assistants rolled the stretcher up a ramp and
onto the stage.

“This little lady’s eaten up with cancer!” Allen ex-
claimed. “The last time them doctors opened her up they
just looked in and shook their heads.

“Do you believe God’ll heal this little lady of the
cancer devil?”

A chorus of shouts went up. They believed.

“Jee-sus!" God!" Allen’s voice ripped the silence.
“Heal this woman! Come out, you foul demon of
cancer! Come out, Satan!’

The preacher gripped the woman’s head and held on
hard. She began to stir. ‘

“She’s moving! Come out, you demon!”

The woman struggled to stand. She rose from the
stretcher, donned her shoes and strode from the plat-
form — “healed.”

Loud shouts and amens rose from the congregation.
There was a chorus of “Got Just What I wanted From The
Lord,” then three more healings.

“This woman hasn‘t moved in three years! They
took out a brain cancer and they accidentally cut the
co-ordinatin’ nerves in her neck.” She was instantly

collected them in buckets.

There was- more music, more shouting, frenzied

Allen said, “then he can use A. A. Allen!”

At Allen’s call, hundreds surged forward to be pray-

The organ began to play, and the rattling of the

jerking and trembling, tossing their heads, standing with
arms upraised as Allen prayed.
