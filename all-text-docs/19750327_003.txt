The Davidsonian

Davidson, White place high [t,

in Putnam mathematics exam

By LARRY MIMMS

Problem A-1:;

Call a set of positive integers
“conspirational” if no three of
them are pair wise relatively
prime. (1 set
“pairwise relatively prime” if no
pair of them: has a common
divisor greater than 1.) What is

the largest number of elements ’

of any “conspirational™ subset
of the integers 1 through 16?

This mathematical problem
and 11 others equally unique
confronted college
mathematicians in the 35th an-
nual Putnam Mathematical
Contest.

Davidson ranked 69th in the
contest among 374 par-
ticipating colleges and univer-
sities. Brian White was the top
scorer for Davidson with 25
points and placed 140th in the
nation.

_The Putnam exam consists of
12 problems to be solved .in six
hours. 2,159 undergraduate
students in the United States
and Canada took the test on
Dec. 7, 1974, but the scores had
not been published until March.

“These 2000 students are in-
variably the best college
mathematicians in the coun-
try’’, said assistant professor of
Mathematics Benjamin Klein,
who conducted the test session
at Davidson.

“Each problem counts 10
points and a person can get as
many as 120 points, however
the problems are hy no means

of integers is’

trivial,”’ he said.

“The top score in the country
was 77, but only 10 students in
the whole country got above 50.
About one fifth of the con-
testants do not. get a positive
score,’’ Klein added.

‘“‘Brian did well on the test. It
takes a combination of creativi-
ty, quick thinking, and exper-
ience on taking these kinds
of tests. Brian has _ these
qualities,’’ said Klein.

Several other Davidson

students did well on the exam..,

Klein cited Bob Lautensack,
Coty Pinckney, Steve Dodd,
Wade Lail, Mark Postove, and
Robert Scott.

“The only math courses
needed to understand the
problems are _ freshman
calculus and_ differential
equations. There is a big dif-
ference, however, between un-
derstanding what is asked for
in a problem and finding the

solution,” Klein said.

“A certain amount of
mathematical maturity is
needed to work hard problems.
One of the most important
things in doing well on a test-of
this kind is creativity, the
ability to determine original
approaches to problems that
are. very unlike textbook
problems.

“Knowing a lot doesn’t
necessarily help; one must see
unusual means of attack,” he
added.

Most people think that math
is a crank and grind procedure,
and can’t comprehend the idea
of mathematical creativity.
You can’t even begin to explain
what it is like to an outsider,”’
he said.

The Putman exam is given in
two 3-hour sessions, one in the
morning and one in the af-
ternoon of the test date.

A team of 12 graders score
every competitor’s test.

The five colleges whose
students did best on the Put-
nam exam were: University of
British Columbia,
Massachusetts Institute of
Téchnology, California In-
stitute of Technology, the
University of Chicago and
Harvard.

“Many schools have pre-tests
and make the Putnam exam -in-
to a high-pressure situation. We
aren’t like that. We want to
make this process of beating

one’s head against the wall for .

six hours as enjoyable as
possible,’”’ Klein said.

‘Untapped educational resource’
Extern program finds alumni support

engaged in an_ experiential

Extern Program over spring

Honors center adds staff

World food _ problems,
linguistics, and ,continuing
work with the Rocky River are
projected areas of study next
year at the Center for Honors
Studies. Also, an _in-
terdisciplinary program com-
paring the cultures of South
Asia, Mexico and the United
States will be offered either in
September, 1975 or in Sep-
tember, 1976.

Two seminars concerning
agriculture and world food
problems will be taught.
Professor of Biology William
T. Lammers, who joins the

. Center’s faculty in the fall,
will lead a study of the
genetics of the Green
Revolution. Professor of
Economics Ernest Patterson
will teach a course on com-
parative agricultural
economics.

The Honors Center has had
considerable trouble
developing a program of
linguistics studies for the
coming year.

The Honors Center now is
waiting for a reply to a request
for a grant from the National
Endowment for the
Humanities.

However, the Honors Center
will offer at least one seminar
in linguistics next year.
Professor of Psychology
Robert E. Till, who joins the
Center’s faculty in September,
will teach a seminar in
psycholinguistics.

Lammers will replace
Professor of Biology David
Grant, and Till will replace
Professor of Psychology John
Kelton in September.

Work on the Rocky River
Project will continue next
year. Four areas: economics,
politics, biology, and
chemistry, will still provide a
major thrust for the program.

In addition to the agricul-
tural economies and the
linguistics seminars, courses
in Chrisianity and the arts,
energy, and literature of the
1850’s will be taught.

“We expect to double
if
next year.’

the number of participants in the Extern program

purpose of the Extern program
is to let students have exposure
to people in the various fields.
In some cases, practical work
is done,’’ he added.

Because the program was
new this year, the number of
participants was limited to 20.
The response was so great that
the program ended up with 22.

‘We expect to double the
number of participants in the
Extern program next year. We
have not set any kind of goal or
ceiling on the number, but we
think we will realistically have
twice as many people _next
year, after the word gets
around how good the program
is,’ said Suzie Summers,
assistant director of Ex-
periential Learning.

“Not a lot of people really
knew about the Extern
program this year. Word of
mouth will help us. The people
involved this year will talk to
their friends and. they will
become interested,’’ she added.

Those who did participate
this year, both students ana
their alumni sponsors, gave the
Extern program a lot of feed-
back, most of which was.com-
plimentary. Students and spon-

sors were asked to fill out
evaluation sheets after the ex-
perience was over.

Talbert C. Bryant, ’64, an
Atlanta businessman wrote:
“The program is an excellent
opportunity for a senior or
junior student to experience at
an early age what life and
business is all about. I wish
such a program had been
available in 1960-1964. It should
be continued and expanded. We
are proud of what Davidson
College has done for us and the
program provides us a way to
show this to students.”’

Talbert was not alone in
feeling the way he did. Of the
requests the Experiential Lear-
ning office sent out to prospec-
tive sponsors, nearly all were
returned expressing
willingness to accept an intern.

‘We sent out 60 queries to
Alumni this year to see if they
were interested. 55 were
willing.’’ said Wood.

“It was our thought that if we
sent queries to 3 possible spon-
sors for each person, one would
answer back. We were’ sur-
prised to find that in most
cases, all three were willing. In

Mihe Sea” hy

fact, each of the alumni that
could not accept an intern were
going to be away from their
usual place of business during
the time of the program,” said
Summers.

The evaluations written by
students were supportive of the
program too. Tony Thomason,
who worked with Talbert
Bryant wrote: ‘‘I wouldn’t
trade the experience for
anything in the world. Suzie and
Ken have done a fabulous job.
The program could have been
half as good and still have been
well worth the time.”

From the positive feed-back
came some discussion of ex-
panding the program: The only
time that an expanded
program could be _ instituted
would.be in the summer. Plans
for such a program are being
considered. ;
