‘Rusk Returns For Davidson's '

BY BOB REYNOLDS
Davidsonian Staff Writer

At 11 p.m. Wednesday, Feb. 21, Secretary
of State David Dean Rusk, ’31, and Mrs. Rusk
stepped from their black limousine into the

| rainy mist hovering over the Davidson College
campus.

Thus quietly began a period which will rank
| among “Davidson’s finest hours.” The promin-
| ent alumnus, his wife and diplomatic and secur-

ity staffs were bringing the campus a new ex-
| citement and participation in government af-
fairs, combined with a long-awaited homecom-

ing.

8 As the third in the 1961-62 series of Rey-
nolds Lecturers, Mr. Rusk throughout the day
Thursday introduced overflowing crowds of
students, faculty and guests to a new level of
awareness of foreign policy.

In an off-the-record chapel talk and coffee
Thursday morning and a more formal press con-
ference and evening lecture, Mr. Rusk in frank,
concise tones defined our current principles of
foreign policy, presented the backgrounds to
recent news stories and gave his personal ap-
praisal of the international situation.

For the students, the activities of the day
were climaxed by the Reynolds Lecture. Here
in an hour talk, the Secretary lifted his audience
out of a maze of everyday events into a view of
the future.

“J am not pessimistic,” he said, “about find-
| ing a safer and more rational way for us all to
live on this small planet . . . We should be pre-
pared to work patiently—beginnin now—to-
wards the day when the community of independ-

ent nations and the United Nations itself become
identical.”

But for Mr. Rusk, there were a series of
climaxes and high spots all through the day as
he alternated in the roles of Secretary of State,
and just plain Dean “Elijah” Rusk, who walked
the campus as a student and worked in Davidson
as a bank employee 31 years ago.

Bad weather which canceled his scheduled
return flight to Washington last night gave the
Secretary a few more hours to reminisce. His
party left early today to “get back on the job.”

Even for two days, however, Rusk was not
able to forget his position. A mid-morning call
to Washington Thursday emphasized the fact,
as the Secretary had to keep his finger on the
pulse of international affairs. Wednesday night,

e had used his trip “home” to explain to a
group of hostile businessmen the importance of
the President’s new trade legislation before Con-
gress (see excerpts of that speech on page two.)

_ “DOWNTOWN HASN'T changed a_ bit,”
Dean Rusk told a corps of photographers Thurs-
day who followed him on a reminiscent tour of
the town.

From White Drug Company to Ralph John-
son’s Barber shop he walked the stretch of
stores, stopping to greet familiar faces. And
there were a number of them. After banging on
the locked door of the Piedmont Bank, he showed
awed tellers where he had worked three years

Phillips Recommends
IFC Reorganization

BY CHARLES DIBBLE
Davidsonian Staff Writer

“A dynamic organization with dynamic leadership.”
This is the desired result in the proposed reorganization
of the IFC as seen by its proposer, Sigma Nu President

Bob Phillips, who presented
meeting Monday night.

After extended discussion and
questioning of Phillips, the IFC
determined to delay action un-
til a later date.

The proposed group would be
composed of one regularly
elected IFC representative from
‘each fraternity plus the frater-
nity, presidents. The Organiza-
tion of Fraternity Presidents
would be dissolved.

SIX COMMITTEES

Six committees would be
formed: Social, Scholarship,
Publicity, Housing, Rush, and
Investigations. Phillips stated
that his primary objective was
a stronger organization,” one
that can make and enforce
rules.” Secondary would be the
elimination of duplications that
now occur from having both an
OFP and an IFC.

Reactions to Phillips’ sugges-
tion were varied. Some were
opposed: ,

— ‘There are nce major con-
flicts now. This seems to be
change for the sake of change.”

— “You mention the desire
for union. And then split the
group into committees. This
doesn’t make sense.”

SUPPORTED BY SOME

Others rallied to the support
of the reorganization:

— “TI like the idea. Students
would assume more authority
and responsibility.”

— “Two representatives from
each fraternity: that’s good.”

The Social Committee would
plan and arrange for dance and

concert weekends taking the
load off the IFC presidents’
shoulders. Bob Waugh, current
IFC president, commented, “1
don't mind the responsibility. 1
enjoy the work. But then some-
one in the future may not.”

Duties of the Scholarship
Committee would range from

activities.

The Rush and Greek Week
group would be responsible for
running as well as studying and
presenting ways of improving
Rush and Greek weeks.

The Housing Committee
would provide systematic liaison
between house managers, house
mothers and the administration.
It would also see that the inter-
ests of each fraternity are up-
held in such things as “general
improvements.”

Causing much discussion was
the proposed Investigations
Committee, composed of the 12
fraternity presidents, which
would review infractions of the
IFC rules and administer pun-
ishments including rushing, s0-
cial and intramural probations.

FC Revises Dates

PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE

consecutive term as Congress-
man from Minnesota's 5th Dis-
trict. He is a nationally recog-
nized authority on U.S. foreign
policy and is a member of the

nificance of what is now hap-
pening in Asia and the Pacific.

nism, it is from his personal
experience of having worked

Committee Plan Davidson Entry

Will Study
Integration

The question of admitting
Negroes to Davidson was re-
ferred to the executive com-
mittee of the Board of
Trustees for study and rec-
ommendation after the
Board heard the results of
both the faculty and stud-
ent polls on integration at
their Wednesday meeting.

The executive committee will
meet before the May meeting of
the Board and may present a
report then. However, no def-
inite time was set for the com-
mittee to report on their study.
The executive committee con-
sists of the president and the
secretary of the trustees, ex
officio, and 14 other members.

President J. McDowell
Richards said that in referring
the matter to the executive
committee rather than to the
special committee that stud-
ied the question before, the
trustees showed that they did
not want simply the same an-
swer. This committee had
recommended three years ago
that the admission of Negroes
to Davidson was not in the
best interests of the college.
Wednesday's action showed
the trustees wanted a new
study of the question, Rich-
ards said.

Prof. W. G. McGavock pre-
sented the trustees the result of
the faculty poll, which showed
53 members in favor of admit-
ting qualified Negroes, 14 a-
gainst, with one member ab-
staining. McGavock also an
swered questions from the
trustees on the faculty poll. The
results of the two day student
poll conducted by the Student
Council and THE DAVIDSON-
IAN, in which 53% of those vot-
ing favored integration, was
presented by President D. G.
Martin.

Some of the trustees ex-
pressed surprise thet only
59% of the students voted.
Richards was not surprised
that the student poll favored
integration. He did, however,
express surprise that the vote
was not more in favor of in-
tegration, as he expleined he
considered Davidson students
te be “well-informed and pro-
gressive.”

There was no discussion of
the admission of Congolese stud-
ents, but Richards said that the
vote to the trustees last year
to allow up to three qualified
Congolese students to enter
Davidson still stood.

In University Center

BY GEORGE HARRINGTON
Davidsonian Staff Writer

_ The Davidson College Trustees held their annual
winter meeting Wednesday. Meeting in two sessions and
one luncheon, the 42 trustees present took action on
several subjects, including Davidson's proposed entry into
the Piedmont University Center and an increase in col-

1ege fees.

The trustees approved the
membership of Davidson in the
Piedmont University Center,
which is being established by
the institutions of higher learn-
ing in the Piedmont area of
North Carolina.

The purpose of this organ-
ization is to foster cooperative
and coordinated effort in con-
nection with visiting scholars,
sponsored research for facul-
ty members, cooperative pro-
fessors, library cooperation,
and artists and lecturers ser-
les.

Based on an experiment first
conceived in Toronto, Canada,
university centers have since
spread from Canada to areas in

Davidson And W.C.
Bands Play Friday

The Davidson College Concert
Band, which recently returned
from a tour of Florida, will join
ranks with the Woman's College
Concert Band from Greensboro
in presenting a free concert at
8:15, Fri., March 2, in the Hod-
son theater of the Cunningham
Fine Arts Center. The combined
bands will repeat the concert
in Greensboro on the night of
March 3.

Dr. Harold Luce of Woman’s
College and Dr. Grier Williams
of Davidson will share conduct-
ing assignments in the program
which will include Bernstein's
Overture to Candide. The Finale
from Dvorak’s New World Sym-
phony, Holst’s “First Suite in
E-flat for Band” and Verdi's
“Nabucco Overture” will also be
ineluded in the concert.

Soloists will be Woman Col-
lege’s Anne Shipwash perform-
ing the first movement of
Haydn’s “Concerto for Trum-
pet” and James Weber playing
“Concertino for Flute” by
Chaminade. The latter selection
was performed on tour by the
Davidson musicians and was
very popular.

The Davidson band was heard
on tour by audiences in St.
Petersburg, Lakeland, Jackson-
ville, Winter Park and Patrick
Air Force Base at Cape Canaver-
al in Florida.

the United States, including At-
Janta and Richmond. Judging by
the activities of the Atlanta
center, the trustees felt that
one in the Piedmont was a good
possibility.

The trustees also approved a
motion to increase room rent
for all dormitories from $170 to
$200 beginning with the 1962-63
school year.

They voted to increase the
tuition and general fee for
members of the Freshman
Class entering next Septem-
ber from $800 to $900, with
another $100 raise to $1000
for the freshmen entering in
September, 1963. These in-
creases will not, however, af-
fect those students presently
enrolled in Davidson.

“Davidson is out of line with
what similar institutions are
charging,” said Dr. J. McDowell
Richards, chairman of the Board
of Trustees. “Those who can
pay should pay.”

However, Dr. Richards indi-
cated that boys with limited
means should still be allowed to
come .to Davidson with the fi-
nancial aid of scholarships and
campus jobs.

In further business, the
trustees appvinted two new
members to the college faculty.

Jesse Clifton Albergotti,

BA (Wheaton College), who
expects his PhD from the
University of North Carolina
in the summer of 1962, was
appointed Assistant Professor
of Physics. Albergotti is a na-
tive of Columbie, S. C.

Eugene Ferrell Miller, BA,
MA (Emory University) and a
candidate for the PhD at the
University of Chicago under the
Committee on Social Studies,
was appointed Instructor in
Political Science. He is a native
of Atlanta, and is a Danforth
Fellow at Chicago.

The trustees also granted sab-
batical leaves of absence to pro-
fessors S. D. Maloney and H. A.
Bryan during 1962-63. Dr. Ma-
loney plans to study at Yale
Divinity School and Dr. Bryan
at the University of London.

Or. R. R. Bernard was also
granted a leave of absence
