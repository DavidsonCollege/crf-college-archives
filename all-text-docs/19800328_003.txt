Conscientious objector status e

By ANDY MILLER
Staff Writer

During this decade each one

of us will probably ask our-
selves the question, ‘‘What do I
believe about war?’ Some peo-
ple find in answering this
question that they are conscien-
tious objectors. Generally, con-
scientious objection is a deep
conviction, motivated by con-
science, that prevents someone
from, taking part in arnied
combat.

Conscientious objectti i is no
longer legally restricted to reli-
gious convictions, and exémp-
tion from military service is
granted to many people with
sincere secular beliefs. Some
say they could not be involved

Livingston Taylor enjoys his life

By ANTHONY EVERMAN
Staff Writer

“Life is really good to me,”
exclaimed Livingston Taylor.
The same enthusiasm that he
exuded in. Room last

entire lifestyle ~~

Taylor’s musical career is
central to him and demands
much of his time. On the road
four days a week, much of his
remaining time is spent prac-
ticing, managing the business
side of his. career and writing
songs. “This is what I. am cut
out to do,” he says as he strings
his guitar.

. Performing before an audi-

ence particularly appeals to
Taylor. ‘‘It’s the greatest to
know all those people come to
see me play. I want to do my
very best.”

He and his wife Maggie live
“outside of Boston.’’ She carves
and sculpts and. helps him write
“a fair number of my songs.”
About 70 percent of the songs
which he performs are his own
compositions. In his spare time
Taylor listens to music of all
types: “I am flexible,’’ he says.
“T enjoy listening to any music
that gives me a buzz.”

He pursues a number of
hobbies. He skis occasionally
and is a regular runner. His
special interest is science, espe-
cially physics and its theory of
gravity. He frequenitly reads
Einstein and not having
enough time to also read fiction.

As might be expected Tay-
lor’s primary interest has al-
ways been music. It has pro-
vided his livelihood since his
graduation from prep school
twelve years ago at the age of
seventeen. His family has been
““very supportive of my musical
career.”

Taylor grew up in Chapel Hill
with his three brothers and one
sister. He is close to his famous
older brother James and they
talk often, but not about their
work. He concludes, “I have my
career, he has his.”” His other
older brother Alex and his sister
Kate are musicians although
not as successful. as he and
James.

Taylor seems to be content
with every aspect of his suc-
cessful career except his celebri-
ty. ‘Visibility can only be
compensated for by money,’’ he
maintains, as he admits to
enjoying his financial sucess.

religious beliefs, are conscien-
tiously opposed to

in war in any form, but who do :
not object to performing non-
combatant duties (such as/being
a medic) in the armed forces.

There are two other types of
conscientious objectors not re-
cognized by law, and these
persons would not be granted
conscientious objector exemp-
tions from military service in a
future draft.if ‘the law remains
the same:

3.Selective Objectors: These
are persons whose consciences
would not permit them to
participate in what they believe
to be an “‘unjust”’ war, but who
could participate in what. they
believe to be a ‘‘just” war. For
example, many people who were
conscientiously opposed to the
Vietnam War because they
believed it was unjust say they
would have fought in World
War If

4.Nuclear Pacifists: These are
persons whose consciences
would not permit them to
participate in a nuclear war, or
what they believe would likely
become a nuclear war. Some
nuclear pacifists are opposed to
all war because of their belief
that any war fought today
‘would lead to the use of nuclear
weapons.

In the past, local draft boards
were the ones who made deci-
sions about granting conscien-
tious. objector status. Under
President Carter’s proposed re-
gistration plan this would re-
main the case. Because it is
difficult to articulate personal
convictions and to prove them,
it is wise for conscientious
objectors to discuss their beliefs
with others and to think about
them in concrete terms. Once a
person has been drafted, he has
only ten days to present his case
as a conscientious objector.

In order to help individuals
substantiate a claim ds a con-
scientious objector, several in-
dependent agencies have been
formed which will keep a CO
file. Two of these groups are the -

Facts indicate that you may work in

unusual to make changes as you go. And
it’s entirely possible that your final career

responsibility is limited to a desk and

But when your first $51 is an Army

experience. You’!l be in charge. On a
specific job assignment, you could have 30
to 40 people working for you. And you could
be responsible for millions of dollars in.

Responsibility for people and

seek. It’s a margin of difference in the
increasingly competitive job market.
