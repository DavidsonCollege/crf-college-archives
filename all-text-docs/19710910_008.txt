Summer plans !to renovate
the Carolina Inn, the Grey
House, Erwin Lodge, Cannon
Hall and Duke Dormitory
were for the most part com-
plete as the first day of
classes began this year.

The Carolina Inn (also
known as the Helper Hotel
or the Old Inn) was remod-
eled to resemble its nine-
teenth century «appearance
as much as possible, but its
function is to provide mod-
ern facilities for the honors
college.

Dean of the Honors Col-
lege Frontis W. Johnston has
already moved into the build-
ing, and other professors
working in the honors pro
gram are in the process of
transferring to their new of-
fices.

In addition to the offices
downstairs, the building in-
cludes a large lounge-dining
area, a fully-equipped kitch-
en, a guest suite for visiting
professors associated with
the honors prognam, and
three seminar rooms up-
stairs.

The Carolina Inn was orig-
inally built as a home in
1837, and changed hands for
various uses until the college
purchased it in 1946.

The cost of the work is es-
timated. at $75,000, part of
which is covered by a grant
from the Surdna Foundation.
The renovation was suppos-
ed to be completed by Sep-
tember 1, but some work on
the exterior remains to be
finished.

The Grey House, across

from the President’s home

on Main Street, was also re-
modeled ito preserve the
classic Georgian architectur-
al style in which it was ori-
ginally fashioned.

Work on the house is com-
plete, and at present it is
occupied-by 11 Davidson co-
eds. The building is furnish-
ed with living facilities for
14 women, with baths, a
lounge, and limited kitchen
equipment.

Erwin Lodge, once a popu-
lar meeting hall for commun-
ity activities, was restored
this summer also, and it
lacks only a few light fix-
tures before completion.

pick up their luncheon tick-
ets by September 15 from

fice,’ said Scott.

Coeds Seek “Living Experiences

By RUSS MERRITT

A variety of living exper
iences, a different education-
al perspective, and ‘‘just
plain fun” are the major rea-
sons for the presence of Da-
vidson’s female exchange
students, according to the 11
coeds.

Ten of the women are here
under the Eight-College Ex-
change Program, operated in
conjunction with three men’s
and four women’s schools in
Virginia. The other coed is
a participant in tthe newly in-
itiated Queens-Davidson ex-
change program.

**We've been in convents all
our lives, so we’ve decided to
come to a monastery for a
year,’ commented Grange
Roller, a junior from Mary
Baldwin. ‘‘Davidson offers a

totally new and different
environment for going to
school.”

*‘We wanted a change, and
we honestly wanted to have
some fun,” Bobbie Black-
wood, a Hollins junior, said.
*‘We didn’t come here just be-
cause it’s an all-male school.
Rather, we came _ because
it’s not all-girl.”

The coeds all agreed that
they decided to come to Da-
vidson because it is very dif-
ferent from their previous
educational experiences. ‘‘We
wanted to get away from ar-
tificial sexual segregation,
from superficial dating atti-
tudes, and from the super-
ficial dating situation. We
want to be itreated as people

» for once,” one coed stated.

Mary Baldwin, like David-
son a school affiliated with
the Presbyterian Church, is
by far the best represented
of the five schools sending
coeds. Juniors Roller, Mar-
tha Taylor, Sandy May, Lin-

di Leuders and Cathy Cross
all are Baldwia students, as
are sophomorcs Jennet Rob-
inson and Marie Ferrara.

Blackwood is the only Hol-
las lepresemative, while
Jane Farrar is the only coed
from Randolph-Macon Wom-
an’s. Mimi Bain is the sole
Sweet Briar student, and Kay
Behrens is the only coed
from Queens.

The coeds have been amus-
ed by the second glances and
outright stares they’ve re-
ceived. “Sure, there’s a lot
of staring going on, but we
expected it,” Roller said.
“After all, we’re a handful

of girls on an all-male cam-
pus.”

“There’s staring going on
both ways, I think,” one co-
ed said, ‘We're watching the
Davidson students watch us.”

Blackwood said she was
wary when she first reached
the Davidson campus, and
several others shared her
feelings. “I didn’t” really
know what to expect, and I
didn’t want everyone staring
at me as a thing.”

All the coeds seemed to
agree that the majority of
the Davidson student body
probably views them as hus-
band-hunters. According to

BUT ee 8 .

Coeds inspect bicycle repairs.

one coed, such an attitude
toward the few women stu-

dents is unfortunate ‘‘be-
cause we're net hunting
mates and we don't want

our experiences here to be
limited by such a view.”

The coeds all say they are
favorably impressed by Da-
vidson. “I can’t understand
why more girls don’t come
here on tthis program,” Rob-
inson said.

“The campus is beautiful,
and the students have been
extremely nice,” May said.
“TI get the feeling that some
are even nervous around
us.”
