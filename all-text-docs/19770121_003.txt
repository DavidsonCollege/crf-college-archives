Do,bra-burning, radical and
revolutionary women attend
Davidson College?

No, declare a newly organi-
zed group on campus called
Women At Davidson (WAD)
who convened at the Union
this week to discuss women’s

adjustment problems on cam-
pus.

WAD was formed by a
small group of coeds who
thought these problems need-
ed to be brought to the surface
and shared.

The group had formerly
been meeting at North Main
House, but moved onto cam-
pus this week so its discus-
sions would receive more wide-
spread attention.

Senior Ruth Murphy defines
WAD as a ‘‘way to handle

Spring enriched by six from

This spring term Davidson
College will host six
British men and women to be
designated as Dean Rusk
Scholars.

These students are candi-
dates for Oxford or Cambridge
University from the St. Paul’s
Schools in London.

Davidson College President
Samuel R. Spencer, Jr. said
that the program ‘“‘honors
Dean Rusk in a rather appro-
priate way because of his
Rhodes Scholarship at Oxfork
and his work in foreign af-
fairs.”’

Spencer explained that Bri-
tish students who are candi-
dates for Oxford and Cam-
bridge spend a year after their
secondary schooling preparing
for their entrance into the
university.

As part of their preparation,
many students travel and
encounter new educational ex-
periences. The six that come
to Davidson will be using part
of their time for that purpose.

The students that will be-
come Rusk Scholars at David-
son were recommended by the
schools in England.

This year’s program, which
includes four men and two
women, is a pilot project but
Spencer anticipates that it will
become a regular addition to

problems instead of just com-
plaining.”’ She likes it because
she can ‘‘share personal exper-
iences with a group that cares
about me as a woman.”

Senior Van Williamson fur-
ther stated that WAD is not
an encounter group, but an
issue-oriented organization
open to everyone.

WAD plans to discuss and
invite guests to speak or
issues of sexuality, fear of

immediate advantages for the
college,’’ Spencer pointed out.

“Tt increases the number of
international students on cam-
pus during the spring term
and_it will build over the years
a group of people in England
who are acquainted with Da-
vidson.

“These people will offer us
valuable contacts, and they
will be among the ablest
people of their generation,’’ he
added.

Spencer indicated that the
program would cost the col-
lege very little. The students
will be housed in rooms that
are normally vacant during
the spring term and the stu-
dents will have to pay for their
own eating arrangements as
well as their own transporta-
tion. The college is, however,
providing them with free tui-
tion.

The St. Paul’s Schools are
among the oldest public
schools in England. It should
be noted that in Britain a
“public’’ school is what Am-
ericans would consider a
private school.

The St. Paul Schools are
two separate institutions, one
for men and the other for

supporter for such a house,
gave reasons for establishing
an all-female house.

“An all-girl eating house is
not to unify the girls against
the males, but to give an
outlet for them to be toget-
her.”’

Wright stressed that al-
though not all girls would eat
at the house it would be
organized and operated to
include every girl on campus.

She said that the house
would not become like a soro-
rity because its main focus
would center on females rela-
ting with themselves, ins+2ad
of simply attracting males.

Cathy Landis disagreed:
The house might become clo-
ser than the others and ex-
clude those who needed a wo-
men’s center on campus.” She
feels that an all-female house
would lead to more trends to-
ward dating, instead of impro-
ving relations among females.

Murphy stressed a need for
activities at Davidson that
support and unify women.
“There is a lack of unity
among the females at David-

son. It’s hard to relate be-
tween girls with so many guys

around,”’ she said.
