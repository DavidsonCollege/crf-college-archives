Mail Drop For Union

Last year the majority of the student body did not appear
overwhelmingly in favor of establishing a full-scale post office
in the College Union, though a straw vote conducted by the
Davidsonien toward the end of the school year showed that
there was considerable student support for such a move.

This ballot, however, was not a complete census of the
opinion because many people did not vote. At that time some
voices were raised, questioning the practicality of setting up
such a post office.

There seems to be considerable grounds for belief that
the nearness of the Davdson P. O. makes the need for another
one in the Union very slight. Aside from this considerable
confusion in receiving mail would almost certainly result for
a time, at least.

In addition, from what we have heard, the arrival of mail
at a Union post office would be slower and less frequent than
at the downtown office.

These factors might tend to make a Union Post Office
less attractive to the student body as a whole.

We believe what would best serve our present needs,
and would be considerably less expensive to set up and
operate, would be a mail drop located near the information
desk at the entrance of the Union.

Outgoing mail could be picked up here several times
per day, and students would be saved a longer walk to the
downtown post office just to mail a letter. .

The difficulties entailed in setting up mail drop service
at the Union would be negligible since there is already a mail
slot located near the desk, which was obviously intended for
just such a purpose.

There seems to be little reason why the facilities already
available could not be put into immediate use. The usefulness
gained would certainly far outweigh the effort spent.

P

Coftee, Sugar Bowls, Etc.

Previously in this column we have extolled the maturity
of the Davidson student, and elsewhere on this page the al-
leged paternal attitude of the college has been attacked.

Recently, however, a situation has developed in the College
Union which could in time, and in part, refute our contention
of maturity, and give factual evidence to those who say that
if the college is paternalistic, it is through necessity rather
than choice.

Now, the depositing of chewing gum, cigarette ashes
and coffee and other liquids in the sugar dishes of the cafe-
teria and snack bar may seem to be a rather trifling thing.
But it is just because it is such a trifling thing that it is de-

plorable.

Certainly we cannot denounce such conduct as an in-
famous attack upon the Union or the college as a whole. It
seems likely that these pranks are the result of thoughtless-
ness and a sense of humor that is something less than fully
developed. Without making a mountain out of a molehill we
might point out the fact that the willful spoiling and need-
less waste of sugar in the dining area of the Union is using
up to 80 pounds of sugar per day, the cost of which will event-
ually have to be passed on in advanced prices if these condi-
tions continue.

It might also be mentioned in passing that pouring cof-
fee into sugar bowls simply for the estatic pleasure derived
hardly speaks well for the wit and intelligence of the student
body as a whole, not to mention the few individuals invoived
or the cost to the Union.

“All The News...”

In the orientation edition of The Davidsonian we tried
to make it clear to the students entering Davidson that the
newspaper is a student publication designed to voice things
of interest to those connected with the college.

The staff makes a real effort to get at least the major
part of the college news that is “fit to print.” Without the
direct contributions of the students, however, this is virtually
impossible. Things happen around the campus every week
that are of interest to large segments of the student body,
yet many of these things fail to reach The Davidsonian.

We want to request, therefore, that if you feel there is
news coming from your student organization that we are fail-
ing to get, bring us a run-down on it and we will put it in
print. News articles, letters to the editor, or even occasional
features, if they are of general or lasting interest, are wel-

come.

Articles turned in by Wednesday night of each week
at the Davidsonian office in the College Union will be printed
in that week’s paper. The Davidsonian is your newspaper, and
it is your privilege, if not your responsibility, to use it—H.B.

Entered as second class matter at the Post Office at Davidson,
N. C., under the Act of March 8, 1607.

One of the largest operations in
Davidson history was successfully
completed last Sunday as the deni-
zens of both East and Duke Dor-
mitories moved back into their
rooms in the wake of some 350
damsels who occupied them over
the weekend.

“Operation Sack," as conceived
and executed by Dormitory Super-
visor Mrs. R. A. Little, was proba-
bly the only logical solution to
last weekend's problem of having
many more girls than the private
homes in town could take care of.
It was old stuff to the residents of
Duke to have to move out, but the
boys in East squawked more than
somewhat when they heard the
news that they were to vacate for
the weekend. At least one guy, it
is known, moved from Rumple to
East this year for the express pur-
pose of avoiding having to move
out on IFC dance weekends.

By using East instead of Rumple
this year space was found for many
more girls, and if the occupants
of that dorm hadn't agreed to move
out, chances are Mrs. Little's hand-
some gray hair would have been
standing on end by Friday after-
noon.

The following is an article en-
titled “Fire! Fire!” which we found
printed in a Davidsonian dated in
October of the early twenties. We
feel it our duty to present this
work for the edification and in-
tellectual enrichment of the pres-
ent student body: Also we feel that
the magnificent expressing and
flowing style herein is unsurpassed
to this day in the creative writ-
ing of the Davidson men. A few
editorial remarks have been in-
serted in order to clear up certain
rather obscure passages:

Shhh! A rumor has been spread
abroad in the camp. A wild rumor
indeed. "Twas started by a wild
dreamer of dreams residing in the

then!) domicile of Rumple. He
dreamed of a conference with...

Queens College. (Here comes trou-

much logical proof (This is a Da-
vidson man) on the part of the
dreamer, said the president was
convinced and gave consent to the
proposition of a special train
for the girls to visit Davidson on
Homecoming Day, October 2ist.

was looking bright for the dream-

powers that be in an effort to get
those Queen girls up here on Octo-
ber 2ist. Say wouldn't it be great
to meet a train-load

No mention has been made yet
in print of the fact that the deco-

ancient umbrella idea of streamers
coming down from the top of the
gym to the sides.

So, along with other IFC mem-
bers, the canopy for the bandstand
was dreamed up, and streamers
were placed down the sides as
usual. Another unusual feature,
however, was the placement of
several spotlights on the band-
stand, which added greatly to the
overall effectiveness of the deco-
rations arrangement.

The IFC is anxious to hear stu-
dent comment on the new look in
dance decorations. If the new look
was appreciated, they’d like to
know; if it wasn't liked—well, they
aim to please.

An interesting sidelight on the
Homecoming Weekend was Band-

the Saturday afternoon concert that
in the twelve years he’s had a
band, he’s always been invited to
Davidson. Just as good if not better
than ever this year, Charlie seems
to grow mellow without becoming

Dear Dr. Cunningham:

Again, Davidson has made a
most generous contribution to the
Blood Program, maintaining its
standard as having the largest per-
centage of donors as a group in
Mecklenburg County. The accumu-
lative record of donors from Da-
vidson is one in which you and the
students should feel great pride.
The collection of 347 pints on Octo-
ber 8 and 9 brings the total to
2,690 since October 1950.

Colonel Davis and the YMCA
Cabinet deserve special recogni-
tion for the splendid recruitment
job done for the October visit. Al-
though they were disappointed in
falling short of the 492 and 402
collections made in December and

OFF-MOORINGS:

A pilaster state, filled with plas-
ter people, who are housed in plas-
ter homes are the Californians of
today. It is the New America, this
vastly growing Southern California
that is drawing its picture across
the pages of our times as purely
as the Norther part of the state
did in the gold dust days of the
mid-nineteenth century.

California grows more cotton
than any other state except Texas.
She has the fastest growing pop-
ulation of any state in the Union.
There are more cars per capita in
this, the second largest of the
forty-eight states, and more paved
roads in her boundaries than in
any other state, bar none. She is
the second richest state and has
probably the highest standard of
living of any.

Let us look then at the future
America, for it is here that she
is growing fastest economically and
sociologically, and it is here that
many of the trends in American
living and thought are develop-
ing.

Davidsonian Abroad?

This summer I had occasion to
live in California for two months
and thus have some cause for
knowing of whence I speak. Some
may think I am copying last year’s
column “Davidsonian Abroad;”
others may say I'm introducing a
“Davidsonian Abawdy” element to
the paper. Let us look at Cali-
fornia.

There are many interesting as-
pects to this state and one could
write for days about each one—
the automobile situation, the high-
ways, the philosophy of the peo-
ple, places to visit in and around
Los Angeles, the religion of the
people, comparing the West to the
East, the women in the West and
how different they are from East-
ern and Southern belles, the
curious weather, the civilizing of
nature that is done, the manner
of living of the Californians, and
many others.

Any particular civilization or
any one part is to electric to dis-
sect and understand in so short

(Because the problems dis-
cussed are often raised here
at Davidson, the Davidsenian
is reprinting an article from
the New York Times about
Yale University.)

Since the end of World War II
institutions of higher learning in
this country have undergone an ex-
tensive . self-evaluation of their
goals, aims and objectives. The
war itself, followed by the influx
of veterans to the nation’s cam-
puses and the demands of chang-
ing world conditions since the war,
caused many colleges and universt-
tles to reconsider their academic
programs and map out new plans
for future.

Last week another milestone in
this educational analysis took
place when Yale University issued
a sixty-page report prepared by
its Committee on General Educa-
tion.

The Yale report proposes, in ef-
fect, a clean break with the exist-
ing undergraduate college pro-
gram. The committee makes this
basis suggestion: Let us pay less
attention to the extra-curriculum
—developing educated, critical-
minded, sound-thinking men and
women.

The suggestions presented by the
Yale committee are radical. There
are two programs: the first, a
transitional one, to develop a
stronger undergraduate course for
the freshman and sophomore years;
the second, a permanent plan that

terns, return to a larger degree, to
the system used at Oxford and
Cambridge. The student would be
treated as a thinking, independent
individual. His would be the re-
sponsibility to study. He would not
be prodded and pushed into an
education nor be spood fed.

The Yale committee takes to
task “student immaturity” as ex-
pressed in overemphasis upon ex-
tra curricular activities. A whole
community of students finds its
academic work secondary in com-
parison with such “important”
items as sports or the college news-
paper. Not that the activities are
in themselves a sign of immaturity,
the report hastens to explain. But

look at a few quick impressions.
Rare Animals

A rare animal indeed to find in
California today is a native-born
person there. Everyone, it seems,
came in and a remarkable number
have done so_in the last thirteen
years or so. The phenomenal
growth in population of the Los
Angeles area has been due to a
great number of contributing fac-
tors. The greatest of these have
been the heavy and rapid indus-
trialization caused largely by the
War, the development of old and
new military bases in the South-
land, the movement of many of
the aircraft plants to the Coast,
the appealing climate, the attrac-
tions that the new economy have
and the easy assimilation into the
social system of new comers.

There’s a saying about Califor-
nians—"Everyone’s a hustler.” Its
true that more than a few seem
overly motivated by materialistic
designs and have grown literally
dollar-mad. The quirk of the thing
is that they have seen so many
get-rich-quick schemes succeed that
each person is constantly on the
look-out for the end of his rain-
bow.
Aldous Huxley paints a vivid
and realistic picture of the Cali-
fornians in his book of the early
forties, “After Many a Summer
Dies the Swan.” He reveals the
genuine ungodliness, the super-
ficiality, and the far-reaching ef-
fects that continued materialism
has on people. Huxley is a genius,
and Ill second him one on the
Californians.

Sunshine Religion

In what is reputed to be the
largest Presbyterian (U.S.A.)
Church in this country, one would
expect to find one of the country’s
best expressions‘ of religion. Hol-
lywood’s sunshine philosophy of
constant pursuit of personal pleas-
ure and personal gain finds some
of its best expressions in the
Church's fifteen ministers.

Hollywood, with its emphasis on
sex, money, and al] its other ma-
terialistic values has so much
stained the character of the entire
culture that the pursuit of ego-
tistical pleasures are set up as the
highest aim on this earth and the

a majority of the students puts
second things first—and the effect
of this type of student preoccupa-
tion is at times “both insidious
and cummulative.” Immaturity is
defined as a failure to recognize
the importance of the work which
stands at the center of college life.

“This immaturity has many con-
tributing causes — the adolescent
compulsion to go the way of the
crowd, for instance, rather than
the individual way of learning,”
the report says.

What does Yale want? To pre-
pare men with the power to make
judgements about complex sub-
jects and to present those judge-

ments coherently and precisely.

For, ssys the committee, if Yale
produces graduates who know all
about Spenser or Bismarck, eco-
nomics or chemistry, but precious
little about the disciplined use of
the mind, it cannot honestly claim
to call them educated.

The Yale committee stresses the
émportance of mastering the great
areas of knowledge, defined here
as the natural sciences and math-
ematics, the social sciences, his-
tory and the arts. It is essential,
the committee holds, to establish
a concept which will provide the
undergraduste with intellectual
development in a broad and not
merely a technical sense.

As its immediate aim, the Yale
committee would modify the pres-
ent curriculum. This plan assumes
a five-course program each year
for the first two years. Superior
High school juniors would be ad-
mitted, so that in some instances
the eight-year high school-college
course becomes a seven-year pro-
gram. In essence, the plan pleads
for an education which is “con-
tinuous rather than fragmented,
co-ordinated rather than merely se-
quential.” '

The ultimate goal would be a
fer more drastic break with the
present curriculum. Instead of a
day-to-day or week-to-week con-
cern over the work of the students,
the faculty would place greater re-
sponsibility on the men who come
to their classes. At the end of the
first two years each student would
get a genera) examination, based

obvious reward for professing faith
in Christianity as well.

An unusual situation has arisen
in this way, for many of the same
rewards are promised both the
Christian and he who pursues his
own personal end.

Pleasure is All

The people support, believe and
live the philosophy of personal
pleasure. Las Vegas has been
described by another Davidsonian
who also recently saw it, as the
antipathy of Davidson—no facade,
no pretense, no hypocrisy—it is
sin, vice and voluptiousness. As
well the place actually goes to a
great deal of trouble and expense
to tell you as much.

The two cities of the plain—
Reno and Las Vegas — have
flourished in the postwar era as
they never did before and their
meteoric rise seems destined to
continue. Las Vegas, the one J saw,
is called my many, “Lost Wages,”
but be that as it may, when we
entered the town at 3:30 one June
morning, it was so well-stocked
with hopeful gamblers that we
hed trouble finding a parking
place.

Another favorite place of win-
ing, dining and dancing for the
Californians is the Sunset Strip in
North Hollywood. We took in one
night the Mocambo—a beautifully
over-decorated, over-filled, over-
rated night club—where Joann
Gilbert was singing.

The San Fernando Valley holds
Studio City and a place called
Larry Potter's Supper Club. I sup?
pose a few people were eating sup-
per that late at night, but mostly
it was the attraction of LiLi St.
Cyre that kept them there.

California is certainly far-re-
moved from the Davidson way of
life in many ways and its social
structure is far from our ideas. It
is the pioneering America, still
molding, still growing, and going
through its inevitable growing
pains in the process. Perhaps some-
day it will have its Davidson based
on the traditions of a past: half.

Presbyterianism, on the semi-celi-
bate life—not today.

Maps Out New Plans For University’s Future

on the work that he has taken.

There would be no compulsory
attendance or regulations so far
as the lectures were concerned.
Of course—and here is the nub of
this drastically different approach
to learning—if the student just
loafed through the first two years,
there would be no third or fourth
year for him. Failure on the ex-
amination would mean, for the
most part, dismissal from the uni-
versity.

Under the new program, learn-
ing would become continuous and
meaningful. Students would not
be concerned with grades, credits
of cramming. They would be more
concerned with gaining a sound
knowledge in the important
branches of living.

The Yale plan comes as the cli-
max of a series of plans and
studies that has appeared period-
ically during the last ten years.
Nor is the end yet .in sight.

The University of Chicago pio-
neered in these etiucational
changes. Under former Chancellor
Robert M. Hutchins, Chicago in-
augurated a broad revision of its
undergraduate program in 1981
and extended it in 1042. Dean F.
Champion Ward of the University
of Chicago, commenting on the
Yale plan, observed that “it’s good
to have such- distinguished com-
pany after all these years.”

Dr. Ward pointed out that Chi-
cago has instituted comprehensive
examination to replace course
credit and has adopted integrated
courses of a year to three years in
length, covering the chief areas of
knowledge. Also, he said, the Chi-
cago plan calls for selected read-
ings and syllabic as course ma-
terials, teaching by the diseussion
method in small classes, accelera-
tion of students through placement
tests, ability to progress aecord-
ing to achievement, and volontary
class attendance. The emphasig at
Chieago has been on the student's
ability to make sound and relevant
judgments, to think and to think
