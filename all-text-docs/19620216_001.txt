L. MENDEL RIVERS preaches the old time religion — he’s
for “the American individual.”

Rivers Sings Blues
For Reds And Whites

BY BILL RUTH
Davidsonian Feature Editor

Early this week a U.S. Congressman stepped from
the pages of Advise and Consent to air his political views
on the Davidson campus. The protagonist in question
was the Hon. L. Mendel Rivers, U.S. Representative from

Ch

Secretary Of

Charleston, S. C.

“He is the epitome of what
people in the North consider to
be the typical Southern Con-
' gressman,” stated a Davidson
Student from New Jersey. Rivers
did indeed give such an appear-
ance. His long white hair comb-
ed straight back, and his navy-
blue suit and white tie combin-
ed to suggest a man of venerar
bility and political savoir faire.

SEEK DIRECT ANSWERS

At the coffee hour following
River’s speech in Chapel, stud-
ents began immediately to fire
pointed questions at the con-
* gresaman, seeking direct an-
swers.

“What do you think about the
John Birch Society?” Conser-
vative-minded Rivers answered:
“] positively won't say anything
about it. I’m no more for the
J.B.S. than I am for the A.D.A.”

But Rivers had come to Dav-
idson a professed conservative

SpringTour
Scheduled
For Chorus

The Davidson Male Chorus
will leave for its annual tour on
March 23. This year the Chorus
will travel through southeastern
United States into Texas and
Oklahoma. The trip will end on
April 1 with a program in Au-
burn, Alabama.

Since all of the final arrange-
ments have not been made, Prof.
Donald Plott, the director of the
group, says it is impossible to
list all of the stops on the tour.
However, there is speculation
among the members of the
Chorus that Mexico may be in-
cluded.

Along the way, the Chorus
will sing for varied audiences,
from college student bodies to
church congregations. Conse-
quently, the music being per-
formed will vary, with selections
ranging from old English ballads
to sacred anthems. A featured
part of some of the programs
will be the performance of parts
of Randall Thompson's Testa-
ment of Freedom, which they
will also sing with Rise Stevens
and the Charlotte Symphony
earlier in the spring.

Aside from the concert with
Miss Stevens, the group will sing
for the Charlotte Civic Club at
a banquet featuring Secretary
of State Dean Rusk. On March
19, the Chorus will appear with
the Agnes Scott Choir here at
Davidson.

and most of the early questions
were along this line of thought.
“So far all conservatives seem
to be Southerners,” began an-
other student. ‘What do you de-

fine conservatism as?" To this

Rivers replied with the laconic
phrase: “I don’t know.”
BIRCH SOCIETY

“People who claim to be in
the Birch society seem to be
pretty nice people,” stated the
congressman when pressed to
a definate stand on the subject
of rightist groups.

Rivers was complimentary to
his conservative fellow travelers,
although he seemed to disagree
with questioning students as to
who was on his band wagon and
who was not. “Fulton Lewis—
he's a good man. I don’t know
him, but he’s a good man.”

“As far ag 1 know, Walter
Judd ig no conservative.”

“]’m supporting America with
everyone going my way,” con-
tinued Rivers. “To decide what
is American I let my intuition
guide me.”

Present at the questioning
session was Hannah Miller of
The Charlotte Observer. “You're
a pretty gal,” said Rivers, “and
pretty gals have always been
able to get everything I have.”

Miss Miller's questioning con-
tinued.

“T usually answer from the
abundance of my ignorance,”
stated the congressman before
answering her next question.

FOR THE RECORD

—On the topic of resuming
atmospheric nuclear tests: ‘‘Ab-
solutely.”

—Are taxes too high? “Posi-
tively.”

—Have times changed since
the era of Abe Lincoln? ‘Defin-
ately. We have TV.”

“Bverybody has two cars and
God knows how many TV's. I’ve
got four and I don’t even watch
TV, except for something classi-
cal like Andy Griffith.”

—On the possibility of drop-
ping tariffs and encouraging
free trade: “That's going to be
quite a thing, because I believe
Common Market is tied up with
that thing.”

As lunch time grew nearer
Rivers expressed his desire to
get the U.S. out of the UN.,
purge the communists from the
clergy, overhaul the tax struc-
ture and blockade Cuba.

—In the Congo: “Tsombe is
the only one of those mancaters
I trust.”

The Davidson College
Board of Trustees will con-
vene on campus next Wed-
nesday, Feb. 21, for their
midwinter meeting, which
will be highlighted by an
address by Secretary of
State Dean Rusk in Char-
lotte.

Although a specific agenda is
never released by the board
prior to the actual meeting, busi-
ness will generally consist of
several committee reports, and
a report to the board by college
President D. Grier Martin.

The specific contents of
President Martin’s report are
being withheld until the board
meets, but he will discuss
matters of current interest to
the board about the - college,
its educational program, and
any progress, changes, and
improvements in any facet of
the college’s program.

The board will definitely be
presented with the results of
the faculty and student polls
calling for integration, and some
action is expected regarding in-
tegration of the college.

Other matters the board is ex-
pected to take up include the
proposed change in cut policy,
the approval of honorary de-
grees, any faculty changes for
next year such as sabbatical
leaves, and a report on the col-
lege curriculum and financial
situation.

Ordinarily the board would
conclude its February meet-
ing sometime in the afternoon,
but this year the majority of
the board members will be
spectel guests of the Charlotte
Chamber of Commerce the
night of Feb. 21 et a dinner
featuring the speech by Rusk.

The topic of Rusk’s talk has
pot yet been released by the
State Department, but he is ex-
pected to make a major policy
address on the world situation.

Sig Eps
Win IFC
Trophy

The Sigma Phi Epsilon pledge
class won the Interfraternity
Council trophy for the moet out-
standing pledge class of 1961-62.
The trophy was presented to
the fraternity group this week.

Second place in the competi-
tion went to the pledges of Beta
Theta Pi, and the Sigma Chi
freshmen were in third place.

The Sig Ep group was the
rather obvious first place win-
ners, according to Fraternity
Liaison Officer John Kuyken-
dall. The award was based on
pledge class rankings in the
Homecoming decoration contest,
the pledge project competition
and skit night as well as pledge
class grade averages. The Sig
Eps had earlier placed first in
all four areas.

Judging the competition over
the semester were professors
Tom Clark, Charles Ratliff and
Bill McGavock and Kuykendall.
The professors had each been
chairman of committees judging
competition in the individual
areas.

“I thought the Sig Eps had as
good or better pledge class pro-
gram as any on campus both
from a week to week standpoint
and for the whole semester,”
Kuykendall said. “A careful
pledge-planning committee did
a terrific job.”

Senior Ken Moore was pledge
trainer for the winners, while
Bob Graham served as president
of the pledge class. Warren
Stevens is the fraternity presi-
dent.

Competition was much closer
for the second and third places.
The Betas had placed second in
the skit night and class project
contests, while the Sigma Chi’s
were third in skit night with a
high scholarship average and
high rated project.

meeting, the question under
heaviest discussion was to de-
cide if a student would be al-
lowed to vote a partial ballot
without his ballot being de-
clared void. By an 8-3 vote the
Council decided that in cases
where more than one person
is to be elected to the same
post, a voter may cast votes
up to and including the num-
ber of candidates to be elect-
ed.

may nominate Student Council
officers for 1962-63. The presi-

will come from the rising Sopho-
more Class. All students may
nominate any eligible student
for any of the Student Council
offices. The voting will be held
Wednesday, Feb. 28-Friday,

ble to vote.

than three men will be left

Pre-Dance Virus
Threatens Campus

The flu bug hit the campus
this week, reviving memories of
the “lost weekend” of 1957, in
which the Homecoming festivi-
ties were cancelled,

The latest rash of cases is not
nearly as scrious, however. Dr.
J. B. Woods, college physician,
said that approximately 45-50
students have been to the infir-
mary for treatment. Beds have
been set up in Chambers base-
ment in case the infirmary be-
comes too crowded, but as yet,
these facilities have not been
needed.

Dr. Woods advised students
who have the classic symptoms
of a cold, fever and general
aching to report to the infirm-
ary for treatment. He noted that
this should be done both for the
student’s own good and to pre-
vent the spreading of the virus.

Dr. Woods further advised
students “not to panic and lis-
ten to wild rumors that are cir-
culating.” He recommended that
students get as much rest as

members of The Observer and {possible during the dance week-

The Charlotte News’ staffs.

mined by keeping the candi-
dates with the majority of
votes on the next day’s bel-
lots.

Election results, including
the vote count, will be post-
ed in both the College Union
and Chambers as soon after the
closing of the polls as possible.
THE DAVIDSONIAN will carry
the vote count on the Friday
after voting for a particular of-
fice has ended.

The nominations for the var-
ious offices will be conducted
from the floor in chapel in writ-

A list of the candidates nomin-

expected arrival time of 11 p.m.

The group, traveling in three
Cadillacs, is to have a police
