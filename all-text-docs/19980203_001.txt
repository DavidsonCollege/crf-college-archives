The Residence Life Office will
use the lottery system for housing again
this year, but students will notice some
changes.

RLO, in response to student com-
plaints and advice, will shorten the
length of the process and allow seniors
access to lottery numbers before Phase
1.

Traditionally, the lottery system
was divided into three “phases.” ~Dur-
ing Phase 1, seniors received Martin
Court Apartments. Phase 2 concerned
seniors who had not received an apart-
ment during Phase 1, rising juniors, and
Patterson Court Apartments. RLO also
processed requests to live off-campus
during the second phase. Finally, Phase
3 was Open Lottery Night, where stu-
dents assembled in Chambers to choose
the remaining rooms, including single
rooms.

Lottery numbers one-500 are as-
signed to seniors; numbers 501-1000
are given to juniors; and numbers 1 001-
1500 are left for sophomores.

The process began-in January and
ended in April; with each phase sepa-
rated by approximately three-week in-
terludes. ‘Assistant Director of Resi-
dent Life Dee Jordan said she had re-
ceived complaints from students that
the process was too long.

“We heard comments from stu-

dents can pick up any application for
anything on Feb. 11.”

Open Lottery Night will be held
Mar. 25, keeping the entire process
within two months. “Basically, we
have combined Phases 2 and 3,” said
Jordan.

In Phase 1, seniors still choose

“(The process) starts later,” said
Jordan, “so that students who need to
dispute their class status and get their
accounts with the Controller’s Office
settled have time to do so,” Previously,

tionable class status could not pick up

has posted stu-

dents,” said Jordan, “that it was stress-
ful to have the process drawn out so
long and to not know (their housing
status).” Also, Jordan said that the
length of the process and the uncer-
tainty made it difficult for students who
were trying to secure off-campus hous-
ing.

In response, RLO has condensed
this process. “In the past,” said Jordan,
“students had to keep up with what
dates you could pick up the applica-
tions.” To reduce this confusion, “stu-

live off-campus will be processed, and
single room applications will be ac-
cepted.

Phase 2 will include the remaining
Martin Court Apartments, Patterson
Court Apartments, the second round for
single rooms and off-campus permis-
sion, and Open Lottery Night.

The acceptance of single room
applications was moved up to Phase |
so that students who know they want
singles do not have to wait until Open

places, including the Union and their

Residence Hall.

Beginning this year, seniors will
also have access to their lottery num-
bers before Phase 1. RLO had declined
to release these lottery numbers in the
past, preferring that students decide their
roommates regardless of lottery num-
bers. (To determine the group lottery
number, the lottery numbers of the
roommates are added together.)

mittee recommended that RLO release
these numbers, leaving students to deal
with potential problems themselves.

RLO hopes students find the re-
vised lottery system less confusing and
less stressful. In addition, a booklet
concerning the new system and fre-
quently asked questions is in the pro-
cessing of being published.

“We haven’t drastically. changed
the system,” said Jordan,“ but we've
condensed it and simplified it.”

For rising sophomores who have
yet to experience the lottery process,
RLO wants their first experience to be
as positive and relaxed as possible. “It
is my hope, and the department’s hope,”
said Jordan, “that students will find (the
process) more user-friendly.”
