Point System...

So many colleges and universities use &
point system or its equivalent that it is a
wonder that the possibility of its use on the
campus has not been more seriously con-
sidered.

We have been told that the loeal chapter
of Omicron Delta Kappa had a point system
by which its members were once chosen.
However, no matter how useful an O.D.K.
point system maybe, the need of a campus |
point system is much more important and
urgent,

Without.a doubt, some men have too much
to do in the wature of extra-curricular ac-
tivity. They admit it. They say without
hesitation that they.could have done some of
their jobs better ii they had had less on
their shoulders. A student is not often the
best judge of how much he can handle. He*
does not always realize how much effort and
work his position on the campus will entail.

A student takes more iterest in campus

affairs if he believes he is plaving a vital pact
im their aecivity, The responsibility is good
ior him and consequentiy good jor the
school, through his etiori-—Hy a point sys-
tem, more men wottld hold responsible posi-
tions on the camptts.
. Thus, every organization on the campus
would be more’active, due to a more toncen-
trated activity of those who feel the re-
sponsibility and have the time to bear it.
If you must revert to campus spirit, fine in
itself but trite as to phrascology, nothing
would be better for fi. If the spirit in every
organization is inereased, how can the spirit
of the whole keep from gaining momen-
tum ?

Night Reviews...

The cgport has it that there have been
objections to might reviews given by the
protessors. We teel that it is essential that |
some reviews be held at night. ‘The math
proiessors have found by experienee that it
is an almost impossible feat to hold a math
review down to one hour, due to the tength
of time required to work problems. The stu--
dents in mathematics fect. almost as a whole
that night tests are necessary. -These re-
views can interfere with. athletic practices
and other activities only when the student
lets his work slide until the afternoon be-
fore the review.

Freshman Franchise...

Yesterday, the freshman franchise was
presented to the student body for a renewed
consideration, It has been before the stu-
dent body before but/it was voted down.

The franchise deserves a real considera-
tion, minus the usual prejudices against the
frosh. Admitted that the yearlings should
not have privileges on a par with those of
upperclassmen. But this should not be an
argument against the franchise. -

The freshmen ought to be allowed to vote.
They are capable. They belong to the stu-
dent body. The student body leaders are
‘their leaders. Why do we wait? Give the

Absentee Vote...

Every vear. it happens. During the mos?
Wiportant elections adileue teams, debating
teams, and deputations leave the campus
olten cutting down che voting student body
as much as fiily vores.

Obviously. those men deserve a vote even
even thongh not on campus and obviously
those potential voters. iif provided with the
opportunity to vote might tura the result.
And naturally enough, to make an election
far the whole body of voters. should cast
their ballots.

Of course. yon cannot keep men on the
campus to vote when there are more import-
ant things to be done off campus, But. in
many eases, the men can be given some op-
portunity to vote. The most feasible plan
we see to offer is that the particular individ-
ual in charge of eaeh clection see that the
students leaving the campus have their op-
poruinity to vote before they go.

Even though nominatians had not been
made, in most elections the average student
knows who will come up and ior whom he
preters to vote. There may be a tew misses
in thig system but at least anything woud
he fairer tham the present absence of the
greatest possible voting majority.

“

As Others See It

Atter studying the matter a bit. we are
irank to admit that we have no such thing
as an editorial policy —in the conventional
sense of the word. Generally speaking, an
editorial policy amounts to deciding at the
beginning of the year what to be for; and
whaz to be against, setting these decisions in
a dictle box at the top of the editorial col-
umns and then holding yourself the rest
of the vear within these limits.’

This would be working on the same the-.
ory as do those professors who ontline their
lectures at the beginning of the term and
hever onee Yeer so much as a comma from
those outlines—and our experience with that
type of professor definitely has been un-
inte resting. :

It any exiitorial staff is to have a policy
that is more than a group of words in a
boid box. it cannot be superimposed at the
beginning of their term of service but must
grow with them, erring as they err and
striking success as they succeed.

It is impossible for them to predetermine
what their attitude toward specitic issttes
shall be ig they are to best serve the inter-
ests of their editorship. They can only keep
themsetves as fully supplied with facts as
possible and let their attitude be impastially
determined by those facts.

DAVIDSON STILL “TOPS”

Ror the last few weeks we have heard so
much criticism of Davidson, some of which
was very true. that | would like tc offer a
bit of praise.

As everyone comes to the end
ot his four years of study at a
college or university, he won-
ders if he made a correct deci-
sion in choosing his particular
school. As I think back, I am
satisfied that-I could not have made a bet-
ter choice than Davidson.

Davidson rates second to none in the scho-
lastic world. Equipped with an excellent
faculty and modern buildings, the college
has devoted itself for over a hundred years
to its chief mission—<leveloping the minds
of young men.

Men have every opportunity to improve
themselves physically in varsity and intra-
mural sports. Our varsity teams are not
composed of a small group of “hired hands.”
Rather, they are made up of students who
have had little previous training in that
sport.

Davidson extends unusual chances for
spiritual enlargement. The most préminent
religious leadérs in the South speak during
the church periods. Courses in Bible are
taught and all students gather for a chapel
period each day. The local “Y” is active on
the campus.

Also, there are a great variety of extra-
curricular activities open to all; the campus
is free of organized politics ; it is not a mili-—
tary school but has military training - for
those that desire it; there are few rules
that govern students; has an excellent sys-
tem of student government; a_ friendly
spirit of co-operation, the “Wildcat Spirit”
permeates the campus.

FOR FROSH VOTE... .

About this freshman voté ques-
tion — by the time this is read, the:
Student Body will have presented
before them for -their approval an
amendment to the Constitution
which will give freshmen the right
to vote in the spring Student Body
elections, This really means, in
plain’ language, that — freshmen
would be made a part of the Stu-
dent Body of Davidson College.
That to mé is the main issue.

A Tf any man on the campus were
casually asked how many classes
there are in our Student Body, he
would almost invariably say “four.”
“As the Constitution how stands, that
is wrong. The freshmen are not a
Part of.us. (Read Article V, Sec-
tion 3 of the Constitution). Yet we
are always barking for the fresh-
men to “support.this” and “sup-
port that.” We say to them: “Baek
up your team.” But it is not, “their
team™ as long as they are not
members of this group. How can
we expect.them to support officers
and a government whose privileges
they are denied but to whose rule
they must submit?

You say they need discipline? I
tell you they need a helping hand.
Yor say that they must stand trial
ler a vear to prove their tight to

of those who will “flunk out" left

AROUND TOWN: There's been
a lot of talk in Charlotte about the
“Blue Laws.” but nothing can be
done that will please anybody.
Doesn't it seem only fair that we
should revise our ‘Blue Laws’ here
in Davidson, too? For instance:
the drug. stores are closed all day
Sunday and with warm weather ap-
proaching scores of boys will trek
every Sunday to the road house to
buy something cold to drink and a
hite to eat. We get no commission
trom the drug stores but it would
be mast convenient to everyone in
town and besides-tlie men at the
drug stores have to work there
several hours every Sunday any-
way. Someone might mention it
where. it would do the most good.

The tests will measure what sen-
