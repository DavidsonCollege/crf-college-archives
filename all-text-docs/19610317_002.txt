The Forgotten Man

“No fraternity mah has ever
gone inactive to get more

social life.’

Sam Pope’s canny observation re-
garding the social limitations of being
a non-fraternity man points up an
obvious fact which is generally ig-
nored:

The Independent is Davidson’s
forgotten man.

In 1957 almost a half-million dol-
lars were spent to improve facilities
for Davidson’s “showcase” fraternity
system. Now, fraternity men enjoy
plush facilities and the services of
housemothers.

Not so with the independents.

From day to day they must file
through a cafeteria line for their
meals, they endure the lack of any
private leisure-time facility, for they

ave only the College Union. a public

building scarcely noted for home-like
warmth.

The, independents are’ handicap-
“ped and mconvenienced — whether or
not they are independent by choice —

merely because they do not belong;
they are not members of Davidson's
eighty-five precent majority, which,
like all majorities, is privileged. power-
ful. complacent and self-centered.

Consider the plight of the inde-
pendent on a dance weekend, which,
incidentally, he has no part in plan-

ning. If he dates, he must subject his
date to the cafeteria line and the hash-
house atmosphere of the union snack-
bar. He has no place to go during
dance intermissions — except to the
union again.

And after the dance, he has no
place to go — except to the union
again, to watch an outdated movie
_and attend a limp, tea-and-crumpets
party.

All this, perhaps, would not be so
bad if most independents chose their
own lot and planned their social life
— or their lack of it.

But they do not.

Many are shunted into indepen-
dence by the aribtrary cruelty of Rush
‘Week: they accept grudgingty the bit-
ter pill of an “independence” which
means second-rate facilities, second-
rate social life, a second-rate role in
the life of the college.

The problem, of course, might be
eased by an independent organization

like the now-defunct Campus Club.
But organization is difficult for the
independents, who often are bound
not by friendship or common interests
but by the negative bond of not be-
longing; many, in addition, oppose an
organization which almost surely
would become another fraternity, prac-
ticing the exclusiveness which inde-
pendents oppose in principle.

THE DAVIDSONIAN enthusiastic-
ally endorses some other suggestions:

A partial solution which all would
welcome is a better facility for the
independent: surroundings convenient
and attractive enough to make it no
sacrifice to be a non-fraternity man.
The college, which heretofore has
shown little feeling of responsibility
toward. the independents, could take
a giant stép by providing a suitable
independent “house.”

Independents should be given a
vital role in planning campus-wide
social events. It is not fair ror tne. fra-
ternity system to be in complete
charge of Davidson’s social life. We
note with interest Roger Durham's
suggestion that social planning be
made a student body responsibility
and that only fraternity activities be
in the charge of the fraternity system.

Davidson’s smaller fraternities,
doubtless, would welcome the oppor-
tunity to sponsor joint after-dance
parties with the independent group;
joint parties would relieve small-fra-
ternity financial problems and pro-
vide after-dance enjoyment for inde-
pendents.

We urge the faculty committee
on social life —- which seems to con-
centrate almost exclusively on fra-
ternity problems — to take this prob-
lem under consideration.

We encourage the Student Coun-
cil, the Interfraternity Council and the
independents themselves to begin
some creative consideration of the
difficulties of non-fraternity men.

And we hope the administration
will consider providing better facilities
for the independents.

Davidson’s indépendents should
be participants in Davidson's social
system — and no longer victims of it.

E.S.D.

The Walkie-Talkie System

One of Davidson’s most powerful
and respected student organizations
may be withering on the vine.

Unless some revitalizing joy juice
is pumped into strategic spots, the
Interfraternity Council may lose its
considerable prestige.

The IFC this year has done little
more than make plans for dance week-
ends and concerts. It seriously endan-
gered the fraternity system last fall
when its feeble efforts to solve the
sophomore rush problem became little
more than a wry joke in faculty circles.
It has gone out of its way to do noth-
ing, particularly when doing nothing
was the easiest way of doing things.

Recently the council members
were asked to help out with the
Easter Seal drive. The major part of
the discussion on the request was
devoted to what sort. of excuse they
could make up to get themselves out
of it. It was a desision to do nothing.

The IFC is a case in mediocre
leadership, The group is composed of
seniors who aren’t willing to stick
their necks out, and juniors who are
trying only to please the seniors.

IFC members are called represen-
tatives but are actually little more
than walkie-talkies. Herein lies the
problem.

The IFC legislates by referendum.
Every time a new issue comes up, the
representatives refer it to the fratern-
ity meeting “to see what the boys
down at the house think about it.”
Since the boys down at the house are
generally not especially well informed
on the issues, the problem gets pretty
garbled in the process. Perhaps what
the IFC needs most is an intercom
system between fraternity court and
the Blue Room of the College Union.

During the Sophomore Rush mess
the walkie-talkie system mal-function-
ed, came close to wiping out two or
three fraternities, exasperated those
faculty members who were trying to
help, and generally confused the

issue.

What happened was, a proposal
about how to solve the problem was
sent to the IFC by one of the IFC
members. The IFC sent it to the fra-
ternities. who sent it back. The IFC re-
vised the proposal and sent it back to
the fraternities. Again it was rejected.

Then someone thought of the
pledge class presidents, who, having
been at. Davidson for two months,
knew all about the problems facing
the fraternities. The IFC asked them
to write something and they did.

Rapidly running out of people to
send things to, the IFC decided to
present the whole pile of proposals,
revised proposals (finally approved),
recommendations, objections, etc. to
the faculty. The faculty listened, said
they’d think about it.

Finally, the fraternity presidents
had to step in, and with straightfor-
ward, direct action, clear the mess up.

At no time during the entire riga-
marole did the IFC make much of an
attempt at intelligent compromise. In
fact, it hardly attempted anything
without first Passing the buck back
to the fraternities. The IFC didn’t
lead — it followed.

The weakness, of course lies in
the referendum system. The IFC is
evidently afraid to exert its leader-
ship.

It seems that most IFC represen-
tatives fee] little responsibility to the
school or even to the system as a
whole. Their sole responsibility ap-
pears to be tied up to their respective
fraternities.

The council, once thought of as
well-nigh infallible, has earned some
critics this year. There has even been
some discussion about shifting the
non-social functions of the group to
the Student Council so as to allow the
IFC to devote its full time to planning
dance weekends.

We hope that this won't prove
necessary. All the IFC needs is a new
philosophy and a little dynamic leader-
ship.

PRESENT SET-UP IS INADEQUATE

Independents Speak Out For
Improved Social Life Facilities

By RICK von UNWERTH

What's it like to be an
independent?

A DAVIDSONIAN poll this
week sought the answers.

A handful of independents,
questioned about the social
problems of the non-fratern-
ity man on campus, drew a
picture of limited facilities
and a circumscribed social
life — and they offered sug-
gestions for improving the
situation. ‘
The problem. agreed most,
is that the independent stu-
dent has no place to go.

independents eat in the

Union snack bar and at res-
taurants and sandwich
shops in the town of Da-
vidson; their only head.
quarters for recreation is
the College Union; they
have little or no organiza.
tion.

Few are satisfied with the
situation as it now evists
Most of them want a change
— though they are not agreed
on what the change should
be.

Most would like for the
college to provide a house
or meeting place for inde-
pendent use only, similar
to a fraternity house,
where independents could
go to relax.

Some suggested an organi-
zation of independent stu-

dents.

And many advocate a more
active role. for independents
in planning campus social
life.
Most complaints center
about independent difficulties
on Dance Weekends.

Said Senior Charles Ringe:
“At present the independent
must take his date to the
Union, where there are many
who don't date. This tends to
embarrass both those who are
dating and those without
dates.”

He suggested that “the in-
dependents should be allowed
to use the faculty club or

something on this order. I

think such a facility would
improve the situation.”

Student Body President
Henry Shue added, “The

problem about Dance Week-
ends is that the independent
group can’t feel like it is as
much our dance weekend,
because we haven't had a part
in its planning.

“It’s as though the non-
fraternity men are simply
invited. This creates a feel-

ing that social activities
are given for us but not
by us.”

“There's nothing particul-
arly exciting about going to
the Union movie after the
dances,” said Sam Pope, a

Civil War, Reconstruction

Did Not Close Davidson

By LEONARD RICHARDSON

Davidson College was the
only college south of Vir-
ginia that did not close for
.a single session during the
War Between the States and
Reconstruction. All the col-
leges in the Confederate

States except Davidson and
Roanoke College in Salem,
Virginia were forced to sus-
pend instruction at some
time during the war years of
1861-1865 and the Recon-
struction era.

When the call for young
men to defend their respec-
tive states grew stronger
than the call to learning,
Davidson’s enroliment dwin-
dled until at times the stu-
dent body consisted only of
prep school boys, ministcrial
students, and Confederate
Army casualties who had
been too seriously wounded
to continue fighting.

A preparatory depert-
ment for boys in their
early teens was organized

there were also at Davidson
a few sons of wealthy fam-
ilies from Maryland and Vir-
ginia who had hired substi-
tutes to fight for them. Pos-
sibly these boys came to the
small Presbyterian college
in North Carolina to avoid
the draft.

During the week follow-
ing May 3, 1861, many stu-
dents left Davidson to join
the armies of their home
states. No formal closing
exercises were held that
year, but the Board of
Trustees authorized the
faculty to confer the A.B.
degree on ali the mem-
bers of the class of 1861.
There were no graduates

during the war except for
James Henry Douglass in
1864, who became a Presby-
terian minister. After the
war, there were no gradu-
ates until 1867 when the
class consisted of one man,
a disabled veteran named
John Lawrence Caldwell

senior. “Most of the week-
ends aren’t so much for the
dance but for the after-dance
parties.”

What’s the solution?

Ringo suggests “a more
closely-knit organization
which could enable indepen-
dents to plan and carry out
a more well-rounded social
life.”

But Sam Pope and others
disagree. “Meany indepen-
dents aren't interested in a
strong organization,” he
said. “There are those who
want organization, those
who don‘t, and some who
would like to be in fratern-
ities.”

Sophomore Dudley Salley
suggests improving facilities
and “taking some of the pres-
sure off the freshman to
pledge a fraternity that may
not be his choice. Many of
them feel that it is a choice
between social life and none
at all.”

There was strong agree-
ment that independents
should have a bigger voice
in campus social planning.

Ringe believes “the inde.
pendents should be given a
vote on the IFC. This would
give them a voice in the
planning of the only campus-
wide social activities.”

And Roger Durham, a
Greensboro sophomore,
suggested that Dance week:
ends be planned by a social
committe under the student
council.

“The social functions would
then be sponsored by the
school rather than the fra
ternities,” Durham said. “The
committee would be made up
of one voting representative
from. each fraternity and one
independent.”

Under Durham‘s plan,
the IFC would continue to
have charge of rushing and
inter-fraternity functions,
but would not be respon.
sible for school-wide activ-
ities,

Said Henry Shue: ‘TI do
feel that there should be
some way for independents
to share in the planning and
work necessary for these,
events. This would help them
feel more a part of the
school.”

Among the independents
questioned, there was mild
disagreement on solutions to
the thorny “independent
problem.”

But all agreed on one
point: things could be
much better.

“No fraternity man,” quip-
ped Sam Pope, “has ever gone
inactive to get more social

FOCUS

Madcap Charlie Reed —
Was Last Of His Kind

By ERVIN DUGGAN

Argue if you will, but the fact remains: Davidson’s
legendary characters, her uproarious and capricious
personalities, her hilarious eccentrics are no more.

They have been frozen out by the icy blasts of
collegiate coolness, frightened by our stolid rever-
ence for the conventional, muzzled by our lack of
daring, repelled by our grim search for status and
security.

Davidson has became a cradle for the comfortable
and the cautious, not a gathering-ground for original
minds; we are a community of the competent, not the
creative.

What’s become of the characters?

They are gone — perhaps forever. ;

Gone, too, is Charlie Reed, perhaps the wildest of
all the campus individualists. Reed, a tall, bespectacled
madcap, graduated last year after four years at David-
son and a year in Munich. ; ;

Now he’s studying history at the University of
Chicago, planning to become a college professor..

THE GREAT IMPOSTER

There are scores of tales about Reed’s “masquer-
ades.”

On one occasion Reed and a handful of com-
patriots, posing as “the Princeton Tennis Team,”
made a hilarious foray into South Carolina, complete
with chauffeur and valet.

They paid a visit to Limestone College, caused.
a major flurry (with their opulent equippage and thei_
feigned snobbery) among the status-conscious coeds,
and then returned to Davidson. ;

Reed delighted in loading a truck wtih student
“gospeleers” and parading through Charlotte, singing
and preaching. Assuming the role of a fiery revivalist.
he would wave.a Bible and shout, “I wanta talk to you
obut GAWD!” ;

And amidst cries of “Amen!” and “Hallelujah!”
he would exhort passers-by to repent and avoid the
gaping maw of Hell.

HE COMMANDED THE PEONS

He was on organizer par excellence.

Perhaps his favorite project was the Peon
Army, which he commanded his senior year. When
Davidson’s ROTC Brigade had its 1960 awards day,
the Peon commander gleefully padiocked all exits
from the drill field and left the entire cadet corps
,cooped and helpless within the fences.

One week later, he staged the great Peon Awards
Day, presenting the Julius Rosenberg Medal to the
“worst. MS III cadet” and the Aaron Burr Award to
“the most lackadaisical MS IV.”

His pageant was highlighted by scripture (“They
shall beat their swords into ploughshares!’’), band
music, and a message from the English Pacifist Move-
ment, presented by a Richardson Scholar from Britain.

it was Reed who masterminded the famous
“Who's Nothing” tapping ceremony, a farcical chapel
program recognizing outstanding campus goof-offs.

* And Reed organized and directed the Davidson
Hymnasters, an offbeat choral group dedicated to har-
monizing risque barroom songs in fine style.

CAMPING AT SWEETBRIAR
His miscellaneous antics were breathtaking.

One night an astonished dean caught Reed and
another Davidson student camping on the Sweet-
briar College grounds. When she accused him of |
prowling, Reed rose in mock. indignation, informed
the lady that he was no peeping-tom, but a lover of
the outdoor life who often slept beneath the stars.

And then he scooped up his blanket, strode to his
nearby Volkswagen and roared away, leaving the dean
Standing open-mouthed.

HE WAS A BRAIN

Reed was as brainy as he was zany.

His academic record, though it often dipped near
or .below the danger line, also displayed a sizeable
number of superior grades, compiled effortlessly by
Reed, who studied in fits according to his mood and
inclination.

He was a votacious reader, a keen student of
history and political science, a talented writer who
loved to write term papers.

And once a friend heard him singing along with
Eileen Farrell’s recording of Brunhilde’s Immolation
from Die Gotterdammerung; he knew not only the
music but all the lyrics, singing in flawless German.

The brilliant Reed, fascinated by opera, had memo-
rized most of Wagner's operatic works during his
Munich year, on frequent trips to the Wagner festival
at Bareuth.

HE’S STILL AT IT
Now, from Chicago, reports filter south which hint
that his penchant for adventure has not waned.

During the winter, to settle an argument with a
northern colleague who sneered at the South, he
loaded his reluctant opponent into his car and
headed on an impromptu Southern jaunt. Arriving
in Winston-Salem, Reed and his friend dropped in
unexpectedly on a Davidson classmate’s parents.

“We've come to spend the weekend,” Reed an-
nounced. .

_ And when they were ushered to the guest room by
their surprised hostess, the incomparable Reed turned
triumphantly to his awed Yankee friend.

“That,” he said, “is Southern Hospitality!”

THE BEST DAYS ARE OVER
Charlie Reed won't be coming back.

He was a once-in-e-lifetime experience for Da-
vidson College: a rare combination of brains and
bubble, a Compleat Man whose friends included
the most scholarly of the scholars and the most hell-
acious of the hell-raisers.

He was the last of his breed. a heroic breed of -
swashbuckling, irreverent individualists.
a Their days were the best days, the most exciting
ays.

__ Now, Davidson’s academic fields — if they are
still fertile — abound with identical plants in serried
rows, like corn; the place is no longer the rich and
steaming tropical jungle of personalities that it once
was.

The best days, the most exciting days — alas —
