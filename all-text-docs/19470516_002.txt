Letters To The Editor

Dear Editor:

In response to your petition for the de-
parting seniors to “speak up” I'd like to
make a few suggestions which I feel may
be representative of the thoughts running
through the minds of quite a few of us
who are leaving.

1. There is ac mspicuous and perhaps
a dangerous lack of fire precautionary
training given to Davidson students. Per-
haps this fear of the possibility of fire has
been enhanced in the minds of some of us
who were in the service, but no amount of
fire fighting. equipment, and of fire drills
should be considered a waste of time. The
majority of students are careless with their
smoking in the dormitories. There is no
organized system of evacuation or of stu-
dent fire fighting: There is no specific
alarm system to my knowledge. The disas-
ter of Old Chambers should be sufficient
warning to the college to take pains to
guard against this possibility. It has taken
a long time to raise sufficient, funds for
the new gym. l.ose one dormitory, and
another campaign for funds would be in
the offing.
2. My second suggestion is a rather
revolutionary one. It involves instituting a
system of compulsory public speaking, I
do not mean that every student should be
required to take a course in Public Speak-
ing, as he does in Freshman Math or His-
~ tory, I mean rather that instruction’in this
subject be incorporated into the elementary
English courses. It is of little avail toteach
aman good grammar and to recognize. the
classics, when all the while he is absolutely
tongue-tied in the presence of five or more
people. The student need not even be in-
structed in the art of speech making. That
is ‘an art reserved for a privileged few.
However, if he simply were required to
give readings and other oral memory work.
I am almost postive that within a year or
so, the whole deméanor and self-assurance
of the average student, as. régards his
appearance to the public, would be greatly
» improved. -‘Other institutions who have
made experiments in this department have
‘been greatly impressed with the results
produced.

‘53. My third suggestion concerns the
; daily Chapel exercises. For anyone who
has stepped into the auditorium at times
other than when exercises are being held

and listened to Mr. Pfohl, Mr. Noehren,
or music students laboriously practicing,
on the organ, hour on hour, it seems al-
most a sacrilege to observe the utter dis-
regard on the part of the student body for
the preludes in the daily programs. The
average student may unaware
‘that organ music precedes every program.
To the members of the Music Department,
the playing of the organ is the exercise of
their. profession. They do it well. If they

even be

here. They take pride in their music, and
though they would be the last to say so, |
dare say that they swallow a lot of that
same pride’each day before they begin to
play in the face of the usual tumult of
chapel jabbering. 1 make the suggestion
that either. the music continue in the pro-
grams, and:the students be asked to remain
silent during the playing, or that the pre-
lude organ music be done away with en-
tirely, The latter, however, should be con-
sidered as an alternate remedy, =

3. The third suggestion is one that
was made and carried out rather success-|
fully in 1943. It also deals with the Chapel |
exercises. Tuesdays and Thursdays have
been designated as Student Days. Mon-|
days, Wednesdays, and Fridays, have been}
designated as worship programs _ solely. |
Under the present system, there is little|
difference in student body conduct on|
cither of these days. The only restraint
noticeably exercised on the latter days is
that so far no students have been “passed
down” from the rear of the auditorium. So
student body announcements. should be
read from the floor on Mondays, Wednes-
days and Fridays. The President. of the
Student Body ‘should act as a “clearing}
house’ on these days, and select what
announcements he considers absolutely im-
perative to be read, These announiements
should be passed up to the plattorm prior
to the service and read by the speaker or
the man» introducing..the speaker. This
practice would have a tendency to make
the program a little more formal, as op-
posed to the less restricted Student Chapel
Days. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, a
short devotional exercise should be con-
ducted and the program turned over to the
students. Only in extreme emergencies
should these days be taken over as full
length worship programs. If the student
is expected to conduet himself in a more
restricted manner on Tuesdays, Wednes-
days and Fridays, he should have the right
to expect that Tuesdays and Thursdays
are his days, and that this right will always
be protected,

4: My fourth and last suggestion is|
one.that has no concrete solution. It is|
merely something that can be encouraged. |
I refer fo Student-Faculty relations. Da-|
vidson is a closely knit community, where |
hoth conditions-and atmosphere lend them-|
selves ta a practical, close relationship be-
tween the student and the professor. T ap-
prove of the school’s printing the names
of those faculty homes that are open to
students each Sunday evening. However.
not nearly enough students are availing
themselves of this privilege. Very often
we hear the remark, I could have passed
that review if T’d only known what he
wanted!" Tf more students would. start
‘isiting their professors and learn to know
them as friends rather than as pedagogues,
they could get rid of a lot ‘of the psycholo-
gical bugs which pursue the average stu-
dent when he is faced with a review. The
professors don’t enjov a strict stern re-
lationship any more than the student does.
Here at Davidson. there is the ideal op-
portunity to get to know your teachers. and
in so doing many may: come closer to
getting an education than merely getting <
degree. :

The school and the student mav take
theses uggestions for what they are worth.
Some may not be practical, but T believe
they may be a step toward what is refer-
red to as “A Better Davidson.”

BY BOB RIERSON

What is all the hubbub about this
business of the size of the David-
son College student body in’ future
planning? There has been a tre-
mendous amount of argument pro
and con on the subject, and yet the
conclusion of either side very
clear when. one comes to weigh
the respective merits of each. To
this corner all the good points seem
|to migrate to the side of reduced
lenrollment at the end of the pres-
|ent emergency as the only possible
lchoice of steps to be taken. I ac-
|tually find it difficult to find any
| logical argument for the side which
| contends for enlarged enrollment.
| The added satisfaction that one
;could get by saying that he went
/to a school of 1,000 students as op-
posed to that given by the mere
number 650 is hardly worth the in-
conveniences in providing for the
350. After all if one must
| boast about numbers, he might gain
admission to New York university
which enrolled some 35,708 hardy
souls in 1946,

It is the tacitly understood policy
among the members of the admin-

is

{extra

jistration of this college that they

are not trying to do what so many
schools in this country are. They
have no aspirations of becoming a
university some day in the future
with millions of greenbacks grow-
ing on the hill instead of the now-
present foliage. Instead Davidson
strives to give young men a good
sound basis for further activity in
the ways of life. There is no at-
tempt at specialization, but only
an attempt to provide the ground-
work for anyone who wishes to
delve more deeply into higher edu-
cation. In short Davidson claims
nothing more than the offering of
a good liberal education, and it is
renowned throughout educational
circles as doing just that, just as

well as any, and far better than!

most colleges in the nation.

Very well, having gained a clear
picture of what Davidson is trying
to do, we can proceed with deter-
mining the true ideal size of such
an institution. It is very evident
to all students here this year and
suffering the various tribulations
encountered _ in living conditions in
| the dorms, that 900 students is far
|too many. for the facilities pro-
| vided. There has been much grum-
bling on this matter, some of which
might be stopped by these grum-
blers having to serve a semester’s
hitch in one of the large universi-
ties of our land where a man is
content to have a tent over his head
and feels himself in heaven if he
may share a Quonset hut with six
other lucky fellows. But still it
is easy to see that these conditions
will not prevail indefinitely, that
they will doubtless all have passed
within five years. Therefore Da-
vidson cannot keep its present size
with its present equipment. If
the” ¢ood round number of 1,000
students is the goal, two more dor-
mitorjes will have to be added, and
much needed repairs must be car-
ried out with respect to some of
the older, more delapidated dorms
now in use. So the question of
650 to 1,000 would be in the hands
of the guiding powers of this in-
stitution, whether they will see fit
to increase the present plant or
not. Neither number is bad. Either
denotes exclusiveness when com-
pared to the monstrous figures in
larger schools. But if 1,000 be the
magic number, then new buildings
will have. to be the order of the
day.

The prime consideration is, and
will have to be, the quality of the
education offered. As long as it
maintains its past and presént high
standard, the future will take care
of itself.

PI KAPPA. PHI
Following the noble traditions of

their honorable ancestors, the Pi
Kaps roamed both near and far this
past week-end. As a result of the
coercion of Brothers Schenck and
Edwards, however, the majority re-
mained to support the ball given
by Scabbard and Blade. Among
those attending this function were
Brothers Cline, Edwards, Schenck,
Read, Reid, Walker (2), Boykin,
Hunter, Robertson, etc.

The Brothers Barringer took off
for the usual week end in Florence.
It is also reported that O. D. Evans
was taking off too but forgot to
retract his flaps. ($20.00 fine, pilot
error:

Everybody was a big wheel this
week end, everybody dealed in large
dimensions, and everybody had a
big time. In short: big week end.
Brother Pahl, heading the list of
decorated bellboys, was ravishing
in faded canvas and skivvy buttons.
He was escorted by Maggie Donald.
Big dealer Smiley big-dealed as
usual, only moreso. Brother Jim
Harris wheeled in unusual style.
Brothér Vaughan MacAlister came
to the dances with — relatives.
Brother Aiken came too—dated no
less—which somehow irked Broth-
ers»Faison and Allsop into getting
up a two-way plot. Brother Cod-
dington is quieting down at last,
now that Puddin has gone back ‘to
Hollins. But he’s been staring at
the ceiling (also papered with pic-
tures of McKoy) ever since. If
you want to know what happened

to Brothers J. MacAlister, Bob

Strickland, Bobby Carson, Torry
Hemby, Biil Little, and Bob Little,
you'll have to ask them. But rest
assured they wheeled in some ca-
pacity or other. Brother Bronco
turned in an unusual performance.
To top the week end off, we had
a breakfast at the Rears Head,
and you know how wheels love to
eat. I want to tell you it was all
fine.
DELTA KAPPA

Delta Kappa announces with
pleasure the initiation of the fol-
lowing on the 6th of May: Bob
Butt, John Pritchard, Walter Mann,
Mott Price, Professors Puckett, Mc-
Geachy and Pietenpohl.

Calhoun was at his usual high,
providing a fine feed after initia-
tion at which several of the new
members definitely entered the race
for cake consumption. Miller and
Carr are said to be taking a cor-
respondence course in auto repair.
And Buford and Ashléy aré’at. it
again. But perhaps we’d better
let well enough alone. Much jubi-
lation was apparent when dealers
Williams and Richard returned
from Charlotte with Richard still
speaking with the Spanish brogue.
Things wouldn’t be half so bad if
someone could just answer Diet-
rich’s question: What Is a Whif-
fenpoof, anyway? Anybody who
gets up at 6:30 to play tennis must
need his head examined. Of course
we’ve had our doubts about Murray
for some time, to say the least,
but the Straw that broke the
camel’s back occurred when he tried
to pry Zedaker from the sack at
the bust of dawn.

Cinema Comments

By Bill Calhoun

MONDAY-TUESDAY

“THE JOLSON STORY”
As the best musical of the year,
this picture portrays the ‘story of
the life of the immortal Al Jolson.
Jolson’s songs are featured, and
they are sung by him through the
“screen front” of Larry Parks.
Parks plays magnificently ‘his part
as Jolson. Evelyn Keyes, the beau-
tiful blonde, is outstanding as Jol-
son‘s wife, who, unfortunately for
the story (and Jolson)* leaves him
because of his love for music and
performing.
WEDNESDAY-THURSDAY

“THE ANGEL AND THE

BADMEN”

John Wayne is the producer and
the star of the fast-paced West-
erner, of the well-known type of
“horse operas”. He plays a fron-

tier bandit who is reformed by an
old Quaker family. Gorgeous Gail
Russel is the major influence in
his reformation from .the criminal
life to the respectable family life
of the frontier settler. Although
a rather typical Western, there is
enough suspense involved to make
an interesting movie.
FRIDAY-SATURDAY
“JUNGLE PRINCESS”

“Grass _ skirt’? Dottie Lamour is
featured in this interesting (need
I say that) movie of the jungle
and uncivilized wilderness contain-
ed therein. Although an old pic-
ture, brought back after a number
of years, it is well worth seeing
for obvious reasons. It also has
some plot and is somewhat inter-
esting in parts. Lamour, toujour
l'amour.

clude: President, John Fesperman;
vice. president, Buford Goodman;
secretary, Spencer Murray; treas-
urer, Rodney Whisnant; warden,
Bill Clark.

KAPPA SIGMA

Review-torn and exam-laden,
even the dealers’ style has been
cramped and the past week end
found a number of the brothers re-
cuperating in the seclusion of their
dormitories. Dum Dum_ Enne-
face still unable to digest the loss
of his jock in the recent Ky. opener,
retired to the hills of Asheville
with a carton of Philip Morris to
dream of Beowulf. Concerning the
mythical. hero, quote Dum Dum:
“Mah Ah’deal.” Jim Love’ decided
to escape it all and headed north
for the garden festival at Cam-
bridge and the last we heard, he
was smiling at a snap-dragon. He
might be a poor boy but his ole
man’s got piles.

Jerk Wade was found dissipating
in Charlotte while Ready-Teddy was
seen running around with some
character brawling at. the brawds
outside the Broadway theater. With
“Hogan” back in town, Doug Rice
is back in the saddle and taking
the Queen City by storm. Wally
Pack spent .most of the week end
organizing his Auto Safety Club
and initiated his first member,
Lucky Teter Pearson. Honorary
members include Martin Waters and
John McDonald.

With disappointment we share
sympathy with Frigid Freeman
Jdnes who let one Jean F. slip
through his fingers into matrimony.
We haven’t seen much of Footsie
Currie and Pat Williams—but small
wonder. The former was caught
matriculating near the flagpole on
Friday nite while the latter was
reported'having been seen showing
ffis thesis to all the professors.

Knighthood news unti] next year
when our newly elected number one,
Sam Ervin, will lead us forth.

Knights who were in the wheel-
ing mood this week were great in
number, Senor Payne went to the
Junior-Senior dance Woman’s
College in Greensboro. Concerning
his operations there, nothing
known. He has kept them in strict
secrecy, not even divulging them
to his best friend, Trakas. St.
Mary’s was the hostess to brothers
Lindsay, Spillman, and “Sex”
Glenn.  Glenn’s new title describes
his operations fully. Making more
extensive travels was Bill Bason
who covered the state from Salem
to the beaches.

The main operation of the
Knights for ‘the week end was the
Military Balk in Charlotte. The
night before this occasion the il-
lustrious John Adams was seen at
the Harry James dance with his
date. Later he announced that he
had taken over a Boy Scout troop
in Charlotte. Also was seen Bud
Fowle who was definitely not bored
at a recent lawn party in Charlotte
where he had a blonde with blve
eyes.

Heading for home were brothers
Flowers, Manget, and Scofield.
Manget was dealing so extensively .
in Decatur that as this column -goes
to press he has as yet not returned.
Maybe his dealing wasn’t at Agnes

Georgia. He has been known to
stop there before on his return to
