KNIGHTS OF THE NEW LOOK

The summer is over. Slowly the upperclassmen wan-
der in, while eager, untested freshmen run around with
trash cans in their hands looking for the faucets. After
the usual “How ya doing?” and the bone-crushing hand-
shake from areal fraternity brother with the meat grinder
paw, the subject turns to football.

When the question arises, “‘Are they really going to
dress out part of the Queens roving 6 to help with the kick-
ing team?” you simply can’t help but wonder. Just what
kind of team will we have this year?

Those friends of Davidson, the football prognostica-
tors, have turned their attention to the Southern Confer-
ence and sent in last year predictions for this year. David-
son is ranked near the bottom for a variety of reasons—
size, lettermen and tradition.

But hark, There is one ray of light beaming into
Richardson Field. Playboy, the magazine of studs which
claims to be an authority on all sports played inside and
outside, has faith in us. Though they doomed the Knights
of the New Look to the lower half of their class, they still
foresee Davidson in a post-season game. Would you be-
lieve a loss in the Cereal Bow] in Battle Creek?

Despite what the man in that booth of Hattie’s tells
you, Davidson has a good team. I don’t say they will
run George Washington off the field, or even beat them.
But, if they play like they practice, everyone will hang
in there until they have to be carried from the field. And
if the ranks get extremely thin, keep your eyes on the
assistant coaches edging toward the dressing room, slip-

ing off their shirts as they go. Young coaches do come
in handy occasionally.

To for a championship team this year is dream-
ing. But the teams we're surrounded with in the pre-
season surveys are not good company. Davidson has a
respectable team and they want to win. Homer Smith has
taught winning and this team has learned it. Winning
tasted good last year. It will taste even better this year.

Mitchell Chief

Warren Mitchell, a vital be-
hind-the-scenes cog in the Wild-
cat basketball machine in his
capacity as assistant coach, has
left his post at Davidson to be-
come head coach at William and
Mary.

“We hate to lose him,"’ said
Athletic Director Dr. Tom Scott,
‘but of course we wouldn't want
to stop him. Assistant coaches
are in it to advance as much as
they can, and Warren has been
offered a real fine job at Wil-
liam and Mary.”

No replacement
found, Scott said.

Monday

Monday at 4 p.m. there will
be a stampede of 250 mumbling,
grumbling, stumbling freshmen.
The annual event, which is
traditionally called the ‘‘cake
race’, will take place over the
one and seven-tenths miles
cross-country course and will in-
clude all of the Class of 1970,
except football players and those
with a doctor’s excuse.

Coach Heath Whittle said there
will be about 75 cakes awarded
to the first finishers of those
who do not choke, cheat, col-
lapse, become “‘ill"’ or get knock-
ed down by upperclassmen’s au-
tos.

Freshmen are reminded to
wear their PE uniforms and
urged to report to the soccer
field on time in order not to
keep waiting the throngs of up-
perclassmen who will turn out
to reminisce.

With an obvious handicap in
the depth department, the "Cats

been many bright spots this
year. Tommy Dews, labelled by
Coach Smith ‘‘a fierce competi

unanimously elected captain of
the ‘Cats and rates as a top
candidate for all-conference hon

The offense will be strong up
