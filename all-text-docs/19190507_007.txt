Attractive Rest Room In
Gym for Visitors Com.

Everyone is Cordially Invited to See
this Room. Write Your Friends.

Mr. Miles has planned to fix up the
large room just to qhe left on entering
the Gym, as a reception room for visit-
ors during commencement. This is an
excellent idea, as it will give everyone
a place-where he can entertain _ his
friends and relatives. ‘The room will
be beautifully decorated and made very
attractive. The piano will be put in
there, a new Victrola is on the way.
comfortable chairs will be provided and
beautiful rugs will be placed on the
floor. If you like to — play “checks”
there will be plenty of boards.

Invite your friends to come up for
commencement and use this room
whenever you like. Mr. Miles expects
to make this a permanent place for rest
and loafing fer the students next year.

GREATER DAVIDSON
CLUB MEETS

The first regular meeting of the
Greater Davidson Club was called by
President Miller Saturday morning af-
ter chapel. We were fortunate to se-
cure Coach Fetzer to make a short talk,
explaining how the club can benefit ath;
letics in the college. The schedule of
the different teams put out by this col-
lege is as hard if not harder than that
of any College or University in the
South. In football, especially is this
true. Under these conditions and con-
sidering the size of the student body the
stand made is remarkable.

A good fighting team can always be
made rom the material on hand, but
this is not sufficient. ‘To maintain our
high standing it is necessary to have
more good athletes and this is where
the club can effectively serve the col-
lege. Let every man who goes out
from here this year find a good football.
baseball, basketball or track man and
get him lined up for next year. If you
are unable to definitely persuade him,
send his name in to Mr. Miles or Coach
Fetzer and they will help. Every col-
lege and university in this section is
planning a revival in athletics and we
tre not going to be behind. Everybody
get out and work to get the men here
and the rest will be taken care of.

ALUMNI, THE “Y” WILL BE
WAITING FOR YOU, MAY

The Y. M. C. A. is to install an in-
formation bureau at the station and as

VARSITY CAN WIN
A GAME SOMETIMES

In a rather one-sided game, the var-
sity beat the all-star class team 10-1.
There were no spectacular plays on
either side with the exception of “Pat”
Robson's pretty stop in the third inning.
“String Bean” McAskill shone swith
the stick, but the less said about his
base stealing. the better. Cathey did
valiant work in the box, striking out
Capt. Boswell three times and “Rail-
road” Clark once. Miley, pitching for
the varsity, was relieved by Clarke, who
was hit hard and freely. Ratchford did
the best batting for the varsity, getting
three hits.

The all-star team showed that with
more practice they could give the var-
sity a little boost. On the team we
find four Freshmen, three Juniors, and
two Seniors. ,

In the box Cathey struck them out

smile and we will all have a good time, with his “wicked curve.” Behind the

this commencement.

bat Rooster McFadden stopped the ball

[by various methods,

On first, Ratch-
ford caught everything that came his
way. "Pat" Robson held down second
in great style, “Look at that leg” is
what they all say about Miller on short.
“Slow but sure’ Black completed the
million dollar infield, Out in left field
“Doc” McConnell creeped up on the
balls that came his way and demon-
strated his wonderful “peg.” “Lazarus”
Montgomery effectively held down his
job in center, Last but jnot least we
find “String Bean” MeAskill in’ right,
giving advice freely and holding down
his position to perfection.
