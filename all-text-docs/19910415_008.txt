A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Weight Room

By Walter Wray

Having noticed the arbitrary
sign reading “no hats allowed” in
the new weight room, or Lapko
Room, of Baker Sports Complex, I
had wondered who was respon-
sible-for this attempted infringe-
ment on my personal rights. Dis-
counting myself as an apathetic
individual, I innocently inquired
to the work-study student as to the
purpose of the above mentioned
rule of “no hats”. She responded
that Terry Holland had put up the
sign and that he had done so stating
that, “to wear a hat erodes the in-
tegrity of the Sports Complex.”
Her answer was simple enough,
but illicited chuckles in both of us.
Somewhat dissatisfied, I would
continue wearing my San Fran-
cisco Giants hat during my efforts

to “get big.”

Some six months later while
striding into the Lapko side of the
weight room, I spied the man re-
sponsible for the no hats allowed
policy. He too was trying to get
big, but was not sporting a topper.
Anticipating conflict, my pulse
raced. Ambling overtome, the tall
man kindly recommended that I
remove my hat. Then came the
reply that I hadn’t known existed
in me, “No, I will not remove my
hat.”

“Yes, you will.”

With newly found resolve, I
demanded to hear the reasoning
behind his command. I briefly
considered the possible punish-
ments for insubordination that I
vaguely retained from my days in
public high school. Now came his

reply. First, he felt that to wear a
hat in the weight room was unsafe
because a “spotter” would neglect
his duty of protecting his partner in
order.to pick-up a fallen hat. Sec-
ondly, he argued that a hat displays
a lack of commitment to purpose.

Later, when he attacked me at
the water fountain, he introduced
himself as Terry Holland, the new
Athletic Director. “Hi, I’m Wal-

_ ter.” I sensed he liked my spirited

defense of my hat, but was irritated
athaving hisauthority challenged.
He continued to argue that at Vir-
ginia they had the same policy and
no one complained. He felt that
because a hat was an unnecessary
piece of clothing it was superfu-
lous. I argued that it was more
unsafe for me to lift without a hat
because of my long hair. He sug-

gested I wear a head band. Hell no.
Who ever established that
Davidson students needed to be
commited to their activities any-
how?

“You don’t wear a hat in class,
do you?” he inquired while show-
ing his ignorance. Icorrectedhim,
pointing out that both men and
women wear hats in class.

“Terry, you have got to change
with the times.” He felt that wear-
ing a hat showed a lack of respect
toward others. I feel that he shows
a lack of respect for our personal
rights in this manner. There is
really no safety issue involved here,
itis simply a question of imposing
one’s outdated and skewed per-
sonal preferences onto others. The
argument continued.

Thoughts on the "Politically Correct" Debate

By Jim Carswell

There has been a lot of talk
lately about the so-called “polit-
cally correct” movement becom-
ing popular on college campuses.
Time had a big article titled “Up-
side Down in the Groves of Aca-
deme” a couple of weeks ago,
and even The Davidsonian in-
cluded an editorial on the subject.
The general consensus is that
“P.C.” is bad, though there was a
sort of a rebuttal to the Time ar-
‘ticle in an essay the following
weck. The naysayers oppose the
“vicious scourge of censorship
and oppression . . . running loose
in the halls of academia.”

And they are right to do so.
Kicking a guy out of school be-
cause he got drunk and yelled
some racist things late at night is
just silly. Some have said that
Brown University (which is where
this whole thing happened, incase

you have not been keeping up witht
the news) denied this fellow his
first amendment rights. But this
episode is too absurd to warrant
any discussion of the Constitution
- he was just drunk and acting
stupid. (God knows we’ ve all done
that!)
The opposition to the P.C.
movement cites actions at other
colleges, too. The University of
Delaware will not let a professor
take a grant from a company it
views as racist, and, in California,
some are trying to ban such phrases
as “‘a nip in the air” because they
might offend Japanese and other
minority students. These people
are going too far in their effort to
enlighten us. And in their zeal,
they have forgotten an old but
proven principle: You Cannot
Legislate Morals. Trying to force
awareness of bias on people will
only lead to backlash. Time and

A Brief Reflection of Times Now

““What dire offense from
amorous Causes springs,
What mighty contests rise from
trivial things... .“

Well, Pope (not the Italian)
sure knew what he was talking
about. You want to talk about
raising the collective ire? Try
writing the conservative political
column for your local weekly. It
ain’teasy, folks. If we hadanickel
for every armchair columnist who
thought he or she had a clue, we
could buy and sell you all a thou-
sand times over. Such.is life. Just
try thinking up new and provoking
insults on a weekly basis. Keep in
mind that, although offending
PCP’ ers (political correctness, for

the politically inert) may not be a '

factor in our editing decisions, a
libel suit is something we could do
without. Remember when we
called you all a bunch of slack-

jawed troglodytes. You could all
still get together and file a class-
action suit, you know. Hurry up
and get your revenge before the
statute of limitations runs out.
Maybe Margeand Homer Simpson
are getting their lawyer(youknow,
the one whose card turns into a
sponge when you put itin water) to
file a copyright infringement
against us for the troglodyte allu-
sions. Who knows what evil lurks
in the hearts of men? Ha, ha, there
we go again; a nongender-inclu-
sive sexist chauvinist male refer-
ence to men. You see, therefore,
what kinds of risks we take each
week to bring everyone humor and
happiness, you Perrier sipping, new
Spring L. L. Bean catalogue re-
ceiving, lovers of great books
you’ ve never really read.

Sadly, this opus marks our last
légitimate column of the spring
term. (Yeah, we bet you’re sad
aboutthat.) Anyway, as we realize
that last week’s column has proba-
bly elicited at least one response

The Davidsonian are part of the
reaction against this movement,
one that originated with high ide-
als and admirable goals.

The problem is that the United
States is a sexist, racist, and clas-
sistsociety. Even in 1991, women
only make sixty five cents for
every dollar that men make in
comparable jobs, a higher per-
centage of blacks live in poverty
than whites, and race riots occur
in New York City (remember
Bensonhurst). Ourculture is sick,
and we refuse to find a cure, or
even to look for the cause of the
illness.

Most of us, anyway. The
original “politically correct” re-
alized that many of the problems
in America, in all of Western cul-
ture, originate in lack of under-
standing.. Whites cannot com-
prehend the struggle that blacks
went through, just to be

vilifying us, we thought we'd take
an entirely different approach
(since we couldn’t reply) and
publish a RETROSPECTIVE!!!!
Yes, that hallowed literary con-
vention known for its ability to
leap tall word requirements in a
single bound. So useful is the
form, that you may not read an-
other original word after this para-
graphends. But you probably will.
So on with the show . . . and we’ll
start with Senator Helms. (Unfor-
tunately, we can’t find a copy of
that article, so you’ll just have to
relive that joy in your memory.)

It took us until Birk 7 to state
what should already have been
obvious about our column. “Warn-
ing: The Polemicist General has
determined that the following col-
umn violates scholastically ac-
cepted politically correct thought.
Abandon hope, all ye who enter . .
this isn’t PC.”

And don’tthink we didn’t take
a little flak now and then, Even in
the good old days (you know, the

considered equal. Men refuse to
recognize the fact that they have
kept women locked in the kitchen
for centuries.. Straights don’t
understand gays. Christians don’t
understand Jews. Westernersdon’t
understand the rest of the world.

By promoting the literature and
culture of the so-called minorities,
the P.C. movement has striven to
foster understanding, and, to be
trite, love among all people. Read-
ing Malcolm X shows how achild-
hood of racial disadvantage led to
his actions. Attending a recital of
Indian music proves that Eastern
culture has merits as well. Using
sex-inclusive language reminds us,
ever so gently, that women con-
tribute to society as well. Too
often, those of us in “the majority”
forget these seemingly self-evident
truths.

And we have an obligation,
indeed a duty to remember that

opposed to the bad old days in
which you currently live) we
weren’t afraid of criticism.

The stated purpose of this col-
umn was to provoke thought, but
that didn’t stop us from throwing
inmindless humor once ina while:
“Be that word our sign of parting,
babe or fiend!” I shrieked, up-
Starting—

“Get thee back into the tempest
and the Night’s Plutonian shore!
Leave no black page as a token of
that lie thy soul hath spoken!

Leave my peaceful quiet un-
broken—quit thy face from outmy
door!

Take thy beak from out my
heart, and take thy trash from off
my floor, Quoth the womyn,

ions right or wrong. We’re right

dents, right?”

“No. It is for the whole college
community. I feel that as an ad-
ministrator, I must be able to make
the rules.”

“Don’t you think that those
policies should be able to be re-
viewed by those who you repre-
sent and by those who you work
for?” .

“Yes, but I feel strongly about
this issue and do not feel it restricts
anyone’s rights.”

“Are you saying that you would
be willing to lose your job over
something as absurd as your no
hats policy in the weight room?” I
asked.

“Yes, said Terry, “I guess I
would, if that’s what itcomes down

to.”

everyone counts from the white to
the black, the man to the woman,
the American to the Iraqi. This is
the basis of the “politically cor-
rect” movement. .Maybe the name
should be changed to “politically
aware” or even “humanly aware.”
It sounds better, and describes the
attitude more clearly.

The pointis thateveryone must
strive to understand all the mem-
bers of the (trite again) human |
family. The president of Brown
should not have to force tolerance
on unruly students. That fellow,
like all of us, should make a deter-
mined effort to become aware. As
citizens of the United States, we
have the right to think and say
anything we want, butas members
of the human race we have an ob-
ligation to love and help each other.
Make the free choice to become
“humanly aware.” It’s the “cor-
rect” thing to do.

you correct. All it exemplifies is
that African Americans have a
plurality of opinions on the prob-
lems facing America. Notice, I did
notsay confronting African Ameri-
cans, but all Americans, because
our problems are America’s prob-
lems.

The problems confronting
African Americans should not
engender guilt among Whites and
should not be manipulated to serve
that purpose*-- guilt is an ephem-
eral emotion that does not make
foreffective public policy. Idonot
believe that it is White guilt, or
guilt at all that many African
Americans want, but compassion
and respect. Your statement, al-
though I do not believe it was rac-
ist, was distasteful and lacked both
compassion and respect.
