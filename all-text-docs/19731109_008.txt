THE END OF PINBALL?

Pete Celantano pounds on a pinball game to take out his
frustrations as Bonnie Henesy watches. Unless this, and other
more serious acts of vandalism to the machines are stopped,
there is the possibility that the College Union may be forced to

remove the machines altogether.

Union Confronts
Pinball Vandalism

By CHARLES KENNON
Staff Writer

The future of the pinball
machines in the College Union
has been thrown into jeopar-
dy.

Wanton acts of vandalism
against the machines have in-
creased sharply in the past
few weeks. For example, the
glass on several machines has
broken, and_ the
machines’ wall sockets
ruined.

To halt such acts before the
extent of damage becomes
more substantial, the execu-
tive committee of .the Union
Board met andformulatednew
policy guidelines for using the
Union pinball facilities.

Assistant Director of the
Union Duff Bruce explained
the move saying, ‘We will
keep the machines where they

are for now, but we'll keep an
eye out for outsiders to see if
they are responsible for the
damage.

“If they are the ones respon-
sible, then they will be barred
from the Union,” he said.

He added that if the Union
Board found that students
were involved, then the
machines might well be
removed from the Union en-
tirely.

Measures to tighten up
security include locking the
back door more often, and

machines
properly.

Bruce urged all Davidson
students to take better care of
‘the pinball machines if they
in fact want them to remain a
part of the Union’s available
activities.

(Ed. note: This is the second
of a four-part series focusing
on the JYA experience. This
story is from a_ returning
senior who spent his junior
year studying in France;
these are his reactions to that

experience. )

I’m continually amazed that
more Davidson students don’t
take advantage of the JYA-
France opportunity offered
them, but I’m looking at it
from the tail end of nine
months over there.

A bias toward the program
and France in _ general
develops quickly in that time.
and the benefactors of those
days abroad find it hard to un-
derstand any
felt by someone who has the
chance to go.

It’s hard to explain the total
positive feeling about JYA toa
freshman or , and
in trying, a Montpellier
veteran usually ends up
making a fool of himself.

Unfortunately, slides of
Paris and vineyards and
narrow cobblestone streets
and incredible stories of six
and eight course meals convey
only the aspects of JY Asimilar
to any whirlwind two week
American Express tour of that
country.

Veteran JYA people hate to
sound like your next-door
neighbor who just got back
from the Continent, loaded
down with wine and perfume
and a three-inch miniature of
the Eiffel tower.

These outer trappings are a
small part of JYA, but it is im-
possible to explain the mental
effect of a school year abroad,
which is the most lasting and
important part of it.

The difference between a
year of study at Montpellier
and an extended vacation
besides the study aspect lies in
cultural communication, a
concept that can’t be grasped
until it is experienced.

A tourist may sit down in a
cafe and manage to order a
beer. Unless someone there
speaks English, he will end up
quaffing his brew in obscurity
and return to the hotel in time

The college invests much of
the endowment fund in stocks
and bonds. As of June, 1973,
$9,120,000 was invested in
common stocks, $4,442,000 in
bonds, and $230,668 in
preferred stocks (all figures

The total market value of
the Davidson endowment as of

the book value was $16,236,978.

to catch the afternoon tour of
the city. He’s an alien and
knows it, not that there’s
anything wrong with that.

Nothing wrong with his
inability to do more, but there
is something so much more
right with being able to talk to
the bartender and feel com-
fortable in the surroundings.

It’s an undefinable feeling of
pride that somehow increases
enthusiasm toward the year.
Half of last year’s JYA-
France students have definite
plans for returning after
graduation, One couldn't wait
that long; he repacked his
bags three weeks ago and left.

Still, even the most ardent
backers of the program don’t
seem to be able to tell why
their support is so fervent.

What you're left with is a
group of seniors telling un-
derclassmen to go JYA-
France, but when the prospect
asks why, the chagrined
senior has to say he can’t ex-
plain it, it can only be ex-
perienced. Not a very good
sales pitch, I agree, but an
honest one.

As for outer trappings, the
only medium of com-
munication left, we can only
say the same things that can
be read in a book or seen in
“‘Gidget Goes To Paris.”

The Alps dwarf the Ap-
palachians, and even the
Pyranees host some excellent

Riviera are _ distinctly
possible, and more than once
we took on all-day journey to
Barcelona to see the world’s
only white gorilla in the zoo

Daily life is a combination of
classes at the somewhat
sterile-looking university,
meals at the run-for-your-life
student restaurants, and a late
afternoon ‘‘pastis’’ at places
like the Bar Miami.

With the help of one of the
light-weight, cheap motorized
bicycles whose riders display
superb skill and complete
foolishness with their death-
defying maneuvers in rush
hour traffic, no point in the
city is more than 10 minutes
away.

No need to even mention the
bread and wine; one member
of the group went through a
two-week withdrawal period
when he returned and faced a
peanut butter sandwich on flat
bread.

We crusaders for the David-
son year in France program
find ourselves continually

ted in our efforts to ex-
plain our enthusiasm.

Unfortunately, the more we
try, the more we realize that
the experience is inexplicable,
and the more we find our-
selves reverting to the weak
plea, ‘“You just have to go to
