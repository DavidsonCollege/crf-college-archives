Resignation Reasons

Rick von Unwerth. who
resigned from the IFC pres-
idency Monday night, issued
the following statement:

“For the past eleven
months, it has been my
great privilege to serve Da-
vidson College and her stu-
dents as President of the Inter-
fraternity Council.

“I have never failed, during
these months, to be grateful for
the honor nor mindful of the re-

' sponsibility that fell to me as
a result of my election to this
office. In my capacity as IFC
President, I have attempted to

seek out my duty and discharge .

i it—to serve Davidson's fra:erni-
ties—to the very best of my
abilities.

“Because of my position. I
was appointed, four months ago,
to serve on the Fraternity Eval-
uation Committee. As a mem-
ber of that committee, 1 be-
came one of twelve individuals
asked to consider carefully an
issue of vast and vital import-
ance to Davidson. In that: po-
sition I have likewise attempted
to understand my responsibility,
and to. discharge my obligation
to Davidson within the limita-
tions of my best ability and with
my total energy.

A graduate of Duke’ Univer-
sity, Swain was director of the
Wesley Foundation at the Uni-
versity of North Carolina before
going to Japan.

Swain has been assigned to
the Tokyo post since 1953. The
Student Christian Fellowship
center is operated under the
auspices of the United Church |
of Christ in Japan. According;
to Swain it is a center offering
a variety of study opportunities
to both Christian and non-Chris- |
tian students.

‘About half my time goes into,
teaching, including the neces-
sary preparation time, which
takes about five times as long
in Japanese” says Swain. “The
remaining time is spent in plan-
ning periodic seminars, Jec-'
tures, worship services, and
service projects."

sion of the committee's inquiry
laid the responsibility cn me, as
a participant in that inquiry, to
broaden my concern according-
ly.

“TI have found no more elo- |
quent statement of the dilemma
of the Davidson fraternity man
than these words from the edi-|
tor of the DAVIDSONIAN: ‘Our
concern is not with the relative
standing. of fraternity systems.
Rather our attention is fixed on
the overall impact of fraternities
and the fraternity system on the
life of the Davidson student, the
essence of Davidson College.’

‘With this concern as my fo-
cus. and with the ‘Christian,
democratic, and educational as-
pirations of the College’ written
into our tradition as they are. I
could not, in good conscience,
fail to support the premise the
subsequent evaluation of the
problem and the consequent pro.
posals for salution of the prob-
lem set forth in the committee
report.

“The question, as I see it, is
not whether fraternities are
good or bad, but rather what is
best for Davidson : Our frater-
nity system is a good one, and
for eleven months I have de-
voted my energy to making it
even. better. I do not believe,
however, that a good fraternity
system is the Beall and End-
all of small college society. I
think Davidson can do better:
indeed, must do better if she is
to live up to her aims and goals.

“Finally, I oelieve thal my
stated position is nowhere in
consistent with my obligation as
a member of the Davidson com
munity; nor has it been incon-
sistent with my duty and my de.

| sire to serve Davidson students

| through the fraternity system,
as long as it has been my privi-
lege to do so within the system
as it is‘ presently constituted.

“In my eleven months as
President of the IFC, and in my
four months with the Fraternity
Evaluation Committee, I have
encountered a measure of re-
sponsibility which I have dis-
charged conscientiously, _al-
though not without, error and
oversight in the process. For
my shortcoming, I apologize.

“I will remain firm in my
conviction, however, that the
exclusive fraternity as an insti-
tution can no longer be justified
in perpetrating a tynanny over
the social structure of Davidson
College. and that it must be re-
moved from its throne with all
possible expediency.”

WORKING

VERY WELL

White Extols Placement Tests

“One of the most encouraging
signs of real improvement in our
educational sysiem,"" James B.
Conant, noted educator and for-
mer president of Harvard, said
about the Advanced Placement
Program. “Great deals!" is a
Davidson freshman’s comment
on the same subject.

The Advanced Placement Pro-
gram is a project begun in 1955
of the College Entrance Exam-
ination Board as a means of
eliminating a waste of time and

energy and of enabling a col-
lege freshman to avoid dupli-
cating a course he has taken

and done well in while in high
school.

By taking the Advanced Place-
ment Examination he may re-
ceive credit for this course whea
he enters college.

There are 12 Advanced Place.
ment Examinations—American
History, Biology, Chemistry,
English, European History.
French German, Latin 4 and 5,
Math, Physics and Spanish —
each of which takes approxi-
mately three hours. They are
usually taken at the student’s
high school and are graded by
a committee appointed by the
Educational Testing Service.

After being graded on a five
point scale (normally taken to
read: S-high honors; 4-honors;
3-good: 2-credit; 1-no credit) the
examinations are returned . to
the high school where they were
taken and the scores are sent
to the college of the student's
choice.

The cost is $5 registration and
$10 per individual test

College policies vary greatly
on the awarding of credit. Most
award credit for grades of 5.
4, or 3, but leave the decision
whether to advance the student
with a score of 2 up to the de-
partment concerned for individ-
ual .evaluation. Other colleges
grant only placement, and a
few grant neither placement or
credit. (Davidson takes 3 as
the grade for department refer-
ence.)

H. Edmunds White, associ-
ated director of admissions, is

enthusiastic about the way the

program has worked out at Da-
vidson. Davidson has been tak-
ing scores for ten years and has
found them, on the whoie, ac-
curate indicators of a student's
achievement.

The growth of the program
has also been encouraging, as
in 1964 there were 5! partici-
pants, 31 of whom got a 3 or bet-
ter, while in 1962 there were
only 12 applicants getting over
a 2.

If the candidate scores a 4
or 5 (or, sometimes, a 3) he is
automatically awarded three
hours and the same number of
quality points.

When asked how students who
have been advanced have re-
sponded, as a whole, in their
classes, White replied that a
study has not been taken on this
subject yet: but the majority
seem to be doing very well, and
only a few are forced to ‘drop
back."

In concluding that “by and
large I think it is working out
very well, and I think it is tre-
mendously important that we
award .a student who has done
college work in high school,”
White concurs with the College
Entrance Examination Board's
contention that ‘‘the Advanced
Placement idea is based on the
assumption that some twelfth
grade students can do college
freshman work, and that
achievement, no matter where
it occurs, should be recognized
and rewarded.”

ignation because, as president
of the IFC, he would be repre-
senting a system which he could
not conscientiously defend, and
would thus be denying the sys-
tem its privilege to state as
completely as possible its stand,
views, and proposals.

“I would like to stress that
Rick is stil! a member of the
Council,’ Sackett. said, ‘and
that I, and the Council accepted
Rick's resignation only because
of the present situation in re-
gard to fraternities, the mem-
bership on the faculty commit-
tee, and Rick's personal convic
tions regarding the situation at
Davidson.”

During the meeting Monday,
all nine representatives present
unanimously supported the pre-
liminary -report by the Frater-
nity Evaluation Committee
which removed all social func-
tions from the IFC. Sackett
commented that its advantages
were a larger budget and with
a set budget. it could schedule
farther in advance than had the
IFC.

After the Evaluation Commit-
tee’s report was distributed, a
representative pointed out that
there was not an authoritative
spokesman for the fraternities,
pointing out von Unwerth’s in-
ability to represent the fraterni-
ties conscientiosly.

Yon Unwerth then read a pre-
pared statement of his position
and suggested that elections be
held on March 22 to elect a new
president. Sackett proposed a
counter motion that the date for
elections remain as Set on April
12. The counter proposal was
amended fo include the election
of a spokesman to the. faculty
committee.

Sackett explained his counter-
proposa), ‘I supported the de-
layed election of the officers of
the IFC because I feel that con-
tinulty. of membership. on the
faculty committee will mean a
great deal in the committee’s
being ablo to best dacide on rec
ommendations to submit to the
Trustees; and a consistent stand
by the fraternities needs to be
expressed to this committee.
Had elections been held March
22, the IFC representatives to
the faculty committee would
change ‘in the middle of their
deliberations.

“The results of whatever the
commitice and faculty may de-
cide will be known by April 6.

The new officers of the IFC will
enter into the new year on April
17 without being handicapped by
having to share the responsibil-
ity of those results. I feel a
more positive program and atti-
tude will be the result of enter-
ing office after the decisions are
made.”

After Sackett’s appointment
as spokesman, the ambiguity of
the IFC President's situation be.

Fraternity Evaluation |
Gets Faculty Remarks

By BOB HOWARD
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Faculty and administra-
tion reaction to the Frater-
nity Evaluation Committee
report has been as varied as
that of the committee itself.

Dr. J. W. Reid, professor of
geography and geology, said he
had “not been in sympathy with
efforts to do away with fraterni-
ties. There have been some er-
rors in the ways fraternities
have been doing things but not
enough to justify completely do-
ing away with them,”

Robert T. Stone, assistant to
the president, believed the’ em-
phasis of the report should have

been on how to strengthen the
system. ‘‘People have a right
to have a club and decide on
its membership."" he contended.

On the other side of the fence
was Dr. Philip B. Secor, assist-
ant professor of political sci-
ence, who thought the reoort
was ‘“‘moving in the right direc-
tion.”

‘I was encouraged when I
read it. I am in favor of any-
thing in the direction of abolish-
ing social fraternities and this
‘fs certainly in that direction I
am sorry it doesn't go any fur-
ther.”

But turning to the faculty,
Secor felt it would be ‘‘some
time before any definite action
will be taken.’ ;

Dr. F. W. Bliss, English pro-
fessor, called fraternities ‘‘ob-
solescent’’ and “‘holdovers from
the Nineteenth Century with
very little place in the life of a
college in the Twentieth Cen-
tury.”

“The college exists to develop
the life of the mind rather than’
to produce socially adjusted peo-
ple.”

Bliss criticized fraternities for.
“emphasizing social adjustment ;
and fulfillment unduly, encour. .
aging snobbery, and discourag- |-
ing individuality.”

“Sympathetic” described the
feelings of Prof. W. Brown Pat- :
terson, assistant professor of

‘history. Patterson added, “The

projected changes in the repori |
were well thought out.”

Though not specifically en
dorsing the Committee’s report,
Dr. D. D. Rhodes, professor of
religion and philosophy, com-
mented, “I believe quite firmly
that a radical revision is need-
ed.””

When asked what action the
faculty might take, Rhodes re-
marked, ‘Predicting the action
of a faculty is like predicting
when the action of the next war
is coming.”

“The faculty is in the posi-
tion I am in—they will want to
study the reports.”

Prof. A. G Griffin, econom-
ies professor, saw ‘‘a little in-
consistency in having a true fra-
ternity on the basis of one
week's acquaintance.”

Dr. G. L. Abernathy of. the
Philosophy Department said, ‘a
change is long overdue” and |
‘tan experiment is in order.”

Dr. .W. B. Hight of the ‘Coun-
seling Office commended ithe
committee for its work. He
added, “Any time you dig at the
roots of the status quo someone
will howl. It promises to be a
very interesting spring.”

Professors J. T. Kimbrough,
E. A. Beaty, and Donald B.
Plott were also contacted but
reserved comment.

“Alexander Nevsky’
Reviewed By Durand

By MICHEL OURAND
A Review

Though the two movies which have already been
shown in the Film-Friends program are most im-
portant because they are landmarks in the history of
cinema, one has to admit that to-day they seem a
little out-of-date. But Alexander Nevsky, the next
movie to be shown in the Film-Friends program
Tuesday and Wednesday, baffles time and cannot
disappoint any expectation.

This grand epic, made 37 years ago and consti-
tuting with Cuirassier Potemkine and Ivan The Ter-
rible the great Eisenstein’s historical trilogy, has a
very simple theme.

in 1242. almost all Russia had succumbed under
the invasion of the powerful Order of the Teutonic
Knights, when Alexander. Nevsky, Prince of Nov-
gorod, stopped and defeated them.in a single and
fierce battle on the frozen lake Peipus.

Eisenstein gave his movie a triple dimension First.
he developed the historical event of the defense of
Novgorod. Then, the movie was enlarged geographi-
cally to all Russia, the victory becoming a symbol
of freedom for the whole country. Finally, it was
even broadened in time, ending.on a bold warning
to any invading nation which might be temped to
imitate the - Teutonic Knights.

We must think that in 1938, when the movie was
first shown, Hitler had started to invade Eastern
Europe; and even now. in the Cold War, the conclu-
sion may still sound unpleasantly significant for cer-
tain nations... .

Doubtless, the most exciting part of the movie is
the battle itself when thousands of warriors meet in
an indescribable and monumental melee. But all
the movie is alive with extraordinary and unforget-
table images: the savage scene of the Teutonic
Knights burning children in a kind of expiatory sac-
rifice; the benediction of the Knights before the bat-
tle; their departure to the final assault, as the cam-
era insists on their slow and invinsible heaviness;
the bitter loitering on the battle-field. when the Teu-
tonic pride is replaced with the flight of the Priest
or the dyings’ moans; the faces of the Teutonic lead-
ers; and so many other fascinating scenes in which
the artistic virtuosity of Eisenstein’s camera that is
able to embrace a whole battle or to tarry marvel-
ously on faces and objects is admirably supported
and helped by Prokofieff’s music.

To say more would be to reduce the interest of a
movie that all students should go to see. It is NOT
esoterically intellectual or philosophical; but it has
the advantage of adding to a simple and powerful
poetry the entertainment and the relaxation that
any of the James Bond movies would give to their
enthusiastic audience of Davidson students.

Before Alexander Nevsky will be shown a short
subject: Etoile De Mer, by Man Ray, based on a
poem by Robert Desnos. This Parisian poet, born in
1900, exerted a cardinal influence on the group of
the “Surrealists.” :

He admirably succeeded in the expression of
dreams into words, and in the unexpected associa-
tions of words or images which could spring from
the poet’s unconsciousness. He was also one of the
great poets of the Resistance, and paid his engage-
ment with his life in 1945.
