Davidsonian Picks Wildcats
To Finish First in Big South

By Bruce Balestier
& Robert Grubb

After suffering through a
dreadful 4-24 season in his initial
year at the helm of the Davidson
basketball program two years ago,
head coach Bob McKillop parlayed
an infusion of young talent into a
10-19 record last year.

Thatseason ended witha surge
of momentum, as the youthful
Wildcats (the team started four
freshmen and a sophomore) won
three of their last four games and
nearly knocked offeventual cham-
pion Coastal Carolina in the semi-
finals of the Big South Tourna-
ment, '

Despite losing starting strong
forward James Marsh (he returned
to Germany), this year’s team re-
turns four starters, and has experi-
ence at all five positions. If the
team comes together, this should
be the breakthrough year for the
program.

The point guard position is
locked up by incumbent Pat Hol-
loway. Holloway, a 6’1" sopho-
more, is lightning-quick with the
basketball, and arguably the finest
athlete in the league. Last year was
a learning year for Holloway; he
averaged 9 points per game, but
hurt the team’s chances with a3 to
1 turnover to assist ratio.

This year; however, Holloway
returns to Davidson a different
player; an improved jump. shot,
with range:to the three-point line,
and more mature decision-making
should make Holloway a steady
leader at the point.

Holloway will receive help at
the point from ‘starting off-guard
Jason Zimmerman and senior cap-
tain Paul Denmond, both of whom
saw time there last season. In addi-
tion, 6’3" freshman Frank Harris,
from New York City, is a fast,
flashy player who could see time
there as well.

‘Zimmerman returns atthe two-
guard slot after a fine freshman

season. He led the team with 12.5
points per game and was one of the
finest free-throw shooters in the
nation. His .863 percentage at the
line ranked him 13th in the nation
and was best among freshmen.

Zimmerman ranked second in
the Big South in 3-point field goal
percentage a year ago and is a
constant threat from three-point
range. If the Wildcats can get
consistent offensive outputat both
the big forward and center spot,
Zimmerman could punish defenses
by knocking down the open pe-
rimeter jump shot.

Denmond is likely to be the
team’s sixth man. After averaging
13.4 points per game as a sopho-
more, Denmondtailed off last year,
contributing 7.3 ppg. He is an ex-
tremely talented offensive player
who is capable both of penetrating
to the basket and hitting the out-
side shot, but was often reluctant
last year to take the initiative in
games. Denmond’s ‘experience
gives the Wildcats a steadying in-
fluence off the bench at guard. Co-
captain Sterling Freeman is a de-
fensive specialist who started 26

- games over his first three years; he

will also provide leadership in the
backcourt.

Presently, sophomore Janko
Narat sees likely to start again at
the small forward position. Though
hampered by a lack of defensive
quickness, the 6’6"Narat is a tal-
ented scorer. Last year he aver-
aged 8.3 points and:4.4: rebounds
per game, but sometimes made
poor decisions on the court. His
shot selection and free-throw shoot-
ing (66% last year) both seem to be
improved so far this season. If Narat
can make the open three-pointer
(he shot just 28% on three-pointers
last season), the ‘Cats will have
three viable three-point shooters in
the starting five.

6’6" sophomore Scott Alford
may also see time at the 3-spot, but
could also play the other front-

court positions. He scored 22 points
in his debut last year against Cen-
tral Connecticut, and played in the
‘Cats’ first nine games, but missed
most of the remainder of the year
after dislocating his kneecap. Al-
ford is likely the best perimeter
shooter on the team and his great
ball-handling ability for his size
presents matchup problems for op-
posing defenses.

Fellow 6’6" sophomore
Ronald Horton also lends the team
versatility at the 3 and 4 spots.
Horton is less effective than Al-
ford from the outside, but also
handles the ball well. His 1990-91
campaign was also abbreviated by
injury; after playing in the first
seven games, he missed the rest of
the year with a knee injury.

The biggest question mark for
the Wildcats is at the power for-
ward position. Marsh, last year’s
starter, offset his offensive short-
comings with fine defense and
rebounding. He led Davidson with
6.2 boards per game. 6’8" senior
co-captain Paul Drobnitch is a
similar player. While his offensive
skills are limited, he is a consum-
mate defender and rebounder.

~ Drobnitch got the start last Satur-

day in the ‘Cats’ first exhibition
against Cherry Point, but will likely
see reduced playing time as fresh-
man George Spain gains experi-
ence. “
Spain, a widebody at 6’7" and
235 pounds, contributed 12 points,

‘9 rebounds and4 blocks a gameas
a senior at Spring Valley High

School in Columbia, -S.C. His
shooting percentage was an excep-
tional68%. Spain has been apleas-
ant surprise in the first month of
practice. He has been aggressive at
bothends of the floor, and excelled
in the first Red-Black scrimmage,

’ pouring in 18 points on 8-11 shoot-

ing from the floor. Spain will also
see time behind Detlef Musch at

Cats to F ight Coastal, Radford

For The Conference Crown

By Bruce Balestier
& Robert Grubb

Here is a look at the Wildcats’
competition in Big South play this
year:

RADFORD

Junior Doug Day, the leading
scorer in the Big South at 20.2 ppg
last year, heads a list of 4 returning
starters for the Highlanders. Day is
a phenomenal outside shooter (he
ranked third in the nation with 3.7
three-pointers per game last sea-
son) who has spells where he sim-
ply cannot miss.

Davidson found this out the
hard way last January in Radford,
when Day’s 30 points (7-11 three-
pointers) led the Highlanders to a
78-72 win. Radford’s primary
challenge will be to replace gradu-
ated. All-Big South center Ron
Shelburne (13.7 ppg), the school’s
all-time leading scorer. 6’6" senior
Pete Reece is expected to take
Shelburne’s spot in the starting
five. 6’2" transfer guard Brian
Schmall, whoayeraged 15 pointsa
game for former Big South mem-
ber Augusta last year, also should
contribute.

COASTAL CAROLINA

The Chants made the nation
aware for the first time of the Big
South last March when they scared
Indiana in a first-round NCAA
game, trailing by three with two

minutes left, and losing by just ten.

‘That team raced through the
conference with 13-1 mark and
finished 24-8. Forward Tony
Dunkin, the Big South player of
the year in each of his first two
years, returns, but without three of
his teammates.

Center DuWayne Cheatam,
off-guard Brian Penny and point
guard Robert Dowdell all gradu-
ated, removing 40 points and 16
rebounds per game from the team
in the process. Senior J.J. Foster
(3.5 ppg) is a question mark at the
point, and the only other returning
Starter is forward Eddie Lesaine
(6.8 ppg).

Coastal apparently parlayed
their tournament success into the
finest recruiting class in the con-
ference, Dennis Pierre,a6’7" trans-
fer from Cincinnati, might con-
tribute immediately in the post.
CAMPBELL

The Camels played their way
toa last-place Big South finish (3-
11, 9-19) last year, but lost two-
thirds of their starting frontcourt
before the first game. 6’6" junior
forward Mark Mocnik (a team-
high 13.5 ppg in 1990) and 6’7"
sophomore forward Billy Ellison
each return after missing the entire
1990-91 season with injuries.
