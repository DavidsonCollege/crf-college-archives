Demure Thinking

Davidson’s Student Council placed
prudence above facile possibilities this
week in deciding to lay aside the bal-
lots on the question of repeal of the
Student Body Regulations.

The details of the referendum were
miserably handled in every instance,
except in the final decision not to
count the ballots.

After unanimously approving Paul
Marion's motion last week that the
referendum be held. the council held
no meeting to read the question to the
student body. Instead, a general an-
nouncement by the college chaplain
that voting on the regulations would
be conducted was made in Thursday
chapel last week.

Yet, last spring, on matters hardly
as important or consequential as the
repeal of the regulations, proposals
were read in a closed student body
meeting, and ballots were secured at
polling places manned by council
members.

Ballots in this week’s voting were
arbitrarily placed in the pew racks
of the auditorium before chapel. Many
Students erroneously thought they
were taking part in an informal opin-
ion poll—previous polls have been

taken in a similarly irregular manner,
despite constant admonitions that the
Tuesday vote was termed an official
referendum.

Instead of listening to his eminence,
Ludwig von Mises, during. the assem-
bly program. many students spent the
time discussing and marking the hal-
lots. Then, after von Mises ran over-
time. John Burks attempted a sensi-
ble, yet hurried. explanation of the
question to no avail.

Several. students scoffed up extra
ballots and stuffed. them into council
members’ hands which were used in-
stead of ballot boxes at the door.

After waiting a good 30 hours be-
fore meeting to tabulate the ballots,
the council wisely reconsidered their
actions and decided on proper pro-
cedure before they even counted the
votes.

' We are assured now that the coun-
cil wishes to be prudent in its affairs.

Although it is unfortunate that the
irregularities during the past week did
occur, the indiscreet actions of the
council should serve to remind each
member to think much more demurely
in the future concerning such mat-
ters of import.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Senior McGuire Points Up,
‘Good Aspects’ Of ROTC !

Dear Editor:

The ROTC Department has
been the object of much critic-
ism both this year and last. It
appears to me that in all fair-
ness to the ROTC program it
should be pointed out that there
are many good aspects of this
program which deserve merit.
I would like to point out a few
of these aspects.

Let us start with those stu-.

dents who take only the required
two years, hoping then to shut
the army out of their lives. How
great a damage is done to the
lives of these students during
this two year period? A total of
two hours each Tuesday after-
noon, a little time to study be-
fore reviews and writs. and a
rifle cleaning every few weeks.
This is damaging?

It never seems to occur to
many students that these two
years of training might actually
be doing them some good. Simi-
lar to the child that screams
upon having to take castor oil.
only to find out later that it has
done him some good. these stu-
dents may some day be thank-
ful.

This is especially true in light
of the present world situation.
These men may find it impos-
sible to shut the army out of
their lives. And besides the mili-
tary aspect, this training does
broaden one’s experiences and
thus contributes to his over-all
education. if not to his academic
education.

Now let us turn our attention

to those men who take the ad-.

vanced program. It seems safe
to assume that these men see
some value in the program or
they would not be taking it.

To some it is an extra $40 a
month, to others a way to fulfill
one’s obligation to his country
as an officer instead of a pri-
vate, and to still others a tem-

porary job after college or even
a career.

“Many of these men would not
be taking advantage of whatever
value they have seen in advanc-
ed ROTC if they had not first
been required to see what was
offered. In this case, then, the
major criticism of the ROTC
program, a two year require-
ment, has been a valuable boon
to these men.

Admittedly the ROTC program
is not perfect, but there aren't
many things in this world that
are, It is valuable to those men
who take the advanced program,
and I feel not overly damaging
or degrading to those students
who take only the required two
years.

This year there have been
many changes (check last
week’s DAVIDSONIAN) which
make the first two years more
enjoyable and beneficial to all
Students, and I would not be
surprised if there were more
changes in the future.

In conclusion it seems that the
ROTC program is not only just-
ified but a very worthwhile or-

Dear Editor:
THE DAVIDSONIAN certain-

ly has been doi p
y en doing an excellent i The professor's wife and

job as the news and. editorial

voice of the student body. How- ;

ever, we were disappointed in
your recent coverage of the in-
stallation of a new phone booth
in the basement of the Union.

This unexpected. yet import-
ant, change in our daily Nives
has been given only cursory
treatment: the article was hid-
den on the last page, and the
accompanying photograph was
far from adequate. Admittedly,
we were touched by Feature
Writer Varner’s sentimental at-
tachment to “his” booth, but we
might have participated more
fully in the event if your writer
had been less personally invol-
ved.

We cannot help but think that
your negligence with respect to
this article reflects a dangerous

trend in our newspaper. Today, |

our telephone booth is pushed to

page six: tomorrow, we will find ;

such insignificant and unrelated
topics as student peace move-
ments, the arts, books. cyberna-
tion, U. S. foreign policy, and
civil rights polluting our paper.

It Is time to stop and take a
good look at our values. When
we get new candy machines at
the union, let’s see if we can
make page one with some
catchy headline. Like maybe
“Union Gets New Candy Ma-
chines."’

The contributors vary in age,
background, and _ experience,
representing the faculty, the
alumni the student body, and the
public at Jarge. Though both fac-
ulty and alumni are well repre-
sented, the only member of the
present student body with a
piece in this issue is senior Bill
Trotter: and this is the most dis-
appointing featre of the maga-

There is no question that The
Miscellany should serve as a

ers: at the same time it is cru-

to prevent the current long per-

istration,

The board’s seven members

Its chairman, William McChes-

respect of the nation's business
leaders because of his cool-head-

nation’s money supply and cred-

Over-anxious freshmen put

the rushing Greeks stand out-

publicity, or other factors— {: body, and with more exper!-
is clear that the future success ence, Mr. Vick and The Miscel-

of the magazine will depend
largely on both the number
and calibre of student entries.

Keithen ‘65 is clearly the supe-
rior. Mr. McKeithen shows a
fine command of language and
an adept handling of the psy-
chology of his characters.

On the other hand, "The Street.
of the Sovereigns’’ by S. P.
Adinarayan, Visiting Professor
of Psychology here last spring,
fails to convince because of the
unhappy and overworked device
of the converted prostitute.

The section of John Cheever
is excellent: the reviews show.
both insight and good judgment.
The fdea of devoting a section of
each issue to the work of a con-
temporary writer is an excel-
lént one. and IT hope that this
feature will be contiinued.

The poetry is difficult to eval-
uate. Few of the poems are im-
pressive in their totality, but
many contain fine touches. The
closing lines of the second an-
onymous poem. ‘Move. lightly,
go softly: this last shattered
heartbeat/ Marks nothing im-
portant.’ have a haunting sad-
ness about them: German in-
structor Julius Winkler makes
effective use of alliterative tech-
nique in ‘*Merry-Go-Round";
and Charles R. Wyrick ‘61
makes his point with force and
precision in ‘This Is How It Is.“
The most successful of the
poems are “Dogs” by Robert
Canzoneri, professor of Eng-
lish at Ohio State, in which
humor and'humanity are delight-
fully combined.

Though the first issue of The
Miscellany is disappointing in
some respects, the venture is
clearly a promising one. With a
greater range of contributions
from which to draw, with great-

reviews left to be scheduled. ;

Has Christmas changed. or have !?

Each December brings fond memories of the
Christmases of my childhood, but each recent Christ-
mas has been lived as if something were missing.

THE HAPPY WEEK

The rustic happiness of my first Christmases on
a South Carolina farm can never be recaptured.
For a boy there, Christmas week was the most
exciting time of the year.

The air was crisp and clear, the forest inviting
and teeming with wild animals. There was always
time for a romp through the dried forest leaves with
my dog ... and never a worry if both of us became
covered with beggars’ lice.

This was the week I could accompany my father
on a quail hunt, or go with Fred, the old colored
man, to check his rabbit traps.

It was great to ride my bike up to the crdéss-
roads settlement to get the mail at the ramshackle
post office. The nearby general store was stuffy
and smoky from the pot-bellied stove that stood
guard by the cash register. The store was filled with
neighborhood farmers, there to buy, or to idle an
afternoon away.

On the ri e, I would often stop by
the creek, and look wonderingly at the patches of
ice along its edges) In the back of my mind, there

was always the _C would snow for Christ-

mas.

The annual farm Christmas party brought all
the tenants and their families to our house, where
oranges, apples, nuts, and candy were given to all.
To each family went a ham, to each man a bit of
tobacco, to each child, a simple toy.

Just before Christmas Eve, the tree-scouting
party’s mission began. With Mother, and sister Sus-
an, and Fred, we went to find a suitable pine. It was
always a pine for us, nothing else would do. As we
triumphantly brought it home, and decorated it, I
knew the Big Day was very near.

NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS

The family vespers on Christmas Eve, around
the living room’s manger scene, was a brief, but
poignant reminder for a small boy that Christmas
was more than a time of Santa Claus and present
giving.

Our stockings were hung by the fireplace, and
I always made sure the chimney was open before
reluctantly going to bed. Santa’s snack was duly
left beside the hearth, and it was off to sleep for me.

_ Once I was SURE I heard sleigh bells outside my
window, another time reindeer hoofs on the roof.
I never really investigated, though.

COMES CHRISTMAS DAY

_As I was the youngest member of the family,
Christmas dawned earlier for me than anyone else.
We all went together, to see what Santa Claus had
left, and then attacked the presents under the tree.
There was a race to see who could say “Christmas
Gifts” to old Bessie, the cook, first. Annually, Bes-
sie fneaked into the living room and surprised us

Time for lunch would come, and I loved it all
... or, all except the cocoanut in the ambrosia.

And then, it was Christmas afternoon, when I
luxuriated in the Joy of a million new toys, a thou-
sand new interests, to occupy my time for days.

WHERE !S THE MAGIC?

I will be at home for Christmas this year, but
it won’t be the same. The carefree romps in the
woods will be replaced by a bout with a term paper.
The kindly old Fred has died now, his rabbit traps
are 2bandoned. The pi country store occupies a

, where a heat pu
the Franklin stove, pump has replaced

The tenants have all moved away, to the city,
to work in the mills. The farm sits idle and is soon
to become a part of town.

There is hardly time to crowd the Christmas
Eve Vespers in among the host of dances, parties,
dinners. There are no children in the family to
marvel at the mystery of Santa Claus.

Come Christmas Day, presents are opened, and
then stacked in a corner, and Christmas afternoon
seems horribly anti-climactic.

Has Christmas changed, or h ?
think that the answer is found in ve song's teftain,
“Christmas was made for children . . . Children like
you and I.”

the song’s refrain,

I must learn, for one week of the year, to be-
come a child again. Only then may I recapture the
magic of Christmas and the spirit of the Christmas

ason.
