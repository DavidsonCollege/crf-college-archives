The Davidson Wildcat of-
fense showed signs of coming
to life Saturday, but big plays
by the Madison Dukes spoiled
the Cats bid for a homecoming
victory by the score of 17-12.

The first big play of the
game put the Dukes on top

early in the first quarter. With
second and four on their own
30 yard line, Ron Stith took
the ball 70 yards for a touch-
down on a well-executed trap
off-tackle.

Bob Ward made the point
after, and Madison led 7-0.

The Wildcats mounted a
drive on their ensuing posses-
sion, but the field goal at-

A PARAMOUNT PICTURE |

‘Irv Wilson

tempt was wide to the left.
In the second quarter, the
Davidson defense continued to
show its strength as it has for
most of the year. All Madison

could manage was a school .

record:41 yard field goal by
Bob Ward. At the half, Dav-
idson trailed 10-0.

Early in the second half and
with the ball on Davidson 40,
the Dukes called on a big play
again. This time quarterback
Stan Jones faked into the line
and then hit Bucky Knox with
a picture-perfect pass for the
_touchdown. Ward’s conver-
sion made it 17-0.

At this point, the Davidson
offense began to move behind

quarterback Bobby McCar- .
thy. Passes to tight end Larry

Crees and McCarthy scram-

bles carried the ball to Madi-

son 29, where the Cats were

faced with fourth and 10.

With everyone in the stands
awaiting the fake field goal,
holder Sid Osborne ran to the
right and flipped a screen pass
back to Eddie Sitser, who
carried the ball just inside the
ten yard line.

The Cats broke onto the
scoreboard on the very next
play, with McCarthy hitting
Larry Crees for the touch-
down. The extra point was
blocked, and Madison led
17-6.

After the following kickoff,
the Davidson defense, led by

linebackers Paul Andrews and~

Cliff Hester, pinned the Dukes
in their own territory and
Davidson got the ball in good
field position.

Hard running by Pete Leg-
ler carried the ball to’ the
Madison 39, where quarter-
back McCarthy hit receiver

wae.

Mike Harris with a clutch
fourth down pass at the Madi-
son 21. McCarthy carried the
ball to the one yard line, and
Page Walley plunged across
the line for the score.

The two-point conversion
attempt was stopped short,
and the Cats trailed 17-12.

Again, it was up to the
defense to stop Madison and
get the ball, and again they
did. However, the Davidson
offense couldn’t get untrac-
ked, McCarthy was injured on
a rollout, and frantic scram-
bles by backup Sid Osborne
were all the Cats could muster.

While the game appeared
quickly put out of reach, the
Cats continued to show im-
provement. For the first time
since anyone can remember,
the Davidson offense out-
gained an opponent and the
Wildcat defense constantly
held Madison in check.

The Cats try to get into the
win column next Saturday
with a twoo’clock game at
Hampden-Sidney.

trailed 8-0 at half-time. How-
ever, the second half belonged
to the Wildcats.

Halfback Bob Bishop was
the first to cross the goal line

for Davidson as he went 30
yards on an option right.
Wingback Ron Rosenburg
then caught a ten yard pass in
the end zone to put the
Wildcats ahead for the first
time.

On the last play of the
game, fullback Jay Wade put
the icing on the cake with a
dive play over the middle,
resulting in a 20-8 final score.
Brad Huggins called an excel-
lent game for the Cats and
kept the offense moving.

Davidson’s defense, plag-
ued with holes the first half,
came down like an iron curtain
the second half. Rick Kelly
and Corcy Cooper led the way
as each pulled down two inter-
ceptions.

“The team is coming around
after a slow start this season.
We are really playing well
together and we will be able to
finish the remainder of the fall
season strongly,’’ said Coach
Tim Sellers.
