TENNIS, from page 9

Kurtis Zabell all moved uptwo places in the lineup this year,
and obviously (freshman) John Beyer was not here last
ear.”

, Koch has managed to put together a 9- 5 record despite
being new tothe number one slot. Hagood hasalso managed
to fare well against the tough competition, compiling a 10-
4 record. Hagood recently moved up to the third singles po-
sition.

The poor weather recently has ined the team to practice
inside, cutting down on the available court time.

“When we are inside we lose a court, and the result is that
we.can’t play singles as much as we would like. Hopefully,
once the guys have gotten to play a few matches, and we can
practice outside the singles will get better. But, we have
improved our doubles considerably,” said Frank.

This improvement was reflected during a 5-4 loss to Old

Dominion on Tuesday. Last year the team lost all three
doubles matches, but this year the Wildcats managed towin

two matches in doubles. The second doubles team of —

Hagood and senior Blake O’Brien came back from two
match points to win. Unfortunately, the third doubles team

-of Zabell and junior Elijah Gowin lost the deciding match.

Davidson, however, did pull out a victory in another 5-4
match Saturday against Penn State. Hagood and.O’Brien
teamed up to win 7-6, 6-0 after suffering two breaks in the
first set.

Wednesday, the Cats suffered a (5-1) isis to Virginia.

Koch scored the only victory for Davidson, defeating Carl —

Clark 6-4, 7-6. Frank was also pleased with the play of
O’Brien and Zabell,
Frank is optimistic for the rest of the week. Due to a

: scheduling mishap the Davidson will play two matches on

Saturday. First, the Wildcats will go up against defending
Division III National Champions Washington and Lee. A
second match against Pitt will allow some new faces to see
action.

“Some of our sideion players will be tired after the first

match, so I hope to get some new guys like (freshman) Joey
Manibo into the Pitt match,” said Frank.
