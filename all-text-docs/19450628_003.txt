This is the time of year most sport writers dream
about. Sports haven't really gotten into full swing and so
each writer can beat the bridge about what his team’ll
do to the opposition. That just about leaves me out. In
the first place, I’m no sports writer. Then, too, I don’t
dream about anytime of the year except Christmas and
September when I'll be eighteen. But Mel insisted that

One break for sports fans didn’t break last week
when Lin O’Briant, of Durham, who played a good bit of
basketball tor the Wildcats last winter, had a little run-in
with the draft board in Durham. It seems that his uncle
has been kicked off of it and Lyn is 1-A. He was a fine
boy and a good ball player and one who really knows his
sports. One might “bull” with him all night and Lyn would
never repeat*himself. Personally I had looked forward to
a long sports bull session, and was genuinely disappointed
when he could not make it. I’m sure I wasn’t the only one.

Charlie Blackburn, who was also a fine player for us,
is army-bound and expects call anytime. Jack Itheridge
is in Midshipman school at Pass Christian, Miss. Jim
Lowry spent last semester at Union Seminary and has a
church in Rocky Mount for the summer, | understand.
Gabby Bryant is at Great Lakes, so they tell me. Thus is
the tale. of our basketball team. Al Scarborough, Bill
Simpson, and John Wall are the only ones still around.

Inter-mural: softball begins. this week. It should
have hit. full stride by the time the paper is out. There
are six active teams: the Independents and Betas fielding
two each; the Pi Kapps and Pikas fielding one together ;
and the Sigma, KAs, SAEs, and SPEs fielding one. I'll
not make a prediction this week, because all of you know
who I would: pick and I’d probably be wrong, and every-
one would be on my neck and I’d have to be thinking up
excuses and so would the team I picked.

P. T. must also get its due recognition. Three days a
week we have it and if everyone really puts out like some
choice few have been doing, we'll really have a football
team next fall. In case someone is interested or does
not know, P. T. is held every Tuesday, Wednesday, and
Thursday behind the eastern stands of Richardson Field.
The student body is turning out practically 100 per cent to
reap the benefits of such a chance. And it really seems to
be doing some men good such as Nisbet and Stukes to
mention two.

The Davidson Legion team does not seem to be faring
so well against its opposition to date.- But good ball is
being played and it is a spectacle none of us should miss,
for we see so little of it on the Hill. There is.a good bit
of talent on the team and we, the student body of David-
son, should do our part to turn it into a winning outfit.
Let’s turn out as one to these games and give them some
real Davidson backing.
