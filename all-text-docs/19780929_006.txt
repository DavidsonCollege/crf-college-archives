'Cheerleaders score

may consider her optimism
reasonably biased. However,
she was the cheerleading cap-
tain at NC State for two years,
and her experience qualifies her
promising outlook.

Ten of the squad’s fourteen
members are newcomers with-
out college cheerleading exper-
ience. Captain Doug Crosby
thought the squad should at-
tend a nationally recognized
cheerleading camp over the
summer. Crosby ran into bud-
geting problems because the
group’s budget from the athle-
tic department is only $1000,
not enough to purchase uni-
forms.

Camp was therefore neces-
sary but financially impossible,
at a total.cost of $930. Crosby
set out last spring to cut red
tape in acquiring additional
funds.

Academic Vice President
Price'Zimmermann met with
Crosby to discuss alterations in
the athletic budget to serve the
squad’s interest. Zimmermann
did not agree with Crosby's

request for more money.
As has been the case in

similar aspects of athletic bud-
geting, Wildcat Club Director
Sandy Carnegie came to the
cheerleaders’ rescue.
