Vantave of opportunities to ride the referees
and the qnembers of. the oggposing teams.

This is very peor sportsmanship on the part

of fhe student body. Hf the team, although
evidently displeased with a decision ean go
uhead and play the game, win or lose, it

seems that we could cooperate with them and

make the opposing team remember us not
only as the ‘serappiest’? team which they
have played, but also as the most sports-
manlike, players and observers alike.

Notwithstanding all this, T think the stu-
dent body deserves a word of praise for the

spirit that has been shown this year in all

Hall Prayer Meetings .

Little las beew said so far this vear about
our hall meetings, THis is one of the dis-
tinetive features of our college program.
The success of these hall meetings depends
directly upon the stipport of the students.
Bach week certain members of the student
body go te the trouble to prepare a thought
for the evening. We, as fellow studeits, can
well afford to take a few minutes aside
from our studies and join the other members

on the hall ina few minutes of worship,

The hall meetings serve two important pur-

poses. First, they take us aside’ from the
hiisy tite we lead-and give us the opportunity
for quiet meditation. They provide thoughts
that ave stimulating and urge us onward to
the best that is: in These quiet moments
of worship provide, along with our other
services, the stabilizing agent in our. lives,

Second, these meetings help us to get to
know the other-stidents on our hall better,
