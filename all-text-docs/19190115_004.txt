Pyengyang. Korea. Nov. 12, 1918,

Would voit like to have a. “stand-in”
with the professor? ‘Then study the fol-
lowing. commandments:

t.. Register late. This enables the
class to review the work covered before

you arrived.

2. Be absent from class frequenth
and avoid making an explanation. ‘This
keeps the professor thinking.

3. Be tardy when possible. This
furnishes something for those to look at
who are nat interested in the subject un-
der discussion.

4. Misunderstand the assignments.
This enables vou to entertain the profes-
sor with explanatians.

5. Be unprepared often. This enables
the professor to entertain himself -by do-
ing the reciting.

6. Yawn. The professor enjoys
looking at the opening with a rim of face
around it.

7. When vou can't yawn, look at
your watch, This makes it evident that
time hangs heavily on vour hands.

8. When you can no longer look your
watch in the face, look bored. This in-
spires the professors greatly.

9. Avoid handing in parallel on time.
This enables the professor to occupy his
spare time with more golf and less work.

10. Should you happen to be given
less than 90 for an average standing. ap-
pear surprised and wonder why. This
helps the professor remember you.
