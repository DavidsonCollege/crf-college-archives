Davidson women’s basketball
coach. John Filar urges patience
from Davidson fans with this year’s
team as it works to re-establish
women’s basketball at Davidson.
The program was given new life
last year after a five year absence at
Davidson.

One only needs to look at this
year’s roster to distinguish the
youth of the program: nine fresh-
men, two sophomores, one junior
and two seniors. “At times we may
have five freshmen on the floor . .
. and that could be scary,” Filar
admits. “But people need to be
patient with this team. They will
only get better as the season
progresses.”

Watching the Wildcats this
year could be much like watching
a tennis match. Filar looks for his
team to push the ball up the floor at
every opportunity. “We’re going
to run [the fast break] as much as
possible. If we try to get into a half
court game I think we will be over-
matched physically and they will

just be able to pound us [inside],”
Filar says.

Luckily, this year’s team fits
the run-and-gun mold. The team
consists of two natural centers, five
forwards, and six guards. Due to
their lack of size, the ‘Cats will
look to “harass teams” with full-
court pressure, push the ball up
quickly, and shoot the three-
pointer. Filar admits he’s never
been a lover of the “three-point
offense” but says that he is begin-
ning tolike itmoreand more. There
are four or five players on this
year’s team who can shoot effec-

tively from behind the three-point _

line, Filar says. Team speed is great,
Filar says, and he notes that even
his inside players run the court
very well. Though she is 6’ 1”, cen-
ter Kristen Ferrucci is one of the
fastest players on the team.

There aren’t many places on
such a young team to look for lead-
ership, but Filar looks for seniors
Jennifer Roos and Jennie Plowright
to supply “the stability and senior
leadership that will be greatly

needed.” Freshmen center Ferrucci
(6’1”), guard/forward Erin Butcher
(6’0"), center Molly Burke (6’2”)
and guard Tonya Sharpe (5’7”)
should make heavy contributions
early. Sophomore Kristin Solsrud
should see lots of playing time; and
the other players are looked to for
heavy contributions.

There probably won’t be a su-
perstar on the team. As Filar states,
“People won’t notice any one
player. They will likely see many
different people coming’ through
for us.” Other players who figure
to contribute include Katrina
O’Neal, LisaLyons, Addria Capps,
Cara Crosswhite, Kristina Ford,
Cynthia Minko and Margaret
Young.

The Wildcats have elevated
their status from aclub team a year
ago to a “sprouting” Division |
program this year. While last year’s
schedule consisted of NAIA, Divi-
sion III, and club teams, this year’s
schedule includes twelve games

Volleyball Ends Season With

Tournament Loss to Western

By Janet Delery

The Davidson volleyball team
concluded its season Friday after-
noon witha6-15, 7-15, 8-15 loss to
Western Carolina in the Southern
Conference Tournamentat Furman
University. The sixth-seeded Wild-
cats played a strong match against
the third-seeded Catamounts but
were unable to stop their powerful
outside hitters.

After leading the Southern
Conference inserviceaces through-
out the season, the Wildcats once
again used strong serving to dis-
rupt the Catamount’s passing. Sev-
eral players contributed service
aces, with Amy Howard leading
the team with two.

Lorie Logan directed the Wild-
cat offense with 28 assists. On the
receiving end of her sets were hit-
ters Janet Delery (ten kills),
Katherine Anderson (nine kills),
Catherine Milligan (six kills),
Jennie Wagner (four kills), and
Amy Howard (three kills).

Western Carolina proved very
successful throughout the match at

- hitting through the Davidson block.

As a result, the backcourt defense
produced a limited number of digs.
Katherine Anderson led the Wild-
cats in that category with 10.
Earlier in the week, Davidson
played its best match of the season
against UNCC. Seniors Delery,
Milligan and Wagner were hon-
ored before the match. Although
the Wildcats lost the match. in a
tough five-game battle 11-15, 15-
11, 6-15, 16-14, 12-15; the Wild-
cats felt that the match would give
them momentum heading into the
tournament. Coach Carolyn Blake

‘said, “Although we didn’t win, the

match showed that we have made
lots of progress since the last time
we played them. The team really
pulled together and played as well
as we have all season.” cos
Against UNCC, the Wildcat
offense ‘was paced by Lorie
Logan’s 50 assists, Katherine

Anderson’s 21 kills and Janet
Delery’s 14 kills. In addition, the
team played a fantastic defensive
match in recording 78 digs.
Catherine Milligan led the team
with 17 digs, while Anderson,
Delery, and Logan all added 14.

In recognition of the tenth an-
niversary of women’s athletics in
the Southern Conference, each
school selected a Volleyball Team
of the Decade. Davidson’s team
was announced at a reception at
the conference tournament and in-
cluded Maria Douglas, Mimi
Plauche, Holt Hathaway, Delery,
Wagner, and Howard.

In addition, at the Southern
Conference volleyball banquet
held Saturday moming, Davidson’s
Michele Augustin was named the
Southern Conference Freshman
Player of the Year. Although
Augustin missed several matches
during the season due to injury, she

excelled especially in the last three
overtimes, during which Coastal
did not muster a single shot.

The, Wildcats’ best scoring
opportunity of the game came five

minutes into the firstsudden-death _
" said. “The first time, because of a

overtime, when a pass up the left
side of the field from Tommy Suter
found Rob Ukrop at a dead run.
Ukrop took the ball to the left side

of the goal, and had Hickey beaten
to the far post, but missed narrowly
to the right.

The Chanticleers had admin-
istered a rather sound 3-0 defeat to
Davidson October 24 in Conway,
S.C., dominating the game with
their physical play, and Davidson
coach Charlie Slagle felt that the
experience did his team a world of
good. “I think it helped us,” he

combination of fatigue and intimi-
dation, we didn’t play as well as
we could. [Today], we didn’t back

down at all.”

Against N.C. State, the ‘Cats
will meet a team that it played in
the regular season for the third
straight week. Davidson squan-
dered a 3-1 and settled for a 4-4 tie
October 6 in Raleigh. Deegan, who
has had the two finest games of his
life in his last two outings, consid-
ered his performance in that game
“timid” and will be out for re-
demption in therematch. The game
should take place Sunday in Ra-
leigh.
