SUMMER SCHOOL SI2ZLER
ed gentlemen running around: the

campus are loudly proclaiming that this
six week battle with heat and profs has
been "the stupidest thing I've ever done}
But its about over now, and the prospect
of approaching exams has made cveryone
drool for joy,

For those who would study for exams,
the only advice would be that from the
still shaking Yancy Robertson to stay
away from a haunted fraternity row, Since
the dormitories are noisy, and the li-
brary closed or hot, it looks like
nothing is left except to throw in the
towel and take a week's vacation before
the summer vacation,

_ Several methods have been discovere
ed for taking advantage of that week's
vacation, "Man on the Pight Wire"
proved inspiratioml tosome; playing
hide-seek with Houdini to others, Some
just enjoy bull sessions or flashlight
duals with Cop.

The eight hour wonders, though, are
still faithful to. théir jovial dads in
the labs, and from them we haven't heard
a word in years.

With just six reviews and two exams
left to go, we're about thru with the
session anyway. We hope the professors
can be convinced next session that even
though a day is a week, it's just
twenty-four hours long}
