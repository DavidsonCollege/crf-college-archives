Cats defeat Abbey

in dual rugby play

By JOE CRAIG
Staff Writer

The Davidson Rugby Club
managed to overcome a 6-4
halftime deficit and fought to
a 10-6 win over Belmont
Abbey this past Sunday at
Belmont.

Davidson jumped off to a
quick lead as Wilbourne
Swaim broke open for a 20yard
try. Belmont came roaring
back, however, and with a
series of good kicks gained
excellent field position.

- Despite the efforts of Mike
Robinson, Tim Wilkins, and
field Captain Bucky Banks,
Belmont eventually scored. A
successful conversion kick
suddenly made it 6-4.

During the remainder of the
_ first half, Davidson was con-
stantly on the attack and had
ample opportunities to score,
but squandered them away
with penalties, poor passing,
and lackluster hooking in the

scrum.

The second half saw more
inspired play on Davidson's
part. Jeff Morrow won practi-
cally evéry lineout, Wilkins
made a couple of try-stopping
open field tackles, and Chip
Crawford broke loose for some
long runs to set up Swaim’s
second try of the afternoon.

Davidson's scrum asserted
itself well throughout the af-
ternoon, and good pursuit
coupled with gang-tackling

tactics helped stave off a late
Belmont rally.

‘During the second game of
the faternoon, Davidson final-
ly got untracked and won
handily, 24-0.

They managed to score
practically at will, all the while
maintaining a tenacious de-
fense. Crawford and Swaim
scored two tries each, while
Joe Craig and Rusty Holt each
got one.

The Ruggers take on al-
ways-tough Wake Forest in a
home match, this Sunday at
2:00 PM. Spectators are urged
to attend, as they try to up
their record to 3-1.

Soccer team avenges road losses
then drops 2-7 decision to Wake

By CARTER TODD

“Davidson's soccer squad
lost an early 1-0 lead and went
on to lose 2-1 to the Duke Blue
Devils here Wednesday after-
noon. The Cats’ goal came
from scrappy Dave Patton and
the team managed to hold
Duke scoreless until late in the
first period. Davidson then
missed an open shot and
within a minute the Devils had
tied it up on striker Bill
Huntley’s goal. The only scor-
ing in the second half was
another Devil goal, this one

The Cats’ starting goalie,
Bob Perz, did not see action
because of an injured leg and
freshman Doug Schuessler
played in his place. The Blue
Devils goalie also was injured
and left the game with muscle
spasms in his back.

Davidson Coach Chip Stone
felt there was no reason the
Wildcats shouldn’t have won.
He noted that they missed a
total of four shots on an open
goal.

The Wildcats opened their
home schedule against UNC-
Charlotte after five straight
losses on the road. The team
seemed to take out its frustra-
tions on the hapless 49ers, as
freshmen Pete Sluiter and
Scott Wall, Co-Captain Gor-
don Maner, Spanish exchange
student Andrez Perez and

- strikers Dave Patton and Paul
Schliefer all scored for David-
son. The Cats took 48 shots on
goal to just five for UNC-C.
Davidson then confronted a
highly regarded South Caro-
lina squad in a violent, hard-
fought match. Four yellow
cards (warnings) were issued
by the referees, including one
to Coach Chip Stone and
another to Co-Captain Gordon
Maner. Dave Patton was
thrown out of the contest after
an argument over a penalty
called late in the second half.
Although South Carolina
took twice as many shots as
Davidson, a collapsing, loose
defense prevented USC’s
“long-pass-and-shoot’’  stra-
tegy to materialize. Good hus-
tling play by goalies Bob Perz
and Doug Schuessler earled
them their second straight

shutout.

A brilliant sliding save was

made by fullback and Co-Cap-
tain Paul Parker on a shot,
blocked by the charging Schu-
essler but appeared to be
rolling in. In defeating South
Carolina, Davidson handed
them only their second loss,
lowering their record to 9-2.
Dave Patton scored the only
goal.
*yMonday afternoon, back
home at Davidson, the soccer
team took on East Carolina
University. Davidson scored
early during a skirmish in
front of the goal in which
freshman Mark Noel tipped in
a rebound from a Dave Patton
shot blocked by the goalie.
The Wildcats appeared to
dominate the game, though
once again the outstanding
play of Parz, Schuessler, and
Parker prevented many ECU
opportunities.

Davidson appeared to have
the game won when a contro-
versial hands ball penalty was
called on Paul Parker of
Davidson in the penalty area
as an erratic shot struck his
arm from behind. Davidson’s
argument that it was done
unintentionally fell on deaf
ears, and ECU scored the
ensuing penalty kick. The
game ended in a tie after two
overtime periods.

Davidson’s heavy schedule
continues, playing Furman at
Greenville October 15, and
Appalachian State at David-
son October 20. The Wildcats
now stand 2-5-1 on the season.
