.Y¥. M. C. A. MEETING.

On last Thursday night Dr. A. A.
McGeachy, of Charlotte, addressed the
Association. His subject was “The
Double Standard.” Holding the inter-
est of his audience from the very start,
the speaker pointed out very clearly that
as regards the social evil. man and wo-
man were both on the same plane. and
that what was expected of one should be
demanded of the other. This lecture
has been delivered all over the South
with much success, but at no place with
greater appreciation than at Davidson.
The attendance was by far the best in
quite a while.

PROSPECTS FOR VARSITY

(Continued from page 1)
season’s slugging fame, who claims he is
an outfielder and is trying to prove it.
It is likely that Hengeveld’s hitting will
cause him to get a position, if he is not
needed too badly for the twirling staff.
but he will have to hustle to beat Steve,
Bennie and Sam out of their jobs.

The pitching staff promises to be un-
usually strong. Lawson, last — year’s
prem&r twirler, is going in old-time
form, and will probably be the mainstay
of the staff. Besides, there is Henge-
veld, of last year’s Varsity, to call upon
ina pinch. The new faces on the mound
are John Currie, brother of the famous
Murphy Currie, of old-time Davidson
days; Harry Shaw, the clongated south-
paw, and Monty Monteith, of Hunters-
ville. Currie and Shaw seem to have
stuff aplenty, but control is their short
point. However, they are rapidly im-
proving in this respect, and should be
contenders for positions. Monteith has
a world of smoke, and with training
should make a good pitcher.

Last, but not least, Davidson has Bill
Fetzer and DeWitt Kluttz as coaches,
two men who know the business, and
have proven their worth. In them Dav-
idson places her confidence in predicting
a winning team, for, that is the only kine
these two produce.

PAST SEASON IN BASKET

(Continued fram page V)
tionally fast, but he’ quickly disproved
this, bobbing up in all parts of the fray,
always on top of the ball, and continu-
ally breaking up threatening rushes of
the foe. He was a powerful man on
scoring points from a mix-up directly un-

der the goal, and many a basket oozed |

through directed by Dutch’s fingers,
when it seemed hopelessly lost in a jum-
ble of arms and legs.

All these men will be back next year,
and should make a combination that will
make Davidson a powerful opponent of
anything in the State. Only one team,
North Carolina, was successful in wrest-
ing a complete series from the Red and
Black, all other college opponents being
at least tied. Elon, A. & M., Trinity,
split even with Davidson, while Guil-
ford proved double losers to the Presby-
terian five. Statesville dropped three
games to the locals, and Charlotte Y.
M. C. A. split even.

Besides the Varsity, this season has
served to develop some likely looking
scrub material for future Varsities.
Among the men who have been working
faithfully, helping whip the regulars in-
to shape. and battling valiantly night
after night that the Varsity might reach
better efficiency, are Nimocks, Ben
White. Williamson, McAlister, Carson
and Murray. Davidson is going to see
some of these men on the Varsity in fu-
ture days, and from present indications,
thev will he able successors of the pres-
ent Varsity.
