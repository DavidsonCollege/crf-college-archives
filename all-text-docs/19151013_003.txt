An effort is to be made this winter to

quite a sufficient nucleus around which
to work for a bigger. better and stronger
D. C. Alumni Association.

The following D. C. men are at the

during the fierce advance into Russia.
Most of the wounded reached the hos
pital in an infected condition, — the
wounds not having had a dressing for
several days previously. Sixty five. per
cent recovered, however. Bob attend:
ed church with the Kaiser and said that

last year. After the ceremony, Mr. and

MAGAZINE. OUT SOON.

The first issue of the Magazine is
coming out on the 20th of this month.
The Magazine is going to be larger this
year than it has heen heretofore, as it
will be issued only four times during
the year. The staff has been very busy
for some time getting the material in
shape and this first issue promises to be
a good one. F. H. Smith, the editor-
in-chief, made a trip to Atlanta during
the past week to make final arrange-
ments for the issuance of the Magazine.

Special invitation to all.
