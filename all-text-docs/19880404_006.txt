Save your trash: recycling begins Environmental Weeks

By LISA GERRARD

The slogan: “GET WASTED .. . materials out of your
life.” The occasion: a recycling drive that kicks off
Davidson’s first Environmental Weeks. The prime instiga-
tor: Charles Tambiah, Biology Society president, seen on
page one of this issue with fellow collaborator Ryan.

Environmental Weeks, April 3-16, confront issues such
as wildlife conservation and nuclear technology. Tambiah
and other Biology Society members are working with the
College Union to bring distinguished speakers to the
campus.

The organizers have planned a variety of activities that
include several presentations by Davidson students. Their
goals are to increase general environmental awareness on
the campus and to show their peers how they also can plan
projects that protect and enrich the environment.

Students can get involved with Environmental Weeks by
saving their paper, plastic, glass and aluminum products for
an April 11 collection on the Union Patio. Patterson Court
houses are included in the recycling drive; Tambiah said
that his group is enlisting members of each house to
organize individual collections.

Students may also contribute to the Union Gallery exhi-

bition of April 3-16. Those interested should submit pho-

tography, art work and writings concerning an environ-

mental theme to the Union desk through Sunday, April 3.

Davidson students, faculty march for Central American peace

By JAY BARRON

Last Sunday, a group of Davidson stu-
dents and faculty members participated in
the first day of a statewide walk for peace in
Central America. The Pilgrimage for Peace
began in six cities throughout North Caro-
lina, and culminated on Saturday, April 2,
in Raleigh with a large rally to demonstrate
“solidarity” for peace in Central America.

The walk is being organized by a coali-
tion of groups including the North Carolina

Council of Churches, Witness for Peace,
and the Carolina Interfaith Task Force on
Central America, (CITCA).

The Pilgrimage drew an enthusiastic
crowd to the Charlotte starting point at
UNCC. Following a few opening remarks
and a prayer, the walkers moved out onto
the highway led by a bright banner reading
“Create Peace in Central America.”

Although the Davidson participants
walked only the first 14-mile leg of the
route, several Charlotte-area activists will
be joined by other local groups as they con-
tinue to Raleigh.

According to Jake Golden, a Charlotte
minister who has spent time in Nicaragua
and was aboard a boat captured by the
Contras there two years ago, the idea of

walking for peace is based upon the Nicara-
guan “via cruces,” or “way of the crosses,”
an ancient tradition that was revived in
Nicaragua by Father Miguel D’Escoto,
currently the Nicaraguan foreign minister.

The walk demonstrates a desire for peace
during the Easter Season. |

The walkers Sunday carried white
crosses bearing the names of Central
American victims of violence, including an

American nun who was murdered along -

with four other women in El Salvador in
1980, a group of Nicaraguan men killed by
the Contras, and a Swiss citizen martyred in
the Nicaraguan countryside who had
worked with Reverend Golden in protest-
ing the violence.

In a service -held following the walk,
Golden spoke about his friend’s violent
death, and a photo he has of him pounding
a wooden cross similar to those carried on

Sunday into the ground on the site of the

murder of other Nicaraguans.

Davidson professor Sandy Kemp was-

among the walkers on Sunday. She said the
walk was about “standing up and walking
for what you believe in, peace. This is
especially true in Nicaragua, because we
are actively fighting there.”

en asked if people would view the
as justanother anti-Contraprotest, she
said she hoped it would be seen as more
widely-based, because it represents not
only Nicaragua, but all of Central America.
In addition, the timing of the walk, during
the Eater season, highlights the Christian
concern for peace.

Ellen Ott, a freshman, said that her
friends reacted differently when she told
them about her involvement in the Pilgrim-
age. “Some laughed,” she said, “some said
good or asked questions. I haven’t heard
any really derogatory comments, but
maybe I just haven’t talked to the right
people,” she laughed.

Ott said the walk made her feel great,
especially since, as a student at Davidson
she sometimes feels indecisive. “I should
spend more time helping and doing some-
thing other than being a student,” she said.

Another faculty member who took part
was Political Science Professor Brian
Shaw. He pointed out that the walk was not
only on behalf of Nicaragua, but also El
Salvador and Guatemala, and some of the
other “less heralded” nations involved in
the violence.

In reference to El Salvador, Shaw stated

that that country is currently the third larg-
est recipient of United States financial aid,
and the first country since Vietnam in the
70’s to get most of its revenue from the
US., approximately 60%.

“Human rights violations are increasing
in El/Salvador, a country which has be-
come, for all intents and purposes, a North
American Client,” said Shaw. “We are
becoming increasingly involved in a very
nasty war.”

Charles Gowing got involved because a
friend of his is in the 82nd airborne, the
American soldiers sent to Honduras as part
of the U.S. “show of force.”

“As a physics major, I sometimes feel I

know shamefully little about Central
America, but I learned a lot on Sunday.”

Gowing went on to say that even the little
he did know before told him that peace
through force is not the way. “It was an
Opportunity to show that I believe in peace,
and not just in Central America,” he said.

One marcher carried a sign on Sunday
saying “I’m against the Contras!” Gowing
disagreed with this sentiment, saying “we
can’t be againstanybody. We’ ve gotto look
at them as people, just like the Sandinistas,
the Guatemalans, and the Salvadorans.”
