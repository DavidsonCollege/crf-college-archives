By Erik SWANSON
Staff Writer

The women’s and men’s ten-
nis teams mixed in some non-
conference opponents last
week in the middle of the
Southern Conference sched-
ules, experiencing mixed
results against tough competi-
tion. The women took on for-
mer-SoCon member East
Tennessee State University in
Johnson City, TN, on Saturday,
losing a competitive 5-2 match,
while the men traveled into
Charlotte on Saturday and
defeated cross-county rival
UNC-Charlotte by a 5-2 mar-
gin.

The women entered
Saturday’s match with a 12-6
record, but faced a tough chal-
lenge in a talented ETSU team.
The Wildcats started slowly in
the doubles portion of -the
match, dropping all three
matches to fall in an early hole.

“We didn’t start well in the
doubles matches,” said assis-
tant coach Avi Kigel, “so we
had to play catch up for the rest
of the match.”

Davidson then got two wins
in the singles matches, but it
was not enough for the victory.
Kelsey Linville ’08 easily han-
died her opponent at the number one posi-
tion, winning 6-2, 6-3. Kim Whelan ’08 was
responsible for the Wildcats’ only other sin-
gles triumph, overcoming her opponent at
number three in three hard-fought sets, 7-5,
3-6, 6-0.

Recent Southern Conference Player of the
Week honoree Lora Dushanova ’09 had her
nine-match winning streak snapped, as she
fell 7-5, 7-5 at the sixth position.

“The match was much closer than the
score indicates,” said Kigel. “We fought hard
and played well, but ETSU is a very good
team. We have to give them credit.”

The women got a chance to bounce back
and end a two-match losing streak on
Sunday at Appalachian State. After winning
two of the three doubles matches, the ’Cats
were victorious in five of the six singles

matches, rolling to a convincing 6-1 win.
Sunday’s victory elevated the team’s overall
record to 13-7 on the season, and the
Wildcats remain perfect in SoCon competi-
tion at 5-0.

The men’s team traveled to Charlotte on
Saturday for a matchup against a 49er team
that always proves tough.

Having made some recent changes to the
doubles lineup, Davidson hoped to get off to
a good start.

While the ’Cats lost quickly at the first
position, two hard-fought victories at posi-
tions two and three earned the team the dou-
bles point,

Joe Cheaney ’06 and Phillip Compeau ’08
grinded out a 9-7 victory at number two,
while Daniel Bermeo ’06 and Matt Hartman
won 8-6 at number three.

“Winning that doubles
point was huge for us,
. because we knew they
were particularly strong in
singles,” said assistant
coach Scott Briggs.

Needing to win only
three of the six singles
matches, Davidson got off
to a great start with Ethan
Jaffee’s (’09) dominant
performance at position
three, where he rolled to a
6-1, 6-1 victory.

Scott Myers ’09 contin-
ued his strong play as well
at number five, winning 7-
5, 6-0.

Three-set victories by
Bermeo and Hartman at
positions two and six,
respectively, capped off
the Wildcats’ win, as the
team prevailed 5-2.

“Some recent changes to
the singles lineup seem to
be working well for us,”
said Briggs. “The guys
who have moved up in the
lineup are working hard
and playing well.”

The women’s team takes
on Elon, UNC-Greensboro
and Wofford this week,
before concluding the reg-
ular season with a home
match against Furman a
week from Friday.

The men’s team hosts Furman for Senior
Day today, the final home match of head
coach Jeff Frank’s 34-year career, and the
men will close out their regular season with
matches at Appalachian State and Elon this
weekend. ,
