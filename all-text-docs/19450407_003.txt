According to all
reports, the volley-
ball tournament. is
progressing very sa-
tisfactorily. At the
present time, it looks
as if the indepen-
dents will win. The
hot independents
have many advanta-
ges which help them
to turn out a consis-
tenly good team.
With_the height of
Berry, ‘Shaw, and
Alexander, they are
able to put up an ex-
cellent battle at the
net, and Davis and
Myatt are also us-
ually “in there’ to
help round out the team. To date the Independents have
only suffered one defeat at the hands of the Sigmas in
the first game of the series.

The rest: of the teams seem to be fairly evenly match-
ed and it seems to be anybody’s race as far as second place
is concerned., Some of the outstanding players that have
shown up this year are as follows: Berry, O’Briant, Shaw,
Newell, Gordon, Owens, Sinclair and Coble.

Another interesting’ sport feature along inter-frater-
nity lines will be the intermural track meet which is to be
held soon. It will consist of a preliminary meet to be held
in the afternoon, and the finals will be run off at night
under the stadium floodlights. It will be interesting to see
what the fraternities have to offer in the way of track
material.

It looks as if we are going to have a varsity baseball
team this year. Games have been arranged with small
colleges such as Wofford and Hamden Sidney, Let's all
get behind the team, and show them a little support. They
will be doing their best, and if we show them that we want
them to win, it might help them bring home the bacon.

Speaking of baseball, there have been quite a few
funny, baseball stories which have ‘been handed down
through the years, including the one about the cross-eyed
left handed pitcher who had two strikes on the batter, look-
ed at the batter and threw to first base, catching thé man
off first.

The batter swung and the umpire called them both
out, but there is one in which Davidson should have
particular interest. It happened to Mr. Hengeveld
back in the days when he was pitching for Little Rock
in the Southern League. It seems that back in those days
clubs were limited to a very small number of players and
Mr. Hengeveld was put in right ffeld in. the’ absence of
the regular right fielder. In a game at New Orleans it was
getting dark and the wind which was coming in from the
Gulf blew’a sea gull across the path of a ball being hit
to right field. Mr. Hengeveld chased the ball all the way to
the fence only to see it over the fence flapping its wings
merrily while the ball stopped many yards back. The
converstation which followed between Mr. Hengeveld
and the manager is scarcely printable! Maybe that’s
why he isn’t playing any longer.

the Chaplain narrated thegfollowing
impressions :
“Christmas Eve the Group CP was

supper the Colonel suggested that
we call time-out and have a service
right there. Maps pushedy
back, pencils laid aside, and type-
writers halted faw

Whittier, Herion Pitching;
Practice Game Played

After about three weeks of prac-

‘tice the baseball team is beginning

to look like something. The pitch-
ing staff is rather weak, with sev-
eral candidates but not much exper-
ience. Phil Whittier and Herion will
probably do most of the work,
though Pete Sinclair has done some

pretty good pitching,

Coach Shepard stated that nore
of the positions are sewed up’ yet,
but the tentative starting line-up
will probably include the following :
Herion or Whittier at first, Brooks
at second, Thatcher at short stop,
and Sherrill at third. In the
field

Keesler, Several other men are‘close

out-

will be Cobffe, Lasley, and

behind in the race for positions.

Though the hitting does not’ look
too strong, in a p¥actice game last
week the two teams cach got five
runs, Herion pitched for’ one team
and Coach Shepard and Dr. Currie,
a preacher and ex-ballplayer at Da-
vidson, did the hurling for the other
side.

Thy first game of the season has
been scheduled with Wofford |Col-
