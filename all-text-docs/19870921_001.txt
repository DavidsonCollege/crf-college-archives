Students protest

WDAV cancels Flipsides * ~-

By SUSAN PEARSALL

At a meeting on Thursday,
September 10, Vice-President for
Institutional Advancement John
Griffith announced the cancella-
tion of the WDAV alternative pro-
gram “Flipsides.”

The program, which admit-
tedly did not fit into the station’s
classical format, was the last ves-
tige of the formerly student-oper-
ated, student-programmed, ten-
watt station which the Trustees
took over in December of 1978
and subsequently upgraded into a
professional outfit with a classical
music format. It was also at that
time that “Flipsides” came into
existence. As a concession to the
angry students who resented the
loss of “their” station the Trustees
and the staff of WDAV agreed to
air “Flipsides” in the 11:00 p.m.’

onan Davidson College, Davidson, North Carolina 28036

1:00 a.m. time slot every week-
night and to give the program en-
tirely over to student operation.
However, in the fall of 1985, a
committee of the Advisory Board
of WDAV decided to review the
“Flipsides” program and its place
in the new classical format. The
reviewing process, designed by
the head of the “Flipsides” prog-
ramming staff as well as a few stu-
dents and members of the profes-
sional staff, began in February of
1987 and was conducted by the
Advisory Committee. According
to station manager John Clark, the
committee made every effort to
insure an “open, accessible” re-
view process. As a result of the re-
view, a sizable portion of the ad-
visory board decided that the “al-
ternative” music aired on “Flip-
sides” represented a valid cultural

art form and deserved expression.
They recommended to the profes-
sional staff that the program con-
tinue because of the student par-
ticipation it afforded at WDAV.

However, Clark said, in late
April the staff began considering
the board’s conclusion and deter-
mined that “while “Flipsides”
music is.a valid art form. . . it is
so radically different from the rest
of our format that we decided to
recommend to the staff that it be
discontinued.

Clark, defending the staff’s
findings, stated, “Our perspective
is, we’re looking at a radio service
whose primary interest is serving
the classical format, and at
whether or not “Flipsides” fits into
that format.”

Emanon sells Kappa Sigma’s kitchen

Money funded beach trip

By WALT REYNOLDS and
FRANK FOLGER

When members of the Kappa
Sigma fraternity colony returned
to school this September, they dis-
covered that the kitchen facilities
in their newly-assigned Patterson
Court house had been partially re-

moved.

According to Kappa Sigma
President Conrad Doenges, Dean
of Students Will Terry and a mem-

ber of Kappa Sigma inspected the |

old Emanon house at the begin-
ning of last summer and deter-
mined that the existing kitchen

would be operable for the col-
ony’s opening in the fall.

In fact, Doenges stated, the
house’s kitchen was one reason
why the old Emanon house was
selected for the Kappa Sigma lo-
cation. ;

“They [the school] thought

that by giving us Emanon, the cost
would be reduced. ..because ithad
a working kitchen.” However,
upon arrival at their newly-as-
signed house this fall, members
found that many of the previously
accounted-for kitchen supplies in-
cluding plates, silverware, cups,
pots and pans were missing. Dean
Terry was informed that the Ema-
non members had, without per-
mission, sold much of the kitchen
equipment.

Michael Stephens, Treasurer

of Emanon, said he was in charge:

of an auction held last spring,
open only to. past and present
Emanon members. At the auction
many house furnishings, includ-

"ing kitchen ware, were sold to in-

dividuals. Stephens claimed that
the auctioned property was right-
fully owned by the house accord-
ing to the Davidson College Pat-
terson Court House Operations
Guidelines. The guidelines, pro-
vided by the Business Office, de-
fine the responsibilities of both the
college and the tenant organiza-
tions in maintaining and operating
each house on Patterson Court..
According to these guidelines,
which are under revision this year,

imposes new

parking fee

But where will money go?

By PETER MANGONE

When returning Davidson stu-
dents registered their cars this
year, many were shocked to dis-
cover that the college now re-
quires a $30 registration fee for all
students who wish to keep a car on
campus. Any student who refuses .
to comply and parks in campus
lots will have his car towed at his
own expense.

The decision to charge a regis-
tration fee results from a revision
of the campus parking policy
begun last year under the supervi-
sion of Public Safety Director Jac-
kie Hughes and Vice-President of
Business and Finance Robert Sut-

“ton.

According to Sutton there
were three main factors which
contributed to the decision to

-charge a parking fee. ‘First, there—

was a “growing sense of the need
to deal with the parking situa-
tion.” According to Hughes some
Davidson students were simply
not registering their vehicles with

the campus security last year. He
