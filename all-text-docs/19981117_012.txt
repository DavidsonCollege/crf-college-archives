In Focus With: Frank Santore ‘81, ‘“The Voice of the ‘Cats”’

On Saturday, Nov. 7, Davidsonian
Sports Staff member, Stephen Cefalu
sat down and spoke with legendary
Davidson Wildcats radio sportscaster
Frank Santore. Santore is entering his
fourth season as the “Voice of the
‘Cats.” Catch his play-by-play cover-
age of Wildcat basketball on 105.3
WAGI-FM (Gaffney, S.C.) each and
every game day on campus.

DSS: What originally brought you to
Davidson?

SANTORE: I came to Davidson in
1977 to play football, but found out my
freshman year that they didn’t need any
5° 9,”’ slow offensive linemen. It really
devestated me. It was sort of an identity
crisis for me after I quit playing. It was
the only thing I ever quit.

DSS: How did you do academically
while you were at Davidson?

SANTORE: I really thought I was
gonna come here and set the world on
fire, but it was tough. I found a lot of
torture in my studies. I graduated with
a 2.7 average. So, for those who are
having a difficult time at Davidson, and
battling it, I say, “There’s life after
college. There’s life after Davidson.”
I’m always saying, “Get rid of your
books, come out and watch a basketball
game,” because you will find when
you're age 39 or 40 that you wish you
could’ ve done half the stuff you had an
opportunity to do when you were age 19
or 20.

DSS: In general, how would you char-
acterize the student body at
Davidson?

SANTORE: Without intending to of-
fend anyone, there’s something I just
don’t understand about Davidson.
Eveybody is so uptight around here. It
was the case when I was in school, and
it’s the case right now. Everybody
walks around with their nose in a book.
College is so much more than having
your nose stuck in a damn book 24 and
7. Why can’t students take 2 or 3 hours
out on a Monday night (to watch the
‘Cats in Belk Arena)? It’s not gonna
kill them. What’s wrong with people
here? It’s utterly ridiculous. People
gotta realize what a great thing they
have here. We need everybody. | I
would love to see the day when we’re
averaging 4000-4,500 fans a game.

DSS: How did you first get into broad-
casting?

SANTORE: Two years out of law
school in 1987, I was sitting at home
with my Dad having lunch, and watch-
ing TV, and there was a talk show on
with a guy who ran the: Sportscasters
Camps of America. I always had this
yen to be a sportscaster, to be a radio
play-by-play guy. I called the guy up.
They were holding a session in Atlanta.
(So, I went.)

DSS: Who has most influenced you as
a broadcaster?

SANTORE:
Larry Munson.
When I went
down to At-
lanta (to the
Sportscasters
Camp), lo and
behold, there he
was, my idol,
Larry Munson,
the voice of the
Georgia Bull-
dogs. He’s got a deep, gravelly voice.
What this guy did for twenty-some-odd
years is what I do now. He’d do a high
school football game in Tennessee on a
Friday night, drive wherever he had to
get fora SEC game on Saturday, pull in
some place, get 4 hours sleep, have a
cup of coffee, go over his notes, go to
the stadium, do the game, beat the traf-
fic out and try to get back by midnight
so that he could go out and shoot hunt-
ing or fishing films until midnight on
Sunday. I pattern myself after Larry
Munson, my idol.

A

DSS: What’s most alluring to you
about the radio broadcasting profes-
sion?

SANTORE: In radio, you are the
_people’s eyes andears. TV is too simple.
Anyone can do that. It’s tougher when
you have to sit there and-paint the pic-
ture for the radio audience. It’s an
absolute craft. People turn down the
sound on ESPN and turn you up, not
necessarily because you’re great, but
because they identify your voice with
the team they follow.

DSS: Would you say you get an
emotional high from considering how
far your voice travels?

SANTORE: After doing the game, I
feel like I’ ve had some really good sex.

(You can print that).

famous calls?

SANTORE: “Slam, bam, thank you,
ma’am,” after Brandon Williams (‘96)
stuffed home the ball in the closing
seconds of overtime to cement a critical
game against Furman in 1996. After-
wards, a female faculty member went to
the Athletic Director and said the phrase
disparaged women, but I wasn’t think-
ing about any of that. At least someone
from the faculty was listening to the
broadcast;

; “Glory,
halleujah! You
can paint in red
and black,” after
Ali Ton stole the
ball to seal a huge
victory over Ole
Miss in 1996.
Since then, it’s
become my signa-
ture call for every
Davidson win;

“Cinderella, put on your glass slippers.
We’ re going to the ball,” when we won
the Southern Conference final last year.

All this stuff happens spontane-
ously. I don’t sit back and think, “Well,
what types of ‘ad-libs’ can I come up
with to impress people.

DSS: What can you say about the
growth of your listening audience
since you’ve been on the air?

SANTORE: We've expanded this ra-
dio network like you wouldn’t believe.
Five years ago, nobody could pick up
Davidson basketball. Now you can
pick it up on 20 stations in 6 states.
When you’ re driving from point to point
in acar, you almost never have to worry
about losing the Davidson basketball
game on the radio. We’re continually
trying to blow our coverage further and
further out into the night, and unite our
fan base. We are a light hidden under a

basket, and I’ve been trying to take that
light out from underneath the basket for
four years now.

DSS: How would you describe your
relationship with Davidson College’s
athletic department?

SANTORE: Neither Jim Murphy
(Davidson College Athletic Director),
nor Bob McKillop (Wildcat men’s bas-
ketball head coach), nor Tim Landis
(Wildcat football head coach), nor any
other coach or anybody in the athletic
department has ever come to me and
said, “We want to dictate how you do
your play-by-play.” I’ve been given a
tremendous amount of freedom to do
my job how I like.

The athletic department here
doesn’t get nearly the respect it de-
serves. I give Terry Holland (former
Davidson College Athletic Director) his
due, but Jim Murphy has done more for
Davidson in two and a half years than
Terry Holland could’ ve ever thought of
doing in five. The Board of Trustees
has to be more appreciative of the ath-
letic department. I know there’s only so
much they can do, but it’s the little
things that matter. They have to do
whatever they can, within reason, to
make sure people in the athletic depart-

mentare happy. They shouldn’t squeeze —

pennies. They shouldn’t close their
hearts. It’s vitally important that we
have an athletic department that suc-
ceeds, because that’s the way we get
this school known in 50 states, and not
just the South Atlantic region.

DSS: What’s your prognosis for the
1998-99 Wildcat men’s basketball
team?

SANTORE: We’re gonna have to get
a step-up guy like Mark Donnelly was.
It’s gonna be Ben Ebong, Ben “the Big
Dog” Ebong. The man has enormous
pride in himself. He’s a guy that’s not

satisfied with his glass three-quarters
full, Ben Ebong is gonna-have a big
season, and I’m not just talking about
points; I’m talking about leadership. I
have no doubt that he’ Il step it up. And
the rest of the guys? I think they’ll
follow.

DSS: What can you say about Bob
McKillop?

SANTORE: Other than my father, I
respect Bob McKillop more than any
other man that I’ve ever met. He is a
morally upright man. He is honest and
straightforward. I want to live in a
world full of Bob McKillops, full of

morally upright people.
