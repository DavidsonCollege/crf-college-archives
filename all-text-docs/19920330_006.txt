“The deepest depths of Hell are reserved for those who
remain neutral in times of crisis.”
-John F. Kennedy

Just what is going on around here? Or should we say, “What
isn’t going on around here?” The school’s administration is
preparing to implement a radically different alcohol policy and
when the SGA organizes a student forum to discuss the issue, a
meager 30 of us show up. Surely more than 30 of us have a vested
interest in this proposed policy. When the “Select Committee” re-
leased its report two weeks ago the only signs of protest or
discussion from the student body were only from those directly
affected, despite the fact that the report tackled all aspects of
Davidson life and community. Does this lack of response from

the student body mean that we are pleased with the actions of’

various groups and individuals affecting our lives? Surely not.
Last week when The Davidsonian published the list of candidates
running for SGA offices, the editorial board found it sadly ironic
that there were only 5 rising Seniors and 7 rising Juniors contest-
ing the positions. On a brighter note, 15 rising Sophomores ran.
But why does apathy seem to grow with the years spent at
Davidson? Our editorial last week was a rather strong denuncia-
tion of the select committee’s work and we fully expected to be
able to print rebuttals in this week’s paper. We received one let-
ter concerning the editorial. We heard from .06% of you.

If you are pleased with the direction the school has taken over
the past few weeks then your reaction is appropriate. But if you
are not, then it is your responsibility to make your voice heard.
The Dean- of Students office welcomes student input on the
various aspects of our lives. Sadly, there has been little to no
response from students on the proposed alcohol policy, leaving
the office to formulate the policy with little student input. So,

when this new eh enacted and you are not pleased with it, -

do not blame the Dean of Students or the SGA, it is your fault.

. This is your school. You and your families are investing a great
deal of money into your education. Get something out of this
investment and get involved. The choice is yours and opportuni-
ties for your input are plenty. Don’t let the opportunity pass you
by.

Student Finds True Source of
Campus Troubles and Tensions

To the editor,

Asa former journalist, I
feel that it is my obligation
to the Davidson community
to make use of my investiga-
tive skills to address a prob-
lem that plagued this cam-
pus for quite some time-- the
ongoing SAEsaga. With six
SAE pledges, or rather for-
mer pledges, on my hall and
an SAEhall counselor, Ihave
been able to witness this
growing cancer from a bet-
ter perspective than most.

I have watched them
when they did not know I
was around. I have listened

to their conversations. Ihave
spied on the types of people
they fraternize with. My
findings are startling, but the
most shocking discovery of
all occurred late one night
this past winter. One of the
pledges (who shall remain
nameless), passed out in my
room after a drunken ram-
page of vandalism and ver-
bal abuse. As I approached
the sleeping dragon, I no-

ticed something behind his.
right ear. Upon further in-
-vestigation, I found the

number“666” to beengraved
in the back of his head.

Still unconvinced that
my discovery was what I
feared, I began to frequent
their parties, much to my
discomfortand terror. Isoon
found that aside from their
penchant for brandishing
baseball bats in a threaten-
ing manner, I was going to
have to look elsewhere for
evidence. The crafty boys
hid their swastikas and other
Nazi paraphernalia from my
wandering eyes.

Oblivious to the tremen-
dous danger, I decided to

Community Rebuilding
Requires Honor and Compassion

To the Editor:

The Honor Code and

Code of Responsibility
demand respect and integ-
rity on the part of the entire
Davidson community.
Members of an honorable
and compassionate commu-
nity must act when intoler-
ance and dishonesty arise.
The Select Committee
forced us to examine some
of the fundamental tenets of
the Davidson social life. If
we fail to learn and change
from the incidents of this
school year, Davidson may
be in danger of losing the
honor and respect that hope-

fully definesourcommunity.

The Davidsonian editors
chose to criticize Chuck
Hasty for not maintaining a
neutral stance as a chaplain
instead of rebuking the indi-
viduals who haye yet to
reveal information relating
to unresolved incidents of
harassment. Members of
SAE chose to write a divi-
sive advertisement that can
only weaken the community
arid hurt those students af-
fected by unresolved cases
of intolerance. . Defensive
posturing is natural when
attacked, but it seems to me
that bitter criticism of the

Select Committee’s allega-
tions is improper ifeven one
harassment case is unre-
solved. Ifany SAE’s or other
Davidson students have
knowledge of the three
remaining incidents that the
fraternity’s advertisement
describes as unsolved, this
information must be given
to the proper individuals.
Otherwise, how can we call
ourselves acommunity char-
acterized by integrity, friend-
ship and fraternity?

The Select Committee
may have made allegations

Apathy Frustrates

Turner

To the Davidson
College Campus,

Does anyone at this col-
lege giveadamn? Different
groups oncampus have been
working on the proposed
alcohol policy, trying to get
andput forth students’ ideas.
I guess they are the only
people who care about the
alcohol policy. Or maybe
you think that groups in
charge of changes can read
your minds so you do not
need to.tell anyone, The
SGA cannot have a strong
influence on this proposed
policy unless they have stu-
dent backing.

' The SGA has had many

forums in order to gather

student concerns. I am sick

of hearing people complain
that the SGA never accom-
plishes anything. Tonight
there were only thirty stu-
dents at the alcohol policy
forum. When thereport from
the Select Committee pre-
sented its findings we criti-
cized it because they did not
interview enough students
and therefore their conclu-
sions were unrepresentative
of the student body. If stu-

dents want to be represented ©

they should be involved in

~ the Select Committee’s proj-

ect however, everyone was
welcome at the forum.

The SGA worked hard
and gave Dean Terry a thor-
ough response to his pro-
posal. Dean Terry has come
out with a second edition of
the proposed alcohol policy,
which encompasses many of
the SGA’s recommenda-
tions. In addition, when
forums are poorly attended,
those who have put long
hoursinto making proposals
are very discouraged and’
believe that their work was _
for naught,

If students wantchanges,

they need to illustrate how
