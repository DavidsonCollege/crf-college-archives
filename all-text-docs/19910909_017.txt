Wildcats Struggle in Football
Loss to Guilford College

By Bruce Balestier

In a game they played them-
selves out of with turnovers, pen-
alties and missed tackles, Davidson
began its 1991 season Saturday
with a convincing 21-3 defeat at
the hands of Guilford College. The
Wildcats actually moved the foot-
ball effectively between their 20-
yard line and the Quakers’ 25-yard
line, but had several drives stall in
Guilford territory, turned the ball
over five times, and managed just
a 31-yard field goal by Drew Fas-
sett.

Of course, matters were made
more difficult by the first quarter
injury of starting quarterback Rich-
ard Howell. Howell ran the option
smoothly (3 rushes for 36 yards)
before being, knocked out of the
game with bruised ribs. The ‘Cats
opening possession, led by How-
ell, was a model for several others
during the course of the game. A
13-yard run by Howell and an 11-
yard pass play from Howell to Dan
Lamar (6 receptions for 98 yards)
set up a Davidson first down at the
Guilford 20-yard line. But the drive
gound to a halt with a pair of in-
complete passes, and the Wildcats
came away with nothing when
Fassett missed a42-yard field goal.

The Quakers got.all the scor-
ing they would need late in the first
quarter, when wide receiver Chip

Hester broke free of two Wildcat
tacklers to score on a 54-yard pass
from quarterback Chip Hester.
With Howell’s. injury began
the baptism by fire of freshman
backup quarterback Kevin
Holzworth. Holzworth completed
8 of 20 passes for 131 yards and

Richard Howell sustained rib in-

jury in game against Guilford

was sacked 5 times and intercepted
once, but suffered mainly from in-
experience. Afterward, Holzworth.
said: “It’s football,” he said. “I got
initiated.” Perhaps the highlight

for him was 28-yard pass play to
Bruce Bannister in the second
quarter that placed the Wildcats at
the Guilford 21-yard line. Unfor-
tunately, a fumble by Bannister on
the following play drew the drive
to an abrupt close.

Davidson notched their only
points on their last drive of the
first half. A 19-yard pass from
Holzworth to Lamar set up a
first down at the Quaker 11-
yard line. After an incomplete
pass and asack, the ‘Cats settled
for a 31-yard field goal from
Fassett. Fassett was also a de-
fensive hero, limiting Guilford
field position with 6 punts for a
42-yard average.

The Quakers put the game on
ice during the fourth quarter
with a pair of sustained touch-
down drives in which they ran

_ the ball up the middle of the
Davidson defense virtually at
will.

The sloppy loss left Davidson
head coach Dave Fagg some-
what shaken. “We need to go
back to work - maybe to the

' drawing board offensively,” he
said. “When our offense doesn’t
score a touchdown, that runs up a
red flag.” Davidson returns to ac-

Alumni Invitational Kicks
Off Cross Country Season

By Richard Wharton

Hot lead and cool breezes was
the theme for this year’s Davidson
Open/Alumni Invitational race this
Saturday, as several of Davidson’s
finest runners and alumni showed
up for the annual meet.
This year’ srace was quite
possibly the largest yet;
thirty-nine men and fif-
teen women competed
against the clock andeach
other.

When the men’s 8k
race went off at nine
o*clock, Davidson’s
number one man, Chris
Otrok, took off at the start-
ing line and never looked
back, finishing in first
place with anew personal
record of 27:52. Right be-
hind him, running unat-
tached this season, was
junior David Kerns, run-.
ning at 28:02. Kerns, who
will be attending St. An-
drews College this year,
is already looking forward
tonext year’s race and his
return to the team. Finish-
ing in succession after
Kerns were current
Davidsonrunners Ian Ste-
wart, Cam Dauler, and ©

the upcoming meets at Clemson
and elsewhere in the Carolinas.
Next across the line was returning
alumnus John Moss (91), finish-
ing at 28:58, his fastest time ever
onthe Davidson course. Rounding

" Chris Otrok, '92.

Wharton, and Kevin Wilson, with
Alumnus Barry Bishop (68) run-
ning a 30:19.

Inthe women’s race, Davidson
runners took places two through
eight, showing strong promise for
the challenges they
will have encounter
this fall. Susan
Davidson Rollins,
alumnus (’80), took
the overall lead with a
very strong 19:54,

Point to Open Season

By Bruce Balestier
The Davidson volleyball team

somewhat leisurely fashion Wed-
nesday night, outclassing an infe-
rior High Point team by a 15-3, 15-
6, 16-14 count.

The Wildcats made their in-
tentions clear from the start, taking
10 consecutive points to run out to
a 13-1 lead in the first game. The
second game had a similar sto-
ryline; after spotting High Point a
6-3 lead, the ‘Cats scored 12
straight points to close out the
game. In the final game, the
Davidson reserves suffered from
spurts of lackadaisical play, and
actually fought off a pair of High
Point game points at 14-13 before
recording the victory.

The match had everything we
havecometoexpectfrom Davidson
volleyball; Holt Hathaway directed

traffic from her setter position and
set up the cannon spikes of hitters
Mimi Plauche, Amy Howard and
Janet Delery. Hathaway, though,
received an uncharacteristic rest
during the final game. In the past,
lack of depth at the setter position
has forced coach Rebecca Hawk-
ins to play Hathaway virtually from
wire to wire. In thismatch, Hawk-
ins gave Davidson volleyball fans
a glimpse of the future when she
inserted freshman Lorie Logan into
the lineup at setter. The transfer
was a smooth one; Logan took
charge immediately and guided the
reserves to their final game win.
Davidson returned to action

over the weekend at the Piccadeli
Tournamentat Appalachian State,
where they defeated Big South foe
Winthrop 15-10, 15-7, 15-8, and
fell to the host Mountaineers 15-
13, 13-15, 16-14, 12-15, 8-15.
