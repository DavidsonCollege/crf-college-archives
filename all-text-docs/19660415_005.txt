While everyone has his mind on Spring Frolics, and
no one really cares what is going on in Johnston Gym,
Davidson’s other basketball season, the recruiting sea-
son, is heading toward the crucial stage.

Among the confusing and endless terms like Da-
vidson Letter of Intent, National Letter of Intent, grant-
in-aid and gentlemen’s agreement, Coaches Lefty Driesell,
Warren Mitchell and Terry Holland are like mother hens;
sitting gingerly on their eggs while looking for other | 3
hens’ eggs to add to their nests without pulling a Coach, ‘
Grick from “Gil'Thorpe” fame. |Ppe

The situation of Davidson’s recruiting procedure is!

of acception or rejection yesterday.
The only assurance Driesell has that a prospect will

come to Davidson is his word, a gentlemen’s agreement. | ,._
He may sign a Davidson Letter of Intent, but it only ex-
plains the terms of the grant-in-aid the player will re-

ceive.

_ All the marbles rest on May 17, the first day on’
which a high school senior may sign a National Letter ,

of Intent, which is, in effect, binding. Actually, this doc-
ument is neither national nor legally binding, but the
majority of institutions in the country agree to honor
ths document as final indication of a player’s choice.

So until May 17 Driesell does not have a single
player wrapped up. Those eggs must be kept warm in

their Davidson sweatshirts.

But Driesell has a gentlemen’s agreement with
Jerry Kroll, a six foot-five inch All-Stater from Houston

Memorial High School.

Besides jeading his team to the

Texas state championship, he was the only unanimous
choice to the Texas dream team.
Kroll was accepted Early Decision and will sign his

Davidson Letter o

Intent when he finished his high

school sports career, a Texas rule.
_ Another red-hot high school senior is Mike Malloy,
a six foot-seven inch prospect from Hallis, N. Y. Heling the Harvard match called
was here last weekend, and according to sophomore
Wayne Crumwell, “He was very enthusiastic about Dav-
idson.” A study of his credentials as a student reveals
he should have no trouble qualifying for admission, and|netters defeated The Citadel.
Crumwell describes him as “very impressive, pretty good
on the floor and a great rebounder.”
He was most impressed with Davidson by the way
people come up and spoke to him. Crumwell, who spent
a lot of time with him, noted, “I think Mike would make

not only
si

ically also.

The word on Charlie Scott comes from many sources.
It is complicated and there are many factors involved,
but there is a general consensus that Scott is coming to
Davidson this fall. He has signed a Davidson Letter, but

is still visiting college campuses.

Besides Davidson, he

has been to Duke, North Carolina, West Virginia and
Providence, whose All-American Jimmy Walker is a

Laurinburg graduate.

Wayne Crumwell indicated that Scott is impressed
with Davidson and its academic standing. Driesell em-
phasizes that Scott’s word is enough to convince him that
Davidson will be Charlie Scott’s alma mater.

The most meaningful statement is Crumwell’s:
“Charlie has said he will be going to Davidson.”’

“We've all been very well

exclaimed Assistant Coach Dick

Continued Coach Tomey,
“Our shortage of manpower

to hold a dummy or help out in
any way.”

“We expect to run our first

Tomey. “Up to now, our prac

IMAC Softball Begins With A Boot

By K. D. WEEKS
Davidsonian Sports Writer

The IMAC’s spring soft-
ball season has arrived and
brought with it a new look
in fraternity competition.
The outlook for the coming
season highlights 13 organ-
izations that were in the top
three at the end of last sea-
son.

Actually, the E's finished first.
followed by the SPE’s and the
Pikas, but to hear a typical in-
terview of the other fraterni-
ties, one would think that every
team was last year's greatest.
So, the following rundown on
this year's softballers will list
the first teams in order, alpha-
betical order.

When asked about their team,
the ATO's representative quick-
ly responded, “Well, we don't
have nine players yet, but...
we ao have Rufus Adair's ter-
rific arm and a couple of hit-

ting standouts. For instance,
Dave Orr hit a home run in
the last game but forgot to run
(he was tagged out at home).
The infield looks tough. Stokes
has worked a lot on getting the
ball from first. to third.”

The Betas have an undefeat-
ed pitcher in Frank Powell (he
is 1-0) and the antics of Jump-
in’ Joc Rice to spice the con-
tests. They also “hope to have
the usual strong hitting of Jim
Timmons.”

The KA’s have a lot to be
proud of already, killing the
Kappa Sigs last week, 12-5. ‘‘We
don't expect to lose a game,”
quipped a confident KA. “We
finished high last year, and we’re
holding a lot of veterans—no
standouts, just nine good ball
players. Well, you might say
Tommy Hunter stands out right
much."*

The Kappa Sigs have been
pretty much saddened by their
start but have hopes for a few

breaks in the future. They
dropped a thriller last week
when. with a 5-4 margin over
the KA’s in the top of the sixth,
their hurler,, Allen Rogers,
came to the mound in relief.
He held the KA's to eight runs
and the Sigs fell, 12-5, in a
shocker. ‘With Goodstein and
Kendrick in the field, we ought
to have quite a season,’ one
added.

The Phi Delts made no bones
about it. “We ought to win
without much — competition.
Squier should be tough if he'll
play. Our infield will be im-
penetrable, if you don't hit the
ball too hard to them, and when
we get the hair out of the
Beatle's eyes, he'll be an out-
fielder again.”

The Phi Gams are the only
team thus far to have used up
all its potential! in the first in-
ning and then lose the game.
“But we'll come along.” It was
released as a hint to the opposi-

tion that with Gary Waldron be-
hind the plate, everybody gets
second base free.

The Pikas, who term them-
selves as ‘“‘damn good" have
the Fabulous Four C's in the

infield: Johnny Clark, Mike
Carroll. Tom Cook and John
Callender. There is also a

strong hitting department, with
Bob O'Kelly at cleanup.

When asked of some hum.
orous aspect of their team to

lighten this article. the Pl
Kapp’s snapped. ‘‘Why. the
whole team’s funny. We fin-

ished deep jn the second divi-
sion last year, and this year,
well . . .° Their one standout
is Mac Fiddner. who is ‘not
much with the stick but a great
glove man.”

The Sigma Chi‘s claim to have
a team full of clowns, but they'll
be strong with Ronnie Stone.
Ellison Tusser and a few other
hot hitters. ‘

The SAE’s will be feared again

‘this year, if Neil McBryde sports

his lucky ripped pants which]:

brought them the title last year.
Randy McKnight the ‘“‘shortest-
stop’ in the league, should hold
the middle together and Chet
Davidson plans to carry the big
stick.

The. Sigma Nu’‘s took the
SPE's last week, 8-3, and got
crushed by the E’s in another
contest. ‘It's gonna be a long
season, but at least we have
vigorous cheering.’’ quipped a
Nu player.

The SPE‘’s, “Well. you win a
few, you lose a few.” This has
become their theory. ‘‘We are
the best this year even though
we have already been beaten
by the worst. We did whip the
Sigma Chi’s last week, but we
got all the breaks. Also, you
might say Richard Mayvan is
the whole team, ask him."

There is no word yet from the
Independents. It is rumored
that they have some holdouts.

ForMalletMeet

A violent break with tradition will occur to-
morrow—the croquet challenge match will come
off as scheduled, DAVIDSONIAN editor-in-chief
Louis Lesesne assured the Sports Department this

week.

“This event has been scheduled several times
in the past few years,” Lesesne stated, “but one
of the teams always finked out at the last minute.”

This year assurances have been received from
both The Miscellaney and Quips and Cranks that the
two publications will serve as the traditional lambs
at the slaughter at the hands of THE DAVIDSON-

IAN malletmen.

“Our greatest strength lies in our depth,”
Lesesne commented. “It’s really going to be a prob-
lem narrowing down our team. Several of our staff
members have varsity experience and any of them

will do an excellent job.”

The match is set for 1:30 p.m. tomorrow on
the front lawn of Chambers.
DAVIDSONIAN sports editor Tom Cook, look

ing ahead ‘to

tomorrow’s

match, commented,

“We've really got a wicket team.”

Taus Slip By Sigs

Special To
The Davidsonian

In a. game that was close all
the way. the ATO’s éaptured
the IMAC. basketball title with
a 6360 victory over the Kappa
Sigs last week.

The victory gave the Taus an
I!-1 season record, one game
ahead of the second place Gams
and Machis. ‘

Both teams -were cold from
the floor in the opening minutés
but the Taus’ rallied behind the
shooting of Mike Payne and Pat
Hubbard to chalk up a 31-25
lead at halftime.

The Sigs, however. were not
ready to give up as they pulled
within two, 4543, after three
quarters. The credit for the
surge was attributed to the foul
shooting and the ball handling
of Ray Garrison.

In the final quarter the lead
see sawed back and forth as

each team pulled to- 4 point
leads but ‘could not hold them.
With the score tied. 6060, the
Sigs took, possession of :-the ball
and called time out. with one
minute to play.

Obviously looking for one last,
good shot, the Sigs cautiously
moved into position for the shot
that would win the game. The
Taus’ defense, however would
not give them an open shot.

With less than 20 seconds on
the clock, Garrison drove the
lane but was unable to shoot.
The ball was batted to Payne
who fired a baseball-type pass
to Tau teammate Hubbard who
laid in the winning goal, add-
ing a little icing with a final
foul shot: ,

Topping ;the scoring column
were Hubbard and Payne who
pumped in 15 and 12 points re-
spectively for (he Taus and
Garrison who hit 25 for the
