Around the horn

Cosell asked the tough questions

By HAP BRYANT

“Two hundred years ago was
really swell/ We didn’thaveto put
up with Howard Cosell.”—Mo-
hammed Ali

When Mohammed Ali was in
his heyday, Howard Cosell was
the American sports broadcaster.
People disliked Cosell because he
caused controversy. He liked
debates, and he stood up for his
principles--ethics and journalistic
integrity.

So people like “The Greatest”
didn’t like him. Dogma had no
place. with Howard Cosell. He
demanded proof for boasts, which
upon occasion Ali could provide.
Atother times, he could not. Then
Cosell called his bluff.

Admittedly, I didn’t like How-
ard Cosell that much then either. I
thought he had a big mouth. I still
think so. However, now I like
what he has to say. In the seven-
ties, I was just akid. Now, witha
little bit of maturity, I can see the
valid points that Cosell was mak-
ing.

When I read his book J Never
Played the Game last summer, I
recognized that Howard Cosell is
adying breed in sports journalism.

Granted, sports journalism still
has its characters--Bob Costas,
“The Boomer” Chris Berman, and
“The Commissioner” Todd
Donoho--but they lack the insight
that Cosell possessed. He trans-
formed sports issues into ethical
questions, making hard-hitting

commentaries about the sports
business.

From his background as a law-
yer, Cosell was able to attack the
legal bases of sports. In particular,
he questioned franchise moves,
like Al Davis’ move from
Oakland to Los Angeles and
Walter O’Malley’s move from
Brooklyn to Los Angeles.

Though these issues are passé
today, Cosell. would undoubtedly
find another issue to attack, as the
sports business is full of iniquities
and vices.

But Howard Cosell was not
some deity. J Never Played the
Game is largely an outlet in which
Cosell defends himself and criti-
cizes his. detractors. However, it
raises many points that are rele-
vant to sports in general, and it
makes one question the basis of
decision-making.

Howard Cosell is not coming
back to the broadcast booth. Al-
though it did not end his career
entirely, the Alvin Garrett episode
was the last straw in Cosell’s al-
ienation from the sports broad-
casting business. Certainly, he
can remain financially sound with
awealth of speaking engagements
and his radio show, “Speaking of
Sports.”

But where did Howard Cosell
leave the business of sports jour-
nalism? Surely, he left it in a
better state than that in which he
found it, but it seems a compla-
cency has befallen the industry.

Reporters and television an-
nouncers seldom ask the gut ques-
tions of the sports business. They
seem satisfied to leave those is-
sues to news reporters.

From my own experience I
know it’s better for knowledge-
able sports people to examine the
problems in the industry, instead
of letting newspeople with abso-
lutely no knowledge of the par-
ticulars (like John Barrow) try to
stick their little generalizing plati-
tudes into a realm that they do not
understand.

So, Mr. Cosell, where do we go
from here?

Hopefully, we can make prog-
ress. After all, that’s the whole
purpose of society, isn’t it?

It’s going to take some hard
work to tackle the issues confront-
ing sports, both professional and
college, today. The sports jour-
nalism industry owes a profound
debt to Howard Cosell for making
us realize that there are stories
behind the scores.

I realize I am omitting such
figures as Frank Deford, whose
insightful sports journalism has
continued the traditions of How-

. ard Cosell. However, the majority

of sports journalists today are
content to tell the scores, show the
highlights, and joke about the
outcomes.

My fear is that the world will
soon be full of Harold Johnsons,
and we will have forgotten How-
ard Cosell.

The game of the week had to
be ours. In perhaps the last time
the Thundering Herd will ever
invade Johnston Gym, the
never-say-die Wildcats
snapped Marshall’s seven game
winning streak with a thrilling
79-76 victory.

The Cats, still hanging on to
second place in the conference,
kept their hopes alive for a shot
at the championship. Marshall
(8-2) leads Davidson (8-3) by
only a half game.

The team to watch down the
stretch is Furman. The Paladins
have won three out of their last
four and are tucked neatly in
third place at 7-3. Furman’s
most recent win came Monday
with a 67-66 squeaker over Ap-
palachian State at Boone. Gary
Churchill scored a layup, as a
steal set up the final possession
with 21 seconds remaining.

The fourth place Mountain-
eers, who had won six straight,
dropped to 5-4.

East Tennessee is holding
fifth place with a 6-2 record.
The Buccaneers have been
hanging tough with some good

teams. The lost to Furman 91-89
in overtime and to Marshall by
only five. However, last week,
they did come away with a 97-90
win over.The Citadel.

The disappointment of the
year is Tennessee-Chattanooga.
The Moccasins are 14-8 overall
but they are struggling in 5-4.
Twoof UT-C’s tough losses have
been to Marshall, 95-94 in over-
time, and to VMI, 68-61.

VMI, Citadel and Western
Carolina make up the bottom
three of the conference, respec-
tively. Until Monday night, VMI
hadn’t been playing that badly.
The Keydets beat Tennessee-
Chattanooga, took Marshall to
OT in a 95-91 loss and beat
Davidson 59-55. Monday, they
were trounced 77-61 by East
Tennessee.

The Citadel has lost seven out
of its last eight and ‘is in eighth
place. Western Carolina (1-9)
moved into last place by losing
its last four in a row.

It’s a crazy conference. The
teams are so inconsistent that it is
very common for one team to
lose to somebody, say VMI, and
then turn around and beat some-
body like Marshall.
