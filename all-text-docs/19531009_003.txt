for as long as, the

can remember and for
longer than most avid
Davidson fans will
admit, the Wildcats
have been’ winning
mostly the so-called
“moral” victories and
all too few of the type
that show in the rec-
ord books as actual
point-margin victories.

dropped 5. In that year (1943) the team scored only 6 points

while the opponents were piling up 125.

Paradise—No Losing Seasons for 8 Years
For eight year between 1929 and 1937 the Cats enjoyed
their longest stretch of winning football fortunes. It was dur-
ing this period that the Davidsonians piled up 38 wins as

against 30 losses and 7 ties.

The worst pounding ever taken by the Cats came back in
1921 when they were snowed under by, of course, Georgia
Tech by a 77-0 margin. There have been brighter days for the

Cats against Tech vaunted machine for in 1900 and then again
in 1902 Davidson downed the Georgian’s by 38-6 and 7-5.
However, in the 11 times since that the Cats have met Tech he
there have been eleven Tech wins. *

The worst drubbing ever given any Davidson team was
an 87-0 rout of Wofford. The year—1921—just two weeks
after they had taken a 77-0 beating from Tech.

Davidson’s first loss came at the hands of Charlotte in

a 12-4 decision and the first win came over Bingham by 12-4

in 1896. Davidson has played Harvard only twice (1937 and}.

1952) losing both encounters.

State-D.C. Games Comparatively Low Scoring
The Cats have never scored over 20 points on State in
one game in the 43 games between the two schools, and State
has never run up more than 40 points on the Cats. The largest
margin of victory for the Pack came in 1948 when they won
40-0. Davidson’s largest margin came in 1900 when the Cats
toppled State by 17-0. The Cats have beaten State only twice

the last mile.

In this way he believes the
team will have more spirit and
drive, enabling the co-captains,
Sparks and Shipley, to keep the
team running at a steady pace.

Coach Whittle says the team is
almost a week behind in training
becausé of rush week and the loss
of sleep. He feels if they hadn't
lost this time they would have

been in much better shape for the}.

meet this afternoon. Also a few

of the men have been plagued with |‘

colds.
Show Improvement

Some of the men who have im-
proved over last year include
Floyd Feeney and Andy Turner.
Turner, who is a sophomore, is
doing exceptionally well, however,
the surprise of the season is Dick
Lovette. This is sophomore Lov-
ette's first year on the team and
he is improving very rapidly.

Those who ran in the contest
this afternoon for the Wildcats
include Homer Sparks, Floyd
Feeney, A. Turner, Dick Lovette,
Archie Joyner, Hershal Allen,
John Handley, Paul Alexander, Joe
Caudell and Larry McIntosh.

Shipley Out

Bill Shipley did not run this
afternoon because of doctor’s ord-
ers, however, he will be back with
the team in a week or ten days.

The meet which was held this
afternoon with Maryville will also
count as time trials for the engage-
ment with Richmond next week-
end. The first eight men to cross
the line for Davidson will journey
to Richmond and represent the
Wildcats there.

Richmond Host

Richmond lost some of their
hest men last year and- Coach
Whittle feels we will have a very
good chance against them.

The remaining meets are as fol-
lows:

October 15 — Richmond at Rich-
mond.

October 24— William & Mary;

N. C. State at Williamsburg.

October 31—VMI-W&L (triangu-

Ben Craig, Wildcat football captain, will be out possibly for

He will be sorely missed at his tackle position tomorrow against

Wildkittens Runners
Opened Schedule
With Phieffer Today

Coach Sam Magill’s freshman
cross-country team met their first
test this afternoon at 4:30 on the
local course when they faced the
Phieffer Junior College team.

Pete Ashcraft, a freshman from
Amherst, Mass., was expected to
lead the long distance Kittens.
Pete set a new course record a
few weeks ago in winning the
frosh cake race. He has been the
leading runner in all the fresh-
man drills and time trials to date.

Ashcraft First

In a recent two and a half
mile trial run, Ashcraft posted a
14 minute 6 second mark. Coach
Magill remarked that this was well
paced for a_ pre-season drill.
Second in the trial was Gordon
Bondurant, a Winston lass who

Senior Neil Graham at the other
tackle slot will now take over as
captain of the Cat footballers as
he was the alternate captain be-
fore Craig’s injury. Graham has
been a steady competitor for the
last two- seasons and is a valuable
member of the forward wall.

In the line, Harry Peterson will
go at his usual position at center.
Dickie Davis, vying for All-South-
ern honors, and Bob Patten will
hold down the guard positions.
Harold Davis has been switched
from guard to tackle to replace
Craig. Davis played defense last
year in the two-platoon system and
has seen considerable action this
year. Neil Graham will be at the
other tackle.

Patterson Back

The ends will be well-manned by
McCall, Kaiser, and Patterson. Pat-
terson will be playing his first
game of this season tomorrow
night against State. He was in-
jured in a pre-season practice and
has seen no action.

In the backfield Henry Brown
has been switched from quarter-

should develop into a good run-
ner.

A Reminder...

All Davidson students and
faculty: members can gain ed-
mission to the North Carolina
State-Davidson football game
in Raleigh tomorrow night
simply by presenting their IO
cards. This pass is good only
at the East side, South gate.
Game time is 8:00 p.m.

Joe Brown, Johnny Holshouser,
and Frank Kiker finished next, in
that order, and were all considered
as good prospects for this first
meet.

. Baker Outstanding

Ted Baker, one of the frosh
squad's best, did not compete in
this particular time trial, but
did enter this afternoon’s
race for the Wildkittens. Ted was
a track standout and captain of
the team at Woodbury Forest, and
has been pushing Pete Ashcraft
since finishing second to the
blonde-haired freshman in the
cake race.

to Phieffer for a return meet. The

and the Little Blue Devils of Duke.

along with Rowland will direct the
attack against State from the quar-
ter-back position.

“Fleet-footed” Thacker, who
coped All-Conference honors last
year will be at his usual left-half
position; and Fargason, big ground-
gainer in last week’s freshman-
varsity scrimmage, will go at full-
back to round out the backfield.
Harley Smith, a transfer student
from Alabama, is also expected to
see considerable action.

West Sparks

State will be led by the passing
of their quarter-back Eddie West,
and the running of full-back Don
Langston. West passed for 189
yards against George Washington
last week. Langston scored State's
only tally; he also scored their
only touchdown against Carolina.

-D’Angelo and Kapp head State’s
big line. D'Angelo is also the extra-
point man and is vying for A.C.C.
honors this year.

State Favored

State is rated by the majority
of the sport-writers as two-touch-
down favorites, but the Wolfpack
could easily be surprised. Coach
Dole and his team are going to
Raleigh with the idea and the will
to bring back Davidson's 12th vic-
tory over State in the long rivalry
of the two schools.
