Bill Scouten’s Spoof of the Week

Welcome back. to’ David-
son’s world of spoofs. . . this
week flowed over with suitable

material and proved to be quite

entertaining.
I have heard of cats being
kept by the hundreds in a house

in New York, City, or even.

dogs. In fact, I remember the
SPCA raising quite a ruckus
over the ‘inhumane conditions
that a certain lady’s countless

birds were kept in. But what do.

you do about a must colored
flamingo that is being abused
* and is, in effect, a pressure re-
lease for students at Davidson?
It seems that the girls on
fourth Richardson have shel-
tered a rust colored flamingo
named Marlene and now claim
it as the hall mascot. Once loved
by all, Marlene is treading in the
waters of death. Scorned by hall
residents, Marlene now lives a
quite indecent life, being
abused, threatened by sharp ob-
jects; and forced into many un-
comfortable positions. (How
would you like your neck tied

e

into knots?) But this is just the
beginning. Monday night Mar-
lene was thrown out of the
fourth floor window. (Luckily,
she survived.) The most shock-
ing bit of information, how-
ever, is the fact that the hall

: ag Counselors of fourth Rich are

said to beat and kick the
flamingo. Someone call the
SPCA! This situation must be

acted upon... rust colored,
inflatable flamingoes have
rights too!

Quite often Davidson is
likened to an upperclass pres-
sure cooker, but when royalty is
actually sighted on campus, you
know something is amiss.
Saturday night six self-proc-
laimed kings graced the David-
son campus. It was said that
they were wisemen, proclaim-
ing their divine right; they were
on a mission from God. The
Watts Kings spread cheer and
good tidings in the post-MCAT
revelry early into Sunday morn-
ing. Did you chance to see their
eminences?

On a more serious note,
have you thought of starting a

- chain letter?? Well, don’t, it has

already been done! But this is

no ordinary chain _iet-
ter... Fred Burrel started a
chain | this past week, but

attached to it was not only the
address, but a piece of lard.
‘Yes, a piece of animal fat! Al-
though he has received a letter
from ‘Boston, its first destina-
tion, with the lard intact, the
question still remains: how long
will the readers bear the odor
and appearance of moldy, rot-
ting lard . . . care to wager,
Fred? (Oh, by the way, it’s a
great way to make new friends!)
Did any of you ever see Ani-
mal House? I’m sure most ail of
you have; it’s a great National
Lampoon flick! The decade of
the fifties: was a great time; a
time of experimentation, ex-
panding suburbia, parties, and
last, but certainly not least,
goldfish. Yes, goldfish were
very important, especially to
the fraternities. Did you ever

-year an

swallow one? Well, in the ’SOs
room, during a Union freshman
mixer, Ingrid (Vanna) Love
stood behind five daring
freshman ready for what would
be a reenactment of a fraternity
“hell week” prank. She stepped
up to the table, ready for that
scaly, slimy goldfish to slither
down her throat to its ultimate
sarcophagus... and it did!
Why? Ingrid said, “I just did it.”

Speaking’ of goldfish, I
think a moment of silence is in
order for Stan the goldfish} for-
merly owned by Tina Laidlaw,
that died this last week (no, In-
grid did not eat it) I have been
assured that it lived a happy and
fulfilling life. I was shown a
sympathy card sent by friends
of Stan. It read: “In these times
of sorrow, let it be known. that I
once lost a Stan of my own.”
Tina did state emphatically,
however, that there is a surviv-
ing heir to the fishbowl, Ed. He
is desperately in search of a
mate. (Poor Ed!) He has bulg-
ing eyes and a great personality;

do you know of any pos-
sibilities?

Have you ever lost a car?
No, not a matchbox car, a real,
honest-to-goodness car.
Perhaps you haven’t, but two
unsuspecting, naive, innocent
young men did suffer this
plight. Joe Treadway and Low-
ell Stokes, both of Second East
Belk, pulled into spaces that
they thought looked “just fine,”
but when they looked for their
cars days later, they were mis-
sing! The verdict . . . towing.
Towing is not only to be desig-
nated as a spoof, but if the habit
continues, you will run-up a
very expensive tab. Beware!
Watch where you park and
when you park. The policeman
lurks behind the hedges of park-
ing areas just waiting to pounce.

So have a great week and
watch out, "cause you never
know when that spoof will jump
out and get you! Right, Lewis?
Oh, by the way, do you sleep on
a mattress outside of Belk every
Saturday night?
