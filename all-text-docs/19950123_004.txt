Residence Life faces an overwhelming midterm season

By Beth Lindsey

When Davidson students
headed home to enjoy Christmas
vacation, staff members of the
Residence Life Office braced them-
selves for a chaotic midterm sea-
son.

RLO staff member Debby
Young is in charge of coordinating
room vacancies and availabilities
for those students who are chang-
ing their housing status. She says,
“Ithas been absolutely overwhelm-
ing. This has certainly been the
most challenging midterm season
for me personally in the past ten
years.”

The pace of Young's job
picked up in the fall of last semes-
ter as she began her investigation
of those who would be leaving or
returning for the spring semester

of 1995. Young says, “It’s just
difficult because there is no over-
all list of all those abroad and no
guarantee when they will return.
In fact, many offices depend on us
for that sort of information. Room
changes involve not only the coor-
dination of available rooms with
students. but also changes in the
entire voice mail system and in
student information obtainable at
the Union desk.”

Students who were abroad for
the fall semester of 1994 had the
option of putting themselves on
the waiting list for a room when
they returned this spring. Those
students on the waiting list were
given first priority. Says Young,
“The waiting list is absolutely sa-
cred. I go right down the list and
call each and every person giving

them the current room selection. If
he or she does not choose to take an
available room at that time, that
person will go down to the bottom
of the list and wait to see what is
left.”

With the help of the informa-
tion found on both the waiting list
and on the housing survey taken
early in the fall of last year, RLO
was able to predict that there would
be a record number of women re-
turning this spring and that there
would be very few room vacan-
cies. In order to create more space
for returning female students, the
decision was made early to fill the
Patterson Court house, PAX, with
women and to allow five more
women to live off campus.

The housing ordeal of the mid-
term season involves not only stu-

dents returning from abroad but
also students trying to make
changes due to roommate difficul-
ties. Young says, “I would defi-
nitely say that there were more
room switches due to roommate
problems on the whole, and espe-
cially in the apartments this time.”

Due to these early indications
of possible housing problems, RLO
was able to make a total of 164
room changes, finding a place for
all returning students to live. While
there are some juniors who had to
be placed “down the hill” in Irwin,
Akers, and Knox, Young says there
have not been many complaints.
Despite preliminary fears of some
overcrowding, there are still a few
vacancies.

When asked if the larger per-
centage of acceptances for the cur-

rent freshman class had anything
to do with the ordeal with housing
this year, Young says, “We have
recommended to admissions that
numbers of incoming freshmen
need to be cut, and they have really
taken heed by lessening recruiting
this year. It is always a guessing
game, though. We simply have to
fill as many beds as possible in
order to fund the maintenance and
the operation of the dorms.”

The enormous number of
housing changes has also affected
the resident advisors. Lori Blue, a
junior resident advisor on fourth
Sentelle, says, “I had seven new
people move onto the hall this se-
mester. We had to have hall meet- _.
ing the first week back primarily
just to get to get to know each
other.

Outside group to study

alcohol use

on campus

early this week

By Russ Tarver

A nine-person team from the
Governor’s Institute on Alcohol
and Substance Abuse, Inc. will
spend this Monday and Tuesday at
Davidson. The team will consist of
a psychiatrist, a health educator,
an attorney, and a couple of stu-
dents as part of their Campus Al-
cohol Student Health Initiative pro-
gram. :

Dean of Students Tom
Shandley explains that the purpose
of this visit is not legislative, but
will “assist the administration, fac-
ulty and students in their efforts to
promote a healthy and safe cam-
pus environment.”

The team will have discus-
sions with a wide range of stu-
dents, faculty, and staff represent-
ing all aspects of campus life.

“They are concerned not about
use of alcohol or alcohol laws,

they’re concerned about abuse of
alcohol,” says Shandley. “A report
released this summer talked about
alcohol as the number one health
problem among college students
in this country. They are looking
at alcohol use in colleges all across
the state. “ Chapel Hill, UNCC,
and’ Duke are all participants in
this program.

The report is intended solely
for the use of the college. “‘They’re
not doing a state-wide report. It’s
intended only to help us,” says
Shandley. “This is a group that has
no vested interest in Davidson.”

Some students question
whether the study has anything to
do with self-selection weekend.
Shandley insists that the timing is
“nothing more than coincidental.”

The Governor’s Institute will
report their findings and sugges-
tions within six weeks,

nominated Rusk as his Secretary
of State. Retained by President
Lyndon B. Johnson after
Kennedy’s assassination, Rusk
witnessed several monumental for-
eign policy crises, including the
Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Cuban
Missile Crisis, heightened tensions
with the Soviet Union, and most
notably, the Vietnam War.

The Vietnam struggle

Throughout this tumultuous
decade, Rusk displayed a deep loy-
alty to the office of the Presidency
and aconsistent opposition tocom-
munism. Historian Warren Cohen
notes that like fellow Davidson
alumnus President Woodrow Wil-
son, Rusk firmly believed in ex-
tending the blessings of democ-
racy and in the importance of mul-
tinational organizations to “over-
see universal adherence to agreed
principles of international behav-
ior.” As Secretary of State, Rusk
was quite proud of his assistance in
adding eight years to the period in
history in which no nuclear weap-
ons were fired in anger.

While some of Dean Rusk’s
policy decisions were the focus of
sharp criticism, his strong charac-
ter made manifest by his steadfast
adherence to a set of fundamental

_ values was universally respected.

Henry Kissinger once claimed that
Dean Rusk-“set a standard of pa-
triotism of public service that will
never be exceeded. He was a great
American and a great human be-
ing.” President Clinton remarked
that while the world has changed
greatly since the 1960s, Dean
Rusk’s principles of promoting
freedom and opposing tyranny “are
as vital as ever.”

Despite his notoriety, Dean
Rusk maintained important links
to Davidson. Davidson President
John Kuykendall remembers Rusk
as “a man of principle and good-
will.” Rusk always spoke posi-
tively of the College, made numer-
ous trips to campus, and was in-
volved in a very successful 1987
campaign for’ Davidson.
Kuykendall notes that Dean Rusk
exhibited the character one wants

in a Davidson graduate. Rusk al- -

ways maintained that Davidson
graduates were those who would

‘make a difference in the world.

In 1950, the College awarded
Dean Rusk an honorary doctorate
of laws. In 1985, the International
Studies Program named in his
honor was established. Ambassa-
dor Jack Perry, Director of the Dean
Rusk Program, notes that Rusk
insisted on a living program dedi-

cated to the needs of the student
body, not another building named
in his honor. Perry describes Rusk
as aman of the highest stature who
never forgot his roots and always
exhibited a sincere concern for oth-
ers. Ambassador. Perry has con-
sciously tried to model the Pro-
gram on three of Rusk’s core val-
ues: humility, unpretentiousness,
and the seriousness of foreign
policy.

Dean Rusk was often criti-
cized for his rigid Cold War analy-
sis of the Vietnam War. But too
often today’s decision makers con-
sider only the input of domestic
political advisers and feasibility
analysts before intervening in
world affairs. For better or for
worse, Secretary Rusk’s decisions
were motivated by his firmly
grounded values. A full account of
Dean Rusk’s life must include his
impact on world leaders and on
Davidson students to consider the
value of standing firm on one’s
moral convictions.

A memorial service conducted by
President Kuykendall will be held
for Dean Rusk on February 20, at 4
P.M., atthe Davidson College Pres-
byterian Church. ;
