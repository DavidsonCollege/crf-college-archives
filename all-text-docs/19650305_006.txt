‘Big Idea’ Draws Praise

(Editor's Note: The follow-
ing article, written by Dav-
idson student Bedford Alken,
reviews “What's the Big
idea?”, a series of four plays
concerning modern man, his
frustrations and false gods.
The production was given
by the Theatre of Concern
and sponsored by the Dav-
idson YMCA.)

A Review

Someone asked me to write
something about a group of
plays I saw called ‘‘What's The
Big Idea?” Well, I'm not real
avell-versed on the tribal cus-
toms governing the writing of
critiques.

1 guess you're supposed to
@ell all the people who didn’t
come just what happened, and
what you thought was good, and
what you thought was bad, and
what people are supposed to
think about the play. Just fill
up the space on the page with
stuff like that, and you're a

cream of the crop.”

At 8:20, Hodson Hall was cov-
ered by an emptimess which
has come to be expected at
Davidson, but would be coh-
sidered rude anywhere ‘else.
To my knowledge, there was
not one faculty member there.
On the sage were two of those
wooden chairs like you see all
over the Fine Arts Building Uf
you ever go over there. There
were some clothes drooped on
the chairs.

Finally Norman and Sandra
Dietz realized that out there
was all the audience they were
going to get for their perfor-
mance at. Davidson. So they
walked on the stage and started
talking.

They did four plays and pro-
ceeded each one with a pseudo
spontaneuous lecture. Then they
launched into some kind of diar
logue. The first one. “The Well-
Spoken Acrobat,’ labored too

Christ and his role in human
salvation. As could only be ea-
pected, the allegory broke down
in the same spot as the keryg-

and that doctrine that says this
was all God's plan. The drama
as a device for story-telling
far outshined the story itself.

“It?s almost as if Santa

he explained that 15 David-

new Chevrolets for a 30-day
evaluation.

“This evaluation,” con-
tinued Burts, “is purely

After the performance, Mr.
and Mrs. Dietz came out and
talked to a group of students
in the chorus room. There were
some of those questions asked
that everybody already knew
the answers to.

One of the best remarks was
made by Mir. Dietz. “Same

BASKETBALL CAMP

Details concerning the basket-

son for four one-week sessions
were g:ven to the faculty by
Martin. He explained that there
will be 100 boys attending each
session, and a‘though not de-
signed solely for such a pur-
pose, the camp should prove
to promote good public rela-
tions.

The 15 students, chosen by
Burts and Director of the Col-
lege Union C. Shaw Smith, were
picked, according to Burts, ‘to
represent each fraternity. Lingle
Manor, andi Independents.”

Good academic standing was
necessary and the students were
also selected as seniors who had
been active as campus leaders
and were: met who showed “a
willingness to talk and have
ideas.” The students are: John
Barrow, Dick Bates, John Bord-
ley, Pete Crow, Don Davidson.
Rufus Hallmark, Jim Hardwick,
Tommy Heffner, Will Jackson,
Bill Jacots, Zach Long, Gary
Martin, Art Ross, Rick von Un-

“The banquet will probably be
the finest ever held at the Col-
lege Union,” said Burts, explain-
ing that Chevrolet was furnish-

J.C. Green, assistant manager
of Chevrolet’s National Owner
Relations Department will host
the banquet. At this meeting
there will be an hour-and-a-
half discussion with the men
who receive the cars to learn
their impressions of automobiles
in general.

This information will be taped
and combined with the critiques
of the Aew Chevrolets .by the
students to be used with simi-

Davidson was suggested as 2
possible evaluating school by
S. T. Ball of the Chevrolet Div-
ision in Charlotte afier talking
with Dr. Warner Hall, a trus-
tee of ithe college and minister
of Covenant Presbyterian Chuch
in Charlotte.

This type ef evaluation has
been recently adopted by Chev-
rolet, which. in the past gave
one person: in a test group of
about 20 people the use of a
new car.

The new method of limiting
the numUer of participants and
increasing the number of cars
is felt will increase the accur-
acy of the study and provide
the company with more defin-
ate suggestions and evaluations.
