CAPT. CRUTCHFIELD

Another Davidson graduate has
fallen in the Korean theater in the
service of his country. He was Cap-
tain James H. Crutchfield who was
reported killed in action November
4, 1951.

It is thought that his name was
confused in the recent mixup over
POW lists among the Korean bel-
ligerents.

While at Davidson, Captain
Crutchfield was active on the var-
sity football squad and in the
ROTC unit, While in Korea he was
serving on the company level.

Insurance History
Told B. S. Students

W. H. Trentman, executive vice-
president of the Occidental Life
Insurance Company of Raleigh,
spoke to a group of students in the
business and economics department
at Davidson this morning.

Mr. Trentman is the first of four
life insurance executives who will
visit the campus in coming weeks.

A well known speaker at life in-
surance meetings, Mr. Trentman
told the students about the history
and philosophy of life insurance.
His lecture engagement was ar-
ranged by A, G. Grififn, professor
of economics and business at Da-
vidson.

Draft Test
Hopefuls Told
To Send Forms

All eligible students who intend
to take the Selective Service Col-
lege Qualification Test in 1952
should file applications at once for
the April 24 administration, Selec-
tive Service National Headquarters
advised today.

An application and a bulle-
tin of information may be ob-
tained at any Selective Service
local board. Following instruc-
tions in the bulletin, the stu-
dent should fill out his appli-
cation immediately and mail it
in the special envelope pro-
vided.

Applications must be postmarked
no later than midnight, March 10,
1952. Early filing will be greatly
to the student's advantage.

Results will be reported to the
student's Selective Service local
board of jurisdiction for use in
considering his deferment as a stu-
dent, according to Educational
Testing Service, which prepares and
administers the College Qualifica-
tion Test,

Expect Girl Reps
At Y Talks Here

Several women’s colleges, in-
cluding Agnes Scott and Queens,
will have, along with many men’s
colleges, representatives on the Da-
vidson Campus during March 14,
15, and 16, for the YMCA -confer-
ence sponsored by the Davidson
College Y under the chairmanship
of Jim Speed.

The study conference has two
purposes, The first to let the
Davidson College Y learn operating
ideas from the various schools
present, and the second is to give
the representatives of the colleges
present a chance to examine critical-
ly their organizations and to gain
ideas from other colleges.

Duke, the University of
North Carolina, Wake Forest,
Clemson and Vanderbilt are
a few of the colleges that have
been invited to participate in
the discussion groups that will
discuss two topics: the pur-
poses of the YMCA, and a
method of putting these into
action.

The main speaker at this con-
ference will be Dr. Robert Boyd,
pastor of St. Andrew's Presbyte-
rian Church in Charlotte.

Mr. Edward Driscoll, secretary
of the Southern Area Student
Council of the YMCA, will also be
here to help Dr. Boyd in leading
the discussions,

The final plans for the con.
ference have not been com.
pleted, but many of the 17 col-
leges are making plans to at-
tend it.

All the visiting representatives
will be guests of the Davidson
YMCA and it was thought that by
thus removing a part of the travel
expense factor a greater attend-
ance might be obtained. Each
institution has been invited to send
two delegates.

Invitations have been sent to the

All that remains of the Protector of Minerva in front of the
SAE fraternity house is this concrete base, from which the cast
iron lion was separated by some heavy sledge-hammer work. An
“acquisition” from the SAE brethren at Washington and Lee, the
lion, painted black, was to have been dedicated as a shrine of the
local chapter in ceremonies tomorrow. The ceremonies, needless to
say, have been cancelled.

Still No Answer
To Lion Litting

By JIM ALLEN
What is THIS? That delightful creature, the object of
much discussion recently in frat court, the beloved and much-

pampered mascot of SAE, Leo

the. Lion, has been forcibly re-

moved from his pedestal of concrete, leaving as momentos only
four mangled paws and a stubby tail behind him.

These pitiful remains are all that
that is left to remind his loving
keepers of their far-departed pet.
Woe unto the perpetrators of this
awful deed!

An Alien by Birth

Leon's origin is rumored to have
been the rum-laden campus of
Washington and Lee, whence he
was spirited away to Davidson by
two aspiring zoologists of the local
SAE chapter,

With noble purpose and fearless
hearts they transported the stately
beast in the dead of night to their
own haunts, intending to mount
him in splendor on a permanent
slab of cement.

But, alas, someone took a dim
view of these preparations, and
with malice aforethought, expressed
their sentiments by a very ignoble
deed.

In the Night They Came

Unknown to but a few, Leo was
designated the main objective of a
midnight demolition squad, and
these amateur Rangers accom-
plished their mission without mis-
hap.

Where the lion has been secreted
is yet a mystery to the anxious

pledges of SAE, but many suspects
have been finger-printed by the
detective bureau in charge of find-
ing lost lions.

Knew His Women

One of the many accomplish.
ments of the talented beast was
che infallible ability to detect un-
blemished females at a glance.

Every time one of these monu-
ments of morality sauntered by,
the animal would loose a lang, low
growt and shaké his t@ three
times.

This valuable loss is slated to
leave a considerable gap in the near
future when graceful lovelies pass
the honored. portals of the SAE
house.

Anyone knowing the whereabouts
of said lion, or any information
pertaining to his disappearance,
please contact a member of said
fraternity, and he will be duly re-
warded.

The chapter is particularly anx-
ious to regain this virtuous beast
as soon as possible, since the fate
of many revolves around Leo's
judgement,

Week

Greek Week on the Davidson campus is a success in the
eyes of the IFC, reports the program engineer Dick Stockton.
He was optimistic after the first attempt to replace a useless pre-
initiation week of stunts among fraternities here.

He further opined that thought
cooperation was general good,
there seemed “not enough concen-
tration on the ultimate goal of the
program.”

Pete Kalogridis, head of the
clean-up squad, was very pleased
about the job his workers did around

Outside Talent

There will be some outside talent
added to the cast this year
though it was not hinted that there
was lack of it among the students.

No definite schedule has been
completed therefore no list of acts
or castings has been prepared for
the annual expedition into non-
sense and light entertainment.

Past years have seen the presen-
tation of minstrel shows and other
assorted acts by the gentlemen ath-
letes, The vision of football players
performing ballet and wrestlers
gently engaged in a pas de deux
has drawn a perennially large audi-
ence to the spring extravaganza.

Big Formal Ball
Begins Weekend

Taking a momentary rest from their rebellious mood toward
the faculty and administration this weekend, students are settling
down for a period of delightful though nonetheless thorough
domination by members of the so-called gentler sex.

Festivities for
weekend will get
this evening at a formal dance in
the Johnston Gym beginning at 9
p.m, and lasting until one a.m.
Music will be furnished by Charlie
Spivak and his orchestra.

Tomorrow afternoon the swains
and their ladies will be treated to
a gamut of activities which com-
mence with a wrestling match at

two p.m., with VMI and terminate |

with a tea dance after the mats
are rolled up from the gym floor.

Theatre,

When the actors take their places
for the opening performance of a
three-day run, they will have seen
an idea become a reality for this
marks the first theatre-in-the-round
production ever given in this area.

The two one-act plays which
have been selected are aimed

the town and at Erwin Lodge.
Although he mentioned that
attendance was not 100 per
cent, he complimented those
who were engaged in the tasks

Something that was perhaps not
entirely obvious to most of those
working on the project was the
enormous gratitude the town feels
towards community work such as
this.

Kalogridis voiced the hope that
“Greek Week will be continued in
later years,’ and expressed his
thanks to the pledges.

The Greek Week Foolies, di-

considerably.

Goley was praised for his dili-
gence and effort in the direction
of these skits, and the pledge
classes themselves “deserve due
credit for their preparation and
choices of material.”

The supper exchanges were help-
ful in mixing the pledges with their
own class, while the meeting of
the fraternity officers proved fruit-
ful in bringing mutual problems to
light,

at providing a well-balanced

evening of entertainment, one

being a comedy and the other

a drama of a tragic nature.

The plays are two of the finest
of their kind ever written and they
are by two of the world’s greatest
playwrights, George Bernard Shaw
and Eugene O'Neill, %

The Shaw play, “How He
Lied to Her Husband,” is filled
with clever, witty lines based
on a simple story, the eternal
triangle, with an usual ending
that is calculated to leave the
audience laughing.

As a young, dashing and some-
what bold poet, Vance Mizelle
makes his fourth appearance on
the Davidson stage and his second
of the year, having played the
short-lived playboy in “Ten Little
Indians.”

Besides his theatrical work here,
Vance played with the Fort Lauder-
dale Little Theatre and spent last
summer as a member of the Lake
Summit Playhouse crew.

As the wife, Elizabeth Gripe
makes her Davidson debut.
Before coming to Davidson
Mrs. Gripe was active in many
dramatic productions and ma-
jored in speech at Elmira Col-
lege in Elmira, N.Y.

Completing the cast is Tad

Tad’s seventh role at Davidson, hav-

Faculty Nays
Any Vacation
At?Semesters

\s a direct result of recommenda.
in last week's closed
meeting of the student body, the
faculty has extended Thanksgiving
for next year, and has
10 minutes to the present
lunch period, president of the stu-
dent body, Mac McLean, has an-
n vunced.,

The Thanksgiving extension will
embrace November 27-30, and was
achieved by a request, submitted by
a group from the student couneil,
by President McLean, to
the faculty meeting that was held
on Tuesday of this week.

sy the time this paper goes to
press, the 10 minute addition to the
lunch period may already be in ef-
fect, as the faculty ruled to change
the schedule as soon as the auto.
matic bell system could be altered.

Another item that was
brought up by the student
group was that of having a time
lapse of some days between the
end of the first semester and
the beginning [of the second
semester. The faculty voted
against this measure.

According to McLean, the next
closed meeting of the student body
held on February 22, at
time the findings of the
committee investigating the elec-
toral system will be put forward.

This committee is composed
of men who hold varying views
as to what the needs of the
electoral system are and their
ideas as to the remedies.

This one item is expected to fill
the meeting, and there is
planned a full presentation of all
sides of the question,

Although the initiation of
new members was the highlight
of the meeting, certain social
plans for the semester were
announced.

It was the hope of the organi-
zation to combine interests with
the Senior Class and sponsor a
dance to be known as the Military
tall on March 7 before the seniors’
dance on March 8.

The Idea of Scabbard and
Blade was to make a week-
end affair of the two func.
tions.

It seems, however, that because
of certain controversy, these plans
may not be carried out.

Because of this Scabbard and
Blade plans to present their Mili-
tary Ball at another date during
March or April.

Another tenative function of
the fraternity is a tea dance to
be given on the afternoon of
April 5.

On this day some of the students
from one of the nearby girls’ cam-
puses will visit Davidson and be
the guests of Scabbard and Blade
at the tea dance. |

That evening the YMCA is
planning further entertainment
for the visitors.

After the initiation and business
were complete, the members en-
joyed a feed at Erwin Lodge with
