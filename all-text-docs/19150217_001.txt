Inter-Collegiate Debat-
ing Teams Selected

Following New Plan, Two Teams
Selected From Contestants.

Last Friday night. February 12, the
finals in the debating preliminaries were
held in Shearer Hall. he object was
to decide as to who should represent
Davidson in the two inter-collegiate de-
bates to be held this spring. The ques-
tion for discussion was, “Resolved, That
an alliance of all the American nations
should take the place of the Monroe
Doctrine.” The affirniative was upheld
by F. W. Price, Cooper, Rowan and
Neal; the negative by Alexander, Cham-
bliss. F. H. Smith and Patton. ‘The
Yudges were Drs. Lingle, Currie, Sen-
telle, Douglas and Harding. The whole
debate was characterized by a lot of
“pep” and some fine talent in the art
of argumentation was displaved. ‘Those
selected by the judges for the teams
were: Price. Smith, Alexander and
Rowan, with Patton’ and Neal as first

alternates. The judges also dectded that:

Price and Smith should debate against
Emory at Agnes Scott College. with
Patton as alternate. and that Alexander
and Rowan should debate Clemson at
Winthrop. with Neal as alternate. “Vhe
debates are scheduled for April 4. The
question to be debated with Clemson
is, ‘Resolved. That immigration should
be. further restricted by the imposition
of the literacy test.” “The question with
Emory has not been fully. decided upon
as vet.. ,

Davidson is making a departure trom
her usual custom this vear by putting
ont two debating teams instead of one
The outcome of this plan can not b
definitely decided vet. but by the de
bates last Friday night it was seen tha
there would be two strong teams pur
out. and if other colleges do this there
is no reason why Davidson can not, The
debaters will begin their work immedi
ately and with two such teams David
son will be well represented at’ each
debate.

ORCHESTRA AND GLEF. |
CLUB TO TAKE TRIP

The Davidson Orchestra and Glee.
Club expect to take an extensive trip in
the near future. They will start the first
of next week. Monday night they will
give an entertainment at Winthron Col-
Jege, Tuesday night at Toccoa, Wednes-
day night at Brenau, Thursday night ‘at
Greenville Woman's College, and Fri-
dav night at Easley. S. C.

The Orchestra is composed of ten
men; four violinists, a pianist. two cor-
nets, a flute. a bass violin, and drums.
These men have been practicing for a
lone time and they will undoubtedly
make a hit.

Altogether there will be fiften or six-
teen men in the partv. The Glee Club
is composed of several men of the Or-
chestra and a few others. There are
among them several splendid voices. All
expect to hear great things of David-
son’s Orchestra and Glee Club.

Dr. Richards. the pastor of the Pres-
byterian church, has made it his custom
to visit the students of the college in
their respective dormitories and rooms
on Mondavs. For the past several weeks
he has followed this plan. and the stv-
dents want him to feel that a hearty wel-
come awaits him in each room. It is
hoped that Dr. Richards will find it
possible to continue these visits through-
out the vear.

BOPHOMORE BANQUET PLANS

At a meeting of the Sophomore class
last week it was decided to postpone the
annual Soph banquet from March 1 to
April 5. Because of the fact that the
former date would follow very closely
the meeting of the Lavmen’s Convention
which a large number of the class desire
ro attend. it was decided that the latter
date would be more acceptable to the
whole class.

At the same meeting representatives
fram the ather classes to this banquet
were elected as follows: Senior class.
Norman Iehnson; Junior class, U.P.
Williams: Frechman class. T. W. Black.
Farly lace fall Dre, T M. McConnell
and T. M. Douglas ard Prof. A. Currie

were chacen as faculty representatives.

CHARLOTTE HIGH SCHOOL
TO PRESENT PLAY

Tt was rumored on the Hill last week
that the Charlotte High School would
bring their amateur plav to Davidson
and present it Fridav night, but on ac-
count of the final debate being scheduled
for the same night it was postponed un
til a later date. Arrangements have
heen made far them on March 12. The
plav is entitled “The Hoodan,” and is
said to he presented ina splendid wav
hy the pupils of the Charlotte school.
Tt has been presented hefore an audience
in Charlotte and received much praise
by those who saw it.

Base Ball Prospects for
the Season Promising

Practice Started In Earnest With
Large Number Trying Out.

With ten days of good weather, the
spring base ball practice has started in
real earnest, and every afternoon can
be found a large sumber trying, out fer
the team. Sprunt Field is a place of
central interest: to all those athletically
inclined, and although it is vet too early
to draw anv definite conclusions, the
prospects for one ot the best teams for
many years ts very promising.

Many old’ men are back, among them
being Alford, Somervillg, Christenbury,
Brown, Stough and Walker. All of
these men have proven their worth by
their previous: stellar playing for Dav-
idson, and it ts to be expected that they
will be better than ever during this
spring. Te was doubttul’ last fall) chat
all of these men would be able to re-
main during the year, and it has raised
the percentage of the prospects to a large
extent, since they decided to return.

One of the most decided advantages
that the team will have this vear, over
the Jast few vears at least, will be the
coaching of “Bil Fetzer. He came at
a most difficult time to take the place of
his brother, “Bob” Fetzer, and he has
already proven to be one of the most
popular coaches that Davidson has had
for many vears. Tt will be hard for a
man to be better liked than was the last
fall’s coach, Bob Fetzer, who sa. suc-
cessfully coached the foat ball team, but
his brother bids fair to stand along side
of him in the estimation of every stu-
dent,

One of the exceptionally strong feat-
nres of the coaching of “Bill” Fetzer is
his success in developing winning  pitch-
ers. “The report has it that ino a few
weeks he has the pewer to absolutely
“make” a pitcher out of an aatried man,
and while this will not be necessary this
vear, still he will have an opportunity to
haw his powers in this — direction.
On acount of a series of unexpected cir-
cumstances, none of the best of — last
vear'’s pitchers have returned this spring,
and it is going to be practically a new
staff whe will be counted on to help
win Davidson's games this vear. How-
ever. there is much goad material to
work on, and some half dozen men are
heing tried out for these places The
reperts are that thev are showiag up
much better than was ever expected by
even the most optimistic.

Mamnaver Shaw has arranged a sched-
ole sehich will comnare favorably with
the best that Davidson has ever had,
ith more dates both on and away
fram the Hill, than the team has had
for manv vears. One or two dates have
sot finally been fixed, but the com-
nleted schedule is promised in. a short
time. Tt is said to include something
like cix ar seven cames on the Hill, one
or two in Charlotte, and about cight
more off the Hill.

With the continuance of gand weath-
er, the team should he able to get in
same goad nractice at ance and be in
prime condition for the bard) schedule
which will soon start Already several
nractice games have bees plaved. and
the field is getting into fine shape.

NO. Y. M. C. A. MEETING

tion wf Davidson men attending the
