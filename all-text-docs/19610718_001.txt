THE CRITICAL D VIDSO11T-iy

During trbg winter term hee
at Davidson, there was much cri-
ticism of the lack of tutorial
courses and other courses that
give opportunity for critical sur-
vey of a ficld. Yet, in the cours-
es of the more conventional type,
there has been a sad lack of cri-
tical thought.

Some professors, in their lec-
tures, have intentionally made
comments that were invitations to
criticism ond question, yet the
only response they received was
the scratch of pen in notebook.
This would seem to be poor evi-
dence of our capacity for critical
thought.

Professor Patterson, of the
Econolics Department, gave a talk
in chapel. during the year.in which
he was highly critical of some of
the more conservative organizations
in politics and was roundly cheer-
ed. Yet, professor marrotte vas
soundly hissed for uttering a "dis-
paraging" remark about Senetor
Goldwater by many of the: same peo-
ple that cheered Professor Patte r-
son. Is this evidence of critical
thought ?

This is evidence rather of a
profound laziness - a willingness
to accept ell thet is laid before
us. e can ill afford to criti-
cize college policies until the
day comes that we have come to
terms with our own shortcomings
in criticzl thoucht.
