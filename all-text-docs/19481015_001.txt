Planned Freshman Revolt

By SHELLEY BEARD

At the first meeting -of the ’52
Freshman Class several important
issues’ were discussed, including a}
Queens-Davidson Day, a court to
punish offensive seniors, and the
casting of a special medal called
the Bingham Cross to be awarded
to all freshmen who have appeared
before the Court of Control, with
small clusters of laundry bags to be

given for all subsequent appear-

It was decided to have a hayride
from Davidson to Charlotte. It is
rumored that Professors H. T. Lil-

son, will be asked to act as chap-
erones.

As the second topic of discussion,
the senior problem was considered.
It seems that certain freshmen were
having trouble getting seniors to
tay off the walks. To remedy the
ituation, it was decided to set up
1 board of freshmen to try of-
‘nders of the senior code. How-
