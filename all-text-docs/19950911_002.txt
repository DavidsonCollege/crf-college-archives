Davidson stinks

“Maybe it’s justa good year forskunks”

By JASON MCMULLAN

Yes, the rumor is true.
Davidson College has been in-
vaded.

They can be seen every-
where— wandering in front of
Chambers, lingering behind the
dorms, stretching their legs on
Richardson Field. No longer con-
tent to hide passively in the shad-
ows, they now boldly stroll in the
moonlight.

No, the invaders are not fresh-
men, but skunks.

The cute little critters have
been overly abundant this fall, and
no one is sure why. Sure, there are
plenty of speculations and edu-
cated guesses; people have pro-
posed everything from a cool, wet
spring to the new abundance of
trash from students moving in.

Professor Verna Case,
Davidson’ s resident animal behav-
ior expert, and Professor -Mark
Stanback, a vertebrate field zoolo-
gist, think the best explanation is
area deforestation from recent con-
struction.

Case offers a lack of predators
as anotherexplanation. Foxes prey
on most smaller, slower animals,
including skunks. However, be-
cause of their pungent spray,
skunks in general are pretty safe
from predators. Stanback specu-
lates that “maybe it’s just a good
year for skunks.”

Both professors describe these
animals as opportunistic and highly
adaptable.

Skunks are omnivores, mean-.
ing they will eat anything that they
can get in their mouth. The glut of
garbage in dumpsters and trash
around Patterson Court houses pro-
vide a bountiful buffet for the
skunks.

As for avoiding the spray if
one of these creatures is encoun-
tered On aromantic moon-lit stroll,
make no sudden movements, “Let
the skunk go about it’s business,
and don’t do anything to make him
feel threatened,” suggests Case.

“Leave it alone,” agrees
Stanback.

“It probably won’t attack, but
will come after you if it feels cor-
nered. If you ever see a skunk
coming for you, it’Il probably squirt

pretty soon,” he warns.

If one gets sprayed there is
one suggested remedy: bathing in
tomato juice.

“T guess there is something
about the chemical make-up of to-

mato juice that. detoxifies the
spray,” says Stanback.

“But,” he adds, ““youcan bathe
and bathe all you want and will still
stink.”

As for clothes ... burn them.

they see someone who seems not
to belong in the dorm. However,
they discourage students from con-
fronting strangers.

“TI don’t have any reason to
believe [the thief is violent],” says

Moore. But he cautions that if
comered, any thief can become
violent.

Moore says the Campus Po-

Sentelle thefts. “We wouldn’thave
been in the dorm,” he says. Moore
also believes that the students do
not want police officers patrolling
the dorm rooms at hight.

According to Moore, the card-
access security system “is only as
good as the people who use it.”

Moore and Thrower are not
considering changing the dorm
security system anytime soon. For
instance, both men say they don’t
have the resources or personel to
post a guard at each entrance to
every dorm.

Moore considers the card-ac-
cess system to be very effective
despite the recent robberies. “Lar-
cenies from dorm rooms the year
after the card was put in wentdown
80 percent,” he says.

As of Friday afternoon, the
police were examining the print-
out of 120 students who ran their
cards through Sentelle’s front and
back doors on Tuesday between
12 AM and 6 AM. “We’re inves-
tigating it [the robbery] and doing
all we can with the information we
have at this point.”

The police are asking students
who entered or left Sentelle be-
tween those hours if they noticed
any strangers hanging around
Sentelle and if they could provide
a description of whom they saw.

course

Davidson Outdoors will be
hosting an intesive 36-hour
backcountry emergency medi-
cal training course. The 36-hour
course in Wilderness Advanced
First Aid (WAFA) will take
place in Davidson from October
7th to the 10th.

Wilderness Medical Asso-
ciates will provide the instruc-
tion for the course. According
to Wilderness Medical Associ-
ates’ Leslie McClain, Wilder-
ness Medicine differs from regu-
lar first aid in thtee respects.

First, transport times are
measured in hours and days
rather than minutes. ~ Second,
severe environments signifi-
cantly increase the comlexity,
pressure, and danger to patients
and rescuers. And third, limited
equipment makes improvisation
and resourcefulness essential.

The course will have morn-
ing lectures, while the afternoons
will be spent applying the infor-
mation from lecture. At least
one realistic simulation, com-
plete with fake wounds and stage
blood, will be conducted.

This course is recom:
mended for all outdoor enthusi-
asts and others who spend time
in remote areas. Graduates will
be certified by Wilderness Medi-
cal Associates.

Moore warns that there is a
“fair chance” that whoever com-
mitted the Sentelle thefts will re-
turn, because the thief will feel he
has gotten away with the crime and
that Davidson is an easy target.

On Friday morning a student
on Third West reported being
awakened by a stranger who en-
tered his room at four AM. The
stranger left as soon as the student
woke up and did not steal anything
from the room.

Moore says that normally he
would simply consider this a case
of a drunk student wandering into
the wrong room, but given the
events of Tuesday morning he is
not ruling out that the two events
were committed by the same indi-
vidual.

A strong link between the
events of Tuesday and Thursday
night is “possible, given the time
of morning,” says Moore.
