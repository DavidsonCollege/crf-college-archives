MESSAGE TO ALUMNI.

Our columns this week carry news of
the college to over three thousand
Alumni of Davidson. We hope that we
have accomplished our purpose, which
is to compel you to stop, and think, and

then, when memories of the old days:

come trooping back, that you will drop
everything and make arrangements to
come back to the campus again. Every
thing seems to indicate that a record-
breaking crowd will return for this
Commencement. Be one of that) num-
her. A cordial welcome awaits you.

‘A YFAR OF SPLENDID
! WORK BY Y. M.

The past year has been in many ways
ane. of the most successful i in the history
of the Davidson Y. C. A. The
life of che men has been on a higher
level than usual; and the spirit among
them aac of helpfulnes, and of standing
tor what is right.

The Fall campaign, which was led by
Dr. W. R. Dobyns, was very inspiring
and helpful. His talks were messages
direct from God and were all the more
powerful hecause they were simple. Mr.
W. S$. Golden, of the class of 1913, a
leader during his college days, was a
great help te Dr. Dobyns and to the
men during the meetings. The weekly
meetings of the Association have been
good, and the attendance considerably
larger than last vear. A special feature
was the series of life-work meetings led
hy students.

In the Rible and Mission Study de-
partments the work done has been good.
The semester plan was adopted this
vear; the Bible Study classes being held
in the Fall and the Mission Study classes
in the Spring. Two hundred men were
enrolled in Bible Study, being divided
into fifteen classes and using four courses
of study. The average attendance was
82 per cent. About the same number of
men were enrolled in Mission Study:
four courses being used, two in home

and two in foreign missions. “The final |
average of attendance has not been made
up, but to date it is higher than that of
the Bible Study classes. About $400
‘has been raised to, support a missionary
in Korea.

At a meeting held the latter part ot
November nearly $400 was subscribed ;
by students and members of the faculty!
for the erection of a cottage at Blue
Ridge. About $250 has been paid on
these subscriptions and the Association
expects to raise the additional $250 nec-
essary to pay one-half the cost of a cot-
fane. Queens College is to pay the other

half

Four Sunday Schools reaching over;

two hundred people, having preaching |

services twice a month, have been con-
ducted by the Association. “lhis Spring:
a negro night school was organized.
The thirty pupils are taught by ten of
the students.

A plan is now on foot to raise ‘poe
with which to fit up the old Y. C.'
A. hall as-a social center. “I'he Mitene

authorities have promised to give $200 |

if the students will raise $300. The’
need for such a place in which all the!
activities of student life would center in|

e Y. M.C. A. is keenly telt; and it is
i ‘be hoped that the students and friends
of the college will rally to the support ‘
“Ithis olan.

The last act ot the old cabinet schich|
retired May 15 was to inaugurate the:
plan of floor praver services each night.
At 10 o'clock the men on each floor
gather in one of the rvoms and are led
in a short praver service by one of their
number. These services have been well
attended and helpful. The prayer life
among the men has been more real this
vear than usual.

We must not foret the splendid work
of the President, Frank’Price, who has
perhaps done more for Association work
than anv other Davidson man. He has

CAMPUS IMPROVEMENTS
BEING PLANNED

Ata recent meeting of the Y. M. C.

A. Cabinet definite plans were a
lated for the conversion of the old Y.
M. C. A. hall into a Social Center for
the use of the students. The college
has offered to give $200 to the remodel-
ing of the building if the Cabinet can
raise $300 more for its equipment. This
is to be done as far as possible, outside
of the student body.

The plan suggested calls for the re-
moval of all the partitions. replastering
and tinting the walls, etc. The old stair-
wav is to be taken out, and a new one
built on the outside of the building: a
door replacing the double window which
now opens on the second story porch
This plan will give more room both in
the social center and in the gymnasium.
A small committee room is to be built
in one corner of the building for infor-
mal gatherings. The equipment is to
be complete with tables, chairs. games,
magazines, etc., and the room is to be
heated bv a large base-burner above.
This will provide a general meeting
place for all the students.

Several plans are under consideration
by the college authorities for further ex-
tension and permanent improvements
a{during the coming summer. These
plans include the calcimining of — the

walls of the dormitories, the putting in
of steam heat in Shearer Hall, the in-
stallation of a new heating plant in the
Chemical Laboratory, and the building
of a house on Concord avenue for one
of the professors. Better sanitary con-
ditions are also being planned for the
college houses. not already connected
with. the sewerage system. The Camp-
bell house will be renainted and_neces-
sary repairs made at the same time.
