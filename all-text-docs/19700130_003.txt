‘Cat Cagers Ink

‘Initial Prospect G

By B. B. BARREL
Sports Writer

In .an all out. effort to

avoid the late recruiting
start which cost the Wild-
cats so many basketball

prospects last season, head
coach Terry Holland an-
nounced the signing of this
year's first: prospect, Joel
Frost.

Frost, a 6-9  pivotman,
paced his Milford High team
to the New Jersey state
championship last season as
they dropped only one of
23 games. Frost averaged
25.8 points per game and
snared 18.7 rebounds. In the
second half of the title con-
test, he exploded for 21
points to clinch the Milford
win.

Bo Brickels and Neill Mc-
Geachy, Davidson assistant
coaches, have nothing but
words of praise for Frost.
Brickels, who saw him per-
form last season on a scout-
ing trip for Rice, said,
“Right now I think that
Joel could step into the line-
up and take Mike Maloy's
place. His mental attitude
has slipped a bit this sea-
son, but he can do every:
thing on the basketball
court.”

Brickels added “I think
that Joel could be the next
all-American here at David-
son. He has that much po-
tential.”’

(McGeachy pointed to
Frost’s extreme agility and
quickness for a man his
size. ‘He has all the moves.
I think that Joel’ could be
the real big man that David-
son has been looking for."

Frost, avho received of-
fers from over 90 schools,
including UNC, South Caro-

Wil

».into

lina, and UCLA, said that
the school was what led
him to choose Davidson.

“I wanted to go some-
where I could be accepted
as a student as well as an
athlete. Davidson is a good
school and everyone I met
there was just great.”

Gil -Thorp,
school mentor,

Frost's high
was perhaps

the key individual in Frost's +

decision to attend Davidson.

Thorp said, “I've met all
of the Davidson coaches and
I have, been very impressed
with them and the program
at Davidson. , Joel is still
trying to find himself and
I encouraged him to look
Davidson as an _insti-
tution as well as a_basket-
ball power. I just wanted
him to find the right school.”’

In‘ an unexpected move
the NCAA has taken action
against Davidson College for
illegal recruiting practices.
The college has been barred
from any post season com-
petition for this season and
next season as well.

The suspension came out
of an investigation of the
recruiting practices of
head swimming coach Tom
Stevens. Stevens allegedly
broke several of the NCAA
statutes concerning relations
between college coaches and
high school athletes.

In announcing’ the decision
of the NCAA, Vice-Presi- .
dent - at - large Wilford H.
Ketz pointed specifically to

t Football Builds

For National Crown Bid

Well, I've never

that the NCAA has put
and our football program.
Now that we have been sus-
pended, we might as well
make hay while the sur
shines."

That was/the reaction of
Davidson head football
coach Homer Smith to the
announcement that) the NC-
AA had placed Davidson un-
der a two year suspension
for illegal recruiting acti-
vities on the part of the
swimming team. ‘

“We can build up quite a
program in two years with
no restrictions,’’ Smith said.
“The suspension was abso-
lutely the last straw. Now
we can go big time all the
way.”

The suspension and a
change in the NCAA rules
have caused considerable ©

changes in the football sche-
dule for next season, Most
of the conference schools re-
fused-to-honor-their-commit-
ments to play the Wildcats,
but Smith and Athletic Di-
rector Dr. Tom Scott have
been able to line up replace-
ments since the ‘NCAA has
made it possible for each
team to schedule 11 regular
season games. The Wildcats
have contracted with six
new teams to replace the

Leading the list of new-
comers are Florida at Char-
lotte, Virginia, Tech at
Blacksburg, Ohio State at
Columbus, Ohio, and Baylor
and Toledo at Davidson.

“We feel that several .of

these teams can give us a
very good game on any
given Saturday,” Smith

said. ‘‘A couple of them will
serve as a very good indi-
cation as to just’ how far
along we are in our drive
for a national champion-
ship.”

Woody Hayes, Ohio State
head coach, said of David-
son, ‘The game should be
a real game for the crowd.
I have nothing but the high-
est regard for the fine
things that Homer has done
down there with the limit-
ed resources available. I am
very concerned about his
ground game and I'm sure
that my boys share this con-
cern. I just hope we can
move the ball against their
defense."'

One unusual feature of the
game is its designation as
the Davidson Homecoming.
This is particularly hard to
understand since the game
is being played ,at Ohio
State.

Scott and Union Director
C. Shaw Smith defended the
decision saying, ‘We're sure
that we can have a much
better time in ‘Columbus
with all the ‘co-eds and night
spots there.’’

Scott added, “‘We certain-
ly ‘didn't want to lose our
homecoming on our home
field, that could have been
embarassing.”

Smith, however, has been
laying careful plans for the
big games scheduled for
next year. “Last year
against some of the teams
like’Toledo and Vanderbilt,
we found ourselves outman-
ned both on offense and de-
fense. I vow that this will
not happen this year.”

Taking advantage of the
NCAA suspension handed to
Davidson, Smith has re-
tained seniors Gordon Slade,
Mike Kelly, George Hannen,
Whit Morrow and Steve But-
ler. In addition to these
Wildcat standouts he has
also activelys recruited grad-
“gating seniors fromm ‘other -

major college powers and
has reportedly landed run-
ning backs Steve Owens and
Bob Anderson to bolster the
running” ga

An NCAA’ spokesman said
that the organization was
very unhappy with the Da-
vidson football situation but
that the group could take no
action since Davidson .is al
ready under suspension.

Smith said that he expects
the Board of Trustees to ap-
prove subsidized football at
their meeting next month.
Trustees have indicated that
they will not only opprove
of subsidized football but
that they are also willing
to pay more if Smith can
mold. a_ national champion

The International Mafia
Athletic Club opened up two
new seasons this week and
the early favorites were up-
set in both,

In the pool action the form
chart was upset at the be-
ginning as outgoing SGA
president Peter Hobbie

President Samuel R. Spen-

Spencer said, “I was as
surprised as President Nix-
on would have been if some-
one had hit the first ball

excuses, Peter just played a
fine game and deserved to

Hobbie termed: the win the
“high point of my ahtletic
and political careers."’

After the ceremonial game
between the two presidents,
the pre-season picks follow-
ed Spencer's example and
fell with amazing regular-
ity. The top rated ATO's

of money that the institu-
tion can spend on him at
such visits.

Stevens, according to
Ketz, has made up to seven
paid visits to several pros-
pects. In addition when the
students were on campus,
Stevens reportedly paid for
meals at the Wildcat Den
and the Coffee Cup instead
of making use of the school’s
cafeteria) resources.

Stevens is also accused of
arranging dates for the pros-
pects at several of the near:
by women's’ colleges and
has organized other off cam-
pus entertainment for the
visitors.

The suspension will espec-
ially hurt the Wildcat bas-
ketball team which is  bar-
red from NCAA tournament

Coach Terry Holland said,

pointment for the boys and
me, too; but we'll just have

In addition the Sigs top

There is still some ques-

decided whether they get

The work on

ern Conference. tournament
now."

Stevens was unavailable
for comment on the suspen-
sion and on the alleged viol-
ations, but sources «close to
Stevens indicated that he in:
tends to resign.

Davidson Athletic Director
Tom Scott termed the sus-
pension ‘‘out of proportion
to the offenses. I know Tom
Stevens and I know that he
would not do anything that

was less than in total com-

pliance with the spirit as
well as the letter of the
rules,

“He has done a tremen-
dous job in building up the
swimming program here at
Davidson in the last couple
of seasons and IT want him

President Samuel R. Spen
cer , Jr. has notified the
NCAA that the school will
take care of the problem
immediately.

The Southern Conference
members will meet tomor-
row morning in Lexington,

Virginia, to decide on Da-
vidson's future  participa-
tion as a member of the
conference.

Several schools, notably

The Citadel and East Caro-
lina, plan to submit a_ pro-
posal to ‘drop the Wildcats
from future participation in
the conference.

Just last year Marshall
was suspended from the
Mid - American Conference

after the NCAA disclosed re-
cruiting violations at the
West Virginia school.

at the University of

architects in charge, Blasel

and Hollinsford of Chapel
Hill. ‘

James T. Blasel said of
the plans, “We're really

looking forward to the pro
ject. Basically what we will
be doing is-enlarging the
pool area and increasing the
seating capacity for basket-
ball gameS and other events
held in the gym. This means
that we are going to have
to expand both upward and
downward at the
time.”

Blasel indicated that the
Johnston Gym project will
be thé most ambitious un-
dertaking of its type in the
country, but is now quite
workable due to advance-
ments in plastic technology.

Final plans for the gym
include seating capacity for
another 21,555 for basket-
ball games which leads to
a possibility of more home
games on campus instead of
Charlotte. Currently how
ever; no plans have been
made for additional parking
for the future fans. Robert
Currie, Davidson College
business manager, said that
the parking at present is
capable of sustaining the
needs of the school.

The gym is also to be re-
novated with considerable
attention given to accoustics
so that Johnston’ Gym rather
than Love Auditorium can
be used for the: concerts on
big weekends. The swim-
ming complex will require
the most construction work
as current plans call for an
entirely new pool on the
site of the old one. The new
pool will, however, be at

same

a much Jower- level so that
seating for,home meets will
be arranged on a ser of
stadium basis, with seats
rising on both sides of the
pool.

The new capacity of pool
seating will be-in the area
of 900 according to the blue-
prints. Blasel indicated that
the college ha’ retained the
option of requesting an un-
der water observation win-
dow. The purpose of the
window would be for watch-
ing the technique of the var-

sity swimmers as well as
serving as an excellent lo
cation for watching — syn-

chronized swimming.

While the work on the
gymnasium complex will be
more revolutionary, the
work on. Richardson  Sta-
dium may be more spectac-
ular to the casual observer.

Following the plans which
the University of Toledo is
using to convert their Glass
Bow] stadium into a dom-
ed field, Davidson also-
plans to construct a domed
complex, The domed sta-
dium would be the first .in
the Southeastern region:
Blasel and Hollinsford indi-
cated that the Richardson
dome would encompass ap-
proximately eight thousand
more seats than the cur:
rent 3500 capacity.

Scott denied that David-
son has contracted to spon-
sor a post season bowl game
in the staduim, but admit-
ted that since ward of the
project has leaked, several
parties have contacted him.
The stadium will also serve
as one of the largest indoor
track facilities in the world.

still not sure just —-where
we'll be seeded but the
tournament officials have
promised that we will not
be in the same half of the
draw as the varsity."

The Southern Conference
decided to invite the  all-
stars after they whipped
Richmond 8749 in an ex
hibition game last Tuesday.

The Southern Conference
tournament director had
some difficulty persuading
the Keydets of VMI to give
the IMAC all-stars their
place in the tournament but
VMI finally gave in when

Dallas Shirley, Southern’

Conference executive,
threatened to put VMI
against the Wildcat varsity
in the opener and not allow
any substitutions.

Martin, who will act as
coach, said, ‘‘With a little
luck, we could go all the
way. The varsity may prove
to be tough in the finals, but
we plan to change our name
to St. Lefty's for the oc-
casion and pretend to be a
Catholic university. That
should turn the trick."

At the regular IMAC busi-
ness meeting, the group re-
jected a proposal by Zack
Mobley that rugby be made
an intramural sport.

Also defeated was a pro-
posal to. demand that ‘tHe

varsity not practice in the _

gym during IMAC basket-
ball season. The council
agreed to accept a challenge
from) Queens College for a
touch football championship
game.

Scott announced today
that University *of Maryland
Head Basketball Coach
Lefty Driesell will return to
Davidson next year-as an
assistant coach in the Wild-
cat coaching ranks.

Driesell left Davidson last
spring. to become the coach
of the Terrapin squad, but
after some negotiations with
Scott and Maryland officials,
has decided to return to
Davidson as an assistant to
Head Coach Terry Holland.

The’ vociferous coach who
gained national recognition
for raising Davidson basket
ball team from the joke
books to the Top Ten, had
recently expressed dis-
pleasure with the Maryland
system.

“Shucks. It’s not that
they're against basketball at
Maryland,”  Driesell said.
“Actually it’s just the op-
posite. They expect too much
out of them Turtles."

“Besides,"' Driesell add-
ed, ‘‘up there I'm recruiting
against all kinds of  con-
gressmen and fancy people;
I want to come back here
where I can compete against
people like (Duke coach)
Bucky Waters, (Carolina
coach) Dean Smith and (re-
feree) Otis Allmond."’

Expressing an _ extreme
fondness for Davidson, Drie-
sell noted, “It will be good
to get back to my old stomp-
ing grounds.”’

Holland, the first athlete
recruited by Driesell, was
asked about the problems
that may arise from having
his former coach under his
wing, but seemed unwor-

.riedabout any problems.

Rather philosophically,
Holland commented, “‘If it
hadn't been for Lefty, I
wouldn't be here today.”

“He's a great recruiter
and he'll add a lot of color

its construction with eager-
ness. “It will give us some
of the finest facilities we
could have hoped for,” said
Whittle. Martin added, *‘It
will sure be a lot warmer to
run in there than outside
in the winter.”

Football coach Homer
Smith was also optimistic
about ‘the new facility's ef-
fect on the Davidson athlet-
ic program

“This stadium will be one
of the finest in the country.
I think it will fit in with
the football prgoram we're
building here at Davidson.
several fine
football schools who didn't
want to schedule us before
on a hame dnd home basis
because of the game which
we would have played here,
have gotten back in con-
tact with me since the an-
nouncement.”’

Construction is scheduled
to begin on the gymnasium
this fall and work on the sta-
dium in the spring of 1971.
Quicklyme and Mortar of
Charlotte is the chief can-
tractor. The work on Johns-
ton Gym is slated for com-
pletion in early 1972 while
the Richardson work should
be finished several months
later,

Funds from both the Duke
Endowment and the Ford
Foundation will be applied
to the cost of the construc-
tion which was not, reveal-
ed at the announcement but
which has been estimated
in excess of 1.5 million dol-
lars.
