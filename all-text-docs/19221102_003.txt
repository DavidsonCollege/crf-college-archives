THE DAVIDSONIAN, NOVEMBER 2, 1922

Arithmetic
He was teaching her arithmetic,
He said it was his mission ;
He kissed her once, he kissed her
twice
And said, “Now that’s addition!”

He kissed her and she kissed him
Without an exclamation.

Then he told her with a grin,
“That was multiplication !”

So after adding smack on smacks
Till they were near distraction

She took just one kiss back and said,
“That’s what you call subtraction!”

Then pa appeared upon the scene
And shouted in derision
And _ kicked poor Bill three blocks
away
And said, “That is long division !”

The Lightning Bug

The lightning bug is brilliant
But he hasn’t much of a mind

He goes out in the darkness
With his headlight on behind.

An Hour of Trial

His arm was ’round my shoulders laid,
Ile pressed my. head against his
breast,
I sighed, but not a word was said,
I felt his heart beat through his vest.

His fingers warm upon my cheek
Still toward his eyes compelled my

face,
A MERRY DRAMA
In Many Acts and Numberless
Scenes
By Ibsen Shaw Milne.
Characters: ‘Mack’ Lennox, a

rather prominent senior; he prides
himself on the nobbiness of his ward-
robe; it is his private opinion that he is
a veritable lady-killer,

“Bill” Carroll, his room-mate and a
no less prominent junior; in matter of
dress, his taste is more conservative
and substantial; in regard to his love
affairs the old adage, “Still water runs

deep,” is applicable.

Mack—

So lovely and so proud—but “pride,”
you know

“Goeth——.’” ‘This shall my stricken
heart console ;

For oh, proud maiden, you'd not be'so
proud, :

If you knew that your stocking had a

hole!

say you, you are supposed to

laugh? ee

Bill—That so, didn't know a feller
was supposed to laugh unless there was
something to laugh at, and yet come to
think of it you are a laughable propo-
sition yourself, so reckon I'll laugh,
here—

Mack—Can yer comedy, oldtimer,
and consider this: Senior speaking is
just about a month off.

Bill—What of it, the world’s not
coming to an end then is it?

Mack—No, but Mary Belle is liable
to come down,

3ill—There you gv again, you’re the
sardines’ whiskers when it comes to the
ladies aren’t you? Sure you are—but
don’t figure on borrowing any of my
stuff, I give you fair warning, lay off
on pain—

Mack—Have a heart Bill, except
your shirts. | My stock is low and
I haven’t seen any lately, that suit my
fancy.

3ill—That being the case you must
have kept away from Charlotte lately
for Ed Mellothas the niftiest line I
have seen lately. Saw it when I was
down there Monday.

Mack—Rave on.

Bill—They’ve a line of English
broadcloths in white and tan from:one
of the smartest of the New York 1m-
porters that is an eyeopener. Looks
like silk and yet it wears almost as
well as oxford. There’s a secret that
the English weavers have that the
American’s can’t quite fathom.

Mack—Sounds interesting, will
have to look ’em up. How did their
ties look? .

Bill—Fifth Avenue says silks and
they have them. Honest they are the
best I’ve seen lately. Especially the
Italian grenadines, a special importa-
tion. On the q. t. Mack—New York
has given the boot t6 knits and I
reckon that we'll have to accept her
verdict.

Mack—Yea indeed, thou spakest a
parable.—(adv.)°.” a

(To be continued) c

I only felt—I could not speak
Fast fettered’ in that close embrace.

Pained, racked, so tired I fain would
tlee
His voice my futile etforts stilled,
“Oh, just a little patience, see!”
I rise, I smile, my front tooth’s
filled !

Fresh Finn—‘What will Wwe do?”

Monk Deaver—‘‘T’ll spin a coin. If

tails we go to the movie, and if it
stands on edge, we'll study.

“Mr. McLeod is the world flat or

“Neither.”

“What is it then?”

“Crooked.”

Water—It’s Use

Few of us have ever stopped to
seriously consider the uses and ‘ad-
vantages of water, while some of us,
in fact, scorn it entirely. Among the
latter classification are those who are
afraid of drowning and those who,
being warned by its decaying effect on
shoes, steadfastly refuse either exter-
mad or internal applications. In order

that, we may not despise it without

-

well-founded reasons, — an ardent
alumnus has compiled the following
data upon water:

According to Webster, water is a
fluid which descends from the clouds
in rain and which forms rivers, lakes,
seas, ete., but we may safely assume
that Mr. Webster would never term the
Rhine as being composed of water.
His definition is entirely inadequate,
inasmuch as he neglects to cite its
value, so we intend to list its principal
usages. Beyond a doubt its main use
at Davidson is in water on the knee, in
which it is an absolute requisite, Water
is also used to some extent in washing
but not at this college because you
can't get water where their ain't any
well. Certain races such as tramps
and anarchists are as yet aware of this
valuable advantage. It is also used
with great success by those who go to
Niagara Falls. Commercially, water is
of great value to bridge and lighthouse
manufacturers, life guards and gon-
doliers. Statistics show us that if Lake
Superior could be piped to Fades it
might easily be retailed at 10 cents per
glass, without war tax,

Further information on the subject
will be given to interested persons on
applying at the Headquarters of Water
Commission at the Pump House below
the Laundry,

Along about. this time we begin se-
lecting girls for Senior speaking, The
Peanut Parcher begs to add a little bit
of advise. The cardinal principal in
selecting the right girl is “pick one all
the other fellows will like but not
love.”

CAMPUS FOOTBALL IS
FAVORITE RECREATION

Dashing end runs, forward passes
that are uncanny and spectacular 70-
yard runs for touchdowns are being
pulled off right here in the heart of Da-
vidson, on the campus, nearly every
day and yet there are not so many
pigskin fans who see these, Fellows
gladly pay big prices to see football
games but yet right here on the campus
football games are played that are
guaranteed to furnish more thrills and
make more creepy feelings run up and
down one’s spine, per square minute
than a Harvard-Centre game.

And so campus football seems to
have come into its own again this year
at Davidson, after a relapse for the
past few years from the vaunted popu-
larity that it enjoyed in the years pre-
vious, and it is holding full sway every
afternoon on ‘the ideal field that the
campus furnishes,

Big-muscled young ‘Titans are seen
stalking out to take their places on the
opposing teams and once the game is
on it immediately becomes a knock-
down step-on affair and arms and legs
are seen to fly freely in all direction®.
The-easualties are beyond belief and
many a crippled fellow hobbling about
on crutches with™histeg in a cast and
arm in sling can testify tothe horrors
and death-dealing atrocities. that-are
committed in campus football.

The riyalry between the giant-like

intense and when one of the more ag-
gressive of these enters the fray thirst-
ing for bloody victory and, by a streak
of luck, emerges wearing the crown of
victory, an ovation is given him that
the one Bo McMillan received in his
own home town after romping on Har-
vard, hardly rivals.

1).

Virginia seems to have the biggest
collection of stellar teams this year.
With W. & L. and V. P. I. on the of-
fensive list and V. M. I. among the de-
fensive teams, and a strong team at the
University, the other States will have
to look hard to find four such elevens.
W. & L. and V. M. I. are still unde-
feated, but even at that it is not so sure
that they are the best of the bunch.
