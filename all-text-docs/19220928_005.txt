MINISTERIAL BAND
ENJOYS FIRST SPREAD
OF THE YEAR

Ask any member of the Ministerial Band
where he was the night of Saturday, Septem-
ber 23, and watch the grin that spreads over
his face. It won't be a half way grin; it'll
be an ear-to-ear smile that speaks of the
memory of sandwiches and dopes and cakes
and ice cream, not to speak of apples and
bananas,

If the grin on that chap’s face tells you he
was at the feed held over White's Drug
Store, it speaks the truth, for that was a
regular, sure-enough, _honest-to-goodness
feed, if ever one took place at old Davidson.

Some 40 members of the Ministerial Band
assembled at the Civic League Hall right
after the movies Saturday night for the pur-
pose of a good time-and a big feed. In
neither particular did they fail in their pur-
pose. Of course the eats came first, and
when everybody felt like a Ford tire with
90 pounds of air pressure, the speeches be-
gan.

Bill Baker, the president, had mercy on
the assembly and produced only one speaker
for the occasion. This was Buck Currie,
who, of course, made a cracking good talk,
and didn’t forget to cut it short.

After this the boys introduced themselves
to the crowd, each fellow giving his name
and home. The evening closed with a num-
ber of songs.

With Hiram Sharpe operating on the
piano, the crowd turned loose on the old
stand-by college Melodies with all the volume
of Carusos.

“College ‘Ties” and “O Davidson,” closed
the musical program, and after 15 for the
new members, the refreshment committee
and the president of the band, the mem-
bers disbanded and went to their bunks t:
dream of wash tubs .full of coca-cola and
mountains of ice cream.

MITCHELL AND SUMMERS
ARE MINISTERIAL
BAND TALKERS

Last Sunday proved to be an interesting
day for the ‘tembers of the Ministerial
Band at Davidson. A, M. Mitchell; of Union
Seminary, gave a short talk which was both
helpful and interesting. Mr. Mitchell grad-
uated from Davidson with the class of ’21,
and it was a source of genuine pleasure to
have him present on last Sunday,

The band was also glad to have another
of its former members present at the meet-
ing Sunday. A. C. Summers, of the class of
"22, gave a short talk on “Our Minds.”
Taking the four branches, the mind which
controls the physical features of our bodies,
the inner mind, the conscience, and the mind
for God, Gus told how each may be devel-
oped and strengthened,

In the business session which followed,
more definite plans were made in regard to
the work of the band for the year. Deputa-
tions will comprise the chief endeavor and in
order to carry out this part of the work, it
was decided to send a representative to the
meeting of the synod and make clear to the
ministers of the state the plans of the band.

WEEKS AND BURNEY
DELIVER TALKS AT
VOLUNTEER BAND

The Volunteer Band meeting last Sunday
morning was conducted by Guy E. Weeks.
The meeting was interesting and well at-
tended.

Leroy Burney gave an excellent talk in
which he set forth many reasons why the
new men as well as the old, should turn their
Marts to God at the beginning of the college
year.
lows probably have become inactive and stale
in the Christian religion, while others have
strengthened their faith in the Master. To
the former group, Burney directed espe-
cially, his talk.

He brought to good effect that one’s life
in college is a good example of one’s life in
the future. Therefore, the help of Jesus
Christ is essential to the success of any
career, both in college and out of college.
The only way to obtain this help is to turn
to God at the very start, for it is a true say-
ing, “Two-thirds of a race is finished in the
start.” :

NEW ANNEX TO CHURCH
WILL DO AWAY
WITH CONGESTION

Due to a much larger registration here
this term than ever before the seating in
church and chapel has become quite a prob-
lem. Most of the student body has been
squeezed into Shearer Hall in some manner,
hut it has proved impossible as well as im-
practicable to find the required seating space
in the church, The result has been that the
Senirs have been released from compulsory
morning attendance at church service and are
now allowed to take their choice of either
the morning or evening service at either the
Presbyterian or Methodist Church.

The annex to the church, which was be-
gun during the vacation months to relieve
the present emergency, has been delayed in
construction due to failure of materials to
arrive promptly. ‘This annex is on the
eastern side of the churéh where the pulpit
formerly was in past years. Within the
next few weeks it is hoped to complete this
and adequately provide the necessary seating
space for the entire student body and con-
gregation,

PANDEINIC SOCIETY
TAKES IN NEW MEMBERS

The Pandeinic Literary Society started
its second year with a rush last Thursday
night. There was much activity in the hall,
with fear and trembling on the part of some
12 Freshmen, who started off on their
literary career. Two upper classmen were
also initiated, pees in a more dignified man-
ner,

After their unusual greeting, the Fresh-
men engaged in various sports, while the
older men increased their enthusiasm in
many ways and by various. means. Begin-
ning with several rounds of one-armed box-
ing, the athletes gave way to the eaters, and
several cakes of shredded wheat disap-
peared with despatch.

That done, the debaters took the floor, and
Wallace Moore and Warren Cox blushed
and reddened as their younger brothers
brought out and enlarged upon their defects
of form and complexion, So heated was the
contest and so animated the participants that
the two specimens under discussion were at
one moment on the heights, as their defend-
ers brought out the many points in which
they resembled Apollo, then, at the next, in
the depths, as the opposition showed their
absolute lack of any claim to beauty.

Upon the completion of the activities, ré
freshments were served.

In Columbia, S. C., Thursday, June, 1,
Reverend Henry Benson Dendy, 19, was
united in marriage to Miss Nellie Spann
Marks, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. R.
Stuart Marks.

For. Men Only
The joke that too often goes best, in
theatre or club, or social circle, is the one

that shows up a wife to ridicule. It doesn’t
have to be a story about your wife. Any-
hody’s wife will do. So long as the story
mocks the judgment of a wife, or paints her
as second in intelligence only to one of pure
Darwinian ancestry, everybody seems satis-
fied and happy. So long as wives are the
subject, the lid is off. Nothing is too mean,
nothing is too cutting to be awarded a chorus
of approving male laughter and applause.
And right there is where the practising mem-
hers of the local husband’s union make a
great mistake. Leaving chivalry out of it,
putting love aside, a man who slurs his wife,
slurs himself most of all. In criticising her
he reflects criticism equally on his own re-
puted high standing judgment, his own
proudly enthroned good sense, in having se-
lected her as his wife. It is. a public ad-
vertisement of a private and personal failure.
And those who Iend encouragement and ap-
proval by laughter and applause are little
better off. By their tacit agreement they
admit, by their very callousness toward it,
how probable and casual a thing it is to their
minds. Speaking ill of one’s wife is not only
not nice, it is impolitic. No gentleman wou!d
do it. Others would do well to practise a
tikecestraint.

LITERARY NEWS

FRESHMEN RECEIVED |
BY EUMANEAN SOCIETY

Last Thursday evening about. 30 Fresh-
men presented themselves at the Eumanean
hall to be initiated and start their careers in
this famous old society. After being con-
ducted into the hall, as becomes all new men,
cheers of greeting went up from the old
men and the invitation exercises were on.
The first number on the program was a
debate by McNeir and Bouvier on the sub-
ject, “Resolved, That Freshmen Make Bet-
ter Bootleggers ‘Than Moonshiners.” From
the speeches it was evident that the debaters
had not given much thought to this weighty
question and were soon forced to take their
seats with the question still unsettled.

Williamson next entertained the audience
with a solo but fortunately it was very short
to the relief of both Williamson and the
audience. Brinson and Baker then gave an
exhibition of wrestling and egg frying,
which was very funny. But tlte funniest
part of the program, except for those direct-
ly concerned, was the shredded wheat eating
contest. Barr proved himself to be the
champion shredded wheat eater. The pro-
gram was concluded by short solos from
Martin and Cox,

The refreshments were next in order and
everyone, especially the Freshmen, seemed
to enjoy this feature of the entertainment.

METROPHILIANS INITIATE
NEW MEMBERS

At the of the  Metrophilian
Literary last Thursday evening
initiation ceremonies were held and 14 new
men were taken into the society.

The older members entered first and as
soon as they had become seated, the doors
were thrown open and those who were aspir-
ing to membership were admitted to the hall.
Their entrance was accompanied by much
laughter because of the ludicrous ways in
which they had dressed. To all of them, it
seemed, shoes were useless articles of dress
for instead of wearing them upon their feet,
as is the custom about here, they had them
festooned about their necks. Some seeming-
ly unaccustomed to the habiliments of civili-
zation, had donned their coats in the exact
opposite of the usual manner, doubtless to
exhibit the lining.

LIBRARY NEWS

During the summer months many new and
interesting books by popular authors have
been added to the Davidson College Library.
A brief summary of three of them is given
below: ‘

“The Pathless Trail” is a story of a man
who fled from civilization because he had
committed murder, and in a partially de-
mented state lived for five years with a tribe
of cannibals, they being afraid to kill a mad-
man, ‘This is a very romantic and exciting
hook by a great writer, Arthur Friel, who
his own trails. ‘The author is at

roving in the jungles of South

blazes
present
America.

“Lucretia Lombard” is the title given to a
very dramatic novel written by Kathleen
Norris, the wife of Charles G. Norris,
author of “Brass.” Mrs. Norris is a writer
of no mean ability. The story is of a Scotch
nobleman whom two ladies loved.

“Painted Windows” is a book that every
Davidson student should read. It was writ-
ten by the author of “The Mirrors of Down-
ing Street.” This book reveals the chaos of
opinion which exists in the modern church
and secks to discover a reason for the
present ignoble situation of the church in
the affections of men.

In addition to these there are four books
on wireless telegraphy and radio, three by

Elmer E. Broker and one by A. P. Morgan.
