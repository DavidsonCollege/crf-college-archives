Mysteries of Davidson salad bar are answered —

By BILL SCOUTEN and
CHIP SEIDEL
I have received a veritable
plethora of questions in the past
few weeks concerning the Com-
mons and its sphere of influence;

food and food _ preparation.

Today, however, I would like to
concentrate on one facet of the
Commons’ fare; the salad bar.

Is it true that we will have
eaten forty acres of lettuce by our
senior year?

No! After much discussion
with senior mathematics major
‘Bob Fish, biology enthusiast
Ellen Morrissey, and Farmer Bob,
it was decided that a one square
acre lettuce patch yields 260 heads
of lettuce if the weather cooper-
ates. If this number is multiplied
by forty, we receive a grand total
of 10,400 heads of lettuce. There-
fore, if the average student eats
one head of lettuce at every meal,
including breakfast, every day of
his life at Davidson, he will still
have consumed only one quarter
of the forty acres of leafy green.
S.A.L.A.D. (Students
Against Lettuce and Dressings)
brought to the attention of ‘the
spoof staff that little or nothing is

known about the content of the

salad dressings, especially what

lies on the bottom of the vats. Yes,
the dressings that you and I take
for common — the ones that may
be covered with croutons, or
which may have bacon _ bits,

hearty chunks of lettuce and ques-
tionable matter floating on the sur-
face. They demand to know the
truth. We, too, think that we
should get to the bottom of this.

An independent expert in the
field of liquid biophysics and high
viscosity mediums (and an
accomplished scuba _ diver),
agreed to study this matter further.
In fact, applying for a government
grant, he received $10,000 to con-
duct his study. The results were
conclusive.

After a preliminary micro-
analytical study of various dres-
sings (Italian, French, Russian,
and “house dressing,” the real
mystery), it was found that im-
purities were quite abundant. To
put this finding into perspective,
researchers at the Food and Drug
Administration informed me that
vegetables and meats are salable
even with impurities, provided
they pass under the “defect
levels.” For instance, asparagus

(either canned or frozen) may

have up to 10% of its spears in- _

fested with six asparagus beetle
eggs (either 40 thrips or 5 insects
in 100-gram samples); pepper can
average to be up to 1% insect in-
fested or mold by weight (or | mg
of excreta per pound)! Surprised?!
Just imagine what you could be

eating!
using the “hand plunge”
method of exploration, our

specialist found further evidence
of gross impurities — tangible
proof. Withdrawing his hand after
a masterful dive, he recovered a
handful of primordial “muck,” an
amorphous glob, which after
macro- and microanalysis seemed
to indicate the presence of rotten
lettuce, decomposed croutons,
cheese particles mangled beyond
recognition, various bits of other
vegetables and several serving

utensils. An anonymous Com-

mons worker commented, “I’ve
been a part of this dining estab-
lishment. I know what goes on at
the salad bar. . . and it’s not a
pretty sight. I remember once last
year when... .” The conversa-
tion ended abruptly as he suppres-
sed a wave of nausea: Bon appetit!

lowed up with a series of ques-
tions aimed to raise student aware-
ness about the condition of the
salad bar and the hard-working
salad bar monitor’s plight.
“Rabbit food” is being eaten
like it’s going out of style. The
past few weeks have seen salad
bins replaced often and lettuce
supply: depleted. Indeed, student
research has indicated that there
has been an increased consump-
tion of salad, which seems to be
due to the oracles of the guru John
David Ramsey —-an eccentric,

. modern day Amos — bringing

his message of doom and destruc-
tion to the Davidson campus.
Ramsey prophesied that diet-
ers and other salad eating folk
would suffer the wrath of a super-
fertile breed of rabbit for their
knowing lack of concern and utter
defilement of the salad bar, in ad-
dition to their unwillingness to eat
other questionable veggies being
served. The “bearer of bad tid-
ings,” in a closed interview with
spoof officials, stated that “his-
tory has a way of repeating itself.”
By refusing to acknowledge
the importance of vegetables in
our lives, defiling the salad bar by
our general messiness (dropping

cheese, lettuce, etc. into other

components of the salad bar), and
generally disregarding the distress
of the salad bar attendant who has
to clean up the mess (“purge the
salad bar of ‘impurities’”’), we are
bringing on a great calamity. He
prophesied that a- plague, much
like the Australian Rabbit Plague
of 1859, will find lettuce patches
nationwide overrun witha strain
of “‘super-rabbits,” a super-fertile,
super-prolific breed. John David
concluded the interview saying,
“The rabbits will overtake the let-
tuce fields)... No more Mr.
Nice Peter Rabbit.”

Take heed, tnen! Keep that
salad bar clean... . Watch
where that crouton falls, that
hearty chunk of cauliflower.
There is still time to repent, to re-
spect the salad bar. Never forget
the possibility of a rabbit
plague....

Davidson life, people, _ tradi-
