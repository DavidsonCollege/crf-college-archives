Basket Ball Season
Opens With Victory

Charlotte Y. M. C. A. An Easy Vic-
tim---The Schedule.

The 1917 basket ball season had a
most auspicious opening on last Saturday
night when the Red and Black five were
victorious over the team representing the
Charlotte Y. M. C. A., by a score of
60 to 22.

The game was staged at the local Y.
M. C. A, and a large audience was pres
ent, completely filling the area around
the court on the ground floor, and also
the galleries.

The game, despite the one-sidedness
of the score, was fast and interesting
thruout and the Davidson team showed
up to especially good advantage, consid-
ering the brief period of the pre-season
practice. The whole team was work-
ing in good form and the student body
is much encouraged as to the prospects
for a great season to come.

“AL” Reese, playing a running-guard.
played one of the fastest and smoothes‘
games ever seen on the local floor.
throwing 11 field goals and two foul
goals for the highest individual score of
the evening. Cantain Hengeveld ware
a close second to Reese in the matter of
scoring. and his plaving was both steady
and spectacular. King at forward plav-
ed his usual fast and snappy game, an?
he got awav with a large number of ficl'
goals. Walker at guard was the main
stay on the defensive. his plaving beine
hard and steady. The passing of th
team as a whole was not as smooth a
could be wished. but this requiremen’
will undoubtably be met before mans
davs of nractice have nacsed.

The Y. M. C. A. showing good ma-
terial, were not at their best by anv
means. Davenport at center was the
outstanding star for his team and his
playing was of the highest order.

Howell, at forward, also played a
good game, shooting three field goals.
