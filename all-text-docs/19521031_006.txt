Adlai because he sticks to what
he says in his speeches.”

Harry Hickey: “Ike is my man.
A change in administration will
help end corruption in the gov-
ernment.”

Paul Alexander: “Personally 1
like Adlai, but I’m dissatisfied with
the Democratic party, so I'm voting
for Ike.”

Mitchell Patton: “I am dissatis-[

fied with Truman‘ and feel that
a change is in order. Ike is the
man so far as I’m concerned; his
war experience will be an aid to
him in politics.”

Bob Wearn: “I'll be glad to see
the mess in Washington cleaned
up. Ike is the man to keep Harry
out of the deep freezer business.”

Igor Sviatoslavsky: “I’m for Ike;
America needs a change.”

Tom Tennet: “I cast my vote for
Adlai. Ike has a good foreign pol-
icy, but Adlai has a stronger do-
mestic policy.”

Blake Brinkerhoff: “I like Ike
because he uses everyday language
that I can understand, Adlai uses
stuffy language.”

game and has been out for four
weeks will be back in the offen-
sive lineup, but not in his old full-
back slot. Brown. will operate from
right half while Leroy Fargason
will continue in the fullback role
he assumed when Brown was hurt.

Captain Arnold Whisnant’s leg
injury, suffered in the Furman
game, has, proved not to be as seri-
ous as it was first feared, and he
too may be back in playing shape
against Harvard.

Davidson appears to be going
into tomorrow's game ‘in better
physical shape, with the possible
exception of Whisnant, than at
any other time this year.

Harvard, however, has a heavier
and deeper squad, and the experts
will probably be unable to see any-
thing but a fifth defeat in the cards
for the Davidson Wildcats.

Since we are representing Great
Britain, we should present both
sides.”

Concerning British politics, the
consensus was that the British wel-
fare state needs ‘more . efficiency,
but in general it works well, and
not even the conservatives have
taken any thing away; instead they
have increased benefits. Dibben,
however, said, “Thinking ‘conser-
vatives are beginning to think of
drawing a line.” Both agreed that
Prime Minister Winston Church-
ill’s popularity had declined since
the war.

On American politics, Evans said
that the “British attitude is that
whoever is elected President will
present about the same foreign
policy. Corruption in government
seems to be thought of as inher-
ent in politics over here, despite
an almost reverent attitude for
political offices.” Dibben said, “At
home we would respect their in-
tegrity despite their competence.
You criticize them severely here;
we would be quiet.”

With trumpets sounding and
symbols clashings, the 57 members
of the Football Band, under the
direction of Mr. Kenneth Moore,
marches onto the field to enter-
tain the fans at halftime.

The traditional band of David-
son College has again begun it's
full year of activities. A football
game wouldn't be the same with-
out a band to thrill the spectators
to its clever marches and precision
manuevers, but have you ever
stopped to think who works out
these well organized routines?

-George Brinkley and Alden
Williams constitute the idea com-
mittee, which creates many of the
ideas that Mr. Moore puts into
reality. Each routine seen on the
field has been carefully charted and
each band member knows exactly
what his position is after studying
the chart.

The band spends approximately
fifteen minutes studying this chart
while the rest of their time is de-
voted to getting the music sound-
ing right and the actual routine
on the field. Showmanship with
the Davidson Band is secondary,
because they concentrate on the
quality of their music.

Bob Beal, drum major, is re-
sponsible for @any signals, but a
majority of the signals are automa-
tic and depends upon the individ.
val to carry them out. This was
evident in the clock and pendulum
routine, which was presented at
one of the earlier games.

The band will entertain the stu-
dents at Coker College in Harts-
ville, S. C., on its way to Charles-
ton, S. C., where it will play for
the Davidson-Citadel game on No-

Jack Ruth investigated the prob-
lem.

Vance Mizelle brought cheers
from the student body when
he stated that the college was
against our traveling on Sun-
day, but that many of our
parents did not want us travel-
ing on the first.

Dave Moylan questioned the
philosophy of the system of double
cuts, saying that he doubted the
validity of a system in which stu.
dents were given freedom from
classes and then tol) when to take
it.

President Ruth said after the
meeting that the change in scoring
the cuts, though not the most sat-
isfactory solution, will represent
a much better arrangement than
the present one.

French Club

Has Meeting
To Begin Year

Le Cercle Francais, an honorary
fraternity which recognizes out-
standing French students in their
third year or in advance courses,
held its first meeting Tuesday night
at the home of Professor Watts.

Mac Bulgin, president, called the
meeting to order and Moody Smith,
secretary read the minutes and
called the roll, to which had been
added 12 new members.

After a short business meeting,
the members were provided entér-
tainment, which included resumes
read in French by Bill Gordon and
Gregory Dimijian. A skit, “Le Sau-
vage et Le Missionaire,” was then
presented by MM. Vance Miczelle,
Eddie Powe, and David Jones.
After the skit, Herman Bell gave
a discussion on his experiences in
France this summer. He spoke at
length on life in Touraine, French
cooking, French education and
French. culture. ,

The meeting was concluded by
singing of French: songs, after
which the members carried on

French conversations while enjoy-|

ing refreshments served by Ma-
dames Watts and Goldiere.

Le Cercle Francais holds month-
ly meetings which usually consist
of skits, plays, readings, and games
and other forms of. entertainment.
Le Cercle usually holds a joint
necting with French students
from another school; this year’s
pli.ns call for a meeting with the
Queens College students.

Le Cercle usually holds its last
meeting at a dinner held in the

nauseating to listen to a man ex-

Frosh Black List

Only three fteshmen charged
with serious offenses appeared be-
fore the Court of Control this
week, .

No meeting of the Court was
held in chapel due to the’ Home-
coming program at that time.

One aspect of the Court which
is often misunderstood or unknown
completely to most students is that
of the Court’s pardoning functions.

Several times in the course of
the Monday night meetings, fresh-
men are tried and acquitted. These
mens’ names do not appear in this
column, primarily because of its
derogatory nature, but they none-
theless form a major part of the

Courts program.

Darrel Floyd, found guilty of
not wearing a cap and not speaking
to upper-classmen, was ordered to
wear a ribbon on his cap and to
serve as stud boy for a senior.

Denis King was directed to wear
a large sign bearing his name for
failing to wear a name plate.

Tom Owens was convicted of
being without a cap and was or-
dered to wear a ribbon and serve
as stud boy.

Other freshmen came before the
Court in order to take a re-exam-
ination on the Freshmen Regula-

Affected by Smoking Chesterfields

~e

Aresponsible consulting organization has
reported the results of a continuing study by a

competent medical specialist and his staff on the

effects of smoking Chesterfield cigarettes.

A group of people from various walks of life
was organized to smoke only Chesterfields. For six
months this group of men and women smoked their

normal amount of Chesterfields— 10 to 40 a day.
45% of the group have smoked Chesterfields con-
tinually from one to thirty years for an average of

\ 10 years each.
