Composting program

continues to expand

BRENNA KELLY
Staff Writer

If you’ve been to the Union
lately, you will have noticed the
array of additional trashcans sur-
rounding the café level. These new
receptacles are not to be mistaken
as extra space for your everyday
trash, however. They are part of
the Davidson Composting Proj-
ect, a program that began last year
when Davidson purchased a “Green
Drum” commercial composter and
built an on-site compost facility.

“The project was inspired by a
class on food and culture taught by
Fuji Lozada in the spring of 2008,”
said Galen King ’10, one of the stu-
dents involved with the project.

“The class had a service learn-
ing component where students were
divided into groups and worked
for half of the semester on differ-
ent projects,” Katie Epstein °10
said. “One of these groups worked
with Dee Phillips [Director of Din-
ing Services] to develop a plan for
composting.”

The primary students in this
Anthropology 267—Food and Cu-
lure class who were involved in
initiating the composting project at
Davidson, were Minh Nguyen ’09,
Alicyn Isaaclowry ’08, Alex Gregor
09, Chris Beeston ’08, Josh Ham-
let ’10 and Karen Hasty, ’10.

So, what is composting?

To put it simply, composting
is the blending of certain organic
wastes, such as food or yard waste,
to form compost, which is an or-

ganic material that is used as a
means to improve soil and cultivate
plants — essentially, fertilizer.

The goal for composting at Da-
vidson is to reduce the amount of
organic waste on campus (mostly
food) that the college ultimately
has to put in landfills. By combin-
ing wastes and converting them
into a fertilizer, pollution and ex-
cess waste are reduced, and Physi-
cal Plant has a new environmental
way to fertilize the grounds of Da-
vidson.

“It’s recycling in the most ac-
curate sense of the word,” Epstein
said. “It’s a complete circle, which
is more than you can usually say
for plastic bottles and cans. Plus,
the college needs to buy compost
every year to maintain the grounds.
With our new composter, the col-
lege is saving money by creating
the compost it would otherwise
have to outsource.”

Although Davidson only started
this composting program mid-way
through last semester, the campus
has already seen positive results.
“So far the composter has been
hugely successful,” Epstein said.

The number of garbage truck
pickups on campus has already de-
creased from three times a week to
two, and Commons’ dumpster trash
has been reduced by over half.
Presently, only Commons and the
Union are contributing to the com-
poster due to the amount of waste
the composter can process.

However, King assures students
that “there are pilot programs in

motion that will access the poten-
tial of other places on campus be-
ing a part of composting as well.”

Common items suitable for
composting include cardboard
rolls, paper, dryer and vacuum
cleaner lint, coffee grounds and
filters, eggshells, houseplants and
teabags.

clude utensils, napkins, cups and
plates. Many of these items are
made of com starch, which adds
to the sustainability aspect of the
Union’s programs.

“It’s a credit to Davidson stu-
dents and their desire to create pos-
itive change that this composter is
here today,” Epstein said.

Roosevelt Institute brings think-tank to campus

Student researchers who want
to contribute their talents to ben-
efit the community through service
now have the opportunity to do so.
This year, Davidson welcomes its
chapter of The Roosevelt Institu-
tion, a non-profit, non-partisan na-
tional student think-tank based in
Washington D.C.

The organization was founded
five years ago and boasts chapters at
nearly 80 colleges and universities
around the country. Members carry
out policy research on important
regional and local political issues,
including defense and diplomacy,
energy and environment, economic
development, health care, equal
justice and education.

Nick Camey °11 and Matt De
Niear ’11 started Davidson’s chap-
ter last semester, but because both
are abroad this semester, John

Morgan °12 and co-president Iain
Addleton °12 are now responsible’
for the organization.

Davidson’s chapter of The
Roosevelt Institution is chartered
under United Community Action
(UCA) because of its focus on ser-
vice and local community issues.

“Davidson is already an incred-
ibly active campus, a national lead-
er in community service and activ-
ism,” Morgan said. “What we hope
to do is fill a void in student ideas
behind all that service, where we
take ownership of our projects in
the community with our own pro-_
posals. There’s so much energy on
this campus and in this community
as a whole that I anticipate a truly
integrated effort from Roosevelt
here.”

“We can pool together so many
talents, combining both the academ-
ic and service-oriented resources at
Davidson,” Morgan continued. “In
the larger area, I look forward to

the opportunity for working with
leaders and policy makers to bend
regional initiatives in a progressive
light.”

Why not just let the profession-
als do this? “Davidson kids, for
one, provide a unique perspective
to community issues here, since
we come from so many differ-
ent backgrounds,” Morgan said.
“We've all seen different ways of
doing things at a community level.
When it comes to writing tomes of
legislation, let the folks do it who
get paid for it. When it comes to lo-
cal, service-oriented policy, we can
find a special niche. We can get on
the ground and connect with folks
in ways the paid professionals in
Washington, or in Charlotte, can’t
quite do the same.”

Throughout this first semester,
the chapter hopes to establish a
presence on campus and “build re-
lationships with community leaders
and organizations,” Morgan said.

“Ideally, we'd like to get through
at least one policy memo that cen-
ters on Davidson’s involvement
with the community — maybe even
something that’s already going on
with student groups.”

At the Roosevelt Institution’s
first meeting last week, student
leaders emphasized that because
this is the chapter’s first year on
campus, members will have the op-
portunity to decide the direction of
the organization and make a strong
impact.

The chapter’s organizational
structure is concentric, meaning
that a core group of members will
pick one issue to focus on and then
branch out into the community to
involve people at varying degrees
through event planning, research,
writing policy briefs or activism.

ting involved or reading more
