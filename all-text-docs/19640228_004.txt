THE DAVIDSONIAN

Side Lights

BY RICK LOWERY

BLINDMAN‘S BLUFF...

Last night the season began for eight teams in the
Southern Conference. Tonight, it continues for only four
and tomorrow it will end for all but one.

To be quite honest, this column was written Wed-
nesday night; by now it could be quite old news. But so
many, many words have been written of the coming tour-
nament that I thought it would be interesting to put my
foot in my mouth two days ahead of time.

So the following few lines are my predictions of the

outcome of this tournament.

I have always felt that the most important single
aspect of basketball is rebounding. To win consistently a
team must get more rebounds than its opponent. In fact,
there’s probably a certain spread in the rebound totals
that guarantees a winning team.

In a short tournament. many factors enter into con-
sideration—measles, youth, even just a bad night. But the
team that will overcome these factors is the team that
wins off the boards, and that team is not necessarily the
tallest. For rebounding is about 60% desire or instinct
or something not so tangible as height—measured in feet
and inches.

That’s the thing I first look for at the start of a
basketball game and before this. tournament ends, re-
bounding will decide the champion.

Thursday afternoon Davidson will beat The Citadel
and VMI will nip Furman. Thursday night West Virginia
will overwhelm William and Mary behind the aggressive
play of any of about eight men but particularly senior
Tom Lowry. In the second game the tournament’s major
upset will occur as George Washington tops VPI.

Friday night Davidson will beat VMI for the third
time this season and West Virginia will have a surprising-
ly easy win over George Washington.

Saturday will. provide a replay of last year’s final
game. In last year’s game, the team that wanted to win
the title won. This year’s title wil! again be decided by
the mental attitude of the two teams. For upon this at-
titude will depend the outcome of the battle for the

Davidson College will win its first Southern Confer-
ence basketball championship ever this year only because
they want to win it.

Well, by this time I imagine the above has already
rovided a horse laugh or two but that’s how I see it,
ednesday night.

OUR FATHERS’ TIME FLEETINGLY...

So the days of George Gipp are gone?

Tuesday night Cassius Clay knocked out Sonny Lis-
ton in Miami.

Monday night, the University of Virginia beat the
University of North Carolina in Charlottesville.

The significance of the first victory is obvious but
the second requires some explanation. Monday night was
Chip Conner night in Charlottesville but Chip Conner
was not there.

Conner is the anemic-looking forward who for three
years has been the backbone of the Cavalier attack.
Earlier this year, Conner led Virginia in what was very
nearly an upset over Davidson in the Charlotte Coliseum.

___ He possesses all of the basic shots, plus a great hang-
ing drive, and has been a great competitor. Monday, the
University was to present him with a trophy in apprecia-
tion of his career performance.

Chip Conner did not accept this trophy. His parents
received it for him; Conner had been sidelined with emer-
gency surgery earlier in the day. And so the “Connerless
Cavaliers” tackled North Carolina.

Coach Bob Gibson related that Virginia decided to
win one for Chip. And in that land of sophistication where
the campus is the “grounds” and a gentleman wears a
tie—the unsophistication of another year returned. brief-
ly and Virginia soundly thrashed North Carolina . . . for
Chip.

THE ALL-STAR TEAM

This week the Southern Conference all star team
was announced. Davidson placed all five starters on this
list of the outstanding players in the conference. ;

Fred Hetzel was unanimously elected to the first

team for the second consecutive year. Terry Holland and |

Dick Snyder were named on the second team, while Don
Davidson and Barry Teague were named honorable men-
tion. In the history of the Southern Conference no team
has achieved such an honor.

In addition to Hetzel, the first team was made up
of Howard Pardue from VPI,: Bill Blair of VMI, Tom
Lowry of West Virginia, Joe Adamitis from George Wash-
ington and John Telepo of Richmond. No doubt, these
five ball players have all the credentials to back up their
selection but just for a moment, I'd like to take my hand
at picking an All-Southern Conference team. |

The difference between the selection process of
these two teams will be that I will exclude all Davidson
players and consider only those players who have played
against Davidson this year.

This will of course eliminate George Washington
and VPI from any consideration but this is only one man’s
opinion. a

At center I would pick Tom Lowry. Although Lowry
was less than sensational in Charlotte, his performance in
Charleston was the best pivot performance of the season
with the exception of Jay Buckley.

The two forwards on my team would be Martin Mor-
ris of William and Mary who simply could not miss in
Norfolk, and John Telepo who played two fine games
against Davidson.

Bill Blair was very cold and very hot against David-
son, but on the basis of his performance in little old
Johnston Gym, he’s one guard.

The other guard, I pick as captain of the team. He is

Wildcats Probably Reface Princeton
If Survive Tournament Maelstrom

BY JOHNNY CLARK

Assuming Wildcat victories in the Southern Conference Tournament tonight and tomorrow night, a rematch
with the Bill Bradley-led Princeton Tigers looms as 2 likelihood for the Davidson cagers in the Eastern Regional

Tournament.

Philadelphia hosts the first
round of the tourney, March 9, in
which the Southern Conference
champion will meet the winner
of the Ivy League crown. Prince-
ton, which was clobbered 102-68
by the Wildcats in the finals of
the Charlotte Invitational earlier
this season, is presently the
front-runner among the  Ivies,
who decide their championship
by regular season play.

Other games in the -City of
Brotherly Love will match two
independents, Villanova and Pro-
vidence. and will pit Middle At.
lantic Conference Champion
Temple against the champion of
the Yankee Conference.

Villanova, which also brings a
team of Wildcats into the tourna-
ment, is ranked eighth in the
nation, a notch behind Davidson,
and is a strong favorite to de-
feat the Friars of Providence,
champions of last year’s Nation-
al Invitational Tournament.
Home standing Temple is like-
wise a favorite to eliminate the
eventual champion of the Yan-
kee Conference. which will prob-
ably be Connecticut. .

Philadelphia’s three winners
will join the Atlantic Coast
Conference champ in Raleigh,
March 13 and 14, for the finat
two rounds of the Eastern Re-
glonals. The ACC representa-
tive has a bye in the first
round by virtue of the confer-
ence’s success. in previous
tournaments.

mects the Cadets of VMI in a
game to decide who plays in the
finals Saturday night against the

ites. All Conference team cap
tain Fred Hetzel dumped in 13
points in the first 7 minutes and
Don Davidson ripped apart The
Citadel zone with his driving.

Davidson, playing one of the
best games of his college career,
finished the game with 22 points,
second only to Hetzel’s 24. Hetzel
also led both teams in rebound-
ing, clearing 16 as the ‘Cats out-
rebounded The Citadel 50-32.

Davidson also improved on its
nation-leading field goal percent-
age with a game mark of 58.3
per cent as team captain Terry
Holland hit 7 of 8 shots from the
floor to improve his 62.1 per cent
season’s record. Holland finisb-
ed the game with 17 points, fol-
lowed by Teague with 10 and
Marcan with 9.

Davidson and Snyder both
fouled out, as @id McCurdy,
Hartley, and Martini of The
Citadel.

George Washington got top
performance from everyone also
to pull off the upset of the first
round play. beating third place
VPI 64-62 in a real thriller. The
Colonials took an early lead be-
hind the rebounding and scoring:
ef center Joe Adamitis and led
at the half 35-30. In the second
period. Howard Pardue moved
inside and led the Gobblers back
into the lead. The lead see-sawed
in the last few minutes.

Pardue put the Gobblers ahead
60-59 on a three point play with
three minutes left. Seconda
later, the favorites gained pos-
session, but Mark Clark stole
the ball and turned a three point
play for the Colonials. Clark put
in two foul shots with 26 seconds
left to sew up the game for his
Colonials.

Adamitis led George Washing-

ton scoring with 19 points, and
pulled down 19 rebounds, VPI's
Howard Pardue managed 2
points, but shot a horrible 8 for
25 from the floor. No other VPI
player scored in double figures.

In upsetting the Gobbiers,
George Washington brought? to
the minds of many Davidson
and West Virginia fans haunt-
ing thoughts of the fateful 1961
tournament in which the Co-
lonials, ranked seventh in regu-
far season play, got behind the
whtte-hof shooting of Jon Fetd-
man for three stunning upsets
and the fournament champion-

ship.

VMI had ao tougher time in
downing a height starved Fur-
man team 77-73. Down 21
poinfs early in the second
Ralf, Furman pulted to with-
in three points at 71-49 with
9:50 left. The Paladins coutd-
wt quite make up for the huge
rebound deficit with their
height and fell beck in the
closing seconds. Bill Blair ted
the winners with 22 points;
kerey Peacock paced the Pale-
dins with 25.

In the West Virginia-William
and Mary game height again
played an important part, as the
taller, stronger Mountaineers
simpty overpowered the Indians
85-73. The Mountaineers guard,
Ricky Wray, and Buddy Quer-
tenmont pumped in enough from
the outside, and big men, Bob
Camp and Tom Lowry, stuffed
in enough inside to keep the
helpless Indians at bay. Only top
performances by William and
Mary's Martin Morris (22
points} and Dave Hunter (14
points) made the game interest-
ing.
