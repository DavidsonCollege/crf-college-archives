We Asked One Question“of 200 Men and Women
‘Which Pen is Your Choice for SGL and Beatty 7”

And 2 to 1 Selected Parker’s Laminated Pearl*

—The sacless Vacumatic with
Ever-Visible Ink Supply and
102% More Ink Capacity than
Old Style — GUARANTEED
Mechanically Perfect

Yes, Other things being equal,
style-minded people would choose the
Parker Vacumatic for beauty alone!
But other things, too, including per-
formance, make this revolutionary in-
vention the national favorite by a
still bigger margin—by 9 to 4.**

One important difference—its ink
supply is ever visible—the ENTIRE
length of the barrel. Thus it shows
days ahead WHEN IT’S RUNNING
LOW.

Another great difference is the pat-
ented Parker filler. There's no other
like it. It requires no sliding piston
immersed in ink—its working parts
are sealed in the top WHERE INK
CAN NEVER TOUCH THEM—
can never decompose them.

The Parker point is Scratch-proof
—precious Platinum combined with
solid Gold.

Every student needs this miracle
writer that doesn’t “let you down” by
running dry in classes or exams.

Go and see this luminous, lami-
nated Pearl Beauty at any good store
selling pens. ‘The Parker Pen Co.,
Janesville, Wis.
