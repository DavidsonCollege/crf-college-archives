SCHOLARSHIP SOCIETY
FORMED AT DAVIDSON

During Commencement week of 1915
the Mimir Society was organized by
several members of the faculty and of
the class of 1915. The object of the
society, according to the constitution, is
the promotion of scholarship among the
students of Davidson College. From
the men with the highest rank in scholar-
ship in the Junior and Senior classes
several will be elected at each commence-
ment.

The rules governing election to mem-
bership are as follows:

1. The members of this society shall
be chosen primarily from the members
of the graduating class of Davidson Col-
lege. Students of the academic depart-
ment who fulfill the following require-
ments are eligible for membership:
Those who have made an average grade
for three consecutive years of at least 93
per cent; these must have done three-
fourths of the work required for a de-
gree in resident work at Davidson Col-
lege, but credit gained by examination
will be counted; all non-elective work
must have been completed.

2. No man who has received a grade
of less than ten noints above the passing
grade in any college course, or who has
failed on a term’s work in any course
shall be eligible for membership.

3. The total number elected from
each class shall not exceed 15 per cent of
the members graduated in that class.

4. Members shall be elected at the
cloce of their Tunior or Senior years.

Although the society is a local organi- |
vation. steps are being taken to affiliate |-
