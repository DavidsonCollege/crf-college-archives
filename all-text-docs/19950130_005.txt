SGA fights cam

By Mary Laura Moretz

Students frustrated by long
lines at the library photocopying
machines now have reason to hope
for relief. Last week, the SGA
passed a resolution supporting the
purchase of at least one other ma-
chine for the library.

Like many ofher peers, sopho-
more Maggie Slocum feels that the
“big lines area hassle, especially at
the end of the year when every-
body has papers and projects.”
Occasionally, students make it to
the copiers only to find they are out
of service.

Senior SGA senator Chad
Lloyd drafted a letter to Library
Director Dr. Leland M. Park on
behalf of the SGA requesting “im-
mediate progress” in the acquisi-
tion of additional equipment.

Even one new machine, says
Lloyd, “would help substantially.

job of student care, the declaration
calls for a full-time doctor, more
personal and confidential treat-
ment, and fully-trained doctor’s
assistants.

In the meeting, several mem-
bers of the SGA related their expe-
riences with the health facility, and
there was a general call for more
specific information in the decla-
ration in order to support the gen-
eral claims more fully. It was
finally agreed that all interested
members of the SGA should talk to
Rudell in order to revise the decla-
ration, which will be presented at
this week’s meeting.

Rudell hopes that the declara-
tion will be finished so that he and
the SGA can present it to David
Staton, Dean Shandley, and the
trustees. Rudell also mentioned
that the declaration could lead to a
school-wide study of the health
facility.

Student Health Center Direc-
tor Dr. David Staton is awaiting
the proposal “with considerable
interest.” Although he has not
personally heard very many com-
plaints about the facility’s services,
he is “very interested in any sug-
gestions.” Staton explained that
he is “on common ground” with
anyone who wants to see the facil-
ity “be the best it can be” and has a
strong interest in improving any
areas of dissatisfaction to the de-
gree that resources allow.

Staton added that after speak-
ing to a group of students includ-
ing Rudell last semester, he posted
his own signs around campus in-
viting any input — positive ornega-
tive — on student health services.
Up until now, however, he has
gotten little response, but remains
“eager to hear any comment.”

The revised proposal will be
submitted to the SGA Tuesday.

If that turns out not to be enough, I
guess we'd get to work on getting
even more.” Lloyd also says the
SGA “would like to see the price
per copy go down to 3 cents.”

Park says the prices in the
library are already “considerably
lower than those at most colleges
and places in the area.” As for
obtaining a new machine, he says,
“We're certainly looking into it.
We have to collect data first on
prices and figure out the best loca-
tion for new equipment.”

The main delay will be “a bud-
get issue,” he says. “We have to
determine whether or not adding a
new machine will be cost efficient.
Since it would not be a funded
item, it has to support itself.”

In the search for the right
copier to buy, Lloyd hopes it will
be possible to implement a
“flexicard” system like the one he

took advantage of in his studies at
the London School of Economics.
The machines there were equipped
with a device that allows the user
to put money onto acard — similar

to the European “phonecard” —
whichcan be used to pay forcopies
until its amount runs out.
Whether or not such a system
could work at Davidson and even

when a new copier might arrive
still remain indefinite. “It’s not all
for the SGA todecide,” Lloyd says,
“but we’ ve at least established that
there is student demand.”
