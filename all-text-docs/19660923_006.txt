THE JOLLY GREEN GIANTS

While everyone is still in ecstasy about the chopping
down of George Washington by our heroes, another group
of footballers quietly goes about its tasks of making Da-
vidson a power in the Southern Conference in the years
to come. ;

1 am referring to the Wildkittens, who are anything
but that this year. This freshman team is the largest for
Davidson in many years and its potential is unlimited in
keeping Davidson on the winning track for the next sev-
eral years. ;

Coach Homer Smth calls his freshman football play-
ers “some of the outstanding young men of the South
and says, “We are as proud of them as we can be.”

For Davidson this is the first actual recruiting year| .

in the last four. The classes of 1967, '68 and ’69 all were
either drawn to Davidson with only token persuading or
by a late-arriving New Look coaching staff last year.

The primary task of Bobby Brown and Dick Short
this year is to find the 'Cats a quarterback for next year’s
first game. Whether it was intended or not, there are
seven freshmen who played quarterback in high school,
and all but one of these has experience at other positions
if they fail to get the signal-callling job next year.

This year’s freshman footballers are bigger than any
recent frosh squad before them. Every tackle and center
this year weighs over 200 pounds and the guards and
ends are not far from reaching that level themselves.

Ends like Mike Kelly and Terry Esterkamp will.give
the ’Cats big terminals next year either on offense or de-
fense. Tackles like huge Gary Hemric and Don Brown,
Joe Carr and Dave Thompson plus sophomores Jeff
Pflugner, Hank Strickland and Sandy Brenneman should
give the ’Cats a wealth of big men we have always
been short on.

With 11 running and defensive backs on the frosh
roster, plus the potential of Kerry Keith, Mike Thornton
and Greg Cox, Davidson should be deep and strong in
the backfield for years. ;

The freshman team will tackle its toughest slate in
many years, beginning in two weeks when it meets
Duke followed by games with North Carolina State, Fur-
man, Gardner-Webb and CMA. Smith says Davidson
scheduled the Blue Devils because “we thought the boys
would like to play Duke and we want to play teams that
Davidson should be playing.” .

The problem of several sophomores passing up foot-
ball after they did well last year presents the question
who can help Davidson next year. Smith says, “Everyone
who wants to help can play. Some of the least-likely play-
ers have become important in our plans.” An example of
this is the development of Johnny Slaughter as a varsity
interior lineman after many people felt he was too smail
to aid the cause.

Just being the best freshman team at Davidson in
several years does not mean we can start ordering bowl
tickets. The quality.and numbers of our players must
compare with the best in the league if we are to do well
in the future. This year we beat West Virginia in size
and have as many prospects as they do.

West Virginia missed out on a number of recruits be-
cause of the coaching turnover last winter. The junior
Mounties have 32 players compared with our 34. They
have only six 200-pound or plus linemen. We have eight.
Most of their boys are from West Virginia and Pennsyl-
vania. while ours are from throughout the South.

This comparison on paper is meaningless unless vou
consider the established reputation of West Virginia
against the building of Davidson to prominence in the
conference and region. If we continue to attract the good
high school student with above average athletic ability
’ and superior desire. we should have a team that will be
a credit to the school and to an athletic program here
which is attempting to make a little go a long wav.

Probably the best thing that could have happened
to Davidson was the GW win which gave the freshmen
the taste of winning from the start. Football has come of
age at Davidson and promises to give us something else
of which to be proud.

JUST MAKING SURE

Davidson had 12 men on the field at least once on a

punt return Saturday. Coach Smith said, “I'd sure rather

have 12 on the field than 10.” He said most 12-men-on-

the-field situations are discovered ‘when one of the play-

ers can’t find anywhere to line up in the formation.”
s

Davidson's foe tomorrow night, Furman, lost to Par-|

sons College, 20-6, last Saturday night. For those of you

who are not acquainted with Parsons, it is not the David-),

son of the Midwest as its name might imply. The name
given by its students and Life is “Flunkout U.” With the
reputation that goes with the title, Parsons is bound to
appeal to the strong, silent types as its 8-1 record of last
year indicates. Just goes to show, as Davidson’s all-time
record indicates, football games are not won in the class-
room.

*Cats To Face Furman Jomorrow

After Upsetting GW Saturday, 13-9

By OANNY WHITE
Sports Writer

The Davidson Wildcats will
clash with the Furman Purple
Paladins at 8 p.m. tomorrow
night at Memorial Stadium in
Charlotte in the 37th meeting
in a series dating back to 1902.

“Furman is the closest thing
to a traditional rival that Da-
vidson has,"' Coach Homer Smith
said. ‘‘We know that Davidson
is Furman’s big game, but we
look at it as just another game
in which we must play as well
as we can if we are to win.”

Although Davidson has blank-
ed the Paladins in the last two
encounters, Furman still holds
a 25-11 lead in the overall se-
ries. Before the last two games,
Furman had beaten the ‘Cats 13
straight times.

“The Paladins are an explo-
sive team and they are much
improved over last year,"’ Smith
said. ‘We caught them at a low
ebb last year when their quar-
terback was hurt. This year,

Kilgo Forsakes Paper
To Become ’Cat SID

By YATES FAISON
Assistant Sports Editor

Stepping from the hurried and deadline-filled confines of the newspaper world at
The Charlotte News, John Kilgo has found himself surrounded by an entirely new
system of variables in his capacity as Davidson’s newly-created sports information

irector.

“I still consider myself a
newspaper man," said Kilgo,
“and never, never will I be a
public relations man. I feel that
in this job I can present news-
paper men with legitimate items
to write about—not sell them a
bill of goods.” ‘

The ultimate reason for his
acceptance of the post, Kilgo
said, is the challenge it presents,
“although I think about it at
night.”

“Probably the. biggest rea-
son,"’ Kilgo said, ‘is my great
admiration of Davidson as .an
academic institution and the
great man, Grier Martin, at the
helm of the ship.”

Kilgo listed his friendship with
Coach ‘‘Lefty’’ Driesell over the
past several years as a key fac-
tor. “I have a great respect for
him,. and he’s awfully good for
Davidson. He should be dis-
played as the gentleman he is.

POOLE ELUDES WOULD-BE TACKLER
Chalked Up 191 Yards Total Offense

Not only does he drill his boys
on basketball fundamentals, but
he also instills in them the de-
sire to be great students and
campus leaders.”

Although he has not known
Coach Homer Smith as long,
Kilgo insists that here is an-
other point in Davidson's favor.
“I can truthfully say that I have
never been more impressed with
any man than 1 have with Hom-
er Smith, and the same goes for
his assistants. We believe in
what they're doing.”

The final reason, said Kilgo,
is the presence of Athletic Di-
rector Dr. Tom Scott. ‘‘We are
fortunate to have.a man of his
caliber."

The job of the Sports Informa-
tion Director is essentially to
report to newspaper men and
tell them what Davidson is do-
ing in all areas of sports activ:
ity. It also requires showing the

representatives of the news me-
dia around and help them ac-
quire their information.

Kilgo said that he feels the
greatest discreptingy between
his job and that which he had
envisioned is in his perspective
concerning the press. “In this
job you find out in a hurry how
competitive newspaper and TV
men are, which, of course, they
have every right to be.”

Although he knew a good deal
about Davidson, there is one big
impression left on Kilgo after
his short tenure here. ‘‘T feel,”
he said, ‘‘that I'm a part of one
of the really great academic
schools in the country. It’s in-
spiring to see boys put forth
hustle and determination on the
field in addition to. their aca-
demic efforts."

Whatever the case, it must
feel different to sit on the other
side of the fence.

LEADING SCORER SATURDAY

BY GEORGE ROBINSON
Sports Writer

Giles’ Toe Adds Big Plus

The Wildcats came up with another offensive weapon when John Giles was
thrust upon the kicking scene Saturday.

Giles scored seven points, all
with his toes, to aid the Wild-
eats in their 13-9 victory over
the Colonials. of George Wash-
ington. The 175-pound guard con-
nected on a.seccnd period extra
point attempt and 27 and 29-yard
field goals in the third and
fourth quarters, respectively.

This was the first game in
which Giles has place-kicked.
Pete Glidewell, slated to kick.
suffered a sprained ankle and
so Giles had to fill in. Accord-
ing to Giles, who uses a special
kicking shoe, he felt ‘‘real good"
after the field goals. He did not
kick during his freshman and
sophomore years due to an in-

_jured knee,

BEGAN KICKING AS
YOUNGSTER

Giles has developed his place
kicking ability over a period of
years, starting. when he played
Little League football in the
sixth and seventh grades.

During high school, he played
in Morganton. ‘I started out as
a guard,” he said, “but played

mostly fullback and some half-
back during my senior year. My
father place-kicked some for
North Carolina State and has
helped me a great deal.”

Coach Dave Fagg has helped
Giles this season as well as As-
sistant Dean of Students Jim
Terry. Terry kicked for David-
son the past three years and
holds the Southern Conference
record with 37 straight extra
point conversions.

“T would like to believe that
I can beat his record,’ mused
Giles.

Over the summer Giles work-
ed on his kicking. “I began to
kick the ball higher, which helps
a great deal.”

Giles cited keeping your head
down as the most important fac-
tor in kicking. He is usually out
practicing a half hour before the
rest of the squad.

After warming up with extra
point kicks, Giles works on field
goals. “I kick mostly straight
shots until the 25-yard line. Then
I try from different angles. In
practice I have made 40-yard

field goals, which is a 50-yard
carry.”

KICKS UNDER PRESSURE

During regular practice he
kicks while teammates rush ‘at
him yelling and screaming.
“Coach Homer Smith even
throws his hat at me, trying to
distract me.”

Besides place kicking. Giles
plays a cornerback position. A
letterman last year as a sopho-
more, he was switched from his
linebacker position this season.

“TI feel like I’ve gotten better.
I just have to get the feel of
this new position.”

Defensive Coach Dick Tomey
said, “John has worked very
hard. He has a lot of responsibil-
ity on every play, and his best
offensive ball is still ahead of
him.”

Head Coach Homer Smith
said, ‘“‘John is a member of our
fine golf team, and, as a result,
has the ability to produce what-
ever he is capable of under pres-
sure. If he did not have that abil-
ity. I would not have called on
him to kick."

though, they have the potential
to beat any ‘team in the confer-
ence.”

Furman lost to a ‘‘very strong”
Parsons team in their opening
game. The Paladins are led by

co-captains Jimmy Kerr, and
David Davidson, whom. Furman
Coach Bob King calls “the best
tackle in the conference.” Also
starring for Furman are Dick

Poole, Glidewell
Pace ’Cat Win

By JOHN FRICK
Sports Writer

’ Coach Homer Smith said this
week ‘“‘hard work and determi-
nation’ gave the ‘Cats their 13-9
upset victory over George Wash-
ington here Saturday.

“The boys worked real hard
at Camp Carolina this month,”
Smith said, “and I told them
they were ready for GW.”

Smith gave much credit for
the victory to quarterback Jim-
my Poole, who, Smith said,
played “his best college game.”
The 165-pound senior completed
12 of 16 passes for 108 yards and
one TD.

“Jimmy did a marvelous job,"*
Smith said. “And he’s getting
better all the time. He can hit
a hundred in a row when he
has protection.”

The other end of the ‘Cat aeri-
al attack was end Pete Glide-
well, who hauled down nine
passes for $ yards, setting a
school record for most passes
caught in a ‘game. The old rec-
ord was seven set by Bill Rikard
in a 23-7 loss to GW last year.

The ’Cats kicked off the scor-
ing nearly in the second quar-
ter when Poole hit Glidewell
with an eight yard pass to pay-
dirt, capping a 74 yard drive.
Guard John Giles then kicked
two field goals. a 27 yarder in
the third quarter and a 29 yard
boot in the fourth, besides an
extra point, to wrap up the scor-
ing for the ‘Cats.

Quarterback Glenn Davis gave
the Colonials their only TD of
the afternoon, as the 175-pound
junior scampered three yards
around right end late in the
third quarter. Fullback Mark
Gross kicked a 30-yard field goal
late in the second quarter for
GW's only other points.

The Colonials threatened early
in the first quarter, as end Gary
Brain smared a pass from Davis
and plowed 42 yards to the Da-
vidson 37 before cornerback
Tommy Dews brought him down.
The. ‘Cat defense, led by half-
back Dick Lindsay and Giles
stiffened and ground the GW
drive .to a halt.

The victory over GW was the
first in four meetings against
the Colcnials.

Offensive Unit
Chooses Name

Davidson's offensive unit has
finally found a name to match
the. defensive unit's nickname,
Gurkhas.

Based on the way they jump-
ed on George Washington for
13 points Saturday while giving
no indication of being overpow-
ering, the offense has named
themselves ‘Poole Shark and
His Hustlers.”

The poole shark is quarterback
Jimmy Poole, who between limp-
ing after every time he carried
the ball, and avoiding linemen
as if his life depended on it,
guided the Wildcats to victory
over an opponent rated as much
as a two-touchdown favorite.

While much of the spirit of
the football team came from the

Gurkhas last year, the offense
has taken the ball and become
the guiding force of the team, a
source revealed.

Members of the Hustlers back-
field are flanker Johnny Walk-
er, tailback Billy Taylor and full-
back Kerry Keith.

Linemen are ends Pete Glide-
well and Bill Rikard, tackles
Gary Waldron and Kit Thomp-
son, guards Joe Murphy and Bill
Webb and center Walter Greene.

The joint determination of
these 11 has relieved Coach Hom-
er Smith of nights of worry
whether the ‘Cats could move
the ball this year. Last week’s
win over GW made believers
out of everyone.

Hewell, at quarterback and end
Dusty Chichester.

“We must play with the same
enthusiasm as last week,”
Smith said, “if we are to win.”

When told of Davidson's spir-
it, King said, ‘‘Ole Homer seems
to think he has a corner on the
spirit and hustle market. We're
going to show him what spirit
and hustle really means.”

Davidson will go into the game
without the services of lineback-
er Joe Gaddy who was injured
in the George Washington game,

Also on the injured list is de-
fensive end Buddy Newsome,
who suffered a dislocated shoul-
der in Wednesday night's prac-
tice. Newsome is expected to be
lost to the team for about three
weeks. No replacement has been
named.

SI Picks ’Bama
To Take Third

National Crown

(Reprinted from
Sports ttlustrated)

Sports ‘\lustrated has again
picked Alabama to roll to a third
consecutive national football
championship. Alabama Coach
Paul ‘Bear’ Bryant says 205-
pound tackle Cecil Dowdy is
the best he has ever -coached.
The Bear sports 34 lettermen, a
fast, experienced team, and a
less than demanding schedule.

Other southern teams expect-
ed to finish high in the national
ratings include Georgia. LSU,
Tennessee, Mississippi, Georgia
Tech and Clemson.

Tackle George’ Patton will
spark the defense for the Geor-
gia Bulldogs, which also boast
two good fullbacks and a 9.5
sprinter. This year the Bulldogs
will be spared encounters. with
such powers as LSU, Tennes-
see and Alabama.

Nine starters on offense and
seven defensive specialists are
gene from LSU, but Nelson
Stokley and 230 pound _ strong-
back Billy Masters can be count-
ed on to head a hard-nosed de-
fense for the Tigers.

All eyes are. on Richmond
Flowers at Tennessee, which has
a team with strength and depth
in all denartments. Paul Naum-
off. the Vols’ top defensive ace,
will move to linebacker. *

Mississippi lost. some key
players and facés a rough sched-
ule, but has 34 lettermen and a
tough, aggressive defense spark-
ed by linebacker Lee Gamer.

Georgia Tech's Bobby Dodd
brought in new assistants and
shifted several men from his
well-stocked offense to his char-
itable defense. Look for quar-
terback Kim King to sweep the
Tech schedule which includes
seven home games.

Clemson looks like an ACC
champion, especially since Duke,
UNC and USC have been dis-
qualified from winning the top
berth because of failing to sched-
ule enough conference games.
Coach Frank Howard has groom-
ed a big and experienced offen-
sive line and a bevy of good
| receivers.
