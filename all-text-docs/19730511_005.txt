LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Student Senate Seen
As Ineffective, Aloof

To the Editor:

This letter has been written to
explain why I believe the SGA
Senate has come to be regarded
as an aloof, unimportant, and
ineffective body by the students
at Davidson.

At the present time most
senators see themselves as
members of an elite group of
well informed ‘‘leaders’’ who
know what the score really is.
Thus they do not take into con-
sideration what they believe is
the opinion of most of the
student body on many issues.

For that matter, they do not
believe that the student body
has developed an opinion about
most issues. The senators might
be right in holding this view,
because they fail to see the
Senate’s proper function as
being a body which should
define and mobilize student
opinion.

The Senate's only power base
is the student body.

Until the Senate comes to
realize this and moves away
from the view that it is a power-
ful body in and of itself, it will
never be regarded as a viable,
important, and effective force
on campus.

The Senate should come to
realize that its power is
mobilized student opinion. It
should take steps to help the
student body formulate opirion
by providing it with the essen-
tial information from which to
develop an opinion.

The Senate should let stu-
dents know about upcoming
decisions in Senate meetings
and details about surfacing
issues on campus.

Once the Senate has provided

students with information about
issues and important changes
they are trying to bring about,
the Senate should exploit the
resulting opinion to the fullest
by calling on students to write
letters to trustees, talk to
faculty members, ad-
ministrators, and staff mem-
bers, while utilizing petitions,
the press, and lobby.

None of this could actually
come about until the Senate
changes also its basic approach
to issues.

At the present time I feel like
the Senate is listlessly adrift
among the real issues on cam-
pus.

It has never come together as
a group and decided these are
the things we would like to bring
about on the Davidson campus
and this is how we will do it.
Thus, the Senate never con-
fronts the issues head-on.

It nibbles around the edges at
the symptoms and not the
causes. It has no goals. It
doesn’t know where it is going
and neither does anyone else.

Real planning just doesn’t go
on.

I appeal to the Senate leader-
ship and all the senators to take
these ideas into consideration
as we begin thinking about next
year.

I know my fellow senators
will say there's not enough time
to do this, and I agree. But
we're going to have to make
time by sacrificing some of our
leisure time.

If we don't then I seriously
question whether Davidson
student government will ever

‘be a viable campus force.

Koloditch Seeks To Repeal
Extended Studies Requirement

To the Editor:

Now that the Honors College
has been ‘re-evaluated’’, it’s
high time Davidson's whole
academic program was re-
evaluated. I am referring
especially toarea requirements,

Extended Studies, and the
language requirement.
Extended Studies is the worst
offender. In the catalogue, it
looked like a great idea, but
upon arriving’ here, I
Gocovered that that was not the

Code Of Academia Prohibits

Expression Of Human Feelings

By HOWARD RAMAGLI

(After having served as Operations
Manager for the Union during the past
year, Ramagli is headed for Harvard
Graduate School of Education under a one
year grant to get his Masters in
Education. ) ;

Spectacle and drudgery. Joy and pain.
Four years for a piece of paper. And then
what? Has anything been gained or lost?
Was it all worth it? And then, you're there
for another year.

Part of the learning process is the
reassessment of the experience, an ex-
perience of lost opportunities and new
hopes, the experience of attending David-
son. Four years in search of one's
humanity and human relationships.

Lost years of wandering through the
academic forest of barren trees in the
belief that numbers and letters were not
the ultimate end of education.

And so it was that the journey ended with
the pronouncement, another generation
has met the requirements and now is
ready to face the world; we have given
them all we have to offer.

Wrong.

The only things that have been given
have been grades and grade point
averages, a false promise of admission to
graduate school, fake social relationships,
and spoon-fed knowledge. Pay your money
and you will be told the answers to the
questions of life, written in a testbook.

Let us prepare you for graduate school,

law school, or med school. Do not stop af-°

ter Davidson and do not collect yourself, if
there is anything left.

So you decide to take off from ‘‘school”’
for a year, to work, to put your head back
on,.and to find out what you have become.
And you decide to stay at that place which
has had the most effect on your life and
what you are.

You begin the year cautiously, trying to
sort out the transition from student to
‘“‘adult."’ You observe the place, and the
people, old and new, and slowly you begin
to realize that what you have become and
where your life will take you is not because
of that place, but rather in spite of that in-
stitution that has controlled your life for
four years.

You begin to watch your experience for
the last four years, as other people act it
out for you. It’s the same scenario, the one
you thought unique for yourself, the one
that has been the same for 135 years. Why?
Why!! ! ! !

The answer. Old crusty paintings of days
long ago. Weather-beaten bricks and
eroded foundations. And loyalty. Loyalty
to the ideals of some forgotten life form,
loyalty to the institution, the place, the
academic life. Not the person, the in-
dividual and his needs for growth as a
human being.

Yours is not to question why: yours but
to study away and see only the words of a
book. You are not to see people, only their
forms. You are to speak words, but not
hear them. You are to perform, not live.

It’s that Davidson experience, that force
which takes away life. It gives you a piece
of paper in exchange for your humanity,
your creativity, your understanding, your
life.

And you don't care. You don’t care. You

believe in the window dressing. The Ex-
tended Studies curtains, the Honors
College latch, the Blue Sky panes. You
don’t want to know anything except
student activities cars, a split term calen-
dar, and Spring Frolics on the right date.

You don’t want education asa learning ex-
perience. You want the book-memorized,
term paper, final exam experience. You
want the party, get drunk, get high, don't-
let-me-feel experience. You don’t want to
know people are falling apart, dying while
trying to live. You don’t want to look in the
mirror and see what you are. You don't
care.

You see it, want to do something. If you
speak out, you are reprimanded by an ad-
ministration, an ineffective, inefficient,
impersonal, I-don't-care-either ad-
ministration. You want to try and then
realize that there is nothing you can do. It
is hopeless.

Hopeless because they can’t change,
because they won't change, because no one
wants the change, any change. You must
accept the Davidson experience as is. Try
to change it and you are ignored or even-
tually you are killed.

Do not live, feel, get to really know a per-
son, see the world with fresh eyes. It is
against the code of academia. You are not
to be human.

So you leave, leave it all, knowing it will
not change. There is not hope. You don’t
want to come back because you know what
you will find. You care, feel, live, but it
doesn't matter.

You are not to be human, don’t ask
anyone to be. It is only natural to leave,
natural to be-gone.

Aside from finding something
to do, one must also worry
about finding a sponsor. Just
finding one is difficult enough.
Finding a sponsor for offbeat
subjects is another matter en-
tirely.

Still another drawback is
that Extended Studies pre-
empts any possibility of
carrying a double major,
because one must take Ex-
tended Studies in his major
junior and senior years.

Which brings me to my main
point. Extended Studies takes
away four courses one could be
taking at Davidson.

Add the language re-
quirement, area requirements,
and major its and
what do you have?

You have a_ bottled-up
schedule in which many courses
you would like to take are
replaced by courses you have to
take, all the while paying $3,500
a year for this ‘‘privilege”’.

All this isn't just to mouth off.
I do have some concrete
suggestions:

1. Make Extended Studies op-
tional, so that interested stu-
dents can take advantage of it

and the others won't be bothered
by it.
2. Redesign the area

requirements so that each
student can exempt the one out
of the four areas he likes least.
This would relieve much
‘aggravation and open up more
courses that the student is in-
terested in.

3. Abolish the language
requirement entirely. Most
students who dislike languages
learn them poorly anyway,
even if someone could show a
valid reason for having a
language requirement in the
first place.
