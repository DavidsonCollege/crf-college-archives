OFFICERS ELECTED BY
GOLF ASSOCIATION

The following men have‘ been chosen as
officers of the Davidson Golf Association:
Doctor Arbuckle, president; — Professor
Wood, treasurer; J. S. Bachman, manager,
and C, W. MeRary, secretary.

Boctor Arbuckle gave a short talk on the
game at a recent meeting of the association,
special stress being laid on the fact that
golf is first and last a gentleman's game and
should always be played with this in mind.
He also mentioned a few points of golf

* etiquette that many people seriously neglect,
such as approaching when men are putting on
the graen. The men were also cautioned to
give the usual signal before driving, and
thus mimimizing the danger of accidents.

A tournament will be run off after the
Christmas holidays. The team will be
chosen from the men turning in the best
scores and matches will be arranged with
neighboring clubs. It is hoped that in the
spring the team will make the trip to Dur-
ham for the Olympic games, where they
made such a good showing last year.

The course is now in excellent condition
and many improvements are still under way.
Onevof the most noticeable changes has been
made on green number seven. It has a rather
novel shape, but much easier to ap-
proach than previously.

Golf has had an uphill fight at Davidson,
but at last it has been put on a sound basis.
New men are coming out every day and are
learning to enjoy the game, and who knows,
but that future champions will claim Da-
vidson as their Alma Mafer?

MANY STARS SHOW UP
IN CLASS BASKET-BALL

The class basketball games this fall did
not draw the large crowds’ which attended
last year, due to the fact that the race for
the flag was not close; but it is doubtful if
any champion of former years could defeat
the well-rounded Soph aggregation which
carried off the honors this season,

The Sophs scored three points to every one
made by their opponents during the season,
and in every way deserved the champion-
ship which they won so decisively. The
Seniors were the hardest team for the Sophs
to defeat. In neither of the two games
played were they able to double the score
while against the Juniors and Freshmen they
ran up top-heavy scores. ‘The defensive
work of the team as a whole, and especially
of the guards featured the games. In the
first game of the season the Juniors were
unable to shoot a field goal and only 24 were}

rung up against them in the six games
played.

The-race for second place honors was the
real fight and the Juniors and Seniors came
off with the honors even. The Juniors won
the first game by a three-point margin and in
the second encounter the Seniors nosed the
Juniors out by one point. By comparative
scores in the Soph games the Seniors seem
to be the best team by a big margin, but in
the Fresh games the Juniors had the best
of the argument. In the six games, the
Seniors scored 18 points less than their op-
ponents while the Juniors were 28 points
behind when the season closed.” All in all the
teams were very evenly matched» and the
standing shows their comparative strength.

The Freshmen had a disastrous season,
losing all of their starts but showing flashes
of form at times which made them danger-
ous contenders. The Seniors and Juniors
both narrowly escaped defeat at their hands,
the Seniors nosing them out by one point in
the first game, and the Juniors coming from
behind to win the season's final contest,
22-16.

The great passwork and defensive play of
the Sophs was due in large part to Mac
Beall, who coached them. They passed all
around the other teams, piling up large
scores, while their guards kept down the
scores of their opponents, Ted Koenig cap-
tained the team and starred through the sea-
son at his position of stationary guard.

ALL-CLASS BASKET-BALL
TEAM HARD TO SELECT

The four captains of the class teams and
the varsity letter men each made a first and
second all-class pick for the Davidsonian
and from these selections was made a com-
posite pick, counting two points for a place
on a first team pick and one point for a
place on a second team pick. The highest
number of points which it was possible for
one man to get was 18 and no player was
unanimously selected for his position.

At one-ferward position Mitchell, of the
Sophomore team, was selected. _ Pete was
high point man for the season and his left-
handed shots rarely missed their mark. He
was speedy on the floor and an accurate
passer, a_hard_man_to-guard-at-any-time;

At the other forward position, Staley got
the call. Staley made the trips with the
varsity last spring, and from his showing
in the class series is due to repéat this season.
Sickness kept him out of two games, but in
his four games his long shots helped the
Sophs to pull away from their opponents.

John Anderson was a practically unani-
mous selection for the center position. [He
outjumped the opposing center and played a
fine game under the basket. He rang. up 15
field goals in five games and his presence

tire team.

Ed Morrison, the midget guard of the
Sophs, was given the first guard position.
Playing a running guard, Ed has no equal on
the floor and is famous for his long shots,
Despite his small size, it is opinion of many
players that he has got them all beat and that
they would rather play against anybody than
Ed.

The vote for the second guard position
resulted in a tie between Ted Koenig and
Suk Boggs. Ted Koenig, at stationary
guard, played a great game and broke® up
passes to perfection. He forced the op-
position to make long shots and still found
time to travel up the floor and make several
shots himself. ~ Boggs was on the sidelines
a large part of the time, but when he did
break into the game he showed up as a
guard of the first water. He is the heaviest
man on the team, but is quick on his feet,
pivots well, and guards his man like a
leech,

SECOND TEAM

Elkins and Bostick, of the Junior and
Senior teams, are the forwards on the sec-
ond team and in these two men the second
team has a pair of forwards who would give
the Soph forwards a run for their money.
Both are expert shots and play the Flee
well,

At center McBryde, of the Junior team,
has the call. This tall and lanky center
has shown up well this fall, and with Elkins
has: been the backbone of the Junior team.

Toney and Caddell are the two guards.
Although Toney played forward this season
he receiyed several votes at guard which is
his regular position and was shifted to this
position. Joe Caddell has shown up well on
the Fresh team and deserves the other guard
position.

SOPH QUINTET BEATEN
BY CHARLOTTE “Y” TEAM

Despite the fact that the Soph basketball

quintet was backed up by an unbroken chain
of victories, they met their Waterloo when
they tackled the Charlotte Y. M. C. A. team
in Charlotte last Thursday night and bowed
in defeat to the tune of 46-21. Outplayed by
a larger, more experienced and faster bas-
ketball five, they merit praise for the game
fight they displayed, and the comeback in
the second half shows the remarkable Wild-
cat spirit once more evident.. The Sophs
‘made an excellent showing, however, for the
“Y” defeated the Badin A. C. composed of
college stars, 62-13.
—Phe-Sophs were handicapped to a marked
extent by the smallness of the court. The
boys have been accustomed to using a large
court and the differences in size hampered
their passwork. The Sophs had adopted the
slower and more accurate passwork, ~but
were unable to successfully carry this out.
Passes were easily, and often, intercepted by
the “Y” players.

In the first half the score stood; 28-8 with
the “Y” leading. Davidson’s team was at
sea during this half, but found their bearings
in the second. and landed_at the end of this
period with the “Y” slightly ahead, 18-13.

This was as good a display of basketball
as anyone would like to see, and speaks well
for the grit and determination of the Sophs.
Were it possible for a:return game to be
played at the Gym here, it is believed that
the score would, in all likelihood, be decid-
edly closer, with the possibility of a Soph
victory. -

Without a doubt the star of both teams
was Staley. He stands out as the highest
point man of both teams, 13 points being
chalked up to his credit, followed by Moore,
for the “Y” with 12, Staley has played ‘top-
notch ua throughout the season, but
this contest easily surpassed any he has
participated in thus far. Several of his
points were made by long shots, and he sent
the inflated sphere through the air with un-
canny accuracy.

Staley was forced to retire on personat
fouls just as the final whistle blew. Three
of the fouls were made in the first half, and
it is to his credit to have played through the
second half until just before the last blast
sounded. Boggs held his own at guard in a
commendable manner, and when shifted to
center, because of an injury to Anderson’s
ankle, did not let up on his splendid play-
ing.
