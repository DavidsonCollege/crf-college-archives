NSA Duelists Avoid
Bold Election Claims

BY HARRY CARR

Leaders of both factions debating Davidson's mem-
bership in NSA expressed uncertainty this week about
the outcome of the Nov. 18 referendum.’

Pat Freeny, who spoke against
the NSA at an assembly Oct. 28,
foresaw a close vote with a pos-
sible slim margin in favor, of
withdrawal. John Spratt said,
‘The next two weeks will de-
cide the election.”

In setting the election two
weeks off, Student Council Presi-
dent Spratt emphasized that the
council was not trying to let
the issue fade but rather to
provide an opportunity for stud-
ents to become familiar with
the facts. He revealed that the
council will issue mimeographed
statements which list benefits
of membership for Davidson.

Davidson has been a member
of the association since the
spring of 1961. Previously, the
college had belonged to the
group but had withdrawn.

‘The main reason | am
ageinst the NSA,” Freeny
stated, “is that it has done
nothing at Davidson.” He also
said, “The NSA has overstep-
ped its boundaries by taking e
stand on political issues. This
activity is contradictory to its
constitution. |

“This doesn’t mean that there
is anything wrong with having a
student political organization,”
Freeny added, “but as a sound-
ing board of student opinion,
the NSA is ineffective.” Freeny
went on to say that he would
favor the organization if it did
not try to be both a group for
student political opinion and
an association for student gov-
ernments.

Also, Freeny assailed the NSA
on the Davidson campus be-

cause, “No effort has been
made to acquaint the student
body with the policies of the
NSA.”

On the other side of the issue,
Spratt said, “The NSA had con-
tributed many little things
which have added up to a sig-
nificant effect on the Student
Council, as well as other groups
on campus.” He pointed out that
the Student Council channeled
some of its material from the
NSA to various clubs at the col-
lege for their use in obtaining
speakers, organizing discussions
and attending conferences.

Spratt also mentioned as bene-
fits of the NSA the SGIS library,
which provides student govern-
ment leaders with articles,
papers and results of polls per-
taining to student affairs, and
the automatic membership in
the Educational Travel Inc. The
travel service organizes foreign
tours and lodging for students
at reduced rates, as well as char-
ter flights.

Other advantages, according
to the council president, in-
clude representation by Dav-
idson in such conferences as
the UN Model General Assem-
bly and the State Student
Legislature, the services of
Polback, a clearing house for
information concerning politi-
eal speakers and current af-
fairs and an annual literary
contest which publishes the
winning peper in the “Satur-
day Review.”

Another strong point of the
NSA that Spratt cited was the

sharing of information and ideas

that otherwise would not be
available to a small college such
as Davidson. ‘Perhaps these
ideas won't change the face of
Davidson,” he continued, “but
they will add significantly to
the college.”

As an example of these ideas
he pointed to Davidson’s repre-
sentative for The Moderator
magazine.

In answer to the charge that
the NSA has overstepped its

ed Charlie Marshall to wok into

next week,

The final discussion of the
meeting centered around Vice
President Wil! Jackson‘s sug-

gestion of revising the elec- {

tions procedures. No vote was
taken; however, Jackson pro-
posed two basic chariges: (1)
that no one be allowed to run
for bath student government
{including both the student
council and student body) and
Honor Court offices, and (2)
that the elections be shortened
from 342 weeks to 1/2 weeks.

There: was a wide difference
of opinion on the first sugges-
tion which would prohibit a
person from running for more
than one offfice. It was pointed
out that if the candidate loses,
he would miss his chance for an
office until the next year. But
these changes would also allow
more students to run or student
government offices, creating
more interest in the do-or-die
situation.

“The only objection.” said
Jackson in summation, “is that
some good men might not be
elected.” But he pointed out,
“These rules were put in when
Davidson had less than 500 stud-
ents. Now we have 1,000 stud-
ents and many qualified people
for each office.”

Approval was granted by the
college for a special-forces-type
unit composed of volunteer MS
Il’s and IV’s. Similar units are
already operating with the
Army's blessing at VMI, Eastern
Kentucky, and Eastern Carolina.
The Davidson group grew out
of a staff study by an MS IV Jast
year and interest expressed to
Special Forces veteran Lt. Col.
Paul R. Wheaton, PMS. ,

A third factor was last year’s
night problem conducted by
Capt. Charles C. Partridge for
the tactical benefit of his MS
Tl’s. Response dictated expan-
sion; so when Tarby Bryant ask-
ed about the group this Septem-
ber, he was givén a green light
to organize a provisional special
forces group.

The purpose of the group
is to familiarize its members
with insurgency and counter-
insurgency operations, or to ac-
quaint them with the guerrilla-
teaching role of the Special
Forces, units of which are now
employed in Viet Nam.

Capt. Partridge, cadre offi-
cer in charge, emphasized that
the group was completely
extra-curricular for those in-
terested in learning about
such operations and not a
spring board to Special Forces
enlistment.

Secondary purposes of the
group will be to teach soldier
skills, teach the leadership of
small tactical units, and prepare
juniors for summer camp at Ft.
Bragg. The Davidson unit will
not prime MS [1’s for outstand-
ing performance at Bragg but
will let them know what does
go on there.

It was also hoped that the |

unit would make the distinction
between Special Forces and Ran-
ger operations a little clearer.
Members will learn only enough
of survival and commando skills

to be able to teach them, for the
unit-purpose is to organize parti-
san forces into counter-insur-
gency groups, not carry on com-
mando or guerrilla warfare.

To accomplish this mission,
the unit will be broken down in-
to an administrative, or B, unit
of the MS IV's and the tactical,
or A, units of MS Ill’s. Seniors
will themselves learn and teach
the juniors, supervise the tacti-
eal exercises conducted one
weekend a month, and serve as
aggressors.

The III's will work in teams to
“destroy” power lines, conduct
ambushes, and use the facilities
at Lake Norman for amphibious
operations. Class instruction will
be conducted an hour a week.
Most field work will be at night.

In accordance with the aims
of the group, all personnel

ran

will primarily train in training
others. They will be assisted
in this by the Special Forces
reserve unit in Charlotte. Lt.
Col. Wheaton also will lend
his experience and hopes to
get some help from the Ft.
Bragg units. Cadets will wear
fatigues and, it is hoped, the
Special Forces green beret.
All MS IV’s and MS III's who
can pass the combat proficiency
test are eligible and may parti-
cipate one or both semesters. As
in any college extra-curricular,
the stress is on interest and en-
joyment. The test of pleasure
will come one week from tomor-
row with problems in night com-
pass, communications, and small
arms.
As the Reader’s Digest might
say, “Our Special Forces Are
Ready!”

A native of Germany, Dr.
Margenau received his educa-
tion at Teachers College in Her-
ford, Germany, and Midland Col-
lege. He received his master's
degree from the University of
Nebraska in 1927 and his PhD
from Yale in 1929. He was na-
turalized in 1930 and has re-
ceived numerous honorary de-
grees since then, including an
LLD from Dalhousie University.

Dr. Margenau has taught at
various schools throughout the
United States, including the
University of Nebraska and the
University of California. He has

| been a visiting professor at the

University of Heidelburg and
was the Fuibright lecturer to

the University of Tokyo in 1960.

He has written numerous
books, notably The Nature of
Reality and Open Vistas, and is

_ : an active contributor to scienti-
* 1 fie journals. In addition he has

served on the editorial board of
the Journal of Quantitative Spec-
troscopy and Radiative Transfer
and has served as a consultant
to General Electric, Lockheed

and the Atomic Energy Commis-

- gion.

Each lecturer will speak in
the evening of his first day here
and will deliver an address to

‘the student body the following
day. Some of the speakers may
visit classes during their stay
on campus.

lecturer in the spring, but it is
not yet settled.” This fourth

Academic probation regulations were liberalized as

Thirdly, a student may go off

period; i.e.. mid- or end-semes-
ter.

And fourthly, the six-weeks

President D. G. Martin and
Dean Frontis Johnston. gave as-
surance that any student failing
to meet the standard because
one or more of ‘his course grades
are not turned in for some rea-
son beyond his control will be
given special consideration.

Not brought up at Tuesday's
meeting were the two recom-
mendations mentioned in Jast
week's DAVIDSONIAN: to
give cuts to students on proba-
tion and to have failing stud-
ents meet weekly with profes-
sors where they were having
difficulty.

Perhaps most significant of
all, however, was the decision to
form a committee to study aca-
demic performance in general at
Davidson, including under-
achievement, promotional re-
quirements and academic pro-
bation.

The _ liberalizing measures
were not passed unanimously,
according to reports: some pro-
fessors felt that perhaps the
college was giving too much and
should not encourage athletics
for students who are not pass-
ing. Another comment was made
that it is possible admissions re-
quirements to Davidson have
out-classed academic require-
ments in Davidson.

President Martin commented
favorably on the operation of
the new and much-freer cut sys-
tem and implied a personal Jean-
ing toward “Jetting the student.
go’ to make the grade or not.
But here the responsibility of
the college to students and par-

‘ents becomes a major considera-

tion. Thus it seems evidence of
the Davidson man’s own matur-:
ity and initiative would be neces-
sary.

In a second area of dispute
settled Tuesday. this same
Strategy of ‘liberality’ and
“freedom” is in evidence. By
unanimous vote, the faculty
adopted a resolution on possible
censorship of speakers:

“An essential part of the
education of each student at
Davidson College is the oppor-
tunity to hear diverse view-
points expressed by speakers
invited to the campus by stud-
ent organizations as well as by
members of the faculty and
administration. (t is highly de-
sirable that students have the
opportunity to question, re-
view, and discuss the opinions
of speakers representing a
wide range of viewpoints.”
To assure that Davidson is

visited by a wide variety of

stimulating speakers, a five-man
committee (two from the facul-

ty. two from the student body
and one from the administra-
tion) will be appointed to co-
ordinate scheduling. And in this
scheduling, “no speaker will be
rejected because of his mem-
bership in an organization.”

In connection with possible,
controversial speakers, three
principles will be in effect. First,
the committee will see that an
alternative viewpoint is given
representation on the campus
within a reasonable period of
time. ‘

Second, the committee may
remove the attendance re-
quirement at assemblies
where such speakers are ap-
pearing.

Finally, it will be the com-
mittee’s responsibility 10 make
‘all aware that the views being
expressed are not necessarily
those of Davidson College.

This resolution in full has
been made available to the stud-
ent body in memeographed
form.

Journalist
Will Speak
On Monday

W. D. “Bill” Workman, a
noted conservative journal-
ist and former Republican
candidate for the U.S. Sen-
ate from South Carolina,
will speak Monday night at
7:15 in the Morrison Room
of the College Union.

A long-time reporter on the
South Carolina governmental
and political scene, Workman

he served in the Army for five
years and currently is a colonel
in the Army Reserve.

At the end of. World War I,
the journalist established a
News and Courier bureau in
Columbia and began an extend. ,
ed career as a capital correspon-
dent, covering government,
polities, and other significant
aspects of South Carolina life.
He later became correspondent
also for The Greenville News
and other southern newspapers.

From 1954 through 1961 he
was the South Carolina corres-
pondent for Southern School
News and for many years rep-
resented Newsweek magazine,
In addition he has been a news
commentator on several South
Carolina radio and television
stations.

Bishop from Barnwell, a biogra-
phical study centered upon
South Carolina politics.

He has also written The Case
for the South and participated in
the writing of three other books.

In 1960 he began a three-
times-weekly syndicated column
which was published throughout
the South and East. Assuming
the position of Associate Editor
of The State in Columbia in
December, 1962, he gave up the
column.

Workman ran for the US.
Senate from South Carolina in
November, 1962.. While failing

east, he received the largest Re-
publican vote in South Carolina
since the Reconstruction era.

Workman’s visit is being spon-
sored by the Conservative Club.
