Fall crop of Rusk Scholars arrives

By PREM MANJOORAN
From across the Atlantic they might be, but they
certainly are no strangers to Davidson. Every year
the college sees an influx of abitof British stiff upper
lip in the form of the “Ruskies”--the Dean Rusk
Exchange Scholars to give them their formal desig-

nation.

They’re only here until Christmas, but Lucy Con-
greve, Siobhan (pronounced Shevon) Boa, Tabby
Gentleman, Anthony Jackson, Dan Parsons, and
Piers Thomas are already well on their way to
establishing a rapport with their surroundings that
would rival most freshman four year students.

___ All six students are from St. Paul’s, London. But
while the girls’ school is in East Kensington, the
boys study in Barnes. The contact between the
schools is quite minimal. Apart from the same name,
the occasional drama or music performance, and
Davidson College, they share very little else in
common. In fact, believe it or not, none of this year’s
Rusk scholars have ever studied in a “co-ed” class
before. Here’s where class at Davidson can offer an

indelible American experience!

St. Paul’s is an “academic” school according to

Davidson to develop a first-hand, working knowl-
edge of -the American psyche while “studying
courses they’ve never taken before and will proba-
bly never have the opportunity to.take again.”
Lucy, Siobhan, Tabby, Anthony, Dan, and Piers
have all just passed out of the English equivalent of

high school and have, in effect, taken the year off.

Coincidentally, after their Davidson stint.is com-
pleted, all of them except Piers will travel to China.
How’s that for variety? Charlotte to Shanghai
to...Cambridge/Oxford. Any takers? -
Lucy was convinced that in London she could =
probably spot an American from a little over a mile |
away: the chewing gum, the Nike sneakers, the Sony =
video camera and the overemphasized drawl. Much
to their delight, the group did not encountered these
stereotypes here at Davidson. In fact, they say
they’ve been quite overwhelmed by the warmth and
helpfulness they have encountered, be it somebody
explaining the intricacies of the football field, or _
someone demonstrating the steps of a square dance.
Anthony is quite unequivocal when he asserts, ©

“People are just too friendly to be true.”

Yet their stay in American has not been trouble-

these students--no wonder they have an exchange
program with Davidson! The six of them represent

the icing on the St. Paul’s cake, and they’ ve come to

A freshman’s perspective of Davidson

By HEATH HARDAGE

At 8:00 a.m., as I stare into my
interchangeable breakfast/lunch/
dinner of Grape Nuts and Sweet
‘N Low, many thoughts begin to
creep. sluggishly through my
mind. Why am I here at college?
What personal goals do I have for
myself? What direction will my
life at Davidson point me in? And
most importantly, how in the heck
am I going to get those peach
daiquiri stains off my rug?

For any freshman entering col-
lege, the first two weeks of school
are a period of adjustment. This
time presents both new delights
and new problems. The realiza-
tion that you have taken on a great
freedom coupled with a great re-

sponsibility takes some getting
used to. As a result, most fresh-
men find that their biggest quan-
dary arises when they are faced
with the omnipresent distractions
of hall gossip sessions, stereos,
campus special events, and week-
day parties. —~

People (presumably) come to
Davidson to increase the level of

_ their education. All freshmen

have repeatedly heard _ parental
admonitions to “remember the
reason we sent you to college!”
Therefore, the good intentions of
a naive freshman include getting
to bed at areasonable time, eating
from all four food groups, and
making studying the main prior-
ity. Unfortunately, these Gatsby-

esque resolves are all thrown out
the window within a week. Pro-
crastination doesn’t take long to
set in. Soon the quotation “Medi-
ocrities everywhere, I absolve
you” becomes the freshman stu-
dent’s motto. (This apt comment

“was “inscribedon “a’Davidson*

study carrel.)

Although we all know that most
Davidson students would never
think of going out-past 10 p.m.,
there is that small percentage of
people who find themselves
going out every night until 3 a.in.
(Playing tiddly-winks, of course.)

Red-eyed hallmates shuffling
listlessly to classes become quite
a common sight. Even you, O
Virtuous Reader, may be finding
