Work of Alumnus
Used as Textbook

It is perhaps unknown to Davidson stu-
dents who are taking the Gourse in Chemistry

IV, as well as to alumni of Davidson, that
the textbook, “Inorgannic Physical Chem-
istry,” which is used in that course, was
written by a Davidson graduate, Dr. G. H.
Cartledge.

Dr. Cartledge graduated from Davidson in

1911, obtaining his Master of Arts degree,

the- following year. He then went to the
\

Vat of Chicago, when he was granted

a Ph.D./degree, and became professor of

Chemistry at Presbyterian College of South; The following is the extract:

“Carolina immediately thereater.

When Dr. Martin was elected president of
Davidson in 1912, much of the work in the
Chemistry department was turned over to
him as a Senior, But in 1917, he returned
to Davidson in a greater capacity, coming
here as assistant professor in Chemistry and
Physics, He was an expert chemist in gov-
ernment service in Washington and in New
Jersey during the World War, and since
1920 he has been
Chemistry at Johns-Hopkins University.

His work was copyrighted in 1924, and ac-
cording to Prof. O. J. Thies, of the Chem-
istry department here, it is an excellent text-
book—“one of the best that I have read,”

said Mr, Thies, who is in charge of this par-

ticular course.

Statistical Report Shows Leaders in
“Loyalty League” Drive

The following extracts from a letter mail-
ed to local association officers by the alumni
secretary last Saturday is largely self-ex:
planatory. He has prepared a statistical re-
port on the number of contributors from
each association, the total amount, the num-
ber of alumni in each organization, and the
percentage of their giving toward this work
The statistics below show only the percentage
on March 11th, and the latest report, which
shows that two association president have
been active.

To Officers of Local Associations :

The Louisville Alumni Association stepped |
into the lead the last few days of this month, |
and the Greensboro Association advanced two
notches on the scale. Statesville slipped into
second when Louisville advanced from 17.7
per cent to 55 per cent, while Atlanta and
County were left behind when
Greensboro spurted forward. The percent- |
age of cight associations did not change last
month,

Gaston

Presidents of the Louisville and Greens- |
boro organizations sent out letters to their |
members. You see the results. Nine new |
contributors came in from Greensboro, while
eight were noted from Louisville. Procras-
tination on the part of Davidson alumni is
proving a deterrent to this work. All that
many of them need is a reminder from their

officers.

Military Company

Organized in 1853 |

Of interest: to those connected with: the |
college is the fact that the first military unit |
to be organized at Davidson was instigated |
by the students themselves, in November, |
1853, |

The following, taken from the petition, |

was unanimously endorsed by the trustees:

ar

Lhe students of Davidson College, having
formed a military company for the purpose
of exercising themselves in military tactics,
and for their own benefits in other respects,

RRERRARRNTRRRRRRARALENEREY,

we, the officers of the said company, do |
petition the faculty for permission to use |

arms and drill three times a week, namely,
on Tuesday and Thursday mornings a half
hour after breakfast and on Saturday eve

ning, :

“The arms to be placed under their care;
we submitting to their direction as required |

by the laws of the college. |
“(Signed) Capt. J. A. Allison, Ist Lieut. |
. C, Caldwetl, 3rd Lieut. T. P. Stirling.”

It is not known how long this company |

faculty arranged the regular college duties
so as to encourage the organization as far as
possible without interfering with the college
work. The government granted them a few
ancient guns which were utilized as well as
possible, The captain and the driving force
of the company was D. H. Hill, class of £80.
Their need of uniforms and lack of any
natural inducement gradually lessened the
enthusiasm until the company died a natural
death. So ended the second attempt at sol-

diery at Davidson.
