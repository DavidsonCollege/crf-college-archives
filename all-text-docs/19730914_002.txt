Scott Responds To Problems
Concerning ARA Food Service

By KATHERINE MORTON
Staff Writer

Each year, students have dif-
ficulties adjusting to the Slater
Food Service at Davidson, as
well as the service adjusting to
the whims of the students.

It takes about two weeks for
people to settle down to a bit of
consistency, according to Ron
Scott, director of ARA Slater.

“The freshmen, especially,
have problems figuring out this
complex system, and learning
to benefit from it.”

Students may not realize it,
but the food service has
problems too. Sometimes Slater
must do without food orders
because they come in a few
days late.

Scott plans to start posting a
menu as soon as the food orders
begin coming in on a consistent
basis

As last year, iced tea, coffee,
and punch are 15 cents each,
with no limt on refills. If two
cups or more are taken,
however, students will be
charged for two.

“This helps cut down on the
number of cups used, as some
people have used as many as
10 cups per meal. These cups
run the food service about five
cents apiece.

“This can be looked at from
the ecological viewpoint as a
way to cut down on waste. It
also would be a primary factor
in saving some money each
meal,”’ Scott said.

Another question that has
arisen involves the Bailey
House. Dinner at Bailey House
does not include dessert with
the price of a meal. It includes a
salad, potato, vegetable, roll,
and a butter.

Another reminder is that if
anyone gets a refill at Richards
or Bailey Houses, he is asked to
stop by the cash register on his
way out.

Two other things Scott is con-
cerned about have to do with
being mooched upon, and the
protection of your meal tickets.
In Rusk House, the problem has
arisen of one person feeding
others through his option of

not be permitted.

Scott also brought out an im-
portant point about the meal
tickets.

‘I have noticed several

their entire
meal booklets around with
them. Books have been lost, and
are difficult to trace. Such a loss
means either going hungry, or
buying another set,”’ he said.

Scott was very concerned
about this, and urged that a per-
son should carry around only
one ticket, and leave the rest
where they will be safe.

Another problem with meal
tickets involves the practice of

itting the ticket into two
taives. People who have done
this find that they are left
holding a worthless half, and
must face the consequences.

A meeting is planned for the
very near future, in which Ron
Scott will answer any questions
students might have about the
food service. ‘‘I want to make an
effort to hear what students
have to say about the food ser-
vice, whether they be pro or
con. I have received little feed-
back from the students because
the majority have not taken
the time to come by and see
me,”’ he said.

$1 Transcript Fee Again

The Registrar's Office has announced that effective on

July 1 the fee for each transcript, after the complimentary
initial one, is $1. This represents a change from the $2 fee in

effect for the past two years.

Registrar Richard C. Burts Jr. explained, ‘The prior fee of
$2, after the complimentary initial one, was a ‘loader’ fee and
in a sense was pre-payment for the supplementary transcript
which was later issued at no fee. Our experience showed two
difficulties with the $2 fee: first, a significant number of our
students and alumni did not ever request a supplementary
transcript and in that sense did not get full benefit of the $2
fee. Second, a good number of students and some alumni
asked for and received supplementary transcripts well in ex-
cess of the one intended in the fee.

“Of course, the $2 fee worked well in many cases, too, but
the inequities of ‘too few or too many’ led us to establish a fee
of $1 for each transcript, after the complimentary initial one.
We are simply dropping the concept of free transcripts and
supplementary transcripts. I think the fairness of the new fee
will be apparent to all and will be well accepted.”’

Gaige Expands Foreign Study

By JIM PAULSEN
Contributing Editor
Through his position as
Director of the International
Education Office, South Asian
Studies Professor Frederick H.
Gaige hopes to expand foreign
study abroad to include more
opportunities for full year study
and development of more short
term foreign study

opportunities.

“I personally believe that
every Davidson student should
have some experience of living
abroad in a study or work
situation,” he said.

Gaige feels that more short
term study abroad programs,

similar to the present Classics

abroad Seminar in which
students travel with a professor
in' Greece and Italy for one
school term, will become
available.

“I would be pleased to see
Davidson faculty developing
one term or summer study
abroad programs which could
be designed to _ each
department’s standards,” he
said.

Gaige pointed out that such
study-travel would
help to bring Davidson faculty
and students closer together.

“‘With the exception of some
of the hard science disciplines,
there are foreign studies which
could be organized in any

department,’ said Gaige.

Another focus which he plans
to implement is working with
freshmen in planning their
curriculum around plans to
study abroad.

“I think it is possible for a
freshman, whether pre-med,
pre-law or pre-doctorate, to
organize his courses so he can
spend a year abroad without
jeopardizing his chances to
enter graduate school,’’ Gaige
indicated.

Gaige emphasized that there
are all kinds of international
experiences available to
Davidson students including
both study programs and work
opportunities.

“] don’t see any precipitous
increase in Davidson students
studying abroad, but I would
like to see a rise in the number
of students involved in the
foreign studies program,” he
said.

Besides making other
cultures come alive, Gaige
remarked that foreign study
sharpens the perceptions of our
own culture and enhances the
development of empathy
between different cultures.

“I believe that international
studies and experience of living
abroad are integral parts of a
liberal arts education,’’ Gaige
concluded.
