We're in the Army Now?

o

The three-year-old temper tantrum tactics of Bob Collins
are frankly unwelcome in the Davidson family. Collins is the
new Director of Facilities: Planning who joined us from The

Citadel, and as far as doing his job, not many can say that he has "

been slothful. But forget what he has done for the moment.
Forget the new parking lots and much needed Patterson Court
house rennovations. Forgetevery accomplishment of this man
because every accomplishment has been negated by the manner

in which he practically screams at others as if he were the drill

sargeant and they were the worthless private.

For example, when Collins condemned the SAE Ratice
recently, he entered during lunch, breezed past everyone, and
told the cooks to leave, that the place was unfit to eat ameal. The
house was, in fact, unsanitary, but Collins ignored the students
at the house. He assumed they were allowing the garbage of the
night-before party to ferment due to laziness. Since he didn’t
ask questions, he didn’t know that the house had not been
cleaned at that point because students had classes in the morn-
ing and couldn’t clean until the afternoon. When he met with

members of the house and discussed the issue cool- -headedly,

agreements were made--diplomatically.

Rumor even has it that Collins recently condemned his
wife’s kitchen because she left some pots on the counter.

It is obvious that our new Facilities Planner wants to be
taken seriously. It is obvious that much needed jobs are being
completed because of him. And this is good. Things are getting
done. Therefore, we know you are serious.

So lighten up. You’re not at The Citadel anymore; you’re in
Davidson. Take off your uniform and put your whip away.

Towing Dudes Want Pickup

To the Editors:

I was so thrilled by your
erudite article, “The Wreck-
ers of Autumn” (The
Davidsonian, September 13,
1990).

Weatthe Texacoreceive
very little public recognition,
and seeing our name in print
was very gratifying.

However, several of your
insinuations require clarifi-
cation. Referring to us as
“towing dudes” seems to
indicate truly “together
Nineties” kind of guys.

Alas, I’m afraid we’re
just not at all modish fel-
lows; we’d be more aptly
described as anachronisms

locked in the Fifties.

Your article further indi-
cated that we'll spend our
wealth gained from towing
to purchase a new, red lam-
bourghini, spinning about
the strects of Davidson,
sounding the horn and wav-
ing gleefully before speed-
ing a way to anew home on
the lake.

A red Lambourghini?
Hardly. I’d probably prefer
a new pickup truck in an
carth - tone shade of brown
or green, a truck for hauling

‘trees and shrubs from the

nurscry, one in which I could
transport my dog to the vet
and perhaps stop in and buy
him acone of ice cream; he

loves vanilla.

And as for a new home
on the lake, I’m afraid I’m
just not the gregarious type
suited for lake life; I’dlikely
opt for arural home sctamid
acres of trces.

So, I now suppose most
of your misconceptions have
been corrected. In doing so,
I hope I haven’t diminished
the level of gratitude all of
usatthe Texaco feel for your
providing us with recogni-
tion through the mighty,
printed word.

Sincerely,
September 19, 1990

Baxter Wrong to Accuse Collins

To the Editors:

We are writing in re-
sponse to Jared Baxter’s
article last weck concerning
Bob Collins. _ While Mr.
Baxter is correct in his as-
sertion that many of the is-

-| sues facing the SGA this year -
do involve Mr. Collins, he is

wrong to associate our new
physical plant director with
the enforcement of parking
regulations. We hope that
Mr. Baxter will take more
care in researching his ar-

ticles in the future.

Also, we, as the chair-
persons of the SGA Security
Committee, are encourage
by the marked improvement
in the lighting situation on
campus (including in the new
parking in lot). Like Mr.
Baxter, we: wish the im-
provements could be made
instancously, but these
things do take time and
moncy (hence the’ decision
to fabricated rather than buy
the light poles).

Thanks to Mr. Collin’s

“comparison shopping,”
Davidson will be able to
install a greater number of

_ lights in the near future. We

feel that Mr. Collinsis doing
an outstanding job for the
college and are appreciative
of his efforts.

Sincerely,

September 25, 1990

Columnist Crystal Close-Minded

To the Editors:

Maybe we just misun-
derstood the point you were
trying to make in your opin-
ions article last week, Mr.

Crystal, but we thought that
Sara's article had some good
things to say about. being
able to "do your own thing,”
and that yours sounded like
a very closc-minded sexist

backlash at something we
didn't even find offensive.

Sincerely,
MARLO COBB '91
KELLY PETOSKEY '91

Semesters to Get Longer?

Every student is about
to be thoroughly shaftcd!!
On October Sth the faculty
willacceptasemester sched-
ule which will add another
week to your semester. Does
this make you annoyed,
angry? Well I am!

There’s not one ounce
of logic behind this.

They want to: start fall
classes on Monday instead
of Tuesday; axe a day from
our fall break; axea day from
our Thanksgiving break;
completely abolish our read-
ing day; shorten our exam
period from seven to five
days; and then they have the
audacity toexpectus back in
school on January 4th!!

This isridiculous. Come
on teachers, are you think-
ing atall? This is absolutely
inhumane. We’re in the sixth

week right now -- and I’m

swamped! My cntire exis-
‘tence has been centered on
fall break when I’ll hope-
fully be able to catch my
breath.

I’m tired, overworked
and stressed out-- and I know
damn well I’m not the only
one. If you expect our best
work, you have to give us
the environment to produce
itin. And grinding ourspines
into powder by relentlessly
piling.on the work is no way
to do it.

Well, before the wide-
spread. panic, anarchy and
lynchings start, this proposal
is for the 1992-93 school
year. But it’s going to be
passed on Oct. 5th,

So we have to act now!!
My firstreactions werealong
the lines of sit-ins, picket-

lines, a few assassinations,
bombings, who knows,
maybecven towall the teach-
ers cars to Halifax, Nova
Scotia.

However, on Monday,
October Ist, there will be a
Semester Forum sponsored
by the S.G.A. in the Morri-
son Room,

Thisis tenativerightnow
since I’m writing this article
on Monday, Sept. 24th -- but
watch for the flyers, they’ ll
have the exacttime and date,

This forum will be like -
the Minus Grades Forum of
last_ year, except that the.

_ teachers haven’ t passed this

new semester yet, and. we
still have time to act.

Don’t let this go the way
of minus grades -- act now
before this plan actually gets
passed, don’t wait until 1992.
