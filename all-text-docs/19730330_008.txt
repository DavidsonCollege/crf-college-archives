SC Captures Four Places in Top Twenty

In a recent edition of Basketball’s Basement, Cor-
nell took first place as the worst team in the nation,
edging the Mountaineers of Appalachian State.

Also representing the Southern Conference in the
top five was VMI, which claimed the number four
spot.

Richmond put on a season-ending rally to cop the
seventeenth position over The Citadel. The Bulldogs
were one spot behind the Spiders.

So four of the eight Southern teams got bids in the
nation’s top twenty...even if it was for the worst twen-
ty.

A Timely Win (d)

Every year the Davidson sailing team races the
Lake Norman Yacht Club in a head-to-head battle for
supremacy of the nearby waters of Lake Norman.

Going into last Saturday's match, the LNYC held a
powerful four-year winning streak.

Now their streak is a thing of the past.

The match is based on the lowest score ac-
cumulated by a team during the seven races. Each
team enters four boats and points are awarded on the
basis of what position the boats finish.

The regatta lasted only two races, however. A slight
problem arose. It is known as the wind.

With Davidson in the lead, the match was ter-
minated because of a lack of wind. Davidson was
awarded the Perpetual Trophy.

The Coach: A Tale Of Irony

Hallam Walker heads up the sailing team. Surely he
was pleased with the win.

But he is also the commodore for the Lake Norman
Yacht Club. It seems he found the way to be both a
winner and a loser.

Perhaps he would see it as a system in which he
cannot lose. He has a point.

Soon he will receive the accustomed dunking of the
coach in the water after a team's victory.

He maybe the first coach to ever lose and still se
the privilege of the victory dunking. °

_ There may even be a !ittié more water this time,
just to rub it in Some more.

Spoils Of Victory

Just this week the sauurs encountered a slight
problem. John Guthrie smashed into Jim Stevenson’s
craft, ripping the fiberglass deck from the bow. It put
the boat out of commission for quite some time.

It is just another spoil that winners encounter.

Lack Of Money

The boat will remain inoperable for a while, due to a
shortage of funds supplied the seamen.

It is unfortunate that winners do not even have the
money to keep their equipment in shape.

“We have to be very happy at
this point of the season.”” said

Davidson tennis coach Jeff
Frank. “We have had some
tough matches and come

through them very well.”

Following a win over MIT
yesterday. the Wildcats have
jumped to a 10-1 mark for the
season. Their only loss came at
the hands of nationally-ranked
UNC

“We are shooting tor the num-
ber one seeding at the con-
ference meet,” said the 28-vear
old Davidson graduate.

David Weaver is pacing the
way for the Cats thus far.
Playing in the number one seed.
he has ammassed a_ strong
record to date

“Weaver is) playing real
well.” said Frank. “Two of the
guys he recently played are
very strong. He had to play a
good game to beat them. I think
he is almost up to the form of
when he won the singles title
last vear.”’

Atter the match against
Amherst Tuesday. Weaver had
a7-2 record.

Kevin Menton is providing
strong play at the second
position. He has compiled a 6-4
mark thus far.

Frank emphasized that there
were two good indicators for the
team as a whole thus far.

First. we are real tough ina
close match,” he commented.
“The only three-set losses we
have suffered were.. to UNC.
This means that we play very
well under pressure.”

“The second key is that we
are very physical since we can
play so well in long matches,"’
he said.

“These two keys are very im-
portant to a coach.’ he con-
tinued. ‘They let me know that
we can be up for our matches
and that we can play well under
most conditions. That is very
important.”

Frank said he thought the
team was getting better as each
match is played.

“The win over Penn State was
the biggest one so far.” he ex-
plained. “They had just beaten
Appalachian State on their
home courts."

Appalachian is one of the top
contenders for the conference
crown this year.

“Penn won by sweeping the
doubles aginst the Moun-
tuineers.” Frank said. ‘‘We
beat them 6-3. as we won five
singles and one of the doubles.”

Frank said that the douk!'es

combination of Weaver and
Maarten Ruys was a “super
doubles team.” They have an 8-
1 record, as of the Amherst
match.

**Bill Allen and Menton are
the toughest at the number two
doubles, but they have not
played together that much,”
Frank commented. ‘‘They will
improve.”

The next doubles slot is the
one that will give the Cats
problems.

‘We just are not getting very
satisfactory play from any
team at the third place yet.”
said Frank. ‘But there are a lot
of possibilities and I will try to
find the best one.”

Allen has an 8-2 record at the
number three singles spot,
following the match with

Amherst. Ruys follows him at
the fourth slot with a 9-1 mark.

Hi Lankenau and Rick Quinby
nail down the last two seeds
with 8-1 and 9-1 slates, respec-
tively.

‘We have had some bad
weather when our schedule has
permitted us a day off.” in-
sisted Frank. ‘“‘We will have
more time to work later as we
play a more spread-out cam-

paign."
