PART OF THAT NUMBER

Four Davidson students tell of their pilgrimage to the Million Man March in een

While most of the nation
viewed the Million Man March
only from aerial photographs in
newspapers, four Davidson stu-
dents traveled to Washington to
participate in the rally.

Called by Minister Louis
Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam,
the march was intended as “a day
of atonement” for black men to
reflect on their roles in their com-
munities. Speakers encouraged
black men to take responsibility
for their actions and fight family
breakdown and social problems.

Damon Colbert ‘98 and three
others marched down Pennsylva-
nia Avenue near the front of the
crowd to the west side of the Capi-
tol. “It was the most peaceful
gathering I have ever seen. It felt
like no other feeling in the world,”
says Colbert.

Another participant, Shakeem
Lane ‘98, agreed that the march
was very orderly and that people
were very friendly with one an-
other. Both mentioned how at one
point, the crowd took three steps
backward together to alleviate con-
gestion near the speaker’s ‘Pla
form.

Colbert called Farrakhan’s
two-hour address “a lecture that

was spiritually and morally uplift-
ing. His message was that black
males need to be better leaders in
ourcommunities. We need to stand
up and take responsibility for our
actions.”

Lane thought that Washing-
ton Mayor Marion Barry and the
Rey. Jesse Jackson were also im-
pressive. “They talked about uni-
fication and self-awareness, and
they wanted black men to recog-
nize their strengths and use them to
their advantage,” he says.

When one speaker called for
the marchers to join hands, Colbert

said, “I turned around, and as far as-

I could see there were black men
holding hands, and then we all
embraced and we prayed. People
told others nearby that they loved
them.”

Colbert believes that although
the march was not.a direct promo-
tion of the National of Islam, “the

- Nation will be entering the politi-

cal arena.” He registered to vote as
an independent at the March.

Both students felt that the Park
Police’s estimate of 400,000
marchers was far too low. “I think
it was more like a million,” said
Lane. Colbert noted, “The media
said the march would never take
place. They didn’t want to report
that it was a million. ButIcan’tsay
it was racist.”

ming and international periodicals
would be available, the Interna-
tional House would provide a re-
laxing atmosphere where students
could learn about -international
events.

According to current plans,
the House would also contain of-
fices for the Dean Rusk Program,
Student Advisory Committee, and
International Student Association.
Portions of the foreign language
department may occupy space in
the building as well.

Ambassador Ken Brown who
is the president of the Dean Rusk
Program, proposed this idea soon
after he arrived at Davidson. “Cur-
rently,” he states, “international
activities are dispersed throughout
the campus. It makes sense to
bring together as many [of these
groups] as possible.”

In addition to the integration
of international interests, the House
would also ease the strain on many
international groups that find them-
selves strapped for space.

Despite a membership of
nearly 150 students, the Interna-
tional Students Association does
not have offices. The Student
Advisory Council, whose offices
are currently located in the Caro-
lina Inn, recently has experienced
difficulty in obtaining meeting
space in the Inn.

The idea of coordinating
Davidson’s international aspects
and interests has been entertained
by both students and faculty for

years. Overtime, as support forss

the plan increased, this desire
evolved into its present plan for an
International House.

Working to propel the Inter-
national House proposition to ac-
ceptance are many individuals and
campus organizations. Ambassa-
dor Brown of the Dean Rusk Pro-
gram has submitted a memo of
support to Dean Williams which is
currently being reviewed by the
Facilities Planning Committee.

The International Students As-
sociation, Student Advisory Com-
mittee, and the Student Govern-
ment Association are active pro-
ponents of the House plan as well.
Berna Demiralp, President of the
International Students Association,
explains that these groups play a
pivotal role in organizing student
support and involvement.

Shelley Rigger, Professor of
Political Science, serves as Fac-
ulty Advisor to the ISA. She em-
phasizes that the “‘initiative. [for
the International House] is coming
from the students,” including the
ISA, SAC, SGA, students working
on international studies concentra-

tions, and students involved inthe ~

foreign language department.

These. groups are planning a
campus-wide petition designed to
assess student support of the Inter-
national House plan. Signatures
will be collected on Wednesday,
October 25 on the ground floor of
Chambers.

Today, the proposed site of
the International House is between
the Davidson town library and the
gas station on Main Street. If the
plan is approved, the building,
which is already owned by the

College, may be moved to a more.

The Million Man March symbolized peace and brotherly love.

Damon Colbert

Colbert was familiar with
Farrakhan’ s ideas before the march.
He said, “Everything Farrakhan
said at the march I agree with. |
share his views.

People take what he says and
put it in different contexts. But
Farrakhan is the leader of the black
community at this time.” Colbert
added that Farrakhan “detested
black racism as well as white rac-

ent perspective on Farrakhan. “I
had many doubts before the march.
I was 100 percent behind the march,
but! was skeptical about Farrakhan.
But I was totally shocked to hear
his speech — people take his com-
ments out of context. The majority
of his speech I.agréed with. But I
can’t say I wholeheartedly stand
behind him.”

None of the marchers from
Davidson is Muslim or a member

“The march was a success,
and its served its purpose,” said
Colbert. “I came out of it a differ-
ent person.” Lane described it as
“the most amazing thing I’ve ever
done, to be a part of something that
large. The peace I felt was out-
standing. It was a life changing
experience.”

All four students are planning
to participate in a panel discussion

The result of the efforts of
