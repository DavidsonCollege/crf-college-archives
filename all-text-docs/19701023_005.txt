Board of Trustees and col-
lege president Samuel R.
Spencer Jr.

To the Editor: .

1 often wonder, what is
the real purpose of Davidson
College? To me, Davidson
College is in existence to
train its: students for com-
passionate, honest andre.
ligious leadership in the com-
munities of men. In light of
this, review the following:

}) Removal of mandatory
two years of R.O.T.C.; a
whole downgrading of a sy-
stem to provide leadership
in times of a national emer-
geney. A  de-emphasis on
one's patriotic duty.

2) A Stated desire toward

Pope Attacks ‘Hypocrisy’ Of Plan:
Davis Hits Infirmary Story’s Error

To The Editor:

It seems to me that the
passing of President Spen-
cer’'s proposal by the

trustees this past weekend

was a rather gross act. of
hypocrisy. Dr. Spencer and
the trustees felt that a fine,
upstanding, and democratic

liberal college such as Da-.

vidson should not support a
selective element on _ its
campus.

The guidelines they estab-
lished for the regulation of
the Social groups on campus
would strangle any ™ selec-
tive fraternity;

Social Council Defended

To The Editor:

After reading last week's
DAVIDSONIAN and the peti-
tion to abolish the big week-
ends that is, now circulating
I felt I had to write this let-
ter. The Union Social Board
has had and will have some-
thing going on every week-
end of this term except this
coming weekend (Oct. 24).

Scott Woodmansee is fil-
ling it in with Mose Henry.
On the first two weekends
of this term there were open
school dances, and there was
Taylor Park.

On ithe tenth there was
Josh White Jr., and last

weekend was .Homecoming.
The thirty-first is concert
weekend with ‘‘Brewer and
Shipley."’

“Your Father’s Mustache”
‘ will make a return visit on
the twenty-first of Noyem-
ber and there will be some-
thing in the bar/Coffeehouse
or a Hungry-D, for the La-
fayette ahd William and
Mary home games.

The Union Film Commit-
tee is bring some very re-
cent films here this term.
There is more going on at
the Union now than ever be-

however, .

Spencer stated this was not

his intention and that he

would welcome any frater-
nity to stay — as long as
they abided by his rules.

The trustees and Spencer
then proceeded to dictate the
rules by which fraternities
could stay at Davidson. Just
to show how far they were
willing to ga to help frater-
nities, they would even al-
low them to move off camp-
us. That is, if they promised
never to eat or sleep in their
own houses,

Not only this, but they
would also help the fraterni-

fore.

The Ad Hoc Committee
wants to do away with big
weekends, but for two dif
ferent and completely op
posite reasons. -

Some of the committee
think they (big”’ weekends)
are bad for the, general stu-
dent’s health because of the
long hours and believe the
social council money could
be better spent on more low-
keyed and mentally stimu-
lating entertainment,
as the. Union is doing on off
weekends now.

The other faction wants

to cut out all the little “‘rin-

ky dink .stuff'’ and concen-
trate on “big name enter-
tainment.”’

There is only one problem.
Do you know what the so-
cial council budget is? It is
the same as it has been for
te last three years, $22,000,
and do you know what big
name entertainment costs?

For a few _ examples:
James Taylor — $7500, Rich-
ie Havens — $8000, Grand
Funk — $10,000, Led Zep-
pelin — $50,000 plus, Three
Dog Night—$20,000, Chicago
— $15,000, Ten Years After

much -

ties rush and set up the re-
gulations regarding rush!
These restriction go on and
on.

If Dr. Spencer wishes to
end fraternities at Davidson,
why does he not just ban
their existence instead of
slowly strangling them by
these restrictions?

It-is also hypocritical for
Spencer to dicate rules for

the eating, sleeping, and so-.

cial life of the students, in
short, to end all free choice
by the student, and then to
excuse these actions by say-
ing they are in line with

$12,000 and CCR — $45,000
plus. :

If the’ frats, (or whatever),
would play down the big
weekend and have ‘more
parties and have them open
as they ‘were last Friday
night or at the Sunday afiter
noon concert. on the — off
weeks, then there would be
something going on both
nights Of every weekend.

If all the college factions
would? work together there
could be something for
everyone. The social council
is trying.

ED. NOTE: Campbell has
apparently misunderstood the
position of THE DAVID-
SONIAN if the remarks in
this letter are intended to
reply to that position (al-
though he may be accurate
with regard to the petition
now in circulation).

For a better understanding
of DAVIDSONIAN policy
Campbell is referred to the
editorial columns of Oct. 9
and 16. and the current
column as well as Paul
Rowland’s columns of Oct.
16 and this week.

To The Editor:

I was heavy into drugs
for. the last three’ years I
was there. Davidson had a
drug problem then, and I'll
wager it has an even big-
ger one now.

If THE DAVIDSONIAN is
admitting that there is a
drug problem among its
students, printing. this let-
ter in ‘‘Letters to the Edi-.
tor” or printing this. mes-
sage may help. Thank you
for helping me to reach
some of those whom I may
have misguided.
