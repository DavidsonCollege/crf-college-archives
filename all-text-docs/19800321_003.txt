Laotian refugees make their way to Davidson

By NANCY McNAIR

On February 14, 1980, as
much of the Davidson Com-
munity anticipated valentines,
members of the Davidson Col-
lege Presbyterian Church Ser-
vice Committee received a more
corporeal symbol of love. A
family of four Laotian refugees
found their way to Davidson
under the committee’s sponsor-
ship. They became the. third
adopted refugee family to join
the Davidson community since
last summer. ie atti

Syma Inthanonh greets his-

reporter-guest with a slight
bow, which his wife Som Mouth
Manivong seconds as their
three year old son grasps her
skirt. Her eleven year old
brother Som Chai grins, a
crayoned paper shamrock pin-
ned to his sweater. Somehow
they appear vaguely out of
place, these Laotians trans-
planted to Lakeside apartments
in Davidson. Yet they also look
as though they already belong,
sitting comfortably on the tai-
lored sofa in their living room.

Syma emerges as the most
confident spokesman of the
family; since he works, he has
more opportunities to practice
his English. His name also
gives him the advantage, as it
proves more approachable to a
lazy Western tongue. Som
Mouth occasionally interjects a
sentence.

“I like Davidson,” declares
Syma. “Davidson is same as
Luang Prabang in Laos. Is
small."’ Between the two of

facts:
Som Mouth have mother in
Arkansas. . . Som Chai in sixth
grade."’ Syma has worked as a
laboratory technician in a clinic,
and Som Mouth as an elemen-

tary school teacher in Laos.
The small talk dissipates
however, because what Syma
really wants to talk about are
the Communists. ‘Laos Com-
munist not good for people,” he
states. ‘Everybody in Laos like |
to escape his home to odder
country. Every people have
been hard work—no rice, no -
medicine when sick. Everybody

must work for. government. —
- They. make rice to send to

Communist Vietnam." .

Som Mouth ‘runs to the
kitchen, returning with two
bags of rice. One says ‘‘sweet
rice” and contains what looks
like cracked grains, the other is
simply long grain rice but in a
larger bag than the usual for
Americans. Som Mouth looks
up a word for the sweet rice in
her Laotian-English dictionary.
The word is ‘“‘glutinous.’’ Ap-
parently the Laotians prefer the
sweet rice, but the new regime
will only allow them to grow the
other kind, and then only gives
them two kilos of that each
month. “If we have chicken,
only have one or two; not have
many; different before,” adds
Syma.

With a family to support,
many of Syma’s complaints
seem to be economic; rampant
inflation in Laos minimized the
worth of his wages: ‘‘My salary
6,000 Kip. Sixteen kilo rice-
10,000 Kip.’’ Som Mouth adds,
and he translates: ‘‘One kilo
meat—2,000 Kip.” Twice the
government devalued the Kip
as well. Displaying the silver
chain about his neck, Syma
indicates that people sold their
possessions to’ buy food.

“When sick—no emergency
—must have village permission
to go hospital. Even if dying.”
He adds, “If you want go to
other towns, must have permis-
sion.”

“For everything— medicine,

food, books, rice—from UNI-
CEF, America, Thai, Japan—
he said from Soviet. No gift—
we must buy.”

Eventually the Communists
separated Syma from his fa-
mily, sending him to Northern
Laos. But he opted for a more
dangerous separation, and re-
counts the tale of how he paid
‘25,000 Kip for permission to
travel from Luang Prabang to
Vientiane. Both Som Mouth
and Syma gesture as though

“holding up*paper money to a

corrupt official.

In terse terms, Syma nar-
rates his escape: ‘‘Because I
don’t like Communists. . .
forty-five minute swim Mekong
River. . . Eight o’clock in night.
. .” He made his. way to a
refugee camp in Thailand, later
working for two American doc-
tors and saving to bring about
the escape of his family. “Is
very expensive for women and

. children (to escape).’’ After five

months in the camp, they
immigrated to the U.S.

Two days after landing in San
Francisco, they found a home in
Davidson.

Mrs. Betty Cumming, an
elder in the church and active
member of the service commit-
tee, described the church’s deci-
sion to aid in refugee relocation:
“Our church has always been in
touch with Church World Ser-
vice. They made a great plea for
sponsors of refugee families,
and we talked about whether we

‘could help in that effort.”

“We decided that we needed
to be able to guarantee to the
refugee family a place to live, a
job for the wage earner, free
medical and dental service,
clothing, household supplies,
food, and help with the lan-
guage.”” Generously, commun-
ity members came to their aid,

the town physicians and den-
tists offering their services,
volunteers preparing to teach
English, and committee mem-
bers assembling collections of
clothing in the proper sizes.

- The committee members un-
derstood the need of the family
to join its larger family. ‘They
left, but we were not cast down

because we felt that we had

given them a good start... .
given them confidence in the
friendliness of Americans,” said

The first refugee family, boat
people from Vietnam but of
Chinese extraction, arrived in
the middle of last summer.
‘‘The Communist regime in
Vietnam had been systematic-
ally persecuting people of Chi-
nese origin,” she said.

The family soon made contact
with an uncle in California and
subsequently joined him. Mrs.
Cumming noted that “‘... There
is a tremendous compulsion
among these people to get
families together." She remem-
bers the wife asking upon
leaving, ‘‘Why in America fami-
ly not live together? Very sorry
to leave but uncle oldest mem-

ber of family. We must obey.” —

Each of the wage earners
found a positon with the David-
son College Grounds Depart-
ment through the efforts of
committee. member Irving
Brawley. “Mr. Brawley, hav-
ing served in Vietnam, was
particularly eager to help,” said
Mrs. Cumming. ‘‘He had seen
such suffering.” we

Under the guidance of Com-
mittee Chairman Anne White,
the group decided to take on
another family, this time Cam-
bodians of Chinese descent, a
young couple with two young
daughters.

‘The Cambodians were al-
most the most pathetic group,”

stated Mrs. Cumming. “There
were two corrupt regimes after
the war, you know, the Pol Pot
and the Khmer Rouge, who
fought each other. The civilians
had taken the brunt of this.
They began sending people far
away from their homes, har-
vests were not planted. . .’’

Struck by the dramatic ele-
ments of these people's lives,
Mrs. Cumming recounted an
incident which occurred in the
waiting room of the doctor's
office:
“The wife picked up a copy ot
Time magazine and saw the
photographs of the boat people.
She saw a picture of a woman
with a dying boy in her arms
and grew excited, saying ‘Me,
me, me!”’

Through a minister who had

learned the language while do-
ing missionary service, they

‘ learned that the woman had lost

her-baby boy when she stepped
on a land mine as she fled. “‘And
there was I, the first person
that she’d been able to tell
about the little boy there in the
doctor's office,’ exclaimed Mrs.
Cumming.
