Being led on by Captain Goodykoontz and
John Currie, track practice at Davidson is
progressing very rapidly. The very spring- |
like weather of last week brought many new |
men out to practice and now there are about |

“I TOOK P. A. for better or worse . . . and
Better than anything I had
ever smoked. That’s my story and I’m going
to stick to it. When siren-brands try to flirt, I
just give them the Frigidstaire. I know what I
like in a pipe, and what I like is Prince Albert!

The instant you break the seal on the tidy red
tin and get that wonderful fragrance of real
tobacco, you know you are in for a pipe-treat.
Your mouth fairly waters for a taste of tobacco
that smells as good as that. Then you load up

Cool. Sweet. Fragrant. Old words, I’ll ad-
mit, but you get a brand-new idea of how much
they can mean in a pipe-bowl packed with P. A.
Maybe you’ve always thought such pipe-plea-
sure was “‘just around the corner.”
of Prince Albert and turn that corner!

P. A. is sold everywhere in
tidy red tins, pound and half.
pound tin humidors, and
pound crystal-glass humidors
with sponge-moistener top.
And always with every bit

of bite and parch removed by
the Prince Albert process.
