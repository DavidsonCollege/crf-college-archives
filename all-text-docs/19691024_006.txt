Opera House, Covent Gar

Hodson Hall on Tuesday
night in the Prokofiev ballet
‘Romeo and Juliet’’ and the
admission charge was only
fifty cents.

Of course, the ballet pre

separate the form from the
content and recognize the
difficulties inherent in mak
ing a film of a ballet. The
problem is analogous to*put

media are separate and dis
tinet each effective, but
neither readily convertible

The reason for placing a
ballet on film in the first
place is that it is then avail
able to people who otherwise
would hot be able to see it.
A second advantage of the
filmed production is its per
