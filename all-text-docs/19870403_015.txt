Psychics reveal predictions for future

Davidson College will go
through many changes in the next
year, ten psychics report. They
have tapped into the soul of the
college and determined, using
their extra-sensory powers, that
the Davidson we all know and
love will be changed forever.
Here’s what they have to say: .-

Elvis will arrive via flying
saucer to give his first live perfor-

_ mance since his tragic death a de-
cade ago. To be held in the 900
Room, his performance will be
shrouded in emotion and many
young coeds will want to join him
in his new life on Jupiter. Priscilla
will be full of rage because he will
not have told her that he was com-
ing. back to give this one-time-

only show.

Shirley MacLaine will die and
take over the body of college pres-
ident John Kuykendall, unbek-
nownst to everyone.. When the
discovery will be made, Missy
Kuykendall will say, “He has
been-acting-strange lately ......-he
wants to pick up ballet and he has

had an unusual interest in Jack
Nicholson.”
Bob Walton will take over as

Dean of Admissions in July after

finally resigning from his position
of Mecklenburg County comis-
sioner. When interviewed, he will
say, “We’re looking for a few
good young men...I mean
people.” Admissions Office
members will be interviewed and
one will say, “I just can’t wait. to
see what’s in his briefcase!”
Dining Service Director
Carleton Pritchard will dicover
the cure to AIDS. He will stumble
across the cure while concocting a
new dish to serve in the Com-
mons. He will still plan to serve
the meal, saying, “Who knows,
maybe it will cure someone, what
with the Gay Support Group and

“all.”

Seven-Eleven will reopen due
to popular demand and outcries
for better convenience store ser-
vice. Activist Rich Link will

» spearhead the movement-te-bring

back the Seven-Eleven, tagged

the “Freedom of Choice Move-
ment.” :
“We wanted to bring back the

Big Gulp and our good friend Bill _

(the manager) ,” Link said.

Chaplin Charlie Summers will
hold a service in which he will fol-
low the lead of a Unitarian minis-
ter in upstate New York, handing
out condoms to parishoners. He
will say, “We have an obligation
to promote safe sex to stop the
spread of AIDS. We consider our-
selves to be academic leaders, so
why can’t we be moral leaders
also?” !

Dean Will Terry will become
a fire-and-brimstone TV preacher
in the Jim Bakker mode. How-
ever, he will promise not to say
that he will die if he does not get
$4.5 million. “I want. to make
poeple get closer to the maker,
dammit.”

So here are the predictions. If

“you don’t like them, too bad, be-

cause they’re all coming true.
Make your plans now.-Consider
yourself forewarned.

Activist Rich Link gets the last Big Gulp at 7-11.
But he knows that they'll be back

Freshman ban extended to 15 weeks

Dean Terry shows his clean

hands

By NEIN T. VON KLAUS

Davidson’s newest council,
the FCC (Freshman Concerns
Council) met last Friday to pro-
pose even newer ways to deal with
incoming freshmen and the new
alcohol laws. Dean of students
Will Terry was heard to have said,
“The class of 1990: was only the
beginning.”

- The council was formed to fol-
low upon some problems that still
exist on campus. Most people
seem to believe that the problems
are greatest in the freshman class,
as they have not yet matured
enough to deal with their new-
found freedom. :

The members of the FCC in-
clude: Terry and his “Deannet-
tes,” Paula Miller and Harriet
‘Root, Dean of Admissions Jim P.
Hendrix, Director of Residence
Life (trans: Housing), Thomas W.
Jennings, Jr., Missy Kuykendall
and her husband John, Chief of
Security Jackie Hughes, Com-
mons Dining Manager Carleton
Pritchard, Union Director Wil-
liam Brown, and three senior
selected by the Dean of Students
Office on the basis of their relative
impartiality because they’re leav-
ing soon and “don’t really care
about next year’s freshman class,
so they'll be less likely to cause a
big fuss about any ‘controversial’

matters that might come up.” (It
was noted that Christopher B.
“Kit” Morris was appointed by the
Dean of Students Office to’ be a
member of the committee. He was
not able to attend because he was

“working on a big plan for the

Athletic Department” as he stated
Thursday.) :

The council broke down, ac-
cording to zodiac sign, into vari-
ous sub-committees to debate new
ways to. “enhance” the Davidson
‘Freshman Experience. The gen-
eral consensus was, “Yeah, sure
this year’s Freshman class is
doing okay, but okay just doesn’t
cut it here at Davidson. We want
real good,” revealed Missy’s hus-
band, John. Their goals were to
get the incoming class “‘so wound
up in themselves that they don’t
even realize there are up-
perclassmen here;” to make al-
cohol something that’s “swilled
only on faculty retreats;” and to
“raise academic averages so high
that USA Today writes a whole ar-
ticle about how smart Davidson
students are.”

The sub-committees debated
for several minutes before coming
up with a unilaterally acceptable
proposal; a 15-week segregation
of freshmen and Patterson Court.
“Five weeks just ain’t enough,”
said Terry.

An interesting proposal. came
from Hughes: starting a Davidson
Bureau of Investigation (DBI) to
curb vandalism on freshmen halls.
“It would be really neat,” he ges-
ticulated excitedly. “The ‘D-men’
would get to’wear trench coats
with the collars up and those re-
flecting sunglasses, so no one
would know for sure what they
were looking at. Of course, they’d
be undercover so they’d have to
wear really sharp Italian designer
suits in mauve and melba and
they’d have to carry around ID
cards with badges that they could
flash whenever they wanted any
information from anyone. They'd
monitor all activity in the
freshman halls with new tracking
systems. The Cushmans would
have to go, though. No one would
take the D-men seriously if they
rode around in Cushmans.”

- Jennings said the idea was “in-
teresting,” but was concerned by
the fact that suit attire required
ties. “I think that would be an un-
fair mandate.” When asked
“Why?” he replied, “No com-
ment.” Terry and the Deannette
sub-committee thought that the
idea “has possibilities, but at the
present time our office is quite
capable of handling any problems
on the freshmen halls.” .

. The proposal for D-men was
voted down. “It’s just too ex-
treme,” commented Missy.
“These kids are all pretty good.
They’re still just adjusting to-col-
lege life.”

Finally, Brown and Pritchard
both brought to the council’s at-
tention the fact that “someone will
have to do something with the
freshman. We-can’t just let them
hang out in the Commons and the
Union all the time.” Terry moved
the majority of the responsibility
fall on the hall counselors’ shoul-
ders. “After all, there are 82

sophomores applying: Why not.

have some applicants that don’t
make it form the Freshman Fun
Committee (FFC) to help out?”
Everyone loved this idea. “Noth-
ing like having a committee ‘in
charge of campus activities,”
agreed Brown.

Monday, the FCC presented
its 15-week proposal to the admin-
istration and faculty for a vote. It

John Elster

passed by a landslide. The propo-
sal then went to the Trustee board :

at their monthly meeting Wednes-
day. It stopped there; however.
The board felt unsure about pas-
sing any policy too quickly. All
debate was postponed until late
May. “We’ll have. a better feel of
the situation then,” stated Chair-
man Ben T. Craig.
