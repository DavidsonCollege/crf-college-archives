AGAIN, THE CHAMELEON

(Editor’s Note. In view of recent
criticisms of The Chameleon appear-
ing in this paper, we are publishing
criticisms appearing in magazines froin
other colleges. The references here
are to the October issue of the mag-
azine.)

The Coraddi (N. C C. W.): “The
October number of The Chameleon is
one of the most versatile magazines
that we have read. In prose and in
verse there is admirable variety and
range. “The Star of Death” is a most
interesting story; in atmosphere the
author reaches enviable effects. The
oriental wedding feast which ends in
the death of the “foreign devil” by
means of the weird, mystifying star if
the climax to a well executed piece of
writing. “The Free-Lance” and “If I
Could Write” possess atmospheres of
reality. In a lighter vein, “His Period
of Training” and “La Philosaphie Con-
temporaine de Davidson” are delight-
fully absurd. We congratulate The
Chameleon on its general content and
make-up.”

The Concept (Converse): “The
Chameleon for October has four in-
teresting short stories. “The Star of
Death” has the sureness of touch that
comes with knowledge. The Chinese
scenes encountered by the American
representative of the American and |
British Tobacco Company could only
have been written by one who knew
the country.

The satire of “La Philosophie Con-
temporaine Americaine de Davidson”
is very lively. It justifies its claim to
“present a few of the many philosophi-
cal thoughts contained in the Davidson
Credo.

There is nothing striking about the
various poems, but they are uniformly
good.” ;

Mary Baldwin Miscellany:
publication which holds our highest
esteem at this time Davidson’s
Chameleon, The October issue is rich
in material—it presents a broad per-
spective and its variety is appreciated.
The mere outward appearance of The
Chameleon suggests charm and dignity
The author of “The Star of Death”
presents his far eastern story in a very
authentic and realistic manner. He ev-
idently has first-hand ‘knowledge of the
situations he presents. The bulesque
tone of “La Philosophie Contemporaine
de Davidson” refreshing. “If T
Could Write’—truly this “would-be
poet composer” of this diary has a
poetic soul that enables him to express
so beautifully his love of nature.
There are numerous other interesting
stories, articles, and that we
should like to discuss, Indeed, this is-
sue of The Chameleon is one of real
merit and warrants our sincere admir-
ation.”

A REPLY TO “CASTE OF
TRADITION

An editorial, entitled “Caste of Tra-
dition,” apeparing in the last issue of
The Davidsonian has, believe, a
mistaken idea of things. Most de-
cidedly, we are not one of those who
would hold on to traditions just be-
cause they are traditions. There are
many traditions we would like to have
the privilege of dynamiting. But we
do not agree with the author of the
above mentioned editorial in his view
that the of promience on
the campus, more especially the editors
of the publications, should, in case of
lack of good material in the senior
class, be chosen from the Junior class.

In the first place, these positions are
not based on the merits of the men,
but. for the most part, on popularity.
Any change, would only mean that
any men of greater talent be honored.
class would be chosen, and not that
nay men of greater talent be honored.
The student body, which elects these
various offices, has very little idea of
individual abilities. And would, no
doubt, pay only minor attention toa
man’s ability anyhow, Popularity, per-
sonality—these are the attributes on
which a man is voted into such an of-
fice as editor of Quips and Cranks,
The Davidsonian, etc.

we

positions

The writer cites cases of large uni-
versities choosing men of the lower
classes for such positions, And in a
large university, we believe, this plan
would work, ‘You select your editor
from what you have read by him—pos-
sibly not knowing him by sight. Here,
you vote for the man with the heart-
iest greetings, the man most friendly
in bull sessions. You know your man
personally. ’ ‘

' The Senior class is, by tradition,
common sense, or what have you, the
- class on which most responsibility is

- placed, and should be. If, at any time,

talent of amazing superbness be found
in the Junior class as contrasted with
a decided lack of talent, among the
Seniors, then we agree—traditions
should not be too binding. The pres-
ent basketball situation is just such a
case, Traditions didn’t seem to bother
the basketball men last year. Tradi-
tions shouldn't, necessarily, keep the
editor of The Davidsonian among the
Seniors. But don’t make it a_tra-
dition to have the editor among the
Juniors or Seniors. In rare cases,
only, we say—waive traditions. Let
common sense rule.

Yellow Springs, Ohio—(IP)—Philip
C. Nash, dean of Antioch College for
the past eight years, has been appoint-
ed executive director of the League of
Nations Association with headquar-
ters-at New York. He takes up his
new duties January 1.
Nash succeeds Charles C. Bauer, for-
merely of Springfield, Ohio, who be-
comes vice-president of the a$socia-

New City Found
Backtchisaram, Crimea—(IP)—The
ruins of a great city, the origin of
which is not known, have been dis-
covered in the Eski-Kermen valley in
the heart of the Crimean peninsula.
The ruins are said to extend for

pore than two miles, and consist of

high fortress walls, hundreds of homes
hewed out of rocks and six great cave
temples, decorated with ancient fres-
coes.

Russian archeologists claim the
ruins were once the capital of the
Goth kingdom, known in history as
the city of Feodora, founded during
the reign of Justinian the Great.

More Land to Texas A

Austin, Texas—(IP)—Texas, already
the largest state in the Union, is to be
25,000 acres larger when the United
States Supreme Court issues its final
decree’ in the Texas-Oklahoma_ boun-
dary dispute.

About that amount of land, valued at
from $25 to $75 an acre, will be added
to Texas because the court has found
that the true tooth meridian, the legal
border of western Oklahoma, and
the eastern border of the Texas pan-
handle, really takes in part of what is
now Oklahoma.

The court ordered a commission. to
establish the true line, which will swing
east of the present one. It will’cut off
a large, wedge-shaped section of Ok-
lahoma, the big end being at the Red
River, south boundary of Oklahoma.
Oklahoma’s jurisdiction will be ex-
tended to the south low banks of the
Red River,

Unusual Record by Boren

Los Angeles—(IP)—The University
of Southern California had a versa-
tile football player in tne person of
Charley Boren, who played his last
game for the Trojans against Notre
Dame. Boren will be graduated next
June with the honor of having starred
at three positions on the eleven, in do-
ing which he proved himself one of
the most efficient players in Southern
California football history. He played
one year as halfback, one as an end,
and one as a running guard. In ad-
dition, he ‘has a splendid scholastic
record.

Big Game Okayed

Kansas City (IP)—A New Year's
football game in Dallas, Texas, be-
tween an all-Big Six senior team, and
an all-Southwedt conference senior
eleven, has been approved, the profits
to go for the benefit of crippled chil-
dren. Big Six conference athletic di-
rectors and faculty representatives
meeting here approyed the venture.
The game will not effect the eligibility
of the players for other sports this

a proposal to levy a 3 per cent tax on
all professional sport gate receipts.

In fact, the ,promoters stated, they
have been losing ‘money.

William Veek, president of the Chi-
cago National League Baseball Club

Flu Back With Us .

Elyria, Ohio—(IP) — Colleges and
universities throughout the middle-
west. found it expedient to close their
doors early for the Christmas vaca-
tion this year because of the flu epi-
demic which swept the country.

Curiously enough it was exactly ten
years ago that the first flu epidemic
struck the nation—and the world, al-
though the first epidemic was of a
much more serious nature, ending in
many more fatalities. This year’s flu
was of a mild nature, hardly distin-
guished in most cases from a hard
cold,

Bernadotte, nephew of King Gustav
V, of Sweden, who was initiated into
the game at the contest between Geor-

“The game is played with the hands,”
he said. “But it’s a nice, pleasant
sport, and not so rough.”

His bride of a few days, the former
Estelle Romaine Manville, of Pleas-
antville, N. Y., and President M. L.
Brittain, of Georgia Tech, explained
the technicalities of the game to him.

Syracuse Student Found

Syracuse, N. Y.—(1P)—Kendall B.
Hassard, Syracuse university junior and
assistant manager of the Syracuse foot-
ball team, Was found at Columbus, Ohio
more than a week after he disappeared:
from the campus here.

The youth was recognized from descrip-
tions by a policeman to whom he appealed
for aid,

Hassard told reporters that his mind
went blank as he was climbing “Piety
Hill” on which Syracuse University is
located, about 9:30 the night of Dec. 4.
He had gone for a walk, he said, eating
medicine tablets for a headache which
bothered him, The next thing he knew
he was on a railroad coach approaching
Pittsburgh. He arrived in Columbus the
next day. He had forgotten his identity,
and appealed to a detective for aid.

He first remembered who he was when
his mother came to him, police said.

Club Causes Dispute
Pittsburgh, Pa.—(IP)—University of
Pittsburgh authorities and the Liberal
club of the university have been in two
controversies within two weeks.

The first was over the recent appear-
ance of Professor Scott Nearing, former
member of the faculty, as lecturer before
the club. The latest was in connection
with the alleged censorship of placards,
posted on campus bulletin boards, adver-
tising the appearance of Atty. Arthur
Garfield Hayes of New York City, coun-
sel for the Civil Liberties Union, who was
scheduled to address the club.

Club members also said they had sug-
gested the name of Clarence Darrow as
a jspeaker before the club, but the issue
of an invitation to Darrow had been for-

bidden by university heads.

Clash G.s From Everywhere

Butler University—(CNC).
consisting of about 1,000 books, many of
them very valuable, has been donated to
Butler University by Mrs. Austin J.
Denny. Mr. Denny was a graduate of old
North-western Christian University in
1862.

More Women

‘(By CNC)—Enrollment in American
colleges and universities has increased 25
per cent in the last five years according
to figures compiled from all institutions
approved by the Association of Ameri-
can Universities. The figures show that
the larger the school the larger the gain
in enrollment.

The largest colleges exclusively for
women are, in order of size; Hunter Col-
lege, Smith College, Wellesley, Simmons,
Vassar, Goucher, Mt. Holyoke, Radcliffe,
to over four thousand.
and Randolph-Macon Women’s College.
The number vary from under a thousand

The largest number of women in co-
educational schools are in those of Cali-
fornia, Winconsin, Illinois, Minnesota, and
Michigan.

Those Good Old Days

University—(CNC)—with
$1.75 a week, the Syracuse student 15
years ago could livé in luxury, according
to statistics compiled in those days be-
fore the war. Then a student could hit
a joint near the college, consume a small
steak for a nickel and top it off with ice
cream for three cents more.

If he was really flush, he could have a
porterhouse for 20 cents. A special Sun-
day rate for roast chicken was a quarter,
chicken a-la-kin being a dime.

University of Texas—(CNA)—The
deepest hole ever drilled into the earth,
according to university geological officials
is in the Big Lake field in Reagan country,

Texas.

The well has reached a depth of 8,523
feet, and is producing 500 barrels of

Freshmen Try Hard
Oxford, Ohio—(1P)—The flu epidemic
which has been closing up colleges and
universities throughout the middle-west
has reached the campus of Miami. univer-
sity and brought with it a wave of fresh-
man tomfoolery, ,

Learning that the university hospital
Was overcrowded and that several col-
leges in the mid-west had closed, Miami
students were on a spree of pretended ill-
ness.

A few have already been sent home be-
cause of overcrowding at the hospital,
and many others, envious of those who
were sent home to enjoy an extra week
of Christmas vacation, mobbed the uni-
versity clinic, hoping that something would
be found wrong with them.

Persistent rumors circulated the cam-
pus that classes would be dismissed early
if the situation failed to improve.

Emphatic denials, however, were given
out by President A. H. Upham, who aver-
red that nothing but an earthquake could
shake him from hfs determination to keep
classes going.

An entire freshman dormitory paraded
to the hospital for an examination, after
having employed every conceivable meth-
od of assuming symptoms of influenza.

Freshmen at Fisher hall were reported
to be practicing violent coughing. Others
were wearing blotters in their shoes, and
rubbing moist tobacco in their arm pits
preparatory to going for an examina-
tion at the hospital. Someone told them
they could in that way raise their tem-
perature to a fever point.

One freshman shook his head violent-
ly to acquire a headache. Then he hur-
ried over to the clinic for an examination
but received headache pills, not a vaca-
tion.

Walking Straight

Vienna—(CNA)—How to be a pe-
destrian, is the latest school subject being
taught in Vienna. The growing number
of street accidents induced the authorities
to make the laws of the traffic and of the
street a separate branch of education.

The pupils will be taught by practical
demonstrations and visits to public build-
ings, how to walk, cross the street and
how. to avoid the dangers of modern
traffic.

Field Work

University of Chicago—(CNC)—The
procedure known as “getting too fresh”
was advanced by Herton O, Phillips, 2
post graduate student at the University
of Chicago, as one way of earning a col-
lege degree.

Several young women complained that
Phillip had been bold to the point of im-
pudence and insult. Arrested, he explain-
ed that he was engaged in a special study
leading to the degree of doctor of philos-
ophy.

Strange Definitions

University of Chicago—(CNA)—A
lot of graphic American words, now
frowned on by the juries are going to at-
tain respectability in 15 or 20 years thru
the offorts of Professor William A.
Craigie of the English department of the
University of Chicago.

Such words as “baloney”, and “gang-
ster” will be put into the historical dic-
tionary now being compiled by Professor
Craigie.

He has finished the first step in going
through three centuries of American pa-
pers to find when these typical words first
appeared.

In 15 or 20 years when you pick up
his dictionary, you will come across many
words recognized as being part of the
language that are not heard in the best
drawing rooms now.

For instance there will be “Baloney; a
term signifying propaganda, baldhash or
untruth,  Originiated in 1922 by Rube
Goldberg, cartoonist.

“Bootleg” will be defined as illicit al-
coholic beverage,

first perfectly good book, “high hatted

CAT TRAX

With spring football starting
February first and track already
under way, only the players of the
hickory stick and old familiar
horsehide need to be accounted
for. Baseball practice will begin
earlier than usual this spring. We
believe this is to be Davidson’s big
year in the great sport. Good
material is on deck for infield and
éuter gardens, and with McInnis,
Kugler, Meadows, Henderson and
Thompson to serve them up, we
look for a big time when Cousin

Rube Brandon yells “Play Ball.”

Co-Ed Cow-Girls

University of Texas—(CNA)—Rid-
ing down the bridal path has again become
popular at the University of Texas. More
than 50 co-eds have enrolled in the horse-
back riding classes conducted by Miss
Helen Hall of Eden, uniyersity senior and
proficient cowgirl.

She induced the faculty to establish the
course as a regular part of the physical
culture work and give the co-eds credit
for horsebackriding.

COSMIC CHAOS

(Continued from Page 2)
passed since the mob “thumbs uped or
thumbs dwon” in the Circus Maximus.

Unknown to most of the students
of the college, a strange and pictures-
que figure has been seen roaming the
campus during the wee small hours.
Hat brim pulled low, a plaid scarf, coat
collar raised above his ears, he shuns
conversation, hall Davidson be
siezed in the midst of a baffling mys-
tery? Or is it some fellow class-
mate returning from the Great Un-
known? Some have suggested the
modern ghost of the skeleton supposed
to be i none of the columns. Further,
perhaps he has escaped from Flynn’s
Weekly. Who knows?

In Heroes and Hero Worship, Car-
lyle ably discusses the true feeling to-
ward a national or international figure
who holds the admiration of the world.
Along with brave men of the past
ranks Marshal Foch, hero of the Ar-
gonne, perhaps the greatest battle in
history, In his home in Paris, the fam-
ous soldier is waging his last fight. A
man of the sword, he will draw the at-
tention of great men of the pen by
his death. Yet he will die with a smile
on his lips, “Vive la France.”

HOTCHPOT

(Continued from Page 2)
He marries early; his family usually
runs from three to five children.
He is a ready believer, inclined to
swallow the pretty promises of quack
doctors in medicine, in politics, in reli-
gion, and.so on.
He does not allow his limited knowl-
edge -to make him hesitant in his
opinions; he will speak dogmatically
about anything from cancer to’ the
League of Nations.
And yet democracy must depend on
him!
