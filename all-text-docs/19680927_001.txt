From the window in the office of the president
of Davidson College, you can't see far. Shrubbery

blocks the view.

“ And for the new man inside the office, it is also

‘ bard at this point to see far into the college’s fu-
ture. His novelty limits his viston.

“lam very new here,” Dr. Samuel R. Spencer

Jr. says. ‘There are sv many things about Davidson

College I don't know
enough about to be
pontificating on yet. 1
don’t want to cross

} are, and I don’t want
to prejudice what any
of us might do about
sensitive areas before.

He reels off a list of his own—some of the

college's role with the disadvantaged of the region.
“We cannot be a provincial college. We must try to
broaden cur outlook through our personnel, both
student and faculty. And I am interested in trying
to define the responsibility the college has to help
in the bootstrap operation for the disadvantaged."
