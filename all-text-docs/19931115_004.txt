Economist blasts gove

By Wendy Lee |.

“Charity is very noble, but
theft is not good,” was one way
that Dr. Walter Williams illustrated
that American government is steal-
ing from some citizens to provide
for others. Americans are slowly
approaching “serfdom” to govern-
ment.

Dr. Williams, John M. Olin
Distinguished Professor of Eco-
nomics at George Mason Univer-
sity in Fairfax, Virginia, presented
a speech Wednesday, November
10 at 8:30 in the Chambers Gallery
entitled “Legitimate Role of Gov-
ernment in Free Society.”

Williams labeled taxes “gov-
ernment claims on private prop-
erty” and noted that as time goes
by, citizens own less of what they
produce.

Each year an American will
work from January 1 to May 8 to
cover the federal, state, and local
taxes he or she will pay that year.
Williams was concerned that
Americans don’t have the right to
define how the fruits of their labor
are used.

Williams claimed that Ameri-
can government commits “legal
theft” and “organized rape” by tak-
ing something from a citizen and
giving ita citizen towhom it doesn’t
belong. He rejected the terms “in-
come redistribution” or “transfer
payments,” referring to them as
“theft.”

Williams spoke candidly with
the audience of students, faculty,
and guests, saying that the “no-
blest and most enriching charac-
teristic of a person is greed” or
“trying to get more for yourself.”
By pursuing one’s own self inter-
est, one helps future generations.

He lauded the rise of capital-
ism because it has brought with it
better treatment of women and ra-
cial minorities and has brought out
a morality in people.

Williams took several ques-
tions from audience members and
stressed that he believes that gov-
ernment can be reduced to a lim-
ited form. He underscored the idea
that Americans have given up so

Students may have wondered
what has happened to student-pro-
jduced programming on Channel
14.. According to junior Andy
Cole, DCTV director, DCTV
should be more active next spring.
Many students have ‘seen
DCTV’s current efforts displayed
in the Pit of the Union, where a

study breaks, ee
often humorous creations. Even
though these two efforts appear
to be successful, Cole looks for-
ward to next semester, when he
plans to have regular program-
ming on Channel 14. °

DCTV will plug into an ing

Walter Willimas addressed the role of government in a free
society in the Gallery Wednesday night.

many liberties that the founding
fathers bestowed upon them.

Addressing the issue of higher-

education, he noted that universi-
ties should not try to solve society’s
problems butshould focus on trans-
mitting education from one gen-
eration to the next.

He said that much of today’s
ethnicconflict on college campuses
was a result of policies such as
quotas.

Williams spoke out against
several current government pro-
grams. He said that an important
question that must be asked when
offering government aid is, “What
is my effect in helping this person
on his incentive to help himself?”

‘He said that America has the

best medical care system in the
world and doesn’t need socialized
medicine. He also pointed out that
national health care is not pro-
vided for in the Constitution.

Social Security is immoral, he
noted, because young people will
pay thousands of dollars in and
won’t see any money in return. He
theorizes that this will cause class
conflict between young and old.
Pointing to a Davidson College
student, Williams said that to break
even with what you will have paid
into Social Security, “you'll have
to live to be 96.” "

Williams talk was co-spon-
sored by the Young America’s
Foundation and the Union Speak-
ers Committee.

Bone marrow drive aims to add 300 to registry

Marrow continued from page 1

National Registry. Project Life
works in conjunction with the Char-
lotte Red Cross.

The process of typing a
person’s bone marrow is a simple,
painless procedure, entailing only
a small blood sample. The sample
is then taken to a medical labora-
tory to be typed for major antigens.
The National Marrow Registry
stores the lab results and performs
‘searches on behalf of patients in
‘need of transplants.

A potential donor is not re-
quired to give their marrow if it
matches, but as McEaddy says,
“It’s not every day you get achance
to save a life.”

The odds of finding a marrow
match within a victim’s family are
1 in 100, however these odds de-
crease to a 1 in 1,000,000 chance
for a victim who must rely on the
Registry for a match. Each addi-
tional name placed on the Registry
increases the odds for a match.

Davidson College has a direct

connection to the Bone Marrow
Drive. Three students have re-
ceived bone marrow transplants
either from a relative or the Na-
tional Registry: David Lindsay,
John Ramey, and Stephen Keller.
Junior Megan Snyder and gradu-
ate Julie Ferguson, whose names
were placed on the Registry
through Davidson’s bone marrow
drive, were exact matches and were
chosen to be marrow donors.
“The bone marrow drive is the
most amazing opportunity to give
alife. Nobody should be denied a

bone marrow transplant when there
is someone out there that has a
potential match. Putting their name
on the Registry is potentially giv-
ing someone that gift of life,”
McEaddy remarked.

Each laboratory typing costs
$60, paid by Davidson's Project
Life through fundraisers and dona-
tions. Because of the need for
minority volunteers, the Red Cross

does not charge for their labwork.

Davidson has raised $30,000 for
this year's drive. After the drive,
the focus turns tomore fundraising.

BONE MARROW DRIVE

10:00 a.m.-4:00 p.m.
Wednesday, November 17
Morrison Room

The first 300 volunteers will be typed for free. The
typing involves only a short time and a small sample of
blood.

Please have yourself typed and put on the registry. You
could save someone's life.
