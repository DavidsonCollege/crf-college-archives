your dime?”

Kid—"No, but me brudder found it.”

Old Lady—*Then what are you still

Kid—"I'm lookin’ for me brudder now.”

“No, I just promised to meet a fresh-

“How much are you worth?”

“I'm worth $2,000 in New Mexico.”

“How's that?”

“The sheriff out there is offering it.”

A FAIRY TALE
The Scotchman was so tight he paid
for the drinks.
“When did you get the funny valen-

“That's not a valentine; it’s my girl's
picture.”

A man who waists his time cannot ex-

Again, suppose one said he saw someone |

and see what happens.

So is the difference in the effect of the
word in the two above statements just as
marked. Thus we say, repeating the first,
that “reading a book” means—taking it all
in, devouring it, getting all the good it can
supply and hence gaining its full value.

The second is merely gaining some ad-
vantage from the book, having a background
in which to find certain things and support
certain ideas but full value is not
realized or absorbed. Absorbed —that's the
real idea. Lack of absorption has caused
many a serious disaster in college life. Has
it caused one in yours? Few escape its toils.
