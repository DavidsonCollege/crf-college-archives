The Result: 2nd Richardson
lost six yards but the powerful
Emanon only lost five to take
the victory.

There was also an overtime
game played by two ‘‘fresh-
man” girls’ teams. It was
equally listless. 1st and 3rd
Watts battled to a 0-0 tie for
two halves, as neither team
seemed able to score (painfully
typical for Davidson coeds).

Led by the aggressive Van
“I collect athletes’ William-
son and the good hands of
Wildcat trainer Leea Pittenger
(ask any football player with a
groin injury), 1st Watts strut-
ted to the win on a quick four
downs. 3rd Watts’ standout
Sabine Kelischek said to: these
reporters, “They had the hor-
ses, we had the cows.”’

The Harlem Shufflers have
had a rough schedule to date
and the results reflect it. They
have lost twice, both times

to powerful teams.

In other action, Emanon
lengthened its unpresidented
winning streak to two as they
defeated 2nd Richardson in a
heart-stopping overtime con-
test. At the end of regulation
time the score stood at 18-all.

provide consistency,’’ said
Chairman of the Plunge
project Andy Lamas. Stu-
dents divided into teams of
two to interview the many
principals and PTA presi-
dents.

Although the study was
quite intense, students did
have free time at night and on
the weekends to do as they
liked. ‘‘The close personal
relationships that developed
were an added bonus,” said
English.

The students, as well as Dr.
Ruth, stayed at the guest
house of Morris-Brown Col-
lege, a part of Atlanta Univer-
sity, in the heart of downtown
Atlanta. ‘‘It was a dorm-type
situation with everyone hav-
ing a roommate,’’ stated
English.

Dr. Ruth’s role in the pro-
ject was not as the leader who
made the decisions for the
students; rather, he was mere-
ly a consultant and advisor.

“Dr. Ruth had been work-
ing with Washington, D.C.
and New York City schools,”
said English.

“He gave practical advice
and helped to draw up the
interview questions. He
warned us about what areas
might be sensitive to the
people we interviewed so we
would best know how to
handle the interview. He was

really not the leader; .the
project was a group effort.”

Students in the Plunge pro-
ject had the option of receiving
academic credit for their
participation. “About fifty
percent of the participants
elected to receive credit,’’ sta-
ted Lamas.

“They could choose to be
graded on a pass-fail basis or
by letter grade,”’ he added.

Summarizing her experi-
ence, English said, ‘‘The pro-
ject was very worthwhile. It
was basically a lesson in city
government politics and how
blatantly political the admini-
stration in a school system
is.

Lamas considers the value

of the project to be the
experience of ‘‘walking
through a proposal.’’

According to Dr. Ruth, a
copy of the final draft of their
paper, now being composed,
with their results and recom-
mendations will be sent to the
Charlotte Observer, the Char-
lotte News, and the Atlanta
Council for Public Education.

When the final draft of the
Atlanta. Plunge project paper
is finished, Wood, Dr. Ruth
and members of the Plunge
team will make a_ general
evaluation of the project and
offer suggestions as to how
future related projects might
be improved.
