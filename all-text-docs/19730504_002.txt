The Senate passed a
resolution calling for the de-
subsidization of Davidson
College inter-collegiate football
in its meeting this week

The resolution was proposed
by Steve Bell, who attended the
recent athletic conference at
Montreat. Bell said that “‘de-
subsidized football would save
money" according to what he
had learned.

“IT personally am in favor ot
de-subsidization of football and
basketball,”’ Bell said

‘However. I don't think there
is a chance for the de-
subsidization of basketball.
now. There is for football. I'm
willing to work on one thing at a
time,” he said.

Steve Dodd. a student
representative to the Faculty
Educational Policy Committee
(EPC). reported to the Senate
on the revision of the drop-add
period. Dodd said that current

plans are for reducing the drop
period to about five days and
extending the add period for
about a half of a day more.

“This is because students
have been failing to drop cour-
ses early enough for other
students to pick them up.”’

Miles Ward, another student
representative to the EPC said,
“This is an attempt to keep
people from getting locked out
of the courses they need.”’

Dodd said that the basic idea
was to make the add period
longer than the drop period.

The Senate passed a motion to
show their disapproval of a drop
period of less than 10 days

Amendments concerning the
Union Board and the Social
Council were passed in
Tuesday's meeting. The Senate
also. passed an amendment
placing the Dorm Social Council
under the direction of the Union
Board instead of the Senate

Union Seeks Future Quarters

By PAUL WELCH
Staff Reporter

The student Union is present-
ly studying a number of alter-
natives to its present temporary
quarters in the old Guest House.

However the Union will
probably continue to be located
in the Guest House building for
at least two more years, ac-
cording to Union’ Board
President Joe Earle.

Speaking of the search for
new quarters, Earle said,
“What we are talking about
here is a six to ten year interim
period during which we hope to
be located in another already
existing building here on cam-
pus.

“Hopefully. by the end of that
period. the school will have the
money necessary for the con-
struction of a new Union
building,”’ Earle remarked

The present Union building is
considered inadequate because
of its small size and also
because it lacks several
features usually considered
essential in a Union, such as a
cafeteria service.

Accordingly, the Union Board
has appointed a special com-
mittee to study the possibilities
of using several other college
buildings as interim sites for
the Union facilities.

The committee. in turn, has
been divided into several
smaller groups, each of which
is studying the advantages and
disadvantages of a particular
location.

The sites which are presently
being considered are the
present Cunningham Fine Arts
Building (to be used together
with the present temporary
Union building), the Laundry-
Heating Plant complex! the
present library, and the gym-
nasium.

Committee members have
been given access to the floor-
plans of all these buildings, and
are now preparing reports on

the suitability of each of them
for Union operations.

Criteria for suitability include
floor space and the degree of
ease with which sucn tacilities
as Offices for the various cam-
pus organizations and
publications, game rooms,
meeting rooms, a post office.
and others could be set up

Another criterion would be
the ease with which the present
occupants of a building might
be installed in other facilities

Once the committee reports

have come in and _ been
evaluated by the Union Board,
the board will submit a recom-
mendation to the = _ ad-
ministration as to which
building it believes would make
the best Union.

“Of course,”’ said Earle, the
administration may choose not
to follow that recommendation.
but so far the reaction has been
encouraging.

The deadline for submission
of committee reports to the

board is May 9.
