something Offends You? Just Change It!

By Philip Atchison

What this campus needs is
more multiculturalism. Sure, you
say, thatsounds great. Butdoesn’t
Davidson have students with dif-
ferentcultural heritages? Ofcourse
we do. We-have international stu-
dents from every pointon the globe.
We have Asians of American de-
scent and African Americans.

Obviously Davidson College is.

home to a multiplicity of cultures.
What then, if any, was the point to
a Davidsonian article published
several weeks ago entitled
“SERCH Fosters Multiculturalism
in Davidson?”

Itseems that a group of twenty-
five students has been founded,
Students interested in Establishing
Racial and Cultural Harmony. The
article stated that the founder of
the group received his inspiration

after attending aconference where
“he was introduced to the idea of
multiculturalism.” The group has
already brought a speaker to the
campus, an “advocate of multicul-
turalism.” Perhaps there is a con-
fusion of terms here. I certainly
hope so, because the “‘multicultu-
ralism” that I am aware of has no
place at school with the reputation
of Davidson.

In today’s classrooms and
courtrooms, multiculturalism is a
misnomer. It is an idealistic term
that circumscribes a radical set of
Afrocentric beliefs. Educational
programs have been instituted in
numerous public schools, flaunted
as multiculturalism, but filled with
half truths and myth. In 1982 an
educational system was installed
in the public schools of Portland,
Oregon. This system was drawn

directly from a work titled the
“African-American Baseline Es-
says.” These essays were devel-
oped by AsaG. Hilliard, an educa-
tional psychologist from Georgia
State University (this professor
now claims that the Greek gods
and the Ten Commandments also
originated in black culture). These
essays have been and. will be used
as standards for setting up “multic-
ultural educational systems” in
Atlanta, Indianapolis, and Wash-
ington D.C. (Following specific
information courtesy of CHAL).
Africa was “the world center
of culture and learning in antiq-
uity.” “Since Africa is widely
believed to be the birthplace of the
human race, it follows that Africa
was the birthplace of mathematics
and science.” These ideas are
prevalent in the Baseline Essays.

The concept that ancient Egypt
was a Black empire is also a preva-
lent theme running throughout the
Essays. This documentasserts that
Egyptians were black, but Europe-
ans ‘invented the theory of ‘white’
Egyptians who were merely
browned by the sun.” One visit to
the Ancient Egyptian wing of the
British museum of Art, and this
assertion becomes laughable.
Incredibly enough, I have seen
more than one Davidson student
wearing a t-shirt, black with gold-
lettering, reiterating much of the
crap included in the Baseline Es-
says. Are these students propo-
nents of “multiculturalism”? Ei-
ther these Essays are fiction, or the
curriculum at Davidson Coilege
has been based on racially moti-
vated lies for the past 154 years.

Depth! Relevance!
Ain't That Gromantic?

A full, rich childhood always
proceeds the development of adeep
andrelevantconsciousness. A child
must learn to observe the world --
see how objects move or remain
inert, how people think, how to fry
bees with WD-40 and a match --
without losing an eye in the proc-
ess.

One member of The Society
recalls his family gerbil, the loyal
and constant companion of his
youth, and has agreed to tell his
story for this week’s feature: Les-
sons From Innocence and Experi-
ence.

“Member: We had many ger-

bils growing up, but my favorite

was the first. I loved him (I think it
was a him) and fed him Nerds, his
favorite were the green ones, and
dad used to make little frisbees out
of tiddly-winks for him to chase.
We named him after his favor-
ite relatives, Aunt Nancy and Uncle
Bud (they rescued him asan infant
from his mother when they real-
ized she was about to eat him).
He’d just about spin his wheel off
its stand when they visited. We
called him “Nud” so everyone

‘would be happy.

D/R:. What a beautiful ex-
ample of thoughtful compromise
inaction. How valuable this expe-
rience musthave been for you. Too
bad we so rarely encounter such
considerate thinking in the world

today. Weren’t your relatives ©

pleased?

_ Member: Oh, yes. The funny
thing was, though, I was playing
“Hypnotize” with my sister one

day using Nudas the pocket-watch
when his tail popped clean off at
the root.

D/R: Oh, my!

Member: Yeh, and so then we
just decided to split everything up

and call the tail, which may still be
wrapped in our basement freezer,
“Bud,” since that’s sort of what it
was, and the rest “Nancy” even
though he wasa boy (I guess you’d
say we were kind of a ‘liberated’
nuclear family).

DIR: That’s wonderful. You
know, it just goes to show how
things work outin the endif people
just examine the circumstances
with an open mind, determine what
is possible, and choose the best
option available.

’ And these early lessons can
instruct us well past childhood.

tural” movement is passed off as
an effort to instill a sense of pride
in students with diverse cultural
heritages (i.e. Blacks) by exposing
them to the historical achievement
of their own cultures. Why must
a history be invented? One must
consider the young children in
classrooms everywhere learning
“facts” about their ancestors, fill-
ing with pride and importance, only
to realize latter in life that their
knowledge islies. If thisnew group,
SERCH, is an organization that
“confronts the problems of diver-
sity”, I hope they see “‘multicultu-
ralism” as a hindrance to solving
any of their “problems”, not as a
politically correct panacea.

Philip Atchison is a junior
English major from Ruston, Lou-
isiana.

The Society would welcome such
a thoughtful sense of compromise
at Davidson any time.

For example, consider these
past few days. We hope you all had
a pleasant Homecoming expcri-
ence. Some people do. But often
the various tensions -- boy-girl
stuff, where to eat, where to party,
but especially boy-girl stuff -- can
make for a somewhat confusing
and stressful weekend.

Readers! you can make differ-
ence. The world is not a static
placg.

The Davidson. community
must simply consider both the
“XX” as well as the “XY” points of
view and evaluate what each party

‘is really interested in. Perhaps, in

the spirit of Nud, a satisfactory
compromise may be reached.

What will be discovered, in
the opinion Of the Society, is that
we need at Davidson a healthy
sense of ““Gromance.”

Etymologically speaking, this
word fuses the most beneficial as-
pects of the terms “Grope” and
Romance” into a pleasantry attain-
able even, perhaps, within the offi-
cial confines of a Davidson Date
Function.

What functional bliss! What
rational passion!

Someday maybe we’ll have to
just spit everything up and run off
with our own little tails, but why
give up without a fight?

So let’s work together on this
one. “Gr--” alittle, and“‘--omance”
till you drop.
