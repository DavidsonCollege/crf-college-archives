BENCH JOCKEY Dirty Thirty Faces ECC

ECHO CHAMBER REVISITED

It looked as if the boogey man had showed his un-|**

smiling face at the Charlotte Coliseum last Saturday night

when Dick Snyder and his St. Louis allies set out to

sharpen their techniques against a so-far hapless band
of journeyman hoopsters from Baltimore. .

What do you say about the crowd? Well, it was the
sort of turnout in which the opportunists among us picked
up a $1.50 ticket for a seat hidden from view by the cat-
walks and:then sat in any of several vacant $8 courtside
box seats. Better it had been played in the Garinger gym.
At least there could one perceive some semblance of a
crowd.

Those who have been in the Coliseum only to witness
Davidson basketball would have gasped at the sight of
sections upon sections of empty seats. Especially those
who arrived late to find the parking lot fairly full. Could
the girlie show at Ovens Auditorium next door have had
anything to do with that?

Coach Driesefl and his famous stomp would have
made like an earthquake, and half of the concessions
stands never opened. With the noise at somewhat less
than fever pitch, a good pinch was needed at times to
remedy the feeling of anxious enthusiasm one might get
from a two-hour practice session.

Don’t get me wrong. It was a good. well-played (con-
sidering the earliness in preseason play) and impressive
game. But it's not often when you can hear the bench
combining its ad lib talents at the expense of referee and
opposing player alike from where the double-lettered
rows begin.

Add to this situation the fact that the 24-second
clocks refused to work (maybe they didn’t play before
small crowds) and that Bob Quincy's slightly less than
eloquent “commentary” on the P.A. system did little but
confuse the performers on the court as he tried also to
play time-clock, and you get a pretty clear picture of the
uphill battle which professional basketball encountered
in Charlotte.

Oh, there were other minor disappointments. “Tricky
Dick,” the pride of Concord Road, '65-’66 style.did not
have an unusually good night, and other local favorites
Jack Marin of Duke and Bob Leonard of Wake Forest
never got much further than a pre-game introduction,
causing sporadic chants to enliven the facilities as well
as could be expected.

In between the glaring inconsistencies of the situa-
tion, there were numerous examles of beautiful execu-
tion combined with pre-season light-heartedness. St. Louis
player-coach Richie Guerin gave a lesson in the forgotten
arts of the outside set shot and fantastic team play, while
the Bullets featured the shooting of Kevin Loughery and
the antics of Gus “Honeycomb” Johnson.

Once again the people of Charlotte have shown them-
selves to relegate anything less than spectacular to the
role of second fiddle.

FROSH BATTLE FOR BOMB

As Cannon I! Explodes Over East Il, 12-0

‘Takes While To Feel Pro,
Says Former Cat Snyder

By YATES FAISON
Assistant Sports Editor

“It'll take probably until the middle of the year for me to feel within myself that:
I have started to arrive at being a pro basketball player,” said Davidson’s own Dick‘
Snyder after Saturdav’s game between the St. Louis Hawks and the Baltimore Bul-!

lets.

“The frst thing that. struck
me when I got to camp was the
willtingness of all the veterans
to help us rookies in any way
that they could,” Snyder said.
“Tha; meant a lot to me.”

“They worked with me on my
ball handling. which still isn't
near what it should be. and they
gave me con‘idence that I'll be
adie to do the job.”

Snyder dd not have as good a
night a3 he would have liked in
his first return to the Charlotte
Col'seum since last year’s con-
ference tournament. He did score
eight points and contr:buted a
good defensive game. but he
has set his sights a little higher
as the season nears its point of
no return—the onset of regular
season play.

Richie Guerin, the Hawk play
er-coach, felt that, ‘Snyder is
learning fast at a new position.
with a bright future at guard.
Right now he's not sure of him-
self, but that will be settled
with time. We're happy with
Dick, and I think he'll be around
in this league for a long time.”

Bullet Coach Mike Farmer,
himself a recently retired guard
in the NBA, also commented fa-
vorably on Snyder. “He shows a

In predicting the chances of

“This team is physically the

is a great challenge and rare
opportunity. We invited the test
and we feel that we are ready
