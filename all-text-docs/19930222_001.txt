New
Program to
Increase
Recycling in
Chambers

By Shaye Benton
Perhaps you have turned a
sharp corner and run smack into

one .. . Or maybe you have been __|

studying late for your first test of
the semester and seen one vaguely
outlined in the dark . . . Or at least
you have sauntered into class and
casually glanced at the new addi-
tions to the hallways of Chambers.
The large, blue bins located in each
hall are part of Chambers’ new
recycling policy.

With the current procedure for
recycling, Davidson faculty and
staff can now easily and efficiently
turn their trash into stash and cash.
Everything now has a place —
each type of trash has its own blue
bin in which to go after being used.
Chambers 223, formerly a storage
closet, now houses a collection of
blue bins for all recyclable prod-
ucts. All faculty and staffin Cham-
bers now separate their own trash
into the appropriate bins, the con-
tents of which are then exchanged
for revenue.

Dr. David Martin, Associate
Professor of Economics, has
workedalong with Ms. Ruth Pittard
to help this project succeed.
Months ago when many individu-
als noted Chambers’ need for such
action, the Davidson College Re-
cycling Committee and the Envi-

ronmental Action Coalition pre-—

pared a petition for Dr. Martin to
present to the faculty. “A lot of
people had been pushing for this to
happen because it was so reason-
able and the time had come for this
type of change,” commented Dr.
Martin.

The system improves the old
recycling procedure in which stu-
dents would visit each Chambers
office to pick up recyclable prod-
ucts and sort them on their own.
This old method faced difficulty

were granted on February 4, the
day after the Charlotte leg of the
national campaign began on Feb-
tuary 3 with an evening hosted by
Mr. and Mrs. John M. Belk of
Charlotte. A 1943 graduate of
Davidson, Belk is an honorary
chairman of the five-year campaign
to raise money for faculty posi-
tions, student scholarships, aca-
demic resources, capital improve-
ments, and annual operating ex-
penses at Davidson.

According to President
Kuykendall, “First Union’s won-
derful gift further highlights the
historic, ongoing relationship be-
tween First Union and Davidson
College.” Tony Bethea of the In-
stitutional Advancement Office of
the College added that First
Union’s “terribly important gift
marks the long and very strong ties
with First Union.”

Union Board Selecte

Call for New Building and Quality Programming

By Leigh Rawdon

The 1993-1994 Union Board
was selected last week. The offic-
ers chose fewer committee chairs
than in the past in an attempt to
establish a more unified and effec-
tive board. The chairs include stu-
dents from every class and from a
variety of social and extracurricu-
lar groups.

With adiverse board planning
Union activites, Merrill Earnest,
Union Board President, hopes “‘pro-
gramming will be inclusive to the
entire student body but with the
current social structure it is not,”
He regrets that more of the campus
is not involved in Union activities.

Earnest would like to see a

Union which brings the Davidson
community together in what one
faculty member called “a labora-
tory for Humanities.” But he be-
lieves the current inadequate fa-
cilities prevent growth in this di-
rection.

Currently the Union Board,
the SGA, and a Union planning
committee composed of faculty and
students are working to make the
new union the next project on the
campaign’s agenda. Eamest ex-
pressed the need for students to
work together to prove that there is
enthusiastic support for better fa-
cilities. He“encourages any stu-

Edward E. Crutchfield, Jr., chair-
man and chief executive officer of
First Union Corporation, is a 1963
graduate of the College.
Crutchfield stated in a recent
letter from the Office of College
Relations, “With this gift, we pay
‘tribute to the achievements of
Davidson students and teachers;
we recognize their strong promise
for the future, and we challenge
them to surpass our expectations.”

Trustee Beverly F. Dolan of
Charlotte and chairman of the Cam-
paign for Davidson explained in
the press release that because of
Crutchficld’s leadership on the
campaign corporate committee
“we’ve had an excellent response
form corporations and foundations
all across the country.”

College Planning to

Build New Facilities

Potential Conflict May Arise
Between Union and Life Sciences

By Tom Koonce
The Davidson College Facili-
ties Planning Committee is in the
process of reviewing proposals and

reparing designs for various new

Nem buildings 6n the college campus.

At the forefront of their study are
plans fora new College Union and
anew Life Sciences Building. The
committee is also looking at plans
for a new dormitory and a new
track.

Planning is going ahead for a
Life Sciences building which will
house the departments of Psychol-
ogy and Biology. This new build-
ing is discussed in the Campaign
for Davidson, but the college has
approached a national foundation
about funding this facility. The
college cannot conduct any more
fundraising for the building until it
hears from this foundation.

Kevin McCarthy, Director of
Corporation and Foundation Rela-
tions, said that talks are ongoing
with a national foundation to sup-
port the building. He said that this
approach is “not one that we’re
optimistic about.” According to
McCarthy this specific foundation
funds only two building grants a
year out of about 100 applications.

If the college is not successful
with this national foundation, a
decision will have to be made be-
tweena Life Sciences building ora
new Union. John Kelton, chair of

the Facilities Planning Commit-
tee, said that there is obviously a
“potential conflict.”

The college has recently

formed a committce to look at the
spaces and facilities to be housed
in a new College Union. Kelton
said that the formation of this com-
mittce is “one of the latter stcps
towards building a Union.” Among
other things, the committce will
decide what a new Union will look
like and will provide an architect
with the information they need to
draw up specific plans for a build-
ing.

Kelton said that he believes a
new College Union would be in a
“central location to student life,
academics and athletics.” He said
that a decision has to be made
between whether renovating
JohnstonGym (aproposal put forth
afew years ago) or building a new
facility would meet the needs of a
new Union best.

Kelton said that his commit-
tee is looking at a site that would
put the new Life Scicnces building
near Martin Chemical Laboratory
and Chambers in the southcast scc-
tion of campus. This is in an arca
at the south end of Richardson
Plaza, around the park arca that is
behind Martin and across the strect
