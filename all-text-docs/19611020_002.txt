Still Wandering In The Wilderness

The great discrepancy between
the interview with Dean Johnston in
this week’s DAVIDSONIAN and that
in the issue of Sept. 29 with the seven
students who studied abroad last year
is proof enough of the long-standing
ignorance and confusion at Davidson
about study abroad.

Hardly anyone knows we are af-
filiated in a Junior Year program with
Vanderbilt. Nor is Prof. Thompson‘s
position widely known or understood.
The student, we are told, must take
the initiative and responsibility for
foreign study upon himself.

We can appreciate how difficult
this responsibility is in the light of
the consensus of the opinion of junior
year students: “Davidson has hamper-
ed, students’ going abroad by lack of
information. authoritative advice, and
enthusiasm.” :

We must. conclude that apathy
and confusion at Davidson strongly
discourage foreign study.

Many of the nation’s leading and
progressive institutions have found so
much benefit in sending their students
abroad that they have set up special
programs for doing so. There would
doubtless be some of the same bene-
fits for a school located 20 miles from
the rest of the world and in the midst
of southern provincialism.

Davidson has long admitted the
advantage of having foreign students
here, but as yet remains blind to the
superior advantages of Davidson stud-
ents going abroad. Not only would
there be the academic advantages of
learning the language, culture and his-
tory of another people, but the ex-
perience of those who have studied
abroad shows that they gain in a
deepening and widening of their in-
terests and attitudes and a fresh look
at their studies.

Surely this is one answer to the
infamous Davidson apathy and provin-
cialism. As such, the college has a re-
sponsibility to itself to exploit the op-
portunity.

Even if the college does not en-
courage foreign study, it, as an edu-
cational institution, has a responsibil-
ity to offer at least a certain minimum
of academic advice to its students,
Naturally there wi ways be some
risks in yoreign study, but it is unfair
and unreasonable to ask a student to
risk academic suicide—and on the
basis of meager, misleading, inaccur-

ate, or false information, at that.
Davidson should at least put itself in
the position of giving some of the most
basic academic advice about foreign
study to its students.

Finally, the college has a respon-
sibility to its own academic interests.
Under the present system of) evalua-
tion of credits, and given the continu-
ed lack of knowledge about foreign
institutions at Davidson, a student
could conceivably spend two weeks at
a foreign university, pay $60 tuition,
and receive full credit for a year at
Davidson.

We are fully confident that this
has not been the case and we admire
greatly a very wise and understanding
liberalism on the part of the admin-

istration in transferring credit. As the:

number of students who study abroad
increases, however. the situation could
become disastrous.

We agree with the attitude of the
administration that the classroom ex-
perience abroad is neither the most
educational nor the most important,
but the college has a responsibility to
encourage good academic work and
protect its own standards.

We must, then, develop a better
system for the evaluation of academic
work. This is a specialized and com-
plex field which requires a rather
detailed knowledge about foreign
education. The responsibility should
be delegated to one informed individ-
ual who could advise the students and
faculty about academic problems.

We believe that the college
should go further, encouraging some
of its qualified students to spend a
semester or year at a foreign univer-
sity. Information about junior year
programs and independent study
should be made readily available.
Further affiliation with programs
such as that at Vanderbilt.would be a
logical step in the right direction.

Accurate and qualified advice
should be offered to the prospective
student to eliminate some of the un-
necessary risks and hindrances to
foreign study.

We hope Davidson College will
live up to its responsibilities and make
use of its opportunities in the rapidly
expanding area of study abroad. We
can and should make a reality of the
1-2-5 Club slogan “Davidson, an
international college.”

In The Palm Of His Hand

In assembly Wednesday, Bob
Stone officially ended a highly suc-
cessful, even phenomenal job as
Freshman Advisor and head of the
Freshman Court. Singlehandly, he
has led the Class of ’65 in a sincere,
dignified manner—and what is more,
has retained their respect and co-
operation.

We surely haven't seen the likes
of this in our three years here. Stone
has demonstrated the wisdom of the
Student Council’s action last year in
abolishing the Court of Control and
its humiliating tactics which failed to
do a thing for freshmen year after
year. It simply had nothing construc-
tive to offer.

The Class of ’65 still seriously

lacks unity—and we don’t necessarily
mean unity as displayed in a riot or

A Formal Proposal

The IFC restored an almost dead
tradition this Homecoming. The for-
mal dance on Friday night was the
first since Midwinters 1960.

From what we saw, the dance
was more than just successful. A good
crowd stayed even after midnight, be-
cause Sam Donahue’s Tommy Dorsey
Orchestra took an early break, then
played straight through 12. The fig-
ure, complete with tuxedos, formals,

hat burning. However, Stone tells us
“his boys” will have something to say
about true unity this weekend.

Upperclassmen proved conclu-
sively this fall that they are not really
concerned about a court, or its efforts
to “put freshmen in their place.” It
is merely insecurity and stale tradi-
tion which keeps it on. Only 15 fresh-
men have been turned in during the
six weeks—and some of these on
trumped-up charges.

We remain unconvinced of the
value of several of the regulations or
even of a need for them. Stone has
wisely held the spirit and true intent
of the court above its sometimes su-
perfluous laws, We congratulate
Bob Stone for his or.e-man accomplish-
ment. He restored dignity to a position

and bouquets of roses, looked worth-
while for the first time in a long time.

The music was good and dance-
able, and was a welcome contrast to
the rock-and-roll featured at fraternity
after-dance parties. We hope the IFC
was as pleased with the dances as
many of the students seemed to be.
We'd like to see the formal dance
restored as a regular tradition. It cer-
tainly proved its popularity last week.

REPLIES TO HEY
Kirby Sees Division
Of German States

BY LEE KIRBY

Concerning Juergen Hey's
article on this page last week, I
would like to point out that in
referring to a feeling between
Catholics
meant a feeling much like that
between Yankee and Rebel. It
is not only a religious antipathy
but a historical, cultural, and
sociological one as well.

Nor did I maintain that all
religious and party alignments
are the same. Even Hey must
admit, however, that in spite of
some exceptions politics in Ger-
many ‘do have a tendency to
follow these historical-religious
lines.

And in spite of the fact that
the majority of East Germans
do not suppert the current gov-
ernment, we will make a dan-
gerous mistake if we underesti-
mate the number and power of
the communists in East Ger-
many or if we ignore a natural
feeling on the part of many,
especially youths, that they are
East Germans,
Policies of the government.

GREATEST OBSTACLE
The greatest obstacle to Ger-
man unity remains the de facte
existence of two soverign Ger-
man states. The United States

has been put in the embarassing.

ironic position of refusine to
sign a treaty of peace with the
German people because it does
not acknowledge this dualism.

The creation of two German
states in 1955 brought about a
great change in the complexion
of the reunification problem.
The exact nature of these
changes was revealed at the
Geneva Conference in October
and November of 1955.

Austria had just been reunit-
ed as a neutral nation, but few
observers held such hopes for
Germany. Both Dulles and
Adenauer believed that Ger
many could not be satisfied as
a neutral nation. Germany
wanted to play a role in interna-
tional politics, and the United
States wanted a strong, rejuven-
ated West Germany on the side
of the West.

POLICY OF INTEREST

Neither the United States or
the USS.R. was willing to
negotiate. Their policy on the
problem of the newly created
German states and not their
bargaining is of interest to us.

Of obvious primary 4nterest
was the stalemate about the
military power and alignment, if
any, that a united Germany
would have.

The West proposed that Ger-
many be made a member of the
Atlantic Alliance. The proposal
was obviously completely unac-
ceptable to Russia.

WEST COULD NOT TOLERATE

Dulles, ignoring the possibil-
ity of a neutral Germany, ex-
plained that Germany must be

cal Soviet refusal and wreck the
conference.

Molotov maintained that the
remilitarization of Germany was
incompatable with the security
of Europe. The formation of
military pact systems has always
been the prelude to war in
Europe, he said.

The second main issue was
the method of reunifying two
States which were following
antithetical paths of social and
economic development.

WESTERN “SHOW-DOWN”

The Western Powers submit-
ted a so-called “show-down”
plan for free German elections
in one year. Although the Rus-

sians had been willing to accept.

free elections before the forma-
tion of two German states, they
maintained that the problem
‘was now more complicated.

The Russians emphasized that
Socialist reforms were se ad-
vanced in the German Democra-
tic Republic that a more com-
plex plan of reunion must be
devised. The economic, govern-
mental, and seciological prob-
lems were now too great to be
solved by mere elections.

Western observers scoffed.
Since that time. approximately
25% of the vouths reared under
East German socialism who fled
to the West have returned to the
East. West German officials, cite
an inability to adjust to western
society and economy as the chief
reason for the returns.

MOLOTOV PROPOSES

Molotov proposed that, since
free elections concerned all the
German people, representatives
of both German states be allow-
ed to sit in on the conference.

He pointed out that, although
Russia could not approve of the
“Junker” regime in western
Germany, they had opened
diplomatic relations in the in-
terest of peace.

The West firmly refused to
admit the representatives of the
German governments to a con-
ference about Germany.

Behind the deadlock lay the
difficult problem of the western
refusal to recognize the German
Democratic Republic.

REFUSE TO SACRIFICE

The Russians and the German
Communists refused to sacrifice
their new socialist experiment.
The CDU and the United States
refused to sacrifice the new
German wealth in the economic
and military union of Western
Europe.

On November 12, the German
Federal Republic ceremonially
inaugurated its new Army in
Bonn.

On November 16, the Geneva
conference on German Reunifi-
cation closed in failure.

I believe the failure was a
permanent one. f

Dear Editor:

Lhave a complaint against the
Freshman Council. It is not
representative of the class.

At their first meeting last
week, the Council discussed a
class project, which was pro-
posed by “Advisor” Bob Stone.
These 22 boys then decided on
the project and presented it to
the class.

The project was set before
us—to be supported or rejected.
We had no chance to even sug-
gest a different project! This
is democratic?

I feel that the various Coun-
cil members should meet with
their respective halls and take
suggestions for a class project.
Then these ideas would be con-
veyed back to the Council,

where the best ones would be
selected. The class. would then
vote on the best ideas, thus de-
ciding the class project.

. Please permit the class mem-
bers to say something about the
“class's” decisions!

osh Blasts Council:

Dear Editor:

T disagree with the point that:
the Freshman Council is not
representative group. From the
viewpoint of a tired old senior,
I think it is the finest collection
of freshmen that the council has
seen in four years.

As for the project, it is not
“the project,” but “a project.’
Others may be suggested at any
time. Evidently the majority of
freshmen thought it was a good
thing, for the Council went way
over its goal.

It. was purely voluntary, no
one was forced to contribute.
To Mr. Phillips, the Freshman
Council is young; however, they
already had growing pains. You
watch them and watch democra-
cy work!

A word onthe freshman class -
—after a period of over twenty -
years, I believe this class re.
alizes the reason behind: the
Freshman Court—not to make
them obey rules, but instead to
see the traditions behind David-
son College. :

I say watch the class of ‘65.
for I sincerely believe that they
are going to inject something
into this school that died along
with our first wildcat.

.LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Ferris Blames Students
For “Transfer System’’

Dear Editor:

As the routine of studies gets
under way at Davidson, the
familiar cries from dissatisfied
students return. (Unfair writs,
difficult reviews, etc.) Most of
these criticisms stem from the
Davidson “transfer system,” i.e.
the transfer of information from
professor to student and back
to the professor on reviews.

Since this “transfer” usually
takes place without any creative
thought on the part of the stud-
ent, any interest in the subject
soon becomes drudgery.

The result is a negative at-
titude toward education in gen-
eral and professors in particu-
lear. Education becomes a pain
which must be temporarily en-
dured.

Exactly where does the fault

lie in this system? The easiest
answer is to blame the profes-
sors. After all, they set up our
educational program.

I don’t think this is a con-
structive attitude toward the
situation. The real fault lies
with the students. The profes-
sors are using an inferior edu-
cational system because the
students allow them to do so.

Lack of student interest en-
ables a professor to present his
course in any manner he de-
sires, because he knows the
students will accept his material
without question.

If students took an active in-
terest in their courses and ques-
tioned some of the material
“transferred” to them, the pro-
fessors would be much more
likely to improve the system.

The only way to improve the
“transfer system” is through
student initiative.
