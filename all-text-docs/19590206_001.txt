Staples In Interview
Discusses YMCA Ills

“The trouble with the YMCA this year has been an administrative one, togeth-
er with the lack of student interest.” These were the words of Dr. George Staples,
College Chaplain and advisor of the YMCA Cabinet, in a DAVIDSONIAN interview

early this week.

He went on to say,
has not been as tightly an or-
ganized group this year as it
was last year. Its leaders, al-
though perhaps every bit as ca-
pable as last years’, do not have
the driving force that is re-
quired for an effective organi-
zation.” Dr. Staples added that
he has worked with the Y for
only three years, and he
likened the situation this year
to that of two years ago.

in comparing and contrast-
ing this year’s YMCA with
past ones, he said that co
operation with the freshman
advisor has been very good;
he also stated that the V
study groups are being hand-
led better. On the debit
side of the comparison, how-
ever, he admitted that the
membership and the gift
fund aspects of the Y have
fallen short of their usval
standards,

Officials Probe
Student's Death

Georgia law enforcement
officers continued investi-
gation this week into the
death of Tom Maxwell, 20-
year-old Davidson junior.
Maxwell’s body was found
Saturday morning beside a
railroad track near Duluth,
Georgia.

The Davidson student had
been employed at a branch of
Atlanta's First National Bank
since last February. He was re-
turning to the college by train
to resume his studies this
semester.

An inquest has been sched-
uled for February 8 in Law-
renceville, Georgia, to estab-
lish the circumstances of his
death. Police are meanwhile
holding Harry J. Hughes, 48, of
Birmingham, Alabama, in con-
nection with the incident.

“The Y. Dr.

A native of Quiucy, Florida, :

Maxwell belonged to the class
of 1960. Night school work
since he left Davidson kept
him up with his class.

Maxwell was a member of!

Beta Theta Pi social fraternity
and participated in several
campus activities.

Staples qualified this,
however, by saying that “the
failure is not due to lack of
organization or enthusiasm on
the part of the drive chairman.
This year he spent a lot of time
preparing for the two drives,
but for some reason, they just
didn’t seem to click.”

Asked one of the DAVID-
SON interviewers, “Does this
explicitly indicate a lack of stu-
dent interest?” The reply was,
“Quantitatively, yes. But I want
to mention that although the
membership is smaller this
year than in years past, the Y
has a ‘better per capita support
from its members.”

Pursuing the subject of stu-
dent apathy, the question of 3
possible cause was put to Dr.
Staples. He answered, “I can’t
honestly say that the YMCA
has tried as hard as it could
to overcome this handicap. Aft-

- er all, who actually: does try as

hard as he can? The problem is
basically this: Fields in which
the Y contributed to the stu-
dent body have vanished in
that these functions have been
taken over by other organiza-
tions.

“For instance, the Oriente-
tion program, which was ori-
ginally a Y project, has been
handled in recent years by
the college. The Union hes
replaced the Y's entertain-
ment function. | understand
that a good while ago the
intramurats program was run
by the YMCA and now the
Physical Education depart-
ment has it. The YMCA is
aware of this problem, and a
committee has been appoint-
ed to look into other pos-
sible fields of contribution.”

Dr. Staples was asked about
the connection and _ possible
conflicts of his dual job: that
of College Chaplain and YMCA
advisor. He replied that the two
jobs do conflict, and the ideal
solution would be to have. a
full time Chaplain and a full
time Y Secretary.

He went on, “For a man to be
an effective YMCA advisor, he
needs a good orientation in the
National Y. Personally, I dislike
the national and regional or-
ganization of tie Y. A good
administrative system is lack-

ing.

(Continued On Page Four)

Mr. Robert A. Currie, Busi-
ness Manager of the college,
said that. the two dollar in-
crease was necessary in order
to realize a net return of ap-
proximately 59¢ on the Col-
lege’s investment of $360,000.

Mr. Currie explained that
the cotlege has a nine million
dollar endowment fund which
it invests in various stocks
and bonds. Part of this en-
dowment has been invested
in the new fraternity court
instead of in stocks and
bonds.

The college must realize the
same net carnings from this
investment as it does from the
others. To reccive a net of al-
most 5%, the rent must bring
in 8% because the college will
have to provide for deprecia-
tion, insurance, maintenance,
and other expenses.

This same arrangement ap-
plied to the older houses. But
since the initial investment was
very low relative to the new
court, the rent on the older

Fraternity Housing Fee

houses was therefore much

lower.

The twenty-dollar fee, ori-
ginally suggested in the
spring of 1957, was set as
approximately the rent to bo
paid by each student per
semester. Since the fraternity
houses were not completed
until shortly before rush
week, the twenty dollar rent
was charged first semester
until a more eccurate figure
could be set.

Shortly before the second
semester began, the cost of the
Fraternity Court had not been
determined, but the twenty-two
dollar rent fee was printed on
registration cards.

The final figure for the cost
of the court will be known “in
a fow weeks,” Mr. Currie stated.
At that time plans can be made
for rent for the 1959 Fall
Semester, and according to Mr.
Currie, “there is a possibility
that the fee might be even
higher than twenty-two dol-
lars,”

Status Quo Prevails At

Athletic Council Meeting

A recent attempt by the
Wildcat Club to increase the
number of athletic scholarships
by fifteen was squelched in the
January meeting of the Ath-
letic Council. The Wildcat
Club's representative on the
Council read a motion, passed
by the Club, requesting ten
more football scholarships and
five more basketball scholar-
ships.

The Athletic Council dis-
cussed the motion for some
time before pointing out that
such 8 request was entirely
inconsistent with the athletic
scholarship program as_ it
stands now.

Prior to the meeting, the DA-
VIDSONIAN asked Dr. Tom
Sparrow of Charlotte, Chairman

Sports Controversy
Arouses Comment

The recent controversy
over increased athletic
scholarships brought dif-
ferent comments from
members of the admini-
stration.

Dean Frontis Jobnston had
this to say about the athletic
council meeting: “When the
Wildeat Club discovered the
system used, the whole thing
collapsed and we had a very
amiable meeting. There might
have been opposition against a
request to a direct raise.”

Dr. Johnston commended

of the Athletic Council, if he
knew 4d proposal of this sort was
on the agenda. He, along with
others of the Council, dis-
claimed all knowledge of such
a move.

A. statement was released
after the meeting that such a
proposal had been made, but
that its inconsistency had been
pointed out to the representa-
tives from the Wildcat Club,
and that “athletic scholarships
would, as before, increase pro-
portionately with the increase
of the Living Endowment
Fund." The DAVIDSONIAN
was denied entrance to the
meeting.

Before 1954, the Wildcast
Club raised all funds to be
used for athletic scholarships.
If the members of the Wild-
cat Club felt that there
should be more scholarships
offered, their problem was
simply to raise more money.
Four years ago, however, the

athletic scholarship fund was
combined with the general
Endowment Fund of the Alum-
ni Association, and the allot-
ment for athletic scholarships
was determined on a certain
percentage of the entire fund.
In that year; the scholarship
awards amounted to about
thirty-seven percent of the to-
tal fund, and since then, the
award has been consistent with
this percentage.

Last year the total amount
for athletic scholarships was
raised by some seventeen
thousand dollars, due to an in-

crease in the general fund of
the Alumni Association; there
are now thirty-four football
scholarships and ten basketball
scholarships.

The entire fund amounts to:
some $150.000 annually now, |
and is expected to rise to $200,-
000 by 1960.

According te a source pres-
ent at the meeting, the dis-
cussion of the Wildcat Club
proposal was led by College
President Grier Martin and
by Dean Frontis W. Johnston.

Dr.

Martin reminded the !

Councif that fast year the |

same proposal was made and
that at the time, all the
money granted to the Ath-
fetie Department for scholar-
ships had not been awarded.

His question was, “Even if |

the Athletic Department should.
get more money for scholar-
ships, could it find enough high,

school athletes

meeting the,

college entrance requirements,

that would accept the scholar-
ships?”

According to the same
source, Dr. Johnston remarked
that he was “not sure that the,
number of athletic scholarships.
is the answer to the degree of:
‘success’ of a college. I don’t
think that this is the way to|
make a better college.”

There are thirteen members
on the committee, including

three trustees, three members|:

of the Wildcat Club, faculty
members McGavock, Johnston,
McCutchen, and Scott, and two
students, Harold Westervelt,
and Craig Wall.
