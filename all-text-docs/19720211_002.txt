The Bavthaontare

LOUD AND

CLEAR

This is just one of the 500 buttons appropriated by the SGA
Senate from the February 1 meeting. The request came in the
form of a $30 loan from ad hoc committee member Mike Scott, in
order to keep the trustees informed that coeducation is still con-

sidered the foremost issue among Davidson students. Further, a
motion was carried to double the appropriation for the buttons,

which should be available by next week.

Bevan Confirms Trimester
As ‘New Academic Calendar

By TOM BRUCE
Contributing Editor

Vice President for Academic
Affairs John M. Bevan announc-
ed Monday afternoon that Da-
vidson would retain the 3-3-3
calendar for another year.

Bevan indicated at the regu-
lar meeting of the Educational
Policy Committee (EPC) that
he did not feel that the recent
faculty questionnaire on revision
of the present calendar consti-
tuted a mandate for change in
the calendar.

However, he indicated that an
effort would be made to con-
struct the 1972-73 calendar so
that the winter term would not
be split by the Christmas holi-

De a ee

days.

Two variations on calendars
that would keep the fall term
before Christmas, without frag-
menting the winter term, have
been suggested.

The first plan would begin
classes ten weeks before Thanks-
giving and would feature a five
week vacation, beginning
Thanksgiving week and going
through New Year's Day.

The second calendar would
project a split fall term with the
winter term beginning right af-
tre New Year’s. Both calendars
would end the school year by
the first week in June.

Bevan said, “I think it is very
important that we guard against
a shortening of the time that

Administrators Reveal Plans
For 1972 Summer Programs

THOM NICOLL

Asst. Managing Editor

Administraticn officials an-
nounced on Tuesday plans for
Davidson's 1972 summer session
and extended the policy of al
lowing regular students to par-
ticipate for full credit in the
Liberal Arts Program for Teach-
ers.

Director of Instructional De-
velopment J. H. Ostwalt pointed
to the special psychology course
with Broughton Hospital and to
increased extended studies op-
portunities as the major inno-
vations for this year’s program.

According to Ostwalt and Wil-
liam B. Hight, who directs the
teachers’ program, the first
term will run from June 12
through June 30 and the second
from July 10 through July 28.

Class sessions will last from
8:30 a.m. until noon, with a 40-
minute break at 9:50. Every
class will meet 170 minutes per
day for five days a week.

Regular courses offered first
term will include Chemistry 101,

students are on campus active-
ly gaining from the college ex-
perience.”

“A number of schools, _ be-
cause of economic considera-
tions, offer a five week Christ-
mas vacation plus four months
off in the summer. I don’t think
that this is a wise step,” he
added.

Professor of Mathematics R.
Bruce Jackson stated in the
EPC meeting that the summer
vacation should not be unduly
delayed, because Davidson stu-
dents might have difficulty in
securing summer jobs if the Da-
vidson summer recess begins
after that at other colleges.

English 103, English 250, Ger-
man 1, History 161, Math 25,
Physics 31, Political Science 140,
Psychology 101 and Religion 131.

Second term courses will in-
clude Chemistry 102, Economics
201, English 250, German 10,
History 162, Math 26, Physics
23. and Political Science 110.

Ostwalt stated that a course
in geography and Physics 32
are still being considered and
that other courses may be add-
ed. Professor assignments and
tuition will be announced later.

Both Os'walt and Hight said
that the participation of stu-
dents in last year’s Liberal Arts
program had been so successful
that there had never been any
question about continuing the
policy.

First term courses in the
teachers’ program that students
will be allowed to take are
Readers Theater under Profes-
sor of Drama Rupert Barber;
Creative Writing under Profes-
sor of English Charles Corn-
well, Black-white Relations un-
der Professor of Sociology Jo-
seph Drake, and Women in
American Fiction under Pro-
fessor of English James Purcell.

Students may take the follow-
ing special courses during the
second term: The Art of Poetry
under Professor of English An-
thony Abbott, Deviance in Drugs
and Sexual Behavior under
Drake, War and Conscience un-
der Professor of Religion Sam-
uel Maloney and Negro Voices
in American Literature under
Purcell.

These coures will be listed in
the summer catalog and may
be taken for full credit or for
extended Studies 1 and 2. Da-
vidson students will pay just as
they would for regular courses,
while teachers, whose tuition is
paid by the state and several
small foundations, will pay only
a registration fee.

Vice President for Academic
Affairs John M. Bevan stated
that he had questioned conduct-

ing the summer session for an.
other year, and that if this
year’s program were no more
successful than last year’s, he
would recommend that the pro.
gram be discontinued.

“If we are losing money and
if few students are benefiting
from the summer session, then
we are wasting our time and
money. Last year’s program was
not successful in terms of en.
rollment.”

Bevan said that he “failed tw
see strong support for the sum
mer sessicn,” and that the col-
lege may have to move toward
special institutes and independ.
ent study rather than regular
classes during the summer.

Ostwalt said he would like to
see students from outside the
South come to Davidson for a
summer for the experience of
living in this region.

Student body president Ralph
Peeples said that to get more
students into summer schools,
“we need more publicity. They
ought to do a better selling job.
I've never known of them real-
ly trying to get students to come
durng the summer.”

Both Bevan and Hight report-
ed that publicity is being  in-
creased and that information is
being released earlier than it
has been in the past.

Though Bevan _ expressed
doubts about the summer pro-
gram in general, Hight is en-
thusiastic about the future of
the Liberal Arts program.

“We set up this program six
years ago to help teachers in
their areas of need. The pro-
gram has been successful large-
ly because of the teaching abil-
ity of the faculty. Last year we
took a look and decided to keep
the teachers program _ going.
After all, Davidson is here in
the summer with its faculty
and facilities, and we feel we
should enlarge our scope to in-
clude the whole educational
community.”

... Students Favor Coeds

have on alumni giving.

One of the basic differences
between this questionnaire and
those of the past is that this one
plams for oceducation, Patterson
said. These plans were of three
basic types.

Plans of the first type call for
a sister school to be esiablished
or moved to the immediate vi-
cinity of Davidson. Over 55 per
cent of those who expressed an
opinion rejected these propos-
als, and of those who did sup-
port them, only 19 per cent did
so with enthusiasm.

Attracting the greatest support
was a plan which proposed the
admission of 300-500 coeds while
keeping the number of men at
the present level. Over 78 per
cent of students indicated they
would prefer this plan to any
other. This plan also has the
support of a majority of the fac-
ulty. The majority of those who
were opposed to it were those
who indicated they were against
or undecided about any form of
coeducation. A similar plan call-
ing for an addition of up to 400

women and a corresponding de-
crease in the number of: men
also received strong support.
Two proposals of a third type
which would provide for the ad-
mission of junior and senior co-
ed transfers or exchange stu-
dents were rejected in a major-

ity of questionnaires. Only a
slim six per cent would prefer
this type of plan to any other.

The alumni questionnaires
have not yet been tabulated, but
it is expected that the results
will be released sometime with-
in the next two weeks.

vide security (‘‘at least one
more man on duty per night”)
and to improve lighting in cer-
tain areas of the campus.

He also suggested that at
night students be provided as
escorts for the coeds, that stu-
dents walk over in the area be-
tween the main part of the cam.
pus and Grey House, and that
the Guest House be provided
with some chemical repellant,
such as aerosol cans of mace.

The Senate approved the reso-
lution unanimously.

College Registrar Richard C.
Burts, Jr. spoke to the Senate
about changes in the self-sched-
uled exam system. “These two
changes grow out of experience

and much time spent on’ the
part of the Registrar’s office,”
he said.

“In the past, we have let stu-
dents pick up their exams and
turn them in at any time dur-
ing a particular exam period,”
Burts explained.

‘“‘However, because of the con-
fusion which results when some
students are turning in their ex-
ams while others are still trying
to pick theirs up, we'll have to
require that students receive
and return exams only during
the times specified for each.”

“From now on, students will
not be able to alter their sched-
ules once they have been set,”
he said, but added, “‘Of course,
we can make éxceptions for ill-
nesses and other emergencies,”
