Scott, Committee

Pick For NCAA

By A. W. TURNER
Asst. Sports Editor

The first rounds ‘of \the
NCAA tournament begin to-
morrow, and just a quick
glance at the line-up shows
that once again it is “The
Tournament."’ Most of the
top teams in the nation will
be competing in the play-
offs for the coveted number
one crown.

The committee in charge
of aligning the teams in the
tournament is the NCAA
University Division Basket-
ball Tournament Committee,
headed by Davidson athletic
director Dr. Tom Scott.

Many of the teams are
given automatic bids by vir-
tue of winning their crown,
while ten more spots are
given to the ten best inde
pendent teams in the coun-
try.

The method by which
these independents are given
bidssis a result of season-
long study and careful
analysis of each team.

“At the beginning of each
season,” explained Scott,
‘the head of each of
the four regional commit
tees picks several coaches
from his region to watch the
colleges in his area through-
out their schedules. At the
end of the year, the coaches
and the regional committees
rank the top teams in their
area,

“The four regions are the
East, the Mid-East, the Mid-
West, and the Far West. The
objective of the cdémmittee
is to pick the top ten inde-
pendents to fill the ten
spaces in the regionals.

“For example, this year

Davidson Clinches Title,
Richmond Finals Victim

By DON PARMAN
Sports Editor

In nothing at all of a sur-
prise, the Davidson Wildcats
rolled to an easy title in the
Southern Conference basket-
ball tournament last week.

Most of the excitement of
the event was furnished by
the University of Richmond
as the Spiders notched two
upset wins before running
into the Wildcats in the
finals, and falling 81-61.

The Spiders came into the
tournament seeded seventh

trouble earlier in Johnston
Gym, 78-54.

In the finals Bryan
Adrian’s accurate outside

Spiders out of their zone

Doug Cook took over from
there. Jerry Kroll showed

his deft shooting touch with

Maloy, Cook and Kroll were

It has been rumored that
Charlotte does not want to
continue to host the South-
ern Conference tournament
because of the poor attend-

ances and the poor national

image of the conference.
‘

In light of the high mor-
tality. rate of regular sea-
son champions in the past
in the Southern Conference
tournament, the question of
whether or not to continue

the tournament at all has
frequently been raised, At
the present only the ACC

and the Southern Conference
determine their NCAA re
presentative by tournament.

Holland supported the idea
of a conference tournament
system on the grounds that
it sends the best possible
representative of the con
ference to the NCAA play

offs. “For example,’ Hol
land theorized, “if the top
players of a team were in
jured until Christmas, but
after the break’ were able
to play, they might be the
best team at the end of the
season but not get the NCAA
bid because of the early
losses. Then the conference
would not send their top
team to the playoffs

New Handball Club Emphasizes’
Improvement Of Campus Play

By HOWARD BOYD
Sports Writer

Behind—-the—leadership-of
Wiliam Brown, Charlie
Brown and Sterling Martin,
a_handball,.and squash club
has been’ organized among
Davidson” students, coaches
and faculty members. The
club-has—been—operatingfor
over a month, and accord-
ing to the organizers, has
been progressing very well.

The club, a fairly novel
creation, was organized with
several aims in mind. Most
important among these was
to increase the over - all
quality of play in the com-
munity, and particularly to
speed the development of
beginning players. It offers
a person the same chance to
compete with players of
about his own calibre.

This type of competition
also generates a great deal
of fellowship among the
participants, and provides a
means through which close
faculty - student association
can be developed.

Looking forward to |. the
future, the leaders of the
club hope to continue im

proving the organization, to
become a: more official arm
of the intramural athletic
association, and to bring in
top players from outside the
community. Ultimately, an
intercollegiate team may be
formed in these sports.

The club is divided
handball and squash
gories,
of ten players each in hand-
ball and two divisions in
squash, The ranked players
challenge those hanked high-
er, and unranked players
(those not in the ‘‘top ten’’)
can—challenge—players—rank-
ed seventh through tenth.
By defeating a higher rank-
ed opponent a player moves
‘up one rank, while the loser
falls to the lower ranked
player's slot.

Approximately seven-
ty players signed up initial-
ly, and more have joined, to
bring the total above eighty.
Very few freshmen are par-
ticipating, but about a
dozen players coming from
the faculty and coaching
staffs.

The club is open to all
who would like to  partici-
pate, and beginners are es-
pecially encouraged to sign

into

with three divisions-

“ly to operate for about three
