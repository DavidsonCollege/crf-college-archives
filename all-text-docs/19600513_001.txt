Council Reverses Position,

‘ DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C.

Gives Court New Power

By FRANK STAFFORD
Davidsonian Staff Writer

The: Student Council voted six to four Monday night to give the Court o
Control power to campus a freshman for one weekend, and to give the court the pow
er to decide how the freshman chapels should be conducted: This was a reversal
of the Council's previous descision to deny the Court this right.

This motion was passed after
lengthy discussion, - during
which Court of Controt Judge
Jim Bootle gave his reasons for
wanting these changes.

Bootle stated that he felt
that giving the Court of Con-
fro} power to. campus arfresh-
man was good, because it
would give the Court some
authority to back up its
threats. “I, don’t want to
operate on a bluff,” he said.

Bootle was emphatic in say-
ing that this power to campus
would be used “with a good
deat of discretion.” He said
that it would only be used in
cxses of extreme cockiness and
complete and open rebellion

Vandalism Slows
Dorm Construction

Vandalism is hindering pro-
gress on the New Dormitory.
Mrs. J. B. Moore, Supervisor of
the Dormitories, reported that
a number of windows have been
broken out. One of the workers
also observed some students
throwing rocxs at the windows
on their way to lunch.

“It seems to me,” comment-
ed Mrs. Moore, “that that sort
of behavior is beneath Davidson
students.” She went on to say
that the only previous case of
vandalism had been caused by
teenagérs from town.

Otherwise, everything is pro-
ceeding on schedule. Plans to
landscape the grounds around
the dormitory are being deve-
loped, although there is some
debate about whether or not to
tear down a little brick house
which was the original presi-
dent’s home,

At present, workers are paint-
ing inside the building, and
the lounge furniture is being
selected. Pictures for the
lounge were chosen from the
Fine Arts Festival display in
the Union ballroom.

against the rules set up by the
Court of Control.

This Court of Control, camp-
using, since it is backed un by
the Student Council, is an of-
ficial campusing: Therefore, if
a freshman broke this, he would
be subject to red book rules

of discipline governing break--

ing campus.

‘The second part of the mo-
tion was to allow the Court
of Control to conduct fresh-
man chapels as ‘it wished.
Bootle indicated that only the
freshmen who had already

been convicted of violations.
would be called up in front
of chapel. They would be
tried the night before the
F-iday chapel. Bootle felt
that doing away with calling
freshmen. up in chapel, as it
was previously planned, might
tend to cause tho upperciass-
men to lose interest in the
system for lack of contact
with it.

Bootle expresed the hope
that these chapels could be con-
ducted in a courtroom atmos-
phere, without jeering and
laughing at the offending fresh-
men. He said that the Court
would need the support and co-
operation of the upperclassmen
in this matter.
ultimate goal is to emphasize the
constructive aspect and not ‘let
the Court degenerate into en-
ertainment for upperclassmen.”
He said that the part outside of
chapel (i.c. the Thursday night

trials) would stress counselling, | of letting ¢
but chavels would be conducted Building.

He said, “Our, N I

visory Board. Dave Dillard,
who presented the petition, said
that it was signed by people
who believe that a “rat court
cannot be constructive by its
very definition.” He said, ‘This
amendment is representative of
a body of. opinion which holds;
that a rat court is not the best
way to introduce a freshman
to Davidson. °

The proposed , Advisory
Board would be composed of
20 upperclassmen appointed
by the freshman advisor.
These 20 men would aiso
serve as orientation group
leaders. As the amendment
reads, the primary purpose
of the board is to “give me-
ture counsel to any freshman
who requests it arid to take
the initiative in counselling
all freshmen on an informal
basis.” Another function of
the Board would be to ad-
minister freshman regulations.

This amendment was read by
Student Body President Henry
Shue in last. Tuesday’s chapel
and will be voted upon by the
student body on Friday, May 20.
If this amendment is passed by
the necessary 2/3 majority, the
Student Council’s decision will
be nullified and the Court of
Control will be replaced by an
Advisory Board set up by Fresh-
man Advisor Pete Wyrick.

Student Body Will Vote

On Summer Honor Court

.

On Tuesday, May 17, the Student Body will vote on a motion setting up a

Summer Honor Court.

This motion calls for a court
made up of nine members, two
of whom will be the Chairman
and the recorder. According to
the motion. the Summer Honor
Court and its officers are to be
appointed by the President of
the Student Body and the Chair-
man of the Honor Court one
week before the end of the
regular session. ‘

Student Body President Henry
Shue stated that it has been
the practice ‘for a number of
years for the President of the
Student Body to appoint the
summer school Student Council
at the end of the year. Now
that the Honor Court has taken
aver all student judicial func-

, tions from the Student .Coun-
cil, provisioris need to be made
in the Constitution to cover a
Summer Honor Court.

“We think that putting this
section in the Constitution
would safeguard the boys on
the court in cease of any ap
peels or accusations of sland-

er resutting from a_ trial,”
Shue added. The proposed
amendment gives the Summer
Honor Court jurisdiction and
responsibility for the investi-
gation and trial of all reports
of violations of the Honor
System or the Student Body
Regulations during each ses-
sion of Summer School.

The amendment makes pro-
visions for the Summer Hon-
or Court to follow the trial
procedure outlined in the con-
stitutional amendment con-
cerning the regular Honor
Court, and it gives any stu-
dent involved in a decision of
the Summer Honor Court the
right to appeal that decision
to the faculty.

“This amendment was pro-
posed at the request of some
boys who were on’ last year’s
Honor Court and Student Coun-
cil and felt a little shaky about
it,” Shue added. “Members will
be chosen from those members

of the Honor Court and Student
Council who will be at Summer
School here all summer. When
we run: out of these we'll pick
full-time Davidson students.
There will not be any outsiders
on the Summer Honor Coutt,
only students enrolled here dur-
ing the regular school year.”

“The reason for letting on-
ly the President of the Stu-
dent Body end the Honor
Court Judge choose the mem-
bers of the Summer Honor
Court is merely a question

We would have to wait un-

rtit the end of May to find out
who's going to be at summer
school anyway.

Rick Aderhold and Robert L.
Moore have been elected to the

positions recently vacated by
juniors. The Court is made up
of twelve students — six sen-
iors, four juniors, and two so-
phomores.

UNC CONSULTANT

As a consultant on the build-
ing, the architects have hired
Tom Rezzuto of the University
of North Carolina. Rezzuto is
on the staff of the Playmakers
Theater, and is assisting acoust-
ical engineers in planning and
equipping the stage and other
parts of the building.

Sailstad repeated the state-
ment that the fine arts center
would be finished by the fall of
1961. “

FC Contracts Four Freshmen
To Kick Off New Concert Series

_ Vocalists Will Appear

In November Program

By BOB MOORE
Davidsonian As sociate Editor

The Interfraternity Council voted at its Mohday night meeting to contract the

Four Freshmen for the first of the IFC Concert Series for next year.

The Four

Freshmen will appear at 8:00 p. m. in Chambers Auditorium on Saturday, Novem-
ber 19, following the Davidson-Furman football game.

The Four Freshmen were at
Davidson during the 1959 Mid-
Winters dance weekend where
they made two appearances at
the Saturday night dance.

PROVIDE ENTERTAINMENT
Their method of presentation
is unique, in that they provide
their own instrumental accom-
paniment.'  Collectively,. the
Freshmen play trombone, bass,
guitar, drums, and trumpet. .

In a DAVIDSONIAN inter-
view on Wednesday, IG presi
dent Jerry Cole said, “The pur-
pose of the Concert Series-is to
provide additional entertain:
ment that will appeal te the ma-
jority of the students.

“The Four Freshmen have
proved’ in the past to be very
popular at Davidson as well as
at other colleges in the sur-
rounding area.. The council
feels they will be an excellent
attraction to start off the
series.”

In addition to the Four Fresh-
men concert the Interfraternity
Council— tentatively plans to
have two concerts, or one lec-

“1 wouldn't want to guess how

many Davidson graduates can't
read their diplomas,” smiled Dr.
E. A. Beaty, professor of Latin
and Secretary of the Facuity.
“But a good many’ of them write
in and ask me for a translation.”

Dr. Beaty went on to point
out that Davidson is one of the
few colleges that has retained
‘the Latin diploma. In fact, it

been raised. The remainder
will come, according to Sail-
stad, from those wishing to hon-
or Dr. Cunningham, and others
interested in mecting a serious
need in Davidson's program.”

UNIQUE RELATION

Now that the plans are near-
ing completion, Sailstad has
made known some of the as
sumptions behind the plan’s pro-
visions. Said Sailstad: “The
new building will be uniquely
related to fine arts in a men's
liberal arts college.” The facil-
ities will give each student the
opportunity “to balance his
other studies with expcriencies
that will develop art apprecia-
tions.”

A study was made before
planning for the new building
began. The Arts et Davidson
reported that one of the col-
lege’s goals must be to “en-

The five divisions of the con-
test were feature, news, editor

“An interesting thing.” com-
mented Dr. Beaty, “is that some-
one will write in and say that
we got the wrong date on his
diploma.” Actually, the trou-
ble is that this liberally edu
ated gentleman can’t read
Latin.

Dr. Beaty observed that very
few institutions use Latin for
their diplomas or official cor-
respondence. However, he said
that Columbia Seminary, where
Dr. Beaty studied, sent its greet-
ings to President Martin's in-
auguration in Latin.

He laughed at the fact that
they sent him a translation “for
convenience.” He stated, “It
was very well done, but I think
there were a couple of places
where changes in the Latin
might be advantageous.”
