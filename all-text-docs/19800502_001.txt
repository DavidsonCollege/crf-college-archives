Cartmill’s
role defined

clearly at last

By MARK ELMORE
Staff Correspondent

Over a month since Athletic
Director Thomas Cartmill re-
signed, his new duties have
finally been outlined.

As tenured Physical Educa-
tion Professor, Cartmill will be
concerned with developmental
projects—something he wanted
to do when he became Athletic
Director in 1974. Physical Edu-
cation Director Sterling Martin
said that since Cartmill will
concentrate his efforts on devel-
opment, ‘‘a real improvement
can be brought to the recreation

Physical Education Committee ignored by all parties

By JOHN SIMAN
News Editor

Philosophy Professor Robert
Maydole is frustrated with the
Physical Education Advisory
Council.

“Stop pretending it exists
and abolish it, or have it start
doing its job,” Maydole said.
“PE is important in students’
lives....We ought to be working
on (problems in that depart-
ment).”’

The Council has met twice
this year. Both meetings were
called only after Maydole start-
ed “making noises.”

“The main function (of the
Council) is to advise on policy,”
Academic Vice President and
Council Chairman Price Zim-
mermann said. “If there’s no
policy matter coming up,
there’s no use wasting time (at
meetings.).”’

Maydole thinks the commit-
tee should have had a say in the
redefining of the duties of
Athletic Director Thomas Cart-

Trustees make decisions, not administer

By GLENN KELLUM
Assistant News Editor

The ownership, management,
and control of Davidson College
are vested in the Trustees of the
College. — Trustee by-laws

The Davidson Board of Trus-
tees will be on campus May 7
and 8 for their Spring meeting.
These 42 men and women form
one of the most influential
groups of the College.

The Trustees serve a ‘‘policy-
making role,”’ College President
Samuel Spencer said. Spencer
quoted Notre Dame’s President
Theodore Hesburgh as saying,
“The Trustees do not adminis-
ter the institution, but their
most important task is to see
that it is well administered.”

The Trustees don’t make day
to day decisions, Assistant to
the President John Cunning-

mill and Physical Education
Director Sterling Martin.
(Cartmill resigned as athletic
director in March and was

named physical education pro- ©

fessor.) The faculty by-laws
specify that the Council is
supposed to advise on person-
nel, Maydole said.

Zimmermann, however,
said he did not interpret the
by-laws to include individual
personnel matters. Further-
more, he said in this case
“there has.been no real change”’
—hence nothing for the com-
mittee to discuss.

Mr. Cartmill was already
professor of physical education
(as well as athletics director),”’
Zimmerman said. ‘‘Mr. Martin
has always reported to Mr.
Cartmill...and he will go on
doing so.”

Maydole wants the Council to
be involved in the planning of
the proposed sports complex.
Also, the Council should help
resolve issues such as the

ham said. However, in cases
where major decisions have to
be made, the Trustees have
‘ultimate power,’’ he added.
Spencer pointed out that the
power of Davidson’s Trustees is
comparable to that of trustees
at private institutions across
the country.

According to the Danforth
Commission on Church Colleges
and Universities, ‘‘the most
effective working boards are
composed of capable men and
women from a variety of back-
grounds: Ministers, lawyers,
doctors, businessmen, educa-
tors, farmers, bankers, and
many others.” At Davidson, 22
Trustees are elected from the
various presbyteries across
North Carolina; 2 are elected
from the two Florida presbyter-
ies; 10, who must be alumni, are

education program to intercol-

—_legiate athletics, Maydole said,

especially at a time when “‘we
are reshifting our priorities in
athletics.”

Zimmermann said the Coun-

cil has not examined proposals
for the sports complex because

there are none yet, ‘‘The (Coun-
cil) will be invited to join. . .in a
review of the facilities plan at
such time as we have one,” he
said.

The majority of Council
members want to remain tacit

Thefts mar Spring Frolics

By BOE YOUNG
Staff Writer
“A new rash” of larceny throughout town has plagued the
off-campus fraternities and’ ATO;~according to Davidson police

Chief R.H. Mills.

Both the FIJIs and the Sig Eps were victims of stereo thefts
during Spring Frolics weekend. Also, during Frolics, John

Turnburke and Jeff Coleman, roommates at ATO, had $95 stolen |

from them.

However, Public Safety Director Jackie Hughes said that he
knew nothing of the ATO incident and that thefts at on-campus
eating houses have been ‘‘awfully low this year.’

A thief entered the FIJI House Friday night, April 18, probably
through an open window, Mills said. The doors were locked at. the
time, according to FIJI President Paul Costel. Eight hundred
dollars worth of stereo equipment was stolen.

chosen by the Trustees, and 8,
who also must by alumni, are
elected by the alumni. ‘‘Each
Trustee brings his own talent,”

Cunningham said. The group is.

fairly congenial. “They won't
put someone on the committee
that won’t get along,’’ Cunning-
ham said.

Each Trustee serves a four
year term. Three consecutive
terms may be served; however,
one year must elapse after the
third term before a trustee is
eligible again. Some Trustees
have more time and are more
visible, Cunningham said.
Those Trustees living in North
Carolina have a better oppor-
tunity for involvement. Dean
Rusk, for example, is very busy
at the University of Georgia

Law School and has less time :

Three.of the six members of
Davidson’s Development De-
partment will not be returning
next year.

Vice President for Develop-
ment Duane Dittman announ-
ced his resignation early this
week. On July 1 he will assume
the post of Vice President for
University Advancement at the
College of William and Mary.

dent for Development and Col-
lege Relations at Queens Col-
lege at the end of May.

Matthew Covington, Secret-
ary of the Parents’ Council and
Board of Visitors, will enter
Columbia Theological Seminary
in the fall.

Dittman, who came to David-
son in 1977, is the third Vice
President for Development
since 1971. The other two,
David Cornell and Craven Wil-
liams, are now college presi-
dents, College President Sam-
uel Spencer said.

Spencer said the College will
“move as rapidly as possible”
to replace Dittman and Lee.
Dittman’s successor will be

’ chosen first so the new Vice

President can select a compat-
ible. Development Officer.

Covington’s position is being
discontinued.

As Vice President, ._ Dittman
coordinated the Development,
Alumni, and Communications
offices. His main responsibility
was the 1987 Program, David- ‘
son’s 11-year, $35 million fund-
raising effort. Spencer said that
because the 1987 Program is a
“long range effort’”’ Dittman’s
departure ‘will not have any
