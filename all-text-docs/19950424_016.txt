BACK PAGE INTERVIEW

i. between scenes,
members of English 452

discuss the joys and agonies of
Performing Shakespeare.

April 20, 1995

What is the purpose of the class?
Cynthia Lewis: The class has a
lot of purposes, in my mind. One
is almost purely academic, and
that’s to undertake a sustained study
of one play throughout a whole
semester through performance,
which in past years anyway has
proved to be a really effective way
to understand a play. And that
understanding provides a great
basis for understanding other
Shakespearean plays. I usually
begin the class by telling students
that it’s more than anything else a
sort of Outward Bound. ; It’s a
course in building community,
wherein students begin witha play
script and then are on their own to
put together an entire production
— finance it, advertise it, costume
it, design it, everything. That, it
seems to me, is an invaluable expe-
rience.

Why did you take Performing
Shakespeare?

Matt Smith: It sounded like an
incredibly intriguing class. I love
acting and all of that, and I wanted
to be in a play, but I’d never done
Shakespeare before. That’s quite
an adventure. The “Outward
Bound of the English department”
is kind of an enticing title.

Why did you take Performing
Shakespeare for the second time?
Eleanor Hatcher: Because I felt
the need to be a slave to Cynthia
Lewis. No, that’s not true — mak-
ing costumes can be fun.

Describe your previous theater
experience and how this differs
from it.

Catherine Rivenbark: I’ ve been
in plays since I was sixteen, and
acting classes. The way that this is
different is that I’ ve never been in
a Shakespeare play before, and this
is a completely different way of
acting.

Leigh Rawdon: I’ve had none.
Well, in the second grade I played
Patrick Henry, at a time when ev-
erybody in the class got a part.
That was my big theatrical experi-
ence. In tenth grade, actually, I
played an old lady in Arthur
Miller’s The Crucible, and | fainted
on stage. It was pretty big.

Do you feel the class is worth the
time investment?

Scott Lenhart: I think it’s worth
it for the group to get together,
form an ensemble company, and
put something together as a group,
holding hands across America.
Josh Buchanan: Oh, sure. I’m
also taking the 352 class, and I get
to see not only the aspects of the
plays and the texts and the whole

works of Shakespeare, I get to see
one play in particular from start to
finish — from the written work to
production.

What has been the biggest chal-
lenge?

Scott Lenhart: The language it-
self, learning the lines.. Oh, and
dealing with Dr. Lewis, Old Sin.
Amanda Bryan: Kate’s final
speech, which I still don’t have a
handle on so I can’t really tell you
how I’ve tackled.it. But, I think it
will be fine by the time the perfor-
mance comes around. And the kiss
is going to bea big problem for me.
I’m really scared. I don’t want to
be dripping saliva all over every-
body and gross the audience out.
So, hopefully that will work out
fine.
Josh Buchanan: Playing an old
man. Playing an old man is ex-

tremely difficult, especially when

you’re 20 years old. I’ve had to
watch a lot of old people on cam-
pus.

Laura Leibfreid: The most chal-
lenging part of the class was just
getting everybody to mesh — the

English people and the acting
people. That was hard.

Rachel Braden: Trying to learn
how to sew again, and trying to
keep a straight face on stage. It’s
very hard to do.

What has been the most rewarding
part of the class, and what have
you learned?

Geoff Graham: I’ve learned a lot
about myself as a person and my
ability to deal with other people
and adapt to the situation at hand.
The most rewarding part of the
class is, I think, several things.
Getting to know a lot of people I
didn’t know before ona more inti-
mate level. Seeing the things my
friends and I have built and put
together up on stage. Being able,
for the first time, to actually get up
on a stage and act like the natural
ham I am.

Mary McCrory: I just never real-
ized how much there was to think
about before, down to every little
tiny detail as far as even brushing
haif out of your face, It never
occured to me that you have to
think aboutevery move. The lines,
that’s not the hardest part at all.
Phil Lisi: I really like the fact that
I can crack bawdy jokes and do all
the nice, what they call in
Shakespeare, “dick jokes.”
Andrew Smitherman: Probably
being able to say that we’ ve mas-
tered a Shakespeare show. Well,

not mastered, but being able to say
that we’ve performed a
Shakespeare show. Getting to
know all these English people that
wouldn’t have done theater other-
wise if it weren’t for a credit. Be-
ing able to delve into the sexual
aspects of the play, boldly led by
Phil Lisi.

Leigh Rawdon: [ have to say that
sometimes it’s intimidating to be
in a performance with or to be on
stage with people who are so tal-
ented and who have had so much
experience. ‘But everybody has
been incredibly supporting and
encouraging, and ithelped me over-
come any fear I had of being on
stage. I guess my biggest fear was
not being on stage, but becoming a
character. I found that the first
couple of weeks I would just read
the lines and play a sort of nonde-
script servant, but then eventually
I worked with Phil on our particu-
lar scene, and I discovered who
Curtis really is, and I became Curtis.
I'd say that was definitely the hard
est part, but the most rewarding —

when I could actually act, or try, at
least.

found it rewarding to see how,a text fro1 3

issues about women and their place in Sor

What did you find to be the Becet
reward from the seminar part of
the class—the researchand study-
ing of the text?

Ashley Wright: I found it reward-
ing to see how a Shakespearean
text from so long ago relates so
well to modern issues, specifically
issues about women and their place
in society today, and the discus-
sions that we had about it.

Matt Smith: A greater insight, I
guess, into Shakespeare. When
you take Shakespeare as a ninth
grader in high school, they give
you a lot of stuff that you come to
find out here is kind of a miscon-
ception or not exactly true. So,
we’ve really looked closely into
the way things really were, or at
least the way we think they are,
and that’s always a good thing.

The sexixt slant of The Taming of
the Shrew is a major issue the class
has had to deal with. How well do
you feel the performance is han-
dling this issue?

Megan Mitchell: In the time pe-
riod in which this play takes place,
women were discriminated against
much more than they are now, and
I think that’ one of the things the
play brings out is the fact that Kate
is able to sort of manipulate the
patriarchal society that she lives in
and overcome it. And she finds a
way to live within and without the
system.

‘TAMING OF THE SHREW

__Rob Kosicki

In 1983, Professor of of English
Cynthia Lewis and a group of
students launched an English
seminar unlike any seminar be-
fore it.. Operating with the con-
viction that Shakespeare’s plays
are performance texts and not
merely works for literary study,

adapted so that an audience can
watch it and not be offended at all,
like a 1995 audience.

Sarah Zirkle: I think that the
class has come together from 17
different points of view, and has
discussed everything with a lot of
insight and maturity.

Rachel Braden: I think that we’ ve
done it about as well as we can
without taking out any passages,
which I think would be a very bad
thing. We’ve emphasized the hu-
mor rather than the political parts
of it. -

What similarities do you see be-
tween yourself and your charac-
ter?

Megan Mitchell (Tranio): Idon’t
know, I’ve never really had a de-
site to be a man.

Josh Buchanan. (Gremio):
Gremio and I are both nitpicky.
We’re both very nervous, and we
both consistently fail at our at-
tempts to find love for ourselves.

How do you feel about having to

Amanda Bryan: Personally, I’m
repulsed. But I’ll just put aside all
my personal discomfort, and real-
ize that this is art, and I’m doing
this for art’s sake.

So, sum it up.

Phil Lisi: It’s been a wonderful
experience. It’s totally different
than anything I’ve ever had. Dr.
Lewis has been great. Just being
able to work openly every day,
being able to offer suggestions and
opinions and see them become
concrete ideas in a play.
Everybody’s so talented in this
class, it’s just a pleasure to be a part
of it.

What happens to this class when
you run out of Shakespearean com-
edies?-

Cynthia Lewis: I’m hoping to
widen the scope of the course tc
include some of the dramas of
Shakespeare’s contemporaries,
which are highly neglected in our
culture and some of the most per-
formable plays ever written.
