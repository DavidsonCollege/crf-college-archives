Freshman 15: are those
pounds “fat or fiction?”

By LIZ DAVIDSON

We’ve all heard the horror
stories about freshman life at
college: the hellish all-
nighters, the roommate con-
flicts, the calls home for
money. However, the worst
nightmare Of all is the dreaded
“Freshman 15.”

This phenomenon has been
widely debated, but the truth
concerning it lies somewhere
between fat and fiction. The
weight gain is not a prophecy
for all, but it is a concern for
many.

-What have Davidson fresh-
men been saying about the
freshman 15? “I’ve gained five
pounds since I’ve been here,”
claimed one fe-
male. .“Fresh-
man 15? Its
more like the
freshman. 50!”
another
quipped.

Others, how-
ever, are. less
pessimistic..

probably " will
gain weight,
but not too
much. I plan to
exercise a lot
and eat good
foods. The one
thing that gets
me, though, is
the junk food.”

Other freshmen listed chips,
candy bars, and cookie dough
(2400 calories per package)
among the. most dangerous
junk foods.

For the freshman males, the
concern is different, but just as
predominant. “The girls eat,
and the boys drink...the beer
bellies in Belk are already
growing,” one student com-
mented.

Several sophomores talked
about their summer of starva-
tion to lose weight they gained
freshman year. Some are even
lifting weights in an effort to
gain muscle and lose fat.

“1 don’t know why I gained
20 pounds,” one sophomore.

commented. Obviously, last
year’s freshmen ate too much,
drank too much beer, and
didn’t exercise enough. What
causes freshmen to do this?

The answers came from
freshmen themselves. These
answers ranged from “I can’t
study when I don’t eat,” to
“the freshman 15 is predes-
tined. It’s just a time, biologi-
cally, when your body needs to
be nourished.” Another fresh-
man noted that “Mom is not
here to tell me not to eat junk
food.”

The most creative response
was, “The candy machine
looks sad when no one uses it.”

But then, that isn’t too often.

. The solution?
Freshman
Dair Brown
offered some
good sugges-
tions. “I think
thekey is to get
interested in
something, so
you don’t sit
around. It’s
also good to
eat meals in
the Commons,
rather than the

ion. Oh, and it
helps to exer-
cise,” she said,

runner’s gear,
as the rest of
the group sat
around—you

Rusk Scholar views Davidson
as “intriguing and intense”

By ADAM SMITH

I arrived nervous and ex-
tremely apprehensive at an
airport with a severe lack of
signs. I felt that I was little
more than another “run of the
mill” college boy with un-
latched suitcases and a stereo
whose speakers were collaps-
ing. Completely unaccus-
tomed to my surroundings, I
gritted my teeth and cooled
my heels.

Yet the next time that I
glanced at my watch, I became
a passenger of the friendliest of
Davidson sophomores, who
had kindly agreed to assist in
the transportation of the arriv-
ing internationals to their new
environment. It was Matt
Gantt, whoanswered thearray
of questions that'I put forth,
and not once in the short ride
did he make me feel out of
place--something which I
greatly feared. For that I am
very thankful.

It is true to say that the first
people that one meets at the
start of four months ina differ-

ent culture are very special.

Although some names still
elude me as I pass people |
know I’ve already met, most
names have stuck, and if not,
the amicable “all-American”
smile certainly has. “Superfi-
cial” and “shallow” were the
warnings given to me about
Americans-something that I
passed off on my first day. A
simple glance, a raising of the
eyebrows or even a “How’s it
going?” makes Davidson Col-
lege a place that cares.

With'a campus as beautiful
as the best the British could
offer,and the personal touch of
acommunity-oriented college,
Davidson is an almost ideal
place to enjoy.

While I might not have the
mysterious Mediterranean
touch which the French, and
most notably the smooth, so-

phisticated Spanish have, I
have become aware that many
here are genuinely interested
in having a “Brit” in the com-
munity.,I feel*that there is al-
ways a place to be--where is of
minor importance, just so long
as Icanmix witha wide variety
of you and enjoy four months
of life in a society which few of
us are fortunate enough to be
involved in.

I hope and know that the
remainder of my time at
Davidson will prove to be as
intriguing and intense, with an
open-minded president, a

mixture of internationals and

true home-bred Yanks. I am
already dreading my day of
departure. coe
For now, though, it’s back to
cooking bacon and eggs and
finding the best English ale, of
which I hope you will all par-
take when the International
Festival comes ‘round on Sep-
tember 16th, See you then!

( Presidential profile

BY HILARY COMAN

To be sure, everyone here
at Davidson has responsi-
bilities. Such responsibili-
ties often cause us much
heartache at 4 a.m. as we
study for that important
quiz or review. However,
there are some people here
who do just a little bit more
by giving up their time for
Davidson students. One
such person is William
Brewer, president of the
senior class.

Perhaps the mention of
the word “president” con-
jures up images of a person
who sits around all day and
sends memos. However,
when applied to Brewer,
this stereotype is far from
true. Because Brewer is
president of the senior class,
he is automatically a mem-
ber of the Senate Executive
Committee. This group con-
sists of the Senior Class
President and both the SGA
president and_vice-presi-
dent. Their focus comes
from the direction of the
Senate.

Brewer also works for the
Alumni Office and Alumni
Association. By working
with these two groups, he
feels he has gained some
insightin regard tohis job as
president.

“Here [at Davidson], you
tend to identify with a cam-
pus group--not particularly
your class,” he said. Brewer
feels that this poses a poten-
tial problem because the

dents simply as members of
their Davidson class.

To help alleviate the pos-
sibleawkwardness of a situ-
ation like this, Brewer
states, “I want toincrease
unity within the senior
class. Some suggestions we
have are a senior reception
at Homecoming, Senior
Night at basketball games
and possibly Senior Night
in the 900 Room. However,
we’re open to any and all
ideas for events for the sen-
ior class. There is always
more that can be done.”

Another responsibility
that comes along with the
office of presidency is the
choice of a senior class gift.
The process is fairly in-
volved. Brewer must
choose two gift chairmen to
aid him, and then the three
choose a 12 to 15 person
committee. The giftis a five-
year commitment, chosen
by class vote after the com-
mittee has sifted through all
possible ideas. As of now,
Brewer has no idea.of what
gift this year’s class is con-
sidering giving.

Overall, Brewer is kept
busy by his various respon-
sibilities as wellas the usual
Davidson load. However,
he sounds thoroughly satis-
fied.

“I really enjoy working
with members of my class
and with the faculty and
administration on_ issues
that affect the students. I
