GUY E. WEEKS OF DAVIDSON
STUDENT VOLUNTEER LEADER

Once more the honor has come to a
Davidson student to hold the office of
president of the North Carolina Volun-
teer Union. At the recent conference at
Greensboro, Guy E. Weeks, of the class
of '23, was elected to that important and
influential position. This is not only an
honor to Guy, but through him an honor
to the college also.

As president he will not-only head up
all the work éf*the volunteers in the
State but will also represent the Union
at the meting of the Volunteer Student
Council to be held in New York next
February. The ‘job has plenty of hard
work with it and there will be plenty to
keep the hands of President Weeks busy.

VISITING GIRLS TO SPEAK
AT “Y” SERVICE ON SUNDAY

The Y. M. C. A. at its regular meeting
Sunday night will be addressed by the
Volunteer girls on the Hill for Junior
speaking. During Junior week the Y. M.
C, A. program committee will be busy
finding out which of the visitors were
attendants at the Greensboro Volunteer
Convention a few weeks ago, and will
arrange a program of short speeches for
the vesper service. In addition to their
speeches, the young ladies will treat
those present to a number of vocal

selections. The “Y” workers of David-
son will furnish special instrvjmental
music.

It is planned that this “Y” service be
made one of the best of the year, in
keeping with the Junior week program.

“y” CONDUCTS CAMPAIGN AT
THE LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL

Although the Y. M. C. A. has sent out
men on deputations to other schools, the
local High School was visited for the
first time last week. The first period
of Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at
the High School was given to the “Y”’
men of the college.

On Thursday morning, Pat Crawford
and Doc LaFar spoke. Pat spoke on the
value of clean living, mentally, physically
and spiritually. He used for his example,
Jesus Christ. Christ was in every par-
ticular a perfect man. Although He is
pictured as being effeminate, Jesus Christ
was a man of tremendous power, phy-
sically, mentally and spiritually. Pat
brought out the bad effects of using to-
bacco and alcoholic drinks.

Doc Lafar then spoke on “Clean Ath-
letics.”. Doc brought out three points
to be observed in contests; namely,
fight clean, fight hard, and play to win.
The record of Centre College was used
as an illustration, where the above
paints brought success.

On Friday morning, Tink Taylor and
Dunbar Ogden were the speakers. Tink
spoke on “Friendship.” He pleaded
‘against snobbishness. He urged that

ness; namely, knowledge of. God, moral

On Saturday morning, Rey. Mr. Foster,

of the loc&l Methodist Church, and
Dwight Chalmers made the concluding
talks. Mr. Foster spoke on the Chris-
tian spirit of fight. Every worthy goal
must be reached after a hard-fought bat-
tle. The Christian ha€ the highest goal
to be reached. He must, therefore, con-
tinue to keep Christ as his guide and
leader, The only reasonable thing to
do, is to fight the Christian fight.
Dwight Chalmers spoke on the sub-
ject, “How to Live a Clean Life.’ The
two main clean living are,
self-control and service. Even as the

DR. GOHEEN TALKS TO
VOLUNTEERS ‘ON FRIENDSHIP

Dr. Goheen, a medical missionary to
Idia, addressed the Student Volunteers
last Sunday morning on the subject of

“Friendship.” A man cannot be of

service to the world unless he is willing |

to give up his life to his fellow men, the
speaker said, He showed that Christ
was a perfect example of a gentleman
and a friend. Dr. Goheen asked why
Christ gave up so much for His fellow-
men, and said the only answer was
That is the same answer
that the missionaries give, when asked
why they are so anxious to get back to
the foreign field.

Friendship cannot be obtained through
selfishness, which is the father of all
sin, but only through generosity, which
is the mother of all virtue.

Dr. Goheen told vivid
about the people of India.

“Friendship.”

Fritish Government has stepped in and

Put, sad to relate, many of them, while
yet in infancy, are dedicated, by their
parents to the temples and public shrines
where they are used as prostitutes.
Their entire life is spent there, and it is
almost impossible to escape, once dedi-
cated to these heathen gods.

Dr. Gooheen closed his talk by making
a plea for more of the strong, sturdy,
young Americans, such as those at
Davidson, to be willing to cast them-
selves in a foreign land in service to
their fellowmen. They may not become
famous and world-renowned, but their
works and deeds will ever live in the
kearts of those who would not have

MINISTERIAL STUDENTS ARE
TOLD OF NEED OF MISSIONS
* *

Last Sunday afternoon the Ministerial
Band was favored by a talk from Dr.
Robert H. H. Goheen. In a very inter-
esting manner Doctor Goheen told of
the many problems confronting the
missionary in India today.

Doctor Goheen showed how the medi-
cal missionary and evangelist worked
together in bringing the people to Christ:
Entrances: to villages were sometimes
won through” the hospital, after the
evangelist had failed. Although in some
instances the medical missionary can be
of a great service to the evangelist, he
is unable to take his place, Doctor Go-
heen said. Medical work, he said, must
be kept up as a demanstration of Chris-
tianity.

The evangelistic missionary must be
an all-around man, said Doctor Goheen.
Often he is confronted by civil problems
which, necessitate his being a farmer,
banker, merchant and what-not at
times. As an illustration he gave an ex-

a better solution of the Irish problem

than complete Irish independence. The
house ‘gave its decision in favor of the
affirmative.

D. R. LaFar delivered an oration on
“Are the Chances of Making a Living in
the World Growing Fewer.” He showed
the many opportunities open to all in
agriculture, forestry, and different in-
dustries, and the great work to be done
in developing the tropics. Walthall gave

ident of the Eu Society, was a visitor of
