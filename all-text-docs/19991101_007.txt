@ The Student Health Advisors _

They’re not just any t-shirts

By Jenny HapGoop
Student Health Advisor

If you’ ve wandered into the foyer of Cham-
bers this week, you might have noticed the begin-
nings of a month-long awareness program called
“The Clothesline Project.” The Women’s Issues
Committee, The Student Health Advisors, The
Rape Awareness Committee, and Health Educa-
tion have come together to honor victims of
sexual assault and domestic violence.

The Clothesline Project is a nationwide ef-
fort to commemorate women who have suffered
or died from domestic violence, hate-violence
against lesbians, rape, child abuse and/or incest.
Through a base in Charlotte, Davidson students
in the various Gender Resource Center commit-
tees bring the Clothesline Project to Davidson.
Now, we as a student body have the chance to
remember those people that we knew and loved

and to honor the many strangers who were also
victims of horrific violence.

As a visual protestation against further vio-
lence against women, men and women who choose
to commemorate a victim can do so by designing a
t-shirt that tells your story or the story of a loved
one. For the month of November, t-shirts will be
available in the foyer of Chambers along with art
supplies so that any interested student, faculty
member, or staff member may creatively and pri-
vately design and display a t-shirt that honors the
victim, but also reminds passers-by of the growing
violence in this world.

I promise you this display will be shocking,
and it will stick with you through all your classes
in Chambers. Since we at Davidson strive to create
a community that cooperates, learns from every-
one, and shares with all, then it is only appropriate
that we all share the pain of victims and their loved
ones. Show your support, see the t-shirts, and share
your strength.

The Millennium Musical
begins a new year of
Davidson’s Artists Series

By Setu Davis
Arts & Living Editor

Loud: Irreverent. Shocking. These three
adjectives, though not synonymous, all describe
the Reduced Shakespeare Company’s Complete
Millennium Musical. All those present in Love
Auditorium saw the millennium played out on
October 25, 1999,

Most, but not all, the audience seemed to
enjoy the Millenium, Musical. The Reduced
Shakespeare Company presented the last one
thousand years with a satirical outlook. Under
the auspices of trying to find the ultimate truth of
the millennium, the musical reviewed such events
as the Spanish Inquisition and the first walk on
the moon. From Leif Erikson to Mimi
Eisenhower, the Millenium Musical poked fun at
history.

The musical was funny. Much of that hu-
mor came from the musical’s iconoclastic atti-
tude. One of the central features of the musical
was its attempt to satirize prejudices, and in that
light, its attempt was commendable. For ex-
ample, one of the numbers was entitled,”’Let’s
Hear it for Homos Today.” This piece was
intended, I think, to criticize discrimination
against homosexuals by simultaneously poking
fun at homosexual stereotypes and by pointing
out historical accomplishments by homosexuals.

An anti-discriminatory message was intended, I
think, but whether or not this message was entirely
effective is another matter. I can certainly see how
the musical’s presentation could have been offen-
sive.

Satire is, in a sense, a matter of love or hate.
One either loves or hates a satirical work. In the
critical attitude taken by most satire, there is not
much room left for straddling the fence.

Unfortunately, one existing attitude that wasn’t
approached very often by the musical was the
notion of western history as being mankind’ his-
tory. The only mention of non-Western history
that I can remember from all two-odd hours of the
musical was a single sentence about Mesoamerican
civilization before the. voyage of Columbus. A
whole world of history was basically ignored.

Still, I found myself enjoying the musical. It
was very, very funny. Though I have some ideo-
logical criticisms of it, [can’t say fora moment that
the Millenium Musical wasn’t entertaining. It was
also particularly refreshing to see it here at David-
son. ; :
The Reduced Shakespeare Company is a
widely known troupe, and they kicked off this
year’s Artists Series with a solid boot, The next
Artists Series event is the coming of the North
Carolina Dance Theatre. I highly encourage you to
get out and see this wonderful group of talented
dancers.

Cabaret an opening night success
Fall musical continues through this weekend

By Setu Davis
Arts & Living Editor

On Thursday, October 28, the Davidson The-
atre Department's production of the hit Broadway
musical Cabaret opened with an energetic and
successful performance.’ For those of you who
didn’t get the chance to see “Cabaret” this week-
end, or for those of you who want to see it again,
I strongly recommend getting a ticket and going to
Hodson Hall to see this wonderful performance.

“Cabaret” is set in Germany in 1929-1930,
before the Nazi party took complete control of the
German people.’ Tensions were already rising
during this time period, and “Cabaret” dramatizes
these tensions as part of the storyline. The musical
explores ‘notions of happiness, sexuality, preju-
dice, all with a sense of the picaresque.

A full review of “Cabaret” will appear in
next week’s Arts & Living section. The perfor-
mance times for this week are listed in the “On the *
Scene” portion of the Arts & Living section.
