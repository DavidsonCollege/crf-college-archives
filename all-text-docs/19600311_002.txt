THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

Make The Claims Good |

Probably the most important social
decision a Davidson student makes is
whether he should join a fraternity,
and if so, which one to join. On the
other hand, a fraternity exists from
year to year on the basis of the class
it pledges. It is tragic to force each
party to make its choice on the basis
of one week’s contact.

Any rush system which would put
off this decision for a length of time
should be welcomed by fraternities
and freshmen alike. A  mid-first
semester system, a second semester

_system and a second-year system all

offer advantages, and it is ours to
compare and pick the best of the
three, and then to compare the result
with the present system.

One of the main objections to any
sort of delayed rushing is that Rush
Week would turn into a longer period,
even more nervewracking and upset-
ting than the week used now. This
may be true.

The‘ key, however, to the solution
is to postpone the rush period long
enough to make this result imprac-
tical; the delay should be long enough
so that any concentrated rushing
would be a pbvsical and mental im-
possibility.

Mid-semester rush? Take for in-
stance November. Every upperclass-
man knows how rapidly the time
from. September to Thanksgiving pas-
ses. Knowing that in this short time
every day is precious for his frater-
nity, the fraternity member will be
driven by the rush fever for two and
a half months.

Same for second semester rush.
February is still not out of range for

high pressure methods. The result
would be the same.

But a year-long wait is another
matter. To a student just finished
with his freshman year, his place in
the junior class seems as far away
as his graduation. We think that a
year — 12 months — is just too long
for heavy individual rushing. We
are inclined to -think that organ-
ized hot-boxes for a year would be
non-existent. The underlying feeling
and responsibility would still be
there, though, and friends between
classes would be made.

A year is time enough to get beyond
the erroneous first-impression stage,
and both the fraternity man and the
freshman‘ would be able to make a
more accurate evaluation of one
another.

There is a difference, however, in
organized individual rushing and or-
ganized group impression. Frater-
nities would have to be on their toes,
and we think that nothing would do
a complacent system more good.
Freshmen will be looking for group
participation — intramural sports,
fraternity sing, constructive projects.
These are the things that help to
build the nebulous brotherhood
which each fraternity advertises. A
fraternity who advertises and fails
to produce will regret it when Rush
Week, distant as it will seem at the
time, appears on the campus.

We do not deny that there are dis-
advantages. But we feel that they are
questions: of practicality. Systems
having a solid theoretical basis can
overcome practical problems if these
are worked on. But it is a rare occa-
sion when a basically faulty system
succeeds, regardless of practicality.

Have A Reason For Your Vote

Ho-hum, its election time again.

It’s really rather dull after four
years of the same thing. The glad
hands go out, the white teeth flash
as the campus politicos begin the big
push.

The same old campaign issues are
revived.

“If I am elected I will see to it that
we have better student faculty re-
lationships.”

Or, “If I am elected, I will endeavor
to have substantial changes made in
the curriculum.”

Now these things are good, but
candidates have been saying them for
many years and after you have heard
them a few times they lose any vital
meaning.

There was one candidate of a past
_ generation that had a different ap-
proach.

“If I am elected,” he said, “I will
see to it that such and such a dormi-
tory is torn down by next year.” He
won and it went, but the connection
between the circumstances is doubt-
ful.

This just points up the fact that
issues really don’t mean anything on
this campus. Personality and frater-
nity affiliation, or the lack of it, are
far more relevant factors.

Maybe we're idealistic, but we wish
issues played a more important part
in the way elections are decided. Re-
cent campus discussions show that
there are controversial matters on
which definite stands could be taken.

Pete Kellogg, chairman of the elec-
tions board, stated in chapel Tuesday
that candidates will have more op-
portunity to express themselves on
basic problems during the coming
election period. Despite the lack of
interest in such a program that the
students exhibited by their reaction
to his-proposals, we feel that there is
much merit in such a plan.

In the past there have been times
when failure to get beyond surface
appearances, and the lack of con-
sideration of ability and candidates’
views, have put the wrong men into
office.

Let's not let it happen again.

Metamorphosis Of Hell Week:
Change Has Taken Thirty Years

By ERVIN OUGGAN
Davidsonian Managing Editor

Hell Week — 1s it immortal?

The answer comes next week.
Ward McKeithen anad the Inter-
fraternity Council will attempt
to steer fraternities through
“Greek” Week, a_ cleaned-up,
closely-regulated pre-initiation
period.

OLD TRADITION

But a glance at the record
proves fraternity Hell Week
hazing to be one of Davidson's
most durable traditions, appar-
ently undaunted after thirty
years of pummeling from facul-
ty, student leaders and campus
publications. ‘
- “There has always been fac-
ulty complaint about Hell
Week,” said Dean Frontis John-
ston yesterday. “This has been
going on ever since I can re-
member, and that’s a pretty
long time.”

30 YEARS OF HELL
.And research in publications
files shows a history of at
least thirty years complaint
against pre-initiation hazing.

In the early thirties, DAVID-
SONIAN reporters included
only cryptic mention of Hell
Week hazing. Humor columns
mention “pledge = suffering.”
and news writers distinguished
sharply between “regular” init-
jation and: “formal” initiation,
a model initiation was held for
the benefit of the faculty.”

“REGRESSIVE”

The first anti-Hell Weer edi.
torial in the DAVIDSON'AN
appears in February, 1936. The
editor then called Hell Week
“not just foolish but actually
regressive.”

“It would be .. . a step for-
ward for fraternities at David-
son to cast onto the junk heap
this worn-out custom,” he said.

But Hell Week escaped the
junk heap, and another editor
in 1938 penned a hew appeal
‘entitled “Away With Hell
Week!”

After the thirties DAVID-
SONIAN anti-Hell campaigns
became traditional, with each
year’s editor presenting the
case against Hell Week—usual-
ly after Hell Week.

Faculty resolutions condemn-
ing Hell Week activities appear-
ed almost yearly, braced with
statements of faculty confi-
dence in “student maturity and
judgment.” .

GREEK WEEK ADVENT

“Student maturity and judg-
ment” apparently dictated no
action until 1951, when the In-
terfraternity Council declared
the death of Hell Week and the
advent of “Greek” Week. No
reports of “Greek Week suc-
cess ate to be found in the
DAVIDSONIAN, though in 1954
a preGreek Week article ap-
peals to fraternities for “full
co-operation.”

1956: “HELP WEEK”

Greek Week, 1956. made top
headlines. “Practically all the
fvaternities . . . call it ‘Help
Week.” the DAVIDSONIAN
reporter writes. He lists some
“Help” Week features: brick
sacts. catrying eggs in pockets,
walking backwards to all classes
and meals, and “eating from
troughs with no utensils.”

The 1956 article ends on a
happy note: “Help Week -leaves
many unusual memories, snap-
shots and accomplished pro-

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR:

Recent Letters And Articles Draw Student Reaction

Dave Mullen

Dear Editor:

I can not remain silent after
reading Mr. Atchison’s letter.
His letter demands an answer
not only because of what he
said, but more important be-
cause it characterizes the prev-
alent attitude on the Davidson
campus,

1 first want to take issue
with Atchison’s method of
reasoning. it is one thing to
attack a man’s opinions and
reasoning, and quite another
to attack him personally.

In logic, this is called ad-
hominem, an evasive technique
whereby one attacks one’s op-
ponent rather than dealing with
the subject under discussion.
Ad hominem is commonly re-
ferred to as character assassina-
tion.

During recent weeks at
Davidson much campus afti-
tude has reflected this atti-
tude in such matters as trus-
tee policies, curriculum
problems, fraternity — “in-

lationships. Rabblerousing,
banner-flying has been the
order of the day.

Many of us have not sought
or attempted to understand
how to speak the truth in love.
Even more tragie, many of us
don’t care.

Atchison’s sharp invective
against one “rare and frust-
rated professor,” | take issue
with on two counts.

First, whether or not one can
agree in toto with the policies
advocated by this professor, one
should be grateful that David-
son has rare professors whose
love for Davidson and vision of
what Davidson can become is
sufficient warrant for him to
“get out on a limb,” be at odds
with those wanting to keep the
status quo at Davidson. Too
many of us fall in the latter
category.

Secondly, apparently Atchi-
son is not a very good student
of history. Many of the great
men of history have. been

ABOLITION

Bob Jones’ 1958 IFC made no
effort to call Hell Week
“Greek” or “Help” week. The
result: a no-holds-barred Hell
Week which resulted in a
strong IFC statement “abolish-
ing” Hell Week. Offending fra-
ternities were fined and pro-
ceeds earmarked for a proposed
1959 “Greek Week,” calling for
constructive projects and close
supervision.

Greek Week 1959 drew criti-
cism from faculty and the DAV-
IDSONIAN again. An editorial
appeared—after Greek Week—
urging students to “Put the
Greek Back in Hell Week.”

LOOPHOLES?

The IFC replied in a letter
that Jones’ IFC had drawn up
“yague”’ Greek Week regula-
tions which were “full of loop-
holes.”

To complaints about long in-
firmary casualty lists, the IFC
spokesman answered: “As for
the long infirmary lists, they
will probably always be with
us..."

FACULTY DUBIOUS

Will the 1960 effort be the
Greek Week long hoped-for by
faculty and IFC, rather than
another thinly-disguised Hell
Week?

Faculty skeptics, hardened by
over thirty years of Hell Week,
say probably not.

One facuity member summed
it uo: “I've seen this thing per-
sist for years without much
change, and now I'm a pessi-
mist. I frankly think faculty
action is the only hope. I hope
I’m wrong.”

men willing to stand out:
atone from the conventional,
comfortable status quo and
to voice and hold firm to
their convictions. Take Soc-
rates, Christ, Lincoln for ex-
amples,

Finally, Atchison’s statement:
“All in all it seems rather
ridiculous to me” (referring to
the activities of this frustrated
professor and his frustrated
disciples) points out rather
well, I think, the basic malady
of Davidson today — our com-
placency with the status quo at
Davidson and our easy willing-
ness to harangue or belittle
anyone advocating change.

in his own country.”

STERLING COMMENTS:
a

Unions Are Losing
Power, Position Pp =

By PETER STERLING im ai’

After the 1958 Congressional Election, COPE
(CIO-AFL Committee on Political Education) stated that
the thirteen-million member Union was directly respon-
sible for the election of 201 congressmen (over 90 per-
cent Democrats).

Union leaders predicted a new era for labor
superiority and the riew “Labor Congress” acclaimed
a progressive “Mandate” from the American people
for labor-backed legislation.

In a somewhat dynamic society, forces are constant-
ly interacting to form a pendulum-type movement or
contervailing tendencies. (Such is particularly evident in
Washington despite bureaucracy and seniority.)

The pendulum has swung a great distance from
November, 1958, to March, 1960, in a reaction
against unions.

What are some of the reasons for this rapid deter-
ioration of union fortune?

Primarily they are economic, complemented by
a very effective propaganda campaign by President
Eisenhower. The fear of inflation, rising prices, the
reduction of the value of the dollar, the unbalanced
budget in periods of prosperity — all have been at-
tributed in the union’s ability to demand and re-
ceive constant wage increases, often in excess of
productivity.

Second, there is a genuine fear — well grounded —
that U. S. industries are “pricing themselves out of the
market.” “Made in Germany” or “Made in Japan” are
common on goods formerly produced by U. S. industry
The rapid recovery of Europe and Japan. has created
a competition with U. S. goods unknown even eighteen
months ago.

Imports exceeded exports in 1958 for the first
time in twenty-five years. This, coupled with vast
military expenditures in foreign countries, a flow
of capital investments abroad, and loans, has made
the U. S. position in the balance of payments ex-
tremely unfavorable and dangerous.

A catalyst for the reaction against unions in the
last years was provided by James Hoffa. His insolence
before Congress, his powermania, and his disregard for
his own union members has created a ogre-image in the
public eye.

The Griffin-Landrum Act was directed more at
the Hoffas than the CIO-AFL, but it created a derog-
atory impression of all unions.

The recent steel strike, the impending railroad
strike, and the lesser strikes are, and will be, more bit-
terly contested by management. Whether management
is correct or not in its demands, the American public
has received the impression that unions have caused
inflation.

In the present national mood this is an un-
fortunate lebel. Against an adamant, well-regiment-
ed union management would be hard pressed to suc-
ceed, but actually the cohesiveness of union mem-
bers is not monolithic.

Not only in the political realm are there “heretics,”
but the present prosperity of most members makes the
union itself less meaningful to them. Often they are
complacent, even resentful, towards the leaders.

The union movement has simply been so suc-
cessful in this country that members have gained
just about as much as they want from unions, and
now would rather “sit back and enjoy it.”

The “Mandate of 1958” is dead. Two questions arise:
Can union leaders wield enough power to solidify its
members to present a united front in the current strikes,
and can COPE elect over 200 more “Laborites” to the
87th Congress?

It seems as if Gargantua has been emasculated by
cancer and attrition.

administration, the holy Board
of Trustees, the I. F. C., by new
systems and_ institutions, by
proclaiming to the Yankees and
the Pope that we love every-

This let-George-and-the-sys -

troubles me. What happens in

with organizations doing this,
“frustrated” professors doing
that, and the Board of Trustees
still not doing that other thing
has made me a real fan.

1 was sorry, though, to read
Glyn Hughes’ comments last
Friday night — sorry, embar-
rassed, disappointed that an

Englishman has to remind us
that, even in this sophisticated
age, it is the individual that
makes a society.

Americans once reminded the
rest of the world of that bit of
human engineering. Now we
are the spineless and breezy-
minded creatures that go to
ecumenical conferences with
the apology: “My miserablé
superstition is Christianity,
what's yours?"

We've gotten the idea that
Davidson can be something
more or different than each
one of us in its student body.

We have decided to make
ourselves Christians and David-
son the finest school in the
South and our fraternities real
fraternities by decree of the

several years when we take the
responsibility for our country?

We will indeed have a so-
ciety; but we should prepare
ourselves for the disillusioning
results:

The class of 73 (and 72, and
‘71, and 70) will be taking
ROTC honors to keep some
George, either the Supreme
Court, the U. N., or Nikita, who
will have taken us up on the

offer, from doing everything

for us.

God gave us power as in-
dividuals. (idealistic? But what
could be more idealistic than
the Davidson we are trying to
make?) We can use it to make
something of ourselves (pursue
philosophy instead of complain.
ing about there being only one
professor, help set the stand-
ards of a fraternity or society
instead of abandoning ell as
lost . . :) or we will have richly
earned our place in the ranks
of schools and nations that
have gone down (the middle of)
the road of mediocrity and
otilivion to the tune of Mic
K-oey- M-0-use.
