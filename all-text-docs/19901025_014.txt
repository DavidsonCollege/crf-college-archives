NCAA Changes Afoot

By KRISTI KESSLER

and
LISA LENARD

On behalf of the Advisory
Council on Intercollegiate Athlet-
ics, we would like to inform the
college community of two impor-
tant issucs.

The first regards the uscr pol-
icy of Davidson College Athletic
Facilities. Details are currently
being worked out to provide amore
liberal guest policy in response to
concerns of students and faculty.

Currently, outdoor facilitics,
including tennis courts, the golf
course, the lake campus and the
track, hold an open guest policy, as
long as the guest is accompanicd
by a Davidson student, faculty or
staff member. However, students,
faculty and staff, would have prece-
dence over any guests if the out-
door facilities were to become
overcrowded.

A policy that grants a limited
number of free “guest passes” for
use of Baker Sports Complex by
friends and family members of
students, faculty and staff will be
implemented in the near future.

The council would also like to

inform students who participate in
the Big Brother - Big Sister Pro-
gram that théy may obtain free
basketball tickets for most games
for their Little Brother/ Sister from
the ticket office. More details will
be provided later.

The second issue regards the
possible restructuring of divisions
within the NCAA. Currently,
Division I is subdivided into three
subdivisions according to the foot-
ball program of the member school.
Division I-A includes all schools
witha Division I football program.
This includes teams like Michigan
and UCLA. Division I-AA includes
all schools that play Division I-AA
football. This includes schools like
Furman and the Citadel. Division
I-AAA includes schools’ with
Division III football, or no foot-
ball, but Division I in other sports.
This includes Davidson, and
schools such as Georgetown and
St. John’s.

There isatwenty year old battle
between the subdivisions which
may come toa head this January at
the annual NCAA convention.
Schools in Division I-A with “Big
Time” athlctic programs want to

make their own decisions regard
ing issues such as limits on schol
arship distribution.

The three legislative propos
als which could have the greates
impact on Davidson’s_ athleti
program, if passed, include:

1) a proposal that would preven
us from moving to Division III »
football, without providing a vi
able option, such as creating
Division I-AAA football prograrr
2) a proposal that would establis!
minimum financial aid require
ments in terms of athletic grant
for membership.

3) a proposal that would requir
that only Division I contests b
used to fulfill minimum schedul
ing requirements in all Division
sports and that 50% of those con
tests above the minimum level als:
be against Division I teams.

If anyone has any concern
about these, or any other athicti
issues at Davidson, please feel fre
to contact any student or facult
member of the Advisory Counci
(Kristi Kessler, Stephen Bell, Lis
LeNard, Peter Krentz, Salk
McMillen, J.B. Stroud and Ton -
Kazce).

Davidson Team Shines

This past weekend, the men
ran a partial squad in a“‘warm-up”
5K race. With the Davidson’s fron-
trunners resting up for the Confer-
ence Meet, the younger runners
showed excellent form for this
stage in the season. The team thanks
all those of who who attended our
home race last Saturday. This
coming week, Coach Andrew will

choose the seven runners who will .
represent Davidson at the Confer-

ence Meet.

The strong contribution from
each runner has pleased Coach
Andrew, who likes the team’s
chances to topple Radford in the
Big South Championship. The
men’s willingness to work hard
and compete like champions has
shone, and the Conference has
taken notice of thisnew challenger.
Not enough can be said about the
runners’ improvement over last
year, and the men anxiously await

The Men’s Tennis team.con-
tinued its undefeated fall séason
last weekend with victories against
UNC-Asheville and Western Caro-
lina. The Wildcats dropped only
one match all weekend, while
improving their record to 4-0.

Davidson travelled to
Asheville on Friday to take on the
Bulldogs in a Big South Confer-
ence tilt. The ‘Cats demonstrated
their depth with strong perform-
ances from number three player
Kurtis Zabell and number four
player Dave Tonidandel. Tonidan-

well at number five; Davidson

“Western ‘Carolina liad ' défédted | “on thé ¥6ad.? S4idl Frank: AB 1

UNC-A earlier this year without
their number one player, so I ex-
pected the match to be closer,” said
Frank.

In fact, the Wildcats had little
trouble in defeating the Catamounts
8-1, utilizing strong singles play
across the board to gain the vic-
tory. Zabell won easily at number
three, defeating Greg Lovelace 6-
0, 6-1.

‘Davidson’s difficulties came
in doubles. Commented Frank, “I
don’tknow ifit was playing on two
consecutive days or not, but we
didn’t _seem_ sharp.” Both the
number one and number two

don’t want to be there.” Frank was
pleased with freshmen Russell
Briggs and Ryan Harper’s straight
set victory atnumber three doubles

In upcoming action, the Wild-
cats willlookto avenge last spring’s
setback to UNCC Saturday at 10
o’clock. Both the men’s and
women’s teams will be-in action.
Coach Frank expects the Forty

bea good, close match, as always.
Last spring was the first time we
lost to them in a long time,” sad
Frank.

Harriers Awaiting
Conference Meet

In this past Saturday’s

Davidson Invitational, a 2-mile
“warm-up” for the conference:

meet, the lady Wildcats showed _

their strength by running in a tight
pack, sweeping the top six places.
This depth will be the key to
Davidson’s success this Saturday.

Coach Gary Andrew is quite

optimistic about the squad’s
chances to become Big South
Conference Champions this week-
end. The women’s hard work and
summer training has translated into
a deep squad, and the immediate
impact of freshmen Marshall,
DeMoss, and Sitek has gone a long
way toward fulfilling Andrew’s
goal of a conference champion-
ship.
