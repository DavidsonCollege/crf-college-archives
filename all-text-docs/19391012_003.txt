Question

oO : the Week |

The question for this week is one |
which has caused much talk around |
the campus, as it is the first time |

this idea has ever ‘been thought}

of. The question is this: Do you}

think the Christmas set of dances |
should have been postponed in favor

of three sets in the spring?”
Tom Cauble, Junior:

Albert Winn, Sophomore:

“Yes, Christmas dances have al-

Christmas and looking forward to

the next two or three weeks. Then,
too, the girls don't care to come, and
have a hard-time getting permission
from their schools to leave the
campus, at a time so near the holi-
days. I think the new plan is quite
an improvement,”

Oh, Mr. Ripley!

If Robert L. Ripley had been

For on that day a pane of ord-

it or not! Jack Clark,
sophomore rooming in 301 Watts,
noticed that one of his window
panes was loose, and placed his
hand against it. It teetered on
the window sill, and fell to the

tinkle, only a dull thud was
heard.

Jack went down, picked up the
glass, and returned it-to—his_|!
room. As far as the Davidsonian
is

knows, it still loose, but at

least uncracked.
