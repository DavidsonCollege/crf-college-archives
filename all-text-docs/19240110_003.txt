FAMOUS MEN ADDRESS SEVEN

and hot were the views presented, and the
result was a broadening of outlook for all
and a better appreciation of the point of view
of students from all parts of the country
and from foreign countries. The large ma-
jority of students approved the League of
Nations or some form of World Court as
the best means of solving the problems cul-
minating in war.

The heart of the message of each of the
leading speakers may be rather inadequately
expressed as follows:

Kennedy, of London: Religion is an es-
sential basis for rational thinking .

Blanchard, labor advocate: Modern in-
dustrial relations denies a man human free-
dom, which condition could be met by giving
the laborer a living wage and an eight-hour
day, bythe employer bearing the risks of
unemployment, by a measure of joint control
of labor and capital, and by a measure of
co-operative ownership.

King, negro professor from Atlanta: Each

| race has its contribution which it may give
‘to the race as a whole if given the chance.
| Dr. Paul Harrison, medical missionary to
| Arabia: What people in other lands want
|is not creed, dogma or dogmatism, but Jesus
| Christ and the right hand of fellowship.
| Hon. Newton Rowle, Canadian delegate to
\the Peace Conference: Christian idealism
can and must be practically applied to inter-
|national affairs. :
| Dr. Tsu, of Shanghai, China:
lof race superiority is a fallacy.
| Sherwood Eddy: The youth of the world
is revolting against autocracy, materialism,
\industrialism, political graft, racial unrest,
| militarism; is America 98 per cent all right
| with its vast concentration of wealth, with
jits lawlessness, with its child and woman
labor, with its industrial and racial au-
tocracy ?

Robert E. Speer: There are needs in a
changing world, but there cannot be a new
day without enough new men; the need is
for men who are willing to “burn their

Jesus Christ as the only means of solution
for its problems, ~

John R. Mott: This is a great generation.
Christ has the right to control us. No man
ever drifts into greatness. What can you
endure? Christ has never yet misdirected a
life. Ours must be the task to
Christ.”

Canon Wood, of England, gave a series of
four lectures on What Do We Believe About
God, About Sin and Forgiveness, About the
Kingdom of God, and About the Source of
Power. It is interesting,to note that it was
reported that a mang§®uld not be found in
the United States to talk on these subjects,
who was satisfactory to both Fundamental-
ists and Modernists, so Canon Wood was
summoned from England.

Numerous luncheons and social events were
held during the days of the convention, leav-
ing a touch of pleasantness long-to-he-re-

learning nothing as he lives. And in the
second place, there is so little a place in our
lives for deliberate thought. This is in thie
face of the fact that the only solution of
problems confronting us today lies in ra-
tional thinking. Yet only as the Christian
spirit is diffused through this thinking and
becomes the core and pith of it can even
rational thinking lead onward. In the words
of leading Japanese and British statestaen |
at the Disarmament Conference, “The hope |
of the world lies in the hands of tfhe Chris-
tian leaders.” To them, to the present gen-
eration of students, is being passed on aj}
duty, an opportunity, a pressing obligation
of leadership. |

The orchestra gave several special sclec- |
tions, which were thoroughly enjoyed. A

at 6:00 o'clock. It is intended- to make this
a permanent arrangement should the students
desire to continue it.

SELSER AND HURD. SPEND _ .!
FIVE HOURS UNDER ARREST |

After being detained for five hours by the
municipal and county authorities of Unadilla
and Pinehurst, Dooley County, Georgia, J.
M. Selser, assistant business manager of the
Magazine, who in company with the business
manager was on his way to Atlanta to se-
cure advertising for the Magazine, was al-
lowed to continue his journey. The arrest
of Selser took place on December 28th, at
Unadilla. The warrant was sworn out in
Pinehurst and the prisoner was turned over
to the sheriff of Dooley County, whose office
is in Vienna. The police of’ Unadilla who
made the arrest were ignorant of the
charges, so when the sheriff arrived they
had to go to Pinehurst to ascertain the!
reason for the arrest. The Police at Pine-
hurst only knew that a citizen of that town
had reported Selser for violating the state
road laws as he. passed through there the
previous week, The manner of the violation
is not known. The authorities of Pinehurst
admit that it was not speeding.

After much probing of the affair it seems
that the whole affair. arose because a 25-foot
road was not wide enough for a citizen of
Pinehurst to operate his car on, It seems |
that the citizen who caused the trouble, and |
who could settle the matter if he would,
thinks that Selser's horn is tuned to a note |
that lacks the respect which he feels the
traveling public owes him.

As the man with the injured dignity re-
the difficulty out of court,
Selser was allowed to continue his journey
after giving bond to appear at the Dooley

County court on the second Monday after

the first day in February. _

An amazing discovery was made in con- |
nection with the above affair. . It is aptly
expressed in the words of the Chief of Po-
lice of Pinchurst, Georgia, “Well, son, you |
may not know it, but the police are right |
often used by people for a gun barrel, to
shoot other folks through.”

There are of course other minor details
which cannot be discussed on account of the
limited space. And then it is not the policy
of those concerned to ridicule the majesty of
the law, or to hint that there is anything
about Pinehurst which savors of the small
back-country town,

HEARD AT INDIANAPOLIS

(Continued from page 2)
Vhe race problem furnished the topic

for more discussions than any other one

subject. Out of 50 discussion groups, 41}

of them discussed this vital question, |
‘while 35 out of 50 discussed war. Lynch- |
ing was condemned but no feasible plan |
‘offered to eradicate it.

A student movement as a “League of |
| Youth” was discussed and proved to be}
very popular, The convention was warn- |
ed against allowing such a movement to!
ifall intowsuch pitfalls as those of Europe
have done, especially to guard against |
allowing it to become contaminated with
politics as is the case in Germany and |
Hungary. :

During the convention the Executive |
Committee of the Student Volunteer |
Movement rejected a proposal’ of the!
American Student Fellowship for Chris- |

lamalgamate and promote home missions
as well as foreign. \
