Grease Fire Damaging,
But Union Still Stands

By BOB TRAVERS
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Fire in the Union snack bar
Monday night caused consider-
able damage to the grill, the soft
drink: dispensers and the walls
and ceiling around the bar.

The damage may be repaired
within a week or 10 days. ac-
cording to Grover Meetze, direc-
tor of the physical plant. He
added that a contractor is ready
to proceed with the work as
soon as materials can be ob-
tained.

The fire, which broke out
about 7:45 p.m. started on the
grill at the snack bar where
grease from the deep frying

unit caught fire.

John Word, assistant to an
official from Slater’s regional of.
fice in Atlanta. who has been
at Davidson for several days,
was at the Union when the fire
occurred. He estimated tha: it
“took about 10 minutes to put ft
out. “The students,’’ he com-
mented, “put the fire out before
the fire department arrived.”

The stainless steel hood over
the grill was damaged and glass
on the counter opposite the grill
was cracked from the heat
caused by the fire. The heat
also damaged two plastic soft
drink dispensers and the sign
over the snack bar. The ceil-

Is Elected

New Handbook Editor

By TED WINTER
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Upperclassmen gave junior
Alva Whitehead 210 votes to win
Wednesday's election for editor
of next year’s Wildcat Hand-
book. Gary DeVane, Whitehead’s
opponent, drew 140 ballots in the
election, which was originally
scheduled for Monday.

The candidates were nominat-
ed by 1965 Editor Britt Snider
and were approved by the Pub-
lications Board. Both nominees
worked under Snider on this
year's Handbook: Whitehead as
associate editor and DeVane as
section editor on. orientation.

Whitehead’s platform in last
week's DAVIDSONIAN called
for a broadening of the scope of
the Handbook and a continued
integration of its purpose as
orientation and information for
freshmen and a “handy refer-
ence guide for upperclassmen.”

‘Nothing in the past Handbook
can be left out,’ Whitehead ex-
plained. so that it will be neces-
sary to ‘‘get more information

into the same space this year.”’.

Changes called for in White-
head’s platform include a new
map of Davidson with faculty
homes indicated, revised tele-
phone listings for nearby girls’
schools and earlier deadlines for
the section editors.

After his election Wednesday
Whitehead said that he feels,
“DeVane’s platform has some
good ideas which I hope to use
also.’’ Among these he indicated
more thorough evaluation of the
rush system and bus schedules
and car rental information from
Charlotte.

In order to ‘better serve the
freshman class next year, the
new editor hopes to include on
his staff some freshmen or
freshman hall counselors from
this year. He urges any student
interested in working on the
Handbook or with ideas for it to
contact him at any time.

Whitehead. who is from Lake
City. S. C.. is also a member. of
the Honor Cour’ and of Pi Kap-
pa Alpha.

First Stimulus Group
Organized By YMCA

By MIKE HARRINGTON
Davidsonian Associate Editor
A young Davidson professor, waving his fist, stamp-
ed his foot vigorously defending his view of justice in

Tillich’'s philosophy against

the skillful objections of a

senior and two other Davidson professors.

Several other underclassmen
joined in the fray, adding down-
right naivete and shrewd sar-
casm to the discussion. Words
flew both methodically and hap-
hazardly in the living room of a
fraternity house Monday eve-
ning among six Davidson profes-
sors and 1! Davidson students.
No grades nor class attendance
was -even remotely involved in
this no-holds-barred intellectual
fray.

The occasion? The YMCA’‘s
new intellectual pitch, ‘Stimu-
lus,” a voluntary grouping of
Davidson students and profes-
sors meeting once a menth to
discuss some idea or topic of
current interest to ‘the intellec-
tual .world. Its purpose’ and
style blazed through at .its Oc-
tober meeting Monday at the Pi
Kappa Phi. fraternity house,

The topic? For October, Paul
Tillich’s Love, Power and Jus-
tice. Each member of the group
had read this short work on
his own and gathered that night
to discuss whatever contents and
applications he found interest-
ing.

For this particular meeting
two professors opened the dis.
cussion with a few summaries:
A professor from the Bible De-
partment gave a brief summary
and a member of the Political
Science Department drew paral-
lels to American involvement in
Viet Nam, the racial situation
in the United States and the
general criminal code.

Then the fun began. Almost
before the political science pro-
fessor had finished. an English
professor was almost incoherent
with objections. Each member
of the group could speak when
and as he liked—and all did,
usually at once. The modera-
tor, Paul Simpson, had suggest-
ed that there be some limit or
interval between barbs but this
seemed immediately forgotten.

There was an assumption of
equality between student and
professor in that intellectual
brawl—each man’s points were
listened to and debated, some-
times with varying degrees of
sarcasm and roughness that
more than once were turned
back on their originators.

Chaplain Will Terry’s brain-
child, the YMCA program
“Stimulus,” was considered an
unqualified success by the other
Davidson students ranged in
chairs throughout the living
room—most of whom were not

a little startled at hearing pro-

fessors argue among. them-
selves.
“Stimulus” is a discussion

group composed of 11 students
and six professors: this partic-
ular group has a closed mem-
bership and is unconcerned
about its audience. Its avowed
purpose is to create and sus-
tain interest in intellectual top-
ics outside the classroom for its
individual members and through
them to-the rest of the campus.

“Stimulus” is not a campus-
wide organization. though it con-
tains students from every class
and professors from most de-
partments; but as students and
professors indicate interest in
this sort of thing. the YMCA
hopes fo form more ‘‘stimulus”
groups.

Each member has the respon-
sibility of preparing for the
topic to be discussed. to be
present at the discussion and
to make whatever contribution
he can to the discussion. There
are no direct penalties or re-
wards for either lack of pre-
paredness or special effort—
save in the individual. And the
feeling of participation and ac-
complishment in intellectual
competition is one that can't
be duplicated elsewhere.

The members of this first
“Stimulus” group are as fol-
lows: Professors George Aber-
neth, Charles Lloyd, Ernie Pat-
terson, Dan Rhodes, Phillip Se-
cor, Locke White: Sentors Paul
Simpson, Ken Childs, Jay Feder-
man, Bob Holladay, Charlie
Turner; Juniors Wayne Rhodes,
Chip Robertson, Charile Vick;
and Sophomores Sam Hatcher,
Mike Mooty. Paul Monk.

“Stimulus” has already pro-
duced a few concrete results:
students, who listened to the
discussion Monday night, who
before couldn't have cared less
about “‘intellectualizing” outside
the classroom now have a new
slant on this phrase of college
life. And some of them are
eager to participate themselves.

Whethe. or not the Y's first
“Stimulus” will survive depends
primarily upon the interest of
the men involved, many of
whom are pretty heavily com-
mitted else: here in campus af-
fairs. But other ‘Stimulus’
groups could be real godsends
to other m*n on campus who
have the desire for this kind of
pleasure but don’t know where
to start.

ing was severely burned and the
wall blackened by the fire itself.

“It's fortunate that we didn’t
have more damage.”’ comment-
ed Meetze, who said he couldn't
estimate the cost of the overall
damage because he had no idea
how much it would cost to re-
pair the damage to the stainless
steel in the snack bar area.

There was no real structural
damage. according to Meetze.
but he explained that repair
work would be costly because
there may have been as much
as $500 worth of damage done
to the ceiling alone.

The college. said Meetze, is
most anxious to avoid delays in
tepair work so that the snack
bar will be able to reopen as
soon as possible.

to ask, and then answer for himself, the question, “Why

on the part of his audience
about heretofore blindly accept-
ed ideas and ideals.

About democracy, Canzoneri
stated, ‘“‘When we start talking
about democracy we presup-
pose that there Is a correct de-
cision and a political method
set up which makes this cor-
rect decision."

The Constitution is supposed
to help to make these correct
decisions, but still we can’t go
back to tradtion to really an-
swer the question ‘Why democ-
racy?"’ ‘And we can't say that
‘God ordained it’ because that's
presupposing that we know what
God ordained,”” Canzorei added.

“Some say that our form of
government. is the best because

mented Canzoneri, ‘‘yet our .
government has made some
gross errors. The system does
not exist because it is a fool-
proof method of deciding what's
right. This concept of democ-
racy is invalid.”

ry

Next Canzoneri questioned the
reasons for preserving society.
“Why save it?’’ he asked. ‘‘Why
are we preserving the white
race? Is it of aesthetic value?
That's the only reason I can
conceive of. and looking at your
faces I'm not even sure of that.
We only want to make ourselves
important. We say ‘We have a
destiny which God ordained’,
but we don’t know what God

On the question of human dig-
nity Canzoneri asked “What is
sd dignified about man? Why
is a creature valuable except
to himself?” Here is the vital

for ‘“‘the-human race may not
be important in the great
scheme of things, but it does
matter that I might be killed,
my wife... you."

Man is concerned only with
that which touches himself, and
this is the réal reason why he
seeks to preserve his kind or
his race. It is also the rea-
son we believe democracy to
be right.

A government should exist for
the pleasure of the individual.
for “Man is the only unit of
value in a society.’’ A democ-
tracy is the only government
where man ‘might blow him-
self off the earth, but in which

Democracy is the only source of
