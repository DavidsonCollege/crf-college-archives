Letters To The
Editor....

Dear Ed, — -

It has been my intention to write this
letter to the Davidsonian ever since my
arrival at old D.C., this term, but due
to my procrastinating nature, ! have de-
layed its writing until now. An incident
of Sunday night last gave me the final
spur of action.

As we all know, the old hill upon which
North

sided, was leveled by an earth moving con-

and South Dormitories once re-
cern during the summer months. At that
time, numerous iron pipes, large concrete
foundation blocks, and other materials
were uncovered only to be left around the
edges of the field, These things, together
with two large telephone poles which were
pushed into the space between the dorms
and Chambers have become two very bad
eye sores on our campus and someone
should see that they are removed, When
I say remove, [ mean just that and not
merely moved, tor it was the moving of
the telephone poles that caused me to take
action,

I had to the
position of the poles that I had learned to

become so accustomed
step over them in the dark. As [ made
my way to-vespers last Sunday night, “1
stepped over the place where the first
pole should have been, walked on for
five or six feet and suddenly found my-
self face to face with mother earth. Some-
one had moved and not removed those
poles. 1 did not lose my temper, however,
but merely said, “Oh fudge!”, and ‘hobbled
on to vespers. As everyone knows, I am
a touch football player of no mean abil-
ity_and_it has become a_seriousloss—te
my team because of my injury. I there-
fore wish to plead with the administration
to clean up that spot in the interest of

beauty and of safety.

Respectfully,

Brothers Mac Jeffries and Dick

at the University of S. C., was Al
Harris’ guest and also along for

picking hay out of their hair at
breakfast Monday morning.

JIM JACKSON

Joe Bachman, the Virginia moun-
tain boy who has gained such a
wide reputation as _ philosopher,
soothsayer and wit, has proposed
a football game to end all gridiron
activities. Smoothing his golden
curls with practiced hand and gaz-
ing into the future with the vision

-of-a—sports writer spotting points

on Saturday’s games, Hairless Joe
expresses the hope that he might
some day witness. a contest be-
tween a team composed of Phi
Beta Kappas and an aggregation
of ODKs. What a struggle that
would be: the Phi Betes with their
complex plays versus the ODKs
with their spirit and personality!
Joe saw the VMI game and Joe
wasn’t quite satisfied. However,
there took place one incident which
neither Phi Bete nor ODK, Fresh-
man nor Senior, man nor beast, can
expect to see again. I speak of the
saga of the Great White God of
Gastonia, Buddy Whitesides.
Buddy has three great ambitions
in his college work. One is to be
a doctor, another to sing in the
Glee Club, and the third’ to prove
to all mankind that he can play
football. After this year at David-
son-and-three more at. med school,
the first ambition will probably be
realized. After the football sea-
son there will be time for glee
clubbing of unrestricted nature.
Last Saturday, Buddy almost ful-
filled his third and greatest ambi-

tion, but cruel Fate
budding opportunity.

When Coach Story eyed the Da-
vidson bench for reserve strength,
with which to stem the tide of Key-
det touchdowns, his discerning
glance came to rest on the eager,
determined face of Sir Edward.
That was enough for the Coach,
and when his name was called, that
was enough for Whitesides. All the
pent-up fury of long afternoons of
rugged practice were ready to be
loosed. On the first play, Buddy
charged in from his defensive tackle
position to smash a host of V. M. I.
interferers.

When Buddy arose, his pace had
slowed somewhat. His grimy coun-
tenance proved the valor of his ef-
fort. Buddy was no flash in the
pan. Johnny Walker and Easy
Rhodes grabbed him as he made
for the V. M. I. huddle, determined
to analyze the next play. Buddy
erouched in position, his* muscles
like steel springs. ‘They remained
like steel springs as a host of Key-
dets swept past. All Buddy could
mustey in reply to Walker’s queries
was, a long, drawn out “Whooooo-
eeeee.” The loudspeaker announced
that Sharpe had replaced. White-
sides at tackle for Davidson. With
spinning brain, Buddy returned to
the bench, too dazed to accept the
date with a beautiful blonde that
night. But opportunity will come
again!
