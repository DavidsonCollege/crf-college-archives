Taub tickles the ivories

By Susan RuGciEro
Arts and Living Editor

Robert Taub, winner of some
of the most coveted international
prizes in piano performance, will
share his talent with the Davidson
community November 7 and 8 in
Hodson Hall.

At 8 p.m. on the 7th he will be
performing Beethoven’s Sonata in
D minor, as well as his Sonatain B-
flat major, written for the
Hammerklavier.

In addition to that recital he
will also be speaking to middle
school students and Davidson
College’s Music in Western Civi-
lization class on the 8th, as well as

giving a master class for piano
students, in which four students
will also perform.

Taub, who received the high-
estaward in piano from The Julliard
School, has performed at Lincoln
Center, the Kennedy Center and
Avery Fisher Hall.

He is a Phi Beta Kappa gradu-
ate of Princeton where he was a

- University Scholar. The pianist is

a Steinway Artist and is currently
recording the complete Beethoven
Sonata cycle.

He has performed with the
San Francisco Symphony, Phila-
delphia Orchestra, Los Angeles
Philharmonic, Montreal Sym-
phony, BBC Philharmonic and

Hong Kong Philharmonic.

He has performed throughout
the United States, Europe, the Far
East, and Latin America, and was
highlighted by The New York
Times in their year-end review
“Year in the Arts.” re

He has given world premiers
in Los Angeles and London, of
which the concerto from the former
won the 1990 Pulitzer Prize.

Taub’s repertoire embraces
music from the Baroque era to the
present day, and he has been cho-
sen by contemporary American
composers to create their music.

Taub has been honored since
1994 as the Artist-in-Residence for
the Institute for Advanced Study.

well as take advantage of some of
their own homemade rules. The
speaker, one of the two boys who
went into the home thinking of one
day being a priest, clings onto his
religion ina sort of in-the- viewer’s
face way, which could be too harsh,
but is warranted given the enor-
mity of the atrocities he and his
friends suffer.

The transition from life in
Wilkinson to 1981 is well done.
Not only does clothing and music
change as the characters age, but
the tiniest background details do
as well — it was interesting to see
label names on drug store items

change with the time. The four
boys became men scarred by their
experiences as sleepers — two are
criminals; the speaker is alow man

on the totem pole for a newspaper, .

and the fourth is a lawyer with a
plan relying on a Mafia kingpin, a
drug lord, police corruption, and
broken clergy vows, all of which
are prevalent in New York, but
subtracted from the reality of a
supposedly true story. When the
two criminals encounter a guard
responsible for their torture, they
are finally in a position to retaliate.
Atrial results in which all the char-
acters play a part and Father Bobby
faces his decision. :

As an avid fan of criminol-
ogy, I thoroughly enjoyed the
movie. I was disappointed only by
the form of revenge taken — I

wanted more torture, but I am also
far too intrigued by Charles
Manson and his cronies. My
brother, on the other hand, finds it
hard to recommend the movie be-
cause of its gore.

I concede by saying that it
isn’t for everyone; it includes very
brutal acts that are sometimes a
reality in poorly supervised boys’
homes, run by perverted guards
with way too much power.

. Itdoesn’tleave the viewer nec-
essarily uplifted — it mixes the
ending scene of the four friends
reminiscing with their ever loyal
female companion with the bloody,
decomposing bodies of two of the
men — but the viewer is warned of
the outcome at the beginning, as
well as by hints of the brutality that
are to follow.
