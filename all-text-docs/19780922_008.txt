Letter to the Edito

Former DC student
advises critical look

To the Editor:

Nine ths have passed
since I decidsd to leave David-
son College. Few of you will
make that decision, yet.each of
you may benefit from making a
conscious, deliberate decision to
stay at Davidson.

It follows that such a process
would require a few hours,
maybe a few days of reflection,
introspection and questioning.
You might find this process
painful; idealistic views tend to
tarnish under scrutiny. Yet the

—end result-might-prove an-

affirmation of your decision to
attend, teach or work at David-
son or possibly provide you
with a more realistic appraisal
of the Community. ,

Below is an excerpt from my
transfer application. Last year,
while I was a member of the
Davidson College Cammiunity,
I spent many hours looking at
the Community, .exploring the
Community. My inquiry led to
this summary:

“Davidson is a regional, libe-
ral arts college that has strong
ties to the Presbyterian Church
and to the South. Adjectives
that come to mind include
conservative, academic, pater-
nal, structured, and homoge-
neous.

“My dissatisfaction lies with
the fundamental attitudes of
the college. I have a strong
conviction that my participa-
tion in any institution should be
dynamic -- F want to challenge
and to be challenged. I will not
close my eyes to events or
attitudes that I find objection-
able; I will not silently watch
people treated unjustly:

I strive to work within the
guidelines tu affect a change; I

.. channel a great deal of evergy

into my activities. Unless 1 am
actively seeking a change in’
these situations (and I have
hopes of succeeding), I feel that
my participation in any institu-
tion should signify my accep-
tance of the major philosophies
and actions of that institution.
“My dealings with Davidson
have convinced me that the
undercurrent philosophy of the
college is static by nature. I feel
stymied here. The Academic
Vice President has publicly
stated that students who do not
agree with the school's policies

and the current interpretations —
should consider leaving since“

many students who wanted to
come to Davidson, and who
were willing to come under the
current situation, were turned
do--. The tokenism in the
acceptance of stwlents and in
the hiring of faculty members
insures a homogeneous college
community.

“A more tangible dissatisfac-
tion I have deals with the lack
of academic and personal oppor-
tunities for varied college expe-
riences. Double majors are not
alowed, even if the proper
credits are earned.

“The school recently became
a coed institution. Many faculty
members still object to women
on campus. A prevalent atti-
tude is that Davidson is a
“men's and girls’ school” -- an
attitude that I find harmful as
well as objectionable. A conser-
vative air weighs heavily upon
the Davidson College Commu-
nity.
“Academically, I have b
successful at Davidson and/ I
am fully capable of doing so‘
the future. My decision to leave
Davidson grew out of a careful.
consideration of what I can
hope to gain at Davidson versus
what I could possibly find at a
different institution.

“T have come to know better

what I want academically and ~

personally from my college ex-
perience. I decided to leave
Davidson when I came to the
realization that I would not be
able to fulfill many of my goals
or experience many things of
value if I remained. Thus, I am
not willing to remain at David-
son after this academic year.”’
--excerpt from my application
to Wesleyan University
February 18, 1978

This letter finalizes a process
that began nine months ago; it
represents a final break with the
Davdson College Community
proper.

As to my motivations, this
letter illustrates a viewpoint
that hopefully will present a
challenge -- not a challenge to
seek justification, rather a chal-
lenge to quest for a personal
understanding of you commit-
ment to any institution or
community, particularly the
one we shared.

In the coming weeks, the
U.S. Senate and then the House
will be considering the compo-
nent of President Carter's pro-
posed energy program which
deals with natural gas deregula-
tion. In contradiction to a
repeatedly affirmed position
during his Presidential cam-
paign, Carter has since yielded
to the oil industry’s appeal for
removing the federal ceiling on
the price of natural gas sold
interstate. The anti-consumer
‘consequences of such legislation
would be devastating.

The world

Davidson PIRG

If enacted, this biil will
unnecessarily cost consumers
tens of billions of dollars. A
study by the non-partisan Con-
gressional Budget Office con.
firmed that as early as 1982 the
price could be $4.00 per thou-
sand cubic feet (M.C.F.), 2.174
percent increase from the pres-
ent cost of $1.46 M.C.F. The
Consumer Federation of Amer-
ica issued an estimate last
month revealing that decon-
trolled gas would reach an
average level by 1985 of at least
353, percent of its present cost,
618 percent of what it was in
1975 and 1,608 percent of what

it was in 1970.

' Higher prices have been ed-

phemistically justified by their

proponents as incentives for

increased production, a conver-

sion to other energy sources, .

and conservation in consump- _

tion. Experience since 1970,
however, demonstrates that e-
ven 100 percent price increases
have failed to yield greater
output. Apparently gas produ-
cers, with monopolistic com-
-nand over their markets, have
preferred augmenting their pro-
fits by restricting supply.

In Texas, a state exempt
from federal price limits and
thus the best indication of what
the whole nation can anticipate.
the cost of natural gas has
jumped 600 percent since 1973.

Explaining his role in relation to WDAV,
Spencer continued: “I have to go by the
Trustees’ policy statement and if that’s in
conflict, the Constitution ought to be .
brought into consonance.”

’ The message seems clear. When the
College’s highest governors establish
policy, the procedures, rights, and re-
sponsibilities ensconced in the constitu-
tion. are vulnerable to malicious neglect.
| and arbitrary manipulation. If you do not
m4. | believe that such rights and privileges are

«| important, no big deal. But if you assume

witness.

Yet total production for the
Texas market has declined in
the same period almost 20
percent. ;

‘If the government's objective
is indeed to promote more
plentiful forms of energy, a
more effective approach would
be to directly assist the devel-
opment of alternative energy
technology.

The fact that more than 89.

percent of the electricity in
Texas was still fenerated by
natural gas last year does not

-help the argument that higher

prices would encourage conver-
sion.

Practically and economically
speaking, conservation is not a
viable option. The ability of
residential users of natural gas
to significantly reduce their
consumption is very minimal.
An attempt to restrict energy
usage by industry would im-
pede optimal capacity and con-
tribute to the rate of unemploy-
ment.

It is painfully clear that the
most vulnerable members of
society, low-income consumers
(particularly senior citizens),
will be the most cruelly affected
by gas deregulation. Propor-
tionally, the lowest ten percent

on the economic ladder spends -

ten times more of its income on
home energy consumption than
does the top ten percent. This is

in part due to the poor condition

of the housing they occupy.

Declining block utility rate
structures that charge low-vol-
ume users at a higher unit raté
than high-volume users is also
responsible for the dispropor-
tionate burden of natural gas
price increases. ;

The emotional price to senior
citizens and low-income con-
sumers is particularly high. In
November 1977, a University of
Michigan study predicted that
last winter one out of five senior
citizens would have to face the
choice of either paying their
utility bill or eating. These
people are often victims of
utility shut-offs, going for
months without heat and be-
coming ill as a result—and in
some cases freezing to death.

The increase in the price of
natural gas as a result of
deregulation would have other
consequences:

that institutions of higher learning should
demonstrate and teach respect for demo-
cratic participation in a constitutional-
ly-based society, the mishandling of
Davidson’s constitution is.a sad event-to

—Philip Duncan

Deregulation means hardships

—Higher unemployment as
increased spending on energy
reduces aggregate demand for
other goods and services.

—Higher numbers of senior
citizens forced to enter nursing
homes or become wards of the
state because they are no longer
able to make ends meet on their
meager fixed incomes (as a
recent Michigan study con-
firms). :

—Increased health-care costs
due to poorer diets and colder
living conditions.

~— Increased inflation in all
production sectors (not just
energy); virtually all produc-
tion, including agriculture, is
energy intensive.

—Increased economic and
political power for the already
extremely powerful major oil
and gas firms. Despite incomes
they consider too meager for
energy production, they have
spent hundreds of millions of
dollars advancing their posi-
tions on issues ranging fro->n
environmental policy to corpor-
ate tax rates. Further, the
major oi] companies will con-
tinue to use their enormous cash
surpluses to purchase major
non-energy firms such as Mo-
bil’s purchase of Montgomery
Ward.

—Worsening of the balance
of trade. The price increase in
domestically manufactured
commodities would make them
Tess attractive to the rest of the
world and thus reduce us ex-
ports.

On the Senate floor an at-
tempt has been pledged to
delete the sections of the com-
mittee bill which would decon-
trol natural gas prices. The
public is being told that these
Senators are ruining any chance
of creating a national energy
program.

In truth, the Senators who
are not willing to settle for the
‘anything is better than no-
thing’’ mentality are owed a
debt of gratitude by the public.

It fa clear thet the “moral
equivalent of war’’ President
Carter solicited of the American
public againet the energy crisis
should, in fact, be waged
against the President's own
proposals,
