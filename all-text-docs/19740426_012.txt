The team has fared well in
its six matches, losing only on-

Ruggers Ramble Past Duke

By ANN BODE
Staff Writer

In two recent away matches
against two strong, veteran
squads, the Davidson Rugby
Football Club experienced
first a rousing victory and
then bitter defeat.

Davidson’s victory came as
the Ruggers rolled over Duke
20-4. Eight points of David-
son’s 20 came during the first
half.

Pat Cochran was the first
D.C. Rugger to touch down the
ball in the end zone. His try
came from precision team-
work in the scrum.

Duke backs muffed a pass
and the ready Davidson for-

ward pack rushed the loose
ball into the end zone where
Cochran fell on the ball for
four points.

Davidson's second try came
as rookie Chris Young, run-
ning like a veteran player,
received the ball from a line of
perfect! «~-~-:*-4 passes and
powered his way into the end
zone.

Wildcat Ruggers played an
even more powerful second
half. Bob Jacobs charged into
touch after receiving the ball
from Ted Ellett about ten
yards from the goal. Dave Kit-
trell incrased the value of the
try with a two point kick-after-

try. .
Kittrell added six more

hit, but Manire pitched out of
the difficulty.
Ingold hit a one out homer in
the third, and the Cats went in-
to the bottom of the fifth down
5-1. After two outs and a Year-
wood walk, a double by Stone,
Pomeroy’s single, and a
double by Weicker put the
Cats ahead 5-4.

In the seventh, three walks,
an error by Rodgman and a
wild pitch tied the score.

Stevens summoned Frank
Folger to put out the fire with
two on and two out, and Folger
ey Oe See ene

raced home with the winning
run.

On Monday, Butch Dziaduls
and Mike Dean drove in two
runs apiece as second place
Appalachian took the Cats 7-1.
The Cats scored only one on
Weicker’s sacrifice fly. The

points to the Davidson score
after one of his typically
amazing runs resulted in a try
for which he again kicked two
extra points.

According to team captain
Ted Ellett, ‘the Duke game
was Davidson’s best effort all
season.’’ Unfortunately, the
team could not sustain that ef-
fort the next week in a
disasterous game against
Virginia Tech.

Davidson backs had grave
problems in moving the ball
down the field. Hookie backs
were usually able to stop any
Davidson movement. The one
exception came when Richard
Hendrix charged through for
Davidson's one try.

On Saturday, Davidson
Ruggers will face Roanoke
and Winston-Salem at David-
son. These games should
provide real excitement for
the Spring Frolics weekend.

responsibilty ofTornee. He has
been fairly consistent all
spring, scoring or assisting on
goals in every game.

Other notable standouts
have been fullbacks Paul
Parker and Bill Vaughn; half-
backs Bill Giduz, Bob Griz-
zard, Gordon Maner, and Billy
Hawk; and strikers Jack
Linard and George Yancey.

The reserves are star-
studded too, with the likes of
Maddry Harrell, Tenafly
Swanson, Dave Richardson,
and sometimes on a good Sun-
day even Chip Stone.

As for the progression of the
club into the varsity's fall
season, many hopes are being
entertained by coach and
player alike.

Some of the team’s mem-
bers are anxiously looking for-
ward to the summer when
they may get the opportunity
to study and play soccer in
England and Scotland.

Looking ahead to the fall
season, the Cats have their

difference.

Rugged as the man who wears them, too.
Because Bass builds quality and character
into every pair of shoes they make. Fine
leathers and.careful hand detailing make the

longest and toughest road
ahead of them. The Cats
tangle with Madison College,
UNC-Chapel Hill, Duke, and
NC State; all powerhouses in
collegiate soccer.

Davidson plays a deman-
ding 16 game schedule which
includes participation in the
weekend Campbell Classic
tournament at Buies Creek
versus three other teams. The
Southern Conference Cham-
pionship game will be on our
field if we win our half of the
division.

With an impressive slate
against competition like this,
the Cats could be touted for
post-season play.

Davidson will also hold its
first summer soccer in-

structional camp. The first
session will be held July 20-26
and the second session will run
from July 28 - Aug. 2. All
youngsters high school age
and under are eligible to at-
tend.
