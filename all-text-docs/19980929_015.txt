Excitement was once again the
story of the Wildcat volleyball match
against the Western Carolina Cata-
mounts on Saturday, September 26 at
Belk Arena.
The match set
up a contest
between two
Southern
Conference rivals with identical records,
but Davidson prevailed 3 games to 0.

The crucial, close game proved to
be game one. The Wildcats opened with
the serve and a slightly different start-
ing lineup. Katherine Lorenz began the
game for Jennifer Ortega. Katherine
opened with the serve for the Wildcats.
Aftera quick sideout by the Catamounts
the Wildcats responded and regained
the serve. With Gina Lawrence serving,
the first point of the match was scored
for the Wildcats on a double block by
Janet Duncan and Erica Schwartz.

The Wildcats sprinted out to a 7-1
lead. Early signs pointed in the direc-
tion of a quick win for Davidson. The
Catamounts are a strong team, and when
they began their first game comeback it
was not surprising. When the game was

The Wildcats got a side out on a
kill by Gina Lawrence. With Mara
Mordini serving the Wildcats tied the
game at 11-11. The Western Carolina
head coach called a time out. Immedi-
ately following the time out a spike by
Brooke Bentley moved the lead back to
the Wildcats.

A sideout brought the serve back
to the Catamounts, who were quick to
capitalize on the serve. They tied the
score and then retool the lead with a
block. Another point and the Cata-
mounts stood with the serve at 14-12.

It was apparent that the Wildcats
were not going to back down when they
won the serve back. After an extended

volley the Catamounts regained the '

serve briefly but lost it- when Janet
Duncan hit a hard spike past the de-
fense. With Ginny Quis now in the
game for Erica Schwartz and Brooke
Bentley serving, the Wildcats scored to
tighten the gap to 13-14. The Cata-
mounts got one more sideout but lost
the serve following a kill by Mara
Mordini. Janet Duncan took the serve
and the Wildcats scored three straight

Women’s Club Soccer ties Wake Forest

After a frustrating loss to UNC-Greensboro last weekend, the Women’s Club
Soccer Team rebounded impressively at Wake Forest last Sunday. Lacking a full
squad, the women fought with only ten players and fell to 0-2 at the half. Howe
ver, the Cats refused to be intimidated or out-run. Brittany Fuentes governed the
midfield, while goalie Amber Clark and sweeper Leila Giesenschlag steered the
defense. A few minutes into the second half, Alexis Joiner recored the team’s
first goal of the season. Emily Katzfey added to a second score in the last thirty

Arena were in an uproar.

Game two’s first point was scored
by the Catamounts, who worked their
way to a 7-5 lead. A service ace by
Katherine Lorenz brought the score to
7-6. After the serve was lost to a sideout,
a service error by the Catamounts
handed the serve to the Wildcats’ Gina
Lawrence. From that point onward, the
Wildcats did not look back. The Cata-
mounts eeked out one more point, but
the Wildcats dominated game two, win-
ning 15-8.

Victory was waiting for the Wild-
cats, who jump-started the third game
by grabbing a 7-1 lead. To their credit,
the Catamounts fought back and were
able to make arun at the lead. Down 10-
2, the Catamounts fought through a
long volley to score. They were able to
get as close as 5 points at 13-8. But after
a net violation gave the Wildcats the
serve, Brooke Bentley finished the game
with a service ace. The Wildcats won
15-8.

Individual highlights for the Wild-
cats include the stellar play of Mara
Mordini, who led the team in kills and
digs. Setter Erica Schwartz had 47 as-
sists. Four different players had at least
one service ace in the game. Junior
Ginny Quis provided a number of as-
sists in her first game back from the
injured list.

The Wildcats responded to an im-
portant game with a victory. In the
words of Head Coach Lisa Marston,
“Western Carolina is a great program
and we expected a battle.” With the
win, the Wildcats move ahead of the
Catamounts in the Southern Confer-
ence standings.
