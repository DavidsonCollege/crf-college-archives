THE DAVIDSONIAN

Page Three

Question

of the Week

A short time ago the government

began sending instructors and
equipment to a few colleges to start
an aviation unit, which was includ-
ed as a regular course. The ques-
tion for this week is:
Do you think that a government-
sponsored unit here at Davidson
would be a success, and would you
be inclined to b a ber?
Steve Fowler, senior:

Yes, I am in favor of it. It would
give to many an opportunity to fly
which they would otherwise not
get. Aviation seems to be the com-
ing thing anyway, so here would be
a chance to get in it as an activity.
Besides, it offers. training for
possible war, and it would be better
to get shot in the air than on the
ground.

discussion

a

John Withers, junior:

I do not think they would work
here at Davidson because we do
not have adequate facilities within
a reasonable distance. This is not a
mechanical school and we do not
have enough students to justify an
aviation unit. It would work better
at technical school where it would
not necessitate a change or addi-
tion of courses.

George Horton, sophomore:

I think that it would be a very
good think. I personally perfer fly-
ing on the ground with four wheels
under me; but for air-minded stu-
dents it is a good idea, I think it
would promote interest in the school
activities and would be a modern-
izing feature of the campus. It
would save several students who
are already taking aviation a lot of
time and trouble.

George Lilly, freshman:

I am for it. It affords a prepara-
tion for war and gives a chance to
show individuality. It would also
help to develop self-reliance in the
students and would give them much
valuable experience. The students
would probably have to be selected
to make it safe, but an aviation unit
would certainly make the school
more widely known.

Bob Kellogg, junior:

I am in favor of it because there
are many students here who would
like to have aviation. It would help
the boys who are preparing for
Army or Navy Schools. I do not
think it would effect the school
curriculum; but would certainly
help in making Davidson an up-to-
date active school,

Parker Connor, senior:

I do not think that an aviation
unit would go well at Davidson be-
cause in a school this size the in-
fantry is about all we can support.
This is not an engineering school,
and several courses would probably
have to be added to supplement act-
ual flying. In other schools as in
N. C. State or Georgia Tech. such
a course would be appropriate.
Boyd Flynn, sophomore:

I am in favor of this unit being
placed at Davidson. There is quite
a bit of interest here in aviation,
and it would be an excellent outlet
for such interests. It would also
furnish an opportunity for entrance
into a field of work which is com-
paritively young. The reputation of
the school will be enhanced by this
addition to its curriculum.

Bill Burch, junior:

I'm all for it. It would give those
interested in aviation a chance to
see if they wanted it for their life
work, without going into it deep
enough for it to become expensive.
It would probably bring more stu-
dents to Davidson—those who want
a liberal arts course with aviation.
An aviation unit would be inclined
to raise the standards of technical
courses, such as physics.

Jim Gamble, senior:

I don’t think it would work here.
Davidson is conservative, and fly-
ing is and should be in the hands
of liberals, There are not enough
students here to warrant such a un-
it. Even at N. C. State’ there are
only eighteen in the flying class.
It would take time to build confi-
dence in ‘the course, to interest
other students in it. I'm for it
if it would work; it would give the
school a wider range of education,
and bring it more up-to-date. Addi-
tion of technical courses, such as
theory of flight, would be required.
Dick Edwards, junior:

This is a cultural college and such
a development is contrary to the
principles of a school whose pres-
ent size is an asset. Pro arguments
are psychologically based on the
militant spirit that now surrounds
us. The radio and cinema has ex-
cited our imaginations; but a rea-
sonable thought would convince us
of its futility in a non-technical
school.

Presbyterian
Colleges Are
Book’s Topics

Presidents Discuss History and
Ideals of Respective
Institutions

Recently there was publish-
ed a small booklet which has
raised considerable interest in
the = Presbyterian Church,
“Presbyterian Colleges in the
North Carolina Synod.” In this
booklet the presidents of the
six Presbyterian colleges in
North Carolina — Davidson,
Flora MacDonald College, Mit-
chell College, Peace Junior
College, and Queens-Chicora
College, Presbyterian Junior
College—discuss their respec-
tive institutions. Dr. Walter L.
Lingle wrote the Foreword for
this booklet.

“The purpose of this little book,”
states Dr. Lingle in the Foreword,
“is to give the Presbyterians of
North Carolina specific in-
formation concerning the history,
ideals, and work of their Presbyter-
ian colleges.” The plan stated above

some

is well carried out by the heads of
the institutions.

All urged
Dr. Lingle in the Foreword to read
the booklet in order that they may
learn about, and become more in-
terested in the work that the col-

Presbyterians are

leges are doing in the field of
Christian Education. The president
of each institution expresses his

wish that anyone desiring further
information concerning the college
will not hesitate in writing and vis-
iting the college.

Easter Vesper Sermon

Monroe Pastor Discusses
Christ’s Description of

Rev. D. P. McGeachy, Jr., pastor

teenth chapter Matthew, the

of the Presbyterian Church in Mon-

Easter vesper service last Sunday
night.

Rey. McGeachy brought out the
fact that after the resurrection,

is to desire it, and once man sees |

it, his whole being will be directed

toward obtaining it. Jesus told

stories that gave a suggested de-
scription of Heaven, but He never
painted an actual descriptive pic-
ture of it. It is much easier for us
to realize what Heaven is not, than

to picture what it is. In Heaven,
there is no hatred, no abject pov-
erty, no sickness. Heaven is a place

where wars have ceased, and

in a brother-

Will of God. The love, the beauty,
and the justice of God controls all.

To see, to catch Christ’s vision

fice. Jesus once said that if a per-
son would come after Him, he must
deny himself and take op His cross
and follow Christ. Often we, who
claim to be Christians, feel that the
price of the Kingdom of Heaven is
too high, that the sacrifice is too
great.

One remember, however,
that self-denial and personal sacri-
fice are required by all professions.
The doctor, the soldier, the explor-
er, and members of all other oc-
cupations must sacrifice. Even the
Nazi and the Communist sacrifice
to further their particular type of
government. Therefore, can’t we
sacrifice in order to gain a perma-
nent kingdom? “Again, the King-
dom of Heaven is like unto a man
that is a merchant seeking. goodly
pearls; and having found one pearl
of great price, he went and sold all
that he had, and bought it.”

Converse Girls And Davidson
Cercle Francais To Present
ef Two Plays

The Davidson chapter of Le
Cercle Francais, honorary
French club, will play hosts to
the chapter at Converse Col-
lege here next Tuesday, April
18. Two plays will be present-
ed by the clubs in Chambers
Auditorium that night.

Last night the local club —visited
the Converse chapter and gave two
plays there. In “L’anglais tel Qu’on
le Parle” the two clubs cooperated
with the Converse girls taking the
feminine roles and the members of
the local club in the other parts.
The play “La Parti de Bridge” was
given entirely by the chapter here.
The Converse girls gave a reception
following the plays.

Guest Actors

On Tuesday members of
the Cercle from Converse will come
in the afternoon and be entertained
at supper by the local organization.
That evening the clubs will again
cooperate in giving “L’anglais tel
Qu’on le Parle.” “Horrible Affaire”
will replace “La Parti de Bridge”
on the program Tuesday. There will
also be a third play that night with
the Converse girls taking all the

next

roles, .
No information was available

when this went to press as to the

personnel of the Converse cast.

However, the Davidson boys tak-
ing part will be the same as those
who played recently when the club
visited Salem College. One change
in the cast was made necessary
when Dave Sprunt was unable to
enake the trip to Conyerse because
of a previous engagement. His part
was taken by Dave Colvin.

All students-are urged to attend
the plays next Tuesday. They will
be of particular interest to those
who are now taking French as all
conversation in them will be in
French. A small admission will be
charged,

Redhead Will
Speak Sunday

On Sunday evening, April 16, the
regular Sunday evening vesper ser-
vice will be led by the Reverend
J. A. Redhead, D. D., pastor of
the Second Presbyterian Church of
Charlotte.

Dr. Redhead is a familiar figure
to most of the student body, for
many came to know him well thru’
the evangelical services which were”
led by him last fall. He is the type

of speaker that attracts and ap-
peals to young men.
The Reverend Dr. Redhead is a

young man, having rather recently
graduated from the Seminary. He
has held pastorates at several oth-
in North Carolina and
other states. For the last few years

er places
he has been the pastor of the Sec-
and Presbyterian Church in Char-
lotte.
