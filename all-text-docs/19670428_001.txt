“It’s ‘68 we're aiming at,”
Johnston said. when asked about
rumors of faculty complaints
about the uncertainty of plan-

the Blue Sky Committee was
about: to propose.

Earlier in the year, Johnston
attributed the small number of
course changes scheduled for
next year to the pending action
of the committee.

Johnston said that the com-

GOLD IN THE HILLS
Black Masquers Rehearse Hungry D Run

In the constitution the faculty has put in writing its
relationship and responsibilities to the college. Until now,
the faculty has largely acted. along unwritten general | +

by virtue of precedent. 4s

Trustee approval of the faculty constitution must};
now be given at meeting of the Board of Trustees next},
weekend before the document can be enacted. r

The unanimous vote came as a surprise to Dr. Alan
B. Brinkley, chairman of the Faculty Constitution Com-

the faculty for approval.

According to Brinkley, no sub-
stantive changes were made in
the draft as a result of confer-
ring with those faculty mem
bers. He said that the changes
agreed to by the committee
were primarily alterations in
style and syntax.

Approval from the faculty for
the revised draft at the special
meeting yesterday was given
without dissent. Brinkley said
that he thought the unanimous
vote was largely the result of a
role call vote.

An alternative to the new pre.
amble was provided by the fac-
ulty in case the trustees found
the present preamble objection
able. The faculty voted to ac.
cept the preamble of the second
draft of the constitution if the
revised preamble. actually the
third preamble written by the
constitution committee. would
prevent trustee acceptance.

Brinkley is optimistic about
the chances of passage by the
Board of Trustees. Three trus-
tees including the president,
Walter Lingle. aided in drafting
the constitution, and President
D. Grier Martin has agreed to
help seek trustee acceptance of
the draft.

In essence. the preamble rec-
ognizes the primary responsibil-
ity of the Board of Trustees in
determining college policy. It
then goes on to designate the
particular areas of faculty con-
cern.

The revised preamble states,
“Legally and practically, the
Board of Trustees and the Pres-
ident of the college. as cfilef
administrative officer, are re-
sponsible for defining the pur-
pose and policies of the college.

“The faculty, however, is par-
ticularly responsible for carry-
ing out the purpose of the col-
lege ‘to teach students to think
clearly and accurately. to make
relevant and valid judgments,
to discriminate among values
and to communicate freely :with
others in the realm of ideas.’

“The faculty is thus unavoid-
ablv obligated to serve in the
formulation, enactment and im-
plementation of educational pol-
icy and of those policies which
directly and indirectly affect
educational policy."

Council Praises Faculty Constitution;

The Student Council unani-

| councils in certain areas, as pro
posed in Appendix I! of the re

tee on Student Life.

In another motion passed at
the Monday night meeting, they
‘gave the Student Body Consti-
tutional Revision Committee full
power to make all revisions they
deem necessary in revising the
constitution.

All proposals will be subject
to review by the Student Coun.

Council commended ‘“‘the far

Committee.”

They added, however, that
they felt ‘‘a much fuller use of
the student potential should be
sought."’ In order to accomplish
this. they urged the formation
of ‘‘college committees” com-
posed of faculty, administra.
tion and students, and they en-
dorsed in ‘principle the propos-
als made in Appendix II of the

{report of the Blue Sky Subcom-

mittee on Student Life.

In discussing the action taken
by the Council, President Tom
Earnhardt stated, ‘I feel that
Davidson is ready for joint com-
mittees in a number of areas.
Students at Davidson are more
than willing to serve the school
in a responsible, enthusiastic
manner. Appendix II would al-
low much greater participation
by students simply because stu-
dent opinion would be represent-
ed on an equal basis in areas of
mutual concern.”

According to Mike Bates, the
chairman of the Student Body
Constitutional Revision Com-
mittee, which also approved the
principle of Appendix I, ‘“‘The
draft we prepare will certainly
be affected by facuilty-trustee
action on this proposal. In areas
of common concern, it would
seem highly advantageous to
-have a common government, I

jthink the faculty could expect
| greater student support for leg-
islation coming out of such a
céuncil than for legislation com-
ing out of a faculty commit-
tee.”

Council Committee Plans

Revamping

By FRANKLIN ANDERSON
Assistant Managing Editor

Total rewriting of the student
body constitution is being plan-
ned by the Student Council Con-
stitution Revision Committee,
according to Mike Bates, chair-
man of the committee.

“We do not plan a simple cor-
rection or revision of the pres-
ent constitution and by-laws,”
Bates said. “Instead, we are
thinking in terms of more im-
portant changes.” :

The committee endorsed a pro
posal for a combination of fac-
ulty-student councils Monday.
The proposal. which was recom-
mended by the Student Life Sub-
committee of the Blue Sky Com-
mittee. suggests that certain
faculty committees be replaced
with five councils.

Indicating what direction the
new constitution would take.
Bates said that the committee

At this time. it is not certain,
whether student representatives
will attend the meeting, which
will be held in Charlotte.

The meeting stemmed from
the growing concern over the
local status of the fraternities
after the new plan goes into ef-
fect next year. The plan has
caused a large amount of con-
troversy since it was released
several months ago.

Covington spoke informally to
the council Tuesday night, in-
forming them of the purpose of
the May 12 meeting and answer-
ing questions.

He called the Davidson fra-
ternity system a ‘‘fraternity sys-
tem of the future.”’ He used as
justification for his statement
the extraordinary development

of the college fraternity system
and the improved relationship
between the faculty and the fra
ternities since 1964.

Constitution

“hopes to overcome needless du.
plication and conflict of student
effort and in student organiza.
tions.’*

Discussion in committee meet
ings has centered around the
senate-executive committee con
cept of student government and
the council plan:

The senate plan would place
executive power in the hands of
an executiye committee com.
posed of student beady officers
and heads of student body or
ganizations. The senate would be
elected by the student body.

A variation of the plan would
have a senate elected by organ-
izations and an executive com-
mittee composed of the student
body officers.

The council concept would
place a single body at the high.
est level of student governments.
From this position the activities
of student organizations could
be coordinated. ,

The council concept would vest
executive power in a series of
semi-autonomous committees
which would be responsible to
the council.

Bates characterized the choice
between the two plans as “‘prob-
ably the most crucial decision
we will make."

The constitution will not be
finished by the end of this year.
