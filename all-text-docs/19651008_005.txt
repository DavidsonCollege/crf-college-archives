WELCOME BACK

Jim Terry told me a couple of nights ago what he
thought the four goals of the 1965 Wildcats were.

“I think our first goal is to have a successful
season, a winning season. :

“Then, we: want to be undefeated. That’s our
second goal.

“Third is to be unscored on this year.

“Finally we want to score as much as we can
every game.”

Three weeks ago mention of any one of Terry's
“goals” would have brought snickers of laughter,
torrents of sarcasm, and maybe, from somewhere
on campus, pity for any idiot who would dare sug-
gest the impossible might be possible. But that was
three weeks ago.

It’s really too early to diagnose statistics and to
compare years past with this year, but I'll take this
opportunity to get the jump on the more conserva-
tive sports writers who have adopted the usual wait-
and-see attitude.

The first of Terry's four goals is to win. The last ,
winning season Davidson had was in 1958, probably
before half of us heard of the school. The ’Cats were
5-4 then, with two one-point wins and one two-point
victory (The Citadel, 8-6).

Secondly, Terry suggested we go undefeated.
Since Davidson first played a four-game schedule in
1896, they have never been undefeated.

In fact the Jast time Davidson was ‘unbeaten in
its first three games was 1954, and the last time
Davidson had three straight opening shutouts was
in 1918, before even most of the professors here
ever heard of the school.

As for Terry's third goal, an unscored upon team
— it’s ridiculous to look in the record books, *cause
we haven't really come close (except in 1918, 47
years ago, when we played four games and gave up
seven points to Clemson in game number four).

The best our defense has done since I was born
(1944) is to give up 74 points, which the 1954 Cats
did in compiling our best record since 1933, a 6-3
mark.

Finally Terry sets a goal to score as much as we
possibly can. We have scored 73 points in our first
three contests. Not since 1946 have we done as well
as when we beat Erskine 74-0 in our opener and took
Wofford 54-0 in the second contest.

The last time we won two conference games was
in 1958, and since the modern Southern Conference
was formed in 1952, we have never won more than
that.

| couldn’t say enough good about Davidson foot-
ball now. Last year I couldn’t say any good about it.

Nobody who claimed sanity would begin to sug-
gest, or even hint, Davidson will be undefeated,
untied, and unscored upon this season, and I do
claim sanity.

But then nobody who claimed sanity would have
suggested we might have been undefeated, untied,
and unscored upon in our first three games; after all,
it had been 47 years since we did it before.

At any rate 'Cats, welcome back to the Southern
Conference, the win column, even the football field.
After 69 years, since 1896, Davidson’s footballers
deserve Terry’s four goals.

24 CONSECUTIVE CONVERSIONS |

By K. D. WEEKS
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Jim Terry, the “toe” of
the Wildcat's football team,
booted two conversions in
last week's victory over The
Citadel, to bring his three
year total to 24, all consecu-
tive, a new Southern con-
ference record.

“It's a fact — he’s the best’
(kicker) the conference ever
had. and he might be the best
in the country, we don't know,”
praised Coach Homer Smith.
“He is a very, very valuable
member of the team.”

Already this fail, the senior,
pre-med major. has kicked ten
point-afters and one field goal.
Not in his entire college career
has he missed a conversion at-
tempt. He has also been success-
ful on six of his twelve field
goal attempts.

After being hurt. as a half.
back in his sophomore year,

Terry decided to: kick full-time. .

Davidson’s no-longer surprising Wildcats methodically destroyed their third
straight opponent, The Citadel, by a 14-0 score last Saturday night in Charleston.

The game, which Coach Hom.
er Smith described as ‘‘the
sweetest’ victory thus far this
season, was a hotly contested
affair between a pair of well-
conditioned and expertly-coach-
ed teams. Unlike the past two
games, however, this one was
not decided until the waning
minutes.

The Cadets took the opening
kick-off and put the ball in play

on the 33, but soon found the
middle of the Davidson line the
wrong place to attack and were
forced to punt. The ‘Cats were
unable to move the ball: and
when The Citadel took over they
drove to the Davidson 21 in 14
plays. Pat Green's field goal at-
tempt from the 26 was short of
the mark.

moved to the 13 but were pushed

is.

Terry himself Js first to note,
however that “it takes twenty-
two other offensive and defen-
sive men to do the work before
I get a chance to kick. And this
year I have the best protection
I’ve ever had.”

When asked about the kick it-
self, Terry explains that he uses
a conventional style kick, with a
square-toe shoe. ‘I square away
With the tee and uprights, and
don't look up,’ he remarked,
“and this year the new two inch
tee helps me get height on the

bail.”

Coricerning the record he has
broken, Terry goes on to say,
“I didn't- know I was in sight of
the record until a. few days be-
fore the Citadel game, and I
didn't think about it in that
game until the announcer in-
formed the crowd of the new
record.”

here Wednesday to a strong
Wake Forest team 19-45 (low

weak Cadets of Citadel at Char-
leston, Jate this afternoon.

Wake Forest took the first
three places with Davidson's
captain Andy Little coming in
fourth and Jesse Sims running
fifth.

The Wildkittens fared Httle bet-
ter as the baby Deacons handed
them a 21.39 loss. Wake Forest's
Jim Sheffer ran the 2.1 mile
course in 10:41 minutes to set a
new course record, beating the
mark of 11:24 set by Jim West
of Myers Park last year.

Looking to today’s meet with

week, ‘We're weak after losing
four of our first five runners by
graduation, but we have never
had much trouble with The Cit-
adel before, and I don’t think

though the score did not seem
to indicate it, “‘the boys showed
a lot of hustle. Any team which
comes back io score a touch-
down after being twenty points
down has got to be hustling. The
boys never gave up.”

Lack of experience played a
great part in the outcome of
the game, and the coaches feel
that the experience gained in
that game will do much to
strengthen the entire team. Ask-
ed if this experience will pro-
duce better results as the season
progresses, Coach Campbell
stated, “I think this was our
main weakness. and we'll play
better as we go along from now
on.”

From all indications, Carolina
Military Academy will prove to
be a challenge. to say the least.
Loaded with postgraduates,
many of whom are older than
some on the Davidson squad,
they will be tough to stop. Coach
Campbell related that C.M.A.
beat Hargrave, from whom last
year's squad barely eked out a
victory on a late goal-line stand.

Coach Campbell declined to
mention any standouts on the
team, as “each one has been
doing a good Job.” Spirit has;

are out to win this one.

Sigs Stay On

By STEVE BROWN
Davidsonian Sports Writer

This week's IMAC action saw
the defending flickerball cham-
pions, Kappa Sigma, forge ahead
of Homer Smith's Gurkhas by
extending their 1965 winning
streak to 4 games. The KA's
fell victim to the Sigs on Monday
by a 33-20 tally. Said Kappa Sig
Tommy Reams, ‘‘We're doing
all right to far, but we're look-
ing for some good games — es-
pecially from the ATO's, the
Betas, and the Phi Delts."

The SAE's went down to de-
feat twice this week — 7-6 to an
inspired Sigma Chi team Mon-
day and 18-15 to the ATO’s Wed-
nesday. Commenting on the lat-
ter game, SAE Barry Bishop

Geoff Birkhead attributed his

In another Wednesday game,

staved off a Pika attack going

came midway in the second half
when the Independents scored a

immediately afterward; the Pika
kick-off was returned to pay dirt
with the aid of a 30-yard pass
by David Jennings.

Hunter.
