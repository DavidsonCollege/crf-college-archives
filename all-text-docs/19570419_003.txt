students paying homage to a sport that dates its history
from some seven hundred years ago.

The overall Cat record is
three wins and six losses.
The won-lost column, how-

ever, doesn't tell the true story.

On Davidson’s ten all-weather courts, you may not] The team has played consistent-

find a future Gonzales or Trabert, but you'll find every
type of would-be athlete from the determined spastic
to the better-than-average player indulging in tennis
just for the fun of it.

It’s justly so that tennis should rate such pop-
ularity here in Wildcatland, for, although other
schools may boast such an avid interest in the
sport, not all other schools can boast of the rich
tennis heritage to which Davidsonians point.

REBUILDING

The past two years have been years of rebuilding
for the Wildcat netters, and 1958 may well be the year
the ’Cats come back. In his fold this year Coach Dick
McKee has five sophomores and two freshmen who
show potential of great things. Let’s run down the list.

Bob Huffaker . . . a Charlotte product . . . pos-
sesses as pretty strokes as any one on the team. .
could be potentially the number one player on the
squad . . . fundamentally sound game.

Dave Pearsall .. . Charlotte . . . steady, determined

ing the cage season .. . played number one some

Gamecocks 8 to 1

By BOBBY PAGE

Davidson College’s unpredic-
table tennis team secured re-
venge for an earlier loss by de-
feating South Carolina 8-1 on
the local courts Wednesday and
gained confidence for coming
matches with Duke, West Vir-
ginia and Washington and Lee.
They met MIlinois here this
afternoon.

Going into today’s scrap with

*|the Northern visitors, the Cats

had compiled a total of six
wins against four defeats. Two
of the defeats were to George
Washington with South Caro-
lina and The Citadel account-
ing for the other two.

BLUE DEVILS NEXT

Tomorrow brings the potent
Blue Devils from Durham for
their first meeting of the year.
The Wildcats will probably
have John Robinson, Bob Huf-
faker, Dave Pearsall, Tom Mc-
Cutchen, Dick Hodel, and Semi
Mintz swinging away in that
order.

The feature match in Wed-
nesday’s tilt saw Robinson dis-
pose of Carolina’s Sonny Gantt
in the number one singles, 6-1,
7-5. Gantt won a three set match
two weeks ago in Columbia.
Huffaker was forced to three
sets against Bill Burns in the
number two match, but came
through with the necessary
stamina to cinch the team vic-
tory. Mintz was most impres-
sive in his 6-0, 60 rout.

- BROOME INJURED

Currently the team is play-
ing without the aid of its
promising freshman flash,
Harry Broome, who suffered a
severe injury to his elbow late
last week. The doctor’s report
says that Broome will be out
of action for two weeks, putting
him back just in time for the
Southern Conference  tourna-
ment to be held here on May
2, 3, 4.

performance for the top eight
men so far this season. Gary

average match with 76. Sam
Sloan and Bucky Dennis are
tight behind him with averages
of 77 while George Scott and
Stuart Vaughn have 78. Sutt
Alexander with 79 and Johnny

the team.

In recent matches the
Cats swamped the Citedel
23-34% with Alexander,
Dennis, Payne, Sloan, and
Vaughn all taking three
points from their oppo
nents.

North Carolina, a team with
fourteen good golfers, present-
ed a different situation. In a
ten man match Carolina ran
away to a 42%-2% victory on
the university course. Heese-
man fired a 73 to grab low
man honors‘ for Davidson but

his play was overshadowed by | Wednesday:

a two under par 70 by Hender-
son of Carolina.

Duke also proved too
much for the Cats at Dur-
ham. Despite Heeseman
and Payne who both shot a
75 the Blue Devils won
27.9. Beason was low for
Duke with par 70.

Coach Scott currently has| Beta

in the number one slot. Scott, Independents
although not having the best|Kappa Sig .
overall average, is the most ex-

perienced and dependable in
match play. The rest of the
team is arranged according to
their individual scores.

Coach Scott feels that his
team is playing a better
brand of golf then at this
time last year. He accredits
this to the stiffer competi-
tion of this year’s schedule
and the better courses the
matches have been played
on.

Captain Scott was in agree-
ment. “Considering the sched-
ule,” he commented, “we'll have
a fair season. The team is as
good as it has been.in several
seasons and should be very good
next year. The rough schedule
is helping the boys’ golf.”

The West Virginia match will
be the next to the last match
before the Southern Conference
Tournament. The Cats will
meet Furman the preceding day
on the tournament course.
Coach Scott is confident that
his team will improve last
year's last place standing.

Davidson's baseballers took the field this afternoon

against the McCrary Eagles in an effort to snap a los-
ing streak that has now been extended to four games.
Tomorrow afternoon at 2 p.m., the Wildcats meet Mer-
cer in a return engagement of a match in Macon, Ga.,
during the holidays which saw the teams split a double-

Led by the pitching of Little
Howard, the Phi Delts beat the
Independents, ATO’s, and Sig

chunking the Sigma Chi’s to
wins over the Betas and Kappa

header. Both tilts are slated for the local diamond.

The ‘Cats, still reeling after
the recent blitzkrieg have been
drilling strenuously all week.
The losing streak started last
Thursday when they bowed,
9-5 to The Citadel despite an
eighth inning rally which net-
ted the locals four runs on four
Citadel errors.

Don Killian fed the Da-
vidson batting in the con-
test with two singles in four
trips to the plete. Bill
Leonard, Bulldog catcher,
paced the home team’s at-

tallies in the second and ninth
innings. Joe Cooper, June
Raines, and all-conference third
baseman Bob Dellinger collect-
ed two hits apiece for the Hor-
nets.

Rightfielder Jim West con-
tinues to pace the Wildcat hit-
ting attack,’ hovering around
the .460 mark. Shelbourne Wal-

Even though both the Pi

good and promise to give the
first five teams some trouble.

AGAINST WEST VIRGINIA

Perfect Record

By BRANTLEY BURNS
Coach Whittle’s trackmen will Iay a record of five
wins and no defeats on the line tomorrow when they
meet West Virginia here at 1:30. The Mountaineers will
be paced by their Southern Conference vaulting cham-
pion who won the championship last year with a jump

four appesrances.

After a weekend's rest, coach
Tom Stevens’ charges met a
scrapping Belmont Abbey team
Monday. Davidson was out-
hustled, in losing a 6-5 heart-
breaker.

An interesting and hope-
ful development took place
in the Belmont contest,
however. Freshman back-
stop Dee Green traded his
mitt and mask for a toe
plate and took on the
mound duties, turning in a
very crediteble perform-
ance. Coach Stevens voiced
the opinion that Green
could develop into a key
hurler, and would probably
see more starting action. 7

meets of the year for the West
Virginia team, Coach Whittle
knows very little about their
potential. However, judging
from their record of last year,
they should have a better than
average team. In addition to

the pole vault the Mountaineers

CATS FAVORED

The Cats are definitely fa-
vored, especially in light of
their victory over a highly tout-
ed Clemson team on last Fri-
day. In that contest although
Clemson took 8 firsts to the
Cats’ 7, Davidson showed its
depth in taking more seconds

will also be strong in the
(9-4).

For the eighth consecutive
year the meet with Clemson
hinged on the results of the
mile relay. Mallory, Thurman,
MacKay and Asheraft turned in
an excellent performance to win
easily,

Particularly impressing in
these last five meets has been
the running of Mel. Armstrong.
The lanky speedster turned in
a 10.0 100 yd. dash and a 22.3
220 yd. dash to take first
places at Clemson. His running
this year has been one of the
most pleasant surprises for
Coach Whittle who at the first
' of the year, was bemoaning the
absence of Phil Koonce.

DISTANCE MAN
Pete Ashcraft,

in both the 880 and the mile.
Also, he anchored the winning
relay team which was hampered
somewhat by the absence of Al
‘Elder. Elder should be able to
run again in about two weeks
and will give the team an added
boost.

The trackmen showed sur-
prising strength in _ beating
Clemson who will probably
place third in the A.C.C. It
might well be that the Cats
could go undefeated this year.
