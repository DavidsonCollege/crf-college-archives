PHI SOCIETY.

Should the U. S. Adopt a National

Budget System? Eu’s and Phi's
.differ on this vital question.

The debate in the Phi Society,
‘while not exactly equal to that of a
, week ago, was “nevertheless pretty
‘lively with Poteat starring for the
affirmative and Dave Roberts for
ithe negative.

The usual preliminaries being dis-
posed of, J. W. Baldwin was the
first speaker for the affirmative de-
¢ biting the query: “Resolved, that
$ the United States Government
should adopt a national budget Sys-
tem.” He defined the budget and
showed specific instances proving
that the present syatem was in-
adequate and waste J. R. Jones,
the first speaker for the negative
showed that the present system was
good enough and that it was im-
proving. John Poteat, second for
the affirmative, explained the three
types of? budgets very fully. His
speech presented a very comprehen-
sive view of the budget system and
conclusive proof that it should be
acopted in one of the three forms.
Dave Roberts made a strong de-
fense of the present system and
showed that this system was not
wasteful as was commonly sup-
posed. L.A. Taylor showed that
since private corporations used this
system satisfactorily the govern-
ment could also adopt it with a
saving in running expenses. T. A.
Freeman, the last speaker for the
negative brought out the points that
money matters are better discussed
by a legislative body than by a bud-
get, and that the fianances are bet-
ter under the present system than
they would be under a budget sys-
On the rebuttals each speaker
came back strong in defence of his
attacked points. The decision was
twe in favor of the negative,

Ht. K. Russel declaimed, taking
parts of Wilson's speeches in Fu-
rope bearing directly on the League

: of Nations.

“Secretary” Lacy on the affirma-
tive and “Bugs” Robinson on the
negative undertook to argue the
query, “Resolved, that there should
»¢ women sheriffs.” This was un-
familiar ground for both debaters.
mt “Bugs” won the decision by one!
vote.

W. G. Johnston was received as a

o the Junior division.

The president stated the query,
and conditions for the Junior-Senior
Dehate, and the date as October 19.

After some discussion on the
possibilities of heat in the Hall this

jadjourned to meet again October
23, instead of October 16.

EU SOCIETY.

The meeting of the Eu Society
was one of the snappiest and most
enjoyable of any held this fall. The
special features of the evening were
|W. W. Moore’s oration and W. A.
Gamble’s declamation.

Devotional exercises were con-
ducted by the president and Rob.
| Mclnwaine, The debate, resolved.
That the United States should
adopt a national budget system was

excellent. The affirmative was up-
theld by J. R. Boulware and H. B.
| Heizer. The negative by A. D. King

and J.C. B. McLaughlin. The main
‘argument of the affirmative was,
that the present system is faulty
jand that the budget system is the
only one that can take its place. The
eee endeavored to prove that
the budget system is unconstitu-
tional and that it would place too
much power in the hands of one
man.

Next on the program was W. W.
Moore, who rendered an excellent
oration on the “Advantages of a
small college.’ ” So convincing were
Moore’s arguments that some were
almost persuaded to enter colleges
smaller than Davidson.

Following “W. W.’s” spellbinder,
W. A. Gamble delivered a declama-
tion which almost moved the au-
dience to tears. The subject of this

member of the society and assigned |

winter by J. M. Gaston, the society!

t

heart wringer was Victor Hugo’s
“Defense of His Son.” The speech
was well delivered and called forth:
much applause.

On account of the football game
in Charlotte next Saturday, it was
decided by a unanimous vote not to}
hold a meeting of the society Satur-_
day night.

DR. E. A. BYERS BEGINS WORK
AT DAVIDSON.
Capable Instructor Takes up Work
in Department of Modern
Languages.

The coming of Dr. E. A. Baers to
Davidson College as an additional
Professor in the Department. of
Modern Languages is evidence of
the material growth of this institu-
tion, and of its desire to regulate the
courses offered to conform to the

needs of the educated business man:

of today.

Dr. Byers was born in Liegnitz.
Germany, oof 9 German-American
parents, but at an carly age he re-
turned with them to this country.
A darge part of his boyhood was
spent in Atchison, Kansas, and it
was there that he received both his

preparatory and college training, at-.

tending Midland Academy and Col-
lege.
Upon graduation from Midland

College, Dr. Ivers entered the Wes-_
tern Theological Seminary, and re-:

ceived the degree of B.D.. from that
institution. The next two vears.
1912-13, were spent_in travelling
through the various European coun-
tries, a part of the time being spent
studying at. the Universities of Ber-
lin and Strasshourg.

From 1914 to 1917 he
head of the Department of Modern
Languages as his alma mater, Mid-
land College. Then, having spent
the summers studying at the Uni-
versities of Chicago and Nebraska,
he received his M.A. degree from the
last-named university in 1917.

That same year
Nebraska University as assistant in
Modern Languages, also” with a
view to completing his work for the
Ph.D. degree, which he received last
year.

During last summer Dr. Byers
was called to take charge of the!
teaching of Philosophy at Colorado:
University, and then to his present:
position at Davidson College. In the
short time that he has been here he
has won the respect and admiration
of all who have come in contact

he returned to’

was the.

with him, and we predict for him a
ereat success in his work here at
Davidson.
