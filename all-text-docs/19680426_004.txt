Norwood’s Airport Maintenance
Revs Up For Flying Instruction

By DAVID WEEMS
Photography Editor

Sophomore Tommy Nor-

wood has a different idea of
“flying”

what the term

gy

means than most students

do.

Rather than pumping away
in the: librdry, fe thinks of

pumping gas into airplanes.

nihg a small airport's flying
service?

Norwood does just that and
has been since October.

“I've been working at
Brockenbrough Airport near
Huntersville in an attempt to
pay for flying lessons,’ he
said. ‘‘In return for an after-
noon’s work, I receive an
hour of flying time. and also
.in the course of my work I
learn a lot about airplanes
and flying in general.

“My job includes just
about everything imaginable,
from changing the oil on the
planes, pumping up the wheel
struts, gassing planes that
come in in transit, taxiing
the plahes into the hangar at
night, taking care of the of-
fice. mopping the floors, and
anything else that needs 'be-
ing done."

work paid off when he was

first time.

structor asked him if‘he felt

Alcohol Regulations

- coed, there is less drinking

Last of a Series
By BOB REID
Associate Editor

While Davidson ponders its
policy on drinking. some
Southern schools have al
ready modified their stand on
the use of. alcohol.

Several liberal -arts col
leges, ‘including Washington
and Lee University. Univer.
-sity of the South and South.
western at Memphis, hare
either. liberalized their starids
‘or have them under consid.
eration.

“Our alcohol regulations
have been under considera.
tion. by a subcommittee since
Febuary.” said Charle’s
Diehl, dean of men. at South
western-at- Memphis. ‘“‘They
have come up with some.
changes, although I am not
entirely familiar with the
specific proposals.”

“The proposals will be sub’
mitted to the full committee
and then the faculty soon.
Diehl said. ‘I think it’s fair
to. say that our policy wil
not -be what it is this year.”

Sotthwestern’'s present
rules state that alcohol is not
permitted in the dormitories,
fraternities and sororities. or
anywhere else on campus.
Students may not be served
alcoholic beverages at col-
lege or Greek functions. al
though students may brown-
bag at parties.

Students caught in viola.
tion of these rules are gen.
erally placed on probation:
Diehl said.

At Washington and Lez
University, drinking is not
rermitted on campus. Put,
according to the rules. fra
ternity houses and many off-
campus residences are not
covered by the drinking reg-
ulation.

Most drinkins, at W&L
takes place in the fraternity
houses and is therefore legal
under the college's rules. Ac-
cording to officials in the
Office of the Dean of Men,
there is little drinking in the
dormitories and punishment
for the violation is light.

W&L, like other schools in
the area, leaves enforcement
of drinking rules to civil au-
thorities.

“Our position is that of the
law,’’ said John Webb, dean
of men at the University of
the South. ‘We are in a dry
county in a local option

‘étate, Thése students over 21
can buy and possess beer.
Everything else is, illegal.’

But the administration at
Sewanee seems to care little
about enforcing the Tennes-
see liquor law. “‘Students can
drink in their fraternity
houses."’ Webb said. * But we
seldom go in there and check
people's birth certificates.’

Damage. has been. a prob-
fem at Sewanee. Webb said.
ahd much of it can be traced
to drinking, We have a teg
ulation against drinking in
the dorms. But {'m sure it is
highty abused. There.is a
good deal of damage. and
sometime there is consider-
able damage. If it happens
in the fraternity houses. we

Violations are processed
through student courts. he
said. But at Sewaree, as at
Southwestern. W&L and
Duke, drinking is not an
honor violation. -

“Putting drinking under the
Honor System is like putting

. things like walking on the

grass under it.’ Wehb said.
’ The ideal solution is that a
college man ought to be ma.
ture enough to drink without
getting drunk.”

Ur..il this year, Duke main.
tained two-sets of rules on
drinking. one for men and
another for women. Now, co-
eds too can drink in their
dorms and quadrangle are-
as. Classes, cafeterias, hail-
ways. and vutdoor areas are
the only dry spots.

But according to a senior

in women's dorms now than
before the rule was changed.
“People on East Campus
(Coed) don't drink that much
anymore.’ said Saily Foot.
“When I first came here
there were about 10 or so
girls on every floof who
drank illegally, Now it’s ac-
cepted, and I think the
amount has decreased, too.
All the fears about damage .
and alcoholism were in vain.”

‘People around here are
worrying about more impor-
tani. things. than" a petty
drinking rule.’ she said.

him. and that if I got into
trouble up there that I had
four hours of fuel to use in
getting it down.

“I took it around the field
and made a rather poor land-

ing. but it was back on the |

ground. When I was rolling
to a stop, I realized what I
had done. I didn't think
about being by myself when
I was up in the air."

Norwood has been inter-
ested in flying since he can
remember, but until he final-
ly quit playing football this
fall, he had not had the
chance to take lessons. He
was told about the chance to
work at Brockenbrough by
Dr. S. D. Maloney, who had
been trying for some time to
form a student flying club.
In the process of his work
there. he feels, he has learn.
ed more about flying than
most people would just tak.
ing lessons. °

‘I've learned more. about
the function of airplanes by
working with them. Also I've.
listened to the different pil-
ots talk about their experi-

ences in the air.”

Not all that he has learned,
however, has been of this us-
ual type. ‘I've seen a lot of
bad habits formed by other
pilots, habits which I don't
intend to put into my own
repertoire.

“A lot of people are just
not that safety-conscious, and
by watching their mistakes
I have learned the reasons
behind the air safety rules.
We've had no real accidents,
but we've come real close a
couple of times."

Philosophy Major Plans
West Point Education

By JULE YOUNG of
Staff Writer

Richard Martin. a husky.
soft-spoken senior: philosophy
major, will enter West Point
next year as a freshman.

He will embark on another
four years of undergraduate
education, beginning with a
plebe year, and will follow it
with at least five years of
service in the Army.

He will pass‘up an ROTC
commission when he receives
his degree in June.

In taking ROTC. Martin

-was impressed’ with the or.

der and discipline of the
Army. An able student of
philosophy, he feels that a
military career is not,. op.
posed to his intellectual in.
‘terests. ‘

“It don't feel that a mili-
tary career is inconsistent
with the spirit of philos-
ophy.’’ he commented. ‘‘Phi-
losophers need disciplines.
Without it. they are unable
to develop their talent to the
fullest.

“Sure, some people don't

like regimentation. but there

Martin does not fit the
mold of the typical career
military man. Quiet, urbane
and sensitive. he gives ‘the
impression that he has care-
fully weighed the possibili-
ties that confront him.

“The military life is an in-
creasingly important element
within the framework of so
ciety, one which tends ¢o af
fect all of us,"’ Martin says.

Frye, a literary critic and
author, said that the earliest
mythology was that of the
mother-goddess, who created
the world in a sexual man-
ner. He added. that the moth.

tianity, the medieval myths?
had been that only devils
could be found in nature, but
nature was to be regarded as
evidence of God. Frye said.

“Poetry in each of these
periods reflected the myths
of the age.” Frye said, “but

in the Romantic period the ‘

poets tried to’ link. man’s
spiritual
through nature,"’-

Frye said that metaphor

and simile had been devel-

and secular lives -

oped to perform this correla-
tive function. ‘‘Man’s partici-
pation in nature was no long-
er subject-object but is a
part of nature’s organic proc-
ess,"* he said.

Frye also pointed out other
characteristics of the Ro-
mantic period, including re-.
vival of seeing nature as a
sdurce of gods and being
sympathetic toward disinher-
ited brothers. such as Cain.
Ishmael or Esau.

Frve also mentioned that
during the medieval period
the universe was divided in.
to four levels, The highest
Was the city of God, based on
St. Augustine's work. The
second level was the Garden
of Eden, which Frye com-
pared to a suburb of the city
of God.

“The inhabitants of the
Garden of Eden are like any

other inhabitants of subur-,
