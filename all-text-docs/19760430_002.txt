Faculty Article 12 vote

Motion removes the content

By MATTHEW COVINGTON
Editor

Article 12 of the proposed
College Constitution, that sec-
tion dealing with student
‘tights and responsibilities, has
been returned to a Governance
subcommittee to be reviewed
and re-worked.

The faculty in their meeting
on Tuesday voted in favor of a
resolution concerning the doc-
ument. The resolution read:
Motion: That the faculty ap-
prove in principle the proposed
Statement of Rights and Res-
ponsibilities, and ask the ori-
ginal subcommittee [on the
Statement] te review it and
remove any contentious lan-
guage with special attention to
section 2[b].

The motion was read by
Professor of German Hansford
M. Epes and received support
from the faculty by a vote of
36 to 32.

Epes’ motion was offered in
place of an expected fagulty
motion disapproving of Article
12. This motion was to have
originated with faculty com-
mittee appointed to review the
document headed by Professor
of English J. Gill’Holland.

Holland was pleased with
the passage of Epes’ substi-
tute motion and said that he
believed additional discussion
of faculty and students con-
cerning Article 12 would be
beneficial.

“Given the high intellectual
capabilities of the students, it
stands to reason that the more
discussion we have from them,
the better the document will
finally be,’’ said Holland.

Epes sees the faculty vote to
allow more work by the
Governance subcommittee as
a positive sign.

‘‘We received a positive
vote. The faculty, was saying
in effect, ‘yeah, we/will accept
a statement of student rights
and responsibilities.’ There
was some question in my mind
that this would happen, The
motion only passed by a slim
margin but it passed and I am
glad,’’ said Epes.

Some of the problems that
the faculty saw in the state-
ment as it apeared to them
Tuesday were the unclarity of

the document, the ‘‘legalese”

wording, and perhaps most
importantly, the apparent
adversary relationship it set
up between students and pro-

fessors.

Epes’ motion supports the
view by the faculty that the
statement needs to be re-
viewed. In Epes’ own words,
“Some of the document is just
flat bad as is so often the case
when a committee writes a
document. It is rarely great
prose.”

SGA President Bo Baskin
explained that an opportunity
to review the Statement of
Rights and Responsibilities
was better than the alternative
of having no document to
work with.

‘We avoided the possibility
of completely losing out with
the document. If the faculty
had voted it down, as I
believed they were prepared to
do, it,would have been no
good,” said Baskin.

~~ “There are a couple of places
_the faculty doesn’t like in the

document. If these places are
contentious we ought to get
them out of there. ‘I'he docu-
ment isn’t intended to be
antagonistic and I don’t want
to live with a document when
some members of the commu-
nity think it is kind of nasty,”
said Baskin.

Baskin, who has worked on
the present document heavily
since becoming SGA Presi-
dent in January, expressed
some unhappiness at having
another delay with the docu-
ment that has been in some
stage of re-write since the
spring of 1975.

“I wish there wasn’t going
to be another delay, but I
think the Trustees will be able
to pass the Statement on
principle when they meet in
May,” said Baskin.

‘Baskin also expressed a
feeling that some good had

come from his efforts to dis-
cuss the document with the
faculty before the Tuesday
meeting.

“It was the first time I had
taken to actually sit down and
talk with some of the faculty
members. I talked to more in
this one week than I probably
have in the four months I’ve
been SGA president. I think
the experience was beneficial
not only because some of the
faculty members understand
our feelings about the State-
ment, but also because it gave
us a chance to talk,’’ said
Baskin.

“T believe that students and
faculty should begin to work
together on a wide range of
things. I think we may have
laid some of the groundword
for this situation in our dis-
cussions on the Statement of
Student Rights and Responsi-
bilities ,’’ continued Baskin.

Dean of Students Will H.
Terry expressed a feeling
similar to Baskin’s. In refe-
rence to student-faculty rela-
tions, he said, ‘‘The process of
re-working the document can
help us know how .we feel

_ about things.’

‘Terry referred a nuit isee of
times to the ‘‘trust factor’’
involved in student-faculty
relations. He believes the
“trust factor’’ has been under-
cut by the Statement of
Rights and Responsibilities.

“The document seemed to
many as if it were spelling out
in detail ways in which stu-
dents were to be protected
from the institution. There
was also the feeling that the
document would be tested by
students once it was put into
effect so that they could see if
it was true. This undercut the
trust factor,’’ said Terry.

Terry believes that the
motion to study the document
again is a good one. He
suggested that the feeling in
the faculty meeting on Tues-
day was one of sensitivity.

“I believe the motion passed.
on ‘Tuesday was an affirmation
of faculty and student desire
to deal with this problem
honestly and forthrightly and
to resolve it,’’ concluded

Terry.
