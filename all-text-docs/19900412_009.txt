Review / Theater

Hedda Gabler

Spellbounds Audience.

By HEATH HARDAGE

Aneerie sense of foreboding anda
palpable sense of tension filled the set
of Hedda Gabler, the Davidson Col-
lege Theatre Department’s Spring
Production. On the nights of April 3
through April 7, theater goers were
held spellbound by the two-and-a-half
hour play performed in Hodson Hall.
Director Ai>x Pinkston created a me-
ticulously crafted presentation which
consistently held the attention of the
viewers. Se :

Henrik Ibsen’s. classic play. .o!
deceit and revenge focuses on the aris-
tocratic Hedda Gabler Tesman (Sarah
Robinson), who has justretumed from
her wedding trip. She is now the wife

of the well-meaning but bumbling .

George Tesman (Buck Reese), holder
of the scholarship for research in the
History of Civilization.

Hedda, once a belle and social
leader, has apparently married Tes-
man because she had hoped that George
would “be famous someday” for his
academic prowess. Although George
seems to be deeply in love with his
young wife, the marnag¢ is.a loveless
one on Hedda’s part.

.., Heddaisacold-hearted manipula-
tor whose character is very similar to
the Marquise de Merteuil in Christo-
pher Hampton’s play, Dangerous Lia-
sions. (Stephen Frear’s film of the
same name with Glenn Close as the
Marquise may illustrate amore recog-
nizable parallel.) She lives in aperpet-

ual state of boredom, which can only
be relieved by playing with other
people’s lives in a generally destruc-
tive manner.

When Hedda’s former “comrade”
and “intimate friend”, Ejlert Lovborg,
(Chuck Scofield), re-enters her sphere,
Hedda’snew married life is calledinto
question. She is obviously not happy,
and Lovborg also is dissatisfied with
his formermuse, Thea Elvsted, (Alyssa
Kendall).

Scandal, Hedda’s worst fear, looms
large when she is implicated in the
murder/suicide of Lovborg by Judge
Brack, (Brian Kosanovich). The Judge
knows ofherinvolvementin the affair,
buthe insinuates that all will be well if
he is allowed to take certain liberties
with Hedda. Hedda, who cannot bear

’ to be under the power of any man, kills
herself rather than be subject to the
whims of Brack.

The major players in this produc-
tion of Hedda Gabler were exception-
ally well-cast. Robinson was perfectly

cast as Hedda. She played her charac- —

ter with the delicious bitchiness inher-
entin Ibsen's anti-heroine. Hersarcas-
tic facial expressions and languid ges-
cynicism of Hedda.

Kendall played the part of Thea
beautifully: her fluttery voice and
nervous gestures were well-suited to
the part. Thea’s fearfulness and mis-
trust of the dangerous Hedda was well-

Student's Father Wins Date

By CURT BICKERS

Dr. George Flinn, a radiologist
from Memphis, Tennessee, is the fa-
ther of Davidson freshman Joanna
Flinn. He recently won a date with
Joan Rivers.

Flinn was performing amniocen-
tesis on a patient in his office while the
television was tuned to “The Joan
Rivers Show.” During the show Riv-
ers unveiled plans to “Get Joan a
Honey”. :

Dr. Flinn thoughtit would be funny
to enter, so he submitted an entry. He
sent a vial of red fluid with Joan’s
picture inside with an enclosed note
that said,”1’ve got Joan in my blood.”
The contest judges liked his entry, and
Dr. Flinn was invited to appear on
Rivers’ show ina “Dating Game” for-
mat, He was bachelor number three.
Flinn knew he had won when in re-
sponse to Joan’s greeting, he said,
“Hey, beautiful,’ whereas the other
two finalists only said, “Hello.” He
won, beating out 10,000 other contest-
ants in the nationwide contest.

Dr. Flinn and Ms. Rivers went on
a filmed mock date in which they were

chauffeured by ahuge, scary man driv- _

ing a Yugo. The twowere flashed, then

mugged while policeman’ stood”and ~~

watched. That evening, the two en-
joyed a real date along with the pro-
duction crew at a very nice restaurant
in New York City.

Ms. Rivers enjoyed Dr. Flinn so
much that she invited him and Joanna
to Los Angeles for aparty given by Ms.
Rivers and her daughter on the week-

Dr. Flinn has received nationwide
acclaim for this wacky contest. Ar-
ticles of him and “Ms. Rivers have
appeared in The Star, The Globe and
other tabloid-type magazines. He has

also been interviewed on several na-
tional morning news shows.

But how does Flinn react to all of
this publicity? He says he has had alot
of fun, but he just wants life to go back
to normal.

Davidson Students Visit Dominican

By PHILLIP PRESCOTT

____ During Spring Break senior DJ.
Snell and several other Davidson stu-
dents visited the Dominican Republic
to help build’ churches. The
Davidsonian interviewed Snell abo!
his experience.

Davidsonian: Who organized the
trip, and how was it planned?

Snell: In my hometown church, I
heard about achurch inthe Dominican
Republic that was trying to build an
orphanage. As I Jater found out, there
was not yet enough land on which to
build the orphanage. However, Mark
Johnson, a freshman at Davidson, and
his father discovered that a hospital in
the city needed a wall built. Every-
thing we needed was taken care of
except for our flight to the Dominican
Republic.

Davidsonian: How did you raise
the money to fly tothe Dominican Re-
public? -

Snell: First, we tried to get finan-
cial support from our local churches.
The cost of the trip for each individual
was $700. We also got corporate spon-
sors such as the Coca-Cola Company,
and we received $200 from Grace

Covenant Church

~- Davidsonian: Who went on the ~

trip?

Snell: There were eight Davidson
students and also a Wake Forest stu-
dent. We were led by the preacher
from Grace Covenant and his wife.

Davidsonian: What was your typi-
cal day like?

Snell: Well, first we were staying
at the Good News Camp. The guys
slept in a room with bunks, and the
girls slept in another room. We would
get up at 6 a.m.; and since the water
andelectricity wereunreliable, we were
lucky if we could take showers. We
would have an hour of quiet time and
then eat breakfast around 8 a.m. We
would work from about 9-12, take an.
hour break for lunch, and return to
work from 2 p.m. until 5 p.m. In the
evening, we would meet people from
the community, sometimes visit local
churches, and goto town foricecream.

Davidsonian: What kind of work
did you do?

Snell: Over the years, industry has

colony.

developed across the street from the
hospital because of a tax-free zone. A
hospital needs peace and quiet for its
patients so the wall we built was largely
for sound protection. We had a man
who was familiar with building super-
vise ourconstruction of the wall. When
he passed by a worker (and this be-
came a group joke), he would always
say mas mas-meaning he wanted more
cement. One day instead of working
on the wall we wentintoacommunity.
~We played games with the children,
told them Bible stories, and sang songs.
Probably our most dramatic memory
was going to a leper colony. We only
stayed about thirty minutes, and we
handed out candy to the lepers.

Davidsonian: Did the group learn
some Spanish before the trip?

Snell: We leamed a few songs n
Spanish before the trip but we didn’t
have much time because most people

the Spanish department, was really

Davidsonian: How have you been
changed by this experience?

Snell: Not to any great extent.
There have been a lot of objections to

missionaries, but! don’t think they are -

the turn of the century these criticisms

were true, but not now. I think we as
missionaries were more missionized
by the people we came to help.
