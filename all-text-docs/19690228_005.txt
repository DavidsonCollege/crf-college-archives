FROM THE

BENCH

ROCKY CRosswHine

Movies, Milk and Sleep

As we all know, it's tournament time again. Lefty
tells us this is when the fun begins. For me this is
the time when we play for the silver-plated trophies
and the Bulova watches. Especially this is the time
when the starters get mean and lean while the skins

get fat and happy.

For the players, the Southern Conference tourna-
ment begins when we leave school either Wednesday
afternoon or Thursday morning. Although the tourney
is played in Charlotte, we move in one of the three
motels surrounding the coliseum, taking with us the
good wishes of our fellow students twenty miles away.

The first important information we seek out after
arriving in Charlotte is who is to room together for
the long three days. Although this doesn't sound that
crucial, the tourney stay is much longer than our
usual road trips and congenial roommates are helpful.
Sooner or later during the season each player rooms
with everyone on the team but you hope for the best

at this time.

To illustrate the difference I will use Bob Pickens,
who played last year, as an example. Bob was a great
TV watcher on trips. He could name just about every
program that had been on since TV was invented and
Ed Sullivan appeared. He knew from memory thé stars
and co-stars of such weeklies as the old “Leave it to
Beaver” and “Mr. Lucky.” He even knew the horse
names in all the Westerns. It was hard for him to
room with a studious player when the first thing he
did when he walked into a motel room was to turn on

the TV.

Like Bob, Steve Kirley is a tube connoisseur.
Steve sticks mainly to old movies which come on at
odd hours in the morning and afternoon. He can just
about tell you what are the best and worst flicks to
watch on the early-early show, the early-late show;
or the late-early show. Being a walking TV movie
guide, he was in his element in New York where movies
play on TV until five in the morning.

1 imagine Doug Cook and Wayne Huckel are good
roommates because they sleep all the time. Whenever
you knock on their door to borrow some toothpaste
because you didn’t bring a tube or the maid threw it
away, either Wayne or Doug is snoozing. They wearily
open the door and give you what you want and then

hop back in bed.

A bridge game is usually in session in Duncan
Postma’s room. Duncan has probably read most of
Charles Goren’s works and never fails to expound on
his learnings. Mike Maloy and I occasionally sit in on
a game while Mike O’Neill drops in once in a while

to try his luck.

We eat very well on our road trips and especially
during the tourneys in Charlotte. The Barclay Cafe-
teria is just east on Independence Ave. and we eat
most of our meals there. Lefty will tell us to go there
and pass through ‘the food line making sure we don’t
buy any greasy foods. Also we’re not to have any

berry pie (Strawberry, Blueberry, Cherry, etc. .

.) or

milk. You see, Lefty says milk has colesterol in it and
we will all have heart-attacks or something if we
drink it. He hasn't explained why berry pie is bad
for us but I’m sure there’s a logical explanation. ‘

During the afternoons on Friday and Saturday
we usually go to a movie. Lefty approves of movies
for the players in that it’s a type of recreation that
doesn't take too much energy and also it keeps us
out of trouble for two or three hours. At Christmas,
we saw most of the flicks Charlotte had to offer.
O’Neill and Moser are avid movie-goers and I usually
talk to them before seeing anything.

After the last game in the tourney is played, we
usually go out and get something to eat. Occasionally
we meet some of our opponents in the same establish-
ment and being foreign to Charlotte, they always
ask ‘where the action is.” We kind of langh and ask
“what action?” We then tell them to see Kirley about

the TV movie schedule.

TO OVERCOME ‘KING BASKETBALL’
Folgeman Cites Role Of Soccer, Tennis

By CHARLIE TERRELL
Sports Writer
(First tn A Series)

Shortly the spring sports
schedule will be in full swing.
Many of Davidson's athletes
will be competing on the
baseball diamond, tennis
courts and cinder track—all
non-subsidized athletes.

In this first article con
cerning the so called ‘‘mi-
nor’ sport, problems facing
the tennis and soccer teams
will be examined in their re.
lationship to the overall suc-
cesses and shortcomings of
these two non-subsidized
sports.

Coach Harry Fogleman,
who directs the-squads, says
that the sports are not
minor. ‘‘The distinction should
be between subsidized and
non-subsidized sports, not
major or minor.” he said.

Minor sports or not, tennis
and soccer do not command
the public attention which is
focused on the basketball
and football teams. What can
be done to overcome this
problem. to bring them out
of the ominous shadow of
“King Basketball.’ is a dif.
ficult question.

Concerning the soccer
team. Fogleman named sev-
eral additions to the facili-
ties which would be tremen-
dous assets to the program.
‘When we moved the soccer
field some 25 yards to allow
the practice football field to
be built, I was promised a
new field, but we don't have
it yet.’ said Fogleman. He
added that seats for specta-

tors, a scoring table, and a

prove the facilities for soc-
cer.

There is apparently an in-
terest in Davidson soccer, as
evidenced by letters which
Fogleman has received in
the past two years from high
school coaches in the Atlanta,
Washington, D. C., and Phil.
adelphia areas. These let-
ters question him about
scholarships. In reply to
these, he must respond that
no athletic scholarships are
given to soccer players.

“How can the soccer pro
gram be successful if no
money can be offered to

prospective players?"’ Fogle.

man asked.

Fogleman answered this
question himself by saying
that his programs ‘can oper
ate without scholarships.
However, I feel that the col-
lege should realign its think-
ing about scholarships. It
soccer and tennis wefe to be
subsidized, then all other

sports should be.”

He compared a football
player who receives $2500 to
a tennis player who has to
pay $2500, and stressed a
point which is very relevant
to the subsidized athletic
problem: ‘Both players are
working hard, they have
made a team and are con
tributing to the ‘program. It
seems to me that the. one
who must pay should receive
something for his efforts, at
least meal-money.”’

The sport which concerns
Fogleman the most. is ten-
nis. He receives almost fifty
letters annually from high

school players inquiring
about scholarships. and must
answer them _ negatively.

Says Fogleman: ‘‘I feel that
our program has a lot to
offer a boy. We provide
equipment for him, and I
have no qualms about the
present budget. It is ade.
quate for the program.” If
the sport were subsidized,
he added, then the budget
would have to increase to

Cannon II, Delts,
Nus Capture Titles

By BILL BERRY

The championships of ‘both
freshman and fraternity in.

cided on Wednesday night as
Cannon 2 whipped East 2 for
the freshman title and the
Phi Delts won their game
against the Pikas to tie the
Sigma Nus for the title in
fraternity competition with
an 11.1 record. The Nus won
their last game on Tuesday
night and clinched a tie for
the championship, so the
Delts had to win to tie for the
title. ;

The Delt victory was prob
ably the most exciting game
of the season as the Delts
withstood a fourth quarter
Pika rally to win, 50A9.

The Delts pulled out to a
seven point lead in the first
quarter on the strength of
their rebouncing and some

fine shooting by Gene Early.
They maintained this lead
until the fourth quarter when
the Pikas began their rally.

While the Pika defense was
holding the Delts to only six
points in the, final quarter.
Brian Smith and Davis Liles
led: the offensive surge which
tied the score at. 49 all with
a minute to play. Garth
Hampton was able to convert
a free throw with 25 seconds
remaining for the final mar
gin of victory. The Pikas
tried to set up a final shot.
but the Delts intercepted a
pass to wrap up the win. The

loss left the Pikas in third,

place with a 9.3 record.
Early was high scorer for
the Delts with 16 points fol-
lowed by Ed Dobbs with 15.
Mark Affeldt had 16 for the
Pikes, Smith 14 and Liles 10.

Academic-Minded Strong
Talks Of Negro Problems

By DON PARMAN
Sports Writer

Unlike many athletes, it
was academics, not basket-
ball, that was the first con-
sideration which brought
freshman forward Lester
Strong to Davidson.

“I wanted a piace where
I would be accepted for my-
self, not as one of Lefty’s
boys,”* said Strong.

“I had a few apprehensions
as a Negro about coming
south to Davidson, but part
of a complete education is
being exposed to different
conditions. It helps you un-
derstand.

“I'm deeply concerned with

LESTER STRONG
. . « academic influence

the Negro problem, since re-
ally it's the hurran problem.
I think that through college
I can prepare myself so that
I can do more to change the
situation.”*

Although Strong said that
the small number of Negroes
enrolled at Davidson did not
worry him in making his
decision. he would caution
another Negro student about
certain circumstances in com-
ing to Davidson.

“You have to be willing
to contend with some tough
problems which effect not
only Negroes but all students.
If I didn’t have a car here
I would be lost. It’s bad
enough for a regular student
without a car here. but it’s
worse for a Negro.”

Strong starred at Braddock
High School in Pennsylvania
and received from 50 to 75
offers from various colleges
to play basketball.

“J was fairly happy with
the season that the fresh-
man team and I myself had
this year. I was actually an-
ticjpating a possible low-
scoring year since I had to
make the transition from cen-
ter in high school to forward
here,” Strong said.

This season Strong, who
often faced taller competition
and got into foul trouble.
averaged about 12 points per
contest and finished second
in team rebounds to Eric

Minkin.

of starting are slim with all

‘Mike Maloy and Jerry
Kroll, Davidson's two lead-
ing scorers, have been named
to the All-Southern Confer-
ence first team.

Doug Cook and Dave Moser
were chosen as second-team
All-Conference choices.

Maloy, the third highest
scorer in the league with a
24.2 average and the second
highest rebounder with a 14.7
average, was named as a
sophomore last year, while
Kroll, sixth in the conference
scoring with a 17.7 average,
was named for the first time.

Joining Maloy and Kroll on
the honor squad are George
Washington's Bob Tallent.
Furman’'s Dick Esleeck, and
Kenny Foster of Richmond.

Cook was also a_ second-
choice last year. This season
he has averaged 14 _ points
and nearly .10 rebounds a
game, while play-maker
Moser leads the conference
with 125 assists.

Other members of the sec-
ond team are the Citadel's
Tee Hooper, VMI's John Mit-
chell, and East Carolina's
Richard Keir.

Bryan Adrian finished the
freshman season with the
highest scoring average in
Davidson history.

The Brooklyn, N. Y. native.
possibly the best shooter to
ever play for a Wildcat team,
averaged 28.7 points a game
this year, hitting 49.6 per
cent of his shots from the
field.

Eric Minkin led the fresh-
men in rebounding by grab-
bing 14.4 rebounds a game.

ee

For the second time in the
past three weeks, Mike Ma-
loy has been chosen. as the
Southern Conference Player

and pulled down 37 rebounds.

Also, Maloy became the
seventh person in Wildcat
history to score over 1.000
points in his career.

A big selling point for the
tennis team is the schedule.
Twenty-five matches are

to schedule large Eastern
and Mid Western — schools.
Another luerative aspect of
the program is a trip. usual-
ly to Florida, during spring
vacation. “‘We play some
competitive matches, but we
generally let the boys have a
good time.”

Fogleman pointed out that
‘we have excellent facilities

he said. referring to David-
son's overall athletic pro
gram.

When asked what he felt
were the weaknesses of. our
athletic program, Fogleman
was quick to reply that ‘‘the
non-subsidized sports are not
given adequate publicity.”
Though the football and bas.
ketball programs receive
favorable publicity, the other
sports are given very little
notice or none at all by area
newspapers.

Fogleman produced a ‘ring
binder’ containing clippings
of the soccer games for the
past season. This “coverage”
amounted to three minute
rectangular articles giving
the results of only three
games. ‘‘I don't know whose
fault it is, but something
should be done to publicize
our non-subsidized sports."

After all. the “D°’ earned

out, ‘‘The fellow who pays
the $2500 would like to see

semi-final round tonight. the
Wildcats will face either
East Carolina or George

East Carolina is one of the
two conference schools that
Davidson didn't play this

top-ranked team with an un-
