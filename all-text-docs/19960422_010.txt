Movie Review
Fargo
goes the
distance

By Ep AcLE
Movie Critic

Let me state for the record
that I am not a die-hard Coen
Brothers fan. The Brothers, (Joel
is the director, Ethan the pro-
ducer) have made a number of
off-beat films that have gener-
ally met with great critical favor.
Films like Blood Simple, Raising
Arizona, and Miller’s Crossing
have cemented their reputation
as some of the rulers of the inde-
pendent film circuit.

I always found them a bit
too cold for my liking. Sure, I
admired the technical brilliance
and snappy dialogue of the films,
but I often felt like they were the
cinematic equivalent of the Tin
Man — bright and shiny on the
outside, but ultimately missing
the most important organ of all.

Then I saw Fargo. The lat-
est from the Brothers is not only

as funny and intelligent as some
of their other films, but it also has

aheart. The plot goes something
like this: Jerry Lundergaard needs
some cash — now. Since he has
a rich father-in-law who adores
his daughter but considers Jerry
pond scum, Jerry launches. a plot

serious dough. Jerry’s brightidea
is to have his wife kidnapped and
held for ransom while he collects
the money from his father-in-
law. The plot gets fairly tangled,
as do so many of the Brothers
films, but this one is fun to watch
unravel.

This time the Brothers have
created characters the audience
really cares about, whether it be
the inept Jerry, the strange kid-
nappers, or the idiot father-in-
law. Even though all of these
characters are despicable in their
own way, I couldn’ t help but feel
sorry for each of them at least
once during the film.

Unravelling the mystery is
the police chief, Marge
Gunderson (played brilliantly by
Frances McDormand, Joel
Coen’s wife). She is a compas-
sionate woman whose apparently
slow exterior (it is so hard to get
past the annoying Midwestern
accents!) masks the smartest
mind by far in the film. Franny
may seem harmless, but she is
one heckuva sheriff.

So come one, come all, to
the latest Coens Brother extrava-
ganza.. If you like smart camera
shots, witty dialogue, graphic
violence, and snow — lots of it
—then this film is for you. Ifyou
don’t like any of that stuff, go
anyway. You'll get the chance to
laugh at all of the ridiculous ac-
cents for weeks afterwards.

The Symphony performs an emotionally powerful selection of old and new pieces

This past Thursday, Davidson
College and Classical 89.9 WDAV
premiered our own Composer-in-
Residence Richard Prior’s Con-
certo for Piano and Orchestra:
Phoenix Rising, written for Pia-
nist-in-Residence James Swisher.
In addition to Prior’s concerto, the
Davidson College Symphony Or-
chestra performed Benjamin
Britten’s (1913-1976)Simple Sym-
phony and Mozart’s (1756-1791)
Overture to Marriage of Figaro.

The concert opened with the
operatic overture. In Mozart’s
Marriage of Figaro, the overture
serves to capture the humorous

tone and the impending crazed
mystique that pervades the opera.
The symphony achieved the comic
overtones through insightful inter-
pretation and articulation. With
exceptional poise and grace,
Eleanor Merrill, concert master,
assembled the talents of the string
section in the piece following,

Britten’s Simple Symphony. This

work is arranged ‘in a traditional
four movement presentation, but
with a fast second and a slower
third movement written in tradi-
tional dance forms. The distinc-
tive second movement utilized the
string technique pizzicato provid-
ing a lighthearted atmosphere.
Each movement, varying inrhythm
and character, contributed to the
work’s jovial and naive nature.

After a brief introduction by
Rachel Stewart from WDAV,
Prior’s piece was unveiled with a
slow introduction. In the introduc-
tion, the piano declares the open-
ing statement that is the develop-
ment of the rising gesture, the crux
of the piece. This prefacing sec-
tion advances into a relentless and
driving energy during which the
piano gradually builds increasingly
complex and virtuosic strands.

The second movement is cast
in a romantic vein, designed to
display the soloist and orchestra in
a specific interpretive mode. This
movement also concentrates upon
the rising motive that is heard in
numerous embodiments within the
orchestral texture. The third and
final movement is based upon

rhythm. This movement steadily
intensifies to a climax in which the
rising gesture reaches its final trans-
formation, the foundation of the
piece.

Prior musically encaptulated
the emotion enveloped within the
formitable bonds between com-
poser and soloist and composer
and orchestra. Reminiscent of the
Grieg Piano Concerto in A Minor,
also performed by James Swisher
in last year’s spring concert,
Swisher mesmerized the audience
through a momentous display of
true artistic ability, on part of both
the composer and the soloist.

The power of the performance -
overwhelmed the audience, who
left after a standing ovation speech-
less and simply astounded.

Dance troupe explores nature’s order

Last Tuesday evening, the
dance’ theater company Forces of
Nature performed in Love audito-
rium. The ensemble came to
Davidson as part of the Artists
Series presented by the College
Union. The group consists of 15
dancers and three musicians.
Forces of Nature uses characteris-
tics of traditional African and mod-
ern western dance to create a unique
style of their own. In their perfor-
mance they pay homage to the
spirits of their ancestors as well as
the spirits of animals. Many of
their dances involve symbolic im-
_ages of animals. According to the
leader of their troupe, Forces of

.Nature’s mission is to “create a

‘Living Book’ from which all ages

experience the talent, histories,
mythologies, and accomplishments
of the African Diaspora and its
influence in American Dance.”
One of the more interesting
dances that the troupe performed
was entitled “Night Predators.”
The description of this dance is
“By the law that grants me your
flesh that I may survive so will my
body be consumed by the order of
that same law.” This dance fea-
tured three scenes. Several danc-
ers depicted carnivorous animals
inthe first scene. The second scene
featured a herbivorous animal. The
third depicted the carnivores at-
tacking and killing the herbivore.
As the scene progressed, other car-
nivores came and devoured the
first carnivores. The dance came
to aconclusion as dancers dressed
as men threw nets over the fighting

carnivores.. In essence, the dance
mimicked the food chain. :
One of the dancers performed
a solo piece entitled “The Mud
Below.” This piece depicted a
reptile and various magical trans-

formations into two other crea-
tures. Set to music reminiscent of
a rain forest, the soloist portrayed
the transmutation of several primi-
