NUMBER 9

Soccer Nets Championship, NCAA Bid Expected

By Bruce Balestier

Two weeks ago in Greenville,
S.C., Davidson’s soccer players,
many of them in tears, watched as
Furman’s players whooped it up in
celebrating their conference regu-
lar-season title after a 3-2 win over
the ‘Cats. Sunday afternoon in
Greensboro, it was Davidson who
did the whooping after winning

the Southern Conference Tourna-
ment title with a 3-1 victory over
Appalachian State in the final.
For Davidson, the tournament
victory all but ensured that the
finest season in school history will
conclude with an all-important
appearance in the NCAA Tourna-
ment. Consecutive losses to Coastal
Carolina and Furman late in the

season had put a tournament bid in
jeopardy, and set up a clearcut ul-
timatum: win the final five games
of the season or else.

Sunday’s win over the Moun-
taineers was the final game in that
stretch, and the feeling among the
coaches and players was that a 16-
4-3 team witha win over #6 UCLA
and ties with #1 N.C. State and #2

Duke does indeed deserve a bid.
The 28-team tournament field was
announced this afternoon by the
NCAA. “The kids have really re-
sponded all year,” coach Charlie
Slagle said. “They’ ve earned what
they’ ve done and it’s been great. I
think we deserve a bid.”

Senior defender Craig Omli
saw the tournament invitation as a

Last Year

By Mandy Curtis

The number of applicants for
admission at Davidson is up sixty
from last year at this time. As of
November 5, the admissions of-
fice has received a total of 1093
applications as opposed to the 1033
in by the same date last year. Of
the total, 270 of the applicants are

last year’s total number of early
decision candidates which was 265.

Of the early decision appli-

cants;"exactly half;-135;-are-*men ~

and half are women. The admis-
sions office will be anticipating
more as the deadline of November
20 gets closer. Dean of Admis-.
sions Nancy Cable Wells reported
that Admissions is still expecting
“a big flurry of them.”

413 of the freshman regular
applicants are females while 388
are males. Wells said, “We are
opening more of them [Part I of the

application] as we speak.”

Davidson
Establishes
Morehouse
Exchange
Program

By Rachel Dunifon

Two weeks ago Davidson en-
tered into an historic agreement
with Morehouse College, estab-
lishing a student exchange pro-
gram with the all-male, predomi-
nantly black school located in At-
lanta. Both schools hope that their
students will benefit from this
unique opportunity to live and
study in drastically different envi-

ronments Wan er own.
According to Assistant Dean
of Students John Eaves, concrete
efforts to establish a permanent
exchange program between the two
schools began last year. Eaves, an
*84 graduate of Morehouse, used
his contacts with his alma mater to

.| determine whether the school

would be interested in considering
an exchange program with
Davidson. After finding the

Associate Dean of Admis-
sions, Bob Douthit, referred to Part
I as “the easy part.” The second
part of the application for regular

_applicants is due in by February 1.

Because Davidson does not
admit on a rolling basis, the appli-
cations have not been read as of
yet. The office is continuing to
receive mail, to organize files, and
to put information into the com-
puter. Wells remarked that “the
numbers look strong,” but until the
applications are read, there is “no
indication of quality.”

- ‘We'll wait tothe 16th or 17th
[of November] to begin reading
the early applications,” stated
Wells. The admissions counselors
will be reading the applications in
conjunction with the Faculty Ad-
missions Committee chaired by
Bill Mahoney.

The application season or ‘92
and ‘93 will be the first for Wells,
who took over the reigns from last
year’s Interim Dean of Admissions,
Homer Sutton. Douthit said that
Sutton ‘did “a wonderful job for
us.”. “We are staying steady with
last year’s Criteria,” said Wells.

According to Wells, the ad-
missions office will be “paying

Historian LaFeber Discusses the
U.S and the "New World Order”

By Meg Davis.

‘While Bill Clinton won the
Presidential election on Tuesday
night, historians gathered to listen
to Dr. Walter LaFeber discuss the
changing world order, a subject
directly related to Clinton’s im-
pending presidency. Ina presenta-
tion entitled, “The United States
and the New World Order,”
LaFeber addressed the shifts in
power occurring in the post- Cold
War world and posed the question,

“What will replace. . . the only
world we know?”

Specializing in American dip-
lomatic history, LaFeber is the
Marie Underhill Noll Professor of
History at Cornell University. His
works include fifteen books on U.S.

-foreign relations. His accolades

include Cornell University’s first
John M. Clark award for under-
graduate teaching.

LaFeber attended Hanover
College in Indiana, received his
masters from Stanford University,
and his Ph.D. from the University

of Wisconsin at Madison. Healso

expressed excitement about his .

opportunity to speak with
Davidson’s Dr. Ralph Levering,
who also specializes in United
States diplomatic history.

LaFeber began his discussion
of the “new world order” with an
explanation of the origins of this
phrase first used publicly by Presi-
dent George Bush in his 1991 State
of the Union address. LaFeber
‘quoted Bush as saying, “A new
world order of peace and security,
of freedom and the rule of law will
reign.”

The phrase first came to the
attention of the press in the context
of the Bush administration’s reac-
tion to Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait.
According to LaFeber, the irony of
the “new world order” is that itwas
never defined by Bush, nor did a
definition by Bush or Clinton
emerge from the recent presiden-
tial campaign since the focus rested
on domestic issues.

LaFeber feels technology has

playedasignificantpartin the defi-
nition of this new world order.
Technology is leading to a “decen-
tralization and fragmentation” of
power, according to LaFeber.
“What is most striking about [tech-
nology] is not only the ending of
the... two-camp world in the Cold
War, but we’ve also seen. . . the
diffusion of the ability of many
other nations to use this technol-
ogy militarily and for civilian uses

Morehouse representatives to. be
receptive to the idea, Eaves, along
with the Registrar, Financial Aid,
and Dean of Admissions offices,
drafted a proposal which was sent
to Morehouse and was recently
accepted.

As stated in the proposal, the
exchange program exists to “es-
tablish a plan whereby students at
Morehouse College or Davidson
College can matriculate on an ex-
change basis at an institution that
is culturally and racially different
than their home institution.” More

‘specifically, the experiences that

Davidson hopes for this program
to provide for its students include:

munity with a significant African-
