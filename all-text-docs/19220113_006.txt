DR. HOOD’S BIBLE CLASS
LESSON GIVEN IN OUTLINE

Read I Kings 18:1-46,
Elijah’s Challenge.

1. First challenge was to the people
that they make test of their profession.
“If the. Lord. be God, follow him; but if
Baal, then follow him.” In other words,
|@ man’s religion ought to be deep enough
|to instigate action. We too often ac-
| quiesce in a religious plan or a religious
|dogma, but how many of us take it
seriously enough to make us act on our
professed principles. This then is
Elijah’s first challenge: If you have any
religion at all, show it by following; by
actually acting upon your belief.

“And the people answered him not a

2. The second challenge was to pro-
duce evidence sufficiently strong for an
intellectual decision as to who is God—
Jehovah or Baal.

The first challenge was too high. The
second was pitcheéd on a lower plane, on

Things done, that took the eye and had
the price

|Found straightway to its mind, could

value in a trice.”

It seems to me a sad commentary upon
the spiritual condition of Israel that only
such a test as Elijah proposed would be
acceptable. But the prophet shows his
skill in selecting a test, crude as it was,
was yet the only one that would arouse
the people,

3. Elijah’s success is to be attributable |
to the same power that has always won |
moral victory—faith in God. His faith
in God is shown (1) by his very courage
in making the challenge; (2) by the un-
certainly exhibited that his
would be answered,

4. Effect upon the people. ‘It aroused |
them to verbal action, but as we shall!
see subsequently, the success of the chal-
lenge, judged by the permanency of the
effects, was doubtful. Low motives may
sometimes get action when high ones
fail, but unless the higher are finally
acted on the action aroused is not worth
anything

I-very man come with some personally
derived lesson from the study of this
passage.

MISSION STUDY COURSE PUT
ON BY “Y” FOR NINE’ WEEKS

In its mission study course this spring,
the Y. M. C. A. plans to study our own
church’s work on the foreign field, using
our own publications as text-books. The
course will cover nine weeks, the first
six being studies of our various fields,
and the last three being surveys of our
education, medical and industrial work.

Classes will be held on the various
floors every Wednesday night, as usual,
but the leader’s class will be taught by
students this year instead of faculty
leaders, These leaders will be J. C.
Wool, on China; D. H. Ogden, on Korea;
J. H. McKeithen, on Japan; P. D. Miller,
on Brazil; V. C. Haye, on Mexico; Ed.
Cunningham, on Medical Missions, and
Jas. Sprunt, on Educational Missions.

The Students will be glad to note that
the money to pay for the literature has
been secured from the Y. M. C. A. and
otheg sources, so that the pamphlets
used will be given out without charge to
the students,

The course is designed to give the or-
dinary layman’s Working knowledge of
what our church is doing on the foreign
field, and should be of great interest to
all.
