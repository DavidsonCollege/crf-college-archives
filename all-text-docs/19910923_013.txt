dent. If the bicycle is registered, a search can be started using the police
information network and Crime Stoppers. A crime report is also sent to
the local police stations.

Using these techniques, the police were able to recover 60 percent of
the total items stolen from campus last year, so Thrower states that the
system really can work.

The Campus Police make a ached effort to watch the bicycle racks
on their rounds, but both Thrower and Chief of Campus Police Sergeant
Rick Moore feel that student participation is crucial tocrime prevention.

“If students watched the bike racks as well and reported anyone who
was acting suspiciously or who looked as if he or she didn’t belong, we
would have far fewer bikes being stolen,” says Thrower.

This crime can occur at any time, in any place. Thrower gives the
example of one bike that was stolen at 11:15am. Itsowner hadrun inside

the Union for a 15 minute break. This gave a thief ample time to hop on .

the unlocked bike and ride away.

Thrower feels that an integral part of the job of Campus Police is to
make students aware of these incidents-- and to let them know that
crimes like bicycle theft can be prevented.

To help prevent bike theft, Thrower is considering a new policy of
bicycle registration for next year. When students come to register their
bikes, they would be required to own the horseshoe lock. If they did not
possess one of these locks, they would pay aregistration fee covering the
cost of a lock, and Campus Police would give them one.

‘Thrower would greatly appreciate input from students on whetheror .
not they would support this system of registration.
