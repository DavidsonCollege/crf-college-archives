Friday, February 7, 1986 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Wildcats rally to down VMI’s Keydets

By BOYD COGGINS

The Cats overcame a sluggish
start last Saturday night to win
their ninth straight home game as
they defeated the Keydets from
VMI 75-68. The win boosted the
Cats record to 6-3 in the confer-
ence and 13-7 overall.

VMI built an early 7-0 lead
three minutes into the game before
Davidson scored its first points on
two free throws by senior Gerry
Born. The Keydets extended their
lead to 11-2 before Born hit the
Cats’ first field goal with 15 mi-
nutes and 20 seconds left in the
half.

The Cats continued to sputter
offensively as VMI’s man-to-man
defense closed off Davidson’s
passing lanes. The Keydets inter-
cepted several Davidson passes
which they converted into easy
baskets.

With nine minutes and 47 sec-
onds left in the half VMI built a
21-8 lead which left the 2,300
Davidson faithful in shock.
Through the first 11 minutes of the
game Davidson scored only two
field goals.

At this point the Cats got on
track as sophomore point guard
Derek Rucker buried an 18-foot
jump shot. He was fouled after the
shot which gave Davidson the ball
out of bounds. Then junior for-
ward Ace Tanner buried a jumper
from the top of the key to cut the
deficit to nine at 21-12 with 8:25
left in the half.

The Cats continued their ag-
gressive offensive attack for the
remainder of the half by outscor-
ing the Keydets 12-2 to reduce the
deficit to only three at halftime 29-
26.

The Cats continued their hot

Davidson Women

crush Meredith at

home

By MIKE ADAMS

After a close first half, the
Lady Cats blew out Meredith Col-
lege in the second behind the
shooting of freshman center
Lavetta Dawkins and junior for-
ward Jennifer Artman to notch a
69-52 home victory.

Meredith played tough in the
first half, but was hurt by early
foul trouble. They put the Cats in
the bonus at the 12:25 mark.
Davidson used Meredith’s foul
trouble to good advantage. The
Lady Cats hit some free throws
and attacked the Meredith defense
more effectively in the last 12 mi-
nutes of the half to build a 30-26
lead.

The Lady Cats wore Meredith
down in the second half. Using
various zone defenses, Davidson
forced several turnovers. Both
Dawkins and Artman deflected
several passes that led to Meredith

turnovers. The Lady Cats went up
by 10 at the 15:34 mark and had
built the lead to 17 with 6:42 left in
the game.

Meredith made a run at this
point and cut the lead to nine with
four minutes left. Davidson
turned them beck, however, with
good defensive pressure and scor-
ing from Dawkins and settled for a
17-point victory.

Dawkins finished with 18 sec-
ond-half points to give her a
game-high 28. Junior center Pam
Harmann scored seven of her nine
points in the second half and Jen-
nifer Artman hit 10 second-half
points to give her 21 for the game.

The victory moved the Lady
Cats to 7-6 on the season, while
Meredith dropped to 6-4. David-
son played without junior Heather
McKee who missed the game be-
cause of sickness.

shooting to open the second half
as they outscored VMI 10-2 to
take a 36-31 lead with 15 minutes
left in the game. During this streak
they got four points each from
Rucker and Tanner as well as a
fastbreak layup by sophomore for-
ward Jeff Himes.

The Cats extended their ad-
vantage to 14 points when junior
Chris Heineman hit two free
throws with seven minutes left in
the game. They built this lead by
playing an aggressive man-to-
man defense which forced the
Keydets to take bad outside shots
and commit several turnovers.
Tanner’s defense of VMI’s lead-
ing scorer Gay Elmore was excel-
lent as he forced the sharp shooter
to miss badly on several shots to
the delight of the crowd.

From the 13-point deficit
Davidson outscored the Keydets

49-22 to take the lead at 57-3. In
this comeback stretch they hit 16-
19 field goals for a sizzling 84 per-
cent.

The Cats stayed on top for the
rest of the game by hitting clutch
foul shots and by working the ball
inside for layups. VMI made a late
run by cutting the Cats lead to five
points with 30 seconds left in the
game. But it was too little too late
for the Keydets as Rucker finished
them off by making both ends of a
one-and-one to preserve the
seven-point margin of victory.

For the game Davidson hit an
outstanding 57.5 percent of their
field goal attempts by going 27-
47. The Cats had three men in
double figures in scoring with
Rucker, the team’s top scorer at
13.0 ppg, leading the way with 21
points. He was followed by Himes
and Heineman, who had 15 and 12

points respectively. The Cats’ de-
fense also forced the Keydets to
turn the ball over 20 times while
Davidson only committed 13 of
their own.

Of special interest in this game
was the halftime shooting contest
held at every Davidson home
game. In this contest junior Steve
Bradley, who is the starting quar-
terback on the football team, won
a trip for two to Nassua in the
Bahamas when he swished a shot
from halfcourt. However, NCAA
regulations will not allow him to
claim this fun-in-the-sun vaca-
tion.

This victory put the Cats in
third place in the conference be-
fore Monday night’s game against
Marshall. They trailed Marshall
and UT-Chattanooga by only one
game with seven games yet to be
played.
