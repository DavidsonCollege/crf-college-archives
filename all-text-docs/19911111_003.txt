Davidson Mathematics Initiates
Honor Society in Bernard's Name

Courtesy of College Relations

Excellence in mathematics at
Davidson will henceforth be
marked by membership in the
Bernard Society, a group named in
honor of a guiding light in the
department for almost 30 years
who could draw a perfect circle on
the blackboard.

“Yes, [guess I did draw apretty
good circle,” laughed Richard R.
Bernard, a 74-year-old professor
emeritus living his retirement in
Davidson. “My father taught me
that; he was a math teacher, too.”
Bernard said he drew small circles
by using his elbow as a pivot point
and sweeping backwards, and big
circles pivoting around his shoul-
der. But he shied away from giv-
ing a demonstration, saying the
nine years since his retirement have
rendered that skill rusty.

While students applauded
Bernard blackboard ‘circles, he
taught them a great deal more than
skill with a piece of chalk. When
he came to Davidson in 1955, he
regularly taught five courses. He
introduced a course in topology to
Davidson in 1957 at a time when
that subject was seldom taught at
undergraduate institutions, and no
textbook was available.

The 27 junior and senior stu-
dents: who were inducted as the
firstmembers of the Bernard Soci-
ety ata dinner on Thursday, Octo-
ber 31,/all received a pin embla-

zoned with a common symbol of
topology, the Mobeius strip, as a
sign of their membership. Society
members also.receive a member-
ship in the Mathematical Associa-
tion of America.

The Davidson math depuart-
ment has created The Bernard
Society to promote and recognize
math at Davidson. All mathemat-
ics majors will be inducted, as well
as a few other students who show
high aptitude and enthusiasm for
the subject. The society will also
invite a renowned speaker to cam-
pus annually to lecture on mathe-
matics.

society are listed below:

abortion choices, protection of
privacy issues, counseling strate-
gies, and the debate between vol-
untary and mandatory testing. Dr.
Fletcher said that the new technol-
ogy, ‘vastly magnifies the number
of people effected by these prob-
lems.”

Dr. Fletcher then discussed
different views of the ethical prob-

lems. He touched on religious
ideas, the women’s point of view,
and ideas from those with disabili-
ties. The tension between conser-
vative and liberal traditions con-
cerning the rights of the unborn
remains great. Dr. Fletcher be-
lieves that with the explosion of
technology and the ethical prob-
lems facing the genetic field,
“human geneticists have a special
responsibility to lead the way into
the future.”

The response to the letters from the faculty and staff is excellent so far,
Terry said, and he hopes that an even larger amount of students will also
respond and wish to work with this group or choose to attend the forum.
