TOURNAMENT TALK

The victories over William & Mary and Richmond
last weekend virtually clinched a hesth tor Davidson in
this year’s Southern Conference tournament, which is
slated for March 1-3.

However, a win over VMI tomorrow night would |
mathematically clinch a berth in the tourney. If the Wild- |
cats down the Keydets, they would have a 5-3 record, |
with three conference games remaining. So the worst |
record with which they could finish would be 5-6.

Meanwhile, The Citadel is currently 1-7 in league |
play, with four remaining games. The best the Bulldogs
can finish is 5-7. But the Bulldogs, which were picked to
finish third in pre-season standings, are not entirely out
of the picture. They may easily pass William & Mary
(3-9 with four more games) before the season ends.

However, getting into the tournament, which has
been the biggest problem for recent Wildcat fives, is not
a problem or the worry of this year’s contingent. The

’Cats are a shoo-in this year, and the big struggle is to try |

to finish third in the standings, in order that powerful
West Virginia would not be met until the final game.

This will be the first year since 1958-59 that a Dav-
idson team has been in the tournament. That year the
Wildcats, which finished 8th in regular season play ahead
of VMI, met the nationally ranked Mounties in the open-
ing round and weré thoroughly trounced.

Incidentally, the ’Cats got a look at the site of this
year’s tourney when they beat Richmond this past Mon-
day night in the Richmond Arena. Many people feel that
the Arena, which seats 5,000 people, is not the place for
the tourney. VPI would, quite naturally, like to bring it
to their new field house, which seats 10,000, and in which
the Gobblers have yet to be defeated. However, Blacks-
burg lacks adequate hotel and eating facilities to ac-
commodate players, coaches, press, and fans.

Lefty Driesell offers the best solution to the prob-
lem—the Charlotte Coliseum. The Queen City, which is
centrally located, has excellent overnight and eating

in Johnston Gym.

Least concerned with the
whole matter is Coach Lefty
Driesell and his miracle men,
who keep taking them one at a
time. Says Driesell, “We're not
concerned right now with how
long this streak will last. We're
only concerned with how we're
going to beat VMI.”

REVENGE GAME

The Wildcats will be after
more than another win tomor-
row night when the Keydets

chair) and LEFTY DRIESELL

facilities, and the Coliseum would be a neutral court.

A NICKEL WILL DO IT

If you find an extra nickel in your pocket tonight,
how about picking up a copy of today’s Charlotte News.
Max Muhleman of the News and a photographer graced
our campus Wednesday in search of the effect of the
winning streak on our school. Muhieman has written a
big feature on his visit, and the article is in today’s
edition.

And speaking of sports writers, we accept George
Cunningham's apology in Wednesday morning’s Observer.

Cunningham was careful to point out that the WILD- |
CATS (instead of Tamecats) have the nation’s fourth long-
est winning streak, “exceeded only by Ohio State (17)
straight) and Kentucky and Oregon State (15 each).” |

Just keep giving us that front page coverage, Mr. |
Cunningham, no matter what you call us.

VMI Visits ’Cat Cage

Cagers (12-6) Triumph In Virginia;
Hit Clemson Here Monday Night

“How long will it last?” is the 64 thousand dollar question that Davidson basket-
ball fans (and non-Davidson fans) keep asking themselves with each and every Wild-
cat victory, and as tension mounts concerning tomorrow night’s 8:15 clash with VMI

N. Y. Halberstadt, who main-
tains a 20-plus point scoring
average, is considered the best
outside shot in the Southern
Conference.

6-7 sophomore Bobby Watson,
a deluxe rebounder, gives the
Keydets the big man they have
been lacking for so long, while
seniors Gene Lazaroff and Wel-
don Eddins provide added scor-
ing punch to the VMI attack.

CRUCIAL WINS

The ’Cats continued their win-
ning ways on a recent journey
into Virginia. During this cru-
cial road trip they thumped
William & Mary, 61-54, and
Richmond, 55-52.

6-7 sophomore Terry Holland
paced the win over William &
Mary by pouring in 20 points
and nabbing 13 rebounds. Big
Bill Jarman directed the Rich-
mond victory with 19 points, in-
cluding 9 for 11 free throws, and
12 rebounds.

Bill Beerman, D. G. Martin,
and Haywood Evans also spark-
ed in the two wins. Beerman
scored 11 points against W&M,
and held Richmond star John
Telepo to 6 points. Martin was
his usual scrappy self, hauling
down 9 and 8 rebounds in each
game, and throwing in vital
points both nights. Evans pump-
ed in 10 against W&M, and two
of his 11 against Richmond were
last second free throws, which
| clinched the game.

Strong FieldLeft —
Whittlemen Behind

“Under the circumstances, | |
think the boys did as well as
could be expected,” said track
coach Heath Whittle after Dav-
idson’s indoor runners failed to
place in the VMI. Relays held at
Lexington, Virginia, last Satur-
day.

Over 400 athletes were enter-
ed from Navy, Duke, UNC, Mary-
land, William & Mary, East Ten-
nessee, Mt. Saint Mary’s, The
Citadel, VPI, VMI, and Davidson.
Whittle termed it “the fastest
and best meet ever.”

Four meet records were either
broken or tied, with All-Ameri-
can football end Greg Mather of
Navy leading the way with a
record-breaking 54’-1%” toss of
the shotput.

Davidson entered Bob Cordle
in the 60-yard dash, Andy Boggs
in the shotput, and Ken Kelley,
John Harris, John Sharp, and
Dick Eberhart in the 880-yd.
and mile relays.

Team scores were not kept,
but the University of Maryland
easily won the most first places
with five. Navy and UNC were
second with two each.
