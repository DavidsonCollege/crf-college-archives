THE DAVIDSONIAN

2008 Vice Presidential Candidates

SGA

ALI KARAMI-RUIZ

Hi, I’m a junior from Querétaro,
Mexico. I am running for SGA vice
president to bring you tangible
results. As vice president, I'll make
the SGA more transparent, pro-
mote environmental sustainability
and reform the S.T.R.I.-D.E. pro-
gram. Despite recent progress, the
student body still feels disconnect-
ed from SGA. I plan to bring SGA
to you by building a complete web-
site featuring not only the academ-
ic blog but also current and past
SGA meetings and a list of all
members and positions. I will work
with President Ross and the EAC to
continue to strengthen the college’s
efforts to become more environ-
mentally sustainable, through
water conservation and curtailing
energy use. If we are to best inte-
grate the student body, then we
need to reform the S.T.R.I.D.E.
program — beginning with pre-ori-
entation. Though S.T.R.LD.E. is
designed to help minority students
adapt to the Davidson community,
pre-orientation in its current form
has done the exact opposite. We
can improve on a program that pre-
disposes its participants to associ-
ate only with other minority stu-
dents and furthers the notion that
they should be treated differently.
As SGA vice president, I will make
our student government more visi-
ble, work for environmental sus-
tainability and help us more effec-
tively learn from each other. I will
bring SGA to you.

SGA needs an individual that
exemplifies hard work at the posi-
tion of vice president. No one per-
son does that better than me. I am
a religion major, Davidson College
football player, economics minor,
Davidson Investment Financial
Association member, member of
the BSC and community service
participant. Therefore, I have an
understanding of several different
spectrums of the Davidson cam-
pus. Not many candidates can say
they are knowledgeable of reli-
gious life, social life, academic
life, as well as diversity at
Davidson. A candidate needs to be
someone that understands a wide
variety of individuals so as to hear
all concerns. Combine this know]-
edge with my hard-work and
things will get accomplished on
this campus. As vice president, I
will help to expand the “Real Talk”
sessions implemented by Chris
Burton to include concerns
brought up by the students. This
will be a great way to hear the
problems of the students (the driv-
ing force of Davidson College) and
therefore make the necessary com-
promises. Another way that I
intend to vocalize the needs of the
students is to have a suggestion
box placed in the Union. My
efforts in unison with the SGA
President will make SGA (the
voice of the students) a stronger

body.

Union Board

DJ SINGLETERRY

Hello. I’m running for the office
of Union Board Vice President.

AS a proactive member of the
Union Board, I helped to mobilize
the student body to participate in
campus events through multi-media
propaganda. This year, we had our
highest attendance at RSC events in
recent years and brought in new
vendors and old hits such as Build-
a-Bear and Paint Your Own Pottery.

As vice president, I would look
to revamp some of the annual pro-
grams under the Special Events
budget like the Campus Christmas
party, Casino Night and Spring
Frolics.

This year has been a great learn-
ing experience, allowing me to
work behind the scenes on some of
the larger campus programs and see
first hand what it takes to put on a
memorable event.

Next year, if I’m elected vice
president I promise to not only con-
tinue and expand weekend events
for all students, but also to encour-
age the student body’s attendance at
open meetings to try and truly get a
picture of the campus’s voice.

Thank you for your time. It
would be my pleasure to serve you
as Union Board Vice President.

I experienced my first movie,
“Snow White”, in the 900 Room.
While I have no memory of that
viewing (and wish it was some-
thing cooler like “Braveheart”),
many more memorable firsts have
taken place in the College Union. I
sat in Santa’s lap, learned who the
Rev. Dr. King was and shot my
first pool. The Union sponsored
the first and some of the best con-
certs (Dave Matthews, Ben Folds,
Black Eyed Peas) I have attended.
T owe my appreciation for the arts
to the Union Board’s Artists’
Series. As a student, I have served
the Union as 900 Room Bar
Manager and through Davidson
Outdoors, the Ticket Office and

Tech Crew. I’m excited about the -

opportunity to further contribute
my time and talents to this Board
in order to serve and represent the
diverse interests and perspectives
of the college community. The
Union is much more to me than a
nostalgic memory. It is a living,
breathing body that has great
potential to innovate and serve. As
your Union Board Vice President I
will welcome and encourage your
input as we work to fulfill our
community’s potential to bring
People together.

ALLISON RUHE

So, in case you don’t know me,
or even know what the Union
Board is...here it goes...

My name is Allison Ruhe (pro-
nounced like kangaroo if you’re
wondering!) and I’m running for
Union Board Vice President.

Maybe you have seen me hand-
ing out Chick-fil-A at After
Midnights, driving Santa and Mrs.
Claus in the golf cart at the
Campus Christmas Party or hang-
ing out at the lake campus on the
Sunday before school started last
semester.

Whether you know it or not,
these events were brought to the
campus by the Union Board.

This year, I have been working
on events such as these as the
Union Board Lake Campus
Committee Chair and Member-At-
Large.

My freshman year, I also was an
active member of the Recess com-
mittee.

I believe that my creativity, moti-
vation, organization and fun-loving
personality make me a good candi-
date for the position of Vice
President.

I promise that as vice president, I
will do my best to bring fun events
to campus next year.
