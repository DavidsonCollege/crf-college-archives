Cagers Seeking Top Twenty Ranking

By ‘foun sstniner

“I think a this peal be
the best team ever at David-
son,’’ said head coach Terry
Holland when assessing the
basketball team's potential.

The Cats are certainly the
most experienced team in the
Southern Conference this year
as only one starter was lost
from last year’s 18-9 squad.
Holland pointed out that last
year’s squad could have easily
been a 21-6 team as three of
the team’s losses came on
missed free throws in the last
minute.

Holland has reason to be op-
timistic even though the Cats
don't have an established star
this season.

‘We don't have an Aill-
American this year, but our
first seven men are so close to
each other in ability that we
should be able to beat just
about any of the teams we
play,” Holland said.

Holland feels that the Cats
will be able to win with their
bench strength this year, as
the team has six players who
have started at one time or
another.

The team plans to employ a
running game this year in or-
der to force the opposition to
Substitute freely.

“If we went with our start-:

ing five, then we probably

wouldn't win that many
games, but if we can force the
tempo to pick up, then we
think that our sixth, seventh
and eighth men will be able to
beat the other team’s sixth,
seventh and eighth men,”
Holland explained.

The team opens against
Wofford Monday in Johnston
Gym. Prior to the opener, they
will play the Australian
National team in a tune-up
tonight.

Holland named Mike
Sorrentino, John Falconi,
Larry Horowitz, Greg Dunn
and Sheldon Parker -as. the
starting five for next Mon-
day’s game against Wofford.
Eppa Rixey, Paul Wagner,
Jay Powell and T. J. Pecorak
will be used in reserve and
should see a lot of playing
time.

‘Right now any one of those
nine players could start for us
with the exception of T.J.,”
said Holland.

Pecorak, a starter all last
year, has been injured during
much of the pre-season prac-
tices with a bruised heel and
pulled hamstring. Holland ex-
pects him to take over a star-
ting position as soon as he is
eble, hopefully within the next
week.

The Cats will also use the
same defense as last year, he

Aussies Visit Cats
In Classic Rematch

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE
Sports Editor

The Davidson Wildcats will
get their first test in their up-
coming basketball season
this evening when the
Australian Olympic team
comes to Johnston Gym.

Head coach Terry Holland
and his heavily experienced
squad will be out to avenge a
previous 94-60 thrashing that
this same Aussie club gave
them during their tour of
Australia this past summer.

The Kangaroos, coached by
Lindsey Gaze, finished ninth
in the 1972 Olympics at
Munich, Germany. Their 1973
record before they began their
tour of the United States was
4-0.

Leading the Aussies in this
week's event will be Ian Wat-
son, a 6-0 guard. Last season
he paced the Kangaroos in the
playmaking department. He
averaged 13 points and six
assists per contest. His speed
and quick hands will be a key
asset in off-setting a probable
pressing defense by the Cats.

At the other backcourt slot
will be Bruce Case. Having
good height for a guard at 6-3,
he has the abilities which
make a top notch guard. In the
State championship last
season he averaged 20 points
per contest.

In the front court the
Aussies will most likely go
with Paul Franke at one for-
ward position. His 6-8 frame
gives him excellent shooting
range inside. He is also an ex-
cellent shooter from the out-

me et ws a

unique ability to be both a
guard and a front court man.
Tony Barnett, who has good
height for a swing man at 6-6,
averaged 15 points per game
during championship com-
petition last season.

The center position is up for
grabs. Most likely it will go to
Ray Tomlinson. Despite being
only 6-6, he usually draws the
defensive assignment opposite
the opposing center. He has
the advantage of experience

defense about 50 percent of the
time, a zone about 30 percent,
and pressing 20 percent,”
Holland said. ‘‘We may use
the press a little more this
year because I think we'll be a
stronger pressing team than
last year.”

Holland feels that the team
is in the best physical shape
that it has ever been in and
that this could be the deciding
factor in some of the early
games.

The team's major ob-
jectives this season will be to
win 20 games, winning the
Southern Conference regular
season title, the conference
tournament, and a ranking in
the top 20 teams in the nation.

Davidson's biggest threats
in the conference will be Fur-
man and Richmond according
to Holland.

“The Brown and St. John’s
games will be a good test for
getting into the top 20,”
Holland said.

“Both games are early in
the season and both teams are
in a similar position as we are,
the winner of the games will
probably get some national
recognition.’’

The Cats face a particularly
rough schedule this year,
playing two teams already
picked for the top 10 in the
nation. The games against
North Carolina State and
Notre Dame will both be on
the road as well.

‘“‘As we've toughened up our
schedule, it’s becoming har-
der to get a winning streak of
seven or eight games going. If
we win some of our big games
early in the season, then we
should be able to build up
some momentum,’ Holland
said.
