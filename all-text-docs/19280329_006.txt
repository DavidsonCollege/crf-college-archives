Facsi

ile Drawings of Old Masters

on Temporary Exhibition in Library

President Martin has arranged with
THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF
ARTS for another exhibit, and the pic-
tures are now on display, during the li-
brary hours, in Rooms 4 and 8.

These are facsimile drawings of the
old Masters, selected from the Italian,
Flemish, Dutch, German, and French
Schools, there being thirty-three in the
group.

The apreciation of art, and especially 4
of painting, is attained only when one first
of all places himself before the works of
the old masters, and then, picking up any
book on art, studies the method and life
of the artist. This has been made possible
at this time, In both rooms will be found
several books on the subject of art. The
index of each book will lead you to the
sketch of each of the masters represented
in the collection. For those who do not
wish to go that far Professor Cullum will
be at the library between 2:00 and 4:00
p. m. on Saturday to assist anyone in in-
terpreting these works of art. The pic-
tures will be here until April 3rd.

In Deep Water

A certain preacher’s theme was the par-
able of the tares among the wheat, and
he dwelt on the inter-mixture of good and
evil ,in the church. “This may seem
strange to us,” he said. “But we must

“Law as a Calling’’ .
Treated by Marion

Outlining the origin and development of
law, Judge J. H. Marion, of Charlotte,
counsel for the Duke Power Co., Friday
evening presented a stirring call for young
men of talents, training and character in
the legal profession. Judge Marion’s ad-
\dress was the concluding feature of the
week devoted to a discussion of law by
officials ofthe Vocational Guidance In-
stitute, now being conducted by the Da-
vidson Y. M. C. A. for the benefit of
local students.

Judge Marion emphasized the offerings
of corporation law as a profession, de-
claring that the law relating to corpora-
tions was identical to that relating to in-
dividual. “A corporation is an artificial
person, sometimes invisible, but always
having a name, and possessing teh same
rights of redress and the’ same responsi-
bilities for its conduct as an individual
person,” he declared.

Something Like That

The big business man did a noble deed.

“His conscience hurts him,” said the
stenographer,

“He wants. publicity,” said the book-
keeper.

“Building up good-will in the com-
munity,” said the shipping clerk.

not forget that there was a Ham in the
Ark.” Then, evidently-thinking that this
might sound rather odd, and be open to!
misconstruction, he corrected himself and
added, “I mean, of course, a human Ham.”

“His wife made him do it,” said the
lephone girl.
“He'd just had a swell dinner,” said the
office boy.

Aand all of them were right—J. A. S.

Who’s Who in World of
Sports Includes Currie

Makes Record Achievement While
With Newark Athletic Club
Last Summer

New honor has been brought to David-
son athletics by the selection of John Cur-
rie as one of two North Carolina ath-
letes who are eligible to a place in Who’s
Who in World of Sports, a publication is-
sued by a Washnigton concern once every
five years. The-other North Carolina na-
tive son to be so honored is Warren of
Carolina.

Qualifications necessary to receive this
honor are that an athlete shall distinguish
himself at an official meet conducted by
the American Athletic Union. At such
meet he must make a record or be on a
team making a record according to official
timing which will be recognized as a new
world mark. |

Currie’s record-breaking achievement
came last summer while with the Newark
Athletic Club. In a national meet held at
Lincoln, Neb., four of the Newark track
flashes, Henry Cummings, John Currie,
James Pappas, and Chester Bowman, set
a new mark for the 440 relay of 41 seconds
flat. This same record had been shattered
three times in the five minutes preceding
the feat of the Newark club.

In winning this event Newark and Cur-
rie were up against some real competi-
tion as evidenced by the fact that they
defeated Paddock and his relay team from
California, Jackson Scholtz and his team
from New York, and the Chicago team of
which Murchison was a member.

Currie was also a member of the relay
team which finished second in the 880 re-
lay event.

The athletic annual in which Currie and
Warren will have a-place will contain the
names of five thousand athletes along
with their records and includes every
Coaches producing
championship teams are also included in
this annual.

The task of gathering the material for
this publication has been completed and
it is expected off the press in the near
future. :

ball gamé of the season. The game will

decisive score. The Kittens ran up five
points, keeping the Cats shut completely
out until the last inning when an outfield
error gave the Varsity a home-run. The
final score was five to two. The excellent
box work of Marrow was the fresh team’s
feature. :

Chapel Hill, N.C, Feb. 12 (CP) — A
woman delivered a regular University lec-
ture for the first time in the history of
the University when Mrs. Elizabeth
O’Neil Verner noted Charleston, S. C.,
artist, spoke here Thursday hight on “The
South in Relation to Art.”

Mrs. Verner occupies a prominent place
in the art world. She is one of the
country’s most distinguished etchers, and
is a member of the New York National
Arts Club and the Pennsylvania Academy
of Fine Arts.

In speaking of the South’s, possibilities
for art, Mrs. Verner said that the Uni-
versity would make an excellent begin-
ning point. She mentioned the Carolina
Playmakers and the Music Department as
a foundation on which to build.

“We have the materials in the South
for an immortal art,” the speaker said,
“and I challenge any section of the coun-
try to produce anything like what the
word ‘South’ embraces. It tells a story
of glory, of suffering, prosperity, inheri-
tance, and all those things that we have
for a background”

The artist continued that the South had
not been closely connected with art in
the past and that the fact was deplogable.
There is art in the South,” she said, “but
we must take it in order to make it ours—
this means work.

“We have merely thought of our Sou-
thern art long enough, we have lived on
imported art long enough. I personally
think that it is better to grow weeds in
one’s own ‘garden than to import or-
chids.”

This was the last University lecture of
the year,,the program having included
Will Durant, Bliss Carmen, Dr. David A.
Roberts, and Dr, Jiri V. Danes.

Honest, at Least

’Twas the day before Christmas, Willie
Jones broke a window with a snowball
sassed his mother, got his new suit full
of slush, broke the dial on the radio and
took father’s fountain pen to draw pic-
tures with,

“Thank godness,” sighed Papa Jones,
“my boy is not a hypocrite !”—Life.

Their Start

Alice—Dad, do you think George is
making enough to support me?”

Father—“Yes, déar. That’s more than
I was making when I married.”

Alice—“Bu do you think a seven-room
house is large enough for us?”

Father—“Certainly. Your mother and
I started fighting in three rooms.”

Suits fo

LITERARY SOCIETIES

Eumanean

The subject for debate in the Eumanean
Literary society Thursday evening, March
26, was “Resolved: That the United
States Should Adopt a Policy of Financial
Aid for Agriculture.” The affirmative was
upheld by John Preston and Jack
Matthews and the negative by Dick
Flynn and Mac King. The decision was
two to one in favor of the negative.

A declamation was given by Jennings
Dennis. The feature of the program was
a talk by Riggs McConnell. In a well
planed and clearly stated speech he showed
the evils which the South has wrought
upon herself by voting solidly Democratic.
A show of the hands which he asked for
at the beginning of his talk amply justi-
fied him in his contention that most
Southerners are Democratic by tradition.
He plead for the use of more discretion in
the exercise of the franchise and less
party spirit. In closing he showed the ad-
vantages the South would enjoy if that
plan were followed through. ~

Philanthropic .

In the Phi Society the query for dis-
cussion was the old but always inter-
esting one, “Resolved: That Capital Pun-
ishment Should be Abolished.” The af-
firmative composed of B. F. Brown and
Charles Kraemer won the decision. The
men upholding the negative were C. Du-
Bose and Wilfred Eppes.

An oration was delivered by M. A.
Morrison which was ‘enjoyed by all those
present.

“Charge It”

They were climbing a lofty peak of the
Alps, and she was standing a few feet
above him, She turned around and gazed
in wonderment. “What,” he asked, “do
you see?” :
1 “Far, far below,” she cried, “I see a
jlong, white sheet stretching like a paper
‘ribbon almost back to our hotel.”

“Ha, ha!” he ejaculated. “It’s that hotel
bill overtaking us.”—Clipped.

A Child’s Version

Both science and history are taught to
good effect in our schools. Although the
facts in a child’s mind may be somewhat
disorderly, they are there, at any rate—
in heaps. In one’ composition a pupil
wrote: “Galileo discoverd the law of the
pendulum when an apple dropped on his
head from the leaning towe rof Pisa.” ss
