Fraternities

Of interest to college students is a quota-
tion taken from/’an interview published by
a prominent university president recently:

“Fraternities and sororities . started
out originally as study groups of students
having similar interests. Of course, they
have an important social function to fulfill,
but if they allow their social function to
overshadow all else, they too, will fall by
their own weight like all other costly, ob-
solete, and ineffective institutions,
“But I don’t believe in taking action a-

if they do their job—as ]

gainst them

hope they may—they will continue to ex-
ist; fail to do they

a
passing.”

During the past few years, social fraterni-
ties have been subjected to bitter criticism
by those who magnify their weak points
and predict their downfall, probably more
so on most other campuses than on our
own,

The pressure of this criticism has pene-
trated to almost every college campus in
the its effect
the rigid control exercised on their activi-

nation, and can be seen in

ties. Many have advocated their abolish-
ment.and have pointed to the undemocratic
feeling engendered on college campuses
with fraternities and other exclusive social
groups. Most of these criticisms, however,
have been based on prejudices and dislikes
rather than on facts.

Though some organizations foster acti-
vities harmful tb the best, development of
students, this fault % in the group rather
than the system. Fraternities must be more
than mere social groups if they are to con-
tinue to exist. They should encourage scho-
larship among their members and play an
active part in extra curricular activities.

lf they moderate their éxcessive social
life and keep active in other affairs, they
will build a-sound foundation for a longer
life; if they do not, they will provide the
means for their own extinction,

Athleties

With the appearance of the January 14
issue of the OLD GOLD AND BLACK, the
Wake Forest College weekly, came a five
column streamer which shouted out, “’Cats

break with Deacons.” Also stated in an-
other position on the front page was a
smaller story printed in bold face type,

which says that Davidson is planning to
drop from the Southern Conference within
the next two-years. The latter, was writ-
ten “Special to Old Gold and Black” and
stated that it came from a “usually reliable

To get right down to brass tacks, why
must you be such rotten: sports? In re-

that they are trained in their art? Do you

not realize that ordinary psychology shows

that they will clamp down on us, the team,

have even heard you boo your own team for
not playing as well as you expect it to. In
my mind the worst offense you bayve com-
mitted is not against your team, but against
visiting teams—which in the last analysis,
is an offense against yourselves. You boo
at their antics, try to bewilder them with
your shouts, and cause’ them to feel in-
sulted by such hospitality and poor sports-
manship. At times in recent games the
members of the team have been so asham-

The Editor

Dear Bill,

Conduct as the basketball games
this year has steadily gone from
bad to worse. Never before in the
last four years have the students
acted in such an unthoughtful man-
ner. I refer to the juvenile practices
of hisses, and catcalls that
have marked our recent games
here on the campus.

This condition is deplorable, and
needs remedying at once. Not only
is it a blot on our reputations as
gentlemen, but it is a practice that
has effect our team. It is
disconcerting to have booing and
hissing, even though it is not di-
rected at you. The players them-
selves have

Dear Bill,

A quotation from last week's

Editorial Page: “The Judge of the
Court of Control has been asking
for the help of the members of the
three upper classes in enforcing the
Freshman Regulations ... we have
done nothing but gripe because the
Court hasn't campused Freshman
Jones for not wearing his cap.”
Every time I reported a
for breaking Regula-
tions, I have been thanked and told
that action would be taken. But
no action has been taken, at any
time, against any of the Freshmen
I have reported.

Perhaps there is very little co-
operation with the Court, but the

have
Freshman

least it can do is avail itself of
what cooperation is given.
There is something more import-
ant that I want to “gripe” about,
though: In Article VII (The Honor
System), Section 3, of the Constitu-
tion’ of the Student Government,
we read, “Every student shall be
honer bound to refrain from steal-
ing.” In spite of this, there is an
almost wholesale practice of steal-
ing Freshman caps. A student tak-
ing a cap is just as guilty as one
who has dollar (or the
equivalent of the price of a cap).
I cannot back my statement with
proof, but I suspect that a large

point this: a great number of

For the of another
cap, two alternatives are left, either
stealing or buying it. Since there
have been no caps for sale at the
Student Store since Christmas, the
alternative of stealing remains. And

without a cap can get a good camp-

I wish to appeal to the Court of
Control to give some consideration
to this matter. I appeal to the Stu-
dent Council to back the Court in
its actions and decisions, And fin-

to get behind these organizations
