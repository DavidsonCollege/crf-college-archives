Boston Poems

The Old Man must have forgotten to plant
his garden this year in Boston and then
suddenly remembered the seeds in his hip

pocket; for the snow was flung furiously,
not with great heaves as it is further
south, but with smoothness, effortlessly,

as leaves in fall are lifted off branches
by the Old Man’s exhalations. Still, the
people shook their heads as buses rolled by

tombstones barely visible and fire hydrants
capped in ice. Christmas wreaths remained
hanging on doors as though a silent plea

fora sdason of peace, and perhaps the people
understood; the bus drove slowly, and for
once, though others stared, there was no hurry.

After buses run again near curbs

and tombstones resume their silent looms

after the toughened sinewy branches burned in open lots
and broken shrubs neatly trimmed

after creaking roofs patched one more time

with sticky prayerful tar

the people will uncaulk the doors

will sweep the porch of winter's sterile dust

and will arrange their newly painted metal porch chairs
in pleasing patterns of twos and threes

for the more acute visitors

(those who say, “Winter is the most

God-awful hell | know”)

the grass will remain trimmed, on display

as will the painted shutters

and the people will return

to live their tortured wintry lives

in the skewered houses

that lie in rows along the bay

and the widow's walks will continue gazing out to sea.

Poster lady

you emptied your eyes to fill a dream of mine

and left me in a crowd without words
Poster lady ‘

with your poster promises and a world to call you own

can you ever take away yourself
and come down from you paper throne?

Poster lady

Well, here | am again

don't you see what’s going wrong?

with your poster-blank eyes

and your income tax lies

Poster lady

can you maybe

take a chance and climb our of your fear
| am here

to take away your poster wares

All your summers

like the last bit of achild

you had to let go

and time just seems to take away
there’s no more meaning
toslow. -° ’
