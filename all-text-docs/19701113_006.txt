The view from the penthouse suite of the North
Carolina National Bank Building in Charlotte is very
clear. All the Southern Conference basketball coaches
and sports writers had gathered there for cocktails
and lunch. For two and a half hours Monday morning
they had discussed their teams’ chances for the bas-
ketball «title. The decision as to who would finish
first isn’t so clear.

‘On the way to lunch, Whitey Kelley of the Ob-
server, mentioned’to Terry Holland that ‘everybody
in the league wants a piece of Davidson.” East Car-
olina, Furman, and The Citadel feel this could be
their year and agree that Davidson is the team to
beat for the title.

The consensus of the coaches in their two day.

meeting at the Manger Motor Inn in. Charlotte was
that any team in the league can beat any. other on
any given day. Richmond’s Lewis Mills felt that ‘“‘the
team who can win on the road will win the title.”

“I will be surprised if someone dominates the
league,” said VMI’s Mike Schuler. “The winner will
lose twa or three games. Davidson is deserving of
‘being the favorite until someone can. show that
they can be beaten.”

‘Il go along with Schuler and pick the Wildcat’s
on the basis of their winning tradition and wealth
of talent. (see related stories on the Wildcats and
their opponents) The job of defending the title will
be tougher than past season’s and the loss of Maloy,
Kroll, and Cook will have to hurt.

East Carolina, Furman, and The Citadel should
finish second through. fourth and I wouldn’t be sur-
prised to see one of them sneak off with the title.
Richmond should finish fifth while William and
Mary and VMI fight to stay out of the cellar.

Assorted comments and opinions from the two
day meeting:

Tom Quinn of East Carolina has a very positive
attitude toward his program. With only three re-
turning player he’s looking forward to an _ out-
standing year. Two of those, Jim Gregory and Jim
Fairley, he rated among the conference’s top five
performers. ;

Quinn feels that one of the top sophomores in
the Conference ‘will be ECU’s Dave “The Eel’: Mc-
Neil. “I’m not comparing him to Charlie Scott but
he sure looks like him at times.”

Quinn has a hang-up on nicknames. Besides
“The Eel” he has the “Glassman,” “Elevator Man,”
“Wolfman,” “Bronson,” and ‘Country Spider” to
man his ‘“‘yo-yo offense” and “74 double-aught de-
fense.”

Furman’‘s Joe Williams showed his preference
for flashy clothes at the meeting. His gold double-
breasted suit was reminiscent of some of the out-
fits he wore to _brighten—up-NBC’s—eelor— coverage
of his Jacksonville squad in the NCAA tournament
last year.

Williams explained his reason for his team’s
tendency to run up the score board. “This type of
basketball is more exciting and the boys are much
happier High scoring teams also attract better high
school players to your school.”

Optimist of the year award at the two day meet-
ing goes to VMI’s Mike Schuler. Schuler predicted
that his Keydets will be “on top of the Southern Con-
ference” in two more seasons. VMI was 6-19 last
year.

William and Mary has built a 5.3 million dollar
basketball facility and has an ambitious schedule
including Jacksonville, UCLA,, North Carolina, and
Wake Forest. Unfortunately the Indians don’t have
the pergonnel to match either.

Eleven junior college transfers have been add-
ed to Southern Conference teams. Davidson, with its
tough entrance requirements, is without one.

Davidson’s Sports Information Director Emil

Parker has questioned the wisdom of the-selection«

of the conference) player of the week award.

_ “Presently all the SID’s and coaches submit their
nominee to Dallas Shirley (an SC official) and he
makes the decision,” Parker. said. “I’m questioning
his..wisdom.”

_ Parker suggests a panel of coaches and SID’s
making the weekly selection which from here seems
to be a sound: and constructive suggestion.

Last week Phil Mosser of William and Mary
was chosen for the award. Mosser scored three TD’s
in William and Mary’s win. x ;

Wildcats Face

Davidson opens its 1970-71
basketball, campaign later
than usual ‘this year and
faces one of the toughest
challengers, | East' Carolina,
in the opener on Dec. 9:

Exams have forced the
Wildcats to open later and
Coach HoNand feels that the
advantages in the late start
will equal the disadvantages.

“We'll have more: time
to scout our first opponent
but-they- will also have two
games to prepare themselves
for. us in,” Holland said.

East Carolina will offer
two of the leagues better
players in Jim Fairley and
Jim Gregory. 6-10 center Al
Faber should make the Pi-
rates tougher.

Dave McNeii, Julius
Prince, and Mike Henrich
will give them adequate

Davidson has to face SC
foes only nine times this
year and faces many of the
nation’s better teams to com-
plete their 25 game sche-
dule.

South Carolina, who has a
good chance at the NCAA
title, will be the toughest
foe. The Cats will meet the
Gamecocks in Charlotte on
Feb. 10.

Only Bobby Cremmins has
departed Columbia but he
will be adequately replaced
by sensational Kevin Joyce.

Casey Manning and seven
foot Danny Traylor will join
John Roche, Tom Owens,

Tom Riker, John Ribock,
Rick Aydlett, and Bobby
Carver.

Wake Forest, Duke, and
N. C. State of the ACC will
also provide the ’Cats with
tough assignments.

The ’Cats will have to face
some of the Eastern powers
again this year. St. John’s,
Princeton, St. Joseph, arid

; ule.

Holland countered by say-
ing that most of the players
on ‘Davidson’s team had
been practicing against
them for several years and
have to be pretty good after
going ‘through ail that.

“I do think we can win 20
games,’’ said Holland. ‘I
think we can win the con-
ference championship and go
a long way in the NOAA.”

(Holland was quick to men-
tion Bryan Adrian and label-

‘ed him-an All-American pro-

spect.

‘‘He walks on the floor and
most people laugh while I
cry. He is a scorer. He’s not

a great shooter but he makes

several little moves and the
next thing you know he has
beaten you.”

Holland said that David-
son needs a big man and
mentioned the role Eric Min-
kin must play.

“He is very strong and
agressive. He had a frustrat-
ing season and a good deal
of the responsibility will fat!
on his shoulders.”

John. Pecorak was the
third Wildcat Holland men-
tioned who would be in, the
starting line-up.

“John is a competitor the
way Wayne Huckel was. I'd
sure hate tto be playing
ahead of him."’

The question as to who
will start at the point is still
uncertain. Holland said the
race is between Ron Stel-
zer and Billy Pierce.

“Pierce is giving Stelzer
a run for his money,'’ he
said and ‘‘has the edge on
defense. Stelzer has a
lot more game experience

and is a_ slightly better
shooter.”’
Holland reminded the

group that Steve Kirley was
the second leading freshman
scorer in the school’s _his-
tory.

“This year Steve has to
be a scorer. He's a fine out-
side shooter and the fastest
man on the team. Last year
he did an excellent defen-
sive job on South Carolina’s
John Roche.”

-The need for another scor-

er in the line-up brought
Holland to sophomore Gor-
don Graham.

“Gordon is a great shoot-
er but isn’t that quick. It
will be tough to have him
and Adrian in the line-up at
the same time. Both are just

“modest defensive players.”

Holland also mentioned the
possibility of Joe Sutter, Les-
ter Strong, or Dunan Postma
working their way into the
Starting five.-

“Joe is a good shooter
from 15-18 feet and could
easily be a starter. He is
an  outstandifig defensive
player but facks stamina.”

Holland said that Strong
was a fine jumper and has
improved his shooting. He
also noted that it was un-

‘fortunate he wasn’t able to

see a lot of action last sea-
son,

Postma, acording to Hol-
land, could work into ‘the
line-up at the wing or point.
He cited his shooting incon-
sistency as his greatest
drawback, 4 ,
