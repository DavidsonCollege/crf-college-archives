Soccer Club Downs
Celenese Booters

By BRUCE BECKER
Staff Writer

Last Sunday the Davidson Soc.
cer Club defeated the Charlot-
te ‘‘Celenese’’ Soccer Club by a
score of 4-3 in Charlotte.

Two goals apiece were scored
by Dick LeVan and internation.
al student Clement Rousenq.

This Sunday at 2 p.m. the soc-
cer club will meet the Charlotte
Soccer Club.

The Davidson Soccer Club was
recently chartered by the SGA.
It has two primary functions.

First, the club provides an
opportunity for off-season train-
ing for the varsity. Most of the
players will try out for the var-
sity team next fall.

Secondly, but most important-
ly, the club is trying to create
‘an interest in seccer on cam-
pus.

“T want to stress that the
club is not for the varsity play-
ers alone, but for everyone on
campus,” said Tom Toinee.

To help achieve this purpose
the club is sponsoring soccer

films to be shown with no price
of admission to the college com.
munity. Next Tuesday through
Thursday, April 18-20, at 8 p.m.
in Perkins Auditorium it will
show the 1969 Faris Cup: Scot-
land vs. Russia.

‘We don’t want people to be
afraid to join because the var-
sity players are out there. We
want to attract anyone with an
interest in the game,” said Tor-
nee.

The team practices each week
on Monday and Thursday after-
noons on the soccer field.

“The beautiful thing about
soccer,” said Tormee, “is that
soccer is the coly American
sport in which the player does
not need height or weigit.”

The soccer club was originally
organized two years ago by Le-
Van. Interest had warned until
the varsity team won its  se-
cocd championship this past sea-
sou.

The club hopes to organize to
the point that it can afford
good referees, more extensive
uway tuips and more programs.

“The  associa.ion sends its
winner to San Diego to compete
in the natiocals. and we're very
encouraged about our chances,”
stated Lundy.

Tae performance by the squad
in last Satu:day’s meet gives
Lundy a basis for his optimism.

“We had to contend with
Ss rong w-nds and rough water,
but we were able to do well. It
was our best effort so far,” he
noted.

. Lundy and his crewman John
McElveen won their division by
garnering a first and two sec-
ond place finishes, while com-
modore Jimmy Hunter and
crewman Frank Somerville reg-
istered a second, a fifth and a
seventh in their division.

Hunter and Somerville placed
far behind Regatia champicn
The Citadel in their division,
but Lundy's victory gave the
team enough total points for
second place overall.

The team will be practicing
every day in preparation for
the Association championships,
and the two skippers have not
yet been dete: mined.

lundy explained that the pi-
lots who perform the best dur-
ing the practice sessions. will
compete in the championships,
and they will be allowed to
choose taeir own crewmen.

The praccices are supervised
as often as possible by Associate
Professor of © Froach Hallam
Walker.

“He is an excellest sailor in
his own right, and his advice is
valuable to us,” said Lundy.

Lundy anticipates the stiffest
competition in the quest for the
San Diego trip to come from
Tennessee, The Citadel and
Clemson.
