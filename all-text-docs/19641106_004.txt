YOUTHFUL MARINERS AT THE DOCK

Davidson's “Salts” Untangle Sails

The Davidson College Sailing
Club. dedicated to promoting
sailing at the. Lake Campus.
was organized last week, com-
posed of 30 students and facul-
ty members, Though only a
week. old, the Club has already
received its first regatta in-
vitation but declined for a lack
of sufficient operation.

The organization of the club
has been well accepted despite
the brevity of its existence.
The library offered to purchase
sailing books, as well as a
subscription to Yachting maga-
zine. the “‘bible’’ of sailors.

One of the Sailing Club's first
aims is to purchase three to
six middle-sized sail boats,
known as Y Flyers. which they
intend to allow ‘the Physical Ed-
ucation Department to use.
One of the more established
sailing groups. the Lake Nozman
Yacht Club, expressed inierest
in participating in the purchase
of the new boats. Coach Charles
Parker, director of the Lake
Campus water facilities, has
been instrumental in the in-
creased participation in water
sports at Davidson and wil! pro-
bably become _ the. Sailing
Club’s advisor. Club represen-
tatives are Bob Orr and Chip
Robertson. while Tommy Hunt-
er was elected secretary last
week.

Smith Breaks Rushing

Mark Against Furman

By SAM BOYTE
Davidsonian Sports Writer

If a down-hearted Davidson alumnus were to have been asked before last week
what sort of records the Wildcats would set this season, he would probably have

laughed.

He might have gone on to
speculate, ‘Perhaps. most fum-
bles. highest number of points
given up. or maybe. if Yahweh
is with. us. Heckard will set
some sort of passing marks.”

This fountainhead of college
spirit would have overlooked
Davidson's halfback Steve
Smith.

By stepping off 162 yards in
24 ~plays, Smith broke the
Davidson running mark of 159
yards that Jim Thacker set al-
most a decade and a half ago
against Presbyterian College.

Coach Bill Dole exclaimed,
“A fine exhibition of running.
What else can we say?”

Actually he did have a bit
more to say. Dole continued.
“We're glad he got it (the re-
cord). He has been our best
runner all year long. He has
good fluid motion, and he runs
easily.”

Smith, a junior from Camila,
Ga. whose 5° 11" frame weighs
in at 170 pounds, is not the
largest member of the back-
field, but he is generally con-
ceded to be the biggest when
it comes to running form.

It must be pointed out that
this was no one fash of glory
for Smith. He has performed
well all year long, leading the
Wildcats in total running yard-
age, with 360 yards in 84 carries
for an average of 4.6 yards per
carry.

In his sophmore year, Smith
alternated between defensive
and offensive halfback, earning
his letter as a regular on last
year's squad. This year he has
worked almost solely on of-
fense as a result of Dole’s pla
toon system.

It has paid off for Smith be-
cause his natural talent has
been honed to a keen edge.
But says teammate David Sprin-
kle. “Last year Steve wasn't
spinning off exactly right. But
he's got self-confidence, and
he's really conscientious. That
plus his natural talent is pro-
bably what makes him click".

“Now he's aS smooth as can
be. His form is just like a book
on blocking. His pass defense
is just like the still shots you
see in Sports Illustrated. That's
why he’s called ‘Slick’ Smith.”

Smith’s yardage total was
more than that of the entire of-
fensive gain generated by Fur-

man. He accounted for two of i
three touchdowns. !

Davidson's
On the second play of the fourth

quarter, Smith went over tackle '

for the Wildcats’ second six
points. Later he loped. around
right end for 38 yards to give
Davidson its final score of the
game.

Dole felt that Smith's ability
showed up so well this week be-
cause of a strong effort by the
whole team. ‘We've been work-

ing on everything for the whole -

season, and it finally jelled.
The boys put together a fine

game. Better offensive blocking
enabled Steve to see a little
more daylight.” .

Sprinkle added. ‘‘Everybody
was clicking. A boy that they've

Long range plans of the club
include obtaining membersiip
in e:taes the South Atlantic In-
tercollegiate Sailing Associa-
tion. or the Southeastern In-
tercollegiate Sailing Association.
The latter consists of  fil-
teen member clubs which take
turns hosting regattas for the
other members.

The heroes were many. A rug-

fullback Zuberer was met by
Davidson's interior .line and
swarmed under back of his

halftime with the ‘Cats holding

On the first play of the last
quarter the defense again ex-

a Furman fumble to give the
‘Cats possession on the enemy

Smith seized the opportunity

first score of the day. At 6:07

Ortham, who ‘Coach Stevens re-
ports is often used as a split
end. He will be assisted by Joe
Walton at the other end. Tackle
Tony Hrincevich is a fine block-
er and is tough on defense.

Coach Dole hopes to repeat
what happened last week.
“There will be no changes in
the lineup; we'll start with the
same men we used against Fur-
man. That means Jake Jacob-
sen will be leading the ‘Cats
at quarterback.

Dole explained, ‘‘After he
played such a fine game last
week. I can’t tell him to go
back and sit on the bench
again.”

Steve Heckard is fully re-
covered from ‘the flu and
should see plenty of action at
quarterback. With both Heck-
ard and Jacobsen playing, the
‘Cats. should be able to come
up with a potent offense. Join-
ing them in the backfield wilt
