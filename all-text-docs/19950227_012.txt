Past her prime: Joni Mitchell's Turbulent Indigo

By Tom Bavis
Staff writer we

Joni Mitchell's latest al-
bum, Turbulent Indigo, is a highly
respectable but tiring set of songs.
The relatively brief “Sunny Sun-
day” opens the album and reveals
most of its secrets. Over a slow
acoustic groove, a saxophone lets
out an occasional flurry of notes as
Joni begins an vague story of a
lonely woman: “She pulls the
shade, it’s just another sunny Sun-
day / She dodges the light like
Blanche DuBois.” Noticeably
worn from age and cigarettes, her
voice still quivers beautifully

Despite the bright prom-
ise implicit in the title “Sunny Sun-

day,” most songs on Turbulent In-
digo exude a chilling attitude of
intense dread. Ostensibly speak-
ing of the O.J. Simpson case, “Not
to Blame” begins, ‘The story hit

' the news from coast to coast /They
said you beat the girl you loved the_

most.”

“The Sire of Sorrow
(Job’s Sad Song),” the album’s
final track, Serves as a kind of anti-
anthem. Joni reasserts the album’s
heavy-minded themes of death and
suffering while playing a compli-
cated acoustic guitar rhythm. In
the background, an icy keyboard
sound drifts through the song like
awinter breeze. Unlike most sum-
mations, “The Sire of Sorrow” does
little to rouse the listener: “I’ve

lost all taste for life / I’m all com-
plaints.”

Despite the bluntness of
some of the lyrics, Joni cannot hide
the fact that her heart is not into the
music like itused to be. The instru-
mentation recalls but does not cap-
ture the experimental spirit of her
late 70s albums.

Though the lyrics display
undeniable talent and thorough
writing, one can tell they are forced.
In a few songs, “How Do You
Stop” among them, Joni subtly
admits that she knows her best and
most passionate work is behind
her: “One day you’re too young /
Then you’re in your prime / Then
you’ re looking back / At the hands
of time.”

Debut

from page 11

The two men in Heidi's life,
Scoop and Peter, were played by
freshmen Benjamin Summers and
Ben Lukey, respectively. Sum-
mers, who was so radiant in The
Learned Ladies, grew a beard and
lost his radiance, but found a focus
and personality that filled the void.
Lukey joked his way through the
script like an adorable puppy,
searching admirably for some sub-
stance; he never found it, although
he came close. His energy and his
face were the pillars of the ‘Hello,
New York” scene.

Jennifer Neale, playing
Heidi’s friend Susan, created the
most interesting female character.
Early in the play, Susan constantly
talked about changing the system—
she seemed to me a potential revo-
lutionary. Yet, she accepted jobs
within the “male power structure,”

. Saying that once inside, she would

change the system. She did not, of

course, and after separating her-
self from society for-a time, came
to revel in the system she used to
abhor. Neale played Susan hon-
estly—as a woman who really
didn’t know what she was doing,
what she believed in, or who her
friends were.

The supporting cast was ex-
ceptionally strong. As Fran, a foul-
mouthed militant lesbian, Sarah
Hankins was "f—ing" great. Car-
rie Van Deest played Lisa, Scoop’s
unfortunate and spurned wife, with
sweet naivete, but with an edge
that made you suspect how wise
she really was. Sarah Zogby was
sexy and idealistic as Denise, al-
though no one could ever believe
Zogby and Van Deest were sisters.
Kay Walraven hammed it up ef-
fectively as Jill, a women’s sup-
port group member, and Valerie
Whitlock brought her nervous
grace to two substantial roles.
Another standout was Laura Seib
who, with her saccharine flirta-
tions and bubbly voice, added to
the humor of the “Hello, New

York” scene.

If I were to complain about
anything in The Heidi Chronicles,
it would be its inaccessibility.
Wasserstein won a Pulitzer for her
handling of late-80s angst among
American adults, especially
women, andnowsome of the play’s
themes are outdated. This is al-
most the late 90s, and we have a
whole new set of problems.

However, the play contains a
great deal that is. universal. The
script teaches that “‘all people de-
serve to fulfill their potential,” and
that, as Scoop points out, “We are
all awaiting the rebirth of won-
der.” It is Scoop, in fact, who
discovers what this play is really
about. At his wedding, he tells
Heidi that when you aim for a six
and get a six, you can be secure.
By the end of the play, he has
changed, as they all have, and he
says, “If you aim for a six and get
a six, then that’s the ball game, so
you might as well go foraten.” By
the look on Heidi’s face, you know
she agrees.

avoids being preachy or conde-
scending. It is not meant to be a
social critique. The goals of the
film are much broader than that.
Director Steve James breathes new
life into the old “follow your
dreams” cliche. Hoop Dreams
carries an unexpected and univer-
sal appeal.

I found myself both frustrated
and amazed by William Gates and
Arthur Agee. In short, they are
human. But I guess that’s why
documentaries are not always ar-
tistically pleasing; real peopledon’t
always make sense. I started won-
dering what my life would look

like if someone made a documen-

tary about it. Would people be
able to sit through three hours of it?
I don’t know. But by chronicling
the lives of two ordinary boys

grasping for greatness, Steve James
reminds us that life, every life, is
worth paying attention to.
William puts it this way: “Ev-
erybody always said, ‘Don’t for-
get about me when you get to the
NBA.” And I said, ‘But if I don’t
make it to the NBA, are you going

to forget about me?’” It is in the
midst of the everyday dreariness
of two kids, in the place where
failure and hope intersect, that
Hoop Dreams reveals a little of the
mystery of what it means to be
human, of what it means to be
remembered.
