Progress Report On Campus Issues

By RICH WILSON
Editor-in-Chief

The purpose of the following
progress report is to present
the latest developments in the
major issues of current interest
on campus. As of today this is
where we stand on campus is-
sues.

COEDUCATION

College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. has said that he will
make a recommendation on the
issue of coeducation to the trus-
tees this May. The president
says he wants the issue settled
this year.

The trustees had previously
committed the college to the
principle of coeducation. They
said the college would go coed
when it was ‘educationally and
financially feasible.”

At the beginning of this year
the president directed the Edu-
cational Policy Committee and
the Budget, Buildings and
Grounds Committee to deter-
mine the feasibility of coeduca-
tion.

The EPC has polled the facul-
ty, students and alumni and has
inquired at other colleges that
have recently gone coed as to
how their phasing program was
conducted.

The EPC report, which is
scheduled to be completed in
mid-February, will suggest sev
eral alternatives to phasing
plans.

At the same time the Budget
Building and Grounds Commit-
tee will submit cost estimates
for the different alternatives.

These plans will then go be-
fore the faculty who will make
the final recommendation on
which plan they feel is academ-
ically and financially feasible.

The president will then take

in May for the final decision.
COMPREHENSIVE FEE

The final decision on the com
prehensive fee will be made by
Vice President for Academic
Affairs John M. Bevan and by
Vice President for Finance and
Development C. David Cornell.

Bevan met with student gov-
ernment leaders Wednesday
where he was given a list of
questions which students feel
need to be answered.

The two vice presidents have
received a report from the Stu-
dent Life Committee which pro-
tested the fee.

They alsc were asked to abol-
ish the board portion of the fee

by the Patterson Court Coun-
cil.

The President said he will af-
firm any decision made by his
vice presidents.

SUBSIDIZED ATHLETICS

The president has stated that
Davidson will continue to sub-
sidize athletics until the college
can determine whether the Wild-
cat Fund can raise sufficient
funds to continue the present
football program.

In the year ending Dec. 31.
the Wildcat Fund raised $150,
000. But in the fiscal year end-
ing last June 30, $265,000 was re-
quired to maintain the football
program, according to Cornell.

Since $150,000 ha 000 has already

been raised for next year by
the Wildcat Fund, the college is
now in the process of determin-
ing how much it will subsidize.

Cornell said he is anxiously
awaiting the Student Govern-
ment poll on subsidized foot-
ball, since he believes that stu-
dent opinion may be an_ influ-
ential factor in the amount the
college will subsidize football in
next year’s budget.

TUITION AND FEES

The college begins investiga
tions for next year’s budget on
Monday so that the final budget
proposal will be completed in
February to take to the Trus-
tees in May.

Although Cornell _ would not

predict the increase, he did
comment that college income
in this year’s budget is down
by over $50,000. Cornell said this
was because of loss of tuiticn.
“‘Many students are away from
the campus on special programs
that we didn’t plan for last
year,” he said.

Unless this money can be sup-
plied or expenditures cut, the
college could show a deficit by
the end of the year.

During the past two weeks a

that we cannot conscientiously

for example. As Fabert put it.
“We're not trying to mess any
thing up.”

The petition is aimed at the
Admissions Office which the
group feels is particularly vol-
nerable since it admittedly
places great importance upon
the recuruiting of .prospects by
present students.

“White knows better than any-
one else the consequences of
our discouraging — prospective
students,”’ said Scarritt.

White, however, while ac-
knowledging the weight of the
petition, feels he is not in a
position to influence any change.

“It's a threat ves, but it’s a
threat over which I have no
control,’ said White. “It’s a de-

cision the trustees have to
make. [ll definitely pass on the
information though. I think
that in one form or another the
trustees will hear about it.”
White also feels that his posi
tion does not allow him to take
an active stand on the issue.
“As long as I am representing
a men's institution I have to
believe in it.”’ White said.
“The day the trustees change
it, then Ill be representing a
different kind of institution. If
it’s a coed institution then I'll
be selling a coed institution.”
Though the originators of the
petition are very optimistic
about its chances for success.
DAVIDSONTAN poll of approxi
mately 100 freshman showed
opinion is divided. A slight ma
jority feel that the petition
would have little effect upon
the administration's thinking.
The orginators of the peti-
tion, however, dismiss this as
pessimism. “‘This is not like
other petitions,” Scarritt stress-
ed. “The strong support of this
statement make it carry a lot
of weight.” The group’ also
hinted that, should this petition
fail to get the attention they
think it deserves, they have a
more drastic action planned;
however, all three declined to
be more specific.

application of school rules and
policy of the Board of Trustees.

To back up his protest, Eades
cited a passage in the Trustees
Statement on Social System Po
licy stating ©. . . the Board
affirms the responsibility of the
college to serve the welfare and
interests of all students.”

Fades said the 259 signa-
tures on the petition was evi-
dence that the board part of the
fee is not felt by the students
to be in their interest.

Semi-legal opposition to the
board program was pointed up
in a part of the Committee of
Fighteen report which asserts
that. “The college shall not
serve as a_ collection agency
but shall aid in collection should

payment be outstanding beyond
a certain time or above a cer
tain amount.”

Eades stated his interpreta-
tion of these passages. “They
(the College) will receive stu
dent’s money and transfer it to
the house at which he’s eating:
and that’s a collection agency.

“We're asking the college
which rules they’re upholding,”
he said. “Of course they have
the right to change the rules,
but the Conimittee of Eighteen
Report was hashed out and was
believed to be the ‘rules for
the social system. They've
changed their mind without con
sulting students or faculty about
it.”
