said in the September 8 issue, “T
don’t like the idea. I think [the
post office] is an important link
between the students and the

Bill Clinton and his Propaganda

Whoo... we’re back in the
saddle again. “Week after week we

| pull the ‘ole horse out of the barn,

dust her off, and ride her down to
the ‘ole Davidsonian office to
round us up another column. It
ain’t easy bein’ the only cowpokes
on the range whose outlook on life
is somewhere to the right of Bill
Clinton’s. In fact, the townsfolk
get downright ornery when we
point out what they’re steppin’ in
when they amble through the half-
truths and outright lies that “Slick
Willie” leaves in his wake. Makes
us feel like we’ ve been rode hard
and put up wet.

Did ya’ll know (enough of
this affected “Western” motif) that
Bill Clinton, in the course of his
infamous “gubernatorial years,”
had the gall, the audacity, yea...
the hubris to personally raise the
taxes of the good people of Arkan-
sas ONE HUNDRED AND
TWENTY SEVEN TIMES! No,
we kid you not. But before you’ze
Democrats get your teamsters in
an uproar (quick, what do you call

.ateamster in a suit? Answer: the

defendant), we should tell you that
this bit of triviacame straight from
Little Rock.

Now, George Stephanopoulos
(Clinton’s chief propagandist) did
pause for a moment from scaring
the old people about Bush’s un-
wholesome intentions toward their
S. S. checks to reply to this appar-
ent scandal. “What the Republi-
cans did is jerry-rig . .. a bunch of
phony tax increases.” ‘Not so, Mr.
Dukakanopoulus. In fact, the Re-
publican party was merely fulfill-
ing its civic responsibility to bring
to the fore any facts pertinent tothe
selection of a Presidential candi-
date.

While it is true that the initial

Dr. Sutton, let me praise you
for your research. Those facts and
figures were mighty impressive,
butI’mafraid you missed my point.
Let me quote the article to try to
explain my point, “By the defini-
tion above, tokenism is practiced
at Davidson College. The College
appears to be answering the
problems of African-American
students, when in all actuality
they are not.” My point was to
draw attention to what I perceive
as a poor job of dealing with mi-
nority affairs by Davidson Col-
lege. The problems that I talked
about were the low number of Af-
rican-American students, lack of
appealing social activities, and the
small number of African-Ameri-
can related courses and professors.

The only mention of the Ad-
missions Department came at the
end when I suggested that Davidson
re-evaluate its admission standards.
My class’ SAT average was about
1220, which is pretty high. I under-
stand thatcolleges suchas Oberlin,
Amherst, and Swarthmore allcom-

pete with Davidson for the Afri-
can-American students who meet
these high standards. So, I was

Dr. Sutton, I suggest you re-read
my article so that you can under-

extremely disturbed by your un-
professional comments such as,
“[T]o suggest that we keep out
black applicants who should be
admitted so that we may practice
tokenism is ludicrous.” I will not
even stoop to this level to respond,

stand what I really said.

I’m sorry, let me move on to
this week's topic. This week, I want
to talk about the Union Outpost.
Whose idea was this anyway? The
Union Outpost sucks. Take a look
at the menu and see the plethora of

list was compiled by Republicans,
probably as a cynical means of
drumming up votes, its much more
than that now. Its THE TRUTH .
. .something of which Democrats
are especially wary. According to
the Arkansas Department of Fi-
nance and Administration (a state
agency under Clinton’s direction)
34 tax increases and 93 user fee
increases were recorded during
Clinton’s tenure.

~ Of course, we should remind
you that Bush accused Clinton of
raising taxes 128 times. So, the
Clinton list has one less revenue
increase than the Bush list. The
last one will probably be enacted
the day after Clinton takes office.
This one’s a biggie. According to
White House sources, it could total
ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY
BILLION DOLLARS !!! No sur-
prise then, that Bill Clinton
alledgedly declared “we [must] ...
. raiseand spend.” (OK, itsslightly
out of context).

According to Washington Post
columnists Dan Balz and Ruth
Marcus, in the course of aone hour
session, “Clinton pledged to spend
more money on: education, job
training, housing, transportation,
elderly Americans, commercial
research and development, college
aid, Head Start, AIDS research and
education, women’s health prob-

promises you know what’s really
on his mind. Say hello to tax and
spend ladies and gentleman and
it’s coming to a suburb near you.
He’ salready raised taxes 127 times
back in Podunk, USA. Do you
think Clinton would balk at goug-
ing the middle class as a means of
delivering the impossibly expen-
sive promises all Democrats in-
tone on’ the road to the White
House?

Each and every item on Slick
Willie’s wish list is noble, good
and true. But the last time we
checked, the debt was pushing four
trillion ‘and the prospects of even
making a dent in the 300-400 bil-
lion ‘93-’94 deficit are pretty slim
indeed. Assuming Clinton elimi-
nates the ENTIRE defense appro-
priation (and he probably will),
that’s still only 200 billion to play
around with. So, we’re still in the
hole and the Canadians could in-
vade us. Who needs that?

Itis asevident to us as it should
be to you that the numbers don’t
add up. Someone who has repeat-
edly raised taxes in his own state
(one wonders if the Arkansans can
still buy food since Clinton raised
the sales tax) cannot be allowed to
hedge on this critical issue. Before
you hold Bush’s broken campaign
pledge over his head like ‘some
sword of Damocles, consider

lems and community policing.", , Iq £3 <who?s more.Jikel to stick it to,you

addition, he promised the Ameri. -
can Legion “virtually everything
they cared about, from hospital
beds to protection of the flag.” No
wonder Tsongas called him Pan-
der Bear. .

Atleast Fritz Mondale had the
courage to tell us he’d raise taxes.
Sure, Clinton said he’d only raise
taxes on the wealthiest two percent
of the population, but with all these

food choices: an omelette, a pizza,
two kinds of sandwiches, a bagel,
yogurt, OJ, milk, V-8, coffee, tea,
and a 2 oz. bag (actually 10z.) of
potato chips.

__ The Outpost doesn’t have any
of the popular Cafe items such as:
grilledcheese sandwiches, chicken
filets, mac & cheese, burritos, chips
& salsa, candy, and many others.
As if that weren’t bad enough, you
can only buy a soft drink out of a
machine. You can’t buy Gatorade
or the many fruit drinks that are
offered by the Cafe.

But the menu is not the only
reason the Union Outpost is a ter-
rible idea. When the Outpost is
open, the Union Cafe closes. That
means that the Cafe closes at 11
P..M.on Wednesday, Thursday and
at 8 P.M. on Friday, Saturday.

Picture this. You are in the
library studying on Wednesday,
and you suddenly get a craving for
your favorite flavor of Ben & Jerry
ice cream. In the good old days,
you could run to the Union, eat
your ice cream, and be back in the

Davidsonians, that four years from
now, mom and dad won’t be pay-
ing your bills.

there’s still time (besides, Hillary’s

tive; isn’t Mrs. Bush nice?)

library in fifteen minutes. Unfor-
tunately, those days are gone. Your
only option is to go to the Outpost
and eat something you probably
don’t want like a $5.00 pizza. This
fiasco should take you between
30-45 minutes.

I think I speak for the majority
of the students whenI say the Union
Outpost is a flop. I know that the
idea looked really good on the
drawing board, but as my RA put
it, “[Y]ou’re screwed if you are in
the library.” William Brown, I’m
begging you, give us ,back our
chicken filets and burritos.
