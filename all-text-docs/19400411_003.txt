Blazer Choice
Is Postponed
To Next Year

At the last meeting of the com-
mittee on Junior Class Blazers, it
was decided that the selection and
purchase of Blazers would be post-
poned until next year, since the
members of the class were not sat~
isfied with the blazer samples on
hand.

Samples for the blazers were ob-
tained from several clothing stores
and tailoring companies. These were
on display at the student store and
the balloting was held there.

The class voted by a large major-
ity recently to get the blazers this
year so that they would be of more
service. Had they gotten them, it
would have been the first time that
the blazers had been obtained un}
till after the Christmas holidays of
their senior year.

Members of the committee in
charge af getting the blazers were
John Purdie, Joe Shelton, and Bob
Reinhardt.
