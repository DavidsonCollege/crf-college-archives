FORD GRANT

$1 Million Mark Passed

The Davidson College Ford
Challenge Program has now re-
ceived over one million dollars
in advance gifts, according to
President D. Grier Martin.

As of Dec. 24, $1,001,300 in
gifts had been tabulated in the
$7.7 million drive. General soli-
citation is scheduled to begin in
January.

The campaign still needs to
solicit approximately $4.5 mil-
dion more by June, 1968, in order
to qualify for the $2.2 million
grant.

However, national co-chairmen
Walter L. Lingle Jr. of Cincin-
nati, Ohio, and Willlam A. White
Jr. of Charlotte are confident
that the campaign is on sched-
ule.

In a joint statement the co-
chairmen emphasized the neces-
sity of passing the $2 million
mark by June 30 of this year in
order to qualify for the first
$800.000 payment of the Ford
grant.

“This million dollar announce-
ment is encouraging,” White
stated, ‘‘since it indicates the

“We knew we had to raise a
minimum of approximately a
million dollars every six months
for the. three-year period, and

job can be done,” White continu-
ed.

The challenge drive will pro-
gress in the new year with a
reglon-by-region canvass of sixty
cities where sizable groups of
Davidson alumni, parents and
friends live.

Computerized Dating
Outcome Questioned

Earlier this year, many Davidson students took part
in a program known as Operation Match designed to
find, by computer, compatible couples among the stu-
dents of area colleges.

Some of these applicants were freshmen, suddenly
finding themselves at a loss for female companionship,
after having been treated well by “Cupid the Computer’

Over the Christmas vacation
part of the library staff with
the help of certain faculty mem-
bers’ older children moved over
105,000 books to these new loca-
tions:

The 000's, 100’s, 200’s and 300’s
(to 1830) are now on the second
floor of the main building, be-
ginning at the north end.

The 300’s (1830 on) are on
the second floor of the Babcock

during the early mixers.

Others were upperclassmen, tired of dating the

same old girls from Queens.

Whatever the reason, all the applicants had to com-

plete a five-page form, with
color of the applicant’s eyes

questions ranging from the

to whether or not they con-

sidered themselves ‘sexually experienced”.
Then, dreaming of the “beautiful, warm, sensitive

girl” promised by
forms (along with

the advertisements, they mailed their
three dollars) and sat back to wait ...

and wait... and wait... and wait.

Finally,
months late,

when the long-awaited replies arrived, two
these forms contained a list of supposedly

compatible girls, along with a warning what the results
were “not guaranteed,” and to take “normal precautions”

before dating one of the listed matches.

These lists

varied from a minimum of five to 10 and more for the

suave, debonair types.

Many applicants.soon arrived at the conclusion that
almost any girl worth dating could find a date without

the aid of an IBM.

Some girls took the initiative and wrote to the boys
whose addresses they received. Many are still waiting

for a reply, especially those who enclosed pictures.

One freshman complained that he was unable to read
a letter he received, and that the few words he could

make out were misspelled.

Another said that a girl who sent her picture looked

like a “refuge from a z00.”

Surely, some intelligent, likeable, good-looking girls
participated in Operation Match, one applicant conjec-
tured, but unfortunately, none of them have turned up

yet.

As always in a project of this size, mistakes were
made. Names were misspelled, and addresses and phone

numbers were left out.

There were even cases of boys getting the names
of other boys. (At least. the boys claimed it was a mis-
take. Only the computer knows for sure.)

It is still too early for any definite conclusions about

Operation Match.

will be remains to be seen, but the outlook is questionable.

Christian Commitment
Questioned By Rector

The form of Davidson’s com-
mitment to the Church must be
drastically altered to make both
the educational and Christian
experience more meaningful.
William Morris, rector at St.
Alban’s Episcopal Church, told
an unusually attentive student
body yesterday.

“I'm glad Davidson has a
Christian commitment,” Morris
explained, ‘‘but the form it takes
must change.”

The priest explained that while
the commitment should remain,
the form must constantly under:
go modification and revision. He
likened the present form to a
sacred cow: “A sacred cow is
immune; it can trample through
your garden and defecate on
your lawn and you can't say

anything about it.”
‘The same situation exists

here at Davidson: Davidson has
its present form because it has
its present form.”

The church is not infallible,
the priest said, and to assert
that it is alienates more people
than it commends to it. ‘‘I’m a
Christian and this bothers me,”
he said.

Faith includes the freedom
not to believe. Morris asserted.
God can’t be predicted, and one
can’t say that pagans don’t
know God,

Students did not escape blame
for the present situation. Morris
believes that in acquiesing, stu-
dents are saying they are will-
ing to accept a less-than-satis-
factory undergraduate educa-
tion.

“The student body will gripe
and bitch because it's expected

interested,” the priest told the
surprised student body.

Morris’ idea of a college's pur-
pose is education, and he be-
lieves the best education can be
best prescribed by the entire
academic community rather
than by the Church alone.

“A Christian liberal arts col-
lege should be no different from
any other liberal arts college,”
he said.

To bring this about, Morris
wants the Church to surrender
some of its favored place on
campus and become a more
basic part of college life.

“The church should not be in-
discussable: it should come
down from its pedesta] and enter
into the real give-and-take.”

The reason for a reticence in
liberating the church, he thinks,

Christianity would die.

“Sure, 80 per cent of you],

would stop going to church, but
it would be pleasant for every-
one to stop being hypocrites,” he
quipped in his typically dry de-

The nature of God is such, he
ventured, that one either meets
him everywhere or nowhere, but
never in just the religious ex-
ercises. God can't be confined
to religious purposes,

“We meet him everywhere.

ent building will be useful for
about five more years.”

Davidson pointed out that this
building could be used for up to
seven more years if every inch
of shelf space were used, but
he termed this undesirable.

He noted that for the past two
years the library budget for new
books has been about $78,000 per
year as compared to $38,000 per
year previously.

Regarding the prospects for a
new library, Davidson pointed
out his office window to the
sloping hill on the other side of
Concord Street.

He envisioned a handsome ro-
tunda front (a la University of
Virginia) to a windowless build-

GEORGE WILLIAMS

Clark, Williams Win
Major Scholarships

Two Davidson students, Billy
Clark and George Williams, re-
cently won two of the most high-
ly - sought - after scholarship
awards for graduate study that
are given in the United States.

Clark became Davidson’s 15th
Rhodes Scholar, and Williams
became its second Marshall
Scholar. This is the first year
that Davidson has had both a
Rhodes and a Marshall scholar.

Davidson ranks eighth among
liberal arts colleges in America
in the number of its graduates
who have received Rhodes Schol-
arships. Davidson's last Rhodes
Scholar was Danny Carrell in
1963.

In the past Secretary of State
Dean Rusk (class of ‘31) and
James McDowell Richards
(class of °22), current president
of the Board of Trustees, were
Rhodes Scholars.

Thirty-two young men from
the U. S., representing 28 states
and 22 colleges and universities,
have been selected for Rhodes
Scholarships to attend Oxford
University in England beginning
next fall.

The scholars-elect look for-
ward to two (in special cases,
three) years of study at Oxford
in any field and a stipend of
about $2,500.

All candidates must be male,
unmarried citizens of the U. S.,
with at least five years domicile,
and can range from 18 to 24
years of age. They must be at
least juniors in college.

Each year 24 Marshall Schol-
arships are granted to outstand-
ing American university stu-
dents, enabling them to study at
any British university for two
(or sometimes three) years.

Unlike the Rhodes Scholar-
ships, students may be of either
sex and may be married.

Selections and_ eliminations
are made by committees inter-
viewing the students in various
parts of the country. The first
stage of selection always takes
place at the college or university
a candidate represents.

According to the Rhodes
Foundation itself, ‘Quality of
both character and intellect is
the most important requirement

for a Rhodes Scholarship.”
