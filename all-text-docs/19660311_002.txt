A Breath Of Fresh Air

The appearance of Mr. Alexander
Gabrie! in Tuesday's assembly was like
a breath of fresh air in what has gen-
erally been a barren year for chapel
speakers.

The spectacle of an entertaining,
vet well informed. speaker has come
to be an unexpected treat in the three-
times-a-week fare of assemblies.

An aside made during the course of
his talk suggested to us an entirely dif-
ferent significance from what he in-
tended. yet it seemed somehow appro-
priate that he should make the com-
ment.

We refer to Mr. Gabriel’s suggestion
of the prospect of his picketing in
front of Chambers for a more sub-
stantial honorarium for his speaking
engagement.

While the journalist’s comment was
undoubtedly spoken in jest, at least
for the most part, we suggest that
drastic action may be warranted,
should it provide us with more speak-
ers of Mr. Gabriel’s caliber.

The amount provided for the usual
chapel speakers is piteously low, and
consequently the possibility of hear-
ing outstanding speakers is ordinarily
limited to such channels as the Reyn-
olds Lectureship or chance contacts of
members of the college community
with scattered speakers of extraordi-
nary ability.

Complaints against required assem-
blies are so often heard that they are
rarely taken seriously anymore. But
we suspect that the ordinary student's
objection is not so much to the re-
quired exercises in themselves, but in
being subjected to dull and uninterest-
ing speakers who just happened to be
available.

If funds are not available to sup-
plement the existing appropriation for
assembly speakers, the next best step
for improving the gituation would be
to reduce the number of assemblies
and offer a smaller number of ‘out-
standing speakers.

Is not one Mr. Gabriel worth 10
mediocre speakers?

Critic Applauds Success
Of ‘The Glass Menagerie’

By HANSFORD M. EPES
A Review

When Tennessee Williams’
The Glass Menagerie opened jn
New York in 1945, the critic
Ward Morehouse said that it was
“fragile and poignant .. . a cur-
iously enchanting play.”

Twenty-one years later, the
play has lost none of its charm.
It is still enchanting. still poig-
nant—and still fragile. It takes
careful handling.

And Thursday night—or during
the many weeks that it takes to
bring about a Thursday night—
it had that handling. from an
exceptionally fine cast. a good
production staff, and. at the

heart of it all. the director,
Mr. Barber.
Glass Menagerie’s nature

might be suggested by the title
of a song heard briefly in the
background music: ‘Street of
Dreams’'—for this ‘‘memory
play” is itself a dream, about
Laura, whose world is inhabited
by delicate glass animals: about
her mother, Amanda; and broth-
er, Tom—whose glass menag
‘eries of an idealized past and
a movie house present are of
no more substance. and no less
reality, than is Laura’s fragile
collection.

Their world is entered by Jim,
a Gentleman Caller, who is for
Tom a gift to his family: for
Amanda, a remembrance of
things past: and for Laura, an
old dream which becomes real—

and shatters.

Tom is, of course, the author
of the dream. His mixed emo-
tions concerning his family were
well portrayed by Bill Wiseman,
who managed the difficult task
of maintaining in proper balance
measures of sardonic distance
and genuine and gentle affection.
Laura, whose fragility is dif-
ficult. to play. convincingly with-
‘out giving the impression of
blandness, did not come through
in Mary Martin's portrayal as
a really developed character—
but one wonders if this fault
does not lie partially in the
drama itself. Jim. the Gentle-
man Caller (Walter Drake), is
a somewhat gauche and often
humorous “ordinary young
man.” As such, it is easy for the
actor and director establishing
his character to let it degenerate
into a slapstick portrayal: this
was the case during most of the
second act. Little touches such
as one bit of added comic “‘busi-
ness"’ just before Jim begins to
talk to Laura starts him off with
the wrong tone. The result was
often to let gentle humor degen-
erate into farce—a major flaw
in a scene where the transitions
between humor and poignancy
are so frequent and rapid.

The star of the evening,
though. was Ethel Rhodes as
Amanda. Although Amanda's
silliness came through. not as
often as it perhaps should, the
character was developed with a
warmth and understanding
which is vital. The lines she
speaks show her faults: Mrs.

Rhodes’ acting showed the en-
dearing qualities which underlie
them.

The author's notes for the
drama indicate the importance
which he places on production,
always an important factor in
conveying the mood of a drama.
The lighting (John Liipfert and
Harry Blakeslee) is particularly
worth mentioning. This difficult
job was done.almost flawlessly.
Robert Williams’ set was, for the
most part, attractive and effec-
tive, though the tendency to-
ward boxiness was a little annoy-
ing particularly so with the spec-
tacle of that incredible op-art
back wall, which some architect
inflicted on the stage, peering
over the top of the apartment.
Farther, a play such as this calls
for a much greater use of the
Stage area toward the audience
than there was: and the color
of the archway curtains. given
the effectively bland colors of
tne costumes and set dressings,
was less than fortuitous. The
sound track (from the original
production) contributed a great
deal, but was once or twice too
loud.

This is quibbling. however. It's
a good play; it’s well done. It
should show that a college au-
dience doesn’t really need such
trivial diversions as Green Grow
the Lilacs in its unfortunately
limited drama program: good
drama is also entertaining. The
Glass Menagerie will play again
at 8:15 on Tuesday and Wednes-
day. It's well worth seeing.
Don‘t miss it.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Smith Objects To Policy
Of Requiring Worship

Dear President Martin:

I am looking forward to your
discussing the college’s Vespers
policy with students on Open
End next week. With the hope
that the discussion then will con-
cern creative suggestions, may I
try to summarize here some of
the negative and critical ideas
which many of us have about
compulsory church attendance.

In my mind, there are two
basic reasons for disagreeing
with the Vespers policy. The first
concerns the {dea of the whole
thing. To require one to worship
is impossible. Worship must by
its nature be free: the idea of
required worship is self-contra-
dictory.

Of course the college recog-
nizes this. and would not try to
require students to worship. In-
Stead. the college merely re-
quires attendance. The purpose
of this must have something to
do with the hope that association
with a worship service will do
students some good, This lends
to.the second major objection to
Vespers.

In practice. they do not pro-
duce the ‘benefits which it is
hoped they would. Perhaps at a
different school in a different
society at a different time. forc-
ed. association with worship
could. have had some good ef-
fects on students.

But for psychological. social.
liturgical. and many other rea-
sons with which you are well
familiar. it does not do so at
Davidson at the present. I think
it. is a fact that. practicallv
speaking, the effect of required
Vespers on students is over-
whelming bad — both for them-
selves and for the church.

Although Vespers is intended
to help the church. it actually
harms it, due to the intense re-
action of students against a
church which uses these techni-
ques to maintain its position. In
the end. the Vespers policy
forces a large portion of the stu-
dent body to act hypocritically.
as though they had beliefs which
they do not have, or about which
they are in doubt.

These two objections to Ves-
pers. an ideal one and a practi-

cal one, must.be obvious tp the -

college. Therefore. the college
must have reasons ‘for its Ves-
pers policy. -

For example, Vespers requires
students to be back on campus
by Sunday evening. so that we
don't .overextend ourselves on
weekends. The assumption of.
this argument is that students
cannot be responsible, if given
freedom.

"In light of our mature response

to the broadening of the class
cut policy several years ago and
to the recent repeal of the stu
dent prohibition on drinking, this
assumption is false. Moreover.
it contradicts Davidson's goals
of a Free Christian College.
There are much better reasons
for the Vespers policy than those

given above. One is that the col-
lege cannot afford to antagonize
potential donors during the Ford
Challenge’ Campaign. Another is
that the college is not willing to
act contrary to the wishes of the
Church which founded it. and
especially the Trustees which
govern it.

As I mentioned above, by act-
ing according to the Church's
wishes, the college is acting
against the Church’s interest.
Like the Church, the donors and
the trustees are. using their
money and votes to enforce a
policy which they think is good
for students, good for the
Church, and in accordance with
their personal ideas about re-
ligion and education.

I am. convinced, however, both
that this policy is bad for all con-
cerned. and that the mental and
spiritual welfare of students
should be the one factor above
all others which determines col-
lege policy. I sincerely hope that
the college will have the wisdom
and determination to defy in-
terests which‘run counter to the
free and responsible education of
the students.

Freedom concerning worship.
and freedom to behave accord-
ing to the best that one thinks
and believes concerning religion.
are essential to the existence of
a Free Christian College.

Dear Editor:

With this letter I hope to clear
up what is a very hazy, if not
inaccurate, picture painted by
your article on married-student
housing (your article ‘‘Couples
Live in Village Huts," Friday,
Feb. 25, 1966).

For my purpose it is entirely
irrelevant whether I gave this
impression to the interviewer or
the ‘interviewer, wanted a story
of this. tone and picked carefully

from what I said to suit his pur--

poses. I do not wish to pin blame
on anyone but merely wish to
‘point out that there is definitely
another side to the story:

From a very practical angle I
might point. out that all four of
the married students who rent
‘in Jackson Heights chose this
location over the ‘nicer’? apart-
ments .in-town. Why? First. the
rent here js only, $35.00 a month
($40.00 with college furniture.)
Compare this with other schools.

Secondly, speaking for myself,
I chose to have my own four
walls and front and back doors
opening onto a yard rather than
having apartment ‘which
shares the main entrance with
another family. ;

As to the physical condition of
these houses there are certainly
“cold weather’ problems and
room for the school to make im-
provements, but these conditions
do not warrant the slum-like im-

an

plications (enhanced by the ac-
companying picture of the arti-
cle. I dare say that more than a

few of the grand old houses on , yg.

North Main Street run into simi-
lar troubles.

Also the language used in the
article indirectly indicts the col-
lege maintenance department,
implying negligence. Several
times this year all four of us
have had something needing at-
tention and have received
prompt service.

I might cite the Sunday of our
snow and near-zero weather
when Mr. Luther Honeycutt, in
charge of the maintenance de-
partment crawled under the
house to thaw our frozen water
pipes.

Tt is also my opinion that the
houses can be made into pleas.
ant as well as comfortable
homes just as they are. The col-
lege paints the exterior every
few years, and furnished paint
by the college, the Students often
‘paint the interior. In fact three
of us completely repainted the
interiors this past fall.

Regardless of what can be
said for or against the houses in
Jackson Heights, each one of us
is pleased With living here. What
else can be important!

Dear Editor:

Concerning the recent article
on Freshman Camp, I would
like to offer a brief clarification.

There are four salient reasons
that produced an excess of funds
this year. First, an increase
from 100 to 160 freshman attend-
ing camp. Secondly, the Fresh-
man Camp staff's handling of
the eating arrangements when
Slater was unable to cater to the
camp as it had in the past.

Thirdly, Slater helpfully
bought all of the broken-lot food
left over from Freshman Camp.
Fourthly, the fact that we were
charged nothing for the camp;
although we sent the camp a
check charging ourselves a dol-
lar per day per person in an ef-
fort to insure our use of Camp
Thunderbird.

The Freshman Camp Funds
have always been kept by the
business manager in a separate
account from the regular Y
funds. Deducting unpaid Nabili-
ties the Camp has an excess this
year of $913.86. ;

Due to the amount of the sur-
plus and the suecess of this
year’s Y fund drive this excess
will not be placed in the general
Y Tund, but kept in a separate
Freshman Camp account. With
this excess to falt back on the
rate for next year's Freshman
Camp will be reduced and the
savings will be passed on to the
class of 1970.

‘Death Of God' Movement

Raises Modern Questions

A recent movement in theolo-
gy. the Death of God movement,
has caused a good deal of con-
troversy among both laity and
clergy. Ministers hotly blast
these new ‘‘atheists."' The pious
cringe at their bold irreverence.
How could anyone question the
existence of the quiet Nazarene,
the Lord and Saviour.

How they ask, but they make
deaf their ears, make blind their
eyes and minds, when spokes-
men of this movement try to ex-
plain their radical thinking.
Their emotionally weighed re-
actions deny any real. creative
interaction with the ideas pre-
sented.

Further complications plague
this debate in the person of its
major spokesman, Thomas J. J.
Altizer. He shrouds his visions in
the language of the mystic. De-
spite these two difficulties, I
feel unable to light the first fag
got or to turn my back on the
whole issue as insignificant.

I feel that it is important to
attempt what I fecl is an honest
presentation of part of this
movement's thought as found in
Altizer. Altizer asserts, ‘‘A theo-
logy which continues to proclaim
the reality of God is closed to the
contemporary reality of the in-
carnation.” Theology was once
a carefully designed structure
with secure foundations. But
now, Altizer affirms, this struc-
ture has lost its traditional

ground and has retained only the
possibility of speaking meaning-
fully: then, only when it speaks
against its own historical ident-
ity.

The problem for theology to-
day is one of “overcoming the
root’ impediments of speech it-
self,’ rather that of speaking
meaningfully or relevantly. Once
theology reflected the thinking
response of man to the incarnate

‘Word. But now this Word is sil-

ent!

To proclaim the reality of God
to our day can only be to echo
a past revelation. For -Altizer,
this secondary contact is in-
valid. Valid theology can not lie
in the past, for as William
Blake’s poem ‘‘America™’ indi-
cates, modern man is isolated
from the past, cut off from the
bonds of traditions.

Only as theology speaks of the
‘actual now to which the Christ-
jan Word is directed’’ can theo-
logy be meaningful. But now this
Word is Silent!

The Word is silent, Altizer
states, because man has arrived
at the point where he has realiz-
ed the Death of God. Man finds
it no longer meaningful to be-
lieve in the existence of God be-
cause such is irrelevant to the
problems of teday: he finds it
no longer possible to believe in
the existence of God because
the modern scientific world view
has brought supernaturalism in-
to disrepute; and he finds it no

longer necessary to believe in
the existence of God because the
mysteries of the universe cease
to baffle him.

It is only now, in our times,
that we come to understand what
happened 2000 years ago. The
transcendent God descended to
become immanent in the person
of Jesus Christ. Here Altizer's
mysticism eludes us. He asserts
that man killed God. He is dead!
He affirms this on the one hand
and maintains an optimism on
the other.

It appears to me that Altizer
is using hyperbole, overstate-
ment. I feel that he means by
these affirmations that man is
incapable of having personal en-
counter with the divine in his
immediate circumstance.

Further, Altizer hopes that out
of an honest, open recognition
of our despair, we might emerge
to a new vision of the incarnate
Word, Christ. The apparent con-
traditions between Christ’s death
and sudden reappearance con-
titutes the major difficulty in at-
tempting to make this theology
consistent. ,

But still we see the questions
raised: modern questions of re-
levance, of meaningful speech,
of real encounter. The value of
raising such questions demands
that each carefully think through
this new movement and the cri-
ticism now raised against it.

ARE PROFESSIONAL ATHLETIC TEAMS con-

sistent with the purposes of Davidson College? In
two sports, fpotball and basketball, athletic scholar-

ships with special privileges are given to some 60
men. These special privileges include ability to keep
a car on campus, no grade-point average to keep
such a grant, slightly lowered admissions standards.
This amounts to hiring athletes for four years of
service.

Is this a legitimate use of scholarship funds at a
school with the high reputation of Davidson Col-
lege? Evidently the Visiting Committee of the
Southern Association of Colleges and Schools did
not think so.

» *

“HEY HARRINGTON! Why raise a fuss over
‘paid athletes’? Those men are good guys, aren’t
they? Some of them are your good friends and the
coaches are all right, too.

“The school gets good publicity, alumni give
a wad of bread for winning football and basketball
teams. Why worry whether these guys are really
professionals?”

+ . te

PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES ARE GOOD GUYS.
So are most of the coaches. And bigtime athletic
teams are an integral part of many campuses. And
the question naturally arises, ‘Why not at David-
son also?’

The editor of the student newspaper at Notre
Dame University, Steve Feldhaus, made a few com-
ments that partially answer this question. These
comments were quoted in The Charlotte Observer,
Monday, March 7th issue:

“it is my feeling and that of other
influential students I know here that big-
time athletics perhaps doesn't have a place
in a major university.

“You begin to question the effects of
heavy pressure being put on athletes in an
academic community.

_ “You wonder whether we could func-
tion as an academic community while some
students are spending five or six hours a
day on football.

“But they (sports) should be used to
develop the individual. I feel where there
is too much emphasis on a sport, it is det-
rimental to a person.”

Steve Feldhaus said that this applied
to “any sport where the student is pres-
sured to devote himself exclusively to a
sport and not receive the education he came
to the university for.”

] AGREE, STEVE. And there are other reasons
to oppose big-time athletics, paid athletics at David-
son. Why not professional athletics at. Davidson, the
answer is clear and simple.

Davidson is a small liberal arts college dedicated
to the quest for truth, seeking men of the highest
caliber for its student body. Selecting men and nay-
ing them for their athletic ability, instead of for their
intellectual potential, is inconsistent with the pur-
poses of this college. :

This is an age when more than ever we Ameri-
cans need men of deep and mature intellectual in-
sight and ability. Because this nation is the guardian
of Western values, we Americans have the responsi-
bility to meet the problems of this age. In this coun-
try we look to our colleges and universities to turn

out such men to guide us through what seems to be
a dark future.

_ This is the first and only major task of our
universities. Professional athletic teams are not ger-
mane to educational institutions. Professional athle-

tics belong to the realm of entertainment, not of
education.

* * s

THE VISITING COMMITTEE of the Southern
Association of Colleges and Schools paid a visit to
this campus last Nov. 14-17. Their report touched on
the problem of athletic scholarships and preferential

treatment (admissions) for football and basketball
players. ,

The Visiting Committee Report flatly stated its
agreement on these points; first, that athletic scho-
larships were not in Keeping with the stated purposes
of Davidson College; second, that the Living En-
downment Fund was not a wise source for such
scholarship aid.

Accordingly the Visiting Committee Report re-
commended that athletic scholarships be abolished.

__,,At seven different places in their report, the
Visiting Committee stated their belief that athletic
scholarships and the resulting professional athletic

teams were inconsistent with Davi *s hi -

I AGREE. The time has passed when Davidson
could afford the luxury of professional athletic
teams. The cost is too high; not so much the financial
cost, but the cost in human resources and the cost
to our purpose and our responsibility to this nation.
