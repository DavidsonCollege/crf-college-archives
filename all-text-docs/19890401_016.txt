Student Lawmakers
Study Honor Council

At the meeting of the Student Council Monday
night, discussion centered around the proposed Honor
Council, The. Honor Council Committee recommended
that there be 11 members on the Honor Council. This
would mean that at every trial there would be 9 voting
members, a prosecutor, and a defense.

This Honor Council would
necessarily include some mem-
bers with previous trial experi-
ence. The rising sophomore
class would elect two perma-
nent members who would be on
the council for three years.
Next. year the class would
choose two additional men to
serve for two years. This would
make a total of four men from
the junior class, The following
year one additional member
would be chosen for a total of
five. Distribution of councilmen
according to class would be
sophomore class, 2; Junior class,
4; and senior class, 5.

The Honor Council Commit-
tee recommended that the elec-
tions be held in the following
order: student body officers,
Student Council members, and
Honor Council. Whether the
Student Council elections or the

be held first still remains un-
decided.

Prompted

Jones said that the IFC would
promote “a more constructive
program” for fraternity pre-ini-
ation ceremonies next year. He
expressed approval of widely
popular “Greek Week” festivi-
ties or a Help Week similar
to that sponsored by Alpha Tau
Omega fraternity at Davidson.

The IFC resolution was passed
in a meeting shortly before
spring recess and was present-
ed to the fraternity faculty com-
mittee and the entire college
faculty for approval. The facul-
ty, while taking no formal legis-
lative action, concurred with
the IFC.

The Interfraternity president
announced that another IFC
meeting will be held to define

Prospects Visit
College Campus

Fifty-five high school juniors
and seniors participated in the
first High School Weekend here
last Friday and Saturday, April
11th and 12th. The purpose of
the weekend was to give high
school students who are consid-
ering attending Davidson and
who had never visited the cam-
pus a chance to do so.

All of those who attended
met entrance requirements and
had been accepted by the col-
lege.

‘While d9 the campus the stu-
dents visited classes and saw
several Wildcat teams perform.
The fraternities provided meals
for the visitors.

The participants had to pay
only for their transportation.
The administration and the fra-
ternities paid the visitors’ ex-
penses while the students were
on campus.

LF.C., the administration, and
the fraternities sponsored the
weekend. There are plans to

make this an annual event.

ROTC Makes
Good Showing

Following the completion of the annual ROTC Fed-
eral Inspectiort April 1, Lt. Col. William Adams, PMS&T
at Davidson, stated that General Crump Garvin and the
inspecting team seemed very favorably impressed with

status of the local regiment, its

operation, instruction, equip-

ment, and general proficiency.

Col. Adams said that General

COUNCIL FORMATION

Q. What is your plan for the
formation of the Council?

A. I think that the formation
should take place in three steps.
The first would have the Honor
Council sitting in on Student
Council trials. The second
would let the Honor Council
try the cases, with members of
the Student Council sitting in
as advisors, The third would be
the complete assumption of
trials by the Honor Council,
with the president of the Stu-
dent Body present at all trials
as a non-voting member.

Davidson does. They felt that
the use of this range must give

Bermuda Story Ends At Davidson

Bermudas will be in vogue this week-
end. It is therefore entirely fitting and
proper that a summary of the history
of Bermudas be set down. After reading
this summary the sophisticated David-
sonian can thrill his date with his ex-
tensive knowledge.

The noted historian Chalmers Da-

vidson, in his latest book, An Historian’s
Approach to the Bermudas of the

the Bermudas of this time consisted of
only the buckle.”

But, as man progressed, so did Ber-
mudas. There was great tumult in Rome
the day Julius Caesar stood up in a
smoke-filled Senate and uttered those
immortal words, “Alenda Lux Ubi Orta
Libertas.” It seems that Julius was set-
ting the style by wearing thé first of
the skirt-type Bermudas.

Pithecanthropi, says: “Bermudas were. _pgior to this time the Bermudas had

first used by the Pithecanthropi because
of the usefulness of the buckle for dang-
ling from and swinging back and forth
on limbs. The Pithecanthropus also
found the buckle useful for dragging
home his mate after the annual spring
frolic, It is well to note, however, that

been ROTC brown to blend with un-
washed skin. Cleopatra, in. one of her
revolutionary moods, suggested that
Caesar wear white skirt-type Bermudas.
Julius, unlike the virile Davidsonian,
bowed to her wishes and decreed that
only the emperor could wear them.

By P. SYDNEY YATES

For those who enjoy playing with dolls, their Bermuda
shorts are ready to be cut out and put on,

This special DAVIDSONIAN service is offered in view of
possible shortshort shortages during Spring Frolics.

It was for this reason that Brutus
killed him, Caesar’s famous “Et tu
Brute?” was said when he saw Brutus
approach him wearing white Bermudas.

The skirt-type Bermudas were worn
until the time of Napoleon Bonaparte.
When Napoleon reached Moscow in the
1812 campaign, he decided that he
should sew legs into his skirt, since the
cold Russian wind created a very un-
pleasant draft.

(The reader should note that the
Scottish kilts are descended from
Caesar’s Bermudas. The wind of Scot-
land has not proved as drafty as the
Russian wind.)

Peter Stewart Ney, ‘a mysterious
Frenchman respected for his learning,”
carried so many documents to prove that

he was Napoleon’s Marshal Ney that
he had to sew containers onto his Bermu-
das before he reached Davidson. These
containers developed into the side-poc-
kets of the present Bermudas.

Slick John Cunningham, noted nu-
mismatician, added the rear pocket in
order to carry around endowment pa-
pers and other useful objects he ac-
quired,

Thus the Bermudas have developed
to what they are today. There will be a
variety of colors, sizes, and shapes loose
on the Davidson campus’ this weekend,
some of which may prove in to
behold. But, if the Davidson weather is
consistent, many legs will flee from the
discomfort of our local version of short-
shorts,
