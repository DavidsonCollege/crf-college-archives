Central American
Missionary Shares Experiences

By Sally Stone

Derek Coursen, a mission
worker in Central America, spoke
.to an intimate audience Thursday,
September 10 in the 900 Room.
Coursen spent four years in Nica-
ragua beginning in 1987 and most
recently returned from a one year
mission to El Salvador.

While in El Salvador Coursen
worked for both the Salvadoran
Lutheran. Church and for
CUANES, the human rights moni-
toring arm of the Chicago
Presbytery. CUANES, unlike or-

ganizations similar to Amnesty In-
ternational, tries to take immediate
action against Salvadoran human
rights violations. Coursen was per-
sonally responsible for inquiring
about cases and reporting viola-
tions.

Coursen spoke about the past
year’s peace process. Peace ef-
fostsopened up December31, 1991
when the Salvadoran government
and the warring guerilla movement
FMLN agreed to sign a later ac-
cord, The actual peace accord was
signed on January 16, 1992, end-

ing the twelve-year civil war.
Coursen noted that outlined in the
accord were substantial military
demobilization on both sides, land
redistribution, and government in-
duced economic and social reform.

Foremost in the accord was a
cease-fire agreement to begin Feb-
tuary 1. Coursen emphasized this
component because of its success-
ful maintenance. The factthat fight-
ing has stopped symbolizes El
Salvador’s desire for peace,

College Employees

‘Volunteer in Hurricane

Stricken Louisiana

By Phil Atchison
On Wednesday, Septem-

_ ber 2, a forty-cight foot trailer,

seven college vehicles, and twelve
employces left Davidson as a re-
lief convoy destined for Morgan
City, Louisiana.

The eye, of Hurricane
Andrew had passed directly over
this small town located southwest
of New Orlcans on the gulf. “The
damage was different than that in

Florida,” said Gigi Cooke, one of

the team members. “In Florida the
land is flat and open, and so the
buildings destroyed, primarily
trailer parks and low income hous-
ing, were crowded together in a
very. dense, open area. On the
other hand, the houses and trailers
in south Louisiana were partly shel-
tered by the inlets and bayous of
the state. The damage was still just
as severe as Florida’s, but not as
concentrated.”

The team from Davidson, *
consisting of Sonny Robertson,
Craig Wilson, Debbie Sink, Billy
Hendrix, Ronnie Shirley, Ruben
McIntosh, Keith Frye, Gigi Cooke,
David Holthouser, Jerry Archer,
Ray Thrower, and Bob Collins,
carried with them donated sup-
plies from the Davidson commu-
nity as well as building supplies,
generators, food, and water.

The team willcontinuc
stay in Morgan City, working Mo
of Atkinson Memorial Presbyte-
rian Church, until September 14.

Students interested in
spending their Fall Breaks (Octo-
ber 17-20) in Morgan City helping
those distressed by Hurricane An-
drew should contact Gigi Cooke,
Davidson’s Service Coordinator,
at 892-2460.
