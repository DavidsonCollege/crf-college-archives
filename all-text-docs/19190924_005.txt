correct they should worry. It seems
that C. K. Brown in making his get-a-
way from -Chapel cut loose at the head
of M. Tremain, the piano hammerer,
with a hymn book. Not pausing to be
thankful that he was not smitten with a
rock, the angered sound extractor arous-
ed himself from his dreams of—the
patron saint of music, whoever he is—
and put forth in pursuit, thirsting for
revenge. Since the product of the num-
ber of steps per minute and the length
of each step taken by the Mad Musician °
was greater than the same product pro-
duced by the pursued; Brown, C. K.
was overhauled and boarded at White's
Druggery—a very appropiate place in
view of the prospective bloodiness of the
combat.

The struggle lasted about 3 16-18
‘seconds. Neither sides claim the victory;
in fact there appears to be none to be
claimed.
