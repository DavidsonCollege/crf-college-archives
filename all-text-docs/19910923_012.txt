In The Beginning, There Were Peach Trees

By Marc Overcash

Before Baker, Cunningham,
Dana, Belk, and the four-pillared
Chambers; before Elm, Oak, and
Cedar Row; before the Honor
Code, the By-laws, and the Char-

‘ter, there was the concept. If your
eyes could look back 156 years,
they would find meadowland and
athousand peach trees, notcollege
buildings and thousands of red
bricks.

But to find the origin of
Davidson, your eyes need to rove
elsewhere. Though the college isa
creation of the land itself, the crea-
tors of the concept metin Concord.
For in the beginning, there were
Presbyterian ministers.

The beginning was around
March of 1835. These ministers
organized a committee to locate a
proper site for the Manual Labor
Institution. The committee was
asked to restrict their search to the
land between the Yadkin and

Catawba Rivers and the area about
15 miles from Beatties Ford Road.
It was done. With candles in
hand and prayers for guidance, the
committee selected and signed a
contract at Beaver Dam for two
tracts of land from Mr. William
Lee Davidson, IT. The total amount
of land was 496 acres. Although
they believed the land to be worth
at least $2,500, the committee al-
lowed Davidson to sell the land for
$1,521. In fact, since no bill of
sales existed in Mecklenburg, many
people contest that Davidson never
accepted the moncy for the land.
Even if he did accept the payment,
his donation of $8,000 to the col-
lege and $1,000 to each literary
society easily refunded the sale.
The Manual Labor Institution
does not sound likea pleasant place
to study. In August of 1835 the
Presbytery remedied this imper-
sonal name: “The Manual Labor
Institution which we are about to

build [will] be called Davidson
College as a tribute to the memory
of that distinguished and excellent
man, General William Davidson,
who in the ardor of patriotism,
fearlessly contending for the lib-
erty of his country, fell (univer-
sally lamented) in the battle of
Cowan’s Ford.” General William
Lee Davidson was the father of
William Lee Davidson, II, the
gentleman who sold/donated the
land.

In 1837, the first class of stu-
dents attended Davidson College
for the mere sum of $100.

And though, as Dr. Mary Beaty
points out in her A History of
Davidson College, ““More than 700
colleges in the United States went
out of existence before the Civil
War,” Davidson College still sur-
vives. Though manual labor has
left, the peach trees are gone, and
cows no longer graze on the front
lawn of Chambers, Davidson Col-

the shower. Use the same method described above, without the pillow, as you stand in the-shower.

Other changes to look for are dimples, enlarged blood vessels, and puckered skin. Check for any changes
in size and shape as well. You can check for these changes standing up in front of the mirror. First check with
your arms at your sides, then raise your arms and check again.

If you notice anything unusual, consult your physician. This easy monthly check could make the difference
of life and death in the case of breast cancer.

lege’s concept, “to educate youth
of all classes, without regard to the
distinction of religious denomina-
tions, and thereby promote the more
general diffusion of knowledge and

virtue,” remains as constant as i
was in her early years. Thus
Davidson College, though it out
wardly shifts with time, inwardh
feels the honor of her age..
