With barely a month of regular season play
remaining, the Davidson baseball team finds
itself in a battle for the eighth and final spot in
next month’s Southern Conference Tourna-
ment.

Tied with Furman at 7-11 in SoCon action,
the Wildcats have 12 conference games left
on the schedule, nine of which are at home.

In a non-conference contest last Wednes-
day, the Davidson nine traveled to Chapel
Hill to take on the 13th-ranked Tar Heels.

Despite grabbing an initial lead when se-
nior Tim Frend singled in junior DJ Dailey,

In the seventh, junior Stephen Choate en-
tered with a runner on second and one out, but
retired the next two batters to end the inning.

Junior Matt Hood successfully escaped a
two-on, two-out situation in the eighth and
eventually picked up his second save of the
season.

Senior co-captain James Marino, Navarro
and Dailey each had two hits to pace the
offense.““The bottom of the order generated
some quality offense for us today,” noted
head coach Dick Cooke. “Picking up two
conference wins on the road is very godd.”

For the majority of the spring season, the
Davidson golf team kept concentrating on
improvement, hoping that once conference
championships came around, the team would
be ready.

Judging by their performance at the Wofford
Invitational this past week, the ’Cats are
ready to make some noise.

Thanks to a season-low score in the
tournament’s final round, the Wildcats vaulted
to an eighth place finish at the Wofford Invi-
tational April 12-13 in Spartanburg, SC.

Davidson’s finish was accentuated by a
six-under par 282 in the final round.

Three of the five Davidson golfers went
below par on the tournament’s final day, with
junior Ben Friedell firing a career-low 67.
Friedell’s three-round total of 219 (+3) was
good enough to finish in twelfth place among
all participants.

The rest of the team followed Friedell’s
lead, as the strong final round play proved
infectious.

Freshmen Joe Zimmerman and Peyton
Gallagher both fired a 223, tying them for
twenty-eighth place.

Zimmerman recovered from an opening
round 80 with a pair of strong rounds (73-70)
to help the Davidson effort.

After an auspicious debut last week, Peyton
Gallagher continued his strong rookie effort
with a final round 71, one under par on the
6,841-yard track.

Freshman Dan Koernke came through with
a solid effort, carding a three-round score of
231.

Sophomore Jon Kropski got into the act as
well, rounding out the Davidson attack with
a 235.

Wildcats 5 break par, . top

The University of Virginia took home the
overall team title with a two-under par 862,
one shot ahead of East Carolina.

Steve Marino led the Cavaliers, torching
the Carolina Country Club with a nine-under
par score, including a final round 65.

Chris Piercy of Old Dominion finished
second overall with a 72-71-68 score.

Kirk Satterfield of Furman finished five
shots behind Marino’s pace, coming away
with a third-place finish.

Friedell was encouraged by the team’s
breakout performance. “We took a huge step
in the right direction—we were able to put it
together on Saturday morning and fire the
best round of the day and our best round of the
year by far. We needed a confidence boost
going into the conference tournament and we
got it.”

The ’Cats now know they can contend for
the Southern Conference title. “Now we be-
lieve that we can play with the best teams in
the conference,” remarked Friedell.

“With such a young team anything can

. happen and it doesn’t take much for us to get

on a roll like we showed last Saturday. It is
fun to play well and now we know we can
compete this coming week and maybe do
something really special.”

Coach Straub echoed Friedell’s comments.
“I feel very good about the team and our last
two performances. We are definitely playing
our best as a team heading into the Southern
Conference tournament. The guys have
worked very hard all year and the work is
starting to pay off.”

The Wildcats now look toward the all-
important conference championships at
Furman on April 19-21.

The ’Cats will try to upset tournament
favorites East Tennessee State and host
Furman to win the league title..
