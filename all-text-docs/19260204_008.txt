Joe McConnell Recovers From |
Appendicitis Operation—Fully
Recovered

Joe McConnell is back home again after
an operation for appendicitis. Joe was at a
picture show in Charlotte on the night of |
Saturday, January 2nd, when ‘he suddenly
became sick. He was immediately taken to!
the Charlotte Sanitorium and was operated
on at 5:00 o'clock Sunday morning by Dr. |
Stokes Monroe. He stood the operation well
and has improved steadily ever since. He
came home Thursday, January 14th, and al-
though he is still confined to his home, he is
rapidly regaining his strength.

When Joe first became sick he started to!
come home immediately, but decided to see a
doctor first. He was put to bed and the
doctors then thought that an operation would
not be necessary. A blood test taken later
however, proved that they were mistaken,
and they immediately began to prepare to
operate. Thy were delayeed a little because
of the fact that Joe’s parents, Dr. and Mrs.
J. M. McConnell, were in Florida. The do¢-
tors got in contact with an uncle who lives
in Gastonia and went on with the operation,
which proved successful.

The Thelemite club met with Mrs. W.
W. Wood Friday afternoon,

Davidson Student Returns Doctor Hood Tells |
to Campus After Illness of Tour in Europe

Dr. Frazer Hood, Professor of Educa-

tion and Psychology, who is now touring |

Europe, has been corresponding with

various members of the faculty during |

his leave of absence.

In a recent letter to Captain Weems,
Dr. Hood told of many of the cities that
he has visited. He has just finished a
most delightful three months in Paris.

During this time, he writes that he has,

visited all parts of the surrounding coun-
try, and‘now knows Paris as well as any
American city. He also writes that he has
become very interested in collections of
antiques and other kinds of art.

After Dr. Hood's visit in Paris, he then
went to Nice and is now visiting there.
After a four week’s stay at Nice, Dr.
Hood will leave France and go to Italy.
In Italy, he intends to visit Genoa, Pica,
Florence Rome, Naples, Venice, Milan,
and a number of smaller places. After
visiting these large cities, he will go to
the Italian and Swiss lakes and then to
Geneva. He will again return to Paris
by March reth.

After another month in Paris, Dr. Hood
with his family will gé to England and
Scotland for two or three months, and
then back to the United States.

During his visit at Nice and Paris, Dr.
Hood has had the opportunity to meet
many French officers. Dr. Hood is now
captain in the Officers’ Reserve Corps,

‘and has always shown an interest in mil-
| itary training.

During the war, he was
an officer and rendered valuable service

to the government in the capacity of a!

specialist in Psychology. He has always
been a sponsor of R. O. T. C. at David-
son,

C. F. Smith, editor-in-chief of The David-

Of Jones’ writing while at Davidson the
most noteworthy was a poem of the nature
of parody published in the program of the
Sophomore banquet of last year.

Sunday School work and plans were
discussed at a teacher’s meeting held
Thursday evening at the home of Mrs.

Hears Short Talks

When the speaker of the hour, Mr.
P. D. Miller, President of the Student
30dy of Union Theological Seminary
and a graduate of Davidson, class of ’22,
failed, for some unknown reason, to make
his appearance atthe meeting of
Ministerial Band at 2:15 Sunday after-
noon, the members ofthe band took up-
on themselves the responsibility of car-
rying out a program.

Short, informal talks, which left their
impress on the twenty-five or thirty
members present, were made. Spoofy
Hillhouse told the band of the State Y.
M.-C. A. Convention at Raleigh, which
he recently attended, He told of the
nightly work of the Y. M. C. A. in the
United States, with its millions of dol-
lars worth of property and its thousands
of, trained, efficient, consecrated workers.

He emphasized the part which the active |
work. |

minister plays in Y, M. C. A.
Finally he pointed out the measureless
value of the Y. M. C. A. in its work of
bringing young men and boys to a more

intimate knowledge of Jesus as “a warm!

friend, not a far-off religious leader.”

Don Stuart next spoke, laying par-
ticular stress upon the early morning
Quiet Hour as a means of bringing men
into a closer relationship with God. “If
the devil wins before breakfast he has
carried half the day,” he said.

Archie Williford made the Closing talk
an appeal for a stronger, more evident
spirit of brotherhood among the men on
the campus who have chosen the ministry
as their life work.

With ceremony proper to the occasion
the University of Missouri was formally
