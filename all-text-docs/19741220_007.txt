Freak Predicts State By 18,
Migmi, Raiders Bowl-Bound

I had read a major basket-
ball publication which, in its
pre-season poll, did not have’
Davidson listed in its top 100!

100 teams is a hell of a lot of
teams! (I bet you cannot
name 100 teams, even if I let
you count Pfeiffer, Mars Hill,
Elon, and all those other
“‘biggies’’.)

I won’t mention the name of
this publication, because I’m
afraid Bo Brickels might seek
out the editor and make him
run the circuit.

So, as we approached the
Wofford game, I wondered .
what kind of season we would
have. I proceeded to go
through the schedule and
came up with a 18-7 record as
a logical estimate.

Well, Davidson beats Wof-
ford by 5 points. Granted, it
was. Davidson’s ‘‘real’’
opener, (after beating the
Australian Nationals who
don’t know ‘the difference bet-
ween a basketball hoop’and a
kangaroo pouch) but Wofford
lost to Charleston State by 17
points, who lost to UNCC by 40
points! :

I don’t usually like to com-
pare games, scores,
teams that way, but I couldn’t
avoid such an obvious one.

That Saturday, we go up
against an Ohio State team
that was picked by ‘“‘The Spor-
ting News”’ to finish last in the
Big 10. (Yes, Davidson in-
tellects, that means tenth! )

I can’t say much against a
great team effort in the second
half that did avoid what the

‘ Observer termed “mediocri-

I was interested in the reac-
tions to the win on campus.
Just because Ohio State is a
big name school and has a
great football teami is no”
reason to predict greatness for
the rest of the season.

Nor could I understand the
polls thinking beating OSU
was sufficient to garner
honorable mention votes. Ohio
State, as a national basketball
power, is just not worth much.

I guess we have a loyal
writer who voted for us
because teams like Stetson
and Canisius got votes. -

“On to game #8 vs. Richmond "* “einched “Midway ‘tirdugh the §

and.

and we’re 2-0. Now, Richmond

lost. to “the ‘‘Aussie” team

mentionedearlier: = = =
There is no possible way to

win any games committing .

27 turnovers or shooting 60%
at the free throw line. (I don’t
care how many David Thom-
psons you have on the court .)

We lose to them 67-61, but we
lose one of those games every
year; so I kind of forgot about
that. ene and got ready for a
“must” Princeton game.

Princeton sounded like they
had one great player in a
junior center, Barnes Haupt-
fuher, but they still lost to
Notre Dame by 14 points.

Princeton beats us by 16, as
we have problems with fouls
again. Now where does this
leave our team?

The Charlotte Coliseum ad-
vantage should bring the State
spread from the 20’s down to
about 18.

Going out west,-we are just

hot going to beat U:C,L.A. in

Pauley Pavilion. I think it
would be good to split, the way
we have been playing on the
road so far.

The last prediction I will
make until the next article will
be the Notre Dame game.

*Pre Football Playoffs:

NFC---St. Louis at Minnesota:

Although the Cardinals ex-
ploded for 26 points against
the Giants just to get into this
game, they have still been
playing shaky football ever
since they were knocked from
the unbeaten ranks.

Consistency, home field,
better defense, and playoff ex-
perience give the Vikings the
edge. In the snow, I like Min-
nesota by 5.

NFC---Washington at Los
Angeles:

The Redskins looked very
impressive embarrassing the
Bears last week. (Who
wouldn’t?) Even their reser-
ves looked devestating! (a la
“‘Deacon’’ Jones pinpoint
kieking-accuracy)

non-competitors that they

Delts Demolish Cannon IV,
Library Rats Symb

By C.A. and Y.B.

Ah, the. joy of it all. When
you pick up your DAVID-
SONIAN (which you no doubt
have already done) you will
notice that there are two days
to go until you can weigh an-
chor from this sinking ship.
But enough sarcasm, why
destroy a rare semi-serious
mood? You library rats
probably can’t handle such a
light-hearted column, so turn
back to the index of the rag
sheet.

In A league action last week
on a week ago Wednesday

much to the dismay of the
department, the Kerwood Der-
bies took a laugher from PDT

season. They haven’t had any
pressure on them all season,

' but they’lll have their hands

full in this one.

By. the way, who is their
quarterback now? James
Harris throws the ball
so hard that his receivers
can’t hold on and isn’t their
other QB Ron Jaworski,
Leon’s son?

I think Sonny Jurgensen is
overdue for a championship. I
make it Washington by 1.
AFC---Miami at Oakland:

Some people are saying that

this is the real Super Bowl
game. I think they are right.
. The Ken Stabler-Cliff Bran-
ch combination is un-
stopable. (that includes
Miami’s famed zone
coverage) However, it will
take the whole Raider team to
bring down Larry Csonka.

Miami, with Griese and
Warfield, is too cool under
pressure for Oakland. Even
though Oakland is 12-2, Miami
has a clutch team and have
been to the Super Bowl and
know what it feels like. Miami
by 4.

AFC---Buffalo at Pittsburgh:

Franco Harris is coming on
at the end of the year. Terry
Bradshaw has regained his
form. I think if Pitt can stop
O.J., they don’thave much to
worry about.

Although the Bills. have a
great crop of receivers, Joe
Ferguson is untested in the
playoffs and has been in-
consistent. If the Oilers in-
tercepted him 6 times, how
many will the Steelers pick
off?

OR How many times will the
great Steeler front four (in
specific, ‘“Mean Joe’’ Greene)
ome Ferguson? Pittsburgh —

In the only other A league
action, the Gozinyas showed
the uppity Possums a little
IMAC ‘no blood-no foul’ philos-

ophy as- they nailed down a°

76-45 triumph as Chris Young
popped in“18 to offset Mike
Peskosky’s 20 points.

On Thursday the highly
eminent John “Big Daddy’’
Bird led his newly acquired
Quaphey Doashers to a 48-41
loss at the hands of John Stan-
field or Emanon if you prefer.
Jumpin John had 25 to offset
Bird’s 2 points. Moon Mullins
had 19 but this is a B league
game anyway as we just
realized so eat it Wetzel and
Beach.

In A league ‘Thursday, Six

ed in Division IV, the weakest
division of the A league.

In the best game of the year,
SAE#1 trickled past Beetle leg
47-45 on Rick Mullins’ last
second reverse lay-up. The P
pumped in 25 from down-
town, showing why he is in a
class by himself. But make no
mistake about it, Beetle leg is
tough.

In the mismatch of the cen-
tury, the Delts beat the Can-
non III Gobblers 108-20. Puma
and Barr had 29, but again, the
story is the basic lack of sim-
ple muscular coordination by
these frosh.

Some guy named Eason had
10, but the rest of them are
definitely library rat ~ean-
didates. Ho boy, never seen
anything like it.
