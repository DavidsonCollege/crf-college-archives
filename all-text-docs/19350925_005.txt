Dr. McSween, alumnus of Davidson
College, was former president of Pres-
hyterian College at Clinton, S. C., and
is now pastor of Presbyterian Church
at Chester, S. C.

Professor Foreman chose as his text,
“Thou shalt not steal.” Taking a scene
from Gilbert Chesterton's. book, “Mather
Brown, Detective,” he showed that theft
is theft whether committed by an indi-
vidual or by men who do it within the
sanction of law. Ile stated that theft con-
cerned everybody but to bring it home
to us he would change his text by add-
ing words—"Thou shalt not
from thyself.’ A nation that
away its large natural resources steals
from itself.

He claimed that all of us are robbers
in the fact that whether we know it or
not we are stealing from ourselves. One

of the ways we rob ourselves is by slip-
shod habits formed while we are in col-
lege.

He stated «that there are only some
possessions we can steal from ourselves.
They are our self-respect, enjoyment of
the beautiful things in this world, our
health, our life that is the few years we
are really alive, our

friends which we

stolen by gossip and worry, but the most

is Christ who can be stolen from us only
