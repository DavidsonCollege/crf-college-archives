Tails Of

By JOHN McELVEEN

Once upon a time, in a small
wooded area of the North
Carolina Piedmont, there lived
a family of squirrels. Now these
squirrels weren't your average
type squirrels, for they were
considerably more industrious
and had a brighter coat of fur.

And being so industrious they
established a chain of com-
mand: Van, a short, creative-
type squirrel who, on clear
days, had the peculiar habit of
staring into the blue sky, held
all the power of the group and
generally what he said went as
the WORD.

Yes, on some days of very fair
weather. he could be seen
staring hour upon hour into the
vast blue horizon.

Another prominent member
of this isolated community was
Fessor. Fessorm unlike Van, was
a wood looker instead of a sky
watcher--and indeed, he prided
himself in this aspect.

He observed the changes of
seasons and the subsequent

results. Fessor thus knew when
and how to gather those
precious nuts.

It was Fessor’s job not only
to accumulate this knowledge,
but also to impart it to all the
other squirrels, who, due to the
diversity of names ranging
from Clod to Bo. were referred
toas SAGA.

Now Fessor realized that the
more nuts you had. the
brighter was your fur. Thus he
instructed the SAGA well in the
ways of gathering nuts.

SAGA was a very well-
disciplined group on the whole,
though all the little squirrels
remembered recalcitrant Bur-
ney.

Consequently. everything
went smoothly: the nuts were
gathered by the barrels.

their furs grew brighter and
brighter.

Eventually they were so
bright that no longer was this

isolated community unknown.
News spread quickly
throughout the other wooded
areas of the Carolinas. All

looked upon this colony with ad-
miration--some with envy.

Then one day (I think it was
back in '73) things began to
change.

The once well sapped and syn-
chronous system began to get
out of kilter. Van suddenly
decided that he wanted more
nuts gathered in a_ shorter
period of time--for no particular
reason. (I mean there was no
hand writing in the sky, etc.)

Thus, both Fessor annd the
SAGA were informed of this
decision and set out im-
mediately. They had previously
enjoyed gathering these nuts.
even though many times
traveling long distances to find
them.

Most of their nuts were found
in the county of Libra.

To the Editor:

I am the mother of a David-
son Junior, and I've been
reading with interest the ar-
ticles on both sides about the
BSC proposals.

My son's choice of Davidson
as his college was his own. He
could have gone anywhere he
chose. ied to five and was
accepted by all. The literature
we received on Davidson's con-
cern for recruiting Black
students appealed to me as
much as anything Davidson had
to offer.

This seemed to be in the
tradition that Davidson is a
‘leader’ among institutions of
higher education in what goes
on in this country.

Our first visit to Freshmen
Parent’s Day was a disap-
pointment to me in this respect.
I saw only two Black freshmen
students. Perhaps there were
others.

From my position of an out-
sider looking in, the fact that a
BSC should even have a reason
to exist at Davidson's is a bitter
disappointment to me. Sure, I
know that this is evident around
campuses all over the country.

That almost everywhere,
Blacks and whites are just
about as segregated as if in-
tegration was not the law of this
country.

But for such to exist at David-
son?

It seems to me that priorities
have been overlooked. For in-
stance, Black faculty members
even before Black students were
recruited. Studies in Black
culture before Black students
came on campus with a
dedicated emphasis that all
students should know about the
immense contribution and
heritage Blacks have con-
tributed to our country and the
world.

The suggestion of a car is
rather small in a way, and I'm
sure BSC does not mean they
should be singled out for sole
use of such.

Davidson has always had
students who could not afford
their own car. In fact. the
college's sincere concern with
financial arrangements so

students who wanted to come to
Davidson and who were
qualified, surely has brought
this ‘‘lack"’ up before.

Perhaps there should be a
pool of cars for students to use,
who do not bring cars to the
campus?

My son, brought his car his
freshman year arid he does not
receive financial aid from
Davidson's or any of your
grant-in-aid programs

What BSC is asking seems en-
tirely reasonable, and I'm sure
their requests will spill over in-
to making Davidson a better
place for all students. Mostly,
I'm hoping, it will take the op-
ey for Davidson to be a

leader” again.

To show that Blacks and
whites can live together ~— not
side-by-side seperately - but as
one integrated group of human
beings who have a common
goal.

‘A Davidson Junior's Mother’

To the Editor:

Many students have ex-
pressed surprise that I have not
taken off my black tie and
peace symbol now that we have
“peace with honor" in Vietnam.
May I use your letters column
to explain?

When I began wearing the tie
and peace symbol in 1965, I had
two reasons in mind for doing
so. First was to protest against
the war in Indochina, represen-
ted by the peace symbol.

Second was to mourn for my
country because the actions of
my government (‘Anything
done officially in a democratic
country is done in your name,
because, unless you protest, it is
as if you were doing it in your
own person.’ Victor Gollancz)
in Indochina had violated, even
subverted, the humane and just
principles which the best in U.S.
Society had always represented.
the black tie signifying the
mourning.

I first tried using a black arm-
band, but the peace symbol did

not work well with the arm-
band.

To have engaged in such an
enormous and thorough sub-
version of all that is decent and
fine in U. S. life and history
would seem to require some
sort of penance; therefore when
peace has really come to In-
dochina and the U. S. has spent
one-half as much money in
rebuilding the country as has
been spent in destroying it, I
shall take off my black tie and

ce symbol and don the
t brightest red. white,
and blue tie I can find.

However, upon occasion a few
squirrels, who made extended
journeys, retrieved their nuts
all the way from the small
county of Lab.

Thus, as they had done so
many times before they
gathered together and began to
gather their nuts. They were
most interesting to observe in
their work.

Some would work very hard
at the beginning and then slow
down considerably as time elap-
sed.

Others worked at a moderate
yet constant rate, while still
others worked expremely hard
the entire time.

Though varying in technique,
each gathered his nuts for that
day and then returned to his (or
her) area of the woods situated
between a cornfield and a moor
area.

Everyone was content and
satisfied. The next day the
Squirrels gathered once again.
This continued for ten weeks
straight.

At this time the squirrels
were happily tired and ready
for a break in the routine.

But Van gave word that he
had decided that it was in
SAGA's best interest to con-
tinue their collecting of the
precious nuts.

They, being very well-
disciplined squirrels, followed
this dictum. However, they
tired rapidly and eventually
those nuts didn't look so
precious or worth while. A few
decided to just starve while
others even some of the most in-
dustrious, cut back.

Chatter was heard throughout
the SAGA ranks. Van ignored
this. Suddenly, the once
reknowned bright furs began to
dull, and occasionally one of the
squirrels would lose a good
many hairs from his once fine
coat. (I think humans refer to it
as coming unglued. )

This continued year after
year and the results--well [ need
not lecture to you on those.
Devastating, to say the least.

Thus, my fellow squirrels and

Matters For
Wiser Minds

To the Editor:

I hate to sound so pessimistic.
but we must be realistic, you
know. What makes you think
you have any say in next year’s
calendar. Now if you got a
faculty member or two, there
might be hope.

To be sure. the voice of a
faculty member. PhD. or not.is
worth at least that of a hundred
students. Or how about an ob-
scure trustee from before the
Great War. now there's real
power.

But without them, why waste
your time.

Mathematically it takes only
twelve faculty members to
overrule the whole student
body. Besides. what makes you
so arrogant that you have a
right to help decide the school
calendar.

I mean, the fact that you are
paying a good healthy sum for
this education, the fact that you
are the center around which the
educational system should be
oriented, the fact that you
might be adversely affected by
the proposed calendar, are
surely not justification enough
for your outrage.

And what if it were? What dif-
ference does it make what you
think?

Come on now, let's leave such
weighty matters, that matter so
much to us, for wiser minds.
They are only looking out for
our best interests.

I am appalled that you, naive
student, would be so arrogant
as to assume that your feelings
are more important than the
wisdom of these scholars.
