Brauch Operates Lighting

ifrom Dr. George L. Abernethy.

Gilbert “Buddy” Brauch is the operator of a bewild-

ering bank of switches and dials in the lighting room of |
the Cunningham Fine Arts Building.

As student assstant in all the
functions of the new building,
Brauch’s biggest job is creating
and putting into effect the light-
ing schemes for stage produc-
tions.

LIGHTING SYSTEM

“There are a total of 64 cir-
cuits throughout the theatre.”
said Brauch in explanation of
the lighting system. ‘We have
30 lights, or ‘instruments’. as
we call them, on the catwalk a-
bove the theatre, 22 on the
Stage. and 12 in the floor pock-

ets. The most we can have on!
at a time is 30 circuits; other- |
wise. we'd blow a fuse and
plunge the building into total
darkness.”

Eighteen “dimmers” are used
with the lights to achieve subtle-
ties of intensity and fade-in and
fade-out effects. A multitude of
combinations for dimming ef-
fects are possible with the aid
of a “patch board” system re-
sembling a telephone switch-
board. For color effects. a
transparent. ftexible material
called “cinabex” is used as a
covering for the lights.

“Not Lake By A Dam Site"

BY DAVE PUSEY
Davidsonian Feature Writer

There's much talk in the air concerning the new lake currently being dug by
the Duke Power Company, and the recreational possibilities which it will provide

for North Carolinians.
Water recreation, even aside
from freshman-sophomore water
riots and fraternity shower
parties, is nothing new for Dav-
idson College, however.

her book “Davidson College”

of Lake Wiley.

Lake Wiley, was naméd for
S. H. Wiley, Esq., a resident of
Salisbury and a trustee of the
college. It was he who provided
the funds for the building of the
dam and boat-houses. With this
gift and some of its own funds,
the college purchased, in 1893, }.
fourteen acres of land for the
lake itself and additional! sur-
rounding land for park facilities.

However, in 1909 sewage
pipes were run into the valley
above the lake, and for sanitary
reasons it was necessary to
drain it.

The new lake promises to be
larger and more lasting, but the.
question of its use for college
and fraternity recreation is still
unanswered.
