THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

‘PAGE TWO

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 1958

(All Unsigned Editorials by the Editor)

Welcome To Men Of '62

The DAVIDSONIAN wishes to ex-
tend to the Class of 1962 a hearty
welcome to the campus. From all re-
ports available, it would seem that
this new class has the potential of be-
ing one of Davidson's finest.

It is our hope that this new class
accept quickly its responsibility to
become intelligent and _ interested
citizens of the College community. If
this hope is realized, they can have a
real part in shaping Davidson of the
future; a Davidson of “Southern pre-
dominance and national eminence” in
the field of liberal arts education.

It is unfortunate that this class
must be faced with the problem of a
crowded campus. We think that some-

one owes them ‘an apology for living
conditions which at this writing find
some thirty boys sleeping barracks
style in the gymnasium.

It is even more unfortunate that
many of them. will be studying a cur-
riculum. which, despite signs of pos-
sible revision, in many instances re-
mains outmoded and stale.

However, even considering these
problems and many others, we must
congratulate them on their choice of
a college. They will find in time that
though there is a lot wrong at Da-
vidson there is also a lot very right
here. It will be their problem and re-
sponsibility in the years to come to
see that the “wrong” is reduced to
the absolute minimum.

Thanks To
A Friend

The DAVIDSONIAN lost one of its
most valuable. advisors and closest
friends when Mr. Horace Broyles,
owner and publisher of the ‘“Meck-
lenburg Gazette.” passed away several
days ago.

_ For many years Mr. Broyles,.in. ad-
dijtion to his other duties, printed the
DAVIDSONIAN and acted as the pa-
per’s advisor in regard to makeup and
printing. This paper’s three consecu-
tive “All American” ratings speak
well for his ability.

The Davidson community, and in
fact, all of Mecklenburg County will
feel the loss of Mr. Broyles. He was
a member of that vanishing breed of
men who, almost single handedly, run
small weekly newspapers. From start
to finish his paper, “The Mecklenburg
Gazette” was his own work. He soli-
cited ads, looked for news, wrote a
large number of the stories, and su-
pervised the printing. Of prime im-
portance was the fact that in every-
thing he did, he expressed an inter-
est in the College. the community,
and his county.

The entire DAVIDSONIAN Staff
wishes to express to Mrs. Broyles our
deepest sympathy in the death of Mr.

The other day we happened to be
looking through the famed ‘Faculty
Red Book” of rules and regulations
governing the activities of the David-
son student.

On the inside cover of this publi-
cation there is printed an interesting
statement made several years ago by
the late Dr. Walter Lingle, for years
President of Davidson. It reads some-
thing like this: “There is only one
rule necessary for a Davidson stu-
dent, and that is that he be a gentle-
man.”

Immediately following this dis-
tinguished gentleman’s quote can be
found some thirty-nine pages of vari-
ous and sundry rules and regulations.

Now we like the quote. It has a
nice atmosphere about it. We also
think that the largest part of the rules
are necessary for the smooth func-
tioning of a college. but we think that
neither profit by their close associa-
tion.

Perhaps next year either the quo-
tation or the rules could be omitted.

Foreign Students
Well Impressed

“Uli, what has impresed you
most so far about the U.S.?”

“The high prices.”

The half dozen foreign stu-
dents already on campus have
made it plain that Davidson is
going to be a different place for
their having been here. Fifteen
boys from cleven foreign coun-
tries will attend Davidson this
year on Richardson Foundation
scholarships. All of them on
campus now are friendly, en-
thusiastic and fascinatine indi-
viduals.

A pre-ministerial student
from Bochum. Germany, Uli
Schoening made this remark
about American prices in what
he thought was an off-the-rec-
ord comment. His reaction to
Davidson after only a day here
was, “I’m amazed that the
school provides everything for
the student.”

reaction was “First of all I have
to say that I am most impressed
by the friendliness of all the
people.”

European students, he says,
tend more to be individualists
and associate only with high
school or regional groups. Here
we “don’t care if he’s from
Mississippi.”

Ebbe Justesen plans a chemis-

try major and hopes to become;

an engineer. If he receives a
degree from Davidson, Ebbe,
who is now twenty, will study
eight and a half more years to
complete his engineering train-
ing and four years study of
business. His school was in a
city with no dormitories or
campus, so he likes the “great
park” that constitutes our cam-
pus.

College Initiates
Court Rental Fee

With the opening of David-
son’s new fraternity court, a
special rental-fee system has
been initiated by the college.
The system will stretch pay-
ment of construction and main-
tenance costs over a series of
semesters, lightening financial
burdens for both students and
the college.

After the basic cost of fra-
ternity houses and their expect-
ed tife have been estimated,
the necessary amount to be re-
covered each year will be de-
termined. Rental fees will be
determined on the number of
fraternity members on the cam-
pus.

Upperclassmen will pay an
initial fee of twenty dollars
for the first semester and a Ia-
ter second semester which is
yet undertermined. Fees are
payable at registration.

Freshman pledges will pay
ten dollars for the first semes-
ter and twenty dollars for the
second.

Robert Currie, college busi-
ness manager, stated Wednes-
day that the college anticipates
success for the system if it
“goes along according to esti-
mates.”

will be held Monday and
Tuesday at 5:00 p.m. in

interested are asked to re

By JIM HAMILTON

I sat in the training room of a large southern uni-
versity. The mist rising from the steam table dotted the
new tile walls with moisture. There was moisture also
on the brow of the chef behind the long table.

It was spring outside, but inside thoughts were all
of fall, as the school’s football team straggled in from
the afternoons practice. Winter's fat hung on their huge
bodies. Many were too tired to utter more than a grunt.

They took their trays, which overflowed with food
that was the envy of the common students in the large
dining room behind the training room walls. They sat
down and began the almost mechanical process of eat-
ing—speaking little, grunting often.

Then in swaggered a short, stocky lineman almost

‘as broad as he was tall. His hair was long on his neck

and he grinned a toothy grin. Conversation arose, but
it was an ugly kind. He was the center of attention and
all remarks, cutting remarks, were directed at him. It
was verbal play and he was the toy. But he didn’t realize.
He was the fool, the butt of the jokes, the plaything.
But he didn’t know it.

Finally, in a moment of glee, he exclaimed, “Gee,
you guys must think I was born in the jungle.”

I wondered.

In this group of college students there was no ap-
parent intellectual interest, no desire to learn anything
but football plays. Just the life of an animal earning his
food—or his scholarship.

“Out of the jungle came the cry of the bull ape.”

Out of the training room came the pathetic cry of
the
fossils, but on the gridiron.

But listen, Freshmen! This isn’t that what we con-
sider the Davidson athlete.

The Davidson athlete is only here because he had
a high enough academic average to get in and Davidson
is proud of this.

Coach Dole, for instance, has several potential Phi
Beta Kappas on his first team. And the whole football
Squad average is usually higher than the all men’s aver-
age here on campus. This is why Dole is using pro plays
this year. His boys can learn them.

I don’t want to create the impression that Davidson
athletes are gods on earth, nor do I wish to intimate that
all athletes at big schools or even at the school above
fit into the picture I have drawn.

But the fact remains, the Davidson football player
or basketball player or what have you, has to be a scholar
as well or he won’t be here very long. And that to me
is more important than having teams in the top ten.
