ROCHESTER, N.Y. (CPS) -
Trustees at the Rochester Insti-
tute of Technology have voted to
continue many of the school’s
connections with the Central In-
telligence Agency, but. said all
agreements will be kept public
and under close scrutiny.

In late November, the RIT
board declared “null and void” all
previous agreements between the
‘| agency and the school that had
not been made public, including
those that gave the CIA a role in
determining curricular matters.

A statement released by the
trustees said: “The board believes
that there isnothing inherently
inconsistent with RIT's academic
mission in accepting funding from
the CIA, having current employ-
ees of the CIA on campus, or in
conducting research or studies on
behalf of the CIA.” °

The school’s past ties with
the agency resulted in student
protests and, ultimately, the res-.
ignation of president M. Richard
Rose.

(CPS) -- The glamour of smoking
is in ashes in the 1990s, and col-
lege campuses are taking a hard
look at policies, some with an eye
toward creating an entirely smoke-
free environment in the future.

Many schools are dumping
vending machines, removing ash-
trays from sight, and banishing
smokers either off-campus, or to
small, contained areas away from
non-smokers.

Tucked in the back of school
newspapers are advertisements
claiming to help students quit the
smoking habit. “You Can Do It”
or“‘Let’s Help You Kick That Nasty
Habit” spur the headlines encour-
agingly.

“T don’t think smoking among
college students is considered
cool,” says Randy Hurlow, direc-
tor of communications of the
American Cancer Society in Wash-
ington state. “It’s that they start
before they are 18, and by the time
they are in college, they are ad-
dicted.”

Yet, many college students
continue to smoke.

According to the U. S. Depart-
ment of Health and Human Serv-
ices, arecent survey reflects thatin
the 20-24 year age group, 31.1
percent of males smoke, andQg. 1
of females also have the habit’

People start smoking early --
80 percent, in fact, are addicted by
the time they are 18 years old.
Non-smoking activists are fight-
ing to strengthen laws against
underage smoking so teen-agers
don’t become college students with
a major nicotine addiction.

In December, three studies
published in the Journal of the
American Medical Association
found that the Camel logo; “Joe

children than adults, and isasread-
ily recognizable as Mickey Mouse
by many 6-year olds.

According to a December 23
article in Newsweek magazine,
Camel’s cigarette sales to young
people rose sharply from $6 mil-
liona year prior to using the logoto
$476 million today.

While nearly half the students
were smoking after the war, since
the 1960s, smoking trends have
fluctuated among college-educated
adults over 20, with the smoking at
its peak in the mid-70s.

After warnings from the U. S.
Surgeon General and federal crack-
downs on glitzy tobacco advertis-
ing, there has been a decline in
smoking among people with some
college education, from 42 percent
to 26 percent between 1965 and
1987, according to the American
Lung Association.

The facts about smoking are
grim:

*Based on data from the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics,
smoking is the single largest pre-
ventable cause of premature death
and disability in the United States
andkills more Americanseach year
than cocaine, heroin, alcohol abuse,
drugs, auto accidents, homicide and
suicide combined.

*American still smoke 600
billion cigarettes yearly.

*Though there have been many
lawsuits filed against the tobacco
companies by smokers, recently a
$5 billion class-action suit was filed
by a group of cancer-stricken flight
attendants charging that second-
hand smoke caused the disease.

*Only 13 percent of lung can-
cer patients live five years or more
after diagnosis.

Church Labelled Cult
Targets Pennsylvania Campuses

By Bill Cunnane,

The Student Vanguard
Philadelphia (CPS) -- A funda-
mentalist Christian group called
the Greater Philadelphia Church
of Christ, an affiliate of the Boston
Church of Christ, has begun seek-
ing. converts on college and uni-
versity campuses in the Philadel-
phia area.

According to William Alnor,
of the Philadelphia Cult Aware-
ness Network and president of
Eastern Christian Outreach, “The
Philadelphia Church of Christ is a
horrible blight on the religious
scene in the Philadelphia area. Al-
though they worship God and the
Bible, they use the techniques of a
cult to gain and keep new mem-
bers. They are particularly active
as a destructive force on most of
the college campuses in the re-
gion.”

The church maintains its posi-
tion is legitimate. The Boston
Movement was started by Kip
McKeanin 1979. According tothe
Winter 1990 issue of the move-
ment’s magazine, “Discipleship,”
the membership in the ministries
totaled 28,724 in 1990 and contin-
ues to grow.

Rebecca Fritsley, a current
member of the Greater Philadel-
phia Church, said, “The church of
Christ is not a cult. lam amember
of my own free will. The church
follows the Bible to the letter and I
follow the church.”

A former member describes
the church practices differently:

“They teach a lot about the Bible,
however, they are very restrictive.
All decisions concerning your life
are discussed with a bible study
leader...or with a ‘discipler,’” said
the woman, who asked not to be

This fall, at West Virginia
Wesleyan College, faculty and staff
members voted to ban most smok-
ing oncampus. No sanctions have
been created for those who don’t
comply, say officials, and every-
one on campus uses the honor
system.

“A growing concern for the
health and wellness of our stu-
dents, staff and visitors has been
the stimulus for this policy,” says

J. David Thomas, college treas- _

urer.

Atthe University of Washing-
ton and other state colleges, young
smokers will soon be targeted by a
statewide anti-smoking program
funded by a $7.1 million grant.
Washington state competed’ with
37 other states to receive part of a
$115 million federal grant to re-
search smoking problems in the
State.

At Saint Mary-of-the-Woods
College in Indiana, the administra-
tion did a year-long smoking study

. and developed policies that left the

campus virtually smoke free, with
the exception of a few contained
areas.

Students have become increas-
ingly vocal in their opposition to
smoking.

“Thate it because most géllege
smokers don’ thave any respect for
non-smokers,” says Angela Miller,
20, asophomore at Saint Mary-of-
the-Woods who says she is aller-
gic to cigarette smoke. “A lot of
people hide their smoking habit
because it’s unhealthy.

“It’s not cool. People smoke
because they have friends that
smoke. I getmad because smokers

According to the formerchurch
