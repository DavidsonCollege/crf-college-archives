Re

The absence of educational
innovation elsewhere is tra-
gic; but at Davidson | it’s
abominable.

For: almost four years
now, I have seen horrid por-
tions of student and. faculty
time and effort go to waste;
education has been more
often accomplished despite,
rather than because of, our
practices.

| have seen the sloppy
transition from the old cur-
riculum to the Blue Sky
without fulfilirhent of the

ROWLAND
promises of the Blue Sky.
Too many professors

changed only the numbers
of their courses disregarding
the challenges. of the Blue
Sky. Too many students ac-
ceated the abolition of Sat-
urday classes and institution
of a quarter system withoat
demanding more.

I have seen the coming
and going of Area Exams —
a basically good idea per-
verted in its application by
stagnant minds and abolish-
ed by student pressure and
faculty discontentment.

1 have seen the nominal
institution of Independent
Study. For most faculty and
students alike it has meant
only regular courses with-
out regular classes. Presi-
dent Spencer promised ap-
plication of the Independent
Study ideal to the entire
curriculum at the -beginning
of the year, but | have yet
to hear him elaborate (much
less act on) this promise.

Two unique practices by
Drs. Kincaid and Palmer
have inspired dong discus-
sions with old buddy Hugh
Marr. I offer the following
simple plans which could re-
volutionize education at Da-
vidson and make it what our,
publicity claims (and all
that without additional ex-
pense).

Most ccurses propose to
provide the student with
some competence in a gene-
ral area, whether it be intro-
ductory economics, ethics,
or child psychology. Current-

ly this is meinly accomp—/’

lished by consuming a text
or two and regurgitating it
on_ reviews and exams (pro
perly refracted to fit the pro-
fesor’s biasses, of course).

This is absurd; nothing
worth spending an_ entire
course on can be adequately
covered by so few tests and
only memory of the profes-
sor’s favorite dip is measur-
ed by most tests. |

‘The present testing sys-
tem is rationalized by ap-
pealing to the grading sys-
tem (which) enslavement is
in turn blamed on, the grad-
uate schools). Thus, too
many brownnosers — (with
good short-term memories)
get good grades while
others’ learning experiences

” = *

lections

are down-graded. :

Instead, I propose that the
student determine his grade
on. his work by passing ob~

jective. tests on readings

selected from a bibliography
prepa by the instructor.

No one book covers all the
facets of any area of study
known to me. Thus, it seems
that broad reading in a
field would be most benefi-
cal (one of the excuses for
Area Exams).

The current grading sys-
fem Is absurd because so
much is left to professorial
whim. But the main concern
of the system is supposed
to be the student. Rather than
badger or force the stddent
to do “extra’’ reading, why

not give him positive incen- :

tive? And why not give
grades meaning if we're go-
ing to keep them?

Phychology Professor Pal-
mer. uses an ingenius plan
as part of his courses with
the student submitting -sever-
al multiple choice. questions
on the reading as a» ticket
to take the quiz on that read-
ing. To receive credit for
that reading (Paimer re-
quires a fixed percentage of
correct answers on the quiz
with no penalty and oppor-

tunity to retake the quiz if

one falls short. The idea is
to acquire’ a certain com-
mand of the material cov-
ered, not to punish failure.

The advantages of this
plan are outstanding. The
multiple choice form offers a
quick-scoring measure of the
student’s work. And it’s re-
latively objective.

Palmer sets point ranges
for each grade and the stu-
dent determines. the num-

ber of points he accumulates

by his work. But he also
gives reviews and exams
which cover the text and
lectures. —~

What I am, recommending
is somewhat more extensive
application of Palmer's
extra-reading plan.

Why not test reading of

“the text in the same way?

Atter all, what is important
is the student’s command of
the materials; assigning a
symbol of failure or barely
passirig does not relieve the
student and the professor of
that responsibility.

‘Another important facet of
Palmer’s plan is that the bi-
bliography is open ended; it
can be added to by agree-
ment of the instructor and
student. No one with a David-
son professor's teaching
load can keep up with every-
thing in his field and there
is no reason to limit the stu-
dent.

But learning is more than
reading and multiple-choice;
I agree. The other facets of
my plan include significant,
qualitative elements but <%

an essay, or an opinion! _.
As a requirement “for

: Again this would depend on

the goals of the course.

s

Classes should be attended

only on the: basis of their
worth. No one (at least at
Davidson) should have to
hear someone paraphrase
the text, tell his favorite
anecdotes, or lecture unless
he wants to. Classes should
be stimulating, informative,
and lively. Films, speakers,
debates, and active learning
should be rampant, not rare.

I would make exams de-
manding, subjective essay
affairs and most important-
ly — ungraded. They should

ming abilities.

Some. courses would not -

fit this plan — notably lan-
guages, science, and mathe-
matics “— and they shauld
not be forced into that pat-
tern. For these, | have other
ideas.

Dr. Kincaid gives’ unan-
nounced reviews, I'm told.
And others give pop writs.
Knowing that any day he is
subject to testing on specific
blocks of material, the stu-
dent is forced to learn by
accumulation. In other
words, you have to keep up.
As a check against a mis-
calculated cut or extenuating
circumstances, I'm told Kin-
caid allows the student to
drop his lowest grade from
the record. Again the student

would know in advance
the . material he was _ re-
sponsible for and that

would be judged relatively
objectively. .

of na one able to quantita-

' The ideas offered above
would, if applied, maximize
the use of faculty and stu-
dent resources and ingenui-
ty, They would not require
additional funds or curricu-
jum overhaul; they would
use what we have.

Davidson does not need an

of faculty; it needs one in-

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Students Forced To Live
In Homosexual World

My point is that isolating

To The Editor:

This letter is probably
what we don't need. Another
cry for coeducation in vague
and general terms, from a
studént.

But in the face of asinine
and twofaced remarks. com-
ing from the administration,
I will say what I have to
say, and shut up

This college (i.e. its lead-
ers) need to take a serious
look at the effects on those
of us (students only) who
are being forced to live in a
homosexual world here at
Davidson, in the technical
sense of the term.

A lot of gibberish has been
said. and printed about the
beastiality of ‘‘those horny

bastards’’ asking for girls to
-' enliven their idle moments.

The request is selfish and
childish, they say. |
But this is not what we
are asking for in coeduca-
tion. We are asking only. for
a chance to live in an adult

.. world: with a serious intel-

lectual environment, not one
which comes from having -

arothing else to do.

ie

Serious intellectual work
cannot be done by. emotional
cripples, and no one ever
had a serious thought who
did not know Love.

Why can’t it happen here?
Davidson is, all hip debun-
kery aside, a potential in-
tellectual_ Garden of Eden. I
call it nothing but Perversion
to try to keep this garden
Sacred by eliminating The
Dangerous Female from the
field of our temptations.

The perversions of sex
which faculty expect of stu-
dents are in fact held by
‘anybody who defines ‘‘the
garden’’ and its amazing
productivity in terms of its
‘isolation from the Real
World.

Intellectual output comes
with Experience, not before
or in spite of.

It looks like what they
want here is a cloister peo-
pled by Good Teachers who
can‘inspire their Eager Stu-
dents to lay off masturbation
long enough to get into grad-
uate school, at which time
they might “have thelr fun”

and get down to the real |

business of “intellectual pro-

ductivity.”

young men from ‘Experience
has the opposite effect. It
dulls their minds at an early
age. It builds in their Freu-
do-Skinnerian minds a reac-
tion against books if not
Beauty.

And if the monks have
done their work well, the
little egg heads will have to
keep on getting their kicks
from Henry Miller because
if and when Love does come
to them they won't be
able even to recognize it (or
not as well as they would
have if the little seeds had
grown in a more fertile en-
vironment).

I hope some administrator
stays up at least one full
night thinking about those
students who leave Davidson
with the same wrong notions
about sex they came in
with, wet behind the ears,
since there has been nothing
— literally nothing — at Da-
vidson which could be ex-

pected to change _ their
minds.
‘Nothing that ‘‘they’’ ever
gave us.
