Balance Keynotes New ‘Live Rhymin

By RUSSELL CARTER
Staff Writer

Since his break-up with Art
Garfunkel. Paul Simon has
released two excellent solo
studio albums. ‘‘Paul Simon”
and ‘‘There Goes Rhymin’
Simon.’ Containing incisive
material such as ‘‘Duncan.”
‘*Kodachrome.’' and
“American Tune.” the recor-
dings firmly established
Simon as a master of the con-
temporary narrative song.

On his new release. a live
concert album entitled ‘‘Live
Rhymin,’ *’ Simon proves him-
self to be a consistently
original and superbly talented
so!o vocalist and folk
guitarist.

The true genius of the per-
formance faithfully captured
on this album lies in 4 multi-

24

leveled balance of the various
musical elements which
Simon achieves and maintains
from the first song to the last.

In general. he alternates
performances of five songs
which were Simon and Gar-
funkel hits, with five tunes
from his solo albums.

In terms of style, Simon ef-
fectively compliments his
simple sclo folk tunes with his
more complex songs based on
black rhythm and blues and
gospel motifs and performed
with back-up band ac-
companiment.

Simon paces each song
brilliantly by balancing
restrained three-finger guitar
picking against accentuated

full chord strumming.
His vocal embellishments of
ballad phrases blend

It was a light in the dark delight to learn that FOOD has
reopened in Concord. The gigantic neon sign on the interstate
spells FOOD, and that’s where the name comes from. Who
knows what the restaurant’s real name is—I’m no journalist.

During the day, FOOD is a nearly ordinary restaurant serving
lunches that are cheaper than Slater's. Their pie is outstanding
and should not be passed up.

FOOD is at its best late at night when nothing else is open. In
those hours, every sandwich on the menu is a four-star
specialty.

Eating there the other night was no different from any other
trip I have ever made to FOOD. Out 73 to Concord, not another
car in sight. Then up I-85 a couple of miles to the first exit--how
could anyone miss it?

Truckers sat in singles and pairs drinking coffee and talking
trucks, I imagine. A paucitous Durer's mother, her skull spar-
sely upholstered with affected hair , smoked alone. There is a
juke box spiced with country greats in every booth. but no one
seemed to mind.

My egg, bacon, cheese, tomato. and onion sandwich came.
Exquisite. What time was it? Trucks droned outside; a spoon hit
the floor. One man cursed while another man laughed.

A waitress sitting at the counter yawned, ‘open 24 hours a
day, 365 days a year,’ she had told me. Steam condensed on the
windows. The ageless truckstop treat -of the nocturnal elite
floated on, held aloft by bright lights and black coffee.

Studies have proved that people will forego shelter, warmth.
sports, and even sex in order to eat, which accounts for the
shallow consciousness of people whose behavior is determined
primarily by their stomachs.

Eating is grand - I love a good gorgie - but there is a point
beyond which one’s senseless indulgence causes others to go

ungry.
You have probably heard about the grape and lettuce boycott,
and you may be thinking ‘‘Oh gosh, here goes my tossed salad.”’
But first, here is a word about what it is all about.

i farmworkers are attempting to unionize - the only
alternative available for a people who have no legal residence
due to the nature of their jobs. Through unionization, they hope
to attain privileges that you and I see as basic rights—primary
, an end to the necessity of child
labor,.and sanitary living accomodations.

It is commonplace in migrant camps to see (as I have)
shallow wells for drinking water within spitting distance of open
latrines. Farm owners and large grocers argue that provision of
these rights will raise the cost of produce. That may be so, but
ethically we cannot deny other people their human necessities in
order to get a head of lettuce for 2¢ less.

So, as far as lettuce goes, try to avoid eating the usual head
lettuce. The tastier varieties (leafy, bib, interharvest) are

beautifully with the three part
harmonies provided by the
Jessy Dixon Singers, one of his
back-up groups.

‘Live Rhymin’ "’ opens with
a confident rolicking version
of ‘‘Me and Julio Down by the
Schoolyard.’ This is followed
by a moving rendition of the
classic, ‘‘Homeward Bound.”
Simon's voice rings clearly
above a typically tactful
guitar solo.

The version of ‘American
Tune” reveals an intricate
guitar chordal structure
which was obscured on the
studio version by a heavily
mixed string arrangement.
This live cut is Paul Simon at
his very best.

After these songs, the artist
introduces Urubamba, a
group which backs him on
well-executed versions of ‘‘E]

Condor Pasa,’’ ‘‘Duncan,”’
and ‘‘The Boxer.’’ The group
adds tasteful vocal harmonies

and unique instrumentations,
using percussion, flutes, and
the charango.

Simon surprises the crowd
with a new verse to the old
song, ‘“‘The Boxer.’’ He up-
dates the song, singing ‘‘Now
the years are rolling by

am older than I once was and
I'm younger than I'll be/that’s
not unusual./No it isn't
strange/after changes upon
changes we are more or less
the same.”

For the next four songs, the
Jessy Dixon Singers, a group
Simon first came into contact
with at the Newport Jazz
Festival in 1972, join him on
stage.

‘Bridge over Troubled
Water,’’ the masterpiece from
Simon and Garfunkel's last
album is performed next. The
rendition differs radically
from the studio recording.

By FRAZIER MARSH

Simon originally composed
the song for guitar, and he now
sings and plays the song
backed by strong background

vocal harmonies.
The base guitar work on this

song is excellent. It is the best
I have heard since Paul Mc-
Cartney’s on ‘‘Sgt. Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band.”
The album closes with a
final Paul Simon classic com-
position. He performs
‘‘America,"’ originally recor-
ded on ‘‘Bookends,"’ as a vocal
solo with his guitar. It comes
across as a masterfully com-

plete production.

During the week of March 27-31, the bigtop will once again be
raised and Ringling Brothers Circus will present its 1974 ex-
travaganza. This year the circus will feature many more animal
attractions, plus over fifty more clowns have been added.

The circus will be in Charlotte Coliseum, with the shows begin-
ning at 4:15 and 8:15 p.m. For tickets call the coliseum.

March 30th will be the opening night for the spring production
at the Charlotte Little Theatre. The production will be Neil
Simon's smash hit, ‘The Last of the Red Hot Lovers’’.

This show was a successful long-running production on Broad-
way, and Charlotte Little Theatre's production will be just as ex-

me/They are rocking evenly/1

citing. For tickets call the Little Theatre this week.

‘Man On A Swing’

Frank Perry’s ‘‘Man on a Swing”
is at least an improvement over his
last two movies, ‘‘Doc”’ and ‘‘Play It
as It Lays.’’ These were so crudely
directed as to leave me wondering
how they could possibly be by the
same man who did ‘‘David and
Lisa’’ and ‘‘Last Summer.”

At his best, Perry is a fairly com-
petent imitator of other directors.
‘*Man on a Swing” is not his best, but
it is smoothly and serviceably direc-
ted. Occasionally, it even seems in-
spired.

The opening shot with the camera
fixed on the upper half of a moving
police car is admirably framed, as
are a few other shots, and there is
one scene which is altogether good.

The critics who defend Perry
praise him for the plastic quality
that his films sometime get from his
slick personality, his cardboard
characterizations, and his tendency
to show us people he does not like.
Personally, I seldom find that the
characteristics of Perry's films
come together for any distinguished
results.

There is, however, one scene in
‘Man on a Swing” that impresses
me. It is the one in which two
psychologists, played by Elizabeth
Wilson and Ron Weyand, interview a
clairvoyant, played by Joel Grey.

Cliff Robertson sits in the
backround trying to keep a straight
face while Wilson and Weyard ex-
pertly indulge in heavily mannered,
semi-comic which are
virtual caricatures of the highly
idiosyncratic performance that
Grey has been giving throughout.

The director’s cynical exploitation

of his actors makes fun of an ex-
cellent performance by Grey. The
scene works in part because it is
beautifully photographed and also
because it seems very much a part
of Perry's personality.

I have trouble caring about any
film that I don't think the director
cares about, and this is one problem
with ‘‘Man on a Swing."’ Why should
Perry suddenly make a movie about
cops investigating a case at this
point in his career?

There is no reason except that
perhaps he was attracted to David
Zelag Goodman's screenplay by a
possibility he saw for an actor in the
role of the neurotic cl ~voyant.
Perhaps he even had Joel Grey in
mind when he first decided to do the
project, for Perry is often an in-
spired caster of actors.

He is also occasionally an ex-
cellent director of actors, and Grey's
performance here is one of several
outstanding ones in Perry’s films.
(Howard da Silva in ‘‘David and
Lisa,’ Cathy Burns in ‘“‘Last Sum-
mer,’’ Carrie Snodgrass in ‘‘Diary of
‘aes ree pallersmiasese. Ford in
“Play it as It Lays” are especiall
memorable.) y

Unfortunately, Grey's per-
formance occupies only about half of
the film’s running time. A lot of time
is wasted as Cliff Robertson, who
playing a police officer, questions
various people about a murder.
Robertson never finds a character to
play in this film, which is no wonder,
considering the screenplay.

At least the film is lively when
Grey is on.
