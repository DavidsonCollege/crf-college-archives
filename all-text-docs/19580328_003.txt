Dear folks,

The weather continues its eternal combat with the
Davidson athletes, and only the calendar assures us that
the curtain is up.on spring. Wildcat coaches are frantic
to get a good practice in edgewise.

o

Now the elements have taken up the issue with
the ROTC department too. War games have been
forced indoors of late, and, with the big one com-
ing up next Tuesday, coach Stowe has his fingers
crossed that his men can go the distance.

The Kappa Sigs, who picked up twelve fraternal
headpieces during the recent I-F hoop campaign, found
the master hatchet wielders of the other teams ganged
up on them Wednesday night. The long and the short
of the matter was Dave Bradford and Bill Ferguson.
Ferguson popped in 23 points, and Bradford picked the
backboard clean to pace a 48-39 win for the All-Stars.

Speaking of I-F sports, it seems to have become
the fashion to win the intramural titles with perfect
records. The Betas started it all with a perfect hand-
ball mark, followed by the Kappa Sigs’ unblemished
basketball title. Now the Phi Delts have slipped safe-
ly past all the others in volleyball and ping pong.

Should either the Kapna Sigs or the Phi Delts win
the I-F sports trophy this year, it will mark the seventh
Straight, year that one of the two has carried it home.

Coach Dick McKee, knee-deep in tennis wealth,
traveled with his boys down to South Carolina this week-
end to cross racquets with Furman and Wofford. McKee
looks to these matches as an opportunity to see just

Bil! Patton, Barney Regen,
and Dave Hollingsworth stood
out as the mainstays of the
team throughout the  tourna-
ment; their “spiking” ability

Sonny Ferguson, Bill Fergu-

the Kappa Sigs, sparked by Ken

Marvin Bentley took third

hurled the javelin for a third
in that event.

Though Coach Heath
Whittle has potentially a
very good team this year,
wet weather has cut down
on thoir practice sessions,
and injuries to several key
men have hurt the overall
team strength.
Al McKay and

Angus Me-

Bryde in the sprints and middle

in the longer runs, and Cenegy
in the javelin have all been
sidelined temporarily by yari-
ous injuries.

Although Coach Whittle
doesn’t expect to do extremely
well against a strong Richmond
team today, he is looking for-
ward to a very good meet with
Wake Forest on Richardson
Field’s revitalized track.

He is also hoping to have the
team at full strength and in
top shape for the triangular
meet with N. C. State and Clem-

Linksmen Lose One,
Meet BBI, Furman

By RAY THOMAS

“We have a good team, but it
wasn't our day,” commented
coach Scott concerning the de-
feat of the Davidson golf team
by the hand of Wake Forest
last Tuesday. The score was 21
to 6.

The best game for the Wild-
cats was shot by Ned Payne,
who had a 74. Scott considered
this very good considering the
bad weather. Payne. along with
Gary Heeseman and Verner
Stanley, scored two points each.

Also shooting were Sam
Sloan, Sut Alexander. and
Bucky Dennis. Although de-
feated by a large margin, coach
Scott is optimistic about the
rest of the season. He notes
that the team is well balanced
and will be a contender for the
Southern Conference crown.

CITADEL MATCH OFF

The match set for tomorrow
with The Citadel has been
called off. There will be a match
this Monday between Davidson,
Furman, and Babson Business
Institute. Scott hopes that the
Wildcats will come into their
own in this match and show
their real power.

In the near future the jayvee
team will meet the linksmen
from Gastonia High School.
This team 1s composed of Bill
Purks, Johnny Mackorell, Gil-
mour Lake, Bob Baker, Eb Le-
Master, and Andy Agett. With

these men to be contenders for
