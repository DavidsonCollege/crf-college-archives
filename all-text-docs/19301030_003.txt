A rejuvenated band of V. P. I. Gobblers
came back into the game in the second half,
scored three touchdowns, and two extra
points, to down the Davidson Wildcats 20
to 19 in as thrilling a game as any football
fan should ever want to see.

The Wildcats seemed to be able to gain
at will through the V. P. I. line during-the
first half, only the excellent kicking of
“ Hooper preventing freer scoring. After driv-
ing up the field to within the, shadow of the
Virginia team’s goal, they were denied what
looked like an inevitable score When Hunt-
ley intercepted Fraley’s pass. But the Wild-
cats came right on back up the field after
Hooper had kicked out of danger and Don
King took a neat pass from Captain Fraley
to cross the V. P. I. goal line standing up.
This concluded the scoring for the first half,
although Davidson threatened constantly and
had V. P. I. well under control.

The second half presented a scoring melee,
five touchdowns being made, three of which

Hall made 29 yards to bring the ball to
Davidson’s 32-yard line. Hall and Hooper
hammered the Wildcat line for consistent
short gains, with Hall going over from the

blocked, leaving the score tied.

The Wildcats became thoroughly aroused
at this and aided by two long runs of Mc-
Call were able to bring the ball to V. P. L.'s

reliable combination of Fraley to King gave
Davidson its second touchdown. Brock made
the extra point.

back and scored their second touchdown.

'Wildkittens Battle
Rutherford to Tie

The Davidson Wildkittens started things
|off in fine shape last Friday for the home-
| coming events of the past week-end by tying
the strong Rutherford College Ramblers in
a»game packed with thrills from beginning
to end. The score was 6-6. The game was
one of much ground gaining and little scor-
ing.

Rutherford started the fireworks early in
the game when they took the opening kick?
off'on their own 30-yard line and began a
70-yard march that ended in their only
marker. Led by Bronson and Tanner, the
Ramblers marched down the field for three
consecutive first downs and then a 30-yard
pass from Johnson to J. Bumgarner resulted
in the first score of the game. Bronson’s
place-kick was wide.

In the second quarter Davidson lost the
ball on the Ramblers’ one-foot marker, lack-
ing the punch to put it across. Davidson again
went on a 58-yard march only to lose the
ball on a fumble which Johnson recovered,
The third period uneventful but the
Freshmen, after having lost the opportunity
to score, were not to be denied, for in the
fourth quarter they started a 59-yard march
which ended in the tying score of the game.
The feature of this drive was a 20- yard |
pass, West to Curlee. Harnsberger plunged |
over for the touchdown. West's attempt to
place-kick the extra point failed.

For the visitors,» J. Bumgarner, Tate,
Johnson and Randall were the shining lights.
For the Freshmen, West, O’Keefe, and
Wooten were the stars. Wooten, the David-
son pivot man, was the feature of the en-
tire encounter.

Inter-Class Basketball
Schedule Is Under Way

Seniors and Juniors Met Last Night

With all their kinks ironed out the four
basketball teams closed their three
weeks of practice Tuesday and are now
looking forward to the scheduled games with
each other. The schedule opened last night
when the Juniors met the Seniors in the
first contest. Tomorrow night at 7:30 the
Sophomores engage with the Freshmen five
for their first game.

Thus far the Sophomores seem to have
the best team. Most of them, members of
last year’s Freshman team, have. developed
their true form under the tutelage of Bill
Goodson, and to go far
Winning the championship.

Coach Carl Pritchett has develoned: a fine
team from the thirty
reporting practice for the Freshman
Harlan, McLain, and Morris,
Evans, a guard, and Lawther, a cen-
look best among the first year men, and
will probably start Friday night against the
Sophomores.

Besides Coach Martin, Montgomery, Pat-
rick, Arnold and McGhee loom as the best
prospects for the Juniors. Among the twenty
gen who have been going out for the Seniors,
Coach Rusk, Wilson, Smith, Hoge, Shepard,
Corbett and Caldwell look best, five
being possible starters.

The schedule calls for three games a week,
which will be played on Mondays, Wednes-
days and Fridays of each week until every
team has played each other twice. All games

Ten Wrestlers Aniuer
First ‘Call for Practice

Ten men answered Geach “Doc” Uncen
first call for wrestlers last Wednesday.
Among those to report were: French Cowan,
115-pound class; Ed Gorham, 125-pound;
Thad Brock, 145-pound; Captain Pie Con-
way, 155-pound; Bud Raker, 175-pound, and
Pat Boyle, All the above are let-
termen back from last year, while Captain
Conway was state clidmpion in his weight.

Workouts will be held three times a week
at present including only light workouts and
skull practice for the grapplers not out for
football. Strenuous workouts will not begin
until after Thanksgiving so as to afford
ithe matmen out for football an equal chance
for the team.

Coach Unger, who will have complete
charge of wrestling this year, is a former
Indiana University grappler. He represented
that school for two years, winning the Big
Ten heavyweight championship his senior
year. Unger is also coaching Freshman foot-
ball along with Flake Laird.

LOOKING

"EM OVER

With W. H. Matthews

It has been said no less than ten
times by every Davidson man since
Saturday, we suppose, but we will say
it again: “That was a tough game to
lose.” Seldom has a Davidson team
so much offensive power
against a strong opponent, seldom has
it so thoroughly outclassed a team
during a first half and then have a
seemingly comfortable lead wiped out
by a last period comeback.

Davidson showed the most powerful
offense that has been displayed this
year. They swept up the field for
56 yards and a touchdown in four
plays after the Gobblers had gotten
their first marker and the score was
tied. They marched unstopped for 58
yards and their third touchdown in
six plays. It was a hard defeat to
take, and yet it had to be done.
