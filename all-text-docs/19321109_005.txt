You_know how it is. If a cigarette is mild—that is, not
harsh or bitter, but smokes cool and smooth—then you like
it and don’t worry about how many or how often-you smoke.

And if it tastes right—that is, not oversweet, not flat—
then you enjoy it all the more.

The right kind of ripe, sweet Domestic and Turkish to-
bacco...the right ageing and blending...make Chesterfields
milder, better-tasting .. .They Satisfy!
