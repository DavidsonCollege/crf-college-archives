‘Vhe Devoidsonian—3

[continued from page’! ]

He described Stealth as an ‘emanation process’ which
would ‘spread in concentric circles’ from his office to all
administrative ranks.

‘I've been secretly employing some Stealth principles
in my own work for several years now,’ Spencer said,
‘and this year we applied it to the offices of Chaplain
and of Vice-President for Development.”’

Just who does the Stealth plan protect the College
from? \

“THEM...’’ Spencer whispered in his dimly lit office,
where he had summoned this Devoidsonian reporter.

“You know ... the lawyers, the students, the press, the
faculty, the Republicans, the Moral Majority, they’re
out to get us.”

Reaction to Spencer’s plan was enthusiastic.

“It’s awesome!”’ said Dean of Students Will Terry,
who was wearing his Stealth hairdo for the occasion.
“T mean, look what it’s done for God in 2,000 years!”’
Terry said he had he had endorsed Spencer’s Stealth
plan for the chaplainship as soon as he was sure it was
not an Honor Code violation. ‘‘I guess you can’t
plagiarize God,’’ he noted.

Athletic Director Gene Bingham, who was busily
collecting money in Florida for the new Stealth Athletic
Complex when Spencer’s announcement came out, said
in a phone interview, ‘‘Lordy Jemima. it’s a
super-dooper plan. There are lots of corporations down
here with Stealth policies. Land developers and such. It
warms the cockles of my heart to see my old aima mater
take up some sound, proven corporate pobcies.”’

Bingham said he had found Stealth tactics useful
during his year here, especially in times of hirings and
firings and stuff.”

Vice President for Academic Affairs Price Zimmer-
mann was surprised at Spencer’s plan. ‘‘I knew nothing
