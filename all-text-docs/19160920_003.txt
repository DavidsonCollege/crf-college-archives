Literary Societies
Hold First Meetings

Prospects Are Bright for Year of
Successful Work. .

The two literary societies held their
first meetings Saturday night, September
16th, and the prospects for a successful
year’s work are bright.

In the Philanthropic society the off-
cers for the first term are: S. T. Hen-
derson, president; W. C. Cumming,
vice-president; R. D. Hall, secretary;
R. H. Ratchford, first critic; C. F.
Monroe, second critic; W. T. Dunlap.
first. supervisor; W. C. Neel, second
supervisor. Three upper-classmen, twen-
ty-two Freshmen and two old members
who have been out of college were re-
ceived into membership.

In the Eumenean socitey, L. H. Eikel
is president; J. R. Woods, vice-presi-
dent: E. A. Solomon. secretary T. J.
Mitchell, reviewer. In this society, the
Freshmen, instead of being received into
the main society, join the Freshman so-
cietv, which meets on Monday night of
each week. After a few months the
officers, who are the same in both
branches, nominate for membership in
the regular society those Freshmen
whose work shows that they are worthy
of joining.

The‘ twofold purpose in organizing
this Freshman society is to limit the
membership to those men who are really
in earnest and who will be a credit to
the society, and enable the Freshmen to
do better work in that they will not be
embarrassed by the presence of the up-
per-classmen. At the meeting Saturdav
night four upper-classmen were received,
and Monday night cighteen Freshmen
joined the branch society,

Those joining the Philanthropic society
were: T. R. Alexander. Misenheinier,
H. H: Menzies and H. §. Lott, upper-
clasemen; J. T. Maddrey and ©. C.
Williamson, old members returning; and
from the new men: Boney, Caldwell,
Calhoun. R. M. Calhoun, L. G.* Car-
riker, Chalmers, Davenport, Dawkins.
Foscue, Tremaine. W. T. Hall, H. C.
Hamilton, Kerr, Lacy, Leyburn, DL. L.
McAlister, 1. W. Roberts, Smith,
Spence, Spratt and Thomas.

In the Eumenean society the upper-
classmen were: Flynn, Carwvle. Burns
and Hollingsworth. The. members of
the Freshman society are: R. R. Craig.
McClerkin, Shields. Penick. Moore,
McCaskill, Withers. McCutcheon
Pope, Smith, Crawford, Harris, Liston.
Burgen. Love, Bird, Richards and J. FE.
Richards.

THE “PUTITOFFS.”

My friend, have you heard of the town
of Yawn,
On the banks of the river Slow,
Where blooms the Waitawhile flower
fair, ;
Where the Sometimeorother scents the
air,
And the soft Goeasys grow ?

It lies in the valley of What's theuse,
In the province of Letitslide,

That tired feeling is native there—

It’s the name of the listless Idon’tcare,
Where the Puitioffs abide.

HAS EVOLUTION COLLAPSED?
By Rev. A. E. Eagleson.

The Biblical World, a magazine edit-
ed by Shailer- Mathews, of Chicago Uni-
versity, has a symposium of the views
of thirteen scientists in its February
number, in answer to the following
question, addressed to each one of them,
viz.; “Does modern science still .believe
in evolution?” Six of the scientists are
professors in the University of Chicago,
the other seven are scattered around
over the country, and unfortunately
Princeton is credited with one of them.
All of these men express themselves in
positive terms, that evolution is now an
accepted fact among all scientists.

But let me here show that these sciet-
tists are very unscientific scientists.

First. They all chime in with the
same “‘speil”: That scientists accept
fully the theory of evolution. Now,
among so many, one would have thought
that some one of them would have quali-
fied the kind of evolution he believed in.
Yet not one of the thirteen made any
qualification whatever.

Second. They all agree the scientists
are more divided than at any former
time, as to the manner or method by
which this evolution has been effected.

Third. Is it scientific to conclude that
where the bones of existing species differ
from the fossil bones of some species
that lived millions of years ago, that
therefore these ancient species have evolv
ed themselves into the new existing
species? Would not a specific man
want the proof of this fact before he ac-
cepted this change, as having been made
through evolution? To conclude that
these were the bones of the same species,
which had undergone a change of anat-
omy, but had not changed the species is
sheer assumption. “This is not science.

Fourth. How is the public to know
whether these professors believe in evo-
lution through natural selection or ‘de-
scent,” or by some blind, unreasoning.
inherent, potential law within the par-
ticles of matter of which the body is
composed, or under the superintending
guidance of a Divine hand, or from the
influence of environment, or something
else? .

Fifth. Would a scientific man, know-
ing as all these professors ought to have

|known, the wide range covered by the

term “evolution,” have left his true po-
sition undetermined? Is the public safe
in accepting the “dictum” of a set of
men who are no more precise in express-
ing themselves than these professors are ?
Some of these professors express then-
selves as incensed, that certain preachers
say, “that evolution has collapsed.”
Well, if there is nothing more substan-
tial to hold it up than the science of
these scientists, what is there to keep it
from collapsing ?

Sixth. Is it scientific to hold that evo-
lution is an established fact until there is
some, undoubted evidence showing the
manner in which this evolution — has
taken place? It is mere assumption to
hold that fossil bones which have laid in
the ground for millions of years, belong
to the same species that are now in ex-
istence when these bones differ radically
in their formation.

Such evidence would not go in any
court. That the four-toed bones, sup-
posed to belong to the horse species, of
millions of years ago, have  evoluted
themselves either with or without Divine
help, these professors do not say how,
into the one-toed. horse of the present
day, is a fancy which ought not to be
received as a proven fact, especially so,
when it is relied on to discredit the
Scripture account of the creation of man,

Those scientists who favor evolution
seem to depend more upon the __ fossil
bones of the horse species which are col-
lected in greater numbers than of other
species to prove the doctrine of evolu-

tion. But no one of them would want

to be hung on the evidence which they

produce to prove that the present horse
has been evoluted from this ancient spe-
cies of the horse kind, whose bones differ
in conformation from the present-day
horse bones. Yet they would be willing
to rely on it to discredit the Genesis ac-
count of man's creation.

The theological professor who will
supercede Genesis by a theory of evolu-
tion, based on such evidence, is capable
of producing a phase of intellect of a
lighter cast than the imagination.

Is “evolution” the word these profes-
sors want to use here? Let some com-
mon man come to the aid of these scier:-
tists, and suggest a word that would le
more suitable.

IT have just read Prof. William A.
Locy’s work, of North Western Unive: -
sity, “Biology and Its Makers,” and al-
though it gives an interesting sketch of
all the important scientists who have had
any connection with the making — of
biology, I do not recall that any two of
them agree. Could it be certain that
any problem in Euclid was proven until
at least a majority of mathematicians
agreed that the solution was right?

Is it any more rational to believe that
“evolution” is proven until its supporters
agree as to its “how?”

Prof. H. W. Conn, of Wesleyan
Jniversity,. recently published “Evolu-
tion of Today,” which he concludes as
follows, viz.: “At present, then, while
it is well to admit with the scientists
that “organic evolution” is — probably
true, and that it “may or may not” in-
chide man, it is also evident that the
complete explanation of the theory has
not been reached.” “Above all, the in-
vestigations have not brought scientists
much nearer the real significance of life
itself. which, Hike all other first: princi-
ples, becomes the more inexplicable, the
more it is studied.”

Notice, that he only assumes that “or-
uanic evolution” is “probably true.” A
common pleas judge, with the evidence
he presents, would not grant that a prob-
ability even was established: Now, what
is the public to judge about evolution,
from the opinion of these thirteen’ pro-
fessors, six of whom are in the Chicago
University 2— United Presbyterian.

“Gee, Jim. she t'inks dat Tm a wonder,
and she knows her little lad

Could never mix with nothing that was
