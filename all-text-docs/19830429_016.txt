The rock band R.E.M. will play in Love Auditorium Friday, May 5 at8 p.m.

Tickets are $2 and are now on sale.

The Athens, Ga.-based group appeared last February in the 900 Room to
a sold-out crowd. “We had to turn students away. | didn’t talk to anyone who
didn't like it,” said Concert Committee Chairman Jim Hoskins.

Oh-OK will open for R.E.M. The performance will be open to the public,

and 1,200 seats will be sold.
