‘ Sackett Meets President

At White House Reception

By BOB STRAUSER
Davidsonian Feature Editor

While others must content them-
selves on weekends with excursions
to local institutions of feminine re-
sidence, Senior class president Fred
Sackett embarked last Saturday for
a reception at the White House. Over
two hundred campus leaders attend-
ed from schools throughout the coun-
ry.

As the weekend guest of Colonel
Robert A. Brolling, Sackett was driven
to the southwest gate of the White
House grounds. Accompanied by Sara
Ann Porter of Sweet Briar, he entered
the diplomatic reception room and
made his way upstairs to the East
room where the proceedings were just
getting underway.

Secretaries McNamara, Rusk and
Wirtz spoke briefly to the assembled
students some of whom, including the
Davidson representative, had to stand.
President Johnson concluded the pre-
sentation of speakers and then depart-

» ed for the Blue Room.

RECEPTION IN BLUE ROOM

President and Mrs. Johnson and
Lynda Bird, official hostess for the
affair, formed a receiving line in the
Blue Room, as students were announc-
ed individually by aides and conduct-
ed through the room.
“Pred Sackett, Davidson College,
.% North Carolina” was one of those first
‘ formally introduced to the President.
* “But,” said Sackett modestly, “they
f did the same for everybody.”
> Johnson spoke to the Davidson
representative for some two minutes
on such matters as West Virginia
“(Sackett’s home State) and the pre-
- sent administration's debt to Davidson
* for producing Dean Rusk.

“SAY HELLO TO GRIER!”

Earlier, Fred had spoken briefly

riedly excused himself with “I must
go to a State Department meeting; say
hello to Grier Martin for me.”

After a buffet dinner topped off
with cherry tarts and washed down
with a choice of ginger ale or coke,
Sackett and several other students
talked with Defense Secretary Mc-
Namara for about 15 minutes. ‘‘A bril-
liant man even in casual conversa-
tion,” noted Fred.

NSA REUNION

The Davidson representative met
some old friends and acquaintances
from home and from the recent NSA
convention in Minneapolis. Said
Sackett, “This was the most tremend-
ous group of students I’ve had the
privilege of being with.”

Closing out the evening was en-
tertainment in the East Room, the
Chad Mitchell Trio, Bob Newhart and
the Stan Getz jazz quartet entertained 3
the campus politicians.

With the appearance of Newhart,
the President entered the room to
listen to a take-off on possibilities of
the “hot line.” At the conclusion of
the comedian’s routine, Johnson ex-
cused himself for the evening.

When the ceremonies had con-
cluded, the student leaders had been
exposed to the opinions of top a
stration officials on the need for lead-
ership among youth in the nuclear
age. Everyone had their picture taken

th the President—to appear later
in hometown papers.

“A, WONDERFUL DREAM” .

The evening ended early and let-
down was inevitable. In Sackett’s own
words, “I walked out the front ent-
rance onto Pennsylvania Avenue and
a wonderful dream had come true.”

Will Jackson was to have been
Davidson’s representative but had to
remain with the football team for the
Saturday night game at The Citadel.

By HARRY CARR
Davidsonien Staff Writer
With four weeks of the first
semester gone, Mrs. Peter Nic-
holls, supervisor of dormitories,
reports that there are still two
students awaiting their perman-

ent room assignments in David-

son dormitories.

According to Mrs. Nicholls,
however, this is a small figure
in comparison to the 12 to 20
boys who are usually displaced
at the start of each session.
Two dropouts and the conver-
sion of the Watts’ guest room
have provided space for four
who were originally. without
rooms.

With dormitory space for
952, the enrollment stands at
1001. The exodus of 25 juniors
to Burope and the increase of
freshmen to 279 have created

At the mercy of the Freshman Court

Freshman Court Keeps
Sentencing Offenders

By JACK AUGUSTITUS
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Freshman Court, meeting once again to see justice done and to dole out punish-
ment, found the offending freshmen to be humbler, more repentant, and more re-
signed to their fate than the last time the court met.

Perhaps the freshmen now
come to court with pure and
contrite hearts because of a
growing respect for the Fresh-

man Regulations, but it is more
probable that they have dis-
covered that punishment is
handed out in relation to their
attitude toward the court and
not aceording to the offense.

The “typical offender” will
find himself helping with ques-
tionnaires or running errands
tionaires or running errands
in the infirmary if he accepts
his fate without question. A
more belligerent young gentle-
man may find himself cutting
branches on the cross country
course or scraping gum off
chapel seats which might have
been placed there by himself
the day before.

Recently, two freshmen were
brought the court for a minor
violation of the regulations.
Weeping large crocodile tears
and begging the forgivness of
the court, they stood trial. For
this action, insead of manual
labor, they must, in the next
two weeks, review Freshman

Regulations and make a study
of school spirit.

When they have completed
this study, they must make a
report on their findings to the
court. The court, not wishing
only tp punish, but to teach the
freshman something more, felt
that this would do them more
good than any amount of manu-
al labor could ever do. —

The contest for the Joe Jones
Award continues with Jesse
Sims still holding the lead
and Ed Peel in second place.
Amid rumors of tar and feath-
ers being hidden in the closets
of Cannon, Watts and East Sims
who has already been treated
to an informal shower party
continues to do his duty of
seeing that the freshmen be-
come Davidson Gentlemen. One
compensation to the freshman,
however, is that Jesse turns

them in with a smile.

One member oc the court
outlined the goal and ideals
of the court by saying, “The
general attitude of the court
towards the responsibility given
them has been to point out
to the freshmen some of the
positive attributes and goals of
the Freshman Regulations.

“We feel that, besides con-
tinuing the tradition, the main
goal of the Freshman Regula-
tions is to help the freshmen
realize that they have not yet
become full fledged Davidson
Men. It is also to inspire in
them a little of the respon-

sibilities toward the more im-
porant regulations such as the
Student Body and Honor Court
Regulation.”

The day that all of the mem-
bers of the court look to is the
day when there will bo no of-
fenders. They feel that when
this occurs their job will be
done.

Wishing to have the last
word, however, a freshman was
heard as he waiked out of court
after being sentenced, to mut-
ter under his breath, “Judge
not lest ye be judged.” He

‘might well be a sincere false

prophet.

Freshman Parents Day
this year will actually, if
not officially, develop into
Parents Weekend. A num-
ber of activities are planned
so that the parents will be
informed and entertained
whether they stay all week-
end or just for the main pro-
gram on Nov. 7.

According to Dr. Richard C.
Burts, Dean of Students, the
program will begin Friday

4 night, Nov. 6, with a freshman

football game against Furman.
Saturday’s agenda includes the

, traditional tours and recep-

tions. Local ministers will prob-
ably be asked to present Par-
ents Day sermons Sunday for
those who stay over, Burts said.

The Freshman Council, which
sponsors Parents Day in con-
juction with the administration
has already reviewed and ap
proved the plans.

Dean Burts emphasized that
admission to the ball game
Friday night will be on a first-
come, first-served basis. Once
the 6,000 available seats are
filled no one else will be allow-
to enter.

The Freshman Council will
arrrange a schedule of cam-
pus tours, dormitory visitations
and classroom visitation for
Saturday morning. Individual
professors will determine on the
basis of available space and
schedule lags if and when par-
ents can visit their classes.

A buffet luncheon will be
served Saturday, followed by
@ program at 2 p. m. when
‘President Grier Martin and
Dean Burts will speak. The
Chapel Choir will also perform.
Later there will be a reception
on the front campus where par-
ents can meet the faculty mem-
bers.

The drama department will
present Shakespeare’s ‘“Corio-
lanus” Saturday night. A nomi-
nal fee will be charged. Stud-
ents who wish to do so are
urged to see the play Thursday
or Friday night, so that this
space will be available for par-
ents on Saturday. —
