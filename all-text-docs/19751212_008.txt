Board confirms
McAvoy, Hutchinson

By SCOTT REID
Senior News Editor

The Publications Board approved
unopposed candidates Susan McAvoy
and Robbie Hutchinson as 1976— 77
Quips and Cranks co-editors, jobs to
which they said they hope to bring
their own organizational and creative
skills.
~ Both McAvoy and Hutchinson
have worked on the staff of the Quips
and Cranks for the last two-and-a-half
years.

““‘We’ve been working together on
the sports staff ever since our
freshman year,’’ said McAvoy. ‘I
kiddingly suggested then that we run
together for the editorship our junior
year. I guess Robbie must have taken
it seriously though.”’

Hutchinson expressed dissatisfac-
tion with past editorial organization.

“Through our three years here, the
staff of the yearbook has been pretty
apathetic,’’ he said. ‘“‘This was the
main problem with the editor last.
year, that and disorganization. The
secret is starting out on the ground
floor and getting organized soon.

“This spring we will be giving out
assignments to upperclassmen and
making sure they are committed to
them. Most of the planning will
probably be done in the spring and
summer before we come back to
school.

“We haven’t gotten to the specifics
of planning yet. That takes time. Any
ideas we have will get better with
time--like good wine,’’ said Hutchin-
son.

“We haven’t thought of a theme for
the book yet or worked on any of the
other details,’’ added McAvoy, ‘“‘and
we weren't going to until we were sure
we were going to be doing the job.

“We also don’t want to say a bunch
of things before we get them planned

out. We could disappoint people by
speculating now.”

McAvoy and Hutchinson indicated
they differ slightly in their approach
to yearbook editing.

“I’m a photography man,’’ said
Hutchinson, ‘‘and Sue is a copy
editor. For three years we have
differed on the idea of copy in the
yearbook telling the story.

“We haven’t reached a_ specific
agreement on this subject, but the
yearbook will not be copy-domina-

McAvoy noted that a co-editorship
would relieve the burdens from study
loads on just one person. “The
different creative ideas we have will
increase the chances of a person liking
the yearbook rather than if it were
just my book or his book.

Last year a big issue on campus

was the censorship of the yearbook by
college administration members, ac-
cording to the two. Hutchinson and
McAvoy appear to have similar
opinions on the subject of censorship.

“If it is a student publication, it isa
student publication,’’ added Hutchin-
son. ‘‘As student editors, we should
have enough integrity so as to be able
to distinguish between the tasteful
and tasteless, between the aesthetic

and unaesthetic.

“If there are no written guidelines,
it then falls to our own integrity
which is where the responsibility
should lie anyway.

“The apathy which has pervaded
the operations of the yearbook since
we've been here,”’ said McAvoy, ‘has
caused us to be more enthusiastic
about the book next year.”’

Publication and delivery
dates for the 1974-75 Quips
and Cranks are still un-
decided, according to Asso-
ciate Director of Alumni Rela-
tions Zack Long.

Long was appointed Editor-
in-Chief of the 1974-75 year-
book when the student elected
Editor-in-Chief Carrol Ensley
graduated and left the year-
book unfinished.

Ensley has not returned
candid senior photos and class
pictures which will be used in
the annual. These pictures are

valued at between $600 and
$1000.

Long indicated he has been
forced to delay decisions about
the format of the annual untill
these pictures are returned or
replaced.

Ensley promised in an Oct-
ober 16 letter to Long to have
all of the annual materials
including the pictures at the
printer’s by mid-November.

In a recent telephone con-
versation, Ensley assured col-
lege Business Manager Robert
A. Currie that Long would
recieve the photos by the end
of this week.

Smith Studios would charge

$800 to reprint class photo-
graphs. The candid photos
submitted by individual sen-
iors wuold be difficult to
replace.

“We have no schedule. We
may have to cut down on
pages, but we hope that it
won't be necessary. Copy is
being written and pictures are
being taken to finish the
various sections,” said. Long.

Long has completed the
yearbook introduction. The
Del Mar Printing Co., printer
of The Quips and Cranks,
quoted a new price for publi-
cation of the 1975-76 year-
book.

Golden retains WDAV management

WDAV Station Manager Jack Gol-
den, who said he began the year
“pretty shakily” as appointed re-
placement for Mark Wilensky, will be
confirmed by the Senate next Tues-
day as new station manager. He is
unopposed for the position.

‘At the start I had only four people
for a staff, excluding the d.j.’s’”’
recalled Golden. ‘“‘We needed a news
director, two assistant station mana-
gers, and, most of all, we needed a
first-class licensed engineer.

“The first night during freshman
orientation when we were to broad-
cast, we weren’t sure whether we were
going to be on FM or just AM carrier
current. It wasn’t until fifteen min-
utes before we were to go on the air
that we were able to get a first-class
engineer to sign a one-week contract
‘with us.

“Since that time I have gotten
Derry Harper, who worked with WBT
News this last summer, to be our
news director. I have also recently
promoted Bill Burkholder and Will-
iam Beasley to the two assistant
station manager positions. Bill will
assist us on technical matters, and
William will be in charge of program-
ming.”

Golden noted that he has created
two new positions at the station.
Sally Stow. is the programming

GOLDEN

assistant in charge of examining
program logsheets kept by each d.j.
to insure that logsheets meet Federal
Communication Commission regula-
tory standards.

Landon Thompson fills the second
new position of promotions director.
He will serve as the station link to the
community. Not only will he receive
community service announcements,
but he is in charge of publicizing
WDAV programming as well.

“I felt that these two functions
were so interrelated and consume so
moderate an amount. of one’s time
that it would be best to combine the

two into one position,’’ said Golden.

“We are still having trouble in
getting ABC News on the air,” he
added. .““We have already received
permission from ABC and WGNC in

Gastonia to use the news service for
free.

“The only problem we have now is
getting our engineer, Jeffrey L.
Watts, to install the subcarrier re-

ceiver which will pick up. the news:
‘signal. ri

“From what we understand, Watts
has the receiver‘and needs only to
make a few adjustments on it. We
should be ready to use the news by
the first week after we return in
January.

“Right now we plan to put the news
on roughly every two hours through-
out the day. We may add times or cut
back. We'll be experimenting to see
what times are most convenient for
our listeners and our programming.”

Another area of interest for WDAV
listeners, according to Golden, is the
possibility of changing the station’s
present monophonic signal into a
stereophonic one.

“Right now the main problem with
our going stereo is our need for an
accurate interpretation of FCC regu-
lations,”’ he said. ‘‘We don’t know
whether or not we need a stereo

modulation monitor, (a device which
measures a station signal to prohibit

interference with signals of other
stations).

“Our engineer says he can get us a
stereo signal generator for nothing,
but he doesn’t know where to get a
modulation monitor if one is required.

‘Another thing is that we’d need a
stereo control board for the studio. A
new board would cost a great deal of
money. As a consequence we are
thinking of initiating some kind of
communications fund drive to go
stereo.”

One area Golden wants to deal with
before he leaves office a year from now
is the station functions in relation to
the other campus organizations.

“I know we are the newest student
medium on campus. Besides the
YM/YWCA, we have more students
involved in our operations than any
other organization on campus,” Gol-
den claimed. ‘‘Nonetheless, the sta-
tion has a constitution which in recent
years has been abandoned de facto.

“In addition, the station operates
under the SGA By-laws which are a
great deal simpler than the old station
constitution.

“Which document should we be
operating under? This is the type of
question I want answered before I
leave office.

“We need to define our position so
that we can operate efficiently with
the other organizations on campus,”
Golden concluded.
