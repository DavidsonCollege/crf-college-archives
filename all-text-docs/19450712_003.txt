Luck has struck

readers I have re-
ceived, as the Sports

ious Davidsonian, a
letter trom one of

hang on

letter and a part of
my answer.
The Sports Editor,
Dgyidsonian ;
Davidson, N. C.
Dear Editor:

1 haven't got any
idea what your name is or what sort of a fellow you are,
but if you are Sports Editor you must be a sports lover
and you are the one to answer my questions.

By JOE STUKES

I am one of the many Davidsonians who was snatched
abruptly and rudely by Uncle Sam when he needed some
men to help him fight this war. During the two-and-a
half years, | have been away from’ Davidson, all my con-
nections, with it have been severed,

I was a non-fraternity man and a non-varsity man, but
| was very, very interested in everything athletic. For
over a year I fought for the Independents: in football,
basketball, volleyball, and softball. Softball was my favo-
rite and we always got beat in it. I suppose you are play-
ing softball now, so write me about the league.

What are the prospects of a varsity football team this
fall? 1 surely hope you field one but I don’t want it to”be
a “moral victory” team that we are famous for.

Time for mail call, editor, so I’d better stop this.. If 1
don’t now, I never will. You see my return address, let
me hear from you if you have time.

Sincerely,
(Serviceman’s Name Withheld)

Dear Tom:

Your letter came Sunday just before I settled down to
write a column. I am taking the liberty of printing parts
of it (the printable parts) and writing an answer to it
for my column. I'll see that you get at least two copies
of the Davidsonian.

[ have been here only 18 months so I am not fully quali-
fied to tell you all about the past athletics.
tell you this summer’s action and next fall’s hopes.

The softball league is made up of five teams: the Betas
and Thetas from Beta Theta Pi; the Pi-Kappa-Pikas from
Pi Kappa Phi and Pi Kappa Alpha; the SOTs from all
thé other active frats. The Independents have one team.
The schedule called for. them to have two, which would
simplify matters a lot. We then would have six teams and
they would each play three, or maybe only two games a
week. but they could only field one.

So [Il only

I have heard only what everyone else has about next
fall’s football team. We have tentatively scheduled games
with colleges. Coach McEver went to Carolina last year
and his brother, “Mac” went with him. But Carl Snavely
is once again taking over Carolina’s reins and so “Bull”
and ‘‘Mac’” went to V.P.I. They didn’t fare so well at
Carolina, but I expect them to do better up in Virginia.
I surely hope they do.

This is about all I have to tell you about current sports,
but I’ll add some more in the rest of this letter.

Well, readers, we come to the three-oh mark for this
week. This letter shows that inter-murals can mean as
much as varsity to a man.

More and more I keep pleading with you.
longer do I have to wait for that volunteer ?

The Independents, behind the cap-

Johnson's pitching seems to be the
nucleus of the Beta team. His fast
ball has been observed by all, and
must be admitted that he has some-
thing behind that pitch which a-
mazes all.

The Sots and the Pi Kapps-Pikas
don't seem to be fairing so well on

the surface. The Sots have won

one game, defeating the Betas,
which must be classed as an upset,
at least by the defeated team. The
Pi Kapps-Pikas haven't won.a single
game as yet, and as a result have
the honor of occupying the basement
floor in the league. However, de-
finite improvement has been shown
behind Blain’s pitching and Walker’s
catching. Incidently, Markey makes
an excellent short stop for the luck-
less combination.
