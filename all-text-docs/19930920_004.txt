Popular school
programs attract
students and
prospectives

By Rachel Dunifon

By graduation, about 50% of
each Davidson class: has studied
abroad for a year, semester, orsum-
mer. Options for study abroad
programs are endless, and
Davidson itself offers a wide range
of programs in nearly every area,

allowing students to receive.

Davidson credit while in a foreign
country. Davidson’s well-known
study abroad programs are what
attract many students tocome here.

Davidson sponsors year-round
programs in Germany and France.
French students, along with a
Davidson professor, study in Mont-
pelier through the Paul Valery
University of Montpelier. Students
choose from a wide variety of
classes, taught in French, includ-
ing the history of Europe, French
literature, education, and political
science.

Upon arriving in Germany,

Time Away From Davidson
Davidson spreads throughout the world

Davidson students live with a Ger-
man family for one month, to get a
feel for the culture and brush-upon
their German before classes begin.
Students then begin studying at the
University of Wurzberg, taking
regular classes.

Davidson’s Spanish Depart-
ment hopes to join its French and
German counterparts next year by
offering its own study abroad pro-
gram. Currently, Davidson stu-
dents studying in Spain gothrough
programs at other schools. Ac-
cording to Dr. Luis Pena, next
year’s addition of a new Spanish
professor will change that. This
professor will direct study abroad
programs in Spain, offering stu-
dents the chance to study for a
semester or for the full year.

Pena says the department is
considering schools in Madrid,
Valencia, and Salamanca, and is
looking for universities there able
to adapt to Davidson’s semester
system. Spanish students also cur-
rently have the option of studying
in Mexico in a summer program
led by Dr. Pena.

Notas well known is the year-
long Davidson program of the
American Collegiate Consortium
for East-West Cultural and Aca-

demic Exchange. Through this
program, two students from the
former Soviet Union study at
Davidson for a year, while
Davidson students, who must be
fluent in Russian, may study there.
Ashley Cockrill, ’93 was the first
Davidson student to spend a year
in the Former Soviet Union. Jun-
ior Charlie Pollster has just begun
his year of study there. :

Davidson’s semester-long
programs include some unique of-
ferings. The Seminar Abroad in
Classical Humanities, sometimes
called “Humes on wheels,” travels
continuously during its four
months, visiting ancient sites
throughout Greece, Crete, Turkey,
Italy and France. The program,
offered every other year, is led this
spring by Dr. Dirk French, and
students will receive three Clas-

sics credits, as well as acredit for -

an independent study.

Davidson also sponsors a se-
mester-long program of study in
India, offered in alternate fall se-
mesters. The next trip will depart
in the Fall of 1994, and will be led
by Dr. Job Thomas of the History
Department. Students are housed

Running the gamut of social experiences

Students can
design their
own programs

Senior Jen Guise wanted the
opportunity to immerse herself in
a non-western culture when she
studied abroad last semester. As a
result, she spent the semester in
Nepal, becoming a part of this
unique culture in terms of language,
dress, and custom.

The Office of Experiential
Programs referred Guise to the
School for International Training,
based in Bradelboro, Vermont.
They sponsor “experimental learn-
ing programs,” with the goal of
allowing students to live in a cul-
ture as muchas possible, and offer-
ing programs world-wide.

Guise spent her semester in
Nepal with eighteen other students
from throughout the United States.
The first month was spent in a
village, wherea3:1 student/teacher
ratio facilitated their intensive
Nepali language studies.

The next month was spent in
Katmandu, with students living
with local families. They attended
a lecture series and continued their
language studies. Guise describes
the learning as very “hands-on.”
For example, her group traveled to
a Buddhist monastery and learned
how to meditate in order to learn
about this aspect of Nepali culture.

The program’s third month
was an independent study project,
in which Guise traveled alone to a
Gurung village to study the unique

type of music found there. She
then went hiking for ten days,
reaching an elevation of 17,700 ft.,
all the time wearing the customary
native skirt, called a loongy.

According to Guise, her cul-
tural immersion showed her how
much Westerners traveling abroad
stand out in other countries. She
suffered more culture shock re-
turning home to the United States
than she did when she arrived in
Nepal, and is still getting used to
being back.

Heather Hill’s spring semes-
ter abroad would create culture
shocks . She traveled around the
world on the University of
Pittsburgh’s Semester-At-Sea pro-
gram. For four months Heather
lived with 403 students on a small
cruise ship. Sailing from the Baha-
mas, the ship stopped in Venezu-
ela, Brazil, South Africa, Kenya,
India, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Tai-
wan, and Japan before returning to
Seattle.

Describingit as “the best thing
I’ll ever do in my whole life,”

Heather especially appreciated the
trip’s multicultural immersion.
While docked in China, Heather
traveled to Beijing where she
Stayed at the university and met
other Chinese students, some with
whom she keeps in contact.

The school, or ship, would
organize excursions like the one to
Beijing for the students. This con-

venient and useful service allowed -

students to be spontaneous in their
travel plans, Heather remarked. A
safari in Kenya was another trip of
which she took full advantage.

Such varied experiences were
main assets of Semester-At-Sea.
Heather described the trip asa field
study of cultures and learned about
the United States and herself along
the way.

for British Television in London with a Boston University
program. The group took advantage of travel opportunities

Experiencing a world beyond
Davidson, exploring options not
available here are two primary rea-
sons many Davidson students
choose to spend summers, semes-
ters, or years elsewhere.

For many, this exploration
meansselecting a “non-Davidson”
abroad program more suitable to
their interests.

According to the Study
Abroad office coordinator, Carolyn
Ortmayer, students interested in
unique abroad programs learn from
friends about options or simply
examine the books and files in the
study abroad office. This year nine
students are “on-leave” forthe year
and thirty-nine are gone this se-
mester.

Defined as “on-leave,” stu-
dents attending non-Davidsonpro-
grams receive several pass/fail
credits, depending upon the aca-
demic intensity.

Great Britain and Spain are
the two more popular sites stu-
dents historically choose.

Margaret Murphy, one of the
DCTV coordinators, wanted more
television experience and also
knew she wanted to study abroad
in the spring of her junior year.
Learning about’ Boston
University’s London internship
program from several upperclass-
men, Margaret began her pursuit.

Combining an academic
course load with working, the Lon-
don school offered Margaret the

opportunity to attend journalism .

classes unavailable at Davidson
and work at British Television. The
courses were taught by U.S. pro-
fessors for which she received Pass/
Fail credit from Davidson.

The Boston semester pro-
vided “a good balance between
academics and working,” Marga-
ret said. Spending three and one
half months in London, Margaret’s
experience gave her “the best of

both worlds” and was a great break
from Davidson.

Lisa Moore’s semester away
from Davidson did not expand
across the ocean, but it too marked
an experience unparalleled at
Davidson. Lisa attended Howard
University in Washington, D.C. in
the spring as a member of the
Davidson-Howard Exchange.

Inaddition tohercourses, Lisa
worked for the Children’s Defense
Fund.

Besides living in an urban at-
mosphere, Lisa chose the Howard
program for its diverse classes and
the internship opportunities in
Washington. Asenior political sci-
ence major, Lisa attended unique
courses such as “Race and Public
Policy”, “Simulation of Interna-
tional Organization”, and “Blacks
in the Arts” unavailable at
Davidson. Also an accomplished
cellist, she played with Howard’s
string ensemble and took cello les-
sons.

Her Washington experience
allowed Lisa a better understand-
ing of why students attend black
colleges.

As she learned, every day, in
every class African or African-
American issues are raised or top-
ics discussed pertaining to minor-
ity issues. Furthermore, Howard
offered an economically diverse
population.

Mary Hartman wanted a se-
mester abroad. As an art history
major, Davidson offers several pro-
grams applicable to her field, but
only in the spring. So Mary inves-
tigated outside art history programs

-and found CYA, College Year in

Athens.

Living in an apartment with
other CYA students, in a “safe”
neighborhood of Athens enriched
Mary’s experience.

She met many native residents
and became comfortable with the
city. Most importantly, Athens
was a perfect location for studying
classical art and architecture.

Mary greatly appreciated the
unique attributes of her program
and how they pertained to her in-
terests. Selecting one’s own abroad
program allows students to focus
on their interests and receive a
“hands-on” education.
