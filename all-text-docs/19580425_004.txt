Shearer Hall Stands as a

Eyesore

The Davidson campus is blessed. with an ample number of beautiful neo-clas-
sic buildings among which there stands out a grey-stucco eyesore. This eyesore is one
of the oldest buildings on our campus. Though now a gruesome sight, it was at one

time in harmony with the
interesting history.

Davidson College was found-
ed in 1836. In the summer of
the following year construction
on a chapel was begun; the
chapel was completed: in 1838.
The building stood north of
and facing the area between the
Philanthropic and Eumenean
Hall. The chapel was believed to
of the present Philanthropic

The Air Force pilot or navigator is a man of
many talents. He is, first of all, a master of
the air—and no finer exists. In addition, he
has a firm background in engineering, elec-
tronics, astro-navigation and allied fields.
Then, too, he must show outstanding quali-
ties of initiative, leadership and self-reliance.
He is, in short, a man eminently prepared for

Examines Parties

Dr. William G. McGavock
head of the Faculty Social Life
Committee, recently reported
on the work the committee has
done with regard to fraternity
problems.

Dr. McGavock stated that last
month Dean Pietenpol asked
his committee to study the
problem of Hell Week and the
after-dance party situation and
to present recommendations to
the faculty. This committee has
met four times, including one
session with the IFC.

The IFC recently took action
on the Hell Week question by
voting to abolish it. The social
Life Committee recommended
this decision to the faculty.

The Committee has been
working on the after-dance par-
ity question but has reached no
final conclusions. Committee
members have been talking to

Shooting Case
Hearing Waived

Preliminary hearings were
waived Thursday in the first
action of legal proceedings
against James Hambright, who
was involved in the shooting
death of Bill. Redding at David-
son last April 3.

The hearing, slated for ne-|
corder’s Court in Charlotte, was
waived in a move described as
“rather mechanical.” The ac-
tion was not thought to be in-
dicative of any future action.

The case will now be referred
to a Grand Jury. If a “true bill”
(sufficient evidence for trial) is
returned by the court, the case
will go to a Superior Court and
be tried. If a “not-true bill” is
returned Hambright will be free
without trial.

ever made to Davidson by a
