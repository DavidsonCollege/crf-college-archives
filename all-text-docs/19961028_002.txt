New Union committee visits
nearby unions for inspiration

By ANDREW PRESTON
Staff Writer

Recently, the Planning Com-
mittee for a New College Union
visited three other college unions
to find ideas for Davidson’s new
Union.

The committee analyzed pros
and cons of Unions in Elon college,
Duke University, and Appalachian
State University.

Elon College had the newest
union of the three, as it is only one
year in operation.

The committee sited the large
student offices, as well as a more
visible book store and student mail
offices as positive aspects. The
union also had a good location, and
private dining rooms.

The group noted several nega-
tive characteristics of Elon’s Union,
including lack of storage space in

‘ the bookstore, and.other areas as

well. The union’s main center
seemed clogged, and the student

offices were closed off with twist-

ing corridors, making for awkward
traffic patterns.

Most importantly, the commit-
tee felt the union to be too fancy
and not friendly enough, acting as
more of a development building
than a student building.

Duke University’s Union was

built around 1980, and unlike the
Elon College, is comfortable with
fine theaters and semi-private
places in the midst of activity. The
union also has a large bookstore,
mail boxes, and a coffee shop. In
general the union was more casual
than the one in Elon.

However, the Committee felt
the offices were too open and
lacked character, and was simply
too big to serve as a good model for
Davidson.

The Committee found that
Appalachian State’s Union was
well planned out, with a good mix-
ture of both old and new elements.

There seemed to be heavy stu-
dent involvement in the planning

and good space for student organi-
zations. The Union holds a com-
puter room, fitness space, multi-
cultural. space, and is nearby to
gamerooms and pubs.

Much like with the Elon
Union, the Committee found that
the Appalachian State Union was
too cold, including the color
scheme of the building. The Com-
mittee also felt that the space for
student offices was unevenly dis-
tributed, giving too much space to
some organizations and not enough
to others.

Committee's notes on Site Visitations
in July, 1996,

Martin sees major improvements

from page 1

tions “are designed to improve re-
search instruction by providing a
lab-rich research and instructional
environment that promotes group
problem solving and research inde-
pendence.”

The report continues, “The
renovated research laboratories and
related prep, instrument and sup-
port spaces will facilitate more ef-
fective research and research train-
ing in Organic, Physical, and Ana-
lytical Chemistry.”

This reconstruction will also
provide more space for research

equipment and better ventilation,
and bring the entire building up to
current building codes.

The renovations are aimed
mostly for research facilities, but
they will facilitate both instruction
and research.

Along with the faculty in the
chemistry department, most chem-
istry students will profit from the
new facilities, more specifically,
students in a chemistry course or
doing independent study beyond
the freshman level.

Construction is set to begin
immediately after the spring se-

mester of 1997 and should not af-
fect students or faculty conducting
classes currently.

Desks and other laboratory in-
struments have been ordered and
will be moved in and installed dur-
ing construction which will take
place throughout the summer.

The facilities are scheduled to
be ready by the end of August in
time for the fall semester.

Dr. Carroll says he looks for-
ward to the renovations: “These
new facilities will be more suitable
for the research and experiment-
ing we anticipate for the future.”

Proposal suggests eliminating Humanities

from page 1

staff the Humanities course with
professors who are eager to teach
it.

“Our reasons for making the-
conjunction: [between eliminating
Humanities in favor of writing semi-
nars] were staffing concerns and
better teaching of writing,” says
Kaylor. |

Dr. Bob Manning, Professor
of Physics and Humanities, and the

Director of the Center for Interdis-
ciplinary Studies, had no comment
for the Davidsonian.

The EPC will discuss the pro-
posal once it has been read by all
EPC members. Any further action
on the proposal is “up to the EPC to
set in motion,” says Kaylor.

History and Humanities Pro-
fessor Dr. C.Earl Edmondson says
that “the Humanities program
should obviously be discussed from

time to time.”

However, he says he would
like to explore the possibility of “a
new type of approach that could
coexist with the Humanities pro-
gram.”

The four semester Humani-
ties course was introduced in the
mid 1960s. Today over 200 stu-
dents are enrolled in the course,
which spans students’ freshman
and sophomore years.
