my Award (Best Foreign
Film) winning. thriller, ‘*Z.”

The military regime. in
Greece is hard-hit target of
this adroit, suspenseful
film, created by artists whose
own lives were affected by
Greece's political: conflict. -

It is based on a novel by
Vassilis. Vassilikis and di-

Philips Speaks On Education Jan. 18

life segment of recent Greek

» history known as the Lam-

brakis affair.
‘Lambrakis, a professor of
medicine at the University
of Athens, was an articulate
spokesman for jiberal-paci-
fist causes.

On May 23, 1963, he .ap-
peared in the port city of
Salonika to preside over a
gathering of tthe Friends of
Peace to protest the deploy-
ment of Polaris missiles.
When he left the assembly,
he was run down by a three
wheel delivery
died three days later, hav-
ing never regained consci-
ousness.

The local police sloughed
it off as a regrettable inci-
dent.’ Lambrikis’ supporters
called it assassination.

Lambrikis’ autopsy reveal-
ed that death had not come
from being struck by . the
truck, but from a blow on

Grigorious

the head by a blunt weapon.

Undaunting examining and
re-examining of witnesses
disclosed a carefully plotted
assassination that implicat-
ed the government of Premi-
er Konstantinos Karamanlis.

The. government fell and
several leaders were jailed,
but after the military coup
d’ etalt in April 1967, five of
the imprisoned senior offi-
cers were<returned to their
duties.
Gavras has directed ‘‘Z”’
masterfully. His taut direc-
tion effectively follows the

plotting of the murder, the ;

assassination, and. the de-
nouement, leaving the audi-
ence limp and gasping.

The 1956-ish technique of
using music to heighten the
action is put to good effect
thanks ito the flavorful com-
positions of Theodorikis. The

A REVIEW

By CATHY ROSS
Staff Writer

The print works of Thom
Seawell ,are -hanging neatly
at Stowe Gallery. Seawell
has remarkable control of
the mechanical intricacies of
the printing processes; in-
terweaving colors and pat-
terns, he has put out a live-
ly series of prints.

There is a wide stretch to
his craftiness with his me-
dia. He has cleverly super-
imposed: .photographs and
experimented with textures
of papers and inks. Seawell
has done well in combining
techniques; the -woodcut
“Idaho” has particular suc-
cess in becoming ah etch-
ing at its interior.

camerawork of -‘Raoul Cou-
tord is powerful and_ rich,
capturing the mood. of  tur-
moil and conflict.

The acting is smooth and
well-coordinated as the fa-
miliar faces of the actors
blend into. the uniformity of
the film. Yves Montand is a
sympathetic pacifist leader
and Louis Trintignent is an
unswerving investigator.

Surprisingly, the
evokes a remarkable Gallic
atmosphere.’ The presence
of. Montand and Trintignent
is responsible. Also, the
film was made in Algiers.
Somehow ‘‘Z”’ loses some of
its mobility when the French
version. is dubbed into Eng-
lish.

What Gavras has done in
“Z" is to- create an exttreme-
ly subjective semi-documen-
tary. But it almost treads
on the rhetorical, Sometimes

his methods are too black

against whité: the good
guys — the honest, sincere,
liberal*. pacificts — against
the bad guys — the pom-
pous, slimy Fascists.

Fortunately, Gavras
makes no pretense at cloud-
ing the persuasive slant
of ‘Z."’ But couldn't the
Fascists make a movie as
persuasively anti - liberal,

Seawell Exhibits
Media Craftiness

The exhibit is a part of the

_Amercan Album: States and

Provinces, Monuments and
Momentos. It is to this pur-
pose that much of Seawell’s
work misses its potential.
The printer has labels,
words; or digits on almost
all his surfaces: ‘’Virginia,”
“Tenn.Ga. Line,’ ‘Ghost
Town,”’ “Yukon."’ The : let-
ters are often too purpose-
lessly obtrusive, turning
some of Seawell'’s prints in-
to distant cousins of the old
Orange Crush posters.
This is not to say the ex-
hibit is a failure. The north-
ern provinces are exception-
al prints: the colored wood-
cut of ‘‘Alaska’’ and silk
screens of ‘‘Alberta’’ and
‘Manitoba’ are superb.
Printing is a phenomenon
experiencing a metamorp-
hosis- of favor. Some consid-
er these media—etching, en-
graving, litho-graph, aquat-
int, woodcut—perfectly va-
lid modes of ‘rendering
works of art.’ j

But others view printing
as craft, requiring only skil-
led Jabor.

If your purpose is to con-
front this art-craft dilemma
facing modern print making,
it is questionable that Sea-
well's work will make ap-
parent any great turning
points in your consciousness.

But if you “haven't seen
Manitoba or the Yukon, you
can find happiness at the
Seawell show.
