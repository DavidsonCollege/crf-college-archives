The Association of American Colleges [AAC]. elected

Saturday.

Spencer was vice-chairman of the organization last year.

Delegates from the 610 member colleges and universities met
at the AAC’s annual convention in Denver, Colorado.

.Supported by membership dues and grants, this national
organization for liberal learning seeks to ‘‘enhance and promote
humane and liberating learning.”

The AAC aims at promoting liberal education to prospective
students, business, industry, and government.

As chairman, President Spencer will help guide the AAC’s
current program aimed at promoting public understanding of
the values of liberal education.

Other current AAC programs of concern to Spencer are the
simplification of federal grant procedures for member institu-
tions and a project on the status and education of women in
higher education.

Racism may cost South Carolina college

’

GREENVILLE, SC (CPS)—A
small fundamentalist college
here may lose its tax-exempt
status because it forbids inter-
racial dating or marriage on the
campus..

In the most recent develop-
ment in a decade-long battle
between Bob Jones University
and the federal government, the
U.S. Court of Appeals ruled
during the winter intersession
that the school’s prohibition of
interracial dating conflicted
with the nation’s ‘‘broad public
interest” in eliminating racial
discrimination. Consequently,
the college might have to start
paying federal taxes for the first
time.

Bob Jones started the battle
when it sued the federal govern-
ment to establish the principle
that it was not liable for paying
$21 in federal unemployment
taxes.

The government responded
with a counterclaim that the
four-year, non-accredited uni-
versity actually owed unem-
ployment taxes of nearly
$490,000 for 1971-1975.

The Internal Revenue Service
eventually joined the fray,
charging that Bob Jones was
ineligible for tax-exempt status.
The recent Appeals Court ruling
overturned an earlier U.S. Dis-
trict Court decision that the
IRS could not withdraw the
college’s tax exemption.

The Appeals Court ruling,
handed down in Richmond, Va.,
said the government should
“not be providing indirect sup-
port for any educational organi-
zation that discriminates on the
basis of race.”

Neither university founder
and current president Bob
Jones nor any school represen-
tative would comment on the
ruling.

But the head of another
fundamentalist school in a simi-
lar battle with the government
saw ominous trends in the court

The decision “‘is a definite
denial of constitutional and
human rights,’’ says Cark

proposals, said she is satisfied with the language competency.
‘it will get the language departments to improve their level of
teaching and it will ensure students get more from their
language classes,’’ Medlin said.
The EPC changed the math competency back to an area
requirement at the request of the math department, since it is

hard to define math competency, Medlin ‘noted.

Zimmermann said that some faculty members requested a
more specific definition of ‘‘basic course.’’ Individual depart-
ments, in conjunction with the EPC, will determine whi
courses will count as basic courses.

Biology Professor Cindy Grant said she thought the proposals
provided for a “balanced curriculum.” :

According to Walker, the proposals will ultimately be
approved. “The faculty will bring up questions concerning it,

but it will pass,” he said.
