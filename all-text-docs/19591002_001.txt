COUNCIL RESPONSIBILITIES
In their first session, Wed-

nesday, the group learned
about the Council and its re-
sponsibilities. After congratu-
lating them upon their election,
Mr. C. Shaw Smith informed
them that they would (1) repre-
sent their class to the College
family, (2) represent the Col-
lege in communicating with the
Freshmen, and (3) represent
the potential of the Class of
"63.

Mr. Smith challenged them
to realize this responsibility by

minded them, however, that
they had no power to put any
of their ideas into effect, ex-

that the faculty and student
leaders would be more than

Dr. Cumming Reveals

European Treasure

By CHARLES, ROSE

Davidsonian Feature

Editor

People who attend a class for fifty minutes three

times a week seldom have

the opportunity to see the

secret joys and accomplishments of the professor that

stands before them.

Time does not wait, the
course must be taught and the
professors extra _ activities
usually have to come out over
a cup of coffee or during some
Sunday night visit. Yet many
have written books, magazine
articles and chalked up scores
of other seldom known accomp-
lishments.

Professor William P. Cum-
ming sat near the window in
his book filled office slowly
packing his pipe. Shelves
reached the ceiling and a lad-
der rested near one corner.
“Now you wanted to know
about my trip to Europe,” he
said, bringing a flaming match
from the sole of his shoe. A
trip that took the professor and
his wife away from Davidson
for one year and eleven days,
over fourteen thousand miles

and through ten countries of
Europe.

“Before I get started, let me
show you something I brought
back,” he said reaching into his
back pocket and producing a
thin plastic billfold. From one
compartment he carefully re-
moved a small plastic box con-
taining a tiny black object.

“This is the smallest book in
the world,” said the professor
proudly holding it up for a
closer look. The minute. vol-
ume was covered in blue hand-
tooled morocco leather and
contained parts of the New
Testament in seven languages.

400 Join YMCA
In Large Increase

Over 400 Davidson students,
or about 45 per cent of the
student body, have joined the
YMCA this past week as a re-
sult of the membership and fi-
nancial drive, headed by Wes-

ley Weeks.

YMCA members are now con-
tacting each Davidson student
as a part of the financial drive,
and are receiving either cash
donations, or pledges to give
weekly at the vesper services.
It is hoped that the financial
drive will supply half of the
$4,600 budget for the YMCA’s
program.

.
;

The membership is greater
than last year, especially among
the freshmen. Last year 10 per
cent of the Freshman Class
joined, while 50 per cent joined
this year. The increase is main-
ly attributed to the change in
the time of the membership
drive, which was previously
held during orientation, but
was not conducted until after
Rush Week this year.

A special chapel program for
upperclassmen on the proposed
YMCA program is accredited
with the increase in member-
ship among the upper classes.
Thirty per cent of the Sopho-
more Class joined, 38 per cent
of the juniors, and 20 per cent
of the Senior Class.

Members are now being con-
tacted by the area chairmen of
the YMCA program, in the pro-
cess of getting the program un-

der way.

Week. This ruling was passed
to prevent any one fraternity
from continually occupying a
rushee’s room tor an entire aft-
ernoon. It will be a gentleman's
agreement among the fraterni-
ties to abide by this regulation.

During the last two days of
Rush Week, dorm rushing will
be limited to two hours in the
afternoon with no one fraterni-
ty occupying the room of a
rushee for more than _ thirty
minutes at any one time.

The idea of shortening the
pledging period on Saturday
afternoon was discussed, and
the council recommended that

ened thirty minutes and be

“There are three things that

that he will be an asset to the

“The procedure to obtain
this type of boy may change
but the philosophy remains
the same.

“For example—Three or four
years ago we could not find
enough boys academically qual-
ified to make up the freshgian
class. Therefore we did not pay
much attention to extra-curric-
ulars. The push came in filling
the last one hundred places in
the class with men of the cali-

Consequently, we now look

“But also the academic re-
quirements have risen, after
all, the primary reason for
the existence of a college is
academic.”

The Dean stated that he be-
lieved that the emphasis on the
scholastic was justified “since,”
he said, “we want to graduate
every boy that we admit. And
we feel that we are making
strides toward this goal.”

“As late as 1950 around forty
boys flunked out after each
semester. If the same rules had
been applied to the student on
campus last year, the number
would have only totaled four-
teen, only two of this number
being freshmen. -

out. However, in the present
class, there are no such stu-
dents that can be considered
doubtful.

“Also, we have raised the
academic standards in order to
be fair to the students apply-
ing.. It is unjust to take a stu-
dent that we feel can not make
the grade scholastically. Ten or
fifteen. years ago, the dean
could call up almost any school
in the south and place a boy
that had “flunked out” of Da-
vidson. Today this is impossible
since all schools are beginning
to take better and better stu-
dents.

“Since there are so many
qualified applicants, some
good boys will naturally be
turned down. However, the
best we can do is to make
our selections in accord with
our principles and hope that

Admissions Philosophy

(Editors note: Due to student unrest over the problem of admissions The DAVIDSON.
IAN last week initiated a series dealing with the subject in an interview with Dr. Martin.
This week the series continues with “The Philosophy of Admissions.” Next week the series
will conclude with “The Mechanics of Admissions.)

Assistant Dean H. Edmunds White this week confronted a DAVIDSONIAN staff

member with his views on the Davidson philoséphy admissions.

dents or future applicants by
