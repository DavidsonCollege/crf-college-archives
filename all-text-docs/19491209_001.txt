Troubadours To Give
Christmas Program

Dr. Watts is preparing his an-
nual Christmas chapel program for
December 19. He plans to have his
entire French classes participate
in the program, singing French
Christmas carols, with a special
group called the ‘“troubadours,” who
will sing special French hymns.

A feature will be the appearance
of Miss Peggy Ann Alderman of
Salem College, who will sing “I! est
me, le Divin Enfant.” The follow-
ing French students are members
of the “troubadours”: E. W. Fran-
cisco, H. W. Barr, H. E.. Coffin,
J. R. Keever, W. H. Cornelius, W.
W. Crymes, A. S. Joyner, G. B.
Brockenbrough, C. E. Calcote, L.
R. McGill, R. J. Boyd, M. C. Dou-
bles, W. B. Lord, J. D. Whitener,
R. E. W. Smith, H. P. Bridges, A.
S. Jones, A. T. Davies and Field-
ing Russell.

In addition to the chapel program
the “troubadours” are to partici-
pate in a French program at the
Mint Museum in Charlotte on Sun-
day afternoon, December 11, at
4:00 p. m. in order to add interest
to the collection of paintings by
French artists now being shown at
the Museum. A one act French
comedy, “Rosalie,” will be pre-
sented at the Mint under the direc-
tion of Dr. Watts with K. W. Jones
playing the part of Rosalie, W.
Goodman as Monsieur Bol and J.
R. Keever as Madame Bol, After
the program the “troubadours” and
the cast of “Rosalie” will be enter-
tained at a buffet supper at the
home of Mr. and Mrs. H. E. Cof-
fin, Sr., the former president of the
Mint Museum.

The custom of Dr. Watts’ teach-
ing his students Christmas carols
originated during the war when the
professor desired to teach better
his rather complacent students
French pronunciation. From this
point his classes have sung Christ-
mas carals at a chapel during the
Christmas season with the excep-
tion of last year.

Davidson's fraternities and Campus Club will sponsor the

third annual Christmas party for children of the Barium Springs
Orphanage on Friday, December 16. The entire grammar school,
one hundred sixty-five boys and girls between the ages of six
and twelve, will arrive in Davidson by bus at 7:30 P. M. Friday.

Representatives of each fraternity
and of the Campus Club will meet
the visitors at their arrival and will
direct them, in separate groups, to
the houses where they will be en-
tertained. Each organization will
be host to fifteen children.

A twinkling Christmas tree, most
probably, will be the center of in-
terest.a¢ every assemblage, and al-
though no message has heen re-
ceived from the North Pole, Santa
is expected to visit the children
while they are -on the Davidson
campus,

Barium Springs is located about
twelve miles north. of Mooresville,
North Carolina. It is a Presbyter-
ian orphanage and serves a large
area of the state, Davidson being
included in that area. Mr. Joseph
A. Johnson, a Davidson alumnus,
is the director of the institution.
The annual Barium Springs-Da-
vidson day was begun in December

Phi Society Hears
Charlotte Novelist

On Tuesday evening, December
6, the Philanthropic Literary So-
ciety had one of the South’s fead-
ing novelists, Miss Marian Simins,
of Charlotte, as its guest speaker.
Miss Sitnms commented briefly on
the publications at Davidson, point-
ing out that in her opinion they
were very good, and that the writ-
ing was of a collegiate level. There
were minor criticisms but, on the
whole she thought the publications
were good for the group for which
they are published.

Miss Simms went on to point
out the enjoyment as well as heart-
| aches in professional writing. When
| asked about writing f6r its own
sake and not for professional pur-
poses, she commented that at first
she thought it would be a lot of

trouble for nothing, but upon fur-
ther consideration, she would like

Dr. Godcharles Gives
Inter-Group Talks

@n December first, in the midst
ot fiis series of lectures to various
parents’ groups at the Myers Park
Zaptist Church in Charlotte, and
after speaking to the North Caro-
lina Banking Association on public |”
relations, Dr. Charles Godcharles
of the Davidson Psychology De-
partinent took some time out to
give another lecture. This time he
was addressing the Institution of
Inter-Group Relations held at the
Charlotte Women’s Club, and spon-
sored by the National Conference
of Christians and Jews.

In his. talk, “Facts vs Fancy,” he
brought -several specific points to
light which most of us overlook in
thinking of the problem of discrim-
ination: One, that the prejudices of
one froup towards another stem
from individual frustrations, and al-
though these prejudices may never
take the form of violence, we ex-
press them by-.passively “tolerating”
the minority group; Two, by ex-
hibiting these attitudes towards an-
other zroup, we tend to drive them
further into their shells, and there-
by kill any chances of their ever
assimilating “our” culture. In the}
long run this means that such
groups will cling even more tight-
ly to their own customs and ideal,,
thus giving us all the more rea-
son for discrimination; and Three,
that there is always a group within ,
the minority, usually a controlling |
growp, which stands to lose a lot of
power should discrimination tel
sectionalism cease.

After painting this somewhat sor: |
did picture, Dr. Godcharles went on
to note that by well designed focal
legislation, better training in the
schools with equal leadership ad-

to encourage writing for personal | vantages for all students, and by

enjoyment.

She deplored the fact that the
South produces no more of the top
ranking books than they do. Also,
she said that inany books receive
Jtop acclaim that are not worth it,
and overshadow many beautiful
and enjoyahle books that are being
published today. After her lecture a
short informal discussion period
foliowed, during which several

questions of literary interest were | chance

taken up.

inter-group conferences, much could
be solved. He pointed out, igow-
ever, that inter-group meetings
would be of littl use unless they
were held for the purpose of dis-
cussing a subject with a common
interest, and concluded that we
must’ try to. approach the subject
with open minds, that is, with a
sense of evaluation, keeping ever
awake and ready to . grasp any
of improvement which
inight afford itself.

ke members of the YMCA who
have come in contact with Stant-
Turner have learned to know a
man who truly exemplifies the “sec-

Stant Turner has spent thirty-
five years of his life in the Philip-
movement and is responsible more
‘than any other man for its develop-
|ment. His work has truly been
\ fruitful, for today the Y is the
rreatest character building: agency
in that countsy. During the last
war he was a constant friend to fis
Filipino friends even in the hard-
ships of torture. His underground
organization supplied food and med-
icine for Aimerican soldiery- in hid-
ing, until he was captured by the

Tof the war in the Santo Thomas

prison camp from which they were
liberated by a group «composed
mostly of Filipino guerrillas. Stant
Turner understands the Filipinos
and has gained their love and re-
spect more than any other Ameri-
can. Since the war he has made
several trips to the Philippines and
knows the need of these people.

Mr. Turner was born in Turner,
Iowa, He secured his B, A. from
Grinnel in 1911 and M. A, from
Oberlin College in 1914. His other
activities in Manila included hon-

orary L. L. D. degree from his alma

was voted the “outstanding living
exponent” of this institution.

The Hoilo Camp was in the di-
rect path of Japanese destruction
during the war and the entire plant
with all equipment was complete-
ly destroyed. The refurnished insti-
tution will serve underpriviledged
Filipino boys who lave missed the
blessings of a normal life since the
war. Suclt camps are scen as one
of the most productive program ac-
tivities in the building. of men of
Christian character,

It is estimated that equipment for
the Hoilo camp will require $7,-
500. ‘Phe amount that Davidson
gives will be supplemented by Y.
M. C. A: funds for reconstruction.
Furthermore this permarient camp
will be dedicated to the students of
Davidson College, with tio demand

;at all. placed upon the college to

continue material support.

There is a tremendous need in
the Philippines, especialiy at this
time, to establish again such boys
camps for rehibilitation and cor-
réction of the young bo;s who have
had their outlook and attitudes
warped so terribly during the war
years and the desolate period just
following the actual fighting, The
Y.M.C.A., more than all other
youth organizations combined has
had and still has the responsibility
of rehibilitating these youths to nor-
mal life. This camp at Iloilo and
others like it are to be in use
throughout the whole year of this
tropical country in such full-scale
programs as are organized to ins
struct the boys in the true and
Christian way of life. Hoilo is seen
as a strategic point of need.of such
an establishment because the re-
building of this camp would fur-
ish
00 with a alace fur year-round ac-
livities under -the guidance of de-
voted Y.M.C.A. d'-ectors.

The Y.M.C.A. Cabinet and com-
mittee after weeks af study were
unanimous in their choice of the
Hoilo Camp Proj*.t. Besides the
obvious nved which is so great in
the region. there is ‘another great
factor. The Philippines are strate-
gically located and its influence, as
the ‘only democratic country and
the only friend to American ideals
in the whole Asiatic area north of
Australia, is therefore tremendous.
The Philippines may be called on
to'he the first real stuinbling block
in the way of on-rushing militant
communism. In giving to an or-
ganization whose foundational pur-
pose is to build Christian charac-
ter in young men in the area, we
are helping to train future leaders
who will be directing the affairs of
‘his most strategically located. lit-
ule commonwealth.
