Cattes split games

-Few Davidson teams chal-
lenge other schools who are
loaded with scholarship players,
some coming from as far as
Poland. But Davidson gave
highly-touted Chapel Hill more
of achallenge than Carolina was
initially prepared for.

Davidson’s women were com-
ing back from a victory against
Pfeiffer College last Friday. It
was a well-played challenge in
which Davidson aimed to re-
deem itself after an unfortunate
loss to Pfeiffer last season,
_ The game began quickly with
an offensive rush and score by
Lisa Ballantyne. A second goal
came from co-captain Kirk
Cameron. This, however, left
the team with a 2-2 tie as the
clock ticked quickly through the

j second half.

» Then with 90 seconds remain-
ing, Ballantyne put in the
deciding goal—her second of
the game—to make it 3-2.

When that final whistle blew
there was a real sense of pride
beaming through all the players
and coaches. Comments like
“We came back,’ “It’s some-
thing you have to learn to do,”
and ‘“‘It feels great!’’ were
reflective of the joy in winning
such a close game.

Such was the optimism with
which the Wildcats entered the
game on Tuesday against Chap-
el Hill. For two-thirds of the
game, it was a true exhibition of
beautifully executed hockey.

Judging from comments on
the Carolina bench, Davidson’s

and the Tar Heels knew they
were in for a greater challenge
from Davidson than anticipa-

A lot of excitement is pent-up
for a game against a team like

all began to dwindle part way
into the second half.

With that letdown from Dav-
idson, the game turned around
and Carolina moved in to score
four definitive goals from the
left side of the field, before the
game ended.

So it was a hockey-filled week
at Davidson in which the team
is proving its improvement over
last season. In each game, a few
players have stood out.

In the Pfeiffer game, Barbie
Ashley and co-captain Ann
Clark both boostered the de-
fense and supported the offense
effectively. In the Carolina
game, Mary Gray Gilchrist and
Lisa Ballantyne exerted them-
selves all the way through.

Cats stun Keydets

By ROB GILLISON

When the Davidson Wildcats
take the field Saturday here
against Appalachian, they will
be carrying a modest one game
winning streak.

Last Friday the team travel-
led north to the Virginia Mili-
tary Institute. In what soccer

coach Karl Kremser calls, “‘the
best soccer I’ve seen since I’ve
been here at Davidson,”’ the

Cats came out with a 1-0
victory.

Better yet, they won a game
that was in several observers’
views, the best they had ever
seen VMI play. Better still,
that long awaited patience that
comes with experience is seem-
ingly beginning to surface.

The game was dominated by
Davidson through most of the
first half.

With a controlled passing
game they were able to reel off a
series of shots on goal.

But as the game wore on VMI
was able to mount a comeback.
Kremser wears a smile of satis-
faction at the thought. Instead
of panicing, falling out of
patterns and rushing bad pas-
ses, the team held together
under pressure and continued to
play well.

“This could be the turning
point,’’ muses Kremser. But
then he sobers when his
thoughts turn to Saturday’s
game.

Appalachian is ranked 15th
nationally and the coach thinks
they are better than that. He
draws a graphic analogy, ‘This
is like (the football team) play-
ing Ohio State.”

Oh, well...let’s look at it as
just so much more expensive.
