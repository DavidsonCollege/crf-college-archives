College Welcomes
Several Professors
This Semester

By Jeff Revis

There are several new addi-
tions to the Davidson faculty this
semester. Along with various vis-
iting professors, two full time as-
sistant professors have joined the
college community, Religion Pro-
fessor Lynn Poland and Sociology
Professor Janet Shannon.

Dr. Poland received her A.B.
from Bates and then moved on to

the University of Chicago for her -

M.A, and Ph.D in Religion. Her
specialty is gender studies i in reli-
gion.

This semester, she will- be
teaching classes in the General
Rubrick Religion in Literature,
Gender and €hristianity, Autobi-
ography in Religion, and a Senior
Seminar in Religion. Next year,
Dr. Poland will become a member
of the Humanities Program.

A great fascination for and
commitment to her field of study
are exhibited in Dr. Poland. She
attempts to convey this to her stu-
dents throughaheavy emphasise on
discussion.

ifhetagtedacbesion: sebones
to teach students “ways of formu-
lating questions and reading texts
which are different from other
disciplines.”

She’ encourages her students
to “be passionate about something”
they enjoy and “not to be afraid of
making mistakes”. Travel, fixing
up old houses, and modern dance

are some of the things that Dr.-

Poland enjoys doing in her spare
time. Le

A welcome addition to the
Sociology Department, Ms, Shan-

Temple University. She is cur-
rently working omher dissertation
which explores a Black commu-
nity outside of Philadelphia from
1790-1850. Her specialty. is Pre-
Civil War Communities in the
North. She has classes in Urban

‘Sociology, Raceand Ethnicity, and

independent studies whichinvolvye
the role of black women at
Davidson and interracial churches.

On top ofall this, Ms. Shannon
is the mother of two. She enjoys
collecting antiquities, knitting, and
spending time with her children
when not working on her disserta-
tion.

Sheis very interested in “arous-
ing the curiosity of her students”.

-A longtime student as well as a

mother, Ms. Shannon is still very
familiar with the student experi-
ence and feels that she “can empa-
thize with students”.

She tries to make her classes

interesting by showing how much

there is to seein the world and how
“fascinating they are when viewed
through a sociological perspec-

tive”, If anything, she would like”

to“‘developan awareness” in those
who take: her classes.
Her advice to students is to
pursue the doctoral degree if pos-
sible. “Despite the hard work and

pain,” shesays, “the graduate proc-

ess teaches. self-discipline and is
an accomplishment which is com-

pletely yours”. Besides enriching

the lives of those who attain it, the
degree i 1S also becoming eoeReary
in society.

The motivation and euilinsl: #

asm of each teacher, coupled sh

non received her B.S. from Saint
Joseph’s and her M.A. and soon to
bereceived (in March) Ab.D from

theirknowledge and ab sho
make them important additions to
the Davidson faculty.

Joe Binns| Music Review
Allmans Offer Sweet Dreams

The Allman Brothers Band
Dreams
4 Compact Disc Compilation
Polydor

Guess what Joe B. got for
Christmas? That’s right Dreams
and sweet ones at that. I’ve got
four CD’s loaded with tunes by the
Allman’s and Allman’s spinoffs,
i.e. The Gregg Allman Band, Dicky
Betts and Great Southern, Allman
and Woman, The31stof February,
The Second Coming, Hour Glass,
and, of course, The Allman Joys.

In addition their are tunes from
the solo efforts of Dicky, Gregg
and Duane. The compilation gives
me a chance to write favorably
about one of my favorite bands
after that hideously: harsh review
of their weak effort, Seven Turns.

Without hesitation I will call
the compilation successful and well
done. The three hundred minutes
of music evoke every emotion their
albums have with two exceptions.
Niether could have been helped.

The exhaustive disorientation
and unfettered awe one feels after
“Mountain Jam” is missing but if
included it would’ ve taken up half
a disk (listen to sidé B of Ludlow

Garage). Also left unmarked on
the emotional checklist is the one
felt upon first hearing the Allmans
and this, of course, could not have
been reproduced.

But that arresting happy mel-
lowness which soothingly enve-
lopesoneis inescapable. Youcan’t
shake it (as if you’d wantto). When
listening, itis present-- regardless
of whatever other Allman-induced
sensations are controlling your
body (which is, by the way, only a
helpless receptor subject to the
whims of every individual tune).

The only disappointments for
me were the exclusion of “Please
Call Home,” off Idlewild South,

and Gregg’s soulful groaning |

therein, and the choice of the
“Whipping Post” off At Fillmore
East. Its justtoo slow and shortand
I’ve heard that any “Post” from
this past summer’s tour could
smoke it.

The high points on Dreams are
too numerous to mention. Come
by and we’ll listen toa couple. But
if you have the cash to lay out
believe me when I say that Santa
did me extremely right.

Short Show Review
Allgood. New Year’s Eve. The

Cotton Club in Auianta

Its too late to review Blues
Traveler’s Johnston Gym perform-
ance on December 8th but seein’
as how you were all there you all
now how good it was. Extremely.

But I saw a good one over the
break. Allgood, who has graced
our campus on several occasions
was blistering. They ran through a
set of about fourteen songs, all
good. No “Post,” no Wet Willie,
but the closer, “Trilogy”>”Funky
House,” took the sting off Wide-
spread Panic’s first number.

The criticism of Allgood is that
if they goby a name so close to the
Allmans’, and play Allmans cov-
ers and Allmans sounding tunes
they needa pair of wizards playing
guitar. I disagree, with the charge
that Clay and John aren’t scorch-
ing that is. They proved their indi-
vidual worth to the crowd at the
Cotton Club lead after lead and
they are even better as a team.

Corky and his pals are in the
studio now so look for the first
Allgood album to be out in Febru-

ary.

While looking for work, Dr.

also became its chair of Women’s
Studies.

In the tenth year of her teach-

Tong’s husband died of a heart

major reason for Tong’s decision
to.take a sabbatical to Davidson.

She arrived in Davidson as a

Davidson College persuaded
her to stay by suggesting she work
on the solidification of the Medi-
cal Humaities Program.

“As much as I enjoy writing
and research”, says Tong, “I still
prefer teaching and that’s harder to
indulge at a university level, so I
accepted the offer to build the
program with my colleagues Drs.
Case, Stell, Williamson, Kimmel
and Maloney.”

Tong loves “the spirit of com-
munity and service here,” and she
feels that by teaching high-caliber
students, she is “really contribut-
ing to the future leaders of Amer-
ica.”

to pull out a machine-gun to gun

All in all, everyone should
probably enjoy this film simply
because it delivers an important

The film ends on a similar bitter-
sweet note to its predecessor Big

In the words of that great, om-
