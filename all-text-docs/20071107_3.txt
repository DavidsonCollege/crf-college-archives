Day of the Dead alive
and well on campus

By JORDAN WALL
Senior Staff Writer

Last Thursday, students gathered in
Chamber’s Lilly Gallery for the
Organization of Latin American Students’
(OLAS) annual celebration of the Day of the
Dead, or Dia de los Muertos.

In conjunction with the Spanish
Department, members of OLAS gave a pres-
entation detailing the history and signifi-
cance of the day.

The presentation also included several
live performances by students and one pre-
viously recorded performance by Professor
of Spanish Carlos Rivera.

“The holiday is over 3,000 years
old and indigenous to groups like
the Olmec and Zapotec tribes. The
holiday was assimilated with the
concept of All Saint’s Day and All
Soul’s Day.”

Juan Ramirez °08, President of OLAS,
began the festivities with a PowerPoint pres-
entation on the Day of the Dead. Ramirez,
who is originally from Mexico, spoke of the
holiday’s cultural significance and the man-
ner in which it is celebrated in Mexico. Food
is prepared for deceased friends and family
who are believed to return to the living
world for one day.

Altars are traditionally arranged in the
home with pictures of the deceased. Family
members also make decorations such as

skulls made of sugar. OLAS created its own
traditional altar in the gallery for people to
process by.

The holiday is over 3,000 years old and
indigenous to groups like the Olmec and
Zapotec tribes.

The influx of Christianity to Mexico,
assimilated the holiday with the concept of
All Saints Day, held on Nov. 1, and All Souls
Day, held on Nov. 2.

Many of the original sentiments of the hol-
iday have remained. Ramirez explained that
one purpose of the holiday is to show mas-
tery over death. A common phrase, Ramirez
said is “la muerte es flaca y no puede conmi-
go,” meaning, “death is skinny and cannot
handle me.”

Several students performed live pieces,
most of which were related in sentiment to
the day itself rather than traditional perform-
ances.

Among them was Jenny Geyer ’09, who
read a poem by Julie Sopetra, titled, “Woman
with a Somber Gaze.”

David Dennis’s (08) rap performance had
the crowd up on its feet dancing, and Rivera
donned a mask-as the symbol of death for his
pre-recorded performance of the “Invocation
of Death,” entirely in Spanish.

The event concluded with the group’s pro-
cession to a graveyard on the outskirts of the
campus.

Carrying candles, the group moved
through the graveyard honoring the deceased
by placing flowers onto their gravestones.

The night ended with several prayers
offered in memoriam and a few songs to
raise the attendants’ spirits.

SGA approves emergency allocations

By Kate GILLESPIE
Staff Writer

At last Thursday’s Student Government
Association (SGA) meeting, senators voted
on an emergency Activity Tax Council
(ATC) allocation and nominated students to
study groups that will determine future col-
lege strategy.

The vote on the ATC allocations was prob-
lematic because SGA was two senators short
of the two-thirds quorum needed to approve
resolutions.

Nevertheless, ATC chair Will DeLoache
709 presented the proposals. The
Environmental Action Committee (EAC)
had asked for an allocation from the ATC to
send 50 people to the Power Shift
Conference in Washington, D.C. The ATC
had initially decided to cover lodging and
half of the transportation costs. From the

time of this initial allocation, the number of:

students going to the conference dropped to
20. The EAC consequently decided to car-
pool to the conference rather than taking
chartered buses.

Total costs for the trip to the conference
came to $15,000. Since student participants
had already paid a $45 registration fee, the
EAC asked the ATC to provide $5,000 to
cover the remaining costs.

Those present voted on an allocation for
the Power Shift Conference on global warm-
ing because student participants were leav-
ing the following day and needed to know if
they would need to contribute their own
money to fund the trip. To meet the quorum,
Darrell Scott ’10 and Robert Lassiter *09
voted via cell phone.

The allocation passed.

DeLoache also presented a proposal to
allocate money to Davidson Outdoors (DO)
for anew TV and DVD player.

In the fall, DO had asked for money for the
TV so members could watch instructional
films and kayaking video.

The ATC asked DO to search around the
college for other available TVs. Since DO
could not find any other TVs, members
renewed their proposal for an allocation
from the ATC.

SGA also selected students to serve on the
strategic planning committees formed by
President Tom Ross and members of the
Principal Executive Staff. Two students,
along with trustees and faculty members,

will be part of each of the five groups.

Although many senators were eager to
nominate students with experiences that
qualified them to serve on the committees,
Treasurer Blake Poole ’08 urged senators to
remember their mission.

“This is about representing students,”
Poole said. “It’s more important who these
[nominated] students are. You should think
about it in terms of who you would want to
represent students.”

SGA began with the Demographics Study
Group, which will examine the effect of
national demographic changes on the
Davidson campus. Dean of Admissions
Chris Gruber heads this group. Senators
selected Katie Hunter ’08 and Darrell Scott
10, both of whom have dealt with demo-
graphic statistics through their majors, polit-
ical science, and sociology, respectively.

Senators then chose Lauren Woodall ’08
and Austin Bell ’10 to serve in the Regional
Change Study Group. Dean of Students Tom
Shandley and Eileen Keeley are in charge of
this group, which will explore the conse-
quences for the Town of Davidson of the
expansion of Charlotte and other changes in
the Southeast region of the US. .

Arthur Etchells ’08 and Meikayla
Zwieryznski ’10 were nominated to the
Trends in Liberal Arts Education Group
headed by Dean of Faculty Clark Ross.

Senators chose Meena Sangar *10 and
Mike Wellman ’08 to study how changes in
the global economy will affect Davidson.
Director of Athletics Jim Murphy leads the
Globalization Study Group.

The last study group was the Technology
Study Group led by Vice President for
Business: and Finance Karen Goldstein.
Senators nominated JD Mills ’09 and Aaron
Couch ’09.

Each of these groups will meet three times
before the end of the year and will aid in pro-
ducing a written report for the Trustee
Retreat on Feb. | of next year.

The meeting also included a follow-up
from Katie Hunter ’08 on last week’s EAC
meeting, which several senators attended.

SGA is studying environmental issues this
month as a part of the Real Talk Project.

Hunter and EAC member Katie Epstein
”10 are currently working with the coordina-
tor of Davidson 101 to institute an environ-
mental policy forum as part of the program
for freshmen.
