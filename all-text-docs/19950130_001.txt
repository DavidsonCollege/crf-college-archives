Snow covered the campus on Monday; January 23. Though novel
and serene for most of the morning, the snow turned into a wet
mess by afternoon. Luckily the flurry did not deter classes or
cause any major accidents.

Will funding cuts mark the demise of
our community public radio stations?

By Bryan Allison

Since the federal government
has run an immense deficit in
spending, Republicans have re-
newed the effort to balance the
budget. With the significant
amount of new blood in Congress,
cuts in many areas are being pro-
posed. Elimination of federal fund-
ing for public broadcasting has
been targeted as one of these spend-
ing cuts.

Licensed to Davidson College,
WDA V (Classical 89.9 FM), which
draws 26% of its budget from the
U.S. government this year, is one
of numerous public radio and TV
stations that has much to lose if this
funding is no longer provided.

WDAYV station manager John
Clark says, “The system has
worked well here for 25 years. It
would be a shame to cut things that

in the long term may do more harm
than good.”

The system that Clark refers
to is a federal-local partnership
that the government has provided
through the CPB, the Corporation
for Public Broadcasting. WDAV
does not answer to Congress or the
CPB; it is locally controlled and
draws most of its support from the
surrounding area. It represents
community interests, and its com-
mits many hours of free air time to
encourage the local ‘arts.

But the fight is not over yet. A
task force comprised of WDAV,
WFAE, and WTVI (Channel 42)
recently sent letters to over 22,000
of their supporters, urging them to
write their local congressmen.

Sorority strife causes
Panhellenic face-off

By Carrie Blackburn & Kerry Albright
A discussion of sororities joining Patterson

- Court turned into a tense face-off when repre-

sentatives of the National Panhellenic Council
and students from Wake Forest University and
Presbyterian College addressed an audience
about the benefits of sisterhood.

On January 24, members of Zeta Tau Al-
pha, Chi Omega, and Alpha Delta Pi chapters
tried to dispel several stereotypes associated
with sororities, such as high costs, lack of
academic achievement, and hazing.

The speakers also tried to de-emphasize
the rushing process by calling it “mutual selec-
tion.” They described “mutual selection” as a
match-up process in which women find which
house best suits them and houses find rushees
which best suit the house.

According to the panel, some advantages
of sororities over eating houses include stron-
ger bonds of friendship during college and
networking opportunities for jobs in the future.

Beth Mannle, the Grand National Presi-
dent of Alpha Delta Pi, stressed the far-reach-
ing ties of sisterhood. She cited anecdotal
experiences about sisters helping her on mov-
ing day, recommending the best doctors in her
new town and writing over 300 letters to her son

during the Gulf War.. She says, ““No matter...

where we went to:school, we’re sisters; that
commitment lasts a lifetime.”

Sophomore Barbara Harvey set up the
forum because of her favorable experience last
semester as a transfer at Georgia Tech where
she pledged Zeta Tau Alpha. At the meeting
her enthusiasm about this issue was obvious as

she said, “I really believe in this system.”

A member of Rusk, Harvey says she has
nothing against eating houses, but she found
that sororities offer women many more oppor-
tunities similar to those enjoyed by fraternities.
She feels that Patterson Court is almost dis-
criminatory because eating houses are not
equivalent to fraternities. Harvey says, “Guys
have more personal bonds than we do.”

Junior Rachael Tripi, areturning Davidson
student, echoed such sentiments about her time
at Lehigh University where she pledged a so-
rority. She thinks sororities would help “make
us more equal with men because they have
fraternities.”

Tripi discussed the possibility of structur-
ally changing the eating houses as another
option for strengthening the sense of commu-
nity among women because within her soror- ’
ity, they “were just like family.”

Allison Good and Chrissie Hudson, mem-
bers of Connor House, voiced many women’s
fears of losing the uniqueness of our self-
selection process. They agree that sororities
are important at larger schools but do not see
the need for them on Davidson’s smaller cam-
pus of only about 800 women.

_ Tohelp mitigate the crowd’s anxieties, the

roritiescan takeon individual campuses. Cathy
Slaughter, Vice President of scholarship for the
foundation for Zeta, said, “There is no set limit
to the number of women who could join a
sorority, and we would help you decide how big

Watt, says,“In the past week we
have received letters an inch thick
that were overwhelmingly in favor
of continuing federal funding for
public broadcasting. Supporters
of public broadcasting have been
very active on the Hill.”

A hearing on January 19 held
by the Subcommittee of Labor and
Health and Human Services
brought good news for those op-
posed to the elimination of fund-
ing for public broadcasting. A
number of Republicans proposed

to phase out support over a five
year period, which would prevent
immediate cuts from taking effect.
It would also buy public stations
valuable time to build support and,
if necessary, to better adjust to the
reduction.

Clark hopes that some sort of
compromise can be reached. He
says, “Every program should do its
part to cut spending. We are hop-
ing to prevent total elimination of
