Dr. Snell Gives Two
Interesting Addresses

Speaks to Y. M. C. A. and to Med-
ical Clab of Work in China.

Dr. Snell, who is at home on furlough
from the mission fields of China, gave a
very interesting and beneficial talk to the
Y. M. C. A. last Thursday night on mis-
sion study.

Dr. Snell brought out the fact that
the world is in great need of a broader
knowledge of missions. He said that in
order for a person to have a liberal edu-
cation he must have a knowledge of mis-
sions. The business man as well as all
other men should take an interest in and
hear more about the work in the mis-
sion fields.

‘The further statement was made that

the studying of missions is the studying
of the Kingdom of God, and that it is
a Christian's duty and privilege to study
and learn of God's work in the home
and foreign fields. giving in this connec-
tion testimonials of a number of Y, M.
C. A. supporters as to the usefulness and
necessity of mission study.

Dr. Snell, while in this country is de-
voting his time to giving these lectures in
behalf of the work in the foreign fields.
The meeting here was largely attended.

Dr. Snell also met with the Volunteer
Band twice and gave them interesting
talks.

On Friday night he gave a very inter-
esting talk to the Medical Club. The
time was.taken up mainly with the dis-
cussion of how the medical work was
carried on in China. Diseases are vers
prevalent in China, particularly intesti-
nal diseases. which have to be fought
vigorously by the physicians.

Snell showed that the work

China is not at all distasteful, as some
might imagine. but is carried on very
much as it is in America today. The
hardships connected with the medical
life there are very few, as compared with
those of the American doctor who sets
out to practice medicine in this country
with everything against him. Here, in
fact, the older doctors of the community
are jealous of the voung practitioner, and
seek rather to discourage him than to
help him along. In China none of this
is found, and the opportunity is many
times greater for doing a noble work.
The ideal of “The Great Physician” can
be more nearly ‘realized in that country
than in America.

Dr. Snell closed his address with an
appeal for medical missionaries to go
out under the Rockefeller Foundation
Fund to aid in the work. in China.

SOPH BANQUET PLANS.

A meeting of the Soph class was held
Saturday afternoon for the purpose of
discussing plans for the Soph Banquet.
Several short speeches were made by dif-
ferent members of the class. setting forth
the importance of the hanquet and urg-
ing all the members to be present. Out
of about 60 members present 58 signi-
fied their intention of going.

R. B. McKee. the manager. stated
that he had not definitely decided where.
in Charlotte, the banquet should be held,
but that it would probably be at the
Mecklenburg or the Selwyn hotel.

Varsity Five Loses to

Elon; Defeats A. & M.

First Contest Close Till Last Min-
utes of Play.

ELON GAME.

In a hard fought game last Tuesday
night Davidson was defeated by the
Elon quintet on the home floor by a
score of 25 to. 17. From the first whis-
tle to the end the playing was fast and
furious. Davidson's defeat lay in her
inability to shoot foul goals.

The first half was characterized by
brilliant playing on both sides and ended
with a score of 12-12.

The second half was a series of fouls
for both sides, but of the 19 attempts, R.
T. Bradfield for Elon secured 13 goals,
whereas Davidson shot only 3 out of 13
attempts. For Davidson, King, and for
Elon, Bradford and Beard, did stellar
work.

A large crowd witnessed the game.

THE A. AND M. GAME.

Coach Kluttz and his aggregation of
basket ball tossers journeyed down ‘to
Charlotte Friday and added another
game to the list of Davidson victories.
trouncing North Carolina A. and M., of
Raleigh, 30 to 18. With the whirlwind
floor work for which they are noted and
with the hitherto somewhat dimmed
shooting eyes again in working trim, the
Davidson quintet literally rushed the A.
and M. five off their feet, and had the
game well in hand at all times. At the
opening of the first half, the Raleigh lads
gave promise of a close and interesting
game, neither side being able to cage the
ball until ten minutes of play had passed.
Then the Red and Black machine got
its joints unkinked, and the fireworks
started. Childs made the first goal, and

from that moments points followed fast!

—for Davidson. The Aggies totaled one
point in this half, while Daidson made
eleven. The second half was a better ex-
hibition all around. With much of the
rough work climinated, the two teams
fought hard, the score for the half being
19 to 17, in favor of the Presbyterians.

Captain Reese and Childs were the
individual stars for Davidson, though it
would be hard to overlook the work of
the other three men when listing the
luminaries. The whole team played
stellar ball. For A. and M., Johnson
and Dowd were the stars.

DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C.. JANUARY 26, 1916.

Interesting Lecture

Delivered by Dr. Sledd

Professor of English at Wake For-
est Speaks About Travels.

The college has been very fortunate
in securing a number of able, interesting
speakers to deliver lectures to the stu.
dents this vear. The first of these was
the one delivered by Dr. Sledd, of the
English department of Wake Forest
College, last Friday night, on his recent
travels in Europe.

The lecture was humorous, interesting
and at the same time instructive. His
purpose was to give his audience an in-
sight into the character of the European
peaples with whom he came in contact
rather than the beauties of the countries
themselves. He was not pessimistic in
his views, nor was he over. optimistic, but
gave the general facts just as they were.

He arrived in Ireland before the war
started, when the Home Rule question
was about to throw Great Britain into
a civil war. He told in a most impres-
sive way about the Irish and their
troubles with England. ‘Phen he went
to England and Scotland, and was in
thase countries when the~ great) war
broke out. He gave ‘Frade Rivalry”
as Great Britain's: motive for going into
the war. He contrasted the British,
French and Italians, describing the Brit-
ish people as a fearless, cool, unemo-
tional and = staunch people, and the
French and Htalians as an artistic, emo-
tional, fickle and sensational people.

After visiting Italy Dr. Sledd went to
Greece. where he was very much im
pressed with the art, architecture and the
old myth-famed places of that country.

A little over a year ago Dr. Sledd was
elected a Fellow in the Kahn Founda
tion, this distinction carrying with it che
sum of $3,000 to be used in foreizn
travel and study, and it was of this trip
that he Jectured.

On Friday evening Mrs. Dr. Martin
entertained at an informal dinner for
Dr. Sledd, the other guests being Dr.
and Mrs. Lingle and Dr. and Mrs.
Fulton.

game by kicking off to Fowle, who. re-
turned 10 yards. ‘The Sophs failed to
gain and Fowle punted. D. Shaw, drop-
ping back to his 3-vard line to punt,
fumbled, and the Sophs recavered. The
Seniors braced and held for downs.
Quarter ended.

In the second quarter Therrell, of the
Sophs, tried for a field goal, but failed.
The remainder of the quarter was given
over to exchanges of punts,

The third quarter was a repetition of
the second, neither side being able to
gain consistently. Sparrow made a nice
run of 15 yards, one of the longest of
the game.

In the fourth quarter Worth made
two runs of 30 and 10 yards cach, which
placed the balt on the 15 yard line.
Here the Seniors held and the game
ended shortly after.

the Seniors, while, Worth, Richardson,

Fresh, while Porter did the best work
for the Juniors.

First quarter: The Juniors kicked
off to the Fresh. Neither team was able
to score. However, the Juniors threat-
ened when they ‘barely missed a_ place
kick from the 30-vard line.

Second quarter: ‘The first part was
an exchange of punts, but later the Jun-
iors advanced to the 20 vard line. Here
Alford failed to drop kick.

again. Neither side could gain, and aft-
