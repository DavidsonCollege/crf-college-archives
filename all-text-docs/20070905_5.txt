SCULPTURE GARDEN USHERS DAVIDSON INTO
AGE OF ENLIGHTENMENT

When the time comes for the
final reckoning of Bobby Vagt’s
tenure, historians will agree on one
glaring shortcoming: he could
never manage to establish the elu-
sive, flourishing seulpture garden
that President Ross has now culti-
vated in his first few weeks in
office.

This giant rubber eraser, which
symbolizes the transcendence of
the ego, is reputed to be the next
target of Sculpture Garden cura-
tor Bud Kowalski.

Early Tuesday night, thousands
flocked to an opening for what
Tammy O’ Hara ‘09 referred to as a
place “holier than the Garden of
Eden.” It was the grand opening
for the new sculpture garden and
nearly every member of the town
of Davidson was in attendance.

As Dean Mandlebaum said,
“The newly realized courtyard will
possess a vibrancy all its own in
that it will exercise the intellect,
spirit, and imagination, while
simultaneously engaging each stu-
dent’s formal identity.”

Mandlebaum expects the gar-
den to increase application rates by
35%. Additionally, tour guides
have been instructed to circle the
garden thrice to represent it’s
“three-fold symmetry of purpose.”

Spirits were high as a fruitful
ambience accompanied the numer-
ous speeches delivered at the gar-
den’s opening. There was talk of
the garden representing a rebirth of
the college, as well as a.
Renaissance feeling that restored
the campus to its golden days.
Once the event concluded at 10pm
with an elaborate fireworks dis-
play, students, faulty, and towns-
people returned to their prior obli-
gations with a fresh sense of pur-
pose.

Davidson College’s endow-
ment has been set to fund mainte-
nance for the garden with a gener-
ous annual $2.5 million dollar
grant.

The garden is tended to by 35
horticulturists who prune and
hedge the sculptures four times a
day. Additionally, the water pres-
sure in the library bathrooms has

been decreased so that the sprin-
Klers can sufficiently reach each
one of the sculptures adequately.

Home and Garden Television
correspondent,Bill
Filipenmanjaropu, flew in from
Davis, California for the event.

“There are only a few opportu-
nities this big that come your way
when you’re in the garden busi-
ness. I simply could not pass this
one up.”

He also provided much needed
clarification as to how many pieces
are required to constitute a garden.

Andrew Gormley’s creepily titled
“You,” the Peeping Tom of the
Sculpture Garden.

“TI have heard a few skeptics
suggesting that this somehow does
not constitute a garden due to the
relative lack of pieces on display.
This could not possibly be further
from the truth. This year’s

MISOGYNY REPLACES ANDROGYNY

Last night a packed Union 900
room witnessed the debut of
Davidson’s latest a capella third
wheel, Misogyny. The group,
consisting of eleven male upper-
classmen all hailing from below
the Mason-Dixon Line, formed in
the void of Androgyny, Davidson’s
unisex vocal ensemble that implod-
ed last spring in a mire of scandal
and intrigue.

“That Androgyny shit was never
going to last,” said Misogyny front
man Rex Rose. “You know why?
Too much estrogen. They didn’t
have no one to cook their meals,
man. The womenfolk was always
crooning some Weather Girls bull-
shit instead of battering up a good
turkey. Why do you _ think
Fleetwood Mac broke up? Ali the
bitches, man.”

In one of the more controversial
vocal debuts in Davidson history,
Misogyny opened their inaugural
concert with a violent rendition of
Guns N Roses’ “Back Off Bitch,”
followed by AC/DC’s “Let Me Put
My Love into you, Babe” and
Black Sabbath’s “Evil Woman.”
Then came an eleven-minute hom-

age to Misogyny icon Ted Nugent,
the most memorable lyric of which
was surely, “Hey, Madeline

Albright, Kiss My Glock.”

Misogyny on their ill-fated debut,
minutes away from being written
up.

After an intermission of back-
stage cigarettes and whiskey pulls,
Misogyny returned to the mic with
the request that all women in the
audience leave for the second half
of the show.

Visibly inebriated, they proceed-
ed to butcher the Eagles’ “Witchy
Woman,” before attempting their
most experimental number. As his
tenors hummed the operatic
melody of Wagner’s
“Liebesverbot,” front man Rex

Rose began beat-boxing that
catchy Prodigy number, “Smack
my Bitch Up.”

After perhaps 30 seconds of this,
campus police arrived and those
Misogyny members who had not
already passed out were escorted
from the stage.

“Why do you think
Fleetwood Mac broke
up? All the bitches,

I?

man.

Misogyny issued a press release
this morning saying that they
refused to apologize, and that they
would continue promoting their
hard-rocking agenda of bigotry,
prejudice, and the intolerance of
women’s rights (excepting those of
their groupies, who are permitted
Cat card access to their Jamieson
apartment).

Rose also warned the student
body of Misogyny’s imminent
return.

“First Night Down, man. We’re
opening at Pika for Twisted Sister.
It’s gunna be a bitchin’ good time.”

clearly state that two or more
things within 100 feet of each other
constitute a garden. The sculpture
garden at Davidson has easily out-
performed that minimum require-
ment with three items on display.

Sculpture garden
(skulpcher gartan]
noun

1 Any plot of land
with two or more

things within 100 feet
of each other.

2 A plot of land
that arbitrarily takes
on trancendentalist
meaning on certain
liberal arts campuses.
