The Class of 2003 has arrived

COLLEGE COMMUNICATIONS

Davidson's Class of 2003 began classes on
Monday, August 23, well-prepared for the culture
they joined through four days of orientation activi-
ties. Besides meeting each other, the 458 first-year
students were introduced in whirlwind fashion to
more administrators, faculty members, extracur-
ricular opportunities, and academic programs than
they could ever be expected to remember.

But the orientation overview also gave them
grounding in the core values of the college they
will share, and gave them a first common experi-
ence on which they can begin to build friendships
and trust. Davidson’ s orientation is far more exten-
sive than that offered by most colleges and univer-
sities, giving entering students an extended chance
to bond as hallmates and classmates before
upperclass students return to campus. It gives
parents a full day-and-a-half to learn about what
their students will experience at Davidson, and it
gives students ample time to become comfortable
in their surroundings before classes begin.

While first-year international and minority
students, and student residence life staffers, came
together for special orientation sessions up to four
days earlier, Orientation 1999 officially began
Thursday, August 19. Coming together from 40
different American states and 21 foreign coun-
tries, members of the Class of 2003 lined up
outside the College Union that morning to run an
initial gantlet of stations both serious and silly. In
addition to receiving their “Cat” identification
cards, laundry numbers, and student employment
assignments, they donned costumes for a photo,
took the freshman juggling test, and received their
first Davidson “kiss” (a Hershey’s kiss, that is!).

A large corps of upperclass “Orientation

Team” members was on hand at the residence
halls to help them haul their luggage to their new
rooms. Students assigned to the upper floors of
the residence halls especially appreciated the as-
sistance!
