‘eminars Experimen’
1 Liberal Education

Wednesday. at 3:45 p.m. a group
of students and faculty met for
the last regular session of the
“Interdepartmental Seminar.”

During the past year this group
has been meeting every other
week in order to explore the pos-
sibility of tying together a liberal
arts education more effectually.

The basic assumption of the
group was that Davidson provides

pja good set of basic courses, bul

that the student needs help in
bringing all of this experience
and material together into some
sort of meaningful whole.

During the fall the focus of at-
tention was ‘upon the = social
sciences, set against the back-
ground of the humanities.

In October psychology and soei-
ology were used to answer the
question:: “What do the social

_ | sciences provide as a basie view

of human nature?”

In November economics and
political science were used to
“What do
the social sciences have to say
about the present situation of
modern man?”

In December history and philos-
ophy were brought in to begin
asking the question: “In what
ways is modern man coping with
Professors Bevan,
McAfee, Ratliff. Morton, Mar-
rotte, and Ford led the sessions
in the fall.

During the spring the focus has
been upon the humanities. set
against the background of the
social sciences. In the successive
months of February, March, and
April the question was asked:
“How do literature, music, and
liturgy and art contribute to a re-
covery of meaning for modern
man?”

FACULTY HELP

Professors Bevan, Satterfield,
Gehring, Houchens, and McAfee,
together with Dr. Marshall Fisher,
Dr. E. L. Stoffel, Dr. Samuel New-
ell, and other ‘visitors, have led
the spring sessions.

GROUP CLOSES YEAR

The final meeting of the

1955-56 Student Council was

held on last Monday night. The final actions of the Council
centered around the winding up of old. business and the ap-

proval of a letter to the members of the Board of Trustees on

the enrollment. question.

Bill Bondurant gave the coun-
cil a report on recent efforts to
obtain an inter-semester break.
He said that Mr. Hengeveld. inti-
mated that the Council should re-
consider their most recent pro- |
posal which would have gained
two days. one by ~<shortening
Chrismas holidays; and the other
by .rearranging the exam sched-
ule. However, the matter will
have to wait until the May mect-
ing of the faculty.

President Perrin Anderson said
that, as he saw the problem, the
only alternative was to extend
school for an. extra. week if there
is going to be any inter-semester
hotiday. A couple of Councilmen
suggested the whole matter be
dropped.

Extension of. loeal telephone
service from Charlotte was again
discussed. Dan LaFar, next year's
Student Body President, said that
the petitions have becn presented
to the Southern Bell Telephone
Company, He noted the tremend- |
ous amount of work that Presi-
dent Anderson and Mr. Broyles,
of the Davidson Gazette, have
contributed to the project. |

A letter from Dr. Chalmers
Davidson was presented to the
Council. Dr. Davidson stated that
many books are being taken from
the library without. being checked
out. Ee’ asked the Council for
their advice in remedying this

A letter to the. Trustees of the

Council. Fhe Ietler urged the
Trustees to reconsider their re-
cent decision to increase the en-
roliment of the college. Many
facts. and figures were presented

honored guests of Davidson College filed solemnly upon the

t|stage wherein opened Davidson’s formal observance of the

hundredth anniversary year of the birth of Woodrow
Wilson.

Following the invocation led by word, rather than with profes-

sional politics. Wilson himself was
not a professional diplomat.

Perhaps Daniels presented the
essence of Wilson's philosophy by
saying, “The hopes of all men are
more important than the majesty
of any one nation.”

As a tribute to the memory of
this distinguished student of Da:
vidson College, the faculty at-
tended chapel in the long, velvet-
lined robes, adding the polishing
touch of dignity to the convoca
tion. Through the styles and
colors of the robes of the profes-
sors, as they strode to the stage,
was revealed their academic stand-
ing, fields of academic pursuit, and
past graduate alma maters.

The velvet border on the hoods
of the robes showed also through
color the field of postgraduate
study taken by the bearer. Blue:
velvet, probably the most often
seen, was worn by Doctors of
Philosophy. Scarlet velvet indi-
cated that the wearer was a Doctor

of Theology.

DANIELS’ SPEECH

Mr. Daniels observed in his
“Wilson would prefer

not that we honor his name but
that we illumine ‘his purposes—
as American as Main Street.”

a should concern herself now
