Musch, Zimmerman
Lead Cats To Victory

By Bruce Balestier

Detlef Musch continued his
fine play with 15 points and Jason
Zimmerman also scored 15 to lead
Davidson to a 62-54 victory over
Augusta Thursday night in Au-
gusta, Ga. With the win, the Wild-
cats avenged a difficult overtime
loss to the Jaguars in Davidson less
than a week earlier, and kept them-
selves in the hunt for an upper
echelon finish in the Big South
Conference. The ‘Cats now stand
at 4-6 in the conference.

Davidson suffered from aslug-
gish start, falling behind 11-2 in
the early going, and trailed 20-13
before coming to life. Nine con-
secutive points, among them two

baskets from Musch and a three-
pointer from Zimmerman, gave the
‘Cats a22-20 lead they wouldnever
relinquish. They outscored the
Jaguars 24-6 over the last 9:31 of
the first half to lead 32-24 at
halftime.

The Wildcats scored their last
field goal with 5:51 left in the
game, but proceeded to win the
game on the free throw line. For
the game, the ‘Cats hit 17-26 free
throws, the Jaguars just 3-5. Zim-
merman led the way, hitting 7-8
from the line; he is an 88% free
throw shooter on the year, tops in
the Big South. Musch continued
his hot shooting, hitting 7-11, and
also garnered 7 rebounds.

Hurricanes Beat Cats
With Rebounding

By Bruce Balestier

The stat sheet looked, on the
whole, pretty good for Davidson
after Saturday night’s game with
Miami of Florida. The “Cats out-
shot the ‘Canes 51% to 43%, made
13-14 free throws and had three
players in double figures, led by
Detlef Muschand Janko Narat with
17.

But when Davidson coach Bob
McKillop said that his club “did
not doa good job on the boards” he
meant it; the Hurricanes enjoyed a
huge 40-18 rebounding edge that
allowed them to attempt 15 more
shots than Davidson. That edge
was the critical factor in Miami’s
79-67 win.

Primarily, the Wildcats were
troubled by an injury to leading
rebounder James Marsh. Marsh,

who hurthis foot Thursday against
Augusta, could play just six min-
utes against Miami, and his pres-
enceon the glass was sorely missed.
Even so, the “Cats managed to stay
in the game, and trailed by just
seven at 52-45 with 9:23 to play.
But Miami then scored 8 unan-
swered points to assume a com-
fortable 15 point lead, . and
Davidson could never again cut
the lead under ten points.

Musch continued his accurate
shooting, hitting 7-9 from the floor
in 37 minutes of play. Jason Zim-
merman added 15 points, includ-
ing 3 three-point field goals.

The ‘Cats now stand at 6-15,
4-6 in the Big South, and meet
Winthrop, 6-13, 3-4 in the Big
South, Wednesday night at Belk
Arena.

Wrestlers Storm.
We&L Tournament

By Bruce Balestier

With the absence of senior co-
captain Joe Binns and the memory
of what coach Tom Oddo called
“dead last” finishes the previous
two years, Davidson’s return tothe
Washington and Lee Invitational
Wrestling Tournament last week-
end was anapprehensious one. For-
tunately, the much-improved Wild-
cats answered the challenge, scor-
ing 59 3/4 points to finish second
in the eight team field. Furman
captured first place with 90 points.

Said Oddo, “Going in without
Joe had me alittle nervous because
itmeant that we were taking people
in only nine of the ten weight
classes. I wasn’t sure how that

would affect us, but our guysended
up dishing outa beating. Icouldn’t
have been more pleased.

Individually, the Wildcats
recorded one 2nd place finish, four
3rds and two 4ths. Freshman Sam
Knowles took 2nd place at 150
pounds.. Freshman Robbie Fierro
(126) placed 3rd, registering the
most falls of any wrestler.in the
tournament. Junior Craig Wall; in
his first meet since being sidelined
eight weeks with back trouble, took
3rd at 177 pounds.

The ‘Cats returned to the mat
Friday and Saturday in the Mid-
South Tournament in Johnson City,
Tennessee. They meet Campbell
at Baker Sports Complex Tuesday
night at 7:00 p.m.

Eenhoorn: A Yankee
Starter By 1994?

Courtesy Sports Information

Baseball America has pro-
jected that, by the fall of 1994,
former Davidson shortstop Rob
Eenhoorn will be the starting short-

stop for the New York Yankees."

The report on Eenhoorn and the
Yankees’ other top minor league
prospects, appeared in the Febru-
ary 10-24 issue of the magazine.
Defensively, according to the
report, Eenhoorn “can play in the
big leagues rightnow.... there’s no
mistaking his natural instincts: soft

_ hands, arm strength, first-step

quickness, ability to go to his right

and make the play in the hole.”

Eenhoorn played just one sea-
son for Davidson, as a freshman in
1990, during which he led the team
in home runs (8), RBI’s (44), and
runs scored (49), while batting .363.
He was selected by the Yankees in
the second round of the draft last
June.

Hespentthe 1990 minor league
baseball season in the New York-
Penn League for the Oneonta
Yankees, where he was named to
the league’s All-Star team and
pickedas the league’smanagersas
the top major league prospect.

49'ers Take
The Hornets

Nest Trophy

By Bruce Balestier

Monday evening at Charlotte
Coliseum, Davidson outshot and
outrebounded UNCC. Unfortu-
nately, the ‘Cats also turned the
ball over 29 times and allowed the
49ers 23 more shots, and that was
the difference in UNCC’s 85-72
victory.

The first half was a nip and
tuck affair that saw UNCC hold
small leads for most of the first ten
minutes, while the mostly partisan
49er crowd waited for the knock-
out punch. They were disappointed
in that hope, however, by a
Davidson team playing patient
offense and scrappy man to man
defense.

In fact, a layup by Janko Narat
put the finishing touches on a 12-5
run that gave the ‘Cats the lead at
22-20 with 2:53 left in the half.
When Detlef Musch stole the ball
on the other end, the Wildcats
seemed poised to put themselves
in great position at the half. In-
stead, they turned the ball over 5
times in the last 2:27 of the half,
and bobbed to the surface at
halftime down 31.

Guard Bruce Elder, who trans-
ferred to Vanderbilt after a tre-
mendous freshman. season at
Davidson, scored 19 points Satur-
day night to lead the Commodores

Louisiana State. The victory gave
Vandy (13-7, 7-3) a share of first
place in the Southeastern Confer-
ence. Elder made 6-12 field goals
(1-2 three-pointers) and 6-9 free
throws.

Men's Track Bidding For Records

By Peter Hurtado

The men’strackand field team,
in action at meets at ETSU, Lyn-
chburg, and UNC this past week, is
proving to be the strongest squad
inrecent years. Highlighted by the
efforts of freshmen sprinters and
jumpers, the men are challenging
for school records in several events.

Freshman William Presson led
the way for the Wildcats, posting
the 3rd longest triple jump ever for
Davidson (40°10 1/2") at Lyn-
chburg. William’s performance in
the long jump (20' 7 1/4") makes
him Davidson’s 3rd best long

. Jumper ever.

Freshman DJ Ruggles fol-
lowed Presson with jumps of 38'
10 1/2"and 19' 11 3/4" atthe UNC
meet. DJ is also among the ten best
Davidson jumpers. ;

In the shot put, Rafael Cande-

lario and freshman Rob King be-
gan their season with solid efforts
at Lynchburg and UNC. Rob put
the shot 37' 7" at Lynchburg to
place 4th. Rafael posted an effort
of 37' 0" at UNC. These throwers
look to continue their success in
the outdoor season.

Indistance events, Captain Ted
Richardson is making a mark for
himself in Davidson Tunning his-
tory. Already this winter, Ted has
the 2nd best 5000m run, and last
week ran a sizzling 3000m run of
8:51.SatETSU, to become the 2nd
fastest runner in that event.

Ted continued his domination |

this weekend, running a quick
4:33.5 mile at UNC to place Sth.
Look for Ted to challenge several
long-standing outdoor - distance
records.

Several fine performances

were tumed in the mile. Pete Hur-
tado ran a 4:34.2 at ETSU, while
Senior John Moss posted an excel-
lent 4:46.9 at UNC. Freshman
Richard Wharton improved to
4:50.2 at UNC.

Freshman Duncan Spears,
school record holder in the 500m;
led the way inthe 400m at (54.1) at
UNC.

Duncan was followed by
Freshmen David Stewart (55.0) and
William Bobo (59.7). Ben Wiley
Tan a solid 800m of 2:07.8 for the
Wildcats.

In sprints, Freshmen Wendell
Robbins (6.73) and DJ Ruggles
(7.03) continue to improve in the
55m dash at UNC.

Coach Gary Andrew isexcited
aboutthe new additions tothe team,
and hopes to see many school rec-
Ords fall this spring.
