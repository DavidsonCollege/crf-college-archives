Eleven Colleges Represented at First
Meeting of N. C. Press Association

Next Meeting to be Held at Davidson in April—J. Eris
First President of Organization

The first meeting of the North Carolina Intercollegiate Press Associa-
tion was held in Chapel Hill on Saturday, February 5th, at the invita-
tion of the University Tar Heel. Eleven of the leading colleges in the
State were represented and the roll call showed delegates from 16 col-

lege publications.

The Davidson delegation consisted of
J. Eris Cassell, Editor-in-Chief of The
Davidsonian; Carl H. Long, Editor-in-
Chief of the 1921 Quips and Cranks; D.
L. Mahood, Exchange Editor of the
Davidson College Magazine, and John
M. Gaston, Literary Editor of The Da-
vidsonian.

Afternoon Session.

The afternoon session was held in the
Y. M. C. A. cabinet room of the Univer-
sity. Dr. Chase, President of th Univer-
sity, addressed a word of welcome to the
delegates. Dr. C. E. Graham, head of
the History Department of the Univer-
city, spoke of the possibilities of such
an association, and commended the
originators of the project for their in-
terest in starting such a movement.

The business of the meeting was de-
voted largely to discussions and the or-
ganization of the association. Daniel
L. Grant, Editor-in-Chief of the Tar
Heel, was elected temporary chairman,
and D. L. Mahood (Davidson), tempo-
rary secretary. It was decided that the
general activities of the association
should be: (1) The exchange of inter-
esting news items; (2) Contests for
magazines ; (3) Contests for newspapers ;
(4) Semi-annual conferences for the
general discussions of journalistic mat-
ters. .

Banquet.

At 8:30 o'clock the convention met
again to partake of an excellent ban-
quet given by the Tar Heel at the
“Cabin.” The table was beautifully deco-
roted and the menu was excellent. D. L.
Grant acted as toastmaster.

J. Eris Cassell (Davidson), chairman
of the Convention Committee, made a
full report and a_ constitution was
adopted. : ‘

C. H. Long (Davidson) extended an in-
vitation to the association to hold its
next meeting in Davidson. This invita-
tion was unanimously accepted. ry

The election of officers then took place
and terminated as follows: J. Eris Cas-
sel (Davidson), President; Miss Marie
Edgerton (Salem), First Vice-President;
Carroll W. Weathers (Wake Forest),
Second Vice-President; D. L. Mahood
(Davidson), Secretary; Miss Anne C.
Fulton (N. C. C W.), Treasurer.

At intervals the University quartette
gave some college songs which were
well appreciated.

Professor Hibbard, of the Journalistic
Department, gave a talk on the seven
major points of college journalism. Tyre
C. Taylor (Carolina), fresh from the
glories of the Pennsylvania debate,
spoke of the editorial problems of the
monthly magazine.

Representation.

The colleges represented were the
University, Davidson, Trinity, Wake
Forest, State College, Guilford, Elon,
North Carolina College for Women,
Queens, Meredith, and Salem. Davidson
awaits the pleasure of entertaining this

group.

Many Men Respond /
to First Call for
Track Candidates

Squad to be Built Around Nucleus of
Eight of Last Year’s Team

Already the “Knights of the Cinder
Path” have started their course of train-
ing in hopes that they may help uphold
the “Honor of old Davidson” in com-
petition with the track squads of the
other colleges this spring. When the
first call for track men was issued a
large number responded, varying in size
from the small lean dash men to the big
husky weight throwers. With such an
abundance of material Coach Grey will
be able to turn out a team which should
carry off the laurels wherever it goes.

Coach has several men who have al-
ready proven their worth when it comes
to leggin’ it around the old oval. Leon-
ard Dick, last year’s half miler, is cap-
tain and manager of the team and is in
prime condition. He will be counted on
for at least one first place in every
meet. “Bill” Worth, of mile and two
mile fame, has announced his intention
to add to the total number of points
that will be rolled up in the several
track frays that have already been ar-
ranged.

Fricker and Sprunt will also be out
trying to bring home the bacon. In the
dashes Denniston and Luke Erwin will
be fighting it out along with several
freshmen of prep-school reputation. In
the fields events McLeod and Gentry are
the only letter men back, and Coach
will have to develop several of these
mountain-like “fresh” to help them.

A meet with N. C. State has already
been arranged for April 8th, to take
place on the Hill. Meets with Wash-
ington and Lee, Clemson, and South
Carolina are pending and negotiations
with these three colleges will, in all
probability be completed within the next
few days. The State meet at Chapel
Hill will be held on May 7th, and ar-
rangements are being made for the team
to journey up and let the other schools
take the second and third places.

New Plan Adopted at
Last Sunday’s Ves-

per Service

Cassell Elected |<. dents Take Charge of Meeting—

F. V. Long and C. K. Brown
Deliver Forceful Speeches

The Y service of last Sunday evening
was one of the best of the session, and
was conducted entirely by the students.
The two addresses of the evening were
made by F. V. Long and C. K. Brown,
both members of the Senior class. A

beautiful violin solo by Buchanan added
much to the program.

Basing his remarks on II Timothy 2:3,
Flynn forcefully showed the power of
love and loyalty to Christ. During the
war France and Great Britain combined
their forces for the supreme struggle,
and many gave their lives on account of
love of country. When we entered Da-
vidson as students we made her stand-
ards our own, and we must stand up for
and live up to them.

We, however, when we accepted
Christ, became members of another
army; when we accepted Christ He ac-
cepted us, and we came under His
standard. Are we loyal? Peter and
Steven and Paul had to suffer for their
loyalty to Christ, and we may meet the
same danger, but we must prove true.
We cannot adopt the slogan, “Safety’
First,” and hold our ground. Love and
loyalty to Christ demand nothing less
than that we live for Him and_ for
others, .

' “The positive side of the true Chris-
tian life” was the thought presented
by C. K. Man in the judgment will be
held accountable, not for a few evil
deeds that he may be guilty of, but for
the multitude of right deeds that he
failed to do. Thus there are two sides
to life, the positive and the negative.
With Jesus the negative side was that
He did not engage in sinful deeds, the
positive that “He went about doing
good.”

Men might be compared to mirrors,
some being effective reflectors of the
light, some defective. Far too many are
defective, and there are two great rea-
sons offered: (1) Self-satisfaction, one
of the most powerful enemies of true
Christian living; (2) Morality without
religion. A mirror in a dark room can-
not reflect; it must be exposed to the
light. So the human being, even though
he be moral, can never be an effective
reflector unless he comes in contact with
the light and love of Jesus Christ. And
so it is our duty and our privilege to
try to develop the positive side of the
Christian life; to open our hearts and
minds and do our best, so that when
we are gone it may be said of us, “He
went about doing good.”

Team Finds Going

Hard in Three-

Day Trip Through Old Dominion

University of Virginia, Elks’ Club and Washington and Lee Too Much for
Wildcats—Roberts and J. Schenck Do Best Work for Davidson

On Wednesday the Davidsonian basketball five invaded Virginia.
determined to add several more scalps to their string, after their defeat
of N. C. State and Guilford. Bur the lads from the Old North State fell
before the onslaughts of the University of Virginia to the tune of 47 to
23. The battle at the Fayweather Gymnasium was much closer and
harder fought than fhe score would indicate, and it was not until the
last whistle that the Wildcats let the Virginians rest in peace. Not until
the Presbyterians had to play on the defensjve, because of Captain
Hatcher's wonderful shooting, did the Virginia varsity begin to forge

ahead, and roll up a large score.

SENIOR ORATORICAL

February Number of

' Magazine to Ap-
pear Soon

Short Stories to Feature Next Issue
~ ions
by Editors

The February number of the Magazine
is ready, and goes to press this week,
the management announces. This is to
be a general issue containing a number
of good short stories, as well as essays,
poems, and exchanges. Among these
will be the following: A Dog Story, by
K. G. Tucker; A Story of College Life,
by J. C. McAskill; A Business Story, by
James Bernard; the second of “Tales of
the New Order,” by Jan Alex Czuczox;
an article on North Carolina History, by
L. A. Taylor; and another on “Walter
Malone, the Southern Poet,” by Elmer
Hewitt.

A new and original negro story, by
Gospero Buckingham, begins with the
following words:

“All you niggers clear out,’ came the
shout once more. A drowsy son of
Morpheus, rolled his eys at the pro-
prietor of the restaurant and enquired
soothingly:

“Is you talkin’ to me?”

“Is I? Who you think I’se talkin’ to,
huh? Do hit looks like I's talking to dat
lamp post on de corner?”

“No, hit don’t zackly look dat way.
Wouldn’t nobody ever ’scuse as black a
thing as you is of talking to a light post.
I kinder thot you wuz talkin’ to some of
dem monkeys out to de ostrich farm, hit
‘ud be mo’ lakly.”

“Nigger, who is you——?”

But only Gospero Buckingham can
finish the fates of this contrary and
troublesome visitor. You will find it in
this month’s magazine.

a field goa] and a moment later added
another. Davidson had not found them-
selves, and Virginia was going good but
seemed to be missing a number of bas-
kets. At this stage of the game, the
Wildcats hit their stride and soon tied
the score by several long throws by
Schenck. Roberts soon put the Pres-
byterians in the lead by caging two
beautiful baskets. For the next ten
minutes scoring was about equal al-
though Virginia gradually forged closer,
until Sexton, Virginia's big center
located the basket and soon put the
University lads ahead, with some re-
markable shots. Both teams were pass-
ing wildly but Virginia seemed to be
able to locate the basket much more
frequently than the North Carolinians.
The half ended with Virginia 22, David-
son 12,

The Wildcats came back in the second
half with the good “ole” Davidson fight
and with beautiful team-work and
shooting nearly overtook the Virginian’s
lead. But Captain Hatcher soon began
caging shots from every angle, follow- ~
ed by his team-mates. The final whistle
blew with Davidson fighting hard, but
the Virginian’s were making every shot
count. Schenck and Roberts were the
chief point getters for the Wildcats,
while every man for Davidson fought
to the last. The Virginia College Topics
said, “The sportsmanship and fight of
the Davidson men is to be commended.”
