All tournament long Nike adver-
tised with a commercial featuring
Appalachian State’s football team,
NBA star Chris Paul and, ironical-
ly, the Georgetown Basketball
team. The commercial concludes
with the eerie sound of a clock
tolling midnight and the line
“There are No Cinderellas.”

The ESPN commentators will
undoubtedly talk about how
Sunday night the dazzling horse
drawn carriage carrying our ’Cats
swiftly through the national brack-
et crumbled into nothing more than
the pumpkin from which it magi-
cally sprung.

Whether or not Nike was right,
one thing is certain: Davidson is no
Cinderella.

We came back from 13 points
down twice against Gonzaga. We
overcame a 17 point second half
deficit to defeat a Georgetown
team that some analysts predicted
to win the whole thing. We made a
heavily favored Wisconsin team
look like an unworthy mid-major
with no business in the NCAA
tournament.

When I look back on this tourna-
ment, I won’t remember the seven
seconds we had to try and win
against Kansas in the Elite Eight or
how close we came to the Final
Four. I will remember all the times

Trustees fund
NCAA Detroit
trip for students

By BRIAN MorAN

Last week, as Davidson stu-
dents contemplated the ’Cats first
two NCAA tournament victories
since 1969, many returned to one
question: How will I get to
Detroit?

Enter trustees.

At 2:23 p.m. last Wednesday,
students received an e-mail from
President Ross announcing that
every student would have the
opportunity to attend the NCAA
Regional games—for free.

Given Davidson’s Sweet 16
appearance, the trustees decided
to reach into their own pockets so
that all students could witness this
historic March run. Immediately,
Davidson staff from many differ-
ent departments scrambled to
secure tickets, transportation and
lodging for over 300 students.

“The trustees’ actions say an
incredible amount about their
interest and concern for the stu-
dents,” Ross said.
