Riding high on a 7-1-1 record for September,
the Lady Wildcats soccer squad entered October
with a full head of steam. But halfway into their
toughest month of competition, it appears the
boiler may be overheating as the ‘Cats face the
toughest stretch of their schedule.

The Wildcats have been ina slump since their
Oct. 2 victory over East Tennessee State. Follow-
ing that 4-0 route of the ETSU Buccaneers on the
road, the Wildcats dropped three straight against
Clemson, Duke, and Furman, respectively. They
appeared to recover slightly this past Friday when

kick, Davidson freshman Tara Maloney closed
the gap early in the second period by launching a
shot that sailed over the head of Duke goalie Isis
Dallis and into the goal. Duke responded quickly,
however, as sophomore Sarah Pickens found the
bottom right corner of the goal and sealed Duke's
2-1 victory.

Once again, the Cats were out-shot, getting
off only four shots compared to Duke’s 20, and
Davidson notched only three corner kicks, seven
less than their opponent.

The ’Cats looked to get back on track when
they traveled to upstate South Carolina Oct. 12 to
take on Southern Conference foe Furman, the only
team besides Davidson that remained undefeated

they played in Southern
Brown to a 1-1 . . Conference ac-
tie. “Davidson is ‘a very good team. They tion.

squeaked past Corrigan in the second half was all
the Tigers needed to snap the Wildcats’ unde-

Maloney were the only Cats who managed to get
off shots in the 1-0 loss to the Tigers, who entered
the game No. 10 in the National Soccer Coaches
Association of America (NSCAA) rankings.

“While we’re never satisfied with losing a
game, Clemson is the strongest team we’ ve played

‘ upto this point, and we proved to ourselves that we

can keep games close with teams _at this level,”
commented Head Coach Kevin Hundley follow-
ing the Clemson game.

The ’Cats traveled to Durham next for an Oct.
8 non-conference match against Duke, another
team ranked at kickoff in the NSCAA’s Top 25.
Duke struck first midway through the first half
with a shot setup by a deflection from a corner

Maloney, net-
ted the Wildcats’ first goal of the evening at the
26:37 mark. Johnston’s goal was one of only two
Davidson shots in the first half, but it sent the ‘Cats
into the last 45 minutes of play with a 1-0 lead.
Furman did not lie down, however, as the Lady
Paladins fought back in the early moments of the
second half, finally evening the score with a shot
by Nicole Malseed who tapped in a corner kick at
the 71:52 mark.

After 90 minutes of play, the 1-1 tie forced
the game into overtime, but Furman’s Melissa
Turner, who had left the game earlier with an
apparent leg injury, returned to drill the game-
winner past Corrigan. With the 2-1 victory, Furman
took exclusive control of the Southern Confer-
ence, and Davidson dropped to 5-1 in conference
play.

score a great goal like that in
overtime is incredible,” said
Furman Head Coach Brian Lee.
“Davidson is a very good team.
They really made us earn a hard-
fought win.”

Reeling from the recent 3-
game skid, the ‘Cats hosted
Brown University Oct. 15 and
looked as if they were returning
to form, even though they had to
settle for a 1-1 tie. Sophomore
Carolyn Stumpf scored the ’Cats’
lone goal of the evening, pound-
ing a shot past Brown keeper
Elise Roy from 20 yards out.
Brown answered late in the game
as Kristin Nabb relayed a corner
kick into the goal. The fruitless
overtime period that followed left
Davidson with their second tie of
the season.

“Our conference games are
the main concentration right now,
and are must-wins for us,” said
Hundley at the first of October,
“but we feel as.though we are
playing well and that’s what you
strive for at this point of the sea-
son.”

Since that comment the
*Cats have gone 1-1 in confer-
ence play, including their 4-0
ETSU win, so it is expected the
season that got off to the best start
in school history will soon recover from the recent
slump. Three losses and a tie in four games that
came over an 11-day period may not be a stellar
record, but don’t forget the big picture — eight
wins in the first 11 games, a school record eight
shutouts this season, and the second best record in
the Southern Conference.

While victories would have been nice, the
losses over the last two weeks by no means signal

the demise of the ’Cats’ recording-making season.
The ’Cats (8-5-2, 5-1) face three more SoCon
opponents before the end of October, including
defending Southern Conference champs UNC-
Greensboro. They will host the UNCG Spartans
Oct. 21, and kickoff is scheduled for 7 p.m.
