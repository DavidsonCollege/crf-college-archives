THE DAVIDSONIAN, MAY 10, 1928

Tedoir-Rhyne Wins

_From Davidson Nine

Last Wednesday proved an unluck day for
Wildcat diamond hopes, when the locals ‘suf-
fered an unexpected setback at the hands of
Dick Gurley and his Lenoir-Rhyne Moun-
tain Bears. 9 to 7 was the margin by which
the Hickory lads downed Davidson's ball
handlers.

After being presented with a six-run lead
in the second frame, “Doc” Kugler was
driven from the box by a rejuvenated Lenoir
team, and John McInnis came to the rescue
too late fo snatch the game from the fire.
Meanwhile, Rumple, Gurley’s star southpaw,
proceeded to set the Wildcats down in very
decisive fashion, and they could do little or
nothing with his offerings.

The game gav evidence of quite a let-down
on the part of the Jungaleers, since they had
been picked as easy winners. Erratic field-
ing and the old, old failure to hit in the
pinches ‘spelled defeat for Younger’s men.
Last spring the Bears lost to Davidson by a
11-3 count.

everyone for the response made to. the rule
abolishing the semi-annual “‘D’ Club round,”
the response having been shown by not
breaking in on initiations and meetings. He
furthermore has said that this new ruling

done this year, in that it has benefited both

A Mother on Mother’s Day, Sunday
at “Y” Vespers

Friendship was discussed at vespers last
Sunday evening. On next Sunday an
emotion greater than friendship will come
to the minds of all students. A special
Mother’s Day program has been arranged,
with special music and decorations for
the occasion.. The talk of the evening will
be delivered by Mrs.
North Wilkesboro, who is the mother of
some former Davidson men. Mrs. Finley
is.a woman of some note in the state, and
the “Y” promises a splendid message.
Also, there will be something in the nature
of a surprise for each student attending.
The character of this cannot be released,
but the “Y” urges everyone to attend ves-
pers and find out for themselves. The
services will be held in Shearer, instead
of on the lawn, as usual.
=
Rev. H. W. DuBose, D.D., pastor of the
First Presbyterian Church of Spartan-
burg, will conduct the last vesper services
of the year. Dr. DuBose is well known as
a speaker of ability and one of the. ablest
men in the Southern Presbyterian Church.

Election of officers on the new “Y”
Board of Control have been completed by
the date of publication. Dr. H. B. Ar-
Buckle, head of the chemistry department,
is chairman of the new board.

There are still a few copies of the “Tes-
tament for Fishers of Men” at the “Y”
office. Anyone who desires to purchase
a copy of this helpful edition of the New
Testament can do so. Also, although prac-
tically five hundred copies of the booklet,
‘Why. the “Y”, have been mailed out, stu-
dents may still obtain copies of it at the
“Y” room. f

Fresh ‘Pinte Th eam
Near End of Season

After a fairly successful season the Fresh-
man tennis team wil! probably play their last
maich this week. According to W. L. Poe,
manager of the team, plans are under way
with Charlotte High for a match here some
time within the next few days. If played,
this will be the concluding match of the year
for the Freshmen.

Up to date the Freshmen have playde four
matches, two with Winston-Salem and two
with the Carolina Fresh team. They easily
won the matches over Winston-Salem with
a score of 5-1 each time. They lost to Caro-
lina, however, 5-1 and 4-2,

The second match with the Carolina net-
men was held last Saturday at Davidson.
Though the Kittens suffered defeat from the
Tar Babies, nevertheless the whole team
played fine tennis but were unable to with-
stand the fast serves and hard lofts that their
opponents used. Poe, the Freshman ace,

Fresh Oratoriéals

to be Held Friday

Tomorrow night at 8 o’clock the most
eloquent member of the freshman class...
will be chosen when the finals of ‘the
fresh oratoricals are hold in Shearer hall.
Four men will compete in this contest.
They.are J. C. Matthews, P. W. Glidewell,
R. Overman, and Wm. Rembert. These

|men were selected in a preliminary con-

test held about two months ago in which
eight men contested.

The judges.for the contest Friday night
are Prof. Currie and Doctors C. K. Brown
and T. W. Lingle. The winner of this
contest will be presented with a gold med-
al during the commencement: exercises.
This contest has been sponsored by the
two literary societies who have provided
the medal.

This is the first year that a freshman
oratorical contest has been held. In for-
mer years each literary society chose its
best declaimer and these then contested
inthe final meet. The Forensic Council,
however, decided: that this innovation
would prove more interesting and bene-
ficial to the freshmen.
