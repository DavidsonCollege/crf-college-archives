ROTC Awards Scholarships

By Tom Price

A record sixteen Davidson stu-
dents have received merit scholar-
ships from the United States Army.
The scholarship will provide
$12,000 per year to be used for
tuition, books, andotherfees. Each
recipient will also receive a per-
sonal expense stipend of $100 per
month.

Major Mike Hawkins noted,
“Davidson students normally do
quite well in the national competi-
tion for Army scholarships.” This
year students were particularly
successful and Hawkins added,
“There are more Army scholarship
winners on campus this year than

any year since 1919 when ROTC
was established at Davidson Col-
lege.”
». The Scholarships are awarded
to outstanding students and are
based solely on merit, without
regard to financial need. The na-
tional competition is open annu-
ally to high school seniors and
college freshman.

The nine freshman recipients

of four year scholarships were

Benjamin Balsley, Joseph Beach,
George Hiatt, nnis Malcor,
Jonathan Peters, Eric Rosenbach,
Telisha Ruddick, Thomas
Shelburne, and Patrick White.

In addition, freshmen Eric Hall,

Glen McClung, and Brian McGin-
nis received three-year advanced
designee scholarships which will
begin their sophomore years.

Four Sophomores also won
scholarships. They are Jeffrey
Crain, Jason Morris, William
Pomeroy, and Richard Rivera.

Davidson students interested
in applying for these Army merit
scholarships can contact Major
Mike Hawkins in the Department
