Fails at Appointment

After failing to win a coveted
appointment to West Point, Col.
Armstrong enlisted at the Statue
of Liberty in New York harbor in
1905 for service in the Signal Corps
of tne Army. Two years later he
was in Cuba, helping suppress an
armed revolt.

Upon his return from Cuba
1908, Col. Armstrong won a com-
petitive examination for a commis-
sioned appointment in the Philip-
pine Scouts. At the age of 24 hé
lieu-

in

was commissioned a second
tenant, and since that time he has
passed rapidly through the various
grades subordinate to the rank of
colonel. Returning from the war in
1920 as a major, he was the com-
manding officer of the troops on

the U. S. A. T. Thomas.

Sees Many Lands

Colonel Armstrong has seen a
variety of lands during his army
career. Besides serving in Cuba
and the Philippines, he has fought
against hostile Moro tribes in the
South Seas. Since returning from
the war, he has served in Okla-
homa, Kansas, New York, and Ari-
zona. From the last named place,
where he remained for ten years,
he was transferred to Davidson to
take up his new duties here.
