Senator Ervin Visits;
Talks Labor, Rights, K

By R. G. DAVIDSON

U.S. Senator Sam J. Ervin, Jr., from North Carolina, former trustee of Da-

vidson College, and member of the McClellan

Committee,

informally discussed

political questions at the Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fraternity house Wednesday night.

The event, sponsored by the
fraternity, was planned with
the idea that “a fraternity
house is a good sounding board
for informal discussions.”

Upon arriving at Davidson
the Senator and Mrs. Don Cof-
fey, President of the Minerva
Club, were honored at a_ban-
quet.

To get the group in the pro-
per mood the Senator began
“I know there is not a school
in the country that gives a
better education than David-
son College. The faculty is re-
sponsible for this; you are very
lucky.”

Some of the subjects discus-
sed and Senator Ervin’s com-
ments follow:

The President's veto—was it
used too much during the 86th?
“His veto only deterred a small
housing plan. All major bills
were passed.”

HOFFA

Mr. Hoffa—how does he
stand? “I could talk about him
‘a long, long time. He is only
looking out for himself and his
friends; the Teamster’s Union
has to suffer as a’ result.”

Dave Beck—What did he re-
veal? “Dave Beck gave his

name, where he was from, and
150 Fifth Amendments!”

KHRUSHCHEV
Khrushchev’s visit what
should our response be, what
should he see, and what will
its effect be? “The President

invited him, so I think all
Americans should treat him
with utmost courtesy. He

should be shown some of the
industrial might of the U. S.
This might deter a Third World
War.” About the visit’s effect
on the world Senator Ervin
stated, “I’m like the jury who
saw the split 6 and 6 and can-
not give a verdict.”
STATES’ RIGHTS

Centralization of .' Federal
power—is it a threat to state
sovereignty? “The closer home
your government is, the better
you are; you can control your
home governments. With cen-
tralization of power the gov-
ernment can almost get out of
control. It is one of the ser-
ious problems we have. We
can’t curb centralization unless
people want to curb it.”

Appropriations—was Congress
too extravagant? “The 86th
Congress is supposed to be very
extravagant yet the Budget

Bureau requested we spend
many more dollars than were
actually passed.”

Civil Rights legislation —
what will the Northerners pass
in the next Congress? “The
worst bill is the Douglas Bill.
If it is passed the Department,
of Health, Education, and Wel-
fare will have the right to
force integration in all South-
ern schools. The Department
would possess more power than
the state governments, and the
Attorney General could back
up the Department's rulings.”

YMCA Launches
Membership Drive

Monday saw the David-
son YMCA launch its year-
ly membership drive dif-
ferently than in previous
years, with the financial
drive being a totally sepa-
rate arm of the. overall
campaign.
