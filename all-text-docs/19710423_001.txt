FEC To Contemplate Open Faculty Meetings

By RICH WILSON
Managing Editor

The Faculty Executive
Committee (FEC) will con-
‘sider Tuesday three propos-
als drafted by a subcommit-
tee of students and profes-
sors which would allow stu-
dent participation in faculty
meetings.

The FEC will presumably
act on these proposals Tues-
day and send recommenda:
tions to the faculty for con-
sideration at their meeting
May 4.

“The purpose in drafting
three separate proposals is
to allow the faculty to pick
and choose what they like
and do not like about the dif-
ferent suggestions,’’ said Stu
dent Body President Danny
Clodfelter.

“The subcommittee recog
nizes the problems involved
in opening these meetings:
however, we feel there are
ways to, solve these difficul
ties,’’ he said.

The first proposal. recom-
mends that the faculty desig-
nate a certain number of
seats, not fewer than 15, that
would be open to any mem-
-ber of the student body.

Students desiring to attend
faculty meetings would sign
up ins the Academic Vice
President's office in advance

of the meeting. The first
names on the list would be
permitted to attend.

These students would be
given certain floor privileges
but no vote. Faculty meet-

‘ings could be closed only by

a three-fourths vote of those
present,

“Under such a vote,’ said
the proposal, ‘visitors shall
leave the meeting, but shall
be permitted to return when
the matter which led to the
desire for closing the meet-
ings has been disposed of.
When . appropriate, visitors
shall be informed of any of-
ficial action taken by the

faculty in closed session.”

The second proposal allows
for attendance of the Stu-
dent Body President and
Vice President as well as all
students on faculty commit-
tees;

Under. this proposal the
faculty would allow these
students certain floor privi-
leges but no vote. And as
stated in the first proposal,
the meetings could be closed
by a three-fourths vote of
those present.

The third proposal allows
for attendance and _ voting
privileges of the President
and Vice President

Lose Social Funds

By ALEC HOON
News Editor

A resolution to cut off so-
cial funds to the fraternities
excluding freshmen
ees from. participation in
their social life overwhelm-
ingly passed the student sen-
ate Monday night.

The SGA version of the
proposal was then sent to
the Student Life Committee
(SLC), where on Tuesday
afternoon. it was approved
with one minor addition.

The final SLC version
reads: “Any freshman with
a complaint about exclusion
from participation in the
activities of a house to
which he is assigned should
notify the Dean of Students
or may register a complaint
with the SLC.

“If fifty percent of the
freshmen assigned to a given
house sign a statement that
they are being exciuded
from the social life of the
house, all college-provided
social fees to the house shall
be suspended immediately,
pending final action from the
SLC:”

The Dean of Students was
requested to notify fraterni
ty presidents of the senate’s
resolution and the SLC ac-
tion.

When asked about the im-
mediate repercussions of the
action, Dean of Students
Will H. Terry stated, “We
will pay the board bills to
all «fraternities participat-
ing in self-selection as soon
as possible. However, the
‘social fees will be withheld

assign-

one week.”

If no complaints are re-
gistered, the normal fee of
ten dollars per student’ per
month will be sent to the
houses involved in the new
social system.

In other senate action, 20-
dollars was appropriated to
arm student volunteers with
flashlights and whistles to
prevent any further theft: of
auto parts from college park-
ing Ipts.

Reporting to ‘the SGA,
senior Frank Rader stated
that approximately
gas caps and miscellaneous
motorcycle parts have al-
ready been stolen this year.

Rader stated that present-

ly ‘“‘there is only one man
on security duty at night.
It is physically impossible

for him to provide adequate
security for all parked cars
in addition to his other re-
sponsibilities.”’ ;

Rising sophomore Woody
Connette, reporting for the
Union Food Committee, .out-
lined a budget request for
106 dollars ta investigate the
food catering services at
seven other schools. The
senate unanimously approv-
ed the request.

Rising Senior Senator Ce-
cil Burney introduced a mo-
tion in the senate for the
college to rehire Dr. Mere-
dith Hall as the clinical psy-
chologist next~year.

Burney urged an immed-
iate change in the budget
priorities to allow Dr. Hall
to return.

The motion passed by a
unanimous: vote.

faculty on May 4 for. a final
vote.

Some required P. E. would
continue under the new plan,
but Vice President for Aca-
demic Affairs John M, Be-
van estimated that about half
the new students would be
exempt from requirements.

Under the new program,
the student would have to
show proficiency in four in-
dividual sports and one team
sport.

Ae

The student would be re-
quired to take P.° E. to
achieve proficiency in up to
four of the individual areas
and one team area. The full
length of the entire course
would be six quarters.

Bevan, who was confident
that the faculty would agree
to the new prograni, said in
an interview Wednesday that
the emphasis in the P. E.
program was being shifted
from simple attendance to
proficiency.

This, he said, expresses
the college policy that phy-
sical activities are an. im-
portant part of normal life
and therefore of educatjon.
He further said that the ol
lege could now deal with the
P. E. students as individuals,
treating each according to
his needs.

“The success or failure of
the program,” Bevan said,
‘will depend on the enthusi-
asm of the staff, and the en-
thusiasm they are able to
generate in the students.”

He said there were no
plans to add additional staff
to the P. E. department, and
that ‘the new program was
formulated so that the exist-
ing staff could handle it.

The student will plan his
own courses, with voluntary
attendance. He will receive
one grade, ‘‘S,”” upon satis-
factory demonstration of pro-
ficiency in that area. There
will be regular classes and
tutorials. Service classes in

be available.

Those who have partially
completed the present P. EK,
requirements will probably
have their requirements ad
justed on oan _ individual
basis, Bevan said. Participa-
tion in intercollegiate ath-
letics will count as one ac-
tivity toward fulfilling the
requirement.

Professor of . Psychology
John ‘D. Kelton, who was a
faculty member on the sub-
cominittee, said he is ‘“‘hesi-
tant and apprehensive”’ about
the issue of open faculty
meetings.

“On the one hand there
ought to be an avenue Yor-
student input; however, the
quality of relationship and
mutual understanding within
faculty meetings might be
lost if nonfaculty were pres-
ent,”’ Kelton said.

Optimistic

Despite Slow Deposits

Despite a slow start in tui
tion deposit returns, Direc
tor Of Admissions iH. Ed
munds White remains confi
dent. that next fall’s fresh
man class ‘will be within
five of what we expected.”

After yesterday's, morning
mail the college had received
the hundred dollar deposit
from only 95 applicants with
the May 1 deadline drawing
near”

White indicated that while
this is somewhat lower than
previous years, there are
circumstances which may
have contributed to the low
initial response.

“The number we receive
has risen steadily over the
past several days,’ White
said. ‘‘Thursday we received
15, Wednesday nine and
Tuesday just four. We fre-
quently get a large number
of deposits at the deadline
date.”

Another problem which has
hampered the early returns
has been a mailing mixup.

According to White the ac-
ceptance letter which was
mailed urged all applicants
to wait until they received a
copy of the Code of Respon-
sibility before they made
their final decision. A mix-
up in the mailing room re-
sulted in the later mailing
of the code by third class
mail. Many applicants re-

“letter to

ceived their copies in the
last several days.

“TL am concerned, worried
is too strong a word, about
the size of next year's class,
but in both directions,’’ said
White.

“Any time you overaccept
as we do, you run the risk of
a class’ too small or too big.
But the experience of the
last 10 years tells us that
with the waiting list we will
come within five of our
goal,"’

White said that the admis-
sions office is planning on a
freshman enrollment of about
310 in the fall, one of the
largest classes in the history
of the college.

The housing office has al
ready reserved all of Watts,
Cannon and East dormitories
for the freshman class.

In an attempt to influence
applicants the admissions of
fice is furnishing postpaid
postcards for present stu
dents.to write to those ac-
cepted. Faculty members
are also «being asked to
write to those who have been
accepted.

President Samuel R. Spen
cer Jr. and Vice President
for Academic Affairs John
M. Bevan have sent a joint
those accepted,
terming Davidson a ‘“‘great
institution.”
