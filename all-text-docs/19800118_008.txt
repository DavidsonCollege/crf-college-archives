Womack tops 1,000 career points

‘as team aims for winning season

By BILL WILSON
_ Staff Writer
Sarah Womack, Davidson's
outstanding woman basketball
player; has been practicing her
outside shot since she was an
eighth-grader in Stone Mount-
ain, Ga. Friday night against
N.C. Wesleyan one of. her
characteristic soft, arching

jumpers in the first half put her

name in Davidson’s. record
books as the first female to
score 1,000 career points. Al-
though ‘the Lady Wildcats lost
61-56, Womack led all scorers in
the game with 19 points, upping
her career total to 1,011.
Reaching the 1,000 point
plateau ‘‘really is a big honor”

she acknowledges,.although -

she insists that ‘the whole team
was responsible for it.””.We-
mack’s 6wn talent and persever-
ance are most liable for her
uccess; however. 7)

Womiack’s exposure to ath-
letics began as a youngster in
Georgia. ‘I’ve always loved
sports;-and my family has
always played sports. I played
basketball with my brother and
dad from the ees she
says.

Womack played forward for
Clarkson High School in Stone
Mountain, and her penchant for
scoring brought visits from
several college coaches during
her senior yea’. She says she
chose Davidson for reasons
other than athletics, however.

‘Tl didn’t come to college
solely to play basketball,’’ she
says. “If I’d gone to Mercer {a
college in Georgia which recruit-
ed her; it boasts a strong
women’s basketball program),

I'd have concentrated on bas-
ketball.”’

Womack arrived at Davidson
the same year Susan Roberts
took over as head basketball
coach and has started for Rob-

erts ever since. The Lady -

Wildcat’s 9-10 record her fresh-
man year has been their best
ever, and Womack has yet to
play on a winning team. She has
played consistently well
throughout her career, however,
and often has provided much-

‘needed scoring punch.

This year Womack, a for-
ward, is averaging just over 21
points per game and is headed
toward her best season ever.

The young team she leads |

might be, too. For once Wo-
mack is not Davidson’s tallest

‘ player on the floor—freshman

center Mike Frankhouser and
Sarah’s sister Jean, also a

- freshman, “add needed height to

the lineup. Mitzi Short, another
freshman, also starts at guard
along with experienced junior
Kirby Owen. Carol Hepner, a
usual starter, is out with a knee
injury.

“We've got some good talent
on the team this year,’ Wo-
mack says. “It takes a while to
get used to each other. I feel
there’s been a definite improve-
ment form the beginning of the
year.”’

The Lady Wildcats have been
edged out in close games this
season by conference leaders
Bennett and N.C. Wesleyan.
They play Wesleyan later this
month, and ‘‘we can beat

_ them,’’ Womack says. With her

shooting they just might.

By KIRBY OWEN :
Staff Writer
During’ the past week, the
Lady Wildcats had 3 close
games and they finally came out
with a victory at Warren Wilson
by a margin of’2 points, 55-53.
The other: 2 games were dis-
appoieing $5 to Bennett,

3-3 on th msi ay
conference: y, with 11 games

After coming back early from
Christmas break and having
three days of hard practice, the
Cattes were confident that they
could defeat the Belles of Ben-
nett, the top team in the confer-
ence. With ‘the game five min-
utes old and Davidson holding
Bennett scoreless with a tena-
cious man-to-man defense, it
appeared as if the Cattes were
on their way to victory. How-
ever, by halftime, Bennett had
made some adjustments and
had gone ahead by five, 28-23.

Davidson dutscored Bennett

by four in the second half even
though they shot 31% from the
field and 50%: from the line as
compared to 40% from the field

Davidson had the better shoot-
ing percentage from the field in
the second half but were beaten
at the line.

In the Wesleyan game, Sarah
Womack had 19 points which
pushed her career total at
Davidson past 1000 points.
Mike Frankhouser had 15
points and Mitzi Short added
sl

Davidson’s third game in
seven days resulted in a victory
for the Cattes as they held on
against the Owls of. Warren
Wilson. Davidson had a 12
point lead at halftime which
swelled to as much as 24 during
the second half but due to
circumstances. beyond their
control, they. had to fight hard
to preserve the victory. Sarah
Womack had 18 points which
gives her 1029 for her career and
Mike Frankhouser crashed the
boards and grabbed 22 re-
bounds.

_ Davidson's next home game
is Thurday, January 23 at 7:30
p.m. against St. Andrews, a
very strong team in the confer-
ence so the Cattes need your

support. *

by two

and 66.7% from the line for the
Belles. With 13 seconds left and
the score 48-47, Davidson had
one last chance as they had
possession of the ball but they
weren’t able to convert.

Sarah Womack led the team
with 15 points and 8 rebounds,
while Kirby Owen and Jeanne
Womack added 12 and 10
points, Sespectively. Next

cial conference game.

The second game of the week
was against North Carolina
Wesleyan, the team that won
the Division III state title last
year but was 1-6 on the season
when they came to Davidson on
Friday night.

At halftime, the Bishops were
up by 10 on the strength of 55%
shooting from the field as com-
pared to 26% for the Wild-
cattes. At the beginning of the
second half, N.C. Wesleyan
increased their lead to as- ‘much
as 13 points but the Cattes
battled back arid the margin
seesawed between three and five
points in favor of the Bishops.
