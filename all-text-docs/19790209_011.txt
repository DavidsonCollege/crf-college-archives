seemed to believe.Furthermore,
students contended that the
scheduling of exams would not
reduce the incidence of cheat-
ing. In sum, student opinion
was almost unanimously opposed
to any move to increase the
possibility of scheduled exams.

The petition arose Friday in
response to the release of the

the 1978-1979 freshman class
show that while 70 percent of
the men applicants in the top
tenth of their high school class
were admitted, only 58 percent
of the top decile of women
applicants were admitted.”

The proposal further points
out that since a trend is
‘developing toward more women
applicants, yet while Davidson
continues to maintain a fixed
quota, an greater
number of female appllicants
will be refused simply because
they are women.

Already since 1976 the pro-
portion of female to male ap-
plicants to Davidson has risen
10 percent.

The recommendation also
states that with an admissions
policy more favorable to wo-
men, the number of female
applicants will increase because
they will foresee greater chances
for acceptance. This could help
assuage the crunch in the
declining number of college
students that has already begun
to hit many small private liberal
arts colleges.

“I think it is a very sound
proposal that reflects good re-
search,” said Dean of Admis-
sions Edmunds White, who also
sérves on the Advisory Com-
mittee reviewing the proposal. ,

Of those signing the petition
some, like Shi, stated as an
important reason for their action
their deep concern about -the
pressure placed on the honor
code by self-scheduled exams.

he said, “sometimes the last

this evaluation. Davies stated
that he “objects strenuously to

to self-scheduling was. the fact
that during the exam period no
professor is present to clarify
obscure questions or to correct
errors on the exam. French
points out that “unless a facul-

during all exams there will be no
means of clarification.” .
Professors also pointed out
that the current restriction on

asked NOW to submit more of
the research they have done on
equal access admissions, such
as faculty opinion and the
effects the policy has had on

Lisa Shingler, Chairperson of

tee, said ‘‘We’re guardedly op-
timistic, encouraged by the fact
that they're (the Advisory

Last September senior Martha
Sanford submitted a proposal to
end sexual quotas in admissions
policy at Davidson.,She ap-
proached the Constitutional Re-
view Committee on September
28 with a petition bearing 340

student signatures in support of —

her proposal.

The CRC, however, did not
act on Sanford’s proposal be-
cause it was not perceived as a
Constitutional matter. But San-
ford said, ‘I believe we were
successful in that we made
students think about the is-

pressed the hope that the

says Political Science Professor
Louis Ortmayer. ‘‘I have some
gripes in practice, but those are
purely administrative.’’ Ort-
mayer mentioned the short .
amount of time allotted to grade
exams as a problem.

Chemistry professor Horace
Bryan, who chaired the EPC
subcommittee to study self-

scheduling, feels that some

administrative problems would
arise from adoption of a dual
system of examinations.

He felt that problems would
be caused by the necessity of
making up two different exams
for two different sections of a
course, and. the possible neces-
sity of extending the exam
period so that students would
not have 3 scheduled exams too
close together. Bryan also bets
that problems could arise in a
system where some students
were taking exams they could
discuss and others were not.

Almost all of the professors
interviewed said they see very
little evidence of cheating in
their own classes, and add
they still have confidence in
students’ integrity. All stress
that students would be wrong
to assume there has been a lack
of faith in the honor system on
the part of the faculty.

Academic Vice-President
Price Zimmermann stressed the
role of students in preserving
the self-scheduled exam sys-
tem. He feels that if the system
is to be preserved students
must work at it. Zimmermann
looks for ‘‘some official declara-
tion by students of their deter-
mination to insure that the
honor system works well enough
to cover self-scheduled exams.
The faculty might be impres-
sed,” he says, “‘by-an action of
