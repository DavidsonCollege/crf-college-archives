Ambassadors reach out to 50 states for prospectives

By TOM KOONCE

In an effort to bring all aspects of
studentinvolvement together in the ad-
missions process, a group entitled the
Davidson Ambassadors has been
formed. The new effort, supervised by
the admissions office, will combine
campus tours, letter writing, high
school visits, hosting prospective stu-
dents and planning SGA weekend into
a comprehensive and more organized
program. .

The ambassadors are student vol-
unteers selected from an initial pool of

approximately 100 students. Junior
Kristi Kessler was selected president of
the group. She emerged as the most
qualified choice because of her past
work with the admissions office, the
Student Senate and SGA Weekend.
SGA President Tripp Helms said of
Kessler, “There’s no doubt in anyone’s
mind that she'll do a good job.”
Specifically, the ambassadors will
be headed by four area coordinators
whooversee activities in particular geo-
graphical regions and a senator who
oversees SGA Weckend. Volunteers

can participate in as many areas as they
wish. Kessler hopes that the Davidson
ambassadors will be able to find other
ways to use student volunteers in the
admissions process.

Helms believes that the SGA’s in-
volvement in this new program is only
appropriate. He says it is the most ap-
propriate student organization to rep-
resent Davidson outside of campus,
since the SGA is represented by all fac-
ets of Davidson campus life. It is impor-
tant that the SGA and Davidson Am-
bassadors have the same goals, stated

Helms. Both groups are particularly
interested in recruiting prospective stu-
dents.

According to Kessler, the ambassa-
dors program is vital to the admissions
process because it is the students that
make a college what it is. Helms also
conveyed this feeling, saying that stu-
dent involvement in admissions,
“sends a very positive message to pro-
spective students that representatives
of the student body care enough about
Davidson to take part in the recruiting

Gorbachev shakes up Politburo

By CAROL GATEWOOD

UNITED NATIONS: In his
first presidential speech to the
United Nations, President
Bush introduced a proposal to
decrease the number of U.S.
chemical weapons. Bush sug-
gested that the U.S. eliminate
80 percent of its chemical
weapons upon the Soviet Un-
ion’sagreement tocutits stock-
pile to the “American level.”
Bush also promised to “elimi-
nate all American. chemical
arms within a decade if a treaty
banning such weapons all over
the world was signed.” The
New York Times reported that
Bush’s advisers hoped that this
speech would, outdo Mikhail
Gorbachev's appearance at the
United Nations last year,
where the leader of the Soviet

Union announced unilateral
cuts in conventional forces.
Secretary of State James Baker
later commented thatif the two
superpowers agree to cut
chemical weapons it will set an
example to Third World na-
tions thatare producing, and in
some cases, using chemical
weapons.

HO CHI MINH CITY: On
Tuesday Vietnam officially
ended its 11-year occupation of
Cambodia. Despite Vietnam-
ese efforts to establish a “client
regime,” the Khmer Rouge (in
Cambodia) still threaten the
legitimate Cambodian Gov-
ernment that was installed in
December 1978. Victnam sol-
diers returning home do not
seem to be celebrated. Rather
the country seems to be preoc-

cupied by a range of prob-
lems—from overpopulation
and unemployment to political
corruption and hunger.

MOSCOW: President Mikhail
Gorbachev announced some
changes in the Communist
Party’s Politburo and Secretar-
iat. This move ca in re-
sponse to a loss of pafty, power
amidst ethnic unrest. It is the
largest purge to occur in Gor-
bachev’s four and a half years
of power, and it involved the
dismissal of hard-liners in the
party leadership. Gorbachev
said in a speech following the

changes that the Communist

Party must “resolutely move
forward without giving in to
those who would like to keep

process,”
_

usin thé pastand on the road of

retreat.”
