Leaving tomorrow for Charleston and its famed Azalea fes-
tival will be a bus load of Davidson's trackmen set for their sec-
ond win of the season and an even break for the season. As
somewhat of a sidelight for the cindermen is the meet Saturday
afternoon which they should win.

On last Saturday the boys lost a close one 66-60 to N.C. State
in an engagement which was slated as a toss up. The States
cinched the afternoon in the final javelin toss after sweeping
the discus with tosses shorter than those of Davidson's Ter-
fell, and VanI.andingham in the qualifying rounds which they
were unable to repeat.

Laurels again to Arch Taylor for his 15.4 seconds on the 120
high hurdles which cut 1 1-10 seconds off the stadium record.
Payton Halloman, sophomore Wolf shows promise in turning
in a 50.3 quarter to shatter another record field. Gene Shannon
cleared 12’ 6” on the pole vault, topping his previous best by
half a foot, but took only a second.

SETTLED DISPUTE-

Word comes from Blacksburg in a letter ‘from Monk Yon-
ger, once a Davidson coach himself, that the discus which the
Gobblers threw in their meet with Davidson, while not exactly
regulation size, was too little under standard to call for a for-
feit in that event. The Techmen's disc weighed six-ounces-un-
der the regulation 4 pounds, and, on investigation, it was found
that the Davidson platter was a little over the specified pound-
age, making it unofficial also. So, the score is settled, standing

as it did before the controversy arose—75 2-3 to 50 1-3 against
