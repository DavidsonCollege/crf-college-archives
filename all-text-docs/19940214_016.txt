16 THE DAVIDSONIAN B ACK PAGE INTERVIEW. MONDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1994

he Samples call Boulder,

Colorado, home but have

spent most of the past year on the road.

Their stay in Davidson lasted fewer than
24 hours, but in between sound-check and dinner,
Sean Kelly (lead, guitar, vocals, slide guitar and 12-
string) and Andy Sheldon (bass, harmony and lead

vocals) granted us a few moments out of their hectic schedule.

February 11, 1994

Josh: Will you talk a little bit
about the name of your band?
Andy: Well, pink is our favorite
color and Floyd is from Floyd
Sweeney—so we just said
Pink Floyd. Then we figured that it
was already a pretty popular name.
Sean: And then. . . guess this one
..+ Wwe came up with the flavor of
vanilla.

Andy: Our favorite ice cream.
Sean: And so we said Milli
Vanilla...But that didn’t work be-
cause of vanilla ice

cream.

Andy: And Manila envelopes.
Sean: And then we bought this
book of band names that had never
been used and there was only one
name and we had to use it. It was
"The Samples."

Josh: How about your influences?
Given the sound of your band it
sounds like you have a wide range
of musical tastes.

Andy: Between all four of us I
think that you could pretty much
cover the whole musical spectrum.
If you look at the CDs on our bus
you’ll find anything from jazz, rap,
Neil Young, classical. We pretty
much like everything. Even disco.
Sean: And old time Band. Big
Band. I like that type of music.
Josh: OK, fill in the blank here:
“If I could tour with my favorite
’70s band, it would be...”
Andy: The Village People.

Sean: Zeppelin.

Josh: I understand you guys have
a pretty rigorous touring. sched-
ule. Does that at all wear you
down?

Andy: Yeah, but we’re pumped up
with so many pills that we get by.
We also take steroids to get us

going.

Amy: Can you talk a little bit
about your progression as a
band? How your sound has
changed? “The Last Drag”
sounds more mellow to me than
your earlier work.

Sean: None of our CDs hit any
peak like top 40 or anything. They
don’t really have a shelf life. You
can always refer back to them.
We’re the kind ofband that’s about
being artists, not about making a
sound and duplicating that exact
sound. You can always go listen to
our Blue Album and say, “Oh, it’s
up.” But someday you might go
through something where “The
Last Drag” will mean something
to you. ‘Cause its slower, its more
about life rather than what the other
one might have been about. Plus,
we’ve been together long enough
where we’ve been through a lot of
weird things in the last six years—
and we put it in our music. We’ve
had relatives die and really weird

stuff that’s about life. It's not about
being bouncy and drinking beer in
a bar.
It's just that way. One album
is one album. It’s just like a paint-
ing. If you went to an art gallery
and all the paintings looked the
same you’d be like, “This sucks.”
You appreciate the artists for what
they create as a whole.
Andy: If we put out another album
that sounded just like the first one,

Concert Review

The Samples played to a
crowd of roughly nine hundred
and seventy Davidson students
and visitors Friday night in Love
Auditorium. Their dynamic per-
formance did not disappoint fans
familiar with their CDs. As those

ou appreciate the artists for what
they createasawhole ™

who have never before heard
The Samples in person learned,
the band successfully duplicates
their recorded sound playing
live.

Unlike many of the other
groups that have played at

Davidson and also participated -

in last summer’s HORDE tour (in-

cluding Blues Traveler, Wide-
spread Panic, and Colonel Bruce
Hampton and the Aquarium Res-
cue Unit), The Samples included
few spontaneous jams or solos in
Friday’s show.

They moved succinctly from
song to song with short pauses and
amiable “Thanks” from lead vo-
calist Sean Kelly.

Although their play-list in-
cluded a variety of songs from all
four of their albums, it drew most
heavily from their two most recent

albums: No Room and The Last
Drag. During sound check they
speculated about the crowd’s re-
action to a current band favorite,
“Taking Home,” which along with
many of the other cuts from their
latest CD, was well received dur-
ing the show.

Limited commentary from
Sean Kelly suggested that their
dubious tune, “Darkside,” is about
the perils of sugar addiction and
that “Seany Boy (drop out)” was
written when he dropped out of
high school at the age of sixteen
(roughly seven years ago).

Personal favorites ofthe night
include “Nothing Lasts for Long,"
“Little Silver Ring," and “Birth of
Words.” Overall, the show flowed
well and both the crowd and the
band seemed to have enjoyed the
performance.

there’d be no point . . . at least not
for us.

Sean: But we do want to make a
metal album. Metal, country, and
thrash.

Josh: Soyou guys are pretty happy
where you are right now?

Sean: As long as there’s a sense of
progression in our music and in
our lives . . . that’s cool.

Amy: You don’t have a video and

you don’t have a top 40 song...
Tell me a little bit more about the
video thing and how you feelabout
MTV and its power to popularize
music across the country.

Sean: I think that if I had a forecast
for the future, I think that to me,
they (MTV) seem very arrogant.
It's about to have some competi-
tion soon and I think it’s going to
wake up.

Andy: Yeah. We’ve given them a
video which we made and is very
cool. It’s not a stupid video and
they threw it in the toilet.

Sean: They’re not about music or
videos. They’re about money.
Andy: They’re just a monopoly
right now. But their time will come.
It’s sort of a small scale of what’s
going tohappen to ourcountry. It’s

all just the beginning of the end.

-_| pathetic lack of interest most Americans have for anything of real significance going on

RANDOM NOTES

Apparently, their creative genius extends beyond the musical realm. During our
interview we learned that Sean and Jeep MacNichol (drums, percussion, etc.) had used
Chambers as a backdrop for their latest home movie about a college student mixed-up in
a crazy daydream/reality —the concept of which we didn’t wholly understand . .. maybe,
you had to be there.

We also learned that Al Laughlin (Keyboards, harmony vocals, piano) is the band’s
only meat-eater (that came up via a horrible joke about the Bobbitts—we’ll spare you the
details).

Finally, on the eve of the Olympic Opening Ceremonies, Sean and Andy both seemed
to think that all the attention being given to the Kerrigan-Harding scandal reflects the

in the world.
