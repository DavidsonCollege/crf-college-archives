Freelove Upthumpa's Weekend Workout!

By Freelove Upthumpa

It’s early morning and you’re feel-
ing rough. Not quite sure how to
handle those hangover blues? Try
a good hearty workout! Don’t
worry, this isn’t like that crap
you’ve seen Jane Fonda and the
gang pushing down your throats,
this is the real stuff.

1) You’ ve gotto start off slow,
or you could really do some dam-
age. I recommend you perform
this first exercise while still in bed.
That’s right! Light up a smoke!
Breathe deeply, and be sure to let
that nice healthy breakfast of nico-
tine and tar sink completely into
your lungs. If you haven’t been
trained in this sort of workout
before, then try something easy,
like a Merit Ultra Light, but if you
think you’reready to hang with the
big dogs, break out those filterless
Camels, or even the Lucky Strikes!

2) Now that you’ve gotten
your lungs ready for another day,
it’s time to get down to something
physical: gratuitous sex. Yes,
people, there’s nothing like a good
tussle in the morning to get things
flowing: If you’re alone, well, that
shouldn’t slow you down, just
pretend. f

3) Yes indeedy, the next step
of the daily workout is just what
you’d expect after sex: another
cigarette.

4) You’ ve worked hard so far,
so go and hit the showers.

5) All clean,
and ready to -get
back to work. By
now your partner
from step two
should have gotten
the message tobolt,
but justin case little
lovie cakes is still
hanging around
without a purpose,
there’s always a
room to becleaned.
Remember folks,
I’m not being sex-
ist, women should
engage in a little
domestic pushing
around here for the
sake of equal rights,
Tell that lazy sack
of seminal fluid
you brought home

7)
Well, heck, if
they’ve donea
decent job
cleaning the
room, you
might as well
have some
more sex. It’s
about time for
a little cardio-
vascular
stimulation
anyway.
Don’t forget
to have a
smoke after
you finish,

Party Reviews: By Joe

In a radical departure from its
former policy, The Davidphonian
decided recently to begin review-

ing Davidson’s parties. G. Datty

and I began drinking early Friday
afternoon, and it got a little out of
hand,

Datty passed out about six
o’clock, but I went out for a rock-
ing night on Patterson Court and,
asitturned out, other places. Every

‘house was raising hell, andit tured
out to be very interesting.
~ PhiDelt: LikeI said, we started

drinking early. By the time I went.

out, the beer had given me that
bravery that itseemsso often to do.
I wasn’t really scared at all, even
though I had heard that the athletes
were all celebrating Davidson’s
immanent return to the Southern
Conference and that action’s im-
plications for athletic scholarships.
It turned out, though, that I had
nothing to be scared of.

The football players were mes- _

merized by an intense game of
Crazy Eights, and the only other

people there were international —

students, who were busy hitting
on the four big-haired, blonde-
haired Queens chicks.

While I was there, the music
playing was Trixter, but they were
putting in some ScorpionsasI left.
I would have liked to stay, but Yo!
SPE Raps had already started.

SPE: NWA usually really
gets me off, but watching a bunch
of guys dancing to it with their
girlfriends is enough to make
anyone puke (which, dude, I had
already done because I’m such a
party monster).

I must say, though, that Yo!
SPE Raps is a good party most of
the time, but that night all the
brothers were too busy playing

ping pong to hang out and talk.

I did get to talk to one of the
SPEs, who told me all about his
senior math major project, but his
pirate outfit really confused me.

Tt turns out that he was the
mistaken one, but the net effect
was that I was really disoriented
walking up to PiKA. And when
the DJ put on Tone LocasI wason

American Gladiators on the Fox.
Settle in, light a smoke, and watch
what happens when people take
their workouts too seriously. If
staring at these pumped up muscle
mutants doesn’t convert you to

Freelove’s work-out, nothing will.

the way, I almost lost it. _

PiKA: [had justrecovered from
my trials at the SPE house when I
walked into the sauna they call
PiKA.

Actually, it took me about

twenty. minutes to make my way
throught the crowd of people I had

never seen before. Don’t get me

. wrong, though. They were all re-
ally laid-back and way kind.
Ihave to admit that I was sur-
prised to find out that PiKA was
having a party, but my friend told
me that they had decided to take

some of the money from that lucra-

tive Pike Dog business and Spencer
had promised to pay for some of the
punch, .
The fraternity didn’t tell the
’ Spencer girls it was going to have
liquor in it. Anyway, the music was
pretty good, but all the people were
dancing really strangely. My time
was short, though, with the 2 0’clock
time limit on kegs, so I had to get
over to KA. ae

important to the success of this
workout. Remember, your health
is at stake!

9) You’re up now for the sec-
ond part of the day, and by now,
dammit, you’re hungry. Geton the

phone and call a pledge, because
you deserve it! If you’re female,
it’s time now to make some use out
of that meathead frat-boy again:
tell him to,call one of his pledges.
Threaten celibacy, if necessary.
(Few things matter as much to your
average fraternity man than the
regular release of his manliness.)
While you’ re waiting for that food
to arrive, you might as well get se-
riousand fix yourselfa drink. Hell,
it’s almost 2:00pm by now!

_ 10) Aftera hearty dinner, sev-
eral drinks, and more smokes, it’s
time to go out on the town, or the
courtinour case. This is where the
workout gets tough: fighting the
crowds fora beer, climbing up and
down the stairs, having to gao all
the way outside to urinate, and of
course, the ritualistic dancing on
tables in an attempt to find another
assistant for steps 2, 5, 7, & 9 of
Freclove’s Sunday Work-Out!
