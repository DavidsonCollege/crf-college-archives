Winless Cats Face Bisons

By BILL MORRIS
Sports Writer

The Davidson Wildcats take
an @ and 4 record into Lewis-
burg. Pennsylvania Saturday to
play a Bucknell Bison team
that has won its last two games.

“This could prove to be one
of our toughest games to date.
Their personnel, at certain spots
is as good. if not better, than
we have seen. You have to be
impressed with a team that
scores 32 poinis against a good
Citadel team and should have
won the game.” Coach Dave
Fagg said.

The Bucknell offense is pri-
marily a slot T offense, revolv-
ing around a good quarterback
and two fine runners.

“Harold Burke, the quarter-
back. runs an offense that is
about as good as we will face
all season.’ He is a good passer.
using mainly short tosses. who
has a knack for making things
happen. He completed 22 of 37
passes in The Citadel game.”
Fagg said.

“Their two backs are as good
as we'll sec. Rick Diez. 6-2, 213,
and Mitch Farbsiein, 5-11, 215.
are two good sized .alented
running backs.” he added.

Burke has completed almost
GU per cent of his passes to
date. His favorite target has
been his big tight end, Carl

Probst. 6-2. 215. who has caught
14 passes for an average gain
of 15 yards. and has scored 3
touchdowns.

Fullback Farbstein. coming
off of a 200 vard rushing per-
formance in his las; game, is
averaging almost 6 yards a car-
ry, Halfback Diez has about a
3 yard a carry average. They
complement a good passing
game.

“We'll either go with the split
G, that is, six men on the line.
two linebackers. and the second
ary. or a split 4. with @ four
men tine, two linebackers over
the tackles. two outside, and
cur secondary. Or we may g0
into a pro type 4-3." Fagg said.

“Bucknell will play a split 4
prmiarily. They're a conserva
tive team that will give a little.
but not the big play. Running
will be tough. bul we've gat to
get it going. The type defense
Bucknell plays is good to pass
against and we'll try to do tat.
A lot of it.” he added.

Scotty Shipp will
quarterback Saturday. Rick
Kemmerlin suffered a_ pulled
groin muscle in the Appalachian
game and failed to finish that
game.

Coach Fagg was optimistic
aout the coming game and
the rest of the season in spite
of the early losses and another

underdog role against Buck-
of some games we could have
won,” he said.

We weed tw beat Bucknell
for three reasons. Firs:, we're
0 and 4 and we need a win
badly. Second. we've played
Bucknell four umes now and
been beaten everytime.

“We haven't been playing
that badly. Our defense has
beca exeepiional in spots. fore-
ing five turnovers against Ap
palachian State.

“If we could just put our of-
lense together and get

every:

thing working. We're voung and
inexperienced on offense. and ,
our mistakes have kept us out
win,” he added.

Bucknell’s coach, Fred Pren-
der, apparently agrees.

“Don't seil Davidson short.
Its a fine 0 and 4 team. It's
faced a really rough sched tle.
They have two excetient run.
ners in dohnny Riker: and Bill
Bracken, This is a kcy game for.

With Loss Ta Gamecocks

By ERIC VERNON
Sports Writer

The Davidson Rugby Club
opened its fall season with a
defeat at the hands of the Un-
iversity of South Carolina by
19-0.

The club is optimistic. how-
ever, about their chances in the
upcoming iiatches with such
schools as Clemson, Hampden-
Sydney, and U.N.C. at Chapel
Hill.

The squad will have approx-

imately five more games, most
of which will be away.

Organizer Zack Mobley has
about twenty five players out
for ithe team, fifteen of which
can play at a time.

Zack Mobley, John Devine, Ed
Dietrick, Randy. Webster, Ron
Page, Steve Philips, and Tad
Porter are the nucleus of the
team and are all upper-class-
men.

Exceptional showings by
freshmen Henry Barbera and

Ken Ejler make up a potential-
ly good team,
Mobley.

Practice is held only twice
a week, mainly because of the
uns:ructured nature of the club
and because they are playing
for fun.

The schedule for fall as well
as spring is very tentative, but
about five games are anticipa-
ted in the spring. The next
match is to be held htis week-
end at U.N.C.
