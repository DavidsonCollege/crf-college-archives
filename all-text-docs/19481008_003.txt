first team :
that could hold their own with any eleven. Last year’s 14-0 set-
back was passed off as the result of a couple of bad breaks for
the Wildcats. The ‘year before it was the lack of reserves that’
accounted for the second half collapse of the Red and Black de-
fenders. But this year there'll be no excuses and no defeat.

State plays the vaunted Tar Heels of U.N.C. the week after
the Davidson melee, and will be pointing for revenge for last
year's 41-6 thumping: The Wolfpack came out of last week's

* scrap with Clemson on the short end of a 6-0 score, though they

out-did’ the Palmetto lads in statistics, and bogged down at the
goal. But the biggest blow suffered by the “Cow College” lads
was the loss of flashy tailback Gwyn Fletcher, Fleteher, a Wild-
cat in 1941, received a broken nose early in the Clemson game
and was out the rest of the battle. This probably won't keep him
out of this week’s game, but it should hold him to limited service.

The locals will be aided hy he return of blocking back
Charlie Rimer and end Bill Johnson, Bill Iverson and J. D. Ash-
more have filled in well at the blocking spot and Rimer’s return
will be felt. Johnson will be welcomed at end where only
Buddy Cheek, Hal Mapes, Mike Williams and Mott Price have
been,

The Pack will be installed as favorites by the experts, but
we can’t go along with them. We look for the score to be 12-7
in favor of Jamerson’s men. We'll go farther in repeating last

week’s statement that Davidsen has suffered its first and only
defeat of the season, From now on there'll be Wildcat victories.

Our apologies are extended to Gene Bingham and his staff
of intramural referees for the assertions which we made last
week which were interpreted in a manner other than that. in-
tended, Our purpose was to beseech the arbiters to have a
thorough knowledge of the rules. "We had no™intention—of—he-
litting the work of these boys who give of their time to help in
the school’s athletic program. These boys receive a satary, if
you'd call it that, of forty cents per game, No one ‘can get rich
on that, and we, know that none of these boys are out there simply
to make money. Because of the views expressed in this column
it was felt that this work was not appreciated by the student
body. We hope to squelch that idea and make a plea to any mem-
her of the student body to offer his time.

Bingham has a thankless job of providing officials for all
intra-frat contests and he receives no compensation for it other
than the satisfaction that goes with service. He is particularly
interested in securing those boys who have a knowledge of foot-
ball from playing. Those ineligible beggise of varsity or Jayvee
experience are urged to work. -

But, as we pointed out last week, the fault does not always
arise from any deficiency of the officials. We find that the
players themselves do|not know the rules, and, when called on
some infraction, attack the\referee for showing partiality or
the like. In hope of helping this situation we have printed else-
where on this page a set of the rules governing touch football
play. We ask all to acquaint themselves with them and charge
the sports managers or team captains with seeing that. their
players do know the rules, Also we would remind all that when
any questioning of an official’s decision is to be made, it is to be
made only by the playing captain and not by accusing voices of
the whole team. The referee has a perfect right to extract anyone
from the game or sidelines who is in any way obstructing his
handling of the game,
