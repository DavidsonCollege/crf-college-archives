major faults.

Bringing the issue a little
closer to home, our student}
body has been criticized for its
lack of interest and compla-
cency, and, in some cases, apathy
towards the affairs of the
“outer-Davidson world.”

However, in the courses of-
fered at Davidson, a student in-
terested in the world situation
could get a broad understand-
ing of the world and our trou-
bled age. The History Depart-
ment offers courses in 20th
Century World, Russia since the |
1917. revolution, and United
States History to the present.:
Nevertheless. there is no course’
in the Middle Eastern Countries, '
an area which plays an import-:
ant role in today's affairs.

The Political Science Depart-}
ment, although understaffed.
offers courses in problems of
American foreign policy and the
Communist world. A course in
comparative governments might |
be a desirable addition. Com-
parative Economic Systems and
‘International Economics are of-
fered by the Economics Depart-
ment.

Outside the class room, or-
ganizations such as the IR.C.
try to develop the awareness
of the student body. However,
Jack of funds has made it dif-
ficult for the clubs to bring
speakers of high caliber to cam-
pus. During the year. through
the cooperation of the YMCA,

the Round Table Committee,
and Sigma Delta Pi, two outside

speakers were heard on cam-
pus. A third speaker came with
the Artist Series. It was the ad-
ministration's only effort to
stimulate student body interest

The coming of sixteen new
foreign students to Davidson
will give a new atmosphere to
the campus. With the many
ideas that they will bring, they
will expect a better understand-
ing of their problems, customs,
and way of thinking. Here is
a chance for the student body
to broaden its own outlook
while trying to meet the needs
of our visitors.

dividualism. anti-intellec t ua l-
ism. limited thinking, “the stu-
dent mass with its compelling
and molding atmosphere,” and
the absence of students “who
really enjoy the pursuit of
knowledge.”

Four mentioned such things
as Davidson's isolation, -pro-
vincialism. narrow-mindedness,
lack of liberal thinking among
the faculty, conservatism, and
over-reliance on tradition.

.Faculty policies on such mat-
ters as student conduct and
social life were criticized by
three students, and two students
said that some departments

‘among the faculty were inferi-

or. The lack of challenge to
“higher-level” students and
over-emphasis on grades were
named by two.

Other disadvantages cited
were faculty hypocrisy about
drinking and cheating, the

semester system, “too many ex-
tracurricular activities and too
few social contacts (women),”
and “the pitiful sacrifice and
compromise of Christianity, for
the sake of a supposed all-suf-
ficient cultivation of the mind.”

4. Are you satisfied with

Six students answered this
question in the affirmative.
Fourteen replied negatively.

Board Of Trustees
To Meet On May 15

On May 16 the Board of Trus-
tees will hold its regularly
scheduled semi-annual meeting.
The Executive Committee of the
Board will meet during the aft-
ernoon of May 14. .

At this meeting the Trustees
will formally grant the faculty
the privilege of conferring A.B.
and B.S. degrees on the gradu-
ating seniors. The, faculty has
already given the responsibility
of determining eligibility for
graduation to the registrar and
the two deans. This formality
is carried out automatically
every spring.

In an interview Wednesday
Dr. Pietenpol reaffirmed the
plan of the Trustees to raise
the enrollment of the college
to one thousand. The method
of. increasing the enrollment
has been left to the adminis-
tration. Dr. Pietenpol said that
the administration plans to ad-
mit some twenty extra fresh-
men next year.

The Admissions Committee
must deal with so many variable
factors, such as a student's fail-
ing to enroll-after acceptance,
that it will, be difficult to ad-
mit this exact number. Before
is

a new dormitory, but as yet
there are no plans for one.

The Air Force pilot or navigator is a man of
many talents. He is, first of all, a master of
the air—and no finer exists. In addition, he
has a firm background in engineering, elec-
tronics, astro-navigation and allied fields.
Then, too, he must show outstanding quali-
ties of initiative, leadershipand self-reliance.
He is, in short, a man eminently prepared for
