Divest

was notan easy one for the trustees
to resolve, that even “people of
intelligence and education can
disagree and have different opin-
ions on the matter.”

At about the same time
Davidson was deciding its policy
based on Sullivan’s principles,
Sullivan himself was coming to
the conclusion that his proposal
was ineffective and was doing
nothing to change the status quo in
the country. In June of 1987, he
decried his earlier ideas and called
for total divestment in South Afri-
can business. '

Sophomore Heather McGar-
rah, who last year helped organize
a protest against Davidson’s in-
vestmentin South Africa, finds the
college’s policy- based principles
tobe ironic. “The guy who thought
it up realized it didn’t work,” she
says. “Why can’t the trustees?”

When asked to comment on
the fact that Davidson no longer
has investments in category two
companies McGarrah was pleased,
but cautious. “All the recent
changes (in South Africa) seem to
point to the effectiveness of eco-
nomic sanctions and divestment.

It’s a shame, however, that
Davidson couldn’t have made a
stronger statement against apart-
heid by divesting totally.”

Junior Clement Radebe is from
Soweto and brings a native South
African perspective the situation.
His says that all attempts to fight
apartheid are appreciated.

Inso faras this goes, Category
I companies are better than com-
panies which donot make any anti-
apartheid efforts. According to
Radebe though, the bottom line is
that relatively few blacks and non-
whites work for such companies.

“Blacks don’t really benefit
from any foreign investment,” he
says. Radebe adds that there is not
and never have been enough bene-
fit to blacks and non-whites to
justify the support foreign invest-
ment gives, however inadvertently,
to a government which practices
apartheid.

Radebe agrees with McGarrah
that economic pressures have
helped to bring about recent
changes in his homeland. He re-
mains suspicious of the perma-
nence of the reforms though. Inthe
end he believes that no matter what
investors sucha Davidson do, only
anew constitution and enfranchise-
ment for all will open a door to a
new beginning for his people. “One
man, one vote - that’s our ultimate
goal.”

degree in physics from Whitworth
College in Spokane, Washington,
Reasoner took part in a semester
aborad program in Central Amer-
ica in the spring and summer of
1979. The experience led to an
interest in the region that has con-
tinued to this day.

Reasoner urged Davidson stu-
dents to beinvolved, either through
solidarity groups or churches.
“There are great interconnections
of issues. The peace and justice
needed. abroad have connections
back home to the problems of the
homeless and drugs,” said Rea-
soner. “Involvement allows you to
know more about yourself, society
and the world. It helps complete a
more well-rounded education, not
just for the mind but for the heart.””

Election

sometimes joined by Charlotte
mayor Sue Myrickas they attacked
Gantt’s ‘liberal’ ideas and accused
Gantt of running a campaign of
lies.

All of this campaigning even-
tually led to Tuesday. It was evi-
dent that North Carolinians had
followed the Senatorial campaign
closely as they came to the polls in
record numbers.

As the votes were being
counted Tuesday night, a problem
with the voting machines caused
the polls to remain open to eight
o’clock in Guilford County and to
as late as ten in Durham. Even
though these polls were still open,
returns started coming in and
Helms had an early ten percent
lead over Gantt.

A number of Davidson stu-

* dents attended both the Helms and

Gantt parties in Raleigh on Tues-
day. Although festive at first, the
mood at the North Raleigh Hilton,
Democratic Headquarters for the
night, became somber as more
precincts reported and Helms kept
his lead.

Junior Kim Cartron was at the
Hilton and commented upon the
race by saying, “Helms has preyed
upon the prejudices of people.” As
Helms continued to hold his lead
she said that this is, “disappointing
for North Carolina beacause this
state needs to follow an agenda
like that of Harvey Gantt.”

Around 11:00 Helms gave his
victory speech across town at the
Republican Headquarters even
though not all of the precincts had
reported. Sophomore Seth
McLaughlin attended the Republi-
can headquarter activities. “The
whole atmosphere was pretty jubi-
lant the entire night because Helms

was ahead from the start, “ said
McLaughlin.

At ten of twelve, Harvey Gantt
appeared to his crowd and even
though he did not officially con-
cede defeat, he admitted being hurt
and everyone knew that Jesse
Helms had been re-elected.

Although Helms led by eight
and ten percentage points most of
the night, he won by six percent,
receiving 53% of the vote to Har-
vey Gantt’s47%. The late surge by
Gantt was probably due to the late
returns of Durham and other met-
ropolitan areas whose votes were
notcounted until the early hours of
the morning.

Anthony Foxx visited Gantt’s
headquarters and acknowledged
that Gantt never accepted defeat
until the next day. “He was a little
discouraged from about 10:00 on,”
said Foxx, “but we always looking
for a sign of hope. Unfortunately,
the sign never came.”

McKelway, a native of Dur-
ham, graduated from Davidson in
1954 with an A.B. degree in his-
tory. He wenton toreceive a B.D.
in theology from Princeton Theo-
logical Seminary anda Th.D. from
the University of Basel in 1963.

1955 to 1960 before entering the
world of academic theology in
1963. He taught at Dartmouth
College before returning to
Davidson in 1965. —

McKelway’s primary focus at
Davidson is systematic theology,
as well as modern theology and the
reformation. He has written two
books: The Systematic Theology of
Paul Tillich, published in 1964,
and The Context of Contemporary
Theology, published in 1974.
Another book, The FreedomofGod
and Human Liberation, will be
published next year.

byterian Church, currently chair-
ing its committees on interpreta-
tion and ordination examination.

Poverty

made less than $10,000 a year, and
the average annual income ran
between $12,000 and $13,000.
The overwhelming majority of
families in these neighborhoods
are black. In a separate presenta-
tion for Mecklenburg Ministries,
Hicks reported that two-thirds of
Charlotte’s poor are black, while
blacks make up less than one-third
of Charlotte’s total population. |
He also found that poverty
increasingly plagues female-
headed households. “In the past 25

years,” Hicks wrote, “the ratio of
female-headed families to male-
headed ones in the U.S. has in-
creased dramatically. Due to the
feminization of poverty, child
poverty increased as children were
growing up in single-parent fami-
lies.”

Most of the study respondents
were women, divided almost
equally into categories of married,
widowed or separated. “The fem-
inization of poverty is starkly re-
vealed in this data,” said Ratliff.
The average number of children in
each home was 2.6.

As for education, every respon-
denthad been to school, butasixth —
never completed elementary
school. Their illiteracy rate was
seven percent, and fewer than half

had completed high school. From
this survey and other research,
Hicks was surprised to learn that a
high school diploma allows an
individual to earn about $4,500
more in the job market each year
than a person not completing high
school. ;

Nearly two-thirds of the re-
spondents feel that their education
isinsufficientand practically all of
these would like additional educa-
tion, said Ratliff. Lack of time and
lack of money are the reasons given
by the non-elderly for not going
back to school.

Hicks wasinterested in the type
of work that these heads of house-
holds might do. He found that 50
percent worked in services, an-
other 22 percent.in manufacturing

and 23 percent in construction and
other odd jobs.

A third of the respondents did
not work at all during the preced-
ing two years, primarily because
of retirement or adisability. Ratliff
explained that even if a person is
working, he or she may not always
get enough hours to constitute a
full-time job. Oneinterviewee, who
was in a labor pool and walked
each day to the location where he
hoped to get work, told a volun-

teer, “I got work only two days last”

week, seven hours on Tuesday and
eight hours on Friday, at $4.25 per
hour.”

Despite the economic and
educational barriers they face,
Ratliff found that the “majority of
the respondents find life to be

meaningful and are optimistic
persons of hope and tremendous
faith. In general,” he said, “they do
not blame others for their current
situation and realize they cannot
trustluck toimprove the situation.”

Still, Ratliff’s report voices a
call for reform. “Poverty is a con-
dition that includes not only low
income and disappointing employ-
ment opportunities, but also a low
sense of worth and self-respect and
alow degree of freedom to control
one’s own destiny,” he wrote. —

“To have a segment of the
population condemned to. this
condition, possessing little influ-
ence and power and even looked
down on by their fellow-citizens,
is ablight upon society that is none
other than scandalous.”
