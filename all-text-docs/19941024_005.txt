Spades for
AIDS benefits
Names Quilt

By Dax Cross

Large numbers of students sat
tensely at tables, trying to figure
out strategies for success. These
people were not studying for mid-
term exams but ’participating in a
fun benefit forthe NAMES Project
AIDS Memorial Quilt.

The Spades for AIDS tourna-
ment took place Monday night and
Tuesday afternoon in the 900 room
of the Union. . Forty-two teams
participated in the competition,
which was won by seniors Steve
Krause and Kamil Shah, who re-
ceived NAMES Project t-shirts.
The losers of first round matches
competed in a consolation tourna-
ment, won by juniors Jessica Kahn

and Collie Bryan. Organizers said -

that the matches went smoothly
and everyone had fun.

Each participant paid an entry
fee of five dollars in order to com-
pete. Proceeds from the tourna-
ment went to four local AIDS sup-
port organizations. The 900 Room
also donated profits from bar sales
to the fund. The $500 donated to

AIDS charities was a part of a .

larger effort toraise enough money
to bring the NAMES Project AIDS
Memorial Quilt to Davidson No-
vember 10 through 13. The tour-
nament was organized by Reach
Out and headed up by Elizabeth
Fleming and Mark Riley.

If you are interested in be-
coming involved with the NAMES
Project, either fill out the form
which all students received in the
mail or call -2176. Many volun-
teers are still needed.

The Confederate Flag

is not the only flag with

a controversy
SWARTHMORE, PA—The
U.S. flag is once again flying
‘over Swarthmore College, and
like the original saga of the Stars
and Stripes, this unfurling didn’t
take place without a fight.

Last April, members of the
Conservative Union, a new Re-
publican student organization on
campus, donated a flag to fly
above the Swarthmore adminis-
tration building. Although the
school had an American flag fly-

Old Glory had been missing from
the center of campus since the
1960s.

Then the protests poured in..

The College Democrats ob-
jected to the move, saying that
the action seemed to imply that
the Republicans had a lock on
patriotism. The Socialist Politi-
cal Action Collective said the
decision to raise the flag was an-
other example of American im-
perialism. Some international and
minority students objected to the
flag itself, saying it symbolized
oppression in foreign lands and
at home. Finally, some students
objected to the flag-raising deci-
sion, saying it was not decided on
democratically by the student
body.

Still, last spring, the flag went
up. Butduring the summer, some-
one snagged the flag.

Finally, after a poll indicat-
ing that students wanted the flag
i over campus, the flag was put up.

Chocolate Overdose? Beware

ing atop the athletic fieldhouse,

of the red light...
WASHINGTON, D.C.—It was
one of those days. You had a
Pop-Tart and Pepsi for break-
fast, a Big Mac for lunch, and
managed to take full advantage
of “Mexican Buffet Night” at
your college cafeteria.

Want to know the damage?
At SUNY-Plattsburgh, students
need only walk up to their caf-
eteria computer to get the full
nutritional scoop on their daily
diet.

The Nutrient Netwone de-
veloped by Marriot Management
Services, tallies daily intake of
calories, cholesterol, protein,
saturated fat and carbohydrates
after a student punches in his or
her daily menu.

A green light indicates that
the student’s percentage of daily -
allowances are in an acceptable
range, a yellow light signifies
“borderline,” and the red light
signals that there is “cause for
alarm.”

The computer program first
was tested at the SUNY-
Plattsburgh campus cafeteriaand
is being introduced at other cdm-
puses nationwide. -

Raw chicken and beer bottles
thrown at cheerleaders
IOWA CITY, IA—Flying raw
chicken and beer bottles from
the student section at Kinnick —
Stadium has forced University
of Iowa cheerleaders to seek. a
safer place to perform.

There were no injuries dur-
ing the Iowa-Michigan game,
but the ongoing problem has
caught the eye of those in charge

Academic and Educa-
tional Policy, Buildings and
Grounds, Institutional Advance-
ment, Athletic Policy, Student Life,
Admissions and Financial Aid, and
Finance and Budget.

Rosenbach says, “I feel confi-
dent that we will get representa-
tion on at least four of the seven
committees, but it’s possible that
we could get the whole package.”
He expects to receive representa-
tion on the Athletic Policy, Stu-
dent Life, and Admissions and Fi-
nancial Aid committees.

Rosenbach is fairly confident -
that a representative will be al-
lowed on the Buildings and

' Grounds Committee, and also pos-
sibly on the Institutional Advance-
ment Committee, which deals
mainly with college fundraising.

He does not expect to receive
student representatives on the Fi-
nance and Budget or Academic
and Educational Policy commit-
tees—the former because “the
trustees seem to feel that commit-
tees that are highly technical won't
be benefited by students represen-
tatives,” and the latter because
“they deal with many tenure is-
sues.” Rosenbach sees the outlook
as good. “I was actually surprised
how receptive many of the trustees
were to the proposal,” he says.
