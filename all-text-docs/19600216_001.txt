DAVIDSON COLLEGE. DAVIDSON, N.C. TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1960

Of Davidson's Destiny

The Board of Trustees of Davidson College is a legal corporate body, established
in 1838 by an act of the Legislature of North Carolina, granting all fights to control
and supervise the college and to be the'legal owner of college property. Originally:
limiled to forty-eight in number, the board can now expand its membership to a

maximum size of one hundred.

All but twelve are elected
from the Presbyteries of Albe-
marle, Asheville, Bethel, Con-
cord, Fayetteville, Greenville.
Kings Mountain Mecklenburg,
Orange, Wilmington, Winston-
Salem, Florida, St. Johns, Sewa-
nee, Westminster, Everglades,
and others that may become as-
suciated with Davidson College.
The remaining twelve are elect-
ed by the Alumni Association.

In his book, Memories of Dav-
vidson College, the late Dr.
Walter L. Lingle asks, “What. . .
are the functions of the trus-
tees? They should first of all
elect the president of the col-
lege. . ., the professors and
other administrative officers. ..,

determine the general policies
and objectives of the college.”
This responsibility includes the
constitution -and laws of the
college.

The trustees are elected for
four year periods, staggered
so that one fourth go out of
office cach year. Mectings are

held on the third Wednesday
in February and on the third

Thursday in May, and any
other time a meeting is called.
The cssential officers of the
board are the president, the
vice-president, the secretary,
and the treasurer, There are
five standing eommitiees: fi-
nance; buildings and grounds;
education; student health ser-
vice and. physical education;

McDowell

Richards

Meets WF Tomorrow

Dr. J. McDowell Richards, President of the Board
of Trustees, will discuss the philosophy of education at
Davidson in an open meeting of the Westminster Fellow-
ship tomorrow night at seven o’clock. The meeting, to
be held in the Student Lounge of the College Church,
will open with brief, informal remarks by Richards who
will then entertain questions and comments from the

floor.

Students will be able to dis-
cuss the race issue and the mat-
ter of curriculum with the
Trustee's President. The treat-
ment of the topic, however, is
slated to cover many broad as-
peets of the “Davidson Educa-
tion” including the Faculty
Oath, the relationship of aca-
demic freedom and Christian
education, and the relationship
of Davidson to the Presbyter-
ian Church.

INFORMAL

“All of these questions are
important and they certainly
merit our careful considera-

tion,” Richards noted. “So far
as time permits, I shall be glad
to deal with questions which
the members of the group wish
to ask.” Richards continued
that he would be unable to pre-
pare an adequate formal con-
sideration of the topic but that
he would be glad to come and
discuss some of the issues in-
formally.

Dr. Richards is currently
President of Columbia Theologi-
cal Seminary in Decatur, Geor-
gia. He is an Alumni Trustee
(Class of 1922) and was elected
President of the Board of Trus-
tees in 1940. After graduation
from Davidson, he attended
Princeton (M.A.), and Oxford
(B.A, M.A.). He also holds a
degree of Bachelor of Divinity
from Columbia Seminary and

an honorary doctorate from
Davidson.

CHRISTIAN EDUCATION

“We feel. that as President
of the Board of Trustees, the
question of the philosophy of
education here should be one
of Dr. Richard’s greatest con-
cerns," Henry Shue, Program
Chairman of the Westminster
Fellowship commented. ‘We
hope to arrive at a better un-
derstanding of what  distin-
guishes a Christian Education
from a secular one. Is a church
college simply an instrument of
the church or is it an institu-
tion with its own integrity?
Can a church college have as its
goal the production of Christian
men without making its curric-
ulum a. conditioning process?—
these are some of the questions
we hope to discuss.”

MANY ISSUES

Shue continued that “al-
though some problems such as
the Segregation Decision of the
Trustees are foremost in our
minds, the group will discuss
many issues and not limit their

. scope.

“We hope that by such pro-
grams the Trustees and students
can come to have a common un-
derstanding of our problems.
Then we can work together to
bring about positive solutions.”

The Westminster group has
previously sponsored a discus-
sion by Alumni Trustee Robert
W. Gorrell of Winston-Salem.
At that time he indicated that
the Trustees were seriously in-
terested in becoming better in-
formed about student opinion.
Gorrell had served as a major-
ity member of the committee
which drew up the decision on
the racial qualifications for ad-
mission to Davidson.

“The group was heartened by
the sincerity and openness with
which Mr. Gorrell spoke, he
seemed genuinely interested
in how the students feel,” Shue
noted. “We hope that other
speakers such as Dr. Richards
can also help us in our efforts
to apply the Christian ethic to
all phases of life.”

Dr. Lingle stated: “The ideal
for any institution is that the

ty. students, alumni, and pa-
trons should al] work together.
in the perfect harmony for the,
well-being of their institution
and for the accomplishment of

“No statement.”

“I do not wish lo make a

“No comment.”

But the consensus was that
with the Trustees’ meeting on
Wednesday on the campus, it
was not an appropriate time
to make a statement on this
matter.

Those declining to speak at
present included President Mar-
tin, Dean Johnston, Dean Bai-
ley, Dr. Patterson, Dr. Puckett,
Dr. Davidson, Dr. Jackson, Dr.
Abernethy, and Dr. Workman.

Workman, who presented the
integration-segregation poll to

the faculty, gave his reasons .

for not voicing an opinion at
this time.

“1 do not think that the
members of the faculty
should make any = further
statement until the Trustees
are informed of the faculty
decision in tho faculty poll,”
said the psychology profes-
sor. “l think any action prior
to this would bo-discourteous

Several members of the facul-

ty and administration limited
their comments to brief state-
ments.

Mrs. J. B. Moore, director of}
dormitories, ventured wheré'
many of her masculine contem. '
poraries were reluctant to|
tread,

“Since this is a private col-
lege,” she said, “it is up to the
Trustees to decide whether to
integrate or not. Considering all
aspects of college life, includ-

relations, I do not think that
integration would be a happy
thing at present.”

Colonel Adams agreed with
Mrs. Moore that “a private
institution can exclude any
one that if wants.”

Dr. McCutchan was more

terse. “ It is a problem that| Way consider the matter of ad- ty-four favored integration but

the Trustees are responsible |
for," he said, “and I for one
am very glad that it is their
problem and not mine.”

Dr. Maloney had this to say:

“1 am not in ogreement
with the Trustee’s statement.
1 feel that integration will
take place in society. | be-
lieve that the Church should
take the lead in solving the
problems of integration.

“The Christian is respons-

Said Dr. J. B. Evans, “As a
‘lame-duck’ member of the
Faculty my word means even
I6ss than it formerly did.
However, I cannot help but
express my hope that the
Trustees will give additional,
serious thought and study to
the problem. It is my judg-
ment that for the long-term
good of the College their
stand should be reversed.”
Dr. M. E. Polley remarked
(hat “1 personally believe Dav-
idson, as a church-reldted col-
lege, ought to admit qualified
students. regardless of color
or race. There are, however,
many social problems connected
with such a decision. It is my

Student Poll Reveals
Views On Seeregation

(Editor’s Note: We hesitate to print the results of
this poll because .of numerous reports of extensive
ballot stuffing. However, while we cannot guarantee
the accuracy of this poll, we do feel that it gives some
indication of student opinion.) .

One weck ago THE DAVIDSONIAN took a poll to
determine student body opinion on the question of
admission of Negroes to Davidson College. During chapel
last Tuesday morning the students completed the polls,
ing dormitory life and social; which had been placed in the hymn racks. This poll was

cember.

There were 647 replies to the
poll. Of these, 297 checked the
statement, “I believe that Dav-
idson College should not in any

mission of Negroes.”

On the other hand, 121 felt
that Davidson should  inte-
grate “at the earliest possible
date,” and that “the Trustees
(should) form a joint Trustee-
Administration-Faculty - Stu-
dent committee to discuss the
full implications of this posi-
tion.

after the dftérnoon session is
adjourned. The trustees as a
group have net seen the Presi-
dent's House since it was re-
modeled and refurnished. last
summer.

While on the campus, many
of the trustees. will participate
in other activities. Dr. Richards
is speaking to the Westminster
Fellowship tomorrow night: Al- .
so, a group of trustees has con-
sented to mect with student
groups to discuss the Board's
decision last February that it
was not to the best interests of
Davidson to admit Negroes as
students at this time. (See other
stories on this page.)

Trustees

Discuss Racial Stand

Ten Davidson students have arranged for a number
of small private meetings with members of the Board
of Trustees to discuss the admissions policy of the col-
lege in regard to,race. These meetings are being held
fonight and at various times tomorrow.

“We sent out letters last week
to every member of the Board,
inviting them to meet personal-
ly with us and diseuss the is-
sue,” explained Henry Shue,
acting secretary for the group.
“We have definitely scheduled
meetings with seven men, after
receiving nineteen replies.”

The other students who are
participating in these programs
are Knox Abernethy, David Ed-
wards. Allen Gravely, Bert Kel-
ler, Pete Kellogg, Dave Mullen,
David Robinson, Joe Verreault
and Larry Wells.

THE CHRISTIAN ETHIC

“Our purpose is to work to.
ward an admissions policy that
will witness more effectively to
the relevance of the Christian
ethic than does last February's
decision of the Board,” Shue
said. ‘We respect the Board of
= but we hope that the

SE SnIner e

last word has not been said for
the present time.

‘If Davidson is a Christian
college in any meaningful
sense, we think its handling of
this issue should unequivocally
reflect this fact.”

In addition to discussions set
definitely in trustee responses,
the group is confident of talk-
ing with considerably more
men, who either did not have
time to reply, could not arrange
a time, or wanted to check with
other Board members first.

TRUSTEE PARTICIPANTS

The scheduled meetings are
with the following trustees: R.
K. Gregory, Dr. B. Frank Hall,
Walter L. Lingle, Ir, Rev. M. C.
MacQueen. Rev. Albert B. Me-
Clure, Rev. Roscoe L. Prince
and Dr. W. T. Thompson.

‘Others were interested but
said they did not have time for
the meetings, while another
group expressed agreement
with the ultimate objectives but
did not feel that the suggested

type of discussion would be ef-
{ective.

A ‘third group declined to
‘meet because they felt strongly
that the issue should not be re-
opened at all.

TRUSTEE RESPONSES

“The responses represented a
wide range of opinions,” Shue

commented. “The most enthus-

iastie reply called our meetings
‘a. great idea’. The other oxt-
reme was thaf no further action
or investigation should be made.
into the matter.

“One man responded that our
proposed action would be posi-
tively detrimental and would
ruin what is now a great institu-
tion. Another said that our
opinion represented the feeling
of a very small minority and
that only views of groups large.
enough to express themselves
through more ‘normal channels’
need to be considered.”

Shue pointed out that the ma-
jority of letters showed an in-
terest in hearing student opin-
ions. His group is hopeful that
other students will also carry
this matter to members of the
Board,

“The President's Office was
very helpful in supplying ad-
dresses and other information,
but we want to emphasize that
this program is solely ‘our re-
sponsibility.” Shue said.

RECONSIDER RESOLUTION

“We hope very much that the
trustees will see fit to recon-
sider their resolution, but at
the present time we have no
definite plans as a group of
what ‘to do if they do not re-
open the matter.

“However, we were hearten-
ed by the number of responses
from trustees who said that
though they had supported the
resolution, they were not con-
fident in their own minds and
hoped to study the issue fur-
ther.”
