Unique Program Strikes Fear
To Hearts Of Davidson
Students

A startling and grim drama-
tization of H. G. Wells’ play,
“The War of the *Worlds,”
struck stark terror into the
hearts of many Davidson stu-
dents here last Sunday night.

Many of the students didn't
realize that the play was a dramati-
zation of pure and rushed
frantically to the rooms of other

coming an Other boys
joined them in their fears or either

announcements that

heard
radio were from
a fiction play and that there was
no real danger at all.

Several dropped to their
knees and began to pray before
the broadcast was over. A group
of Davidson students returning
from Asheville and listening to
what they thought were news radio
bulletins their car
the kneeled beside
the road to pray fervently along
with other people who had stopped
their cars.

Calls made over the tele-
phones by terrified boys to parents
who were far away to assure them-
selves that their families were safe

from the intrusions of the “men
from Mars.”

Even a few of the professors
were frightened during the pro-

gram and it has been reported that
the wife of one of the professors.
fainted while listening to realistic
tragedy portrayed in the dramati-
zation, although CBS «states that
it wds announced four times dur-
ing the program that the dramati-

zation was purely fictional.
Many students and other people
were greatly indignant when the

hubbub subsided and it was learned
by many who had been so terror-
stricken that the reports which they

had heard were from a fiction
play being, dramatizéd by Orsen
Welles on “The Mercury Theater

of the Air.”
Senator Clyde L. Herring, Dem-
ocrat from Iowa, was so indignant
that he said he planned to intro-
duce a bill in Congress “controlling
just such abuses as was heard over
the radio last night Radio has
no more right to present programs
like that than has in

Dear Bill:
Now it's our turn to be mad.

“Fed-Up” hadn’t any right to use
a “we” for his and only his singu-

mind is that of an egoist who must
have thought himself worthy of

“Fed-Up,” why didn’t you have
the nerve to sign such an outland-
ish statement? I why; the
Davidson student body would have
such an intense

you leave the better. Can’t you take
