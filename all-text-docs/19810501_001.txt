Proposal for women’s athletic scholarships aired

By FRANCES PALMER
Asst. News Editor

A group of woman athletes
has drawn up a proposal recom-
mending that the College hire
an assistant athletic director of
women’s athletics, grant scho-
larships for women’s basket-
ball, and consider upgrading
present clvb teams to the
varsity level.

Senior Kirby: Owen, who or-
ganized the group, said they
presented their proposals to the
President’s Advisory Council
on Intercollegiate Athletics on
April 13. The Council met
Tuesday morning to discuss the
recommendations.

Council Chairman David Shi
said the Council’s reactions to
the group were ‘‘favorable to
both their concerns and their
specific recommendations.’’ Al-
most all of the proposals were
received ‘‘sympathetically ,”’ Shi
added.

Owen, who is also a member
of the council, said, however,
that the council has not yet
decided what recommendations,
if any, they will make to College
President Samuel Spencer.
They are ‘‘still in the first
stage’ of reviewing the pro-
posals, she said.

The council hopes to present

their views to college President
Samuel Spencer early next
week. Spencer will present his
own recommendations to the
Board of Trustees next Thurs-
day.

Athletic Director Gene Bing-
ham, who attended the April 13
meeting is in favor of initiating
a scholarship program for wo-
men’s basketball. Bingham’s
tentative plan is to award funds
for one full basketball scholar-
ship in the 1981-82 school year.
The group recommended that
the funds be divided at the
coach’s discretion among sev-
eral players.

The group strongly urged the
College to begin offering wo-
men’s athletic scholarships. ‘‘It
is obvious that the program at
its present level cannot be com-
petitive.”

Scholarships would change
the basketball team’s status
from Division III to Division
II, so that all five of the
College’s women’s teams would
compete in Division II.

Shi said the council has not
yet decided whether or not to
recommend hiring a new assis-
tant athletic director for wo-
men’s athletics. They question
if the College could ‘‘accomplish
the same objectives without

creating another administrative
position.’’ He feels there is ‘‘not
enough to do to warrant (hiring)
someone only for that.’

Owen, however, thinks that
hiring an assistant athletic dir-
ector for women’s athletics is
important for the future of the
program.

In addition to overseeing
the entire women’s program,
the new director could work
with Physical Education and
Intramural Director Sterling
Martin and Assistant Athletic

Maydole petitions

Ratio comes under fire

By LISA DRAINE
Staff Writer

‘“We, the undersigned, ask
the Board of Trustees to adopt
the following motion:

That the Board of Trustees
adopt an admissions policy
based on merit which does not
discriminate on the basis of
sex.”

Philosophy Professor Robert
Maydole will present this peti-
tion to the faculty at their
meeting next Tuesday. Fifty-
five of the College’s 100 faculty
members have already signed
the petition.

Under the Constitution of the
College the faculty may with a
majority vote petition the
Board of Turstees for direct
action. Maydole hopes the
Trustees will consider the peti-
tion at their meeting next week.

The Trustees established a 2
to 1 male/female admissions

‘ratio for the College in 1976.

oe

The admissions ratio is ‘‘a
fundamentally moral issue
which goes to the very heart of
humanity,” according to May-
dole. He said he has always
considered the policy morally
wrong but until now has ‘‘stood
by with benign neglect without

speaking out.”

Maydole said he believes the
faculty is now committed to
eliminating the rigid ratio.

Admissions Director John
Griffith said he supported May-
dole’s position and welcomed
the petition as an indication of
faculty concern.

Next Thursday Griffith will

. request that the Trustees re-

evaluate the College’s admis-
sion policy. ‘‘The time has come
to look at the policy again,”
Griffith said.

If the Trustees agree to
re-evaluate present policy, Grif-
fith said he will compile a report
on the process and impact of
possible policy changes, includ-
ing changes in the male/female
ratio.

The number of female appli-
cants has increased in recent
years, Griffith noted. Because
demographic trends indicate
that more and more women will
enter higher education in the ~
future, the College will probably
find the 2 to 1 ratio difficult to
maintain.

The President’s Advisory
Council on Admissions and
Financial Aid will meet in the
next few days to discuss Grif-
fith’s plans, according to Coun-

Black Student Coalition protests KA Old South

By TIM WHALEN
News Editor

“Because of the past 200 odd
years of white racism and the
present white racism experi-
enced by Blacks, the feelings of
anger, anguish, hate, hurt...will
ALWAYS exist and will most
certainly be evoked when sym-
bols of white racism are dis-
played.’’ So said the Black
Student Coalition (BSC) in a
flier they distributed last
evening protesting Kappa Al-
pha Fraternity’s (KA) Old

Weekend. KA will hold Old

South off campus this- weekend.

“Our interest is not racist,”
KA President Eric Crum said.
Crum added he and KA mem.-;
bers do not, view Old South
Weekend, the fraternity’s tradi-
tional costume ball, as a symbol
of white racism, but as a

celebration of KA’s gentleman-—

ly and chivalrous heritage.

The BSC’s protest grows out
of a meeting between five BSC
members and five KA members
set up by Crum last Wednesday.

Crum said he called the meeting

discuss relations between the |
two organizations, and especial-
ly their differing views of Old
South. Kennebrew and Crum
both said the meeting was
valuable in opening up commu-
nications between the two
groups. Kennebrew said, ‘‘It
was very valuable because when
we went into it I don’t think
they were really aware of how
we feel about Old South. They
were open to us, and we got

Inequitable facilities, scant funds and lack of publicity irk women athletes

By EDITH PARKER
Staff Writer

“The progress has been inexcusably slow. .
long can they say, ‘we’ve just gone coed?’ ”’

Women’s tennis and swimming coach Pat Miller's
comments seem to sum up the frustration felt by
woman athletes and coaches about the growth of the
College’s women’s athletics program.

The program began in 1973-74 with the formation of

.How

Focus

a basketball and a tennis team, both with volunteer
coaches. Since then, it has become a five team program
which includes basketball, tennis, track, cross country
and field hockey. This year the field hockey team was
nationally ranked and the tennis team won the state
championship. Yet athletes feel the program has not
developed quickly énough in many areas.

The recommendations presented to the President’s
Advisory Council on Intercollegiate Athletics by a

group of woman athletes list some of the athletes’ hopes
for the future (see article above). Most athletes and
staff members cited inequitable use of facilities, lack of
publicity, and insufficient funds for recruiting as major
problems in the women’s athletics program.

Facilities

Some women athletes have complained of discri-
minatory treatment in the use of sports facilities. For
example, the women’s tennis team has had difficulty in
the last few years obtaining permission to use the upper
tennis courts.

Traditionally, the men’s team has used the upper
courts while the women’s team has played on the lower
ones. Actording to senior Anne Stanback, the upper
courts are available only to the men’s varsity tennis
team and the faculty.

The lower courts are available for general use, which
‘‘hurts the quality of the courts.” The lower courts are
also less visible, have only one set of bleachers, no
water fountains, and no trash cans, she added.

An independent committee which evaluated the
entire athletic program a year ago reported that the
College’s only problem with tennis facilities is ‘‘how to

better share the use of the tennis house and better
courts between men and women.”
This spring the team encountered difficulty during
what one player termed the “biggest match of the
ear.’
* According to Stanback, several team members asked
Assistant Athletic Director Tom Couch if the team
could use the upper courts since the men’s;tennis team
