“The: long-run solution to |-
bike theft is tied to the need to
provide an adequately funded,
secure place for bicycling as a
prominent form of tran-
sportation in our society,” .
said Gulley. ‘We hope that our .

some more immediate, in-

This was reflected in that:

Coach Brickels’ attitude
towards basketball has
changed our squad into a
cohesive unit. He is a man who
not only wields authority |
(every coach has that), but in

addition commands respect.
He’s a guy you cannot help but

like. People who view prac-.

haired coach, that if he sud-

‘denly turned to the spectators
and told them to run a mile,
they would probably do it.

Why is it so important that
we’re a team? Obviously, one
reason is that it helps
everybody involved. However,
in the case of Davidson it is
even more important because
we are a team’ that is depen-

Girls Ready For Second Season

‘By CARLYLE SHERRILL
Staff Writer

After posting a 9-3 record |
‘ast year in their initial |

eason, the Davidson girls’ .

asketball team will enter |
| heir second season with high
»xpectations. |

‘Coaching the girls this year |
are IMAC stars Joe Duncan,
! Charlie:Slagle and Ken Sch-
mader.

The only, major loss fecats|
last year’s team was Katie
Early, a strong front court per- ;
former. Also mi from‘
last year is Ann Holland from

tee sons this year hal

include 16 regular seasonj!
games and the North Carolina.
State Girls’ Basketball “B” ,
Tournament. Davidson would |
have been in the.“‘A”: tour-|
nament but it was too ex. |
pensive and came during \-
vacation. Three of the games |

eee

sity games.°Several new add-
itions to the schedule promise}
to make it much tougher than .

last year’s, Duncan indicated. ,

Duncan and Slagle plan to |

install a pressure defense and
a fast-breaking offense. The
girls will use a full court press
on occasion while basically
employing the 2-1-2 and 1-2-2:
zones.

Slagle explained that the
girls plan to capitalize on their |
excellent team speed by fast-
breaking often. ‘Ded Booth,
Donna Sherrill, Bonnie
Caulkins and Ginny { Jewell
will be heavily relied upon to
clear the boards and start the
fast breaks,” Slagle said.

The team is made up
basically of freshmen and |
sophomores with only one
senior and two juniors.

With All-Male Coaching Staff _

Duncan. and Slagle were
quick to praise the team’s
overall
mental attitude.

According to Duncan, ‘‘We
have a lot of talent with
everyone back from last year
_ except Katie, and the addition
of Rene Soos, a transfer from

UNG, will greatly i improve the |
ita added that, “Every

game we play will be a good
basketball e, perhaps bet- .
ter than most people would ex-

pect. We have a good schedule _

and any time we play there

will be two good teams on the

court.”’

and excellent

Davidson may not have the
talent N.C. State has, man for
man. We have no height in the "
center position, and while our
rebounding strength lies in our
forwards , we don’t have the
height in that position a team
such as Carolina has. David-
son can beat those teams. Our.
squad can out-hustle any other |
team. Our squad may not have
the shooting other teams have
but by working together each
member can work together to
take the high percentage
shots.

We can win! And what’s
more, we will. I believe this

year we’re going to storm the .
Southern

Conference and get
past the NCAAregionals. __
The key teams for us this
year are St. John’s, South
Carolina, Furman and Rich-
mond. I believe that Rich-
mond and Furman are the
only two teams that should ap-
proach our standard of play
this year in the conference.
The reasons I have included
South Carolina and St. John’s
are as follows: South Carolina
promises to be as tough or
tougher this year than last
thanks to the return of Alex
English and Bob Mathias. It
would seem that this team will
almost certainly receive an

NCAA bid to the tournament.
A victory over the Gamecocks
in South- wea would cer-
tainly put lure on
them when we meet them in
Charlotte to see who repre-
sents this region in the NCAA.

As far as St. John’s is con-
cerned, I believe a victory

over them would really in-

dicate what a gaod team we
have. St. John should finish in
the top. ten this year. If we
beat St. John’s (whom we
meet after State, UCLA and
Notre Dame), it will mean
that we would have reached a
point where it would be
feasible for us to do well in the
NCAA tournament.

A quick glance at the team
itself shows that we are
Strong. Eppa Rixey and
Sheldon Parker continue to
battle for center spot, while
Greg Dunn, Jay Powell, and
Larry Horowitz should exhibit
play that will place all on the
Southern Conference team. .
Verlin, in my opinion, may be
the greatest source of unex-
posed talent on the team.
There is no one mentally
tougher than he is, he jumps
well, and looks fairly quick.
~ So you ask will this team be
tougher than last year’s? All I
can say is—Terry who?
