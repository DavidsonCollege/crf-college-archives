CRAP Report Importance
Not Rule Change--Carroll

By ALLEN LEWIS
Staff Writer

The proposed change in the
drinking rule and ‘the open
dorm section of the Commit-
tee on Rules and Punish
ment (CRAP) Code of Re-
sponsibility are the least
important parts of the re-
port, according to Mike Car-
roll, CRAP chairman.

Carroll said this week that
the philosophy behind the re
port as stated in the pream-
ble was more important.

CRAP members discussed
the proposed Code at a
sparsely-attended Open End
Wednesday night.

In an opening statement,
Carroll emphasized that the
report printed in last week's
DAVIDSONIAN was merely
a draft. “Negotiations with
the different organizations

‘involved are still in prog

ress,” he said.

Dr. R. D. Kaylor, one of
the two faculty representa-
tives on the committee.
pointed out that the faculty's
Committee on Student Life
must make its recommenda
tions on the CRAP report to
the faculty. Then the report
must be voted on by the fac
ulty and the Board of Trus-
tees before it goes into ef-
fect.

During the discussion that
followed, the committee
members pointed out that Ar
ticle I. Section 10, had al.-
ready been changed. This
section, dealing with open
dorms, had set hours for the
dorms to be open. Under the
revision, Section 10 states
that the Residence Hall As-
sociation is responsible for

setting up hours and proce
dures for open dorms.

In a discussion of the ar-
ticle on the judiciary, the
committee pointed out that
the inclusion of the Honor
Court in the report did not
mean that the faculty would
become involved in the Hon
or System.

YET ONCE MORE

The staffs of the “Q&C” and “The. Mis-
cellany”’ have slways lost the annual cro-
quet match—muanely because they’ve never
showed up. THE DAVIDSONIAN renews
the challenge, for 3 p.m. tomorrow at the
lake campus.

Choice ’68 Gives Students
Voice In Collegiate Survey

By DANNY COLTRANE
Staff Writer

Choice '68, the first national
collegiate. presidential pri-
mary, will be Wednesday at
Davidson. About six million
college students may partici-
pate.

Underwritten by the Time-
Life Corp., Choice °68 was or-
ganized by an 11-man student
board representing all re-
gions of the contry, and will
be conducted simultaneously
on almost 1500 campuses.

Over 70 per cent of those
eligible to vote in the pri-
mary are under 21. Returns
are expected to give a good
indication of how voters be-
tween 21 and 25 will cast
their ballots.

“The psychological effects
of this polling should be tre-
mendous. It may have much
the same effect as one of the
smaller state primaries such
as the New Hampshire Pri-
mary,”". emphasized Tom
Earnhardt, former student
council president.

In addition to presidential
choices, students will be ask-
ed to register their opinions
on major current issues.

Ballots are in computer
punch-card form and will be
rushed back to the Time-Life
data - processing center in
New York City where results
from the participating cam °
puses will be tabulated.

Davidson will receive an
itemized return of how its
students voted. Polls will be
open in the lobby of Cham
bers from first pefiod to 3
p.m. Wednesday.

officer on duty—Little’s sec-
ond fire of this semester.

The fire broke out in ‘a
pile of papers stacked
against the walls,’’ accord-
ing to Frank Fleming, who
was awakened by the smoke
and the crashing of glass as
the security officer went for
the extinguisher.

Although Fleming could
not definitely state whether
or not the fire was intention.
al, he did recall that there
were several fires in trash
cans the night before, and
he was certain these were
intentional.

FE. N. Linker, campus se-
curity officer who was not
on duty but who was called
about the fire, termed it “un-
fortunate.” Referring to the
stack of papers in the hall,
Linker stated that the
fire “‘might have been start.

the possibility of accident
has not been ruled out.

In an interview with the
Greenshoro Daily News
Tuesday, Preyer said that a
report he had been offered
the Davidson job was incor-
rect and added:

“While it's very flattering
to be considered for such a
post as the presidency of
Davidson College. my heart
is set on running for Con.
gress. The challenge I'm
most interested in is repre.
senting all the people of the
sixth district.”

The Daily News also re-
ported that a press release
from Davidson said that a
list of 86 potential candidates
had now been whacked down
to 12, all Presbyterians.

The College News Bureau.
however, said it had no
knowledge of the release.

an, is chairman of David

Awarded
Fellowship

Mike *Carroll has been
awarded a Rockefeller Trial
Year Fellowship for theolog-
ical study, the Fund for The-
ological Education, Inc., has
announced.

Carroll plans to use the
fellowship at the University
of Chicago Divinity Schoo!
next year. The fellowship
covers all thstitutional ex-
penses.

The Rockefeller Fellow-
ships are designed for men
who would not ordinarily
have gone to seminary and
who agree in that year to
consider the ministry as a
vocation.

Carroll, a history major,
is chairman of the Commit-
tee on Rules and Punish-
ments, a member of Phi Be.

Alpha Phi Omega. honorary
service fraternity, Sigma
Delta Pi, Spanish honorary,

“Il definitely haven't been
offered the (Davidson) job.”
Preyer told the Daily News.
“I was sounded out about
allowing my name to be sub
mitted to the selection com.
mittee—along with about a
hundred others.

“But I told the people who
asked me about it that !
was definitely committed to
making this race for Con.
gress."

ident, made an unsuccessful
bid for the N. C. guberna.

Progress on the Negro Scholarship
Fund has been slow, due mainly to in-
action by many of those collecting
and to opposition to the idea, accord-
ing to Rick Harrell, acting treasurer
of the students organizing the drive.
_ “There is actually more opposition
than I had anticipated—more of an
anti-Negro element,” Harrell said.

Harrell said he did not really know
how much money had. been collected
so far, because many of those involved
in the collection had not reported.
and others planned to see students
after Spring Frolics.

He expressed disappointment at
some of the response, in particular
that of students opposing the dirve.
“It’s really bad ... Maybe it’s better
if Negroes don't come if things are
going to be like this.”

At the same time, however, he ex-
pressed confidence that there was
enough support within the student
body to put the fund over $2400.

Former DAVIDSONIAN editor Sam
Boyte had denounced the drive in a

a (Negro) student to come in for a
year to be unhappy because of David-
son’s homoginized whiteness,” but
then apparently reversed himself Mon-
day in assembly by appearing on the
stage with other supporters of the
drive.

Boyte said Thursday night. however,
that his apparent support Monday was
due to a misrepresentation of the pro-
gram. “I do not favor the Negro schol-
arships,” he said.

The drive began with collections
Tuesday and Wednesday after an ex-
planatory student body assembly Mon-
day morning.

It resulted from an offer by psycho-
logy professor W. G. Workman to put
up $100 for a scholarship for a Negro
student if students would match it
with $2400.

Workman’s reaction came as a re-
action to an editorial in the March 21
issue of THE DAVIDSONIAN, which
charged the college administration
with an admissions and recruitment
policy ‘short of tokenism.”

Honor Court Plans Stress
On Increased Awareness

First of Two Articles
By CHARLES McEWEN
Associate Editor

Honor Court Chairman Bill Williams has some
new ideas.

Ideas for intangible things, like an increased
awareness of the honor system among students and
faculty, for instance.

And practical ideas, like publishing a booklet about
the honor system, and sending out questionnaires.

Williams, whom the court elected as chairman
recently, stresses the positive aspects of the honor
system. “It’s not a police system,’ he said. “It would
not be successful as a completely negative system.”

The Honor Court is aiming its orientation program
at faculty members and upperclassmen, but particular-
ly at incoming freshmen.

Tom Baker, vice chairman of the court, is plan-
ning the publication of a booklet which will explain
the honor system here and will clarify certain points.

Baker said that the booklet will stress a spirit of
honor, and will also include the philosophy and history
of the system, will define court procedures and will list
court members.

He explained that there are some student prac-
tices, “diving reviews, for instance,” which clearly
violate the spirit of honor without directly violating the
honor system.

Williams and Baker agreed that it is impossible
to enforce a spirit of honor—it must be created among
students themselves.

The Honor. Court is in, the process of conducting
its annual evaluation of the honor system. Each student
and faculty member is being asked to fill out a ques-
tionnaire. .

Students are being asked for their impressions on
the effectiveness of the honor system and for any rec-
ommendations they might have.

THE DAVIDSONIAN had planned to run the re-
sults of its own student poll on the honor system this
week but has postponed that report until next week,

due to the Honor Court questionnaire.

Faculty members are being asked for their evalua-
tions of the system. Professors who teach laboratory
courses are being asked to define the requirements
for honor in their students’ lab work.

He reiterated his emphasis on faculty and student
orientation in relation to the honor system and on in-
creased communication between the Honor Court and
faculty and students.

For instance, some professors seem to be ignorant
of the faculty rule, passed in 1961 at the request of
the court, that prohibits a professor's giving the same
test to non-consecutive course sections (ROTC was ex-
cepted from this rule).

Williams said that problems like this must be
worked out—by orientation of new faculty members
and students and by an increased awareness of the
honor system for present faculty members and stu-
dents. “Ignorance of the system would really be a
waste,” Williams said.

Next week: How effectively is the honor system
working?
