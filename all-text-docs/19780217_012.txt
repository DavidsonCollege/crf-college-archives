Cats smothered by Deacons

By BRYAN KELLEHER

Staff Writers

Going into Wednesday
night’s game at Wake Forest,
the Davidson Wildcats were
hoping to catch the Deacons on
an off night while having a hot
night themselves. Unfortunate-
ly the exact opposite occured.

Led by All-American candi-
date Rod Griffin’s 26 points,
many on acrobatic dunks, the
Deacs smothered the Wildcats
in a convincing 115-82 victory.
The Cats started out cold from
the beginning, and were bo-
thered by a tight Wake Forest
press.

Davidson shot a poor 35
percent compared to Wake’s 56
percent and found themselves
trailing 50-33 at the halftime
mark. In the second half, the
Cats tried their best to over-
come the deficit, but the story
of the first half repeated itself.

Cd
The Cats’ poor shooting ef-
fort continued as did defensive
lapses that led to easy Wake

baskets. The Deacs coasted on
in for their first win in their past
four games, raising their record
to 15-8.

A key to the game was a poor
shooting performance by Wild-
cat star John Gerdy, who was
held by Wake’s sticky defense
to only 16 points. Freshman
Rich DiBenedetto was the Cats’
only consistent threat for the
night, scoring 19 points and
grabbing 11 rebounds in a
strong inside performance.

According to Coach John
Kochan, senior captain Brian
Coffey also made a fine contri-
bution in the second half.

Though Davidson did not
play well, Wake Forest must be
given full credit for a strong
performance, which included a
new school record of 30 assists.
Kochan commented, ‘‘take
nothing away from Wake—they
played a great game—but I

don’t feel we were representa- .

tive of our ability tonight.”’
The defeat follow a 104-88

Discord severs Mothership

By BAD BERNARD
and HOGMAN
Staff Writers

Bernie and H-Man are a little |

concerned about the secular
nature of The Davidsonian on a
‘campus that is supposed to
have a firm religious founda-
tion.

In light of that concern, (and
with the religious instruction we
received from Christianity and
Art) we have decided to specu-
late an what we would do if we

Gehuld be God for one day at
‘wavidson.

We would make a set of buns
for Mike Knowles to wear with
his pants.

We would give Duke Dorm
stalls with doors to put around
the toilets.

We'd make Al McGuire write
our athletic department beg-
ging it to hire him as head
coach.

We'd bring Billy Carter to

campus as a Reynolds Lecturer. .-

We'd throw a disco and not
dlay “Brick House’’
We'd make Joe Craig wear
his hair messed up for one day.

We'd develop an ordered
clothes washing system for the
laundry so that people like
Steve Sellers don’t wind up with
Pat Hickert’s pants.

We'd ask Kate Jackson and
Jacklyn Smith out for Spring
Frolics. We feel that these are
but a few of the improvements
which we could bring to this
campus that would be in keep-
ing with the spirit of the
Christian commitment of the
school.

The A, B and Women’s
League Tourndments began
this Sunday and so far there
have been just as many winners
as losers.

The big story in A League is
that the pre-Tourney: favorite,
Mothership Connection, is be-
ing ripped by dissension. It
seems that the trouble stems
from a personality conflict be-
tween Rob ‘‘So What If I Date a
Queenie’ Murray and his room-
mate Bill Sherwood.

Sherwood thinks Murray
shoots too much and Murray
can’t stand any of Sherwood's
paintings.

At any rate, it is known that
the conflict has become so
heated that both players have
been sleeping in separate beds
at Oak Hill Apartments.

Teammate Bob Lapple be-
came so disenchanted with the
whole argument that he quit the
team, saying that he was going
to try to take up a new sport
like baseball. Meanwhile, the
'Ship plays just well enough to
win and has advanced to the
semi’s by way of a close 62-44
win over Sweet Ebony.

In other A League action,
Tex’s KA’s surprised a Goodell
and Brownless SAE team 37-30
behind Skip Barkley’s 12
points. The KA’s playing with a
little inspiration from L.O.,
advance to the semi’s in the
tourney by beating Hurtin’ for
Certain 52-43 behind Locke
White’s 19 points. The im-
proved play of big man Schaefer
could take this team to the
finals.

Home Sown Hand Grown has
got its act together as they
steamrolled the Nads 55-44.
Dave Jones’ 14 points paved the
way for HSHG, a team that will
give Mothership all they can
handle.

In B League, the Cush
Hounds have emerged as the
team to beat with a 36-33 win
over the Ragmen. Bell and
Barnhill give the Hounds a run
and gun offense which is going
to be hard to stop.

The Cush Hounds are in that
position because of some upsets
of pre-tourney favorites. The
Gashouse Gang, behind Billy
Hutchings 11 points stunned
Big Daddy Conoscos and Fam-
ily 38-37,

Earlier, Bone knocked off the
Elephants of Squatty Body
27-26 as Perz poured in 15.

The Black Leather Wombats
moved into the semi’s against
the C. Hounds by crushing
Reign of Terror 56-48 (with
Frank ‘‘Disco King’’ Calcott
scoring 18) and then eliminating
First Watts 49-33 behind Stuart
Jordan's 13.

In the other B League game, —
the Kiwis nipped Bone 23-21
with Haynes and Holliday get-
ting 6 each.

In Women’s action, Ruskeller
and Twice as Nice are odds on
favorites to win.

In conclusion, we'd like to
congratulate our|Players of the
Week, the Three Basketeers—
