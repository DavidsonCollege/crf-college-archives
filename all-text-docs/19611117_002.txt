Who's Out Of Step?

Student and trustee action on the
problem of ‘college integration occu-
pied the headlines of campus news-
papers at Wake Forest and Emory
University this week. The situation in
both instances brought to mind our
own; their success and speed only
served to remind us of our lack of
progress.

In Winston-Salem, where the
student body has been supporting a
student from Nigeria all vear. the plea
went out again to the Baptist State
Convention meeting this week for
complete integration of the under-
graduate school. There, the students
are very much a part of the effort to
integrate that church related campus

completely. Trustees have already
lowered the racial barrier ta graduate

private schools only when they oper-
ate on a segregated basis. Despite this,
and encouraged by trustee statements,
students and faculty are pressing for
the next logical step—defying the un-
just state laws even at the risk of
financal loss to fulfill what they feel
is an essential step for a church-re-
lated college of high standards.

There are those at Davidson who
also feel essential stevs must be taken
on the integration issue. Last Feb-
tuary, we were heartened by trustee
approval of admitting Congolese. Un-
fortunately, we have no Congolese
student this vear. and the administra-
tion reports it is unlikely we will find
an acceptable student in time for
registration. next fall.

Thus we lag behind our sister
institutions to the north and south—
both in advances in eliminating racial
segregation and prejudice and in
campis discussion -and action. The

’ Free Press Ne Give Thanks

THE DAVIDSONIAN fecls. that -
dt. appropriate to commeni here on
the recent suppression of a student
columnist at Randolph-Macon College
(see article on this page) both from a
mora! responsibility to stipport a fel-
Jow journalist and because the case
is so happily inapplicable to the Dav-
idson scene.

Phil Whitacre was suppressed
and punished for commenting on what
seems to be a universal collegiate
problem. the cafeteria food. The ad-
ministration’s subsequent action
seems to indicate a true need for re-
form. The columnist made a number
of good suggestions and one rather
rash one.

The reaction of the adr.nistra-
tion, however. is much more shock-
ing than Whitacre’s comments. Not
only was this muzzling of the press
uncalled for under the circumstances,
but it violates the ideals of both demo-
cracy and education.

Just as a free press is necessary
to a free nation, free expression of
student opinion is esential to a real
liberal education. Education is not
brain-washing; it should be a free
search for the good and true—a free
search by both the faculty and stud-
ents. If the Randolph-Macon adminis-
tration silences the press on account
of a dining hall gripe, what would
they say to an editorial attacking seg-
regation, the administration, the
trustees, or any issue which did not fit

the adminislration’s puhlic-rélations
image?

_ Of course, freedom implies. re-
sponsibility—the critic should be -re-
sponsible in both the object and meth:
od-of his criticism: And. freedotn
should be worth fighting for. We are
puzzled that ‘he Yellow Jacket's
editor has made no effort to defend
his columnist and the freedoms to
which he as a newspaperman should
‘be devoted.

Phil Whitacre’s case reminds us
that a college aaministration has ex-
traordinary powers over its students,
and that some administrations are not
unaccustomed to misusing these
powers in a most immoral way, chain-
ing necessary liberties and. smothering
truth wantonly.

Phil Whitacre’s case also reminds
us that this is not the case at David-
son. We are happy that at the recent
Collegiate Press Convention in Miami,
Davidson became known as “that
liberal college.” Fellow delegates
were amazed at Davidson's long tradi-
tion of freedom of the press and free
expression of student opinion.

_ _ We are all most fortunate in hav-
ing a President, who as a former
DAVIDSONIAN Editor, realizes fully
the necessity of freedom of the press
and an administration and faculty
which, although not always agreeing
with our opinions, have always de-
fended our right to express these
opinions.

The Vagabonds And Their Patrons

The Vagabonds scored favorably
last week with their production of
Anouilh’s “Antigone.” Attendance was
especially good for the three perform-
ances, with eight people even watch-
ing the play from the light booth
Friday night when seating space was
unavailable.

Those eight were students from
Lees-McRae College who made the
trip just for this performance. It was
particularly gratifying to the cast and
stage crew that someone was that in-
terested, even to the point of standing
throughout the performance.

Response was favorable from other
nearby colleges, too. Students from
Charlotte College, Queens and others
made the trip to Hodson Hall. Over
200 students from other colleges at-
tended during the three nights, some

from more than 100 miles away.

Unfortunately, this surpassed the
number of Davidson students present,
who had a choice of three nights and a
distance of only a few hundred yards
at most. Some 198 Davidson gentle-
men made it.

The performances were good, and
the attendance was good. But then
look at the people attending.

We congratulate the Vagabonds
on their success. We look forward with
great anticipation for a restaging of
the Wakefield Master’s “Second
Shepherd's Play” between Thanks-
giving and Christmas.

That play was one of the group’s
first and best received successes. It is
a play well worth becoming a David-
son holiday season tradition. Could we
make that request, Vagabonds?

Court Sees Gambling Rule
As ‘Reasonable Restraint’

BY HARRISON WELLFORD
Honor Court Chairman

In light of President Martin's
comment in chapel last week
concerning the Executive Com-
mittee’s recent internretatian of
the gambling rule in the Stud-
ent Body Regulations. the Honor
Court would like at this time to
make its position clear on this
matter.

The Executive Committee’s
statement is as follows:

“Gambling is defined as an
organized game of skill or
chance, the main purpose of
which is the accumulation of
money and in which more than
two people are involved.”

Although the Honor Court has
operated in the nast in essential
agreement with this interpreta-
tion of gambling, it feels that
some elaboration oi this defini-
tion would be beneficial.

ORGANIZED GAMBLING

The Honor Court is concerned
particularly with gambling that
has been organized over a sig:
nificent period of time and in
which the motive of the partici-
pants has been to gain a definite
monetary reward rather than to
enjoy the sport. of a game of
chance.

This interpretation would ap-
ply in particular to any gamb-
ling organized by influences out-
side the college, although the
actual incidence of gambling
must take place on the David-
son campus.

The above interpretations are
presented with the realization
that they do not encompass
specifically. all cases that might
arise under the. gambling rule.

BEYOND ABILITY

It is perhaps beyond the
ability of any rule to delineate
the nature of every instance of
gambling that might be consid-
ered ungentlemanly conduct.

The Court feels that the pur-
pose of the gambling rule in the
Student Body Regulations is
mainly to exercise a. reasonable
restraint in the area of gamb-
ling..

The Honor Court will endeav-

or to judge each case on its own
merits taking into.consideration
all circumstances involved, and
then to render a decision in
keeping with the spirit of the
rule and in the best moral in-
terest of those students con-
cerned.

Observer Lauds Spirit
Of Wake’s Persistence

(From The Charlotte Observer)

The younger generation is
usually several stens in front of
the adults in willingness to
«nock down artificial barriers
based on race.

Back. when a mob was raging
outside a dormitory at the Uni-
versity of Georgia. demanding
the expulsion of Negro student
Charmayne Hunter, white coeds
were in her room making her
welcome.

And, at. Wake Forest College,
a group of students persists in
extending a helping hand to a
youth from Ghana in an effort to
break the college’s color bars.

The Wake Forest students’
support of 19-year-old Edward
Reynolds is regarded by many
adults as unrealistic idealism or
youthful irresponsibility. But
we would wager that their feel-
ings and actions eventually will
be a strong factor in admission
of Negroes to the undergrad-
uate school.

The student leaders have
shown determination and_in-
genuity in raising funds to get

They won’t be satisfied. how-
ever, until the trustees of their
college admit Reynolds or some
other scholastically qualified
Negro student to the Baptist
school.

In fairness to the trustees. it
should be said that they have
approved admission of Negro
students to graduate schools
and as special students in eve-
ning classes and summer ses-
sions. But they have been reluc-
tant to accept undergraduates
until. the denominational pulse
stops racing.

The students, answering only
to their own convictions in the
matter, have contributed to
‘policy changes already made.
They have done so at personal
sacrifice of. time, energy and
money.

We're betting their youthful
idealism will before long be
fully rewarded, for theirs is an
idea whose time has elearly

Student Eats Words
At Randolph-Macon

BY DON SAUNDERS
Davidsonian Associate Editor

The student voice of Randolph-Macon Men’s Col-
lege, Ashland, Virginia, is nervously quiet these days.
The Yellow Jacket had found itself the center of con-
troversy in an apparently long-standing feud between
students and the cafeteria food service.

Then, in a quick move fast month, the college ad-
ministration took action against Phil Whitacre, a column.

ist on the paper.

In a column on Sept. 29, Whitacre wrote on the evils
of a cafeteria in which all students must take their meals.
He had a number of gripes: the building was designed
before a large increase in enrollment, and is too small for
the number of students fed; service had become sloppy;
and students felt prices of “extras” were too high.

In his article, Whitacre made a number of construc.
tive suggestions which were later followed. He also said:

“t would hate to suggest a food strike such as was
so successfully carried out at High Point College a few
years ago with very favorable results. But | am not so
sure | would not oppose the idea if such were needed.
Right now | am convinced that it is not necessary.”

It was to this paragraph that college officials took
offense. In surprise action, the writer was charged with
technically inciting.a riot, and hailed into the president's
office.

Administration officials objected to mentioning High
Point’ College ‘in othér than praise or announcement,’ ...
Because Whitaere is over 21, he could have heen.threaten:
ed with legal action.

After a closed conference with fhe prasicdent and the
dean of students, it was decreed that Whitacre would ro-
sign from his post as columnist on The Yellow Jacket.
Although no lega! action was taken against Whitacre, he
was refunded his beard money and is now refused service
in tne cafeteria.

Students Pay, Appeal

BY GREG GOVAN
Davidsonian Staff Writer

In obedience to the command of John Kuykendall.
the students went forward to pay their fines to Mrs.
Fleagte or stepped to the back of the room to tell their
“gripes.” Traffic court was in session in 126 Chambers.

THE DAVIDSONIAN later interviewed Richard C.
Burts, dean of students about the new court. Asked for a
general comment, Burts stated that he was “quite pleased
with the operation.” And while there was no definite
evidence to back it up, there seemed to be a decrease in
the number of violations.

“The men are just plain co-operating,” Burts com-
mented, and added that the problem of traffic was no
longer being paid just lip-service. Despite the fact that
the watch on traffic has been doubled with the addition
of Security Officer Smith, the number of violations has
decreased because the students are at last becoming
aware that traffic is something of importance.

DOLLAR FINE

Burts explained that the fine for a violation was one
dollar. While the fines do not increase with a repetition
of offenses, there is an “accumulative effect.” A great
accumulation of offenses may prompt the court to re-
strict the car of a multiple offender.

Why was the court organized? Burts stated that he
had worked with a similar organization before, and its
necessity was illustrated here because of the burden on
Mrs. Fleagle of collecting the fines piecemeal.

“But more important,” he added, “there existed an
unsatisfactory situation as regards students’ extenuating
circumstances.” The appeal system was not meeting the
needs.

TWENTY CASES

Now, every week the court hears about 20 cases, of
whom between five and ten will probably appeal their
tickets. “We usually split up the middle on letting the
appeals stand,” said Burts. “This should show the stud-

ents that we know how to say ‘yes’ also,’ he added with

a smile.

In addition to the Dean of Students (or Mr. Kuyken-
dall, in his absence) and whomever may be needed to
handle extra loads, there is present a Student Council
observer. His purpose is to be an impartial observer and
evaluator of the court’s activities. —

“Of course, it is really too early to make any definite.
observations. We really haven't had a chance to seriously
evaluate the court,” Burts remarked.

ENTIRE TRAFFIC PROGRAM

As a special emphasis, Burts pointed out that
it was a mistake to think of the court as merely a parking
ticket program. In reality, though the majority of its
cases involve parking, the court is part of the entire traf-
fic program, and is set up to handle registration, speed-
ing, and other violations, though the last two have not
been encountered as of yet.

By way of evaluation, Burts summed up the court
as being very successful, both from the standpoint of
making the students more traffic conscious and creating
better student relations by a streamlining of the appeals
process.

Back in room 126 on Fridays, the students are apt
to agree to the first point, and three or four are sure to
heartily endorse the second.
