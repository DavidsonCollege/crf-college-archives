Creek on Local Court

Listless Game Won by Freshmen by
a 45 to 30 Count—Scrubs Play

In a rather exciting contest here Sat-
Rawson's fighting
quintette emerged on the big end of a
45-30 count with the strong Long Creek
team. The score at the aA of the first
half stood at 26-21 in favor of the locals.
At times the team work of both aggre-
gations approached a high point of bril-
lancy, only to grow dim again in a ses-
sion of slow play. The game was hotly
contested but was marred by the incon-
sistent and rather ragged playing of
both teams.

The: Wildkittens have room for im-
provement, and will have to take on
more and form to successfully
compete with the other Freshman teams
of this section.

Coach Rawson has developed a fairly
strong offensive quint but his’ defensive
must “be bolstered.

speed

The Long Creek lads, recently con-
quered by &'Tex’s Cowboys,” put up
a scrappy fight, but the offense of the
Freshmen was too great for them. They

couldn't overcome the lead piled up
against them.
At the end of the first quarter the

whole second team was substituted and
made a very good showing. During their
stay of ten minutes in the contest, the
scrubs increased the lead from four to
five points.

Coach TeX Tilson worked out a nice
job in the role of referee.

The Davidson line-up was as follows:

McColgan, R. T.

Milner, L. T.

Wilson, C.

Brown, R, G.

Harrison, L. G.

Substitutes: Hall, Mauldin,
Lipton, and McAuley. Ne

Who Knows?

That at the opening of the colleg in 1915
a golf club was organized and every stu-
dent wishing to become a member had
to pay $5.00,
a tournament. It was decided that a two
ball foursome tournament would be held.
The players were to pair off in teams of
two, two men playing with the same ball,
The object of this tournament was to
create a team spirit, which was to re-
sult in a Davidson College Golf Team.

Plans were drawn up for

That Davidson had a gymnasium team
that made a trip to Kings Mountain, and
put on an exhibition at the celebration
held on the anniversary of the battle of
Kings Mountain in 1915.

That the drinking fountain was pre-
sented to the college by the class of
1916, with their class number glazed up-
on it. Prior to the erection of this foun-

tain the old “College Well” held domin- |

ion in that immediate vicinity.

That Greek wasalso a “jonah” for
Woodrow Wilson. His grade for the
spring term, as shown by the records in
the library, was 88 as compared to 92,
his next lowest grade.

That Dr. Martin, accompanied by a
Charlotte delegation, called upon Vice-
President Marshall and invited him to
deliver an address at the celebration of
the one hundred and thirty-ninth anni-
sary of the.signing of the Mecklenburg
Declaration of Independence on May 20,
1914. Each member of the party extend-
ed a personal invitation to Mrs. Marsha!1
for it was only through their combined
efforts that he finally agreed to parti-
cipate in the celebration.

That there appeared an editorial in
the December issue of The Davidsonian
in 1915 to this effect: “We wish to
thank the faculty for extending our
Christmas holidays to the fifth of Jan-
uary. We have a faculty unexcelled in
its consideration of the students’ wants
and desires. ‘It lends its heartiest sup-
port to every worthy college activity.
Let us stand behind our faculty then, as
it has. always stood behind us.”

That in 1924, ten years fater, an article
to this effect: “And they cram two holi-
days into one, and make us attend chapel
half of that one. We call it the height
of “Ikieology!”
