Down With The Stink!
Cry Gingko Abolitionists ee,

BY GREG GOVAN

Davidsonian Feature Writer

Gingko biloba, female, relic of the last coal age, stood serenely in front of the
west wing of Belk Dormitory. completely oblivious to the small sign on its trunk. The
sign read. “Down with the stink!’ and urged students to sign a petition to have the
female gingko trees removed.

Student opinion was running
high against the two offenders.
the second one situated behind
Little Dormitory. Within two
days there were over 250 names
on the petition.

It was obvious that the student

body wanted something done a-

class could start a new tradition

Johnston: Study Abroad
Naturally Complicated

AVIEE KIRBY

Davidsonian Associate Editor

“Tt is onlv nafural that a student who studies abroad will run inta manv compli- |
cations.” Dean Frontis W Johnston pointed out in an interview with THE DAVID-

SONIAN this week.

“The student must.know what
jhe wants and be prepared to
, take the risks involved in get-
| ting it. But the initative should

always be with the student.”

Asked about a suggestion by
_ six students who spent their
| junior years abroad, that David-

to handle the problems of for-
eign study, Johnston pointed out
that the faculty had’ appointed
Prof. Bradley D. Thompson to
that position last year.

“The matter of evaluation of
credits remains in the hands of
the Curriculurn Committee,
which. usually designates that
power to me, and 1 consult Prof.
Thompson.

“Last year Davidson affiliated
with the Junior Year Abroad
Program of Vanderbilt in Aix-
en-Province, France.”

As for advising the student,
“We can’t be expected to know
about every. university system.
We have boys come in here who
want to go to Ghana, India, and
practically everywhere,” John-!
ston pointed out.

“We will do everything we
can to facilitate a boy who wants
to go abroad, but we must pro-
tect the interests of the colfege.
We reserve the right to accept

“The only practical solution
to the whole problem is in the
affiliation with other universi-
ties in sending students abroad. ‘

“The problem of transferal of '
credit is a great one. There are
often no real criteria for trans-

Mascot Gets Name

Spartanburg and Columbia,

announced that Davidson had a.

“monster cat on campus and was

starving him so that he weuld
not sleep through football games

The reports that we are starv-

college in ill-repute with the

from a woman out west berating
the school and announcing that
she is sending a report to the

are starving our mascot to keep
him ferocious. Our case may
turn into one similar to Iredell

Within the relatively odor-proof. air conditioned
walls of Dana Science Hall, Biology Professor William T.
Lammars spoke enthusiastically of the virtues of Gingko

Biies3. mals

“it hes a pretty shape; or
shou'd have when lefi alone to
grow... satd De. Lammars.; “In
the fall the leaves turn a bril-
liant yellow overnight, and then
-drop-overnight. so you only have
‘ta rake your yard once.” In ad-
dition’ the gingko is a hardy
tree with no known diseases and
an ability to thrive .in space
that would be fatal to most
other trees.

The gingxo has a.-fase:nating
hisiory. Evolutionary, it lies be-
tween the conifers and flower-
ing trees, It probably would not
have survived-from the last coal
ade except for the fact that the
Chinese held it to be semi-
sacred. Before its introduction
to the United States. the gingko
was found only in Chinese
temple yards. Indeed, the tree
does not exist except in a domes-
tic state.

“Because of its hardihood, the
gingko is in great demand a-
mong city beautifiers,” Dr. Lam.
mars continued. Sut whoever

“really blundered.” “In. many
states it is illegal to sell female
gingzo trees. The females are
nothirg but a nuisance,” he said,
refusing to extena this comment
beyond the plant kingdom.

Pulpwood is the only com-
mercia! use. but the’ male is,
“highly recommended” for dec-
orative purposes. As for the!
berry-burfing females. they
“ought to be cut down” and re-
placed with the non-offensive
males. “There is no need for.
the females on this campus,
none whatever. And they cer-
tainly should not be near any
beaten path.”

As an impetus to any gingko-
philes. Dr. Lammars ventured to
taste one of the berries. “It is
sharp and tangy, with the taste
and consistency of lindberger
cheese.” he reflected. But it
would appear that even the
biology department would rath-
er have free passage on side-
walks and pure atmesphere than
a highly improbable new source
of cpicurean delight.
