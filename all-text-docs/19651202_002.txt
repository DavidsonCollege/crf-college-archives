With Mixed Emotions

Davidson freshmen are entering the
final stages of this year's notoriously
drawn-out and dangerously com-
promised system of rush with mixed
emotions of gleeful anticipation and
shattered hopes.

Already evaluations are coming
from all sides of the fraternity ques-
tion concerning the advantages of
this complicated system which few
people can really comprehend.

One consensus of opinion which is
fairly certain is that one year of such
a preposterous plan of isolation of the
freshman class is enough for all con-
cerned.

Improvement in classroom morale
has been noted by many professors.
Other observers have pointed out a
greater class unity and much more
elan among all freshmen.

The most noteworthy aspect of the
system so far is the ability to look at
the student for what he is individually,
instead of through a facade of pledge
pins, sweat shirts and “clothes like
the brothers are wearing.”

But along with the improvements
which delayed rush has brought have
been the needless complications in-
herent in the plan which the faculty
fraternity committee stubbornly ‘ten-
dered as the only possible solution be-
tween the wishes of the faculty and
the Trustees.

Like many others we eagerly await

the report of the continuing study by
the Social Life Evaluation Committee.
We are certain that the committee
members have reflected back on the
report of the Fraternity Evaluation
Committee last spring, and we urge
other students to re-examine that re-
port in light of the confused system
which fraternity men and freshmen
alike have endured so far.

It would be presumptuous to make
any recommendations before the com-
pletion of this year’s rush, but we are
certain that definite adjustments will
be proposed in the new evaluation
committee’s report which is due to
be presented to the faculty in Feb-

ruary.

THE DAVIDSONIAN continues to
maintain wholehearted endorsement
of the nine immediate recommen-
dations of the Fraternity Evaluation

Committee as the most reasonable and.

practical beginning to a solution of
the fraternity problem. co

These recommendations, which in
no way call for the abolition of fra-
ternities on the Davidson campus,
were supported by 11 of the 12 mem-
bers of the Fraternity Evaluation
Committee and basically called for a
moratorium on rush for this year.

Too many times jessons are learned
the hard way. ;

The inevitably bitter end of this
year’s confusion cannot come too
soon.

Sojourn Of The Bircher

The sojourn on campus this week

of John Rousselot, national director .

of public relations for the John Birch
Society, was an articulate exposition
of right-wing ideology which is rarely
seen at Davidson.

Rousselot’s stay on campus—all of
four hours long—was hardly enough
time to satisfy any well-meaning critic
of the JBS. but it was a welcomed
departure from the lamentable con-
servative spokesmen. we sometimes
ace.

Drawing the largest number of lis-
teners this year to the after-chapel
coffee hour, the Bircher politely—
though not always completely—an-
swered even the most poisoned ques-
tions.

So the campus which hosted a Com-
munist and an atheist two years ago
has seen the other extreme slip in
and out with hardly anything to re-
semble the fanfare and repercussions
of the visitors two years ago.

Keep On Fighting, Men

Amidst the verbal barrages being
leveled at Davidson’s ROTC program,
we would like to commend the mili-
tary science department for some re-
cent changes which were made fol-
lowing a student opinion survey of last
spring.

As reported in this week’s DAVID-
SONIAN, many of the changes in-
volved adjustments in the Tuesday
afternoon drill schedule.

Other alterations in classroom in-
struction and testing clearly indicate
a positive interest in the basement of
Belk dormitory towards strengthening
the ROTC program on campus.

Col. Frederick B. Outlaw and his
staff warrant every recognition for
these long-needed changes that have
finally been effected. Davidson is
fortunate to have such men who are

willing to seriously consider the eval-
uations of students.

However, certain questions remain
to be answered—in words and deeds
—by the college administration as to
the requirement of two years of mili-
tary science for all Davidson students.

The action by the ROTC department
evidences its concern for the better-
ment of its position on campus. But
its compulsory status is still distaste-
ful and remains to be rectified by the
administration — not the ROTC de-
partment.

The obvious success of serious stu-
dent evaluation in this instance should
not be overlooked either. May the
college be willing to accept this lesson
from Army intelligence and apply it
with vigor.

Look, Ma - Cavities

As if we didn’t have enough prob- '

lems, there is always someone like Dr.
Doran D. Zinner who makes life more
complicated.

He is a University of Miami dentist-
microbiologist who says that tooth de-
cay is a very contagious disease and
has little or nothing to do with num-
ber of candy bars you eat or the num-
per of dental cavities your parents

ad.

“For many years we thought of
tooth decay as hereditary,” he said.
“But now we know that if an individ-
ual does not have a certain type of
bacteria in his mouth, he will not get
cavities.”

Zinner and four colleagues have
been studying this abysmal problem
for vears and they have reached the
conclusion that decay bacteria can be
transmitted only by direct contact.

The implications involved here
might not throw the world into tur-
moil, but they certainly have the po-
tential.to affect our way of life. The
fact that hits an exposed nerve is that
the most effective way these bacteria
can be “transmitted by direct con-
tact” is by kissing, but Zinner ad-
mits. “This is not going to stop kiss-
ing.”

We most surely agree and predict
that no disease in history will be
knowingly spread with such pleasure.
In fact, a whole new approach to
identifying boy- girl relationships
could arise from this.

No longer will a girl say, “I have
his pin.”

She will proudly declare, “I have his
cavities.”

Dear Editor:

This is in response to Dr.
Richards, letter, to the Board of
Trustees, and to its latest action.
Davidson claims to be a Christ-
ian Nberal arts college. This is
a condradiction in terms. If
Christianity is to be officially
prescribed and its opposition by
implication prescribed, how can
the liberal arts be fostered?

The liberal arts minus one or
two is not liberal at all. But the
problem is not merely Christ-
ianity, for if the modern Christ-
ian Church were genuinely de-
voted to Christ and what He
said, it would experience the
most radical unheaval since the
Reformation.

The moral and emotional bag-
gage of Christianity in the South
is the real milistone about
Davidson's neck, the force which
when implemented by partial
faculty disenfranchisement will
most certainy drag Davidson
into intellectual obscurity.

What the trustees are saying
in effect is, ‘‘We are so blinded
by our own WASPism that we
cannot permit a young professor
outside our values to teach at
Davidson; or, if we must occa-
sionally tolerate such an individ-
ual, we must stifle his original-
ity and flexibility until he is our
automation.

Davidson's ethnocentrism in
microcosm will be self-perpetu-
ating as long as the barriers for
both student and faculty eccent-
ricity are impermeable. Until we
admit and accept atheists, an-
archists, and other authentic
thinkers, until every point of
view has at least nominal repre-
sentation, Davidson can never
honestly call itself a liberal arts
college.

What is the purpose of a col-
lege but to teach students how
to think? And how can they learn

this unless they know how others
have thought and are now think-
ing? Why should any restriction
be placed on ideas? Because
some ideas are dangerous, it is
said. Who says?

The Board of Trustees, who
are mature and wise men. What
does maturity and wisdom re-
flect but personal experience?
Why should the consensus on
values of 50 or 50 million men
determine for others which ideas
are dangerous? Because some
ideas may be socially dangerous.
How do they know?

As participants in various so-
cial processes they can identify
socially destructive ideas. And
they have a duty to screen these
ideas from impressionable stu-
dents. But what assurance do we
have that those who wish to pre-
serve the existing social order
are less dangerous than those
who wish to modify or reform
it?

What right do 51 men have to
tell 1000 students that they have
a monopoly on truth? Or that
they have discovered some ideas
that are certainly valid and
others that are just as surely
invalid? Why should a minority
impose on a majority its beliefs
without the consent of that ma-
