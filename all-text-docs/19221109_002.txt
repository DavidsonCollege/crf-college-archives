CHONG’S LETTER

Davidson, N. C.
November 6, 1922.

Dear Joe:

The Wildcats were turned back,
15-0 Saturday by the Wolfpack. That
fatal fumble and an intefcepted pass
presented State with two touchdowns
and the game. The Wildcats, even in
defeat, showed flashes of real form.
The biggest thing is that Cap’n Spratt
showed all his old time stuff and
showed that he has gotten over. that

malaria that kept him out of the Wake
Forest game and most of the: V. P. I.
game. Right there at the last of the
State game Spratt opened up and
twisted his way through for gain after
gain. The Wildcats also showed a
brilliant aerial attack that threatened
time after time.

We are looking forward to big
things against Carolina, Joe. Last
year we tied them and the season be-
fore we won and its up to us again this
year. Carolina beat State 14-9 and we
lost to em 15-0, but Carolina will have
a hard time trimming us. Joe, Caro-
lina has played six games and has been
scored upon in every affair except the
Trinity affair. The only defeat handed
‘em was by Yale and they sure played
Yale some game.

ook at our record though, foe. It’s
a lot worse than theirs but can Caro-
lina boast of any greater game than
the Wildcats played against V. P. I.?
Things have been breaking bad for us
Joe, and we haven't always backed our
team like we should. There was some-
thing in The Log of the U.S. Naval
Academy the other day that went
something like this:

“Ht’s easy to-yelltike-a-madman
When the team comes through like a
shot
But it takes all your stuff
When the going is rough
So show all the spirit you’ve got.”

The scrapping Wildcats have got to
win this game. The only way to win
that Carolina game is for 500 wilder
Wildcats to go down to Charlotte see-
ing red! The Wildcats have got to
come across, Joe, and they're going to
do it. What we’re going to do that
game is to make Carolina’s wonder
team wonder ‘what’s happening.

Charlotte and. the alumni are de-
pénding on us to put Davidson where
she belongs. It’s up to the student
body to put this thing across. Some
of the boys can’t realize that pep and
yelling AT the;game isn’t all that
counts. Its the spirit BEFORE the
game. that counts. Before the Tech
game we gave the team a big send-off
but it was what went.before tligtsend-
off as well as the send-off thathelped
the Wildcats to hold Tech.

Last year the Wildcats stopped
Carolina and just watch us this year.
Frock Carolina.

The Charlotte Observer has. in its
headlines after the Trinity game that
the Wildcats claws were clipped. A
wounded animal scraps all the harder
and the Wildcats.are fighting for that
Carolina game. The Wildcats aren’t
willing to sit by and watch Carolina
paint Charlotte red. There isn’t any
alternative— when ‘liar Heels and
Wildcats clash its.down with the Tar
Heels. There isn’t a team in the State
that can beat Davidson when real tra-
ditional Wildcat spirit backs up the
team.

That's the way the Wildcats feel
about it, so it’ll be Davidson Day on
the 18th.

The Soph quint increased its lead in
the race for the class rag last week by
trouncing the Freshmen, 43-5, while
the Seniors were beateny the Juniors,
23-20, and dropped to third place in
the standing. The Sophs have one of
the greatest scoring aggregations ever
seen on the Hill, while their passing
leaves little to be desired. In three
games the Sophs have rung up 109
points to 26 for the opposition or more
than four points for every one made
by their opponents. One game of the
first round remains to be played off,
the Junior-Fresh contest, and six
games follow in the second round. The
schedule for the remaining seven
games is as follows:

November 10—Junior-Fresh.

November 14+—Junior-Senior.

November 17—Soph-Fresh,

Junior-Senior Game

By winning Tuesday night, 23-20,
the Juniors shoved the~- champions
down to third place in the class stand-
ing. It was the Junior’s first victory
of the season and they showed a com-
plete reversal of form from their pre-
vious start. They?jumped into the lead
from the start and led 8-2, The Seniors
then staged a comeback and went to
the front 9-8. The Juniors forged
ahead and at the €nd df the half were
leading 12-11.

The second half was as close and as
hard fought as the first, the Juniors
scoring 11 points and the Seniors 9,
making the final count 23-20. The
game was hard fought from whistle to
whistle, and proved to be the most in-
teresting of the season.

The individual star of the evening
was Frank Toney who dropped six
shots into the basket from the floor
and added four more points fo ‘the
Senior score by shooting fouls, for a
total of 16 points. Elkins, the Junior
forward, also threw six through the
hoop and played.a great floor game.
Seven fouls were called on each side
and Toney converted four into points,
while McBryde made three good.

Fresh-Soph Game

The Sophs beat their high score
record by four points Friday night
and walloped the Freshmen 43-5 as
against the 39-5 licking handed the
Juniors two weeks before. Presenting
an almost impregnable defense, the
Sophs allowed the underclassmen to
shoot but one goal from the floor, and
this, together _with three foul shots,
made up the Freshmen’s meager five
points.

Pete Mitchell tossed in eight of the
21 field goals made by his team from
every angle and carried off high point
honors for the evening. Staley gar-
nered six while Ed Morrison made
three long shots from the middle of the
floor, Anderson and Ted Koenig also
played a great game on the floor. Ted

ERE ICE FSCO REET

BRICE-D

Marion Brice’ has the distinction of
being the only candidate for a Master
of Arts degree at Davidson for the
year 1923. He came to Davidson in
the fall of 1918, from the recesses of
Alabama, from a spot called Marior
Junction. ?

Brice has distinctions other than
those of scholarship, however. — He
showed up well in. football during his
Freshman year. During his sopho-
more year he received an injury to his
knee that made football for that year
impossible, but during his Junior year
Marion was pushing the renowned
Sam Brady for his old time berth at
center until another injury to the same
joint laid him out of the game for the
rest of the season. When the season
of 1921 opened the position of center
was thought to be open but Brice soon
had the position cinched and has had
little quarrel for it since. Although
Brice is comparative light he fills his
position to the satisfaction of the most
fastidious, and few are the gains made
over the center of the Wildcat line.

Brice is one of the few men on the
campus who is able to combine football
with—high standing in his classes.
While his name is not to be found on
the honor roll he is one of the’ best
scholars on the campus. This is readily
proven by the fact that he escaped
from every examination last year. His
specialty seems to be Physics since he
has held the position of assistant on
that subject for two years.

Marion seemed to like the idea of
playing football and not taking any
exams for he returned.to the den of the
Wildcats to get his M. A. this year and
has proven himself to be an invaluable
man in the Wildcat line-up. He has
made .for ‘more than his share of
tackles this year and he has been re-
sponsible for many gains,

T).

Carolina’s victory over Tulane puts
V. M. I..as the leading defensiye team
in Dixie. Only one touchdown has
been made on the Flying Cadets, while
no other team has been able to hold
the opposition to less than two or three
markers. V. M. I. has. made 173
points to their opponents seven.
Lynchburg, Roanoke, N. C. State, Vir-
ginia and Catholic University have all
fallen in turn. In fact it looks like the
Cadets have a team like that of a few
years ago that claimed the national
championship. '

rarely allowed the Freshmen a shot
under the basket.

The score stood 16-0 when Bachman
tossed in a field goal for the Fresh-
men’s first,counter. The Sophs con-
tinued to pile up the score and the half
ended, 28-2. The Sophs were held to
15 points during the final period, while
the Fresh made three points. In the
last few minutes the Soph scrubs went
in and made one field, goal. At this
point the game became a rough and
tumble free-for-all and men were
spilled all over the floor.

DIXIE. DOPE

Carolina continued to show an
irresistible drive combined with a good
defense and won a hard fought game
from Tulane Saturday, 19-12, Before
the game Tulane was unscored on and
unbeaten and the Tar Heel victory
means that a new power'has stepped on
the Southern football stage. To date
Carolina has won six games in the
South, lost only to Yale, and made 152
points to 54 for their opponents.

Wofford doesn’t look particularly
dangerous as an opponent for the
Wildcats, for last week the Terriers
lost to P. C., 32-0. Even if Davidson
plays the sort of game they did against
the Presbyterians they have a margin
of 31 points.

Only four more weeks are left be-
fore football passes on and still there
are six undefeated teams striving for
the championship below the Mason and
Dixon line. Auburn, Vanderbilt,
Centre, North Carolina, V. M. J., and
Ga. Tech will line up about in the
order-named.-Auburn’s-vietory-over
Georgia and hex great offensive power
places her just about equal with Vandy
for the lead of the bunch. _Vanderbilt
by defeating Texas and Tennessee and
tying Michigan is held by many to be
a better team than the Auburn Plains-
men, Centre will have an opportunity
to show her full power and walk off
with the “rag” when she meets Auburn
at Auburn in the next week or so. Ga.
Tech, V. M. I. and Carolina are on a
slightly lower level but all of them
have a chance to come out on top.

W. & L’s upset at the hands of Vir-
ginia sends V, P. I. into third place as
a scoring machine in the South, Ala-
bama’s astounding victory over Penn-
sylvania raises-the stock of the Crim-
son Tide way up yonder but defeats
by Tech and Texas and a tie with
Sewannee knocks all championship
hopes out of reach. The leading offen-
sive teams.are:

Auburn—245, opponents 35; lost 1.

Centre—230, opponents 33 ; lost 1.

V. P. I1—198, opponents 29; lost 1.

W. & L.—183, opponents 47; lost 1.

Alabama—182, opponents 50; lost 1.

All except Auburn and Centre are
practically out of the Southern race.
