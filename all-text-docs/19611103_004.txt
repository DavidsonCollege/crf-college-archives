Martin's Secret Avocation

“It's sort of an unusual avocation,” admitted President D. Grier Martin of David-
son College. wnen questioned about his private sport of “frisbee throwing.”

The questioning centered a-
round President Martin's off-
hours preoccupation with 4
flying-saucer-like plastic disk
known as:a “frisbee.” Gnawing
curiosity about the manifesta-
tions of violent activity in the
Martins’ back yard led first to
furtive spying through hedges,
and finally, to an open interview
with the president.

“Last spring,” seid Dr. Mar-
tin, “some of the boys developed
an interest in frisbee throwing.
They would play between Cham-
bers and my house, and { used
to stop and watch them on my
way home.”

Dr. Martin was asked if he
would like to learn the art. of
frisbee throwing. He said he was

willing, and asked that Joe
Robinson come over and give
him a few lessons.

“Joe was the champ of them
all.” he says. “He could throw
it a mile.”

“A few days later, I was
maneuvered into a game of
throwing it.” However, he was
greatly embarrassed because he
couldn't sail it straight or catch
it. “But one of the boys lent me
one to practice with,” he says.
and he promptly got involved in
another game.

"This time,” he says, “I was

about the same job as a man,
but they generally aren’t as
efficient.” .

The students seemed almost
to forget Miss Universe as they
tackled their first German
breakfast in months: “Wurst.
real wurst, it's delicious . .. and
cheese, I suppose I miss Swiss
cheese more than anything.”

Fraeulein Schmidt, who
speaks only German and Russian
and no English. went on to com-
ment about the language bar-

‘rier. “The first time I made a
T.V. commercial, I was supposed
to pour some Royal Crown Cola
into a glass and say, ‘Royal
Crown!’ I learned the lines care-
fully, but when I poured, I
made a mistake and said, ‘Coca-
Cola! Delicious'!”

“Actually, | like Coke best of
all anyway,” she commented.

From her interpreter came.a
friendly warning. “Ssh, Marlene.
the enemy may be listening!”

An old German man had push-
ed his way to her side for a pic-
ture. “If you're ever in Char-
lotte again and want to speak
German, just call on me. Heh,
heh.”

A well-furred and obviously
thick-skinned Charlotte lady
rushed breathlessly up to one of
the Davidson boys. “You don't
mind taking my husband's pic-
ture with your camera, do you?
1 want a’ picture of him with
Miss Universe.” Two couks had

now left the buffet table and
were taking home movies.
“Everybody who wants to go
to church with Miss Universe,
raise his hand please. Okay, re-

port to the cars at the front of

the hotel.” The Miss Universe

group, including the Davidson. |

ians, were greeted at St. Mark’s
Lutheran Church by the rector,
who made a long welcoming
speech to a still smiling,
but uncomprehending Marlene
Schmidt. He ended with a bit of
graduate reading exam German,
“Verstehen Sie?”

Heads turned as the group
marched to the front. of the
church sanctuary. The rector
rose, began the service in the
name of the Father, the Son and

the Holy Ghost. and announced | they've gone out of stock.” “These records will be kept to}
that the congregation was host! says Dr. Martin. In this case, the help the students, not to get at |

woman in the world. “Our wives; Martin his could make a killing pose, only a desire to help the!

beautiful to us, of course. And
remember.” he went on. “beauty
has always been associated with
holiness: I Chronicles 16:29.
‘ ... worship the Lord in the
beauty of holiness.” We are
happy to welcome Miss Universe
of 1961!"

“You'd never see that in a
German church,” commented
one of the exchange students.

The group left Marlene

Schmidt at the reception fol-
lowing the service to return to
Davidson. “She’s a nice girl,
just a real nice girl.”

MORE SPACE NEEDED

The present library building.
Davidson said, will “pack" this
number of books, bet more
space will be needed to facili-
tate the handling and shelving
of books.

Except for this need for more
stack space about 12 years from
now, Dr. Davidson said that the
present building is adequate.
He added, however, that the re-
sérve reading room should be
enlarged, possibly into the up-
per floor of the new wing,
though this was built to hold the
weight of bookstacks.

RARE BOOK ROOM

Concerning the rare book

naire a copy of jis constitution
and by-laws, as well as a roster
with the names of the entire
membership, which will be kept
on file by the college for future
reference.

Elaborating further on the
college’s need for such informa.
tion. particularly the annual
rosters and evaluations, Dean
Burts pointed out that his office
is often asked for the record of
a student who graduated several
years ago.

As it is now, the college has
no way of knowing which stud-

one which I’ve used ever since.” |

It usually takes no trouble to,
organize some activity with a
frisbee, according to Dr. Martin,
but he's haa some difficulty
lately. For one thing, Joe Rob-
inson hasn’t been by to give
instruction in a long time.

“I saw him just recently,” |
said Dr. Martin, “and asked him
why he hadn‘t been by, and in
explanation he stuck out his
foot. which unfortunately was
broken.”

Hence the activity in the Mar-
tin back yard.-Lacking a frisbee
mate, -he’s forced to play with
it himself, throwing it. picking
it up, and throwing it again. Oc-
casionally he and one of his
sons wiil do battle with it,
. throwing the frisbee straight at
each othe: at close range till
one of them drops it.

Refuting rumors that he had
an official frisbee throwing out-
fit, Dr. Martin said that he has
played in all sorts of costumes,
from business suits to shorts,
depending on the circumstances.
However, he does wear golf
shoes to avoid the occasional
spills he took as a novice.
. “When you're running and it
suddenly floats down at you,
its mighty easy to end up cn
your back,” he says.

was coming around, so I ex-

one for his memory and time.
Back in my room beneath the
spreading gingko tree, I check-

on the building that it refers to
simply as the shop.

CATALOGUE INFORMATION

But I got no further than the
paragraph containing the follow-
ing sentence. “The newer build-
ings, thoroughly modern
throughout, preserve the tie
with tradition by an adherence
in their exteriors to Classical
Revival forms.” So the squat lit-
tle building that’s older than
Chambers or any of the existing
dorms challenges not only its
predestination to be “tempor-
ary,” but also. the great and
hoary tradition of Davidson ex-

All right. But what can I do for the Air Force?

The Air Force needs college trained men and women
as officers. This is caused by the rapidly advancing
technology that goes with hypersonic air and space
flight. Your four years of college have equipped you
to handle complex jobs.

Say I was interested... how can I get to be an officer?
