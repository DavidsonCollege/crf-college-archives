Society’s overdose on sexual harassment

I’ ve just returned from seeing
the play Oleanna with my mother,
and 1am furious. Yes, calm Chris-
tina is furious. I realize that this
play (I hope) was an exaggeration
of the wave of sexual harassment
cries flooding our country, but it
was a good, symbolic representa-
tion of our times.

And what about our times?
That is, after all, what I’m really
writing about. I am a woman, I
enjoy my femininity, and I am be-
hind the traditional women’s role
in society. By saying this I do not
mean that I think women should
always be at home cooking. I
mean to say that I still believe that

men should be respectful of
women, open the doors for them,
and be the suitor in most relation-
ships. Itaggravates me that women
seem to be trying to prove that they
are men. I’m sorry folks, but this
is planet earth and there are only
two genders here, not one. They
are different—just open an
anatomy book orstudy alittle about
hormones.

The worst thing about this
equality fight is that women, yes I
said WOMEN, are making the
world a land mine for men. This
sexual harassment thing has gone
way too far, most especially with
women in the workplace. All right

women, we’ re out here in the work
force, and we can’t take little com-
ments by men about sexually re-
lated topics or how we look? Stop!

Before you go off on me, yes,
I know that there is definitely seri-
ous, real sexual harassment out
there. Ifanyone should know about
it, should. I work with the male-
dominated workforce of EMS, Fire,
and Rescue in this county. I’ve
stood in the middle of an emer-
gency room and had a paramedic
tell me in front of God and every-
one else exactly what he’d like to
do to several of my body parts,
after he’d ripped open my outer
coat to get a betterlook at me. Yes,

I'd classify that as real sexual ha-
rassment, but if a guy is just hitting
on you ("Why won’t you go out
with me, babe?”’) that isnot grounds
for a suit. I’m sure if you were
interested in that guy, you wouldn’t
be offended.

Besides, let's face it, being a
little more open about their sexual
desires is a guy thing. Do guys sue
us for doing that female PMS thing
and treating them like dirt once a
month? No, but why not? It may
offend them. I’m sorry girls, you
are female, and guys don’t shut
their hormones off when you enter
the room. Guys are becoming so
paranoid that it’s making life ter-

rible for those of us who don’t
believe that every guy is a per-
verted rapist.

Some guys that I work with won’t
give me a hand with my rescue
gear just because they’ re afraid I'll
cry “sexual harassment” if they
accidentally touch me—and we’ re
supposed to be a team!

Ladies, if you want to be
treated like men, and/or are
“Oleannas,” tatoo a big equals sign
on your forehead and start wearing
apatch with the letter “S” onit, like
in The Scarlet Letter (to stand for
Sexually Harassed), so that guys
will know which ones of us want to
be treated like ladies.

We are everywhere

We are everywhere. We hide
behind ourscholarly glasses to fool
you. We camouflage our muscles
with preppie clothes and dull our
smell with fashionable cologne.
We are in your classes. We write
the same papers you do. We eat at
the same places as you, and we
study just like you. Many times
we surround you, and you don’t
even know it. Are you scared yet?

- I would tell you what we are, but I
am too afraid. Iam afraid you will

give usastigma. You will perhaps |

isolate us from your normal activi-
ties. You mightavoid us. Who are
we? All right, I guess I should tell
you. We are, well ... we are ath-
letes. No, that’s not quite right, we
are student-athletes. Ah yes, that’s
better, I got it off of my chest.
You see, it’s not that I’m em-
barrassed. No, that’s not quite it. I
think it’s just that I’m scared. I’m
scared that this knowledge might
fall into the minds of the wrong
~ people. It could fall into the minds
of the ignorant, naive, and conde-
scending professor or student.
Okay firie, I have a slight chip
on my shoulder. My problem is
that I think Davidson student-ath-
letes do not get the respect they
deserve. Perhaps it is just me, but
sometimes I sense disapproval
when I go into a professor’s office
to tell her/him that I will miss a

class for a tennis match. I feel
intimidated to even share this in-
formation at all with them, be-
cause I am scared of the stereo-
type. “He’s anathlete,” they might
think.

No, I’m sorry, that’s not true.
You see, I am a student first who
just happens to be an athlete. In
fact, I think that all the student-
athletes on campus are students
first who just happen to be athletes
competing at a Division I level.
Terry Holland, our Athletic Direc-
tor (the best in the nation by the
way), preaches many times in
speeches: “Division I needs
Davidson more than Davidson
needs Division I.” I can’t agree
with this statement more.

Davidson student-athletes per-
sonify the original intentions of
the NCAA. The Davidson stu-
dent-athlete is different than many
other schools. We came here for
an education first.

I think many times, at other
schools, the athletes are athletes
first and hope to get an education if
possible. It is unfair to categorize
these athletes with the student-ath-
letes of Davidson.

Our participation in sports
should be considered no differ-
ently than a hobby of any other
student. Because essentially that’s
what a sport is—a hobby. It’s

something that we love doing very
much, and it is something that we
all work very hard at. But it never
should, never has, and never will
be prioritized over our education. I
don’t think you will find one stu-
dent-athlete at this school that will
do so. If they do, they typically
aren’t here very long.

I am a firm believer that the
true student-athlete has an advan-
tage over the non-student-athlete.
We are better prepared for life af-
ter graduation. We are competi-
tive. We are disciplined. We
handle pressure well. We can give
and receive criticism. And, most
importantly, we are pursuing an
education with just as much drive
as every one else at this college.
People cannot afford to criticize
the athletes here because there are
too many of us.

Criticizing us would be criti-
cizing close to one-third of the
student body. Is it really plausible,
ora legitimate argument to say that
a Davidson student-athlete is not
the student the rest of the non-
student-athletes are? I think not.
‘We are an integral part of this
student body. We are everywhere.
And the scary thing is, most people
don’t even know who we are.
That’s fine. You don’t have to
know. In a way, that’s kind of a
compliment.

What a cryin’ shame

First of all, let me begin by
saying that I’m not entirely sure
how I’m writing this article. Ap-
parently, I’m thoroughly deaf,
dumb, and blind as the newly chris-
tened Helen Keller of Davidson.
Maybe I’m just thinking all these
words, and none of you are really
hearing anything I say. At least
that’s the distinct impression I get
from the recent response to my
“Wildcat” article.

Let’s get this straight. I never
once said, or even hinted, that
Davidson fans should not cheer
whole-heartedly for the men’s bas-
ketball team. Nor didI say that one
should notinvest “one’s heart, soul,
lungs, voices, and hands to that
very vital support.” Nor did I say
we shouldn’t “display the same
wild enthusiasm and spirit that our
players and coaches display.” For
those who wrote responses and
anyone else who doesn’t believe
me, please reread my article thor-
oughly this time. Calm your hos-
tile emotions for a second and ac-
tually listen to what I do have to
say.

I did, and still do, say that
berating referees, o lay-

ers, and coaches is completely un-

acceptable and unbecoming of
Davidson College students. De-
spite notsharingaseatonthebench _ .
with the.team, my extremely lim-
ited experience reminds me that,
fairly or not, entire communities
are judged on the sportsmanship
of their teams and fans. Malicious
fans can forever blemish aschool’s
prized reputation. Supporting

ing one’s team, not nailing the
opposing team. Derision and taunt-
ing have absolutely no place in the
game of basketball.

So listen, there’s one more home
game forthe men’s basketball team
this year. You have my unequivo-
cal blessing to go and cheer your
hearts out. That’s what I’ll be
doing (despite my “white gloves”).
But if you are among the few who
still insist on berating the opposing
team, so be it. You are the ones
that will have to live with the repu-
tation you make for yourself!

By the way, much thanks to the
dozens of people who read and
supported my article. It's good to
know that somebody still reads for
comprehension these days.
