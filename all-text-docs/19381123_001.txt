Leper

Receive Christmas lect
Gift Fund From ‘ty’? °°¢'e&

Korean Lepers Will Benefit
From Annual Christmas

Gift Fund
700 LEPERS TREATED

Dr. R. M. Wilson And Mr. J. K.
Unger Direct Colony

At a meeting after chapel
Monday morning it was decid-
ed by the “Y” Cabinet that}
the annual Christmas gift fund
should be turned over to the
Biederwolf Leper Colony in)
Korea, which is under the di-!
rection of Dr. R. M. Wilson|
and Mr. J. K. Unger, of the
Presbyterian Church, U. 5. |

The money will be used for the
building of a village within the
leper colony for those who have |
been cured of the ,disease. Cured |
lepers are not accepted into society, |
and the building of the village will}
enable many of them to earn their]
own living. It will also enable them}
to enjoy family life, for'the men}
will be-allowed to take a wife and |
adopt one child. |

In Korea |
The colony at present has seven}

} a 1S mi !

hundred inmates, the largest mis-}

sion colony of its kind in the world. |
It is located on a peninsula in Sou-
thern Korea, and it. is reputed to be!
one of the most beautiful spots in}
the world. It is almost completely |
self-supporting as the inmates grow |
crops and catch fish. On one side}

is a beaytiful beach used for swim-

ming. Swimming in salt water is)
one of the cures of leprosy. |
The lepers live in stone huts built |
by themselves, and each year a

prize is given to the house having
the beautiful garden. The
colony has own government,
money, _ jail, store, hospital, and
workshop. Also, there is a theatre
which was given by the Empress
of Japan. Always there are twenty
or thirty lepers outside the gates of
this colony, of which have
walked as far as two or three hun-
dred miles, hoping against hope that
they might be admitted into what
is their dream of paradise

As soon as the-collection is made
it will be possible to admit many
more of these outcasts from society
to the colony. Several chapel talks
to the Davidson student body will
explain the work in detail, and
news will be posted on the bulletin |

Try-Outs Will
Be On Monday

Three Speakers Will Represent
‘School At Winthrop

Try-outs for speakers to repre-
sent Davidson in the annual Win*
throp College public speaking tour-
nament will be held next Monday
night in the Phi Hall.

Three men will be chosen from
those trying out to be the local
representatives at the tournament

of December 4th and 5th. Those
who have signed up for the Mon-
day night trials are: Dick Kenyon,
Bob Ramsey, Drury Thompson,
Paul Crane, Bill Loftin, George
Milne, Tom Fry, Chal Vinson, Sher-
rard Rice, and Frank Barker. Oth-

Contestants may enter in any one of
the following fields: oratory, ex-
temporaneous speaking, impromptu
speaking, harangue, flebate, or aft-
er-dinner speaking. Winners will be
announced in each field.

Immediately following the Win-
throp tournament the interest of
the Forensic council will be center-
ed. upon the varsity debate try-outs,
which will take place about the
second week in September.

After varsity try-outs have been
completed and the team selected,
freshman debate try-oyts will be
held. Both try-outs use the same
question, that of the Pi Kappa Del-
ta national debating fraternity,

Prof. F. B. Wenn Of Georgia
Tech Visits Here

Professon Fred B. Wenn of Geor-
gia School of Technology was a
visiter on the Davidson Campus
Saturday, November the nineteenth.
Professor Wenn, who Is Province
Deputy of Omicron Delta Kappa,
paid a visit to the local O. D. K.
chapter.

A luncheon meeting was held in

from

his honor in Chambers banquet hall.
Student members of the society and
several faculty members were pre-
sent. Professor Wenn delivered an
interesting address on his idea for

O. D. K. activities. Among the
thoughts which he brought out
were some worth while projects

which had been sponsered at Geor-
gia Tech.

In the absence of Warren Gaw,
president of the local organization,
Fred Stair presided and F. L. Jack-
college treasurer, introduced
the speaker.

Professor Wenn journeyed from
here-te—Columbia to jspeak at the
University of South Carolina. Prior
