New coaches inject shot of vitality into b-ball

By SUZANNE CRAYMER

Davidson’s basketball program is
under new leadership with the ap-
pointment of a former assistant coach
and a member of the 1982 national
championship team at the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Bob
McKillop and Matt Doherty were
named
head coach
and _§assis-
tant coach,
respec-
tively, last
May.

McKil-
lop is re-
placing
Bobby
Hussey,
who _ re-
signed in
mid-April
after an
eight-year
record of 108-127. McKillop served as
Davidson’s assistant coach in 1978-79
and returns after 10 years at Lutheran
High School in Long Island, New York.

McKillop left Lutheran with an over-
all record of 182-51, and says he comes
to Davidson with a commitment to win
while maintaining academic integrity,
a sentiment Doherty shares.

“lam looking forward to coaching in
an atmosphere that combines the com-
mitment to excellence in athletics with

Bob McKillop

that of excellence in academics,” stated -

McKillop. “At Davidson, there exists
that rare combination of not only
coaching at the Division I level, but also
the highest possible academic prestige

McKillop demonstrates his commit-
ment to academics by lecturing at such
camps as the National Coaches’ Clinic
and the Italian National Olympic Fed-
eration.

In accepting his position in May,
McKillop identified recruiting as one of
his first priorities. He gained such ex-
perience
while serv-
ing as a
scout for
the Utah
Jazz »-last
year and
working as
Davidson’s
assistant
coach in
1978-79.
During his
year at
Davidson
he re-
cruited ‘83
graduate John Carroll, who holds
Davidson’s second best record in ca-
reer assists. This year McKillop filled
the vacancy caused by the departure of
1988-89 freshman Bruce Elder with
Detlef Musch, one of his players at Lu-
theran.

Assistant coach Doherty started on
North Carolina’s 1982 national cham-
pionship team with Michael Jordan
and James Worthy. He was drafted by
the Cleveland Cavaliers after his senior
season. 2-50uU! bist! GUID gisinG

Due to injuries and other reasons,
Doherty did not remain with the Cava-
liers. He soon moved from basketball
to Wall Street.

Wall Street for four years I realized it
wasn’t what I wanted to do and came
down to Charlotte in the hopes of get-
ting into real estate.”

Yet his longing for basketball lead

‘him into broadcasting the Davidson

games on radio. When McKillop of-
fered him the position in May, he read-
ily accepted and has now been at
Davidson for five months. His main job
is recruiting next year’s team.

According to Doherty,.“There’s a
certain attitude in coaching. You
dream, envision and then expect. The
harder you work, the more you fulfill
your dreams.”

“There are four components of any

good athletic program,” he explained,
“a school athletic director, coaching
staff, a facility and players.”

“We have three and I’m working on
the fourth.”

Citing Davidson’s excellent’ aca-
demic record as well as athletic prom-
ise, Doherty thinks of Davidson as an
easy product to sell prospective play-

, ers. “People from all over want to go

here,” he stated.

In addition to recruiting new players,
Doherty also expects a’ lot ‘from
Davidson’s senior players.

“The program needs a shot in the

rm” he concluded, “and we're going
to give it to them.”

What will Davidson football look like in Division 111?

By JIGGY MAXWELL

Last winter the Davidson
trustees decided, on the recom-
mendation of both the athletic
committee and former Athletic
Director Kit Morris, to drop
football from the Division IAA
level to Division III.

The expected mass exodus of
football players provoked by
the decision left the Wildcats

The Wildcats flexed their muscle in a pre-season scrimage last Friday.

with slightly over 30 returning
players, only 13 of whom can
be considered returning start-
ers. This gives fifth-year head
coach Vic Gatto an excellent
core for his starting lineup; but
where this core ends is where
the problems for the 1989 sea-
son begin. With only a dozen
or so freshmen joining the
squad, the biggest challenge

facing Coach Gatto and his
staffis developing a depth that
will be sorely needed in the
latter part of the season, as in-
juries begin to take their toll.
Finding a starting quarter-
back seemed like the least of
the Wildcats’ worries as Peter
Hughes, the starter for the bet-
ter part of the last three years,
seemed ready to return for his

_ Ready to replace Hughes are

junior Mark Wainwright and
sophomore Matt Matheny.
Both are capable but un-

proven since neither has seen

playing time during the regu
lar season.

The offensive line (avg. 63",
250 Ibs.) should be strong this
year as Gat Caperton and Burt
Williams return for the fourth
year. Add lastyear’s offensive
MVP junior Chris Woods, jun-
ior Paul Byrne, sophomore
Ashton Lloyd, and senior Jeff
Swyers, and the Wildcats’ of-
fensive line should match up
well with every defense on
their schedule.

Behind this beefy line is
what could be a collection of
the best backs Coach Gatto
has ever assembled at
Davidson. With a switch to
the Power I formation this fall
for a more ball-control
offense, the Wildcats should

improve on the 135 yards per

game they averaged in 1988.
