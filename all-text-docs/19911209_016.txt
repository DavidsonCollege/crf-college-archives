Davidson student friends .of
Habitat for Humanity are invited
to two upcoming events -- a house
dedication and a Christmas party.

Many students helped Habitat
build a home at 934 N. Main St.
which will be dedicated next Sun-
day, Dec. 15. Celebration of the
completion of this, Habitat’s sev-
enth home in Davidson, begins at4
p.m. that day on the site (between
Ridge Road and the Anchor Grill.)
New Habitat homeowner Betty
Norton will invite those present
inside to see the final product of
their work.

’ The dedication ceremony will
be led by Rev. Brenda Tapia, di-
rector of Love of Learning and will
include a blessing of the house,
presentation of a Bible to Norton,
aresponse from her, and hymns. A
representative from the Meck-
lenburg County Department of
Community Development willalso
speak on behalf of that govern-
ment group, which funded the
house. Habitat undertook the proj-
ectwhen approached by the county
government, which needed to find
anew home for Mrs. Norton. Rather
than contracting with commercial

firms, the county saved money
through Habitat’s involvement, and
Habitat was able to help a long-
time Davidson resident.

The annual Habitat Christmas
party will begin at 6 p.m. on
Wednesday, Dec. 18, at Reeves
Temple AME Zion Church in
Davidson. The public is invited to
bring a covered dish for supper,
and then stay for storytelling and
music by Sauni Wood of Davidson.

Habitat’s mission is to help
local families who want to own a
home, but can’t afford a big down

payment and market-rate mort-
gages. Habitat buildsitsnew homes
with volunteer labor and a certain
number of hours of “‘sweat equity”
labor from the homeowners. The
homeowner then buys the house
through a no-interest loan, which
translates into a $180 monthly
mortgage. In turn, Habitat expects
that new homeowners will take
more interest in their community
and be better Davidson citizens
than renters.

Students interested in helping
fund Habitat efforts should contact
Mary Faith Mount, chairman of
the Reach Out Habitat committee,
at 896-6633.
