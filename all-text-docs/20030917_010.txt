Looking Ahead: Women’s Basketball
Watts, women aim to ‘hang

banners’ with veteran squad

By BEN WHIGHAM
Staff Writer

Coming off their best season in years, the
women’s basketball program finds itself at a
defining moment in its young tenure under
head coach Annette Watts. With four starters
returning and a much improved depth chart,
Watts is poised to make good on her promise

to establish a tradition that “will hang ban- -

ners.”

Last season, the team’s second under Watts,
saw the ’Cats finish 15-15 overall and 8-10 in
the Southern Conference. This was a refresh-
ing break after three straight seasons with-10
wins or less. The team’s improved record and
impressive march to the semifinals of the
conference tournament has them thirsting for
more.

“After advancing to the semi-finals of the
conference tournament we had a small taste of
success,” says Robyn Flewelling 04. Accord-
ing to Flewelling, that taste “has propelled us
to work even harder this off-season.”

The true test lies on the court, where the
Cats will have the advantage of returning
nearly all of last year’s squad. Only two play-
ers, Bethany Schott and Leah Uhernick ’03,
were lost to graduation. Uhernick, an emo-
tional leader on the team, suffered a torn ACL
last season and never took the court. Schott,
however, served as a leader on the floor, and
her 7.7 rebounds per game will be missed.
Though her absence will hurt the ’Cats, return-
ing four starters means there will be no lack of
experience.

“The entire senior class will provide leader-
ship for this team,” says Courtney Laird ’04,

who will serve as a captain along with Ashley
Halisted ’04.

With the team apparently stronger than ever,
the greatest threat lies in its recently announced
schedule. The ’Cats open the season on Nov
22 with the Spartan Classic, a tournament
featuring three conference opponents ranked
in the top twenty-five. Only days later, the
’Cats will pack up and travel to San Francisco
to compete in the Lady Dons Tournament. The
competition will include Kentucky and
Duquense.

“Playing against such good teams can only
make you better,” notes Watts.

After this brutal opening, the ’Cats will play
only two more non-conference opponents,
Georgia Tech and Winthrop.f Still, they will

face plenty of obstacles in their twenty confer-.

ence matches.

The Southern Conference features many
teams with a high percentage of returning
starters. Chattanooga, who will come to
Davidson on Jan 12, returns three-fifths of the
squad that won the conference championship
a year ago. Western Carolina and Appalachian
State, two of the ’Cats’ fiercest rivals, are
looking tougher than ever. Davidson will also
face Southern\Conference newcomer Elon on
Jan 17 and Feb 14. If this is to be the ’Cats’
year, they will have to manage against some of
the toughest competition in school history.

As for the team’s aims, Watts leaves no
room for ambiguity: “The players have come
back in good shape and are ready to accom-
plish our goals of TLC: twenty wins, loyalty
and a conference championship.”

Even with the team’s strengthened status,
the talent-saturated Southern Conference will

Cook, from page 12

this past weekend, Cook’s injury was inevi-
table, and if the ’Cats expect to do anything
this season, the beat-up O-line needs to step it
up."

“Tf we can protect for Cook, and he puts the
money on the ball, we'll be in good shape,”
commented Toop. “He’s improved each week
over the past three—especially in his mechan-
103," 5

Asked whether.a dual quarterback offense
might be put in place, Toop turned down the
idea, saying, “You have to put one guy on the
horse and let him ride. We won’t shuttle guys
back and forth.”

With the offensive line as beat up as it is,
Cook will have to use his legs more than he
would like to while avoiding a multitude of
oncoming rushes, but the security of the start-
ing nod may help his confidence. A big test
will come this week against Butler, when the
offense will have yet another chance to put
points on the board, something that has eluded
them so far this season.

“We knew where the ball needed to go, and
it was just a matter of putting the ball in place
and making throws,” commented Cook on the
lack of offensive movement against San Di-
ego. “[It’s] just a matter of physically making
plays.”

A greater challenge may be taking an 0-3
team out of the cellar and get them ready for
the challenges that lay ahead. A sophomore is
not asked to lead a team often, but if he’s the
man holding the ball, he’ II have to pick up the
slack.

“Our immediate goal is to focus week to
week and come out and beat Butler Saturday
and get a win,” said Cook. “(The PFL Cham-
pionship] is always in the back of our minds,
but we’ ve just got to worry about Butler right
now.”

Perhaps the more immediate goal, though,
is our QB’s health. Let’s hope the week’s
prognosis is a good one.
