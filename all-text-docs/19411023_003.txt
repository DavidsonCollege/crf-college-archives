Davidson inaugurated John Rodd
Cunningham as twelfth President of
the College with elaborate exercises
in Chambers auditorium on Sat-
urday morning, October 18th, at
10:30 A. M.

Present were one hundred twenty
official representatives of
tional institutions and learned
cieties, the faculty, many members
of the student body, and a large
number of alumni and friends here
for the homecoming celebration,

Academic Procession

The program began with an aca-
demic procession of the delegates,
wearing their robes and colorful
hoods, across the campus and into
the auditorium, The Davidson Col-
lege band led the procession, play-
ing the strains of “Largo.”

When the delegates had reached
their places, the whole audience
joined in singing the hymn, “Her-
alds_of-_Christ-’—_-Dri__Gharles _ E
Diehl, President of Southwestern at
Memphis, read Psalms 1 and 15 as
the scripture. Then Dr. Daniel S.
Gage, Professor of Bible and Phil-
osophy at Westminister College and
an old friend of Dr. Cunningham
led the assembly in a prayer for
divine guidance for the incoming
President.

Dr. J. McD. Richards, President
of the Trustees of Davidson College,
presided and introduced Dr. Walter
L. Lingle, retiring President, who in
turn presented Dr. Cunningham for
the inauguration ceremony. Dr.
Lingle said*that for a man to be
President of Davidson College he
must be a Christian, a gentleman,
a scholar, and a good business man
and that he must possess leadership
ability, be able~to get along with
the faculty, and be able to promote
good relations between the College
and the Church. He explained that
Dr. Cunningham is a man possessing
all these qualities. He also gave
a brief summary of Dr Cunning-
ham’s life.

Coming around to his announced

predictable times which we are now
facing and said that faith in God
now, as in the past, would continue
to sustain the College in its work.

He then enumerated several obli-

to provide individual attention; sec-

Christian influence. He said that in|
Christianity men are sons of God}
