Biologists irk fishermen
off wild Alaskan coast

By CATHY ANSHELES
Staff Writer

Junior Irv Wilson has been on an
Alaskan voyage.

Last Christmas Wilson applied to
the Pacific Marine Center branch of
the National Oceanic and Atmos-
pheric Administration for a job on the
research boat The Oregon.

Hearing that no space was left,
Wilson went to Anchorage Alaska
where he and his cousin obtained a job
on the Alaskan Pipeline. His job was
mainly security work, Wilson ex-
plained, checking for leaks and da-
mages along the pipeline.

He spent two weeks at Prudhoe Bay
and was then transferred to Chandalar
Camp which Wilson says is in the
Brooks Range.

Around the middle of August Wilson
returned to Anchorage where he
‘played around for a couple of weeks.”’

Returning from a trip to Mt. McKin-
ley, Irv was told he was needed for The
Oregon.

Given the title of ‘ordinary fisher-
man’’ Wilson was a member of an eight
man crew on the 100 foot long boat.

They left Sand Point, an island near
the end of the Alaskan peninsula, on
September 3.

‘‘Fishing,’’ Wilson explained, ‘‘is
very slow traveling,’”’ so the trip took
three weeks to get to-Kodiak Island.

Also on board The Oregon were two
biologists from the National Marine
Fisheries Service which initiated the
survey of the shrimp populations in
certain waters of the Gulf of Alaska.

Starting at 7:00 in the morning, the
fishermen made six to eight ‘‘trawls”’ a
day.

Wilson explained ‘‘trawling’”’ as the
pulling of a cone-shaped net along the
bottom of the Gulf.

When the fish were hauled on board
they were sorted according to species,
counted, weighed and then dumped
back. Wilson described his job as
helping sort the fish and cleaning off
the deck.

The scientific information was used
to determine if certain areas should be
opened, closed or limited for commer-

cial shrimping.

Every fourth night Wilson said he
had to ‘‘sit and anchorwatch”’ which k
lasted from 9 pm to 5 am. He worked
from 12 to 24 hours a day, receiving
about $12.50 an hour, and according
to Wilson, ‘‘it was good food.”

Although he had been on commercial
fishing boats before Wilson said his
voyage on The Oregon was his longest
without going on shore.

The second half of the trip, from
Kodiak Island to Seattle, Washington,
lasted two weeks and five days.

It took longer than normal due to a
storm which Wilson stated was ‘‘one
of the worst storms the Alaskan coast
had ever experienced.

A good deal of the journey was spent
sitting out the storm in harbors.

“The barometer dropped below re-
cord,’’ and, according to Wilson, winds
were up to 70 mph and waves as high as
20 feet.

Wilson mentioned that he was able to
form a collection of fish and inverte-
brate animals during the trip and is
receiving a 301 credit in Biology.

The junior from Sanston, Va.d
noticed some _ incompatability~
between the biologists and fishermen S$
and feels that this was due to certain -
background differences.

“Certain incidents on the boat dis-
sappointed me’’ Wilson stated and he is
no longer interested in being a National
Marine Fisherman.

Concerning the field of Marine Biolo-
gy, Wilson concluded, “I like it and
enjoy it but I don’t want to spend my
life in it. I would rather have my feet on
land and sneak out to sea every once in
a while.”’

Wilson, here soggy and complacent, had to spend many days anchorwatching
and waiting out storms. But there were good times too. [Irv Wilson]

Banal Superman depends on hype

weather, it’s time to look ahead to
Hollywood’s coming attractions.

Looming large on the horizon is
Superman. Like King Kong, Superman
is depending on hype and special effects
to sell what appears to be a very banal
picture.

Marlon Brando got paid quite han-
though one doubts a cameo appear-
ance can save a disaster. One thing
that may: the special effects crew is
reportedly working on a holographic
process that would allow Superman to
fly off the screen as a finale.
screen as a finale.

Now that could really take the
audience’s breath away.

Next on the agenda is a whole string
of films about the Vietman war and teh
Rober DeNiro
should give one of his reliable perfor-
mances in The Deer Hunter, a film
which apparently plays up the humor
element of the war at the expense of any
social or political message.

Francis Ford Coppola’s Apocalpse
Now will soon reveal whether he can
work the Godfather magic again with a
picture that literally has to be a
blockbuster in order to succeed.

In case this doesn’t satisfy all you
war mongers, Robert Stone’s Dog
Soldiers is coming to a theater near you
sometime late this year.

For topics closer to home, Paul
Schrader’s Blue Collar offers a violent
attack on the American auto industry
and feature Richard Pryor, Yaphet
Kotto and Harvey Keitel.

Keitel gets a work out in tw other
films, Fingers and The Duellists, which
must mark a step up for someone
‘previously known for giving the best
three minute performances of the year.

In foreign films, Americans seemed
to have stopped importing films and
starting importing directors. Italian
Lina Wertmuller, German R.W. Fass-
binder and tax-exile Ingmar Bergman
all have movies coming out in English.

Judging by the mixed response
received by Wertmuller’s and Berg-
man’s efforts (both films have just been
released), Fassbinder looks like the best
bet. Based on a novel by Vladimir
Nabokov, Despair has a script by Tom
Stoppard.

Francophiles should enjoy Jean
Charles Tacchellia’s Blue Country, the
director’s first film since Cousin, Cou-
sine.

Robert Altman’s A Wedding will
either be a masterpiece or an absolute
disaster, depending on which side of the
Altman controversy you are on.

On top of all this, there will be all the
usual trash that make American movies
