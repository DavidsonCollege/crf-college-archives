Students Cry ‘Fooey’ Over King Kudzu

At story hour, eyes rolled
back white in a trance, Numb
Elroy scourges himself into
mystic foresight with the twig
of a natty hawthorn bush.

“Chapter VII: Governance
Hall. A throng of bearded men,
in sad-colored garments and
gray, steeple-crowned hats, in-
termixed with students, some
wearing hoods and others
bareheaded, was assembled in
front of a brick edifice, the door
of which was heavily timbered
with oak, and studded with
iron spikes.

‘On both sides of the door, ar-
mored like the Swiss Guard,
stood sullen ROCS (once
thought to be figments of the
sand-blasted Bedouin
imagination). Ronco rifles at
the ready, they guarded the

first annual meeting of the
Davoidson Governance Com-
mittree.

“The two-ton doors inched
open to reveal a crystal chan-
delier shaped like Marshal
Ney'’s ribcage and a long
mahogany table with K.K. em-
blazoned in the center in green
and with three extra leaves on
the side. The throng filed into
the torch-lit room and along the
sides of the meeting table.

“Then, the rattle of shivering
brown leaves along the ground
and the chairbush of the com-
mittree, King Kudzu himself,
called the meeting to disorder.

The professors fingered their
beards and thumped the crowns
of their hats: the students spun
the propellors on their beanies.

‘King Kudzu spread his vines
in welcome and rattled off his
Opening speech.

* ‘Students and Voters, wel-
come to date. We are here to
decide upon Davoidson's fate.”

“‘Whereupon, the leader of the
students kowtowed seven times
and spoke.

* ‘Uh, th-thank you, King, sir.
Thank you v-very much for, uh,
for letting us, well, you know,
for letting us kind of well, sit in
on the meeting and_ all.
Anyhow.”

‘And the students took their
places on the left side of the
table for the voting to begin.
Kudzu pointed a long leaf at H.
Eadmans the White to begin the
prefacatory cheer.

‘Kudos, Kudzu!
Kudzu! Kudos, Kudzu!"

“Then, the business began.

‘* ‘First order of business:
Resolve that the dormitory
drinking fountains should be
closer to the lavatories, for
those who drink and run. Open
to debate.’

** ‘Well, uh,’ said the student
leader, ‘I think...’

‘Debate is now closed.
Those in favor say ‘‘yea."'

“The students Yea-ed.

‘* ‘Those opposed say “‘nay.”’’

“The professors nayed.”

Kudos,

* “The proposition is unan-
imously denied. Second or-
der of business: Resolve that
Chambers Building, Dana and
Martin Science Buildings andthe
Cunningham Fine Arts Center
be remodeled as locker rooms
for the Davoidson golf team.
Students, please leave the
premises.”

** ‘What?’ quipped the student
leader.

** ‘Students please leave the
premises. It is the decision of
this committree that this is a
matter grave beyond your
years.”

* ‘Grave, huh? Beyond my
years, huh? Well, let me tell you
something. Your...your father’s
moustache and...and take it in

directions.

** ‘So you think we can't han-

screeched the students. ‘Think
we're immature, huh?’

“Europe °72” Captures Dead's

Spirited Concert Performances

A REVIEW

By WILL ROBERTSON
Staff Writer

Most bands concentrate on
their studio recordings and give
concerts just to keep them-
selves in the public eye. Con-
sequently, their concerts are of-
ten rather dull and sloppy.

The Grateful Dead, on the
other hand, are at their best in
concert. A Dead concert is an
orgiastic party that lasts
anywhere from three to eight
hours.

One night, they played for a
joyous Fillmore East audience
until sunrise. An outdoor Dead
concert on.a bright summer af-
ternoon is the ultimate event in
American rock performance.

“Europe ‘72, The Grateful
Dead in Concert’ is a three
record set, recorded in April
and May last year, that cap-
tures the energy of the group's
performances. The material is
well chosen, and the album is
skillfully mixed, with audience
applause cut out.

This album continues in the
direction of ‘‘Workingman’'s
Dead,” with a country flavor
and a bouncy, fresh rhythm. It
is impossible to sit still while
listening to this album.

While most of the songs are
conventional Dead rock, drawn
from recent albums, there are
some surprises.

In ‘One More Saturday
Night,” the Dead show that they
can play pure rock ‘n roll as
well as anyone. Bob Weir plays
the guitar like Chuck Berry,
while Keith Godchaux bangs
the piano energetically, God-
chaux is outstanding
throughout, and is largely
responsible for the album's
superiority over the previous

live releases.

Another surprise is an
Elmore James blues tune,
“Hurts Me Too.’ Godchaux
plays good blues piano, and
‘‘Pigpen’’ McKernan's harp
work is outstanding. Elmore
himself would be pleased with
this version of his blues classic.

The highlight of the album is
the Dead's rendition of ‘*Mor-
ning Dew.” It builds slowly,
with a long instrumental in-
troduction, and climaxes with a
long guitar solo by Jerry Garcia
that will send chills down your
spine.

The quality of the album is
equal to that of studio recor-
dings. The vocals are spirited
and pretty throughout, ex-
ceptional for a concert recor-

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

ding. The instrumentals are
tactful, with none of the slop-
piness of many live per-
formances.

I realize that this review
sounds as if it came from the
Dead's publicity man, but the
album is outstanding---among
the best concert albums ever.

It is a necessary addition for
old Dead Heads, and a good
starter album for the novice. It
even comes with a set of pic-
tures that you can paste on the
wall beside your portrait of
David Cassidy.

Life is difficult, so you owe it
to yourself to spend some time
wth the Grateful Dead. They
make you feel good.

Newspaper Cuts Detrimental

To the Editor:

Like his counterpart in the
Nixon administration Casper
Weinberger, C. David Cornell
has inestimably molded the
future of Davidson College by
denying DAVIDSONIAN sub-
scriptions to the Board of
Visitors in the interest of
“economy.”

No one can deny the im-
portance of the Board of
Visitors in recruiting prospec-
tive students for Davidson.

To successfully execute this
job, the board needs to stay well
informed on campus issues and
activities. It logically follows
that the better informed the
board is, the higher the quality
of incoming students.

As things will stand after this
year, however, the major com-
munication this board will have
with Davidson doings will be
through that milktoast propa-

ganda pusher called the Up-

date.
1 maintain that _ this

publication is not very
representative of what a
prospective student needs to or
wants to know.

In order for the board to per-
form competently, it needs to
receive both the Updateand THE
DAVIDSONIAN.

If Dr. Cornell were truly in-
terested in saving money as op-
posed to keeping an oc-
casionally controversial
publication out of the hands of
some distinguished alumni, he
would cut appropriations for
sending the Update to students.

True, we would not have
something to laugh over once a
month, but this loss is not
nearly as profound in future im-
pact as his present plan.

I will speak of Pearl's rich
and luxuriant beauty: a beauty
that shone with deep and vivid
tints: a bright complexion, eyes
possessing intensity both of
depth and glow. and hair alrea-
dy of a deep. glossy brown, and
which, in after years, would be
nearly akin to black.

“There was fire in him and
throughout him; he seemed the
unpremeditated offshoot of a
passionate moment.

The leader whipped out Pearl's
nemesis: chartreuse kryp-
tonite, the only kryptonite able
to plunge Pear! into the throes of
irregularity.

“And so, the students won
their rights and took command
of the Governance Committree
and their own affairs.

the student leader. ‘Resolve

Duke Students Ticket Cars (Too)

Duke University employs 37 student traffic monitors
to ticket cars from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through
Friday. According to Preston Stainback, Duke traffic
coordinator, the monitoring system has proved to be a
necessary one because ‘‘the police have so much else»
to do."’ Stainback added that the system, which has
been in effect for over two and a half years, has been
fairly successful.

According to the monitors, there is a good deal of
public relations work to do, too. Monitor Leslie Haines
gets notes that give a ‘‘a million excuses for illegal
parking; usually it is a dire emergency or ‘I lost my
sticker.’

‘Guys have also tried to pick up girl monitors...to
avoid a ticket,” she said. Monitor Gary Libby admits
that he was almost run over by an onlooker for
ticketing a car. Monitor Ann Cocher got to the heart of
the public relations problem between student monitor
and student when she explained that a lot of people
ask, ‘‘How do you dare ticket students?”

Tuition Raised at Mary Baldwin

Mary Baldwin's tuition fee will rise $150 for resident
students and $495 for non-residents next year. ‘‘Just
as in any other institution in the country, expenses at
Mary Baldwin have increased down the line,” ex-
plained Craven Williams, vice-president. **As in the
case of industry, we must pass along a portion of our
cost increases to our customers.”’ Next year, the total
cost for resident students will be $3900 and $1975 for

non-resident students.
