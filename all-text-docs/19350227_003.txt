NATHAN SPEAKS
ON RADIO HOUR

Prominent Economist Speaks On
Knowledge Gained From
Depression

In lieu of the weekly musical radio
program, Davidson had the honor of
having as guest-speaker on the Davidson
hour Dr. Otto Nathan, prominent inter-
national economist.

Dr. Nathan was visiting the college as
a speaker of the I. R: C. convention. He
was introduced to his audience by Dr.
Archibald Currie, professor of political’
science. According to Dr. Currie, Nathan
was born and educated iri Germany, and
after the war rapidly forged his way to
the top of the statistical bureau in his
native country,

In 1930 he made a lecture tour of
America, serving as guest-lecturer in
New York University and the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania. After returning
to his native country, he made another
trip to America in 1933, and has been
in this country ever since. At present
he is on the faculty of Princeton Uni-
versity.

)In his introduction Dr. Nathan
brought out that we are passing through
a period of madness, a period conform-
ing to the 1914-1918 period, which proved
to thinking men that mankind has not
yet learned to administer to the world.

He said that we should let the expe-
riences of the last several years teach
us lessons for the future. Sounding a
note of cheer, he stated that all evidence
points to one fact—we have reached and
passed the lowest period of the depres-
sion.

For the body of the lecture, Dr. Na-
than took two points and developed each
from several angles. His first point was,
“What can we learn from the “depres-
sion?” Regarding this, he showed that
the depression has revealed that politics
and economics are closely tied together.
Their development is simultaneous.

This depression has been world-wide
and has shown us that the world as a
whole is an ceonomic and trade unit.
Prohlems must bé solved on an interna-
tional basis. We have completely failed
in international economic relations here-
tofore.

After world recovery has been
achieved, there are three problems to be
faeed: 1—A restoration of an interna-
tional currency system; 2—A resumption
of foreign trade; 3—Planned economy is
impossible in our present individualistic
capitalistic system.

In conclusion, Dr. Nathan emphasized
the fact that no lasting economy is pos-
sible if we do not change the interna-
tional political outlook. ‘We should be
citizens of the world,” he said.

cAmong the
GREEKS

All the Greek letter social fraternities
on the campus this week have been hosts
to many parties, feeds, and other social
entertainments for the International Re-
lations Club Convention here. Many
delegates expressed their high opinion
and praises of gratitude for these cour-
tesies shown to them.

Beta Theta Pi: A very enjoyable feed
was attended by many of the brothers
last Sunday night. Plans have and are
being made for repairs on the walk,
lawn, and furniture in the house.

Pi Kappa Alpha: “Barney” Sherrill
from Vanderbilt University was the vis-
iting alumnus over the week-end. A
party is to be given by the Beta Chapter
Saturday, March 2.

Kappa Sigma: The initiation is to be
very soon for the Delta Chapter. A

SPONSORING DRIVE FOR UNIFORMS

BAND NEEDS YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS

Next Friday ‘night Da Davidson College's
Concert Band will give a program in
Chambers Auditorium, the second of its
kind in the last two years, for the pur-
pose of raising funds for uniforms. There
will be no admission charge made, but
a free-will offering will be taken from
the audience after the program, the pro-
ceeds of which will go toward the pur-
chase of uniforms.

It is indeed regrettable to know that
for the past four or five years the Da-
vidson Band has been without special
uniforms and in their stead has been
forced to use the R. O. T. C. equipment
for all occasions. However, for the past
two years the lack of uniforms has be-
some vastly more evident, for in these
two years this organization has devel-
oped by leaps and bounds into one of the
best and largest of its kind in the state
if not in the South. In one year it has
increased in size from fifty to eighty
pieces.

During the past football season the
Davidson Band received much favorable
comment in the newspapers for their ex-
cellent performances at the games. It
has been superior in every respect but
its appearance. A band which has gained

such recognition should have an appear-
ance on a par with its excellence. <A
neat, uniform appearance would not only
stimulate more interest on the part of
the spectators, but it would also better
the morgle of the players.

It is sincerely hoped that it will not
be a matter of two or three years longer
before this band can be equipped prop-
erly, but that the students, alumni and
friends will be liberal in their contribu-
tions so that uniforms can be bought in
the near future.

The following are a few opinions con-
the for uniforms:

Science Students
Witness Pictures

Thursday night, February 21, in the
Chemistry Laboratory Building, students
in the various sciences were shown six
reels of scientific motion pictures. All
the pictures were silent, but accompanied
by full printed explanation.

The first pictures were two reels illus-
trating the growth of cotton, from the
seed to the mattfe plant, and then the
different processes through which it was
taken to produce the finished product.

The next two reels gave the story of
sugar, from the seed of the sugar cane
plant to the final refining of the sugar
itself.

The last two reels illustrated the dan-
gers that accompany the obtaining of
drinking water and public drinking cups.
It presented arguments proving the un-
desirability of dippers (aluminum) and
tin cups usually found at public drink-
ing places.

This was the third in a series of pic-
tures to be shown this semester for the
benefit of students in chemistry, biology
and physics.
