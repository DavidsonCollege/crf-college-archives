New Visulite

By ROBERT BOWIE
Staff Writer

Charlotte, there is more to the film
world than Grease.

The Visulite Theater, reopened this
summer, promises to show the best in
old and foreign movies. Humphrey
Bogart, Groucho Marx and R.W. Fass-
binder’s latest alike beam from the
projector located on 1615 Elizabeth
Avenue.

A year ago that projector briefly
flickered out because of low receipts. The
return of the Visulite now brightens the
cultural opportunities of the entire area.

Some of the films on the Visulite’s
schedule are ‘‘intellectual’’, demanding
much from the audience. The vast
majority are not—they simply lack the
publicity that sells current American
movies. Of the current schedule, I would
count only Fellini’s Satyricon as a
‘‘deep’’ picture beyond the powers of the
average viewer. No one should feel

intimidated and everyone should take |

advantage of a program chosen mainly
for quality.

The new Visulite shows three different
double features weekly except for one
and two week runs of foreign films such
as My Brilliant Career or The Marriage
of Maria Braun.

The old Visulite relied mostly on long
runs of foreign films, although in spring
1979 it held a ‘‘Hurray for Hollywood”’
festival with the co-sponsorship of a
Charlotte radio station. Yet when the
comparatively well-attended festival of
old Hollywood movies ended, the old
Visulite closed its doors, citing financial
difficulties caused by generally poor
attendance.

A recent takeover by Movie, Inc.
made the return of the Visulite possible.
Movie, Inc. operates a chain of repertory
theatres across the country. By renting

films for more than one theatre, and
owning other movies outright, Movie,
Inc. allows theatres in comparatively
small towns to show the best in cinema.

(Movie, Inc. also owns the Rhodes
Theatre in Atlanta and the Rhodes’
schedule is often a preview of the
Visulite’s.)

Hopefully, Movie, Inc.’s money, or-
ganization, and commercial good sense
‘ will guarantee the continued existence of
the Visulite.

Susan Weber, manager of the new
Visulite, said receipts so far have been
“‘great.’’ She added, ‘‘We’re well ahead
of company predictions of attendance at
this stage.”’

And the upcoming schedule would
seem to guarantee a continued busy

ticket office. Science fiction freaks will
delight in the double bill of the gooey
Alien with the swashbuckling Zardoz
this weekend (September 19 and 20)
Errol Flynn devotees can come out of
hiding on September 23 to catch Captain
Blood and Adventures of a Robin Hood.

Fellini’s Satyricon is the great Italian
director’s version of The Waste Land.
Like Elliot’s poem, Satyricon wallows in
degradation and spiritual desolation
until the characters take a desparate leap
of faith that leads to salvation. Fellini's
Roma will also be shown Sept. 24-25,
two very cerebral days.

I know nothing about Ira Wahl’s Best
Boy (to be shown September 26-October
2) other than it won the Academy Award

for Best Documentary and also is the

has fine films, audience, and apple juice

subject of one of the most obnoxious ads
in cinematic history. Peter Seller’s
achieves his crowning role in Hal
Ashby’s Being There (October 3-4),
Humphrey Bogart looks mean as a
detective in The Big Sleep and The
Maltese Falcon, and many beautiful
French women appear unclad in Em-
manuele. All in all, there will be
something for everyone at the Visulite.

A recent trip to the theatre showed
that the Visulite has retained some of its
former trappings. The films were of good
quality, you can still get apple juice at
the concession stand, and the bathroom
floors still had the hand-laid tile floors so
common to the old movie houses.

But the new Visulite has something
the old theatre didn’t—an audience.
