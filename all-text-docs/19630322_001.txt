Vagabonds’ Cloud Clears:
Secretarial Help Appears

BY BRITT SNIDER
Davidsonian Staff Writer

A patch of sunlight seems to be appearing on the
agabonds.

graying future of the

Bill Trotter, a sophomore
student representative to the
Vagabond Governing Board, re-
ports that secretarial assistance,
long @ problem for the group,
has now been acquired by the
college and that the student co-
ordinators have agreed to re-
main until the end of the semes-
ter.

This, however, does not mean
that all of the Vagabonds’ prob-
lems have been solved. Trans-
portation, says Trotter, has been
a problem all year. “We had
understood we could get some
method of transportation read-
ily accessible to the drama de-
partment. This has not been
provided and in many cases, had
to be financed by Dr. W. F.
Goodykoontz and several of the
students.” He added that the
most pressing need at present
was a faculty member to direct
a final production which the
Vagabonds are hoping to under-
take.

Trotter himself is busy pre-
paring his NOVEMBER RE-
QUIEM for presentation at the
Drama Festival in Chapel Hill,
April 44. The play, which con-
cerns the tragedy of the Hun-
garian Revolution of 1956 and
the sacrifice of men dying for
a hopeless cause, was one of
four such plays chosen by the
Carolina Dramatic Association
as worthy of production.

Since the festival is being
held during spring vacation,
Trotter has had some difficulty
in casting. Only the lead has
been officially determined, that
being handled by Gerald Jones,
a drama major from University
of Florida. Rehearsals will be
held during spring vacation, and
Trotter has asked that anyone

interested in helping with it
please contact him.

In other news in the drama
department, two one-act plays,
written by Davidson students
will be presented in Hodson Hall
on March 27 and 28. The first,
written by sophomore Smith
McKeithen of Greenwich, Conn.,
is entitled “John” and deals
with the significance of the last
days of John the Baptist. The
play is being directed by Tom
Hamilton, a senior from Kin-
ston, N. C.

The second play, entitled
“The Play of Man,” is written
by Bill Hagen, a senior from
Falls Church, Va. The cast
consists of three prisoners,
portrayed by Lewis Norman,
a sophomore, Rick Brand, a
sophomore and Sidney Far-
rar, @ freshman. The action
revolves around their search
for certainty and an answer
to the problems they face.
Directing this play is Pete
Myers, sophomore from Pen-
sacola, Flea. Professor J. R.
Gross is faculty supervisor
for the plays.

In still other news, Mr. R. J.
Sailstad, chairman of the Vaga-

It was the time of day that is the best for sleeping here at Davidson. And so, in

Auditorium at 10:20 a week ago Thursday.

I walked into the cold-hard
‘structure with the arched win-
dows, which is used for every-
thing from concerts to prayers;
and I was hoping for a good,
restful snooze. Dr. Edward
Grant, the Moderator of the Gen-
eral Assembly of the Presbyter-
ion Church of the United States,
was the chapel speaker for the
day.

He no sooner started droning
in his Scottish accent than I
started dozing. I had a sort of a
dream—I thought I was in John-
ston Gymnasium, and Fred Het-
zel has just fouled out of the
game after scoring his 46 points
against Jacksonville. At least
that’s what it sounded like. For
all of a sudden an almost stand-
ing ovation had broken out a-

round me.

So | turned to the fellow
who usually sleeps in the seat
beside me and asked what in
the world all of the commotion
was about. He hastily explain-
ed that the speaker had got-
ten off the subject of religion
long enough to make a crack
about college administrators.
That was the simple reason
for the thunderous applause
that had awakened me.

Naturally, I would not like for
anyone to think that all of these
foregoing reflections are in any
way the real purpose of the
article. No, these first few para-

_graphs have merely served as a

brief introduction.
The real message that I would
like to bring you is the fact that

from all three classes are post-

The candidates polling the

Male Chorus Tour
Begins Tomorrow

The Davidson College Male
Chorus leaves by chartered bus

present one of two programs,
sacred or formal, at each stop
on its itinerary, the program
depending on where the concert

The four awards brought Dav-

to 40 — more than any other
college in the South. And only
five Southern universities have
more winners than Davidson:
Duke, Johns Hopkins, U.N.C.,
U. of Texas, and Vanderbilt.

The fellowships, much sought
after by graduate students who
plan careers as college teachers,
cover tuition and fees at the
graduate school of the student's
choice plus a $1500 stipend and
dependency allowance. Candi-
dates must be nominated by a
faculty member and then pass
rigorous eliminations based on

a written statement and two
interviews.
Duvall, who was recently

elected to Phi Beta Kappa, is
serving as chairman of the
Elections Board of the Student
Council. He is a math major,

Scheduled for use then are a
pier, a boat ramp, and a swim-

The pier, already completed,
will eventually be connected by
a ramp to a floating dock with
boat slips. Although the ramp —
is ready for use now, it will be
necessary to put gravel on the
road leading to it before boats
can be driven on the road. The
swimming area is near the boat-
ing facilities and will consist of
a small peninsula for picnicking
and sun-bathing, a beach area
separated from the water by a
bulkhead, and a diving platform
away from the bulkhead.

A bath-house, which should be
partially serviceable this May,
will be finished, along with a
well drilled nearby to supply
water to the area.

Four Davidsonians Win

nity. Llewellyn plans to do his
graduate work at the University
of Virginia.

Wilson transferred to David-

uate work this fall.

Davidson College President D.
Grier Martin said in announcing
the 1963 Davidson winners, “We
are proud of these Davidson
students and Davidson's ever
growing list of Woodrow Wilson
Fellows. It is our hope that
they will continue as decisively

as possible toward the attain-|

ment of the PhD and that they
will follow a career in college
teaching, for they are not held
to such a committment. They
are only asked to give college
teaching serious consideration

Stitt believes that one solu-
tion for the problem of boring
news is improvement of the
writing capabilities of the re-
porters. To do this, he plans
to set up a system whereby re-
porters would be graded as to
the quality of their stories. The
stories would then be returned
with suggestions for their im-
provement.

After his election, Baum
made this statement to- THE
