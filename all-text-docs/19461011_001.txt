TARGET PRACTICE

T

Upper Classmen Again Assert
Superiority

At 8:30 p. m. Thursday, October
8, 1946, the long arm of the law
extended its forefinger and grimly
beckoned, and ten visibly agitated
freshmen squared their fiery chap-
eaux, tried one final rehearsal of
their pseudo self-confident smirks,
and waited for the opening of the
first session of the 1946 Davidson
Court of Control.

Hizzoner John McAlister, judge
of the truth-seeking, justice-meting
organization, quickly called his five
compatriots to order, and the erst-
while light-hearted, convivial at-
mosphere of Phi Hall was soon re-
placed by a sterner, more powerful
air—an air of grim foreboding for
those who had had the temerity to
break those most sacred and invio-
lable of laws—the freshman regu-

Dramatic Club
Orders Lights

The Red and Black Masquers,
Davidson’s dramatic society, have
ordered a new set of spotlights to
supplement the present lighting
system of the stages in Chambers
auditorium. These lights, located
fin an overhead cradle, will provide
a much better quality of illumina-
tion than the present overhead
lights and consequently will greatly
improve the entire lighting scheme
for dramatic productions. They
will also prove of great value for
eoncerts, recitals, and other per-
formances.

The lights have been bought
with the profit netted from the
Masquers’ spring production, ‘The
Milky “Way,” and will be set up on
the stage by the end of the month.

Tryouts have been held for all
studénts interested in dramatics
during the past week for parts in
the Masquers’ coming production,
and the plans for this year’s work
are well under way.

lations.

Then, 6ne by one, the culprits
were called into the court, charged
with various misdemeanors, given
a chance to plead their cases, and,
after weighty consideration, given
their just deserts. Contrary to the
wishful thinking of various upper-
classmen, none were hung. Instead,
due to the fact that these were first
offenses, they got off fairly éasily.

Tom Swanson, accused of walk-
ing on the grass, was given the
punishment of writing the fresh-
man regulations twenty-five times.

Charles Parker, accused of not
wearing his cap and disrespect to
‘upperclassmen, was campused for
one week and made to copy the
freshman regulations ten times.
Tom Sparrow, guilty of disrespect:
was sentenced to one week of close
association with the D. Bob Wilcox,
the obnoxious and hatless one who
was given two weeks-campus and
further required to make ten copies
of the freshman regulations. John
McCann, who was charged with the
same offenses, received two weeks
compus and ordered to write a
2,500 word theme on college tradi>
tions. Bill Alexander and Bill Rich-
ardson were acquitted on the
grounds that their disturbance at
the Pep meeting was justified. Joe
Crews, charged with disrespect, was
ruled not guilty and given his free-
dom. W. I. Farrior’s sentence for
disreepect was suspended for the
time being, Gould Barrett, on the
same charge, received one week of
campus.

Society Meets

Philanthropic Literary Society
met for the first time this semes-
ter in Phi Hall at nine o’clock, Mon-
day, October 7.

been presented, the lining up of

committees with their duties, ete.—
Ralph C. Clontz presented a plan
for the revitalization of the society
by placing an emphasis on current
issues with especial reference to
topics for national and interna-
tional importance. Clontz said that
he had once witnessed a one-hour
oration on “The Left- Wing of, a
Butterfly.” After the talk he knew
more about the subject than he had
before, but it did not change his
trends of. international thought to
any great degree. It was pointed
out by several other members of
the society that this program
should not be adopted to the ex-
clusion of all others, a point on
which all the Phis were agreed.
Jim Pittman, vice-president of
the society, expressed the opinion
that the interest taken in the dis-
cussion, seemed to forecast a re-

predict an agtive year.

Officers for the present semes-
ter, who were elected last spring,
include Joe Stukes, president; Jim
Pittman, vice-president; Jack
Payne, secretary; and Jerry Robin-
son, treasurer.

Talk Given By
Rev. Wilkinson

Rey. Wilkinson, who-is associate
pastor of the First’ Methodist
church in Charlotte, spoke at the
college chapel service on Thursday,
October 3.

Rev. Wilkinson used a text from
Genesis asthe basis of his talk:
“And Methuselah lived a hundred
eighty and-seven years and begat
Lamech, and Methuselah lived after
he begat Lamech, seven hundred
eighty and two years, and all the
days of Methuselah were nine hun-
dred sixty and nine years, and he
died.” Then Rev, Wilkinson brought
out how life’ should be more than
“just a period between birth and
death. He said we should have a
purpose in life and accomplish that
purpose so that posterity can say
more of us than-He just lived and
died.” Our lives should not be aim-
less or haphazard; but we should
have a goal, and that goal should
have some part in the advancement
of the Kingdom of God.

He compared our life to a river
in saying that a river moves in one
direction and so we must move; the
yiver moves according to certain
universal Jaws and we should ad-
here to God’s laws; a river carries
silt and debris along with it and
our lives should carry the Christian
faith. The talk was flavored with
just enough humor to make it in-
terest-holding and to bring out the
main points in the talk.
