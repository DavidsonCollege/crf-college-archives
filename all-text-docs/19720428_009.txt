Turner: ‘Preachers Are Human, Too

. By BRUCE BECKER
Staff Writer

“Don't forget about the splint-
ers, Brucer.”

Mr. Ray Turner gets a kick
out of how I call sitting on the
bench—'‘collecting splinters in
my ass.” So he always asks me
after every article why there
was nothing im there about the
splinters. I ptomised him it
would be in this one.

Ray Turner is the equipment
manager for the athletic depart-
ment. He does all the washing,
repairing, and issuing for all the
intercollegiate sports.

He is a scrappy, wiry little

man, who looks like he moon-

lights as a gas station manager,
Although he is. meek and un-
pretentious, Mr. T. is the only
member of the Davidson com.
mutrity who is always addressed
as. ‘‘Stud,” pronounced in a
squeal, ‘‘Steeewwwed.”
You'll know he’s heaid you be-
cause he'll go, ‘‘Awwrriiite.”
Mr. Tumer can eat more than
any man his size on campus.
Junior Barker told me he used
to take Mr. T. to fish fries on
Saturday night. ‘‘When Ray
eats, you can forget about just
two. Ray starts on three help-
ings of flounder.”

Mr. Turner is also a free-lance
Baptist preacher. He knows his
stuff, too.

He gets upon the pulpit and
he walks back and forth. He
delivers his sermo like Billy
Graham.

“It's all right if you perspire,”
says Mr. T. “A preacher ought
to sweat if he has to.”

Like all of us, though, Mr.
Turner is a little eccentric.

A few years ago during the
football season a couple bottles
of brown liquid appeared in his
office. Mr. Turner didn’t know
what it was so he polished the
coaches’ shoes with it. The

shine was not too good.

When Coach Couch walked in
he was rubbing like mad. Couch
told him he was using last Sat
urday’s iced tea and Mr. Tur
ner felt a little foolish.

Mr. Turner's vice is women.
A well-built visitor from UNCC
used to use the swimming pool
for safety instruction.

Once, when she walked into
the hall wearing nothing but
her bikini, Mr. T. was casting
appreciative glances.

Distractedly, he said to Junior
Barker, “Junior, did you ever
try to wrap a shoelace around
a pair of watermelons?”

Mr. Tumer used to complain
about his back until last sum
mer when a pretty 16-year old
was too tired to walk up the
xvym stairs. He offered to carry
her up. She accepted. When re-
leased at the top, she smiled
and teased, ‘You dirty ol’ man.”

Mr. T. looked sort of sheep
ish, but like he says, ‘‘Preach-
ers are humans, too.”

There has been a rumor go-
ing around campus that Tom
Scott will retire in the near fu-
ture as director of Davidson ath-
letics. When he does, my vote
for his successor will go to Mr.
Ray Turner.

Our old place gets razed this summer. So
we're getting three new ones. All on
Patterson Court. Each different.

One is a deli grill. It’s gonna serve all
kinds of hot and cold sandwiches. Kosher
style. And in the evenings our deli will
double as a steak house. American style.

Another place will be a cafeteria/snack
