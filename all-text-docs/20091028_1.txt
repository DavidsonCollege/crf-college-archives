VoLumE 101, NUMBER 8

Professor Mark Smith awarded $1 million grant

Locan Lewis
Sports Editor

Davidson College Associate
Professor. of Psychology Mark
Smith received a grant of nearly
one million dollars from the Na-
tional Institute of Drug Abuse to
fuel his study of how exercise may
help overcome cocaine addictions.

Over the last three years, Smith
has performed experiments which
have demonstrated that exercise
can reduce the desire for cocaine.

In one of his experiments, he
tested the motivation of rats to push
a lever to receive a dose of cocaine.
Rats who regularly exercised gave
up when they did not receive a
dose after an average of 70 pushes
whereas those who were not accus-
tomed to exercising kept pushing
the lever an average of 250 times.

The funds he is receiving from
the NIDA will support five years
of animal testing to more precisely
determine the benefits of exercise at
various stages in the addictive pro-
cess. He hopes to answer or to at
least begin to answer difficult ques-
tions as a result of his research.

These questions include the fol-
lowing: Can exercise deter people
from beginning drug use? Will
exercise limit the amount of drugs
new users employ? Can exercise
help people quit using drugs once
they have started? Can exercise
help those who previously used
drugs to avoid a relapse into ad-
diction? Does exercise stimulate
the brain in such a way that physi-
ological changes actually occur
which make a person immune to

drug abuse?

While these are all difficult
questions to answer definitively,
Smith has hope that these funds will
allow him to draw some scientific
conclusions about these topics. The
grant will permit Smith to hire a
full-time research technician, while
Davidson College will provide two
student assistants each summer.

The grant will also cover the
costs of rats and various types of
chambers in which the rats live

Despite a rainy start to the week-
end, Family Weekend 2009 was a
success. On Saturday morning, se-
niors dressed in their gowns, ush-
ered in the new year and celebrated
their achievements during Convo-
cation in Duke Family Performance
Hall. Later in the day, parents and
students enjoyed the football game
versus Drake, a reception for alum-
ni and legacy students and a perfor-
mance in the Union. The Deliliahs,
Shades of Brown Step Team, An-
drogyny, Gamut Dance Company,
Dance Ensemble and the Gener-

als all performed for students and
parents, in a showcase of Davidson
talent. Later that night, families and
students watched the men’s soccer

game against Wofford.

and exercise. The chambers Smith
has been using do not give the rat a
choice between exercising and co-
caine. Dr. David Roberts of Wake
Forest University will work with
Smith to build a new type of cham-
ber which will allow rats to access
both a running wheel and a self-
administration of drugs.

The new chambers will provide
a much more real-world situation in
which the rat will be able to choose
his own path, either to exercise or

drugs. Most addicts have the op-
portunity to choose between exer-
cise and taking drugs. Smith hopes
that when the rats have the choice,
they will choose exercise over self-
administrative drugs.

Smith believes that exercise is
an effective substitute for cocaine
because it acts on the brain in a
very similar way to cocaine. Both
increase concentrations of the neu-

Alumni Association welcomes minority alumni

JESSE JOHNSON

One of the newest efforts the
College is pursuing to diversify
its campus comes from the Da-
vidson College Alumni Associa-
tion (DCAA) with its introduction
Alumni Color Engagement Com-
mittee. Nov. 6-8, the DCAA will
sponsor a weekend of activities in
support of alumni diversity as part
of its ongoing efforts to expand its
family and better serve minority
and international alumni.

“About 10 years ago there was
a summit weekend on campus for
black alumni which was quite suc-
cessful,” Peter Wagner ’92, direc-
tor of Alumni Relations, explained.
“This is the first time since then
that something similar has been
attempted, and the scope this time
around is much broader (we’ve in-
cluded in the invitation list, in the
planning committee, and in the
program itself) alumni from every
ethnicity as well as international
students.”

The project grew out of con-
versations with the Alumni As-
sociation Board of Directors. “We
found that among our alumni, there
is a huge gap between white and
non-white alumni in three easily
quantifiable areas: volunteerism,
attendance at events and participa-
tion in the Annual Fund,” Wagner
explained. “The Board formed the
ACE Committee to address how to
narrow this gap, and the weekend
program is the kickoff event in that
effort.”

The weekend will not only en-
courage minority alumni to partici-
pate in such activities; it will also
allow the College to determine the
reason for the low rates of partici-
pation.

Bill Guidz, director of College
Communications, is also invested
in the event. “As someone who
attended in the 1970s, a lot of us
didn’t feel very welcomed by some
parts of the community, and I sus-
pect some of that continues to a
lesser degree today,” he said.

Rusty Lindsey “76, a member

of the Alumni Association Board
and one of the principal organiz-
ers stated that, “Though Davidson
is continually becoming more di-
verse, it needs to encourage and en-
able input from students and alumni
of color about how it should grow
and evolve to successfully remain
relevant in a changing society.

“This weekend’s activities are
consistent with Davidson Col-
lege’s broader approach to creat-
ing a campus culture that promotes
understanding and acceptance of
diversity in its broadest sense,” he
continued, referencing one of the
four objectives in Davidson’s stra-
tegic plan.

One of the highlights for the up-
coming weekend is a panel discus-
sion featuring alumni across broad
range of eras and demographics,
including: Mitzi Short ’83, Cal-
vin Murphy ’70, Rosie Molinary
96, Izzy Justice "90, Gagan Gupta
707 and Romy Cawood ’89. The
topic is “Davidson Then and Now:
Where We’ve Been and Where
We're Going.” Panelists will share

their stories and provide feedback
to questions and comments.

Wagner strongly encourage:
students to attend Saturday’s panes
discussion, reminding students that
all are welcome (it will take place at
9:30 a.m. in the 900 Room - moved
from Duke)..

“J think it could be a huge learn-
ing opportunity for students who
enjoy a much better experience
today than some of our pioneering
alumni did in the 1960s, 70s and
80s,” Wagner explained.

“Patty Perillo and Ernest Jef-
fries have been primarily respon-
sible for raising awareness of the
weekend among students, and it
does feel like the word has gotten
out and that the buzz is building,”
Wager said. “I hope that we’ll have
strong student participation in the
panel discussion, and that they’ll
reach out to the alumni that will
be returning to campus that week-
end to both honor their experiences
from years before and to educate
them about today’s student experi-
ence.”
