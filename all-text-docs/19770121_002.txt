composed of the NCF director
and assistant director, dean of
students, one faculty member,
one outside member, and three
NC Fellows, operates in a
policy-making capacity.

According to Kello, if in-
coming classes are kept small,
NCF’s funds will be adequate
to help those who need finan-
cial assistance, and greater
individual attention can be
provided to the students.

In discussing the program
as a whole, Kello noted a
recent trend of emphasis on
the summer internship aspect
of NCF to the exclusion of the
program’s other opportuni-
ties.

Kello feels that NCF goes
beyond the opportunities pro-
vided by the Experiential
Learning Office in three ways,
and that interest in NCF
should extend beyond atten-
tion to summer internship
possibilities. :

First, students are given the

chance to “interact with one
another.” Having a lounge in
Philanthropic Hall allows the
students to ‘‘experience one
another in an intensive way.”
NCF mailboxes in the Hall
allow for immediate and con-
stant communication among
students and inter-Fellow
news.

Second, NCF has a ‘“‘struc-
tured speakers program”’ with
outside leaders talking infor-
mally at NCF luncheons.

And third, a student work-
shop is set up with the Center
for Creative Leadership in
Greensboro, providing David-
son NC Fellows the opportuni-
ty to discuss in detail various
aspects of leadership.

Changes in the existing
NCF program being consi-
dered by Kello include the
organization of the luncheon
meetings, with guest speakers
from the faculty, Trustees,
and nearby businessmen, on a
regular basis. Also, Kello

The Davidsonian

would like to have these
“proven quantities’ speak to
campus-wide audiences.

Additionally, Kello wants a
fuller accounting by students
of their summer experiences,
entailing what the internship
involved and an evaluation of
the experience.

But Kello’s major concern is
that the college be ‘‘more
generally informed about what
is going on’’ in the program.
He feels that some sort of a
‘“packet of information’’ of
NCF’s aims, goals, and means
would aid student recommen-
ders in assessing the students’
qualifications. And a ‘“‘short
hand sketch’’ of the program’s
activities, periodically pub-
lished, would make the college
as a whole more aware of the
program and its opportunities

copnd activities.

Senate forms committees

By TRACY UPCHURCH
Staff Writer

In a rather routine meeting,
the Senate thisweekdealt with
committee formation, distribu-
tion of the Senate Handbook
and the date and time for future
meetings.

SGA President Thom Young
wants all the committees to
meet and formulate a long range
goal and several short range
goals. He also wants committee
chairmen to use people outside
of the Senate and to involve
freshmen for their in-put.

The Overcrowding Committee
was singled out for its work in
providing the impetus to open
Rusk House for next year.
Young indicated that the Senate

now considers the House Pat-
terson Court Council’s problem,
and has turned it over to them
for solution.

The senate’s main business
concerned the formulation of
committees. Current SGA com-
mittees and their chairmen are
as follows: Communications—
SGA Vice-president Bruce
Brown; Overcrowding—Lynn

Langley (’79); Community Re-
‘lations— Will Miller (off cam-

pus); Student Interaction—
David Barnard (President —
79); Security—Hans Watford
(Sentelle); and Course Evalu-
ation—Dana English (Little-
Carnegie).

All senators were given a
Senate Handbook which con-

tains the Senate By-laws and
minutes. Further supplements
can be added as the need arises.

Guy DiCenzo (Belk) will co-
ordinate the car pool that
takes students to the Char-
lotte Airport during break.

Finally it was established
that unless otherwise stated,
the Senate will meet each Mon-
day night at 8:30 in’ the
Conference of the the Union.

Outside of the meeting,
Freshman Aida Doss is the only
person to date to show any
interest in taking over the
chancellorship of the SGA. It is
not definately clear if the pres-
ent chancellor, Sam Crawford
will step down from his salaried
position. A decision on this
matter is pending.

committed to their cause. He
said, ‘‘One cannot form a
house on the base of a bunch of
disappointed people who could
not get in through self-selec-
tion. You have to be dedicated
in what you’re doing.”

However, a decision was
tabled because the committee
felt it needed more time and
information. The committee
decided to meet, next Thurs-
day and vote then.
