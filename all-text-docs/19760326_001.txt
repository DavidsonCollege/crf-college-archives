Students eye co-education
merit admission considered

By AMANDA HALL
Asst. Sports Editor

A newly appointed SGA
committee. headed by Ruth
Murphey is evaluating coed-
ucation at Davidson. The stu-
dents tentatively plan to sub-
mit their report to the SGA
April 27 and to the Trustees in
May. me
The committee will base the
study on three major criteria:
Have the goals set by the
original proposal to go coed
been met? Is coeducation wor-
king at an optimum level? And
would accpetance by merit be
beneficial to Davidson?

‘“‘We hope to show that
Davidson needs more women.
Girls are afraid to take a step
and shine out and I think
that’s because they’re so small
in number here,’’ said Mur-
phey.

“But we don’t want it to

they apply to Davidson.
“Cathy hopes to show that
the women at Davidson need
more women. She wants to
compile the parts of her study
and write an attitudinal sum-
mary,’’ said Murphey.
Babette Kissam will com-
pare Davidson to other schools
which have recently gone co-
educational. She will also de-
termine what kind of girls
Davidson accepts or turns
down in light of these schools.
The original committee
looked at Colgate, Dartmouth,
Franklin and Marshall, Ham-
ilton, Kenyon, Boudoin, the
University of the South at
Sewannee and Williams while
developing the proposal, ac-
cording to Murphey.
‘“‘We are going to look back
on these schools to see what
they’ve done with their coed- .

“ucation,’’ she said.

The questionnaire division
will give students, faculty,
and administration question-
naires at random that will
contain questions from all div-
isions of the committee.

Some questions will be fol-
low-up to the original ques-
tionnaires, according to Mur-
phey.

Murphey stressed the im-
portance of prompt, honest
answers from those who re-
ceive questionnaires.

Allison Andrews will send
the alumni different question-
naires. ‘‘It scares me when
we’re mailing them out to the
alumni,” said Murphey. “Who
knows how many we'll get
back.”’

Anne Pelfrey is heading the
publicity division and Craw-
ford Crenshaw is heading the

Basketball coach
search nears end

By BILL BARNES
News Editor

The search for a new basket-
ball coach is nearing comple-
tion, and plans for operation-
alizing an attempt at a return

to national basketball promin-
ence are under way.

Director of Athietics,
Thomas A. Cartmill, cited
three qualities his department
has been searching for in their

look like we are a group with a
formed idea as a group; we
hope to be as unbiased as
possible,’”’ she continued.

“We don’t have a set idea;
each member has their own
ideas,’’ said Murphey.

The committee is following
the same general procedures
as those used by the commit-
tee that originally proposed
coeducation according to Mur-
phey. “They basically broke
themselves down into eight
groups) so we did the same
thing,” she said.

Cathy Landis is heading the
bibliography division, which is
responsible for background re-
search into coeducation. She is
contacting the National Stu-
dent Association and NOW to
request publications on coed-
ucational policy.

Landis is also studying the

hunt for a new head basketball
coach. These include that he
be an ex-head coach, that’ he
have been associated with a
winning program and have
proven his ability, and that he
be able to kecruit.

“I would like someone who
has played the game in a
competitive program, too,”’
said Cartmill.

The new coach’s contract
will probably run for three or
four years, according to
Cartmill. His funding will not
be noticeably greater than
that accorded former head
coach Bo Brickels.

‘‘Basically, the tools we
work with are already on a
nationally competitive scale,”’
said Cartmill.

“The college will not lessen
its support of the program,”
he continued. “If additional
funds are needed, however,

College explores grant for National

By MATTHEW COVINGTON
Editor

College President Samuel R. Spen-
cer Jr. recently told the Davidson
College Board of Visitors that the
current Davidson National Print and
Drawing Competition was ‘‘possibly
the last.” Monday he suggested that
his words be changed to ‘probably
the last.”

“I say ‘probably the last’ because I
would rather be pessimistic at this
point than be optimistic and get
people’s hopes up about the continua-
tion of the National,’’ said Spencer.

Spencer suggests that there is a
double priority involved with preser-
ving’ the National. The competition
needs money to fund itself but also
needs space in which to be shown.
Toward the fulfillment of these needs
the college is actively seeking a

foundation grant.
‘We are currently in the process of

going to a foundation, exploring in
hopes of getting both money to build
and money to continue the show.
Some foundations say ‘No bricks and

mortar—just the program,’ but we ©

are trying for both,’’ said Spencer.
Professor of Art and Director of the
Davidson National Herb Jackson

_agrees with Spencer about the urgent

need for facilities.

“The problem with setting up the
National every years is what to do
with the funds you collect. We’ve
always found some way to raise funds
in the past—the problem has been
facilities ,’’ he said.

If money can be found, according to
Spencer, the National will be contin-
ued as per the suggestions. This
would mean that an assistant would
be hired to help put on the show.

To avoid the possibility of not
being able to run a continuous show,
the college is seeking enough money
to finance the National for three

years. The National costs nearly
$30,000 a year as it is now set up.

Jackson is rather certain that this
is his last year of involvement with
the National. The show catalogue for
this year includes this paragraph:

“The Fifth Davidson National is
my last as director. It has been a
special privilege for me to see some of
the most exciting graphic art in
America come through this gallery
and I am deeply grateful for the
opportunity provided by the trust of
so many willing participants. I will
remember the support of my sponsors
and the kind words from artists.
Thank you for a great pleasure.”

“Tt is important for me now to put
the time and energy I expend on the
National into my work. So as far as
my involvement with the show is
concerned I am finished,” said Jack-
son.

Jackson estimates that anyone who
might succeed him as director of the

National would spend nearly 1000
hours a year on the show. Not all of
these hours are regular, according to
Jackson. Some are spent with the
physical rigors of packing and un-
packing the show while other days
might be spent waiting for a tele-
phone call.

“The job is very uneven, some days
you might do nothing, other days you
might spend 18 hours. How you tell
someone doing this kind of job that he
is part time?’’ asked Jackson. ‘‘It
calls for someone with a philosophical
commitment to get the work done,
not just a commitment to a job. For
anyone to do this job they, would have
to be damn dedicated,’’ he said.

Jackson is unaware that the college
is doing anything to raise funds for
the National or to build an art facility.
He said that the news of this being.
the last year of the National had
shocked the art world. He admitted,
