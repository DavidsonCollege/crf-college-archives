sounded in his cars, “Elijah, what doest
thou here?” That the fear and panic
which had seized the Tishbite had not
entirely abated seems evident from the
response. Read verse 10, He imagined
that all the true worshippers had been
slain and he alone was left.

The Lord dealt gently but firmly |
with the terrified prophet. He is com-|
manded to return to the battle. He was |
told that his terror had blinded him to}

true worshippers for another and migh-|

6. The rebuke which:God administer-
ed to His prophet was none the less im-
pressive because of the softness of the
words in which it was clothed. Elijah
must have been more keenly cut by it}
than if it had been more sternly spoken. |
In it we see the sternness and the gen-|
tleness of God intermingled. It shows}
at once God’s tenderness and His wis-|
dom. The Lord knew that His prophet
had not deliberately run away. He had
been mastered by the passion and fear|
and in its grip was hardly to be ace|
countable, at least fully, for what he had
done,

The psychology of this instance in the
prophet’'s life is interesting. Our lesson
