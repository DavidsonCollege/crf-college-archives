Off The Record

‘Pure Prarie League’ Strikes

Western, Electrical Balance -

By LEE HUDSPETH
Staff Writer

Music today serves various
purposes for different people;
some .use music ‘for
background effect at parties,
others enjoy music only as
something with a beat to dan-
ce to, still others use music to
study by.

Yet some folks listen to their
music selectively, choosing it
on the basis of talent of the
musician(s); the uniqueness
of the sound; the

meaningfulness of the lyrics; :

and most importantly, ac-
cording to exactly what
emotions and thoughts the
musie produces within that in-
dividual.

Ty address this column to
members of the last group,
and.I hope to introduce you to
some’ interesting music,
irregardless of. its age or
popularity.

The sound of ‘Pure Prairie
League,’’ a famous mid-
_ Western group, is of con-
siderable quality and worth
examining. This group ap-
parently no longer records,

and whether it still exists is .

questionable; however, the
League did produce two
_ albums, ‘‘Pure_ Prairie
League” in early 1972, and

‘Bustin’ Out” from June 19 to
August 7, 1972.

The first album, ‘‘Pure
Prairie League’ is a superb
example of such a_ blend,
made up of a foundation of
country style issuing from
some electric components,
subtle hints of an earthier tone
emanating from the synthesis
of the instruments and lyrics
themselves, and a significant
layer of emotional involve-
ment coming fromthe artists’
personalities.

“Tears” is the first song of
eight on this record and serves

as a fine introduction to the.

League’s music. The out-
standing feature of this par-
ticular arrangement is the
fusion of each instrument’s
and vocalist’s. note-line in a
couples: harmonic fashion.

The song begins with both
an electric and sho-boo steel
snagoy load nace wp by
sna lea a
rhythin guitar's light but pun-
ctuated chording, along with a
strong bass and drum beat. As
the lyrics enter the leads
become lighter while ‘the
rhythm guitar’s chording con-
tinues to emphasize - the
flowing yet accented feel of
the entire song.

The lyrics deal with a man’s

sorrow at his lover’s lack of '
understanding and concern
for his lifestyle. Between ver-
ses the steel sho-boo releases a :
lead the theme of which is
freedom, then follows a lead
on the electric guitar ex-
pressing the theme of a man’s
inner fortitude.

The League’s second record .
entitled ‘‘Bustin’ Out”’ is of the
same inestimable quality as
the first, yet only one song out
of all 17-was_ ever--to_my—
knowledge--promoted — by
popular radio; that song being |
‘‘Amie’’ from Side Two.

The lyrics are sung with .
great passion and pertain to a
man who is ‘‘falling in and out
of love’’ with his lover Amie;
he has left the future of their
relationship up to her even
though deep inside he wants to -
stay with her forever.

A Review
By

FRANCIS TOWNSEND

Staff Writer

On the playbill, Viveca Lind-
fors’ performance in “| Ama
Woman’’ is described as ‘‘a
highly theatrical journey, the
story of one woman and all
women,”’

Within the space of twd

hands dance before her ina wo

“IT undertook this work to :

Opening with blasts of music and
turning titles, “Gone with the Wind”’
quickly settles into place as a plod-
ding mock-epic. Dull shots of rivers
and fields and flowers and houses are
meant to evoke the “spirit” of the
South.

The. first dramatic scene is the
worst. Scarlett (Vivian Leigh in a per-
formance worthy of Shirley Temple)
sits on the portico of Tara and flirts
with the Tarleton twins, who dance
about like idiots.

At one time, this scene was
scheduled to be re-shot, which in-
dicates that even Selznick and
Fleming were dissatisfied with it. The
Tarletons inform Scarlett of the ap-
proaching engagement of Melanie
Hamilton to Ashiey Wilkes.

Scarlett utters that -execrable
phrase ‘‘Fiddle-dee-dee’’ and runs off
into the woods-—ignoring the calls of
Mammy, who is_ shouting at her to
treat her guests in a civilized manner-
-where she comes upon her father,
who delivers a lecture on the value of
Tara, —

keeping with the film’s stature as a
mock-epic, we are
and slaves coming in from the fields.

The next day, at the Wilkes’ picnic,
Scarlett is the center of attention for
all the men but Ashley. Her beaus act
like retarded three-year-olds.

tended as serious ornare acting
and completély lacks grace.

Victor Fleming misdirects much of
“Gone with the Wind’’.as though he
were still working on ‘‘The Wizard of
Oz’’. A couple of scenes by George
Cukor offer tantalyzing glimpses of
the film that might have been. The
first of Cukor’s scenes in which Mel-
anie gives birth, is the only scene in
the movie I am able to take seriously.

In this scene,: and in another
somewhat less impressive, one also
directed by Cukor--the one in which
Scarlett shoots the scavenger--Leigh
and Olivia de Havilland (Melanie)
give strong naturalistic _ per-
formances. s
- Usually, Leigh plays for ‘either
comedy or glamour. De Havilland in
many of her other scenes plays the
pure quintessence of Goody-
Goodness--like a skunk, but beautiful.
Even Butterfly McQueen (Prissy)
adds serious dimensions to her per-
formance in the first scene by Cukor.

She enhances rather than con-
tradicts the wonderful comic charac-
terization she creates throughout.
ise worked for months preparing
the film and did three weeks_ of
shooting before he quit and/or was
fired. sa

There were two reasons for his exit.
One was that he didn’t care for the
meddling of David Oliver Selznick,
the producer. Selznick would show up
‘on the set every day with “‘hot’’ ideas
about how the scenes should be §in-

- Cukor held a low opinion of most of
these ideas and was surely in the right
if the rest of the film can be taken. as

reel to reel reviews:

“Gone With The Wind’

_ if Bette Davis had been willi

any indication of the natur@ of these
ideas, e

In some scenes, Vivian Leigh is
reduced to rolling eyes, sticking out
her tongue and pulling pigtails. These
ideas must have come from Selzick or
Fleming, for Leigh is normally a fine,
gracious actress.

‘Rumor has’ it

that Leigh’s

rebelliousness.on the set contributed .

to a nervous breakdown on the part of
Fleming. Good.

Another reason for Cukor’s exit was
the insecurity of Clark Gable. Gable,
who had no illusions about his acting
powers, flatly refused the role of
Rhett Butler when it was first offered
him, but pressure from his fans and
the offer of a large salary eventually
coaxed him to accept. Realizing that
he was a poor actor, Gable insisted
that he have a strong director to help
him.

Curiously, he felt Fleming could
give him this help and Cukor could
not. Either Cukor left or Gable did.

‘Cukor left. Despite being typecast,

Gable delivers a poor performance.
His face is normally an interesting

one, ‘but his Yrimaces make it ugly

and distorted. He never seems to

mean a ‘word he says, and I

sometimes have trouble telling which

of his lines are intentionally ironic and |

which are only accidentally so. 2

Still, he is‘ preferable to. Errol
Flynn, who seemed in line for the part
to act
opposite him. Margaret Mitchell has

suggested Groucho Marx for the par ‘i

which she wrote with him in min
and I tend to agree with her. A Marx
performance might be quite helpful to

« a we er vw et

the film in its present state of fiasco.
It is practically a comedy already.

However, ‘Gone with the Wind’?
does contain a few fine performaces.
‘Laura Hope Keys, as Aunt ‘Pit-
typat,”’ who flusters and blusters and
faints at every breeze, may not exac-
tly act, but is quite funny. Another
fine intentionally comic performance
is thatof McQueen. _-

De Havilland and Leigh, who con-
tinued to rehearse with Cukor on the
sly, give excellent if disunified per-
formances. At her best, Leigh gives
hints of the maturitytocome.

“Gone with the Wind’ has little
unity of any sort. It begins as a
pseudo-epic and ends a grandiose
melodrama. Blithely, it runs through

enotigh material for half a dozen films"

without managing to develop
anything. The film had seven direc-

- tors--sometimes five scenes were

being shot simultaneously on different
sets--and countless writers.

The film is a manufactured item,
and Selznick, who interfered with his
directors practically to the point of
taking over, is a businessman, not an

artist. ‘‘Gone with the Wind’’ should ;

have -been, and doubtless was; in-
tended to be, a romance, a ‘work of
myth and ritual, but it never achieves
this stature.

I’mas big a fool about the Old Cause
as anyone, but when war was
declared and the gallants kissed their
belles and rushed away from the
Wilkes’ picnic to enlist, I could only
shift in my seat and yawn.
