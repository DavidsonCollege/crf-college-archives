hursday night played host
to this year’s installment of

the annual “welcome back”
concert, a burgeoning tradition at
Davidson College. Another related
tradition is that the “welcome back”
concert never fails to start at least
15 minutes late. Anticipating such
a lag, most students strolled. onto
the premises of Richardson Field
towards sundown. The weather was
pristine; sunlight cascaded through
the clouds casting shadows of the
scampering frisbee-ers on the far
end of the lawn.

Gran Torino began playing at
8:15 p.m. to a highly polarized
crowd of nearly 30 people; “There
are hardly any. girls here,” noted
sophomore Steve Johnston. De-
spite the barren crowd, the band
started off quickly and loudly with
a very energetic brand of funk that
transcended both “P” and “G”
varities. ,

Gran Torino, a nine-member
musical ensemble native to Knox-
ville, Tenn., comprises itself of
drums, trombone, saxophone, two
trumpets, several guitars, and vo-
cals.

Near the conclusion of their
first song, the lead singer shouted
something only slightly intelligible
at the audience, but it included the
phrase “Davidson College” and can
be roughly translated, “We're not
gonna keep playing unless you get
up off your rears and dance.”

Catering to their mandate, the
growing swarm of collegians stood
up and leapt about enthusiastically,
injecting some octane into this first

funks up Davidson

campus-wide party of the year.
The band provided both aural
and visual entertainment, as the
brass line variably synchronized the
movement of their instruments, a
common practice of collegiate pep
bands. Their sound and ensemble
were compared to several 70s
groups, including (among others)
the J.B.’s, James Brown’s funk era

backup group. “They remind me of —

Dr. Teeth and the Electric May-
hem,” sophomore Muppet enthusi-

ast Will White said.

By the end of their first hour,
the near end of Richardson Field
was crawling with a sundry assort-
ment of students, recent alumni,
and at least one philosophy profes-
sor. | ,

The most amusing moment of
the concert came when the lead
guitarist very quietly played the
opening line of “Sweet Home Ala-
bama,” causing the students nearest
the stage to leap twice as high into
the air as they had all evening long.
Perhaps a bit nauseated that their
Skynyrd allusion evoked more ex-
citement in the Davidson faithful
than their own repertoire, the lead
singer exclaimed, “You guys are
sick!” (Sister Hazel pulled the same
prank at Davidson last fall.)

Gran Torino diminished the
tempo towards the middle of the
set, as they often do during public
performances.

However, students were both
less enthralled and somewhat con-
fused by their slower stuff.

A few hundred college students
stood bewildered as they attempted
to discern the proper dancing tech-
nique for such moderately tempoed
music.

phone. The band welcomed students back to Davidson for the new academic year

with its performance Thursday night at Richardson Field.

A rendition of the smooth jazz
tune ‘Feels So Good” didn’t actu-
ally feel that good to many in the
restless crowd. “If I were standing
on a ledge, this song would make
me do it,” sophomore Josh Bennett

confessed.

Fortunately Gran Torino picked
up the pace late in thé concert, much
to the relief of the audience, playing
for well over 90 minutes in total.
After the encore, a beeline of stu-

dents headed for the publicity table
to notch a spot on the group’s mail-
ing list, certifying the band’s tri-
umph. The 1997 “welcome back”
soiree was a definite success. Maybe
next year it'll even start on time.

Shine plays to a crowded 900 Room

I was initially skeptical about
going to see the movie Shine. I did
not want to see another low-budget,
“indie” film that poured over sym-

bolism and imagery leaving those
of us who did not choose to major in
English completely helpless. I was
not sure that Shine could ever live
up to its six Oscar nominations, one
for Best Picture, in the 1996 Acad-
emy awards and the heavy praise it
received from legions of critics.
However, after two mesmerizing
hours, I realized that I was convert
to the legions of fans and critics that
praise the remarkable movie Shine.

Shine is the true life story of

Australian pianist David Helfgott,

who begins his study of music in his
early childhood and continues
throughout his

youth.
His talent
quickly sky-

rockets as he
eventually be-
gins participat-
ing in major mu-
sic competi-
tions, in which
nothing short of
a first-place fin-
ish will please
his father.
Director
Scott Hicks
skillfully
chronicles the
life of Helfgott from his early years
as child prodigy, to the brink of his
musical stardom as a young man,

into the depths of madness as an
adult, and to the triumph of his
rediscovery of music as a grown

"man. The structure of the movie

deftly interweaves the past and the
present of Helfgott’s life. One critic

noted that the structure of the movie
resembles that of a piece of music
by slowing down at moments and
then speeding up to a frantic cli-
max. At no time did I find myself
playing with the Indiglo feature on
my watch —a would-be sign that a
movie is too long.

The cast, which includes
Geoffrey Rush, Armin Mueller-
Stahl, and Noah Taylor, is sensa-
tional. Rush gives_a remarkable
performance as the mentally un-
stable adult David Helfgott, deserv-
edly taking home an Oscar for Best
Actor. :

He masterfully captures the
frantic, rattling speech of Helfgott,
his consuming passion for music,
and the great confusion through
which he struggles to find love.

Noah Taylor portrays the ado-
lescent Helfgott with a similar skill,

’ lacing the character with innocence,

desperation, and humor. Also, one
must not forget Armin Mueller-
Stahl who plays Helfgott’s brutal,
overbearing father, Peter.

He comes very close to steal-
ing the entire movie with his com-
plexity; his fierce love and protec-

. tion of David strays into brutality

and extreme overprotection expos-
ing his own failures and his con-
stant need for love. He attempts to
relive his own life through David's
with disastrous consequences.
Enough cannot be said about this
superb cast.

Shine is not just a movie for
people who are interested in music.
It is the remarkable story of the
triumph of human spirit over ex-
treme odds.

For those of you who missed
its two showings at the 900 room, it
is definitely worth a trip to Block-
buster.
