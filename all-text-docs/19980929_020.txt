With 20 seniors on the roster and
15 returning starters, the 1998 Wildcat
football team has been lauded as the
most promising, experienced bunch in
Coach Tim Landis’s six-year tenure as

head coach. In the first half of the

Henry last Saturday, it showed. But,
unfortunately for the ‘Cats, a football
game is sixty minutes long, not thirty.
Fifth-year. senior Tom Dugan
quarterbacked the Wildcat offense to
24 first-half points, while the ‘Cat de-
fense stifled Emory & Henry’s offen-
sive machinery—holding them to only
28 first-quarter yards, and the ‘Cats
jumped out to a 24-6 lead. But, in a
second-half choke that invoked memo-
ries of a certain Oilers vs. Bills 1992
A.F.C. wildcard game, the ‘Cats sur-
rendered their lead in less than thirteen
minutes of third quarter play. A score-
less fourth quarter left over 2,000 fans
heartbroken as the Wildcats suffered
their second loss of the season, and their
eighth consecutive to Emory & Henry.

Emory & Henry entered the foot-
ball game with a perfect 2-0 record, as
the ‘Cats (1-1) came into the game a
week after their first ever overtime vic-
tory, a 16-9 win over the University of
the South.

The ‘Cats’ received the ‘opening
kick for a touchback, and opened with a
consistent, pounding running game led
by Eric Ferguson. Two crucial third-
down conversions sustained the open-
‘ing scoring drive.
The first was a 3rd & 6 pass completed
to freshman standout Mike Tarver.

The second was an impressive run
out of the option by Dugan, who hurdled
his way to a first down: A few plays
later, the right side of the offensive line

(Matt Berry-C, Jamel Wynn-RG, and*

Rowan Driscoll-RT) opened up a huge
hole for Ferguson, who ran the ball
down to the Wasp 11.

The ‘Cats threatened to put the
ball in the end zone, but a holding
penalty set them back to the 11. Kicker
Brian Langley knocked a 28-yard field
goal through the uprights to give
Davidson a 3-0 lead with 8:55 in the
first quarter.

On Emory & Henry’s first possession,
freshman, linebacker Sam Fraundorf
picked up where he left off last week
(when he led the team-in tackles and

blocked a punt for a safety before a
game-sealing fumble recovery in over-
time) with an impressive tackle for a
loss.

Wasp head coach Lou Wacker
tested Davidson’s defensive secondary
early, but outstanding plays by Clif
Henry and Donnie Johnson forced early
incompletions and eventually a punt.

Davidson returned the favor after
failing to convert on a 3rd & 8, but
Jeremiah Parvin delivered a 48-yard
punt with a beautiful roll downto Emory
& Henry’s 14-yard line.

On Emory’s second possession,
Davidson OLB Freeman Belser deliv-
ered a punishing tackle for a loss. Frank
Santore, the radio voice of Davidson
football, praised Belser for, “One of the
hardest hits I have ever seen the ‘Cats
throw.”

Just plays later, a Wasp ball-car-
rier coughed up the football. When the
dust had settled, it was Davidson’s Bo
Henderson that emerged from the pile-
up with his arms around the football.
The ‘Cats took over at Emory & Henry’s
31.

Enter Mike Tarver. The freshman
receiver out of Charlotte’s Harding
University H.S. wowed fans and coaches
alike today with his athleticism and
play-making ability. One reporter in the
press box described him as nothing less
than “a star.” On this possession, Tarver
ran an artful out-and-up pattern with a
spin and out-leapt his defender to bring
down Dugan’s perfectly-placed lob,
putting the ‘Cats in scoring range.

Dugan capped off the drive with a
splendid quarterback sneak for a touch-
down, emerging untouched from the
pocket through a gaping hole created by
the left side of the offensive line.
Davidson 10. Emory & Henry 0. End of
first quarter.

When the Wildcats took over the
ball in the second quarter, an ill-advised
forward pitch from Dugan set Bryan
Kern up to receive a devastating blow
from an Emory linebacker, forcing a
fumble. The Wasp’s Thad Beavers
picked up the football and carried it into
the end-zone for Emory & Henry’s only
touchdown of the first half. Defensive
lineman Tom Ting deflected the PAT
attempt, maintaining Davidson’s four-
point lead.

Dugan showed impressive resil-
iency after the miscue, guiding Davidson
right back down field for yet another
touchdown, capping it off with a 22-
yard dash for a touchdown. Tarver con-
tributed nicely to the effort with a cru-
cial down-field block to allow Dugan to
weave his way through the Wasp de-
fense untouched, Brian Langley, who

has never missed a PAT attempt in his
career, skirted this kick inside the right
up-post to give the ‘Cats a 17-6 lead.

OnEmory’s next possession, Ryan
Crawford picked off a pass from quar-
terback Josh Glaze to regain possession
of the football for Davidson. Thanks to
some outstanding protection delivered
by the ‘Cats offensive linemen, Dugan
completed a key 3rd & 2 conversion to
Tarver, setting up a 14-yard touchdown
pass to Roland Williams. Add the PAT,
and it’s 24-6 Davidson at the half.

One of the big stories for the ‘Cats
in the first half was the impressive con-
tinuing leadership and performance of
fifth-year senior quarterback Tom
Dugan. Dugan is alsoan R.O.T.C. cadet
in the Army’s Davidson Wildcat
Batallion. His instructors praise the de-
meanor and charisma of this young
leader, both as a quarterback and an up-
and-coming officer: “He wants to be an
aviator. With that quiet, calm demeanor,
he’ ll be outstanding,” lauds LTC Mike
Alexander. Captain Bob Geiger adds,
“He’s always willing to learn. He’s the
first to say, ‘I don’t know everything.’
That’s a great thing.” In December,
Dugan will graduate from Davidson
College and earn his commission as a
second lieutenant.

As the Wildcats jogged off the
field at the end of the first half to an
ovation from the home crowd, Emory
& Henry’s defensive coordinator looked
for the baseball cap he had been throw-
ing and stomping on all half.

And then the roof fell in.

The Wildcats committed mistake after
mistake throughout the third quarter.
Dropped punt: 24-12.

Fumble for a safety: 24-14.

A mediocre kick and broken pass cov-
erage: 24-20.

Interception. 27-24.

In less than a quarter, the Wildcats
surrendered their lead, and surrendered
it for good. Thanks in large part to
numerous Davidson turnovers, the
Emory & Henry offensive unit spent
over twelve minutes on the field wear-
ing down the Wildcat defensive team.
Further miscues in the fourth quarter
vanished any hopes of a comeback. A
kickoff-reception carried out of bounds
inside the five. A blown pitch resulting
in a 23-yard loss on a 3rd & short.
And on a crucial fourth-down conver- ©
sion with less than four minutes to goin .
the ballgame. Davidson failed to attain
first down yardage, and turned the ball
over to Emory & Henry for the final
time. The Wasps marched down field,

day night, the University of South Caro-
lina Gamecocks defeated the Wildcats
2-0, scoring in the first and last minutes

During Wednesday’s game,
Gamecock goalkeeper Henry Ring
achieved his fourth shutout this season,
starting in seven games. Concerning
the loss, Davidson head coach Charlie
Slagle commented, “When you play
from behind against a great team like
South Carolina, it’s hard to make up the
difference. “

slowly and methodically, until the game
clock expired.

Radio personality Frank Santore
lamented at the end of the game, “Every
time we play these guys, and every time
we play them close, and every time we
lose, it just hurts a little bit more.”

After the game, a frustrated but
hopeful Tim Landis said, “Let’s call it
like it was: We made too many mistakes
to beat the twelfth-best team in the
nation. We’ ve got to step up and plays
need to be made. We didn’t read the
option as well as we should have in the
second half.”

Despite the fact they have but a 1-
2 record to show for it, the Wildcats
have delivered some impressive perfor-
mances early on in this season. All three
of their games have been decided by
three points or less, and the first-half
performance on Saturday against the
12th-ranked Division III football team
in the nation proved that this Wildcat
team can play with anybody.

Landis and his boys are looking to
bounce back next weekend with a home
game against Guilford College, a team
that is coming off impressive shut-out
defeats of both Methodist and Wash-
ington & Lee.
