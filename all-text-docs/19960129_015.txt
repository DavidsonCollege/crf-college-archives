However the Bucs clawed their
way back, and with 5:4 5 left in the

The Everglades?

Canoeing over X-mas

By Matr Pitzer

Davidson Outdoors continued
a Christmas-break tradition this
year with a pair of long trips to
Florida.

One trip, led by Jonathan
Brooks and Lara Chavis, was a
five-day canoeing trip to the Ever-
glades, while the other, led by
Claudia Lombard and Tom
Robertson, was a similar-length
sailing trip in the Tampa Bay area.

_ The Everglades trip was punc-
tuated by the sight of dolphins
swimming alongside canoes, abald

‘ eagle and other magnificent birds
soaring overhead. The eight-per-
son crew also experienced a peli-
can coming right up to a spot in the
open water where the group spent
the night.

The group left the crowded,
swampy-like portions of the Ever-
glades that most people are famil-
iar with and headed for open Gulf
-water.

There, Brooks said, they spent
some nights in chickees, which are
basically flat platforms raised
above the water.

The groups had no real prob-
lems on the trips, and the Ever-
glades troops actually had little, if

any, trouble with the weather, tra-
ditionally a problematic spot.

“In general, in the Everglades,
the weather changes so much, you
have to be ready to improvise. The
tides come in and out and the river
flows different directions. This is
the first trip with no problems,”
Brooks said. "The highlight of the
trip is coming into the open water.
It is just absolutely beautiful.”

two foul shots, and the Bucs took a
70-69 lead, but the Wildcat de-
fense did not yield another point.
Davidson forced the Bucs’ to
take low-percentage, difficult shots
down the stretch, and despite shoot-
ing 66% as a team from the line,
Monica Winter gave Davidson
some clutch free throws down the
stretch.
Elizabeth DuBose iced the
game for the Wildcats, draining
two from the line, giving the team

the 75-70 win.

Although Head Coach John
Filar cites several reasons for the
Wildcat success this season, he
says the team’s intensity tops the
list.

“I’m just so impressed with
the way our team has come in and
played the difficult Southern Con-
ference teams this year. The game
tonight, for example, (the ETSU
game) we could have lost this type
of game last season. But this team

has intensity. They have no fear,”
he said.

Filar said this was his most
talented team ever, and if they im-
prove on the defensive boards their
potential is great. However, he is
unwilling to look too far ahead,
saying the Wildcats are taking this
year one game at a time.

The Wildcats play at Marshall
on Monday, and they will return to
Belk Arena on Saturday to play
Furman at two,

The Davidson swimming team
suffered a tough defeat to the Duke
Blue Devils (139.5-97.5 for the
men, and 158-68 for the women)
last Wednesday in the Wildcats’
final home dual meet of the season.

Despite the outcome, there
were many bright spots for the
Wildcats. Freshman Alison
Hobgood broke the school record
in the 200 meter backstroke with a
time of 2:11:40, and freshman
Kathleen Paffenroth set the school
record in the 200 meter butterfly
with a time of 2:09:96.

During the previous meet,

Paffenroth demolished the school —

record for the 1650 meter freestyle

by 54 seconds and was named Ath- _

lete of the Week. Churchill Hooff,
who won all three of his events,
continued to swim well.

The seniors, consisting of
Corey Bean, Hooff, John Rogers,
Mike Rogerson, Rion Smith,

Katharine Welling, Meg Bentley, .}

and assistant coach William Rob-
ert were honored before the meet
for all their hard work over the past
four years.

Duke, however, has a strong
program and they just outmanned
the Wildcats.

“Tt was a tough loss... but it
