MEET THE CANDIDATES

SCA President
ERIC ROSENBACH

B.J. RUDELL

Junior Political Science Major

What has been your most significant
contribution té SGA or the Davidson
community? ‘
“As far as SGA, freshman and sopho-
more year, I was class president so in terms
of leadership, I think my first year anda half
here, since I went abroad the second half of
my sophomore year, I contributed good
leadership. That entails everything from
good representation of my classmates to
contributing to things like the Student Con-

Dean Terry but it’s a job that needs to be
done. I think that’s a significant contribu-
tion to Davidson.”

In your opinion, what were the SGA’s
most important accomplishments of
1993?

“T have a lot of respect for the things
that Alden has done. I think a lot of the
things he did took courage because they
were things that hadn’t really been thought

What has been your most significant
contribution to the SGA or the Davidson
community?

“There is no one significant contribu-
tion that I have tried to make. I don’t
believe, and I’ve never believed, in trying
to create the perfect society in Davidson,
in trying to establish something so far-
reaching that it will affect so many people
because many of those people affected
may not like it. So I try to reach those
people who have

clear that the student government as a whole
and asa majority took the side of feeling that
the Statement of Purpose is obsolete and that
it needed to be changed to coincide with
student life and what was expected of a
student. Obviously those two issues espe-
cially stick out. I’ve been happy to be a part
of it.”

With that in mind, how can Davidson

Current activities or commitments: Dean

Dean Rusk Student Advisory Council
President, Big Brother, Hall Counselor
Major campus concerns: “The Trustee
Complex,” social options, student-faculty
relationships . . .

Post-Davidson aspirations: Foreign Ser-

Campaign promises: to push the current
reforms into reality (Statement of Purpose,
etc.)--to nurture a better trustee vs. stu-
dent-faculty relationship (I have reform
ideas)--strong push and advocate for new
union--develop the new Dean of Students

_as a strong advocate--stand my ground on

issues that are important to the student
body

The Statement of
Purpose was a very
good accomplish-
ment, although it’s
not been completed
yet, Alden’s
brought things upto
the front so where
they’re now being
examined and it
looks as though
things like that will
continue. The state-
ment that all mem-
bers of the Trustees
have to be active
members of the

Christian church, .

that just doesn’t
speak, in my opin-
ion, very well of the

that back, when
the benches were

that individually
taken may not
seem like great
contributions, but
when taken as a
whole, I feel I’ve

Major campus concerns: More respect
from administrators, infirmary, school cal-
ender, Baker sports

Post-Davidson aspirations: Devoting my-
self to public service

Campaign promises: There is no grand
plan I wish to thrust upon the students of this
school, no all-encompassing agenda that will
right every wrong or bring unprecedented
peace and harmony to this campus. No one
is so naive as to think this is possible. I'can
only pledge to do nothing more than work

as I have done for the past two-and-a-half :

years. There is no greater promise I can
make.

more progres-
sive or tolerant?

“I think there is
definitely a way
to do both. What
you have to look
atis the many dif-
ferent students on
campus—many
of whom are
Christian, many
of whomare non-
Christian. Just
because there isa
division between
the two groups,
does not mean
that we have to
choose one path.

$100,000--some-
thing like that. That was for two different
years. That was a significant contribution I
would think.

 “Tothe Davidson community I’ve done
community service—Habitat for Human-
ity, I’ve gone some Saturdays with my
house. I’ve been the community service
coordinator for PiKA for the last year and
we’ve done a lot of different things that I
don’t think my fraternity’ s ever done be-
fore at all—as far as raising money for the
Arosa House and also for Habitat for Hu-
manity. Like I said, I’m a big brother so
that’s a more individual affect on the
Davidson community.

“Also for the Davidson community
this year I’m on the Dean of Students Search
Committee so I’ve been going through the
x number of applicants that we’ve had this
far and looking for a person that I think will
be able to do a good job as the next dean of
students. It’s a very difficult job to replace

that is trying to get
rid of exclusiveness because that seems to
be a very exclusive statement. That is a
very big thing.

“More than anything I think the 1993
year SGA president and the SGA did a good
job of representing the student view in
circumstances where it may have been
tough. At other times, I don’t think the
SGA has always actually demonstrated the
student point of view. I think this year it
was very evident that that was the case.”

How can Davidson reconcile its histori-
cal connection to the Christian tradition
and its current ambition to be more pro-
gressive and tolerant?

“T actually don’t think this is a very big
problem because although Davidson has a
very strong Christian tradition, it can still
have that Christian tradition while being

people come to me with a complaint, I’d
like to think that I go out and make sure that
that complaint is heard by the people who
need to hear it.”

In your opinion, what were SGA’s most
important accomplishments in 1993?
“We’ve tackled a lot of tough issues
this year: Statement of purpose, and the
make-up of the Trustees. I think that Alden
did a very good job in establishing what he
wanted to do with student government. I
feel the majority of the student govern-
ment supported the changes in the State-
ment of Purpose and the Trustee make-up
to make it more diverse, and more appeal-
ing, and more embracing of the people on
campus. This campus is not what it was 20
years ago, and the faculty are not what they
were 20 years ago, and the Trustees are the
only ones still seem to lie behind in that

it, keeps the
school bounded in the Christian tradition on
which it was founded. There is no reason to
remove any memory of that fact, because
that would almost show our embarrassment
of being founded on such a tradition and I
don’t think that is right. Being non-reli-
gious, I really have to take a very impartial
view and say that while I am very much for
diversity and I am very much for making
this school more progressive in its thought,
there are many students who obviously don’t
feel the same way. I’m not ready at all to
instill my moral beliefs on other people and
force them to believe as I believe. I think
that as a president, it is important to be a
figurehead for the students and not just take
my own beliefs into account. Although in
some areas they will be taken into account
but in the question of religion and morality
and what’s right and what’s wrong, what
