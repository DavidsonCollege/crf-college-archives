Tankers Working Hard for First Meet

With State J.V's in Local Pool Feb.17

By WOODY McKAY

Beginning with the bare essen-
tials, and we do mean “bare’’, Coach
Dick Redding has undertaken the
task of building a team of ample
amphibians to comprise Davidson's
first varsity swimming team.

Although the first couple of days
found a large influx of possible
candidates, this group slowly but
surely waded itself out and Ieft a
determined few around which to
build some Davidson ducks. Since
that time, endurance and form has
been the nucleus around which the
team has been working so as to
improve form for more speed and
for better time in distant. swim-
ming. Many of those out are swim-
ming as much as two and a half
to three miles a day,

The largest group of swimmers
is the sprinter class. Bill Ray and
Aubrey Miree show the best pros-
pects up to this time, but some oth-
ers are giving them good competi-
tion. The races in this class are
of 50 and 100 yard lengths with a
free style stroke. This calls for
strong arms and smooth swimming,
and such boys as the two already
mentioned along with Fred Spach.
Hugh Evans, Ken Taylor, Gray
Hampton, and Francis Pepper are
working hard to bring down their
time,

The 220 yard breaststrcke group
have worked hard and regularly,
and show results by the speed they

have picked up since beginning |

practice. George Cornelson and Ray
Cunningham are running close for
best time in this group, and they
are almost ready for competition.

The longer free style distances,
220 and 440 yard lengths, are begin-

ning to cut down on their time al-
so. John Jervis, Bill King, Dick
Gilchrist, "and Paul Cole are the
workers ont for this class. These
boys seem. to be improving suf-
ficiently for the short time they
have been working, and should give
some good competition in coming
seasons.

The boy nearest to competition
time, Bob Long, shows a great deal
of promise; however, he is the on-
ly senior on the squad and will be
with the team only for the present
season. George Knight and Dan
Heiser are also out for this group
of backstroke competitors for 150
yard races, and, being freshman,
should du a lot of swimming during
their college days.

All of these boys are working
hard each day, but a team can’t be
topnotch during its first season.
It’s going to take a year or
to mold out a good bunch of swim-
ming competitors, but it is getting
off to a good start.

The team is planning to meet N.

C. State at Davidson on Friday,
February 17, Dates may be per-

Improved Grapplers
Drop Two Close Ones

By BILL ADAMS

The Davidson wrestling team
took the sports spotlight during
the past week with two home ap-
pearances against conference foes.
Saturday the matters lost a tough
17-11 decision to N. C. State and
Wednesday they again went down
to defeat before the UNC grapp-
lers by a score of 18-11.

In the State match, the Cats
‘came very close to a win. “Going in-
to the last match Davidson necded
a decision for a tie and a pin to
win, but footballer Charlie Musser
of State proved just a little too
much for Bull Alexander and won
the decision over Charley Park-
er's pride.

“In the first match Jenkins (S)
decisioned Dan Bell but Johnny
Kelton pinned Buie (S) in the
next to give Davidson a 5-3 lead.
Shorty Lafar and Arnie Cavell lost
decisions to Rudolph (S) and
Martin (S) and Poklin (S) pinned
Hal Haynes to put the Cats he-
hind 5-14. But the tide changed as
Mott Price and Bob Gay both took
decisions to set the stage for the
last match and climax-ending.

North Carolina’s Tarheels came
here Wednesday boasting a better
won-lost record than the Cats and
also two conference champions
which made they heavy favorites.
But the Wildcat grapplers scem to
be improving with each match and
gave the cacky Tarheels quite a
battle before falling.

The first match was very even,
though just a little slow, and end-
ed in a draw between Sam Bell

TS

mitted too, since the swimmers are
going to be different and wear
swimming trunks. The . Wildcat
team _ will oppose State at Ralcigh
‘on February 24, and ‘plan to meet
Clemson on March 13.

The team will do its best, but
they will be against experienced
competition, so they may not take
all the first places; however, as any
new team, they need the ‘support
of the student body. Jet them know
that swimming at Davidson is off
to a good start.

final quarter.

ble in downing the Campus Club
by the score of 32-20. The KA’s
took a lead they never lost when
Bill Adams hit for the game's first
basket. It was 14-9 at the half as
both team’s substituted freely. High
seorer for the evening was Adams

with 9, closely followed by Team-

mate McWilliams’ 7, and the same
number of Campus Clubber Live

Kappa Sigs 48; Phi Gams 39

high flying Kappa Sigs put down
a fighting Phi Gam outfit by a
48-39 score, Sig Al Fitzgerald con-
tinued his high scoring by dump-

ing in 12 points, high for the con-:

teSt. Redman {Crosland helped a
winning cause with 9 points, Phi

Cagers Find Going
Rough in Charleston

By J. V. HOWELL

Citadel's Bulldogs took an early
lead and held off a spirited bid by
Davidson in the closing minutes to
win a 41-34 Southern Conference
basketball victory February 3.

It was a tight defensive battle
from beginning to end and both
teams missed a large percentage of

their shots from the floor. Citadel's:

ability -to score from the foul line
proved the difference.

Citadel’s Chester Szymaneki ted
all scoring with 17 points. Captain
Whit Cobb and Fred. Hengeveld

led the Davidson seoring .with 8.

each.

and Randleman. Johnny Kelton and
Shorty Lefar both took decisions
for the Cats to give them an ear-
ly lead but Arnie Covell and Hal
Haynes were both pinned. Haynes
was pinned by Kemp, who was one
of Carolina’s Conference champs
and probably their best all around
wrestler, Mott Price who just
missed pinning his man, lost a very
close decision by time. Bull Alexan-
der lost to Gupton by time, too
Gupten was Carolina’s other Con-
ference champ. In the last match,
big Bill }tcNeely won a close de-
cision over Augustine in the last
30 seconds as he rallied to come
from behind. This last match was
the day’s best and really gave the
crowd plenty to yell about in spite
of the team loss.
