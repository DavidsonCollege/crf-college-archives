New sports courts may
be named for students

By Mary Laura Moretz

The idea to name the remain-
ing nameless apartment buildings
after senior raffle winners failed,
but a similar proposal has taken its
place. Senior Class President B. J.
Rudell and Director of the Cam-
paign Jamie May hope to imple-
ment the raffle plan instead with

the new sports courts to be built:

behind Martin Court Building F.

Rudell and May reached this
compromise after discussing. the
issue last week. May explains:
“Finding donors for these build-
ings is one of the highest priorities
of the campaign right now. The
sports court area is a better idea
because it’s not something that we
would ordinarily seek donor sup-
port for.”

_ Rudell says, “I understand
exactly what he’s saying. It could
also look a little frivolous to name
a building after a random senior
when we place such importance on
the gifts from our bigger donors.”

Hoping for the cooperation of
the Physical Plant, Rudell suggests
placing a small sign by the court

area with the name of the senior
who wins the raffle and the amount
of money raised for charity by the
event. Each senior class, Rudell
explains, could hold a similar con-
test so that the fundraiser would
become an annual event. The sign
would.be repainted every year. _

“We hope to have found do-
nors for the apartment buildings in
the next several months before the
Campaign comes to an end,” May
says, “but this is a perfect solution.
It’s wonderful that the students are
motivated to accomplish some-
thing this good for class philan-
thropy.”

Rudell hopes that the combi-
nation of the enthusiasm for the
raffle and the need for the new
courts will make both projects pro-
ceed faster. He says, “I think these
ideas can work in tandem to en-
courage each other.”
