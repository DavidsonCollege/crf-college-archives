IdnEgo-relationship advice for friends and
family, foes and lovers

IdnEgo are Freud’s psychoanalytic voices
that influence all relationship decisions. Id, who
represents the unconscious and licentiousness in
all of us, rarely agrees with Ego, who touts the
conscious and morally-aware course of action.
Tune in each week to hear them face off against
each other as they analyze your relationship and
provide counsel.

Want to hear what IdnEgo have to say about
your relationship dilemma? Or have any com-
ments about their advice? Send your questions

Dear IdnEgo,

[love my best friend to death, but she has one
habit that’s driving me crazy. A lot of times when
we do anything that involves paying for some-
thing, she forgets her wallet or comes up short.
Most of the time it’s little stuff like a cup of coffee
or bagel, but sometimes she “needs” $20 to buy a
CD that she “just has to have.” I don’t mind
“lending” her money from time to time, but it’s
happening more, often and she always seems to
forget the. paying me back part. When I ask her
about the money she acts as if I’m being cheap!
How can I get my money back without ruining the
relationship?

Going Broke.

Dear “Going Broke,”

Look, your “friend” is an irresponsible, nar-
cissistic, egocentric, manipulating, cheapskate,
skinflint. Trust me, Id has been one himself for

years. Now listen up - this is how you deal with
your “friend”. Make up a bill of what she owes -
add a couple bucks for your troubles and suffering
that she has caused - present her with the bill and
tell her to pay up. If she says no - take her stereo (or
CD collection which you have apparently been
paying for) and tell her she can come by and pick
them up when she drops off the check - for every
day she is late add $5.00 to the bill. Honestly, you
don’t need friends like this - she’s using you -
either figure out how you can use her or move on.
In your best interest, Id

Dear “Going Broke”,

You seem to have overlooked the simple
two-letter solution: NO. Get to know this word.
Practice saying it a lot so the next time your friend
hits you up for money, you are ready to spit it out.
And don’t practice it the same way every time-

_ MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 1999 13

you'd be amazed at how much emotion these two
letters can express. (For example, Ego has found
the brusque guttural low NO a great way to expres-
sive displeasure.) But probably the most effective
NO for your situation is a plaintive, embarrassed,
hesitant, and slightly nervous one. Not only does
it show concern for your friendship, it saves you
money at the same time! What more could you
want? For added drama, preface it with a quizzical
look and a long “um” so she knows you’ re really
thinking about it. If you think you might crack
under the pressure, make up some cue cards and
carry them with you in case of emergency. As for
the money she owes you? How much is a good
friendship worth these days anyway? Five, six
hundred bucks? Sounds like you’re getting a
bargain.

Your friend, Ego

P.S. Your friend Ego had a rough week!
