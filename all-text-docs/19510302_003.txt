Into the embarras-
sing emptiness which
stands behind the door
marked “Prophy
Room’’ in Johnston
Gym ‘went a new fix-
ture this past week,
symbol of the second
Southern Conference
championship for Da-
vidson in as many
years, and third in her
history.

Ere long, a photo
of Bill Ray and Coach
Redding holding the
loving eup for the win-
ner of the Southern

Conference 50-yard freestyle championship will be hung be-
side the pictures of Bo Roddey and Whit Cobb, of late tennis
players of some note, and that’ll be the celebration for our

titlist.

Unfortunately, the Otts Lecture series cancelled all an-
nouncements so they were knocked out of chapel plaudits. And
the meet was in Raleigh, not on the Davidson campus as was
tennis last spring, so the enthusiasm for his victory was at no
fever pitch. But the championship stands every bit as genuine.

And the champion is every bit genuine, too. For a man
who turned in the fastest time in the Southern Conference
all winter long in the 50, beating in final competition the only
man to lick him all year long, Blue Ray is as tight-lipped
modest as ne would be with his head under water. Believe me,

he’s a team captain.

What about his swimming background? Being from Silver
Springs with his folks running that resort, one figures Blue
started pretty early. ‘‘I just started early. That’s about all, I

guess,’’ he hastily. recalled and hurried on to:

‘I wish the

team could get the praise it’s due. Boy, Pepper and Cunning-
ham really did great at Raleigh. And our freshmen did, too.

“You know, Ray was sick up there. He still had a deep
cough and cold, but he placed first in the medalist division of
the 100-yard breaststroke. Yeah, the medalist division is com-

prised of the second -best five

men, in other words the sixth

through tenth finishers. But Ray would have been even higher

had he been in good shape.

‘‘Pepper was fourth in the 1500 meters, first time he’d
swum it this winter, and he placed in the medalist of the 220
‘and 440. You couldn’t enter but three events, and Pepper
placed in every one of his. Our freshmen, Gary and Stuart
placed in medalist of the 100. In fact Ed got first in the fresh-

man medalist.

“Now here’s something you'll like. You know,

Francis

would have done a darned lot better in the 440 and 220 if he
hadn’t swum that 1500 first. That’s 65 laps and really a pull.
He said he just kept singing ‘Onward, Christian Soldiers!’

over and over in his mind until

he got through. Man, you need

something like that to pull you through that long grind.

“And Coach Redding really deserves some credit. He was
busy with football at the kame time, you know, and a. lot of
times he would come down at night to help us. I wish he’d
gotten more credit for his work with us. He really did a good

job.

Indeed IMr. Redding did do a good job—a great one. One
title and six other odd medals the first real year of varsity
competition is no little accomplishment. And don’t let anyone

tell you it was all his material.

“My first championship?” Blue repeated, “Why, this one.

It’s the first time I’ve ever

swum in competition.’’
As simple as that. Bill Ray has been swimming about as

long as he can remember. He worked for his folks at Silver
Springs, sometimes as a lifeguard, sometimes diving under
water ‘‘when people just wanted to take pictures of some-
body underwater,” and later teaching lifesaving. Just a sport
for relaxation or a trade to help run the resort. No thought

of competition at that stage.

That’s why the good-looking

black-haired boy with the V-shaped torso is so inwardly happy
over the title. It’s mighty good to know that what you’ve been
doing naturally, aided by the right coaching, can beat the best
of those who have been working under time piece and gun

smee high school days.

Bill’s winning time at Raleigh was 24.7, four-tenths slower
than his 24.38 Davidson pool record of three days earlier, and
and three-tenths above his Southern Conference trials time. of
24.4, which was incidentally the fastest time of any heat all

day. Coasting through with a

24.9 in the semi’s, Blue would

have undoubtedly bettered 24.7 in the finals, but caught his

arm on the lane rope. “Shoot,

I was lucky to win that one.

Just hit my turn right, and I'd gotten a good start. That’s

about all.’’

Pretty fair formula, isn’t it, for a Southern Conference

crown?

Undefeated Record
For Victors Rarity

In Inter-Frat Play

By WALLACE ABBOTT

With still one week remaining to
play in the basketball league we
find that this year's loop champ-
ion has already been decided. For
the Sigma Chis have won their
first Intramural Basketball champ-
ionship. This is quite a feat for that
fraternity for they have only re-
cently entered into intramural com-
petition here at Davidson. This feat
is doubly interesting for they have
gone through the season undefeat-
ed and that is something that has
not been done in this league in the
past few years.

The Sigma Chis sewed up the
league championship this past week
as they defeated their only remain.

The game was nip and tuck
throughout, but the Sigma Chis
put on a closing burst of accuracy
to win. Dorsey Pleasants was high
point man for the Sigma Chis and
Sloan and Spach led for the Kappa

Although the Phi Delts made
a close game of it throughout they
still were no match for the KA's,

led the Phi Delts with 8 points and
Knott and McWilliams led the KA’s
with 10 apiece.

Thad Monroe's 15 points were
enough to lead his team to a vic-

Track Schedule Hit
By 3 Cancellations
Bu Adds FSU, Emory

By DICK ROPER

A dozen lettermen plus a prom-
ising frosh crop and other reserve
talent from last year’s track team
which won five and lost two meets
will give Coach Heath Whittle am-
ple material to weld into his 1951
track team. Having worked out
for several weeks already, the
cinder club faces many more days
of stiff work before their first
meet sometime in April.

Actually, Coach Whittle doesn’t
know exactly when the first meet
will be held. Furman was carded
to open the season on April 1, but
had to be erased when the Presby.
terian and Baptist spring holidays
interfered, Furman not returning to
the campus until the day of the
scheduled meet. South Carolina,
to whom the Cats were to have
been hosts on the 7th, and the Cita-
del, an April 21 foe in Charleston,
have withdrawn becarse of inabili-
ty to field a team tiis spring.

Washington and Lee is scheduled
to come to Davidson on April 28,
but Coach Whittle says that he

Carolinas’ Mat Meet!
Opens Here Friday,
14 Teams Invited

A unique sports event is in store
for Davidson College and the vi-
cinity on the weekend of March
9th and 10th when teams and in-
dividuals from all over the two Ca-
rolina’s meet to vie for the Ca-
rolina’s A A. U. Championships
in wrestling.

Athletic Director Scott, who is
the Carolina’s committee chairman
for this event announced this week
that Davidson had heen awarded
this tournament and that several
dozen schools, clubs, and service
teams had already been invited to
participate in the tournament.

So far only two teams have def-
initely accepted to compete. The
tough Camp Lejune Marines and
Coach Charlie Varker’s Wildcat
grapplers were the carly entrants
as complete teams, but Coach
Scott is sure that at least five or
six teams including some entrants
from the University of North Caro.
lina and the entire team from Appa-
lachian State Teachers. It is in-
teresting to note that the Apps
have a widely known wrestling
team as to their interest and Jong
winning streak, and that they arc
the defending champions of this
tourney. All indications are that
they stack up to past years, having
again copped the North State Con-
ference title.

Other teams invited are the
high school teams from States-
ville and High Point; service
teams from Parris Island, U.
S. Mine Forces and U. S. Naval
District teams from Charles.
ton, and Cherry Point; and the
collegiate teams of Citadel,
Duke, and Western Carolina.
The Y. M. C. A. team from
High Point also has been in-
vited.

Depending upon the number of
entries, the bouts will start either
Friday afternoon or night. They
will continue on until Saturday af-
ternoon when the champions are
declared. The contestants will be
seeded and paired according to
past performance, making sure the
two best are arranged so as not
to meet in the earlier bouts.

Medals will be awarded to the
first, second, third, and fourth man
in each class, and in addition tro-
phies will be presented to the first
and runner up teams. Also to the
most.outstanding wrestler of these
two top teams goes a trophy. As
an added attraction, a man gets a

‘trophy for the quickest fall he can

maneuver. Consolation bouts are
arranged for the boys who meet
the first and second man in each
weight.

This tournament is A. A. U.
sanctioned and run. The rules
will be those of the A. A. U.
which differ somewhat from the
usual collegiate rules. They
tend to make the game tough-
er and more wide,open and
nearer like the Olympic style.
At least 6 or 8 teams are ex-

pected to meet in Johnston Gym
to compete for these championships
and so a lot of good wrestling will
be on tap for the Davidsonians and
vicinity. The service teams and the
defending champions from Boone
should add somewhat to this at-
traction and should display some
good hard tactics on the mat.

Lee, one of the two teams to beat
Davidson last spring, may not field
a club on the cinders.

As it looks now, Wake Forest,
moved from a mid-week date of
April 18, will probably open the
Davidson schedule on April 7 now.
A triangular affair with Florida
Sfte and Emory in Tallahassee
fills the Citadel cancellation on
April 21. Meets with Mercer and
Clemson remain unchanged. Coach
Whittle is attempting to schedule
Richmond for the finale May 12.
He also hopes to be able to send
a small contingent to the Carolina
Relays on April 7, the same day of
the Wake Forest meet.

CAPTAIN CATFISH

Swimmers Grab One Conference Title, Five Medals

At 8.C. Meet; Pepper and Taylor

By CHARLIE HASSELL

For a team that won only three
out of ten meets for the season,
the Davidson swim team brought
home more than its share of
trophies and medals from the
Southern Conference meet in
Raleigh last weekend.

Standout for the team was
Captain Bill Ray, who copped the
50.yard dash crown, touching the
finish line about one second
ahead of V.M.I’s Dick Tafner.
His winning time was 24.7 sec-
onds, but his qualifying time was
24.4—far better than any other
time turned in at the meet. For
winning the championship, Ray
gets the large Emil Hilker tro-
phy, which is rotated to the win-
ning school each year and pre.
sented annually by Bill Ward,
an ex.State sprinter. He. also
gets a miniature of the trophy

for himself and a conference tro.
phy for the win.

Francis Pepper received three
medals for placing in the medal-
ist division. He swam the 1500
meter (65.6 lengths) swim in
22:27, which brought him fourth
place in that event. He also got
second place in the 440 yard med-
alist race, and third in the 220
medalist.

Ray Cunningham was hamp-
ered by recont illness, but never.
theless managed to wind up first
in the medalist class with a time
of 1:09.1. This was .7 seconds
better than the last place in the
trophy division. and had his qual-
ifying time been good enough to
place him in the trophy division,
Davidson might hz. had two
new trophies instcad of the one.

Campus Interviews on Cigarette Tests } |
Number 14...THE BEAVER

“How eager

E once in his life, our fervent friend admits that
eagerness can be over-done! He’s alluding, of course, to all
these quick-trick cigarette tests—the ones that ask you to decide on cigarette
mildness after just one puff, one sniff, one inhale or one exhale! When the
chips are down, he realizes cigarette mildness can’t
be judged in a hurry. That’s why he made...
The sensible test .. . the 30-Day Camel Mildness Test
which asks you to try Camels as your steady smoke—
on a pack after pack, day after day basis. No snap
judgments needed. After you’ve enjoyed Camels—and only
