THE SPORTS

PARADE

WILDCAT TRACKMEN
OPEN WITH FURMAN

First honors in winter sports were fairly
well divided among members of the South-
ern Conference, as a result of the meets
and tournaments held during the past week.
Only one school, Virginia, emerged victor
in more than one particular sport. The bas-
ketball crown went to South-Carolina Uni-
versity; boxing and swimming honors were
taken by Virginia; wrestling by Washington
and Lee, and indoor track by Duke Uni-
versity.

With the good»showing of football candi-
dates in the final game of winter practice,
Coaches Newton and McEver feel pretty
good about the possibilities of the Wildcats
next season: Despite the loss of Pearce,
Captain Gardner, Peabody, Mills, Fleagle,
Flinn, Wagner, Whitfield, Ogden, and Can-
non, the coaches feel that Davidson-will be
represented by a better team this fall. All
the Sophomores who won regular berths last
fall have seasoned quite a bit and should
go even better when the curtain goes up
next September. Eb Willson, who won an
all-state berth last season, has shown a
great deal-of improvement in the winter
practices_and if he continues.to_pick up, he
should prove to be the spark-plug of the
Davidson attack next fall.

Among those who showed promise in the
winter practices are included: Morgan, Mor-
ris, Mackorell, Willson, Hutchins, Hand,
Wingfield, and Potter, lettermen; Grant,
Ross, Craven, Sievers, Lee, Batte, Bumgar-
ner, and LeGear, members of last year’s
squad;-and Captain Cathey, Windham, Lee,
Cumbie, Murray, Pittman, Verble, Yarbor-
ough, and Burns, of this year’s Freshman
team.

From the showing of individual members
of the Freshman track team in the indoor
meet at Chapel Hill last Saturday night,
indications’ point to a successful season for
the yearlings. Ras Evans, running for Da-
vidson in the 60-yard dash, set a new rec-
ord in the Freshman division by clipping
one-tenth of a second off the former mark
of 6.6 seconds. Merchant, representing Da-
vidson in the three-quarter-mile run, came
in fourth to give the Wildcats another point
and win third place in the Freshman divi-
sion of the meet.

DID YOU KNOW THAT:

Earle Frazier, a member of the yearling
cross-country team last fall, is considered
by Davidson coaches as one of the best dis-
tance running prospects they have ever seen
. . . He holds the state high school record
in the mile run. ... Ras Evans should fill
Fred Fleagle’s shoes in the dashes next
year. ... Four regulars on the basketball
team will graduate this spring. . . . They
are Captain Bruce Peabody, Fred Dickerson,
Jack Wagner and Harry Boucher. . . . Wash-
ington and Lee won four firsts and two sec-
onds in the Southern Conference wrestling
meet at Lexington, Va., last week.

Captain Bradsher Is
Hurt While Practicing

Captain Earle Bradsher was injured in
baseball practice Monday afternoon. As he
was sliding into second base, his right ankle
was badly wrenched. An x-ray. will prob-
ably reveal the extent of his-injury.

Bradsher has been the regular center-
fielder for the Wildcats for the past two
seasons, and his absence from the line-up
will be greatly felt. He led the entire Wild-
cat squad in batting last season, and was
active in semi-professional baseball last:
summer,

Besides being captain of this year’s team,
Bradsher is secretary and treasurer of the
“DPD” Club.

'Kight Lettermen and Stars of Last
Year’s Freshman Squad Report
for Workouts

SCHEDULE INCOMPLETE
Coaches Unger and Mathis Work to
Get Freshmen in Shape

*

| To date the schedules of both the fresh-

| .
;}man and varsity baseball teams have not

° | been completed, and consequently no an-
S

nouncement can be made at this time.

However, this has not deterred Coaches
| Laird, Newton, Unger, and Mathis, and
| practice has begun, with between twenty
jand thirty men reporting for practice with
| the varsity, and a good number out for the
| yearling squad.
| Coach Laird must build his varsity from
ja nucleus of eight lettermen, and a good
|group of men from last year’s Freshman
nine. The lettermen returning are Captain
Bradsher, June and Joe Morrison, all out-
fielders; Whitley, catcher; Baily and Pearce,
pitchers; Peabody, first base, and Mills,
shortstop. A gap at third base, and another
at the keystone sack will have to, be filled.
Morgan, Mackorell and Ravenel are wag-
ing a hot three-cornered battle for the hot
corner, and Smyre and Bumgarner are
fighting for second base.

Peabody, at the initial sack, should ex-
perience some hot competition in the person
of “Shrimp” Morris, one of the stars of
the 1932 Freshman team. West, a reserve
motndsman of last season, is again} out,
and Harris and Ahston, Sophomores, also
look good. Whitley, the veteran backstop,
has a splendid understudy in the Sopho-
more. Bobby Burns.

So far the Freshmen have not advanced
to the stage where anybody could pick the
players out, but a representative group is
practicing every day with Coaches Unger
and Mathis, and should soon be rounded into
| shape.

My Greatest Thrill

AS TOLD BY BRUCE PEABODY

My greatest thrill occurred in Greensboro
two years ago when we played N. C. State
at night in the floodlightseof the World
War Memorial Stadium. This was not only
my first varsity game at safety but also
my first night game and this alone created
a big thrill.

Greason’s’ punts were going so high I
could hardly see them. It was a thrill just
trying to catch that ball which looked like
a white pill descending, and then to have
a hungry “Pack” of “over-rated beef” try-
ing to “knock the daylights” out of you.
Faced with this proposition and aided by
some feeling I can’t explain, I was able to
dodge a few ravaging “Wolves” and to re-
| turn punts better than in any other game.
| Being my first real varsity game, played
jat night against a rough and heavy team,
| while scared half to death by such a big
crowd, this gave me a thrill I shall always
remember.

Bruce Peabody, besides starring on Da-
vidson’s football team for the last two years,
plays on the basketball and baseball teams,
having been captain of the former team
during the season just completed. “The
Parson,” as we know him, was also the re-
|cipient of the Tim Pharr medal awarded
| each year to the best blocker on the foot-
ball team.

FRED FLEAGLE -HALFBACK

Fred Fleagle, son of a Davidson pro-
fessor, will lead the Wildcats on the
cinder path this spring. Fred, a sprint
man on the track team, has stepped the
century in less than ten seconds on
several occasions. He also performed
brilliantly on the gridiron last fall.

*“One game is omitted from the stand-
ings. This is the final game between the
Seniors and Freshmen. The Freshmen won
the game but the eligibility of one of their
men has been contested, although this man
did not account fora single point in the 19
fo 15 victory of his team.

The Juniors defeated the Seniors 19 to 1
in a one-sided affair in which Fred Smyre
did most of the scoring. The Juniors were
without the services of Reid, regular cen-
ter, and the members_of the Senior-team
who were out for baseball also failed to
participate. A

The third-year men continued their march
by a 24-17 win over the Sophs. Smyre again
Was finding. the basket with his long shots,
and Bernardo was sinking a good many of
the same variety for his team.

By humbling the Freshmen 26 to 14 the
Junior team completed its championship
sweep. With Dolan in the line-up, the Frosh

encounter Furman last year and a’ com-

offered more resistance than was expected,

parison of the two teams cannot be made, but with Captain Smyre playing his usual

but reports have it that the South Carolina
team should give the Wildcats a tough
scrap, especially when it is the latter’s first
meet.

On April 1st they meet V. P. I. here for |

the second run of the season. Last year

}Davidson defeated V. P. I., 84 to 41, and

should repeat the same this year, but that
scrapping little team in Virginia isn’t go-
ing to take two lickings without a hard
fight.

The next meet follows in just three days
and .promises to be one of the hardest of
the year. Duke stepped on us pretty hard
last year to the tune of 81 to 44, and this
year she has proved her mettle by win-
ning the Southern Conference indoor meet
at Chapel Hill last Saturday. The Wildcats
are meeting a fierce foe in the Blue Devils
but they’ve met many before.

April’ 15th, just two days after the spring
helidays begin, the varsity will journey to
Gainesville, Fla., to encounter the ’Gacors.
Last year Florida esnt a team up here that
downed Davidson 74 to 52, but due to the}
less of several of their ‘best men they are
somewhat weakened. The ’Cats hence stand
a fair chance of defeating them on their
own ground.

On April 29th, the day the spring holi-
days end, the team will journey to Colum-
bia, S. C., to race the University of South
Carolina. Davidson downed South Carolina
last year and perhaps will do so again, but
on their home ground they may give Da-
vidson quite a bit.of trouble.

The last home meet is with Wake Forest
here. The Wildcats defeated the Deacons on
the cinder path last year, but they haven't
forgotten that we beat them in football this
year and they aren’t likely to take three
trouncings in a row.

good game and McCallie and Reid scoring:
steadily, the Juniors soon built up a safe
margin.

The shooting of Elvery and the guarding
of Bernardo featured the 24-14. win of the
Sophomores over the Freshmen. The win-
ners started off fast and scored eight
points before the more inexperienced team
hegan to make their shots count.

The Sophomores’ other win was over the

{Seniors by a score of 19 to 16, Colon Mun-

roe shot seven points to take high point
honors, while Calhoun played well for the
losing team. The second-year men had—a
10-point lead at the half, but were pushed
to win in the closing minutes.

The tournament was under the supervi-
sion of Heath Whittle, director of intra-
mural athletics, and most of the games
were refereed by members of the varsity
team.

William and Mary Tracksters Top
Virginia, Davidson, to Win in
Freshman Division

NEWARK PREP. WINNER

Evans Sets New Record
Freshman Track Event

Ras in

Ras Evans led the Davidson representa-
tives at the Southern Conference Indoor
Track Meet held at the University of North
Carolina last Saturday by winning and set-
ting a record in the 60-yard dash in the
¥reshman events. He set a precedent for
the other Wildcat runners, who also showed
up well.

Frank Parker caused much indecision as
to his placement in the high hurdles, but
was finally given third by the judges. Billy
Merchant, diminutive Freshman distance
man, finished fourth amongst outstanding
competition in the three-quarter-mile run.
These men totalled six points to take third
place in the Freshman division, running sec-
ond to the William and Mary and Virginia
Frosh. There were no éntries for non-con-
ference teams in the Varsity, competition,
therefore the Davidson Varsity-had no men
competing.

The outstanding performance of Ras
Evans in running the 60-yard dash in 6 5-10
seconds (old record 6 6-10 seconds) sur-
prised the coaches as well as others who
had seen the tall, slim speedster daily
working at it and trying to hold his own
against Fred Fleagle, Varsity sprinter and
captain. Evans is just the man needed for
next year when the Varsity will lose its
only outstanding sprinters. He, Merchant,
Parker, and Frazier will form the nucleus
of what should be a most successful yearl-
ing track team.

A total of fourteen records were broken
as Carolina witnessed one of the most illus-
trious gatherings ever held at the annual
Southern Conference Indoor Meets. Duke
captured the meet with 42 points, defeating
their favored rivals, Virginia, who followed
with 34 points. Duke led Virginia by three
