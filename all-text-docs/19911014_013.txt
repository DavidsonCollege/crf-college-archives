Where, When, And How
To Use A Condom

Condoms are one of the most
widely used forms of contracep-
tion, and are the only form that
offer any protection against the

catching or spreading of STDs,

including the AIDS virus. Of
course, condoms cannot com-
pletely eliminate the risk of preg-
nancy and STDs; only total absti-
nence is 100% effective.

What kind of condom should
you use? Latex condoms lubricated
with nonoxynol-9 spermicide are
the most effective. “Natural,” or
lambskin condoms DO NOT help
protect against the spread of the

AIDS virus. The membranes used

in lambskin condoms are porous
enough to allow the tiny virus to
get through. -

_ The spermicide nonoxynol-9 .

not only reduces the number of
active sperm, italsohas been shown
to help prevent against the AIDS
virus. Readcondom packages care-
fully to be sure they havea spermi-
cidal lubricant containing non-
oxynol-9. (Condoms provided in
dorm bathroomsare lubricated with |
nonoxynol-9.)

The most common reason for
condom breakage is failure to put

Davidson Elementary Tutoring
Program has started off witha Big
Bang! We have had many college
volunteers who are making it pos-
sible for 20 to 30 elementary aged
children to be tutored Monday

through Thursday at Davidson |

PresbyterianChurch.

Many of the children who par-
ticipate in the program have work-
ing parents who don’t have the
time to give their children help
with homework. The college vol-
unteers help the children with

schoolwork, listen to them read,
and participate in the snack and
playtime. Itis both fun and reward-
ing. Please call Rachel Dunifon (-
6042) or Grey Timberlake (-6588)
if you are interested.

Habitat for Humanity has had an
ambitious start. Davidson College
has sentover 60 students to work at
several local sites. The volunteers
have helped with the final stages of
the schoolhouse in Huntersville.
With the help of students, workers
were also able to frame and roof a
house on North Main Street in a
week. Students have been working
on the finishing touches on two
houses on Potts Street as well. In
October, Habitat is involving stu-
dents in the renovations on the Ada
Jenkins Community Center. Work
teams from the college and com-
munity plan to convert an old
school in to a community center.
Call Andrew Bazemore (-6532),
Jennifer McDonald (-6328), or Bill
Marquardt (-6552) to get involved!

Dean Rusk Program Informs

By Jennifer Reid

Last week, Mr. Bill Anderson
of the U.S. Agency for Interna-
tional Development came to cam-
pus to speak on his work on direct-
ing U.S. assistance to developing
countries in Africa. Many students,
atthis time, realized how little they

J. really knew. about countries in

Africa (or any countries outside
the U.S. and Western Europe, for

_ that matter).

The Student Advisory Com-
mittee of the Dean Rusk Program,
in an effort to broaden the interna-
tional awareness of the Davidson
community, has created several
programs which promise to be
helpful if used properly.

The first of these projects is the
“Bathroom Brigade” in which
colored maps were placed in all of
the bathrooms on campus. These

maps can be effective only if they
are not removed so that they may
be seen by all. The second program
is the weekly Davidsoniancolumn
which will highlight a different
country each week along with other
“awareness increasing” informa-
tion.

Since Africa is the topic of the
most recent speaker, this theme
will be continued by highlighting a
relatively small country on that
continent: Gambia. Anderson high-
lighted Gambia as one of the A fri-
can countries which continues to
be deserving of U.S. aid based
upon its progress in the past five
years. It is located on the western-
most coast of the continent and is
almost completely surrounded by
Senegal.

Languages: 40% of the popula-
tion speaks Mandinka.

English is the official lan-
guage, but itmakes up a very small
percentage of native speech (less
than 7%).
Government: Republic
Agriculture: rice, corn
Religion: 95% are Muslim. Due to
the Islamic heritage, Gambian men
ordinarily take four wives each

raising a family under his guid-
ance.

Food: Mostly rice with sauces and
some meat. Proper etiquette in-
volves sitting around a common
bowl and eating with one hand. It
is very impolite to extend the other
hand into the bowl.

Other: Gambiahas only one paved
road whichruns East-West through
the capital city- Banjul. Ginny
Austin (795) has lived in the
Gambia for several years and con-
tributed information to this article.
