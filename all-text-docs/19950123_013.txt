Where's the
beef?

In the future, we will be
investigating why
McDonalds decided to _
make the huge jump--next
door. But can the Big Mac
win out over the sizzling
steaks of the Lone Star just
across the way? Inquiring
minds want to know. (Find
out in the next issues of the
Davidsonian when the new
staff takes over.)

Legends provides
breathtaking
entertainment

By Tammy Tiska

Why do we love so fiercely
those who cause us the most pain?
This is the question that Legends of
the Fall concerns itself with. “He
was the rock they broke themselves
against,” is how the Cree narrator
explains Tristan Ludlow (Brad
Pitt). Directed by Edward
Ziwick, Legends of the Fall is the
story of three brothers in the first
decades of this century and the
passions that keep them just out of
each others’ reach. The film has
epic ambitions, covering war, poli-
tics, love, birth, and loss. Aidan
Quinn and Anthony Hopkins give
superb performances, and Julie
Ormonde is captivating. But the
hype that this film belongs to Brad
Pitt is not unwarranted; from the
moment he rides over the grassy

horizon under the shadow of the
Montana mountains we are as
entranced by Tristan Ludlow as
the characters in the film are.

At times I was pulled into this
movie despite my best intentions. I
tried to remind myself that the
“Damn you’’s were forced and the
score manipulatively overplayed,
but to no avail.

The combination of Pitt’s cha-
risma and the breathtaking cin-
ematography overwhelmed my
criticisms. Legends of the Fall has
the feel ofa satisfying novel, bring-
ing the characters home, grief in-
verting itself into joy and back into,
grief again. Tristan Ludlow leftme
sorrowfully pondering why in our
quest to exorcise personal demons
we alienate those who care for us
most deeply.

- Students share stories

from abroad experiences

Abroad continued from page 10

sance. In fact, Timmons actually
witnessed an elephant knock down
a tree and destroy a house one day.

Traveling the globe over acon-
tinent, we find the Asian country,
Thailand, where religion major
Seth Clippard spent last semester.
When setting out to decided where
he wanted to go originally, Clippard
knew he wanted to go to a country
where he could study either Bud-
dhism or Hinduism. ._He grabbed
the opportunity to emerge himself
in the study of Buddhism at the
Wat Pah Nanachat Monastery.
There, he practiced meditation,
something which he still hopes to
continue in the United States. He
learned many customs at the mon-
astery, for Thai is a very polite

culture. Pointing your feet at oth- :

ers while sitting is impolite, and
touching others’ heads is an unac-
ceptable practice. Clippard be-

atmosphere; there was no music or
television; he shaved his head and
eyebrows, and wore the traditional
white dress, the color of purity.
The people Clippard encoun-
tered were also very helpful and
friendly. On the bus to the monas-
tery, he suffered from food poison-
ing. (He tried ethnic foods, includ-
ing gruband tarantula.) As soonas
the other passengers realized that
he was sick, they rushed to his aid.
Clippard says that coming home
was more of a culture shock than
going to Thailand, after being de-
prived of many western conve-
niences. Still, he feels that he
learned many useful and interest-
ing things which he continues to
practice here,
“It was a lot stranger to be

_ back than to go over there,”

Clippard says. This statement
seems to be another common theme
among many students returning
