MeDavid’s Patterson Farm Experiment

There is a farm by the name
of Patterson in the town Mc-
David, where long ago a great
many creatures of the forest. all
of good breeding. lived and
played. Their favorite spot was
the great Pond of Plenty.

Also in McDavid was a large
hill on which grew a giant Onion
where other less fortunate
animals lived, jealous of the
wonders of the great pond. Over
all this reigned a great white
hunter, pale as a bean sprout,
tenant of the farm. His only
distinguishing trait was his in-
tense distaste for frogs, and
there were many frogs around

the pond.

All was well until the great
war. The hunter, armed with all
sorts of verbal pollution called
*‘principle’’", marched on the
pond with his “‘trust--ee"’ gun to
extirpate the teeming frog
population.

Tampering with the ecology
is a dangerous thing, but what
the hunter wanted was to open
up his farm to all creatures,
even those of the great Onion
on the hill, that they might plun-
der the treasures of nature on
Patterson farm.

For awhile his grand plan
succeeded and all manner ot

wildlife burgeoned around the
pond. There were flies, bees,
yaks, turkeys. lizards, and all
sorts of scaly amphibians at
play at the pond from which
they had been barred for so
long.

Only occasionally did a frog
rear its hated head to secure its
quota of insects with its sticky
tongue. The frogs had to rely on
their instinct alone to survive
since the hunter had the only
weapons.

All was merry or at least
stable for awhile, but nature,
with her cruel delight in irony,
sustained the frogs until once

again they began to claim the
pond for their own, although the
other creatures grouped
together and roamed around in
pax.

The great hunter, seeing the
change and realizing that the
frogs had survived, changed his
tune as well. No longer the
arrogant polluter, he saw the
error in his ways, yet rather
than admit his folly (which
might make him lose his job),
he recast himself as a
beneficent figure and lorded
over the farm with a gentle
hand, allowing nature to take its
true cours.

Freshmen Aided By Hall Counselors;
Nixon Termed Responsible For Murders

To the Editor:

As I was touring campus the
other day a freshman stopped
me to ask what a ‘‘Freshmen
Get Tips on Life at College’
was.

Being a pre-med, I naturally
knew that ‘“‘-FGTLC” was a
social disease occurring on the
Davidson campus which is
similar to arthritis.

Arthritis you realize flares up
continually with changes in the
weather, especially the changes
for the better. It is known as a
social disease because its cure
lies in either the penicillin of-
fered by the Union or Patterson
Court.

Under the old system of treat-
ment, Davidson experienced
only a 60 per cent ratio; the
reason being that in the past the
medicine was allowed to choose
the patient.

Now, however, our cure ratio
has risen to about 90 per cent,
since we have allowed the
patient to choose his own
medicine.

This social disease has been
an extremely prevalant diease
among freshmen at Davidson.
Classic symptoms are apathy,
cynicism, and distrust. A per-
son with this social disease
longs for past traditions and has
his eyes.shut to the future.

To combat this rise in social
disease the college decided
to concentrate on prevention
rather than cure. The Davidson
ttrustees hired the best experts
in Drs. Terry, Smith and Ster-
ing. L

Under these we have assem-
bled one of the largest groups of
young social technologists in
one area: Ralph Peeples, Jim
Campbell, Larry Duncan, and
Bruce Reichelderfer.

These experts agree that an
excellent prevention of social
disease is a daily dose of Hall
Counselor. Logic, advice, and
friendship taken as needed
from your hall counselor will
certainly keep the Social
Disease away.

After I finished my ex-
planation this freshman asked
me how I knew so much about
this disease. I answered by
saying, ‘Son, I caught the
social disease my freshman
year but I had too many people
helping me to stay sick for
long.’

To the Editor:

Like many other students
here. 1 found the results of the
recent straw poll held on cam-
pus dismaying. I can not un-
derstand how any student
anywhere can cast a ballot in

good conscience for the man
directly responsible for the
murder of eight students at
Kent and Jackson State in May
of 1970.

The man who ordered the un-
constitutional invasion of Cam-
bodia is as least as responsible
for those slayings as the
national guardsmen who pulled
the trigger at those demon-
strators on those two campuses.

The man who condoned the
actions of those guardsmen
shares in their guilt in an equal
measure. Those of us who were
on this campus in the spring of
that year can recall the horror
and outrage we felt at the news
of those murders.

When I think about the events
of two and a half years ago, of
the outrage felt everywhere,
and of the apathy so much in
evidence today, I find it difficult
to ‘forgive and forget.”

I support without hesitation
the candidacy of George
McGovern.

To the Editor:

The letter by one of our new
co-eds, Kathy Huntly, which
appeared in the September 28
DAVIDSONIAN, was a pitiable
example of the rhetorical
overkill characteristic of
adolescent emotionalism. As an
intellectual statement on
female consciousness it carried
the clout of a Rod McKuen poen.

I sincerely hope Ms. Huntly
doesn't represent the general
attitude of Davidson co-eds
toward Women's Liberation.

Ms. Huntly took exception to
a DAVIDSONIAN cartoon
which, in her opinion, depicted
Davidson women as voluptuous
feline sex objects. Since David-
son men are represented as
mental titans (faculty please
note), and not sexy pussycats,
she considered the cartoon
sexist. I find this interpretation
very hard to swallow.

Even after two years at
Davidson (single sex David-
son), I still: find it difficult to
view an animal with whiskers
as a voluptuous sex object. Such
attitudes are probably restric-
ted to four year veterans.

-Besides, for generations
Davidson students have been
represented by a feline
caricature without feeling
slighted.

Would Ms. Huntly prefer a
canine mascot for the women?
(Without knowing Ms. Huntly I
can't be certain how ap-
propriate a dog would be.)

Surely such dualism would
reflect blatant sexism. If a cat
is good enough for the men, it
ought to be good enough for the
women.

With many significant exam-
ples cf sexual discrimination
apparent throughout the college
community (consider, for in-
stance, the number of women
on the faculty or in the ad-
ministration) it is regretable

that Ms. Huntly singled out an
imaginative and very humorous
cartoon as an example = of
sexism at Davidson.

Black Students Form Union

Black students at Williams College in William-
stown, Massachusettes, recently formed the Williams
Black Student Union (WBSU) which seeks to provide
a new orientation for black conception of its identity
and role at Williams. The new WBSU hopes to in-
crease black participation in order that the interests
of the black community will be representated,
acknowledged, and influential in all areas which af-
fect their lives on campus. More WBSU members will
be encouraged and supported in their efforts to
become members of vital committees, College Coun-
cil representatives, and participants in other of-
ficially organized activities where the need for black
participation is viewed as essential.

WBSU'’s actual internal structure consists of five
work councils: Communications, Politics and Com-
munity Organizing, Education, Cultural Productions,
and Security and Maintenance. Each of these coun-
cils will have certain on-going projects that together
will involve the majority of the black student body
and will affect the entire campus.

For instance, the Communications work council
will publish WBSU's newsletter. The Education
council is directed principally with the on-campus
academic success of black students. The Education
council will provide tutorial programs to assist all
black students in staying in school. The Culture work
council already has arranged for the presentation of
films, speakers, poetry readings, theatre and poetry
workshops.

USC Cannot Search Dorms For Drugs

Dean Elizabeth Clotworthy at the University of
South Carolina recently pointed out that the ad-
ministration does not have the right to search a
student's room for drugs. According to Clotworthy,
the administration has the right to make only
scheduled room checks, and then only where the oc-
cupants of the room are present. However; a room
can be searched by city police with a search warrant
if a student is suspected of using or selling drugs.

A student suspected by a hall advisor of using drugs
usually mat is warned of the consequences of con-
tinuing drup use. If a student is on drugs and wants
help, he can go to one of the counseling services
available on the USC campus. As long as the student
asks for help, his use of drugs will be kept con-
fidential.

He even began trying to com-
municate with all the animals,
including the frogs, and bought
them ice cream, for as we all
know, everyone likes ice cream.

The animals now called him.
affectionately. ‘‘The Emperor of
Ice Cream,” but the frogs still
remembered the great war, and
they kept in mind the thought
that ice cream can be as cold as
it is sweet and always melts un-
der pressure.

In the meantime the frogs and
other animals tried to get along
with each other by meeting
together and talking about how
to increase the wildlife on Pat-
terson Farm. Of course the
main source of new blood lived
on top of the great hill where all
the members of Patterson
Farm originally came from.

The problem was how to get
the fresh new animals down off
the hill to the pond. The only
contact which the new ones had
made with the farm was what
they had eaten around the pond,
but but the hunter only allowed
newcomers to eat ‘‘a la carte,”’
which is French for ‘‘not very
much, in fact, not enough.”’ Ab-
breviated, it is ‘‘ARA.”’

Since all the animals of the
farm were chary lest the balance
in nature be upset again, there
was to be an effort to make sure
that all newcomers were
properly oriented and
distributed around the Pond of
Plenty. This would keep the
Emperor of Ice Cream passive.

As a special precaution, all
newcomers were to wait until
the winter set in before visiting
the pond, in order that the old
hunter might have the whole
fall to wander around the farm
and talk to himself, as though
nature still cared what he had to
say after what he had done.

There was one slight

; however, in waiting
until winter. It seems that in the
days of the great war, some
frogs fled the pond rather than
face up to the hunter and had
settled down elsewhere to fend
for themselves.

These . members of a
different SPE-cies, croaked
very loud and with little cool,
but they were safely beyond the
wrath of the hunter.

The milder frogs at Patterson
Farm wanted the other frogs to
return and be a part of their
plan, but the other creatures on
the farm did not agree, fearful
of the loud uncool croaking.

Nevertheless, the
frogs did finally decide to come
to their old pond to eat at Ran-
dom, but other wise they
traveled about freely, ignoring
the wishes of the other animals,
including the mild frogs, their
friends at one time.

These rebel frogs took ad-
vantage of the fall moratorium
to go up on the hill and invite
new creatures to their own little
farm before the animals at Pat-
terson had their chance.

Some of the new creatures,
unaware of the joys of Pat-
terson Farm, joined the
renegade frogs.

And all this time the other
animals at Patterson could only
wait for winter and wonder of
the future, wiser in the
knowledge that much misery
can come from the pious
ignorance of an old hunter.

There is one other ex-
perimental farm that grew up
recently in McDavid that deser-
ves mention as an appropriate
sequel to this story.

This farm began this year and
is known as Ney House, a place
where a group of male am-
phibians live homogeneously.
The house is called Ney after
the great Charles Schultz, but
the important thing about it to
remember is that from places
such as this come the great
white killers of the future.
