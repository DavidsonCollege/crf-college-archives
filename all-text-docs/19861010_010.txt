Football team assaulted by Mountaineers, 63-6

By MIKE ADAMS

In what sophomore receiver
Mike Gross called “a long day at
the office,” the Appalachian State
football team rolled over David-
sor. 63-6 at Boone last Saturday.

As the score suggests, Ap-
palachian totally dominated the
game. The Mountaineers had 33
first downs to the Wildcats’ 11.
They piled up 596 total yards
while Davidson could manage
only 159 yards.

The only statistical category in
which the Cats led was time of
possession. Davidson led here ba-
sically because it just didn’t take
Appalachian long to score once
they got the ball.

And score they did. On 15
possessions, the Mountaineers
were able to produce nine drives
that ended in touchdowns, one
that ended in a field goal and only
three that ended in punts. The
other two drives ended as time ex-
pired in each half.

The strength of the Appalac-
hian attack was its running game.
Three Mountaineer running backs
gained over 100 yards. John Set-
tle; the leading rusher in the
Southern Conference last year,
led the’ way with with 183 yard
and five touchdowns on just 23
carries. ~

games this week to bring its record
to 3-8-1. A 3:2 win at Georgia
State on Saturday was followed by

kins put the ball in the right hand

the penalty box. Sophomore for-
ward Mike Friedlander and junior
midfielder Steve Ott were credited
with the assists.

Georgia State then responded
with two goals in the first half to

Women’s volleyball hits dry spell: -

By SUSAN WILKINS
—_—--The women’s volleyball team
is going through a dry spell. One

this week of competition with
three losses and no wins.

The team started off the week
with a double match against High
Point and Lenoir-Rhyne at High
Point. Their first game was
against Lenoir-Rhyne, a team
they had lost to_before, but that

opening quarter. They allowed a
touchdown on Appalachian’s first
possession, but prevented any
other Mountaineer scores and the
quarter ended with the Cats losing
only 7-0.

The floodgates opened in the
second quarter, though. Appalac-
hian scored three times in just over
six minutes to open a 26-0 lead
(two extra point attempts were un-
successful). Settle ran for the
score on all of the Mountaineers’
first four touchdowns.

Up to this point the Cats were
able. to generate almost no of-
fense. They had lousy field posi-
tion arid were forced to punt on
their first six possessions. They
notched only five first downs in
their first six drives. .

The Wildcat defense stiffened
after the Mountaineers ‘opened
their .26-0 lead, however, and
forced a punt on the next Appalac-
hian-drive.* --

The Mountaineer punter
boomed a 48-yard kick, but ‘the
Cats tried a little razzle-dazzle
with sophomore Bryan Overcash

handing off on a reverse to junior -

Aaron Edwards who returned the
ball 28 yards to the Appalachian
43-yard line.

Freshman quarterback Peter
Hughes, who replaced senior star-
ter Steve Bradley early in the sec-
ond quarter, proved able 'to move

Davidson equalized before the
half on a corner kick. Hankins,
taking the corner, sent the ball out
to senior forward Brian Shockley
just outside the penalty box.
Shockley promptly fired at the
goal. Friedlander, standing at the
six-yard box, misdirected the shot
into the opposite side of the goal

ing room.

Hughes opened the drive with
a 19-yard completion to Overcash
across the middle. A one-yard run
and an incomplete pass brought
the Cats to third and nine.

Davidson then pulled some-
thing else out of its bag of tricks,
running Gross on an end-around
for a 21-yard gain to the seven-
yard line. Appalachian picked up

an interference penalty to give the
Cats a first down at the Moun-
taineer two and, after a pass for no
gain to Edwards, Hughes ran it in
for the touchdown to make the
score 26-6 after the two-point con-
version attempt failed.

This touchdown turned out to
be the only real bright spot in what
was a very long afternoon for the
Cats. Appalachian scored once
more in the first half and went on

to notch four more touchdowns
and one field goal in the second.
Davidson failed to make any real
offensive threats after their first
half score. so

Davidson will be at home for
the next two weeks. They play
Bucknell on Saturday and
Lafayette in the Homecoming
game the next week. These teams
should be a little more on David-
son’s level.
