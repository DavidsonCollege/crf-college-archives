JOURNEY...
...On into the ‘90s

By RoBert Briccs
Staff Writers

The 90’s have been a difficult

time for some of the most success-
ful recording artists of the previ-
ous decade, Many acts with plati-
num and gold records hanging on
their walls have been reduced to
“Where Are They Now” and “It
Came From the Eighties” specials
on VH-1 and MTV. Even former

‘pop culture icons Prince and
Michael Jackson are now men-

- tioned in the news more for their
marital status and record company
woes than for their latest musical
releases.

So why would Journey, aband
that enjoyed its greatest success
near the beginning of 80s and
hadn’t released a new studio al-
bum in ten years, decide to fight
the stigma of its heyday and a
possible generation gap to attempt
a comeback in 1996? Simply be-
cause for Journey, success was
never based upon crashing synthe-
sizers and cheap music videos; for
them the formula for success was
based upon soaring melodies and
the enchantment of lead singer
Steve Perry’s vocals (which ex-
plains why some of their biggest
hits, “
have been adult contemporary stan-
dards.)

Journey recaptures the essence
of what made them great on their
néw Columbia Records release
“Trial By Fire.”

While some songs show that
they were a band of the eighties,
many songs, like the albums first
single “When You Love A
Woman” do a magnificent job of
combining enchanting piano riffs
with Steve Perry’s almostethereal
voice. “Don’t Be Down On Me
Baby” and “It’s Just The Rain”

have the feel of songs written and
recorded without the influence of
time and trends.

‘ The bandalso shows its adapt-
ability to current trends with their
lush string and acoustic guitar ar-
rangements on the album’s title
track.

If “Trial By Fire” is an indica-
tion of things to come, then Jour-

tensive programs of Korean tradi-

The program represents a two
thousand year history of one of
Asia’s most important cultural tra-
ditions. The arts of Korea were
highly informed by shamanic prac-
tices of Siberia that have perme-
ated virtually every aspect of the
culture up to the present. In the Sth
century, the mask dance became a
vehicle for Satirizing monks given

ills imposed upon the lowerclasses.
The artists from the Korean Per-
forming Arts Institute, Inc. also

originally a royal music institute
and was maintained by each suc-
cessive dynasty.

The folk mask dance expresses
the human feelings of the people
