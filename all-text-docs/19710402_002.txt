Smith Emphasizes Need |

ForFuture Union Building

By WINDY MARCH
Staff Writer
Director of the College Un-
ion C. Shaw Smith is some-
what worried about the fu-

ture of the union, since it is —

to be the site of the Davidson
College Library. But he says
the whole thing could be ‘‘a
blessing in disguise."’

Smith was emphatic about
one thing: “If we don’t get a
building eventually, we're
lost. We'll have lost a sym-
bol of unity on the campus.”

“Ideally,”
should build the new union at
the same time that we build
the new library.”’ But Smith
admitted that financial pres-
sure could likely prevent

White States
480 Accepted

Approximately 480 letters
of acceptance were mailed to
high school seniors yester-
day by “the Office of Admis-
sions. ‘‘We're hoping to have

a freshmen class next, year’ ’

of 315,"’ stated H. Edmonds
White, director of admissions
and financial aid.

Asked why the number of
acceptances was so large,
White replied, ‘‘To reduce the
Financial overhead.”
had the impression from in-
dividual cases that the qual-
ity of the applicants had not
declined this year,

According’ to White, the
number of applications de-
clined because of rising costs,
tight money, a fall in interest
in college, among high school
students, and_ integration,
which.created problems
which diverted guidance
counselors from college ad-
vising.

Freshmen will room next
year in East, Cannon, and on
the upper three floors of
Watts.

this, and said that no plans
either for relocation or pres-
ent union activities ‘or for a
new building are definite yet.

Smith seemed to think that
a temporary lack of a union
building would pose no prob-
lems which could not be ov-
ercome by cooperation be-
tween, members of the vari-
ous dislocated activities, and
with the faculty.

“In fact,”’ he said, ‘‘such a
situation could help us trim
the fat off the programs we
run, and help us come up
with ideas for new. programs.
In some cases, permanent re-
location of union activities
away trom the union build-
ing might turn out to be ben-
eficial. So it could be a bless-
ing.in disguise.”

Smith specifically mention-
ed the possibility of-a small
theater downtown to run col-
lege-sponsored movies, a re-
located book store, and par-
ties, mini-concerts or other
activities in dorm lounges.

But we- would still have to |

have a building around which
these activities ceuld. cen-
ter,"’ he said.

Smith seemed fairly opti-
mistic about the prospect of
using the library as the new
union building. The lo@ation
is worse than this one, but
it’s a bettér building,’’ he
said. ‘‘A new building, in a
location more central to stu-
dent lift, “would be _ better.
But we could work with the
library building.”’

Smith said that as far as
he knew, the earliest possible
date for tearing down the un-
ion building is next spring.
‘‘For the interim period,’’ he
said, ‘‘there is a lot of rela-
tively unused space on cam-
pus which could accommo-
date our programs. And if
we change our program of

Three concert groups, folk

Miss Collins will make her
first appearance at David-
son in five years on Friday
night. She will sing a two-
hour concert in Love Audi-
torium, beginning at 8 p.m.

‘‘We wanted to get a real-
ly big act for this week-end,”
said Social Council
man Duff Bruce, ‘‘and we
thought Judy Collins was the
act that would appeal to
most people on campus.”

Miss Collins, who has been
nationally prominent for
several years, is most re-

_ cently known for her ren-
“dition of ‘Both Sides Now”

and “Amazing Grace.”

Following Miss Collins on
Friday night will be Steve
Gillett. He will perform in
the Morrison Room starting

at midnight.

Gillett, a California-based
folk singer, appeared at Da-
vidson last year. He is best
known as the author of ‘‘’m
Back on the Street Again,”
a song which was popular a
few years ago, when record-
ed by the Seekers

Bruce described the group

“as ‘‘a rock group, with brass,

but a softer sound than Chi-

“Some music critics ‘that

better than Chicago, because
of their softer sound,” said
Bruce.

After the Dreams concert,
there will be a blanket con-

The concert is presently

Spencer Says Economy

Cuts Non-Dorin Housing

By RICH WILSON
Managing Editor

College President Samuel
R. Spencer Jr. * announced
this week that applications
for off-campus living during
the 1971-72 academic year
will not be accepted until

the college reviews the pre-

sent procedure.

Spencer expressed concern
that the dormitories are not
being filled to capacity. ‘‘We
have 931 spaces for stu-
dents,” said Spencer, ‘but
because of attrition we get
down to. about 900 by the
end of the year.

“Obviously it is not very
economical for the college
to have empty rooms,” he
said. ‘It is important that

all the dormitories are fill-
ed.”

~Spencer said this announce-
ment was not actually a
change in school policy, since
all students are required to
live on campus unless there
is no longer any space ‘for
them in the dorms.

“This does not mean, how-
ever, that there will be no
students living off campus
next year,” he said. ‘‘We
just want to see where we
stand in regard to dormitory
capacity before we allow
students to live off campus
next year.”

Spencer indicated that the
administration would be
finished with its evaluation
within ‘‘a few weeks.”
