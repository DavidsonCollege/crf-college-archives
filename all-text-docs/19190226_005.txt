Captain Slaymaker
Speaks at “Y” Service

“The

Manhood of the Master” is
Discussed.

Captain Slaymaker spoke at the Y.
M. CL A. vesper. service last Sunday
night. Captain Slaymaker is » veteran
of two wars, having fought in the Span-
ish-American war and the Great avar.

He remarked that he was always glad
to be with young mea—they were tull
of all Kinds of possibilities, "Che war
has tiught us the lesson of service,” he
said. and told many instances in which
service had become the dominant desire
and passion of a man’s lite, “He profits
mest whe serves best.” and the highest
service of all. as he said. is to serve
Christ with your whole time, and added
to this is the tact that. you would then
be serving ina cause that you know will
win,

_ Captain Slaymaker had been teaching
a men’s Bible class composed of over
2co men, in which they were studying a
little book. “Phe Manhood of the Mas-
ter.” by Kasdick. “This beak had proved
‘of great benefit and was. very pepulitr, sa
he wished to draw: some lessons from it:

In the first place. the general concep-
tion ot Christ is that of a silent, gloomy.
morose inan, due to the erroneous ident
ot artists. This is utterly untrue: ane
ot His favorite capressions was equiva:
lent ta “cheer up” ("be &f good cheer").
His first: miracle was performed to, save
a hostess embarrassment.

tle was magnanimous. While on the
cross He said: “Father torgive them tor
tes know not what ther do How-
ever when others were being wronged
Hie became angry. \Vhen thus aroused
He vould dety ‘an angry mob because
tle knew He was in the right.

He was sincere He refused to be
mide king. when it was not in accord
with Tlis mission,

Ne had endurance and patience. Ee
was accarpenter until thirty vears of ate
hefare raking up His ite work and He
bore with His disciples who were at
times.so slow to understand Him.

Tle was a man. Fle must have been a
man to-clear the temple and to drive the
munes changers fram their upset tables.
He must have been a man to force from
Pilate’. Hips the exclamation, “Behold
the mani.’ even after His long hours of
agony in the garden and his subsequent
sufteryngs.

“The greatest calling in the world ts
the service of Christ.” said Captain Slay-
maker again. “and never Iet God's name
pass vour lips, exeept in reverence.”
