The Davidsonian

Booters Gain 2-2 Tie With Belmont

By CHRIS YOUNG
Staff Writer

All the hopes of a conference
championship for the Davidson
soccer team vanished Saturday
when Appalachian defeated The
Citadel to capture the top
position in the Southern
Division of the Sothern Con-
ference.

The Apps finished the season
with a 2-0-1 record in the con-
ference. They will meet the win-
ner of the Northern Division to
determine the conference
champions.

While this was taking place,
the Davidson squad was playing
fine N.C. State team which had
won its six previous
games.State also sported a
player named Shianouk, who
had been selected to play
goalie for the All-Asian soccer
team.

Chip Stone, head coach of the
Wildcats, referred to Shianouk
as “the best individual player
we'll play against all year.

Nonetheless, the Cat squad
ventured to Raleigh with a
strong attitude and played an
admirable game, finally losing
the contest, 3-1.

The Cats made two costly fir-

st half errors which contributed
heavily to the defeat.

Tom Blackwood and Paul
Parker played especially well
in the losing effort. Jack Linard

had a good game also, scoring
the only Davidson goal.

Stone was pleased with the
Cats’ performances in the State
Game, as he has been with the
recent improvement of the
team.

In a game last Tuesday, the
Cats were out to avenge the
defeat against a tough Belmont
Abbey team, which boasted a 9-
2 record coming into the game.

Davidson rallied from a 10
halftime deficit to tie Belmont-
Abbey 2-2 in what turned out to
be a very physical battle.

The Cats relied on goals by
Tom Tornee and Linard, who
boasted his season total to nine
goals.

Linard commented on the
physical aspects of the contest,
saying that the Belmont squad
was ‘‘a bunch of hackers.”

For those unfamiliar with the
soccer jargon employed by
Linard, a ‘‘hacker”’ is someone
who kicks an opposing player
after he has already kicked or
headed away the ball.

Linard’s bruised shins and
swollen nose proved his point
quite adequately.

The Wildcats play Emory
tomorrow in Atlanta, Ga. to
close out their 1973 campaign.

The team is already looking

forward to the coming year,
when they should greatly im-
prove on their present record of
five wins, six losses, and two
ties.

return to his home in Denmark.

The experience gained by this

includes nine sophomores and
13 freshmen, should serve them
well in future competition.
Stone will also be returning for
his second year as head coach
of the Cats.

Davidson soccer star Jack Linard sets up one of the numerous plays the Cats used in their 3-1 loss to
the Wolfpack of North Carolina State last Saturday. Linard has nine goals thus far this season, which
makes him the top soccer for the booters, who have one game remaining against Emory tomorrow.
The Cats will be looking for a victory in their final outing in order to finish the campaign with an even

record of 6-6-2.

In other years, Davidson’s
fourth place position in the
eliminations would have
automatically excluded them
from the Fall Championships.
There is a good possibility,
however, that Davidson will be
among the six other schools
competing in Charleston, S. C.
on Nov. 10.

Last weekend Davidson
hosted its annual Fall Regatta,
which was this year’s
elimination trials for the Fall
Championships. Light air
plagued the early morning
races, causing a brief _ post-
ponment. The wind picked up
after lunch, however, and all
the races were run Saturday af-
ternoon.

The competition was very
close throughout the day. The
final scores reflect this tight-
ness.

University of Tennessee was
the lowpoint victor with 20
points, the College of Charleston
finished second with 28 points,
The Citadel placed third with 29
points and Davidson followed
closely with 30 points for a
fourth place finish.

Georgia Tech was well en-
trenched in last place with a
high-point total of 43.

Davidson’s participation in
the championships this year
hinges on The Citadel and
College of Charleston's luck in
finding two more boats.

skipper for their B team, com-
mented that, ‘‘The chances are
very good of finding two more
420’s to use in the races’’. If the
extra boats are secured, the Cat
sailors will be able to compete.

In addition to the Charleston
regatta, future sailing activities
includes a regatta to be sailed
at Duke this weekend.

Daryl Douglas and Frank
Somerville will represent
Davidson. Randy Henwood will
crew for Douglas and Somer-
ville will have Dave Francis as
his crew.

Formal sailing practice will
stop after Nov. 10. But Douglas
stated that some ‘‘frostbite”
racing will be done this winter.

ball situation knows that at least two of our remaining
three or four conference opponents (Appalachian and
Furman), are building their teams up to a point
where they will be able to challenge the three powers
within the next couple of years.

In other words, Davidson football is in for at least
two of the roughest years of its existence. Davidson
has nothing to gain by remaining in the Southern Con-
ference except an ever weakening possibility at an
NCAA bid in the basketball playoffs.

In desubsidizing and retaining at least three
Southern Conference opponents for the next two
years, the trustees are insuring the humiliation of the

football team.

At the same time, the trustees are virtually asking
to be thrown out of the conference. A great deal more
good in the interest of a ‘“‘more competitive schedule”’
could have been achieved if the trustees had voted to
drop out of the Southern Conference entirely.
