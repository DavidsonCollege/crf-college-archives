Bats invade Fourth
Watts dormitory

RLO works to remove
unwanted visitors
from Watts attic

By BEN WHIGHAM
Senior Staff Writer

Bats invaded three separate rooms
on the fourth floor of Watts Residence
Hall during the past few weeks.
While no bites have been reported,
one sophomore sustained minor in-
jury in removing the animals.

School officials are looking to
contain the bats, which nest in Watts’
attic.

“You can hear them fluttering
around at night,” said Lisa Vander
Griend ’07.

Current residents began having
problems two weeks ago.

In the first incident, a bat entered
the room of sophomores Ariel
Bugosh and Ruchi Turakhia through
an open window. The bat perched
behind the blinds for some time be-
fore they noticed it.

“When I heard it rustling behind
my blinds, I thought it was a bug.
Once I realized it was abat, all could
think was rabies, so I left as fast as I
could,” said Bugosh. “Fortunately
there were enough gutsy people on
the hall who were willing to chase
the bat around the room for over an
hour until they caught it and took it
away. It was very disturbing and I
haven't opened my window since.”

“Gutsy people” Elizabeth Berndt
°07 and Amir Vaez ’07 captured the
bat and release it outside the build-
ing.

“I was going to throw shoes at it,

but some people had caught it in a
cereal bowl,” said fourth Watts Resi-
dent Advisor Lauren Finley ’07. “It’s
good it didn’t get hurt.”

A few days later, Mandy Rhyme
°07 fell asleep in the late afternoon
with her windows open. Rhyne
awoke after dark to find a brown bat
circling around her room. Rhyme lay
frozen for several moments before
covering herself in a blanket and
darting into the hall. She then yelled
for help.

Coming to her aid, Berndt entered
the room and tried to drive the bat
out the window witha lacrosse stick.

Chad Barlow ’07 later joined the
effort, using his hat to strike at the
bat.

While successful in forcing the bat
out the window, Barlow pulled a
muscle in his neck.

“It’s still pretty sore,” said Barlow.

A few days after the incident,
Berndt and her roommate Margaret
Whipple ’07 awoke at 6 a.m. to find
two bats perched on their blinds.

Berndt managed to knock one bat
out the window and trap the other in
a.trash can.

Her window had been closed, how-
ever, prompting concerns that the
bats entered through holes in her
closet.

“The first thing that concerned me
was that bats can carry diseases, es-
pecially rabies,” said Berndt.

“If someone gets bitten, it could
keep them out of school for weeks.”

Biology professor Matt Stanback
reassures Davidson students that the
risk is minimal.

“The bats on fourth Watts are big

First years mingle with the rest of the campus for the
first time on Patterson Court during First Night Down.

First Night Down sees fewer
violations, mixed reviews

By Carey BAXTER

Staff Writer

After much anticipation, First
Night Down came and went with
fewer violations than last year and
mixed reviews.

First Night Down names the first
Friday that first-year students are al-
lowed down to Patterson Court, oc-
curring after three weeks of school.

It officially begins the recruitment
season for fraternities and eating
houses.

And it is “a rite of passage,” ac-
cording to Davidson College Chief
of Police Fountain Walker.

Walker reports that “between Fri-
day and Saturday, approximately
seven alcohol violations were issued
by your Public Safety & Police De-
partment. There were two individu-
als transported to the hospital due to
alcohol induced illnesses. One was a
student and the other an alum.”

Public Safety issued more viola-
tions last year, “but not by much,”
said Walker.

Walker expressed a desire for stu-

dents to enjoy themselves but to be
aware of the fact that they can go too
far. Officers fron Public Safety went
to every freshman hall before First
Night Down toremind students of the
health risks of alcohol abuse.

“Our expectation is for people to
be safe and be aware of one another,”
he said last Thursday. “I want people
to be looking out for each other.”

Eight of the 12 houses of Patterson
Court underwent serious makeovers
prior to the big event.

Thanks to a financial gift from
Davidson College, “the houses have
received upgrades in kitchen equip-
ment, enlarged bathroom facilities,
and cosmetic refurbishment,” said
Patterson Court Advisor Joy Hamm.
Other improvements include central
heating and air conditioning and new
fire and security systems.

Members of the houses partici-
pated in the renovation process by
choosing their own interior layout
design. They also decided on paint
colorand tile style “to make the house

research

Davidson’s commitment to under-
graduate research opportunities was
recently recognized in U.S. News and
World Report’s annual ranking of
Colleges and Universities.

Davidson was among 36 institu-
tions most mentioned in a peer as-
sessment survey of colleges at which
faculty members and students “do
intensive and self-directed research
or creative work that results in an
original scholarly paper or other
product that can be formally pre-
sented on or off campus.”

Davidson shared the list with such
schools as Williams, Carlton,
Harvard, Duke and UC-Berkeley.

“We’ ve set ourselves apart,” said

President Vagt of the U.S. News rec-
ognition. “Over the last four to five
years, student-faculty research has

Monday through Friday, Assistant
Dean of Student Life Ernest Jeffries
handles minority student services
and provides academic support for
the college.

On Sundays, however, he takes on
adifferent mission: ministering to the
congregation of Gethsemane Baptist
Church.

“T’maperson whois really moved

and inspired by people and the rela-
tionships I form,” Jeffries said. “Just
to see people being uplifted and en-
couraged after a service inspires me.
Church is a place where people with
problems need to come to get a dif-
ferent perspective of how they can
handle their problems.”

Jeffries began working as a dean
at Davidson nine years ago and is
currently responsible for providing
support and services to minority stu-
dents. He directs the tutoring pro-

wanna te

gram and administers student emer-
gency loans. Jeffries also serves as
the college’s chief judicial officer,
meaning that he oversees the Code
of Responsibility and the process that
students go through when they com-
mit Honor Code infractions.

Dean of Student Life and advisor of

Phi Alpha, Intervarsity Fellowship,
and the gospel choir have allowed
