Judicial Board Debate Gives Aid To Talent { l

The Student Council has ended in a stalemate after
several weeks of debate and discussion about the pro-
posed Judicial Board. Meeting twice this week, the coun-
cil decided that it was so evenly divided on the issue it
would invite faculty members to its meeting next Mon-
day night in a further attempt to reach a satisfactory
solution. :

Monday night the council RESTORE HONOR

rescinded its action to create
a Judicial Board in the new
constitution by a vote of five to
six after a previous vote, five
to six also, had voted down a
proposal to table any action on
the board.
TIE VOTE

Meeting during Wednesday's
chapel period, the council dis-
cussed the question of requir-
ing council members to take an
oath making them honor bound

to uphold the Student Body
Regulations. The vote on this
question ended in a tie.

These two issues are closely
related, as President Henry
Shue pointed out. in that the
new proposals for a Judicial
Board and no oath are part of a!
hew concept of honor.

Under this new concept. only
violations of the Honor System
are to be tried by the Honor
Court, while Student Bodv Reg-
ulations violators are to be
tried by the lesser Judicial
Board.

Proponents of this plan say
that it recognizes the current
attitude toward the Honor Sys.
tem among students and offers
a way to restore the sense of
honor.

Those proposing this meas-
ure agree on the problem but
do not feel that the new sys-
tem will improve the situation,
and may serve to seriously up-
set the student government.

Several hours of council time
has been devoted to the dis-
cussion of this issue and at
least three votes have been
taken. This coming Monday
hight the council hopes to
reach a final decision on the
board and the oath.

present and future students at
Davidson. These awards will
run from $100 to $600 per year
and are renewable.

To qualify, one must be a
student at the present time or
must be accepted for admis-
sion. Donald Plott, head of the
department, said the grants are
designed to encourage musi-
cally talented students to ap-
ply to Davidson.

Before the new program,
only five music scholarships
were awarded, including the
Theodore Presser Scholarship,
given by the Presser Founda-
tion in Philadelphia. It is esti-
mated that seven or eight will
be given next year, with the ma-
jority going to incoming fresh-
men.

First consideration will be
given to music majors, but it
is not essential that a student
be a music major to be eligible,
Plott explained. Full informa-
tion on the program may be
obtained from him.

. Gay Camival In Panama Is
“|Last Fling Before Easter

By TONY DIAZ
Davidsonian Feature Writer

| Editor’s Note: The writer came to Davidson in 1958 from
Panama as a Richardson Scholar and is now a junior.

The history of Carnival in Panama dates back to
1673 with the beginning of a brave new city. Today with
the traditions of nearly three centuries behind her,

FRANK PORTER GRAHAM, U.N. mediator between Pakistan and India, speaks with
DAVIDSONIAN staff members after his appearance in assembly lest Tuesday. Speaking on
the moral force of the United Nations, Graham pointed out the need for support of the

U.N.’s policy.

Graham Expresses Faith
In Today’s College Man

By BOB MOORE
Davidsonian Associate Editor

“I don’t find that there is a lack of commitment among college students to-
day,” said Dr. Frank P. Graham.

Dr. Graham sat down and
folded his hands. “I can give
you an example of student com-
mitment. Al Lowenstein, a
Yale student, petitioned the
United Nations for an African
tribe after his trip to Africa.

“Al’s action has helped focus
attention’ on Southwest Africa
and he is now appearing be-
fore the World Court. I often
see student commitment like
this as a member of the United
States delegation to the U. N.

“The backwash of the Me-
Carthy era did have some ad-
verse effect upon young peo-
ple joining good causes; this
is passing away.

“I never have thought that
this was the lost or the scared
generation. I read THE DAVID-
SONIAN last night—that didn’t
sound like the scared genera.
tion to me. ‘

a great deal of thinking on this man what he though was the’

matter; probably a great many
are in a state of transition of
thought on it.”

"Take your own Rhodes
Scholar at Davidson who has
taken some stands of con-
science. You haven’t turned
your back on him; ° you
elected him president of the
student body.”

We asked Dr. Graham if he
had seen evidence of increas-
ing emphasis on materialism

man brotherhood and American
freedom. They should enter the
struggle to end the arms race
and make a stronger United Na-
tions for peace-upon which de-
pends the survival of the hu.
man race.

“If I didn't believe in the
youth of today I'd give up.”

Panama City celebrates the four-day pre-Lenten period

with a flair all of her own.

Like the Rio de Janeiro Car-
nival, like the Mardi Gras in
New Orleans, Carnival in Pan-
ama is a last fling of gaiety be-
fore the forty quiet days pre-
ceding Easter.

In the sophisticated capital
the streets are filled with peo-
ple wearing the traditional cos-
tumes: the delicately embroi-
dered flounces of the “pollera.’’
the wide cotton shirt of the
“montuna” or “tumba hombre”
(knock the man down!), the
homespun fringed shirt and
cotton pants of the “montuno.”

open cars or trucks, each bear-
ing a load of costumed rev-
elers. Carriages, relics of the
canal construction days and
drawn by horses looking old
and tired enough to be of the
same vintage, provide leisurely
transportation for tourists and
residents alike.

As the pale dawn of Ash
Wednesday creeps over Panama
City the last of the carnival
rites is performed, the mock-
solemn “burial of the fish” sig-
nifying that carnival is over,
and the sober perod of Lent
begins.

ECHO LINGERS

In the streets there still lin-
gers for a while the echo of
carnival, the reverberation of
a lilting song, the tap of
dancing feet. On the terrace of
the Union Club, where the
flags hang motionless in the

Wednesday carnival is in full
swing. These carnivals have
been “official” (government
sponsored) since 1910, so that
night the official queen is
crowned in an impressive pub-
lic ceremony, and there begins
a four-day festival during which
many people boast that they do
not sleep at all.

At almost all hours of day or

night the streets are filled with

the gay assemblage seems to
move silently about the floor.

Again, in the imagination,
the flute and the drum beat
their rhythm, again there is a
graceful invitation, the polite
flirtaton of the dance of the
“tamborito,” the quick shuffle
and swinging hips of the
“cumbia.”

Still. there lingers the mem-
ory of. laughing faces, sparkling
eyes and curving lips.

“GIVE A MAN A TOUGH JOB AND A CHANCE TO GO SOMEWHERE

...AND HE'LL BREAK HIS NECK TO DO IT”

In 1958 when Bill Ebben was only a few months
away from his engineering degree at the University
of Detroit, he was in touch with 15 prospective

employers.

He chose the Michigan Bell Telephone Com-
pany because: “This company offered the kind of
engineering management opportunity I wanted—
and they weren’t kidding.”

One of Bill’s
Michigan Bell’s big

first assignments was a survey of

Central District to find out

how long available building space could accom-
modate the switching equipment required by rapid
telephone growth. “I wasn’t given any instruc-
tion,” Bill says, “I was just told to do the job.”

So Bill did it. His report became the guide for
planning and budgeting future construction.

On his next move, Bill proved he could handle
supervisory responsibility, He was sent to head up

distance switching center for Saginaw, Michigan
—a $4,000,000 engineering project.

Today, Bill is on the staff of Michigan Bell's
Program Engineer. He’s working on a system for
mechanized control of telephone construction costs.

How does Bill feel about his job? “Give a man
a tough job and a chance to go somewhere—and
he'll break his neck-to do it. Of course, I don’t
think I’m going to be running the business next

year—but I’m getting every

opportunity to hit the

top, You don’t.worry about opportunity here—you
worry about whether you're as big as the job.”

size up a job, figure out what needs to be done, and
then do it—then you should get in touch with one of

the Bell Companies. Visit your Placement
