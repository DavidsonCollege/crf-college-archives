station in life. The “Y" makes an
effort to contribute it’s important
part to that preparation. One does
not necessarily have to be active in
“Y" work to derive this benefit.
Many phases of the total program
are designed so as to benefit those
who will give of their time to re-
ceive. We see an example of this in
the Spring and Fall services held
each year on the campus under the
sponsorship of the “Y". If We are

of this organization we can
help but broaden the whole of our
college experience.

I11.-Third, it helps us to form the
habit of giving ourselves to some-
one or something outside of our-
selves. This is admittedly a very im-
portant principle in living a whole-
some life. Most of us are inclined
to be selfish with our time, our per-
sonality, and our possessions. There
are few who will admit that this is
good. Therefore it is wise that we
seek to develop less selfish attitudes
as we prepare for our particular path
through life. We believe in this
principle so strongly that about one
hundred and fifty men are willing
to give of their time unselfishly
to help those who need them. Then
too, every year we have nearly one
hundred percent of our student bo-
dy that responds generously and
nobly to the annual “Y” Christmas
Gift Fund. More often than not we
really do for ourselves when we do
for others.

IV. Fourth, we should be con-
cerned with the “Y’ program be-
cause weractually have an invest-
ment in it: It is primarily of the stu-
dents and for the students. The fi-
nancial obligations are met largely
by a part of the student activity fee
and the Sunday evening offerings.
The actual work it does is done by
students. With this sort of an in-
vestment, it seems only logical that
we should be concerned With what
the “Y"’ does.

Here presented are four import-
ant reasons why a member of the
Davidson Student body should be
interested in what YU tees

which this year is under the head
of Dave Anderson. This depart-

tivity for the boys living in and
around Davidson.

Each of the student leaders help-
ing in the work has a pack of fol-
lowers which look to him for ath-
letic coaching and Christian gui-
dance. The boys are out to produce

in team work, and real effort.

Huntersville. Seven games have
been played so far, and a full sched-
ule is still before each group. Equip-
ment, though at times a real prob-
lem, is provided by the “Y?’ and the
use of the “Y" car is a big help
to the leaders.

The Davidson men on the coach-
ing ‘staff make up a cooperative
group which goes all out for the

boys. Led off by John McBride,
the group consists of seven stu-
dents. John has put many hours

with the Davidson group’s team, last
year and this. He has the rea] re-
spect'of the boys, and deserves real
commendation, Helping John is Bob

Gregsby, who is also doing a fine
piece of work.

At Cornelius, Jim Grissom and
Cecil Rhodes form a dependable
coaching staff. Ed Robertson, Phil

McNemer, and Bob Boyd are the
Huntersville coaches. In spite of the
distance of Huntersville, they are
always ready to work. The Hunters-
ville school is helping out in buy-
ing a set of jerseys for the team.

Good opportunities for students
to serve in a real way, are provided
in this work, and any interested
in helping in the further progress
of the department are requested to
see Dave Anderson.
