Town

from page 1

The town also discussed link-
ing copiers and vending machines
to CAT cards. Terry discussed the

cost involved in hooking up ma-
chines to phone lines.

The College also has a com-
puter consultant looking at install-
ing anew campus wide fiber optics
system. Terry suggested waiting
until that installation and building
from it to save the large start-up
cost.

Some of the Commons issues

discussed were the availability of
food for vegetarians, the back doors
to the Commons being locked, and
the lighting in the dining room
being too dark now that we are no
longer on day light savings time.

Philips was very responsive
to the needs of vegetarians and was
open to any suggestions students
had for new menu items.

Philips said the doors were
locked in order to prevent people

from not using their meal plans,

and eating, which the staff has seen
people do.

Overall, there was a feeling
that there has been a vast improve-
mentin Commons service and will-
ingness to work with the students,

as exemplified by two 99% health
ratings and the new five meal plan.

The final issue discussed was
the availability of laundry machines
throughout the campus. Students
have stated that they will not pay
for new machines because they
feel that their laundry cost in their
tuition should cover this.

The few machines that are on
campus are old machines, given by
the laundry, and are in need of
repair.

Terry stated that the budget
does not allow for the purchase of
new machines, and that only a large
increase in efficiency in the laun-
dry or some other savings plan
would provide the money needed

to purchase new machines.

Still, without more funding or
cost saving measures, it seems that
the students will have to pay for
any new laundry machines placed
on campus.

Gullan said, “The quality of
discussion at these town meetings
continues to be high. Those who
come are really helping the dia-
logue around here.

"And accessible administra-
tors like Richard Terry are willing
to listen; hence the new meal plan
options, which are largely a result
of our new student advisory coun-
cils, and the kind of change enthu-
siastic, ‘committed students can
help affect.”
