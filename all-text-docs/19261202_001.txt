Five Games

The first call for varsity basketball prac-
tice was issued Monday, although a good
many of the men have been out for a week
or so. About 20 men are reporting for daily
practice, among whom are four letter men
from last year: Anderson, Wilson, Harrison,
and Simpson.

“Dutch” Hengeveld is in charge and is at-
tempting to round the men in shape so that
when Coach Monk Younger takes charge he
will find his men well ready for him. It has
been the custom for several years that Dutch
Hengeveld take over the coaching for the
first few weeks.

The Freshmen have not started regular
Practice yet but several Freshmen from the
class team have been working out daily with
the varsity.

The games with the Charlotte Monogram
Club, Charlotte “Y,” and the University of
N. C., are pending, but the schedule as ar-
ranged by Manager Carrol is'as follows:

Dec., 18—Salisbury “Y,” at Davidson.

Tex Tilson to be
Married Saturday

Coach Tex Tilson left Tuesday morning
for Roanoke, Va., where he is to be married
to Miss Virginia Kite, of that city, on Sat-
urday, December 4th. . The announcement of
the wedding came as a comp'ete surprise to
every one with the exception of Coach Monk
Younger, who prophesied the coming event
some time last September.

Immediately after the ceremony the couple
will leave for an extensive tour, which wil
include the state of Texas, and Coach Tex's
home. The trip will be made in the groom's
new Buick coach, which was bought by him
with the purpose of making this trip; but
never did he let even his best friend, Coach
Monk Younger, into the greatest seeret of his
life.

The trip through many of the Southern
States and especially through Texas will e<-
tend over a month and a half. As a result of
this new turn in Tex’s life, we will not have
his services until February. He will return
to Dayidson about the middle of Janury. He
and his bride will stay at one of the town
residences; the exact place of thei-
has not been determined, as yet.

On Tuesday morning Jim Pinkney brought
the matter of the
the purpose of buying a silver service ese!
the married couple and the suggestion was
passed unanimously by the student body.
Bilk Wood and W. L. Lingle were appointed
as a committee to select the silver service to
be donated to the bride and groom. The
football team has also voted to make a gitt
to Coach Tex and his wife. ‘The nature of

keenly curious student body.

Seventeen Players
Are Given Letters

On last Monday night at the meeting of
the Athletic Council, 17 members of thc
1926 Wildcat football team were awarded
letters. Four other members of the squad
were given service letters, making a total
of 21 “D’s” awarded.

Of the 17 men receiving letters, only four
have not received letters in football former-
ly. The other 13 men were all members of
the 1925 squad with the exception of Boggs

The four men receiving letters were Sims,
Ferrel, Christian, and Green. Service letters
are awarded to men that go out for the team
for four straight years, and yet have not
played in a sufficient number of games to
make their “D.” Hence, in return for their
admirable and earnest endeavors, they are
awarded “D’s” in their Senior year. The
awarding of these service letters was origi-
nated this year and will be selected regularly.

At the time of the awarding of letters to
the football players, R. H. McIlwaine will
receive a varsity letter in return for his sery-
ices rendered as football manager. This will
make a total of 22 “D’s” awarded. Of the
| 17 players receiving.letters, nine will be lost
by graduation next year.

The following men received letters: J. F.

The money raised for this fund will go
for the upkeep of Warren Cox, of the class
of ’24, who is now teaching chemistry at
Hangchow Christian College, Hangehow,
China. When Cox graduated from David-
son, this fund was originated to send him to
China to install a department of chemistry
in Hangchow College. His entire expenses
and salary for the last two years have been
paid by the students of Davidson College.
About five hundred dollars is needed for the
support of Cox-in his work in China for the
remainder of this year.

The goal set by the committee in charge
of this drive in one thousand dollars. This
will be an average of about two dollars to a
student, as each Davidson man is expected
to respond to this call. The surplus of this
fund will go to the work of Edgar Tufts, an-
other Davidson man, at Banner Elk, N. C.

know what happened in Durham last Thurs-
day, a day of real Thanksgiving for Da-
vidson? No, there’s no one in the state
does not know what has happened, and there
was no one in Davidson who did not expect
it to happen. And because they did expect |
it, the cynosure of all eyes and the destina-
tion of all legs was Durham.

The great exodus began Wednesday, the
day before the game. A number of Juniors
and Seniors left early in the day, but the
majority of those who left on that day had
to wait till after drill. Then there was a mad
scramble to see who could get the lead in the
“bums’” race. In an incredibly short time
the road to Mooresville was lined with stu-
dents hopefully yelling for a ride. Their
ery was not—“Are you going to Durham?”
for of course everyone was going there. But
it was—‘Have you room for one more?”
And there usually was, for everyone was in-
terested in getting as big a number as possi-
ble to the game.

Duke Holds ’Cats During First Half

Strong Attack

Wildcat stock went over the top last
Thursday during the second half of the an-
nual Duke-Davidson| Turkey Day mixup, .
when Monk Younger’s machine pushed 20
points over the Blue Devils to win, while N.
C. State held Wake Forest to a 7-3 score.
Thereby Davidson clinched the state cham-
pionship.

Through the first half of the Durham
game, anything might have happened. Duke
seemed the most aggressive and made three
first downs by passes. Lefthalf Frank was
tossing the ball where right end Bennett and
quarterback Weaver were receiving, and the
Wildéat defense was conspicuous by its ab-
sence. In this march, four passes were com-
pleted for a total of 35 yards. One drive
was -halted.avhen Weaver went tothe 15-yard
line off" pass, only to be called back because
both teams were off-side. With Duke again
on the 15-yard marker, and the Davidson
line holding, Weaver elected again to pass.
