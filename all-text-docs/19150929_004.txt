The DAVIDSONIAN. September 29, 1915

STATE CONFER! E CONFERENCE

(Concluded from Concluded from page 1) 1)

this game, and Reese’s scoring of 10 out game, and Reese's scoring of 10 out
of a possible 12 fouls was the sensation
of the afternoon. ‘Ihe team was com-
posed of the following men: Forwards,
Carson and Hoyt (Captain); guards,
Reese and Patton; center, Dumas; subs,
McCaskill and Somerville.

Wake Forest challenged Davidson to
a tennis match, two out of three sets in
doubles to decide the winner. ‘T. J.
Mitchell and M. S. Kennedy defended
the Red and Black. and won the first two
sets, 6-4, and 6-3. “They surprised the
conference by their smashing serves and
easy returns. Wake Forest was the fav-|!
orite, but stood absolutely no chance of
winning from the very first serve.

THE RECEPTION.

Friday afternoon at 4:30 p. m. the
Guilford girls entertained the delegates
at a lawn party in front of Founders’
Hall. Decorations of college pennants
added much to the air of festivity, and a
punch bowl presided over by the “Quak-
er Maids” proved exceedingly popular.
Introductions were made through novel
autograph books, in which the boys and
girls exchanged signatures, as souvenirs.
The hospitality of the Y. W. C. A. and
the charm of its members made a lasting
impression on the delegates.

Too much cannot be said in appreci-
ation of the splendid reception and en-
tertainment that was accorded the dele-
gates by the Guilford students, faculty,
and Dr. Newlin, the president. Every-
thing possible was done for their com-
fort and pleasure, and especial thanks
are due to Dr. Newlin, Miss Oshorne,
the matron, and Mr. Harrell Budd,
president of the Guilford Y. M. C. A.

The conference as a whole was one
of the most successful vet held both from
the standpoint of work accomplished and
pleasure enjoyed.

The success of the conference was as-
sured through the services of Mr. FE. G.
Wilson, Mr. Hoke Ramsour, Dr. W.
TD. Weatherford, Dr. W. A. Harper,
Mr. R. W. Barnett, Mr. T. C. Bou-
shall, Mr. J. J. King, Dr. W. L. Poteat
and Dr. N. L. Anderson.

ALUMNI CATALOG.

Miss Hattie Thompson, who has won
the respect and esteem of the whole stu-
dent body by her faithfulness as a vol-
untary organist at all church services,
has begun work on an Alumni Catalog
which will be of interest to all students.
This catalogue is to include not only the
students that have graduated from Dav-
idson and are in” the — serictest sense
alumni, but it is to include the thou-
sands of men who have matriculated
here in the past and have pursued their
studies here for a vear or more. The
students will be taken up in order of
their classes beginning with the found-
ing of the college and ending with the
classes now on the campus. It is to give
not only the addresses and present oc-
cunations of all the former students, but
will state, as far as possible, what, each
of our alumni has accomplished * since
leaving college walls. The work neces-
sarv for the completion of this catalog
will of necessity be very laborious and
we wish Miss Thompson success as she
begins her extensive research, When
completed the catalog is to be published
in book form.

Henry B. Culbrith (1919) was sud-
denly called home on Saturday, Septem-
ber 18, on account of the death of his
father. The sympathy of the entire stu-
dent body is extended in hts sad bereave-
ment.

Judge Shackleford. a member of the
Supreme Court of Florida, came over
from Charlotte in a machine last week
to see the college. among whose alumni
he has several intimate friends.
