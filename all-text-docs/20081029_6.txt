The Grove Park Inn and Spa in Asheville
wraps up our ghostly trip. Architect Fred
Loring Seely designed the Inn and built it in
the Arts and Crafts style.

Construction was completed in 1913 and
guests include those that helped define and
shape America: Thomas Edison, Henry Ford,
F. Scott Fitzgerald and several Presidents.

For the past 50 years, guests and staff
alike have felt the presence of the elusive
“Pink Lady.” Knowledge of her life is sparse,
but she is rumored to have been a hotel guest
in the 1920s, who fell to her death in the
Palm Court Atrium.

The hotel recently conducted an extensive

And, stock up on your

Arts &

study of paranormal activity, and discovered
that room 545 was a hot-spot. Guests who
experience a visit from the Pink Lady typi-
cally describe her as a form of harmless pink
smoke.

For those interested in seeing the Pink
Lady for themselves, hotels.com has deals
for a double-occupancy room starting at
$280 a night in the winter.

The topic of ghosts is always a tricky
subject. There are believers, skeptics and
those who view the legends of these hotels
as simply a fun piece of history. For a price,
it’s possible to go and determine for yourself
what you believe. And if your hopes of see-
ing a spirit don’t live up to the hype, just take
the elevator downstairs and cheer yourself up
with a four-star slice of cake.

LIVING

The Grove Park Inn and Spa in Asheville appears serene and picturesque, but many
guests claim it is haunted by the mysterious “Pink Lady.”

Diwali, from page 5

of the gods through their grace and swiftness.
With over fifty bells decorating each silk cos-
tume-leg, the dancers replicated the sounds
of drums and the ancient poses of the Indian
temples in the dances.

The Diwali celebration finished up with
Indian food, such as somosas and the mango
lassi drink, which consists of mango pulp
mixed with yogurt and traditional lassi ingre-
dients.

Socializing during this time remained
important, as one of the largest aspects about
Diwali is the family and friendship together-
ness during this period.

“Back home, everybody gets together,”
said Vaidya. “It’s nice, you see relatives you
haven’t seen in a while. Diwali has the reli-
gious part to it, but you also celebrate a lot
with family. It’s a lot like Christmas.”

The celebration ended with a single word:
“Namaste,” a common word in India which
essentially means “that which is divine in me
honors that which is divine in you.” So Na-
maste Davidson, and happy Diwali.
