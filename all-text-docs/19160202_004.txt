FAVORABLE OUTLOOK
FOR TRACK SCHEDULE

With the renewed interest in track
and field athletics Davidson should have
a good schedule this spring. “There will
be two meets on the “Hill,” and the
team will probably make one trip. Roy
Perry, the manager, says that Clemson
will probably sign a contract for a meet
here on May 6. The “Tigers” have a
strong team, and the match will be a
good one. Wake Forest asks for a meet
here for either April 29 or May 13. The
contract has not been signed, but the
meet is assured. Here, again, Davidson
will have to work hard to cope with the
Baptists.

It is probable that the team will make
a trip in April. The manager is nego-
tiating with Trinity and A. & M. for
the “off-Hill” meet. The prospect for
a strong team is good, Coach Kluttz is
to have charge of these teams, and prac-
tice will begin in a short time.

GOLF CLUB NEWS.

The recently elected officers of the
Golf Club are: Dr. J. M. McConnell,
president; Prof. W. W. Wood, treas-
urer; and J. H. Carson, secretary, who
are ‘planning many improvements in the
course. The fairways will be werked
over and several new traps will be made,
one or two of the badly situated bunkers
having been closed. On this improved
course the annual spring handicap tour-
nament of the club will be held id

March. This should be a lively affair,! K

since the weather this winter has been
exceptionally good for golfing. Along
with this tournament among ourselves
the club is also endeavoring to get a pro-
fessional connected with the Wright &
Ditson Co. to come here to play an ex-
hibition game.

er of these halls will be completed until

GYM TEAM ITEMS.

As most of the members of the Gym
Team are playing class foot ball, regular
practice for the exhibition at Junior
Speaking has not begun yet. The team
expects to try some new stunts when
practice begins, and several new men
are needed. After Junior Speaking the
team expects to make an extensive trip,
giving exhibitions, but no definite plans
have as yet been made. At a_ recent
meeting of the team, P. B. Price was
elected manager,

WITH OTHER COLLEGES.

Columbia University—The Columbia
Spectator is now a daily visitor to the
exchange table of THe Davipsonian.
The Spectator is one of the leading daily
papers of the large Universities of the
United States. The coaches of the Var-
sity rowing crews have already sent let-
ters to those who will compete for places
on the team warning them lest they be-
come ineligible by failing in their ex-
aminations which are now in progress.

Ihe DAVIDSONIAN, February 2, 1916 ;

Columbia is a strong rival of Harvard,
Yale, and Princeton, in the inter-col-
legiate rowing contests which are held
each year in June.

University of Virginia—A bill to
make the University of Virginia a co-
ordinate college is now being considered
by the Legislature of Virginia, and it
seems that the bill will have a majority
in that body. In the meanwhile the stu-
dents of the University are making a de-
termined fight against the passage of the
bill. They believe that it will destroy.
in great measure, the efficiency of the
University, that it will alienate the de-
votion of many of the alumni and that
it will result in great detriment to the
cause of higher education in Virginia.

goals, and himself scored five. Con-
cerning the game, the Winston-Salem
Journal says, in part: “The ‘Davidson
spirit’ was in evidence and the fight that
is always characteristic of Davidson
teams. Their spirit concerning decisions
that were against them was magnificent.
and no cleaner or finer team has ever
played on a local floor. The people of
Winston-Salem are always glad to hav:
Davidson men here because of this gen-
tleman-like spirit which is never absent.”
