the performance was a professional exhibition which gave
them the right to work the show. Queens giris contended that
the program was only for the benefit of the college as it

Library To Remain
Open On Sunday

The library quietly opened
its doors to students all Sun-
day night in what is anticipated
to be a permanent move.

Before the current year, the
library closed at 5 and opened
again at 8:30 p. m., in defer-
ence to the now defunct ves-
pers service.

Student agitation began sever-
al weeks ago to keep the build-
ing open for student use for the
entire night. Last week the Stu-
dent Council voted to support
a move to keep the library open.

Last week's opening came as
a surprise to most students,
with no advance notice or pub-
licity from the library staff.

Faculty Adopts Rules
Approved By Council

New traffic regulations ap-
proved by the Student Council
Monday night have been adopt-
ed almost fully by the faculty
Traffic Committee.

The regulations include a $10
fine for speeding, an envelope
payment system for fines, and
impounding of a car on the fifth
violation during a semester.

Although the faculty did not
meet formally, they were polled
individually by Jim Terry. as-

sistant dean of students, and
gave their approval. The poll
was taken Wednesday about the
decisions reached at Monday
night's Student Council meeting.

Bill Watson, reporting for a
Student Council traffic commit-
tee. said that the faculty showed
little enthusiasm over the com-
plicated point system forwarded
by the council last year. In-
stead, the faculty countered with
a program similar to the pres-

Anti-Anti-‘Dixie’ Forces
Mount Petition Offense

By FRANKLIN ANDERSON
Staff Writer

“What's wrong with ‘Dixie'?”
demands a petition on a door in
East Dormitory, and 224 students:
have agreed with its answer
that ‘It’s a damn good song!”

The petition went up in re-
sponse to Athletic Director Tom
Scott’s request: Dr. Scott and
two members of the Faculty
Athletic Committee suggested
the removal of ‘Dixie’ last week
after complaints about the song’s
racial overtones.

Dr. Scott said that since the
news came out about the song's

exclusion, he had received four
letters, one favoring the move
and three opposing it.

“We did not tell them (the
band) not to play it. There has
been no edict,”’ emphasized Dr.
Scott when the dropping of
“Dixie” was referred to as a
“policy.” “It was only a sug-
gestion.”

‘But,’ said Dave Hoag. direc-
tor of the band, ‘‘you just don't
ignore faculty opinions. For the
time being, I'm just waiting,”
he said.

A poll by THE DAVIDSONIAN
showed 90 per cent of those poll-
ed to be against the dropping of
“D'xie.”’ They were asked, ‘Do

you approve of the dropping of
‘Dixie’ by the Wildcat Band in
response to Athletic Department
requests?”

‘‘Northerners cheer just as
much for ‘Dixie’ as Southern-
ers,’ said Dan Vinson, a band
member. ‘I've been up north a
lot and I've seen them cheer.”

The Charlotte Obesrver quoted
one of the college's Negro stu-
dents as saying that ‘Dixie’
didn’t offend him, but that it
disturbed some prospective Ne-
gro students he took to a foot-
ball game with him.

On the other side, two Negro
students signed the petition for
restoring ‘‘Dixie.”

ent fining system with certain
favorable proposals.

The faculty suggested a grad-
uated ticket scale of a $1 fine
for the first offense, $3 for the
second, $5 for the third, $7 for
the fourth. and the car would be
impounded with the fifth of-
fense. The scale would be set
up on a one-semester basis.

Also included in the faculty
suggestions was a proposal that
money raised through the fines
would be turned over to the So-
cial Council, but this was not
approved by the faculty when
the plan was returned. The fac-
ulty further proposed an enve-
lope system, giving violators an
opportunity to pay without hav-
ing to attend traffic court dur-
ing Friday chapel period.

The keeping of court records

is to be handled by students and

not the bursar's office as in the
past, according to the faculty
proposals.

Elaborating on the: envelope
system, Watson said that of-
fenders can pay for their fines

any time during the week by !

placing the ticket and a check
for the amount specified in a
special envelope located near
the office of the assistant dean
of students (Room 107). The en-
velope will then be put in the
mail slot of Terry's office. A
cancelled check will serve as
the student's receipt.

tal worship services, with the
first service set for 7 p.m. Wed-
nesday in Lingle Chapel.

Aft the end of the two-month
period, the Religious Life Com-

whether or not to continue it as
a means of fulfilling the col-
lege’s retigious commitment.

According to the Rev. Will

into the services. Local clergy

.and faculty will fill the pulpit

for most of the services, but
“two outside men” are also to
speak.

Students To Voice
Liberal Position

A new student organization designed to ‘‘create a
liberal student voice on campus” began collecting names
of both students and professors this week in a prelude
to seeking a charter from the Student Council.

Leaders of the group, called the Committee for Stu-
dent Action (CSA), expect to submit their membership
list and statement of purpose to the council sometime
this month, perhaps in time for consideration at Mon-

day's meeting.

Council approval of charters is routine, according to
President Chuck Matthews, and the chartering of the CSA

is virtually assured.

LESS MONEY ASKED

Tutors For Athletes
Called Normal Policy

The Athletic. Department has
been providing tutors for athletes
with academic difficulties. a
practice that is several years
old, Athletic Director Tom Scott
told THE DAVIDSONIAN this
week.

The practice came to Hght
when a football player seeking
a tutor in French asked the pro-

spective tutor to see Dave Fagg,
assistant football coach. The

athlete also told the tutor that

Fagg wanted a record of the
time spent in tutoring.

When first asked about the
matter, Fagg asked ‘“‘What con-

cern is it?” thinking that this
practice was familiar to David
son students. He then left for
a moment to speak with John
Kilgo, sports information direc-
tor,

After his return Fagg stat-
ed. that tutoring paid for by the
athletic department is an esta-
blished practice. He added that
he himself was provided tutori-
al aid as a student at David-
son.

Scott provided particulars
concerning tutorial aid. He said
that it has ‘‘dropped off in past
years” and that ‘‘both coaches
(football and basketball) have
requested a reduced budget” in
this area. Two athletes received
such aid last semester, and a
total of $145 was spent.

The CSA, which organizer Dan
Mombtea calls ‘simply a fed-
eration of four liberal move-
ménts on campus.” will direct
its attention to both campus and
national issues. Its four-pronged.
Statement of purpose includes
stands on academic freedom.
civil rights, poverty, and mili-.
tarism, including ROTC.

Already five professors—Phil-
ip B. Secor, Norman Johnson.
Hansford Epes, Max Polley, and
Anthony Abbott — have signed
the petition, thereby agreeing to
serve on a board of faculty ad-
visers.

The CSA is, according to its
statement of purpose. ‘“‘an or-
ganization of Davidson students
who believe that reai progress
will not come to the South un-
less those who are currently in
college begin to deal with the
fundamental contradictions of
our society in a way which is
genuine and lasting.”

It will be broken down into
four autonomous committees,
each one dealing with one of the
four specific tenets expressed in
the statement of purpose:

—"To increase student aca-
demic freedom and contribute to
an intellectual atmosphere on
campus.” According to Mom-
brea, this committee would aim
for ‘‘more dialogue’ between
student and faculty and perhaps
another independent student lit-
erary publication.

—To promote the civil rights
movement by group encourage-
ment and individual involve-
ment.’ “I doubt that would in-
clude demonstration — the time
for that has passed.’” Mombrea
said. ‘‘It would be more in the
line of practical application of
laws that have already been
passed, such as in voter regis-
tration.”

—''To attem aid the pov-
erty-stricken, /emphasizing the
socio-edutational aspects of this

problem.’ This committee,
Mombrea said, would be inter-
ested in tutoring and furthering
people’s desire for a better
life.

—'To continually protest the
present ROTC graduation re-
quirement and U. S. foreign
policy of military intervention
in the affairs of other nations
especially as seen in Viet Nam”
by sponsoring debates and dis-
cussions on the topic.

He said ‘the CSA itself would
serve merely as a ‘clearing
house’ for its four indepen-
dent committees. “To join, you

‘| only have to agree with one spe-

cific group.”

In the ROTC protest, Mombrea
“weekly demonstra-
tions. We plan to resurrect
the Peon army.”

Mombrea has been the mov-
ing force in this fall’s organ-
izing, although the idea was
first conceived and set in mo-

‘|tion last spring by Jack Wood-
all,
“! Europe.

a junior now studying in

Woodall and 13 others partic-
ipated in an anti-Viet Nam
war march in Washington, D.
C., last spring, and, according
to Mombrea, later held a few
meetings to determine ‘a rough
idea of our goals."'

Over the summer, Mombrea
drafted the statement of pur-
pose, and the petition to the
Student Council was first cir-
culated on campus Monday.
