Continued from page 6

Davidsonian: Some people be-
lieve that the Admissions Office
accepts minorities to Davidson as
tokens rather than as people. What
do you think, and what would you

do to combat this problem?

Summers: I think it’s an issue we
need to examine. When you have
someone coming from overseas to
aplace like Davidson, you need to
have some sort of structured sup-
port.

» That support can’t just come
from other international students,
but from the entire student body.

African American students are
too muchin the minority rightnow,
and the SGA has really got to get
into it and make some judgments.
The support isn’t there right now,
and that needs to change. ©

Davidsonian: Why has the SGA
rolled over regarding minus grades
and shortened exam schedules?
What can you do to prevent this

type of complacency from the stu-
dent government?

Summers: I don’t know why the
SGA hasn’t been involved in it. I
can tell you that what really needs
to happen is that the new SGA
president and his staff down the
line have got to take this thing very
seriously.

Whether that means ruffling

the feathers of the administration
and the trustees, I think that the
student body is what counts here.

If you get the students behind
the SGA and you take something
to the trustees, I guarantee you that
the trustees will listen very closely.

If you have one or two people
working very hard, but without the
support of the students, I don’t
think you’ Il geta lot accomplished.

- Reinertsen

In running for the President of

. the Union, I, Jessica Reinertsen,
hope to become not only a part but
aleader in the organization to which
eachandevery studentof Davidson
belongs. Whether you have gone
to an Artist’s Series production or
just rented a movie from the game

room, you have participated in an,

activity, designed for you by the
students which make up the Union
Board. As a freshman, I was only
peripherally aware of Union events
and the amount of planning that
went into them. Like most stu-
dents, I let myself be satisfied with
just walking through the Union
before aclass to geta Coke. Luck-
ily, my work/study as a reception-
ist at the: Union desk introduced
me to the staff and the students
which made the Union comealive.

In the’spring of my freshman

year, I applied fora position on the -

Union Board and was privileged to
be selected as Secretary for the
Board. Though I did not have a
committee of my own, I main-
tained communication between
members of the Board and the
faculty advisors, took minutes at
all the Board meetings and acted as
aide tothe president. Also through
my position, I was appointed to the
Policy Committee which made
amendments to the bylaws of the
Union and created a new budget
for the board each year. As a part
of this committee, I passed the
amendments and gave the money
to start the movie rental service in
the game room, purchase new
speakers allowing better sound
quality atconcertsin the 900 Room
and set up a $5,000 reserve fund
for large concerts in Baker Sports

Complex. Also, I enjoyed serving’

on several committees and watch-
ing our programing become real-
ity.
Though I have not been on the
_ Union Board this past year, I have

maintained the high interest level -

in the Union that was sparked my
freshman year. By having achance

Candidates for the Union Presidency

to view Union programing as a
simply a Davidson student and not
a Board member, I have come to
greater appreciate all that the Un-
ion does for this campus. As presi-
dent, I hope to bring my enthusi-
asm about the Union to all stu-
dents. We all pay an activity fee,
and we should all feel that the
Union has something to offer us.
Everyone should feel as if they are
a part owner of the Union; they
should be able to walk in, sit down
and be themsélves. If elected, I
hope begin a campus wide calen-
der which would be distributed
approximately each week to in-
form students of upcoming events
in the Union and all other facets of
Davidson life. Such a calender
would prevent students from miss-
ing out on the various opportuni-
ties Davidson has to offer. I started
a Union calender when I was sec-
retary, but I think a new calender
should include other events to give
Davidson students the whole pic-
ture of Davidson, not just one
portion.

The Union maintains excite-
merit because it has Endless possi-
bilities. “As president, I hope to
directly initiate programming such
as a future Outdoor Reggae Festi-
val and.to choose and lead a Union
Board under which the Union will
excel. Please give me the chance
to make to Union a part of your
Davidson experience.

Davidsonian: What do you see as
the Union’s place in the social life
“of the college?

Reinertsen:.Idon’t thinkit’s good
to see the Union as an alternative to
Patterson Court, because there are
so many different things going on.
When you walk through the build-
ing, you’re experiencing Union
programming.

I think that on this calendar I
was talking about, we could list
Patterson Court events there as

- well, so that students can see that
they don’t conflict with Union
events--you don’t have to choose
one or the other.

Davidsonian: Would you give us
a brief list of the leadership roles
you’ve played on campus up to
this point?

Reinertsen: I’vebeenonthe Union
Board before, I was secretary when
I was a freshman. I was an aide to
the president, and I worked with
the faculty advisors. I took min-
utes at all the meetings, and made
sure that those who weren’t there

wereinformedas to what was going .

on.

Themostimportantthing about
that position was that I was on the
Policy Committee, and that was

really a leadership position. We
did the entire budget, we edited the
entire by-laws, and basically, we
OKed what went to the board.

I’vealso been the Historian for
Warner Hall, and I’m a junior-at-
large in Warner Hall.

Davidsonian: Why did you de-
cide not to be a part of the Union
Board this past year?

Reinertsen: When I was on the
Board, I was socaught up init, that
‘I wasn’t sure what I wanted todo in
the coming year. It was basically
my own fault in that I let it pass me
by.

See ;
Ann Todd.

Idon’t wantto waste time with
jokes or flowery speech, so I will

‘ come right to the pointand say, my

name is Ann Todd and I want to be
the next President of the Union
Board. This decision is neither

. whimsical nor last minute; I have

been seriously considering this
position for several months.

I have two strong reasons for
running. Number one, I know the
Union; I have been an active
member of the Union Board since
my sophomore year anda member
of the Chamber Music, Artist Se-
ries and Video committees since
my freshman year. From my expe-
rience on the Board, I have learned
what works and what does not. I
know the policy and organization
of the Union and would enter with
the experience I feel is necessary
to run an efficient and productive
Union.

Secondly, I am touch with
many different facets of the col-
lege and the town and as President
I would hope to reach as many dif-
ferent groups as possible. Inde-
pendents, Patterson Court Mem-
bers, and those of usin between are
all vital to the diverse community
we are a part of. The Union Board
must represent this diverse popu-
lation and seek to provide pro-
gramming for all. In selecting a
Union Board I will work to ensure
that the entire campus is repre-

sented. Diversity is a priority; and
I hope to use this diversity in cre-
ating a solid board with the goal of
“Everyone’s Union” in mind.

The Union is not just an alter-
Native to Patterson Court but a
central point at which the entire
campus may join. I have the drive,
the commitment and the know-
how to make the Union the best it
can be

Davidsonian: You've been the
chair of the Chamber Music Com-
mittee over the past year, and
you’ ve gotten a chance to see how
the past president has run things.
How would your presidency re-
semble and differ from her ad-
ministration?

Todd: I’ve really enjoyed being
on the Board this year, and it’s
been a really good experience for
me.

The major problem, in my
opinion, is that the Union is so
large. Because itis so big, itis hard
to get people to work at functions-
-everyone assumes that someone
else is going to do it. It’s a good
group of people, but I think every-
one always assumed thatthere was
going to be someone else.

I would like to have a smaller
Union Board. In that way, we
would be more unified, and it would
be easier to join together to get
things done.

Davidsonian: Tofollow up, would
you not allow co-chairs of com-
mittees?

Todd: Some of the larger commit-
tees need co-chairs, but not all. I
know Chamber Music only needs
one chair, and that’s true foralotof
different committees. .

Davidsonian: We've asked sev-
eral of the SGA candidates about
theproblems, racial et cetera, which
have plagued our campus.

How do you see the Union
working with the SGA? The or-
ganizations have been pretty de-
tached from one another this year.

Todd: As president, I would like
to bring YSSC [Reach Out] into
the Union a little bit more, and to
do more things jointly. We have
the manpower in the Union, and
the money, and I think that we
could do more joint programming.

Because we are seen by every-
one on the campus, we have great
way to reach out to many different

people.

I am Beth Willard and I want
to be the next Union Board Presi-
dent. I hope after reading the next
few paragraphs you will under-
stand why.

My freshman (spring)/sopho-
more (fall) year I served on the
Union Board as the Historian and I
cannot begin to express how much
that Union experience meant to
me. As part of my Historian duties
Iattended all events, took pictures,
and kept a pictorial and verbal
record of these events’in a scrap-
book.

« During this time, I had the op-
portunity to work with and ob-
serve all committees of the Union.
Through this, I not only gained
exposure to the Board, but I also
co-planned a major event in the
fall of ‘90--The Folk Festival. The
process of planning the Folk Festi-
val enabled me to work closely
withalarge number and wide vari-
ety of people including faculty,
students and. members of the
Davidson community.

Also, as an active member of
the Women’s Concerns Commit-
tee, I was able to participate in the
Union in a capacity that differed
from my Board duties.

My involvement with the
Union enlightened me to a part of
campus life that I had not bothered
to take advantage of earlier, and it
Jeft me witha need to stay a part of
this life. For the past year, I have
been abroad, and now I. am back
ready to pick up where I left off.
The Union, as an entity, is very
important to me and one I would
like to keep being a part of. Ihave
lots of energy I want to devote to
the Union as well as a desire to be
a part of all its happenings. I feel
confident I can do a great job as
Union President, and all I need
now is your vote.

duced freshpeople to the Union

during orientation, I told them,
