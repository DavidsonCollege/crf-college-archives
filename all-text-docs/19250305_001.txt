Professor Wachter Will -

Have Artists in Recital

Mr. Neal and Mrs. Baker of Char-
lotte to Assist in the Kipling
Recital

Professor Carl Wachter, Mr. Will Neal,
and Mrs. Coral Hayner Baker will present
a special program for the benefit of The
Davidsonian on Friday evening, March 20,
at Shearer Hall. It is quite a pleasure to
those sponsoring this entertainment to an-

nounce the appearance of such talented
artists.
Professor Wachter, lately of Richmond

University, is now an instructor in English
and Public Speaking at Davidson, and has
already proven his ability to handle parts
such as he will take in this entertainment.
His likable nature and ready wit have made
him unusually popular with the students, and
as a public speaker he is even more of a
favorite.

Mr. Neal is a talented baritone, and is
quite prominent in musical circles throughout
the Carolinas. He graduated from Davidson
in 1917, where he had been a great asset to
the musical organizations, and had first en-
tertained audiences with his delightful per-
sonality and his rich, baritone voice. For
the past five years he has studied with Mrs.
Baker, and has developed into an accom-
plished soloist. He is an artist in his inter-
pretation and his diction is also’ of high
order.

Mrs. Baker's work in directing the Glee
Club needs no comment, and she will be en-
thusiastically welcomed when she makes her
appearance in Shearer Hall on Friday even-
ing, March 20.

The purpose of The Davidsonian in ar-
ranging this program is to provide a high-
class entertainment for’ the students and
townspeople and at the same time give them
an opportunity of supporting their paper, in
order that it may end the year free from any |

debt such as was overhangng the present | | winners of the sem-finals meet a week later. |
