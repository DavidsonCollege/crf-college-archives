Larry Graham, high scoring ace
of the Catawbas.

When asked to comment on the
game, Baird replied, “All I know
is that they will wear blue jerseys
so we'll wear our, white uniforms.
We had a pretty good scrimmage
with Cramerton Mills Monday
night and the boys looked okay
except for a few spots on defense.
Catawba is always a hard ‘bunch to

thing to happen and hope we can

members would donate blood to
the drive, and Shelton’s Boarding
house is giving a steak dinner to
all donors who board at that house.

It is hoped by the PMS&T that
many of the other fraternities of
the campus witl also pledge 100
per cent donations. At the ROTC
drill this past Tuesday the PMS&T
announced that a worthwhile reward
will be given to those units having
the most members to donate blood
in the campaign.

made to shoulder the criticism.
Why should the praise be given
to the paper, while criticism is
pushed off on the individuals? I
understand a paper's first responsi-
bility is to stand behind its writers

on the staff.

It is often apparent you are
straining -to find material to write
about. Why not come down off the
superficial level? Take the pulse
of the student body on basic is-
sues; look in your own hackyard
and I predict you will find it alive
with newsworthy material.

really hate Russia and eager to
fight the Communists who were
such wholly evil people.
