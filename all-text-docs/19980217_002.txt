Pnivorsity of Kentithy professor Dr. George Herring discusses “The War That Seems to Never Go Away”

~ By Moran Downer

In spite of the entertainment of a
basketball game and the Winter Olym-
pics, nearly every seat in Chambers
Gallery was filled when Dr. George
Herring, a professor of history at the
University of Kentucky, spoke about
the'impact of the Vietnam War on the
United States. The audience mutely
echoed the theme of his discourse: The
War That Seems to Never Go Away.

In fact, he pointed out, Vietnam
has haunted our view of ourselves as a
nation, as well as tempered our foreign
policy initiatives.

In March 1991, Herring began,
with the military success of Desert
Storm, former President George Bush
triumphantly announced that “the ghost
of Vietnam had been laid to rest beneath
the sands of the Arabian desert.”

Large numbers of troops had
landed on foreign soil and achieved a
smashing victory. Signs proclaiming
““Traq’ is Arabic for ‘Vietnam’” had all
but disappeared. The Nation stood
united behind the war effort.

Yet just days before his proud proc-

* lamation, Bush had refused to send the

armies on to Baghdad for total victory,
in part for fear of being entrapped in a
political and diplomatic quagmire.
Debates over possible U.S. interven-
tion in Haiti and Bosnia in 1993 and
“94, as well as a disastrous involvement
in Somalia in 1993, recalled the very
ghost that Bush claimed to have buried.

Even now, the nations of the world
shrink from the possibility of returning
to war with Iraq.

Americans clearly have not for-
gotten.

The question Herring addressed
was, Why the war is still here? Why it
is so pervasive and lasting? Why, after

20 years, does it still have so much-

influence on our nation?

First, Herring stated, Vietnam was
America’s longest war. The U.S.’s
direct involvement spanned a quarter of
a century, and the U.S. did not normal-
ize relations with Vietnam until 1995,
under President Bill Clinton. Techni-
cally, the Vietnam War-was not dead
when Bush declared the disposal of its
ghost.

Also, fighting the war itself was
extremely difficult and peculiarly frus-

trating. The heat in the mountainous
jungle “could killa man, bake his brains,
ring the sweat from him until he died of
exhaustion,” a lieutenant had remem-
beréd. Americans also had suffered due
to the language and cultural gap be-
tween themselves and the Vietnamese.
It was hard to tell friend from foe.

Perhaps the worst predicament for
the soldiers was the formless yet lethal
nature of guerrilla warfare. There were
no fixed objectives or clear battle lines.
One quarter of the casualties came from
mines and ‘booby-traps.

The mood at home was unfortu-
nately equally frustrating, Herring con-
tinued. While protests of war were not
uncommon in the U.S., the country dur-
ing the war was also in the midst of
social upheaval, in which all of the old
values and institutions were being ques-
tioned and challenged. And in the face
of a growing opposition to Vietnam,
neither the Johnson nor Nixon Admin-
istrations could make a compelling ar-
gument that the war was just or neces-
sary in terms of national security. Wea-
riness of the war at home and abroad
then spurred’a desire to get out of it, no
matter what the consequence.

Yet the end of the war proved both
traumatic and bitter. The U.S. did not
lose. It withdrew. In effect, the U.S.
quit. This was difficult to explain or
accept, and when South Vietnam then
rapidly collapsed, the question, What
was it all for? was asked. What did they
all die for?

Where was the ideal, the philoso-
phy?

This war, Herring asserted, caused
the nation to confront its beliefs about
the U.S. and the American character.

The idea of “American
exceptionalism” was founded on the
belief in “American benevolence” that
holds that the nation has acted kindly
and generously to other nations, never
using violence if pressed. As the myth
crumbled, Americans began to perceive
and actively look for evil in America’s
past. Americans wanted to abandon all
myth, even though its purpose is in-
struction, not factual truth.

The idea of “American invincibil-
ity” was also badly shaken. The U.S.
looked for excuses, for reasons why it
could not beat a “second-rate” country.
Americans evén attempted to convince
themselves that they could have won if

they had really wanted to.

“ But whether people blamed the
antiwar media, the timid leadership, or
the restrictions imposed by Johnson
(who held back a full military effort in
favor of a strategy of pressuring the
enemy accept a divided the country),
the results were still there, unchange-
able.

The war will never end, Herring
concluded, until the memory of those
results have been erased by time, until
the generation that fought and opposed
Vietnam has passed on.

The men and women of that gen-
eration, as well as students, then began
to offer comments and ask questions.
One after the other raised a hand and
began with, “I ama Vietnam Veteran.”

Colonel Quincy Collins, an Air
Force pilot and a Prisoner of War for
seven years, spoke of the feelings of
honor and patriotism mixed with disil-
lusionment and the horror of war. “‘I
believed in what I was doing,” he said,
“and I clung to that belief for the sake of
my own:psyche. (I later) realized that
the Department of Defense and the gov-
ernment of the United States don’t al-
ways tell the truth.”

Americorps encourages students to become more active

Have you ever wondered what really hap-
pens in the Davidson community? Americorp and
the Bonner Foundation are offering an opportu-
nity to find out with the Americorp Leaders Pro-
gram, what Community Service Coordinator Bill
Abrams said will “get (students) in deeper into the

community.”

The year-and-a-half long program will begin
this summer and will continue until the end of the
next summer. During this time, a maximum of 20
participants will perform 900 hours of community
service for a grant of $2,362.50 from the federal
government.

The program will be broken up into three
phases, one during each summer and one during

the school year, each of which requires 300 hours
of service. Two hundred fifty hours will be spent
on direct service, while 50 will be spent on reflec-
tion and leadership training.

Abrams said that the programs is “designed
so students already doing the work can get more
money” because some of the students were having
trouble financing their educations. In fact, many
students, including Bonner scholars and -federal
work study students, are already completing a
majority of the required hours. Also, Pittard said
that_there are already “people here with the same
attitude” that the program seeks to create.

Despite the grant, the money is not the pri-
mary issue. Associate Dean of Community Ser-

- vice & International Student Programs Ruth Pittard

said that the students would be “doing it (the
service) for a love of what they’re doing.”

A group of 20 participants, from the commu-
nity as well as the College, will serve as staff for
programs that cannot afford to hire additional
help.

Instead of completing what ‘Abrams and
Pittard-believe to be the important but peripheral
work that requires little long-term commitment,
the participants will work in the running of the
program and gain a more thorough understanding
of what occurs. The work will involve policy
making, volunteer training, research, connections
with national organizations, and needs assess-
ment. Abrams said that the participants will com-
plete “ a different genre of work.”

Participants will choose from 20-30 intern-
ships chosen by the College, but the internships
will not be limited to these choices. Everything is
still in the planning phases, but Pittard and Abrams
plan to offer internships at organizations such as
the Davidson Housing Coalition, the Ada Jenkins
Center, and the Davidson Youth Activity Center.
Pittard said that they “encourage people to look at
your individual passions, spiritual base you oper-
ate from, what your views of yourself and your
own life are,” and to choose service work relating

to these beliefs.

No matter what the participants choose to do,
Abrams said that the work will be “focusing onthe *
immediate community” and “building ties in
Davidson,”: not Cornelius, Huntersville, or the
surrounding areas. Pittard added that the program
is a “wonderful way to get to know community in
which you live ina way which is not open to every
student.”

Abrams and Pittard said that the program is
“open to anyone willing to do the work” who
needs money for his or her education. Of the
maximum 20 participants, they hope to have ap-
proximately 15 Davidson students and five com-
munity members. The community members could
be high school students or anyone who has educa-
tional expenses. Abrams wants to include com-
munity members because they are “looking for
diversity in the group.” The Davidson students
should be current freshmen, sophomores, or jun-
iors who are willing to remain after graduation.
Anyone who is interested should contact Abrams

‘as soon as possible.

If the program is successful, Pittard said, “it
will presumably happen again.” The program’s
renewal does depend upon political circumstances
because the Corporation for National Service, the
parent organization of Americorp, is one of Presi-
dent Clinton’s programs.

Pittard and Abrams are optimistic about the
effect the program will have upon the community.
Abrams feels that the program “will encourage
ties between the student body at the college and the
community” as well as “strengthen (existing)
bonds.” Pittard hopes that “it will part of the
process and the solution” of helping the commu-
nity heal after the Christmas Day shooting, al-
though it is “not the solution.” She feels that it will
increase the cooperation that already exists be-
tween the college and the community. As Abrams
said, the program “ties into the mission of the
College, to prepare students for meaningful lives
of leadership and service.”
