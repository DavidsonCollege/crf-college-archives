With. the departure of C.
David Cornell as’ vice-
president for finance and
development, the financial
structure of Davidson College
will undergo the process of
reorganization.

College President Samuel
R. Spencer Jr. indicated that
he would seek two men to
_Teplace Cornell, citing the ad-
vantages of having finance
and development under
separate heads.

“The position requiring one
person to supervise both the
financial and the developmen-
tal aspects of the college had
grown to be too much respon-

sibility for one person,” Spen-
cer noted.

Spencer was quick to em-~

phasize that the:combining of
the two jobs several years agc

had been an experiment. He —

felt that the rationale for the
trial had been justified and
that the results had proven it'a
good possibility.

“I think that the per-
formances made under the
system have indicated that it
was a worth:hilc venture,”
Spencer sa... But I also feel
that the liabilities were
evident.”

The new system will have
one person as the designated
director of development and
another as supervisor of the

“I would prefer to have a

New Union Set To Open In January,
Board Optimistic For Year’s Programs

The old Hugh and Jane
Parks Grey Library is
scheduled to open as the newly
rennovated College Union
January 1, 1975, according to
Director of the College Union
_C. Shaw Smith.

“‘We are looking for a Jan. 1
completion date. We feel this
is a realistic date, but it is not
a promise,”’ said Smith.

“T’m real excited about
the possibilities,’ he added.
“This gives -us—a-far better
programming range than
what we had dreamed.’’

But the Union has not been
idly awaiting the opening of its
new facilities.

“During the summer, your
Union was working hard to
pull together what looks to be
an exciting year. The entire
staff of the Davidson College
Union wants to welcome you
back to campus and hopes.that
you too will feel that we have a
tremendous year coming up,”’
said President of the College
Union Frazier Marsh.

Beginning Monday, and run-

ning every Monday thereafter
until Oct. 28, the Union will be
presenting the ‘Ascent of
Man”’ series. This is a much
acclaimed film series written
for B.B.C. by Dr. Jacob
Bronowski, a renowned math-
matician, biologist, teacher,
author, poet, philosopher, and
historian.
_ The films, first shown in the
United States at the
Smithsomian Institute, trace
the intellectual and emotional
evolution of ‘man from
prehistoric to modern times.

On ber. 28 in Love

will present a poetry concert.

out North and South Carolina

claim.

“The sounds of music and
the words’ of poetry com-
plement and expand each
other,’’ said Barbara Brawley
of the Charlotte Observer.

After much negotiation and
hard work, the Union is able tc.
present a new concept in en-
tertainment on the Davidson
Coliege campus with Viveca
Lindsfors performing in “I
Am a Woman”’ on Cct. 8.

This is a dramatic presen-
ation in which Lindsfors por-
rays in a sense,

- anges from a 13 year old Viet-

namese girl, brutalized by the
war, to a frustrated Marilyn
Monroe expressing her desire
to be more than a sex goddess,
to a portrayal of Mrs. Charles
Manson.

Lindsfors is a type of
feminist, but more than that,
she is a person able to present,
through dramatic. expression,
.he trials of both women and
men through history, Marsh
indicated.

On Oct. 12 at 8 p.m. in Love
Auditorium, Jerry Rockford
will present “Edv Allen
Poe--A Condition of Shadow. i
Through Poe’s writings, Rock-
ford will portray an in-depth
characterizatio:, ut the poet.

“This is an exciting, new
type of drama, being neither a
reading nor a play in the
traditional sense,’’ Marsh
said.’ _ , .

Rockwood has won the Bar-
ter Theater Award for acting,
has performed with several
tourmg companies including
the. National Company of
‘‘Teahouse of the August
Moon,” and is_author of the
text, ‘‘The Craftsman of

ting. ”

Homecoming weekend
begins Friday, Oct. 25, with a

opening concert by Kan-
sas. “Cashbox” said, “Look
for Kansas to become one of
the biggest rock groups of
"74. . .They are anorganization

which truly deserves over-
whelming success.”’
Saturday night, Larry
Coryell, acclaimed as one of
the greatest electric jazz
guitarists in the United States,
will be playing in Johnston
Gymnasium at8 p.m.

This is the first concert

scheduled in the gym with the

new acoustical engineering.
“This concert will

provide a precedent for Nhe

concerts, as the gym will

provide a more ‘concert-like’

atmosphere,” said Marsh.

As yet, the daytime ac-
tivities for Homecoming ’74
have not beem formally
programmed.

Sonny Terry and Brownie
McGee will be in. Love

On Nov. 15 and 16, the
Davidson College Union will

he is the one who carries the

Spencer also indicated that

-some restructuring. of. the of-

fice for academic and student
affairs might be forth-
coming.

“This. is now under
discussion, and it is possibile
that we- may move on this
during this year,’’-.Spencer
said.

_ He indicated that any such
move would come “with the
acquiescence and recom-
mendation”’ of Bevan. ;

Cornell resigned during the
summer to take a job as direc-
tor of fund-raising for a:career

' service program at California

Polytechnic State University.

Spencer said that the search
was on for successors to Cor-
nell. He expressed hopes that
the project would be ‘com-
pleted within a few months.

As for the present, Spencer
indicated thats the slack in
fund raising would be picked
up by the heads of the
numerous subdivisions under .
each of the areas of finance
and development.

“Certainly the college will
suffer financially to some
degree,’”” Spencer admitted.
“But the many people in-
volved in the various areas of
work will continue their good
productions, while there are
several things we have going
now that I will give my per-
sonal attention to.”’ .

Both Spencer and Bevan
noted that the separation of
development and finance had
been recommended by the
recent Faculty Self- Study.
which should be made public
in the near future.

Several other staff mem-
bers have left Davidson for
other institutions. Don Win-
ston, w ded the develop-
ment ar der. Cornell, had
resigned prior to the close of
the past academic year to ac-
cept a position at Southern
California.

Russel Strong, former direc-
tor of public information at
Davidson, is now the head of
that department at Wake
Forest University.

Bevan indicated that
