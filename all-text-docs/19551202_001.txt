Council Takes Action on
Parking Rules, Parties

By JOHN TRASK, JR.
At the November 28 meeting of the Student Council, the
Council endorsed President Perrin Anderson's plan to present
to the Administration a request to liberalize the present auto-

mobile parking rules.

Anderson was instructed to pre-
sent three points which the Coun-
cil thought were reasonable and
necessary: first, that cars be al-
lowed to park in reserved areas on
weekends; secondly, that an “after
hours” parking time be permitted
in reserved areas; and thirdly, that
students be allowed to park their
cars in these reserved areas at
night.

The Council then heard the re-
port on the meeting between the
Faculty Social Committee and the
senior members of the Council con-
cerning the matter of unlimited
off-campus fraternity parties. The
faculty gave four reasons for the
present rule of allowing only a
limited number of off-campus func-
tions. These four reasons were: (1)
that many times, freshmen are un-
duly pressured into parties when
they need the time for work; (2)
that there is too much of an eco-
nomic burden on many students;
(3) that unlimited functions could
lead to “party” rivalries among the
various fraternities, each trying to
out-do others; and (4) finally, that
it oftentimes works an_incon-
venience on the faculty members

who are called on to chaperone the
party. A definite answer will be
given at a later date.

Vernon Hunter, in his report on

committee had come up with four
points which it thought would help
to clarify and to solve the problem.
To make the student body aware
of the problems, Hobby Cobb, the
Judge of the Court, will write an
article in the Davidsonian. Next,
there will be a forum in the Da
vidsonian presenting both the pros
and cons on the value of the Court.
Thirdly, a student poll will be
taken on the subject, and finally,
at a meeting of the class officers
they will voice their opinions. The
members of the .Council’s commit-
tee include Vernon Hunter, chair-
man; Hobby Cobb, and Carl Cooper.

Stuart Vaughn, chairman of the
Council's committee on student
body elections, will present an
answer to a recent criticism of the
method of student body elections.
The answer will appear in the Da-
vidsonian.

President Anderson sald that he
and various other interested per-
sons were still working on the
possibility of extending local tele-
phone service to Davidson from
Charlotte. He will, moreover, keep
the students posted on any pro-

tion of Davidson’s ability to grant salary increases.

In 1953 the average income for
non-farm families was $6,393 or
just slightly higher than the top
faculty salary of $6,350 at Davidson
in comparison. About 54 per cent
of these families received more
than $5,000, which was about the
average salary for the faculty as
a whole.

On the basis of an 80 per cent
response to a questionaire filled in
by the faculty it is seen that the
vast majority of the Davidson
faculty receives supplementary in-
come, many members engaging in
outside employment—often to the
detriment of their services to the
college—who would not do so if
their income were 50-100 per cent
higher. Of the faculty families with
supplemental income 45 per cent
of the wives found it necessary to
work to make ends meet, though
many of them have small children.

Seventy-eight per cent of the
faculty find it imperative to seek
summer work. Over half have re-
cently found it necessary to bor-
row money to meet current ex-
penses. Fifty per cent of the
faculty drive an automobile which
was purchased used. From the large
number of faculty bicycles seen on

campus it would seem to indicate
that most faculty families neve

given up the idea of becoming a
two-car family and have settled for
one car and a bicycle instead. The
“average” faculty member spends
annually a total of $7,309, which
is from $1,500 to $2,000 more than
the college is paying him

An important factor in the in-
creased productivity of the econ-
omy has been the rising level
of literacy and education. Though
teachers have certainly contributed
to this greater productivity, “They
are seeing the fruits of their ef-
forts going to others,” as has been
pointed out in a similar Duke Uni-
versity report. The Davidson facul-
ty member has become accustomed
to the fact that the Davidson grad-

uate will make more during his}
first year on the job than his|
former professor will even after
many years of experience.

This year at Davidson each stu-|
dent’s college fees were raised
$100, presumably to increase
faculty salaries: Thus for 1955- 56, |
Davidson's income from college
fees increased by $80,000.

throughout the country because of
the limited amount of space avail-

so serious, that many institutions,

Miami of Ohio and Carolina, do
not allow any student cars on the
campus.

Others which do allow cars re-

Bennett Cerf, TV Star, to
Speak at Davidson Dec. 7

BY CHUCK WRIGHT

As a television personality Ben-
nett Cerf is shy, different, and

keen. The appareance belies his |!

tremendous energy and_ activity.

The star of the CBS network]'

program, “What's My Line?” is a
writer, columnist, publisher, and
editor. One columnist has said of

him that he’s “run by a storage |)

battery that constantly recharges
itself.”

One of America’s most versitile
personalities, this former newspa-
per reporter is expected to draw a
near capacity audience when he
speaks here on Wednesday evening,
December 7, as the third presenta-
tion in this year’s Artist Series.
From all advance indications, the
warm and likable Mr. Serf will
prove the most popular attraction
of the year.

Mr. Cerf has chosen for his sub-
ject, “Changing Styles In American
Humor.” He is an authority on the
subject, as his literary career cov-
ers quite a span of years.

date he has thrown them in with
amazing rapidity. He received his

key, and his Litt. B in 1920 from

from whom he and _ his life-long}
friend, Donald Klopfer, brought the |

In 1927 Random House was es

dom House, to the present day, Mr
Cerf has guided the fortunes of his |

company to a place of national |

prominence in the publishing field

Among the authors represented in
its list, in addition to O'Neill, are
Sinclair Lewis, William Faulkner,
Budd Schulberg, Elliott Paul, Ward

Greene, and many others.

In his odd moments, Bennett Cerf
writes a weekly column, “Trade

of Literature, and others for This

Syndicate

He also writes books; Try and
