The evils of choosing the crown over the cross

f it wasn’t already, the verdict is

now official: The world’s priori-
ties are seriously skewed. Last
week, the
world lost
one of the
most
amazing
people it
has ever
been lucky enough to know.

She dedicated her life to help-
ing those in our society who could
not help themselves. She gave
openly while asking nothing in re-
turn. She gave the most precious
gift of all—love. And tothe people
who needed it most:

But the death of Mother Teresa
was not the lead story in the news —
it ran second to the death of another
amazing individual,
Princess Diana.

Diana was every-
thing that Mother
Teresa was not. She
was beautiful, a world-
wide symbol of ‘el-
egance and grace, rather than old,
small, hunched-backed, and frail.
Di lived among riches and royalty,
instead of rags and poverty. She
had money and glamour, whereas
Mother Teresa owned.a wooden
bowl, two wooden spoons, two pairs
of eyeglasses, and nothing else:

When the media had to decide
which story to place first, they chose
a pretty face over a ragged one,
money over poverty, and the crown
over the cross.

But the media can’t be blamed
entirely for their decision. News-
papers are a business, and being a
business, they print articles that will
sell. Sadly then, the blame lies
closer to home. Our society — as
well as most cultures around the
world — places an extremely high
emphasis on monetary wealth, ide-
alized looks, and power. .

As children, we are raised on
fairy tales like Cinderella, stories
that indirectly — and, in many cases,

directly — emphasize the beauty,
happiness, and elegance of a prin-
cess. As teenagers, we watch mov-
ies that once again glorify wealth,
idealized physical appearances, and
power. The characteristics that our
society stresses and deems impor-
tant, unfortunately, lie closer to Prin-
cess Diana than Mother Teresa.
This is not to imply that Prin-
cess Diana is a horrible person. Far
from that — Diana lived an amaz-
ing life, one worthy of much respect
and admiration. Her activism
against land mines and her concern
for the poor and those with AIDS
has been well documented. But it
would be a folly for anyone to claim

that Diana’s life was as wholly ad-
mirable as Mother Teresa’s.

While the media’s portrayal of
these unfortunate deaths was both-
ersome, perhaps: some good will
indeed come out of it. Perhaps the
coverage will strike others as off-
base at the very least and even tragic.

Perhaps it will cause people to
re-evaluate their own priorities in
life and take’a serious look at their
own actions and activities.

And maybe — hopefully —
some will recognize that they could
be a little more concerned for the
underprivileged and that they
should value sacrifice more than
glitz and wealth.

Was the security I feel this year just
a figment of my admittedly wild
imagination? Should I sprint after
these girls and spell out S-O-P-H-
O-M-O-R-E for them in body lan-

simply wrestling the taller one to

the ground and beating the igno-
rance out of her with my bare fists,
the two friends had disappeared into

I continued to my room and
thought more about the ignorant
companions. I remembered myself
at this point last year — your aver-
age frightened and thoroughly in-
timidated freshwoman. AllI wanted
was for my dad to come and take me
back home. I longed to replace the
horrible feeling that I could never
measure up to Davidson’s standards
with security and confidence. Es-
sentially, I felt nauseous for the first
three weeks of my Davidson career.

The main difference I have felt
this year is that I now have that
security and confidence. I’m a
sophomore, and I’m having a great
time. I’m old enough to be situated
with a group of friends that I adore,
and still young enough not to be
paranoid about getting a job after I
graduate. I love being around my
friends, and I am cherishing every
day that I get to be a sophomore
before my class heads out for se-

The major importance of a minor

New SGA Committee to investigate an increase in the
number of currently-offered minors

he Student Government As

sociation passed a resolu

tion last week establishing

an adjunct committee to the Coun-
cil on Academic Affairs.

This
commit-
teeisnow
in the
process
of inves-
tigating a
potential increase in the number of
departments that offer minors. Last
year, minors were passed in eight
departments: anthropology, chem-
istry, economics, French, music,
philosophy, Spanish, and theater/
speech.

Here’s how the academic spe-
cializations at Davidson break
down: a major in a subject requires
ten courses in that subject, with
requirements laid out by the respec-
tive department. One can also cre-
ate an interdisciplinary study (ma-
jor) through the Center for Interdis-
ciplinary Studies.

A concentration is a comple-
ment to the major. There are eight
established concentrations: applied
mathematics, Asian studies, ethnic
studies, gender studies, international

studies,
medical
-humani-
_ ties, neu-
oe a
science,
aon d
Southern studies. According to the
academic program of Davidson, a
minor is defined as “‘a set of five or
six courses designated by a partici-
pating department, including at least
one course at the 300-level or
higher.”

The main argument against
minors is that they detract from the
academic purpose of Davidson Col-
lege. Davidson is a liberal-arts col-
lege, and we as students are sup-

posed to experience a broad-based :

education. People opposed to mi-
nors fear that Davidson students
will concentrate too much on one or

two subjects of study and graduate
without exposure to many academic
fields, thus defeating the primary
aim of a liberal education.

I think that we ought to have
the right to choose. And we actu-
ally do, just not in all fields of study.
It is incongruent that some depart-
ments offer minors while others do
not.

A minor is tangible recogni-

. tion that a person has developed a

pretty good sense of a particular
subject at the undergraduate level.

I do not feel that the possibility
of minors in the other twelve de-
partments will take away from the
liberal-arts experience. Students
will still take classes that just plain
sound interesting, and they should
also have the opportunity to de-
velop a minor in any field that of-
fers majors. |

I hope that this committee can
work out the offering of minors
from the other departments at this
school, because it’s a choice we
ought to have.

mesters abroad. Sure I’m not in the
category of “fresh meat” anymore,
but I know that somehow I will
overcome this loss.

So close your ears to any such
tainted information. So
freshwomen, enjoy your first year ,
give those older guys whatever they
want if that’s what you think will
make you happy. But whatever you
do: be safe, be happy, be careful,

and see what wonderful things open
up to you. Don’t see older women
as enemies or foreboding presences,
because if you do, I will laugh and
point my finger at you in public.

Remember that every year you
spend at Davidson will be special in
its own way. .To my fellow sopho-
mores, let us be the strong role
models that the class of 1999 was
for us.

Butit is important to talk about

need to know our experiences with
Davidson’s seemingly pervasive
determinant of social life. One can
express positive and negative opin-

certain houses without “bashing”
them.
