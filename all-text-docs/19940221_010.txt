RTS & LIVING

MONDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 1994

By Jonathan Brooks

Carol Duncan, an art history professor
from Ramapo College of New Jersey, was
the second of three art lecturers taking part
in the art lecture series.

’ Professor Larry Ligo regards the series
as “a celebration of the beginnings of a new
building.” According to Ligo, each of the
three lecturers, Elsen, Duncan, and Tucker
were selected on the basis of two criteria:
outstanding scholarship in a particular field
and exceptional speaking ability on the un-
dergraduate level.

Carol Duncan surprised Davidson art
professors and students Monday evening by
focusing not on feminist issues in art (her
specialty), but on the elitism present in mu-
seums that caters to “well bred Anglo-Saxon
stock.” Ligo feels that Duncan did not

present a lecture “inferior to another she
might have given,” but a lecture that was
different than the expectations of students
and professors attending.

Duncan’s lecture enabled students to
ask new questions about art museums by

offering an enlightening lecture on their
nature. Her insights focused on the pur-
ported function of the museum and its actual
role.

For Duncan, a museum may be ob-
served “not simply as collections. . .but as a
totality. . .an order of collections, not just
containers for other monuments.” The mu-
seum functions as backdrop for us, as we
tend to our responsibility as a “performer
within its ritual space.” Duncan further
asserted that “an ideal observer will respond
to its cues and play its scenario.” In her
opinion, such an ideal observer may exist,
but the ideal museum is nowhere to be
found.

Moreover, she maintained that the prob-
lem with museums is that they fail tooperate
asa ritual space. Duncan’s interest, thus, lay
in exploring “what they say they do and
what they do without saying.”

In the United States, the museum age
began inthe late-19th century with the found-
ing of the Boston and New York Art Muse-

democratic ideals, the art museum was sup-
posed to be a place of learning and “uplifting
pleasure.” The ideal museum’s aim was to
offer the common citizen “palaces with trea-
sures.” Instead, according to Professor
Duncan, they have evolved into a parading
place for rich sponsors.

Ofcourse, as Duncan noted, the Ameri-
can museum is nothing more than a Euro-
pean import; so, although it professes egali-
tarian ideals, it has not altered that much
from its European cousin. Carol Duncan
explained that the Louvre in France func-
tioned as a “potential political power” and
made “visible Republican ideals of the state.”

In America, the museums do not so
much express the ideals of the government
as they glorify the millionaires that made the
museum possible. The museums in the
early 20th century claimed to be “of the
people, by the people, and for the people” as
they professed in handouts and advertise-
ments for the museums. Inside, however,

Students vent feelings on dating

By Katy Moore
With topics ranging from in-
terracial dating to Davidson’s prac-
tice of eating in separate houses,

Dating at

Davidson

The second in a series

the dating forum held on Wednes-
day night in the 900 Room was a

success. A panel of six students sat

behinda curtain and, with disguised
voices, discussed and answered
questions about dating at Davidson.

Don and Meg Kimmel facili-
tated the discussion and opened
the forum with descriptions of their

own college dating experiences in
the 1950s and 60s. Dr. Kimmel
described a dating scene alien to
the current college generation: the
male initiated the date, picked up
the female, and served as the
woman’s “caretaker” for the
evening. He also claimed that col-
lege students often were not sexu-
ally active in the 1950s.

His wife, Mrs. Kimmel, said

that although students in the '60s

would often get drunk at parties
and maybe even have sex, people
attended those parties as couples.
The Kimmels could not understand
why most Davidson students do
not date and instead find the people
they want to see at parties on Patter-
son Court. The couple then turned
to the panel for answers.

The first question, posed to
men onthe panel, asked: “What do
Davidson women want in a rela-
tionship? The responses varied.
One male said, “someone to
marry.” . Another disagreed:
“Women want someone they can
have a good time with ... a sensi-
tive guy.”

The Kimmels then directed
the same question to the female
panelists: “What do men want ina
relationship?” The three females
agreed that men wanted “a good
time — sex.”

Next, the panelists were asked
to pinpoint Davidson’s dating prob-
lem. One male said that the prob-
lem lies in “the nerd factor.” He

Davidson?

Rivalry among the Union
and the seven Patterson Court
fraternities characterizes parties
during Davidson’s three major
social weekends: Homecoming,
Midwinters, and Spring Frolics.

An all-campus dance,
sponsored by all student organi-
zations instead of individual
fraternities, would enhance the
social milieu at Davidson.
Independents and Greeks could
socialize and women could
participate in social weekends
without having to wait for an
invitation.

Other schools welcome all-
campus dances as an addition to
the usual fraternity parties and as
a means of integrating the entire
student body.

Washington and Lee, a small
Southern university similar in
many ways to Davidson, hosts an
annual ball called “Fancy Dress.”

This collegiate prom has
been a tradition for over 50 years
and features a four-day entertain-
ment extravaganza beginning
Wednesday night with fraternity
parties, continuing Thursday
with a band performance and
concluding Saturday with more
parties. What distinguishes
"Fancy Dress" from other party
weekends, though, is the formal
ball held Friday evening, which

- is open to all students who

purchase tickets for around $70-

$80.

The event is partially funded
by alums who remember the
event fondly. Often, nostalgic
alums even return for the
weekend.

Washington and Lee’s
“Fancy Dress” is organized by a
Student Activities Board chaired
by three students. Under each
chair is ‘a sub-committee respon-
sible for decorating a portion of
the gym where the dance is held.
In addition, 60 students are hired
as contract workers to help paint
and build the decorations.

The “Fancy Dress” commit-
tee also decides on a theme,
mails invitations to all students,
and sells T-shirts and other
memorabilia.

Sub-committee chair Goose
Garrigius, a junior at W&L,
says, “Fancy Dress has been
ranked one of the top social
events in Southern colleges and
universities.”

Since 80% of the men at
W&L are Greek, the smashing
success of W&L’s “Fancy
Dress” weekend dispels the myth
that an all-campus dance on a
Greek campus is doomed to
failure.

Dartmouth, another school
with an active Greek system, also
pulls off successful all-campus
functions including a formal dance, -

Responding to images--fear, misunderstanding, & confusion

By Josh Larned
On Thursday, February 17,
Davidson Professor Shaw Smith
led an enlightening discussion on
art censorship with a small group
of students. The talk, sponsored
by the Solidarity Committee and
the Davidson College Union,
proved a fitting culmination to the

events of Solidarity Week.
Smith began his lecture by
posing a question surrounding the
problem of censorship: “Why do

we respond to certain images the
way we do?” He challenged his
audience to reevaluate their atti-
tudes and conceptions towards the
visual arts.

Partially relying upon David
Friedburg’s The Power of Images,
Smith examined four problem ar-
eas which collectively create the

framework of art censorship. First,

he commented on the phenomenon
of Protestantism as an element of
art suppression. As Protestantism

tends to be iconoclastic, an ulti-
mate separation exists between
word and image. This rift creates
a “fear of imagery” which pen-
etrates the fabric of society, par-
ticularly in the American South.
Smith cited the lack of free-stand-
ing sculpture and the unadorned
interior of DCPC as examples of
how Protestantism limits expres-
sion on Davidson’s campus.
Second, Smith acknowledged
the problem of recognition and

subsequent rejection when ap-
proaching a work of art. This ten-
dency toward repulsion often
causes the viewer to misunderstand
a work and, thus, he feels inclined
to suppress it.

The third problem, according
to Smith, is a confusion between
image and prototype. When a par-
ticular version of a work is taken
for its prototype, an interpretation
can result that is contrary to the
artist’s intentions. Such “mental

operations” require deconstruction
in order to reverse any feelings
towards censorship on the part of
the viewer. “Slow your percep-
tions down,” Smith pleaded with
the audience in-an effort to get
them to see certain works of art in
a different light.

The final problem outlined by
Smith was that of the “Father and
Son.” Western Christendom, with
