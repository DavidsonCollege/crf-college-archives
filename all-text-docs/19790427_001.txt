‘The rain almost fell to make the St. George's Day celebrations out-
side Chambers oa Monday a truly British occasion. Fortunately it
held off, allowing celebrants to munch cucumber sandwiches and
scones filled with cream and jam and to sip hot tea. Traditional
garden party band music set the tone for the affair, while some
l)avidsonians went for a ride on the new Dragon of St. George—a
red double-decker London bus. Students abandoned the frisbee for
the croquet maHet and ball. Finally the Queen arrived in a white
Rolls Royce, waved regally from the balcony of Chambers, and

mingled with the commoners.

Subcommittee to recommend
future uses of Richards and Bailey

By JOHN SIMAN
Staff Writer

It is possible that in the fall of
1980 a combination of national
fraternities, a women’s eating
house, or coed eating houses
will occupy Richards and Bailey
Houses.

A subcommittee of the Coun-
cil on Campus and Religious
Life will make a formal recom-
mendation at the end of the
term on how Bailey and Rich-
ards should be used when the
planned Campus Commons
goes into operation, according
to subcommittee chairman
Byram Ratliff.

If the Commons is completed
on schedule, it will accomodate
freshmen starting in the fall of
1980, thus allowing Bailey and
Richards to be used as -upper-
class eating houses.

Richards will be between
Rusk House and Pax, and Bail-

Tease

Friday’s Convocation speaker

Time Executive Editor, alumnus JasonMcManus will speak

By PETE HUX
Staff Writer
Jason McManus '56 will be
on campus today to deliver the

‘ Spring Convocation address to

the college community and to
receive an honorary doctor of
letters degree. >

McManus is currently the
executive editor of Time maga-
zine, a position he assumed in
November 1978. He is respon-
sible for the articles comprising
the ‘back of the book’’—the
culture and arts and sciences
sections of Time.

Prior to his promotion,
McManus held a broad range of
posts during his 20 year tenure
with Time, including writer,
foreign correspondent, foreign
news editor, national affairs
editor, and managing editor.
While serving abroad,
McManus was responsible for
the magazine’s European circu-
lation.

Since graduation from David-
son, McManus has returned to
campus a number of times,
most recently in 1974 when he
delivered a lecture on Water-
gate. He described his student
years at Davidson as ‘‘pleasant,
almost bucolic.”

He noted, ‘Davidson was an
isolated environment which was
different from University City
(Mo.) where I grew up.”’

As an English major,
McManus acheived a number of
distinctions during his David-
son years. He became a member
of Phi Beta Kappa, made Who’s
Who Among Students in Amer-
ican Universities and Colleges,
was president of the Phi Delta

Theta fraternity his senior year,
was awarded an Agnes Sentelle
Brown Scholarship, and ulti-

mately became the College’s *

twelfth Rhodes Scholar (there
have now been 19).

McManus observed,. ‘‘David-
son undergone many changes,

most of them for the better.
There.were no women or black
students while I was here.”

McManus hinted that the
topic of his Convocation ad-.
dress would be concerned with
controls in modern American
society.

Two Davidson women molested
near library on Wednesday night

By MARK BARRETT
Assistant News Editor

Two Davidson women were
molested on campus in two
separate incidents Wednesday
night. Both were accosted on
their way from the lbrary to
Cannon dorm by three black
juvenile males at approximately
8:30 and 8:45p.m. .

One of the girls said in both
cases, ‘‘The three of them
surrounded each of us and put
an arm across. our chests,
waists, and buttocks and put a
hand on our bodies in an
extremely obscene, sexual
way.”

Neither of the girls were
detained for any length of time.
One said she ‘‘walked rapidly
away” and the other ‘‘screamed
and ran into Cannon.”’

‘I was shocked and terri-
fied,’’ one said.

The three juveniles were ap-
prehended and escorted off
campus soon afterwards, ac-
cording to Campus Police Chief
J.G. Hughes. Officer Freddy
Cornelius told them they would
be charged with trespassing if
they returned.

Hughes said the young
blacks were not arrested be-
cause Cornelius had understood
the boys had merely ‘‘shoved a
girl off the sidewalk.”

The first girl to be accosted
called security soon after the
incident. She said, ‘‘I told
security, “Three guys are walk-

‘ing around. campus harassing

students.’ The security guard
said OK and hung up.”

She admitted her call, “was
not explicit enough.’’ Town
policeman Johnny Gantt, who
was on duty at the time,: said he
understood over the police radio
that, ‘‘It was an accident, just
some horseplay. The boys were
escorted off campus anyway,
since they had no business
being there in the first place.”

One of the girls replied, ‘‘It
was definitely not an accident,
it was obviously planned.
Horseplay is between friends
and is not sexual. We were
terrified.’’

The second girl to be accosted
said she called the security
number later in the night after
she had talked with the other

National fraternities at Davidson follow U.S. trend, feel resurgence

By BILL PEEPLES
Executive Editor
Recent investigation indicates that the
nationwide revival by national fraternities
has been accompanied by a positive,
parallel resurgence within the Davidson
College Greek system.
Davidson's _big-
est success story is Pi
Kappa Alpha. Accor-
ding to president Trip
Ruth, his house has
grown from eight-
een brothers and thirty-two sideeg two
years ago to sixty-two brothers and
twenty-six pledges this year.
PiKA no longer has women and non-nat-
ional members.

Focus

Hag increased quantity of brothers meant
a reduction in quality? Ruth thinks not in
PiKA’s situation. ‘‘Last year the average
GPA at our house was the highest of all
PiKA chapters it’the nation,” he noted. .

However, Ruth contends that his bro-
thers are not library rats who do nothing
but study.” They work hard and they play
hard. ‘It (studying) doesn’t keep us from
having a good time," Ruth said.

Ruth fears movies like ‘Animal House”
and articles in national magazines - about

‘toga parties are misleading and _ provide

only a small and negative view of fraternity
life. ‘‘Parents see movies like ‘Animal
House’, but they aren’t here to see what’s
really going on and unfortunately get the
wrong idea,”’ Ruth said.

A campus-wide involvement that runs
contrary to the whole ‘‘Animal House”’
image is exemplified by Phi Gamma Delta,
one of two. Davidson fraternities with an
off-campus house.

‘We had a super pledge class of twenty-
nine this year, which is due to the
popularity of off-campus fraternities,’’ re-
ported FIJI president Jim Lytle.

FIJI has forty-five brothers this year, up
from last.year, in which they had less than

twenty pledges, according to Lytle.

“Our membership has been increasing
ever since we moved off campus” nearly ten
years ago, Lytle said. ©

“There is also a growth in spirit with the
national fraternity."’

In the last few years, the FIJI’s have
been a diverse group which includes hall
counselors, Phi Beta Kappa finalists,
Student Government Association senators,
N.C. Fellows, members of the Committee
on Campus‘and Religious Life, a Student
Solicitor for the Honor Council, and compe-
titors in inter-collegiate athletics. -

_ Phi Delta Theta president Dave Donald-

son said he is bothered by sentiment that
the Phi Delts are a bunch of animals.

Though the members of PDT have been
predominantly football players for the last
few years, he said this situation is
changing.

“This year’s pledge class is about half
football players and the rest either partici-
pants in minor athletics or people who are
not athletically oriented,’’ Donaldson said.

When asked about misconduct that is
definitely alcohol related, a problem faced
by both fraternities and-local eating houses,
Donaldson said that, ‘“You just can’t put
fifty guys together drinking and not have
something not go wrong.’’

Donaldson believes that any new interest
in fraternities on campus is not a result of a
national trend because Davidson students
lack school spirit. “It really ticks me off
that when I’m going to the stadium for a
Saturday afternoon football game, I see
people walking to the library when there is a
football game a hundred yards away.

‘Fraternities should hardly consider
themselves elitist,"’ Donaldson said, ‘but
we shouldn't be subject to the same
restrictions as a house that is only an eating
house."’

Phi Delta Theta recently boasts a
Patterson Court. Council chairman. Union
