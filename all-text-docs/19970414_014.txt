Kruse’s Cubby

Touch ’em
all, big fella

By Micuaet Kruse

We’ ve seen it coming for years.

National League pitchers
couldn’t stop San Francisco third
baseman Matt Williams in 1994, but
the strike could — and did.

After the holdout at the begin-
ning of 1995, Albert Belle -— then a
fearsome, media-loathing Cleveland
Indian and now a fearsome, media-
loathing Chicago White Sock — hit
an even 50 in the second straight
abridged season.

And 1996 was the Year of the

scoffed at past home run records, and
then broke them.

Florida’s Gary Sheffield hit the
4,459th dinger of the season, break-
ing the big-league record set in 1987.
He did it in early September.

But one record remained un-
touched.

Roger Maris’ 61-homer season
in 1961 — the most hallowed mark
in baseball’s rich annals — still stands
as the slugging standard.

I won’t say you heard it here
first because I know I’m not the first

This is the year.

Maris’ record has been doing a
worrisome balancing act on a paper-
thin tight rope for a while now. The

Roger from his 36-year reign as
baseball’s greatest single-season
power hitter.

Retro-style ballparks with
shorter fences and less foul territory
— the architectural preference these
days — make it seem like hitters are
taking aim at golf balls with metal
bats.

In 1909, Red Murray of the
New York Giants led the NL with
seven round trippers. A guy named
Home Run Baker went yard nine
times in 1914 to pace the American
League. Nowadays, a seven-homer
week is outstanding, a seven-homer
month above average. But a seven-
homer season? I don’t care what
position you play — you’ re playing
itin the minors.

The pitching has been diluted
by expansion, contributing to an en-
vironment in which Little-League-
caliber pitchers wither under the
wrath of major-league-caliber hit-
ters.

‘Hoss Radbourne, a pitcher for
Providence’s NL franchise in 1884,
went 60-12 witha 1.38 ERA and 441
strikeouts. A century and 13 years
later, a manager is not only ecstatic
to have a guy on his staff with an
ERA under 3.50, but that guy is a
bonafide Cy Young contender.

But the batsmen deserve some
credit, too. They are just bigger,
stronger, and better. And there are so
many of them. There are so many
worthy candidates.

Especially considering 16 play-
ers hit 40 or more homers last season.
The previous high? Eight, in 1961.

At least half of those 16 have a
real opportunity to hit a 62nd homer
this season. Mark McGwire, who hit
52 homers last year in just 423 at-
bats (Maris hit his 61 in 590), could
do it with some breathing room if he
manages to stay healthy.

Frank Thomas and Belle, now
teammates instead of intra-divisional
rivals, comprise one of the scariest
power-hitting duos ever.

Women’s lax overcomes sluggish start
for a convincing Senior Day victory

Talent, conditioning too mu

By WILL BRADSHAW

For the first half of senior day,
it was close. But the women’s la-
crosse team (5-3) opened Saturday’s
second frame with a vengeance,
scoring six straight goals to drop
Limestone, 15-6."

“We played really sloppy in
the first half, but I think we picked
it up in the
second,”
Katie
Nelson
said. “I think that we get out and
we’re not as focused as we should
be, but in the second half we real-
ized what went wrong, and that we
had to pick it up.”

Limestone tied the game at five
with arun late in the first period, but
in the last five minutes Davidson
showed signs of their second-half
dominance tocome. Picking up their
play, the Wildcats closed out the
period with two goals.

“The first half was a little ugly,

_but we cleaned it up,” said coach

Mary Schwartz. “I think the last
five minutes of the half we started
to gain a little composure, and we
came out in the second half and did
what we had to do.

“When you play against teams
that are not as good as you, you tend
to play down to their level. Lime-
stone was really playing on emo-
tion, and they were really fired up
for the game. You could see that.”

But Limestone’s intensity
couldn’t stand up to the Wildcats’
second half onslaught. Improved
play after the break is becoming a

trend for Davidson, which has used ~

early second-period runs to blow
out their last two opponents (the

weekend),

“We came out a little flat, but
we came around and started to play
a little stronger in the second half,”
assistant coach Bryn Chave said.
“At halftime we told them they had
to focus a lot more on the game and
what they wanted. The attack had to
be a lot stronger. We needed to cut
more and shoot around the goalie
more, and then they just did a lot
nicer things. —

“Also, we’re in really, really
good shape. We’ve worked really
hard all pre-season and the fall to
develop our endurance. What blows
a lot of people away is the fact that

we can run the whole game if we
want to.” . :

Amanda Fleck, Katie Williams,
and Linda Rothemund notched three
goals each. With six games remain-
ing, both Fleck (28 goals) and Wil-
liams (22) are quickly closing on
teammate Sarah Hogan’s single-
season record for goals (34, set last
year). After one goal on Saturday,
Hogan (20) is also threatening to
top her own mark.

This squad’s six seniors
(Hogan, Lisa Dorson, Rebecca
MacLean, Allison Rhoads, Tanner
Thompson, and Marion
Woodworth) were honored ina pre-

match ceremony.

“It’s exciting to win (the final
home match), but it’s kind of sad,”
Hogan said. “Still, it hasn’t hit me
yet since we have six games left.”

Schwartz is trying to schedule
future seasons so that home and
away matches will be better mixed
throughout the season.

“We’re still adjusting. Ohio St.
and Duke ended up coming to us at
the same time, and they’re at the
end of the season,” she said. “So
I’m switching to where Duke is
going to be earlier in April next
year. We’ re just adjusting and work-
ing out the kinks.”
