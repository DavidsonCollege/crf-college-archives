Book Burners Would
Erase Old Folk Lore

The social crisis of this generation
— the mixing of the races — has
reached the point where the integre-
tionists have now begun “to burn the
books.”

We are speaking, of course. about
the censoring of American folk songs
for the purpose of erasing any refer-
ences to certain minority groups.

For example. popular recordings
of “My. Old Kentucky Home.”
“Sewanee River.” and “Old Black
Joe” have been changed to delete
such words as “darkies.” “massa.”
and ‘mammy ™ Others. like “Old. Man
River.’ no longer say ‘white’ folks.”

The idea here. explain radio and
TV officials, is to avoid’ all words or
expressions that might be offensive
to any religious or racial group.

How. .we wonder. have “Amos ‘n
Andy” survived this long!

The censoring. moreover. is not
limited to songs. Only a few weeks
ago. the New York City Board of Edu-
cation removed from the reading lists
of the, elementary and junior high
schools “The Adventures of Huckle-
berry Finn.” Its reason for banning
Mark Twain's classic was that the
book made references that were un-
favorable to Negroes.

Mark Twain. we feel sure, never

intended to insult anybody when he
wrote about Huck Finn. Furthermore,
Stephen Foster meant to honor the
colored people with his “Sewanee
River."

One Congressman has charged the
NAACP as the guiding force behind
this present drive to censor the na-
tion's songs and books.

It is indeed a sorry state in which
we find ourselves when men grow
hvsterical to the point that they must
“burn the books” for fear that some
minority group may feel offended.

We all know that in the end this
ridiculous drive to change American
folk lore will fare no better than did.
Hitler's book burning of the 1930's.

The ironical part about the whole
affair. however, is the fact that the
very group (i.e naive liberals) that
has yelled the loudest about. “rights”.
is now the same group that is en-
croaching on others’ rights by trying
to erase many concrete facts of Amer-
ican literature. :

As someone put it, “if we follow the
same logic arid reasoning of the net-
works in banning ‘My Old Kentucky
Home’ from the air, then we may. have
to change the name of the White
House because this might conceivably
be classified as discrimination.”

Bye, Bye Herb

The brightest piece of news dur-
ing last week’s flu wave was the resig-
nation of. Herbert Brownell. Jr. as
Attorney-General.

If it is any satisfaction to him.
“Dear Herb” will be happy to know
that only General Sherman rivals
him as the most unpopular man in
the South.

The only difference between the
two is that Sherman led his soldiers
personally, while Brownell directed
the troops from behind a desk in the
“Department of Justice.” (Also, Sher-
man didn’t have a five-star golfing
enthusiast as advisor.)

The. good news about Herb. how-
ever, was soon neutralized bv the
White House’s announcement that
William P. Rogers would be the new

’ Attorney-General.

Mr. Rogers. you will remember.
is a “close personal friend” of Tricky
Dickie Nixon. Now we don't advocate
“guilt by association,” but what self-
respecting Southerner would want
Tricky Dickie as a character refer-
ence.

And so we see that even though
Hilarious Herb has gone back to New
York. the same old gang of ‘‘modern
Republicans” witl be left intack—at
least until 1960.

Angels of Mercy

Student flu victims of last week's
epidemic owe a great deal of thanks

and appreciation to those of the Da-.

vidson community who helped make
the stay in bed a little more comforta-
ble.

Professors’ wives, friends of the
college, secretaries, and even some
professors themselves did everything
from carrying food trays to poking
thermometers. These services were
purely voluntary.

Probably no one worked harder

than Dr. Kneedler and the Infirmary
staff.

The easy cooperation and thought-
ful gestures are typical of the pleasant
relationship that exists among the
whole Davidson College community.

Convocation

This morning's Convocation was
entirely appropriate. It served to
recognize some of those men who have
contributed to the betterment of Da-
vidson College.

Davidson is blessed with a group
of distinguished friends and alumni
who are eager and willing to support
the work of the college. This morn-
ing’s ceremony was the college’s way

of showing its appreciation and grati- |

tude.

Students who attended. the Con-
vocation could not have. failed to be
impressed by the many outstanding
and notable visitors. We only wish
that some way could be arranged for
interested students to meet and talk
to such distinguished guests when
they come to the campus.

Perhaps a reception to which stu-
dents are invited would be an answer.
An opportunity to meet some of our
business, religious. and political lead-
ers would be a broadening experi-
ence for our students.

Paris Headline

The Russian ‘‘sputnik” brought all
kinds of reactions from people every-
where as the earth satellite circled
the globe.

A Paris newspaper, for example,
carried the _ following headline:
“Grippe, grippe, grippe, crisis, crisis,
crisis, beep, beep, beep.”

For A Change

This week's issue of “Conformity”
was most ‘“unconforming” by being
throughly enjoyable for a change.

There Is No Fourteenth Amendment!

By DAVID LAWRENCE
Editor, U. S. News & World Report

A mistaken belief—that there is a valid article in
the Constitution known as the “Fourteenth Amendment”
—is responsible for the Supreme Court decision of 1954
and the ensuing controversy over desegregation in the

public schools of America.

No such amendment was ever legally ratified by
three fourths of the States of the Union as required by

the Constitution itself.

The so-called “Fourteenth
Amendment” was dubiously pro-
claimed by the Secretary of
State on July 20, 1868. The Pres-
ident shared that doubt.

There were 37 States in the
Union at the time, so ratifica-
tion by at least 28 was neces-
sary to make the amendment
an integral part of the Constitu-
tion. Actually, only 2i States
legally ratified it. So it failed
of ratification.

Undisputed Record

The undisputed records, at-
tested by officias journais and
the unanimous writings of

historians, establishes these
events as occurring in 1867 and
1868:

1. Outside the South, six
States—New Jersey, Ohio, Ken-
tucky, California, Delaware and
Maryland—failed to ratify the
proposed amendment.

2. In the South, ten States—
Texas, Arkansas, Virginia, North
Carolina. South Carolina,
Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mis-
sissippi and Louisana—by for-
mal action of their legislatures,
rejected it under the normal
processes of civil law.

3. A total of 16 legislatures
out of 37 failed legally to rati-
fy the “Fourteenth Amend-

ment.”

4. Congress—which had de-
prived the Southern States of
their seats in the Senate—did
not lawfully pass the resolution
of submission in the first in-
stance.

5. The Southern States which
had rejected the amendment
were coerced by a federal sta-
tute passed in 1867 that took
away the right to vote or hold
office from all citizens who had
served in the Confederate
Army.

Military governors were ap-
pointed and instructed to pre-
pare the roll of voters. All this
happened in spite of the pres-
idential proclamation of amnes-
ty previously issued by the
President.

New legislatures were there-
upon chosen and forced to “rati-
fy” under penalty of continued
exile from the Union. In Louisi-
ana, a General sent down from
the North presided over the
State legislature.

6. Abraham Lincoin had de-
clared many times that the

COFFEE BREAK

Death Of §&
A Utopian

By JOHN BERNHARDT

It was with real sadness that
we read last week that “the
Utopian philosopher died some
years ago”. We had liked to
assume that -we fell into the
class of Utopians, but now it
seems we are defunct.

Utopia is a dream-land where
all of life fits the ideal of what
it should be. The word means
“nowhere”, however, suggest-
ing cynically that this ideal
world ean never be realized.
That may hold true, but the
idealist is willing to batter him-
self to death to move the world
one inch closer to the. ideal.

UTOPIANS NEEDED

As long as this world is not
the best possible, we need some
Utopians in every crowd. Why
is it that the Utopian thinkers
and the idea men seem to be
dying out at Davidson? Prob-
ably one of the main causes is
the passing of the bull session;
the red-hot argument seems to
be what died some years ago.

As freshmen, we seniors were
warned not to spend too much
time in bull sessions. Unfortu-
nately, we seem to have forgot-
ten the other side of the state-
ment. which was that a certain
amount of such debate was a
pretty necessary part of a col-

is

lege education.

Certainly, this passing of the
idealist and the creative think-
er is related to the homogeniza-
tion of the Davidson student
body. Have the bull sessions
died because nobody has any-
thing new to say. or has the
death of independent thinking
killed the opportunity of creat-
ing new men?

It seems to be séme of both.
At least, though, a good round
of bull sessions ougnt to bring
out some of the remaining
talent.

PLEA FOR ORIGINALITY

This is not a demand for anti-
conformity; it is a plea for
something original, something
better than the usual pattern.
Radio Free Davidson has been
a local smash-hit because it is
an original way to break the
boredom around here. ‘“Con-
formity” was a success because
it was new.

RUM FLAVORING

We offer a free cup of cof-
fee to anybody wanting to sit
and argue about anything. no
matter what. Rum for flavoring
to the one who uncovers a
Utopian or an idea man. We
need some originality and ideals
mixed into our Davidson homo.
genate.

Ed. Note: David Lawrence
writes about the entire Four-
teenth Amendment. However,
the portion on which the May,
1954 decision was based is the
last five words of Section 3.

SECTION |
CIVIL RIGHTS

All persons born or natural-
ized in the United States, and
subject to the jurisdiction there-
of, are citizens of the United
States and of the state where-
in they reside. No state shali
make or enforce any law which
shail abridge the privileges of
immunities of citizens of the
United States; nor shall any
state deprive any person of life,
tiberty, or property, without
due process of law, nor deny
to any person within its juris-
diction the equal protection of
the laws.

A Contemporary View of
“Reconstruction”

Union was “inseparable” and
“indivisible.” After his death,
and when the war was over,
the ratification by the Southern
States of the Thirteenth Amend-
ment, abolishing slavery, had
been accepted as legal.

But Congress in the 1867 law
imposed the specific conditions
under which the Southern
States would be “entitled to
representation in Congress.”

7. Congress, in passing the
1867 law that declared the
Southern States could not have
their seats in either the Senate
or House in the next session
unless they ratified the “Four-
teenth Amendment,” took an
unprecedented step.

No such right—to compel a
State by en act of Congress to
ratify a constitutional amend-
ment—is to be found anywhere
in the Constitution. Nor has
this procedure ever been sanc-

‘tioned by the Supreme Court

of the United States.

8. President Andrew Johnson
publicly denounced this law
as unconstitutional. But it was
passed over his veto.

9. Secretary of State Seward
was on the spot in July. 1868
when the various “ratifications”
of a spurious nature were
placed before him. The legis-
latures of Ohio and New Jer-

sey had notified him that they”

rescinded their earlier action
of ratification.

He said in his official procla-
mation that he was not author-
ized as Seerctary of State “to
determine and decide doubtful
questions as to the authenticity
of the organization of State
legislatures or as to the power
of any State legislature to re-
call a prévious act or resolu-
tion of ratification.”

He added that the amend-
ment was valid “if the resolu-
tions of the legislatures of Ohio
and New Jersey, ratifying the
aforesaid amendment, are to
be deemed as remaining of full
force and effect, notwithstand-
ing the subsequent resolutions
of thé legislatures of these
States.” This was a very big
“if.

it will be noted that the real
issue, therefore, is not only
whether the forced “ratifica-
tion” by the ten Southern States
was lawful, but whether the
withdrawal by the legisiatures
of Ohio and New Jersey—two
Northern States—was legal.

The right of a State, by action
of its legislature. to change its
mind. at any time before the
final proclamation of ratifica-
tion is issued by the Secretary
of State has been confirmed in
connection with other constitu-
tional amendments.

10. The Oregan Legislature in
October 1868 — three months
after the Secretary’s proclama-
tion was issued—passed a re-
scinding resolution, which ar-
gued that the “Fourteenth
Amendment” had not been rati-
fied by three fourths of the
States and that the “ratifica-
tions" in the Southern States
were “usurpations, unconstitu-
tional. revolutionary and void"
and that, “until such ratifica-
tion is completed, any State has
a right to withdraw its assent
to any proposed amendment.”

What Others Say

What do the historians say
about al] this? The Encyclope-
dia Americana states:

“Reconstruction added humili-
ation to suffering ... . Eight
years of crime, fraud, and cor-
ruption followed and it was
State legislatures composed of
Negroes, carpetbaggers and
scalawags who obeyed the
orders of the generals and rati-
fied the amendment.”

W. E. Woodward, in his fa-
mous work, “A New American
History," published in 1936,
says:

“To get a clear idea of the
succession of events let us re-
view (President Andrew) John-
son's actions in respect to the
ex-Confederate States.

“In May, 1865, he issued a
Proclamation of Amnesty to for-
mer rebels, Then he established
provisional governments in all
the Southern States. They were
instructed to call Constitutional
Conventions. They did. New
State governments were elected.
White men only had the suf-
frage (the Fifteenth Amendment
establishing equal voting rights

By Schulz

had not yet been passed).

“Senators and Representatives
were chosen, but when they ap-
peared at the opening of Con.
gress they were refused permis-
sion. The State governments,
however, continued to function
during 1866.

“Now we are in 1867. tn the
early days of that year (Thad-
deus) Stevens brought in, as
chairman of the House Recon-
struction Committee, e bill that
proposed to sweep all the South.
ern State governments into the
wastebasket. The South was to
be put under military rule.

“The, bill passed. It was ve-
toed by Johnson and passed
again over his veto. In the
Senate it was amended in such
fashion that any State could
escape from military rule and
be restored to its full rights by
ratifying the Fourteenth Amend.
ment and admitting black as
well as white men to the polls.”

In challenging its constitu:
tionality, President Andrew
Johnson said in his veto mes.
sage:

“I submit to Congress whether. |
this measure is notin its whole
character, scope and object
without precedent and without
authority, in palpable conflict
with the plainest provisions of
the Constitution, and utterly de-
structive of those great princi:
ples of liberty and humanity
for which our ancestors on both
sides of the Atlantic have shed
so much blood and expended so
much treasure.” .
. Many historians have ap.
plauded Johnson’s words, Sam.
uel Eliot Morison and Henry
Steele Commager, known today
as “liberals,” wrote in their
book, “The Growth of the
American Republic”:

“Johnson returned the bill
with a scorching message ar-
suing the unconstitutionality of
the whole thing, and most im-
partial students have agreed
with his reasoning.”

James Truslow Adams, an-
other noted historian, writes in.
his “History of the United
States”:

“The Supreme Court had de-
cided three months earlier, in
the Milligan case, .. . that mili-
tary courts were unconstitu-
tional except under such war
conditions as might make the
operation of civil courts impos.
sible, but. the President point-
ed out in vain that practically
the whole of the new legislation
was unconstitutional.

“. .. There was even talk in
Congress of impeaching the Su-
preme Court for its decisions!
The legislature had run amok
and was threatening both the
Executive and the Judiciary.”

Actually, President Johnson
was impeached, but the move
failed by one vote in the Senate.

The Supreme Court, in case
after case, refused to pass on
illegal activities involved in
“ratification.” It said simply
that they were acts of the “po-
litieal departments of the Gov:
ernment.” This, of course, was
a convenient device of avoid-
ance. The Court has adhered
to that position ever since Re-
construction Days.

Andrew C. McLaughlin, whose
“Constitutional History of the
United States” is a standard
work, writes:

“Can a State which is not a
State and not recognized as
such by Congress, perform the
supreme duty of ratifying an
amendment to the fundaments!
law? Or does a State—by con-
gressional thinking—cease to be
a State for some purposes but
not for others?” :

This is the tragic history of
the so-called “Fourteenth
Amendment”—a record that is
a disgrace to free government
and a “government of law.”

Isn't the use of military force
to override local government
what we deplored in Hungary?

Never Too Late

; It is never too late to correct
injustice. The people of Ameri-
ca should have an opportunity
to pass on an amendment to
the Constitution that sets
fourth the right of the Federal
Government to control educa
tion and regulate attendance. at
public schools either with fed-
eral power alone or concur:
rently with the States. .
_ That's the honest way, the
Just way to deal with the prob-
lem of segregation or integra-
tion in the schools. Until such
an amendment is adopted. the
“Fourteenth Amendment"
should be considered as null and
void.

There is only one supreme
tribunal—it is the people them.
selves. Their sovereign will is
expressed through the _ pro-
cedures set forth in the Con- |
stitution itself.
