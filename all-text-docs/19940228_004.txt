from Mount Mourne to Cornelius,

The housing might have dis-

something else irked the adminis-
tration. Students had taken advan-
tage of escaping on-campus super-
vision by holding house parties
and inviting young ladies from
around the area to join them.
Townspeople thought this quite a
travesty. Remember, the stodgy,
Presbyterian Davidson of the late
twenties did not allow dancing,
drinking, or any othersinning. Not
only would the sinner be damned
to hell, but the faculty would make
sure he no longer matriculated at
Davidson in the meantime. The
faculty thought even the mild par-
ties off campus provided danger-
ous moral and social diversions for

the student body.

Not forlong, though! College
administrators (rather than the fac-
ulty) enacted a plan to purchase the
off-campus houses and build new
chapter lodges together on cam-
pus.. The idea was to get all stu-
dents together in the dorms and to
give every chapter equal floor space
under a semblance of college su-
pervision. In 1928 fraternities sold
their houses onto the college and
moved on Fraternity Court, known
now as Jackson Court. While not
anything special today, nothing like
this innovative plan had been tried
before. Eventually many schools,
including Presbyterian College,

Alum heads

Former Davidson basketball
player Perry “Rocky” Crosswhite
helped snare the 2000 Summer
Olympics for Sydney last Septem-
ber as Secretary General of the
Australian Olympic Committee.
Crosswhite, who is also a member
of the Olympic Planning Commit-
tee which will have a principal role
in organizing the 2000 Games, shed
light on the Olympic movement
and international sports on Febru-

ary 23 in the 900 Room.
Crosswhite views
giganticism as the “greatest chal-
lenge facing the Olympics.” The
extensive process of obtaining an
Olympic Games for a city can be
exhausting both politically and fi-
nancially. In September, Sydney
won the games by a one-vote mar-
gin over Bejing in voting by Inter-
national Olympic Committee

(IOC) members.
Another difficult task for the
Olympics, according to

Crosswhite, is maintaining the uni-
versality of the games. He worries
that the western world dominates
the Games in terms of events en-
tered and number of successful
athletes. “How do you make sure
it belongs to the rest of the world,
and did it ever?” he said.
Crosswhite also discussed the
commercialization of the Games
as a potential problem. He cited
the compromise made at Barcelona

in 1992 when TV officials insisted
that Olympic officials change the
time of the marathon which had
been scheduled for 8 a.m.

He also expressed disappoint-
ment with the inclusion of NBA
players in America’s “Dream
Team” in Barcelona. "As much as
I don’t like it, I think it [the inclu-
sion of professionals] is right. I got
bored, quite frankly, but I’m in the
minority.”

Crosswhite then explored
drugs as a problem plaguing Olym-
pic competition. China and many
Soviet-bloc nations still have not
implemented drug testing with their
athletes. The IOC faces the prob-
lem of ensuring that testing iscom-
prehensive and effective.

The final problem, according

to Crosswhite, is the role of poli-
tics in sports. "It’s a challenge to
have enough politics so that the
Olympics remains in the same
place, but not too much, so that it
remains sport.” He explained that
the “Olympic mystique is what
makes the Olympic games impor-
tant and fascinating.”
Crosswhite praised his
Davidson education and its effects
on his life. “I’m proud to be from
this college. It taught me how to
think, if nothing else. It taught me
Ican have someeffect in the world.”
He admitted he did not have
all the answers to the problems of
international sports but insisted that
heis “astrong believer in the Olym-
pic movement. It is one of the few
things that links nations today.”

Seniors count on apartment

RLO continued from page 1

person in order to get a four-person
apartment or break up the group.

Planning was as important as
luck in the lottery. In addition to
filling out her own application,
seniors like Melissa Ream, whose
apartment mates for the fall are all
abroad this semester, had to com-
plete the application and make sure
that that their deposits were paid.
She says she “worried even though
there were more than enough apart-
ments available because if one per-
son in the group did not pay the
deposit on time then none of us
would get an apartment.”

Among those who were fortu-
nate enough to get Martin F apart-
ments for the fall, there is some
uncertainty about whether the
apartment will be ready. Laura
Jordan was at first “very excited to
get an apartment but later began to

worry because of rumors about.

past apartments not being ready in
time for the start of school.”

Senior Sally Stone, who lives
beside the construction site, has
observed that “the foundation for
the apartment has not yet been laid,
but construction workers have been
working daily from 7 a.m.to6 p.m.
to meet the fall deadline.”

Sink reassures all future Mar-
tin F residents that she has "every
faith that the apartment will be
ready on time.”

The majority of rising seniors
are unconcerned and just glad that
the whole process is over. Sandra
Castle, who will live with three
other women from her freshman
hall, is glad to see their “freshman
plan to get an apartment together
materialize. After planning for an
“apartment, it is good that there are
enough available for all seniors
who want one, so that it no longer
boils down to having good num-

bers.” .

would follow the Davidson model.

The fraternities found the ar-
rangement agreeable, although not
until after some initial balking. The
College charged a yearly rent and
billed each two-room brick house
for light, water, and steam heat
from the College Plant. This was
no problem, but the fact that the
houses had no eating or living fa-
cilities initially bothered many.
Davidson professor and Phi Gam
chapter advisor Thomas Lingle saw
another problem. “A great deal of
publicity has been- given through
the press to the group of eleven
houses,” he wrote in a 1929 frater-
nity periodical: "but this fails to
impress the 64 percent of our stu-
dents who do not belong to frater-
nities, and for whom the college
has provided no social center as
yet. It appears certain that the
present arrangement is drawing a
sharper line between fraternity men
and non-fraternity men than has
ever been drawn before at
Davidson."

Yet the system in practice sat-
isfied students more than expected.
Chapter finances remained low for
years thanks to this system of Col-
lege ownership and maintenance,
claimed a 1934 Alumni Journal
article. Furthermore, keeping all
650 students in the dorms together
allowed independents and the vari-

_ ous fraternity men to get to know

each other beyond chapter bound-

aries. The close proximity of the
court houses also fostered a com-
petitive spirit between houses.
Whether or not the article was right
about that, this period of intense
fraternity activity marked golden
years for almost every chapter and
saw increased academic averages,
a plethora of awards for different
competitions, and highly success-
ful recruitment.

At the same time, fraternities
could have house parties with fe-
male guests, but dances had to stay
in rented facilities in Charlotte.
The success of this arrangement
for the students and for the admin-
istration led to its expansion in the
form of Patterson Court thirty years
later. But Lingle’s fears still per-
sisted: independents remained out-
side the social life. Nothing except
the expansion of college programs
and the growth around Davidson
could alleviate that fact, although
the administration tried.. Today
the abatement of that problem con-
tinues, while fraternities still live
in the same housing arrangement
established here 65 years ago.
