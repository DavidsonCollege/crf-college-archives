America's Place In The New International Order
A Conference on the Post- Cold War World

Former Soviet Ambassador
Opens Dean Rusk Conference

By Meg Davis

Jack F, Matlock, former Am-
bassador to the Soviet Union, gave
the opening address at the confer-
ence sponsored by the Dean Rusk
Program and NationsBank, en-
titled, “America’s Place In The
New International Order: A Con-
ference on the Post-Cold War
World.” Matlock, in accordance
with Walter LaFeber, said he “is
not sure [the new international or-
der] has taken a form,” yet he ex-
pressed the need for a “system
designed to head-.off conflicts be-
fore they occur.”

Jack Matlock received his
A.B. from Duke University and
his M.A. from Columbia Univer-
sity. He taught at Dartmouth be-
fore entering the foreign
servicDirector of the Dean Rusk
Program Jack Perry described him
asa‘‘remarkable linguist.” Matlock
served as Ambassador to Czecho-
slovakia as well as being Ambas-
sador to the Soviet Union from
1987-1991. He is currently a Se-
nior Research Fellow at the
Harriman Institute at Columbia
University. Matlock was the last
single ambassador to serve the
Soviet Union, today there are fif-
teen ambassadors to their fifteen
republics.

Matlock discussed the prob-

lems currently emerging in foreign
policies resulting from the end of
the Cold War. The policies of
security, the world economic sys-
tem, and nationalisms are going to
have to be re-thought since these
problems need to be confronted in
a different manner since a Soviet
superpower is no longer a threat.
In terms of security, Matlock said,
NATO was designed to prevent a
Soviet invasion of Western Eu-
rope. He said that the Soviet threat
to Western Europe no longer ex-
ists, the world needs to devise a
policy to prevent internal conflicts
within the Russian Federation
where communism was an inter-
national ideology which failed to
take into account cultural and eth-
nic identities. Also, the world eco-
nomic system achieved relative
prosperity. during the Cold War,
butitis “inadequate “ to help former
communist economies move into
the present economic system, said
Matlock.

Matlock believes thatthe most
serious problem facing the United
States and the Russian Federation
is the plight of the Russian repub-
lic. He believes the future of the
Russian republic will directly af-
fect the fourteen other republics.
Matlock said that Russiacan make

a successful transition to democ-

tacy and capitalism then the other | ]

republics will follow. Matlock

believes there is a choice for om ee.
Russia’s future between a demo- | J¥

cratic state with a healthy economy
and a totalitarian state, should the
economy collapse. Matlock hopes
for the democratic option because
he believes a strong alliance be-

tween Russia and the United States | ...

would emerge since we do not
have any territorial disputes, the
two countries have never been to
war with each other, and we do not
have any colliding national inter-
ests.

Matlock feels it is imperative
“to start paying attention to what
governments do at home” and to
impose sanctions on countries who
do not recognize human rights or
who have policies of “ethnic
cleansing.” Matlock believes that
the U.S. should imeplement poli-
cies that deny authoritarian re-
gimes the right to purchase arms.
Basically, Matlock said the new
world order needs to be based upon
the principle of democracy, using
more viable criteria than have been
used in the past and denying those
who do not follow these criteria
access and participation in the
world system.

on Future U.S. Foreign Policy |

By Tom Price

Last week two panel presen-
tations of top university professors
were held in Chambers Gallery.
The presentations were part of the
Dean Rusk Program’s conference
on the post-cold war world.

The first session, entitled“‘The
United States and the Emerging
World Economy,” featured Dr.
Anne Krueger, Professor of Eco-
nomics at Duke University and the
former Vice President for Econom-

‘icsand Researchatthe World Bank;
Leon Bendesky, Executive Direc-
tor of the Center for Economic
Studies at the Universidad de las
Americas in Mexico City; and Mr.
Mark Sandy, a 1987 Davidson
graduate and a Luce scholar who
studied U.S.-Japanese trade con-
flicts and plans for a Multilateral
Trade Organization while in To-
kyo last year.

Krueger said the United States
is suffering from “diminished gi-
antsyndrome,” in which the power
of the U.S. dollar has declined.
Countries receiving U.S. aid only
forty years ago are now our great-
est economic competitors. She
outlined the problems the United

States has encountered since its’

emergence after World War II as
the only country with a truly open
economy.

She believes that Congress has
largely forgotten about our multi-
lateral trade system and decides
for itself which forms are trade are
fair and equitable. This system,
Krueger insists, creates barriers to
trade which. are at least equal to
those imposed by Japan. Krueger
also believes it is in the best inter-
est of the U.S. to pursue regional
trade becausethe United States can-
not afford to ignore its neighbors.
Shealso believes this regional trade
needs to be multilateral.

Dr. Bendesky said there are
no justifiable reasons for estab-
lishing new and stable trade agree-
ments. In fact, he argued that there
are not even conditions present for
creating a stable economy.
Globalism in a world economy, he
said, means that nations have less
control over creating a stable inter-
national economy. He traced the
instability of the world economic
scene to the end of economic
growth in the late 1970’s.

Mark Sandy outlined the eco-
nomic problems of the United
States in terms of the challenges
facing President-elect Bill Clinton.

Among these, he said, are increas-

ing the importance of economic
issues, dealing with the greater re-
luctance of the country to sacrifice
economic concerns for political

objectives, and the growing em-
phasis on international competi-
tiveness.

Sandy also described
Clinton’s trade policy as being sup-
portive of free trade in the context
of a national economic strategy.
Clinton’s goal is a high wage, high
growth U.S. economy featuring
government intervention. Sandy
said Clinton also seeks reciprocity
in trade laws and hopes that this
strategy will open up markets. Fi-
nally, Clinton will attempt to em-
phasize the side effects of
trade,such as the environment and
worker safety.

The second panel discussion
was entitled “The United States
and the Emerging World Politics.”
The panel included Dr. Ole Holsti,
Professor of Political Science at
Duke University; Dr. Jereal Rosati,
Professor of Government and In-
ternational Affairs at the Univer-
sity of South Carolina; and Dr.
Loch Johnson, Professor of Politi-
cal Science at the University of
Georgia.

Dr. Holsti shared with the au-
dience segments of his current re-
search. He surveyed over 4,000
“leaders” from around the country
and used their answers to track

inthe post-Cold Warera. The term
“new world order” was coined by
President Bush in1991 and has been
used to describe the current state of
the world after forty years

Cold War presented the possibility
