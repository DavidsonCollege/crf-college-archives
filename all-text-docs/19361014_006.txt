Read any statement
about Chesterfield cigarettes

We tell you what they are made of—mild,
ripe tobaccos. We tell you that we use

on Chesterfield pure cigarette paper.

We tell you that Chesterfields are

carefully manufactured.

We suggest that you try Chesterfields and
find out how mild they are and what a

pleasing taste and aroma they have.

A great many cigarette smokers will
tell you that Chesterfields satisfy—
give them what they want in a cigarette.
