Tri-State Poll Should Be Revealing

With Adlai clobbering the Administra-
tion with an abandon which must make
Harry proud, and Mr. Eisenhower retali-
ating as if he’d never had a bad day in
his life, campus interest in affairs beyond
the city limits is hitting its quadrennial
peak.

No national or international issue
seems to stir undergraduate brainpower
to activity quite so much as a hard-hitting
presidential campaign. And this one
seems to be made to order.

The Democrats have realized all along
that to even come close in November,
they must make enough racket to arouse
some wholesale question in the public
mind about the solidarity of the Eisen-
hower regime. Mr. Stevenson, suddenly
devoid of his 1952 ‘‘eggheadedness’’. is
swinging from the basement, to the joy
of the party’ bosses.

Inside the White House, Ike and the
Republican brass are finally waking up
to the fact that everything is not quite
as-cut-and-dried as it appeared a> few
months ago. Talk of a campaign com-
posed chiefly of a few major TV speeches
to the nation by the President, with Dick
Nixon doing the leg-work and name-call-
ing, has long since ceased.

In essence, this fall will witness a
humdinger of a battle, with nothing shoo-
in about it. Both sides are throwing every-

thing in sight at each other.

The political atmosphere is condusive
to keen interest and discussion among
college students. And both parties fully
recognize the vital importance of the
vote of the youth of the country.

In the next few weeks, the David:°
sonian will attempt to survey the presi-
dential preferences of college students
in Virginia and the Carolinas, believing
that significant trends may be indicated
in a representative cross-section of col-
lege opinion.

This week the feature department has
contacted the editors of 87 college news-
papers in the tri-state area. These news-
papers, who are read by well over 75,000
students, have been asked to poll. their
respective student bodies on their presi-
dential choices.

This data will be returned to us to
be assimilated and compiled, and the re-
sults will be returned to each participa-
ting newspaper for publication during
the last week before the nation goes to
the polls. The total wrap-up of the re-
sults will be featured in the Davidsonian
of November 2.

Now is the time for you as a voter or
potential voter to weigh the candidates
and issues carefully. Though trite to say,
the future of America obviously rests
in the hands of an informed electorate.

Problems Loom For Fraternity System

On Tuesday evening last the ballroom
of the College Union witnessed the initial
discussions of a problem that will in time
affect every fraternity man at Davidson.

The Faculty Committee on Fraterni-
ties, consisting of Dr. W. G. McGavock,
chairman; Dr. Chalmers Davidson, Dr. A.
V. Goldiere, Dr. Harold Ford, and Dean’
Spencer, along with Mr. D. Grier Martin,
met with the presidents and I.F.C. repre-
sentatives of Davidson’s eleven fraterni-
ties and the Campus Club.

The purpose of this meeting was to
study the problems that will arise in con-
nection with fraternities as a result. of
the proposed increase of Davidson's en-
rollment. This meeting was called by Dr.
McGavock to discuss with the fraternities
these problems and possible solutions to
them before any action is. taken by the
Faculty.

This policy of discussing proposed
actions concerning fraternities with them
before any definite plans are made is a
policy that will result in mutual benefits
for both Faculty and fraternities. This
will allow the fraternities to present their
own ideas to the Faculty while at the
same time giving them an. opportunity
to discuss with the Committee its ideas
before they are acted upon.

. Contrary to the belief held in some
circles that the Faculty is anti-fraternity,
it was a welcome relief to discover that
the Committee was most interested in
discussing these problems with the fra-
ternities, interested in hetping them to
find the solutions to them, and interested
even to the point of strengthening the
fraternity system at Davidson.

The Committee presented a number of
proposals concerning these problems for
discussion, and welcomed all suggestions
from the floor. Tuesday evening saw no
final plans adopted. No definite solutions
were agreed upon. No magic formulas
were offered.

The answers to the problems which
confront Davidson’s fraternities because
of the Trustees’ unpopular decision to
increase enrollment are not answers that
can easily be found. Tuesday night was

only a start in the right direction.

A smaller committee of six students,
three fraternity presidents and three
members of the LF.C., will be selected to
work with the Faculty for more detailed
and intensive study.

The Faculty Committee got off to a
good start Tuesday night toward event-
ually finding a solution to the problem.
But the work must not stop with the ap-
pointment of a committee.

It is hoped that the Faculty Committee
on Fraternities will reconvene in the near
future to continue its work. Unless the
Committee does meet again soon, and
thereafter at regular intervals, the
groundwork thus far laid wil! go to waste,
and by the end’ of this school year no
progress will have heen made toward
finding a solution.

If, however, the Committee does meet
again soon to continue its work, a solution
to the problem will be found before the
problem itself becomes unbearable.

P. C. Must Go

Presbyterian College is a nuisance.

They enjoy stealing our freshmen's
hats, for one thing. Been doing it for
years, whenever they come up here for a
football game.

But even more audacious, they take
a peculiar pleasure .in upsetting our foot-
ball team. They've been doing that for
years, too. For no good reason.

Those people down there would rather
beat Davidson than anything they can
think of. Especially at Homecoming.

We're sick of it. P. C. has got to go.
Tomorrow night.

There’s going to be a pep rally back of
the Union tomorrow at noon when the
team pulls out for Clinton. Let’s be there
and let them know we're tired of this
nonsense.

And then let’s follow ’em to P. C. and
be on hand to see things squared away.
It's high time.

What evil in the hearts of men? .

MORE THAN PEOPLE CAN STOMACH

Ending the Draft is Another Dud
Plan by Desperate Mr. Stevenson.

By JACK KERR

Election year is here upon us
again, and as usual, the Democrats
are again promising “the pie in

plus income tax
reductions.”

To any lev-
el-headed __ per-

possible. Of:

Stevenson did say he'd like to do
away with the draft as soon as
possible.

Yes, while talking before
the American Legion Conven-
tion, Mr. Stevenson, suggested
eliminating the draft as soon
as possible. But what does
that mean?

To me, it means no compulsory
service to give my country. But
it also means that our armed
forces would be drastically cut to
the bone, for draftees constitute
more than one-third of the enlist-
ed men in the Army.

TOM MORGAN

(This issue marks the be-
ginning of a regular weekly
column of rambling notes and
occasional essays. Nat Daniel
and Tom Morgan will alternate
as writers. Your comments
and reactions will be appreci-
ated. THE EDITOR.)

To the freshmen: Don't lose
your sense. of balance in the midst
of the barrage of freshmen regu-
lations, name tags. beanies, pep
rallies, hat checks, ete., etc., etc.

As far away as it seems now,
you will someday be an upper-
classman and if you are to get
the most Jout of your college ex-
perience you must plan now to
utilize every year at Davidson to
its fullest advantage.

This includes taking advantage
of those abilities that you have
outside the field of regularly as-
signed classwork. Select one extra-
curricular activity that interests
you and begin now to work up
to a position of leadership in that
field. If you try to get into sev-
eral extra-curriculars, chances are
that you won't make a valuable
contribution in either those activi-
ties or your regular academic ca-
reer.

Don’t let the fact that you are
working in some activity on an
equal basis with upperclassmen
make you feel cocky. You are
still freshmen and if you are to
benefit to the fullest extent from
your education, you must serve
to the fullest extent as a fresh-
man and a pledge.

Show spirit, but at the same time
be respectful of authority and tra-
dition. Remember the adage:. “Be
not the first on whom the new is
tried, nor the last to lay the old
aside.” Freshmen revolutionaries

never get further than the Blue
Room of the College Union!
9 o * °

Speaking of the College Union,
here's a personal to Mr. Murphy.
Don’t you think, sir, that it would
be a bit more sensible to put two
or three extra men behind the
snack bar at rush hours like Sun-
day night at 10 o’clock.

I'm usually a pretty patient fel-
low, but waiting 45 minutes to
get a 10c orangeade would try Job.
The same goes for chapel periods
Monday and Wednesday. The Union
would get much less criticism if
little matters like this were
planned out ahead of time.

e e e e

In return for a little coopera
tion like this from the administra-
tion, I think that we owe them
(and ourselves in this case) a
favor like helping to ease the Ves-
per traffic jam by arriving five
minutes earlier and moving on
down to the front when we enter.
In case of fire the front exit is
still good!

e668? e e

After Vespers on Sunday nights
many of us are missing one of our.
best opportunities to broaden our
college education. Faculty homes
are not open on Sunday nights
just to receive apple-polishers.
Rather, visiting a faculty member
out of the usual classroom atmos-
phere can prove beneficial to both
you and the prof.

You become a personality in-
stead of a name to him, and he
becomes a human being instead
of a machine which doles out 55
minute lectures. Besides, most of
them have very charming families
and @elicious refreshments. This
might solve the problem of the
10 o'clock Union crowds!

‘cause now they won't have to
worry about my having to go back
to Ft. Benning for two years: the
results would be worse than that
— a Direct Invitation to Russia to
move as she pleases and where
she pleases!

It’s not enough for Mr. Ste-
venson to criticize the Eisen-
hower Administration for
casually dismissing his pro-
posal last spring to halt further
testing of large nuclear de-
vices. Now he wants us to stop
rearming!

He may not say so in black and
white, but I've yet to see the U. S.
raise an adequate fighting force
on volunteers alone as he pro-
poses.

DIDN’T LEARN LESSON
Didn't we learn our lesson at
Pearl Harbor? Evidently not. How
‘bout Korea? Again we found our-
selves not adequately armed; how-
ever, we were in the process of

building up our armed might.

Now all we have to do is
to let this “all’s well if you
vote for me, right now we're
going to Hell” philosophic
bug bite us and then we'd
have a repeat performance of
Pear! Harbor, unless you have
more faith in Russia’s sinceri-
ty than | do.

Lieutenant General W. K. Har-
rison stated that if persons assume
that the policy makers of Russia
are honorable men then we will
be destroyed. But after all “ole’
soldiers just fade away,” so what
do those utterances mean?
Nothing, if men think they don’t
mean anything.

HOLD RUSSIA AT BAY

But to me the only safe way
to hold Russia at bay is the con-
tinued build-up of our. relatively
high military strength and readi-
ness. Weaken those, and we will
be inviting a devastating attack
against our own country. Mr. Ste-
venson’s suggestion is just what
Russia wants — she wants nations
to trust her. Then, once they have
subsided, the knife is used.

Historically, until efter the
beginning of the Korean War,
we have refused to face the
threat of war until after we
have found ourselves actually
engaged in combat. The utter
unveadiness of the United
States for World Wer It is
common knowledge.

Fortunately, the resistance of
the British and French gave us
time to prepare after we entered
Second World War. But if there's
a next time we’ll have no time to
prepare if we aren’t already armed
to the teeth.

Therefore, Mr. Stevenson, the
next time you make a proposal
please think about your duds of
the 1952 campaign in which you
promiseg, the people more than
they could stomach; all of which
are ridiculous.

EDITOR'S MAILBOX

Cheer Up! Maltby’s
Music’s Among Best

Dear Sir:

Upon returning to Campus [ast
Friday night, following an evening
in “the wicked city,” 1 found that
the first phrase which met my ears
was: “Who's this guy Maltby?”

This seems to have been the
most asked question since that
time, and it is often accompanied
by something like: “For that price
we should at least have a decent
orchestra!’

Some seem te object to the
1.F.C.’c choice merely on the
grounds that his orchestra
does not have a big name,
conceding that the music may
be good, while others have de-
cided that the whole weekend
is destined to be a flop be-
cause we will not be blessed
with Les Elgart or Stan Ken-
ton.

I myself certainly do not claim
to be a music critic, or to speak
for anyone else, but, believe it
or not, I have heard: of this band,
and have enjoyed it very much.

Their recording of “Midnight
Mood” was among the top ten
around home for over two months
last year.

‘

Also, I may toss in this bit of
information for what it is worth
~—Syracuse University had Malt-
by for one of its weekends a year
ur so ago, and, though I cannot
say much for the school academi-
cally, its, 13,000 students do en-
joy quite a social life. and scem
to have been well pleased with
“Poor Richard's” offerings.

I think that one thing which
you will find about the music
is this — it is danceable, and

dancing is, after ail, supposed:
ly one of the main objectives
of these get-togethers with
our friends from Queens,
W.C., Salem, ete.

At least I am sure Maltby will
not feel: as if “Well, here is a little
one-horse school, now we can try
out all that experimental stuff and
get some practice on it,” as 1
have been told others have done.

Admittedly. all, or at least al-
most all, of us would rather write
to that girl with the news that.
we are going to have a big name,
and that thus she simply must
come to hear him, but I'm sure
that if she really wants to come,
she will do so, whether its Maitby
or Ray Anthony.

At least we'll know if its
us or the orchestra’s name
she wants to be with.

Cost. is another angle. For those
who are on a pretty close budget,
this orchestra at half. the price
of many others is certainly a wel-
come thqught. Surely as far as
the quality of the music itself goes,
I cannot see the great differences
in prices.

The sum of all I've been try-
ing to say might be put like this:
“Cheer up, Twill be better than
you think.” Don't gripe so much
because you've never heard of
the Richard Maltby Orchestra be-
fore — I think you will many times
in the future.

The IFC has done what they
consider to be the best thing, and
I, for one -at least, am not dis-
pleased with their choice.

Charlotte Musical Groups
Include Symphony And Song

Dear Sir:

We are fortunate to find our-
selves in a. wonderful material-
istic machine age. Every dorm hall
vibrates to cross rhythms from the
ubiquitous hi-fi.

Beethoven, Adler, Bach, Rodgers
come screaming 20 to 15,000 cycles
from tangled rigs of pre-amps,
woofers, and tweeders which, as
“Play Boy” assures us, is as much
a part of the college man’s pos-
sessions as the 3-button coat.

But let us not forget that some-
where in the past a real orchestra
played the music that was caught
in those wonderful disc-cans; an

IF SOUTH SECEDES
MISS AMERICA
GOES WITH US

“Was this the face that
launched a thousand ships

And burned the topless towers
of Nium?”

THE NEWS and Courier warns
that it doesn't take secession talk
seriously but “if the South should
secede we intend to take Miss
America with us.”

That goes for No. 3, too,—Anne
Ariail of Alabama, whose name
runs so musically with her: state's.
that she must surely be a states
rightist. .

What would the Supreme Court
say of its handiwork then? How
explain the bitterly unconstitution.
al loss of Anne Ariail and Marian
McKnight—two-thirds of a nation's
whole triumvirate of charm, talent
and tape - recording? What psy-
chology would save then the
Nervous Nine who held hands and
jumped?

Helen of Troy, the goddess re-
duced to human — too human—
form, caused a thousand ships to
be launched and many men to die.
Immortal in story is the expedi-
tionary force with which the Greeks
tried to retake her to her husband
and the wooden horse trick with
which they succeeded and burned
Troy.

Will Atlanta burn again—and
this time for beauty’s sake? Will
Sumter be fired on once more—
and now because of a woman fair?

Charleston (S.C) News and
Courier.)

orchestra made up of living, breath-
ing human beings, who through
their fiddles and flutes keep the
composer from being bound to

marticulate manuscript. ;

But when these fiddlers and
flutists brought their art to the
cannery, they became annony-
mous, their art became immutable,
indetible-captured on black vinyl
forever.

Charlotte has three or four
musical groups which give sev-
eral programs each year. The
Charlotte Symphony performs
music of high quality in five
subscription concerts and «
number of student concerts
each year.

That group ‘doesn't sound ex-
actly like the Boston or Vienna.
but it doesn't claim to, or even
need to. The fact is that it is a
live, functioning body of think-
ing musicians who come together
surely because they want to (for
the pay is not tempting) to re.
create the treasures of the art.

Dr. James C. Pfohl, one time
head of the Davidson music depart-
ment, presents interesting, well
planned programs, not afraid of
the more difficult works and be.
lieving that contemporary works
should be performed along with
the older accepted ones.

On October 16, Mildred Mil-
ler and Brian Sullivan will
appear with the orchestra to
sing, excerpts from Carmen
and works by Wagner, Lalo,
and Mozart,

The orchestra plays the over-
ture to Russian end Ludmilla by
Glinka, a contemporary work for
orchestra ond 10 percussionists by
Georgia-native Wallingford Rieg-
gar called Dance Rhythms, and
concluding with the Capriccio
Italien, the old warhorse which all
hi-fiers know at least from
memory.

The concerts are held in the
new David Ovens Auditorium.

Mr. Earl Berg, also at one
time on the D. C. faculty, con-
ducts the Charlotte Oratory
singers in two programs this
year. Mr. Berg is perhaps the
keenest and most sensitive
musician around and you have
to go a long way to hear an
equal to his excellent chorus.

In Charlotte also is an Opera
group and a Chamber Music Socie-
ty which brings chamber ensem-
bles to those who enjoy that more
intimate form of music.
