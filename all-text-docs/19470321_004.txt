It is a good place to stand. But the

othe soldier—goes—into

but it shall not come nigh thee,”
A woman in distress remembers the
line, “Underneath are the everlast-
ing arms.’ Aj sick man recalls the
promise, “As thy days, so shall thy
strength be.” One burdened in con-
science, hardly yet repentant, catch-
es the phrase, “Her iniquity is par-
doned.” A young persdn in a jam
(ike the woman in Dorothy Park-
er’s tragic little satire) remembers
a phrase heard in church, “If ye
ask anything in my name, I will
do it,” and prays in Christ's name
jor the ringing of the telephone.
And then, perhaps, the soldier gets
killed, first man down; the woman
in distress does not feel the ever-
lasting arms; the sick man grows
weaker; the sinner feels no peace;
the telephoire does not ring. Are all
the promises hollow?

One who has been shocked by the
apparent of of

Bible’s promises may take the trou-

failure one the

ble to look up the passage again.
He may this time look about him
beyond the immediate words to see
to whom and when and why the
promise was made. In other words,
he becomes historically minded, he

+-Gonsiders the passages in their con-

text of place, time and purpose.
When he does this he may becocme
discouraged about all the promises.
How few of them seem to bear
one’s own name! “But it shall not
come nigh thee” could certainly not
have been meant for every: one,
even in the poet’s mind, otherwise
no believer in God would ever get
hurt. “Underneath are the everlast-
ing arms” was spoken to the nation
of Israel; and again it is to Israel
that strength is promised according
to her days. The pardoned iniquity
of Isaiah 40 is that of the city of
Jerusalem. The people who are pro-
mised an answer in Jesus’ name are
eleven of the original disciples .. .
And so forth.

The Bible Reader at. this point
may give up his faith in the prom-
ises. Granted these are divine words,
granted their absolute truth, what
good does that do me? How stupid
it is (the reader may think) to rely
on a promise made to someone else
altogether, under entirely different
circumstances! As well expect to
receive a fat check this afternoon
because a note was signed by one
Frenchman to another two centuries
ago, as to claim a promise from a
remoter century, a farther contin-

He will bear your weight, the bur-

can be said to you too, you of the

a city laid waste by sword and fire,
sick of their sins, despairing of res-
cue, the prophet could say, “Her
iniquity is forgiven,” then the brok-

from innocence,even now may hear
the voice trom the shadows of
Calvary, “Father, forgive them...
This day shalt thou be with me.”
lf the disciples in the Upper Room
could so learn the mind of Christ
that they would. ask only what he
would ask, then indeed he would
‘do it; and you too, if you learn the
mind of Christ, even if-your request
goes without answer/and you must
taste the cup of dread, you shall be
able to pray as he did, “Not my
will, but Thine, be done.”

The promises of God are from
eternity,-but they can never grow
old. They are for the men and wo-
men of faith in every time, in every
place. They have not given out nor
worn thin, they are yours. Call the
roll of faith: is your name written
there? “These all... received not
the promises, God having provided
some better things for us, that a-
part from us they should not be
made perfect ... for himself hath
said: ‘I will in no wise fail thee,
neither will I in any wise forsake
thee.’” The writer to the Hebrews
knew very “well that that promise
had been made to men long-since
dead, But he knew the promise still
lived:

“So that with good courage we

say: The Lord is my helper: I will

“A GOOD PLACE TO EAT”

Chappell Praised
For Leadership Of

Spring -

This past week Davidson students
again had the privilege of hearing
an inspired speaker and minister in
a series of six services. The Spring
Services, this year conducted by
Dr. Ctovis G. Chappell, :pastor of
the First Methodist Church Char-
lotte, were outstanding not only as
religious but also in the
larger school activities.
The interest and attendance were
perhaps as good and widespread
this spring as at any fall or ‘spring
services in history.

realm

Davidson's
Dr. Chappell’s messages have been
summed up by himself in the fol-
lowing phrases and sentences:
Tuesday morning—‘Making
useless within us useful.”
“The direction of
life, what are we becoming?”
Wednesday morning—‘“There are
some things that you should fear
but most things are not worthy of
fear, namely: Fear of self, of mak-
ing a mistake, and of work.”
Wednesday night—The invitation
that Christ extends to us to let Him
carry our burdens, Christ being will-
ing to shoulder the heavy end.”
Thursday morning—‘The joys of
a beautiful friendship with God.”

Tuesday night

Thursday night—‘The — strength
and beauty gained by rebirth
through Christ.”

Opportunity
As usual, when there is an op-
portunity offered to many, some

take advantage of it and othert be-
cause of varying attitudes either
do or will not. There is no doubt
that hearing Dr. Chappell has been
an opportunity. Several members
of the student body have been ask-
ed their opinions as to the effective-
ness of Dr. Chappell and the real-
ness of the opportunity, Their opin-

ions jare listed.

The Upward Look

by Tom Powell

A new twist to an ageless human
failing appeared not long ago in the
‘Picturesque Speech’ section of
“The Reader’s Digest. The tendency
to “soldier on the job”, so promi-
nent in human nature, was aptly
termed rusting, rather than resting,
on our laurels. Were we to devote a
moment's consideration to this so-
called new twist, we might easily
realize certain truths not evident
in the old, accepted phrase.

A prominent business man re-
cently remarked that. we, as_ indi-
viduals, either go forward or back-
ward—we are unable to hold our
place in the sun, regardless of the

time and effort expended in attain”

ing that place, simpty by standing
still; for in so doing, we necessarily
find our position outdistanced by
those whose earnest and diligent
application to the task at hand re-
sult in the development of superior
ability.

In a recent tract meet a famed
middle-distance runner, having tak-
en the lead at the start of the
quarter-mile run and held it enter-
ing the head-of the home stretcch,
suddenly decided to turn his head
to the side momentarily to look at
the runners behind. In so doing, he
broké his stride and lost the rack,
his first defeat in four years, to one
who kept running through to the
end. In short, the individual choos-
ing to rest on his laurels will sacri-
fice at one fell swoop his past ef-
forts and his chance of future a-
chievement.

Not that we should forgo taking
inventory, of our individual accom-
plishments and resources—that isa
Practice which the demands of
custom and usage have made stand-
ard operating procedure, Nor should
we deny ourselves a sense of per-
sonal pride-and satisfaction ior A
job well done, for a balance sheet
which gives evidence that we have
made a Wisé-distribution of our in-
dividual natural resources. The
danger lies in our becoming satis-
fied to rely upon the status quo as
being sufficient to carry us through.
When we demonstrate such satis-
faction, we, as Dr. Chappell pointed
out, cease to grow. Then the words
of the businessman heretofore
mentioned take on the full force of
‘their implication. When we cease to
8row, we ‘necessarily become de-
cadent and obsolete.

Rather should the Period of re-
capitulation be completed by.a new
budget, a new plan_ pr viding for
a more efficient allocation of our

indivtlual resources looking toward
greater Then, and
only then, will we continue to grow
in mind and in spirit.

achievements.

Now why the question anyway?
Why should we trouble ourselves
about this matter of steadfast de-
votion to the attainment of greater
and still greater achievements? The
problem that we face is, in its simp-
list form, that of owning up to and
meeting our debts to society, to
family, to ourselves, and to God?
AS men we cannot, indeed we must
not, fail in the liquidation of our
debts.

We are members of the society
of mankind and, as such, must con-
tribute our share toward that
society's perpetuation and general
welfare. By our share is meant tak-
ing advantage of every opportunity
to render a service to society that
will represent our best efforts. Paul,
in his letter to the Galatians, says,
‘As we have opportunity, let us
Strive to do good unto all men.”

Dr. Chappell pointed out the debt
we owe to our family. You recall
that he said that “we should be a-
fraid-to~ disappoint our parents”.
Their hopes, their prayers, their
very. lives are wrapped up in us,
When we stop growing in mind and
spirit, we default in the remainder
of payments due this
debt of ours.

on family

We owe it to ourselves to realize
the utmost of our capabilities. A
Philosopher once remarked that man
should have a goal, an aim in life
so high as to be forever just out
of his reach, though he hitch his
wagon to a star during the course
of the race- Such an aim would
safe guard from rust the laurels
achieved along the way. We cannot
forget that we are held accountable
for our best performance. You re-
member the words of Paul-when he
said, “Be not deceived; God is not
mocked; for whatsoever a
soweth, that shall he reap.”

Finally, there is the debt we owe
to God. When we pray that “God's
will be done-on-earth-as~it-is~in
heaven”, we ask that God’s will be
done in us. This request bears re-
sponsibility too great to be cast a-
side. The Apostle Paul never paused
to look behind, never broke his
stride--We might well profit by his
example when he said, “This- one
thing I do, forgetting those things
which are behind, and~ reaching
forth unto those things which are
before, I press toward the mark
for the prize of the high calling of
God in Christ Tecne”
