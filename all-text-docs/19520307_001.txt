Will Redecorate
Phi Hall, Stage
Chapel Program

As Phi.Hall struggled to remain
afloat Monday night, President Jack
Stevenson called to order a mecting
which witnessed plans for the re-
decoration of Phi Hall and for a
Phi chapel program. Members of
the society also heard papers read
by four students seeking fellowship
in Phi.

Discussion on redecorating Phi
Hall led to the formation of a re-
search committee whose purpose it
is to insure the authenticy of Phi’s
new: interior, keeping decoration
within the tradition of Phi’s chan-
delier.

The “indiscriminate splashing
of a sickly spinach green without
regard for taste or tradition, as has
been done in less civilized circles,”
is to be alleviated by the student of
the committee on research.

President Stevenson appoint-
ed a committee on asthetics
and culture to plan a chapel
program “expressing deep con-
cern over the depths to which
chapel entertainment and con-
duct has fallen as evidenced by
a recent maudlin display of in-
fantile exhibitionism by a pur-
portedly literary group of ill
repute, sometimes referred to as
the You. May - Need - Them
Society.”

Students seeking membership in
the Phi by the reading of their in-
dividual compositions were Cortez
Cooper, Swain Loy, Austin Strand,
and Fred Allen.

Cortez Cooper read his out-
look on the conditions we face
and the world situation in
“"1952—-What Price Peace.”
Swain Loy, in “The Awful
Vice,” described the movie in-
dustry and its effects on
society.

Fred Allen closed the readings
with his paper, “The Story of Ma-
guss and Sullus,” a sidelight on the
eruption at Pompeii.

ROTC Seniors
To Get Huny
Call To Army

Those students who graduatc
from college this year with Re-
serve Commissions from the
ROTC will be called into active
service for 24 months as lieutenants.
This is identical to the cail that
was made for last year's class.

The Army plans to call about a
third of the entire group in each
of July,-August and September, In-
so far as possible, officers will be
called in the month of their choice.

If they wish to go in June, it is
expected that this can be arranged.

Those officers who had two con-
secutive years of service, as an en-
listed man in World War II will
not be required to go.

If a student does not grad-
uate, but is awarded his com-
mission at the usual time, he
will not have to go into the
Army until he either graduates
from, or withdraws from, col-
lege.

There is a third group which,
although they may be called, will
not have to go into the Army, in
all probability. These are students
going on to graduate school in
either medicine or theology, or re-
lated fields of study.

Upon receipt of orders,
which the Army plans will be
as the student prepares to
leave college at the conclusion
of this year's activities, the of-
ficer desiring deferment should
submit a request to be excused
to the Chief of the Military
District in which the officer’s
residence is located.

The PMS&T intends to discuss
the entire matter in detail with the
students concerned in the near fu-
ture.

Faculty Gives OK
To Reorganization
Of Faculty Comm.

At the faculty meeting last Tues-
day the members of the faculty
approved the idea of re-establish.

mittee, which went out of existence
some yeats ago. This committee,
which is a gathering for student
and faculty representatives for the
voicing of opinions on relative mat-
ters, is provided for in the constitu-
tion of the student body; but for
a number of years it has not been
in effect.

The committee will coptain, at
present, three members of the
faculty to be appointed next week
by Dr. Cunningham, the presidents
of the senior, junior and sopho-
more classes, a man selected by

The ten-week series of programs began last week over WBT,

WPTF, and WBIG, each show

a quarter of an hour in length.

In the future they are to run over WISE, WMNC, and WSIC. The
above photo shows the band in a recording session, with the WBT

tape recording team at left.

The band is one of two such or-
ganizations in the entire country
to be invited to play for the con-
vention, which will have approxi-
mately 5,000 delegates. The other
band will be the nationally famous
University of Michigan Concert
Band.

The Davidson group, which
is composed of 54 musicians,
has been honored numerous
times in the past few years. Be-
fore the war it played weekly
concerts over the Dixie Net-
work of the Columbia Broad-
casting System.

Two years ago, it played for the
National Convention of the Ameri-
can Bandmasters Association, and
last year it was the only college
group to be invited to play | for

ference in Richmond, Virginia.

Tonight the band enters its
second transcribed concert over

Close-Up Of “The Reverend”
Ben Rose Has Personal Touch, Eagerness

Which Won Bristol Church At First Sermon

By ALLEN VANCE

With the close of the last war
my hometown of Bristol, Tennes-
see, prepared itself for the return
to,a normal and peaceful way of
life. My church, the Central Pres-
byterian, besides being involved in
this change, was looking for a
pastor,

Our former pastor, the late Dr.

Donald McIver, had retired from ,

the ministry after more than 40
years aS an active minister.

One Sunday in January of 1946,
a tall, thin, redheaded young man
delivered the morning's sermon.
The man's name was Ben Lacy
Rose, who had served as a chaplain
in Europe during the war.

I don't remember the topic of the
sermon but I do remember that
everyone in the congregation de-
cided that he was the man for Cen-
tral Church. —

Within a short time we had ex-
tended a call to him and we were
rewarded with his acceptance.

Ben Rose took up his duties
with an eagerness that has

never abated. Soon after he
took over we began a drive to
raise funds for the building of
the new church which we now
occupy.

With him as our leader we
reached our goal and in doing so
realized our dream of many years.

“The Reverend,” as he is
called by our young members,
possibly made himself felt more
in our young peoples work.
This was the part of the church
that most needed a boost.

He put the whole department on
its feet and has kept it running ef-
ficiently ever since. I cannot say
his appeal is only to the younger
set, though, for he is the under-
standing and invigorating type of
speaker who can hold an audience
of any age in his grasp.

The large reserve of stories and
vivid illustrations which Dr. Rose
uses frequently in his sermons are
partly responsible for his wide-
spread popularity.

Also I think you will find, as
I have, that he gives you the

West Point
Invites Reps

From D.C. Unit

The Department of the Army has
announced that two ROTC students
from each of many ROTC units
around the country will be invited
to visit the United States Military
Academy for a brief orientation
and information period during the
next two months.

Davidson College has been as-
signed the period 1-4 May, which
is a Thursday-Sunday period.

Although the directive is not
altogether clear on the point,
it is believed cadets would leave
here in euch time as to arrive
at West Point early Thursday
afternoon and that they would
leave there early Sunday after-
noon,

Travel; which will probably be
by train, will be paid for by the
government. The cadets will have
to pay for other expenses, includ-
ing meals. The. Superintendent of
the Military Academy has written
that the whole charge to the cadets
should not excced $7.00.

The invitation is not re-
stricted to members of the
senior class. It is to all mem-
bers of all four ROTC classes.
Nominations by the PMS&T
must be made by the first week

feeling that he is talking to you,
the individual, and who among
us doesn’t like this personal
touch found in too few of to-
day’s preachers?

I predict that these coming
Spring services will be a source: of
spiritual strength for each and
everyone of us, I hope that you,
the students, will back up my pre-
diction after hearing “The Rev-
erend.”

Launch Services Pick Leaders
Sunday Evening; lor Forums
Frat Talks F ollow At Y Parleys

With an extensive program of fraternity house and dornii-
tory discussion complementing addresses by Rev. Ben L. Rose, the

annual Spring Services will be

opened to their theme, ‘What

Think Ye of Christ?’ at the vesper service Sunday evening.

Following the discussion group
which was successfully introduced
at Fall Services last November, the
YMCA special services commission
under Tom Stockton is bringing 11
ministers to lead the sessions again.

Fraternity house discussions
will supplement the dorm
groups this spring, the former
meetings to be held from 7-8
p.m. Monday and Tuesday and
the latter at 10:30 Sunday,
Monday and Tuesday evenings.
Rev. Rose, in additon to his

opening sermon Sunday night, will
deliver his message Monday, Tues-
day, and Wednesday mornings in
chapel,

In a deviation from prece-
dent, the principal speaker will
not preach on Monday, Tues-
day, and Wednesday nights.
The fraternity discussion
groups, guided by Rose’s morn-
ing message, will take the place
of the evening talk.

Discussion leaders will be ad-
vised to direct the line of thought
Monday night along the theme,
“Our Christian Beliefs,” and Tues-
day night to center talk about
“Christian Morality.”

As has been the case in past
years, chapel will begin at 10:10
rather than 10:20, the first two
periods being shortened five
minutes.

BS Big

Favorite

In U.S. Colleges

Davidson degree-scekers are following true to form with
fellow students all over the country. Of 123 seniors, 110 are
candidates for the BS Degree, but only 13 are working toward

the AB ticket.

This proportion is carried on
down through the classes where
records show 78 undergraduates ap-
plying for AB and 600 for BS.

Roth Registrar F. W. Hengeveld
and President J. R. Cunningham
agreed that this increase of men
interested in BS diplomas was not
a localized tendency but visible all
over the nation.

As a possible reason it was
suggested by Hengeveld that
perhaps an increased stress on
the specialized and the practi-
cal in public school systems was
forcing the colleges to educate
men in narrower fields.

He added that as a consequence
most professional schools no longer
require a heavy load of the classics.

“Most of the AB candidates are
pre-ministerial and have to be
trained in Greek and Latin," noted
Hengeveld. He remarked that mod-
ern college students don't seem to
see any need of those languages
any more as a part of their edu-
cation.

He revealed that Duke Uni-
versity tags nearly all but a
few very specialized graduates
AB. “We have had to fight
pressure here to make David-
son's AB Degree a more gen-
eraf award like that of Duke,”
he reported. Dr. Cunningham
verified this.

Hengeveld stated that in his
opinion a liberal arts college should
exist more to teach students to
jive and become adjusted to society
than how to make a living.

Dr. Cunningham cited a broader
interest in the sciences as one
reason for the greater number of
BS students.

Student Forum
Touches Politics,
Honor Systems

Student leaders from four col-
leges exchanged ideas at a YMCA
panel discussion on student gov-
ernment problems here Wednesday
night.

Discussion centered around three

-miain topics—constitutional setup,

elections, and the honor system.
The Wofford delegation revealed
that their school has no honor sys-
tem, but does have open elections.

Although they believed that
the introduction of an honor
system might affect their elec-
toral system to an extent, they
nevertheless strongly advocated
the open election system, with
campaigning and posters, be-
cause in this way interest. in-
creased and issues on the cam-
pus were sharpened.

Davidson students in attendance
seemed divided on how far to go
in altering our present electoral
setup, but all agreed that some
changes should be made.

Dot McLeod, president of the
Queens Student Council, revealed
that a similar movement to allow
a mild form of campaigning is
gaining popularity there.

Instead of an honor system,
Wofford has a monitor system
and paid, officers on each hall
to maintain order. They are
currently trying to install an
honor system, although euch
a move was rejected by the
student body last spring.
Although only 15 Davidson stu-

dents were in attendance, Hubert
Cannon, moderator of the discus-
sion, said he considered the eve-
ning a success.

Besides the Davidson aggrega-
tion, which included Mac McLean
and Tom Stockton on the panel.
The Converse delegation con-
sisted of Polly Glenn, president of
the student body, and Susanne
Earnhardt, vice president, while
Wofford was represented by George
Smith, president of the junior class,
and Jimmy Holler, president of the
sophomore class.
