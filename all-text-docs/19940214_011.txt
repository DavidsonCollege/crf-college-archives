Stephen Sandy
gives life to
modern poetry

By Matt Smith

On Thursday, February 10, at 4:30 p.m., the
Literary Arts Committee, under the direction of Bailey
Foster, hosted its last guest of the year in the 900
Room. Visiting Professor Stephen Sandy gave an
introspective reading of his poetry to both students
and faculty.

Sandy is the McGee Visiting Professor of Writ-
ing at Davidson this semester and teaches a course in
modern American poetry as well as a poetry writing
workshop. He received a Ph.D. from Harvard Uni-
versity and has taught at Harvard, Brown, and
Bennington College, where he has founded the
Bennington Writing Workshops. In addition, he has
taught and studied in Japan under a Fulbright Schol-
arship—an experience which often manages to find
its way into his poetry in some form.

Sandy has written six volumes of poetry to date.
The majority of the works read on Thursday came
from his last three collections: Greylock (1983), Man
in the Open Air (1988), and Thanksgiving Over the
Water (1992).

Peter Davison accurately describes Sandy as, “a
poet who studies the disconnections of sensation from
a consciousness to discover, in his own words, ‘ordi-
nary experience on a higher plane.’” In his writing,
Sandy renders the human experience in the form of
concrete, everyday items such as a used car, a stuffed
decoy duck, a mirror, or a sign.

However, under the light of Sandy’s imagina-
tion, such items take on an almost mythical signifi-
cance. They are the components of our lives, the

small blocks from which we construct them. They are
as varied as they are meaningful.

The subjects of Sandy’s poems range from birth
to a death, from the innocence and wonder of child-
hood to the more experienced humor and cynicism of

adulthood. Vietnam, the coming of spring, cancer—
are all addressed in his poetry with a piercing insight
and wryness that is lost in the work of many other
poets who tackle subjects on a more spiritual plane.
What Sandy realizes (where others have failed) is that
the everyday is itself that higher plane. One need look
no further.

After the reading, Professor Sandy remained to
sign books and answer questions from the audience.
Sandy joins a long list of distinguished authors who
have visited Davidson this academic year, including
novelist Tim McLaurin, poet Alan Shapiro, and short
story writer Rebecca McClanahan.

For their next project, the Literary Arts Commit-
tee will host an “open-mic” FAC, tentatively sched-

uled for March 4. Students and Faculty alike will be ©

invited to read their own works.

they must be getting funkier be-
cause malls, catalogues, and those
kinds of places are starting to carry
cooler shoes ‘cause that’s just
what’s hip now.”

David Moore: “Personally I
could care less—people should
wear what they want to wear. I
can’t understand why anyone
would care about someone else’s
shoes.”

Finally my favorite quote
which sums up how I feel about
this article, was given to me by a

the dumbest idea I’ve ever heard.
Platform shoes are ugly and you
are only writing this article for
self-glorification, so why don’t you
shut up and buy some sensible
shoes like a normal person?!”
Maybe a nice pair of Hush
Puppies...what do you think?

Dancers tip-toe to music

By Tom Mew

Aspiring dancers on campus
now have a unique opportunity to
develop and showcase their talent.
The newly reorganized Dance
Troupe is currently seeking addi-
tional members for a recital on
April 2.

The Dance Troupe, which was
first created in the mid-1970s, is
being re-organzied under the lead-
ership of Laura Leibfreid and Sh-
annon Simmons. Leibfreid de-
scribes the Troupe’s style as “con-
temporary, ballet-based dance.”

The Troupe’s upcoming per-
formance will feature a variety of
modern dances. In addition to per-

formances, they will also host spe-
cial guest teachers to provide fur-
ther assistance and instruction.

Leibfreid notes that currently
the group’s membership is small
and encourages new dancers to
join.

Reflecting on the number of
dancers on campus, Leibfreid says
that she hopes more of them will
get involved with the Troupe,
which meets on Sundays in Baker,
from 4:00-5:30 p.m.

No experience is necessary
and all interested persons are en-
couraged to attend. Their April
performance will be in Love Audi-
torium at 7:30 p.m.

A tribute to country heroes

Geoffcontinued from page 10

__ So, next time you’re in Home
Town Records and the new Reba
or Tanya catches your eye, hold
back and take a look at the heroes

- of ten or twenty years ago. Take a

. look at Kenny Rogers, Jimmy Buf-
fet, and Willie Nelson. Don’t pass
up a good deal on Keith Whitley’s
Greatest Hits. These are the artists

who sang the “Killin’ Times” and
“Chattahoochees” of decades past,
and these timeless songs just don’t
grow old.

Thanks again'to everyone that
made the third annual “Cold Bev-
erages and Country Music” party
possible—especially the DJs, Of-
ficer Dane Laney, and all those
women willing to dance with me.

I’ll see you there next year.
