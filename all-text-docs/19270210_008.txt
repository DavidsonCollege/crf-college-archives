(Continued from page 4)

When we learn that, taken together
and considered as one, they constitute
one of the greatest of all adventures, we
shall get a clearer idea of what college
is all about. Let us realize that we play
|games, not produce championship

to

/and to sense the kingliness of sport in all
lages; let us realize that we work on col-
| lege committees, not to be “big men,” but
to rub shoulders with our fellows and to
| grasp something of the magic of co-

take courses, not to “pass examinations,”
but to win through the stimulus of intel-
lectual contact rewards that will refresh

‘teams, but to quicken the pulse of life.

jonly information available at present is

lof the evening will be made by some

talks given by members of the class.

There are certain other unique features

a complete surprise to everyone.

The decorating committee has decided
to have the entire place arranged to that
the red and black of the school will be

The members of the local chapter of the
Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity were agreeably
surprised on Saturday afternoon by a social
visit made them by three of the members of
the Supreme Council of their fraternity.
This was quite an honor as three df them
came at one time,’ and because a fraternity| ff
is usually considered to be lucky when even
one of their officers visits them. The names
of the officers who visited the Davidson
chapter are as follows:
