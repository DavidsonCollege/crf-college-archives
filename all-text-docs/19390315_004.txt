To open the discussion in an off-season vein, Bill Davis, star Wild-
cat back last fall, had the distinction of returning more punts than any
other leather-lugger in the United States during the football
just past. The Badin Bearcat returned forty punts in ten

To get back to individual performances during the past year's
grid wars, our own Bill Davis was ranked eleventh in the entire
country, counting every offensive department of play. He ran, kick-
ed, and passed better than some 509 other backs whose achieve-
ments were recorded and turned over to this statistical bureau.
Further proof of Bill’s durability is found in the fact that he parti-
cipated in more plays than any other man in the southeast—that
is, he either ran, passed, or punted more often than any other back

TENNIS TEAM TAKES OFF
The tennis boys are really taking a trip during the spring holidays—
Atlanta, Memphis, Dallas, Austin, and surrounding territory. They should
have a fine team this year with enough new material to fill the gradua-
tion gaps. Their real trouble on the tour will come when they tangle

Shepard Puts Frosh Through
Light Workouts

For over a week now about thir-
ty freshmen baseball aspirants have
been working out daily with Coach
Norman Shepard on the lower field.

The first week's
sisted of loosening up arms, bunt-
ing, and hitting on Thurs-
day and Friday. Tuesday of this
week the squad was cut and uni-

some

forms were issued.

The biggest problem which pre-
itself to Coach Shepard
that of the batteries. Pitchers and
catchers are sorely needed. It looks
as though the race for infield posts
is going to be a merfy one. Carter
and Caldwell are two outstanding
candidates for the initial sack. Sim-
onds, Yarborough, Nelson, Owens,
and Washburn are a few of the
boys who will battle for 2nd, 3rd,
and short-stop.. Morris, Smith,
Stair, Clark, Thmoas, Daffin, Me-
Kinnon, Dillard, and Kistling are
fighting for the privilege of roam-
ing the outer gardens.

It is exp€cted that a,short prac-
tice game will be played between
