A history of Davidson radio

From carrier-current to ry OF powerhouse

By JON BOLES

Recent changes in the prog- -

ramming schedule of. WDAV
have led to protest on the part of
students, who see the station as
“something: of their own” and
claim that the administration’ s de-
cision to change to an all-classical
format is another step in a long
progression designed to take
WDAYV from the students. Is this a

valid charge? After taking a look -

back at the history of the station, it
would appear’so.

WDAV first appeared on the
scene in 1969 as a carrier-current
station, which means that students
received it on AM radio by plug-
ging their radios into AC outlets.
Students conceived and ran the
entire operation.

In the spring of 1973, the FC@
gzanted WDAV a construction
permit allowing the students to
-buy the equipment for and to build
“a ten-watt FM station. At the time,
North Mecklenberg county had no
radio station.:

The crossover from AM to FM
led to a reevaluation and broaden-
ing of the station’s purpose. A
member of WDAV’s staff com-
mented, “the station’s primary
purpose has been to provide a
music service to the stu-
dents . . [in the future we] will
have increased responsibilities to
the law and to our community,”
such as providing more news.

One aspect of these changes

_ was. an alteration in the format of

the station. Morning program-

ming was planned to consist of
one-hour shows featuring top 40
singles, while the station’s pro-
gressive rock show, “Radio Free
Davidson,” would be moved to
the late evening 8 p.m. to 1 a.m.
time slot.

In September 1973, WDAV
went on the air for the first time
with a broadcast power of ten
watts, finally becoming a “real
radio station.” The station was
student operated and programmed
and featured rock, jazz, and clas-
sical music and news. :

In june 1976, students first re-
ceived their “DAV” in stereo FM
amid. talk of expanding the sta-
tion. This expansion became a re-
ality with the approval of the trus-
tees in February 1977.

Controversy arose, however,
about a condition, placed on that
expansion, that the station must
further alter its format to provide
primarily classical programming.
Furthermore, in order to receive

the additional funding necessary.

for the boost in output, the college
administration must be “assured
of maintaining overall control of
the station at all times.”

The board of directors of
WDAV, a committee composed

of students, faculty, and adminis-_

trators, released a statement of
purpose the following April. This
statement expressed an interest in.
having “a variety of programs in
keeping with the standards of

good taste and a college’s duty to
raise the cultural level of its com-
munity.”

“In the summer of 1977,
college hired Don Lovell as exec-
utive director of WDAV, the first
professional employee hired spe-
cifically to work with the station.
The following autumn, Lovell

proposed a programming

schedule which included ten hours.

of classical music a day.

The student staff responded to
this by initiating its own change to
a format of from 4 to 6 hours of
classical programming a day. In
their final approval of WDAV’s
upgrade to 18,000 watts at the end
of October, the Trustees included
the condition that, because of the
public relations impact of the sta-
tion, it would be a necessity that
WDAV’s “programming be
closely and continuously super-
vised by the college administra-
tion.”

In the spring of 1978, the
Board of Directors endorsed a
schedule providing for 50% of all
programmed music — not of
total airtime — to be classical.
Soon after programming began on
May Ist, Director of Communica-
tions Martha Roberts released a
Statement calling for a balance of
programming to match the diver-
sity of tastes and interests present
among the listening audience.

During the summer of 1978,
President Samuel R. Spencer de-

creed that 50% of all airtime had
to consist of lassical music. (The
difference between “programmed
music” and “total airtime” is the
time taken up by news and talk
shows — which, comprising
perhaps ten minutes per hour of a
nineteen hour broadcasting day,
would be equivalent to about a ten
per cent increase in total time de-
voted to classical music.)

All this led to much more con-
troversy, which came to a head as
a result of the Trustees’ decision
to take the station away from the
students and professionalize it.

Lex Alexander, a student
working with WDAV at the time
who later went on to work in radio
in Charlotte, commented, “I don’t
think I can overestimate for you
just how much that (angered the
students] . . . without the work
that had been done for free by the
students between 1973 and 1978

there would never have been a .

high-powered WDAV. For that
reason a lot of students felt that the
_ were ripping them
off .

Executive Director Don
Lovell offered his perspective of
the matter in the September 15,
1978 issue of The Davidsonian:
“It has always been the college’s
station... the thing Ithink that all
implies is that I think we are just
beginning to realize that this is big
. the station is a busi-
ness.”

In winter 1986, WDAV

‘moved from its home of long-
standing in the basement of the
Grey Student Union into the new
‘McMillan building, a move coin-
ciding with an application for an
increase in broadcasting power to
100,000 watts. This was the first
upgrade since the increase from
ten to 18,000 watts in 1978.

On May 5, 1987, Station
Manager John Clark commented
about the need to take “Flipsides,” .
WDAV'’s remaining alternative
music program, off the air: “the
long-term plans are to make
WDAV the best classical music
and arts station in the southeast.
“Flipsides” is not compatible with

. those challenging plans. As a for-

mat, it just does not fit.”

This short history of WDAV
shows that the perspectives of the
administration on the role of the
station in the community — and
of student activity at the station —

have changed a great deal since
its founding in 1969.

With John Griffith’s Sep-
tember 10th decision to cancel
“Flipsides” it was assured that stu-
dent participation in WDAV
would not die out — an interest-
ing hope in light of the fact that, as
Lex Alexander -commented, “in
the fall of 1978 WDAV was the
largest extracirricular activity on
campus except for IMAC and the
football team — it involved up-
wards of fifty people.” Today stu-.
dents involved number just seven-

teen people.

The staff recommendation for
cancellation: went to the Vice-
President for Institutional Ad-
vancement, Dr. John Griffith,
who in turn spent the summer try-
ing to determine what the program
was really like. He began listening
to the program, communicating
by mail with listeners who had
signed petitions in support of
“Flipsides,” and speaking to fac-
ulty members and “Flipsides” an-

nouncers.

Griffith finally made what he
called “a tough decision” and an-
nounced it at a meeting with the
two remaining announcers, Lee
Eichelberger and Frank Lord, last
Thursday.

At the heart of the controversy
over “Flipsides” lies a conflict of
opinion regarding student partici-
pation at WDAV. Both Clark and.
Griffith feel that the cancellation
of “Flipsides” will indirectly im-

prove students’ levels of partici-
pation as well as the merit of that
Participation in terms of future
employment opportunities.

With the cancellation of the
program, they explain, the station
will be able to make further strides
toward its long-term goal of be-
coming the finest classical station
in the southeast. Thus, students
who work for WDAV will be
supervised by classically trained
ted

springboard to radio employment.

Supporters of “Flipsides,”
however, claim that the death of
the program signals the end of all
“meaningful” participation by stu-
dents, who are now fettered by
formats, pre-written playlists, and
professionals.

In addition, they feel_hurt that
their petition, which had “around
1500 signatures” according to
Eichelberger, was not considered
by Griffith in making his final de-

cision.
According to senior Tom Gat-
tiker, supporters of “Flipsides”

.feel that the recent decision is

“just another example of the Trus-
tees’ disregard for the students’
interests.” .

Added Chuck Crews, “They
[the Trustees] don’t have the right
to [cancel] it. It makes me mad be-
cause the station used to belong to
the students. Now there’s nothing
else like it to listen to.”

Feeling creative?
Feeling brilliant?

Feeling hopelessly imprisoned by
the oppressive limitations of every-

day material existence?
