10—The Davidsonian— December 5, 1980

“Why aren’t Davidson women more
aggressive—are men that BORING?”

‘*All well and good, but let’s not
become female chauvinist pigs!”

In the next stall, some amusing
banality appears: (The following name

Clearly there is more to Davidson
graffiti than one might expect. Much of
it is lucid, contiguous, clever and
satirical. The bathroom walls have
become a community proving ground for
ideas and vented frustrations. They hold
the spontaneous opinions and desires in

contrast: one might conclude that they

are the most honest on campus simply
because they are anonymous.

Graffiti

But these selections merely touch
lightly upon the subject of graffiti at
Davidson, and there remain several
unanswered questions. For instance,
who really writes on the walls? Do
professors ever contribute? Do enough
contribute to accurately reflect student

opinion? Why don’t the girls write more?

Why does graffiti in the Union deal
mainly with drugs? Why is there

Chambers and only obscene graffiti on
first? Why is there so little graffiti in the
science buildings on campus? These are
questions for the ambitious sociologist,
or perhaps the next itinerant critic that
sits down in a library lav with pen in
hand—or firmly imbedded in cheek.

What can we know about the private
thoughts, opinions and frustrations of
our peers? Look to the handwriting on
the wall.

“If you don’t know I’m not going to

Salaries

(Continued from page 1)
Manning emphasized the im-
portance of salary considera-
tions to young professors. ‘‘Is it
worth it to teach an interesting
student here for less when one
can teach less interesting stu-
dents for more at Pembroke
State?”’

“We have two openings [in

the Religion Department] next

year which we're trying to fill,

and we’re expecting around 200
dossiers,’’ Polley said. ‘‘The
problems will begin when we
compete against other schools
who can offer more money.
While Davidson will draw some
because of its reputation, we’re
going to lose a good many of the
best candidates to institutions
that simply pay more.’

Vice President for Academic
Affairs Price Zimme:

assistant professor's salaries
have tended to lag behind those
of other professors because past
pay increases were frequently
awarded on a percentage basis.
“When you’re giving 10 percent
of $25,000, you’re obviously
giving more than when you give

“10 percent of $15,000,” he said.

“Although our aim was a 12.5
percent increase across the
board last year, the total figure
was actually higher given the
extra amount set aside for
assistant professors to prevent
this kind of statistical skew-
ing,’’ Zimmermann said, ‘‘In
dollar amounts our assistant
professor would otherwise get
less.”

Zimmermann pointed out Da-
vidson’s relatively favorable po-
sition for overall faculty com-
pensation but added that there

first half ended with Northwest-
ern ahead 2-0, but play improv-
ed in the second half as David-
son engineered a comeback. The
Cat defense shut off further
attempts on goal, while Carol
Heppner scored on the other
end, but time interrupted the
comeback as Davidson came up
a goal short.

After a slow 0-3 start early
this fall, the squad launched a
record breaking season in which
they captured the North Caro-
lina AIAW Division II Cham-
pionship, placed runner-up. in
the Regional Turnament, and
qualified for the National Tour-
nament as well. Advancing to
national competition was a first
in the five-year history of
Davidson field hockey, as was
winning the state AIAW title.

The 1980 season ended with
new team records in almost
every category: longest, winning
streak (11 games), longest un-
defeated streak (14 games),
most shut-outs (7), most goals

is a ‘“‘good case’’ for increased
salaries for assistant professors’
“It would seem that perhaps
assistant professors should re-
ceive special consideration next
year.”

In determining what salary
levels are fair, the College must
decide what other colleges it
should compare itself to. Chem-
istry Professor Ralph Gable,
President of the Davidson
AAUP chapter, said, ‘I think
when we compare ourselves in
terms of quality we like to think
of the semi-Ivies, but when we
start talking about salaries we
think about other North Caro-
lina schools.”

Zimmermann warned against
unfair comparisons with state
institutions. | ;

“I think the only comparison
should be with other liberal arts
institutions. I can’t see in this
age of massive state aid to
public schools how we can keep
up. I think the faculty under-
stands this.”

“Also, university salary fi-
gures are not comparable to
ours since they include the
schools of Law, Business, and
Medicine which traditionally
pay more,”’ Zimmermann said.
‘‘We used to be ahead of other
schools in the area but this is no
longer true given the impor-
tance of federal funds in the
budgets of public institutions.”

Manning felt Davidson has
no choice in competing with
large universities and state
institutions. ‘If we continue to
compare ourselves to small
liberal arts schools we do our-
selves a disservice. We must
attract the same faculty that

scored in a single game (10,
versus East Carolina on Oct.
11), most goals scored in one
season (49, including national
competition), and largest winn-
ing margin (10-0, against East
Carolina).

Senior Cathy Inabnet also
broke Davidson individual re-
cords, including most goals in
one game (5 versus East Caro-
lina) and most goals in one
season (18). She also set a
career scoring record with 37
during the period 1977-80.

Mayes praises Inabnet high-
ly. ‘‘Nabby always started the
forward thrust, her stick work
is excellent, .she’s fast, and her
shots are well-directed.”’

Amy Crittenburger was the

_ team’s defensive standout.

Mayes said, ‘‘Amy defensively
played a crucial position at
center half and helped everyone
else to fit in. I’d have to credit
Amy for the reason .why the
defense did so well.” .

Mayes complimented the en-

tire squad for its teamwork.
“Everyone did their job. They
all gave their best and each
improved as the season progres-
sed.’’

Coach Mayes carried 16 play-
ers, the largest hockey team
ever at Davidson. Three players
began the season with little or
no experience. The record of the
team speaks for the talent and
patience of Coach Mayes.

As the 1980 season ends,
four-year veterans Barb Ash-

ley, Lisa Ballentyne, Sally .

Craig, and Cathy Inabnet have
played in their last games. Each
contributed tremendous leader-
ship during their final season.

Field hockey began as a
Davidson varsity sport in 1976.
In only five seasons, former
Coach Susi Roberts and Coach
Dee Mayes have assembled the
most successful sports team at
Davidson in recent years.

The overall record stands at
46-20-6, with a .697 win percen-
tage, (.750 in 1980).

may be attracted to state
supported schools,” he said.

“We must also consider the
question of Davidson’s reputa-
tion. Students come here be-
cause of its reputation for
getting people in grad school,
etc., not for the faculty. Yet our
academic reputation eventually
depends on the faculty,’”’ Man-
ning said.

“In the marketplace we aren’t
competing with other liberal
arts colleges for students and
professors, but with all institu-
tions. We did a study three
years ago to find out where
people go who are accepted at
Davidson but choose to go
elsewhere. Ninety percent went
to schools which cost less, the
majority being state schools
which receive state and federal
funds. So I can’t see how we can
compare ourselves only to insti-
tutions which resemble us in
some way.”

Davidson is not alone in the
salary crunch by any means,
and assistant professors aren’t
the only onés who experience it.

The income of college and
university professors through-
out the United States has fallen
markedly in real terms over the
past decade. According to the
September issue of Academe,
for example, average nation-

wide salary increases of 7.1
percent in 1979 did not keep
pace with the inflation rate of
13.3 percent.

The continuing trend of infla-
tion may completely erode the
significant gains in salaries won
by professors in the 1960’s. And
though public institutions are
under strain, it is the small,
private colleges that face the
toughest financial squeeze.

Last spring the College is-
sued a five percent across the
board salary increase. Discre-
tionary increases awarded on an
individual basis boosted the
average to a 13 percent increase
for all professors.

The assistant professors’ 14.8
percent average increase topped
that of the full professors (11.7
percent) and associate profes-
sors (13.3 percent). Even with
this increase, faculty salaries at
Davidson have not kept pace
with inflation over the past
decade.

Gable called for increased
compensation for all professors.
‘We need to have some across
the board increase. The erosion
over the last few years has hurt
morale.”

“We're not out to get. rich but
on the other hand it’s discou-
raging to see we’re losing
ground each year.”’
