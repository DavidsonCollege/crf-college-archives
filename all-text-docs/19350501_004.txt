’CATS NOSED OUT
BY CAROLINA BUT
BEAT STATE

PORTS
TACCATO

By H. L. KUYKENDALL

Although there isn’t a student on our
campus who doesn’t know just whaf€om-
poses the Wildcat coaching staff, this
column will attempt to give in these
few remaining issues at least a little
more intimate view into the life of these
men... men who watch over and guide
the athletic prowess and spirit of Da-
vidson College.

NORTON G. PRITCHETT

Tho’ reluctant in talking about him-
self, Captain Pritchett narrated what he
modestly termed a few “uninteresting
facts.”

Born in Louisville, Kentucky,
Captain first entered his father’s
school in that same city, spending
around six years there, no doubt
building up the qualificati that
later enabled him to establish such
an enviable athletic record.

While in high school he served ‘as a
member of the football, basketball,
track and baseball teams, distinguishing
himself particularly in football and
track.

Entering the University of
Tennessee in 1911 he confined his
athletic activities mostly to foot-
ball and track although boxing
and wrestling occupied a good
part of his time. Captain also par-
ticipated actively while at the
University of Louisville, Harvard,
and Wisconsin, although the last
two named were not in varsity
competition since he attended
these for special work.

Georgia ‘Tech, Vanderbilt, Kentucky
State, and Alabama were the principal
opponents that Captain Pritchett met
during his career on the Vols’ football
machine.

Asked about the football played
then as compared with that of to-
day, Captain replied that it was
“pretty rough,” pointing out that
the principal difference lay in the
fact that the rules then, compelled
the offense to indicate to their
opponents whenever they were
going to pass. This indication was
made by extending the position of
the ends out a great deal more
than the now effective. rule of 3
feet from the tackle.

At’ the outbreak of the war, Pritchett
was immediately commissioned a _ cap-
tain, having had ten years of military
instruction in the various schools which
he attended.

While overseas he took active
engagement in the battle of the
Argonne, and St. Meheil finally
ending up at Stenay. After the
armistice, Captain Pritchett
worked overseas as Regimental
athletic director, afterwards re-
turning to this country and event-
ually to the job he now holds as
athletic director at Davidson.

Asked about his only having one lung
as the. result of war combat, Captain
Pritchett laughingly replied that it was
“all a pure myth.” Explaining that he
did spend a little time in a hospital as
a result of gas, although it did not
affect him as bad as rumors would have
it. It probably originated “when I
broke two ribs at camp several years
ago.”

PACK SEES RED

A big treat was put on last
Monday afternoon by members of
the ’cat ball club in the form of
a 4-2 victory over an almost de-
moralized State College nine. The
last inning proved such a “jonah”
to pitcher Bogg of State, that a

HARRIS WINS NET TITLE

Net Men To Meet Lenoir-Rhyne
And Charlotte Teams

The Davidson varsity tennis team lost
a match to the University of North Caro-
lina team last Wednesday, April 24, and
then entered the state tennis meet which
took place at Chapel Hill also. David-
son representatives reached the quarter-
tinals in the singles and the semi-finals
in the doubles.

The Carolina team defeated the Da-
vidson team by the score of 9-0. The
summary of the match is as follows:

Harris (C) defeated Lewis (D), 3-6,
6-3, 6-4; Willis (C) defeated Phifer
(D), 6-2, 7-5; Minor (C) defeated Bar-
nett (D), 8-6, 6-1; Shore (C) defeated
Elvery (D), 7-5, 6-9, 7-5; Levitan (C)
defeated Hornbeck (D), 6-0, 60; Abels
(C) defeated Morrow (D), 6-3, 4-6, 6-2.
In the doubles Abels and Harris (C)
defeated Elvery and Barnett (D), 6-4,
6-1; Levitan and Willis (C) defeated
Lewis and Phifer (D), 6-3, 3-6, 6-4;
Minor and Shore (C) defeated Horn-
beck and Garrett (D), 6-0, 6-0.

The last three days of last week the
first five men of the Davidson varsity
team entered the state meet. In the first
round of the singles play Harris (C) de-
feated Barnett (D), 6-0, 6-0; Hornbeck
(D) defeated Nading (N. C. State), 6-4,
6-2; ‘Phifer (D) defeated Martin
(Duke), 6-2, 1-6, 6-1; Lewis (D) de-
feated Lynch (C), 6-2, 7-5; Jones
(Elon) defeated Elvery (D), 6-3, 2-6,
6-0.

In the second round of play, there re-
mained three Davidson players. Their
results were: Harris (C) defeated
Hornbeck (D), 6-4, 6-4; Phifer (D), de-
feated Crabhill (Elon), 6-2, 3-6, 6-3;
Lewis (D) defeated Jones (Elon), 2-6,
6-1, 6-3.

In the third round or quarter-finals,
there remained two Davidson players.
Their results were: Minor (C) defeated
Lewis (D), 6:3, 6-1; Levitan (C) de-
feated Phifer (D), 7-5, 6-0.

Harris of Carolina and Minor of Car-
olina fought it out for the title in the
finals. Harris defeated’ Minor in a five-
set match in which Minor made a des-
perate bid for the title. Harris was
seeded number one and Lewis number
three.

There were two Davidson teams en-
tered in the doubles. These were Lewis
and Phifer and Hornbeck and Elvery.
The results of their matches are as fol-
lows: In the first round, Lewis and
Phifer, bye; Degray and Levitan (C),
who were seeded number one in the
doubles, defeated~Hornbeck> and~Elvery
(D), 6-2, 6-0. In the second round Lewis
and Phifere (D) defeated Taylor and
Martin (Duke), 7-5, 4-6, 9-7. In the
semi-finals, Levitan and Degray (C) de-
feated Lewis and Phifer (D), 6-1, 6-1,
6-2. -

The crowd was entertained and no
doubt gratified by a hot argument be-
tween “the ump” and Coach Doke of
State, all of which, many agreed, added
no little zest to the game.

To mention a few men on the
Wildcat nine would almost be un-
fair, so well did all perform, but
since space is limited this column
hands the laurels particularly to
Jim Dickson, Woody Burns, and

BIG FIVE TRAGK
MEET T0 BEGIN

Varsity And Frosh Enter State
Competition Next Saturday
. At Carolina

The varsity and frosh cindermen will
leave this coming Saturday morning for
Chapel Hill to enter state competition
in the annual state track meet. All mem-
bers of the “Big Five” will be repre-
sented, along with several small institu-
tions in thé state.

Earl Frazier, mile and two-mile record
holder for the state, will be in perfect
shape for the meet, as he expects to do
better than last year at the meet by
breaking his own record for the two-
mile. He has designated this race as
the feature event. His record for the
mile is 4:23 and for the two-mile 9:43.
His competition will be with Waldrop
of Carolina, as he also has distinguished
himself as an outstanding two-miler.

Davidson also has several promising
trackmen who have been showing up
very well in practice and in meets
throughout the season. Paul Pittman is
expected to do very good at the meet,
as he has been pole vaulting 12 feet
consistently this year. John Lee, who
has been out for several weeks on ac-
count of a sprained ankle, will be in
shape for the meet Saturday and is ex-
pected to make a deciding comeback
after his layout.

The frosh will, also probably come to
the front, as they have several men who
have been doing very well throughout
the season and are expected to take
places at’ Chapel Hill. Morris Freeman
will be on hand to enter in the shot put
and discus throw, while Barrow and
Wicker will fight out positions in the
hurdle entries. Parcell has been doing
very well in the one-mile and will enter,
for the first time, the two-mile, and
claims to be doing very well.

The meet will run off the qualifying
rounds in the morning and the main
events in the afternoon. Several Da-
vidson men are expected to carry off
state honors.

The'doubles finals were not played un-
til Monday afternoon and so the winners
will not be available when The David-
sonian goes to press. ‘

FAOSH DEFEAT
BELMONT NINE

Wingate And Boiling Springs
Trample Kittens By Lop-
Sided Scores

'Kittens 5, Boiling Springs 15

On April 23rd the freshmen lost an-
other ball game here to the tune of
twelve errors and fourteen hits. The
frosh were never in the lead and only
threatened once, with a three-run rally
in the third. Baker of the visiting nine
carried off batting honors with a single
and two doubles for four trips to the
batter’s box. Clark led the locals with
two hits in four attempts. Davidson col-
lected some nine hits, which they con-
verted into five runs.

Davidson 7, Belmont Abbey 4

On April 25th, the ’Kittens showed
good form and won from Belmont in
an easy manner. Clark pitching with
excellent support, allowed only seven
hits. The game was featured by the
home runs of Baskerville and Williams
for Davidson and Mauro, first-sacker for
the visitors. The ’Kittens turned in two
double plays and miscued only thrice.

Wingate 10, Davidson 0

On April 27th, Wingate unloaded their
big bats and blasted out an easy win
over the men of '35. The visitors slapped
out five homers off Kiesewetter. Tally
led the parade around the bases with two
round trip tickets. Wingate played heads-
up ball and the outcome was never in
doubt. The out-of-town boys picked up
twelve hits. Smith, the visiting pitcher,
allowed four well-scattered bingles.

Sophs Continue
Winning Streak

The sophomores, under the leadership
of Joe Hunter, defeated the freshmen,
18-13, to head the list in intramural base-
ball. ew

Captain Joe Hunter said’ that his team
was badly off the day of the game, mak-
ing a number of errors. The sopho-
mores had considerable praise for Vause,
freshman righthander, and said he was
the hardest pitcher to hit that they had
come up against this season.

This game makes the third consecutive
victory for the sophomores, having won
over the seniors, juniors, and the fresh-
men.

The game was tied until the fifth in-
ning when the sophomores made’ eight
runs. Neither team was able to get many
runs until the last half of the ainth
when the freshmen staged a desperate
comeback and scored: six runs. Willard
Dixon, frosh catcher, tapped the old rock
upon the roof of Georgia for the first
home run. Bill Bonderant retaliated
with a home run for the sophomores by
knocking the ball on the roof of the
gym. ‘The freshmen have been aided
by the playing of Rainey, Dixon, and
Faison, while the sophomores are helped
with the playing of Charles Elder, Joe
Hunter and Bill Bradford. M

The local Hi-Y gave a roller skating
party on the river road Saturday night,
April 27. Chaperones-were Don Bailey
and Mary Louise Moffett.

this scoring spree, Mackorell, Morgan,
Dixon, Ravenel and Porter accounted for
the ’Cat runs.
