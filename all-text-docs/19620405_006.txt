Objections Often Lodged
Against Mandatory ROTC

through the Synod of North Carolina,

BY BILL HAGEN
Davidsonian Managing Editor

The seed for the present ROTC
gram was innocuously planted in 1916 when
it was announced that military science
would be incorporated as a branch of Junior
Applied Mathematics course. This move was
to allow the more intelligent Davidson men

pro-

to be eligible to utilize his talents as a
leader if he enlisted. Academically, the
artillery training involved was hailed as

“a valuable asset.”

As the war approached, patriotism in-
tensified on the campus. THE DAVIDSON-
IAN began putting American flags in the
two top corners and running letters from
those who were fighting with the French

Davidson initiated compulsory military
training and the whole college plant was
soon put under the supervision of a com-
manding Officer., Students slept on newly
set-up cots in the three dorms and were
awakened each morning by bugle. Disci-
pline was extended to the faculty as well
as the students.

SATC INAUGURATED

In a “memorable ceremony” Student
Army Training Corps was inaugurated in
October 1918. Messages were read from
President Woodrow Wilson and the Sec-
retary of War. Wilson wrote, “the step
you have taken is a most significant one.”
An. editorial in the same issue lamented
the fact that grace was no longer being
said before mess. It questioned, “Shall we
Davidson students neglect this matter while
students in the regular army do not?”

By November of the same year the
front page was dominated by SATC activi-
ties. A bayonet course had been completed,
featuring dummies, barbed wire, and a
series of trenches to charge over. As an
added incentive, the last one contained
water.

Most important in this particular issue
though, was the announcement that the
student body had raised $7,179.50 for the
Red Cross’s United War Work Campaign,
the highest amount for all colleges, per
capita, in the United States.

DISCIPLINE GRIPES

An editorial bemoaned the uncertainty
of the fate of SATC, stating that if it were
discontinued the “college will stare ruin
in the face” since the added financial bur-
den would force the majority of the student
body to quit school. It exhorted the students
not to gripe about the discipline which ap-
parently went so far as to confine a man to
campus for as long as fifteen days.

Early 1919 saw the replacement of
SATC by ROTC. The news article on it
mentions the disappointment that was sure

to follow from those who were looking for
its abolishment or for a crip course.

“The Lame, The Halt, The Blind, Must
Make Up Drills” was the headline of a news
story later the same year. Extra drills were
initiated as often as they were needed for
students who missed regular drill

In April 1928 newspaper coverage of
military affairs surpassed the former war
time record in a special “Warfare Extra.”

A front page map showed the “terrible en-
counter between the Reds and the Blues.”
News stories told how the Blues gained
ground but were “Fearfully shot to pieces,
due to the incompetency of the officers and
their own rashness ’ “Major-General
Tufts” won particular recognition for fac-
ing a whole battalion of the Blue infantry
with only six men left. All escaped un-
scathed after being encircled.

The Davidsonian, 1917.

The "30s" was apparantly a time when
discontent with ROTC became more evi-
dent the subject received more editorial
treatment than at any time in the past.

OPTIONAL ROTC?

The editor saw fit to reply to the im-
plication by local papers that “Davidson
Collgee has been captured by the War
Dept.” in 1930. The year 1932 saw the
Trustees adopting a positive report made
by the Committee on ROTC liberalizing
only the number exempted to those with
previous training, conscientious objectors,
and pre-meds with crowded schedules.

A 1933 editorial commented on the
registration turmoil that resulted when a
Charlotte newspaper stated in a headline
that ROTC was being made optional. The
real story was that the Southern Presbyter-
ian Church recommended to the Trustees,

to
make the program optional.

gruity of a church-related school’s sponsor-

IAN criticised outsiders who ‘“‘don’t under-
stand military science.”

‘GHASTLY IRONY’

A short time later three
(R, M. Cann and Jack and W. F.
koontz) reacted to the editorial, questioning
the assertion that only “outsiders’’ were
against ROTC. “There is a ghastly irony in
this Davidson scene. At 10:15 a.m. we are
compelled to worship the God of Love and
Prince of Peace. At 3:05 p.m. we are com-
pelled, with rifles on our shoulders, to
study the art of mass-murder.”

The week after that the vice-president
of Cannon Mills Co. stated that those who
do not appreciate ROTC “would possibly do
well-to have the experience as they will
most likely be the first to need it...”

All this controversy apparently had
some effect for in February of 1934 the
Trustees abolished compulsory — military
training. The Charlotte Observer, Greens-
boro News, and THE DAVIDSONIAN all
hailed this move editorially. The school
paper stated confidently, though, that
would little effect the number taking ROTC

next year. As it turried out, 38 out of 200 |

entering freshmen did not sign up for it.

ROTC was re-emphasized as World War |
II approached, culminating with a special |

ROTC Issue of the paper in 1941.
RIFLES BIT TOO TALL

In November of the same year (1941)
the paper recorded the receipt of real rifles, |
of Russian design, for training. They were
conceeded to be “a bit too tall for the |
shortest men.”

During the war approximately 200
students were enrolled in a reserve unit
of the Air Corps here while awaiting
orders. Immediately after the war the
pro-con arguement on compulsory mili-
tary training was renewed.

The last important histo-ical even
in the colorful enic of the ROTC Depart

Lack of interest was the
pea of the editors of The

avidson College Magazine
(as it was called in 1916)
just as it does the contem-
porary one. In fact the pa-

r in that year expressed,
in a worried editorial, the
fear that the magazine
would disappear.

The suggested remedy was to
put the responsibility in the

hands <f the Junior Class. Be-.

sides giving the juniors a med-
ium of expressing their individ-
uality, it was felt that this utiliz-
ing of their dormant talents
would be good training for the
increased responsibilities that
would come to them as seniors.

An April 1916 editorial hailed
a move to revise the magazine

constitution adopted in Euman-
ean Society and at that time be-
ing voted on by Philanthropic.
The revision would reduce the
number of associate editors
from 12 to four. Instead of do-
ing all the literary work them-
selves as before, the new staff
would have complete control of
the magazine's policy and would
oversee the literary work.

The November 1925 issue of
The Davidson College Magazine
published a story, “Dim Morn-
ing” by Adrian Provost, which
was to have important conse-
quences. It was a rather medio-
cre treatment of how a self-
conscious young man is thwart-
ed in his love of a girl at a
house party. The story would
make little impression on mod-

issue next September.

However in the next DAVID-
SONIAN, a reviewer posed the
ultimate question about any
creative work when he asked,
“Is it the kind of article I would
send my mother to read?” He
further wondered if it reflected
the typical views held by young
people “much less the students
at Davidson College where all
except eight men claim to be
Christians?”

A crisis was brought about
when, in January, the student
body overwhelmingly elected as
the new editor of the magazine
Tom Barr, the real author of
“Dim Morning.” The faculty im-

parantly a high water-mark of
Davidson literary effort. In 1930,
Opinion was being expressed
that same year, though, in favor
of having a humorous magazine.
It reached a point where the
student body voted to create a
new magazine with two issues
consisting of all-humor and two
all-literary ones. An editor for
each division was selected.
75TH ANNIVERSARY
Later, in 1931, Ye Yow! was
created. By a student body vote
it was to be published three
times a year and tc oontain no-
thing but humor. This magazine
lasted until 1936 when the Exe-
cutive Committee forted its
cessation because of improper
opinions and stories in the first
two issues of the '35-'36 school
year. By a special student peti-
tion it was allowed to come out
two more times with the stipu-
lation that it be censored by
the English Department.

ies For Athletics

Follow After Losing Teams

BY DAVID PEARSALL
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Davidson athletics looked

promising in the fall of
1915. THE DAVIDSONIAN
claimed that Davidson had
entered “a new era in ath-
letics,’ that Davidson’s
coaching could “not be sur-
passed in the South,” and
that the “old-time Davidson
pep” was reviving.

The same year, the Alumni
Athletic Association began ask-
ing for donations from the
alumni to increase coaches’ sal-
aries. Aid to athletics was then
out of the question.

But the athletic revival pass-
ed, and Davidson found herself
in last place after the football
season of 1927. An editorial sug-
gested two alternatives: David.
son had to either stop playing
the larger schools or to some-
how attract outstanding ath-

; letes. The first was too disgrace-

ful and the second proved im-
possible without athletic sub-
sidies which would be stooping
too low. So Davidson continued
along the same disheartening
path.

In 1944 most of Davidson's
ethletes were fighting in the
war. There were only 200 stud-
ents from which to pick a foot
ball. team. Davidlson’s record
that year was embarrassing, but
some wanted to keep a team at

all costs. One editorial even sug-
gested playing high schools or
prep schools. “Any sport at any
time,” it read, “is more worth-
while and interesting when the
teams are evenly matched.”

By 1950, Davidson was losing
spectators, money, and pride by
playing football. An editorial
suggested that Davidson, with
eight other small southern col-
leges, could form a southern
“Ivy League” whose members
would agree not to subsidize ath-
letics.

After the conference was es-
tablished, the small colleges
would be more evenly matched
and their games would most
likely gain popularity. Davidson
could still compete in the South-
ern Conference in other sports
where she “had a fair chance of
winning.”

There was also the moral is-
sue against college professional-
ism to defend. If the crowd was
wrong, why did Davidson have
to stick with the crowd? “Let
Davidson lead the way and form
a new conference,” cried an
angry editorial.

In 1954, the editor of THE
DAVIDSONIAN was more sym-
pathetic toward athletic sub-

sidies. He argued that Davidson
athletes on scholarship were on
the whole as good students as
any other boys. And if the alum-
ni wanted to give their money
for an athlete's education, it was

their choice.

Later that year, Davidson took
a step to improve its athletics.
The trustees granted the col-
lege $35,000 for athletic sub-
sidies in 1955. Control of the
college athletic policy also pass-
ed from the hands of the ad-
ministration into those of the
trustees and the athletic depart-
ment.

However a DAVIDSONIAN
editorial denouncd@d the
trustees’ action, claiming that
$30,000 was a “puny bit” com-
pared to what other North Caro-
lina schools spent on football
and could not substantially im-
prove Davidson’s record. “If
Davidson is to jump on the
bandwagon of football,” it read,
“let her do it ina big way.”

Letters to the editor were

plentiful in 1960. One student
wrote “If we wish to call David-
son an educational institution,
shouldn't we spend a little more
money on. students who can
justify the name?” But others
argued that athletes at David
son were greatly responsible for
keeping it a well-rounded school
and not purely academic.

The question cf athletic sub
sidies remains. But whether
through subsidies or not, the
student’s prophesy in 1944 that
evenly matched contests were
the basis for successful athle
tics remains true. Even compe-
tition remains Davidson's goa!
