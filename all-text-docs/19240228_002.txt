JOHN RICHARDSON SCHENCK, ’22
Football D*
Basketball D
Coming Davidson from Clemson,
John Schenck showed his ability, both
on the gridiron and on the basketball
floor. In the fall of 1921 he filled the
positions of end and quarterback. The
quality of his playing is shown by the
fact that he won a berth on the all-state
eleven as right end for that year. Sim-
mons said of him: “As an offensive end
Schenck alone.” His work at
quarterback was also excellent. He act-
ed as captain of the team during the
period when Doc LaFar was out of com-
mission,
Out of the 165 points which the Wild-
cats scored in that season, to their op-

to

stood

ponents’ 153, Schenck was responsible
for 53. In the Elon game, he ran 70
yards after a recovered fumble, thus

making the longest run of any of the
Wildcats for that season.

He was a member of the Kappa Sigma
fraternity, and was president of the “D”
Club.

Johnnie, as he was familiarly known,
was a worthy team-mate of Doc LaFar,
Spratt Moore, Rooster McFadden, and
Gig Shepherd.

Mr. James Lee Sloan plans to build a
bungalow on the lot adjoining the home
of Mr. Roy Caldwell on Concord Street.
Mr. Sloan states that work on his new
home will begin within a short time.

Spring Football Gives
Aspirants Good Workout

Coach Tilson Keeps Large Squad at
Work During February and
March

As the spring weather grows balmier,
Coach Tilson is urging his soil-stained
warriors harder and harder in the spring
workout. The progressive coaching staff
is for the first time in the history of the
college holding a spring work-out to
drill the men in the fundamentals of
football and to develop new material. On
an average of from 45 to 50 men have
donned the pads and cleats each day.

For the past week, Jupiter Pluvius has
been pouring his liquid torrents from the
heavens and as a result the ground of
the freshman field where the practice
has been going on, has been too wet and
the practice has been temporarily shift-
ed to the cow pasture where Captain
George’s cohorts have their annual tugs
of war.

Coach Tilson had his tonsils carved
out on Friday and left the whole bur-
den for the time being on the shoulders
of Coach Younger who got back from
the basketball trip late that evening.
However, when they get together they
will develop some material of which
Davidson will be proud next fall.

A gqod many of the varsity linemen
are missing from spring practice on ac-
count of basketball, while others of
them are making names for themselves
by their work on the wrestling mats.

Spring candidates numbered more than
60. They are Herrticix, Hunt, Covington,
Wells, Baker, Summers, Sappenfield,
Potts, Lincoln, Buckner, Dick, Lewis,
Anderson, Briggs, McAulay, Green, Clark,
Legette, Williams, McConnell, Bohanon,
Varnadoe, Pinckney, Mitchell, Wharton,

SIMPSON AND GREEN
ASSISTANT CHEER LEADERS

Student Body Elects Two Assistants
“Out of Six Men Who Have
Helped Allison

Last week the Wildcats elected Simp-
son and Green the asistant cheer leaders
for the coming year. The difficulty in
this election was not in finding material
but in picking out the best men from the
very large number of fellows that proved
themselves worthy of being cheer lead-
ers. A, F. Simpson, S. F. Bryant, J. L.
Green, A. M. Martin, J. M. Carr and J.
A. Bouvier were nominated. These six
men together with the present cheer
leder, O. J. Allison, have worked hard
to keep up the Wildcat spirit. They have
thoroughly drilled the Freshmen in the
yells and showed them what real pep is.
Every freshman will testify to the high
quality of these men. They have been
right on the job. In the first election,
Simpson, Bryant and Green were left in
the running. In the final election, Simp-
son and Green were elected. There is
sure to be plenty of pep behind the team
next year, if these two men show as
much interest as they did this year. At
cvery pep meeting and at every game
they have been right there and have
showed what they are made of. The
student body could have made no bet-
ter selection and is counting strongly
on these two assistant cheer leaders.

A party composed of Miss Dorothy
Finlayson, Miss Ellen Black, Miss Orrie
Steele, and Mr. Vansant went to Char-
lotte last Tuesday night to hear Marti-
nelli,

Dr. J. P. Munroe, of Charlotte visited
friends in town Friday night.

For High Class

| The Dope Fiend

By W. F. Galloway

Hard luck on the Carolina trip Wild-
cats. Let’s drive for the state meet.

But the Wildcats Frocked Trinity on the

Mat

And those Tarheels just rattle right

along. Wake Forest and Trinity were

the latest to fall. The Methodists made
it a close game, however.

We back Carolina in the Southern
tourney. Kentucky and Mississippi A.
and M. are likely runners-up.

“Cristy” Matheson forgot to come up
today so we won't have much dope.

- The C. I. A. A. tourney is on in Macon.
This is the first year they have had a
separate tourney. Mercer and Chatta-
nooga, with Centre and Furman have
about the best records.

Only a few days now and the C. I. C.
meet will open up in Atlanta.

We notice that Chong McIlwaine has
taken over the job of our former scribe,
“Bailey Groom” Marshall. Chong ought
to keep the Queen City flowing with the
honey of eloquence for the rest of the
year.

Why not erect some stands on
athletic field? September is coming.

the

Suggested plans for using the columns
of Chambers:

1. Rollers for the athletic field.

2. Something to back up the Wildcat
line with.

3. Pile ’em up and. make an observa-
tory tower. It may be possible to get
high enough to see better days coming.

4. Knock 'em into suitable “dust con-
fetti and have a snowball fight with ’em.”

5. Let the R. O. T. C. shoot at them—
then use them for something else.

6. Lend them to St. Simeon Stylites.
He likes to live on them.

7. Just let ’em stand for old-time’s
saks. They really are cute, don’t you
think?

And in the meantime track and base-
ball have started out, which means that
all the major sports are at work at once.

That’s pretty hard on P. C. Henderson.
He has to run from one to the: other
all the time to keep up the “pep.” They
can’t get along without P. C.

And in the meantime the Princess is
waiting (yes, it’s a book, not a co-ed),
