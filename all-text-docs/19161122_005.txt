The Cadet—A_ great hickory tree
stands on the campus of the Virginia
Military Institute which is claimed to
have been standing when the college
was founded in 1839. ‘Clustered around
it therefore are the countless associa-
tions which have endeared it to the
hearts of many and gained for it the
title of the “Sacred Guard Tree.”

The Athenaeum—Next year may see
both Washington & Jefferson and the
University of Pittsburgh on the football
schedule of the University of West Vir-
ginia. Relations were broken on ac-
count of the attitude that those institu-
tions took toward the eligibility of ath-
letes who have played on teams consid-
ered preparatory schools in West Vir-
ginia but considered colleges by
Pennsylvania colleges because
teams play college schedules.

ARBOR DAY CELEBRATION
BY LOCAL SCHOOL

On Saturday of last week the local
celebration of Arbor Day, postponed
from the 18th of the month, was held
by the town school.

The exercises opened with the school
assembled on the front of the grounds.
Mr. Erwin led in prayer. The first
number rendered was ‘Arbor Day,”
sung by the entire school. “The remarks
that were the feature of the morning
were made by Professor Arbuckle, his
subject being “Trees.” His discussion
of this subject was very instructive and
interesting and greatly enjoyed. Fol-
lowing this the song ‘Joy to the Sturdy
Trees” was sung by the school.

Miss Withers’ class began the plant-
ing by setting out a splendid maple, aft-
er which they performed an attractive
arboral dance. Seven trees, including
several fine water oaks, were then plant-
ed, This brought the exercises to.a close.

Dr. Martin states that classes will
not he suspended December 8th, but will
go right up to the exmianations.

Salem High School will-play a game on .

team composed of scrubs and third team
men. Winston is a strong contender for

season. The game will be called at 3

exciting. It is hoped a large crowd will
be present to witness the conflict.

visiting team on the part of the David-
