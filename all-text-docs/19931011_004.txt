National
Coming Out
Day celebration

By Lexy DeVane

National Coming Out Week
begins today, October 11, nation-
wide. The purpose of the week is
to provide a positive atmosphere
for homosexual people to step out
of the closet and for others to ac-
cept homosexuality after realizing
some of their friends and family
are homosexuals. Members of
F.L.A.G. (Friends of Lesbians and
Gays) have planned several aware-
ness building events to recognize
this week.

F.L.A.G.’s chairperson David
Haslam hopes the week will help
“educate the student body on what
it is to be gay and educate anyone
questioning their sexuality in an
attempt to make the coming out
process easier.”

Haslam believes F.L.A.G.’s
role in its third charter year at
Davidson is largely educational.
As Chairperson, he hopes to con-
tinue to “break down the stereo-
types about gay persons and their
lifestyles and to make Davidson a
friendly sonny for people who
might be gay.”

F.L.A.G. has arranged for a
pictorial narrative to be displayed
in the Union Gallery. These pho-
tographs depict the Homosexual
Rights March on Washington last
Spring in which a Davidson
F.L.A.G. delegation participated.

Junior Anni Kirkland, amem-
ber of the delegation, said, “the
exhibit is a tribute and a profound
educational opportunity forusall.”

The Davidson Delegation in
’- Washington met several Davidson
alumni who proclaimed their ho-
mosexuality after graduation.
Haslam said, “One alumnus, upon
noticing the Davidson sign in the
march, spoke to the group. He
thanked us for our public support
and expressed his pridein thissym-
bolic gesture.”

The F.L.A.G. meeting this
Thursday at ten o’clock in the Wil-
son Room will be a special presen-
tation by Haslam on the issue of
Gaysinthe military. Haslam spent
this summer in Washington lobby-
ing this issue. F.L.A.G. meetings
are open to all.

F.L.A.G.’s presence on cam-
pus marks the first step in accept-
ing homosexuality. Haslam con-
cluded, “Davidson students have
the analytical and logical skills to
understand homosexuality, we are
just trying to give them the infor-
mation.”

tion Department Head Dr. Grace
Mitchell. He states that he had
considered teaching as a possible
career, but that he “wanted to make
sure what it was about” before
committing himself to a career in
education. So far, says David, the
experience has been positive.

Meredith Harris ’91 is in
charge of locating and researching
internships at the Office of Career
Services. Meredith notes thatmany
offices on campus have informa-
tion on internships.

She suggests that interested
students use some of the following
contacts: Ken Wood in the Office
for Experiential Programs, Jack
Perry or Laura Malenas atthe Dean
Rusk Program, Service Coordina-
tor Gigi Cooke, or the heads of
academic departments. In addi-
tion, Meredith highly recommends
consulting the internship guide-
books at Career Services.

ternships. The fields run the gamut
from arts to sports. Around half
are paid positions, and Meredith
notes that Career Services is striv-
ing to increase the number of paid
internships.

The guidebooks give the fol-
lowing reasons to get an intern-
ship: “to gain experience, to ex-
plore an interest, to build a base of
knowledge about the world of
work, or to decide [whether] you
want to do this type of work.”

Students interested in an in-
ternship may call the Office of

Career Services or stop by to visit
Meredith. She st ste

_ who are planning to| apply for an

internship and do not have a re-
sume should take time to write one
using Career Services’ Resume
Handbook. The book provides
guidelines which should help stu-
dents create a unique resume that
stands out.
