Davidson College, adhering to its ever-
present policy of providing comfort for the
students, is rapidly pushing to completion
plans for the installation of fur-lined chapel

has been noticed is the system of pneumatic
air cushions, one being placed in each of the
ditches of the campus, to keep the students
from hurting theirs on dark nights.
