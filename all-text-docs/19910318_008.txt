amounts.

All types of chocolate have
around 150 calories per ounce, but
darker chocolates contain more
caffeine than milk chocolate, ac-
cording to the percentage of choco-
late liquor. Still, you would have to
eat around one pound of milk
chocolate to get the caffeine effect
of one cup of coffee.

History: Chocolate has existed in
America for over 4000 years. In
Mexico before the discovery of the
“New World”, cocoa beans were
actually used as currency; tencould
buy you a rabbit. The Mexicans
drank chocolatl, cocoa mixed with
com and spices. The Aztec upper
class drank xocoatl, a bitter dyed-
red mixture of ground cacao beans
and chili peppers. They served this
potion to the Spaniards in the
1500’s, and the Spaniards were
unimpressed. However, on his
fourth voyage from the New World
in 1502, Columbus brought back
some cacao beans; thus, chocolate
reached Europe before either tea
or coffee.

butter, mixed it back in with the .

cocoa powder (the remaining part
of the bean), and added dried milk.

The first American chocolate
as we know it was produced near
Boston in 1765, and Baker’s
Chocolate got its start soon after-
wards. In 1847, chocolate was put
into a bar shape for the first time.

At the Chicago World’s Fair
of 1893, one display featured a38-
foot structure made entirely of
chocolate - 30,000 pounds of it.
That same year, Milton Hershey
began a candy company in Penn-
sylvania.
Finance: Two relatively recent
articles in Forbes and Fortune
reveal how well Hershey is doing;
Hershey’s is now a $2.2 billion
company which controls nearly
45% of the U.S. chocolate market.
Last year, Hershey’s expanded to
include Cadbury. Candy consump-
tion in America is rising, and,
currently, the price of the cacao
bean is down.

High prices and cachet don’t
guarantee the best-tasting
chocolate. Consumer Reportsrated

American), and Lindt (Swiss) were
among the best, at'a fraction of the
cost. Hershey’s Special Dark rated
low; Cailler Cremant was judged
the best of the dark chocolates.

Really good chocolate is made
insmall batches, without preserva-
tives.

Chocolate connoisseurs go for
a more “homemade” chocolate,
sold by smaller enterprises. Har-
bor Sweets of Salem, MA as well
as Green Mountain Chocolate Co.
of Waterbury, VT were mentioned,
as was Angelina (226 rue de Rivoli,
Paris) where a bar of chocolate is
actually melted into every cup of
hot chocolate served.

The Aztecs associated their co-
coa drink with divinity and power.
Their god Quetzalcoatl was said to
have brought chocolate down from
the Garden of Life to make Earth a
better place, and life easier to live.
My sentiments exactly.

I wonder how Consumer Re-
ports’ “sensory consultant” landed
that job, and if they’re going to
need another in the near future?

Carousels and People: Former
Davidson Professor Exhibits Art

By Bryan Bayles

Douglas Houchens’ paintings
arealive. Wisps of charcoal and oil
breathe across his canvases with
the grace of flight. And yet, as Bill
Giduz states in the February/March
issue of Lake Vue, these refine-
ments were born out of many hours
of contemplative and often dis-
couragingly difficult work.

Houchens disguises these long
hours of frustration by extracting

‘from them images which are, in the
true sense of the word, beautiful.
Fourteen of these images will be
on display at the Christa Faut
Gallery on Main Street until April
19th.

Houchen’s grew up in
Richmond, Virginia, and attended
the Richmond Professional Insti-
tute (now Virginia Commonwealth
University). In 1946, he joined the
Art Student’s League in New York
City. Seven years later, he became
Davidson College’s first full-time

art professor, retiring after a 25-
year career teaching students at
Davidson (Herb Jackson among
them). But, fortunately for us, he
continues to paint.

* Houchen’s previous show was
a retrospective in 1986 at Salem
College.

During the four-year interval
he has created a series of oil paint-
ings inspired by carnival .carou-
sels. In compositions like Central
Park Carousel with Mother and
Child and Carousel with Clay,
Central Park, a frenzy of brush-
strokes embody the crackling en-
ergy of the carnival, the dizzying
rotation of the horses, and the child-
like joy of the music. The swim of
colors is anchored by hints of the
vertical poles to which the horses
are attached.

In addition to his carousel
paintings, which form the bulk of
this show, Houchens has added
several portraits in various media.

Two portraits, Twin with Bustle,
and Other Twin with Bustle, hang
side by side. The thin lines of pencil
in the first composition give way
tocontrolled, melancholic smudges
in the latter, suggesting an aug-
menting air of relaxation and/or
fatigue.

Butitis in another pencil draw-
ing of three nude figures that
Houchens captures the spirit .of
sensuous beauty in its fullest form.
Appropriately entitled Versailles,
the drawing has passages that re-
call the graceful arcs of Watteau
and other rococo artists of the 18th
century.

Ata time when many contem-
porary artists are exploring the
depths of psychic struggle and
nuclear-age anxiety, Houchens'
work is an unexpected breath of
comfort.

And in Davidson’s pre-spring
break tension, the show is a much
needed source of inspiration...

grams. This week the spotlight
is on the Adult Literacy pro-
gram, Recycling, and Seigle

The Davidson, Adult Liter-
acy program matches Davidson
students with adults in the com-
munity who want to improve
their reading and writing skills.
We train tutors in the Laubach
method, a technique which has
proven to be over 90 percent
successful. After being certified,
tutors meetone ononewithadult
students for an hour every week.

In the past, some people have
chosen to work with children,
and this year, we have expanded
the program to include tutoring
inEnglishasa Second Language

people to tutor, but also we need
