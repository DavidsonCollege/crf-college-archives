VEREEN BELL MEMORIAL AWARD
AWAITS BEST CREATIVE WORK

The English Department has set March 1, 1950 as the
deadline for all entries for the Vereen M. Bell Memorial Award
for Creative Writing. This award, a prize of fifty dollars, will
go to the student of Davidson College who presents the hest piece

of original writing during the year. Vereen Bell was a student at

Development Drive

Enters Home Stretch’|«

With the beginning of a new
half-century, the Davidson De-
velopment organization of over
1,000 alumni, parents, and friends
is marching forward in a de-
termined effort to complete the
current $2,500,000 development pro-
gcam, 1949 saw a total of $2,150,-
613 secured for Davidson's build-
ing and endowment program. Cam-
paigr, leaders are extremely hope-
ful that the remaining $349,387 can
be raised during the weeks imme-
diately ahead.

Challenged by a recent study
which showed that several thou-
sand alumni and friends of the col-
lege have not yet been solicited,
Mr. J. Spencer Love and his top
committees have worked out care-
ful plans whereby all people not
yet seen, including both alumni and
parents, will be given a definite
opportunity to help in the final vic-
tory push, ~

During the month of December,
the. “Davidson Story’’ was pre-
sented to almost all of Florida. The
returns from that state, as well as
from Asheville, Wilmington, Co-
lumbia, and other centers in the
Carolinas, should do much to push
the total upward toward the goal
during the next few weeks.

Several important but scattered
regions have not yet joined in the
Parade of Progress. Largely be-
cause of date conflicts and sched-
ule difficulties, Davidsunians in
such cities as Florence, Sumter,

and Charleston in South Carolina,
Statesville in North Carolina, and

’ TaNahassee and Ocala in Florida,

have not yet taken part in David-
son’s forward march. Likewise,
there are large numbers of David-
son people in Washington, D. C.,
Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Vir-
ginia, West Virginia and several
other states who, as of January
Ist, had not participated. Finally,
there are hundreds of alumni whose
homes are just beyond the geo-
graphic limits of the campaigns
held during recent months.

In some cases, regional commit-
tees and special representatives will
be able to present the appeal per-
sonally to the remaining groups. In
many cases, however, these David-
son alumni, parents, and friends
must now “solicit themselves” and
mail their pledges directly to the
college. Program leaders have in-
dicated their concern regarding the
seriousness and speed with which
this “self-solicitation” is done, stat-
ing that this will determine
whether or not Davidson will be
able to carry through her program
of planned progress.

Library Gives Rules
For Overtime Books

At a meeting of the Library
Committee in Grey Memorial Li-
brary on January 17, 1950, the rule
was reaffirmed that faculty, mem-
bers only may keep books overtime
without incurring fines. All other
members of the college family are
subject to the same circulation
regulations as the student body;
that is, notices will be sent when
a book is overdue and fines are
to be paid when the book is re-
turned. Faculty members are sub-
ject to fines on seven-day books
(which are rarely essential to their
work) and are to return all books
when notice of the annual inven-
tory check-up is received.

Davidson and a graduate of 1932.
Just prior to his enlistment in the
Navy, he was recognized as one of
the South’s most outstanding writ-
s. “Swamp Water,” his first
novel, was a best seller and later
adopted into a movie. Both “Swamp
Water’? and “Two Of A Kind,’ his
second novel, were stories of out-
door life in his native Georgia.
Many of his short stories and ar-
ticles were published in weekly
magazines such as Collier’s, etc. In
1944, while serving as Air Combat
Intelligence Officer aboard the Car-
rier Gambier Bay, he was killed
in a surprise attack by the Japa-
nese in the Battle of the Philippine
Sea. .

The memorial award was estab-
lished in 1947 through the found-
ing of a fund by relatives and for-

mer college friends of the late au-

thor, Chiefly instrumental in bring-
ing about this fund to further the
creative writing of Davidson’s stu-
dents were his father, Chief Jus-
tice R. C. Bell of the Georgia Su-
preme Court, and Mr. Grier Mar-
tin, former alumni secretary of the
college and classmate of Rell. The
fund contains $2,000 of which fifty
dollars will be awarded to the most
original writer.

In 1948 .Charlces. T. Davis was
awarded the honor by Mr. Harry
L. Shaw, class of 1926, member of
Phi Beta Kappa and Omicron Del-
ta Kappa, former professor of Eng-
lish at New York University, and
now serving as an editor associat-
ed with Harper and Brothers.

Last year, Don Shriver’s “CN and
Saunders” won the award. It was
presented by Mr. Le Glette Blythe,
author of “Bold Galilean.”

The English Department urges
full cooperation and participation
in this Davidson memorial award
for Davidson students.

Student Conference [Davidson Printing Company
To Be Held At UNC |Occupies Adequate Offices

Saturday, Feb. 4th

A year ago this past Christmas
some twelve hundred = students
from nearly all the states met at
the University of Kansas for the
first nation-wide ecumenical student
conference sponsored by the United
Student Christian Council. At that
midwestern university, undergrad-
uate and graduate students ere
introduced for perhaps the first
time to the ecumenical reformation
which is seizing and energizing the
church.

The students from colleges in
North Carolina who met at the
University of Kansas have been
keenly aware of the growing value
of that ’ First Ecumenical Confer-
ence during the past year, and, as
a result, they have planned a simi-
lar conferctice for students in North
Carolina to be held on Saturday,
February 4, at Chapel Hill. This
will be the first such conference
to be held in the State.

The students at the conference
will represent a number of Protes-
tant denominations, and together
they will consider the theme, “The
World Mission of the Church.” In
complete disregard of denomina-
tional lines they will look at the
Church Universal, its weaknesses,
and its responsibilities to this
twentieth century world. Francis
Pickens Miiler, past chairman of
the World Student Christian Fed-
eration and recent candidate for
governor in Virginia, will address
the conference on the supject, “The
Task of the Church in the World
Today.” Later in the day, John
Deschner, executive secretary of
the United Christian Council and
an outstanding leader in the Ecu-
menical Movement among students,
will speak on the subject, “The
Responsibility of the Christian Stu-
dent.” In addition to these main
addresses, the schedule provides
for vocational discussions and for
denominational meetings.

Davidson will be represented at
the conference by Bill Harris, Bill
Adams, Joe Waller, Charles Elliott,
Milton Clenseur, Neil Leach, Watt
Jeffries and Curtis Harper.

semester, the registrar's office an-

nounced that eleven students cither:

Harviel, Donald H. Hawkins, H, E.
Hilliard, Jr, Ken Johnson, Sam
McDaniel, W. H. McEachern, III,

semester next year in order to grad-
uate. However, one or two hope to
graduate with the class of 1950.

HUNGARIAN BOY
HUNGRY FOR MAIL

On the West Chambers bulletin
board appears an interesting note
which might appeal to some. The
Y Secretary has received word
from a Hungarian boy of college
age asking if there would not be
an interested person in the college
who would begin a regular cor-
respondence with him. The eigh-
teen-year-eld lad is a member of
the Hungarian Reformed Church.
He reads and writes Hungarian,
French, German and English.

members of. the senior class, will
present a joint organ recital Sun-
day afternoon, February 5, at 4:30
o'clock in Chambers Auditorium.
Their program will include two of
Bach’s major otgan works, as well
as other compositions by romantic
and recent composers. The recital,
a presentation of the Davidson Col-
lege Department of Music, is open
to the public, and faculty, students
and .tembers of the college com-
munity are invited to attend.

Chartotte Chapter in the South-
eastern Regional contest of the
American Guild of Organistg held

son City, Tenn., attended Mercers-
burg Academy and Princeton Uni-
versity before coming to David-
son. His organ training was with

H. C. Broyles, owner and opera-
tor of the printing shop, is very
pleased with his. new quarters and
has stated that he may expand
sometime in the future by purchas-
ing more equipment. Due to the
shortage of store space in David-
son, Mr. Broyles had to use the
back part of the building in which
W. S. Henderson’s Jewelry Shop
is located when he opened his busi-
ness here. Now, however, ‘he has
an opening on Main street which
makes it much more convenient for

“Come, Saviour of the Heathen”

Mrs. Broyles is editor of the
first newspaper to be permanently

established in Davidson. The Ga-

zette has steadily grown since it
was established and is widely read
throughout north Mecklenburg
County.

Bad Weather Detains
Work on New Church

Plans are complete for the con-

struction of the new Davidson Col-
lege Church and the work is sched-
uled to begin in the very near fu-
ture. Weather conditions make the
announcement of a definite date im-
possible, however indications are
that the construction will begin
during the present month,
. The formal ground-breaking for
the long-anticipated campus church
was a highlight of the 1949 Home-
coming week end. Dr. Cunningham
conducted the ceremony, assisted by
Dr. James A. Jones and Mr. J.
Spencer Love.

Dr. Carl Pritchett, pastor of the
church, announced that the congre-
gation has voted to hold its weekly
services in the auditorium of the
Davidson High School while the
new building is under construction.

Recently Elected To
College Association

Dr. John R. Cunningham, presi-
dent of Davidson College, was
elected to the Board of Directors
of the Association of American Col-
leges at its recent meeting in Cin-
cinnati. He was also elected to serve
as Treasurer of the Association for
1950.

President Daniel L. March of
Boston University was elected
President of the Association. He is
a close personal friend of Dr. Cun-
ningham and serves with him on
the Board of Directors and Execu-
tive Committee of the Presbyterian
Ministers’ Fund in Philadelphia. Dr.
March gave the commencement ad-
dress at Davidson three years ago.
Davidson was represented by Dean
C. K. Brown at the Cincinnati meet-
ing at which Dr. March and Dr.
Cunningham were elected.

Dr. and Mrs. Cunningham have
spent the past month in Florida.
Recent engagements have included
a Davidson Day sermon at the First
Presbyterian Church of Ocala and
the launching of the Development
Drive in Tallahassee. Dr. Cunning-
ham returned to Davidson on Jan-
wary 31, and will be in his office
for a good proportion of the coming
weeks,

The versatile New Englander
came into prominence as a member
of the Artie Shaw orchestra, but.
long before that he had gained
more than a fair share of acclaim
in the entertainment business. His
initial effort came with the old
Commanders under the direction of
Irving Aaronson and there quickly
assignments with Joe
Venuti and Vincent Lopez.

Lopez was first to give Tony
a chance to sing, but it remained
for Artie Shaw to provide the really
big chance. The Bluebird record-
ing’ company listed “Indian -Love
Call” on Shaw’s waxing schedule.
Pastor’s vocal style seemed to fit
into the mood of the tune and so
Shaw handed his ace saxophone
and vocal star the arrangement.
While “Indian Love Call’ was in
its “hot” stage in the retail stores
it sold more than one million press-
ings. The catch, however, is that
an tnheralded arrangement of
“Begin the Beguine’ was put on
the other side. It’s no secret that
“Reguine” is the top popular seller
of all-time. .

Tony regards that as his biggest
single break. It gave. him the
chance to organize his own orches-
tra and after the usual trials and
tribulations, he was a top name
maestro with a tremendous world-
wide following. During his career
as a bandleader, Tony has been
under contract ‘to Bluebird, RCA
Victor, Cosmo and is currently a
leatcr in sales for - Columbia.
Though affiliated with Columbia
fot only a little more than two
years, the Pastor aggregation has
been responsible for five million
retail records sales.

Along with the fame and fortune
that marks the music jackpot, Tony
has endeared himself to the public
to a far greater degree than the
average personality. More than one
million milés of travel plus count-
less personal appearances have
brought him to nearly every town
and city in the land as a personal
introductian. The increasing sales
of: his Columbia releases and a
marked rise in appearance figures
clearly indicate that Pastor is now
at the very peak of his career,

Pastor is also one of the top
songwriters in the nation. To
his composing credit are some of
the best-known jump instrumentals
including “Wigwam Stomp,”
“Helen of Troy’ and “Jungle
Stomp.” Ballads which came from
the Pastor pen include “Blossoms,”
“For Whom the Bells Toll,”
“There's a Love Song in the Air”
and “Sunday in Savannah,” the lat-
ter three done in collaboration with
Hugh McKay. With drummer
Johnny Morris, Pastor developed
“Paradiddle Joe.”
