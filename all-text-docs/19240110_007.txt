WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT
YOUR POLICY?

Question: Is it possible for a prop-
erty owner to cancel his fire insurance

it?

ever, it must do so in accordance with
lines 93 to 100, which require the giv-
ing of 5 days’ notice and the return
of the unearned premium.

The Christian Endeavor Training Class
meeting was held in Shearer Hall Sun- |
day afternoon, with President Wallace
W. Purdy presiding. The usual program |
was changed. Each member was called
upon to give a short account of what he
had done while at home during the holi- |
days in the interest of the work. They |
also asked for an account of the work!
his home society is doing. Many said
they had given talks telling of the ad-
vantages received from the training class
at Davidson,
It was decided that a definite program

work for the balance of this year
should be mapped out, in order that the
class might have some set goal toward
which to strive. More men will be urged
to take parteand suggest new ideas.

At the last meeting before the holidays
Dr. HW. B. Arbuckle came before the
training class and asked that it take over
the operation of the local Endeavor soci-

of

cty and put it on a good working basis.
He thought some one should be in charge
who would give the members new in-
terest and a desire to render a more use-
ful work to the community in the future,
