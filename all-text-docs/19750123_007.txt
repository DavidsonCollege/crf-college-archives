Edwards Releases ‘Lucky Day’ Album

On March 22 and 23, 1974
Jonathan Edwards closed the
tour of his ‘‘The Let The Good
Times Roll Show’’ at the Per-
formance Center in Cambridge,
Massachusetts. The music of
that concert has been recently

released as an album entitled
“Lucky Day.” Jonathan Ed-
wards has been one of my
favorite artists for quite a
while, but all bias aside, this
album contains-an impressive
collection of good country
music. Perhaps ‘‘country”’ isn’t
the word I’m searching for, but
in this world of generalities it

‘ Cruising,

Long Meadows,
And

Green Pastures

By BOB ENRIGHT

So it’s Saturday night and .’ou ain’t got no money. You’re hungry,
yet can’t swing that trip to Slug’s Tower Suite. What to do?

You could throw your hands up in despair, or you could hit
Richards House. For the sake of your stomach, neither is recom-
mended.

Instead, why not borrow a few bucks and head up the Moorésville
road to Gerri’s. Kitchen. Formerly known as Deal’s Grill, its
proprietors junked that epithet in favor a of palatable description.

It’s also been remodeled and rio longer bears any resemblance to
a truck stop. One can always excuse the latter on the basis that you
can’t judge a book by its cover (a criterion which I have applied
many times in travels throughout the South), yet Gerri’s Kitchen
can be spared this acid test.

Except for what almost resembled an authentic pot-bellied stove

sitting in the corner, the main dining room is inconspicuous in
every sense. Those who sit at the tables surrounding the counter
are treated to the lyrics of Merle Haggard, Charlie Pride, et al,
from a purple juke-box, if they are so inclined to operate it.

The fare consists of good Southern home cooking, at reasonable
prices. Recommended are either the barbeque, country ham, or
fried chicken, all priced at $2.50 for a complete dinner. Everything
rated satisfactory except the iced tea, the quality of which has ap-
‘parently fallen victim to the sugar scandal. The service, too, is
quite good, and comes with a smile.

But, alas, you can’t please everybody. Joining us for the evening
were several reputable members of the Plantation, staked out on
ist Belk, all gourmets in fine standing. After condescending all the
way from pompano to pork barbeque in one week, their comments
could hardly be expected to be complimentary. ‘‘It was horrible,”’
one observed.

Another, after discovering that country ham did not come with
raisin sauce, opted for the southern fried chicken, which drew a
more favorable response. “It just sounded good,” our friend
remarked. ‘‘Anything that crunches that well has to be good,”
Finally assured that one actually does leave a tip in ‘“‘a place like
this,’ he left considerably better for the experience.

Afterwards, while cruising the Mooresville strip in search of a
little action, why not stop at Long Meadows for dessert. The milk
shakes, served with a spoon, area meal in themselves. (Only
problem is they don’t seem:to be open in the evening this time of
year.) , fet

will have to serve. However,
this review may help enlighten
you as to whether or not listen-
ing to his newest releases would
be worth your time.

Nine of the 14 songs on
the album have been recorded
on at least one of his three
previous albums. Since the
release of his first album in 1971
he has developed considerably
as an artist, as evidenced by the
superb quality of this album. On
this particular record he plays
the acoustic guitar, mouth
harp, and does the lead vocals.
At first, it disappointed me to
discover that he does not write
all his songs; yet he seems to be
able to take from the lyrics the
original intent of the author and
insert his feelings also. So,
although he may be singing
another’s words, it is his soul
that he pours into the songs.

The title song “Lucky Day”’
was written by Jonathan him-
self and I believe is a statement
of his life philosophy.

It’s bound to be my lucky day

I'm goin’? away. I'm goin’
away

Gonna find me a prece of land

And I'll work until I under-
stand :

That with love you could grow

a forest in the sand...
Pve said about all that I can
Words aren't any good no

more.

Let the spirit open up your
door

Let it show you what we: were
all put here for

It begins with an electric
guitar picking the melodic
theme, followed by the vocals
sung enthusiastically by
Jonathan. A banjo picks along
with the acoustic guitar backing
up the vocals; easy drums and
bass stay in the background.
The impressiveness of this song
lies in its vocal message so well
matched by the music; all the
instruments are there and
make their presence known but
without intruding.’’ Serving as
a base for the words to proceed
from, the instrumental sound
allows the vocal message to
ring out clearly. This is the
distinctive feature of Jonathan
Edwards’ finer songs; he
doesn’t waste ‘time with long

drawn-out feats of instrumental
endurance, rather he states
his feelings in a simple song
definitely attached to the
music; both certainly depen-
dent upon the other, but neither
detracting from the other.

‘‘Sometimes,’’ written by
Malcolm McKinney, is a love
song in a Class all by itself.
Jonathan’s voice is filled with
all the pain, hope, dreaming,
and love felt by the author.

Sometimes, in the morning
I catch a falling dream, disap-

pearing scene

I’m gonna keep the old back

forty for my home

You can go there but you
won't find my name

And my songs don’t belong on
Top 40 radio ss

He sings his songs with a real
concern for his audience,
hoping that they will un-
derstand that part of himself
which he lets loose on the stage
or in the studio. However, he
does not seek fame and instant
popularity which dies as soon as
it has begun. He seeks a lasting
relationship with his listener,
and values the good earth,

Rock

And I think about someone

That I will never see again

And now it’s only me again

And sometimes, in the mor-
ning

Well, I go back to sleep

Tryin’ hard to keep all my
memories in motion

I'm wishing she were near

My love

A soft acoustic guitar plays
the melody, then the vocals en-
ter; and with the words ‘‘disap-
pearing scene’ Stuart
Schulman’s crying violin and
Bill Elliot’s wistful piano begin
to play and underlie the remain-
der of the song. Bill Keith’s
pedal steel and-slow chords on
guitar accentuate the vocals
also. These five instruments
combine to produce an un-
believably beautiful sound fit-
ting right in with the mood of
this sad, aching song of love.
Appropriately, the violin is the
outstanding instrument, its
smooth lonesome solos taking
the theme one step further than
the words.

““My Home Ain’t In the Hall of
Fame:”’ written by Joe Dolce,
tells the story of performers
like Jonathan.

nature’s joyful abundance, and
a woman’s love far more than
flashing spotlights. This theme
is carried on in his song ‘‘That’s
What Our Life Is.’’

They say I would shine.like
the light in the city

I hoped it would be like the
moon in the sea...

Well I come on and let my
soul out for an hour

I play a few songs and go
home with a flower

But I don’t let it change all the
things I believe in

Like love and it’s music

And I wish I wasn’t leavin’

The song is combination of his
acoustic guitar setting the
rhythm with the help of strong
bass, a well-done piano, and the
pedal steel’s presence unifying
one line with the next and reply-
ing to the vocal statements.
Jonathan sings with special
emphasis on the line about
“them”’ promising him fame in
the city; he is always out to ex-
pose the foolishness of people
attempting to force their
peculair lifestyle upon others.
The song ends simply on the line
“that’s the way our life is.”’

Jonathan Edwards’ life has
been a difficult one, especially
during childhood as reflected by
the words in ‘‘Sunshine’’ about
military school. “Some man
gone and tried to run my life, he
don’t know what he’s asking. He
can’t even run his own life,
damned if he’ll run mine.” He
carries this thought further into
the political realm of our coun-
try in with the words “‘he said in
love and war all is fair, but
Nixon’s got cards he ain’t
showin’.’’ Once again we see the
importance of the individual.

When he sing his message to
whoever happens to be listening
he does so outside the glare of
the spotlight; his audience
comes to him quietly and freely.
“Give Us a Song’’ written by
Jonathan himself is a com-
bination of all that his life has
been and will be. As you read
the words, feel the warmth of
this man as he relates what is
most meaningful for him.

Give us a song to sing sweet
Jesus

Tell us the words you hear
that may be kind

And make it as long as the
day’s work before us

And tell me the tune to teach
the people just in time
