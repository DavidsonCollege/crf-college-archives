Don’t Make It Home-Going

THE DAVIDS

by Hill

DEAR EDITOR:

Recently I was shocked by
a rumor which seemed to be
circulating recently around the
campus. The gist of the rumor
was that a student had been
charged with having a bottle
of liquor in his car while ‘still
on campus. The bottle, accord-
ing to the rumor, had been left
in the car by accident by an-
other student.

Both students were convicted
and suspended.

Even if the rumor were never
confirmed, the fact remains
that under the present ruling
such a thing could happen.

But what upsets me even
more is the fact that, had the
student given a ride to another
person other than a Honor
Court member his situation
would have been completely
different today. We have a
double standard here that makes
“luck” a prime factor in our
system of self-government.

We, the members of the stud-
ent body, have passed the re-
sponsibility of supporting our
own constitution on to others.
‘The use of the phrases “honor-
bound” in relation to the meni-
bers of the Honor Court and
Student Council, and ‘“duty-
bound” in relation to the mem-
bers of the student body show
visibly the duplicity of our posi.
tion concerning this matter.

We cannot delegate just en-
orcement of our own rules of
self-government. Therefore, 1
now call upoa the Student Coun-
cil not only to expedite the
proceedings of the newly ap-
pointed committee considering
the wording of the liquor ban,
but also to appoint a committee
to prepare and schedule a re-
ferendum, the outcome of which
will democratically decide the
student body’s desire to keep
or amend Article VIII, Section
2, of the Student Body Con-
stitution.

If any member of the Board

‘ of Trustees becomes upset be-
cause this seems to be a move
to remove the liquor ban, I
need only to refer him to the
Davidson Collge (Faculty) Re-
gulations, the Student Conduct
Section, Point Four, which
states the same rule in an even
more encompassing way.

Th only units of enforce-
ment which the college stands
to lose are the Student Council
and the Honor Court, a combin-
ed membership of 27. On the
other hand, if the majority
rules to keep Afrticle Vin,
Section 2, and majority rule
is accepted, and, above all,
honor returns to our student
body, the college stands to gain
up to 973 new units of enforce-
ment.

It’s time to ammend or re-
instate our consitution; and,
by that act, to pull ourselves
out of our apathy and actual
dishonesty. Whatever the out-
come of such a referendum,
we would be stating our desire,
on both the student body and
personal levels, to foster in-
tegrity in daily living.

aptly describes the entire com-

While journalistic freedom
in a college publication may
have its place when tempered
by a degree of restraint, this
atumnus cannot refrain from
expressing sincere disappoint-
ment that Dr. Patterson would
chose THE DAVIDSONIAN as
his forum to air such purely
partisan political vagary under
the guise of supposedly sound

economics.

Without hampering the free
flow of logical ideas. more re-
sponsible reserve than is here
evidenced by the professor
would certainly seem to be in
order, particularly when one
considers that some degree of
proficiency in his field is prob-
ably imputed by the vast major-
ity of your regular readers.

EDITOR'S NOTE:

The article in question ap-
peared op this page two
weeks ago. Content of artl-
cles on this pege—designed
as a forum of opinion—are
essentially editorial in na-
ture. THE DAVIDSONIAN
does not and cannot expect
editorial features to be ob-
jective; rather we hope mat-
terial of this sort will serve

ly Professor Patterson's arti-

DEAR EDITOR:

It is interesting that Mr.
Ramberg chose to use the fact
that some racists are support-
ing the candidacy of Barry
Goldwater as a point to argue
that. the Senator's possible vic-
tory would be a “Threat to
Freedom.” Perhaps it is as
much of a threat to freedom
as was the candidacy of each
Democratic nominec  through-
out this century, since each
one had the all-out, die-hard
support of the Ku Klux Klan.
Or perhaps the author of last
week’s column would like to
suggest that those street riot-
ers are going to be voting for
Goldwater instead of Johnson.

Goldwater “spent the sum-
mer talking about violence in
the street’ because, from the
time of his nomination, viol-
ence in the streets proved to
be the summer's most flagrant
and dramatic problem. He also
reaffirmed his commitment to
protecting all the rights of all
the citizens, which necessarily
involves, as the Constitution
states, maintaining domestic
tranquility.

Furthermore, there have
been no recurrent, massive out-
breaks of violence in the South
in reaction to the Civil Rights
Act. Instead leaders on both
sides have remarked how re-
latively smooth the South's ad-
justment has been.

There are two additional as-
pects of the column which are
difficult: to understand. The
first is the manner in which
Mr. Ramberg begins: by pres-
enting two Civil Rights-support-

ing statements fone by the
Senator himself and one from
the Republican Platform) to
which Goldwater jis bound.
Then only a few sentences
later he says that “In this area
(“human rights”) the record
seems clear, if only because it
is based on his deeds and not
on his words.”

What, then, was the purpose
of the quotations? It seems
that both his words and his
deeds which the author goes
on to cite only corroborate his

belief in equal rights.

Mr. Ramberg then takes
these deeds of Senator Gold-
water and tosses them down
the drain, erases them from his
mind, because Goldwater vot-
ed against the Civil Rights Bill,
his negative vole means that
he was faking all along, that
his declared belief in freedom
has been just “a hollow sham,”
Says Mr. Ramberg.

In “My case of the Republican
Party, 1964" in this week's Sat-
urday Review, Senator Gold-
water writes: “The question,
under our system of govern-
ment, is not simply what deci-
sion is right but (italics Gold-
water's) who hes the right to
decide. Only when the latter
question is answered should the
former be considered.” This
is because of our divided
government of checks and bal-
ances and our constitution; if
we had neither we could give
complete control of the land
to one man and let him take
us wherever his whims might
lead.

Perhaps Mr. Ramberg could
more easily debate this point
in relation to the Civil Rights
bil; he will certainly have to
do more than he has done in or-
der to make his readers deny
and forget the work which Bar-
ry Goldwater has done for
civil rights.

Ore last thing: the colum-
nist predicted Goldwater's re-
ply to Negro pleas: “My hands
are tied.” Goldwater has re-
iterated again and again that
if elected he will uphold jus-
tice for all, and discrimination
against none.

No President agrees with all
the laws of the land, but it-
is the responsibility of each
President to see that every one
of them is- enforced with equal
dispassion, regardless of which
ones he may have voted for or
against. This Barry Goldwater
has promised us.

DEAR EDITOR:

I read with interest this
week the YMCA booklet which
I found in my room. Of partic-
ular interest to me was the
Great Issues program, which
appears to be under the guid-
ing hand of one Fred Sackett
House dinner fame. Well, I read
— the same of recent White
the Great Issues section through
several times, to make sure I
didn’t miss anything, and some-
how still didn’t find the ans-
wer to one seemingly obvious
question; namely, what is this
semester’s Great Issues?

I had somehow been led to
delieve that it would have
something to do with the great

dialogue confronting our nativn
between the philosophies of the
leaders of our political parties,
Johnson and Goldwater. But
looking down the list of. sched-
uled speakers, I fall to see why
al] of them, with one exception,
would not be happy to clasp
hands and skip gaily into LBJ's
“Great Society’ — or Brave
New World.

Robert Triffin of Yale did
not seem particuiarly relevant
to me Gn fact. the whole pro-
gram seems. to suffer from a
monumental lack of coherence.
If there's an overall! plan be-
hind it all, it defies these mere
mortal eyes to see it), but I
certainly gathered that he was
neither a conservative nor a
Goldwater supporter.

Two speakers from our own
little college are scheduled —
Drs. Patterson and Secor. 1 may
be wrong, but I do not con-
sider either of these to be
“Thunderers on the Right.”
Admittedly, there are not many
conservatives on the faculty,
but I wonder if Mr. Sackett
bothered to ask — say, Dr.
Chalmers Davidson or Dr. J.
G. Martin if they would like
to say a few words before sen
tence was passed?

Dr. Shulman is from Harvard.
Enough said. And Harry Gold-
en, despite a certain similar-
ity in name, has shown a rather
marked lack of fellowship for
Senator Goldwater.

So much for the so-called
non-political speakers. Turning
now to the avowedly political
spokesmen, we find Democratit
Senator Jennings RandoJph,
sponsor of Johnson's anti. pov-
erty bill; Mr. Henry Wilson,
Johnson's Congressional Liai-
son Officer; Col. Francis Miller
of the State Department; and
last and if not least, certainly
lonely, our own Representative
Jonas. I have severe. doubts
whether any of the first three
will have too many kinds words
for the Republean party or its
candidates.

So, adding up, we find cight
speakers for Johnson's “take
from the haves and give to the
have nots” and one speaker for
Goldwater's. “set the tides run-
ning again in the cause of free-
dow.” Now T'll match my apathy
against anybody's, but this did
sort of arouse. my curiosity.
Maybe some other students and
faculty would be interest-
ed in hearing how this fits in
with the supposedly Christian
concept of fair play.

Library Found Inadequate For Research

President, 1963-64 Freshman Council

The question arises, why does
Davidson rate so low in all
these areas when it has the

extra given to the library last
year for books. It was the
faculty’s responsbility to make
out a list of the books that
their department needed and
the library would see what. it
could go. Some of the faculty
were lax in this due to the lack
of time, but those that did find
the time found that for the
most part they obtained the
books they needed and asked
for. Some thought that it

permission some of this group's
findings are published here.

Also interested in this pro-
blem. last year's freshman coun-
cil sought interviews with heads
of many of the departments
and their faculty members in
order to get a cross-section
of views on the library. Their
summary is also present here.

LIBRARY EXPENDITURES

The Grey Memorial Library
has at present 100,000 volumes
with storage space for 175,000
volumes. In the periodical sec-
tion there are a little over
500 different publications. The
fibrary is staffed by nine per-
sons, five professional and four
non-professional, and is allow
ed a budget approximately
$95,000 a year (or an_ allot-
ment of $95.00 per student).
This sum does not-include sums
of varying proportions such as
the very sizable $40,000 approv-
ed last year by President Mar-
tin.

In the past five years the
amount of money given. to the
purchase of bound books has
increased from $20,025 to $29,-
645 (an inerease of $9,518). In
the same time the number of
volumes has increased at a rate
of approximately $5,245 in 1963-
64 (or an increase of $1,842).
Comparing these figures with
those of libraries of 28 colleges

highest endowment of any lib.

Is. the library adequafe to the

necds of the students and facul-
ty of Davidson?
“IS LIBRARY ADEQUATE?”

Of those departments asked
this question, % of them ans-
wered that the library was ade-
quate to their needs, % said
that it wasn't and the remain.
% were quoted as thinking it
fairly able to fullfill their
needs. It is interesting to note
that among those who thought
the library to be sufficient were
such departinents as Spanish,
Drama, Fine Arts, and Math —
not traditionally research sub-
jects.

A certain amount of money
is given each department every
year for the purchase of books.
The amounts vary from depart:
ment to department according
to three factors: 1.) Number of
students per department; 2.)
Average costs of books per de-
partment; 3.) Circulation per
department.

Responding to the question,
“Is the amount of money allot-
ed to your department for the
selection of books sufficient,
only one department answered
yes. The rest replied that they
found the money directed to
their departments not nearly
sufficient. Around 75%
departments interviewed stated
that they had spent over the
amount given them.

We spoke priorly of $40,000

Richardson Scholar Raps
Superticiality In Education

By MICHAEL LIGHT
1964 Richardson Scholar, Great Britain

The meaning and values of education are frequently

misconstrued.

The objeét of the educator
must be to inspire in his stud-
ents the desire to learn. Many
a teacher criticizes his pupils
for their purely competitive
and mercenary approach to
study. Yet so often this is the
fault of the sysfem, sometimes
even the readers, rather than
the students.

Until ‘one will study when
he is not compelled to do so.
he has learnt little. There are
enough of such people in col-
lege.

One reason is that compul-
sory class attendance tends to
build up an immediate inner
rebellion against. work. The
realization that missing one
class might mean missing some
information crucial fo forth-
coming reviews is quite ap-
palling, and can hardly in-
spire a genuine interest in the
subject. Again, regular tests
and reviews tend to destroy
one’s interest in one’s work,
simply because, owing to their
regulanity, one’s study must
be directed almost exclusively
toward them.

Similarly, during the first
two years of college, the wide
range of subjects studied, and
the lack of depth that persists
in most courses does make for
a somewhat dilettante educa-
tion.

If indeed a part of one's
college education should be re-
served for a wide range of
courses, then they should not
de conducted under such a com-
petitive system. Far better
that one year should be spent
in a good form of education.
Studying courses of one’s own
choice, away from one's “major-

ing” interests, in a greater
degree of depth, and without
the unnecessary competition.
During this time one would
achieve much of an_ interest
and a desire to learn, as- well
as appreciating the means and
methods of advanced study.
These two invaluable lessons
would in ‘the enstiing two vears
be applied to. one's major.
courses.

If it was felt that the first
years of college would thus
be wasted, such pedple should
not attend college. Tolstoy
wrote that “Principles of edu-
cation must be based on ideals
which are much higher morally
than our present life. Only then
may we hope that youth will
be worthy of its generation.”

It seems in this country that
the preoccupation of the people
with higher education has tend-

ed to obscure the great values
and possibilities of advanced
study.
EDITOR’S NOTE:

THE DAVIDSONIAN hes
been running articles by this
year’s Richardson Scholars.
We feel that their contribu-
tions to the campus news-
papers give them a chance
te communicate their thoughts
and ideas to far more of the
student body then they could
otherwise reach. The Richard-
son Scholars are invited, one
at a time, to write on a sub-
just of their own choosing for
THE DAVIDSONIAN. .By the
close of thelr visit at the end
of next semester, we hope to

have had several articles by
each of our 164-65 Richard-
son Scholars. ‘

should be the job of the library
staff to do the selecting and
ordering.

We have a good library staff
now which is working to capa-
city already. The present staff
can handle, order and catalogue
around 6,500 books a year. One
faculty member suggested that
there be added to the present
professional staff one or two
more. members ‘to handle the
selecting of books, for many
of the faculty cannot find time
to do so.

CURRENT NEEDS

The Grey Memorial Library
needs things — more money
sums them all up. Its periodi-
¢al section is extremely weak,
and duplicate copies of many
books cannot be found. The re.
search room is entirely lacking,

rary. Perhaps if the college
would seek capital funds for
an endowment of a sizable
sum of a million or two dollars
for. books alone, the needs of
the library could be met.

There is also the opinion that
the library is a good one, far
betier than usually described.
There is much culling of the
books and many that seem
more or less worthless to the .
needs of the student are thrown
away. Books are selected very
carefully, Dr. Davidson. head
of the library, says “If you
rate Davidson -by a quantity
check, it will come out lacking,
but if you rate it with a quali- .
ty check. it will come out in
flying colors.”

For those who have need of
research books, Davidson. is a ..
member of the inter-library
lending organizatior. All one
has to do is tell the librarian
of his needs and in a few weeks
the books will be in his hands.

If Davidson College continues
to predominately emphasize
note-taking classes with ryst
much individual research, thé
library is adequate to its needs.
But as a Research Library in
itself, it is entirely lacking.

The Grey Memorial library
has been making many strides
in the vast few years. There
have been books added, a rare
book room started, and other
new and heipful improvements.
But there is very much to be
done yet to bring the library
up to the par that the tradition

of Davidson demands.

Smith Rare Book Room
Receives New Editions

Dr. Harold M. Marvin of New Haven, Conn., a
specialist in the field of heart disease, has given to the
Davidson College Grey Memorial Library more than 300
handsome limited press books, many from the Golden

Cockerel Press.

Dr. Marvin was graduated
from Davidson College in 1914.

This latest gift to the library
at Davidson will be placed in the
Smith Rare Book Room, dedi-
cated this past May. Between
10 a.m. and 12 noon tomorrow,
the cases in the Smith Rare
Book Room will be open with
an attendant on duty, so that
returning alumni and other
visitors may visit the room.

The Smith Rare Book Room
honors the memory of four
Smith brothers, prominent min-
isters and educators, all alumni
of Davidson, whose home orign-
nally was in Greensboro; De.

Henry Louis Smith, president
of Davidson for 25 years, then
president of Washington and
Lee University; Dr. Egbert Wat-
son Smith, minister and secre-
tary of the Executive Commit-
tee of Foreign Missions of the
Presbyterian Church, U. S.; Dr.
C. Alphonso Smith, professor at
U. S. Naval Academy and at
the University of Virginia; and
Dr. Hay Watson Smith, who
held a long, noted pastorate at
Little Rock, Ark.

The room, located on the sec-
ond floor of the Grey Library,
was donated by C. Alphonso
Smith of Alexandria, Va., son
of Dr. C. Alphonso Smith.
