YO’ MOMMA’S DAY

Dour Eric Sappy...

Although it goes against usual practice, The
Davidphonian has decided to allow Eric

Sappy to finally put his extreme intelligence
to good use by answering questions from all

those stupid fucks out there...

Dear Eric Sappy,

I read your article last week
and I was wondering what crimes
members of the Davidsonian staff
had committed. I always knew that
they were a crazy bunch of kids, but
I never knew they were felons!!

Sincerely,
Kristen Richardson

Dear Kristen,

Well, Kristen, they have com-
mitted many crimes — of the heart
and of the soul. Despite their hard
work up to forty hours a week to put
out the best damn paper in the whole
fucking south, they have given us
only articles filled with untruth. Did
you know that Buster Burk is not
really the president of the SGA? I
am. And that playground thing —
yeah, right. What a stupid idea!
Who could ever come up with that?
Only the agenda-setting editors of
The Davidsonian. And the Faculty
Executive Council did not deny the:
Veterans Day proposals! Wecan all
take that day off next year and have
a sit-in. And the FLAG forum did
not have to be rescheduled, it really
happened when it was originally
supposed to be. I was there throw-
ing eggs. And that Masters Series
— what a crock! Like Davidson
could ever get famous people like
that to play here.

Dear Eric Sappy,

I read your article last week,
and I have a question. If the editors
of the Davidsonian deliberately left
the crime report out of the newspa-
per because of heinous crimes that
they themselves committed in the
month of September, then what is
the “month in crime” box on page 5
of the September 30, 1996 edition?

Love,
Buster Burk

Dear Buster,
You shouldn’t be asking. We

know that you were the “unknown °

male” who “exposed his genitals”
to the poor, helpless victims at
Lingle Manor on 9/2/96. I’ve seen
you in that Maroon Grand Am. Put
your pants on.

Dear Eric Sappy,

In your article last week you
said that “the practice of not re-
sponding to an opinion in the same
edition which it is published” is

“established journalistic practice.”
If itis, then why do I sometimes see
editors respond in The New York

Times, Washington Post,
Newsweek, Libertas, and Time?
Regards,

Tom “buy it, it’s cheaper”
Wicker

Dear Tom,
It’s all liberal trash.

Dear Eric Sappy,

Why did you put a [sic] ([sic])
by “bald assertion” when quoting
the editors of The Davidsonian?
“Bald” may be used as an adjective,
as in “bald-faced lie.”

Much love,
Elizabeth Mills

Dear Elizabeth,

I would prefer it if they used
“bald” to refer to a person with no
hair. “Bald” should be used as an
adjective to describe this condition,
as in “Dr. Kuykendall is half bald.”

Dear Eric Sappy,

Regarding your article last
week, please elaborate on your per-
ception of the word “biased.”

Cheers,
John Heil

’ Dear Dr. Hile,

I am surprised, and honored,
that you are asking me. The word
“biased” is an adjective meaning
“not agreeing with the correct view.”
In most cases, the correct view is
one based on good morals and good,
clean, heterosexual fun. Just look
at the article on the front page of the
April 7, 1997 Davidsonian. There
are many quotes from Friends of
Lesbians and Gays members say-
ing that they did not want the chap-
ter to fold. Because the newspaper
published this article, gay people
are now “coming out.” That is be-
cause all members of the
Davidsonian staff are gay and they
like gay people a lot. Gross.

Dear Eric Slappy,
What do you think of FLAG?
Love,
Georgia Ringle

Dear Georgia Ringle,
I think that those boys and girls
will find their way one day, with the

help of the number one best selling -

book in the world.

Journalistic ethics finally reach
campus with new building

By WALTER KRONKITE
Ghost Writer

President of Americans for an
American Way of being American
Eric Sapp ‘98 was back on campus
for the groundbreaking ceremonies
for the Sapp School of Journalistic
Ethics building this Tuesday. Sapp
also attended his 25th reunion.

Sapp, College President War-
ren Buford, and seven of Davidson’s
nine vice-presidents for fund-rais-
ing took golden shovel to red-clay
dirt to inaugurate the construction.

Sapp has been active in
Davidson activities since his gradu-
ation. He continued his lobbying
for the official recognition of
Veteran’s Day on the academic cal-
endar.

His campaign included Internet
mass-mailings from a site-address,
http//: discriminated.
whiteathletes @arrogance.com, and
Sapp’s moving to Charlotte to at-
tend SGA meetings.

Additionally, Sapp’s efforts to
prevent the teaching of evolution in
Davidson introductory biology
classes were frustrated by an article
published by Libertas. The article
was a compilation of Sapp’s 1995
Davidsonian articles arguing
against the teaching of Darwin’s
theories: The article ran without
comment, and soon Sapp’s on-cam-
pus support fizzled.

Inapress conference, Sapp said
he noticed the need for a school of
journalistic ethics when he was a
student here. “I noticed a rampant,

appalling abuse of power among
the editors. They would advance
biased opinions and then leave the
editorials unsigned. They were the
only people allowed to cower in
anonymity,” he said. “The front
page became a soap-box for their
causes. For instance, a prejudiced
SGA denied a religious group its
charter because the group is ho-
mophobic.

Well, the editors put the story
on the front page, and don’t you
know it, the group got its charter
back the next week. That sort of
journalistic activism has no place at
Davidson.”

Thanks to Eric Sapp The
Davidsonian will never again print
an biased, opinated article as
“news.”

Come one, come all ...

swing set extravaganza!

Charlotte's largest nudist playground!

Davidsonian staff wins spelling bee this weekend

By Jon COPENHAGEN AND
MakrIE CLAIRE JONICK
Spelling Bees

Keeping up there grand
traditioné- of speling, The
Davidsonainaian staff one a really
big old spelin’ be this weakend.

They broughte home the trofy
after spellling the name of the Chair-
man of they’re Bored of
Trusteeeeees corect. His name is

Sex and all that

from page 1

the SBI is for. We came here and
learned that almost every student
was currently breaking the law or
had broken the law during his or her
time here.”

With a laugh, Winston says,
“Now I enjoy a good blowjob as
much as the next guy, but the com-
munity just wouldn’t let up. They
were thirsty for student blood. One
of the most vocal councilmen kept
saying something about, ‘those darn
immoral kids at that school messing
upagoodcommunity,’ and although
I personally thought he was a wacko,
we received orders from above to
raid the school.

“Wow, there was some crazy
stuff, I tell you. Kids were doing
everything from the old hand under
the shirt over the boob trick to per-
forming oral sex on one another in

public. Can you believe that?

There’s actually a fraternity party
where people perform sexual acts
for money. The young woman who
won last year has confessed to per-
forming fellatio on a guy on the
dance floor, in front of everybody
else at the party.”

. Winston declares, “It was pretty
much cut and dry after that. We

’ pretended tobe students, like Johnny

Depp on that 27 Jump Street show,
and after we’d collected enough
evidence to prosecute, we arrested
the lot of them.”

Referring to the process of col-
lecting evidence, he says, “It was
fun. Let’s just leave it atthat, okay?”

An anonymous staff person in
the Residence Life Office says, “I’ ve
seen some wild things, believe you
me. A while ago, I was walking
across Patterson Court at night, and
I came across this couple on the
sidewalk, buck naked and trying to
have sex. Iimmediately called cam-
pus police, and they sent down an
officer to make the arrest.”

The RLO staff member states
that the young man who was ar-
rested appeared unable to perform

because, “Well, he looked pretty.

see Sex! on page 5

Olin Nisbet. They know this, al-
though they atttempted to spell it
Olin Frankfurter.

Butthen some one on teh staffe
came and told them that it was
Nisbet, not Nesbit or Frankfurter.

“You learn from mistaykes!”
said one eponymous member of the
staffe.

The staffe also spelled corect
Kir ken-doll, experiences,
recccomendation, reprocussion,
paitable, and persue.

“Congratulationis,” says daen
shandle. “We new you had it in
you!”
