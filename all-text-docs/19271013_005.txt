| Date Set in Middle of Week for
First Time in History

|

| Tuesday, November Ist, has been set
| aside by the Pan-Hellenic Council as general
| fraternity bid day. On this day the bids will
be given to the Freshmen by the fraternities
| desiring them. This will be the first time
jin the history of fraternities at Davidson
i that the bids will be given in the middle of
}the week. This was done in order that all
| fraternity men would be on the Hill. It was
| found in the, past that many men were away
jon football trips.

| Monday night, October 21st, all Freshmen
jare to be out of the fraternity houses by
10:30 p.m. The day of silence starts at this
time. from then until 7:30 on the following
night, no fraternity man is to speak to any

Freshinan, that has been bid by his fra-
ternity, except to speak in passing him on
the campus.

In contrast to last year, the bids will be
carried around by the representatives of the
Pan-Hellenic Council. The bids last year
were mailed out. After 7:30 Tuesday, all
Freshmen that have no conflicting bids, will

go ta the house of their chatee. Those that
have more than one bid will remain in their
rooms, and each of the fraternities bidding
them will be allowed half an hour in confer-
ence with the Freshman, Not more than two
fraternity men will be allowed to talk to one
Freshman. After’ the conferences, the
Freshmen will be given a halt hour in which
to make up their minds, after which they will
go tothe house of their choice,

It will be noticed that the only differences
from dast year fies in the fact that the bids
will be issued in the middle of the week, and

that the bids will be carried around instead
Joi being mailed,

| Although no definite penalty has been set
}for an infraction of these rules, any person
disregarding them will be treated severely by
the Pan-Hellenie Council,

Dr. Hood Speaks to _
' Ministerial Group

Sunday, October Sth, the Ministerial
Band met at 2:30 in Shearer Hall. Dr.
Hood was the speaker. He gave some prac-
tical hints to prospective ministers as laymen
and psychologist. The program was a simple
one, consisting of a few hymns, and prayers
by Estridge and Brown.

Dr, Hood took his first text from 1, Corin-
thians 16:13, “Watch ye, stand fast in the
faith, quit you like men, be strong,” and II
| Timothy 2:5, “And if also a man contend in
ithe games, he is not crowned, except he have
contended lawfully.” He said that to be a
successful preacher one must obey the laws
connected with preaching. Psychological
laws which are God's laws in the field of
psychology, are vitally connected with
preaching. The two epistles of Paul to
Timothy form one of the best manuals a
young man preparing for the ministry could
read. ‘They contain much practical advice.
One piece of advice that Paul gives to young
Timothy is to give attendance to reading.
Proper reading is a very important part of
the service,

Dr. Hood gave three mechanics of service
to help in the mastery of the pulpit: selection
of hymhs, reading, drés§ of pulpit. Our
hymns are one ot the church’s richest herit-
ages from an ancient and- honorable past.
There is a tendency to neglect them for the
modern songs. This ought not to be done,
las the hymns have a more spiritual music.
| Some preachers pay as much attention to
| the choice of their hymns as to the prepara-
{tion of their sermons. Reading properly fs
really the most important mechanic. The
reading of -hymns should be metrical as to
read otherwise destroys the beauty of the
original. Besides, it is important that the
congregation remember the hymns, and they
are better remembered if read metrically,

‘| Reading of scripture should be intelligent-and

careful, making the thought grip the minds °
of the hearers.. The dress. while in the pulpit
should be such as to attract attention neither

oy

by its flashiness or by its sombreness. —
