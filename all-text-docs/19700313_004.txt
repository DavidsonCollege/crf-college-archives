Tom Murphy Calls For ‘Active Doers,
Tells Of Ministry-At-Large To Hippies

By JEFF ALLENDER
Staff. Writer

Citing the need for ‘‘ac-
tive doers’’ among current
college students, social
worker Rev. Tom Murphy
told of his work in Wash-
ington, D. C. in the Métri- *
son room Tuesday morning.

Murphy started working
out of the Pilgrims in the
Dupont Circle area of the
nation’s capital three years
ago, paid by funds from a
grant from the Board of
Ministries.

He acted as minister - at
large to the Dupont’ Circle
area, which is the ‘‘center
of the hippie sub-culture in
Washington, if. you can say,
the area has a hippie sub-
culture.” The Circle is also
the loeation of various bars
and taverns.

“1 started out by going
to the bars fairly often,
wearing my clerical collar
and just acting normal. |
tried to be visibly present
as a churchman’ where
churchmen usually go to be
invisible,’ Murphy explained.

Nelson Forsees
Farm Revolution

Undeveloped
tions which are experienc-
ing an agricultural -  busi-
ness revolution through the
use of new ‘miracle grains”
need to encourage young
people to become enterpren-
eurs.

That opinion of Davidson
College economics professor
Louise Nelson was recently
published by the U. S. Con
gress in a report entitled
“The Green Revolution.”

New ‘miracle grains’ de-
veloped by U. S. scientists
are enabling underdeveloped
Nations around the world to
grow far more abundant
crops than ever _ before,
causing a “Green Revolu-
tion” on their farms.

In order to adapt to the
booming agriculture pro-
duction and the business
operations related to it, Dr.
Nelson recommends that
rural towns in the develop-
ing nations should seek ‘“‘tal-
ented, educated, urbanized
young. people’’ and train
them in the methods and
benefits of business leader-
ship,

acclaims as ‘‘an~~

He would do nothing until
someone ‘approached him,
then just tried to ‘‘fill the
needs” of the people he was
serving—in advisory capaci-
ty, or in any way, letting
them know the church real-
ly cared about them.

After his efforts were es-
tablished in’ the community,
Murphy added, other. people
came up with more ideas.
First to come into reality
was the«'‘Mustard Seed," a
combination coffee - house
and soup kitchen, in the
church, set up to be a sort
of “indoor park.” The run-
away and “hippie’ kids, as
well as others, came in
bringing problems, he said,
and the place averaged 100
150 people a_ night.

“We gave them a _ place
to come to, and many of
them brought along their
problems for advice. We.
had doctors and psy-
chiatrists come on an un
structured basis.”

A free clinic was set up
at another church in George-
town, and then Runaway
House, where runaway kids
could come for a place to
stay when they start cut.
Three young adult coun-
selors there help ,about 50
kids a month, according to
Murphy, as they force the
kids to think through their
situation and the alterna-
tives.

The idea of Runaway
‘House, he’ commented, is to
establish communication be-

even

tween the teens and their
parents. ‘In most cases,
communication between a
kid) and his parents never
began until the kid left
home. Runaway House is
known as a_ place where

they can go to get help in
working things out with
their parents.”

Murphy cited one of the
main problems of the facili
ty as being that Runaway
House is reduced to the
“crisis intervention” stage

said. ‘| just want to see
this house stay open and ac-
tive, and it appears that the
only way that this can be
done is to change the’ pre-
sent’ system at the house so
that -we can meet our finan-
cial obligations.”

“Things at the Machi house
aren’t doomed at all,” Hur-
witz Goncluded. ‘I’m opti-
mistic that the change will
put the house on its feet
once again.”

Several complications still

exist for the, house, how-
ever, besides the financial
troubles. First, active and

capable leadership must be
found, according to several
members.

Debaters Tackle

Major Tourneys

During the winter term
this year, Davidson's de-
bate team has attended four
major debate tournaments.

The first tournament was
at Old Dominion University
— the ‘Sweetheart
tional’’ Tournament held on
Feb. 13 and 14. Represent-
ing Davidson were the teams
of Scott-Deininget and Esk-
ridge-Davis. In the tourna-
ment, Scott and Deininger
came out with a record of
3-3 and Eskridge and Davis
with a 24 record. Mike
Scott won individual honors
with a trophy for having
second place speaker points.

Davidson's varsity  debat-
ers also attended the Dart-
mouth Invitational Tourna-
ment in February. The team
of “Gray (Mason and Danny
Clodfelter compiled a 1-7

Inyita-_

record at this prestigious
tournament.
Mason and Bill Eskridge

were Davidson's representa-
tives to the Citadel Invitd-
tional Tournaraent in the
senior “varsity division. The
team won four debates and
lest only two to be the sixth
seeded team in the tourna-
ment. The Citadel Tourna-
ment was held from Febru-
ary 27 through 28.

The last tournament of
the term in which David-
son was represented was the
Gulf Coast Tournament held
on March 6 and 7 in Florida.
Seott and Mason attended
and compiled a 3-5 record.

Although the debate team
did not have a sparkling re-
cord for this term). the team
hopes to improve its record
in the spring term.

tween the two forces start-
ed. <
They try to get the family

together with their family
pastor, or some other per-
son, to ‘keep the  long-

range dialog going.” Many
of the people coming to: the
House, he commented, are
kids from broken homes or
military families, where the
father may not be around
much of the time.

“The kids show that they
really want to get back with
their parents again,) if it’s
possible to resolve the dif-
ficulties,” he added. More
than 80 per cent of the kids
coming there go back home,
and ‘most do not repeat,” he
added.

Trouble with the police
was expectable, Murphy ex
plained, so ‘“‘we decided we
wouldn’t let them in with-
out a search warrent.

“There’s nothing they can
do to us for harboring
these kids, even if their
parents do put up a fuss,

since malicious intent must
be established for there to
be grounds for a charge of
contributing to the delin-
quency of a minor.’;

Of the police force, though,
he said that

men. The police force, as it
is now, is hard on good hu-
man beings.

- About the problems in the
church today, ‘Murphy com-
mented that the church has
become the ‘Palace Priest

the middle class wants to

killed by its popularity.

When asked about drug
.abuse problems he has come
across, and what he is.
doing about it in his minis-
try, he answered that the
“major drug problem is
that everybody thinks we
have a drug problem. The
panic and_ hysterical over-
reaction often involved is
often more destructive than
the

drugs used,” he ex-
plained.
“I'm convinced that ithe

majority of high school kids
are experimenting with
drugs, the vast majority of
the adult population has
been taking drugs, either
legal or illegal, and kids’
have thus been taught that
there is a chemical solution
for their problems.”

There are two types of
kids who take drugs, he
added—those who feel the
need to identify with the
“hippie drug sub-culture,”
and those who take them
for psychological needs.

This latter category in-
cludes people that are just
seeking a more intense ex-

perience, while the other
group contains the people
that are unlikely to stop

with harmless drugs.

“When I first got the idea
for this piece three sum-

symphony,” Richey explain

was so strong that I decided
to write a concerto for violin
and orchestra.’

Richey said that his wife
Elaine, first violinist of the
Charlotte Symphony, was “‘a
great help’’ in the composi-
tion of the piece.

The concerto has_ three
movements. These vvnd

piece featuring muted trum-

solo which represents my
response to what I see and
hear.”

“The third movement, in
