COOL GUY

The second student. the cool
guy, js well-dressed with his
hair “long. but not too long.”
He bas attended prep school and
finds at least one of his college
texta fanilllar.

He begins to cut Saturday
classes, and soon, “between foat-
ball games and dates at Queens,
between trips to Hattle’s and
bull sesaions at the house,’ a
four day week becomes habit
ual.

The Inst type, the grind, prob:
ably comes [rom a smull high

linn where he ranked first in hix
class.

lines important passnges in his

class. He even spends an occa.
sional Sawrday night stuclying,
And when the grades come mut
he barely passes,

Abbott concluded that cach of
these types had a common fault
—a Jack of courage. The grind
lacks the cournge to think. He
is afraid to step Into the world
“outside of cow, an amorphous
world of ideas where you have
ta live with uncertainty . . . to
know that you will never know,”

RESIST PRESSURE

The cool guy also lacks cour-

failure fs the lack of courage

to risk belng wrong." Abbott
