By MIKE MYERS

Cool was 1, and logical. Keen,
calculating, perspicacious, acute and
astuze—! was all of these. My
brain was powerful as a dynamo,
as precise as a chemist’s scales, as
penetrating as a scalpel. And—
think of it! I was only a fresh.
man, and about to be rushed!

1 liked the brother who had
come to get me. As we walked
arm in arm, hammer lock in ham-
mer lock, 1 couldn't help but feel
content and 1 smiled inwardly, We
walked slowly, listening to the
gravel crunch satisfactorily under
our shoes in the still twilight,
breathing the thin evening air. But
my mind was miles away—all the
way back to Cinnamon Gulch, to
my last week ‘at home, to Agnes...

.. “EU wait for you. I'll wait
for you forever,” she had said.

“Tell them to take care of my
little boy,” Mother had said.

“There's never been a_ better
father than 1 am to that boy,”
Father had said.

But now I was about to be ex-

posed to the great American fra-
ternity system. The very thought
thrilled me. [I favored my com-
panion with a smile.

My brain, that precision instru-

ment, slipped into high year, “Why
yes, now that you mention it. Just

Customs. They had the most ridicu-
!ous method for choosng a mate

laugh it's so silly.

a row: then all the single men
who can pronounce ‘pftjetzero’ pa-
rade by. Each girl. then does her
most appealing dance for the men.
If a male can climb a coconut tree
quicker than his rivals, -or if he
has a real mullock bone entwined
jn his hair, chances are she will
like him. But she does the saine
song and dance for each boy, even
if she doesn't like him.

But here's the senseless part.
The boy and girl are allowed. to

only and the male is not allowed
to talk during this time, yet the
choice must be made.

The male chooses on merit of the
best dance. and the female goes by
the anality of bone in her lover's
hair. If she wants him she sticks
a straw up his nostril while he
sleeps, If he accepts her offer he
comes and joins in the dance wit
her. Isn't that the craziest thing
yuu've ever heard of?"

We had rounded the corner and
were starting up the path to the
house. “But get this,” [ went on.
“The marriage is only a_ trial.
The girl can end it anytime by
cutting out her lover's heart and
the matter is forgotten.”

The lights and noise up ahead
quickened my pulse. My excite-
ment grew, “It’s a good

New Fire Truck

Any fires in Davidson_now have
a good chance of heing = ex-
tinguished. The reason? A_ brand
new. fire truck was procured in late
June. ;

According to a Charlotte fire in-
structor it is the best in this part
of the country, Jerry Small, who
usually drives the machine, was
just as enthusiastic about it an he
yrraciously demonstrated its capa-
bilities to a Davidsonian reporter.

Costing $11,000 when purchased

h{ fram the Mack Truck Company,

the vehicle has a 500-gallon booster
tank (200 more than the old truck),
400 feet of reel hose, modern fog-
throwing nozzles, five forward
transmission gears, three centrifu-
yal pumps and an ingenious dual
ignition system which allows the
truck motor to run on either of
its two banks of six cylinders or
all 12. simultaneously. The col-
lege contributed $2,500 toward the
cost of this new truck.

Small reported that the truck
will be able to put out at least
90 per cent of the fires which
could happen here.

He was quick to add that this
truck is equipped with a self-
starter,

Graduating from Davidson in
