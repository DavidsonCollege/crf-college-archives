Apocalypse Now examines Heart of Darkness in Vietnam

By MIKE STEPHENS

Opening with scenes of the Vietnamese
jungle and the haunting sounds of Jim Mor-
rison’s strained tenor voice, Francis Ford
Coppola’s “Apocalypse Now” takes its vie-
wers on a trip up-river into what Joseph
Conrad called the “Heart of Darkness.”
Coppola takes John Milius’ screenplay re-
telling Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, a tale
of greed and megalomania in the depths of
colonial Africa, and presents it in the con-
text of the Vietnam War.

Willard, brilliantly portrayed by Martin
Sheen, receives strictly confidential orders
from military headquarters in Saigon. They
instruct him to “terminate the command” of
Col. Kurtz, who has illegally entered Cam-
bodia. If any resistance is offered, he is to
“terminate the Colonel.” The Saigon mili-
tary command, over a rich dinner of shrimp
and roast beef, informs Willard that Kurtz,
once a fine officer, has gone insane.

To one familiar with Heart of Darkness,
the plot of “Apocalypse Now” offers no sur-
prises. The strength of the movie lies in the
way Coppola presents the advance of a

boat-load of reasonably believable charac-
ters into the insanity of the Vietnam war.
Willard boards a small military craft headed
toward Cambodia. That the captain of the
vessel, fiercely protective of his men and
his boat, dislikes and distrusts Willard, sets
up one of the major conflicts of the movie.

The other servicemen on the boat,
mostly young draftees, seem misplaced in
the frenzied jungle. Lance, a former surfing
pro from California, plays an increasingly
important role as the movie progresses.
Coppola presents the various individuals
commanding authority in the war as carica-
tures of reality. Robert Duval, leading an
Air Mobile squadron of helicopters, be-
comes one of the most memorable charac-
ters. He begins his attacks by playing
Wagner’s “Ride of the Valkyres” from
large speakers mounted beneath the
helicopters. After destroying a heavily for-
tified beach-front encampment primarily
because the area had good peaks for surf-
ing, Duval utters the now famous line, “I
love the smell of napalm in the morn-
ing . . . it smells like victory.”

After a series of stops along the river,
involving everything from a show-casing of
playboy bunnies to a rather large tiger, Wil-
lard finally enters Cambodia. Signs of
death, almost synonymous with Kurtz, are
everywhere. Upon reaching his jungle
“kingdom,” Willard finally meets Kurtz,
played by a grossly obese and overpaid
Marlin Brando.

The movie does not have the same sharp
ending as Conrad’s Heart of Darkness.
Several loose ends are left unresolved, but
purposely so. Coppola did not intend his
production to be tidy.

“Apocalypse Now” is not an easy movie
to watch. It is long and draining, but proba-
bly worth the effort. Martin Sheen does an
excellent job, becoming the single thread of
sanity running throughout the film. Robert
Duval’s performance alone merits the en-
trance price. Much in the way “A
Clockwork Orange” sifts the contents of its
viewers’ mind, “Apocalypse Now” asks its
viewers to define sanity in a world where re-
straint has no place.
