Review ‘Sicilian traveler rambles

By Bill Barnes
Staff Writer
Silician Carousel, by Lawrence Dur-
rell, Viking Press, $10.00, 256 pp.

Sicily, just off the toe of Italy
across from Reggio Calabria, seems
on a map something of an after-
thought, a can about to be booted
toward Gibraltar. In Silician Carousel
novelist, poet and professional trav-
eler Lawrence Durrell portrays the
island as anything but.

For Durrell, Sicily is more contin-
ent than island, packed with momen-
toes of five civilizations. Escaping his
French home ‘‘for a change’’, Durrell
embarked on the ‘Sicilian Carousel’
—a red bus carrying a motley group
of tourists—for a glimpse of the
island.

The book chronicles this journey, a
jaunt undertaken and intertwined,
however, with more than tourism in
mind. Durrell’s Sicilian visit was in
large part a pilgrimage in memory of a
recently dead friend, Martine, who
lived in and loved Sicily. The trave-
logue which provides the core of this
vaguely picturesque book is therefore
interspersed with quotations from
Martine’s many letters. These often
prove points of departure for medita-
tions on Athens, ‘‘Greater Greece’,
philosophy, and Durrell’s own past as
well as on Sicily.

The letters also cause Durrell to
reflect on his fellow tourists. The red
bus which conveys the group about
the island contains a mixed bag of
bourgeois, from a French family
quickly nicknamed the ‘‘microscopes”’
to a renegade English schoolmaster.
The most interesting of the lot,
however, soon becomes Deeds, a
sometime officer in the British Eighth
Army who soon becomes Durrell’s
friend.

Deeds, with his annotated guide-
books, desert-war jargon, and con-
stant commentary, is an effective foil

to Durrell’s meditations. As the tour
winds around Sicily from Syracuse
through Naxos, Agrigento, Segestus,
to Messina and Taormina these
meditations acquire an independence
from both Deeds’ and Martine’s as
Durrell comes to know the island and
to make his own judgments.

This process, however, occupies the
bulk of the book, and Durrell is never
able to free himself completely from
Martine’s Sicily. As a result, the
volume tends to appear elegaic, proof
that Durrell does not forget his

her words flowing with the love
characteristic of a devotee of place.
The travel book is thus somewhat
lost among the memories which crowd
its pages, but Carousel nevertheless
succeeds admirably as a companion;
it would be a fine book to cart about
Sicily as one. Durrell’s description is
consistently fine, as is his characteri-
zation of his fellow travelers. Not to
mention his poetry, which appears in
Carousel in the form of several

The poems are perhaps the most
enjoyable aspect of the book. They
create a mood sometimes absent from

sorrow, presence and absence. ‘Thus
and thus we shall remember you,”

ting both the poem and Carousel to

Sicily itself, but of the Mediterranean
