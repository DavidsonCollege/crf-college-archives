More Truth Than Bull!
When a “rat” we take it all,
“When a “soph” we give it all.
When a junior we watch it all,
And when a senior we say,
“What a fool I’ve been.”—Ex.

It is a startling fact, says Professor Carr,
that a Polar Bear doesn’t know the dif-
{ference between a whisk broom and a
billiard ball, “Furthermore,” said he,
{“the great explorer, Eric Meathall, of
New Zealand, discovered that it is next

Who Was Shot and Who Was Not?
“A duel was lately fought by Alexander
Shott and John S. Nott. Nott was shot
and Shott was not. In this case it was
hetter to be Shott than Nott. There was
ja rumor that Nott was not shot, but
| Shott avows that he was not, which
| proves either that the shot Shott shot at
Nott was not shot, or that Nott was shot
nothwithstanding.

It may be made to appear on trial that
|the shot Shott shot shot Nott, or, as ac-
cidents with firearms are frequent, it may
be possible that the shot Shott shot shot
Shott himself when the whole affair
would resolve itself into its original ele-
ment, and Shott would be shot and Nott
would be not.

Some folks think, however, that the
shot Shott shot, shot, not Shott, but Nott.

Can you tell who was shot?

“There’s something in that,” said the
detective as he stuck his head in the cus-
pidor.

GLEE CLUB MAKES HIT AT __
LENOIR WITH JAZZ BAND

The Davidson College Glee Club, which |
has been giving splendid performances dur-|
ing the past year, went to Lenoir last Sat- |
urday night. This performance is reported |
the hest performance of the year. They |
made the trip in cars, returning the same |
night. This was the last performance of
the year that was scheduled, except for Ju-
nior Speaking.

Lenoir entertained the members of the
club highly. A good many of the boys were
entertained in the homes of some of the
town people. The program was somewhat
crippled by two of the most important mem-
bers of the Symphony Orchestra being ab-
sent. However, the Dixie Novelty Seven
came to the rescue and lived up to their
reputation of always delighting the audience.
This was used in several cases to fill in place
of the Symphony Orchestra. Liston Elkins
sang several songs, playing his own accom-
paniment on the guitar. The audience re-
ceived him well. In spite of the bad weather
the house was full. Davenport College was
well represented and also the town people
turned out well. Davidson men always ‘en-
joy going to Lenoir because they are so well
received.

Dear Uncle Bud,

I am afraid that I don’t drink enough

three sponge cakes as I am told that they |

have a remarkable affinity for the fluid

Dear Lee,

The worst T ever heard is about Jerry

thirsty or hungry.

But that is not all. When they walk-
ed out of the place they ran across a
Salvation Army (of about fifty
winters), Jerry’s girl asked her what
her business was. She replied, “My mis-
sion is saving men.” Whereupon Jerry's
fair companion said, “Well, save one for
me then.” The Q. B.
