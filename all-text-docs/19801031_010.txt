The Bricks & Doughboys report on favorite IMAC. teams & alumnus

By THE BRICK BROTHERS
and THE DOUGHBOYS

The honorable writers of BB .

& DB have received many an
impassioned letter in recent
days imploring us to spend
more time on flickerball in the
column. This week we shall
pander to those desires by
presenting BB & DB’s annual
poll of the worst 5 flickerball
teams. None of these teams are
worth jack and they don’t
deserve to be mentioned, but we
will anyway in the interests of
egalitarianism. ;

5. The Bud Studs— This team
is absolutely pathetic. Only tow
of the players on the team have
motor control over all four
limbs. And both of these guys
are blind. Their major problem
comes from having 2 SPE hall
counselors. Fortunately only
one of these plays, or else the
team would be ranked much
lower.

4. Sequoia—The amazing
thing about this team is that
they are seniors, they aren’t
SPE’s or PIKA’s, and they’re
still awful at flickerball. It’s
hard to explain, but their record
bears it out. They’ve scored 12
points and allowed 4,256 this
year. Why do they keep play-
ing?

3. PIKA #1—Considering the
team, we shudder at the
thought of a PIKA #2 squad.
PIKA #1 is another case of a
team where experience only
seems to confuse them. If it was
possible for them to get worse
with age, they would.

2. Old Men— Again this year
the Old Men have shown a
complete inability to win a big
game. Chronicling their success
in big games over the last few
years is like chronicling Joby’s
success during exams. BB &
DB would like to suggest to the

Old Men that they change their —

name to the Italian Army.
While they’re at it they might
as well all Pledge SPE.

1. SPE—The Spe team is the

elixir for Freshmen Halls. Once
again, as was:the case last year
in every IMAC sport including
pinball and bumper pool, the
SPE’s are the worst. Despite a
plethora of practice sessions
and chalk talks this year, the
SPE’s couldn’t pull themselves
out of the doldrums once again.

There was some important
action this past week in the
flickerball world. THe KA’s
coninued on with an unscathed
record after doing in PIKA #1
and Half Mast. Half Mast was
expelled from the league by the
ghost of KA past (Percy) for
obnoxiousness by Chris Nor-
wood, Bob Trobich, and Andy
Brown. The KA’s performance
can only be termed peripatic
since their’s is the wéakest
division.

In another weak division the
SAE’s coasted by all their

‘opponents including arch-rival

At Your Cervix, who forfeited.
Joby leads the defending
champs who play stupid flicker-
ball.

In the only good division ther
were some big games. Hurtin 4
Certin, which has announced
the retirement of ex-legend,
Minor Sinclair, beat the Old
Men to a pulp 33-7. SHi and
Stroud missed the game, but
Gardner, Hine, and a few other
fuddy-duddies did make it. THe
Bushwackers ‘cemented their
position as flickerball’s best
freshmen team by losing only
by one point ot the Flamin’
Chucks. Mike, Turley, and a
few wimpy KA’s pulled it out
for them.

In the biggest game of the
year the upstart Rastros beat
Hurtin 4 Certin 33-31. Despite
the fact Blaine and X had given
up early in the game, H4C came
back to make it close. High-
light of the game was a crushing
collision between Murrah and
Beaver which left both for them
gasping for air. Murrah got four
stitches while Beaver lost two
teeth which turned the game in

The last thing we'd like to
include this week is a rather
touching and poignant note we
received from one of our good
friends and a former IMAC
lerformer. His name is Minor
Sinclair, and as we mentioned
before he has retired from
flickerball.

Dear Guys,

As a senior, guys, things just
aren’t coming together. As I
look back on four years of
Davidson, I’ve got to ask,
why?, about a lot of things.

There are so many things to
think about —career goals, lost
love, KA, and how so many of

us just (urinated) the last years
of our life away. One does
develop good friendships and
one does get prepared well for
the rough-and-tumble years a-
head—but may I ask, is it
worth *it? Is it worth the
hypocrisy of the administra-
tion, those dead Saturday
nights, and those long trips
back home to Auburn? I know
I’m spilling my heart out to you
guys, but what are friends for?
Without the Jobys (although
we've not gotten along per-
fectly),
Terrys, how could I justify the
expenditure and money I’ve
spent at Davidson?

As you can tell, a lot has been |
going through my mind lately. -

mann and Norman Vincent

Maybe now you can understand
why I've quit flickerball. So
many different things are hap-
pening within me, I just don’t
feel I can concentrate on flicker-
ball when I’m out there. Thanks
for hearing me out.
Best of Everything,

Minor
