Beyond Birkenstock:

World Peace? Think Birkenstock

Kyle and Seth's excellent adventure in Journalism

Q: What’s the difference be-
tween the Soviet Communist Party
and the American Democratic
Party?

A: Up until a week ago, the
Communists still had a sliver of a
chance of winning their Presi-
dential election!

Boy, it’s going to be a wonder-
ful year, isn’ tit? Communistcoups,
choleric court confirmations and,
of course, a couple of crack con-
servative columnists to cover itall.
In case you’re new, or in case
you’ve forgotten this column and
every other picce of redeeming
literature you read last year, this
little piece of journalistic enlight-
enment is the closest thing to real
political commentary you're ever
likely to read (in all modesty). In
fact, Cut it Out and save it; who
knew the Mona Lisa would be
worth so much back when all the
girls had ambiguous smiles and
big .. . tracts of land.

But just in case you’re won-
dering, this column and its authors
are not biased towards conserva-
lism per se, juslils pragmatic good
sense. Now, we may occasionally
cast a jaundiced eye at some
Democratic foible, but that in no
way makes this biased journalism.
Believe us, if the Republicans were

evertodo something similarly silly
(they haven’t yet),we would cer-
tainly point it out.

But enough about us. How
“bout those Bears? The Commu-
nist Bears, that is. Did we make the
call, or what? (At the risk of nar-
cissism, we’ ll quote ourselves early
and often for the

Gorby’s little helpers on the State
of Emergency Committee were his
Own appointees. Had Gorbachev
spent half as much time instilling a
sense of institutional restraint and
reaffirming constitutional law as
he did appeasing hardliners and
making g00-goo eyes to the west-

of democracy is, perhaps, nearer to
the truth. After all, these men were
his friends, his cabinet. Those who
lie down with dogs are apt to arise

with fleas.
Now here’s where it gets good.
“« . [T)here is an alternative.
Boris Yeltsin has always been the
odd man out in American

benefit of those who
haven’t bothered to
memorize past
Birks).

“The dilemma,
surely, is whether
Gorbachev can hold
his Robespierres in
check until the econ-
omy provides a fi-
nancial base in
which political re-
form can take place.
Atleast, that’s what
the political pundits
scem to think (they

foreign policy. Pretty
common compared to the
likes of George Bush and
Edward Shevardnadze.
Yet, his popular appeal
(something Gorbachev
lacks) is coupled with a
vision of an autonomous
(i.e. deUnionized) Soviet
Union that would allow
- the various republics to
join economically as trad-
ing partners, and think
about political re-Union
later.”
Goodness,
wasn’t the signing of a

Iraq, weren’tthey?).
It’salso possible that
Gorbachev has progressed as far
as he is genetically able. He is,
was, and always will be a party
man. His consolidation of power
in the presidency, although por-
trayed as a positive necessity for
democratization could also be used
for tyranny. You think?”

We thought. Remember, all of

It's Too Bad Freshmen
Aren't In Charge Here

For the past several days, my
roommate and I have lived the
freshman life. As hall counselors,
we’ve done all the old familiar
things: we’ve been to the Cake
Race, we’ve done our time in
Love Auditorium, we’ve mixed,
and we’ve mixed, and we’ve
mixed. Quite frankly, I was begin-
ning to think that ‘maybe I was a
freshman all over again, but then I
remembered that no, that couldn’t
possibly be true. After all, my
schedule wasn’t as good as my
hallmates, the American Express
man wasn’t at all interested in
giving me acredit card, and one of
the ladies in the bookstore hooted
at my excuse that I didn’t know
better when I lost my receipt. But
even in spite of all that, I still felta
little like a freshman, until today,
that is.

This afternoon, the hall con-
gregated in my room. I offhand-
edly mentioned to my roommate
that I didn’t have the vaguest clue
as to what I ought to write about in
THE DAVIDSONIAN, and the
onslaught began. As the words
rolled off my lips, every freshmen
in the room was opining fervently,
writhing uncontrollably like snakes
in a small pit. I was afraid.

They debated every conceiv-
able issue. Why on earth would
anyone want to be politically cor
rect? Why on earth would anyone
want to be politically incorrect?

Why is Davidson so homogene-
ous? Why is Davidson so hetero-
geneous? What about aquaintance
rape, racism, sexism, and homo-
phobia?

An hour and a half later, after
the panel had disbanded, my room-
mate and_I shut the door, looked at
each other, and said only, “Good
Lord.”

At first I thought again, it’s like
being a freshman for the second

time. On my frehman hall two -

years ago, such conversations were
astaple: we lived to try torightthe
wrongs of the world, and the great
thing was, we never even had to
leave the room to do so. But after
having remembered this, I was sort
of struck by the realization that I
hadn’t even witnessed such a con-
versation since I left for the sum-
mer after my freshman year. At
some point a cynicism of sorts
must have set in: I guess I “got
real” and everyone else did too.
I do not mean to suggest that
freshman, because they are one.
two, or three years younger than
the rest of us, are naive and unreal-
istic. In fact, I think quite the oppo-
site of that is true. I just think the
rest of us sort of gave up on ideal-
ism. After today, I’m convince
that if the freshmen were in charge
around here; they could do almost
everything short of ending world

‘hunger. Of course, the rest of us

are just too damn tired.

em press corps, the Soviet Union
might never have been plunged
into those three days of darkness.

Do we blame Gorbachev for
the coup (Oh horror of horrors!)?
Partially; although ultimate respon-
sibility rests with his betrayers,
Gorbachev was hardly a prisoner
of war. A prisoner of his own fear

treaty that would move the
Soviet Union in the direc-
tion we described the event that
provoked the right into toppling
Gorbachev? A document, remem-
ber, that was eked outof Gorbachev
largely at Yeltsin’s insistence. It
would have radically altered the
Soviet Union, transforming itintoa
confederacy on the order of Can-
ada, similar to the one we described

so many Birks ago.

So, the moral here, boys and
girls, is relatively simple; had the
Russian leadership (particularly

Gorbachev) been reading The

Davidsonianrather than theirown
pulp journalism for the last year or
so (excluding all that Feminist/
Politically Correct dribble), they
would have sensed the winds of
change. Democracy would have
beenachieved peacefully (it’skind
ofaBilland Ted effect) and mother
Russia would have entered the
twenty-first century a thriving,
cosmopolitan society. And it’s
just too bad, too.

No need tothank us. But, ifall
the world’s leaders start reading
“Beyond Birkenstock” RIGHT
NOW, maybe we can achieve
world peace by 1996, when the
Republicans retake control of
Congress. Just to rub it in though
(we closed the Gorbachev column
with a bang), we’ll use the won-
derful journalistic technique
of self-quotation one more time in
licu of thinking up something new.

“Remember, revolutions by
definition are a violent repudia-
tion of the old political order, with
the emphasis on violence. Change
will come, whether we like it or
not. By refusing to help Yeltsin
now, we may not get aride atall.” :
