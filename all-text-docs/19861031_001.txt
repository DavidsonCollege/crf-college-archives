Wicker speaks on party relationships

By TOM MOORE

“American politics is about
winning power,” said New York
Times columnist Tom Wicker,
Reynolds’ Lecturer for the 1986-
87 academic year. “The candi-
date’s greatest strength is the
promise to his party that ‘I. can
win, and if I can win, you come
into power with me, and as long as
I stay in power, you stay in power
with me.”” ;

Wicker lectured on “The
News in Perspective” to an esti-
mated crowd of five hundred
Wednesday night in Love Au-
ditorium. Wicker predicted that
although in his view, the Democ-
ratic Party can only win the presi-
dency by “default” of the Republi-
cans, a default is what’s coming in
1988. He also speculated that the
makeup of the next Senate would_
be 51-49. or 52-48 Democrats to
Republicans.

In addition to his syndicated
New York Times column, Wicker
is an associate editor of the paper
and appears on David Brinkley’s
weekly television news forum. He
was a Harvard University Neiman
Fellow and has written several
novels and nonfiction works. His
column appears in the Charlotte
Observer.

One of the main thrusts of his
talk was his view of the changing
relationships between the Ameri-
can political parties.

“We are in a situation where
the Republican Party is the ‘Party
of Government’ in our country.
It’s the party of government be-
cause the party represents a suffi-
cient unity of interests so that in
election years it can pull together

in 1976 because of the Watergate
scandal.”

"It is entirely possible that we
will have a Republican default in
1988,” he said, “not to suggest
another Watergate scandal, but to
suggest that the Republican Party

contest.

“The Democratic party has be-
come the ‘Party of Access.’
Groups that have previously had
no impact on the political process
in this country have been able to
move into the Democratic Party
and have an impact within that
party. With that wide band of in-
terests, it becomes difficult for

that party to pull together in an——

election year so that they can win
the Presidential contest.”

Citing the example of Jimmy
Carter’s win in 1976 over Gerald
Ford, Wicker said, “In my vision
of the way the party relationship
works today, I think that for the
foreseeable future that any Demo-
crat is likely to win the Presidency
only because of a default by the
‘Party of Government.’ The Re-
publican Party defaulted in effect

Ladd became interested in his

old. She was terrified that Wester-
ners, especially an American,
were coming to visit, because she
thought we wanted to kill her (and
other Communists). She did not
even picture us as human beings
and was quite surprised and re-
lieved to see that we were just like
everyone else,” he said.

construed social and political

have a good discussion.”
