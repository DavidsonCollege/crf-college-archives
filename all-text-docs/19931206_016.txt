had only 4 shots. South Carolina
got the first shot of the game after
28 minutes of play when junior
Chris Faklaris had a breakaway
that ended inasave. Virginia would
not get its first shot until 6 minutes
later when Silvera got a good look
at the goal, only to be denied by
Gamecock goalie David Turner.
The Cavaliers would not be denied
much longer as they took the lead
with 5 minutes left in the 1st half
when Mike Fisher placed a corner
kick beautifully and the Carolina
defense allowed Friends to slice in

front of their fullbacks, heading
the ball in for a 1-0 halftime lead.
South Carolina would get its
chances, the best when Steve Pier
had a breakaway 18 minutes into
the second half, but Jeff Causey
made two outstanding saves in a
row to preserve the lead. South
Carolina would get yet another ex-
cellent scoring opportunity when
Billy Ctifford dribbled past the
Cavalier goalie, but a UVa de-
fender managed to sweep in and
prevent the shot.

The Cavaliers' 2nd: goal put
the championship in their pocket.
Appropriately, Nate Friends scored

on a beautiful volley set up by a
Fisher direct kick.

Coach Bruce Arena summed
up the entire tournament and his
teams success this way: "The sport
of soccer is the toughest to win
with its low scoring and ability to
allow an upset. If you survive this
tournament, you are the best team
in college soccer, we've done that
for three years in a row now."

Maybe not next year. The
Cavaliers might make room for a
new national champion with the
probable exit of Claudio Reyna.
Maybe that champion will be the
Wildcats.

Coach reminisces on year

Landis continued from page 14

“They upped their game to make
up for that. They kept up the good
play, which all goes back to us
saying ‘No Excuses.””

But how did this hard-nosed
football guy make such an impres-
sion in his first season on a pro-
gram that saw a number of less
successful years recently?

He says he just picked up the
ball from Fagg’s years and ran
with it. Perhaps more importantly,
though, he made the game more
fun for the players.

“He made it exciting,” senior
Frank Houghton said. “He brought
the fun back into football. ... Also
at his young age, it’s easier for the
players to relate to him and for him
to relate to us.”

Winning is about the only phi-
losophy Landis will claim to pos-
sess, and winning makes the game
more fun.

So while the seeds for this
year’s success may have been sown
under Fagg from the last couple of
years, it was still up to Landis to
motivate the players to stop talk-
ing about winning and actually
doing it.

“Tt is easy to talk about being
successful, and what I’ve learned
is to never let your guard down,”
he said. “I don’t want to talk about
winning, but rather just go out and
do it.

“Let’s go out and win the
game, instead of saying we can

win. It comes down to a commit-
ment, then you have to go out and
prove yourself.”

The players took hold of that
idea and applied it well to their
collective game.

“This whole year was basi-
cally go out and execute and get
the job done,” Houghton said. “The
other stuff would take care of it-
self. We worked hard, gave 110
percent every time out, knowing
that the scoreboard would take care

-of itself. That was we wanted to do

in every practice, every game, ev-
ery meeting, everything that we
did all year.”

Not one to rest on his laurels,
Landis has goals of his own, one in
particular.

He wants to coach at an Ivy
League school, perhaps Princeton,
where growing up, he learned of
the nearly perfect mix of academ-
ics and athletics at work.

“] dream all the time,” Landis
said. “And you have to go out and
try to reach those goals. I certainly
have aspirations of moving up. But
that’s something I have to earn.”

A further part of the appeal is
that athletic programs in Ivy
League schools are similar to
Davidson’s and Landis’ alma
mater, Randolph Macon.

“When you’re playing foot-
ball at this level, it’s because you
love the game,” Landis said, “not

‘because you have aspirations of

the NFL. You’re playing for all the
right reasons.”
