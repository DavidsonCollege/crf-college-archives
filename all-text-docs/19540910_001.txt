The resignation of Athletic Di-
rector Paul K. Scott of Davidson,
was announced today by Presi-
dent John R. Cunningham. Mr.

Scott leaves Davidson after four

and one half years to accept a po-| =

sition as Alumni Secretary at his
Alma Mater, Cornell College at Mt.
Vernon, Iowa, on or before Octo-
ber 15.

In commenting on his regret that
Mr. Scott is leaving Davidson,
President Cunningham said, “The
Davidson College community is dis-
tressed to lose Paut Scott and his
fine family. It is a compliment to
him that his Alma Mater insists
upon his return as Alumni Secre-
tary.

“Mr. Scott has brought to his po-
sition at Davidson .as Director of
Athletics and Physical Education
an intelligent interpretation of the
program which we idealize for our
students. It is a program which in-
cludes all students, offering an op-
portunity for a sound physical de-
velopment to everyone.

“Coming to Davidson, as he did,
just as the new Johnston Gymna-
sium was ready for use, he has de-
veloped a program which in-

Teaching military tactics to
ROTC students may be a far cry
from the rigors of the battlefield.
But a look at the Davidson Col-
lege ROTC Instructor Group shows
that these officers and men know
military matters from actual ex-
perience as well as from the text-
book angle.

R. O, F.C.

The experience of the Davidson
ROTC. staff represents a total of
141 years of military duty which
includes 187 months of combat du-
ty and a total of 470 months of ov-
erseas service. These activities
have taken place in all of the
theaters of World War II and Ko-
rea. They represent combat action
in a majority of the campaigns of
Europe, Africa, Italy, Burma, and
the South Pacific, as well as the
recent campaigns in Korea. These
instructors have the training and
first hand knowledge of warfare
necessary to make them imminent-
ly qualified to instruct the future
officers of the Army. They know
the “tricks of the trade.”

The following biographical
sketch of the military personnel on
duty here at Davidson clearly out-
lines the military experience pro-
vided by the Army for the training
of Davidson ROTC cadets:

made in the usual procedure. He

Denmark, Finland
Send Students Here

Two new special students come
to Davidson College this year on
their first trip to America. Erich

en are entering Davidson next
Wednesday to spehd a year in this
country studying.

Deichgraeber, a native of south-
ern Denmark, is 19 years old and
is studying a pre-med course. Spon-

ternity, Erich is in his 14th year
of schooling.

Pertti Karkkainen is a recent ad-
dition to the special student roll,
replacing Alfred Wang of Hong
Kong. He is from: Finland, is 21
years old, and is also planning to
study a pre-med course. Incidental-
ly, he is a member of the Finnish
Naval Reserve.

Both special students will enroll
in upper class courses.

FACULTY, FRESHMEN
BARBEQUE PLANNED

In an effort to go one step fur-
ther than the Saturday night fresh-
man-faculty reception, Davidson
has scheduled a faculty-freshman
barbeque for Monday night. Sep-
tember 13 at. 6 p. m., on the South
terrace of the College Union.

The barbeque, served on the ter-
race and devoured under the trees
on the Union lawn, will serve as an
icé breaker between the new stu-
dents and their older friends. It
will come as a welcome break to
the gruelling days of testing, men-
tal and physical, for the freshmen.

In case of rain, the barbeque will
be served indoors at the Union.

Cut cards are no more. The fa-
mous, fabulous weekly missles
from the Dean's office are gone
for good, reptaced by a more ef-
ficient, less troublesome system,
Dean Spencer has announced.

The new system will leave stu-
dent cuts up to the student. Each
man will be responsible for his
own attendance at classes, and will
receive no notice of cuts until he
has stepped over the line into the
overcut realm.

Dean Spencer says that the cut
books wil! be complete each Wed-
nesday afternoon through the pre-
vious Sunday, and that any 8tu-
dents who wish to consult them
may do so on that afternoon and
on Thursday afternoon between the
hours of 2 and 4:30 p. m. Juanita

son Orientation will continue un-

til the Thanksgiving Holidays be- |
gin in late November. Separate

chapel programs followed by coun-

seling sessions will be the order of

the day for the frosh twice each

week for the next two months.

Other major changes that have
entered the program include the
naming of themes for each day of
orientation. This was done, accord-
ing to Spencer, in order that the
freshmen might at least read some
order into the rather mixed-up
time that they will endure for the
next few days.

The freshman-Queens dance orig-
inally scheduled for Saturday night
has also been postponed. Queens
has not yet started Orientation, but
will sponsor a dance next Saturday
night for the Davidson frosh, who
by that time should be weighted
down with the knowledge of four
days of classes.

In describing the continuation
plan for Orientation Dr. Spencer
indicated that this year’s plan will
be experimental, subject to loop-
holes and changes, but that it ba-
sically will center around a plan of
giving the freshmen a long-range,
deeper conception of Davidson and
college life than has been given in
the past.

There will be a Monday and a
Wednesday series of Chapel pro-
grams giver. exclusively for fresh-
men until Thanksgiving, Monday
chapel programs being held by fac-
.ulty counselors at chapel time in
their classrooms, Wednesday chap-
els for the whole class in the ball-
room of the Union.

Monday sessions will be under
the direction of Jay Ostwalt, and
will be devoted to getting the fresh-
men orientated to study habits of
college. Discussions will be held on
such subjects as budgeting time,
preparations for reviews and ex-
ams, noie- taking, t term papers, and
conditions for méntal health.

The Wednesday sessions will cen-
ter around more universal themes
such as student government, the
honor system, the why of drinking
regulations, reading, student ser-
vices, and activities.

The period extending from this
morning through Tuesday night
will be filled with testing, lectures,
and introductory periods to the
college, its student body mores,
and its administration and faculty.
Highlights will be the reception
and movie Saturday night, and the
Sunday worship services and visits
to faculty homes.

Monday night’s barbeque, given
in an effort to introduce the fresh-
men in some permanent way to the
faculty and administration, will be
followed on Tuesday night by a
freshman pep meeting and another
movie. Classes will begin Wednes-
day morning for all Davidson stu-
dents.

CUT CARDS SUCCUMB;
NEW SYSTEM BEGINS

care of all cases, her headquarters
being officially named the ‘cut
room’,

To increase assurance of atten-
tion and to lessen the burden which
would in ordinary cases weigh
down the job of attending to all
cases in the hours indicated above,
students who have complaints af-
ter having consulted the cut books
are requested to fill out cards pro-
vided. Their cases may then be
cleared throughout the following
days.

Dean Spencer indicated upon
consultation that the new system is
experimental at the moment, and
that though he feels that it will be
a decided improvement over the
previous system, it is still open to
criticism and suggestions. Students
are asked to present any improve-
ments they have for consideration.
