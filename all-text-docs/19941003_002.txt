MONDAY, OCTOBER 3, 1994

Students looking with a keen

eye in the library the first couple of

weeks during the semester may
have noticed that a new type of
directory was on display. The di-
rectory included every students
social security number, which
alarmed some students.

The information was on dis-
-play for anyone who walked into
the library. RLO Director Richard
Terry says, “The directories were
given to administrative staff people

Privacy vs. ‘Practicality
Student social security (or ID) numbers available to public

who might need the social security
numbers.”

Terry expressed his regret that
the directory was out in the open
and quickly had the directory re-
moved from the library. Assistant
Dean of Students Leslie Marsicano
said she thought that it had “been
clear about how to use these direc-
tories when they have been given
out.”

Why the change?

Davidson College switched the
student ID numbers from random

gram, Banner.. Controller Ed
Kania says the switch “puts us-in
alignment with the rest of the world
in terms of transmitting informa-
tion back and forth.”

The new ID number gives
Davidson easier access to admis-
sions records, allows the school to
be more effective in distributing
financial aid packages, and facili-
tates access to information on pay-
ment plans. Kania explains that
getting this information before the
change occurred was “a cumber-

some and manual process.”
Concerns about the Switch

Senior Thad Reece praises the
positive aspects of the system; how-
ever, he complains that “the social
security numbers are written like
social security numbers on the
card,”

Marsicano says “the change
had to be made quickly to not delay
registration for the students, which
meant the college did not -have
time to redesign the ID cards.”

Concerns about privacy rights
have risen through this issue. The
Family Rights and Privacy Act of
1974 states that social security

numbers cannot not be released
with normal information about
people, such as names and ad-
dresses. Some students are un-
comfortable knowing that their
social security. number is on their I.
card. Others, like senior Sean
Callahan, say,“It does not bother
me. It is easier to remember.”

Marsicano says the college
will soon be able to change the face
of the ID cards so that the numbers
are not displayed in the normal
social security format. Once able,
the college will replace current
cards with the new cards upon re-
quest.

SGA Honor Code review committee meets

By Meg Wolff
Amidst recent student and fac-

~ ulty enthusiasm, the SGA ad hoc

committee to review the honor sys-
tem met Thursday. With represen-
tatives from the SGA, the Honor
Council, and fromthe student body,
the committee discussed strategies
for generating school-wide discus-
sion about the Honor Code.

Committee chair Warren
Buford, along with Honor Council
Chair Arthur Gaston, emphasized
the purpose of the committee: “We
are not out to create a problem with
the Honor Code; our purpose is
instead to generate discussion on
its effectiveness, its merits as well
as its shortcomings as perceived
by the college community.”

With an initial goal of “infor-
mation gathering,” the committee
hopes to hold informal discussions
on the honor code within social

organizations, possibly organizing
a school-wide panel discussion.

Students are encouraged to speak
to members of the committee.
