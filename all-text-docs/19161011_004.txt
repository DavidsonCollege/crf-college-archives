ANNUALS HAVE ARRIVED.

After a delay of six months, ove:
which the management iad no control,
the Davidson College Annual, “Quips
and Cranks,” edited by the class of ‘16,

-has been received and distributed.

The Annual as regards literary pro-
ductiveness is worthy of high praise.
The art work is unique and shows much
originality. ‘The photography was well!
done. However, there is an outstanding
objection, in that the engraving is
greatly defective.

The volume is dedicated in, well-
rounded phrasing to “The man, Wood-
row Wilson, who, as President of our
country, is every day justifying our faith
in him and our loyalty to him by his in-
defatigable labors and Christian states-
manship. . . . We honor him as the
champion of the right; we follow him as
a leader chosen of God; we love him as
our brother.”

As a history of the college year and.
especially of the class of '16, it ap-
proaches exactness, thoroness and com-
pleteness. The literary productions are
witty and are full of humor thruout.
The number of art contributions are
many and portray a great sense of wit
and college spirit. Notwithstanding
the fact of the failure of, the engravers.
the Annual is unique, and well above
the standard. It reflects great honor
upon the literary and artistic tastes of
the editors. '

He—How do you like my mustache?

She—Not so very, well at first sight.

He—Perhaps it will grow on you.

She—Oh, James, you are always
thinking of the most ridiculous things.
