JUNIOR SPEAKING
COMMITTEES ARE
CHOSEN BY CLASS

Program Commences With Ora-
toricals on Thursday Night

MARCH 21-23

Long-Delayed “Junior Follies”
Will be Prescribed on Saturday
: Night

Junior Speaking will be held, as pre-
viously announced, on the week-end of
March 23, with a full program now be-
ing arranged by committees appointed
last week.

As announced in this paper
weeks ago the date was changed from
March 16 to March 23 owing to a trip
being made by the Glee Club and or-
chestra on the former date. One month
after Senior Week-end the Juniors
will hold forth in their annual frolic.

The committees appointed last week
by Murray Christian, chairman of
Junior Speaking, are named as _fol-
lows: .“Davidsonian” Committee, C. M.
Pratt, chairman; F. D. Miller, V. A.
Milton, and R. F. Jarratt; Committee
on Oratoricals, C. R. Pritchett, chair-
man; E. E. Marsh, and H. W. White;
Entertainment Committee, R. B. Erck-
man, chairman; L. A. Mills, W. R. Hill,
and W. H. Best. These committees to-
gether with W. B. McGuire, manager
of the Junior Follies, will have full
charge of the week-end entertainments.

The program for the entire Junior
Speaking will then, probably, begin
with the Oratoricals on Thursday night.
This is held open to Juniors only, in
the form of a contest for the best
speakers in the class. The oratoricals
will open the week-end festivities and
entertainment will be furnished from
the night of March 21 until Saturday
night, March 23, by the Class of 1930.

Friday night in Shearer Hall the
Dramatic Club of Davidson College
will present a play. The title of this
play has not been decided upon as yet

Christianity.” dec!ared

Rule, Professor of
and in
logical Seminary, at Y Vespers Sunday

evening.

Apologetics Theo-

Basing his message on the ninth
chapter of Isaiah, the speaker pro-
ceeded to show how part of the

prophecy contained in the passage has
heen fulfilled and how other portions
are now being fulfilled. Drawing from
his experiences and study during ex-
tensive travel in Europe and the Orient,
Dr. Rule sketched the religious situa-
tions prevailing in the leading coun-
tries of the world.

China, the land of unrest and turmoil,
was first considered. In this land, lit-
tle understood by the western mind,
there is a transition from the old vil-
lage system of economy to the mod-
ern industrial system, and confusion
is to be expected. “God help the world
if she turns all her potential human
and material resources toward the goal

of imperialism; only the power of
Christianity. can prevent her taking
such a course.”

Likewise in America, the great

struggle is between the forces of secu-
larism and Christianity. The belief
that science is a philosophy rather
than a policy is one that must be op-
posed. Our military leaders and poli-
ticians have failed to secure peace;
only the Spirit of Jesus Christ remains
to transform this nation and others.
Otherwise they cannot be trusted with
the stupendous powers on the point
of being released by science.

In Europe and the rest of the world,
it is a “bonnie fight;” first one side
seems to be winning, then the other.
It is indeed a fight sufficient to chal-
lenge the best that is in any man,
whether he be called to answer that
challenge in the ministry or in digging
ditches, Se

Wildkittens Return
From Extended Trip
With Fair Results

Two One Point Losses Sustained
By Kittens in Six Games

On this week's trip of six games,
the Davidson Fresh won two and lost
four games. However, two of these
four losses were by one point margins
and the others were lost only after a
hard fight.

The Wildkittens began this series of
games with a defeat at the hands of
the Oak Ridge cadets. Although this
was the second victory for the cadets
in a row, the Fresh put up a plausible
fight. Captain Hutaff and Mathis did
good work, tying for high score with
7 points each. The final score was Oak
Ridge 40, Davidson Fresh 28.

The next contest was a second game
with V. P. I. rats and the Kittens again
downed them by a score of 35 to 24.
The whole team put up a good game
but Milton starred as high scorer with
14 points.

The V. M. I. Freshmen were victors
by a one point margin, 34 to 33 in
the next game of the trip. Hutaff
and Mathis were undqubtedly out-
standing in this game with 12 and 15
points, respectively.

It now seems that Dame Luck was
against the Fresh and a second suc-
cessive one point defeat was suffered
at the hands of the strong W. & L.
Freshman outfit. The final score was
39 to 38. Captain Hutaff again showed
up well with a high score of 11 points.
Martin also played a good game, run-
ning Hutaff a close second for high
score with 10 points to his credit.

A third close game was lost by the
Kittens when the University of Vir-
ginia first yearmen handed them a de-
feat to the tune of 27 to 22. Milton
and Mathis played a good game for
the Fresh.

In the final game of the trip, tlie
Kittens won an easy victory over the
Lynchburg College Reserves—31 to 17.

Capt. Hutatf led the scoring attack
of his mates with a total of twelve
points.

FULL MOON WILL LEND
GLAMOUR ‘TO WEEK-END

There's going to be weather whether
not, but from all information pro-
curable from the Weather Bureau; the
omens seem auspicious for fair and pro-

or

pitious weather over the senior week
end,
At any rate, come weal or woe, the

movement of the heavenly bodies has so
ordained that the moon will be in full
exactly on the night of Saturday, Feb
ruary the 23rd, and that is the date set
for senior dating.

Now the faculty committees still re-
main reticent on the style of the enter-
tainment. Some choose to interpret this
silence as the stillness before the storm.
Be that as it may, everything is in. sus-
pense, and suspence tends for excitement.

According to the most authentic rumors
abroad the seniors will feast with their
fair visitors at the hotel at a 6:00 o'clock
dinner. Then it is whispered that from
there they will proceed to the gymnasium
at 8:00 o'clock where—well it just can’t
be said what will happen theres. There
have been intimations that there will be ¢
squa—but the indefiniteness lends charm
to the affair.

MITCHELL COLLEGE
DRAMATIC PLAYERS
GIVE “THE RIVALS”

Play was Sponsored by Junior
Class

EXCELLENT ATTENDANCE

Fine Portrayals of Characters of
Eighteenth Century Comedy

Sponsored by the Junior Class, the
Mitchell College, Dramatic Club, of
Statesville, presented “The Rivals,” a
three-act comedy by Sheridan, — last
Friday night in Shearer Hall. A rather
large crowd the presenta-
tion, which was exceptionally well-done
for an all-girls cast.

The play, which was written in the
eighteenth century, was, however,
spicy and clever enough to hold the
interest of the audience. The central
story of the comedy dealt with the dif-
ficulties of the lovers, Lydia Languish
and Captain Jack Absolute. Absolute,
to gain the affection of Lydia who in
seeking an to
title and money, is known to her as
Ensign Beverly.

Lydia’s aunt and Absolute’s father
arrange a match between the two lov-

witnessed

romance has aversion

ers. Lydia hates Absolute when she
earns his identity, but she is finally
reconciled.

In the play as resented, the best

character portrayals were without
doubt that of Mrs. Malaprop, Lydia’s
aunt, who added much to the comedy
by the misuse she made of sesquipe-
and that of Bob Acres,
the ludicrous country gentleman. The
costuming of the characters was very
effective.

Seniors Make Selection

For Annual Class Gift

Final Decision of Class is for
Curtains for New Auditorium

At a meeting of the Senior Class
Wednesday, the committee appointed
to select a class gift of which Gardner
Green was chairman, submitted a re-
port, advocating the buying of cur-
tains for the stage of the new audi-
torium. The report was unanimously
accepted.

The curtains are to be of red velvet
with a black border. The committee
suggested that this gift would be espe-
cially appropriate as the class of ’29
will probably be the first class to
graduate in the new building. This
gift will be practical and useful as well
as attractive. It is planned to put
a bronze plate somewhere near the
curtains, stating that they are the
gift of the class of ’29.

Tom Hill, treasurer of the class, made
a report in which the financial status
Was given and announcement as to
the necessary assessment was approved
and adopted by the class.

Complete Wireless
Station Installed

Radio Club was
organized during the fall of 1928, un-
der the sponsorship of the Physics De-
partment of the school. The object
has been to promote an interest in
‘adio, and. wireless telegraphy among
the students.

The club has a complete wireless
station installed in the small brick
tructure behind the dormitories which
was formerly used as,a pumping sta-
tion. The call letters of the radio sta-
tion are w4ZD. The operators talk
with practically every state in the
Union, and many foreign countries.
They also have regular schedules with
some stations, one of these being
Greensboro, which communicates with
Davidson at 9:00 o’clock every morn-
ing. If any students desire to send
messages by this method the opera-
tors will be glad to accommodate
them—free of charge.

The role of Vance is played
by William Powell, who recently scored
a hit in the all-talking version of the
stage play, “Interference.” It is said that
Powell gives a brilliant performance as
the suave, calculating detective who pro-
ceeds to unravel one of the most baffling
murders ever confronted by the police.

Many consider “The Canary Murder
Case,” to be the most thrilling of the
Van Dine series, and those who have
seen and heard the picture, claim that
the screen version loses none of the dra-
matic intensity that characterized it in
book form.

Many well known names appear in the
supporting cast and include Jean Arthur,
Louise Brooks, James Hall, Gustay von
Sey ffertitz, Charles Lane and Louis Bar-
tels.

On the same program with “The Can-
ary Murder Case,” are a number of fea-
tures, headed by a Metro Movietone Re-
vue with a cost of seven Broadway stars
singing, dancing and telling jokes. A
Chorus Girl comedy “Skating Home” and
