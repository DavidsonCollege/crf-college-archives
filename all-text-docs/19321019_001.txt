Honorary Greek Letter Frater-
nity in America

Phi Beta Kappa is the oldest and largest
honorary Greek letter fraternity in America.
Starting at William and Mary College, Vir-
ginia, in 1776, it had soon established chap-
ters at Yale, Harvard, and Dartmouth dur-
ing the eighteenth century. Since then many
chapters have been added until now there
are over 100 chapters in the best institu-
tions of the United States and Canada, and
its enrollment has grown to sixty thousand

Although it started at William and Mar

as a social fraternity, it developed into. arm
honorary society as a reward for excellencdl

in scholarship. Its motto is “Philosophy, thd
Guide of Life.” Gamma Chapter of North
Carolina was chartered at Davidson in 1922,
at which time there were five faculty. mem-
bers who represented chapters of William
and Mary, Yale, University of Virginia, and
Harvard, Elections are held twice annually
in which the highest ranking members of the
Senior class are selected.

The date for the public address and fra-
ternity banquet has been set for Decem-
ber 5, 1932,

Paul Brown, president of the Y. M. C. A.,
