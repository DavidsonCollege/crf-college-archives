The return home

Le me tell you, no one on cam-
pus was more ready to get out of
here last weekend than I. After a
grueling week of studying, my
plans to visit a friend at another
school were looking pretty sweet.
My destination was Ohio Univer-
sity in Athens, Ohio. For those of
you who know nothing about O.U.,
it’s a state school of 15-20,000 that
just happens to have the biggest
Halloween party this side of the
Milky Way. And let me tell you, it
seemed like most of this galaxy’s
inhabitants were there.

Basically, the scene was some-
thing like this: 40,000 people,
including O.U. students, visiting
students, locals, and various other
freaks of the industry dressed up in
the most outrageous costumes they
could find and congregated in three
blocks of Main Street Athens.
Well, to say the least, I didn’t need
a fish costume to feel like a sar-
dine. To say the most, I have never
seen a bigger, badder, crazier party
in my waking existence. It was
awesome! :

The rest of the trip was won-
derful and very relaxing. How-
ever, the more of the school I saw,

. the more I appreciated why I came
to Davidson inthe first place. Sure,
everybody knows that Davidson
takes some getting used to. It’s not
always the most fun or exciting
place to be. Nor would anyone
accuse this school of being stress-
free or easy. Often times it can be
very trying on a student’s will
power and sense of dedication. At
least in my case, wondering if this
was the right school for me.

But after seeing a bigger state

_university, I was thoroughly con-
vinced I had made the right deci-
sion. Never ever would I trade the
social life, diversity, and size for
the many things that make
Davidson so special. Things like
the short walk to class (yes, even if
you are down the hill). Or seeing
the friendly smile of someone you
know around every corner. Or
teachers who I can have a mean-
ingful chat with and classrooms
where I can see the chalkboard
without a telescope. Or even the
“homey” feeling of knowing that
you’re part of a community and
not just a social security number.
You know what I mean. It’s all
those little things we take for
granted while not realizing how
vital they are to what we call the
“Davidson Experience.”

No one would deny that it’s a
wise move to get out and see what

other people and places have to’

offer. Getting another perspective
on life is always a step in the right
direction towards broadening your
horizons. You may even gain a
stronger appreciation and enthusi-
asm for the current perspective
you’relivingin. As inmy case, not
having something may be the best
way to realize what you actually
do have. Itso often seems like our
greatest blessings are those we
don’teven recognize being blessed
with. So, I guess what I’m trying
to say is, for me, the return home
is always the best part of going
away.

Mission accomplished: The Commons cares

Wau, I never would have be-
lieved it, but look forward to a
revised and improved menu over
the next few weeks. There was a
very good response to my last ar-
ticle both from students and the
directors.of the Commons.

I had a meeting with Carl
Pritchard, Dee Phillips, and Bar-
bara Metzler (the people who run
the Commons) the Wednesday
before last. I obviously had the
wrong impression of how willing
they were to listen to students.

Not only did they listen to
everything I had to say, but they
also said they would implement
almost every one of the sugges-
tions in my article. :

Things to look forward to in
the Commons:
1. Fresh fruit (not only apples) at
every meal.
2. Reduced fat content and grease
in most of the dishes (especially a
reduction in butter in the veg-
etables).
3. A wider variety of vegetables
that are fresher and not overcooked.
4. An attempt to make sure that at
every meal there is one entree that
is a lower fat, generally healthier
éntree (eg. if you just don’t feel
like meat loaf and gravy for lunch
you can get the grilled chicken).
5. Increased presentability of the
dishes (if it doesn’t look like it was
cooked right, you won’t see it).

6. A suggestion box.
7. Different fruit juices at the meals.
8. Special Freshmen hall dinners

- with the nutritionist to acquaint

Freshmen to nutrition and help
them make the right decision when
they get their food.

9. More variety in the Alternative
Bar.

Ihope there aren’t people out
their getting scared that they will
lose their fried chicken, Salisbury
steak, or french fries. They will
still be there. Except now you will
have a choice.

You’ ve probably seen most of
these changes already and you
should see the rest of them in the
next few weeks. Also make sure

‘that you keep checking the salad
_bar. That is going to be one of the

places where some of this new
stuff will go.

All’this proved to me that the
people in the Commons do really
care what the students think, and
they encourage input from the stu-
dents. So, if you have a concern,
they would love for you to voice it.

Thanks to everyone whocalled
me or voiced their concerns them-
selves. And thanks to the Com-
mons for being so receptive to stu-
dent input and really caring about
the students. I guess it proves the
saying, “If you want something, it
never hurts to ask.”

Control and immortality

I, the film Interview with the Vam-
pire, the undead Louis attempts to
convey the void in his life to the
interviewer in all its tragic blood-
lessness, andhe fails. All the inter-
viewer can see is the fantastic as-
pects—the enhanced senses, the
pallid beauty, and most impor-
tantly, the immortality. .

What would it be like to live
forever? Man has always been
fascinated by the mystery of life,
and as with most mysteries, has
tried to solve it. From the mythical
Prometheus to Mary Shelley’s
modern Prometeus to the genetic

engineering of today, the scientific
world has aspired to create and
control life, with little success.
Sure, test tube babies show that life
can develop outside of the womb,
but the basic ingredients are still
necessary. Sure, intraveneous drips
and electric breathing machines
can prolong the life of a comatose
patient, but if the elemental spark
of life exits, there is no machine
that can put it back.

Yet, mandesirescontrol. Point _

a gun at another human being and
you control his future. Have an
abortion and you exercise control

over the being inside you. Live as
a.vampire and feel the power thatit
gives you over mortals.

. This longing for control is
what allures the interviewer; it is
what motivates scientists to con-
tinue their research; it is what in-
cites one man to point a gun at a
deer, or at another man.

Will this control ever be at-
tained? Will the elemental spark
of life ever shine for us to see and
analyze? I do not have the answer
to that question—but I wonder, ifit
is discovered, will we wish it had
remained a mystery?

We must support the commitment to academic excellence.

success on standardized tests, from
the LSAT’s to the MEDCAT’s.
Finally, and perhaps most impor-
tantly, a challenging educational
experience instills confidence and
reinforces asound work ethic. Sin-
gularly, the most heard compli-
ment from returning Davidson
alumni is their appreciation for the
demanding Davidson undergradu-
ate experience.

Second, students and faculty
must realize that the “free-riding”
issue can erode, over time, the rigor
of the Davidson experience. For
this reason, we need to support,
institutionally, the commitment to

academic excellence. A proposal
to place the mean letter grade of a
course next to the student’s grade
on a transcript (similar to the

Dartmouth approach) will reduce:

the incentive to seek courses based
on an expected grade.

Moreover, the relative perfor-
mance of a student within a course
will provide much more informa-

tion to students themselves, em-

ployers, and graduate schools than
does our current transcript. Medi-
cal school grade reports almost
always show a student’s relative
performance in the class, provid-
ing a clearer appraisal of the
student’s performance.

Finally, the faculty and the

administration need to continue to

- support younger faculty in their

effort to offer challenging courses.
Younger faculty need to know that
their rigor is both expected and
applauded.

Parents appropriately ask what
their Davidson tuition buys. We
need to respond in a clear voice
that it buys the opportunity to learn
and to earn the credibility of a
Davidson degree.

The public good case shows
the need for continued vigilance to
protect the college’s standards. If
we compromise the credibility of
the graduate diploma, Davidson
may no longer be an experience
that justifies the cost.

Anybody can
be famous

Binisce can get famous these
days. It’s gotten so easy. All you
have to do is try to kill someone —
you don’t even have to go through
with it, as long as you act crazy
enough. How about that one guy
who shot inside the White House a
few weeks ago. I forgot his name,
but he’s totally famous now just
because he shot a few bullets. Big
deal. Then you have that mother
whokilledhertwochildren. Yawn.
Anybody can kill her own kids —
nochallenge there. I mean, all of a

_ sudden she’s so famous that the

whole world knows about her.
She’s been on the news every day,
the front page of USA Today, the
topic of talk shows — you name it.
She went from your average mom
tocelebrity status injusttwo weeks
for barely doing anything.

Remember the good old days
when you had to actually earn your
celebrity status? Like that guy
who shot John Lennon — oh,
what’s his name — anyway, he
deserves to be as famous as he is.
What he did took courage and guts.
I mean, that’s what being famous
is all about isn’t,it — having more
guts than normal people? Afterall,
the: guy who shot Lennon didn’t
just kill anybody. This guy shot
one of the greatest musicians of all
time. And it wasn’t one of these
phony jobs where you just shoot a
gunatan empty White House when
the President was nowhere near —
that’s wussy stuff.

The guy who killed Lennon
set his goal from the beginning,
and he carried out his plan like a
genius. Now, he worked hard. I
mean, this guy had a work ethic
that I would want my kids to know
about. He’s the type who deserves
to be on Oprah. He’s the guy who
deserves to be on the cover of USA
Today with all of the important
famous people — not these damn
phonies that don’t do anything.
Because that’s all that psycho
mother who killed her kids is —
she’s just a big phony. And USA
Today and Oprah — they’re pho-
nies, too, for making people like
her become so famous. Will some-
body please tell me what in the hell
this world is coming to?
