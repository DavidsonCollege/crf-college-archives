BOXING TOURNEY
IS SUCCESS

Around the Wildcat’s Lair

SPRING SPORTS
BEGIN

Punches, jabs, slaps, slugs, they were
‘all seen in abundance during the in-
tramural boxing tournament, which
culminated in the college gymnasium

Monday night. There was some real
pugilistic talent revealed in the course
of this tourney. Those men who won
out in the final rounds could represent
ye old Davidson in the ring most
worthily if boxing should be put into
the intercollegiate sports program.
The way that Frazier boy handles
himself behind the gloves is a sight
to behold. He has excellent footwork,
a nice defense, and those fists fly fast
and true. Quite a few other good
fighters showed promising traits along
this line also.

Spring football has ended with
everybody very optimistically longing
for the regular season to open this fall,
but Coach Laird is going to have
something to hold our attention for the
remainder of this school year with his
baseball proteges. The pitching staff
has been slightly hurt by the gradua-
tion of George Bailey and Charlie
Pearce, two southpaw twirlers from
last year’s state champs, but the red-
headed mentor still has some excellent
batterymen, who can very well carry
on this season. Five gaps are left in
the field positions, but there are also
some very promising candidates for
these places. Mr. Laird, we are hop-
ing for you and Davidson an undis-
puted diamond title in the Big Five
race this spring.

Track prospects look unusually
pleasing as we see them so far. Some
events are lacking in strength, but with
Ras Evans and Mokey Faison on hand
to succeed Fred Fleagle in the cen-
tury, the added strength of Earle Fra-
zier in the distances, and Captain Mil-
ler Cochran sticking to his form in the
weights, the ’Cats should: hold up
superbly under their rather difficult
schedule. '

The racquet wielders are warming
up these days with the hopes of put-
ting on the courts one of the best
teams ever to represent Davidson in
this sport. Jimmy Halverstadt, who
lost to Wilmer Hines in the finals of
the state play of last spring, is captain
of the tennis team this year, and such
men as Johnny Lafferty, Tee and Wee
Thompson, Dudley Elvery, Francis
Scott, Carlyle Lewis, and Martin Bar-
nett are other candidates.

This erratic game of basketball
probably saw its most ironical of all
tournaments ever staged, when this
past week-end the Southern Confer-
ence teams competed in our state’s
capital city. Only two games, U. N. C.’s
defeat of Virginia and Duke’s victory
over V. M. I., went in accord with the
dope sheets. N. C. State’s surprising
upset of the Gamecocks from South
Carolina was the first shock of the
tourney, but when W, & L. came
through to trounce the Wolves and
Duke in turn licked Bo Shepherd's
Tar Heels, who had defeated the Blue
Devils twice during the regular sea-
son, everybody thought it was high
time for some orthodox wins. There
still awaited, however, the one-point
triumph’ of W. & L. over the Dukes
in the finals, This marked the second
time in two succeeding sport cards that
the Durham school has been in sight
of Utopia, so to speak, but the gods
wouldn’t concede them the necessary
margin. Last fall it was the Georgia
Tech Yellow Jackets, and this time

Coaches Pleased By
Football Prospects

A fair outlook for next year’s foot-
ball edition of Wildcats was forecast
by Coach “Doc” Newton as he ‘re-
viewed spring training with an eye
toward prospects, The Wildcats in
1934 will face a trio of much-strength-
ened foes, Carolina, State and Wake
Forest, and the still powerful Blue
Devil. Also on the ’Cat schedule is
a little college called West Point.

The Davidson football machine, 1934
model, although having the same gen-
eral lines of its immediate predecessor,
will be a little stronger defensively if
Newton’s prediction runs true to form.
Much is expected of the Mackorell-
Wingfield passing combination, and of
Hutchins, candidate for blocking suc-
cessor to Eb Willson.

In the backfield with the regulars,
Mackorell, Wingfield and Hutchins, are
a trio of good backs in Yarborough,
Verble and Pittman. Spring training
also showed Slaughter, Pearce and
Bumgarner as deserving mention.

In the line, the position of center
is possibly the most doubtful. The
graduation of McElrath and West will
leave the center slightly void, although
a number of candidates, Lee, Batte,
Reid, Purdy, Gracey and Clark, may
well prove dynamite. The regular
guards, Fort, Potter and Hand, will
return next year, with Johnson, Mc-
Clung and Brewer as reserve watch-
men,

Siewers and Cathey, lettermen, will
again be at tackle next year, with
Armfield, Johnston and Patterson in
reserve. The end question is ably an-
swered by the regulars, Morgan and
Windham, and the reserves, Newton,
Burns and Richardson.

Viewed as a whole, stated Newton,
the team will be well-balanced with
a larger than usual number of’reserves.
The question is will it be able to com-
pare with the “big town” organiza-

tions that the- aemye have recently
acquired. /

Shirey Wins Honors
In Gym Competition

The Gymnastic Competition Medal,
given to the best gymnast in school,
was won this year by Luther Shirey.
Lorenzo McPhail was second; Law-
rence Quarterman, third, and Hugh
Wilson, fourth.

Shirey totalled 207 points to win.
He was followed closely by McPhail,

who scored 205 points. Quarterman
made 192 points, and Wilson 183
points,

The competition extended over a pe-
riod of several days and was conducted
by Lacy Adcox, who won the competi-
tion last year. Forty-five men partici-
pated in the event. Officials expressed
themselves as being well pleased with
the contest and the large number who
had taken part in» it.

The scores of all the men have not
yet been tabulated. These scores will
be announced next week and at the
same time it will be announced which
class scored the highest number of
points. The winning class will receive
points which will count towards the
cup for intramural sports.

Many Thousand
Votes Are Cast

Selection

MACKORELL IN FIVE

Weathers Is First Man Ever to
Repeat

The third annual Flaming Five con-
test, sponsored by the Charlotte Ob-
server, was brought to a close last
week as thousands of sports fans in
the two states chose the following men
as the five most outstanding in the
Carolina sports world during 1933:

Freddie Crawford, All - American
tackle of Duke.

George Barclay, University of North
Carolina guard, who made the second
All-American team.

Johnny Mackorell, Davidson quar-
terback, considered as one of the best
backfield men in the state.

Virgil Weathers, University of
North Carolina, once a member of the
All-Southern basketball team.

Clarence Stasavich, three-letter ath-
lete of Lenoir-Rhyne.

In three weeks of balloting, 15,000
votes were cast for 247 candidates, and
the margins between the first four
men were slight, Crawford having a

total of 1,062 votes; Barclay, 1,016;|-

Mackorell, 987, and Weathers, 945,
Stasavich received 569.
Weathers is the first man ever to

Large Squad Reports
For Varsity Baseball

In the spring the young man’s
fancy lightly turns to thought of—
baseball. And so it was last Monday
when the varsity baseball candidates
held their first practice of the year.

Prophesying what the Davidson nine
will do this year is as difficult as keep-
ing tab on the weather. Eight of last
year’s Big Five champion nine were
lost.by graduation and paralysis kept
“Shrimp” Morris, captain-elect and
first baseman, from returning.

With such severe losses, how Coach
Laird will line up his team is unknown.
The loss of Pierce, star left-hander,
leaves Davidson with no dependable
portside hurler. Harris, star right-
hander, will probably see much service
this year, and from West, Becker,
Coble, Richardson and Jenkins must
come the rest of the pitching staff.

Of the catchers, probably Ravenel
and Wingfield will see the most servy-
ice, with possibilities in Burns and
Moore. The outfield may be relied on
this year, Rogers and Weeks of last
year’s squad being aided by members
of last year’s freshman team.

The infield line-up at present is a
toss-up, the sophomores will probably
land some position there. Mackorell,
who has played second base and who
last year was shifted to third, will see
service, and Smyre, utility man, may
get some position,

The team will not be as strong in
any department as it was last year,
but there is the chance that it may
develop. It will play four games with
every Big Five opponent except Caro-
lina, playing three games with her.
The games will run in series of two
this year, each team visiting for a
series of two and receiving for two
games.

The Wildcats will meet their first
opponent, Michigan State, on March
27. All other gamés will be played
in the Big Five.

Nine Davidson Track

Men To Enter Meet

The Southern Conference indoor
track meet will be held next Saturday
night on the indoor track of the Uni-
versity of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill. Although the meet is primarily
for conference schools, several events
will be open to men from any college.

Nine men will represent Davidson in
this competition. Evans, Parker, and
Faison will run in the sprints; Frazier,
Gullette, and Oakes in the 880-yard
run, and Pratt and McPhail in the high
hurdles. Morrow, scheduled to com-
pete in the 880-yard run, has been laid
up with a cold, and it is not certain
whether he will recover in time to
make the trip.

Other non-conference schools enter-
ing the meet are Georgetown Univer-
sity, William and Mary College, Uni-
versity of Richmond, Catholic Uniyer-
sity at Washington, and possibly
others,

Four Varsity Letters
Awarded in Wrestling

In an announcement made public
Monday, Doc Unger, wrestling coach
at Davidson, revealed the names of
varsity wrestlers who are eligible for
the “D” in that sport. Those who will
receive letters, pending action of the
Athletic Council, are Captain Charlie
Forte, Jim Harris, Lawrence Quarter-
man, and June Blackwelder.

In spite of the fact that the Wildcat
matmen failed to win a single meet,
these men were outstanding on the
team and won one or more of their
matches.

Initiating the season this year, the
local wrestlers had meets with Wash-
ington and Lee in Lexington, Va.;
V..M. I. in the same city, and V. P, I.
at Blacksburg, Va. Later a match was
held with Duke University at Durham,
A match with the N. C. State grap-
plers was called off. In an exciting
match in the Davidson gymnasium,
Carolina outpointed the local boys in
their last match of the season, on Feb-
ruary 16..
