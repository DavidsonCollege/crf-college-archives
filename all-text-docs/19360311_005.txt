A LIGHT SMOKE

OF RICH, RIPE-BODIED TOBACCO

Over a period of years,
advances have been made in the selec-
tion and treatment of cigarette tobaccos
for Lucky Strike Cigarettes.

They include preliminary analyses of
the tobacco selected; use of center leaves;

the higher heat treatment of tobacco

certain basic

(‘Toasting’); consideration of acid-alka-
line balance, with consequent definite
improvement in flavor; and controlled uni-
formity in the finished product. All these
combine to produce a superior cigarette—
amodern cigarette, acigarette made ofrich,
ripe-bodied tobaccos— A Light Smoke.

Luckies are less acid

Recent chemical tests show* |! 2 : ° 5

that other popular brands
have an excess of acidity
over Lucky Strike of from

53%, to 100%.
