Gabriel's latest album breathes new life into old hits

By John Copenhaver

Peter Gabriel’s Secret World
Tour was, from what I have heard,
a magnificent show which
unsurprisingly is reflected in the
quality of his new live album taken
from the tour. His Secret World
Live album recorded in Modena,
Italy on November 16th and 17th,
1993, is a two-disc set containing
all of his big hits from the US
album such as “Steam,” “Digging
in the Dirt,” and “Blood of Eden.”
Also included on the album are his

big hits from SO such as “Red
Rain” and “In Your Eyes.”

Many times I’m tentative
aBout buying live albums for fear
of getting live songs that sound the
same or even worse than the origi-
nal album. Being a Peter Gabriel
fan, I bought the album on faith
and was not disappointed. Gabriel
reinterprets many of his songs and
makes some even longer than their
album counterparts. His song
“Steam” starts off with a soft ver-
sion of “Steam” called “Quiet

Steam” (From the “Digging in the
Dirt” single) and then bursts into
the original “Steam.”

The version of “Kiss That
Frog” is similar to the video ver-
sion mixed with Gabriel playing
the harmonica. “Digging in the
Dirt” starts off with some creative
percussion, making the song longer
and slightly harder. Finally, the
last song is an 11-minute “In Your
Eyes” taken to the extremes of
reinterpretation. It is filled with
different unusual back up vocals

Surreal McCoy's Rock Outpost

by Dave Williard

The Surreal McCoy’s, a new
Davidson band, played last Thurs-
day night at the Union Outpost’s
Jumpin’ Java Cafe. Seniors Tom >
Bavis and Jim Moss joined Char-
lotte residents Shannon Cantrell
and_ Shawn Lynch. for a mixed
acoustic and electric set. _

Their Davidson premier was
the band’s third live appearance,
and although they have been to-
gether for only four months, the
McCoys have already put out a
four song EP. Cantrell, the band’s
singer and song writer, leads the
group with brooding vocals.“I see
the ugly underbelly of things a lot
of the time,” Cantrell said.

"Blinded," a well produced
song on the EP, best demonstrates
‘the singer’ s introspective, stream-
of-consciousness style. “On Top

of the World,” a favorite at
Thursday’s gig, is also well writ-
ten. On this song, guitarist Shawn
Lynch plays reservedly and unself-
ishly, a testament both to his confi-
dence and his talent.

Bassist Jim Moss recently
joined the band, but he melds well
with Tom Bavis’s drumming style.

unique style. Their music is spar-
ing, but the mood is quite intense.
‘More collaborative song writing
will help develop the McCoys’ al-
ready mature set list.

The surreal McCoys are a tal-
ented band, and they deserve
Davidson’s attention. Good luck,
y'all!

Together they
help to push
Cantrell’s vocals
to the forefront, a
rare quality in
such a young
band. TheSurreal

and Vee discuss the pros and cons
of her work; she thinks he knows
she is a prostitute and he thinks she
is amath tutor. I couldn’t follow it
either. Fueling the action is a
mafia subplot which places Vee at
the center of an intra-mob theft

scandal started by her pimp.

The worst part of the entire
movie are the heinous stereotypes
of prostitutes and pimps. Vee’s
greasy Brooklyn-accented pimp
tells her “You’re not even a per-
son.” Well, I guess you have to
respect the effort. The movie ends

exactly as you knew it would—
Frank comes of age, Vee becomes
aperson, and Dad believes in love
again.

I have no clue at what audi-
ence this movie is targeted. Maybe
8-10 year old girls. One of Frank’s
friends was pretty cute.

This version of “In Your Eyes” is
fascinating, but a little long for
repeated listens. Also included on
the album is a live version of an
unusual song called “Across the
River,” which can be found in its
original form on the rare “Big
Time” single.

album. My only criticism is that
there is quite a bit of crowd inter-
ference in a lot of the songs. This
does not really affect the faster
songs, but the mood of the slower
songs is often broken by the clap-
ping of an overzealous crowd.
Even with the slight annoyance of
the crowd, I would highly recom-
mend this album to any Peter

Dear Terry Buffington,

"Someone who cares"

Dear Terry Buffington,

I wanted to ask you about a problem. Whenever I drink a lot,
which is not often (maybe once every two months), I lose some of my
memory. I have conversations with people that I don’t remember
later, and I go places I don’t remember going. This doesn’t seem to
happen to any of my friends. Are you a doctor? Can you give me
advice about this? I just want to have a good time and remember it
later.

Signed,
Anxious Alcoholic

Dear Anxious Alcoholic,

I’mno doctor, but I know the dangers of binge drinking. Memory
loss is one of the scariest results of alcohol abuse, except for maybe
choking on your own vomit. Excess alcohol consumption gives your
id free reign over your actions, while your superego slumbers in the
corner. When that happens, you are likely to do things you may regret.

They say that blackouts are a sign of alcoholic tendencies, so
anyone who has them consistently needs to be very careful about
regulating their drinking. The obvious answer, and the one no one
really wants to hear, is this— don’t drink so much. But if you’ re going
to drink a lot, try another philosophy: pace yourself. By drinking more
slowly, you give your body time to process the alcohol. You will
achieve a steadier buzz that lasts throughout the night, and you won’t
lose control so easily.

You might also want to avoid lengthy participation in activities
‘designed around drinking. By not playing in drinking games, “hour
of power,” and shotgunning, you can have a little more control over
what you swallow. I know it’s hard avoid these temptations in the
throes of bacchalanian revelry, but it’s worth your while to revel and
remember. Party ballsssss, sort of.

Love, Terry
