A Sense Of Balance

Davidson prides itself in being a
strong liberal arts college with a
.stnall student. faculty ratio. Actually,
many classes, even several better
suited to discussion formats than lec
ture formats, often contain 40 to 50
or even more students.

This is compounded by the fact that
>approximately one fourth ofthe pro-
fessors at this ‘strong liberal art
college’ are in the science depart
ments. This rther distasteful be-

department contains only three pro-
fessors, and if one goes on sabbatical
this leaves only two. (4) There is only
one professor for Drama and Speech.

That this could exist in a college
containing six departments with at
least six professors each-is especially
puzzling. These are: (1) The Chemistry

Third, student interest in departments

Moratorium Le tter-In

Reprinted from the Tulane

Wednesday’s morning demonstra-

essential aspect of the personality of
our times; We live in an age when we
must question our -politics.

No-Aetion
Reaction

For some reason, as yet undetected,
this year is so far desefving of un-
precedented awards for dullness.

Take, for instance, the Machis going
local. The typical response from upper-
classmen was ‘“‘So what?” And there
were days when such a move might
have brought about an emergency
meeting of the Board of Trustees to
consider it.

Or consider the student Senate. If
the things that have arisen as con-
flicts this year had appeared last
year, there would have been a con-
stitutional convention at the mini-
mum, and maybe even a military
take over by someone who cared
enough. But so far the Senate has
met only in name, and the significance
of its actions is about as great as
Spiro Agnew’s contribution to nation-
al politics.

So perhaps the 59th volume of THE
DAVIDSONIAN will report, in the
end, that the year ended, as it had
proceeded, not with a bang but a
whimper.

ties, new emotions, new involvements,
and they have ,expanded into social
movements protesting race relations,
poverty, and war. We have sat, pick-
eted, marched, hoped, ane prayed
for peace between all breeds of men
and this we have clearly conducted
with the underlying belief that the
pen will become mightier than the
sword. ‘

A spokesman-for a crowd often
clouds your own beliefs and leaves
you more dismayed than conyinced
by your involvements.

Americans ‘have not availed them-
selves of one of their most. effective
channels for protest, the Post Office.
If the majority of the public conveyed
their true convictions concerning the
Vietnam war at one time by writing
the President one letter a day for
one week, the commonwealth of our
concern for peace will be substantially
communicated without the fear that
the good will of our personal opinions
will be overlooked or lost in the words
of a spokesman for the crowd or of
our elected representatives.

The timetable for your protest is
to mail your letters dailybeginning
November 9 and continuing through
November 15.to Richard M. Nixon,
President of the United States, 1600
D. C. 20006.

President Nixon may never read
your letter as such but he will be in-
timately reminded of your convictions
for peace. We have a message to give
to President. Nixon. Let us united
in a common effort to express our be-
liefs--as_ Americans.

Hart Criticizes Reporting

Of Moratorium Inei

To the Editor:

Now, the article in the

Since I was one of the stu-
dents who were called into
Col, Foster's office concern-
ing our respective (Mora-
torium Day activities, I en-
joyed reading Norman
Cary’s fictionalized account
of the free speech crisis
within the ROTC department
(Letters, Oct. 24).

Mr. Cary’s ‘‘reliab!e
sources” say ‘‘that some of
these cadets (the three ident-
ified Moratorium partici-
pants) were called before
high authorities in the ROTC
department and advised not
to participate in such events
again.””

If induction is valid in this
case, Cary's assessment of
the _ three consultations is
utter nonsense. No threats,
no reprimands, and no criti-
cisms of the self-expression
transpired in my dialogue
with Col. Foster.

Col. Foster's Statements in
the same edition of the

, PAVIDSONIAN are a com-
“¢_pletely valid description of
my—discussion with him.

eae

same DAVIDSONIAN:
“Threat To M-Day Protest-
ors Denied.”’ I think that
it is impossible for a news-
Paper to objectify an event.
But let's; not go overboard.

First of all, I am not an
MS IV as the article states.
Simple facts are easy to
trace. I am a senior MS III
who spent his junior year
abroad,

Secondly, why was trouble
taken to question me about
the rumors and Col. Foster's
subsequent denial and then
not print my statement?

Perhaps is was because my
confirmation of Col. Foster's
denial was not compatible
with the present fad of de-
preciating ROTC and the
military. But this is only
speculation.

It is not speculation, how-
ever, that some DAVIDSON-
IAN readers would be less
likely to believe Col, Foster's
words if they were not con-
firmed in any way.’ Even
Beetle Bailey is a pathologi
cal liar

This letter has’ not investi-
gated how the pivotal fact
of my participation in the
‘Moratorium was discovered
by the ROTC department. I
cannot answer this question.
Whether the taking of names
constitutes in itself of re-
pression of self-expression is
debatable.

Possibly it is the use to
which such information is
put which is the variable
and determining factor. To
my knowledge the ROTC de-
partment has used the _ in-
formation for positive, con-
structive purposes only -.- -
i. e., advising me about: the
possible ramification of simi-
lar protest undertaken by
someone on active duty.

Would it not have been re-
prehensible for a professor
to have ‘noted with care those
students “who were absent
from his classes if the Mora-
torium_ had been voluntary?

to Mr. Hart's specific

er’s answer to a question re-
garding MS IV students. Se-
cond, Mr. Hart's comments
to the reporter were not
printed in the article because
(a) they*added nothing to
what had already been said
by Foster and every student
contact and (b) since THE
DAVIDSONIAN does not

It is with great pleasure that the “Column” is able
to bring to the eyes of the public a poem which has
remained hidden in the folders of Sam Ramachandran
since its first private reading, by the poet, in the spring

of 1969.

The poem bears a marked resemblance to its San-

Here, however, the situation is in
its usual flux.

Compared to a German University.
the SSS is really an easy system to
deal with. One can usually find out
the rules, discover where the rele-
vant papers are, get in touch with the
people in charge of one’s. case. But
here especially the foreign student
finds himself faced by an incredible,
formless mass. The student has_to
deal not with one administration but
with seven or eight, and it is im-

possible to get to the heart of the university structure.

The reason that one cannot find the central organ-
ization of a German university is that it does not have
one. There is a man called “the rector” who is sup-
posedly in charge, and I think he has an office with,
two secretaries somewhere, but all the substantive
decisions are made by the university’s six “faculties”.
The faculties, which are composed of the full pro-
fessors for specific groupings of subject matter, are
responsible for all hiring, scheduling and determin
ing of courses to be offeretl with content.

The purpose of this decentralization is to assure
the professors academic freedom, which it does to

some extent. But it

 - or rather “therefore” -

means that each individual professor has effectively
complete control of the content and timing of the
courses he offers. Result: the enormous majority of
courses ‘have titles like ‘Shamanism in Sibera’” or
“Selected Topics on the Physical Geography of the

Alps”.

if Norman Johnson were_a professor here and want-
ed to offer his course entitled “Obsolete Methods of
Shooting Airplanes with Tracers,” it would be no-
thing out of the ordinary.

This fragmentation has several unfortunate re
sults. The students in many cases naturally react in
favor of broader,. more topical courses, but in this
reaction many go too far. For instance, one ethnol-
ogy student told me about a course she had taken on
South American folk patterns. »

“But isn’t the course supposed to make you an ex-

out the poem like a quiet chant reverberating from the
walls of an ancient temple.

Mr. Ramachandran’s picture of famine is a modern
picture of India. So great is the influence of Barrenness
that the life-giving forces are not only rendered help-
less, but themselves play a part in the destruction.

pert in this field?” I asked. 3

“We were watching a film on weaving in Brazil,”
she said; “the professors want to talk about that but
not about the Indians being killed there right now.”

“Yes, it’s supposed to make you,an expert,” she
answered, a little sadly, “but I’m not one; you. can’t
become an expert here.” :

But since the responsibility also does not lie with
the tiny central administration, to whom must ‘ie
German student go for recourse against what he feels
to be inequitable?

A’ girl from Berlin who helped Rudi Dutschke, the
German SDS leader shot in the head last year, told
“me the answer to that question: ‘“‘We have to riot
to make the university react and give us something
to latch onto.” : :

At least to some extent she was right; the flexibil-
ity alluded to above results from a class last year
in which the students refused to allow the professor
to speak until he dealt with a more significant topic
(admittedly a deplorable tactic, but in this case ap-
parently necessary).

There are some advantages to the faculty system.
“In loco parentis” is only three words of Latin non-
sense to a German, and the professors do have aca-
demic freedom. But they get their freedom at the
expense of the students and in accepting such free-
dom they risk losing it to the students’ anger at de-
privation. “oe

So, Davidson students, be happy with your admin-
istration. At least when something goes wrong, like
area exams, one knows who to blame and where.to
find jhim
Which is an improvement over this anarchy. Isn't
