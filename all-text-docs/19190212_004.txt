J. E. Cousar Honored

Major Somerville Exercises Theologi-
ans In Undignified Manner.

Mr. James English Cousar, Jr., "14,
of Bishopville, S. C., is the winner this
year of the Moses D. Hoge Fellowship
of Post-Graduate study in Union ‘Theo-
logical Seminary, Richmond, Va. ‘This
is the highest distinction within the gift
of the Seminary to an undergraduate.
It is awarded annually to some member
of the Senior class on the ground of pre-
eminent merit, and secures for him the
privilege of a fourth year of special
study on salary. It is a fact of interest
that of the nineteen men who have won
this honor since the fellowship was es-
tablished about twenty years ago, ten
have been graduates of Davidson Col-
lege, namely: W. W. Arrowood, '03;
W. VT. ‘Thompson, Jr., ’05; R. K. ‘Pim-
mons, ‘og: Robert King, '06; J. K.
Parker, ’o8; W. C. Mcl.auchlin, °07;
B. R. Lacy, Jr, '06; H. 8. “Purner, "13;
Chas, L. King, "tg, and Jas. Ff. Cousar,
Jr. ‘14.

Since the demobilization began a num-
ber of former Davidsonians who have
been released from service in the army
and navy have returned to Union Semi-
nary, Richmond, and resumed — their
work in preparation for the ministry.
One of these is Maj. Walter G. Somer-
ville, ex-'16, a member of the Middle
class. One of the picturesque sights on
the Seminary campus every afternoon is
the long lines of students in open  for-
mation going through the vigorous set-
ting up exercises of the army under Ma-
jor Somerville’s direction.

Letter From Union.

Davidsuttiann Readers:

Greetings from Davidson’s sons at
Union. We are here twenty-nine strong
forming as you see about one-half the
student body,

It is almost like being back at David-
son, and when The Davidsonians arrive
—well—it reminds one very much of a
Wednesday afternoun.on the Hill.

We regret that we have not several
Davidson men who would be here in
normal times and our sorrow was great
when we heard that D. M. Orgain had
been called from this life, for we were
looking forward to having him Avith us.

Maj. W. G. Somerville and Sgt. O.
C. Williamson have come to us from the
army, and K. J. Foreman has come from
the navy. Major Somerville returns to
be with the Middlers and Williamson
and Foreman the Juniors.

We have all survived the “flu” and
are now enjoying “Billy” Sunday as he
preaches to thousands each day in the
City Auditorium.

Union is expecting great things from
Davidson and looks for a large number
of the Senior class to join us next year.
During the past two years, C. L. King,
in 1917-18, and J. E. Cousar, in 1918-
19, were awarded the Hoge Fellowship
entitling them to another year’s study
here,”

Several Davidson men have been here
attending the mid-winter course for ac-
tive ministers. In the regular classes of
the Seminary are: Hoge Fellow, Chas.
L. King. '14; Senior, F. M. Bain, ’14;
F. F, Baker, '13; M. A. Boggs, ’15; J.
F. Cousar, ‘14; A. R. Howland, '15;
Norman Johnson, 't5; W. A. Mcll-
waine, 15; D. McD. Monroe, 16; W.
C. Rourk, ex-'16; H. A. Scott, 16; J.
T. Williams, 16; D. C. Young, '15.

“Red” Nesbit Travels.

Licut. E. P. Nesbit, +7, writes from
overseas that he has recently been on a
visit to Nancy and Metz, and expects to
spend a week in Nice sodn.

“Red” was commissiyned in the Sec-
ond Officers’ ‘Training Camp at Fort
Oglethorpe, Ga., 1917. He went across
last summer, and of his part in the fight-
ing he says: “Our division saw five

weeks at the front and was there when’

the armistice was signed. We stayed in
our positions for a month and then mov-
ed back here (Monorville).”

WATCHING ‘THE RHINE,

The following is part of a letter re-
ceived on the campus from “Scrub” Hol-
landsworth, ex-’1y. “Serub” enlisted in
the Marines in December, 1917, and
has now been across the “big ditch”
nearly a year.

“Somewhere in Germany, Dec. 17,

“Tam glad you are back at Davidson,
and only wish [ could be there tonight,
but suppose [ must spend a few more
monthes on the Rhine.

“TE came across last March and have
been on the go ever since, We have had
some hard fights during the last  sum-
mer. It was not my privilege to do any
lighting, as | was transferred to the Sup-
ply Company right after. coming over.
We were by no means out of danger,
always a few kilometers behind — the
front lines, in good reach of the artillery.
And believe me, it always reached us,
too, Well, Tam glad those days are
over and all can go about with some ease.

“This trip over here has been a won-
derful experience for me and 1 would
not have missed it for anything. We
have sure made some kilometers and
most of them on foot. We crossed the
Rhine after hiking over three hundred
kilometers, crossing southern) Belgium,
Luxemburg, and a part of Germany.
We were on the road for: one month,
some days making as high as forty kilo-
meters, We passed over some fine coun-
try and some rough, lots of pretty scen-
ery. We crossed the Rhine, December
13, exactly one year to the date that I
joined the Marine Corps. The Ger-
mans seem glad to see us and cannot do
enough for us. We are in a remote
town out from the Rhine by name of
Artwied.

“Give my best regards to all the boys.

“Pvt. Charles J. Hollandsworth,

“Supply Co., 5th Marines, A..F.”

MAJOR SOMERVILLE.

The Davidsonian expects to print in
its Alumni columns in this and the next
several issues a brief biography of every
Davidson alumnus who has risen in the
service as high in position as captaincy.
These men deserve the mention and at-
tention of their fellow alumni and the
present student body. Davidson is not a
military institution, but she is justly
proud of her sons who have won hon-
ors in the army and on the field of bat-
tle.

W. G. Somerville, ex-'16, entered Da-
vidson a “Soph” in the fall of 1913. At
once he launched forth into class ath-
letics, the literary society, and other
phases of college activity. He became
known by everyone 4s “Summertime.”

Like the Greek minstrels of old, he
could always entertain a crowd with “a
line,” whether in the Eumenean Society
Hall, in front of Rumple, or by acting
“Billy” Sunday as a “pep” leader at a
football game. His enthusiasm lent a
big part in assuring the success of the
first Davidsonian and in giving the Y.
M. C. A. the needed driving power un-
der his presidency. It was with regret
to everyone that he left in the spring of
1916 to become State Bank Examiner.
The larger part of the student bedy ac-
companied him to the station and sent
him off with cheers, a manifestation of
the esteem in which he was held by his
fellows. ,

Somerville entered Union Seminary
in the fall of 1916, but later, at the open-
ing of our war with Germany enlisted
and went to the First Officers’ ‘Training
Camp at Fort Meyer, Va., from which
he was graduated August 15, 1917. His
first assiznment was with the 155th De-
pot Brigade, at Camp Lee, commanding
the 35th company. ‘This was followed
by being made adjutant of a colored
battalion.. He was made captain De-
cember 31, 1917,° and placed in) com-
mand of the 34th company. In March
he was sent to Fore Sill, Okla., for a
course in technical liaison (the .theory
and operation of all means of communi-
cation) and was returned to Camp Lee
as Instructor in the School of Arms.
When this school was discontinued in
July, 1918, Captain Somerville was re-
turned to his old company, the 34th, and
on September 18 he was promoted to the
rank. of major.

In October with thirteen other ma-
jors he was sent to a Machine Gun
School at Camp Hancock, Ga., and was
there when the armistice was signed.
He immediately applied fora discharge
and entered Union Seminary to continue
his theological course.
