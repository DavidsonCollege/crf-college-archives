The

By DEA NEKIUND

Davidson basketball has ta-
ken a roller coaster ride this
season, achieving momentary
successes unequaled in recent
memory only to fall back into
an error-prone, sluggish brand
of basketball which has resul-
ted in losses to less talented
teams.

Davidson senior Co-captain
Brian Coffey said of this
phenomenon, ‘‘The Furman,
Georgia Tech, and South Ca-
rolina games are maybe the
three biggest wins Davidson’s
had since I’ve been here, but
in between times we've lost to
teams I never thought this
team would lose to.”

One reason for the Cats
inconsistencies is the adjust-
ments that must be made
whenever a head coaching
change must be made in
midseason. Not only must the
team adjust to a new person-
ality but also to a new style of
play, because it is inevitable
that a new coach is going to
make some changes which he
believes will benefit the team.

Coffey explained, ‘‘Kochan
has made adjustments which
he thinks will help us and
some of his coaching philoso-
phies may be different than
Pritchett’s. We've slowed it
down a little more. We don't
fast break quite as much as
Pritchett wanted to, in that
case he’s (Kochan) trying to
stress a little more control on
offense and trying to stress a
little tougher defense.

Davidson lent itself to these
charges as co-captain Mark
Sumwalt noted, ‘‘Under
Coach Pritchett we had the
philosophy to.try and outscore
our opponent. We broke every
possible opportunity but we
just got to the point where we
couldn’t stop anybody. De-
fensively, we were giving up
over 90 points a game. Even-
tually it was going to have to
come where we were going to
have to stop breaking so much
and try to keep the score a
little bit lower. We couldn't
afford to go out and get beat
100-90.’’ ‘‘It looks good to
score 90 points but we were
still losing. I guess the best

ow

thing is to find some medium.
I hope we can do that before
the season ends, because we
tend sometimes now to get ‘to
the point where we’re too
conservative.”’

However, Davidson's de-
fense has still lacked intensity,
while the transition between
styles of play has as predicted
not been smooth. Coffey ex-
plained the adjustment in
styles of play, “It’s kind of
like getting to learn a little bit
of a new system and that’s the
reason for some of the incon-
sistency. Any time you start
with a new system, especially
in the middle of a season its
going to be really frustrating
because it will click sometimes
and sometimes it won’t. Tim-
ing isn’t down. You have to
adjust to both the new coach
and the new system he might
want to implement.”’

Offensivley, Davidson un-
der Kochan has shifted from
an offense centered on one
point guard (Chris Dodds) to a
two guard offense with Chris
and John Gerdy out front
which is designed to take some
pressure off Dodds. For the
most part the offensive strate-
gy has not changed dramati-
cally.

Coffey adds, ‘‘Basically he
(Kochan) wants to do the same
things. He’s trying to get
Gerd open to shoot the ball, to
let Chris have enough freedom
to do his thing and penetrate
and create plays like he can

do, and also to try to establish -

an inside game. These are
three priorities that we would
like to do. But he felt to do it
out, of a different set would
take some pressure off, would
eliminate some turnovers and
would help us out all around.”’
Two other factors contribu-
ting .to-Davidson’s inconsis-
tengy Coffey has attributed to
execution and confidence.
‘Weve had a little trouble
executing the way we should,
because maybe we haven't had
the confidence in the new
things of haven’t had the
confidence in ourselves at
times. Just a basic problem of
execution that happens to
anybody at anytime and could
have happened to us with

“Tire Wavidsonian

Pritchett, which it did once
and awhile.”

Coffey. also mentioned that
the complex defenses designed
to stop Gerdy and Dodds,
which the Cats have run up
against lately, have forced

Davidson to make additional
adjustments which have not
always been effective.

One aspect of Davidson's
play this year that both Coffey
and Sumwalt have been aware
of is that Davidson seems to
play better against the better
teams. Coffey interjected, ‘‘we
tend to play better against
teams we're a little afraid of.
We tend to play well against
teams we think can blow us
out or we’re afraid might beat
us bad...with other teams
maybe it’s just a tendencey to
play to the level of the
competition.”

In regard to the Cats’
season Coffey feels that, ‘‘con-

> tener gix.<. ey
oe — —_ ae

sidering everything that has
happened, we couldn’t help
but be pleased with, how the
season has gone, but looking
at it frustration rises because
we know that there are games

we could have won and shbuld

have won had we reached our
potential.”’

Sumwalt elaborated on the
question ot Davidson reaching
its potential, while considering
the season, ‘‘overall, I think
I'm a little disappointed be-
cause we haven't reached our
potential the way we could.
We've all seen us in certain
stretches in certain games
where we've looked like a real
good ball club. Teams have
had a lot of respect for us and
we turn around the next night
and don’t get the same type of
performance.”

“It’s nice to win more
games than we did last year,
but I think we’re a much

=m

Rollercoaster

better team. I don’t think
there’s any question there. I
don’t judge us by our relation
to last year’s team. I try to
judge us by our relation to our
potential, and we're still hav-
ing problems reaching that.’’

. In order for Davidson to put
everything together and reach
its potential, the team will
have to overcome its problems
with inconsistency, execution,
adjustments accompanying a
different playing style and
uninspired defense. Improve-
ment may be difficult, consi-
dering it must be against
perennial powerhouses such as
Notre Dame, Duke and Wake
Forest. But considering Da-
vidson’s previous record it
might just take this kind of
opposition for Davidson to
reach its potential.

Coffey comments on the
remainder of the season, ‘‘I
expect us to play really well at
times but probably to be
inconsistent at times because
its a young team. I think we’re
improving in a lot of ways. I
expect if we continue to try to
reach our potential as a team,
and if people can hang in there
and take the disappointments
and learn from them by the
end of the year we have the
chance to put it all together.”’

“If we get to the end of the
year, and in the Southern
Conference can come up with a
couple of those good games
then we'll be tough to beat by
anybody. But if we give up
and play one of our poor
games then someone will beat

Women struggle on road

By BILL PERKINS

The women’s Basketball
team won their only home
game this week against two
road losses over the weekend.
Their record is now 3-7.

Last Wednesday, the
Braves of Pembroke failed to
go on the warpath as they
were ambushed by the Lady
Wildcattes, 71-52, in the Coli-
seum.

Playing only 18 minute
halves instead of the usual 20
as a result of Pembroke’s late
arrival, the women showed
that they could play some
excellent basketball. Every-
thing went right as they hit 49
percent from the field for the
night.

Coach Susie Roberts praised
the performance, stating “‘it
was the best team effort all
year. They really put it toge-

ther: :
Scoring was even, as all five

Starters scored in double fig-
ures. Leading the Cattes was
Sally Bondurant with 16. Cin-
dy Morrison and Sarah Wo-
mack both chipped in 14,
Donna Ferren had 13, and

Beth Tanner managed 12.
On Friday the travel-weary

women faced Western Caro-

swine. the No 1 womens team in

- the state and fell victim ‘;. =
score of 92-44. Needless to

_,, Say, they probably enjoyed |

the snow more than the game.
High scorer was Womack with
16.

The next afternoon, they
faced M@érs. Hill in what

proved to be another disap-
pointing game. Mars Hill was .

victorious by a score of 83-68.
High scorer in the defeat was
Tanner with 22. Morrison had
14, while Bondurant added 13.
