“They have given the team great
motivation and leadership, both on
and off the field.” Both players
have had to switch. positions this
season due to changes in the line-
up. Hilles was playing forward and
is now playing right mid and right

back. Pepper switched from right
back to sweeper. “Both have played
exceptionally well given that they
have had to develop new skills for
their new positions,” says Pryor.
Senior goalkeeper Mary
Ferguson has been splitting time
with freshmen Tamara Carhart and

Sara Gebhart. Coach Pryor feels
the team “‘is very fortunate to have
such wonderful young talent.”
However, Pryor is thankful for the
five seniors she has this year as
well. They have lent a lot of stabil-
ity to the team, making it a very
cohesive team.

Volleyball whips Eagles

By David Aycock

Davidson’s women’s volley-
ball team improved this week with
abig win on Thursday night against
the Winthrop Eagles in Belk Arena.
The Wildcats were able to win in
four games behind the spirited play
of the entire team.

The Wildcats took the first
game in business-like fashion after
breaking away from a 5-5 tie to
win 15-8. Tara Smith led the ‘Cats
in the first game,: putting away
numerous kills and working well
with the rest of the team.

The Wildcats took the second
game as well, after falling be-
hind12-4, In a stunning come-
back, the ‘Cats fought back to win

16-14 and effectively broke the
spirit of a Winthrop team that was ~
looking forward to tying the match
at one game apiece. Senior Lorie
Logan led the team, helping them
keep their composure and making
some outstanding individual plays.

After losing the third game
15-8, the Wildcats took the match
by dominating play in the fourth,
winning the game 15-5 and taking
a much-needed home win. The
Wildcats will return to action this
week at UNC-Greensboro, UT-
Chattanooga, and Western Caro-
lina. The next two home games
will be during Parents’ Weekend,
against Georgia Southern and
Furman.

Swimmers make good

Duke is 7-0. How’s that

By. Jason Byassee

The football program that has
repeatedly been in last place in the
ACC is suddenly undefeated and
faston FSU’s heels forthe league’s
top spot. The article in Sports Illus-
trated a few weeks back which
featured the Blue Devils actually
made Duke’s players look mean.
Misplaced Duke fans (i.e. yours
truly) are reveling in their renewed
football glory.

Lest we get too excited, ahunk
of the Devils’ success may be ac-
credited to their schedulemaker.
None of Duke’s seven wins has
come against a formidable oppo-
nent. Inaddition, all four of Duke’s
remaining foes have spent time in
the nation’s top-25 this year. Duke
could lose all four games, but they
probably won’t. We’ll see.

Surprisingly enough, suct:
rampant winning in football is hot
totally unprecedented for Duke.
The year was 1989. Duke started
the season in typical fashion: they

were 1-3. They were playing
Clemson, #7 in the country. After
falling behind 14-0 in the first quar-
ter, Duke had finally put a decent
offensive drive together and was
inside the Clemson five-yard line.
On third down their tailback
seemed to have been stopped cold
at the line of scrimmage. The Duke
linemen were walking back to the
huddle, thinking that their man had
been tackled. But the play wasn’t
dead. Randy Cuthbert, the Duke
tailback, had been hit initially by
the entire Clemson defensive line
but had refused to go down. He
carried what seemed like the entire
Clemson defense on his back from
the 5 into the end zone for the
touchdown.

That play seemed to mark the
point where the football gods
reached down and anointed the
restof Duke’s football season. They
went on to beat the Tigers 21-17
and proceeded to go on a tear. If
Duke’s 1-3 record before the

possible?

Clemson game looked normal for
them, their 8-3 record at the end of
the season certainly did not.

Duke finished the season in
style, beating UNC 41-0 in Chapel
Hill. They accepted an offer to
play Texas Tech in the All-Ameri-
can Bowl, and my family jour-
neyed to the game in hopes that the
magic would continue. It would
not: Duke lost by three touchdowns,
and Coach Spurrier left Duke to
take over at Florida. Easy come,
easy go.

Here’s what that means for
this year’s team. Following that
fateful Clemson game in 1989,
Duke ran off seven straight victo-
ries to win the ACC and attend
their first bowl in years. The bowl
was when they hit some more for-
midable competition, which proved
to be too much for them to handle.
Does the history of Duke’s success
hold some foreshadowing for this
Duke team of 1994?

This year, Duke has had seven

he lines up for every down of the
game at defensive end and offen-
sive tackle. Bo Bartholomew,

Mills Arial, and James Cassidy get -

in on about 20 to 30 plays on of-
fense when the Wildcats use their
“Robust Offense” package. The
defense had seven sacks of the
afternoon as junior Cassidy led the
team with three sacks.

Now the Wildcats will travel
to Hampden-Sydney for their third
road game in a row. Davidson
hopes to capture their second win
of the season against a team that
features a similar level of experi-
ence.

“Hampden-Sydney is going to
beadecent offensiveteam. They’ ve

struggled a bit this season the way |

we have. We must come out and

establish some offense in the first
quarter for us to succeed,” said
Landis.

Following this weekend’s

game the Wildcats will return for
their final home game against Cen-

on November 5.

straight victories without playing
anybody. They’ ve got another fine
quarterback, another enormous
tailback, and another confident,
good ole’ boy coach. They cer-
tainly have the tools to be a good
team, and they have had a gift of a
schedule. Duke has their first true
test this week when they travel to
Tallahassee to take on Florida State.
Will they fold?

Here are some predictions for
you: Duke probably won’t col-
lapse against FSU, but they won’t
win, either. It’s true that stranger
things have happened, but this
Duke team simply isn’t as good as
the Seminoles. They also aren’t
gonna be sneaking up on anybody.

._ look for Duke to win one or two

both the women’s and men’s side,
the team felt as if it had achieved a
personal victory. After the meet
ended, Head Coach Rich DeSelm
said, “I don’t think the score re-
flects our level of accomplish-
ment.” Heis referring to the team’s
meet last year against VA Tech, in
which the Hokies’ margain of vic-
tory was much greater than this
year.

Individual wins were picked
up by freshmen Heather Sweeney
in the 200 IM and 200 breaststroke,
Kelly Bolterstein in the 50, Matt
Buck in the 200 breaststroke,
Michael Scarbo in the 1000, Freddy

also came from freshman Allison
