SPRING IS HERE !

The spring sport season is now in full swing, with the
Interfraternity track meet having been run yesterday and
practice for Varsity sports well under way. From our view
‘of the situation, this could be the best Davidson spring season
since the war, and an overall winning record seems a cer-
tainty.

Looking first at the baseball scene, we see Coach Chuck
Clements with the best pre-season possibilities in several
years. With three members of last year’s starting infield back
(Buzz Hope, Bill Morris, and Jim Kiser) plus two excellent
veteran pitchers (Johnny Smith and Ish Bennett), Coach
Clements needs only to replace the spots in the outfield
vacated by the graduation of Fred Stowe and Max Devane,
and the first base position held by Johnny Gray. Captain
Bill Rowland will again patrol the center garden, and Shorty
Sfaelos, last year’s starting catcher, will also be back.

Several members of last year’s freshman club are out
for the Varsity and will undoubtedly give some of the regu-
lars a rough time. It seems certain that at least two sopho-
mores will be in the starting line-up, and the reserve strength
will allow juggling of the line-up to suit the situation—some-
thing which has been impossible in the past. There are also
some frosh candidates. Several are showing a lot of skill and
could be around next Thursday when the season opens.

Looking next at golf, we find the two leading members
of the Southern Conference championship team gone, but
prospects remain bright for a very successful season. Mickey
Cannon and Skipper Hall lead the returning members of the
squad, while several newcomers will fill the gap left by
Graeme Keith and Joe Jenkins. Jenkins was the runner-up
in the Southern Conference Tourney last spring, and Keith
was the No. 1 man on the squad for the season.

Leading the newcomers in the links game is Pat Brady,
North Carolina Junior Champion. Ned Payne, a frosh candi-
date, has also been looking good, and there are a host of
upperclassmen out for the squad. The turnout in answer
to Coach Danny Miller’s cal) for candidates has been tre-
mendous. All tryouts were due to be finished by this time,
and from these the squad will be selected.

In track, Coach Pete Whittle has a large number of candi-
dates for the team, and it appears that Whittle will come
up with his usual winner. Pete Ashcraft, Southern indoor
champion in the mile and two mile runs, will pace the dis-
tance men, while Phil Koonce and Frank Mitchener will lead
the dashers. Bill Gramley and Bill Lazenby will be back in
the weight events, and Jack Huffaker will return in the high
jump. It looks to be a very promising season, and with 2
little luck, the track team might go undefeated in dual com-

petition.

The tennis outlook is, perhaps, best of all. Coach Dick
McKee has top man Lacy Keesler back as well as Corky Clark,
Leighton Green, and George Snead. Keesler will defend his
Southern Conference singles championship, and Clark and
Snead will try to hold the doubles crown. These four form
the nucleus around which this year’s team will be built, and
the squad will be bolstered by Chick McClure, John Robin-
son, John Thorpe, and Dick Makepeace. Thorpe and Robin-
son are up from last year’s freshman squad, while Make-
peace is only a freshman this year.

THIS AND THAT

Members of the Wildcat basketball squad are singing the
praises of West Virginia’s great guard, Hot Rod Hundley, who
paced the Mountaineers to the conference championship in
Richmond last week. Hundley, in addition to his usual bag of
tricks, played some fine basketball which was definitely
serious.
A familiar cry arose in the Alumni section last Saturday
when one supporter stood up and gave support to the Varsity
—"Pass Him Back!” ;

Hobby Cobb made Honorable Mention on the Southern
Conference seasonal All-Star squad. The Charlotte boy
finished the season with a 21.5 average per game and was
No. 13 in the country in field goal accuracy—51.5 per cent.

Golf Schedule Sel;
Open With Fla. Trip

Davidson's golf team, the reign-
ing Southern Conference Champs,
have begun workouts as spring ap-
proaches. Led by Coach Danny
Miller, only recently returned from
the basketball wars, they are
spending long hours on the links
in preparation for the fast ap-
proaching schedule.

At present the biggest problem
is in filling the large shoes of last
year’s captain, Grahme: Keith, and
Joe Jenkins, runner-up for the
conference individual champion-
ship. However, if the qualifying
rounds of this week are any indica-
tion, Davidson should again rank
high.

With a large turnout for the
squad, the boys to take the Florida
trip during the holidays will prob-
ably be seven or eight of the fol-
lowing: Martin Foil, George Scott,
Ed Douglas, Roger Little, Stuart
Vaughn, Larry Parrot, Al Gaither,
Mickey Cannon, Skipper Hall and
Charlie Feezor.

The return of Al Gaither should
help in taking up the slack. Of
the frosh candidates, Charlie
Feezor appears to stand out at
present. Foil, Douglas, Parrot,
Gaither, Cannon, and Hall are
among the returning lettermen.
The actual composition of the
squad will be determined at the
end of this week’s qualifying.

The schedule for the year is as
follows:

Warlick, Regen Win
Spots in 5.C. Meet.

Rave Regen and Bill Warlick
were the lone Wildcat survivors of
the Southern Conference Wrest-
ling Meet last weekend, and the
depleted Davidson team only got
two points in the meet, Regen and
Warlick both finished in fourth
place in their divisions.

Only five grapplers made the
trip to Lexington, and only one
survived the first round. Johnny

Sigs

Kappa Sigma established itself
as the team to beat in the inter-
fraternity race yesterday as the
interfraternity track meet closed
showing the “Kapper Snappers”
well out in front of the field. This
gives the Kappa Sigs a solid lead in
total points going into the spring
sports. ‘

They picked up ten points on
the SAEs in the last three events
to win by a 10.5 point margin. Win-
ning four first places and five
second slots, the Kappa Sigs out-
distanced the SAEs and Phi Delts
easily.

Lynn was high point man for the
victors, getting 11 points from two
firsts and a fourth. Ted Baker and
Henry Brown were leading point-
getters for the SAEs, while Don
Stewart and Phil Diugiud led the
Phi Delts.

‘The meet brought no new
records, but the Phi Delt relay
team only missed the Kappa Sig’s
record (set in 1953) by one tenth
of a second. Dale Gramley missed
by less than a foot the record set
by brother Bill only last year.

‘Snappers’ Now Favored
To Capture Greek Trophy

The Kappa Sigs beat the Pikas
in their final game of the season
last Monday as they wrapped up
the championship in interfraterni-
ty basketball. The Kappa Sigs
backed into sole possession of the
title by virtue of an upset win by
the Phi Delts over the Sigma Chis
who dropped to second.

Last week's action saw the Kappa
Sigs suffer their first loss of the
season as they dropped a game to
the Betas. That moved the race
into a two-way tie, with the Sigma
Chis and Kappa Sigs both having
lost only one game, and it set the
stage for the clinchers this week.

The upset of the Sigma Chis
came on a last-second shot by Bill
Hopper which was high in the air
when the final horn sounded, The
Sigma Chis had tied the score in
the final minute after having
trailed for most of the game.

The season is now complete, and
the standings are shown below:

Wildcats Edge Grads
In Spring Contest

Davidson's Varsity footballers
were hosts to the Wildcat “Old-
timers” here last Saturday, and
the present day boys squeezed out
a 19-7. decision over the Alumni
squad. In a game much closer than
many expected, the Varsity was
twice forced to stop the Alumni in
the danger zone before they could
claim the victory.

The Varsity scored first in the
contest, with quarterback Dick
Belton sneaking over from the one
yard line in the first quarter, but
the Alumni came back to tie it up
in the second period as Mac Erwin
charged ‘over from the two-yard
marker,

The final Wildcat tallies came
on passes from Belton, the first
being a nine-yard toss to Jim Pat-
terson and the second a 21-yard flip
to Bill Gramley.

The: Varsity did not look as
polished as last fall’s club, but this
might be expected after long work-
outs with no games to point for.
Harley Smith was, by far, the out-
standing Wildcat back of the day,
picking up 125 yards in only 12
carries. A consistent gainer all
day, Smith’s 55-yard gallop late in
the fourth quarter set up the final
Varsity TD.

On the Alumni side of the
ledger, Mac Erwin and Auburn
Lambeth stood out as the stars of
the backfield. Erwin: carried the
the balt on almost half of the
Oldtimer plays, and. he was never
dropped for a loss. On defense, he
did well, too, several times knock-
ing the Varsity ends away from
seemingly completed passes.
