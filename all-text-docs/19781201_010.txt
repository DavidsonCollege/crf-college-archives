Grapplers anticipate success

The combination of a new
coach and some old talent this
season may help to re-establish
a winning tradition for the

Davidson wrestling squad.
Despite a 2-8 record last year,

the team is optimistic about -

this season. Senior Captain Pat

‘Dulany contended that last

year’s record was caused in part
by the lack of a wrestler ih the
118 pound division and by
several injuries. Finally, Dula-
ny noted ‘that the team lost

Charlie Parker, to illness.

coach, Dr. L.R. King of the
math department. King com-
peted in wrestling at Davidson
as a college student. Captain
Dulany said King’s enthusiastic
attitude and leadership could be
a decisive factor.

“The team has been practi-
cing six days a week since

mid-October, and we've pushed.

last year’s captain. The top four
wrestlers, Dulaney, Scott Phil-
lips, Pat McKinsey, and Rob
King, all return.

The team’s main strengths
will be experience, according to
Dulany. Six seniors are wrest-
ling, mostly in the lower weight
classes.

largely based on the attitude,
ability, and leadership of Pat
(Dulany). He is an inspiration
to the team.”

Ironically, one of this year's
greatest strengths, the leader-

‘ship provided by the seniors,

could become next year’s chief

liability. King expressed great
concern about the continuity of
the Davidson wrestling pro-

at least one or two a year. This
means we have to actively
recruit from the existing stu-
dent body. The talent is out
there, and-we encourage all
those interested to come out.”

King is particularly con-
cerned that the team does not
have a 190 pounder; and hopes
that anyone interested will con-
tact him. —_

This year’s most promising
freshmen is Scott Smith, who
will be vying for a position at:
either the 134 or the 142 pound
weight class. |
