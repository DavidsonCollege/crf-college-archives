BASKETBALL GLEANINGS. |SCHENCK FOOTBAL. “

From all indications the various
college and “Y” teams in N. C., are
very evenly matched this season,
and any game scheduled will be a
hard one. The dope has been
slightly in favor of the University of
North Carolina, and by upsetting
the dope in her first game with this
Carolina quint the Wildcats loomed
up with bright possibilities, With
a week of hard games on foreign
courts the dope stands a good
chance of being upset again. How-.
ever, with the team in good order
under the able direction of Coach
Hengeveld, Davidson is looking for-
ward eagerly to the contests of the
week. A return game at Davidson
is scheduled with Guilford, North
Carolina “State. and Wake Forest.

e

Carolina is expecting to turn the
tables in the second game with
Davidson at Chapel Hill. Every
effort will be made to guard Roberts
who scored 17 points in the game at
Davidson. Regardless of all efforts
the Wildcats will again be out to
“fight, fight, fight for victory, and
the name of old D. C.”

N. C State has a_ heavy
team, corresponding to her football |
eleven. Cline, captain, and Gurley ;
are playing the guard positions.
Groome, an old basketball star, is
at center, while Ripple and Deal are
holding down the forward positions.

Elon has practically the same
team as last year, when the Wild-
cats secured the decision. Elon has
been defeated by Guilford and Trin-
ity, and if true to their form, the
Wildcats should administer a simi-
lar defeat.

The coming week will see many
of the basketball teams of this state
as well as the entire South, swing
into real action for the first time
this season. Only a few games have
been played thus far, but from the
class of ball being displayed it is
evident that the contests for the
various championships will be un-
usually bitter.

_The scores of some of the contests
which have already been staged are
as follows:

Trinity, 22; Guilford, 20.

Trinity, 18; lon, 16.

Univ. of N. C., 50; Guilford, 23.

University of N. C., 32; Charlotte

L
~~ MANAGER FOR 1920

Last Week, at a meeting of the
Athletic Association, Lewis  B.
Schenck was elected manager of the
football team for the 1920 season.
Schenck's enforced r@tirement from
his role as premier basketball artist
for a few weeks will enable him to
bring,to a rapid completion the nu-
merous details which are a neces-
sary evil in the making and perfect-
ing of any such undertaking.

As all of us know, Schenck’s ca-
reeg at Davidson has been a succes-
sion Of ably filled offices in the vari-
ous class and student body organi-
zations, and he is therefore very
well prepared to take over the reins
in his most recent capacity. His ac-
tivities, as is mentioned above, have
also carried him to a prominent part
on the basketball squad and thus we
see in him a combination of execu-
tive ability and an understanding of
human nature; which, we ara confi-
dent, will carry him thru his term
as football manager with flyihg col-
ors. :

OUR CHINESE STUDENT
NARRATES EXPERIENCES

*
Meng Tells of First Impressions of
, America.

| had my first sight of America,
September H1, 1919, when I landed
in San Francisco with 146 Chinese
students. After the long blankness
at sea,-so many new things seemed
to come all of a sudden, We all en-
joyed lindthg, though it had been
very pleasapt on the sea. Then we
busied vurselves at touring. We
visited all the famous places of Cali-
fornia. We ascended on top of
Tamalpais and also to Muir Woods,
where we saw the small cabin of
Mark Twain.

Then we started for our various
destinations. All of the other stu-
dents were distributed in the West
and North and T alone was to go to
the South.

I faced my long trip with the
spirit of an adventurer and managed
my affairs with the utmost care.
After + had checked my baggage
through, | emerged with the crowd
to the “trair bravely though with a
little nervoysness. The first person
J encountered was the Pullman por-
ter. L waggdelighted to see the ac-
tual persohtwhom [ had read about
in Uncle Tom’s Cabin. By associa-
tion the story of Lincoln and the
Civil War was brought inte my
mind. ,

This strange porter conducted me
to my seat. | glanced around. All
faces were new to me. For the first
time | felt lonesome and was con-
scious of the fact that 1 was in a
foreign country. I felt that I was
an outcast from fellowship and sym-
pathy. | turned my eyes indiffer-
ently toward the outside and tried
to amuse myself with the: pretty
California landscape. My idle mind
began to meditate. ‘

| wondered why should Nature
play so many tricks with creation.
1 like to have fellowship and hos-
pitality everywhere so that good
will prevails against prejudices and
indifierence so that poor travelers
will not feel homesick. But the dif-
ferences in appearance, language

and customs render that world
brotherhood — almost —_ impossible.
Traditional hatred and national

prejudices make the natural barriers
worse anil deeper. Why should the
world have strifes, unfriendliness
and horrible wars?

1 do not blame Nature for creating
these natural |barriers, but I see
with pain that pedple are still unable
to get rid of this narrowness, I re-
call the noble idea of Tolstoi. He
says thht the creation is one “life”
and that one substance, one person
or one nation is but part of that
“life.” Those who injured others
injured this ‘life’ and therefore in-
jured themselves.

After this‘ meditation, I felt my-
self cheered up. “I wilt make fel-

lowship. I must overcome natural
difficulties.”
With new vigor and cheerful

frame of mind I turned my eyes on
the people in the car.
