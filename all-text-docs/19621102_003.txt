THE BIG TIME
Davidson on T.V.?

be on the tube. For all you doubting Thomases, why
don’t you go over to the stadium tomorrow and trip over
a cable or two.

Pfeiffer and they usually field
a good team. Last year they
barely edged the ‘Cats out 3-2
in a game here. Fogleman says
that he expects a very tough
game from them.

In case you're wondering how all this came about,
the story is a long one. It goes back several years to the
time when Athletic Director Tom Scott first came up with
the idea of televising some of Davidson’s games. Not
much came of it for a while until this summer when
Scott was able to get permission to televise our games
from the NCAA.

because the NCAA. has : suey that no teams playing a er
major schedule can televise their games since it would
interfere with the game of the week telecast. Since Dav-
idson is classed as playing a minor schedule, Scott was
able to get an O.K. from them on local broadcasts.

Scoring started early in the
game from a long, high shot
by Zach Smith, which dropped

One of Guilford’s goals was
tainted by the fact that it was

After Scott got NCAA permission, he worked closely
with Castleman Chesley, an independent producer from
Philadelphia, and the officials of station WSOC to set up
the details. Chesley, who is producing the game, also
produces many other sports events, including ACC basket-
ball games.

Christian Faber-Rod picked
