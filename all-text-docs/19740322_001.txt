Impoverished Helped

By CHARLIE SHEPHERD
Managing Editor

Inflation has hit everyone
hard in many ways, but
perhaps food in one of the
most vulnerable areas. In the
Davidson-Cornelius area
there are retired persons,
people who have a handicap,
and people who simply do not
make enough money to live
on; some of these people are
not getting enough to eat.

Food stamps are one way to
help the people get more food,
and the Charlotte Area Fund
is working with the Mecklen-
burg County Department of
Social Services to let people
know about food stamps. The
Davidson YMCA is sponsoring
a local drive to publicize the
stamps and to help people
acquire them. Director of the
News Bureau Earl W.
Lawrimore is heading up the
drive.

Last Tuesday a meeting was
held at the Depot to coordinate

Hall Contests Duke Power’s
Rate Increase In Open-End

By CHARLES KENNON
Asst. Managing Editor

State Coordinator of the
North Carolina Public Interest
Research Group's fight again-
st Duke Power Company's 17
percent rate increase Bob Hall
led a discussion of NC PIRG’s
argument against the rate in-
crease Wednesday night at an
Open End.

Originally the Open End
was to be a debate between NC
PIRG and Duke Power Com-
pany, but Duke chose not to
send a representative to
debate the issue.

The increase would be un-
necessary if the rate system
were altared to reflect these
percentages, according to
Hall.

‘‘We want to make the rates
more equitable and make
Duke accountable to the
public for its actions,” Hall
said.

“The problem with Duke is
that its present customers are
expanding their use of energy,
not that it is adding large
amounts of new customers.
And Duke advertises to get
people to use more.

“The industries are ex-
panding the most, yet the
resident consumers are
paying more. I feel that those
who use the most electricity
should pay for these ads and
expansion of Duke's
facilities.

‘“‘Duke simply wants money
to show investors that they
can get a good return for their
money, and then Duke takes
its money and builds more
plants,’’ Hall said.

Mac MackKeithen, chairman
of the Davidson branch of NC
PIRG, initiated the discussion
saying, ‘“‘We wanted to get a
two sided discussion. Duke
justified their failure to ap-
pear by saying they didn’t
want to jeopardize the current
hearing before the Public
Utilities Commission on the
rate increase. I feel that the
real reason is that they aren’t
fully prepared to talk about
the facts.”

Hall explained what he felt
were the reasons for Duke’s
refusal to discuss the con-
troversial issue.

‘‘Duke is asking the people
of North Carolina to pay $60
million more. They have
refused to appear several
times, claiming thai a rate
hearing is like a court case,
that outside discussion would
harm the objectivity
necessary to decide fairly.

‘‘But the counselors in-
volved in the hearings have
stated that it is not like a court
case, and that silence is not
mandatory. More public talk
is needed so that the con-
sumers are fully aware of just
what is taking place,’’ Hall
said.

He then criticized Duke’s
tactics in lobbying for its goals
and its methods of financing
advertising.

‘“‘Duke’s style is to sneak
behind our backs and arrange
for a bill that will create a
legitimate base for their in-
crease. Their failure to show
tonight indicates that they are
afraid that they will loose if
the truth were shown.

“This bill, in essence, will
allow Duke to decide the need
for rate increases based on
projected needs in the future
year, rather than on the real
needs of the past year. And
they are not willing to bring
this out into the open but hide
behind adds that we pay for,”
Hall contended.

the Davidson food stamp
program. About 40 people at-
tended, including faculty,
students and other members
of the Davidson-Cornelius
community. Volunteers were

assigned churches and schools
to contact about the program.

Hopefully, volunteers will
contact ministers before Sun-
day so that information about
the food stamps can be
distributed to the members of
the congregations. In addition,
officials from Charlotte will
conduct an interview session
at the Depot from 10 to 3 on
Saturday, March 30th.

At the interview session,
people will be given more in-
formation about how to obtain
food stamps and will be ad-
vised on their chances of get-
ting the stamps.

The department of
Agriculture distributed the
food stamps, which allow
people to buy food at grocery
stores at a discount. The stam-
ps are only for food; not paper
goods, soft drinks, alcoholic
beverages or similar goods
may be purchased with them.
The stamps are not money and
cannot be sold, traded or given
away.

Lawrimore hopes to have
enough people at the meeting
on March 30 to convince the
Charlotte Area Fund to send
someone to Davidson to
register people in the David-
son-Cornelius community.
‘For many eligible people in
our area transportation to
Charlotte is either very in-
convenient or even impossible
for some,”’ he commented.

_. With Food Stamps

In addition to distributing
information sheets in the chur-
ches and elementary schools,
a group of students will go
door-to-door handing out the
sheets next week. Through
this canvasing Lawrimore
hopes to reach as many
eligible people in the com-
munity as possible.

The stamps are not welfare
and they must be payed for,
although the amount is

nominal. Also, the amount of
stamps persons are eligible to
receive depends on their in-

come and the number of
people in their households. In-
come is measured on a mon-
thly basis after deductions are
subtracted. The stamps can be
picked up after the individual
has been registered at the
Davidson or Cornelius post of-
fices, or in some cases may be
mailed to the home.
Lawrimore encouraged
students to attend a meeting
next Tuesday night at 7:30 if

they would like to help
distribute information sheets
for the program.

Phi Beta Kappas Emphasize
Character, Scholastic Merit

By MATTHEW COVINGTON
Asst. Managing Editor

On March 12, at their annual
selection meeting, Davidson
College faculty members of
Phi Beta Kappa elected into
their society 29 Davidson
students. These honored
students join more than 800
other Davidsonians who have
been elected in the society’s
first 50 years at Davidson.

After Phi Beta Kappa’s
original charter was drawn up
at William and Mary College,
establishing a society of
academic excellence, David-
son College was granted the
Gamma charter of North
Carolina by the United Chap-
ters of Phi Beta Kappa in 1923.

To be eligible for selection,
one must be more than a good
student. To enter Phi Beta
Kappa, one must maintain a
grade point average of 3.6 or
better and ‘‘possess the
qualifications of high scholar-
ship, liberal culture, and good
character”. These require-
ments assure Phi Beta
Kappa that their selectees

each year are of high
caliber. Only 12.5 percent of a
given class may be selected
each year.

The selected students. are to
be initiated, along with those
who were selected last year at
Commencement, at the an-
nual Phi Beta Kappa banquet,
this year on April 24.
Following the banquet will be
