Greg Garrison ‘97, author of Ramblin’ Man

By STEPHEN CEFALU
Staff Writer

Rarely does the literary world
encounter an author brazen enough

to incorporate Elvis Presley, voo-
doo, religion and gender politics
all into his debut novel.

But that is precisely what
Greg Garrison, a Davidson senior

Will Nolen

math major, has done.

Garrison’s premier work,
Ramblin’ Man, is a 400 page mys-
tery novel which he wrote in a
frenzied five week span in the
spring of 1995.

Now Greg is already hard at
work ona sequel to Ramblin’ Man,
called Rainy Day Women.

Set in modern day Carolina,
both of Garrison’s works are ca-
sual in tone, and designed to speak
directly to the reader.

Garrison says of Ramblin’
Man, “I wanted it to be both deep
and funny.”

With a strong storyline and
attention to character development,
Garrison feels he accomplished
what he set out to in writing

Ramblin’ Man.

“TI wanted to give to other
people what writers have been giv-
ing to me all my life” says Garri-
son.

Among diverse group of per-
sonal influences, Garrison cites
Mark Twain, Jimmy Buffet, and
Walker Percy.

A lover of pulp fiction, Garri-
son describes writing mysteries as
“fun and easy,” though the writing
spree that produced Ramblin’ Man
was not devoid of intensity.

Garrison describes himself
during that time period as “con-
sumed by the novel.”

Garrison classifies himself as
a modernist, but his first priority is
good storytelling.

In this respect, Garrison says
he’s benefitted from his experi-
ence with films and cartoons.

As for his reading audience,
Garrison says, “I want to encour-
age in them a desire to grab on to
life, to live it 100 percent.”

The few who have glimpsed
the as yet unpublished Ramblin’
Man have noted in particular its
realistic dialogue and sophisticated
humor.

However, Garrison says
Ramblin’ Man was mostly sponta-
neous.

“J just wanted to get it down
on paper, to find out, myself, what
was going to happen next in the
story.”

choice but to start towing again.”

“We’ve been looking at the
problem since the beginning of the
semester,” says Junior Class Presi-
dent Lucian Dervan, co-chair of
the SAC on Public Safety. Dervan
explains-that when the semester
began, “the greatest problem was
seen to be the new $80 vehicle
registration fee, not the towing situ-
ation.” However, as the year pro-
gressed, student complaints about
frequent towings continued.

“The reason the police depart-
_ ment [initially] chose to tow was
that tickets weren’t enough of a
deterrent to keep students from
parking [in faculty] spaces,” says
Dervan.

Dervan notes that the towing
agreement pertains only to faculty
spaces. Any student illegally
parked in visitor parking “‘is still
going tobe towed,” he says, “along
with [illegally parked cars in]
handicapped spaces and firelanes.”

In addition, students who park
in the laundry lot— even on week-
ends — will continue to be towed.
