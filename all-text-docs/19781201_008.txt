tion tournament,

tant Director-of the College -

Pleased with the turnout of
students this season, he hopes

the championship tournament.

Quadrivium and Missing Link
Wednesday night; each had
been defeated only once before.
The Young Utopians defeated
Missing Link, and the Fluids

In every game two teams of
four players, each match their
skills and try to answer ques-

tions which cover a wide range

of subjects.

_The game consists ot two ten
minute halves in which speed
and accuracy are the crucial
factors. There are two types of
questions, the toss-up worth
ten points and the bonus worth
twenty or thirty points.

Essentially any student’ can

Experiential programs help

By J. W. ARETINO
Staff Writer

You know what you want to
do, where you want to do it, and
how to manage your career after
graduation.... .

While recovering from the
scars of another add-drop battle
with the Davidson computer
system and wondering how
many days before Christmas
break, some students will take
some time out to wander down
to the Office for Experiential
Programs in the basement of
the union to do some “‘explor-
ing.”

Most students are aware of
the many opportunities avail-

“For all your
flower needs.”

oes

able for internships during the
school year and in the summer.
However, another important
option is also available, an
externship.

The program was begun offi-
cially four years ago and origin-
ally involved twelve to fifteen
people. Students had the oppor-
tunity to work for a week,
usually during spring break, in
a field that was of personal
interest. The program has
grown rapidly, now involving
nearly sixty people.

Most of the externships are
short, lasting from three to five
days during a break. An ex-
pressed interest by a student
leads to phone calls and letters
to alumni and friends of the
college.

. Ken Wood, Director of the
Office for Experiential Prog-
rams, says that 95 percent of
the alumni contacted were

“eager” to help. Even response
from people not affiliated with
the college has been great.

Past externships have in-
volved work with the United
Way, U.S. House of Represen-
tatives, work at the Center for
Disease Control, and even work
in an obscure field like aerobics.

Wood emphasized some of
the benefits from the program.

Originally it was felt the pro-
gram would be beneficial in
relations with the alumni and
with setting up later intern-
ships. However, students have
returned with observations and
experience that have directly
benefited career planning.
Students are able to plan
majors and coursework after an
externship and have developed
contacts for possible future
internships or summer jobs:
