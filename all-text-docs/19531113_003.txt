THE DAVIDSONIAN

PAGE THREE

The casual observer
of the Davidson Wild-
cat football scene
would probably see lit-
‘tle to be happy about
or to express any en-
thusiasm over either
now in the future.
However, a little closer
inspection might re-
' veal to the gridiron
prophet a little brigh-
ter outlook for next
season’s Wildcat parti-
cipation in  intercol-
t legiate football witen

.8 September 1954 rolls
By JOHN HANDLEY around. There’s quite
a difference between having good chances of winning and pro-
ducing a winning margin for the record books, but the Cats,
on paper at least, are looking forward to a much more suc-
cessful season next year.

As we pointed out last week in relation to this year’s
basketball team, next year’s football team will face a little
more Davidson-size opposition in a much improved schedule
over this year’s tough one. The Cats will drop four of the
powers who are constantly pouring more and more into their
football participation to play teams of a little more the size
and budget of Davidson. The Cats will not face Georgia Tech,
Richmond, Harvard, and George Washington, while picking
up VMI, Florida State, and Wofford. The Red and Black will
meet the Citadel, Presbyterian, N.C. State, Furman, and W.&L.
in traditional contests. This lineup, it seems to this writer,
is much more in keeping with the spirit of the Davidson ath-
letic system and should prove more satisfactory for the Cats.

Not Many Lost to June Graduation

Then we might examine the graduation list to determine
what key men on this year’s squad will receive their sheep-
skins (whether block or script Latin) come next June. In the
ball carrying department there is the bright prospect of not
losing a single first stringer. Both Henry Brown and Bill Row-
land at the quarterback spot will return next season for
another year’s action, while Jimmy Thacker and Harley Smith
will be back in their usual halfback posts and big Leroy Far-
gason will return to the power slot. Other backfield per-
formers such as Jimmy Shelton, Tal Broughton and Dave
Hambrick will also return to next year’s action.

Yn the line the story is a little sadder with the losses
of such men as the Captain, Alternate Captain combo of Ben
Craig and Neil Graham at the tackle posts going out with the
June graduates. Sturdy Bob Patten at guard will also be sore-
ly missed next season. Bill Acker at center will be missed
along with Dan McCall at an end. However, from this report
one might notice that Coach Dole has men to fill each of
these positions next season. Jim Patterson, Charlie Cousar,
Jimmy Davis, and Corky King will return at the ends. Perhaps
the tackle spots will be the hardest to fill with Tom Owen the
only regular to be back next year. Gene Davis, Dickie Davis,
Bill Abernathy, and Harold Davis will all return at the guards,
while Harry Petersen and Don Moore will be back at center.
In the backfield, as we pointed out earlier, each of the regulars
will return.

Freshman Team Could Mean Difference Next Year

Then glancing at Coach Dole’s pride,and joy, the fresh-
man team, we see another encouraging front. With such names
as Dyke Little, whose passes have been the difference in sev-
eral games for the frosh, Gregg Poole, Don McCree, and Ken
Conger in the backfield, prospects for some good varsity ma-
terial are good. In the line such men as Bill Gramley, Lyle
Llewelyn, and Tom Lee should reinforce Davidson's forward
defenses, for next season’s action.

All the prospects are bright for the Cats for next season
and if Coach Dole can continue to produce such freshmen
teams as this year’s version, Davidson football fortunes are
definitely on the upgrade. In only his second year at David-
son, Coach Dole has brought some fine men to the campus
and his building program is about to pay off.

Wrestling Tourney Opens
Wednesday For Greeks

With the close of the football season all the sports minded
Greeks are turning to wrestling as the next big sports event.
The tournament will be held in Johnston Gymnasium on
November 18 and 19. There will be nine weight classes, be-
ginning with 123 pounds and going to the heavyweight or
unlimited class. _—

A lot of the stars of last year's
tournament are either ineligible
because of winning a letter or have
graduated. This leaves the field
wide open and from the looks of
the number of boys each after-
noon “sweating it out” on the mat,
the competition will be keen again
this year.

The defending champion Phi
Gams are expected to field the
team to beat. Leading contenders
are last year’s runner-ups, John
Flintom at 147 and Monty Little-
john in the 191 class. Freshmen
Joe Whitesell and Johnny Grey are
expected to be strong men in their
classes.

Second-place last year, the SPEs
lost several top men but will rest
their hopes on Jim Patterson and
Joel Blackwelder. Third-place Kap-
pa Sigs appear to have a good line-
up headed by Eddie Powe at 137
and Johnny Smith at 147.

Dave Burns, a strong contender
last year will shoulder the SAE
bid along with Henry Faison.
Dickie Webb in the 123-pond class,
and Larry Wright will team up
with Bill McElveen for the Betas.

The next sporting event on the
Greek calendar after the wrest-
ling tournament will be the swim-
ming tournament followed by the
ever popular basketball season.
Both these events are slated to
begin in December after the re-
turn from the Thanksgiving holl-
days.

Geo. Washington invades Jomorrow

Varsity Runners
Vie For So. Title

The Davidson cross country harriers will travel to Wil-
liamsburg, Va., for the annual Southern Conference cross
country meet to be held on the William and Mary Campus on
Monday. The locals are figured to place third behind West
Virginia and Virginia Military Institute.

Yesterday afternoon Davidson's
Red and Black varsity distance
men met the Blue Devils of Duke
University in a duel affair which
found the Cats on the losing end
of a close 25-31 count. Homer
Sparks, captain of the 1953 Wild-
eat harriers, took first ‘place in the
meet with a 21:10 time for the 3.8
mile Duke course.

The race was close all the way
and could easily have gone either
way. Coach Whittle expressed his
enthusiasm over the Cats showing

Wildkitien Cagers
‘Short, But Speedy’
In Early Workouts

The Davidson freshman basket-
ball team started working out Mon-
day night under the direction of
Coaches Miller and Fetzer with
what appears to be a willing and
able squad of 30 boys. The squad
is not a tall one, the tallest man
standing 6 foot 4 inches, and the
team will probably stick to a run-
ning and pressing attack due to
this lack of height. However, the
Wildkittens should make up in ag-
gressiveness what they lack in al-
titude.

The season's schedule has not
been completed yet, but the first
game has been set for December
2 when the freshmen will mect
Pfieffer Junior College here at Da-
vidson. The schedule will also in-
clude the UNC freshmen who will
also travel to the local campus.

Candidates for the squad are
George Scott, Jerry Brooks, Roger
Williams, Dave Long, Mal Mce-
Swain, John Hunter, Don Haley,
George Mitchell, Buster Jenkins,
Alex Shepard, Charles Brown, Bob
Pulliam, Leon Howell, David Shaw,
Tom LeCron, Richard Weeks, Bob
Shaw, Jim Covington, John Win-
frey, Snyder Garrison, Gordon
Swain, Tom Brewer, Barney Regen,
David McCaw, Jim Lippard, Allen
‘Harless, Andy Whaley, Buddy
Dye, Charley Gribble and Stewart
Vaughn.

and felt that it would help the
team in the conference meet on
Monday.

The other scorers for Davidson
were Floyd Feeney, Andy Turner,
Dick Lovette, and Paul Alexander.
Feeney placed third in the meet.

Duke Substitute

The Duke meet was substituted
at the last minute for the State
meet, which was postponed to the
same date of the Southern Con-
ference meet, making it impossi-
ble for the Cats to compete.

West Virginia will be favored
to take the Conference meet with
very little trovble. They won the
conference duel meet trophy this
year, having defeated William and
Mary, Richmond. and VMI for a
3-0 conference record. They also
defeated several top-notch Penn-
sylvania teams.

VMI Strong .
¢ VMI is expected to place second
followed closely by Davidson,
Washington and Lee, VPI, Rich-
mond, and William and Mary.

The Cats, although figured to
come in behind VMI, have a slim
chance of upsetting the Keydets
to take second place. VMI defeated
the Davidson team during the reg-
ular season by a high score, but
in comparing the times, the meet
was closer than the score indicated.

Sparks Leads

Captain Homer Sparks will lead
the locals in the meet. Sparks
placed in the top twenty-five in
last year's meet to be Davidson's
only trophy winner. Sparks has
placed first for Davidson in all
their meets thus far this season
and took meet fifst honors against
Maryville, Richmond and Duke.

Sparks wiil be followed closely.
by Floyd Feeney, Andy Turner,
and Dick Lovette. All three have
run well this year and should
finish in the top twenty-five in
the conference meet.

John Handley, Paul Alexander,
and Herschel Allen compose the
remainder of the team. Much is de-
pending on the showings of these
men as to the team’s placing at
Williamsburg.

Frosh Gridders
Success-Runners
Wind Up Monday

By JIM HOLSHOUSER
This weekend marks the close of fall action for Davidson’s
successful freshman teams. The frosh Harriers will wind up
their activities over at Raleigh on Monday, while the: gridders
boosted their final total to 3-1 last Saturday with an upset
over the favored Citadel Bullpups.

The freshman runners face the
Burlington Running Club tomorrow
morning on the local course to
start the busy weekend before
traveling to Raleigh for the State
meet Monday to cap off their reg-
ular season's activities. They will,
however, participate in the Caro-
lina’s AAU cross country meet here
next Saturday.

The Burlington club is coached
by the famed “Hard Rock” Simp-
son, Burlington's running mail-
man, who holds many phenomenal
records for distance running. The

‘club will bring a strong team to

oppose Sam Magill's sterling frosh
squad.

Monday the frosh cross country
team runs against the representa-
tives of North Carolina, N. C. State,
and Duke. It is a meet to decide
the freshman championship of the
state. The top five men on the
freshman team will represent Da-
vidson in the meet.

Last Friday, the frosh runners
downed the strong team from Lees-

°

McRae in a close meet, 29-27. Pete
Ashcraft again paved the way for
the win, taking first place in the
meet. Gordon Bondurant came in
third.

The frosh runners have now won
meets with Pheiffer Junior Col-
lege (twice) and Lees-McRae. The
North Carolina University fresh-
man runners have been the only
one capable of downing the Wild-
kitten runners.

Last Saturday, the freshman
gridders won their third game in
four starts as they downed the
Citadel frosh, 19-0. It was the final
game of the current season for the
Kittens, and they came through in
fine style.

Donnie McRee was the big gun
in the Davidson attack. He scored
all three touchdowns in the game
and gained a big hunk of the Da-
vidson yardage.

The local frosh outplayed the
Citadel team in every department,

DELTS TIE -- “STARS” PICKED

By BUDDY LILES

Two major events spotlighted
this week’s Greck tag football loop
action. These two important hap-
penings were the winding up of
this year’s season with the Phi
Delts and the Sigma Chis tying for
the first slot and the selection of
the coveted All-Fraternity team
berths. Kappa Sig junior, Corky
Clark, was named captain of the

FAVORED 10 TAKE
WRESTLING MEET

The Carolinas AAU Wrestling
Meet will be held at Davidson,
December 10th and 11th. The first
round matches will be held Thurs-
day night, with the semi-finals Fri-
day afternoon, and the finals Fri-
day night.

This tournament is open to all
amateurs in both North and South
Carolina as its name indicates, and
wrestlers from all over the area
are expected.

Although the exact number of
teams that will enter is not known,
the defending champions, Camp
Lejeune’s Marines, will definitely
not defend their title. Both Da-
vidson, last year’s runners-up, and
the Cherry Point Marines have a
very good chance at the title.

Davidson’s hopes rest on such
men as Bobby Joe Key and Kerry
Spiers, first and second, respec-
tively, at 114 Ibs. last year. Charles
Murray, who was fourth at 136,
and David Burns, Nabby Armfield,
and Henry Faison, who finished
second, third, and fourth in that
order at 191. ,

David Brown, who wrestled as
an independent at 160 last year,
will be one of the top contenders
for the freshman team, which will
be entered in addition to the var-

sity.

league's players. The Phi Deits

ing their.top performers, Ish Ben-
nett and Max Devane named in
the top seven.

The Phi Delts downed the SAEs
and cinched a tie for first place
in the Greck League, Scoring free-
ly and playing good defensive ball,
the Phi Delts moved into the first
place tie with the Sigma Chis. Each
team has a record of nine wins
and one loss.

Listed below are the players of
the first and second teams of the
1953 All-Fraternity voting:

Chesterfield

Contest

Last week the Chesterfield foot-
ball contest was extremely close.
It was so close that cartons of
Chesterfields were awarded to
Dick Sowerby and Carl Jackson,
both of whom predicted scores of
28 to 6. There were many other
good predictions, but as it turned
out, these were nearest the actual
34 to 7 score.

This week the Davidson-George
Washington game again will afford.
the amateur oracles on the campus
an opportunity to turn their
guesses into cigarettes. As always,
the nearest score of this week's
game will be good for a carton
of Chesterfields. The rules remain
the same. All predictions of scores
are to be written on an empty
Chesterfield wrapper along with
the entrant’s name and room num-
ber and deposited in the box in
the student store before 12 o'clock
Saturday.

the runner-up Kappa Sigs. He was
a mainstay on defense and one of
the favorite targets for the passes
of Eddie Powe.
Ray Harding, Sigma Chis
Ray Harding, despite the fact
that he didn't play in the past few
games due to basketball practice,
was nominated to the all-star team.
Ray was the spark of the co-cham-
pion, Sigma Chis. His running
passing and kicking was the big
factor in the success of the champs,
who were also champions in '52.
Bill Hanne, Pikas
Bill Hanna, whose Pika team
ended the year with an even record

was the main reason for their mo-
ments of glory along with Bob
Owen who secured a position on the
second all-campus team. Bill's
Speed and maneuverability made
him one of the most dangerous
threats in the league.

Fred Stowe, Sig Eps

Fred Stowe proved his ability
other than legal by directing the
SPEs to several upsets and making
them one of the toughest teams
in the league. It was his passing
which accounted for most of their
scoring. ,

‘Colonials Are Strongest

Since Ga. Tech’-- Dole

By BILL HESTON
Richardson Field will be the stage for the Davidson Wild-
cats’ second home encounter of the season when they meet
the Colonials of George Washington tomorrow at 2:30 p'm.

The Cats will be fighting a very
strong eleven from Washington
who have proven their capabilities
thus far this season by defeating
VMI, North Carolina State, and
Washington and Lee.

Cotonials Strong

Coach Dole believes the Colonials
will be the strongest team the Cats
have met this year since their de-
feat by the Yellow Jackets of
Georgia Tech.

The team spirit seems to be very
good, however it will take every
man playing at his “tops” if the
hometown boys are to come out
on the winning side.

Looked Good Against Terps

Last week George Washington
met the mighty Maryland machine
in Washington, D.C., in what
proved to be a hard-fought con-
test, however, the magnificent line
play of Maryland led them in the
second half to a 27-6 victory.

When the whistle blew for the
ending of the first half George
Washington left the gridiron with

MILLER PLEASED
AS CAGERS PREP
FOR EARLY OPENER

By ARCHIE JOYNER

“Mighty hopeful!” Ask Coach
Miller what the prospects are for
his cagers this year, and you will
get the same answer. “An interest-
ing” year is expected to develop
into one of Davidson’s more thrill-
ing and successful basketball sea-
sons.

With the Southern Conference
narrowed down to ten teams, Coach
Miller is expecting a bid to the
conference tournament this year—
he pessimistically asserts his
chances as “fair.” The deciding
point will probably lie in the out-
come of the games between the
Virginia teams.

Miller Picks

Miller picks West Virginia, Fur-
man, George Washington, Rich-
mond and William and Mary as
sure contenders, but says that it

‘will be a scrap for the other three

spots.

His returning players who com-
prised a wholesome part of his
last year’s team, with added ex-
perience, should prove to be the
main stepping stone into the con-
ference tourney.

Starters Indefinite

No definite team has been
setected so far, but if the starters
in the varsity-freshman scrimmage
are any indication, Hobby Cobb,
Ish Bennett, Grahame Keith, Dick
Adams and Buddy Brown should
see a great deal of action this year.
Also high up on the roster are
Pappy Fowle and George Melton.
Melton and Keith will support the
center slot this year.

These seven will be the back-
bone of the team, though there is
hope that experience will produce
a potent reserve. Ed Weeks and
Ray Harding are the chief hope-
fuls, but lately they have been on
the sick list.
