“After seeing them play Tennessee—

Duke down to three touchdowns Satur-

day.” And so “Doc” Newton hit. things

on the head when he made the above
statement prior to the ‘Cats final ap-
pearance on Richardson Field this sea-

but formidable guard, certainly
filled Dick Johnson's Position ad-

broken nose. We've heard com-
pliments on all sides for the way
in which the little guard handled
his job.

confidence to supporters that we have in
that “thin red line,” is expected to re-

they backed

up the line
and held the score down.

Down in the dressing room, Fred Den-
nis, fullback, stated after the game that
“Carolina will beat Duke three toyich-
downs” while Hunter McClung gave a
linesman’s viewpoint by saying that
“Duke will beat Carolina” all of which
began a heated argument too long to be
repeated here,

Henry Cathey, co-Captain,
seemed to have been much. more
impressed with the Dukes, adding
that they “hit hard right on into
you.”’ Henry pointed out that Don
Jackson of UNC was not near as

‘ good as Parker and Alexander.

Of Jackson, Cathey said “‘He’s not

a runner. Hackney’s good but he

can’t do anything but run.”

Felix, Winchelling again, entered the
Duke dressing room but had only gotten
safely inside when a huge “paw” de-
scended upon his defenseless shoulder.
Somewhat disturbed at this and looking
around, it proved to be only “Little Joe
Cardwell, 215-pound 6.3 inches of tackle.

Assuming that the gesture was a
friendly one, Felix pumped the good-
natured giant about who Davidson's best
lineman were. After showing a broad
grin “Little Joe” acted as tho’ there
weren't any but finally he admitted that
he knew their faces but not their names.”
However, after aweing his audience by
consuming what appeared to be a whole
of an apple in one gulp, he added “that
blonde fellow in your line was good.”

Davidson Wildcats are practicing hard
this week in preparation for a meeting
with Virginia Military Institute, at Lex-
ington next Saturday. The cadets are
planning a retaliation for Davidson's vic-
tories in the past and hope to surprise
the Red and Black team. However, the
Wildcats are ready to face the attack of
the Virginians on Novy. 16.

smarting from this
the North Carolina game does not in-
dicate as much weakness in the Cadet
players as might be supposed because
several V. M. I. men were given a rest.
While two guards took positions in the
backfield, Robertson and Clark, the reg-
ulars, watched the game from the side-
lines. The Tar Heel contest does not
compare with the Davidson game, for
the Carolina squad was conceded an easy
win, This week a close scrap is expected.

Campbell, weighing 162 pounds, is a
backtield threat, whose work against the
lar Heels was exceptional. He was the
life of the Cadet play, as ~he punted,
tackled, and ran with the ball. Farley,
regular guard, playing fullback, showed
his weight and speed to advantage.
Others faced the Carolina line
were Kane, Fielder, Conte, and Coleman.

who

lhese_veterans from last year are hoping

tor a reversal of Davidson's 27-13 score
a year ago. Captain Hightower at left
tackle will be leading the V. M. I. push.
Rooker, the 185 pound center, will also
be part of the experienced and heavy
line. His consistent work has been sec-
onded by two newcomers, Bair and
Shomo.

Lettermen will compose the team to a
great extent, and the Cadets as a result
have a club definitely superior to that of
1934. Predictfons hold that V. M. I. has
better material than Citadel, so it will
take Wildcat spirit and tenacity to down
the revengeful Cadets.

Basketeers Start
Grueling Practice

A large number of men reported to
Coach Flake Laird for the initial basket-
ball practice of the season last week.
They have been practicing every night,
working on fundamentals, chiefly shoot-
ing and ball handling. Thus far, no player
has been outstanding, but all have been
doing very well, considering that they
have been in harness for only a week.

The schedule is almost complete and
will be ready for publication at an early
date. As it stands now, the schedule calls
for the first game to be played December
17 at Lenoir-Rhyne. However, according
to Coach Laird, there will probably be
two games arranged previous to that date.

A number of the candidates were mem-
bers of last year’s squad. These are Gene
Clark, Al Cumbie, Mokie Faison, George
Hornbeck, and Bill Harris. Several
others are playing football and will re-
port as soon as the season is over, Fred
Cathey, Ken Knorr, Morris Freeman,
Bill Quick, Bailey Williams, and Coley
Windham. Graduates from the 1934
Freshman team are Wade Barrow, Sky
Cline, Bill Keisewetter, Dan Iverson, and
Ellwood Moyer. Four of the men are
graduates of junior colleges, notably, W.
W. Hancock, W. J. Harper, H. C./ Year-
wood, and J. B. Armstrong,

The complete basketball schedule for
this season has not yet been announced
as being complete but several games have
been definitely scheduled. Four games
with teams near Davidson such as Elon,
Charlotte Y. M. C. A., Lenoir-Rhyne and
Catawba, will be played before the
Christmas holidays. After Christmas the
Cagers will take a trip, probably, to Vir-
ginia where they will play V. M. I, V.
P. I., and the University of Virginia.
Another trip will be taken during the sea-
son when they will engage games with
all the members of the “Big Five” name-
ly: Duke, North Carolina, N. C. State
and Wake Forest. These games have
been definitely scheduled but as to the
dates, they have not been announced as
yet.

FRESHMEN WIN.

Freshmen Win Intramurals With
~ Loss Of Single Game;
Juniors Second

At the close of the intramural basket-
ball competition, we find that the fresh-
men have walked away with the cham-!
pionship. The Frosh claimed the basket-
ball crown, winning five games and los-
ing one, ~scoring a total of twenty points
for the intra-competition.

The freshmen had as their star players
Nesbet Elmore, Jack Lee, Warren Gaw,
Locke ‘White, and others. On the whole
the freshmen have many good players
who should show up well in the coming
season.

The Juniors came close to the I’rosh,
winning four games and losing two, to
claim the position of second place in the
competitive race. In making second place,
the Juniors racked up fifteen points in
the intramural competition. Harmon
Woodward lead the fighting Juniors to
their four victories along with Al Cum-
bie.

The Seniors, led by Bill Bell, managed
to get the third place in the race, win-
ning three games and losing three while
the poor little sophomores landed in the
cellar, losing all six games that they
played.

The final score of the intramural com-
petition in basketball is Freshmen 20
points; Juniors 15; Seniors 10; and the
Sophs 5.

First Soccer Game To
Be Against High Point

Davidson's first varsity soccer team will
open its season on Friday, November 15,
with a game against High Point, the
contest to take place on the freshmen
football field.

Soccer is a comparatively new sport at
Davidson, although in other colleges in
the United States, especially those in the
north, it has gradually gained a fairly
important place in intercollegiate ath-
letics.

A tentative schedule has been ar-
ranged, the first game being against High
Point this Friday. Later there will be
a return game played at High Point. A

Aerial Circus During Second
Quarter

The Wildkittens proved in spite of
their overwhelming defeat, that they were
a vastly improved eleven since their
slaughter at the hands of the N. C. State
Frosh. . :

The Kittens won the toss and chose
to receive. Brown took the kick-off on
his own five yard line and returned it
to his twenty-three. After making a first
down in two plays after the kick-off,
Brown got seven yards off right tackle
and then Beatty rambled off a very nice
15 yard gain through left guard. On the
next play, Brown shot a beautiful pass
to Iverson, who caught the ball on the
50 yard marker and trying a lateral to
Stair, fumbled and the ball was recov-
ered by Wallace, stellar Imp left end.
The Duke Frosh then got right down to
the business of beating the Kittens. On
a sustained “‘steam-roller” march that
was irresistible, the Dukes made their
first touchdown. The Imps scored one
touchdown in both the first and last quar-
ters. They failed to score in the third
but piled up 20 points in the second. The
Kittens never threatened during the
morning but played stubbornly against
the more experienced Imps.

The Duke Frosh featured the run-
ning of flashy quarterback Gross and the
pass combination of Gross to Wallace to
mop up with the Kittens. The second
quarter gave the spectators an aerial cir-
cus that was responsible directly and in-
directly for all the markers in that quar-
ter. At the half, Coach Flake Laird ver-
bally polished up the Frosh pass defense
and in the third and fourth quarters the
Kittens were more successful in stop-
ping the Imp pass attack. Wallace, Duke
Frosh left end was responsible for two
of his team’s touchdowns,

‘Wallace, Haas, Ayres, Gross and Pe-
trey were responsible mostly for the de-
feat of the Davidson Frosh. Beatty, Mc-
Clelland, Gastiger and Brown were out-
standing for the Kittens.

All-Americans To Play
Mooresville’s Bulldogs

The “All Americans” will end their
playing season on Saturday, November
23, in a game with the Mooreswille Bull-
dogs. This is an amateur sandlot team
composed of ex-college and high school
stars,

Following this contest, the B team will
learn the Wake Forest plays and use
them in scrimmaging the varsity. Then
the team will disband Thanksgiving.
However, there is a slight possibility that
they will have another game with the
Freshmen some time near Thanksgiving.

The ‘All Americans” have rendered in-
valuable service to the varsity by using
in scrimmage the plays of the team whom
the varsity will. meet on the following
Saturday. They have been led on the
field by Bill Quick, Maurice Peabody,
Alex Brown, Tom Thurston, George
Mathis and several others,

Twenty Mount Holyoke College fresh-
men will be allowed to take only two
courses this: year under rules set down
for a unique educational experiment there.

Seniors at the Newark College of En-
gineering have voted in favor of allowing
women to enter their cfasses.

Blue Devils Pile Up Twelve First
Downs To Wildcats’ Eight

The Davidson Wildcats played dar-
ingly and spiritedly before a Home-com-
ing crowd of more than 7,000 people, but
the powerful Duke offense proved too
much for the fighting Cats and the Dev-
ils won 26-7.

Davidson opened the game with a suc-

cessful reverse to Lafferty good for a
first down. Then Pitt-
man faked a = run
around his right end,
faded, and threw a
long pass to “Teeny”
Lafferty down the
sidelines. Lafferty
caught the pass on a
run and seemed to
race the remaining dis-
tance for a touchdown,
but an official called
the ball back and put
it in play on Duke's
20 yard-line. This adverse decision
seemed to dishearten the Wildcats, for
they lost the ball on.downs. In the clos-
ing minutes of play, Fred Dennis recoy-
ered a fumble on Duke’s 20 yard stripe.
“Swede” Johnston then passed to Ed
Armfield, and the pass was ruled com-
plete on Duke’s one-foot liné. Johnston
then went over right guard for David-
son’s lone tally.
Elmore “Honey” Hackney and Frank
Liana led the Devil attack that netted
Wallace ‘Wade's charges a score in each
quarter. Hackney exhibited some of the
fanciest running
seen on Richard-
son in many a day,
while Liana seemed
to be in every play
all afternoon.

For the ’Cats.
Jim Johnston, who
replaced Dick
Johnson ,when the
latter had his nose
broken on the
opening kick - off,
played an outstand-
ing game at guard
for the greater part of the game. Captain
Cathey, Williams, “Six” Johnston, Mc-
Clung, and Burns led the linemen, while
Paul Pittman, Lafferty, Yarborough,
Dennis, Corbin, and Armfield stood out
for the backs, Liana, Eakins, Lipscomb,
and Hartness led the Blue Devil lines-
men, while Hackney, Hudgins, Gardner,
Smith, Parker, and Alexander were the
leading Duke ground-gainers.

had failed to click against Georgia Tech
