Harriers Entertain W & L
While JV Runs Pfieffer

By BILL SLEDGE
Coach Pete Whittle’s cross country team will still be look-
ing for their first win of the season again this afternoon against
Washington @ Lee over the rugged 4-mile grind here at Davidson.

Very little is known about the
Generals’ team this fall, but last
year the Wildcats beat them 16-44,
and hope to do a repeat perform-
ance again this year for the first
victory of the ‘52 season.

The junior varsity harriers also
have a meet today—their first of
the year—with Pfieffer Junior
College here at Davidson. They
are expected to win over the less
experienced Pfieffer harriers.

Last Saturday the varsity lost
a close one to the University of
Richmond by the score of 35-23.
It was an upset as the Wildcats
were predicted to win easily. Coach
Whittle said the boys ran a good

race, but Bob Henry, captain of
the team, got sick during the race,
and was forced to fall way behind.
This made quite a difference in the
score and outcome of the meet.

Running for the varsity today
are the following men: Bob Henry,
Steve Gooding, Floyd Feeney, Bill
Shipley, Bitt Russell, Andy Tur-
ner, Joe Carpenter, and Homer
Sparks.

Representing Davidson for the
junior varsity are: Archie Joyner,
Hershet Allen, Joe Caudell, Stuart
Plummer, J. C. Eagle, Jr., Don
Stewart, J. V. Howell, Jr. and
J. H. McKeithan.

The big question
- which the denizens of
Hugo’s, the MGM, and
the Broken Anchor will
be asking tonight is not
primarily whether the
Cats can win their
second game of the '52
season tomorrow. The
. real question is wheth-
er Davidson can shake
off the Homecoming
jinx which has been
, plaguing them since
1941.

Bill Dole’s team
isn’t in the best shape
to whip the powerful
Furman club. But at least they ought to have a little more con-
fidence in themselves since they beat Presbyterian last Friday
night. ‘

Johnny Gray, who is usually about as talkative as a cigar-
store Indian, may have summed up the Cats’ feelings earlier
this week. ‘‘We're gonna beat ‘em,”” said the Statesville speedster
simply. And he meant it, too.

But the simple fact of the matter is that Davidson will
have to play heads-up ball every minute tomorrow afternoon.
They can’t be a first-half ball club and whip Furman. The boys
from down Greenville way are no pushovers in anybody's
league, and Dole’s crippled team is going to have trouble all the
way.

By DICK ROPER

As this reporter has said before, nobody—Old Grads,
students, or any other Davidson fans—will blame the Cats
if they play a hard ball game and lose. What makes the
fans vow they'll never see another Davidson game is some
of the sorry tackling, poor blocking, and generally shoddy
ball playing that the Cats have shown at times.

Nobody will dispyte, however, that the Cats looked good
down at Clinton last week. Jimmy Thacker and Leroy Far-
gason sparked an attack good for 273 yards, and most of the
time the center of the Cat line held up pretty well.

Pass defense is where’ Dole’s men showed up worse than
anywhere else. In the closing moments of the game PC looked
like a sure bet to close the gap between Davidson's 13 and their
own 12 points. That same weakness can make or break them
tomorrow. Furman's got a quarterback, name of Pedrick, who
is plenty capable of slinging ‘em, and they've also got a fresh-
man in that position who was their hero in their upset of West
Virginia a few weeks ago. ‘

It’s probably a good thing that the football game
isn't the only feature of a Homecoming weekend, because
a loss at that puts a damper on spirits pretty well if there's
nothing else to do. But those faithful souls whom we call
the Old Grads must go home a little sadder every year
Davidson loses on that occasion, because many of them can
cemember back when Davidson beat the big boys without a
whole lot of trouble.

But they keep coming back, and that must mean some-
thing. Maybe it’s just love of the game. maybe they just like
to look over the campus as it grows, maybe they just like to
notice how much younger the freshmen seem to be getting
every year. But it does seem that they are due to be shown a
good hard football game.

Cats Must Shake Off 11-Year Jinx

To Win Tomorrow's Homecoming Tilt

By DICK LILES
Tomorrow's ‘game with Furman
is no different than most of the
games that the Cats play. They're
decidedly the underdogs as usual.
There is, however, a uniqueness to

‘this game

that may have been
overlooked in the  pre-festivitics
rush. It is Homecoming, and a Da-
vidson football team hasn't won
one of these jinxed games in
eleven years,

Down in Clinton, S. C., Presby-
terian’s Blue Hose are saying that
Stanley Woodward, national foot-
ball authority, knew exactly what
he was talking about when he
picked Davidson’s Jimmy Thack-
er to be one of the South's finest
halfbacks for 1952.

“It was Thacker who scored both
of the Wildcat’s touchdowns as the

Indeed, it was a bleak November
day when the Cats annexed their
last homecoming victory. It was
in 1940 when teams were pretty
good up here on the hill. The
defeated team was the Presbyte-
rian aggregation from Centre Col-
lege, the famous “Praying Colo-
nels,” and the score was 27-12, The
year before the Wildcats had
downed Citadel by 22-14 and before
that had nearly broken even on
this gala occasion,

Jinx Was On

But then it all fell through and

not a team since has been able

[to break the jinx that the “Pray-
~}ing Colonels” evidently wished on

Davidson. Only once or twice have
the boys come close. Against
VMI in 1947, they managed a tie,
14-14, with the strong Keydets.
Then came last year’s heart-
breaker 14-12 score against
“Presbyterian College: That
game proved that there must be
something about Homecoming
at Davidson that keeps the
Cats from winning, because
they ran over the Blue Hose
all day, but couldn’t score and
kick the PAT’s.
In 1948 a strong Davidson team
composed of Bill Storey’s main-
stays Mapes, Carnegie, Pahl, Rich-

Back in the spotlight

No homecoming was held during
1944 and 1945, so ‘really the Cats
have, only lost 9 games over a
span of 11 years. The games were

Sigs Remain Undeleated, Pikas Move Up
As Interfrat Race Nears Half-Way Mark

By JOHN HANDLEY

The scramble for the interfra-
ternity football crown this week
brings three new names up into the
high positions. Though there are
new teams near the top, the Sigma
Chi squad tops the list as their
attack seems to pick up added
steam with every game.

The undefeated Sigs poured it
on their two opponents this week
in piling up a total of 80 points
over the KAs and the ATOs. In
Monday’s action the Sigs trounced
the defending champion KAs by a
31-6 count and on Wetinesday they
piled up the biggest score of the
season in defeating the cellar-
dwelling ATOs 49-31.

Sigma Chie 31; KAs 6

The sparkling backfield per-
formances of Tyler Berry and Bob
Mitchell coupled with the fine play
of Buz Hope and Bert Downs
brought the front-running Sigma
Chis a 31-6 victory over the sag-
ging KAs, The KAs were led by
T. W. Aldred and Lefty Vance.

Pikas 13; KAs 7
Again led by the fine play-hand-
