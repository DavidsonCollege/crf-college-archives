Last weekend, ten Davidson students

learned to love spandex—and not just be- °

cause of its stylishness.

During the day, the material madé hours on
a bike seat a more pleasant experience, and at
night, its fibers warmed the sleeping riders.
As one participant expressed, “spandex
gooooo0o0o000d.”

Over the weekend, the group, organized by
Davidson Out- '
doors and led by
Bruce Bell ’00
and Christina
Cooke 03,
cycled the 57
mile New River
Trail through the
mountains of
southern Vir-
ginia. The New
River Trail is part
of a national net-
work of: railroad
tracks that have
been converted to
public hiking,
biking, and
horseback riding
trails.
As the riders followed the trail along the
river through the valley, they traversed many
faces of the Virginian countryside. They
passed by pastures of chewing cows and
houses with wide porches and tinroofs. They

passed through arbors of arching tree branches
and tunnels carved through rocks.

Numerous times, the riders crossed wooden
bridges that led from one bank of the river to
the other. From the middle of these bridges,
far above the water, they often dismounted to
admire the view that stretched miles in both
directions.

“It’s nice to know that you’ve seen a new
stretch of America and that you’re familiar
with another area,” says Matt Dixon ‘03.

The trail was smooth and wide enough that
we could all ride
two abreast com-
fortably and not
worry about
spilling on the
trail,” remem-
bers Bell. Thus,
as riders pedaled,
they could dis-
cuss everything
from last
semester’s
classes to the
newest models
of “fertility
friendly” bike
seats. “It’s al-
ways fun to get
out there with

“T think everyone got along very well and
genuinely cared about everyone’s experi-
ence. Everyone was quick to help each other
out,” continues Bell.

Delilahs record rookie effort

The Delilahs, one of Davidson’s three a
capella groups, their first recently finished
recording their first CD.

Recorded by Andrew Gilliland from Hy-

peractive Studios, the girls had a great time ~

doing it, according to Ida

- Wainschel ’01. “I was

really pleaséd with the

way we handled our-
selves.” she added.

_ Hyperactive happens
to be the studio that re-
corded Cast Iron Filter, a
popular Davidson band.

The process of record=
ing is not an easy one for
any group. According to
Wainschel, the Generals

trouble with all of the le-
galities of the process.
The Generals have yet to
get their copyrights.

Wainschel wanted the
Generals experience to be
one that the Delilahs
‘learned from, and they
did. Wainschel says that
the group has almost all
of their copyrights in
place.

The Delilahs plan to
‘hold their next concert

. ' WEDNEsDay,
NOVEMBER 8, 2000

Students enjoyed the fall scenery ¢ on the trail | through the Christina Cooke

southern Virginia countryside.

As the sun set on the first day, the riders
found themselves still several miles from
their campsite and the van full of gear. In the
darkness, they became more prone to en-
counter what Tiffany Lautensleger ’02 de-
scribes as the “unpredictable squish of large
mounds of horse poo,” which they had been

able to dodge in the daylight. Fortunately,

they reached their campground without any
casualties.

After setting up camp on the banks of the
New River, the riders sautéed veggies on the
stove. for fajitas and roasted marshmallows

around a campfire for s’mores. Afterwards,

all gravitated towards the tents.

“My fave part of the day was getting into
the sleeping bag in my toasty synthetic ap-
parel and then actually getting the full 8
hours,” declared Lautensleger.

When the group arose.in the morning and
saw. their location for the first time in the
daylight, Bell realized that, “Our campsite
couldn’t have been better. I woke up toa view

of cliffs across the river reddening as the sun
rose.”

The group pedaled 19 miles on the second
day before pulling into the final town, down-
ing tuna sandwiches, and collapsing on the
lawn in the sun to wait for the shuttle to return
them to the van.

“T think it’s great to get some distance from
this crazy place called Davidson College and
to rekindle the senses that have little rel-
evance to life here on campus,” muses Bell.
“More importantly, I think it’s a great excuse
to spend.real time getting to know people
better. I think all this is enhanced when a
sense of achievement is mutual, regardless of
the goal.”

On these trips, adds D.O. Director Ed
Daugherty, “You get to spend time with people
you may not have known before, doing some-
thing you may not have done before, in a
place you may not have been before.”

And you can do all of these things, as a
participant says, “whilst getting real buff.”
