Campus Crime and Davidson

Campus Crime Washes

Over Nationwide Campuses

By B.J. HOEPTER

(CPS)- A student, is found
strangled in his dorm room at Lock
Haven University in Pennsylva-
nia.

Student editors return to their

-office at Bridgewater State Col-
lege in Massachuesctts one day in
September to find $23,000 in
computer equipment stolen.

At about th same time, police
arrest four Delaware State College
students, charging them with the
gang rape of a nearby resident.

A student at State University
of New York at Buffalo is found
raped and strangled on Sept. 30.

Such scenes, observers say,
have unfolded atan unusually high
number and broad range of cam-
puses this fall as something of a
crime wave scems to be washing
over American higher education:

“College campuses are just
seething with crime,” said Dr. Alan
Lizotte, associate dean of crimi-
nology at the State University of
New York (SUNY) at Albany.
“They’re horrible places.”

“A lot of students are scared,”
added Rob Tumney, an Ohio State
University scnior who heads the
school’s Crime Watch Escort Serv-
icc. “They don’t go out alone.”

The fear has turned into wild
rumors alsome campuses. Admin-
istrators at Iowa State University
spent the first weck of October
trying to convince students that
there was not a scrial rapist on
campus.

But the crime threats are real.

While campus crime statistics
arc notoriously unreliable, Purdue,
Yale and Loyola of New Orlcans
universities as well as the universi-
tics of Colorado at Boulder and
California at Santa Barabara all
report an increase in crime during
the past year.

dent skittishness, of course, stems
from the brutal late-August-mur-
ders of one Santa Fe Community
College student and four Univer-
sity of Florida students.

While police still search for
clues and someone to charge with
the slayings, the tragedy made the
subject of campus crime more
visible than ever. Recent storics on
the*Oprah Winfrey Show, Good
Morning America, ABC News and
in USA Today have fanned the
flames.

In truth, campus crime was
gettin so prevalent in 1988 that an

Marquette, Millersville State,

sities.

Pleas for better protection from
criminals were central parts of
protests at Tennessce State Uni-
versity, Morgan State University,
Paine College in Georgia, Ma-
rygrove College in Michigan and
the University of South Carolina
during the 1989-90 school year.

“It’s hard to know whether (the
amount of ) crime is going up or
whether the appearance of crime is
going up,” says Lizotte.

Students may have been living
in the midst of such dangers for
years. The difference is that now
they know about it.

Lizotte noted it has become

moreacceptable for campus news-
papers to report crimes, especially
“sensitive” crimes such as rape,
creating an illusion of an increase.

Student papers like The Stan-
dard at Southwest Missouri State
University have had to sue to fain
access to crime reports from ad-
ministrators concerned about pri-
vacy and publicity issues.

Crime “articles have created a
sense of anxicly on campus among
students and employees,” said
Michacl P. Riccards, president of
Shepherd Collegein West Virginia,
in denouncing the student newspa-
per Oct. 5 for publishing stories
detailing a Shepherd student’s rape.

“T don’t see it (campus crime)
increasing any more than it has in
society in general,” said John Car-
penter, public safety director at
San Diego State University. “We
can’t get away from what’s hap-
pening around us.”

Even the perception of acrime
wave this term can beexplained by

“a seasonal shift, said Lt. Brenda

King of Purdue University, where
most crimes tend to occur in the
fall.

Purdue police received 108
personal property theft reports in
Septemberalone, compared to 426
during the first six months of 1990.
“People are new and glad to to
be back” during’ fall term, and may
overextend their new sense of free-
dom by victimizing their class-
mates,” King speculated.

SUNY’s Lizotte sagreed there
has been an increase in personal
thefts at campuses in the past 20
years.

It may be beculise students
these ‘days tend to have so many
expensive, portable and stealable
belongings these days.

“In 1950, if you’d wanted to
steal a television you’d nced three
men and a truck,” Lizotte said.
“Today you’ ve got laptop comput-

- According to a Campus Po-
licerelease, the overall crime rate
at Davidson College has dropped
compared to last year, but the
rate of bicycle larcenics has
marked a substantial gain.

‘The release lists seven ways
to prevent bicycle theft on the

The problem is made worst
since students often have trusting
natures which keep them from

Lizotte said. With the crime wave
has come more elaborate security
measures.

University of St. Louis police
have started using metal scanners

to search students at school dances.
At Mankato State University, new
security cameras are trained on
campus parking lots to catch

thieves < and vandals: The Univer-
