“This certainly is a satisfying
victory,’’ said Coach Harry Fo

the time.”

Earlier in the week, the ‘Cat
netmen presented Fogleman
with the 300th victory of his 22-
year tennis coaching career
when they defeated a surpris-
ingly tough East Stroudsburg
team, 6.3.

Phelps and Hearon provided
the winning point with their
doubles victory.

‘We're happy we could be the
team that gave Coach Fogle-
man this victory,’’ said Hatch-

lustrious career, and this mile-
stone of 300 victories is an indi-
cation of his success.”

The netmen currently have a
9-1 record with four of the vic-
tories coming during the spring |

But the Tech bats were again
too much as they got twelve
hits and nine runs. The ‘Cats
had five miscues in the field.
Hank Strickland had two hits

the “Jackets won, 9-0.

SPLIT WITH INDIANS

Returning to the friendly con-
fines. of Davidson Tuesdav. the
diamondmen split a doublehead-
er with William and Mary’s In-
dians in conference action.

In. the first game. Durham
threw a six-hitter al the visitors
but the ‘Cats could not muster
a plate attack and they fell.

‘Cat hits were by Murphy.
Strickland, Smith. Waite, and
Logan. whose first-inning triple
scored the only run.

The second game saw David-
son pull out a 4-2 victory for Ben-
nett. After jumping off to a 2-1
lead in the first innings, the
‘Cats were tied 2-2 after the
opening rounds. .Then Smith
came through with RBI's in the
third and fifth innings and put
the game on ice. Smith. along
with Lindsey. Logan, and Waite
had the other ‘Cat hits.

The team’s conference record
stands at 2-2 and their overall
record is 3-7.

The diamondmen play their
third conference doubleheader
tomorrow against VMI at Lex
ington. Va. The Keydets, Stevens
said, have been plagued with
lack of personnel this yeat, and
should not prove to be as strong
as some of this year's competi
tion.

Davidson will face Belmont
Abbey there on Tuesday. and
will play a doubleheader with
Richmond next Saturday on the
Spiders’ home field
