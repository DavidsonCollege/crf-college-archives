WITH OTHER COLLEGES,

University of Virginia—For three
successive years the Rhoées Scholarship
for Virginia has been won by a member
of the University of Virginia foot ball
team. It was won this year by George
W. Anderson, a member of the class of
1916 in the academic department, and
for the past two years a tackle on the
foot ball eleven. He is president of his
class.

‘The enrollment at Virginia now totals
1,033. the largest in the history of the
University,

VV. M. 1.—The board of visitors of
the Virginia Military Institute recently
gave the following summarized report
as to the death of Cadet Sweet, who by
some wis supposed to have met his death
by hazing: “Phat the death of Cadet
Thurber Sweet from myelitis was in no
way induced by any hazing or injury of
any kind received by him while at the
Institute, or from any cadet or person
connected therewith.”

The incident has caused a more rigid
enforcement of the rules in regard to
hazing.

” * *

Winthrop—The board of trustees of
Winthrop have decided to ask the Leg-
islature of South Carolina to provide a
new dormitory in order to accommodate
the large number of young women of the
State who now desire to matriculate at
Winthrop. A new dormitory, accommo-
dating 250 or 300 students, would make
it possible for the enrollment to reach
1,200.

DAVIDSON VITAL STATISTICS
REPORT FOR THE YEAR ro15

‘Total number of deaths, 14. Pneu-
monia, 2; Pellagra, 33. Apoplexy, 2;
Cancer, 1; Pyelitis, 1; Septicaemina, 1;
Mal-nutrition, 1 (one month old);
Dead at birth, 3. Total. 14. Births
during the year, 31.

For 1914: Deaths, 23; Births. 50.

A most interesting feature of the 1915
report, apart, from the wonderful reduc-
tion from 23 to 14 deaths, is that be-
tween the ages of one month and 27
years, there was no mortality, and no
deaths from diseases that might be con-
sidered as preventable by community
action.
