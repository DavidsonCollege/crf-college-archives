From The President

One of the actions taken by the Trustees at
their recent semi-annual meeting was to “authorize
inistration to require the auditing of all
g handled in behalf of all organiza-
businesges connected with the college.”
eans that any department of the college,
er administrative or not, including all or-
vations which have treasuries and handle
will be expected to submit their books
t cally for careful audit. It will insure a
slearer and more business-like handling of all
funds of all departments of the collegé, adminis-
trative, faculty and student.

Another action taken was to increase the
health service and physical education fee to $40
per student per year. The cost of this service to
the college has increasedsso greatly within the
last decade that student fees are providing less
than a third of the actual cost of the students for
this service. It is the opinion of the administra-
tion that from instructional costs which
never can be borne by student tuition, other
auxiliary enterprises in the college should ap-
proach more nearly the point Where they carry
themselves.

Elections Coming Up.
Spring brings many elements into
campus life, notable among them spring fever,
thoughts of love, impending term papers, and
plans to squeeze in a couple-of extra weeks
at the beach this summer. One of the most
important things that happen in the student
body in the spring is the studentbodyclee—
tions.
The. elections begin shortly after, Spring
Holidays and last almost a month. Officers
to be chosen will be the presidents of the stu-
dent body and the Y, the editors of the three
publications, the remaining student body of-
ficers, the class officers, and the student
council members.
In these days’ of a large enrollment. we
have a problem that we didn’t have when the
student’ body numbered six hundred or legs.

_FEATUR

ES

Our elections system was set up to suit a
group in which every student knew most of
his fellow students. At least, he would know
almost any man prominent enough to be
nominated for a student body office.

Under the system of elections set up by
our constitution, there is no campaigning,
no promises, no influencing of votes —in
short, no politicing. The Davidson tradition
is that a man is elected on the basis of ability
and personal record, This is our ideal. It has
worked in the past and should be workable
still.

.. However, the size of the student body has
increased so much in the past three years that
it is well-nigh impossible for a student to
know personally each man who.may be nomi-
nated for an ofice. Hf our ideal is to continue
to work in praetice, it will take some effort
on the part of each man to learn something
about the men who are qualified for the dif-
ferent Jobs so that our choices can still be
made intelligently and without polities.

Now is the time for every student to start
thinking about the men who are best quali-
fied to hold office. That way, we won't be
caught on election day asking who half the
men on the ballet are.

When Do We Want It?

As we vo to press, the attainment of the
Student Body Campaign Drive is virtually, if
not absolutely, assured. The student body is
to be highly commended on a job well done.
Of course, there is a good chance of our going
Way over the top and we would not want to
congratulate any body into slowing down.

The race having been won the cake is to
be eaten, and it is up to the student body
how it is to be eaten. The student body, we
are told, is to decide when the holiday-prize
is to be taken, The concensus of opinion
seems to be that the Spring Holidays will be
the best time. We don’t recall any vote hav-
ing been taken, but the powers that be seem
to be working on that assumption.

Spring holidays seem to be the best time
from the point of view, particularly, of stu-
dents who live a long way from Davidson, If
it is a 24-hour train trip home and the same
back, the extra day then would mean a lot to
some boys who might not get to go -home
otherwise. On the other hand, some week-
end might suit most of the students better:

It the have
pitched in and raised the money and it ought
surely to be their decision as mueh as possi-
ble when the holiday will be. :

Carl Pahl tells us that he is working on the
possibility of havine the double-eut regula-
tion suspended after the added holiday if
our goal reaches as high as 150 per cent.

is students themselves iwho

Then, too, there is the goud hope of an added
holiday if we get 200 per cent. So let’s keep
the ball rolling, and show these people how

to raise some money.

Hospitality

{

It has been called to our attention that
Visitors on the campus, parents and frieyds
of students, have no very good way of locat-
ing boys they want to tind without the, co-
operation of us students. Of course, they can
find a student directory in the Guest Honse
and probably some detailed instruetions of
how to get there after they know where they
are going. But most of them would not know
about that.

Chances are, they'll ask some student pass-
ing by if he knows*‘my boy Bill” and where
he is at the moment. It may take a moment
of our sometimes important time to be court-
eous and helpful to these visitors, but aetual-
lywe will be doing the school and also our-
selves a favor by a good turn of that kind.

One mark of a Christian, edueated man
should be his courtesy and hospitality. One
mark of a Davidson man TS his ¢ourtesy and
hospitality.

The House Un-American Activities Com-
mittee has decided to shun publicity. That’s
un-American in itself.
