THE DAVIDSONIAN

Question |Camera Club Hears |

fie Week | Lecture by Dr. Lyon

Due to the coming elections, ‘the
question of the virtues and faults
of the political system has arisen.
In order to get a cross section of
student opinion the, following. ques-
tion was put to the following Sen
iors: Do you think a better system
of politics can be evolved fot Da-
vidson’s elections or is the old sys-
tem satisfactory?

Charley Yates:

I don't

tem, as [ am heartily

approve .of the old. sys-

in favor of
open politics. Something definitely
when

wrong year year
there is disputing, protesting and
rerunning of elections. There is

always some few that wish to com-
bine forces and ruin the purpose of
closed politics.
Ross. Gladden:
I think that

officers

present system

of could be im-
proved, For instance, the balloting
system is not adequate for getting
accurate of the votes
cast. If this could worked out
it seems to me it would help the
Council in counting the votes, and

also be beneficial in other ways.

George Ficklen:

The old system of politics has
some advantages, but | think it
disadvantages outweigh these. <A

system of “open” politics would at
least bring the evils to light so that
these evils could be removed. If
the “open” system did not work
after a thorough trial, it could be
replaced with the old system.
Tom McKnight:

As to the matter of “open poli-
tics’ I think it has no place on
the Davidson for it can
lead to much competition and cause
friction groups. I’m for
the old system as the merits of our
leaders show themselves vivid e-
nough for all practical purposes.

Dick G mmon:

I am rather inclined to believe
that our present system of politics
is as good as any method that will

f Davidson, It seems that in
nwst cases the men we have chosen
as our leaders have proven compet-
ent, and as long as we don't go
to the point of “combines” or vote
for a man merely because he is
a “fraternity brother”, we will be
treading on firm soil.

Loch Hunter:

Politics are corrupt, and will con-
tinue in that way as long as elec-
tions are held. A new system could
in no way be worse. So let a man
for once..ina while. in Dayidson
fight his own battle—I am definite-
ly in favor of open politics.

Sie

Russell Edmondson:

The old system of politics at Da-
vidson is not a good one and will
never be. There will always be
some who will violate the old sys-
tem by forming combines, and thus
keep some deserving candidate
from being elected. I think we
should have open politics so as
to give everyone a fair chance. It
might also help us to develop some
good future politicians.

Billy Masters:

Certainly the old system of poli-
tics can be improved. A change in
the balloting system would be. a
great ‘help, but that is not enough.
That will not eliminate the under-
current of political maneuvers by
any means. Certainly politics will
keep on, no matter what precau-
tions are taken, The Seniors have
seen it for the last three years, and
there is every reason to believe it
will continue if the present system
is adhered to, It might be surpris-
ing, also, to some of us if we knew
who some of our “Davidson gentle-
men” are who have taken not only
a part but a leading role. Isn't
open politics better than dirty poli-
tics?

Jim Anderson:

We will have dirty politics and
combines here at Davidson as long
as we have closed politics. During
the elections here now we pledge
ourselves not to. enter into. any
combines during any campus elec-
tions. These combines, however,
still exist and always will as long
as_politics here remains as it is at
present. So why not have open poli-
tics ?

Daniel Gilliam:

The old system is better than
this idea of “open politics.’ The old
system, although imperfect, is be-
ing improved. If we have this idea
of “open politics” it will divide the
college into two or three groups
that will openly work against each
other. This will be detrimental to
our college spirit which needs unity
in the student body above all things.
Davidson is too small for “open
politics.” :
