New Schedule

Is Announced

Chapel Period Changed; More
Time Given Between

A new daily schedule went into
effect on last Monday in order that
the regular college classes{ and
those for the air corps cadets may
be worked out concurrently,
Last week the schedule was
moved up a half hour from that
followed during the winter months.
It was planned at the time to work
out the cadets’ schedule in ac-
cordance with the regular schedule.
However numerous conflicts and
confusion about the bells made the
new changes necessary.

Ten Minutes
First period now begins at 8:30
with the first bell ringing at 8:20.
First bell for each class will ring
at twenty minutes past the hour,
with the tardy buzzer coming at
half past. This leaves ten minutes
for students to change as compared
with five minutes allowed by the
old schedule.
The chapel period now comes at

12:20, immediately after fourth
period, with ‘dinner following at
12:45.

Jim McCrary
Leads Service

The World Day of Prayer, which
is observed by churches universally,
comes this year on Friday, March
12. Started by women of the South-
ern Presbyterian Church in 1887, it
has spread rapidly ‘since then.

On the program in Chapel Friday
morning, Jim McCrary, Presidént
of the Y, will preside, explaining the
meaning of the World Day of
Prayer. The Scripture will be read
by Rev. Carl R. Pritchett, pastor
ofthe’ Davidson church, and will
be followed by a prayer led by
Professor Beaty.

Upperclassmen will remember that
last year there was an extended
chapel at which Miss Katherine
Smith of New York was the speak-
er. This year, because of Spring
Services the three preceding
days, Friday’s chapel will be limit-
ed simply to a prayer service in
which the Davidson community is
cordially invited to participate.

Biologist Speaks On Advances
In Science .

br. Lote Gray, eminent research
biologist, stirred the student body
into thought early this week with
his information on recent advances
in the field of science.

“The most important develop-
ments of this generation will prob-
ably be the use of the energy from
Uranium and the transmi ssion of
power by radio,” said Dr. Gray to
a small group of students. “It
usually takes a generation to de-
velop something after it has been
made available. One generation
made petroleum available and the
next developed the engines to em-
ploy it. The same thing should hap-
pen with Uranium.

“Transmission of power. by, radio
will take away the network of
wires over the country. All you will
have to do is put up a big antenna
and hook your lights to it.”

Dr. Gray gave his chief address
on “The Place of Pure Research in
the Community.” In this he outlined
the progress. of civilization from
the earliest days. Different types of
thought followed separate routes
through the ages to reach modern
times.

Rockefeller Foundation first
brought Dr. Gray to the United
States from England, his native

country. Since then he has decided
to remain in this country and is
now employed as a research special-
ist in biology by the University of
Pittsburgh.

During one of Dr. Gray's many
talks he happened to mention that
American college education demands
too much production and not enough
real education. When asked later to
comment on this statement, he
said, “The students come to college
to get grades and not to get an edu-
cation.”

A student then said, “I would
like to work more on getting an

education and get poorer grades,

Air Cadets

“Wings for Offense” and
“Bombs and Bombing”
Among New Books
Davidson's Library has recently
added volumes to. its
shelves pertain to military

aviation.

The books are now on the shelves
and open to the student body and
also the new group of aviation ca-
dets taking their pre-flight training
here. With the arrival of the new
group to Davidson, there came an
increased interest in military avia-
tion and it was with this in mind
that the new books were obtained.

First in this group is Army Fly-
Lieutenant General H. H.
Arnold and Major General Ira C.
Eaker. The main subject of the
book is military aviation as a ca-
reer, from aviation cadet to air gen-
eral,

Another in this series of writings
is Wings For Offense by Captain
Surr W. Leyson. This new volume
supplemented with exceptional
photographs and contains up to the
ifiinute information on-air tactics.

Other Books

Bombs and Bombing is also one of
the current editions on hand. The
book was written by Wiley Ley, and
contains information that should be
known by all civilians. It explains
all of the various types of bombs
and explosives used in warfare, and
tells how the various air attacks
are carried out.

Major Bernard A. Law’s book,
Fighting Planes of the World, is
also present. This volume contains
twenty-seven full color illustrations
of the various countries’ planes. It
also gives interesting information
about the planes.

Last in the group of new editions
is The Command of the Air by
Guilio Douhet, a foreigner. Douhet
had expressed views concerning the
of great aerial wars as
early as the first part of this cen-
tury and these with other viewpoints
are expressed in this book.
