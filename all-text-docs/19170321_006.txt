SOPH FOOTBALL “FEED.”

The Sophomore football squad held
its annual “feed” in the Social Center
last Friday night. The feed was some
later than the other teams’ owing to
the fact that several members of the
squad have been “off the Hill.” The
members of the squad present were:
Captain Johnston, Clarke, McAskill,
Boswell, Worth, “Dub” Johnson,
Knight, Poole, White, Robson, Alex-
ander, Faires, Currie, Miller, Howell
and Menzies. An abundance of eats
had been secured by Manager Burns,
and the players were fully rewarded
for their hard work. After the feed all
present were entertained with a demon-
stration by Alexander on “The correct
way to smoke a cigar.” Just before dis-
persing, the squad gave “155” for ‘19.

“DON'TS.”

(Continued from last week)

19. Don’t separate an auxiliary verb
from its verb or participle unless you are
using more than one auxiliary with one
verb, Do not say “This should never
happen,” altho it is true. “This never
should happen” is equally true and is
also correct. But you may say “This
should never have happened,” if you like
it better than “This never should have
happened.”

20. .Don’t forget that skipping about
from tense to tense—commingling past.
present, and future—in one time and
paragraph, has not even a Bergsonian
justification. It is blasphemous, un-
grammatical and annoying.

21. Don’t forget that a sentence into
which you have put more than __ fifty
words is probably awkward and unclear.

22. Don’t fail after you have writ-
ten a sentence. to look it over and trans-
late it into ideas (if you can), and de-
cide whether or not it tells the reader
anythine.

23. Don’t fail to go over paragraph<

words. A good writer takes a-hint from
a good gardener.

24. Don’t think that atrocities are
pardonable and may be imitated if they
are committed in books written by Pres-
idents of the United States who are
known as “stylists” or “authors.” Abra-
ham Lincoln would have said something
brief and appropriate about “stylists” if
he had been called one. He wrote be-
cause he had something to say and want-
ed to be understood. A good writer ad-
dresses persons who have to compre-
hend, to decide and to act. “Stylists”
write for publishers, posterity and Cha-
tauqua circles.

25. Don’t believe that “up-to-date”
American school teachers, college pro-
fessors and “educators,” with occasional
exceptions, know how to use the English
language. ‘They don’t. If you want to
learn to write well, ransack garrets and
old book shops for grammars and text-
books of rhetoric that were published be-
fore 1875, and study them diligently.

students, self government, activities and
everything else. ‘Ihe real truth of the
matter is that if student government i:
to exist it must be complemented by th.

Faculty. After all, should the studem
body decided whether or not hazing o1
drinking will take place here? . Arc

there not certain laws which young men
should obey even tho they do rebel:
And can that be done unless the Faculty
is the ultimate source of power? Thi:
is usually a true situation, The Faculty
actually does back up the council. But
there is friction because its power to dc
so is not formally recognized. Thi:
recognition should be made and put in
the constitution,

In the second place, each individual
student should feel his own personal re-
sponsibility to report cases to the coun-
cil. This is the base rock of the Honor
System. Remove it and the whole
scheme will collapse.

In the third place, our Moral Code
must be revised completely. The fram-
ers of the present code believed that it
should. be made indefinite so that each
council should be able to exercise its own
opinion. Ta a monarchy that would be
an admirable scheme. In one council
where there are fifteen men each with a
different idea, it simply will not work.
Any one who has been a member of the
council will testify to that fact. Some-
times the council spends five and six
hours trying to come to a decision as to
where it stands on a case—discussing,
for instance, “What is repeated drunk-
enness.” In the Moral Code there
should be certain prescribed laws with
certain prescribed penalties. In some
way a new system should be devised so
that students and councilmen would
