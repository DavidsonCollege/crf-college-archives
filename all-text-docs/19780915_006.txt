Professors’ wives

There’s an old saying about
college professors and their
wives: the professors are dis-
gentle pillars of support. Just
as professors have become
much more visible and access-
ible -their wives have also
branched out, leaving their
talent and enthusiasm to com-
munity activities and to their
own careers.

Susan Abbott, wife of Dr.
Tony Abbott of the English
department, is presently in-
volved with framing and. other

Captain Patton speculated
that the cross country area was
used during or prior to World
War II as a training area for the

shouldn’t have picked up the
shell, “They said I was crazy to
bring it into a residential area

“You can’t just assume these
things are dead.”
Captain Patton explained the

aspects of art at the Copeland
House Gallery. Abbott was
originally a clerk for the Village
Store. Five years ago when they

Kello also teaches two short
courses in drama to classes of
the schools which the company
visits. She stressed that em-
phasis is not on drama as an art
form but as a way of getting the
kids to “‘communicate their own
creative feelings.” This is pri-
marily accomplished through
pantomime which, Kello poin-
ted out, kids do often.

Debbie Webster, the wife of
_ psychology professor Dr. Tim
Webster, also has-a Master’s
Degree in the field. She recently
began a job as a school psychol-
ogist and visits four schools in
the Davidson area. Webster
explained her role as that of a

Webster also said “‘it’s always a

challenge to find the best way to
help the kids’’ and personally
tries the simplest solution first:
She concluded that her job as a
school psychologist is very di-
verse and “depends upon the
needs of the school.”

Another busy Davidson wife
is Ann Retzer, wife of a political
science professor. She originally
worked at, UNCC as the assis-
tant coordinator of Extension
and Continuing Education.
This support service for faculty
and students is meant to extend
off-campus studies for credit
and non-credit courses. One of
Retzer’s present activities is

band, in the cooperative ‘‘Chil-
