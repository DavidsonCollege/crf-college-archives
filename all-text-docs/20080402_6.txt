Trustees Renege on Debt Free Promise

According to a perky email from
President Ross’s _ secretary,

| Davidson students will no longer

be guaranteed to graduate debt-
free.

The email cited numerous rea-
sons why the college would again
have to resort to student loans,
among them a poor economy, the
ongoing war in Iraq, the financial
burden of providing students with a
quasi-free laundry service and a

| few bad nights in Vegas involving
| roulette and the school’s endow-
| ment.

But the biggest reason for the
debt-free fiasco was undoubtedly
the massive and totally unexpected
student response to the promise.

“We thought maybe a few dozen
would take us up on the offer,” said
Chairman of the Board of Trustees
Skip Kingsley ’62, who admitted

| that the debt-free dream, born in

the inebriated minds of several fan-
ciful trustees then drinking at the
Brickhouse, had been tenuous and
half-baked.

“We never thought about how it
would affect tuition, or the smol-
dering remnants of our endow-

ment, or my ability to retire to
Palm Beach,” Kingsley said.

President Ross, via his secretary,
took pains to remind the student
body of the trustees’ generosity and
noble intentions.

He also stressed that students
who did not get a seat on one of
the seven buses out of debt should
immediately email his secretary,
who would place them on the wait-
list.

Admissions Director Looks Forward to
Rejecting More Applications

In the aftermath of the men's
basketball team's historic run
through the NCAA tournament, the
Admissions Department expects a
significant spike in the number of
applications to Davidson.

Despite high marks in the do-or-
die rankings of the prestigious US.
News and World Report, Davidson
has still failed to truly establish
itself in the nation's conscience.
Until now.

For a school that prides itself on
its already low admission rate, the
added attention couldn't be sweet-
er.

“We are certain that all of this
media coverage will cause the
number of applications to rise,”
said Admissions director Julie
Abrams. “And that, of course,
means we get to reject more appli-
cants.”

Abrams said that the extra appli-
cations have already started pour-
ing in. “I've never seen the office
this crazy,” she said. “Our whole
team just can't wait to get started

on rejecting these kids.”

Until the last few weeks,
Davidson has relied primarily on a
staunch word-of-mouth advertising
policy. Now, high school seniors
can pick up a USA Today and read
about Davidson nearly every day.

“All of these kids who never
would have heard about Davidson,
they're the ones I'm truly excited
for. Thanks to the basketball team,
so many more kids have the oppor-
tunity to be rejected.”

Though the Admissions
Department has already sent out
several hundred rejection letters,
they've got a long way to go. “If
we keep up a pace of rejecting
around 100 kids a day, we'll still be
working hard well into the month
of May.

“This is why I come to work
every day,” Abrams _ said..
“Rejecting kids is the best part of
my job, and now I get to do it a
whole lot more. It's a great day to
be a Wildcat.”

It is unclear whether those stu-

any impecunious student willing to

half-century.

Area Man Announces Plan to Turn Boxers
Inside-Out, Wear Them Again

Local comicbook store employ-
ee Raymond Polanski shocked
friends and family on Friday after-
noon when he announced a revolu-
tionary new money-saving scheme.

Polanski, who has held the same
position as sales associate at
Cornelius Comics.for seven years,
says he rarely engages in the mini-
mal amount of physical activity
required for a human body to per-
spire. Therefore, he plans to
stretch his laundry rotation twice as
far as its ever gone before.

By turning his undies inside-out
and wearing them again the next
day, Polanski will get twice the
mileage he used to from each pair
of drawers.

Undressing before bed last week,
Polanski noticed his johns “really
didn’t stink that bad.” Rather than
reaching for a fresh pair of all-
white Hanes, he simply inverted

the same pair and laid them out for
the next day.

Polanski has never been happier,

“projecting monthly savings of 67
~ cents on the laundry detergent he

would otherwise be “wasting.”
