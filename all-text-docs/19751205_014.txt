The Davidson Rugby Foot-
ball Club reached the quarter-
finals of consolation play in
the Washington Sevens Rug-
by Tournament over the
Thanksgiving break.
One of the largest tourna-
ments in the country, the
' Washington Sevens. features
52 teams with seven players
on each side rather than 15 of
orthodox rugby.
Two Maryland teams
proved to be the Wildcats’
“demise as Davidson compiled
a 2-2 tournament record.
Facing the University of
Maryland in its first contest,
Davidson was downed 22-0 as
most of the Wildcats played
sevens rugby for the first
time.

But Davidson came back in
-Laura Moses the consolation bracket: to
‘defeat Madison College of
Virginia 17-6. Three big plays
insured victory for the Wild-

John Lovett pushed
through the Madison defenses
for the first score. Then David
Swaim crushed a Madison
rally with another try.

The victory was iced with a
54-yard jaunt by Mark Con-
nors and a field goal by
Swaim.

Camp Lejeune’s Marines
were the next Davidson vic-
tims. Following excellent drib-
bling by Davidson alumnus
Dave Brudzinski, Reverand
Hamilton scooped up the ball
and raced 32 yards for a score.

gain tourney quarter-finals

But Davidson’s tenuous
lead was repeatedly threat-
ened by the Marine’s offense.
It took a tenacious Davidson
defense led by Mark Arm-
strong and Carlton Cooke to
repel a Marine advance which
nearly reached the Davidson
goal.

The game ended in a 6-0
Davidson victory.

Davidson was finally elim-
inated by Mob, a team of
University of Maryland alum-
ni. Swaim slashed through for
a try, but it was not enough as
the Wildcats were beaten 19-6.

Wiley wins annual
ROTC turkey shoot

Senior Dave Wiley, an ama-
ture sharpshooter, walked
away with first place in the
annual ROTC Turkey Shoot
recently. Wiley hit for 22 out
of 25 points to win the coveted
first place. The prize for his
efforts is 2 steak dinners in
Concord.

“TIT guess I was lucky,”
Wiley said, ‘“‘Because I just
went in and shot, There was
no scope to sight with and no
practice shots were allowed.

“This is the first time I’ve
shot a gun since last year.
Heck, I just aimed and pulled
the trigger.”

Wiley added, “I used to
hunt a lot back home and I

guess that helped, but you
know, this is. the first turkey
shoot I’ve been in where the
prize wasn’t a turkey.”’

This year’s shoot was set up
a little different than in pre-
vious years by the Scabbard
and Blade. Shooters got 5
shots at 5 different targets
with 5.points for each. A
perfect score would then be 25.
Rifles used were .22’s. The
shoot was held on the 50 foot
ROTC range.

Dick Boehner and Rick Mil-
ler tied for second with scores
of 21. Carolyn Simpson out
shot the rest of the coeds to
take the women’s first. For the
faculty it was Dr. Avinger and
Zack Long capturing the
honors.
