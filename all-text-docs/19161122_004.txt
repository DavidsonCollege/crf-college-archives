WEEKLY MEETINGS.

In the Philanthropic Society Satur-
day night the question, “Resolved, “Phat
Capital Punishment Should be Abol-
ished,” was upheld on the Affirmative by
W. C. Worth, Campbell, Hamilton,
Freeman and Reese, and on the Nega-
tive by Currie, W. C. Neel, R. W. Rob-
inson, Tremain and Fowle.

The Affirmative brought out the fol-
lowing points: The abolition of capital
punishment is humane and consistent
with an advanced civilization; that there
would be no extermination of the race;
that society is protected by the imprison-
ment of the law-breaker, and the pris-
oner is given an opportunity to reform;
that it has been tried and found to be a
success; that the survival of the old cus-
tom is inexpedient, wrong and unneces-
sary. The principle being wrong in
that the State should respect life, and
that the idea is not in accord with. true
conceptions of punishment.

The Negative based their argument
on these issues: That the custom was a
Divine decree and has been found effi-
cient in former times; that the punish-
ment: is necessary because by it law is
maintained; that the percentage of mut-
ders is curtailed; that society is rid of a
dangerous element and any change would
result in the people taking the Jaw into
their own hands, and that this change
would remove the fear of death which is
so strong in the minds of the criminal
class. The law is just because it re-
cults iv a higher value being placed an
human life in general; in giving proper
retribution to the criminal, and in les-
sening the opportunities for mob viol-
ence. Finally, when strictly and rigor-
ously upheld, the law is entirely satis-
factory, as the case of England with its
low percentage of murders will show,
when compared with conditions in the
United States. The decisions of the

judges and of the house was in favor of|lege students, took a hike on last Mon-

the Negative.

The- regular order of exercises was
suspended Monday morning on account
of the election of officers. The results
were: President. R. H. Ratchford:
Vice-President, Woodrow Clark; Sec-
retary, J. T. Maddrey; First Super-
visor, C. W. Worth; Second Supervisor,
W. M. Currie; First Critic, W. H.
Neal; Second Oritic,“W. C. Cumming.

In the Eumenean Society last Satur-
day night the question was upheld on the
Affirmative by A. P. Saunders. L. M.
Thomas and J. B. Woods, and on the

The Affirmative argued that capital | gues

abolished; and, that the movement to
abolish capital punishment has spread in
Europe and in some of the States of the
United States and that statistics show
the number of crimes to have decreased.

In beginning their argument the
Negative laid the burden of the proof
on the Affirmative that the abolition of
capital punishment would make crimes
less. They then argued that the aboli-
tion of capital punishment would tend
to diminish the criminal’s regard for
committing crimes since the penalty has
been ligtened: that capital punishment
sets an example to other criminals; that
it carries out the law of “Life for
Life:” that the idea should be justice—
not brotherly love; that more murders
are committed in the United States than
in anv one ‘of five European countries.
and that only 3 per cent of these are
punished with death; that it is neces-
sary for the good of social life. “The
judges and the house decided in favor
of the Affirmative.

In the Eumenean Society Monday
morning Declamations were given by C
F, Allen, Solomons, Burns and L. C.
Brand. Andrew Brown delivered ar
oration on “Why We Should Prepar:
for War.”
