Equity

The report isn’t out yet. At Jeast
the one that everyone is awaiting,
mostly with a fearful eagerness. The
“interim” report by the Fraternity
Evaluation Committee which was pre-
sented to Student Council Monday
did little more than state that the
committee had been meeting and
vaguely what it had been doing.

However, included in the necessar-
ily sketchy report were several gen-
erally non-controversial recommend-
ations which indicate the range of
the committee’s examination of fra-
ternities and social life: Proposed are
a campus-wide social committee and
a social assessment of all students.

‘We support the idea of a campus-
wide social committee performing the
booking functions now carried on by
the Interfraternity Counci) (IFC). The
committee would be representative of

A Waste

We have avoided commenting on
chapel this year because it's an anci-
ent and tiring issue. We would rather
remain imprisoned than try to butt
down a brick wall with our heads. . ..

Our argument has always rested on
the idea of freedom rather than com-
pulsion, and, since this has been ade-
quately aired in the past, we have
tried to avoid repetition. But now we
wish to enter a plea for a bit of dis-
cretion: .

If a program falls through at the
last minute, or if a person in charge
of arrangements failed in his task,
must we follow through with the
hollow ritual?

When the speaker is James Farmer
or Ethel Nash or James Jackson Kil-

Spark

Army ROTC has never impressed
us with its imagination. In fact, Army
ROTC has never revealed to us any
concern for this dearth of creative
approach.

Then several weeks ago students
were asked to submit critiques of
the ROTC program. This self-exami-
nation was nothing startling. But our
firmly fixed picture of the staid ROTC

all the student body: fraternity men
and Independents would be represent-
ed in proportion to their numbers in
the student body.

To finance the social program, the
college would include a social assess-
ment in the general fees, thereby pro-
viding the committee with a budget
substantially larger than that of this
year’s IFC.

The proposals are equitable: each
student pays the same amount towards
campus social life and each student,
consequently, has an equal voice in the
selection of entertainment.

Implementation of this proposal by
the faculty and trustees would indi-
cate that the college is willing to be-
gin moving towards improving the
social life of each individual member
of the student body.

patrick we have little reason to com-
plain. But when an excellent program
cannot be arranged, why have a “pro-
gram” merely for the sake of having
attendance checked? Surely, no chapel
is better than a poor chapel; present-
ing a lousy program is a more unfavor-
abie reflection on those in charge
of arrangements than no program at
all.

Far too often this year the DA-
VIDSONIAN news editor has reported
at our Sunday night staff meetings
that chapel for the next week “is
still up in the air.” Pitiful programs
have followed all too often on these
indefinite dates, programs which were
planned for no reason other than to
fill a vacant period which existed.

There is need for discretion.

Department was suddenly shattered
when extensive changes resulted from
the questionnaires:

That the Department is willing to
enact changes in an attempt to pro-
vide a less time-consuming and all
the while more meaningful program
is significant. We didn’t know the
Army was willing to try anything
new. We were pleasantly surprised.

Take Blue Boy Down

Down in Secaucus, N. J., there is
a huge billboard by the side of the
highway which advertises culture.
Superimposed on it is an enormous re-
production of Thomas Gainsborough’s
“Blue Boy.”

That’s all. No “Buy Binkies,” no
“Drive a Shmoomobile,” no “Vote for
Bassoon.”

The advertising company behind the
endeavor plans to reproduce other
works of art on other billboards which
happen to be empty at the time. “Bill-
boards,” the president of the company
told a reporter, ‘are the general pub-
lic’s art gallery.”

While the idea undoubtedly comes
straight from the heart, we wonder if
it is wise. From the point of view of
safety, what would happen if they put
reproductions of Picasso’s wild “Guer-
nica” or Goya’s seductive portrait of
his mistress up there?

And from another point of view
it would seem kind of ridiculous if
they hid the real landscape with land-
scape paintings.

If we have to have billboards. let’s
keep those good old ads on them.
We think the public’s art gallery is
still in the museums.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Jones Salutes Wildcats:

'We Have All Been Proud'

Dear Editor:

The basketball season is over.
Only the hollowness of this fact
reflects its incredulous finality.
Inevitably it is a time of mean-
ing’ess questions and answers.
Does Davidson really belong
in the Southern Conference?

Yes or no... , the basketball
season is over.
The Southern Conference

Tournamem has crowned a
champion of just that. The sig-
nificance of such a ttle is at-
tested to by the fact that for
the last two years its finals
have pitted the fourth and sixth
seeded teams. Last year's
champion was run off the floor
by the Ivy League. The system

* Is not worthy of further mock-

ery. The records attest to what
justice and common sense are
and are not.

But maybe we have all felt
something a Little deeper than
frustation. Much of last year's
student body emotion was sel-
fish. This year much more is
sympathetic. If we wanted
vindication in victory. what of
those who played the game?

Especially now we should not
over dramatize and we must
not defend what doesn't need
defending. But we can and
should say thank you to a hand-
ful of athletes who have add-
ed so much to all that is David-
son College. And to Lefty
Driesell for as great a dedi-
cation to purpose as exists in
the Davidson community or
anywhere in the coaching
ranks. And more impressive in
defeat than victory. Fred
Hetzel is (aggresion not witn-
standing) an authentic All
American.

The 1964-65 Davidson College
basketball team was by far

the best in the Southern Con-
ference and one of the best

in tne nation. This team had.

heart and guts. They wanted
the tournament—perhaps too

badly to have won it, but they
could have played with any-
body. anywhere,any time. There
were personalities too and they
will be missed.

Following last year's loss to
Furman, Rick Lowery said ‘I
will be in Durham on Saturday
night, and I will be porud to
be there.” For three years we
have all been proud.

They will be remembered
for the way they played the
game.

Professor Kelton, in his ‘Feb.
19 article in THE DAVIDSON-
IAN, listed six ways in which
the Speaker Ban Law would
tear down democratic principles
and aid communism. On the con-
trary. a modified law, along the
line of Michigan’s law. would
support Democratic principles
and deter communism in the
areas he listed.

(1) The purpose of the law
is not to keep students from
coming into contact with
communist doctrine; this is
impossible. It is, instead.
to refuse to communist
speakers a tax-supported po-
sition from which they may
expound on the mythical
advantages of the collectiv-
ist, communist form of dic-
tatorship.

(2) If there was a demand
for an informative lecture

FILM FRIENDS PRESENT

‘Canned Theater’ Junked

By WALTER MEEKS
Asst. Professor of French
The next presentation of the Film Friends “Great
Directors Series” will be Rene Clair’s A Nous la Liberte,
March 9 and 10 at 8 p. m. in Hodson Hall.

A film viewer of today, rath-
er far removed from the ex-
perimentation of Dada and Sur-
realism. may well wonder upon
seeing Clair's masterpiece what
is great about it. Three-and-a-
a half decades of talkies pro-
duced since A Nous le Liberte
will likely have dulled his aural
sensitivity.

The coming of sound in motion
pictures found most film mak-
ers unsure what to do with it.
Their usual reflex was to adapt
it to films m a realistic man-
Ner, speech becoming an in-
tegral part of plot develop
ment. Rene Clair refused can-
ned theatre, and more daring
than most directors dared to
be, he broke from conventional
practices and used sound not
vas it is in THE world but as
tt is in HIS wor'd.

Clair goes so far as to kid
the whole concept of synch-
ronous sound in A Nous ta
Liberte. In one episode a yonug
man admires from afar the
heroine, who is singing in her
window. Suddenly, the voice
goes awry, whines, whirs, fades
away. When the girl appears a
moment later on the street, the

audience learns that it has
been listening to a phonograph
in another apartment. that the
appearance of reality is not
reality.

For Clair, who insisted upon
the visual element. many of
the techniques of the silent
film, especially those of Chap-
lin, were still valid. His pic-
tures flash along like ballets,
whole sequences being joined
together by music. Sound, above
all asynchronous sound, may
add ‘to perception and to en-
richment of mood and atmos-
phere, but its use is always to
enhance the visual.

This film itself is not Dadaist
or Surrealist, but the inflaence
of these movements on Clair
allowed him a considerable
freedom to experiment in the
new medium of talking pictur-
es. Moreover, in dealing with
the comic instead of the ser-
dous, he was not hampered by
demands for realism.

A Nous la Liberte is good fun
and an aesthetic experience,
but one must remain alert
while watching it to catch what
Clair is up to with sight and
sound.

series on communism, it
could be conducted by some-
one (John Noble, for ex-
ample) who would not at-
tempt to hide its terrible im-
plications and who had
actually experienced life un-
der the system. Such a lec-
ture series would be excel-
lent preparation for our
young people.

(3) Communism is always
wide-open to refutation whe-
ther there is a speaker or
not. Also, is communism
“typically” refuted by col-
lege students? I think not,
as is evidenced by the daily
student-led anti - American,
pro-communist demonstra-
tions both here and abroad.

(4) Professor Kelton said
that communism's appeal
would be enhanced because
under the law it would be
“forbidden”, This would not
be the case. Besides the fact
that communists could al-
ways speak off-campus, uni-
versity libraries contain both
pro-and anti-communist lit-
erature. The student is free
to choose.

(5) The law does not indi-
cate that the democratic
process cannot cope with
communism; it merely with-
draws the support of the
North Carolina taxpayer
from the communist move-
ment.

(6) Most importantly, the
law does not abridge free-
dom of thought or speech.
Communists are completely
free to speak anywhere they
choose, their only restriction
is that they may not use
state-supported facilities.

A modified Speaker Ban
Law would be a just and
necessary law. It would
prohibit the use of state
funds for the support of a
doctrine which aims at
either the death or enslave-
ment of all of us and the
abolishment of all the free-
doms we are trying to pro-
tect. A law could hardly be
more sensible.

Once More

With Feeling

By TIM KIMREY
Davidsonian Associate Editor ;

Within a few weeks the Fraternity Evaluation
Committee will make public the results of its long
and arduous discussion concerning the future of
national fraternities on the campus of this college.
Doubtless the report will be met with groans and
shouts of praise alike. One thing is certain: there
will be some changes made. The only question is
how sweeping these changes will be.

And, in a very real sense, neither the Fraternity
Evaluation Committee nor the student body at
large can pretend to say how far the changes should
go. The pros and cons fill the air, but nothing con-
structive can come of the whole bitter dialogue un-
til the College (meaning the faculty, administration,
and Board of Trustees) makes up its collective
mind about the general direction that Davidson Col-
lege will take in the next, say, fifty years.

As we see it—and, at that, very generally—
there are two possible directions in which this in-
stitution may move, two possible goals that the Col-
lege may embrace. We might analogously denote
these two directions as “The Sewanee Direction”
and “The Williams Direction.” ;

Again reminding ourselves of the generalities
involved, what could we presume to see should we
view Davidson College 20 years from now after it
took off on one of the other of the above-mentioned
“Directions?”

Should Davidson embark in the “Sewanee Direc-
tion,” we imagine that she would remain pretty
much the same kind of institution that she is today,
with the natural progressions that 20 years would
almost automatically bring.

The library would probably have at least 50
per cent more volumes. There would be a new dormi-
tory. National fraternities would still go through
their rites of bidding and pledgeship. The majority
of the Board of Trustees would be representatives
of the Presbyterian Church, and there would still
be an emphasis on Protestant Christianity, through
perhaps in some different form than it is today.

The composition of the student body would, in
all likelihood, be much the same as it is now. There
would still be many boys who Mommy and Daddy
sent off to a good “safe” school to get that all-
important (both for social and economic reasons)

egree.

Davidson would still be the place to go if you
wanted a fairly good education plus good parties,
social graces, protection from the depersonalization
of a big university. This is the place for the idealist,
the person who has already envisioned what he will
be when he leaves Davidson.

And what if Davidson takes the hypothetical
“Williams Direction?” We can imagine a campus
free from the encumberments of a selective fra-
ternity system, a campus where every man is ac-
cepted as a social equal, at least officially. Of
course, there would be something to take the place
of fraternities—some kind of non-selective eating
clubs.

In all likelihood, all compulsory religious exer-
cises would be abolished. There would probably be
no rules against the drinking of alcoholic bever-
ages on the campus, the assumption being that ma-
ture men know that they cannot get an education
with a highball in their hands every minute. Social
life in general would reflect a great deal more ma-
turity, and would be a lot more fun.

Educationally, the College would be far superior
to what it is today. If the “Oath” were removed,
the College would offer a much bigger attraction
to outstanding scholars and teachers. Obviously, it
would be much more difficult academically, but
with the greater social freedom and mobility would
come an increased appreciation of things intellectual.
The atmosphere would be more sophisticated and
cosmopolitan; we might even have more than the
present handful of Negroes, and perhaps a commun-
ist and an atheist on the faculty.

And, most importantly, Davidson College would
no longer be a “safe” place to send one’s son. It
could well be that four years could change several
freshmen into completely worthless radicals, even
beatniks. But, by the same token, four years at such
a Davidson could produce many more outstanding
contributors in the scholary fields of history, soci-
ology, English, political science etc.; more men who
are qualified to make their marks in the arts;
music, painting, literature, etc.; and, yes, more
men who would be more effectual members of the
Christian clergy and/or laity.

And, thus it is that, in a very real sense, no
decision should be made at this point regarding
the future of fraternities on the Davidson campus.
The direction of the College must first be ascertain-
ed. For if the “Sewanee Direction” is chosen, then
there is a place for competitive, selective national
fraternities. But, on the other hand, if the College
should chose to move in the “Williams Direction,”
then exclusive fraternities have no place whatsoever
on this campus.

Where are we going, Gentlemen?

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Fite Predicts A ‘Zitty City’

Dear Editor:

Princeton of the South? What
a misnomer! It's a lot nearer
Bob Jones University of the
North (not to be confused with
our ‘own Bob Jones). A Christ-
ian institution such as David-
son ought tO stop trying to fool
people and should be honest
about its true nature—if the
schoot continues in its present
dfrection, the academic stand-
ards of Davidson will be the only
facet favorable to Princeton.

A.new name should be adopted
—Zitty City, the Advanced
Academic Prep School. The
characteristics of thfs wonder
ful school could be plentiously
extolled such as enforced study,

‘no drinking, no social activities

above the junior high level, en-
forced pseudo-religion, and most
important—absolute protection
from any exposure to society as
a reality.

The fraternity evaluation.com-
mittee can really be considered
fair—yeah, with a couple of

neutrals and the ramrodding of
radical opponents of the fraterni-
ties. Anybody knows that uni-
versal misery is far better than
limitations of a few. If every-
one can't be socially equal in
the farcical utopian of Davidson
activities, then no one should
be allowed to enjoy himself.

There are several other in-
equalities at Davidson that need
to be investigated and corrected.
Why not do away with anyone
having cars. Those on academic
scholarships can't have them,
and some people don't have
enough money—so no one should
be allowed to have a car at
school,

Why have cars or fraternities
anyway—as proposed, the school
could plan social events: Can't

you just see the Davidson stu-
dent body on buses headed en
masse for a mixer at Randolph-
Macon! Maybe the student

council would pass a regulation
allowing students to carry flasks
in their back pockets—if they
keep them buttoned.

What kind of student will want
to come to the desolate human-
ity-starved Davidson that ap-
pears to be not far off. The
last means of escape from
academia are in danger of being
taken’ away with no real al-
ternatives, Such an. atmosphere
will breed only a bunch of zits
(strange. study-mongers) and
will certainly discourage the
well-rounded young men that the
Davidson admission office huffs
and puffs (and bluffs) so much
about.
