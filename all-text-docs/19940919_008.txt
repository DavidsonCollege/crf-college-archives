A Different ° °

Perspective: Meer EHow important is the Confederate flag?
Ike Bailey —y

Tie Confederate Flag seems to
be a major source of contempt for
the majority of people in the Afri-
can-American community. At the
same time, it seems to represent a
source of pride for a majority of
Southern white-Americans. I can-
not speak intelligently on the latter
view, but I have a few views on the
former.

First of all, I am constantly
told by supporters of the flag that
slavery was not the central issue of
the Civil War. Granted, there were
many reasons for the war. It can be
reasoned that the war was an eco-
nomic one, that it was fought for
freedom of choice, that it was
fought because of pride. It can
even be reasoned that slavery was
brought up as an issue in this war
simply as a military tactic, as the

North’s way of trying to under-
mine the morale of the confederate
soldiers, making them look like
“bad guys” for defending such an
institution.

I, and the majority of the Afri-
can-American race, have yet to be
convinced that slavery was not the
central issue. After all,

that flag. It is supposed to repre-
sent great Southern heritage.

The only heritage this symbol
reminds an entire race of people of
is the worst stage in their history
that they had to endure. It reminds
us of the pure hate that has been

shown towards us since we arrived:

"obsolete farm machinery.”

How can any African-Ameri-
can be expected to want or respect
a symbol that represents the killing
of over 100 million of his brothers
and sisters? Should we just accept
it now simply because we are over
a hundred years removed from sla-
very? What if the

would there have been
sucha war if slavery had
not existed? With this

What if the Confederacy had
won? Would I be here now?

Confederacy had
won? Would I be
herenow, trying to
further my educa-

being realized, how can
anyone _not understand the con-
tempt that an African-American
would have towards a symbol of
such an institution.

Ithas been referred to as South-
ern Pride. Well, I am sure that
there are millions of southern Afri-
can-Americans who are not filled
with pride when in the presence of

in this country, and most of us
arrived against our will.

It reminds us of the fact that
our ancestors were chained and
whipped as if they were animals. It
reminds us of the belief that J.D.
Adler, the grand dragon of the
KKK, andhis many followers hold,
that we are now nothing more than

tion, or would I be out in Mr.
Charlie’s field with the shackles
on my feet, afraid of being whipped
again? Or would my parent’s gen-
eration, or their parent’s genera-
tion been the last one to endure
such hell?

In my mind, the Confederate
flag can breed nothing more than

hate, contempt, and fear. Why is it
considered with such pride in the
eyes of so many people? Does it
have anything to do with the fact
that that institution killed offa few
thousand or more Negroes before
it was all said and done?

I did not write this article to
get rid of the bumper stickers, the
t-shirts, and the flags hanging out
of windows. I don’t believe we
should ever get to the point that we
are not allowed to speak our minds
or exercise freedom of choice.

But I also recognize the fact
that the flying of that flag over my
home state of South Carolinashows
an utter lack of respect for an entire
community. Besides a lack of re-
spect, I believe it says much more
about that state, and this country as
a whole.

-Open your mind and go country.

This past weekend I did some-
thing I thought I’d never do in my
entire life. I mean, we’re talking
one of those hell-freeze-over kind
of things. A few months ago, such
anaction would have certainly mer-
ited wearing a paper bag over my

_ sorry head for the remainder of the

semester. Yes, I confess. I at-
tended a Travis Tritt concert. God
have mercy or suk. me down
where I stand.

For the uninitiated, Travis
Tritt is one of the biggest stars of
country music. Now, I know what
you’re saying: that nasal twang,
those sappy lyrics, and, of course,
the horrible steel guitar. That’s
exactly what I was saying not too

long ago. In fact, there was almost

nothing I hated more than listening
to country music. Until one week-
end roadtrip.

My friend and I were heading
to Pittsburgh, abouta six hour drive
from home. He was driving and, of
course, the only thing he listened
to was country ... the entire trip.
You can imagine my vehement

protestations, Let’s change the
channel. Let’s take turns picking
the music. How about some peace
and quiet? No go. He wasn’t
budging. So, I suffered every darn
mile of road we covered.

But then a funny thing hap-
pened. Onthe way home, I noticed
myself singing the words to an
unknown tune. Lord help me! It
was a country song. What was
happening to me? Was I being
brainwashed by the legions of

country fans across the nation? ~

Yes, indeed. And by the time I
realized what was happening, it
was too late. I had lost all free will.
I was a country junkie.

Ofcourse, itdoesn’t stop there.
Country music has a way of grow-

ing on you. First you can sing.

along to a few songs. Then you
buy a CD or two. The next thing
you know, all the stations in your
car are preset to the Rebel, KIX 96,
and Young Country.

Finally, you find yourself at
Blockbuster Pavilion for a Travis
Tritt concert. Someone once said

the road to hell is a slippery one.
How true!

Anyway, my point in all this:
Don’t close your mind to things
you don’t know about or haven’t
tried. Look at me. Once a hated
foe; now a tried and true hick,
redneck, or whatever. Something
you may not have ever heard about
could become the passion of your
life. There are so many undiscov-
ered gems out there awaiting each
one of us. And wouldn’t it really
be a tragedy if we passed by some-
thing wonderful because we were
never willing to give it a second
chance.

So, my advice i is to keep your
eyes, your ears, and most impor-
tantly, your mind open. Talk to
somebody new. Try something
you’d never think of doing. Don’t
change the channel when you hear
a country song. Now, I’m not
trying to brainwash you into an-
other country fan or anything like
that. But it would be nice to have
someone to go to the next Travis
Tritt concert with!

I want to be a millionaire.

Hi; letter came the other day.
The last few words stood out to
me—“I am so proud of you;” I sat
for amoment, surprised. And then
remembering the many years of
childhood we spent together, I felt
a wave of guilt come over me.

It was in sixth grade that the
real sadness started in his life. He
called acouple of days after Christ-
mas to say his dad had been mur-
dered, a drug deal gone bad. A few
years later, the call came when his
mom was: getting abused by his
step-father. He whispered to me,
hoping they’d forget he was home.

In high school, the phone calls
stopped. Instead, I would open the
doorat some late hour and he would
be standing there with a grim look
on his face, waiting for some sort
of love. Those days, he spent a lot

of nights on our couch and ate a lot
of dinners with us for holidays.
We’d wash dishes afterwards and
he’d always look at me and say
earnestly, “Isn’t dad great” or
“Doesn’t mom’s new haircut look
nice?” I’dsmile, the horrible phone
call from sixth grade replaying
faintly in the back of my mind.

Our junior year was worse for
him. His mom divorced and began
her search for self. He’d come
over at night and frown, blaming
himself for his mother’s unhappi-
ness. .

“She’s been raising me since
she was fifteen. Of course she
hasn’t had a chance to find her-
self.”

I could only sit and shake my
head no; words would have be-
trayed the incredible feeling of sad-

ness I had inside of me.
Our senior year looked up for

him. Applications off to Harvard,

Yale, and Williams; calls were
coming in from every admissions
office possible as they desperately
tried to win this bright student and
state champion wrestler. Itseemed
he would be able to run away from
all the sadness of his childhood
and adolescence.

This time when he showed up
at our door the look on his face
seemed etched incold gray marble.

‘I pulled him inside and listened as

he mumbled over and over again
about his mom joining the army
and leaving within the month. ~
“She’s renting me an apart-
ment until I leave for school in
August. She needed to do some-
thing for herself. She won’t be at

my graduation. She just needs to
move on.”

He was' doing everything he
could to forgive her, to excuse her,
to justify why he would suddenly
be all alone. I sat, in silence, un-
sure of what I could do except offer
my family to him for the final
months before he left for college.

She left; off to basic training
and then Japan. He avoided the
apartment as much as possible and
slowly moved himself into our
house.

In August, I took off for
Davidson with two carloads of
unnecessary trinkets and he headed
for Williams with a suitcase, acom-
forter, $150 in cash, a few things
my mom pushed on him that he
didn’t want to take, and the address
of a ship somewhere on the other

side of the world.

This summer, we talked for an
extended period. Practically
brother and sister, we had always
shared so much pride ineach other.
I had begun to wonder, however,
whathis real big picture was, where
he was headed with all of his
dreams.

"I want to be a millionaire.”

My stomach turned at that idea
and I challenged him.

His response was in the letter:
"When you’re six years old and
you’re laying in bed wondering if
the electricity will be cut back on

_ inthe morning or if you’ re going to

eat or if your shoes are going to fall
apart in gym because they’ re look-
ing pretty bad; then you decide
