_The challenge of on-line government

Much has been written about
the benefits and services available
over the Internet. Most students at
Davidson enjoy the free privilege
of communicating with others on
the Internet and using Internet ser-
vices. Scientists and academics
have long used the Internet to ex-
change information. Baby
Boomers are fascinated with this
new technology and seem eager to
exploit its power, mostly for per-
sonal or entertainment uses.

The Internet is more than a
~ way to keep in touch; it has politi-
cal implications as well. How-
ever, few have thought about the
effects the Internet could have on
the American political system.
Most members of Congress have
Internet addresses where constitu-
ents and interest groups can voice
their opinions more easily than ever

before. The power of instant, face-

less communication to influence
decision-making is staggering. In
a pluralistic system where access
to vast amounts of information is
critical, the Internet is second only

to the computer in the new tech-
nologies influencing government.
As more homes and institutions
are connected, the Internet will
change American communities
much the way the telephone, auto-
mobile, and computer have in the
past. The Internet will not destroy
American civilization, as some
have predicted about past inven-
tions, but it will bring greatchanges.

The obvious result of increas-
ing on-line access to government
is the ease with which anyone can
contact an official. It costs almost
nothing to send an e-mail message
to a representative or senator. Be-
fore the Internet, people had to be
motivated and willing to pay, in
both time and money, to contact
their representatives.

Now typing a message is
costless and requires little time.
Those who have a small stake in an
issue now have more incentive to
make their views known. Interest
groups will flourish with this effi-
cient, free access, much as web
sites have multiplied on the

Internet. Using the Internet in this
way will overwhelm representa-
tives with a great diversity of opin-
ion; they will feel compelled to
respond to more and more inter-
ests and lose sight of overall goals.

E-mail will have a significant
effect on legislative responsive-
ness. Monitoring on-line commu-
nications will lead to a type of
direct democracy that the Founders
did not intend. Increased access
means that representatives will
become more aware of what con-
stituents want, especially the “si-
lent majority” who are becoming
more vocal using e-mail.
Internet forums, the will of the
people can be known and mea-
sured instantly. Legislators, given
the irresistible temptation and im-
mediacy of e-mail, will be pressed
to react to whatever people send
over the Internet instead of dispas-
sionately analyzing policy. Rep-
resentatives may no longer be a
cautious buffer against swings in
public opinion. _

This awareness will expand

With

what representatives are expected
todo. With constituents more will-
ing tocontact their representatives,
more demands will be placed on
staffers’ time to respond to re-
quests. The scope of government
may be broadened unconsciously
without any force to counterbal-
ance all the demands for action on
e-mail. Local concerns may over-
ride national priorities.

The tone of policy debate will
change with increasing use of e-
mail. Writing in the Los Angeles
Times, Janny Scott argues that
people “feel freer when talking
electronically” because of the im-
personal nature of the medium.
She contends that “the language
people use on a computer is spon-
taneous and uninhibited.” This
may lead to more candor. But it
may also descend into a rude dia-
logue of sound bites peppered with
coarse jokes. Policy decisions are
complex; the short messages en-
couraged by the medium of the
Internet may discourage intelligent
dialogue. Also, e-mail does not

allow for conversation or argu+
ment, and it minimizes interaction.
There cannot be honest, respon-
sive debate unless the users are
connected in real-time. Use of e-
mail to relay political messages
may oversimplify issues and lead
to hasty, ill-considered decisions.

E-mail, because of its imme-
diacy, shortcomings as a medium,
and tendency to expose raw emo-
tion, should not be the dominant
means of influencing government
and gauging sentiment.

This is not to suggest that
Internet use will stop or that it
should stop. Expansion of the.
Internet into political forums is
inevitable, but its full effects will
not be felt until most of the Ameri-
can people have access to it.

These effects on priorities and
debate should be carefully weighed
before relying heavily on “public
policy by e-mail.” According to
Michael Scrage of The Washing-

- ton Post, ‘The future of the Internet

will reveal an awful lot about the
future of America.”

The Endangered Species Act:
No grounds for guns! ©

When I decided to go, south
for college it was mostly for warmer
weather anda friendly atmosphere.
I have since, however, come to
appreciate another perk particular
to North Carolina. The coastal plain
of North Carolina, east of the North
Carolina piedmont, hosts several
species of plants and animals spe-
cific to North Carolina and its
longleaf pine forests. As a biology
major, I have grown to appreciate
this area for its uniqueness as well
as its beauty. In addition to its
beautiful scenery, the coastal plain
provides ahome for many of North
Carolina’s 42 endangered species.
The destruction of habitat neces-
sary for the survival of these spe-
cies is the main reason for their low
population. As a result, many of
the remaining healthy populations
of endangered species in North
Carolina are located on the mili-
tary bases that dot the Coastal Plain.
Military bases have been protected
from logging and development,
both of which are leading causes of
habitat destruction. Thus the mili-
tary possession and protection of
this property has also led to the
protection of many endangered
species that rely on mature forests.
Unfortunately, however, the coex-
istence of endangered species and
the military has not been harmoni-
ous.

The red-cockaded wood-
pecker, endemic to North Caro-
lina, is an example of this conflict.
Habitat requirements for this spe-
cies of woodpecker consist of ma-

ture longleaf pines in which birds .

excavate a cavity nest. This spe-
cies is in danger of extinction be-
cause many longleaf pines have
been exposed to logging. As a re-
sult, many existent longleaf pines
are too young and narrow to house
the red-cockaded woodpecker. In

addition, the heartwood of younger

trees is dense and difficult to exca- |

vate! However, €xcavation is much
easier in older trees because the
heartwood has been softened by
decay. Another habitat consider-
ation involves the social system of
the red-cockaded woodpecker.
This species lives in groups con-
taining one breeding pair. Although
each member of the group main-
tains a separate roost cavity, it must
be located close in proximity to
allow members to assist in incuba-
tion and feeding of the fledglings.
To ensure a healthy reproductive
rate, pine forests must have clus-
ters of longleaf pines that can ac-
commodate group members.
Although military bases seem
to be an ideal location for these
restricted populations, they present
additional danger to already en-
dangered populations of the red-
cockaded woodpecker. Tanks and
firing ranges also populate the ar-
eas in which this endangered spe-
cies seeks refuge. At Fort Bragg
lines of red tape mark where mili-
tary traffic is forbidden because it
lies within 60 meters of a nesting
cavity belonging to ared-cockaded
woodpecker. In 1991 the US Fish
and Wildlife Service shut down
the base’s $20 million firing line in
order to protect a population of
red-cockaded woodpeckers.
These protective actions are
the mandate of the Endangered
Species Act of 1973. This legisla-
tion maintains the authority to pe-
nalize anyone who disturbs or
threatens a listed species. So why
are endangered species at risk on
government properties? In re-
sponse to many actions taken by
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
to investigate activities at Fort
Bragg, many military officials are
raising questions about the priori-

ties of the United States govern-
ment. They maintain that conduct-
ing a‘ training régime on areas
chopped up by red taped zones is
impossible.

Military specialists grumble
that the base should look like a
battlefield and that current stan-
dards of the Endangered Species
Act go against military doctrine.
Rather, they would like to see the
remaining longleaf pine forests in
North Carolina turn into war zones
so that young troops can have the
true battlefield experience. As a
voice for these endangered wood-
peckers and all those endangered
species that seek .refuge in the
Coastal Plain, I say NO.

Although many people, mili-
tary included, do not understand
the importance, nor the cost, of this
rare species of woodpecker, its
value is multi-faceted. These aes-
thetically pleasing birds contrib-
uted to the richness of the North
Carolina coastal plain. Also, the
moral view that all species have a
right existence is a popular plea.
More lucrative explanations, how-
ever, reflect amore utilitarian view-
point. This justification relies on
the possibility that endangered spe-
cies may hold a yet undetected
cure for cancer. For whatever rea-
son—beauty, morality, or medi-
cine—the Endangered Species Act
is a breath of fresh air and a reflec-
tion of proper prioritization.

In support of the red-cockaded
woodpecker, and many other en-
dangered species in North Caro-
lina and throughout the United
States, I urge you to support the
reauthorization of the Endangered
Species Act and alert your sena-
tors about yourconcerns regarding
the safety of endangered species in

your home state.

never be atrustee. lamaJew. lam .

not the only Jew at Davidson.
Muslims go to school here as well.
Students of many faiths go to
Davidson, and like so many
Davidson graduates before them,
make great contributions to the
college and society.

Moreover, the Statement of
Purpose includes several phrases
that contradict the Christian trustee
policy. First is the edict of open-
ness: “The loyalty of the College
thus extends beyond the Christian
community to the whole human
community and necessarily in-
cludes an openness to and respect
for the world’s various religious
traditions.” Evidently, the College
does not earnestly apply this state-
mentsince it does not pertain to the
Board of Trustees. In addition, the
Statement asserts, “Davidson val-
ues its diversity and seeks to be a
community that recognizes the dig-
nity and inherent worth of every
person.” But non-Christians, re-
gardless of their merits and contri-
butions to the college, are worthy
enough only to have their dignity
stripped by a policy that denies
them the opportunity to make the
penultimate donation to the col-
lege, to be a trustee.

Is not trust an important mani-

festation of dignity and commu-
nity? Is trust not what the Honor
Code is about? Davidson prom-
ises a community of dignity and
openness to its students, faculty,
and staff in the Statement of Pur-
pose. Yet, the college does not
trust the non-Christian members
of its community, or of the outside
world, to be competent for the title
of trustee. Tragically, Davidson
College contradicts its own State-
ment of Purpose by not allowing
non-Christians to be trustees.

The real travesty remains, re-
gardless of the college’s conflict-
ing statements. By not allowing
non-Christians on the Board of
Trustees, the college implies that
the contributions of other religions,
while socially: important, are re-
ally not beneficial for Davidson. I
do not want to sound as. if I hate
Davidson. Quite the opposite is
true. Davidson has meant more to
me than I could ever give back,
which is why it pains me so that I
and many other non-Christians,
with possibly more to contribute
thaneven some of the present trust-
ees, can never be trustees. Until
Davidson College recognizes the
trustworthiness of non-Christians
as an asset for the future of the
college, I refuse to contribute for
my senior class gift. I encourage
all graduates of Davidson College
to make their contributions with
the condition that this prejudicial
policy be reversed.

Sincerely,

Dan Nechemias, ’95
