It Is Time To Act

Almost two years ago Davidson's
trustees laid down their segregation-
ist admissions policy in one terse sen-
tence: “It is not in the best interest
of Davidson College to admit Negroes
at this time.”

The trustees come to Davidson for
a meeting Wednesday. We call their
attention again to this racial ban, for
it is a moral burden which will not
be made lighter by silence or neglect.

The trustee policy contradicts the
resolutions of the General Assembly
of the Presbyterian Church in the
South.

It would be illegal according to con-

stitutional authority if Davidson were
a public institution.

It is a dehumanizing policy which
sets up color. not capability, as the

standard for admission to Davidson,

It is a policy which flouts both logic
and the Christian ideals to which Dav-
idson is committed.

The trustee policy has been dis-
credited not only by conscience; it has
been discredited by time: since the
trustees’ decision to bar qualified
Negro applicants at Davidson, we
have seen the rapid breakdown of Jim
Crow barriers in Southern education.

State institutions have been the
first to open their doors: North Caro-
lina’s public institutions. universities
in the border states. and now in Geor-
gia.

Private secular ‘institutions are be-
ginning to follow: Last week the trus-

tees of the University of Miami stated
that henceforth “all qualified appli-

cants will be admitted to the Univer-
sity without regard to race or color.”

The church colleges of the South—
Davidson conspicuous among them—
are lagging. They are protected by
their standing as “private’’ institu-
tions before the law, and they are re-

sisting those who remind them of re-
sponsibility to a higher Law,

The Church, which should be lead-
ing, has been left behind.

Davidson’s trustees meet Wednes-
day in the face of a resolution passed
last week by the North Carolina Coun-
cil of Churches urging church col-
leges to consider “prayerfully and
without delay” opening their doors to
persons of all races.

“The moral leadership of the
Church in the world,” said the Coun-
cil, “is seriously imperiled by discrim-
ination.”

That fact should be plain enough in
a world which is seeing the revolu-
tionary risé of black men demanding
justice: men who watch America and
judge her by-her evil as well as by
her good. We can ill afford to contri-
bute to that evit — and we fool our-
selves to imagine that what we do here
has no impact in the wortd.

It is time to act.

THE DAVIDSONIAN urges the for-
mation of a student-faculty-trustee
committee to keep alive this issue
which few want to face. to formulate
recommendations to the Trustees iin
keeping with the best ideals of liberal
education and the Church.

It must be the responsibility of. the
Chureh and of educated men to fight
injustice, not to cling to it; to work
against prejudice, not to perpetuate
it; to encourage opportunity, not to
forestall it..

We should not wait for the pressure
of law or the pressure of opinion to
make us do right; we should do right
in response to the pressure of con-
science.

If we do not have the courage to
accomplish this, the value of our edu-
cation is cast in doubt and our Chris-
tianity exposed as a mockery.

Judicial Board : Harmful Legislation

Monday, February 20, the Student
Council will present its newly revised
Student Body Constitution in chapel.
The new constitution will include a

Judicial Board composed of five mem-.

bers of the Student Council including
the president, the two vice-presidents,
and the secretary-treasurer.

The Judicial Board will replace the
Honor Court in trying all violations
of Article X of the present constitu-
tion, This article includes student
body regulations on conduct unbe-
coming a Davidson gentleman, pos-
session of alcoholic liquors on campus.
hazing, gambling, etc.

The council has stated that the pur-
pose of establishing the Judicial
Board is to separate the handling of
offenses of honor—of which they say
there are no intermediate degrees be-
tween innocence and guilt—from the
handling of violations of student body
regulations which do involve degrees
and require discretionary judgments.

According to one council member,
another purpose of the Judicial Board
is to unify the definition and enforce-
ment of the student body regulations
in the hands of one group.

THE DAVIDSONIAN is opposed to
the adoption of the Judicial Board.

At present the Honor Court is not
overworked enforcing the honor sys-
tem and the student body regulations.
Since September the Honor Court has
conducted only three trials.

The adoption of the Judicial Board
will only transfer jurisdiction from
one organ of government to another.

Under the new constitution, a stu-
dent who pledges one hour in the

language laboratory, but stays only
55 minutes, would be tried by the
Honor Court for a violation of the
honor system. Since there can be no
discretionary judgment by the Honor
Couft, he must either be dismissed
from college, or declared innocent. We
feel that this would be narrow and
illogical. -

We see no reason why the Honor
Court should not have the power, like
any civil court, to interpret the law
which it is enforcing. Why should
only the Student Council have the
power of interpretation?

Under the new constitution it may
often be necessary to shuttle cases
from one court to another. If a stu-
dent lied under oath to the Judicial
Board, he would then have to be tried
by the Honor Court for an honor vio-
lation. Instead of unifying the judici-
ary branch of student government, it
would confuse it.

In some cases there would be much
delay and confusion because neither
court could be certain who had juris-
diction.

We recognize that many violations
of Article X are not being punished,
such as the possession of alcoholic
‘liquors on campus and unneccessary
noise in the dormitories,

But it is not necessary to form a
new court to enforce these regula-
tions; a more active role by the Honor
Court and more student support can
solve this problem.

We consider this a harmful piece
of legisilation. We urge the student
body to vote against it.

CONTACT WITH REAL GREATNESS

Reporters Are Awed, Fascinated
Interview With Jimmie Byrnes

By JOE MARTIN
and JOHN HARRIS

The sign on ‘the Secur-
ity Federal Building
flashes alternately “33°”
and “10:23.” You hurry
toward it through the
melting snow, thinking
that an early arrival for
your 10:30 appointment
will give you a few min-
utes to sit down and col-
lect. your thoughts.

You take the elevator to
the fifth floor and knock on
the door marked 501. Miss
Cassie Connor answers the
door—you've read about her
—and, without even giving
you a chance to take off your
overcoat, ushers you into the
office of the Honorable
James F. Byrnes.

PUBLIC SERVANT

To you. he’s “Governor

Byrnes;” to other people—

older people—he’s known ,

by the titles of a half-cen-
.tury spent in oublic. service:
U. S. Congressman, 1911-25:
U: S. Senator, 1931-41; U. S.
Supreme Court Justice, 1941-
42, “Asst. President’ with

final authority over domestic
affairs, 1943.45; U. S. Secre-
tary of State, 1945-46, Gover-
nor of South Carolina, 1951-
55.

You're a little ill at ease
in his presence, and you ask
about his recent. trip to New
York.

As he talks about hunting
in S. C. and Alabama, and
about mutual friends (“You
know the Boykins down

there? Great hunters, all of
them”), you begin to under-
stand why he is known sim-
ply as “Jimmie” to thous-
ands of people — millwork-
ers in your home town, Pres-
idents of the U. S. from Taft
to Truman, colored barbers
and Prime Ministers. You
realize that you are talking
to a man who really walked
with kings, yet never lost. the
common touch.

RELAXED, PERSONABLE

In spite of his relaxed,
personable manner, though.
you know, that this is the
man whom Harry S. Truman
was to have nominated for
the second spot on the Demo-
cratic ticket of 1944. a posi-

tion from which he would
have ascended to the presi-
dency of the nation in 1945,
and you're still awed.

You had thought of a hun-
dred questions to ask him—
about Stalin and Churchill,
about FDR, about his failure

te.gsupport a Democratic can- *
dial for President since

1944, about Wilson and the
League of Nations—but when
he suddenly offers you the
opportunity to ask questions,
your mind goes blank.

THE LEAGUE FIGHT

You remember Wilson, and
you ask for an impression of
the fight between the Presi-
dent and Cabot Lodge over
the League. He leans back
in his red-leather chair and
begins a rambling recitation
of the events surrounding
that conflict. He gives you
character sketches of - the
men with whom he worked
— Cabot Lodge, Woodrow
Wilson. Jack Garner, Champ
Clark.

When he closes his eyes
to recall a speech by Sen.
Reed of Missouri:in the Con:

gress in 1921, you have a

“WE CHOOSE LOVE”

Shue Looks For Leadership,
Expression of Christian Ideal

By HENRY SHUE

Our generation has been called, among other names, the “generation with-
out a cause”—the generation Which follows no heroes and commits itself to no
ideals. Like all other generalizations this one is an oversimplification, but it is
largely true of white American young people.

If we white youths have
no causes for which we yearn
to live, the Trustees of Dav-
idson College should be con-
cerned to give leadership to
the 900 for whom they have

accepted much _responsibil-
ity. The Trustees should
know that we have not al-
ways been disillusioned about
principles and unconcerned
about responsibility to oth-
ers.

When we entered David-

son, most of us were vigor-
ous idealists who believed
that some values are worth
sacrificing oneself for. We
even believed that state-
ments like “God is love”
were more than poetry and
that images like the Oneness
of the Body of Christ—the
Church — were supposed to
be put into practice. We
were really children then!

We are wiser now-—we
now that love is en ideal
to be praised by professors
in the classroom but net
to be practiced in the effi-
clet policies of the college.

We are glad that we are
no longer naive, but we do
wish that we had some pur-
pose for which to live as in
our younger days we had
silly dreams about trying
through love to help make
the Presbyterian Church, U.
S. a part of the One Body of
Christ.

Qf the Davidson student
body's portion of our genera-
tion can see no leaders to
follow in great purposes, it
is not because we are not
looking. In fact, we know
that we must find a leader
and an ideal somewhere, for

without them we cannot jus-
ufv our existence.

We see only two alterta-
tives; life with a purpose is
one. We cannot endure a life
with no purpose. But the
cause to which we give our-
selves must be worthy of our
all.

The Trustees’ racially dis-
criminatory admission policy
is a major cause of our dis-
illusionment wth the Chris-
tian faith as it is presented
to us here as a possible fo-
cus for our lives,

We used to think Jesus
and his teachings were
worth living for, but we
have been taught by our
Trustees’ policy, perhaps,
thet they are irrelevant.

You certainly cannot ex-
pect an ethic of self-giving
love for all men to be rele.
vant to the admission policy
of a Southern college in 1960
—you cannot base practice
today on naive and soft ideal-
ism like this first century
talk about love.

Outside the church
among humanists, netural-

ists, agnostics, and athe-
ists, we find courageous
stands and love of fellow
men. In the decision of the
Trustees of this church in-
stitution we see “It Is net
in the best interests of
Davidson College. . .”

THE WAW I
SEE IT, THERE 15
BASICALLY NOTHING

WRONG WITH

We do not expect an im-
possible altruism of an or-
ganized group, but we cannot
believe that where there is
No justice, there is neverthe-
less love. Loving a man nec-
essitates giving him at. least
justice.

If the Trustees’ decision
to keep Davidson segregated
is an expression of the depth
and breadth of the spirit of
love which is still alive in
the church's institutions, we
seem to be forced to choose
between the teachings—in
the official practice — of the
church school and the cour-
ageous love of those outside
the church who seem genu-
inely and sacrificially con-
cerned about their fellows.

If we must choose between
love and the church institu-
tions, we choose love be-
cause we need a worthy ideal
to justify our existence.

The Trustees meet on
February 15. We look for
a werthy ideal and for
teadership. We hope to
find them within the
church, but we will net
give eur oll te unwerthy
causes.

If the church - institutions
prove unloving and narrow,
we choose love—wherever it
is real—and we will follow
heroes who are men of love
—wherever they lead us.

chance to look closely at his

desk. There’s a large tele-
phone directory — City of
Washington, D. C.—a 2-inch
stack of mail, a news bulle-
tin in large print which be-
gins “Khrushchev. . .” and a
pencil with which he toys
during his stories.
ARMED MERCHANT SHIPS
He tells a long story about
Wilson and the controversy
over arming merchant ships
in WWI. “. . . Some of us

who were vain enough to
consider ourselves the lead-
ers of the Congress went to
the White House to tell the
President that we would not
be able to sustain his posi-
tion, that we could not defeat
the McLemore bill.

“Wilson listened to each
of us and then said, ‘Gentle-

men, I know that 1 have no
finer friends in the Gongress,
and I value your opinions.
But I have reached the deci-
sion that I must make the
fight, and what is more, I
must ask you to make it for
me. If you persist in your
defeatist attitude, I have, no
hope of success. At Prince-
{on we always thought we'd
lose our football games with
Harvard, and I can’t ever re-
member beating them. But
when we played Holy Cross.
we always thought we'd win,
and’ we beat them every
time.’

“By the time the Presi-
dent had finished, he had
convinced me and, I guess,
the others, that we shouldn't
have wasted the damn fel-
low's time. We went. back to
the Hill ready to make the

fight, and we beat the devil
out of our foes in the Con-
gress!”

“TOO DAMN BRILLIANT”

He goes on to talk about
President Kennedy (“That
young fellow doesn’t know
what he's in for") and presi-
dential advisor Arthur Sch-
lesinger (‘‘He’s too damn
brilliant; I’m scared of him.”)

When he’s not looking at
you, you're studying him
closely. You notice that
he’s getting old; you think
he must be close to 85.
His hair is pure white, but
he still has the slanted eye.
brows and angular features
by which he was recognized
in cartoons.

SHARED GREATNESS

His speech is deliberate
and comes with an effort,
but it’s the same patrician
accent which explained war-
time policy to millions of
Americans. The thought
strikes you that greatness—:
shared—never grows old. and
your’. mind wanders off in
pursuit of a clever way of
saying that.

By 11:20 you’re back on
the street; laughing about be-
ing slapped on the back by
the Secretary of State and
“shaking the hand that shook
the hand. . .” but the idea
of barging in on greatness
sticks with you. and you de-
cide to recommend it to oth-
ers. You know that this hour
has given you a contact with
real greatness, and you know
the memory of it will recur
many times.

A Midwinters Fantasy:
Love Among The Cools

By ERVIN DUGGAN

“I took a dive in Children’s Lit to come down here.
she said. “Miss Grumb thinks I’m in bed with mono.”
She was drinking Scotch and every time she lifted
the paper cup her charm bracelet jangled faintiy.
“What is the name of that combo?” she said, trac-
ing a circle on the floor with her Weejun.

And I said, “They are the Dumpers.”
And she said, “Oh. They were at Fancy Dress, at

the Phi Deit house ”

1 gazed at her, and | said: “Yeah.”
The big room was dim and crowded and the Dump-

ers were loud.

“Tell me about yourself,” I said.

“Well, there’s nothing to tell, really. 'm majoring
in Elementary Ed but | do not want to teach. | like
the Masters and the Camden Cup. And | have spent
all the summers since my puberty at Ocean Drive.”

“That’s enough for me,” I said, and 1 thought, she

has a soul.

For a moment we watched the dancers and the
drinkers and the vocal group, which had formed a
human pyramid with Mamie, the star, on top.

Mamie was beating on the ceiling with a pair of

red shoes, and it was rhythmical.

I said, “Let’s dance,” and she put down the cup.
and patted her French twist.

“O.K.,” she said.

In a minute we were dancing; her stitched-down

pleated skirt was swirling.

Once, she stepped on my Weejun and she said,
“Did | step on your Weejun?”
And | smiled and said, “No, it was my fault. !

stepped on your Weejun ”

And once she brushed close to me and she inhaled

and said, “English Leather?”

“No, Bay Rum,” I answered and I looked at her
through my shades, deep into her shades, and we saw

each other.

The music slowed and the Dumpers played Watusi

“Let’s tip on out,” I Whispered.

“Oh, yes,” she said brea

hlessly, “Let's tip.”

I put on my London Fog and helped her into her
camel-color polo coat and we left.

And in the car, in the close darkness of the back
seat, she removed her shades and there her eyes were,
and her charm bracelet jangled and we made out.

Once, toward dawn, she sat up and said, “What's

‘vacuity’? Do you know what ‘vaculty’ means?
“No,” I said. “Don’t think about it.” So we made

out some more.

The Dumpers were still playing but it sounded
very distant and I was thinking: This is It.
