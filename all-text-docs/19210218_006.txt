DAVIDSON SUFFERS LOSS IN| Rev. John D. Gillespie, ‘10, has moved
DEATH OF DR. WILSON from Effingham, S. C., to Montreat, N.
JAMES McKAY C., on account of his health.

Prominent Minister of S. C. Passes
Away After Long Service at
Davidson College.

Rev. Wm. C. Rourk, '16, has changed
his residence from, Charlotte to Ellerbe,
tN. C.

Rev. D. C. Young, '15, is now in Char-

.Wilson James McKay, ‘68, was born
in Summerville, South Carolina, in 1848.
He entered Davidson at an early age

and made a brilliant record as a student |-

here. He was a member of. the Phi
Society and won a Junior Rep, Debater’s
Medal, and was the valedictorian in his
senior year.

After leaving Davidson Dr. McKay
entered the Columbia Theological Sem-
inary from which he graduated in 1873.
As a preacher he was sound, scholarly,
and satisfactory. He held the pastorate
in a number of places.

Dr. Thornton Whaling pays him the
following tribute: “Perhaps his chief
work was the great contribution which |
he made as an admistrator and exec-
utive on the boards of two of our chief
educational institutions. For a long
period he was on the board of trustees |
and executive committee of Davidson
College and it is believed that the splen-
did and growing success of that noble
school owes much to the wisdom, fore-
sight, and fine grasp of the needed
policies for the day which this honored
brother gave without stint to this school
of which he was an alumnus. He ren-|
dered the same kind of service to Col-:
umbia Theological Seminary of which
he was also an alumnus and of whose
board he was a member for many years. '
No member of this board commanded |
greater confidence and influence during |
the entire period of his service upon it.” |

“Back of all this service was the
Christian character of this beloved ;
brother. His strong faith in his God |
and Savior, his genuine love for the
Christian brotherhood and the unfail-
ing hope which nothing could obscure
made him a marked Christian saint and
minister.”

Dr. McKay died at his home in Sum-,
ter, S.C. on December 10, 1920. In him
Davidson lost a loyal friend and a ready
helper.

Memorial Recolution to Rev. W. J. Mc-
Kay, D.D.

This page of the minute book of the
faculty of Davidson College is by order
of the faculty affectionately dedicated to
the memory of W. J. McKay, D.D., of
Sumter, S. C., a trustee of this college
for 46 years.

Dr. McKay was elected by the Har-
mony Presbytery in 1875 as its first rep-
resentative on the board of trustees and
served continuously as the representa-
tive of this Presbytery to the day of his
death, December 10, 1920. He was presi-
dent of the board of trustees and chair-
man of the executive committee from
1894-1905 inclusive, and secretary of the
board from 1905 to his death.

His service on the board was for a
longer time than that of any other mem-
ber of whom we know except that of his
predecessor in the secretaryship, Rev.
Jethro Rumple, D.D., whose service was
longer by only one year. .

Dr. McKay's interest in the college
which was his Alma Mater remained un-
abated through this long service. Un-
tiring in his zeal and unfailing in his
loyalty he rendered his Church a great
and splendid service in his work for the
college.

Our gratitude goes out to the kindly
Providence who spared His servant to
us for so long a period of most useful
and helpful service.

It is ordered that a copy of this
resolution be sent to his family for
whose comfort and consolation we of-
fer our prayers in this their time of
bereavement.

(Signed) J. M. McConnell, Secretary.

You tell ’em, Camels,

OU get to smoking Camels because you

appreciate their fine, refreshing flavor!
And, you like them better all the time because
they never tire your taste!

Camels quality makes Camels so appetiz-
ing, so continuously delightful. And, Camels
expert blend of choice Turkish and choice Do-
mestic tobaccos gives them that wonderful
mellow mildness!

_ And, man alive, how you will prefer Camels
to either kind of tobacco smoked straight!

You have only to compare Camels with any
cigarette in the world at any price to know
personally that Camels are a revelation!

When you flash a deck of
Camels you tell the world
you’re smoke-wise!

Camels are sold everywhere in scientifically
sealed packages of 20 cigarettes for 20 cents.
