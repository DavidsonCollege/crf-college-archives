The DAVIDSONIAN, March 1, 1916

FOUR MORE LECTURES IN
SERIES GIVEN BY FACULTY

On March 11, Dr. George De Roulac
Hamilton, of the University of North
Carolina, will give to the students the
next lecture in the series begun by Dr.
Sledd. He is making a trip among the
colleges of North Carolina and neigh-
boring states in the interest of the In-
ternational Conciliation Movement, and
will speak on some subject connected
with this movement.

About the middle of March, Prof. W.
M. Thorn, formerly of Davidson, now
of the University of Virginia, will lec-
ture. This will probably be a stereopti-
can lecture on the Panama Canal, which
he visited a few years ago.

In the latter part of March or the
first of April there will be a lecture given
by a Washington man connected with
the Department of Forest Reserve. “The
lecture will probably be on Forestry and
especially on the Appalachian Forest Re-
serve in this state.

During April, Mr. O. O. Atto, offi-
cial in charge of the Weather Bureau at
Charlotte, will give a lecture on the
various work in that line. He will use
a very interesting collection of lantern
slides. ‘This lecture will close the series
for the year.

DR. McCONNELL SPEAKS
AT Y. M.C. A. MEETING

The Y. M. C. A. proposes to have
several Jectures on interesting subjects at
their regular Thursday night meetings
during the spring term. Last ‘Thursday
night Dr. J. W. McConnell held the
audience with an interesting discourse on
hygiene and its application to the college
man of today. Practically the entire stu-
dent body was present and derived much
benefit from the lecture. Dr. McCon-
nell put the proposition up to the stu-
dents ‘as a matter of duty. Nature brings
one into the world in a normal, healthy
condition and he should do everything
possible to aid nature and keep his body
in as good condition as possible, as it is
in truth the temple of the Holy Spirit.

GOLF TOURNAMENT
THIS SPRING

The annual golf tournament will be-
gin this year on March 20. Following
the plan of last vear the elimination will
be by means of the handicap. Begin-
ning with the last week of February,
each contestant will be required to play
at least ten nine-hole rounds. The score
in these preliminaries must be handed
to the secretary of the club, J. H. Car-
son, and will be used in determining the
winner in the handicap. After — the
handicap a foursome will be played.

McNamara, the well known golf pro-
fessional, will probably play a round or
two on the local course before the close
of the season. This will be an exhibi-
tion game and will no doubt be witness-
ed by many golf enthusiasts.
