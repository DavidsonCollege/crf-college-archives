"Kittens Blessed

With Deep Bench

By DAVE TIERNEY
Sport ‘Writer

Although the great majori-
ty of Davidson students are
quite familiar with ‘the
starting five,"’ quite often a
-truly important element of
‘basketball is forgotten.

- No team can really pos-

Sess great potential without —

an adequate bench. Perhaps
this is why Coach ‘Neill Mc-
Geachy and Coach Terry
‘Holland have calfed this
year’s freshman team the
best ever, —

Head resiinian - “Gvach
McGeaehy Has stated lie
has been moreethan pledsed

- with— Davidson's —"‘unsung
herbes” as he refers to his
bench. He is certain they
are going to play a major
role in the success of this
year’s Wildkittens.

The ‘Kittens ‘‘unsung he-
roes” are led this year by
such players as Gordon
Glasgow, Peyton Prospere,
Bob Vander Griend and Bob
‘Bowman. “I have really

“Bowman

Prospere,
mented. ‘

The ‘Kittens opened their

season last Saturday, and

sure enough bench support

helped the team tremendous-
ly, as_they defeated previo-
usly unbeaten (3-0) Mon-

treat-Anderson Junior Col-
lege, 85-78. Glasgow played

eleven mintiteg~ "and had
eiglit rebounds,

Everyone else aiso had a
hand in the vietéry:Vander-
Griend liad to start .in the
place of T. J. Betorak, out

with: a torn muscle in his.

thigh. And Prospere played
most of the game when
some of the starters got in
foul trouble.

—“T-really -was--imipressed ——--————-

with the play of our sub-
stitutes in last weeks game,”
said McGeachy. “Of course

: our starters also did a good
- been-impressed-with the play job. You must consider

of these men,”’
‘Geachy has commenied.

Giasgow, at 64, is one af
tHe tallest members of this
year’s tedm. ‘‘We don't real:
ly have a big man, so We
have to count on rebounds
from everyone.” Glasgow
has been quite an effective
rebounder for the ‘Kittens.
And although he doesn't
shoot much, he can be very
effective from ‘the floor.

‘Vander Griend at 6-8, the
talles’ man on the squad,
is also being counted on
heavily for defense and re-
bounds.

Bowman and Prospere, a.

pair of guards,’ have also

was their sixth gamie."'
Steve Gadaire was singled
out ds Having af exception:
al perforthancé:

“I believe ‘we still have
two important things to ini-
prove, our pressure defense
and our man to man de-
fense. Montreat forced us to
go to a zone defense to stop
them,"" he commented.

The freshmen play their
next two games here in the
Davidson gym. Before the
Mercer game _ tomorrow.
they face Evans, and next
Tuesday they tangle with
Gaston, preceeding the Rich-
mond game.

Cats Sweep Opene

By ERNIE SHIPE
Sports Editor’ —
If you made it a habit to
leave ball games early last
yedr or never bothered’ to
see the freshman play, you

wouldnt recognize the new _

look in Davidson basketball.
’ A new group of faces play-

ed like the ones you watch-.

ed last season defeating
East Carolina, 77-61, in Wed-
nesday's “season opener. |
The victory meant a giant
step in Davidson's quest for
their fourth consecutive con-

ference championship. |

East Carolina had been
tabbed by several experts
as the most likely candidate
to dethrone the Wildcats.
Even with Bryan Adrfan and
Eric Mirkin sidelined with
injuries, the ‘Cats.
looked like last season's edi-
tion in their win. ;

‘Eric Minkin may find it
even harder to break back
into the “line-up as his re-

placement,* Jee -Sutter—led—! 5

all scorers with 25 points.
The 6-7 sophomore hit six of
17 shots from the field and
was good on 13 of 14 free

throws.

From there on out the

scoring was balanced. ‘Ron |

Stelzer and Steve Kirley
each added 12 points while
John Pecorak tossed in 11.
Jan Postma and Billy Pierce
rounded out the scoring with
nine and eight respectively.

‘East Carolina was paced
by Al Faber, who tallied 18
and Jim Fairley | with 12.
The loss dropped the Pirates
record to 1-2. ~

Davidson was in com-
mand from the outset of the
contest: building their lead

to 15 points with four min- -

utes remaining in the half
only to see the Pirates trim
it to 41-30 at the buzzer. |
- The only time East Caro-
lina came close in the se-
cond half was at 6:32 when ©
they pulled within ten points —

fifteen foot jumper by Sut-_
ter and a layup by Postma “

in a thirty second span was

often -

enough to pad the margin.
Both teams shot well fro

the floor as the ‘Cats

on 48 per cent of their shots

while the Pirates managed

a hot 51 per-cent.
