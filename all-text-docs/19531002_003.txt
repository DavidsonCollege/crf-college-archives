FRIDAY, OCTOBER'?, 1958

Although Davidson's
football Wildcats are
taking a breather this
weekend there are still
plenty of things being
said in the dailies and
on the campus con-
cerning their showings
in two games which
have been played to
date. We would like to
pass along one such
comment which was
made by an observer
at the Davidson-Geor-
gia Tech contest.

AL STATE SCRAP_ (Varsity Takes Rest

~ T Before State Clash

By JIM HOLSHOUSER

The 1953 edition of the Davidson Freshman football team
was unveiled for the first time here yesterday in a scrimmage
game with the Davidson varsity. The contest ran for approxi-

none other than the
line coach of the Yellow Jackets mighty football machine,
Ray Graves. In a recent issue of the Atlanta Journal, Graves
was asked to pick out the play of the week in Tech football
fortunes. That week happened to be the week of Davidson’s
visit to the home of gridiron giants.

We would like to quote here in part this article by Tech’s
line mentor:

“The key play must be differentiated from the most
spectacular play. The, key play may be one so pushed
into the background by more obvious and exciting plays
that the layman overlooks it. The key play of a game is
one which may open or close the door to victory.

“In the Davidson game it was virtually impossible
to single out any one play as the turning point of the
game. The most important factor in that game came when
Georgia Tech registered more and better football players
than were registered at Davidson. I mention this be-
cause it will be the last time this season that I will have
the opportunity to say this. WE OUT-MANNED BUT
DID NOT OUT-FIGHT A SMALLER DAVIDSON SQUAD.”

_ Coming from the source that it did, this, it seems to me,
is one of the biggest compliments that could have been paid
to the Davidson team. As yet the Cats have not been able to

Eleven fraternities and the Campus Club are getting

Coach Pete Whittle’s Cross-Country team will open their
season against a strong Maryville College team next Friday

The freshmen, however, gave no-
tice that they will be winning some
games this season. Though lacking
in experience, they showed a lot
of fight and hustle.

has been moved to his old quarter-
back post after being shifted to
the halfback slot last week. Jim
Thacker, the swift-footed little
scooter who won All-Conference
honors last year, ran at his usual
left halfback post. Harley Smith,
who transferred from Alabama
last year, got the nod for the other
halfback position. Leroy Fargason
completed the Cats’ new backfield.

After the lay-off this weekend,
the Wildeats are pointing for that
big contest at Raleigh next Sat-
urday. The game with North Caro-
lina State is always an important
one on the Davidson schedule and
one that the Cats would really like
to take. The Wolfpack lost to

hit their stride, having dropped the first two, but a good

season is still certainly very

much possible and probable.

Having only three games in the home stadium this year is
naturally a great disadvantage to the Cats’ moral, but they’re
still giving it all they’ve got and are playing some fine foot-
ball as is attested by Coach Graves’ article.

Racketeers

Organize

For Fall Workouts

Monday afternoon the Davidson tennis team held its first
meeting of the season. Coach McKee says his team might not
prove as strong this year as a team but the individuals are

looking very good.

This year the team will feel the
loss of two very capable seniors,
Dudley and Bivins. However, those
men returning this year are very
much improved. Corky Johnson,
the number six man, was worthy
of special praise.

Better Organization

This season the team will be
much better organized. During the
fall 10 men will be lined up as
the varsity. A man cah either ad-
vance to number one or fall out
of the top ten depending upon

Auburn Lambeth
Signed By Hamilton
in Canadian Loop

Auburn Lambeth, former David-
son football great, has been signed
by the Hamilton (Ontario) Tiger
Cats of the Canadian Professional
Footbal] League for play this sea-
son.

While in his collegiate career
at Davidson, Lambeth was ac-
claimed as one of the finest passers
in the nation. He received a na-
tional award on this basis.

Lambeth hails from Peoria, Il,
and entered the ranks of the Ca-
nadian team immediately after his
discharge from the service. -

In an early pre-season exhibition
game against Montreal, the ex-
Davidson ace threw the winning
touchdown pass for the well-re-
spected Ti-Cats. He stands as their
second string quarterback.

The former Wildcat quarterback
graduated from Davidson in 1961.

his ability to beat the man pre-
ceding him.

In this way there will be com-
petition all through the season
among the players, allowing every-
one an equal opportunity to win
a place on the team.

Coach McKee was very pleased
with his freshman prospects.
among them two men, John Rob-
inson and John Thorpe stand out
as very good players and possible
replacements next year of Bremer
and Johnson. As there will be no
J.V. team this year the freshmen
will be organized on the same basis
as the varsity. Those freshmen out
for tennis include C. L. Cooper,
J. C. Winfrey, F. C. Roberts, J. S.
Robinson, J. Thorpe and Mercer
Blankenship.

Six Returning Varsity Men

Members of the varsity who will
see action again this year include
Corky Clark, John Bremer, Lacy

This fall’s activities will be led
off by the traditional tag football
season. Three games a day will be
played Monday through Friday, be-
ginning at 4 o’clock in the after-
noon. Last year’s football competi-
tions were ended with the Sigma
Chis in first place, Phi Delta Theta
in second and the Kappa Sigs and
Pikas tied for third position.

Phi Delts Topped

The final year’s total for the

1952-53 winning Phi Delts was
1138 points, a record which all the
teams will be aiming to top this
year. . ,
This year a new playing field
has been layed out in order to take
the place of Watts field, which will
be occupied by construction of the
new dormitory. The new field,
number 3, is situated on the golf
course, just beyond the creek.

Ten Sports
The same sports will be played
this year as in the past: MAJOR--
football, basketball, softball and

varsity competition; INTERME-
DIATE — wrestling, volleyball,
track and swimming; MINOR—

handball and tennis.

The intramural managers for
this year are: Sigma Chi, J. W.
Kiser; Kappa Sig, George Crone;
Phi Delt, Bill Nelson; KA, Dave
Fowle; Pika, Lindley Beardsley;

Phi Gam, Charlie Hall; ATO, Bob
Stuart; Sig .Eps, Jack Efird; Pi

Kapp, Bob Southwell; Beta, Dan.

McCall; SAE, Steve Norton.

As has been stressed in the In-
tramural Handbook, any injuries
‘sustained during contests or prac-
tices must be the responsibility of
the individual student, not the De-
partment of Intramural Athletics.
It is urged that each student
should have some sort of accident
coverage policy during the school

year.

Coach Whittle has this to say

about intramural sports:
Whittle Co-ordinator

This season, as has been true
for several. years, Coach Pete
Whittle of the Athletic Depart-
ment will very competently co-
ordinate the intramural activities
for the year.

“Every student needs a whole-
‘some outlet for his mental energies
rough physical exercise, and we
invite you to participate in our
program. You will gain a knowl-
edge of, and skill in, several pop-
ular sports by taking an active part
in athletic contests. You will be
better prepared for recreational
participation after your college
days are over.

“Budget your time and play in-
tramurals as often as you like.”

afternoon at 4 o’clock on the local course. This is their only

home meet of the season.

Maryville edged Davidson last
year in a triangular affair with
Davidson and Tennessee, and the
locals will be out for revenge for
that defeat. Maryville will come
here with a strong team; they lost
no men from last year's squad.

; Four Lettermen

Co-Captains Shipley and Sparks
along with returning lettermen
Feeney and Turner will lead the
team against Maryville. Shipley
and Sparks, trophy winners in the
state and conference meets, re-
spectively, should have one of
their best seasons this year.

Dick Lovette, newcomer to the
team this year, has been doihg ex-
ceptionally well in practice. He
will be depended on heavily, along
with John Handley, also a new-
comer.

Alexander, Caudell, Allen, Mce-
Intosh and .Joyner comprise the
remainder of the squad.

Whittle Enthusiastic

Coach Whittle is very enthusi-
astic over the chances of a fine
season. The team won only one
meet last year, but a much im-
proved record is expected this
year.

The team is in’ much better

shape than they were at this time
last year, and should hit their
usual mid-season stride much ear-
lier.The locals might be considered
as a dark-horse contender in the
Conference meet.

Only Home Meet

After the Maryville meet, the
Cats will meet Richmond, W&L,
VPI, W&M, and N.C. State, all
away. They then will participate
in the state and conference meets.

The freshman team under the
leadership of Coach Sam Magill
will also open their season against
Pfiefer Junior College immediate-
ly following the varsity meet.

Ashcraft, Baker, and Kiker will
lead the team against Pfiefer.
These boys finished one, two,
three in the freshman cake race
and will be hard to beat. Gordon
Bondurant has also looked promis.
ing: and will be depended on for a
good showing.

The freshmen have another meet
with Pfiefer and will possibly
meet the Carolina and Duke fresh-
men in a triangular affair. They
will also participate in the fresh-
man state meet, in which Ashcraft
stands a good chance of being one
of the top men.

win. So it should really be a
corker.

without kick-offs or tries for extra
points. The offensive team was
