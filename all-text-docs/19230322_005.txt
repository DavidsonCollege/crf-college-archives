TRINITY TO BE MET IN
FORENSIC STRUGGLE

The intercollegiate debate with Trinity
will take place in Shearer Hall on the ev-
ening of April 27th. The subject will be
“Resolved that the issuance of tax exempt
securities should be forbidden by an amend-
ment to the Federal Constitution.” David-
son will defend the negative side of this
query. ;

A large number of men have expressed
their intention of going out for this debate.
The preliminaries take place in Phi Hall
Friday evening, March 23rd, Although all
of those who will take part in the prelim-
inaries are new to intercollegiate contests,
yet they are men who have had much expe-
rience in the literary societies here in col-
lege and who are fitted in every way to up-
hold the forensic honor of Davidson. The
most prominent of those who intend to try
out are Baldwin, Cox, Elkins, Burney and
Bradford.

This will, in all probability, be the only
intercollegiate debate of the term, .the pro-
posed one with Wake Forest having fallen
through. However, the Debating Council
is still trying to secure another, The inter-
collegiate record of avidson is one to be
proud of. Since 1909 she has won eleven
and lost nine.

EUMENEAN SOCIETY
HAS BUSINESS MEETING

The Eumanean literary saciety held its
regular mecting Thursday night after the
life service sermon by Doctor Clark. The
regular program was omitted and the meet-
ing was given over to business,

The Society decided to invest in a pin
more elaborate and more expensive than
the pin first presented to the society by the
committee.

George McLean was appointed to se-
cure designs and prices to present to the So-
ciety. The Eumanean wants a distinctive
pin and a pin each member will wear with
pride. After disposing with various minor
details of business the society adjourned.

PANDEINIC SOCIETY HAS
INTERESTING PROGRAM

As the Pandeinic Society meeting was
scheduled for the same night that the fire
took place in the Eu Hall, the members
withdrew in favor of the prevailing smoke
and the scene of activity was shifted to
Dr. Sentelle’s class room.

The change, however, in environment
did not affect the meeting unfavorably as
it was quite up to par. The subject for de-
bate was: “Resolved, That Ulster should
join the Irish’ Free States.” The affirma-
tive was represented by Ford and Hollings-
worth; the negative by Milton and Year-
gan. The negative won the decision of both
the house and the judges.

Warren Cox delivered an oration on “The
Truth and Cause of the Divorce Evil.” He
brought out strongly the fact that it is not
in the divorce laws that the cause of reme-
dy lies, but in ourselves. It is only through
regeneration of the morals of the nation
that this menace to the, foundation of our
civilization can be driven out.

C. A. Young rendered the current events.
At this meeting plans were adopted for an
individual diploma plate for the society. So
that the members who graduate this year
and hereafter shall receive diplomas print-
ed by their own plate.

GAMMA SIGMA EPSILON
INITIATES THREE MEN

The Gamma Sigma Epsilon chemical fra-
ternity held it regular meeting Friday,
March 16th.

The headliner on the program was the
initiation of three new members, all of
whom have, stood out prominently along
chemical lines in their coflege activities.
The three initiates were R. R. Jones, W.
Z. Bradford and Marion Murray.

The goat’ never bumped quite as pleas-
ingly before, and the greased pole, which
was climbed by the three aspirants, was
greasy as soap on a railroad track. Much
meterial good, as well as amusement, was
received by both the initiates and the initi-
ators. Consequently , the new members
carried a pensive mood around with them
the next day.

Refreshments of a high order were serv-
ed and enjoyed by all. The three faculty
members present: Dr. Arbuckle, Professor

Dhies and Professor Currie, carried the

same satisfied smiles as the students when
the repast was completed. Many chemical
improvements in the constituents of the
food were suggested, but no one seemed
so dissatisfied as to desist from partaking
of it.

Much benefit was gained by the exchange
of ideas and by the short talks from Dr.
Arbuckle, Professor Currie and Professor
Thies. The new brothers, who had been
wearing their “test tubes” around for sev-
eral days, were complimented upon their at-
tainments in chemistry and were wished
much success by the faculty members.

SENIORS’ PETITION TO *
FACULTY IS DECLINED

The petition of the Senior class to be al-
lowed to attend church services under the
honor system, after being carefully consid-
ered by the Executive Committee, did not
feel justified in annulling a law of the in-
stitution which has been in force since
the founding of the institution.

It was in order to preserve this custom
of compulsory attendance at the morning
service that the college went to the expense
of building an addition to the church. Un-
til this was completed, the Senior class was
put on its honor to attend either the morn-
ing or evening service, each man reporting
his own absence. But now -that sufficient
room has been provided so that all the stu-
dents may attend the morning service, the
faculty feels that the present Senior class
should submit to the old ruling.

In submitting their decision, the Commit-
tee said that they had faith in the Senior
class to believe that they would carry out
their promises, and that this was not the
faculty’s reason for declining their peti-
tion.

QUEER TURKISH TRIBE
INHABITS WEST’S HALL

The burning of Watts has led to the
taking of the parlor of West by a strange
Nomadic tribe of Turks. The head of this
tribe is Sheik Halidad Karavan Russell,
with his famous harem. He has decorated
his new dwelling place in truly oriental
fashion and there with his many wives he
resides peacefully.

The women are reported to be the fairest
ever gathered around a Sheik throne. Most
of them are gifts from the Sultan of Tur-
key, Okeida Jabel Allison, and they are
said to be very loving and affectionate.

Since coming into America they have
discarded most of the Turkish customs
prevalent among women of harems. One
of them however, Willide Jerusalem Cooper,
still persists in wearing her uniform of the
Royal Order of ‘Turkish Cosmetics, of
which she was a prominent*member. The
movement of this organization is somewhat
similar to that of the American Suffra-
gettes. She is much too ambitious to be
very loving and the Sheik spends most of
his leisure hours in the company of his
other two beauties, Jezebelidid CcCutchen
and Jabezine McCallum.

The Sheik is very fond and proud of his
harem and when the haze of smoke aris-
ing from his Cubeb cigarette is lifted he
may be seen on his exalted throne in the
tender embrace of his three loving, wives.

Dramatic Club to Publish

hoped that this will be established as

an annual custom,

By this means the work of the club
will be published and made known to
other similar organizations, and
through mutual constructive criticism
dramatic work will advance even more
than it has in the past. It has been
only recently that dramatics have taken
the important place that they now hold.
To a large extent the work is replac-
ing the glee clubs and similar organi-
zations, and is an improvement over
any such organization. With the
backing of the English department and
especially of Dr. E. J. Erwin, who is
the power behind the scenes, the Club
is undeniably forging ahead.

It is but another step in the develop-
ment of literary work for it gives op-
portunity to both the actor and the

writer.

The Movie management has announced
that the picture for this week will be “When
Knighthood Was in Flower.” The story
pictures in palpitant life and action the
greatest love narrative in English history.
Shakespeare probably knew the romance
of Mary Tudor, but as she was a near rel-
ative of Queen Elizabeth, he did not dare
immortalize her in one of his historic dra-
mas. The task remained for an American
author of modern times—Charles Major.
From his exhaustive studies of English
History he ressurrected this stirring romance
of the Tudor days. .. _

One of the most thrilling and the most
trying on the director was the tournament
scene in which mounted knights dash at
each other with drawn lances. Another
thriller is where Charles Brandon and
Princess Mary make a leap of thirty feet
on horseback into the river.

As Princess Mary Tudor, Marion Davies
has by far the most important role of her
screen carreer. In the role of the capri-
cious sister of Henry VIII, who defies two
kings and spurns a throne in orde rto mar-
ry the man she loves, Miss Davies has a
role which requires the finest kind of act-
ing.

AN OVERSIGHT

We are proud of the fact that we
are gentlemen at Davidson College.
We hear this fact on all sides and
are conceited enough to believe it.

The most perfect mechanism gets
out of order sometimes, good plans
have flaws, the good, all-round man
has his blemishes. Yet, if they be
pointed out to him, he is glad to alter
his machinery, change an item in his
plans, and alter a deficiency in his
character.

Many times in church it may be
hot, and we are uncomfortable; it

year’s captain, will probably take care
of the 440. Cromartie and Nappy Da-
vis are showing up well on the middle
distances, and it is likely that one of
these men will find a place on the squad
to complete the trio of middle distance
men.

In the sprints and distances Coach
Grey will have to rely largely on new
men. Williford and Selser did some
excellent running last fall with the
cross-country squad and are making
the others hustle for places in the mile
and two-mile.

With the loss of Ted Koenig due to
an operation, and Jim Hendrix via
baseball, the sprints are’still wide open.
Smith and Crane are promising new
men, and with some hard work ought
to come near filling the vacancies.
Smith has the ideal sprinter’s build,
combined with a pretty stride. Satur-
day was his first day out, but the show-
ing he has already made makes him
appear as the best prospect in the speed
events. Cox, Bouvier and Dick are
making Crane and Smith work for
their laurels.

The high-hurdles will be amply
taken care of by Streibich and Gracey,
both veterans of former years; but a
man for the low hurdles has yet to be
selected from Parish, Sam Davis, Mal-
loy and Dick. The latter was a low
hurdler a couple of seasons back, but
it is doubtful if he can get back into
shape in time to run that even this year,

The schedule this years calls for
four hard meets, all of them with old
rivals on the cinder path. As arrang-
ed by Manager Gallaway, it stands
as follows:

April 5th, South Carolina at Col-
umbia,

April 14th, N. C. State at Raleigh.

April 20th, Clemson at Davidson.

May 4th and 5th, Olympic Games
at Durham.

GASTONIA DELEGATES

On Sunday, March 11th, a depu-
tation was sent out by the Chris-
tian Endeavor Training Class to
whe First Presbyterian Church of
Gastonia. It was “composed of
two efficient members of the class,
WwW. A. Gamble and T. C. Barr.
They each made a brief talk to the
Sunday School, after which they
were given classes to teach. Gamble
was fortunate enough to be alloted
a girls’ class. In the afternoon a
conference was held with the offi-
cers and committee chairmen of
the Senior C. E. Society. They
talked at the meetings of both the
Senior and the Intermediate En-
deavor Societies and later spoke at
the evening church service.

The Endeavor work was started
‘n Gastonia about a year ago by
one of the members of this deputa-
tion, W. A. Gamble. At this time
he organized a Senior Society
which has flourished and grown
and which has been the nucleus
around which other societies have
been formed, so that at present
there are three societies, Junior,
Senior and Intermediate.

chased a new Ford coupe.
