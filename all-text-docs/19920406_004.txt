Alumnus Cites History
of Patterson Court Indiscretions

In spite of the frosty Spring Frolics weather, the editors couldn't help feeling
cheery about the coming season. Azaleas bloom this week at The Masters,
baseball teams await tomorrow's "Opening Day," and basketball crowns its
champion tonight. If these sports events fail to convince you of the majesty
of Spring, keep in mind that exams will be over exactly one month from
today.

O Sweet spontaneous
earth how often have
the

doting

fingers of
prurient philosophers pinched
and
poked

thee

, has the naughty thumb
of science prodded

thy

beauty .how
often have religions taken
thee upon their scraggy knees
squeezing and

buffeting thee that thou mightest conceive
gods

(but
true

to the incomparable
couch of death thy
rhythmic

lover

thou answerest

them only with

spring)

To the editor,

I write inresponse to the
articles, editorials, and ad-
vertisements concerning the
Select Committee reportand
the resulting sanctions
against Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon. Some historical back-
ground is necessary to show
the problem which the com-

mittee addressed is by no_

means a new one. I hope,
then, that you will permit an
alumnustoreminisce. Idon’t
know firsthand what’s going
on at Davidson now. I only
know whathappened when I
wasastudent. Begging your
indulgence, here is what I
would have told the Select
Committee:

Next to 5 Patterson
Court, the SAE house, is 6. I
don’tknow what 6 Patterson
Courtis now, but when I was
a student it was the site of
ATO, the defunct fraternity
metamorphosed into a soon-
to-be-defunct ‘coed eating
house. It was my house.
Then as now, the gentleman
atnumber 5 participated ina
“friendly rivalry” with their
equally clean-cut and
starched counterparts at KA.
The people next door to
ATO, however, were not
rivals, friendly or otherwise.
Rivalry, you see, presumes a
perception of equality, and
however group conscious-
ness at number 5 perceived
their gentle, guitar-strum-

‘ming, poetry-reading next:

door neighbors, it was notas
equals. Rivalry was there-
fore impossible. Contempt
took its place, and was dis-
played brutally. Here are
some of the incidents I wit-
nessed, and the responses to
them which I also witnessed.

Item: Every year at
homecoming, the clan of
SAEs pastand present would
gather after the game for
tribal rituals which lasted
well into the small hours of
the morning, and which in-
cluded approximately one-
half gross of bottles of cham-
pagne. Over the course of
the afternoon and evening,
said bottles would be pro-
gressively emptied and then
jettisoned onto the rear porch

of number 6. Any ATO’s
gently summing guitars or
reading poetry in the house
at the time did so to the ac-
companiment of empty
champagne bottles crashing
and shattering on concrete.
By morning the ATO patio
was thickly and evenly car-
peted with shards of green
glass.

Why didn’t we ask them
to stop? Why didn’t we
protest to the Dean? We did,
actually; it was part of an-
other ritual. ~ We would
complain to Will, and a few
days later we would receive
a suitably contrite letter of
apology from the clean-cut,
starched, and pleasantly
well-mannered incumbent
chapter president.
real sorry,” he would tell us
privately. “We’ll do what
we can.”

Item: Once, a few of us
got presumptuous enough to
venture a gesture of “friendly
rivalry” toward our neigh-
bors. We engaged the Phi
Delts (who raised money
doing this sort of thing) to
raid the SAE house and as-
sault the brethren assembled
at dinner with whipped
cream pies.. No physical
damage was to be done. It
was good, clean fun--an
expression of “friendly ri-
valry.” But how could we
forget--how dare we forget-

- that an expression of ri- ©

valry is an assertion of equal-
ity. The next day the SAE’s
raided the ATO house. They
overturned tables. They
raided the kitchen and broke
platesand glasses. Itbrought
to mind Kristallnacht in
Germany in 1938. Ourhouse
manager went to the Dean.
He wouldn’t take any ac-
tion. the SAE’s were only
getting even, he said. We
should have known better,
he said.

Item: Patterson Court
houses, as you know, are
only equipped with one
restroom accessible to the
public. This creates diffi-
culties on ceremonial occa-
sions when scores have been
consuming powerfully diu-

“We're:

retic beverages in order to
induce, the trance appropri-
ate for to such occasions.
The devotees of Minerva at
number 6 had, over time,
evolved a neat solution to
this delicate problem. These
women imported for cultic

_festivities (who, it was

hoped, would participate in
still more arcane rituals later
in the evening) were directed
in their need to the facilities
next door. The brothers,
perhaps deeming itunmanly
to closet themselves during
these celebrations of viril-
ity, relieved themselves in
front of, upon, and through
the basement windowsof the
ATO house. The Dean, to
his credit, was somewhat
more forthcoming on ‘this
point. Any individual that-
we observed in:the act, and
that we were subsequently
able to identify would be
fined asum of $75. 00 under
the Code of Responsibility.
Of course, no action was to
be taken against the SAEs
collectively. So we oblig-
ingly posted asentinel armed
with a camera, and sure
enough we caught a. sur-
prised SAE on film. His
fraternity nickname was
“Stork.” We produced pho-
tographic evidence to the
inaccuracy of conventional
wisdom about tall men, but
because it became impracti-
cable and unreasonable to
garrison an observer at the
house until dawn onallsuch
occasions.

Item: The very same term,
the Phi Delt house was taken
off the list of designated
drinking areas, because two
individuals in that organiza-
tion had jumped upanddown
onacar belonging toacol-
lege secretary. The SAEs
did not have to pay to have
our Carpet cleaned once; the
bill came to about $70.00.

. Item: Later in the year, the

SAEs stage a three day bac-
chanal to observe the cen-
tennial of the chapter. The
final tab came to $20,000.
At the party for faculty and
staff on the first day, the
