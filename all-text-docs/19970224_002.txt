SGA President and Vice
President Buster Burk and Ann

Sophomore Ed Winant to the new
position of treasurer.

They appointed Freshman

Joslyn Ogden as Chancellor.

d Traditionally, the chancellor
is paid $800 from the SGA bud-
get.

Because the treasurer will
now take some duties from the
chancellor (control the budget,
- |meet with the Activities Tax Coun-
cil), Burk and Fisher suggested
splitting the funds between the
two.

In a vote Tuesday, the SGA
decided to pay the chancellor $700
and the treasurer $200.

- This will require taking. an
extra $100 from the SGA budget.
When asked about using extra
funds at the meeting Tuesday.

Winant told members of the
SGA that he had not had a chance
to look at the budget yet.

In an interview this weekend,
Winant said that he had still not

lor Lee Burnett to review specif-
ics of the budget.

He thinks that the extra sal-
ary will come from the budget
increase that the SGA voted in
last month.

“Since we will be getting
[around $14,000] instead of
$11,750, it will probably come
directly from that.”

Head Independent Senator
Matthew Hobbie feels that the
raise shows a disturbing trend. “It
seems to me that what they are
doing is splitting the job and giv-
ing a $100 raise. If they are going
to split up the duties they should
split up the money.”

Hobbie feels that the recent
budget increase is not a valid rea-
son to raise salaries.

“There seems to be a lack of
concern for money [recently],” he
says.

Senior class senator Sarah] —
Terry disagrees.

“It seemed to me that the $100
raise is OK because we are adding
responsibility to the positions.”

She says that the treasurer
position was created so that the
SGA can have someone who “is

Community service debated at forum

By ALLISON DoLPH
Staff Writer

Thursday night, a forum on
community service was held in the
Morrison Room of the College
Union to discuss the possibilities of
a service requirement for gradua-
tion, widening service opportuni-
ties to include service learning and
programs abroad, and getting more
people involved.

Stuart Lourd, Director of Com-
munity Service and Associate Dean
of Academic Affairs at DePaul
University, moderated the forum.

About thirty people attended
the discussion, including both stu-
dents and staff, such as President
John Kuykendall, Dean Tom
Shandley, and Assistant Dean for
International Students and Commu-
nity Service Ruth Pittard.

Lourd opened the discussion
witha basic question: “Why are you
here?” Through a show of hands,
everyone at the forum had been
involved in service at some point in
their lives.

Arecurringand divisive theme
at the discussion was the possibility
for a service requirement.

Some people supported insti-
tuting a service requirement as a
valid learning experience that would
enhance the image of the College,
bring people together, and open
doors for students who might not
otherwise have the initiative to be-

gin service.

On the other hand, concerns
were raised over “indentured ser-
vice,” the addition of yet one more
requirement, and the possibility of
endangering our relationship with
the community through a debased
quality of service.

Others pointed to the difficulty
of what would count as service if
the requirement were established.
Some raised the question whether
serving as the coordinator for a ser-

vice project in a fraternity could be -

considered in the same capacity as
tutoring a child at the Ada Jenkins
Center.

Lourd challenged students to
broaden their definition of a com-
munity, contending that whatever
happens on the Davidson college
campus directly impacts the sur-
rounding community.

Although the discussion often
reverted back to the issue of a re-
quirement, Lourd challenged stu-
dents to think of ways to promote
service and accomplish the same
goals without making service man-
datory.

At DePaul University, Lourd
said, the level of students volun-
teering has risen from 300 to 1800
students out of 2100 total. :

I am not convinced that the
invitation to serve has been given,”
Lourd said. He believes stu-
dent participation may increase if
avenues for service are broadened.

Lourd stressed the importance of
“finding your passion” for service.

One possible option discussed
was offering service as a way of
fulfilling the Lifetime PE credit.

Rather than ten hours of aero-
bics or juggling, students could
spend three hours in skill training
and preparation and seven or eight
in practice.

An example of integrating PE
with service would be teaching bas-
ketball to neighborhood children.

Two other issues discussed
were service abroad and service
learning.

Since a large proportion of
Davidson students already go
abroad, a service component could
be-added to their experiences.

In the context of service learn-
ing, each department could include
one course in their offerings that
incorporated service.

Just as students must meet the
Cultural Diversity requirement, stu-
dents could fulfill a service compo-
nent by taking a class in their cho-
sen department.

Lourd pushed students to go
beyond the assignments on the syl-
labus and ask professors for service
opportunities relating to their stud-
ies: “Those who take the initiative
are the pioneers.”

And, to stress the importance
of service, he also adds, “Those
without a vision will perish.”

Galhos will tell story of survival

By Ann Culp

’ News Editor

Bella Galhos, a Timorese hu-
man rights activist, will be speak-
ing about her experiences under the
Indonesian government tonight at 7
p.m. in the 900 Room.

Galhos is one of three East
Timorese in Canada who have es-
caped from what has been called the
worst genocide per capita since the
Holocaust. She has undergone
forced sterilization in the Indone-
sian miliary’s attempt to wipe out
the entire Timorese population. In
addition, her two young brothers
were killed by the military.

To understand Galhos’
struggles is to understand the plight
of East Timor, which was colo-
nized by he Portuguese. On De-
cember 7, 1975, the Portuguese left
East Timor, and the Timorese de-
clared their independence. Just days
later, the Indonesian army invaded
and annexed East Timor, even
though the small country had no
historical ties to Indonesia. Over
the last21 years, more than 200,000
East Timorese-about a third of the

’ ued to deliver arms to Indo-

1975 population-have died.

Although the U.S.
voted for the U.N. resolu-
tion calling for the with-
drawal of Indonesian troops
from East Timor, it contin-

nesia unabated. In 1979,
Noam Chomsky and Edward
Hermantreported that “when
the press deals with Timor it

generally presents as fact the latest
handout of the Indonesian propa-
ganda agencies...or else reports the
iniquity of the resistance, compli-
ments of Indonesian generals.”

The State Department observes
the same conventions in its book
The Washington Connectign and
Third World Fascism. The authors
believe that it is due to Indonesia’s
rejoining of the Free World as a
fully-accredited member and stamp-
ing out of communism in October
1965 that encourages the U.S. to
give support to atrocities. As a
result, Indonesia was armed roughly
90% with U.S. equipment in 1975,
according to deputy Legal Advisor
of the State Department George
Aldrich, =

The 1996 Nobel Peace Prize
was awarded to Jose Ramos-Horta
who has helped to raise awareness
about East Timor. Illegal campaign
contributions were made by Indo-
nesia to the Clinton campaign, while
the Clinton Administration planned
to sell Indonesia nine F-16 fighter
jets. Ramos-Horta claims that sell-
ing weapons to Indonesia “‘is like
sell weapons to Saddam Hussein.”
This sale spurred the Senate to limit
arms sales over the summer.

Ramos-Horta urges “quiet,
firm, and sustained U.S. discussion
with Indonesia. America, the Euro-
pean Union and Australia can pro-
vide the moral leadership to right
the wrong in East Timor with no
cost to them or to Indonesia.”

German Symposium studies Weimar °’s history

from page 1
Weimar continues to be a favorite
haunt of German scholars, 23 of
whom convened on the Davidson
campus Feb. 21-23.
Davidson’s own Weimar

scholar, Burkhard Henke, along

with Susanne Kord of Georgetown
University, and Simon Richter of
the University of Maryland, orga-
nized the symposium, entitled “Cul-
ture Studies: Approaches to the City

of Weimar.”

The purpose of this interna-
tional symposium was “to explore
Weimar culture during the long
eighteenth century (1640-1840) and
showcase that exploration as a
model for German cultural stud-
ies,” as stated in the catalog for the
symposium,

Presenters came to Davidson
from Germany, Canada, and allover
the U.S.

Nineteen papers were pre-
sented, including topics such as
women and music, propaganda and
human rights, class and gender
transgressions, the commodification
of Weimar, and landscape garden-
ing.

Allin all, the symposium was a
huge success, with several present-
ers Citing it as one of the best con-
ferences which they have ever at-
tended.
