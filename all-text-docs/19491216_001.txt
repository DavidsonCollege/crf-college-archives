VOLUME XXXVIII

DAVIS JIN

BIKO-

Once again, amidst a world of
problems, danger, fear and hope,
people are preparing to celebrate
the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Once again, their thoughts turn
m away from the
external troubles
and worries to-
wards a
place, called
Be thlehe m,

the Son of God
was born
bring internal
peace to all hu-

Biedenkopf
man beings.

And in many minds the question
might rise: do we have peace;
did anything change; and if so,
where is the change? We are liv-
ing in a world of disaster, need

and unprotectedness. Many will
have. a happy Christmas, but for
many others Christmas will be sad
and with no sign of hope.

Two great powers are confront-
ing cach other and no one can see
any way of bringing them together.
The ideals of the western nations,
freedom, peace and liberty are over-
shadowed by a tyranny in the east
never before known in the history
of men, Millions of men are starv-
ing and freezing, millions of others
are deprived of their liberty.

And soon after Christmas the old
year will go and the door of time
will open to make the way free for
another ‘year and people will look
forward and ask for the things the
new year will bring. And they will
hope for peace as they did every
time a new year came, but nobody
knows whether their hopes will be
fulfilled. And if you consider all
things that happened in the last year
and all those many efforts that
were made to bring peace and that
failed, chances for such a fulfillment
seem to be so small.

But as you light the canales at
your Christmas tree and as their
warm light fills the room you
might feel that there is still one
great hope left, that cannot be
destroyed by any force whatsoever.
And you might suddenly know that
the message brought to the herds-
men near Bethichem by the angles
from heaven is still living among
men, that it is grown greater and
greater and more powerful. “Peace
to all: men that are of good will.’’

And if this message will always
live among us, if we shall never lose
hope in it, and if the thoughts of
all men meet at this day and their
minds be one, strong in the com-
mon will to make this message

their highest ideal, their greatest |

aim, and if we face the new year
with all its unknown with a strong
faith in God and His decisions,
then these days shall be more than
just a rest, a stop in the course of
life, more than just a time of think-
ing and reconsideration, then there
shall be days bringing new strength
in hope and in will to go on and
carry out the great task laid upon
all of us by our Heavenly Father,
then there shalt be given us in-
ternal peace and security, then
there shall be a real Christmas.

Dr. Boyd Undaunted,
Unhurt By Accident

Dr. Bernard Boyd, returning
from church services held in Char-
lotte Sunday morning to another
service near Mooresville, met with
an accident one mile south of Cor-
nelius.

Due to a thick fog, traffic was
moving slowly, with the exception
of a Sarge truck traveling in the
middie of the road. Dr Boyd
swerved to the right, off the road.
On turning the car back on the
road, the edge of the road cayght
the wheels, rolling the car over
twice to the opposite side of the
road. Dr. Boyd was uninjured, .but
the car was damaged considerably.

A few minutes after the accident,
Whit Cobb arrived at the scene on
his way to Charlotte. Cobb took
Dr. Boyd to Mooresville, where,

Bob Gay of the junior class has |!

recently been informed that he is
the winner of one of the very selec-
tive scholarships offered by the

tion for these scholarships was
very keen and Bob is to be con-
gratulated for his achievement. The

scholarship, pays up to a maximum |

of $200 on the student’s tuition.

To be cligible, an interested stu-
dent who has had two years of col-
lege, applies to the company for

— o>-

ten weeks of summer work in the|'

form of on-the-job-training. At

the end of this trial period, and]

if scholastic standings are of merit,
competitive interviews are held with
company officials, Such was the
procedure Bob went through to
gain the award. He now has the
privilege of continuing with the
Jewel Tea Co., in his summer work
and has excellent chances of a
position with the company upon
graduating.

Bob is a well-known member of
his class and is very active in stu-
dent activities. He recently took
time off from his duties as a mem-
ber of Phi Gamma Delta social
fraternity and members. of the
YMCA cabinet to accept the job

Vocational School
Enrollment Rises

While veterans’ enrollment in
North Carolina colleges and uni-
versities under the GI Bill and Pub-
lic Law 16 (for the disabled) again
this year show a decrease, enroll-
ments in other type schools and
in the farm training program show
rapid gains.

As of December I, college and
university veteran enrollments were
about 2] per cent below one year
ago and about 28 per cent pe-
low the all-time high of two years
ago.

On the other hand, enrollments
in schools below the college level
—mainly trade and vocational
schools—on December 1 reached
an all-time high, approximately 34
per cent above the totals for De-
cember 1, 1948. Institutional on
farm training enrollments were up
23 per cent over a year ago, just
slightly under the record enroll-
ment period of September this year.

The national figures as of No-
vember 1, 1949, indicate an over-all
trend similar to North Carolina’s.
Institutions of higher learning
showed a 17 per cent enrollment
drop this year, while the schools
below college level were enjoying
an all-time high for enrollments,
approximately 23 per cent above
the November 1, 1948 totals.

Enrollments in the on-the-job
training program likewise show a

ROTC Students Cry
During Gas Attack

Monday afternoon while cleaning
their rifle, several ROTC students
were suddenly beset by a tear gas
attack. The gas originated from a
grenade thrown in jest by the sup-
ply sergeant who dashed back into
the armory leaving the boys to
face the gas unmasked. Only one
or two remained in the vicinity of
the armory long enough to see (?)
how it felt, since most of those
present had become familiar with
the effects of tear gas through
gangster movies.The gas was soon
dispersed around the cleaning
tables, but traces of it still clung
to the halls of Georgia for nearly
twenty minutes after the bomb was
detonated.

GIFT FUND $200 SHORT OF
$5,000 GOAL FOR ILOILO

The proposed goal, $5,000, of the
YMCA Christmas Gift Fund Cam-
paign has been reached. by the Da-
vidson student body. The cam-
paign, which had as its purpose
the raising of money to be used in
the equipping of a YMCA Boy’s
Camp at Hoilo in the Philippines,
ended Thursday night, December
15, having been in progress since
Monday, December 12. The daily
progress of the program was shown
on a meter on the stage of Cham-
ber's Auditorium, and the success-
ful result of the drive was an-
nounced Friday by Curtis Harper
during the chapel exercises.

It is estimated that $7,500 will
be required to equip this. Hoilo
camp, which is to be dedicated to
the students of Davidson College.
The YMCA funds for reconstruc-

ition will supplement Davidson’s
Gift Fund.

Since as far back as 1928 David-
son students have promoted spe-
cial charitable funds which have
been used to finance Christian activ-

ities throughout the world. In 1928,
the first year affording a YMCA
record of such a program, the
movement was called the Mission
Fund Drive; for the money raised
was given to a mission project,
which otherwise might not have
been completed. ‘The Christmas
Gift Fund, which is now annually
sponsored by Davidson’s YMCA,
evolved from the Mission Fund
during the early thirties when, in
December, 1930, Davidson’s student

body gave $1000 to Barium Springs |

Orphanage. This gift to Barium
Springs was Davidson's first
Christmas Gift Fund.

From 1930 until today, Davidson,
by way of its Christmas Gift Fund,
has given large sums of moncy,

Popular Classical
Numbers Rendered
By Concert Band

The Davidson concert band, un-
der the direction of James Chris-
tian Pfohl, presented its first for-
'mal concert of the year in Cham-
bers Auditorium on Tuesday night,
December 13.

The band opened its concert with
the inspiring old chorale, “A
Mighty Fortress is Our -God.'’ Fol-
lowing this ‘was the March and
chorus, “See the Conquering hero
comes!'? from Handel's oratorio,
1"Judas Maccabeacus.’’ The music of
the Htalian composer, Rossini, has
long been popular in this coun-
‘try. The band continued its pro-
gram with one of his best known
overtures, “The Htalian in Algiers.”
The folk music of Russia furnished
the band with its next number,
“Four Russian Folk Songs, Opus
58," by Liadov., Following this folk
music suite was a stirring concert
march, “Majesty of America,’ by
David Bennett. Next the band
turned again to the realm of folk
music for “Five American Folk
Songs.” Selection of Jerome Kern
Songs” as arranged by Erik Leid-
zen furnished many of the best
known melodies of one of Ameri-
ca’s favorite composers. The
“March from Second Suite in F" by
Gustav Holst provided a martial
finale to the concert. Sibley Dorton,
student conductor, brought the con-
cert to a close as he directed the
band in “O’ Davidson’' and “All
Hail, O Davidson.”

Mr. Pfohl says that several con-
certs are'planned for the coming
semester in addition to the weeks
concert tour which the band will

make. in the early Spring. These

planned concerts will include pro-
grams here on the campus. Al-
though plans are not yet complete,
Mr..Pfohl says that the concert tour
which has taken the band into
Florida for the past two years will
be made in the other direction this
year.

The band will also be heard at
the traditional vesper program this
Sunday night.

NUMBER TWELVE

ODES SCHOLARSHIP

DAVIDSON, ANNAPOLIS, YALE
PRINCETON STUDENTS NAMED

It was announced in Chapel this past Tuesday morning that
Charles Davis, a member of the senior class from Mississippi,
had been awarded a Rhodes Scholarship. This is the first such
scholarship awarded to n Davidson student in thirteen years.
As the highest academic honor a student can receive, a Rhodes
Scholarship entitles the recipient to
two and possibly three years of
study at Oxford University.

There are a number of qualifica-
ti which one must meet before
applyin,, for a scholarship. They
Jare as follows:

~

1. Be a male, unmarried citizen
of the United States.

2. Be between the ages of ninteen
and twenty-five on October i 1950.

3. Have completed at least your
sophomore year in coll.¢e at the
time of application,

There is a lot more’ to it than
this, though, as Davis can probably
relate, for applicants who are eligi-
bic must then be screened and in-
terviewed, to be chosen on several
other points: Their literary and
scholastic ability and attainments;
their qualities of mantiood, honor,
friendship and. unselfishness; and
their exhibition of moral force of
character and leadership. These
were all provisions spccifically
stated in Cecil Rhodes’ wiil: that
the men chosen for his scholar-
ships might be of the highest possi-
ble type.

Now that Davis has succeeded,
he plans to leave for Oxford’ some-
time ‘next fall, where he is going
to study medieval history (a field:
in which Oxford has no peer). His
scholarship is for a year.

At Davidson he has been quite
active in campus events, being a
member of Sigma Upsilon literary
fraternity, the Philanthropic Lit-
erary Society, the International Re-
lations Club, a columnist for the
Davidsonian, and an_ associate
editor of Scripts 'n Pranks. Last
year Davis won the Vereen Bell
creative writing award, and this
year was elected to Phi Beta Kap-.
pa. He is a member of Sigma Al-.
pha Epsilon social fraternity, and
has also served on the Honorary
Fraternity Council and the Foren-
sic Council.

Professor and Mrs. Watts. Seven-
teen of the. tweny members were
present.

The first portion of the program

Blanche,” a Christmas story, by
Ken W. Jones. Bob Keever de-
livered the Scripture reading: the
birth of Christ, from Luke 2:1-20.
J. J. Murray next read a paper

toms in France, tracing many
French customs connected with
Christmas, from their beginnings:

eral French Christmas carols, The

late eclairs, coca-colas, and dough-
nuts.

Pseudo Sisters Sing
Features Eu Program

Wednesday morning the Eu-
manean Literary Society presented
one of the most entertaining chapel
programs of the geason.

Chuck Kirby, president of the
active organization, directed the
program which was varied with
stump speeches, ballad readings,
and “chorus girls’’ singing. Pete
Kalogridis, of the sophomore class,
in appropriate regalia and mus-
tache, presented delightful high-
lights in Eu Society history. Next,
‘Ken Goodpasture, also dressed as
one straight out of the gay nine-
ties, read an Alaska ballad of Yu-
kon Jake, filled with pearls of hu-
mor, welcomed heartily by all
present.

These two old boys had to take
a short nap, and during their
dreamy reminiscings, .three “love-
lies” bounced into the spotlight.
These freshmen chorus girls put.
the Andrew Sisters to shame with
their melodies. No one could tell
it, because of.the lipstick and rogue,
but these characters off-stage are
better known as Bill Trotman,

Encores ‘were very popular during
the Eu’s program.
