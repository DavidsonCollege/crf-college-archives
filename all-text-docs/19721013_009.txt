team with a 1-0 conference
record and a 3-1 overall tally.

Fogleman was pleased with
the way “we controlled the ball
in the middle of the field.”’

Fogleman noted that Johnny
Robinson, Tornee, and goalies
Charlie Slagle and Paul Cald-
well all played good games.

“We had to make some ad-
justments because this was the
first time we ever played on
Polyturf." Fogleman thought
that the team preferred the new
surface to natural grass after
they adjusted to it.

The first half. though well
played. ended 0-0. Appalachian
came back to score early in the
third quarter to take a 1-0 lead

Tornee scored on a direct kick
in the fourth quarter to tie it up

Fogleman praised the team-

“There were eight seconds left
when we had a free throw-in

Blackwood who chipped it right

There was one second left on the
clock when Roger scored.’

Booters Have Two Goalies

By JIM SITTERSON

Davidson is the only small
college in the nation which is
still playing major college foot-
ball. Not to be outdone. the soc-
cer team has devised an equally
eccentric policy.

Davidson is one of the few, if
any teams to play two goalies in
each game.

Junior Charlie Slagle and
senior Paul Caldwell have
shared the goalie duties in each
game this season, alternating
halves.

This system is somewhat
“unorthodox” as the Duke soc-
cer coach politely put it. The
other reactions from the Duke
team varied between “what?”
and ‘that's wierd.”

“I'm not sure why were
doing it this way, but I guess it
works. Paul has always played
this way before and likes it bet-
ter. So do I," said Slagle.

Caldwell stated that he
thought using two goalies was a
good idea.

“It takes the pressure off you
if you can sit back and watch
part of the game. You get time
to watch the other team and
prepare yourself for what they
might try.” he said.

In using two goalies. Coach
Harry Fogleman gives Slagle
the experience he needs without

putting too much pressure on
him.

At the same time, Caldwell is
able to play more comfortably
in the style he is accustomed to.

Slagle and Caldwell have dit-
ferent styles of playing.

According to Slagle. ‘Paul
plays a lot closer to the line than
I do. I like to come out and cut
down the angle. This makes me
more vunerable to the chip shot.
Paul is more of a team leader in
the goal, he yells a lot. I guess
I'm just a crowd pleaser.”

Caldwell supported Slagle’s
statements saying, ‘I play in a
lot closer and rely on my
reflexes. Charlie is a former
football player, he likes to go
out and kill people. I just get the
ball and try to get the hell out of
there.”

Statistically speaking. Slagle
has had more goals scored upon
him. On the other hand all but
one of Davidson's goals have
been scored while Slagle was in
the goal.

This is no reflection on Cald-
well however. It just seems that
Davidson is a second half team.

So for this season. Caldwell
has played the first half and
Slagle the second.

Fogleman reversed this
method in the Duke game. The
experiment appeared not to be
successful however. as David-

Sailors Blown Away

By JOHN McELVEEN
Staff Writer

The Davidson Sailing Team
suffered defeat at home port
this past weekend in the David-
son Fall Invitational Regatta.

Hoping to end their string of
losses, the members of the
sailing team put in a full week
of ‘intensive’ practice.
Despite this effort the Cats
finished ninth.

“This last place finish is a bit
harder to take.” stated Frank
Somerville, who along with
Mark Leonard and Jim
Stephenson sailed in B division.
‘I must say our hopes were up.
We had a few things on our si
for a change: our boats and our
lake. But we just got blown
away.”

Daryl! Douglas. sailing in A
division, with Doug McElfresh
as his crew. was disqualified
(DSQ‘ed) in two of the first
three races.

“I just cut it too close.”
Douglas explained. “It was a
simple port-starboard
situation.”

“I felt largely responsible for
our poor showing.‘ Douglas con-
tinued, *‘Mark and Frank sailed
well, and without my DSQ's we
could have beaten three or four
other schools.”

The Citadel. with skippers
Tom Harken and Frickie Mar-
tschinck. proved to be too much
of a challenge.

Their first place finish
brought back memories of last
spring's Conference Cham-
pionships held at Lake Norman
in which The Citadel took the
number one spot.

Douglas pointed out that he
knew The Citadel would be
tough. ‘They're tough anyway -
but in heavy air. they're at their
best.”

Furman this Saturday. Both
goalies said they have no
preference as to which half they
play. as long as they play.

Along with heavy air come
fast speed and costly collisions.
Such proved to be the case.

In assessing the damage.
Douglas noted “One boat was
seriously damaged while the
mainsheet blocks were ripped
out of several others.

potential to be Duke's best ever.
They haven't matured yet. but
I'm hoping they will against
Davidson."

Although optimistic, the Blue
Devils actually expected a
much closer game. This at-
titude expressed by the coach
was, “I think we'll win, but I
wouldn't want to bet money on
it.”

Fogleman went into the game
cautiously, saying. “This will
be our toughest game yet. They
have the best team they ve had
in some years.’ The team itself
felt that they would be able to
keep up with Duke

Duke's strong point had to be
their Latin-American con-
tingent whose play and chatter
both amazed and amused the
Davidson crowd

Charhe Siagle started in goal
for the first half. Duke totally
dominated the play and scored
four times.

Davidson was unable to
mount any kind of sustained at-
tack. The closest Davidson
came to scoring was on a fine
effort by Rheinhard Pfeil whose
shot hit the bottom edge of the
crossbar.

Paul Caldwell was in the goal
for the second half. but Duke
still controlled the play and
managed to score twice.

Although disappointed by the
final score. Fogleman was not
overly discouraged.

“We never gave up, and you
certainly can't say that we were
out-hustled.”” he said. Several
starters played with injuries,
including Johnny Robinson and
Tornee.

The team meets Furman in a
conference game on Saturday.

At Home

‘Naturally I'm sad to see the
boats being torn up - especially
after Somerville, Mattox and I
worked during summer break
to get them in good shape; but
with a little money and a lot of
work we'll have them back in
good sailing condition,’ he said.
