Paragraphics....

The Junior class, headed by Russell Patterson,
should receive very hearty felicitations for the
excellent set of dances they sponsored last week-
end. Everything went off in a very harmonious
and rhythmical fashion.

Drs, Barr and Ellwood have showed us why
we should study the Social Seienees, now we
would like to hear a defence for the other de-
partments.

Davidson's Baccalaureate speaker, Dr. Joseph
R. Sizoo, is pictured in the current rhotogravure
section of The New York Times, but their failure
to mention it indicates that they didn't know that
he was to be on our campus in June.

Wade. Boggs, who was runner-up to both of
‘these men, could have filled either job very cap-
ably. We sympathize with him in his defeats, but
offer him consolation in the assurance that there
are a large number of men in the student body
who respect his ability and admire his manly
qualities.

Phi Betas....

Five members of the Senior Class have recently
been elected to membership in Phi Beta Kappa.
which to some may mean simply the privilege to
wear-an attractive key, but fundamentally it is the
reward for application. Just as Gray tells us in
that immortal churchyard elegy of his that “Many

-a flower is born to blush unseen, and waste its
sweetness on the desert air,” so does many a
brilliant minded student pass his college days
without the proper application ‘of his faculties.

That is what Phi Beta Kappa represents. In

plain every day words it means that those men

who have been invited into that organization have
done, in the best possible way, the very thing that
they primarily came to college to do.

For the past monzh there has hung from, the

Peace and Preparedness...

With Europe literally boiling in the frigid
hands of her coid-blooced dietators, reminiscences
of 1914 are recalled to the minds of many who
lived through those trying weeks before the last
creat bloody struggle, and to those of us who
came along soon thereafter, discomfort, suffer-
ing. and invineihle trizls and problems are all
too real,

We see it proclaimed in every newspaper and
hear it trom nearly every platiorm that the
world is on the verge of another colossal interna-
upnal embroglio. Germany, Franee. italy, Russia
and ail the other states of Europe are arming to
the limit. disregarding all peace pacts, startling
the world into another frantic. wasteful affray,
jor what cause. no_one can honestly assert.

Where does the United States stand, with all
her strikes for peace among students on the one
hand and her ROTC units striving to train edu-
cated officers for a reserve to be employed when
neeessary On the other?

Peace is undeniably what the citizens of the
United States practically unanimously desire and
will strive for, but it would be obviously a very
foolhardy stunt for every American to simultan-
eousty say, ‘Il can see no possible cause for the
Tnited States to ever have another war, conse-
quently I will fay down ‘sword and shield’ and

vooe

return to my ‘shovel and hoe’.

The Ekelihood of an attack upon American soil
is extremely doubtful, but it is less likely if we are
prepared to meet any such occurrence that might
arise.

Tt has been contended that the military training
taught ia the ROTC departments of the colleges
throughout the United States tend to mhke the
students wat minded, That it is encouraging the
youth of America to invite conflict with other
nations of the world.

No more fallacious contention has ever been
resounded. ¥f any one of the advocates of- that
belief could go through four years of instruction
and disciptine as is offered by any college military
department in America I am confident he would
come to the end of it feeling that peace should
be sought to the last degree, but that as great
and powerful a nation as the United States needs
‘to maintain adequate national defence if freedom
and democracy are to be guarded.

The United States has very vital connections
with almost every country of the world. If an-
other world wide crisis should precipitate, it
would take more influential. diplomacy and wiser
statesmanship than has ever been displayed be-
fore to keep the United States from taking part.

So, with enthusiastic emotion, fet us rally to the
promption of world peace, but let us not con-
scientiously object to the proper amount of prepa-
ration against that day when trouble might de-
scend upon America, nor be opposed to support-
ing her, if and when she becomes involved.
eS
average for membership in this oldest of college
fraternities, it is only a regretful reminder that
talents have been dissipated and time wasted,
but to underclassmen it can yet be a goal, and
an inspiring one toward ‘which enterptising
students aspire and often attain.

the Pharisees and Sadducees, “pray-

The state of Tennessee drains
one's pocketbook by placing toll
bridges between every important
city, and gas costs over 24c per.
However, one realizes the diffi-
culty of the state government when
one realizes the origin of that great
state. Tennesse was born when a
group of North Carolina citizens re-
fused tg pay their taxes and moved
over where they didn’t have to.
Ever since then, when one has no
connections he is known to have
Sevier-ed connections.

rambling exaggerated cow path
upon which someone has ridden and
dribbled bits of tar, known as the
Andrew Jackson Highway. Old

Carolina and a favorite of mine, I
hated to see him damned with such
faint praise, but I guess it was be-

Sewannee and Chattanooga

On the top of a mountain, where
the air is cool, where!the sun sets
in a warm bright calmness and
where most of the buildings are of
Kray stone and mountain rock, is
the University of the South, a small
school of about 300, under Episco-
palian influence. Professor String-
fellow Barr's observation that there
is somethitig exciting about a group
of College Men gathered together
and devoted to learning struck a
note that resounded hard when’ we
felt Sewannee. The Student Body
is a group of congenial Southern
gentlemen and the hospitality. is
fine. Two things particularly im-
pressed us about this Episcopalian
school: Coats are worn invariably,
and it is known for having the best
college dances in the South. Seniors
and Juniors wear gowns and what
Davidson calls Student Councilmen
are “proctors’’ at Sewannee.

Chattanooga is a thriving indus-
trial city in the valley between two
hills which seems smoky in the day
time but at night, driving down
from Lookout Mountain, the atmos-
phere is frothy in. a myriad of
twinkling lights. Everything in
Chattanooga is named “House.”
There is the Read House. the Ross
House, some varieties of “Steak
House,” and some wag utilized the
situation by calling his hamburger
shop “Powerhouse.”

Knoxville and Kentucky

Knoxville is our favorite of Ten-
hessee cities. At the Andrew John-
son, Ernie Dooley’s folks (Ernie,
you know, loves the Vogler Boat
Song) treated us like princes.

Kentucky:—Tennessee has bad
toads and poor marking but is at
least consistent. In the Blue Grass
State one rides well and then all
of a sudden hits a washout in the
toad, if not a washout a cow. The
effect is somewhat that of riding in
a train and making a bridge cross-
ing every hundred yards. Kentucky
does mark her roads however -and
is a good state,
scen no blue grass, no horses
women and no mountaineers.

Washington. — With the re-in-
statement of their president, Edna
Richter, the WPA union won a long
hard fiight to prove that union dis-
crimination had been practiced by
WPA offcials. This victory for the
young college-trained unionists is
supposed to mean that henceforth
ithe union will be given a free hand
here in promoting the cause of em-
ployees of the WPA administra-
tive staff. It should also mean
rapid growth for this local and in-
creased prestige for it in AFGE
councils, Only one other lodge, the
NRA lodge, has demonstrated its
ability to protect a union member
released because of union activity.

AFGE President Babcock, realiz-
ing the strength of the Richter case
as a union issue, offered to make a
special trip to see Harry Hopkins,
then in Florida,‘and induce hinr to
reinstate Miss Richter. But the
WPA unionists prefer to have
fought the fight successfully them-
selves since it brought the desired
admission that Miss Richter had
been discriminated against, rather
than to have had her hired again
without that admission, as an ac-
complishment of Babcock instead
of as a union victory...

oF

With more and more government
agencies, cutting down the size of
their staffs the job situation is be-
coming acute here. Officials of any
importance whatever are constant-
ly badgered and beleaguered by ex-
employees of AAA, WPA and NRA
for new positions. Local govern-
ment unions are trying to induce
the. WPA to start a federal project
here. to care for the newly unem-~
ployed_.. With the passage of the
new farm bill former AAA em-
ployees are expecting that those
given brief furloughs without pay
will have those furloughs extended
for two months, or until such time
as the new farm bill setup provides
new jobs. Those with furloughs,
,of course, get first crack at any
'new jobs appearing .. .

What the President meant by
“windfall taxation” was taxation of
the returns made to processors.of
AAA taxes impoynded by court ac-
tion, not a tax laid on the general,
public. In spite of the fact that his
meaning was clear, political car-
toonists the country over drew pic-
tures of Wallace and Tugwell seek-
ing the taxpayer with “just an-
other tax, with a new name,” while
the papers they drew for were
pointing out that it was a special
tax on a spécial group, a group ad-
mittedly unpopular for getting taxes
returned that they had passed on
to the consumer. All of which
brings up the old question, “Do po-
litical cartoonists read the newspap-

NYA projects, providing employ-
ment for thousands of youths out of
school and out of work, are being
routed through WPA project pro-
cessing very rapidly. The WPA’s
Coordinating Committee - alone,
which handles only statistical pro-
jects, has 500 such projects before
it for consideration, as one part of
the $20,000,000 job program of the
NYA. Even if only a small per-
centage of these passed it. would
mean the greatest upturn in the

You're ignorant of the realities of
lift if you're of college age. thinks
Dr. William) Carpenter MacCarty
of the graduate school of the Uni-
versity of Minnesota. .

The doctor parcels out your life
like this:

1—Pre-birth—age of ancestral de-
fects.

2--Birth to 16 years—age of su-
preme ignorance, affection and con-
fidence.

3—Sixtcen to 25—age of energy,
optimism, imagination. adventure,
discovery. invention and ignorance
of the realities of life.

4—Twenty-five to 55—age of ego-
tism, self-confidence, selfishness,
over cxpansion and frequent mis-
takes.

5—Fifty-five to death—age of ex-
perience, wisdom, tolerance, con-
servatism and simplicity.

y* *. *

In addition to being ignorant of
the realities of life, you (if you're
a co-ed) are probably also badly
spoiled. -

Or at least so thinks another doc-
tor, Prof. Charles Reed_of North-
western University, who thinks the
human race is degenerating, that
all us young ‘uns are getting soft.

“The daughters,” he says, “are
pampered and petted. They don’t
get enough sunshine or exercise.
They can't take it the way their
grandmothers did:”’
