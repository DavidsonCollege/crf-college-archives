The SPE’s intend to have their

The first Draft Deferment Ex-
amination of the 1954-55 school
year will be given Thursday, De-
cember 9, Dr. W. O. Puckett an-
nounced today.

All applications for the first
test must be turned in at the
Registrar’s office before Novem-
ber 23. Applications may be ob-
tained from any Selective Service
board.

A passing grade on this test
exempts a student from call into
the armed forces during his un-
dergraduate career. Dr. Puckett
urges that all upper-classmen who
are registered and have not pre-
viously taken the test to take the
December 9 exam. He urges fresh-
man registrants to take the April
exam.

The Draft Deferment Examina-
tion may be taken only once by a
student. A failing grade has no ef-
fect on the recipient's Selective
Service classification.

To be eligible to apply for the
Selective Service tests a student
must: (1) intend to request defer-
ment as a student; (2) be satisfac-
torily pursuing a full-time course
of instruction; and (3) must not
previously have taken the qualifi-
cation test.

Students whose academic year
will end in January 1955 are urged
to take the December test so they
will have a test score on file at
their local boards before the end
of their academic year, at which
time their boards will reopen and

whether they should again be de-
ferred as students.

The present criteria for defer-
ment as an undergraduate student
are either a score of 70 on the
qualification test or specified rank
among the male members of the
class (upper half of freshman class,
upper two-thirds of sophomore
class, or upper three-fourths of
junior class). In addition to meet-
ing one of these two requirements,
the student must, at the end of
each academic year, progress to the
next higher class.

Students accepted for admission
to or in attendance at a graduate
school after July 1, 1951, satisfy
the criteria if they ranked among
the upper one-half of the male
members of their senior class or
made a score of 75 or better on
the test. Graduate students admit-
ted after January 1, 1955, must
have ranked among the upper one-
fourth of the male members of
their senior class or made a score
of 80 or better on the qualification
test.

Major General Lewis B. Hershey,
Director of Selective Service, has
emphasized many times that local
boards are not required to defer
students meeting the criteria.
Meeting the criteria merely makes
a student eligible to be considered
for a student deferment. If a local
board refuses to defer a student
meeting the criteria, he of course
has the right to appeal his case,

consider their cases to determine! Hershey pointed out.

Student Sleeps Self To College Success

(ACP)—It’s possible to sleep
your way through college, says the
Varsity News of the University of
Detroit.

A. W. Turnbow, a 1054 Nebras-
ka college graduate, boasts that
he “slept his way through.” This
admission stunned professors who
once predicted Turnbow’'s college
career would end in failure.

His secret? He had been “sleep-

CAST OF FIRST PLAY| By-Pass Of Town

Casting for the first Red and
Black Masquers play of 195455
was completed this week. The title
of the play to be presented in
Chambers Auditorium December 9
and 10 is The Bishop Misbehaves.

Senior Fred Summers will take
the role of the misbehaving bi-
shop. He will be supported by Al-
lie Cone as Red Eagen, and Har-
old Hall as Donald Meadows. Oth-
er members of the cast and the
characters they will portray are
Sandy McGeachy as Waller, Tom
Morgan as Collins, Ed Hadley as
“Frenchie,” and Mac Williamson
as Brooke. Women in the cast are
Mrs, Howard Lamar as Mrs. Wal-
ler, Mrs. Stein Wilson as Lady
Lyons, and Mrs. Sam Magill as
Hester.

Professor Tyson is directing the
play. Bob Rhodes heads the stage
crew, and Albert Harris and Tom
Morgan are in charge of props.

The Red and Black Masquers’
president, Fred Summers, said
that the group greatly appreciated
the interest shown in the tryouts
this week, and he urged those who
were not selected for the cast this
time to continue their interest in
working with dramatics. He also
asked for anyone interested in
working with the stage crew to
see either Bob Rhodes or him.

The group plans one major per-
formance each semester and has

arranged a tour this spring. The |

Red and Black Masquers has pro-
duced plays annually here at Da-
vidson since its formation in 1920.

dence school with more than 150,-

sticks to it,” he said.

Turnbow first read 2,000 Russian
vocabulary words into a machine,
then gave the English meaning to
each. “Results were so successful
that I started reading notes from
all my courses into the device.”

“I remember how my fellow stu-
dents laughed when I told them
about ‘sleep-learning’,” he said.
“But when I started tossing around
five-syllable words, formulas, dates
and complete passages from Shake-
oo they changed their atti-
tude.”

Rapid progress is being made by
the State Highway Department on
U. S. Route 21’s new through-
highway from Charlotte to States-
ville, a route which will by-pass
the towns of Davidson, Hunters-
ville, Cornelius, and Mooresville,
thus alleviating to a great extent
the severe traffic problem which
has existed along the present route
for sveral years, ~

Reports indicate that it will be
over a year before the new road
will be ready for extensive use,
although the major road grading
and bridge construction projects
in the area of Davidson and Cor-
nelius have been completed.

*The new by-pass will affect both

the college and the town of David-
son considerably in that it will
remove a large amount of the
heavy fast-moving traffic which is
characteristic of the present Char-
lotte-Statesville highway. On the
other hand, the town will become
even more “isolated” than it is
now, although the by-pass will ex-
tend to within a mile of David-
son’s city limits and will be no
more than five minutes’ driving
distance from the college.

and their first over Davidson.
The-probable starting lineups
are as follows:

out on top by the unbelievable RE—Sexton

score of 81-6. In this series, ex-

tending over fifty years, the Cats!y 11 crevens

have been victorious in fifteen} pi sasie

games, while the Terriers have FB—Gobolos

been unable to win a single con-
test. One game ended in a 7-7 tie.
The biggest score was Davidson's
870 victory in 1621.

On Monday the Wildcats began
preparation for the game without
Coach Dole on the scene due to an
attack of influenza.

The Cats are expected to be at
full strength for the game Satur-
day with the possible exceptions of
ends Tom Newton and Charlie
Rankin. Newton suffered a char-
ley-horse in the first half of last
week's game and may be hamper-
ed by it Saturday. Rankin sustain-
ed a cut on his forehead which re-
quired eight stitches to close.

Coach Dole feels that Wofford
will be the sécond-best team we
have faced this year. Coach Big-
gers of Catawba said after last
weeks game, “I would say David
son has the best team we played
all year—with the exception of
Wofford.” So the general feeling
is that the Cats are in for a long,
hard night of football.

Davidson started slow last week
and played listless ball during the
first half, and we will have to go
from start. to finish to beat the
Terriers who are thirsty for vic-
tory number eight of the season
