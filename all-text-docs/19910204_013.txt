The Two Gentlemen of Verona:
“Spaghetti Western Meetings Ringling Brothers"

By David Thompson

On Thursday, January 24, The
Acting Company presented their
“Spaghetti Western meets the
Ringling Brothers” version of The
Two Gentlemen of Verona.

In the hands of The Acting
Company, Two Gentlemen, one of
Shakespeare’s earlier and less re-
spected comedies, becomes a
wonderful farce which lampoons
notonly the flighty nature of youth-
ful infatuation butalso several con-
ventions of the singing cowboy
film genre.

Charles Newell’s imaginative
and charged direction lends Two
Gentlemen a contemporary feel
which makes the play pertinent
and fun not only for students of
Shakespeare, but for anyone who
enjoys the theater or just likes a
good laugh. From the very
opening moments, we see that The
Acting Company does not offer a
conventional rendition. Protago-
nists Valentine and Proteus (played
by Laurence Drozd and William
D. Michie, respectively) discuss
their feelings about love in what

"it was the longest light I had ever

been on.

Upon arriving at NOLS in
Lander, I found that 15 other people
- four women and 11 men ~ were
just as scared as myself. We all
looked around at our first meeting

, as a whole group that night, and

made the dreadful realization that
we were about to spend the next
three months together.

Two days later we embarked
on our first of five sections, begin-
ning with twenty-five days of
backpacking in the Wind River
Wilderness Range in central west-
erm Wyoming.

The second and third sections
were spent rockclimbing: in the
Black Hills of South Dakotaand in
Devil’s Tower, Wyoming.

Caving, the fourth section was
quite an experience in itself. It’s a
lot like going underground and
running around in a playground

‘for six to eight hours. We caved at

Wind Cave and Jewel Cave, both
limestone formation caves on the
perimeter of the Black Hills. This
isreally one of the most interesting
sections of the NOLS semester,

even if it’s not the most fun for .

some.
Personally, Ireally sieve it be-

inspires her. “My husband im-

skills haveand buildon them. He

subject of her poetry. Family is

the qualities of love, caring,

seems to be an urban health club.

From this odd start the scene
changes continuously - from a
1950s style beauty salon to a sa-
loon of the wild west to the bath-
room of the. Duke of Milan (pre-
sented here as the Marshall of
“Millen”). The ingenious staging
and blocking by Newell and move-
ment director Jim Calder make
these shifts both plausible and hi-
larious with only minor alterations
to the actual set.

Costume Director Catherine
Zuber, outfits the supporting play-
ers in circus clown suits, while the
lead actors are dressed as if an
epidemic of Saturday Night Fever
were rampant at the OK Corral:
Correctly banished from this pro-
duction are any of the oft consid-
ered “traditionally Shakespearean”
costumes suchas leotards and cod-
pieces.

The comedic timeliness of the
costumes helps to dissipate any
apprehensions the audience might
have about Shakespeare’s humor
being anachronistic.

cause caving is just about the only
sport where one explores places
where no person has ever gone
before. Both caves we went into
have over fifty miles of explored

passageways, and on the average, |
three to four miles of new passage- '

generally by the National Park
Service, but also by NOLS stu-

dents and instructors every so of- |
ten. But, after twelve days, we |

returned once again to Lander.

- Eighteen days of backpacking

the next highlight of the course: A
“loving” family of cyotes that
trailed our group through the whole
section. They would howl us to
sleep every night which added to
the mystery that’s anweniee in any
desert trip.

The November days, normally
cold and rainy for me at Davidson,
were marked by beautiful seventy-
degree weather and sunshine fol-
lowed by bitterly cold nights typ-

We spent our Thanksgiving
walking fourteen milés in search

though I was in good shape by this _

point, I hated the entire day be-
cause fourteen miles in one day is
a very long day.

my time at NOLS was justified. I

Company are of the highest cali-
ber. These people are funny in and
of themselves: their smiles, their
gestures, and their incredible ani-
mation perfectly suit this sort of

farce. One cannot doubt for even

. the slightest fraction of a second

that the actors are having an abso-
lute blast with their roles.

Rainn Wilson, as Speed, comes
across as especially euphoric. In

ing bag, and thought of how all of -

my family and friends were proba-
bly passing out after gorging them-
selves at Thanksgiving dinner, and
here I was, passing out from ex-
haustion after my Thanksgiving

dinner of instant mashed potatoes

and hot cocoa.

Ithinkit was the first time I had
ever earnestly given thanks for
anything--the fact that I was alive

\ and enjoying the beauty of all that

was around me.

Our final section, winter camp-
ing and cross country skiing, was
nothing but sheer hell for this

' Southern boy not used to feet upon

feet of snow.

Twelve days spent in the Ab-
-soaraka Mountain Range sleeping
in grinzhees, snow shelters, in
below zero weather--so cold I
wanted to cry every morning when
Thad to getout of my sleeping bag.

I guess that the overall state-
ment of this article is that if you
want to do something that will be
one of the greatest experiences in
your life, try NOLS. Talk to me or
‘my friend, Andrew Peercy, if you
‘want to find out more, because he
just did a NOLS semester in the
Southwest.

Well, if you’ve now made ‘it
through this whole article in one
sitting, thank you for letting me
ramble off my fond memories of
my semester. Later!

The Flute sounds loud,
But yet so gracefully.
With a good melody.
“Songs of cheer,”
Thus says the Flute
“cry out with joy.”
Continue to go
far and near. Love it sends to one
and all
Surrounding the heart thatenters
the melody.

Peace.

How sweet the sound

their production of Romeo and Ju-
liet, these same players seem forced
to grind out expressions of over-
whelming grief and sadness; but in
Two Gentlemen, the entire com-
pany is in truly fine form.
Particularly worthy of note for
their outstanding comedic presence
are Diana LaMar, Laurence Drozd,
and William D. Michie. LaMar’s
Julia in Two Gentlemen is an angst
ridden riot. LaMar convinces us of
Julia’s pain while brilliantly pull-
ing off a series of well constructed
gags.
. Laurence Drozd, as Valentine,
alsocontributesa performance well

His exaggerated mime while hold-
ing the reigns of an unseen, unruly
horse works well both as physical
humor and as an attack ‘on the
silliness of exaggerated mime it-
self. While professing his love for
the forbidden Silvia in song,
Drozd’s- Valentine becomes the
cheesiest of, Ramada Inn-esque
lounge singers, complete. with the
neon smile, and is a delight to
watch..

stocked with high-spirited camp. ,

The finest performance, how-
ever, is delivered by Mr. Michie.
In both Two.Gentlemenas Proteus
andRomeo and Juliet as Mercutio,
Michie brings to his roles an an-
tagonistic intensity which nearly
frightens as it entertains. His dec-
laration of his love for Silvia, and
his willingness to betray his best
friend, Valentine, is blurted out in
aripple soaked frenzy, and is dread-
fully reminiscent of similar state-
ments made late at night in the
parking lot of The Korner Pub.
Michie’s presentation imparts to
the audience the violent immatur-
ity of Proteus’ infatuation.

The most interesting aspect of
this production, however, is New-
ell’s handling of the controversial
final scene, in, which Valentine
expresses his forgiveness-of Pro-
teus by awarding him Silvia, the
near victim of the fickle villain’s
attempted rape. By carefully ma-
nipulating his Drozd’s inflection,
Newellclarifies mostofthe scene’s
ambiguity, and makes the cheerful
resolution comical. and, more
importantly, credible.
