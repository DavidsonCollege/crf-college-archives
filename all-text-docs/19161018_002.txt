THE GYMNASIUM PLAN,

When Dr. Martin appears next week
before the executive committee of the
Board of Trustees, he will propose two
plans for the new gymnasium: one will
be of a large building, able to accommo-
date a student body of five hundred, but
lacking for the present a swimming pool ;
the other plan a smaller building, only
little larger than the present gymnasium,
which is cramped in every way, but hav-
ing a small swimming pool. At this
meeting Dr. Martin will also tell which
plan is favored by the students.

The thoughtless student will prob-
ably vote for the latter plan in order to
enjoy the use of the swimming pool. But
those who think will see that in a few
years the Student body will outgrow the
smaller building as the present one has
heen outgrown, that students in the near
future will be as crowded and uncquipt
as we are now.

So we believe that in the voting Fri-
day, altruistic, unselfish, far-sighted men,
who have the best interests of the col-
lege at heart, will cast their's in favor of
the large building will the swimming
pool to follow later.

KEEP THE CAMPUS CLEAN.

Now that the leaves are beginning to
fall, and the grass to turn brown, and
the campus begins to look bare, any un-
sightly object can be seen clearly from a
distance, and it is easy to make the
“beautiful. Davidson campus” appear
anvthing but beautiful. An envelope
carelessly dropped, an empty cigarette
bow thoughtlessly thrown away, each
make ugly spots that the rest of the
Student Body has to look at until
“Uncle Hiram” and his prodding stick
can make their feeble rounds. The
campus is for our use, so why not keep
it clean. Besides, the mere sight of our
Librarian stooping to nick some piece of
paper from the ground should be incen-
tive enough to make waste-baskets of our
pockets till we reach our rooms.

The Social Center is anything else
just at present.
