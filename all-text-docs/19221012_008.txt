“Prices you car afford to pay”

Gentlemen: é
It has started to rain —- looks
like it doesn't intend to stop anytime
soon. Rain means muddy walks and muddy
walks mean wet shoes. The result, wet
feet and a real old-fashioned cold.

Prepare yourself: We have just:
received a complete line of rubbers -
the old reliable "Ball" brand =- in
light and heavy weights. Take my advice
and buy a heavy weight; the first cost
is slightly higher but it will wear
twice as long. -

And while we are on the sub-_
ject I might say that cur raincoats are
very moderately priced.

Sincerely yours,
Mr. Fidler,

surprising relief.

The perfect record: that Georgia

was spoiled last Saturday when Buck

and George King carried the ball
across the goal line that has not been
crossed this season. Although David-
son suffered defeat, it was not the
team’s fault, for they put up a fight
that made the 1916 Southern cham-
pions open theirteves and begin to en-
tertain a doubt of.their victory.
