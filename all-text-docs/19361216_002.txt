Part Three of the amendment which states

that the governing body for the Freshman

Phe name is incidental, having been chosen at

if you name it Queens-Chicora Humane Rela-
tions Society. Rules and regulations in effect
now will continue to operate.

Another point of dispute is that a David-
son tradition (Court of Control) is being an-
nihilated. We would bé the last to advocate
annihilating any of our prized traditions, but
as you perhaps know, the Court of Control
was installed only a few years ago, thus elimi-
nating it from the category of a tradition.

A final decision will be rendered Friday on
this amendment, which appears to be a decided
improvement over the present. system, as it
tends to unify the Student Body.

ASIDES... As the Alumni Journal comes out,
the Graham Plan goes out. But the Alumni
Journal is a whooping success, with pictures
of the proposed building for Davidson in three
colors, alumni notes, football chatter, and his-
tory of successful Davidson graduates.

Dr. Frank Graham, supposed author of the
Graham Plan, has faced much undue criticism
for a Utopian set-up for football, which he did
not compose but heartily favored. His only
mistake was that he allowed his name to be
tacked to it. Many of the authors withdrew
from the field when the going was hot, and
Dr. Graham could have followed suit, except
for the fact that he had too much courage.

THE DAVIDSONIAN WISHES THE STU-

Tolerance...

What is the mark of a truly educated man?
Such an one must have kept his intellectual
integrity, of course, but above all he must
have genuine respect and consideration for
the opinions of others.

Just as someone has defined freedom of
speech as “not the right to say anything you
please, but the right to assume responsibility
for what you have said,” so We may regard
TOLERANCE not as the right to agree with
all comers, but the privilege of disagreeing
amicably with those whose ideas fail to coin-
cide with our own.

If education does not bring home to us this
fact that there are other points of view, that
these may be rational, even right, it has failed
in its purpose. A so-called “liberal arts” col-
lege like Davidson can justify its existence
only so long as its students are taught to
think, to compare and evaluate critically the
conflicting opinions of an unsettled world,

It is so easy to get into an intellectual rut,
to accept literally the words of the text or the
biased pronouncements of a brilliant teacher,
that we sometimes lose sight of the “raison
d'etre” and sell our intellectual birthright for
a mess of didactic potage.

Only the weak fear criticism. The strong

are invariably helped by it. The government
which refuses to allow itself to be criticized,
by that very action, not only admits the criti-
cism is valid, but proves its inability to cope

Have you-ever stopped to think what makes
The Davidsonian possible, how it is financed?
As with-practically every other college publi-
cation, it is OUR ADVERTISERS who are re-
sponsible for the- continued publication of the
paper. They are interested enough in David-
son College to support its publications; we
should be interested enough in them to give
their products and commodities first choice
when we do our buying.

The day of complimentary advertising is
past. The advertiser today wants concrete
results from his ads, and who can blame him?
li he gets results, he will continue to adver-
if not he will drop out. It is up to us
if we do, it will re-

So read the ads! And give OUR ADVER-
TISERS the opportunity to serve you! For

which not exist four years ago; their

But at the same time
they are hampered by an unfair and useless
ruling which prevents members from drop-
ping out, no matter how strong their reasons
may be. A member of the Band, for example,
is required to attend all its practices and func-
tions for the Whole year, even though he finds
after the first two weeks that he hasn’t the
time for‘it (in which case he is asked to drop
one of his subjects or be campused) or that
he simply isn’t interested. (in which case he
can sit all year at every practice and refuse
to play a note); but whatever he does, he
cannot quit. .

Of course, a stable attendance is absolutely
essential to any kind of efficiency and pro-
gress. But I believe that a musical organiza-
tion should maintain a stable attendance on its
own merit, without, feeling compelled to swell
its ranks with men who honestly want to get
out of it. At any rate, it must be remembered
(1) that music is an extra-curricular activity,
designed purely for the profit of the student
who enjoys it, and (2) that because it is an
extra-curricular activity, it is unjust to force
it on anyone who is not remunerated for it.

Most of us agree that this ruling, in its pres-
ent air-tight form, ignores these two points
and should therefore be materially changed
before it completely defeats its own purpose.

OPEN FORUM

To The Editor:

The question of participants in
student activities who do not re-
ceive the proper recognition has
been a popular question during the
last few years and efforts have been
made successfully to honor these
martyrs of athletics.

We give cups to the blocking
back | who paves the way for the
fullback. We have honored the un-
sung heroes in the other school of
sports yet there is a group of men
in every school sport that are not
recognized. This group are the
undergraduate managers.

Our senior managers are proper-
ly rewarded for their four years of
work but the managers who have
worked hard for one or two years
should receive some sort of recog-
nition. I am not saying give all the
freshman managers the class num-
eral but let the ones who are chosen
for sophomore manager be given
some reward for their work.—F. P.

Dear Editor:

One of the most important things

things I think the development of
constructive thinking has been neg-
lected, or at least severely ham-
pered.

phasis on activities as such, on ath-

Finally, there is far too much re-
to efforts of.the faculty
to make the students think. It is
almost pathetic to observe the many
methods by which professors strive
to get independent thinking from
the students. When a professor in-
serts a thought question among his
factual questions, there is a gasp
of helplessness from the class.
When it does not come or a review

in the class are likely to find them-
selves deluged by questions from

What\should be done to make
students think ? It’s a hopeless task
unless the student wants to think,
in which case there is no problem.

There is a conspicuous absence
of the usual Georgia-Watts rivalry
this year. No water fights, no pep
meetings, no bands, and the 1936
crop of chapel announcements has
been way below the average of the
two previous years. The water-
fight has been well done away
with, in view of the circumstances,
but it would have given this column
something to talk about for a few
lines. The game promises to be a
more interesting, if less talked up,
affair though. They'll have hel-
