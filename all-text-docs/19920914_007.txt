The Purpose of The Davidsonian

First and foremost the purpose of this newspaper is to serve as an
informational source and forum for the student body of Davidson College
and the community atlarge. The Davidsonian is open to everyone within
the Davidson College Community, especially the student body, but
including faculty and staff. Yourideas, comments, opinions andi pnt are
desired, appreciated and depended upon.

The production of this paper is no lightweight task. The editors and

editorial board spend in excess of 100 hours a week working on the

‘publication of the paper. Within these 100 hours includes the develop-
ment of story ideas, the writing of stories, the layout of the paper, cutting
and pasting and the delivering of it to your doorstep every Monday
evening...

Within this Hea rie WORE the eihiiors and staff members sacrifice their :

free time that could or should be spent studying or enjoying college. Yet,
they willingly and weekly sacrifice their time and sweat towards the
production of this paper. For the 50or soregular contributors to the paper,
the editorial board reiterates its deepest thanks. Without you, it would
certainly be a lost cause.

Four years ago, production of The Davidsonian could have been
described as sporadic at best. Within the stay of the class of 1993, the
paper has become a consistent, steady publication. The editors and staff
continuously strive to stay on top of the issues that we feel and hear are
of interest to you. But we cannot do it without your ae and support.

Ultimately, it is your publication. If you see things about the paper
you don’t like or that are lacking or can be improved (we realize that there
are many) it is your responsibility to tell us. We are not omnipotent. We
cannot do everything. We certainly do not claim to be professional
journalists. All we are are a group of Davidson students who have been
willing to sacrifice significant portions of our lives to ensure that this
community has a weekly informational outlet and forum.

Wearen’tperfect. Werealize that this isn’t the New York Times or The
Washington Post. Itis simply-a college newspaper. We don’t want your
sympathy or pity for our efforts. . . just your help.

Student Defends Davidsonian

To the Editor,

Although I have only
attended Davidson for three
weeks, I strongly agree with
Associate Professor of His-
tory Sally McMillen’s state-
ment, “many Davidsaon stu-
dents exhibit deep concern
about the larger world be-
yond this instiution.” How-
ever, my understanding of
The Davidsonian'’ s purpose
as a newspaper is that it
should report issues directly
affecting Davidson students,
as well as the opinions stu-
dents hold on these issues.

If The Davidsonian
were to give student opin-
ions on global i issues prior-
ity Over opinions on sub-
jects which affect more stu-
dents more directly, the
Davidsonian would become

a‘‘pseudo” Washington Post
Weekly. Assuming our
newspaper did become more
globally oriented, we, as
Davidson students, might be
left withouta forum to voice
Our Opinions on matters di-
rectly affecting our campus.

I understand Dr.
McMillen’sconcem that the
Davidsonian editorial board
might be ignoring serious
“outside” issues which might
ormightnotdirectly affecta
few students on campus.
However, I'honestly believe
that last week, despite
Hurrican Andrew’s wrath,
thé majority of students on
the Davidson campus were
more concerned about the
new alcohol policy.

A good journalist or
editor would write about the

issue which interests or af-
fects the majority of the
publication’s readers, rather
than the issue which most
affects the society asa whole.
Of course, it would be ter-
rifically interesting toread a
letter to the editor from a
student whose family and
lifestyle is being torn apart
in Yugoslavia, buthow many
students would this affect?
It makes a good, informa-
live story, but is not a press-
ing issue affecting the
Davidson campus.

I do not want to be
misinterpricd as cuyfturally
insensitive, but! do feel that
campus issucs, from alcohol
policics to graduation re-
quirements, should be given

Davidson Resident
Disturbed By College Policy

e

To the Editor,

We on North Main
Street are again the victims
of achanging college policy
which does nothing to cor-
rect the behavior of students
who live in town. For many
years we have suffered with
the misbehavior of the SPE’s
at 619 N. Main after the col-
lege voted against allowing
fraternities to be selective in
their membership. We fi-
nally overcame that illegal
action of the fraternity being
inaresidential neighborhood
by hiring a lawyer and hav-
ing a hearing with the Town
Council. The lashes was
evicted.

Now we are being sub-
jected to noise and animalis-
tic behavior by a group of
students who live (and visit)

in the old Johnston House
(on the west side of the street,
wooden, between two brick
houses, one story). We have
called the police who come
and the party quiets down
momentarily. When they
leave, the noise comes back.
Theseso-called students yell
obscentities, urinate off the
back deck in broad daylight
and in the yards of neigh-
bors at night. They have to
be violating the colleges new
alcohol code as well as the
town ordinances against fra-
temities inresidential neigh-
borhoods and no more than
three unrelated people can
live in a house. I have-been
told they belong toa college
fraternity that is supposed to
beoncampus. They seem to
beusing the house fora party

housc outside the restrictions
of the new policy.

Why can’t the college
and/or town do something?
They should not be impotent
about a public nuisance,
which is what these students
have become.

We have appealedto the
landlord, Wilson Sadler, and
he has no been no help.

Why should we suffer?
Somebody must be respon-
sible. « These students
couldn’t act this way with-
out some chemical help —
alcoholor whatever. Surely, -
their parents don’tknow how
they are despoiling our
neighborhood. Immediate
action must be taken.
Sincerely,

Mary F. Stough
N. Main Resident

Krenzer Retorts Criticism

|| To the Editor,

“Scam: stain, spot,
scorch, a hurt, shame.”
Given Mr. Webster’s defi-
nition, I am not really sure
what Mr. Frampton alluded
to in his article. Maybe Mr.
Frampton meant to the use

word “sham” which means
“to deccive or delude with
false pretense; to trick, cheat;
to pass off by fraud or impo-
sition.” In either case one
could not fault me for taking
his characterization person-
ally, —

First of all, the process
of charging a team entry fee
was in place at Davidson
long before I came to work
here or even realized that
Davidson had an intramural
