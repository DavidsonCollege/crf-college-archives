Newspaper Founded
Forty-One Years Ago

Forty-one years ago today—
April 1, 1914—the students
of Davidson College met and
decided to publish their own
official newspaper. Dr. * Frank
W. Price, past-moderator of the
General Assembly of the Presby-
terian Church, U. S., was the first
editor. The aims of the paper and
its purpose in being founded were
to keep in close touch with every
phase of college life, represent stu-

dent opinion fairly end truly,
and to bring into notice all things
pertaining to tne students in any
way. The goal of the paper
was to lead and mould, not to be
led and moulded. For a while the
paper carried some town news. The
paper also had an alumni section.
Another object of the paper was
to keep the alumni in touch with
their old alma mater, so they sent
the paper to all alumni.

Since its beginning in 1914,
the Davdsonien has been pub-
lished continuously. It carried on
full fledge even during the war.
The paper ‘was printed one sum-

mer,

summer publications since. Until

the fall of 1947, the paper was|:

printed by the Standard Printing

Company in Charlotte. The David-|of that. ever faithful Davidsonien

son Printing Company has had the
job ever since. At one time the
size of the paper reached eight
pages; but due to too much adver-
tising and non-interesting material
it was cut to the present size. The
paper carried “For a Better David-
son” as its motto until 1950. Now
the motto usually changes with
the editor. The paper was started
to carry on the Davidson tradition
and spirit; and continues to be a

Runoff; Perkinson Wins

By BILL STEWART, Elections Editor

In balloting after chapel today, Perrin Anderson and
Jason McManus became the two finalists in the bid for
President of the Student Body for the school year-1955-56.

Voting was held after the four finalists had made elec-
tion speeches in which each stated his platform for the
coming year if elected. Anderson, a Sigma Chi from
Union, S.C., placed himself in favor of less secrecy about
Student Council action, continued subsidization of the ath-
letic program, a more effective governing organization,
and pledged himself to uphold the principles embodied in
the constitution.

McManus, a Phi Delt from University City, Mo., whose
speech was cut short by lack of time, warned that as the
Student Council now stands, it is little more than an honor
court. In general, he pledged himself in favor of a Student
Government more active in affairs directly pertaining to
the student. He also favored direct communication channels
between the students and the Board of Trustees.

In the race for Vice-President, Bunny Perkinson, a
sophomore from Chattanooga, Tennessee, was elected as
First Vice-President of the Student Body for the coming
year.'Perkinson, a member of Phi Delta Theta social fra-
ternity, is active in several organizations on campus, and
ranks high scholastically. The outcome of the Second Vice-
Presidential candidate race was still undecided at press
time.

The office of Secretary-Treasurer was also undecided
after today’s balloting. Ross Smyth, an SAE from Char-

Tyson Is Directing

Professor Raymond W. Tyson is
now directing a Red and Black
Masquers’ production of R. C. Sher-
riff's famous play, “Journey’s
End." which will be given at David-
son Friday and Saturday, April 29
and 30. Mr. Tyson feels that this
will be one of the outstanding pre-
sentations that he has guided since
his coming to Davidson College.

“Journey's End” is considered
to be a milestone in the history of
contemporary drama. A war play,
it is set in a trench of the First
World War and the characters are
Britishers. The tragedy of Stan-
hope, played by Dunbar Ogden,
Osborne, played by Fred Summers,
and Raleigh, playéd by Harold
Hall, is high tragedy in that these
men are English gentlemen who
express their sufferings in restraint
and refinement, lending a certain
noble dignity to the play.

“Journey’s End” centers around
young Cdptain Stanhope, a leader
of men who, in his refusal to com-
promise with feigned illness, has
succumbed to drink as‘ an escape
mechanism—a _ thing he would
have abhorred two years before.
Within these powerful three acts
are depicted men at war—with
their loves, their hates, their

hopes, and their fears.

Dances Will Follow

King Solomon notwithstanding—
“there is something new under the

precedent, the IFC has decided that

it may now reveal its long-antici-

pated triumph: Ralph Flanagan's
Orchestra will vibrate the David.
son campus during the Spring
Frolics dances April 22 and 23.

The desire to make this final
celebration most memorable to
graduating seniors and to buoy
the spirits of despairing under-
classmen as the end of another
year draws near, has led the IFC to
choose Ralph Flanagan, “Ameri-
ca's Number One Band,” to per-
petrate the syncopated background
for the Frolics finale.

As per usual the formal ball
from nine until one Friday night
will be followed by an informal
dance Saturday evening. A concert

In Mecklenburg County alone,
approximately 900 pints a month

that the need is great. The Red
Cross assures us that the blood
given will be used here in the
county. Last fall: only 206 pints
were given in the two-day “bleed-

cil is requesting a better turnout

proval of the Constitution was
voiced by 89 per cent of the stu-

votes totaling 502, negative 66. The
Constitution goes into effect at
the beginning of the 1955 fall
semester.

As a result of this passage,
YMCA membership has been
altered and clarified in order that
students should not automatically
become members of the Y upon
payment of their college fees in
September, as was previously the
case. The adopted Constitution
states that all students or members
of the faculty who are interested
in the Y program may become
members by signing a statement in-
dicating their desire to further
the purpose of the organization
and to contribute financially to its
advancement.

Other revisions of past procedure
include a redefinition of Y officers.
