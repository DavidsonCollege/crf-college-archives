out-guessed and out-maneuvered the Wolfpack receivers in in-
tercepting three passes in the fleeting moments of the game;
one good for 95 yards and the game-winning touchdown.

CONFERENCE CHAMPS? COULD BE...

As soon as the newspapers came out Monday morning with
conference standings, it was noted by many that Davidson was
tied with the loop Jeaders. But it didn’t stop there. Talk has
already begun about Davidson winning the Southern Confer-
ence. Sounds silly, doesn’t it. But just a minute . . . it's a possi-
hility. There are five conference games remaining on the Cat
sehedule—Richmond, Furman, The Citadel, VMI and W&L—
five hard games. Davidson could lose all of them, but if they're
in there fightin’, it’s more likely that they could win them all.
It will largely be a question of keeping the team keyed np men-
tally for the games each week. Might help if the student body
and administration would talk it up and let the team know
that they believe a Conference Championship is a possibility,
even though right now it seems a little remote.

By DAN McKEITHAN

fighting Wildcats who pulled a
great team victory over highly-
favored State last Saturday night.

How could any. individual play-
er be singled out as the outstand-
ing Wildcat? It was every mem-
ber of the team who went about
performing his own job in an in-
spired way that made the victory
possible. tt took every man working
j together to- beat a good team, to
beat a school which Davidson had
not beaten since 1936.

A good nomination “for the top
Wildcat man would be. little Jake

the fire with that much-talked-of

Sophomore of the Week in the
Southern Conference. The
selection was made by writers

ceptions immediately afterward.
You couldn't -go wrong on picking
Fullback C. L. Runyan, who was
picked by the Associated Press as
sophomore of the week. His two
kicks which went out of bounds
on the State one and three yard
lines were overshadowed ‘by his
brilliant plunging in the first half.
Never to be outdone the always
dependable Auburn Lambeth com-
pleted ten of 16 passes for 121
yards and one touchdown, and,
as if that wasn't enough, ran over
jor the Cats’ first score. But why
leave out the best all around back
on the squad, Jimmy Sifford? The
speedy Sifford looked very good
on receiving passes, especially the
short one he took for 32 yards
and paydirt; and he also. hit on two
out of three passes. We could go
on mentioning Woody Leach,
Charlie Rimer, and other backs.
You say we're leaving out that

end play of Hal Mapes, Nobody
could’ miss him when he was cut-
ting down that end-run_ interfer-
ence or siwgiehandedly pulling
down his man. Speaking of ends,
glue-fingered Mott Price continued
to pull in passes to keep his ‘high
national rating.

Have we gone through the nom.
inations without the name of Hen-
ry Wilson? You simply can’t fail
to mention the boy that’s one of
the hardest drivers in the business
There: weren't many tackles in
which Henry wasn’t involved and
one State drive was halted by Wil-
son’s interception,

We'll string along with the
Charlotte News in its pick of the
Wildcats as the TEAM of the
Week. We'll let you pick the Wild-
cat of the Week if you can.

Climaxes Big Win

By CHERRY STRIBLING

On a day of upsets all over the
country Davidson pulled one of the
most amazing by coming from
behind to trounce N. C, State 20-14
in a game that will be remembered
by Davidson followers as long as
the game of football is played.

The first half of Saturday night’s
ball game was as spine-tingling as
the whole game proved to be. State
scored their first touchdown easily
on the first five plays after they
touched the ball offensively, Tail-
back Ed Mooney ending the 35-
yard push with a 14-yard left end
run. The Davidson fans perhaps
lost heart at this turn of events but

cats. They started moving the ball
with C. L. Runyan carrying the
brunt of the load. Then on the
third play of the second period
Auburn Lambeth sliced over right
tackle, and copped a 39-yard drive

into a hole by his brilliant coffin
corner kicking. Hal Mapes kicked
the point and it was 7-7 at the
half and the stands were beginning
to warm up to the ‘situation.

On the kickoff at the second half
Ed Mooney raced 80 yards to score
and this perhaps lulled the State
team into docility, for the Wildcats
again took over and ran all over
State’s vaunted line. Then after
two minutes of thé fourth quarter
had elapsed Lambeth lobbed an

eight yard pass to Jimmy Sifford
in the flat and he sped down the
sidelines to send the Cat support-
ers into hysterics from which they
were. plunged back into gloom
when Hal Mapes missed the extra
point.

Everybody thought it was all
over then but a glorious moment
was yet to come, After State had
driven down to Davidson's nine
yard line using the “T”, Quarter-
back Ogden Smith faded back for
a pass and the rest is history. Lit-
tle Jake folded it in and making
like a rabbit in front of hounds
chugged 95 yards while everybody
from Davidson went crazy. Then
as if to prove that it was no freak
Jake intercepted two more passes
of Bill Thompson’s to put the
game on ice.

undoubtedly have victory in mind

when they meet St. Louis’ Billi-
kens tomorrow afternoon across
the Mississippi at 2:00 C.S.T. (3

p. m. E.S.T.).

Contrary to the opinion of many,

everything did not cease to func-

tion in the world of football when
the long.looked for win over the
Wolves from Raleigh came last
Saturday night. There remain sev-
en more games on the slate and as
Coach Charley said earlier in the
season, “We'll play them one at
a time this year.” °
The big question on the mind
of the Wildcat supporters tonight,
on the eve on their second inter-
sectional clash of the fall is this:
Can the Davidson attack continue
to operate as it did Saturday night
in Charlotte, and will their defen-
sive outfit be able to stop the T-
formation, a nemesis to them in
both the Army and Presbyterian

games.

St. Louis, better known for its
basketball brilliance than = grid
prowress, nevertheless sports -a

pretty fair ball club. Its line is one
of the largest in the nation easily,
averaging a cool 220 pounds. State
was supposed to have a rugged
wall, but C. L. Runyan cracked it
often and hard enough to earn the
Associated Press title of Southern
Conference Sophomore of the
Week. Davidson’s Bob Sharpe and
Buddy Chandler proved a good
match for the Pack’s touted Mus-
ser and Watts, and all around Da-
vidson looked far more like the
club that gave Army a nice fight
than the one that played dead in
the home opener to Presbyterian.

All week Coach Charley has
warned the crew of an air of com-
ptacency following the State win.
It was that air that lost the Pres.
byterian contest. This week's clash
with the Billikens may well set the
pattern for the rest of Davidson's
season. It will show whether they
have truly bounced back from the
P. C. loss as a different ball club
or just as one which blew its wrath
on State.

As usual, the attack will center
around brilliant passing by Auburn
Lambeth, and his pet receivers,
Mott Price and Pete. Brown in the
air, and Jimmy Sifford, C. L. Run-
yan, and (how-could-you-help-but-
include-him) Jake Wade on the
ground.

With the possible exception of
