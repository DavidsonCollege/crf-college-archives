There is a storm on the horizon. By the time you pick up

this paper, January 15th - the deadline for Iraq to withdraw |

from Kuwait - will be less than twenty four hours away. In-
deed the Middle East crisis is not Davidson’s No. 1 obession.
Student’s have just begun to open their textbooks for the new
Spring semester, and freshmen are still recooperating from
self-selection night. Atthe moment Davidson remains insu-
lated from the real world. Yet a dark gloomy cloud hangs
heavy over our head. .

Fortunately Davidson and other college campuses across
the land are still regarded as having an important input to the
current dilemma in spite of being so shelterd. Ina letter sent
to 460 college and university newspapers, President Bush ap-
pealed for support for a possible war in the Persian Gulf,
saying he might have to use force “to stand up for human
life.” Mr. Bush’s appeal in itself is indicative of how much
weight the administration gives to us.

Thus the activitism that happened on this otherwise apa-
thetic campus last semester must continue. And itis. Regard-
less of your ideological views there are plenty of activities on
campus. Editors, columnists and staff writers have worked
diligently to help compile this year’s first issue of The
Davidsonian which is filled with articles and op-ed pieces on
the Persian Gulf problem. Tonight at 7:30 the Dean Rusk
program is holding a Foreign Affairs forum on the Middle
East. On Tuesday at 5:15 a peace vigil is being held in front
of Chambers. Finally, on Friday Davidson students will be
leaving for Washington for a peace march.

Nonetheless, whether you believe U.S. involvement is
wrong or not, the important matter is to educate yourself.
Middle Eastern politics, of course, are confusing. Yet, as
today draws to aclose, the politics we once assumed perplex-
ing may unfortunately allow us to learn something greater

_about ourselves and this country in general.

The Davidsonian is published weckly on Thursday during the school-ycar by the
students of Davidson College.

Letters

"Queenies" Offer Rebuttal

To the Editor:

We have recently re-
ceived a copy of the article,
on “Where do Queen’s
WomenCome From?” Well,
first of all eighty percent
come from Davidson
Alumni. Yes, most
“Queenies” are educatedand
supported by their fathers
who graduated and married
a “Queenie.” So, actually
it’s Davidson Alumni who
give “Queenies” most of
their money.

I don’t think Cindy
Crawford would have en-
joyed this article. Since she’s
a “Queenie” and you think
all “Queenies” are “large-
haired socialites” who “blow
chunks” in your bushes.
Well, she has done her share

of partying at Davidson. And
you think we are dumb -
think again! Who are the
idiots that didn’t take the time
to know her - who only
passed here off as a “good-
looking Queenie?”
Anyway, how . many
Queens girls do you know?
How can you stereotype our
school, when you probably
can’t even recall the full
names of ten girls from
Queens. I’msureI can speak
for the majority of
“Queenies” that we don’t
really care what you think.
Our dads are rich and
we're a bitch. We have eve-
rything we need: our looks,
our large bank accounts from
our loving Davidson Alumni
father, and our stimulating
conversations with all of the

young male yuppies in Char-
lotte. These “out-of-gradu-
ate-men” who have realized
that “smartbuthomely” girls
may have a higher IQ;-but
shall we say, after marriage
and children, they also have
a much larger dress size.
(Don’t take this personally
Davidson girls - Davidson
guys said that one!)

How many models does
Davidson have? I don’tknow
but it’s funny there are al-
ways “Queenies” modeling
lingerie in your newspaper
ads. .
So if you don’t take the
time to really know a nice
“Queenie,” then you all are
the idiots - not'us!
Sincerely, ~
Your “Queenies”

Burns Burns Davidsonian

To the Editor:

Here it comes, my first
venture into the world of the
printed word since July . . .

I was reading The
Davidsonian (Nov. 15) and
keeping one footon the floor
after a hellacious night of
volumnious quantites of
French wine (legally!) when
Irealized that if I wanted the
bed tostop spinning, I’dhave
todrink more and pass outor
Stay up for another hour or
two. So I thought of tomor-
row morning and decided to
write this letter.

So here it comes.

“The South’s Foremost
College Weekly” was a
meager eight pages. Please -
you’d be lucky tobe the “The
South’s Least Read High
School Quarterly” at that
rate. And oh, I was filled
with such hope after the first,
revamped (and very good)
edition of this year’s
Davidsonian.

Since then, the paperhas
been filled with frivolous
squabbling over hairy legs

(no big deal really, I see them
all the time over here, arm-
pits too for that matter), and
libelous unprofessional rag-
ing over being towed from a

parking place you shouldn’t.

be in the first place. Please -
you ruin a man’s reputation
for two months and then
apologize with one para-
graph? Come on folks, half
of journalism isresearch, you
should know that.

Yes, between article _

repeats, tortuous paragraphs
of “Enjoy a Vegetarian
Thanksgiving” and pablum
- puking sports editorials,
there are some gems of good
college journalism. But one
gets tired of searching for
readable material in a publi-
cation from a school of
Davidson’s quality.

I_am especially. disap-
pointed in my successor. I
may not have been a great
Sports Editor, but at least I
managed to agitate the
administration occasionally.
I, andalotof other people on
this side. of the pond, are
tired of reading that “the

great, magnificent Davidson
Athletics department made
another superdecision. yes-
terday . . . brownnose...
brownnose.. . brownose . .
.““Come on Bruce, criticize!

You want my advice?
Too bad . .. Can everybody
and print the great photos,

Cobb, Tom Koonce, “Life
in Hell” and “Freddy” on a
mimeograph sheet and slide
under students’ ‘doors. You’!

save the ‘college a lot of

money and your reader a lot
of pain (although they might
miss the weekly laugh - they
need it with a 5-day exam
period).

Come on folks, I et
you can do better, after all,
you supported Harvey Gantt

tion, But that’s another let-

"Food Fine" Was."Fine" Success

To the Editor:

InDecember the Library

changed the overdue fine
system for the season allow-
ing cans of food for theneedy
to replace’ the financial
charges.

The “Fine Food” table

| inthe Library had on or under

or around it 1,760 cans of

food! Some folks who had

no overdue fines even
brought food to contribute.
It was aresounding success.

The food was given to
the Davidson Community
Center, thanks to the good
offices of Beth Duttera,
Campus Service Coordina-
tor. When all of the needs
were met there, over 200
cans were sent to Charlotte

to help with its ‘project for
the needy.
Thankstoeveryone who
made this project a big suc-
cess. “Fine Food” from “fine
people” for a “fine cause.”
Happy New Meat
