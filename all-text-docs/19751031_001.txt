College to raise $35 million

Williams releases development draft

An initial draft of a ten-year fund
raising program with an objective of
raising 35 million dollars for Davidson
College was released by Vice Presi-
dent for Development Craven E.
Williams.

The draft, tentatively entitled .

Focus: 150, is‘being submitted for
review by faculty, students, adminis-
tration and trustees, with the final
plan for developing financial re-
sources for Davidson to be endorsed
by the Board of Trustees at its
February, 1976 meeting.

According to Williams, the college
is presently raising approximately $2
million annually. The draft for the
new financial program calls for an
average of $3.5 million to be raised
annually for the next ten years.

‘“We’ve got to average nearly

twice our present figure. In that
sense, $35 million ia a very sobering
type of figure,’’ said Williams.

“The college always has an ongoing
development program, but with Fo-
cus: 150 we're talking about a highly
orchestrated capital fund raising pro-
gram with highly defined objectives.”

The draft calls for $10 million in
support for annual operations: $11
million. in support for teaching,
academic programs, and the library;
$8 million in support for student
scholarships and aid; and $6 million in
support for campus development.

The report cited capital improve-
ments with the highest priorities as
an arts building, a chemistry
building, field house and outdoor
athletic facilities, food services, stu-
dent housing, and warehouse and

shop facilities.

Priorities in teaching include en-
dowed professorships at $500,000,
endowed faculty development funds
at $25,000, and endowed faculty
support funds at $20,000.

Endowment funds for international
study, interdisciplinary study, expe-
riential learning, Honors Center, de-
partmental library and book funds are
objectives for academic program and
library support.

Endowed honor scholarships for
students at $75,000, endowed student
aid funds at $10,000 rank at top
priorities in student support.

‘$35 million is a tentative state-
ment of the college needs over the
next ten years balanced by a figure of
the college potential. Of course that
figure is subject to change as further

research defines our financial poten-
tial,’ said Williams.

‘This ten-year plan, if it is to have
any validity at all, must be revised
with new projections each year:”’

According to Williams, the college
will not be able to stay in the black
without a substantial boost of its
present capital fund raising.

“Times are such that colleges and
universities must maintain continual
and consistent programs in capital
development as in annual giving,”’

Williams foresees a deficit for
Davidson or cut-backs in program if
present capital funds are not in-
creased.

‘But we’re not going to let that
happen,”’ he said, ‘‘because we’re
going to keep expenses down and
increase our income.”’

According to Williams, the 60 page
internal case statement for the project
will be evaluated by the Faculty
Executive Committee and the SGA
Senate Executive Committee. Copies
of the draft are on reserve in the

Trustees grapple
with governance

By DAN THORP
Staff Writer

The Trustee Governance

Committee proposed to the
full board several amendments
to the Trustee By-laws in an
effort to conclude work ona
new college governance
system.

Debate at the October 17
meeting centered on amending
the president’s power to stay
or suspend actions taken by
faculty or students.

The current Trustee By-
laws empower the president
“to stay or suspend the effect -
iveness of any action by the
Faculty or by any Faculty or
student organization, and to
remand the matter to the
appropriate body or bodies for
further consideration, or to
bring it to the Trustees or
their Executive Committee for
review.”

The Governance Committee
proposed an amendment limi-
ting to seven days the period
of review by the Trustees or its
Executive Committee fol-
lowing the suspension, or the
suspension would be ter-
minated.

This amendment was not
acceptable to the board.

Phillips explained to Presi:
dent Samuel R. Spencer Jr.
that the amendment was never
intended to compell the board
to act within one week.
Rather, it was intended that
the board must initiate action
during that time.

A revised amendment. doc-
keted for action at the Feb-
ruary, 1976 meeting reads, ‘‘If
within the 7 day period the
Trustees or its Executive
Committee do not initiate
review, the suspension is ter-
minated. The Trustees or its
Executive Committee shall
make every reasonable effort
to determine any question at

issue within the 7 day period.”’

This-amendment does not
place a definite time limit on
the completion of trustee
review of a suspended action,
according to SGA President
John Munce.

‘“‘There has never been a
question of the right of trus-
tee review throughout the five
years; the main concern of
students is to limit the sus-
pension power so it cannot be
used as a pocket veto,’’ said
Munce.

“This new amendment is
not, what I voted for or what I
heard discussed in the Gover-
nance Committee. However, it
can be livéd with in the
context of the governance
system.

“The point of the resolution
was to insure that the trustees
act with some responsibility to
the rest of the community,”’

Spencer indicated that in-
definite suspension of faculty
or student actions is not the
intention of the amendment.
He claims that it is designed
to protect students and fac-
ulty from unlimited presi-
dential power.

Spencer expressed opposi-
tion to the original Gover-
nance Committee amendment
on the grounds that it would
force the trustees to act within
one week. He indicated that
the board should not have the
pressures of the seven day
limit when making such im-
portant decisions.

Spencer indicated his satis-
faction with a process similar
to that employed in amending
the Code of Responsibility.
This would necessitate that
suspension be submitted to
the Board of Trustees which
would then have to act on the

suspension within 30 days.

According to Spencer, this
would prevent indefinite sus-

Trustees approve changes
in infirmary staff, facilities

By SCOTT REID
Staff Writer

The Student Life and
Health Committee of the
Board of Trustees approved a
six-point plan to improve the
sevices and facilities at the
Preyer Infirmary as recom-
mended by the McFarland
report.

The first point in the plan
drawn from the report com-
piled by Doctors James A.
McFarland, Angus M.
McBryde, and Hugh D.Verner
calls for hiring of a physician’s
associate or nurse practitioner
to supplement the present
infirmary staff. It also calls for
the initiation of a search by
the college and the town of
Davidson for a full time physi-
cian to serve both.

“A physician’s associate
can do an awful lot for the
doctors in the infirmary,’’ said

Dean of Students Will H.
Terry who drew up the six-
point resloution approved by
the Trustees.

“He would be very helpful
to the athletic teams because
he could attend their home
games and be in attendance at
the infirmary when a doctor is
not.

“Dr. McFarland said that at
Duke University, where physi-
cians’ associates have been
employed for a number of
years, it has gotten so that the
students prefer to see one of
the associates rather than one
of the docotrs because the
associates can spend more
time with them.”

“Not only will the associate
at the infirmary save the
doctors time,”’ added Terry,
“but he will give more conti-
nuity as to who sees the
student.’’ At present there are
four doctors that serve the

infirmary on a regular basis.

The search for a physician
to serve both the college and
the town will be conducted by
a committee to include, among
others, Mayor Tom Sadler, at
least two students yet to be
named, and the town’s present
physician, 77 year old Dr.
James B. Woods.

The second point of the plan
calls for the college to secure
“adequate facilities for the
physician and the physician’s
associate.’’ The school will
consider remodeling the infir-
mary for use by both the
college and the community. In
such a. case the physician’s
offices would be in the Preyer
facility .

Point number three of the
plan directs the college ad-
ministration ‘‘to implement a
five year plan to upgrade the
