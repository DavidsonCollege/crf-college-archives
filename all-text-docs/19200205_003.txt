PROF. SHUMAKE GIVES
“y” EXCELLENT ADDRES

Speaks on College Boys’ Common
Fallacies as to School Life.

Professor Shumake, the professor
of English, made an unusually in-
teresting talk on “Popular Fallacies
in College Life” last Sunday night
at the “Y” service.

“One of the most common falla-
cies in college,” said Professor Shu-
make, “is that knowledge is acquir-
ed by loafing.” There is a vast dif-
ference between wise loafing, such
as going out for athletics, reading
good books, keeping the common
touch, and habitually wasting one’s
time by visiting. Cultivate friends
who can help you. Don’t get the
idea that time in plentiful. “Dost
thou love life? Then do not squan-
der time, fur time is the. stuff that
life is made of.” You are mortgag-
ing your future when you waste
your time,

Another fallacy is that service is
the most important thing in life. In
college, preparation for service is at
times more important. By being
willing to de anything for anybody,
you lose time in which you should
be developing your mental attain-
ments. For one can develop spirit-
ually and physically clsewhere, but
college is the finest opportunity to
develop one’s mental equipment. It is
better to do one thing well than
six things poorly. If a man expects
to be above the average, he should
do something more than the routine
work ; he should do something new,
something difficult. Don’t hesitate
tou encounter rebuffs. Train your-
self to do something well that you
don’t have to do, if you expect to be
above the average.

Professor Shumake in conclusion
said that unless you link your life up
with that of the divine, it: will be
like a beautiful lighting system that
is not in connection with a dynamo.

TWO SHOWS ON SAT. NIGHTS

Found Necessary to Handle Eager
Movie Fans.

The “Y" weekly movie sure gets
‘em all! Everybody comes and en-
joys it. The problem of accommo-
dating the crowd has been puzzling
the management for some time. The
attendance has so increased that
with the present facilties, the “Y”
is unable to accommodate the whole
crowd at one show. In order to
remedy this, Mr. Miles has decided
to have the show on Saturday night
instead of Friday night, and have
two shows. The first show, which
will be especially for the town peo-
ple and the students not in either lit-
erary society, will begin at 7 p.m.
The second show will begin at 8:30
p. m., immediately following the Jit-
erary society meetings. This is ex-
pected to divide the crowd about
equally.

The town people were disappoint-
ed at not bemg permitted to attend
the show last Saturday night. Ow-
ing to the “flu” situation Dr. MeCon-
nell, the college physician, ordered
that only students be permitted to
attend this show. This order will
probably be effective only for this
week.

VOLUNTEER BAND HOLDS
DEVOTIONAL MEETING

The last meeting of the Volunteer
Zand was purely devotional. The
band is usually so occupied with dis-
cussions and plans that the occa-
sional devotional meetings which it
holds are always warmly welcomed.
This meeting was led by Wilkinson,
who read an appropriate Scripture
text and called for discussion. Then
one and another, allaround the
room, testified to the importance of
preaching the “straight Gospel,” as
Dr. Whaling expressed it, in perfer-
ence to following the newer creeds.
Everyone was much impressed by
the earnestness and fervor with
which the various members made
their testimonies. The next meet-
ing will be given to a discussion of
prayer, the Morning Watch, and
kindred subjects.

NEWS OF OUR “Y” BROTHERS
AT OTHER COLLEGES

At Washington and Lee there are
15 student-led Bible classes with a
total enrollment of 225 and an aver-
age attendance of 160. All are led
by upper classmen. The leaders meet
in anormal class each Monday even-
ing, led by the head of the depart-
ment of English. The majority of
the classes are held on Tuesday eve-
ning. The text used is Fosdick’s
“Manhood of the Master.”

Thirty groups with an enrollment
of 400 men, are using “New Testa-
ment Ideals for the World Task"
at Tech. Student leaders are being
used entirely. These leaders meet
on Tuesday evenings, using H. 5.
Eltiot's book on Jeader training. This
plan is proving very successful ‘as
witnessed by the fact that all the
men in the dormitories and fratern-
ity houses are enrolled, with an at-
tendance record of approximately
98 per cent.

At Mississipp A. and M. there is
an enrollment of 985 out of a stu-
dent body of 1,100. The estimate of
the general secretary is that 60 per
cent of the fellows have done real
serious Bible study.

HOLLANDSWORTH ELECTED
TO LEAD MINISTERIAL BAND

The “Davidson Presbytery” held a
short meeting Sunday in which it
elected Hollandsworth, moderator,
and Bitzer clerk.  Uollandsworth
gave a short talk on the value of
secret praver, asking especially for
praver during the coming Volunteer
Convention. The meeting was clos-
ed by a short prayer led by the act-
ing moderator, Hunter,

BIBLE CLASSES.

nes

A lack of interest has been shown
in the Bible classes since Christmas.
Three floors had no class at all and
two floors only had three men out.
The regular Sunday school lessons
are being taught now and it is hoped
that the attendance will increase.
This week shows a gain over last
week and 200 is goal for next Sun-

day. ;

SUNDAY SCHOOLS.
The attendance at the Sunday

Schools was good considering the
fact that Flu is in nearly all the
communities where there are
schools. Only one school, Cowans,
did not have Sunday School on ac-
count of the epidemic. The num-
ber at the other schools was as fol-
lows:
