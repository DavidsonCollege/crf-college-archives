Move The wy”

A sizeable in the ballot-
ing for,the Y presidency has set many of us
to thinking about something that we should
have been thinking about long ago—that
is, the function of the Y, as it is and as it
should be.

For the purposes of

rather superficial groups. The first group,
we'll designate as the ‘‘religious emphasis’”’
group, though a group that we shall men-
tion next call them “the pre-ministerials.’’

students who feel that compulsory vespers
and chapel are enough of a good thing and
who feel that any effort on the part of any-

“yeligion’’ is uncalled for.
Our third: designation is for that larger

group of students who are rather pasgive
about the whole situation. They have no par-
ticular desire to enter actively into the work
of the Y, nor do they have any objections to
the Y’s program: They are just not —in-
terested in the Y°one way or the other.
Since every member ofthe student body
is a member of the Y, and since the Y is an
organization for all the students, these three
groups must all be taken into consideration
in the formulation of Y policies.

Traditionally YMCA’s meet this need with
a program of recreation, Before the war,

our YMCA headquarters was the recrea-
tional center for the entire student body.
Perhaps one reason why the Y rates low
with the average student because its
recreation facilities are - inadequate.

Maybe it would be best to move the Y
out of the guest house. The- rooms over
here are too small for the only pool table

In Appreciation

A complete-ehange-in-the masthead (that

conglomeration of names that appears at
the head of this column and is the only
formal recognition that most of the men
who work on this paper get) next week will
indieate that Bob Hollister, your newly-
elected editor, has taken over in his new
office,

Bob has worked diligently on the DAVID-

efficient and energetic, and under him, we
believe; the DAVIDSONTAN will have one
of the best years of its career. We want to
take this opportunity to thank him for his
great services this year, and to wish him the
best of luck next year,

We also want to recognize and show our
appreciation to Lonnie Turnipseed, Jack
Hazard and Doug Hix*for their help. Lon-
nie, better known 4s ‘“Roundman,’’ in his
third year of outstanding work for the pa-
per, handled the editorial page the first
part of the year and was later make-up man
for the front page. He was one of the guid-
ing lights: behind the April
}*ool’s issue.

Jack Hazard climaxed his three years on
the sports staff as sports editor this year.
His work speaks well for itself, and would
have spoken even louder if we had been able
to give him more space.

Doug Hix ,who was eligible to run for
editor, but for personal reasons did not,
has had the ticklish job of getting out as-
signments and keeping the reporters on their
toes. Without these three, and particularly,
the latter, we would have been lost, trying
te throw a paper together every week.

Also a geod word of appreciation_is in
order to the men behind the scenes on the
business staff—to John MeNair, the busi-
ness manager, to Wylie Smith, advertising
manager, and to Billy Houck, cireulation
manager. These three men and their helpers

Are You Satisfied With Chapel?

During the four years that I have
been in attendance at Davidson, vir.

After discussing a plan for the

faculty members and a reasonable

cross section of the student body,
it seems that few, if any, consider
the present set-up satisfactory or
even particularly beneficial; indeéd,

the student body. it
paradox that a service
should ever result in minimizing the

Chapel as we know it today is, in
my opinion, a non-deseript sort of

of the word), or “assembly.” What

that reason I would like to propose
the following plan. If it is not ade-

efforts from both the student body
and administration to save from

be of great value to all concerned.

strictly a student assembly with
no attempt to insert an unre.

and place for all student an-
nouncements, programs of a
secular nature, and for other
normal functions of the student
activities for thesé
days by their very nature would
be out of place in the chapel
service of the following day.

In thinking about this matter, it
admitted that the holding of
chapel and assembly in the same
auditorium on consecutive days pre-
sents difficulties. However, that
problem was for this writer largely
resolved when on Good Friday a
well-planned, simple, and beautiful
chapel service was obviously well

that resourcefulness on the part of
the Bible Department in working
out chapel programs would event-
ually, if not immediately, iron out
wrinkles in the transition from as-
sembly to chapel on the

Finally, this plan would prepare
students for the day (not far away,
it is hoped) when the new church
will be completed. The chapel serv-
ices can then be held in the church
auditorium and the student assem-
blies in Chambers, Until that is
possible, however, let us strive to
do the best we can with what we
now have on hand. The result, I
believe will be far superior to that
which exists today.

Other Colleges Say

This bit of irony about the fu-
tility of being a college professor
has appeared in most every college

rag in circulation so it is time it
got in the Davidsonian. “If he's
brand new at teaching, he lacks
experience. If he’s been teaching

all his life, he’s in a rut. If he uses
notes, he’s unoriginal. If he gets
along without notes, he’s an ad-
libber. If he sticks to his specialty,
he’s gota one track mind. If he
tours the he’s a
show-off. [f he’s young, he needs
more If he’s old, he’s
seen If he gives a
lot he's a_ slave-driver.
If he seldom gives a test, he’s too
lazy to read papers.”

Speaking of professors, those at
the University of Michigan have
to watch their step. The adminis-
tration takes a poll among the stu-
dents to determine which profes-
sors are the most popular or un-
popular. Many of the latter have
lost their jobs. This system, the
administration claims, is the most
effective way of weeding out those
professors whose personality flaws

Tech has announced the plans for
the final dance of the year. The
“Slobovian Stomp,” as it is called,
is advertised as being the most dif-
ferent type dance that the campus
will ever see. Its uniquéness will
be in the manner of attire to be
worn by the participants. The mot-

The University of Alaska boasts
of being the nothern-most school
in the world. According to its pa-
per, the FARTHEST-NORTH
COLLEGIAN, the activities are
about the same as those of other
schools except that all the students
cut when it gets-to be 40 below.
Its unique points are that students
wear beards, and play football in
“mukluks,” mittens and_ scarfs.

The PARLEY VOO of Con-
verse printed. a sarcastic little story
entitled “Men.” An excerpt goes
something like this: “Man is just a
worm in the dust. He comes along,
wiggles around for a while, and
finally some chicken gets him.” The
OLD GOLD AND~-BLACK of
Wofford couldn't. resist the follow-
ing retorts on this little piece of
satire. “If he crawls around, he’s
not a man. Men only let themi-
selves be picked up by girls that
hatched from golden eggs. Where
do you hide them?” And, “if it
weren't for worms, the chickens
would starve. Some of those babes
look like they haven't been fed a
good worm in a long time.” And a
poet contributes his masterpiece:
“If men were worms, and women

chickens,
Women sure would take a licking,
Sitting ‘round all day a ’pecking,
Scratching worms instead of neck-
ing.” -
