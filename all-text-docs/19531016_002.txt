The Grads Come Back

Homecoming is here again, and hundreds of men who
cali Davidson their Alma Mater will be on hand around the
campus during fhe weekend.

The Davidson that they will see will be in many ways
the same place they left years ago, but in many ways it will
seem quite a different place. ;

Certainly the face of Davidson has received considerable
lifting in a little more than a decade. A graduate of the mid-
thirties returning to the campus for the first time as an
alumnus would probably recognize the place, but would cer-
tainly be more than a little aware of the building program
that began in the early forties, and is still in progress.

Certainly there are many things that would lead him to
believe that this place is quite different from the college he
left 15 or 20 years ago.

On closer examination, however, he would most likely
come to the conclusion that though there have been more
than a few outward changes here at Davidson, its really not
much different from the school he left.

The things about Davidson that distinguish it from other
schools are still here, though old professors and old buildings
have gone, and new and unfamiliar ones have replaced them.

We like to think of how Davidson has grown, and indeed
it has more than kept pace in changing times. But it is still a
small college as educational institutions go, and still has all
the advantages, and indeed many of the disadvantages of such
an institution.

We are still proud of many of the same things that the
college took pride in during years gone by. When others
deride our athletic teams, which are indeed seldom winners,
we point to the heavy schedule, and remind them that David-
son is one of the remaining schools where liberal education
is the primary objective; we bask in the high academic repute
in which the college is held, at least in the South; we point
with pride to the many Rhodes scholars she has produced—
three alumni are studying at Oxford today; we still have one
of the best honor systems in any school anywhere.

Of course, we still have our faults as well as our strong
points. Students say that the college is too paternalistic, and
faculty members answer that the college has to be, because
students are so immature. We still go to chapel every day,
and to church every Sunday night. Lots of people don’t like
this, but most take it in their stride, realizing that in this
respect what is true today was true yesterday, and probably
will be true tomorrow, and perhaps it has good points after
all.

Davidson looks different from the way it used to, true,
but fundamentally it hasn’t changed a bit.

Independence From What?

One of the strangest chapters in the history of student-
faculty relationships at Davidson transpired last Monday aft-
ernoon at a meeting of the YMCA Board of Directors held to
consider the budget for the present school year.

The walls of the Union’s Blue Room were witness to the
unique spectacle of a board meeting in which faculty members
were urging greater student responsibility and independence,
while the student representatives were by and large far from
being enthusiastic about such prospects.

Upon closer examination, though, the reasons behind the
seeming reversal of roles became readily apparent.

The topic of controversy conggrned whether or not the
YMCA was to assume full responsibility for the salary of the
newly-appointed secretary, Sam Magill, or whether the col-
lege itself should relieve the Y of part of this responsibility.

As might be expected representatives of the college ad-
ministration, who had assumed the Y would assume the full
share of responsibility, were in favor of including that amount
in the Y budget, with the understanding that the college would
gladly underwrite the $1,530 deficit this would make in the
tentative budget presented earlier in the year by Treasurer
Buddy {.xaon. This deficit was entered under income as gifts
from alumni and friends in the budget which was finally ap-
proved.

Furthermore, the supporters of this plan contended that
it would make the YMCA a more independently operating
organization.

We were among those students who opposed this proposi-
tion at the Board meeting on the grounds that it would seem
unwise to establish a precedent which would possibly make the
Y habitually dependent on aid from outside the campus.

It seemed to us at the time that the YMCA at Davidson is
not merely a student organization, but is, and rightly should
be, a college YMCA. Since religious life here centers about
the Y, and the college administration is vitally interested
in the religious experience of each student, it appeared
reasonable to us that the college administration should assume
a more formal financial responsibility in connection with the
Y Secretary.

We further failed to see the advantage of freedom from

Liberal Trend Evident In Recent
Alterations In College Policy?

The recent decision of the facul-
ty to abolish the aggregate limit
on cuts came as a welcome relief
to students who have too long been
held to a precious few cuts -a
semester. This move reputedly
eame because the old aggregate
system entailed too much book-
work and red tape than its useful-
hese warranted.

Viewed out of the context of
recent college policies, this move
would seem only the lessening of
one of the major evils of the pres-
ent system of student regulation.
But if I may be allowed to become
a little optimistic, it does seem
that the abolition of the aggrega-
tion system might’ be a step—
though a very small one—toward
a more liberal Davidson.

Other Recent Changes

It is, of course, always easy to
see what you want to see—if you
look long enough and hard enough.
But two other major changes in
policy in the last decade make it
seem that college authorities, al-
though certainly not heeding Alex-
ander Pope’s advice to “Be not
the first by whom the new is
tried,” are at least following the
later half of that sage gentleman’s
advice of, “Nor yet the last to cast
the old aside.”

It was not long ago that when
the students wanted to have
dances, they had to contract for a
ballroom in Charlotte or another

By DICK ROPER

of the surrounding towns and then
spend the better part of the week-
end commuting to and from Da-
vidson in the wee hours of the
weekend mornings. And in the
process they spent a great deal
more on gas and put a lot more
mileage on theif cars than many
fathers could afford. College
authorities, seeing the danger of
having to do so much driving, and
possibly seeing how behind the
times they were, finally consented
to let the dances be held on the
campus which of course was the
only prudent and reasonable way
to handle the situation. That was
only one small move, but it did
represent a major change in policy.

Second Major Change

The second major policy change
in the last decade came with the
faculty decision to let students
keep cars on the campus. The
argument against this move, as I
understand it, was that the quali-
ty of the students’ work would
drop if they were allowed this
privilege. In the few years that
the new rule has been in opera-
tion, I do not believe it is true
that there has been any marked
decrease in the work done by stu-
dents. In fact, this year’s senior
elass, which came in right after
the new ruling on cars was made,
is said to be one of the smartest
at Davidson in years.

It goes without saying that

should any of these privileges be
really abused, the faculty would be
justified in taking them away. (But
it is to be fervently hoped that
the Davidson professors who would
actually be in favor of having stu-
dents park their cars on Sunday
night and not get in them until
Saturday noon, will not succeed in
getting the rules changed because
a few students abuse the privil-
ege.)

Presage New Liberalism?

It is perhaps too much to hope
that these recent shifts in college
policy presage a new liberalism.
That, it seems, is not in the cards
for Davidson. But it is to be hoped
that as other colleges in the coun-
try move toward more liberal pol-
icies, Davidson will realize that
there is some value in what the
others are doing and at least go
along with the crowd.

In my wildest dreams it is posst-
ble to see Davidson, still as a
small, liberal arts school, with a
friendly atmosphere about the
campus—yet without the leash of
a rigid cut system on the stu-
dents, without compulsory attend:
ance at worship service, and with-
out the general paternalism now
prevalent on the Davidson campus.
But time does change things, and
it is barely possible that the next
generation of Davidson students
may receive the benefits of a more
liberal college.

What Makes Astaire A Star?

Davidson Homecoming Guide

Dancing in all its forms can-
not be excluded from the cur-
riculum of all noble education:
dancing with the feet, with
ideas, with words...

—F, Neitzche

As Fred so aptly suggests, danc-
ing is too often neglected in to-
day’s curriculum.

And, curriculum being restricted
largely to dances and football
games, the world has yet to find
a complete and authentic guide to
curricular dancing. Bascom Luns-
ford writes about dancing for
squares; Fred Astaire does the
ballroom job; the Devidsonien this
week brings you those steps Miss
Kittredge Never Mentioned, or
Other Foxy Trots.

First we have the Devil and the
Deep Blue Sea Step, mostly for
fraternity pledges. It’s one step
the girls don't need to learn. Let's
say Pledge A is told separately by
Brothers B and C that he is to
date their sisters, fresh out of
Kernersville Junior High.

Pledge A coughs into the Devil

both of them, “I'd lub to hab you
ub for the dadze,” gets two re-
fusals for sanitati€n’s sake.

How about, you say, the less-
than-fortunate blind daters? How
about the fellow who meets his
blind date at the train and finds
out his fraternity brothers really
do hate him?

Now's the time for the Cincin-
nati One-Step. Start with your left
foot, tale one step onto the’ train
she got off, wave to her, and in
a day and a half you'll be in Cin-
cinnati.

With Charlie Spivak's permission
we'd like to introduce the Fort
Benning 4Step this weekend.
Done to “The Stars and Stripes
Forever,” it has been carefully
outlined by the Department of the
Army:

STEP: A step is a step.

(a) 4STEP: Four steps is
six steps.

COMMAND: ‘In two parts:
Preparatory command, Detail;
command of execution, HUP,
TRUP,THRUP, FRUP, HRLUP.

OFFENSIVE MOVEMENTS
(Man’s part): Place foot, left,
out in a line, straight, paral-

lel with a line, straight, drawn

parallel with pender, sus, left,

your.

On the command TRUP, ex-
tend foot, left. THRUP: ex-
tend foot, left. FRUP: you
can't stand up, can you Mis-
ter? HRULP: without moving
right foot, bring foot, right,
upon line with foot, left.

I hate to go out on a limb, guys
and gals, but it'll be the rage at
the Scabbard and Blade Ball,

For you women, maybe he'll take
you out driving after the dance.
There’s a figure for that, too,
known around the Tri Delt house
as the “Why Did the Chicken Cross
the Road”—=step.

Consists of a shift to the right,
a twirl with arms extended, then
182 short steps. The object is to
cross the road, and get as far out
of sight as possible before he pries
his hand out of the door.

Like Fred said, it’s a sad world
that’s forgotten how to dance. Try
it soon, this weekend, tonight!
Remember now, Havelock Ellis
says

Dancing . .. it is life itself.

Does Long Ago Carolina Inn
Tie Davidson To Hinton Helper

Davidson has not claimed a close
association with the man who near-
ly as much as any single person
played a large part in hastening
the Civil War but who once
walked near and surely on her
campus.

What is now known as Carolina
Inn was once a hotel and was
owned by this man’s brother, Han-
son Pinkney Helper, and was the
frequent place of visiting of Hin-
ton Rowan Helper himself.

Hinton Rowan Helper’s connec-
tion with our school is perhaps a
bit shadowy to follow and we may
be somewhat hard pushed to pin
down any strong claim we might
have to him. So we won't press
the point, but the fact that he did
visit so close to the campus and
his brother once ran a_ business
which was housed in a building
that is now owned by the college,
does present a closeness that cer-
tainly ties him in our realm.

In the same year that Davidson
opened her doors to the first stu-
dents, 1837, what is now called
Cardlina Inn was constructed. The
authority for the date is an in-
scription on the chimney, “L. Din-
kem, 1837,” and sets off in our
minds a moment of great import.

The building was not in its pres-
ent size and shape, for it was not
until 1855 that Hanson Pinkney
Helper, one of Hinton's two broth-
ers, bought the place from the
Dinkem’s, and later, in 1860, the
Helper Hotel was opened for lodg-
ing and feeding accommodations
after much expanding the original
structure.

Dr, Lingle writes fondly of play-
ing backgammon with Mr. Pink-
ney Helper while Dr. Lingle was
a student here. Most memorable
about the Helper Hotel, as it was
known, was the perfectly kept and
scrupulously cleaned flower garden
of which Mr. Helper was most
proud.

The flower garden was to the
left of the house, facing the street,
and as well there was a summer
house in which Mrs. Helper en-
tertained the girls’ beaus.

In 1902 the place was sold to
the Sloans who let it run down
from the Helper’s impeccability
and who continued to use it as
an inn. In 1946, the college bought
the building and property with

By JIM MOORE

the intention of someday turning
it into a guest house.

Future plans for the inn are in-
definite, as the early plans for
another guest house seem  un-
necessary to college authorities
now, and there is a good possi-
bility, or so Dr. Spencer reports,
that a motel may soon be built
near Davidson.

Hinton Rowan Helper was a pre-
cocious figure for his times. Hav-
ing received little formal educa-
tion (it is recorded that he finished
Mocksville Academy which corre-
sponds somewhat closely to our
high school) perhaps his greatest
apprenticeship to knowledge of
the world came when he worked
his way aboard ship around the
Cape from New York to California.

It was in the gold state that he
saw at first hand the benefits of
a non-slavery economy and had
such a great impression made on
him by his findings in California.

His first book, “The Land of
Gold,” (1855), is alleged to have
held some references to his anti-
slavery views that were deleted by
the publisher. This was but a por-
tent of what was to come.

It was in the following year that
his monumental analysis of the
economic structure of the South
was published and created such a
furor—“The Impending Crisis.”

“The Dictionary of American
Biography” has this to say of Help-
er’s book, “It caused a sensation,
one far greater than “Uncle Tom’s
Cabin.” It was furiously attacked
in the South but few dared to read
it and it thus remained without an
adequate answer.”

What Harriet Beecher Stowe
lacked of reason was made up by
sentimentality, Helper supplied,
filled and overflowed in logic. The
Southerner had found their match
in the slavery question .. . and in
a Southerner.

The DAB summarizes Helper's
argument in this way: “Contrast-
ing the economic condition of the
free and slavery states (using as
his text the official census re-
turns), he attributed the backward-
ness of the South to the impover-
ishment of free labor by slavery.
There was no trace of interest in
the Negro and his real or fanciful
wrongs.”

He went on to show that slowly

the institution of slavery was
strangling the economic strength
of the South. Instead of cotton
being King, the hay crop of the
North and West were worth more.
In the South, valuable timber was
rolled into great piles and burned
to clear the land. Most devastaing,
he revealed that the annual value
of Southern exports was steadily
declining, whereas the value of
imports annually increasing.

So violent was the reaction in
the South against the book that
his own state legislature of North
Carolina passed a sedition law mak-
ing even the possession of the
book a felony. In R. C, Lawrence's
article, “Ten of Our Author’s” in
The State (date unavailable), he
writes of a minister who was con-
victed under this law and who
escaped his prison term only by
the expedient of forfeiting his
bond and escaping to the protec-
tion of a Northern State.

Helper was even forced, for his
personal safety, to withdraw him-
self from the state to New York,
soon after the book was published

“The Impending Crisis,” was
adopted in 1860 as one of the of-
ficial books for the Republican na-
tional campaign. Partly through
this backing and partly through
the natural interest the book en-
gendered, it gained the widest cir-
culation of any book in the pre-
Civil War era.

How could such a man who did
so much to cause the sharpening
of the issues for the War have
been so overlooked in history?

His point of view was not sym-
pathetic to slave-holding interests
in the South, so that part of his
public was lost to him for an
honorable memory.

Helper never had any genuine
sympathy for the Negro, and so
the Northern abolitionists would
not completely accept him in their
fold. Fortunately for Helper, Presi-
dent Lincoln assigned him as the
American Consul to Argentina in
Buenos Aires, during the War.

We must as well remember that
in the South possession, much less
accurate knowledge, of “The Im-
pending Crisis” was grounds for
legal action and undoubtedly social
ostracization as well.

Thus it was that a man who set

Homecoming!-- Decorations, Alumni, Women;

With All This, How You Gonna Fight It?

Well, here we sit in the midst of
the first official holiday of the
year — Homecoming. Invariably,
three things are associated with
this Roman Holiday: decorations,
prosperous alumni and women. For
the freshmen, it will be their pri-
mary initiation into the rigors of
a dance weekend, and also they
must acclimate themselves to the
somewhat traumatic experience of
having a collective group of women
on the campus after a month or
so of rationing and self-denial. The
upperclassmen, knowing vaguely
what to expect, catch up on their
sleep as much as possible and make
attempts to decorate and tidy up
for the incoming visitors. Many
have trepidations about any infor-
mation arriving suddenly by phone,
mail or wire, because the “flush”
is no respecter of age, fraternity
or social standing.

When the alumni arrive, they
will find many things which cer-
tainly have changed since the
“good old days.” Last year the
great edifice on the southwest cor-
ner of the campus had just been
completed; this year the Student
Union is functioning full force,
cafeteria and all. In the foresee-
able future, the ground for the
new Belk dormitory will be cleared
and building will begin.

Matertally, it is an impres-
sive record. Yet these innova-
tions also bring problems
which were nonexistent in
previous years.The fraternities
have been strained to accept
the method of requiring fresh-
men to eat in the cafeteria, and
have had to alter thelr pre-
vievs programs of working
with pledges. To their credit,
this transition seems to have
been made with e minimum
of friction with elther the
pledges or the administration.
Lately, a rumor has been float-
ing about that some of the fra’
ternities have been trying to
undermine the Union in the
minds of the freshmen. We
believe this rumor to be com-

By RONALD WILSON

pletely unfounded, since no
group realizes more fully how
dependent they are upon the
good will of the Administra-
tion for existence then do the
faternities.

Some of the objections of last
year to this system have mani-
fested themselves—others have not
arisen. One manifestation—the re-
action of the freshmen to the long
lines and limited quantity of food
—was completely overlooked last
year, but it is making itself felt.
This year’s class spirit—another
objective—seems to be as preva-
lent as any of previous classes, but
whether it is being channelled in

tionable.

So far, everything is in the
experimental, or trial-ander-
ror, stage. This Homecoming
may be the first in the “Age
of Transition” et Davidsen, As
yet, the direction of this tran-
sition is undetermined; wheth-
er this is a period of change
is even dubious. So, Alumni—
we welcome you! But if the
facilities which we have new
far surpass anything existent
during the old days, so de the
problems of finding out how te
dpa! with them equitably.

Women, we welcome you with

the hoped-for direction is ques-jno reservation whatsoever!
