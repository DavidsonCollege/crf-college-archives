Lying on My Stomach: A Vision

Lying, appalled by words and words and spinning
Words. Cat and I. I lying, she tentative

She poking, treading over the grotesque mound
Of Gulliver (that is me on my stomach lying)
Looking for the place I know she'll find, curling
About my lower vertebrae, her motor

Vibrating, feeble fragile echo of my

Own (only quicker) booming ticker—little
Hesitant twitching feline harlequin

Curling around the sticks, the bones of my
Poising, my bowing, my swaying somewhere
Near where they say the seat of the passions lies-
Her little motor, her quicker beating—not

A heart—not a clock—just a furry beating,
Beating. My heart is wings beating on both sides...

I am become land, terrestrial

With vernal life humming beating

Furious yet comfortable, erratic

Beating above me— me stretched along— time is
Different from head in clouded eve to feet

In opening dawn. I stretch. Above the humming hums.
I stretch above another sublime beating.

The soul-beating of the world, pulsing the lava

- Through my veins that warms the furry humming from
below.

From above another warming warms the humming

A beaming paternal countenance. Lo,

The leaves toward the father, the roots toward

Me. I am mother. I am heartbeat beneath

Human heartbeat of flutter, harlequin, crazy purr.

I am God that never was in mind of Man.

And now I roll.

A stiff neck rolls the gross, distorted face from

Its private cloud and the mountain proper follows.
And the purring tumbles off.

_ And Gulliver is made mote.

The Earth’s scalp warms only to that beaming
Paternal countenance above it all. °

_ Linda Hulbert ‘83

8S THE DAVIDSONI

Opening Cupboards

I ask the cups,

. those hollow eyes

whose words they want
and how to fill
them.

The Cold Came In

like a stranger

shook his overcoat
of furry breath,
stamped big footed frost
across the floor,

took the corner chair.
He stared |
hard and pale

at the fire.

This rude intruder
with the ragged hair
blows on his hands,
shifts his bulk

and settles in

to snarl

till spring.

Solo

And the father said
sing all the verses
he taught her;
little parrot
white cockatoo.
She stood on the tall chair,
his arm on her arm
reaching up
for a rescue
from the moment.

Time when the voice

would stop, a note explode,
and she would hear
him forty years

later in a green place

he imagined for her.
