Fired Again, Files Suit

Blackout Belk Arena

Ever since the Men's Basketball
team's brief appearance in the Top
25, Davidson Athletic Director Bill
Dunphee has been. searching for
new and different ways to attract
the national spotlight. That effort
continues on Wednesday night, as
Schlitz Malt Liquor has agreed to
sponsor the home game against
Elon.

MADE MILWAUKEE FAMOUS®,

McKillop’s favorite postgame brew

The night has been dubbed
“Blackout Belk,” continuing a tra-
dition that dates back to 2006. At
this particular game, each fan
receives a black t-shirt upon
arrival, resulting in a completely
“blacked-out” arena. Ideally, the
sheer darkness will strike fear in
the opposing players and force
them into nervous, sloppy play.
The new sponsor, however, adds an

entirely new dimension to the
event.

The contract stipulates that
Schlitz will host a tailgate starting
at noon in the Baker parking lot,
provide incredibly cheap drink spe-
cials throughout the day and night,
and conduct a half-time promotion-
al contest in which inebriated stu-
dents attempt to dunk with the aid
of those super-springy trampolines.

“Tt is our hope that encouraging
our students, faculty, season ticket
holders and heck, even children, to
‘black out,’ will turn Belk Arena
into one of the most intimidating
home courts in college basketball,”
Dunphee said.

Certainly, aggressive drinking
has helped the ‘Cats before.
Students filled the streets of
Charlotte when tailgating before
the Chapel Hill game, and then car-
ried the party inside, inspiring the
team to near victory over the Tar
Heels. That night, of course, ended
in a violent 40-person brawl out-
side Bobcats Arena. Police Chief
Fountain Walker has assured us
that such a brouhaha will not be
repeated.

“We expect close to 5,000 people
at this game, which, according to
Davidson's Risk Management poli-
cies, requires 2,000 police officers
on hand.”

In addition to Schlitz, other
sponsors include Mike's Hard
Lemonade and Jungle Juice.

Fed up with a lifetime of short
stints of employment and numer-
ous career changes, Jacobi

Middleman has finally decided to -
fight for his right to work.

Middleman gets shafted again.

On Tuesday he filed a wrongful
termination lawsuit against his for-
mer employer, the Union Café.

Middleman can't remember the

Townie Gets Town
Nomination for SGA

Milford Beckett, an area man
who has lived in Mecklenburg
County since his birth in 1936,
announced Tuesday that he
planned to join the race for the
position of Student Government
Association President.

A press release cited his motiva-
tions as: demonstrated capability in
leadership positions, a disdain for
change, and a concem that “those
college brats are going to spill their
soy milk and falafel sandwiches on
my favorite chair at Raeford's.”

Beckett feels that his campaign
platform will appeal to
Republicans and Townies upset
with the volume of Court parties,
as they make it “damn near impos-
sible to enjoy a good episode of
Matlock.”

Proposed changes include replac-
ing behind-the-desk work/studies
with internships at local auto
garages and the dismantling of the
Free Speech Board. Pabst Blue
Ribbon would become the “official
brew of Patterson Court,’ and
“Lights-Out Davidson” would ini-
tiate an 8:15 p.m. cut-off of elec-
tricity across campus.

“Tf elected, I expect I'll give those
silver-spoon Northerners a hearty
ass-whooping,” Beckett wheezed.
“Tf not, I'll just go back to my
house on Thompson Street and suf-
fer through the rest of my retire-
ment by scaring kids off my lawn
and giving out Tums on
Halloween.”

last job he held down for more than
two months, and he is quick to
blame his lack of job security and
history of exclusion on his unfortu-
nate last name.

“My entire life I've always been
the first to go,’ Middleman
explained. “Left off the kick ball
team at recess, blackballed from
my fraternity, cheated on by every
girlfriend, and now this.”

According to the former self-
styled “quesadilla maestro,” the
Union Café fired him for the most
mundane of infractions.
Middleman claims he was let go
for refusing to wear the Café-
endorsed sneaker, all-white Keds.
He prefers Asics, and he's not
going down without a fight. He has
hired former heavyweight student
attorney Joseph B. Adams to repre-
sent him.

“It was simple Economics, not a

footwear disagreement,” Café
manager - Marty Edgerton
explained. “Cutting him out just

made the most sense.”
