WASHINGTON (CPS) - As the
April 15 tax deadline approaches,
the Internal Revenue Service re-
minds students that their scholar-
ship money may be considered
taxable income.

Any scholarship money ap-
plied by a student to room, board
or travel expenses -) when the |
scholarship is above a certain
minimum - has been considered
taxable income since 1987.

According to the IRS, any
student who is claimed as a de-
pendent on his or her parents’ tax
return must pay taxes if they make
more than $3,400, including
scholarship money or financial
aid applied to room, board or
travel.

If a student is not claimed by
his or her parents, the income is
not taxable, unless it exceeds
$5,500. That amount also in-
cludes scholarship money or fi-
nancial aid applied toroom, board
or travel.

Any scholarship money used
for books, supplies and tuition is
still tax-free.

The IRS says students who
don’t’ claim. their scholarship
money on their tax returns ahd are
caught are subject to pay tax due
plus a penalty of up to 25 percent
of the unpaid amount.

On Monday, March 23, Char-
les Rose, North Carolina’s Sev-
enth District Congressman and the
President of the North Atlantic
Assembly, gave a talk on “The
Role of NATO in the New World
Order.” Rose was first elected to
Congress in 1972 and has served
ten consecutive terms.

Rose, Davidson Class of ’61,
asserted that, even with the Cold
War over, NATO (North Atlantic
Treaty Organization) is stillneeded
and strove to answer the very press-
ing question - “Is NATOrelevant?”

* Rose explained that the years
1989 through 1991 totally changed
the entire world order. He ex-
plained that the only other times
the world has achieved such an
incredible shift were after the two
world wars and after Napoleon’s
defeat in 1850.

He explained how.the NATO
alliance, ever since its establish-
ment ih 1949, has embroiled itself
in the Cold War to fight commu-
nism. NATO has been completely
successful, he said, in'that, China
is the only major communist power
left in the world.

NATO grew from Woodrow
Wilson’s fourteen point proposal
to establish a world peace-keeping
and security organization that re-
ceived very little attention when it
was proposed. Since then the US
government’s economic waste and
preoccupation with conflicts in
other countries such as Vietnam
and Korea during the Cold War
has hindered Wilson’s dream. He
said that one NATO function that

“changing a world of monarchs to
a world of democracies.”

Rose spoke at length about
America’s role in NATO and for-
eign policy. He said he realizes
and understands that today’s aver-
age American is not terribly. con-
cerned about foreign policy in light
of current economic and social
conditions withinthecountry. But,
he said, the issue still needs to be
addressed because of its relevance
to our role in world politics.

He also pointed out America’s
unenthusiastic tolerance of the
United Nations. “America using
its power doesn’t mean abusing
it... America needs to lead this world
in peace,” he said.

Rose defined two goals for
American foreign policy. First, he
said, America should embrace the
opportunity to create a world of
democracy that the ending of the
Cold War presents. Foremost, he
said, this involves cleaning up the
debris of the Cold War. He said
that we should dismantle the “bal-
ance of terror”, also known as the
nuclear arms buildup and the
competition between the US and
the old USSR, help the republics of
the old USSR in establishing their
democracies, and impres  -"9n
China the advantages of dem.
racy without jamming itdown the.
throats.

Second, he said, Americaneeds
to establish and list its priorities in
foreign policies concerning the
collective security and peacekeep-
ing abilities of NATO, and NATO
itself needs to collectively address

needs to prove that it is willing and
able to lead the world in punishing
countries that violate established
regime,” Rose said.

Rose asserted that it is impor-
tant to use NATO only as longas it
is valuable.. The environmental
challenge has become multiple and
pressing and has takencenter stage
in the new world order, he said.
NATO needs to take this challenge
to task and prove its adaptability to
changing times, Rose said.

Now that the. world’ has ‘es-
caped the Cold War, NATO has
“crossed a divide,” Rose said.
“NATO has engaged in a de facto
expansion forum for negotiations
around the world... NATO mustbe
flexible and open minded...NATO
no longer means military. NATO
means.diplomacy,” he said.

The fact that other nations have
asked to join NATO and the idea
that there is need to address all
world problems with an empliasis
on security are two more pressing
concerns, Rose said.

In a response to a question
concerning the possible admittance
of third world countries in the Far
East, Africa and South and Central
America, Rose spoke of the simple
fact that these nations need eco-
nomic resources NATO does not
have at its, disposal.

Rose closed with the advice
that we “tip our hats to the winner
of the 1919 Nobel Peace Prize and
former President,, Woodrow

> Wilson, in. his. presenting of a
‘ complex challenge that the world

must answer and overcome.”
