_ Honors College

(Continued From Page 1)

“It is recommended.’ con-
tinues the proposal, “that the
Center for Honors Studies.
return to the normal grading
procedures used by Davidson
College."

It is also suggested that the
dean of the center “engage in
immediate negotiation with the
chairmen of departments of-
fering honors programs to
develop some organic relation-
ship between the Center and the
departments.’

The recommendations see the
Center for Honors Studies as ‘a
service function for the entire
college’’ whose resources

should be used “to improve the
entire program.”

Atan Biakiey. chaurnian of the
Committee to Continue the
Honors College. which initiated
the student petition. was op-
timistic about the faculty's

decision.

“IT think they'll accept the
vote and will work together
during the trial period.” he
said.

“I'm not sure what effect the
petition had, but if it got one
vote, it pushed us over.”
LStcm ben caededeeed

“I think the morale will im-
prove these coming months,”
he said. “The struggle to keep
the Honors College has brought
its students together over com-
mon ground. ~

The letter to the faculty
protesting the petition was from
Senior Douglas Sittler.

Sittler considered the petition
“invalid because it did not
fairly represent the two sides of
the question.’ and charged that
the alternative to incorporate
honors level studies into the
regular college curriculum was
not mentioned.

... Freed Paints With Grant

Continued From Page >)
then I decided it wasn't...

“Since the only building large
enough for the painting will be
be the new library. if it has
enough space for it. I've given
the Union a choice of this pain-
ting when it's finished or one of
the medium ones.

“IT don't think of painting in
terms of background and
foreground. It’s all the surface
of the canvas. I treat it in the
same manner. It doesn't get

tedious working on
‘background’.

“Well. I can remember
working on some im-

pressionistic landscapes when I
first started to paint. some of
that, mountains and things like
that got tedious.

“I did my first painting when
I was 12, though I didn’t think of
painting as a profession until 1
was a freshman here.

[started from there to whole
figure studies in rooms and then
I dropped the figures and kept
painting rooms. Sometimes I'd
add stilllifte. like a vase or
something.”

Ken gets up and walks across
the studio. Retreating to a cor-
ner, he begins to unearth can-
vases with “freed 71" or “freed
72” painted on the back. This
activity is interrupted by the
arrival of the long-awaited can-
vas for his triptych

His paintings are mostly
acrylic, although one that he
shows is oil. The majority of his
paintings have an_ incredible
amount of lumps whose texture
no amount of paint gobs could
account for.

“IT have a tactile quality in my
painting that is very important
to me.’ Ken explains. “‘That."’
indicating the gobs, “is a mix-
ture of sawdust and sand with
the paint. I haven't found a need
to mix anything else with the
acrylic.

“Of course, some paintings
are pretty lavered.” turning
and producing a dynamic pain-
ting of pinks ranging from pur-
plish to orange. “This one has
about 21 lavers, and somewhere
under that I think might be a
painting I did my freshman
year.

“IT have maybe two of my
freshman paintings. The rest
were sold at art shows.”

He smiles. “I was a
psychology major my freshman
year, but it didn't take long to
kill that...Of course. I'd been

painting much longer than I'd

been interested in psychology

“IT have a brother who's
coming here next vear as a
freshman, and = he’s” a
psychology major.”

Ken carefully stows away the
canvases.
