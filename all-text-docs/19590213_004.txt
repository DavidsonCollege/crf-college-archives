Davidson Claims Rich

By BOB BRADFORD

William Lee Davidson gave much of his life to. the founding of a college in
Mecklenburg based on Presbyterian principles. His father had fought equally hard
for the Presbyterians’ right to Queens College in Charlotte, but this had failed.
However, the congregations of the Catawba and Yadkin valleys still had hopes
of founding a college.

Harper’s Magazine
Commends Davidson

Davidson College is recommended in the February issue of Harper's Magazine
as a good school for even the most talented high school student.

No student should consider Davidson a ‘second choice” to such “prestige” in-
stitutions as the Ivy League colleges, says an article titled “Good Colleges That

this danger, we must be pre-
pared to mix the student pot
more thoroughly, to encourage
a greater migration of first-
class Eastern students to the
South and Midwest, as replace-
ments for those whom the
prestige schools have siphoned
off.”

In 1820 a group of men met

but the plans never material-

is the connecting link between
Queens College and Davidson.

ROTC Cadets Obtain
Branch Assignments

Seventy-one Davidson ROTC MS IV cadets have re-
ceived their army branch assignments which will become
effective following graduation and their commissioning
as 2nd Lieutenants.

Captain Jobn Mitchell re-
leased figures this week on the
branch assignments for senior
cadets, which were made by the
Department of the Army in
Washington, D. C., following
approval of the applications by
a local board.

Of the seventy-one local
applicants, sixty-nine percent
or forty-nine seniors received
their first choice. Another
eleven per cent of nine ca-
dets were granted their sec-
ond preferred branch.

Eleven men or sixteen per
cent were assigned to their
third selection, and  assign-
ments to a fourth or fifth
choice were made to only two
men.

According to available fig-
ures, a higher percentage of
eadets received their first
branch choice this year than
did last year’s class when ap-
proximately sixty per cent fell
in this category.

Twenty-two cadets. the larg-
est number in any one branch,
will serve in Army Intelligence,
while twenty seniors will con-
centrate their active duty in

and 200 acres respectively.

The _ financial committee
raised an impressive $30.392 to
begin the college. Plans were

cation of each building, and

students make the work more

cadets will report should be
received before March 1. Un-
der Present anticipated policy,
all cadets assigned to Intelli-
gence and Security will be or-
dered to active duty for two
years. Other branches will vary
according to the needs of the
service and the  individual’s
preference,” Capt. Mitchell ex-
plained. |
