rean War, emphasis was placed in
the correction of the bad habits of
waste and carelessness by training
in supply economy. Korea gave evi-
4 dence of how this training was ef-
fective in a decrease in unnecessary

loss of material. °

The supply economy and cost
conscious training is now part of
the program of instruction for
ROTC units. The objective of the
training is the development of a
sense of cost-consciousness in the
cadet. He is taught to realize that
supply discipline is in reality a
command responsibility. Supply dis-
cipline is achieved through proper
application of leadership techniques

and is an important phase of small
unit training.

The training covers the entire
four years of the ROTC course. It
begins in MS I, stressing the in-
dividual’s responsibility for his own
equipment and develops into the
command responsibility phase in
MS IV.

’

Today, the Army places much
importance on an officer's econom-
ieat use of supplies and equipment
under his control. The officer's ef-
ficiency report contains a section
where entries are made relative to
his efficiency in supply economy.

plenty of trouble.

Dick McKee. who took Derrick Barton’s place as tennis
coach, hasn't been losing any time either. He’s already got an
off-season match lined up with P.C. and is working to arrange
several more this fall. Although he lost Allan Strand and Dewey
Keesler, Coach McKee still has a formidable crew on hand.
