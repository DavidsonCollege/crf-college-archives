HERE’S A WARNING

from past experience of dance week-
ends, the Pan-Hellenic Council has dis-
covered that at least one car has been
broken into and has been relieved of
Wraps, at every set that there is
any record concerning. This year’s Pan-
Hellenic Council is: seeking extra police
protection ,for the-ears parked in the
area, but car-owners are cautioned to
no valuables in the car while it
is parked outside the armory, and: stu-
dents are urged to carry these instruce-
tions to visitors who bring their cars.

Sometimes it has been known. that
windows are broken when nothing of
value, apparently, had been left in the
car. So to remedy any fear of windows
heing broken, we suggest that all the
doors be left unlocked and all wraps and
other valuables be taken inside the arm-
ory, whether they are checked at the desk
left on the shairs behind the decora-

tions. This, of course is only a sugges-
tion, and if it seems wiser for you to
leave wraps in the cars, we can only

hope you are not as unfortunate as some
have been in the past.

... V— FOR “30”

“V"" for Victory has fast become the
universal and popular symbol for the Al-
lies’s cause, so certain college and other
newspapers have begun substituting the
three dots;-a “Ve, and a dash tor ‘their
conventional “30" which signifies the
ending of a news story. The Davidson-
ian is adopting the symbol.

... V—
CONSERVE THAT TIME!

When war times come, the ordinary
course of life automatically changes to
fit the demands of the nation, and it is
quite natural that it does so. Time,
(time for doing things other than sleep-
ing, exercising, and the rest of the nor-
mal everyday activities) becomes short-
er. There are more Hines to do, evén
in a college community like Davidson.

The things that once seemed very im-
portant are made secondary’ by activities
entered into by everybody. for the com-
mon good: of all. 4

At Davidson, we see certain organiza-
tions right-now slipping into a state of
complacency; these organizations were
previously active and were really i por-
tant to a great number of persons. Yet,
now, they slump into. this indolent state
that, separates the really worthwhile or-
ganizations from the ones that are act-
ually unnecessary and relatively unim-
portant for the well- -being and broaden-
ing of Davidson men.

From The Inside

We refer to the honorary fraterni-
ties. The time seems ripe to utterly
erase the existence of certain organiza-
tions from Davidson life. Those non-
functioning bodies of disinterested mem-
bers really. would appreciate same excuse
for disbandment.

One member of an organization has
recently admitted that he was so wronged
by being asked to join the group that
he now wishes he had his two dollars in
his bill fold and that the literature

wouldn't litter up his post office box
any longer. Another chapter charges
five dollars per year for an occasional
get-together that amounts merely to a
social chat that somewhere along the line,
sometimes, catches a glimmering of the
organization’s function as a sideline in
the conversation,

Perhaps names ought to be mentioned.
We sometimes wonder if the members of
Ita Sigma Phi know who they are them-
selves. With all due respect for the
good that might-and should be gotten
out of a classical fraternity, and the
recognition they received for their ex-
cellence in the fields of Latin and Greek,
we also wonder whether their knowledge
of these two subjects has been to a great
degree aided or stimulated by their four
meetings which have t taken pl: ice during
the first semester,

“Too Many Broths.. .”

Another argument against the mass
of these associations is that the fact of
their number tends to make the ones that
actually accomplish something: seem less
glorious in their achievement and the
name of their organization is lost in the
maze of Greek letters that float carelessly
ifiithe list of activities of some of our
more prominent students.

And what can the individual do to rid
the place of the evils of two much organ-
ization? Tf you belong to two honorar iy.
fraternities which are supposed to be
active, and you find that you get little
or nothing out of either, simply drop
one and make the one you consider the
more worthwhile, actually worthwhile.
When time becomes such an important
factor, we'll have to use it to the best
of our advantage,

Y’s Corner

By SHAW SMITH

Now that exams are over and we have had
time to celebrate that joyful occasion, we can
get back into. the full swing of college life

and begin to think once again about some of the
basic things here at Davidson besides the books.

Just Case you haven't. already guessed it,
I'm talking about the hall meetings on Wednesday
night. It seems that most of us forgot all about
during the rush and drive of
though most of ‘us believe. that we
need prayer even more at a time like that. Anyway,
that water is already under the bridge, and
want to begin thinking about our

plans for the hall meetings during this semester.

What we hope everyone will*realize is that
these are voluntary meetings,“organized and run
wholly by students for the good of the student
body. -In— other—-words, these-are. our meetings
and it is entirely up to us to make them what
we want them to be. I'm sure that we will all
agree that the boys on a hall ought to be drawn
close together, and that some bull sessions are

really helpful while others are merely a waste
of time. These are the two convictions we want to
on.

All

at least

the boys on a hall need to get together
once a’ week, and they could come to-

gether for no better purpose than to discuss their

mutual problems and convictions along the more:

serious and religious lines. So, if you don't enjoy

going to the meeting on your hall and if you
don’t get anything out of it, maybe it’s your
own fault. You know, we can’t expect to get

much out of anything unless we put something
into it. How many times have you led the meet-
