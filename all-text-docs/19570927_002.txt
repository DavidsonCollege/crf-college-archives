Ike Drives Another Nail
In Coffin Of States’ Rights

It. is unfortunate that the integra-
tion problem has overshadowed the
real question in the current Little
Rock public school problem.

The argument in Arkansas has not
been whether or not there shall be
mixed schools. Integration is already
a fact. in some parts of the State.

The real issue, however. is State
versus Federal authority

We are engaged in a Constitutional
crisis.

Fundamental Question Faced

The United States are faced with
the fundamental question of what
powers belong to the national govern:
ment. and what powers are reserved to
the State governments.

Simply. who has jurisdiction over
the public schools of Arkansas. and
more specifically, who is responsible
for the safety, welfare. and protec-
tion of the people who attend those
schools.

Historically, the several states have
jurisdiction over the public schools.
Even the present Supreme Court ad-
mitted this when it declared, “Today,
education is perhaps the most impor-
tant function of State and local gov-
ernments.”

Moreover, the States have always
been the legal guardians over the safe-
ty of its people. The right to maintain
a State police force is fundamental.

But now we see these rights being —

crushed bv the most powerful mili-
tary force in the world—the United
States Army.

Ike Broke Faith

By sending federal troops into
Arkansas, President Eisenhower has
brokeri faith with the spirit and mean-
ing of the Constitution of the. United
States.

Perhaps Mr. Eisenhower doesn’t
really understand the American sys-
tem of dual powers.

Perhaps he doesn’t know that the
Constitution was conceived so that
both the States and the national gov-
ernment would have sovereignty over

particular governmental functions.
One of these State functions is the

right to run the public schools and to

preserve good order in the States.

But now Mr. Eisenhower has de-
nied-the State of Arkansas the right to
handle its own affairs. He has pre-
vented a State from performing one
of its natural functions.

Arkansas Now Heipless

Therefore Arkansas stands help-
less with its State militia nationalized
and its right to manage its own affairs
seriously limited.

Eisenhower's action in Arkansas
may be explained by the fact that the
President is a former Army general.
He is now doing at the point of.a bayo-
net what he was unable to do through
erdinary political channels.

Perhaps the man from Abileen is
impatient with constitutional pro-
cesses. Instead, he prefers the much
quicker method of guns and bullets—
the art he knows best.

And so we have now reached the
point where we must determine just
what kind of political system we are
going to have in this country. Does a
State any longer have the right to
handle its own affairs? Must a State
first get Federal approval before it
can use its own methods in meeting
violence and disorder?

Who Runs A Stote

In short. who is going to run the
State of Arkansas? Will it be the gov-
ernment of Arkansas. or the govern-
ment of the United States?

Unless statesmanship soon over-
takes political expediency, this gen-

eration of Americans may be wit-

nesses to destruction of the American
Republic as we have understood it.

Unless the power-hungry and vote-
conscious mén in Washington come to
their senses. Arkansas, as well as New
York, North Dakota, and Kansas, will
soon be mere geographical districts
within an all-powerful and centralized
dictatorship.

Fraternity System Means
Freedom Of Association

Tomorrow afternoon's pledging of
fraternities will mark the formal end.
of this year’s rushing.

For some. Rush Week has: been a
disappointment. For others it has
been a week of limited triumph. For
all it has been a week of vital import-

ce.

” The tragedy of Rush Week lies in
the fact. that not everyone is 100%
satisfied when it is over. Some boys
will not get any bids. Others will be
invited to join a fraternity but not
the one they are most interested in.

Yet. still others will have their pick
of several. And even more ironical,
many fraternities will not get some of
the boys that they want most.

Despite its many flaws. Rush
Week is necessary, and the fraternity
system is a good system. Every frater-
nity at Davidson has something good
to offer. All, to some extent, meet the
needs and desires of those who belong
in them.

We have now arrived at the hour
of decision. Now is the time for both
the fraternities and the freshmen, in-
dividually and as a group, to think
clearly and correctly.

But even with meditative thought,
mistakes will be made. We pass on to
you, the freshmen, this now familiar

word. One weck is too short to judge
a bov. and for a bov to judge a fra-
ternitv. There is no perfect answer to
this fault. but perhaps deferred. or
second semestcr Rushing would be a
partial remedy.

Through it all. one important fact
remains. The fraternity svstem is a
particalar type of system. It is a sys-
tem of “voluntary association.”

Ultimately, the fraternity system
is the system of freedom of choice.
And the choice works from two sides
—you and the fraternities.

Who's The Poet?

Schoo! spirit is an intangible that
we like to talk about.

The present freshman class has
been demonstrating the best spirit of
any class of the past few years. Even
the upperclassmen seem to be amazed
at the “esprit de corps” of the Class
of ’61.

It is refreshing to see a new group
on campus prove to sophisticated col-
lege students that it isn’t immature to
yell for the team.

And by the way, who's the poet in
the freshman class!

PARENTS OF FRESHMEN

Your Son Needs Help In Adjusting To College

(Ed. Note: The following is
an excerpt from the Oct. 4, 1956
issue of the Princeton Alumni
Weekly. Mr. Chase is an expert
in the field of personal coun-
seling.)

By HAROLO M. CHASE

In American folklore,  col-
. lege days—all of them—are de-
lightfully carefree and happy.

In actual fact this is nonsense
—or so I’ have been led to be-
lieve on the basis of my ex-
perience advising college fresh-
men.

Whatever the reason. most
parents just do not appreciate
what their youngsters are go-
ing through their freshman

year and afford them little aid

and comfort. A good portion of

the parents aggravate the dif-
ficulties.

Self-Reappraisal

Freshman year for most
young men is a time of agoniz-
ing self-reappraisal. Big frogs
in small ponds usually become
smaller frogs in bigger ponds.

three years. is dead. Gone ajso
are the slashing editorials and
chapel rebuttals which it in-
Spired.

For the neophytes, the Peden
Amendment was a somewhat
hastily conceived resolution to
radically reform election pro:
cedures. It called for open cam-
paigning and limited politick-
ing in general.

Tedious Elections

At present, student elections
are a rather tedious process of
elimination which takes the
better part of the spring to
complete. They are unimagina-
tive and overall pretty boring.
After the first month or so of

it candidates are elected by a

majority of considerably

only exciting piece of legisla-

than fifty ner cent of those eligi-

ble to vote.

Speculation has it that the
present system came in on the
wave of reaction to Bismarck

was about three quarters of a

significance in calling to mind

and Realpolitik. This of course

century ago which only has

how old Davidson is.

Stimulate Interest

It seems obvious to point out
that an election system is need-
ed which would provide for a
little excitement to stimulate in-
terest in who is being elected
(outside the candidates’  fra-
ternity.)

The student council can make
their little mark in Davidson
history by effectively reshaping
election procedures. Balloting
in the Union; limiting cam-
paigning—-such as debates by
candidates on crucial issues
(should any arise) trimming the
length of elections. These are
possibilities to be considered.

Action Needed

Now, however, is the time to

work on it. The ill-fated Peden
amendment was a makeshift
resolution in the right direction
— even though it may have
been too far in the right di-
rection:
* With plenty of time in the
school year before spring elec-
tions, perhaps a comprehensive
system can be conceived where
it should be originated: our
student council.

boy is in secondary school, he
is generally going to be less
distinguished in college. Of
course, the exceptionally gift-
ed or those who mature late
may go on to greater heights
and become bigger frogs than
they were in school.

Obviously, most college fresh-
men cannot hope to achieve the
honors and positions they won
in school. Here is the rub. The
young man, flushed with suc-
cess in secondary school and
spurred on by proud, ambi-
tious and well-meaning parents,
sets aspiration levels beyond
his abilities. And, when achieve-
ment is substantially below
aspiration, frustration results.

Take John L for
example. John had been the
number one man in his class in
a large high school in a big
city.

The term started. He worked
hard. At the first marking
period he had a third group
average, a good averag2 and
sufficiently high, to maintain
his scholarship at Princeton.
John was shocked.

He felt that he had done his
best and, as a matter of fact,
he had. Yet here he was far
below the top of his class.

His disappointment in him-
self was sharpened by concern
that he had let his parents
déwn. He literally became so
ashamed that he did not go
home during the first vacation
period.

Gradually he became more
and more despondent and in-
effectual in his work. If this
was the best he could do when
he was giving it all he had,
what was the use of trying? His
average dropped; he lost his
scholarship and had to leave
college.

Week's Chatter

By PHIL LEWIS

As this is Rush Week, and it is difficult to talk
to anyone about anything but Rushing, this week’s
column is in the form of remarks overheard in pass-
ing from place to place on campus. It is our intent to
make this an outlet for informal trivia including
names and events which go to make up the interest-
ing, but undramatic, side of campus life.

“Young man, this is Philosophy 31.” “Oh! Ex-
cuse me! I was sure this was English 11.”

‘But that court had no right to make that de-
cision in the first place. Before long all individual

rights will be gone.”

“He told me tonight that he had definitely de-
cided to go Alpha Beta or Zeta Eta Theta.” “I sure
hope he makes a good Zeta Eta. Ball!!”

“How long has he been on that phone? I’ve got
to call my girl again tonight. and if he doesn’t hurry.
I'm going to take it away from him.” .

“It sure is good to meet you Jim. Oh. I'm sorry:
Bill. Have you seen the scrapbook? We really have
a nice one Id like you to see.”

“Hey'!! What's Doc White doing out on the

field?”

“Now men, I know that vou’re going to be a
little busy this week, so the review on Saturday will
cover only the first hundred pages of parallel and

the Book of Genesis.”

“I know they have all that, but did you notice
the way they cut each other down, even- while we
were there. I'm still going Alpha Beta.”

“When in doubt...”

Praises Speech
Dear ‘Editor:

e

In chapel Tuesday two state-
ments were made, which,. it
seems to me, express our state
more ably than could have been
done through much effort on
the part of many of our more
seasoned Ivy - league coffee-
break philosophers.

I commend Mr. Chapin for his
frankness and insight in point-
ing out that we as Davidsonians
must ask ourgelves whetber or
not our own growth as, men has
kept up with that of our phy-
sical surroundings. Ironically
enough, a Davidsonian, over-
heard in the audience, made
mumbled reply: “Maybe we
don’t want to make that kind
of progress”.

It is essential that we preach
of living up to high ideals and
measuring up to noble prece-
dents, even of building a more
noble future. But how can we
speak in the language of
“ideals” when the very word
has lost its meaning? How can
a man care what is “right” or
“wrong” or “better” or “worse”
when the scale of values is de-
gree of personal pleasure?

Yours,
S. C. PATTERSON

1 could to help John, what he
needed most was help from
understanding parents.

Tam sure a parent’s reaction
at this point is that he would
never be guilty of pushing his
son beyond his capacity, that he
expects o lot of his son only
because the boy is exceptional.
ly able.

But remember most of us
have a tendency to overestimate
the abilities of our offspring,
a very human failing. So if
Junior is not doing as well as
his father had expected, per-
haps he is expecting too much.

It is equally impossible for
the 103 secondary* school edi-
tors-in-chief to head the college
newspaper. To an adult it
may seem a little absurd that
the failure to make the foot-
ball team can be a really shat-.
tering experience. But remem.”
ber a seventeen-year-old is not
an adult. His values are not the
values of a mature adult.

Why Not Try Pre-Med?

Preserve me from the parents’
(usually papa but sometimes a
domineering mother) who are
determined that their son shall
be an engineer or doctor irre.
spective of whether or not
their son has the interest or
aptitude for it.

I’ve seen it happen so often
that I now feel that it is axio.
matic that if a student is not
really interested in his work
the going will be rough.

What can parents do to help
their young man in his fresh-
man year? I must confess that
I have no pat answer for all
problems and for all individ.
uals, but here are a few sug-
gestions I would like to pass
on:

1. At the earliest convenient
time, see your freshman's fac-
ulty adviser. Parents can tell
an adviser a great deal about
his advisee which helps in un._
derstanding and advising him.
By the same token, the adviser
can tell the parents much that
will help them to help their
son. ~

2. Before their son leaves
home and after, parents should
make an effort to discuss the
‘problems that may come up in
college. It can be a great help
and comfort to be forewarned.
and intelligent discussions with
his parents gives a youngster
a chance to reflect on some of
the obstacles he will face so
that he is not taken by them
unaware.

3. Parents, particutarly
fathers, should refrain from
heaping pious platitudes on the
heads of their sons when they
are home for vacations. [In my
experience, mothers tend to be
much more sympathetic and
understanding with sons. Dad
always seems to find it hard
to believe that Junior is work-
ing as hard as he should. Ton
often fathers are inordinately
ambitious for their sons. and
project all. their own dreams of _
success and fears of failure
onto the next generation.

The son wants real under.
standing and discussion of his.
problems. not a litany of “genins
is 90°: perspiration,” “a good
man will always come out on
top,” etc,

lf this is all Dad gives him.
the son will turn to other peo-
ple for help. Yet no one ean
really take the place of an ua-
derstanding and devoted father.

“On the other hand it’s good to have a student like Worthal,
