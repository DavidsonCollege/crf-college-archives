Blockbuster's newest location on Highway 73 West.

Now the Davidson commu-
nity has another option in video
rental—Blockbuster Video.
The popular chain of video

‘stores, based in Spartanburg, South

Carolina, has a new location in
Cornelius.

The store, scheduled to open
this past Friday, is located on High-
way 73 at Exit 28 adjacent to Burger
King.

The new Blockbuster store is
part of amini-shopping center that
will also include a Bi-Lo foodstore
and a Mexican restaurant, El
Cancun. Bi-Lo will be competing
against two other chain foodstores

already located at Exit 28—Harris
Teeter and Food Lion.

Rental membership at Block-
buster is free if you have a major
credit card and driver’s license.
Without a credit card, there is a $3
processing fee. Videos, rented for
three nights, are $2.50 or $3.50
each.

Senior Margo Tootle says that
“T will probably still go to Cathy’s
Video because it is near the other
stores. where I shop.”

Junior Li Lin Lee remarked
that “there are enough stores close
by to rent movies—Cathy’s, Gal-
axy, and Carolina Cones.” Don’t
forget the Union.

“Hopefully there will be more
options for movies, especially clas-
sics which stores around here don’t
have,” commented senior Susan
Wildey. When told that El Cancun
would be part of the new shopping
center, she smirked, “Finally we
don’t have to drive to Charlotte for
real Mexican food. Taco Bell is
not Mexican food.”

With this new retail develop-
ment comes increased concerns
about traffic congestion at Exit 28.
Shad Spencer of Cornelius Ad-
ministration and Planning says that
the State of North Carolinais plan-
ning to widen sections of Highway
73:

Journey to the Khyber Frontier for all you can eat Indian cuisine

By Lillian Roe

Are you looking for some-
thing different todo? Are you tired
of eating the same old bland food
every night? Do you feel cultur-
ally deprived? If your answer to
one or more of these questions is
yes, there is no need to worry any
longer. There is now a solution to
your problem: the Khyber Fron-
tier.

The Khyber Frontier is the
newest Indian restaurant in Char-
lotte. Some of you may have been

familiar with Chicken Delight, the
small Indian take-out on Monroe.
Chicken Delight has now closed,
and the former owner has opened
the Khyber Frontier just a few
blocks down from the old Chicken
Delight. Now, the restaurant is
even better.
Khyber Frontier is both a sit-
down and take-out restaurant, but I
strongly recommend eating in and
spending an hour or more at this
great place. Not only is the restau-
rant ar but is also a cul-

tural experience. The walls are
decorated in Indian art, you will
hear Hindi music coming form the
kitchen, many people will be eat-
ing with their fingers, and you will
probably even catch a glimpse of
the owner, who is also the head
chef, in his turban as you leave.
And still, these are not even the
best parts!

The food, which is what you
came for, is excellent. It is all
authentic Indian and absolutely
delicious. The menu is filled with

options from various breads, rice,
vegetable dishes, and meat dishes.
Every Wednesday and Sunday
night there is an all vegetarian, all
you can eat buffet with ten differ-
ent dishes and there is a buffet
every day for lunch.

Sounds expensive? Notatall.
The dinner buffet is $6.30, and the
lunch buffet is $4.00. A la carte
dinners are comparable in price for
a full meal. At good Indian restau-
rants, a meal normally. runs $10-
$15, so the Khyber Frontier price
is a steal.

As you enter the restaurant
you will read, "Please don't look

for a quick fix, there are a lot of
others doing that. You have been
eating at a whole lot of places;
come dine with us like Maharada.
You are not less than Maharada in
my eyes. Please leave the follow-
ing things outside and come in to
enjoy: hurries, worries, appoint-
ments, commitments, engage-
ments, and off-moods. Even think-
ing about smoking or drinking is
not allowed."

If you are interested, the res-
taurant is on Monroe Road. Treat
yourself to something new at the
Khyber Frontier. The food is so
good, it's easy to eat too much!

Mail order country music

Dwight continued from page 11:

album, is a predominantly acous-
tic ballad. This is a new kind of
tune for the “King of Rockabilly,”
and he handles it with ease and
grace.

If you’re a big fan, go ahead
and buy the album. Otherwise,

come on by and I'll let you tape
these five (just don’t tell the copy-
writers). They’re certainly worth
hearing. What can I say? Ilovehis
music, but this new one falls short.
Don’t blame Dwight, though.
Don’t even blame Texas. It’s all
Sharon’s fault, and I have no doubt
he’ ll recover.
