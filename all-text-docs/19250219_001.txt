The subject of Social Hygiene was de-
veloped before the student body by Dr. |
Swan, of New York City, Thursday and

Friday of the past week. Dr. Swan spoke
at Davidson under the auspices of the Y. M.
C, A, and interestingly and effectively pre-
sented his subject to the students who heard
him in chapel and at a special lecture in the
gymn Friday evening. This lecture was
given in connection with a film) showing
graphically the theme of Dr. Swan's talk.
Social Hygiene is a subject so much over-
done on the lecture platform that the mere
mention of it as a topic for discussion in- |
stantly brings to the mind associations of
hackneyed and unpleasant phrases. But the
talks of Dr, Swan were presented in a dif-|
ferent way. Instead of giving the hearers al
long table of “Don'ts,” he gave them a few |
vital “Do's” that carried in themselves prom- |
ises of happiness in the life that is to come |
after college. As he himself stated, his ob-
ject was to treat the subject of love andl
marriage not in any sentimental sort of a
way but to approach it from a philosophical
standpoint. The high points of his lectures
came in his plea for boys and men to be
sympathetic toward their sweethearts or
wives, and to try to understand them in all
they do, and above all to consider their views
in any matter as being important.
Connected with the topic.of Social Hygiene
is the problem of evolution and reproduction
in the animal world. Dr. Swan touched upon |
this subject frequently, and the picture
shown Friday evening was devoted entirely
toward giving the students a better idea and
a clearer conception of the fundamentals of |
animal reproduction, As Dr. Swan described |
the film, it is the most, wonderful picture of
its kind in existence, much of it being taken |

Makes a Hit in Belmont |

This is the First of a of a Series of Nice |
Trips Which Will be Taken
Shortly

The Davidson Glee Club gave one of the |
most successful performances of the season |
last Friday night at Belmont.

The chorus was encored time after time}
and the soloists also proved very popular.

Tom Barr, taking the place of Fitts in tall
Wildcat Four, proved to be a capable bass. |
This popular quartet has proven one of the,
drawing cards of the Glee Club this year.

The trip to and from Belmont was made |
by automobile, and return was made Friday
night.

This Saturday night the Glee Club will
give a performance at Queens College, under
the auspices of the Senior class there, It is
understood that the girls are preparing an
elaborate entertainment in their honor,

Several other trips will be made in the
near future. On the night of the 28th a con-
cert will be given at Huntersville. On/!
March 11 another will be given in Lexing-
ton and on the 14th they will appear before
Mitchell College, at Statesville. Negotiations |
are now under way for concerts at Greens- |
boro, High Point, Winston-Salem or Salis- |
bury for the ni nights of tke 12th and 13th.

The Glee Clib‘Waa a’ very successful fall |
season, and if present plans carry through |

rian Mission in INétlen, brought the students |

a message from the foreign field, telling in
particular of the great call to service there.
The religious attitude of the native and his
response to the teachings of Christianity,
formed a striking part of the discourse.

Mr. Craig first said that it seemed strange
| that he should have come before the men of
Davidson five years ago to tell of his ex-
| periences in Siberia, the coldest part of th
worldjand that now he should come to tell
{them of the Belgian Congo, the hottest place
funder the sun.

He divided the people opposed to work in

foreign missions into two classes, “The first,

those ignorant of the frightful conditions in ,

| heathen lands; and second, those knowing the

facts but too selfish to the call.”

Taking as the keynote of his message the
passage from Mark four of “Behold there
went out a sower to sow,” Mr. Craig. said
that

answer

“to the sower when he goes out to sow |

there comes two questions that demand an- |

swer; the first of them, Is there a demand
for this crop? and the second, Will the fruit
be worth the labor?” Now applying these
questions to the field of foreign service: “Is
there a demand?” does the heathen live in

need of the brand of religion that the Prot-
lestant faith can bring him?”

He showed
very conclusively how each should be an-
,swered “Yes.”

The vesper service was marked by en-

by Wilbur Hodgkin at the piano. Norman
