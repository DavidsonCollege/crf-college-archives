NUMBER 6

After two
year hiatus,
Chambers
bells toll

once again

By Russ Tarver

“When I was a freshman, I
liked listening to the Chambers
bell ringing along with the DCPC
bells. It was the neatest sound ...
and then one day, the Chambers
bell just stopped,” says senior Anna
Gray Anderson. “I’m glad to be
hearing it again.” : ,
She is not the only one happy.
Administrative Assistant to Presi-
dent Kuykendall Denise Howard
~ explains, “One day we received a
letter from a group of students who
wanted to konw why the bell had

stopped ringing.” This letter

spawned action.

Howard says the bell broke
and no one bothered to repair it
“for two and a half years.” The
Davidson Physical Plant finally
made repairs to the bell last week.

Sophomore Trey Gilbert ex-
presses acommon student opinon:
“Tt’s nice because professors and
students definitely know when
class is over, but it’s really annoy-
ing when you’re trying to sleep
late during the week.”

Junior Chris Mann agrees: “If
it rang every hour on the hour, it
would be tolerable, but four times
an hour is’ annoying and
unecessary.”

Despite these minor criticisms,
members of the Davidson College
community are excited to restart a
well-liked and, according to some
students, somewhat necessary tra-
dition.

From the Associated Press to
’ Bulgaria, Perry finished his career
with his final post:
as Director of Davidson's
Dean Rusk Program.

By Beth Lindsey

Jack Perry, the founder and -

director of the Dean Rusk pro-
gram, has officially announced
his decision to retire at the end of
this year, ending a decade of ser-
vice to the international studies
programs at Davidson.
Scheduled to step down on
July 1, 1995, Perry cites several
reasons for his retirement.
‘Turning 65 this March, Perry
says this is “‘a traditional time to
think about retirement.”
Having come to Davidson in
the summer of 1985, Perry will
have worked in this position for
ten years. He strongly feels that
the Dean Rusk Program needs
“new blood” to encourage new
ideas which are appealing to the
everchanging opinions and inter-
ests of Davidson students. Perry
says, “In order for the program to
move on to a new plateau, the
program benefits from a new di-
rector.” :
’ Why Davidson?
Ten years ago, Atlantd-area

‘} alumni of Davison started a cam-

paign to raise funds for support of
Davidson. At the same time a
search was begun at the college
to improve international pro-
grams. Perry was then finishing
a five-year teaching job at The

1

Citadel. Political Science Profes-
sor Louis Ortmayer says, “The
fund-raising efforts were going ex-
ceedingly well, and the amount of
money being raised just seemed to
fit the international studies pro-
gram that we wanted to begin.”
Thus, the search for a director of
the program was begun and Perry
was asked to fill the position.
What facets of the Dean Rusk
program would Perry like to
see continue?

Between $30,000 and $45,000
in any given year is given to stu-
dents for international studies’ pro-
grams. Perry feels stongly about
the commitment Davidson has
made to establishing a resource
where “individual students can
come, express an interest, and go
there.” He would like to see the
international program “become
even more international” as it con-
tinues to grow. :

_ He would also like to see the
Student Advisory Committee con-
tinue to blossom. SAC is an stu-
dent-run organization who meet to
discuss projects they wish to en-
gage in concerning international
issues including the Toilet Paper
newsletters, Africa Week, and In-
ternational Jeopardy. Perry says
that this is one area in which “stu-
dents visibly decide the content of

Faculty opposed to students
on trustee committees

By Meg Wolff

“It’s unfortunate that the fac-
ulty won’t support us in this en-
deavor,” says SGA President Eric
Rosenbach.

According to Rosenbach, the
Vice-President pro tempore of the
faculty, Dr. Robert Manning, op-
poses an SGA resolution to place
students on trustee committees. He
refused to comment.

In Rosenbach’s view, Man-
ning, as the “speaking voice” of
the faculty, opposes the resolution
because “he feels that the influ-
ence of the faculty with the trust-
ees would be diluted if students
were to be admitted to the commit-

The faculty have been allowed
to sit on the trustee committees for
the lastthree years. Rosenbach has
received positive feedback from
the Dean of the Faculty, Dr. Robert
Williams, whom Rosenbach be-
lieves supports the resolution and
considers it a student/trustee issue.

Rosenbach cites Duke;
Wesleyan, and Brown as success-
ful examples of schools where stu-
dents not only sit on trustee com-
mittees, but also are trustees.

Rosenbach’s next step will be
to speak in favor of the resolution

tees.

the Dean Rusk Program,” and that
is the main focus of the program—
an organization for the students.
When asked about challenges
facing his successor and the Dean
Rusk Program as a whole, Perry
first notes the progress that has
been made, He’s very happy to be
able to say that about fifty percent
of any given class has participated
in a study abroad program.
What have been some of the
difficulties of his position?
Perry cannot help but look
back to the goal which he estab-
lished with President Kuykendall
ten years ago—the ambition “to
touch every student with a vision
of the world.” In the context of a
very inward-looking country, Perry
has continually struggled to touch

every graduate with an increased
international awareness.

Says Perry, “True awareness
includes a changed mindset—in
effect, the changing of students’
lives which doesn’t necessitate
leaving the country” but does ne-

cessitate removing oneself from
his or her comfort zone to unex-

plored territory. Its success ulti-
mately depends on the commit-
ments of both the college and |
individual students to interna-
tional studies.

Faced with this challenge,
Perry truly hopes the new direc-
tor will have some great ideas
“that really reach out and touch a
greater number of students’
