Vagabonds To Present
““St. Joan” This Week

Spurred by their initial success, “The Mad Woman of Chaillot,’ the Vaga-
bonds are planning their second performance, “St. Joan’ by G. B. Shaw for next

Wednesday at 8:15. Following the precedent set in their first play, the new dram a
group will disregard traditional stage settings, and give the play on the front

steps of Chambers.

The cast of “St, Joan” demon-
strates the excellent student-
faculty-community co-operation
achieved by the Vagabonds. It
includes President D. G. Mar-
tin, Dean F. W. Johnston, and
five other members of the fac-
ulty. Mrs. D. G. Martin plays
the leading role.

Crowded Quarters
Cause Office Shift

The Office of Admissions and
Financial Aid moved this week
to rooms immediately north of
the lobby of Chambers Build-
ing. The shift was made be-
cause of the need for more
space for handling admissions.

Mr. H. E. White, Associate
Director of Admissions and Di-
rector of Financial Aid, said
that the move was due primar-
ily to the great increase in the
number of applications in re-
cent years and the need for
more room resulting from this.

The new office has much
more waiting and filing room
in a more spacious and com-
fortable atmosphere, so that
admissions may be handled sep-
erately.

Dean White is no longer re-
sponsible for the absence re-
cords which remain under the
Office of the Dean of Students.

Professor W. /W. Burley of
the Guidance Department is
now in charge of the absence
records in the Dean of Stud-
ents’ Office. Absence records
may be inspected between 10:00
and 10:50 a.m. on Wednesdays
and Fridays, and on Thursday
from 2:00 to 3:00 p. m.

In an anteroom of the Colis-

answered our questions.

“Heavens, no! Why I make
most of my own things, any-
way. I'm not able to fly to
Paris for every showing, like
some filthy rich people I know.

“Oh, don’t get me wreng.
I'm not criticizing anybody.
Like Dick says, if you can‘t
say something NICE about
people, just don’t say any-
thing at all.”

From the packed hall, the
speaker’s voice could be heard:
“It's not HIS ,money he'll be
spending! It’s YOUR money!”
A great roar shook the Colis-
eum.

“No, we scarcely know them.
They're high society, and they
don’t associate much with reg-

At its Monday night meeting
the IFC discussed the changes
of the proposal for more than
two hours. The weekly five
hour time limit that any frat-
ernity may require of a pledge,
the prohibition of required stud
running, forced eating, and
calisthenics, and required
pledge attendance at the intra-
mural athletic events were the
major topics of debate.

The revised proposal passed
the council by more than a two-
thirds majority and was return-

ed to the fraternities to see
which parts of the proposal
meet the unanimous consent of
the fraternities.

The first revision of the IFC
pledge training regulations
reads as follows:

1, Pledge shall not be treat-
ed in any manner not in keep-
ing with the level of maturity
supposedly attained by any col-
lege student.

This shall be taken to prohib-
it not only actual hazing and
harassment of pledges, but al-
so such practices as organized

The Council also took two
steps which are of. particular |
interest and importance to ‘the |

ulty suggesting that a student |
who attends church off-campus |

The Council drafted a petition |
asking that girls from Woman's |
College and Queens be given
“overnight privileges” for the
Homecoming Dance weekend.
This petition has already been
presented to Dean Bailey, and
will be sent to the deans of
the girls’ schools.

Shue pointed out that last
week's issue of THE DAVID-
SONIAN did not include a bul-

will be expected also to abide

2. There will be a limit of
five hours per week on the
time any fraternity may require
of a pledge. This limit will not
include time spent on any form-
al-projects such as work at Bar-
ium Springs, at the orthopedic
hospital, Homecoming Decora-
tions, or Skit Night.

The limit will include pledge
meetings and count-offs or call-
downs, but will not include re-

quired . periods: for academic
study,
Also, since it is felt that

pledges will naturally wish and
be expetced to visit brothers in
their rooms, this time will not
be included under the limit so
long as the matter of choosing
the actual times for visitation
is left to the discretion of the
pledge. Further, no time may
be required between the hours
of 10:30 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. the
next day.

3. Freshmen should be = en-
couraged to participate in ex-
tra-curricular activities, though
they cannot be required to do
so. (Under this, for example,
pledges may not be required to
attend intramural athletic
events.) When conflicts in time
arise between fraternity duties
and need for study or partici-
pation in extra-curricular acti-
vities, the latter shall take pre-
cedence over pledge duties.

4. IFC Greek Week regula-
tions will be formulated at a
later date, and will be in keep-
ing with the spirit of the above
regulations. All Greek Week
programs will be approved by
the IFC.

Every effort will be made to
