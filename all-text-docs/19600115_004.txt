Freshman Council president
Alex Morgan. following the
suggestions of the Alumni Asso-
ciation, stated, “All freshmen
were notified of the plans
through hal! meetings.” Roger
Durham is spearheading the
movement.

This new custom will follow
elosely ‘the past and present
tradition of the graduating class
to raise and lower a class flag
during graduation ceremonies.

“The first flag | know of,”
commented Dr. C. G. David-
zon, “was a secession flag
weised over Chambers during
the Civil War, but thet was
back when there was divi-
ston in the student body.”
The College Commencement
Program file, however, dates
the first Senior Class flag be-
tween 1920 and 1922.

“They used to lower the flag,”
reminisced Davidson. “and the
band would play ‘College Ties
Can Ne’er Be Broken’, and
everybody cried. Now they
play the ‘Alma Mater’ but that’s
not much of a tear-jerker.”

‘ “The original _ intention,”

continued Davidson, ‘was to| perhaps too stiff a penalty, thus

Joins College Tradition

This morning in chapel the freshman class adopted a class flag, the beginning
of a new tradition on campus. A vote was taken on a flag proposed by Tom Wright.
If this proposal passed, and the Gallup poll insisted it would, the plans will go to
the Alunini Association, which will present the new flag to the class sometime

The two-manual and. pedal
organ possessing sixteen stops
and dated 1869 was built by
Peter Rosar, a German immi-
grant, at Lancaster, New York.
The rare German organ was
brought to the attention of Dr.
Robert Noehren while he was
‘linstructor.of organ and piano
‘tat Davidson from 1946 to 1949.

Dr. Noehren learned that the
old Rosar organ was standing
in the parish house of St.
John’s Lutheran Church in
Erie, Pennsylvania where ap-
parently it found little use and
had fallen into disrepair.
Noehren, an expert on organ
construction and one of the
country’s leading concert organ-
ists, sensed its value and was
able to buy it for the Davidson
College Music Department.

TEDIOUS TASKS

The task of restoration and
installation in Shearer Hall was
completed in June of 1947. Mr.
Herman Schlicker from  Buf-
falo, New York, was engaged
to restore the organ with the
help of Dr. Noehren and his
students. According to Noehren,
the group spent many hours at
the tedious tasks which are
inevitable in the restoration
of such an instrument. “The
practical experience and knowl-
edge obtained by: the student
helpers have given them an in-
sight into the detalls and ideas
of organ design,” Noechren com-
| mented, °

John T. Ferguson described
the instrument in his article,
“Rare Organ of 1869 Acquired
by Davidson College in North
Carolina” which appeared in
the November 1, 1947 edition
of “The Diapason”. “When as-
sembled, the organ is entirely
unenclosed and stands on a
platform raised six feet above
the auditorium level, so that
the player faces the audience
with his back to the case.”

NO MEAN ABILITY

“It is obvious, upon hearing
the organ, that the builder was
a man of no mean ability and
it is believed the instrument
authentically represents Ger-

Day or some other suspicious

occasion.

Intended to help mold class
spirit and unity, the flag will
also fly at football games and
other athletic events, class
meetings, and class rallies. It
will serve as a tangible symbol
of the class, something to ‘fight
for during the previously  ill-
fated freshman riots against the
upperclassmen.

raise the flag again on the
class’ 25th anniversary reunion,
but they usually jose them.”
The class presidents ordinarily
keep the flags, but at present
there are two in the library,

packed in a ladies’ blouses box.
One of these two flag boxes ‘is
labeled: ‘1928, blue with yellow
léttering, full of holes.” The
other contains a’ 1956 red-on-
white pennant.

Couifcil Assembles
At Semester Break

The Student Council will discuss the possibility of
allowing the return of students dismissed for honor
violations at a meeting scheduled for Friday, January 29.

The faculty recently decided opening the door for Council
that permanent expulsion was consideration.

No officiel ection could be
taken at the Council’s reg-
ular meeting last Monday
night, since a quorum did
not show up. With only seven
members present, the Council
simply discussed matters for
consideration at the schedul-
ed meefing during the
semester break.

man traditions in and bofore
his day. The sound of the organ
belies its size. Many who have
heard it are amazed that it pos-
sesses only sixteen stops. This
ensemble, full, yet clear, gives
the impression that there are
reeds, which is not the case.
There are marked differences
between this organ and Ameri-
can organs of its day and later.
The tracker action is reliable.
The touch is no heavier on
either manual than that of a
grand piano.”

After its installation in
Shearer Hall in June of 1947,
the Rosar organ was put to
many practical tests. “It is prov-
ing to be no mere museum
piece,” Fesperman added in his
article in “The Diapason”. “On
the contrary, all who have
heard or played it have expres-
sed their enthusiasm for its
striking ability to serve as a
thoroughly expressive’ musical
instrument.”

COSTLY RESTORATION

At. present the college has no
suitable space to rebuild the
organ. When Noehren bought
the instrument in 1946 he paid
a nominal sum for it and in-
surance collected for damages
in. transit to Davidson helped
defer the costs of restoration
and installation in Shearer Hall.
It has been estimated that res-
toration today would cost from
five to seven thousand dollars.

It has been suggested that in
the future Oak Row might be
converted into a practice
studio. This would involve re-
moving the partition in the
building and mitering the six-
teen-foot organ pipes to make
them fit into the limited space.
Lingle Chapel has also been
mentioned as a place to install
the instrument.

Negotiations with other col-
leges to fingsa buyer for the
crgan have not been successful.
Professor Noehren, who is now
at the University of Michigan,
is no longer interested in
organs with the tracker action.
The disassembled instrument
will be stored on the second

floor of the old Medical College
Building until college officials
decide its future fate.

Dr. J. H. Ostwalt, for twelve years Davidson’s

the dual role of Director of Student Counseling and
Professor of Education will become effective June 1.

When asked about the
danger of mixing edministra-

teaching, Dr. Ostwalt replied,

but teaching is my primary
interest. At MCV, 1! will heave
to face the inherent problems
of combining the two.”

Bringing in a note of histor-
ical interest, Dr. Ostwalt said

In commenting on his new
position, Dr. Ostwalt said, “I
will be going into a job created
by the Board of Visitors of

and no previous organization.
In addition to a six-hour teach-
ing load, there will be more
administrative work than I've
ever had. ,

demands of the office states
that it will involve directing

Such a position in a graduate

demands different from those

of an undergraduate dean.”

After coming from a similar!
position at Duke in 1948, Dr.
Ostwalt tackled the job of get-

During this time he also car-

Harvard Semester

On January 28, 1960, Dr.
L. B. Schenck will leave with
his wife for a semester sab-
batical, an incorporated
part of the college’s pro-
gram. Having chosen Har-
vard University as his des-
tination, Dr. Schenck will
continue his study in the
field of Theology as a post-
doctorate scholar.

Free to attend any classes
he may have an interest in, Dr.
Schenck indicated his selection
of Biblical Theology with par-
ticular attention to classes of
Dr. Hall Lehmann, Dr. Paul
Tillich, and Dr. George Butt-
rick, the latter in the under-
graduate department.

“My primary area of study,”
said Schenck, “will involve a
follow up in research study in
which I've been interested for
some time.”

Since the publication of his
book in the field of Covenant
Theology, a 1941 Yale Univer-
sity Press edition entitled The
Presbyterian Doctrine of Chil-
dren in’ the Covenant, Dr.
Schenck bas spent two summers
of study in Europe and a sum-
mer of Covenant Theology re-
search in the periodical library
of Union Theological Seminary
in New York. This has afforded
him a fairly constant contact
with the field of Theology in
Europe.

Although his sabbatical ter-
minates with the semester, Dr.
Schenck intends to continue his
study through the summer in-
dependently at the Presbyterian
Historical Library in Montreat,
N. C.
