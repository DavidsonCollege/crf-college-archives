Barry Relates
Court Policy

Earnest Barry, judge of the
Court of Control, stated Wednes-
day his formative plans for the
court this year.

Judge Barry said that he planned
to have the first trial of offenders
on this coming Monday night. He
did not make any statement as to
when he plans to present the guilty
ones before the student body.

The Davidsonian, starting

next Friday, will run each werk
a list of freshmen who have
been brought before the court,
their crimes, and their punish-
ment or guilt. This bulletin will
be in bold face on the back
page of the issue.

Another plan of the court this
year is to have all. men who go
before the court three times to wear
yellow caps, thus pointing them
out to upperclassmen and putting
them under strict observation.

COLLEGE UNDERGOES...
(Contipued from Page One)
The reason for such a survey is
that inflation and rising costs work
against colleges and universities,
particularly because of the rela-
tively fixed source of income, The
purpose of the survey is to assist
and make improvements in adminis-
trative effectiveness with the end

result of making the money availa- School Admission Test required of

ble zo as far as possible; making
any and all economies that are prac-
tical, as well as more efficient and
effective use of existing physical
facilities.

The college is being assisted in
the expense of the survey hy the
Fund for the Advancement of fdu-
cation, part of the Ford Founda-
tion. This is an honor to Davidson
in that only a limited number of
colleges are assisted by this fund.

Because of the abnormally fast
crawth of colleges and universities
a» well as hospitals, railroads and
other, organizations, stich a survey
is made very practical in that in-
efficiency can be recognized and
dreatly reduced, saving the institu-
tion often large sums of money an-
nually,

Other colleges which have re-
cently had this type of survey are
Wellesley, Vassar, Yale, Vander-

‘bilt, Colgate, Oberlin and many

Princeton, N. J. — The Law

Year's Rules

Tt was recently decided by the
Erwin Lodge Committee that of-
ganizations and individuals outside
the town of Davidson, will be able
to make reservations only two
jweeks-in advance of any event to
be held in Erwin Lodge.

This rule will apply only during
the school year and is designed to
assure a priority to individuals and
organizations in Davidson over in-
dividuals and organizations outside
the town of Davidson.

Each person responsible for mak-
ing a reservation is requested to do
so as far in the future of any event
as possible, giving name, date,
hours to be used, and a phone
contact.

Mr. Shaw Smith handles reserva-
tions for the lodge and can be
reached in room 113 Chambers’
Building, phone 6921. As in the
past, there will be no charge for
the use of Erwin Lodge.

applicants for admission tp. a num-
ber of leading American law
schools, will be given at more than
100 centers throughout the United
States on the mornings of Novem-
ber 15,°1952, February 21, April 25,
and August 8, 1953. During 1951-52
over 6800 applicants took this test,
and their scores were sent to over
100 law schools.

A candidate must make separate
application for admission to each
law school of his choice and should
inquire of each whether it wishes
him to take the Law School Admis-
sion Test and when. Since many
law schools select their freshman
classes in the spring preceding their
entrance, candidates for admission
to mext year's classes are advised
ordinarily to take either the No-
vember or the February test.

The Law School Admission Test,
prepared and administered by Edu-
cational Testing Service, features
objective questions measuring ver-
bal aptitudes and reasoning abiltiy.

Bulletins and applications for the
test should be obtained four to six
weeks in advance of the desired
testing date from Law School Ad-
mission Test, Educational Testing
Service, P. O. Box 592, Princeton,
N. J. Completed applications must
be received at least ten days before
the desired testing date in order to
allow ETS time to complete the
necessary testing arrangements for
each candidate.

the South will lose its Senate committee chairmenships if the
Republicans win, as it is his duty to remember that his idea is
state’s rights. Furthermore we must not be taken in by false
implications such as those found in the word socialism.

More than ever before it is our duty to urge a decision
based on reason rather than on emotion. Our future may de-
pend on it. Don’t let the statement that a certain candidate will
lose because he is supported only by the rational voters ever be
proved in America from this day. We ate the generation that
can make reason good in politics—G.A.B.

Students are invited to the homes
of faculty members and staff on
Sunday evenings after vespers again
this year as has been the custom
for decades, according to an an-
nouncement from the office of Dr.
Sam Spencer, ‘assistant to the
president.

The members of the faculty and
staff rotate alphabetically so that
each opens his house to students
at least one night out of the month.

Students have been urged by the
administration to take advantage of
this opportunity to meet their pro-
fessors and to become better ac-
quainted with them.

The after-vespers schedule for the
month of October and each suc-
ceeding month follows:

First—Bevan, Brown, C.K., Dag-
gy, Davidson, Davis, Erwin,
Fulcher, Goldiere, McCutchan, Mc-
Gavock, Martin, D. G., Miller Pie-
tenpol, Schenck, Vowles.

Second—Bailey, Crawford, Johns-
ton, McGeachy, Martin, J. E., Me-
bane, Moore, Morton, Plott, Pur-
cell, Reid, Thompson, Tyson,
Watts, Workman, Woods.

Third -— Baumann, Blanton,
Brown, E. E., Buel, Causey, Cum-
ming, Cunningham, Griffin, ‘Lilly,
Parker, Puckett, Ratliff, Scott, Shu-
ford, Spencer, Trakas, Whittle.

Fourth — Beaty, Corriher, Eber-
hardt, Gallent, Gehring, Gunn, Ives,
Jones, Kimbrough, Labban, Logan,
Peak, Shewmake, Terwey, Thies,
Wilsom

Fifth—Nobody.

spends on football and the fact

fidence and respect of his men.

Then the new Cat coach set about
teaching his players some of the
tricks which made him a won-lost
record of 114-44, two state cham-
pion teams at Fayetteville High
School, and pulled Eastern Caro-
lina out of the football doldrums.

He showed them the Notre Dame
box, and he showed them new stuff
from: the T and the split-T, and
he showed them some beautiful pass
patterns. In short, he showed them
how to win.

Now Bill Dole will have to keep
after his club until they learn the
Dole system well enough to win
with it. Whether that will happen
this season or later on is one no-
body could answer right now. But
so far he’s done a good enough job
to make the most outstanding Wild-
cat in the vicinity, bar none.

Ruth to Pace Attack

Coach Dole will again be de-
pending on smooth quarterback
Jack Ruth to carry the fight for
the first football victory of 1952.
Jack has the distinet honor of lead-
ing the list of SC passers this week
with a completion record of 15 out
of 30 for a 500 mark. Bobby Renn
will see plenty of action and his
second-place 40.1 punting average
will get a good test.

Also the men who looked so good
in the fine fast week will be de-
pended on heavily and will have to
hold the thin line for 60 minutes
Dickie Davis, Arnold Whisnant,
Neil Graham, Bobby Loy, Ben
Craig, and Dick Kelley, to mention
a few, will have the chore of carry-
ing the fight to the costaless men of
the 'Pack.

BASKETBALLERS ...

Variable Offense

Whether to use the control
type or the fast-break brand of
play will be determined by the
opponent's personnel and de-
fense. Coach Miller plans to
employ mostly the man-to-man
defensive set-up with the zone
used when necessary.

Coach Miller has high hopes for

TO OFFER BOTH REGULAR & KING-SIZE .

BOTH regular and king-size
Chesterfields are premium quality
cigarettes and come in the smart
white pack.

BOTH contain only those proven in-
gredients that make Chesterfields
the best possible smoke: the
world’s best tobaccos, pure, more
costly moistening agents (to keep
them tasty and fresh), the best
cigarette paper that money can
buy — nothing else.

BOTH are much milder with an ex-
traordinarily good taste and, from
thereport of a well-known research
organization — no unpleasant
after-taste.

BOTH are exactly the same in all ree
spects. There is absolutely no difference
except that king-size Chesterfield is
larger — contains considerably more of
the same tobaccos — enough more to
give you a 21% longer smoke, yet costs
