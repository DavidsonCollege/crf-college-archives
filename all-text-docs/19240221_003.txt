Of all the bad boys in the school,
The worst is Pinkie Baker,

He took his girl to the golf course
And tried to undertaker,

(Note—He says he will never undertake
to teach another girl golf).
Of all the Freshmen in the school,

The Worst is Willie Kiser,

He sees some classy looking dame

And then he ups and buys’er
Candy.

Of all the tightwads in this place,
Most stingy is C. Monk,

He wears my collars, socks and ties,
The dirty little skunk.

Lest we forget and cause to fret,
We'll mention Reuben Curdts,

He necks the women good and strong,
And hugs them till it hurts.

{

And then we'll tell another one

Of lucky Pat MeNair.

He shoots the poor profs up and down
And bulls them with hot air.

Not to forget poor William Glenn.

His mama asked him where he'd been,
He said, “Why, Maw, no place perhaps,
I've just got shipped for shooting crops.”

But last we'll sing a requiem
For lowly J. A. Minter;

He tried with much mistake to wear
His B. V. D.'s in winter,

(Continued from page 1)

“If we are to have a true revival, we must
wait on the Spirit. Even Christ, in all His
power, waited on the Spirit. He arose carly
and went into the mountain to pray. If
Christ had to wait on the Spirit, how can
lve expect to have revival,
jawakening of God's
‘wait upon the Spirit’?

“But what was the result of this waiting ?
‘Before, Peter denied that he knew Christ:
after waiting, he stood up and said, ‘Though
you slay me yet will I not leave Him.’ Fol-
lowing the waiting on the Spirit, a great
revival, a God-made revival, occurred, and
three thousand were led to Christ.
And when a soul comes to Christ after such
a revival, you need not fear the sincerity
and the permanency of the conversion.

“If the revival is to come, it must come
in your heart. It must start in the hearts of
believers. When it gets into the hearts of
the believers, then others will be led to Him.
God's blessing waits on you. Will you let
; Him in?”

The speaker used several impressive illus-
trations ‘lich served to bring home to his
hearers great truths. One of these was a
story told by Dr. S. D. Gordon. “Christ
and Gabriel were in heaven, talking about
| things on earth. Christ told Gabriel, in an-
swer to his question, that He had come into
the world, suffered, died, for the world. He
told Gabriel that the only way He had for

who had been brought to Him, ‘But sup-
pose, Master, that down in the twentieth
‘century, the people become so busy about
| worldly affairs that they forget to tell oth-
ers about you?’ ‘In that case,’ spoke the
Messiah, ‘I have no other plans. I’m count-
ing on them.’” “Can you be counted on for
Him?” Will you teach others to say, Abba,
| Father ?”

Mr. King is assisted in the meetings by |

the meeting. The Columbia Quartet, com-

McInnis, also rendered several selections

the instance of Nicodemus talking to Christ.
