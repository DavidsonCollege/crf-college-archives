Sing! Dance! Listen!
First annual African-American Arts Assembly
celebrates various local talents, fills hearts in Hodson

By Hayes TROTTER
Guest Writer

To kick off the first annual Af-
rican-American Arts Assembly,
Assistant Dean of Students, Ernest
Jeffries, announced, “You will be
full when you leave.” His predic-
tion was exact. I left Hodson Hall
almost brimming.

Minutes after finding my seat,
Iabandoned it, attempting to jam to
the beat of two large congo drums.
Tia Leak, a member of the ASE
Drum Ensemble of New York City,
and her percussional skilled friend,
opened this celebration of the arts
with an invitation to dance. “There
is plenty of room in the aisles,” she
said, “so I hope you all aren’t afraid
to dance.” Most everyone left their
inhibition in their chairs and jumped
on the groove-train that was snak-
ing around the room. Most appro-
priately, this arts assembly was all
about interaction and sharing from

the very beginning.

Ike Bailey and Paul Eubanks
gave powerful readings of famous
literary selections, while Justin
Monroe and Ade Artis shared po-
etry and music of their own. It was
these personal creations that pro-
voked the audience to verbalize their
appreciation. Dr. Flannagan took
us on a journey with her short sto-
ries, and Patrick Daymond, wear-
ing traditional African garb, inspired
the crowd with his award winning
speech. Benin Ford calmly handled
a barrage of questions from those of
us who couldn’t get enough of his
paintings. “Are you willing to sell
your work?” someone asked. Al-
though he said he wasn’t yet ready,
the impact of his art and the whole
assembly was immediate.

This gathering of student and
faculty art performances was the
vision of two sophomores: Sherika
Allen and Ainsley Natta. The end
result was arich amalgam of music,

literature and visual art. The beauty
of this event was that it highlighted
the local talents, reminding us that
you don’t have to go very far to be
wowed or enlightened. We are for-
tunate enough to be surrounded by
an abundance of gifts from others,

‘and the whole event was certainly a

gift to the campus.

The African-American Arts
Assembly was an event that ap-
pealed to those celebratory emo-
tions we forget about sometimes.
There is so much to be proud of and
so much to learn from those around
us; it’s just a matter of getting to-
gether and sharing.

Before the evening was over,
everyone joinedin song. And much
as the assembly had started, itended
with the audience on their feet, sing-
ing, “let our rejoicing rise, high as
the list’ning skies...”” Hodson Hall
was full with a beautiful melody,
and so were those fortunate enough
to attend.

New club jazzes up Corntown night life

By Dave Ross
Guest Writer

For those of you seeking addi-
tional sources of entertainment out-
side of Davidson but closer than
Charlotte, read on. I speak of the
Jazz Note in Cornelius.

Previously the site of a jazz
club and then a sports bar, the Jazz
Note now resides behind the Rain-
bow Deli and next to the Thai res-

taurant. Offering bands every week-
end and some weekday nights, ‘it
features bands with an emphasis on
jazz (obviously) but also blues and
just about anything that isn’t classi-
cal, rock or country. Accounting
for this, there will be some that suit
your taste more than others, but I
have enjoyed the bands each time
I’ve gone. Also, some of the bands
play there semi-regularly, so if you
can plan to go when the bands you

know that you like will be playing.
The $5 cover is certainly worth it,
and if you go around midnight,
they’ ll probably halve it.
Definitely plan on removing
your cap and Davidson aura before

entering the Jazz Note forcomplete __

enjoyment. The bar is not a college
hang-out, and you must be seeking
something besides another place to

get drunk (although the attentive —

bartender and long counter are very
amenable.)

It’s a low-lit, groovy atmo-
sphere with a couple of couches and
a good arrangement of tables and
chairs. The music is usually loud
enough to enjoy but allows for some
close conversation. On Thursday
nights (9 p.m. - 1 a.m.) hop into
your leisure suit and go for Retro
Night; that is, retro 70s, not the
more familiar 80s. The cover is nil
and it’s a dancin’ good time.

Grab your honey or pal (if you
don’t have one, call me), change
into a hot outfit (if it’s Thursday;
just chill ifit’s not) and check it out.

Express
yourself.

Free your
mind.
