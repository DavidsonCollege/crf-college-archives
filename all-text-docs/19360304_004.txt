P-poRT— Wildcats Matmen Lose

to Carolina Wrestlers

By HARRY KUYKENDALL
boxing-consciotis at-

Thoroughly
ter witnessing Davidson's annual
slugfest, the Intramural boxing
tourney, it behooves7us spectators
to give our opinions even though
they be void of any significance.

Departing from the usual pro-

cedure, first we want to say a word
or two in favor of the losers. Most
of them, it can truthtully be said.
knew the odds were against their
chances of winning. vet they step-
ped into the ring with the idca of

doing their best and putting up a
game struggle. It takes ability to
“give.” but gust as tunporiant. “it
calls for courage and a sporting
spirit to “take” your medicine when
you can get out of it casy enough.
Thus to Pete Marchant, Lee Bank-
head, Jim Morton, Civde Daily. Jack
Tillotson. Mokey Faison, Harry
Gastieger and “Skinny” Stevens, Wwe
hand down a few imaginary bou-
quets’ “You've got to losé before
you can win,” so keep at it.

Here are our nominations for
the finals: Closest bout—Morton
and Ritchie. Scrappiest — Mc-
Clellan and Faison. Also Isler

- and Bankhead. Coolest individ-

ual—Virgil Ritchie. Best loser
—Jack Tillotson. Greatest dis-
advantage in height—Midge”
Verble, Others reasons “why:”
Ed Donigan’s swinging left. Is-
ler’s experience ... Verble’s ag-
gressiveness ... Bob McClel-
lan’s punch. Greatest disadvan-
tage in weight: “Skinny” Ste-
vens,

Disheartened by several cadastro-
phes of the present season, David-
son's varsity “grunts and groancrs”
dropped the last meet of the season
against _a. state team _to—Truck”
Quillan’s ‘Carolina’ Tar Heels. The
University mentor stated aiter the
game “It was undoubtedly the fast-
est and most interesting mateh that
I have seen this vear” so Doc Un-
Ger’s proteges shouldn't be discour-,
aged wiih whe showing they have
made this vear pacucularly after the
victory over MaryvilleTennessee’ 8

champs.
re to Ed

Bob Blue,
Tankersley of Carolina, stated
that the latter was the “coolest”
grappler he has met this year.
The Carolina star, a sophomore,
has had a pretty fair season this
year, having defeated Rogers of
Navy and several other lumin-
aries, and next season’s match
between the two should prove ~
interesting. “Tank” had plenty
of compliments for Bob's.
“strength” when interviewed in
Greensboro.

The 145 pound class brought the
keenest disappointment ané best
display of courage of the series
when Frank Owen, who had over
four minutes time advantage over
Captain Bonner, slid off the mat and
sustained a deep cut over his right
eye. The plucky Davidson, senior, in
an almost semi-conscious condition,
continued until the end of the
match. However, Frank did not
have énough time to give him the
decision, necessitating an extra pe-
riod. which was given to the Tar
Heel captain as Owen was unable
to continue. °

Coach Quinlan remarked that
it, was “too bad Blackwelder
couldn’t enter .the Southern
Conference meet, he'd win it in
a walk.” We also believe Char-
lie Parker and Jim Hodgin
would make good.

Very little has been said about
this year’s basketball team. Al-
though the number of wins has
been discouraging, .it was very evi-
dent that the local quint was-mak-
ing a vast.improvement the latter
part of the season. We are look-
ing on this year’s activities as one
of preparation for a very success-
ful season next year as the entire
team will return then.

Coach Newton is experimenting
with the “military shift” which is
the one-staged here on Richardson
fiéid this fall by the Citadel team.

Eight Boxers Crowned
As Intramurals Close

McClellan, Donigan, _ Isler,
Crabb, Ritchie, Verble, Mathis
And Johnson Win

Boxing champions were crowned
in eight divisions last Friday night
as the annual Davidson college in-
tramural tournament came to a
close in the gymnasium.

Four of the scraps ended in tech-
nical knockouts, Bob McClellan,
105 pounder, making quick work of
his ?foe, Mokey Faison, stopping
him in the first round. Eddie Don-
igan was too strong for Pete Mar-
chant in the 115 pound class and
the bout-was stopped im the second
round,

Bankhead lasted until the third
round with Isler, but the latter
packed a little too much punch
ior him, his seconds tossing in the
towel. Crabb, the most polished
boxer in the meet and Golden
Glove Champion from Texas, won
a technical knockout over Daily in
the second round. Both of these
men weighed 145 pounds.

Ritchie and “Tiger Morton,” 135
pounders, threw the gloves on even
terms for two rounds, but Ritchie's

left hook proved to be the winning

margin in a-close decision, as he
won the last round.

Stocky Midget Verble’s lefts and
rights to the head spelled defeat
for lanky Tillotson. Merble took
the first round, using left and rights
to the head; the second round was
even; and the last round went to

}

Midget by a wide margin.

George ‘Matthis had too much on
the gloves for Gasteiger, and al-
though the Jatter put up a game
fight, George .won-a clean cut de-
cision.

“la the finat bout of the evening
Big Six Johnson won a decision ov-
er Stevens. Stevens was. game, but
was outclassed by “Big Six,” the
latter having a weight advantage of
thirty pounds,

In the semi-final Thursday after-
noon, Ritchie won a decision over
Gilbert, Morton got the nod over
John Andrews, and Bankhead ad-
vaneed to. the finals with a close
win over Robinson.

The bouts were refered by Major
Cochran, while Coaches Red Laird,
Doc Unger and Gene McEver serv-
ed as judges. The winner in each
class will be awarded silver boxing
gloves in the form of a watch fob.

The Davidson yearlintts got off to

the short end of.a 12-3 score. Dut
here they rallied and. at the énd of
the period had cut down their op-
ponents’ lead to two points, the
score being 18-16,

During most of the second half
they played on even terms with
the Tarbabics, as Iverson and Tice.
the Davidson forwards, began to
sink ‘em rapdly. However, , with.
only a very few minutes to play the
Carolina Frosh ran up a lead too
big to be overcome. Iverson was
high scorer with 12 points, closely

followed by Bill McCachren and

garnered 11) and 10 respectively.

The Davidson Wildkittens finish-
ed one of the most successful sea-
sons that any freshman basketball
team here at Davidson has -had in
recent years. They won over half
of their-games and dropped con-
tests only to the “Purgl-Peps,” N.
C, State and Wake Forest,

Statistics at the end of the sea-
son revealed that Ned Iverson had
maintained his carly lead in total
points scored; he was followed by
“Little Swede” Johnson and John
Tice. Close behind were Bill Boyd
ant Jack Lee, whose totals differed
only by two points, Other mem-
hers of the squad were Perry Sloan,

Cat Second Half Rally Unable
To Catch Phantoms

The Davidson Wildcats closed
their 1936 season by dropping a
31-16 decision to Coach Skidmore’s °
White Phantoms, Big Five cham-
pions, in the Carolina Tin Can on
Saturday night.

The game. opened very slowly,
and neither team was able to break
the scoring ice for the first five
minutes. Kinally Captain Jim Me-
Cachren, stellar Tar Heel guard
and super-floorman, sank a_long
goal from the middle of-the floor
fo put the home team ahead, and,
for thé remainder of the game the
‘Cats were unable to catch the fly-
ing Phantoms.

The first half proved to be a
nightmare to the invading Wildcats,
who were able to tally but five
points against Carolina’s total of
twenty-one. The basket by Mee
Cachren unleashed Carolina’s vaunt-
ed scoring punch, and, in the face -
of a dazzling passing attack, the -
‘Cats were snowed under by a
steady. stream of baskets,

Davidson came on the floor at the
start of the second half with a real
fighting spirit, and the Wildcats
proceded to outscore *Skidmore's
charges 11-10. The ‘Cat passing
was more accurate than in the pre:
ceeding session, and the Wildcats
were able to work their set plays to
better advantage.

Peabody with four points was
high scorer for Davidson, followed
by Reid and Hancock, with three
points apiece. Melvin Nelson, star
Heel forward, led the victors with
eight points, while Mullis and Ka-
veny chalked up six points to tic
for runner-up honors. Quick turn-
ed in his usual splendid brand of
ball, and Armstrong, Reid, Knorr,
and Hancock ably supported Quick
and Peabody in a fighting finish
that was unable to overtake Caro-_
