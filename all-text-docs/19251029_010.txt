WILDCATS AND WOLFPACK BATTLE ON RICHARDSON FIELD

day Against Great Hurricane—
Tied Wake Forest

Comparative scores, the wrecker of many
a championship team, are few and far be-
tween when one looks forward to Saturday's
football clash between the Davidson and N.
C. State elevens, played for the first time
since 1899 on the Davidson field. Also, and
again for perhaps the first time singe the by-
gone nineteenth century, the comparative
scores fail to point to a comfortable margin
for the Raleigh Techmen, Around a long and
circuitous route one must go to even geta
comparison of the two teams, State having
won two and lost three games to teams that
Davidson, loser in only one of its six con-
tests, has not as yet met.

The only chance inside North Carolina of
comparing the teams comes through the State
game with the University and the Davidson
contest with Wake Forest. After losing 7-0
to Wake Forest the Tar Heels journeyed
over to Raleigh and whipped State by a 17-0
score, the greatest margin in the history of
the Fair Week classics. Just ten days pre-
ceding that Davidson earned fame by tieing
the Wake Forest aggregation 7-7. But the
North Carolina eleven that won over N. C.
State was far from being the weak squad
that fell before Coach Garrity’s attack.

Going outside of North Carolina one finds
that Wofford, defeated by the Wildcats 7-0,
was also ‘loser to V. M. I. by a 9-0 score.
Saturday State went down before a great
Flying Squadron by a 27-6 score, and the
stock of the Techmen fell at the same time.

State, while losing three of the five games,
has shown great potential power and an of-
fense that will some day spring a surprise in
North Carolina football circles. They have
played some strong teams in the three South-
Atlantic States, outplaying the South Caro-
lina Gamecocks though losing 7-6. Whether
Coach Tebell will drive his team into a real
machine by Saturday is a question, but that

he has the power on his squad is beyond
doubt.

MARATHON RUNNERS MEET
BETWEEN FOOTBALL
HALVES

Davidson Selected Cross-Country
Team Tuesday to Meet Techmen
Today—Three Veterans

As an additional feature of the great day
prepared by the Davidson authorities for
the Home-Comers there will be a cross-coun-
try race this afternoon between the State and
Davidson runners, the event probably being
held between the first and second halves of
the Davidson-State football game.

The race is the first of the season for both
teams, and little can be said of the relative
strength of the squads. Last year State
placed ahead of Davidson in the state meet
at Wake Forest.

The tryouts for the cross-country team
were held last Tuesday afternoon on the
Concord-Dr. Grey road. Fourteen men en-
tered and got off with the gun at 4:30.
No particular effort was made to cover the
course in record time as it was desired to
save the men as much as possible for the
State College meet here Saturday.

The team was formed by taking the first
seven men to come in from the three-mile
run. The successful contestants were as fol-
lows:

Williford and Penn, tie for first place;
O'Neal, second; Treverton, third; Webb,
fourth; Miller, B; W., fifth; Ely, sixth.

Williford, O’Neal and Webb were mem- |,

bers of last year’s team, the four others be-
ing new men in this branch of track. Fresh
Ely was the only member of his class to
place on the team.

These men have worked hard and con-
sistently for over a month and should make
a good showing Saturday.

Philosophy class: “It still has some ef-
fect on the tide.”

untied.”

CAPTAIN BLACK

Black First Laval
to Lead Wildcats

Capt. William M. (Wick) Black, lead-
er of the Wildcats is the first boy ever
Al-
though many brilliant players have been
produced by the Davidson High team,
Wick is the first from its ranks to be
chosen to lead the college eleven. Cap-
tain Black was chosen before the first
game this fall when Captain-elect Boggs
failed to return.

to head a Davidson football squad.

Wick has a very brilliant record be-
hind him, in high school, prep school and
on the Wildcat team. He should keep up
his great record in the game today with
the Wolfpack. Playing several years on
the Davidson High team as_ fullback,
Wick made himself felt in the high school
circles in the state. At Greenbriar, he
had the misfortune of breaking his leg in
early practice and was unable to play on
that team. But on coming to Davidson
the following year he made the fresh
team and played in every game. He was
one of the most valuable men on the team
at that time.

Black has a remarkable record on the
varsity, in that he has never had time
called on him in any game. This is an
insight on the remarkable spirit of the
Wildcat leader. He has begun every
varsity game as fullback since his Soph
year, except in the recent Guilford game
when Coach Younger started his entire
second team. But in the fourth quarter
of this game, Captain Black led his first
team on the field and played the entire
time that they were in. Never in his
career has a substitution been made for
him in an effort to strengthen the team.

Two Wildcat Foes
Meet Old Dominion
Grid Squads Today

While Davidson and State are battling
on Richardson Field and Wake Forest is
entertaining the Guilford Quakers at the

Japtist camp all the other North Caro-

lina elevens are today playing Virginia |

teams except Carolina who plays Mary-
land. Last week was a cosmopolitan one
for the Old North State teams,
Davidson bowing to Furman 7-0, with
Carolina defeating a Georgia eleven in
Mercer, with Wake Forest being tramp-
led by the Florida Aligators as was the
case when North Carolina State met V.

M. I. and Duke University met William |

and Mary.

The biggest inter-state game in
section will of course be the annual Caro-
lina-Maryland clash. » are after fall-
ing’ before Coach Garfity’s team in the
opening game of the season picked up
considerably with three straight victories
over State, Duke and South Carolina.

However their win by the narrow mar- |

gin of one field goal over the admittedly
weak Mercer team was discouraging.

Duke University will encounter Rich-
mond at Durham, and all North Carolina
is hoping that the Methodists will not go
down so flatly as they did last week
against the William and Mary crew.

Both Duke and Carolina are yet to be
played by the Wildcat eleven, and the
Davidson fans-are looking with especial
interest to these games.

Hampden-Sidney, the next foe on the
Wildcat card, will battle with Elon,
lowned 34-0 by Davidson, in a game that
should go easily to the Virginia team.
Lenoir-Rhyne will play Roanoke, the
team that gained fame by tieing V. P. I.
early in the season.

That Furman game last week, though it
has been a week since it was played, has
not been forgotten and will not be for-
gotten as one of the pluckiest fights par-
ticipated in by the Wildcats. We lost
the game, and say the best team won,

| but they won because they had fought

for three quarters and a half against a
fighting team. They wouldn’t have
scored over the line is our firm convic-
tion.

One paper is already pointing to the
Davidson-Carolina match as a big fac-
tor in deciding the state race, make the
assumption that Davidson has already

defeated State. We are pointing to the
fray today, and are letting future games
take care of themselves.

CAPTAIN JOHNSON

|

|

|

Wolfpack Captain —
All-State Player

Captain Al Johnston, of the State Wolf-
| pack is one of the most brilliant players
|in the state at present. But due to in-
ljuries he has been out of every game
this season except one. Last year, after
| playing consistently throughout the sea-
}son he was awarded a position on the
|mythical but much coveted All-State
{team by practically every sport writer in
the state. He has played on the varsity
team at State for three years and has
been a most valuable man the entire
time.

In his high school days Captain Al al-
so made an excellent record playing on
the flashy Rock Mount high team for
three years. His last year, when he was
captain the team went to the finals in the
elimination contests in the eastern part
of the state. They were defeated only by
the strong Chapel Hill team. After this
year Johnston went to Carolina for a
yéar playing on fresh team there. He
was also a member of the Zeta Psi fra-
ternity there.

Johnston is not only on the football
team but is also a valuable member of
the nine. He has made a letter for one
year and will probably repeat his per-
formance this year. His position on the
nine is either on the third sack or im the
outfield. At Rocky Mount he also played
on the baseball team there but here he
pitched. He made his letter here for
three years.

For the entire season this year John-
|ston has been laid up with a bad ankle
| that has kept him out of several games.
| This is well now and he should be able

Last Davidson Victory
Over Wolfpack in 1902

On Greensboro Gridiron

State College Has Won Eight Games
From Wildcats and Tied Four

THREE SCORES UNKNOWN

First Game Between Two Teams on
Davidson Field Over Quarter
Century Ago

Back in the days of the flowing beard
and the flying wedge, back in the days
when the Wolfpack roved under the col-
ors of A. and M. College, back in the
19th century, Davidson and N. C. State
battled to a 0-0 tie upon the Wildcats’
own grounds. Since 1899 the two teams
have met off and on for 16 football con-
tests, but Saturday’s fray will be the first
since then to be played on the Davidson
field.

Looking for a Wildcat victory over the
Wolfpack one has to go almost that far
back into history, for in 1902 came the
second and last win of Davidson over
State. At that time the colors of the
Presbyterian school flew merrily over the
Red and White, for Davidson had won
two, lost one and tied one game. Since
then defeat after defeat has met the
forces of the Wildcats, and three times
the Davidson team has risen to glory by
ticing the heavier State teams. Last
year’s last-minute rally upon the sands
of .Pinehurst, when the Wildcat team
shot down the field for a 74-yard march
to touchdown to tie State 10-10 was by
no means the least of these Wildcat
struggles.

Fight times in the history of the game
the State forces have won from David-
son, the greatest score coming in 1919
when the Techmen ruled the field by a
36-6 score. However it was in 1917, when
Davidson’s team was acclaimed as the
“light-weight champions of the world”
by the Atlanta papers, that State scored
their greatest victory, 7-3.

The game this year will have more than
the usual importance, the Davidson team
being a strong contender for state honors
after tieing the Wake Forest eleven. Fol-
lowing the State game will come two
other championship clashes, with Caro-
lina and Duke, with a Hampden-Sidney
contest preceding both of these.

The following are the scorers of the
past games between Davidson and State:

1899 Davidson 0; Stateo. :

1900 Davidson 17; State o.

1901 Davidson 6; State 27.

1902 Davidson 5; State o.

1905 Record lost.
