Erratic Batters Fail Conference Tests

By HOWARD BOYD
Asst. Sports Editor

This was supposed to be the
year for Davidson baseball.

However, the team has been
inconsistent at the plate and
woeful in the field, and has fail-
ed to live up to pre-season ex-
pec.ations.

Last weekend’s road trip prov-
ed disastrous, as the Cats drop-
ped three straight conference
games.

VMI blanked the Cats 3-0 Sun-
day, and Monday Richmond
swept a twinbill 5-4 and 8-6.

The losses dropped Coach Tom
Stevens’ squad to a 1-6 confer-
ence mark and 7-10 in all games.

“I’m real disappointed,” com-
mented Stevens, ‘‘and the boys
are, too. They know they’re bet-
ter.”

Stevens indicated that chang-
es are in store for the team, as
he makes a determined effort
to snap the team out of the dol-
drums.

“I’m thinking about switching
some people around. I’m still
trying to find the right combi-
nation on defense.”

The Cats were guilty of 14 er-
rors in the three games, and
Stevens poimed to this ‘‘inabil-
ity to make the routine play”
defensively as their downfall.

Against VMI, freshman
Dwight Plemmons pitched what
Stevens termed ‘“‘the best he’s
pitched all year,” allowing just
four hits and only one earned
run.

However, the team did not hit,
and Stevens is baffled by this
inconsistency at the plate.

“‘We seem to hit good pitch-
ing better than poor pitching,”
the veteran skipper lamented,
noting that the VMI hurler was
not especially strong.

Against Richmond the team
ripped 22 hits, but fell apart de-
fensively, committing ten er-
rors.

Stevens singled out freshmen
Bill Todd and George Weicker,

who sparked the Cats’ batting
barrage.

Todd rapped four hits, includ-
ing a controversial double
(which Stevens felt was a home-
run) and Weicker ‘“‘hit like I've
been expecting all season,” said
Stevens.

Stevens attributed the defen-
Sive problems to a number of
weaknesses, particularly in the
infield.

He pointed out that Mark
Rodgman has had to adjust at
third base from catcher, his
normal position, in order for
Stevens to get his bat into the
lineup.

Jack Latimer’s knee injury
has reduced his mobility at sec-
ond and shortstop Jack Willits
is not playing up to his capabil-
ities, according %o Stevens.

In an effort to improve the
team's defense, Stevens indi-

cated that he may use Bick
Halligan, a slick fielder but a
weak hitter, more in the future.

“I'm willog to give up some
hituing for defense right now,”
Stevens commented.

“We're capable of beating
anyone, but we just haven't

been able to put it all togeth
er.” he added.

Greg Sikes leads the team in
hitting wih a 346 average, fol-
lowed by Weicker at .339. Har
old Wilkerson at .287 and Jack
Willits at .274.

Plemmons and Mike Frye are
the team’s top pitchers. Plem
mons sports a 2-2 record with
a 2.54 ERA, while Frye tops
the mound staff with a 1A6
ERA.

Yes.erday the Cats faced Pfeif-
fer in) Misenheimer, and they
travel to East Carolua for a
twinbill tomorrow.

improving Netters Whip Dogs

By TOM AINSWORTH
News Editor
“The best play of the whole
year” was how tennis coach
Harry termed his
team's in their

Fogleman
performances
lus: two matches.

Playing down in Charleston,
S. C. last Saturday against The
Citadel, Fogleman thought that
it Was a much closer match
than the Cats’ winning 7-2 score
widicated.

The netmen won five of their
six Singles matches in straigit

sets, with Dave Weaver picking
up the only los to the Bull
dog's Phil Gaillard in straight
sets of 3-6, 1-6.

Davidson also picked up two

doubles matches to round out,

the total.

The Cats lost to N. C. State
last Tuesday, however, by an
identical 7-2 tally, in which six
of the nine matches had to go
three sets.

Weaver fell again, this time
in three seis to the Wolfpack:’'s
Thorny Strong 4-6, 6-3, 4-6.

Likewise, all of the doubles
matches went three sets with
the Cats at match point several
times, only to lose.

Nevertheless, Fogleman prais-
ed his team's style, commenting
that they seem to be ‘thinking
better.”

“The boys now realize that
you've got to get the ball over
‘he net and into the court,” he
added.

“If we play as well as we did
in the last two matches, we can
win the majority of our remain-
ing games,” commented Fogle-
man in reference to his future
schedule which includes both
Furman and the Naval Acad-
emy.

Bill Allen is Fogleman’s choice
for the player performing the
best so far, with Gary Bressler
also showing more consistency
in his game.

In regard to last week’s ten-
nis article in which he criti-
cized the team’s performance
and attitude, Fogleman said
that his team members ‘‘prob-
ably weren’t too happy with it,
but if it shook them up, it did
some good.”

The team plays Richmond
and V.M.I. today in a round-
robin tournament in Lexington.

6-11, , from Charlotte.

At the ‘end position, Fagg sign
ed a pair of 175-pounders. They
