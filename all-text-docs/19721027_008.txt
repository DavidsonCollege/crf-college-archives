Scott Hopes To See Coeds In Athletics

Davidson's membership in

the Southern Conference might

be one drawback, however. The

constitution and by-laws of the
conference specifically prohibit
participation in varsity sports
by non-males.

about the possibility of my

Skippers Welcome Coed Crew

By JOHN McELVEEN
Staff Writer

For the first time in the
history of Davidson sailing, the
Davidson sailing team has
females ‘‘manning"’ the helm.
The team took on a new
image this year with the add-
ition of four coeds.

The girls said they enjoyed
the sport even though it was not
as vigorous or exciting as
rugby, football or basketball.

“IT like to try different
things,’ said Tracy Lucille
Charles. *‘Football's too rough

and lacrosse too brutal. Sailing
is both exciting and relaxing.”

VARSITY COED
Tracy Charles is one of four coeds on the Sailing team.

“It's a totally different
sport,’ she added. ‘At times
one enjoys the water and the
sun. You talk and joke with
each other. But during races, no
communication.”

‘We have to listen for com-
mands from the skipper and
keep the other boats under
close observation, informing
the skipper of their position.”
she said.

Kathy Huntly had some
sailing experience due to her
summer employment at Camp
Seafarer, but the other girls are
relative newcomers to the
sport.

“Vicki Falme Brooks, Sue
Dixie Dawson and I had some
experience, and were very in-
terested,’ Charles continued.

Like the other members of the
team, the coeds have to prac-
tice three or four times a week.
Three of the girls function as
crews. and Dawson skippers.

“Outside of Daryl (Douglas
commodore of the team), Mark
Leonard and me, she's the most
competitive,” said junior skip-
per Frank Sommerville. ‘She
really shows a lot of potential.
As for Tracy. she’s the best
crew on the team.”

Like any other sport, sailing
has its own jargon, but the
jargon can mean the difference
between first and last place.
Both skipper and crew have to
have a command of the ter-
minology.

“I learned more sailing ter-
minology on the way to The
Citadel regatta than during
practice.” Charles said. “We
‘luffed the car to the windward’.
I've learned a lot. but there is
still a lot to understand.”

Charles said she was im-
pressed by the dedication of the
Davidson skippers. and pleased
to be member of the team.

“They're so intent on

introducing a motion to allow
girls to enter into non-contact
sports such as tennis, golf,
swimming, and others,"’ Dr.
Scott explained, ‘‘We'll be
discussing this, but I don't

’ anticipate any opposition to it

from our

Department."

Scott said that the Tuesday
vote of the National Collegiate
Athletic Association executive
council to recommend lifting
the ban on women athletes
competing in NCAA events
could have a strong impact on
the Southern Conference.

**We would probably fall into
line right behind the NCAA,”
Scott said.

Outside of the conference
rules, chances also seem to
favor some kind of girls’ sports.
Davidson is interested in
organizing games and fielding
teams with any schools in the
area on an informal basis,
according to Scott.

‘‘We may not have a sizeable
interest this year, since we have
only about fifty girls. As the
enrollment grows, though, we'll
be looking for opportunities to
compete in tennis, golf,
swimming, and sailing,’ Scott
said.

Scott said that he did not

Little Communication

know of any inter-collegiate
girls’ teams in the other
Southern Conference schools,
but he mentioned the possibility
of fielding teams against Duke,
Mary Baldwin, Queens, UNC-
C, or Salem.

“We won't be restricted,”
Scott added. ‘‘If there are girls
on campus who want to form
teams, we'll make every effort.
Already two girls have
approached me who are
interested in tennis, and we
have every indication that a lot
of talented girls are Davidson
students."

“There is an obvious need for
new facilities in this regard---a
bigger girl's locker room. They
have only twelve lockers down
there right now. This can be
adjusted, of course."’

Girls here are subject to the
same physical education
requirements for graduation as
men. They will be mixing with
the men’s classes in most of the
areas.

Scott said that girls would
take part in volley ball,
swimming, tennis, paddle ball,
bowling, golf, and first aid.

“I think as the school
becomes more evenly co-ed
there will be a lot of support for
such teams as swimming,
tennis, golf, and maybe even
riflery. I've been shooting with
the riflery team, so I don’t know
why girls wouldn't be willing to
support each other and the
activities,"’ commented Ann
Day, an Eight College
Exchange student from Mary
Baldwin.

Few Coeds Involved
In Fall Intrumurals

By GREG DUNN
Staff Writer

Although Davidson's newest
students, the coeds, are able to
participate in intramurals not
one has yet to take advantage of
the program.

The reason for this is that the
girls either do not know they are
allowed to participate or they
are unaware as to how to go
about entering intramural
events.

There seems to be a lack of
communication between the
IMAC office and the coeds.
Margaret Finlayson summed
the situation when she said ‘I
haven't heard that much about
it.”

Chip Stone. intramural
director. said that non-existant
coed turnout in flickerball was
expected but that he was
“disappointed that none of the
coeds participated in the golf
tourney.”

Among the coeds the most
popular sports seem to be
tennis. sailing and surprisingly.
basketball. The girls all
asserted that they would like to
participate but that they didn't
know how to go about it
However. the entire fault is not
the communication problem
One of the coeds — said that
“Somebody came up to me and
asked if | would play on their

basketball team.” She had to

decline because she didn't know
the rules.

The coed reaction to separate
intramural programs for men
and women was mixed. Most
felt that at the moment it would
be infeasible but it was a
possibility in the future.

Many girls were of the
opinion that although the
combined intramurals would be
fun, the competition would be
fiercer in a seperate program.

They felt that most girls could
not play well enough to be a
factor in the intramural, finals,
with a few embarrassing (to
Davidson males) exceptions.
One coed said that separate
programs ‘would be better
because they would be more
serious.”

Overall feeling among the
coeds was that the program as
it exists is fine but once more
coeds were on campus that
separate programs would be
desirable.

Sandy Herring expressed the
popular opinion on separate
programs, not with this few
girls. maybe later.

Among the men. reaction to
women in intramurals seems to
be favorable. Most of the guys
consider the coeds a plus to the
intramural program and not a
challenge to their masculinity
As one jock put it “il they want
to participate they should be
allowed.”
