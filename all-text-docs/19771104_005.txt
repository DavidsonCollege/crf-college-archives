Irving and Van Winkle come home

By SUE FIELDS ROSS
Associate Dean of Students

When Washington Irving returned
to America in 1832 after seventeen
years abroad, it was almost as if he
were reliving the experiences of Rip
Van Winkle, a character he had
presented to the world thirteen years
earlier. An unpublished journal which
Irving kept during August 1832, only
four months after his return to his
native land, suggests that in the case
of Irving and Rip, life was imitating
art.

Even though Irving was the best
known native American writer of the
day, he was nervous about his
“reentry” into American life. Sydney
Smith’s question in the January 1820
Edinburgh Review, ‘‘In the four
quarters of the globe who reads an
American book?” was unfortunate in
its timing, as the popularity in
England of the author of The Sketch
Book (1819) rivaled Sir Walter
Scott’s. Even so, we sense Irving’s
trepidation about his countrymen’s
feelings when we read in an 1820 letter
to his friend Henry Brevoort,

‘“‘What I would not give for a few
days among the Highlands of the
Hudson, with the little knot that was

once assembled there! But I shall
return home and find all changed,
and shall be made sensible how much
I have changed myself. It is this idea
which continually comes across my

mind, when I think of home, and I
am continually picturing to myself
the dreary state of a poor devil like
myself, who, after wanderving about
the world among strangers returns
to find himself a still greater
stranger in his native place.”
By 1827 Irving was sensitive about
the criticism of his countrymen, and
he wrote to Brevoort,

“*...I must confess that for a time I
gave too much consequence to the
attacks I had seen upon myself in
the press and to anonymous letters
which I received from some malevo-
lent person seeking to persuade me
that I was in a manner cast off by
my countrymen. I am conscious that
my long absence from home has
subjected me to unfavourable repre-
sentation, and has been used to my
disadvantage...Do not let yourself
be persuaded therefore that time or
distance has estranged me in
thought or feeling from my native
country, my native places, or the

friends ‘of my youth.”

In the introduction to the American
edition of A Tour on the Prairies
(1835) Irving confesses publicly and
poignantly his fear of returning to
America in 1832 and his bewilderment
that Americans could have ever
doubted his patriotism.

In any case, Irving returned to
America in April 1832 and found his
friends faithful, his public enthusi-
astic, and his country changed. There
are interesting parallels in Irving's

and Rip’s.

Before Rip fell asleep for twenty
years, he had demonstrated an “‘insu-
perable aversion to all kinds of
profitable labor;”’ before going to
England, Irving’a~imduloent family
and SUCeéco-u- -sRi¢werbocker’s His-

tory of New York (1809) enabled him
to enjoy fully the good life. It was
during the difficult years in England
after suffering business losses that
Irving turned again to his pen for
livelihood.

When Rip awoke from his twen-
ty-year nap, he first discovered his
gun rusty, his dog gone, and his
joints stiff. Next he noticed that the
people in town were strangers, the

dogs barked at him, his beard was .

long, his house was mountains and
the Hudson River had endured. It is
interesting that soon after Irving’s
return to America, he embarked on a
trip described by a traveling com-
panion as ‘‘an excursion up the
Hudson River, and to the Katskill
Mountains, lingering for a few days
by the way, in a delightful retreat, in
the bosom of the Highlands.’’ Per-
haps Irving, like Rip was comforted
by nature’s constants.

One of the most drastic changes for
Rip Van Winkle was the political. Rip
noticed a change in the flag, now a
‘singular assemblage of stars and
stripes;’’ the red coat of King George
was now one of blue and buff, and the
sceptre had become a sword. Rip
answered the confusing question of
whether he was a Federalist or
Democrat by asserting that he was ‘‘a
poor quiet man, a native of the place,
and a loyal subject of the King, God
bless him!’’ The townspeople shout
accusingly, ‘‘a Tory! a spy!”’

Irving felt that his long absence
from his homeland, the choice of
European topics for his writing, and
his favorable critical reception abroad
had prompted the slander that he was

Letter to the Editor

“alienated in heart from (his) coun-
try.”’ It must have been a joyous relief
that Irving’s homecoming was more
pleasant that Rip’s. However, he did
find America very different politi-
cally: Irving had left his country in
1815,-immediately after the War of
1812 and during the presidential term
of James Madison. After an interval
in America of what some historians
call an “‘era of good feeling,’ which
included a friendlier attitude toward
Great Britain, the prevailing negative
attitude of many Englishmen toward
anything American prevented an easy
relationship from developing. When
Irving returned, Andrew Jackson had
been elected and Jacksonian Demo-
cracy was the political stance of the
day.

Even Rip, after finding many of the
leaders of the town dead, did redis-
cover many old cronies, but he
“preferred making friends among the
rising generation, with whom he soon
grew into great favor.’’ DeTocqueville
had written in 1831 that the old great
race of American men--men of culture
talent, character who had given this
country the Declaration of Indepen-
dence and a new democracy--was
disappearing. Henry Ellsworth, with
whom Irving traveled west, wrote
that Irving disliked ‘“‘political or pole-
mic discussions’’ and that with ‘‘the
great, he feels sufficiently acquain-
ted--He desires most to ramble among
the natural actions of men.’’ Yet

_Irving’s journal while it recounts

visits with many fo his old friends,
reveals that Irving met and talked
with men active in the current
political life of New York state, men

such as Senator William Learned
Marcy, a member of the*‘‘Albany
Regency’’ and soon to be the Demo-
cratic Party’s candidate for governor
of New York. Irving visited with
Governor Throop of New York,
Governor Duncan McArthur of Ohio,
and later with General William Henry
Harrison, to cite only a few.

Finally, on his reentry into local
society, Rip had to get reacquainted
with his family. He had left behind his
wife, the incorrigible Dame Van
Winkle, as well as a son and
daughter. Rip found his son grown
and indolent--a copy of Rip’s younger
self--and his loving daughter comfor-
tably married and the mother of his
grandson Rip. Even though Irving
was a bachelor, he was devoted
family man. One very human touch
revealed in this recently ‘‘discovered’’
1932 journal is the fact that during a
visit with members of his immediate
family, Irving, so long absent form
the extended family, systematically
listed at the end of the journal all of
his relatives by family groups.

Rip settled down to live a happy life
in the bosom of his daughter’s family
and among the friendly townspeople.
After his trip west, Irving bought
land at Tarrytown, built) Sunnyside,
and lived and wrote happily among
family and friends for the remaining
27 years of his life (with the exception
the the four years, 1842-1846, which
he spent in Spain as Minister to
Madrid).

It must have been a comfort to
Irving that his coming home had been
as pleasant as Rip’s and that in this
case life seemed to imitate art.

Should we give away the Canal?

To the Editor:

I write in response to the column
‘Panama Canal’s fate lies with us”, in
The Davidsonian, Oct. 28, 197 13
There were a number of inaccurate
statements made in the article that I
would like to comment on.

First of all, to say ‘‘we stole it fair
and square’ is an exaggeration.
Granted, the 1903 treaty is advanta-
geous to the U.S., but it must be said
that it was overwhelmingly supported
by Panamanians when it was signed.
It has since been modified several
times to benefit Panama.

The fact is that Panama’s chief
source of income is the canal. Contra-
ry to Ms. Sawada’s contention that
‘‘the revenues of her geographical
resource do not return to her’’,
revenues from the canal are channel-
led into Panama through employ-
ment, work projects, and business
given Panamanian merchants by
American military and canal person-
nel just to name a few.

Tourism, Panama's second source
of income, is generated by the canal.
The bulk of the wealth in Panama is in
the hands of a few business people
who have as much as said that if the
Americans leave the Zone, they will
take their money out of Panama.

One statement said, ‘‘Somehow we
don’t realize the amount of friction
present between the American com-
munity living in the Canal Zone and
the Panamanians.”’ 1 am curious as to

what Ms. Sawada hases. this state- S

menton. I have dared to venture into

Panama City and into the interior of
the country and have been received
openly arid without hostility by the
Panamanians I met. To my know-
ledge, this is the experience of other

Canal Zone residents. The alleged
friction lies in the hands of a few
radical factions in Panama.

The reference to the 1964 riots is
also incorrect. The incident was
triggered when Panamanian students
attempted to raise a Panamanian flag
in place of the American flag. When
American high school students moved
to stop them, fighting broke out. In
all, 22 Panamanians were killed. 21 of
them were in the process of looting
Panamanian stores and were shot by
Panamanian National Guardsmen.

It is true that Panamanians fill
eighty percent of the jobs required for
the operation of the canal. It is not
true that they are kept from occupy-
ing higher positions. This employ-
ment amounts to thousands of Pana-
manians earning salaries far above
Panamanian standards, resulting in a
large flow of money into an economy
that has sunk steadily since Omar
Torrijos took power.

The neutrality treaty is a farce. It is
nothing more than a device to help
President Carter sell the treaty to
opponents. Recent revelations have
also shown that Panama’s interpreta-
tion of this treaty is vastly different
from the American interpretation.

Lastiy, 1 Would like to comment on

what Ms. Sawada calls ‘‘the real issue
of the self-determination of the people
of Panama.” Self-determination is an
unknown entity in Panama. There are
no rights, human nor civil. There are
no free elections. Since Torrijos came
to power, numerous radio stations
and newspapers have been shut down.
All media are government-controlled.
Opposition to the government is
quickly and brutally suppressed by
the G-2, Panama’s version of the
KGB. Self-determination will never
be achieved as long as Torrijos is in
power, regardless of what happens
with the treaties.

We would be doing a grave injus-
tice to the people of Panama if we
solidified the position of the Torrijos

regime by giving him the canal.
