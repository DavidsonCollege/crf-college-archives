Leatherwood & Lisa Give
Hungry d Folk-Rock Blend

A REVIEW

By BOB DUNHAM
Editor-in-Chief

Alan Leatherwood is sensi-
tive to the audience's atten-
tions, articulate with a guitar
and fresh on the heels of the
Tim Rardin he resembles.

Lisa is a big-eyed, long-
haired beauty with a haunt-
ing ,smile-and-a-half and a
voice which sounds some-
what like Merilee Rush.

Together Leatherwood and
Lisa form a powerful group
which makes its final ap-
pearances this evening and
tomorrow night at the Un.
ion’s Hungry d coffeehouse.

Singing everything from
Hardin to McCartney. follow-

ing the traditions of every-
one from Buddy Holly to
John Sebastian and throwing
a good bit of their own tal-
ents into the show, the young
couple from Ohio has pack-
ed the Hungry d each night
this week.

They have shown no ex-
haustion from their 10-week
tour on the North Carolina
coffeehouse circuit and move
well as they perform.

The only slow portions of
the act come with Alan's sen-
sitive tuning of his 12-string
guitar between songs, but
once the action begins it
seems to keep beginning. He
moves from song to song with
unpredictable tempo changes
which keep the audience mov-

Dull SGA Stories
Give Hi-Po Win

THE DAVIDSONIAN has
won one first place and three
second place awards in the
1968-69 College Press Awards
competition sponsored by the
Charlotte Observer and Char-
fotte News...

The paper was named the
first runner-up to the Hi-Po
of High Point College in the
best small college (less than
3,000 enrollment) newspaper
competition, and three staff-
ers won individual awards as
well.

A staff writer for the Char-
lotte News said this week
that the main reason THE
DAVIDSONIAN lost a num-
ber of points was its too-ex-
tensive coverage of student
government, which he term-
ed “dull.”

ing with him.

The act was billed as ‘folk
rock with a lot of country.”
but the country in the act
was more of the Kentucky
country than the Nashville
variety. Songs such as Light-
foot's “Steel Rail Blues”’
and the quick moving ‘Blue
Moon" are the closest that
Leatherwood and Lisa come
to country.

At the opening night per-

formance Alan demonstrated
his sensitivity to the atten-
tion of the audience. Al-
though he commented later
that the reception was good,
he occasionally reprimanded
the whisperers in the audi-
ence.
-Lisa appeared at times as
the polished performer, but
off-stage she _ occasionally
lapsed into a teeny-booper-
ish outburst of ‘‘groovy..’

The young performer (she
is 20. Alan 24) has a moving
alto voice which turns sensu-
ous when deep and alive and
moving when high.

Both Leatherwood and Lisa
visibly express attachment to
their lyrics, often closing
their eyes and reaching for
a mood.

Their act includes a large
number of songs which can
be changed around with fre-
quency so that no two shows
are identical. And they vary
music types from song to
song to provide something
for everyone.

College Union Staffers
Consider Future Plans

By TOM SINKS
Staff Writer

The role of the Davidson
College Union in the future
is presently being explored
by a joint Union Board-Union
staff committee. The new Un-
ion Committee. composed of
Sam Boyte, Ed Embree, Jim
Vest, Tom Suitor and Weldon
Shenck. is presently studying
the union's role in two ways.

First, the committee has
gone back through Union rec-
ords to find who used the
Union facilities. In this way
they hope to see where a par-
ticular need is, and ‘to see
whether students or faculty
and administrative personnel
are using these facilities.

Boste pointed out that the
Wildcat A dining room was
vsed HH times in the past
year by the Union Board and
Sociat Council and 53 times
by non-Union groups.

He also indicated that there
was a need for a number of
small meeting rooms. These
smaller rooms could be used
for placement interviews and
similar meetings.

A second appraisal of Union
needs will come from a ques-
tionnatre which bas been dis-

tributed to students. The
questionnaire will allow the
students to indicate which
programs they favor and al-
low them to suggest what
course of action should be
taken in regard to the phys-
ical‘ plant of the Union

The committee hopes to be
able to decide whether we
should renovate the present
building, renovate and ¢eh-
large it, or build an entirely
new Union.

Once the commitee makes

lege has a number of prob-
lems presently, including ren-
ovation of the dorms.

Lisa stood out on Sebas-

Alan provided a version of
“Norwegian Wood."’ which
with Lisa's accompaniment
was stimulating to say the
least. Hardin's ‘Reason To

him most at ease.

Even the bawdy found its

‘Thirteen Days’ Exposes Doubt
That Haunts President In Crisis

A REVIEW

By JOHN McLEAN
Managing Editor

The Book-of-the-Month Club
called it ‘unique,’ a book
which is like none other ever
printed. It will probably re-
main a_ singular work for
many years to come.

In “Thirteen Days,’’ the
late Sen. Robert Kennedy pre-
sents a swiftly-moving narra.
tive account of the 1962 Cu-
ban missile crisis. The book
is unique in that Americans
have never had such an in-
side account of events of
such earth-shaking _ signifi-
cance told by one very pow.
erful participant in the dra-
ma about an even more pow-
erful man, the President of
the United States.

It’s needless to be re-

ing?

There are many irenic
twists to the drama which
are just coming to light with
the publication of this book.
Robert Kennedy admits that
neither he nor the President
could actually make out ob.
jects that were unmistakably
“missiles” from early recon-
naissance phosto but they had
to accept the interpretation
of the military experts.

But they rejected the Joint
Chiefs’ proposal to launch a
military invasion of Cuba to
relieve the missile threat
once and for all.

The President’s two closest
advisers, Robert Kennedy
and Robert McNamara. coun-
selled against such moves,
which would have invited re-
prisal, and instead proposed
the naval blockade which was

eventually put into effect.

Robert Kennedy never
boasts of his own role ii
forming the policy the Pres-
ident adopted. He calls it
a victory, and history will
judge it as the highlight of
John Kennedy's administra-
tion. .

But, as Kennedy says, it
was not a .victory for a
leader or a nation, but a
triumph for the people of
the world and succeeding
generations.

Robert Kennedy's sincere
treatment of ideals rather
than pragmatic  considera-
tions in reaching a decision
on the best response to Rus-
sia was impressive.

Robert Kennedy, as well as
the President, was haunted
by the spectre of nuclear
holocaust brought not by our
enemies, but by ourselves.

He remarks that “‘decisions
would be so much easier to
make if one didn’t always
have to think of the children
who had not lived and had a
say in the decision made by
leaders."'

Stit, “Thirteen Days”
coméxto the reader in un-
finished form, for. Robert
McNamara tells us, Kennedy
had planned to add a dis-
cussion of the basic ethical
question involved. whether
any government had a right
to cast its people under the
shadow of nuclear annihila-
tion.
