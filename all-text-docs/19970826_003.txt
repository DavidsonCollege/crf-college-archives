THE DAVIDSONIAN

MONDAY, AUGUST 25, 1997 Rees

By Sanpy HARTWELL

You would think this would be
easy.

After all, I’ ve had a lot of prac-
tice saying goodbye to my children.
From the first days of kindergarten
to summer camps to weekend to
weekend retreats and senior trips, I
have waved a lot of waves and said
some version of “Have fun: Be
careful. Do you have everything?”
a million times.

I am even experienced at say-
ing goodbye to Davidson freshmen.
My.son Randy was a freshman here
in the fall of 1993.

And now this week I say.
goodbye to my daughter Brooke as
she begins her freshman year here.
Iam, you might say, an old hand at
this goodbye stuff. ‘

So why doesn’t it get any
easier?

I have been putting this mo-
ment out of my mind for months. It
hasn’t been hard to do so; we were
busy getting ready.

We shopped and packed and
packed and shopped and gave our
local stores their best month since
Christmas.

“Put everything out and then
put half of it back,” a Davidson
letter advised. We put everything
out.and added a little more.

(What if it rains? What if it
snows? What if the laundry shrinks
all her clothes? What if the book-
store runs out of notebook paper?
What if there is no shampoo in
Mecklenburg County?)

Amazingly, it all fitin the truck,
and on a steamy Mississippi after-
noon a few days ago we left family
and friends behind in Pass Chris-
tian, Miss.

It’s a long way from south
Mississippi to Davidson. At least it
used to be, but the trip was shorter
this time, the miles passing too
quickly.. Together, we go north
from Mobile up green kudzu hills to
Montgomery and into Georgia.

. This trip, there was. not one
delay. No roadwork. No wrecks in

Atlanta to slow us down. North past
a dozen factory outlets — no stops
this trip — and past the giant South
Carolina peach.

How can we be in North Caro-
lina already? We just left home.
We got here so fast. Eighteen years
passed so fast.

But here we all are. Eighteen
years with many small and large
goodbyes under our belts, parents
and 472 new Davidson freshmen
are now here for the big College
Goodbye.

I am amazed at how different
and: yet similar we all are, how,
from so many places and back-
grounds, we have all found our-
selves here at Davidson today.

We have vans and Suburbans
laden with trunks and computers
and foam boxes. We unpack and
hold doors for one another. We
gamely carry rugs and refrigerators
and negotiate with Security for park-
ing spaces. There is excitement and
anticipation and anxiety.

Davidson’s support system
begins. Hall counselors:‘welcome
us and give comforting words and
explain the mysteries. of
Richardson’s room decor, and when
and why to yell, “Flushing.” (Men
have walked on the moon. Dormi-
tory plumbing has not advanced.)

Orientation is as I remember it
four years ago. There are some new
faces: President Vagt welcomes us
as President Kuykendall did in 1993.
Dean Terry has retired, and now
Dean Shandley greets us instead.
There are other changes: new fac-
ulty, new classes, new majors, and
co-ed dorms now.

But what strikes me immedi-
ately as Dean Williams and Dean
Shandley and President Vagt speak
is what has not changed in the four
years since I became a Davidson
parent. .

It is the enduring message and
mission of Davidson College:
honor, integrity, responsibility, and
a strong dedication to a liberal arts
education.

I remember why I'am proud of”

my children for choosing Davidson
— not the easiest route through
college — and why I am honored
that Davidson chose them.

As parent orientation closed,
we said goodbye to our children.

Final hugs and last-minute re-
minders in the parking lots, and
then we drove away. ‘

My daughter, who 13 years ago
this month explained to me that no
amount of new crayons or construc-

tion paper would entice her to go to”

kindergarten, is today hurrying me
— politely — to the parking lot. .

How canIbe sad when she is so ‘

happy? Today she likes — in no
particular order — her roommate,
her classes, her hall counselors, her
adviser, North Carolina weather,
and Commons food. :

It is possible — even probable
— her opinions on some of these
things will change. But I am confi-
dent the combined wisdom of
Brooke and Davidson College will

triumph, that her 18 years and .

Davidson’s 160 years will blend
well and make the right decisions.

Freshman Perspective on

~ HEATHER LYNN Lorcu

‘As I stepped out of the car on

‘Thursday morning, I was sur-

rounded by a sea of new faces, all in
a line advancing for the Union.

After a brief panic brought on
by the realization that I didn’t have
my social security card, I entered
the building only to discover that
there was no nametag with my name
on the table.

Obviously, this was not the
most comforting first encounter at
Davidson. I began having random
irrational thoughts such as, “Was I
really accepted here, or have I been
receiving mail for the past nine
months by mistake?”

As you can imagine, I was re-
lieved to hear later that I was not the

‘only freshman to experience this

dilemma: ;
Over the course of the first few

stations: during registration, I was
amused by the varied forms of en-
tertainment that I found. I realized
later that one in particular, juggling,
seemed to characterize balancing
life at Davidson.

This thought and the many lec-
tures given by faculty and staff
members led me to believe that a
big part of our lives over the next
four years will be spent “juggling.”
We will have to successfully com-
bine our academic, athletic, social,
and service schedules to truly un-
derstand life at Davidson and be-
yond. ‘

Although I couldn’t wait to
meet new friends and begin learn-
ing about the world, I wasn’t
pumped for: orientation initially.
However, the past four days: have
turned out to be an incredible vari-
ety of experiences which I hope
will prove to be representative of
life at Davidson.
