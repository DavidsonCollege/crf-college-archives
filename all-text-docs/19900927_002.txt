Hobart Park to Have
New Format

By DOUG GIBSON

A few years back, Davidson
student Michacl Jarmon decided
to resuscitate //obart Park, astu-
dent literary magazine: which had
folded a few years carlicr.

Inthe magazine’s firstycar, he
concentrated on establishing a high
quality publication in which the
best of Davidson’s student poctry,
fiction, and art could find an audi-
ence among the other members of
the Davidson community.

Later editors have continucd
to work towards this goal, and have
conunucd to produce a magazine
which showcases the work of tal-
ented students.

This year, the editors of [/obart
Park plan to take the next step up
from the foundation carlicr cditors

This year's editors hope
that the publication's
new format will be less
like its earlier chap-
book form and more
like a magazine.

have built. Under the leadership of
Clay Adams, Curt Perkins and
Toby Truog, the once annual pub-
lication hopes to become semi-
annual in anew format less like its
earlicr chapbook form and more
like a magazine.

Senior English major Clay
Adams will mainly control the
practical side of the magazine’s
production. He will, as he puts it,
“make sure that the magazine
works.” After his experience with
his high school literary magazine
and with his knowledge of the
student magazines which other
schools produce, he feels that
Davidson will be “able to produce
a magazine of exceptional qual-
ity.”

“We are aiming for a maga-
zine which will include all aspects

of campus life, a magazine which
will present a more well-rounded
view of Davidson and provide more
outlets of expression,” he says.

In order to do this, Clay hopes
to broaden //obart Park’s finan-
cial base as well as the range of its
submissions. At this point, the
magazine depends ona grant from
the Activitics Tax Council, but the
staff wants to solicit sponsors and
take on advertiscrs to supplement
this grant.

Clay, Curt and Toby are cofi-

centraling on producing a rctro-
spective edition which will high-
lightsome of the best work //obart
Parkhas published inan attemptto
show prospective sponsors. the
quality of work which the Davidson
community can produce.

In his role as literary cditor,
senior French major Curt Perkins
plans to widen the range of sub-
missions in order to best showcase
this quality.

As he sees it, his job will be to
ensure that there is more commu-
nity representation. “I want to have
a magazine which is not just for
English majors butalso for forcign
language majors, art majors... not
just for literature,’ either -- there
should be room for quality writing
of all kinds. We also want to have
faculty submissions.”

He insists that this is not the
last step in Hobart Park’s evolu-
tion: “our ultimate future goal
would be to produce a magazine
which would replace the Miscel-
lany {Davidson’s now defunct
national magazine]. A few ycars
from now, we might be onthe level
of the Sewanee Review, or the Al-
leghany Review.”

Toby Truog, a senior Art His-
tory major, will.deal with the vis-
ual arts’ place in Hobart Park.
Like his co-workers on the maga-
zine, he wants to broaden the
magazine’s scope.

New Book Examines Link Between Peruvian
Drug Trade and Terrorism

A new book by Gabriela Tara-
zona-Sevillano, examines one of
the most dangerous alliances in the
world today--the. link between
Peru’s radical Sendero Luminoso
terrorist group and the cocaine
trade.

Terrorism in South America is
far more prevalent than in the
Mideast or any other area of the
world, and the unholy alliance
between terrorist groups and drugs
is making the situation desperate
for the governments of the region.
It also represents a major, though
relatively little-known and under-
stood, threat to the United States.

Tarazona Sevillano, visiting
professor of International Studies,
says that Sendcro Luminoso’s
embrace of drugs as a means of
financing itsrevolution could doom
the struggling democracy in Peru
and even spread throughout the
rest of South America.

She has been invited to speak
about her findings ona panel at an
upcoming American Bar Associa-
tion confcrencc on “Strengthening
the Rulc of Law inthe War Against
Drugs and Narcoterrorism.”

The conference, which will be
held’ on October 11 and 12 in
Washington, D.C., will attract
some of the nation’s top legal, law
enforcement and national security
experts. Tarazona-Sevillano will
participate in a pancl on “Rule of
Law as Target,” speaking about
Sendero Luminoso’s terrorism in
Peru.

Her book is called Sendero
Luminoso and the Threat of Nar-
coterrorism. It was published re-
cently by Pracger in New York,
with the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washing-
ton, D.C.

But the real basis of her knowl-
edge is her two ycars of personal
experience as a criminal affairs
prosecutor of the Public Ministry
in the Peruvian judicial system.
From 1984 to 1986, that post
brought her face-to-face with Sen-
dcro Luminoso members and drug
traffickers daily.

Sendero Luminosocontols the
world’s largest cocaine-producing
region, the Upper Huallaga Valley
in Peru. More than half the coca
grown worldwide comes from this
tempcratc 400,000 acre area on the
castslope of the Andes Mountains.

other crops in the country, accord-
ing to the author. Tarazona-Sevil-
lano estimates that the two or more
crops annually harvested from the
region and processcd into cocaine
are sold on world markets forabout

$28 billion. International traffick-
ers and traffickers inside Peru re-
ceive more than 99 percent of that
cash. Less than one percent goes to
the peasants who grow coca: Sen-
dero Luminoso gets tens of mil-
lions of dollars annually from its
association with the trade.
Though the crops are visible
from the road and air, the govern-
ment is powerless to. eradicate
them. Tarazona-Sevillano pointed
to several different inhibitors, in-
cluding the division of enforce-
ment responsibility between the

police (drugs) and the military.
(terrorism). The fusion of the two
illegal activitics has not led to
similar cooperation between the
two branches of law enforcement.

Another problem is a lack of
alternatives for area, peasants.
“Sendcro Luminoso has definitely
won the hearts and minds of the
peasants in the Huallaga Valley,”
said Tarazona-Sevillano. Though
their percentage of the profits is
liny, its is still more thaf they can
earn on legitimate crops.

Sendero Luminoso positions
itself as the “protectors” of the
coca-growing peasants, fighting
the police and military who try to
eradicate it. Yet the government
fails to implementa crop substitu-
lion program that may lure peas-
ants away from growing coca.

Even though it is the largest
cocaine producing nation; Tara>
zona-Sevillano said the problems
in Peru have been overshadowed
in the drug war by those ia‘Colom-
bia. That changed somewhat after
the recent drug summit in Cart-
agena, Colombia, where the U.S.
approved a $36 million aid pack-
age for Peru. However, the author

anonymous interview, a Davidson
student tells how he raped a stu-
dent in his dorm room after a Pat-
terson Court party. The rape went
unreported. '

“We were both really drunk,
and she said ‘No,’ and I kept coax-
ing her, and finally she didn’t say
no anymore--just laid there. I
thought she had given in. Eventu-
ally we became friends, and the
next thing I know were talking,
and she says something like, ‘Oh

yeah, the night you raped me.’.

What? That’s not what happened-

-not in my mind. I didn’t, Ididn’t
think I had,” he recounts. “Next
she asks me, ‘How would you feel
ifsomeone did that to your sister?”

A poster that he noticed in
Chambers brought home to him
the truth about his actions. “I did
rape her,” he confesses. “I hate
thinking about it. I hate thinking
that I did that to someone. I’m

this, and I know it’s really hard to
