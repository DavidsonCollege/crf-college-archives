BRINKLEY PREDICTS
Fraternities Safe, For Time Being

By GEORGE ALLEN
Staff Writer

Students concerned over
the proposed abolishment of
the fraternity system should
quiet their fears—at least for
from five to 20 years, ac-
cording to Dr. A. B. Brink-
ley.

The blue Sky Subcommit-
fee on Student Life report.
released last week, implies
the gradual end of fraterni-

ties in its proposal for eat-_

ing clubs open to all students.

Brinkley, a subcommittee
member. said that the pro-
posal concerning fraternities
in no way implies the im-
mediate abolishment of the
system at Davidson.

‘The subcommittee pro-
posals,”’ Brinkley said, ‘are
designed for long-range use.
There is nothing in the re-
port to suggest immediate
implementation.”

Brinkley saw several draw-
backs in the present fraterni-
ty system but said that he

was “pleased with the in-
creasing maturity of students
concerning fraternities.”

Dr. James G. Martin, an-
other member of the sub-
committee and a National
Trustee of Beta Theta Pi fra-
ternity, said ‘‘I think the fra-
ternity system plays a vital
role at Davidson College.

Appeal Denied
By Committee

By JIM COOLEY

Staff Writer
The restriction to campus
of a junior found guilty of
possession of alcoholic bev-
erages on campus by the
Faculty Committee on Stu-
dent Discipline was upheld
by the Executive Committee
of the Faculty in an appeal

yesterday afternoon.

Phone
Chairmen
Lose Jobs

Citing ‘‘a number of rea-
sons’ for its action, the col-
lege administration officials
decided this week to discuon-
tinue the use of telephone
chairmen beginning next fall.

In making the announce-
ment to the telephone chair-
men. Mrs. Peter Nicholls.
director of student housing.
said, “After evaluation of the
effectiveness of our present
system and in light of the
changes in service, it has
been decided that the use of
telephone chairmen will be
discontinued.”

Mrs. Nicholls cited the ad-
ditional phones in several of
the dorms as one of the
major reasons. She said that
these phones “have so en-
larged the responsibilities of
the telephone chairmen that
it is impossible to expect the
same duties of them.”

As a result of the decision.
the telephone chairmen have
been given the option of re
signing at the end of the se-
mester, or continuing until
the end of the school year.

The system, initiated about
15 vears ago, was set up to
give financial assistance to
students, by asking them to
answer phones on their dor
mitory halls. In return for
their services, the students
were paid a portion of their
room rent.

According to Dean of Stu-
dents Richard C. Burts. the
Executive .Committee, after
deliberating, decided that the
student's appeal ‘‘didn't have
enough force.”

It was the first appeal of
this nature made to the Exe-
cutive Committee, consisting
of Dean of the Faculty Fron-
tis W. Johnston. who acted
as chairman in President
D. Grier Martin's absence,
Burts, and professors E. F.
Patterson. Bruce Jackson.
Malcolm Lester, George Lab-
ban, Charles Lloyd and W. H.
Frey.

The central point in the
student’s appeal was that he
was not guilty to the degree
that the sentence indicated.
Burts said.

First, the student contend-
ed that he was a victim of
circumstance because he had
no foreknowledge of the
events which took place in
his room before his arrival
and because he thought all
the alcoholic beverage had
been removed from his room
when he discovered it and be-
fore the security officer ar-
rived.

He further contended that
he was punished more sev.
erely than other students
found guilty of similar and
more serious violations.

In a statement to THE
DAVIDSONIAN, the student
said, ‘‘The Executive Com
mittee was extremely effect-
ive and well-organized. but I
feel there was pressure on
them to uphold the decision
of the Faculty Committee.”

He noted further that the
Executive Committee seemed
much more objective in its
decision than the Faculty
Committee on Student Dis-
cipline.

“Although I don’t feel the
decisions of the committees
were entirely fair."’ he said.
“I respect the rules involved
and intend to comply with
them.”’

“It provides a social outlet
for its members and serves
an organizational function in
the programs and speakers
which it sponsors on campus.
It also has a positive influ-
ence on scholarship.”’ he
said.

Although Martin said that
it was unfortunate that some
students are not invited to
join fraternities. but that
since the discriminatory bid-
ding process operates on mu-
tual agreement between
members and pledges, fra-
ternity members are assured
of a close and profitable re-
lationship.

Brinkley emphasized that
the proposal concerning fra-
ternities in the subcommittee
report is only to serve as an
alternative measure for the
fraternity system if, for some
reason, the system fails in
the future both to supplement
and complement social life at
Davidson.

“As long as the IFC (In-

terfraterity Council) and the
fraternity members continue

to make serious efforts to.

solve their own problems,
they will have little faculty
interference,’’ Brinkley said.

He added that the fraterni-
ty system could not possibly
be abolished at this time un-
less another means is found
to meet the social needs of
the student body.

Fate Of Manor
Still Undecided

By JOHN WILLIAMS
Staff Writer

The fate of the Lingle
Manor building is in the
hands of the business office.
President Tom Earnhardt
told the Student Council Mon-
day.

Earnhardt said Robert A.
Currie, treasurer and busi-
ness manager, told him that
Lingle Manor still had un-
paid debts and nothing could
be done with the building un-
til the debts were settled.

Currie said the college

Manor site was chosen, R. S.
Kelly of Erwin, a member of
the Trustee Building and
Grounds Committee, said, “I
didn't want the new library
stuck out there in front of
the dormitories.”

Dr. Chalmers G. Davidson,
director of the library, point-
ed out during the trustee de-
\iberations the advantages of
the Concord Road site.

Advantages he listed were
easy availability between
classes; completion of the
quadrangle formed by the
present library, the south
end of Chambers, and the
Martin Science building: al-
most unlimited room for ex-
pansion and the concealment
of the mass of the building.

Last year a student poll
conducted by the Student
Council indicated that about
90 per cent of the students
voting favored the Concord
Road site, while less than 9
per cent preferred the Lingle
Manor location. The other
one per cent favored the
Guest House site.

"I don’t remember whether
we used the student poll re-
sults in our meting or not.”
Kelly said. He said that the
disadvantages of the Con-
cord Road site were that it
was across the road from
the campus proper and would
be more difficult to reach.

arrangement is infinitely better this
year than it was last year. The avail-
ability of seats both in the mezzanine
and the parquet sections is very good."

“In comparison
to last year, it's much better. How-
ever, when you're sitting on the lower
’ level, your ability to see the entire
game is limited. Overall, it is still

Dave Staton, Junior: “It’s a great
arrangement. For one thing, the stu-
dents deserve the good seats since
it's their team, and the team deserves
the close support. It will probably in-
crease the number of students who -
attend the games there.”

“The end
zone ‘seats were not as bad as they
looked from the diagram of. the Coli-
seum. However, the side seats were
excellent. A better arrangement would
be to eliminate the end zone seats.”

One of the prime criticisms
of the proposed landfill has
been that it would attract
rats to the area and com-
pound Davidson's rat prob.
lem.

“That fear is unfounded,”
said Martin. “It’s an emo-
tional appeal which is unre-
lated to the intended opera-
tion of the sanitary landfill.

“Rats and dogs and other
animals do feed at open and
exposed dumps — of which
there are 167 scattered
throughout the county — and
its our responsibility, in view
of the health hazard and un-
sightly appearance, to estab-
lish and maintain sanitary
landfills,"’ he said.

“Ironically, the undesirable
character of open dumps has
created a misapprehension
with regard to the very pro-
gram designed to eliminate
those dumps,” said Martin.

Davidson Mayor Frank L.
Jackson said, “I don't think
it would be proper for me to
comment on the dump be-
fore it comes up before .the
town council. I wouldn’t want
to comment on that.”

He said he would be glad
to hear reports from the
Freshman Council and other
committees before making
any final decision.

Joe Murphy asked the
council to warn students not
to tamper with the new vend-
ing machines. He said the
company which _ installed
them told him the machines
would be removed if there
was any damage to them.

Murphy said cigarette ma-
chines had been removed in

sounded ‘‘very uncompromis-
ing.”

Earnhardt reminded the
Council that Article IX, Sec-

more stringently enforced in
the future.

Record Accomplishments -

Variety characterizes the
achievements of this year's
Freshman Council.

As Steve Engstom, Fresh- —

man Council president, put
it, ‘We've tried to produce
tangible achievements and at
the same time build a sense
of class spirit.’

“Of course we've had the
regulars — the things that
each council before us has

done — but we've tried to do
more,'' Engstrom added.

He listed as the “‘reguars”
the preparations that the
council made for Freshman
Parents Day. Freshman-
Sophomore Field Day and
Homecoming displays and
skits for the pep rally.

The first major Freshman
Council project was a party

Student Apathy May Cause
Open House Program’s End

Open house, a _ long-time
Davidson tradition, might
come to an end—unless stu-
dent participation increases,
according to Don Hoyt, open
house chairman of the
YMCA.

In a letter to the student
body last Friday, Hoyt noted
a marked increase in partici-
pation in the program by
members of the faculty and
administration and urged
students to do the same.

“If you don't participate.
don’t complain when the pro-
gram is ended."’ he said.

Hoyt and the YMCA began
actively encouraging faculty
and administration members
to hold open house more fre-
qently in mid-October, and
Hoyt said their response has
been “gratifying.”

Attendance at open house
has varied, he said, but in
several instances as many as
25 students have visited a
professor.

However. in most cases at-
tendance has been less than

Smith Appointed

five and several times only
one, Hoyt said.

“Students should realize
that this is a grand oppor-
tunity," Hoyt said. ‘‘They
are not realizing that when
the opportunity ends, they
will squawk.”’

The open house program
began .at Davidson about 20
years ago, according to, Mrs
T. S. Logan. wife of the
Davidson chemistry profes.
sor and secretary to the col-
lege chaplain. But for de-

cades before that. it had been
a custom for students to call
on their professors on Sun-
day nights.

Open house was held right
after vespers, and when re-
guired vespers was ended two
years ago, open house par-
ticipation experienced a
marked decline, Hoyt said.

“Since for so many years
open house was tied up with
vespers, lack of a regular
vespers could only have an
adverse effect.’’ he said.

spirit and providing enter-

‘party earned the class enough

money to initiate other pro-

art, a council member.

The council has arranged
for the installation of tele-
phones on each freshman
hall. It has given its full
support to the Student Coun-
cil's project of providing
more vending. machines in
the dormitories.

Council resolutions have
supported the proposal for a

mas vacation, the élevation
of sailing to varsity-sport

of student identification
cards.

The last proposal was
drawn up after freshmen
complained that college
identifaction cards had’ not
been accepted as a form of
identification at at least one
business establishment.

down at last week's Student.
