Newest F igures Explode Fraternity Court Myth

AN ANALYSIS

¢ By RUSS MERRITT
Associate Editor

ED. NOTE: This is the first in a-
series of four articles on “Frater-
nities In Crisis.”

One of the most pervasive be-
liefs at Davidson is that fraterni-
ties provide the social life for a
vast majority of the student body.

To the defenders of the Dayid-
son fraternity system this belief
has become dogma. In the light of
facts, however, it is nothing more
than myth, and a grossly expound-
ed. and expanded myth at that.

For instance, when the class of
°72 entered Davidson.it was told
He 85 percent of the student

ody was affiliated with the 12
national fraternities on campus.
However, in actuality less than
two-thirds of the campus was at
that time active in fraternities, and
next-fall barely half of the student
body will be paying fraternity
bills.

Court now numbers only 474 ac-
tive members, far less than the
assumed 85 percent, or even the
two-thirds of last year, of the
student body. f

Next year the fraternity court
will begin eperation with approx
imately 538 members, possibly the
fewest in many years. Also, there
will be at least four houses with
fewer than the 30 members re-
quired by the college, with several
more fraternities being in finan-
cial trouble.

In fact, it is apparent to close
observers of the court that Da-
vidson fraternities are gradually
beginning to follow the nation-
wide demise of college fraternities.
As the vice-president of one of
Davidson's largest groups recently
said, “The fraternity system here
is dying and will be dead in a cou-
ple of years if it doesn’t change

from its present patterns.” In
short, then, the fraternities at
Davidson are in the beginning

stages of a-.major crisis.
The court has been attacked
from the outside for years, dating

important

back to a faculty vote outlawing
faternities a decade ago and up
to the latest unsuccessful attempts
by Independents to ruin rush.

Now, however, the problems
are internal and the wounds are
much deeper, and it will apparent-
ly take a drastic change from the
present system to save it from
passing from the Davidson scene.

The reasons for this slow death
of the fraternity system are three-
fold: first, there is a growing dis-
interest among students concern-
ing fraternities, a disinterest pro-
duced by a feeling that fraternities
do not satisfy their social needs;
second, the fraternity ideology,
particularly in the natidnal-local
issue, is under vicious attack from
within the national fraternities;
and third, the changing personal-
ities of the Davidson students have
caused deep personal dissension
in several houses.

The. Kappa Alpha house is a
good example of a fraternity in
trouble. Long one of the foremost

‘fraternities on campus, the KAs

will open next fall with 28 mem-

bers at the most, dccording to
Fred Rose, a brother at the house.
According to Rose, there are just
17 juniors and sophomores now
at the house due to a recent house
division over fraternity philagso-
phy, a division that probably can
not be healed.

“The split in the house came
over the Robert E..Lee tradition
of Kappa Alpha and over the lo-
cal-national issue. Also, there was
a difference in personalities,”
Rose said.

Just before the split, the house
voted by a majority of two to

Stay national and retain the tra-
ditional KA image.

Around 25 inactive KAs partied
together last week, demonstrating
that they did not need the organ-
ized house and did not intend to
return to it as long as it is run
under the current philosophies.

“There is a tremendous amount
of hostility between the KAs on
campus,” Rose said. “People have
been going inactive simply because
they can’t make this fraternity
system work for themselves.”

At the Sigma Nu house the
problem is somewhat different.

All fraternities at some time or
another go beep ap the pains of
losing an outstanding class at grad-
uation, but the Snus were hit par-
ticularly hard last year and will be
hurt even more this spring.

John Cutehin, one of the sopho-
mores at the house, said that the
seniors this year “were great
leaders for the house” and that
their presence greatly influenced
the fraternity’s rushes both last
year and this winter. Graduation

fied members at the Snu house.

‘TO_ CHANGE ATTITUDES’

Earth Day Workers
Car Boycott, Litter

By STEVE CROSS
Copy Editor

The anti-auto  leafleteers,
the, theta-sign . posters, the
cans of plastic cups outside
the Union ,Cafeteria, and the
great heaps of rubbish on the
porch of the Union’ served
notice to all comers Wednes-
day. that Davidson College
had joined the. nation-wide
celebrations of Earth Day.

Davidson’s Earth Day effort
included volunteer squads to
help the Town’ of Davidson
pick ‘up garbage this week,
to clean up litter on the cam-
pus; ‘to pass out leaflets urg-

ing people not to drive cars,
and to distribute information
on the dangers of pollution
both to the college and the
community.

Freshman John Wackman,
one of the leaders of the
movement, explained, that
“the purpose of the Earth
Day is to’ get student par-
ticipation .and involvement,

.and on one day to get some-

thing done.

He added that it would
not be enough just to be
tidy for one day. “‘We want
to change people’s attitudes,”
said Wackman. “This is

The, Artist: Series. program
is handled: by: a committee

ministration. :

At the present time the se-
jecting and booking ‘of «the

of that committee

ardson Professor of Music
Donald: Plott. ‘ahd C. "Shaw
Smith, director of the Col-
lege Union.

These men differ slightly
on the future’ approach to the

‘Artist Series. Smith would

like to see the selection of
the artists controlled by stu-
dents. ; ‘

“The artists should be
chosen and presented by the
students, arid only the con-
tract negotiations ‘should be
handied. by non-students,”
said Smith, who feels that
the faculty could help in an
advisory ‘ capacity, however.

Plott agrees that greater
student involyement would
be beneficial and that >the
faculty role could be reduced
to an advisory one.

«

But because ,of the educa-
cational and cultural obli-
gations of the. Artist Series,
he says,. the faculty com-
mittee should have the right
to veto any selection by a
Student committee that they
felt unwise.

He’ also notes that agents

prefer to deal with .perman-
ent contacts that they can
work with over a number of
years, not students who pass
through in four years.
Smith agrees on this point,

and feels that continuing
contacts should negotiate
with the artist to insure,

among ther things, ‘that stu-

dents don’t get robbed.
Smith, however, leans to-

ward a much greater degree

Whether anyone's attitude

When Instructor of South
Asian Studies Frederick
Gaige drove up to the Jack
son Court entrance on Con-
cord Road, he was approach
ed to buy a sticker for forty
cents.

“Id rather save my, forty
cens for the war issue,” he
said, ‘something with a little
less public support.”

When Associate Professor
of Bible and Religion R. Da-
vid Kaylor rode up ‘on his
bicycle and, was’ offered a
sticker, he said, ‘‘Isn’t it
kind of inconsistent to pass

on cars saying ‘Stamp out
