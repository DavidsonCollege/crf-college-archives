Town Day features
pedal power’ theme

By ESTHER BRUCE
Features Editor
It began at least ten years ago asa
town-wide clean-up campaign. It has
grown to an annual collaboration,
‘complete with games and a parade—
Town Day. ee

The day is sponsored by the Park
and Recreation Committee. Activities
will be located on the Village Green.
Games sponsored by local merchants
will be available, as well as’ various
booths. “The Drama Department will
probably have a make-up booth,”’ said
Nicholls.

A booth could involve almost any
type of thing, and any group is
welcome to have one. ‘‘Any organiza-
tion which wants to have a booth can
certainly do so,’’ Nicholls encouraged.
“We have lots of space.”

The college ‘‘Y’’ has been involved to
various degrees in past years. This year
the group is an active, but not a driving
force. They will run the drinking ‘booth.

The kick-off for the day is the parade
down Main Street at noon. ‘‘Pedal
Power’’ is the theme of this year’s
parade, and says Nicholls, ‘There will
be nothing motorized.’’

Fun, games, and togetherness are
the means and ends of a successful
Town Day. Explained Nicholls, ‘It’s
just sort of a day for the town to get
together.”’

Here is the day’s schedule:

Says Colfége Housing Director Scot-
