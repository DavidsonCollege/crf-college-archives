the Davidson defensive unit.

things about it.

their backs to the wall.

crowd estimated at about a
thousand. Mental lapses de-
fensively seemed to be the
team’s downfall.

Highlights of the game in-
cluded a remarkable diving
save by goalie Doug Schues-
sler, which received a standing
ovation from the crowd, and
the goal late in the second half
by striker Dave Patton.

Two days later the Wildcats
traveled to Chapel Hill for a
match with the University of
North Carolina, who in Coach
Stone’s opinion is the toughest
team on Davidson’s schedule.

After holding them score-

less in most of ‘the first half,
the Wildcats were eventually
defeated by a score of 3-0. The
team looked better both offen-
sively and defensively. Heart-
breaking was the superb shot
by midfielder D.C. Augustine,
called back because of a hands
ball on a Davidson player.
1 Coach Stone feels the team
is going to get better. ‘I think
we.are going to surprise a lot
of people when they look at
our 0-3 record. We are going to
win some games this year.’

The soccer team plays a pair
of games this weekend, both
important Conference games,
against William and Mary in
Williamsburg and VMI in
Lexington. The Wildcats play
their first home game agains

, at Charlotte October 6.
