AVIDSON OVER CAROLINA--COME ON, WILDCATS

CAT TRAX
As They Follow the Red and
Black
By Zeb V. Long, Jr.

It looks like a big jubilee down Richard-
son Field waygabout two-thirty Saturday.
We bet that no three-ring circus in the
country can afford more thrills than the
clash between Carolina’s Tar Heels and
Davidson's Wildcats, and we bet that the
winning team will be ready to acknowl-
edge that it has learned how to fight when
the last horn toots.

We say FIGHT because David-
son must scrap more fiercely than
ever before to win, and the Cats
are out to win. Therefore, we fig-
ure that it is going to require Car-
olina’s best to whip a fighting Da-
vidson team. Time has shown the
Wildcats to be immeasurably bet-
ter against the Blue and White
than against any other team. Age
old rivalry, and the glory of win-
ning from Carolina explain that.
From kick-off to whistle—a battle!

Certainly we know the dope—Carolina
by three and likely four touchdowns. But
we know, too, the spirit rampant in that
Wildcat squad. We've seen them battle
V. M. IL, Clemson, and State to stand-
stills. We've seen 'em improve with every
game until now they are a menace to any
team. We see the squad in prime shape,
we see them rarin’ to go, and so we see
Carolina having eleven thunderbolts on
their hands Saturday.

Home-Coming day should mean
a lot to everybody. It’s the one
time: of the year that visitors in
large numbers see the heart of the
school uncovered. The entertain-
ment billed to attract the crowds
is football, but football with Caro-
lina is more than just a game. It’s
a tradition founded on years and
years or fierce, scrappy fighting.
Davidson goes into a Carolina
game with new ardor and deter-
mination—new spirit. That’s why
there’s always a chance—a real
chance—to win. That’s why thou-
sands of Wildcat supporters are
going to feel confident and opti-
mistic on Saturday. You can’t lick
a fighting team—not in the true
sense of the word. If the score
goes against a team that is giving
its best, then nobody has ground
for complaint.

Carolina is bringing a carload of lumi-
naries to the hill. Captain Schwartz,
prominent candidate for all-southern hon-
ors; Schuler, Sapp, Jackson, Ward, and
others. This crew broke Georgia Tech's
line with the first the year
against the Engineers, and has been a con-
sistent threat to every opponent.. Heavy
and fast, they will be hard to handle.

score of

There are no regrets about the
State game except that unfortu-
nate blast of Dick Carrington’s
whistle. See what a little bit of
wind can do! Flinn was long gone
toward the tying touchdown, and
his interference was accompanying
him in a business like manner. Car-
rington is*a good referee, and, in
spite of the result, we can’t hold
him guilty for his decision. . He
just missed an important point,
that’s all.

That “thin red line” is doing pretty well,
most people think. Those big backs on
Gus Tebell’s team found the going rather
rough, ¢gspecially in the second half. Their
gains were few. Harper and Smith are
digging in and under from their guard
positions, afd are holding like they mean
it. Not the sort of holding that draws 15
yards, however! We look for young
Riggs McConnell to give the vaunted
Schwartz all he can stand. Riggs is play-
ing a wonderful game at center, and is in-
tercepting passes like a center ought to.

We are, glad to see Dan Left
wich coming inte his own after
two years of pretty hard luck. Dan
is going great guns, and his weight
is a power to that little line. Bill
Archie and Captain Baker are al-
so strutting their WARES IN DE-
CISIVE STYLE.

The Brothers Bradshaw and Company,
better known as the Davidson Fresh foot-
ball team, gave State’s yearlings a treat,
and, by reports, ran off with everything
but the goalposts, and passed until they
felt like sprouting wings. -Naturally we
congratulate “Cap” Goodson and his ag-

Tying Score for Davidson Ruled
Illegal by Officials—Flinn
Sprints Fifty Yards

Playing their best game of the season,
the Wildcats held the strong Wolfpack to
a touchdown victory in Greensboro Sat-
urday. While State had the edge virtually
the entire route, their margin was slight
and the battle wasn’t over until the final
whistle blew. It took everything State
possessed in the way of football to eke put
a 14-7 victory. But for a referee’s un-
timely toot of his whistle, the score might
‘have been knotted. Dick Flinn, after a
wonderful exhibition of — side-stepping,
plunging and nifty running, crossed the
State goal-line only to have the ball called
back, the referee having blown his whistle
‘in the midst of the play.

All the scoring was done in the first
half of the game, the final periods being a
nip and tuck affair with the lines of both
teams playing great defensive ball. The
game was {poi roughness, with the big
majority of the penalties falling to the
State team. But through it all the light
Davidson team cam through in fine
shape, no serious injury being suffered.

For 50 per cent of the first quarter the
two ‘elevents engaged in a punting duel,
with Brock getting the better of’ Warren
in the exchange. Toward the middle of
this period Warren broke through the Da-
vidson line for a 40-yard run, being hauled
down by Flinn on Davidson's 20-yard line.
Two line plays failed, after which Warren
tossed a pass to Silver, who crossed the
Wildcat goal line for the first score of
the game. Adams added the extra point
with a perfect dropkick.

Early in the second quarter the Wild-
cats knotted the score with an overhead
attack. Taking the ball on their 25-yard
line, they opened up. One pass was
grounded, but the next was ruled complete
when Kell was interfered with while at-
tempting to receive it. This put the ball
on State’s 45-yard line. Kell tossed an-
other pass which struck Adams, State's
safety man, and bounded into a bunch of
charging ‘Cats. Riggs McConnell grab-
bed it out of the air and sold out for
State's goal line, but was stopped on their
five-yard line. Flinn took it over in three
line plays and Brock added the extra point
with a placekick. The final score of the
game came soon after. Crum ran the
kickoff back to the 45-yard line, a line play
netted four for State, and then Warren
broke through the entire Davidson’ team
for a 45-yard run and touchdown.
‘Adams again added the extra point with
a dropkick.

This ended the scoring for the day and
trom then on it was a close battle. It was
during the final period that Flinn made
the illegal touchdown,

For State the outstanding player was
Warren, and it was due to his work pri-
marily that State secured the verdict.
Metts for State and McConnell for Da-
vidson staged a real battle at center, with
the Wildcat getting the better of the ar-
gument. Brock at end and Leftwich at
tackle were the other Davidson linemen

line in fine style and Flinn made several

Davidson-Carolina
In Annual Struggle

Powerful Tar Heel Team Here
For Home-Coming Day
Battle

The real event for Homecoming Day is
the traditional. and famous Davidson-
Carolina grid battle. Two-thirty Satur-
day afternoon will find the Wildcats and
the Tar Heels lined up waiting for the
kickoff to start one of North Carolina’s
gala football classics. Carolina is doped
to win the tilt—some say that the Tar
Heels will win handily, possibly by two or
three touchdowns; but then what is dope
where a bunch of fighting ‘Cats are con-
cerned? Too often this well-known bucket
has been turned over by the Wildcats for
the “dopsters” to be taken seriously. At
any rate, Mank’s boys are expected to give
the vaunted Tar Heels all they can handle.

Coach Collins’ outfit comes to Davidson
with at least two things, which, in the
opinion of many, would be a ‘credit to al-
nost any team—a gallant stand against the
unconquerable Jackets of Georgia Tech,
and a certain mustached pivot man who
is captain of the squad, Harry Schwartz, |
