days due to a flu epidemic which

The Education Policy Com-
mittee reviewed core curriculum.

Over 200 Davidson men regis-

This term, the Student Un-
ion’s Cinema Classics program
will be presenting films from all
tones of tastes, all walks of life,
and-all-genres of artistry. From
film greats such as Cary Grant
and John Wayne to the great di-
rectors of International cinema
suchas Jean Renoir (the painter’s
son, a great filmmaker) and Max
Ophuls (asublime visionary), the
Cinema Classics program has a
wide variety of delectable flicks.
Here are justa few of the treats to
come:

I Was a Male War Bride
(1949), directed by Howard
Hawks, starring Cary Grant and
Anne Sheridan. This is perhaps
my favorite American film; it is
certainly one of the greatest (and
wildest) of American comedies.
Grant starts as Henri Rochard, a
French (believe it or not) lieuten-
ant stationed in Germany in the
years immediately after World
War II, who gets mixed up in a
seemingly doomed marriage with
Anne Sheridan’s Catherine, an
American army officer. Dark
comedy reigns when the bureau-
cratic red tape of Hawks’ U.S.
Army comes between the newly-
wed’s future happiness. In addi-
tion to the high spirit of the film,
delighted audiences will witness
some of the most poetic photog-
raphy of the German landscape
A must. Coming January 24th
and.27th, 1

Leibelei (1932), director Max
Ophuls. February brings the first
of a series of German films from
the Weimar Republic of the
1930s; Leibelei is the work of a
master. Set in the 19th century,
this is a profound tale of loye,
fate, and death based on a Ger-
man story about a:military offi-

cer and his newfound true love,
an aspiring opera singer.
(‘“Leibelei” means, in German,
the loved ones.) Certainly aunique
statement on the mysterious na-
ture of human fates-and desires is
made in this subtle work, a state-
ment achieved through lyrical
camera work and finely tuned
performances. Showing February
3rd.

Also showing in February is
The Golden Coach, the work of
Jean Renoir, painter Pierre Au-
guste’sson. This 1952 film places
Italian star Anna Magnanni in the
role of a diva of a troupe of wan-
dering minstrels (circa 18th cen-
tury) who have traveled from the
stages of Spain to a South Ameri-
can colony in hopes of fame
abroad. Magnanni finds favor with
all the important men of.the col-
ony, but she seems to desire a
certain Golden Coach recently
acquired by the Grand Duke more
than any man’s love. Renoir’s film
is a comic portrayal of greed and
love. A truly spirited classic.
Showing February 7th.and 10th.

In later weeks of the term,
look out for Duke Wayne, Dean
Martin, and Ricky Nelson in the
greatest of American Westerns,
Rio Bravo, where the bad men
fight the coolest of all possible
good men while the “Rollin’ Rio
Bravo rolls along.” And, in addi-
tion to more films from Germany
and a few: more. French “‘visual
poems”, cinema buffs.can take in
some of America’s best come-_
dies, including the original farce
about the craftiest actors to ever
escape Nazi-occupied Poland, To
Be or Not To Be. (You can see
Jack Benny, that late great come-
dian, try his hand at the role of
Hamlet.) Keep:your eyes open,
then, to Cinema Classics this term.

Be Aware Of Food
Safety Tips

By Sue Reade
Ignoring basic food safety rules
can set you up ‘for food-bome ill-
ness, Even if you don’t cook your
own meals, you probably keep
some food in your dorm room and
you should be aware of preventive
measures. =
Keep Food Bacteria Free.
Make sure utensils, counter tops,
and hands have been cleaned with
soap and hot water. Rinse meat,
poultry, and fish with water before
cooking. Avoid spreading bateria
through cross contamination (wash
utensils and cutting boards in be-
tween foods).

Keep Food Hot. Most bateria

are killed during cooking. Cook
meat thoroughly. If food sits un-
heated for two hours or longer,

Freeze leftovers or use them within
48 hours.

“Keep Food Cold. Refrigera-
tortemperatures should be less than
40 degrees Fahrenheit. Thaw fro-
zen food in the refrigerator over-
night, or under cold running water.

Several bacteria are responsible
for food-borne illnesses. A com-
mon culprit is found mainly in raw
animal products: red meat, poul-
try, and eggs. Symptoms include
diarrhea, abdominal cramps, vom-
iting, and fever.

Botulism is a rare but poten-
tially fatal form of food poisoning.
Preventive measures include dis-
carding cans that leak or bulge,
throwing out foods with off odors,
as well as those measures previ-
ously mentioned.
