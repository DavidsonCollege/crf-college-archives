The fast lane to victory:

_ On behalf of the Wildcat women swim-
mers, Britta Toleman proclaimed “We're not
going to let them bet us in our house.” And
they didn’t.

For the fourth consecutive year the lady
Wildcats claimed the Southern States Cham-
pionships. In front of a packed - house of
screaming, flag waving, face painting, and
noise-maker shaking fans the Wildcats racked
up 756.5 points en route to a 38.5 point
victory over second-place finisher Univer-
sity of Louisville. : a

The Wildcats, who finished the regular
season 7-4, shot out of the blocks in this
year’s championships, establishing a thirty-
point cushion in Thursday’s events. Despite
the early lead, head coach Rich DeSelm said
this was one of the most competitive South-
ern States in recent history.

“After the [Saturday] morning session
we could have lost,” DeSelm noted. “I don’t
think with a 50 point lead they fully compre-
hended that it would be a close meet in the
end.”

DeSelm and his coaching staff gathered
the team together and told them that if they
failed to improve on their earlier times Lou-
isville would win the meet.

Co-captains and seniors Britta Toleman
and Beth Wilson inspired their teammates
emotionally.

“This is our house,” Toleman told her
teammates, “We’re no going to let them beat
us and take away our championship.”

The Wildcats responded to the challenge.

“We were on fire,” Toleman said. “Our
victory was a response to pressure.”

“(Louisville) could have easily overtaken
us, but everyone stepped up so amazingly,”
added senior Suzzi Bozzone.

“This year’s win was really earned,”
DeSelm said. “This was one of the best team
efforts and example of determined spirit that
Ihave been involved with in a championship
meet.”

The senior factor:

Davidson’s ten senior swimmers have
known.-nothing but Southern States victory
over their careers--and they succeeded in
keeping it that way.

“Every senior has been on fire all sea-

son,” Toleman said. “We’re a really tight .

group and we didn’t want to let that fourth
championship slip away.”

“The seniors really wanted to win four in
arow and everybody worked so hard through-
out the meet to make that possible,” said
senior Mary Shell Brosche.

Brosche, who was named Southern States
swimmer of the meet for the third time, domi-
nated her opponents in this year’s champion-

Mary Shell Brosche, a senior from Ander-
son, S.C., set two individual records in last
weekend’s Southern States Championships.
She was also the lead swimmer for the

recording-setting 400 Medly Relay team.

ships, earning victories in the 200 yard back-
stroke and individual medley, and the 400
yard individual medley. The senior from
Anderson, S.C. also helped Davidson edge
out the University of Louisville by .96 of a
second in the 400 yard medley relay.
Brosche, a perpetual member of the all
Southern-States team, has never lost a 200
yard backstroke, 200 yard individual medley,
or a 400 yard individual medley over her
Southern States career. This year she set

* personal and meet records in the 200 and 400

yard individual medley and narrowly missed
setting a record in the 200 yard backstroke.

Toleman helped set a new school record
as she powered the second leg of the victori-
ous 400 yard medley relay team as well as
garnering third-place finishes in the 200 yard
medley relay and the 100 yard breastroke,

“As you get older it’s harder to swim
faster,” Toleman said. “I was so excited to
end like that here at home. It was an exciting
weekend individually, but it came from the
group effort.”

Davidson’s never-ending supply of se-
nior talent also included Rachel Horak, Karen
Fritchie, Jennifer Howard, Beth Wilson, and
diver Elizabeth Fraser.

Howard and Horack joined Brosche and
Toleman to swim the third and fourth legs of
the 400 yard medley relay--a race in which
Davidson’s all-senior foursome beat the Uni-
versity of Louisville, adding 40 key points to
the Wildcat total. Horak also led the Wildcats
to a third-place finish in the 200 yard medley
relay, while Howard claimed second in the
100 yard butterfly.

Fritchie and Wilson, the team’s co-cap-
tain and most-improved swimmer, earned

vidual medley and 100 yard breastroke.

“Fritchie had the meet of her life,”
DeSelm said. “She blew away her best times
at Davidson.”

In the diving competition, Fraser fin-
ished a respectable eighth in both the one-
and three-meter events.

“Elizabeth had her best performance
ever,” DeSelm said. “She is the first diver to
dive all four years and is the rock of our
diving program.”

Rising talent

Davidson’ rising talent certainly rose to
the occasion at Southern States.

“Every single girl had an amazing meet,”
Toleman said. “Beth Summerlin and Tonya
Werner did what they had to
do in the 200 Back and Heidi
Hester beat two Louisville
swimmers in the mile.”

Sophomore Kendra |
Berner of Lake Bluff, Ill.
proved key in the Wildcats’
relay victories, anchoring
Davidson’s come-from-be-
hind win in the 400 yard
freestyle relay and the
team’s third place finish in
the 200 yard medley. Indi-
vidually, Berner claimed
second in the 200 yard_
freestyle event and swam a
personal best in the 500
freestyle.

“Kendra is a vicious
competitor.” DeSelm said.
“She loves to race and al-
ways races to win. She al-
ways finishes with a strong

fifth place finishes in both the 200 yard indi-

“Kendra and all the underclassmen
worked so hard throughout the whole meet,”
Brosche said. .

Summerlin may be Brosche’s successor
in the individual medley and backstroke
events. The sophomore swam a lifetime best
in the 200 yard backstroke and fell just short:
of her lifetime best in the 400 yard individual
medley..

“It’s fantastic to have a talented
backstroker and individual medley swim-
mer,” DeSelm said. ““She’s a great competi-
tor.”

~ Junior Elissa’ Weddle also performed
well in the consolation final of the 100 yard
freestyle.

“She’s a very consistent and dependable
sprinter,” DeSelm described.

Sophomore diver Liz Nugent set acham-
pionship recrod in the three-meter event on
Thursday night, and finished fourth overall.

Earlier in the season, Nugent qualified
for the NCAA zonal competition for the
second consecutive year.

“Liz is an amazing athlete,” said
Toleman.

“The diving program has come*a long
way,” said Fraser. “The performance of the
women at this meet is a testament to the
growth and achievement of this program.”

Looking Ahead

So far, the Wildcats have accomplished
all of their pre-season goals: they finished the
season with a winning record, beat Duke
University at a dual meet, and won their
fourth consecutive Southern States Champi-
onship. According to DeSelm, all that is left
to do is perform well at the ECAC meet.
