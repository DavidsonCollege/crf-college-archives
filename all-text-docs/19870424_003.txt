Two ex-diplomats will speak at Davidson

By NELLE McCORKLE

Former U.S. Ambassador to
the United Nations Jeanne
Kirkpatrick and Arkady Shev-
chenko, the highest-ranking
Soviet ever to defect, will speak at
Davidson on May | and May 6 re-
spectively.

Kirkpatrick will address
“Problems and Challenges of
American Foreign Policy”; Shev-
chenko will examine “The United
States and the Soviet Union under
Gorbachev.” The Dean Rusk Pro-

gram in International Studies will :

sponsor both lectures.

“I believe we are lucky to haye
two headline figures in interna-
tional affairs come to our campus’
within a few days of each other,”
Dean Rusk Program Director Jack
Perry said. ‘

“Both come from careers at
the U.N. — but with totally dif-
ferent perspectives,” Perry said.
“Mrs. Kirkpatrick was the U.S.
representative and is a leading
conservative spokesman on for-
eign policy. Shevchenko defected
from the U.S.S.R. and is now giv-
ing the West his sharp insights
into Saoviet foreign policy. The
combination is aremarkable one.”

Kirkpatrick belongeu to Presi-
dent Reagan’s Cabinet for four
years prior to her 1985 resigna-
tion. She currently teaches politi-
cal science at Georgetown Uni-
versity and serves as an American
Enterprise Institute senior fellow.

Reagan Phenomenon and The
New Presidential Elite. The first

women were Barnard freshmen.
De Lattre and Kirkpatrick became
friends and later roommates at
Columbia. “Mrs. Kirkpatrick has
a very, very sharp mind which she
combines with a very deep culture
and first-hand knowledge of
things that are going on in the
world,” de Lattre said.

De Lattre called Kirkpatrick

eign policy. “She’s been thinking
about these problems for the last
30 years or so,” according to de
Lattre.

‘ Perry noted Kirpatrick’s polit-
ical potential. “I’ve heard her
mentioned as a possible Republi-
can vice-presidential nominee,”

he said.

Shevchenko left the Soviet

Shevchenko worked for the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency for three
years prior to his defection.

While serving in the Foreign
Service, Perry met Shevchenko.
“I got to know Arkady in

into the Soviet system really fas-
cinating. He. knew all the Soviet
leaders from Brezhnev to, Gor-
bachev, and he knows how the
Politburo operates. For my

On Tuesday, a bomb which had been
planted by Tamil guerillas exploded in a
bus terminal in Columbo, Sri Lanka, kil-
ling 150 people and wounding 200. Gov-
ernment planes bombed the rebels on
Wednesday as they attacked government
forces, adding more than 100 causulties
to a death toll that has reached 400 in the
past six days. Minority Tamil separatists
have been waging a four year guerilla war
to establish an independent country.

Karl Linnas was deported to the
Soviet Union on Monday to face a death
sentence. Linnas was charged with run-
ning a Nazi concentration camp, and
overseeing the deaths of over 2000
people during World War II.

One of the Soviet Union’s largest
newspapers published an ex-convict’s

denounciation. of the Soviet Union’s
labor camps. As a result of Gorbachev's

policy of ‘glasnost’, government-con-
_ trolled papers in the Soviet Union have

begun to allow criticisms of the govern-

ment to be published. as.
Rival PLO factions made peace on

Monday, and called for the establishment

of a Palestinian homeland with Jeruselem:

as its capital. The organization had been
split since 1983, when dissidents broke
with PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat.
The first successful penetration of Is-
rael’s heavily guarded northern border in

four years occured on Sunday. Three -

Palestinian guerillas, intent of seizing
hostages, slipped past Israeli security and
killed two soldiers before they them-
selves were killed.

On Friday, a high ranking arms con-
trol official said that the U.S. and the
Soviet Union may conduct underground

nuclear tests at each others sites as a first
step towards improved verification.

During his meeting with Secretary of
State George Schultz on Tuesday, Gor-
bachev suggested the elimination of all
short range nuclear weapons and all inter-
mediate range weapons in Europe.
Though Schultz was said to have rejected
the offer during the meeting, he has been
optimistic about it in public.

At least six black railway workers
were killed in South Africa on Wednes-
day in clashes with police. 16,000 rail-

~ way workers were dismissed for ignoring

a deadline to end their strike.
Across the Nation

the Iran-contra incident voted unani-
mously to grant limited immunity to
former National Security Adviser John
Poindexter, who had previously refused
to testify at the investigation.

Reagan rejected Japan’s request to re-
move recently imposed U.S. sanctions
on electrical products from Japan. The
action came after Japan had rejected a
U.S. proposal for loosening Japanese re-
strictions on U.S. agricultural products.

On Tuesday, the Supreme Court
ruled that a criminal who played a major
role in a crime and displayed “reckless in-
difference to human life” could properly
receive the death penalty.

A panel of the nation’s leading phys-
icists reported that it would take at least a
decade of research before they could de-
cide whether the development of SDI-
type weaponry is possible.

On Wednesday, the Supreme Cour:
ruled that individuals convicted of mu:
der may be put to death, in spite of the
existence of statistical evidence indicat
ing that racial bias often helps determin:
who receives the death penalty.

they chose to play for Greer in-
stead. He was able to generate in-
terest from alumni and from the
athletic administration. The result
was an increased budget. It ena-
bled Greer to purchase the equip-
ment he needed (e.g. a batting
cage and a pitching machine). It

was a great help with the quality of .

practice and in recruiting new
players.

George Greer was lured away
from Davidson by an impressive
offer from Wake Forest. Greer
commented that, “not only was
the financial offer good, but so
were the job conditions.” What

_Greer meant by job conditions

was that the environment was per-
fect for baseball. Wake Forest has
recently shown a tremendous
amount of interest in their baseball
program. A one million dollar

stadium has been started. Wake

will now offer thirteen full schol-
arships which will help Greer get
talented players. Davidson, with-
out the resources of Wake Forest,
obviously cannot and will not
have such a large scale program in
the future. In addition, he will be
coaching in one of the most pre-
stigious conferences in the coun-
try; Davidson does not have a con-
ference. _

Kit Morris considers David-
son “fortunate to have had a Geo-

rge Greer. But the-right opportu-

nity came along, and he took it. |

Now the task of finding a capable
replacement is upon us.” Morris
has a few candidates in mind, but
would not say, for the record, who
they were. He did say that the new
coach would not be just “any-
body,” but a “baseball man, a cap-
able manager of both human and
fiscal resources.” Morris does not
want the program to slip and is
taking serious steps to ensure its

continued success.

Before leaving, George Greer
wanted to thank the people of
Davidson. “I appreciate the: kind
words people have said about the
team since I’ve been here.” He
also wanted to thank Kit Morris
for his “generous support of the
baseball program” and Jamie
May, the Alumni Director, and
Sandy Carnegie of the Wildcat
Club for their help in generating
alumni interest in the team.
