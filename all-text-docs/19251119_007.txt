Wildkittens Leave for

Final Game at Clemson

This afternoon Coach Monk Mattox will
carry his squad of Wildkittnes on an invasion
of South Carolina, to enoounter the Clem-
son Freshmen. A nip and tuck affair is cer-
tain as both teams are light and speedy.
Neither has torn the world asunder with its
victories this year. Their lack of weight has
probably had a great deal to do with this.
As far as games won and lost are concerned,
both are even, having won one and dropped
three, Comparative score are few and far
between but what is to be had indicates that
the Clemson new, boys have a slight edge. |
The hope has been upset too often this sea-}
son to depend upon it, however.

with no major injuries and are in fine fettle
for the Clemson go. The team has been
handicapped greatly hy injuries during for-
mer games. James has developed into a fine
punter and Wenberg showed that he was
extremely heady in the State game. From
the above it can be gathered that if the
Freshmen do not come out with a win they

will miss it by only a small margin.

SCRIBES AGREE THAT DAVID-
SON PLAYED GREAT

The Davidson Wildcats lost their hopes
for the state championship by bowing to
the powerful Carolina eleven Saturday,
but they came back home with a world
of honor showered on their broad and
modest shoulders.

things the sometmes eryptic Ben Dixon

to say in his story of the game:
