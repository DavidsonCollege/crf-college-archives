Administrative offices relocate to perimeter houses

By NELLE MCCORKLE

Three administrative depart-
ments recently moved from first
floor Chambers following Space
Committee recommendations.

These relocations are Alumni
Relations/Annual Fund to
McConnell House and College
Relations Office to Copeland
House during the past two weeks;
the Physical Plant Office relo-
cated to Jackson Court in August.

Removal of these offices per-
mitted the creation of aclassroom,
a seminar room and ten faculty of-
fices.

Within Chambers the former
first floor faculty/staff mailroom
as an Admissions Office slide
show area; the mailroom now op-
erates from the basement. .

Appointed by President John
Kuykendall, the Space Commit-

*,

Fetchin’ Bones arrives

tee consists of psychology profes- and Dean of Students as examples that'll be the case with the senior -

sor and Associate Dean of the Fac-
ulty John Kelton, Vice President
for Development and Institutional
Advancement John Griffith, and
Director of Facilities Planning
Grover Meetze, Jr.

Following this committee’s
recommendations Kuykendall de-

cided to make the suggested

changes. “It [creation of “new
academic area within Chambers]
reflects the highest of the capital
priorities for the Strategic Plan-

_hing Committee for capital plan-
ning,” Kuykendall said. “This ad-
ministrative diaspora will con-
tinue gradually.”

Eventual removal of adminis-
trative offices not directly related
to academics from Chambers is

«planned, but Kuykendall cited the
Registrar, Dean of the Faculty,

of offices expected to remain in
the building.

“This would imply eventually
some sort of separate administra-
tion building for the coliege -in
which the major administrative
offices would be gathered in one
place. That's in the dreaming
Stage because we have no idea
what or where this building will be
or whether it will be a renovated or
a new building,” he said.

_ Director of Alumni Relations
and Annual Fund Jamie May said
of his department’s new setting,
“First of all, we now don’t have an
office — we have an alumni
house, so it’s more than an office.
The fact that the Alumni Associa-
tion and the Annual Fund are in
the same building will make for
easier coordinating between the
two.”

Asked whether he anticipated

decreased student contact due to .

‘separation from the main class-
room building , May responded, “I
would expect a more effective,
substantial relationship than the
drop-in relationship we had in
Chambers. Particularly I think

Davidson College was an im-
portant factor in the decision to
build a Holiday Inn in nearby
Cornelius, according to States
Lee, project coordinator of real
‘estate development for Crescent
Land and Timber, the develop-
ers of the motel. 4.

-The project at the intersec-
tion of Catawba Avenue and I-
77 began during the summer,
and a building permit was at-
tained Sept. 3 at which time con-
‘struction. began. The projected
opening date for the motel is
-April 1, 1987.

“We felt that it was a good
use of the property,” said Lee.
“There is no hotel between
Statesville and Charlotte except
for the Comfort Inn at Sunset
Road, and we felt, there, was a
market for it. With the Lake

class who'll have this house as the

———headquarters for the senior class

gift and class banquet.

“When the Alumni Associa-
tion learned that it was the presi-
dent’s intention to restore first
floor Chambers to its academic
function, Alumni Association
President William Davis '60
asked for McConnell House,
which we considered to be the
most hospitable and gracious of
the perimeter houses.”

Built in 1914 for history and:
economics professor and Dean of
Faculty Joseph McConnell, the
house has served as student hous-
ing since 1983. Structural changes

. for its first use as a non-residence

include construction of a wooden
deck and glass enclosure of a
porch. Twice the square footage

of the Alumni Association and.

Annual Fund’s former quarters,
the McConnell location provides
space for entertaining and small
meetings, according to Assistant
Alumni Director Cissi Fulenwider
Lyles.

Also now possessing twice its
former working area, the College

(Norman) traffic, Davidson
College and Duke Power that
has several employees coming in
a couple of times a year to
McGuire Nuclear Station along
with the North-South traffic, we.
thought it would be a viable
hotel site, and I hope it will be a
good investment.”

Preston Page, Cornelius’
town administrator, said he
thought Davidson College had
little to do with the decision to
build the motel in Cornelius.

“It’s a busy intersection with
a lot of-traffic. Duke Power was
real important in the decision..
Davidson College had nothing
to do with it as far as I know, but
I’m sure they looked at all their
possible customers,” Page said.

The motel will consist of 120
rooms, @ restaurant, a lounge,
meeting rooms and a lobby. Lee

Relations Office anticipates a
slightly changed relationship with
students because of its new set-
ting. According to Director of
College Relations Jerry
Stockdale, “We were right in the
mainstream, and we are po
longer. But having said that, I
don’t think it will be detrimental.
We want students to come to us,
and we do have a number of work-
study students, but contact with
the general student body is not
crucial to our operation.

“We would like to establish
stronger ties with The Davidso-
nian and with Quips and Cranks,
but that’s not related to our move:
we wanted to do that anyway. We
feel we can be a resource to them,
since we’ re in the business of writ-
ing, editing, and publishing for

» the college.”

Stockdale mentioned possible
-cooperation among college publi-
cations in use of the newly-con-
structed Copeland House dar-
kroom.

Copeland House will also
serve as headquarters for organi-
zation ‘of sesquicentennial: pro-

‘Holiday Inn breaks ground

said he thought the motel would
have places available for social
events if the need arose. He esti-
mated that rooms would cost be-
tween $45-50 per night for a
double.

Jane French of the Guest
House said she thinks the Holi-
day Inn is a Welcome addition to
the Davidson-Cornelius com-
munity.

“We're delighted they’re
coming,” said French. “We (at
the Guest House) certainly have
problems trying to house every-
one. Very often, rooms are re-
served by the President’s Office
and the Dean’s Office before we_.
can get to the students. We have
about 50 trustees and only eight
rooms so what do we do then? I
think it’s great that they won’t
have to go so far ‘to find a
motel.” °
