JOURNALISTIC DEPARTMENT .... A last
fling and then the dying emba’s once brilliant
light fades. The emba which consisted in the
worthy idea of having a journalistic course in

again with the greater Davidson of 1987.

Prediction number one: Elevators were in-
stalled in New Chambers March 24, 2000. The
money was donated by a Davidson graduate,
who is one of the pillars of the Republican

dents attending classes on the tenth floor.

servative student body should carry a consid-
erable weight in swinging our work along
more modern lines.

[ Cannas Comments

Davidson College is one of a very few col-
leges which has no college-controlled dining
hall or cafeteria. When we came here it was
our impression that the competition among
local boarding houses kept the fare good and
the cost low, but it has been our experience
that on the whole the statement is not true.
At some boarding houses the fare is good and
at others the cost is low; the two do not go
together. The college has no control over
local boarding houses; they have no kind of
supervision or inspection. We eat what is
given us, hope it is a well-balanced meal, and
trust that it is clean. Some of the boarding
houses are convenient to the campus, others
are very inconvenient, especially when it is
raining or snowing,

On the other hand there may be a good
many support themselves in
whole or in part by running boarding houses.
These people would be seriously inconven-
ienced if the college opened its own dining
hall and required all students to eat there.
Phen, too, there might be a tendency to make
the dining hall show a profit at the expense of
the quality, variety, or quantity of the food.
More than one college has staged a strike
against the food of the dining hall, but if it
were patterned after those at Swarthmore or

families who

Rollins it should be entirely satisfactory.

It is quite possible for the college to use the
banquet hall in Chambers for a dining hall.
It would not hold us all at one time, perhaps,
but that necessary? Breakfast could be
served from 7:30 to 9:30, lunch from 11:00 to
2:00, and dinner from 6:00 to 8:00. By hav-
ing meals served over several hours the entire
student body could be accommodated easily.
No one of us likes to jump and run to a meal
when a bell rings, anyway.

1s

We would suggest that instead of stopping
all classes at 12:30 for lunch they continue
straight through until 2:00 At watever time
a student had a vacant period between 11:00
and 2:00 he could eat his lunch. Fi

Detailed plans would, of course, have to be
worked out by the faculty, and, let us hope,
with some suggestions from the students

Another improvement in this connection
would concern announcements. In the din-
ing hall all announcements could be posted or
read so as to be available to all, thus freeing
our chapel service from the noise and con-
fusion which follows that brief religious
service and which is so sharply in contrast
with it. J

There should be no objection to a change
which will bring us better food and well-
balanced meals at reasonable prices. If there
is to be any effort to make money out of the
scheme, we are solidly opposed to it, but if
properly done we are heartily in favor of it.

ball and Basketball, to write the next Cam-

Stolen Thunder

By DAYMOND TURNER

Thought of the Week ...

A sensible girl is not so sensible
as she looks because a sensible girl
has more sense than to look sensi-
ble . . First one takes a sippi, then
another sippi and the first one to
mississippi is a sissy.

Gone...

When I asked her to wed

“Go to father,” she said.
She knew that I knew

That her father was dead.
She knew that I knew

What a life he had led.
She knew that I knew

What she meant when she said,
“Go to father!”

—Lampoon.

Chaff ...

An honorary degree is one con-
ferred on a man who has proved
he can win without it... Femmes

Once again ha§ the Junior Class
spoken, and the speaking was a
wow. Friday night’s mask ball was
the event of the season. .With its
vari-colored balloons, serpentine,
masks, and girls (mot vari-colored)
set a new high in colorful events—
or so they tell me. I couldn’t see
through my mask myself. But from
intermission on through the week-
end everybody saw, heard, and did
a lot. Little mention has _ been
made of the dance committee itself,
most of the credit being misdirected
at the class as a whole. So here
let us doff our masks to the boys
who did the work. Nice going!

pee ey

Mellen’s Melodeers showed the
Doubting Thomases a thing or three
and were especially good with their
imitations of other leading bands.
The ball room was a bit crowded,
it’s true, but if sardines can take it,
why can’t we? The green lights
gave everybody the GO signal, and
everybody WENT to town in high.
Now that we've all come back to
school in low, ‘though, we can look
forward to the holidays, and beyond
them to the Bowery Brawl. So it
looks like a good spring.

oes

Speaking of spring, this is one
year the weather and the calendar
ran together. Saturday night was
the official last hour of winter, and
Sunday gave the new seafon a
break by breaking all tradition and
providing a burst of sun. Which
put a new spring in everybody’s
walk, by the way. Now let's see
it last through the holidays.

Scripts and Pranks blossomed
forth on the hill in springtime garb
last week, for the first time in its
history on schedule. From the bird
on the front (probably symbolical
of the bird it expected to receive
from its readers) to the Camel ad
on the back, it lived up to its rep-
utation. (You can take that any
way you want to). Incidentally, the
campus poll” Was” Giie” Of the most”
interesting features our magazine
has ever had; looks like our poor
Freshmen, get corrupted during
their four year stay. But don’t
take that too seriously. Maybe
they only learn to tell the truth

about their habits.

The new Davidson catalog, men-
tioned here before, reveals, on
further examination, that the
Treasurer wasn't fooling about
that damage fee proposition he

made to the students some weeks
ago. No mention is made of any
charge for it. This is something
that should make every Davidson
man swell just a bit with pride. De-
spite past lapses on our part, the
administration has been willing to
accept our word on a matter where ~
our breaking that word would
cost them a good many dollars. As
the College President recently ob-
served, “You can depend on the
students to do the right thing nine
times out of ten if they take time
to think it over.”

—o—

While we're in a somewhat se-
rious vein, it is not out of place to
mention the recent Spring Serv-_
ices. It is a far-sighted group that
secures young men exclusively for
the services we have on the hill
each spring and fall. While the old-
er speakers may have’ the same
message, they certainly do not have
the same receptive audience that
greets a younger man. Maybe it’s
because the more recent his own
student days,.the less attention a
speaker expects. The less you ex-
pect from anything, the more you
are likely to get. I know. I ex-
pected good grades on my reviews
—and look what I got!

—o—

Here’s one I promised I’d put in,
so here it is: The English pro-
fessor said, “and now we will pro-
ceed to a study of syntax.” “My
gosh,” piped the freshman in the
back row, “have they started tax-
ing that. too?” And with your
laughter ringing in my ears, I will
bid you a cheery holiday. And
don’t worry; they haven't really
started taxing it.
