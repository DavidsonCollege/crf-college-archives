FOOTBALL OUTLOOK BRIGHTENS

Hopes of Wildcat football fans rose considerably last Saturday
night in Greensboro as Davidson .passed State dizzy in the third
quarter, and lost only a heart-breaking touchdown pass in the late
fourth period. With junior Granville Sharpe settling down to busi-
ness afterea shaky start, the ‘Cats brought the stands to their col-
lective feet as Sharpe fired passes to Hackney and Cowan for two
touchdowns, to which Stan’ Yoder added the points. Sharpe's aerial
bombs almost won the game at the end as Davidson made a sustained
