Despite Howell's new records, a
fourth quarter fallout means defeat

By Will Cobb

For once the football team's defense did
not hold up Saturday. Centre College broke
open a 24-24 tie in the fourth quarter with 20
points to put the game out of reach. The
combination of Kris Garrett and Joey
Johnson grinded out 290 yards on the ground
to hold off Davidson’s big play offense led
by record holding Richard Howell.

The loss took away Davidson’s chance
to win seven games for the first time since

1969. Now, the Cats (5-4) will have to face .

Bridgewater this weekend at home to ensure
awinning record for Head Coach Tim Landis.
The score remained tight for most of the
first half. The teams went into the locker
room tied at fourteen. The Cats struck first
with a seven yard trot by Bruce Bannister,
who finished the day with 46 yards on 12
carries. After falling behind 14-7, Davidson
tied the game later when Kelly Shirley
grabbed a 17 yard pass from Howell.

With Centre up 24-14 in the third quar-
ter, the big play potential of Howell took off
as he scampered 66 yards for a touchdown.
The Cats tied the game early in the fourth
quarter with a 36 yard kick by Drew Fassett.

After the field goal, the Colonels from
Danville, KY, poured it on, putting the
game out of reach with three rushing touch-
downs. Davidson was only able to score

Davidson’s second season was cut short
in the first round of their conference tourna-
ment for the second time in three years. The

when Howell
connected
with Ward
Davis for a 61
yard touch-
down pass.

Despite the disappointing loss, the story
of the day for Davidson was once again
senior quarterback Richard Howell. Howell
became Davidson’s career total offense
leader with 289 yards on the afternoon.
Though he was held in check through the air
(8-24-150 yards and 2 touchdowns), Howell
ran wild on the ground, racking up 139 yards
on 23 carries with one touchdown.

The 289 yards gives him 5,246 career
yards, surpassing Gordon Slade’s 4,983
yards compiled in the late sixties. He will
play his last game as a Wildcat this Saturday
at 1:30 against Bridgewater on Richardson
Field where Davidson will go for their sixth
win of the season.

Cats lost3-2in
an overtime
thriller. to
Marshall Uni-
versity.
The
loss ended a season full of frustration, leav-
ing the 1993 record at 7-12-2. Friday’s game
provided a rematch of the first round of last
year’s Southern Conference Tournament.
Unfortunately, the outcome would not be
the same as. Davidson’s 9-1 rout a year ago.

The Cats wasted no time in taking the
lead. Two minutes into the first half, Fresh-
man Robert Clarke took a beautiful pass on
the left side of the goal before blasting the
ball past a helpless Marshall keeper to take
a quick 1-0 lead.

Practice during the week off went ex-
tremely well, and it appeared the Cats were
on the prowl, but Marshall thought other-
wise. The answer came less than five min-
utes later when the Thundering Herd tied the

game up at one apiece. This score would
stand for the remainder of the half.

The game stood at 1-1 for almost 70
minutes until Senior Andy Haile punched in
the go-ahead goal, Ben Hayes assisted on ©
the play which helped give Davidson a 2-1
lead witha little overten minutes left to play.

Again though, Marshall answered
quickly, tying the game up with six minutes
to play. Both teams took the 2-2 tie into
overtime, where the intensity picked up both
mentally and physically.

Though no scoring occurred, Davidson
barely escaped as Marshall had two shots
that deflected off the crossbar. With about
ten minutes left in the second overtime,
things got even crazier.

A Marshall striker showed off his man-
liness by delivering a ferocious open handed
slap to defender Nick Troiano’s face. This
young man received a yellow card. This,
however, was just the beginning.

Moments later a Marshall player threw
the soccer ball into Haile’s stomach unpro-
voked. Haile reacted by knocking the wind

Charleston outswims the Cats

By Jen McGillan

On Saturday afternoon, in a
six lane meter pool at the College
of Charleston, the fun began, with
the 200 meter medley relay. (For
non-swimmers, that means eight
laps: two backstroke, two breast
stroke, two butterfly, and two
freestyle, done at high speed.) The
meter pool was a change for
Davidson swimmers, but it didn’t
bother them for long.

The competition was intense.
Among many stellar performances
were those of sophomores
Churchill Hoof and Corey Bean,
and freshman Tim Lim. Hoof won
the 800 meter freestyle, Bean came
», from behind:to.win the 200 meter

opposition to win the 200 meter
freestyle.

The Wildcats were not victo-
rious; the women lost by thirty
points and the men by six. How-
ever, despite the narrow loss, the
team feeling about the meet was
positive. Everyone swam well, and
many personal best times were
achieved.

The meet was also the advent
of a familiar yet different style of
coaching for the Wildcats. For the
next week and a half, they are
going to be under the direction of
Assistant Coach Chip Lavender,
while Head Coach Rich DeSelm is
on his honeymoon. The next meet

Pro hockey comes back to Charlotte

By Robert Lloyd-Still

With the Carolina Panthers
and Charlotte Hornets receiving
all the media hype and coverage
these days, little notice has been
given to the return of professional
hockey to Charlotte. After leaving
in 1977, the Charlotte Checkers
came back this season to Indepen-
dence Arena.

The Checkers play in the East
Coast Hockey League and theteam
is affiliated with the Boston Bruins
of the NHL (National Hockey
League). Other teams in the East
Coast Hockey League include the
Greensboro Monarchs, Roanoke
Express, Huntsville Blast, and
Nashville Knights.

Many hockey fans at Davidson
are ecstatic to see the return.

This past weekend, over fifty
Davidson students watched the
Checkers lose 5-2 tothe Richmond
Renegades.

Senior Bob Pascal, who con-
sidered buying season tickets be-
fore the season started, commented,
“Tt’s great to see hockey again.
There is nothing quite like the sights
and sounds of a hockey game. The
level of competition was a little
disappointing, but I plan on going
to a lot more games this season.”

The reason Pascal found the
competition disappointing is that
the Checkers are a minor league
franchise. Charlotte is two levels
below the NHL. When a player
succeeds at Charlotte, they move
up to Providence in the American
Hockey League. One mustrealize,
however, that many of the game’s
great players bypass Charlotte’s
level.

Charlotte first hosted profes-
sional hockey back in 1956. The
Charlotte Clippers were the first
hockey team to play in the South
and the organization was moder-
ately successful. When the South-
ern League folded in 1977, profes-
sional hockey left Charlotte for the

“next fifteen years."

Despite a 4-6 record,
Charlotteans have attended Inde-
pendence Arena in record num-
bers. When the Checkers played
Richmond Saturday night, the sta-
dium was filled to capacity. The
audience was cluttered with all
types of different fans. There were
anumber of families, students, and
those ever so noticeable, trans-
planted yankees who love to watch
their hockey.

The ambience of a Checker’s
game is fun and amusing. Most
fans have little experience at

hockey games and struggle with

such rules as icing, offsides, slash-
ing, and hooking. However, like
all other hockey fans, Charlotte
fans know how to hoop and holler
when they see the outbreak of a
good, violent fight.

The wide variety of music
played at Checker games is also
quite entertaining. One will hear
everything from Loverboy to
"Whoop, There it is!" When at-
tending a Charlotte hockey game,
it is most important to sit in the
front row. In the front one can hear
and feel the intensity of the game.
And it is a great view for all th
massive checks...) us gine srr
~*""-Thé Head Coach and Director

of Operations of the Checkers is
John Marks. Before coming to
Charlotte, Marks coached in the |
International Hockey League. Be-
fore coaching, Marks played for

‘the Chicago Blackhawks of the

NHL from 1970 to 1982. Heset the
organization’s record for consecu-
tive games played with 509. Marks
attended the University of North
Dakota and was twice an NCAA
all-American.

Two of the minority owners
of the Checkers are very familiar
to Carolina sports fans. Richard
“The King” Petty andhisson, Kyle,
both own stakes in the franchise.
Richard Petty made his name in
NASCAR with over $7.5 million
in career earnings and numerous
victories. ;

While not shown on televi-
sion, the Checkers can be heard on
radio. Sport610 AM broadcasts all
the Checker’s games and Sam
Smith handles the play-by-play.

The Checkers will be compet-
ing throughout March. They play
at Independence Arena and ticket
prices range from five to fifteen
dollars. Itisa very reasonable price
for a fun and exciting time. Don’t
