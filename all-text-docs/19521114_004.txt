Swain Has Headed Construction
Here At Davidson For 14 Years

By MOODY SMITH

The key figure in the construc-
tion of the half dozen buildings
that have been added to the David-
son campus in the last {4 years
has been Mr. W. E. Swain, former-
ty of Chaslotte, but now of David-
son,

Mr. Swain has been the construc-
tion superintendent for the F. N.
Thompson Construction Company
if Charlotte, which built all of
these buildings. Mr. Thompson.
president of the company, is, in-
cidentally, a graduate of Davidson
College.

The first construction job that
Mr. Swain supervised was that of
Duke dormitory, built in a matter
of some four months in 1939 when
building materials were cheaper and
more plentiful.

Mr. Swain stated that the reason
that the erection of the church and
the student union seemed to take
so long is the fact that nowadays
a good part of the time spent
on any job {js taken up in waiting
for delivery of scarce materials.

After the completion of Duke,
Mr. Swain started overseeing con-
struction of the library and science
building, which were started in
1940 and completed a little over
a year later.

World War II which began in
1941 halted most construction at
Davidson as it did nearly every-
where else. In 1943 some sidewalks
were faid, and the kitchen annex
was added to Chambers.

When the recent program was
begun in 1948, Mr. Swain was back
on hand to run things. The John-
ston Gymnasium was begun in that
year, and completed in ‘49, and in
the early spring of 50 work began
on the new church. This job was
by far the longest that Mr. Swain
has supervised, lasting about 26
months from the time that work-
men began tearing down the old
church until the new one was dedi-
cated.

said that he had decided that since
his work entailed his commuting
from Charlotte to Davidson , every
day that, he would just move out
here and simplify matters.
has beén-a resident of the David-
son community now for over two

years.

The latest job that Mr.
has been working ‘on is, of course,
the College Union.’ The building,
according to him. will not be com- |.
pleted. until May of ‘53. due to thie
fact that materials. have been slow
in arriving ever since the job began.
Swain said
everything he needed on hand now,
the building could be finished in 60

“The critter stood still as a.scare-

tice. ‘No, no Mike,’ says I, ‘my
hand would be sure ‘to shake if

dred miles of a shemale, and !

This story is, of course, just one
of many basically asinine tales that
the above mentioned tourists, in
one form or another, have made
up and spread about the mountain
country. It still remains for some-
one to collect the mountain stories
that are true, and stop the palming
off of these monstrosities on the
public.

Two freshmen escaped punish-
men at the hands of the Court of
Control this week by being ac-
quited of charges pressed against
them. "Seven others were not so
fortunate. They received the guilty
verdict and were duly punished for
their offenses.

Nelson Grice and Doug Andrews
were found without hats and were
requested to wear ribbons and were
made stud boys for upperclassmen.
Van Julian was also found without
his hat; his punishment was that
of being made study boy for an up-
perclassman and having to work

J. E. Lewis and Walter Coleman
were hardest hit with penalties this
week. Walter, guilty of quite a
few offenses, including walking on
the grass, gross obnoxiousness, ex-
treme conceit, and using language
which Mr. Arnold never heard on
the Davidson campus, was given
the duties of cleaning football —
shoes, writing an essay entitled,
“My Idea of a Good Davidson
Man," and running stud for an
upperclassman. J. E. Lewis re-
ceived his sentence for gross ob-
noxiousness, never speaking, and
bad manners. His penalty is hav-

that the hopé for society's sur-
Vival lies. It is dynamic of the,
pacifistic concept that can moti-
vate yentine international peace
and insure the individual rights of
men and women the world over.
The pacifist insists that society
can never attain unto its Divinely-
appointed destiny. until it is will-
ing to accept Christ's teachings
as criteria for its activities.

The ‘teachings arc commendable,
and certainly if everyone were a
pacifist there would be no war.
We are. concerned, however, with
practical techniques. How does the
pacifist. propose. to make his ideas
impinge upon society at large? If
he cannot suggest any tangible pro-
gram, his dreams must remain
dreams, and his ideas must be rele.
_ | gated to the pages of some modern
version of the Utopia,

The Christian Pacifist, however,
does have a program in mind. He
proposes to initiate it in that an-
cient institution, the Christian
Church. He enjoins Christians the
world over to awaken to the gulf
that lies between preachment and
practice and to actually apply the
Christian ideal to-their lives. When
the Church once begins to live
up to its teachings, its influence on
society will be unbounded. How
can we hope to impress the ulti-
mate validity of Christianity on
others when we do not accept it
experimentally ourselves?

The Christian Pacifist points be-
yond the pale of history for the
perspective his ideal requires. God
can work effectively through His
Church for proper human relations
once it denounces war and_ re-
pudiates personal involvement in
armed strife as inconsistent with
the teachings of its Foinder.

change for this cost? We have re-
ceived the continuance of the
American way of life, the right to
earn our living as we choose, and
to select our national leaders by
voting as we choose.
We have received the privils
ege of living in a manner de-
cided by the will of the ma-
jority and not by the orders of
a few power.crazy fanatics.”
Col. Davis then asked if the
value received was worth the price
paid; “You need only to look at
life in Communist China or in So-
viet Russia to make the compari-
son. Then decide for yourself if
war with its casualties is too high
a price for American citizenship.”

The. speaker concluded by salut-
ing those who. brought freedom
with their lives. He prayed that
world peace would put an end to
the necessity of defending our way
of life by war and its three at-
tendant horsemen—death, famine,
and pestilence.

Germans. On the last day of
combat a task force com-
manded by General Canham
captured over 244,000 prisoners.
