LEAVING... For the past two games, many
students have left the stands before the con-
test had terminated. This is one of the pod-
tent points in the Davidson spirit and it would
be advantageous for students to remain until
the final whistle has blown.

Affront ....

Like all well-equipped colleges we have an
“Infirmary.” The building is in worse con-
dition than the students it ever houses,
only holds together by sheer will-power or

and

orneriness.

Without heat, in appear-
ance, poorly arranged and inadequately equip-
ped, it is a nightmare both to the sick and to
those who have to wait upon them.

Even in a mild epidemic, as of the usual
spring cases of flu, there are just enough beds
and sufficient room to accommodate all the
sick adequately. The location of the rooms
is poor and makes for inefficiency. The light-
ing system could be improved.

This wooden structure was used as a dwell-
ing when presented to the college thirty years
ago. As an infirmary it is particularly inade-
quate. Its location as a college building is
extremely poor.

A Protest....

Several weeks-ago there appeared in this
column a defense of our athletic officials for
the way they handled the difficulties involved
in the demand for girls tickets prior to the
Carolina game. At that time we had no idea

and their personal needs before the Carolina

This phase of Davidson administra-
tion has always rubbed me the wrong way.
I have constantly wondered why the system
could not provide means which would encour-
rather than forbid attendance
to out of town games. Why not excuse the
absence of those who attend games off the
campus and give double cuts to students who
went to other places for the week-end. Not
all students realize the utter
that possesses every player when playing in a
strange town when he finds few, if any, fam-
iliar faces on the side lines; he feels licked be-
fore the whistle blows. Several years before
this school permitted six cuts per semester
per student—if this method was recalled it
would do a great deal to alleviate this sting
f “double-cuts.”
My contention is that this school should do
more to encourage athletics and an excellent
way to start is to encourage student attend-
ance to our out of town games.

It is a most wholesome and at-

of the Student Body, that they’ typ-
ify the Student Body and that they
are personally known to the stu-
dents. It is equally sound that the
football team is not an adjunct of
the College (nor the College an ex-
tension of the football team), but
that it is a part of the College. It
seems to me that it is in line with
the Davidson way of doing things
that the Student Body and their
girls be first consideration
in the stands at football games.

crowds are small, and might even
be considered a good business prop-

demand small. Since in proposi-
tion (a) crowds are large and re-

good shape, it is possible that the
budget could afford selling girls
tickets,

I believe that in a big game the
greater receipts will enable the ad-
ministration to stand the loss for the
girls tickets; and that the gain in
principle will be worth the finan-
cial loss.

The Davidsonian (“All the news

lamented arrival on the campus late,
so Kernel has a suggestion to make
