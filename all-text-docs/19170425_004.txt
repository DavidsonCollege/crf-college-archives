MR. JENKINS SPEAKS
AT Y. M. C. A. MEETING
At the regular meeting of the Y. M.
C. A. last Thursday night, Mr. Jenkins,
of the local Methodst Church, presented
various phases of the Christian Ministry.
The speaker began by saying that all
church members are affected by the min-
ister’s call. Some are actually called to
preach but the vast majority as church
members and officers have to act on calls
to others. In developing his subject Mr.
Jenkins dealt first with the nature of
the call. There are a few abrupt calls,
but as a rule the call is a matter of
growth. The preparation for the min-
istry was then duly emphasized. No
man can do justice to himself or to oth-
ers without adequate education. Finally
the speaker dwelt on the joys and sor-
rows of the ministry. ‘The chief joy of
the minister is his seeing Divine work
grow in his own hands. ‘The sorrows
come when this work seems to fail, Mr.
Jenkins ended by saying that these few
sorrows are lost in the joys of the work.

DAVIDSON MEN TO
JOIN OFFICERS’ CAMP
Quite a number of the Davidson stu-
dents will enlist for the summer train-
ing for officers. Dr. Martin has had
many inquiries concerning the training
camp and has recently received some ap-
plication blanks for same. Quite a num-
ber have been filled out by the students.
. The following of the Alumni have en-
listed: Messrs. J. Roy Barron, ‘11,
Rock Hill, §. C.; W. J. Roddey, '12,
Rock Hill, §. C.; W. P. Thomson, '16,
Rock Hill, §. C., and Dr. J. 1. Yoha-
man, Hopeville, Va., the Navy Medical

Department.

BRICK LAYING ON GYM
WILL BEGIN TODAY

The new Gymnasium is beginning to
turn out to be a reality at last—that is,
the work has begun on the foundation,
whether anything else is done to it or
not. The ground is being excavated for
the foundations, which are to be of brick.
Water has been piped down to the
grounds, a shed has been built which con-
tains many barrels of quick lime, large
piles of sand and bricks are distributed
around at strategic points, and every-
thing together gives one the impression
that the gym has at last started to come
into existence. If the same progress is
made in the future that has been made
during the past few days, the gym will
be finished by next fall, as it has been
promised. The laying of brick will

‘start today.

CONCRETE FOUNDATION
OF FLAG POLE FINISHED

Work is going on rapidly on the flag
pole. The concrete base foundation has
already been finished and the poles
are ready to be fastened together. Dr.
Martin saw fit to have thirty feet taken
off of one section, so that the entire
length of the pole will be only one hun-
dred feet when raised. The two sections
will be riveted together with iron bands.
The final step before raising it will be
to give it at last two coatings of white
paint. Mr. Hill hopes to be able to raise
it by the end of this week or the early
part of next week.

RAPID WORK BEING DONE
IN ERECTION OF TANK

The four supports of the tank have
been erected and work is going forward
in the assembling of the tank proper.
The material is on hand and every indi-
cation points to a rapid completion of
the work. To judge from the crowd of
onlookers or rather uplookers, one would
think that a Zeppelin had just been
sighted.

LENOIR WINS LAST GAME
BY VERY CLOSE SCORE

In a game featured by the good
mound work of both teams, Davidson
lost to Lenoir at Hickory last Tuesday
afternoon by the score of 1 too. The
lone run of the game came in the last
of the fifth, when Hengeveld walked
two Lenoir batters and hit a third, Beck
scoring on an error. “Home-run” Mc-
Millan, for Davidson, leaned on one
of Plyler’s offerings and sent the ball
soaring over a fence back of center field,
but fast fielding nailed him at the plate.
Davidson lost her chance of tieing the
game at this time. “Dutch” Hengeveld,
backed by almost perfect support,
allowed only two bingles. However,
Plyler, for Lenoir, was the star of the
game, allowing only three extra men to
face him in the nine frames.

STUDENTS BEING TAUGHT
MILITARY TACTICS

The men who come out for drill have
been divided up into two companies.
‘Those who have been drilling from the
beginning and have learned something
of the squad movements were put into
one company and are being put thru the
various forms of company drill. ‘The
others were placed together in a separate
company and are being trained in the
exectuion of the different movements of
the soldier and of the squad. “The men
are being drilled by the student officers
under the supervision of Liteutenant
Morrison. ‘Uhe finer points of the drill
will not be stressed to expert efficiency
on account of the lack of time, but a gen-
eral training in the life of a soldier and
his duties is to be given.

Efforts have been made to secure guns
for the companies, and altho no definite
word has been received, it is very prob-
able that they will soon be sent here.

DAVIDSON STATION
HAS BEEN PAINTED

The Southern Railroad has been mak-
ing additional improvements at the sta-
tion. The station building has been
painted inside and out. The regulation
colors were used on the outside, yellow
trimmed with black, with the under side
of the eaves painted blue. Inside, all of
the antiquated signs have been removed,
and a fresh coat of gray paint put on all
the walls with a coat of varnish on the
woodwork of the seats. There is a bul-
letin board put up that will hold all of
the signs in the future, which is much
better than putting them around just
anywhere a tack would stick in. The
public is very grateful for these long-
needed improvements,
