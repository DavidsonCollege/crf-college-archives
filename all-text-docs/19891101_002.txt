“You Won't Die,” but Manley’s tales of living with
an aboriginal tribe may make you laugh real hard

By JENNIFER SIECK

Imagine this: You are in a foreign
country to observea kind of people who
remain isolated and relatively un-
touched by 20th century global society.
You do not speak their language and
they speak little, if any, of yours. You
remember movies like Tarzan and
Hogan's Heroes and stories of other
“noble savages” and cannibals and
imagine that perhaps you will have a

similar encounter with these people.
You feel confident and maybe evena bit
superior in your potential abilities to
interact with these native people.
These are some of the feelings
Roger Manley experienced while pho-
tographing aborigines in Australia.
Manley told of his adventures in a talk
entitled “You Won’t Die: Life as a
Member of an Aboriginal Tribe.”
Manley received a Watson Fellowship

upon graduating from Davidson in
1975. He proposed to study the effects
of industrial development in Australia
simply because Australia was far away
from Davidson.

Manley’s adventures began when
two aborigines stowed away in his land
rover while he was visiting their reser-
vation. He planned to take them ten
miles out of the guarded area so they
could return to their communities.
However, the two rather wild-looking
Aborigines used facial expressions and
body language to indicate that they
wanted to continue driving. Manley
drove through the night under the navi-
gation of his two passengers. They trav-
eled into the desert until the land rover
broke down. While Roger Manley fran-
tically tried to fix the vehicle, his passen-
gers left to find a source of water.

Manley discovered that two people
were needed ‘to repair the land ‘rover.
He tried talking:to the aborigines’ in
Tarzan-type language, such as “This is
wrench,” “This is bolt,” “Put wrenchon
bolt.” Yet his companions failed to
understand. It took several days to fix
the transmission on the land rover.
Even after that, it only ran in first gear.

Manley expected the villagers to

receive him with reverence. Yet the
aborigines remained unimpressed by
his modern conventions. Their name
for him was the same of an elderly man
in the tribe. Manely thought they called
him “wise one” or “chief.” Much to
Manley’s chagrin, he found out that it
meant “senile.”

He got no special treatment from
the aborigines. In fact, he described his
place in their community as that of a
stray dog-—they fed him because he
hung around and couldn’t hunt for
himself. He was never involved in
heavy conversations. Although he was
able to pick up some vocabulary, he had
considerable difficulty. There were
eight male and eight female clans, each
of which had its own unique vocabu-
lary.

Manley lived with this tribe for
eight months before a plane flying over-
head’ ‘Spotted: his‘ disabled: latid' rover.

‘Manley said the villagers felt bad when

he left because he provided their source’
of entertainment.

When he finally contacted his par-
ents in the United States, Manley was
not made a hero. When he called them
by radiophone, his mother responded,

“Oh, hi. Everything going okay?”

Both Smith and O’Rourke
expressed concern with stu-
dents sitting in apparently
empty seats which turn out to
belong to a contributor. “We
don’t want to anger the guy
that gives a million dollars to
the arena,” said Smith. “What
happens if he gets mad and
pulls his money?”

Surprisingly, O’Rourke
and Smith stated that they and
coach Bob McKillop had to
fight some members of the
administration to get students
on the bottom level at all.

“Names and tales don’t
mix,’ said Smith. “But we re-
ally had to work to get some
people to even give you this
many seats.”

The policy was conceived

illop. Several ideas were pre-
sented to a committee of ten

“prominent” students for their
reaction.

“They gave us some ideas
and made some requests that
we followed, like the first
come, first serve policy,” said
O’Rourke. “This is.a good,
long-term policy.”

O’Rourke wants students
torealize that this policy can be
changed if it doesn’t work out,
“put I hope we can give it a
chance. We're looking down
the road to when every game is
sold out and Davidson is win-
ning its conference champion-
ship. Not many successful
teams reserve seats for the en-

“tire student body.”

O’Rourke said the success

of the Wildcats will make the.

policy necessary. “We will sell
this place out.”
