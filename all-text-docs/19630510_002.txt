To The Trustees

Two articles on the front page of
this newspaper deal with the latest
developments in the matter of Dr. W.
F. Goodykoontz’s resignation. These
articles point to serious discrepancies
of opinion among members of the
trustee committee on education them-
selves as to just what they did or did
not discuss at the committee’s meeting
last April 22. We do not understand
why these discrepancies exist. and we
hope an explanation will be forthcom:
ing from the trustee meeting next
week.

‘We would like to say something
2bout.a man who has always been fair
and considerate in dealing with this
newspaper and the student body. Al-
though this newspaper s editorial staff
may disagree with Dr. J. McDowell
Richards on several issues. at the same
time we have a great deal of admira-
tion for him. Dr Richards is a straight-
forward. almost bluntly honest man

Greek Laurels

The outgoing  Interfraternity
Council deserves congratulations
‘for the splendid job it did during
the past year. Under the lead-
ership of Johnny Rogers, it made sig-
nificant improvements in almost all
areas of its program.

The council demonstrated fore-
sight in contracting Oscar Brown last
fall. Verv few people had ever heard
of Oscar Brown when his signing was
announced. But almost everyone who
attended his concert was glad he had.
Through. hard work. the council ob-
tained the services of a fine enter-
tainer who might have been over:
looked bv a less efficient council seek-
ing only a “big name.”

The IFC showed originality in ar-
ranging a street dance on the fraterni-
ty court three weekends ago. Although
the dance got off to a slow start, by
late evening the combos were playing
to large audiences. The idea has been
well received by the student body,
and merits consideration for Spring
Frolics next year.

The council displayed common

who does not hesitate to take a forth-
right stand on an issue, and he is the
type of man who will explain his stand
in public, before students. For in-
stance. three vears ago Dr. Richards
took on about half the student body in
a spirited discussion of college poliey
in a Union forum.

He has expressed a willingness to
ask the Board of Trustees to hear Dr.
Goodvkoontz next Thursday, and we.
hope the trustees will see fit to keep
open a channel of communication pro-
vided for in their own charter—the
right of a professor to come before
them. If Dr. Goodykoontz’s request
for an audience is granted. we have no
doubt but that it will be a fair hearing.

We look forward to the arrival
on campus of Dr- Richards and. the

‘trustees. and if they so desire. we will

be glad to back up anything we have
printed on the matter.

sense and sound judgment in revising
its budget. Instead of a haphazard
method. of trying to hire entertain-
ment on an uncertain and often fluc-
tuating allotment, it provided that a
specific’ amount be set aside for each
concert. This enables the IFC to make
definite contracts with singers as
much as a year ahead of time.

Finally. the IFC showed good
taste in tentatively abolishing skit
night from the Greek Week activities.
What was originally intended to be a
clean. competitive contest between
pledge classes had by this year de-'
generated into a steady drool of corny
gags and smutty dialogue. The coun-
ecil’s decision was a positive step to-
ward making Greek Week the really
meaningful experience it can be as
the climax to the period of pledge
training.

We hope that the newly elected
IFC will carry on the standards of
sound judgment. originality. and good
taste established by. its predecessor.
To Johnny Rogers and the retiring
IFC, we sav thanks for a job well ai

To Save Gods, Himself

BY GREG GOVAN
Davidsonian Feature Writer

One of the more interesting books to arrive at the Davidson Library is Cornelius

Hackl's

from this fascinating volunie.

* cy

All went well until the Mon-
tenegrin contingent decided to
quit its aimless meanderings
and elected to lay seige to the
ancient and highly fortified
town of Veritas. During the
course of the battle. a subaltern
noted that the traditional weap-
on of Montenegro. the sheep-
skin sword, was highly ineffec-
tive against the town’s defenses.

This weapon was the national
mainstay. and had been used
since time immemorial. It was
merely a piece of parchment em-
bellished with Latin aphorisms
which was used in the second
way: if the enemy did not at
once flee from its display. it
was rolled up and used as a
club. A devastating effect was.
made if several metal keys at-
tached to a chein were. also
thrown atthe assailant. The. use
of the sheepskin sword was ac
companied by -a. series of: tradi-
tional dance steps and elabor:
ate gesticulations.

Despite limited rural en-
counters which were success-
ful for Montenegro, the seige
of Veritas was going any-
thing but well when the
weapons controversy broke
out. Lt. G. was upset that no
progress was being made, de-
spite the fact that messengers
to the home front carried
vivid stories of victory and
success.

He therefore. decided. to try
to make some of the. press re- .
leases good, and instructed his
platoon to forget about the
sheepskin sword and its elabor-

ate ritual and devise their own
means for breaching the de-
fenses. This innovation was fol.
lowed by spectacular success in
many quarters.

However, General M. and
his aide-de-camp, Col. J. no-
ticed with alarm that the best
of the new weapons, 8 cata-
pult affair, was notoriously
inaccurate, and as often as it
struck the defenses of Veritas
with devastating effect it also
lobbed projectiles into the
Montenegrin Command Post.

The commanders then thought
it advisable to limit use of the
new weapon lest it destroy some
of the tin gods in the Temple
adjacent. to Headquarters. Lt. G.
bitterly opposed this regression
to the inefféctual séeige’ meth:

‘ods. as well as attempts to have

the catapults fire only wads. of
paper so that if they did not
harm the enemy they at least
did. not harm the tin gods. Even-
tually, the catapults were used
to shoot glowing accounts of
‘Montencgro's supposed victories
back to the homeland to further
recruiting.

Accounts vary from dismissal
to resignation. but Lt. G. left the
army after the seige of Veritas
turned into internecine combat
within. the Montenegrin forces.

controversy we have seen the

to cover the story of Dr. Goody-

Texas Hospitality Wows
Richardson Hitchhikers

BY GUIDO FRIEDEL
Richardson Scholar

The following story will show
you why I prefer hitchhiking to
any other kind of travel.

We (fellow traveler Alex
Wustmann and |) made it to
Houston in twenty-eight hours.
From there | went on alone
and everything was fine till |
touched the desert south of
Corpus Christi. The sun was
glaring and no cars stopped
for hours. 1 felt exhausted,
crushed, and had visions of
THE DAVIDSONIAN with the
headline: “Oryed-Out Corpse
of Richardson Scholar Found
Beside Texas Road.”

But suddenly a young Texan
came by and showed a hospitali-
ty and helpfulness which would
have been hard for me to be-
lieve before. Like most Texans,
his family owned a big ranch
and that was where he took me,
explaining to me that 1 had
chosen the wrong way to Mexico
City and that the right one was
through Laredo. In Falfurrias
we found out that this day there

were no more trains leaving for
Mexico City.

At once his wonderful family
mvited me to stay overnight and
I accepted after a certain period
of polite hesitation. To kill the
rest of the day we went skeet-
shooting and I fired the first
thirty shots into the blue Texas
sky while the skeets sailed away
untouched. To cut it short, I had
a great, marvelous time.

Next morning 1 got (besides
sandwiches and a medicine for
diarrhea, the fear of the tour-
ist in Mexico) a Setter of rec-
ommendation which ! had to
give to their friends in Mexico
City personally. After that
they flew me to Laredo in
sheir private airplane and bid
me farewell. And luck actuat-
ly accompanied me.

In Mexico I was again invited
by these friends to stay in their
home in one of the best sections
of the city, and later, together
with Wustmann they showed us
the important points of attrac-
tion in and outside the “Dis-
tricto Federal.” At parties they

gave, we met ‘many young peo-
ple and had a wonderful time
together with them. Reluctant-
Ivy we finally decided to leave.

As cactus plants are good
souvenirs to take from Mexico,
I plucked two of them. and tried
to smuggle them back into “The
Land of The Free.” But you are
not free if you are carrying
cactus plants! I had hidden them
carefully in the sleeve of my
jacket, carrying it nonchalantly
over my arm. The elderly uni-
formed lady at the custom of
course asked if we had plants. I
forgot about being a Davidson
Gentleman and denied. vehem-
ently. Soon she found my cactus
plants, looked disgusted, confis-
cated them and said she had to
fine me one dollar.

Two days later we were back
in Davidson after a vacation
which we never had expected to
be so adventuresome and rich
in the meeting of new friends.
IT really recommend to you:
hitchhike to Mexico City, but

Laredo. She is sneaky.

me that we might put “spying”
here on a paying basis for the
Party.

in spite of the fact thet 1
have been cleared many times
by psychistrists as pertectly
sane end mentally competent,
the illusion persists emong
some intellectual groups thet
because | espouse openiy
some of the doctrines of Adolf
Hitler | must be “nuts”. Uni-
versity departments of social
psychology, sociology, political
science, and philosophy have
displayed so much interest in
the Party and my person that
1 believe there must be many
students who would welcome
the chance to live with and ob-
serve our Stormtroops and
myself in action over a per-
iod of time.

AS an experiment. therefore,
I have decided to offer a very
limited number of sincere stud-
ents the opportunity to spend
the summer living and working
with us for the purpose. of pro-
fessional study, for a moderate
fee.

Students to be accepted will
have the opportunity of working
outdoors on our farms. partici-.
pating in or observing all Party
activities as they may desire, sit-
ting in on Party meetings, study-
ing all phases of our operations,
accompanying me on speaking
tours, etc. The Federal Bureau
of Investigation and all Police
Authorities will be clearly in-
formed that such students are
NOT members of the’ Party and
that they are NOT working for
the Party.

It would be inappropriate and
impractical to go into further
details in a letter such as this.
Interested students should write
me personally for descriptive
literature, answers to questions
and application blanks.

without seeming to achieve
any lasting solution (or even
an honest effort at one) to the
basic problem of the adminis-
tration’s wanting something
for nothing. While he may

have resorted to questionable
methods (and statements) in
his display, this mekes the
problem no less valid.

It is without doubt a tragedy
that Dr. Goodykoontz has been
relieved. He, however, will be
able to find some other place
for his talents. A more meaning-
ful fact is that with him will go
one of the few stimulating fac-
tors that have kept alive the
interest of the small number of
students who have not succumb-
ed to the general apathetic at-
mosphere that prevails on cam-
pus.

As a student I realize that the
members of the administration
have both knowledge and judg-
ment superior to mine and that
they are under no obligation to
explain their actions to any stud-
ent. Knowing that they are part
of a church supported college.
however, I will suggest that they
refer to Daniel 11:31-38. and see
if they notice a resemblance
that a surprising number of

people on campus think exist...

Who can fell. . they might want
to change it. Feet of gold that
would equal our alleged head
would in truth make us the best
college of our kind in the nation.

was “mentally ill” and “in need
of psychiatric care.” Dr. Goody-
koontz was never informed
about this call until his family
arrived on Saturday. The admin-
istration was obviously aware of
the effect this call would have
on his family and the pressures
which would be brought upon
him.

The point of this article is
not to condemn the adminis-
tration for their actions in
this controversy. The sad part
of our story at Davidson is
that their actions merely re-
flect the state of the church
which brought these pressures
to bear through the adminis-

tration.
During the controversy,
for instance. it was = ru-

mored that J. McDowell Rich-
ards phoned the president and
demanded that Dr. Goodykdontz
be removed from the school.
The validity of this rumor can-
not be confirmed. but it is in
keeping with Dr. Richards’ state:
ment that a faculty member at
Davidson “does not have the
freedom to teach what he wants.
However he does have the free-
dom to think as he wishes and
the freedom to leave.”

Students and faculty at- David-
gon are subject to such pres-
sures from the Southern Presby-
byterian Church whose leaders

flict with their own. This atti-
tude is shown in the restrictive

The. resonant, rapid-fire voice was Dr. Chalmers
Davidson’s, and we sat and talked about a lot of things.
His book, for instance. Next semester, on sabbatical

leave, he expects

to round out his research on a new hook.

“My working title is A Sociological _Investigation of
Agrarian Leadership in South Carolina in the 1860's. It’s
about the big-rich, the planters—over a hundred slaves-—
in South Carolina before Reconstruction.”

The woman in Columbia to whom it will be submitted
for publication was not wholly satisfied. with the title.
She liked the subject though—wants to call it The End of
Aristocracy. “In the first place.” says the author, “Even
if it was the end of aristocracy, South Carolina doesn’t
know it. We haven't really been reconstructed yet.” He
‘was laughing—he laughs often. ;

The talk covered a lot. of ground, informally. Life,
life at Davidson, life in the South. These things he knows;
and to say his pertinent: observations are colorful. per-
ceptive, or plain truth is to understate the case.

He. too, is concerned with creativity at Davidson.

“You know it’s possible that Davidson lost more men,
percentage-wise, in the Civil War than any other college
in the United States. All our men were stil] young enough,
the graduates I mean, to fight.”

He knew about Davidson during that war—who was
here and what went on—and about the World Wars. And
all about. Davidson up to the moment.

Given this situation, how can
we hope to improve our college

is cooperative leadership among
students, faculty, administration.

sures of the church together,
our college can never break the

upon us.

Dear Editor:

I feel that’ the impressions.
after nearly one year, of a more-
or-less impartial observer, might
be of value to all sections of
Davidson College.

Davidson's object in setting
out to produce “well-rounded.
whole men” is, I think, open to
query. Although it is highly
desirable to have a liberal arts
education, must this mean “well-
rounded men?” How many men,
who have stood out in history,
have been well-rounded and
whole? Very few, I think—it is
the individual, who still has
his outstanding, unrounded.
salient edges, that will leave his
mark upon the age in which he
lives.

This individuality can be
brought out in two major ways.
Firstly, the admission of more
students of different cultural.
social, economic, and geogra-
phic backgrounds, will inevitab-
ly cause discussions, arguments
and thoughts to arise. It is the

ideas of this generation that will | _

govern the United States twen-
ty years from now.

Secondly, an individual
sense of responsibility is es-
sential for balanced ideas; and
responsibility can only come
about where there is freedom
in which to exercise this re-
sponsibility. Davidson stud-
ents have not abused the new
cut-system, so why not give
them the chance te show their
responsibility in other tlelds?

Davidson College today is
governing the thoughts, ideas
and ideals of the United States
of tomorrow. Is this not a chal-
lenge worth accepting?
