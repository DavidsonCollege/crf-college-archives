First place in the Northern Divi-
sion was at stake last Monday night
when VMI rolled into Belk Arena to
7a spar with

2 iDavidson’s
| Wildcats. It cer-
tainly shoWed.

In a game characterized by bumps
and bruises, the stronger, more physical
Wildcats pounded their way to a 76-66
victory. _

The 2,249 fans saw three players
foul out and VMI’s Aaron Demory

THE DAVIDSONIAN

ejected for a flagrant foul late in the
second half, after the Keydet tossed
Wildcat Davor Halbauer across the
floor with an swift forearm.

“Davidson is the most physical
team in the league,” VMI coach Bob
Bellairs said as he answered questions
regarding Demory’s ejection.

The game’s wild and physical style
fit Landry Kesmalski’s style to a tee.
“L Train,” as the junior forward has
been dubbed by Wildcat broadcaster
Frank Santore, led the way for the
Wildcats as he recorded his fifth double-
double of the year with 22 points and 11
rebounds.

Davidson students
were in for a treat as
Kosmalski entertained
the crowd with some soar-
ing dunks. But the Wild-
cat coaching staff was in
for a treat of their own,
specifically with the free-
throw shooting of the 6’7”
forward. Kosmalskihitall
nine of his free throw at-
tempts on the night, after
entering the game with a
frustrating 45% rate from
the charity stripe.

“For him to go 9-9 is
a tremendous statement
to his hard work before
and after practice,” coach
Bob McKillop said.

VMI’s nickname,
the Running ‘Roos, defi-
nitely characterized
VMI’s game plan—their
full-court pressure cre-
ated an almost-frantic
pace forthe game. VMI’s
defensive intensity forced
22 Wildcat turnovers, but
the ‘Cats forced 19 of their
own as VMI showed
sloppy ball control
throughout the game.

“We tried too hard
to create on our own,”
coach Bellairs admitted.

Early on, Davidson
responded well to VMI’s
pell-mell style, convert-
ing many easy lay-ins out
of their transition offense
while only committing 6
first-half turnovers.

“It was a very re-
lentless and passionate
defensive effort by VMI,”
praised coach McKillop. “They force
you to go back on your heels or attack,
and Iam pleased with how we attacked.”

A shallow bench seemed to hurt
the Wildcats in the second half as fa-
tigue led to numerous faulty passes,
enabling VMI to stay in the game.

“The turnovers maybe are a re-
sponse to the minutes played in the
second half,” McKillop said.

But the Keydets could not
handle Davidson’s inside presence

@ Chadd Holmes made the most of Ben Ebong’s
absence, coming off the bench to contribute 18
points to the Wildcat effort on Saturday.

despite the fact that the Wildcats lacked
the services of sixth man Ben Ebong,
who remains sidelined due to a back
injury.

Senior Chadd Holmes stepped in
and filled Ebong’s absence, tying his
career high with 18 points in only 21
minutes of play.

“The four and five positions are
giving us pretty darn good production,”
commended McKillop. The Wildcats
also pulled down12 more rebounds than
VMI including a new career high

VMI’s Jason Bell, the South-
ern Conference’s leading scorer
(19.5 ppg), led the Keydets with 22
points. Although he bettered his sea-
son average, Bell was held under
his overall shooting percentage (50
percent) due to aggressive defense
from Emeka Erege and Halbauer.

“Jason Bell is a tremendous
player. Emeka and Davor did an
outstanding job,” said McKillop.

Men’s tennis back on the court

In the weeks leading up to the
opener of the men’s tennis season,
Coach Jeff Frank focused his team’s
efforts on singles competition, often
foregoing doubles practice time.

With this in mind he had high

UNC-Chapel Hill 6

hopes that Davidson would match-up
well individually with their first oppo-
nent of the season: UNC-Chapel Hill.

As such, the results of the meet
could not have been more unexpected.

North Carolina’s Tar Heels, ranked
forty-seventh nationally, swept all six
of the singles matches while the Wild-
cats prevailed in the doubles.

“Our doubles were very good, very
consistent,” Coach Frank said. “We
just knew what we were doing out there,
but our singles’ strategy left a lot to be
desired.” ‘

In college tennis a maximum of
seven points can be earned in each dual
match. A school gains a point with each
of the six singles matches that it wins
and must clinch at least two of the three
doubles matches to earn another point.

Davidson, suffering loses at all six
singles positions but winning two of the
three doubles matches, lost to the Tar
Heels 6-1. :

On the positive side, the Wildcats’
doubles teams played very well, with
the #1 team of seniors Scott Briggs and
Judson Sutherland and the #3 team of
senior Paul Wulfsberg and junior Brett
Ialacci garnering decisive victories. The
#2 tandem of senior Tyler Epp and
junior Alex Okulski was the only
Davidson duo to lose to North Carolina.

Coach Frank was pleased with the
performance, especially considering
that three of his six doubles players
from last season graduated last May.

“The doubles played very well,
and it looks as if we'll keep some of
these teams together for the next couple
of matches,” he said.

The singles, however, were swept
in straightsets by the Tar Heels. Frank
cited a lack of concentration and an
abundance of unforced errors. as the
primary factors in Davidson’s losses.

As the 1999 season gets under-
way, Frank believes there is no reason
this squad cannot match or even im-
prove upon last year’s second place:

-finish in the Southern Conference tour-

nament. Although the team is weak-
ened by the graduation of last year’s #1
and #3 singles players, the tremendous
depth that characterizes the 1999 team

may be more than able to compensate
for these losses.

“We have nine players who could
play in the top six spots,” Frank said.

Such depth gives him the flexibil-
ity to mix and match doubles teams and
shake up the singles line-up for the best
possible combination. The ’Cats’ next
match is at home on Saturday against
twoteams, Queens College and Belmont
Abbey.

Playing multiple opponents on the
same day will allow the Wildcats. to
evaluate their current line-up and adjust
it accordingly before they move on to
the bigger guns in their schedule, namely
East Carolina (a home match on Febru-
ary 23) and South Carolina (on Febru-
ary 26).

A key. for the Wildcats. will be
keeping everyone healthy. Already they
have lost sophomore Billy Boykin to
injury along with freshman David
Webb, but Webb expects to join fellow
freshman Chad Winebarger in the
line-up within weeks.

Coach Frank's strategy for the sea-
son: “Fight like hell in the doubles to

‘get into the singles in good shape.”

If the Wildcats can accomplish
this and stay consistent in their singles
play, they may once again be rolling
through the Southern Conference come
tournament time in April.
