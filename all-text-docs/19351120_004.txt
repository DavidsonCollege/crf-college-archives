To--Wildcat supporters, the. above

these fighting ‘Cats will be rewarded

hkewise with such a membership. That
ay may roll around pretty soon as con-
terence officials will meet next month to
decide who the lucky schools will be; if
any. Davidson certainly deserves to be
included. We believe it will.

Fields Young gave the first in-
dication of the alertness which
characterized the entire team
when he recovered the first of the
eleven fumbles two minutes after
the opening kickoff. Fields, play-
ing at Left End, has been a lead-

two games, snagging a pass for
40 yards in the Duke game and
paving the way for our first touch-

fireworks in the form of “Teeny”

of 37, 27 and 18 yards. However,
atthe half “Teeny” was afflicted
with a bad case of what was
thought to be appendicitis and so
he was removed to a hospital,

how Jim takes care of his job, say that
he differs from Dick in that he varies

opposition while Dick, with 185

that Ed Armfield made ‘his third

TRANSFERS LOOK GOOD

Season Looks Promising Despite
Loss of Letterman

In the seasons of sports the memories
of the years excitements of football goes
down in sportive history while the hopes
of basketball arises to take the stand.
In Davidson the ‘Cat Basketeers have
started the early grind of practice in
preparation for the coming schedule.
The Cagers started their practices last
week, practicing three times a week at
night in the gymnasium. The practices
have only been attended by those men
who are not playing football and are go-
ing out for basketball. Of the sixteen
men that have been coming out, Coach
Laird has only been working them on
individual practice such as passing, shift-
ing,’ dribbling, and shooting. No detailed
practice has been done as yet but within
the next two weeks regular work will
begin.

The Wildcats will start their season
this year with the loss of Morgan, Ross,
Yelverton, Harris and Windham who
were the holdup for the Cagers last year.
Windham Peabody is the only letterman
of last year’s squad who is still at school
but will not be out for practice due to a
injury during. football. However
are several men--from the
squad of last year and also three trans-
fers who have shown up very well so far
in practice.

The early practices have not been of
any sort that would determine as to who
would be stars of this season but it
inight be noted that Armstrong, a trans-
fer from Belmont Abbey College, has
been doing very well so far in practice.
Also Yearwood, another transfer has
been doing well arid Coach Laird is work-
ing on him to take over the center posi-
tion, Hancock has also been doing very
well in practice so far.

The frogh team of last fall came out
with a very good season bringing many
good players up to the varsity squad this
year. The men~are “Barrow, Rhinehart,
Kline, Iversof, Reed, and of\these Bar-
row and Ree have been the) moSt out-
standing.

The Cagers from last year’s squad
who returning are Knorr, Quick,
Peabody, and Cathey. These men all did
good work last ‘season and are expected
to get the first string.call this year along
with Morris Freeman and Bailey Wil-
liams who were not out for the squad
last year but were outstanding ball play-

As the team this year takes its stand,
lespite the many losses from last year,
Manager Morrow says, ‘We have a very
hard schedule and have lost many good

Duke Victory Upsets
Dopesters’ Predictions

In spite of the various and sundry
Prognostications “bf sports enthusiasts
last week, not a one picked Carolina to
suffer a defeat at the hands of Duke and
as a result Felix almost decided to take
the tickets and enjoy the show himself
but (confidentially) the fear of being
mobbed decided things otherwise and so
tickets this week go to O. M. Covington
and G. J. Jordon.

Those interested in the contest and
wishing to win tickets to the show, must
pick the scores and print them in the
blanks beside each team. Take for ex-
ample Davidson 14, Wake Forest 0,
Only one blank can be handed in per
person and this must be in the hands of
the sports editor by 2 P. M. Friday. Al-
though the blank is printed below for

THIS SEASON

Wildcat Matmen Begin
Pre-Seasonal Practice

The Davidson College wrestling
team, state champions last year, have
begun action toward the leadership of
Coach ‘Doc’. Unger and Captain Le-
Roy Blackwelder.

Although no official registration has
been made, most of the candidates try-
ing out are as follows: LeRoy Black-
welder, Bob Blue, John Allen, M. B.
Crisp, D. A. Davis, F. Dade, Joe Gam-
ble, Jim Hodgin, C. A. Cooper, Elmore
Holt, J. B. Johnston, Joe Kellam, Doug-
las Neal, Frank Owens and C. W.
Parder.

The team will be weakened by the
loss of Captain Charles Fort, Lawrence
Quarterman, Luther Shiery and Knos
Thompson from last year’s team. Last
year the Wildcat Grapplers won the
state championship by virtue of wins
over State, Carolina and Duke. They
were defeated only by V. P. I.

Polk Moffet has not yet come out for
the team. His position will probably
be filled by Bob Blue. Blue has been
wrestling for a number of years and is
expected to fill the position capably.

SENIOR of
WINNING FORM

Thursday Sees Sophs and Juniors
Lose One Game Each;
Freshmen Trail

With an excellent chance of repeating
last year’s performance by winning inter-
class volleyball, the class of '36 emerged
with a clean slate from the games played
Thursday, November 14. The junior and
sophomore teams each lost one game,
while the freshmen brought up the rear
by losing both games.

The most interesting game of the after-
noon proved to be the one between the
sophs and seniors. Playing two out of
three games, each team won one game
out of the first two. The players were
very evenly matched, with ‘The Goon”
Vause and Bill Kiesewetter starring for
the lower class and F. Parker and M. J.
Barnett starring for the pre-centennials.
The third game commenced as if it were
going to be a fight to the finish, but when
the score reached five all, the seniors
displayed excellent teamwork to over-
whelm their opponents. The feature of
the game was “The Goon's” smashing,
which the seniors did not get under con-
trol until the third game. The scores of
the three games were’5-21, 21-16, 21-9.

The seniors easily defeated the fresh-
men in two games, with scores of 21-6,
and 21-4, The senior captain, Barnett,
sent jn a new team for the second game,
but, despite this, the red-caps had no
chance during the entire match. The
freshman team gaye the centennials a
little more competition, winning the first
of-the three games. In the second game,
however, the juniors found their stride
and experienced little difficulty in taking
the match. The scores of the games were
as follows: 16-21, 21-17, 21-17.

The members of the class of '37 proved
to be no match for the sophomore team,
bowing to them to the tune of 21-1, 21-2.

DRIZZLE SLOWS GAME

Jackson and Daniels Lead Caro-
lina’s Futile Attack

By YATES FAISON

A wonderful Duke team rose to su-
preme heights Saturday in its own sta-
dium before 46,880 enthusiastic fans, who
braved the biting cold and a drizzling
rain to see Wallace Wade's Blue Dev-
ils overwhelm Carolina’s “dream team”,
25-0.

The gigantic crowd, largest in southern
football history, jammed into every
available space to witness sixty minutes
of one of the most thrilling games ever
to be played in the Old North State.
While cheering a marvelously superior
Duke eleven to a well-earned victory,
the crowd seemed to echo Carolina's
realization of broken dreams. Numbed
by their disappointment, Carolina par-
tisans came forward to acknowledge
Duke's brilliancy and superiority.

Led by their great Ace Parker, Duke
took command of the game at the open-
ing kick-off, and it never relinquished
this commanding position until the final
whistle. Staying ever alert on the soggy,
slick gridiron, the Blue Devils turned
Carolina’s famed passing attack iit6° a
boomerang, and they converted these in-
terceptions into scoring opportunities.
Ace Parker overshadowed every other
player on the field, and his magnificent
kicking kept the Tar Heels deep in their
own territory throughout most of the
game. Ably seconding Parker, Alexander
and Ward contributed long touchdown
jaunts, Alexander intercepting a pass on
his own 5-yard line and racing 95 yards
for a score, while Ward swept around
end for 47 yards and another touchdown.
Alexander scored Duke's second touch-
down in the third quarter on a plunge
from the l-yard line, and Parker crashed
over guard and romped 30 yards for the
final score in the final minute of play.
Don Jacksofprovided Carolina’s long-
est run in the second quarter when he
raced from his goal-line on a fake punt
and dodged through a broken field for
52 yards before being pulled down from
behind. His passing was sadly handi-
capped by the wet pigskin, and he had
trouble all afternoon in tossing his passes
to the few receivers open. Montgomery,
with the ball on his own 3, early in the
first quarter, called bne of the smartest
plays of the game. Afraid of having
Duke block a kick behind the goal, he
called for Jackson to pass instead. From
a kick formation, Jackson heaved the
ball 55 yards to Hackney, Duke's safety
man, who was tackled on the 50.

Parker and Hackney played together
for the first time this season, and they
worked together nicely in the new plays
that Wallace Wade added to give de-
ception to his already powerful system.
Other Duke stars included Alexander,
Ward, West, Hennemier, and Captain
Jim Johnston. Jackson, Buck, Snyder,
Daniels, Trimpey, and Webb shone for
the Heels. In Carolina's scoring threat,
early in the game, Babe Daniels’ try for
a field goal from Duke’s 14 was short
by only a few feet.

WILDCATS TIE POINTERS
IN FIRST SOCCER CLASH

Frat’s Sport Program
Gains New Popularity

In the past few years the inter-
fraternity sports program at David-
son has b more extensive and
more popular than ever before. It
has been encouraged, and it has
developed so greatly that it is now
ranked along with the programs of
this kind of the foremost colleges.

Golf, horseshoes and track have
been added to the list of inter-fra-
ternity sports, which already in-
Iuded football, baseball, volley ball
and basketball. Because of this ad-
dition all of the fraternities have
elected managers to direct their pro-
grams. These men will try to get as
many as possible to participate and
will appoint separate captains for
each of the different events.

The managers elected by the fra-
ternities are: Beta Theta Pi, G. T.
Tipton; Pi Kappa Alpha, Bob An-
ders; Kappa Alpha, Joe Johnson;
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Yates Faison;
Kappa Sigma, Charlie Thompson;
Pi Kappa Phi, Tom Cameron; Phi
Gamma Delta, Bob Gregory; Phi
Delta Theta, John Partridge, and
Sigma Phi Epsilon, Martin Barnett.

average in their clash with the Wofford

Surprising Ability

CULLER SCORES TWICE

Armstrong, Bixler and Kester
Lead Davidson Attack

The Davidson scocer team fought High
Point, last year’s state champions, to a
3-3 deadlock here Friday. Both teams tal-
lied once in each of the first three quar-
ters, High Point scoring first each time.
Davidson won the toss and elected to
defend the north goal. The Panthers
kicked off and penetrated deep into Wild-
cat territory before a lusty boot from
the toe of Co-captain Scott stopped the
attack. The teams played on even terms
for several minutes untih Culler, High
Point’s crack center forward, made a
long run and kicked squarely between
the uprights for the first s@re of the
game. Just before the quarter ended
Donigian, Wildcat left wing, took a pass
from Bell antd scored.

Karly in the second quarter Culler
made a nice run and passed to Ellington
who scored. A few minutes later David-
son put on a nice exhibition of passing,
working the ball far down the field be-
fore Bell finally, scored with a kick that
bounced through after hitting both posts.
This quarter was featured by the beauti-
ful running of Culler..

Soon after the beginning of the second
half Davidson made a determined drive
and threatened for several minutes, but
Isler finally staved off the attack with a
booming kick. High Point again took the
lead when Culler, after dribbling close
to the Wildcat goal, kicked between the
posts. After another Panther attack had
been repulsed, Armstrong made a beauti-
ful run that was one of the highlights
of the game. However, his efforts were
in vain when Isler kicked out. Then Bix-
ler made another nice run and scored
with a perfect kick from a difficult angle.
During the last quarter High Point
was on the defensive nearly all of the
time, as Davidson attacked furiously, but
was unable to muster enough push to
score, and the game ended in a tie. Dur-
ing the Ist half the teams seemed to be

ended in disaster so far as the frosh
were concerned: the State freshmen came

the result that their loss was by only
13-0. But the Duke first year men man-
aged to run wild at the expense of the
Davidson frosh, who lost this time by
33-0,

And yet the season so far does not
seem tobe such a failure as the won-
and-lost record would indicate. The
trouble does not seem to be with the
individual players; rather the difficulty
lies in the fact that they have not had
enough experience playing together.

Gasteiger, Abell, and Iverson
showed up extremely well in the line
throughout the entire schedule, while
Brown, in the backfield, has been gain-
ing consistently.

There seems to be no reason to bé-
