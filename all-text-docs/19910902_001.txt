Patterson Court & Dean of
Students Change Freshman Policy

By Tom Koonce

In an effort to introduce fresh-
men to all that Davidson has to
offer without them being absorbed
by Patterson Court a regulation
was passed last week prohibiting
freshmen from attending upper-
classmen parties of any type.

The regulation was passed by
the presidents of Patterson Court
and Dean of Students Will Terry. It
reads, “Upperclassmen will not
entertain freshmen on campus or
offcampusand freshmen are not,to
attend upperclass parties#éntil
September 20. Failure to abide by
this agreement may forfeit a fresh-
man’s ability to participate in Pat-
terson Court.”

The regulation adds that if
members of a Patterson Court
house commit an infraction “the
house may forfeit its participation
in Patterson Court activities.”

The background of this regu-
lation dates back to seven years
ago when freshmen could still go
down onthe court during their first
few weeks at Davidson. Terry

‘explainedthat freshmen were down
on the court every: night during
those weeks.

Terry commented on the fact
that several problems developed
during these years. Chief among
these problems was the decline in
freshmen academic performance.
A committee was formed to ad-
dress this problem. After studying
the situation, the committee de-
cided that freshmen should not be
allowed on the court for the first
ten weeks of school.

The CCRL then deliberated
this issue and after experimenting
with time periods as long as six

weeks and as shortas three, it was
decided that four weeks was the
appropriate amount of time tokeep
freshmen from going down on Pat-
terson Court.

Terry stated that the academic
average of the freshmen class rose
.10 points after this new system
was put into place. He said that
this new policy obviously had a
very “tangible academic effect.”

Atfirst this policy worked well,
but as years have passed fraterni-
ties have attempted to subvert the
system by having dorm and off
campus parties. Terry added, “This
year they (parties) seemed to hita
new level.”

The CCRL met and decided
that this problem needed to be
brought up to the Patterson Court
presidents. Terry then met with
the presidents to draft this new
regulation.

According to Terry the pur-
pose of this regulation is to “get
the freshmen on a good academic
track and to expose themselves to
other things at Davidson besides
Patterson Court.”

‘On theissueof why this policy
was rushed into effect Terry said,
“We couldn’t wait any longer, we
had.to move fast.” He added that
it was unfortunate that this wasn’t
done in the spring.

Terry said that this regulation
was also influenced by a lot of
input from this year’s Hall Coun-
selors. He also acknowledged that
it puts an added responsibility on
the Hall Counselors. Terry also
believes that the Union has and
will continue to provide opportu-
nities for freshmen to get to know

upperclassmen on a neutral basis.

Terry addressed the issue of
whether or not this new regulation
is too vague, “Everybody wants a
strict interpretation of this rule. If
people will read it rationally they
will understand the intent of the
thing and can use their own com-
mon judgement to understand it.”

On the problem of freshmen
leaving campus to drink at bars and
other such places Terry said, “It
definitely bothers me, but I can’t
let it control decisions made by
Davidson.” He also added that if
someone is stupid enough to drink
and drive than that is their personal
decision. Terry explained, “We
can’t break the law to accommo-
date the freshmen and keep every-
one on campus.”

Elaborating on this, Terry said,
“Abuse of alcohol is a serious
problem at Davidson and we are
going to move with vigor to turn it
around. This doesn’t mean we
want a dry campus but we do want
a responsible one.”

Terry said that fraternities were
toblame for the problem thatled to

thisregulation, buthe believes they”

will abide by this new policy.”

Around campus response has
been both positive and negative.
Freshman John Murchison said that
this rule “restricts personal free-
dom of association,” while Fresh-
man Christopher Martin stated,
“It’s only a few weeks so I guess
it’s not that big adeal.”

Todd Newman, president of
Sigma Phi Epsilon said, “The rule
is a little absurd in some ways in
that it segregates the classes. He
also added that it is good in other

Medical Humanities Brings
Physician-in-Residence to
Campus for Three Years ~

By Tom Koonce

Davidson’s three-year-old in-
terdisciplinary Medical Humani-
ties program is bringing a physi-
cian-in-residence to team-teach a
seminar here for the next three
years. Dr. Stephanie Carperos will
teach health care courses each
semester for these next few years.

The Medical Humanities pro-
gram is also developing a system
of student internships at Planned
Parenthood, Hospice, the Metro-
lina AIDS Project, and four area
hospitals.

The Medical Humanities pro-
gram at Davidson examines the
area of modern health care from
various perspectives, including
legal, political, and technological
viewpoints.

Davidson’s program is also
unique among colleges in that it
offers students an interdisciplinary
procedure of the study of health
care. It includes 16 courses from
areas such as religion, history, and
political science.

Rosmarie Tong, a philosophy
professor, is the director of the
Medical Humanities program.
Grants have helped this program
at Davidson to move forward. The
Fullerton Foundation provided a
$130,000 grant to help fund the
new physician-in-residence semi-
nars. GTE provided $5,000 to
bring speakers to Davidson to talk
about care of the terminally ill.

On September 26 &27 the
program will hold the F.W. Speas
Colloquium in Medical Ethics.

Students Move to
Bring WALT to Life

By Russ Tisinger

Some Davidson students are
trying to breathe new life into
WALT, the student-run radio sta-
tionat Davidson. Thestation, which
operated from 1988 to 1990, has
been recently striving to broadcast
on an FM wavelength. An FM
station, say supporters, would mean
more listeners, more interest from
record companies, and more inter-
est fr6in: Davidson students them -
‘selves. — “i

An FM station would bring
with it a lot of advantages over the
system that was used from 1988 to
1990, according to Ben Towle, a
senior philosophy majorandacen-
tral figure behind the push. The
chief problem with the’ station
during its sporadic two year run
was the sound quality.

The carricr current system,
which broadcast WALT through
electrical wiring of the five uphill
dorms, Belk, “Watts, Sentelle,
Richardson, and Cannon, emitted
a quality of sound worse than the
worst AM station on the dial.
Broadcasts were barely audible
above a loud constant buzzing
noise. Students in Duke dorm. who
were supposed to hear WALT,
didn’t hear anything at all.

However, if WALT actually
gets a 500 watt FM station, not _

only would the signal be clear, but
all the students on campus could
tune in. Additionally, the wattage
would be powerful enough to reach
all of Davidson and possibly parts
of Huntersville.

The improvements would gen-
erate enough of a listener base to
encourage record companies to
send the station free music as they
normally do for other FM college
tadio stations, Towle ‘said: Also,
Towle believés thatthe FM station
would require less maintenance
than the problematic carrier cur-
rent system after all the necessary
equipment is in place.

WALT is not the first student-

‘ run station that has been organized

at Davidson. In years past, stu-
dents ran the WDAV radio station
from the Union building ata power
of 10 watts. The programming was
largely student-controlled. Even-
tually; the decision was made to
move towards a classical format.
Students were allowed to broad-

-cast an alternative show called

“Flipsides” in the evenings. Fi-
nally, however, “Flipsides” was
completely cancelled, and the stu-
dents were left without a station.
According to Towle, the found-
ersof WALT had always hoped to
