The DAVIDSONIAN, Sept. 10, 1919

The Passing of Cinderella

‘THE quaint little childhood tale of
the poor kitchen maid is not so
far removed from recent reality.

For we all recall the staggering piles of
dishes, the dust-strewn floor, the tubs
of clothes, the treadmill task at the
sewing machines! Yes, Cinderella-
like was the housework of yesterday.

And now, the girl of 1920 looks to
electricity —most tractable of hand-
maidens—as the fairy prince who
makes life easier and fuller.

Just a push of the button—and tiny
electric motors sweep, wash dishes
or clothes; clean, scour and polish;

While the motors do the work, other
electric appliances are distributed
about the house to make good living
more convenient. Electric cooking
utensils, hair driers, cigar lighters,
burglar alarms, door bells, and
furnace regulators, are now operated
by the magic wand of electric
power,

The development of the miniature
motors for the kitchen and electrical
devices wag made possible by the
rapid progress in experience gained
by the General Electric Company's
Engineers, whose efforts in the appli-
cation of electricity for every sort of

make ice or ice
