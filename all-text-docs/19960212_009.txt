FACULTY VOICE
Jack Perry

Ten Expectations

Ten things expected of you, the student (and soon-to-be alum):

1. Complain alot about being “stressed.” Be stressed. Davidson’s
academic reputation depends on student over-work. Write
about your stress to US News.

2. But play hard. When perspectives and donors and alumni visit,
we want you smiling. Uriless there is actually ice on the ground,
during daylight hours play peculiar team games in front of Chambers
and laugh. Note: “Play hard” does not of course extend to the point
of insobriety.

3. An unchallenged faculty member is a malcontent, right? And
what is more challenging than student resistance, mental contrary-
‘| ism, general last-minute-ism? Remember our motto “Alenda lux ubi
orta libertas” translates “I work better under pressure.” Keep the
faculty on the defensive without being actually evil.

4. Become a conservative about change on campus. Expect to
return for you tenth class anniversary — nay, your 25th — and find
nothing changed except the aging of the faculty. Practice by opposing
the new “life sciences” building on grounds it will desecrate the
hallowed Traditional Place for Commencement.

5. Conversely, become a radical about the college’s growing out
of stodgy old traditions like religion. Agitate for DCPC to become
non-denominational and for the faculty to be purged of Presbyterians.

6. Find a job right after graduation. Gloat. Nothing irritates State
U. business majors like seeing effete liberal arts types get rapid
employment. ;

7. If too proud to work, naturally move on after graduation to
several years of law school — we can’t have too many lawyers, can
we? — or a decade or two of med school. Of course grad-school-
bound students should get Watsons, Fulbrights or Rhodeses.

8. If you are Group A, join the elite right after commencement,
make prodigious amounts of money, and give mini-prodigious dona-
tions to Alma Mater.

9. If you are Group C (there was a Group B, but it is being phased
out), enter into a career of exemplary service, making no money above
sustenance but illuminating the alumni magazine with stupefying (to
Group A) accounts of good deeds and immaterial satisfaction.

10. After job-getting, and grad-school-going, and careers, and
families, and children, and middle ‘age, and success (or failure), and
fame (or lack of it) — after all of what is popularly called “life” —look
back on what happened in (and to) your mind at Davidson and decide
that it was, seen at the close of the day, the most important thing after
all.

-Jack Perry retired last summer after ten years as director of the

Dean Rusk Program and professor of Political Science. He still lives
in Davidson.

Proving faith

/

Rob Vogelbacher wrote an
article two weeks ago in which he
claimed that he was a rational guy
and that arational person wouldn’t
accept the existence of God be-
cause he/she had never seen a pic-
ture or heard of God being “de-
tected” anywhere. And as we all

know, rational people supposedly

don’t take anything on faith.

I’m not going to lecture on
why a person should believe in
God. But I am going to ask Rob
and all of you who use the same
logic he does a few questions.

I think you’ ll see where I am
going. My guess is that Rob has
not personally travelled around the
earth or even knows anyone who
has.

However; I’m sure he will tell
you that the earth is round. If I
asked Rob (whois fighting through
Organic Chem) what the basic

building block of life is, my guess,

is that he would say that it is the
carbon atom.

If I asked Rob what those
shining lights in the night sky are,
I’msure he would say that they are
huge balls of gas burning millions
of miles away:

Now Rob, like the rest of us,
most probably doesn’t understand
and couldn’t “prove” any of the
answers I assumed he would give.

He has been told this information
by teachers and read it in books and
has accepted it purely on faith.

If he has questions about God
he can talk to a pastor or look in the
most popular book in the world.
He will see dozens of first person

_ Weare all given the
choice of faith in
God ... it will be

our decision and we
will make it for our
own reasons. But it
is a mistake to jus-
tify those reasons
by saying it makes
sense to believe -

Matthew.

accounts of people who have “dis-
covered” God.

My point is that a great deal of
what we “know” has been accepted
on faith. We have either been told
itis true by our parents, teachers, or
books.

You see, its not that Rob has

no reason for faith in God, but
simply that he chooses to have no
faith.

Following along with his own
logic, his reason for believing in
the Bible is just as strong, if not
stronger, than his reason for be-
lieving in his Chemistry book
(since more people in -the world
can understand and explain the
Bible).

We are all given the choice of
faith in God and will continue to
have that choice for the rest of our
lives. Whatever our decision, it
will be our decision and we will
make it for our own reasons. Butit
is amistake to justify those reasons
by saying that it makes sense to
believe Einstein and not Matthew.

The only reason one would
believe Einstein is that he says that
he has scientific proof.

But I am willing to bet that
none of us at this school could
understand that proof if Einstein
himself presented it.

Therefore, his claim that mass
can turn into energy requires just
as much faith as Matthew’s claim
that Jesus healed a blind man. In
the end, the issue is not whether
belief in God requires too much
faith for a rational person but
whether a rational person is will-
ing to put his/her faith in God.

And we play the game

It happens every spring. It
happens where prairies and pas-
tures roll, and on the black of city
streets. It happens around the cor-
ner, in places like Billy’s backyard
and Johnson Field.

It happens when birds return
home, bringing with them what
they left with: the air that carries

them, a very certain air, one that .

smells and tastes like no other, one
that stirs the body on simply breath-
ing it. :

These are the smells and tastes
and breaths of baseball. They are
dusty leather, dugout seeds, and
dirt in your mouth. They are the

sun in left field, the stitches, red on
white, and the dust kicked up in
front of the mound on each pitch.

And so it happens. It happens
when box scores begin again to
flourish the sports page, packed
with the vital information of who’s.
playing where and who’s hitting
what, in an age where players are

bought, sold, and swapped like.

shares on Wall Street.

It happens when Earth’s fro-
zen tundra melts, releasing the parts
of us that had become a part of that
ground, that grass and dirt, and had
been preserved under snow and ice
over a long winter.

And these parts rise from the
diamond: the images, the thoughts,
the feelings, the remembrances of
successes, of failures, of battles
well-fought. These parts emerge,
raw, fresh, and with renewed vital-
ity. And they play right alongside
us.

And we play. And weare Will

‘Clark and Darren Daulton. And

when the ball flies over the wall,
for a moment as fleeting as the
ball’s path, we are the hero of the
world we’ve made for ourselves,
the only world that matters.

It is a world that has a hot
corner, a sweet spot, and a strike

zone. These places you pass in
and out of. This world has noroom
for fear or weakness: it’s only
warning is a track,

It is a universe whose horizon
is a sun-drained fence and whose
very edge is a chalky-white foul
line.

It happens when children, or
grown-up boys, bring fiery spirits
to the diamond and find them-
selves at the gritty core of it. Then
the ball he loves to grip begins to
grip him.

And he can taste the way his
sweat meets with the dirt on his
face. And it tastes like the nectar

of the gods.

And it happens when these
boys of summer fall asleep with
these scenes and soundsstill real in
their mind’s eye. And so they are
led to dreams by these images. He
sees the even field from below,
from the dugout.

He hears the scrape of metal
cleats against the concrete steps
that lead him up. And he looks out
at the sunset over right, at the twi-
light shades that sweep across the
silent sky,

And he wakes in the spring,
when he tastes something new in
the air he breathes. _
