Former hostage recounts 343 day captivity,

By DAVID WILLIAMS

Cable News Network (CNN)
official Jerry Levin spoke to
Davidson students and _ faculty
Wednesday concerning his 11-
month captivity as a hostage in
Lebanon two years ago. Levin,
who is currently stationed at
CNN’s Washington Bureau, was
formerly Middle East Bureau
Chief for CNN in Beirut when he
was taken hostage by Shiite Mos-
lem militants on March 7, 1984.

Levin said he was kidnapped
early in the morning while walk-
ing the 15-minute route between
his home in West Beirut and the
CNN Bureau. As he approached
the Saudi Arabian embassy, Levin
said he felt a tap on his shoulder.
A youth put a handgun to Levin’s
waist and shoved him into a car.
Levin was driven to a remote
Lebanon valley three or four hours
away.

Levin said his captors secured
him to a wall inside a building
with a bicycle chain and
blindfolded him. “I saw next to
nothing for the next year,” he
said. The only two rules which his
captors laid down were that Levin
should not see their faces and that
he should not ‘look out’. The cap-
tors constantly threatened him
with statements such as “You see,
we kill!” and continued to pull the
trigger of an empty gun in his
face.

Despite losing thirty pounds
while a hostage, Levin said: “I
never gave in to despair. I spent
my time thinking _ pleasant
thoughts, and I began an inward
spiritual journey. On April 10,
1984, I approached an emotional
Rubicon,” which comprised “a
newfound faith that embraced the
teachings of Jesus Christ.”

In July 1984, four months
after his capture, Levin disco-
vered why he had been taken hos-
tage. Levin’s captors forced him
to appear on a videotape asking
for Ted Turner, founder and
owner of CNN, to intercede with
the U.S. government to negotiate
the release of Shiite prisoners in
Kuwait. The prisoners in Kuwait
had been seized after their alleged
bombing of American and French
embassies there. “The demand

was terrifying,” Levin said, “be-
cause I was quite sure that it would
be difficult for the United States to
make a deal to free them.”

Levin said he knew that Presi-
dent Reagan had made an “un-
keepable promise” during the
1980 election campaign when he
said Americans would not be
taken hostage again. ‘The admin-
istration was acutely aware of the
effect the Iranian crisis had on the
1980 election, and it did not want
that to happen to Reagan in 1984.
I knew the administration’s ap-
proach [to the hostage situation]
would be quiet.”

On Feb. 13, 1985 Levin “got
the chance I had been praying
for.” Levin’s captors had been
careless with the chain that fas-
tened him to the wall. Upon
breaking free from the chain,
Levin tied three blankets together,
climbed to the roof of the building
and used the blankets to climb to
the ground and escape over the
hills.

After a few minutes he be-
came frightened when he heard
barking dogs and human voices.
However, the voices turned out to
be those of friendly Syrian sol-
diers who helped transport him to
Syria and then to West Germany.

Levin criticized the Reagan
administration for not publicizing
his captivity or negotiating with
the captors for his release or the
release of the seven “forgotten”
hostages who have been taken in
Beirut over the past two years.
“The administration has — suc-
ceeded in publicizing the myth
that our captivity was a mystery,
when it really was not,” he said.

Levin said that at least four
Americans still remain captive in
Beirut, while two others have al-
legedly been murdered. ‘The
frightened families of these hos-
tages wonder how many people it
takes to make a hostage crisis,” he
said, noting that the administra-
tion has not dealt with this crisis in
the same manner it dealt with the
TWA Flight 847 and the cruise
ship Achille Lauro hijackings.

Levin said: “As long as the
hatred of America continues to
exist, terrorism will happen. As

eliminating terrorism, the
symptoms of a broader disease,
the causes will continue, and ter-
rorism will continue.”

Levin believes that if the
Reagan administration continues
its current policy on terrorism, the
danger to Americans abroad will

only increase. At present, he said,
“our government deliberately
avoids publicizing the connecting
causes of terrorism with its ef-
fects.” He added: ‘Discussions
focus on terrorist acts and not on
their causes. I believe the result of

such silence will be the direct

esCape

cause of more killings.”

Levin urged that the adminis-
tration reconsider its policies.
“The bottom line is that neither
terror nor silence will work,” he
said. “Common dialogue and re-
conciliation will be necessary to
achieve peace.”
