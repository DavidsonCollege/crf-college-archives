backs, the defense weakened to allow the Wolfpack
a four touchdown win. Davidson fans and students,
however, can have nothing but praise for Coach Bill
Story and the Davidson squad. Beattie Feathers, State
coach, admitted after the game, “Davidson has one of
the best starting teams we have faced this season. We
beat them because we had better reserves.”

The whole line played brilliant ball. Gene Bingham
paced the line play, backing up beautifully. Shaking
loose on an intercepted pass in the first half, he. came
near to a touchdown for the Wildcats, but lacked the
necessary speed and was caught on the Pack thirteen.
Backfield play was led by Mac Erwin, Shepard, Guy,

and Bethea.

B TEAM PROSPECTS
Davidson’s B team looked good last Friday against
Belmont Abbey. Gaining experience, the Kittens’ may
be counted as strong reserves for next year’s varsity.

K. A., Beta, Phi Delt
In Three Way Tie

The first week of Inter-fra-
ternity football ended most aus-
piciously for the K. A.s and the
Betas, both of whom go into this
week’s schedule with two wins
and no losses. Runners-up for the
top honors were the Phi Delts
who downed the S. A. E.s, and
the S. P. E.s who won 30-0 over
the Pikas.

With Tuesday being a little
damp, games scheduled to be
played that day were played on
Friday. While the S. P. E.s were
romping over the Pikas with five
touchdowns, the -Kappa-Sigs—came
out on the long end of an 18-0
victory to down the Pi Kapps.

There was some controversy
over the game which the Betas
took from the Kappa Sigs in an
overtime period. But Coach Pete
Whittle decided in favor of the
Wooglin followers. The — score
came when Bill Williams snagged
a pass was heading for the goal
Tine as the final whistle blew. But
the ball was still in play, so the
Betas came out on top with a 6-0
win.

The
Kappa Sigs lost to the Betas, but
came back to beat the Pi Kapps.
At the same time, the Phi Gams
dropped their initial game with
the K. A.s, later winning over the

On the losing end of the score-
board all the way round were the
S. A. E.s and the Pi Kapps who
lost one apiece, and the Pikas and

Davidson

Wildcats

Bow To N. C. State

After performing brilliantly in
the first half, Davidsons Wildcats
dropped a bitterly contested 25-0
decision to N. C. State when
the seasoned Wolfpack smashed
through the Wildcat defense for
three last quarter scores. An au-
dience of 19,000 witnessed the ac-
tion-packed encounter under the
lights of the Riddick Stadium in
Raleigh last Saturday.

Paradoxical

as it may seem,
former Wildcat Gwyn Fletcher
was instrumental in sending his

old mates down to their first de-
feat. The erstwhile Davidson ath-
lete paced the Pack’s third quar-
ter scoring drive with his power-
ful running, and passed to Blom-
quest in the end zone for State’s
second touchdown.

Davidson Holds First Half

Davidson’s red-shirted invaders
clearly outplayed. the Wolfpack
in the scoreless first half. The
Wildcats racked up three first
downs in the opening half and
held the vaunted Turner and com-
pany completely with sterling de-
fensive play.

The ensuing boot

yard stripe. Two line plays net-
ted four yards, ‘and Davidson was
forced to punt. Bethea’s magnifi-
cent kick spiralled 57 yards down-
field in the face of a strong ¢ross
wind, and set. the Pack in their
own backyard, State’s backs were
thrown repeatedly by the inspired
Cat forwards, with the result that
the remainder of the period was
devoted-toa punting duel between
State’s Palmer and Bethea.

The first break of the game ap-
peared near the end of the second
quarter. Turner dropped back to
kick, but his hurkied punt wob-
bled off his foot and spun out
of bounds on State’s forty yard
line. Aided by a Wolfpack pen-
alty and Mac’ Erwin’s » smashes
through the center of the line, the
Wildcats worked their way to
the Pack’s twelve yard marker.
However State dug in, and took
over the ball on downs.

Bingham Intercepts Pass

State’s only scoring opportunity
came toward the of the
quarter, when Gibson surged
through to block and retrieve An-
derton’s boot. With only a minute
remaining, Turner faded back to
pass:—It-was then that Gene Bing-
ham snagged Turner's errant toss
and set sail from his own 30 on
an electrifying run. After escap-
ing two tacklers, Bingham ‘was
pulled down from behind on the
Wolfpack eighteen. Seconds were
left when Anderton hit OHair on
the State ten ribbon, and before

another play could be run, the
halftime whistle halted the Cats’
threat.

After the intermission, the

aroused Wofpack struck viciously.
Fletcher returned Betthea’s boom-
ing spiral to his own forty-five
yard line, and a scoring march
was under way. With Fletcher at
the throttle, State drove relent-
lessty forward, finally reaching
the one yard line. From _ that
point, Palmer piled over for the
touchdown and a 6-0 lead.

At the start of the second half,

intentions of winning, when Cliff

After the touchdown, the Cru-

that was good for seventy yards
and a touchdown. This was fol-
