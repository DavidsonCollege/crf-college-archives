Subsidization?

It is becoming a more and more obvious fact
every day that something must be done about
Davidson's football set-up. Our boys played
a good game out there against V.M.I. Satur-
day and deserve a world of credit for it. The
team was in good physical condition, was primed
for the game, and got its share of the breaks, so
no alibis can be offered. It must be accepted as
fact that Davidson’s simon pure, or practically
simon pure, teams cannot cope with colleges
which have hired bigger, more experienced teams
and who have plenty of reserves almost as good
ag the regulars.

In the last two years we have lost several
games by rather large scores, consequently los-
ing considerable prestige in the football world.
No one likes to see a constant loser. And that
is just? what Davidson is apt to become. The
handwriting on the wall indicates three alterna-
tives. ;

1. Subsidization. This could be done judi-
iously on a comparatively small scale without
injuring the reputation of the college, and at the
same time provide good enough teams to make
things interesting with our Big Five rivals.

2. Schedule only Small Colleges. While this
would assure us of a good record in the won and
lost columns, it would also assure a terrific drop
in gate receipts. Since Davidson depends on
the profits from the football season to carry a
large part of the remainder of the athletic pro-
gram, this might prove ruinous.

3. Drop intercollegiate football entirely,
There are many more arguments in favor of this
policy than one at first realizes, but we believe
that it would cause Davidson to lose a great deal
of prestige.

Boiled down to a nutshell the whole thing is
that we need good attendance at football games
to finance our athletics, and in order to draw
crowds we must play big time teams. The
crowd, or rather the lack of it at the Home-
coming embroglio, conclusively proved the lat-
ter point. Where do we go from here?

Lock Your Door

There is the story of the Roman emperor who

ordered a servant to repeat several times each
day in his presence, “Carthage must be de-
stroyed.” Carthage was destroyed , which fact
leads us to hope that if the statement, “Lock your
door,” is hurled at you often enough it will be
heeded.

Any group of more than six hundred and fifty
must necessarily contain some weak members.
We have a minimum of these here at Davidson,
but we must admit that they do exist. It is the
duty of the rest to help by removing the tempta-
tion. Thus, remembering to lock his door may
be considered the moral obligation of every Day-
idson student. No act will be more worthy of
the slight trouble it causes.

Note To Reporters

We hope all our reporters will read this,

John Temple Graves IT in his column in the
Birmingham Age-Herald recalls the story of
the pride that Editor Samuel Bowles always
took in the accuracy of his Springfield Republi-
can. On one occasion, when the Republican
reported the death of a citizen that turned out
to be very much alive, Editor Bowles said, “I’m
sorry, but if the Republican says he’s dead, he’s
dead.” } N
_ The only compromise the famed editor would
make, and that only after long discussion, was

Circulation Manager

to print the citizen’s name in the birth notices
the next morning.

An editor who dared to say that a man was
dead if his paper said he was dead had reporters
whose watchword was accuracy.

THANKS

We want to say thank you to the powers that
be for inviting the members of the Senior class
to. the alumni banquet on Homecoming Day.
This is the first time such an invitation has been
extended and we hope that will become a tradi-
tion. ~

PLEASE

We have tried to keep off this page things
of a critical nature, but there is something done
every night for which we can see no excuse.
That is the cutting off of the light in the clock
the north side of Chambers. Every night
this light is turned off before midnight, making it
impossible for students to see what time it is.
Many have come to depend on this clock and it
causes them some inconvenience when their time-,
piece is taken away. Since a large number of
men do not go to bed till after midnight, we
ask that the clock be left lighted until that hour
at the earliest.

“ARKANSAS TRAVELER” — Bob Burns,
Fay Bainter, John Beale, and Jean Parker.

It’s about a hobo printer who saves a widow’s
print shop from crooks.

Here is the best one, so far, of the Bob Burns
He plays a tramp printer who wanders
vaguely about, a kind of Robin Hood character,
spreading rough but sincere philosophy. In one
village he finds a widow, Fay Bainter, who sup-
ports herself and her two children with a small
print shop. But dirty politicians are planning
to take it from her.

Bob forsakes his life of gentle ease to help
her fight. There is a love interest supplied by
Jean Parker and John Beal. A family picture.

Letters To

The Editor

SUPER SNOOPINGS

Dear Bill:
The
is to have a new dormitory. That

news is out that Davidson

is fine news. There is no building

that is needed more.

Let's hope that the plans for ,the
previous dormitories have been lost.
Nothing would ruin my faith in Da-
vidson quite as much as the con-
struction of another monstrosity in
the shape of our present dormitor-
ies. How one architect could, in his
right mind, design a building like
East or West, and then point to it

as a modern college building is
quite beyond me.
First of all let's look over our

latest dormitories and see what is
wrong with them.

1. They are four stories tall. It
is unfair to make a boy walk three
flights of steps twenty times a day,
especially if he is not well. In addi-
tion to that, the noise contributed to
a building by stairs is great and
the extra flight of stairs
fifty percent more. noise.

2. The stairs go up’ the ends,
making it impossible to have dou-
ble the number of rooms with win-
dows on two sides of the room.

3. The buildings are without the
first attribute of beauty—just barns
with rooms in them.

causes

4+. There is only
with a parlor.

One dormitory

5. The lighting system is so primi-
tive that the student wiring sys-
tems—made by radios,
ete.—are an ever present danger.

6. The present buildings. are in-
efficient—hard to heat—hard
keep clean,

necessary

to

I am sure you will agree that
such facts are, in a degree at. least
true. They should be corrected. If
the new dormitory is built on the
order of East and West, it will soon
be out-of date; and the moderniza-
tion of it will cost more than the
making of it modern at the start.
Perhaps Davidson can not yet af-
ford accommodations like  thosé
at Duke; but believe you me, Da-

vidson’s reputation can not long af-
ford the exstience of Dormitories
like the present ones. We can take
a middle course, and find a better
solution. As a suggestion of what
should be, I
include the following points.

the new dormitory

1. Three stories high.

2. Silent—not metal—stairs up the
center.

3. Good looking enough to be in-

conspicuous, and with more char-
acter than a pile of bricks.

4. Two, three, or even four room
suites with a living room, and a
private bath-room. (This may cost
more now, but all the better schools
have them; and some day Davidson
must follow).

5. There should be a parlor in
which to receive guests.

6. The lighting system should pro-
vide an indirect ceiling light, con-
trolled by a switch at the door, in
every room, There should also be
enough base outlets.

7. The building should be wea-
ther stripped, and the , windows
should be of the steel-frame hinged
type.

These are all small, somewhat
expensive, improvements. Yet they
will. indicate to me whether Da-
vidson is building for the future;
or for present advertisement. It
would be far better to wait a few.
years and put up a better build-
ing, if the funds are not yet avail-
ble, than to throw up another dorm-
itory like those we now Possess.
The present buildings will have to
be altered, and so will any modeled
after them.

Therefore, Bill, let's ask all the
students to contribute their sugges-
tions to the Building Committee,
with an idea toward helping them
out. Tam sure that they would ap-
preciate our student viewpoint. In
fact, why doesn’t the Davidsonian
conduct a poll of student Opinion
on the needs of a new dormitory.

Yours,
lieiioie

In the Groove

By TOM PERRIN

DEPARTMENT OF HISTORI-
CAL RESEARCH ... Every now
and then it is impressed on us that
a large part of the student body,
including us, struggles along in
woeful ignorance of some of the
more interested and_ incidental
phases of the life of Davidson in-
stitution. Take for example the
commonly neglected case of the
college wildcat, spiritual papa of
the school’s pigskin heroes.

Felix is really his name, and “his”
is the correct pronoun. As to how
old he is there are several schools
of thought. According to the reck-
oning of old Doc Charles, the
colored trainer who looked after
him until he was succeeded by Mr.
P. W. White, he would be some

eighteen years old, while Monk
Younger, who was head coach
when Felix arrived, we gather,

estimates around twelve years.

Mr. White is the man who waters
the cat and cleans his cage, which
is, of course, just to.the north of
the gym. A boy brings Felix’s food
from the meat market and sticks it
to him through the cage. Wildcats
are strictly carnivorous, and_ this
one will ignore anything you poke
at him but meat. Only since Mr.
White's arival has the mascot been
enticed into his smaller. portable
cage and paraded about between
halves of a game. That was two
years ago, and it seems’ to have
been a good bit of trouble.

Incidentally, the “Lincoln Library”
has this to say about the wildcat,
which is a vague sort of term
for a species of lynx: “Although re-
putedly dangerous, the lynx lacks
courage...”

THE CAMPUS SCENE...
Would be improved if the sophs
who are on flag detail would take
the trouble to run the flag all the
way to the top of the staff every
morning. A visitor to the campus
Sunday was heard to wonder if
V. M. I. was in any way responsi-

| ble for the flag’s flying about a

yard below the top ... A certain
Kappa Sig is reputedly, taking all
bets, in terms of shoe shinks, on
the outcome of his frat’s remaining
touch football games—with the Phi
Gams and the. Phi Delts.

COLUMN...
Charlotte Observer with any thor-
oughness, you may see a column
in the Sunday editions called Sub-
Deb Chatter, written by Miss Peg-
gy Dunaway, who isn't exactly a
stranger to Davidson. If her piece
of last Sunday is typical, we pre-
dict a large and enthusiastic audi-
ence in these parts. She gives a
couple of nice Paragraphs to local
socialites and their elegant garb; to
save embarassment to those honor-
ed and (newspaper space) we won't
repeat her thoughts. You can learn
things about your friends from her,
though. Where else could you find
that a certain dapper young fellow
is “better known to Charlotte girls
as Boscoe, the Heart Throb?”

Hold the presses! For weeks now
we have been trying to find out
the correct method of assuming that
noncholant attitude so necessary 1n
a meéeting between date and late
date. We are overjoyed to announce
that not only have
we found out the
correct proceed-

ure for this em-
barassing moment
but we have had
a demonstration
by that emminent
authority T. A. Hackney, the Cas-
anova of the Everglades. According
to Sherlock Holmes Spencer, how-
ever, “If you leave your overcoat
and hat in the front room you are
liable to be suspicioned if not detect-
ed.” After the demonstration Mr.
Hackney expressed himself as fol-
lows: “It is most embarassing to
come out from under a kitchen
table with your shoes off.”

Fellow students, I am afraid that
| we have associated with each oth-|!
er so long that we fail to appreci-
ate the diamonds in our midst. It
takes someone apart who can look
at us in an objective way to ap-
preciate the manifold assets of cer-
tain members of our student body.
Let mé quote Miss Peggy Duna-
way in her Charlotté Observer col-
umn “Sub Deb Chatter.” “Another
of yesterday's gala events was the
dance givén in Charlotte by the
Kappa Alpha and Kappa Sigma
fraternities from Davidson. Ray-

ve in the season’s most style-right"
suit. Dick Taylor was in an outfit
so complete he looked as though
he had just stepped out of Esquire.
Paul Marion (better known to Char-
lotte girls as Bosco the Heart

mond Pittman looked unusually sua-|.

Throb!) was so good looking he
made every gal yearn to dance with
him.” My, My, is this a school of
higher learning or a glorified fash-
ion show?

Wedding bells pealed once more
around Davidson way—this time
for alumnus Fred Dennis who took
the vows with Miss Sue Batte of
Concord Friday night. Johnny Me-
Queen came dangerously near to
the altar Saturday night when his
engagement to Miss Virginia Rog-
ers was announced at the Kappa
Sig—K. A. dance. Congratulations
and best wishes all the way around.

Janitors Toil
Hard, But Are
All Satisfied

Old Cemetery Reveals Their
Faithfulness In The Past

By PAUL BUMBARGER

A necesary part of the service of
Davidson College since it was
founded over a hundred years ago,
but one taken for granted by most
of the students, has been’ the army
of janitors employed by the institu-
tion during its lifetime.

Just off the golf course belong-
ing to the college is an old, almost
forgotten negro cemetery. On close
inspection of the numerous tomb-
stones seen among the underbrush,
one may find that a great many
of them bear under the name ‘the
same inscription; “Faithful janitor
to Davidson College.”

Fourteen In Number

Today the force has grown to
one composed of fourteen men, in-
cluding a head janitor, Wesley
Smith, Wesley was at one time a
Pullman porter, but decided to set-
tle down to a stationary job. Ac-
cordingly he came into the employ-
ment of the college as a janitor.
Eaght years ago he was made head
janitor, and has been looking after
the rest of the boys ever since.

Under Wesley are thirteen others,
each having a specific dormitory or
roming house to look after. Rumple
Dormitory is in charge of Alonzo
Moore, while in Watts are John
Brice and Sidney Hunsucker. Sid-
ney’s grandfather carried the col-
lege mail to and from the post of-
fice for nearly fifty years. Toy
Withers is in Georgia;)Jordan With-
ers and John Heath are in West;
and Jim Carr and Crawford Don-
aldson are in East. Roy Caldwell
has charge of the barracks,

Many Hard Jobs

Probably the hardest jobs are
taken care of by Seymour Carr
and John Smith. These men are
in charge of cleaning the rooming
houses in town: The Club,, The
Ward, Seifert’s, and Mooney’s. Be-
sides this they look after the Eagle’s

clean Shearer Hall. Many persons
in town know them so well that
they consider them public property,
and consequently call on them from
time to time to help them with odd
jobs.

Dean of the janitors is Enoch

Nest and the Love Nest, and alsol

Donaldson, the “Enoch,” who has

been known to countless numbers
of Davidson students of all genera-
tions, and who owns a lizard pos-
sessed of marvelous powers of pro-
phecy, especially concerning the out-
come of football games. No one
knows how long Enoch has been
in the service of the college, since
he was here when everybody else
connected with the college now ar-
rivd. Dr. Shearer, one-time. Bible
professor, used to call him “my
Enoch.” Enoch is now on
duty in Chambers building, along
with a new “assistant” given him
this year, one William Donaldson.
All Satisfied

All of the janitors seemed to be
quite satisfied with their work,
though quite a few expressed a pre-
ference to be “business men” if
they had a sufficient amount of
education. Most of them are mar-
ried, and those who are not an-
nounce that they are “courtin’ hea-
vy.” Crawford Donaldson, who
works in East, now has ten chil-
dren from nine years of married
life. But when asked to name them,
he found this a job a little beyond
his capacity, being able to think of
only nine of them,

Married or unmarried, however,
all of them agree that Davidson is
the best college in the world, and
will stand behind her no matter
what happens. An example of faith
is a reply Enoch once made to Mrs.
Martin, wife of a former president
of the college, when asked how a
certain football game was coming
out: “Nothing to nothing, ma'am;
and Davidson is ahead!”

Colored Work
Expands Fast

The scout work for colored boys
under the direction of Dave Mc-
Lean is coming along nicely, Last
week-end he took the group to see
the Wofford game. The last meet-
ing at Cornelius had the largest
number present of any meeting this _
year; there were over 21 scofits
there. A camp fire program was
Presented under the supervision of
Bill McLauchlin and Albert Winn.

Plans are under way for a girl
scout troop which will begin func-
tioning in the near future. Mrs. W.
G. McGavock and Miss Julia Meb-
ane have consented to take charge
of this enterprise; however, no-
thing of a very definite nature has
been decided on yet.

The colored churches are plan-
ning to have a daily Bible school
in the near future.
