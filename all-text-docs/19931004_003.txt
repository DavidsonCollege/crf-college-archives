Students -
question role
of police

By Mandy Curtis &
Katherine Hash

After multiple clashes be-
tween students and police at
Women's Weekend, questions are
arising about the officers’ role.

According to the Police Moni-
tor Duties for 1993-1994, “The

Police Officer, with the assistance '

of the Risk Manager, will ensure
' that the Sober Monitors are com-
pleting theirduties. Any problems
will be brought to the attention of

the Monitor to be corrected. If the
problem is not corrected, the spon- |

- Soring organization(s) will be is-
sued an alcohol citation.”

As stated in the duty descrip-
tion for the police officers, “Even
while employed as a college moni-
tor, the Officer is an Official repre-
sentative of the Campus Police De-
partment and shall conform with
the requirements of that position.
At any point, if State, County, or
Local Law conflicts with the stated
policy, the Officer shall defer to
the Law.”

Campus Police reported that
only two alcohol violations were
given to students at the Dave
Matthews concert. These students
were passing cups of beer to those
who were not 21.

Warner Hall Social Chairs
Heather Galano and Cindy Ebbs,
thought that the police were “un-
necessarily” aggressive in enforce-
ment. Galano said that the police
should be there to “monitor the
party and not the alcohol.”

“There were no problems, no
one got out of hand; it was just
crowded,” stated Galano. She be-
lieves there was no need for the
police officers to be so strict.

According to Patterson Court
Adviser Kurt Holmes, there were
no major problems the night of the
Dave Matthews concert. He re-
called a few alcohol violations, but
nothing too out of the ordinary for
anall-campus party in the center of
the court.

. Campus Police has not seen
the problems that some students
believe to be there. The officers
feel that there is a better relation-
ship between students and officers
this year as a result of the changed
alcohol policy on campus.

However, some students “still
do not understand that the policy
still puts officers in the position to
act if need be,” according to Rick
Moore, head of the campus police
department.

Rowdy Frat Guys

Davidson alum finds relatioinship
between "keg-friendly" fraternities
and testosterone levels

By Mandy Curtis

“Rowdy and rambunctious”
College fraternity brothers have
higher levels of testosterone than
those guys in the “better behaved”.
Greek fraternity houses, accord-
ing to recent psychological studies
conducted by Davidson. alum,
James M. Dabbs Jr.

Through research and scien-
tific testing, Dabbs has found that
the fraternity brothers of three “par-
tying” houses have a higher aver-

age testosterone level than the

brothers of two “responsible”
houses.

Dabbs, class of 59 anda psy-
chology professor at Georgia State
University in Atlanta, has studied
the hormone testosterone and its
link to aggression in human be-
havior for years. He has found, in
looking at fraternities, that there is
a correlation between the levels of
testosterone and the actions of the
members of the houses,

'Acampus interfraternity coun-
cil, at an anonymous college,
helped Dabbs to identify five dif-
ferent fraternities with various ste-
reotypes. Two of the five were

labeled at the “goody-goody” end

and three were known to be “keg-
friendly,” according to the August
23 report from USA Today. ..;

Dabbs took testosterone
samples from 100 brothers in the
five different Greek houses. The
average level of the male hormone
was higher in those houses that
held an average of 33 parties in the
previous year, versus 10.5 for the
"responsible" ones.

Those brothers in the fraterni-
ties with three times as many par-
ties in the last year were also re-
ported to have lower grade point
averages, and they were less likely
to be smiling in their yearbook
picture.

According to Dabbs, the low
testosterone level fraternities were

more likely to have friendly facial
expressions, good grades, commu-
nity service awards, and leader-
ship qualities.

The reason for looking at the
testosterone levels of guys in fra-
ternitiesis especially interesting to
Dabbs. Evidence from the test-
osterone testing proves that the
stereotypes of fraternities do not
precede the actions; the stereotypes
are the result of the actions,

Dabbs has studied the test-
osterone levels contained in the
saliva of prisoners, doctors, minis-
ters, actors, construction workers,
chess players, lawyers, military
veterans, two chimpanzees, and
college students. :

His intentions are to examine
the correlation between testoster-
one levels and aggressive, anti-
social behavior.

Testosterone effects people’s
actions through the brain; recep-
tors in the brain are signaled by
testosterone and the behavior is
the result. The hormone can trig-
ger people to lose patience and
control. Dabbs and his associates
believe that the levels of testoster-
one establish the main differences

between men and women. Al-
though testosterone is usually as-
sumed the hormone of men,
women also have testosterone in
smaller quantities compared to
men.
Dabbs' next endeavors may
include looking at the testosterone
levels of women of sororities as
well as the girlfriends of fraternity
brothers. According to Dabbs, he
is interested in “testosterone and
the temper of the group.”

Dabbs admits that his studies
in psychology have advanced since
his days at Davidson cleaning up
after rats in the psychology labs.
He says, “Davidson isa very peace-
ful place."

He adds, "It is a very improb-
able origin from which one would
goontostudy testosterone.” How-
ever, he is grateful to his under-
graduate work that sparked his in-
terest in the study of human behav-
ior.

International festivities heighten

By Court McBryde
Twenty-four countries estab-
lished themselves in the Union on
October 2nd from 11 a.m. until 3
p-m. as Davidson College students

transformed the Union into an In-
ternational Festival. ac

The 1993 International Festi-
val welcomedall students, faculty,
and community. The Union spon-
sored this event and provided nec-
essary money for the creation of
each country’s booth. The Inter-
national Committee of the Union
planned and directed the event to
show the cultural and social part of
the international scene.

Each booth was represented
by at least one Davidson student
from that country. The displays
occupied two floors of the Union:
the Morrison Room, Europe; Big
Screen Room, Latin America/Aus-
tralia; the Conference Room, Af-
rica; and the 900 Room, Asia.
Students talked about their coun-
tries to visitors while they explained

the features of their booths.

_ Books, maps; pictures, arti-
facts, clothing, money, art, and
music were just some of the high-
lights found on display from par-
ticularcountries. However, a main
attraction of most booths was food.
Most countries had prepared a

national Festival was the dance
performances in the 900 Room.
Twointernational dances were pre-
formed:- "On A Raga Tip" and
"Sechaba."

This festival also included

activities for children. Davidson
students painted faces with inter-
national flags and made buttons
with a person’s name written in a
different language.
Dev, a native from India, said this
festival has been going on every
year she has been at Davidson and
before that too.

“It is a time to bring interna-

awareness

tional students together and give a
taste to America what our culture
isabout and share with others where
we come from, but most impor-
tantly to share a few moments of
cultural diversity,” Dev explained.
semester there will be an event
with a similar theme called “Inter-
national Night” which will encom-
pass stage performances from vari-
ous countries.

International Student Association
gives students a voice and a community -

By Wendy Lee
With the creation of the new
International Student Association
(ISA), international students, who
have been at Davidson for over 30

"years, will now have an organized
body to voice their opinions to

Residence Life, Registrar, Dean of
Students, Financial Aid, Admis-
sions, SGA, and other campus
organizations.

ISAsecks to improve the qual-
ity of the Davidson experience for
international students, strengthen
interaction between internationals
and the rest of the Davidson Col-
lege community, and promote glo-
bal awareness.

The SGA unanimously ap-

proved ISA’s charter. This means
that ISA can apply formuch needed
funds from the Activities Tax
Council.

Key areas of interest for ISA
are: housing forinternationals dur-
ing Christmas, an intern ational stu-
dent career network, orientation
for internationals, and obtaining a
van for internationals to use for
transportation to and from the air-
port and for emergencies.

Internationals are automati-
cally members of ISA, yet mem-
bership is open to any Davidson
student. ISA founding president
Don Jayasinghe said that the pri-
mary purpose of the association is
“to act as a support group for Inter-

national students, yet we are open
to anyone who supports interac-
tion between internationals and
Americans.”

Other officers of ISA are: Vice
President Devjani Dev, Secretary
Li Lin Lee, Treasurer’ Jorge
Thiermann, Senior Representative
Jorge Pardo, Junior Representa-
tive Ranjit Narayanan, Sophomore
Representative Krista Tihanyi,
Freshman Representative Dahlia
Sherif, One-Year Student Repre-
sentative Slav Brisuick.

Ruth Pittard, Assistant Dean
for international studentsis the staff
adviser, and Dr. Alberto Hernandez
is the faculty advisor. The Chair of
the International Committee,
Katrina O’Neil, will serve as an
ex-officio to ensure coordination
and cooperation between the two
organizations. Jayasinghe claims
that the International Committee
does an excellent job celebrating
cultural diversity through programs
and acting as a support group or a
representative body for interna-
tional students. ISA wascreated to
fill that vacuum.

ISA also hopes to implement
an International big brother/big
sister program and begin an Inter-
national Newsletter. Association
meetings are every Friday at 3:30
in the Union Conference Room.
