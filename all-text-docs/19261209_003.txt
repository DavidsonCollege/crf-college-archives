CROSS-COUNTRY LETTERS

The selection of five crogs-Pountry
|men to be awarded letters was made by
the athletic council at the meeting this
j week, These men were’ W. C. Penn,
W. M. Treverton, J. L. Ely, D. F. Martin,
jand J. B. Webb, These men will be en-
titled to wear the varsity “D” with the
letters “C. C.”
| Although — this
| team lost two of its meets, yet in defeat-
ing Wofford, it won the first meet ever
{ever won by a Davidson cross-country
{team, The other two meets with Duke
State were lost by comparatively
small margins. Only Webb and Trever-
ton will be lost by graduation this year
|and next year’s team will be build around
| Martin, Ely, and Penn as a nucleus. These
}men will also bid fair to win berths on
|this year’s track’ team.

This is the first year that the cross-
| country team has received letters. How-
| ever, it was decided to award these let-
ters because of the great amount of ef-

track team in their training.

BLOND gentlemen and dark-haired gentlemen,
diffident* freshmen and august seniors . . .
Prince Albert is the: overwhelming campus-
favorite of every type and every pipe. (Yes,
the pipes do have a voice in the matter. They
can act in a docile, friendly manner or they can
be mean. It depends on what you feed them.)

Open a tidy red tin of good old P. A. That
first fragrant whiff will tell you why gentlemen
prefer Prince Albert. Tuck a load into the bowl
of your pipe and light up. Fragrance and taste
alone are enough to win you.

But P. A. doesn’t stop there. It is cool-
smoking. It is mild as Maytime, yet it has
plenty of body. It is kind to your tongue and
throat. You can hit it up all you like and it
never hits back. Try a tin of P. A. You'll

certainly prefer it after that.
*Not too diffident.

P. A. is sold everywhere in
tidy red tins, pound and half-

pound crystal-glass humidors
with sponge-moistener top.
And always with every bit

of bite and %arch removed by
the Prince Albert process.
