FOOTBALL, from page 8

Wright scored on a two-yard run in the third quarter and
Ralph Isernia took a reverse 20 yards for the second
Davidson touchdown to bring the Cats within a touchdown
and.an extra-point of a tie.

However, the Cats’ last opportunity for a victory or a tie
failed. With first and ten from their own 36, the Cats were
unable to mount a drive and the Quakers took over on
downs four plays later.

With an 0-6 record, Davidson closes out the season with
four of its toughest games against Colgate, Bucknell, East
Tennessee State, and the number seven team in I-AA
Lafayette.

CROSS-COUNTRY, from page 8

Cornish agrees, adding that “we stress running our best
races at the end of the season.”

' Andrew will try to prepare his teams for competition in

.the largest of all the NCAA regions with the remaining

meets of the regular season, the next of which is Saturday,
October 29 at Davidson. The Wildcats will host Brevard,
Emory & Henry, J.C. Smith, Lenoir-Rhyne, St. Francis,
and Wofford. The women start at 10 a.m. on the field
hockey-_field with the men following at 10:45.

By the time the Regionals roll around, Andrew is count-
ing on the fact that his runners will have learned from their
limited experiences and Wildcats’ youthful Achilles’ heel
will have disappeared. “We have the nucleus for two good
teams over the next few years with all of the freshmen that
we have.”
