NOTED ORCHESTRA |¥~

HERE FOR FROLICS | —

Ray Anthony and his or-
chestra will bring their own
brand of musical magic back
to Davidson this year for

Spring Frolics, April 16 and|
17, Interfraternity Council|'

President Charlie Hassell an-
nounced this week.

Anthony, who was an_ instan-
taneous hit at last year’s Spring
Frolics, with a variety of numbers
ranging all the way from his fa-
mous “Bunny Hop” to his rendi-
tion of “Slaughter on Tenth Ave-
nue,” will be back with many of
the same featured performers.

The schedule of the weekend,
according to IFC President Has-
sell, will follow the same plan as
have previous IFC dances this
year, with the formal dance Fri-
day night, the informal Saturday,
and the extremely popular concert
on Saturday afternoon in Cham-
bers Auditorium.

Accompanying Bandleader An-
thony for the Spring Frolics week-
end will be vocalists Tommy Mer-
cer and Marcie Miller, the Sky-
liners, the Anthony Choir, and
“Brother Lee Roy” on the baritone
saxaphone.

Billed as the “Young Man With
a Horn,” Anthony stresses versa-
tility in his music, his orchestral
presentations running the gamut
from jazz and swing to novelties
and sweet ballads for a well-
balanced musical program designed
to please almost every taste.

Showmanship, neglected by so
many dance bands, is an im-
portant feature of the Anthony
crew. Ray goes to extremes to
provide a maximum of visual ap-
peal with his music, utilizing such
gimmicks as parading the band
through the aisles of the theaters.

In a comparatively short span of
the time the Anthony aggregation
has won acclaim as America’s top
band in sports, radio, television,
motion pictures and on records.
Ray’s annual itinerary now in-
cludes prom dates at the leading
colleges and universities through-
out the country and a circuit of
repeat engagements at such lead-
ing name band emporiums as the
Paramount Theater and the Cafe
Rouge of the Hotel Statler in New
York, Frank Dailey’s Meadowbrook
in New Jersey and the famed
Hollywood Palladium.The band has
also been featured in Universal

WILSON, SPENCER
VIVISECT McCARTHY

In an after-vesper session Sun-
day evening, Feb. 28, Prof. Iain
Wilson will lead a discussion on
this week’s most crucial question,
“Where is McCarthyism leading
us?” Dr. Sam Spencer, probably
the foremost campus authority on
McCarthy the man, will act as a
factual resource leader while Prof.
Wilson will seek to interpret this
latest “ism” on the American
scene, speaking from his first-
hand experience with similar poli-
tical philosophies in Europe and
from his impressions as a Britisher
of this new force in American
thinking.

Although Prof. Wilson admits
that the current European view
of McCarthyism may be somewhat
out of proportion, he ‘questions
that most Americans are seeing
the force in proper perspective. Dr.
Spencer has pointed out that Mec-
Carthy the man and McCarthy the
“ism” may be two different things
and require separate analysis.
Both have urged the absolute
necessity of straight student think-
ing on the issues involved, not
only because we are formative citi-
zens, but particularly because of
the form McCarthyism has taken
in attacks on the university and
liberal education.

Students and faculty are cordial-
ly invited to attend this discussion
and present their views. The
group will meet in the Student
Lounge of the church immediately
following vespers. Coffee will be

served.

ew Business Department
To Be Formed For 1954-55

A Department of Business Ad-
ministration has been formed at
Davidson under the chairmanship
of Professor Fred S. Morton.

The operation of this new de-
partment begins at once, although
the program and major require-
ments of it will not become effec-
tive until the next college year.
The program will affect the rising
junior class.

Major requirements for gradua-
tion with a B.A. under the new
department will include the “core
courses” of B.A. 31-32 (Account-
ing), 41 (Organization), 42 (Fi-
nance), 43 (Production), 51 (Mar-
keting), aud any other six hours in
Rusiness Administration or Eco-
nomics.

Economics 21-22 will be a pre-
requisite for all work in Business

the catalogue.

In the major core courses, the
“case method” of instruction will
be used. This method centers
around class discussion of in-
dividual business situations, and
outside reading and preparation
for the discussion.

Through the case method, it is
hoped that the students will not
only learn the facts but that they
will learn how to deal intelligently
with the facts. The case method
will stimulate thinking, making
the atudent reach decisions and
express his ideas.

The new department expects to
maintain contacts with business
leaders, to bring in guest lecturers
to classes, and to make class visits
to nearby business enterprises.

The main reason for the found-

Administration except B.A. 31-32,/ ing of the new department centers

but it cannot be counted in the
twenty-four hours required for the
major. It should be takei in the
sophomore year.

Minor requirements will include
Psychology 21 and 52 (Industrial
Psychology) and any six hours
above the ‘basic requirements
chosen from departments listed in

around the fact that from one third
to one half of the graduating busi-
ness majors go directly into busi-
ness from Davidson without further
training. It is hoped that by the
case method the student will get
a better picture of how the busi-
ness world operates and that he
will be led to participate more in

class and accept greater responsi-

bilities in his academic work; thus
he will be better prepared to go
into business upon graduating.

Plans are being made for all
rising juniors wishing to major in
Business Administration to have a
meeting this spring in order that
they may learn more of the pro-
gram of the new department.

It is expected that new per-
sonnel will be added to the de-
partment to help handle instruc-
tion by the case method.

A Board of Business Advisors
will be appointed to help advise
the new department as to new
ideas and trends in business. This
board will be one of the main
contacts of the Business Adminis-
tration Department with the busi-
ness world.

Professor Morton, chairman of
the newly formed department,
graduated from Davidson in 1943.
He attended Harvard Law School
for two years, received his Masters
at Harvard School of Business
where he was an assistant profes-
sor, and is now working on his
doctorate. He came to Davidson as
an associate professor in 1951.

To Speak af Vespers

By AL MYERS

The Reverend David A. Mace-
Lennan, who is now professor of
preaching and pastoral care at the
Yale University Divinity School,
will speak at Vespers on Sunday,
February 28.

Mr. MacLennan acts as guest
preacher in many Protestant
churches of the U.S.A. and Canada,
and also as lecturer to clergy.

Mr. MacLennan, a native of Bos-
ton, Massachusetts, graduated from
the University of Manitoba, Win-
nipeg in 1926. He was ordained
into the ministry of the Presby-
terian Church, U.S.A., in 1927, and
in the following year he did grad-
uate work at Harvard Divinity
School.

Mr. MacLennan has ‘been minis-
ter of churches in both the United
States and in Canada. During
World War I he was chairman of
the Interchurch Committee of the
Citizens Committee for troops in
training, and he is now a reserved
Army chaplain.

From 1946 to 1949 he was na-
tional chairman of the United
Church of Canada Committee on
Missionary Education. For several
years he has been affiliated with
the governing boards of various
Canadian schools. In his present
work. at Yale, he is training di-
vinity students in the art of preach-
ing and in the duties of a mibhis-
ter.

In 1943 Dr. MacLennan received
the honorary degree of Doctor of
Divinity from the University of
Toronto. Previously, in 1936, he
had received the Bachelor of Da-
vinity Degree from the United
Theological College at McGill Uni-
versity. Yale University awarded
him an honorary M.A. in 1949.

Mr. MacLennan, the author of
several books and articles, has con-
tributed to religious publications in
the United States and Canada. His
book of sermons, No Coward Soul,
was published in 1949; and a book
on the preacher’s task, A
Preacher's Primer, in 1950.

He is author of devotional book-
lets issued by the National Coun-
cil of Churches, the Presbyterian
Church in the U.S.A., and the
United Church of Canada.

In 1952 his book, Joyous Adven-
ture, was published.

SCRIPT 'N PRANKS

TO STRESS HUMOR

Davidsonians may look forward
to a highly entertaining issue of
Seript ‘n Pranks shortly after
spring holidays, according to the
editor, T. Alden Williams. The
issue will be released in the first
week or two of April and wiil vary
from the last issue by containing
more pictures, cartoons, and jokes.

This issue will not be a parody
on any legitimate commercial
magazine as a former issue was,
but it may contain portions of
parody within the magazine. It
will deal in part with military
service, with which, as Editor
Williams puts it, “we are all con-
cerned, either in commission or
omission.”

One of the best features of the
spring issue will be Don Mahy’s
cover, which will be, as all of his
covers are, near classic. If the issue
is up to former standards it may
be a pace-setter for other college
magazines; the first college maga-
zine in 3-D published by Davidson
last year was followed this winter
by a 3-D issue of the Ohio State
Sundial.

Cooperating in new capacities to
make the spring issue of Seripts
‘n Pranks both interesting and en-
tertaining to its readers will be
Gene Auten, who has been pro-
moted to the post of chief photog-
rapher for the magazine, and Phil
Lee, who was recently added to
the editorial staff.

High School Musicians

Over two hundred and fifty high
school boys and girls will be here

The contestants will be judged
on a scale ranging from “superior”
to “below average” by three
judges, one of whom is to be Mr.
John Satterfield of the Davidson
Music Department. Similar contests
are to be held at Duke ‘and West
Carolina Teachers College.

gram for presentation in schools
and a sacred program for churches.
The songs to be sung will range

uals. Leighton McCutchen, Thorny
Frick, Alan Sparks and Bob
Crutchfield will sing the solo parts.

Poister To Present

As their first production of 1954,
the Red and Black Masquers will
present “The Hasty Heart,” .John
Patrick’s comedy-drama in three
acts on March 8 and 9 in Cham-
bers Auditorium.

The play is under the direction
of Robert Mims. The advisor is
Professor Raymond W. Tyson, and
Martin McGirk is acting as stage
manager for the production.

The cast of characters includes
Lacklen, Dick Dabney; an orderly,

Sandy McGeachy; Yank, Ed Had-}.

ley; Digger, Harrold Hall; Kiwi,
Allie Cone; Blossom, Charlie
Oliver; Tommy, Fred Summers;
Margaret, Mrs. Sam MaGill; and
a colonel, Buddy Liles.

The action takes place in a con-
valescent ward in a temporary
British General Hospital some-
where within the South-East Asia
Command.

The play centers around young
Lacklen McLacklen, a Scotsman. He
is suffering from a severe kidney
disease, having had one kidney re-
moved. The other kidney is serious-
ly defective. Although he does not
know it, he has only a few weeks
in which to live.

“Lackie” is a very lonely per-
son, having no friends or family,
and is very bitter at the world.
His only interest in life is a farm
back in Scotland which he has been
purchasing on the installment plan.
Throughout the war he had been
putting all of his earnings into the
farm so that he would be a land-
owner when he returned to Scot-
land.

The authorities grasp the situa-
tion and place Lacklen in a ward
where the men are very friendly,
hoping thereby to make “Lackie”
happy for the last few weeks of
his life.

“The Hasty Heart” is the story
of the efforts of those men in at-
tempting to make friends with
“Lackie” and to help him through
his difficulty.

Return of Fields?

The Devidsonian learned to-
dey that more than oe half-
dozen books on golf have been
taken from the library. Li-
brarien Chalmers Davidson
asked the co-operation of stu-
dents in finding and return-
ing these books. They had not
been checked out.

lege. Under the plan proposed by
the trustees, the college would fill
the quota if contributions did not
fill it.

The proposal marks a departure
from past athletic policy. Athletic
grants-in-aid have been entirely
dependent upon contributions in
the past.

No official statement was avail-
able from the administration or
the athletic department late Fri-
day afternoon.

The complete text of the state-
ment of the Trustees of Davidson
College follows:

“The Trustees of Davidson Col-
lege would declare afresh their
deep conviction as to the import-
ance of a successful program of
intercollegiate athletics at our
college.

“A joint committee of the trus-
tees and faculty of the college is
now engaged in a study of the
athletic program and policies of
the institution. We do not seek to
anticipate its report. In the mean-
while, however, it is important
that there be no interruption in
the present program of the col-
lege because of uncertainty as to
the exact details of the report.

“If Davidson is to be a force
for good in the world of inter-
collegiate athletics, it must lead
from a position of strength rather
than from weakness. We believe
that under our present able coach-
ing staff real progress will be
made during the .next few years
without lowering of academic or
moral standards unless the neces-
sary support of athletics is with-
held.

“We, therefore, ask that for the
coming year the college under-
write at least thirty thousand dol-
lars for grants-in-aid for football
and at least five thousand dollars
for grants-in-aid for basketball and
that the alumni and friends of the
college be urged by the adminis-
tration, the alumni office, and the
trustees to provide the whole of
that amount.

“We would call upon the stu-
dent body, the alumni, and the
faculty to give their loyal support
to the athletic director, the
coaches, and the atheltic teams of
the college to the end that success
may be attained and that inter-
collegiate sports may again make
their proper and vital contribution
to the life of the institution.”

Dublin Players To Present
Shaw’s Pygmalion | Mar. 3

“I come from ahold family of
artists in the theatre,” says Ann
Elsden, youngest member of The
Dublin Players, arriving here to
perform in George Bernard Shaw's
“Pygmalion.” This performance
will be given in Chambers Audi-
torium on Wednesday, March 3, at
8:15 p.m.

“My mother was a co-performer
with Greer Garson, my uncle was
the most famous musical comedy
performer in Australia, and my
cousin is Mona Barrie, the Ameri-
can film actress, so you can see
why I chose the theatre as my
career,” says Ann, who is as beau-
tiful as she is vivacious.

“{ was born in India, and grew
up with almost as many American
children playmates as English or
Irish, so naturally I am glad to
come to America to see this great
country.

“We are being treated wonder-
fully well by everyone here, with
lovely parties and dinners. I know
that I will love every minute of
our tour, although it is a long
one.”

Ann says she cannot imagine the
great distances that the company
travels from city to city.

‘I am beginning to wonder
whether I brought enough clothes,

and the right kinds, because every-
one tells me that you have every
kind of weather here,” says Miss
Elsden. But it is certain that Ann
will never be cold on tour, be-
cause her beauty and personality
should insure that any number of
young men will be ready to lend
her a coat at the first shiver.

All seats for “Pygmalion” will
be reserved. There will be a spe-
cial price of $1.00 for faculty
members, students, and dates.
These tickets will be distributed
on a first come, first serve basis.
They may be obtained now from
the office of the College Union.

“Pygmalion” is Shaw’s re-crea-
tion in modern English setting of

La.

“PYGMALION”

the mythological tale of the youth
Pygmalion who fell in love with
a beautiful statue of his own
creation, Galatea. In the modern
version, Miss Elsden plays the role
of an English girl picked up in the
gutters (the Galatea of mythology)
whom a “gentleman of quality” at-
tempts to refashion in the manner
of elite society.

Ann has played principally in
English repertory and English
films before she joined The Dub-
lin Players. Her latest film is “The
Sword and the Rose” which Walt
Disney produced and filmed in
England and which has just been

released here.
