THE DAVIDSONIAN,

February 19, 1920.

SHORT HISTORY OF LAST FIVE
CONFERENCES.

Much Good Being Done by These
Yearly Meetings.

Queen’s, 1915; Normal, 1916;
Greensboro, First Presbyterian
Church, 1917; Elon, 1918; Guilford,
1919; Davidson, 1920.

The writer was privileged to at-
tend the Laymen’s Missionary Con-
vention in Charlotte in 1915. At the
same time that this was meeting the
Student Volunteers were holding
their session at Queen’s or in the
Second Presbyterian Church. There
were not so many there but in con-
nection with the Laymen’s Conven-
tion it was a wonderful experience. |

The following year the scene
shifted to Greensboro and to the
North Carolina College for Women
—then the State Normal. This

roved to be a genuine “hot-bed of

ospitality.” The conference was
great but about the greatest thing:
around there was the enormous din- |
ing hall into which the delegates;
were led one evening. They were
seated at one long table extending;
down the middle of the room. There ,
need be no elaboration of this fea-,
ture but it can be said that “They
certainly did show us a good time.”

No wonder everybody crowded
back to Greensboro in 1917 for the
next annual conference. Who could.
stay away? This time the sessions
were held in the First Presbyterian

CONFERENCE INFORMATION

A VOLUNTEER CATECHISM.

Who are Volunteers?

Volunteers are those who have
signed The Declaration Card.

What is The Declaration Card?

The Declaration Card is a state-
ment of a purpose, God’ willing, to
become a Foreign Missionary re-
corded by The Student Volunteer
Movement.

What is The Student Volunteer
Movement ?

The Student Volunteer Movement
was organized a generation ago as
an organization of students under
the inspiration of Mr. Robt. P. Wil-
der, a Princeton man. Mr. Wilder
has since become secretary of this
Movement which has been so used
of God to mould missionary thought
and inspire missionary activities in
the student life of North America.

What tangible form has the Move-
ment?

The headquarters are at 25 Madi-
son Ave., New York. John R. Mott
is chairman of the Executive Com-
mittee and a leading spirit of the
Movement. This office is organized
to serve thé many volunteers
scattered throughout the country
and does so in three principal ways:

1. Information is given and sold
to those interested in the printed
form of pamphlet or book and
through the personal letter.

Don’t plan to “get” all you can

Don't come to the Conference
without plenty of “pep.”

delegations that reported practically
no Volunteers when they came—and
snearly all Volunteers before they
left.

Next at Guilford—and the number
had increased to one hundred and.
twenty-five. It looked for a while:
like there would be no conference,
but things changed and there was a
conference and a great one at that.

Those who have attended one or;
more of these conferences know!
that this article has nothing more |
than to tell where the last few con-
ferences have been held. At last!
Davidson is privileged to serve as
host. She has a noble heritage to
follow—Will she fail? No, because
there is too much behind her.

The local Volunteer Band has’
during the last few years stood un-
challenged as the largest Band in
any college the size of Davidson in
the United States. Since 1916 there
have been thirteen volunteers, who
were alumni of Davidson, to sail to
the foreign field.

In addition to this there have been
several Davidson men on the Staff
of Officers of the Union. P. Frank
Price, ‘15, and his brother, J. P.
Price, 17, were both president. J.
R. Woods, '18, and R. E. McCture,
then °19 have served as treasurer.

QUESTION BOX.

Some one asked about money.

It will of course cost the dele-
gates their railroad fare. In ad-
dition each delegate will pay one
dollar registration fee. Davidson is
glad to furnish entertainment for
the delegates, and for many reasons
which you would know if you were
at Davidson, it is imperative that
you let us know in advance of your
coming. What ever other expenses
you want to make are your own
affair.

ferences, partly by individual dona-
tions, and partly by the sale of liter-
ature from the home office.

What is its Watchword?

“The Evangelization of World in
this Generation.’

What are its aims?

Dr.
marize

.* To awaken and maintain
among all Christian students in the
United States and Canada intelligent
and active interest in foreign mis-
sions.

2. To enroll a sufficient number
of qualified volunteers to meet the
successive demands of the Mission
Boards of North America.

3. To help all such intending
missionaries in preparing for their
life work.

4. To lay an equal burden of
responsibility on all students who
are to remain at home.

What class of people should be
attracted by this Movement?

Every wide-awake man or wo-
man who has cnouge world vision to

see beyond his or her sphere of|

activity should be attracted to a
movement which in itself is an im-
portant of the greatest and noblest
task that has ever faced mankind—
The Evangelization of the Whole
Wide World.

THE SPEAKERS WILL BE HERE
| DON’T MISS THEM.

Who are coming from head-
quarters ?

Some old friends, of course. -

Ask any delegates who attended
the Elon and Guilford Conferences
if they remember J. Lovell Murray
and Miss May Fleming. Miss Flem-
ing is one of the traveling sec-
retaries of the Student Volunteer
|Movement. She knows Missions
| from a first hand knowledge. In the
‘past few months she has been visit-
ing collleges in the interest of the
Movement.

As to Mr. Murray, an Elon dele-
gate will recall that he was one of
the moving spirits of the conference.
Ask a Des Moines delegate and you
will learn that this same man had
charge of the literature exhibit in
the Auditorium. Mr, Murray is an
intelligent, missionary enthusiast.
He is an interesting speaker and a
great attraction to add to the con-
ference.

These two will come as personal
representatives of the New York
office of the Movement. Of course
there will be other well informed

speakers to bring messages to in-
terest the conference.

Even before the conference it
would not be amiss to offer a vote of

The faculty at its last meeting
took the following action with ref-
erence to the men in the band:

Where a student during the past
term has been giving satisfactory
service in the band, as a member of
the R. O. T. C., but has not taken
theoretical work, now takes up his
theoretical work, continuing band
work and passes it all successfully’
this term, the faculty will give him
the same scholastic credit as is given
to other students, namely, credit for
one term’s work in one ticket, for
the session’s work in R. O. T. C.
