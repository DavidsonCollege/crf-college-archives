DAVIDSON
YESTERDAY AND TODAY

Article II—Publications.

The purpose of this, the second install-
ment, is to give a brief summary of the
publications, and their contents, edited
at Davidson during the past fifty years,
paying special attention to items of in-
terest appearing during the collegiate
year 1895-96, 25 years ago.

Fifty years ago we find only one paper
being published by the students, it be-
ing known as “The Davidson Monthly.”
At that by-gone date there was no
“Livest Wire on the Hill" as we have to-
day. The Davidson Monthly contained
all news as well as the literary produc-
tions of the students. The only other
publication on the campus was the
Davidson College Catalogue, which serv-
ed the same purpose then as it does at
present.

The Davidson College Monthly was
begun in 1870 and lasted two and one-
half years. It was edited by six mem-
bers of the senior class. These editors
were not chosen by the student body as
they are today but by the Eumenian
and Philanthropic Literary societies,
three from each. For nearly 14 years
there was no student publications at all.
In 1886 the Davidson Monthly was reviv-
ed and has been published every year
since. It’s name has now been changed to
The Davidson College Magazine, the best
college magazine in the south.

We will now proceed with some of the
interesting material contained in these
ancient publications.

Among those winning honor for the
year 1893-94, as shown in the catalogue
for 1894-95, is M. E. Sentelle, who is now
Dean of the college and instructor of
Bible. Dr. Sentelle won the debater’s
medal and the Biblical medal, and was
Valedictorian of his class. .

The Davidson Monthly for the year
1895-96,—25 years ago— shows A. Currie
as vice-president of the Philanthropic
Literary Society and also one of the six
editors of the aforesaid magazine. The
January issue of that collegiate year
contains a fine bear story by him, “Ray-
mond’s Artistic Adventure.”

The Monthly for October of the same
year contains the following interesting
item: “Dr. W. R. Grey, our professor of
Latin and French, spent his vacation
studying and traveling in Europe. Since
his return he has been united in mar-
riage with Miss Nannie M. Wharey, of
Mooresville. The ceremony was per-
formed September the fifth, in the Pres-
byterian church, Mooresville, by the
father of the bride, Rev. J. M. Wharey,
D.D. Mrs. Grey is well known to many
in Davidson, and their large circle of
friends extend to them a hearty welcome
to our classic town.”

The February issue carries an article
by T. W. Lingle, ‘93, our present instruc-
tor of French, on “Life and Work at a
Representative Northern University.” In
the May number there is also an article
by him on “Co-Education at a Univer-
sity.”

The February number contains the
following significant quotation: “Prof.
Woodrow Wilson, who was a student at
Davidson in '77, has been chosen to
deliver the annual series of lectures be-
fore the School of History and Politics
at Johns Hopkins. His lectures will
treat of ‘The Theory and Organization of
locat Governments.”

In the March issue, Dr. C. R. Harding,
who was then, as now, a professor at
Davidson, wrote an article, “The Man,”
in memoriam of Col. Wm. J. Martin.

It will be noted that the above quota-
tions of 2§ years ago, there being lack
of space, in the present article, to re-
view more than one year's work. The
year 1895-96 was selected at random
merely to give an idea to present read-
ers of the Davidsonian as to what was
happening on the hill in days gone by.
The next article of this series will be on
“Campus Life.”

TENT-PITCHING,
GUARD MOUNT

And Sham Battle to Feature Inspec-
tion on ember 3.

Wednesday, November 24, stan@s out
signally in things military at Davidson
College for the year 1920-21, because on
that date H. R. Smalley, major cavalry,
assistant to the inspector R. O. T. C.,
Fourth Corps Area, made his inspection
of the unit at this college, and expressed
many very favorable comments on its
standing, both from the point of appear-
ance and training.

From the fact that no especial prepa-
ration was made for this inspection and
that during the regular drill period that
day the inspector called the various
companies from their scheduled work
for the purpose of inspecting their per-
formance, this report speaks very highly
for our unit, and confers no little credit
on the battalion commander, the com-
pany commanders, and their assistant
officers and non-commissioned officers.

This report of course is made with the

view in mind of the very small amount,

of training the battalion has had to date.

The ultimate attainment of any R. O.
T. C. unit is to earn enough credits to
allow its institution to be rated as a dis-
tinguished college, an honor held by only
a small proportion of the colleges main-
taining R. O. T. C. units.

Some of the criticisms and suggestions
made by the inspector will indicate in
just what manner we at Davidson Col-
lege must extend and improve to enable
us to win that honor.

Criticiems

1. Armory, best in this arca.

2. Saluting particularly good.

Manual of arms good with the excep-
tion of a few stragglers.

4 Physical exercises, satisfactory.

. Suggestions

1. Deem it necessary to have an in-
door rifle range.

2. No college can distinguish unless
they maintain:

(a) An assembly room capable of seat-
ing the entire unit, and available for this
purpose.

(b) Out of doors rifle range for light
charge ammunition, at least 200 yards
tong.

(c) A machine gun range of at least
1,000 inches.

(d) A pistol range of at least $o yards.

The inspector has to date visited 32
schools and colleges, so has excellent
material for his commendations and
criticisms.

He also expressed a desire that as
many as possible of the schools in this
corps area make an especial effort to

attain distinguished ratings, he himself |.

will put forth every effort to assist the
various units in the attainment of this
honor.

SERG. W. T. JOHNSON
RECEIVES WELL
EARNED PROMOTION

First Sergeant William T. Johnson has
been appointed a second lieutenant in
the infantry. He will stay at Davidson
as a special assistant to Captain Hearn.
His duties heretofore have been keeping
the files and other stenographic work.
Sergeant Ryan will take his place at
this.

Lieutenant Johnson went down to Co-
lumbia several weeks ago to take the
officers’ examination. He was uncertain
at the time of the outcome, and up till
November 26 he heard nothing about it.
On that date his appointment from the
War Department arrived and he donned
his officer's uniform.

Being uncertain about the appoint-
ment, he had neither bars nor leather
puttees on hand. He was able to bor-
row Sergeant Ryan’s bars as he was an
officer during the war. The leather put-
tees perplexed him until he thought of
Major Rogers’ beautifully shined pair.
Major Rogers readily consented to loan
his for-the time being and the lieutenant
was able to appear in all his glory.

Lieutenant Johnson is well liked by all
who know him and his many friends in
college and in town rejoice with him in

this honor that he has gained. Promo-
tion usually comes to those who deserve
it, and none could deserve it more than
Lieutenant Johnson, both for his work in
the world war and his work here. .

B. W. ROMEFELT NAMED

(Continued from page 1)

their losing the last game of the year,
and spoke with confidence in the future
success of the Wildcats under the direc-
tion of Romefelt, who was unanimously
elected captain for the year 1921.

Among those responding to toasts
were Coach Grey, who expressed his
appreciation of the full work accomplish-

7

ed by this year’s squad and for the fine
spirit of all the men. Mac Richards
represented the second string men, who
deserve a great deal of credit for their
continuous hard work. Brady, who fin-
ishes his football career with this year’s
team, and Faison who is looking for-
ward to three more years with the
Davidson squad, made very fitting
speeches. Dr. Douglas ably represented
the faculty in a few well-chosen remarks.
Captain-elect Romefelt expressed his ap-
preciation of the honor shown him and
expressed his strong hopes for even a
more successful season for the ,Wild-
cats in 1921.
