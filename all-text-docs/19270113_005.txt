The conference, guided by these spléndid
leaders, voted in favor of supporting wars,
but not all wars, of denying no one any privi-
leges on the campus because of race or color,
and of working out a new standard of  in-
dustrial relationships. The conclusion reached
was that if the Way of the Cross is followed
faithfully and well, the great problems of the
age will be brought to a successful solution.

The conference at Milwaukee was the big-
gest of its kind ever held, and was regarded
by many as having an exceptionally fine spirit
of brotherhood present. The results of this
conference in the future will be watched with
interest.

“The fact is, that civili-
zation requires slaves.
The Greeks were quite
right there. Unless there
are slaves to do the ugly,
horrible, uninteresting
work, culture and con-
templation become almost
impossible. Human
slavery is wrong, inse-
cure, and demoralizing.
On mechanical slavery,
on the slavery of the
machine, the future of
the wor'd depends.”’

In a quarter-century the General Electric

a total of more than 350,000,000 man-power.
Eleciric light, heat, and transportation have also
contributed their part to the freeing of men. These
are America’s slaves. Through their service
American workers do more, earn more, and
