FRENCH CLUB GIVES
MOTION PICTURE IN
DAVIDSON THEATRE

Famous French Picture “La
Maternelle” Presented By
French Circle

“La Maternelle,” the most famous
French motion picture ever pro-
duced, will be presented in the Dav-
idson theater on Friday, February
26 in the afternoon. The picture
is sponsored by ole Cercle Fran-
cais.”

The title of the picture means
“Children of Montmartre,” and has
as its plot the loves and hates of
the poor children of Montmartre,
who are left to care for themselves
by their parents.

For the benefit, of those who do
not understand French easily the
spoken words are written in.English
on the margin of the film. The pic-
ture is a truly great work of art,
for it has been selected by critics
in this country and Europe as one
of the ten best motion pictures of
1936,

The heroes of this picture are un-
named urchins that were taken off
the streets of Paris. They are quite
at home in the setting of the pic-
ture, and because of this they give
an excellent portrayal of the true
life of children in the slums of a
French city.

A motion picture. such as this one
is presented every year by “Le
Cercle Francais” in an effort to give

a better understanding of the
French language to the students
here.

It is believed, however that this
year the picture will be of interest
to students who do not even take
French, because of the realism and
universal appeal of-this film.

This picture was produced by M.
Jean Benoit-Levy, after many
months of hard work. M. Benoit-
Levy is the head of the French
committee on educational pictures
at the League of Nations. He has
recently ‘been in this country at-

The University of Heidelberg is
again offering to the students of
Davidson College one free scholar-

letter from the German university
states that it has become apparent

Field Horine, now a student at
Davidson, spent his junior year at

‘Y’ Works Collecting
Christmas Gift Fund

Collections on the “Y” Christmas
gift fund for $800 are going for-
ward at a slower rate than expect-
ed, but with a good response from
all approached.

Monday, February 15, was the
tentative date for complete collec-
tion of the fund, but as only half
of the fund had been collected by
last Saturday, collections were ex-
pected to run into this week.

As all boys aproached so far have
paid, hopes for collection of the en-
tire sum are high. If all the money
pledged is collected, it will certainly
be one of the largest gift funds ever
coliected here and perhaps will be
the highest on record.

The money, when collected, will
be used to’construct a much needed
light plant for Mutoto, Africa, deep
in the Belgian Congo.

Smith Speaks Before

Alumni Council Meet

Mr. Fred Smith, Alumni Secre-
tary, attended a meeting of section
three of the American Alumni
Council in Greensboro, N. C., on
Friday, February 12th. There were
about forty alumni and alumnae
secretaries at this meeting repre-
senting colleges and universities in
five southern states.

The purpose of this council is to
discuss and consider the problems
which arise in this phase of college
administration. Mr. Smith was ask-
ed to make a speech before the
group and to give his views con-
cerning some parts of work in
which the entire group was affili-
ated.
