Scott To Keep AD Post One More Year

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE
Sports Editor

Director of Athletics Tom
Scott will not retire at the close
of this school year according to
Davidson College officials.

Although the college has a
Stipulation requiring the
retirement for its employees at
age 65, Scott, who turned 65
during the present academic
year, has been asked to remain
on the staff for one more year.

The college cited the need for
a transitional period in the

director's position and Scott's
important commitments with
the National Collegiate
Athletic Association and the
Southern Conference as reasons
for the suspension of college
regulations in this case.

“Filling Dr. Scott's position
will be difficult,"’ commented
College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. ‘‘Tom is one of the
best-known, best-liked figures
in college athletics. He is a real
gentleman who always stood for
high standards in the sports
world.”’

Scott and the Christmas Shirt

The announcement of Tom Scott’s retirement, ef-
fective at the end of the 1973-74 academic year, brings
to mind some old news stories that I saw while rum-
maging through the News Bureau’s file on Scott.

Take for example a story from the Charlotte News
on Dec. 18, 1959.

The article was by Scott, entitled, ‘‘His Basketball
Foes Saw Red;’. It told of Scott’s 1938 Christmas at the
time Scott was a coach at Central Missouri State
College. The team was called the Mules. What a
name!!!

On Christmas Day the team piled into cars and
headed for Oklahoma City, where they were in a big
Christmas tourney. They were not in the best of
spirits, however, since they had an 0-4 record at the
time.

Anyhow, Scott went on to say that he opened one of
his presents when the team arrived. It was a red sports
shirt. He decided to wear it in their game against
New Mexico University on the 26th.

Well, those Mules upset a bigger and stronger team
from a much larger school. One the following two
days the same CMSC club copped wins over some
Texas team (Scott couldn’t remember which one) and
a Pittsburg, Kansas squad, which had dealt them two
of their previous four defeats. Defying all the odds,
the team went on to defeat Hank Iba’s Aggies from
Oklahoma A&M. By the way, Scott still had on that
red shirt.

I am sure that you guessed the end of the story and
you are right. Five wins and a smelly shirt later,
Scott’s Mules were tournament champions.

Scott concluded, “I wonder what ever happened to
my red sports shirt.”

By the way, I heard Terry Holland was last seen
heading for the North Pole to....

Notes On The Athletic Crisis

With the completion of the Crisis in Athletics series,
I have moved from a stand for the abolition of sub-
sidized football to the ‘‘rightist”’ view of keeping the
pigskin sport.

I think that, until we are absolutely certain that a
nonsubsidized program will save us a substantial
amount of greenbacks, we should not made any hasty
judgments on the fate of the gridiron program.

For the time being, we ought to be content to stay in
the Southern Conference until we can decide exactly
what should be done.

As far as basketball goes, I am in favor of letting
Terry Holland take his cagers and go auxiliary. Their
chances of winning would be increased and they
would bring in more money.

To me, that’s a pretty unbeatable combination.

Meanwhile, someone ought to start a poll to see

what the general reaction to these ideas (and others) -

would be. But, the poll should not just include stu-
dents. It should also get the opinions of people who
PAY tosee Davidson sports.

Scott's career as a coach
began with a high school and en-
ded with Davidson. He also
coached AAU basketball. His
college and AAU record is 335
wins and 163 losses.

Spanning a 42 year period, his
career in amateur athletics in-

cluded stops at Concordia

College in Mirinesota, Central
Missouri ‘State College, the
University of North Carolina,
the Phillips '66ers and David-

Scott took the Davidson post
as athletic director in 1955 with
the basic idea of ending his
coaching career. But the sud-
den resignation of Wildcat head
coach Danny Miller in the mid-
dle of the 1955-56 season promp-
ted the college to offer the job to
Scott. He took it and remained
at the helm until 1960.

Some of Scott's major ac-
complishments while at David-
son have been the development
of the Charlotte Invitational
Tournament, which Davidson
hosts, and the bringing of the
Eastern Regionals and the
Southern Conference Tour-
nament to the Charlotte
Coliseum.

He has been a valuable asset
to the South in putting national
emphasis on basketball here.

Recently he has served as
chairman of the NCAA’s
basketball committee, ‘which
oversees the operation of the
national basketball tour-
nament.

Scott attended college at Pit-
tsburg State Teachers College,
where he was named all-state in
Kansas and played for three un-
defeated teams from 1926 until
1930.

The native of Franklin, Kan-
sas began his career as a coach
and administrator at Moun-

before he assumed his first:

He received his masters

degree from the University of.

Scott has also served David-
son in the role of golf coach. He
took this position in 1955 and has
led his teams to five Southern
Conference championships.

During Scott's administration
here, the school has made

several important movements
in the athletic arena.

Football was made a

this about. Basketball shot into

for water sports.
