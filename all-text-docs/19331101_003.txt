The society's program for this week
consisted of talks by Jack Williams,
Joe Dees, and Bill Benfield. Williams
gave a humorous reading, “ Wild Oats,”

punishment when a college mate of
reminded him of his own
college pranks. The dean excused the
boy, but counseled, “If you .ever be-

society is

the dean

come dean,
Oats’ for it.”

Joe Dees gave an interesting survey
of the “Hoover Hotels” under Mich-
igan Avenue in Chicago. He pointed
out that in these hovels, America’s
worst evils are being generated, name-
ly, Hitlerism and violen¢e. He also
brought out that President Roosevelt

In the humorous strain again, Bill
Benfield brought down the house with
a fable of a modern Don Quixote.

The Yowl was somewhat of a new
idea this year, in that in the October
issue there are some articles of a more
literary nature, Stuart Henry having
charge of this phase of work. Wills
Hollingsworth has charge of! the
Poetry Department.

An article by Pratt-Thomas on Pro-
hibition was widely read and discussed
by students of the school, the attitude
of the article being against prohibi-
tion.

The jokes, as the nucleus of the
Yowl, were up to their usual standard
in this issue, consisting both of orig-
inal and exchanged humor.

An innovation in this year’s Yowl is
the column, Campus Chatter, edited by
Caskie Norvell, Jr., one of the manag-
ing editors.
