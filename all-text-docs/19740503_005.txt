Juni unior High School Essayist
’ Ponders ‘Marriage And Me’

The Women’s Liberation
Movement (or ‘‘Women’s
Lubrication Movement’’ as
Archie Bunker petulantly
refers to it) has in essence
ceased to ‘‘move.”’ However,
the results of the initial
demonstrations and the con-
tinuing repercussions from
these are bountiful and
gratifying. (Here! Here!
Here, for co-education at
Davidson C.!)

With three weeks to go
(HOORAY!!), it seems ap-
propos to reminisce and give
thanks for the progress we
have made. About nine years
ago, I knew a little girl in
junior high who was an avid
writer, and even had passing
fancies about reaching the

Gregory’s B-52 Herds Send
Americans To Seek Shelter

Dick Gregory spoke on
Tuesday’ night, and here it is
Thursday and I’m reall
fused. Yes, I must that
what Mr. Gregory said had a
lot of punch to it, but how
much of it will ever be felt.

I spoke with Mr. Gregory af-
ter his presentation in Love. I
asked him whether we, the
younger generation, had the
time necessary to fix what is
wrong with America. He
calmly told me that we have
either let ‘the point of no
return” pass us by, or that
“the point of no return” is
coming upon us like a herd of
B-52’s.

There’s no stopping the
bombs--we can't control
gravity--but we can be
prepared to seek shelter, and
then come out to rebuild the
Dresden-like America that
will face us. Of course all of
the metaphoric language is di-

rected towards the ‘moral
”’ and the “natural

con-' death’’ of our country.

Mr. didn’t have to
tell us that the United States is
in trouble. No cop questions
whether you’ve been drinking
when you come out of the car
smelling like a Listerine fac-
tory! Theings aren’t coming
up roses; you may smell
them but I know you don’t see
them jessies.

What Mr. Gregory told me
about the CIA’s supposed in-
volvement in both Kennedy
assassinations and the Hearst
kidnaping makes my leg
warm, at no fault of my own.

If Mr. Gregory is all wet,
I’m sure some agency will put
him in his place. But what if
Mr. Gregory is the ‘“‘apocalyp-
tic messenger’’ America has
been in need of for a long
time? What if all his ‘‘facts”’
‘were and will be proven true?

Where does that place us? ;

heights of literary acclaim.
Even at that early age, she
was concerned with women
and their place in society : two
of her essays strike me in par-
ticular right now.

First, she wrote an essay en-
titled ‘‘Marriage for Me.”’ ‘‘I
have given a good deal of
thought to that holy union
known as marriage, as I am
sure most girls have...I have
not decided that the one and
only should be any certain
type. In fact, I have not
decided that there will be a
one and only...

‘‘I have decided that one big
definite advantage in getting
married is that one does not
have to live by one’s self. Of
course, there are ways of not
having to live by one’s self...

“It is my belief that it is far
better to stay single than to
marry the wrong person for
the wrong reasons and then
regret it. Some people marry
to get away from home or for
money or for other selfish
reasons. Some people are so in
love, especially girls, with the
idea of marriage that they
marry for the sake of
marriage itself.

.“Singleness seems to be
condemned or treated as a
sign of misfortune. It is worse
for women than men. They are
tagged old maids while men
are called bachelors. Sup-
posedly, it is dashing and
suave to be a bachelor, but

blackest wrong to be an old
maid. I resent this strongly...I
may never marry...”

In ‘‘Green-eyed Me” written
a short time after ‘‘Marriage
for Me,’’ she examines her en-
vy of men. “‘I...am jealous of
boys for many reasons...One
of my fondest wishes has
always been to be able to wear
slacks to school. There are ob-
vious advantages. While I
have to sit in a manner that is
considered lady-iike, boys can
sprawl out in any direction
they wish.

‘Boys have no real
problems with their hair. My
hair is not one of my assets.
Boys don't have to roll their
hair every night. Futilely I at-
tempt almost every night to
roll my hair in some way so it
will look attractive, but to
what avail? It is just lucky
girls can’t see themselves.

“The basic thing that boys
have that I envy most is their
independence and
freedom...No matter how
much I say, this is a man’s
world...Boys do have obvious
advantages over girls, but
girls do have some ad-
vantages over boys. I’m glad
I'm a girl. After all, what
would boys do without girls?”

With graduation and life and
more liberation and con-
finement coming up in the new
future, at least that’s one
rhetorical question we won't
have to ponder too heavily.

Miller Claims ARA Exemptions

From Minimum Wage Increases

To the Editor:

I have reason to believe that
Mr. Corser (THE DAVID-
SONIAN, April 26) is sadly
mistaken in assuming that
ARA Slater will be effected
directly by the minimum
wage hike signed into law by
President Nixon. My reason
for this is that ARA Slater is 4
food service and is exempt
from the minimum wage law
in the first place.

Technically any employee
of a food service can receive
tips (and many do, though
they don’t work for Slater),
therefore, these workers are
exempt from the law.

From I know
that this is true; many people
working for food outlets such
as hamburger joints and
restaurants don’t make even
near the minimum wage.

My first job with a grease

joint started at $1.05 per hour
and when I quit I was

receiving only $1.35 per hour.
A friend of mine made only 90¢
per hour working for a motel
restaurant.

A camp I worked at only
paid its kitchen personnel $25
per week for about 30 hours
work. All of the above exam-
pies were taken from the past
year anda half.

So, you see, ARA Slater isn’t
required to raise its minimum
wage. Their work force would
probably be depleted a little if
they didn’t raise it.

(Ed. note: Although we ap-

preciate the information ap-

in Mr. Miller’s letter,
the editors of THE DAVID-
SONIAN feel a_ respon-
sibility to reiterate that the
amendment to the minimum
wage law will directly affect
the ARA dining service on
campus. Currently, the star-
ting rate for full-timeunskilled

help 1s' $1.65 ‘an hour at the :

ARA facilities. By May 1 this
rate will have to be increased
to $1.90 an hour. Please note
the emphasis on full-time sin-
ce the new minimum wage
law doesn't apply to part-time
employees. We can only

assume that the experiences
he mentioned were part-time
situations.)

Herb Jackson At The Mint Museum
A selection of new prints and small paintings by Herb Jackson
is being featured at Gallery 501 in Charlotte until May 9. Jackson
is a nationally known artist of exceptional talent. His work has
been included in the collections of the Smithsonian Institution in
Washington, the Art Institute in Chicago, and the Ringling
Museum in Sarasota, Fla. as well as the Mint Museum in Char-

loft. uthographs being shown are reminiscent of Jackson's
earlier cloud series as well as a suite of etchings depicting the
four elements - earth, sky, air and water - which reflect the ar-
tist ’s continuing interest with atmosphere, with what is real and
not real. The Gallery is located at 501'Hémestedd Place:

writers have a habit of depic-
ting buildings and places with
little feeling for the people who
built and inhabited them.

Morris, however, sets out to
portray both the city of
Washington and the people
who flow through it.

At a party - and the book
must refer to a hundred of
them - Carol quips, ‘‘Nor-
therners have never written
about Washington because it’s
too Southern, and Southerners
think it too Northern.”

Not one of the double-name
belles of ‘‘Yazoo,’’ Carol has
all the talents necessary to
gain prominence in
Washington circles: brains,
caprice, irreverence, and
