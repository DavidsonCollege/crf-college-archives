it isn’t so, ur_relations seem to
be a bit wfrained in regard to the
negro at this time, but that isn't

right thing to do is to try to under

The project this year is perhaps
much more timely. Our treatment of

the negroes in the past has been
both un-Democratic and® un-Chris-

is expedient as well that we try to

sound inanner. Davidson can do a

in the solving of this problem by en-
