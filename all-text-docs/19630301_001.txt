Sailstad Maintains Vags
Will Maintain Program

BY DAVID STITT
Davidsonian Managing Editor

Davidson’s drama program apparently will continue

spite the resignation of Vagabond

student assistants last week.

This was the essense of a
statement made by Robert J.
Sailstad, chairman of the Vaga-
bond Governing and Planning
Board, after a board meeting
last Friday.

Wednesday afternoon’ the
drama department released the
names of three new student co-
ordinators, who will be largely
responsible for the continuance
of the program. They are Jon
Miller, Chum Roberts, and Bob
Chumbley. It was also announc-
ed that James R. Gross and Dr.
W. H. Tilley will supervise the
upeoming student plays.

Although Sailstad did not
cite any specific steps his
committee has taken toward
toward securing a director or
resolving other key Vagabond
problems, he said that the
committee plans to go ahead
with the student productions,
and then decide at a later

indication is that the college
will do everything it can to
encourage students and facul-
ty in a drama program—a
good drama program—adapt-
ed to the needs and oppor-
tunities in a liberal arts col-

lege.

“Our committee has discussed
ways of promoting interest in
the theater, but basically we are
concerned with keeping the
theater active for this semester.
There is interest, there is a
good record of achievement, and
we are mainly interested in
capitalizing on this interest,” he
concluded.

President D. Grier Martin,
when asked about why the
secretarial help promised

as planned this spring, de-

director Dr. William F. Goodykoontz and two

Goodykoontz never materializ-
ed, noted that the business of-
fice had been trying to find
a secretary for the Vagabonds,
but that several personnel in
that office had been out with
the flu, and thus had been un-
able to conduct interviews for
the job.

Martin expressed appreciation
to Goodykoontz for his one-man
effort to keep the drama pro-
gram alive and effective. He
pointed out that Goodykoontz
would “.. . . hardly have been
fair to himself’’ to have continu-
ed carrying the tremendous load
he was under prior to his resig-
nation as Vagabond director.

“He was driving himself be-
yond the point any man ought
to be driven,” Martin stated.

“We've done about all we can
for now,” Carrell said after the
Student Council meeting Mon-
day night.

(The Student Council had
hoped to persuade the faculty
this year to abolish the rule
which prohibits drinking at an
off-campus event sponsored in
some way by the college.)

“We can't even get by the
committee, so there's no use
in pushing the matter any fur-
ther this year. Maybe next
year a little more can be
done, and we'll eventually get
this rule abolished—but not
while I'm here,” he stated.

Carrell was careful to point
out that, although he had hoped

thing accomplished, and that's
better than nothing.”

In a DAVIDSONIAN interview

several major problems the
Vagabonds have had in attempt-

reluctance on the part of the
administration to whole-heart-

On Debating Team Future

Davidson debate coach Dr. J. T. Drake expressed

his fears Wednesday that it

ht be necessary to cancel

Davidson’s participation in still another debating tourna-

ment this year.

Drake moaned, “It’s very dis-
couraging. Last year we never
had to cancel a tournament.
This year it seems that we've
done nothing but cancel.”

Last year was a particularly
good year for Davidson's debat-
ing team. Both the novice team
and the varsity won about 75
percent of their rounds, bring-
ing back many first and second
place trophies.

This year, however, Drake has
noticed a definite drop in stud-
ent interest. Many of the mem-

Congress May Vote

On ROTC

Alteratons

Certain changes are likely to take place in the ROTC
program at Davidson, pending the outcome of legislation

now before Congress.

An article in the Feb. 9 Army
Times reported that Officers
Education Program (OEP) is
being geared to attract promis-
ing college students into the
Army and Air Force for at least
four years of active duty. Par-
ticipants would receive schol-
arships totaling $1100 annually
for two years.

Defense Secretary Robert Mc-
Namara, in testimony before the
House Armed Services Commit-
tee, said OEP is one of several
changes being proposed in the
ROTC programs of the Army
and Air Force.

ROTC cadets from $27 to a
much higher figure.

As a condition of scholarship,
OEP participants must agree to
accept a Regular commission if
tendered and serve four years
on active duty.

Monthly compensation for
students in the regular ROTC
would be less than that pro-
vided OEP participants, but
their active duty obligation
will be less, too. ROTC grad-
vates are currently required
to spend from six months to
two years on active duty.

The two-year ROTC course
would provide a total of 12 to
14 semester hours of on-campus
instruction and would permit up
to 12 weeks of summer train-
ing.”

Of 243 sophomore students at
Davidson currently enrolled as
MS I's, 182 have applied for the
advanced program. The final
number accepted into the pro-
gram will be known as soon as

are com-

bers of last year’s team have

Many of these cases “are prob-
ably due to an overload of work.
They will probably be remedied
as soon as these people can get
their schedule straightened out.
At least from the upper class-
men I've seen some work.”

The main problem seems to
stem from the freshmen. The
beginning of the year show-
ed an exceptional amount of
interest among the freshmen
when 17 expressed their de-
sire to work with the team.
This group has dwindled to
four.

would be another two or three
weeks before student parking
is allowed behind the Fine Arts
Center. He said that signs have
now been ordered and will be
put up soon.

Fred McGuirt suggested that
student parking be permitted
around the gym at night. in
places reserved for the athletic
department staff. “They (the
parking places) aren’t used after
five o’clock, so why can't they
be handled like the ROTC area
beside Belk?” he asked.

This would allow more park-

ing area for students using
the gym at night. The coun-

cil has sent the request to the
faculty Traffic Committee.

Another change in the Stud-
ent Council By-Laws was approv-
ed. The election of the President
of the Student Union will be
open to the student body in the
future. Nominations will be
made by the Union board, but

Drake believes that several |
factors contribute to this lack of |
interest. He stated that the cur-
riculum has grown harder for
freshmen, limiting the time they
can spend on extra-curricular
activities,

Another cause, he feels, is
Davidson's lack of a profes-
sional coach. “It’s discourag-
ing to these students to find
that we can’t give them the
professional assistance they
expect and to which many of
them were accustomed in high
school.
