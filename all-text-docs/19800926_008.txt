By BUCK BRADBERRY

The 1980 Davidson cross-
country team, under coach
Sterling Martin, worked out
with optimism this week despite
a dissappointing 15-49 loss to a

strong Duke team over the -

weekend.

Randy McManus and“John
Davis finished one and two
among the Wildcats and took
7th and 10th places in the meet,
which was run Saturday morn-
ing on Davidson's tough home
course.

Finishing third among his
teammates and 13th overall,
promising freshman Frank Ivie
sauntered past the finish line a
mere four seconds ahead of
Davidson's 4th man, senior
' The women runners, anchor-
ed by Alabaman Tamara
Foreman and sophomore Mar-
ian Hill, under-pointed Duke's
“club” cross-country women in
a 23-36 win. With Carrie Ninn,

Merris Hollingsworth, and Jane
Thompson also showing well,
the team raised its record to 1-2.
The Cats can surpass the .500
mark this Saturday as the
women take on Georgia St. and
Wake Forest in Charlotte.

The men’s team, now 2-1,

Rees and Jeff Morrow, who
took respective 16th, 17th, and
19th places against Duke, are
upperclassmen whose times will

the rest of the resolute gang,
provide Coach Martin with
ample assurance of a worthy
showing on Saturday.

Atkinson and Piercy
experience 2 kinds of pain

By JIM CROWE
Sports Editor

Instead of worrying about
getting first downs or setting
new school records, two out-
standing Davidson offensive
performers would be happy just
to get back in uniform.

Injured stars Alvin Atkinson
and Gifford Piercy say their
main objectives now are to
maintain physical conditioning
and to bolster team morale.

Atkinson, an All-American
candidate at halfback, injured
his knee on September 13
during the game against
Springfield. He underwent ar-
throscope surgery on Septem-
ber 16, to remove a torn carti-

lage. Doctors at Richmond

Community Hospital alse found
that Atkinson sustained dam-
age to ligaments and the knee
capsule.

Head Athletic Trainer Tom
Couch said, ‘‘Alvin’s surgery
went real well. Now, we (the

“training staff) will help him

keep in shape, but it will really
be up to him to decide when he
is ready to go back in the field.”

Piercy, wide receiver for the
Wildcats, sprained his foot
during a pileup in the Lafayette
game last Saturday. He is
undergoing ice treatments and
elevation of his foot to reduce
the swelling of the bruises.

Both players said that they
are working hard to overcome
their injuries in order to play
against Bucknell. However,
both described the complica-
tions of sitting out to be harder
to overcome than the physical.
injuries.

Atkinson said, ‘‘This is my
first injury, so it is really
strange. I haven’t been able to
seetle into a daily routine. It
(the injury) has thrown every-
thing off track, including every-
thing that doesn’t have any-
thing to do with football.’’

Piercy said, ‘‘There are two
kinds’ of pain that come with
sitting out, the physical kind
and the kind that comes from
feeling useless.”

Both players say they will
continue to be very involved in
the affairs of the team off the

‘field.

Atkinson said, “I'm still a
part of the team, even while I’m
injured. I can still contribute a
lot even though I’m not on the
field."’ Piercy stated, ‘‘I’ll still
work on team morale and be a
cheerleader, even from the side-
lines.”

Trainer Tom Couch took the
injuries in stride, saying,
‘Football is a rough game.
That’s why it takes so many
guys to play it.”
