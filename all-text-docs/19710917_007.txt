Gridders To Face
Improved Keydets

By JOE EARLE
Sports Editor

Football coaches are some-
umes hard to comprehend.

One would expect Dave Fagg
to be optimistic about tomor-
row's VMI game.

VMI has been consistently
Tated at the bottom of the
Southern Conference. Last year
they posted @ 1-10 season, and
no advances were expected.

But Fagg can only think of
the improvements that VMI has
made in the past vear.

The Keydets have added a
new coach in the person of Bob
Thalman.

Thalman is a graduate of
Richmond and has had various
football jobs all over the South.
Fagg calls him one of the finest
men in football.

Thalman also has something
to work with. VMI is basically
a running team. and this year
they have two fair backs in

running back Mac Bowman and
fallback Mike Teubner.
year Bowman racked up
350 vards rushing and Teubner

nit 228.

Fagg is also to quick to point
out the advantages the Keydets
s.1] have going into the game

“They are essentially an un-
known.” he said. “‘because it’s

their first game. and they have
a new coach.”
Another advantage the Key-

dets will have in weight.

“They outweigh us in every
line position,’ Fagg said. But
so did Wake Forest, and David-
son played the Deacons a fair-
ly even game defensively.

Maybe Fagg could have some-
thing to worry about. In their
first game on their home field.
the Keydets may have some ad-
vantage.

offense is better
than ever, we can move the
ball,’ Fagg says. And tomor-
row night they should. He’s con-
sidered all the possibilities.

Soccer Team Opens

has scheduled a scrimmage

This will be the first field
showing for the Davidson kick-
ers. a team coach Peter Sterl-
ing called an improvement over
last year’s Southern Conference
champions.

The Charlotte Club has a
team to be respected, accord-
ing to Dick Levan, captain of
the Davidson team.

“They are all amateur play-
ers.” he said. “but they have
a lot of experience and they
have already beaten Belmont-
Abbey. one of the toughest
teams around.”
