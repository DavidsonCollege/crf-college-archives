INTERESTING ‘FALKS BY
MRS. MOTTE MARIN.

Mrs. Motte Martin, one of the mis-
stonarics of the Southern) Presbyterian
Church, to the Congo, has been on the
Hill this week, visiting in the families
of Dr. Arbuckle and Mrs. Vinson. With
her is her little son and Bakumba, an
African girl.

While here she met Rev. Mr. Crane,
an alumnus of Davidson. He is just
back from the. Congo, and brought her
news from her husband, who is also a
missionary in Africa, and whom she has
not seen for two vears.

It is probable that Mrs. Martin will
sail at an carly date for Lisbon, Portu-
gal, where she will meet her husband,
who will be on a furlough. After rest-
ing there for a while, they will both re-
turn to Africa and resume their work.

On last Wednesday night Mrs. Mar-
tin and Mr. Crane spoke to the colored
people of the community in one of the
negro churches, on the customs, dress
and conditions in Africa. Bakumba
added to the interest by singing “Trust
and Obey” in African dialect..

On Friday afternoon’ Mrs. Martin
addressed the Student Volunteer Band
with a most interesting account of the
missions in Africa.

Mrs. Martin leaves Davidson today.

ANNUAL SENT TO PRESS.

The last of the material for the 1915
Annual was sent to the publishers: in
Atlanta, Ga.. todav, and the staff, after
much faithful work, and the entire stu-
dent body now await with keen antici-
pation the time when the publishers shall
have finished their task. Many and im-
portant changes will be made in the
Annual this year, but in order that the
interest in its appearance might not in
any way be diminished, the Editor-in-
Chief and Business Manager are careful
not to reveal even the nature of these
changes. The fact that a new publish-
ing house has the contract this vear is
evidence in itself of an Annual with
new features. The Annuals will reach
Davidson about the last of April.

REPRESENTATIVE OF
BIBLE SCHOOL HERE.

K. G. McComb, from White’s Bible
School, New York, delivered an address
before the Ministerial and Student Vol-
unteer Bands last Saturday afternoon.
He is a student body representative, and
during his vacation is making a tour of
Southern colleges. Mr. McComb had
a short talk after supper with members
of the band who were interested in his

work.

SPLENDID SERVICES.

(Continued from page 1)

He brought them a forceful and telling
call to the ‘ministry.

At the regular 1 o'clock services
which was the communion service, ¢igh
members were added to the church, six
hy profession of faith and two by certifi
cate.

‘The evening service was the crowning
service of the meeting. “Pine church wa:
well filled. After one of the most im
pressive sermons of the week, cards were
distributed throughout the congregation
and each was asked to state the help that
he or she had received from the services.
Many messages of gratitude and thanks
were written on these cards.

Dr. Graham left Monday morning to
return to Lexington, Va., where he is
pastor, but the messages that he has
brought to Davidson will live and effect
the lives of the people of the city for

many years. a

BASEBALL SCHEDULE.

(Continued from page 1)

had a good deal of ability. ‘This staff
should bid fair to equal the pitching trio
of last year, consisting of Osteen, Curric
and Anderson.

Captain’ Alford will do the brunt of
the receiving for the Red and Black
Machine this season. With his knowl
edge of the game, his hitting ability and
his deadly peg, he will be without doubt
the most valuable captain we have had
in years.

The. infield is rapidly getting into
shape and needs only a few more sun-
shiny davs to get in smooth working or-
der. Saunders, a) Freshman from
Hampden-Sidney, is the best bet for the
initial sack. He handles himself well,
ind is a fair hitter. Christenbury will
he seen at second base performing in his
usuitl stvle. His hitting and base run-
ning will be of great help to the team
as usual, Somerville will work at short
with his usual brilliancy. “This pair will
be a tower of strength to the infield as
they have had previous experience and
work together well. Black; of —Fish-
burne Military School, seems to be the
probable man for third base.

In the outfield Stough, Brown, Walk
er, Keesler, Hughes and McKinnon are
showing up well. Stongh played last
vear and was one of the hardest hitters
on the team. Brown made his letter
for the past two vears and led the team
in hitting last season. Walker plaved
in most of the games last season, and is
showing up well both in the field and at
the hat.

The first game of the season will be
plaved on the Hill against Elon on Fri-
dav of this week. It bids fair te be a
hotly contested game, since the Varsity
is fast getting into trim, and the nine
from Elon are.considered in the class of
anv other team in the State. Now with
a little backing by the student body the
team will fight its way to victory. So
let our motto for the entire season be
“Plenty Pep.”
