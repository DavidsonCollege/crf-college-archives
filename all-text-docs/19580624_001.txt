by - Ed Slanders

and be corrupted or remain true to my love?

possibly accept? POPULAR

ADVICE (continued)

Dear Mr. Slanders: Lately I have noticed

that my wife has been going through my bill-

fold and taking money without telling me.

This greatly annoys me, especially since she

has been bringing home large quantities of

lollypops. Should I call a halt to this?
ANNOYED

Dear Annoyed: Call a halt or develop an
overwhelming appetite for lollypops!

Dear Mr. Slanders: I don't know why, but
lately people have been calling me all sorts
of names, like dirty, stinky, and "Halitosis
Kid", I have begun to develop a complex.
Please tell me what to do.

COMPLEX

Dear Complex: Take a bath, use deodorant,
and brush your teeth}!
