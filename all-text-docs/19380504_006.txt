Chesterfield and Andre
Kostelanetz... they bring
more pleasure to millions

...real pleasure...carefree pleasure!
You enjoy it in Chesterfield’s refresh-
ing mildness and better taste... that
“extra something” that makes you
stick to Chesterfields.

Chesterfields are made of the world’s best
cigarette ingredients... mild ripe tobaccos...
home-grown and aromatic Turkish...and pure
cigarette paper. When you light a Chesterfield
you’re smoking the cigarette that-Satisfies.

hestertields

will give you MORE PLEASURE
than any cigarette you ever smoked
