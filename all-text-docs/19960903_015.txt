Volleyball wins two of three
in Davidson Invitational

By Drew WILLIAMS
Staff Writer

One might find the Davidson
volleyball bench players a bit odd-
they refuse to sit on the bench.

“They instituted that rule
themselves,” said head coach Lisa
Radford, “partly to stay warm, and
partly to stay upbeat and focused
on the game.”

The hustling, intense attitude
paid off this weekend, with two
decisive victories against Howard
and Charleston Southern.

The Wildcats lone setback was
a 3-0 loss to Southern Conference
rival Furman on Saturday after-
noon.

“You’ve got to give them
credit. They are an experienced
team and it was good to play them
and see what kind of competition
we are up against,” said Radford.

The Paladins won, 15-11, 15-
2, and 15-10. Their blocking duo
of Kristin Klessing and Amy Dakes
held the Wildcats at bay for most
of the match.

The games against Howard
and Charleston Southern were a
different story.

“I’m very pleased with the
way we played, everyone got a lot
of playing time, and those first
game jitters are out of the way,”
said Radford after her team walked
away with a 15-1, 15-7, 15-6 vic-

tory over Howard on Friday night. -

Lois Ann Bumgarner led the
Wildcats with 10 kills, while Audra
Bogdanski (11 digs) and Leslie
Carbone (3 blocks) provided plenty
of defensive support. ;

They capped a successful tour-
nament by beating CSU,15-5, 16-

Freshman Audra Bogdanski played
a major role in the victory, record-
ing numerous digs and a kill to
clinch the come-from-behind sec-
ond game victory.

“I’m very excited about this
year’s team,” said Bogdanski, a

‘Milwaukee native and Wisconsin

All-State volleyball player. “I think
we have a lot of potential.”

The Wildcats travel to the
Memphis University Tournament
next weekend, which includes
Mississippi, Middle Tennessee
State, Memphis, and Southwest-
ern Louisiana.

But before leaving, Radford
hopes to improve on the team’s
blocking and overall team disci-
pline.

Seventh straight Deep South title
set firmly in field hockey’s sights

By Caro REYNOLDS
Staff Writer

Having won six straight Deep
South Field Hockey Champion-
ships, the Davidson field hockey
team is back, and prepared to cap-
ture a seventh.

“Our attitude is so very posi-
tive,” said junior Erin Smith. “This
is one of the best teams I’ ve seen.”

But this fall’s schedule in-
cludes only four of eighteen games
at home. They will open the sea-
son against Westchester Univer-
sity (Pa.) on Sept. 7. The Wildcats
open at home on Oct. 1 against
Radford, a match-up head coach
Betsy Pryor is hungry to win. Her
team has never beaten Radford,
though it has tied and lost in over-
time. She thinks this year’s team
has the talent to do it.

“I am so excited about this
team,” said Pryor. “They have
already gelled. They’re so tight.”

She believes the amount of
road trips could actually help,

though she has some qualified con-
cerns.

“There is always major bond-
ing on the bus rides,” she said.
“But, turf field hockey is a faster
game and on a poor quality grass
field, the home team can be accus-
tomed to the irregularities. and
unique characteristics (of the
field).”

“Road trips can kill you or
save you,” said captain Mary
Dowd. “I’m sure it’s going to go
really well for us.”

And according to Pryor, the
strongest attribute of the team is its
unity. For this reason she will keep
the roster at 18 or 19 players.

“It’s asmaller team than usual,
but I’ve found it’s better for the
attitude and tightness of the play-
ers,” she said.

She added that another team
strength is the physical defensive
line, including freshman back Kim

Ceci, a very steady player with

good fundamental skills.
Filling a void left from last

year’s seniors, Kate Schoening is
also expected to make a contribu-
tion at left mid-field and is having
no problem fulfilling her impor-
tant offensive role. Lisa Holthaus,
another rookie with good work
ethic, will probably be playing cen-
ter forward.

The combination of new tal-
ent and the experience of strong
veteran players makes captains
Mandy Neidert and Dowd very
optimistic and coach Pryor eager
to play arch-rival Appalachian
State.

“App. State lives, eats,
breathes, and dreams to beat us,”
Pryor stated. “They get better and
better each year, and this year we
have to go up there to play on their
turf.”

Even beating ACC opponents
Wake Forest and Virginia and Big
10 giant Ohio State is not out of the
question. “We need to beat Ohio
State to prove that last year’s loss

‘was a fluke,” said Pryor with a

grin. “We are going to have fun.”

Cross country looks
for big improvements

By Ros Pore AND WILL BRADSHAW
Staff Writer and Sports Editor

The men’s cross country team, thanks to a solid recruiting class,
is about to make a name for itself.

“This is the best recruiting class ever,” coach Gary Andrew
stated.This team could be the best ever.”

Last year the team placed ninth out of ten in conference, this year
they are hoping to place at least fifth in their division.

Will Isenhour, one of ten freshman recruits, was a four time MVP
in high school.

“It’s great to be on a team where everybody is pushing each other
to do better,” Isenhour said. “There is a lot of prospect in the future.”

“We don’t have to rely on the freshmen,” comments captain
David Foss, “but they are definitely a good addition.”

* Returning upperclassmen, such as MVP Josh Cookson, Foss,
Tripp Franklin, Jonathan Fly, and Keith Gordon, are helping lead
them to a successful year.

A new sophomore recruit from Washington University, Rick
Cratsenberg, recently recovered from major knee surgery, but is
expected to make an immediate impact.

“He was a very talented runner in high school,” Andrew said
about Cratsenberg. “He could challenge Cookson for the number one
spot this fall.”

The team’s first and only home meet is October 5.
