10—The Davidsonian—March 13, 1981

In Veritate Magna Vis

In an unprecedented move last week, Athletic Director Gene
Bingham fired all Davidson coaches and staff (including
himself) as part of his massive revitalization plan. President
I.M. Oblivious has appointed nice guy Charlie Slagel to coach
all Davidson. Sports and take on duties as Athletic Director.
When reached for comment on his new position Slagel said, ‘‘I
may be slow, but I’m a fast learner.” Slagel’s secretary will be
Noni Mathews.

The Brick

Among those fired was Head Football
Coach Yahweh Farrell. One of his
Bros and players, Gifford Piercy, commented
“I’m glad he’s gone, he really hurt my
Doughboys chances to go pro, talking me down to

pro scouts and everything.’’ Mike Dillon

added, ‘‘If he hadn’t left, Davidson
Football would have been history.’’ When others were asked to
comment on the situation, Shawn Stafford blurted out, ‘‘He
wouldn’t play me enough, nor get me the ball so I could score. I
only averaged about twenty-seven minutes a game.’’ When
asked to respond Farrell said, ‘‘Shawn didn’t have a good
attitude, he didn’t have the team concept—he hated to play
defense.’ In fact the general concensus around the campus was

that all ninety-two players were going to transfer if Farrell
hadn’t been fired. —— ag

. . .In an effort to cut down on the large number of traffic
deaths occurring in front of the laundry, Physical Plant Director
Grover Meetze announced that the road will be cohverted into a
walkway. ‘Hopefully,’ he said, ‘this will further inconvenience
the students. We believe driving all the way around the Court
should be a real pain, in fact, by the time we're finished
remodeling the students will need Lewis and Clark and
Sakajaweja to find their ways around.

group of Banshee Indians, released their choices for the 81-82

column” Murrell has purchased an entire set of weights for the
school to use.

.. .Boy we really felt like dung after those girls wrote in their
letters last week. We called home and cried for hours. We've got
a suggestion—you all stick to breaking tables and we'll stick to
writing abusive, funny columns.

23 people collecting game
stickers, we thought our chan-
ces were pretty good. One coke
and an order of fries, however,
were all we won.

Tuesday's performance at
Disney World was the highlight
of the tour. Our audience in-
cluded an enthusiastic group of
Davidson students who picked
an ideal day to visit the home of
Space Mountain and Dumbo,
the Flying Elephant.

Wednesday, we started on
the last leg of the tour. After
stopping for. oranges to bring
back as evidence that we had

last concert.

Many different emotions and
events flavored the tour. The
nervousness before every per-
formance, the buoyant feeling
when a familiar face appeared in
the audience, the sadness of
bearing the nes of Donald
Plott’s death to the alumni who
knew him, the satisfaction of
performing well after the
months of practice, the fellow-
ship among the members. And
of course the realization tha we
were contributing to our college
and to the continuing growth of
the Women’s Chorus. |

If. Mickey and Minnie Mouse
appear among next year’s fresh-
men, you’ll know why.

The Women’s Chorus, Tour

And over it all is the noise.
Music pours from every wind-
ow, live, on the radio, or
recorded. Hundreds of people
carry radios and tape decks in
the street. Jazz and blues pour
out into the streets from bars
like Maise Bourbon (‘‘Dedicated
to the preservation of jazz’’)
and, in the evening, Preserva-
tion Hall. And on top of all
that, hundreds of thousands of
people packed into a few city
blocks are all shouting madly.

Thursday, March 5—We
have plenty of time between
Marianna and Tallahassee, so
we take a three-hour stopover at
Panama City Beach. The skies
are Clear, the sand is white, and
the water is—well, not ice-cold,
anyway. .

Friday morning, the long trip
home begins. The bus stops in
Atlanta to let off everyone who
lives in the area—half the bus,
it seems. The bus finally arrives
in Davidson at 7:30, after
eleven hours or so on the road.
Door to door, the trip is
almost exactly two thousand
miles long.

The Wind and Jazz Ensemble
tour concert will be Tuesday at
8:15 in Hodson Hall.
