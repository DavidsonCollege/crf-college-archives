Field hockey preps for tourney

By CarLo REYNOLDS
Staff Writer

“This is our first losing streak
in years. It’s also the youngest
squad we’ve had in years,” said
field hockey coach Betsy Pryor
after Sunday’s 1-0 loss to rival
App. St.

“It’s like (goalkeeper) Sarah
Gebhardt said. We’re right on the
edge of the fence. We’ve got to
decide whether we’re going to go
ahead and jump on over or not.”

With the Deep South Tourna-
ment a week away, Pryor and side-
lined captains Mary Dowd and
Mandy Neidert are doing their best
to urge the team out of its slump.

Neidert is battling a stress-
fracture in her leg, but has recently
been granted limited playing time
as her injury heals.

On Sunday she battled with
her younger teammates against
App. St. for about five minutes.

“The lack of playing time
makes it hard for her (to come
back),” said Pryor.

Mary Dowd, who is awaiting
knee surgery, paces the sidelines,
unable to play at all.

“It’s aquestion of composure,”
Pryor added. “We’re working on
the team’s poise. That’s where the
lack of senior leadership on the
field really comes in.”

“We were not playing posses-
sion,” said Pryor, giving an ex-
ample of .what happened in the
App. St. game when the team be-
gan losing composure.

“We can not just try to knock

the ball down. Finesse has always
been our type of game, but we get
frazzled, and we don’t play pos-
session.” :

After App. St. scored the only
goal of the game, Pryor called a
time out and cooled the team down.

“Seventy percent of the time
we played well. The rest of the
time we did not hold the ball,” she
said.

“You have to receive and pass,
receive and pass. We just hit it
down, arid App. St. can pick those
balls up. We have to have better
passes.”

At the Deep South Tourna-
ment this coming weekend, the

Wildcats meet Catawba and App.
St. in a round-robin.

“Payback!” Pryor said about
playing App. St. again.

“‘We’ll work on fundamentals
and shooting,” she said of her plans
to prepare for the rematch and the
tournament.

“A lot of times, when a team is
losing, every little detail becomes
an issue,” she continued.

“Thatis nottrue with this team.
They have held it together. They
are supportive to one another on
and off the field. Because of their
attitude, they really deserve to be
victorious, There are not a whole
lotofteams you can say that about.”

out earlier in the season.

Sunday’s 1-0 loss to App. St. set up a tie-breaker for the field
hockey teams at the Deep South Tournament this coming weekend.
Inthe other meeting with the Mountaineers this season, Davidson
won, 1-0. The Wildcats will have to find their winning ways again
if they want to retain the Deep South title for the seventh straight

“We played with heart,” said Erin Smith, who in the final
seconds of the game, stole the ball from the defense for a fast break
scoring attempt which was barely stopped.

On Tuesday, the Wildcats fell to Longwood, 4-0, and on °
Thursday they lost to Radford by the same count.

Longwood capitalized on a few well-executed plays to over-
come the ailing Wildcats, who have now lost four Dares after
beating Virginia Commonwealth.

Radford came to Davidson to make up. a.game that was rained

“We went to the ball more (than against Longwood), ” said
Smith. “But we couldn’t get it in the net.”

Volleyball spikes GSU and UNCA, but
drops tough match against Furman

By Drew WILLIAMS

Davidson won two of three
matches this week, defeating UNC
Asheville on Wednesday and Geor-
gia Southern on Friday before fall-
ing to Furman yesterday.

The five-game nail-biter
against UNCA ended in a 15-9,

10-15, 12-15, 16-14, 17-15 Wild-
cat victory.

L.A. Bumgarner’ s20kills and
Janet Duncan’ 6 blocks paced the
Wildcats to their eighth win of the
season.

To kickoff Parents' Weekend,
Davidson swept Georgia Southern
in three straight games.

Duncan again played an in-

strumental role in the victory, post-
ing 9 kills and 15 digs.

The Paladins ended the Wild-
cats' winning ways, notching a 17-
15, 15-0, 15-7 victory.

The Wildcats, now 9-16, look
to better their record next week
when they take on conference rival
App. St. on Friday.

Harriers run to conference

Staff Writer

The men’s cross country
team has had one of the best
seasons in coach Gary Andrew’s
11-year tenure, but their final two
meets should tell exactly where
the team ranks in school history.

The Wildcat harriers will first
race in the Southern Conference
Championships this Saturday at
Western Carolina in Cullowhee,
N.C. The team has high hopes for
the meet.

“We want to try to equal the
best in my 11 years here, seventh
out of ten,” said Andrew.

A seventh place finish would
be remarkable given that
Davidson is competing against
scholarship teams.

The top nine runners on the
squad will compete, led by star

junior Josh Cookson, who has put
together an excellent individual
season. Five of the other eight
runners competing are freshmen,
which bodes well for the future.

Although Cookson, Pat
Burchett, and Victor Talbird are
all nursing injuries, Andrew
thinks that they should be healthy
for the conference meet on Satur-
day.

After a successful regular
season, the team now has the
chance to prove how far they have
come.

“If they race up to their po-
tential, I would be willing to say
that they are my best,” Andrew
added.

The team’s final meet of the
year will be at the NCAA Region
IIIf Championships at Furman
University, the qualifying meet
for the NCAA Championships.

The forward line consistently
knocked the Deacons off the ball,
and set the physical tone for the

The back line handled the ball

The game was marred by
rough play, as Georgia Southern
out-fouled the Wildcats, 16-11.
Five cards were issued, including a
red card to Eagle Brian Oakes.

“They’ rea very physical team
and they really wanted this game,”
said Slagle. “A win over us would
have put them one win away from
a conference championship.”

The Wildcats (7-13, 3-3) fin-
ished with a home record of 6-2.

Davidson, which lost to cross-
country rival UNC Charlotte yes-
terday, 1-0, now has almost two
weeks to prepare for the Southern
Conference Tournament.

“This team has always had
heart,” said Kleeman. “But this
will give us an opportunity to get
on the same page.”
