Injuries Weaken J. V. Soccer Team

By David Dwyer

“From the first day we saw the
freshmen,” Davidson junior var-
sity soccer coach Peter Cobb says,
“we realized that they had a great
deal of talent. We expected a lot
from the start, and the team began
the season playing up to our expec-
tations. Unfortunately, we sud-
~ denly were hit by a rash of inju-
ries.” By the first of October, Cobb
found himself coaching only ten of
the twenty players originally listed
on his roster, having lost the other
ten to temporary injuries.

A plague of injuries can se-
verely damage a team’s hopes for
asuccessful year, particularly when
two-thirds of the team has never
played on the college level before.
The healthy players, however, have
taken it upon themselves to step up

when their teammates cannot per-
form. Among the team’s strengths
are its strong work ethic and the
impressive play of freshman goal-
keeper Howdie Coonley.

Cobb andassistantcoach Matt
Cox are trying to institute a game
plan that emphasizes short touches
on the ball and aggressive tack-
ling. As the season has progressed,
the coaches have seen a noticeable
change in these two aspects of the
team’s play, but continue to look
for further improvement.

Davidson began the season with
a3-1 victory over Brevard anda 1-
1 tie with the club team from UNC-
Chapel Hill, but things began to go
downhill from there. Davidson lost
its next three games, to Spartanburg
Methodist, Catawba, and UNC-
Charlotte, making their current

record 1-3-1. Played in a down-
pour, the victory over Brevarddem-
onstrated that determination and
hard work often prevail over skill
alone. A year ago, the J.V. team
finished the season at 8-2, but Cobb
was quick to point out that that
team faced a considerably easier
schedule and stayed relatively free
of injuries.

Despite the plague of injuries
afflicting the 1992 squad, Cobb
still expects good things from his
group. As the season progresses,
players will continue to recover
and, hopefully, will return to their
optimal playing level. Though
struggling atthis point, Davidson’s
J.V. soccer team should revert to
its winning ways and prove to be
extremely competitive throughout
the remainder of the season.

Rugby Stomps Western Carolina

By Dack Stackhouse

On September 26, the
Davidson Rugby Club played one
of its best games in recent history:
Taking on Western Carolina Uni-
versity in front of a large home
crowd, the Wildcats showed enor-
mous potential and began a streak
towards a possible Division I state
championship. Davidson played
hard as a team and won the game
34-17.

The scoring began early in the
first half when Scotch Tumer took
a penalty run into the try zone.
However, WCU wasted no time in
scoring a try of their own to tie the
game at seven apiece. Davidson
had trouble getting into the ‘try
zone for awhile, but Tim Dancy,
who did not miss a kick all day,
kept the team going with two pen-
alty kicks for three points each.
With the Wildcats leading 13-7,
WCU came back with another try

to go ahead 14-13. This proved to
bethe only time the Wildcats would
slip behind. As Scotch Turner said,
“We opened a can of serious
whoop-@#% on these guys.”
Davidson never looked back,
as Chris Reinking powered his way
toatry from five meters out. Shortly
thereafter, Edwin Thomas broke
away on the outside for a thirty
meter run to the try zone. Dancy

finished off the day’s scoring with |

a try of his own, making the game
against WCU probably the best
that he has ever played.

In a sport where team effort
makes the difference, it is difficult
to point out individuals who stand
out. However, Dancy’s kicking
must be mentioned because he did
notmiss all day, despite some sharp
angled conversions. Other
standouts on the day were Bob
Yarbrough, Matt Dormer and Tag
Kleiner, who ran and tackled as

hard as anyone. Other hard hitters
included David Rozelle and Rafael
Candelario, two of the most vi-
cious players in the state.

Ofcourse, congratulations are
due to all who scored-a try, but
behind each of those tries was a
large amountof support from other
players. The players in the scrum
(athankless and unnoticed place to
play) walked all over WCU’s
scrum, one time pushing them
about thirty meters down the field.
The scrum players also did a fan-
tastic job of supporting the backs.
The backs all played an amazing
game as well. They ran set plays
and supported each other in a way
they have never done before. The
game on Saturday showed that the
Wildcats are re-emerging as the
rugby powerhouse that they used
to be.

Men's Tennis Impressive
in Fall Season Opener

By Brannon Buck

The Davidson men’s tennis
team opened its fall season during
Parent’s Weekend with a blowout
win against UNC-Charlotte. Albie
Varoski led the team at the number
one position, winning his match 6-
1,6-2 in impressive fashion. The
rest of the top six, Russell Briggs,
Holt Vaughan, DanGrinnan, Dave
Tonidandel and Ma Syan Harper, fol-

lowed suit to sweep the singles
matches.

Davidson also dominated the
doubles action. Briggs and Harper
wonatthe number one spot, 6-4, 7-
5, and the other Davidson teams
were victorious as well. In addi-
tion to the normal six and three
match format for singles and
doubles, Davidson coach Jeff Frank
arranged to play extra matches

against UNC-Charlotte. These
matches also went well for the
home team, and the final match
score ended 16-2 in favor of
Davidson.

This past Saturday, the team
captured twin 9-0 wins over Queens
and Belmont Abbey. Dave Kim
stood out in singles against
Belmont Abbey; he lost only one,
point in taking a 6-0, 6-0 victory.
