‘The Peanut Parcher

| The following is for the benefit of the!
new men:

The Peanut Parcher, contrary to common
|belief, is not a one-man proposition. It is
|impossible for one petson to hear all the
{good jokes that make the rounds of the!
campus, and it is equally as impossible for
la single person to put out a really good
| Peanut Parcher.
| Accordingly, the only thing that will in-
| Sure a witty and humorous joke section of
| the highest class is the co-operation of every
|member of the student body.

We ask this co-operation from the new
men as well as from the old men’ When-
jever you hear a good joke or a witty saying,
jor anything that is funny, jot it down or!
i keep it in your head and bring it to the Pea-
j nut Parcher editor at 7 Georgia, This will
| be appreciated and will go far toward mak-
| ing this department unequalled among col-
lege publications.

It is rumored around the campus that

by the simple plan of supplying the wants
jot the Freshmen, During the past week
| Shorty sold two dozen radiator tickets, a
| dozen campus passes, nine chapel seats, four
keys to the flagpole, a bottle of reveile oil,

Slim Vaughn says that Claude Sears is so
dumb that he thinks pig-iron is a new kind
of hog tonic.

Tom Baker has finally admitted that the
reason his face is skinned up is due to the
fact that somebody removed the saw-dust

| game at quarter last year, is back running
at his old halfback’s position, and Nick Sap-
penfield is calling signals. Black has de-
veloped into a pile-driving fullback and with
Leggette punting like a veteran, Sapp going
fine in all quarters and Lucian Wells in nice
shape, the backfield seems to be well cared
for. McComb and Hunt, a letter-and-star-
man, ate promising.

Other material of good Possibilities may
be classified as follows: Ends: Pinkney.
Bohanon and O'Neal. Pinkney’s play has
been almost on a par with that of Baker and
Davis.

Tackles: Patterson, Allen and McAlpin.
Patterson is to be remembered for his great
game against the University last November.
Allen has been shifted from the backfield.

Guards: McCauley, Christian, Green and
Smith, The last two played regularly at

this position for the Fresh last year. Mc-
Cauley is a hard-working sub.
Centers: Briggs, McConnell. Both of

these men were a little late reporting on
account of touring Europe. Later results
are expected.

The Wildcat schedule for this fall finds
three teams of last year’s schedule missing—
Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Wake Forest
and The Citadel. In their stead the Red
and Black warriors will be lined up against
the University of Richmond, Wofford and
Lenoir. The game with Wake Forest, for
several decades the interdenominational clas-
sic of North Carolina, is not being played
this year on account of conflicting schedules.
None of these schools are new-comers on

Davidson's schedule, Richmond having been

met in 1921 and 1922; Wofford for-seven or
eight years preceding 1922 a regular on the
Red and Black card, and Lenoir having been
decisively defeated in 1910 and 1911. This
game is being sandwiched in between the
Wofford game on October 11 and the annual |
Davidson-Furman game at the South Caro-
lina Fair in Columbia on the 18th. From |
reports it:scems that Dick Gurley is building
a real eleven at Lenoir-Rhyne, getting stars
from various places. His team will be real
opposition. An eleven like the baseball nine
last spring would mean many upscts
North Carolina football circles.

From a student point of view the schedule |
this year is the best for several seasons, five |
games being played on the new Richardson |
Athletic field. Most of these were formerly |
played in Charlotte. Elon, Wofford, Lenoir,
Clemson( not fully decided on place) and |
University of North Carolina, will all be |
met here. For the first time, Presbyterian |
College of South Carolina will be met in |
Asheville, Rock Hill getting this game here- |
tofore. The N. C. State game will go to|
Pinehurst instead of Raleigh as formerly. |
(The completed schedule is printed else- |
where in this issue). |

The first game of the season will be played
against Elon on Richardson Field here Sat-
urday. The Christian team is to a great
extent an unknown quantity. Rather au-
thentic reports come in that only six letter
men are back, and of these only two are Var-
sity men; also that the team will be very
fast. It is thought that something is being
held in reserve, and that Coach Carboy is
going to spring a big surprise here Saturday.
Rumor has it that Shipp, whose circling end- |-
runs for Trinity brought defeat to the Pres-
byterians last Thanksgiving Day, is working
out with Elon. This is flatly denied by men
