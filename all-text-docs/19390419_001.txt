Earl Mellen’s Orchestra
Will Return To Davidson

For Year’s Final Dances

Friday Night Formal to Be
Featured by Annual Mil-
itary Figure

THREE DANCES IN SET

Popular Maestro Will Appear
Here for Third Time

Earl Mellen and his “Melo-
dies by Mellen” Orchestra will
return to Davidson College to
play for the spring dance set
May 12 and 13, the final
dances of the year.

This will mark the third visit
of Mellen to Davidson. He first
played for the last of the old Jun-
ior Speaking sets in the spring of
1937, and returned to} grace the
fall set of last year.

Three Dances

There will be three dances to
this year’s set, beginning with the
regular Friday night formal. Sat-
urday afternoon a tea dance will
be held, and the week-end will be
concluded with an informal Satur-
day night. The Friday night affair
will last from 10 until 2; the tea
dance from 4 to 6:30, and the in-
formal from 8:30 to 12.

The Friday. night dance will be
sponsored by Scabbard and Blade,
honorary military fraternity, who
will present their annual Military
Ball. The figure will be composed
of members of the society and their
dates.

Mellen’s orchestra is composed
of 12 musicians whose average age
is 23. He is very popular among
southern schools, fulfilling most of
his engagements south of the
Mason Dixon line. He has recent-
ly completed a‘ long engagement
at the Tantilla Gardens of Rich-
mond, Va. At his last two engage-
ments here he received the hearty
praise of all members of the ‘stu-
dent body who attended the dances,

Student Show

Of Loeal Art
Draws Throng

Faculty Committee Judges
Three-Day Exhibit

Last Monday aft
Student Art Exhibj

opened at
1 o’clock, and large crowds of

students and townspeople
thronged -through the rooms
on the ground floor of the
Eumanean Hall admiring the
artistic work of the 15 stu-
dents whose drawings were
displayed there.

At 3:30 yesterday afternoon the
committee for judging the best
paintings, composed of Dr. C. R.
Harding, Dr. K. J. Foreman, Pro-
fessor Chalmers” Davidson, Profes-
sor H. T. Lilly, and Mrs. Philip Pey-
ton, passed their decisions on the
best of five types; those in oil, ink,
pencil, water colors, and charcoal.
The exhibit closed this afternoon
at 5 o’clock and the student votes,
as well as those of others, will be
counted and posted in the near
future. :

Prizes Offered

The college itself took far great-
er interest in this exhibit than in
those held in past years as was
shown by the large number of
students that filled the hall through-
out the hours when the exhibit
was on display. This year cash
prizes were offered by the college
to those students whose drawings
were chosen best by the commit-
tee and the student body. Some of
the contributors have been asked
to lend their works to the Mint
Museum in Charlotte. ,

Some of the kinds of works en-
tered are surrealisms, portraitures,
landscapes, sketches of buildings,
torsos, still life, and many others.
The painting that is apparently
drawing the most attention and
most favorable criticism from the
student body. is a wild surrealism
by Wally Scherer entitled, “Da-
vidsonian’s Dream.”,

Maestro

Popular Earl Mellen will re-
turn again to Davidson for the
third time. He has been secured
by the Pan-Hellenic Council to

furnish music for the Spring

dances in May.

No-Yong Park
Speaks About
War In China

Democratic Nations Will Face
Economic Ruin If Japan
Wins War

Democratic nations in the
future will face economic and
possibly physical ruin if Japan
wins the present Asiatic war,
declared Dr. No-Yong Park to
an audience of approximately

300 in Chambers Auditorium
last Wednesday evening;
After showing the fallacies of

six arguments the Japanese have
put up to show the necessity of the
war, the speaker, who is a native of
Manchuria, pointed out that a vic-
tory by Nippon, while causing a
temporary rise in U. S. exports,
would eventually drive American
markets from Asia. He explained
that Oriental cheap labor will un-
dermine America’s home markets.
Should Washington put up a tariff
wall to prevent this, the Japanese
would forbid imports of American

goods, and the effect would be
the same. ‘»'
Democratic Victory
On the other hand, Dr. Park

pointed out, a Chinese victory will
probably be one for democracy,
since there is where democratic
sympathy lies. A strong nationalist
Chinese state would also serve as
bulwark against Russia and
Japan. However, he warned, should
neither nation win, Russia might
reap the benefits by both na-
tions turning Communist.

The Manchurian closed by dis-
cussing the part the United States
must play in this prevention. He
declared that this nation supplies

Seniors To
Meet With

Professors

Field Day to Be Inaugurated
Thursday; Athletic Events
Planned

The Senior class will spon-
sor a Senior-Faculty field day
Thursday afternoon and night
beginning with athletic events
and ending with a barbecue.

The program committee has ar-
ranged for sporting events to be-
gin at 1:30 with matches in bowling
and tennis. At 3:30 the Seniors will
challenge the Faculty in a game
of softball.

The two groups will retire to the
golf course at 6:00 where the horse-
shoe matches will take place. After
the matches are over the entire
company will be treated to a barbe-
bue supper. Following the supper
the group will an informal
party around the fireside with song,
and probably skits .pre-

ulty.

by

Committeemen
Plans for this program are being
arranged by a committee of three
men—Shaw Smith, and Oscar Arm-

strong with Ovid Bell acting as
chairman of the committee. The
athletic events and matches will

be under the management of Char-
lie Sample and Pete Whittle.

This is the first time that such a
plan for getting the Senior class
and the Faculty together has ever
been put into effect. Both parties
are endeavoring to come to a more
complete understanding of the oth-
er’s problems whereby more whole-
hearted co-operation may be given
between the two groups.

If this Senior-Faculty field day is

terminated by success, there are
indications that it will become an
annual affair on the Davidson

campus.

Frosh Select
New Officers

Members of the rising sopho-
more class began voting Tuesday
for their next year’s class officers,
after candidates had been nomi-
nated at a special meeting of the
