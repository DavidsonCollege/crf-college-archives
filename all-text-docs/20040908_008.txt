JSU: Too much diversity

It seems that the Davidson
College Administration’s fo-
cus on increasing the
College’s diversity has had
some unexpected byproducts.
For the loyal members of
Davidson College’s Jewish
Student Union, the growing
number of Jewish Students
on campus has proven to
have fairly high costs.

“I just can’t believe it. We
have to take two cars to syna-
gogue now for the High Holi-
days,” said JSU head Emily
Cohen ‘o5. “That stupid
freshman makes it six people.
I say double buckle but every-
one else wanted to take an-
other car. I really don’t want
to use an SUV.”

' Other JSU members tend
to agree. As sophomore Brett
Steinthal ‘07 explained, “This
car problem is only the tip of
the iceberg. Even in my two
years here, I’ve been able to
see changes. This past year,
I’ve only been able to explain
the laws of kosher one or two times. I
guess my true worry is that the next
step will be having my mom start ask-
ing why I’m_not going out with a ‘nice
Jewish girl’ because there are so many
here.”

Gentiles are also seeing changes in
the culture of the school. “Sometimes I
feel like I’m in New York or something,”
explained junior Nicholas Livingford
‘06, “During that one holiday, they had
those Jewish Crackers in the Union for
the whole week.” Senior Christina Lee
Nottingham ‘05 also noticed differ-
ences in the way classes are run. “It

grade deflation

A recent independent study commis-
sioned by the Davidson College Commit-
tee on Instruction has debunked the wide-
spread myth of grade deflation at
Davidson. The study concluded that the
report of grade deflation among Davidson
students is actually caused by the
Davidson students’ own academic defi-
ciencies. “After analyzing the level of work
done at Davidson, the researchers found
that the breadth and the difficulty of the
academic coursework at Davidson is actu-
ally inferior than the coursework found at

all eight Ivy League universities, with the
exception of Brown, as well as many of
Davidson’s peer liberal arts colleges,” said
Robert Clark of the educational research
firm of Southeast Education Associates.
“Moreover,” Clark continued, “through
advanced deduction techniques we con-
cluded that if the top 95% of the class of
2006 at Harvard, for example, went to
Davidson they would have a cumulative
GPA of 3.71, thus making Davidson‘grade
inflated.”

Some students and professors disagree
with the study while others are not sur-
prised. “If this is true, then why do most
graduate schools add point six to
Davidson graduates’ GPA? I know that’s
true, my tour guide told me,” said
Kathleen Young ‘o5.

English professor Dr. Cecil Jones feels
vindicated by the study, “Finally! It looks
like the old ‘we're at Davidson’ excuse just
isn’t going to fly. I’ve had enough of stu-
dents-who hand in lousy papers and then
when they get back'a bad grade, just
blame it on Davidson grade deflation.
This place really isn’t the hotbed of intel-
lectualism that people say it is.”

Alex Marks ‘07 was worried about the
study. “Keep this one under wraps. Well
at least don’t tell my parents.” said Marks
before heading down to PiKA on a Tues-
day night. -

club, I have to cut down on the ‘Jesus’ ref-
erences. But, I do see some positives, as
I’m sure that in my future professional life
I will need to know how to interact with
the Jews.”

Some on campus believe that there
could be more Jewish Students, and that
the College has not gone far enough in
making them feel welcome. Describes
JSU member Eli Friedman ‘06, “Come

on! I mean, they served Challah in Vail
Commons during Passover [a Jewish holi-
day in which it is forbidden to eat leav-
ened bread]. They still don’t allow a Jew
to be a trustee. They want us here, but
they don’t want us to interfere with their
‘Christian Tradition.”

The Administration takes a more chari-
table view of the state of affairs. According
to admissions councilor Charles Mont-
gomery, “Even though we still have a long
way to go, we have niade some tremen-
dous strides. The numbers of Jewish Stu-
dents has risen exponentially, and with it
has come increased discussion in classes
and alternative outlooks which signifi-
cantly enrich the classic Davidson stu-
dents’ educations. Plus, this whole discus-
sion of not having enough room in one car
to go to Yom Kippur services is absolutely
ridiculous. They should only need one car
this year as Yom Kippur happens to fall
on the same weekend as homecoming.”

Cohen still believes that there is a prob-.

Jem and has a response, “I just think
Davidson College should strive to stay
keep my people out like it used to five
years ago. I chose to go to this school for
a reason. If I wanted more of my type, I
would have gone to Duke.”

Caterpillar

convention
turns ugly

Tragedy struck last week at Davidson
College after the 19" Annual Convention
of Yellow Gutted Caterpillars ended in
chaos. For cost reasons, the caterpillars
again selected Davidson as its location for
the fall even though in the past, the con-
ventions have ended nastily, for both
Davidson College students who resented
the deluge of caterpillars, as well as the
caterpillars themselves who found thou-
sands of their brethren crushed by care-
less students.

While members of the college adminis-
tration were wary of again having such a
volatile crowd of caterpillars wandering
around the campus at all hours of the
night, the convention was approved, as it
would bring in a large influx of funds
sorely needed to cover the costs of th
soccer field renovations.

So, after consulting campus security
and determining appropriate safety mea-
sures for this event, the college went
ahead with the plan to host the conven-
tion.

The caterpillars maintained a tolerable
noise level throughout the first several
days. Though some freshmen’s parents
were perturbed by the presence of so
many caterpillars as they went with their-
children to orientation, student/caterpil-
lar interaction was largely calm and cor-
dial.

Over the weekend, however, a large
group of caterpillars known as the “Leaf
Eaters” was refused entrance to a local
bar. Owner Tom Ackerson later ex-
plained, “I was called out of my office
around nine or ten o’clock. They were in-
toxicated already.” The leader of the
group persisted and eventually overpow-
ered Ackerson at the door, forcing his way
to the bar. When the bartender refused to
serve him, a full brawl broke out.

From there, bad went to worse. The
police recorded twelve reports of women
being harassed by caterpillars, and some
thirty men were injured in the pandemo-
nium that ensued. While this alone would
have been an unpleasant incident, it later
turned into a major catastrophe. Out-
raged at the treatment of their fellow in-
vertebrates, the entire convention decided
to carouse and vandalize Davidson’s cam-
pus.

With the aid of Davidson’s Orientation
Team and select volunteers, the campus
police were able to squash some five hun-
dred caterpillars before the freshmen
knew of the revolt, thus preventing cam-
pus-wide panic.
