RIAA catches f five students
illegally downloading music

By JackiE MCKEON
Senior Staff Writer

The Recording Industry Associa-
tion of America (RIAA) contacted
Davidson College between Oct. 27
and Nov. 9 about five students who
violated copyright laws due to ille-
gal music downloading and sharing.

“The RIAA had traced two copy-
righted songs to my computer, mean-
ing I inadvertently downloaded
copyrighted music from another
source, and since I was file sharing,
I could have distributed the copy-
righted material,” said Heidi
Wilbrandt ’07, one of the five stu-
dents confronted by the RIAA.

Davidson College reacted to the
notices by shutting down the students
internet access until the offending
material was removed.

The RIAA did not take any further
legal action once students removed
the material.

“If we do not take action, they take
action against us,” said President
Bobby Vagt.

The RIAA represents the U.S.
music industry and is responsible for
pursuing and punishing those who
violate copyright laws.

The RIAA website estimates that

the music industry loses nearly $300 -

million every year due to music pi-
racy.

Penalties are severe for those
charged with the online infringement
of copyright music.

The offender can be punished by
up to 3 years in prison and $250,000

in fines, regardless of their student
status.

The copyright laws surrounding
music downloading and sharing can
be vague and confusing. Copyright
laws prohibit the unauthorized dupli-
cation, performance or distribution
of a creative work.

“It is a pretty good guide that any
site offering a variety of music for a
fee is legal and any offering free
downloads is illegal. Some groups
have their own site and offer free,
legal downloads, but they are the
exception,” said John Casey, head of
Internet Technology Services.

Last year, the Motion Picture As-
sociation contacted Davidson Col-
lege about six students who had
downloaded films illegally.

Students removed the offending
material and no further actions oc-
curred.

Davidson students have been
lucky.

In both cases involving copyright
infringements, no further legal ac-
tions occurred once the students re-
moved the illegal material from their
computers.

Students at Hamilton College i in
Clinton, New York have not been as
fortunate.

“At Hamilton, students have had
to hire attorneys and battle court sub-
poenas,” said Dean of Students Tho-
mas Shandley.

Colleges and universities across
the nation have recently received
notices from the RIAA about illegal

CCRL questions accuracy
of College’s marketing

By ADAM MarTIN AND KATE GILLESPIE
News Editor and Senior Staff
Writer

Atarecent Council on Campus and
Religious Life meeting, Davidson’s
current ties to the Presbyterian
Church and its commitment to the
Reformed tradition of Christianity
raised concerns about how accurately
the college represents itself to pro-
spective students.

“I don’t think we have discussed
enough how Davidson’s openness
about its religious affiliations plays
out in admissions,” said Fred Smith,
assitant professor of economics and
a member of CCRL, the President’s

advisory board.

The College’s statement of pur-
pose clearly describes Davidson’s
commitment to the Presbyterian and
Reformed traditions in its opening
two paragraphs. The statement can
be accessed online, 3 clicks from the
Davidson College home page.

Yet most prospective students
never read the statement before en-
rolling at Davidson, and rely on tour
guides and admissions publications
to learn about the college.

“When I first came down to visit,
I was never made fully aware of the
fact that Davidson was affiliated to
the Presbyterian Church,” said Ross

Death leads to
safety reforms
on trails

By Carey BAXTER

Staff Writer

A middle-aged man died of a heart
attack three weeks ago while running
an 8k on Davidson’s cross-country
trails. Medics arrived about half an
hour after he collapsed. The tragedy
has caused Davidson administrators
to implement major safety reforms
on the trails.

The 51-year-old man was running
with his wife when he collapsed. She
began performing CPR and yelling
for help. Pam, a flight attendant for
US AIR, is trained in CPR.

About ten minutes later a young
woman came running by and then
went for help. The young woman met
Don Williams ’08 on her way out of
the trails. Williams had a cell phone
and made the first of two 911 calls.

The ROTC members had run into
the young woman who told them
about the situation. They had trouble
finding the couple.

When they arrived at the scene,
two ROTC members, Cadet Natalie
Rowe ’06 and Master Sergeant Gen-
eral Heyward, began doing CPR for
the wife. Cadet Chris Hallett 04 ran
to find acell phone and make the sec-
ond 911 call and give the ambulance
better directions to the victim.

The young woman also met Presi-
dent Bobby Vagt on her way back to
campus and gave him directions to
the couple. Vagt had trouble follow-

Sewage surges through Rich

Residents ask for higher lottery numbers as compensation

By BEN WHIGHAM
Senior Staff Writer

A recent surge of sewage through
a dorm room sink has caused two of
the students who reside in the base-
ment of Richardson to request better
housing lottery numbers as compen-
sation.

Freshmen Dom Ippolito ’08 and
Sam Hotchkiss ’08 felt their unde-
sirable rooming assignment warrants
a high number among their class in
next year’s lottery.

According to reports from the two
roommates, Hotchkiss.and Ippolito

entered their room to discover sew-

age flowing up through their sink’s
drain.

Neighbors Don Williams ’08 and
Brian Benoit ’08 also found sewage
in their sink.

The cause of the flooding was
traced to acotton towel that had been
flushed down a toilet.

RLO provided a full cleaning of
the two rooms.

The residents who had suffered the
flooding were brought to a meeting
that included President Bobby Vagt
and Director of Residence Life Leslie
Marsicano.

When the students were asked for
suggestions on how to handle the

situation, they suggested better lot-
tery numbers.

The residents argued that the sink
incident justifies improved housing
next year.

- “Because of our great disparity in
freshman year housing, we feel we
should have advantageous lottery
numbers to level the playing field,”
said Hotchkiss in defending their
position.

The current lottery system ran-
domly assigns students numbers that
establish the order in which students
get to pick housing.
