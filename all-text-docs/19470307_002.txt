of this first advantage is that the council
will not be afraid to contract for a good
band, and having more money to pay for
it, will get a better orchestra, Finer dances
will result. a

Set Fund

In the second place. the new plan will
mean cheaper tickets. Formeriy, the council
was atraid to count on more than 500 men
at a danee, out of a student body of 900.
I:xpenses run, let us say, in the neighbor
hood of $5.000 a set. It takes no genius to
sec that each ticket will cost S6. Burt ii.

-price of each admission can drop to S35.
‘That's simple arithmetic. bui it helps the
pocketbook, nevertheless. And 100 more
men should mean more stags.

Frats Responsible

And lastly, the change means that the
responsibility tor the financial success of a
dance is taken from the representatives and
placed entirely with the fraternities, where
it belongs. After all, the representative is
not putting on a danee for his own plea-
sure: he’s been elected by his chapter to plan
a danee for them. He's giving his time and
his energy. and believe us, it takes. plenty
of both. should he be askd to give his
pockethook as well? That is what will hap-
Ten too often it he has to continue to work

Social or Not?-

Naturally, there are two sides vo this. as
therearc Lo every question, Some will argue

betore the war, cannot be doubled to mees |tsat dance attendance should be voluntary |

ihe corresponding inerease in cost. The
solution, therefore. must lie clsewnere.

Under the new proposal. each fraternity
will guarantee to the couneil the equivalent
of at least 85% of its total membership for
each danee. Tn addition, the finaneial re-
sponsibility will be lifted entirely from the
shoulders of the individual representative.
and placed on the fraternities alone. with
each fraternity sharing 1/9 of the profit
or loss, Tickets will oe soid to independent
students on the wluntary basis used now.
A board consisting of one or two repre-
Seniatives from each social organization
will have the right to check périodicaliy on
the Pan-Hellenie Couneil to see that all
funds are being spent in @ reasonable and
economical manner.

The advantages cf this plan over the old
one are-manifest, in che first and strangest (
place, the council will have a set fund that
it can count on, and a fund thai should
also be larger hy some 20%. In the past
planning for a dance was nothing more
than groping around in the dark. The num-
ber in attendance had to be estimated, the
total income had to be estimated, the price
of tickets therefore had 10 be estimated,
thewhole process was one olnestimution..
Sometimes this system worked: sometimes

--it didn-t; The late Midwinters Setrwas
time it didn’t. The council overestimated
the number in attendance at the dance. and
lost some $300 in the doing. As a result,
they are now afraid to “stick out their
necks” again on the Spring Set, and may
decide to play it safe with a lesser-known
orchestra. hoping to make up in part what

ro this we say no one is being forced to
go. necessarily. The S3%s clause Jeaves a
cushion of 15% of each fraternity to take
care of members who are on athletie trips.
who are sick, who can't afiord to zo, etc.
In addition, the difference may be made
uo by taking money from the treasury. if
the chapter wills, and repaying iit from the
profits at the end of the vear. That decision
is the chapters’: they may assess each mem-
bet if they like; don't. they assess 100%

for individual fraternity (unetions ? After|-

all. everyone pays an athletie fee, if he

doesnt go to a game all year he pays for|-

a concert ticket, anc prebahly 25% of the
student body attends them. And we arc
social frateraities.

.\gain, some may shy away from freeing

ithe representative of responsibility, using
‘the argument that he wili work farder if:

he has a financial interest-of his own at

dake. Work harder for what? Enough
money? The new olan gisarantees him

cnough, without the necessity for _ his
knocking himself out needlessty. And the
inspecting board shotld be = sufficient
guarantee that the council doesn't squan-
der the money foolishly, even it the frater-
nities fail to choose as their representatives
the capable..and conscientious shcen—they.
should. _

There are flaws. in any plan one couid
offer. We liclieve, however that this- new
‘block systenr’ offers by-far the most ad-
vantages for the least disadvantages. Da-
vidson is the only school we know of that
uses the system we now have: we hurt
ourselves by being differnt.

SIGMA ALPHA EPSILON —
_ Tt might well be said that. the
North Carolina Theta Chapter of
Sigma. Alpha Epsilon could have
had its weekly-meeting in either
Greensboro or Chapel: Hill last
weekend, for all the big wheels of
our fraternity were at one or both
of the above mentioned places.
Probably the main reason for this
was that Brother Dick Port partici-
pated ins the Southern -Gonference
Indoor Track Meet in Chapel Hill.
Brothers Jim Harris, and “Meat-
bal” Gambrell had to spend qujte
a bit of time sweeping the excess
sughy out of 10 Georgia after Dick
wot back, for he had received ‘more
than ten letters from his Memphis
women while he was gone. (1t was
nat reported how many more than
ien he received. for neither Jim nor
‘Meatball’, strange ‘to say, had
more, than that number of fingers
on which £9 count.)

Besides those that journeyed to
the track meet, the only other ones
that were industrious enough to go
to any place but Charlotte were
Ford Little, who went to Winston-
Salem, and Dick Richards, who
traveled to his home in Laneaster,
South Carolina.

The past weekend was relatively
quiet for the Pikas, though some of
the boys managed to stir up some
trouble. Pledge Homo Ellis took an
extended weekend around Golds-
boro, and is slowly but surely re-
cuperating. Brother Dockery spent
a “quiet (2?) weekend in the hills,
while Brother Double Dip MeNair
operated j i ne_‘till 4
wee hours of Sunday morning.
Brother Fanjoy was finally located
in Statesville, where it seems he
spends most of #his spare time.
Brother Leonard visited in Elkin,
but_his mind wandered jn a States-
ville direction, where Brother Boyd
was putting in spare time on his
Spanish lessons—first hand. Broth-

“A-SCANDAL IN) PARIS”
This is a romantic comedy told
like a fairy tale portraying th
transformation of Vidocq from a
daving: rascal to the Prefect of the
Paris police force. Set in the 1800's
the picture is beautifully done and
characterizations are well perform-
ed. . George Sanders plays Vidceoq
and is supported by Signe Hasso,
Carloe Landis, and June Lockhart.

Asis usually the way Americanos |

try to, build up Paris as real Den
of Iniquity. Thus in carrying out
this policy the National.Legion of
Decency says about “Scandal
Paris,” . . . suggestive song, dia-
lorue, situations and costumes.”

of the wife of the mob’s leader.
Things begin to pop out -as Holly-
wood will always have’ it—happy
-is the ending. There is to be found
a very powerful background in the
music which is supplied entirely by
a piano. Others in the cast are
Michele Morgan. Steve Cochran,
