Game With

Carolina Saturday

The Wildcat nine at this writ-
ing have only a somewhat dis-
mal record to present. On Mon-
day night of this week (with a
game scheduled with South Car-
olina Tuesday which may mean
a victory) the diamondmen have
a record which is entirely devoid
of wins. Chances seem slim, also
for the prospects to brighten not-
iceably immediately. But the Cats
seem to have a remarkable facility
for losing games in somewhat queer
fashion. Once a lost ball and a
short fly barely in the home run

Cats a game; the supposedly sound
infield gave way to the extent’ that
a revision was necessary; against

breaks, but fate seems to have been
handing the nine an uneven dish.

his ‘first turn on the mound was

AGAINST THE HEELS.

Coach Shepard's charges meet
the high riding Tar Heels here on
Saturday and should be ready to
play a close one. In their last
meeting Lefty Cheshire, big Sop-
homore, shut out the Cats and
fanned 12 while his mates tallied
10 runs off nine hits. Saturday’s
contest might be a good ball game.
Although, no announcement has
been made, Mac Morris will prob-
ably handle the mound assignment.

CINDER GLANCES.

Here in Richardson Stadium last
Saturday the visiting Tech from
V. P. I. outran and outhrew the
Davidson track men by 70 2-3 to
SO 1-3, strange enough the same
score by which the Cats won the
week before. With a clean sweep
in the javelin, discus and the mile,
the visitors needed only two first
more than their opponents, 8-6 to
win by a 25 point margin.

A change in the scoring records
may be effected, however, as a re-
sult of letters now being exchanged
between Coaches Whittle of David-
son and Yonger of VPI. It seems
that the Virginians threw a disc
in the discus throw which weighed
approximately a pound than
the Davidson plaque, and which is
official only for high school com-
petition.

The nine point difference which
a Tech forfeit in the event would
change the score to V. P, I. 64 2-3;
Davidson 59 2-3—a very close track
meet. It would not, of course,
change the deciding results of the
afternoon, but would give the loss
a much more encouraging atmo-
. sphere. Times were, in general,
faster than the preceding week,
and except for the few slip-ups
which cost the day; the cinder-
men looked impressive.

Day after tomorrow, the track-

men go to Raleigh to meet State.

Pikas Top Volley Ball
As Final Round Begins

With only one more round of
play, the Pikas had a strong bid
for first place in the interfraternity
volley ball tourney with seven wins
to their credit and no losses. The
Kappa Sigs were in the second po-

Sition with six victories out of
seven games.
The SPEs, with 4 wins and 2

losses, were third and the Phi Delts
fourth with three wins and two
losses.

PIKAS OUTSTANDING.

The Pikas were outstanding from
the first in the tourney and played
consistent ball throughout. Levi
Sink and Herb Rainey have looked
especially good. Led by Shep Booth
and George Marsh the Kappa. Sigs
also showed up well. Andy Dale
for the Phi Delts and Bill Hamil-
ton for the SPEs have been out-
standing.

SPEs FOLLOW.

The Phi Gams, led by Jay Bolin,
followed the SPEs with three wins
out of six games. The KAs were

were the SAEs led by Hector Mc-

IN EARLY LOSS TO HEELS.

The Wildcat baseball team plays
two important Southern Conference
games this week, one against the
University of South Carolina Tues-
day in Columbia, and with the Uni-
versity of North Carolina here on
Saturday.

Neither the Wildcats nor South
Carolina” has won a conference
game, and Tuesday’s tilt offered a
chance for one of the teams to
break into the win column.
Davidson met North Carolina in
a previous encounter this year in
Chapel Hill. Lefty John Cheshire,
a 200-lb. junior, let the Cats down
with four hits, and the Tar Heels
won the contest by a score of 10
to 2.

WILDCATS THREATEN.

The Wildcats threatened only
once when Jack Clark, who played
right field, hit a mighty triple with
one away, only to be put out trying
to steal home.

The Cat batsmen fared little bet-

ter the next day at Duke, when
sophomore. Frank Seward _ held
them to six hits and one run in

chalking up a 7 to 1 victory for the
Blue Devils.

The Davidson ball club lost their
fourth straight game in as many
starts Friday to the Guilford Quak-
ers on the home diamond by a
score of 12 to 8.

It was a heavy~hitting-affair,-in

Virginia Tech loomed as a threat
