Pat was equally at home on a hardwood
court as on a baseball diamond. He made
his letter and two stars during the four
years at Davidson. At the end of his first
year on the quintet he was elected captain,
and in his Junior year led the team to a
j very successful end. Again athletic review-
ers and coaches saw in Pat a man of stellar
| worth, and he was chosen as an All-State
guard. In the last year that he was with
| his Alma Mater he played at the guard po-
|sition again, and even in this berth he was
high scorer for the season. Pat seldom fol-
dom followed his shots up, for there was no
need. His main position of shooting was
from the center of the floor, and the hearts
of opponents no doubt took a downward drop

WRESTLING MAT BURNED
IN SMALL FIRE AT GYM

On Wednesday, January oth, at 7:30
Pp. m., a small fire destroyed one of the
wrestling mats at the gymnasium. Bas-
ketball practice was being held when
Charlie smelled the smoke and discovered
the fire. He quickly spread the alarm,
and Mr. Van Sant, who was near, ap-
peared with a fire-extinguisher. With
the aid of Captain George, who is ever
present in the time of fires, Mr. Van
Sant was able to put out the blaze with-
out difficulty.

The damage done was very small as
the mat destroyed was an old one. It
was extremely fortunate that the fire
was discovered so soon because if it
had been given more time a disastrous
conflagration might have resulted.

The origin of the fire is unknown, but
there are several theories about it. The
most likely one is that a match was drop-
ped upon the mat sometime during the
wrestling practice in the afternoon.

South’s Sweetest Singers
Are Booked For Davidson

Emory University Glee Club Will
Play Before Local Audience

One of the most attractive musical en-
gagements of the year that the
Emory University Glee Club, which is
scheduled to give a performance here
in-the college auditorium on February
7th. This aggregation of songsters is
one of the most popular organizations
of its kind in the south, and has been
given by the leading newspapers of the
southern states the title “South’s Sweet-
est Singers.”

It will be remembered that the Emory
club made the longest tour last year that
has ever been attempted by a southern
college musical organization, giving a
successful concert in Havana, Cuba. This
was the first concert to be given on for-
eign by a southern college glee
club, and the Havana newspapers were
enthusiastic in their praise.

The sixth annual fall tour was begun
on December tst, and covered the states
of Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Louisiana,
and Mississippi. The fall tour is stated
to have been the most successful in the
history of the club and at every point the
singers were praised for their splendid
entertainment exhibiting artistic en-
semble work and amazing versatility.

The program this year is entirely new
and different. The first half, under the
direction of Doctor Malcolm H. Dewey,
well-known glee club director, is devoted
toa number of compositions of
Beethoven, Handel, Schubert, and other
masters, and is one that will appeal to
lovers of music of the higher type. In
this half also, Alton O’Steen, versatile ac-
companist and a veteran on the piano,
will give several selections. With the
second half comes a change from the
sublime to the ridiculous. A feature is
the screamingly funny English farce,
“Charley’s Aunt,” revised especially for
the Emory club.

A full concert orchestra accompanies
the Emory singers, and these instrumen-
talists give a variety of numbers ranging
from an overture by Offenbach to the
latest jazz.

is of

soil

The varsity quartet, an in-
strumental foursome, and Samuel Proger,
noted young violinist, have special num-
bers. Another pianist, Tommy James,
tickles the ivories in the jazz session.

The club will make its tour in a special
car bearing a large Emory banner, and
a large audience is expected to welcome
the South’s Sweetest Singers at their
concert at Davidson.
