‘There is evidently some foundation to
the report that a tank will be set up
here.

Man’s greatest blessing is opportun-
ity; man’s greatest sin is neglected op-
portunity.

There were only fifteen men glad to
see the Spring term begin. ‘They stayed
here during the holidays.

What everybody says: “O, 1 could
have made the Honor Roll, too, if I had
only tried.

Greenland and the Social Center are
alike in not expressing the real condi
tions.

The days are cold and dark and dreary
Ie sleets and the wind is never weary;
On the campus once so fair,

Naught is green but the Freshmen there.

Which is the worse off: the man whe
made a New Year's resolution and
broke it, or the man who did not make
any?

Is there such a thing as Davidson
Luck (i. e.. hard luck)? Tf not D. C.
should have had the State championship
in foot ball, basket ball and base ball.

DEBATING.

“Reading maketh a full man.”

“Writing maketh an exact man.”

“Speaking maketh a ready man.”

Depth exactness and a ready tongue
are qualifications which ore at a big
premium. All three of these may be
gained by work on debates. The ex-
perience gained in that line is invalu-
able. Any one who can think when on
his feet facing an audience and has the
gift of smooth speech can go far. Noth-
ing enables an ambitious man to do this
like practice in public speaking.

In this issue of the Red and Black
the Debating Council announces the de-
bates for the year with the dates ut
which papers must be in and the time
for the preliminary contest. All those

‘ho are in any way interested in sucl
hings should make a note of the variou
etails concerning the contests they arc
Jigible for and start to work. The tim
*; shorter than usual so data should b
-ollected at once. * * *

The opportunities offered in the lin
f forensic work are unusual. Every
‘ody eligible owes it-to themselves t-
nake a try at least. Success mean
‘onors and power,

You, like the rest of us, are here fo
an education. This means an increas
‘n knowledge and improved carriage an’
manners and if possible the acquisition of
‘hat ease of manner and polish whic
listinguishes the educated man. Pub
Nic sneaking helps give vou all thes
hings. Therefore the debates and at.
tendance in the literary sncieties is neces
‘ary. Its worth while. Take an inter
st in it.

Put something in. Evervthing lies
Sefore vou. Make vour college career
1 broadening influence instead of usine
it as a means of confining the mind te
ane channel. Breadth of view is neces-
cary and the above mentioned phrases
af college life tend to that end. Put
something in and you will get somethine
out. But put vour work in so the mind
will be equally developed. Learn to
speak with the silver tongue of an
arator and the world lies at your fect.
Begin to learn now.—FEx.

CHRISTMAS AT DAVIDSON.

During the holidays about fifteen

attended a Christmas tree at Shearer
Hall, and all got a full stocking. One
of the boys acted as Santa Claus, Christ-
nas day was very quiet.

Sometimes the bovs would go out
kodaking while at other times they read
quite a bit and played games, such as
-ook and checkers. Occasionally some
af the boys would leave the Hill for a
few days.

The weather was verv unfavorable.
and basket ball was practically the only
snort indulged in. Most everv afternoon
‘he boys would go out

Two games were played with the town
boys in which the college boys lost the
first, 12 to 16, but won the second, 11 to
10. Both games were played at night
and were well attended.

A few parties given by the young
ladies of the town were enjoyed very
much. On New Year's night the boys
gave a masquerade party to the young
ladies at the Social Center. About sixtv
attended and the narty was chaperoned
by Dr. and Mrs. Fulton.
