College Maintenance Installs

New Lighting For Trial Use

By BRUCE CORSER
Staff Writer

Davidson's maintenance
department is in the process otf
experimenting with different
tvpes of lighting around the

campus to help improve
security.
During the summer.

temporary overhead hookup
lights were installed in certain
areas on the campus. Lights
were placed in areas in front of
Chambers, surrounding the
dorms. and around the fine arts
building.

This was done as a part of the
total effort to make Davidson
more secure. especially since
the advent of coeducation.

Grover Meetze. director of
the physical plant, pointed out
that these lights were samples
being used on an experimental
basis to determine the best type
of lighting for Davidson.

Permanent campus lighting
will then be effected in three
phases.

The first phase,
encompassing the area around
the fine arts building and the
dorms, will be completed by
“next July at a cost in the
neighborhood of $10,000,""
according to Meetze.

The second phase, around the
Patterson Court vicinity, and
the third phase. including the
church and Dana building will
be finished over a period of
several years.

Meetze said that ‘“‘these
phases are flexible, and the
Student Security Committee is

Mi TRO

going to make
recommendations before any
standards are set. In fact any
student reaction to lighting is
welcomed.”

Meetze related that “since
about 1958" plans have been in
the works for some permanent
lighting.

He added that the last budget
appropriated money for for the
development of lighting and
that permanent fixtures could
have been installed during the
summer.

The delivery period was from
six to eight weeks though, so
Meetze felt that to install
permanent lighting over the
summer would have been
rushing the situation.

“We aren't delaying,” he

said. *“‘We just need more time
toexperiment.”

He went on to say that he has
to come up with the right type ot
fixture which will harmonize
with campus architecture. He
added. “To be aesthetically
correct, wires will be
underground.”

“There is a conflict between
trying to beautify the Campus
and trying to improve
security,’ he said. *‘A person
should feel secure, but not
exposed."

In an effort to maintain a high
quality lighting, an
incandescent or a_ color

corrective mercury vapor
fixture will be used. Meetze
thought that the plain mercury
vapor lamps would have too
much of a glow.
