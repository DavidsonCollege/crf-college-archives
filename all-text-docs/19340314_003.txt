UNIFORMS DESIRED

Lingle Praises Band, Encourages
Free Will Offering

The Davidson Concert Band opened
its first season with a concert Thurs-
day night in Chambers Auditorium and
a similar concert Friday at Lenoir
High School, The concert at~Steele
Creek, originally scheduled for last
Monday night, was postponed a week.

Both concerts. drew large audiences
from Davidson alumni and music lov-
ers of nearby cities who called for
numerous encores,

“We are proud of our band and we
are proud of the other musical organ-
izations at Davidson,” said Dr. Walter
Lingle, in a talk at intermission of
the Thursday night concert. He stated
that the most significant development
at Davidson this year was in the mu-
sical line under the direction of Mr.
Pfohl, and announced that Mr. Pfohl
would be able to give all his time to
our music department next semester.

Dr. Lingle reminded the audience
that music, besides being uplifting and
idealistic, was also expensive because
of the necessary equipment, and con-
cluded his talk with an appeal to the
audience to make a liberal free will
offering, so that the band might pur-
chase uniforms,

At Lenoir the members of the band
were received by the homes of the city
as the guests of the Lenoir Band, J.C.
Harper, alumnus of Davidson, conduc-
tor. The Lenoir Band will be the guest
of the Davidson Band at its concert
here Thursday, March 15.

Harris Bradley, first chair clarinet-
ist of the band and assistant to Pfohl
in his work, was presented the baton
for two numbers at Lenoir. They were
“Men of Ohio,” by Fillmore, and Al-
ford’s march, “Vanished Army.”

Trees Planted By
Local Boy Scouts

Davidson Troop Completes Re-
forestation Project

On Monday and Tuesday afternoons
Davidson Troop No. 1 of the Boy
Scouts of America planted 1500 lob-
lolly pines on a tract of land just off
the fifth hole of the golf course.

This project was carried out by 12
boys of the Scout troop under the di-
rection of Edwin S. Hodge, scoutmas-
ter of the troop.

The tract of land on which the re-
forestation was done is a piece of land
which was lumbered several years ago
and since then has been-washing badly.
This project will not only prevent the
land from washing, but it will also
beautify it.

The seedlings used in this work
were furnished by the State Conserva-
tion Commission and paid for by the
college. This project was done not
only to beautify the land but also to
give the scout troop some practical
experience in reforestation. The work
was suggested by Rufus Page, former
scoutmaster of the troop and student
at the college.

Hodge announced that in the cam-
paign recently conducted by the troop
to collect old clothes and furniture, 324
pieces were collected. These were col-
lected not only in the college, but also
in the community. This campaign was
made following President Roosevelt's
suggestion to the ‘Scouts of America
that they collect old clothes and furni-
ture as a national “Good Turn.”

The value of these articles was ap-
aren aatle $30; they will be turned
over to the local Red Cross for dis-
tribution.

Dr. Gammon Speaks
On Vesper Program

Dr. Edgar Gammon of the Myers
Park Presbyterian Church in Charlotte
was the speaker for vespers Sunday
night, March 11. Joseph E. Dill, of
the Senior class, was in charge of the
program. After the singing of a
hymn, the audience was led in prayer
by Ben Rose and Harvey Glass, The
prayers were followed by the scripture
reading, and a violin solo by Bill Rob-
inson,

Dr. Gammon chose as his topic,
“What Lack I. Yet?” which had to
do with the value of a true religion
and the. benéfits that could be re-
ceived from it in after life.

“Young men and women should
learn to know about Christ while they
are still young,” said Dr. Gammon. An
example of this fact was brought out
in the story of the rich young ruler’s
meeting with Christ. Despite wealth,
personality, high morals, honesty, and
even a slight religion, this young man
lacked the true religion of Christ, and
he greatly desired it. However, when
he was told to give up his riches and
follow, he could not bring himself to
do it, and thereby passed out of the
story completely. He lost by this the
supreme opportunity of his life. “In
the light of eternity, he lost every-
thing,” said Dr. Gammon.

Following the singing of a hymn,
the speaker dismissed the assemblage
with the benediction.
