Orten’s What the Butler Saw brings comedy to studio workshop

By TIM BETUEN
Staff Writer

The playbill says Joe Orton’s
What The Butler Saw is “A
hilarious and outrageous farce
for a mature and sophisticated
audience.’’ The play deals with
‘‘a wild melee of disappear-
ances, disguises, and discov-
eries’’ when a state inspector
visits a mental hospital.

Davidson’s Drama depart-
ment is presenting What the
Butler Saw this week.

“This play has a very com-
plex plot,’’ Drama Professor
Rupert Barber said. ‘‘There are
all sorts of changes in costumes
and identities. It is not a
particularly racy play, but it is
a sophisticated one in that it
deals with issues from homo-
sexuality to necrophilia.”

Barber chose this: play be-
cause he believes it to be the
best of Orton’s three plays (the
other two are Entertaining Mr.
Sloan and Loot). Orton was
killed at the age of 36 by his
lover. Had he lived and kept
writing, Barber believes he
might have been the modern
Oscar Wilde because of his use
of wit and verbal play. ‘‘I
wanted to do this play because
it is a type of comedy not
commonly done here, for the
experience of it, and also to
expose students and audiences
to Orton,”’ Barber said.

The cast has had only a few
problems with the play. The flu
outbreak last week cut into
rehearsal time, and ‘‘sometimes
the lines have been difficult
because the action is wild and
constant,’’ Barber said. “Also
the constant changing of cos-
tumes made it difficult to

remember the right characters
in rehearsal.”’

The cast is comprised of four
seniors— James Baskin, Peter
Collins, Nelson Simon, and
Julis Weber; and two fresh-
men—George Booth and Mar-
garet Ervin. ‘Those seniors are
veterans on our stage,’’ Barber
said, ‘George and Margaret are
just marvelous.”’

Ervin said she was ‘‘very
surprised’”’ to get the part of the
secretary in the play. ‘‘The
seniors did intimidate me at
first, but not now. No one puts
any pressure on me.” Ervin
added that getting used to the
undressing (cleverly called
““costume changes’’) has taken
some work, especially since the
effect is to be humorous and not
merely bawdy.

“A lot of the humor of the
play is in the word play, which
is sometimes difficult,’’ Ervin
said, ‘‘because it’s not just the
words but the way you take the
things that the characters say.”
Aside from working on timing
and costume changes, Ervin
said she has not had many
problems with the play. ‘“My
part isn’t that hard, but the
others are trying out things and
getting comfortable with the
flow of the play.”’

The situation of the play is
important, Ervin said. ‘‘All
these characters are so wrapped
up with themselves that they do
not intend to make light of their
situation. I laugh at these
characters a lot. I have to stop
doing that.’’ Ervin said her
character is a ‘‘naive girl, reared
in a strict home.’’ She does not
realize she is being seduced by
the psychiatrist to whom she is

He gets out of her clothes,
but then another psychiatrist
shows up, and thinks she is a
patient. Then ‘‘everything
starts to go crazy,’’ Ervin said.

“TI have enjoyed working in
this play because I think it is a
good play,” Ervin said, ‘‘and
because the cast is fun. We have
a good time together.”’

Baskin, who plays the psych-
iatrist, has just come from
playing Mr. Gant in the Fall

production of Look Homeward

Angel. ‘‘In this play the girls
are a problem,’’ Baskin quip-
ped.

‘‘T have enjoyed this play
more than any of the others,’
he said, ‘‘It’s amazingly funny!
The play get funnier every time
we do it, at least to me it does.”’

Baskin quickly added that
the play had not been easy. ‘All
rehearsals are happy and frus-
trating to me. This show re-
quires me to keep in character
for an hour and a half, which is
something I have never done

“IT think a lot more students
should try out, I tried out
because I’m a drama junkie,”’
Baskin said.

College bowlers prepare for tournament

Staff Writer

This team practices with
trivia books, not a basketball.
Team members don’t run laps,
but they go through two to
three hundred questions in a
single two-hour practice ses-
sions. Instead of training with
weights, they read books, mag-
azines, and newspapers. This is
College Bowl, sometimes called
the ‘‘varsity sport of the mind.”

College Bowl has been a
winning sport at Davidson since
the late 1960’s. Davidson’s 1969

College Bowl A-Team won five
games and $20,000 in scholar-
ship funds on the popular “GE
College Bowl’’ TV program,
which ended in 1970. David-
son’s 1979 A-Team captured the
National College Bowl Champ-
ionship, winning $5000 in schol-
arships.

On March 16, Davidson’s
1980 A-Team, ranked in the
nation’s top 8 teams, will go to
Charlotte to compete in the
National College Bow] Champ-
ionships. According to Senior
Tim Newcomb, A-team member
for both 1979 and 1980, David-
son has a strong program. “I
don’t know how we'll do in the
nationals, but we’ll have a good
time.”

“College Bowl is a whole lot
of fun, and a way to learn things
you may never use again,”’
sophomore Brad Mullis, B-team
captain said. Newcomb said,
“It gives me a chance to meet
super people and to get to know
them....Fun:that’s the key
word. If it weren’t fun, I
wouldn’t do it.”

When asked why he is willing
to spend up to ten hours a week
in practice, Newcomb said,
“When we practice a lot, it’s
because we enjoy it, not because
we have to.”

‘Topics for questions can be
anything, ranging from cooking

- to television to U.S. Presidents.

Possible, questions include

‘What aré.the main ingrediénts

in Russian Dressing?”’, ‘‘Who is
the voice of Bugs Bunny?”’, or
‘‘Which President’s middle
name was Milhous?”

On Jan. 27 both the A-team
and the B-team will compete in
an exhibition tournament in
Charlotte under the aegis of the
Charlotte Area Educational
Consortium. Both teams will
then go to the UNC-Charlotte
Invitationals, also an exhibition
tournament, on Jan. 31. Feb.
12, the A-team will travel to
Johnson City, Tennessee to
participate in the Region V
Competition.

On March 16th they will
compete in the National College
Bowl Championships to.be held

in Charlotte.

German Professor Hansford
Epes coaches both the A-team
and the B-team. Epes, Physics
Professor Bob Manning, and
English Professor Emeritus
Charles Lloyd, the former
coach, work closely together
preparing the team for the
national competition.

A-team member Julie Gibert.
said Professor Epes is an ex-
ceptionally good coach who
devotes a great deal of time to
the teams. He goes on every
trip with them. ‘‘He calms us
when we get temperamental and

‘upset before a match,” Gibert

said.
“Getting to call him ‘Hans-
ford’ is one of the privileges of

‘ being on the team,” added

Mullis.
Members of the A-Team are

- Newcomb, Gibert, Ed Trum-
-bull,;.Bob Evans, and alternate
“Marvin Overby. B-team mem-

bers are Mullis, Gordon Turn-
