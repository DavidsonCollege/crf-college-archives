parents in weekend match

By JOHN BURNS

The gentlemen’ Ss soccer team, pre-
paring for a showdown with fifth
ranked South Carolina on Tuesday,
electrified an overflow Parent’s Week-
end crowd on Saturday by beating an
overmatched Georgia State team 3-1.

Tracy Hankins started the scoring
with a goal off of an assist from Rob
Vest. Rob Ukrop followed and Phelps
Sprinkle finished up with a strange,
slow paced goal in the second half.

cocks.

The score could have been much worse
as most of the action took place on the
GSU end of the field.

The Wildcats turned in an out-
standing defensive effort, turning back
nearly every Georgia State penetration
and keeping the ball on the good side of
midfield for most of the afternoon.

Tennis: new courts
and promising team

By ROBERT GRUBB

The men’s tennis team celebrated
the dedication of. the new Howard
Covington Tennis Courts with an im-
pressive showing against Furman last
weekend. The men squared off with
Furman in a
normal format
on both days
and then
teamed up with
the women to
play mixed
doubles’ on
Sunday.

Unof fi-
cially, the Wild- °
cats lost 8-6 on
Saturday, but
won 6-2 on
Sunday. Offi-

were not kept,
because of an

matches were
played with ten

four doubles
poss. The
coaches and players decided to forgo
the doubles on Sunday.

The weekend tournament, which
also featured the women against Fur-

| man,-demonstrated: the. versatility: the

additional hard courts bring to the ten-
nis program. Theseven new hard courts
will allow ‘the men’s and women’s

teams to practice simultaneously. The-

biggestad vantage, however, will be the
possibility of scheduling men’s and
women’s matches on the same day.

“We hope to be able to schedule
matches together during the spring sea-
son,” said men’s coach Jeff Frank.

“Having the two teams playing to-
gether will make the matches more of a
pectacle and more fun from the specta-
tor standpoint. This way we hope to get
bigger crowds out.”

The weekend tournament with
Furman was the fourth event of the

season for the Wildcats. The team lost to
VPI 5-4 to open the season. The Cats
played in another tournament at Wash-
ington and Lee, and defeated both
UNCCand Wofford in dual matches. In
both of those matches the team played

doubles teams both won on Saturday.
Zabelland John Beyer teamed up to win
atnumberone. Hagood, playing second
doubles with Dale Voeks, returned
from his injury to beat his old doubles
partner.

These two victories pleased Frank,
who said he will be emphasizing
doubles this during the off-season.

“We have very even team ability in
singles and some good doubles play-
ers,” he said. “This fall I’m going to try
to find the best doubles combinations..”

The fall season will close on Friday,
but Frank said he may try and schedule
another match at homecoming.
