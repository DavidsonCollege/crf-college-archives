Union Board Recommends A Site

By RICH WILSON
Managing Editor

In a meeting with College
President Samuel R. Spencer
Jr. Wednesday night, the Union
Board presented its formal re-
commendation that Union acti-
vities be temporarily relocated
in the Guest House until a new
Union is constructed.

Although the board considered
the laundry, Jackson Court and
Chambers Banquet Hall as pos-
sible alternatives, they finally
decided that the Guest House
offers the most location advant-
uges.

A report which studied the
four alternatives said the loca-

tion of union functions in the
Guest House would allow for
coordinated programming with
Cunningham Fine Arts Center
and the Honors College.

This location is also close to
the dormitories thereby provid-
ing students with accessability
to the Union. And it is far
enough away from the class-
rooms so that loud program-
ming would not disturb aca-
demic programming.

The major disadvantage of
this site is that there would not
be enough room for the offices
of the Student Government Asso-
ciation, THE DAVIDSONIAN,
Quips and Cranks and WDAV.

The report suggested that two
houses on Jackson Court could
house these organizations.

If this recommendation is a-
dopted by the administration,
the report suggested that Guest
House patrons may be housed
in Richardson Dormitory or un-
der the stadium. Of if a girl's
dorm is indeed built, Gray
House could be converted into
a guest house.

Preliminary estimates of the
cost of converting the Guest
House into the Union were about
$3500.

The Union Board considered
the laundry building as a pos-
sible site for the temporary

ufiion since it was close to the
dormitories and the eating clubs

One disadvantage of this lo
cation, however, was that it
was too far away from large
programing areas such as Love
Auditorium, Hodson Hall and
Perkins Auditorium.

This proposal was finally re-
jected on the basis that the
cost of converting what is no
a factory into a union structure
would be exhorbitant. Prelimin-
ary estimates surpassed $100,000.

Chambers Banquet Hall seem-
ed to be a good central loca-
tion in relation to most college
facilities, but this site also pos-
sessed some disadvantages.

elections Bill

Lear said that

ALEXANDER

GRAY WILSON

Peeples and Alexander will of-
ficially appear before the stu-
dent body to present their posi-
tions in a combination speech-
es—Open End at 10 a.m. Mon
day, Jan. 10.

Running for Editor of THE
DAVIDSONIAN are Rich Wil-
son and Gray Wilson, and for
Editor of Miscellany are Frank
Erwin, Bob Bolick, and, as co-
editors, Joe Earle and Jim Han-
na.

Jim Campbell and Miles Ward
are opposing candidates for the
presidency of the Social Coun-
cil, and Paul Yarborough and
Wilson Gurn are the contend-
ers for Vice President of the
YMCA,

Running for sophomore repre-
sentative to the Hearing Com-
mittee are Rick Love, Steve
Dodd, and Buck Farrow. Con-
testants for the two junior posi-
tions on the committee are
David Bender, Jim Lehnberg,
Steve Johnson, and David Dug-
gins. The candidates for the

id Varner, Butch Barton, Joel

Competing to become man-
ager of the radio station WDAV
are Robert Corlew and, as co-
managers, Jeff Allender and

The positions which have

dent of the Union, Stan Has-
singer; YMCA Secretary, Woody

RICH WILSON

Connette; YMCA _ Treasurer,
Tom Parks; Defense Adviser,
Gerry Bello; and Student Soli-
citor, Randy Ely.

No candidates registered for
either the Review Board or
Off-campus Senator, so the re-
gistration deadline for those of-
fices, and the election date, has
been extended to coincide with
those of class senator, the regis-
tration deadline being 5 p.m.
Wednesday the 12th and elec-
tion day being Tuesday the 18th.

Lear said that voting proce-

dure would be as usual, with
the polls in Chambers Lobby
open from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.

“The votes will be tabulated
by the computer and the re-
sults should be in by 5 o’clock
Tuesday afternoon. Any runoffs
will be held the following day,”
Lear said.

In addition to elections for
campus offices, a referendum
will also be held Tuesday in
which the student body will de-
cide whether write-in votes
should be accepted in elections.

It would be to near the dirt
and noise accompanying the
library construction and would
not be near enough to the frat-
ernities. It also would provide
little room for offices and stor
age.

The report said that this al
ternative would cause students
to feel “shut off into a corner.”

Estimated costs for this alter
native ranged from $5,000 - $16,-
000 depending upon the degree
of renovation.

The final alternative was
Jackson Court. The report sug
gested that Union activities be
distributed over six of the
houses. This proposal also call-
ed for a central multi-purposed
facility to be located adjacent
to Hobart Park and __ behind
Jackson Court.

The advantage of this site is
that it is accessible both to the
students and faculty as well as
“outsiders,’’ but the disadvant-
age is that activities will be
dispersed in too many direc-
tions, and that is too far remov-
ed from the mainstream of ac-
tivity.

The final decision on _ the
Union will be made by the pre-
sident in consultation with his
vice presidents. Spencer. asked
that students and faculty discuss
the plans for the temporary
union and submit any sugges-
tions they might have.

“We want imputs from all
ccnstituencies before we make
the final decision,’ Spencer
said.

Spencer also noted that once
the administration had made
its final decision, the matter
would go to the Budget. Build-
ing and Grounds Committee of
the trustees for final approval.

Candidates Present Views
On Major Campus Issues

By BOB HOWELL

The duet of candidates vying
for SGA President, DAVIDSON-
IAN EDITOR, and Social Coun-
cil President presented their
platforms this week for Tues-
day’s election.

Bill Alexander and Ralph
Peeples will compete for the
office of SGA president.

Alexander has been a mem-
ber of the senate since his
freshman year. He was on the
senate committee dealing with
the recent governance revisions,
and is presently a member of
the Senate’s Executive Council,
RHA President, and SGA Vice-
President.

Regarding his platform, Alex-
ander said, “‘The first thing I
feel strongly about is the idea
of board being included in the
comprehensive fee.’ He felt that
this policy was a personal af-
front to every student by re-
stricting his freedom.

Alexander went on, ‘‘Second-
ly, and just as importaft, is
coeducation. Davidson is in
trouble now, and coeducation
has to come soon.”

He observed that the coeduca-
tion question implied other
measures, such as low-cost hous-
ing for the greater number of

married students which would
result, and from there, a re-
vision of the college’s offcam-
pus living policies.

Ultimately, Alexander sees a
need for some form of co-oper-
ative governing board between
the students, the faculty, and
th Administration, which would
help to bridge some of the gaps
between the three.

He added, ‘As far as the area
of national politics is concern-
ed I don't feel that the senate
should get into it at all, but
rather we should stick to cam-
pus issues.”

Ralph Peeples is currently
Junior class senator and a hall
counselor and earlier this year,
was instrumental in the hall
counselors’ coeducation petition
and the subsequent talks with
the administration.

According to Peeples, a most
distressing situation and one
of his primary reasons for run-
ning is, as he called it, the
‘“‘perverted set of priorities”
upon which the college seems
to operate.

He felt that the policies of
the college seem to be shaped
by financial considerations ra-
ther than by reflection on the
well-being of the student body,
the single most important con-
stituent of the Davidson com-

munity.

“The quality of life here at
Davidson is in need of some
improvement and the senate is
responsible to the student body,
which elected, it, for doing all
that it can in this capacity. And
if the proper channels for this
do not exist, then I intend to
do all that I-can to create such
channels,” he said.

Peeples felt that coeducation,
a share in the responsibility of
governance, as well as financi#il
and legal services typify the
type of considerations that the
SGA should push for in the fu-
ture to make Davidscn much
more livable.

The candidates running for
editor of THE DAVIDSONIAN
are Gray Wilson and Rich Wil-
son. Gray Wilson has been As-
sistant Managing Editor and a
Managing Editor. He has work-
ed cn two weekly newspapers
as a photo-lab technician and
was presented with the Thomas
Nelson Page Literary Award
by the Philanthropic Society.

Concerning his plans for the
paper, Gray said, ‘‘I’ve got two
basic aims if elected — first
to broaden the paper’s format
to include types of writing once
a part of, but recently dropped
from, THE DAVIDSONIAN.”
