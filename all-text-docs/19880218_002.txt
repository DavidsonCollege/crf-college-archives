Class of ’88 chooses gift, plans fund-raising drive

By MUADI MUKENGE

The member of the class of
1988 recently voted to provide
funds for improving computer-
related services as their gift to
Davidson College. More than half
of the 356 seniors participated in
the voting.

According to the proposed
Statement for the Class Gift of the
Class of 1988, the funds are “de-
signed to strengthen and expand
the college community’s techno-
logical capacities.”

The gift committee is currently
debating methods by which to

improve Davidson’s computing .

facilities. Suggestions have in-
cluded innovative solutions to the
computer shortage problem, such
as the establishment of a “library”
of portable computers which stu-
dents could “check out” and use in
their rooms after regular com-
puter facilities had closed.

Overseeing the voting proce-
dures and fundraising is the Senior
Class Gift Committee, chaired by
Caryn Coppedge and Alan Comp-
ton.

According to Compton, seniors
are “really enthusiastic” about the
computer gift idea... ““we’re ex-

cited to be able to help.” In addi-
tion, he continued, the Davidson
computer services staff is grateful
and excited about the commit-
ment.

Suggestions for gift ideas were
submitted by the senior class dur-

ing the latter part of January. Ac-
cording to Compton, other possi-
bilities the seniors considered
included an international student
scholarship, a student service
loan, a satellite dish, money to
improve the language lab, and a
low interest student loan. The
computer facility improvement
program received the majority of
votes.

During spring term, a team of
several dozen senior class
“agents” will solicit their class-
mates for contributions to the

“Davidson college endowment.

Compton said the fundraising will
continue over a five-year period,
at the end of which it is hoped that
from $50,000 to $60,000 will have
been raised. This capital will be

placed in the Davidson College .

endowment. The annual interest
gained from it will be allocated
from that time onward to the
computer facility improvement
program.

Senior class president David
Corssaid of the contribution to the
endowment, “It’s been done this
way at least since 1983, to get
away from just giving a class
bench or something. That’s just
kind of trivial. And it’s a way to
keep giving to the school, too.”

Coppedge said seniors will be
offered three payment options: 1)
a graduate student plan, whereby
one pays an annual low premium;
2) a working plan whose premi-

ums increase each year; 3) and an
Alenda Society plan by which
Students pay the highest premi-
ums and give $150 the fifth yéar,

thereby qualifying for member- -

ship in the Alenda Society (an
honorary circle of Davidson
alumni. who have contributed
$150 or more to the college).

It is not certain at this time

whether the class will wait to raise

the entire gift amount before it

makes any donations, or if alloca-
tions will be made directly from
the interest accrued from spring
term pledges. :

Union Board to purchase laser printer

By MARGARET CARROLL
The Union Board is purchasing
a new computer and laser printer
to be used for publicity and graph-
ics.
Union Board President Eric
Whytsell said that the Union al-
ways attracts people as long as

—they_are_informed-about-Union— sibility, but-we’ve since-decided——The-Union Board’s-compu

events, and the Union hopes to
produce a campus-wide, regular
and informative newsletter that
will helpto publicize those events.

Union director William Brown
said, “We had in mind a computer
that would help us with publicity
functions of the Union, specifi-
cally tickets, programs, flyers,
and a possible newsletter.” He

said that the system will include a
Hewlett-Packard Laserjet printer
and either an IBM Model 30 or a
Model 50.

Brown said, “The Union Board
is not purchasing the printer for
students to use to print papers and
résumés. We considered that pos-

that it’s just not possible.”

Brown says that the Union staff
may also be purchasing a com-
puter and laser printer, but as of
now the budget has not been ap-
proved.

The Union itself is looking at
the possibility of working with the
computer center and providing
another printer for student use.

Brown hopes that the Union
would be able to place the printer
in the game room, where it would

be used by the staff until 3:00,

when the game room opens, and
could then be open to student use
for printing their résumés and pa-
pers.

and printer will cost approxi-
mately $5000. Brown said that the
money will come from an unex-
pected surplus in the board’s
budget resulting from a Duke
Endowment grant received about
two years ago. -

“Suddenly we just happened to _

have $6,500,” Brown said, adding
that the Union prefers not to use

surpluses to fund its regular pro-
grams, but spends them on capital
investments instead. “That’s how
we purchased our video editing
equipment,” he said.

If the Union staff budget allows
for the purchase of another
printer, it will be open to student

use for specified hours while pro-
viding the staff with a variety of
new presentation options. There-
fore even if only the Board is able
to get the printer now, the Union
will be able to continue to expand
its services and try to meet student
needs,

Any student who suspects
that he or she may have been
exposed to chlamydia should
see a doctor. The college phy-
sicians hold sick call at the
Davidson infirmary on week-
days from 1:30 to 3:00. All ex-
aminations are carried out in
complete confidentiality.
