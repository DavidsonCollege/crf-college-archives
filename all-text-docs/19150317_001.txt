QUEENS COLLEGE GLEE
CLUB TO COME SOON

One of the highest class entertain
ments of the season at Davidson will b
here next Monday night, March 22
when Queens College Glee Club give
their concert under the auspices of the
Athletic Association. ‘lhis organization
needs no introduction to Davidson men.
as all know of the high class reputation
of everything connected with Queens
College.

This is the second time this Glee
Club has been seen at Davidson, having
come up last spring for a concert under
the able management of “Bum” Pharr.
All of the old students know what a
pleasing concert was given last year.
From all. reports coming trom) Queens
they have a much better Glee Club this
year than last. Under the able leader-
ship of Miss Carol Baker the club has
shown ability not often seen in organi-
zations of this sort.

Miss Baker is a celebrated Marchesi
pupil, and has met with great success
throughout Europe. She has a reper-
toire of more than ten operas, including
“Monon.” “Lakme,” “La Boheme,
“Romeo et Juliette,” ‘Faust.” etc.

There will be twenty-four members
in all in the Glee Club, and they will
arrive on the night train. from Char-
lotte. The concert will start promptly
at 8:15 p. m., and all are urged to be
there promptly in order to get a seat.

Every loyal Davidson man should be
present at this concert for several reas-
ons, chief of which is the fact that they
will be here under the auspices of the
Athletic Association. and every ticket
sold is just that much toward bringing
good base hall to Davidson this spring.

The members of the Glee Club will

be entertained in the homes of the facul-.

ty. and the management wishes to take
this opportunity to express their hearty
thanks to all who have so kindly and
willingly offered them enterfainment.

Spring training has begun in horse
shoe throwing. and this annual game is
as popular this season as usual.

ANNUAL BUSINESS.

W. A. Mellwaine and J. bk. Faw,
the editor and manager of the Annual,
found it necessary to take a business trip
to Atlanta last week to see Foote &
Davies, the publishers of the 1915 An-
aual. Te seems that Foote & Davie

wwe changed the manager of their col-
tegiate department. and as many of the
arrangements made with the former
manager were merely verbal, it became
necessary for more definite arrange
ments to he made and for certain points
of business to be cleared up. McIlwaine
and Faw returned from their trip Tues-
day noon.

DR. REAVIS GIVES
SPLENDID ADDRESS

Last “Thursday night: the Davidson
YY. M. C. A. enjoyed one of the finest
addresses ever heard at Davidson, when
Dr. J. O. Reavis, Professor of the Hing
lish Bible at Columbia Seminary. spoke
of his recent trip to the Congo Mission
in Africa.

Dr. Reavis started at New York and
proceeded to take his hearers over every
part of his trip. Possessing all the qual:
ties of a good speaker, Dr. Reavis also
has an unique way of picturing differ
ent scenes and events. As he described
his trip up the Congo river his hearer
seemed to see the beautiful scenery, the
luxuriant tropical plant life, and the na
tives on the banks. So great a hold) did
Dr. Reavis have on his audience that
he could have his hearers laughing heart
ily one moment and almost shedding
tears the next. His account of his est
ing ants, killing a hippopotamus, and
“hitting the continent of Africa” several
times were exceedingly funny.

On the other hand Dr. Reavis closed
with a stirring appeal for more men to
help supply the yreat need in Africa at
this critical time.

As an evidence of how his audience
enjoved Dr. Reavis’ address, he was
given quite an ovation at the train as he
left soon after the meeting.

DR. B. F. WILSON TO
PREACHES HERE SOON

Dr. B. F. Wilson, of Harrisonbyrg.
Va., will preach the Commencement Y.
M. A. Sermon here. Dr. Wilson
is an old Davidson alumnus, was for|}
twelve years President of Converse Col-
lege, and is at. present the pastor of a
large church in Virginia. ‘The Y.
C. A. is fortunate in securing him.

Huntersville.

On “Vhursday. the i8th, the Varsity
played the All-Stars in the tirst game of
the season, It showed that the aggre-
gation is fast rounding into: shape, but
due to the tact that such men as Cash-

ion, Booe, "Py Cobb" Caldwell, and
Coach Fetzer, composed the All Stars,
the Varsity was defeated by the score of
Sto 7. However, they equaled — the

All-Stars in hitting, “both securing nine
bingles.

Christenbury has started the season
tight on the bases, swiping tour sacks
duting the game. Captain) Altord ts

three hase hit anda single. Somerville,
Black and Saunders did some fine field
ings.

Cireom started an the rubber for the
Varsity, and in spite ot the fact: that
he has been suffering with a sore arm
for some time, pitehed well. Lawson
replaced him in the fourth, and let the |
All Stars down with one hit, Caldwell
securing, that. Morris was sent) in an
the seventh to replace Lawson, and
shawed up well,

The fielding of Cashion and Booe
plaved an important part ins the local’s
defeat. Caldwell led the ATL Stars wath
the willow, securing four hits out of five
times at bat. Ulowever, they seemed
unable to steal bases on Captain Al-
ford'’s quick and accurate peg

The outheld) seems slow in rounding
into form, but the material is good. and
in the course of time they will come
around all right.

On Saturday, the rath, the Varsity
crossed bats with Hfuntersville, but it
must) be taken into consideration that
Cashion and Booe, with their splendid
playing, were ino the line ap against

Davidson. ‘Vhe Varsity displaved much
better team work than in the gaine with
the AL] Stars on ‘Thursday, since the hit
and run and the base stealing, were pull-
ed off more effectively. And due to this
fact the game resulted. ina victory for
the Varsity, the score being 7 to 6,

Rooe was on the mound for the visit-
ors, and kept ‘the Jocals’ hits scattered.
Davidson's southpaw, McKeithan,
started the game, and showed — good
form. He was relieved in the fourth by
Daftin, who also did well. Morris was
used again from the sixth to the ninth.

Christenbury again’ showed — mid-
season form on the bases. Vhe infield
seemed to work better as a unit and the
outfield showed signs of improvement.
And it could be clearly seen that the
whole team was greatly benefited by
‘Thursday's game and is fast) rounding
into form.’ {
