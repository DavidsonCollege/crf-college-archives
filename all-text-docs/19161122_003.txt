A COMPOSITION ON HENS.

A little Kansas bov wrote this com-
position on hens: “Hens is curious
animals. They don’t have no nose, nor
no teeth, nor no ears. The outside of
hens is generally put into pillars and
feather dusters. The inside of a hen is
sometimes filled up with marbles and
shirt buttons and sich. A hen is very
much smaller than a good many other
animals, but they will dig up more to-
mato plants than any thing that ain't a
hen. Hens is very useful to lay eggs
for plum pudding. I like plum pud-
ding. Skinny Bates eat so much plum
pudding once that it set him into the
collerv. Hens has got two wings and
can fly when they are scart. J cut my
Uncle William’s hen’s neck off with a
hatchet and it scart her to death. Hens
sometimes make very fine spring chick-
ens.”—Successful Farming.

CLEAN YOUNG MEN
IN POLITICS

Some men make the halding of publi
office their sole business. From it they
derive their entire support. Provided
they administer their trust fearlessly and
honestly there is nothing about this to
be condemned. But it is a good sign
when young men of wealth and social
position enter politics, not for what they
can get out of it, but for the oppor-
tunity it affords to serve the State. Lf
more young men of independent means
with the best education entered public
life in this spirit it would greatly up-
lift our political standards.

Mr. Ogden Mills, lof New York
City, a young man of this type, in ad-
dressing the members of the Laymen's
Efficiency League of the Episcopal
Church told the men of the church that
it was their duty to enter politics and
fight corrupt persons and influences.
this duty includes more than primary
registration, or voting, or mere consent
to the governing party. “You must
see,” said Mr. Mills, “that good princi-
ples dominate and good men are chosen
for the organization as well as for the
offices. Then, from this application of
good citizenship to party problems, we
inay hope to see grow a new standard of
success in life, in which mere commer-
cial prosperity or great wealth will not
be the sole criterion, but where he will
be judged as most successful who has
contributed most to the great brother-
hood of the nation of which you and I
are a part.” If more young men enter-
ed politics in this spirit it would mean
the end of the compact and strongly en-
trenched ‘Tammany Hall in New York,
and of corrupt politics everywhere.

One great element of strength of the
public service in the British Empire has
been the wav in whith men of wealth
and leisure have devoted themselves to
the service of their country. In the
United States we have made the great
mistake of misinterpreting the motives
of those who would enter the political
arena in the same spirit, doubtless be-
cause we have been so accustomed to the
celf-seeking type of politician. —Ex.

Oh, I like to start the morning with an
apprehensive sigh,
For I find a bit of worry to my taste.
But I cannot help a-thinking as the
years go speeding by,
That an awful lot of worry goes to

Little Boy—‘‘Never. We have moral

“What's that?”

corners, and locked out, and locked in,
and made to write one word a thousand
times, and scowled at, and jawed at,

WHAT THE PRINTER LIKES. |WHEN THE FROST IS

Vhere is a man the printer loves, and
he is wondrous wise; when’er he writes
the printer man, he dotteth all his i's.
And when he’s dotted all of them with
carefulness and ease, he punctuates each
paragraph and crosses all his t's. Upon
one side alone he writes and never rolls
his leaves, and from the man of ink a
smile the mark “insert” receives. And
when a question he doth ask—taught
wisely he hath been—he doth the goodly
penny stamp, for postage back, put in.
He gives the place from which he writes
—his address the printer needs—and
plainly writes his honored name so he
that runneth reads. He writes, revises,
reads, corrects, and rewrites all he can;
and keeps one copy safe and sends one to
the printer man. And thus by taking
little pains, a trifling care and cost, as-
sures himself his manuscript will not be
burned nor lost. So let all thase who
long to write take pattern by this man,
with jet-black. ink and paper white do
just the besr they can; and then the
printer man shall know and bless them
as his friends all through life’s journey

ON THE PUNKIN

When the frost is on the punkin and the
_ fodder’s in the shock,

And vou hear the kyouck and gobble of
the struttin’ turkey cock,

And the clackin’ of the guineys and the
cluckin’ of the hens,

And the rooster’s hallylooer as he tip-
toes on the fence;

QO, it’s then's the times a feller is a-
feelin’ at his best,

With the risin’ sun to greet him from
a night of peaceful rest,

As he leaves the house, bare-headed and
goes cut to feed the stock,

When the frost is on the punkin and thé
fodder's in the shock.

—James Whitcomb Riley.
