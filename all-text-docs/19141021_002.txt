THE BASKET CALL.

For two weeks the basket call has
been heard, and a score and a half of
class warriors have turned out daiiy to
practice for the class games, wich pre-
cede the Varsity season. “Lire games thus
far have been snappy and weil-played,
and fine. Varsity prospects are before us.
Basket -ball will probably piay a far more
important part in’ Davidson s athletics
than ever before. Lf the Varsity: games
exhibit as much ginger as the ciass teams,
and the student bedy shows as) much
cothusiasm as the classes are showing
over the inter-class games this year, a
successful season is assured.
REPORTING TO THE COUNCIL

A large number of new men have
asked haw to proceed if they should wish
to report a man to the Student Council
for any violation of the Student Body
Constitution. All such matters should
go, of course, as soon as possible, ro the
President of the Student body. But two
or more students may report: any in-
fringement upon the honor of the stu-
dent body to any single member of the
Council, whom ‘they prefer. He will
carry the charges to the President, and
a meeting of the Council will then be
called. Phe names of the members of
the Students’ Council are printed in the

Hand-book.

TOBELR MAGAZINE
RELIEN ED.

OC

The purpose of the, Davidson College
Magazine has always been to afford an
avenue for the expression of the students’
thoughts ina clear, polished manner.
The Magazine Nas aftorded an avenue
for literary expression such as has been
found neither in the class room nor the
literary societies. In thus bringing out
the latent literary talent of our college
and giving it a chance to develop, it has
done a good work, but at the same rime
it has been felt by many that not as many
students were taking an interest in. this
phase of college endeavor as should. Ac-
cordingly a motion has been passed by
both the literary societies according to
which every member will have to hand
in at least one piece to the Magazine
each year. As an inducement to good
work on these literary creations an
amendmont was added which gave a
credit to each member whose piece was
reported on favorably by the Adagazine

'Ttalian friend,

Ihe DAVIDSONIAN. October 21, 1914

It is hoped that this requirement of the!
societies will bring, out some really good |
literary material and add much to our,
Magazine.

‘phe wectuact number of the .Waga-
zine perhaps is not as large as the ordi-
nary number, but this can de easily exe:
cused in view of the fact thar it takes
at least one month for the staff to sertle
down to work after the Summer's vaci-

tion. “However, tire
lacks in quantity this time it makes up in
quality.

Meoaatight on the Campus is a pretty
picture of the Davidson campus in’ the
languorous, moonlit, siaimer  mghts.
The only ching lacking te make it real
is the husky crv of “Fire!” as a automo-
bile loaded with ‘Phessies” skims around
the walk.

Cuele Tlenry’s Cittle Atasso. written
by [.. A. Chambliss, has very good de-;
scriptions of Southern life in some ruray
districts a few years back. On the whole
this story shows talent for su young an

The Age of Young. sien, by FLT
Harkey, is a stirring appeal to the young!
manhood of America to come to support!

stresses the importance of our present!
activities not only as a preparation’ ‘for!
future life, but for what can be gotten
out of them now.

Lhe Fishing Smack is a
jolly little poem: about how a young man
was caught by a “rosy check and two
eyes of blue.” Before we get through
with the poem we almost envy the young
man his fate. The Fishing Smack leaves
a pleasant: taste in our mouths which
will not soon be forgotten.

Such is the Magazine for this ‘month,
and while we know next month’s issue
will be larger, we can only ask that it
have the quality of this manth’s Maga-
zine.

ABSENCE COMMITTEE
ON THE Jor.

That the: Absence Committee is no
joke hase been demonstrated more than
once here lately. It seems that some
members of the Freshman class, not be-
ing quite so well acquainted with con-
ditions here as they thought, considered
it unnecessary to attend chapel and
classes unless thev felt like it; and
theught that the absence committee was
nothing more than a coupie of students.
‘They have since found out differently—
and some to their sorrow, However,
though at times the committee — seems
stern and unrelenting, they are. trying
to benefit the students by keeping a rec-
ord of all absences and sending — out
warnings lest one fall under the con-
demnation of a facaley ruling.
