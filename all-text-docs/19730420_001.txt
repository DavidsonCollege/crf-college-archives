Lottery Leaves

By TOM BRUCE
Associate Editor

Last week's lottery for
student housing for fall term
left one hundred students
without beds.

“If you are asking me what is
going to happen. the answer is
that no one knows for sure,”’ ex-
plained Mrs. Scotty Nicholls,
Director of Student Housing.

‘Lam starting an all-out cam-
paign to encourage students to
live off-campus.

“I believe that there are still
rooms available if the students
are willing to do the leg work
necessary to find a place. This
may mean going all the way to
Huntersville.” she said.

Nicholls indicated that she
has been on the telephone
checking on leads and helping
students to run down
possibilities.

Earlier this year a letter was
sent to every member of the
faculty and every person whose
name appears on the list of
townspeople who are willing to
rent to weekend guests.

“The response was very
small,"’ Nicholls reported, ‘‘but
in light of the situation, I plan to
send out another letter right
away.

“I will be calling the real
estate offices, looking over the
lists of addresses from past
years, and granting the right to
move off campus to larger num-
bers of students than ever
before.”’

Nicholls indicated, however,
that administration officials
would like to ‘‘avoid having
sophomores living off campus,”
at the same time acknow-
ledging that the biggest
squeeze in the room situation
falls on the sophomore class.

‘Actually, the increasing
number of incoming freshmen
was not the crucial factor in the
room shortage,’ said Mrs.
Nicholls.

‘‘We have had large freshmen
classes for the past three years.
Therefore, when the admissions
office calculated that 713 up-
perclassmen would pay the $100
deposit, they were almost 100

students short. This is where
the biggest increase has been
felt.

“TI see no solution except to
freeze the enrollment for next
year, ‘commented Nicholls.

One pleasant suprise to
emerge from the continuing
worry over housing is that the
likelihood of students being
asked to “double up” has
diminished.

“Our shortage is not just
rooms, but beds. dressers, and
closets. It would be practically
impossible to order furniture
for next year without a long
wait anda huge capital out-lay.

‘Furniture ordered long ago
for the center section of Duke

100 Students Homeless

Dormitory will not come before
August.” explained Nicholls.

“I am very resistant to the
idea of students living three toa
room in our dormitories.

“Anyone who has examined
this situation should be im-
pressed by the fact that the
rooms are simply too small for
three people with their books
and clothes.”’ she said.

Nicholls said that the
suggestions to have students
“double up’ always come from
people who are unfamiliar with
Davidson dorms.

“Tt is the obvious solution, but
not the right one. in this case.”
Nicholls said

The large barracks in the

basement of Richardson, with
26 beds. has also been men-
tioned prominently in
speculation about the housing
crisis.

“I would certainly hate to
have to house students down
there. Currently there are ten
students living there already.

‘Using the larger room full-

time would add 26 students.
for a total of 36 using one
bathroom.”’

Nicholls described chances of
aquiring temporary buildings.
as have been used on some cam-
puses, as ‘slim.’

She said that there had been
resistance in the past to the idea
of employing rented portable
buildings.

‘I think that this problem will
be solved by. housing students
off-campus. I think that there
will be more rooms available in
September than there are now.

“The situation is not frozen.
Maybe more students will be
lost through attrition than in
past years; maybe more will
get married over the summer, ”’
she explained.

Nicholls stated that in past
years the better rooms have
sometimes not become
available until the end of the
summer

“I don't think that students
who have not found off-campus
living should be discouraged.
The situation is bound to
change.” she said.

Ervin Calls Impoundment Illegal Tactic
For Curing Deficit Spending Problems

By BRUCE MALOY
Managing Editor

In an entertaining and_in-
formative speech delivered to a
capacity crowd in Love
Auditorium Wednesday night,
Senator Sam J. Ervin Jr. gave a
firsthand summary of the im-
poundment crisis.

“No notion,’ said Ervin,
“more pernicious was ever in-
vented by the writ of man than
that any of the Constitution's
provisions could be suspended
under any circumstances."

‘As I see it. that is what is in-
volved in the impoundment con-
troversy.”’ Ervin continued.

‘‘Whether the President.
granted that his motives may
be good, can suspend the
provisions of the Constitution.”’

Senator Ervin, covering a lot
of legal ground rapidly, outlined
his feelings on the matter and

Housing Planned
For Lake Norman

By TOM AINSWORTH
Contributing Editor

Davidson's tight housing
situation, due to worsen in the
next few years, might get some
relief in the near future if a
projected two and_ three
bedroom apartment complex,
due to be built nearby, is com-
pleted on schedule.

According to a story printed
in last Sunday's Observer,
the Tallahassee-based firm of
Symon Ryals & Associates, a
commercial real estate com-

pany, purchased a 36 acre tract '

of land from the estate of Ralph
Clontz, on which they plan to
built apartments.

The Clontz farm is just within
the Davidson city limits and
borders on the Iredell county
line. Approximately 10 of those
acres are located on Lake

OPEN END

Open End on The
flonors College
April 24, at
10:00 p.m. in” the
Morrison Room of the
Union.

Tuesday,

Norman, in the general vicinity
in back of the General Time
plant.

The company bought the land
for around $6000 per acre or
roughly $216,000.

Leo P. Baker of Syman Ryals
& Baker, the Charlotte affiliate
of the Florida company, said
that the project was ‘‘a venture
which was at least worth giving
a look at.”

‘Everybody builds in larger
towns, but nobody considers the
smaller ones,"’ Baker said. *‘We
felt that there was enough of a
market in Davidson due to the
college and_ its overall
proximity to Charlotte.”

In the newspaper article,
Baker stated that the company
was hoping to complete the
smaller unit apartments by the
coming fall, depending on a
variety of variables, notably the
weather and financing.

Over the phone, however,
Baker confessed that. that
viewpoint was “‘probably more
optimistic than realistic at this
point.” “‘We're working on the
project as fast as we can,” ad-
mitted Baker, “but on a more
realistic note it's been a very
wet winter, and many of your

the sections of the Constitution
which support him.

Citing an incident in which a
deputy attorney general was
testifying before his sub-
committee, Ervin said that the
deputy defended President
Nixon’s impoundment on the
basis of Articles one and two of
the Constitution.

Ervin pointed out that these
articles give the President the
authority to execute laws
passed by the Congress.

He explained that only in the
same sense of the word that
state executes a criminal could
the President be considered to
be executing an act of Congress
when he refuses to spend ap-
propriated funds.

Ervin then moved on to at-
tack Nixon's defense of im-
poundment on the grounds that
Congress has been financially
irresponsible.

Ervin agreed that for at least
the past forty years. Congress
has been relying far too heavily
on deficit spending.

He also said however. “The
presdents in this same period
have been recommendig
programs which could be finan-
ced only by borrowed money.”

I have always maintained
that if Congress is going to ap-
propriate money that Congress
should be able to levy sufficient
taxes to cover the money ap-
propriated, or cut its ex-
penditures so that it would be
able to take care of it with the
resources at hand.’ Ervin
elaborated.

Ervin explained that there
are programs which he would
like to see eliminated or
reduced. but that he does not
favor using the “meat axe” ap-
proach.

Ervin has proposed a_ bill
which he feels will resolve the
impoundment problem by con-
stitutional means.

“This bill says that when the
President impounds funds that
the impoundment is null and
void unless Congress approves
it within 60 days.” Ervin
said. “This in effect gives the
President an item veto.” Ervin
elaborated.

Ervin’s bill also includes a
clause which would allow the
President to ask the Congress to
reduce or reconsider specitic
portions of an appropriations
bill

Ervin pointed out that a law
such as this would have to ad-
ded benefit of allowing the cour-

ts to decide on the con-
stitutionality of the issue.
In summation, Ervin

reclarified the total disruption
of the system of checks and
balances.

“The question is,’ said Ervin,
“whether the republican form
of government will survive. “If
America cannot keep the
republic which our founding
fathers provided for us, then we
will have a government of men
rather than a government of
laws and we will lose our most
precious possesion,  con-
stitutional, grovernment,
Ervin concluded.

At the end of the speech. Sen.
Ervin fielded questions from
the audience. In response to one
question, Ervin explained how
the Congress has the authority
to grant to the President the
authority to impound = funds,
which is what Ervin’'s bill would
do, although reserving the right
of approval for Congress.

Sen. Sam Ervin Jr

Ervin said, ‘This authority is

found in the ‘necessary and
proper’ clause of the Con-
stitution which says that

Congress can pass all laws
which are necessary or proper
to implement the provisions of
the Constitution.

“Since Congress is concerned
with the financial affairs of the
country. it has the right and the
authority to pass this bill which
I have introduced."

In another field of con-
stitutional conflict. Sen. Ervin
was asked if he knew of any
legal basis for the continued
bombing in Southeast Asia.

Ervin replied, ‘I felt from my
study that the Gulf of Tonkin
resolution...was tantamount to
a declaration of war. After the
Tonkin resolution was repealed.
I felt that the president could
use armed forces to protect the
withdrawal.”

“Tcan frankly state that lam
somewhat at a loss to explain
what authority we have to
engage in. bombing over there
now.” Ervin responded.
