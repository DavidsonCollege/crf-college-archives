‘The R. O. ‘T. C. has proved one of
the easiest tickets in the curriculum so
far.

Cheer up! Only 116 more days till
Commencement !

It is easy to assume a habit; but when
you try to cast it off, it will take skin
and all —J. B.

Have you thought of some suitable
memorial to set up on the campus for
the Davidson men who have fallen’ in
the service?

Announcement by the Faculty that
there will be no Senior Speaking this
year received with thirty-two profound
sighs of, relief.

Now let's ALL get behind the Varsity
and back it thru a victorious spring of
basketball.

Do you stand positively or negatively
for improvement for Diividson ?

Fellows, let’s show a little more con-
sideration for the operators at the “Y"
movies. They're doing their best, and
can't help it when a film breaks. ‘They're
helping: out as a consideration; it’s a
cinch they’re not doing it for their
health! The shows are improving all
the time, as the men become more fa-
miliar with the machine, so let’s cut out
the growling at the operators. Remem-
ber, it's a free show anyway.

FOR OR AGAINST IT?

In the Scriptures it is said that he that
is not “for” is “against.” that “luke-
warmmness” is the same as opposition. We
do not believe that it is objectionable to
quote this passage as regards religious
and secular matters on a college campus,
as it is done with all reverence, and for
a good cause.

That attitude of indifference or su-
perior amusement which some college
men hold toivard many of the campus
activities, may seem to some. perfectly
harmless, but have you ever thot over it
a moment, and considered just what ef-

Ihe DAVIDSONIAN, January 29, 1919

fect such an attitude may have? Do you
know fellows whé never pretend to offer
any support or assistance, but cynically
look on, always ready to offer criticism,
but never furnishing suggestions — or
friendly advice? “They want to get the
benefit or amusement from everything.
but never want to help, and are the first
ones to do the knocking. ‘’Phis ‘thing
is run rotten” and “that. thing isn't
worth a cent”—while all the time some
fellows are plugging away trying to
“make “this thing” and “that thing” a
success. How can they, when there are
deadbeats who kick instead of push? Did
you ever ask yourself why some men try
to hold down “thankless’ jobs? “Fhere’s
ne compensation or honar atached to
them, yet there's lots of work.

There isn't a year but what there are
some fellows who hold such an attitude
of indifferent. cynicism toward the Lit-
erary Societies, the Publications, the Y.
M. C. A. and other activities, and in
some cases even Athletics. Do you think
such a spirit shows loyalty, sportsman-
ship, or courtesy?

NOTICE TO ALUMNI.

A number of the alumni have sug-
gested that The Davidsonian carry a
larger and more interesting alurini de-
partment, which we know is a splendid
idea. But without the co-operation of
alumni we will nor be able to get suffi-
cient news to make this possible. So we
wish te make an appeal to all old David-
son men who would like to hear of the
doings of their college mates: please send
in to The Davidsonian all interesting
items and news of alumni you may fay
your hands on. She Davidsotian has
that as one of its objects: to keep the
alumni in touch with one another. Se
if some old Davidson man changes. his
address, or marries, or gains some honor

“or prominence, .or does something else

worthy of note: please let us know about
it. Help us make this alumni department
a success.

‘TED SULLIVAN 1S HEARD
ON THE NATIONAL GAME

Ted Sullivan, “Father of Baseball.”
and the man who knows more baseball
than any other man in the world, was
an unexpected and very interesting vis-
itor on the campus Monday night.

He brought with him a number of
stereoptican slides with which he traced
the development of this national game
from its infancy. He impressed upon
his audience that although there was a
national are in’ playing the game, the
secret of why so many of the players of
world-wide fame reach such heights, is
clean living, and observing the hws of
nature,

The main feature of the evening wars
the illustrated lecture of the New York

Giants’ and Chicago White Sox's trip

around the world in 1914.

Ted Sullivan was one of the chief
promoters of this trip and told many in-
teresting incidents connected with the
trip. On one occasion, he said that
Lord Kitchener turned to him, after see-
ing the grace and skill with which the
American youth played the game, and
said: “Mr. Sullivan, it seems to me that
a nation with such manhood as this could
never be defeated in war with another
country.” 1 replied: “You are right,
Lord Kitchener, we will not be defeat-
ed." Many humorous incidents occur-
ring in England were also related. At
one time Mr. Sullivan was asked how
the “snake ball” was thrown. Mr. Sulli-
van, not missing a chance to have some
fun, replied that the man who threw the
ball had been bitten by a snake in his
childhood days and some of the wiggle
remained in his arm. This story was
taken in all seriousness and appeared in
English papers the next day.

Mr. Sullivan's lecture was thoroly en-
joyer by the student body and his kind-
ness in visiting Davidson is appreciated.

LET ‘THERE BE LIGHTS.

Davidson learned many new things
under the direction of Uncle Sam. Not
the least of these was the fact that elec-
tric lights in the dormitory halls not
only increased the comfort of the in-
mates but also added to the pleasing ap-
pearance of the campus. Formerly the
hall wires’ and sockets have been used
exclusively as dust gatherers and targets
for baseball artists while the weary stu-
dent stumbled blindly up the stairs.

Since the spring term began Mr, Jack-
son has decided to again fill these sock-
ets, and now every hall is brightly light-
ed. ‘The fate of these light globes rests
with the common sense of the student
body. What is going to be their fate?
Will they mysteriously disappear to
swell sume honorless  fellow’s miscel-
lancous collection? Will they. be used. as
a reserve supply for fellows who are
careless with their own lights? Already
some of these globes have disappeared.
Let's stop it.

‘There are several reasons why every
hall light should be kept burning in its
proper socket.

The comfort and “mobility” of the
entire student body is materially — in-
creased.

In case of fire the first thing to be
done would be to switch on the current.
“This means of safety and of preventing
a stampede is absolutely useless without
globes in the halls. .

The attractiveness of the campus. is,
noticeably increased both for students
and visitors,

And finally, every globe that disap-
pears from the halls is replaced out of
our own pockets. In a few days those
who “watched their steps” last year will
be receiving a refund on the Damage
Fee. If hall lights disappear there will
be no refund at the end of the year.

Let's do our part towards making
Davidson beautiful and towards conserv-
ing the “pin money” of the other fellow.

THE BIRTH OF BASKETBALL.

Basketball's twenty-seventh birthday
finds the game flourishing as never be-
fore, and crowding baseball and track
athletics for popular favor. It was over
a quarter of a century ago, namely,-Jan-
uary 15, 1892, that the first match game
of basketball was played, in Springfield.
Mass.. between two class teams of the
Y. M,C. A. training school. “The sport
was invented by Dr. J. A. Naismith.
then of the Springfield institution, but
now of the University of Kansas. It is
estimated that at least a quarter of a
million persons are playing basketball

as members of regular club.. and the
sport has spread all over the United
States and Canada. and to Europe.

South Africa and the Far East. In the
early days of the game there were as
manv as twenty men on.a side, but since
1896 there have heen five to a team.
The rules have been standardized of
late years, and basketball. in its im-
proved form, has become the great
American game.
