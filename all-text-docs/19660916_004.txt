YMCA Fre

shman Camp

Rated As Successful

More than 180 freshmen ar-
rived on campus two days be-
fore the actual beg‘oning of ori-
entation to attend the YMCA
Freshman Camp, hailed as a
“complete success’’ by director
Don Carroll.

Dr. Harry Smith. a Presby-
terian minister for students at
the University of North Carolina
at Chapel Hill, was the fea-
tured speaker both Tuesday and‘
Wednesday nights. September 6
and 7. He spoke on the problem
of “Apathy and Indifference”
among college students, and his
talk was supplemented by
film concerning the same prob-
lem.

The second night he explained
what the Christian faith has to

H. Terry, chaplain; Don Carroll,
camp director; Bobby Lane,
program chairman: Bobby Vagt,
business manager;
Hawk, publicity chairman. Stu-
dent leaders filled the remaining
positions on the staff.

The location at Camp Thto-
derbird, south of Charlotte in
South Carolina, was easily able
to accommodate the largest num-

CHAPEL ATTRACTIONS

and Chris

ber of freshmen to attend in the
history of the camp. “The facil-
itfes were just ideal,’ said Car-
roll.

Hawk summed up the general
opinion by saying, “It was a
leisurely introduction to David-
son life, with everything well-
plarned and well-timed. This
was-probably the most success-
ful camp yet.”

He pointed out the three proto-

Education.”

GERMAN PRESENTS BOOKS

President D. Grier Martin accepts one of @
collection of books presented to Davidson by
the West German government. Making the
presentation is Dr. Heinrich Pohris, the Ger-
man consul in Atlanta, Ga. The German gov-

ernment has become interested in Davidson's
German year-abroad program a! the Univer-
sity of Marburg; the books symbolize the
mutual interest between Davidson and Ger-
many. (Staff Photo by Olson)

Fees

two alternatives:

1. Charging on a per piece ba-
sis and providing a coin-operat-
ed washerette at an estimated
cost t. each student of $150 per
year.

2. Continuing the old method
and increasing the laundry fee.

“Actuaiy,”” Currie said, “the
college is stuck in the laundry
business because there {s no one
else around here to offer the
service to our students. We're
not try:ng to make a profit with

. the laundry. We just want to
provide the service and break

even—and th.s new fee increase
was necessary for us to break
even.”

Currie anticipates further in
creases in the fee. “The labor
situation is not as critical now
as it will probably be in a couple

of years. This fact, along with.

the possibility of the extension
of federal minimum wage laws
to the laundry business (now
only covered by -state law),
makes further increases a real
likel’hood.

‘In the meant:me.”’ he con-
cluded, ‘we'll be try:ng to re-
tain all our essential services
and p2rsonnel wh.le k2ep:ng the
cost to students as low as pos-
sibie.”

I now consider more important

Both squelched possible re-
cons:deration. “No, definitely
not,” said Clifton.

Hatcher, however, sald only,
“I'm not going to play basket-
ball.” He said ‘nothing special*’
prompted his decision and ad-

mitted that he could change his/

mind ‘any time, especially with
co!d weather."

Hall Counselors Get
$70 Raise In Salary

Requests by the 1966-67 hall
counselors for increased remu-
neration have resulted in a $220-
per-semester salary, the equiva-
lent of full room rent. Only a
request for $10 per semester
above room rent to be paid to
second year ‘counselors was de-
nied.

In a petition submitted to Dean
of Students Richard C. Burts on
May 4, the 1966-67 hall counse-
lors outlined five specific re-
quests. In response to the first
request, the hall counselors will

The hall counselors’ second re-

‘| quest was for the establishment

of a liaison committee between
the hall counselors and the of-
fices of the Supervisor of Dor-
mitories and of the Dean of Stu-
dents. A five-man Hall Coun.
selor Planning Committee has
been created for this task. Mem-
bers are Gary DeVane, chair-
man, Barry St. Clair, Cecil Clif-
ton. Marvin Sparrow, and Tom
Trons.

It has also been agreed that
second-year hall counselors
should be on a committee to
choose new hall connselors and

mitted twice during the year.
The first report is to be com-
pleted by the November meet-
ing of the counselors.

Only the final request concern-
ing financial remuneration was
not completely acceptable with
the administration. According to
Mrs. Nicholls, supervisor of dor-
mitories, whose office is now
in charge of the Hall Counselor
Program, “We need to get it
(the hall counselor program) on
a more business-like basis. We
are saying that this job is worth
a certain amount of money.”

In the past, hall counselors
have been paid according to a
certain proportion of their room
