Pointing for the all-important Federal (Inspection in early
April, the Cadet Regiment spends its Tuesday afternoons these
days perfecting the details of the parade formation.

the one performed during the an-
nual Federal Inspection. Some six
months and 16,000 man hours are
spent by the Cadets to show the
Inspecting Officers the degree of
proficiency attained on the drill
field.

As is the case with any group
activity, the end result is merely
the product of individual prepara-
tion and group coordination.

Preparation for these parades
actually begins the first hour of
the first drill of the year. Fun-
damentals are taught and _per-
fected. The Honor Platoon, Color
Guard, and Band practice separ-
ately until the time arrives to
coordinate with each other and
the remainder of the regiment.

In the practice parades, team-
work and coordination are the
key words, both vital to success.

The actual parade is an im-
pressive sight. The Battalions,
Honor Platoon, Color Guard, Band
and Regimental Staff take their
proper places. The Band “Sounds
Off” and the Honor Platoon exe-
eutes some of its movements.
After the command is presented
by the Reviewing Officer, he and
the Regimental Commander troop
the lines.

Cadet Officers and the Colors
are presented and the National
Anthem sounds. “Pass in Review”
is ordered by the Regimental
Commander and the entire regi-

“The enlarging of Davidson will
be detrimental to many of her

Bondurant felt that subsidized
athletics in their present form at _
Davidson were good and adequate.
“Extremes in either direction will
produce bad effects.”

The candidate advocated bring-
ing the compulsory religion facet
of Davidson life up-to-date through
a thorough investigation of its
worth to students. He felt the
need for volunteer Vesper serv-
ices, while maintaining the pres-

“T was tremendously impressed,’ says
Nick, “by my first plant tour. When
you go through the facilities—meet
the men and get an idea of the prob-
lems they handle—you can’t help but
become interested. Add the friendly,
informal work atmosphere, and you
know right off the bat these people
have a story to tell.’’

Nick came to IBM in 1961 with a
B.S. in physics. He started as a Tech-
nical Engineer—in Test Equipment
Engineering—working on an analog
bombing system. When that project
moved from the Endicott to the
Poughkeepsie plant, Nick followed it,
becoming first an Associate Engineer,
then a Project Engineer. As the lat-

ter, he worked on IBM's first transis-
torized electronic computer—the 608.

By November, '65, Nick was head-
ing up Quality Engineering in the
Quality Control Division of the
Poughkeepsie plant. Recently pro-
moted to Administrative Assistant to
the Quality Control manager, Nick
now concerns himeelf with the funda-
mental operations and policies of this
460-man division. Quality Control is
responsible for the performance of
IBM’s vast array of business ma-
chines—from simple sorters and
punches to the “electronic brains.”’

What an 18M physicist does

“The problems of Quality Control
in this business are endless,’’ ‘Nick
reports, “and fascinating to the phys-

“What's it like to be
A PHYSICIST AT IBM?"

Five years ago, college senior Nick Hemmer asked himeelf this question.
Today, as Administrative Assistant to the Quolity Control manager, Nick
teviews his experience at IBM and gives some pointers that may be helpful
to you in taking the first, most important step in your career as a physicist.

of metals, such as the resistivity of
germanium. Then, there are the im-
portant ‘analysis of failure’ and

to determine, for example, the ‘life

expectancy’ of a device, the mean
time between failures, or perhaps
which step in a process has the great-
est effect on the equipment involved.
You may be asked to control the
deposit of glass on X-ray tubes to
avoid spill-over, or microscopic spot-
ting. Or you may be dealing with
arc-suppression, or gaseous electron-
ics, the grass roots of instrumentation;
or in the estimation of tolerances, or

in correlation coefficients—that is,
in physically sound numbers.”’

Nick has been instrumental in
encouraging many college physics
majors to come to IBM. “I find

they’re interested in questions like

these,’”” he says: “How would you go
about determining the ‘life’ of elec-
trons in transition from the valence
to the conduction band?” Or, in the
manufacture of magnetic inks, “How
can the grain size of the iron content
be controlled . .. or its viscosity regu-
lated over wide temperature ranges?
How would you contrd! the concen-

tration and concentricity of colloidal
solutions?” “Present a job in terms
of actual problems,” believes Nick,
“and you'll get the man’s interest
for it’s his career and his future that
have top priority.”

How obout further study?

Nick has taken full advantage of
IBM’s extensive educational facilities
to get ahead at IBM. He took at least
one course each semester on subjects
within his immediate work area—
courses on digital and analog com-
puters and on their components such
as cores and transistors. He found
time to take management courses as
well. “If you want opportunity for
study,” Nick says, “IBM will provide
all you want.””

Promotion almes? inevitable

Asked about opportunities for ad-
vancement at IBM, Nick says, ‘‘The
situation could hardly be better in
that respect. With sales doubling
every five years on the average, pro-
motion is almost inevitable.”

IBM hopes that this message will help to
give you some idea of what it’s like to be
a physicist at IBM. There are equal op-
portunities for E.E.'s, M.E.’s, mathema-
ticians and Liberal Arts majors in IBM’s
many divisions—Research, Manufavtur-
ing Engineering, Sales and Technical
Services. Why not drop in and discuss
IBM with your Placement Director? He
can supply our latest brochure and tell
you when IBM will next interview on
your campus. Meanwhile, our Manager
of Engineering Recruitment, Mr. R. A.
Whitehorne, will be happy to answer your
