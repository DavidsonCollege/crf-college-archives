David Lean started direc-
ting films in the early 1940's,

he stuck to relatively modest
undertakings such as adapta-
tions of Noel Coward (Blithe
Spirit, Brief Encounter), and
Charles Dickens (Great Ex- dom.
pectations, Oliver Twist).
Then in 1957 he turned to
large-scale spectaculars like
The Bridge on the River Kwai.
Lean’s second of such films
was Lawrence of Arabia, this
week’s Pop Film presentation.
The film is about T.E.Law-
rence, a British writer and
adventurer who, through no
small effort of his own, became
something of a legend. He was
first attracted to the Middle
East as an archaeologist, and
went there shortly before
World War I.
During the war he became

involved in the Arabians’ fight
for independence from the
Turks (who were allies of
Germany and the enemies of
England). He returned to
Arabia several times after the
for about a decade and a half war, and embarked on a
writing career which included
a translation of The Odyssey,
and an autobiographical epic
called Seven Pillars of Wis-

Lawrence of Arabia was filmed
by Lean in the Middle East at
a cost upwards of $11 million.
The screenplay was by Robert
Bolt, who also collaborated
with Lean on his later epics,
Doctor Zhivago and Ryan’s
Daughter.

Peter O'Toole plays the title
role in his first major film; the
supporting cast includes
Anthony Quinn, Alec Gui-
ness, Jose Ferrer, and Omar
Sharif. The film won seven
Academy Awards including
Best Picture, Best Director,
and Best Cinematography.

SENATOR WILLIAM FULBRIGHT will speak at David-

Twenty percent of faculty hired in unanticipated return to Davidson

By ANN GARNER
Staff Writer

Twenty percent of the Davidson
College faculty were once under-
graduates here. Unsure whether cries
of inbreeding or signs of idealism
should spring forth.upon realization
of this curiosity, one should perhaps
take refuge in one question:

Just what is it that these professors
see in Davidson that lures them back
to the place of their halcyon under-
graduate days?

“T was drafted,’ said Herb Jack-
son, ‘‘to fill a temporary gap in the
department. I guess I came back
because I had been to Davidson and
knew that there was a lot that could
be done with art here.’’

“‘T suppose the basic thing was that

there is more freedom, intellectual
freedom, than anywhere else. I also
knew and understood the student-
faculty relations and religious com-
mitment,” stated Dr. J.H. Ostwalt.

Dr. Joseph Drake echoed these
sentiments: ‘““The emphasis here is on
minimum research and maximum
teaching. There is little pressure but
encouragement to produce articles
done on your own initiative and on
your own time.”

Most, who return had never consi-
dered coming back to Davidson.
“They came looking for me,” says Dr.
Locke White, Jr. in summarizing the
general trend among those who
returned.

“You know your way around,’’ said
Dr. Hansford Epes. ‘‘Yet although

i’m not sorry for having come back,
there is a disadvantage in not having
diversity of educational experiences
and institutions.”

This “‘inbreeding”’ or lack of diver-
sity was the subject of criticism by
the Southern Association Visiting
committee in 1965-66. ‘‘Fifteen to
twenty years ago, the percentage was
over forty percent,’’ said Frontis
Johnson, Vice President of Academic
Affairs.

“This criticism stems from a feeling
that some, though not the majority,
are hesitant to change, the older
alumni being sentimentally opposed.’’

“Perhaps having been to Davidson
makes some decisions harder. For
example in the doing away with the
fraternity system which was a

D.C. POP

meaningful part of my college life,”’
said Dr. M.B.Stroud. ‘‘Even if the
change is for the better, the way we
did things has some merit.”’

‘‘Dr. Thomas Clark expressed a
similar conflict in decision, “I have a
confession. I was one of the very
small percentage who voted against
the coeds. Because of the tradition,
because of the past. I just couldn’t
imagine girls here. Yet it has not
made any difference, in fact ,:coeds
have added: more excitement to
classes.”’

‘‘T really don’t think it has any-
thing to do with where you gradu-
ate,” contradicted Dr. Joseph Drake.
“You get used to something, like it
that way, and havea hard time seeing
the value of change.”’

Yet with the demise of the frater-
nity system as it was and the
abolishment of compulsory vespers, a
majority of professors have noticed a
decrease in friendliness among stu-
dents.

“We never get together anymore,”’
said Dr. Charles Ratliff. ‘‘And there is
a loss of the small community of
friendliness. It was an unwritten rule
when I was a student, we never met
anyone without speaking.”

Dr. Locke White voiced a similar
opinion: “Compulsory vespers and
chapel were the common. experience
among students that is just not
present now. Asaresult, thereisa
marked difference in the community
feeling at Davidson.”
