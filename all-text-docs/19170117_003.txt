The DAVIDSONIAN, January 17, 1917

With the Alumni

The following from “The Charlotte
Observer” of recent date should be of
interest both to present and former
students:

“Fishburne Military Academy, at
Waynesboro, Va., is claiming the Vir-
ginia preparatory foot ball champion-
ship. The team has a splendid claim,
too, with seven victories and no defeats.
The team during the past Fall has been
coached by Pete Crayton, of Charlotte.
former Davidson star and one of the
hardest working and most inspiring
coaches that the Red and Black has de-
veloped in recent years. It is stated
that Fishburne is the only preparatory
school in the State who has not suffered
a defeat this Fall, and upon this record
the claim is justified.”

In a competitive examination given
by the Board of Examiners of. the
United States Naval Academy, Mr. J.
W. Pratt, associate professor of English
in A. & M. College, Raleigh, N. C., ob-
tained the most satisfactory grade and
has been appointed to an instructorship
in the English department of the Naval
Academy.

Mr. Pratt graduated from Davidson
in 1908. He has been connected with
the English department of A. & M. for
three years, and by this appointment the
institution loses a valuable man. Mr.
Pratt will begin his duties at the Naval
Academy about October ist. Mr.
Pratt’s former home was at Marion.

GOT THE WRONG PERSON.

In no other household except that of
a doctor could this mistake so plausibly
have occurred. -

“Get my bag for me at once,” boom-
ed the doctor, “some fellow says in a
dying voice that he can’t live without
me.”

“Just a moment,” interposed his wife.
“TI think that call is for daughter, dear.”
—Louisville Courier-Journal.

TWO ESSENTIAL POINTS.

Friend—What is the first thing you
-do when a man presents himself to you
yor consultation ?

Doctor—I ask him if he has a car.

Friend—What do you learn from
that?

Doctor—If he has one I know he is
wealthy, and if he hasn’t I know he is
healthy. — Puck.

“It only takes me twenty minutes to
get to my office,” said Mr. Chuggins.

‘But you didn’t arrive until an hour
after you telephoned you were leaving

It took me the other forty
minutes to get the car started.”—
‘Washington Star.

LITERARY LARCENY.

Every man who uses the college li-
brary has felt the explosive vexation
that strains his moral safety valve, when
after searching the card index he hap-
pily comes upon the number of the
book he wants, only to find it subscribed
“lost” or “missing.” It is dismaying to
observe how many valuable books are
gone, and how many of the costly li-
brary editions and sets of authors are
broken by the loss of one or more vol-
umes. And where are, these errant
books? They are flown on the diabolic
wings of theft. Does the fault rest with
the library administration? Not alto-
gether, for the librarians must presume
upon honesty in those who have access
to the reference shelves and especially
in those who go among the stacks; and
they are helpless when they must depend
upon honesty that is not.

It is ignominy enough that there
should be students among us who de-
grade themselves to any thievery. It is
infamy unutterable that there should be
scoundrels so base as to steal the books
of our library. For those books are the
property of the students, and larceners
of them become public enemies. Let us
eradicate this unprincipled sect of lit-
erary thieves from our midst by refer-
ring all cases of book-theft to the Honor
Committee, whose duty is to deal with
such matters, and by demanding that the

committee shall take effective penal
action.— Wake: Forest.
SIGNALS.

In addition to the familiar ‘Stop
Look and Listen” signs, erected at cross-
ings of its lines and public highwavs.
the Southern Railway plans to install
approach warning signs on the highways
300 feet away from the tracks. Per-
mission will be asked of county authori-
ties as such signs will be placed beyond
the railway’s right of way.

It is planned to place the signs on
the right side of the highway, approach-
ing crossings, in the hope that they will
attract the attention of , automobile
drivers while they still have ample dis-
tance in which to stop. Experience ha
shown that automobiles are driven se
swiftly on the public highwavs that fre-
quently their drivers fail to bring them
under control after thev see the cus
tomary sign on the railway's right of
way.

The approach signs will consist of
the letters “R. R.” and a cross painted
boldly in black on a white field on cast
iron disks 24 inches in diameter, mount
ed on pedestals nine, feet high, being in
accordance with standards adopted by
the American Railwav Association.

Several months will- be required for
placing these signs throughout the terri-
tory served by the Southern Railway.
but in the meantime county officers will
be requested to grant the necessary per-
mission.

Dr. Edward Mack. a distinguished
alumnus of Davidson, now a professor at
the Seminary at Richmond, was in town
last week. He is the father of Joe
Mack, ‘19.

“Bang!” went the rifles at the maneu-
vres. Oo-oo!” screamed the pretty girl
—a nice, decorous, surprised little
scream. She stepped backwards into the
arms of a young man.

“Oh!” said she. blushing, “I was
frightened by the rifles. I beg your par-
don.”

“Not at all,” said the young man.
“Let's go over and watch the artillery.”
—Pickings.

Dr. D—In how many states does
matter exist ?

Freshman (waiting a moment )—A—
I do—Oh! Forty-eight.

KILL FISH SOON AS CAUGHT.

It is not only more human, but it
yields a better food value if fish are
killed as soon as they are taken from
the water. This may be done by a quick
blow on the head or by pushing the head
back to break the neck. It is a mistake
to let the fish flop about in the bottom
of the boat or lie gasping in the creel.

The fisherman should then “bleed”
the fish by running the knife blade
around the bottom of the gills. This
brings the fish home, ready for the cook-
ing pan, in the best possible condition.

Says a veteran angler who is an ex-
pert in more arts than the single one of
pulling bass and trout from the water,
“In order to get your fish home without
any discoloration take along a yard o1
two of white cheese cloth, As soon as
the fish is caught, kill it and bleed it.
Then dampen the cloth and wrap up
each fish separately, taking care that no
two fish touch each other. Bv doing
this you will find that all the color
markings on the fish will remain just
as clear and bright as when taken from
the water, and the fish will be sweet and
palatable.” — Fx.

FIRE EXTINGUISHER.

According to an American technical
journal, aqua ammonia—i. e., the com-
mon liquid ammonia to be obtained at
the oil shops—forms a most efficient
fire extinguisher, and several instances
are given of its power to arrest incipient
conflagration. In one case the vapour
from a tank of benvoline caught fire in
a laundry, the room being filled with
flame. The fire was at once annihilated
by throwing into the room a bottle con-
taining a gallon and a half of ammonia,
procured from a chemist’s shop which
happily was situated next door. The
chemist, in reporting the matter, stated
that the effect was instantaneous, the
flames giving place to torrents of black
smoke, and in a moment every trace of
fire was gone. The most surprising
feature of the occurrence is that the
tank of benzoline remained intact, al-
though the vapour from it was the
initial cause of the outbreak.
