WORK, SACRIFICE, AND A LITTLE BLOOD
Pete Stavrides instructs one of his pupils in Shorin-
Ryu karate.

Coach Tom Stevens named
senior Wade Shepherd and

Junior Rick Pipan as the pro-

bable pitchers for the Wild-
cats. The team is tied for
fifth in the conference with
E.C.U. going into these final
two games.

Coach Stevens | attributed
the slump to an occasional
lapse in the field and, most
importantly, a 20 pont drop
in the team. batting average,
meaning the team is failing
to get crucial hits it was
getting earlier in the year.

Rick Pipan, the team's
junior hurler, has continued
to pitch well but the runs
have been lacking. He has
lost five of his last seven
decisions.

Among these are included
a 2-1 loss in twelve innings
at William and Mary, a 2-0
loss last Saturday against
The Citadel, and a 3-2 game
Tuesday to Furman.

Stevens also said the team
dropped three. straight to
Duke because of errors.

Stevens could not explain
why the slump has lasted so
long except'to say, ‘It's just
one of those mental things.
The boys seem to be begin-
ning to press too hard now.”

The slump has wiped out
hopes for a top spot’ in the
Southern Conference, for
which’ ’the ’Cats still had a
great chance until last Satur-
day. They were 6-4, but the
double losses at the hands
of Furman. and The Citadel
did them in.

Stavrides Leads Group
In Practice Of Karate

By A. W. TURNER
Asst. Sports Editor

Every week, fifteen people
practice the Shorin-Ryu Oki-
‘nawan style at Johnson Gym,
which has become the dojo.

No, no subversive activity
is going on. Pete Stavrides, a
sophomore from Long Island
and a Black Belt, teaches a
karate school (‘‘dojo’’) ‘on the
handball courts as a part of
the Free University program
each week.

The class has been taught
for one year, and four stu-
dents have already complet-
ed their requirements for
green belts.

Two Thinclads
Place At Duke

Two Davidson thinclads
placed in the North Carolina
state track meet held at
Duke University in oe
last weekend.

Steve Kirley took a third
place in the shot put compe-
tition.

Ray Swetenburg placed ip

two events, taking a third in
{he triple jump and a fifth
in the high hurdles.

According to track coach
Sterling Martin, Sweten-
burg’s qualifying time was
among the best of the meet,
but he did not fair as well
in the competition.

Robert Camp, Bil) Alex-

ander, Mike Ernst, and Da-

vid Meeks have. now achiev-
ed that wank and merely
await the arrival of the belts.

Camp and Alexander will
teach the karate class next
year when. Stavrides is study-
ing in France.

Stavrides has five David-
son students and ten towns-
people in his class. At each
meeting they go through
strenuous exercises ‘and a
disciplined format.

Stavrides is a traditionalist
who believes in teaching the
class just as it has been
taught for centuries, main-
taining ‘the spiritual, philo-
sophical and aesthetic valies
that go with such’ a format.

Stavrides said the primary
purpose of karate was to de-
velop a rigorously maintain-

ed harmony of mind and
body.
Stavrides teaches the

course on a completely vol-
untary basis. He gave two
re:sons for offering the class.

‘First,’ he said, ‘I want
to try to stay in the best
shape I possibly can. And
second, I feel that a grow-
ing, progressing school such
as Davidson should _ offer
some martial arts program.”

He noted two controversies
over the teaching of karate
today. First, he pointed to the
traditionalism versus the

commercialism argument.
“Some think karate should
be only a sport without the

spiritual, philosophical and
desthetic values which ac-
company it,’ Stavrides stat-

ed. He teaches his students
in the disciplined traditional
manner.

He also noted the controver-
Sy over whether to “pull the
punches" iin ta class or not.
Stavrides does not believe in
“holding back,” reasoning
that when one really has to
defend himself in the street,
he may ‘pull his punch” as
he has in practice rather
than exert 100 per cent as he
should.

However, apparently Stav-
rides’ studenis do not greatly
object.to his uncompromising
pressure and rigorous dis-
cipliné. Rather, he’ said, ‘‘it
has créated a devotion to
perfection of the art.”’

Occasionally, a student
does. get: discouraged. and
wonders if it is all really
worth it. When that occurs,
Stavrides tells the student
what his own “sen sei”
(teacher), Joseph Johnston,
told him when he first be
gan six years ago.

“He told us that nothing
in life that “is worthwhile
comes easily,” Stavrides re-
called. ‘‘Everything good in

life is gained through hard |
work, sacrifice, and perhaps

some blood.”
