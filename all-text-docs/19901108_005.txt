Gantt Article Devoid of Truth

To the Editor:

Reading Tom Koonce’s
article this week “Support
for Gantt Visible on Cam-
pus” reminds one of the old
adage : “You can fool all of
the people all of the time-but
only if they’re stupid.” For
a journal that prides itself on
fair and objective journal-
ism, it is surprising ‘to: see
that the lead article on the
front page would be so one-
sided and devoid of truth.
We take exception to his

_assertion that Helms sup-
porters are politically inert.

In fact, nothing could be
farther from the truth. Our
confidence in Senator
Helm’s integrity and the
likelihood of his election
make it unnecessary for us
to demonstrate and agitate
in a vain attempt to sway
North Carolina’s “real” vot-
ers. Davidson’s ivory tower
of liberal intelligentsia no
more accurately represents
the real attitude of the nor-
mal ‘North Carolina voter
than does two dollar bottle
of Evian represent what they

Asserting that we har-
bor antipathy towards our
candidate is like suggesting
that a journalist should pres-
ent his or her biased opin-
ions in the guise of fact. Mr.

Koonce certainly may be a
liberal voter, but he is not
less liberal in the misuse of
the truth. The truth is that as
supporters of Senator Helms
and his strong policy on the
environment, we have re-
frained from putting up many
and sundry posters. After
the election is over Mr.
Gantt’s posters will be noth-
ing more than landfill space,
something we will truly
regret. And the Davidson
Students for Harvey Gantt?
They have slipped “flyers
under student doors on
campus, provided'*bumper
stickers for the faculty and
most recently sent letters to
the parents of every North
Carolina: student” at
Davidson. Noble indeed, but
what of those poor innocent
sequoias? And how many
rainforests destroyed to

make Mr. Gantt a senator?
Do these students some-
how believe that hundreds
of posters and flyers. will
convince the voters of North
Carolina that Mr. Gantt
won’t raise their taxes or
y? Cer-

tor Helms is unbeaten.
Surely, the persistent Mr.
Gantt has had many worth-
while endeavors in the past,
having been narrowly de-
feated by Sue Myrick(the
most personable woman in
Charlotte) for Mayor and
having almost established a
minority television station
in North Carolina, at ahand-
some profit.(We'd like to
acknowledge that the idea
for the previous sentence was
derived from the character
of the brave Sir Robin in
‘Monty Python’s “Holy
Grail’).

When it boils down to
election day(already passed
to be sure) we are confident
that the overwhelming su-
periority of Senator Helms
on such issues as apple pie,
motherhood, and commu-
nists will secure his victory.
But if the worst should hap-
pen, and Senator Helms
should return to pursue his
retirement in conservative
bliss, we take heart in the
even older adage “You de-
serve what you get.”

tainly Mr. Gantt and his
supporters are not lacking in
enthusiasm, but the bottom
line amounts to the majority
of the votes on election day,
and in that department Sena-

Sincerely,
