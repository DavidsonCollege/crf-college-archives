Charles Pratt

Elected

To Editorship of Annual
For 1930 Publication

Prominent Junior Elected in Final
Balloting Over McGavock

ACTIVE IN LITERARY WORK

Dubose and Anderson Eliminated
in Preliminary Elections Held
Monday and Tuesday—Staff

Not Selected

Quips and Cranks, yearbook for the
student body, will be edited next year
by Charles M. Pratt, of Louisville, Ky.
Pratt was elected to the office of editor
by his classmates after three mornings
of spirited balloting. On the final bal-
lot cast Tuesday Pratt led W. G. Me-
Gavock, of Franklin, Tenn., by a mar-
gin sufficient for election.

Four men were nominated the
present staff of Quips and Cranks for
the position of editor. These were:
C. H. Dubose, D. P. Anderson, W. G.
McGavock, and Pratt. All have work-
ed faithfully in the duties of the an-
nual staff during the past two years.
The first ballot found Dubose .elim-
inated. On the second vote Anderson
was dropped, and Pratt and McGa
vock were left to fight it out.

The new editor is well fitted to car-
ry on the task of issuing a high type of
college annual. He has been interested
in every phase of literary work on the
campus, and has become a member of
Sigma Upsilon, national literary fra-
ternity. Pratt was nominated for edi-
tor of The Davidsonian, having served
that publication in the capacity
managing editor. He is also a member
of Delta Pi Kappa, journalistic fra-
ternity. Phi Delta Theta is the social
fraternity-to which Pratt belongs. His
staff will be announced after the
Easter holidays.

McGavock has served in the
city of contributing editor on the Quips
and Cranks staff for the past vear and
has been prominent in student affairs
generally. He is a member of the
track squad. His fraternity is Kap-
pa Alpha. Anderson has been to the
forefront in serving student publica-
tions, having been on The Davidson-
ian staff as well as that of the annual.
He a member Theta Upsilon
Omega. Dubose has been connected
with numerous student activities in-
cluding the glee club, The Davidson-
ian, and many others.

The Ministry

The following message to Davidson
students expecting to enter the min-
istry was written by the Rev. Mark
A. Matthews, D.D., pastor of the
largest Presbyterian Church, in point
of membership, in the United States,
the First Presbyterian Church, Seattle,
Washington, especially for publication
in The Davidsonian:

To Young Ministers

No young man should call himself into
the ministry. Ministers are not self-ap-
pointed, nor are they self-starters. No
one should ever enter the ministry except
in answer to the call—the clear and dis-
tinct call—of the Holy Spirit. When men
are humanly selected, or, when they ap-
point themselves to become ministers of
the Gospel they are usually misfits or
they are the church’s great misfortunes.

God’s program for filling the pulpit is
found in the Gospel. Christ said, “Pray
the Lord of the Harvest to send laborers
into the field.” Parents should pray, ask-
ing God to call their sons. Young men
who feel inclined by the Holy Spirit,
should pray, asking God to select them
for the mighty position of a minister. The
minister is supernaturally called, super-
naturally endowed, supernaturally com-
missioned to preach the supernatural Gos-
pel under the terms of the supernatural
commission.

Those who enter the pulpit under any
other conditions are curses, they can never
become blessings. The highest position
on earth is that of the evangelical pulpit.
It is supreme, over all other positions.
It is the supreme point of elevation in
the world. The man who is divinely
called and divinely equipped is impreg-
nable and occupies the most commanding,
the most useful, and the most influential
position on earth. If young men are en-
tering the ministry as an occupation or a
profession in order that they may have

this world’s earthly emoluments, they are
unworthy of such a position, If they, in
to the call of Jesus Christ and
under the leadership of the Holy Spirit,
become ministers, they should enter the
fields of labor in absolute confidence and
demonstrate to the world the greatest
courage and the most fearless zeal that
has ever been manifested.

The minister is not amenable to any-
hody in the world. He is amenable only
to the dictation of the Holy Ghost. Pray
the Lord of the Harvest to call such men.
Every young minister ought to feel the
compelling force of the spirit which made
Paul say, “Woe unto me if I preach not
the Gospel.” If young men feel that same
spirit they should enter the pulpit know-
that there is no power in Hell or earth
that can stop them or defeat them, I
urge young men to wait for the call of
‘the Holy Ghost.

Orators To Close
Junior Speaking

With the staging in Shearer Hall to-
night at 8:30 of the Junior Oratorical
Contest, the 1929 Junior Speaking fes-
tivities wil be brought to a close. What
was originally the main feature of the
Junior Speaking week, and the one
from which the celebration derived its
name, had to be postponed this year
until “the following week because of
the unusual number of attractions
booked.: Four members of the Junior
Class have entered this year’s contest
which is to be the climax of an event-
ful week. They are R. M. Christian,
T. R. Nunan, E E. Marsh, and F. D.
Miller. Each of these men will speak
for ten minutes on any subject which
he desires to select. A committee of
judges will probably be appointed from
among the members ofthe faculty
which will decide the winner of the
contest.

O. D. K. Tap Day

According to a recent
announcement O. D. K. bids will
be extended at the regular “tap
day” exercises about the middle
of April.

Initiation will probably be held
sometime during the same week
in which “Tap Day” is observed.
The speaker for this occasion
has not been definitely decided
upon as yet, although arrange-
ments for one are being made at
present.

The men who receive invita-
tions to membership will be
members of present Junior and
Senior classes who have proved
to be outstanding in one or more

phases of campus activities.

GLEE CLUB MAKES

FIRST SPRING TOUR

Musicians Visit Lincolnton, Shel-

Trips Planned for Rest of
Season

The Glee Club atau Monday night,
March 18th, its first spring tour,
during which, towns in North and South
Carolina were visited.

from

Leaving here Friday afternoon, the
Club travelled in its special te® Lincoln-
ton, where it rendered an impressive con
cert that night. Saturday, the Club went |
to Spartanburg, where, as Lincoln-
ton, the members of the Club were en-
tertained in private homes. After taking

in

dinner Sattirday evening at Converse Col- |

lege, the Club gave its second concert in
the chapel. The Sunday night
service at the First Presbyterian Church
of Spartanburg was almost entirely given
over to the Glee Club and was featured
by instrumental numbers, solos, and num-
bers by the quartet and Club.

On Monday the Glee Club arrived in
Shelby in time to take lunch at the High
School Cafeteria and the last concert on
the trip was given in the Shelby High
School Auditorium. Some thirty-two men
were taken on the trip this time, the
organization having been slightly enlarged
since its last trip. The Jazz Orchestra, of
course, accompanied the Club on its tour.

The quartet was re-organized for this
trip and consisted in the following: First
Tenor, J. C. Bradley; Second Tenor, W.
E. Phifer, Jr.; Baritone, E. Z. DuZose;
Bass, R. R. Kane.

In all probability, the Club will make
several other short tours before the close
of school, as this first tour of the spring
was not long as usual.

his opinion that most of the students
didn't know whether the contents of the
magazine were good or not, and if the
writers thought it good that they should
be allowed to print it. His speech was
popular; he had won his hearers; and
he put a swift motion before the house
that the magazine be continued status quo.

Mr. Dumas, assuming the student body

motion and attempted to call for a show

was challenged and he had to accept the
motion made by Mr. Flinn. There were
