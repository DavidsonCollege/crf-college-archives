18 Year old College Student is a Published Novelist

By Janet Singleton
(CPS) -- If there was a lot of noise
in Lorri Hewett’s dormitory one
| morning last November, she’s the
| one to blame.

She ran down the halls of
Emory University’s Hopkins Hall
‘screaming “I gotpublished!” after
the news came that Holloway
House in Los Angeles, Calif., ac-
cepted her novel “Coming of Age”
for release this summer.

The achievement defies con-
ventional wisdom in the publish-
ing industry.

First of all, college students
don’t getnovels published -- that’s
for seasoned writers, their roads to
success paved by rejection slips.

Secondly, Hewett didn’t have
an agent; she sent her manuscript
by mail. Editors at some publish-
ing houses won’t even talk to au-
thors who don’t»have an agent.
And thirdly, Hewett’s novel was
accepted by the first company she
contacted. Often even agented

manuscripts get passed from one
publishing house to another for a
year before one says yes.

So what happened here? “Per-
severance and luck,” says 18-year-
old Hewett, now a sophomore.

Hewett is no naive literary ro-
mantic. She learned the ropes by
pounding out two other books. The
first was a 100-pager, on pioneers
in the 1800’s, she wrote at age 9.

“I had just finished reading
‘Little House on the Prairie,’ and
wanted to write something just like
it.” At 15, she wrote a novel about
high school racism and submitted
it in pursuit of the Delacorte First
Young Adult Novel Prize. Her
book didn’t win, but the editors
were encouraging.

“They wrote me and said they
thought I had a real future in writ-
ing,” Hewett says.

Noteverything the editors said -

was complimentary, though.
“They said I had a lot of stylistic
problems,” she says. Hewett re-

members she didn’t even know
what style was, but she was going
to find out. So she found a copy
of Strunk and White’s “Elements
of Style.”

By her last year at Chatfield
High School in Littleton, Colo.,
she was ready to give novel-writ-
ing another try. “I was in the sec-
ond semester of my senior year,”
she says. “I was just sitting around
waiting for my life to begin, so I
thought I’d write a book about
people at this point in their lives.”

She wrote the first draft of
“Coming of Age” in longhand in
six weeks. Then she revised iton
her computer.

The book’s three characters
are all black high school seniors
at crossroads in their lives. She
writes of teens who don’t know
whether to embrace their Afri-
can-American identities to the ex-
clusion ofall else or to reject their
heritage altogether. “Identity,”
Hewett says, “is the theme that

runs throughout the book.”

Hewett, whose middle-class
parents brought her up in a pre-
dominantly white suburb, has
things in common with each char-
acter, she says. “There are times I
felt I didn’t know how to fit in. I
wanted to write about young blacks
who were going through what I
was going through.”

Media images stereotyping
African-American teens as drug
dealers or young mothers frustrate
Hewett. So does any brand of
Afro-centrism that sacrifices indi-
vidual uniqueness for strict unity.

“There isn’t one single black
identity,” she says. ‘For every

black person in the country, there’s
a different black experience.

Now that Hewett is at Emory,
she may write about the college
experience. She is working on
another book, but declines to say
much about it Hewett still sees
herself more as a student than a
writer. She doesn’t have any illu-
sions of fleeing Emory, sans di-
ploma, for the writing life.

“Unrealistic,” she says. The
day she received the advance cop-
ics of her book in the mail, she
“was excited for about an
hour.” Then she put her books back
in their box and returned to her
course work.
