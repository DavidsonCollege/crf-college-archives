Are You Serious?

The practice of bickering across the
editorial page is distasteful, and fortu-
nately, little has gone on this year.
But the letter elsewhere on this page
charging misrepresentation. untruth,
incompletion and presumption in last
week's editorial on athletics forces us
to take pen in hand and clarify the
charges against us.

True, last week’s letter was, as the
signers of this week’s epistle acknowl-
edge. concerned with the formula of
dist rtbuting funds from the Living En-
dowment. The only trouble is that this
weck’s signers didn’t take the effort to
read to the end of the letter. “Our ob-
jections go far beyond the insufficien-
cy of financial explanations, though,”
last week's signers said. They went on
to point out numerous objections to a
subsidized program and concluded
that “the operation of such subsidized
athletics is entirely out of line with the
educational purposes of the college.”
It’s difficult to imagine anything more
explicit than that. If only half the sign-
ers want an “end to the practice,” the
other half obviously favor athletics
over the college’s educatonal aims.

The issue of accreditation speaks
for itself. The Southern Association’s
rule says nothing about outside control
of athietics; it says athletics will be
under faculty control — not Athletic
Department, not alumni, not trustees,
but faculty. And the facts of the mat-

ter are that the faculty has control in’

name only. If either the signers or
Dean Frontis Johnston thinks the col-
lege is in complete compliance with
the rule, they’re either misleading
themselves or they haven’t read the
rule.

Recommendations of the Visiting
Committee: “That athletic scholarships
aS administered be abolished.” And
later: “That this (use of athletic grants
made on the basis of athletic ability)
is not a proper use of scholarship
funds for a school of the character of
Davidson College.” The language is
clear and unambiguous; it calls for a
“completely non-subsidized athletic
program,” as last week’s editorial stat-

ed.

Since when is the college’s goal in
intercollegiate athletic competition the
chief criterion for comparing our-

selves with other schools? The pros-.

pect is frightening. The point is that
members of the Visiting Committee
are all respected educators from re-
spected institutions, institutions the
college could do well to study.

Again, this week's signers ignore
the fact that last week’s letter went
beyond protesting the formula used
with the Living Endowment to criti-
cize, the very structure of subsidized
athletics. “Not one word about the
formula,” this week’s letter said. But
what was left to be said? Yes, the
trustees will see the distortions in the
Living Endowment, but they will also
see that subsidized athletics are them-
selves under fire.

Our Public Image

Standard advice for politicians: “Bad
publicity is better than no publicity at
all.” Perhaps. But not for college
newspapers. We could have done with-
out Sunday’s comments by the ebulli-
ent aristocrat of Piedmont sports, Bill
Currie, on “The Lefty Driesell Show.”

Currie’s spicy assessments of col-
lege newspapers (“run by a bunch of
sophomores who want to change the
world’) come as a painful blow to the
juniors and seniors who man our staff.
Can't we take our hand at changing
the world? Or are upperclassmen sup-
posed to have lost their idealism after
their sophomore stint on the staff?

Nice try, Mr. Currie. Dismissing col-

.lege newspapermen as “incompetents

who can’t do anything else’ was a val-
iant enough attempt to belittle those
who haven't yet become satisfied with
armchair assessments of their sur-
roundings.

Turn about ‘is fair play, they say.
But in the interest of keeping peace in
Mecklenburg journalism, we reserve
comment on the competency of local
announcers to assess our professional
standards.

Elections: Inconsistency ....

There’s a right way to get things
done. and there’s a wrong way. Few
would disagree that the student body
election rules are anachronistic and
desperately in need of revision. But
high-handed, arbitrary action by the
Student Council’s Elections Board is
not the way to get the change.

“What's behind these candidates be-
ing allowed to place posters around
campus?” people were asking this
weck, about a practice that contradicts
precedent, though there is no explicit
rule in the Student Council Bylaws for-
bidding such a practice. Most students
are obviously under the impression
that posters are verboten, and when
the chairman of the Elections Board
gave permission, somewhat presump-
tuously, for the candidates to distri
ute posters, he did so under the im-
pression that posters were ordinarily
contrary to the rules.

The board owes it to the student
body in general and the candidates in
particular to clarify this issue—it’s un-
fair for some to have this advantage
and some not.

The special permission given two
candidates this week was granted on
the shaky explanation that they had
no other means of getting their pro-
grams before the people, since THE
DAVIDSONIAN had denied them a
right to publish their platforms. A sim-
ple check with the bylaws again would
have made it clear that provision has
been made for candidates for Union
president to distribute platforms in
the same manner as other candidates
who have not been fortunate enough
to have had their platforms printed in
the paper in preceding years.

And theré would supposedly have
been a similar provision made for the
president of the Social Council, had
the Student Council taken the trouble
to revise their bylaws in the two years
since the Social Council was institut-
ed.

If the Student Council should get.

rid of any restrictions on posters, it
would be taking a step, albeit a minor
one, forward in streamlining the elec-
tions system. But it shouldn't be done
on the specious grounds that this
newspaper has denied them a voice.

Minor distortions of the election
rules are a dime a dozen, as becomes

readily obvious on a casual reading of
the rules, The difference is that most
violations indicate a sloppiness in ad-
ministration; to have the ban on poster
inconsistently enforced puts certain
candidates at a disadvantage.

.... And Anachronism

And speaking of election rules. The
Student Council, acting as guardian of
the student body’s morals, has demon-
Strated its naivete in refusing to mod-
ernize the voting system by removing
the ban on bloc voting.

If council members would take their
heads out of the sand, they would see
that bloc voting goes on in subtle ways
already. Examples of fraternity men
covertly agreeing to swap votes is not
at all unusual. Yet one of the argu-
ments given against the deletion of
that section dealing with bioc voting
was a fear that a party system would
encourage a split along fraternity-In-
dependent lines.

The truth of the matter. is that fra-
ternity men have a ready-made organ-
ization mobilized for their support.
Brotherly love, or, more properly, the
desire for a fraternity to gain campus
prestige, ordinarily commits most
members of a house to support its
members,

Independents, on the other hand,
have no structure within which they
can work to boost their support, un-
less, of course, they organize their own
combine. But they are forbidden by
the anachronistic rule against organ-
ized campaigning.

The split in student opinion over
subsidized athletics demonstrates
there exists considerable feeling on a
vital issue, feeling that transcends the
fraternity-Independent division. What
removing the ban on bloc voting would
do is open the way for students in
agreement on a legislative program to
organize a group allowing them to
work as a unit, rather than 12 individ-
uals going off in pursuit of a pet proj-
ect. It allows people to vote as a bluc
because of common goals, rather than
“brotherhood.” By leaving the rule as
it is, the council has left Student Coun-
cil politics as they’ve always been: in-
formal, low pressure and ineffective.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Editor's Position On Athletics Challenged

Dear Editor:
Louis Lesesne’s editorial in
the Feb. 24th DAVIDSONIAN

After The ‘Flu’

Dear Editor:

We had not seen a copy of
THE DAVIDSONIAN in some
time until a friend presented
us with a copy of your edition
of Feb. 24. We were delighted
to see that your paper was
still endeavoring ‘‘to vigorous-
ly strive to keep the significant
events of the college commun-
ity before its readers,” re-
gardless of how many infini-
tives the editor splits in the
process.

We were also impressed with
the vast range of projects that
you and your writers felt they

were capable of solving—the-

Vietnam War, the National
Peace Council, the college lec-
ture series, the college book
store, the physical education
department, the college laun-
dry, subsidized athletics and
the Living Endowment.

We confess we were a little
disappointed that no mention
was made of a college barber-
shop, as from the looks of
some of the students we have
seen lately we do feel that
the tocal tonsorial parlors
could stand some improve-
ment.

Although our limited intel-

headlined ‘Athletics Again”
disturbs us with four of its
points. One is misrepresenting,

one untrue, another incom-
plete, and a fourth presump-
tuous. We know what Mr. Le-

ACTUALLY, | HAVE
BéGun Te RECONSIDER
My POSITION Ons

FRATERNITIES ~

iectual resources preclude our
commenting on all of the sub-
jects, we would like to make
a few remarks on three of
them in particular—the lecture
series, susidized athletics and
the Living Endowment.

‘The lecture series, we sub-
mit, may be the victim of the
same sort of blight that over-
whelmed Davidson athletic
teams of not too long ago. They
may not be subsidized enough.
You are probably expecting a
professional lecturer at an
amateur price. and the answer
could well be that we alumni
will have to dig even deeper
to beef up the Living Endow-
ment so that your guest lec-
turers will be brought up to
the same high intellectual level
as the present Davidson stu-
dent body.

Then too, you may not have
thought that the prospective
lecturers may have also read
your good paper, and be a lit-
tle hesitant to speak to a stu-
dent body made up of scholars
who already know it all.

On athletics, it might be bet-
ter just to ask you one ques-
tion—which is more hypocrit-
ical, to subsidize them under

Subsidized Program
Holds Alumni Interest

Dear Editor:

It is disgusting to read in
THE DAVIDSONIAN the edi-
torial, “Athletics Again.” It
is not particularly surprising,
however, since this is a typical
college newspaper editorial.

Most boys who somehow be-
come editors of college news-
papers feel it is their respon-
sibility to be opposed to some
phase of the college's activi-
ties, and this is your week to
attack our athletic program.
What will it be next week?

I was surprised, however, at
some of the names appearing
as signers of the letter-to-the
editor in the same issue. I rec-
ognize some of these boys as
being ex-athletes. Did they re-
ally read this letter before
they signed it?

I notice that they are con-
cerned about the amount of
our Living Endowment which
goes to athletics. I firmly be-
lieve that alumni giving to the

THAT

Living Endowment and their
interest in the college would
decline greatly if our subsidiz-
ed athletic program was elim-
inated. More ‘alumni are giving
more money than ever before
and our successful basketball
program has played a large
role in this.

I would agree that David-
son's reputation as an educa-
tional institution has suffered,
but I believe it might be be-
cause of some unbalanced stu-
dents rather than ‘“‘unbalanced
publicity’. Certainly the ath-
letic teams receive more pub-
licity than any other part of
our college, but is it necessar-
ily their fault?

Let our Math Department
come up with something excit-
ing and interesting and I am
sure the newspapers will give
them their share of the public-
ity.

strict college control as far.
as admissions and scholastic
standing is concerned, or to
ask students to play intercol-
legiate sports against team
that subsidize? Or make the
question shorter—if you stop
subsidizing, who are you going
to play?

Your letter writers are con-
cerned that Davidson's repu-
tation as an educational insti-
tution has suffered as a result
of unbalanced publicity re-

garding athletics. We were far~
more concerned for years with

the reputation of Davidson as
a college for men. As far as
we were concerned, if there is
no place at Davidson for the
type of young men that Homer
Smith and Lefty Driesell have
recruited, then Davidson has
lost its reason for existence.

Tf you want to turn the school
over to the type of intellectual
that already knows all the an-
swers, then let’s just have a
gtaduate schoo! and forget in-
tercollegiate athletics entirely.

Finally, the Living Endow-
ment. You might be surprised
at the percentage of alumni
who would like nothing better
than to divorce the Wildcat
Club completely from the Liv-
ing Endowment, although we
hope that this never happens.

We have enjoyed for years
the fact that we can tell our
friends who are graduates of
other colleges, that of every
dollar we contribute to David-
son, only a certain percentage
goes to athletic scholarships.
We know of no other nearby
school that has such a policy,
and until you are yourself an
alumnus, you will never real-
ize what type of an image this
balanced program has pro-
jected.

When your student letter
writers become alumni and
dues-paying contributors to the
Living Endowment, we are
sure that the entire alumni as-
sociation will welcome their
suggestions as to how the
funds are distributed. Until
that time, we would respect-
fully suggest that they devote
their time to improving the in-
tellectual climate of the col-
lege, in which they seem more
interested.

sesne is trying to destroy, but
we question his means to that
end. Here are the points:

(1) He attributes to the 20
signers of a letter-to-the-editor
the desire to ‘‘end the practice
of subsidizing athletics through
scholarships.” TheNetter was
about the formula used in es-
tablishing the percentage of
living endowment money allo-
cated for athletic scholarships.
Only half of the 20 favor an
“end to the practice.” (Many
of us who favor subsidized ath-
letics believe that the formula
should be changed.)

(2) The second point made
concerns accreditation of the
school. Mr. Lesesne states that
the Southern Association of
Schools and Colleges requires
that the entire athletic pro-
gram be put under direct su-
pervision of the faculty as a
criterion for accreditation.

Frontis Johnston, the dean
of the faculty and the chair
man, of the Faculty’s Athletic
Committee explains that his
understanding of the rule ‘is
thaf its.intention is to prevent
control of athletic programs
from outside the institution. He
further stated that Davidson
was in no danger of losing its
accreditation since our system
is in complete compliance with
the rule. ‘

(3) The editorial comment
about the Visiting Committee
from the Southern Association
and its call for “a completely
non-subsidized athletic pro-
gram” is incomplete. The
Committee did recommend
that the practice of awarding
athletic scholarships without
consideration for need be “‘out-
grown as soon as possible."’ It
also refers to our football and
basketball programs as ‘“‘pro-
fessional.”

Should not the membership
of the Committee be consid-
ered? The Chairman was from
Washington and Lee and the
other members were from Bir-
mingham-Southern, University
of the South, Dartmouth, Co-
lumbia. Vanderbilt, and the

those .is directiy concerned
with intercollegiate athletics.
The membership of that com.
mittee and the 1/75 ratio both-
ers us as we hear people sup-
port their arguments by re-
ferring to the Report.

Incidentally, the Report con-
tains a recommendation that
Davidson consider awarding
full scholarships based on mer
it. The University of North
Carolina's Morehead Scholar-
ship is mentioned as an ex-
ample. If this were done. one
of the arguments against full
scholarships for _ athletics
would be eliminated.

(4) The writer of the edi
torial states that “‘it would be
difficult for the trustees to ig-
nore such a concerted protest
on the part of student body
leaders.'’ The concern of those
leaders about the ‘‘formula’”’
should and will get trustee at-
tention: however. the writer
makes the above statement
after two paragraphs about
“subsidizing’’ and ‘‘profession.
al’ and not one word about
the formula. If the trustees
will have difficulty ignoring
the ‘‘concerted protest’, they
might also have some trouble
overlooking this.

We have difficulty imagining
a Davidson without the ath-
letes who can represent us at
the major college level of com-
petition. We are pleased to
have Wayne Huckel and Jim-
my Poole in our student body,
and we know they would not
be here if we did not sub-
scribe to the NCAA policy on
atthletic scholarships.

Dear Editor:

In reaction to the letter
printed in the Feb. 24th issue
of THE DAVIDSONIAN which
questioned the value of the
school’s football and basket-
ball programs as they exist to-
day. we, the graduating seni-
ors of the 1966 football team,

Embarrasses Team

Dear Editor:

You have given the athletic
department a hard time on
many issues including the
ticket situation at basketball
games. You seemed to have
some valid points until I at-
tended the last two games in
Johnston Gym. ‘

The student turnout was poor
for the Richmond game and
embarrassing (to the team)
for the V.M.I. game. Maybe
this was a stay-away protest
or maybe the Wildcats must
be nationally ranked to draw
the students.

With this kind of turnout I
can’t see that the student tick-
et problem is any problem at
all,

we would be expected to make
sacrifices, but we do not think
that those sacrifices “impeded
our education”.

The participation gave us
something which we would not
have been able to get in any
other activity. As athletes who
love football we wanted to play
the game to the best that was
in us, and we were given an
opportunity to do that.

We hope earnestly that this
great schoo! will always be at-
tractive to the serious stu-
dents who desire to excel in
football. It will not be if NCAA
specification athletic scholar-
ships are not available.

Just how Davidson's sub.
scription to NCAA rules and
regulations and its striving for
excellence in intercollegiate
athletics is ‘‘out of line with
the educational purposes of the
colilege’’ we do not under-
stand

We believe strongly that Da-
vidson should continue its sub-
sidization of athletics; and we
can say with emphasis that
we would make the same de
cision now that we made four
years ago.
