A DAVIDSON HERO.

‘Vhe Library has received a copy of a
small volume entitled, “Heroes of the
Campus,” by Joseph W. Cochran, which
contains thirteen sketches of college men,
leaders during their college life, who
gave up their lives for others, either
during their course or shortly after grad-
uation. Davidson and Maryville are the
only Southern institutions represented.
some of the others being Yale, Oberlin,
Cambridge. Williams, and Penn. State.

The Davidson sketch is that of David
Yonan, who was of the class of '96. He
was a Persian by birth, but thru his own
ambition and influence of relatives, de-
cided to come to America and complete
his educattion. He soon won for: him-
self a leading place in college activities
and in the esteem of his fellow students
and faculty, taking a prominent part in
athletic, literary and social activities both
within and without the college walls.
He won a place on the varsity football
team, and played tackle and halfback
for three years, and was declared by
coaches to be one of the best in the South.
Yonan made high grades thruout his col-
lege course. and in 1900 received his
degree of A.B. It was his purpose to
enter a medical college that fall and
tater return to Persia as a medical mis-
sionary.

But during the summer his brilliant
life was snuffed out. He was spending
the summer working in the neighbor-
hood and was invited on a picnic given
by the Sunday school, on the banks of
the Catawha River. During the after-
noon a number of the picnickers went tn
bathing. and a young medical student.
Fred Hobbs, gave a call for help and
was seen struggling in the water. Tho
he could not swim, and tho companions
tried to keep him out of the deep water.
Yonan sprang in without a moment's
hesitation. but was unsuccessful in his
attempt to save the life of the drowning
man, and sank after a brief struggle.
The hodies of the two students were
subsequently recovered, and tho every
means was taken to resuscitate them. it
was in vain.

“Heroes of the Campus” should prove
both interesting and helpful to all. who
may read it.

8oth Div., Camp Lee, Va.

Hello Fellows, how is every little
thing down at the old “scollege?” Wish
I could be there with you. tho | like
camp life fine.

We have about thirty-five thousand
men here and will have sixty thousand
here when all of the men get here. It
will then be the largest camp in the
United States.

1 am in the Depot Brigade, which is
intended as a reserve for the infantry as
they are put out of commission by the
cannon of the Huns.

The Y. M. C. A. is doing a great
deal of work in our camp. 1 have tried
to ally myself with this work bur feel
that I am very much handicapped by
my lack of experience. 1 am chairman
of the Regimental Advisory Committee
for the organization. The fact is, they
need men in the ranks. who will stand
up for what is right. Every man in the
Davidson faculty and — student — body,
hhould be very much at prayer for the
nen in the camps that they may be true
and quit themselves like men.

Last Sunday W. G. Sommerville, 1st
liteutenant U. S. A., led our meeting.
He had a strong message that went to
the hearts of all who were present. It
was my privilege to preside at that meet-
ing. On Thursday night I led the meet
ing myself. It was a great trial, but |
did my best.

T. H. Sommerville, ex-"17, was here
when I arrived, but has been transferred
to Massachusetts.

“Fellows.” as 1am out in the world
and compare the men [ meet with the
men | know at Davidson, Lam very glad
that UT chose Davidson as my college.

With hopes that this will be a great
vear for the college in all its departments
and with extra good wishes for the ath-
letic teams, the Y. M. C. A. and the old
class of 1918, Tam,

Yours cordially,

Lesiik H. Parrerson. ex-'18.

SPEAKS ON MARTIN LUTHER

The four hundredth anniversary of
the birth of Protestantism was cele-

brated at the Presbyterian Church last |
by |
Martin Luther, tbe pioneer leader of the lf
movement, were sung, and Dr. J. M.JE

Sabbath. written

Several hymns

McConnell delivered an address on this
great reformer. “Fhe speaker was intro-

duced by Dr. W. J. Martin, who stated |
that the college, as well as the church, |f

should participate in the celebration.

Dr. McConnell in opening remarked
that it was pleasant to turn from a study
of Twentieth Century leaders in Ger-
many to those great German leaders of
the Sixteenth Century. The economic.
intellectual, political, social and religions
life of the Sixteenth Century was ther
briefly outlined by the speaker. He de-
scribed Martin Luther as a man whose
outstanding characteristics were: 1)
impulsiveness and positiveness in convic-
tions; (2) energy and zeal; (3) courage.
In speaking of his achievements, four of
the most momentous were mentioned:
(1) breaking the domination of the Ro-
man Catholic Church; (2) giving the
common people of Germany an open
Bible; (3) giving new birth to the idea
that religion is a real part of the everv-
day life of every man. and (4) teaching
that man is responsible to God as an in-
dividual.
