en the Mountaineers at home
more than twice in the past
three decades.

Holland is very much aware
of this fact and is out to change
it tomorrow.

“West Virginia is not having
one of their better seasons,”’ ex-
plained Holland. ‘But they
have lost to some good teams.

“Since we are playing them
up there, we will really have to
be on our toes,’ explained the
Wildcat mentor. They are real
tough at home.”

The Mountaineers are not ex-
tremely deep. They will play
cautiously, so as to avoid any
foul trouble.

“I expect them to play more
of a control game than they have
in past years,” commented
Holland. ‘‘They are very young,
starting a freshman and a
sophomore.”

“They do change their of-
fenses and defenses regularly
during games,” said the four
year veteran head coach. ‘‘I am
looking for them to run in
spots.”

The Wildcats’ game plan will
be virtually the same that fans
have seen all season.

“We will try to make them
run the entire contest,”’ said
Holland. ‘“‘We think we are
much deeper than they are. We
feel running would be ex-
tremely advantageous to us.””

Look for the Wildcats defen-
sively to go from a full court
zone press to a man-to-man
alignment, hoping to keep the
Mountaineers off balance.

In the VMI encounter,
Holland looks for the “‘usual
tough game that they always

Cagers Lose Conference Lead

By JOE EARLE
Sports Editor

The Davidson cagers lost
their lead in the Southern Con-
ference in grand style to Fur-
man last week before bounding
back to their second win over an
ACC challenger. Wake Forest;
and a win over East Carolina. °

The Cats fought off a late
game surge by the Pirates at
Greenville, N.C. Wednesday
night to upend ECU 73-62.

East Carolina was only able
to take the lead twice during the
game, both times early in the
first half, and the Cats were
able to maintain an eight to ten
point margin for much of the
contest.

Greg Dunn led the Cat scorers
with 16 points followed closely
by T. J. Pecorak with 14.

The ECU win put the Cats at
11-7 for the season, and pushed
their conference standing to 5-1.

The Furman Paladins
defeated the Cats 102-4 last
Thursday in Greenville, S.C.
Prior to that match the two
teams were tied undefeated in
conference contests and were
for the lead in the SC.

That game turned into a
disaster for the Davidson
cagers early in the second quar-
ter when Furman built up a
quick 10 point lead. From there,
the Palidins controlled the
game and the Cats fell as much
as 20 points behind during some
stretches of play.

The game was dominated by
the referees. who called 79 fouls
during the course of the match.
Davidson racked up 41 per-
sonals to Furman’s 38. Three

Davidson players and one Fur-
man man fouled out.

There were several periods
during the game when the two
teams could not move from one
end of the court to the other
without one or more fouls
called. .

The Palidins handily. outshot
the Davidson players, hitting 65
percent from the floor to the
Cats’ 36 percent. Team per-
centage shooter T.J. Pecorak
hit only two of 11 from the floor.

Paul Wagner came off the
bench to lead the Cat scorers
with 16 points. followed by wing
John Falconi who added 13.
Falconi led Davidson under the
boards with nine rebounds.

Just as the South Carolina
game pointed out the
weaknesses of the Cats’ press.
the Furman game showed the
height problems that have
plagued the cagers all year.
Still, the Cats held their own un-
der the boards with 47 rebounds
compared with 49 for the
Palidins.

Sheldon Parker came into the
contest in an effort to combat
Furman's natural height ad-
vantage and added 10 points
and three rebounds.

After the loss to Furman, the

Davidson team returned to
Charlottee to down Wake Forest
86-82.
Larry Horowitz came off the
bench in that game to help the
Cats preserve a halftime lead
that was endangered several
times in the third and fourth
quarters.

Horowitz led Davidson in both

the scoring and rebounding
columns with 21 points and 11
rebounds.

Close behind Horowitz in

scoring was Dunn who hit 19
points. Dunn had only been able
to contribute nine in the effort
at Furman.

PROGRESSING AFTER INJURY

Parker ‘Key To Cage Future’

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE
Asst. Sports Editor

Whenever a left-handed hook
shot sweeps smoothly from the
baseline through the nets in
Johnston Gym, one will usually
find Sheldon Parker at the point
of origin.

The 6-8 sophomore not only
displays the soft touch with the
hook, but also has a great deal
of desire to compete and suc-
ceed.

“One of the greatest assets
that Sheldon has,"’ explained
Davidson head coach Terry
Holland, ‘is his  deter-
mination.”

With his preseason injury, he

missed most of the early
workout with the team. he has
had to make up quite bit since
then. .
“His injury slowed him down
tremendously as far as getting
in the practice and experience
that the rest of the guys have
had,” said Holland. ‘‘But he has
worked hard in practice. He is
coming along great."

Parker's size is another asset
to the Wildcats. He is one of the
bigger players on the team.

With a 220 pound frame, he
can also afford to knock it out
under the boards with any big

man.

“Sheldon has come in and
given us some big per-
formances in key games,”
praised the Wildcat head coach.
‘‘In the Duke contest he was
very effective. He also had good
games against William and
Mary and East Carolina.”’

In the Duke encounter,
Parker came into the game and
connected on five of five from
the field. He also played a good
game under the boards, trying
to offset the big men in the Blue
Devil front line.

Seeing only a limited amount
of action thus far, Parker has
not had the opportunity to get
much actual playing experience
In 11 contests, he has hit 18 of 28
from the field for a .643 shooting
percentage

“Sheldon has good speed and
quickness which should make
him a good defensive player for
the future,”’ predicted Holland.
‘‘He should figure prominently
ot _— Davidson basket-

“His hard-working attitude
and his determination to catch
up with the other players are
going to take him up to the place
where he is supposed to be,”
said Holland.

“He still needs some more

give us up there.”’

The Keydets have five star-
ters returning from last year's
squad.

“They are a good bunch of
shooters,” Holland commented.
“T think that they will try to con-
trol the tempo of the game and
look for the good shot."’

The Keydets are 5-10 thus far
and will be looking for a big up-
set. The Wildcats need a win
badly to continue a streak for a
three-game stretch at home
against three conference foes,
the last of which is Furman.

Junior guard John Falconi
still leads the Cats in the
scoring column with a 16.6
average. Greg Dunn follows the
Falcon with a 13.8 clip. T. Jay
Pecorak and Mike Sorrentino
round out the double figure
scorers at 11.0 and 10.7, respec-
tively.

Five Cats are shooting at a 50
percent mark or better. Larry
Horowitz paces this department
with a .536 average. Dunn and
Pecorak are next at .507.

Horowitz and Dunn are also
the top two in the board
statistics, hauling in an average
of 5.2 and 5.1 rebounds per
game, respectively. As a team,
the Cats aregetting 31.4rebounds
to their opponents 35.2.

Sorrentino has handed out 81
assists to date, while Falconi
has found the mark for 63.
These two also lead the free
throw shooting with Falconi hit-
ting 81 percent and Sorrentino
80 percent from the charity
stripe.

The three game home stand
for the Cats will include the
Citadel, Furman and Ap-
palachian.

The conclusion of this year's
regular season schedule will be
a contest with the flyers of
Dayton in Ohio.

The Cats will then head for
Richmond and the Southern
Conference Tournament, which
will determine the extent of
Davidson's post-season com-
petition.

polish on offense as well as
‘some more experience on the
defensive angle,’’ Holland com-
mented. ‘‘He is not afraid to get
under the boards and fight it out
in the roughest situations. That
is the kind of player you want on
your front line.”

As the experience and op-
portunities begin to mount up,
Parker heads for his big chance
in the starting front line for the
Wildcats.
