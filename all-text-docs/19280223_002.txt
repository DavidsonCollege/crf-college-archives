News and Views of Wildcat

Events

By Raymond Lake

Neither the varsity nor the freshman trip
could very well be called a success. The big
team took a trip lasting about eight days and
played five games during that time, losing all
of them except the one with the College of
Charleston and the one with Wofford. The
game with Furman was lost by only a few
points, but, as the old sayling goes, “a miss
is as good as a mile.” The varsity are on
their last trip now, and will close the 1928
basketball season tonight with their game
with Guilford. Unless they show better
form than they have shown during most of
the season, the game tonight will in all prob-

ability end with the Wildcats on the bottom. |

The Quakers won the first game from the
Wildcats earlier in the season, and have a
good chance to repeat their action if we can
trust comparative scores and other equa'ly
as undependable indicators. However, it is
not the custom of the Wildcat to begin a
season poorly, play poorly during the season,
and then end the season with a defeat, so we
are looking for something better than ustal
in the result of tonight's game.

The freshman trip was not even as suc-
cessful as that of the varsity. The freshmen
played four games while they were gone and
lost all four of them. Their trip, judging
from the results of their games, might be
called a total. failure. From all the reports
we can hear, however, the freshmen did not
play badly; they were simply outclassed and

‘were not able to show up against the better

teams. Looking back over that part of the
sport year which has passed, one would be
inclined to be blue over the past season as
well as the prospects for the future.

We must remember, however, that a small
institution like Davidson cannot be expected
to be outstanding in the sport world every
year. Last year the Wildcats won the state
championship in football and were unques-
tionably atthe top of the North Carolina
gridiron list, but’as a result o the loss of so
many of last year’s team, the Wildcats have
had to accept a lower place this year. Every
team must have its “downs” as well as its
“ups,” and Davidson is now in one of her
“down” periods.

Wildcat Matmen Leave
Friday for Two Meets

Grapplers t oClose Season With
Duke Match

|

|

The Wildcat wrestling team leaves tomor- |
row on their last trip of the season, wah
will include matches with State and Duke. |
The State team will be met in Raleigh on |
Saturday, February 25th, and then the Cats |
visit Duke, Monday, February 27th, to close |
their season. Strong competition and close |
scores are expected in both matches with a |
possible decision ‘of the state shamnpioounip
resting on the final match. |

State College lost one of their early |
matches to Carolina by a close score. Da-
vidson beat Carolina 13 1-2 to 7 1-2, on Feb-
ruary 4th. This gives the 'Cats a slight edge |
over the Wolfpack. However, the winner |
will come out with hardly enough advantage |
to glory over. |

In the Duke match the odds are against |
the Davidson team. Duke defeated Carolina |
24 tp 3 and latér romped on V. M. I. to the |
tune of 21 to 6. Although the ’Cats took |
Carolina down they lost to V. M. I. 13 1-2 to!
9 1-2,

Coach Tilson’s charges ate all in good
shape except for a few mat burns received
in the Virginia trip. Frank Brown, wrest-
ling in the 125 pound class, has a rather
severe burn on his left arm that may hinder
him slightly. Baker will wrestle the unlimit-
ed class in place of Christenbury, who will
wrestle in the 165 pound class. Brohard was
forced to go to the infirmary with an infected
knee.

The team leaves Friday afternaon for
Raleigh and will return Tuesday morning.
The Davidson line-up will be as follows:
Flythe, 115 1b. class; Brown, 125 Ib. class;
Herriott, 135 lb. class; Garrison, 145 th.
class; Christenburg, 165 lb. class; Hill, 175
Ib. class; and Baker, unlimited.

Citadel, Furman, and Clemson Win
Over ’Cats

EXTENSIVE TRIP
Wildcats Win Easily Over College of

Charleston Team and Wofford
Terriers

The Davidson College basketball team re-

turned to the hill Saturday morning from an
eight-day invasion of the

Palmetto., State
with a record of two victories and three de-
feats, having won from the College of
Charleston and Wofford, and lost games to
The Citadel, Furman and Clemson.

With a victory and a defeat behind them
the Wildcats took on Clemson College Wed- |
nesday night only to find that they were no!
match for the superior team work and Thee
ing of the Tiger cagers who, playing their
last home game of the season, and aided by
the brilliant playing of Hewitt, Clemson for-
ward, were able to win 35 to 24. Captain
Wilson trailed Hewitt, high’ scorer, by one
point.

From Clemson the Wildcat ‘cagers jour-
neyed to Greenville to take on the Furman |
University team only to be beaten again, but
this time by a much closer score of 32-27.
The Purple Hurricane got away for a big
lead, but by the end of the half they had
caught up and the score was 12 to 14, the
Wildcats leading. The opening of the sec-
ond half again began with the Furman bas-
keteers leading off and as before they gained
a 12-point lead with their rally before the
Wildcats stopped the scoring. Monk's cagers
came back strong but the rally was too late,
for they were never able to catch up with
Furman’s lead and the game ended 32-27,
Furman on the big end.

In the last game, an adieu to the Palmetto
State for the 1928 season, the Wildcats flash-
ed a fast cage game in the second half of
the tilt to win from Wofford by a score of
37-26. Wofford led with early scoring, but
the Wildcats soon took the lead and the half
closed 20 to 12. The second half only gave
Davidson more opportunity for scoring and
the game closed with the Wildcats well in
the lead.

Pitchers and Catchers
in Pre-Season Training

Batteries Loosen Up Muscles for
Early

Although baseball practice has not official-
ly begun as yet, the call for pitchers and
catchers has been issued, and the Davidson
batteries are being whipped into shape. The
pitchers are slowly surely loosening the
winter kinks out of their arms, and the catch-
ers are getting loosened up so that they can
catch the high fast balls and low out curves.

The men who answered the call were:
Pitchers, Maulden, Henderson, Kugler, and
McInnes; catcher, McGeachy. In addition
to these men, Cathey is expected out for the

pling bose a few days, and Dick
Grey and Be Aulay have expressed their
intention to try out for the backstop position.

Although if is rather early to make any
predictions as to the strength of the team
this year, it is certain that there should be no
cause for evil forebodings. In the infield
from last year’s team are Captain Dulin, Lit-
tlejohn, Johnny Kugler, Pat Crawford, and
Charlie Harrison. In the outfield are Ratch-
ford and Hal Johnson. From last year's
Freshman team come Tut McConnell and
Whiz Miller, in the outfield, and Henry Cox,
in the infield.

Manager Bob Link and his cohorts are

There has been quite a bit of talk on the
campus for the last few days about a de-
cision of the board of trustees relative to a
course in physical education’ next year or in
the near future. ‘Though the details of the
board’s decision are not definitely known, we
do know that the current story about a com-
pulsory physical education drill at 6:30 every
morning is, in the common language of the
campus, “a lot df, bull.” The trustees did
decide to have a physical director here in the
next year or so, but his work will be con-
ducted in a more practical manner and in a
manner more suited to the needs of an
institution of higher learning rather than a
method which might suit the needs of a mili-
tary school.

Though there has been nothing definite
about it given out yet, it seems to be a fact
that the tennis team is planning a long south-
ern trip which will be one of the best trips,
to be taken by a Davidson team. The trip
has not been finally worked out yet, but it is
probable that it will be quite an extensive
one and that matches will be played with sev-
eral leading teams of the South.

rah, fellas! I’m crazy.’—Green Goat.
