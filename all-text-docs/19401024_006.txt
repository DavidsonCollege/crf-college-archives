Dr. Forem

an Speaks

At College Vespers

©Chooses “Making Making The Correct
Decision In Time of Crisis”
) ota

Dr.. Kenneth Foreman,
fessor of Bible and Philosophy
at Davidson College, was the
speaker at the College Vespers
Sunday night.
“Choosing your path in a time
of crisis.”

Dr. Foreman said that in a case
where the decision was to be made
between something. that you ought
to do, and something you want to
do, the solution is not hard to find.
You should do what you ought to
do. Everyone has something some
little thing, perhaps, that he hates
to do. He should begin by doing
this thing. An example of this case,
Dr. Foreman. stated, the case
in which you have to decide wheth-
er or not to get up and study in
the morning, or whether or not to
shave before breakfast, or some
such trivial thing. By beginning
with little things like this, when a
big thing comes along, one is able
to cope with the situation and make
the right decision.

: Second Decision

Another decision which has to
be made the decision between
two things which ought to be
done. This situation is even harder
for the Christian to meet than the
other, One should choose the one
which he thinks is the best for
him to do. For example, Dr. Fore-
man told of two men he knew who
went as missionaries to Mexico.

Both of these men had strong
convictions as to what was wrong
and what was right. A proclama-
tion was passed by the Mexican
government which prohibited “any
foreigner from being a_ preacher.
One of the men said to himself,
“There are two things which IL
ought to do. One is to be a preacher
and the other is to be in Mexico
and help these people.” He chose
to stay in Mexico, and even if he
could not preach, he could help
the people there.

The other man thought about the
same thing, but it seemed more im-
portant to him to bea preacher,
so he went back to the States and
served as a preacher in another
field. Both of these men chose, and
neither of them was wrong. Each
chose what he thought that he
should do “no matter what.”

Third Decision

Thé last and most difficult case,

pro-

He spoke on

is

is

Dr. Fofeman said, is the case when
a decision has to be made between
two things which are both wrong—
a case where either thing you do is
wrong, and not dojng anything is
equally wrong. Then, Dr. Fore-
man stated, the thing to do is to
choose the lesser evil. Use imagina-
tion and think about what you be-
lieve the lesser of the two evils.
Everyone will not agree as to what
the right thing do War,
which is raging in Europe today,
and may shortly be here in Amer-
ica, and which may last for many
years to come, is an excellent ex-
ample of this case. A person who
does not believe in war, as Dr.
Foreman said he does not, is in a
-terrible fix. A conscientious objec-
tor, men say, is helping the ene-
my, while when one bécomes a sol-
dier and shoulders a gun with which
to kill men, he sins by killing men
and also by killing and injuring in-
nocent people—women and_ chil-
dren who have nothing. to do with
the war. In a case of this sort, Dr.
Foreman said, the only thing to do
to decide which of these two
evils seems to you to be the lesser
and to act in accordance with this
decision.

Students Find

Registrar’s Office ‘s Scene Of

By BILL LYMAN
On Friday
classmen will march into Mr. Hen-

going to the funeral of their best

friend. Some will come out joyous,
but, alas, most will look either
very dejected or very belligerent.

All due to the fact that tomorrow

or Saturday the first six weeks’

grades will be issued from the

registrar's office.

Those students who ate joyous

worry about except their minority.

and the corresponding professor;

fourthly, he decides to take action
and tell off the said tyrant him-
self. Joe College then stalks up to
the prof’s room, but by the time
he is at the door his fury has de-
cidedly abated.

The professor expecting a

turbed over the hurt feelings of
said student. Whereupon a polite
but usually restrained argument
takes place and it turns out that
the student is wrong anyhow. He
has forgotten to take into consid-
eration daily grades, or a certain
writ not made up, or etc. etc. The
student goes away-feeling that he
has somehow been “smooth-talked”
out of the whole thing and later
thinks of numerous words that he
wishes he had said. This righteous
indignation usually dies down after
about a week, however, and Joe
College begins thinking about the
next review.

The subsequent problem confront-
ing both the dejected and belliger-
ent student is how to explain these
grades to the family. Let's look: at
Joe's report card:

Explanations run something like
this: English is terribly hard this
semester and I was lucky even to
pass; I really deserved at least a
B in Spanish and probably B+; in
Bible I had good daily grades but
messed up on the review as the
professor tried to see how tricky
his questions could be; I’m improv-
ing in economics every day, etc. etc,
Then follows the usual vow to
raise those grades and if the folks
will just have patience they'll see
a miraculous rise in the mid-semes-
ter report. Joe is most sincere in
his resolutions, and studies very
hard for about a week, after which
the lures of college life gradually
weaken his resistance to the for-
mer spasmodic driving. Oh, well,
“one can get more from bull ses-
sions and activities than the class-
room anyhow, so what the heck!”

Circulation Spans Over Conti-
nents Of World

By FRANK SANFORD

When the producers of the Da-
vidsonian go into a huddle over
an issue they are gratified to know
that they may reach some Jean
Coed or Betty College whether she
be out in sunny California or way
up in Maine.

Since almost half of our total
circulation of 1,200 is sent to. Miss
Fairer Sex we feel safe in saying
that her heart must throb when
she sees that dearest Joe is now the
president of Alpha Beta Gamma or
Zeta Eta Theta.

In addition to nearly every state
in the Union we get out into the
wilds of Africa and down into
Mexico. Our outside circulation has
almost doubled in the last year or
two so we maw be able soon to
use a famous business slogan, “It
Covers the Earth.”

We have some alumni who have
taken the paper ever since~it™was
founded in 1915 and even men who
left in 1903 that still keep up with
their Alma Mater through the
weekly gazette.

when the president of the student

Well, Rome wasn’t built in a

can take a little more time to get
settled down. But after we get used
to the water fights, and the laun-
