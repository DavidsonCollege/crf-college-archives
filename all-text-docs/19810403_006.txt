6—The Davidsonian—April 3, 1981

Inside IMAC

Softball season is underway, and there are a lot of games to
rt. :

win the preseason polls I placed the Bad Pikes high in the
rankings, but thus far the PIKAs just haven’t been able to get it
together. They lost their first game to the Hosebag Hunters
(alias Noops and his bandwagon of SPES). The Bad Pikes
probably have more power hitters than any other team, but their
turnout has been low. They dropped their second game to the
. Masterbatters. The Hosebag
Hunters went on to pick up
their second victory by defeat-
ing the Busch Boys. The Hose-
bag Hunters look as though
they are definitely one of the top
teams this year.
__ The Perpetual Perpetrators
are another team which I pick to do well. The Perpetrators’
strength lies in their ability to be intimidating. While the team
doesn’t have much speed, they have plenty of size. They
destroyed the Keg Killers and in their second game embarrassed
the Masterbatters 19 to 4. As I said before, the Perpetual
Petpetrators are intimidating. The team consists of such Duke
Dorm ruffians as PJ (Pat Sheridan), Danny Klinar, Steve
Herman Lowe, Mitch, Dean, Fahey, Attar, Whitmire and other
football players who can bench twice their body weight.

The upset of the week belongs the Skoal Brothers, who beat
the Brick Brothers’ number one team Pissin’ in the Wind..

In other games, The Old Men defeated the Art Department,
Off Again beat the Busch Boys with the help of their allstar
shortfielder Zeebo, and Phi Delt abused PAX.

In women’s IMAC, the Bottom Liners beat Filthy Rich 10 to

Cats come together to beat UNCC

By STEVE SOUD
Staff Writer

The story of the baseball team so far has been a
rollercoaster ride. One day they’ll blow a team off
the diamond, the next day they’ll give a game
away. Although a few players have shown
exceptional consistency, the team itself has
lacked the magic word. Generally, when the
pitchers have been on, the bats have let them
down. Sometimes, neither pitchers nor batters
came through.

One of the few exceptions to what is fast
becoming a rule of inconsistency was the game
against UNCC last Thursday night, as the Cats
doled out a 15-1 drubbing to the ‘Niners. Pitching
came around as Rusty Colechia pitched nine solid
innings of six-hit ball. The bats came through as
Earl Ransom cracked a grand slam and Joby
Merten hit a three-run shot.

Then things turned around as Western
Carolina completed a twin-killing that was
important to Wildcat Southern Conference hopes.
Although freshman Scott Redding came through
on the mound, the bats weren’t behind him, and
the team forfeited a bottom-of-the-seventh, bases
loaded, no-out situation by hitting into a double
play. The Wildcats lost 1-0.

In the second game, the pitching didn’t come
through. The visiting Catamounts held a 7-2 lead
after three innings, but the hosts scratched back

Lynchburg College last Satur-
day 83-66 to run the. season re-

to pull within one run. After a crucial walk, the
wind came out of Davidson’s comeback. A
Western Carolina fly ball sailed over the fence;
leaving the final score at 9-6.

Pitching is still the major obstacle to a winning
season, as a 6.00 team earned run average (ERA)
attests. ‘‘A few of the pitchers have started really
well,’’ Coach Charlie Slagle said. ‘‘Colechia and
Redding have given up only 3 runs each in their
last two starts. We’re looking for a couple more
consistent starters. If we get some, the second
half of the season should be better.’’

So far the hitting has posed little problem, as
the team maintains a .300 clip. Phil Gorden
continues to hover around .400, and has played
well behind the plate. John Porter’s lumber is
coming out of its sleep as his average climbed to
.338. As Slagle pointed out, ‘You can’t complain

about our hitting.’

Although the team’s overall record is 8-14 (2-4
in the conference), it has a good chance to even up
the columns a little this week. After a game
against Methodist today, the team faces Pfeiffer
tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. On Saturday and Monday
at 1:00 p.m. the team is slated to face UT-C and
East Tennessee in a pair of key conference
doubleheaders. Then Tuesday the team meets
powerful N.C. State. If the Wildcats can achieve
consistency, they may have a winning week.

the 200 meter dash (22:97).

Baskin and sailing team take
2nd in Lake Norman regatta

By ERIC SANNER
Staff Writer

Consistency proved to be the
key in a regatta here at the
Davidson lake campus last Sat-
urday. The Davidson sailing
team finished second of six
teams, never placing below
third in any of the ten races. Old
Dominion University, which
won the regatta, was the only
team that consistently: bested
the ’Cats.

Senior Captain Stuart Baskin
and hard-working crew Kath-
leen Huff sailed. well together
and finished second in the
A-Fleet.. Baskin’s sharp man-
euvers proved why he was
chosen as an All-District sailor
last year.

_ Holding the regatta at David-

son allowed more Davidson

team members a chance to race.
Three skippers and three crews
sailed in the B-Fleet for David-
son.

Kathy Bell and crew Mary
McArn participated in their
first regatta. Despite several
mistakes, they demonstrated
some excellent maneuvers.Gary
Walton and crew John Stan-
back sailed tenaciously, while
Bill Bankhead and crew Becky
Waters also demonstrated good
tactics. The three groups finish-
ed second in the B-Fleet.

This Saturday the Cats will
be at the University of Virginia.
If they do well, they will qualify
for the South Atlantic Intercol-
legiate Sailing Association Din-
ghy Championship to be held on
Lake Norman April 17-18.

_ With a 6-1 record, the team is
experiencing one of the most
successful seasons in recent his-
tory. The team hosts the David-
son Relays Saturday, and hopes
to place well against the numer-
ous competitors in that event.
