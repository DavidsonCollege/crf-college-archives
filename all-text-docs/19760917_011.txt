First full time woman coach
joins Davidson athletic staff

By MARK SCANDLING
Staff Writer

Davidson College hired
Susan Roberts to be its first
full time, exclusively women’s
athletic coach over several
hundred other applilcants this
summer.

Miss Roberts is young, and
her coaching experience is
limited. However, she played
field hockey and basketball
during her four years at Ohio
University, and last year she
was an assistant basketball
coach at the University of
Arizona.

She has a working know-
ledge of the sports she will
coach.

Field hockey, the newest
sport on campus, will be her
main concern this fall, and
Roberts has been surprised by
the participation and intrest
that has been shown thus far.

“I’m excited about coach-
ing, and the girls are excited
about playing,’’ she said.
Whether there will be enough
excitement to attract specta-
tors remains to be seen, yet
Roberts expects many people
to come see the games out of
curiosity.

Basketball will occupy
Robert’s time during the win-
ter months. Preparation for
. the season has already begun,
as the Wildkittens have been
introduced to the weightlifting
room by their new coach.

Roberts knows little about
the other schools in this area,
but she hopes to restore the
girl’s basketball tem to its
winning ways of 1973-4 and
74-5.

Scholarships are a contro-
versial subject in women’s and
men’s sports circles today.
Some of the women players
have indicated that they favor
a scholarship program for

women’s sports at Davidson.
Others enjoy participating
under the present system.
Roberts favors running a
program without scholarships,
yet she predicts that scholar-
ships are to be a necessary evil
if Davidson is to continue
competing at the present level.
‘A big-time program’”’ is
not her goal, however. She
still wants a program where
anyone can play, but where

some money would be avail-
able to. aid a top-quality
player.

Roberts” realizes that
scholarships are not a present
reality, that they remain in the
future. She is willing and
eager to work and coach under
the present system.

Roberts says she is glad to
be here, and thus far it
appears that the girls are glad
to have her here. °

‘Cat football team
debuts Saturday

By GEORGE STROBEL
Staff Writer

Davidson College football
season opens Saturday as the
Wildcats take on Colgate Col-
lege at 2:00 in Richardson
Stadium.

Coach Edward Farrell ex-
pects Colgate to be the ’Cats’
toughest opposition this year,

as the team comes to David- .

son after downing the Univer-
sity of Connecticut 13-7 last
week.

The Wildcats have 19 retur-
ning lettermen this year—11
on defense and eight on of-
fense. Besides these players,
several promising freshmen
have joined the squad.

The defense is expected to
be the backbone of the team
this year, according to Farrell.
Unfortunately, two defensive
linemen, Frank Fields at de-
fensive tackle and Mike Sheri-
dan at nose guard will not be
able to start Saturday.

The offense, after a year of
experience together, should
prove more powerful, accord-
ing to Farrell. Bob McCarthy
will start at quarterback, and
the fullback position has three

Rhye, and Keith Hertzog.

Farrell expects to fill the
halfback position with fresh-
men.

After Saturday’s game, the
Wildcats will take on Bucknell
College at 2:00 here in Rich-
ardson Stadium.
