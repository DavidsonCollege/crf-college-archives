STUD STORE
(Continued from page 1)
During this period, when the stu-
dent body consisted mainly of Army
cadets, a closed counter system was
in operation. With the return to
normal times, students who had
known the open counter system em-
ployed before the war, persuaded
the college authorities to reinaug-
urate this method on somewhat of
a probationary basis. These old
students especially are anxious to

Improvements
Under the direction of student
manager Long and Mr. William
Tellford of Charlotte, graduate

manager, the “Stud” is continually
improving, despite the universal
difficulty of getting items to sell,
and it will soon be on a par with
such stores in other large schools.

Among innovations scheduled are
a sandwich toaster, already ordered,
and a soda fountain. The managers
sincerely desire that students do
not hesitate to offer to them sug-
gestions about operation or criti-
cisms concerning quality or price
of merchandise. “And don’t for-
get,” Long adds, “the ‘Stud’ will
be open every Sunday night at
12:00.”
