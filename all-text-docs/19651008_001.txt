RICHARDSON SCHOLARS TALK ON AMERICAN LIFE
From Left To Right, Goytie, J orchel, Rytsela And Adachi

Foreigners Compare

Four Richardson Scholars

gave thelr candid opinions of
America at Open End Wednes-
day night.

Erhard Jorchel or: Germany,
Klaus Rytsala of Finland, Hiro-
Mi Adachi of Japan and Daniel
Goytia of Argentina agreed

there existed in America less ,

individual. freedom in America
than they found in their home
countries.

Compulsory attendance at
classes or religious exercises
was almost unknown to them
before coming to Davidson, and
though most universities in their
homelands are government-sup-
ported, there is little govern-
ment. intervention in school af
fairs.

Adachi and Rytsala admitted
that studies here are harder

European and Latin American
universities appeared to place
little emphasis on test and ex-
aminations. Courses often con-
sist entirely of lectures, with
the only test being the final ex-
amination.

In the question-and-answer
period that followed the discus-
sion, the Richardson Scholars
were asked about the political
and social interests of students
in their own countries.

It was generally agreed that
dating was more reserved than
in America. In Germany there
is less formal dating, but more
casual ‘meetings in clubs and
restaurantsr

In. Latin American, morality
is more strict than in the United
States or Europe and there is
little or no dating as Americans
know f:.

Political freedom. 1s common

The consensus of the
council at its meeting Mon-
day night was that all con-
tacts of this sort should be
made through hall coun-
selors when possible. If a
hall counselor can not be
found to clear the visit then

Tom Covington Defends
IFC Rush Regulations

Problems involved in the
institution of the new rush
system have prompted Tom
Covington, assistant dean of
students, to submit to THE
DAVIDSONIAN a statement
which asks that all persons
concerned reason “through
the spirit of the law” and
act accordingly.

Covington states that while
“there is room for criticism
of the current rules.” there are
als6 many areas in which the
IFC's system Is worthy of sup.

of the current rules, There
would also appear to be ample
room for these same rules to
be supported—in “‘spirit/'—by

the fraternity man and_ the.

Freshman Class. For example,
no individual fraternity has
formally gone on record as en-
dorsing these rules, and while
this action may be presumed
through the IFC representative,
I doubt he would object to such
formal. overt support.
“Similarly: it is presumed that

the Freshman Council could
take some initiative on this
front and formally support the
IFC in its effort to work through,
enforce, and evaluate this new
system.

“Tt would appear obvious that
the surest way for fraternity
man and freshman to under-
mine the IFC's efforts—and the
current rush structure—would be
to fail to exercise this endorse-
ment whether formal or im-
plied."

with him at a coffee in the
Union following chapel.

His topic is undecided now,
but Dean Frontis W. Johnston,
chairman of the Reynolds Lec-
tureship Program, predicts that
it will deal with “economic and
political matters.”

Hollowood has been editor of
Punch since 1958. Sometimes
called “the British New York-
er,” Punch is a humor magazine
that comments on contempor.
ary political, economic and so-
clal issues.

Hollowood was educated at
St. Paul’s College in Chelten-
ham and received a degree in
economics from the University
of London.

From 1932-1943 he served as.

‘lecturer in economics in the

School’ of Commerce, Stoke-on-
Trent, and at Laughborough Col-
lege. Since then he has served
as a staff member of The Eco-
nomist, a research officer in the
Council of Industrial Design and
a newspaper cartoonist.

than they had expected. In
Japan a student has to work
hard in high school to gain ad-
mittance to a college, but less
work is required to graduate
than in America.

According to Goytia, Latin
American students are not as
well-versed in mathematics and
natural sciences as American
students, but are better prepared
in social studies.

RITSCHL ON THE FUTURE
“The Advantage Of Hope”

Ritschl Views Church Today

By LINDSAY DAVIS
Davidsoniaon Feseture Writer

“The answers of the past,
of the Reformers, are not
sufficient in strength and
‘depth for the questions of
the present and future.”
Thus began Dr. Dietrich
Ritschil, 1965-66 Otts Lec-
turer, in his third lecture,
‘The Dimensions. of the
Present: Past and Future.”

Dr. Ritschl listed these con-
clusions from the preceding
presentation: 1) Serving God is
not the same as serving man;
2) the Old Testament view of
God as a political reality who
called a nation, gave law, land,
and kingship still holds; 3) the
actions of Christians are not of
higher value than non-Chris-

dents countries. Although nearly | Concerning

Covington’s statement in its en-;

difference,’ added Ritschl, ‘‘who
is served, a Viet Cong, a John
Bircher, or my wife."

Ritsch! notes that throughout
the Old and New Testaments
the responses of God are bound
by situation, time, and place.
“God is a god who moves with
the people through history, a
God of promise and fulfillment.”
God sometimes demanded from
the people what he forbade at
other times and situations.

Humanists, are not identical
with Humanists.

There is a definite fallacy in
the thinking of churchmen of
today, he explained, that man
serves the Church with good
works. ‘“‘Man does not serve the
Church, he serves as_ the
Church.” It is, therefore, not
God who receives our good
works, but man, ‘’God only re-
ceives prayers,’ Ritschl con-
tinued, “‘but man receives other
men’s actions.”

Ritsch! finds support for this
view in the teachings of Christ
as He taught His followers to
pray as a Church because of
and in belief of man. “Serv-
ing men," Ritschl asserted, ‘‘fol-

This, then, is the ethical cri-

of Christians and non-Christians

without fear.”

The non-Christian, however.
while also honest in his outlook
on the past, can be afraid of the
future. Or, as in the case of the
USSR, can hope in the future,
but be afraid of the past.

“The Christian has the advan-
tage of hope.”’ continued Ritschl.
“His ultimate hope reflects his
lesser hopes and rules them.
If one hope fails, he does not
give up.”

In a language of twisted and
reversed modifiers, Dr. Ritschl
explained how a Christian can
be properly involved. ‘‘He must

Alumni Association
To Meet Next Week

Prominent leaders of the Dav-
idson College Alumni: Associa-
tion will converge on the cam-
pus next weekend for the Alumni
Leaders Conference.

Representatives from some °3
chapters of the association will
be present for the two-day brief-
ing session.

The annual conference seeks
to review the progress of the
college during the past year and
to make plans for the coming
year. ‘My experience is that it
(the conference) is a fast-mov-
ing program which will impress
the alumni leaders,"’ explained
Bill Bondurant, director of
alumni activities.

Alumni leaders will arrive Fri-
day afternoon. Recreation, in-
cluding sailing at the Lake Cam-
pus. is scheduled. After dinner
Friday night, Dr. Earl R. Mac-
Cormac will speak to the group
about the Humanities program.

Saturday morning will be de-
voted to small discussion groups
and a major planning session
concerning the Ford Foundation
grant. The entire group will
attend the Wiliam and Mary
game on Saturday afternoon.

“TI have been reading Mr.
Hollowood's _ editorials for
years.” he said. ‘“‘Last summer
when he published one on the
international monetary problem, -
I wrote him a letter saying that
it was unfair and un-American.
and I hoped un-English, for an
editor of a ‘humor magazine’
to write so lucidly and intelligi-
bly about economic matters.

“He replied and told. me that
he was going to be in the U. S.
this fall ‘to preach to the heath.
en and unconverted—strictly as
a humorist, of course.’

“T wrote back and asked him
to come to Davidson because we
had more unreconstructed heath-
en and unconverted than anv-_
other area in the world. As a
result of all this. he’s. agreed
to come. ;

“Since then I've found out that

jhe has a degree in economics

and he publishes books on the
subject. But that merely proves
that the American education sys-
tem is better than the British,
because no self-respecting Amer-
ican university would graduate
a PhD in economics who could
write so lucidly and clearly.”

The Reynolds Lectureship
Fund was established four years
ago through the resources of the
Z. Smith. Reynolds Foundation
“to provide an annual series of
distinguished guest authorities
in humanities, sciences, arts and
philosophy who will be invited to
serve as ‘professors in resi-
dence’ at Davidson College for
periods of from two to three
days.”

Armfield Is Elected
To Honor Court Seat

Ed Armfield was elected by the Junior Class
Tuesday to fill the Honor Court vacancy created by
Lloyd Davidson's absence from school this year.

Armfield collected 62 votes in the final runoff
against Don Carroll, who pulled 56 votes. In the third
day of balloting on Monday, Carroll led with 48
votes to Armfield’s 37. Paul Curlee was eliminated in

this runoff with 26 votes.
