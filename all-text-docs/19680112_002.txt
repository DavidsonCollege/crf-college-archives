Disfranchisement

The role given to students and fac-
ulty in the selection of a successor to
Dr. D. Grier Martin as president of
the college is not really as pitiful as it
sounds.

Unofficially, the word is that facul-
ty members and students may have
more influence in the selection pro-
cess than the weak sounding position
of advisory committees would indi-
cate. Some members of the college
community have said they would not
be at all surprised if the advisory com-
mittees were asked to meet with candi-
dates and submit reports of their im-
pressions as a result of those meetings.

Close attention has been promised
to the recommendations of the stu-
dent and faculty groups. Their opin-
jons may play a significant role in
helping the selection conimittee make
up its mind.

It is. however, very disappointing
that the actual selection committee
will not include members of the facul-
ty and student body. When the de-
cision-making process gets right down
to the real nitty-gritty, it will be a
group of four key trustees that will
make the final recommendation to
Board of Trustees for approval.

This should at least ensure the selec-
tion of a candidate who will be satis-
factory to the trustees. And. after all,
the president of a college should en-
joy a pleasant. relationship with the
body that hires and fires him.

Because there is little reason to
doubt. the integrity and lovalty to the
college of the four men who will make
up the selection committee. it is pro-
bable that their candidate will not
send faculty members and students
into a rage of disgust.

It is quite true that the right to cast
one ballot in such a decision is not a

particularly impressive instrument of
power.

On the other hand the fact that one
is present for the discussion leading
up to that vote can be very significant.
This presence allows one to give a
final rebuttal to any objections raised
against one’s case.

The power to attempt to persuade
others when they have finished play-
ing games is much more useful than
the vote that may also be attached to

that power.

It is certainly much more influen-
tial than simply making one of sev-
eral recommendations. Even the
chance to appear in person to answer
questions from the group ‘making the
real. decision may not be really im-,
portant.

The trustees have to worry twice a
vear about a president who is not able,
to merit confidence from the students
and faculty members at his college.
The latter two groups, however, bear
the consequences of his decisions each
day of the school year. It-is only prop-
er, therefore, that they have an in-
fluential voice in choosing the man
who will chart the course of their daily
existence. ;

In explaining why the executive
committee of the trustees excluded
the faculty and student body from a
direct role in choosing the new presi-
dent, Walter L. Lingle. chairman of
the Board of Trustees points out that
such an action is not legal according
to the charter of the Board of Trus-
tees.

If indeed there is no way to reinter-
pret the provisions of that charter, it
would be extremely disappointing if
we waited until the resignation of our
next president to consider revising
that document.

Slicks Take Over

The slicks took over the campus this week.

A beautiful ceremony marked the coming of the short-lived regime.
The trees were hung with silver bunting.

A carpet of spun glass was spread across the campus,

Several students were given seats of honor. Afterwards they were given
medical advice and treatment for their bruises and broken bones they re-

ceived in occupying those seats.

The judicious use of salt might have saved them from their pains.
But after all this is North Carolina. And who ever heard of freezing

rain that amounted to anything?

Dear Rushee,

Dear Rushee,

Rejection is a term the meaning of
which is significant not just to senior
grad school applicants. In years past
the term has often entered into dis-
cussions about a freshman’s participa-
tion in. the fraternity system. It has
even been the focal point of many of
these discussions.

Logically the term probably is be-
coming of some concern to you and
many of your friends these days. Be-
Side the exam schedules posted on
various campus bulletin boards have
appeared posters headed ‘“Rushee.”
You have probably concluded there-
fore that something besides exams is
beginning to concern the thoughts of
some Davidson students.

Your much-heralded perceptive
abilities once again proved indubitable.
There is indeed something else. After
a few days of post-exam recuperation,
you will be exposed to the changing
Davidson tradition of rush.

If you are the least bit normal, you
probably have some fears that as this
time approaches you will make some
mistakes, leading to the awesome tor-
ture of REJECTION. .

Please allow us to quiet your fears.
Rejection is no longer the great fear

that it once was at our now-liberated
campus. We have become open-mind-
ed. No longer do we reject people.

Yes, there probably will be some
people who snicker. “Look at that guy
—he isn’t socially competent. He is a
mother’s boy who has to be nursed
along socially.”

There may even be a few who will
sneer, ‘See how he has withdrawn
from ‘where the action is—-he can’t
compete.”

But, rushee, do not be intimidated.
You can show these backward in-
dividuals that you know how to get
the most from your precious few years
as an undergraduate.

You may find seniors now regret-
ting having had to take the course you
choose. You may find that others who
have experienced: what you now
choose are seeking to find more realis-
tic solutions to their social problems.

But you will not be rejected, rushee,
because of any mistakes you make.
You can still make a success of your
eollege career. Others have.

You may even meet some girls who
will actually think you are a pretty
slick guy because you decided to wear
a fraternity pin.

And you always get to meet a lot
of nice people during rush.

We Wonder...

Members of the Davidson faculty
were instrumental in removing the
controversial speaker ban imposed at
the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill a few years ago.

Yet, while they were doing this, the
Controversial Speakers Committee
continued its quiet and normally un-
obstrusive existence at Davidson.

In its stated intention, this commit-
tee does not exist for the purpose of
imposing any sort of speaker ban at
Davidson. Statements by college offi-
cials have indicated that the only stip-
ultaion it requires of persons seeking
to give a platform to a controversial
speaker is that some provision be
made for a presentation by those who
disagree with the “controversial”
speaker.

Either through oversight or a right-
ful indignation at having to submit to
the process of having to apply to hear

a speaker, the Southern Student Or-
ganizing Committee failed to get clear-
ance from this committee before hav-
ing George Vlastis speak on campus
Wednesday.

Viastis was not prevented by the
committee from presenting his objec-
tions to the present draft system al-
though the normal requirements had
not been met.

Miss Lynn Wells, North Carolina or-
ganizer for SSOC has stated many
times that the fear of student reaction
often causes college administrators to
back down from enforcing archaic
rules. ;

Just because we are idealistic and
simple-minded, we hope the decision
by the committee not to block Vlastis
was motivated by a feeling that the
old rule need not be invoked instead of
just by fear of an unpopular reaction.

RONALD REAGAN
Academic Freedom Is Limited

Following Is a portion of
an address by Gov. Ronald
Reagan of Californias, de-
livered on Oct. 26 at Kan-
sas State University.

What is our definition of
academic freedom?

Those who teach. under.
standably enough. define it
as the right to teach as they
see fit without interference
from administrators and cer-
tainly not from those who
hold the public purse-strings
or who filt the public purse.

But those who pay for the
education—students and tax-
payers—also have a defini-
tion of academic freedom:
their freedom to have some
say in what they get for their
money.

Those holding public office
try to interpret the will of the
people and pass it on to the
university administration.
conscious always that they
must not appear to be exert.

ing political control over edu-.

cation. Equally. uncomforta
ble are the administrators

And Now!

politicians and vice versa—
they can be likened to a pris-
oner in front of a cellophane
wall being shouted at by both
sides.

And the truth is—all the
claims are legitimate and
must be reconciled within a
framework of mutual under-
standing and compromise.

The dictionary defirtes edu-
cation as “the impartation or
acquisition of knowledge.
skill, or the development of
character as by study or
discipline.”

The taxpayer is wrong who
ignores the great increase in
things we know—knowledge

acquired since he was in

school—and who demands
“no new-fangled courses:
What was good enough then is
goad enough now.”

But so is the student wrong
who would eliminate ali re-
quired courses and grades.
who would make education a
kind of four-year smorgas-
bord in which he would be the
sole judge of how far and fast
he ran in pursuit of knowl.
edge.

And that educator is wrong
who denies there are any
absolutes, who sees no black
or white of right or wrong.
but just shades of gray ina
world where discipline of any
kind is an intolerable inter-
ference with the right of the
individual.

He rebels at the old-fashion
ed idea of loco Marentis and
claims he is there to impart

knowledge. not to substitute
for absentee parents. But he
cannot escape a responsibili
ty for the students’ develop-
ment of character and ma
turity.

Strangely and iNogically.
this ‘is very often the same
educator who interprets his
academic freedom as the
right to indoctrinate students

with his view of things. Woe
to the student who challenges
his Interpretation of history, |
or who questions the econo.
mic theory given as proven
formula in what is, at best,
a very inexact science.

One thing we should all be
agreed on is the university's
obligation to teach, not indoc-
trinate.

CRAP Committee Shows

Council Active This Year

By JOHN WILLIAMS
Statf Writer ;

As one Student Council
-member walked out of the
meeting Tuesday night. he
commented: “It always
seems as if we're getting so
much done during the meet-
ing. but then when it's over.
it turns out we haven't real-
ly done much.”

At first glance this honest
opinion may be substantiat-
ed, yet this Council will
probably go down in college
history as one of the most
active of councils because of
the major reforms they
made.

The answer to this seem-
ing contradiction is that most
of the major work is being
done by separate commit-
tees appointed by the Coun-
cil. The most recent is one
which we indeed hope will
not live up to its abbreviat-
ed name CRAP —the Com-
mittee on Rules and Punish-
ments, a joint student-facul-
ty conimittee.

Hcaded by senior Mike
Carroll, the committee was
appointed by the Council to
revise the system of rules
and punishment to make it
both more realistic and more
efficient.

Dr. A. J. McKelway and
Or. Robert D. Kaylor, mem-
bers of the Bible and Religion
department, and Will Terry,
pastor of the Davidson Col.
lege Presbyterian Church,
were invited to be voting
members of the committee
both to make it more fegiti-
mate and appealing and to
reciprocate to the faculty for
the privilege of allowing stu-
dents to participate on previ-
ously all-faculty committees.

“Our basic purpose is to
update and reorganize the

regulations governing student
life.” said McKelway. “We
hope to cut down consider-
ably on the number of regu-
lations and concentrate on
principles of behavior, rather
than specific regulations. Our
guiding thought is that with
fewer regulations they will
be obeyed more readily.”

According to Carroll. the
committee is presently plac-
ing the regulations in several
categories in order that those
which are obviously unnec-
essary ‘may be either abolish-
ed or reworded for the col-
lege catalogue.

A quick fook through the
Wildcat Handbook section
listing the faculty regulations
reveats'a few antiquated and
a few hypocritical rules.

For example. the rule which
states that ‘‘when girls are in
a fraternity house, it is nec.
essary that at least two cou-
ples be present and that the
Tooms be adequately illumi-
nated" is certainly not in-
tended simply to aid David-
son's benefactor Duke Power
Co.
According to McKelway,
the most important principle
of behavior is that of “‘gen-
tlemanly conduct,"’ which he
said ‘‘may seem a bit amor.
phous and archaic. but is
still very important.” The
regulations will be adapted
to this principle and thus will
not have to be spelled out in
detail.

McKelway emphasized that
this is not just a liberalizing
committee to soften the rules.
There are some areas of stu-
dent discipline which need
better regulations, as_ evi-
denced by the damage done
to dormitories every year.

The importent thing is to
create a climate where the
students realize they are re.
sponsible for thelr dormi-

fories and will ask not “Is
this allowed?”’ bul rather “ts
this harmful?”

Another area of student
discipline which McKelway
cited as needing improve-
ment is the attitude students
take toward the campus se-
curity officers (Le., Cop Lin-
ker. etc.). He said he. ex-
pects the students will show
more respect for these men
if they are enforcing a code
that students believe in.

“Davidson College ought to
be training students to live
by a philosophy of behavior,
not just legal regulations,"’
said McKelway.

“Student life may require
more self-discipline and a
psychological readjustment
for students at first. but the
total result will be more sat-
isfactory to both students and
administration.”

Naturally there will be a
clash between students and
administration as to how
strictly the rules ought to be
enforced. This is inevitable
from the very nature of the
student position and the ad-
ministrative position.

Hopefully the clash will be
minimized by the mutual re-
spec! of both groups for the
rules and the common sense
employed in enforcing them.

At any rate, some imme.
diate changes can be made.
even if there is no basic
change in the legal philosophy
of the college. Even this
much would reward the work
of Carroll's committee.

Yet hopefully the eventual .

result will be one set of reg-
ulations governing student
life, subscribed—to
Students and faculty, which
will end forever cases such
as ‘the slightly inebriated stu-
dent who is ignored by the
students and nailed to the
wall by the administration.

The Student Council has
been asked to select a student
committee to advise the trus-
tee committee of student
views on this matter.

In addition, if any student
would like fo suggest the
name of any person as a
prospect to succeed Dr. Mar-
tin, our committee would be
interested in hearing directly
from him.

We would like to have. the
suggestions sent in writing to
Mr. William F. Mulliss, sec-

whose address is Helms, Mul.
liss, McMillan and Johnston,
800. North Carolina National
Bank Building, Charlotte.
North Carolina, 28202. Any
suggestions will, of course, be
held in strictest confidence -
by the committee.

I shall appreciate it if you
will publish this Jetter in THE
DAVIDSONIAN s0 that all of |
the students at the college
will know of this, invitation.

DIARCHY NEEDED

During the past ten years.Davidson has undergone
what has been the most revolutionary and the most
crucial period in its history. The days of crisis for the
smal], private liberal arts college are clearly a fact of
academic life. It is a time when Davidson and colleges
like it are forced either to fold up completely—or at
least to resign themselves to the position of profit- .
making diploma factories—or to put themselves in a
position where their academic excellence makes them
indispensible.

Davidson in the last few years has decided upon
the later course. Whether or not it can be agreed upon
as to exactly from what source the impetus for this
decision has come, it is obvious that an important part
in reaching it has been played by President Martin.

As has been pointed out recently, Dr. Martin has
accomplished two main goals in the last few years. He
has first led in the raising of more than $13 million
through the Ford Challenge Grant and other fund
drives, and he has led the college through a period of
severe academic change, culminating in the adoption
of the new curriculum.

These two achievements illustrate clearly the situ-
ation which Dr. Martin’s successor will face. Davidson's
new president must devote all of his energy both to
directing a new academic-intellectual program which
must grow progressively in excellence to continue to
be worthwhile, and to finding the funds for supporting
these ever expanding programs. Both jobs are essen-
tial and both jobs are becoming increasingly more dif-
ficult as their importance increases, as it must.

In the past these two functions of the president
admittedly have been important. They have become
so crucial and so demanding in recent years, in fact,
that one man can no longer handle them both. Dr.
Martin is an excellent president, but he is soon be-
coming an ex-president precisely because of the im-
portance and the demands these duties have acquired.

_ He is faced essentially with the choice of either
trying to carry out alone these duties as well as they
should be carried out, which is now impossible, or of
admitting its impossibility and resigning. To try to do
the clearly impossible would mean defeat and frustra-
tion, physical and mental, so he has taken the only
choice left (especially to a man already in ill health)
and has resigned.

Now that the position of president is open it is
the ideal time to remedy the situation caused by the
growth of these two areas by establishing two separate
posts for the two separate but necessary positions.

ore and more small colleges are turning to this meth-
od to solve this same problem— it is, in fact, the only
solution to the problem.

It is clear that Davidson, especially with its new
program of academic expansion and the increase of
fund solicitations such a program entails, will have to
face this solution in the near future. Now is the best
opportunity to establish these dual posts, and it must
be taken.

The idea at Davidson is not completely a new one.
Dr, McGavock mentioned it last week after Dr. Mar-

ncement of his resignation, and THE DA-
VIDSONIAN suggested it in an editorial. It has been
discussed, especially among some faculty and admin-
istration members for some time. This is the time to
implement it.

The plan is simple: to retain the post of president
of the college and to establish another post, that of
dean or chancellor. The president would be respon-
sible for the direction of Davidson’s academic growth,
while the dean would take care of the fund raising
which makes the academic growth possible.

Both areas complement each other and both are
vital to the life of the college—so vital, in fact, that to
neglect either would mean not only Davidson's failure
to achieve her goal as being one of the best liberal arts
colleges in the nation, but also the probable death of
the college itself.

avidson has come a long way in the past ten
years under Dr. Martin, To keep from taking the nec-
essary and obvious step now would mean that his ef-
forts and the efforts of everyone else involved in Da-
vidson’s growth and future have been in vain.
