The Davidson cross country
team finished third in a four
way mini-conference meet held
here last Saturday morning.

Richmond edged Appalach-
ian for first, with Davidson in
third, four points ahead of
East Carolina. Scoring the
meet as duals, the results were
the same. The Wildcats trailed
Richmond 16-42 and Appala-
chian 17-39, while beating
ECU .26-29. The meet left
Davidson 2-3 for the season.

“That’s the first time we’ve
ever beaten ECU,’’ Coach
Sterling Martin commented.

“It was our first race of the
year at six miles, and I
thought the team did pretty
well,’’ he added.

placing eighth overall in 33:25.
‘“‘Horn ran exceptionally
well,”’ said Martin. ‘‘He look-
ed strong the whole way,”
added one of the runners.

Coty Pinckney was next for
Davidson, running 34:19 for
14th place overall. Fred Borch
was right behind, sprinting to
the finish just one second off
Pinckney. John Barksdale and
Zack Murrell rounded out the
‘Cats’ top five, with respective
times of 34:29 and 35:02.

The times did not compare
well with those from past
meets. Pinckney’s time was
more than two minutes over
his best from last year, while
fifth man on last year’s team
ran 34:17, 45 seconds ahead of
Murrell’s pace.

as a team this year, at least in
the first five places,’’ Martin
commented. ‘‘But we’re defin-
itely weaker in depth. Our
sixth man was almost two
minutes behind our fifth,’’ he
explained.

The same men have finished
in the top five for Davidson in
all four meets thus far. Senior
co-captain Bill Cole finished
sixth in the last meet, and
should be challenging for a
scoring spot in the next seve-
ral weeks, according to Mar-
tin.

The Wildcats travel to Lau-
rinburg this weekend for an
eight team meet which inclu-
des Pembroke, Campbell,
Lynchburg, and host St.*And-
rews. ‘‘Pembroke is a power-
house, and Lynchburg could
be tough,’’ Martin noted.

The Davidson club football |
team opened its season with a
hard fought 22-6 loss to UNC
last Friday evening at Chapel

Hill. °

‘ As usual the Cats matched
sporadic offense with aggres-
sive defense, ending with a

losing combination.

The Tar Heels struck early
on a 65-yard scoring drive late
as the

team
managed to wear down and
capitalize on a relatively in-

in the first quarter,
more experienced

experienced defensive line.

The Cat defense redeemed
itself later by blocking a punt
and rookie senior Alan Duncan
scooped tHe ball up for Dav-

idson’s line tally.

an admirable performance,
while spending much of the
first half on the Astro Turf.
‘ Running backs Bob Bishop

quick bursts. But gradually
the UNC defense slowed them
with agressive line play.

“We. played a finé game
against a very tough team,”’
said Stone, ‘‘and I think we
were mentally down for the N.
C. State game.”’

In the State game on Mon-
day, the Wildcats could mus-

The game was _ scoreless
most of the way, with neither
team looking particularly im-
pressive on offense.

Stone was understandably
disappointed with the team’s
performance, but expressed
optimism for the future.

“We've played some very
tough teams, but that’s what
we wanted to do,” he said.
“All of the game could have
gone either way. I am glad we
have a week to reorganize be-
fore our next game.”
