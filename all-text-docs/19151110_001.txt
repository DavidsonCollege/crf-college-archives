Sophs Defeat Fresh But Lose to
Jrs.---Srs. Defeat ors. °

During the past week three games in
class basket ball, were staged. On No-
vember 4 a fast game was played by the
Sophs and Juniors, in which the Sophs
suffered their first defeat by a score of
17 to 15. At the end of the first half the
score was 14 to 1! in favor of the Jun-
iors. The second half was much closer.
the guarding on both sides being co per-
fect that neither team had many attempts
at goals, and in reality only one field
goal was made on each side. Barnett.
for the Sophs, played an unusually fast
game, and Murray. for the Juniors, add
ed splendid goal shooting to his usual
good guarding. The winning goal was
thrown by Young in the last few sec-
onds of play. ‘The line-up is as follows:

Juniors (17) Position Sophs (15)

In the second game of the week.

nlaved Monday morning, the Sophs de
feated the Fresh in a rather one-sided
vame by the score of 23 to 12. The
game was not as fast as. some of the
others plaved, but King, for the Saphs,
kept up his usual good record for shoot
‘ng goals. The line-up is as follows: |

In perhaps the fastest and hardest
fought game vet plaved the Seniors de-
feated the Juniors Monday afternoon
by the close score of 16 to 1§. The game
was hatly contested throughout, and the
Seniors carried off the victory with a
scant margin. There were no stars, or
rather every man was a star. for each
plaver seemed to put his whole being
into the game with the grim determina-
tion'to win. In this game also, the win-
ning goal was thrown almost at the end
of the game. Although the Jimiors did
not win the game, they deserve the high-
est praise for the splendid fight thev put
up against the heavier team, and the
fast passing and blocking which thev
featured. At the end of the first half
the score was 7 to 6 in favor of the

Pres. Currell Promises |Davidson the Winner

Athletic Investigation; In Game With Furman

Farther Light Thrown on Cancel-
lation of Carolina Game.

Much interest has been created
throughout the South on account of the
recent disclosures of irregularities in ath
letics at the University of South Caro
lina. Rumors which fad been circu-
lated have been substantiated in certain
cases, according to the statement of Pres
ident Currell, of the University, and a
thorough investigation is under way to
find just how many of the reports are
true.

‘The Clemson ‘Tiger, in a recent issue,
just after the Clemson-Carolina game.
calls attention to the face that several
men on the Carolina team had myster
iously appeared just at the proper mo
ment. declaring on their “honor” that
they had never attended college betore.
and then have developed within a day
into-finished foot ball players. “Vhat the
names and pictures of certain of these

‘Tmen had appeared in Spalding’s Oficial

Foot Ball Guide for 1912, as members
of acollege team, and vet these self same
men had never attended college, accord
ing to their own certificate.

By the rule of the University of South
Carolina, which states: “No student
who has taken part in an tatercollegiate
contest of a foot ball or base ball team
of another college arcuniversity shall be
permitted ta become a member of cithes
team of this university during his first
session,” these men were clearly incligi
ble, and the full disclosures as to the real
standing of all the plavers is awaited
with much interest,

Much of this information was alreads
in the hands of the Davidson Athletic
Committee, of which Dr J. Wo. Me
Connell is chairman. but) same of the
facts are.entirely new. Tt is especially
interesting to the students and alumni of
Davidson just at this time on account of
the necessity for the recent cancellation
of the game which was scheduled with
Seuth Carolina, and would seem ta ex
plain the round-about methad ins which
the South Carolina authorities endeav
ored to have this game plaved, when
they were not willing to abide by their
own contract, signed an May 10, 19065.
over one month after their catalogue
was published, which contained the rule
quoted ahove.

This contract specifically states, un-
der Article VT. that “No student who
is not a bona fide student of said college
shall be eligible, and must also be elig
ihle under their own respective college
athletic rules.” The list which was re-
ceived from the University of South
Carolina, at the very last minute, con-
tains the names of men who are clearly
not eligible, though never once have the
Davidson authorities asked that any one
man or men be ruled off; onlv that the
group as a whole be declared eligible.

The failure to stage the game was
very much regretted by all the friends
of the two institutions, but when the
facts have become known, all lovers of
true sport, including many alumni of the
University, have expressed themselves as
heing glad that the conditions were
shown in their true light, which may
he summed up in the refusal of anv
member of the faculty of the South

Easy Victory for Red and Black
by Score of 58 to 13.

Long end runs by C. Walker and
Black, and well executed forward passes
which counted for appreciable gains,
were the features of the game Saturday,
and, in large measure, accounts for the
58 to 13 score which the Red and Black
were able to roll up against the Furman
eleven. “Fhe two touchdowns of the
visitors came in the second and fourth
quarters, when the second team had
been substituted for the Varsity. Against
the Varsity, Furman failed to develop
an offensive which at any time would
endanger Davidson's goal.

Although scored on freely, Furman
putiap a plucky defense, often tackling
the Davidson runner when he seemed
destined for a touchdown. — Davidson,
making downs with regularity, punted
verv little.

A 35 vard end run by Black, a line
buck by Baird and a recovery of a fum-
ble by Savad behind the goal accounts
for Davidson's first touchdown, A 25-
vard gain through the line and a for-
ward pass, Lawson to Younger, brought
Davidson her second touchdown. Beau-
tiful 30 and ta-yard end runs by C.
Walker resulted in’ wo more touch-
downs and allowed the Reward Back
taend the first quarter with a 26-yo
score, NN

Second string men were substituted in
the second quarter. ‘Vhe fumbling of a
punt by McAlister. allowed the visitors
to reach Davidson's to yard line, A
succession of line plays resulted in’ a
touchdown for Furman. A: spectacular
run of 70 yards by Hill and Dean's line
buck of 5 yards accounts for Davidson's
only touchdown in the second quarter,

The recovery of a punt by R. Walker
behind Furman’s goal and end runs by
C. Walker and Black netted three
touchdowns'‘in the third quarter.

In the fourth quarter, aavell executed
forward pass, Jeter to Drake, netted go
vards for Furman and gave them a good
Opportunity to score their second touch-
down, King. a Davidson second team
man, scored the last touchdown for Dav-
idson, the final score standing, David-
