‘ THE DAVIDSONIAN

At first, I loved him for his sar-
casm. Later, I loved him for his
dedication to the cause. In the end,
though, I loved him for his ability
to deal with adverse conditions,
for the way he accepted loss and
decided to be even stronger then he
had been before the accident.

He had three dreams that
spring: play varsity soccer, drive a
Jeep, and go to the prom. On
Monday, they all came true. He
made the varsity team, was asked
to the prom by a junior girl, and
found a Jeep in the driveway when
he got home from school. On
Wednesday, everything changed.

It was raining, enough for him
to put the top back on but not
enough to stop him from driving.
And in a few moments time, he
rear-ended someone, got out of the
car to inspect the damage, and
found himself flying over four lanes

MONDAY, OCTOBER 3, 1994 9

To shrug at tragedy

of traffic until landing in the fast

lane without his right leg. A U.S. -

Marine stopped him just as he was
attempting to stand up and go after
his Jeep, a ball of flames on the
interstate.

The days in the hospital turned
into weeks. I would sit with him,
unsure of what I could say. At
times, he would cry out in pain. I
would cringe as he reached for the
leg that was not there. It was the
phantom pain I had always heard
amputees suffered after an acci-
dent. This pain, however, was
only a small part of his new reality.

He had grown up an athlete.
That chapter of his life closed just
as it had begun to turn full circle.
The life he had lived as a hand-

some, healthy, young man was no
more. He had a barrier now, a
barrier far more massive then the
wheelchair he drove or the plastic
leg he owned. Would spirit or
injury win the battle?

I braced myself. First, there
would be anger, I reasoned. Fear
and a sense of loss would follow.
Finally, he would reach acceptance.
I understood this all because I was
angry. I was angry at the rain that
caused the accident, the man who
forced him to check for damage,
the driver who pinched off his leg,
the nurses who couldn’t stop his
pain—and most of all by this fate
that had the changed his future.

Future, however, is often de-

into it, but by the factors you pull
out of it. His prom was in the
hospital room; they danced sitting
in his wheelchair together. His
tuxedo was pinned up where
“Timmy, the stump” ended, and
dinner was take-out instead of hos-
pital food.

Anger, fear, and loss aren’t
necessary when tragedy strikes, I
learned. In the days we spent to-
gether in the hospital, I never saw
him cry or question or speak out in
anger. He lost his leg, and he
accepted it. He had changed ana-
tomically, but it never meant he
had to change emotionally.

We went on a walk in the
hospital parking lot the day after
his prom. A small girl walked by

as I was pushing his wheel chair

-and stared at his stump.

“Say ‘Hi,’ Timmy,” he said,
and waved the amputated leg ob-
noxiously. The girl’s eyes opened
wide and she looked away.

I questioned him. Why scare
a small girl so needlessly?

“T can handle this loss,” he
said. “It doesn’t scare me or anger
me or change me. I can handle this,
but maybe the next guy can’t and
that little girl stares at him and it
destroys him. Maybe I just kept
that from happening. I can’t fight
for the ball anymore, bufIcan fight
for what I believe in—that I, or
anyone else, am no different with-
out a leg. Iam no weaker, no more
helpless, no less human. In fact, I
am stronger and more human be-
cause I have seen tragedy and
shrugged at it.”

Toward frank and open honesty

Channel from page 8

don’t have the capacity to think on
a higher plain when reading my
articles, I suggest you skip them
the next time you pick up The
Davidsonian. Because, without a
doubt, I will continue to write in
the same manner that I always have.

WhileI am talking about reac-
tions to my articles, I would like to
thank John Rogers for his little
history lesson last week. But, I
must also warn him that not all
logical thinking is based on litera-
ture that is printed in black and
white or etched in stone on the side
of some mountain.

I am proud to see that Mr.
Rogers has extensive knowledge
in certain areas. But, I can assure
him that African-Americans have
read the same books and have at-
tended the same classes that he
has, so we know all about the
“facts” he mentioned last week.
So trust me when I say that we
have a pretty firm grip on the his-
tory of this “great” country of ours.

And I still say, through some very
logical thinking, that I still associ-
ate hate and slavery with that flag.
I am sure that somewhere during
your studies you noticed that sla-
very was in effect before the Civil
War, ended with the war, and would
have been prolonged had the Con-
federacy won. Regardless -if it
started the war or not, the connec-
tions are pretty damn obvious.

I believe Ralph Ellison best.

stated the need for frank and open
honesty: ‘Whence all this com-
passion toward conformity any-
way?—diversity is the word. Let
man keep his many parts and you’ Il
have no tyrant states ... America is
woven of many strands ... Our feat
is to become one, yet many ... Thus
one of the greatest jokes in the
world is the spectacle of the whites
busy escaping blackness and be-

“coming blacker every day, and the

blacks striving towards whiteness
becoming quite dull and gray.

None of us seems to know who he

is or where he is going.”

_ cided not by the factors you play

Le us not drink from the cup of bitterness.

The resounding eee overthe
institution of slavery is a victory
black Americans will carry proudly
through centuries to come—and
justly so. While emancipation and
the struggle for civil rights repre-
sent major benchmarks in the his-
tory of that success, the undeniable
disadvantage blacks find them-
selves at today reminds us we have
much to learn as a nation.
Unfortunately, Ike Bailey’s
extremist theory of aslow

blatantly defies the wisdom of these
words and tears at the achieve-
ments of one of our nation’s great-
est men. Whefh one component of
a society repeatedly alienates an-
other, there can be no hope for
legitimate integration. As a na-
tion, we have learned this lesson
all too well. This was the unfortu-
nate case in the 1800’s. This was
the unfortunate case in the 1960's.
Now, in 1994, Ike Bailey has re-

well be the least appropriate means
to further the cause of black Ameri-
cans today. Ike’s article, justifi-
ably quick to recall painful images
of slavery and injustice, completely
ignores the progress our nation has
made. Do not forget that it was the
United States of America that took .
the first steps toward establishing
the long-deserved American birth-
right of freedom for all men. Do
not forget that the United States of

and collective forced ex-
tinction of black Ameri-
cans does little to further
this cause. In fact, I
would be remiss not to
mention that articles of
Ike’s nature do little more
than act as powerful kill-
ing forces themselves.

This country is something we
should all love. It's all we

have. in moments of strife—

and that's a lot more than the
people of most nations can

even pray for.

America struggled to
give equal rights to its
minority. citizens. .. Do
not forget thatthe United
States of America pro-
vided troops that ensured
the safety of Martin
Luther King’s March on
Washington. In re-
sponse to your question,

Incessant comparison of
America in 1800 to America in
1994, two vastly divergent nations,
achieves no positive result.
Conversely, Ike creates an at-
mosphere of bitter animosity in
which the noble intent of the ar-
ticle is destroyed by a stinging
rhetoric characteristic of the
1960’s. Weare not presented with
a motivational cause to rally
around; rather, we are exposed to

-the venting of emotion that smacks

of segregation anew.

On August 28, 1963, uttered
in the shadow of the immortal
words, “I have a dream,” Martin
Luther King urged his followers,
“Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst
for freedom by drinking from the
cup of bitterness.” Ike’s article

vived alienation and squelched 30
years of progress towards racial
harmony.

As an American, I am not
proud of the history my nation
tolerated in regard to slavery and
racial injustice. This sentiment, I
assure you, is shared by the major-
ity of our country’s people. Scat-
tered, racist factions indeed exist
within our society. However, this
diminishing minority weakens
daily. The forces striving to pro-
mote racial equality are far greater
than those tearing it down. De-

spite Bailey’s article, I am confi-. -

dent this trend will continue to-
morrow.

Verbal indictment of the
United States of America could

this country is something
we should all love. It’s all we have
in moments of strife—and that’s a
lot more than the people of most
nations can even pray for.
The concluding paragraphs of
Bailey’s article highlight the
achievements of professional and
artistic blacks in our society today.
These are the images we need to
portray—not just to the doubting
white population, but to the dis-
couraged black population as well.
Only by positive example will we,
as a nation, overcome the igno-
rance that finds itself at the roots of
racism. Tearing one culture down
to build another inexorably leads
to ruin. This is the mistake too
many Americans made long ago.
History need not repeat itself.

Political success despite a questionable past is trendy

name” Kennedy, whose past is
horrible. A wild party man and
womanizer, he consistently wins
his Massachusetts’ Senate seat.
Finally, this year, he is leading

.only slightly in the polls.

These men are just a few ex-
amples. Bob “I’m-sorry-to- bump-
into-you” Packwood, Jesse “Af-
firmative-Action-is-my-pal”
Helms, and to some degree, Bill
“J-need-a-cheap-lawyer” Clinton
are all examples of political suc-
cess despite questionable beliefs

or pasts. Even Oliver North, a self-
admitted liar, is in position to win
the Virginia Senate race.

It’s not a black or white thing;
it is a Republican and Democratic
thing, and it does seem to be a male
thing. I’m not saying each and
every elected official should be
Mother Theresa, but there should
be alimit. Our founders designed
the Constitution on hopes that an
“educated” public would take part
in the government to benefit all.
Remember, the ultimate check to
any elected official is us, the vot-
ers.

In college we are educated, so
our votes will probably be care-
fully thought out and made. Un-
fortunately, this is not true for a
large majority of people. Unless
our society as a whole changes, the
government will noteither. Iknow-
that I might be talking a little dras-
tically, but when you really think
about it, quite a few shady charac-
ters énter politics. I just thought
the Barry election rocked the boat,
not the vote.

Maybe Gary Hart is a pretty
smart guy. Don’t remember him
very well? That’s the reason why.
