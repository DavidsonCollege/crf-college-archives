Forty-seven of the 126 students who
graduated from Davidson College last
May, or 37 per cent of the membership,
are continuing their studies in a doz-
en or more institutions, according to a
tentative survey made by Ernest Mil-
ton, alumni secretary, and announced
here-last week.’

This report has led to the belief that
more Davidson students are con-
tinuing their studies after graduation
than ever before, for it was stated by
the secretary that a number of other
graduates were teaching a year prior |
to further educational preparation.

The report showed an unusual ex-
odus of Davidson graduates to*north-
ern institutions, Ten 1928 men have
enrolled at Harvard, principafly in the |
business and medical departments, and
others will attend Columbia Univer- |
sity, George Washington and the Uni- |
versity of Pennsylv&nia.

Southern institutéons in which Da-

vidson is represented by last year’s
graduates are the University of North

Medical College of Virginta, Unive
sity, Medical College of Virginia, Un
versity of Georgia and Union and Co-
lumbia Seminaries. When the survey
is completed, it is thought that other |
colleges and universities will be added_|
to this list.

The Secretary stated that besides
the 12 institutions mentioned above
he knew offhand that other Davidson
graduates are studying at
Yale, Boston Tech, New York Univer-
sity, Princeton, University of Arkan-
sas, Jefferson Medical College, Univer-
sity of Maryland, Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity—both medical and academic—
University of Alabama, Duke Univer-

GREENVILLE ALUMNI

NEXT FRIDAY NIGHT)

First Local Alumni Gathering of |
Fall Season—Lively Meeting |
Expected

The first local alumni meeting is
scheduled to be held at Greenville, S.
C,,'Friday night, September 28th, when
alumni in that city and surrounding
section will meet at a banquet to be
given in the Woodside Grill at 7:30
o'clock. Approximately 75 Davidson
alumni reside in that immediate sec-
tion.

This meeting has been arranged on
the night preceding the Clemson-Da-
vidson football clash on Saturday, and
for that reason the gathering is ex-
pected to be particularly lively and
peppy. Former Davidson students re-
siding. in Greenville, Greer, Easley,
Fountain Inn, Pelzer, Clemson College,
Pickens and Traveler’s Rest have all
been extended invitations—both by of-
ficers of the Greenville association and
the alumni office here.

In the temporary absence of the
president, Mr. F. K. Spratt, ’o4, the
preliminary arrangements have been
in charge of the vice-president, Mr.
John I, Smith, ’24. Mr. Spratt is ex-
pected to be in Greenville for the meet-
ing and will preside. Rev. E, P. Davis,
D.D., ’73, is secretary-treasurer of that
organization. Ernest Milton, alumni
| secretary, will attend.

ing rules: Do not talk to any man who

is a member of a fraternity that is bid-
ding you until the period of silence is
over. This does not include talking over
the situation with some other fraternity
| man or with some non-fraternity man,

| The program for Friday night will be:
After 7:00 o'clock, beginning at that
| hour and continuing at half an hour in-
| tervals, representatives from each bidding

is desirous of joining any of the inviting
fraternities he should go to the house of
that fraternity and inform them that he
accepts their bid.

Aiter a reasonable time has passed
there will follow custom that is peculiar
to the Davidson campus. Men from each
fraternity will visit around to meet the
pledges of the other fraternities. This
has been the custom ever Since the fra-
ternities have been on the campus. This
is done in a spirit of friendliness and also
in what might be called a spirit of curios-

| ity to see the men and to meet them.

The local fraternities, although not

been accustomed in the past to accept the
Bid-
day and period of silence will be observed
by the locals, and their bids will be mailed
along with the national fraternity bids.

Rushing season for the fraternities this
year is much shorter than it has ever
been at Davidson. . Formerly the season
extended until just before the Christmas
holidays. For the four years the season

+-has~brencut down gradually until it has

reached its present shortness. Four years
ago bid-day was around the middle of
December, three years ago it came on the
5th’ of November, last year it was during
the last of October, and this year it has
been put in the last of September, Septem-
ber 28, making an open season of exactly
two weeks from the time that school
| ojens. In thus reducing the length of the
season Davidson is falling into line with
|many of the universities, most of whom
have seasons lasting about a week. This
| gradual change has been made not from
la sense of following larger schools. but
| from the belief that a shorter season is
|not as hard on the studies of the Fresh-
| man or the upper-classman. It is the be-
| lief of many of the observers*of the fra-

any time shorter than two weeks will not |
enable the Freshman to know the men in
the fraternities or will it allow men rush-

argument that is used is that with such a
short season the rushing is very heated
and that with a-shorter season too much
of a cut-throat competition would enter.

War Department Recognized
Him Ten Years After War
Ended

IS JACKSONVILLE LAWYER

An unusual incident which attracted
nation-wide attention was the recent
award of the Distinguished Service
Cross to Mr. Henry C. Martin, ’15, of
Jacksonville, Fla. It was unusual in
the fact that this recognition was made
ten years after the cessation of hos-
tilities.

The war department’s first an-
nouncement was made July 31, and
since that time the medal has been
officially presented with appropriate
ceremonies at Jacksonville. In com-
menting upon this honor, The Jack-
sonville (Fla.) Journal stated the dis-
patch from Washington said:

“The war department’s award was
given for bravery when Mr. Martin,
then a second lieutenant in the 47th
Infantry, near Bavouches, France,
August 7-9, 1918, was ordered with his
platoon to cross the Vesle river and,
finding no bridge, he swam the river
under heavy fire, stretched ropes and
improvised a .pontoon structure for
his platoon to cross. He also rescued
two of his men who were endangered
by the swift current while crossing.
Two days later, when his company
commander was wounded, he placed
himself at the head of the most ex-
posed unit and led it forward in a de-
termined attack on Bazouches.”

Regarding Mr. Martin’s service, the
Davidson College War Record said:
“He enlisted April 6, 1917, and was ap-
pointed second lieutenant in the reg-

ular army, October 26, 1917. Com-
pleted course at Army Service Schools,
Fort Leavenworth, Kans.

Mr. Martin has been a resident of
Jacksonville for several years and is
known as one of the most able and

popular members of the Duval bar.

uate, He is Keenly Interested
in Davidson

Mr. Harold C, Smith, ’14, an attor-
ney at Rockville, Md., was unanimous-
ly chosen commander of the Mary-
Department of the American
Legion at the annual meeting of that
organization held recently at Cum-
berland, Md.

At the same time he was elected |

state delegate to attend the national
convention of the American Legion in
San Antonio, Texas, next month. Un-
less something intervenes, he plans to
attend this meeting. He has been in-
vited to visit Davidson en route to, or
from, the convention.

Mr. Smith entered Davidson from
Rockville, Md., in the fall of 1912 and

Davidson Alumni Chosen
Commander of Maryland
Post of American Legion

remained here only one year. He
went to the University of Texas, where
he obtained his degree in law. After
practicing a while in that state he re-
turned ‘to his original home and has
been practicing in Rockville for some
time. His civilian life was interrupted
when he joined the army, and he
served Uncle Sam in the 17th Infantry
of the Lafayette division.

Although he is not a graduate of
Davidson, Mr. Smith is keenly inter-
| ested in the institution, and is an active
{member of the Washington, D, C., Al-
umni Association. He is prominent
}and popular in Rockville, and in May,
| 10927, he was a layman delegate to the
| General Assembly“of the Presbyterian
| Church at El Dorado, Ark. On his re-
turn north he visited Davidson and

| was impressed with the many changes

| made during the past few-years.
