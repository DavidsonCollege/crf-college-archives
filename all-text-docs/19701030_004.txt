Almost Losers

When the trustees acted to change the David-
son social system three weeks ago they acted, or so
all their statements indicated, in a positive sense.

Official rhetoric since that time has also had
this concern with meaningful c es and oppor-
tunities for new s of social affiliation.

Unfortunately in spite of all this concern and
rhetoric, the real losers in the transition during the
very immediate future might have been the tresh-
men, supposedly the beneficiaries of the changes,
were it not for a few recent changes made almost
in concession to them. z

Two factors in immediate developments were
combining against the interests of the freshmen.
First, the composition of the committee to effect
the changes did not include any representatives of
the freshman class.

The freshmen should be represented on _ this

oup because the change will most affect them.

hey should be represented as the only group never
to experience life under the old tem.

- And finally they should be represented because
it is time this college Jearned to work in its decision
making with free exchange between all responsible
parties to the decision and with all parties.in open
and immediate contact.

It had been argued that to pick freshmen as
freshmen for the committeé would be to give them
undue’ status as a separate group in the college,
but their special interests demand that they be re-
presented withouf académic distinctions as to their
proper position on campus. The day of keeping the
Student in his place has passed.

It had also been argued that the freshmen can
make their Wishes adequately heard by speaking
to any official member of the committee outside of-
ficial_ meetings.

Unfortunately that is an administration ploy

with which anyone who was a member of the student

senate last spring is all too familiar. Excluding any
involved party from deliberations conce “their
situation precludes the fairness of those deliberations.

Fortunately the oversight has been corrected
and hopefully with it the spirit which led to the
mistake. Yet of equal danger to the freshmen were
the plans to involve them in rush, bidding, and initia-
tion before the final social changes were instituted.

This problem too may -have been resolved in
the discussions of the week with the plans“by the
fraternities to hold open house but no rush until
the final nature of impending changes is made clear.
Until these changes ‘are clear, the freshmen would
be well advised to eschew any fraternity plans to
al them in commitments with an uncertain fu-
ure. wos. S

With the many problems ahead in these areas
it is vital for both sides to maintain their sense of
perspective toward these issues. For if viewed from
the proper distance these coming changes can be
accomplished without rancor or serious discord. 'The
problems involved should be settled without serious
bitterness being aroused in anyone. They are not
worth that price. =T

Notes Without Comment

_ In a situation not unusual to journalists of any
stripe, your editors found themselves late Tuesday
night with space.to fill and nothing to fill it with.
Realizing that most editorial writing is half air, we
decided that some things really need no comment.
A quick survey of a prominent local newspaper yield-
ed the following gems:

Pessimism And Pollyanna

for this year’s Pollyanna
Award, | ask that the Com-
mittee consider one hard
question: Could our prob-
lems be the result. of faculty
perception as well as “real”
inequities, injustices, etc.?

If one looks at the slogans
which have capsulized the
goals _of our government
over the last forty years,
we have made ourselves
some hefty promises.

Never satisfied with the
status quo (admittedly, Sat-
isfaction was a hard thing
fo come by in the Depres-
sion), we have continually
promised ourselves a better
world.

Through the New Deal,
Fair Deal, New (Frontier,
and Great Society, we. not
only admitted our shortcom-
ings; but hinted at their
eradication.

We didn’t ‘just deplore the
existence of hunger, illiter-
acy and poverty, we vowed
to wage war on them.

Few would deny that these
were, and are noble goals.
Yet, for all our grand de-
signs, Utopia has somehow
eluded us.

Is the situation which con-
fronts us at present. It Is
natural that a pepulace
which has been conditioned
to expect both possession
and mastication of the pro-
verbial cake will expect
nothing less than that.

And so, to «answer our
hard question, it seems very
likely that a latge> part ‘of
our troubled situation is the
result of an ever-increasing

cannot be fulfilled.

The conclusion to be drawn
