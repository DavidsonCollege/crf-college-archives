What do herbs have to do with
relationships?

Davidson artist Laura Grosch
explores the relationships between
the parts of her paintings in aseries
of eight acrylic painting entitled
“Herbs,” which is now on display
at the Christa Faut Gallery, The
paintingsare not only about differ-

ent herbs, but about packers
In the September) eof
Lake Norman’ ipa. ine, Gtdsch_

was quoted ‘as« saying that her
images are about the-relationship
between the herbin the foreground
and whatshe calls the cutout in the
background. According to Lake
Norman Magazine , these cutouts
are intricate patterns originated in
Europe as t¢mporary decorations,
similar to the paper snowflakes
children cut out. After carefully
choosing the cutout that would best.
match the herb, Giosch painted the
herb first and then thie background.
Each of the ight j paintings,
“Thyme,” “Basil,” “Dill,” “Lav-

ender,” “Lamb's. Ear,” “Spear-__cuto
mint,” “Italian Parsley,” and “Bee -

Balm” have unique qualities, and
would be capable of standing with-
out the others, but the paintings in

series are incredible. All the paint-
ings share vivid colors including
countless shades of greens.

“Thyme” gives a feeling of the
sun shining on leaves by using
both bright and light orange in the
background witha mixture of solid
and multicolored leaves.

In “Basil,” the colors are vivid,
and the plant rises out of the sun.
There is a great contrast between
the background and the herb.

. “Lavender,” my shaal fa-
vorite, employs bright red’ and
purple for the background; the
actual flower is only at the top. The
painting reminds me of a lazy
summer afternoon in a wide open
field; a marked contrast from the
brightness and: vividness of the
colors.

“Lamb’s Ear” is the only paint-
ing which docs not use bright col-
ors. Instead, Grosch uses pastel

pinks and greens. The hérb and the:

restofthe background appear to be
a frame for a central and elaborate
cutout.

In “Spearmint, ” the herb is to-
tally distinct from the background,
as if it was painted on. In its detail
and colors, though, it is reminis-

cent of a fine tapestry.

In “Italian Parsley,” the -herb
meshes with its background, at the
same time remaining distinct. “Bee
Balm” uses a variety of unique
colors that normally one does not
see together, but here they match
perfectly.

In the Lake Norman Magazine,
Groschemphasized the importance
of getting the positive and nega-
live space between the image cor-

particular cutout she plans to use.

She likens the paintings to a
~ symphony made up of many dif-

ferent parts--it is difficult to sepa-
rate all the different instruments,
instead, one hears all of the levels
together. Likewise, in her paint-
ings, it is difficult to separate the
background from the foreground.

For me, the paintings were
wonderful and I could have stayed
in the gallery for hours, but for
someone else, of course, they may

-bedifferent. Goto the Christa Faut

ber 14, and the gallery hours are

Rob Kelley | Inside Charlotte
Festival in the Park Returns

This week marks the return of
Charlotte’s annual Festival in the
Park in wooded Freedom Park.

Now in its twenty-sixth year,
the festival had to close early last
year on account of high winds:
high winds that became Hurricane
Hugo by the end of that week.

As lights swing on long strings
beneath brightly colored tents, ven-
dors will show their crafts: metal-
worked earrings, carved wooden
flutes, tie-dye t-shirts, and more.
Music (in the park band shell,) will
range from the Charlotte. Folk
Society (Thursday, 6:30,) to the
Oratorio Singers, (Saturday, 7:30).
Dance acts, also in the shell, will
include cloggers and Polynesian
Dancers as well as more modern

styles. Finally, one entire section
of the park will be devoted to an art
exhibit by various area painters.
The Festival started on Tues-
day, and it will continue through-
out the week. On the weckdays,
the activities will begin around6:00
pm and close at 10:00. The cele-
brations will also be open Satur-

‘ day and Sunday, from 2:00 p.m.

until 6:00. Admission is free, and
you can call the festival office at
532-1060 for more details.
Freedom Park is located pretty
deep within Charlotte. Toget there,
take:I-77 south to Brookshire (the
south fork,) get off at the
Kenilworth exit, and turn right at
the base. Follow that road through
four stoplights, veering off to the

right when it forks itself into two
one-way avenues. At the base of
the hill, the road will merge back
together and curve left. Another
road will curve right. Go LEFT.
At the second stoplight, you’ll
see Charlotte Catholic High
School, my alma mater, on you
right, Turn left there onto the side-
street, and the park will be over the
rise of the nexthilland on yourleft.
You'll probably have to park on a
another. side-street, especially if
you go at night (the best time).
To return to Davidson, simply
retrace yoursteps. Turn rightat the
CCHS stoplight, right again at the
one-way split, and follow

Kenilworth until you sce a large .

The Incredible Ease of
Well Being

What is Aerobic Exercise?

Marlo Cobb

“Regular acrobic exercise” can
be translatcd into “voluntary stress
which prepares the body for invol-
untary stresses.” The fact is, hu-
man beings aren’t meant to be
sedentary animals, and there are a
plethora(SAT word) of benefits to
be gained by exercise. One great
thing about the human body is that
is amazingly resilient. No matter
how old, overweightor just “outof
shape” you are, you can bounce
back with exercise.

Unlike stress put on an inani-

* mate object which makes it bend

and eventually break, the “volun-

tary stress” you put on yourself by

exercising can only make you

stronger and more resistant to

breaking down. Active people live

11-15 percent longer than people

who are couch potatoes all their

lives. . wat
Exercise:

1. Improves cardiovascular fitness,

circulation and digestion

2. Raises your metabolic rate

3. Strengthens bones: without

exercise, muscles atrophy and

stiffen

4. Promotes a general upswing in

mood, heightened self-image and

decreased stress

5. Strengthens the immunc system
The official definition of “acro-

bic exercise” is raising your heart

- rate, (the number of beats per
rect, butshe always has ingpghe ; minute,)to60-85 percentcapaeity!

anid Keeping it there for 20 16°40
minutes or more. Youcafi measure

your own pulse to make sure you
are doing this. Simply put, for a
six-second count, your heart should
be bealing somewhere between 13
and 17 times, varying by age and
fitness level.

You should work out at least
three times per week. The best
time of day tocxcercise is whenever
you feel like it and whenever you
have time. However, until it gets
cooler, don’t go running between
11 a.m. and 3 p.m. 1 hate sccing
people on the track then; I’m afraid
they’re going to drop dead.

Also, remembcr nottocatfor 1
to 2 hours beforchand, If you must
eat then, make it somcthing small,
with no fat and no sugar. Bread,
pasta or fruit arc: fine. The best
thing after a workout is water-not
Gatorade!

Enough rulcs. I uscd to think
of the need to exercise asa horrible
guilt trip under which I sweated
through an hour of gym so that I
could go to lunch next petiod and
not fecl so bad. Believe me, it
docsn’t have to be that way.

Remember when you were a

kid? Exercise wasn’t “exercise”:
exercise was “playing”. Now that
you’ re (sort of) grown up, if you
don’t find running fun, don’tdo it.
Do something different that you
enjoy. Anything is better than
nothing at all. Try tcnnis, shoot

clusion, while Hamrick maintains
that being off-campus “makcs it

fecls that she has no constant con-
tact with people on campus.
Ruff, like Vandcrford, likes
living off-campus. bettcr for be-
cause of the independence it of-
fers. She enjoys having her own
room, and. cooking in her kitchen.

___ These_transfers all look for-

“ward to making the most of the
opportunities that Davidson offers.
Ruff, an English major, is cnjoy-
ing the academics at Davidson, the

‘smaller environment as compared

to a larger university, and her pro-
fessors, whom she says are “so
wonderful” and “talk to you per-
sonally.” “Absolutely fascinated”
with physical anthropology right
now, Lorenzin, an anthropology
major, is looking forward to taking
a Basic Drawing course, Creative
Writing, and more anthropology
in the future.

Vanderford, now at his ROTC

» headquarters here at Davidson, is

“anxious Lo get into my major”,
political scicnce. He is especially
cager to take courses in Constitu-
tional Law. He addcd that he is
“glad to be in a placc that people
are proud to be in and cata
to graduate from.’

Hamrick is considering a
Centcr for Special Studies major
combining political science, an-
thropology, and religion, enjoying
“conversations with students who
have different perspectives than I
have,” and finding academics “not
just challenging on an intellectual
Icvel, butalso ona personal level.”

While these transfers are en-
thusiastic about gaining from their
experience at Davidson, they are
also adding to others’ experiences
at Davidson, bringing diversity,
energy, and a thirst for knowledge
with them onto campus and into
the classroom.
