Beyond Davidson: International News

By BETH DRUMMOND and
CAROL GATEWOOD
VENEZUELA: More than 300
people are dead after nearly a week
of rioting in the streets of Caracas
and other Venezuelan cities. The
nationwide backlash occurred af-
ter newly elected President Carlos
Andres Perez imposed the first
steps of an austerity program to
stabilize the country’s sagging
economy. Among other measures,
the plan raised prices before an
agreement could. be reached on
private sector wage increases to
offset them. Perez has been quick
to blame Venezuela’s economic
ills on its $33 billion foreign
debt—a figure which has in-
creased dramatically since the
world fall in oil prices in the late

Tripp Helms: First unopposed SGA

By MARGARET CARROLL
Last week the SGA announced

final category III election results,

which signify a first in Davidson’s
history: an unopposed SGA presi-
dential race. Junior Tripp Helms,
new SGA president said, “Al-
though I was unopposed in the
race, I feel qualified for the job and
am excited about the upcoming
year.”

Chalmers Davidson, college
archivist and professor emeritus of
history, said that he “cannot finda
record of anyone unopposed in the
past” and that he “thinks it is won-
derful that there is so much agree-
ment among the students” to find
someone: for ‘such’ an importaiit
job. °

The former SGA president, sen-
ior Harrison Murray, reports that
he knew of at least one person who
was seriously considering running
against Helms but did not, “know-
ing that it would be tough to beat
Helms.” Murray added that Helms
is the best qualified for the job,
which is why there was no opposi-
tion from anyone in the Senate.

“Tripp has made a name for
himself on this campus, being
highly respected among faculty,
administration, students and the
community as a whole,” Murray
said.

Murray hopes that Helms’ elec-.
tion will add continuity to the
SGA. Since Helms has served on
the Senate as an independent sena-
tor andas junior class president, he

MIDDLE EAST PEACE:

In Vienna where East/West con-
ventional arms talks are scheduled
to begin this week, Secretary of
State James Baker and Soviet For-
eign Minister Eduard Shevard-
naze are expected to discuss plans
for a new approach to Middle East
peacemaking. Baker is reportedly
developing a three—tract pro-
posal dedicated to Israel, the PLO
and the Soviet Union. Under this
plan, Israel would begin by negoti-
ating with Palestinians from the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip and
then branch out to include other
Arab states and the PLO. Baker
will encourage Moscow to aban-
don its idea of -an international
conference and to join the United

is familiar with past SGA projects
and concerns. Murray said that he
would be willing to help Helms in
any way, but that “it’s his show
now.”. Helms was sworn in on
Tuesday night.

Helms does hope to continue
many of the SGA’s projects from
this past year. He also “looks for-
ward to working with newly-
elected vice president junior Tim
Sparks, who brings experience to
the job, as he has served as chair-
man of the Ad Hoc phone commit-
tee and as independent senator.”

One of the issues that Helms
hopes to continue is the investiga-
tion into the semester system and
the amount of breaks. Helms
hopes to look into the possibility of
a 13 or 14 week semester.

The new SGA willalso continue
to improve campus lighting for the
students’ safety, and it will con-
tinue to investigate the new phone
system, making sure that it is best
serving the students.

A main area of concern for
Helms is the athletic situation.
Helms is especially concerned
with federal statute title 9 concern-
ing equal emphasis on women’s
and men’s sports. “A great stride
has been taken in the creation of a
women’s varsity soccer team, and
I hope to see more new women’s
sports added in the upcoming
years, along with swimming and
diving teams for both men and
women,” said Helms.

Helms also says that the SGA

Baker is expected to challenge the
Soviets to further prove their good
intentions by pushing to convince
PLO leader Yasir Arafat to allow
West Bankers and Gazans to take
the lead in negotiations.

TIBET: Ten pro-Tibetan inde-
pendence rioters were killed Mon-
day when Chinese police open
fired on a crowd of some 600 per-
sons. The incident was the fourth
violent protest in Tibet in the last
18 months and points to the grow-
ing strains between Tibetans who
favor independence and Bejing
authorities who are adamant that
the province remain Chinese. The
clash came on the first anniversary
of the killing of up to 24 pro-
independence. demonstrators dur-

will be closely. watching the foot-
ball transition to Division III and
making sure that the college main-
tains its commitment to Division I
in the other areas. Overall Helms
wants to try to re-emphasize
Davidson’s commitment to athlet-
ics in all sports.

Concerning the AIDS ciate
Helms said, “Although the SGA
has passed a resolution that sup-
ports the investigation of installing
condom machines, we intend to
receive more student feedback on
the issue before deciding the best
way to deal with the AIDS issue on
campus.”

‘The SGA will continue to inves-
tigate the availability of computers
and to fight the problem of noise
and food in the library.

Two broad issues that Helms
hopes to tackle are the minority
situation on campus and the direc-
tion that Davidson is headed as a
first-rate institution.

Helms hopes to create a new
committee expressly for the pur-
pose of examining the minority
situation. This committee will be
made up of some SGA senators but
mostly a wide cross-section of
students, and it will seek to better
the situation for minorities.

Concerning Davidson’s future, . .

Helms noted that the college is
going through many.changes right
now with the addition of new fa-
cilities, the fund drive; the investi-
gation into the size of the college,
and the athletic changes. “It is

ing the Tibetan New Year celebra-
tion. Official reports of this con-
frontation are sketchy as foreign
journalists have been denied ac-
cess to Tibet.

CONVENTIONAL REDUC-
TIONS: The Conventional
Forces in Europe talks which be-
gan this week in Vienna have been
billed by East and West as the best
chance ever to reduce the armies
that have faced each other across
the Iron Curtain since World War
II. For budgetary as well as strate-
gic reasons, both sides are eager to
cut back the number of troops,
tanks, artillery and other weapons
inEurope. After 15 years of failure
in previous negotiations, repre-
sentatives of 16 NATO countries
and seven Warsaw Pact countries

will begin discussions on the much
hoped-for reductions. U.S.
sources said NATO negotiators
were close to an agreement on the
final details of a proposal toreduce
the number of plain battle tanks in
Europe to equal levels of about
20,000 per side, to cut back on
other armored troop. carriers to
about 27,500 on each side and to
reduce artillery weapons to about
16,500 on each side. Such ceilings
would require cutbacks in NATO
forces of five to ten percent, but
would require massive cutbacks in
Warsaw Pact forces of over 50 per-
cent. U.S. officials are unsure as to
how the Soviets will respond to
these proposals. However, they
are confident that some form of
agreement can be reached.

important that the SGA has input
into the direction of the college,”
says Helms.

Overall Helms sees his role as
SGA president as actively involv-

ing all students in every possible
way to make Davidson a better
place. “The students have a real
potential to affect the future of
Davidson,” says Helms.

Tripp Helms: To some, he’s “Mr. President,” but to us at The
Davidsonian, our former News Editor is still “Chilly Willy.”
