Faculty team evaluates Humanities

By EMILY PARTIN
Staff Writer .

For the first time sirice Humanities
was instituted in the early 1960’s, all
the faculty connected with the pro-
gram met together this summer to
reevaluate its basic concepts.

Professor of Religion Daniel D.
Rhodes, Chairman of the first year
program, said, ‘‘This was not done
because we thought last year’s pro-
gram or the program to this point has
not been good; we really believe in it.
But we thought it could be better.”’

Team redefines Focus

To improve the course the team felt
it was important to define the focus of
the program. They decided to base
the program upon four relationships:
Man’s View of Himself, Man in
Society, Man and the Natural World,
and Man and the Divine.

This new focus resulted in a

revisiM of the stated goals of the
program. The objectives stated last
year were carried over to this year,
but there were a few additions.

These include ‘‘an awareness of the
varied understandings of human exis-
tence which have significantly influ-
enced the developement of western
civilization” and ‘‘a critical awareness
of the self within the environment and
of the implications of values and
goals.’’ These objectives reflect the
emphasis that seems to be placed this
year upon man’s relationship to
himself and his broader environment.

As a result of this ‘‘re-thinking”’ of
Humanities, the actual course of
study this year is somewhat different
from last year. The first year program
places more emphasis on art.

The literature of the Hellenistic and
Medieval periods will be stressed;
students will study some of Euripi-

des’ works, Greek lyrics, The Golden .

Ass, Parzival, and Augustine’s City
of God. There will be more Egyptian
material, and original histories, such

as Herodotus’ writings, will be read.
There will be a reduction in the
amount of Biblical material studied.

The second year program has also
been altered somewhat. There is
increased emphasis on religion and
philosophy. Students will be reading
some literature this year that was not
assigned last year.

For example, second year Humani-
ties will study Gargantua and Panta-
gruel by Rabelias, Phaedra'by Ra-
cine, and Beyond Freedom and Digni-
ty by Skinner. Students will not read
Don Quixote, Walden, or any of
Moliere’s plays.

For the first time, students are
being issued a handbook of supple-
mentary material. This handbook
provides the student with reading
selections used in the course, and
reduces the number of books he or she
is required to buy.

Since its conception, the Humani-
ties program has followed a historical
approach; the course follows the
developement of western tradition

chronologically. There was some dis-
cussion this summer as to whether
another approach, such as tracing
themes or moving backwards through
time, might be a better way of
organizing the program, but the team
decided to keep history as the
framework.

Many students say that this ap-
proach has helped them to orient
themselves historically and to provide
a way to fit into perspective special-
ized knowledge gained from other
courses.

Presents overall view

Rhodes feels that both students
and faculty have learned a great deal
through their participation in Hu-
manities. By providing an opportu-
nity for people to break away from
their specialized fields of interest and
to explore a wide range of topics, the
program presents the overall view and
can help one become aware of the
relationships that exist between dif-
erent areas of study.

But because it does take time away
from one’s academic specialties,
Rhodes feels that the program should
remain optional rather than become
compulsory for students and faculty.
Humanities, says Rhodes, should be
something one ‘‘needs to want to do,”’
not something one has to do.

Spencer speaks on issues

College receives $1 million
for commons , faculty chair

By PHILIP DUNCAN
News Editor

College President Samuel R.
Spencer, Jr. announced this
week that Davidson has re-
ceived $1 million in cash from
a couple who made anonymity
a condition of the gift.

Commons & professorshtp

In a speech to the College
community on Tuesday mor-
ning, Spencer said that half
the gift will be put toward the
building of a College Com-
mons (Dining Hall), and that
the other half would be used to
endow a professorship.

Cost of building the Com-
mons which will, when com-
pleted in about two years,
provide dining facilities for
600 students, is estimated at
$1 to $1.5 million dollars.
Because it will release Bailey
and Richards houses for the
creation of two additional
clubs or fraternities the Com-
mons will relieve overcrowding
pressures that have plagued
Patterson Court.

Few details on the endowed
professorship have been
worked out yet, but the en-
dowment investment is expec-
ted to be $25,000 a year, and
the chair will likely be filled
beginning in the fall of 1978.

College officials see the gift
as a major boost for David-
son’s 1987 program, which
seeks $35 million to provide
endowment for scholarships,
and faculty and administra-
tive programs, funds to con-
struct or renovate College
facilities, and funds to keep
the College’s operating budget
-in balance.

Spencer also spoke about

numerous other topics and
issues at the College--the revi-
sion of the Trustee by-laws
which grew out of last spring’s
Christian Tenure controversy,
the fraternities’ efforts to rein-

- stitute written bids on Patter-

son Court, the new Rusk
House eatin club, the recruit-
ment of blacks to Davidson,
the issue of evaluation, pro-
motion and tenure for profes-
sors, and the balance sheet on
last year’s college budget.

C
By-Law change

“Phe revision of the By-Law
reported out of the May
meeting of the Trustees is
moving on schedule towards
passage on October,’’ declared
Spencer.

The Trustees’ Executive
Committee met this summer
and considered the wording of
the proposed By-Law, he said.

The Committee made three
minor changes in the wording
of the proposed by-law and
have sent their final draft to
the campus for information
and comment,

The College came under fire
last year when it rescinded a
job offer from Ronald Linden,
a Jewish Political Science
professor. who accepted an
invitation to join the faculty at
Davidson, but warned that he
considered the College's policy
(contained in the Trustee by-
laws) of requiring all tenured
professors to “‘uphold and seek
to increase the College’s effec-
tiveness as a Presbyterian
church-related college” as
“morally repugnant, socially
anachronistic, and scholasti-

cally unwise.”

The Trygtees declared in...

their May meeting that it had_

‘

become ‘“‘increasingly clear
that it will be impossible for
the administration of the Col-
lege to apply to the provisions
of this by-law without the im-

plication of discrimination,” ~

and they voted to revise the
by-laws.

The revision stated that
“the President is also author-
ized to recommend for ap-
pointment as officers and Fa-
culty members non-Christian
persons of genuine spiritual-
ity, who can work with respect
for the Christian tradition
even if they cannot conscien-
tiously support it, and who
can live in harmony with the

DAV hopes to boost power

By JOE CRAIG
Staff Writer
Despite the many initial

‘doubts and rumors that arose

last--year, the status of
WDAV-FM, the campus radio
station, appears to be firmly
fixed as plans continue for
boosting its power from the
current 10 watts to 18,000
watts. This boost will give
WDAYV a broadcast radius of
approximately 80 miles.

“The WDAV staff and I are
extremely enthusiastic about
the situation at present,’’ said
WDAV Station, Manager Sid
Barrett. Many of the WDAV
personnel arrived on campus
early and during the past three
weeks have created a new
cataloguing system for the
records.

.. Records that. Barrett terms
as ‘‘unsuitable for WDAV’s

image’’, such as top 40 discs
and “‘commercial-sounding
music” are being weeded out.
And a special effort is present-
ly underway to expand the
classical, folk, and jazz collec-
tions.

Thus, states Barrett, the
staff's demonstration of a
willingness to work in a devo-
ted and competent manner
shows that they are ‘‘immi-
nently capable of handling the
increased responsibilities that
will be arising in the next few
weeks,”’

The administration appears
to be moving ahead in pursuit
of the power boost.

The primary step the college
has taken toward reaching
their goal is the hiring of a

‘“‘director of WDAV”’, Don:

Lovell, who ‘is to aid’ the
student staff in running the

station. Lovell has had exten-
sive experience in drama and
television productions at
Queens College in New York
City, where ne worked in
speech, radio, television, and
film for thirteen years.

Lovell sees his position as
one of a liaison between the
administration and WDAV.
“The trustees own the station,
and delegate much of the
responsibility to the student
staff. But with the boost to
high power, responsibility in-
creases correspondingly, and
obviously a liaison is needed."

Barrett is confident that
Lovell will help to pull toge-
ther and mold the talents of
the WDAV staff. But he
insists that Lovell has ‘‘no
interest in running the station
