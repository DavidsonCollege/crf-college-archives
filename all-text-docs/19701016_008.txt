Offense Scrapped
In Bucknell Loss

A. W. TURNER
Asst. Sports Editor

(For the second consecu-
tive week, David Fagg was
a disappointed man. Despite
playing a fine game, his
Wildcat gridders were de-
feated by Bucknell, 21-20, ,
for their second straight
loss. _

Saturday's Davidson team
showed a few new wrinkles.
On offense, the formation
was open. Using the Wish-
bone offense in the first two
games of ithe season: the
‘Cats were not able to move
the ball.

“It was by necessity that
we junked the Wishbone,”
said Fagg. ‘‘The execution
of the plays was giving us
trouble. So we decided to
open our formation so that
equal emphasis could be
put on passing and running.
“In the Wishbone we were
placing more stress on the
running game.”’

With the new “‘look’’ on of-
fense, Mike Mikolayunas
has, been moved out to a
slot or flanker position.
Therefore, he will be run-
ning less and catching pass-
es, more.

Using this new offense,
Wavidson dominated play in
the first half against Buck-
nell, but could get only se-
ven points on the board.
“We should have had two
more scores by halftime,”’
Fagg said

“One thing a team must
always do is keep putting
their opponent behind. When
you get them down 7-0, you
have to.keep going and get
them down 140 and then
210. You can’t let them get
. away, or. it can catch up
with you.”'

Me ‘Cat defense perform-
ed magnificently in the first
half, ‘‘just like you draw it
on. the. backboard,’’ com-
meeeees Fagg. But a change

is Bucknell back’ in the
‘game. Fagg. cited a con-
om aad 8 interference

Once again Davidson was
hit early in the game by in-
juries. Sean McCormick was
hurt in the first series of
downs, and WHugh Dennis
was injured later in the
agme. Against Trinity the
week before, the Wildcats
lost Jimmy Hardison early
in the game.

“It was really a -tough
loss for these boys,”’ the dis-
appointed Fagg said. ‘‘What
a fine game they played;
But we're still unbeaten in
the Southern . Conference,
and we're looking better all
the time.”

Under Head Coach Terry
Holland, a tremendous con-
flict is now being waged in
the Davidson -gymnasium.
Yesterday practice - com-
menced for this year’s Wild-
cat basketball squad.

This year preparation will
be different from any in
Davidson's immediate past.
Five scholarship players
have graduated, including
Mike Maloy, Jerry Kroll,
and Doug Cook.

The result has been the

opening of four starting posi-

tipns, and the chance for
many non-scholarship. men
to make great contributions
to this years squad. ‘‘It’s go-
ing to be a, dog-eat-dog bat-
tle,’’ accarding ‘to Holland.

Previous years have pre-
sented relatively new dilemn-
as with the- starting five
generally set. This year is
an exception, The team has
not played with each ‘other.

“This year it is a matter
of putting the team togeth-
er, since these boys. have not
played as much together,”
Holland stated. ‘We _ -will
need lots of scrimmages and
squad games.”’

There will also be much
time designated to funda-
mentals of ball handling, of-
fense and defense, and con-
ditioning.

Only four seniors are a
part of tthe ‘70-71 Wildcats.
They are Ron Stelzer, Dun-
can Postma, Billy Pierce,
and Steve Kirley. And over-
all the ‘Cats are a bit.smal-

SC Plans No

By ERNIE SHIPE

(Second in a series)

Although the Southern _Con-
ference has made no immed-
iate plans to alter member-
ship: policy or place limita-
tions on athletic grants, Ath-
letic Director Tom Scott dis-
pelled any notions that Davy-
idson would drop out of the
conference,

When the Spencer Commis-
sidn Reports were made pub-
lic; they reported that the
Southern Conference was in
such serious trouble, it must

make some changes presum- -

ably in membership and per-
haps _in policy, to survive.
The Commission recom-
mended that Davidson should
remain in the Southern Con-
ference until the nature of
* the. changes betomes evident.

‘They went on to suggest

that Davidson should ’per-

Suade the conference to a-

dopt ceilings on subsidization
that:-would permit Davidson
to compete successfully.

If. the conference failed to
adopt such measures; the
commission. suggested that
Davidson should actively in-
vestigate. the feasability. of
competing with other- insti-
tutiens of academic ~~ quality
comparable wW ith David.
son’s.

An attempt at putting limi-
tations on football scholar-
ships failed last winter, when

an attempt was made to
change the Southern. Con-
ference constitution.

Article 12 of the constitu-
tion ‘states that two-thirds of
all eligible delegates. must

’ vote’ in favor of making a“

change. in the constitution.

The constitution makes no
mention of limiting the num-
ber of grants a school gives
in any-sport. Most major
athletic conferences have ceil-
ings on grants-in-aid.

According to Tom Scott, the
vote at the meeting. was 4-3
in favor of changing the arti-
cle. Five votes were needed
to bring about constitutional
change.

Since the vote to get by
Article 12 failed, there was
no way to set limitations on
athletic scholarships.

“Farman, Davidson, VMI,
and The Citadel voted for
making the change with Rich-
mond, William and Mary,
and East. Carolina -opposed,”’
Scott explained.

“All four schools agreed
they would push for a com-
promise ceiling of 75 . foot-
ball grants and then were
unable to get this measure
to a vote.”

The athletic director said
that Davidson presently gives
52 football scholarships while
the other three ‘schools give
in the, neighborhood of 60.
Richmond gives close to 75.

By setting a limit, it would

‘We won't be able to dic-
tate the tempo for a game
as we did last year,”’ Hol-
land quietly stated. ‘‘Each
time we take the court we
are going to have to.play
the type of game we believe
will win for us, whether it
be run and shoot or ball
control,”’

Stelzer and Kirley, who
started at times last year,
should definately help the
club this year. Then there
is junior all-conference play-
er Brian Adrain. Probably
an All-American prospect, he
led the team in scoring last

"year.

Additional help’ can be ex-

Remember. the passing and
receiving display put on by
Mark Thompson and Rick
Lyon in that junior varsity
game against Gardner-Webb
last year?

Those are only two of the
present Wildcat starters who
earned. their  ,positions
through -hard work on the
JV team.

This year’s JV squad is
cotnposed of all varsity
players who are not in a
starting position, according
to offensive line coach Turn-
ley Todd.

Todd stated that the con-
cept of the JV team was to
increase the level of exper-

olicy

prevent schools: like Rich-

. mond from upping their total

toward 100, if a school like
Davidson began to increase
its athletic grants.

‘‘Another reason for limit-
ing the number of athletic
grants 4s the cost involved,”
stated Scott. ‘‘It cost us twice
as much to give one football
scholarship as it cost some
of these other schools.”

According to Scott, Rich-
mond and East Carolina have
no desire to be limited under
the present proposal.

William and Mary would
seem to be the easiest to
sway over to Davidson’s side.

Scott explained that Wil-
liam and Mary is in the pro-

squad, Duncan Postma, along

with Lester Strong. Out-
standing sophomore - pro.
spects include John Pe*

corak, Joe Sutter, and Gor-
don Graham.

The Wildcats should once
again have a strong team,
though not as powerful as
last year's team. They have
seven big. weeks of practice
before the opening game on

Dec. 9.

When Holland was asked
which college player he
would most like to have on
this year’s team, he’ imme-
diately countered with ‘‘The
biggest one I could find.”

JV Drops Opener

ience for the  nonstarters.
“It gives the coaches a bet-
ter chance to evaluate the
performance of younger and
inexperienced layers, and
helps to prepare the guys
for varsity competition,’’ he
added.

Last Friday the JV’s
tangled with the Western
Carolina freshmen at Cul-
lowhee. Although the ‘Cats
were on the short end of a
26-6 score, Todd estimated
that the Davidson offense
accumulated close to 500 to-
tal yards.

The major weaknesses can

be attributed to inexperi-
ence, as six intercepted
passes and = two fumbles

proved costly to the JV’s.

of scholarship holders from
90 to 75.

“However, Wiliam and
Mary» doesn’t want to put
any restraints on Richmond,’ Hy
said Scott.

The question of limiting
the number of scholarship re-
cepients has affected at-
tempts to expand conference
membership.

East Tennessee State, Chat-
tanooga__and _ Appalachian
have expressed their desire
to join the conference.

Because these schiols would
favor limitations, they have
been blocked from member-
ship. |
