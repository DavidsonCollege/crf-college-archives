THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 20, 1927

Dr. Martin Participates |
in Log College Program

President of Davidson College
Delivers Interesting Sermon
From Germantown Pulpit

Dr.. Martin has returned from his trip |
North to the celebration of the two hun-
dredth anniversary of’ the founding of Log |
College in Germantown, Penn. On the first |
Sunday of his trip Dr. Martin filled the pul- |
pit of Dr. John C. Calhoun, in that city. Dr. |
Calhoun is the father of J. C. Calhoun, class |
of ’27, |

On the following Tuesday, Dr. Martin at- |
tended the exercises at Mishaminy Church,
about 20 miles from Philadelphia. The pas-
tor of this church many years ago was Rev. |
’ William Tennent, who was the founder of |
Log College. A group of Christians, led by |
Rey. Mr, Tennent, founded the college in |
1727 and thus were the pioneers in Christian |
education in the United States, The college
did not flourish in its early days but was |
eventually the beginning of a great institu- |
tion, Princeton University and Seminary. |

During thé morning session “The Work of |
Women in Education” was discussed. The |
afternoon was spent in a rehearsal of the |
history of Log College and a visit to the site |
of the old school, which consisted of one very |
rough log cabin. Here a tablet was unveiled |
to the memory of William Tennent.

On Tuesday night at the Bellview-Strat- |
ford Hotel, in Philadelphia, a banquet was |
held, at which there were some 300 guests |
Present. Four speakers; one of which was |
Dr. Martin, entertained the group. Mr. Mar- |
tin spoke on the subject, “The Common Aims
of a Christian College.”

Dr. Martin spent the following two days in
New York City on business, coming down to
Baltimore on the 8th, where he spent the
week-end and then returned to Davidson,

Students to Hear
Inspiring Speakers

The local Y. M. C. A, through Howard
Arbuckle, chairman of the committee making
arrangements for speakers, has prepared a
very interesting schedule for the remainder of
the fall. The programs will be headed by
unusually outstanding men representative of
their own walk of life, and whose interests
vary from journalism and business to preach-
ing. The “Y” is striving to bring to the
men on the Hill a series of practical, helpful
and inspiring messages through men who are
vitally interested in college men, and who
have their interests, problems and desires at
heart.

On October 23rd the speaker at the “Y”
service will be Mr. Tom Glasgow, a man al-
ready well known to the Davidson student
body, and a man who never fails to stir and
thrill a fellow’s thinking and interest. In ad-
dition to Mr. Glasgow the “Y” is making in
some cases, and already has in others, defi-
nite arrangements to bring to Davidson such
men as Dr. E. G. Gammon, of Charlotte; Dr.
Vander Meulen, of Louisville, who will con-
duct the fall services; Mr. Douglas Rights,
of Winston-Salem, N. C.; Mr. Morgan
Blake, sports editor for the “Atlanta Jour-
nal ;” Bishop Penick, of this Diocese, and Dr.
J. S. Foster, of Winston-Salem. This out-
line can be supplemented by. the regular
Christmas service, which, this year, will be
the object of especial thought and planning
in order to make it a real, worth-while, and
helpful student service. All in all the “Y”
this year is effecting a work that merits the
keenest interest and co-operation on the part
of the student body, whose wishes formulate
the purposes of the “Y’s” work, If you are
not, start today to be a loyal supporter of
this organization, which, traditionally speak-
ing, has been an essential part of every Da-
vidson man’s college life.

the will of God, ye will know the will of
God.” A conscience enlightened by the Word
of God will hold its course despite the gloom
of intellectual doubts. Experimentation is
doing, and action makes the battle more real
and you have a better chance of winning.

Faith in God and His Word does not mean
that one must know all the details of Bibli-
cal authorship which puzzles scholars. We
need a picture of the living Christ and the
details of construction are not of vital im-
portance.

The ideals of the Kingdom of God must be
made the ideals-of ‘this world. The Golden
Rule must be made the rule of conduct among
nations and individuals of the earth, and
youth must assume the leadership in this
movement of facing squarely the issues of

Sophomore Colors

Selected Recently + very brief exercise will be held. Immedi-

At a recent meeting of the Sophomore |
class, the class voted to have the colors of
Blue and White. Several combinations were |
submitted by a committee and the final vote |
was between the two combinations of Red |
and White, and Blue and White, the color |
Blue and White winning out in the end. The |
committee appointed to submit the colors |
was composed of E. E. Marsh, chairman, A.
T. Edleman, and J. A. Moore. The class
pennant will be selected within a short time.

The plans for “Stunt Night” have not yet
been completed, but a*committee composed
of J. Mathews, E. C. Close, H. R. Mobley,
A. Frew, and S. C. Coker, under the direction
of John Foster, are working on it. The com-
mittee has asked all members of the class to
turn in ideas for a stunt to some member of
the committee. The committee has no defi-
nite idea in mind, but is trying to work up a
play in which members of the class will have
an opportunity to show their dramatic ability
and also do their part in helping the Glee
Club put over “Stunt Night” in grand style.
The committee is anxious to have as good a
stunt as is possible for all the alumni and
student body will be there to witness the
show.

FEW CHANGES MARK STUNT

The entire supervision of the Stunt Night
performance is in the hands of the Glee Club
and particularly directed by Professors Cul-
lum and Erwin,

One of the feature numbers which has
been annotnced is a vocal solo by Mrs. Cul-
lum, who is a noted musician, having appear-
ed in many outstanding programs in leading
musical circles.

Complete details will be arranged shortly
and announcements will be forthcoming from
the directors of the program as to additional
features and attractions. One statement,
however, is made at present, and that is that
all numbers will be of the -highest type and
that the entire program will be of strictly
first-class degree.

SPIRIT OF MIRTH OF JOY

ately after, this there will be an alumni lunch-
eon where there will be a get-together of all
the men and enjoyable discussions will be
heard.

The afternoon will be well supplied with
excitement when the Davidson College Wild-
cats meet the Cadets of V. M. I in what
promises to be one of the best football battles
of the season. The Red and Black team will
be seen staging a great fight to keep uncross-
ed a goal line which has never been shadowed
by an opponent, that of Richardson Field,
This will be the feature of the program.

The. evening will be taken up -with’ stunts
given by the classes and various student or-
ganizations on the annual Stunt Night. This
is one of the most enjoyable of the activities’
of the students during the year and this will
prove no exception with much humor and
mirth,

Plans are to make this the greatest day for
the alumni that has ever been seaged here
and fro mthe present sale of seats for the
football game, it looks as though there will
be a record-breaking crowd on hand.
