My Freedom

(The following is a true story, never be-
fore revealed in its full content to anyone. It is
presented in the hope that we, as thinking
Americans. might become more aware of world
problems and the people that face them as
exemplified in the story of Alfred Wang, foreign
student and Christian gentleman. Ed.)

BY ALFRED WANG

The mild October sun was still shin-
ing when two guards at the main entrance
of Shanghai Central Police Station turned
their heads angrily and looked daggers at
me. I, as usual, repeated my request while
one of them, as usual, took me to the wait-
ing room.

The room was as colorful as a pho-
tography display. The room-walls were
carefully decorated with portraits of the
communist leaders, both Russian and Chi-
nese, and on a wooded table were papers
and magazines for propaganda purposes. I
waited for forty minutes, but nobody
turned up; so I amused myself by looking
at the picture of Mao Tze Tung. whose
face became fatter, and the remarkable
mole above his double chin seemed bright-
er! I almost wanted to laugh when a
fierce looking man in blue Lenin-Suit fol-
lowed by a pig-tailed girl appeared before
me. The man was in his prime of life,
whereas the girl of twenty-five or six
looked like a Slavic woman in her forties,
with her many storied-chin toppling upon
her mighty breast.

“What do you want. Comrade Wang?”
the man asked, presumably in a friendly
tone, but putting one foot on a bamboo
stool, lighting a cigarette, and then push-
ing his starred “liberation cap” backward
in a scoundrel-like manner, “Why do you
want to see the Head?”

“What do I want?” I repeated his
words furiously, “I come here everyday
and yet you ask me what do I want? You
turned down my application for a permit
to Hongkong after two long years without
any reason given, and yet you ask me what
do I want! In a university, if the president
acts in such a manner I call it bureaucra-
cy. And I simply don’t know what you
would call. it in a police station!”

Their eyes opened wide simultaneous-
ly.

“Don’t be angry, Comrades,” I per-
ceived their defenseless uneasiness, “Karl
Marx taught us to be suspicious with
everything. And I am suspicious."

“Comrade Wang, I am stre you re-
alize that Hongkong is a feudalistic and
imperialistic place only good for those old
and disabled and gangsters. Our People’s
government is definitely opposed to issue
any permit for young folks, especially col-
lege students, to go there. The ‘Idealogi-
cal Reform Learning’ equipped you fully
with Marxism-Leninism as if a soldier
armed to the teeth!” the fast speaking girl
jabbered ferociously, her hands almost
daring to encompass me.

“Well, you surely don’t want to pre-
vent a brave soldier from going to fight!
Do you? To me, Hongkong is the battle-
field! Have you not faith in what I have
learned from the government?”, I put two
more telegrams on the table, “My father
is seriously ill in Hongkong, and I want to
be a filial son. You comrades always say
that the People’s government cares for
every individual, nor it is time for you to
perform your consideration for the peo-
ple’s need.”

“To be a filial son is rather an out-of-
date idea, isn’t iti?”, the man tried to at-
tack in a strange, hoarse voice, inadequate
and inept.

“I don’t care what you call it, I in-
sisted, I want the permit. If you refuse
me today, I will come here everyday as I
have already done in the past months, to
repeat my request. And if you do not re-
ceive me, well, I can read here and wait.
Comrades, you may be quite sure that I
will never go to school, nor work. I will
come here everyday: I want my permit to
Hongkong to see my father!”

That ended the last interview with
the police authorities. I say the last inter-
view because the very next morning, a

police sent my ex-permit, valid for three
months,-to my residence. It was raining
cats and dogs when he handed it to me
under the bamboo framed umbrella with
a forced big smile! But my smile was big-
ger, victorious and triumphant!

It was not at all easy for me to get
permission to leave school from the col-
lege president and the Party-secretary,
without which I still could not leave. How-
ever, I left no stones unturned and finally
got it by applying the same strategy—to
beat them at their own game! This pre-
cious experience taught me if only one
dared to fight with the communists, they
themselves became “paper-tigers,” a term
applied by them to the American-meaning
strong outside but weak inside. This is also
typical of communistic ‘justice’: when
they granted somebody’s request which
they could refuse no more, they tried to
make you feel grateful for the ‘“sugar-
coated” favor. This, no doubt, served to
explain the passivity with which the peo-
ple could endure the brutalities behind
the Bamboo Curtain.

This experience also reminds me of
another triumphant victory: In April of
1952, a violent accusation against the so-
called reactionary church leaders and
foreign missionaries was launched by a
radical group within the Chinese church,
right after the entry of the Chinese ‘‘Vol-
unteers” into the Korean War and the
intensification of ‘“hate-America Cam-
paign.” Their watchword then was: To
hate Americans, to despise the Americans,
and to be enemy with the Americans. Al-
most all missionaries were denounced in
public meetings, on the air, and in the
press,. as missionary spies and American
cultural aggressors. Dr. Frank W. Price,
an outstanding missionary in China who
baptised me in Shanghai and is now my
sponsor in America (who is also a David-
son graduate and who became the Modera-
tor of the Presbyterian Church in the U.
S., 1953-54) was tried in absentia in a mass
meeting of 12,000 people. Several weeks
before, the Communists threatened to
make me take an active part in the accusa-
tion. I told them that I would not, not
fearing what they might do to me. As a
result, I won the first round, and realized
how mean and how ridiculous their tricks
were! A wolf in sheep's clothing!

Early in the next morning, I took the
ex-permit and lined up at the Shanghai
Railway Station, bound for Canton. I mur-
mured good-by to my beloved native place
and to those who loved me, experiencing
what Shakespeare calls “Parting is such a
sweet sorrow.”

Once on the train, I pretended to be
sick and refused to speak a word to the
nurse and other men in uniform who at-
tempted to approach me. The politically
trained nurse, knowing that she would
get nothing from me, handed me a hot-
water bottle to sooth my stomach-pain.
In Canton, the cradle of Chinese revolu-
tion, I passed the final baggage inspec-
tion, police questionnaires, and crossed the
Portuguese-Chinese boundary on a ferry
sailing to Macao. As soon as I put my feet
on the soil of Hongkong, the frontier of

the free world, I mailed the permit back.

to Shanghai, stating that my sick father
needed me to look after him. It was Octo-
ber 18, 1952, a glorious day in my life!

Indeed, it took me two years to get
out of China, and three more years from
Hongkong to this country. During those
five long and anxious years, the Living
Lord never forsook me. The Biblical teach-
ings came alive to me in a new way, and
this ordeal brought me abundant spiritual
blessings. Intolerence taught me to love
tolerence; class-hatred taught me to love
good will; hardship taught me not to sur-
render to tyranny. “Rejoicing in our suf-
ferings, knowing that suffering produces
endurance, and endurance produces char-
acter, and character produces hope, and
hope does not disappoint us,”

The unbelievably awful dreams still
disturb me once in a while, but they will
soon disappear in a free world as vapors
melt into the air. Now I can think clearly
about my country, focus my concentration
in my study, speak freely what is in me
without fear, and gain twenty pounds of
my lost body-weight.

Intellectual Blind Man’s Bluff
And the Liberalistic Tradition

By JIM MARSHALL, EMORY KIMBROUGH, CLYDE ROBINSON

In last week's Davidsonian Mr.
Franklin Bloodworth asked us to
engage in a game of intellectual
blind man’s bluff in “questioning”
the Intercollegian, national YMCA
journal of opinion. This game
came to revolve around a mask
of illusion, innuendoes, and illogi-
cal inferences: And in addition to
some rather subtle omissjons (e.g.
failure to denote that certain
articles were by-lined), there was
the use of intellectual ruses which
are not quite honest. In short, the
writer persistently resorted to the
lifting from context certain refer-
ences and quotations.

We gladly respect the right of
anyone to express his opinion on
any matter, but we must strongly
object when facts and truths are
distorted and maligned in express-
ing those opinions. We are forced
therefore to dismiss the article as
an anti-intelectual vehicle.

Mr. Bloodworth’s article ran the
whole gamut in trying to stir up
the prejudices found in many peo-
ple’s minds, and it does this with
the finesse of a bull-dozer, scooping

‘into ready-made dogmatism. Among

his topics are the question of ad-
mitting Red China to the UN, the
class struggle, racial integration,
the fraternity system, and Chris-
tianity. The quotations relevant to
the first three questions were pure
appeals ‘to prejudice; they were
presented without support and
thereby created an artificial aura
of objectivity. On such questions
the reactionary instinctively draws
within his shell of prejudice and
short-sightedness, while the liberal
strives to weigh the situation in
the terms of reality and human
ethics. Mr. Bloodworth obviously
could not restrain himself from
comment on the fraternity system
and Christianity; nor can we.

The article stated that the Na-
tional Student Assembly recom-
mended that fraternities and
sororities lift all their discrimina-
tory clauses voluntarily, or if this
is not successful, to urge govern-
ing agencies to outlaw such clauses
through legal action in the case of
state-supported schools, What this
article fails to point out. is that
such a stand is merely the sug-
gested position for local YMCAs
and YWCAs, and is in no way
binding. In any case, is there any-
thing diabolical in the official
magazine of an organization, or
any other magazine, publishing the
recommendations of a representa-
tive group from all sections of the
United States? If we must react,
at least let us be informed.

Letter to the Editor:

Brinkerhoff on

Dear Editor:

This letter is written in refer-
ence to some of the sincere ques-
tions and comment of Mr. Blood-
worth in last week’s Davidsonien.

At the same time that we regard
the purpose of the intercollegian,
we should also examine the stated
purpose of our YMCA here on the
campus. According to the constitu-
tion, the “Y” encourages “mutual
growth in faith through worship,
study, and action.”

Certainly the scope of the Inter-
collegian includes the elements of
worship and study, and in more
than one instance which comes to
mind, has directly inspired sincere
Christian action.

The article goes on to plead for
the right of selecting those whom
we would have as fraternity
brothers. On this point we agree

with the stand taken in the article,

but not in the terms which it ad-
vocates. We must not overlook the
fact that it has been the Southern
fraternity chapters who have been
the principal factor in restricting
the right of free selection to all
non-Southern chapters. No chapter
is forced to select anyone; many
chapters, however, are kept from
selecting those of non-Caucasian
and non-Christian origin by their
discriminatory clauses. It is con-
sistent to demand the right of free
selection in your own chapter and
to restrict any other chapter's free
choice.

Mr. Bloodworth laments a quota-
tion from an article by Arnold
Toynbee which was reprinted from
the New Vork Times in the Inter-
coltegian in which Mr. Toynbee ap-
pears to condone the revolutionary
spirit of time as such. It is not ex-
plained that Mr. Toynbee feels that
our world is always going to be the
witness of some form of revolution,
wherein Western civilization can
rise above the power struggles of
this globe and live where other
civilizations have died, if we utilize
the dynamic Christian tradition
which is the core of Western cul-
ture.

Finally we are asked to ponder
whether or not Christianity is revo-
lutionary. Two thousands years ob-
viously have been overlooked when
one questions the revolutionary as-
pect of Christianity. In fact, this is
the very essence of the movement.
Furthermore, the total experience
of Christian life becomes a per-
sonal revolution when an individual
desires to investigate and proceed
beyond the confines of the ortho-
doxy of his parent’s generation, and
would thus become a constructive
element of society. :

Our only motive has been to erase
an attempted smear aimed against
the free mind in a dynamic socicty.
We defend the intercollegien be-
cause it advocates the cause of a
free mind in our world, and be-
cause it recognizes what would be
the result if such a right disap-
peared from our society. The
YMCA would be betraying its in.
herent philosophy if it fails to sup-
port those measures which lead to

‘a crusade for civil and social liber-

ties. We would assume that it at
least is aware of the dynamic
world of which it is a part, even
if those who use its organs and
criticize are not.

‘Intercollegian’

The articles therein are written
and signed by men recognized os
being committed to the task of
applying Christian principles to the
issues of every day life. Thus, our
purpose in subseribing to the In-
tercollegian is not to tell anyone
what to think or how to stend on
controversial issues. Rather we are
dedicated to the tesk of encourag-
ing students to think, period. This,
to me, is the essence of education.

PEACE VS. REVOLUTION

The second question which I
wish to speak on concerns the more
general question stated as follows:
“Is not the Christian response more
one of Peace than Revolution?”

Davidson’s Antiquated Election
System Overdue for Overhaul

(The Davidson system of student
elections has long been a topic of
discussion and controversy. Bill
Stewart, as official Oavidsonian
election reporter for the past two
springs is especially well qualified
to speak on this oft-debated sub-
ject. Ed. note.)

BY BILL STEWART

Last year the Student Body of
Davidson College voted to accept
a new and revised Student Govern-
ment Constitution. Old laws, such
as those concerning the drinking
of alcoholic beverages, were re-
vised to fit a more modern and
progressive student body. Other
provisions, such as the complex
system of by-laws, were removed
entirely.

The committee that rewrote the
Constitution failed, however, in
probably the most important part
of their work. They left as they
were the old and antiquated elec-
tion laws—laws which are blatant-
ly unfair, that are conducive to
descrepancies in both the casting
and counting of ballots, that have
as their result lethargy and com-
placency on the part of the student
body concerning the constitutional
officers.

FEBRUARY ELECTIONS?

The elections at Davidson gener-
ally begin sometime in the early
Spring (they have been getting an
earlier. start in recent years) and
the clections board considers itself
doing a fine job if every office can
be filled by the last day in chapel.
It would be necessary, under the
present system, with only three
chapels each week, to begin this
year sometimes in February of ear-
ly March. Spring elections in
Winter!

Elections are held in chapel, with
only two of the candidate groups
making any speeches at all; it is
assumed by those responsible that
everybody will know the best can-
didate simply because he is a mem-
ber of our small student body,
which is, of course, as always, one
big happy family. The end result
is often the election of the man
because of what he says in a five
minute speech; or even more
probable, because he is the one who
remembered the most names and
spoke the greatest number of times
to the greatest number of people

during the preceeding year. Fresh-
men with political ambitions—
speak!

Elections are atso unfair in that
they fawn disinterest. After two
months of “wait in your seat after
chapel,” many students, through
no fault of their own, ask them-
selves, “Why sit here to vote for a
candidate whom I don’t even know,
especially when he’s running for
an office I didn’t even know ex-
isted?” Consequently a large num-
ber leave without casting a ballot
and the minority rules. Perhaps
this explains why in some of last
year’s elections less than onc-half
of the eligible voters bothered to
vote.

CONFUSION
After a ballot is cast, what hap-

pens to it under existing law? An

election board consisting of fifteen
members (one from each fraternity
and four independents) is theoretic-
ally supposed to gather the ballots
and count them behind closed
doors. In practice, it works more
like this. One member or maybe
two, who have a free period follow-
ing chapel, rush up to the quad-
rangle room, separate the ballots,
and feverishly count them. I might
add that they have in the past, at
least in a few cases, been aided by
certain members of the administra-
tion, each having a more than aver-
age interest in the outcome. All
three, in fact, may be very anxious
to see their votes counted, and
there is no representative for the
hapless candidates on the other
side. It should not be inferrec from
this that I am accusing any student
Davidsonian, or any member of
our administration, of discrepan-
cies in ballot counting; I am sure
that the integrity of both is be-
yond question, even in times of
“impending catastrophe.” It re-
mains, however, that the system of
counting certainly leaves room for
improvement.

The election system as it now
Stands is not run systematically;
that its procedure is changed some-
what every year is evidence that
the provisions provided in the con-
stitution are inadequate. On some
days, the ballots are simply left in
the hymnal racks; at other times
they are passed out while the stu-

dents leave the auditorium. None

of these is a solution. When the
blank ballots are distributed be-
fore chapel, giving one ballot to
each seat, the auditorium is left
with a somewhat large proportion
of blank ballots. Other students
have often used these ballots, not
because of or even thinking about
the dishonest element, but because
dt is often lots of fun to see how
many times one can vote.

Davidson is often accused, both
by members of her own student
body and by those outside her
orbit, of being a complete com-
munity, of being confined to a
real ivory tower. It neither follows
nor leads, nor does it care.

UNIQUE AND UNWORKABLE

Certainly the elections system
furnishes a good example. There
must be few colleges in America
that have an election system so
unique and unworkable as does
Davidson. There are few colleges
in the land that, through practice,
have so little analogy to the elec-
tion systems that have proved
themselves in action.

There are those who will say
that campaigning and its ef-
fects are vulgar, that it accom-
plishes nothing. These, no doubt;
will be the philosophers or cynics
who find fault with everything
that anybody proposes.

It must be admitted that the
only thing gained from our present
system is a complacent spirit, a
non-aggressive government, and
walls and trees void of the ugly and
horrible scars left by tacks and
staples.

Again, it may ‘be wondered if
the attitude of the college, as deep
as it is, would be able to submit it-
self to any drastic physical change.
There may be doubt that enough
people would even take the trouble
to try for election if much effort
were involved. At least there would
not be twenty-five candidates on
every first ballot, nor would there
be the hand-me-down-any-office or
I-can-just-run-till-I- win- something
attitude.

The Student Council is sup-
posedly now working on a solution
to this unhappy situation. Let us
hope that a real, ambitious effort
will be made to institute a more
effective system, and that real
changes and not just another
yearly face-lift will be the result.

Freedom of Thought and Opinion
Periled by Modern Inquisition

BY TOM WARLICK

The investigator sat at the end
of the long low table. Around the
table were grouped the other mem-
bers of the Senate Investigations
Subcommittee. On one side was a
bank of busy newsmen, and in their
midst were constantly seen brilliant
illuminations from the photogra-
phers flashbulbs. On the other side
was a hushed packed gallery of
spectators.

Facing the investigator across
the large table was the witness, ac-
cused of violating the International
Security Act of 1950. The thin tall
witness appeared rather dignified,
a characteristic of most public
figures. His most noticeable fea-
ture was his bright red hair which
was resplendant in the glare of
the television lighting. The whir-
ring of newsreel cameras was all
that broke the silence of the scene.

The investigator, himself, was a
squat man who spoke with a slight
nasel twang and presented a gen-
erally unshaven appearance. A
hero of World War II, this man
was well known for his short, curt,
gutteral utterances.

He spoke slowly, “You are well
known in society as a conspirator,
an athiest, a dangerous revolution-
ary, a seditionist, and a critic of
our present form of government.
It has been reported that you said
in a letter to W. S. Smith last
November—now don’t try to deny
it, we've got the evidence—The
tree of liberty must be refreshed
from time to time with the blood
of patriots and tyrants. It is its
natural manure.’ Do you deny that
you wrote these words?”

“Of course not,” the witness im-
mediately replied, “‘A little rebel-
lion now and then is a good thing’.”

At this pandemonium broke
loose in the hearing room. Repeated
rappings of the chairman’s gavel
were necessary to quiet the crowd
of spectators and break up the be-
wildered conversations of the com-
mittee members.

Finally the chairman could be
heard, “Un-huh, un-huh, un-huh. It
seems pretty clear that this investi-
gation need not proceed further.
Un-huh, un-buh. It there any final

word which you would like to say
in defense?”

“Yes there is,” the witness said,
“‘when in the course of human
events, it becomes necessary for
one people to dissolve the political
bands which have connected them
with another, and to assume. .’”

“Come, come, man,” interrupted
the investigator in shrieking, “you
don’t expect this committee to
waste its time listening to such
trash and excess irrelevant verbage
as that, do you? You are attempt-
ing to make a mockery and a farce
of the proceedings of this commit-
tee. If you have nothing pertinent
or worthwhile to say, we will pro-
ceed.”

The witness was silent.

“Then it is the order of this com-
mittee," droned the investigator,
“that in accordance with the pro-
visions of paragraph two, section
five, subsection ¢ of the Internal
Security Act of 1950, that you be
deported from this land of liberty
back to where you came from.”

“Aye, aye,” shouted the delighted
committee members and the audi-
ence of loyal, secure, and red-
blooded Americans.

And the inquisition was over.

This type of trial or investigation
has not been uncommon in Ameri-
ea in the last few years. Ameri-
cans first became graphically fa-
miliar with the “big lie” during
the rise to power of Adolph Hitler
in the 1930s. Today the “big lie”
is rampant. Repeat a falsity often
enough and it will be believed as
truth.

In these days when security and
fear of communism are the chief
concerns of men, those who prey
upon such fears and desires rise
to power. If a man differs with
your philosophy, you have only
to label him a communist or an
atheist, and he is conveniently put
out of your way. Guilt by associa-
tion and trial by headline are the
conventional means of character
assination today.

In this connection we might do
well to harken back to the beliefs
of John Stuart Mill, famous 16th

century philosopher. He believed
that, “The sole end for which men
are warranted, individually or col-
lectively, in interfering with the
liberty of action of any of their
number, is self-protection.”

He believed that an opinion even
if actually false should not be
silenced. As Voltaire would put it,
“I disapprove of what you say, but
I will defend to the death your
right to say it.” Not only does a
man have a right to his own opin-
ion, but it is good for others to
have it expressed. “He who knows
only his own side of the case,
knows little of that,” Mills would
say. Nor is it enough to hear con-
trary opinions stated by others
who do not accept them. They
should be heard “from persons
who actually believe them.” “Their
conclusion may be true, but it
might be false for anything they
know: they have never thrown
themselves into the mental position
of those who think differently from
them; and considered what such
persons may have to say, and con-
sequently they do not, in any pro-
per sense of the word, know the
doctrine which they themselves
profess.”

This position is tempered of
course in that whenever the ex-
Pression of an opinion serves as
an incitement to action which
would result in violating the free-
doms of others, society has every
right to repress it without waiting
until overt harm results to others.
As Justice Holmes stated it in
Schenck vs. United States (249 US
47), “The question in every case
is whether the words used are
used in such circumstances and are
of such a nature as to create a clear
and present danger that they will
bring about the evils that Con-
gress has a right to prevent.”

In conclusion, those who would
condemn, disagree, refute, or ex-
Press opinions contrary to others
which have been advanced should
begin by attempting to under-
stand the other position thorough-
ly, and should proceed by bareing-
the full facts and by presenting
the material in its proper context.
