The Blood-Letting

By OR. DAVID L. SMILEY
Professor of H story
Wake Forest University

The significance of the Vietnam de-
bate that is so sharply dividing Ameri-
cans is that it is provoking serious re-
considerations of our national interests
and purposes.

Those who support the undeclared
unpleasantness in Asia do so on
grounds of national interest. They in
sist that it is necessary that we honor
our treaty commitments and that it
is prudent to maintain the policy of
containnient expressed in the Truman
Doctrine of 1947, the frenetic alliance
construction of Dulles. and the pledges
of Dean Rusk.

They predict that it would be fata!
-if our allies lost confidence in our
protective cover, or if the Other Side
discovered that we might back down
under duress.

That, they say, would mean endless
conflicts with an aggressive and de-
termined enemy who has pledged to
bury us.

But it is becoming evident that
events have wrecked this reasoning.

There are indications that our allies
have already lost confidence in our
wisdom, and fear that our impulsive
actions will incite a larger war.

Certainly they seem profoundly un-
moved by our pleas that they rush
with us to a diseased spot on the body
politic, there to die, like white cor-
puseles, for the well-being of the
whole. Instead of strengthening al-
liances, the conflict has apparently
weakened them.

And we seem already to be engaged
in an endless conflict with an aggres-
sive and determined foe. Our armed
power is systematically destroying
what it was intended to preserve.

Finally, there are indications that
the Communist leadership is quite
pleased that we are not backing down,
for our military actions create support
and unity among their otherwise di-
vided movement.

‘Indeed, were I sympathetic with
Communist objectives—which I am
not—-I would rejoice to see my pri-
mary enemy bogged down in a blood-
letting it cannot win and dare not
cease. and in the process of raising
doubts and eroding its leadership.

Such considerations as these have
divided Americans, and have turned
Dr. Spock’s attention from colic in the
cradle to re-reading Thoreau in the
thoroughfares.

Such considerations have also
raised questions as to policy. Is this
course of action, apparently produc-

ing results the opposite of their inten-
tions. in the national interest? Or
should we change it and for the best
argument advanced by its advocates—
that of national interest itself?

It should be to our interest to sup-
port rather than-oppose national self-
determination movements in the
world. Reports from Vietnam are al-
most unanimous in declaring that
nationalism. and not Communism, is
our enemy there.

In seeking to defend the independ-
ence of a country whose only claim to
existence is a set of surveyors’ lines
on the map. we have permitted the
Communists to assume the false posi-
tion of befriending the nation aspira-
tions of a people whose historic and
cultural relationships extend beyond
these artificial political divisions.

But even though the Communist
position may be a false one, and one
we may deplore, it would still be with-
in our national interest to have a uni-
fied Vietnam under a native leader-
ship long committed to resisting out-
side intervention and domination—
even if that leadership were dyed in
hues of brightest red.

Mao’s victory in China, or Tito’s in
Yugoslavia, or Castro’s in Cuba have
not strengthened world Communism.
They have instead divided and disin-
tegrated its monolithic facade. Who is
to say that a unified Vietnam, even
Communist, would not be a more ef-
fective barrier to Chinese expansion
than is the once-vaunted SEATO?

For Americans to assist in the na-
tional unification of those people, and
to ease the shock of transition from
colonialism through political division
to unity, would make friends instead
of enemies and would restore Ameri-
can foreign policy to its traditional
support of self-determination of peo-
ples.

It would mean admitting that we
have erred, and that would be humil-
iating. But other proud people have
made sililiar confessions recently
and have survived.

It would mean declaring that if the
Government of South Vietnam could
not hold the loyalty and allegiance,
and evoke the sacrifices, of the major-
ity of its population, it would not de-
serve the right to speak for them.

But it would also mean that Ameri-
cans would surrender the abstractions
which events have bankrupted and
return to a clear-eyed consideration of
their primary national interests in the
world, and their presistent problems

at home.

Oops...

Oh my. The word just got to us that Davidson's student body is in the
process of electing a new student body president to deal with campus issues.
Now here we've gone and not written a single word about it in the

editorial columns.

We just must have lost sight of what is important to the welfare of the

student body.

Our Turn

By John Gresham

ED. NOTE: John Greshem is a
1967 graduate of Davidson, now
emploved by the college. He will
enter the U.S. Army in April, 1968.

Tuesday evening the American tele-
vision audience was treated to a long-
overdue feature, a realistic appraisal
of the Vietnam war.

This evaluation did not come from
a representative of the government
that has helped give birth to a new
phenomenon, the credibility gap. In-
Stead it came from a television news-
man who for the past several years
has been overshadowed by the flashy
but, perhaps less perceptive, pari of
newsmen on a rival network.

Walter Cronkite returned to the
United States after reviewing in per-
son the results of the Vietnam Tet
offensive. His conclusions should be
considered by all Americans, whether
hawk or dove.

He said he believed the Vietnamese
war is destined to continue in a stale-
mate, for the physical and objective
realities of the situation are such that
neither side will ever be able to win
an overwhelming victory.

The U.S. has the capability to de-
ultimately, But it is

story the earth f)
faced with opponents in the world

situation who have the same capahili-
ty. The North Vietnamese with their
mutual borders with other Commun-
ist countries can continue to resupply
and meet any U.S. strategy short of
ultimate holocaust.

Cronkite believes, therefore, that
it is time for the U.S. to come to the
conference table to negotiate the best
possible settlement it can obtain, rea-

ng that this may well be a settle-
ment which does not seem to justify
the loss of life and material which has
gone into our effort in Vietnam.

Cronkite’s position seems to us to

be sound. Such a conclusion to the °

war is certainly not one that leads to
rejoicing; in fact, it will probably be
many years before our country fully
comprehends what our effort in Viet-
nam has cost our society.

But if we can gain one invaluable
lesson from this war, let it be this:
ideologies and systems of thought
have not reached the point where they
can cope with every situation they en-
counter. Communism with it’s theories
of the historic inevitablity of the dia-
lectic lost in Indonesia where it at-
tempted to go against the history, the
culture, and the realities which make
up Indonesia.

Perhaps western democra has had
to take Its turn in Vietnam.

LETTERS, TO THE EDITOR

Good

EO. NOTE: The following
letter from debate coach Ray
McMillan proved too long fo
print and impossible to cut
down and still preserve its
value. It is to be continued
next week.

Dear Editor.

This letter was originally
intended as a reply to the
young man who felt that rules
were wrong unless they could
be readily manipulated to
suit his personal preferences,
but after my first angry re
action I realized that his at
titude merely reflects those
which seem to be prevalent
among the majority of the
student body.

So 1 wish to address mv
remarks to the student body
at large.

First of all, I am going to
suggest that he who argues
that “‘good rules are [exible
rules’ is reasoning from an
unsupported premisc.

Who says good rules are
Mexible rules? The same fel-
low who said. “Rules are
made to be broken.” I -am
hot saying that the premise
cannot be supported but 1
am saying that you
merely taken its truth. for
granted.

1 think I can make a pret
ty good case for the opposite:
As an individual, i.e., a stu
dent at Davidson, you com
promise one one thousandth
of the whole. When your ex-
istance (sic) is viewed in that
manner, you are pretty. in-
significant.

That is a fact you will have
to face whether you like it or
not. As a citizen of this coun-
try you comprise less than
one two hundred millioneth
of the whole.

How does that grab you?
Where then did you acquire
the conceit to convince your-
self that a rule made to gov-
ern the one thousand or the
two hundred million should
be suspended or modified to
meet your persona] demands.

“But good rules must be
flexible!’ you shout. If that
rule were suspended to allow
for your exception then the
precedent has been set for
the 999 more exceptions With
1,000 exceptions to it. that
rule has literally been flex-
ed" to death.

With the rule gone the or-
der by which societie:, guide
themselves is also gont

As hard as it may be to ac-
cept the fact. rules arc not
made specifically to serve
the individual but the name-
less, faceless whole

There are'even rules. which
may not serve any individual
but he must accede to them
because he is an inescapable
part of the whole. In short jit
is necessary that the whole
function efficiently. even to

have.

At this point you may be

and you may be correct.
Now, let's see if some flexi
bility cannot exist to make
allowance for exceptions
without destroying order:
Class work for a course of
study must be completed be-
fore a certain date. a final
examination must be taken
by the student before a cer-
tain date, and a grade must
be recorded before a certain

date.

That's the rule. Yet. cer

to that rule without upsetting
the order of the operation.

make up that exam at an es
tablished time. That, my
friends, is flexibility at work!

Why then do you charge
inflexibility? Is it because it
is not the particular type of
flexibility that suits your
own whims?

Is it because you are ex
pected to retain a bit of
knowledge for two months
longer that you would like?

inflexibility because the rule
does not allow them to study

1 wid admit that I think
this college needs to promote
this selfish attitude when it
implies -in its advertizing.
“We will provide an educa-
tion tailored to your personal
needs. We are interested in
you.”

It reminds me of the new
motto of the CBS network,
“CBS: where what you want
to hear comes first." Frank-
ly, I disapprove, but this is
a private institution and has
the privilege of setting its
own policies. If 1 don't wish
to accept them I have the
same option open to me that
you do—find another pasture

Howard Advises
Timely Changes

Dear Editor,

Given that the purpose of
clocks is to tell the correct
time. and given that David-
son has many clocks which,
because of their telling the
correct time, should agree, I
must confront the college
with two alternatives open to
it in view of its inability to
keep its clocks in agreement
with either the bells or any
accepted central standard
(Eastern Standard Time,
Greenwich Mean Time, etc.).

One dlternative is to stop
all clocks at a given minute,
thus giving our campus the
eerie phenomenon of having
clocks that agree. And, given
that a stopped clock is right
twice a day, we would have
the correct time far more
frequently than we do now.

The other alternative is to
establish a Dean of Clocks.
This office would require sev-
eral assistant deans, a secre-
tary, and an answering serv-
ice (to handle incoming com-
plaints). The dean and his
assistants would have the
task of going around the
campus from clock to clock,
setting them forward or
backward and speeding them
up or slowing them down.

One of the assistant deans
could be designated assistant
dean of clocks, Department
of Bells and Buzzers and
achieve a much-needed but
rare coordination with the
clocks.

I must close now, as I am
late for class... I think...

Speaker Ban Survives
In 27-Year-Old Statute

ED. NOTE: The following
article was taken from The
Daily Tar Heel of the Univer-
sity of Nerth Carolinas, Feb.
22, 1968. The auther is Rick
Gray of the Ter Heel staff.

The speaker ban law may
be dead, but its idea still re-
mains law in the state of
North Carolina.

Passed in 1941 under the
subtitle of “Subversive Activ-
ities, there is a law that
prohibits any state-owned
building from being used
“for the purpose of advocat-
ing. advising, or teaching a
doctrine that the government
of the United States, the State
of North Carolina or any po-
litical subdivision thereof
should be overthrown by
force, violence or any other
unlawful means.”

While this first law applies
to all state-owned buildings.
or buildings owned by an in
stitution supported ‘“‘in whole
or in part by State funds.”
the speaker ban law, passed
in June of 1963, prohibits
such use only of buildings
owned by _ state-supported
colleges or Universities.

Also the 1941 law applies
to all persons who are con-
sidered ‘‘subversive.” not
only Communists as that
speaker ban does, but also
the right wingists.

It would be conceivable
that the 1941 law could be
expanded to cover such or-
ganizations as the American
Nazi Party, the Black Adus-
line and similer groupe cell.

ing for radical change in the
U. S. government.

Political observers across
the state, who dug the 1941
law up out of the post-World
War If dust it was buried in,
are saying that the General

Assembly will probably not
try to write a new constitu-
tional speaker ban, but will
rely on the power of the 1942
law for all of the regulation
that the legislators feel is
needed on college campuses.

‘The Graduate’ Portrays

Boredom Without Boring

ED. NOTE: The following
is a review of ‘The Graduate,’
now showing ef the Plaza
Theater in Charlotte, by
juntor Ashton Trice.

T found The Graduate to be
an extremely funny motion
picture. Mike Nicholls’ ex-
perience as a professional
comic gave this film a sense
of timing that can hardly be
criticized.

His direction of Dustin Hoff-
man, the graduate, a fish out
of water in the non-academic
world, is particularly witty.

Equally as fine is Ann Ban-
croft’s portrail of the sultry,
worldly-wise older woman
with whom the graduate be-
comes entangled.

The movie sees the world
through the graduate’s point
of view, the ennui, the con-
fusion, the frustration of his
life, without ever becoming
boring, confusion, or sorbid.
It remains throughout funny.

Perhaps the most marvel-
ous scene is the final one.

Though Mr. Nicholls has em-
phatically stated the con-
trary, one cannot help see-
ing the crucifixion symbol-
ism in this scene. and the
eventual salvation of this
young Jewish boy through the
cross.

Perhaps this scene. which
is as obvious as a James
Dean dying scene, is a paro-
dy of the Christ symbol. The
comedy comes across without
appearing blasphemous to
anything but other movies.

It would be difficult to find
another film currently being
shown that is more entertain-
ing than “The Graduate.”'

It is entertaining. but lacks
many of the more profound
qualities of Nicholl’s earlier
film, or, for that matter, Miss
Bancroft's.

see it. If you want more, try

Clyde” or ‘In the Heat of
the Night” second UUme

a bit fed up with the con.

The ‘‘wrong key’ incident
became a scapegoat for your
own irresponsibility. Why did
the fire extinguisher have to
be locked in the first place?

Columns And Comments

The in thing for columns now, if I can judge by
the sports pages of the Charlotte papers, is interviews
with and character sketches of Davidson basketball
players. I suppose this is not surprising, considering
the success of the team, but it strikes me as unfair
that former “scholar-athletes” (it used to be simply
“student-athletes”), who became ex-jocks by turning
in their... uh, uniforms, are not publicized in the’
same way. This column is devoted to garnering the ex-
jocks some measure of publicity. Since I didn’t have
the time or inclination to interview these fortunate
few, the following is what I imagine such interviews
would be like in a typical sports column.

Cecil Clifton was in the dining room of his frater-
nity house, where he waits tables one week a month.

“Hey, Geoffer,” he greeted.

“Hey, Cecer,” I quickly retorted.

Clifton, from Avondale Estates, Georgia, was on
basketball scholarship for two years.

The shy senior talked about his pob as waiter:
“Yeah, my basketball has come in handy on the waiting
shift. Yesterday, for instance, at supper, I hit the ol’
wastebasket six tmies in a row with paper cups, and
twice in a row with plates, throwing frisbee style.”

__ To emphasize his point, Clifton wadded up a nap-
kin and flung it straight and true toward the basket.

When asked if he ever missed, the gesticulating
Georgian allowed, “Well, right now I’m hotter than a
two-doilar pistol. I have my bad weeks, though, when
Pm colder than a walrus’s mustache after three laps
around Hudson Bay.”

I asked the articulate Atlantan about reports that
he wasn’t a particularly good dribbler.

“Why don’t you stick around for the meal and find
out for yourself?” 5

Taking the cool Clifton at his word, 1 positioned
myself near the kitchen dor so as best to observe his
waiting style. He replaced empty platters and depleted
pitchers with gusto, and at the same time wolfed down

own lunch.

Clifton had every right to confidence when he
asked me to put reports about his dribbling to hte
empirical test. As the meal unfolded, it became obd-
vious that not only does the suave student possess great
stamina, but also that he is the best dribbler P've seen
since my own pre-school days.

I next decided to seek out Bobby Lane, who also
was on basketball scholarship for his first two years.

Bobby (or, as his friends call him, Bob) has sunk
pretty fast since he gave up the cager’s art. The de-
generacy of his attire (khaki pants and white socks) is
matched only by the hairy frowth immediately above
his upper lip, which ‘I at first mistook to be a skin

The Cajun cager (Lane is from New Orleans) has
been relegated to obscurity since his sophomore year.
In point of fact, I did not know who he was until
somebody siyzing hall pointed out that the monk in the

What do you know good?” I asked provocatively.
I can't really answer that question without fur-
ther amplification on your part concerning just what
exactly are your epistemological assumptions with re-
spect to your criteria for knowledge, and, secondly.
what sort of system of aesthetics and ethics you imply

when you speak of the good.”

Now, I realized, 1 have this restive radical by the

specs. Lane was set up for the kill.

I fired my next question at him: “Just what have
you contributed to Davidson College since you quit
playing for Lefty?”

He muttered something about the Blue Sky Com-
mittee. Shaking my head in disgust at the fall of the
toed ene I quietly shut the door and dejectedly tip-

As the door swung shut, I heard something about
a student committee to advise the trustees in their
quest for a new college president. Just before I reach-_
ed the stairs, I could barely hear him talk about a
pretty good grade average.

Lane may be on a fantastic array of committees
and Lane may be a Dean’s List student, Lane may be
in ODK and @ may be one of the most analytical
thinkers at Davidson, Lane may exhibit great respon-
sibility and Lane-may exhibit a genuine concern for
the great social issues of the day, but Bobby Lane will
never become a mersber of the Beaver Club.
