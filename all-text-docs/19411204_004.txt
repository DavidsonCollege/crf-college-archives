CAT CHAT

By LACY MacLEAN

The changing calendar brings around basketball season
whether the weather is right or not, and so its fitting to talk
a little about it.

The outstanding fact about the court game here at
Davidson is the loss of Jim Hogg, but that’s that, and the
enticing question, as always, is in the field of conjecture.

Prognostications

Certainly nothing can be more unreliable than pre-season
prognostications, but at the same time, they hold an ever-
lasting interest. The question this year seems to be whether
or not the Wildcat, a little short on real high calibre scoring
prospects can whip themselves into a unit with all the boys
tossing a few into the netting pretty frequently. In the past
there’s always been Hogg to pass to and Hogg to shoot, but
from here on out, it looks like everybody is going to get a
chance to rack up the points. .\n this is a coaches dream—a
well-balanced club, with everybody \scoring, if they@can just
get enough scoring accomplished.

It is probable that Chach Shepard will switch his court-
men into just about as many combinations as possible dur-
ing these first practice games this week and next, and
he may have to keep up this switching until later. When
it comes, we'll know that he’s still looking for the five
that can work together best. That seemed to be the trouble
at times last year for a while one quintet would move
like clock work, and then they’d run down, and another
shift would have to be made.

The first experimental five this year was the starting bunch
against Bill Quick’s J. O. Jones’ aggregation on Tuesday night.
Johnny Frederick and Dave Spencer were the forwards,. John
Belk was at center, and Buck Yarborough and Jack Wayman
started at the guards rhis bunch left four lettermen out
of action besides the four who were in the fighting, but there’s
a chance that thig might be the combination which will hit the
nail on the head.

A rather large injury list for basketball put somewhat
of a crimp into the early practices, but the casualties should
be mended by the time the conference race starts.

Bob McLeéd and Ed Lucas, both letterman, have missed
most of the rough practice scrimmages, Mac Bruce is out: and
Pat Williams and George Marsh have both been going at half
speed at least a little of the time because of football hurts.

Whether or not the Carolina game, scheduled at such
an unusually early date will go up into the Davidson win
column is another bit of speculation. The phantoms have
the reputation of being a slow team to get started, but
they’ve almost two month’s start on the Cats in the length
of their practice sessions, and this may: mean lots of dif-
ference in the two team’s timing, passing, etc. No doubt
Glamack’s departure will hit the Tar Heels just as hard-
as Hogg’s loss to the Cats, and so they’ll be even on that
score. The conference competition will be tough this
winter, and a start on the right foot would go a long way.

The boys have twelve conference games, and the usual bet
for invitation to the tournament at the of the season
requires a .500 percentage or better. The twelve conference
games are with North Carolina, Duke, State, South Carolina.
Furman, Citadel, at the rate of two apiece. The entrance of
George Washington-into-conference-eireleswill make the com-
petition for tourney berths stiffer by a long way, and an even
break might not mean tournament chances. Add on top of
that, the Cats are playing some of the best in the circle. Last
year the Virginia teams, on the average a little weaker than
the N. C. and S. ©. fives could have provided a pass port to a
good conference record, but this season they're off the schedule
making things just that much tougher.
