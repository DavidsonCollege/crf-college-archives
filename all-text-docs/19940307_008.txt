"Die question is this: Does Bill
Gullan actually know or under-
stand what he writes? Does he
understand that even opinion ar-
ticles need facts to support their
ideas? The root of the tragedy in
Gullan’s article, “Teach the poor
to bake,” is that he ventures into
territory that he knows absolutely
nothing about: economics.

He first questions the idea that
government has a responsibility to
improve the living standards of the
poor. The fact is, the government
does have a responsibility. Any
respectable student of political sci-
ence or even history should know
that it is the obligation of the gov-
ernment not only to protect its
people but also to provide the high-
est standard of living possible given
the country’s resources.

When government officials
fail to perform these duties ad-
equately, new officials are elected.

OPINIONS

There is a cuckoo

in the Gull's Nest.

When the entire government fails
continuously, that is usually the
cause for revolutions, as history
has shown to the more astute learn-
ers among us. Take, for example,
two famous revolutions: the French
in 1789 and the Russian in the
1917. In both instances, the distri-
bution of wealth among the people
was immensely disproportionate.
Eventually, both rulers of the peri-
ods were recorded in history as
incompetent monarchs who were
subsequently dethroned.

Gullan, undaunted, continues.
He mocks the very factors that
have fostered the environment of
economic growth and development
in the United States for the last 100

years: public institutions. How
else does Gullan think a country
becomes industrialized without an
educated work force? Any student
of economic development would
understand that one of the biggest
factors of human development is
capital. Education is needed to
develop human skills, and health
care is needed to maintain physical
skills. How else could economic
giants such as the U.S. and Japan
maintain their positions without
the quality work force that they've
created through public institutions
such as public education?

But here comes the big one: in
his article of the previous week,
“The future American slavery,”

Gullan thinks that the best form of
government, the one that he be-
lieves is best for society, is anar-
chy. He believes that the govern-
ment should stop meddling in
everyone’s affairs and let every-
one do what they want to do. Isthat
not virtual anarchy?

Ina most hilarious quote from
Gullan, he questions the govern-
ment collecting taxes from him
and then using his tax money to
pay for “services others arbitrarily
receive.” He writes: “Why should
Robert Maplethorpe get my
money? Why should I pay for
Hillary Clinton’s transportation?”
He asks, “How can a government
justify forcefully taking my money

(we would call it theft if anyone
else did it) and arbitrarily distrib-
uting it?”

The hilarity of Gullan’s state-
ments comes from the fact that his
only experience with taxes comes
from filling out W-2 tax withhold-
ing forms, which means he does
not pay any taxes at all. Does that
mean he is stealing from the gov-
ernment? Is Gullan actually sug-
gesting that each tax dollar should
be accounted for and matched with
the service received? If so, how
much police protection and sanita-
tion service can Gullan actually
afford with his present income?
This is why Bill Gullan’s articles
are so ironic and hilarious.

Another fallacy is Gullan’s
interpretation of the collapse of
communism as the result of pov-
erty and squalor among its people.

The issue of the Swimsuit Issue

I, was a typical Thursday morn-
ing. I had just finished my 8:30
class (that I always goto, ofcourse),
and I was on my way to the post
office. I always feel confident
going to the P.O. on Thursdays

because I am guaranteed mail.

Sports Illustratedcomes on Thurs-
days. It’s no monumental occa-
sion, but it sure beats the wind
tunnel that I get the majority of the
time.

Anyway, as it turned out, this
week was the week that they is-
sued the swimsuit issue. People
had been talking about it for a
while; I guess T just let itslip my
mind.

To make a long story short, I
was walking back to the famous
Little dorm flipping through the
issue when a female friend of mine
approached me and said rather
bluntly (and this is a very abbrevi-:
ated version):

“Holt, please tell me you’re
not looking at that.”

“Well, actually, I was.” (I
couldn’t really lie about it.)

“God, that’s so degrading.”

“What is?”

“That!” she said, as she swat-
ted Kathy Ireland’s face on the
cover.

“You mean this magazine?”

“Yeah. I can’t believe they
have all of those innocent girls in
bathing suits like that.”

“What’s wrong with that? It’s
not like they were forced to do it.”

“You’re missing the point,
Holt. Why do you think that we
have such a problem here at
Davidson with eating disorders,
girls going on crash diets, and
things like that? The reason’s be-
cause society praises these girls
for having good bodies. It’ssick. I
mean, all you guys do is look at
these girls superficially. You judge
them strictly by what they look
like. How do you think that makes

some girl feel who can’t have that
kind of body? Do you know what

kind of pressure that puts om girls?
It’s a shame what this society has
come to. It’s just so degrading...”

To say the least, I was a little
taken aback by the way this friend
of mine went off. I didn’t really
know how to respond. I under-
stood her point and where she was
coming from, butI guess you could
say that I was not exactly prepared
for this kind of debate in the middle
of Main Street. Nonetheless, I had
to. get to my ten o’clock class, so I
thanked her for her company and
said we would talk about it some
other time.

To be honest, I run into dis-
cussions like this one quite fre-
quently. This friend of mine is just
one of the many people that feel
the same way about things such as
the swimsuit issue. I have always

had given up slothfulness for Lent.
As Susan Beale wrote in last week's
column, swimsuit madness is hap-
pening tome (or was that the great-
est love of all?—no matter). I’ve
even gone so far as to stop taking
the elevator in Chambers, and all
of my classes are on the THIRD
FLOOR! Yup, I’m pulling out all
the stops this Lent.

Call it vanity, but I bet you a
billion dollars that anyone you find
running is doing it because he or
she wants to look like Andrew
Shue or Elle McPherson, which-
ever the case may be.

“Uh, excuse me, mister jour-
nalist'wanna-be. I run because it
m me feel good. Haven’t you
erate ofarunner’s high, man?
It’s 1, eal. The chemicals in the

/

brain are more powerful than
heroin. Just try that buzz once and
you won’t be able to quit. Running
is the best time I’ve ever had.”

Yeah, and I drink beer to stay
inshape. Why can’t you findsome-
thing better to do with those legs of
wire and chest of bird?

If I ever want to put forth
physical energy to make myself
feel good I just—oh, never mind.
They censored the article I wrote
on that subject.

As a result of all this physical
activity, I find myself in a constant
state of excruciating pain. Icanno
longer straighten my arms all the
way or lift them over my head. So,
if you see a guy who looks like
Pee-Wee Herman and walks like
Arnold Schwartzenegger, it’s prob-
ably me. .

I really need a massage.

tried to be sensitive to women’s
issues, and thus, I have given this
argument much thought. And I
can’t help but say that I simply
disagree.

First of all, the swimsuit issue
is not pornography. I think por-
nography is an entirely different
story. However, it is correct that
the swimsuit issue does “show off”
the bodies of these women. Now,
I admit that I am no expert in the
field of modeling, but it seems to
me that these women would be
honored to have the opportunity to
model for such a prestigious issue.

Modeling, like any other busi-
ness, is a very competitive field.
Most likely, these women have
been training for this opportunity
for much of their young lives. For
many of them, it has been their
dream to be in the swimsuit issue,
and this opportunity will most
likely sky-rocket their careers. Not
to mention that they are getting
paid a tremendous amount of
money for what they are doing.
Hence, I think it is fair to say that
these women were not forced to be
models.

Second, I think that one of the
problems people have with the

swimsuit issue is simply the legiti-
macy of modeling in general. Many
people see modeling as companies
using women's bodies to make
money.

Well, I think that this is true.
People are using these women for
their bodies. However, my ques-
tion is how is modeling any differ-
ent from a professional sport? The
owner of a football team will keep
a 350-pound man on the line to
rough up the opponents. For this,
the player will get paid a large
salary. But what if this player gets
hurt? Do you think that the owner
is going to keep the player on the
roster simply because he is an in-
telligent guy? Of course not—this
guy will be unemployed because
his body is not “usable” anymore.
If modeling is immoral, then why
is football not considered the same?

Final, and I think most impor-
tant to my friend’s argument, is the
question of the influence this issue
has on other women. Is society to
blame for the number of cases of
eating disorders? Well, I would
have to say that, though I empa-
thize with people that do have eat-
ing disorders, I think that it is
stretching the argument immensely
to blame the problem on society.
To blame this problem on things
such as the swimsuit issue is using

it as a scapegoat. It’s “passing the
buck,” as the old saying goes. Yes,
I would have to say that people are
influenced by these swimsuit is-
sues. I think thatitis also fair to say
that some people do resort to eat-
ing disorders in order to attain looks
similar to Kathy Ireland’s.

So, what are we supposed to
do—eliminate all modeling issues?
Yeah, and while we’re at it, why
don’t we eliminate all the violence
on television and the profanity in
music so our innocent children
won’t get “corrupted.” If we did
this, our crime problems would be
solved. Our society would be per-
fect!

Okay, forgive my sarcasm, but
I think the point is the same. It is
not society’s job to look after our
kids. They are going to be exposed
to this violence in one way or an-
other. As most people agree, it is
the responsibility of the parent to
teach our children how to handle
this exposure to violence.

The same holds true for the
swimsuit issue. It is not the fault of
this magazine for the eating disor-
ders and problems. Itis the fault of
the individual. It is not that we
have strong people being influ-
enced by a weak society. The real
problem is that we have a strong ©
society influencing weak people.

Court opponents can't see the positive side

draw, no president or other offic-
ers. In short, not being an organi-
zation severely limited the good
things we could do. We could not
perform the valuable functions of
fraternities, but we could still de-
stroy the same amount of property
and drink the same amount of beer.

At Davidson, the open-party
system prevents the elitism associ-
ated with fraternities from alienat-
ing the rest of campus. What else
isbad about fraternities? The deca-
dence? The drunken vandalism?
Those would unfortunately still
occur if we all reverted back to just
small groupsof friends. A drunken
independent vandal is no better
than a drunk with a pledge pin.

Why is it, then, that certain
elements of the Davidson commu-
nity would eliminate our com-
paratively mild fraternity system?
Is it the lack of service?

I know for a fact that many

people would not have partici

in certain programs had it not been
something that the fraternity did as
a group. If Isold hot dogs, I would
probably not give the earnings to
the Arosa House for Battered
Women and Children.

However, our fraternity de-
cided, as a group, that helping out
that organization was worthwhile.
Would I be motivated, on my own
with my “informal” friends, to raise
money for Easter Seals? Probably
not. But again, we are doing it asa
group.

Being an organization with
common funds and obligations
greatly increases our ability to do
good. The opponents of fraterni-
ties often disregard the good we
do.

One such opponent is
Reynolds Price, the author and
Duke professor, who spoke at Con-
vocation last year. There was a
quote from him two weeks ago in
The Davidsonian about “anti-in-

tellectualism” at Duke.

He said that the one sentence
he hears most often from students
is, “Ican’t believe how drunk I was
last night.” His solution, appar-
ently, is to eliminate fraternities
and make all dorms coed.

Now, I don’t get this coed
thing, but the really dangerous im-
plication here is that fraternities
cause drunkenness. That’s like
saying that the smoking room
causes people to smoke. Sorry
folks, but the smoking room does
not, awful smell aside, create smok-
ers. Also, the smoking room
doesn’t raise money for people who
really need it.

So, fraternity men and eating
house women, stand up and defend
the system that has led to hours of
fun as well as a plethora of worth-
while activities,

Andto those of you who would
put-a faculty country club where
Patterson Court is now, maybe you
are the loopy ones who are drink-
ing too much.
