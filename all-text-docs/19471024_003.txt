tinuation of “Patterns for Con-

as was Hitler. They claim, how-
ever, that they go in that direction
solely for the purpose of arriving
at a diametrically opposite goal,
whereas Hitler admittedly was
committed to the proposition for
its own sake alone. Giving Stalin
the benefit of the doubt and, con-
ceding that his end motives are
“pure,” for the moment only, the
hard fact remains that totali-
tarian police state must continue to
exist until the fanciful and utopian
dream of pure Communism is
achieved, In the meantime the in-
dividual must be subjected to the
harshest conceivable discipline; re-
ligion as we have it must be sup-

not perpetually exist in a world in

At this point it might fairly be
asked why no 4nention has been

answer to that question would
seem to be this:
