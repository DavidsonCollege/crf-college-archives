Cats Top Appalachian
In 7068 Overtime Win

By SCOTT HUIE

The only predictable thing abéut pre-
season predictions is that they are usually
wrong. Exhibit A: Southern Conference
basketball this year. After being picked
the 1985 consensus cellar-dweller by the
“experts,” the Cats have exploded to a 3—
0 conference-leading record.

Granted, it’s early, but last week’s
impressive 70-68 overtime victory at
Appalachian State put some legitimacy
into their conference surge.

The game typified past matchups be-
tween the two teams. This was the
seventh one in the last 10 to be decided
by two points, three of which went into
overtime. And with such deafening
crowd roars (a contingency of Hoddies
providing the grandstand support) and
last-second heroics, this “Thriller in
Boone” did nothing more than add to the
rivalry.

The instigator of such drama was 6
foot, 160-pound point guard Derek
Rucker. With the score tied at 68 and six
seconds left on the clock, the freshman
from Cleveland took a pass from sopho-
more Ace Tanner, made a couple of
jukes, and then sank a 22-foot jumper at
the buzzer.

Anyone who is surprised that such a
newcomer could perform so fearlessly
missed out on coach Bobby Hussey’s

pre-season comments
Rucker.

“He’s simply cold-blooded,” Hussey
said. ‘Nothing phases him. He’s the
player you want to bring the ball up the
court during the last seconds of a tied
basketball game.” Maybe not from
Moses, but prophetic words indeed.

Rucker wasn’t the only star. Tanner
and junior Pepper Bego both had 13
points, and the enforcer, junior Gerry
Born, pulled down 11 rebounds while
scoring 12 points.

Don’t fret if you missed this one.
Mark Feb. 4 on your calender, the date of
ASU’s return to Charlotte Coliseum to
seek revenge. Probably, it will be the
“Same ol’ story.”

Tomorrow night, the Cats host the al-
ways-tough Thundering Herd of Mar-
shall. Despite hovering around the .500
mark, the Herd is “the team to beat” in
the conference featuring a “kamikaze”
squandron of basketball talent. Expect a
high-scoring affair.

Don’t cry for Marshall. As soon as
Davidson had left Boone, the Herd rolled
in and rolled the Mountaineers by 19. If
the Cats win this one and move to 40 in
the conference, those pre-season prog-
nosticators may wish they had spent
more time looking at the team east of
Boone and south of West Virginia.

IMAC Wrestlers Win
Against Furman, Pfeiffer

By MIKE ADAMS

The Davidson wrestling team is off to
a fast start. The Wildcats have won their
first two matches against Furman and
Pfeiffer.

Saturday, the Cats beat Furman in
Greenville, 33-15. The match opened
with freshman Steve Lau losing 7-0.
Freshman Carl Ailara opened the scoring
for Davidson with a 4—0 decision at 126
pounds. Junior Taylor Simpson lost a
tough 7-2 decision to Furman’s best
wrestler.

Davidson won the next three
matches, with sophomore J. T. Lay and
senior Brad Essman taking forfeits and
senior Mike Keeley registering a first-
period pin. Freshmen Keith Finch and

Doug Saintsing lost decisions and junior
Griff Elder and freshman Tim Heinze
closed the scoring for the Cats with pins.

Against a tougher Pfeiffer team, the
Wildcats again performed well, winning
33-24. Lau was pinned, and Ailara lost
by default on a shoulder injury, putting
the Cats down 12-0.

Davidson lost only two more
matches, however. Lay, Essman, Saints-
ing, and Heintze won by pins. Simpson
won a decision and Keeley won by de-
fault.

Senior Tom Oddo, who was sup-
posed to be one of the Cats’ best
wrestlers this year, is no longer wrestl-
ing. He has decided to become an assis-
tant to Head Coach Bob Guarini.

End Of The World Leads In Street Hockey

By ANDY BARRON

Street hockey has been a part of
IMAC for only a few seasons, but par-
ticipation has mushroomed to eleven
teams this year. With enthusiasm and
skill at all time highs, street hockey
should have a banner year.

The program boasts two divisions,
one with six teams, the other with five.
Each team will play every team in its di-
vision, and possibly one in the other divi-
sion. The top eight teams will make the
play-offs to determine the league cham-
pion.

Talent in the league ranges from
novices galore to veterans of high school
ice hockey teams. At the top of the talent

heap are senior Mike Lufkin and junior
Sedge Gray. Both are playing for End of
the World, an assortment of multi-
talented individuals. Lufkin and Gray
alone make a tough team. Unfortunately
for the other teams, the rest of End of the
World can play solid hockey. End of the
World is 2-0 after beating What the Puck
8-1 and Immovable Object 4-0. The
next opponent/victim is Banana Ham-
mocks. End of the World is definitely the
team to beat.

The two teams with the best chance to
do that are Irresistable Force and Immov-
able Object. Both teams were formed on
3rd Sentelle, though not all teams mem-
bers came from that hockey hotbed.
These two teams have proven street hoc-

key is definitely addicitive and their hard
work could make one league champion.

Immovable Object, as previously
cited, couldn’t stop End of the World.
However, What the Puck felt Immovable
Object’s wrath as the Object won 12-2 to
be 1-1. Sophomore Emil Cekada had 5
goals in that game. Irresistable Force has
lived up to its name so far, beating
F.0.0.D. 8-0 and Gliques Glizzards 7-
0. Freshman Josh Budde has scored 13
goals as the Force’s designated scorer.
The Force has had trouble getting every-
one to shuw up for games. The team will
need everyone if it hopes to win it all.
Anyone who wants to find out what hap-
pens when an Irresistable Force meets an
Immovable Object should come watch

on Sunday.

Fraternity rivalries have yet to devel-
op the intensity in hockey that they have
in other IMAC sports. Only SAE, Fiji,
and Phi Delt have teams, and only the
Fiji’s are having much success. The Fiji
team, Dominating Bears, is 2-0 after
beating SAE’s Gliques Glizzards 3~2
and Phi Delt’s Bendecko’s II 4-2. Satur-
day will see two undefeated teams play,
Dominating Bears and Irresistable
Force. It will be a big test for both teams.

Though some teams have already

. made their case as great hockey teams,

the season has a long way to go — lots of

goals, saves, upsets, and good, hard
checks before the champion is crowned.
