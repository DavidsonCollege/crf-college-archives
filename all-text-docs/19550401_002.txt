Miss Doreas Midd Nite
announces sale today

The Davidsonian, the news and editorial voice of David-
son College, has been sold to the nationwide Nite newspaper
chain, it was announced today by the Publications Board,
former owner of the paper. The sale price was not disclosed.

Officials would not comment on the sale other than to
say, “We believe it is a good thing.” Informed sources close
to the Davidsonian (two doors down) stated that the sale was
dictated by necessity. They said that the newspaper was show-
ing definite signs of joining the college magazine in the Deficit
Spenders Club and that such a tendency could not be per-

to Denmark, where he spent a
week at the grave of Kierkegaard.

Gragg, for many years an out-
standing outhor and news com-
mentator, journeyed to Denmark
“to take in the exotic philosophy
of the brooding Danish theologian
of the nineteenth century and to
breathe the yellow air of the crisp
Danish mornings.” Most noticeable

change in Gragg’s physical stat-
ure and complexion.

gym on April

The interfraternity Council has
signed Joseph Roisman and_ his
Budapest String Quartet to rock
Johnston Gym to the patter of two
thousand fancy, flying feet at
Spring Frolics, April 22 and 23.
Following such hot jazzists as
Andrei Kostelanetz and Guy Lom-
bardo, the quartet’s cool renditions
of the latest Wagnerian and
Sibelian arrangements will provide

‘Gilbert Gragg, Davidson senior a welcome change from Dixieland

to improvised progressive jazz.

Repeated failures to come to
terms with Arthur Smith and His
Crackerjacks, frequent performers
before packed audiences of the
musical elite in Charlotte's Barn,
resulted in selection of the Buda-
pest group. This decision has re-
ceived commendation from stu-
dents and faculty alike. Sample
comments include “Cool, Daddy!”
(Dr. C. K. Brown), “Hip!” (Miss
Nell Shinn), and “Arrgh” (one of
the hairier among the undergrad.
uate academicians).

The Quartet has appeared be-
fore clamorous crowds of crazy
cats at San Francisco’s Horse
House, New York's Swillage Stand-
guard, and at aristocratic recherche
Mars Hill College. They are recent-
ly returned from a concert tour of
the Iredell area including Hidden.
ite, East Monbo, and Mount
Mourne, during which expendition
they enthralled formerly Brahms-
Bach-Beethoven devotees with the
ultimate in progressive jazz.

Accompanying the combo are
vivacious, verdurously hirstute
Urgsulgrude Blunstrickner and
Yma Sumac. The former is a Latin
beauty of the Velma Middleton
school of balladists; Miss Sumae is
of the raucous Eskimo group
typified by Sister Rosetta Sharpe.

BUDAPEST STRING QUARTET
The Budapest band has recorded
on the Bzzt label some of the more
popular dance numbers of the
day, such as “Carpathian Pas-
torale,” “Fugue for F Flat,”
and “Ugandan Rhapsody.”

The aggregation was __ first
formed under domination of Fritz-
Franz, a disenchanted French
ROTC Legionnaire. Members of
the present band include Roisman
at Ast violin, Boris Kroyt at viola,
James Gorodetzky at 2nd violin
and Mischa Schneider at cello.

The Interfraternity Council has
hired a highly successful Greens-
boro rainmaker to insure appro-
priate atmospheric conditions .con-
ducive to the’ party spirit.

Tickets will go on sale today at
Copeland's Department Store, the
Chez Shaw Smith, and Cridle-
baugh’s East End Concession.

‘red’ Davidsonian

Phi Beta Kappa has demanded an
investigation of the Davidsonien
for subversive elements. B. C.
Brown, spokesman for the group
of intellectuals, announced last
night that the demand was made
only after a thorough consideration
of the facts in the case.

“We feel it is our duty to pro-
tect the intellectual integrity of
our cultural heritage from the
vicious onslaughts of an irrespon-
sible clique of iconoclasts—and
the Davidsonian shows irrefutable
signs of constituting such a clique,”
he stated.

Evidence considered by the Phi
Betes included the newspaper's
support of the new cut system, the
Supreme Court, the microfilm
projector, and Soren Kiekegaard.

“Pure red radicalism!" said
Brown. “All of these questions
.| wexe supported to the hilt by local
cell number 4319, Communist
party of America. We have con-
clusive evidence that Gilbert Gragg
is a member, and possibly others
are fellow-travelers. We do not
believe Brockmann is implicated—
he ts simply a tool of the subver-
sives.”

Brown added that the Davidso-
nian had been suspected since the
time it reprinted the “Communist
Manifesto” on the editorial page,
but nothing was done at that time
since evidence was not conclusive.

Moles, McGillicuddy
shipped for imbibing

At a meeting of the Student
Council held recently, two stu-
dents, Specks Moles and Peyton
McGillicuddy were dismissed from
school for the “possession and use
of illicit beverages on the Davidson
College campus.” ;

In a well-planned move, mem-
bers of the Student Council
descended upon the lavish apart-
ment occupied by Mr. McGillicuddy
in East dormitory here. Overcome

: | by the surprise raid, Mac quickly

indicated the location of the il-
licit booze. Behind a false wall in
his bedroom were secreted 4000
cases of tax-paid (red) liquor. Stu-
dent Body President Floyd F.
Feeney declared that this was “the
largest cache of whisky ever un-
covered in East dormitory.”

The second apprehension was
made as the cache was broken
open. Mr. Moles’ only comment at
being discovered thus was, “Hic.”

Friends of ‘Mr. Moles may
reach him by addressing the
Schenley Industries, Louisville, Ky.

Miss Dorcas Midd Nite, president
of the chain, told reporters, “The
purchase of the Davidsonian is
just part of our policy to provide
uniformtiy among college news-
papers. We are negotiating with
the Lenoir-Rhynean now, and
eventually we hope to take over
even the Daily Tar Heel.”

When asked about the editorial
policy of her organization, Miss
Nite said, “As far as we are con-
cerned, Brockmann. will continue
as editor. He has proved to be a
very innocuous nonentity, although
I understand he was elected on
a ‘rabble-rousing’ platform. If he
begins to get out of hand, we can
always invoke the constitutional
clause which calls for annual eleec-
tion of editors. I do not believe
this will be necessary, however.”

The Nite chain includes the
Cactus Junction Foghorn, the
California Kilowhet?, and the Cor-
nelius Ctarion -Times -Tribune-Post-
Gazette - News - Bulletin-Record-Ob-
server-Journal. Star- Bugle - Citizen-
Ledger.

The latter is a 4-times daily, 6
times on Sunday newspaper with
the motto “All the news that’s fit
to print and all the news that fits,
we print.” It’s the result of a
gigantic merger which delighted
Miss Nite. Said she, “Competition
is so vulgar—and so apt to point
out mistakes.

“As soon as we control the major
college newspapers, all the sense-
less bickering and the raising of
spurious issues will cease. Ah,
won’t that be heaven on earth!
Don't you think so?”

D. Grier Martin, Davidson Col- | gue
lege treasurer, released this week; *

the room furnishing plans for the
$800,000 W. H. Belk Hall, which
will open next fall for the slumber-

some benefit of some 300 David-

son students.

Furnished entirely from the bar-
gain basements of Belks Stores
throughout the Carolinas, the
dorm rooms will feature plush love
seats with twin desks, dehumidized
closets, deoderized heads, dehu-
manized hall prayer meetings, tele-
scopes in the upper two floors, two
single beds for each room, and
one modernesque ceiling lamp, the
patented “da vinci junior.”

Light or Learning

“The da vinci junior,” said Mr.
Martin,” is one of the unique fea-
tures of the new dorm, having di-
rected beams to six places in the
rooms. Two beams go to the desks,
two to the students’ pillows for
reading bedtime stories, and two
to the shoe case in the closets, so
that the sheen of ROTC footwear
might show up to the best advan-
tage during the federal inspection.”
Costing $400.00 apiece, the da vinci
lamps were bought at sacrifice of
the library allotment for the next
three years. Said official college
sources, it is part of the reformed
tradition that light must come

before learning.

Football Uniforms

Commenting upon further
furnishings for the rooms, Martin
stated that each room will be
furnished with two football uni-
forms. This move was an after-
thought presented forcibly by
3000 alumni in a march from Char-
lotte called “Davidson over Notre
Dame or Protestantism Will Die,”
in which the alumni expressed the
desire on the part of well-wishers
to this community that we not for-
get our obligation to the athletic
world. Martin indicated that the
money required for purchase of
the uniforms wil) be obtained from
library funds for the years 1060-63.
