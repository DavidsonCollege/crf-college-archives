CAT CHAT

By LACY MacLEAN

|

The first real test for Davidson’s cagers is ahead of them. |

They tangle with Carolina Saturday night in Charlotte in what |

is growing into an annual Queen City classic. It is one of the |

first of the important conference engagements each year, and |
this winter its pushed up even more than usual.

A Little History

Despite the usual superiority of the White Phantoms on
the hardwood, each of the contests has been tops for spec-
tator interest, and this year may not be out of line. Last
fall the Wildcats took the floor as definite underdogs, but
they held Gorgeous George Glamack in check and tallied
a few themselves, and made it an exceedingly fast game
until-reserve-strength began telling on them late in the
game. The game last year were in Winston-Salem and
Chapel Hill, and Davidsons lost them both by an eight point
margin 38-30, and 39-31, but they. achieved what few other
teams in the South were able to do, hold the high flying
Phantoms down to a low score, and best All-American Gla-
mack with an individual rival.

This year Carolina has been forced to remodel her attack
to a great extent. Glamack’s unorthodox firing ability had
foreed the Heels into a mode of attack which was hot with
the big boy, but nothing without him, and this year he's gone,
leaving Coach Bill Lange in somewhat of hole. To meet the
situation the Carolina board of strategy decided to shift 6-4
inch Bob Rose, a starter at forward last year to the center spot.
Rose, an excellent ball handler and floor man can also shoot
the pellet with the best of them, and the Phantom’s may pre-
sent a more balanced and orthodox system than they used be-
fore. There is no doubt that their talent is superior to ours, but
if they are still having trouble with a new kind of basketball,
afi if the Cats have an on night, the chances are fitty-fifty.

Cat Strategy

In the way of changing systems, Davidson has done a
little on her own hook. In the first two games of the year
Coach Shepard concentrated on the two men in, with three
out system: that is two men went down into the two
corners under the Davidson basket leaving three men on
the outside to work the ball in to them. But lately, the
strategy has been modified to a certain extent. The Cats
have shifted occasionally to the opposite strategy with
three men close in and two bringing the ball down the
court.

The first mentioned plan is designed for an open or clear
center, and the, points must be made from shots’ when the
players are breaking toward the basket, thus the center should
not be congested so that they could’nt make their breaks to-
ward the basket. In the new system the plan is more one of

The Preliminary

As a preliminary match to the varsity game, the frosh
squad tangles with Central High of Charlotte. The Char-
lotte Silver Streaks will form perhaps the toughest opposi-
tion that the Kittens have seen yet and will prove some-
what of a testing ground for them too. In Practice and
against the teams that they’ve played so far, especially
against Pheiffer Junior College last Saturday, they looked
almost to good to be true.

The first combination of Tommy and George Peters, Abie
Chort, Harry~Hudson, and Jackie Byrd, look like the best
frosh five in years.and they’ve got a bunch of good reserves
right behind them. Flop Shaw, Heywood Brinnegar, Jim
Lowry, Sammy Yarbrough, Bill Sutton and others are pushing
hard for first team posts, and may see them. The Kits should
mop up the floor with the Streaks, and it'll be good to see them
looking like a big league ball club.

FROM DAVIDSON—

It’s really not much of a problem —
deciding how to go home for the
Holidays. Just follow the crowd —
your crowd — and you’re sure to find
yourself aboard a Greyhound Super-
Coach. Or if you’d rather sit down
and figure the matter out carefully,
logically, practically, you'll end up
the same place —for the big saving
on Greyhound’s low round-trip fares
is a pretty effective , mind-maker-
upper! Merry Christmas — Happy
New Year! t
