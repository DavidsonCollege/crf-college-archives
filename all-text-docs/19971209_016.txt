The Davidson wrestling team con-
tinued its 1997-98 campaign with a
meet against Anderson College Satur-
day.

Before this weekend, the: season
thus far had consisted of two tourna-
ments at VMI and Appalachian St.

The very young Wildcat team has
shown surprisingly good results in these
two tournaments. 5

“So far we’ve got a great start,”
coach Tom
Oddo said.
“If we can
SES ST
healthy, this
should be
our stron-
gest lineup
yet.”

This
Saturday’s
match re-
sulted in an
unfortunate
18-18 tie to
Anderson.

The Wildcats clearly dominated
the meet and won most of the matches,
but due to the injury of senior co-cap-
tain George Escaravage, Davidson was
forced to forfeit the 134-pound weight
class.

This forfeit cost the Wildcats a
devastating six points, which was clearly
a factor in Anderson’s ability to salvage
the tie.

After the regulation meet, both
teams continued to wrestle exhibition
matches.

The Wildcats continued to wrestle
well, winning 15 out of a total of 23
matches on the day.

“Overall, we wrestled incredibly
well,” Oddo said. “We were in all the
matches.”

Individually, the Davidson wres-
tlers were also successful.

Andy Sterling, rookie Anthony
Albert, and Ian Kaplan— with two pins
— all finished 2-0 on the day.

@ fan Kaplan works to pin an Appalachian St. wrestler in a meet earlier this season. Kaplan registered two pins
Saturday against Anderson, as the Wildcats notched a tie in their first dual meet of the year.

Perhaps more impressive was that
Sterling and Albert were both wrestling
out of their customary weight classes.

Bo Bickerstaff also had a win in
the regulation match.

Jeff Libersat, another rookie, also
contributed, finishing 1-1 against one
of the toughest wrestlers on the Ander-
son squad.

“The freshmen are coming in and
making an immediate impact on the
team,” said senior Bill Cameron, who
had a pin in one of the exhibition
matches, his second of the year.

“All the guys on the team are re-

ally pushing each other.”

Oddo believes the freshmen and
sophomore wrestlers are very promis-
ing this season.

Albert and Libersat proved their
worth in the meet this Saturday, as did
sophomores Bickerstaff and Kaplan.

Another second-year grappler,
Miles Cox, will be very valuable to the
team this season. A selection to the All-
Conference team last year as a mere
rookie, he lost his match Saturday by a
score of 3-2.

The squad finished last season on
a high note at the conference tourna-

ment. In addition to Cox making the
all-conference squad, Ben Wall, now a
co-captain, advanced to the finals of the
tournament and became the first David-
son wrestler to finish second in the
conference in recent history.

The team is hoping that the enthu-
siasm with which the 1996-97 cam-
paign ended will carry over to this sea-
son. :

Rob Vogelbacher and Thomas
Greene were the only seniors that the
team lost to graduation. The Wildcat
roster now consists of seven seniors as
well as a solid young corps.

“We had some guys step up and
win some really big matches,” Cameron
said.

“Once everybody gets to their ap-
propriate weight classes, we should bea
much more formidable team.”

The team’s performance so far this
season has been good, despite Saturday’s
tie versus Anderson.

The team’s draw in the match does
not hide the fact that Davidson was
clearly the better of the two squads.

When the team is healthy, it’s se-
nior leadership and young talent should
combine to produce good results.
