LAST WEEK'S GAMES.

On Mondar the team went over to
Gastonia to play ‘Friniev, but because
of the rain it was impossible to play.

The next ame was -w ith “Trinity,
and the Methodists won 6 to 4, al-
though. outplaved by, the Electric Ma-
chine.” Bill Osteen pitched a beautiful
game,. just as he had against Oak
Ridge, but we had hard luck again and
lost. Up until the seventh it looked
like Davidson had the game “sewed
up,’ but this frame has often been a
hard luck one for the Electrics, and this
was the time Trinity won. In the third
Osteen drove in one run, and “Pete”
came up after him and slashed one to
the left garden, scoring two. In the
seventh, with two men on, Kanipe
stepped to the plate and pounded one to
right field, which Keesler wase unable to
hold, and two scored. Two hits fol-
lowered, scoring two more.

As usual, the ninth inning rally came:
Currie batting for Watkins hit safe to
right, Kluttz hit safe to center, and
Currie goes to second. —_ Keesler’s
grounder «was fumbled and = the bases
were drunk. Victory was almost with=.
in grasping distance, and the rooters
were almost wild. Stough looked dan-
gerous and was walked. Bill came up
and made a mighty swing, but the ball
glanced off his bat and went to the
pitcher, who threw to plare and cut-off
Klurez. and Osteen. was out -on double
Rox score:

SHORE TOO MUCIL.

‘The last game was a‘ victory for the
Guilford pitcher. Tt was not Guilford
that defeated the Red and ‘Black Ma-
chine, but. it was Shore. He certainly
had evervthing that a pitcher should
have. Still the game would have been
different if Murphy Currie’s finger had
not been sore, which greatly handi-
capped him.

Guilford made the majority of their
scores in the seventh, when with the
bases full, one was walked in, a passed

ball by the catcher, and a hit scored the
others.

Shore struck out 16 men. The final
result of she game was 7 to 4 in favor

of Guilford.

CORALINA TO PLAY.

In last issue it was stated that this
game had been cancelled, but since that
time Manager Robeson has received a
wire saying that since they had to can-
cel a game on account of rain that they
will be permitted this game off the
Hill. It is to be olayed on the regular
date. April 21, in Charlotte. It is
gratifying to know that the Red -and
Blacks will get a chance at the Uni-|
versity lad=. *

On ‘Thursday afternoon in a practice
game the Federals in a six inning con-
test won over the regulars 3 to 2. “The
pitching of James, the fielding of Choate
at first and McDonald at short, featured.
The Federals are developing some good
future Varsity material, and is a good
thing, since Davidson only has one dia-
mond,” and there are others here who
can be developed into good players.

On Saturday the Feds went to Con-
cord in autos and there lost 4 to 1. Pa-
nella pitched for the Feds, and “Ding’
Bell for Concord. After the second in-
ning Panella was invincible.

GOL.

Dr. Arbuckle has certainly been un-
tiring in his efforts to get golf started
here at Davidson. ‘The course has been
finished now, and considering the
many difficulties. te be overcome in get-
ting it in shape, much credit is due to
“Dr.” and those who helped him. “The
members of the Faculty and same others
are keeping the course “red-hot” these
pretty afternoons. Professor Currie is
developing inte something of a star
