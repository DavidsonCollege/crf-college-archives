Affiliation Plan Adopted

By FRANKLIN ANDERSON
Staff Writer
The faculty unanimously ap-
proved the total affiliation plan
Tuesday and changed the pro-
cedure on adoption of the new
faculty constitution.

The affiliation plan, which was
proposed by the IFC's Fraterni-
ty Affiliation Committee, would
offer social affiliation to a fra-
ternity to all who wanted it.

A result of faculty action in
February. 1966, the proposal re-
quires that fraternities devise a
plan which would allow all
freshmen to affiliate with a fra-
ternity.

The 1966 action was suggested
by the Social Life Evaluation
Committee, which also recom-
mended second semester rush.

The faculty thanked the stu-
dents who participated, an ac-
tion which Fred Sackett, assist-
ant to the president, termed ‘‘a
high and unique tribute’’ from
the faculty.

The proposal will offer to each
rushee one of two types of bids.
Type A would offer the rushee
either pledgeship or social affil-
jation at the fraternity for as

long as the rushee wanted.

A Type B bid would offer to
a rushee an opportunity for so-
cial affiliation, with the oppor-
tunity to change fraternities aft-
er two months.

However, in order for a recip-
ient of a Type B bid to remain
an affiliate, he would have tu
enter rush every year.

“It demonstrates that when
students are given an opportun-
ity to work within reasonable

guidelines, they will respond not
only positively but maturely and
creatively,” said Tom Coving-
ton, fraternity liaison officer and
a member of the Fraternity Af-
filiation Committee.

Covington added that he was
“enthusiastic about the pro-
gram" because he feels ‘‘confi-
dent that fraternity men will re-
spond to jt and make it work,
and, of equal importance," be-
cause “it is an entirely new re-

adoption of the constitution.
which will be considered in
April. to three-fourths of the
faculty present at the April
meeting.

Under the old method, which
required approval by three-
fourths of the faculty in resi-
dence. failure to attend the
meeting would have constituted
a vote against the constitution.

Faculty Compensates
For No Summer School

The faculty approved two ma-
jor changes in Davidson's sum-
mer school policy at their meet-
ing Tuesday.

The changes come as a result
of the fact that Davidson will
not conduct any summer school
sessions this summer.

The major change is that in
cases of quality-point deficien-
cies in meeting year-end or re-

admission requirements, approv-
ed summer school work will be
accepted, though official credit
will still be limited to the num-
ber of hours and an equal num-
ber of points in courses where a
grade of C or better is earned.

The other change is that cours-
es which cannot be feasibly ap-
proved by the head of a depart-
ment may be approved by the

RAUN MacKINNON

Named Wilson Fellows

Seniors Hamp Morris and Ce-
cil Wooten have been awarded
Woodrow Wilson Fellowships for
1967-68.

Morris, from Geneva, Ala., is
majoring in French, and Woot-
en, from Kinston. N. C., in
classics. Both plan to be college
professors.

As Woodrow Wilson Fellows
hey will receive one academic

- {year of graduate education (with

tuition and fees paid by the
Woodrow Wilson Foundation)
and a Jiving allowance of $2,000.
In addition the foundation will
award a supplementary grant to
the graduate school where each
Fellow chooses to enroll, to be
used mostly for fellowships for

‘advanced graduate students.

Neither student has finally de-

cided which graduate schoo! he
will attend.

Morris and Wooten were
among 1,259 students selected
from 13,596 competitors repre-
senting 1,022 colleges in the
United States and Canada. They
were nominated by faculty. mem.
bers for ‘giving promise of be-
coming valuable members of
the academic profession."

“Never in the history of our
program have. we had to turn
down so many , outstandingly
good people,"’ commented Sir
Hugh Taylor. president of the
foundation, whe announced the
winners.

Both Davidson students have
been regulars on the dean's list

dean of students.

Otherwise students should fol-
low this long-standing proced-
ure:

—Secure an official bulletin
from the summer school of a
regionally accredited college or
university;

—With the help and approval
of his faculty or major adviser
select courses to be taken:

—Take the bulletin and the
list of proposed courses to the
corresponding department heads
at Davidson College and secure
approval in writing for the ac-
ceptance of the course for Da-

trar and leave it with him, re-
ceiving in exchange a form au-
thorizing the student to attend
summer school elsewhere as a
visiting student with credits in
specified courses to be trans-

—Make specific arrangements
for an official transcript to be
sent to the Registrar promptly
after the close of the summer
school. No grades are recorded
at Davidson, however.

Poel, Scientist Set
For Lectureships

Reynold's Lectureships for the
spring term of 1967 have been
accepted by Paul Green and Ja-
cob Bronowski.

“A third, Morganthau, had ac-
cepted."’ said Frontis W. John-
ston, dean of faculty, ‘“‘but he
found it necessary to cancel
out.” He will be here next fall
instead, said Johnston.

Born in 1894, Green, a native
North Carolinian, was educated
at the University of North Caro-
lina and Cornell University. In
1927 Green received the Pulitzer
Prize for the best American
olay. In Abraham’s Bosom.

The second Reynold's lecturer
will be Dr. Jacob Bronowski.
Born in Poland in 1908, Bronow-
ski lived on the continent dur-
ing his early years. Later, he
was educated in England and
received his PhD from Cam.
bridge. Leaving his post of uni-
versity professor in 1942, Bro-
nowski worked with British eco-
nomic problems during World
War II.

Green is expected on campus

signing a ‘Help Stop the War in
Vietnam" advertisement that
appeared in the Sunday, March
12 issue of The New York
Times.

Patterson says. ‘This was,
done on a personal basis. I was
disappointed at the few repre-
sentatives from southern univer-
sities and especially from Da-
vidson College and other church-
related colleges in the South.”

Duke University was the only
North Carolina school that had
enough names to be listed as a
separate institution. It listed 32
names.

The only other names from
North Carolina were those of
the three Davidson professors
and Henry Sanoff. These were
listed under ‘‘other institutions”
under the North Carolina head-
ing. Patterson says that he does
not know Sanoff or the school
with which he is associated.

When asked how he learned
of the plans for the ad Patter-
son said he was a member of
several of the committees that
sponsored it and ‘they sent me
the application and forms for
proposed names and I sought to
locate signers among the David.
son faculty.”

The heaaline on the two and a
quarter page ad was ‘‘Educa-
tors Appeal to the American
People . . . Help Stop the War
in Vietnam.”

It went on. to urge an end to
the killing of American youth

E. F. PATTERSON

in light of ‘“‘more than 7,500 al-
ready dead protecting a corrupt
military dictatorship against the
wishes of the Vietnamese peo-
ple."

The ad condemned the kilting
of men, women and children in
Vietnam and the destruction of
crops in an already improver-
ished country.

The financial costs of the war
to the United States was also
scored before the protest went
on to ask that readers ‘Help
bring our boys home.”

The signers charged that the
reason for the continuance of
the war lies in the distortion of
facts about the war.

Davidsonian Hits Top
In Area Competition

THE DAVIDSONIAN has been
judged the best small college
newspaper in North and South
Carolina by the editors of the
Charlotte Observer and Char-
lotte News.

Two DAVIDSONIAN staffers

LOUIS LESESNE

also placed in the annual com-
petition: Editor Louis Lesesne
won a second place award in
the best editorial competition
and an honorable mention in
the best news story division,
and Sports Editor Tom Cook re-
ceived an honorable mention ih
the sports competition.

Lesesne received a $50 prize
for editing the best newspaper
and $15 for his place in the edi-
torial division.

“This newspaper has some en-
terprising editors or some ingen-
jous reporters—probably both,"
said the judges. ‘It covered the
significant news and took pains
to explain what it meant and
why it was significant. It show-
ed imagination and resourceful-
ness in developing below-the-
surface stories."

Basic College Changes

Pres. Martin Gets

Proposals

Today

Manifesting “student concern over the future wel-
fare of Davidson College,” a student report advocating
changes in four areas of the college was presented ta
President D. Grier Martin this morning, Edward Dwelle.
spokesman for the group, announced this week.

The complete text of the re-

‘| port given to Martin is reprinted

in today’s DAVIDSONIAN on

|| page 4.

Seniors Dwelle, Bob Dugger,
Chuck Matthews and Charles
Vick headed the committee
which wrote the report which

proposes improvements in aca- '

demics. administration, athletics
and student life.

Among the changes proposed
in academics are larger political
science and sociology depart-

:|ments and an interdisciplinary

social science course. A compre-
hensive fine arts program and
conversion of the present college
union building into an art gal-
lery were also suggested.

The report recommended that
a more heterogenious student
body and administration be re-
cruited. Students from all sec-
tions of the country would be
beneficial to the college. A vacu-
um now present in the adminis
tration could be filled by a non
Navidson graduate as Provost.

Athletic scholarships should be
greatly altered. the report stat-
ed. Aid would be given only in
the case of financial need. The
athletic department would at-
tempt to serve the needs of a
greater portion of the student
body.

Reforms pertaining to social
life include a coordinate college
for women, additional dormito-
ries with Jounges and hall kitch-
ens and a new. expanded col-
lege union.

“It is a wholly student-orient-
ed report,’’ Dwelle said. ‘‘This
is a deadly serious attempt of
those who wrote it and signed it
to express their concern for the
college and its future welfare.

“We have not tried to be com-
prehensive even in the four
areas in which we have dealt.”
he said. ‘‘There are many more
ideas which are more useful than
these which we have expressed.
though we think these ideas in-
dicate the direction we would
like the college to take.”

The four students first met
about March | and got together
a group of 20 students who di-
vided up into committees ‘‘to
write reports which reflected
wat they hoped to be the con-
sensus of student opinion."’ The
committees met for about a
week and submitted their re-

the Dec. 2 issue, calling for a —

clarification of the college's pol-
icy on drinking.

There were a total of 368 en-
tries in the competition, from 26
colleges.

Council Vote Allows
Co-Advisors In Race

Student Council voted this
week not to allow two juniors
to run for the office of co-fresh-
man advisor and then rescind-
ed the motion in a special ses-
sion.

The original vote was taken
at the regular council meeting
Monday night. At that time the
decision was made not to let the
pair run, mainly on the argu-
ment that it might establish a
precedent of co-office holders.

An additional reason cited was
the complication of seating the
two on the Council. since By-
Laws provide for only one vote
for the freshman advisor.

At the special session held
Tuesday night, the two candi-
dates were allowed to present
heir reasons for running to-
gether and their solution to the

sometime during early April,| one-seat problem.

wd Bronowski in May.

After the two had made their

platform clear and had explain-
ed that they would run as ad-
visor and co-advisor, the coun-

cil decided to wave the previous |

ruling and allow them to run
together.

Also during the regular coun-
cil meeting a new ruling which
provided for a new arrangement
of cheerleaders was passed. The
council cited the greater enthu-
siasm in the lower classes as
they voted to redistribute the

cheerleaders among the classes. ~

Under the new ruling there will
be three seniors, three juniors,
and two sophomores on the
squad. replacing the old distri-
bution of 4 2-1.

In other business, the council
elected Jim Timmons and Ken
Autrey to aid Chuck Matthews
as advisors to next year's coun-
cil.

ports.

On March 10 the mimeograph
ed reports wére returned to the
committee members and they

- began soliciting signatures from

‘students.

“We feel that the report is
perhaps as constructive and well
written as we were able to do in
that amount of time.”’ Dwelle
explained. ‘‘We felt it was im-
portant to get the report out as
soon as possible to be considered
as a segment of student opinion
when the Blue Sky subcommit-
tees make their reports to the
Blue Sky Committee."

He added that the report in
no way attempts to take over
the Blue Sky Committee func-
tions. It does not attempt to cov-
er the broad scope of the Blue
Sky Committee. The library and
fraternities were left out because
it was felt enough attention had
been devoted to those areas.

Widespread support for the re-
port was found in gathering sig-
natures. Dwelle said, although a
large number of signatures was
not an objective.

‘A large number of those who
signed the report might place
their emphases on one area or
another, but they agree in prin-
ciple with the overall report.’’ he
stated.

“Humorously, we considered
naming the committee the
Brown Ground Committee in
contrast to the Blue Sky Com-
mittee. although no attempt is
being made to subvert or take
over the Blue Sky Committee.”
Dwelle said.
