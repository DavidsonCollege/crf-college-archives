NUMBER 16

Concert Is Given
By Eileen Farrell

On Monday evening, February 9,
a large group of the student body
heard the third concert of Davidson
College Artists Series, given by
Eileen Farrell in Chambers Audi-
torium. Miss Farrell is one of the
most famous sopranos of the
musical world today and has been
very highly acclaimed by many of
the critics.

Miss” Farrell's program
varied, beginning with several of
the classics and ending with several
lighter numbers. She was called
back for several encores by a de-
lighted audience Included in her
concert were Care Selv¥e by Handel,
Stanchen and several others by
Brahms, Aria, Pace, Pace Mio Dio,
from “La Forza del Destino” by
Verdi! Romance by Debussy;
Chere Nuit by Bachelet; Down by
the Sally Gardens, arranged by
Hughes; If Thou But Sing to Me
by Shaw; Through the Years by
Youmans and many other favorites.

Was

Miss Farrell was born into a
musical family, her father and
mother being headliners of the
vaudeville circuit known as the
singing ‘‘O'Farrells.” She = was
taught music all through her

younger days and in Woonsocket,
Rhode Island, where her family
finally settled, she was the star of
both their church and school activ-
ities. She was taught to love music
and steadily trained her soprano
voice. After several years study
she gave her first, audition in 1942
and was a smashing success.

Since her initial success, she has
traveled only the upward path to
greater successes and is now ac-
claimed over the nation, For the
past few years she has been one
of the leading sopranos in radio,
singing both popular and classical
songs. But her work in radio is
only a part of her career. She has
delighted audiences in many of the
leading theaters of America with
her golden-toned soprano voice and
the astounding range of her
repertoire. This music season finds
her making her first extended con-
cert tour, the American people
wishing to see Miss Farrell as well
as hear her. She hopes soon to take
opera in stride and her singing of
the great arias is indication that
the operatic stage will be her next
conquest.

Mrs. Eileen Farrell Reagan is a
happy “young married” as well as
a famous singer. Her only domes-
tic difficulty is that she doesn’t
have enough time to spend with
Robert Reagan, Jr, who is nine
months old .With all the incum-
bicies of a singer, Miss Farrell is
determined to take care of Robert,
Jr., herself, rather than have a
nurse to do it, although she has a
personal maid who takes care of
him when she is away.

During her six years of radio,
Eileen Farrell has brought musical
pleasure to hundreds of thousands,
from before a microphone .In ad-
dition to her own program,
rently heard over CBS from N 30
to midnight (EST), every Wednes-
day, she has starred: four successive

cur-

summers on the Prudential Family
Hour and has been guest artist on
many other programs

Commencement Date
Change Announced

announced

It was Monday in
chapel by Professor Beaty of the
Language Department, that. a
change in the schedule of this
semester had been made by the
faculty.

The original. college calendar
listed May 31 as the commence-
ment date The new date is May

22 through May 24. Exams for the
semester are from May 13 through
May 21. These dates are approxi-
mately one week earlier than those
noted in the college catalogue.
Spring recess has not changed. It
will be from 12:50 p. m., Mareh 25
to 8:25 a. m., March 30.

The revision of the
due to the fact that the General
Assembly of the Presbyterian
Church meets at such a time that

Is

schedule

would conflict with the original
commencement program, Dr, Cun-
ningham is the moderator of the

Assembly and could be absent from
neither event. Several members
the faculty and Board of Trustees
must also attend the Assembly and

ol

graduation. It would therefore be
impossible to allow the college
calendar to remain as it was

originally planned.
This change of schedule should
be received favorably by the stu-

dent body, because the change
causes the term to end about a
week early.

BULLETIN

L

Two hundred Southern Con-
ference tournament tickets were
placed on sale at the “New”
gym on Thursday, February
10th. The tourney, which will
be held on March 4, 5, and 6,
will determine the conference
cage champion. Set tickets are
priced at $9.00 each. Individual
game tickets will not be sold.

As yet the appearance of the
Wildcats in the Durham fracas
is not assured. However, last
night’s win over Clemson gave
the local’s seven wins in twelve
family starts, and if the present
pace is-maintained against. the
remaining opponents, The Cita-
del (2), Furman,’N..C. State
and Carolina, the Davidson
cagers should be among the

that time

top eight in the conference.
