Dukes Hit in Pinches
and Win Saturday Game

Davidson Shows Superiority in Field
But Unable to Hit Well—
Score 9-2

out of its losing streak in the game with
Duke University last Saturday, and lost to
that team 9-2, The Wildcats broke the ice
by placing a run in the right column in the
second inning. This was the last scoring
they did, however, until last frame, when
three successive hits by Laird, Wells and
Woodham pushed another tally across th
plate.

The game from the standpoint of fielding
was by far the best played by Davidson this
season, as no one made an error and most of
the throws were good. In hitting, too, the
Wildcats were on par with the victors as
they garnered only one less hit than Duke
was able to get, bu the Dukemen happened
to hit when men were on the patHS and when
runs were needed. One home run by Smith
and four two-baggers, one each by Pierce,
Johnson, and two by Chappell, and the wild-
ness of the Davidson pitchers accounted for
the heavy scoring by Duke.

Three Wildeat pitchers were used by
Coach Younger in a vain attempt to stop the
rush of Duke runs but none of them proved
to be very effective. Laird worked the first

the outfield and Hampton took up the burden.
He proved to be unable to stand the pace and
was replaced by Oden, who finished the
game.

SPORTOGRAPHS
By Ernest Milton

|

|
| The Freshman team seems to be a hard-
| hitting bunch. Nine men are hitting over

| 300 per cent.

| Three of these, though, do not play regu-
larly, but it means that six of the regulars
are hitting ‘em hard and far,

Two of these are pitchers, too. Poole has
jan average of .600, having got nine bingles
‘out of 15 trials. Maulden, who either pitches
or plays in the outfield, is hitting 344. »
Dulin, Arrowood, Johnson and Kugler are
‘the other regulars, while C. Cathey, Mc-
Geachey and Wilson are in the bracket above
them.

By the way, the team’s average is 308. It
must be considered, too, that they have been
up against some good opponents. The Rae-
ford boys are the ones that kept the average
from being perhaps 15 points higher.

Doc DeArmon’s lads are a hitting crew,
too. They almost defeated the Fresh last
Friday.

The schedule this week, the trip that they
are on now, will prove a true test of their
mettle.

You don't often see two men tagged oyt in
home within a second of each other. / But
that’s what happened in the Lowell game.

If the Freshmen can continue their record,
we ought to have some good varsity ma-
terial for next year.

However, when you consider that the var-
sity’s batting average is .247, that really is
not so bad. We just can’t hold them for
some reason or other.

The Wofford game started off fine, and
was a splendid game until the sixth, when
the lads from Spartanburg began touching
the offerings of Oden so freely that they
had a telling effect.

And Duke won her first varsity victory
from Davidson by a good margin in Greens-
boro Saturday.

This afternoon the tennis boys are playing
|the University of Virginia. You already
know whether they defeated the University
of Maryland and Navy.

We still have the Union Seminary team to
face, and the Winston-Salem Country Club.

This is a big trip for the tennis team, and
we are glad of it. We like to see Davidsen’s
teams, no matter what branch of sport, go up
against some of the bigger institutions.

Meeting Navy in tennis gave us two
| matches in the minor sports, to be sure, but
|

we met them just the same.

A]

Then Georgia Tech in basketball and golf,

even though they did beat us in the latter
| one.

Peppy Finish Over Lowell

| McGeachy Makes Unusual Play at
| Home Plate—Game Decided |
| Only in Last Moments

| “Lefty” Hawkins, of Lowell High School, |
tried to pitch two games in succession, de-
feating Charlotte High School and then
coming to pitch against the Davidson Fresh, |
but the strain was too great, and he weak- |
ened in the ninth inning. After having fan-|
|ned two men he walked Dulin, hit Arrowood, |
walked Edgar, and then hit Edwards, which
He had
pitched a great game, fanning 13 of the
Yearlings, who have been hitting hard this
season,

One of the most unusual plays ever wit-
nessed on Richardson field, and one which is
not likely to occur again, was when Usery, of
Lowell High, was on first, having singled, |
and with G. Hawkins at the bat. Hawkins
nailed out one to left field that looked good
for a homer, and being a fast runner he was
on the heels of Usery coming in home, Ed-
wards, in left field, fielded the ball quickly,
relayed it to Kugler, who shot it home in!
time for McGeachey to tag Usery out, as|
well as Hawkins, who was but a few feet
behind. But for this bad play on the part |
of Lowell they might have had the game. |
As it was, they proved to be a hard-hitting

outfit, much above the average of high
schools,

| Another thing which we like is Freshman
| teams in all of the sports.

It is a’natural assumption that we will
have them in football, basketball and baseball,
but just now we are thinking of the tennis
team, who defeated Charlotte Country Club
last Thursday.

It gives the boys a greater interest in their
sports, gives them a good training, and helps
Revidsan athletics in general.

Next year the raqueteers are going to need
some good men, and it’s up to the Freshman
class to advance some players.

Davidson has had the state championship
for three years now, Bradley holding it for
two years, with Harry Price copping it last
year in Greensboro.
