Article 10 of the College Constitution
provides: “There shall be a body to
be known as the Court of Control, It
shall be the duty of this court to hear,
investigate, and deal with the charges
of upperclassmen against freshmen for
improper conduct, such as jibing, vio-
lating freshmen regulations, or break-

recorder,

ing college traditions.” Section 5 of
this Article states: “This body shall
have the power to confine to the cam-

pus any freshman found guilty of an
offense not serious enough to warrant
suspension from college.” Other
Article 10 provide for the

his
sections of

membership and proceedings of the
body.

The Court of Control has met with
great success during the past two
years, both with upperclassmen and
freshmen, It has always been the pur-

pose of this court to maintain the prop-
er relations between the freshmen and
upperclassmen and to impress upon the
freshmen a desire to uphold the col-
lege’s traditions.

Class Speeches

Monday, June 4, will be Class Day,
a day traditionally set aside during the
commencement exercises for a get-to-
eether of the graduating class.

The exercises, which will be presid-
ed over by F. L. Smyre, president of
the class, will be held at 5:30 o'clock
in Chambers Auditorium. They will‘in-
clude the class valedictory speech by
Ee. J. Humphrey and the class saluta-
tory speech by L. H. Huie. These
speeches are distinguished from the
valedictory and salutatory speeches
held on commencement night, as the
speakers are selected by vote of the
class and not by scholarship.

Rawlings Pratt-Thomas will deliver
the class oration; W. L. Fugate will
give the class poem, and the class his-
torian, Alec McGeachy, will read the
class history. All the above officers
were elected at a recent class smoker,

torian during his sophomore year, as
is the custom. ;

Other plans for the occasion are in-
definite. It is possible that the Concert
