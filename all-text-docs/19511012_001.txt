Phi Gams Are AT O First With
Top Scholars (Pledge Project

This week Alpha Tau. Omega fraternity brought for the
first .time onto Davidson campus a practical application of the
idea of a constructive fraternity pledge period. A national trend
toward this has recently been illustrated in the movie, ‘“Take

Dean Bailey announced Monday
that the local chapter of Phi Gam-
mayDelta was number one frater-
ey; in scholarship for the school
year 1950-1951,

With an average of 1.680, the
Phi Gams were: closely followed
by the Sigma Chis with an aver-
age of 1.634 and the Kappa Sigs
with an average of 1.622. Retiring
from first position for last year
was Beta Theta Pi.

The fraternity men showed a
slight edge over the student
body average, 1.534 to 1.497.

The Phi Gams made a rapid rise
from their number six position of
last year, but their success cannot
be attributed to any one class. The
classes were generally even with
a steady drop from the seniors’
even B to the freshmen pledges
who dragged with an average of
0.92.

Eight of the members had
an average for the year of
better than 2.50.

The report of the fraternity aver-
ages covered all upperclassmen
who were members of fraternities
and all freshmen and upperclass-
men who were pledged to the fra-
ternities during the early part of
first semester.

Only students omitted in the
calculation were those who with-
drew from the college early in the
semester and for whom no perma-
nent grades were entered. In cal-
culating the averages the usual
system of computation was used
with an R subtracting 1.0 and an
F subtracting 2.0.

ceived of importance to all boys

ber 13, 1951, and the April 24,
1952. administrations of the
College Qualification Test are
now available at Selective

their existence, they must serve
the school and the community as
well. The Davidson chapter of the
ATO has permanently inaugurated
“Help Week” instead of the “Helt
Week.”

He hopes that the other David-
son fraternities will join ATO in
this. He pointed out that if every

pledge on the Davidson campus
worked as little as one or two
hours each = afternoon during

“Greek Week,” they could com-
plete such constructive jobs as mak-
ing a playground for the town’s
children, painting or repairing
houses of those who could not af-
ford to have it done, or similar
services.

Plenty of Work

ATO believes that this would
plenty of work for the
pledges and at the same time
harness the labor for the benefit
of the college and the community.

Court Avid On
School Spirit

Chapel proceedings for the Court
of Control will remain the same
as of recent years, with a court
meeting every Friday in chapel.
Johnny Guiton and Mae Mcl.ean
discussed this in a recent meeting
with Dr. Puckett about chapel con-
duct.

At this meeting the leaders
of the Court of Control and
the Student Government also
deplored the total lack of
school spirit shown by the stu-
dent body when so many boys
went home the weekend of the
Citadel game.

Guiton said that if the upper-
classmen would turn in the
names of the freshmen who
missed the game, the court
would help to remind those
boys to stay on campus for all
major sports in the future.

The group noted an improvement
in chapel conduct, but they feel
that they still need more co-opera-
tion from the upperclassmen.
Guiton expressed his appreciation
for the time and work Dr. Puckett
and his committee have put on
trying to improve the chapel pro-
grams,

The Pan Hellenic Council, as has
been the custom in the past, will

Here is a preview of some of the

Low Man

The Sigma Chis are sitting on
top of the world, or at least on
top of a twenty-five foot totem
pole, decorated with Indian de-
signs and through which shines
the white cross, emblem of this
fraternity. At the base of the pole
is a wildcat trampling a P.C. foot-
ball player. A sign nearby pro-
claims, “Presbyterian is now the
low man on our totem pole!”

Phi Gamma Delta welcomes
back its alumni with an inebriated
wildcat, in front of which is a
little wildcat chasing a blue-hosed
football player.

Stirring Wildcat

This week-end the Alpha Tau
Omega yard is a football field. On
the fifty yard line is a wildcat
stirting a pot and boiling a repre-
sentative of P. C.

The Pi Kappa Phis are tearing
the blue hose off the line. Their
decoration consists of three wild-
cats tearing blue socks off of a
clothesline and = another
laughing at the score of the foot-
ball game.

Soup for the KA’s

Blue Hose soup is the diet of
the Kappa Alpha Fraternity. Hlue
hosed football players are being
shaken out of a sock by wildeats
into a Heinz 58 variety can labeled
Blue Hose Soup.

Sigma Phi Epsilon ha. a s:eam
roller driven by a wildcat f‘aiten-
ing out blue-hosed football players,
and pushing down the Presbyterian
goal post which more football
players are trying to hold up.

Kappa Snapper

Kappa Sigma, winner of last
year’s decorations contest, plans
another animated decoration. With
a football stadium as a background,
a Davidson Wildcat will be snap-
ping at the heels of a fleeing Pres-
byterian ball carrier.

Each fraternity hopes to have
their house judged as the best dec-
orated. Which one will gain this
honor?

R. Cunningham's talk realized
the full impact of that alliterative
tab on time. For it truly has been
a “Decade. of Destiny” at Davidson
almost from the first moment of
Dr, Cunningham’s inauguration on
October 18, 1941. It has been a
decade that has seen the student
body increase by almost one-third;
a decade that saw the college
weather one of the major crises in
its 1ll5-year old history during
World War Il; a decade during’
which four niajor buildings were
added to the physical plant; and,
most important of all; a decade
which saw the spiritual life of the
campus deepened and the church
bonds of the college strengthened
—all Jargely achieved, through the
great leadership and guiding hand
of John Rood Cunningham.

A Best-Dressed
Man To Be Named

Davidson's best-dressed man will
be chosen at a Wednesday chapel
voting. The election is in conjunc-
tion with Men's Fashion Week
sponsored by the Men's Fashion
Guild of Charlotte and the David-

‘son Publications Board.

Each fraternity will nominate
one man as well as the Cam-
pus Club and independents. An
appropriate award will be given
the winner at a later date.

The purpose of the campaign is
to “inform the male population of
the meaning of being well-dressed.”
Also the “sense of security it gives
does not require a quantity of

‘clothes, but quality and taste.”
