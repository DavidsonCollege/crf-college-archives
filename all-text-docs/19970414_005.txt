THE DAVIDSONIAN

Sherry Adams was hired by
the Town of Davidson as the
“Downtown Program Manager.”
She works with the Davidson mer-
chants association as a town liai-
son, and spearheads an effort to
shape
Main
Street
into an
area
that is
attrac-
tive to
all fac-
ets of
t he
Davidson community.

And with the recent closure of
Cosmic Coffee, she has a big job
on her hands.

Although the sign on the door
says that the shop will only be
closed for a week, Adams con-
firms that the restaurant/coffee

shop will not stay open.

She sees this as part of a bigger
problem on the town’s main drag.
“What Main Street is lacking is a
business mix,” she says.

Stores are scattered, and focus
on very different crowds. Store-
front offices divert shoppers, and
student-oriented businesses are vir-
tually nonexistent.

Adams is working with the
Downtown Davidson Organization
by following “The Main Street Ap-
proach.”

This method, designed to help
small towns in need of economic
revitalization, focuses on working
with all areas of a community to
build a successful downtown.

She says that Davidson’s down-
town is not in dire straits, but could
use some help.

Part of her job is finding mer-
chants to open businesses in the
town. She hopes to keep Cosmic’s
space as acoffee shop, and has been
calling prospective investors to see
if they are interested.

However, she hopes that a
coffee shop is only the beginning.
“TI would love to see a music store,
video store, clothing store, lunch
place, or brewery come to
Davidson,” she says.

Adams would also like to see
an increase in the number of stores
on the street.

“We would like to keep store-
fronts retail-oriented. That in-
cludes restaurants. If we look at
Main Street froma marketing plan,
we want to cluster businesses to-
gether,” she says.

She has hopes for the
Davidson Mill, which will be reno-
vated within the next few years.
The old warehouse on Watson
Street will house shops and restau-
rants, creating another shopping
area in Davidson.

“Tam hoping that they will try
and put some middle-scale stores
there,” she says.

“Tt is all incremental steps,”
she says. “It has to all evolve
‘slowly.”

Student Health Fair: :
Counselors offer help to stressed-out students

By STEPHEN CEFALU
Staff Writer

As finals approach, the collec-
tive anxiety level among students
will begin to rise exponentially. To
combat this phenomenon, the coun-
selors at the Student Counseling
Center want students to know that
they are here to help.

Under the direction of Dr.
DeWitt Crosby, Student Counsel-
ing Center representatives will be
conducting anxiety disorder screen-
ings as part of the Student Health
Fair to be held this Wednesday,
April 16, from 11:30 a.m. to 2:00
p.m. on Chambers Lawn. During
the early part of this week, pam-
phlets and a videotape presentation
on anxiety disorders will also be
made available in the front lobby of
the College Union. :

Student Counseling Center
Director Dr. David Staton says the
purpose of the anxiety disorder
screenings is to heighten awareness
about what is one of the mst com-
monly diagnosed diseases every-
where.

“Too often people with anxiety
disorders think they’ re the only ones
experiencing them, and so they iso-
late themselves,” he says.

Staton cautions that there-is a
marked difference between com-

mon anxiety and that which consti- —

tutes ‘a disorder.
According to the National In-

stitute of Mental Health, “mental -

health professionals are not con-
cerned with normal anxiety. Rather,
they attend to fear and anxiety that
has somehow gone awry; that inex-
plicably reaches overwhelming lev-
els; that dramatically reduces or
eliminates productivity and signifi-
cantly intrudes on an individual’s
quality of life.”

The organization states that
nearly 25% of the adult population
of the United States experiences an
anxiety disorder at some point dur-
ing the course of their lives.

While the National Institute of
Mental Health’s third annual Na-
tional Anxiety Disorders Screening
Day will not, itself, occur until May
7, the organization encourages col-
lege campus communities to host
screenings atmoreconvenienttimes
during the academic year.

This year’s Anxiety Disorder
Screening Day will be Davidson’s
first. Originally slated for March,

the event was pushed back in order
to accommodate alcohol awareness
week programming.

- “We want to emphasize that
anxiety disorders do not in any way
involve an issue of character or will-
power,”..says..Dr,.Staton. “They
happen to all sorts of people in all
walks of life, and there are many
effective forms of treatment avail-
able.”

Fuentes rescues Spanish
canon from Fascist repression

By Wit BRADSHAW
Sports Editor

Victor Fuentes, profes-
sor at the University of Cali-
fornia-Santa Barbara, lectured
on the formation of the liter-
ary canon in twentieth-cen-
tury Spain on Monday and
Tuesday last week in the
Union. On Monday, Fuentes .
discussed the importance of
politics in Spanish literature,
particularly the twenty years
leading up to the Fascist Fran-
cisco Franco’s assent to power
in 1936. Much of Fuentes
work in this area centers

around recovering the works
of social protest which were buried
by the politics of the twenties and
thirties. His talk on Monday was
delivered in English in an attempt
to include the entire College com-
munity.

Fuentes changed gears on Tues-

_ day, delivering the lecture in Span-

ish and focusing on the bohemian
writers who emerged in early twen-
tieth-century Spain. These writers,

noted not only for their literary gifts
but their unconventional lifestyles,
were one of the silenced groups
during the turmoil of the Spanish
Civil War. However, the work of
both these groups is beginning to
re-surface due to the labor of schol-
ars such as Fuentes and a less re-
strictive Spanish government.

The Spanish department spon-
sored Fuentes’ lecturers.

Recruitment works for diversity

where they feel they are a part of the
turf. Because of the nature of the
environment, kids sometimes feel
like outsiders. The increases in
numbers will help that.”

Jenkins agrees. “There is a so-
cial issue at Davidson that crosses
all lines.- Students at Davidson tend
to be unexposed.” ;

She also says that African-
American numbers at Davidson are
lower because “Davidson is not a
name they have heard all of their

lives — it’s harder to get them to ~

apply. And the typical applicant
has so many choices.”

Despite the heavy recruitment,
however, Cable says students are
admitted for overall excellence.
“We consider it our charge to shape

_afreshman class. Consideration of

ethnic diversity is one part of what
we do. We don’t have black stu-
dents here just to have black stu-
dents, but to make it a stronger
academic place.”

“Tt is very exciting to see that
the issue of having a culturally di-
verse place is a concern of the com-
munity,” says Satterwhite. “The
College has real potential.”
