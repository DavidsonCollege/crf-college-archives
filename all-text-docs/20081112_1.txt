week. Seven
months after that his-
toric March, it has all started
again, and with a clean slate.

Both the women and men’s
teams tested out the hardwood in
exhibition games against Mars Hill
and Lenoir-Rhyne, respectively.
Both cruised to victory: the women
75-48, the men 87-53.

Neither match offered the dra-
ma soon to come when both teams
will face difficult out-of conference
dockets. The women will meet
strong competition in no. 12 Van-
derbilt on Nov. 28 and no. 22 Xavi-
er, the A1l0 favorite, on Dec. 19.
The men, meanwhile, will quickly
test just how greatly they will miss

to Norman,
Okla. next week
for the opening
rounds of the NIT Season Tip-Off
tournament where they will take on
the James Madison Dukes and, po-
tentially, no. 12 Oklahoma.

While the week’s Division I
opponents did not present the ath-
letic challenge that later foes will,
they did allow both team’s to ease
into the season. More importantly,
for us fans it was a chance to build
up tolerance for adrenaline-rushes
and scout out new faces.

The old stars returned in usual
form. For the women, Mercedes
Robinson ’09, Julia Paquette 10
and Alex Thompson ’10 had 20,
13 and 12 points, respectively. Ste-

The foundation selects 60 grad-

year to receive a travel grant of
$28,000 in order to pursue an inter-

tives and grow more aware of inter-
national issues.

Each game introduced intrigu-

that he could play a key role.

It was an auspicious beginning
for both teams, and a great relief for
fans that the months of exile from
Belk Arena have come to a close.
