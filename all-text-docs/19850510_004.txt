Griffith Replaces Powers In

By NELLE MCCORKLE

“Davidson is a wonderful
place to represent,” said Dr. John
V. Griffith, currently Dean of Ad-
missions and upcoming Vice pres-
ident for development. The Trus-
tees approved Griffith’s appoint-
ment in a May 3 meeting, and
Griffith will assume his new post
on July 1. Currently, a search is
underway for Griffith’s successor
as Dean of Admissions, according
to Ann Calahan of the Admissions
Office.

Griftith has served in his pre-
sent post since 1979. He will re-
place Dr. Jack Powers in De-
velopment; Powers has resigned
to assume an office at St. Andrews
Presbyterian College effective

: June |.

Calling the College “an in-
stitution that can be served well,”
Griffith spoke of his “immediate
realization upon coming to David-
son’ six years ago that progress

committee so far has been “to
secure estimates on renovat-
ing.”’ She cited redoing the win-
dows to save heat as a top prior-
ity, along with replacing the
ceiling. “I’ve tried to get esti-
mates and it’s slow.” She said
she does not know the exact cost
for the possible renovaton but
“we're talking a lot of money.”
Beth Maczka, former presi-

dent of the Y-Student Service
Corps, said the center “is hav-
ing trouble funding programs
like the Gethsemane tutoring
program. Because of funding,
we're cutting edges already.”
She said she hopes the center
gets financial help from the Col-

could be made quickly.”

During his tenure, Griffith
said, the Admissions Office has
made a “vigilant effort to maintain
its commitment to meet 100 per-
cent of each student’s established
need.” He said admissions has
consciously sought to widen
Davidson’s geographical distribu-
tion “but not at the expense of this
region.”

Of his interest in financial aid,
Griffith explained, “It’s hard to
imagine anyone at Davidson’s
being any more meritorious than
anyone else. We want to hold on
to making this education possible
for anyone the College considers
worthy of admission.”

Since Griffith took office, the
acceptance rate for applicants has
decreased from 50 percent to 33
percent. Of those accepted, 54
percent chose Davidson six years
ago; this year 59 percent selected
Davidson. Paralleling these shifts

is an increase in average Scholas-
tic Aptitude Test scores of those
accepted from 1180 in 1979 to
1230 in 1985.

Geographic distribution, Grif-
fith said, remains “roughly one-
third North Carolina, one-third
other Southern states, and one-
third the rest of the world.”

Griffith cited strengthening
alumni ties through the Davidson
Alumni Admissions program as
“effective in helping bring the best
students from the areas involved.”
Begun five years ago, the program
now includes 200 alumni in 23
cities.

Another developmnet during
Griffith’s tenure, the Davidson
Admissions Stimulation program
(DAS) is “basically a public rela-
tions activity,” Griffith said. DAS
brings secondary school college
counselors to the Davidson cam-
pus for a role-reversal version of
the admissions process: the secon-

dary school counselors act as Col-
lege admissions officers, intervie-
wing the real admissions staff.

Griffith described college ad-
missions as a “strange combina-
tion”. of “promotive” and
“academic counseling.” Today’s
college recruitment requires
“sophisticated marketing activity
going after dwindling resources in
an atmostphere of increased com-
petition.”

Griffith added “I hope those
basic skills transfer to develop-
ment.” In preparation for his new
job, he has spent “the last several
weeks talking with Development
and Communications Office
staffs.” He added, “I’m looking
forward to working with them.”

The College has set definite
goals for the Development Office,
Griffith said. The Annual Fund
campaign managed by Develop-
ment calls for a_ total of

$2,000,000. “This year’s special
effort,” Griffith said, will focus
on completion of Project 1987, re-
novating arts facilities, and “other
planned projects.”

Griffith’s new duties will in-
clude overseeing the Annual
Fund, a campaign drive which
also manages fundraising for the
Living Endowment, Wildcat Club
and WDAV radio station. The
Vice President for Development
also directs the Communcations
and Alumni Offices.

Griffith stressed involvement
of alumni, friends, foundations,
parents, and corporations in the
Annual Fund. According to Assis-
tant Director of the Living En-
dowment Gracia Slater, 62.3 per-
cent of the Annual Fund comes
from alumni donations. Without
these gifts and grants, Slater said,
each student would pay $1,867
more in annual tuition.

lege next year.

According to Johnson, the
center caters to many different
groups of people. The center
runs the hot meal program
through which 170 people daily
receive food.

She said the center houses a
county-run recreational center
for children, adult and a recrea-
tional programs, the county ex-
tension and income-producing
classes such as basketweaving
as participants can sell their
work.

The center also provides a
Crisis assistance ministry, inde-
pendent cultural studies for
youths such as piano and
drama, and Central Piedmont

College Bowl Update

By ANDREA DIEDRICH

With three out of four of the

members of the college bowl tearn
graduating this year, the Union
College Bowl Committee had to
do some recruiting for next year’s
team. Tim Waples, this year’s
captain, Chris Blake and David
Sisk will graduate this year.
Junior Sara Beasley. who is cur-
rently on the team, will be captain
of next year’s squad. Sophomore
Gordon Watkins, sophomore Jeff
Gregory and freshman Mark Chen
will replace the graduating
seniors, and sophomore Edwin
Page will be the alternate.

According to Beasley the
Union College Bowl Committee
organizes the intramural college
bow! league and in the process sc-
outs for players for the intermural
team.

College Bowl “involves a big
time commitment,” said Beasley.
The team practices almost every
day from 4 to 6 p.m. throughout
the year. Beasley said, “It’s like
playing a sport all year round.”

Dr. Hansford Epes, professor
of German and assistant director
of the Center for Special Studies is
the main caoch of the team. Mr.
Charlie Lloyd, professor
Emeritus, physics professor

ayre

Robert Manning and music pro-
fessor James Swisher also coach
the team.

This year’s team will go to
Berry College in Rome, Georgia
on May 10 and 11 for the South-

eastern Invitation to~defend their
title from last year as champions
of that tourn . Seven other

teams from the southeast will be
there.

According to Beasley, David-
son has not hosted a tournament in
about four years because of the
amount of time it takes to organize
one. She doesn’t foresee David-
son sponsoring one next year
either, but she thinks it is possible
they will hold a faculty challenge
match.

According 40 Beasley, the
team did poorly ft the regional
tournament at East Tennessee
State University in February.
They did much better at the Na-
‘ional Invitational Tournament at
Emory University in Atlanta in
April. Thirty-five schools partic-
pated in the tournament including
Dartmouth and Carleton. The
team played 13 matches in two
days.

William Brown, director of
the Union, was appointed official
regional college bow! director this
year.

holds various types of classes
there, she said.

If Federal Revenue Sharing
is cut from the federal budget,
the center will have to supple-
ment the $33,850 it would lose.
However, Kincaid said, local
funding would supplement the
budget. He said “everyone on
the town board wants the pro-
gram to continue and
strengthen.” He said “I wil
pledge to continue the pro-
gram,” but “I’m one vote of
five.” (See accompanying arti-
cle.)

Steve Hughes, community
liason for the Y-Student Service
corps, said “my greatest worry

is the fact that if Federal Reve-
nue Sharing is cut off, people
will point to the fact that the
community center is not used to
its potential, and that it’s going
to be abandoned. We need to
make sure the Federal Revenue
Sharing is not cut out and then
address the problem of using the
community center to its poten-
tial.” He said there is a big prob-
lem even if the Board of Com-
missioners revokes the vote.

Maczka said “We have to
save the community center. |
feel it is important to Davidson
students to have an opportunity
to serve others and to balance
out their education. It gives

them the extra [feeling] of
accomplishment outside of the
classroom.”

She added “If we lose it,
we’re limiting the education for
Davidson students. It’s impor-
tant for Davidson students to
work in that part of the commu-
nity.”

Maczka said “We need it as
much (if not more) than the chil-
dren and the old people do.”

Mayor Knox said in a Janu-
ary Mecklenburg Gazette article
“that the town had signed a
lease for the center for the next
ten or twelve months and that no
changes would be made during
that time.”

taxes) are providing more
money for the budget.

Hence, Kincaid said, “The
revenue sharing resolution that
the town passed is unrelated to
the community center.”

In reaction to the Board of
Commissioner’s resolution on
Federal Revenue Spending,
Beth Maczka began a petition
urging “the Town Council to
take an active role in assuring
the successful continuation of
this facility [the community

center] in the future.”

Committee Examines

Maczka said “I’m hoping to
get a lot of strong community
support. It’s important that the
community be aware of what’s
happening. We have to save the
community center.” She said
the main issue is “maintaining
these services.”

Anne Lambert, president of
the Y-Student Service Corps
said, “It is very disappointing to
discover that community lead-
ers have misrepresented the
town in such a gross fashion.
The five members of the Town
Council and the Mayor made

decision which purported to
represent the town but it was
done without the consult of the
citizens of Davidson or the Col-
lege community.”

She added “The loss of rev-
enue sharing would have a de-
trimental effect on community
service within Davidson. The
Y-SSC is committed to preserv-
ing the community center and
the programs it contains.”

There will be an open Town
Council meeting this Tuesday at
7 p.m., the place has yet to be
announced.
