Epes Jams on
Television's Jeopardy!

By Sean Lind :

Duringthe first two weeks
of July, Hansford Epes, Davidson
professor of German and Humani-
ties, appeared as a contestant on
NBC’s Jeopardy! game show.

Epes won his first tourna-
ment game decisively, $16,000 to
$0 and the second narrowly,
$23,001 to $23,000 (both in points,
or “funny”-money) to move-into
the semifinals. There he also fared
well, bringing home $11,100 in
winnings as wellas some nice part-
ing gifts.

~. Tobeon the show, Epes
answeyed a Jeopardy! ad in .the
Observer and became one of
twenty-three people selected dur-
ing the Charlotte tryouts in late
December of last year.

Epes was then invited to
appear as one of 15 contestants in
a special “‘Seniors Tournament.”
The Tournament, for contestants
over fifty years of age, was taped
in Hollywood February 24-25.
Unlike normal Jeopardy! contes-
tants, who must pay for their trip to

Hollywood as well as room and
board, Tournament contestants
were flown by Jeopardy! to Cali-
fornia and given lodging at the
Beverly Hills Hilton.

Epes was “reasonably
pleased” with his Jeopardy! ap-
pearance. The best part of the
experience, explained Epes, was
getting tomeet and talk with other
-eontestants -“‘a diverse and -inter-
esting group of folks from all over
the country.”

What was it like to be on
America’s #2 rated game show?
Although he was not worricd be-
fore the show, Epes admitted “the
nerves really hit when I heard the
announcer say, ‘now entering our
studios are...”

In answer to the question °

on everyone’s mind - what is Alex

Trebek really like?- Epes an--

swered: “‘He’s.a very calm, pleas-
ant man; very professional, He
knows his stuff.”

And the lesson to be
leamed from all of this? In the
words of Epes, ““Humes pays off.”

New Court Alcohol —
Policy Takes Effect -

By Kevin Miller

This year marks a new
era for Davidson’s Patterson Court
with the implementation of thenew
Alcohol Policy. Amid last year’s
controversial report on “Rebuild-
ing Community” the Board of
Trustees approved this new policy
in an effort to “uphold the laws of
North Carolina in regard to the
consumption of alcohol, namely

that only those twenty-one years

of age and older may consume
alcohol on the Davidson campus.”

SGA President Anthony
Foxx said, “I supported the policy
because I felt that students had
ample influence in its design.” He
went on to say that the college had
to create a new policy because
- under the old policy it was. ex-
tremely vulnerable to liability for

any unfortunate situations that
could arise at functions in which
alcohol is served.

He also said that it was
tough for him to support such an
unpopular policy, but that in the
shortand long term the change was
for the best. “It was inevitable that
the college would pass a policy
that the students wouldn’ t like,” he
said.

Foxx also predicts that
there are further adjustments to be

made in the new policy so as to.

accommodate students needs, but
that only time will tell what and

when these accommodations will.

come about.
Below are some high-
lights of the new policy:

Administration Suspends
Fraternity For '92-'93 School Year

By Tom Koonce & Tom Price

At the end of the 1992
Spring semester the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon fraternity was suspended
from participation on Patterson
Court by President John
Kuykendall and Dean Will Terry.’
This suspension began on August
1 and will last for the entire 1992-
93 school year. The earlicst date
that SAE can- petition for re-
instatement on Patterson Court is
the fall of 1993.

SAE received their sus-
pension after holding a pledge ac-
tivity on April 25 specifically for-
bidden by the Dean of Students.
Dean Terry explicitly told former

Davidson Welcomes the

SAE president Steve Lilly that if
such activities were held he would
have nochoice but to suspend SAE
from the Davidson campus.

Inaletter tothe parents of
SAE brothers sent out June 23,
Dean Terry stated, “...the event
occurred on April 25 without the
knowledge or agreement of many
members of the fraternity, includ-
ing the current [new] president and
vice president.”

Terry also said, “The
irony in all of this is that many of
the people who were responsible
will not bear the burden for the
defiant act of April25. I am sorry,
truly sorry, about that but given the
current climate on campus, a cli-

mate which SAE helped very much
tocreate throughout the year, there
is no choice.”

Despite SAE’s removal
from Patterson Court, the frater-
nity intends to maintain a unified

¢presence on campus. SAE presi-

dent David Lindsay said, “The at-
titude of the house has been over-
whelmingly positive and. unificd
towards making our ‘year abroad’
a success.”

In addition to weekly
mectings held in Eumenean Hall,
David Lindsay said that the frater-
nity willembark on two new major
service projects: cooperating with

Class of 1996 at Orientation

By Sally Stone
Freshmen Orientation

for the class of 1996 began on
Thursday August 22 as nervous

first-year-students’ lined up by
8:30am for the early-morning reg-
istration. From Union Boardmem-
bers to Dean Terry, Davidson Col-
lege was ready to greet the newest
mebers of its community.

Many Orientation tradi-
tions continued this year and were
combined with new ideas to help
the freshmen make an easy transi-
tion into the Davidson lifestyle.
Director of Residence Life Rich-
ard Terry believed that logistically,

this year’s Orientation ran excep-
tionally well. The Chapel
committee’s move-in services re-:
ceived unanimous praise from
Dean Will Terry, Richard Terry,
freshmen and thcir parents.

A new addition to the
schedule was a small group dis-
cussion of the novel Waiting for
the Barbarians, senttoevery fresh-
men this summer. Richard Terry
explained that the intention of hav-
ing freshmen read this book was
that it provided a way to make a
Statement to incoming students
about Davidson College as a com-
munity. While individual opin-

ions varied among the various
groups, Terry summarized the ef-
fort as wholly successful.

One ofthe problemscited
with orientation was the distribu-
tion of schedules followed by a
drop/add periiod all in the same
afternoon. Hallmates Ben
Schleafer and Will Robinson ex-
pressed concern and surprise at
not recciving their expected
classes. Schleafer felt “no fair
warning” was given that schedules
would probably have to be ad-
justed, especially so quickly after

Union Outpost to Open September 9

By May Martin

The house at Number
Three Patterson Court, known to
some as old Warner Hall or Old
Connor House, has a new iden-
tity— the Union Outpost. The
Dean of Students Office, the Union,
and Auxiliary Services are work-
ing together to create this experi-
mental facility, which will hold a
grand opening ceremony on
Wednesday September 9.

The idea for the vacant
house originated last year as the
need for more varied social op-
tions emerged. “The Patterson
Court scene doesn’t seem to suit
the needs of most students,” Dean
of Students Will Terry said, “The
Outpost will allow the Union and
other groups to program ina loca-
tion that is geographically in the
center of social life.”

The house will provide
food service Wednesdays and
Thursdays from 11 pm to 3 am,
and Fridays and Saturdays from 8
pm to 3 am. Terry hopes students
who have been drinking and are
looking for a late night meal will
opt for the Outpost instead of driv-
ing to Cornelius for late night

snacks,

The Union secs the house
as an extension of the Grey Union
building. In addition to providing
ahangout for all students the house
will be used for concerts, mect-
ings, and other events. A Union
employee will staff the Outpost,
which will house vending ma-
chines, a jukebox, a ping pong
table, video games, other games
like chessor Trivial Pursuit to check
out, and a TV. In addition to the
cafe hours, the house will be open
for informal student. recreation
Monday through Saturday from 9
to’ll pm. Groups may schedule
meetings at the Outpost Monday

through Thursday from 7 to 9 pm.
through Lynda Daniels (-2174).

Dircctorof Auxiliary Ser-
vices Carleton Pritchard plans on
opening the cafe 50 days this se-
mester. “I am enthusiastic about
this projet. The cafe is in a good
location for students in the senior
apartments, down the hill, or even
the dorms up the hill.”

Pizza, sandwiches, eggs
to order, and other snacks will be
offered in a mostly self-serve at-
mosphere. The cafe will accept
Catcards as soon as the system is
installed. The cafe will be run by
