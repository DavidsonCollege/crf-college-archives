It was not supposed to end at home like
it did.

This year’s four seniors—Landry
Kosmalski, Stephen Marshall, Jeff Bergmann,
and Davor Halbauer—deserved a win in their
last appearance in Belk Arena.

But the team’s Senior Day comeback
attempt, led by Kosmalski and Marshall, rep-
resents the determination and talent the Class
of 2000 has brought to the court.

“We’ ve been lucky ever since I’ ve been
at Davidson. We’ ve had senior players who
have been the heart and soul of the team,” said
head coach Bob McKillop.

“They’ ve carried the torch from the pre-
vious teams and taught the freshmen, sopho-
mores, and juniors great lessons. They’ve
maintained a strict adherence to our code of
caring, commitment, and trust.”

THE DAVIDSONIAN

These four players arrived at Davidson
on the heels of a remarkable 25-5 season,
including an undefeated conference record
and went on to post a 72.1 career winning
percentage in conference play over the next
four years.

After tying for first place in-the North
Division their freshman year, the Wildcats
won it outright during the 1997-98 season.
And the past two years Davidson has earned
second place in the division. In their sopho-
more year these seniors went 20-10 on the
way to the NCAA tournament after winning
the Southern Conference tournament.

“We’ve always played important roles
since we were freshmen,” said Marshall. “One
reason I came here, and I think Landry and
Davor and Jeff would agree, was that there
was an opportunity to play a lot. We've all
had the opportunity to play a lot and develop
our game a lot.”

Marshall and Kosmalski have led the _

Class of 2000’s last home game an exception to the rule

team in scoring in 20 of 26 games, including
the last ten straight, and in rebounding in 25
or 27 games. Their final season includes
impressive road wins over College of Charles-
ton and Appalachian State, and a memorable
upset of Wake Forest at home.

Marshall, Davidson’s 29th all-time lead-
ing scorer with 1,029 points. After struggling
through some injury-induced inconsistency
early in his career, including missing the first
twelve games of his freshman season,

Marshall has been on a tear this year. He_

leads the team in scoring with 15.8 points per
game, and remains among the nations’ lead-
ers in shooting percentage, connecting on 61
percent from the floor.

The 6-8 center from Midlothian, Va.,has .

eleven twenty-point, games this season and
has never shot below 50 percent from the
floor for a season. His five double-doubles
this season include a 20 point, 11-rebound
effort on Senior Day.

“My biggest problem in the past. has
been inconsistency,” Marshall said. “This
year one of my main goals was to be consis-
tent. I think I’ve gotten a lot better at that. I
think our senior class has been better as a
whole. I feel like we’re peaking now at the
right time.”

Kosmalski agreed. ““We’ ve got to make
sure we’re playing hard all the time. We’ve
got to practice hard all the time to play hard all
the time.”

Kosmalski has been a model of consis-
tency throughout his four-year career. The 6-
7 forward from Bedford, Texas, has scored
over 1400 points.and grabbed over 800 re-
bounds. In the history of Davidson basket-
ball, he ranks third in total rebounds and
eleventh in scoring. He has led the team in
rebounding in 18 games this season and has
22 double-doubles during his career.

As a junior, Kosmalski earned a spot on
the All Southern Conference second team,
after not missing a start. The only start he has
missed for the last four years was Senior Day
“96, his freshman season.

Kosmalski and Marshall have been po-
tent deep threats, too. Their inside game is
hard enough to defend, but these two big men
can step outside and hit the three, too. Marshall
shoots over 40 percent from behind.the arc.

Jeff Bergmann has played a strong role
in this year’s success and made five starts.
The 6-4 sharpshooter had a career high 19
points in a win over Chattanooga in mid-
February. Bergmann has contributed more
points this season than he had in the previous
three seasons combined.

“Off the court we’ve established a great
friendship these last four years,” Bergmann
said of his senior teammates. “The friendship
that we’ve had the last four years, that’s
something you can’t eclipse.”

Halbauer’s season, unfortunately, ended
prematurely when he tore his ACL at Charles-
ton after playing only eleven games. For
senior day, Halbauer, a native of Croatia,
dressed in uniform for the pre-game cer-
emony.

Halbauer has been one of the deadliest
three point shooters in Davidson history. He
ranks sixth all-time with 128 threes and has a
35.8 career three-point shooting percentage.

“We've spent a lot of time together.
We've had fun out there,”’ said Halbauer.

But this group’s leadership has gone
beyond statistics and wins. Not only have
they matured and improved as people and
players, but they also have helped the younger
players grow. They have ignored the pres-
sure this season and tried to enjoy playing.

“We still have a lot of expectations on us
since we are four seniors. There has been a lot

‘Of pressure on our class,” Marshall said. “I

think we all have tried to play with a looser
type of attitude and have fun out there.”

“They don’t allow anything to slip,”
McKillop said. “They’re consistent in the
way they work in practice. They’re consis-
tent in the way they handle themselves on and
off the court. And being that way. they’ve
been great role models. It’s hard to believe,
that being two or three years older than these
guys, yet they’re great role models for the
freshmen and sophomores.”
