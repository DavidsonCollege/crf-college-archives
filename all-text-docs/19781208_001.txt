The North Carolina: Legislative Building in : Raleigh is
quiet now. But battle lines have already been drawn for
a conflict that could disrupt the building's solitude.

When the general assembly convenes in January, a
war of words and statistics is expected to erupt. within
the legislature between private and state-supported
colleges and universities. Fallout from the war will
directly affect a quarter of Davidson’s students.

At issue is state aid to North Carolina undergraduate
students enrolled in private colleges and universities.
Presently, every N.C. student enrolled in ‘a private
school receives a grant from the state that- averages
$600. The presidents of the state’s 38 private schools
unanimously say their students need an increase of

$200 by 1980-81.

The Board of Governors of the University of North
Carolina—the group that oversees operation of all the
and universities—has_unani-
mously refused to endorse the private schools’

proposal.

Futhermore, the private school presidents have
unanimously requested that a permanent formula be
established for state aid to their students. And just as __
unanimously, the UNC board has refused to ‘endogse
any permanent formula.

The issue is complicated: Two seperate programs
actually administer the aid, and recommendations are
funneled down through a detailed, and sometimes
contradictory, procedure. But the end result to
Davidson is real.

North Carolina students who attend school here will
‘receive a quarter of a million dollars this year. If the

Faced with double-digit infla-
tion and rising Social Security
taxes, the administration will
be pressed in allocating College
income as it begins scrutinizing
departmental funding requests
for the 1979-80 budget.

The deadline passed ‘last
Monday but Comptrolller Ro-
bert W. Davidson said that
while requests have not yet
been received, all are expected
within the week.

During the next several
weeks,” a committee composed
of President Samuel R. Spen-
cer, Vice President for Acade-
mic Affairs T. C. Price Zimmer-
mann, Vice President for Deve-
lopment’ Duane Dittman, Da-
vidson, Business Manager Ro-
bert A. Currie, and Director of
the Physical Plant Grover
Meetze, will meet to consider

budget in line with projected
College income.

Ses

the requests and assemble a’

- Davidson: noted that a major
factor in the new budget will be
inflation.

» “On the whole, inflation-has

been running at almost 10
percent this year. There have
been several increased in the
cost of fuel oil in recent years
and, since OPEC is expected to
approve a 5 to 8 percent
increase in the cost of crude oil
this month, I believe it will go
up again.” -

Currie noted, “Besides utility
rates, the College will have to
allocate more for this year’s
scheduled tax increases. The
hourly minimum wage will be
increased and, more significant-
ly for us, Social Security taxes
are going up pretty sharply on
January 1. This presents a
problem since the-College must
match all social security taxes
taken from employee salaries.”’

Davidson pointed out, ‘‘We
have also been warned that
insurance rates will go up fairly
soon across the board. These

Balancing the budget

Administrators struggle with double-digit inflation

‘are only the most apparent

strains on the budget. The
growing cost of food and. ser-

-vices_does_not show signs of

letting up.”

When asked whether student -

activities taxes will be increased
next year, Currie stated, “The
Activities Tax Council hasn’t
met yet this year. The tax
revenues come to $50,000 pre-
sently and were increased $5 per
student last year, so any in-
crease would be only to cover
for inflation unless, of course,
we could somehow cut expendi-
tures.’

Associate Professor Alexan-
der McKelway, chairman of the
Davidson chapter of the Ameri-
can Association of University
Professors, voiced strong con-
cern over ‘‘the trend toward
decreased faculty salaries.”’

“The faculty’s main concern
is that a larger amount be
allocated toward the educatio-
nal branch. We don’t deny
needs in other areas but this we

believe is central to the College.

“Within this concern is that
for faculty salaries. The actual
decline in constant dollars has

been 8 percent at Davidson |

within the’ last decade, excee-
ding the overall national de-
cline. This reduction in actual
spending power is something we
all suffer from, but it puts the
faculty under considerable eco-
nomic strain as well.

“Considering the difficulty in :

getting in graduate programs
today, the fact that academic
positions are harder and harder
to get and keep, and the
increased numbers of students
to be taught, it is ironic that
salaries are going down.”
McKelway noted also that

'‘ faculty compensation as a per-

centage of the total educational
expenditures fell from 43.7 in
1966-67 to 34.9 in 1977-78.
“Furthermore, in the last four

years mean faculty salaries

have increased less than. any
