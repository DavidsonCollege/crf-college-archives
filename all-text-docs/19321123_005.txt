From the glimpses we got of Duke's |
Freshman team last Friday, we judge that
Wallace Wade is striving to have as heavy a
team at Duke in the future as he had at
Alabama several years ago.

“The lightest but the fightingest” is
what Coach Laird calls his 1932 Wild-
kittens. Those Freshmen showed plenty
of fighting spirit in. their final game

Fourteen men will don Davidson football uniforms for the last time, when the Wildcats meet Wake Forest on Richardson
Field Thanksgiving Day. Reading from left to right, back row, they_are: Gene Cannon, Captain Buddy Gardner, Jack Wagner,

general play throughout the season,
stamp her as one of the strongest teams
in the Big Five, despite her present po-
sition in the race. Neither Wake For-

game. The Deacons are the favorites,

To Take Big Five Title

Carolina-and_N.-C.State Tie for Sec-
ond Honors in Race

Duke University, by defeating Carolina for
the first time since 1893 at Chapel Hill last
Saturday, won the Big Five championship
with three victories and one defeat for a
percentage of .750. The state champions
won the title through victories over David-
son, Wake Forest, and Carolina, while los-
ing only to N. C. State.

Second place was tied for by Carolina and
N. C. State, who have two victories, one de-
feat and one tie apiece for a .667 percent-
age.» Neither Wake Forest nor” Davidson
has won from a Big Five opponent this sea-
son and as a result are tied for the cellar
berth.

Only one Big Five game, that between
Wake Forest and Davidson, remains to be

You will notice the dif-

and never gums a pipe.
