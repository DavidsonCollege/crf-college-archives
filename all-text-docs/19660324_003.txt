Horsehiders Still Lose To Pfeiffer 5-2

EVEN RECORD AT 2-2

Diamondmen Bomb U. Va.,
Meet Keydets Tomorrow

The Wildcat baseballers, face
a full slate of spring break
games with a 2-2 record after
playing a doubleheader with VMI
tomorrow. The ‘Cats chalked up
two wins over the University of
Virginia, but were treed twice
by tough Pfeiffer.

Davidson opened its season
with a 4-3 loss to Pfeiffer, March
16. In the return bout Pfeiffer
rolled the ‘Cats to the tune of
4-2. The nine from Misenheim-
er exploded in the second in-
ning to chalk up two runs on
the scoring charts. They scored
again in the third and ninth in-
nings to hand the ’Cats their
second loss.

Bryant Hinnant and Skip Waite
led the ‘Cat batters with two
RBIs.

The battered ‘Cats then tan-
gled with the Cavaliers from U.
Va., and registered twice in the
winner's column. Seven was
Davidson's lucky number as the
‘Cats ruled their guests 7-2 on
Monday and 7-1 the next after-
noon. Buddy Durham pitched for
the winners the first game, with
Henry Wilmer doing the honors
on Tuesday.

The ‘Cats committed only two
errors each game against the
Cavaliers, against four each tilt

against Pfeiffer.

Tomorrow will be the season
opener for the Keydets, who will
bring a young, inexperienced
team,

All Southern Conference bas-
ketballer Charlie Schmaus will
be back at third base, with
former All-Conference ace Dee
Hartman manning the right field
slot.

According to Coach Fred Kel-
ley, “Our success will depend
on the pitching. With only a five
man pitching staff and seven
doubleheaders there will be a
real strain.”

The Keydets will be missing
pitcher Ruben Terry and short-
stop Dennis White. Also missing
from the roster will be fire-
balling righthander Percy Sensa-
burg, who batted over .300 last
year but struck out with the
books.

Saturday the ‘Cats head south
for a six game tour. Davidson
opens with Georgia Southern
Saturday in Statesboro, Ga. The
"Cat nine then moves to Deland,
Fla., for a doubleheader with
Stetson.

The Hatters of Stetson boast
eleven returning lettermen,
which includes last year's en-

tire infield.

On March 30-31 the ‘Cats meet
Florida Southern, one of the
strongest teams in that state.
Leading the champions of the
Florida Intercollegiate Confer-
ence will be pitcher Bruce Ait-
ken (0.63 ERA), a Little All-
American hurler from Jackson-
ville.

DOWN AMHERST, SWARTHMORE

By YATES FAISON
Davidsonian Sports Writer

This year's edition of the

-|'Wildeat tennis team opened on

a sound note by downing Am-

herst, 5-4, and Swarthmore, 9-0.

The Amherst match went down
to the wire with Dick Hurd and
Geordie Mueller winning the de-
ciding match in their third set.
Another important contribution
came from Bill Council and
Peter Parrott, who twice fought
back from match point to post
an important victory in the aum
ber one doubles match.

Coach Harry Fogleman relat
ed, ‘‘We knew that Amherst had
a fine team, but this was the
first time we could play them
due to rainouts in the past years
They were much like us--good
depth but without the big na
tionally-ranked star.”

Coach Fogleman added that he
hoped to continue the fine re
lationship. between the two
schools, “but we also hope they
don’t make it so rough on us.”
He singled out Council and Hurd
as ‘Playing “their usual fine

Whittle commended the team,
saying that they all did an ex
ceptional job. He said that there

Woody Faulk was very im-
in his first varsity
match, and Parrott “played a

somewhat off his game due to
an injury and a slight cold.

The ‘Cats were unbeatable in
their shellacking of Swarthmore.
Swarthmore tennis coach Ed
Faulkner, who coached the
American Davis Cup team in
1964 and has helped present na
tional stars Ashe and Pasarell,
commented on Davidson tennis,

“IT was very much impressed
with Davidson's caliber of ten
