Cut System

We believe that our system of class cuts here at Davidson—
while for the most part satisfactory — could be altered in sever-
‘al respects which would make it of greater effectiveness and
value to every student and at the same time raise the average

grade level. »

The system now in effect leaves nothing to student ‘initia-
tive and does nothing to urge him toward the attainment of high-
er grad&s. It is well and good to speak of learning for its own
sake and to set ourselves to the task of developing intellectual in-
terests and personal motivation. The faet of the matter, how-
ever, is that tangible goals and rewards provide far more incen-
tive to the avernge person than do the less obvious principles of

intellectual aspiration.

Under the present arrangement not only does the student
feel that he has defrauded himself if he hasn’t used his last cut
by the semester’s end; but the best student at Davidson is re-
quired to attend as many classes and is under the same super-
vision as far as his academic work is concerned—as the poorest

student.

We feel that if the number of euts allowed a student was in
some manner sealed to his scholastic average, he would not only
strive for higher grades but in addition he would cut a class
only when necessary. With the realization that our freedom in
regard to attendance, or the lack of it, depended solely upon the
quality of our work, we would most likely see that our efforts
more nearly approached our potentialities.

It is true that such a system would entail a large amount
of administrative work axd expense. We believe, however, that
the increased responsibility placed on the stadent to produce
high quality work; and the knowledge that some recognition
and privilege was being accorded him in line with the extent
of his efforts, would more thdn compensate for the work and
expense involved in setting up such a system.

Ants

In last week’s issue of The Davidsonian an incident was re-
corded where an unfortunate intident occurred while a student
was in the process of trying to rid his dormitory room of ants.
Perhaps he chose the wrong method to accomplish his ends, but
the fact remains that we do have ants in our dormitories, and
that they are very definitely a nuisance.

Perhaps to some extent it is the fault of the students that
we are plagued with these insects, but I think not altogether.
Food left lying around the rooms is going to attract. ants, if
they are anywhere around. Here the students should be more
careful with their packages from home. We ought 2o put them
in a safe place and then not allow them to lie aronnd for sev-

eral weeks before being disposed of. We all enjoy receiving | -

packages from home, but we do not enjoy sharing them with

the ants.

However, it seems to me that the college could also take
steps to rid the dormitories of ants once and for all. This sum-
mer the ants had a regular supply line running from one end
of Duke dormitory to the other, and I’m confident that the
situation is similar in other dorms. I don’t know whether or
not the college has been approached on this matter, but it seems
that it is certainly worthwhile looking into.—RLT.

Letter To Judge Doug Rice

Mr. Doug Rice, Judge
Court of Control

Dear Sir:

This is the first letter I have ever
written at 9:02 p.m. I am writing
this because I cannot sleep.

We, the undersigned seniors,
agree in our own way with the
age-old custom that rank has its
privileges, that upper-classmen have
certain privileges as well as re-
sponsibilities. This letter concerns
the latter: In the past it has been
the duty and responsibilities of
upper.classmen to indoctrinate the
barbarian Freshmen with principles
of gentlemanly conduct, and,
further, to insure their strict, if un-
willing, conformance to these prin-
ciples,

We have just returned from a
profoundly moving picture show,
which was feduced to a ridiculous
farce by the clownist antics of sev-
eral members, one in particular, of
the freshman class. We feel that
they have irreparably damaged the
good name of our college with a
Public display of such despicable
character.

This freshman, obviously taking
full advantage. of his unlighted
corner, aware of the audience, yet

nN .

mm utter disregard of its reasona.
ble desire to watch the show, did
willfully, unlawfully, and spitefully
commit the following:

(1) Bellowing like a blood-
hound, drawing scattered
laughs from his freshman ac-
complices;

(2) “Oinking” like a pig,
drawing less applause;

(3) Yelling “Fifi” at an inno-
cent, virtuous, young ballet
dancer. By this time even his
freshman compatriots had be-
gun to ignore him;

(4) Making obscene noises
during an especially tender
love scene, bringing only stifled
chokes from ‘three tadies sit-
ting behind him.

Sir, we had considered making a
contribution to the Freshman Wel-
fare Fund, but now we're extreme-
ly doubtful whether we will or not.

Sincerely,

GILBERT HUMPHREYS.

During the time that 1 have
been associated with the Scripts
‘n Pranks as an active writer, sev-
eral faults have been consistently
in’ evidence
These faults are,
in esstnce, the
same ones which

yp Dr. Abernathy

. as directed at ex-
mm" tra curricular

§ activities in gen-

eral in his now
historic chapel
speech and the

uo sano atues
which he later expanded at a meet-
ing which was open to all interested
parties from the organizations he
had criticized earlier.

t. During the three years in
which I have been associated with
the magazine there has been no
consistent editorial policy either.
within anyone year or from year
to year. The magazine’s' avowed
purpose is to publish, in the main,
the works of those students whose
writing is characterized by a
serious approach to literary com-
position, By serious I do not mean
that the works published ‘must of
necessity be duff, heavy, unin.
teresting works, but that they must
be of superior quality. Editorship,
as exemplified in the magazine,
has repeatedly broken down at this
point and much has been published
which “is inferior to that (pub-
lished) in first-class high schools.”
To edit is “to revise and prepare
for publication” or “to direct the
editorial policies of.’ It is quite
apparent that many works have
been published whose right to be
included. in the magazine has been
subjected to neither the one nor
the other definition of “edit” as

THE DAVIDSONIAN —

The DAVIDSONIAN Presents

By HENRY E. HANSEN

it appears above. To return to my
earlier point concerning consistent
editorial policy, the editors of the
magazine in the past three years
have been trying to straddle ‘a
fence, in that they have played
both down to and up to certain
opposing groups within the stu-
dent body, ie, they have tried to
please two groups; one of which
desires a magazine with the main
emphasis on humor, not quality;
the other of which desires, above
everything else, quality. The results
have not been too pleasant. This
raises the question as to whether
the present purpose of the maga-
zine is the right purpose. But it
is just here that the editorial func-
tion must assert itself. Either the
magazine is to be dedicated to
serious works as defined before,
or it is to be the amusing, frivolous
and ordinary» publication that it
is clewhere. Of course, it cannot
be entirely the one or the other,
but it must, generally speaking, stick
to one emphasis—either serious or
non-serious, And once having de-
cided on an editorial policy, this
policy must be carried out on a
long term basis of two, three, or
even more years. For the
magazine cannot approach any-
thing even remotely resembling per.
fection in the four issues of gne-
year whatever its purpose may be.
There must be a ltong-time, con-
sistent application of whatever edi-
torial policy is decided upon: To
sum up, the editorship of the
magazine must assert itself in for.
mulating and in sticking to a con-
sistent policy. Secondly, within this
policy, whatever it be, it must re-
fuse to publish anything not con-
‘sistent with this policy.

2. My second great criticism of

the magazine also stems front one

| of Dr. Abernathy’s more general
ones. Leadership in the magazine
is concentrated in the hands of too
few people, To my own knowledge,
there are several students whose
works should be included in the
magazine because they are of artis-
tic merit. People whose works are
characterized by this quality do
not always assert themselves and,
for this reason, the editor and all
others connected with the maga-
zine should be on search constant-
ly for new authors and new ma-
terial, This would be a relatively
simple thing to accomplish since
any one of our English professors
would be very happy to point out
students whose creative works they
consider outstanding,

Many other criticisms of a
derogatory nature might he made.
For one thing, the editor should
be chosen on the basis of merit
alone and merit in the field in
which his duties will lie—editor-
ship. For another, the magazine,
in order to really perform its func-
tion, should appear oftener than
four times a year. Though these
are important, 1 feel that the first
two mentioned are the most serious
criticisms of the magazine as it
has ‘been, Fhese do not apply to
the present magazine. Only one
issue of this year’s Scripts ‘n
Pranks has appeared and no ‘criti.
cism, pro or con, can justly be
made of it. But the criticisms of-
fered ure important, and unless

something is done to correct these
faults, then the exaltation of medi-
ocrity will continue to be reflected
in the Scripts 'n Pranks as it is
reflected elsewhere in the extra-
curricular activities of Davidson.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor:

Your article in a recent issue
pertaining to the Truman concert
has come to my attention by way
of the ‘mother of two Davidson

the daughter of our President.

“Pitiable and sad’’ are indeed
the words with which to describe the
attitude of. Mr. Hansen. He has
a perfect right to voice his opinions,

men. This lady was so upset to] jut such an ungentlemanly and

think that such an article should

malicious set of words has no

have been allowed in your paper] piace in our society.

that she sought comfort in her
musery and brought the paper to
me: hence, I have read a “Review
of Truman Concert,” which should
have been more properly entitled
“A Study in the Art of Pernicious
Slander.”

The author, one Henry E. Han-
sen, has dared to designate for
himself the task of setting Miss
Truman up for public scorn.

May I enumerate but a few of
the blunders he has committed in
the name of the student body of
Davidson College:

(1) He has insulted a guest
whom the college invited to its
. campus. This is not the South-
ern way of life, the Davidson
practice, or the policy of the
Presbyterian Church, U. S. The
situation is particularly alarm-
ing in the view of the fact that
Davidson is now in the m‘dst
of a campaign to raise funds
for improvements.

(2) He has ignored the rules
of professional courtesy and
has been cruel and rude to a
concert singer. The most em.
bittered New York critic, so to

speak, would not have hurled

such a scathing attack at any

performer. On what ability as a

_ critic does this Mr. Hansen

base his opinions and by what

prerogative does he dare to as-
sume the role of an experienced
and authoritative judge of the
failures and weaknesses of any
singer before the public today?

(3) He has cast aspersions
upon loyal Democrats, who
support Davidson with their
money, by the way; he has,
moreover, heaped injury upon
the “balavendered old ladies”
who came as guests to hear
Miss. Truman.

(4) He has injured the dig-
nity of the President of the
United States and openly
ridiculed the First Family of
our Land py words which cut
like knives of hot steel. This
fact alone is reason enough for
concern to anyone, regardless,
of political ties.

(5) He has, no doubt by this
time, caused anxiety and sor-
row in the heart of a charm.
ing and innocent young lady,

As a member of the Presbyterian
Church, U. S., 1 request, on behalf
of the Church and the College, an
immediace retraction of the slander-
ous statements made in the paper
concerning the ‘Truman concert,
and an apology by the “author” to
Miss Margaret Truman and the
members of our Church that are
so hurt by the article. I feel sure
that President Cunningham will
want to announce publicly that the
veiws of the critic are not those
of Davidson College.

Upon the insistence of fellow
churchmen and neighbors, I feel
constrained to caution The David-
sonian, that in the future, it should
be more careful and thoughtful be-
fore printing any more violent out-
bursts like the one in question,

Let me remind all. of you; this
| tirade has stirred up many, many
people and has done damage to all
—damage that will take some time
to heal.

Pleading for restraint, a wiser
selection of material for the paper,
and a more typically Christian Pres-
byterian spirit in all that you do
believe me to be

Most cordially yours,
W B, WHITE, JR.

(Ed’s Note: The Davidsonan
appreciates the interest ex-
pressed by Mr. White in Mr.
Hansen’s recent article. The
fact that Mr. Hansen's column.
was signed precludes any
Opinions expressed therein
being taken as a policy of The
Davidsonian or as a view of
of the college. However, the
Davidsonian does stand on a
policy of free expression of
opinion, regardless of which
political , party’s representative
chances to be occupying the
White House, and regardless
of the present financial condi.
tion of the school.)

Dear Editor:

If criticism is a healthy thing,
then I am getting a little replused
at the buxom, yea Hefer-like pro-
portions of our Davidson College
animal. While justifiable criticism
is not only in order, but mandatory,
this chronic wail about Davidson’s
homogeneity, its determined sup-
port of the Christian religion, via
Bible, chapel, and vespers, and its
regulated morality is growing into

something more than tiresome. To
vituperate the college simply be.
cause East-Side Jews don’t flock
in is the height of the ridiculous;
the doors are as open for them as
fur any boy from Mecklenburg
County, if they want to come. Fur-
thermore, I fail to see all the bless-
ed advantages to be derived from
filling the place full of an assort-
ment of heterogenous sympathies
and background. While at Indiana.
University this last summer, [I liv.
ed on a hall on which all races
were represented and five languag-
es regularly spoken. There I heard
nothing more startling or upsetting
than I had already heard said bet-
ter and more convincingly by my
own fraternity brothers here at
Davidson! When I am to be upset;
I want it to be done by fellow stu-
dents and professors with whom I
am congenial and from whom I can
expect a certain amount of sympa-
thy and understanding. Why try to
destroy this? Why seek to wear a
hair shirt, the only result of which
can be an irritatingly raw chest and
a horn-rimmed, no-other-hope-but-
suicide, intellectual expression.
Secondly, these Perpetual com-
plaints about religion and morality
at Davidson’ are about as illogical

‘Jand childish as the complaints of a

man, riding on a train going west,
which he knew was going west and
from which he could get off at any
time, who, nevertheless, every foot
of the way bitterly complained about
going West! Davidson College is
going the way of Christian educa-
tion; if one wants to go that way,
come to Davidson, and if these em-
bittered critics don’t want to go
that way, why don't they go some
other way, The catalogue very care-
fully states the religious and moral
requirements of this college, if one
does not approve of them, why sub-
scribe to them by his presence here?
Surely, we who believe in the im-
portance of religion and morality in
a college have just as much right
to maintain our views and practices
as the freethinkers have to main-
tain such a place as Black Mountain
College. ust Davidson College
conform Ao the present nationwide
trend téward materialistic educa-
tion with do-as-you-please morality?
Simply because everybody else is

falling into tho spirit of the age]:

is no reason for Davidson to. The
nation is full of colleges advocating
every other idea and spirit under
the sun; why not encourage David-
son to remain a bulwark and haven
for those people who still cling to
firm beliefs, unpopular as they may
be today in calvinistic Christianity
and free enterprise democracy.
Yours very truly,
/ William O. Harris.

_,. but the student is given little responsibility for his education

(The following is an excerpt
. from the opening address deliver-
ed to the National Student As-
sociation by President Harold
Taylor of Sarah Lawrence Col-

lege.)

In the past ten years, the Ameri-
can college student has shown that
he is a responsible person. He has
handled his own affairs. He has
chosen a career. He has worked: his
way through college. As a student,
he has edited newspapers, run busi-
nesses, fought a war, chosen a wife,
married her, supported a family, vot-
ed for a president. But during these
years, while young men and wo-
men in college have been doing
all of the things which adults do,
they have been treated, for the most
part, as intellectual children.

The student has been given very
little responsibility for his own edu.
cation. It has been organized for
him: by trustees, Boards of Re-
gents, faculty committees, alumni
committees, legislatures, businéss-
men, newspaper publishers, college
presidents, parents, and .educators.
Almost everyone in America, in-
cluding the Communist party and
the American Legion, now wants to
help in organizing college educa-
tion, Everyone seems to feel that
it needs more organization and su.
pervision, so that the student, who
is: conceived as an innocent late-
adolescent, will not be harmed by
the excitement of thinking and act-
ing for himself.

A whole host of the uninformed
have accordingly risen to form
themselves as an over-all American
Committee dedicated to protecting
American college students from
themselves, and to preventing live-
ly growth in their political and so.
cial maturity. It has become a na-

tional conviction that ability to funt-
tion as an executive in any branch
of business, industry, banking,
newspaper, or political life equips
a person to reform education. All

those who have thus ‘interested

themselves in the sanctity of the
American college have lined up to-
gether with one great handicap jn
carrying out their enterprise. They
are, for the most part, unaware of
the interests, talents, capacities,
and maturity of the present Amer.
ican student. This lack of aware
ness is, in some degree, shared by
educators and faculty members who
are responsible for the formal or-
ganization of the college program,

It is because of the lack of close
relation between all the planners,
academic and non-academic, and the
acting, thinking, learning student
in each college, that the student
has not been given the responsi-
bility he is ready to take. He is pre-
sented with education already sys.
tematically organized into credits,
units, grades, majors, courses, cur-
ricula, lectures, tests, mimeograph-
ed sheets, grade-point averages,
and other educational preventatives.
The American student is accord-
ingly over-organized. Under the
present system of mass education it
seems possible that he may disap-
pear into the organization, and be-
come lost as an individual.

The story of student life in Amer-
ica is one of gradual emancipation
from the intellectual and social con-
trols of the educational system, and
from economic circumstances which
have prevented the wider spread
of higher education for all. From
an informal look. at the history of
Students in America, I would say
that on most social questions and
on, most cducational quesiions, the
students have ‘been ahead of the
educators in suggesting liberal re-
forms which eventually have been
proved wise in adoption, It was dive
to the pressure of student inter-
est and need that the elective sys
tem came into effect. It was due
to the interest and activity of stu-
dents themselves that student goy
ernment and organizations have be
come such an important part of
university life.

College Rags In Brief

By TOM HOLLER

tion: Is it true that man comes from
the monkey?

As I see it the fallacy that the so
called “civilized human being”
comes from the monkey is a dis-
grace to the ape family. Our little
acrobatic friend shows much more
judgment than man. Monkeys do
not repeatedly drink a fluid they
know will cause them to lose their
senses and make them sick. They
do not pair off in large groups and
secretly create instruments to de.
stroy each other. They do not shout
about outlawing these instruments
while building even more deadly
weapons. They do not scheme, con-
nive or lie t0 make money or gain
power, even at the expense of their
best friend or closest relatives. It
is difficult to understand how the

ape family bears the abuse heaped
wpon it by being associated with
man, In reality it is a compliment
to tell a human being that he is
“making a monkey of himself.”
