Bill Bivins, Bob Nimocks, Al Gaither, Jimmy Miller, Tyler Berry,
Phil Blatt Make All-Fraternity Basketball Selection A Sextette

By WALLACE ABBOTT
This year's All-Fraternity Basketball first team is as rep-

resentatives as anv could possibl

y be; the team is comprised of

players from five different fraternities on the campus. The vast
number of fraternities represented on the All-Fraternity Basket-
ball team, as a whole, shows the enthusiasm and interest that

has been garnered on this campus
by the intramural program. There
is no dominance of players from
one fraternity on' the first team
or all the teams combined, but
rather there is a mixture of all the
groups.

The captain of this year’s team,
selected on the basis of the most
votes, is Bill Bivins. Bill received
a total of nine first team votes out

of a possible ten, therefore he lack-
ed only the support of one team
‘to have made him unanimous. The
other members of the first team in
order of votes polled were Bob
Nimocks, Al Gaither, Jimmy Mil-
ler, Phil Blatt and Tyler Berry. As
will be. noted there is a slight dis-
crepancy i? the fact that there are
six players mentioned here and
not the customary top five. The
cause of this unusual situation is
the fact that two of the boys,
Tyler Berry and Phil Blatt, polled
exactly the same number of votes.
Both of them were quite deserving
as can be evidenced by their play
this season, so no reason was seen
for discriminating between them.
The voting this year was con.
ducted through each fraternity's
sports managers. Each of the man-
agers was asked to select ‘three
teams from the members of the
opposing teams that they faced. If
a player was selected for the first
team he received three points; two
for being put on the second team
and one for the third team. In
other words ench fraternity select
ed an all. opponent team and tins
was combined to give the composite
All-Fraternity team.

Bill Bivins, Phi Delt

As could be seen by the large
number of votes which he received,
Bill Bivins- was the outstanding
player in the fraternity loop this
year. Bill gained his importance
not only because of his excellent
shooting, but also because of his
tricky ball handling and play.mak-
ing. His fine playing helped lead
Bill’s team to a top place in the
league.

Bob Nimocks, Beta

Bob made an unusual switch this
year when he transferred from the
varsity ranks to the intramural
floor, but he certainly proved that
he was capable of playing either
type of ball. Although Bob's team
was not too successful this year,
nevertheless he proved his worth
and on the basis of his point mak-
ing and rebound work he was se-
lected for the top team. Bob. was a
junior this year, so he still has an.
other year to make it rough on
his opponents.

Al Gaither, Pika

Al Gaither came forward again
this year, after a fine season last
year, to prove that he is one of
the top, players in the fraternity
league. Al's short hook and push
shots were a constant menace to
the Pikas opponents and also aid-
ed Al in piling up a large number
of points for the season, Al is an-
other Sophomore who has two
more years of eligibility remaining,
so he should make it hard on alt
other teams for the next couple

of years.

of the fact that a short man -
still play basketball; for’ although
Jim is very short he still managed
to play such jam-up games that
he couldn't be neglected in select-
ing the first team. Jimmy led: his
team throughont the year and was
seldom ou’ of the double figures in
the scoring column. This was Jim-
my's last year of ball, but he will
always be remembered as a little
man with a lot of hustle.

Tyler Berry, Sigma Chi

Tyler was one of the leading
players in the league last year, and
once again showed his ability by
being selected again. Tyler was one
of the top rebound and push shot
artists on the Sigma Chi team, a
team that went undefeated in the
standings for the year. Tyler is
another one of those sophomores
who will be back for two more
years to deal the other fraterni-
ties a lot of misery.

Phil Blatt, Sigma Chi

Tyler's and is quite naturally a
teammate, so it is sort of “poetic
justice” that they should end up
ued for a position on the All-Fra.
ternity Basketball team. Phil
gained his special recognition this
year for being a leading play mak-
er and rebound man for his team.

Hadacol May Relieve Cause of Troubles
When Due to a Lack of Vitamins B,,
Bz, Niacin and Iron, that Interfere with
Fun and Studies!

The marvelous benefits of HADA-
COL, today’s great nutritional
formula, are equally helpful to
young and old alike who are suffer-
ing from a lack of Vitamins B., B,
Iron and Niacin.

Here’s what these two -pretty
coeds, who may have been suffer-
ing from such deficiencies, have to
say: “We are two college students
writing you this letter. Before tak-
ing HADACOL we were nervous,
restless and unable to sleep at
night. We found we were foggy
all day and ached all over. Now
after taking only 3 bottles of HAD-
ACOL we are different persons.
We are full of life and energy and
our aches have completely disap-
peared. Thank you for your won-
derful discovery of that re ar’ able
product, HADACOL.”

Senator LeBlanc has been in
public life since he was quite
a young man and has always
advocated the cause of the op-
pressed and downtrodden. It
was he who introduced the law
in Louisiana that gives every
deserving man and woman in
Louisiana a pension of $50.00.
It was he who introduced the
law creating the office of Service
Commissioner, the duties of
which office is to see that every
deserving ex-soldier and veter-
an receives his just reward from
the Federal and State Govern-
ment. It was he who has con-
sistently fought the battle of
the school teachers in the halls
of the legislature. He worked
untiringly for the farmers and

This is typical of thousands of
letters telling how HADACOL re-
lieves the real and basic cause of
deficiency distresses. For HADA-
COL provides more than the mini-
mum daily requirement of Vita-
mins B,, Bz, Niacin and Iron, plus
- helpful quantities of Phosphorus
and Calcium, It builds up the
hemoglobin content of the blood
(when Iron is needed) to send
these precious Vitamins and Min-
erals surging to every part of the

body and to every body organ.

Why not find out today why
thousands say, “Only HADACOL
gives you that Wonderful Hadacol
Feeling.” At your druggist: ‘Crial

You can place your confidence
in a man who has by his past
activities demonstrated to you
that he is your friend. If you
are suffering from deficiencies’
of Vitamins B,, B:, Niacin and
Iron, don’t hesitate, don’t delay,
