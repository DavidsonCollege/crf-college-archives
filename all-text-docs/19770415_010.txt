= melodies of the East come South

By TONIA DEVON

Satiated with a délicately
spiced meal, you lean back in
your chair, shut your eyes,
and listen to whispers, laugh-
ter and quarrels which sur-
round you.

An average Saturday night
at the 900 Room? Not this
time. The interplay of emo-
tions, the tet-a-tet, is not that
of the other students there but
one created by two Indian
instruments, the sitar and the
tabla. Both create vocal ef-
fects conveying varied emo-
tions.

Saturday night Krishna
Bhatt and Peter Perringer will
give a concert of South Asian
music. Sri Bhatt, a celebrated,
young musician who has given
concerts in Japan, Europe, the
United States and South Asia,
will play the sitar.

The sitar, and the musical
tradition which houses it, are
difficult to master, if, indeed,
anyone can be said to master

something which is termed the
“Music of Discovery’’. It is a
tradition where the basic
structure, the raga, is born
anew each time it is played. As
one musician has put it ‘‘each
raga, in the hands of the truly
gifted performer, sits calmly
like a flower on its stem. Its
meaning is not a mere polish of
veneer.
something essentially unfin-
ished, a fugitive, flashing
thing. Because it lives, it
refuses to be held. Each time
you hear a raga, it is the
helpless, vulnerable opening of
a soul to reality’s infinite
wonder...the validity of a
great musician thus is proof as
much to a skill with life as it is
in singing or playing.”

Ten years would be a mod-
est requirement for attainment
of modest skill in a student of
the sitar. Most South Indians,
Mr. Bhatt included, are born
into musical families and be-
gin studying early in their
childhood.

It is the shine of

SITARIST KRISHNA BHATT will give two concerts
Saturday night at 8 and 9:30 pm in the 900 Room.

The sitar, together with the
tabla, makes ‘‘leela’”’ (which is
to the South Asian a ‘‘divine
play”’ or ‘‘jest’’). The tabla,
played by Peter Perringer, is a
set of two drums. It is the
most popular percussion in-
strument of the northern part
of South Asia. The tabla,
tapped with the right hand is

made of wood and the one at
the left hand is of metal.

For the devotee of Indian
music the unfolding beauty of
the music emerges from the
search for knowledge of the
mysterious, divine side of the
world, but the bonus of plea-
sure which emerges from this

If you can manage to forget

Northrop Frye and not invite
Gil Holland as your dinner
compsnion you just might
enjoy ‘‘Tom Jones’, the pro-
duction at the Pineville Dinner
Theatre. I did, which is pretty
convincing considering that
I’m an off and on aesthete and
occasional literary critic.

First, dinner theatre is not
theatre in your basic English
major definition of the word.
Entertainment — yes. Theatre
a la Chekhov et. al.—no. If
you go with the right expecta-
tions you won't be disappoin-
ted as with most things in life.

The physical set-up of the
theatre is nice, with seating on

three levels. If you want to
make sure to have a table to
yourself, reserve well in ad-
vance or you may be sharing
your dinner conversation with
another group of people.

The food, a major portion of
the evening, was surprisingly
good. Lots of fresh salad
makings, crunchy appetizers,
chicken, and roast beef as you
like it. The only thing that
gets bad marks are the soggy
vegetables that suffer from
stewing in their own juices too
long. Iced tea or coffee comes
with dinner and wine and
set-ups are also available.

“The play, “Tom Jones’,
leaves me with mixed feelings.
Most of the problem is with

the writing, not the produc-
tion. Although the narrator of
the play begins by explaining
that it is a loose adaptation of
“Tom Jones”’, I still expected
the spirit and style of Fiel-
ding’s novel, but was disap-
pointed on that expectation.

Instead of the gentle baw-
diness and wit of the novel,
this adaptation thrived on
slapstick humor and overt
sexuality. The infamous food
scene between Tom and his
supposed Mother Jenny at the
inn is a good example—in-
stead of slowly building up the
desire as in the novel, the
couple resorts to blending
smoothies on each other.

Tom is not the sympathetic,
good-hearted, amoral fellow he
was a few hundred years ago.
Frankly I didn’t give a damn
about his succeeding and win-
ning his true love Sophia
because he was simply a
selfish liar, not a misdirected
hero.

Sophia’s sweet patient inno-
cence is not allowed to be
developed either because the
playwright dwells on the baw-
dy scenes at the expense of the
areas that would add depth
and interest to the characters.

Fielding utilizes the narra-

® tor to broaden to do this, but

in the play the narrator has a
sex change and is used primar-
ily as an adornment and scene
setter.. Her dialogue lacks the
wry wit and sharp observa-
tion, leaving the characters
two-dimensional.

The music tells the story,
such as it is, but is instantly
forgetable.

Most of the players are good
and some are excellent. Al-
though all but one of the
females seemed to have been
picked more for the size of
their breast than their ability.
One was ‘‘Miss Indiana’’
twice.

The characters of Blifil,
Thwackum and Square are
uniformly excellent. Square,
who has a molish face and
Chuck Kennon coiffure and
Thwackum, short and corpu-
lent, provide a major portion
of the evening’s fun.

it was-a pleasant evening all
in all—it probably had more
worth than a month of ‘‘Char-
lie’s Angels” even if it was not

ain’t London or New York—be
thankful for whatcha got.

search will be there for anyone
in the Saturday audience to
enjoy.

Those attuned not only to

Indian music but also to

culinary delights of South
Asia, reserve seats for the 7
pm dinner before the concert
are available at the Union
desk.

Sidney Poitier gained his
fame as an actor largely
through performances of pro-
fundity and dignity, such as A
Raisin in the Sun, Lilies of the
Field, A Patch of Blue, and To
Sir With Love. In all these
films, with the exception of
Raisin, Poitier played a kind
of Black Ambassador to an
Ignorant White World. Holly-
wood filmmakers evidently
felt that the white filmgoers
who paid their bills would
consider Poitier ‘‘safe’’. Pro-
bably with a great deal of
pleasure, Poitier turned to
Uptown Saturday Night, a
comedy featuring him both as
star and director, which is this
week’s Pop Film attraction.
Uptown is decidedly not
profound, as its cast alone
would indicate. Poitier plays a
man named Steve Jackson
who, together with his cabbie
friend Wardell Franklin (Bill
Cosby) goes out for a night on
the town. And in a stick-up he

— loses his wallet containing his

wife’s very valuable lottery
ticket.

Steve and Wardell decide
they must try to recover the
wallet, and enlist the aid of a
private eye named Sharp Eye
Washington (played by Rich-
ard Pryor, a great success in
the recent Silver Streak). Am-
ong the characters they run
into are a gang leader played
by Harry Belafonte (that’s
right— Harry Belafonte), a
crooked politician played by
Roscoe Lee Brown, and a
revival preacher played by
Flip Wilson.

In short, it’s a long way
from building a chapel for
nuns, or teaching the facts of
life to cocky schoolkids.
