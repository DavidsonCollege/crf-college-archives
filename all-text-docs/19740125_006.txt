The Domino Theory

The present situation here at
Davidson regarding placement of
housing, Union and Library
facilities for next year is not unlike a
game of dominos. Because the
college is getting only one new
building next year and yet it is plan-
ning up to four major facility
relocations, it’s best to realize now
that problems with one facility will
undoubtedly create other problems
and delays all down the line—the
domino effect.

As of the fall of 1973, work on the
E.H. Little Library had gone unex-
pectedly well. Good weather
prevailed and construction was
ahead of schedule. Unfortunately,
many felt that this pace would con-
tinue and planned for occupancy of
the building on that assumption. It
was hoped that the structure could
be completed by the Spring of 1974,
leaving the entire summer to
renovate the Grey Library for use as
the Student Union in the fall.

Now, however, it seems that con-
struction problems and bad weather
have pushed the building 50 days
behind schedule. And of course this
means that work on the Grey
Library might not begin until
August. Director of Physical Plant
Grover Meetze has said that the
renovation work will take six months
and Davidson College could
possibly be without a new Union un-
til early 1975.

This is unfortunate, but more im-
portant, it points to another sticky
problem, the housing shortage as it
relates to coeducation.

When the trustees approved the
principle of coeducation, the EPC
was given the task of devising a plan
to implement it. The scheme finally
agreed upon was one that would
bring the coed enrollment to 500 by
1981, leaving the male enrollment at
1000. In its report, the EPC called for
a gradual increase in the number of
women students over a period of
nine years.

Speaking specifically of the fall of
1974, it called for the admission of up
to 75 freshwomen, plus up to 35 ad-
ditional upperclasswomen transfer
students. In short, assuming that the
numbers of graduating seniors in the
spring of 1974 and incoming fresh-
men that fall are roughly equal,
Davidson could expect its total
enrollment to increase by as much
as 110 in the fall of 1974.

But the obvious question is,
‘‘where are we going to house
them?’’ Davidson has no additional
housing facilities planned for
readiness by the fall, so work has
already begun to decide where in the

present facilities these additional
students can live.

One suggestion has been Jackson
Court; another is the basement of
Belk Dormitory, though possibly
both will be needed. It has been
suggested that the college bookstore
and the ROTC department might be
relocated so that this freed space in
the Belk basement can _ be
remodeled for student living quar-
ters. However, the bookstore was
earmarked for the Grey Union
which won’t be ready. And where
would ROTC go?

Another angle of the problem
focuses on the present Union
building, the former Guest House.
Some have said that the ROTC

_ department should be given that

building if they are to be evicted
from Belk. But again, how can
move into the Guest House building
if the Union is still there, being
unable to move into the Grey
Library because the Little Library
was so late in completion.

Clearly then, there is the need for
positive suggestions and decisions.
We feel that plans regarding these
problems should be formulated im-
mediately and endorse the following
principles that the decisions should
observe:

1)Under no circumstances should
the Student Union be deprived of its
present facilities in the Guest House
until renovations of the Grey
Library have been completed. 2)
That the college should not resort to
placing more than two students to a
room in an effort to provide housing
for all. 3) That if space is available
in the basement of the new Little
Library, then it in some way be
utilized. that

Specifically, we feel that space
can be found in the basement of Lit-
tle Library to accomodate the
bookstore in the fall of 1974 (and
possibly ROTC as well) and that the
college persue this option before any
other.

The basement of the Little Library
is large enough to accomodate the
bookstore and the ROTC people.
Once the Grey Union is completed,
the bookstore could go in there and
ROTC could go to the Guest House.
(Other possibilities for the bookstore
are Chambers basement and
Richardson Dorm basement).

It’s an interesting game of
dominos, one that at best, with
prompt and careful planning, might
result in adequate temporary
placement of all facilities and at
worst, could mean three students to
a room in one of the present dorms,
or a Union scattered across the cam-
pus if the bookstore and ROTC were
forced to occupy the Guest House six
months before the completion of the
Grey Union.

Leadership Called For

To Meet Governance
Problems On Campus

ED NOTE: Bo Phillips, past
president of the SGA and an
active member of the National
Student Association, gives his
insights into the role of the
Student Government
Association at Davidson and
governance on campuses
across the country in the "70's.

This annual column has
usually offered .the out-going
SGA president an opportunity
to review his term in office,
but at the risk of breaking a
hallowed tradition, I wish to
focus on the future rather than
the past.

Student government at

Davidson is in the process of
rapid change, and the
challenges of the next few
years will be numerous. I offer
these thoughts as one who has
been concerned with the
national student movement as
well as student government on
this campus.
” The marches of the '60s and
the activism characteristic of
recent years have now disap-
peared on campuses as
students concern themselves
more with securing a respec.
table job. In the process,
student governments have
found themselves without the
glamorous issues which at-
tracted so many capable
workers in the late sixties.

In 1974, most student gover-
nments across the country
are composed of a small group
of activitists who rarely
represent the majority of their
constituency; legitimacy and
viability are problems facing
most SGAs in the country, par-
ticularly at the large univer-
Sities.

Student governments must
redirect their main sources of
power towards dealing with
issues which affect their
academic community, respon-
ding more to the needs of their
fellow students.

The first step towards this
new direction must be a
change in the campus gover-
nance. At Davidson, we have
made encouraging progress in
this area, and the new cam-
pus constitution should be
reported out of committee in
late spring.

Structural changes serve to
increase official student input
and facilitate policy changes
in educational policy and
student conduct regulations.
Furthermore, the opportunity
for different campus con-
stituencies to settle their
quarrels in a_ constructive
fashion is offered in well-
integrated policy making
groups.

The other major step which
should be made as _ student
governments deal more ac-
tively with campus issues con-
cerns reorganizations of
student government.

We can no longer afford to
have the SGA Senate serve
primarily as a group which
meets once a week to hear
reports of what a few
dedicated senators have tried
to accomplish.

At Davidson, there needs to
be an increase in cooperation
among campus organizations,
perhaps through a council

composed of the SGA officers,
representatives from the
Union and Social Council, etc.

I would recommend that the
SGA Senate elect their own
chairperson, while the SGA
president concentrates on his
or her role as the diplomatic
representative to the faculty,
administration, and trustees.

There should be a concerted
effort on the part of the SGA
leaders to maintain closer
contact with the student body,
and this can be most ef-
fectively accomplished by
means of offering m
student services, such as the
used-book store, advisory
councils, and self-scheduled
exams. The SGA should also
expand its role as a source of
information for students.

One final recommendation
needs to be made, particularly
in view of Davidson’s rather
unique status as a small
college isolated from the
larger institutions of higher
education.

It is important that the
student governments at dif-
ferent schools maintain
frequent contact with one
another. One school may have
already solved a problem that
another is facirig. Fresh ideas
and new perspectives are
acquired through inter-school
contacts.

More importantly, com-
munication between schools
increases a sense of student
solidarity -- an awareness that
students have unique
problems which could be more
successfully | approached
through a unified effort.

Student government,
whether at Davidson or at a
large university, is not a game
or a joke. To treat it as such is
to abdicate one’s _respon-
sibility to participate in the
decisions which affect our
lives.

Student governments can
only provide limited functions
since rapid turnover and cam-
pus political forces on campus
weaken the students’ hand.
Nevertheless, students will be
playing a more important role
in the decisions on campuses
across the country.

The confrontations of the
late '60s have given way to
cooperation in many in-
stances, and it will be
necessary to have strong
student leadership and unity
during the '70s.
