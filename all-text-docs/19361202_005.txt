“Tides of Malven,” by Francis
Griswold. A]though Mr. Griswold
is a Northerner he caught the charm
of Charleston so well that he seem-
ed by one reviewer to write like
an old Southern gentleman. The
novel traces seven gencrations of
a South Carolina family. “The
book lives, the house lives, the
family lives.” It helps to explain
something of the Southerners’ fecl-
ings for the past which seems to
many a. Yankee ridiculous.

“Peter Ashley” by Du Bose Hey-
ward. Charleston on the eve of
the War. Between the States is the
hectic background. Peter Ashley
has been educated at Oxford and is
a liberal thinker. The feudalism of
his native state seems an anachron-
ism. Race Weck, the slave market,
the duel, are all handled with mas-
terly detail. Peter Ashley is an ex-
tremely accurate type rather than
an individual,

“Look Back to Glory” by Her-
bert Ravanel Sass. This is perhaps
the most glamorous of the roman-
tic tales of low country aristocrats.
South Carofina was dancing on a
volcano and Mr. Sass has captured
the tenseness of the times. The
women dre too beautiful and the
men too brave but after all it's
South Carolina — and fiction.

North Carolina

North Carolina has been less in-
terested in her past than in her
present. Her ‘antebellum planta-
tions were not so large as those of
South Carolina and Virginia, nor
was her history so highly colored.

“Marching On” by James Boyd.
Eastern North Carolina is the scene.
Mr. Boyd's greatest gift as a nov-
elist is his power in making back-
grounds live. Says Miss Cornelia
-Shaw in reviewing this book for
the North Carolina Historical Re-
view (vol. 4 pp. 491-3) “The tour-
nament, the fiddling contest at the
school house, the rice—field negroes
and the funeral of the Scraggs girl
ware pictured without a flaw.”

Virginia

Virginia did much of her literary
work on ante-bellum traditions in
the days of Thomas N. Page and
Mary Johnston. It is said that the
Virginians created the Southern
traditions in literature. In recent
years their work has been less
prolific. To

vil War tales are measured. There
are battle references, but the main
interest is directed towards non-
combatants. Lee, Jackson and otiner

Georgia

Georgia .has the country’s best
seller “Gone With the Wind” to
her credit, and on the same theme
Beénet's poem “John Brown's Body”
which reads like a novel and is as
accurate as history. Readers who
don't care for Southern romances or
for poetry are dared by publishers
to read -these two and remain of
their old opinion.

Mississippi

Mississippi, like South Carolina,
had much to lose and has had diff-
iculty coming back. The greatest

plantations were in these two
states,
“So Red the Rose" by Stark

Young. “Montros” and “Portobello”
are as réal to many readers as any
of the remaining white-pillared
mansions. This is the only one of
the recent novels of this type which
has been interpreted by the cinema.
Alabama

The cradle of the Confederacy
has gone realistic, while there are
novels, the better-known fiction on
ante-bellum Alabama has little to
do with the graces of the gentry.

“The Forge,” by G. S. Stribling.
This is the first of Mr. Stribling’s
trilogy. The Vaiden family is mid-
dle class and as in real life not so
lovely.

Lythe. A story of revenge in which
the Civil War plays only an -inci-
dental part. Critics have said that
page by page this is a better book
than “Gone With the Wind.” Kt is
at present a best seller.
