ber 15 on sick leave from U. S. General
Hospital No. 2, at Fort McHenry, Md.
He has been undergoing treatment
there for injuries reccived while at Camp
Jackson before he. went across and on
his return to the hospital on October 13

students in the Y. M. C. A. office at
the gymnasium, and from 10 a. m. to

For ‘or Coming Year

Staff Has Been Ct Chosen—Six Issues.
Are Planned

Due to the unsettled conditions of the’

past two years, the Davidson College
Magazine was discontinued for the pe-
riod of war. At a recent meeting of
the student body
organize the Magazine with O, P. Hart
as editor-in-chief and Carl Matthews as
business, manager. ‘The first issue is to
appear about October 15 and in order
to have it in the hands of the students
by that time it is necessary that all arti-
cles intended for publication should be
turned in by October 1. Prof. Shew-
make will give credit in the English de-
partment for all articles submitted
whether used for publication or not.
This should prave .a further incentive
for literary productions.

An able staff composed of H. RB.
Brown, essay editor; H. C. Hamilton,
short story editer; ‘T. W. Hawkins.
verse editor; D. L. Mahood, exchange
editor; D. R. Freeman, alumni editor;
R. ‘T, L. Liston, humor and wit editor,
has been selected and it is their purpose
to make the Davidson College Maga-
zine “The Best College Magazine in
the South.” With the hearty co-opera-
tion of all students this should easily be
accomplished.

There will be six issues this year in-
stead of four, as of former years, two is-
sues appearing in the fall term and four
in the spring. “he covers are to be the
best ever used, cartoons will be publish-
ed, and the Magazine will be thorough-
ly up-to-date in every respect.

HEARTY WELCOME EXTEND-
ED CHINESE STUDENT
P. C. MENG.

‘On last F riday evening the first gov-
ernment student from China to come to

Davidson, Paul C. Meng, reached the
college. Meng was born in Yung Ching,
China, near Peking, and there spent his
childhood.
‘Tientsin, a large seaport in
China. where he continued his educa-
tion, begun at Yung Ching. After com-
pleting his preparatory course at ‘Tient-

sin he went to ‘Tsing Hua College. at,

Peking, from which he graduated in
1919. He has now come to America
and is preparing at Davidson for the
work ahead of him in his native land.

Meng is a man of ability. His pleas-
‘ng manner and smiling face have al-
ready won him many friends on. the
campus. It is surprising how well he
speaks the English language. having
never been in this country before, but
he speaks it as well as almost any of us.
We extend to him a hearty welcome to
Davidson College and trust that he will
find a warm place in the heart of the
whole student body.

to Begin His Work

To be Head of Biology Department---
A Man of Wide Experience

Prof. Murray H. Hunt is the latest
addition to the faculty of Davidson. He
comes to us to be the head of the De-
partment of Biology after fourteen
years of experience in teaching. Most
of this time was spent in New Eng-
land. Prof, Hunt graduated from ‘Pufts
University with the B..S. degree, and
has done post-graduate work at Har-
vard and at Dainbury Normal.

In the short time that he has been
here, Prof. Hunt has already
strated a very marked efficieacy in’ the
classroom and laboratory; and is fast
becoming popular with the students who
know him. We feel sure that his work
here will be very highly successful.

MURDER OF COLORED MAN
OCCURS NEAR CAMPUS.

A severe shock was felt, especially by
the colored people of the Davidson com-
munity, upon hearing of the sudden
death of one of their younger members
at § a.m. Friday. George Patterson
was fatally wounded on the night be-
fore his death. Of course the facts of
the case are being withheld until the
trial. It is general information that
through some difficulty of hidden origin
the deceased became involved in a se-
rious scrap with another employee down
at the oil mill. The death blow was
given by a broomstick, supposedly in
self-defense. The defendant is now held
in Charlotte until the course of justice
has been decided.
