The Dean Rusk Program’s Conference on
International Conservation strikes an inter--
‘esting contrast to current national politics.
The Davidson community has the opportu-
nity to discuss the fate of the global environ-
ment, while the presidential candidates and
the national media seem to be ignoring the
issue almost en-
tirely.

, Whichisnottosay
Mr. Bush and Mr.
Gore do not find
plenty to talk about.
. President Clinton’s
recent decision to tap
the nation’s oil re-
serves in an effort to
ease fuel prices gave
both candidates oc-
casion for comment.

Mr. Gore, sup-
ported the decision,
which just happened
to correspond to a
suggestion he him-
self made, and im-
plied that his
opponent’s ties to
big oil might desen-
sitize him to the
plight of consumers.
Gore also called for increased use of alterna-
tive, renewable energy sources as a way to
decrease US dependence on petroleum im-
ports.

Mr. Bush criticized the move and those
behind it, suggesting that the Clinton
administration’s lack of an energy policy has
backed the country into a corner. Further-
more, Bush defended himself and pointed out
that Gore’s family owns a sizeable share in
Occidental Petroleum. He recommended
pushing the OPEC leaders to increase pro-
duction in order to reduce gas prices.

Needless to say, the real issue here is purely

political. Presidential candidates know who

their constituents are. The American middle
and lower classes and their automobiles are
feeling the pinch, and politicians have two
main responses.

1. Find a culprit, and if possible, implicate
the opposition.

OR

2. Propose a solution that sounds reason-
able.

The pressures of the election necessitate
these reactions, but one wonders if either

Mr. Bush or Mr. Gore have seriously as-
sessed the problem of spiraling fuel prices.

In the first place, economists, or at least
those with any influence on policy, generally
agree that the high cost of a barrel of crude oil
does not pose any serious threat to the post-
industrial world. Seen broadly, dependence
on petroleum is not what it once was, as, for
example, during the price shocks of the 1970's.
In addition, the US economy is booming, and

projections seem to indicate continued growth.
Inthe second place, the two proposed scape-
goats, multinational oil companies and oil-
producing nations, are not ultimately at fault
for the sudden rise in prices. Of course, they
have their own interests, and they certainly
tamper with the market. However, global
demand for oil plays a

role in determining

prices at least as large.

if not larger than that
of production quotas.
That same con-
sumer-driven growth
that the US continues
to experience drives
up and sustains the
high price of gasoline.
If the US wants to
force the prices back
down, it must address
its unsustainable, and
yes, unreasonable lev-
els of consumption.
This is simply an
example, but consider
the fuel economy rat-
ings of a few popular
automobiles. The
2000 Dodge Durango
scores an average of
14 miles per gallon (mpg). Moving up the
ladder, the 2000 Ford Expedition gets an
average of 16 mpg. Luxury models fare no
better, with the 2000 Lexus LX 470 sitting at

disregard for er

vironment
14.5 mpg, while the Mercedes-Benz M155
runs a meager 15..5 mpg. At the high end of
. the list is the 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee with
an average rating of 18.5 mpg.

Might we add that one editor’s inherited
1990 Caprice Classic, generally considered a
gas guzzler, rates better than all of those
mentioned above?

The United States has no cause to com-
plain. Not only does our excessive consump-
tion drive up prices for consumers all over the
world, but our gas prices are also lower than
in any other industrialized country. More-
over, we continue to produce the bulk of so-
called “greenhouse gases,” which know no
national boundaries. In short, we use the
most, spend the least, and make life harder on
everyone else.

If policy makers are serious about address-
ing this problem, they could begin by curtail-
ing the use of nonrenewable energy sources,
for example, through higher energy taxes or
through disincentives for those who produce
and purchase low-efficiency automobiles.

Unfortunately, until the oil reserves run
dry, consumers will continue to determine
the rate of consumption. Irresponsible choices
will continue to produce disastrous results,
reinforcing the old adage — You get what you
pay for.

The minority point of view °

Some thoughts from an atheist, feminist,
non-white, non-American who is pro-choice
and pro-gay rights (which probably encom-
passes the majority of minority populations
in Davidson). They are not meant to offend,
and if I inadvertently step on anyone’s toes,
apologies in advance.

My grasp on theology is shaky at best, but
my understanding of the basic concept of
“sin” is an act which causes harm to others. I
fail to see how homosexuality can be sinful,
for there is nothing about it which
harms the individual (unless
you’re talking about the soul,
in which case you first have to
establish that it is a sin) or soci-
ety. It is probably not the stron-
gest proponent of procreation,
but if that were our definition

to designate as sinful all those
who choose not to have chil-
dren.

One common theme I have noticed in the
articles is the exhortation for us (probably
meaning Christians) to love our neighbor. I

__ detect a strong note of patronization here - we

recognize that you have sexual preferences
that are different, but we'll love you anyway
because Jesus loved all, including sinners.
That’s tantamount to saying, well you’ re fat/
thin/ugly/pretty/tall/short/blond/brunette, but
I'll try to like you regardless, because that’s
what the Bible teaches us to do.

That sounds like something straight out of
akindergarten classroom. Furthermore, what
gives you the right to judge others and deem

them “fitting” for your mercy and compas-
sion? I find this indiscriminate blanket love
for all to be as discomforting as condemning
all homosexuals just because they are gay. Of
course, loving everybody causes less imme-
diate injury and violence, but patronizing
acceptance does little to change opinions
towards a marginalized group. It is a solution
that changes the symptoms of a problem
while failing to address the problem itself.
What I have observed of certain Christians
is that they put a lot of store in
what the Bible says when decid-
ing what is moral, what is sin-
ful, what is right, what is wrong.
The Bible says a lot of things,
some of it, as I understand,
contradictory, and quoting
from it to support your stand is
pointless without the injection
of some common sense.
Tax-collectors were once
considered sinful, but you won’t
be seeing much denunciation of tax-collec-
tors; it all seems to be reserved for the lawyers
now. Over time, societal norms change, and
blindly embracing what is in the Bible is
foolish and puerile. The Bible states that
there is only one true God, and all pagans are
sinners. Is it time to mount another Crusade
against the heathen lands? Or perhaps we
should start closer to home with the conver-
sion of the few (well-hidden) Jews, Muslims,
Buddhists, Hindus, agnostics, and atheists on
campus to the True Faith.
