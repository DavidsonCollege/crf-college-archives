Baseball team sweeps Western, takes conference lead

By BOYD COGGINS

Last weekend Davidson took
over first place in the southern di-
vision of the Southern Conference
by winning three straight games
over Western Carolina. For the
week the Cats won six games and
lost only one. Their record now
stands at 6-3 in the conference and
15-5-1 overall.

The Cats began last week’s
play by defeating Youngstown
State by the score of 11-4. David-
son pounded out 12 hits as senior
Scott Weaver pitched a complete
game, striking out 11 men and al-
lowing only four runs over nine
innings. Leading the hitting attack
for the Cats were juniors Dave
Turgeon and Dan Simonds who
each had three hits. Junior Mark
Thompson added two hits, one of
which was a two-run home run in
the first inning.

The only loss Davidson suf-
fered last week was to the Pfeiffer
Falcons in Misenheimer by the
score of 5-1. Pfeiffer’s pitcher
Tony Ford held the Cats to only
four hits as he picked up the vic-

throwing three and two-thirds in-
nings of strong relief.

In the weekend series with
Western Carolina, Davidson con-
tinued their hot hitting attack as
they pounded the Catamounts 16-
2 in the first game of a double-
header played last Friday after-
noon. The Cats got off to an early
lead in the first inning when both
senior Keith Helfant and Lewis
scored on a double by Weaver.

The Cats then blew the game
open in the third inning when they
scored 12 runs on nine hits.
Sophomore Bill Masse and Hel-
fant started the inning with walks.
Turgeon brought Masse home
with a single after Lewis had
reached base on an error by the
centerfielder. Sophomore Roy
Vilardi then brought in Helfant
with a sacrifice fly to left. With
two out the Cats continued their
hitting barrage when Simonds
singled to load the bases. Senior
Tim Waters then ripped a single to
leftfield which scored Lewis and
Turgeon. Depaul followed next
with a three run home run giving

allowed only two runs and struck
out five while running his record
to a perfect 6-0 on the season. Tur-
geon and Depaul each had three
hits to lead the Cats’ 14 hit attack.

In the second game Friday,
sophomore Dave Fitzgerald ran
his record to 2-1 as he struck out
six and allowed the Catamounts
only three runs on five hits in
seven innings. The Cats used
eight hits and five walks to pro-
duce their seven runs.

After reaching base on a
single, Masse began the scoring in
the first inning. Davidson got its
second run in the third inning
when Depaul scored on a sacrifice
fly to center by Helfant.

The Cats got back into the win
column last Thursday against
Gardner-Webb as they collected
ten hits and won 11-4. Weaver
was the leading hitter for the game
as he got four hits in four at-bats.
He had a double, three singles,
and three RBIs: Junior David De-
paul and sophomore Alan Lewis
each hit solo home runs to contrib-
ute to the Cats victory. Freshman
Jeff Loser picked up the victory by

the Cats a 9-1 lead.

Masse, batting for the second
time in the inning, reached base
on an error by the shortstop. Hel-
fant then singled and Lewis fol-
lowed this with the second three-
run home run of the inning for the
Cats to bring home Masse and
Helfant. The Cats finished the in-
ning by scoring two more runs on
a single by Turgeon, a double by
Weaver, and a single by Vilardi.

Davidson scored two more
runs in the fifth inning to complete
their scoring. Junior Steve Con-

was hit by a pitch, scored the sec-
ond run of the inning when Masse
walked with the bases loaded.

Masse added some insurance
runs to the Davidson lead in the
sixth inning when he connected on
a three-run home run to bring
home Waters and Depaul who had
both reached base on singles. For

the game Masse went two for

three with four RBIs.
On Saturday, the Cats con-

blasted five Catamount pitchers to
take a 13-5 victory. Junior Billy
Waitsman pitched the complete
game victory as he scattered 16
Catamount hits to pick up his third
victory of the season against only
one loss.

The Cats picked up two runs in
the first inning when Masse dou-
bled and scored on a hit by Lewis.
Lewis then scored on a fielder’s
choice by Weaver when Western
was unable to convert a double
play. The Cats continued building
their lead as they scored two runs
apiece in the third, fourth, and
fifth innings. Masse rounded out
the scoring in the seventh inning
when he hit a grand slam home run
to bring home Simonds, who had

singled, and Waters and Depaul
who had both walked.

For the game Masse was four
for five with five RBIS and three
runs scored. Turgeon added three
hits on two singles and a triple as
he raised his batting average to a
sizzling .433.

The Cats won their fifth game
in a row last Monday as they hum-
bled the Demon Deacons from
Wake Forest by the score of 20-8.
Davidson pounded out 23 hits of
which five were doubles and five
were home runs. The Cats scored
at least one run in each of the first
seven innings. Their biggest in-
ning was the seventh when they
scored seven runs on six hits. Tur-

geon and Weaver each had four
hits and three RBIs. Waters con-
nected for one of the five David-
son home runs in the second in-
ning when he hit a grand slam.
Weaver pitched a complete game
and picked up his second victory
of the season.

After their game Wednesday
with North Carolina, the Cats
have a chance to extend their lead
in the southern division when they
host the Citadel for three games
this weekend. If the Cats continue
to hit well and get solid pitching
from their starters, they look to be
in good position to whip the
Bulldogs for three more victories.
