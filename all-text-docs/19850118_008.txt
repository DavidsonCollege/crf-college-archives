— Music

A

By STEVE MANK

Almost all music is a barrucuda
gliding swiftly through the water. Oc-
casionally it stops to negotiate the most
exact path, but it never loses sight of its
goal. The music of XTC is a frog that
swims erratically.

Every now and then it gets out of
the water, hops on a lilly-pad, maybe
eats a fly, maybe hops along the pads,
maybe croaks, or maybe even turns
around.

It’s not that anyone’s really heard
of XTC. The band barely managed to
squeak into the top 10 in England! It
hasn’t even broken the American top
100. It released three albums; then dis-
appeared. Two compilations popped
up but the band was hardly appreciated
well enough the first time around to
warrant a compilation.

Members left. Lead singer Andy
Partridge entered an institution. Amer-
ica was happier not even thinking
about XTC (ecstasy, get it?).

But something most peculiar was
happening. Though the group was crit-
ically branded as quirky, the plaudits
were beginning to pile up. The band
wasn’t entering any halls of fame
quickly, but as Partridge presumably

underwent psychotherapy, folks on the
outside began to appreciate him just
the way he was.

In the nick of time, Partridge
dashed out of the “home” (his first offi-
cial statement was, “I’m not crazy any-
more”’), assembled the vestiges of the
formér combo (sans drummer, who
was replaced by a machine), and
created a truly great LP.

The double jointed guitar that
opens The Big Express is poor prepara-
tion for the even weirder stuff to come.
The instruments on “Wake Up” slowly
destroy any preconception you might
have of the value of a good, old
fashioned four-four beat. The music is
positively lopsided.

Far in the background, some Mor-
mon Tabernacle Choir gone berzerk
sings “wake up” over and over like a
juggernaut. And Partridge, sounding

like his hospital gig didn’t do him a bit

XIC: The Big Express

of good, fairly explodes, “Who cares
you might be dead,/ Who cares you
stayed in bed,/ Who cares you wrote
the note,/ Who cares you might have
spoke, WAKE UP!”

Even if the asylum did cure his
manic psychopathy (contrary to the
implications of the first song), a tad of
schizophrenia must remain. As _ the
choir sings its last “wake up,” Par-
tridge begins bellowing the opening st-
rains of “All You Pretty Girls,” a
slightly updated hornpipe, of sorts.

As Partridge escorts you through
the record, you get the feeling not that
he’s going from song to song, but
rather from environ to environ. Each
track, though entirely different, shares
a quality of wholeness. Every
snaretop, every echo, every flat note is

important.
“I Remember the Sun” must be an
avant-garde jazz parody — or is it

avant-garde jazz? Partridge, perhaps
more than any other songwriter,
knows what it is like to be entirely ab-
sorbed in another world, and he knows
how to absorb others into another
world.

“The Everyday Story’ of
Smalltown,” takes up where “Penny
Lane” and “Pleasant Valley Sunday”
left off. But unlike the Beatles or the
Monkeys, XTC replaces the 60’s
naive optimism with post-punk sen-
sibilities. Smalltown does not boast
“blue, suburban skies,” rather the
township is “racing the hooter that’ll
signal life’s up.” Sounds like Partridge
also has a bit of a death fixation to
work out.

But if there is any instability still
lingering, Partridge certainly can work
his way around it well enough. He’s a
little flat, a little off-key, and his gram-
mar is barely comprehendible, but in
some disarmingly sincere sort of way,
“You're the Wish You are I Had” is the
most beautiful song of the last few
years.

Barry Manilow can roll like water
off a duck’s back, but Partridge has
found the most perfect way to express
love.

It is possible that Andy Partridge is
not crazy anymore — anything’s pos-
sible. If so, he’s still retained enough
of his early skittishness. Truth be
known, The Big Express is not going to
make it into the charts. Despite all the
excellent stuff that goes into XTC’s
sound, the hand is still too weird to be
popular. But that’s probably better.
For as long as the barracuda swims in
front of the frog, the frog can’t be

eaten. Besides, frogs are smarter any-
way.
