The University of Massachusetts at Amherst, where
there are more A’s given than any other grade, has started
to count F’s as zeros in computation of a person’s grade

point average. New party formed

A new political party, the Independence Party of North —
Carolina attempts to rally a large voter turnout in
this state’s national elections.

Hoping to organize a platform to deal with the crisis
within the building industry, dignity for the aged,
joblessness, education, crime, interest rates, and the ever
rising cost of food and utilities, the party will slate Ronald
Reagan for President of the United States and George

MacCormac cited the recent
Rocky River project as es-
pecially successful. He praised
both students and faculty who
worked on the project.

Avinger, also commenting
on the Rocky River Project,
said; “It brought in hard
science and social science to-
gether and it was a good
program.”

“The role of the Honors
Center is not just an elitist
preserve, but as an enlighten-
ing institution for the entire
campus,” he said.

He pointed out that the
Center often had films and
speakers for everyone and that
attendance from students
varied from one to about
ninety.

“T see the role of the Honors
Center as not to deprecate
with a department or to com-
pete with a department but to

offer an'alternate track for the
interests of students,’’ said
Avinger.

“The Honors Center is not
separated from what’s across
‘the street. Its function is to
stimulate the intellectual life
of Davidson College, not just
the Honors Center,’’ said
MacCormac.

Courses there are not strict-
ly for honors students. Pre-
ference is given first to honors
students, then to students
within the major, but if stu-
dents feel qualified, there are
courses available for them at
the Honors Center.

“I’m generally disappointed’

that many students don’t
avail themselves of depart-
mental honors,’’ he said.

“However, I was surprised
how little badgering of stu-
dents had to be done. They
generally worked well, and the
faculty worked well.’’

The duties of the Honors
Dean include ‘‘selecting fa-
culty and students, organizing
the programs, teaching, ac-
tually a little bit of every-
thing,” said MacCormac. ._

“I’m afraid that with my
work in the Honor Center it
will mean having two half-
time jobs,’’ said Avinger,
‘‘and as you know two half-
time jobs never equal a whole,
its always more. ~

“I see my main duties,
however, as administrative.
I'll be formulating programs,
selecting students and staff
and evaluating students,’”’ he
said. “‘I also want to try and
get financial support for the
Center and that’s always a
tough job.”

of sponsors for the show, and
the search for a qualified juror
each year have to be done by
someone who knows the ins
and outs of the art world and
the people he is dealing with,
according to Jackson.

In repeated letters to Col-
lege President Samuel R.
‘Spencer Jr., Jackson re-
quested the addition of a new
faculty member to the Art
Department. He maintains
that ‘‘the need for a new
faculty member in the Art
Department is unrelated to the
Davidson National, but would
have been essential if he were
to devote more time to the

project. The new faculty mem-
ber’s duties would have in-
cluded helping with the Na-
tional to a degree,’’ but teach-
ing would be his primary
function. Jackson has indi-
cated that whether the college
funded the National or not, it
would not continue to run

_under his direction. ‘‘I have

made the conscious decision,”’
he said, “‘to put my time and
effort into other areas. I must
have that time.

“Spencer indicated that he
didn’t want the show to end
when I told him last fall,’’
continued Jackson. ‘‘He asked
how we could keep it:-Even

though I did not wish to
continue, I reluctantly made a

The National has acquired a

great prestige over its five
-years in existence. It has cost

the College very little in that
time. ‘‘If the National had

‘paid for itself completely, I

would havejbeen happy,”’ said

Jackson. As' for the artists
