Double Cheese but

Hold The Fraternity

AUSTIN, Texas (CPS) -- John
Houston never thought a couple

ternity would earn hinrddzéns of

book and health club member-
ships that he didn’t want.

The fraternity down the street
never thought Houston would re-
port them for placing the fake
orders for goods and servicés in
his name.

On Sept. 11, members of Tau
Kappa Epsilon pleaded no con-
test to a forgery charge and were
fined $10,000 for the fraudulent
orders.

The fraternity members sent
the orders to Houston’s residence
after he repeatedly called the po-
lice to handle noise complaints

Floating A Trial Balloon
WALNUT CREEK, Calif. (CPS)
-- College graduates appealing for
jobs with resumes should take
note. What you really might need
is a lot of hot air.

AnitaO’ Hearn, a3 1-year-old
music teacher who wants a new
career, recently bypassed Tradi-
tional Job-Secking Strategies 101
for Creative Self-Selling -- she’s
advertising on a hot-air balloon.

O’Hearn presented a black-
and-white photo of herself on one
side and her telephone number
with the sign “Anita Job” on the
other.

She floated her personal ap-
peal over an interstate in Oakland
last week. But for fiow, no job
offers have wafted her way.

to avoid hurting any of the crea-

“We’re not going to be killing

Thecombination of more part-
time faculty and a relatively low
listed increase in faculty salaries
was the only factors in Davidson’ s
drop from thirteenth to fortieth in
the faculty resources category.

Davidson also dropped in the
category of financial resources.
This category is explained as the
1990 dollar total of a college’s
educational and general expendi-
tures divided by its total full-tume
equivalent enrollment. In 1990
Davidson was ranked thirty-sev-
enth; in 1991 the coHege was
ranked fifty-first in this category.

According tothe 1990 survey,
the amount spent on each student
was $17,721. This year’s issue
listed the amountspentas $18,778.
This is an increase of around six
percent.

Morse said, “Davidson has
relatively less spending per stu-
dentcompared to the 140 schools.”
Hesaid, “Basically the other people
went up more than six percent.”
Davidson lost ground to schools
that increased by larger percent-
ages.

Williams said, “T think that you
will find that rankings follow en-
dowments rather closely. We’re
fairly happy but poor.” He said,

“This institution is underendowed
in terms of financial resources.”

Williamscommented that most
of the money raised in the “Cam-
paign For Davidson” is going to
the endowment. Williams said,
“We need to have this campaign to
stay in place.”

In the category of academic
reputation Davidson rose slightly
from number eighteen to number
sixteen. In student selectivity the
college moved from number five
to number six. In student satisfac-
tion Davidson dropped slightly
from number eight to number
eleven,

Williams said, “Its interesting
that we rank highest in student
selectivity and student satisfaction.
This is great.”

Dean of Admissions Homer
Sutton said, “It concerns me that a
few small adjustments in year to
year circumstances, such as add-
ing a few more part-time faculty
members, can make you drop from
number ten tonumber twenty-one.”

He said, “U.S. News & World
Report should refine their system
toreflectlong-term excellence. Its
makes you realize that these sur-
veys are a little bit grasping at
straws.”

Sutton also said, “I don’t think :

anybody decides to go to college
on whetheraschool is eighth, tenth,
or twenty-first on the U.S. News
World & Reportsurvey. Its a good

source of name recognition, but
choice of college must go deeper
than this.”

Davidson College President
John Kuykendall said, “It is al-
waysa privilege to be listed among
such fine institutions.” He said,
“U.S. News & World Report is the
precursor of a whole generation of
popularity contests. The maga-
zine has tried to quantify and be
objective, but we shouldn’t be
heartened by moving up or dis-
heartened by moving down.”

Kuykendall also. commented
on Davidson being ranked second
in best buys of national liberal arts
colleges. He was glad to see this
but wished that there was a little
more evaluation put into determin-
ing this best buys category.

U.S. News began its survey of
America’s colleges by publishing
biennial issues from 1983 to 1987.
After 1987 the survey became an
annual issue for the magazine.
Davidson tied for the ninth spot in
the 1983 survey, the highest rank-
ing that the college has received
yet.

‘ In £985 only the top ten na-
tional liberal arts schools. were
listed, and Davidson was not a
member of this group. In. 1987
Davidson was ranked fifteen, in
1988 the college was ranked
twenty, in 1989 fifteen again and
in 1990 Davidson was ranked
number ten. i
