Davidson shallow without athletics

By BRUCE HOLLIDAY
Sports Editor

Davidson College undoubt-
edly presents a unique atmos-
phere for both Varsity and
non-varsity sports. As a re-
sult, there is often a great deal
of controversy surrounding
the question of what sports
mean to our academically-ori-
ented college.

I’ve worked closely with all
phases of Davidson’s sports
for two years and have come to
the conclusion that without its
sports program, Davidson
would be a shallow community
indeed. True, a great deal of
money is spent on football and
basketball that could be spent
on chemistry supplies or more
books for E.H. Little Library.
But isn’t Davidson’s level of
academics already strong

WOMEN’S basketball, founded

enough?

The type of individuals in-
troduced to our college by the
varsity programs as well as
the atmosphere surrounding
those programs add a great
deal of needed depth to the
school. For the most of us, our
careers after Davidson will not
be solely concerned with aca-
demics, so why should David-
son limit itself to that particu-
lar area? Just as speakers and
musicians add depth to our
experience, so do varsity
sports.

Because sports are so im-
portant we just support the
work done by the coaches and
the players. This is especially
true now that football and
basketball are involved in
transition periods. Hopefully
in the future both sports will

needs of women to compete

deal of school pride. But even
if they don’t produce winning
seasons we must not measure
their worth in terms of games
won. It sounds trite to say it,
but the important point is
participation— not success.

The low-key varsity sports
such as field hockey, swim-
ming, and wrestling are not
very well-funded but contri-

sports are more important
than either football or basket-
ball.

Finally, Davidson could ne-

is without IMAC sports. Be-

intramurals are also one of the

concentrate on exchanging
names instead of menacing

Sports at Davidson offer a
great deal to the total well-be-
ing of the college. I only hope
that we don't lose sight of this
fact and let athletics suffer in
favor of the more scholastic
pursuits.
