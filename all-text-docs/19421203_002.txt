Narrow Minds...

Students are careless. Not just David-
son students, perhaps, but all students.
Not just aboup material things, either,
but often about things. which can
often do cause much more serious
irreparable damage.

and
and

We refer to the way in which we often
laugh and joke about and often to a boy
who in some way we may consider queer,
possibly because he is physically differ-
ent from us or more often because he
holds some difference in ideas from our
mean, narrow-minded average.

Did it ever occur to any of us as we
snickered behind our cynical_hands that
perhaps it is not the individual with

_ whom we make such sport that is a little
peculiar? When we accuse someone of
being different would we not do well to
consider whether it might not be better if
all of us would deviate from the crowd a
little ourselves ?

We live in a limited, well-ordered so-
ciety, associating with the same elite
group of friends constantly until we
talk, act, dress, and even look like the
entire group. Then we glance at the
outsiders and laugh at them because they
do not use the same slang, the same man-
.herisms, the same sloppy habits that the
“fellers” have acquired,

It a boy is different, that is all the
more reason that’as Davidson or any
other kind of gentlemen we should do
all in our power to help him, not to make
him miserable. For this reason more
good hoys than we would care to admit
have been driven away from this campus
on whose democracy and friendship we
like to brag.

But we are not as cruel to these boys
as we are to some, of the more unfair
cases who we “cut” largely from hear-
say. These are the ones whom we never
bother to get to know because one of our

clique once made a careless remark about
some chance word or action the person in
question might or might not have said
or done,

It all boils down to the fact that a
large part of the student body is narrow
minded, not perhaps in the usual conno-
tation of the term, but then there is
more than one way of being narrow.

Probably the most common form of
narrowness which we are likely to en-
counter among students is intolerance
of intolerance. A belief that another stu-
dent does not approve of what we ap-
prove of, a condition for which a num-
ber of names have been devised, will
cause immediate placement on the “list”
to which there is so much reicrence.

The most common criticism of David-
son as an institution by its students deals
vaguely with its “‘prep-schoolishness”’,
whtatever_that means. We can think of
no more juvenile attitude than that under
discussion,

The point, it seems, is obvious. Who
are we to judge? Have we the right to

make the lives of class and college mates |

unhappy because of some.real or fancied
queerness in their lives? The answer is
equally obvious.

A Way To Serve...

The following editorial is taken di
rectly from a letter sent to college news-
papers from the Association of Ameri-
can Colleges, with headquarters in New
York. Its faets should make us more

understanding about our travel discon-
forts and its suggestion should help us
alleviate them,

As everyone knows, the railroads are
doing—a—tremendous job of moving
masses of men and materials for the war
effort. But the strain’ on the nation’s
rail facilities. is becoming increasingly
acute, particularly in the passenger ser-

‘vice. The Pullman Company, for in-

stance, will transport some 7,000,000
troops in organized movements this year
alone, and on certain days half of the
company’s entire fleet.of sleeping cars is
“in the service.”’

Take-this-mounting military traffic,
add the-hundreds of thousands of civ-
ilian travellers engaged in essential war
work and then throw in haphazardly
one hundred thousand or more college
students homeward bound for the holt-
days and it may easily be seen what an
epic traffic jam could result. Fortunate
ly, most schools, Dr. Guy E. Snavely of
the Association of American Colleges
reports, are aware of the danger and-are
staggering closing dates so that no more
than one college-in-a-single-area_closes
or re-opens on the same day. But there
must be individual cooperation by the
students, too, if troop movements are to
be made on schedule, if vital war mater-
ials are to reach factories and docks on
time.

College students can help most to keep
the tracks clear for vital wartime use by
not travelling during the peak period
from December 15 to January 15. If they
must go home there are some simple rules
to follow which will help to keep rail
travel running smoothly. They are:

1, Make Pullman reservations early. °
It helps railway men gauge the traffi¢_

and provide adequate facilities.

2. Cancel Pullman tickets promptly
when plans ‘are changed. Someone else
can use your accommodations and, be-
sides, if you cantel after train departure
time you can no longer get a refund.

3. Take as little luggage as possible.
There isn’t room in crowded cars for
peacetime paraphernalia.

4. Accept available accommodations.
You cannot always get just the accom-
modations you prefer or find space
available on the-train you usually take.’

Few restrictions have thus far been
placed-upon-civilian_travel.. Willing pub-
lic cooperation in the observance of stich
simple voluntary rules as the foregoing
has 'been a big factor in this excellent
railroad performance. College students,
as members. of the public, can do their
part by also observing these rules, par-
ticularly during the critical holiday per-
iod that lies ahead.

~ With The Staff

By HOWELL MORROW

We recently spent several days
in the college infirmary due to the
discomforts of a severe cold. While
reclining on the divan in the waiting
room and grieving over the sad
state of affairs, we observed the
following incidents.

The door slowly opened and a
sad = looking: individual stumbled
awkwardly into the room. Hig mode
of locomotion is still somewhat of a
puzzle. He seemed to be limping on,
one leg ahd dragging the other, and

~during -his~progress he uttered the

most heart-rending moans and_sighs.
Some kind student, taking pity
on the poor soul, asked him what
accident had -occurred. Two dread-
ful words came from the cripple's
lips. “Murder ball”, he muttered and
collapsed into the nearest chair.

This

and nurse did not seem dis-
and acted as if such unfor-
individuals. were too—num-
erous to cause any undue concern.
Our poor maimed-and- gasping stu-
dent remained a crumpled heap in
his chair and the sick call procedure
moved on in its usual way.
Presently a strange and-awe-in-
spiring spectacle appeared at the
door. A huge nose swollen to several
times its normal size entered fol-
lowed by a small and timid student
who had to be led because he was
unable to see around his oversized
proboscis. The nurse came to the
door, looked casually at the doctor
and said, “A broken nose; that
makes five today”. The trembling
