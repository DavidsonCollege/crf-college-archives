any other Wednesday. The David-
sonian came out on Wednesdays
back then, so students read articles
about the new college plan and the
possibility of a black fraternity on
campus. Everything seemed per-
fectly normal.

It was the last Davidsonian

.they would see until three weeks
later.

At five in the morning on Fri-
day, September 22, the chaos of
Hurricane Hugo swept through
Charlotte, decimating everything
in its path. Winds reportedly
reached 87 miles per hour. It was
like a freight train, those who re-
member say, except it was right
outside your window.

Davidson students awoke to
‘driving rains and literally hundreds
of downed trees and branches. 231
out of a total of 2000 trees on the
campus suffered damage or fell.
Many had stood for over 100 years
and could never be replaced, espe-
cially at an estimated value of
$2000 a tree.

With electricity out, the col-
lege called off classes that Friday.
Students emerged from their dorms
tosurvey the damage. Watts dorm
lost a part its roof, whiie Johnston
Gym and the three sophomore
apartments suffered roof leakage.
A tree also hit Rusk house. An-
other took off roofing shingles and

Some students had cars
crushed, like one senior whose
Honda suffered $3000 of damage.
For. the most part, however,
Davidson got off easy. Every-
where the trees fell in just the right
direction, like the huge oak across
the President’s House lawn, or the
several trees outside the large Com-
mons windows.

In the midst of disaster, the
entire community showed a re-
markable sense of altruism. As
President Kuykendall summarized
in a letter printed in the Davidso-
nian, students and staff “took the
weekend’s adversity as an oppor-
tunity for service rather than an
occasion for dissatisfaction or de-
spair.”

PiKA members cleaned up
Main Street residents’ back yards,
while SAEs served refreshments
to the Duke Power workers. Ev-
erywhere students and college
employees threwin a helping hand,
Many of these Duke Power em-
ployeeshad come from otherstates,
even as far as Ohio.

Thanks to their dedicated
work, electricity was restored
quickly. In Charlotte, some neigh-
borhoods waited weeks for theirs
to come back on.

The Commons opened up with
free meals for all students and
workers. Electricity there returned

On September 22, 1993 the Davidson community gathered together to clean up the destruction left
in the wake of Hurricane Hugo. No verterans of the storm still attend Davidson as students.

on Saturday, so spoilage took only
$500 worth of food. Employees
worked overtime all weekend to
handle the crowds.

Today, one can hardly imag-
ine the extent of destruction on the
campus. Even when the class of
‘94 came as prospectives two weeks
later, crews continued to work re-
moving massive tree trunks.

Charlotte looked like some-
one had dropped a small atom
bomb, with piles of wood stacked
in piles as tall as a person all along
the sidewalks. Several interstate
signs were missing, including the
northbound Davidson exit sign.

Not. surprisingly, someone had
dragged it to Akers Dorm where it
remained for a week.

Even now we continue to live
with the legacy of Hugo. Walk
through the old quadrangle be-
tween Oak and Elm Row, just in
front of Cunningham Fine Arts
building. Notice that not one of the
trees has a top anymore. Or take a
walk through the woods around
campus and notice the sheer num-
ber of downed trees. : You can
barely get through the woods be-
cause of all the rotting tree trunks.

Perhaps one of the most inter-
esting legacies of Hugo involved

the new Visual Arts Building. The
Art Department had planned to
reveal the preliminary Graham
Gund Architects' design at a lun-
cheon that Friday, but for obvious
reasons the event was canceled and
rescheduled for November 1, 1989.
Funny enough, the design looks
very little like what our new build-
ing does.

Information from this article
came from the October 11 and
November 8, 1989 issues of the

Davidsonian as well as recollec-
tions of various Davidson
students and staff.

Athletic Department will not extend Baker hours before use increases

Baker continued from page 1

its hours do not match students’
schedules. Rudell commented that
students become frustrated when
facilities such as the weight room
and pool are shut down because
work-study students, upon which

Baker heavily depends, do not
show up for work.

Athletic Director Terry Hol-
land contended that it is not fea-
sible to extend hours of operation
because of staff size constraints
and budget concerns. Dean of Stu-
dents Will Terry explained that the

Lower totals didn't discourage ROTC
blood drive volunteers or organizers

Both Hawkins and McKinney
agreed that the spring drive should
have a better donor turnout be-
cause there will be more notice.
Therefore, publicity will begin ear-
lier and there will be more time to
recruit donors.

Compared to last year’s drive
goal, this year’s goal .was less.
However, the drive came closer to
the goal number this year. Last
year’s goal was higher and there

Crime Report

On September 26 at 6:10
p.m.,athree-wheel “EZ-GO” golf
cart belonging to the Sports Medi-
cine Department was reported to
the police as stolen. A workstudy
employee for Sports Medicine re-
ported the theft; no suspects were
found. Valued at about $600, the
golf cart had been left unlocked
and was last seen behind Baker at
5:30 p.m. The next day, the cart
was found undamaged in the

woods behind Baker.

were significantly more donors.

This fall ROTC members were
not allowed to volunteer to help
the Red Cross with the blood drive.
The Red Cross has a new policy
that involves training in order to be
avolunteer. There was not enough
time for training so Red Cross
brought their own volunteers. Al-
though McKinney commented that
the Red Cross was great.

Senior Jennifer Whittington
donated blood for the first time and
she remarked that she gave blood
because, “somebody else might
need it more than I do.”

Four time freshman donor Zac
Lacey said he is a donor because,
“my sister was in a car accident
and had to have a transfusion. I
think it is an important thing all
people should do.”

Inaddition tothe Blood Drive,
ROTC sponsored the Davidson
Lions Club.

They asked many people,
“Want to donate your eyes?” urg-
ing students to become eye and
organ donors.

athletic budget has been frozen at
9.2% of the total college budget.

Assistant Athletic Director
Ron Morrow noted that during
January, February, and March of
1993 Baker was open until mid-
night on weekends.

For those months, an average
of 2.4, 1.48, and 2.38 people, re-
spectively, entered Baker between
the hours of 10-midnight.

Currently Baker closes. at 10
each night. Rudell commented
thatthe 8-10 timeslotis very popu-
lar for meetings and other campus
activities; therefore, the building
should be opened later when stu-
dents would be able to utilize the

facilities.

Holland remarked that for
Baker to be opened extra hours,
resources would have to be pro-
cured from areas outside of the
athletic budget.

He argued that it would not
make sense to take money away
from other areas if there is not a
demonstrated need for Baker to be
open later.

Both Morrow and Holland
stressed that students are theirnum-
ber one priority. “This building is
far more available to students than
any other multi-purpose building
in the country,” declared Holland.

If a need to keep Baker open

later than 10 p.m. can be demon-
strated then administrators will
reallocate funds to meet students’
demands.

It was also agreed that there
should be some means for students
to register complaints such as
through a suggestion or comment
box.

The student group vows to
continue to lobby for alternative
late-night athletic activities.

Following the meeting
Srinivasan expressed that both
sides realized that they have to
work together to get student in-
volvement. Rudell said that it was
good to the focus on students.

Court forum discusses possible changes

Court continued from page 1

the panelists drew toa close, ques-
tions from the audience were ad-
dressed.

According to many ofthe stu-
dents that were present, they were
well informed about the changes
that need to be made in order for
Patterson Court to attain a better

image.

The two administrators that
were in attendance were the Assis-
tant Director of the Union and
Patterson Court Adviser Kurt
Holmes. No faculty members were
present. Julie Petty said, “This is
frustrating because faculty mem-
bers tend to be the most critical of
Patterson Court.”

The forum was another way to
allow those members of the
Davidson College community to
see the progress and changes that
both have been made and need to
be made on Patterson Court. -

The newly formed Patterson
Court Council has had a large
impact on the college over the last
six months. The major changes
that have occurred have been the
alcohol issue and the flexibility in
the social activities on the court.

The forum was thought to bea
positive as well as successful ex-
perience for those who were in-
volved. “The majority of those
who attended had a willingness to
change things on the court and at
the same time understand the ef-

forts of the Patterson Court Coun-
cil,” said Julie Petty.

The forum is considered to be
an optimistic outlook on the future
of Patterson Court. As Kurt
Holmes stated, “Forums cause very
little change buttend to raise aware-
ness.”
