DAVIDSONIAN / Friday 8 January 1982

ragtime -- and made it hot. Some 25 years after Mor-
ton’s death, pianist Bob Greene put together a group in
the mid 60’s that eerily plays Morton’s music note for
note. It lives again. “Greene is startling! . . . it was

Morton himself onstage.” - New Yorker.

The Intimate P.D.Q. Bach (Friday, February 5; Satur-
day, February6; 8:15. pm; $10.00; students, $6. 00)
Professor Peter Schickele’s hilarious spoof brings
to-audiences the music of the heretofore undiscovered
(for reasons which will be made clear) son of the great
Johann Sebastian Bach, and proves conclusively that
“like father, like son” is not necessarily true.
- A side splitting evening.
