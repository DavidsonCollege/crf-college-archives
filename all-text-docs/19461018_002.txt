Pride and Admiration .. .

In Davidson's glorious history, pages
have been filled with the valor of Wild-
cat teams of years gone by. My years are
entirely too few to speak with authority
of our sturdy: Warriors of many moons
ago, but I can say truthfully that during
my years as a Davidson student I have
never seen one of our elevens in action
which showed more. spirit, courage or
gameness than our team possessed in Ral-
eigh last’ Saturday night. Unfortunately,
spirit alone is not enough, for there is a
limit to the physical capacity of mankind.
As Coach Charlie Jameson says, “We
had the best, motor, but we gave out of
gas.” Reserve power told the age old story,
for Davidson definitely had the better
ball club at the outset, Neither Davidson
students nor anyone who witnessed the
contest will ever forget the showing that
the men from Alenda Lux made that
night. Men like Dick O’Hair, Easy
Rhodes, and Buddy Chandler, who played
on when there was nothing left to keep
them in motion but heart, will long be
remembered for the showing they made.
There is no grief on Davidson’s campus
today. . . only pride in a job well done, a
great admiration for the men who did it,
and a word of warning to Wildcat op-
ponents of the future.

Dances......

Homecoming dances are just around the

proverbial corner and Merry MacChesny
Jeffries can be seen about the campus
with a spring in his step and a twinkle
in his eye. Reason? He just signed a con-
tract with Bobby Byrne to play for the
set. This will be Dayidson’s first Home-
coming set since the dances given back in
1942, for the war years were lean years at
Davidson, and-alumni were in the service
which almost always prevented their at-
tendance, In keeping with the great grow-
th of everything else at Davidson this year,
this set of dances should prove to be the
biggest and best Homecoming group that
has ever been presented here. In the pre-

war years it was the policy of the Pan-

legiate organization for this- particular
set. Their plan was to make a profit on
these intitial dances which was to be ap-
plied towards s@€ring a band of nation-
al reputation for the Mid-Winters and
Spring sets. With the much larger stu-
dent body this term, the council feels that
it will be able to finance a ‘‘name” organi-
zation for Homecoming. This can be suc-
cessfully accomplished, however, only if
the. students give their full support to
the dances. If through lack of support
from the students, the set goes in the hole,
it will be necessary to rely on strictly local
talent for the remainder of the year. It.is
therefore urged that we turn out for the
festivities. The prices on the set tickets
seem very reasonable in view of the fact
that during the past three years, prices
for orchestras of only medium caliber
haye ranged at about the same fee. For
instance, the band for Mid-Winters of
1945 was an organization working out of
Winston-Salem under the name of John
Peddicord. Set tickets for the affair were
priced at $4.75 plus tax, which is only
twenty-five cents less than a block ticket
for the coming dances. Needless to say,
John Peddicord’s selections cannot com-
pare with the music furnished by Byrne
and his orchestra, who has appearances at
The Meadowbrook, the Raleigh Debutant
Ball, New York’s famous Roseland Ball-
The
Davidsonian urges the full support of the

room, and Georgia Tech Dances.

‘student body for the dances because such
must be the case if they are to be success-
ful, and because: we feel that this will

truly be a week-end that will be enjoyed
It will bring back old memories to be
heading for the Queen City for dances
once again. I can well remember the long
fight for campus dances which culminated
in the students request being granted. It
is too bad that it was impossible to com-
plete the proposed new gymnasium this
year for that would -indeed have added
the final touch to the occasion. The situa-
tion is not a critical one now, though, for
the days of gas rationing are gone and
transportation will offer no serious pro-
blems. The problem which is confronting
most students today seems to be that of
securing accomodations for their dates
during the week-end. Students who have
not already found rooms for their fair
friends are requested to do so at the earlist
possible date.

This and That....

Buddy Whitesides tells the story of the
Davidson student at the State game who
was sitting just behind the Davidson
bench,

and who continually screamed,
“Down in Front!” For a long time no
one could tell to whom his cries were be-
ing addressed until finally somebody in-
formed the loud young man that the man
Standing so often and blocking his vision
was none other than Coach Bill Story. It
is reported that the student melted into
the crowd.

It might be well for the Davidson stu-
dents to take note of the! fine organiza-
tion of the State cheering section. Their
yells were executed with perfect precision.
Of course they had a large section, but

COLUMN

hy

JIM JACKSON

This week’s column is written
by a very well known member of
our stdent body, whose great mod-
esty will not allow his name to be
mentioned. In other words, reg-
ular columnist Jim Jackson is not
responsible.

After much deliberation as to a
subject for this week’s column, and
after conferring with other mem-
bers of the staff, I decided to dedi-
cate it to the many Davidson men
back in school who helped to win
World War Il—6our returning war
heroes. We all realize, however,
that it is an.impossibility even to
list by name all the veterans. So
we have selected one veteran of
both war-time Europe and occupa-

ition Europe as a typical example of

Davidson heroes—McChesney Hill
Jeffries of Thomasville, Georgia. ©

Mac tells us that after three
years of R. O. T. C. at Davidson
he started his army career with
four gruesome ‘months of basic
training at Camp Wheeler,  Ga.,
where he learned the art of anti-
tank gunnery during daylight hours
and the art of dancing, Macon-
style during hours of darkness.

The remainder of his state-side
career included a rise in yank to
Pfc, corporal, and shavetail, while
stationed at Mississippi State (A.
S. T. P.), Fort Benning (0. C. S.),
and Camp Shelby (A. N. C.)

Mac set sail for Picadilly in

November, 1944, where he estab-
lished a—PX- for WAGs. stationed
in London. It was here that the
night problems in basic training
stood him in good stead, and he was
so effective at servicing his WAC
detachment that he was personally
selected by the general to leave
England.

He hit the combat zone, and on
sight was assigned to regimental
headquarters, where he earned the
bronze star interrogating enemy
female captives.

The occupation found Mac with
the famed Rainbow Division in
Austria, where he befriended a lit-

tle Austrian gal (age 19), who had

been orphaned by the war.

During the remainder of his over-
seas time, Mac drew army~pay as
a first lieutenant, though his pri-
mary job was the fostering of
Austro-American relations.

Mac further distinguished him-
self as an occupation hero by saving
an Austrian fraulein who vainly en-
deavored to drown herself after
being frustrated in love.

Mac closed the interview with
this statement: “I sincerely hope
that this enlightening interview
will bring an end to these shame-
ful, sordid, sinful, malicious ru-
mors that my so-called friends have
been conspicuously “circulating
about the campus.”

” “Masquerade in Mexico”

“Masquerade in Mexico” stars
Dorothy Lamour and Arturo de
Cordova. Unless this motion pic-
ture is masequerading around the
files under another name this re-
porter has not been able to locate
it. However Dotty’s figure should
be easily recognizable Whether it
be masqued or not (I hope). Any-
way let’s put on our feed bag and
go!

This marks the first in a series
of Mexican movies.

“Holiday in Mexico”

A picture pleasant to both eye

of plot. Jane Powell, sub-deb
daughter of U. S. ambassador to
Mexico. (Walter Pidgeon) falls for
British ambassador’s young son
(Roddy McDowall) but retains her
soxer crush for famous pianist
Jose Iturbi (Jose Ittirbi). During

tion Jose plays, Jane sings (and

“Till the End of Time”

As to whether this movie solves
the post-war probtéms of any ex-
GI I will not veture to say, but
it is a story of four bewildered
young people and how “they found
themselves”. Here are the prob-
lem children: Dorothy McGuire
who is not able to overcome her
romantic ‘daydreams which went
down in France with her flyer
husband; Bill Williams, an ex-
fighter, who cannot accustom him-
self to his new artificial legs; Guy
Madison, unharmed, even with his
bobby-soxer appeal, finds that he

is unable to adapt himself to civil-
ian life; and Robert Mitchum with
a silver plate in his head takes to
drink to forget all. (Um-m-m! I’d
like to forget studies.) The musical
score, “Till the End of Time,” is

very well done.

Raleigh played host to the Da-
vidson footballers last week end.
It also played host to the most
magnificent gathering of dealers
since the Debutante Ball, for the
BMOC’s were out en masse. There
will be other football games in
the North Carolina capital city.
There will never be another week
end like the last one... or so
the harassed and incompetent desk
clerk.of the Sir Walter was heard
to gasp as he succumbed to the
power of fraternity pins and sport
coats.

Fame was gained. That fame

seen leading the lad into the in-
closing shadows of Riddick Sta-
dium. Yes HARRY did well. He
even paid for his high-ceiling ex-
penses with an ingenious *trick. He
secured blind dates for his friends,
from the pre-week-end view, and
wagered with each that he would
achieve success in his osculatory
maneuvers. He won a fabulous
sum (one dollar).

RICHARD LESTER PORT was
missing even more than usual after
the game. His projected junket to
South Carolina fell through at the
last minute when the Florence lasg
wired regrets. She must have
heard what the frauleins couldn’t
understand. ... BILL “ESQUIRE”
HODGIN planned to cap his holiday
in a safe fashion and managed to
do so after a forty-five minute
search,. . . BLACK JACK SHEL-
TON played a great game for the
few minutes that he was on the
field, but Coach Pfohl kept him
under wraps in reserve for the V.
M. I. trip.

“LUCKY” GAITHER was over-
heard rejoicing that the cold

Fa\

weather has finally come. He’s

been wanting to get into long
handled underwear for years. The
latest telegram from Barbara No.
1 was signed with her full name
after last week’s mixup. It was
a flush note. PENGUIN CARROW,
reduced to low level flying with
a broken wing, was also lowered by
the’ lady friend. When told that
her man had suffered the recur-
rence of an old football injury,
the l’il woman queried, ‘“Whassa-
matter, did somebody step on
him?” But the PENGUIN seemed
right at home, hobbling in and out
of the Sir Walter and its facili-
ties.

ED GOLDEN won the prize, but
was too modest to admit it. Al-
though he wheeled his blind (and
otherwise encumbered) date
amongst his fellow Phi Delts the
entire week end, not once would
he give the Greek an introduction.
... FOOTSIE CURRIE, suffering
from habits built up in the service,
refused to allow any khaki clothing
around while he sought entertain-
ment after the game. . . GRIM-
BALL, BAXTER, DUNN, BACH-
MAN and a couple of socially in-

clined freshmen cheered with spirit
and stimulation, but decided to re-
turn Saturday night after looking
over the situation.

ROSSO CLARK spent the week
end in quiet contemplation, trying
to decide between Mt. Holly and
Belmont as a site for future opera-
tions. ... THE HAT strolled cas-
ually about the streets of Raleigh
in the brown Homburg that made
such a hit during rush week. It
should go over big at Wake For-
est.

BUMBARGER'S at it again. The
other night in Winston he escorted
his date to her front door as the
clock struck 5:00 a. m. Just as he
launched his goodnight clinch, the
front door opened, an arm reached
forth and whisked her from his
grasp into the house. The door
slammed in his face. Quoth the
VOICE in his old Glee Club mono-
tone: “I can’t understand it”. And
what was this same dealer, our
nomination for Dealer of the week,
doing picking at his clothes last
week énd? (Note: THE BOOM
thought for once he’d get away with

this.)

PHI DELTA THETA

All is now festive gaiety and
unrestrained joy among the Phis in
these grand and glorious times in
which we are living, we are dwell-
ing. From the lofty portals of our
pewly splendored hall may be heard,
between chantings by O. E, Starnes,
fifty cultured male voices singing
in mellow chords, “Hail! Hail!
Sam’s car is here.” That is to say
that Sacred, Social Sam Tate has
at last received his long ordered
Buick convertible club coop. The
chapter has unanimously decided
to paint Phi Delta Theta in white
on the mobile and tour the nation
in a series of week-end jaunts.
Girls’ schools, major athletic events,
and fine bands will be emphasized
as points of interest.

The Phi Delt area for maneu-
vers last week end was, of course,
Raleigh. Lee Willingham enjoyed
very much spending those two days
with hisfraternity pin. Brother
Starnes returned to the ‘campus
boasting of a  bee-oo-tiful date.
Brothers McClean and Sutton, B.
M. O: C.s dated Salem girls.
Brother Oglesby also reports rous-
ing time.

Shelley Colson had a big campus
week end. He: chose to talk for
fifteen minutes over the telephone
to a Jacksonville belle rather than
make the Raleigh excursion. What
a.fine chick she must be!!!

Brother’ Morris Newell, new and
inexperienced in the Davidson area
of deployment because of his re-
cent transfer from Georgia Tech,
has asked some advice from an
old-timer, .operator extraordinaire
Potts Cameron. ‘Thus Potts” and
Morris are anticipating a big deal
at Salem in the near future.

PI KAPPA ALPHA
Things were rather quiet around
the Pika House here on the campus
this week end since most of the
brothers and ‘pledges were gone to

the State-Davidson game or other

points where their specific interest
lay. f

-Brother Hester and Pledge Shew-
mate must have found things rather
interesting around Pulaski. They
should have been anyway after hav-
ing to take up a collection on the
train to pay for the tickets.

Brother Jackson went to Salem
last week end and seems that he
is going back this week end too.
Says he’s about to be a pin-up
boy, what about it Page?
Brothers Wood and Sumner spent
a quiet night in Durham with two
nice Sigma Nu ‘boys from Carolina.
What kind of boys belong to the
Sigma Nu order anyway?

Brothers Smoak, McNair and
Dockery had a very nice time at
the Pika house at Carolina. What
was Brother Dockery doing at the
top of the stairs? . Brother Smoak,
along with someone else’s date,
seemed to think, whole hog or noth-
ing was the motto for the night.

Brother Rogers’ won’t admit to
anything that he ‘did so he must
have had a mighty big time. He
should have for there are’ some
mighty nice looking women. in
Kannapolis aren’t there Brother
Smoak ?

SIGMA ALPHA EPSILON

With the campus moving en
masse to Raleigh over the week
end toes and fingers were counted
on Monday morning to enforce a
quorum and list all casualties.
Brothers Harris, McGehee, J. Mc-
Alister, F. Little, Grimball, Ri-
chert, Powell, Allen, Port, B. Gam-
brell, Grosse, Hatch, and Pledges
Rodgers, Carson, Reinhardt, Bruce,
R. Little, V. McAlister, Vance and
Williamson showed upon the 20
yard line (also.at_roll-call) while
Brothers Pahl, Bethea, Anderton,
Bailey, Guy, Ashmore, Strickland,
Eskey, and Pledges Rhodes, White-
hurst, and M. Erwin took honors
on the field. Reports on the week
end as a-whole varied from sly
smiles to screams simulatin’ a
glimpse of Lena, which possibly
bears more truth than fiction for
some.

PHI GAMMA DELTA

“T’ye missed you, darling,” she
said as she raised her revolver
again. Brother French was all
shot after a week end starting with
the chapter’s first flush of the year
and ending at Chapel Hill with a
date in the crowd so spectacular
that Brother Patrick had to be re-
strained by force from ordering
orchids in hope of entertaining her
at Homecomings.

Among the trips made to the
State game were Brothers. Murdock
McKeithan, Richardson, Leighton
McKeithen, Fireplug Fairly, Snod-
grass, Archibald, and Moneyhan,
and Pledge Brothers Crowell, New-
ton, Strait, Blanks, Poag, and
Harris.

The Brothers and Pledges—of

and wide during the week end,
but of course most of them congre-
gated around Raleigh, Durham,
and Chapel Hill. Brothers Hunter
and Reid got lost from Brothers
Gaither and Bumbarger and had
to get back the best way they
could. Just how that was no one
seems to know. Brother Everett
