Physics Group Hears
Talk on Light Rays

Sigma Pi Sigma Honorary Phy-
sies Society held its regular meet:
ing Tuesday night, February 7, in
the Green Room of the College
Union. After a brief business mect-
ing in which several new members
were elected, Tommy Ratchford
presented a program on “Deflec-
tion of Light Rays by Gravity.”

Plans were also made for the
meeting February 28 which will be
open to the student body. At that
time Mr. Roy Palmer, a well-known
light engineer from Charlotte, will
speak on “The Physics of Light.”

Following this, the group, stimu-
lated by coffee and cinnamon
sticks, entered into an informal
discussion on the advantages of-
fered to an engineering student by
a liberal arts college.

“lt we ain’t got it, we can get it for you.”

“The Jungle” and “Out”’
Sign Identify Copeland’s

By CARTER DANIEL

Among the non-college po

pulation of the Davidson com-

munity, no one is so familiar to the students as William (Bill)
Creecy Copeland, Sr., proprietor of Copeland’s Store. Begin-
ning his eleventh year of operating his store here, Mr. Cope-

land has led an eventful and v

He was raised in Rocky °Mount,
North Carolina, and was graduated
from Davidson with an A. B. de-
gree in 1916. After teaching high
school for a few years, he attended
Columbia Seminary, receiving his
B. D. degree in 1924.

During the next twenty years
Mr. Copeland served as both a
teacher and a minister. He taught
English and Spanish at Washington
High School in Washington, North
Carolina, and math and physics at
Presbyterian Junior College. Dur-
ing World War II he tauzht naviga-
tion for the Army Air Force.

The list of Mr. Copeland’s honors
and activities when he was a Da-
vidson student is impressive. For
his original orations, which every
student was required to make, he
won the Phi Society's Declaimer’s
Medal as a sophomore, and in the
following year he earned the Jun-
ior “rep”, granting him the honor

which we were privileged to hear last Tuesday night in Cham-

bers Auditorium.

At the same time, our sincere
and exuberant enthusiasm at the
beginnings of cultural awareness
would be meaningless if we did
not adopt a critical attitude toward
the initial productions of such a
genesis. The North Carolina Little
Simphony performed here, it must
be said, an overly ambitious pro-
program.

The performers in question are,
strictly speaking, if not technical-
ly, amateurs—that is to say, not
only “non-professional” (in the
strict if not the literal sense), but
“music-lovers.” Conceiving of
these performers in the Jatter ca-
pacity, we can not criticize the in-
clusion of ‘the Mozart concerto in
their program, though later, as we
shall see, in the former capacity,
we shall have just cause to con-
demna and deplore this catastrophe.

We must not, however, confuse
ourselves as to the primary fune-
tion of the amateur, which is to
attend concerts or to collect (with
some measure of discrimination
and good taste, it is to be hoped)
phonograph records. His secondary
function is to perform, when called
upon to do so, that which he is
capable of performing, and that
which he is fond of performing.

He must, at the same time, be
able, and careful, to discern be-
tween the two. We sincerely hope
that the members of the North
Carolina Little Symphony are fond
of performing Mozart and Haydn;
we seriously doubt whether they
are capable of performing either.

A word must be said on the sub-
ject of Viviane Bertolami, the vio-
lin soloist of Franco-Italian par-
entage who undertook to perform
the Mozart Violin Concerto in E
Flat. Miss Bertolami is evidently
a good student. She has learned

her lessons well, plays with com-
petent assurance (almost), has a
beautiful face and an appealing

aluable life.

HERMAN’S HERD HAS
DONE MOST FOR THE
REVIVAL OF DANCING

The band which, according to
Metronome and Time, has done
more for bringing back dancing
than any other band, Woody Her-
man's Third Herd. will make its
first appearance on the Davidson
campus on Friday night, February
17.

‘The Ole Woodchopper,” as Her-
man is popularly known, will play
for both the formal and informal
dances during Midwinters and will
present a concert in Chambers
Auditorium at. three o'clock on
Saturday afternoon. Students will
be sure to hear his latest Capitol
relenses, “Muskrat Ramble,”
“Woodchoppers’s Mambo," and
“Mexican Hat Trick.” ,

Herman's band has just finished
successful engagements at.the Blue
Note in Chicago, the Paladium Ball-
room in Hollywood, and the Basin
Street in New York.

On a recent tour through Europe,
listeners from Oslo to Munich
claimed that this was the first
truly great. American band they
had heard. Davidson students are
hoping for a considerable improve-
ment over Art Mooney’s offerings
during the last Homecoming week-
end.

A swimming mect is scheduled
for Friday afternoon, and for those;
less athletically inclined there are’
the usual strolls around the. cam-
pus. After the dances, many of the
fraternities will
have informal gatherings. The
banks of the Catawba river have
‘also been reserved.

NOTICE

According to a late report,
over 96% of the populace of
Cornelius concerned with
Southern Bell lines have voted
for the proposed telephone ex-
change with Charlotte. Around
5% of the people had not been
contacted at this report.

New Rules Passed On
Non-Academic Courses

scribed at the base of the fountain demic curriculum of Davidson students have been released

from Dean Spencer’s office this week. Both of these regula-

armingly modest in conversation.
In fact, this writer was enchanted
to talk with her and to look at her. ;

She is not, however, up to a
Mozart concerto. Her playing was
mechanical and uninteresting —'
even a bit strained technically. It!
was more an exercise than a per-
formance. (Yet how could one per-
form with a great bear pawing:
one?) There was no soul in it,
and without soul there is no art.

We merely point this out, since
we would rather praise the pres-

ing was honest at least, which is
more than can be said of all per-
formers who momentarily invade
our local stronghold.

The conductor-director of the
orchestra, Benjamin Swalin, went
through his gyrations like a pi-
rouetting bear. He was tall enough
to have performed without a po-
dium, and wore very full, sweeping
tails.

This writer had not before been
acquainted with Mr. Satterfield’s
compositions; the brief folk-suite
played by the Little Symphony,
however, was the sort of thing
which he enjoys and eppreciates.
Satterfield knows his business and
is no amateur. Some soul (the soul
of art) shines through, and this is
much to sey.

Satterfield, however, took some-
thing of a beating last Tuesday

night. The Little Symphony's not

store as “The Jungle.”

He prides himself on the fact!

that, as he puts it, “I know what:
the boys need and cater to their,
needs.”

The Copelands have many ties
with the college. Mrs. Copeland
runs one of the focal boarding
houses. One of their daughters,‘
Henrietta, now married, attended
the college as a coed. Another
daughter, Nancy, works in the of.
fice of the College Union, and stilt,
another, Helen, was formerly sec-!
retary to the Director of Athletics. |

Their younger son, Donald, will
resume his studies here in Septem-
ber as a junior, after spending the
last two years with the Army Medi-
cal.Corps in Korea. The elder son,
W. C., Jr., is an engineer with the
Douglas missile plant in Charlotte.
Mary, the youngest daughter, lives
at home.

Mr. Copeland likes the town of
Davidson arid hopes to spend the
rest of his days here Though no
longer associated regularly with a

‘church, he supplies needy churches

and feels that he can help the
students by talking to them about
their problems.

Mr. Copeland says the Davidson
students represent the best yet in
gentlemanly conduct, and he is
grateful to them for their patron-
age.

So we salute Biil Creecy Cope-
land, friend to the students, to the
college, and to evcrybody in gen-
eral. .

3. A student incurring absences
beyond the limit of five may make
up these absences by attending a
; Physical Education class another
‘period, except that

a No more than 4 such absences
may be made up during any se-
mester, and '

b. No absences may be made up
in advance.

4. Students who on the last day
of classes have. an excess of 5
which have not been made up will
be required to take an additional
semester of Physical Education.

5. Any student who for any rea-
son incurs more than nine absences
during a given semester will be
required to take an additional se-
mester of Physical Education.
Such students will, however, con-
tinue to meet their regularly sched-
uled Physical Education classes.
Absences above the limit of 9 will
be reported to the Dean of Stu-

_dents and the student concerned

will be considered subject to dis-
ciplinery action unless the absen-
ces are caused by circumstances
beyond the student's control.

At its last meeting the Executive
Committee amended the rule re-
garding absences from non-aca-
demie exercises to insert the un-
derlined portion below:

111 B. Absence Regulations —
REGULATIONS FOR ALL STU-
DENTS 1955-56, p. 23.

“For exceeding the number of
absences in any required non-aca-
demic exercise, a student will be

sult in his restriction to the cam-
pus for a period of one month. Any
further absence from any non-aca-

demic exercise, whether or not it:

is above the limit allowed, will
make the student subject to sus-
pension from the college.”

Students are reminded that the
above regulation refers to absen-
ces in chapel and vespers, For the
information of the student body,
the limits of absences are quoted
below:

Freshmen and Sophomores 4
Juniors and Seniors 6

Juniors and Seniors 8

Asked to comment on the new
absence regulations, Dean Spencer
released the following statement:

“A good many students have
asked about the addition of a cam.
pus restriction to the penalty al-
ready in effect -for students who
overcut non-academic exercises
twice. The reason for the addition
is that there was apparently not a
sufficient intermediate penalty be-
tween the “probation” which
meant little to many students, and
the serious penalty of suspension.
I would like to point out two
things about this change:

1. Under the new system of phy-
sical education absences, physical
education is no longer included in
the “non-academic” exercises to
which this penalty applies; for the
purpose of absence regulations the
term “non-academic exercises" now
includes only chapel and vespers.

2. This penalty would go into ef-
fect only after a student has over-
cut twice — that is, after he has
exceeded the normal limit of ab-
sences in either chapel or Vespers
by two. I urge students, however,
to read the regulations fully so as

Must for 1000 Students

By JIM ARMISTEAD
Nearly two million dollars in additional funds will be
necessary to meet financial requirements for an increased
student body of 1,000, the College Committee on Population
Trends revealed in its report of February 7.

The figure is estimated as the:
minimum amount necessary to’
maintain present academic stan-
dards and makes no provision for’
the improvement of Davidson’s cur-
rent educational program.

At present the College js seek-
ing $1.5 million in endowment and
plant funds partly as a result. of;
the growth of Davidson College:

of academic work for the present
student body of about 860.
Expansion of the College to a
capacity of. 1,000 students would
‘demand un estimated $1,303,580 in
additional cndowment, and a fig-
ure approximating $524,000 for ad-
ditions to the College plant and

1941-42 the student body has added

of twenty-seven per cent. The:

asked the following questions. The
numerical results, as well as the
percentage results, are ‘given by
the side of each answer.

Would you be in favor of an in-
tersemester break if the days to be

do you like best.

It is evident that the vast ma- .
jority of students would like to
i have an intersemester break, but
there is no large-scale agreement

‘as to how the days should be made

up. Of all the possible plans, the
most favored one is.to make up the
days in the spring, at the end of
school.

Even to this plan, however, over
half the students who wanted an
intersemester break are in opposi-
tion. When the 25° who prefer
not to have a break are added to
this number, it is obvious that
those favoring this plan are defi-
nitely in the minority

The final decision on this matter
rests with the calendar committee
of the faculty. They, of course,
will consider all aspects of. the sit-
uation before reaching a definite
conclusion.

Student body opinion for in-
creased enrollment was based on
such reasons as: Davidson should
accept the challenge of the rising
admissions question to provide
more men a Christian education
of high calibre; we now have the
near adequate facilities for en-
larged numbers; we would not lose

; the essence and power of the “at-

mosphere” at Davidson with more
students: the proposed extent of
enlargement would not lower the
quality of our standards or grad-
uates, but it would offer variety
‘and depth to the student body.
Student opinion expressed for
retaining the present enrollment
fell generally into these categori-
cal comments: Davidson does not
have the present facilities to house,
teach, or adequately handle an en-
larged enrollment; an increased
student body would gradually re-
sult in deterioration of the bene-
fits and opportunities of a small
liberal arts college; increased en-
rollment would be a burden on the
faculty, an injustice to the student,
and an emphasis of quantity over
quality; our problem should be one
of enhancing the present system.

Mr. Ralph H. Morehead,
father of Dick Morehead, Edi-
tor of the Davidsonian, passed
away during the night at his
home in Huntington, West Vir-
ginia, after an extended illness.
The staff of the Davidsonian
and the college community
join in expressing their feel-
ings of deepest sympathy.
