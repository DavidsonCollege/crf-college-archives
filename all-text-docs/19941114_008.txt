Daring a parents’ forum on post-
Davidson opportunities, in the
pages of The Davidsonian, and in

the halls of Chambers, we have '

become aware of concerns about
Davidson’s grading and academic
rigor. A recurring theme is that
this rigor, reflected in our chal-
lenging curriculum and grading
standards, can have a negative im-
. pact on the future of our students.
Let us offer a few reflections
on these issues. Social scientists
have long discussed the phenom-
ena associated with a “pure public
good.” With a private good, like
an ice cream cone, one person’s
consumption of the good dimin-
ishes another’s ability to consume
it. In contrast, with'a pure public
good, like a lighthouse, one
person’s consumption of the good
does not diminish another person’s
consumption of the good.
Moreover, witha public good,
it is difficult to exclude “non-pay-
ers,” who then have an incentive to
avoid paying for the good. These
non-payers are called “‘free-riders.”
As aresult, with public goods there
is a recognizable need for inter-

Grades, standards, and public goods

Academic policy should reinforce the college’s rigor and
discourage those who might
be tempted as ‘“‘free-riders.”’

sure that all pay their fair share.
Davidson’s reputation for aca-
demic excellence is really a form
of public good. Each graduate
leaves the college with an ability to
enjoy the benefits of the college’s
reputation without, diminishing
another’s consumption of it; also,
we cannot exclude the “less aca-
demically serious” graduates from
enjoying the benefits of the
college’s reputation. While at
Davidson, students and faculty can
be subjectto the temptation to avoid
paying the full price of these de-
manding standards. What does all
this mean for academic policy?
Essentially, academic policy
should reinforce the college’s rigor
and discourage those who might
be tempted as “free-riders.”” Fortu-

that support our faculty’s desire
for high standards. In our review
of untenured faculty, the adminis-
tration and tenured departmental
colleagues consider rigor and stan-
dards in their evaluation of the
untenured. Unfortunately, how-
ever, faculty can be subject to pres-
sure to compromise on the issue of '
rigor. To the extent that enroll-
ments and student evaluations are
negatively affected by rigor, some
potential for an erosion of stan-
dards exists.

A central issue is whether en-
rollment and satisfaction are in-
creasingly driven more by the pros-
pect of good grades than by astimu-
lating and challenging experiertice.
With some justification, students
are concerned with their actual

too low a GPA will keep them
from their desired graduate admis-
sion or employment. From this
perspective, seeking a course that
has a lower grading standard is
rational and is consistent with the
“free-riding” hypothesis: “TI will
enjoy the college’s reputation for
rigor, but by seeking less rigorous
courses, I do not have to pay the
full price for the benefit.”

Please note we are not saying
that any one course at Davidson
College is very easy or is a pure
give-away. We are simply stating
the fact that figures released from
the Registrar’s office show that
there is significant variance in
GPA’s awarded by department, and
even greater variance in the GPA’s
acrossindividual faculty members.

students, we have seen students
increasingly influenced in their
choice of courses by the expected
grade in a course compared to the
work load.

Unfortunately, this trend
places faculty in the position of
assessing their grading standards
and course demands relative to oth-
ers at the college. Fortunately,
there is resistance to compromis-
ing standards; yet, the pressure for
such compromise exists. In con-
trast, were course enrollments
driven exclusively by the academic
merit of the course, faculty would
receive a different set of incen-
tives.

We have a few suggestions
for remedying this situation. First,
students should realize that pre-
serving the rigor of the college
contributes to their post-graduate
success. The letters of recommen-
dation written by our faculty for
our students invariably comment:

comfortable at Davidson that there

The inclusion principle

Here at Davidson we do not ex-
clude any student based on sex,
race, orcreed. That’s great (truly),
but we cannot rest on our laurels—
there is much to be done. We must
find all instances of exclusion at
Davidson and eliminate them.
- Exclusion is wrong, and it is up to
open-minded and moral people
such as us to put it in its place.
First, we exclude those who
are “academically challenged” so
we must lower our academic stan-
dards to include these people.
Come to think of it, some
people, in fact, many people (smart,
dumb, or indifferent) cannot af-
ford to experience Davidson. So,
let’s lower tuition to about six thou-
sand dollars a year (roughly the in-
state tuition at Carolina) so that we
can include these people.

Whadda ya say? We could do
without our high quality Commons
food (nutritious or not) and the
laundry service. We could then
convert Baker Sports Complex into
the new Town of Davidson YMCA.
Why should we exclude the town
from such wonderful facilities any-
way? Since we can no longer
afford its upkeep we will definitely
need the funds from each
townperson’s yearly membership.

By lowering the tuition we
may also say goodbye to our first-
rate professors. Bye y’all! Not to
say that professors are greedy, but
a first-rate professor deserves a
first-rate salary and a top-rate
school.

Davidson will cease being a
top-rate school, remember, when
we stop requiring a diploma for

admission. We do not want to
exclude the high school dropout,
you know.

As far as the leadership of the
college goes, who’s to say one
person is better than another in say

. the president’s chair? We
wouldn’t want to set any qualifica-
tions forthe job, because any quali-

fication would definitely exclude
someone. So anyone is fair game.
Heck, I could be a great president
and so could you! Why don’t we
each take turns? And since the
president’s positions don’t influ-
ence the school, anything we say
or do is just dandy.

“No morning classes!” we’ ll

decree. They exclude night people.
Oh, but many people cherish their
free afternoons and night classes
would definitely exclude morning
people. Oursolution? “Noclass at
all!” That’s fairenough. Although,
we will exclude those who came
here to get an education. Wait...
who let them in?
