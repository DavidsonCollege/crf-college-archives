Women's B-ball su

By Matt Pitzer

The women’s basketball team
lost its sixth consecutive game
Saturday night 74-60 to Tennes-
see-Chattanooga, leaving
Davidson just three regular season
games to pick upa conference win,
one of its preseason goals.

Saturday, the Wildcats were
down by just six points at the half,
but the Moccasins (12-11, 6-5
Southern Conference) pulled away
after the break. Carolyn Kirsch con-
tinued to play well for the ‘Cats (5-
17, 0-5), scoring 13 points and
grabbing 17 rebounds, the most by
any Davidson player this season.
Tonya Sharpe hit five of seven

a be

three-pointers on her way to throw-
ing in 17 points.

On Thursday in Belk Arena,
Georgia Southern dropped the
Wildcats, 87-61. The Eagles cur-
rently lead the conference witha 9-
1record. In that game, Sharpe again
had 17 points, while Erin Butcher
added 12 and Kristen Ferrucci 10.

One of coach John Filar’s few
goals for the season was to pick up
aconference win for the team in its
second year of existence. The Cats
have only the three games left todo
so, two of those on the road.

The two freshmen point
guards, Monica Winter and Eliza-
beth DuBose, have been playing

ers sixth loss

well. Against Georgia Southern,
the pair only turned the ball over
three times, improving on one of
Filar’s concerns about the team.

Davidson cut the Eagles’ lead
to five points with 13 minutes re-
maining in the game Thursday.
But Georgia Southern ran away
with the game with a 34-13 run to
close out the game.

The first attempt at that one
win, and the team’s final home
game, will come Wednesday at
home against Appalachian State,
one of the tougher teams in the
league. The Mountaineers topped
the Cats handily last mapenay in
Boone.

Cats continued from page 1

shots, but most of those stats came
early in the game.

“The fan support has been
great, especially the passion dis-
played by the students,” added
McKillop.

Fans traveled on Saturday as
well, seeing a tight game that
Davidson could just not pull off.
The Wildcats made more field
goals and got more rebounds, but
the Mountaineers made the right
kind of shots, dropping ten three-
pointers that proved too much.

In the first half, Brandon Wil-
liams showed everyone why he is

called “O-Zone,” electrifying the

Davidson crowd with two power- .

ful dunks, one on an alley-oop and
another ona breakaway. Atthe end
of the half, an App. St. guard nailed
a 25-footer at the buzzer to give the
Mountaineers a 49-48 lead. The
second half included several lead
changes that put the crowd through
an emotional roller coaster. Janko
Narat led the Cats with 23 points,
moving him into the eighth posi-
tion on the all-time scoring list.
With 13 seconds remaining
and down by three, Davidson had
the ball with a chance to tie the
game. The Cats got the ball to the
man they wanted, setting Narat at

the top of the key. He missed the
shot, but the rebound fell to Will-
iams, who got the ball back to
Narat once more, but the shot
missed, and Davidson’s winning
streak came to a close.

Freshman Mark Donnelly had
his best game of the year, coming
through big for the Wildcats, hit-
ting all four of his shots, including
three three-pointers for 11 points.
The Cats got few breaks from the
refs, as the Mountaineers were
whistled for only 14 fouls. At one
point in the second half, Davidson
had 9 fouls to Appalachian’s 1.

The next home game will be
tonight, February 21 at 7:00 p.m.

Swimming & diving finish season strongly

Swim continued from 14

fifth, respectively, in the 400
Freestyle Relay.

“As a senior, I thought it was .

a darn good way to go out and a
good start for a young team next
year...all the seniors were glad to

be a part of it,” said senior Dave
Martin. Added freshman Bo Craig,
“We got to compete against schools
of our own size, which really helped
us along.” In the final polls, the
Davidson women finished fifth
place with a total of 307.5 points;
the men, with 319.0 points, fin-

ished sixth. Martin echoed the

team's attitude: “It’s just the begin-

ning for next year.”

Davidson Swimming and
Diving clearly finished their sea-
son with a very strong effort, one
that foretells an even better season
in 1994-95.

and finishing tenth overall.

The last event of the day was
the 4x400 relay. Running with
three freshmen and a junior, the
relay team shaved seconds off the
existing record to better the mark
to 4:19. Lara Brukholder ran the
first position (63.1) and handed off
to Maria Whitehead (63.9).

“Fresh legs” Sallie Permar ran
the third leg (65.7) and handed off
to Mary Baxter (66.7). Ending the
indoor season with several broken
records and many personal bests is
only an indication of what the out-
door season holds for the track
team.
