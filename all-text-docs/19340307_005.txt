at the age of 87. Mr. Hoffman had
been in poor health for several years,
and was confined to his bed for the
last week of his life.

ment of Davidson College in 1862, and
remained here until 1864, when he en-
tered the Southern army. He was
commissioned a second lieutenant, and
was attached to Johnston’s army when
it surrendered to Sherman near High
Point in 1865.

He returned to Davidson in 1865 and
finished his education there in 1869,
receiving the A.B. degree. He went
to Arkansas in 1870, and taught school,
studying law at night. He was admit-
ted to the bar in 1873. He returned
to North Carolina, after an attack of
malaria fever, and practiced law in
Gastonia,

Giving up his law practice, he again
entered educational work, and served
for twelve years as county superintend-
ent of public instruction in Gaston
County. .

Commissioner for the past three years,
was elected president of the council.

It has been rumored around the po-
litical circles of the Piedmont section

the State Senate and from there to

Uhlman S. Alexander has recently
started a series of articles in the Meck-
lenburg Times on the various offices
of. the county government. One of
these articles in the series appeared
recently and was entitled, “Our Coun-
ty Government.” In this writing Mr

EI DOIN IEIOOO TOI

Alexander calls upon the people of
Mecklenburg County to select men to
run their government that are quali-
fied and fitted to do so. In determin-
ing their qualifications, the writer tells
of all the offices of the government
and what each office holder is respon-
sible to do. This series should prove

quite interesting and instructive.
