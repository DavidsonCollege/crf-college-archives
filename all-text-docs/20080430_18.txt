Seniors finish strong at SoCon

By Patrick MCARDLE
Sports Editor

The season-long success of the track and field teams contin-
ued this weekend at the SoCon Outdoor Track and Field
Championships on the campus of Western Carolina.

For the women's squad, Brenna Burns ’08 earned her second
SoCon individual title in her final college race. On Saturday,
Burns ran to a first-place finish in the 10,000 meters with a time
of 36:56.24. She followed this performance up with a victory in
the 5000 meters on Sunday with a blazing time of 17:40.14.

In another fantastic career finale, Mega! Atias "08 won the
3000-meter steeplechase on Saturday with a new school-record
time of 11:10.01. She followed up this victory with a third-place
finish in the 5000-meter run with a time of 18:02.57.

Both Burns and Atias earned double All-SoCon honors by
placing at least third in both of their events, and both runners
qualified for the NCAA regionals with their runs.

“I am absolutely thrilled with our performance at SoCons this
year,” coach Jen Straub said. “We scored the most points in our
program’s history, and that is an awesome accomplishment for
our girls. The team put together a great meet, and Brenna and
Megal were especially great.”

Kennesia Martin ’08 finished eighth in the triple jump with a
leap measuring 37 feet 8 3/4 inches (11.50 meters) to score
points for the Wildcats.

In the relays, the "Cats finished fourth in the 4x400 with a
time of 4:00.68 and fifth in the 4x 100 with a time of 51.50. With
all of these stellar performances, the team scored a program-
best 45 points.

On the men’s side, Beaux Jones ’08 and Will Funderburg ’09
continued to impress in the field events. Jones earned All-
SoCon honors with a toss of 174 feet 11 inches (53.31 meters)
in the javelin throw. This distance was enough to secure him
third-place in the event. Funderburg earned an All-SoCon rank-
ing of his own after he finished second in the discus throw on
Saturday with a throw of 151 feet 2 inches (46.09 meters).
Funderburg also finished fourth in the shot put with a throw of
48 feet 2 inches (14.68 meters).

The men also made their mark on the track. Kwame Som-

Brenna Burns ’08 won the individual title att the
SoCon Tournament by winning the 10000 and 5000

Pimpong ’09 finished fourth in the triple jump on Saturday with
a mark of 19 feet 6 1/4 inches (5.95 meters). Brad Troxell "08,
after qualifying for a spot in the finals, finished eighth in the 400
meters with a time of 51.21. Peter Bruton ’10 and Alex Hoyt ’09
also ran good races for the Wildcats. Bruton finished fourth in
the 1500 meters with a time of 4:02.99, and Hoyt placed 10th'in
the 5000 meters with a time of 15:29.79.

In the relays, the Wildcats finished third in the 4x100 with a
time of 43.99 and fourth in the 4x400 with a time of 3:24.26.
Som-Pimpong, Bryce Jones *11, Will Ames ’11 and Ethan Dunn
*11 earned All-SoCon recognition for the top-three finish in the
4x100.

With all the points totaled, the Wildcats collected 38 points to
come in fourth place at the tournament.

Croquet repeats as national champs

By PATRICK MCARDLE
Sports Editor

For the second straight year, Davidson’s croquet team brought
home championship hardware as winners of the USCA
Collegiate Championship in Golf Croquet held at the Merion
Cricket Club in Haverford, Pa. Douglas Clark-Brown ’09 and
David Orsbon ’09 beat out 14 other two-man teams to claim
their second title together in as many years.

Both Clark-Brown and Orsbon picked up competitive croquet
late in their lives, and they began playing with each other last
year. While last year’s win was unexpected, this year the duo
went in with a championship to defend. Fortunately, their expe-
rience allowed them to persevere against competition from
schools like Navy and William and Mary.

The pair played in the qualifying match on Saturday to deter-
mine Sunday’s seeding. With wins of 7-5, 7-3, 7-3 and 6-3 and
only one loss on the afternoon, the Wildcats tied for the highest
rank with Peter Hatfield and Chris Monahan of William and
Mary. The Wildcats won the tie-breaking coin toss to secure the
important top seed.

Sunday started with a match against David Cole and Conor
Hargis of the US Naval Academy. Building on their momentum
from Saturday, Clark-Brown and Orsbon defeated the sailors by
a score of 7-3.

Their semi-finals match-up also pitted them against a pair
from Navy, this time the duo of Lou Calabrese and Douglas
Clague. The teams had history with one another, since Davidson
beat this Navy squad in the finals of last year’s competition. On

the week was .667 after going 10-15 with four walks and five runs

scored in games against Duke and Appalachian State.

Saturday, they beat the pair 7-3 in the qualifying round. While
they struggled a bit more on Sunday, Davidson still continued its
domination in the matchup, winning the semi-final by a score of
7-5.

Meeting the other top-seeded team in the finals, Davidson
used last year’s experience to keep their intensity high. Although
Brown and Orsbon fell behind in the early going, they rallied to
win the match 7-6 in dramatic fashion.

Clark-Brown and Orsbon will have next year to add a third
title to their impressive repeat performance.

4/26 vs. Howard Win

Notes: With the win thé Wildcats finish with an 11-5 final record
season record. The 11 victories and .688 win percentage both set
new Davidson single-season records as they top the 1999 and
2006 seasons, which both saw they *Cats finish 9-7. Earlier in
the season, the team also made history with a school-record, six-
game winning streak.
