Calling all Greeks: Grab your spears and form a phalanx

Fraternities teach lifetime skills, love for the school

*ve received heat as a fraternity
man since pledging Kappa Alpha
in 1995, but I have taken little of
it seriously.

Pockets of Davidson independents
grumble, Greeks get bad national press,
and occasionally my little brother, a‘
sophomore in high school, gives me a
jab in the ribs and calls me “frat-dog.”

My father complained about the

dues until I became treasurer and then
president the next year, earning a cut in
my board bills in each case.

KA means a lot to me, and while I
recognize the flaws in the national fra-
ternity system, Patterson Court, and my
own KA Sigma chapter, I simulta-
neously praise what Davidson fraterni-
ties have given men since the 1880s.

I urge concerned Greeks — cur-
rent and former — from this campus to
consider our strengths in numbers, ac-
complishments, and ideals.

__ Are threats to abolish fraternities
at Davidson teal and immediate, and
are the accusations and consequent so-
lutions coming from the vocal few —

namely Scott Denham and Matthew
Hobbie — even valid? I seriously
doubt it.

Professor Kappa Alpha has taught
me much outside of the swinging doors
of Chambers.

The house registrar printed a par-
tial listing of our two advanced classes
just for this article.

And keep in mind that there are
also many 100 and 200 level offerings.

*FRA 314: Intermediate KA Ac-
counting: Year-long course.

Ceiling: 1. Independent Study.

Topics include basics of running
a small-business, health insurance is-
sues, salary negotiations; etc.

*FRA 499: The KA Presidency:
Year-long course. Ceiling: 1. Inde-
pendent Study.

Areas of special focus include
management, recruitment, public rela-
tions, etiquette, law, organization, fund
raising, ethics, argument, public speak-
ing — i.e. The Real World.

This semester’s focusis resilience
under blanket criticism from those who
think they can cleanse the campus with
the wave of a wand.

Which brings me conveniently
back on track.

A brother read Scott Denham’s
article in the Nov. 18 edition of the
Davidsonian out loud at dinner last
week, and I am glad he did.

We all thanked Denham for en-
lightening us to the fact that all KA’s
“carry a concrete stigma of racism and
anti-semitism for many non-Southern
professional recruiters” because we sud-
denly realized: with dread how we are
not conforming to KA standards.

I called an emergency meeting of
my officers. We are going to get to the
bottom of this; our exclusivity factor has
slipped.

(Freshmen, this goes out to you:
‘Please do not join our house yet. Your

A potential employer would be
about as right-headed not to hire me just
because of my national fraternity affili-
ation as he would be to hire me just
because Dean Rusk, John Belk, or Rob
Ukrop were Davidson KA’s too.

Unfortunately, the sorority issue
has been sewn to the hip of the raging
fraternity monster by an essayist work-
ing in the bowels of the Union, so I
suppose I am obligated to make my
final point in order to round things out.

Professor Randy Ingram states in

“Once you have a good laugh over the false assumptions
and burn-the-frats rhetoric, rinse off the morality mud
Denham likes to throw. Then stand up and prove them

wrong.”

files are currently being reviewed and
we reserve the right to exclude you if
your bloodlines don’t make the cut.)

In all seriousness, Dr. Denham’s
point is well taken.

Bigotry and violence are ugly things
with which to be: associated, but the
misdeeds of isolated KA’s at other
schools have about as much to do with
me and the current brothers of Sigma
chapter as Adolf Hitler has to do with a
man who speaks fluent German.

his Nov. 11 Op-Ed in the Davidsonian,
“Just the risk of changing the applicant
pool from which these students come
would be enough to confirm my oppo-
sition to sororities.”

He is addressing the claim some
women have made that they would not
have been interested in Davidson had
there been national sororities on cam-
pus.

Looking at this point from a new

* perspective, I would like to hear how

many Davidson men would have en-
rolled somewhere else had there not
been fraternities on this campus.

I would not have considered —
Davidson seriously, and many of the
50-plus percent of male students who.
belong to one of our national Greek
clubs echo my sentiment.

Are we bad, then? Are we part of
the “outside influence” Denham is so
paranoid about?

I grew up 20 miles from campus, I
volunteer at the admissions office, and
I already give to the annual fund — I
love this place.

So hark, all Greek men locking
your house doors against invading Tro-
jans who hope to “anchor some of the
houses thematically, perhaps: one kind
of sporty, another kind of artsy, another
kind of international.”

Look in the mirror, call home, and
visit your adviser during office hours.

Ask the questions: Am I morally
corrupt?

Am I not intelligent enough to
govern myself?

Once you have a good laugh over
the false assumptions and burn-the-frats
rhetoric, rinse off the morality mud
Denham likes to throw. Then stand up
and prove them wrong.

Davidson Greeks: Grab your
spears now, and form a phalanx.

They're after us.

The latest from Iraq: Events in Persian Gulf have a real impact
The difficult — yet rewarding life — as a military child

had a little problem last week
getting my articles in on time, or
should I say, at all. When I ex-
plained to my news editor that my
mind had been elsewhere, that I was
having a personal crisis, she looked at
me with concern and said not to worry.

A week later, my fears have been
assuaged only mildly. The situation in
Iraq has meant different things to dif-
ferent people. For a friend of mine here
at school, it means he might have trouble
getting a plane ticket home to Saudi
Arabia over Christmas. For me, it was
time to worry — I am a military brat. .

When people ask where I’m from,
I just smile, laugh, and ask whether
they'd prefer the short version or the
long version. My dinner table at home
is a generally a sequence of acronyms,
though I can only differentiate between
the PX and BX.

Icarry amilitary identification card
as religiously as my Cat card, and I love

the sound of planes taking off over the
house at night.

While the military life has almost
singularly controlled the course of my
life and character, there are times in life
I wish my father were anything but a
colonel in the Air Force.

In 1990 and 1991, when the Gulf
War took place, my father flew several
missions — enough, at least, to earn
him one of the medals that hang from
his fancy “mess dress.”

So when I began seeing headlines
last week about trouble in Iraq, my
stomach sank. All Icould imagine was
another round with Hussein, another
round of the mysterious and still-ques-
tioned Gulf War Syndrome, another
round of my father gone to the other
side of the world.

So I called my father.

“Dad,” I said, “Give me the SCOOP
on Iraq. Just a quick synopsis.’

Following the Gulf War in 1991,
a resolution was passed by the U.N.
coalition that required Iraq to allow
inspectors from the coalition to enter
and search the country at any time for
a buildup of weapons of mass destruc-
tion. While there have been minor
tensions in the years since, it was only

recently that Hussein expelled inspec-
tors from the country.

The United*States, after fruitless
efforts to reform the original coalition,
promised that if Iraq failed to comply
with the terms set forth in the resolution
and allow inspectors to reenter the coun-
try, it would enter militarily.

‘Since that announcement, the U.S.
has proceeded to build its forces in south-

shields. It is believed that Hussein and
the Iraqi government have in their pos-’
session enough Anthrax and various
other nuclear biological chemicals to
kill off the entire population of the world.
With all this in mind, and on my
mind for many days, it finally hit me
that when the time came, my father
would have to depart — not for a flight
there and back, but for several months,

“7 will always be proud that my father serves his country
as a member of the United States Armed Services. I will
always be proud that he is willing to give his life for his
country. And I pray daily that he will never have to.”

west Asia only slightly, as many troops
are already stationed in the area. The
process has been a bit of ‘“saber-rat-
tling,” as my father called it, more a
promise to use force than an outright
offensive against Iraq.

Hussein, who has been responsible
for the deaths of more than 10 million of
his own people, has begun to move
peasants into his palaces to act as human

probably over the holidays. Though I
have been spared many of the indigni-
ties of military life, such as having my
father out of the country for birthdays
and Christmases, or being forced to
move multiple times within a single
year, the thought of my 45-year-old
father in the middle of a desert planning
military strikes just does not suit my
fancy.

America has astrong military foun-
dation. We have the strategy, the weap-
ons, and the men should the time come
that we need to use them. The idea is
that they fight so we can continue to live
in a democracy.

I've always had different views
than my friends on the use of force in
other countries, usually because of my
father. Because I had a man sitting
there at the dinner table explaining why
we were there, why we needed to be
there, and why we would fight until we
reached our goal.

Because I had a man absent from
the dinner table putting in outrageous
hours at the office, flying missions at
2:00 a.m., learning how to inject him-
self six times simultaneously in the arm
if certain gases were released into the
air. Because I had a man in my family
who had to wear dog tags to make sure
he got home if he was ever killed in
combat.

I will always be proud that my
father serves his country as amember of
the United States Armed Services. |
will always be proud that he is willing to

_ give his life for his country.

And I pray daily that he will never
have to.
