From PhD. to professor: how faculty are hired

By NARESH NAGELLA AND
KIRSTEN RECKNAGEL
Assistant News Editors

Becoming a professor is no
easy feat.

As Dean of Academic Affairs
Robert Williams notes “The appli-
cants are clearly entering a buyer’s
market.” He says, “It is not un-
common to have more than a hun-
dred applicants for each position.”

After this step, resumes and
applications are evaluated and the
group is reduced to about 20 quali-
fied applicants.

Dean Williams says, “We hire
anew professor on the assumption
they are tenurable and that they
have or will receive the terminable
degree in their field. But, the em-
phasis is on excellence in teach-
ing.” Still, Dean Williams admits,
“Tt is hard to identify that great
spark of teaching.”

For that reason Davidson en-
sures students are involved in the
process. With Dean Williams, a
committee reduces the applicant
to a handful. Generally three ap-
plicants are invited to campus to
talk with students and actually
teach a class. Dean Williams
states, “It is critical for students to
be involved in a hiring choice.”

All majors in the department
meet with a prospective professor.

The candidates usually come

from Top 15 schools in their field
and ‘are often liberal arts college
graduates.

Most of the offers in the past
10 years have been accepted. Pro-
fessors are originally hired for a
two year contract and their perfor-
mance is reviewed at that time.

They are eligible for tenure
after six years of employment.

Dean Williams says, “We doa
lot of orientation with new profes-
sors. Department chairs are a key

point of contact with all new fac-
ulty.” That system may explain thé
relative uniformity in standards and
expectations of Davidson faculty.

Faculty also receive help in
moving and relocation expenses
before coming to the college.

They are provided with some
fringe benefits in terms of housing,
insurance, and tuition breaks for
their children to attend Davidson
for free or up to $12,912 per year
for another college.

By Laura ALLEN
Staff Writer

Six adventurous Davidson stu-
dents have recently been selected
to participate in the JET
program,through which they will:
spend a year in Japan teaching
English to Japanese students.

Seniors Samantha Hodges,
Mark McGuire, Katie McKelvie,
Lillian Rowe, Heddy Moolenaar,
and Bobby Ramsay, along with
Scott Lenhart ’95 will all be work-
ing as assistant language teachers
in Japanese schools, teaching stu-
dents whose ages range anywhere
from elementary to high school.

Mark McGuire says that al-
though they have not received their
specific assignments yet, he looks
forward to helping the students
learn not only the English language,
but also the American culture.

Samantha Hodges has long
been interested in participating in
this program. “My brother and his
friends went on this program,” she
says, “and so I had spoken to them
about it before I even came to
Davidson.” Even though Hodges

HABITAT UPDATE

Students who haven't been out to the Habitat site recently
might be surprised at the progress that has been made. The
complete frame is now up, and construction is still in full
gear. Dedicated students, faculty, staff, and community
members have been working hard in the Spring heat to
build the house for the Jettons, which is scheduled to be
finished next September. Weather has prevented Habitat
from completing the house this year, but the extension will
give the class of 2000 a chance to work on the house as
well. For information, call Catherine Turner at - 2460.

does not know any Japanese, she
says she is “pretty excited about
studying Japanese very intensely,”

Katie McKelvie says, “I want
to go somewhere rural and warm.
I’d like to teach younger kids En-
glish, basically by playing games
with them like Hangman.”

“T really want to learn Japa-
nese'and travel a lot, like to the
Great Wall of China at Christmas,”
says Heddy Moolenaar. She wants
to teach older kids and says that
she “would still play games with
them, and judge language con-
tests.”

“IT applied on a whim and
durning: the interview process I
became more and more excited at
this kind of an opportunity. I
didn’t know if I wanted to spend.a
year of my life that far away from
home but then I thought, it’s only a
year,” says Robert Ramsay. “They
were very mean in the interview.”

Some members of the group
will leave in late July, and some
will leave in August. Once they
arrive they will go through orien-
tation in Tokyo.

“Burly Bear Network” on DCTV

Brap D. CHAsE
Staff Writer

Davidson College Television,
cable channel 14, launched a new
program this week.

Known as the “Burly Bear-~

Network”, the show airs week-
days at noon and 10 p.m. It can
also be viewed on Saturday and
Sunday at noon.

The Burly Bear Network is a
national network that covers ap-

proximately 300 colleges and uni-
versities. Including the show “Half
Baked” which covers cooking, and
“Larry’s’ Lounge’, a music show
similar to MTV’s Rocumentaries.
John Blake, Manager of DC-
TV is optimistic about the addition

of Burly Bear Network:“This is the | mi

only programming that I know of
that is strictly aimed at college stu-
dents.”

Blake also explained that DC-
TV currently receives two hours of

programming a week from CMV,
College Music Videos, which is
alsosimilarto MTV programming,
with specific emphasis on college
students.

DC-TV plans to add is ty an
hour and half of its own n progra

ing for next'year!'*”

“We realize that ihe average
student doesn’t have a lot of time
to watch TV, that’s why we are
trying to get quality programming
for them.” Blake added.

Ties

From page 1

Wall, Jr. insists the debate was not
one sided. “There were strong ar-
guments on both sides of the coin,”
he says.

He emphasizes the impor-
tance that “Davidson college be a
church related institution, and the
chief officer be affiliated with the
Presbyterian church in order to
establish the foundation and the
core of the message we wish to
extend. The board establishes
policy and elects this chief execu-
tive officer.”

Ben Barker of Chapel Hill,
chairman of the trustee Ad-Hoc
Committee on Church Relations,
says the decision is in line with the
commitment to Presbyterian
Church (USA) that the trustees
made in February.

“From the outset, the board
not only wanted to reaffirm the
ties but strengthen them,” he says,
“so how do you express that sym-
bolically? I believe that these votes
reflect that. We really believe that
the trustees need to be Christians
at this point in our history.”

When asked how anon-Chris-
tian student should react to the
decision, Trustee Secretary Larry
Dagenhart notes that their frustra-
tion would be “understandable,”
but he would hope that they would
understand that “this is the way
that it is in the system of gover-

nance.”

He emphasizes that the deci-
sions of the trustees do not “put
down” other religious beliefs.

In The Charlotte Observer
Saturday, an article by Ken Garfield
on the trustee's decision claims that
“Davidson dug in its heels Friday
against secularization.”

However, Wall, Barker, and
Dagenhart say that this is not the
reasoning behind the decision.
Dagenhart claims that the trustees
recognize gradual secularization
of society and believe that Davidson
should retain its character.

All three, though, say that this
“4s not why” the decision was made.

Members of the Davidson
community have mixed viewpoints
on the decision.

Some see it as a reflection of
the purpose of the college, while
others see it as contradictory to the
diversity that it seeks.

While studying for a test, Jun-
iors Jay Hinton, Mary Morehead,
and Arun Thomas discuss the is-
sue.

Hinton feels the school “should
be able’to determine it's adminis-
tration.”

Morehead looks for a compro-
mise. “If you want to maintain di-
versity,” she says, “it would make
sense to have maybe a certain per-
centage be able to be non-Chris-
tian.”

dere Thomas sees logic
in the decision. “If the school wants
to keep a Christian reputation, it

would make sense that the trustees _
and the president uphold that.”

Study-breakers in the Union
seem to have more definite views.
Senior Rick Onkey, SGA Senior
Senator, says he thinks “‘it is im-
portant that the president is sup-
portive of a relationship [to the
church], but I don't think [he or
she] has to be Presbyterian to do.
that. For the same reason I think
[the trustee decision] is bad. There
are plenty of qualified alumnae
who are qualified to be trustees.”

Junior Katie Wells agrees. “It
would disturb me if they turned
someone away for his or her reli-
gious beliefs.”

Junior Greg Garrison, who
works with the Christian affiliated
organization Young Life and de-
scribes himself as a “self—pro-
claimed born again Christian” be-
lieves that the trustee decision was
not based on the right principles.

“Since many of Davidson's
decisions seem to be based more
on educational trends than Scrip-
ture or Biblical Christianity, it
seems problematic to me that we
require our trustees to be Chris-
tians,” he says. “However, as long
as Davidson is affiliated with the
church I do believe that the Presi-
dent should be a Christian since he
or she is a figurehead.”

Chaplain Rob Spach supports
the decision regarding the religion
department. “I felt like there was a
need for the change,” he says.
