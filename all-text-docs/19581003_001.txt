By CHARLES CHASTAIN
Davidsonian Associate Editor
In order to sample Trustee opinion concerning the

present problems of inadeq

uate dormitories and over-

crowded Vesper services, members of. the DAVIDSON-

members of the Board of

Trustees by telephone Monday afternoon. Their com-
ments and answers {o questions follow below.

replicd that it was “not entire.

Furthermore, he stated. “I'm
very much in favor of increas-
ing to one thousand as soon
as it’s feasible! They just got
la little overloaded this year":
As to future increases,
Or. Sparrow said that “I’m
in favor of taking one
thousand as soon as they
can take care of them, and
Vm in favor of taking more
than that as soon as they
can take care of them.”
One solution to the Vesper
