Grid Officiating Recalls Sour Memories

Coach Fagg often warns the
team about placing any part of
the blame for a loss upon the
officiating. After the Richmond

game last week I find that I can
not keep myself from
disobeying his wishes.

Our defensive backs were
clipped and our defensive line
was. held. Nevertheless,
Richmond mounted the sum
total of 10 big yards in penalties
for the entire day.

Davidson, on the other hand,
was handed 90 yards in
infractions. One fifteen yarder
thrown on a clean block erased
a 60 yard punt return that could
have turned the game into a
rout midway into the first
quarter.

In the fourth quarter
Richmond got a first down on
third and long deep in our
territory when the official
called Tommy Fleischer for a
penalty that was thrown out of
the rulebooks three years ago.

Representative of the way in
which the game was officiated
is the fact that the scoreboard
failed to cooperate with four
minutes left in the third

Rugby:

By MARK CONNORS
Staff Writer

Davidson rugby lives, despite
minimal recognition and finan-
cial instability.

Now in its fifth year of
existence, the Rugby Club is
still beating heads with
surrounding clubs and teams.

The Club was founded by
former student Rocky
Crosswhite to provide an outlet

for the athlete that was
‘looking for something
exciting”.

Because of its ‘‘club™ status.
the ruggers have faced both

problems and rewards. Not
being recognized as_ an
organized team sport, the

Rugby Club is open to anyone in

quarter. There was a blackout
at the stadium. The scoreboard
failed to work throughout the

rest of the game.
After the game, George
Weicher, one of our

linebackers, walked up to
Richmond fullback Barty
Smith. Placing his face inches
from Smith's nose George
politely but forthrightly
informed Smith that he wasn't
worth a damn.

Not noticing the power failure
Smith answered in rebuttal,

“Yeah? Well, look at the
scoreboard. Look at the
scoreboard."

Overhearing Smith's rebuttal
Mike Creasman said, “I'm
looking at the scoreboard, and |
don't see crap."

The whole game reminded
me of my last high school game.
I played eight-man football for
three years in Puerto Rico, and
on Thanksgiving 1968 we flew
with another team to St Thomas

.to play the Virgin Island All-

Stars.

This is a true story. At 8 a.m.
we arrived at San Juan
International Airport. We

Bruce Becker

boarded a plane and sat there
for a half an hour because the

plane didn't work. We
disembarked and prayerfully
boarded another plane.

We landed in St. Thomas at
Harry S. Truman Airport, the
sixth most dangerous in the
world. If you miss the runway
you land ina hill.

It was 45 minutes before
game time when the sugar cane
workers’ truck came to pick us
up. The 26 of us hopped on the
back and rode to the field.

The field was a muddy clay -

outfield in an old winter league
baseball field. There were

temporary stands erected, and
at the end of one end zone was a
stone wall. It looked good to us
because our home field hosted
bullfights on Sundays.

We started the game at 10
a.m. with mud oozing from
beneath our cleats and a cold
wind blowing through our wet
uniforms. We had two football
officials, a soccer referee and a
rugby ref.

In the first quarter I blocked a
punt when a purple uniformed
Chicken Hawk (that was their
team name) blocker
sidestepped me. Their punter
recovered for a 25-yard loss,

the Davidson College
community, including
professors and students and
whoever else is interested.

However. only being
recognized as a club, Davidson
Rugby, like many other minor
sports at Davidson, has
financial problems.

Henry Barber, club leader.
commented, *“‘We were given
some money last year for
jerseys and a ball, but this year
we haven't really asked for any
money.

“It would be nice if we could
get some money for traveling
expenses. It costs quite a bit to
go to some of the away games,
and it's hard to get enough guys
that are able to go,’ he added.

At present, a majority of the

Small Chess Club

Sponsors Tourney

By DAVID MELTON
Asst. Sports Editor

“We'll try to revive the chess
club after the Christmas
Holidays.’ That is the feeling
that chess club organizer and

president John Pascal hasabout
the present situation.

Pascal is rather disappointed
in the results of his experiment
so far. “‘The turn-out is very
poor.’ he said.

One of the club's projects is
faring rather well however.
There is a chess tournament
now in progress.

The tournament has 32
participants, and is set up into
eight groups of four players.

Each player plays the three
other players in his section.

The scoring is: one point for a
win, one-half point for a draw,
and no points for a loss.

The player who receives the
most points in each section
moves on to the semi-finals,

which consists of two groups of
four players.

“The winners of these two
sections will then play for the
championship."’ Pascal added.

Although much interest has
been shown in the tournament,
Pascal pointed out that
attendance at chess club
meetings is a totally different
story. “Right now. I don't have
the solution.’ he said.

Chess club meetings consist
of ‘‘discussion of different
facets of the game.”* continued
Pascal.

He then noted that such topics
as opening strategy and overall
strategy will be discussed.

Pascal explained that future
chess club meetings will be

announced in the
announcement sheet.
He feels that right now,

students won't have time to
come to the meetings. with
exams and term papers coming

up.

Club comes from the pockets of
the 25 or so members with the
collection of dues.

Most of the equipment the
team now has is_ personally
owned.

“Everything I use, I bought
myself,’ said Sam Upchurch,
two year veteran of the club.
“The school doesn't even give
us cleats for our shoes."

In spite of their lack of funds,
the club survives. Barber
commented, “‘Not too many
guys quit after they come out.
In fact, most of the guys seem to
like it. The only problem is
trying to get guys to show up for
practice."

The Club practices every
Tuesday and Thursday at 4 p.m.

“We need at least 20 to 30
people for a good practice,”
said Upchurch.

*‘We could use twice as many
people as we have now and we
would really like to see some
freshmen come out,”’ he said.

Barber expressed that the
major problem of getting
people out for the sport is the
misconception of the game.

“It really isn't that rough a
game. You get scrapes and
bruises, but that's true in
almost every sport.”’

“You don’t have to be a hard
corps jock to play rugby. It's
rough, but it's just like playing
a rough game of flickerball. The
refs discourage any real rough
stuff and nobody has ever been
hurt bad since I have been
playing.’ Upchurch added.

The most appealing portion of
the game itself is the traditional
beer party after the game,
according to team members.

Although only having one
victory this year in games,
Upchurch said, *‘we haven't lost
a party yet. We had a draw with
South Carolina after one game,
but besides that. we're
undefeated in rugby parties.

The Davidson Ruggers are 1-
5-0 in games this year, with the
only win coming in the second
game of a double header with
Hampden-Sydney. Davidson
came out on top, 16-4.

The club is looking forward to

their next game, starting at 2
p.m. Saturday, when they face
Duke.

“We're supposed to have a
game in Richmond
Thanksgiving weekend, but its
not definite,’’ Barber stated.

With the season almost over,
Barber and Upchurch are
looking towards the spring
season.

‘We hope a lot more guys
come out this spring. Our
schedule is a good one," said
Barber.

and the soccer ref gave them a
first down. We didn't get the
ball until one of the football
officials explained the rule to
the other three.

With my brother, Frank, at
quarterback we led at the half
39-0. The time was 12:30, and we
decided to control the ball in the
second half in order to be on
time for our plane flight back.

The officials had other plans.
The timekeeper stopped the
clock after every play
throughout the game because
he didn’t know better.

When the Chicken Hawks
started to come back the
officials gave them every
break. They had seven time
outs in the second half.

We got a 15-yard penalty and
never did find out what it was
for because we got five more
yards for asking.

With two minutes left on the
clock the game took a half hour
to finish. They ran three plays
and the clock moved five
seconds.

I couldn't figure it out. When
for the tenth time I asked how
much time was left I got a five
yard penalty for
unsportsmanlike conduct.

The refs gave up when we
intercepted in our end zone
what could have been the
winning touchdown pass.

The time was 3 p.m. The sun
had come out and baked the
mushy field hard. The
temperature had risen 15 or 20
degrees.

We rushed to the airport in
our uniforms. We crowded into
a men’s room, all 26 of us, and
cleaned off with no soap, a
carton of paper towels and
water. Anyway, we won 41-38.

The Davidson Wildcats didn't
win last weekend, but at least
we were allowed to shower after
the game. Nice of them wasn’t
it?
