Non-Perterred Risks

It is always with a bit of indignation that this writer
looks at insurance rates on automobile policies. It is rather
hard to admit that it is a valid generalization that puts all men
below age 25 in a higher rate bracket. It is even harder to
pay the difference. The hardest thing, however, is to refute
the statistics that have led to this generalization.

The truth that should be drawn from this situation is
not that insurance companies have something against the
college-age group. The truth that is rather stark is this: Auto-
mobile drivers below the age 25 have proven themselves
poor risks. Nation-wide and percentage-wise the age group
of which the Davidson student is a member has proved itself
immature in a life or death issue. In spite of the superiority of
youthful advantage in senses and reflexes we lead the way
in preparing the slaughter situations which destroy and wreck
more lives than any of the wars that we have known. It is
sober cause for thought.

There are many cars on this campus. Some will do bet
ter than 80 or 90 m.p.h: on a stretch. Some of the drivers take
pleasure in their so doing.

There are many boys on this campus who live a consider-
able distance from here. It is a matter of real concern to
them to break the record of last Christmas’ trip home.

Haste to get home to see family, flame-of-heart, or just
‘familiar landmarks is more than understandable. A desire
to shake the dust of Davidson from heel or bumper is also
understandable and natural. But when the waste that results
from haste may be a life . . . prudence ought to take the
better part of speed.

With no over-powering mass of statistics, and with no
morbid reminders of the past tragedies . . . let these lines
be a reminder to abide by the rules of common sense and
common safety as the Spring Holidays come nearer.

With no cliche clinchers . . . let me remind you that .. .
you, too, can bring down the number of obituaries .. . and
perhaps the price of automobile insurance.—D.H.M.

Old Custom of Buming Dorms

Revived In East Last Week

Many years ago, it was a custom of students at Davidson
to try to burn the dorms down. In the better Davidson of
today, it seems fitting that this tradition be buried.

Last week a small fire broke out on the first floor of
East Dormitory. Luckily a student in a neighboring room
extinguished the blaze that had been caused by a lighted
match or cigarette in a trash basket. Damage included the
burning of several suits of clothing and an eight foot area on
the floor.

Perhaps we would not have been so lucky if the fire had
been in Rumple or Georgia. We have been quite fortunate
here at Davidson with respect to fires, but there is no rule
preventing a catastrophe. The danger of fires jdue to careless-
ness can not be over emphasized. In a dormitory where so
many men are housed, tragedy and loss of life could be
brought about unintentionally by the mere act of tossing a
lighted match or cigarette into a waste basket or on the floor
or even smoking in bed.

It is a necessity that we be reminded often of the danger
of fires and asked to include in our smoking habits an ash
tray.

Faculty-Student Committee Report:

Purposes and Duties Outlined

The Faculty-Student Committee held its first discussion
at Chairman Beaty’s office in Chambers Thursday afternoon.
The functions of the Committee were outlined and it was
clearly stated this was to be a fact finding and recommenda-
tion group, airing student and faculty opinion on important
matters, and serving as a permanent “clearing house” for
faculty and students problems, A definite meeting time was
set for the second and fourth Tuesday of each month.

Also, it is hoped that forums on matters of current
interest can be conducted by the Committee. Other faculty
committees will meet with this Committee from time to time
to discuss issues on college activity in which they are familfar.
Recommendations from the Faculty-Student Committee will
be made in conjunction with other faculty committees and
presented to the Executive Committee for definite action.

During the discussion several current problems were
enumerated, but further investigation will take place this
spring. At the next meeting on March 31, the problem of co-
ordination of the college activities calendar will be considered.

Slime Pits West Of Duke
Provide High Adventures

Men living on the west end of
Duke tell us they look forward to
rain around here. After four years
of hearing nothing but gripes
about said precipitation, we won-
dered if these fellows were quite
sane. They mentioned something
to the effect that on rainy days
they were able to play their fav-
orite game.

Our curiosity got the better of
us and when premature April
showers began falling. this week,
we sauntered to the west exit of
the campus maze to watch men
come out for breakfast.

Being concerned with seeing
the occupants we did not real-
ize we were in a slime pit and
sank to our ankles some 10
feet from the building.

A voice came from withia the
building saying “That’s two points
against you.” Its owner soon
emerged and by an intricate series
of nimble jumps, skips, hops, and
slides he got to the road behind
the dorm without getting his trous-
ers muddy above the knee.

(t was then § looked closer
at the morass which presented
such en obstacle. Where once
had been something resem-
bling e flegstone path was a
healthy creek flowing down to
the road. The rest of the area
reminded us of the home of
Pogo, deep in Georgia's Okee-
fenoke Swamps.

Soon other men began to leave
the building. Their dexterity was
amazing. All seemed to pick dif-
ferent routes to the parking areas,
but even the most skillful was in
for a sizeable cleaning bill.

But were these unsung ecro-
bats complaining? Nay. Rath-

just a humdrum affair, Today

it was not the seme old dry
watk. Today it was high ad-
venture. Today the mark of «
man was determined by the

- number of mud marks on his
pants cuff.

We were in the process of con-
gratulating mother nature for pro-
viding this glee for them when we
saw something which made us sore
of heart. The brutal college had
recently spread some kind of
ersatz gravel over part of the area
to improve the standing for the
automobiles.

We would be the last to say
that automobiles did not de-
serve more consideration than
their drivers, but why did
they have to ruin the game of
the students? At least there
wat a little room left in which
the students could have their
fun.

But who knows what will be
the next step of the giant progress,
that shapeless leviathan? The ruth-
less men in office may decide that
a student is here not for play but
for work. If that happens they may
even direct the spreaders of gravel
to come again to this hallowed
playground.

Those who direct our college
may decide that the cost of that
much extra gravel and labor is
neglible and trod with unthinking
boots over the last vestige of dar-
ing open to students. Beware, men
of Duke.

seems to leap as if touched with

colleges all over the world. At D.C.
we have fraternity riots and later
student riots. Elsewhere there are
pantie raids. In Europe there are
demonstrations.

Though it’s tough on the
college wallet, perhaps it’s not
so bad after all. Frankly we
enjoy seeing Davidson men do
something heartily which is
not expressly the college bid-
ding. We show ourselves so
seldom around here.

Just the phenomenon of men
getting excited and heightening
the flow of blood in their veins
is an encouraging thitg around
this place which all too often has
a sickening resemblance to a
sheepfold.

be some hope. It won't hurt stolid

Voyage Across The Atlantic
Provides Thrills To Traveler

The perils of a columnist for
the Davidsonian are indeed fright-
ening: one poor soul whose column
regularly appears on this page,
for instance, has been accused of
such diverse crimes as installing
goats in his fellow students’ rooms
and setting telephone booths up-
side down. We who attempt to im-
prove the morals and manners of
our fellow Davidsonians by our
utterances on the editorial page
naturally are hurt and discouraged
by such unwarranted attacks on
the part of the rougher element.

We have not yet progressed
very far into the wilds of Europe,
and the dear reader may be im-
patient by this time to get started
on our weekly exploration of Eng-
lish pigeons and Parisian houses
of a certain type (this discreet
phrase was suggested by the edit-
or). Patience, lad, we are about
to embark!

There are very few of the na-
tions of Europe which have not
been mentioned, however briefly,
at least once in this column; this

time it may be worthwhile to dis-
cuss for a little while the trip
across the Atlantic. After all, even
if you travel on the S. S. United
States, it will take five days, and
that is fully as long a period of
time as most tourists spend in
apy but the largest cities of
Europe.

One distressing thing about sea
voyage is seasickness; even one-
hundred percent, red - blooded
Davidsonians are liable to fall vic-
tim to it. Dramomine tablets are
good, even if they do have a tend-
ency to leave you out cold for the
rest of the voyage. But seasickness
usually lasts only a couple of days,
anyway, and after that you can en-
joy yourself.

A more cheerful subject is the
fact that everything on shipboard
sells for ridiculously low prices:
there are no taxes or toriffs on the
high seas, and hence cigarettes
and liquor sell for about half what
we have to pay in the good old U.
S. A.

Girls on the tourist ships may

not be so abundant as they are on
student ships, and you may have
to hunt underneath the lifeboats
on some dark nights in order to
find them, but they can be found.

On the whole, what with dancing
and refreshments and movies, in
addition to the wimmen. {it’s not
a bad life at all. The tourist ships
generally have small libraries, fill-
ed with detective stories which
can be read in an affernoon, and
they are also equipped with swim-
ming pools, deck tennis, card
games, and such things, in abun-
dance — all of which {s sufficient
entertainment for an afternoon,
while most mornings will be oc-
cupied with sleeping and bicarb.
On the whole, I say, it’s not a bad
life.

Nevertheless, it’s always a great
thrill to see the ship approaching
land, to watch the process of get-
ting a mighty ocean liner docked,
and finally to step out on solid
earth once again, to meet the
thrills and perils of a vast, unex-
plored continent.

Debating Losing Importance As D.C. Activity:
Tau Kappa Alpha Seen To Revive Program

Here at Davidson, where so
much emphasis is put on so many
extra-curricular activities, foren-
sics have been pushed down the
ladder of importance. In the days
of Phi and Eu rule on this campus
debating was a major activity and
nearly all students took some part
in the forensic program; competi-|
tion was keen and our hallowed
halls rang with verbal expounding
and oratory. Now in the football,
basketball, baseball rush, debating
has been trampled and left by the
wayside.

This writer feels tnat many stu-
dents by not participating in the
Forensic program are missing
something which will help them,
individually to a tremendous de-
gree. What is debating and what
does it involve? Let us take a look
at a typical debator and trace
through the work which he does.

Early in the fall a national de-
bating topic is announced; this
year the subject is Fair Employ-
ment Practices. The debator im-
mediately begins studying the
question and the many approaches
which can be taken to it.-He reads
what authorities have said and are
saying about the question and then
decides whether he is pro or con the
issue. He and another who feels
the same way about the query be-
gin work on their case. After much
preparing and collection of facts
and quotations the two write their

if they have decided to support the
affirmative. If they have decided
to take the negative view point
on the problem, they prepare to
refute all possible plans and argu-
ments which an affirmative team
could produce.

The real challenge and excite-
ment comes in the debate proper.
You and your partner are then
pitted against an opposing team
and for an hour you debate, match-
ing point for point, quotation for
quotation, and logic with logic.

bate, he has received an inward
stimulation which is indescribable.
He has met with others on equal
grounds in a battle of minds and
words and he has risen to a new
height. Never are two debates
alike, for never are two people
created alike.

From the experience of debat-
ing one receives a great deal of
experience in expressing his
thoughts clearly and concisely. To-
day the knowledge of ones self is
imperative for success and all too
few are the opportunities which
we have to gain experience in this
field. Then there is that process
of assimilating knowledge, form-
ing one’s opinion, and preparing to
defend the chosen stand. No where
can one develop a greater sense
of self-assurance than in knowing
that perhaps some day when a
really vital question comes he can
rise and defend his views logically
and clearly. When debating part-
ners are pitted against two others,
equally as well prepared speakers
and, meeting on common ground,
you sharpen wits and match minds.

A chapter of Tau Kappa Alpha,
the national forensic fraternity is
being established on the Davidson
campus in hopes that dobating will
be seen in its true perspective
and that participating in the ever
