Palmer Christian To Appear
' In Initial Contest Of Series

Famous Organist Was Student
Of The Masters, Stroube
And Guilmant
Palmer Christian, who will present the
first concert of the College’s musical
program for this year, is known through-
out the United States and Canada as one
of the outstanding contemporary concert

organists.

Christian, a native of Kankakee, IIli-
nois, says that he was born without any-
thing except a musical sense. His
mother and father started him at the
piano early in life, being anxious to de-
velop in the best way possible his musi-
cal talent. By the time Christian was
twelve years old he was genuinely serious
and sincere about music, and started his
organ instruction.

A sister of Clarence Dickenson, living
in Kankakee, interested young Christian
in taking lessons from her brother in
Chicago. Progress was more rapid
then, so by fifteen the boy was able to
take his first professional post at St.
Paul’s Episcopal Church,
Simultanéously he was finishing a high
school education, and dabbling in amateur
music. He admits he was a good stu-
dent with high grades.

At eighteen, he obtained a better posi-
tion in Grace M.E. Church, Chicago, and
subsequently moved to Hyde Park Pres-
byterian, where he remained for three
and one-half years. During this time he
continued his work with Dickenson, He
is particularly grateful to this teacher for
his excellent foundation, influence, and
inspiration.

By 1909 Christian was ready for Euro-

pean study. There he tutored under
Stroube and Guilmant until the latter's.
death in 1911, He traveled extensively,
attended numerous concer s, and had the
usual good time. In exchange for the
use of the organ, he rehearsed the boys,
and acted as tenor soloist and assistant
organist in the American Episcopal
Church,
, Coming back to Chicago he took the
post at Kenwood Church where he re-
mained until 1918. At that time his
health failed him, and he was forced to
live a while in the Southwest recovering.
Then he became municipal organist in
Denver for two years. Getting back his
strength, he returned to Chicago for a
short time, and from there entered his
present position at Ann Arbor.

Progressive Changes In
College Rooms Noted

Many New Improvements Made
During Past Century

If one were to go back one hundred
years, he would find that life in a col-
lege dormitory was far different in 1834
from what it is in 1934,

For example, a typical student's room
in-a-dormitory. In this room whale oil
lamps and tallow candles furnished light
by which a student studied. The Bible,
a classical dictionary and some textbooks
composed a student’s library. A cast-
iron wood-burning stove furnished the
heat, a flat-iron with which the student
pressed his own clothes was just as im-
portant as the stove itself. The favorite
indoor sports were chess and checkers
played to the accompaniment of pipes
and chewing tobacco. The rooms were
small and usually contained only one
window, and were not as collegiately
decorated as they are now. &

“It, the dormitories of 1934, we find
larad airy rooms, well lighted and well
ventilated, and very collegiately deco-
rate@. The rooms are lighted by electricity
and/ heated by steam. The Bible can still

yw’ found as well as many textbooks. The

student has great libraries to which he
can go at any time for reference or re-
search work, and does not have to de-
pend on the few individual volumes that
a student of 1834 would have to have de-
pended on.

There is no such thing now as press-
ing one’s own clothes. In addition to
the necessities we find in a room, in this
day and time are usually found a radio
or a victrola or some kind of musical
instrument-that a student keeps for his
pleasure and entertainment. Pennants
and girls’ pictures bedeck the walls and
chiffoniers.

Chambers Under Arcs
Seen In Recent Digest

Pictorial Features Chambers

Last week in the Collegiate Digest,
there appeared a picture of Chambers
Building under the heading of “Campus
Beautiful”. The picture, which was
taken from the dormitory side under the
glare of the floodlights, showed the
large columns at the entrance of Cham-
bers.

The Collegiate Digest is an illustrated
magazine, which is issued throughout the
colleges of the nation. There have ap-
peared in this publication before, pic-
tures of football players and band lead-

ers of Davidson. This has and will add
greatly to the national publicity of
Davidson College and its recognized

beauty.

ROTC Juniors Procure
Snappy New Uniforms

The R. O. T. C. unit of Davidson Col-
lege announces the equipment of new
uniforms to the junior class of forty-
one members. The new uniforms going
to the advanced class consist of long
trousers, blouse, caps, and belts. They
are furnished by the government and
are tailored by the Jacob-Reed Company
of Philadelphia, Pa. The uniforms are
very attractive and make a distinction
between the officers of the junior and
senior class. The expense of the new
outfit is a great deal less than the uni-
forms used by the junior class of last
year. The senior class, this year, are
wearing the uniforms with leggings but
next year will have the same outfit of
the juniors this year.

“Was there ever so much enjoy-

Good Desks Are Given
All Dormitory Rooms

in

During the past few days, the in-
habitants of the various dormitories have
received new desks, and more are promis-
ed sometime soon. While these desks
are really old ones which have been reno-
vated, they are possessed of un-carved
tops, un-broken book-racks,
of gleaming varnish.

and coats

The supervisor of Dormitories hopes
that the students consider these desks as
a trust which they hold in the name of
future Davidsonians, and that they will
accordingly abstain from abusing them in
any selfish way. The name which is
preserved through the years on a desk-
top is, after all, not thereby inscribed
in Davidson's hall of fame. Let's keep
these desks new; it may be years before
new furniture again enters our halls.

The work on these desks is a continua-
tion of the work started by the college
during the summer.

The work is being done off the hill
and the repaired desks are being brought
by truck loads to replace the old ones
that are now in use.
