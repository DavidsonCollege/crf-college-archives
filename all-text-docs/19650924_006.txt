Secor Tells Of Russian Tour

By MIKE MAY
Davidsonian Feature Writer
Davidson's own ambassador

to the Kremlin, Dr. Philip B.
Secor, returned to give a full
report on his recent trip to Rus-
sia to a large audience at Open
End Wednesday night. After an
inaudible introduction by Paul
Simpson, Secor began with a
series of excellent slides.

Secor explained that he went
as a member of a tour organized
by the Cultural Exchange Corp.
This organization attempts to
“make efficacious the cultural
exchange agreement we have

goods—‘‘The. automobile is the
Guy/fjtem of eorisumed goods
riot Sh cansiderable abundance’’;

and the women—‘'These were
good-looking women." He was
distinctly not impressed by the
educational system because of
the very limited freedom of ex-
pression and thought that it al-
lows, “*I found nothing in So-
viet education that we would

’

with the USSR on a broader -

basis than the exchange of art-

_ ists, scientists and so on."’ The
group comprised people of va-
tious walks of life and political
persuasians. According to Secor,
a similar Russian group may
come to the United States in the
future.

Our hero spent most of his
time in Moscow and Leningrad.
In. Moscow he was impressed
by the apartment buildings—
“The most striking single im-
pression I took away from Mos-
cow was of apartment houses”:
the abundance of consumer

Strong. And they will continue
to. be so."' began President D.

want to emulate.”

Sécor mentioned that young
people in the Soviet Union very
much resent this highly regu-
lated society and they make no
secret of their feelings.

They were ‘‘almost rebellious
people. They clearly expressed
a fear of being wacthed, and
they were.”

Intrepid explorer that he is,
Secor "got to see things Ameri-
cans don't see" simply by walk-
ing in and explaining his situa-
tion. Officials were generally
quite helpful.

One of the forbidden places

was the Lenin Library where he
got a library cafd which, he
said, “looks just like a Com-
munist Party membership card.
a status symbol which I would
like very much to have.”
Secor touched on a wide va-
riety of additional subjects and
presented an unusual and fasci-
nating picture of the USSR.
This Open End was one of the
longest in living memory, ex-
tending well past midnight, and
the audience, which filled the
Morrison Room at first. dwin-
dled somewhat. For those who
could afford the time. however,
it was an evening well invested.

giving.

The magazine will replace
the old Scripts ‘n Pranks, and
according to Editor Charles
Vick will have a new format
and a new image.

The fall issue will be limited
to either 48 or 64 pages. Among
numerous entries will be a short
story by Samuel P. Adinaryan.
visiting Indian professor of psy-
chology last year; poetry by
professors: reviews of two John

Cheever novels: and poems and,

color paintings by Herb Jack-
son, Davidson junior abroad in
Germany.

In place of the slick paper of
previous years,. the magazine
will have six by nine-inch book
paper enclosed jn a standard
cover—a change Vick hopes will
produce: ‘‘a certain continuity
and respectability.”

Miscellany, the name of the
journal of the Elizabethan Pe.
riod, is used by Carleton Col-
‘lege as the title of its maga-
zine. By changing the name,
Vick hopes to end the persistent
confusion with the yearbook,
Quips and Cranks.

“We're trying to produce
something that the students
won't read and then throw
away.’ said Vick, “but some-
thing that they will save and
want to send to their parents.
We want the Miscellany to be-
come a good vehicle for publi-
cation. It would be good for the
student body.”

“The names of Washington
and Lincoln have beén replaced
by those of Martin Luther King
‘and James Farmer.’ asserted
Dr. George M. Docherty in his
vesper address Sunday - night.
“The Church in a Day

sial sermon dealt with the role
of the church in the present civil
rights movement.

In beginning his address. Rev.
Docherty stated that in the
Davidson student body there are
three separate groups, liberal
art majors who are pre-minis-

Presbyterians: ‘‘pre-profession-

the student little opportunity to

The second category contains
the Non-Affirming colleges,
which has no compulsory re-
ligious life. ‘It is generally se-
cular and leaves religion large-
ly uncultivated.”

“The third type is the Free

cludes in its curriculum religion

this is a day in which both
churchmen and non-churchmen
“are being driven by events to

essential to. know what ‘the

church means if it is to take

an. active role in the world to-
day.

In speaking of: the current

wave of social change, Rev.
Docherty referred to the three
revolutions this country has
seer. The first revolution,
against Great Britain, was typi-
fied by the Declaration of Inde-
pendence which stated the strug-
gle to be one for political, not
social, _ principles.

This ‘‘justice’’ came in the
form of the second revolution
—the Civil War. This war was

to really provide the Negro: wtih
a place of ‘respect and social
freedom in society.

The third and current revolu-
tion. in the opinion of Rev.
Docherty began not at Concord
or Ft. Sumter, but in Nashville
in 1955 ‘“‘by a little Negro lady
named Mama Rose Parks’ who
was too tired to step to the back
of the bus.

Leadership
School
Held Here

Davidson's chapter of Pi Kap-
pa Phi fraternity hosted its na-
tional leadership school here
during August. Speakers includ-
ed North Carolina Gov. Dan
Moor€, several alumni and na-
tional office staff members and
a founder of the fraternity.

The Pi Kapps are one of the
developers of this type of school
which is conducted biennially for
training its officers in chapter
operations.

The week opened with a recep-
tion at the fraternity’s national
office which has recently been
moved to Charlotte. Later that
evening President D. G. Martin
welcomed the delegates to Da-
vidson in an assembly in Hod-
son Hall. A week of classes fol-
lowed with sessions scheduled
from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m.

The course covered chapter
operations and problems from
bottom to top: finances, ritual,
Tush, pledge education, chapter
retreats, scholarship and alumni
relations. Most of the classes
were given by alumni brothers
or the staff of the national of-
fice.

Among its guests, the Pi Kapp
school had Simon Fogarty, the
fraternity’s only living founder.
Davidson’s Epsilon Chapter ini-
tiated Fogarty's son into Pi Kap-
pa Phi.

On the last day the Epsilon
‘Chapter tied for third place as
best chapter in the fraternity. A
