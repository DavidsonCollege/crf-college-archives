Other Davidson Men Assist in
Running Presbyterian
Orphanage

As Davidson College approaches its
hundredth anniversary, an institution
near Davidson and close to the hearts
of all Davidson men is celebrating its
fiftieth anniversary. he. Presbyterian
Orphans’ Home at Barium Springs, N.
C., has been operating for half a cen-

tury.

At the head of this great institution
is Joseph B. Johnston, 1901, vice-pres-
ident of the Alumni Asso-
ciation, and one of the most loyal sup-
porters that Davidson has. Mr. John-
ston .went to Barium Springs in 1922,
and since that time has done much to
make the orphanage one of the out-
standing institutions in the country.

Davidson

In a recent issue of the Charlotte
Observer was a complete story of the
home, of its beginning fifty years ago,
of its removal to Barium Springs, of
the growth of the place, and of the
management.

Mr. Johnston is ably assisted by
other Davidson alumni in the work he
is doing. Ernest Milton, formerly sec-
retary of the Davidson Alumni Asso-
ciation, is treasurer; Ralph McMillan,
2%, is coach; R. G. Calhoyn, ’29,
teaches and helps with the coaching.

With a deficit of about $100,000, the
orphanage is making a special appeal
to the Presbyterians of North Caro-
lina this year for financial aid. The
number of occupants of the home had
to be cut down this year to 303, some
60 than were present at the
orphanage last year.

The Davidson Band, under the di-

this year than ever before.

the program to a close.

The Wildcat spirit will be much in
evidence at the final pep meeting of
the year, to be held tonight in prep-
aration for the Wake Forest-Davidson
game.

Joe Johnston, popular Davidson
alumnus of Barium Springs, will give
the meeting a good send-off with a
speech at Shearer Hall, after which
a .torchlight parade will proceed
through the streets of Davidson and
across the campus.

The parade will end at Chambers
Building, ‘where more yells and
speeches will be given, and immediate-
ly afterward a shirt-tail parade will
lead the Wildcat followers to the bon-
fire at the freshman field.

Around the: blazing bonfire yells,
songs, and music by the band will hold

Dr. Brown Interviewed
On Monetary Question

“I think the most inflationary ingi-
dent of recent weeks is not the gold
buying plan of the government, but
the President’s promise in his talk on
October 22 that if farm prices could
not be raised in one way they would
be raised in another,” stated Dr. C. K.
Brown, '23, professor of economics, in
an interview on the subject of inflation.
“There seems to me to be
for thinking that this does
outright
that should be necessary,”
Dr. Brown.

“Whether the government has any
other plan to try before printing paper
money, I do not know, but the gold
buying plan now being used will prob-
ably not make prices rise to the de-
sired levels. However, other factors
may enter in and work toward that
end, making the printing of paper
money So far, the gov-
ernment seems to have failed to shake
the confidence of the bulk of the pub-
lic in its money.

no reason
not mean
money if

printing of paper

unnecessary.

“The government really has a two-
fold objective with regard to prices:
one is to raise the average prices back
to the 1926 level, the other is to remove
the disparity’ between farm prices and
industrial prices, which has existed for
a decade, but which has become great-
er since 1929,

“There is likely to be a conflict be-
tween these two objectives, and it will
be extremely difficult to attain both
of them.. The government is not very
clear as to which will take precedefice
in the event of such a conflict. Cer-
tainly the attainment of both‘of them
is a much more difficult task than the
mere raising of prices to the 1926 level
would be.

“Even if the 1926 level is achieved,
the economic distress of large sections
of our country, will not be relieved
unless these disparities have been re-
moved.

“However, by that time, there is
much danger that speculatiye forces
will have grown so strong as to make
it difficult to keep the price level from
rising far above the 1926 figure.

“The disparity between farm and
industrial prices goes back to questions
of our international commercial policy
in the 1920's. During those years our
farmers were forced to sell in a free
world market while the government
encouraged manufacturing enterprise
by protective tariffs. It is doubtful
that monetary manipulations alone can
restore the farmer to his former posi-
tion relative to industry.

“Regardless of the manipulations
through which mohey is put, the farm-
er is apparently destined to occupy a
very unfavorable position in our na-
tional economy unless the former com-
mercial policies are reversed.”

In summarizing, the main thought
might be said to be this:

The major difficulty in regard to our
monetary policy is not the lowness of
the price level, but the disparity be-
tween farm and industrial prices. This
difficulty was caused by our tariff pol-
icy of the 1920's, by which the Ameri-
can farmer was forced out of the world
market. The result was a rapid fall-
ing of farm prices. Dr. Brown stated

Recently there appeared an article
in the Concord Tribune praising the
loyalty of General William A. Smith.
Following is an excerpt: “That Gen-
cral William A. Smith, of Anson
County, has worn the Confederate gray
since the day he laid down arms at
Appomatox.”

’92-'08

It has been announced that Dr. Wal-
ter Lingle, 92, and Dr. Oren Moore,
‘08, have been chosen as members of
the executive committee of the Meck-
lenburg Civic League in Charlotte.
This body was created about six weeks
ago primarily for the purpose of pro-
moting good citizenship and law en-
forcement in the county.

Dr. F. M. Register, superintendent of
the Caswell Training School for De-

the lot of these pupils can be bright-
He suggests that members of
various organizations and clubs give
a small sum of five cents apiece and
at the etid of each month these pupils
are to be paid off. This system is
similar to the one used in the state
penitentiary and it gives the inmates
something to work for, thus providing

Sound Waves

Tonight George Burns will probably
go crazy again. In addition to trying
to cope with the usually mad antics
of his wife, Gracie Allen, he will have
to cross wits with “Chico” Marx of
the four Marx brothers, who is making
a special appearance on this broadcast.
Guy Lombardo, who furnishes the
music for this half-hour of entertain-
ment, has added another piano player.
This gives the orchestra two pianos for
the first time. Hugo D’Ippolito is his
name. Like ten of the other eleven
in the band, he comes from London,
Ontario. His father taught music to
Carmen and Liebert Lombardo, and,
strangely enough, he looks more like
the Lombardo brothers than they do
themselves.

Seymour Simons, composer of some
of the outstanding song hits of the past
decade, conducts his own orchestra as
the feature of a new series of half-
hour programs, which started over the
Columbia network last Saturday night.
The time is Saturday night from 8:30
to 9:00 o'clock. He has written such
pieces as “Honey,” “Tie a Little
String Around Your Finger,’ and
many others. Dorothy Page, ballad
singer, also will be heard on this new
program, which will originate in De-
troit.

Tomorrow at 10:15 a. m., a special
Thanksgiving program will be broad-
cast from Saint Paul’s Cathedral in

‘SUCCESSFUL COACHES

"Doc* NEWTON-Head CoacH §=& GENE McEVER- ASST. CoAcH

From all apparent indications, it
seems thaf’Davidson’s two coaches,
Williams “Doc” Newton and Gene
McEver, have proved eminently satis-
factory to the alumni of the college.
There has been nothing but praise for
the two mentors from former students
who have seen the team in action.

Newton and McEver have directed
the Wildcats through one of the most
successful seasons they have ever en-
joyed, winning five games so far, los-
ing only two, and getting a tie in an-
other. There seems a strong prob-
ability that the team will make it six
victories..tomorrow,..but whether the
game with Wake Forest is won or
lost, the coaches may be complimented
on the fine showing that their team
has made.

This Saturday there will be a special

Johnny Green of the Columbia Broad-

sical show.

ALUMNI PLEASED WITH
WORK OF TWO MENTORS

Mary, the Wildcats showed a power
and a skill that they have not demon-”.
strated in recent years. They reached
a climax against the Bulldog team
from South Carolina, and» Johnny
Mackorell and his fellow backs ran
wild for four touchdowns and one of
the largest margins of victory that
Davidson has ever been able to’ get
against The Citadel.

Behind’ beautiful blocking, Johnny
Mackorell, Davidson’s sure bet for all-
state, ran 85 yards against N. C. State
to score a touchdown. The Wolfpack
got one of their own, and the game
ended in a tie.

Against Duke and North Carolina,
the Davidson outfit did all and more
than was expected of them. Sports
writers all over the state were high in
their praise of the fighting spirit of the
Wildcats after these two losses.

.So, as alumni demand the scalp of
Chuck Collins at Carolina, ask that
Hunk Anderson be replaced at Notre
Dame, and mutter something about
the poor coaching at N. C. State, New-
ton and McEver can sit back and
heave a sigh of satisfaction at a job
well done, and can feel sure that, win
or lose, they have the backing of a
loyal alumni body.
