By STEVE SOUD
Two of the best baseball books published in re-
cent years are Roger Angell’s Late Innings and
Thomas Boswell’s How Life Imitates the World
Series. As the school year winds down and many of
you head to: the ballyards of Atlanta, Baltimore,
Anaheim, Philadelphia, or even your own living
room, I leave you with quotes by baseball greats
(from the above books) to accompany you through
the many games of summer.
I¢’s meant to be fun, you know.

—Bill Veeck
This ain’t a football game. We do this every day.
—Earl Weaver

The main idea is to win.
—John McGraw

Of all our games, baseball most tries the nerves
and composure of its players.
—Roger Angell
I represent both the underdog and the overdog in
our society.
—Reggie Jackson
I don’t think I would do as well in American
baseball.
~Sadaharu Oh
Baseball is pitching, three-run homers, and fun-
damental.
—Earl Weaver

HERE ARE THE FACTS

What is a baseball fundamental? If's any baseball
act that is so simple that the man in the stands thinks,
“I could do that. Why can't those big-leaguers?”

~—Ken Singleton
of the Orioles

I can sum up managing in one sentence. Every-
body knows all the strategies. Nothing's changed ina
hundred years. A manager’s job is to select the best
players for what he wants done.

~Earl Weaver

The only thing Weaver knows about a curveball is

that he couldn’t hit one.

—Jim Palmer

Sure, there are guys who will “fix” a bat for you.

When it comes back it’s like a Mafia hit gun. . . no
serial numbers.

—Craig Nettles

When Williams got a hit, he gave everybody a
lecture on how he did it. When George gets a hit, he
just days, “Gimme another one.” Williams was cold-
blooded. Scientific. George is hot-blooded.

~Hal McRae
comparing Ted Williams and George Brett

Your arm is your best friend, but you’ve got to
treat it like it was your worst enemy. I swear, it'll get
you if itcan. |

From the Locker Room: Baseball Quotes

The fans sitting up there are helpless. They can‘t
pick upa bat and come down and do something. Their
only involvement is in how well you do. If you strike
out or mess up out there, they feel they’ ve done some-
thing wrong. You're all they’ ve got. The professional
athlete knows there's always another game or another
year coming up. If he loses, he swallows the bitter pill
and comes back. I€s much harder for the fans.

—Willie McCovey

Nobody likes to take down a monument and re-
place it with a K- Mart, but sometimes it has to be
done.

—Joe Altobelli
Manager of the SF Giants
on benching Willie McCovey

He seems to have an obligation to hit.

—Lou Brock
on Pete Rose

Baseball’s true secret is that, for those who ap-
preciate and value it, it has no secrets.
—-Tom Boswell
You can’t be afraid to stand naked before the
crowd, because no one can ever master the game of
baseball or conquer it. You can only challenge it.
—Lou Brock
It ain’t over ‘til it's over.
~Yogi Berra
