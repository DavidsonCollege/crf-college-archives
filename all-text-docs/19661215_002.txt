Who Gets Priority

One of the goals of the Blue Sky
Committee is that of reducing faculty
teaching loads to nine hours, from the
fairly standard 12 hours now prevail-
ing here. The reduced load is virtually
being forced on the college by the
interest of improved teaching, as well
as competition for teachers from other
colleges.

Admittedly, some of the faculty
load can be reduced by reducing grad-
uation requirements. But the fact re-
mains that a certain variety of courses
must still be offered.

And doubtless some increase in the
size of the faculty will be made.

But reducing faculty load by 25
per cent is a drastic step and cannot
be remedied by such makeshift mea-
sures as mentioned above. It will be
necessary for the college to make a
financial commitment to insure the
efficacy of the Blue Sky Committee’s
work.

Indeed. even the 12-1 student-fac-
ulty ratio that the college now boasts
has little relevance, to most students.

Very rarely is a student enrolled in
such a small class, unless it should be
either one of ‘the more unpopular or
else esoteric courses.

In departments where small classes
are most desirable, articularly those
of the humanities, classes of 50 or 60
are not unusual. Professors have little
choice but to structure their classes
on the lecture format when faced with
such a situation.

The relative abundance of funds
for such a commitment is one we are
in no position to discuss, since even
the faculty is given little insight into
specific uses of funds. ;

But there is obviously money avail-
able for purposes which the adminis-
tration deems necessary, aS evidenced
by the commitment this week of the
president to employ additional securi-
ty officers for the specific purpose of
enforcing the college’s ban on student
drinking.

We would suggest money be spent
on first things first. But then, what
does come first?

A Case For Early Exams

Last week, as we pointed in these
columns to steps Hollins College 1s
taking in implementing a thorough
curriculum revision, there appeared a
short news story to the effect that pre-
Christmas exams had slight chance of
being implemented here. The two ap-
pear at first glance unrelated, but one
particular (and very integral part) of
the Hollins changes concerns this very
aspect. For. a midyear at Hollins,
students take a four-week independent
study period, which may not even take
place on the campus.

The primary reason given by the
faculty’s Academic Scheduling Com-
mittee was an awkwardness in sched-
uling which would be left by the “ex:
tra month” after first semester exams.
Certainly there is nothing new about
the idea of early exams — a number
of other schools in the area have suc-
cessfully hurdled the barriers inher-
ent in such a problem.

But the beauty of the situation is
that not only would the desired early
exams be instituted, but it would offer
an opportunity for putting in a valua-
ble academic reform, in the form of
the new independent study period.

Paul Denise. a New England socio-
logist, writing in the Spring 1955
Issue, points to the need for more
communications between the educa-
tionally advantaged and the world
around them.

“Students must be helped to trans-
cend the orderly, monastic detach-
ment of the university and its com-
forting conviction that its members
do not directly share the problems of
the world outside the institution,” he
says...

He goes on to point out that stu-
dents, in so doing, could combine ele-

ments of the curriculum with the ex-
tra-curricular, to form what he calls
the “para-curricular”’: “as experiences
wherein the interdependence of learn-
ing and of living are recognized and
are utilized to enhance both learning
and living, to make both more vital.”

Such an attitude can obviously be
incorporated into the regular school
year, as evidenced by the STEP pro-
gram, but academic pressures often
make the desired amount of involve-
ment difficulf or impossible. A four-
week period devoted exclusively to
such para-curricular activity could
well serve to broaden the outlook of
the Davidson student, who may possi-
bly be even more limited in his out-
Jook than the typical undergraduate.

Keep It Moving

A handy rule of thumb at Davidson
is that if there’s a receptacle avail-
able, the buck will be passed to it.
Such was the disposition of the Aca-
demic Scheduling Committee's inquiry
into the possibility of. pre-Christmas
exams.

In turning the matter over to the
Blue Sky Committee, the regular fac-
ulty committee may be setting a bad
precedent in refusing to take action.

Despite predictions that the Blue
Sky Committee will have some pro-
posals ready for faculty consideration
by next fall, it will probably be two
years before substantial changes are
made.

For every proposed change to be
referred to the curriculum revision
committee would not only greatly
overload its members, it would cause
two years of virtual stagnation.

Role For The Future

Two separate items crossing our
desk this week pointed to the hope as
well as the challenge facing the small
private liberal arts college.

In a routine announcement that
Davidson ranks third in the nation in
percentage of graduates receiving
Danforth Fellowships, the fact
emerged that: the first 10 schools in
rankings were private liberal arts col-
leges with enrollments of less than
1,500. '

And the top 25 schools are all pri-
vate schools.

But two articles in the current
Saturday Review indicate that all is
not peaches and cream with the liberal
arts college. In a review of a book by
Earl J. McGrath, Paul Woodring points
to the cutthroat competition for fed-
eral grants for research and building
expansion. The prestige of the grad-
vate faculties draws eager freshmen
who are subsequently disillusioned
by indifference to undergraduate

needs.

“McGrath believes that the best
chance for survival of the smaller in-
dependent and church-related colleges
lies in doing what they can do best:
providing a common core of intellec-
tual experience,” Woodring says.

But even this may prove more dif-
ficult than it sounds. A separate arti-
cle in the same issue’ points to the
drawbacks of teaching undergrad-
uates. Apart from the vast amounts
of sheer drudgery, says Andrew
Hacker, associate professor of govern-
ment at Cornell and author of the
article, there are more serious dis-
advantages. .

He points to the lack of real intel-

lectual drive in most undergraduates,
who are more interested in situating
themselves in ‘“upper-middle-class
lives, neighborhoods and careers.”
Hacker sees little hope for drawing
outstanding teaching at the under-
graduate level, when the more satis-
fying work with highly-motivated
graduate students calls.

But the Danforth figures prove that
there is a role for the small college
which is willing to acknowledge its
role in the intellectual community and
to stress the stimulation of a genuine
educational experience.

Davidson’s record of sending over
70 per cent of its alumni to graduate
school is somewhat misleading, be-
cause of the high percentage that en-
ter professional schools, such as law
and medical school.

Despite Davidson's selectivity in
choosing its students, there exists this
danger of middle-class orientation.
But the Danforth figures should pro-
vide encouragement for Davidson as
a primarily intellectual, rather than
pre-professional, institution.

Now It's Known

An editor, though it be painful to
say so, is no more entitled than any-
one else to have his voice heeded; he
has no inside track to wisdom.

About all he can claim is that his
major occupation is following the sad
news of the world, and he may there-
fore be more familiar than most peo-
ple with what goes on.

GOP Conservative Wing

Is Real Election Winner

Dear Editor:

Numerous articles have ap-
peared recently in the public
and collegiate press advising
the Republican Party, in ef-
fect, to abandon its principles
and to adopt those recently
propounded by the National
Democrat Party and the Amer-
icans for Democratic Action.

This advice rests upon the
assumption of two premises:
(1) that the victors in the late
election were members ‘of the
so-called moderate wing of the
Republican Party, that of
Rockefeller, Romney, and
Brooke. who had rejected the
philosophy held by Senator
Goldwater; and (2) that the
“Goldwater ideology” is in
some way alien to the tradi-
tional principles and policies
of the Republican Party.

In this past election, I
should like to note, the greal-
est victories were not won by
Republican moderates but bv
Republican conservatives 0°
the Goldwater-Nixon Reagan
wing. The largest marg:n se
cured by any candda* ths
year was that of Governcr:
elect Reagan, while the larg
est percentage marg@n was
that of Governor Rhodes =f
Ohio, a conservative by most
standards.

In the Senate races among
the large states. Senator Tow-
er won re-election by the larg
est margin of any large state
Republican, the slightly small-
er margin of Senator Griffin
of Michigan being next larg-
est. Of Republican governors
elected or re-elected this year.
nine may be considered mod-
erates, while 15 would hold
themselves conservatives.

These inappropriate advisors
further point to the coattails
of Governor Romney, in re-
turning the Michigan’ Repub-
lican Party almost to its pre-
1964 status. They, however,
fail to mention the coattails of
Governors Rhodes, Reagan.
Levander, and Williams, who,
in several cases greatly im-
proved upon the pre-1964 sta-
tus in their respective states.
as did also Senators Curtis.
Miller and Tower.

The second premise suggest-
ed is far less valid. The philo-
sophy of Senator Goldwater.
as expressed in his votes in
the Congress, is far more in
line with traditional Republi-
can beliefs than those of Sena-
tors Javits, Kuchel, or Scott.

The policies sponsored and
supported by Messers. Javits,
Kuchel, Romney. Rockefeller,
of New York, Brooke. and
Hatfield — e. g., the extension
of Medicare, Vietnam with-
drawal, Rent Subsidy, Repeal
of 14(b). Open Housing — are
viewed with horror by the
great majority of both Repub-
licans and voters.

These men have served to
undermine the Republican
position in the Congress and
in the press; they have sup-
plied necessary votes to in-
sure, in some cases, passage
of such laws: they have urged
that the Republican Party re-

make itself in the image of
the A. D. A.. whose support in
elections they generally en-
joy; they demand the support
of conservative Republicans
at elections, yet consistently
refuse to support Republican
conservatives when nominated
for public office.

I should, in closing, like to
inquire as to the reasons for
which the Republican Party
is lately so beseiged with such
a multitude of advisors so
solicitous of the well being of
our. party.

Such advisors, not excluding
Mr. Seamans, a member of the
Young Democrats Club here
and an ardent and unrepentant
supporter of Lyndon Johnson,
his principles and his pro-
grams, in 1964, would have us
nominate, and, presumably,
‘elect, men who would continue
rather than correct the errors
of the Great Society; who
would preserve the failing and
faltaces of contemporary
“Niberalism” rather than pro
vide the necessary construc-
tive alternatives to govern-
ment actions, which these
times require: who would re-
peat again. the tired cliches
of the welfare state which
have proven themselves in-
capable of solving the prob-
lems of modern society.

The Republican Party, to
secure victory in 1968, must
present itself to the American
people as the vehicle for the
rejection of Lyndon B. John-
son and the Great Society.
nominating on all levels can-
didates willing and able to
offer sufficient measures for
the problems of our age.

Fraternities Still
Valuable Tradition

Dear Editor:
The “cold, cruel world”
which swaliowed up Buck

Lawrimore ‘66 has also in-
gested other, less palatable or-
ganisms of the Davidson grad-
uate variety such as myself.
who were afflicted with the
“awful sickness’ known in
the vernacular as ‘‘fraternity-
itis.”*

The thing that puzzles me is
that, though I must have suf-
fered immensely and exuded
all manner of malodorous foul-
ness, symptomatic of my viti-
ated state, I was never cogni-
zant of my illness. In fact, I
even enjoyed fraternity life
and the many adventures I
shared with my “sick" com-
patriots.

But not being possessed of
the time, inclination, or artic-
ulate quality to adequately
present an apologetic concern-
ing fraternities at Davidson,
I merely make reference to
the obvious — that something
like 75. per cent of the student
body sees the necessity for
their existence.

The remainder of the college
population, be they gnomes,
lizards, trolls, superminds,

idealists, loners, or just plain
different, will doubtless ac-
knowledge that fraternities.
even with their multitudinous
limitations, have enough mer-
it to warrant continuance on
the campus.

The purpose of this letter is
not to personally attack Law-
rimore but to question the ef-
ficacy of his logic. His whole
spiel seems nothing more than
a rambling tirade against prej-
udice, a coadunation of non
sequiturs, which ends with a
vague indictment of fraterni-
ties as the progenitor of all
such hypocrisy. discrimination,
and feelings of superiority.

Traits such as these are no
more engendered by fraternal
life than they would be by life
in an “eating club” and this,
offered as a possible solution
to Davidson's ‘‘problem.”
seems more ludicrous than the
complete dissolution of frater-
nities.

Maybe Buck’s motives are
good, in that he would like to
see everyone happy with the
fraternity situation at David-
son, but as some sagacious in-
dividual of yore once pointed
out, “you can't have your cake
and eat it too.”

So Jet's leave well enough
alone: fraternities are a Da-
vidson tradition, just like egg
salads at Mary’s, tall-boys at
Hattie’s, and the skin-flicks at
Boyle's.

Untidy Coiffure
Banishes Usher

Dear Editor:

At last week's basketball
game with Furman, I was
witness to yet another exam-
ple of the small mindedness
of the administration of our
big time athletic department.

Roger Ward, an English-
Richardson Scholar, was work-
ing as an usher in Johnston
gym: pay rate, 80 cents an
hour.

Midway through the [resh-
man game, Dr. Tom Scott or-
dered Mr. Ward to usher only
in the seclusion of the bal-
cony.

It seems that Dr. Scott
thought Mr. Ward’s longer
than average hair would be
bad for old D. C.’s image.

Nearly all. the spectators at
Tuesday night's game were
students, faculty or local ath-
letic supporters. Surely these
people know of Davidson's out-
standing opportunity in having
Richardson Scholars in our
community.

And most people are aware
that all nations do not have
exactly the same habits of
hair wear as Davidson, N. C.

Davidson's athletic program
is growing out of its smaliness
into greatness, perhaps. Hope-
fully the men who rule this
growing empire will let their
minds grow a little also.

And

Fools’ Faces sf:
For You Other Wise Men

No matter what the Christmas season may
signify to each of us individually, most of us, I think,
have some story or happening which catches the
essence of the Christmas spirit for us and brings a
private joy — frequently difficult to communicate to
others — into our heart. Somehow new light and
truth come to us continually through the old symbols.

I happen to have just such a story, and I want
to share it with you tonight. I cannot be sure that it
will “turn you on” as it does me, but I can hope that
it will. The full version of the story is a small book
entitled The Story of the Other Wise Man by Henry
Van Dvke and is available in paperback. 1 urge you
to read it if you have a chance; the abridged version
which I am presenting is a poor substitute for the
original.

“yOU KNOW THE STORY of the Three Wise
Men of the East, and huw they traveled from far
away to offer their gifts at the manger-cradle in
Bethlehem. But have you ever heard the story of the
Other Wise Man, who also saw the star in its rising,
and set out to follow it, yet did not arrive with his
brethren in the presence of the young child Jesus?”

The name of this fourth pilgrim was Artaban. a
Parthian nobleman and Magi or priest of Zoroaster.
He had agreed to meet his three companions among
the Magi—Casper, Melchoir and Balthazar—at a
temple in Babylonia within 10 days after the expect-
ed star out of Jacob shone again.

From the temple they would set out together
for Jerusalem to see and worship the promised one
who would be born King of Israel. Now Arbatan had
sold his house and his possessions and had bought
three great jewels—a sapphire, a ruby and a pearl
to carry as a tribute to the King, and he awaited
only the sign in the sky. And at the appointed time,
the two great planets met, and Artaban set out to
meet the King.

For 10 days and nine nights, Artaban pressed
onward to the West until he arrived at nightfall of
the 10th day, beneath the shattered walls of populous
Babylon. But he could not rest for the temple was
three hours away, and he must be there by mid-
night if he would find his comrades waiting.

As he passed by a grove of date-palms, he came
across the pallid body of a Hebrew exile ravaged by
fever. Artaban thought he was dead, and he turned
away to be gone but he heard a ghostly sigh from
the man. At first, Artaban felt a dumb resentment.

If he lingered, he would miss the caravan and
lose his quest. But if he went on, the man would die.
Should he risk the great reward of his divine faith
for the sake of a single deed of human love? He made
a prayer for direction from the God of truth and
purity. And he turned back to the sick man and
restored his strength as only a skillful healer of
disease can do.

The poor Hebrew was overcome with wonder at
this unasked for service and was ashamed that he
had nothing to offer in return.

But he did tell Artaban that the Hebrew pro-
phets had said that the Messiah should be born not
in Jerusalem. but in Bethlehem of Judah. Artaban
hurried on, for it was long past midnight when he
left. the grove; it was dawn before he reached the
temple. But there was not a sign of the caravan of
the wise men, far or near.

Then he found a note to follow them across the
desert, but he would have to return to Babylon and
sell his sapphire to prepare for the journey. Even
then he might never overtake his friends. He might
lose sight of the King because he tarried to show
mercy.

AND ARTABAN set out across the dreary un-
dulations of the desert, through the valley of the
Jordan, until he arrived at Bethlehem on the third
day after the three wise men came to that. place
and had laid their gifts of gold, frankincense and
myrrh at the feet of the babe, Jesus.

The other wise man was full of hope that he had
found the King and could offer his ruby and his
pearl to him. But a woman with her baby in her arms
told Artaban that the strangers from the East had
come and gone and that the man of Nazareth had
taken the babe and his mother and fled to Egypt.

Even as she told him of the events of the past
few days, the Roman soldiers came to slaughter the
male children of the town. But Artaban saved this
woman's child by lying and bribing a captain with the

uby.
ARTABAN HAD SEARCHED three and 30 years
for the King when he came for the last time to
Jerusalem, having visited there many times in the
years before. It was the season of the Passover, and
the city was thronged with strangers. He fell in with
a group of Parthian Jews who were on their way to
Golgotha to see a Jesus of Nazareth crucified. The
heart of Artaban quickened with the apprehension
which is the excitement of old age. Would he be in
time to offer his pearl as ranson for the King?

But on his way to the Skull, he was faced with
the old conflict between the expectation of faith and
the impulse of love. Twice the gift which he had
consecrated to the worship of religion had been
drawn from his hand to the service of humanity.

This was the third trial, the final and irrevoca-
ble choice. He made the inevitable choice of saving
a young girl from slavery for her father’s debts and
gave her his pearl for a ransom.

Even as he did so, a tremor ran through the
earth and the old man was struck to the ground by
a tile from a roof. But what had he to live for? His
quest was over, and it had failed.

But there was peace in accepting that thought
for he knew that he had done the best he could from
day to day and had been true to the light that had
been given to him. He knew that even if he could
live his earthly life over again, it could not be other-
wise than it had been.

Then, as he was about to die, there came a
voice through the twilight, and the old man’s lips
began to move as if in answer:

““NOT SO, MY LORD: For when saw I thee
hungered and fed thee? Or thirsty, and gave thee
drink? When saw I thee a stranger, and took thee
in? Or naked, and clothed thee? When saw I thee
sick or in prison, and came unto thee? Three-and-
thirty years I have looked for thee; but I have never
seen thy face, nor ministered to thee, my king.’

“ ‘Verily, I say unto thee, Inasmuch as thou hast
done it unto one of the least of these my brethren,
thou hast done it unto me’.”

His journey was ended. His treasures were ac-
cepted. The Other Wise Man had found the King.”
