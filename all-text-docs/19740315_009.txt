Community Cafes Reduce
Campus Centered Lonliness

By JEAN MOLINIE

(Ed Note: This is the first of
a series of columns by studen-
ts examining the quality of
emotional life at Davidson in a
seminar with Student
Psychologist Meredith Hall.

What happens to an in-
ternational student when he
arrives in Davidson? First, he
is amazed by the cheerfulness
people show towards him: he
is welcomed everywhere,
everybody says: “‘hello’’ or
‘*hi’’, or ‘‘How’re you doing?’’.

As anyone in any foreign
country, he starts making
judgements about the people
of this country: ‘‘Americans
are really nice ie!"

He meets a lot of people who
ask him about the country he
comes. from...But little by lit-
tle, as the days go by, he
becomes more and more con-
scious that he doesn’t really
get to know the people he
meets and he realizes that
most of the conversations he
has with them are about the
weather, the last basketball
game or how hard the last test
was.

His opinion about American
people starts to change a bit
and he falls into a tendancy to
judge aand_— generalize:
‘“‘Americans are very super-
ficial’.

But he knows _ that
generalizations and over-
simplifications are often
wrong or partly wrong. So he
tries to find another cause to
this impossibility to relate
deeply to his American
friends: ‘‘maybe there is
something wrong with me”’ -
“maybe they don’t like me for
one reason or another”’.

But soon he realizes that the
conversations between
Americanstudentsare not that
deep either, and the topics not
very varied: exams,
professors, work, —
weekend, parties. reover,
he notices that the students
are always in a hurry to leave
the table at the eating house:
“I’m going to the library” -
“T’ve to finish a per’...

So, Sac won in David-
son? I think that two things
are ible for this kind of
situation: the work pressure
and the lack of meeting
places.

First the work pressure: the
students are racing for good

grades, cramming for their
exams as if their only purpose
was a diploma. They are con-
stantly under the pressure and
the threat of the exam.

When they have a moment
of rest, they just don’t want to
think, to discuss or to get in-
volved in a deep relationship
with anybody; they just want
to release their tension
through sport, drinking, par-
tying and forget everything.

his explains why some-
times, at one o’clock in
the morning, students, coming
back from the library, turn on
their stereo full volume...

Is that really a liberal arts
education? Is the purpose of a
liberal arts education to form
doctors, lawyers, business-
men who are proficient intheir
profession but who don’t know
and don’t want to know about
the rest of the world?

Or is it to form broad-
minded people who feel
responsible not only for their
business but for their country

-and the whole world as well

(which is becoming more and
more necessary), and who are
aware of the importance of
human relationship?

When Americans come to
France, they are amazed to
see the amount of time French
students ‘‘waste”’ in striking,
demonstrating, hanging
around ‘‘cafes’’. But is it
really a waste of time? Do you
think French people go to
“‘cafes’’ only to drink?

Most of the students who
have been on the J.Y.A.
program say that they have
discovered something, but
they don’t know what it is.
Maybe it’s just that one
doesn’t learn about life only in
books. Maybe, discussion and
relating to other people on a
deep level are very important
to education.

So, what todo? There are
these possibilities:

If this situation is due to the
mentality of. American
society, in general, it’s just a
matter of misunderstanding
between Americans and in-
ternational students, and
there is not much to do about
it.

If it’s a matter of oa
pressure, there are, maybe,
means to reduce this pressure,
and at the same time, keep the
high academic standard.

If it’s a lack of meeting
places, there is perhaps an op-
portunity to organize
something in this field. I’m
not proud of France or Mont-
pellier University, but there is
at least one thing which seems
to me better there than in
Davidson: the meeting places.

We have ‘‘cafeterias” where
you can go at any time (after
lunch or between classes, for
instance), and where you are
sure to find somebody to talk
to. I think that Davidson is
really missing such an in-
stitution. And-I’m not talking
only of the College.

I sincerely hope that the at-
mosphere in the college will
change in the future and that
people will have the op-
portunity to talk not only bet-
ween two mouthfulls of ham-

burgers!

Calendar Revision

(Continued from page 8)

At Dartmouth, many students are accelerating their
academic programs in order to finish their undergraduate
studies early. Others are enjoying career-service experiences
during the fall, winter, or spring terms which would not have
been possible during the summer due to the lack of employment
opportunities then.

Dartmouth adopted its present calendar basically as a means
of becoming fully coeducational. Even with its very substantial
resources and its generous constituency, the college did not
want to have to invest in enough additional housing to ac-
comodate more than a thousand women students.

By moving to a year-round calendar Dartmouth expects to be
able to expand its enrollment from 3200 to 4400 students without
adding significantly to its present facilities.

The experience of Dartmouth would seem to be directly
relevant to Davidson in a period in which we are trying to ex-
pand our enrollment to make room for women students without
the means to expand our facilities to the extent which is
required.

Interestingly enough, all four speakers, Dr. Gregory Prince,
Assistant Dean of Faculty at Dartmouth, Dr. Joan Stark,
Assistant Dean of Faculty at Goucher, Dr. William Stephenson,
Chairman of the Educational Policy Committee at Earlham,
and Dr. John Satterfield, Vice President for Academic Affairs at
Kalamazoo, commented that some form of year-round
operation seemed to be the most attractive option for Davidson.

Year-round operation would ensure that this beautiful and
well-equipped college would be more fully used than it is at
present. It would enable us to expand our enrollment without
building more dormitories and eating facilities. It would give us
a flexibility which is not possible once permanent physical
structures are built.

We could always return to a conventional calendar if there
were nolonger aneed tomake room for additional students. Since
much of the administrative, secretarial, and custodial staff is
employed year-round anyway, it should make for greater ef-
ficiencies in the operation of the college.

At the same time, a year-round calendar would involve cer-
tain difficulties. Department offerings would have to be spread
over the whole year, rather than nine months, and this would not
be easy, especially for small departments. And prospective
students might not like the idea of having to be here for one sum-
mer or possibly two.

But the Dartmouth plan has a good deal to recommend it, par-
ticularly at this juncture in the history of Davidson, and deser-
ves to be seriously considered.

Of course, whatever calendar is adopted for Davidson must be
adapted to our own needs and conditions and must be acceptable
to the members of our own academic community including
those who teach and those who learn.

Paduka Rationale Siphons
State Petrol Allocations

Paducah, Ky. has come up
with a plan for consumers to
make it through the gasoline
crisis. Unlike the Oregon plan.
the Paducah plan does not
entail buying gasoline on
alternate days.

The Paducah plan was star-
ted by a group of Paducah
citizens calling themselves
“People Indignant Over the
Gasoline Shortage” or PIGS
for short.

The PIGS mobilized after
the Kentucky National Guard
started practicing anemergen-
cy known as the
Ethyl Cordon. The Ethyl Cor-
don was to be used in the event
of the mobbing of gasoline
stations by angry consumers.

The leader of PIGS is a
young Paducah lawyer named
Edsel Smith. Mr. Smith is not
a normal lawyer, he is a gas-
lawyer. His specialty is high
octanes for large cars.

He was instramental recent-
ly in the of a new ser-
vice at Paducah’s largest
bank. This service known as
“Hope On A Rough Day” or
HOARD for short allows. con
sumers to rent gasoline
storage tanks by the week,
month or year .u which the)

can store as much as ten-
thousand gallons of their
favorite petroleum products.

The Paducah Plan for
Gasoline is a two-pronged at-
tack on the gasoline shortage.
The object of the Plan is to
teach consumers how to cut
down on gasoline costs while
doing as much driving as
possible. This is an important
service since gasoline costs as
muct as 70¢ a gallon in some
Stations around here.

Some of _ the
suggestions are:

(1) Try stealing your
gasoline. Many consumers
never consider this handy and
effective method of cutting the
cost of driving.

(2) Mix your petroleum.
Buy one-third of a tank of

plan’s

diesel fuel and one-third of a
tank of kerosene or rubbing
alcohol. Of course, the 1/3-1/3-
1/3 ratio might need to be
altered slightly for your car,
but the results of these ex-
periments can be instructive

_ and surprising.

(3) Put sand in your gas
tank. This sand will work its

way into the gasoline line and
keep the engine from using it
up So quickly.

(4) Buy gasoline only
during a heavy rain. You'd be
surprised at how quickly your
gas tank fills up during a rain-
storm.

(5) Run a hose from the
exhaust pipe of your car to the
gasoline tank. This helps in
two ways. First, you help
reduce pollution and second,
you make certain that no un-
burned gasoline fumes leave
your car.

1000 miles per month.
Hopefully, the Paducah
Plan, which is available in

booklet form, will catch on
