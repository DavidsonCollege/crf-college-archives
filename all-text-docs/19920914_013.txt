By Bruce Balestier

Davidson soccer coach
Charlie Slagle said at the start of
the season that he’d be happy ifhis
team could get through the first
three games of the season, against
#6 Wake Forest, #10 North Caro-
lina and #19. South Carolina, with
a.500 record, and this week he got
his wish to the letter. The Wildcats
lost to Wake Forest, but beat UNC

and tied USC to finish the three- .

game stretch at 1-1-1. This week-
end, the team upped its record to 3-
1-1.and.claimed the championship
at the MDA/Coca-Cola Classic in
Richmond with victories over
Fairleigh-Dickinson and Rich-
mond.

In the season opener Septem-
ber 5 against Wake in the first
round of the Wake Forest Soccer
Classic, the Wildcats were taken
out of their game somewhat by the
Deacons’ very physical style in a

4-2 loss. Wake was
called for 29 fouls in
the match, Davidson
just 14.

The Deacons
drew first blood ona
goal by Andrew
Chang early in the
first half. In the 25th
minute, midfielder
Andy Schwab made
a great move, and
twice had shots
saved by the goal-
keeper. Rob Ukrop

Davidson baseball will have
a huge spot to fill on the mound
this spring. Andy Paul, who ended
with an 11-4 record and a 2.71
ERA last season in his juniorcam-
paign, has said goodbye to
Davidson baseball and hello to
the Milwaukee Brewers organi-
zation. On June 23, Paul signed
an exceptional contract with the
Brewers, forcing him to forgo his
senior season.

The deal is exceptional in
that the Brewers are allowing Paul
to return to Davidson to finish his
senior year and graduate .. . and
the Brewers will pay for it.
Davidson baseball coach Dick
Cooke called the Brewers’ will-
ingness to pay for Paul’s educa-
tion “amazing . . . I had never
heard of an offer like that. They
[the franchises] usually want a
kid to finish school on his own
time, but Andy made it a priority
that he graduate from Davidson.”

The "Brew Crew" Gives
Paul an Offer He Can't Refuse

Recruited by Davidson as an
infielder, Paul didn’t pitch for
Davidson until his sophomore year.
Due to some injuries on the team
during the season, Paul was forced
to pitch for the first time since he
was sixteen. “I gotthrown outthere
kind of by default. I was learning
on the field . . .I had some really
terrible games,” Paul admits. He
wona few games, however, finish-
ing his sophomore season 4-6 with
about a 5.50 ERA.

Paul returned to Davidson last
fall ready to pitch. “I really con-
centrated on pitching for [the first
time],” Paul states. He had a good
fall season and was described in
the Davidson Baseball brochure as
the ace of the pitching staff. It was
supposed to be his big season.

But in December of last year
Paul began to get extremely tired
andrun down. In the first weeks of
January, he was admitted to the
hospital, and diagnosed as having

diabetes. He lost35 poundsand his

oy

vision changed. “Iwas a complete
mess. I had lost all of my strength,”

‘Paul remembers. But he was deter-

mined topitch. He told his doctors,
“Whatever I have to doso] can get
out there, I'll do, ‘cause I’m going
to pitch come February.” Coach
Cooke felt that Paul handled his
diabetes extremely well. “It was
unfortunate; however, Andy didn’t
expect to be treated differently, He
developed a great discipline with
[his diabetes],” he said.

Paul didn’t miss any starts,
but he started the season weak. He
started the first game of the season
against UNCC and got pounded,
allowing the first four batters he
faced to score. Paul admits that the
rocky start gave him doubts. “I
thought, ‘Oh this is great. This is
supposed to be my big season.’”

Butit would be about the only
low point of the season for him.
Paul went on to win eleven games,

second half, the Wild-
cats drew even when
senior Cliff Castelloe
ran down a ball on the
end line and fed it to
' Ukrop for a goal.
Matt Olin
(brother of Davidson
defender John Olin) got
the game-winner for
= the Deacons. Chang
- netted an insurance
goal in a scramble in
front of the goal with
two minutes to play.
While Slagle
felt that “the game was
very disjointed” be-
cause of Wake Forest’s
numerous fouls, he ac-
knowledged that his
team was able to create
good scoring opportu-
nities. “We got our
chances in the second half and just

didn’t put them away,” he said.
'‘ In the second round of the
‘Classic two days later, the ‘Cats
faced North Carolina. The protago-
nist in the match was a card-happy
referee, who handed out five red
cards and gencrally disrupted the
game, but Davidson earned a mean-
ingful 4-3 victory.

The Wildcats dominated play
early in the match, but a defensive
miscue allowed Carolina to score
first. After Davidson failed toclear
the ball just outside the box, the
Tar Heels’ Ben DiMco controlled
the loose ball and blasted it under
the cross bar for a 1-0 lead. Just a
little more than three minutes later,
though, with 11 minutes Ieft in the
half, the ‘Cats’ offensive pressure
paid off. Junior forward Ben Hayes,
in an extended one-on-one to the
Icft of the goal, was taken down

Women's Soccer
Storms Queens in
Season Opener

By Jen Lake

Astherain proceeded to come
down, Davidson’s women’s soc-
cer team proved to be a dark cloud
looming over the heads of its op-
ponent, Queens College.

Led by Launa Hankins and
freshmen offensive power, the
Wildcats won their season opener
5-1 on September Sth. The win is
consistent with past seasons, as the
“Cats have not dropped a game to
Queens in their four years of com-
petition.

The team was quite satisfied
with the end result, especially con-
sidering the onset of heavy rains
midway through the first half.

Coach Kevin Hundley com-
mented that “rain of that type can
prove to be an equalizer when it
comes to a team’s ability,” as the
players discovered at halftime,

when they held a slim, 2-1 lead.
Queens took advantage of the
weather to play an overly rough
and aggressive game versus the
finesse style of the Wildcats.

Newcomer Claudia Lombard
opened up the scoring with only
two minutes passed, receiving the
ball from a play made by Susan
Taylorand Ann Todd. Despite sev-
eral knocks and bumps, Hankins
dominated the scoring, netting the
first hat trick of the season for the
team. Her first came unassisted
about halfway through the first half.
Sarah Cantrell and Todd set up
Hankins’ second goal in the 66th
minute of the game.

A few minutes later, Hankins
padded the lead with goal number
three off a pass from Heather

Grisez Leads Women
Harriers to 2nd at ASU

By Pete Hurtado

The women’s cross-country
team began its fall campaign this
past Saturday with strong perfor-
mances from all eight runners at
the Appalachian State Invitational,
capturing second place behind
Southern Conference rival Appa-
lachian State, and ahead of UNC-
Asheville and UNC-Charlotte.
With two freshman and three
sophomores among the top seven
runners, Davidson’s future in the
Southern Conference looks bright.

Freshman sensation Marie
Grisez showed her stuff, finishing

fifth overall in an outstanding time
of 19:59 for 5k to lead the Wildcats
in her first ever collegiate race.

Sophomores Elizabeth Bishop
(20:19) and Carolyn Meadows
(20:28) ran tough and pulled away
from several UNCA runners late
in the race to sweep 6th and 7th
places, respectively. :

Sophomore Transfer Laura
Jordan (20:58, 12th) and junior
captain Jean DeMoss (21:07, 14th)
rounded out the strongest Davidson
top five in many years.
