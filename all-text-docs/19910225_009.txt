Davidson Together Program
Transcends Racial Lines

By John Patton

How muchdo youreally know
about Davidson? Do you know
that it is made up of four different
sections, some of which are di-
vided along racial lines?

Do you know that there has
never been a Black graduate of
Davidson College who lived in
Davidson?

The list could go on because
there are a lot of questions that
divide Davidson on racial lines. I
can’t say whether the racism in
Davidson is any different than in
Boston or Atlanta, but the racial

segregation, planned or not, is
there.

Those railroad tracks that tra-
ditionally have marked racial or
socio-economic boundaries in
many communities certainly do
so here.

They also served.as the cata-
lyst for Davidson Together.

Davidson Together is an at-
tempt to bridge some of the racial,
socio-economic, historical and en-
trenched boundaries. What is the
best way to cross these lines?

Well, we thought eating din-
ner in Black families’ houses
would be a start. The idea is that

two students eating in someone’s
house isn’t intimidating to strang-
ers because they are in the comfort
of their own houses.

Last year about 10 families
and 20 students participated. This
year we’re seen more families in
the community interested, so now
we need more student involvement
and ideas.

This is an opportunity for all to
make some good friendships and
make Davidson a real, together
community. Questions: call Sam
Adams -6169; John Patton -6135;
Kelly Thompson - 6265; Bennet
Waters -6071.

College Bowl: The Winningest
"Sport" On Campus |

By Arjun Srinivasan

Question-In what event has
Davidson beaten Virginia, Duke,
Wake Forest and N.C. State all in
the last year? The answer? College
Bowl.

Davidson has a long history of
fielding excellent College Bowl
teams; in fact, in 1979, Davidson
defeated, Harvard to, win the Na-
tional College Bowl title.

So what exactly is this event
that we are so good at? Well, sim-
ply put, College Bow! is a lot like
Jeopardy with teams. ..

Players answer questions

which are worth stated point val-.,

ues, and the team with most points
at the end wins the match.

Each year, Davidson travels to
several tournaments where we play
anywhere from 8 to 15 matches,
The tournaments usually last two
days,and teams come from several
states tocompete.

Davidson has not been suc-
cessful in gaining another national

Members of Davidson's College Bowl team officiate at the 1991 High-Q tournament

title, but we were national runner-
up in 1981 and fifth nationwide in
1982. We have posted a strong
record of which the school. can be
quite proud.
Davidson won the Berry Col-
lege Invitational in 1982, has won
the Southeast Invitational acouple
of times, was runner-up at the
1990 Duke Invitational, and most
recently finished third at the 1991

+ Southeast Invitational Tourna-

ment.
Davidson’s biggest. tourna-
ment each year is the Regional

- Tournament, in whichateam must

win its region to advance to na-

tional play. The fact that Davidson

is in the nation’s largest region
makes for stiff competition.
Although Davidson has not
won Regionals in several years,
we consistently do quite well; last
year we finished fourth out of 24
teams,and usually finish in the top
six.

the awards is the consistently

ee

Perhaps more important than.

strong record of the team. College
Bowl coach Hansford Epes is the
winningest coach on campus.

His teams have never finished
below a .600 winning percentage,
and over the last two years,
Davidson holds a cumulative rec-
ord of 45-21.

Of course the strength of a
school’s College Bowl team can-
not tell one how good that school
is. However, Davidson does havea
strong academic reputation, and we
can take pride that we have done,
and continue to do, so well in aca-
demic competition.

This year’s team consists of
Captain Doug Gibson (’91), Ste-
ven Libby (91), Arjun Srinivasan
(’92), David Campbell (“92--but
on leave), Bill Pomeroy (’94) and
alternate Greg Fisher(’94). The
team will travel to Lexington,
Kentucky on March 1 for this year’s
Regional Tournament, and we cer-
tainly plan to uphold Davidson’s
tradition of excellence.

What Is A Michael

W. Smith?

By Andy Hackett

_ Michael W. Smith’s posters in
the Union, announcing his perform-
ance in Baker Sports Complex on
Friday, March 15, are curiously
absent of key information.

For starters, Who is he? Gotta
beapop singer, judging by his not-
entirely accidental resemblance to
George Michael.

So, why isn’t he topping the
charts? He is....the Christian rock

_ charts. I would have liked to dis-

cover that someone was breaking
ground in this field.
Unfortunately, the overly-
preachy ,musically-mediocre stere-
otypes fit Smith like a glove.
Smith wrote songs in Nash-
ville before he joined Amy Grant’s

touring band on keyboards, and ~

penned. some of her more popular
tunes. :

In 1983 he released his first
solo album, and this latest release
is his seventh solo effort. If Smith

*t progressed musically be-
yond this material over the course
of seven albums, I must conclude
that he has very little to offer out-
side the pre-teen, Christian rock
market. :

I certainly don’t argue with
Smith’s aim of writing positive
lyrics and “helping the kids make
the right decisions”; his is an ap-

plaudable goal, and Heaven knows
N.W.A. isn’t doing their part.

However, Smith would be
better suited to pontificate from
the pulpitand not the microphone.

Those lyrics that aren’t
preachy are syrupy and elemen-
tary, but blame his co-writers for
that; blame Smith himself for the
music.

Apart from his vocals resem-
bling Richard Marx on estrogen,

‘almost every song sounds like a

Debbie Gibson throwback - cli-
ched instrumentation, hackneyed
song structures, and the obliga-
tory horns/strings/gospel choir
tune necessary to be considered a
“sophisticated pop artist’.

The reason he hasn’t crossed
over into the mainstream poparena
with a semi-secular song is be-
cause it would likely sound like a
Honey Comb cereal commercial.

This doesn’t mean that heisn’t
a good live act, though; his press
kit lauds his past performances,
but we all have biases.

Factor in the six dollar student
discount and Christian rap open-
ers DC Talk, and we may have an
uplifting experience knocking at
ourback door.

If, however, you want to hear
a positive message and powerful,
original music, too late!....you’ve
already missed King’s X.
