Book thefts deplete brary

By DAVE KELLER
Staff Writer

Even though the E.H. Lit-
tle Library has solved a num-
ber of its logistic difficulties
with its new computer catalog-
ing system, there is still a
major problem which evades
solution: stolen books.

In last year’s annual inven-
tory alone there. were found to
be 304 books missing from the
library’s shelves without a
trace.

As large as this number
seems, it is nonetheless mild
compared to the totals of 451
and 360 books unaccounted
bor in the two previous years.

Looking at these losses from
a financial standpoint, Library
Director Leland Park said,

New Assistant Dean Dietler
laments student lethargy

By ANDREA MURPHY
Staff Writer

All it takes is a splashy
yellow dress and long straw-
berry blonde hair worn by a
tall, attractive woman for one
to realize that they aren’t on
Will Terry’s side of the dean’s
offices. {nstead, you. are with
the new Assistant Dean: of
Students, Mary Lou Dietler.
Young, enthusiastic and out-
going, Dietler is a refreshing
new addition to the admini-
stration.

In her position as Assistant
Dean of Students, Dietler is
conscientious to point out that
she is not: a new Dean of
Women Students. In her opin-
ion, the deans’ offices should
reflect a situation that exists
in normal society. Men and
women aren’t entities divided
into segmented worlds - and,
consequently, the deans’ of-
fices won't be either.

Although she recognizes the
contention that the needs of
men and women differ, she
feels that a solution to these
varying situations can be of-
fered by the particular person-
ality best suited to that speci-
fic problem. Consequently it
is not a question of gender as
to who one ought to seek out
when confronted with a prob-
lem,

Dietler’s own history as a
student started at Longwood
College in Virginia and then
later she continued her gradu-
ate studies at the University
of Virginia..Her various de-
grees include Math, Counsel-
ing, and Business and Educa-
tional Administration.

When asked to compare her
own undergraduate experience
with the undergraduate life of
today, Dietler particularly

noted a change in the political
climate of the campuses. Her
years in school were spent in
the midst of a good deal of
political and social upheaval.
The Vietnam War with all
its ensuing repercussions was
of major concern to students.
Out of this, political focus was

For Dietler’s part, as Stu-
dent Government President,
she took an active role as a
student legislator in a Virginia
state organization for S.G.A.
presidents of colleges and
universities.

Dietler personally chaired
the steering committee which
concentrated on which issues
to focus on in their presenta-
tion to the State Legislature.
This was a process that was

instrumental in the elimina-

tion of the necessity for stu-
dent lobbying.

In contrast, Dietler feels
that the concern of the under-
graduate today has shifted
more in the direction of the
increasing job squeeze that
will face post-graduate college

students. Consequently in™

picking majors, students are
more likely to orient’ them-
selves in a direction that will
prove most useful when they
have to contend with the tight
job market.

Meanwhile, while the Da-
vidson undergrad is still on
campus, Dietler explained how
she wishes them to view her
office.

“If you don’t know hwere to
start, this is the place,” was
her initial comment.

She hoped the office would
be a place where any student
would feel free to. go under’any
circumstances. She also feels
it can act as a liason between
students and faculty. The
office works in an advisory

and counseling capacity and
basically as a campus humani-
zation unit, goals which Diet-
ler is looking forward to
fulfilling.

replace these books. That
means losses of at least three
or four thousand dollars each
year, losses which cut consi-
derably into our annual book
budget.”

The worst aspect of these
thefts is not the financial but
rather the fact that a great
number of the stolen books are
irreplaceable.

“A few of these books can
be bought from out-of-print
book dealers, but the cost of
labor in finding such books
plus their inflated cost make
this proposition at times very
impractical,’’ said Park.

“Added to this is the fact
that because of the current
economic situation, many
publishers are publishing indi-
vidual editions in much smal-
ler numbers, often making
replacement virtually impos-
sible. Lack of funds in indi-
vidual departments, which
pay one-half the price of books
they wish replaced, is also a
limiting factor.

“The blame,’’ said Park, “‘is
not leveled at any one group of
library users, but on thought-
less and irresponsible people in
general.”’

He also said that, in the
past, there was evidence of
professional theft of expensive
books; this problem has evi-

funds; Volumes irreplacable

dently disappeared, though.
The potentioal solution to
this problem is simple: moni-
toring library users as they
enter and leave. This can be4
done in two ways, electroni-
cally by,means of a system
which consists of magnetically
sensitizing each library book
and placing sensors at the
exit, or manually by placing a
guard at the library exit who
will search each leaving user.
Both of these methods are
quite expensive: around
$50,000 initially and $2,000
each year for the first, and

\ about $18,000 annually for the

second.

The E. H. Little is one of
the few unmonitored libraries
of its size left, and Park hopes
to keep it that way.

“A free library is very much
a privilege, and exists mainly
because of the honor system,”
said Park.

Freedom at the door will
last as long as we want it to
last. I hope that our library
doesn’t become as others I’ve
been in, where a user is seen as
a potential thief as soon as he
enters the door; things are so
much better here, where I find
it a pleasure to work for and
with people who are honorable
and have a sense of responsi-
bility.”

yourself with responsibilities fully in keeping with
your training, and with the time and opportunity to

When you decide on the specialty you wish to
pursue, you may find yourself taking those

count on that training being second fo none.
