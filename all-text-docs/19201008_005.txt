Buy a fresh cap for fifteen cents light
and sell it for a dollar and a half—
That’s business.

Modern Motive Might

way before electricity, the magic mo-
tive power. Properly applied, it drives giant
locomotives across the continental divide,
tows ocean liners through the Panama Canal,
or propels huge ships.

Through good light, safe signals, and illumin-

portation, making it quicker, safer, more eco-

transportation, in generating and transmit-
ting apparatus as well as motive mechan-
isms, are the co-ordinated scientific. engi-
