_ MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1995

The media did it

In a summer movie season of
lackluster action blockbusters it
has been refreshing to come home,
make a batch of buttered popcorn,
flip on CNN and watch all the
highlights of the NATO bombing
of Serb positions in Bosnia. Ted
Koppel, Peter Jennings, and the
like dazzle our imaginations with
tales of laser-guided “smart”
bombs raining over the Serb ag-
gressors. The best part is clearly
those military black and white pool
videos. with that little building in
the cross hairs being blown to
pieces. One can even cuddle up
with The New York Times after
dinner as if it was a Stephen King
novel and read all about the de-
monic Bosnian Serb leader, Gen-
eral Mladic.

Is this at all reminiscent of the

U.S. bombing of Iraq a couple years
ago? That media-brainwashed
operation in 1991 had neat terms
like “surgical bombing” and “‘col-
lateral damage” as well. Ameri-
cans could feel satisfied that by
just “bombing the hell” out of
someone, everything would be
better. Of course, destruction was
strictly limited to non-civilian tar-
gets as our infallible smart bombs
never “went stupid.”

Furthermore and most impor-
tantly, the culprits were clearly
being punished. All the media has
to do is demonize the opponent a
couple times to gain the uncondi-
tional support of the American
public. During the Gulf War,
George Bush had a clever tactic of
purposely mispronouncing the
Iraqi leader’s first name so it closer

resembled the word “sodomy.”
America has yet to hear Bill
Clinton’s version of Slobodan
Milosevic.

The purpose behind the bit-
terly sarcastic introduction and title
is to raise the issue of the U.S.
media’s depiction of the Bosnian
Serbs in the civil war of former
Yugoslavia. There is no question
that the Serbs have committed vari-
ous atrocities in Bosnia. Too many
witnesses have seen the Muslim
graves and Serbian prison camps.
When is a brutal civil war involv-
ing ethnic conflict ever “neat and
tidy’?

The media has clamored for
pictures showing Muslim refugees
evicted from their homes by the
Serbs. But at least as many Serbs
have been forced out of theirhomes

by the Muslims and Croats in this
war of ethnic cleansing. The
Bosnian Serb offensive in
Srebenica and other areas this sum-
mer was met with widespread con-
demnation and outrage by the U.S.,
yet ironically Washington watched
the Croatian blitzkrieg of the
Krajina region with a satisfied si-
lence.

Now, the U.S. and its Western
allies have labeled the Bosnian
Serbs as the enemy and have taken
punitive actions against them with
the media reinforcement. This
same kind of American partiality
resulted in the marine barracks
being blown up in Beirut and its
“peacekeepers” being attacked in
Somalia. Ifthe United States should
learn anything from its previous
involvement and intervention in

civil strife in a collapsed state, it
should be not to take sides, or at
least not to make it apparent to a
potential threat that it has done so.

To be honest, the civil war in
the former Yugoslavia is nota vital
interest of mine, but I cannot help
but feel inundated by the media
coverage it receives and skeptical
of some of its value, particularly
when the U.S. military is involved.
This article is not meant to be a
defense of the Serbs who have

.raped, tortured, and killed many

innocent people in the civil war but
instead to raise a question about
the American media and whether
it manipulates public opinion to
conform with the policies and in-
terests of the government. Who
knows, maybe Saddam Hussein

‘was right?

The numbers game

Okay, I admit it. When I first
heard that Davidson slipped, or
shall I say plummeted, to twenty-
first in U.S. Gossip and World
Scandal, \ was a tad bit perturbed.
Actually, I freaked. Visions of a
Mexican law school danced in my
head, replacing those of any school
in the Northeast. Suddenly, my
impressions of this college as one
of the elite vanished, at least for a
moment.

I ran to my file box to photo-
copy all my applications from last
year, to change the date, and to
send them out again. “Maybe
there’s still time to transfer,” I
thought.

This, of course, says far more
about me than it does the school.
Sure, it was nice that Davidson
was a “top ten” institution, but did

that happen overnight? No. It took
years of hard work by administra-
tors, the admissions office, the stu-
dents, etc. Just as it took time for
the college to ascend to the height
of greatness, it also takes time for
any to fall. Surely nothing could
go so wrong in one year that the
halo that surrounds this institution
would suddenly disappear.

I, like many of the freshmen
I’ ve met here, chose this school for
several reasons. Academic repu-
tation was one of them, yet I didn’t
even get a copy of that bird cage

. liner (no anger here) until after my

applications were filed. It’s nice to
be recognized with a great rank-
ing, but even if Davidson loses all
of its renown (which by no means
it has), it will still be every bit the
school, or more, that it was a year

ago. Nothing’s changed except
the numbers.

And how do they determine
these ratings anyway? Did
Davidson not have a toilet-to-stu-
dent ratio as high as Amherst’s?
Did Williams hire that extra chef?
Perhaps Davidson students took a
dive on that all important, all over-
rated test: the SAT. Maybe a
school’s ranking is inversely pro-
portional to the number of student
held subscriptions for that, that. . .
tabloid (I’m not bitter).

Regardless of the reason
Davidson dropped, it shouldn’t
make me think twice about my
decision to go here: Mexican law
school. - Goodness knows the
workload didn’t suddenly get
lighter, which reminds me—jAy
caramba! It’s due Monday?!

A prayer

Dear Lord...
Bitter is not what I want to be.
I do not want to resent each
white face I see. Davidson is “‘con-
servative,” which means I am not?

Therefore, it is okay for some

whites to be racist; but, me, I must
stay open minded and accept these
“minor” pains for the great “gains”
that will benefit me in the future
(of which I may never live to see).

Blind my eyes: plug my ears.

To be racist is my greatest

fear.

The most ignorant emotion ex-
pressed by amanis racism. Itis so
powerful that if used directly or
indirectly its powers are just as
effective. A man who harbors rac-
ism cannot harbor LOVE, because
the disease feeds off the very na-
ture of that person’s heart.

Build me inside STRONG; but
outside, weak, so I’ll appear less
intimidating: fragile and meek.

My theory is that whites are afraid
that blacks may want revenge for
all those years of slavery: we want
your schools, your jobs, your
spouses—your lives to atone for
your ancestors’ mistakes. As a
result, you want to ostracize us,
keep us “down.” And yet, keep a
good eye on us “black folk” to be
sure we don’ thave a trick ortwoup
our sleeves.

Lord +; ;

If my tears were of sugar,
maybe it wouldn’t hurt as much to
cry,

Or you could just make the
salt less bitter so that it doesn’t
sting my eye.

I do not cry because I regret
being African-American. but be-
cause I will never be African or
American, only the unknown dash
between that truly represents me.

I was motivated to write this
piece for those racist guys whom I

came across at the Union Outpost
Wednesday night, September 6.
Although nothing physically or
verbally racist was addressed to-
ward me, I felt responsible for the
cold stares and attitudes that these
guys directed at my white friend.

I realize that as a minority
here at Davidson I must accept that
not everybody is going to be my
friend. However, what I was not -
prepared for was that those few
people who are mature enough to
view others as individuals would
also. castigate for their
unconservative outlook.

I can’t decide which hurts
more: not having any non black
friends or putting these brave souls
through the anguish that even I,
after years of experience, can barely
handle. I pray things here at
Davidson will not get to the point
where I will have to make a deci-
sion.
