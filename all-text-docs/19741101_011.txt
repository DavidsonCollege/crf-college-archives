UNC-CH Conquers Wildcats
In Rough Club Football Joust

By BILL LLOYD
Staff Writer

The Davidson College Club
Football team continued its
winless season last Saturday
in a tough 14-8 loss to UNC-CH.

Approximately 35 bleary-
eyed Wildcats dragged them-
selves up to the varsity prac-
tice field Saturday morning to
be confronted by a polished
squad of about 50 uniformed
Chapel Hill football players in
the middle of their con-
centrated warm-up
calisthenics.

Either as a result of this
warm-up foolishness or
because of a Friday night

Homecoming party, several
Davidson players were seen
regurgitating in the woods
bordering the field.

After a 20 minute delay in
order that a game ball, chains
and a chain crew might be
procured, the contest got un-
derway with Chapel Hill
kicking off.

As in the past, the Davidson
offense was momentarily
unable to generate a potent at-
tack.

After a series of punts, fum-
bles and interceptions, Chapel
Hill scored on a well thrown 35
yard pass late in the first
quarter. A perceptual break-

Ruggers Drop Pair
In Hardfought Scrums

By FRED SMITH

Two weeks ago the David-
son Rugby Club travelled to
Charlotte to play a match
against that city’s club. Laden
with academia and upset
stomachs, the Wildcats did not
have a very large turnout.
Technically the match was
over before it started as
Davidson could not field the
necessary men. However, the
match got under way when
several Charlotte ruggers.
volunteered to perform on
Davidson’s behalf.

The first half was well-
played and highly defensive.
Play moved up and down the
field with both teams utilizing
kicks in to touch to their ad-
vantage. Late in the half,
however, Charlotte broke
through Davidson’s defenses
for two tries. Neither extra
kick was good and the half-
time score was 8-0 in favor of
Charlotte.

Davidson came out to play
in the second half. The backs,
running well, were able to

-keep pressure on Charlotte’s -

defense while a pursuing
scrum held their offense in
check. The Wildcats finally
scored near the middle of the
half when Bob Schermer got
the ball out of the scrum and
virtually ran through the en-

tire Charlotte team for a try.
The kick was wide, but David-
son was back in the game at 8-
4. :

Charlotte came back to
score another try and extra
kick to make it 14-4. Davidson
ruggers attempted to stage a
comeback but just couldn’t
punch the ball across the try
line. The final score for this
match was 14-4, Charlotte.

-Last Sunday the Hampden-
Sydney ruggers travelled to
Davidson for a match on
Homecoming weekend. At-
tendance at the match was
light as ruggers had trouble
responding to the scheduled
time of 10 a.m. Finally, at
about, 11 a.m. a ball was found
and enough players had shown
up to play a match.

The match was not well
played by either side. At the
end of the uneventful first
half, the score was Hampden-

' Sydney 3, Davidson 0.

The second half was marred
by arguments and disputes

’ with the official; both sides

were glad when the game was

over and they could have a ©

beer. The final score was 9-0,
Hampden-Sydney. The parties
for the Charlotte and Hamp-
den-Sydney games were non-
competitive.

This week’s match against

’ Tennessee is cancelled. The

next match is on Nov. 10 with

Only 6 miles north

Davidson secondary resulted
in the score. The extra point
made the score 7-0.

After a prolonged half-time ,
the Davidson offense began to
move down the field directed
by quarterback Carlyle
Sherrill and aided by running
backs Bob Bishop, Tim Sellers
and Phil Oblinger.

Utilizing a play straight
from the flickerball fields,
Sherrill hit flanker Mark Firth
on a “sleeper” pass to bring
Davidson to Chapel Hill’s 10
yard line. Three plays later
Sherrill sneaked over for the
touchdown.

The two point conversion
was good and for the second
time in two years, Davidson
was beating the Club
Tarheels.

For the next 20 minutes, the
Wildcats played tough defense
led by Bob Olmstead and Buzz

With 15 seconds left, Chapel
Hill lined up for what was to be
the last play of the game. A 40
yard bomb was ‘thrown into
the end zone and into the arms
of a speeding Tarheel
receiver.

Covering closely but not
closely enough on the play for
Davidson was number 28,
identified by irate teammates
only as some short, curly-
haired kid.

The beaten Davidson cor-
nerback never broke stride
and continued across the soc-
cer field and into the showers.
The extra point for Chapel Hill
was good.

So once again, the Davidson
Club Football. team snatched
defeat from the jaws of vic-

tory by a 14-8 margin.
