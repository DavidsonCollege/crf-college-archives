- BOND ISSUE PROVIDES
_ CIVIC IMPROVEMENTS

Bonds for extensive improvements in the
town of Davidson were put on the market
in the past few days and bids were sent in
by several prominent bond concerns. At a
meeting of the town ‘commissioners © on
March 22nd, Mayor Hamilton awarded the
contract to Weil, Roth and Irving, Cincin-
nati, Ohio, whose bid was a premium of
$600 on the amount, $120,000, and interest
at the rate of 5% per cent. The nearest
bid to this was only $20 under on the pre-
miums and the rate of interest was the
same.

The issue is to provide for the extension
of water mains to be supplied from a group
of tube wells to be sunk west of the town ;
sewerage and lighting system, and a con-
tinuation of street improvements. In con-
nection with the latter, surveyors are here
now representing Mees & Mees, civil en-
gineers of Charlotte, making a survey of
Main Street. W. H. Booker, of Charlotte,
and Thomas W. Swinson have oversight
of the work.

events the greatest trouble is to develop a
first class broad jumper. Lindawood looks
good for many points in the weight events
and’ Gracy has shown his versatility by en-
tering all the other field events.

There are five men in school who can
clear ten feet in the pole vault, so there is
little need for worry there. In the high
jump Calhoun and Gracy are getting the
highest and will push other jumpers in the

state to the limit. Gracy, McCombs and
Lindawood have each tossed the javelin be-
yond the 150-foot mark, so the Wildcats
are well fixed there.

The two weakest places on the team are
to be found in the low hurdles and broad
jump. Several new men, Mallory, Calhoun,
Davis and others, have recently come out
for these events, and Coach Grey hopes
to find some good men before the first meet.

Debaters for First Meet

representatives, although new to the field of
intercollegiate rebating, are well worthy of
the task which has been intrusted to them.

In the last year Warren, Cox has forged
steadily to the front as a speaker. As a
member of the Pendenic Society he has won
both the Fresh-Soph Debater’s and the
Fresh-Soph declaimer’s Medals. Elkins, a
member of the Eu has won both the Fresh-
Soph and the Juunior-Senior Debater’s
Medals in his society and has become noted
for his impressive delivery as well as logical
argument. Hillhouse, another Eu, although
not winning any society honors as yet,
proved by his clearly arranged speech, in
the preliminaries, that he is full worthy of
his place on the team.

The preliminaries, held in the Phi Hall
were of the highest type. Twelve men,
seven Juniors, four Seniors and one Fresh-
man took part. For more than two hours
and a half the debate raged pro and con
and it was not without careful consider-
ation on the part of the judges that the
team was decided upon. The men taking
part, besides the members of the team were:
W. P. Kimsey, Wallace Moore, Ralph
Smith, Leroy Burney, C. E. Hodgin, A. H.
Hollingsworth, and D. B. Walthall. The
judges for the debate were: Doctors Sen-
telle, Porter, Shewmake and Arbuckle and
Captain Hearn.
