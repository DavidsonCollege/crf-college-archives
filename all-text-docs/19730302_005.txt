Nid's Tongue Scorched,
Mott No Longer Exists

I the Masked Nid me am
writing this time the calumny
porque Mott pobre the Wopple
he is not so good lately you know
maybe because what he do for
me with the King Kudzu
sometime ago last postnight
when he find out that they don’t
give me back everything they
take away when they send me
you remember maybe to the
Phantom Zone and I don't exist
no more.

Anyway, my friend Mott he
knows me before I go over to
Iberia and me and him we the
Founding Fathers of the
Aviarial Bird and Aardvark
Watching Society and Marching
Band which you peoples don't
know about and now will please
forget about or else which is a
very secretive society except
for the fiesta we begin some
years ago without anybody
should know you remember it
maybe we call it Christmas. But
no matter.

Anyway, then I go over to the
Iberia which is why I come back
sounding so funny since I burn
my tongue on a taco and this
calumny she don't coming out
right because I have to use a
typewriter I bring back with me
that writes only in Iberian
which is kind of Spanish Yiddish
I don't know you maybe should
ask Rogerson he tell you.

But everything is okay when I
over there except that most
everybody they are shooting
each other but I have with me
my Davidsoniana book on
“Wound Ballistics"’ (you look in
that room, you find it) so I learn
a lot anyway.

But everything is okay when I
try come back you know the
USA give me my visa okay and
I come back to here but King
Kudzu tell me I not here you
know like I sink in the ocean and
don't exist anymore.

He show me this blank paper
and say “This you transcript
and it nothing so you don't exist
you catch on?"

Well, so then I scared because
I never not exist before but Mott
he write about it and Numb
Elroy he help and then they find

that somebody one of King Kud-
zu's friends had been using my

transcript for wallpaper or
something.
So now they think that

everything is okay but then I
find out that the study I do isn't
okay because I do ten things
and they say I can only do nine
so they give me credit for eight.
Right?

Anyhow, so Mott find out
about it and he go last postnight
he go to Numb Elroy and ask if
there is precedence you know
history for this kind of Kudzu
thing happening and Numb
Elroy look it up in the ‘‘Bluebook
of Davidashire’’ and find out
about Longterm Looey.

Longterm Looey he come to
Davoidson in 1897 you know
from High School Number One
in the Country with a 5.76
average on a scale of 4.0 and he
a eager-beaver so he work hard
and take seven courses a term
so he finish everything in less
than two years.

But then they tell him make a
mistake. He can't do that he too
far ahead. So he can't graduate
until he catch down.

So since then Longterm Looey
work hard as he can at not
working because the less he do
the sooner he can graduate so
he got his terms planned out so
for the first two terms he do
nothing and then he do less the
third term.

But it hard to find enough
courses not to take. He already
not taken all thescourses there
are so there are none left for
him not to take so‘he just crouch
in a corner of the computer
room thinking about nothing till
hiss ears steam.

So when Mott find this out, he
go to King Kudzu (a big mistake
that) and rant and rail but Kud-
zu he just rattle his leaves and

laugh.

Then he tell Mott that money
people figure out that he ( Mott)
didn't exist neither. —

Because they supposed to
send Mott a notice for Mott to
ask them for money you know
but they can't find his post of-
fice box so they figure he don't

exist so they scratch his name
off the Existent List.

So if he don't exist for his
junior year he don’t exist his
senior year, right?

So now Mott, he don't feel so
good. He been going around
digging up proof that he real
you know? So he got a list now
of all the Mott things that are
obviously named for him. He
got a book now called ‘‘Motts in
History and Legend.”

So if you drive by Harry and
Clara Mott's house or read
about Joe Christmas getting
caught in Mottstown or buy
Mott's Clamato Juice or eat
matzo balls, please tell him so
he can add it to his list. He don't
feel so good and it affecting his
skin. He all mottled.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

FACULTY COLUMN

Self-Made Citizens
Laud Nixon Efforts

By E. F. Patterson
‘

(Editor's Note: This column is the first in a series written by
Davidson professors. The subject of the column is, and will con-
tinue to be, that of the professor's choosing. We would encourage all
faculty interested in contributing to contact anyone on THE
DAVIDSONIAN staff.)

President Nixon is to be commended for his resolve to return this
country to a situation where individualism and _ laissez-faire
prevail, one where “in our own lives let each of us ask—not just
what will government do for me, but what can I do for myself.”
Every self-made person—and that includes everyone not on
welfare—will surely applaud Mr. Nixon's resolve and pledge full
support for his efforts.

In line with carrying out this resolve, the self-made majority will
insist that all welfare payments be ended immediately, for this in-
come obviously does not arise from what the welfare recipients
have done for themselves.

To be fair—and the self-made majority surely wants to be
fair—they will also insist that all direct and indirect government
subsidies to individuals and corporations be ended—estimated by
the Joint Economic Committee of Congress to be $63 billion in 1970.
They may want to insist further that Penn-Central, Lockheed, Lit-
ton, et. al.. be required to return the recent special payments the
companies have received from the Federal government, amoun-
ting to several hundred million dollars.

In case someone may consider this latter demand to be an unfair
and harsh burden on these poor, on-the-verge of bankruptcy firms,
it can be balanced by demanding that past welfare payments be
returned also.

There may be some, hopefully only a very few, among the self-
made majority who may feel that this last action is a tiny bit too
harsh. One can rest assured that before these weak sentiments
produce any lasting traumatic effects on these individuals so as to
prevent the action, learned scholars will produce articles and books
to justify the action with ample supporting evidence from the Bible,
the Koran, the Upanishads, etc.

The self-made majority will undoubtedly want the conditions
restored that were considered essential for individualism and
laissez-faire to function properly to ensure that everyone receives
his just desserts. Among these conditions, as set forth by the
philosophers of laissez-faire—John Locke, Adam Smith, et.
al.,—were equality and individual action, as opposed to collective
action.

The Federal government, therefore, will have to bring about an
equal distribution of income and property and abolish such in-
stitutions as the corporate form of business enterprise and the
trade union, for these latter enable results to be obtained through
collective action that could not be secured if done as individuals.

One hopes that the self-made majority will not be deterred by any
sentimental appeals from the welfare recipients or the recipients’
namby-pamby. ‘do-gooder’’ spokesmen—the latter have been
thoroughly discredited by their actions against the Vietnam War
which, for four years, prevented Mr. Nixon from achieving *‘peace
with honor’’—. but will demand that Mr. Nixon carry his noble
resolve to its logical and final conclusion. A few weaker souls may
perish, but the self-made majority can dismiss these cases from
their minds by considering how the morals and character of those
who survive will be improved and strengthened.

Dollar Used To Purge Campus,
Speedy End To College Loans

To the Editor:

It is indeed time to ‘‘Come
Home America!"’

My reason for writing this let-
ter is that I feel that I must in-
form those of you who have not
yet realized it, that for the first
time in our politically-conscious
lives we no longer have a Viet-
nam war issue.

In response to this absence of
a foreign policy rallying stan-
dard, the cry has gone out to
bring our concerns home, a
cause which has my full sup-
port. However, in contrast to
our previously unselfish and
humanitarian stands, I would
suggest that we indeed bring
our concerns all the way home
right to.eur own little college
and our own little wallets.

In last week's DAVIDSON-
IAN, you may be awareof recent
developments in Washington
regarding the new budget. Now
that we, the students of
America, are no longer being
removed from the campus by

power of the Selective Service
System, the ‘‘Almighty Dollar”
will now be employed to purge
our campuses.

The new budget proposals of
our benevolent leader include
among other things, three
major cutbacks in federal
money for college purposes.
(These cutbacks are necessary
for the increase which will be
made in building bigger and
better bombs with which we are
to maintain a just and
honorable peace. )

First, monies for College
facility construction loans have
been frozen. This means tha‘
our new dorms are likely of
poorer quality and later in

Secondly, monies have been
cut to federal programs which
provide funds for assistance to
minority students. I for one, like
‘many of my colleagues, are in
full support of the demands ot
the BSC among which; is the
proposal to bring more blacks

to Davidson. Unfortunately,
since it is a regretable Socio-
logical fact that minority groups

ft ine auase endian
someone is going to feel a finan-
cial aid pinch.

But the best has been saved
for last.. That financial aid
pinch, which you all know will
be felt by middle class students,
has been further complicated.
Those of you reading this,
check around and see how
many students are on Direct
Student Loans. Yes, friends,
money for that program has
also been cut.

So friends, if by now you are
sufficiently incensed, why not
dash a quick letter to your
congressman? He may not lis-
ten, but at least you will be
participating in that great
democratic process that, after
our protests, did indeed bring a
“speedy end to that conflict in
S. E. Asia.”
