College Unions Become
Strong Educating Forces

(L.P.) College Unions are becoming a stronger educational
force in higher education than ever before, according to Mrs.
Tracy Johnson, Memorial Union program director on the
campus of Oregon State College. Mrs. Johnson cited two
examples of the use of memorial unions for graduate study.
Studies conducted at the University of Wisconsin were “Does
union service really prepare students for better citizenship?”

and “Basic designs for the activities program of college

unions.”

She also stated that the use of
unions as art centers, both for
promoting art exhibits and hous-
ing permanent collections, is gain-
ing importance. At the University
of Toronto, Canada, Hart House
has a permanent collection of
Paintings by Canadian artists.

The OSC Memorial Union has
acquired three original paintings
during the past year, Mrs. John-
son continued. The M. U. has al-
so lead in leadership training so-
cial education. Mrs. Johnson has
the distinction of being the only
woman appointed to the National
Research Committee of the Asso-
ciation of College Unions. This
committee is composed of nine
people and their objective is to

improvo the educational, cultural,
recreational, social, and. service as-
pects of college unions,
