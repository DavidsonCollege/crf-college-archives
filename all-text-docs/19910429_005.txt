THE DAVIDPHONIAN

OPINIONS

MONDAY, APRIL 29, 1991 5

When I was a boy I had a
terrible problem. I just couldn’t
make it through the night without
wetting myself. When little Billy
or Jimmy would invite me over to
spend the night, I would justblush,
and decline, too ashamed to tell
them. the awful truth about my
bladder control problem. I would
even have to resort to horrible lies
to cover up, and claim to have to
Stay at home to help my mother
with her crack dealing business,
and my father with the day to day
administration of his child pornog-
raphy ring.

My problem was compounded
as I aged. Summer camp -- a
dream, never to be reality. When
the other kids were going out on
dates, I was at home with a bedpan
and The Love Boat. Life was a
miserable series of embarrassing
incidents and P-spots on my jeans.

I tried everything imaginable
toend this problem, but none of the
conventional methods were effec-
tive. Pills, lotions, exercises, spe-
cial pants, all were vain attempts to
change my life. And then, on my
18th birthday, it happened.

likes of which I had previously
never experienced began to en-

my whole world changed. The

sexual release, but a doorway to a

Without going into any de- ,
tails, I learned that day about
the joys, not to mention the |
therapeutic merits of masturba-
tion. Masturbation is such a
terribly clinical name for my
hobby, [hate to useit. Thereare
several other labels by which
this activity is known, and I
prefer them all to the purely
medical term “masturbation.”
Some call it “choking the
chicken,” others say “spanking
the monkey,” “slammin’ the
spam,” “dancing with yourself,”
“meeting the bearded one,” or
“snuggling the fuzzy.” Those

Recently, we haveexperienced
a revelation of sorts. You may
recall seeing, in this space, a col-
umnentitled Beyond Birkenstock.
Well, the Birkenstockers live; they
merely exist in anew and improved
form. This revelation is such that
it has changed our priorities be-
yond recognition. You must be
thinking to yourselves, “What
could have brought about this
change? What could have altered
our beloved Birkenstockers? Was
itsex? Wasit wine? Was itSong?
Was it cold, harsh reality?”

Well friends, it was none of the
above. Illegal drugs have revealed

anew and wonderful existance to

the Birks. Pot, to be precise. This
is why we are devoting an entire
week’s column to exhorting the
Davidson Community to grow their
own Pot! That’s right boys and

girls. The answer to all of your
problems doesn’t lie in the books
you have been reading; ithas noth-
ing to do with all the money you
hope to make when you get out of
this place; the answer to all of your
petty probs lies in marijuana.
Imagine, if you will, a typical
Davidson student slaving away
over a tough paper. This requires
time and effort, focus and, inevita-
bly, frustration.
And, as we all know, frustration
can lead to carelessness (or the
over-use of yourrighthand). Most
sentence fragments, comma
splices, and all other horrible syn-
tax errors, can be chalked up to
frustration. Grammatical errors
are the result of not ever realizing
how tense you usually are when
you're writing. Indeed, these feel-
ings can even be caused by writing

By the way .. . all those
commercials you may have seen
showing good kids gone bad, their
poor, young brains frying on the

stove, are justa further example of |

the media’s distortions and half-
truths. That’s not really your
brain—that’s an egg! And if you
could really get high off a stove,
believe us, '‘we’d know about it.
So, kiddies, don’t believe every-
thing you hear on TV.

and embarrassing undergarments

in my life, from: that day on, I’ve

been wearing silk bikini briefs just
like everyone else.

I gained a whole new self
image, and all the confidence
necessary to be a true leader of
society. What did I care what
people thought of me or said
behind my back when I had the
power of individual intimacy?
What did it matter what)my
grades were? Whoneeded girls?

College life has been an abso-
lute joy forme, and I think Iowe
it all to touching myself. I don’t
have to be embarrassed about
how I keep myself warm, be-
cause at a place like Davidson
College, it’s the only sexual
outlet anybody has. It’s not like
I’m the only one not getting any.
Just about everybody at
Davidson plays the pocket pi-
ano every now and then.

The best thing about this place
is that there are so many places
oncampus to just drop my draw-
ers and dance with the jam

master.

Late at night in the 24 hour
room of the library, the empty
rooms of Chambers, the Union
Cafe, my Psychology class, all of
these are great. Heck I even like to

touch o’ Tony at the parties on
Patterson Court. It’s especially
exciting when there are a bunch of
guys lined up on the wall “going to
the bathroom.” How these kids
waste the opportunity on simple
urination. I like to go for the gusto
and truly relieve myself right then
and there.

I seem to be getting a little
carried away here, so I’ ll make this
brief. Reach out and touch your-
self, people, it can change your
world. In the words of Woody
Allen, “don’t knock masturbation.
It’s sex with someone I love.”

DISCLAIMER:

As stated in the photo's cap-
tion, Doug Jobe had absolutely
nothing to do with the authorship
of the preceding article. We just
happened to have the photo lying
around in the office and thought it
was too damned good to go with-
out being published. How it hap-
pened to wind up right smack dab
in the middle of an article about
bedwetting and masturbation is
anybody's guess. Of course, no

‘one on The Davidphonian staff

would ever consider poking fun at
apublic figure like the former SGA
president. We just wouldn't do
that.

Of Course they do! 1
