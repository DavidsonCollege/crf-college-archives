again with Charlie Vance as leader.
From forty to fifty men tried out, among
whom there was some very promising
material. Several trips were planned for
the fall and spring and everyone was
looking forward to a big year.

Both literary societies, the Eu and the
Phi, were going in full swing at this time.
They gave promise of staging lively de-

various kinds..

This was the year of the exciting Hard-
ing-Cox election, when the question of
the League of Nations was one of the
main points at issue.. Davidson had its
share of interest ni this important cam-
paign; the Cox-Roosevelt Club was
formed for the purpose of aiding the
Democratic cause in every way possible.
The club raised a fund of $250 to aid in
carrying on the campaign. All students
who had reached the voting age were

urged to go to the polls.

As usual, this publication was strug-
gling along in financial straits.

the Sophs defeated the Freshmen in their |

basketball game of the present season
| by the one-sided score of 31 to 7. Of
|coures the odds were all in the favor of
; the second year men and the fact that
|the other team had not played together
| tielps to explain the large score piled up
| by the Sophs.

| From the start of the game Weld and
| Calhoun, working automatically, shot ten
| points and with the aid of the captain,
Wilson, made it 14 for the half. The
second half marked the best work of the
|more experienced team. Weld for the
|Sophs outshone all opposition and got
| possession of the ball to shoot or pass it
to some one else in position to shoot. The

was the’first up-set of the season and it
is doubtful if there will be another one
as startling as this throughout the
league.

The only reconciling features of the
game as far as the Seniors were con-
cerned, was the playing of Parker at
guard in the first half and the comeback
staged in the second half by the’ seem-
ingly defeated crew, although it was
futile. All credit was due to the Sophs.
Entering the game against heavy odds
they staged a type of battle that was
not to be denied and although out-played
during the second half almost as much
as they had outplayed their rivals in the
first half, they had sufficient score to give
them the margin of victory.
