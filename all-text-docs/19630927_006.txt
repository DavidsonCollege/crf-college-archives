Rare Bird Finds A Perch
In College’s Biology Dept.

BY BILL FOSTER
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Future pre-med students may have been pleasantly confused for a few moments

when they stepped into the

lab last week. The course was biology, true—but, their

lab instructor was a woman, Miss Anne Shannon Cumming. She is the third woman
ever to embellish an otherwise all-male facalty at Davidson.

The road that she took to ob-
tain her present position as in-
structor in the biology depart-
ment.is an interesting one. Miss
Cumming had a brother who at-
tended school here and through
whom she met Dr. Tom Daggy.
Thinking that through his con-
nections with other biology de-
partments. he might know of a
position that would be available
at some southern school, she
wrote to him.

In hjs reply Dr. Daggy said

that Davidson had a_ position of Agnes Scott College in Deca-
open and advised her to write tur, Ga. After leaving Agnes

SUMMER CONSTRUCTION

Campus summer construction projects ranged from
work at Lake Norman to the additional wing of the Ovens
College Union and paving sidewalks between strategic areas
on campus.

Grover Meetze, director of the physical plant, said that
the improvements on the lake campus have been the “big
push” this summer. New projects include a floating platform
with a diving board, the addition of running water and a
redwood bathhouse equipped with dressing rooms and
showers. .

Another big project has been the new Union’ wing.
According to Meetze, completion is due in November. The
new air conditioned facility will include a consolidated
store (paperback, textbook and student) and an enlarged
game room. This will allow additional space for the cafe-
teria and some private dining rooms.

While these two activities took the prominent position
in summer construction, there were certain other important
projects. The most notable of these projects was the exten-
sive dormitory painting and repair.

Two additional walks have been added between the
Union and Cannon Dorm and the Union and Duke Dorm. In

ton state.”

Miss Cumming’s chief field of
interest is ecology. She began in
embryology but became so en-
grossed in ecology that she ‘just
couldn’t resist it. It sorta took
me.”

Soochan, Korea, which is the
birthplace of Miss Cumming,
provides another clue to her
personality. She has to smile a
bit when she talks of her home

22 months. She hopes eventually

To give the highest college
compliment, Mills is ceol, a
sort of Horatio in reverse,
who protects the town but has
to farm to make a living. And
he quickly confirms many @
freshman’s thoughts that the
town is dead early in the
morning. ...

Except on weekends, when the
folks get paid, and i€ it’s a full
moon—then they are out “climb-
in’ trees.” So there is an extra
man on weekends, Earl Knox, to
dizperse the dogs, drunks and
dawdlers along with Joe Walley,
the boss. and Marvin Honeycutt.
But most of the time it’s quiet,
which is the way Mills likes it.

(They run all night because of a
state law about highway inter-
sections.).

The talk might be speculative,
which is the greatest part of
Davidson's crime. Mills affirms
that 90 per cent of the officers
killed are the results of care-
lessness. If he should discover
a robbery, the thing to do is not
saddle up but. “get behind a
tree and start slingin’ lead.”

Traffic is less speculative.
There is no speed trap in the
town, and Mills believes in a

Club is planning to devote one

Area colleges and civic clubs

ion and newspaper coverage has
been planned.

The YMCA is giving 80 per

the school is donating 20 per

untimely extracurricular use of

instances of such.

extent that the girl was hiding

year, was also high on the poll.
Other frequently requested
flims which the committee
will try to obfein are
“Oceans Eleven,” “High
Noon,” “Gient’” and “ice
Palace.’ “West Side Story”
was a favorite, too, but Freeny
expressed doubt that it would
be available.

In order to show as many of
these films as possible the
schedule has been enlarged.
Movies will be shown Thursday,
Friday, and Saturday, as last
year; in addition a new film will
be booked for Monday, Tuesday
and Wednesday. Freeny stated
that the new schedule would be
continued if the committee got
enough support from the stud-
ént body, both in assistance and
attendance; “the film committee
will respond just as well as the
students respond to the film
committee.”

Freeny pointed out that one
of the committee’s biggest prob-
lems in scheduling is to attain a
proper balance between foreign
and art films, which attract
small audiences, and popular en-
tertainment movies. In an effort
of get bigger audiences, the
film committee is trying to ar-
range to show the art and for-
eign movies in Hodson Hall this
year.

This change of atmosphere,
he said, should improve attend-
ance. Professors and their wives
who are reluctant to attend
movies in the Morrison Room
might not mind coming to Hod-
son Hall. Some of these films
will be shown free of charge,
others will require the regular
admission charge.

‘Acting on the overwhelming
requests for cartoons, the
committee will run more of
them with the features. Road
Runner cartoons are a spec-
ial favorite. The committee
last year gave newsreels e
trial run; but they were not
very successful because they
were usually old. Therefore
newsreels are being discon-
tinued this year. .

Although the committee is
going to try to schedule movies
Monday, - Saturday, it will not
create a conflict in college pro-
ductions. For this reason no

films will be shown during the
Great Issues Program Oct. 3.
And movies will not be shown
most of the Saturdays this se-
mester because of other produc-
tions.

Working in collaboration with
Walter MacDonald, who is in
charge of Great Issues, the com-
mittee may occasionally show, in
addition to the feature, a short
pertaining to the subject of the
Great Issues semester topic.
The purpose will be to create
interest in the lectures. How-

ever this program is still.in the [-—

planning stage.
