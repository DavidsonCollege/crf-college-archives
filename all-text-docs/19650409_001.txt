Visitors To Amherst
Find Life Stimulating

By TED GLUSMAN
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Eight Davidson upper-
classmen gave up their
Spring Vacations last week
to participate in the second
half of Ambherst’s student
exchange program with
Southern colleges.

The eight who visited for a
week in Amherst, Mass., with
side trips to Harvard and other
Northern colleges were John
Barrow, Rick Brand, Danny
Boone, Charlie Dibble, Tom
Frist, David Powell, Ted Pul-

-_ cai liam, and Tommy Heffner.

They were impressed. To a

AAUP Writing Article
On Speaker-Ban Law

The Davidson chapter of the American Association
of University Professors is in the process of preparing

an article on the North Caroli
law for possible publication
nal.

Professor Richard Gift,
chairman of the Davidson
AAUP’s speaker-ban com-
mitee, described the project
as a “scholarly article on
the history and the effects
of the speaker- ban law.” He
said that it was hoped that
this article might appear in
the AAUP journal, but that
this was not a certainty.

Gift added that the speaker-
ban committee was actively en-
gaged in communication with
numerous legislators in an ef-

fort to gain action toward re-.

peal or amendment of the law.

Davidson AAUP chapter Pres-
ident J. H. Oswalt said that
many individual chapters of this
organization throughout the state |
are carrying on similar cam-
paigns and have pledged their)
support to the Davidson chap-
ter.

“The Davidson College chap. ,
ter has been cooperating with
the state AAUP in the matter.”
said Ostwalt, adding that the
state AAUP was sending letters
concerning its stand on the ‘gag
law” to all legislators, and was
making personal contact with}
them whenever possible.

“The situation is in the hands
of the House and the Senate
now,” explained Osbtwalt. ‘‘Sena-
tor Jennings G. King of Scotland
County tells us that he feels the
best tactic to follow is to push
amendments rather than com.
plete repeal. Of course, our posi-
tion favors complete repeal,”’ he
added.

Ostwalt said that tentative
‘gag law’? amendments were in
the hands of Senator King.

When asked what these amend-
ments might entail, Ostwalt ex-
plained that their general thrust

ina Communist Speaker-Ban
in the AAUP national jour-

would be toward giving the state-
supported schools the responsi-
bility of speaker control. At
present, the ‘‘gag law’’ itself is
the sole controlling factor.

Opponents of the law feel. that
some ‘degree of amendment is
favored”in the Senate. but they
are not nearly as certain as to
the position of the House.

Ostwalt noted that though this
issue is no longer headline news
a constant flow of letters to
newspapers throughout the state
from people on both sides of the
debate indicates “‘this is a pret-
ty live issue yet.”

greater involvement of the stu-
dents in the world around them,
and the greater independence
and sense of responsibility
they show. Dibble commented,
“They've got us out-classed in
every respect except—I like a
Southern atmosphere.”

Pulliam added that “they

were more excited about some:

of the things they were learn-
ing.”

MORE INVOLVED

The Ambherst student, they
felt, is involved in civil rights
and social reforms, is more ex-
cited by his studies, and tends
to combine his intellectual life
with his recreation. By and
large, this was attributed to
the rmore relaxed social at-
mosphere there. .

Girls are allowed in the Am-
-herst dormitories and drinking
is allowed on the campus. Add-
ed to this is the fact that some
4,000 coeds at Smith and Mt.
Holyoke Colleges are within
ten miles of the 1.200 Amherst
men, creating a social atmos-
phere that Barrow called
“more conducive to casual re-
lationships than ours.”

Amherst is more varied than
Davidson insofar as types of
students are concerned. Pow-
“They're much
more heterogenous than us."
and called them “guys who
were genuinely interested in
things, and weren't condemned

for it — they weren't called
‘flies’ or anything.”
SELF-CRITICISM

Yet Amherst, with its inte
gration of academic activity
with pleasure and its “melting
pot’ student body, is sharply
self-critical in these two areas.
“They want their Admissions
Department to get more ‘odd-
balls,” more geniuses, more
creative. people,” stated Frist.

DE-EMPHASIZES SIZES FRATERNITIES

By JOE BENTLEY

Staff Writer

The IFC unanimously decided Monday night to
abolish summer rush after a report favoring abolish-
ment had been adopted at the March 22 meeting.

Instead of the individual fraternity summer
rush program, the IFC will be responsible for what-
ever fraternity information incoming freshmen re-
ceive. This information probably will be in three
separate mailings, according to IFC President Fred

Sackett.

The March report stated that “by de-emphasiz-
ing rush and co-ordinating any fraternity activity on
rush through the IFC, much of the emphasis an in-

coming freshman places
avoided.”

on fraternities would be

The report said that the present feeling of rejec-
tion is due largely to the emphasis placed on fra-
ternities before the freshman comes to Davidson and

is some ‘different’ people.’
Secondly, Amherst is  con-
cerned about combining work
and pleasure more successful-
ly. They are critical of what
Barrow called the ‘‘dichotomy
between social and academic
life." But he opined that “‘it'’s
a lot more applicable here than
there,’ and Frist quipped,
“We're so dichot!"” Most of the
eight seemed ‘to feel that Da-

editorships. They are all rising
seniors.

Adair will be in charge of the
new special features page in
future alternate issues which,
according to the new editor,

has no other facilities.

Also passed unanimously by the IFC and pend-
ing faculty approval are proposals to set up minimum
requirements for pledge programs, to formulate ef-
fective IFC scholarship programs, to institute a sec-
ond rush period after Thanksgiving, and to turn the
IFC into a central clearing house for service projects
not only for the pledge class, but also for the entire

fraternity.

Seeing the IFC as moving into a new legislative,
judicial, and regulatory role, rather than a primarily
social one, Sackett said, “I’m especially pleased that
the council is considering basic minimum require-
ments for pledge programs.

tem a much more positive influence on campus while
at the same time benefting all members of the fra-

ternities.”

Action

| Expected To Be Final

The Faculty Committee on Fraternities, Social Life
and Clubs hopes to have a report prepared for submis-
sion to the faculty by its next meeting on Tuesday.

The committee has been meet-
ing regularly since it was as-
signed the task of developing a
recommendation to be present-
ed for faculty action. It was or-
iginally hoped that the report
could be ready for the faculty

| meeting scheduled on April 6.

Due to spring break, during
which time the committee did
not meet, and the large amount
of information it has been nec-
essary to study, Dr. W. G, Mc-
Gavock, chairman of the com-
mittee, asked President Martin
to postpone the meeting until
April 13 so that there would be
additional time for the prepara-
tion of a complete proposal.

McGavock stated that he
“would not be at all surprised

‘‘We are one of the few col-

HODDING CARTER
A “Tale of Two Cities”

By HEYWARD CARTER

Davidsonion Feature Writer

A “Tale of Two Cities”
was the subject of Pulitzer
Prize-winner Hodding Car-
ter's address in chapel to-
day. The cities are Green-
ville and McComb, Miss. The
tale is not a nice one.

The first city, Greenville, is
Carter's home town, where he
{s editor of the Delte Democrat-
Times. In the midst of racial
strife in Mississippi, Greenville
has been somewhat of a pioneer
in peaceful relations in that the
city council has proposed a Ne-
gro for the next vacancy, it was
the first town in Mississippi with
Negro policemen, and it had no
violence and no arrests during

last year’s ‘‘long, hot summer”
and it was the only town in the
deep South whose police chief
and police force was praised by
the NAACP for “fairness and
lack of brutality.”

In the same state lies Me-
Comb, a somewhat smaller town
with a much smaller Negro pop-
ulation. Carter described Mc-
Comb as the “‘center of violence
and unrest bombings" last sum-
mer, which became a “place of
terror’, having ‘‘more burnings,
bombings and beatings than any
town in Mississippi, although
there were no murders.”

McComb was also the scene
of the “running: out-of-town" by
almost complete ostracism of a
well-liked family whose daugh-
ter was the current Miss Missis-

sipp:. The “‘crime’’ which forced
this couple to leave the state
was that they talked to two civil
tights advisers (both white), at
the request of their rector, in an
effort to try to bring the vio-
lence in Mississippi to an end.
They were described by Car-
ter not as radicals, out of place
in Mississippi society. but as
“Mississippi moderates and re-
ligious young people.”

The question which Carter pre-

sented to his audience was
“What is the difference between
a Greenville and a McComb?"’

Some have said that it is the
newspaper, but Carter denies
this saying only that he and his
paper have helped the situation.

The answer according to Car-

ter is the kind of leadership
present in a town willing to ex-
press itself. It is a problem of
noblesse oblige versus falssez
fatre. The Greenville leadership

‘is under the noblesse oblige tra-

dition in that it has ‘‘conserva-
tive men devoted to the com-
munity, men of education who
are at home anywhere and who
are determined to keep a good
town good."

It is this attitude which was
missing in McComb, the editor
stated, and without this attitude
no newspaper can make head-
way against prejudice and cor-
rupt:on.

Carter summed up his pres-

entation by stating that ‘What
I'm plugging is an awareness,
which has become ‘corny’, to
community responsibility. It is
not corny to say that I love my
town and state.”

The final plea for civic and
national leadership was embod-
ied in a quote from an old friend
of Carter's who thirty years ago
persuaded him to settle in Green-
ville:

“Neither you nor I can do
anything on the grand scale, but
we can try to live as men of
good will in Greenville and do
what we can do to make a good
town better because it is the
sum total of towns like Green-
ville that makes a nation better

and the way we want it to be.”

YRC Picks
New Slate
Of Officers

Wednesday night the David-
son College Young Republican
Club met and elected a new
slate of officers and a slate of
delegates to the state conven-
tion in Winston-Salem, May 7,
8, and 9.

This meeting was unusual-
ly quiet and routine, the only
irregularity occurring during
the counting of the votes for
chairman of the club, during
which eight more votes were
noted than there were, accord-
ing to the roll, members pres-
ent. A second voting was
found to be in order.

Elected officers of the club
for the new year are as follows;
Harry McMullan, chairman;
Heyward Carter, vice-chair-
man; Sam Bradley, correspond-
ing secretary; Don McKinnon,
recording secretary; Barry
Bishop, treasurer. Bradley and
Bishop were elected by accla-
mation.

Delegates to the state con-
vention are: John Futch, Steve
Sands, Harry McMullan, Hey.
ward Carter and Sam Bradley.
Joe Obenshain and Roland Eid-
son are first and second alter-
nate delegates, respectively.

A resolution stating that the
Davidson College Young Re
publican Club is in “general
agreement” with the resolution
of the North Carolina College
Council passed October 1, 1964,
supporting the fraternity sys-
tem. was adopted by a 20-16
vote.

A final resolution expressing
appreciation of time and energy
spent on club duties by the re-
tiring group of officers, and a}
vote of gratitude to them for
their fine work during the past

year was passed by acclama-'

tion.

lem) on Tuesday.”

The members of the commit-
tee, in addition to McGavock,
are: Dr. C. G. Davidson, Dr. R.
B. Jaekson, Dr. S. D. Maloney,
Dr. George Labban. Dr. T. F.
Clark, C. S. Smith and Rev. W.
H. Terry along with Dean R. C.
Burts, Assistant Dean R. G.
Jones and Fred Saékett as non-
voting members.

-The committee has agreed to
remain silent until it can come
forth with a single, unified re-
port.

Most of the work done by the
committee has consisted of ana-
lyzing the three reports that
evolved from the Fraternity
Evaluation Committee and stu-
dent and alumni statements.

McGavock emphasized that
committee was concerned with
“the basic philosophy behind
each of the reports’ and that
thus far the study of the three
reports in light of their mo-
tives has been the basis for most
of the discussion in the commit...
tee’s meetings.

McGavock spoke favorably of
both student and alumni re-
sponse to the situation and said
that he felt ‘‘all points of view
have been ably presented” and
that .“’the trend certainly has not
been one-sided."’ Some 26 stu-
dent spoke to the committee and
additional briefs and leters were
read.

“Tom Poore. head uf house
management at Amherst (equiv-
alent to IFC president), went
before the committee for exten-
sive questioning since his col-
lege is involved in a similar con-
troversy.

Alumni reaction to the ques-
tion of fraternities on Davidson's
campus was slow, at first but

|has since picked up and been

very helpful. McGavock stated
that the predominate feeling was
in fayor of maintaining the sta-
tus quo out of fear of destrov-
ing a “good thing.”

But he continued by saying
that there has aiso been much
support for a complete revision
of the system.

The student council poll of the
Student body on the situation
was tabulated, and the result§
were mimeographed and distrib-
uted, along with.a copy of the
questionnaire, to each member
of the committee. This was done
so that each person would have
the various -student opinions in
his possession and be able to
analyze them completely.

The faculty committee is now
in the process of separating and
studying all of the information
at hand. It is taking all of the
pertinent facts and weighing
them against each other.. The
result will be a report for the
faculty to act upon as soon as
possible.
