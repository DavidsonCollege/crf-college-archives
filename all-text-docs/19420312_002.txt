Volunteer Land Corps

Organized to make young people use-
ful who as yet are not called to military
service, this organization, headed by
Miss Dorothy Thompson and Dr. Her-
bert Agar of the Lottszille Courier-
Journal, aims to draw youth from all
parts of the Nation and place them, for
the summer months of the vacation per-
iod, on the farms of Vermont, which
are faced today by a 40 per cent labor
shortage. The workers, both young
men and women of college age, will be
paid $21 a month, and reom-and-board,
the equivalent of a soldier’s pay, and
will be under the supervision of the
farmer with whom they live, the Vol-
unteer Land Corps, and the Agricultural

Consultants representing the govern-__

ment of Vermont.

As Miss Thompson has written, “The
Volunteer Land Corps launches in a
small, intensive way, the movement of
the civilian soldier and defender, ally
of his comrades in arms. lover and work-
er, builder and creator by work and good
neighborliness of the democratic and co-
operttive world of tomorrow.” Aiming
to render service, both to a New Eng-
land country-side badly in need of the
produce of this great farming State, and
to the young workers, most of whom
would never before have chanced at the
great privilege that men enjoy who watch
things grow and reap the harvest, Miss
Thompson is appealing to the youth of
all sections to consider the large advan-
tages in such an enterprise and, if con-
ditions permit, join the_ranks of those
many hundreds who have already sig-
nified their intention of aiding in this

contribution to the welfare of their
Nation.
As to—who may participate, Miss

Thompson tells us “The Corps is open
and welcomes all young men not yet
called to the colors---any man or any
young woman over the age of 16. It
accepts all; it rejects none. Yet it is a
student movement in essence, because it
helieves that the university youth owe
a special service and the duty of setting
‘i special example to the rest of Ameri-
can youth.”

Au Revoir To That Important First
Digit of the Hand

Whteher college students are cog-
nizant of the fact or not, that fate-
ful day of De-
cember 7, 1941,
when the Japan-
ese pulled that
most clever ace
out pf their
bloody. sleeves,
not only serious
military  prob-
lems for F..D.
R., et al, but al-
so an €xtreme-
trensportation “problem
for college-students. We find our-
selves at this point facing a con-
stantly growing enigma.  Prob-
ably none of us realized—that-day
that the attack by-those insidious
Japs was going to cut off our major
supply of rubber from the East
Indies, and thus necessitate the
freezing of the automobile tire busi-
ness.

Rudolph

ly serious

To be specific, let me give an
example from a _ typical
diary: “Thursday, February 26,
1942: Had to go to Charlotte this
afternoon. Was on bumming corner
at 1 P. M. Finally caught ride
with-man-in-a truck at 2:45 P: M.
Came back on bus.’”’ I believe that
this experience is typical of students
in the more or less isolated college
communities similar to Davidson.
The reason I give for saying that
it is a “constantly growing enigma,”
is that Mr. Hendérson of Washing-
ton, has definitely stated that there
is no rubber on hand at present for

student

private consumers, and that there
will not be any for a year or three
or ‘until the war is over. Therefore,
if the problem of bumming is acute
now, think of what) it’s going to be
next year! You underclassmen are
going to be forced to turn in your
thumb for a nice green, fresh bus
or train ticket. Alas! I must re-
tract a statement I made in this
column not Jong ago. I said: “As
long as there is a Charlotte, and
as long’as there is.a Davidson, there
will always be sofneone on the bum-
ming corner.”

That magic word DURATION
comes in at-this point. Everything
has been “suspended for the dura-
tion.” This, I repeat, includes good
and. fruitful hitchhiking. Yes, I
predict a.good future for the South-
ern Rallway and for the Atlantic
Greyhound Corporation. In fact,
if you have some money you want
too invest in-something besides De-
fense Bonds, buy, a little railroad
stock, It will be a good investment
for the “duration.”

What other evidence of this enig-
ma do we have besides the afore-
mention Davidson-Charlotte situa-
tion? Well, there were the David-
son students who were on the corner

“at noon in Charlotte last Friday

trying to bum to Charleston, At
nine o'clock that night they had
reached Orangeburg, S. C. There
they boarded a train for the rest
of ‘their journey. Even during Mid-
winter Dances, one social fraternity
was forced to charter a bus to take
the boys and their dates back and
forth to the dances.
