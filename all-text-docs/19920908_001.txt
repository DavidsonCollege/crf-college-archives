New Alcohol Policy

Causes Confusion on Court

By Tom Koonce and Sean Lind

“Nobody ever thought this was
going to be easy,” said Dean Will
Terry in response to the problems
caused by the new alcohol policy
in just its first few weeks of imple-
mentation.

During the first full weekend
on Patterson Court, twenty-six stu-
dents received alcohol violations.
The widcly-held belicf that 150
people had been given citations
was simply an exaggerated rumor.
Only sixteen of the students who
received citations will appear be-
fore the Alcohol Enforcement
Committec(AEC) for disciplinary
action,

As withany new system, there
has been some confusion. Dean
Terry said, “We are trying to heed
the editorial of The Davidsonian

and are trying to get the kinks out
as quickly as we can.”

Rick Moore, Assistant Direc-
tor of Public Safety, admitted the
implementation of the policy has
difficult and at times confusing. A
problem last weekend was that
many police officers were enforc-
ing some of the rules of the old
alcohol policy, such as not allow-
ing public consumption of alcohol
outside of the court houses.

Originally, it was thought that
the “court” meant only the frater-
nity houses and porches. Now,
however, the definition has been
expanded to include the houses,
sidewalks and the entire lawn of
Patterson Court.

In addition to alcohol moni-
tors andcampus police, the college
has hired thirty part-time officers

College Considers
On-Campus Postal Facility

By Sean Lind
~~“ A proposal has been submit-

ted by the Davidson Post Office to
the Davidson College Office of
Business and Finance for the cre-
ation of a new on-campus “‘con-
tract post office.”

The plan’s objective’s are as
follows:

“To provide on-campus de-
livery-and retail services.

To, accommodate future
growth in present facility.

To provide earlier, more effi-
cient post office box delivery.

’ To provide earlier, more effi-
cient rural delivery:
To provide faster, more effi-
cient window services.
To generate additional rev-

. enue.”

According to the proposal, the
new facility’s advantages will be
manifold. First, the College will
be subsidized by the Post Office to
operate the on-campus site. The
College will own the boxes and
will be able to correspond with
students without charge. Local
advertising rates and rates for

from the Davidson, Huntersville
and Cornelius Police Departments
to help enforce the new policy.
These officers will be responsible
for checking IDs and writing up
violations.

The police officers at the par-
tics work for the Residence Life
Office. Although they might be
officers from various communi-
ties around Davidson, they will
issuc Davidson citations that the
AEC will handle. The policeman
will only issuc a state citation if
students become abusive or
incooperative.

There has also been somecon-
fusion as to whether or not fresh-
men can:attend ‘wet’ parties be-
tween September Sth and October

See "Confusion" on page 4

‘merchant’ s correspondence will be

determined by the college and lo-
cal merchants.

Allservicesoffered atthe town
post office will also be available at
the proposed college facility.

Therumoroncampushas been
that the students were going to be
“kicked out” of the town post of-
fice. Student vandalism and litter-
ing were believed to be the reasons
for the post office’s move.

Menkhaus Aids the United Nations
in Efforts to Resolve Somali Conflict

By Walter Price

Ken Menkhaus, asssistant pro-
fessor of political science at
Davidson, was invited by repre-
sentatives of the Somali govern-
ment to travel to Sweden August
21-23 to aid in attempts to bring an
end to the conflict that presently
ravages the East African country
of Somalia.

Menkhaus was one of a group
of experts asked by Ambassador
Mohamed Sahnoun, special repre-
sentative of the Secretary General

of Somalia, to attend the United
Nations conference to discuss the
Somali crisis. The group met in
order to discuss-the problems fac-
ing the country and develop a plan
of action for the U.N.

According to Menkhaus, the
situation is one of “complete anar-
chy” since the January 1991 fall of
the Somali government. As a re-
sult of the government instability,
the conditions were “ripe” for a
famine that Menkhaus described
as “worse than that in Ethiopia in

1985.”
“The U.N. has never beén~
faced with a situation like this one

“in Somalia. It is fundamentally

different. The U.N. is premised on
the assumption that there is a gov-
emment to deal with, but this isn’t
the case in Somalia. Generally the
U.LN.’sroleis to ensure and respect
the sovréignty of a nation while
lending aid, but this isn’t the sce-

nario.in eas said.

Spencer House Reluctantly Closes Doors

By Christopher Edwards

Many members of the
Davidson community were sur-
prised by the recent decision to
close Spencer House at the begin-
ning of this semester. Its closing
leaves Warner Hall, Rusk and
Connor as the three remaining
women’s eating houses on
Patterson Court.

Spencer was founded seven

years ago as the third women’s
eating house on Patterson Court.
Successful for many years, Dean
Will Terry said the house’s closing
“had been coming on for [the
past] year.” The opening of Connor
House and the high number of
Spencer members on JYA for the
1992-93 school year resulted in
low membership levels and result-
ing financial difficulties for the

eating house. Davidson College

administrators actually began dis-

cussing the house’s problems last,
fall.

In a letter published in the
August 31 Davidsonian, former
Spencer House President Zama
Neff stated that the women of Spen- _
cer were “saddened to realize

library collectionas
thoroughly. as does

she.” Beaty always

gave her fullandun-

even those who just

needed help getting

acquainted with the

sorE.A. Beaty and Margaret Clark
