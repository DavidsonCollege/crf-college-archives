Headlining the News April 9-15

Across the World: A hijacked Kuwaiti jet
flew from Larnaca airport in Cyprus to
Algiers, Algeria Wednesday in the latest
development of an eleven-day ordeal. The
Boeing 747 was intercepted April 5 on its
way from Bangkok, Thailand to Kuwait.
The six to eight hijackers are believed to be
Shiite Moslems. They are demanding that
Kuwait release 17 “pro-Iranian” terrorists
who were convicted December 1983 for
bombings on that island. Approximately
100 passengers were originally on board the
plane--57 were released in Mashhad, Iran
on the Sth; 12 were released the 13th as a
condition for the plane to continue to Algi-
ers. Three members of the Kuwaiti ruling

family were reported to still be on board the
plane by one of the freed hostages. Two
Kuwaiti hostages were killed on Sunday
and Monday; their bodies were dumped
from the plane in Larnaca. The PLO has
attempted to negotiate terms of release for
the hostages along with the Kuwaiti and Al-
gerian governments.

A U.S. Navy ‘woman was one of five
persons killed by acar bomb set off Thurs-
day in front of a club for U.S. military
personnel in Naples, Italy. The bombing
occured around 2 p-m EDT. There were
approximately 60 people in the club. Most
escaped injury because they were in the
basement of the building. The bomb was in
a parked car and the explosion caused sev-
eral other cars to catch fire. Four people on

the street were instantly killed; several
other pedestrians were injured. The other
sailors killed were Italian. American naval
presence in Naples is large, as it is the
headquarters for NATO’s southern com-
mand andas wellasa fleet station. No group
has claimed responsibility for the crime.
Across the Nation: Democratic candi-
dates held one of a series of presidential
debates April 12th at New York’s Madison
Square Garden in preparation for the vital
April 19th New York primary. Albert Gore
Jr. of Tennessee, Massachusetts governor
Michael Dukakis, and the Reverend Jesse
Jackson are each vying for a majority of the
state’s 255 delegates in a primary which
could very much decide the frontrunner for
the Democratic ticket nomination. The 90-

minute debate included discussion on the
United State’s policy towards the Middle
East—especially Israel—welfare, educa-
tion and AIDS.

The United States is optimistic that an
agreement by Soviets to withdraw from
Afghanistan will be longstanding. The
document was signed on the 14th by the
Soviets in Geneva in an end to a nine-year
war, Secretary of State George Schultz
represented the U.S. at the signing. The
withdrawal is the first for the Soviets from
a territory which it has occupied. 150,000 -
troops are to leave beginning May 15. Al-
though the signing is perceived as a step
towards peace in Afghanistan, both the U.S.
and the Soviet Union have stated that they
will continue to supply arms to the factions.
