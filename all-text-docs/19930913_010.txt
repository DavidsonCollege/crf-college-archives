As I See It

THE DAVIDSONIAN — OPINIONS MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 1993

A special thank you to a permanent fixture in Davidson life

This week I am sad to report
the passing of another Davidson
classic. Inacouple weeks Norton’s
Barber Shop, which has been a
fixture in downtown Davidson
since 1912, will close down.

Mr. Norton is retiring to do
the things he loves, like spending
time with his grandchildren and
working with the Boys Scouts of
America.

I understand why Mr. Norton
is retiring, but I hate to see him go.
In fact, most éveryone hates to see
him go. You see, Mr. Norton is
more than just a barber; he is a part

of life in Davidson. For example,
Sandy Carnegie, former head of
the Wild Cat Club, gets his haircut

Tom
Norwood

at Norton’s. He used to take his
son, Sandy Carnegie Jr., to
Norton’s. Today, Sandy Carnegie
Jr. takes his son, Prosser, to get a
haircut at Norton’s.

Three generations of

Carnegies have gone to Norton’s
to get a haircut, and to hear a story
or two.

I didn’t grow up in Davidson,
but I’ve been going to Norton’s for
two years now. I don’t know what
I’m going to do when he retires.
Mr. Norton found a replacement,
but Joe Poteat, who owns the build-
ing, decided to turn the Barber
Shop into a gnome shop.

Great, that’s all downtown
Davidson needs: another gnome
shop. I could go to Pott’s Barber
shop in Cornelius. Pott’s is like the

- barber shop in the movie “Coming

To America.” (“ Joe Lewis was
the greatest fighter of all time!”)
Everyone is constantly jabbering,
and you’ ll probably get a headache
as well as a haircut.

Norton’s is much more laid
back. You just sit down and talk
aboutanything thatison yourmind.
Or you might hear one of Norton’s
world famous stories.

Ilove to hear about his grand-
children, and how his garden is
doing. When he’s done, you pay
him $6 plus a dollar or two tip, and
head towards the door. Just before
you get to the door you will hear

those familiar words, “Call again.”
In a few weeks there will nothing
left of the barber shop buta memo-
rial in the side walk which reads
“NORTON BARBER SHOP IN
HONOR OF HOOD AND KEN
NORTON 1912-1993”

It is impossible for me to do
justice to what Mr. Norton has
meant to me and to the people of
Davidson. He is a barber, a story-
teller, a listening ear, and a friend.
One thing I do know is that the
people who know him will never
be the same. Thank you, Mr.
Norton.

Sleepyhead

By Tony Tuntasit

I used to fake sleep in Mrs.
Kubicki’s kindergarten class. I
would lie in my green mosquito
mesh cot in the basic five year old
fetal position: turned on my right
side, legs splayed in every which
direction, eyes squeezed tight ex-
cept for the occasional peek at
Heather Green, and arms resting
comfortably in a cubby. I pre-
tended to be asleep because I re-
membered that the American Medi-
cal Association recommends that
a healthy normal five year-old
should get at least twenty minutes
of fake sleep per day and that |
couldn’t go to recess if I didn’t
pretend. Nowadays I act as if
“Monopoly Supply Curves” are

actually holding my attention when
I’m actually hoping to hop back
into bed. So to alleviate this situ-
ation, I propose that Naptime 100
(Slumber 201 for those with AP
Credit) should be added to the
Davidson curriculum. Imagine
seeing this report card:

Anthropology 101

B- 2.70

Biology 112

B+ 3.30

Sociology 101

C 2.00

Slumber 201

A++*f ; . 5.00

* Tony is an exceptiona
sleeper.

tHe snores though.

Sleepiness is the one of the top
causes of lost time among college
students second only to death by
otters. Last year about 1.43 billion
hours of prepaid schooltime was

lost by students who simply woke
up and said “Boy, I’d like to go to
Chemistry 301 today but I’m just
too darn (yawn)
sleepy... SNNNNKXTT...” Lack
of sleep affects all college students
but it is especially rampant among
the freshmen halls because fresh-
men havea very dulled concept of
sleep management. Thus fresh-
men are always looking for some-
thing to do at very dumb hours of
the night. Here is the typical daily
freshman schedule of things to do:
9:00am

Wake up.

10:00am-11:00pm

Miscellaneous/nothing.

11:05pm

Kick soccerball in hall.

11:09pm

Kick soccerball through

window.

11:09pm-12:00am

Throw frisbee in hall.

12:00am-1:00am

Throw football in hall.

1:00am-2:00am

Throw geek in hall.

2:05am-3:00am

Pull fire alarm. Accidently

of course.

3:00am-9:00am

Sleep.

I’d have to admit though that
my sleepings are not of a respon-
sible collegian either. My late
nights are often divided between
those silly talk show guys Dave,
Jay, Arsenio, Chevy, Beavis,
Salaman, Ralph, and Bill. ButI’ve
alleviated my deprivative sleeping
patterns by taking the periodic
power nap throughout the day. The

Oriinowed Dy Troune Mens Services

power nap was originated by the
Ancient Spaniards who livedaland
called Espafiards.

They, too, suffered from alack
of sleep due to exciting late night
talk show wars (The Catholic vs.
The Protestants) and thus began
the tradition of taking a siesta (de-
rived from the Spanish word sies
meaning six) during the afternoon
so they could continue watching
the melee.

I think that the Spaniards are
ontosomething. If we don’t get to
sleep as an elective, Davidson
should at least institute the
Davidson siesta, a mandatory pe-
riod of nappage during the day.
Imagine the national publicity, the
outpouring of endowments, the
accolades, and the increased en-
rollment. : .

I can hear the trustees gig-
gling right now. I’dlike to tell you
more about this pinnacle of inno-
vation but I’m tired. And I’m
going to take a nap.

Now, tell me, exactly what is he talking about?

Rude continued from page 9

to reach full scale rambling.

OK. While we are on the topic
of parties and how lame this cam-
pus is getting, I want to remind
everyone that school is not just a
time for studying. Now, I can hear
themembers of the Executive Com-
mittee saying, “Great, this kid
hasn’tlearned a thing aboutschool.
He’s still immature and he’s not
taking responsibility for his ac-
tions.” But that’s not true.

Never forget that, unfortu-

nately, you are here first and fore-
most as a student. However, be-
sides studying, part of being a “well
rounded student” is being social
and going out, and going to the
Outpost at eleven o’clock doesn’t
count unless you are as drunk as a
wombat. (Do wombats drink? If
they do, they’re cool.)

You know as I write I begin to
understand that this little column
is not really designed for older

people. I mean let’s face it, by the

time you are thirty, basically all
you have going for you is a the fact

Editor's note: Do not pull fire alarms.
If you do you won't earn your core requirements.
Only pull a fire alarm if there is a fire.

that your kids may get in trouble
with the law in the future and you
can live vicariously through all of
that.

So keep that in mind and go
out and piss the RLO Office (re-
dundant) off, because if you don’t,
the most exciting part of their day
is replacing light bulbs in the bath-
room and maybe catching a glimpse
of a little tush.

I guess that is the end of this

' weck’s little rambling deal. Sojust:

go out and do your part and get
drunk and throw up on some other
hall than you live on and while you
are running out the door, pull the
fire alarm. But, no matter what,
don’t forget to take your core re-
quirements.

You and me and MTV

By Holley Wilson

You like MTV. Shutup, don’t
deny it.

Okay, here, I’1l help you out
with this little bit of self-examina-
tion. Let’s make this a group con-
fessional. I like MTV. In fact, I
adore it. I am writing this while
firmly planted in a La-Z-Boy in a
beer-can-strewn living room
watching, for the third time since
Thursday, the Tenth Annual MTV
Music Awards. Wow.

At what other formal awards
ceremony can the winners slouch
up to accept their awards dressed
worse than I am on Sunday morn-
ing, armed with acceptance
speeches suchas “Best Hard Rock?
IThought We Were Grunge” (Pearl
Jam), and “Thanks for the Space
Guy” (Stone Temple Pilots)?

Where else could Madonna
and Janet Jackson perform acts on
stage that our parents were warned
would lead them straight to un-
wanted pregnancy, not to mention
Hell? Award presenter Snoop
Doggy-Dogg turned himselfin two
days after the ceremony as an ac-
complice in a gang-related mur-
der.

And thousands upon thou-
sands of the young, beautiful, and
certifiably cool rallied to support a
fat, bespectacled little girl in a bee
suit tap dancing, for crying out
loud. Isthe Bee Girl our new Muse
of Hipness?

Well, I’dsay the Music Revo-
lution is pretty much over. My
mother, no doubt, would take one
look at these glimpses of Planet
MTV and be horrified. “A fine
advertisement for the youth of to-
day,” she’d say, “I’m cancelling
the cable subscription.”

But I don’t think God, in His

infinite wisdom created MTV for
my mother. If He did, I’d find it
concrete proof that He has one hell
of a sense of humor. Nope, MTV
was put here on this fine planet just
for you and me. That’s how Iknow
you like it.

But my ultimate point here is
that MTV in all of its self im-
pressed, shallow opulence is still
the hallowed touchstone of our
generation. Why do we laugh at
“Beavis and Butthead?” Because
they are rathercomplimentary cari-
catures of our apathetic, ignorant,
pyromaniacal selves.

Onasomewhat less self-abas-
ing note, don’t you feel even the
tiniest bit of pride swelling in your
heart when you hear that the ’92
Presidential Election had the high-

" est young voter turnout ever?

“Rock the Vote.” Enough said.

An interesting thing to note is
that the MTV generation is actu-
ally old enough tovote. Look back
at the impact we had on the ’92
election. Look around at all of us
flannel wearin’, body-piercin’,
Lollapaloozers. Think of how
much fun we could have. Think of
how much damage we could do.

That translates into responsi-
bility. The future is, believe it or
not, falling into our hands. We
need to understand our own goals
and values as a generation.

The media is a good monitor
of the collective state of mind.
MTV is, if nothing else, a monitor
at which you can glance and see
what the Twentysomethings are
up to this week.

Also, if you wait long enough,
a good Pearl Jam video will come
on, and then you can drool over
Eddie Vedder. You like Eddie
Vedder. Don’t deny it.
