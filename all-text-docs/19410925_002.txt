it. As there is such a large number, of stu-|

dents in your class, many. of you should
be experienced in writing for school news-
papers, and it is you whom the DAVID-

SONIAN especially wants. However, those
who have had no stich experience need not

Indirectly, you may serve the paper by read- |,

you dislike. Talking behind the DAVIDSON-
TAN’S back is not a good policy. It gets you

You are the men who

during the next four years, and it is up to
you to accept our challenge that you do as
much as possible while-you are here on David-
son’s campus. Go out and excell in athletics,
‘publication work, and other extra-curricular
activities. Make your campus life well round-
ed, but do not neglect your books. You can
make ‘news for the DAVIDSONIAN only
while you are here at Davidson, and there
is no doubt but that you will be here only
so long as ‘you keep up: with your studies.
Class of 1945, we congratulate you on
choosing Davidson for your Alma Mater. You
will never regret it, and the DAVIDSONIAN
hopes to add further enjoyment to your col-
lege days. Again, welcome! And good luck!

“Navy Blues Sextet.”

This production is perhaps the
funniest thing that has hit the

sereen in quite a few months, with
Jack Oakie and Martha Raye get-
ting off laughs for all. As the title
suggests, the U. S. Navy serves as
a background for the many eventful
happenings which befall Oakie. The
plot concerns a burch of crackpots
who practically sabotage the entire
Navy. Sheridan furnishes the glam- |
our and, “what-have-you" to the!
production, and the beautiful “Navy |

ing selections. All in all, “it is top-|
flight entertainment for everyone.
