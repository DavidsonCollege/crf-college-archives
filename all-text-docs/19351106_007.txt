Rumor Indicates That ‘“Stone-
wall Jackson” Taught Math
For Short Time

SERVED IN EMERGENCY

His Brother-in-Law Was Profes-
sor D. H. Hill

Unverified tradition holds that the fa-
mous General of the Southern Confeder-
acy “Stonewall” Jackson for a short time
held the math classes of Professor D. H.
Hill on the Davidson Campus. This
rumor has not been proved but the fol-
lowing facts are known to be true:

“Major” Hill was the Professor of
Math at Davidson from the spring of
1854 through 1859. At the time that
“Major” Hill became a member of the
Davidson faculty there was no president
and the faculty ruled the student body
with an “iron hand.” Hill promoted the
demerit system which was in favor with
the Trustees. He did not gain favor in
the sight of the Davidson Students who
called him “Old Major.”

Rev. Drury Lacy accepted the seat of
the presidency of the College in 1855.
From then until 1859 when ‘he became
persuaded to resign on the force of im-
pending National Conflict to become Com-
mandant of the Charlotte Military Insti-
tute.

“Stonewall” Jackson and Major Hill
became brothers-in-law when they mar-
ried daughters of Robert Hall Morrison,
once President of Davidson. Jackson and
his wife visited in the home of his sister

Pastor’s Enthusiastic Delivery
Appeals To Students

On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thurs-
day of last week Rev. Peter Marshall of
Atlanta, Ga., conducted the annual fall
services speaking at the extended chapel
periods and at voluntary evening vespers.

the stnudents found Mr. Marshall's mes-
sages both inspiring and hetpful. Draw-
ing from exceedingly varied subjects, he
succeeded in presenting an attractive and
informative series, and his delivery en-
hanced the impression of his words.

Mr. Marshall has been popular with
young people because of his enthusiasm,
and last year during a visit to Davidson
he .was_ well the
of two meetings. Last week he spoke six
times in the auditorium and appeared be-
fore open forum groups in the Social
Center, Certain students assisted in lead-
ing the services and prayers.

Mr. Marshall made his introductory
address the of “Doubting
Thomas” and the modern scepticisin of
today. Like Thomas we will not believe
except we see. Mr. Marshall showed that
the truth,
spiritual insight is not ‘gained by anyone
without in
Christ Jesus.

“Believing By Night” was the topic of
the Tuesday evening lecture. The various
references to Nicodemus in John’s gospel
were cited in which John-speaks of Nico-
demus as the man who came to Jesus
hy night. Man receives a far better reve-
lation at night after the, business and du-
ties of the day are over. The only draw
back in Nicodemus’ belief was his reluc
tance to testify openly, At the death of
Jesus he must have felt chagrined be-
cause it was too late. The appeal to stand
out for Christ is given to us also as He
suffers again for our sins.

shall took the John 12 de

took place on Calvary, and he pleaded
that all present would consider Jesus as
master.

Wednesday night the sermon was based
on the open secrets of Christianity, the
open secrets that anyone may learn. The
knowledge of God which is an unknown
thing to unbelievers can be understood
satisfactorily. The secret of God's love
is better’ known if a person avails him-
self of the opportunity. The third open
secret is that of the cross. It is a mystery
that can be solved if man sets out to find
the answer. There are many Christians
who do not attempt to add to their mean
ing by taking the step necessary. Man
must take advantage of what God is will-
ing to reveal after belief is evidenced.

This talk was centered about these three
questions in man’s mind, God, His love,
and the Cross. The theme resembles the
thought perception given
Tuesday morning. The subject is one to

on spiritual
remember, one that will assuredly stick
in the minds of the listeriers.

On the last morning Jesus as a great
doctor was discussed. Mr. Marshall start

Dr. Gregory Waicott Speaks At
Davidson On ‘Philosophy
and Common Sense’”’

Dr. Walcott,

livered a lecture on Philosophy in Cham-

Dr. Walcott chose as his subject for
the address “Philosophy and Common
Sense.” He pointed out that most people
do not see any connection between philos-
ophy and common sense. There are, he
said, two meanings for common sense. In
one way it is taken to mean a sort of
sixth coordinating sense, which is a facul-
ty of a normal person, Aristotle thought
of it in this manner. On the other hand it
may be taken as a social consciousness.
That is a group where the people all have
the same ideas.

Dr. Walcott proceeded to explain that

the common sense of another. He illus
trated this by the idea of evolution, which
was considered philosophy a few years
ago but is now considered common sense.
| Aristotle, one of the first philosophers,
}mapped out the field of knowledge into
various sciences. Now, philosophy looses
one phase after another which will be no
longer called philosophy but will be called
}a science itself. There has lately arisen
a question of what is left in philosophy
since so many of its fields have become
