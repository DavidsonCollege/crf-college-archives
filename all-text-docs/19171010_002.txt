If not, a fine treat of thirty minutes is
missed. Nothing keeps up colloge
spirit more than getting together and
singing snappy, college songs of senti-
ment and victory. There is an inkling
that a new song will be practiced soon
There is a need that these songs—old
and new—hbe sung, and sung with a zest.

Interesting, forceful, appealing and to
the point is the nature of the sermons
Dr. Richards has been preaching since
college opened. At the Sunday morning
service he brought a “Plea and an Argu-
ment,” the plea being that one make the
Commandments of God the rule of their
life. And this rule to be followed stead-
fastly and consistently. The argument
was that it was both profitable and prac-
tical to adopt the Commandments as the
rule of life.

The appeals seem to increase in earn-
estness and forcefulness from Sunday to
Sunday. Such sermons to college men
would be difficult to duplicate.

“Wide is the range of language; and
such words
As one may speak, another may return.”
—Homer.

Tf your paper is late again this week.
as it was last, please bear patiently with
us (as we should do with the express
company) for parcels are so congested in
the Charlotte office that we cannot get
them from the publisher as we should.
However, we hope that arrangements
have been made for better service.

vocabulary.

The Magazine has adopted a new sys-
tem of editing the literary publication
of the student body. ‘This system is com- 7
posed of an editorial board and report- J. L. RT Fee AN ENDE AVOR

ers’ staff similar to the organization of
‘Eng Davivsonian. An account of
this change and a statement of the pur-
pose of this publication is printed in this
issue. ‘l’his, in our estimation, will work
admirably, for a writer can often write
something which is assigned to him,
when otherwise he would not call upon
his creative faculty for a story, poem,
essay, or any form of literature. We
congratulate them for adopting this new
system and feel sure that the editor will
give us a high-grade magazine—which is
the standard here.

At the Christian Endeavor Society.
Sunday evening, J. L. Fowle, ‘18, made
a very interesting and helpful talk on
“Christ's Yoke.” Mr. Fowle spoke of
how everyone must wear a_ yoke. “Tf
one does not wear the yoke of Christ the
Devil will have one ready for him.”
The speaker made a strong appeal to all
the boys to take Christ’s yoke upon them
because He would help them bear their
load and to lead pure lives.

PEP MEETING HELD

WHEAT. LAST WEDNESDAY NIGHT

The State Council of National De-
fense has adopted a unique scheme in
which college men can take part. This
part is to help mould public opinion in
regard to creating whatever interest we
can wherever we can in regard to the
larger acreage for wheat. College men
can do this in many ways. One way is
to tell about the need, for surely with
access to reports and magazines which
are universally distributed the college
man can obtain facts not accessible to
the farmer the country over. Those
who live on the farm can write opti-
mistically about the return in the spring
and that “Plant all you can, I will be
there for saving it.”

Dr. Martin in his appeal before the

Last Wednesday night a rousing
“pep” meeting was held in Shearer Hall
to show the football team that the stu
dent body was behind them in the foot-
ball game with State College. The col-
lege yells, led by “Amo” Love, were
given for the team and for individual
players. After these had been given sev-

praise of the team.

agriculturists buy their commercial ferti-
lizers early and have them moved early.
There are two reasons for this: later,
they will be relatively higher in price
and transportation facilities will be les-
sened. Let us do our bit in response to
