Comment Favorable To
Recent Spring Services

Cutting into the heart of the stu-
dent body, The Davidsonian has at-
tempted to print a cross-section
view of student opinion concern-
ing the Spring Services which ter-
minated Wednesday. Below are the
results:

ERIC CLARK

“Having the different ministers
in dormitory discussion groups this
year has given everyone a better
chance to participate in Spring Ser-
vices. It has given all participants
some real thoughts on basic. Chris-
tian philosophy.”

CHARLIE NORWOOD

“Our enthusiasm in religion runs
in a kind of cycle—from high to
low. Naturally, then, we need an
experience from time to time to
raise this enthusiasm, The Spring
Services has been that kind of ex-
perience for me.”

DICK SOWERBY

“In my opinion the most inter-
esting topic of discussion i the
classification and connecting of cer-
tain conflicting ideas presented in
the Bible.”

MAC McLEAN

“The addition of the preacher-
in-the-dorm method in the Spring
Services has made the three day
period much more fruitful than in
former: years.”

TOM LIGON

“The counselors and bull sessions
in the dormitories were a welcomed
aid in finding the answers to ques-
tions which had arisen before and
during the Spring Services. I hope
that this will act as a precedent
-and that these groups will be con
tinued from year to year.”

STUART PLUMMER
“This year’s Spring Services have
been a profoind ‘joy and inspira-
tion to me. I have received a ful-
ler understanding of Christian faith
and Christian witness.”
DAVE HAMILTON

“The discussion groups in the
dorms let you get your questions
out into the open ‘instead of mum-
bling ‘Oh, Yeah?’ at a distant pul-
pit. Nobody's trying to shove any-
thing down your throat.”

PHIL MITCHELL

“These Spring Services with the
discussion groups in the dorms are
camong the best and most thought-
provoking things that have hap-
pened during my stay at David-
son.”

CHARLIE HAWKINS

“I think the Spring Services are
among Davidson's best traditions.
Not only are they timely, but some-
thing every student can take part in
and benefit from.”

FRANK SHAW

“| believe that the hall discus-
sions have helped to develop and
strengthen our beliefs by discus-
sing and solving those problems
which deal with our everyday li!

HERMAN BELL

“Some people can live in prayer
and yet hesitate ,to boast that
they're totally Christian, because
they can’t honestly prove it.

Is it better (1) to hide this un-
certain position and to give the
world the impression that we are
sure Christians, or (2) to be per-
fectly frank, not to assume any
‘blessed assurance’ we haven't got,
and to let any interested person
know that our Christian faith is
a calculated risk based ,on exper-
ience and evidence?

* Some say that doubts are a man’s
personal problem, that voicing them
weakens other Christians, Dr. Mof-
fett’s theory is that being perfectly
honest with ourselves aitd all in-
terested is the best way to grow
and is our most effective Christian
witness.”

MAC DOUBLES

“Although I was dubious about
the possibilities when first told that
a preacher would stay in our room,
I can say honestly now that IJ
would not exchange these past few
days for anything which has hap-
pened to me in recent years.”

Student Union Plans
Finally Completed

Architect’s plans for Oven’s Stu-
dent Union will be ready by the
end of this month. Plans, permit-
ting the contractors Thompson and
Street to proceed with prepara-
tion of steel, will be in hand this
week,

It is’ expected that construction
can begin by July 1. It will re-
require six to eight months for the
work, unless there are unexpected
delays.

A comntittee of Faculty mem-
bers and upperclass students is be-
‘ing appointed to consult with ref-
erence to detailed planning of the
building, uses of same, and study
of personnel to be employed when
construction is completed.

The. architect is Mr. Michael M.
Hare of New York. He is retained
by the Student Union Association
of America and is familiar with
the best procedures in Unions for
various types of institutions. Super-
vising the plans is Mr, Porter
Butts of the Wisconsin Union and

‘Don Grease Paint

For Frolic Foolies

Perhaps the high spot of the year,
so far as entertdinment goes, is
the annual D-Club Foolies, an oc-
casion which gives Davidson ath-
letes a chance to take off their
gym trunks and uniforms, and don
a little greasepaint instead. This
year, the Foolies will be held on the
Friday night of Spring Frolics,
April 7 to be exact, and the boys
are now hard at work preparing
songs and dances, acts and stunts
wtih which to entertain the spec-
tators, and maintain the high repu-
tation which the Foolies has ac-
quired over the years.

Director Auburn Lambeth, with
assistants Bill Trotman, Bob Gay,
Ham Wade, and Wood Leach, was
quite high in his praise of the fine
cooperation and spirit evidenced
among the cast. Each night, the
boys get together to rehearse and
re-hash songs and dances and dia-
logue in preparation for the big
event.

One evening this week, your re-
porter was given a chance to be
present at a sneak rehearsal of
the event, Such oldies as “God Old
Sumertime,” “Carolina in the Morn-
ing,” “On the Banks of the Wa-
bash,” “Swanee,” and many, many
more were emanating from one cor-
ner of the room, while in another,

son were kept busy quipping back

This society recognizes outstand-

session of such personal character-

fession. At the same time it seeks
to recognize extraordinary accom-

honorary degrees to those clected

It was by this token that Alpha

to Dr. Sparrow the honorary mem-

lege, and took his graduate work
in medicine at the ‘University of

endeared himself to the hearts of

munion held in six years in Cham-
bers Auditorium will be served at

son and Schenck of the Bible De-
partment and the session of Dr.

Church.

Answering student requests and
in realization of Dr. Cunningham’s
hope, plans were laid for a com-
munion service last year, but nev-
er carried to completion.

John Lyles, local YMCA secre-
tary, seemed to think this would
be the last service of its kind ever
held in Chambers due to the new
church's being ready for worship
services in the near future.

attending the service to be in their
seats promptly. ‘“Reverence upon en-
tering and leaving the sanctuary
is necessary,” he observed.

with the Chapel Choir in provid-
