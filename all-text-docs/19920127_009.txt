Let it Snow, Let it Snow, Won't You Just Please Let it Snow

It snowed back home once--
actually, more than once, but it’s
snowed so close to once back home
that I feel entitled to that modifier-
-and then half-melted and then re-
froze and Ted wanted to go sled-
ding. Ted was a questionable char-
acter. Slight, blond, and sinister,
he exihibited by the age of eleven
a vivifying’ inclination to call
Mother Nature to the carpet, to
confront the Elemental, to, at the
risk of introducing what should be
a cliché, Sled On Ice Down A
Narrow. Sidewalk Slap Into A 4-
Way Stop.

Toreiterate, things melted and
re-froze. The walkway running
alongside the steepest hill in the
neighborhood offered up a translu-
cent, frictionless plank tothe waxed
runners of Ted’s flexible flyer; and
Ted was maniacal. He once, just
for the hell of it, removed all four
nuts from the bolts which held the
wheels on his bicyle and took off
down hill, wondering how long it
would take things to unfasten. We

worshipped Ted; and several of us
walked onto the plank and felldown
just to demonstrate how deliciously
slick everything was.

There were hats and gloves in
the audience, some mittens; we all
sported surprisingly puffy coats
which might have elicited an easy
feeling of conscientious warmth in
a viewer had our gathering been a
painting, though we, in the time
honored tradition of Southerners
in the presence of frozen water,
remained quite cold.

Ted wore shorts--his cut-off
corduroys--one-time maroon crea-

* tions that had faded into a sort of

tired out earth tone. He wore high-
top Keds (no socks), a long under-
wear top which he found unspeaka-
bly cool, and an old Atlanta Braves
plastic, blue and white, ugly, use-
less in any situation involving
impact, and fake batting helmeton
which he had painted slogans like
“Brain Bucket’, “Contents Flam-
mable”, and“KISS are people too.”

Craziness In Memphis, Hard Luck Stories From

Now, some of you might be
thinking, “Hey, where were the
: Birks last weekend?” And itis true
that for a period of about three
days, we were unable to fulfill our
numerous,,;social, commitments.
. The court probably seemed a little
bit duller, the Pterodactyl Club a
little bit emptier without our win-
some personalities. Oh, well...
there’s always next weekend, No,
in fact that period was our chance
to get away, as it were, and reflect
on what a boring mob of Crew-
clad cretins you guys really are.
OK, we’ll guess, what did ya’ Il
do this weekend . .. drink beer and
hook? Yep, we thought so. Well,
we got drunk and hooked WITH
WOMEN in the home of the Blues
(and you thought this dump was
givin’ youthe Blues). That’ sright,
Memphis. The Jewel of Ole Man
ee ; ie

they tsa bigiven. Pi ihe maihe-
maticians among you, that’s about
620 hard miles of road between
Cornelius and the delta. There,
aren’t you impressed?

This was what the beer-swill-
ing frat boys calla road trip and
what we called a sojourn. Rising
from the early morning mist of
western Tennessee we found acity
of such decadence and sin they
should have called it Gomorrah.
Really though, there was a movie
theater with 44 screens right down
the street from our hotel. Oppor-
tunities like that only come once in
a lifetime and we managed to see
every .one of those films even
though the theaters themselves
were tiny and (trust us) you don’t .
want to touch the walls,

_ And speaking of our hotel.
Perhaps you’ve heard of the His-
- toric Peabody Hotel (that “historic”
thing always gets tacked on, some-
thing like the “historic” Carter/

No,no..
opulence of therooms

Sadat/Begin debacle), Well, they
charged “historic” prices, like it
was still the eighties or something.
Can you believe, 184 bucks anight
foraroom? Lucky theDavidsonian
creditrcard-was:just:laying there
last Friday; sure was
nice of yousuckers to

far, one which he was never with-
outinamomentof glory, was what
he called his ‘Bert Shirt. His par-
ents, ex-hippies turned I can’t

David Scott

remember what, but they weren’t
hippies anymore, had given this
shirt to their son I think to evoke

to which we refer. We’ll call him
Dave T., for lack of a more appro-
priatename. Dave T.cameup tous
on the street (right outside of the
Historic Peabody) and asked us for
two to three dollars, American

the unhinged gates of their minds
for their repressed neighbors. It
consisted of a white t-shirt with a
picture of Albert Einstein’s head
(or at least his hair, I definitely
remember that hair in motion when
the front wheel finally did come
off) emblazoned on the front anda
quote on the back that read some-
thing like, “Throughout history
great spirits have always suffered
opposition from mediocre minds.”
I sometimes wonder if Ted’s par-
ents didn’t regret their choice as
their son’s eyes suggested a down-
ward glance when they asked him

~ where he was going with that tool-

box, that sled-wax, that thing which
usually belonged to them.

Ted turned his batting helmet
backwards. Several who watched
touched their woolen knit hats with
their hands. I know I fingered the
tiny shag pom-pom attached to the
top of my own head and the hairs
on my neck stiffened. Ted locked
his bare hands onto the boards three
quarters up the length of his flyer

runalong to get something to drink
ourselves! But never fear, we
hadn’t seen the last of Dave T.
Anyway, after we parted ami-
cably from Dave we went out to
Beale Street, the real home of the
Blues. We saw B.B.
King’s place and the

subsidize our sojourn.
-in fact, the

and impeccable serv-
icé disgusted us. So,
as an act of solidarity
with’ the oppressed
study class (that’s
you), we got a room
at the historic (no
capitals here) Day’s
Inn across the street.
Look, ma. . . free
towels! It was just as
good as Belk, and we
had our very own
bathroom to puke i

Rum Boogie Café; that
is, we saw them as we
walked by because
neither of them would
let us in because we
were underage. So,
we wound up going to
this sorry college bar
(they were happy to
serve us Cokes) that
reminded us of KA
except the music was
even worse (if youcan
believe that). In other
words,. Davidson’s

wearing, Jim Beam

Oh, yeah ..
forgot to mention the
superlative police department there
inthe Delta’s Jewel. As wearrived
Saturday morning (you were still
lost in hangover hell), a gentleman
was being removed from the his-
toric Day’s Inn for some slight
infraction of the criminal code.

We're sure he didn’t really mean |

to break into that liquor store. So
the Memphis blues were kind
enough to station eleven police
cruisersin the middle of the 4%*&
street, right outside the &($& hotel

_ parking garage so we had to park

on the %$*& street. Speaking of

‘ Memphis’ finest (we guess). . -

apparently they have undercover
bums to go outand harass the regu-
lar, wine-swilling uh, well .
“economically challenged” folks.
Now, before you gocall usa bunch
of “sensitivity challenged miscre-
ants,” we’d just like to mention
one shining example of this genre

currency. We should mention that
every business establishment in
Memphis has little cards that pro-
claim something to the effect that
the city provides enough shelter
and food to those who seek it.
Their advice, “Don’t give away
money.”

Normally, “don’t give away
money” is advice well taken, butin
the case of someone potentially
Starving or freezing (and it was
cold), it seems a little harsh. So,
we thought it particularly kind of
Memphis to provide this com-
prohensive crisis relief; only Dave
T. apparently didn’tneedanightat
the shelter. So, he tried the honest
approach. According to Dave, he

- wanted money to get drunk, and

two dollars wouldaboutdoit. Well,
who can deny an honest man a
drink? So, of course we gave him
the two bucks. Besides, we had to

swilling, Southern
Rock culture isn’t just
an isolated example of bad taste,
it’s a universal kind of thing!

Now, in case you’re thinking
that this city is the center of moral
decadence (we know we were;
that’s why we compared it to
Gomorrah earlier), let us assure
you the Christian element was out
in force. In fact, we saw what
appeared to be Hazel Motes on
Beale St. bearing his cross (liter-
ally). In fact, fora second there we
could have sworn that we were in
Huston’s version of Wise Blood.
The town was replete with old cars
(which, by the way, ifthey’re good
preclude one from justification),
and people running around in go-
rilla suits.

Fortunately, Dave T. arrived
just in time to convince us that we
were, in fact, in Memphis by ask-
ing us if we could spare some more
change. We wish we could say

and got up a head of steam.

By that I mean, Ted, beginning
well beyond the top of the ,hill
where the road was flat with his
sled on ice and his body bent over
it like acareening gorilla, ran. Ted
never just started something. He
flung himself into it. And when the
vector of his energy met the side-
‘walk and he flattened out, head
back, batting helmetsculpted down
the back of his neck like an air-foil
and his toes pointed stiff as old
‘Keds would allow, on thatsled, his
chest, even the backs of his bared
knees seemed like one big runner,
waxed and loosing itself to the
world.

At least they seem: that way
now. Then we just watched, though
we felt like we were doing some-
thing as real as motion. Our hearts,
mine at least, beat faster (mine
warmed up) .

that we gave Dave enough money
to move into a nice house, get a
good car, put his 2.3 kids through
college, and getajob atGraceland,
but what do you think we are, the
Federal Reserve? So, we just gave
him another buck and let Uncle
Sam take care of him on the deficit.
Allinall, however, Dave T. wasa
much more enjoyable conversa-
tion partner than the moralizing lot
on Beale St.

Having had a full night (we
also went to see Elvis and MLK’s
memorial), we went back to our
hotel, took in some live Jazz, and
went to bed; it had been a day of
adventure and wonder along the
Mighty Mississip’ and we were
exhausted.

Now you may have noticed
that we left out the details of our
getting drunk and hooking up.
Well, OK! We admit it; some
gumbo weate was the nearest thing
toa stiff drink we had and the only
woman we talked to was our wait-

“ress.

The next moming, we left.
However, we departed Memphis
with the satisfaction of having seen
the Civil Rights Museum at the
Lorraine Hotel, Graceland, Beale
St., the Historic Peabody, the Great
American Pyramid, lots of boring
roads, 44 movies each without a
real plot, the arrest of one individ-
ual, one really big antique store
with a lot of headboards (some of
which were apparently famous for
certain infidelities they witnessed),
the people: who make the Bible
Belt whatitis, and one honest man,
Dave T.

Allinall, ifitcame down to de-
stroying either Davidson or Mem-
phis, you guys better nothold your
breath. And, rest assured, we
wouldn’t be looking back! We’d
go straight to Graceland, Mem-
phis, Tennessee!
