The Forgotten Debt

Okay, so finally both parties,
after proclaiming they would try
hard to be bipartisan, have come
out with two different budget plans.
Both call for elimination or con-
solidation of government programs
tax decreases and virtually no debt
reduction whatsoever. It actually
is hard to tell the plans apart from
one another except that the Repub-
licans want more cuts and broader
tax breaks than President Clinton.

The problem here is that the
debt will not be reduced. Clinton’s
first budget proposal was excellent
in reducing the debt $600 billion.
He was the first president since
Harry Truman toactually have two
consecutive years of debt reduc-
tion. The plan came due to tax
increases mostly on the upper class

and froman effective gas tax, which
contrary to Republican beliefs, did
not drive fuel prices through the
roof. Since that budget package,
the economy has been in high gear,
growing so fast that the Fed. un-
characteristically raised interest
rates to battle a possible increase in
inflation. Despite politic’s eco-
nomic no-nos (tax increase, inter-
est rate rise) the economy gener-
ated five million new jobs and has
lead the American economy to be
the strongest in the world —
WHILE REDUCING DEBT.
Now, enter the NEWt right,
and their budget plan calling for
widespread tax breaks along with
massive government cuts. The cuts

are great, but do we need a tax

break right now? No. There is no
reason to increase the real income

Evolution:
the elaborate lie

I bet that got your attention.
You’re probably asking yourself
what this wacko is up to. Well, I
plan to prove, using scientific evi-
dence found by the evolutionists
themselves, and by several basic
principles of science and math, that
the theory of evolution is a scien-
tifically unacceptable theory which
is taught’simply because no better
one can be found. Evolution has
become a religion requiring pure
faith for its existence.

Let us begin by looking at

several fundamental flaws in the
theory. The second law of ther-’

modynamics states that all things
left to themselves tend to go from
a complex state toward entropy.
The theory of evolution requires
the complete opposite — the build
up of a more complex form from a
simpler one.

The Law of Biogenesis states
that all life comes from life. How-
ever, the theory of evolution re-
quires that life be spontaneously
generated. There is absolutely no
scientific evidence stating that this
is possible. In fact, all evidence
points to the opposite as shown by
the Law of Biogenesis.

Asa famous evolutionist said,
“By this theory [evolution] innu-
merable transitional forms must
have existed, why do we not find
them imbedded in countless num-
bers in the crust of the earth?”
Yeah, good quote, Eric, but who
said it? That quote is from Charles
Darwin’s The Origin of Species. It
points out the basic flaw of the
theory. There is no evidence.

I am not saying that things do
not adapt slightly to their environ-
ment over time. There is evidence
of that. But there is no evidence
connecting different kinds of ani-
mals to each other. If the theory is
true, there would be. According to
evolution, we evolved froma single
cell.

Itcan be argued that it was too
long ago to find evidence of devel-

opment in those stages, but scien-
tists have large fossil records of
dinosaurs with no link to mam-
mals from them. There are no
fossils of the development of the
bird.

According to Darwin’s theory
there should be millions of reptiles
who had little growths on there
back, then larger and larger growths
until they became more like wings.
Also during this period of time the
organism should have switched
from cold-blooded to warm-
blooded. This process should have
taken millions of years with bil-
lions of examples. There is not
one. There is not one link between
reptiles and mammals. There is
not one link between dogs and cats
or between humans and apes.

Now I’ve come to the sensi- .

tive issue. We were all taught in
school that there are missing links.
There are none. Neanderthal man
still exists and is simply a sightly
different form of human (like black
and white, or hispanic and orien-
tal). I cannot get into the specifics
of every example (such as Pilt-
down man which was taught for
forty years to be the missing link
until it was exposed as an elaborate
hoax) because it would take too
long. Suffice it to say there is no
undisputed evidence by evolution-
ists themselves proving the miss-
ing link.

However, there has been evi-
dence found of man from the Pleis-
tocene through the Jurassic and
Cambrian eras. which has been
thrown out by scientists as false.
This is because according to the
theory of evolution man couldn't
have existed billions of years ago
(that’s when the missing links
were), but they throw out all this
evidence of human existence and
keep looking for the “missing link”
which they cannot find.

Since Darwinian evolution is
so full of holes, 80% of evolution-
ists now believe a form of evolu-

of the American public right now.
Consumer activity is nowhere near
recession levels, and we are still
saving quite a bit of money. In
their interest to balance the budget,
the Republicans want to cut back
welfare and other entitlements,
which represent some 10% of the
federal budget while just the inter-
est on the four trillion dollar debt
accounts for 16% of the federal
budget. The solution is simple but
not politically attractive: continue
with the government cuts and do
not offer any tax breaks.
InClinton’s inaugural address,
given during the height of his popu-
larity, he said that we would have
to go through some “tough times”
to ensure “better times.” He was
talking abouthandling tax increases
to_be able to reduce the debt and

thus allowing tax breaks at a much
later time. Unfortunately, the presi-
dent has fallen victim to his cam-
paign promise of a middle class tax
cut, which he must follow through
on or risk losing in ‘96. This is a
sad lesson of how the election pro-
cess can actually end up hurting
what is good for the country, for
Clinton had to make that promise
in order to win the presidency.
The overall effect of a presi-
dent who has lost his ideals and
Republican Congress that salivates
over cutting taxes, and government
is the forgotten cause for debt re-
duction. Both budget plans oper-
ate on a deficit and have set aside
paltry amounts of spending to go
against actual debt reduction. Of
course social security (48% of the

federal budget), the benefit of the

generation running Congress cur-
reatly, will be kept fully in tact. I
don’t know what’s going to hap-
pen when “Generation X” takes
over running the government. We
will face a massive debt that will
probably constrict the social secu-
rity and medicare benefits we want
to receive. We will be stuck with
the hard part, while our parent’s
generation will get to live out the
“cradle to grave” protection the
American government wishes to
offer its citizens. If only the cur-
rent government would think about
the. well being of their sons and
daughters other than their political
success, then maybe, just maybe,
we- would not have to be stuck
paying of one massive, 20-year-
old IOU.

Major in what you want.

Maybe it’s just me but every
time I go home for break people
ask me the same question either
because they are extremely boring
and have no other small talk op-
tions or because they simply are
ignorant.

“Hi Holt, how’s school?”

“Fine.”

“Great. What are you major-
ing in?”

“Well, actually, I’m-majoring
in writing.”

I don’t knew why, but I al-
ways preface my answer with the
word “actually” because I know
my answer will provoke snickers.
The reaction is always the same.
They giggle a bit, and then they see
that I am not giggling, and they
clear their throat and become seri-
ous.

“Well, what are you going to
do with that? Write a book? Be-
come a teacher?”

Then I lose my patience be-
cause I feel like they peg me as an
“English person” for the rest of my
life. So I tell them my canned
liberal arts education speech.

“No, I could be essentially
whatever I want. It’s a liberal arts

school — meaning all the majors
more or less have the same weight.
I know several doctors that were
English majors. Medical schools
are looking for that kind of diver-
sity these days.” (I do know some
English majors that went to medi-
cal school, but the rest I kind of
made up).

People look at me when I tell
them this, but they hardly ever
listen. The fact is, at most other
schools, the major is so specific
that they start working towards it
from the first day of their freshman
year. They start worrying about
their social security just a year
after they started seeing rated “‘R”
movies. Heck, the first day of
school at Davidson, I had no idea
what I wanted to major in. I’ve
gone from political science to phi-
losophy to English to finally the
Center of Interdisciplinary Stud-
ies, Like most students, I wasn’t
sure what I wanted to do. Luckily,
through the core requirements, I
was able to test the waters of all the
different areas before I made my
final decision. :

* As an “experienced” senior,
people ask my advice on what to

major in. What I like to say is
major in whatever you want to
major in. Major in something that
you will never have the opportu-
nity to study again. That’s why
you are in college — to learn about
areas that you never could have
before. If you major in the subject
that you truly enjoy and want to
explore, not only will you do better
in that subject, you will have no
regrets. I believe that the under-
graduate degree should be looked
upon as “play time in the world of
academia.” Dare to dance through
some accounting. Play a little in
medical ethics. Do cartwheels in
anthropology. Adventure through
some literature. Just play. Take
advantage of the undergraduate
world while you can.

Many times I think we are so
consumed with our futures that we
forget. how valuable our present
undergraduate experience is. You
want to specialize? Fine. You
should, and we all need to in order
to pursue our goals. But if you can,
save the specialization for gradu-
ate school and enjoy the tremen-
dous opportunity you have as an
undergraduate.

tion called mutationism. This states
that there is no record of the miss-

‘ing links because there were major

mutations in organisms which
caused the advantagéous changes
found in evolution. This theory is

even more faulty and is statisti-

cally impossible.

To date there has been no evi-
dence of a helpful mutation. How-
ever, evolution requires that thou-
sands of these impossible muta-
tions occurred at the same time in
several organisms and without any
destructive mutations. That is the
only way they could have repro-
duced. Statistically this is impos-
sible. I have been convinced that
evolution is a scientifically un-
sound theory requiring more faith
in the unknown than any religion
could. Evolution has replaced
Christianity as the national reli-
gion.
