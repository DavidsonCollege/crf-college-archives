more, are so tied up in classroom work that
they can’t get off to vote?

Why was it that the number of those who
did not vote increased by fifty on Wednes-

those fifty were eliminated and they were
just too lazy—or didn’t care enough—to help
pick the man who would finally do the job?

Let’s look at those figures onee again, Out
of an electorate of 925 voters, there were only
576 votes cast. The election is by majority
vote, hence 259 votes can name the president
of the student body, an office which should
be filled by majority vote. Were we presi-
dent of this Davidson College student body,
we would most assuredly want to have the
confiderice of a majority vote behind us.

The student body. officers; the members of
the Student Council, have the duty of uphold-

wonder that there may be something to the

view that student government pretty
much of a farce after all. For instance, the
student body voted on whether or not to
install a permanent manager in the Student
Store; but two months before that vote was
taken, the administration was already look-
ing for a man to fil} the position. In many
such cases, the ‘‘student government’ is
little more than an advisory board to faculty

There are others who consider student gov-
ernment and student elections merely as good
propaganda material for next fall’s Rush
Week. While we sincerely hope that student
government means more than that to rhost
of us, there are those on the campus who
look at student offices in that light.

If all the students would take an interest
in student government and would vote, stu-
dent government could be just that. It eould
command authority, Also there would be no
question of any polities being involved be-
cause there is no group on the campus that
is numerically strong enough to have any
political power if 925 votes were cast in
every election.

This editorial is not to he construed in any
Way as a reflection on any man that has
been elected to office this year. Weare solid-
ly behind all of those men who have been
elected to date. It is rather a plea that every
man consider it his duty to vote so that elee-
tions will be more of what its name implies
that it is.

We might suggest for future consideration
that if there is not more widespread par-
tieipation in the coming elections, some sort
“quorum’’ method be introduced into the
electoral system so that 85 or 90 per cent of
the students would have to vote in an elee-
tion to make it valid. After all, student goy-
ernment is little more than a farce if
not endorsed by all the students.

Dear Editor:

Since the pages of the DAVIDSONIAN
have carried this year criticism of ,almost

every part of the chapel service from the
Scripture to the ‘‘swishes,’’ | would like to
question the frequent, and T believe unfor-
tunate use of one of our most popular hymns.

dent body, which

to come to the aid of a weak (?) strength-

us are acquainted with the Christian doctrine
of Christ’s Kingship in the church and of its

The Davidsonian
Suggests...

By BOB HOLLISTER

Each week, from the appearance of this issue until the end of
the school year there will be printed in this column a series of articles
concerning our campus organizations. The articles will appear each
week—one written by a member of the organization in question and
the other written by a student outside of that particular group. Each
contributing student will have been asked to state his personal
opinions in regard to the value of the organization to the student
body and to Davidson; in addition he will be asked to give his views
on the relation existing between the student body and which ever
group is being discussed. Finally he will, to the best of his ability,
point out any modifications which are, in his opinion, necessary in

making the organization a more active; more helpful;

and more in-

terest agent in the life of every Davidson man.

The first pair of articles to appear in this series, have undertaken
discussion of our YMCA as their topic. The Davidsonian asked Carl
Eborn and Jack Payne to make the first contributions to this column.

THE YMCA
By CARL EBORN
In any consideration of the
YMCA, as to its accomplishments
short comings, it abso-
lutely necessary to remember that
any which might be in-
volved is purely hyper-critical.
Little difficulty is experienced in
the effort to cite many varied and
noble activities of the Y. They
sume such channels as: Bible study
on Wednesday night, and deputa-
tions on Sunday
However this program not

thirst that never
There are those whoseem
to be the most consecrated and yet
reach that point on the journey
where all they meet seems to be
doubt; a horrible whirlpool which
seeks to draw them under and ex-
tinguish the very light which has
led them the challenges of
the past.

There are those who wit-
worship service, study the
ible and associate with consecrated
Christians for years, but are never
influenced or a
richer life.

It is in with these
two phases of the religious life at
Davidson,-it seems that the Y
failed most. And it quite ob-
vious that the complexity of the
problem necessitates no simple
answer. However, as Rome was
built so must the solutiom be worked
out,

One initial step would be to en-
courage those “frustrated” men to
take heart over the words of Jesus,
for if they truly seek, they shall
undoubtedly find. The brightness of
tomorrow's sun reflected in the
today’s clouds. The
seemingly pitfall is but the valley
before a higher ridge; the summit
of which affords a larger view than
ever before.

The progress of the “Y" in any
effort to bring Christianity home to
more of the students is greatly im-
peded by the connotation generally
applied to religion. Some have the
idea that it means standing on the
street corner and asking passers-by
if they are saved or not; others
have the opposite idea that it means
being a good: boy and going to
church on Sunday. The greatest
gift in existence should certainly be
appealing, though there are many
materialists who will aways refuse
to accept it. Since the religious life
of ‘the college centers around the
YMCA it scems reasonable to ex-
pect the Y to show every man what
Christian service means. Most peo-
ple are seeking something; that
something is a new life in Christ,
but they don't realize it because
of the ever-present disguise.

Facts must be faced! A failure
of the YMCA to present a program
that is complete enotgh to fill the
need, is a failure of every individual
student in the student body. It has
long been one of man’s dubious
talents to stand by, do nothing,
pass the burden off on someone
else, and then complain because the

THE Y.M.C.A.
By JACK PAYNE

I was asked by the Davidsonian
to write an article: in criticism of
the YMCA, I have chosen rather
to write on a subject which, though
it is in the nature of a criticism,
directed not so much toward the
YMCA as toward all of us as mem.
bers of that organization. This does
not mean that the Y beyond
criticism nor does it imply that 1
think it is doing a perfect job.

The display of new spring bonnets
regularly brings great crowds to
church on Easter morn. This un-
doubtedly was what led a religious
paper to go poetic as early as 1901;

“Attend your church,” the parson
says.
To church each fair one goes;
The old go there to cloge their eyes,
The young to eye their clothes, ~

“O Wod some power the giltie gie

The main _ point of emphasis
should not be “Look how much

tution,” or “How much better job
we're doing than such and such
school with twice our student body.”

Brothers Morgan, “Bull-run” Rid-

the holder of the modern two-year

on an expedition deep into the heart
of darkest Yankeeland. They were

their progress through Maryland
the “bunks” were stopped by of-
ficers of the law who accused them
the. following: attempting to
smuggle Brother Riddervold across
the border, transporting _ illicit
propaganda, violating Gopher's re-
cent legislation and carrying a Rebel
in the person of Brother Morgan
through the Northern lines. They
were frequently delayed when Rid-

truth, This leads us to abhor the
point of view of other people who
differ from ourselves and creates
a real enmity within the church
fold. :

Paul, in his letter to the Philip-
pians, offers us this choice word of
advice:

“Do nothing from selfishness or
conceit, but in humility count
others better than yourselves, Let
each of you look not only to ‘his
own interests, but also to the in-
terest of others. Have this mind
among yourselves, which you have
in Christ Jesus, who, though he was
in the form of God, did not count
equality with God as a thing to
be grasped, but emptied himself,
taking the form of a servant, being
born in the likeness of men.”

Unless we count ourselves to be
equal with God, we will be very,
very humble and very respectful
of the views, and faith of other peo.
ple, knowing that it’s a very real
possibility that we can be wrong,
that in any event their views and
ideals count for something in the
eyes of a God who places supreme
value on the dignity of every in-
dividual.

Neither will we rest on our oars,
but will ever endeavor to see more
closely that vision which, for most
of us, is still clouded as through a
glass. ‘

It will make a man consider twice
before he says, eyen jokingly, “I
pity that church; they're going to
get a union mah.”

Paul concludes: “And being found
in human form he humbled himself
and became’ obedient unto death,

Peverdeatir oi a Cross. Therefore ;

God has highly exalted him and
bestowed on him the name—which
is above every name, that. at the
name of Jesus every knee should
bow, in heaven and on earth and
under the earth, and> every tongue
conféss that Jesus Christ is Lord,
to the glory of God the Father.”

It was Christ Himself who said:
“Whoever would be great among
you, let him become the servant of
all”

To that-end we must-strive,
