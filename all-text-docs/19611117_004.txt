Union Will Peddie

A Book-A-Month

The Bookshelf Committee of
the College Union has initiated
a program designed to promote
interest in reading books of
current importance.

The current selection is The
Ugly American, by William J.
Lederer and Eugene Burdick,
which tells the story of “what
really goes on behind the sec-
ret, red-tape curtain of Ameri-
can diplomacy.” “It is especially
relevant in view of the rise of
President Kennedy's Peace
Corps,” committee chairman
Harold Fisher explained.

Copies of this and subsequent
books in the program will be
available at the Union desk for
sale.

Fisher stated that a different
book will be promoted every 3
to 4 weeks. The books to be
selected will be of no special
classification, and Fisher said
that his committee would wel-
come suggestions by students.

“The purpose of this program
is to spotlight books which the
committee feels all students
should be acquainted with, not
because they are required to be

but solely for personal satisfac:

tion,”’ Fisher said.

A native of Pittsburgh, Elaine
Richey began her violin studies
atthe age of four. Upon being
graduated from Oberlin Con-
eervatory with special recogni-
tion, she was immediately a-
warded a scholarship to the
Curtis Institute of Music where
she studied with Ivan Galamian

views. She is currently Assist-

Plans to have Josh White for
that date vaporized with the
news that White would not be

is more, the Davidson-Wake

Following the concert an in-

Sweetbriar Here
For Joint Concert

On Wednesday, Nov. 29, and
Friday, Dec. 1, the choruses
from Davidson and Sweetbriar
Colleges will combine to give a
unique program.

An oratario never before pre-
sented anywnere, entitled “For

that Wednesday at the girl’s
school in Lynchburg, Va.; and
the Dec. 1 performance will take
place here in Hodson Hall of the

Bricken. Bricken is the head of
the Musie Department at Sweet-
briar and will conduct the per-
formances. He has also been the
eonductor of the Seattle, Wash.,
Symphony Orchestra.

The programs will be a com-
bined effort on the part. of the
schools. In addition to providing
its chorus, Davidson will furnish
the woodwind and percussion
instruments. Sweetbriar will
lend its chorus, two pianists, an
organist, and faculty narrators
to the performances.

“What final effect the map

C. SHAW SMITH, whose feats of magic are not unknown on the campus, spent his vacation
last summer in the Midwest performing before various college summer-school students. Relaxed
in his office, Smith discusses his idea of leisure education. (Steff Photo by McCutchen.)

Smith Expresses Idea

Of Leisure Education

BY BOB IVEY
Davidsonion Feature Writer
“I saw C. Shaw seesaw . .

pshaw!"

As you might guess, this bit
of literature concerns the only
“C. Shaw” we have around here:
Smith—of the Union fame. And
that first twongue tister was
only to prepare your twongue,
er, tongue, for those to come.

Did you realize that this very
capable “Gentleman” ('39) is
even more faméd as a master
prestidigitator and a_ virtuoso
in the art of legerdemain? (He’s
a magician!)

OF course, all of this comes
as no shock to you upperctass-
men, but it may interest you to
know that the Davidson campus
is not the only one where his
talents have been displayed and
applauded. in fact, this is only
one of many—especialily after
the experiences of the Pshaws,
uh, Smiths, last summer.

This family is really one big
bundle of tricks, including five.
little ones aged two to twelve.
which recently experienced a

magical summer vacation filled’

with travel. music, camping. and
rabbits.

Since an important facet of
C. Shee, er. Smith’s purpose in
this travel and visitation was to
acquire information about. and
ideas from the student activities
work at other colleges, he was
able to extend his vacation per.
iod to seven weeks of vacation,

visitation, and work.
During this time, he amazed,

. emused and entertained summer

students at colleges and univer-
sities all over, including the
University of Texas, lowe State
University, the University of
Nebraska, Oklahoma State, Kan-
sas State, and four others, ap-
pearing as part of their “Enter-
tainment—" or “Artist Series.”
But he didn’t do it alone. Not
on your floating lady!

Every member of the family
works (or plays) in this produc-
tion. Each of the little Smiths
participated in the perform-
ances directly assisting Dad in
the delightful deception and
working with Mom, making
musical merriment. Whatever
the assignment, every member
of the group enjoyed (and was
enjoyed) sharing in this family
project which provided them a
wonderful trip and an enjoyable
experience.

This idea developed as a di-
rect result of Smith’s speaking
and entertaining at a meeting of
cotfege union directors last year
at Wichita, Kansas. He received
invitations from many colleges
from Washington and California
to Louisiana which he was not
able to include in the trip and
has already received several in-
vitations to return to the ones
which they visited.

“This.” Smith says, “is. not
just magic’ or entertainment.
It’ fits into the kind of thing

that I (and we) try to do to pro-
mote basic fellowship and the
discovery of leisure time educa-
tion.” ‘He expressed the idea
that “we must learn to use
leisure time while in college in
order to know how to use the
much more leisure which con-
fronts us after college. Leisure
time education is education in
the broad sense, but it is educa-
tion, nevertheless.”

This is the idea behind their
entertainment and his work in
the College Union here. When
asked of the possibility of our
obtaining ieisure education
through the medium of their
show, Smith replied jokingly,
“We'd love to do it, and several
have mentioned it to me, but no-
body has yet offered to sponsor
us!”

Smith, who has entertained in
many areas of the U. S. and in
twenty-seven foreign countries,
now fills engagements all over
this section of the country, find-
ing time for this by “doing
magic while other men play
golf.”

Concerning the possibility of
another summer magic. tour,
Smith mentioned that “several
campuses in New England have
expressed an interest in our act,
and we're exploring the possibi-
lities of a one month tour
there.”

A master magician, a family
of fun, and a terrific trip.
