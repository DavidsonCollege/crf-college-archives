highest elements of the East and West in
his own training,.and is one of the most in-
teresting men Davidson men will be able to
see and hear this year.

Just which of his subjects Mr. Joachim
will choose for the Davidson student body is
not known, but it will be selected from among
the following:

East and West in a New World Renais-
sance,

Gandhi and the Nationalist Movement.

Comparative Religions.

Hindu Literature, Poetry, and Folk-Lore.

The Women of India.

-India’s Economic Situation.

The Caste System of India.

Hindu Philosophical Systems.

It is highly possible that he will choose
the subject of Comparative Religions which
has pleased other college audiences immense-
ly this year. In it he discusses Christianity,
Mohammedanism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Con-
fucianism, and Zoroastrianism. However,
whether he chooses this subject of another,
it is certain that time spent in hearing him
will be of great value.

The lecture will start promptly at 7:30 in
Shearer Hall. Professor Shewmake an-
nounces that arrangements have been made to
postpone the regular prayer meeting until
the following night in order that no conflict
will occur. All students are urged to take
advantage of this lecture and a cordial invi-
tation is éxtended to townspeople and others
who may wish to attend.

Student Dramatic Club
Offers Varied Program

of Plays During Season

Professor Erwin Will Supervise All
-Productions of Club

PRACTICE SOON

Red and Black Masquers Will Pre-
sent Numerous One-Act Plays
During Year.

The Red and Black Masquers, Da-
vidson’s representatives in the field
of dramatics, have organized for the
coming year, and all indications

point to a very busy season. Last
year, for various reasons plans of
the Dramatic Club failed to mate-
rialize, and the students had to be
content with outside entertainers.
Under the leadership of Val Guthery,
president, and Tyree Dillard, busi-
ness manager, the.club will strive to
fill the need of student dramatics.
Most of last year’s members will
again be available, and their ranks
will no doubt be.augmented by sev-
eral new additions, since some very
promising material is in evidence
among the different classes. Pro-
fessor Erwin will supervise the pro-
ductions as usual, and his assistance
will, no doubt, prove invaluable.

It is the plan of 'the managers to
present a very diversified program.
At least one regular three-act play
will be produced, and also a number
of one-act plays, short skits, and
novelties.

SCHENECTADY,

Adele Arbuckle is
Honored at School

Miss Adele Arbuckle, daughter of Dr.
and Mrs. H. B. Arbuckle, of Davidson,
and a freshman at Agnes Scott was elect-
ed to the chairmanship of her class. In
this capacity Miss Arbuckle will lead her
class in a competition against the sopho-
mores to get up the best stunt, the re-
ward for which will be the traditional
black cat. It has been the custom at
Agnes Scott for the past several years for
the two lower classes to write, act, and
promote a stunt, given before the entire
student body. The reward is a plaster-
paris form of a black cat, which remains
in the possession of the winning class.
Both competition and interest are keen
in this unique custom, and it is no little
honor to be elected chairman to lead the
class in an effort to win the affirmative
vote of the judges. The contest will take
place next Saturday, and both classes are
working furiously to present the better
stunt and capture the unusual prize.

The election of Miss Arbuckle wins for
her an additional honor, a more personal
one, in the fact that she has so quickly
won the hearts and friendship of her
classmates. Although this does not mean
the presidency of her class, yet it puts her
well in line for that later honor-when the
class 6rganizes. Miss Arbuckle is a grad-
uate of Davidson High School of. the
class of ’27. During her High School
career she manifested her qualities of

for a list of suitable plays, and as
soon as one can be chosen that meets
all requirements, work will begin in
earnest.

Church Choir Enlarged

Under Prof. E. J. Cullum |

Platform Will be Enlarged to Ac-
commodate Six Students

The Presbyterian Church choir has
been reorganized under the directon of
Prof. E. J. Cullum. With the installation '
of Dr. Moffat on Sunday, September
25th, the church became ably supervised
in a Sfiritual way and the music will now
be well directed. A training class will
he begun by the director in the near. fu-
ture, :

Prof. Cullum plans to enlarge the choir
to a certain extent. The platform will
be broadened to make room for another
row of male singers. The front row of
sopranos and contraltos will be moved
forward on the new platform, making
room for six male singers directly in front
of the organ. The two chairs on either
side of the organ will be left for two
tenor and two basses, on the left and
right, respectively.

The choir’s training class will hold its
meetings in Shearer Hall every Wednes-
day nght at eight o'clock. It will be in
the form of a rehearsal for the Sunday
anthems and special music.

The director has not yet decided how
to select the members, to use the new
choir seats. A group of college boys will
contest for these places. The whole idea
is to add a group of male voices and
thus get more volume in the voices.

ors at Agnes Scott are a continuation of
her work here, and a budding of rich
future promise,

in free competition with leading athletes of
the Hawaiian Islands, China, Japan, Italy,
Germany, France, England and Austfalia.

Grantland Rice calls him.,“the fastest man
of all time,” and Harold Dibble, member of
the Olympic Games Commission, said of
him; ‘Paddock can answer the reason for
athletics better than any other American.”

He discusses a theme that is close to his
heart—clean sportsmanship—in the battle of
life, as well as on the athletic field. He is a
fluent speaker with an incisive and thought-
if€piring style and with a keen appreciation
of humor.

He was recently featured in Bebe Daniels’
production, “The Campus Flirt,” by the
Famous Players-Lasky Producers,

His lecture at Davidson is sponsored by
the Y. M. C. A.,.and not by the College Lec-
ture Committee, therefore it will be neces-
sary to charge a small admission.

in theory. Concentration plus perseverance
is an unbeatable combination.

Lastly, naturalness in. all relations of life
is a vital factor in beginning a successful
well rounded man. :

Be natural in your relationships with God
and with your fellow man and you have noth-
ing to worry about. To be religious is the
most natural thing in the world for student
or savage and the greatest drawing power in
any man’s life is the.power of Jesus Christ.

Even as the backswing is important in a
golfer’s stroke so a man’s backswing of years
spent in college will be important in his later
life. Get your eye on God’s ball; accept
Jesus; live for Him, and then you will be
able to hit the ball far down the fairway of
life.
