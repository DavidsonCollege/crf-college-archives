Clyde Randolph

The death 0: Clyde Randolph was a souree
of griei and sorrow to many’ icllow thembers
of the: Dayidson Studeat Nody. Those who .
knew him realize that Davidson has been
deprived of the presence .of a noble char-
acter.

___‘\ senior witha very good scholastie ree:
ord. Clyde had achieyed everything he had
done by his own etiorts. He was going lo
school earning his own’ way as he went
He was coming up the hard way, and the
results of his sineere etioris and dewrmina
tion to make good in life showed up in his
character. Those who are earning their
own way can look at the briei career of.
Clyde Kandolph as an example of what can.

heavy burden.

Glyde would have made a maine for him-
self and done a great work in his chosen
profession, the Ministry. ii he had been al-
lowed to live. When a person of his moral
and religious stature dies, we can always-
rest assured of tus state of blessedness and
should pernaps be happy for him even
though we are deprived of his presence
Those who plan to pnesue the work for
which Clyde was preparaing himself should
see in him an inspiration to do part of the
work he would have done im addition to
their own.

Clyde Randolph stood for the things Da-
vidson stands for. May we have more like
him.

ON NICKNAMES. (PRE SENT-
ING A ROUGH DRAFT OF THE
RULES: FOLLOWED IN. -THIS!
PROCEDURE BY CAMPUS
SAGES). |

It is. generally conceded that
man will live a great dea! longer mm
the memories of ‘bis fellaws

a nickname _

Recause of the multitude of as-
peets from which this cinstitution
may be considered, we must narrow
this dissertation to a short study of]
the causes and motives common to
this art.

It seems, probable that men here
on the campus are nicknamed for
four. reasons gencrallyx (a) for some
famous act (b) for some infamous
act (c) for some personal charac-
teristic Or (d) for the antithesis of
some personal characteristic.

It may be said of these four dis
visions that they narrow the scope
of the art in that they do not pre-
tend to cover the entire field. This
restriction may be justified in Part
by thé local nature of the discus-
sion. |

Let us consider first the, relative
power of. (a),-some’ famous act. One
who is the author of such an act
will oftentimes find himself_a.walk-
ing and: semi-perpetual monument
to that act! For instance, a man
may instigate a mammoth Beaver
Club “Salem Day” and be known
thereafter as “The Big: sBeaver."

| Again it is the fashion to name men| or

ter—national—figures—whom they
may resemble either physically or
by some characteristic of conduct,
as “Floyd Gibbons” Grantham and
“Shirley Temple” Rogers.

“Some men have become known

(and listed) for financial coups and | be

as 4 Tule-WiN become “J. P.,” “Mon-
eybags,” or a member of the Pan-
Hellenic Council. a

Perhaps the above paragraph

famous acts and be listed along with
certain class room blunders and
prize--honers which have delivered
hicknames upon their perpetrators.
among these. has -beeén
Nea" ‘Lemmon: :

A predominant pefsonal charaé Y

and teristic is often the origin of such
‘contemporaties it he is possessed of

a caption. A gross individual will
bean apt subject -for “Fats” or
“Bevo.” while a man who registers,
facial blank will draw “Dead:
Pan" or “Great Stone. Face’ Now-

a

‘a prodigious cater is as a rule ad-

dressed as “Glut” or “Freight cat”.
and a man noted-for-his proximity

to the sidewalk is called usually by

“Duck,” “Shorty,” . or . “Stumpy.”
“Noxious Normie the Prehistoric
Man” is self-explanatory.

Nicknames are often selected for
their poetic or musical qualites with
a leaning toward words that begin
with the same letter as “Jumping
Joe.” “Fluffy Duffy," Gorgeous
George,” ete.

-It may seem a bit strange that the
average collegian is nicknamed not
for some personal characteristic but_
for the lack or antithesis of same.
For instance a man known for the
scarcity of the information he im-
parts may be known as “Gabby.”
In like manner a man who is spar-
ingly built is often known as “Tar-
zan” or “Slugger,” whereas one who
is possessed of a rather meek and

pacifistic demeanor will unani-
mously become “Cyctone,” “Killer,”
“Dynamite.” ?

~ Fhis motif seems indeed to be the —
Prevailing trend. Other examples
are found in the tags “Swifty” or
“Speedy” being affixed to lazy
easy-going individuals. Again a
person known as a mental void will
“Brainy” while a stoic will be
“Cheerful.”

Thus it is that the local “wags
work to perpetuate their, fellows
and keep going an age- -old institu-
tion.

pr ee

year that everybody should attend,
it’s Mid-Winters, ‘cause there'll be
about the prettiest crop of gals, a
bunch of old Grads will be back

lf there’s any dance set in the;and the “Pan-Hell” hopes to make

enough cash on this venture to
carry two more big-name bands for

the other two sets this year. So,
let's all that possibly can, BE
THERE!!!
