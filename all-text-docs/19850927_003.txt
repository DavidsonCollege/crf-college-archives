—— Beyond Davidson

— a weekly news summary
By JANE AURELL

Headiining the news for the week of Sep-
tember 19-25:
Internationally—

A violent earthquake rocked parts of
Mexico City causing massive death and
destruction; an unofficial 15,000 persons
are feared dead. Naney Reagan visited
the devastated area, bringing with her a
check for $1 million as a “down pay-
ment” on aid from the U.S. The world
has responded generously to Mexico’s
plight.

After one week of attacks, South Af-
rica withdrew her troops from Angola,
but the Pretona announced that it will
support the rebels fighting Angol’s Mar-
xist government. President Botha set
stringent conditions for talking with the
African National Congress (ANC), the
main concern is the ANC’s ties with

The Outside World In Brief

Moscow. Anti-apartheid spokesman
Rev. Allan Boesak, charged with subver-
sion and terrorism, was released from
prison on $8,000 bail.

In a major about-face, the French
government admitted involvement in the
July sinking of the Greenpeace ship in
New Zealand. The Rainbow Warrior was
preparing to lead a protest of French nu-
clear testing in the South Pacific. New
Zealand is accusing France of state-back-
ed terrorism.

Elsewhere in the world: In Moscow,
the KGB arrested a Soviet citizen on
charges of spying for the U.S.; this is the
third such arrest in two years. Last Satur-
day marked the sixth year of fighting be-
tween Iran and Iraq. China’s Communist
Party, in a continuation of its rejuvena-
tion measures, appointed 62 new mem-

bers to its. central committee and prom-
oted six younger policy makers to the
Politburo; these new appointments re-
place last week’s retirees.

Also, the U.S. is negotiating a possi-
ble arms sale to China. The governments
of North and South Korea arranged for
“war-torn” families to be reunited after
40 years of separation. Margaret
Thatcher visited the Middle East as part
of the ongoing effort to create the
framework for a regional peace confer-
ence which would also involve the U.S.
and U.S.S.R.; to date this laudable goal
has not been accomplished. Monday
marked the beginning of the United Na-
tion’s 40th General Assembly.
Domestically—

The trade policy war between Con-
gress and the President continues.

Reagan announced a series of retaliatory
measures against unfair trading practices
from abroad and pledged to enforce abi-
dance to existing trade agreements. The
Defense Department announced plans to
test all military personnel going overseas
for evidence of AIDS virus; testing of
new military recruits has already begun.
The results of Reagan’s post-operative
exam indicate a full recovery. Finally,

of the century, Hurricane Gloria is
threatening the entire U.S. east coast.
Thought for the week:

“The heartbeat of the human race is
knowledge-in-process, a constant and
dedicated activity of learning more about
ourselves and our proper place in the uni-
verse.”

Rusk Program Broadens International Perspective

By DAVID WILLIAMS

Former Secretary of State
Dean Rusk ’31 has stated, “As
today’s young people face the
coming decades, it is apparent that
the human race is moving into a
new and critical chapter of its long
history. Homo sapiens now faces
a series of problems which are dif-
ferent in kind or scale from those
we have faced before and which
will require tolerable answers
within the next three or four de-
cades if the Family of Man is to
avoid catastrophe... I am
deeply convinced that this gener-
ation of young people now in our
schools and colleges is destined to
write a unique chapter in the his-
tory of the human race. Our older
generations must do all we can to
prepare them for the critical chal-
lenges ahead. There remains
much to be done, requiring as
much- imagination, creativity,
sanity, tolerance and courage as
can be found. Davidson College

has a vital role to play in this ef-

fort.” |
Acting in accordance with this
idea, the Davidson College Trus-
tees voted unanimously on May 6,
1983 to establish the Dean Rusk
Endowment for International

Studies, “honoring Davidson's
most distinguished alumnus.” In
September 1985, the dreams of
the Trustees are becoming reality.
The Dean Rusk Program for Inter-
national Studies has commenced
in the Carolina Inn on Main
Street.

The primary aim of the Dean
Rusk Program is “to give each stu-
dent, first, an informed awareness
of our whole planet, and second,.
direct knowledge of at least one
foreign area,” as stated in the
Prospectus of the program. Col-
lege president John Kuykendall
has added that, “No student
should graduate without exposure
to an international education. The
Dean Rusk Program should not be
a separate school but a dimension
in the total Davidson experience.
It should capture the imagination
of every student.”

On the personal recommenda-
tion of Rusk, former ambassador
to Bulgaria Jack Perry became di-
rector of the program. Perry has
already taken several steps to get
the program moving, and at pre-
sent, the program comprises five
areas: “Bringing good speakers on
international affairs to the
school;” the 4:30 Thursday

forum, which is “an informal get-
together for discussion of world
affairs;” counseling students on
international careers, as well as
graduate school; “a series ot
speakers on world affairs as they
affect other careers,” such as
medicine, law, and ministry; and
the establishment of a graduate
school catalog library.

The forum has been successful
in its first two weeks. In the open-
ing forum last week, the Davidson
International students were intro-
duced to the College Community.
Yesterday, returning JY A’ers dis-
cussed their experiences in Mar-
burg, Montpelier, and other JYA
programs.

“Aside from these projects,”
Perry stated, “we are feeling our
way.” One area of concentration
is the faculty. “They are the heart
of the program. We are trying to
get the faculty involved, to secure
grants, and raise money for the
faculty, so that they can attend
conferences and do research
abroad. We also will be striving
for curriculum enrichment in the
College.”

A Student Advisory Commit-
tee for the Program was estab-
lished two years ago. Member

¢

N

Paulette Kuranj stated that the
committee is “here to provide a
student perspective on interna-
tional education at Davidson and
to give Dr. Perry a link to the stu-
dent body.” Other members of
this committee, which “meets reg-
ularly to discuss issues of interna-
tional awareness on campus,” in-
clude Mary Mulhern, Lisa Ander-
son, Julie Sternal, Laura Rainey,

Charles Tambiah, and Mark
Sandy.
Perry emphasized that the pro-

gram is just getting started. He
added that “the program is not a
major” such as the Center for Spe-
cial Studies, but is instead ‘‘an
across-the-board program to en-
hance the international dimension
of a a Davidson education.”
Trustee Blaine Kelley, Jr. and
Development Officer Jerry
Stockdale dreamed up the Pro-
gram while working on a fundrais-
ing campaign in early 1983. “The
Program itself was an outgrowth
of regional campaign ideas,” said
Stockdale. “It was felt that the col-
lege ought to honor Dean Rusk,
and that it should honor him ina
big way. Since the college already
had so much interest in interna-
tional studies, why not bring it all

together into a unified program?"

Kelley and Stockdale, along
with Kuykendall, have played a
major part in raising the funds
necessary for the developrnent
and endowment of the Program.
At present, $2.6 million of a goal
of $10 million has been raised.
“Many proposals and grants have
been submitted by corporations
and foundations,” said Stockdale.
Last week the Ford Foundation
granted $100,000 to the Program
to bring visiting speakers and
scholars to the campus. “The plan
being developed now is to try to
complete the campaign through
large gifts, rather than through
widespread campaign. The idea of
building up an endowment is to
create support for the program in
perpetuity.”

On October 24, Rusk will ap-
pear at Davidson for the official
inauguration of the Program. He
will participate in a panel discus-
sion on current international af-
fairs with students as part of the
Convocation program. “Wouldn't
it be great.” said Perry. “if we
could raise the rest (of our finan-
cial goal) by 1989, Mr. Rusk’s
80th birthday year?”
