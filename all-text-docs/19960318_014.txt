I’m still
proud

By Davip MortLock

Bring on UMass. But why
stop there? Bring on UConn.
Bring on Georgetown. Bring
on anybody. Why not? We
won 19 games inarow, thrash-
ing Opponents on their home
courts by 40 or 50 points. We
had a defense almost as fa-
mous as UNLV’s amoeba de-
fense of the early ’90s, and a
solid team-oriented offense
that complimented the ability
ofeach player. Wehada Chris-
tian Laettner in Harwood, a
Bobby Hurley in Alpert,and a
Grant Hill in Ozone. It was a
team that looked and played
very much like the Duke team
that upset the Running Rebels
on their way to the national
title. ts

But I wasn’t asking for
ourteam to knock offaUNLV.
All I wanted was for them to
beat Western Carolina. Ididn’t
need a 40 or-50 point blowout,
a 2 point nail biter would have
been just as good. I wanted our
players to climb the ladder,
scissors in hand to cut down
the nets, knowing that the the
NCAA tournament was theirs

_|to play.

I also wanted to see
“Davidson” written on mil-
lions of tournament brackets
across the country. I wanted to
go to next year’s game against
N.C. State and bring a sign that
read “WE WENT TO THE
DANCE, WHERE WERE
YOU?” and not “I GOT A
700 TOO ... IN MATH.” I
wanted to get respect not just
for my school’s academic
greatness but for our athletic

‘| superiority as well.

It just wasn’t meant to be.
Even though Dick Vitale
pleaded to the selection com-
mittee over the television air-
waves to let Davidson into the
tournament, our fate had been
sealed from the minute the
buzzer sounded at the end of
that fateful game.

Still I watched last Satur-
day with 30 other guys in the
basement of Sig Ep as ESPN
flashed the NCAA teams onto
the screen.

When fate had left us out,
I felt myself start tosulk. Then,
I realized I had fallen in love
not just with our basketball
team, but with the idea that
they were going to make
Davidson, and me indirectly,
recognizable to the world.

But as our memories of
the basketball season slowly
fade away, I havea much more
importantdesire: that the play-
ers who made up the 1995-96
basketball team know that we
are truly proud of the effort
they put forth, and know that
the magic of the season lay not
with their impressive wins but
with the hope and excitement
they gave to us all.

Western Carolina halts dream season

By MICHAEL KRUSE

The Southern Conference
tourney was moved to the posh
Greensboro Coliseum from
Asheville, but the venue became
the site of Davidson’s worst night-
mare March 3, playing their worst
game of the season at the worst
possible time, and falling to South
Division champ Western Carolina,
69-60.

The Catamounts (17-13, 10-
4) earned the league’s automatic
NCAA tournament bid, their first
ever trip to the Big Dance, and sent
Davidson (25-5, 14-0) to an NIT
date with South Carolina.

Davidson’s last lead (13-12)
came 9:40 in, as Western built a
39-27 halftime advantage.

The deficit grew to 47-30 be-
fore the Wildcats embarked on a
furious 19-2 run spanning the next
nine minutes, leaving the score
knotted at 49-49 with 7:38 to go.

But Davidson missed their
next seven shots and Western
sealed the shocker with a back-
breaking 8-0 run. :

Southern Conference Player
of the Year, tournament MVP, and
sixth-leading scorer in the country
(26 ppg) Anquell McCollum fal-
tered individually, scoring just 13
and missing all six of his three-
point attempts, but his teammates
picked up the slack.

Sixth man Kevin Kullum
notched 12 points and 10 boards,
Jarvis Graham added 11 points,
Joe Stafford, the nation’s top three-
point bomber, 10.

For Davidson, Narcisse
Ewodo starred, collecting 15 points
and 13 rebounds, while Williams
contributed 17 and eight. Chris
Alpert tallied 16.

But, Davidson stumbled to
33% shooting (23-for-70) from the
floor (16% below their season av-
erage), 12.5% (3-for-24) from be-
hind the arc (24% below), and 61%
(11-for-18) at the line (12% be-
low) .

Josh Glazer
Ray Minlend dishes to “Ozone” Williams as the physical WCU zone converges on him in the final.

The Wildcats, who
outrebounded opponents by 5 per

game throughout the year, got beat

on the boards 51-39.

Versatility and bench play was
nonexistent, as Jeff Anderson
scored the sole reserve basket.

Quinn Harwood, one of
Davidson’s most reliable forces in
the paint, scored only six, grabbed
two boards, and fouled out with
three minutes left in the game.

Ray Minlend, usually an of-
fensive dynamo, scored four on 1-
for-6 shooting.

“Davidson had a lot of pres-
sure on them when they came here.
And I think it showed,” Hopkins
said,

“Sometimes you have it,
sometimes you don’t,” said South
Carolina coach Eddie Fogler after
his team dismantled Davidson on
Wednesday in front of 7,168 at
Carolina Coliseum.

On Wednesday, the Game-

cocks most definitely had it, put-

ting on an utterly dominant offen-
sive show, shooting 69.4% from
the field, 70% from behind the arc,
and 71% from the line.

Sharp-shooting guard Larry
Davis had it, converting on 12 of
his 13 shot attempts, including all
seven of his threes, on his way to
33 points.

Point guard BJ McKie hit 14
of 15 freethrows, tallying 22 points,
while forward Malik Russell buck-
eted 16 on 8-for-10 shooting.

“When they put it together,
they’rea pretty talented team,” said
McKillop, “Certainly they put it
together tonight.”

After Davidson jumped out to
an 8-0 lead in the first three min-
utes, South Carolina responded
witha 17-Srun. Davidson claimed
a 25-23 advantage on a Minlend
layup. But the Gamecocks closed
the half with a 22-8 spurt to take a
12-point lead and momentum into
the break.

The spread grew to 17 (65-48)

at the ten-minute juncture and a
game-high 32 on a Davis dunk
with 3:20 left.

_ Minlend was the highman for
Davidson, slashing for 17 points.
Jeff Anderson, starting in place of
an injured Ewodo, tallied 14 on «
five of seven field goal attempts.

Senior backup center Mark
McGuire finished his collegiate
career by tying his season high of
eight points in 21 minutes, and
Mark Donnelly shot 3-for-4 from
long distance, accounting for 11
points off the bench.

The seniors, who make up the
winningest class:in Davidson his-
tory, ended their careers with a 75-
40 record.

But even with their many tri-
umphs, the fortieth loss will un-
doubtedly linger in their minds.

“It'll be a tough Spring and
Summer knowing that your last
two games were probably your
worst,” said McKillop, “Those are
supposed to be your best.”

Mountaineers end breakthrough year

New talent and old stalwarts push Wildcats to record-breaking season

By MicHAEL KRUSE
Assistant Sports Editor

The Wildcat women quietly
had the best season in program
history, going 14-12 (7-7 in the
Southern), and fulfilling their sea-
son-long battle cry of NBG-Noth-.
ing But Greensboro, the site of
women’s league semifinals and
championship.

But top-seeded App. St. (23-
6, 14-0) ended the inspired cam-
paign on March 2 with a solid 83-
68 victory over Davidson and then
knocked off Marshall the next day
to capture the conference’s auto-
matic NCAA Tournament bid.

Davidson arrived in Greens-
boro with high hopes after its 80-
51 quarterfinal blowout versus
Tennessee-Chatanooga on Feb. 28

in Belk Arena, but the Mountain-
eers’ inside-outside strategy sim-
ply proved too strong.

As coach John Filar said, “To
beat Appalachian St, you have to
hope they have a semi-off night
from the perimeter. You pay when
they start hitting the threes.”

And Davidson paid. Hinton
and forward Merideth Thompson
represented the inside punch, each
scoring 14, while guard Melissa
Davis hit five of seven three-point-
ers en route to 23 points and 8
rebounds.

Davidson trailed 50-40 after a
high-scoring first half, in which
the Wildcats shot 53%. But, App.
St. started the second frame with
an 11-2 spurt. From then on, the
deficit inched consistently up-
wards, growing to a game-high 19
(80-61) with 8:29 left.

The Mountaineers coasted the
rest of the way. “In the second half
today, we really stepped up our
defensive intensity and only gave
up 28 points to a good ballclub,”
said App. St. coach Linda
Robinson, “We beat a great bas-
ketball team today.”

Carolyn Kirsch, 2nd team All-
Conference, led the Wildcats with
14 points and 7 boards, while Jes-
sica Montrella added 12 and 6.

Jamie Brown posted a double-
double (12 points and 10 rebounds),
while twin sister Kerry added 8.

Elizabeth DuBose scored 9
points, her season high, and dished
out 4 assists.

Senior Kristen Ferrucci, who
scored 7 in abbreviated action due
to a knee injury suffered in the
quarterfinals, and classmates Molly
Burke, Tonya Sharpe, and Maggie

Young all played their last

- Davidson game.

After having posted just five
and four wins in the last two sea-
sons, respectively, this year’s 14
wins represent a dramatic turn-
around.

“T’m awful proud of the young
ladies we have and we’ ve done this
year,” said Filar, “I hope you would
all tip your hats to them.”

Robinson praised the resur-
gent Wildcats during the post-game
press conference: “Davidson is so
talented with the recruits and the
upperclassmen. They’ve really
done a fanatastic job with mesh-
ing. They’ve become an extremely
dangerous basketball club because
they have everything.They’ ve
brought in some nice kids who are

nice players.They’re right on
track.”
