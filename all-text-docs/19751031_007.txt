Last year, Barber became inter-
ested in Greanias’ new play. Along
with his interest in bicentennial
drama, Wilson, to Barber, possesses
a special association with Davidson,
having attended here his freshman
year (1873-74).

Over the summer, Barber under-
took considerable research about Wil-
son, in order to better understand the
man. This , to Barber, is no easy task.
In the view of many Americans,
Wilson was an unsmiling, unsym-
pathetic, and distinctly impersonal
figure.

To Barber, one of the primary
purposes of the play will be to portray
the Wilson little seen--a very human
President, capable of strong emotion,
ambition, and desires.

With the focus upon Wilson the
man, drama and historical recon-
struction are united. Wilson:upon his
inauguration of his second admini-
stration in March, 1916 was faced
with in Barber’s opinion, ‘“‘the
greatest problems of any President we
have had.” Also embued with strong
moral principles, Wilson, perhaps
tragically, attempted to put these
principles into practice.

Wilson is the ‘‘closest thing to a
Greek tragic figure’ of 20th century
American politics. What, according
to Barber, is his ‘‘tragic flaw?’’ On
this subject the director was cons-
picuously silent, leaving something
for the curious--with or without the
play--to find out.
