Stunt night lived up to the highest ex-

program from beginning to end was full
of mirth and melody and was enjoyed
by all of the six hundred and twenty-
five persons who packed Shearer Hall to

its fullest capacity. As a substitute for

Senior Speaking, it more than filled the |

bill and it is belived that it will become
an annual event at Davidson.

The program of the evening was pre-

wishing to come out for the debating

according to the side which they repre-
