According to reliable sources,
spiders have taken over a room
on third floor of Dana Science
building. The Spiders are
multiplying rapidly.

Already six female mature
spiders have produced 22 egg

coons. Reports indicate the
species have been identified as
‘‘Nephila clavipes...."’

No, this is not another science
fiction thriller, but a research
project being conducted by
Biology professors Donald L.
Kimmel Jr., David C. Grant
and Cynthia T. Grant.

These three professors and at
present six students are
studying many aspects of the
spider, especially the process
by which the spider builds its
web. Three approaches,
histological, biochemical and
behavioral, are bing utilized in
this research project.

“A unique aspect of our
research is the bringing
together of these different
backgrounds. In this way we
hope to study the in-
terrelationships of these ap-

proaches,” said David Grant.
‘Up until last summer, the
research project was only an
idea. During the summer two
trips were made to Mc-
Clellanville, S.C. in order to
collect the species, ‘Nephila
clavipes.’

Since that time, the research
project has received a $650
grant in the late fall from the
Research Corporation of Atlan-
ta, Ga. The professors are now
applying for a long term grant
which will enable them to in-
volve many more students in
their research.

During fall term of this year,
students in Kimmel’'s
Histology class and seven
students in Grant's In-
vertebrate class were involved
with various phases of the
research project.

Jim Campbell, one of six stu-
dents still involved in research,
is studying the neurological
composition of the spider. By
employing special stains that
will only color certain tissues,
Campbell hopes to identify and
study the nervous tissue of the
spider.

‘‘Last term, we had a

problem finding a stain that
would not cover the entire body
but just one particular type of
tissue,’’ said Campbell.

“There is interest in spiders
because not much research has
been done on them. It may be
possible to come up with
hypotheses that have not been
formulated, or possibly iden-
tify some tissue. It adds a cer-
tain adventure to the project,”’
said Campbell.

Another student, Marshall
Case, is attempting a
population study of spiders un-
der a controlled environment.
He began with one cocoon and is
keeping close statistics on sur-
vival and mortality rates.

Since beginning the project,
the researchers have learned a
lot of data and facts concerning
the spiders. They hope to apply
some of this knowledge on a
wider scale.

‘‘Although we are not looking
at every fact in terms of applied
knowledge, neural control of
behavior and secretory activity
has a very large application,”
said David Grant.

tors involved in web building.

“One interest in this study is
how web building is controlled
by the neurological center, and
how this neurological control
acts on the release on chemicals
involved in silk synthesis,’’ she
said.

Considering the behavioral
area, David Grant has been
studying the coordination that
the spider must achieve in cat-

ching flies and in repairing and
hnilding the web.
Kimmel has concen-

trated on the histological
aspects of the research.
Neurological staining and em-
bryonic development have been
some of the areas of his focus.

David Grant points out that a
question commonly asked is
whether the spiders are
poisonous.

“The spiders do have a toxin
they inject in flies they kill, but
we have not tried to find out the
effect this toxin has on a man,”’
he said.

ROTC To Continue
Despite Draft End

By ALAN FORD
Staff Writer

Secretary of Defense Melvin
Laird has announced the end of
the draft. Will one of the results
be the demise of the Davidson
ROTC program?

Colonel Virgil P. Foster,
professor of Military Science
(PMS), doesn't think so. “‘The
people in this type of program
now are not in it because of fear
of the draft,’’ he said. For this
reason Foster said he is not ex-
pecting too many drop-outs. “‘It
has about leveled out now,"’ he
added.

Foster cited the changes that
have been made in the David-
son ROTC program as the main
reason. ‘‘We are in line with the
college; we have our classes
arranged to fit the 10 week term
used here,’ he said. He further
stated that students in ROTC
only have to drill one term a
year at Davidson as opposed to
all year at many other cam-
puses.

Foster also said that the
program here at Davidson
College is student oriented.
There are enough fringe
benefits to keep it viable
without the draft.

When asked whether he
thought ‘the end of the draft
would result in ending ROTC,
Davidson Draft Counselor Steve
Dodd said, **I think the Army is
counting on the fact that
enrollment will not drastically

reduce.'’ He _ cited both
monetary and other _in-
ducements offered by the
program as the basis for such a
feeling on the part of the Army.
‘I hope the students who wish
to disenroll from ROTC wait un-
tilspring term todosoout of con-
sideration for the department
simply because the members of
the department have helped
particular students afd given
them ‘a way out’ of impending
induction. However, in light of
recent developments, any
student who wishes to get out of
ROTC should do so,” Dodd said.
Dodd pointed out that when
the draft expires on June 30th,
all that will actually end is the
President's power to induct; the
Selective Service machinery
will remain active. Dodd
stressed the fact that
everybody will still have to
register on his 18th birthday, or
within a 60 day period beginning
30 days before his birthday.
According to Dodd, immediate

istration will be critical.
