few minutes of the second half that the regulars played. His
floor game was as of old

- stealing the ball, grabbing re- |
hounds, and breaking up enemy passes.

Bill Iverson played.a rough and tumble game, but at the

clear to shoot more and with this fifth man firing at the bucket
along with the rest, the Cats should be a much improved ball
club. The shooting of the whole team was off, but a little more
time on the practice court should iron that out.

With the announcement that Davidson will play seven
basketball games in Charlotte this season, we suppose that the
ones who count the money around here are setting back and
rubbing their hands with ecstacy, But not so with the student
who will haveto take a seat in the end Zone oF up in the bal-
cony where half the court is obscured from view. And all this
after going through the trouble of rushing their supper, or
maybe even missing it, standing on the bumming corner with
fifty or sixty other students and then maybe not even getting
au ride in time for the game. To see the preliminary at 6:30 or
7 o'clock, one must miss his supper. at Davidson and only then
he may be one of the lucky few students ‘who arrives at the
Armory in time to get a front row balcony seat and gain a
reasonably decent view of the game.

We realize that the present gym does not take care of more
than the student body itself, and that to finance the Atheltic
Department from baskeball at all, the games must be played
in the Armory. But the old qnestion arises as to Who jis. en-
titled to first choice on seeing the Cats play. We feel that it
is the Student Body which supports the team.Therefore, the
Student Body should not be shoved off in an obscure corner
of the Armory for the game. As we have pointed out, it is
hardship enough 19 give up a whole evening, with classes next
day, and travel twenty miles for a game, ‘without having to
worry whether there'll even far-off
corner of the Armory. b

As a remedy we suggest that Davidson students be given
tlhe seats set up on the stage of the Armory. This will not be
enough for the whole attending Student Body, but it would
lea marked improvement. over the present: seating situation,
The bleachers erected on the rear side of the Armory could
remain reserved, with baleony and stage for Davidson and
tlle end zones sold as general admission. It ‘will cut the purse
from reserved seats, but we feel that the Student Body is
entitled to a little better seating arrangement than hereto-
fore. If there is reason why this is impossible or impracticable
we would be glad to hear it and change our views accordingly.

Davidson’s men of tennis have been given recognition in the
recent release of the ratings of Southern racquet wielders.
Bo Roddey, the Cats number one player, has been listed num-
her five in the men’s singles bracket. Roddy established him-
self as a national competitor last summer in making better
than average showings in the tours of the top court circuits

Freshman Dewey Keesler drew a number four rating in the
Junior Division. Keesler is slated for the number one spot on
this year’s frosh team. Another freshman, Allen Strand, was
placed in the number 18 spot in that division. Two sopho-
mores, Bill Childs and Pete Kennedy were listed seventeen and
