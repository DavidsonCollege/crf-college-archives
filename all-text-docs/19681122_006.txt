New policies on holidays,
vacation and leave for non:
academic personnel, repre-
increases in each
case, were announced this
week by the college adminis-
tration.

“This represents the first
real standardization of our
policies in this area.”’ said
Robert J. Stephenson. assist-
ant business manager. ‘‘Pre-
viously matters such as sick
leave were often decided sub-
jectively. so that our prac-
tices were not always consist-
ent."

The number of holidays
has been increased to 10 and
the vacation period to two
calendar weeks for all full-
time custodial. maintenance
and laundry employes with 12
months of service prior to
July 1, 1969.

“I want Davidson to be
known as the best place. in

‘the area to work.” said Presi-

dent Samuel R. Spencer Jr.
He said he felt the college
should set the pace in such
matters as compensation and
working conditions, as one
way of fulfilling its responsi-
bility to the local community.

APO To Sponsor
Drive For Needy

Alpha Phi Omega service:
fraternity has started a drive
to collect food, clothing and
toys for needy families.

Each social fraternity has
been asked to contribute $15
to the drive. and APO will
seek contributions from In-
dependent upperclassmen and
freshmen.

Wray Stephens. a junior
who is coordinating the effort.
said he hopes to have money
and goods collected before
Thanksgiving.

A local social worker has
provided the names of needy
families.

money earned from grocery
receipts.

Phil Hazel. president of the
MSA. said the organization
can get one percent return
from al! college bills at
Cashion's Food Store in Cor-

nelius. provided they have
receipts.

Hazel addressed last
week's IFC meeting. He

asked the fraternities to
save any receipts from Cash.
‘ion’s.

The MSA is planning either
a playground for the com-
munity children or a beau-
tification program outside
the college. |

Hazel said that the 21 cou-
ples of the MSA could raise
$250 this year by themselves.
He said. ‘With the fraterni-
ties’ help. we could probably
get an additional $300 per
year, which would go a long
way towards getting a play
ground.”

A “married students fol.
lies’ will be held this spring
to raise additional funds.

The married — students’
group was first formed last
spring and received its char-
ter earlier this fall from the
student Senate.

The chief concérn of MSA
is to assist the administra-
tion in finding more and im-
proved housing accommoda-
tions for the college's mar-
ried students.

Social
Planning

Shifted

The Social Council will now
be responsible for all social
activities on al! concert week-
ends, according to Social
Council President Charlie
Cameron. These added re-
sponsibilites for the Social
Council came as a result of
the dissolution of the Union
Social Committee.

The now-defunct Union
Social Committee was pre-
viously in charge of all con
cert: week-end actiyities ex-
cept the concerts themselves.
which were the only respon.
sibility of the Social Council.

The Social Council will now
plan and administer ali week-
end activities, including 8
p.m. concerts, dances, bon-
fires, late-night concerts and
breakfasts.

Exams
Policies

Studied

Self-scheduled exams were
approved in principle by the
Educational Policy Commit-
tee Wednesday.

The committee deferred the
formation of a. specific plan
to a smaller committee, con-
sisting of Dr. Jay Ostwalt.
Davidson registrar: John
Williams: John Passmore.
member of the student Sen-
ate; and Pat Bray, Honor
Court member. Ostwalt and
Williams are regular mem-
bers of the Educational Policy
Committee.

The committee did decide
there would be a four-day
examination period in the
fall and winter and a three-
day period in the spring. Ac-
cording to the plan presented
by Williams last week, stu-
dents would be able to sched
ule their exams in whatever
order they choose within
these periods.

Before. the plan can be im-
plemented. the report of the
smaller committee must be
approved by the Educational
Policy Committee again and
by the faculty as a whole. It
would not go into effect until
the second term.

The self-scheduled exam
proposal was first presented
to the committee last week.
but it was tabled for a week
after some discussion.

Several schools have -al-
ready established self-sched-
uled exams. including Mary
Baldwin.

Computer Foul-Up
Delays Chapel Cuts

Why haven’t chapel cuts
been posted?—Mark Thomp-
son

Chapel cuts have now been
posted on the first and second
floors of Chambers. The de-
lay in posting them was
caused by a foul-up in the
computer.

The program used to record
cuts was being rejected by
the computer, and no “read-
out’ was available. A list
was compiled by hand and
has been posted. |

Why aren’t rooms in Cham-
bers open for study at night?
—Richard Hinson

The administration realized
that many students wanted
Chambers open for study at
night, and since Monday a
number of seminar rooms on
first floor have been opened
for student use.

The hours are from 7-12 on
Monday, Wednesday. Thurs-
day and Friday nights. On
Tuesday, rooms are used for
Free University classes.
