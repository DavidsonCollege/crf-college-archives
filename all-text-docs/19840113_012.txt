The arrival of 1984 brings all manner of interesting
possibilities for our own Davidson College. The David-
sonian, in conjunction with the editors of a noted publi-
cation located in Lantana, Florida (it rhymes with In-
spirer), has gained access to the inside line on what’s
ahead for 84 here at Davidson. With enthusiasm and the
assurance that the future is as easy to see as the gunk in
the corners of Chambers bathrooms, we present these
absolutely true predictions.

With so many young lovebirds swapping rings and
ringing those wedding bells these days, the College will
replace the Humanities program with an interdiscipli-
nary look at home engineering. “Who needs Plato when

there’re dishes to be. done?” one coed will exclaim.
* * *

Princeton has Brooke, and Yale has Jodie, but
Davidson will score an admissions coup this spring
when funk star Prince accepts the prestigious Stuart
Scholarship. His reason for leaving behind lucrative re-
cord contracts and scantily clad young women? “All I
wanna do is dance, play music, sex, romance. Try my
best to never get bored,” he will croon. Prince will ex-
press interest in becoming a hall counselor, but first he’ I!
join the Women’s Concerns Committee and the Peace
Coalition. **

The new athletic facility will be finished surpris-
ingly early next October, just in time for the 1984 Mid-
night Madness. The Hattie Johnston Gym (what used to
be called the Peregrine House Restaurant) will be lo-

cated between the laundry and the security hut. “The
Presidential Search cost a lot,” Trustee Fred Stair will
explain in reference to the facility’s diminished size.

* * *

The long-lost son of Chalmers Davidson will appear
in the Davidsoniana room next August, claiming to be
the College’s one and only true archivist. The son, call-
ing himself Peter Stuart Ney, will challenge his alleged
father to a trivia tournament about Davidson history.
Chalmers will naturally say nay to the pretender, and
Ney will say “Chalmers” back.

* * *

A huge swarm of pileated woodpeckers will roost
in the Chambers dome, messing up the bells and forcing
the College to spend millions on bird food and disinfec-
tant. “What was killed was eaten,” Captain Hughes will
exclaim.

A whirling dervish will descend from above and an-
nihilate the Philanthropic Hall, while leaving the rest of
the campus intact. “Gosh, it’s a shame,” Davidson’s
21st Rhodes Scholar, SGA President, Al Coordinator,
Sig Ep member, PUG member, Jazz Ensemble member,
hall counselor emeritus, and Phi Society member Hunter
Monroe will say.

* * *

When the entire class of ’88 vanishes in the
Freshman Regatta, a search will ensue. The Biology de-
partment will blame “Normy,” a monster they claim
closely resembles the dreaded Loch Ness monster.
