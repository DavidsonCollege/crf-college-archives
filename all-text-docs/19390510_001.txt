Rod Williams
ToB e Pastor

At the regular annual session of
the Davidson Unity Church Rod
Williams was elected pastor for the
coming year and Sid Crane was
elected assistant pastor.

This election is held on the first
Sunday in May every year, and the
congregation of the Davidson Unity
Church elects the pastor, assistant
pastor, and the board of directors
for the coming year. It is usually
understood that the pastor is chos-
en from the graduating class at the
college, and that he will remain
for one year. Watson Street has
been pastor for two years due to
the fact that he was pastor during
his senior year at the college and
also pastor during the past year.

Rod Williams, the newly-elected
pastor, was elected a member of
Phi Beta Kappa, was president of
the Philanthropic Literary society,
president of the Friendship Coun-
cil, and was a Monitor.

Sid Crane, newly-elected assist-
ant pastor, was recently tapped by
Omicron Delta Kappa, is the new
president of the Y. M. C. A., and
is a member of the college Glee
Club. :

Both Rod Williams and Watson
Street will attend the Well Youth
Conference in Amsterdam, Holland
during the summer months, Sid
Crane will act as supply pastor dur-
ing Rod Williams’ absence.

On last Wednesday night, Wat-
son Street presented the annual re-
port of the Unity Church to the
session of the Davidson * Presby-
terian Church and the Y. M. C. A.
Board ‘of Control. It was reported
that there were 40 new members

Proficiency
Drill Takes
Place Here

Major Arther E. Burnap of
State College Is Inspect-
ing Officer

On Friday, May 12, the R. O.
T.. C. Battalion of Davidson
College will hold its annual
proficiency drill, beginning at
2:00, on Richardson Field. The

inspecting officer will be
Major Arther FE. Burnap, who
is now stationed at North

Carolina State College.

Major Burnap will conduct tests
in the R. O. T. C. department's
classrooms on Thursday. Freshmen
will be examined on their knowl-
edge of rifle marksmanship, map
reading and making, discipline,
courtesy, and military sanitation.
There will be questions on higher
military subjects for the sopho-
mores and advanced R. O. T. C.
students. While not conducting ex-
aminations, Major Burnap will in-
spect the R. O. T. C. building,
grounds, and equipment.

The inspection of the battalion
will be divided into several parts.
First, there will be a callisthenic
drill; then the battalion will pass
in review and will be inspected.
After this each company must,exe-
cute different phases of closed and
extended order drill. In conclusion,
the company which is judged best
will execute a tactical problem on
the golf course.

This year, as in past years, a
large number of students, friends,
and alumni of the R. O. T. C. De-
partment will witness the climax
to a year of constant drilling. Col-
onel Armstrong, Major Ballad, and
Major Steel feel certain that this
year’s organization will receive an
“excellent” rating from the
specting officer.

Frazier, president of Queens-Chi-

are: 1. Character, 2. Reputation, 3.
Action, and 4. Personality. He elab-

Dr. Hillhouse
Writes Paper

Appearing in April, “The Munic-
ipal Year Book, 1939,” carried an
article by Dr. A. M. Hillhouse.

Dr. Hillhouse, writing on “In-
tergovernmental Tax Exemption,”
declared that states should have
the power to tax the income from
Federal bonds, and that the Fed-
eral government should also be
able to tax income from state and
local bonds. The author feels that
the end-result should be reached
on this question by a constitutional
amendment rather than congres-

sional action.

The author feels that Federal
and local autonomy are best pre-
served by the former cause, since
a Supreme Court decision in March
removed intergovernmental tax im-
munity from salaries of public em-
ployees. A bill taxing these was
passed by Congress in April.
