Our Fifth Anniversary Number.

Sunday's sentiment—Wanted : A fire-

man.

Here’s to our debaters—the best in
several States. Watch Cousar and Bel-
lingrath tack another star in Davidson's
crown.

The Orchestra “made a hit” at the

Normal.

Something else happened at Greens-

boro. Someone at Synod proposed to
make Davidson a co-ed college. Was it

satire, or did the gentleman think Da-
vidson would agree. Fifteen for Pres-
ident Martin, who opposed it.

Red and Black for the Phi’s,

On to Atlanta!) The Southern col:
leges will think our team worse than
Sherman's army. ‘They will make a clean
SWOOP.

We have been living thru some dark
days in the history of civilization. But
watch the Allies win!

RETROSPECT.

The time for our exit as a Staff in a
unit has come. As we look back over
thirty issues we see that mistakes have
been made and we see where, with more
funds vour publication could have been
more attractive. But it is with pride
that we look thru the file and see that we
have had the privilege of heralding the
big year in our historv. Many of the
things held as our policy have seen frui-
tion, But these things have been accom-
plished only thru the co-ordination of in-
terests entering into Tre Davipsonian.

INDERTEDN ESS.

To the faculty for their liberality in
allowing free press, and for their untir-
ing aid in helping to finance the paper,
we are thankful. Without the unani-
mous support of the student body we
would have been crippled. We are in-
debted to you for the many encourage-

aents you have given and for your loyal
o-operation whenever called upon. You
‘ave manifested a fine spirit comparable
o none, of which we shall never forget.

“or the subscriptions and letters of in-
erest for publication from the Alumni
ind friends we acknowledge deep grati-
ude. To the men outside the Staff who
‘ave composed a large part of the press
matter, we are indebted. Equally are
ve obliged to those aiding in the circula-
‘ion department. Finally in an unspeak-
able way we owe deep gratitude to our
advertisers who so nobly backed us—
hence supported you—and for this we
trust you will patronize them.

THE DAVIDSONIAN.

Tur DavipsONIAN is recognized as
one of the potent factors in uniting col-
lege, alumni and prospective students.
It is a channel of dynamic for the home
of Red and Black. It holds a unique po-
sition among the forces on the campus.
Tt is a mirror of campus life, reflecting

-]a spirit comparable to none in the South.

Its function is to serve the college first,
last and all the time, and not to cast a
slur on anything that would deter (as
some gentlemen have wrongly inferred)
the best interest of the college.

. Davidson men everywhere are more
or less zealously blowing Davidson’s
Many of them do not get the
sheet which gets them in closer touch
with "first-hand college conditions. A

standard should be to have three-fourths,

of the alumnj as paid subscribers on the
circulation lists. This field has not been
worked as it should. When you put a
Davipsontan in the hands of an alum-
nus you are giving him a powerful ele-
ment for the maintenance of activity.

INTRODUCTION.

Before we bid vou farewell it is our
privilege to introduce to you one who
has served with the publication since his
entry into college. We congratulate him
for the large audience to which he is to
speak and for the large number of read-
ers for whom he is to direct the policy of
We congratulate you
upon having such a ane to head his corps
of able assistants who will interest you
with Davidson's future laurels. We take
pleasure in presefiting to you Mr. F. A.
