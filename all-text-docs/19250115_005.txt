Davidsonian’s First Cross-eWord Puzzle

All Ready for Addicts of This Craze |

True to its promise, The Davidsonian
blares forth this week with its initial cross-
country, cross-word puzzle. The cut was
kindly loaned by The Charlotte News. It
was no one man’s job, and the concocter of
the puzzle felt as though he had been tramp-
ing a hundred miles in the Sahara desert with
snowshoes on, when he finally put the last
little criss-crosser in the proper place.

To the first hard worker who brings to
the editor the correct solution, will go the
prize of a subscription to The Davidsonian

for the rest of the collegiate year, the same

_ CROSS-WORD

to be sent to any address given, that of the
late Kaiser’s excepted. Although it is ex-
pected that every addict of the cross-word
craze will join in this merry game, the first

one who presents the absolutely correct de- |

nouement will get the grand prize. Those
who bring their solutions later will receive
honorable mention in the columns of this
publication.

Go to it, fellows. The library makes no
charge for the use of its dictionaries, and
the power house will keep the lights on all

one?

Gibbs and Sims were the only ones who
went to Shearer chapel. and they report

a very small attendance. Mr. Baker, of

Pritchett went to Cornelius, and
Christian to Hobson’s chapel. ;

Roland Parker organized a_ class of
older boys at the Mill chapel school,
where a good work is being done by the
students. . Franklin also attended this

| The minister must be in sympathy with the |
| business man, must know his problems, both |

| material and spiritual, and he must know his
| attitude toward the church. Business men
| criticise the church severely, but the speaker
| remarked that during the several years that

{never heard a business man say that he did
|not believe in Jesus Christ. They blame the
churelr for not doing things; they say that it
is the most inefficient industry in the world;
they blame the congregation for not co-
operating with the minister; and they censor
}it for using old methods, for not using mod-
fern business methods in administration and

not hear these criticisms, and naturally does
not know why he is not succeeding, Busi-
|ness men can talk over the faults of the
church among themselves, but they feel a
little hesitant in telling a minister what they
think of his church and his methods.

Another thing that bothers the business
man is*the inconsistency between the church
and the teachings of Christ. He cannot un-
derstand the clashes between churches, and
denominational bitterness and hatred. The
diversity of church customs also stands in his
way.

But in it all, despite his troubles and per-
plexities, there is something tremendously
important, which strongly appeals to him,
He is interested in Christ. Business men
have great respect for men who know Christ.
Therefore, in order to appeal to the business
man, to know his problems and to get him on
the side of the church, the minister must
know Christ and apply. His teachings.

After Mr. Williams’ talk, Mrs. Williams
gave a very impressive reading from Henry
Van Dyke, “The Toiling of Felix,” which
was very appropriate, bearing out the
thought that Mr. Williams had expressed.
The reading was much appreciated by all
present.

DAVIDSON
FIVE YEARS AGO

Davidson defeated Carolina in’ the first
basketball game of the season, by a score of
31-20. Roberts, of Davidson, was the indi-
vidual star of the game, scoring 17 of Da-
vidson’s 31 points. Others who showed up
well in this game were Captain Dwight Chal-
mers and Schenk.

Dwight Chalmers, who was captain of the
basketball team, was also president of the
Y. M. C. A. and one of the most popular
men on the campus. A full length picture of
him with a write-up was carried in’ The
Davidsonian.

The basketball team left on the first of its
three trips of the season. This trip carried
them through North Carolina, the other two
taking them into Virginia and South Caro-
lina respectively. On these trips teams such
as V. M. I. Washington and Lee, N. C.
State, Carolina, Furman, and Wofford, rep-
resentative of the South, were met.

“Tt is a personal problem of accepting and
believing in Jesus Christ.” Joining the church
at 12 years of age, he was not a Christian
until he was 27.) He had been a member of
the chureh, but he had not accepted God
with simple and childlike faith.

“In the judgment when asked

‘why they did not join the church, some will
say there were hypocrits in the church,” said
Mr. “God will, say ‘Sure,’ He

There is an old legend which tells that at
the heavenly gate, the gate keeper did not
know Charles of Hapsburg, King of Austria.
Nor did he know Charles of Hapsburg, King
of Hungary, but when Charles the sinner ap-
plied, he was accepted.

“The business world wants a man who is
willing to stand true to his colors,” said the

speaker. The little girl’s prayer, “Now I lay

childhood days, and he said that the heritage
of your home will be the bulwark that will
make the man of you.

As a closing illustration, he told of a
small boy walking along with his father. His
father offered to help him, but he said “No.”
He came to a slick place and fell. He then
asked his father to let him hold on to his
hand. But he was not strong, and he fell
again. Then he asked his father to hold his
hand. When he slipped again his father
