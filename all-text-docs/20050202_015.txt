This past weekend the men’s track team
traveled to Chapel Hill to participate in the
UNC Invitational. The meet was not only an
important measuring stick for the upcoming
season, but it also provided the young run-
ners with a chance to prove themselves
against a strong field that included UNC,
Wake Forest, and Duke.

Joe Taylor ’06 said, “It was exciting to
compete at such a large and important event
this early.in the season.”

The meet also presented a special treat for
the runners, as Olympic gold medalists
Shawn Crawford and Justin Gatlin were in
attendance.

On Friday, the first day of competition,
Davidson runners fin-
ished well in the 400,
5000, and distance
medley relay. In the
400, Stefan Flessa ’08
and Cisco Morales ’07
finished with times of
0:53.47 and 0:53.74,
respectively.

». In the 5000, Austin
a tan 07 Mercadante 06 man-

aged a third-place finish with a time of
15:40.15 despite a short training season due
to nagging injuries. Meanwhile, the DMR
team of Nick Lehman ’05, Flessa, Douglas
Noreen ’07 and John Doehring ’07 finished
fifth in the meet in 10:37.26. That was also
fourth-best in Davidson history.

On Saturday, Ryan Kleier ’07 and Taylor
ran the 60-meter dash in 7.73 and 7.96,
respectively. In the 200, Flessa ran a person-
al-best 23.63, while John Bialas ’07 came in
at 24.10 and Kleier finished in 24.96.

In the 800, Dave Ritchie ’07 and Morales,
who both typically run the 400 for the
Wildcats, _ finished
with times of 2:05.50
and 2:06.63, respec-
tively.

In the 3000, all
three Davidson run-
ners set personal-
bests. Alex Varner ’07
came in first for
Davidson at 9:03.55,
with Lee Wheless ’05
close behind in 9:05.92.

Overall, the team was satisfied with the
performance in just the second meet of the
indoor season.

Coach Gary Andrew said, “[I] was pleased
overall with the effort. The training has been
going very well.” In the end, he expects the
team “to be very competitive at the indoor
championships.”

Flessa, whose 200 time ranks among the
the fastest in Davidson history, said,
“Everyone did really well, and we’re already
a lot better than we were at the beginning of
the year.”
