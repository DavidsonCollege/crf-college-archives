Dr, Leland Park came
to Davidson in 1959.
Initiation’ began at
~ once. “We had to
wear beanies, namet-
ags until. Thanksgiv-
‘ing,” Dr. Park said.
~ “We had to stay off
-_the grass, learn the
songs. If an upper-
classman —_ stopped
you, you had to sing it

sit together at ball

games, learn the

Cheers. . .”. Freshmen
couldn’ lows their seats in in jee until all the upper-
classmen had gotten out.’ . We had a list of [rules of

consiel that we all had. to purchase from the bdok-
store,. . .and it had to be on the bulletin boards i in the
room.
At the same time, “the nametags. . _ would help.
you try to get'some names and faces together.”
_ "The necessity of importing girls “was terribly. in-
convenient,” Dr. ‘Park said. 'Fheré were three big'‘wee-
kends.each year, which. “were, just absolute humdin-

”

- gers,” according to Dr, Park, . “If you were a freshman, a
epende on upperclassmen friends. i.

pear youd
. who would have a connectipn”
At the time, all the freshmen were living i in Sen-

telle and Cannon. During the big-weekends “Belk dor--
-mitory was completely emptied of students and all the -
upperclassmen would move in with us. The. college ise
maintained a large number of. mattresses and they ~"
would be put in the rooms for you, It-was not at all un-

usual that there. would’ be thtce mattresses’ on the
-#loor.” The gitls stayed in Belk, “Ladies in town would
‘volunteer to sit in the omy and the shoe would arrange.

an elaborate microphone system and there would be a
speaker in the hall on each floor” so that the girls could
be paged when their dates arrived. “It was quite a for-
tress.” Since no drinking was allowed on campus,
many parties were held in Charlotte.

Despite the many changes, there are “constants
here that make Davidson the reason you want to stay:
the fact that this is a first-rate educational institution,
the fact that they respect people as. individuals and re-
spect integrity, honor, and truth, and the fact that ever-
yone speaks to each other. . . These are the sort of

values I think are really special.”

Mike Daisley ’78

Director of Cor-
porate Programs Mi-
chael Daisley entered
Davidson in the fall of
1974. After one term
he discovered the dif-
ficulty of time sche-
duling. “Winter term
was rough,” Mr.
Daisley said, ‘“‘be-
cause I was playing
JV basketball and had
an eight o’clock com-

‘puter course. I did'a
puter course. I did a lot of sleeping in that course.”

The fervor over

the new coeds was at its peak during Mr. Daisley’s

freshman year. The class of 1978 was the second class
with women. “The administration seemed to emphas-
ize women’s ability to compete in the classroom,” Mr.
Daisley said, “and did they ever. Generally speaking. .
. they were not socially oriented, which was somewhat
unfair to. both the men and the women. . . . | remember
the men often yeHed obscene things to the coeds and
those women yelled obscene: uniiigs back.”

Fraternity life differs very. little from when he
graduated, but other elements.of Davidson life have

changed. “I worked for WDA V. when I wag'a student,”

Mr. Daisley said. “Then it was known as the FM sta-
tion with less power than your average light bulb [ten
watts}. We played.a potpourti of music.”

_ He emphasized that changes in the coed Situation
have been the most dramatic. “It now appears that the
admissions office is looking for well-rounded women,
like they always have for men.” .
