THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

FRIDAY, APRIL 26, 1963

(Letters to the editor do not necessarily reflect the views of the editor.)

(All Unsigned Editorials by the Editor)

Through A Glass Darkly

Printed on this page are four
statements representing two different
points of view concerning the con-
tents of a letter to the editor which
was printed in last week's DAVID-
SONIAN. That letter contained the
comments of two students on several
issues, among them the Vagabond-
Administration relationship, and the
students’ opinion of the Administra-
tion’s “attitude.”

One of the statements belongs to
the President of Davidson College.
and another is by a past director of
the Vagabonds. After spending most
of this week talking to everyone con-
cerned, our hopes of being able to
print a factual report dissolving the
misunderstanding and personal feel-
ings involved in this matter have
faded dismally.

Much (but hardly all) of the ‘‘con-
troversy” centering on the Vagabond
charges can be traced to misunder-
standings and a great lack of defini-
tion of terms, and the present situa-
tion is not to be resolved before
everyone agrees on exactly what is
being discussed.

For example: the Vagabonds
(loose term, defined specifically here
as a loyal nucleus of members of the
drama group, based on Trotter, Chum-
bley. and others) state that Dr. W. F.
Goodykoontz, past director of that
group, was not reimbursed for his
work as drama director. The Admin-
istration (loose term, defined speci-
fically here as the President, both
Deans, the Business Manager, and
others) replies that he was indeed re-
imbursed—that he taught and _ is
teaching only nine semester hours,
and was offered a reduced load of six
semester hours at the beginning of
the year, all with pay for teaching
tweive hours. To which the Vaga-
bonds counter that one of the courses,
Creative Writing, was split into two
sections, requiring eight hours of
teaching a week, totalling closer to
fourteen rather than the full load of

twelve hours, and that even then the

ay for twelve hours was hardly re-
imbursement for the amount of time
he put into directing drama. To which
the Administration replies that this
was Goodykoontz’s own expressed de-
sire and choice. Try resolving the
acts” or whatever you will out of
that.

The other points of conflict are
also amazingly many-sided and com-
plex. For another instance, take the
very quote that apparently touched
everything off. Two weeks ago one of
our reporters asked President Martin
about the Vagabond budget. Martin
picked up a telephone and called the
bursar’s office, which reported from
the college’s books that the Vaga-
bonds had exceeded their 1962-63
budget. Martin told the reporter what
the books showed, and added that it
did not matter, as additional funds
would be provided when the Vaga-
bonds needed them.

The Vagabonds, however, feel that
the statement involved an implication
of mismanagement, as the official
1962-63 Vagabond budget was made
out last year with Professor Sneden,
and was not supposed to be binding
on the actual Vagabond program this
year under Goodykoontz.

Suffice to say that for a state-
ment of either position which has not
been tampered with editorially, read
the letters on this page. We are grate-
ful to both President Martin. and Dr.
Goodykoontz for preparing these
statements.

As for the idea of a YMCA-spon-
sored forum, President Martin has
said that he does not feel that such
a debate would accomplish anything,
and perhaps it would not. But at least
such a forum would bring the whole

affair out-into the open—if the Vaga-

bonds’ charges are built on thin air,
then an oven discussion should reveal
that. If not, then their story should be
heard.

A Defense Of Policy

Another question which arose in
the aftermath of last issue’s letter
concerned this editor’s policy on
printing letters to the editor. Dean
Johnston more than touches on this
policy, which obviously needs ex-
plaining.

President Martin knows that this
editor has never said, written, or
thought that he is a liar or that he
would willingly misrepresent any-
thing. Dean Johnston was rightfully
concerned when he felt that the
President of Davidson College had
been called a liar in print by two
students, and he is to be admired for
speaking out in protest.

The Trotter-Chumbley letter was
unfortunate for several reasons, one
being that much of it was not literall
defensible. Although the two stud-
ents did have something substantial
they wanted to say, they did not pre-
sent their case well, .

None of this is denied, but the
question of this newspaper’s right to
print a letter to the editor is another
matter. “Letters to the editor do not
necessarily reflect the views of the
editor’ is printed in the top left-hand
corner of this page, and that means
exactly what it says.

At the time, the “absolutely
false” clause used by the letter-writ-
ers appeared to refer to figures in-
volved in a budget, and although “ab-
solutely false” is strong language, any-
one can make mistakes with figures.
As it turned out, the students were
using erroneous information, but we
still hold that they were expressing
what they believed to be true.

It did not then and does not now

appear to this editor that it is his duty
to run a cross-check on all figures
quoted in a letter, of opinion to the
editor. Which leads to this statement
of policy on letters: let them say it if
they think they can back it up, and if
they can’t then let them take the con-
sequences. To the subscribers: letters
to the editor express the beliefs and
opinions of the person or persons
whose names appear at the bottom of
the letter.

That dees not say we will print
any letter received—no newspaper
does that. But as the only regularly-
printed outlet of opinion at Davidson,
this newspaper has a definite obliga-
tion to print what different people
think and want to say.

Finally, a word to those few who
have accused this newspaper of aban-
doning in the last issue a statement of
purpose (pledging a “new look” for
THE DAVIDSONIAN) scarcely a
week old (i.e. printing the Trotter-
Chumbley letter): our staff was and
is extremely proud of that April 19
issue.. The creative writing and pic-
ture-features represented a DA
SONIAN first, and much of that crea-
tive writing was among the finest
published here in years. None of the
features attacked anyone (in fact one
was about Richard Chase’s hopes for
a folk theater at Davidson, and an-
other consisted of a good word for the
Male Chorus), the news stories were
as objective as the news editor could
make them, and the sports page had
a brand new look, experimenting
both with the column and with the
headlines. Sorry, we have not aban-
doned a thing.

Letters To The Editor

President D. G. Martin

their budget but there would be additional funds available for the Vagabond program.

The official accounting rec-
ords of the college indicate
that on April 16, 1963, a total
of $5,548 had been expended
for dramatics. Income of $1,692,
primarily from gate receipts,
plus the budget allocated by the
college ($3,464) totaled $5,176,
leaving a deficit of $372. None
of these figures include salaries
for the Director, Assistant Di-
rector, and others who have
been paid from other budgets
of the college.

The letter stated that none of
the income from ticket sales
was credited to the Vagabonds
account. The records show that
all of this income has been
credited to this account as it
has been received.

It was also stated that they
were constantly told that the
budget had been overrun
“through what is implied to be
incompetent management.” I
have been unable to find any-
one who has made any state-
ment or implication to this ef-
fect.

A STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT
A letter in last week’s DAVIDSONIAN stated that I made an “absolutely false statement” when I said that the Vagabonds had gone over

My statement to the DAV-
(IDSONIAN reporter in reply
to his question ebout the bud-
get was intended to give es-
surance to all concerned that
edequate financial resources
would be available for the
Necessary expenses of the
dramatics program. It was
certainly not intended to im
ply incompetence on the part
of anyone.

The letter also stated that the
Director of Dramatics was “not
paid a single penny for his Her-
culean labors.” Although he
was offered relief from one-half
of his 12-hour teaching load. Dr.
Goodykoontz chose to teach
three courses. A pro rata share
of his salary was for his’ work
in dramatics.

In addition salaries were paid
to Don Stowell, Assistant Direc-
tor of Dramatics, until his
resignation at the end of the
first semester, and to other
members of the staff, including
several student assistants who
were employed after Mr. Sto-
well's departure.

The. budget for dramatics is

and has been available for
necessary transportation ex-
penses of the Vagabond organi-
zation and checks have been
issued for all requests made for
these purposes. Individuals hav-
ing incurred such expenses will
be reimbursed if they will make
up @ request and have it ap-
proved by the Chairman of the
Vagabond Committee.

in January, at the request
of the Director, the securing
of a secretary end a truck
was approved by me, and
necessary steps were being
taken to provide these at the
time of the resignation of Or.
Goodykoontz.

The typewriter which the col-
lege provided Dr. Goodykoontz
for his use was of course remov-
ed by him from the Fine Arts
Building when he resigned.

I approved a request for a
typewriter for the Vagabonds
but the Chairman of the Vaga-
bonds Committee, Mr. Sailstad,
felt that the typing during the
interim period could be hand-
led satisfactorily on typewriters
elsewhere on the campus or

available im the “typing pool”
at the college. If this does not
adequately care for the needs
of the program a typewriter
will be secured.

The “exhibits” on display
in the Fine Arts Building eri-
ticize the trustees, the presi-
dent, and the church for ea
great many things which are
said to be harmful to the col-
lege.

I am quoted as saying things
which I do not believe that I
gaid, and many which I am sure
that I did not say. For example,
1 did not say that “The Taming
of the Shrew" was a disgusting
play.

A great deal of the material
is directed against the church,
the good friends of the college,
the trustees, and religious lead-
ers, who, it is asserted, are the
ultimate power in the decisions
of the administration of the col-
lege.

it is true that Davidson Col-
lege is legally owned by the
trustees, the majority of
whom are elected by the
Presbyteries in North Caro-

Dr. W. F. Goodykoontz

During the past six years at Davidson, I have worked with hundreds of students in a variety of extracurricular activities, ranging from Sigma
Upsilon and creative writing booklets to the original Beat poetry sessions in Cave Counterpoint, the old Red and Black Masquers, and the Vaga-
bonds. Inevitably, I have become familiar with many types of students in such activities: those who promise and never fulfill; those who appear
a few times and then disappear when the work gets heavy or the pressure strong; those who are content with a mediocre job and are upset
when pushed to do better; those who evince great interest as long as they have a course under you but fade like April frosts when the grades

arein....

And then there are those
rare ones whom every coach or
adviser or director cherishes—
the dedicated ones, those who
work not for the money or
credit or grades but for the
love of the thing itself and who,
in good moments and bad, give
their best. I have been fortun-
ate enough to work with such
students in a number of activi-
ties at Davidson, and I can
never think of them without
that inner warmth that comes
whenever we see unselfishness
or generosity or perseverance
or courage in action.

Three such students—Hans-
ford Epes, Bob Phillips, and
Walter Bost—made possible
the first year of the Vagabonds
in 1960-61 when drama was re-
born at Davidson with seven
mayor productions and four-
teen plays. Two others—Billy
Trotter and Bob Chumbley—
had much to do with keeping
the Vagabond program going
this year.

I do not mean merely that
Trotter had important roles in
four productions during the
summer and fall or that Chum-
bley starred in two, or that this
sprmg Trotter wrote and di-
rected November Requiem and
thet Chumbley has the lead in
Arms and the Man. Actors,
efter all, are usually evailable
(though not often of the quality
of these ¢wo). I mean that when
something needed doing des-
perately to get a play ready,
you. called on Trotter or Chum-
bley (or ane or two others like
them) to do it—knowing that it
would be done. Sound, _ sets,
props, procurement, printing,
mimeographing, make - up,
sweeping, mopping—at. . one
time or another they have done
them all: dirty jobs, trivial
jobs, frustrating jobs—sore,
happy, under stress (and we
had plenty of that)—and at the
sacrifice of leisure, sleep, and
grades.

Of course, you do not get
such dedication without con-
cern for the cause itself; and
the greater the dedication, the
stronger the concern is. And
the stronger the concern, the
more ardent the reaction will
be to anything that seems to
endanger that cause. And so it
was and is with Billy Trotter,
Bob Chumbley, and the Vaga-
bonds.

As I say, I have come to
know a great many different
kinds of students in my work
at Davidson: the cool, the un-
dependable, the mediocre, the
opportunistic—and many of
these were charming young
gentlemen who showed respect
for their elders (at least in pub-
lic) and never asked embarrass-
ing questions or raised a voice
in protest in or out of class,
chiefly because they never car-
ed enough for a cause or an
idea to be concerned asbdout
whet bsppened to it. And I
have known others—hard-work-

ing, conscientious, and self-de-
dicated—admirable young men,
in some respects, but not likely
to do or say anything to endan-
ger a recommendation or a
grade cr any other of the para-
mount interests of the cause
they served, themselves.

And then there are Chum-
ley and Trotter... and those
like them. They are a small
minority on any campus or in
any society—and, I'm: afraid,
a dwindling one at Davidson
—but they exemplify the
very qualities—independent

Dean Johnston

In a few weeks I will have been a teacher at David-
son College for twenty-eight years. Although I have fre-
quently been tempted to protest the numerous misguided
and puerile fulminations which, among many excellent

a

articles, have all too often set the tone and c

racter of

THE 1 'AVIDSONIAN, I have always been able to forbear
and to dismiss them as inevitable. This is my first letter
to TH 2 DAVIDSONIAN, for you reached a new low in
your i sue of April 19 and I can no longer forbear.

I she:l attempt to write with
clarity and conciseness, for I
do not wish to be misunder-

stood. Perhaps the best way to’

be clezr is to be blunt. The
blunt f ct is that I am incensed
that two students at Davidson
College would write such a let-
ter about the President of Dav-
idson College as the letter
which appeared in the issue of
April 19 over the mames of R.
E. Chumbley and W. R. Trotter.
Iam equally incensed that you,
as Editor of THE DAVIDSON-
IAN, would print it.

Passing over the rude rhe
toric and insulting insinua-
tions in which the letter is
couched, and ignoring the
Numerous errers of fact, com
tained therein, | wish to re
cord a vigorous protest that
your peper, the “Editorial
Voice of Davidson College,”

would stoop te such depths as
to print an accusation thet
the President had made an
“absolutely false” statement.
This lenguage is not the fen-
guage that a student may
properly use about the presi-
dent of his college. Such lan-
guage is not only en affront
to the man so accused but an
offense to the entire faculty,
of which he is the tituler
head.

In the name of the dignity
and honor of the faculty, and of
the entire college, I wish to go
on record’ as protesting such ir-
responsible journalism. And I
am mortified to learn that there
are students at this college who
have to be told that their presi-
dent is not a Lar.

thinking, moral idealism,
concerned citizenship, and
the courage to speak out for
what they believe—which, as
§ understand it, are among
the chief aims of a liberal
education. (God help us, our
country, and our world if
they are not!)

I know that some people
were shocked—including peo-
ple who do believe in a liberal
education (passive brand) —by
the letter that Chumbley end
Trotter wrote to THE DAVID-
SONIAN last week. Whether
the factual statements in the
letter are true or false (and I
remain confident that they are
substantially true), this view
apparently holds that the Presi-
dent must be protected, at all
costs, from serious criticism.

I cannot believe that Presi-
dent .Martin accepts this view
of his position; and I hope that
he will rectify the damage done
by last Monday’s charade of
intimidation—directed not only
against Trotter and Chumbley
but against a reporter for THE
DAVIDSONIAN and the editor,
whose sole “offense” was the
courageous exercise of the
freedom which editors tradé-
tionally enjoy in good colleges.
(If anyone were to be subject-
ed to such a session, I modestly
submit my own name. As I told
the Dean of the Faculty before
the meeting, I had eaid all that
Trotter and Chumbley seid—
and more.)

t think « helf hour's con-
versation with Chumbley end
Trotter would convince the
President that they ere nelth-
er rude er irresponsible, des-

line and Floride. These trust-
ees ere responsible for the
policy decisions which must
be meade from time to time.
There has never been a time,
however, when they did not
give the administration and the
faculty opportunity to be heard
on any major issues and decis-
ions.
I do not believe that it is pos-
sible to say that either the
Trustees or the administration

have kept unorthodox ideas off’

the campus or restricted the
right of faculty members to
speak and write without con-
trol. There has been ample evi-
dence of this freedom during
the past year.

It is my belief that Dr.
Goodykoontz and I share many
of the same goals for Davidson
College. I am in favor of every
program which will advance the
ability of students to speak ef-
fectively, think clearly and
quickly, and understand better
the world in. which they live. I
believe that a good drama pro-
gram can be tremendously ef-
fective in achieving these goals.

pite the ardor of their letter,
and that they are, in fact, a-
mong the finest students we
have at Davidson. They are
the kind of students who
achieve greatness, and David-
son will one day be eager to
claim them.

I also hope the President will
accept the invitation of the
YMCA for a forum discussion
of the Vagabond issue and,
more importantly, of the whole
question of creativity at Dav-
idson. I regret that he could
not accept my invitation to
come to the class session last
week at which I first raised
some of the issues pointed to
in the display in the Stowe Gal-
lery classroom. I believe they
are important ones and that
their discussion can contribute,
in some degree at least, to the
achievement of a goal I share

‘with him—a better Davidson.

Bill Goodykoontz

P.S. Looking back over this
letter, I can find only one
phrase which might offend
those well-meaning people who,
seemingly, think the prefix in
post-graduate should refer, to
Emily Post—the phrase, “char-
ade of intimidation.” While it
still seems to me to have been
one—with two deans present,
neither directly concerned with
the carrying out of the drama
program—I am willing to with-
draw the phrase and substitute
a thought out of Shakespeare,
spoken by Isabella to the Phari-
saical Angelo, in Messure for
Measure: “O, it is excellent /

Bob Chumbley - Bill Trotter

During the week that has
elapsed since the publication of
our letter dealing with, among
other and more important mat-
ters, the dispute over the true
Vagabond budget, other factors
have entered our considera-
tions.

No man can justly be held
accountable for what he did
not originate. When President

Martin made his published
statement about the budget, he
was merely passing on what
information he had received. It
was not fair to him to accuse
him of knowledgable misrepre-
sentation of the iswe. The
President cannot in all fainness
be expected to have firsthand
knowledge of the thousand de-

We will not, however, re-
tract our belief thet the bud-
get has been misrepresented
by the college's records. We
admit we cannot prove this
in the face of the evidence
mustered against us. We
have our figures; the college
has its figures. it is our con-
vietion against the Admin-
istration’s and the weight of
authority clearly tilts the bal-
ance against us. Whatever
the cause of the confusion,
we remain convinced that the
official records ere in error.

Furthermore, we resent the
official attitude thet was so
righteously wrathful over our
stand. We have sincerely ex-
pressed out apologies to Dr.
Martin, but we feel that he too
will admit, that when a man

the criticisms may be about
matters of which he is com-
pletely ignorant—details and
little matters which are out of
his contact. This may be unfor-
tunate, but it is pant of being
President, be it President of
Davidson College, or President
of the United States.

We have stated the issue in
terms of the Vagabonds, but we
declare here and now that this is
only a emall part of the matter,
a microcosm in which the big
issues suddenly and, to us, pein-
fully, became focused. The issue
is not the Vegabonds budget, nor
io it even the reliability of the
Administretion’s public state-
ments—these are symptoms,
not the disease iteelf. The ques-
tion is one of intellectual gang-
