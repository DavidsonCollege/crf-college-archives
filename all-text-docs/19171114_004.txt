Mr. Wm. Heathly Scott, °67, died at

DR. WILLIAM MACK.

Wilham Mack was born in Sumter
County, §. C., on October 24, 1865. He
graduated from Davidson in 1883, with
the degrees of M.A., having taken that
degree along with the degree of A.B.,
and ranking second in his class. After
leaving Davidson he taught school for
a while, and then studied law in the
office of his uncle, W. L. Mack, of La-
mar, Missouri. Having completed a
three-year course of law in two years at
the Univedsity of Missouri, and gradu-
ating at the head of his class as well, he
practiced law for eleven years in Mis-
sourt and San Francisco. In 1900 Dr.
Mack accepted an editorial position with
the Edward Thompson Company, of
Northport, a suburb of New York, pub-
lishers of law books. ‘The first fruits of
this work was “Rapalje’s and Mack's
Digest of Railway Decisions.” a stan-
dard work of great repute.

A short time later he changed his resi-
dence to New York, to join the Amer-
ican Law Book Company, with whom
he has been for twelve years. He is
editor-in-chief of the “Cyclopedia of Law
and Procedure,” of which forty volumes
have already been published. This has
assumed rank a among the most authori-
tative of legal works, and has assured
Dr. Mack’s position as a foremost ex-
pounder of legal truth and a clear and
forceful thinker. -

Tho Dr. Mack's work has led him far
away, he has never forgotten the home
interests. His alma mater has been the
recipient of many gifts of books, and
other gifts. He was given the degrees
of LL.D. by Davidson College i in 1907.

J. W. Moore. who has_ been
teaching at the oh “choo! in Winston-

Salem, is now with the N. C. Field Ar-
tillery in training at Camp Sevier,

The following extracts from a news-
paper clipping with reference to ‘W. G.
Morrison, of the class of '16, now an
aviator in France, will be of interest to
the old men on the Hill:

He went over in July, landing at
Liverpool, August 1. Writing to home-
folks under date of August 18, Mr.
Morrison says:

“I've had quite a number of flights
since I’ve been here and am learning
right along. By the time you get this
letter I will be flying alone. It is great
sport and I’m enjoying it thoroly. We
get up about 4 o'clock in the morning,
have coffee and begin flying. At about
9:30 we stop fiving. have breakfast at
tis start flying again about 5 p. m., and
have dinner at 9:30. From 12 to 4 we
sleep and have a little lunch at 4 p. m.
After finishing here we will probably be
sent to an advanced school, so it will be
some time before we go to the front. |
don’t know how long it will be before I
get my commission.”

A few months ago Rev, R. D. Daffin,

03, of the West Brazil Mission. was
given permission to come home on ac-
count of impaired health, with what was
thought to be small prospect of ever be-
ing able to return to the field. He had
bought his ticket to sail on the Rio De
faneiro, but the Brazilian Government
took that steamer to carry the German
ambassador home after her severance of
relations with Germany, and Mr. Daf-
fin’s trip was postponed. He then de-
cided to try a change of climate in Brazil
and went to Sao Sehastiao in the State
af Minas. and in a few weeks found
himself so much improved that he de-
cided to stay there permanently, and is
now in hopes that his health will be en-
tirely restored. His new address will

he San Sebastian de Paraiso. Minas
Geraes, Brazil.
INTERCOLLEGIATE MATCHES

HAVE BEEN CANCELLED

After Manager W. F. Hall had ar-
ranged a trip for the tennis team, on
which matches were to be plaved with
Trinity. North Carolina and Lenoir.
telegrams from Carolina and Lenoir
were received last week stating that they
would be unable to play. There were
no explanations why the matches were
called off. This left but the Trinity
match, and the manager thought best.
for financial reasons. ta postpone this
game. Because of the lateness of the
season it is hardly probable that anv
matches will be plaved with other col-
leges before spring.
