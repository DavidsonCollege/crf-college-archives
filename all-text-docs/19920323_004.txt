from it.” She suggested that SAE
should be “guided through reha-
bilitation of the fraternity,” and
that this measure would “help the
campus as a whole.”

Wallace goes on to say that
“no doctrine of a national frater-
nity encourages harassment or dis-
honorable conduct. They encour-
age respectand responsibility. The
fraternities themselves do not en-
courage dishonorable behavior.
The problem needs to be addressed,

but it needs to be remedied by
other methods than those suggested
in the report.”

Rusk held a forum last Thurs-
day to attempt to understand what
the report means, it’s conse-
quences, and to express personal
feelings of Rusk members, so that
Wallace can accurately represent
Rusk’s view at the Patterson Court
Council.

Steven Lilly of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon stated that “the investiga-
tion of the social system at
Davidson was and is necessary,
but by nomeans has the committee
solved all of the problems at
Davidson.”. Lilly believes the
Report to be “extremely biased”
and stated that it “singles out the
fraternity system as harmful to

. Davidson, and attempts to paint
SAE as the worst” problem in the
system. Lilly also pointed out that
one committee member signed the
statement published by A.T. Miller
on February 4, 1992, which shows
abias against SAE, and the Report
“synthesized only one view of the
Court and of SAE.”

Lilly also stated that the com-
mittee was under a “time con-
straint.” Lilly’s reaction to this is
“when you are investigating a
matter of paramount importance,
you should investigate it thor-
oughly.” Lilly stated that it was

not investigated thoroughly, citing
that members of CCRL, the Union
Board, the SGA, and the PCC
were not interviewed, and that the
committee “looked at one side of a
many sided issue.”

Regarding the allegations and
recommendations for his own fra-
ternity, SAE, Lilly stated that the
recommended suspension “indi-
rectly abolished SAE. No frater-
nity can last two years with no
pledges”. Lilly was also -disap-
pointed that the committee “made
noreference whatsoever tothe pro-

active steps that the SAE house has::

taken during this semester to im-
prove relations with other houses
and within SAE.” He sighted their
improved relations with Rusk
House, which has “re-voted and
decided to continue having parties
with SAE”. Lilly sites this as “a
good example of how two houses
can work together and avoid a
potentially hostile situation.”

Lilly also pointed out that “no
reference was made” to the “Five
Point Plan” printed in The
Davidsonian on March 2, 1992,
“almost two weeks before the
committee’s report appeared.” In
closing, Lilly stated that “in es-
sence, the committee has inter-
viewed people, interpreted their
views, and acted on those views,
creating tentative sanctions with-
out taking the time or making the
effort to hear the other side of the
story.”

Lilly, on behalf of the mem-
bers of SAE is “more than willing
to accept full responsibility for the
thing [they] have done. The indi-
viduals have come. forward and
been dealt with.” Lilly used the
analogy of a family member who
has done wrong and has been
punished, and stated that “there is
no need for the entire family to be
punished as a whole. That is ex-
actly what the committee is doing
to SAE.”

U.S. Poet Laureate, Brodsky,
to Visit Campus on March 30

By David Thompson

On Monday, March 30, Jo-
seph Brodsky will be reading se-
lections of his poetry at Davidson.
Brodsky won the Nobel Prize for
literature in 1987 and is currently
the Poet Laureate of the United
States. Brodsky will be reading his
poetry both in Russian and in Eng-

‘lish at 7:30 p.m. in Hodson Hall.

The event, sponsored by Dean of
Faculty Robert Williams and the
English Department, is both free
and open to the public.
According to Harry Thomas,
Associate Professor of English at
Davidson, Brodsky’s success as a
poet is due in great part to his
lacking a formal education. Un-
willing to hear any more “drivel,”
Brodsky left school at 15.
Brodsky’s freedom from the trap-
pings of classroom education keeps

his verse markedly individual.
“The poems speak with his dis-
tinctive idiom as a man,” said
Thomas.

. Brodsky was born in Lenin-
grad, and worked a series of odd
jobs after leaving school. In 1964
Brodsky was sentenced to five
years hard labor in northern Russia
for the crime of “social parasit-
ism” (the refusal to hold a steady
job). Thanks to protests both within
the Soviet Union and abroad, how-
ever, Brodsky was released after
18 months. Brodsky next encoun-
tered the Sovietauthorities in 1972,
when he was told to leave the
country.

Although Brodsky was .only
32 at the time of his exile, he was
already known as the great poet of
his generation. His dedication to
writing and his unmistakably

unique style have earned him
popular as well as critical acclaim.
Beforeheevenarrived in the United
States, Brodsky had been offered a
post at the University of Michigan
as poet-in-residence. Reporters
gathered at the Nobel Academy in
1987 greeted the announcementof
his earning the prize for literature
with cheers.

Brodsky’s works in English,
published by Farrar Strauss &
Giroux and Penguin Books, in-
clude three volumes of poetry,
Selected Poems (1973), A Part of
Speech (1980), and To Urania
(1988); a collection of essays and
memoirs, Less Than One (1986);
anda play Marbles (1990). Since
1981, Brodsky has lived in New
York City.

Davidson to Welcome German Professor

By Will Boye

Next semester, Davidson’s
German Department will welcome
a new addition while simultane-
ously ending its own homogene-
ity. Dr. Elisabeth Waghall, who is
currently teaching at Washington
University in St. Louis, will serve
next year as Davidson’s only fe-
male, full-time German professor.

Waghall (pronounced Vogue-
Hail), originally from Sweden, is
fluent in German and English in
addition to her native language. In
1986, after garnering her Masters
degrees in Swedish and Teaching
at universities in her own country,
she was offered a position at Wash-
ington University as an instructor
of Swedish. It was a proposition,
says Waghall, that was too inter-
esting to refuse. “It was a great

SAE” and is “extremely unpro-
fessional.” Originally, Lilly said,
SAE supported the committee
because “we thought they would
avoid scapegoating any one
group.”

Lilly pointed outthatthe words
“perceive,” “allege,” and “be-
lieve” are used 15 times through-
out the report, ten times in con-
junction with SAE. . He is disap-
pointed thatthe committee reached
its conclusions based largely on
speculation and opinion, rather
than concrete evidence.

In particular, Lilly is most
disturbed with the Dean of Fac-
ulty and chairman of the select
committee, Robert Williams, Lilly
_said he has “serious problems with
Dean Williams” because prior to
this report Williams had indicated
his support of fraternities on
campus. When Lilly attempted to
talk with Williams following the
publication of the report, Lilly says
that Williams told him that he did
not wantto talk to him any further.
Lilly also questioned the wisdom
of selecting the Dean of Faculty to
serve as chairman of a committee
dealing with student life.

In a letter to the Davidson
community which is printed on
pages 8 and 9 of this issue as a paid
advertisement, Lilly expressed his
opinion that the committee failed
to interview a truly representative
portion of the student body. He
points out that the 29 students in-
terviewed constitute less than 1.9
% of the student body. Lilly char-
acterized this paid letter as an “‘at-
tempt to acknowledge where we
(SAE) made mistakes” and “not an
effort to exonerate itself (SAE)
from any guilt.” |

Lilly also expressed his disap-
pointment in the committee’s fail-
ure to let SAE explain its “side of
the story.” He said, “It’s hard fora
group to make a change and ac-
knowledge its faults, when you’re
not given a voice.” Lilly said he

invites those with questions or -

concems to approach SAE mem-
bers directly.

Last week the Rusk house
voted to retract their earlier sanc-
tion against SAE. On February 5
the house had voted to suspend co-
sponsorship of social functions
with SAE because'of several spe-

. cific incidents and a general feel-

ing of fear feltby members of Rusk
toward SAE’s at Patterson Court
functions. Susan Wallace, Rusk
president, said, “After a house

&

meeting with a delegation from

SAE present for discussion and -

questioning, where we had achance
to openly express our concerns,
demands explanations and action
regarding them, and hear the dele-
gation’s genuine commitment to
address the allegations facing their
fraternity, we thoughtfully evalu-
ated our decision, coming to a
consensus to uphold the motion
with the added option to re-vote in
six weeks,”

Lilly cited SAE’s recent deal- |

ings with Rusk as a “perfect ex-
ampleofhow two groupscan work
together and resolve differences
withoutbeing unfair toeither side.”
He said it was “important that it
was handled solely by students.”
The recent Rusk vote is also sig-
nificant, Lilly says, because it
shows that SAE has taken respon-
sibility for its actions, while the
committee implied that SAE has
been reluctant to do this.

Finally, Lilly said that the na-
tional SAE organization has been
an aid to the Davidson chapter. He
says that the national group has
been supportive and has attempted
to serve as a liason. between the
house and the school.

Meanwhile, Terry has tempo-

rarily suspended all activities ex-
cept eating at SAE.

challenge to come teach students
that were not only strangers to the
language,” she says, “but foreign
to me as well.”

While teaching at the univer-
sity, Waghall began working upon
her doctorate in German, a lan-
guage in which she had become
proficient due toa number of years
she had spent in the country as a
child. Waghall says she finds
Davidson and its small, liberal-
arts environment appealing be-

cause it reminds her of the school
she attended in Germany after
graduating from high school. “I
find it nice to be able to return to
something smaller,” she says.
“After my first visit (to Davidson),
itwasn’tadifficultchoice tomake.”

Waghall will be teaching both
elementary and intermediate Ger-
man Classes, as well as an upper-
level seminar in her field of inter-
est, Medieval and Early Modern
German Literature.
