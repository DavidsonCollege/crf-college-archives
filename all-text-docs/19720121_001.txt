Spencer To

Fee Decision To V.P.’s

By ALEC HOON
Asst. Managing Editor

After weeks of uncertainty, it
has been decided that the final
decision co the comprehensive
fee will be made jointly by the
Vice President For Academic
Affairs John H. Bevan and the
Vice President For Finance and
Development C. David Cornell.

On Tuesday, the Student Life
Committee (SLC) drew up a
recommendation for College
President Samuel R. Spencer,
advising the deletion of the
board bill from the comprehen-
sive fee.

Spencer will take the recom-
mendation and give it to Bevan
and Cornell to make the final
decision.

“T will give the SLC propos-
al to my two Vice Presidents
who will review it. I will do
nothing except to endorse their
recommendation,’ Spencer said.

For several weeks, many stu-
dent leaders wondered if
their repeated pleas for recon-
sideration of the board clement
of the fee would be considerd
by the administration.

“There has been continued in-
transigence on the part of the
college administration to
sider student objections to the
comprehensive fee,” SGA Pres-
ident Ralph Peeples stated.

“No credible rationale has vet
been presented, not even to the
faculty, as regards the fee. The
same nebulous definitions and
circuitous reasoning eNist to-
day, just as they did in Sep-
tember regarding this issue,” he
added.

vestigate student

Bevan and Cornell held a

ing scemed to come out of this
meeting.

The SLC decided to look into
the issue because thevyy became
concerned about the fee's effect
on students.

“The SLC became concerned
with the comprehensive fee be
cause they believed that it was
affecting the living patterns and
morale ol students,” he = said.

“The specific point with which
some members of the commit
tee took issue was over the
question of a compulsory board
bill in the comprehensive fee,”
Terry. said.

The result of the SLC consul-
tations was the recommenda-
tion sent to Spencer.

Cornell indicated that he and
Bevan will meet in the near fu-
ture and hammer out a deci-
sion,

Bevan stated that as of now,
he supports the fee as it stands.
“T haven't heard new ar-
guments that would change my
mind about the comprehensive

any

fee,’ he said.
“T support the fee first be-
cause it would simplify book-

keeping and give the business
office a better base for making
budgetary demands and judg-
ments.”

“Another factor is the idea of
Davidson as a residential col
which means that it is ex-
pected to provide housing and
feeding arrangements for all or
students. This is
trying to do with

Bevan explained.

As Bevan outlined the plan
as it now stands, it will be op-
erated by the business office.
The business office will bill
each student the standard fee

of 33,165. except in certain speci
fic cases.

An example of one of these
cases would be the deduction of
the room rent from the bill of
students residing off campus.

Other deductions include one
for those participating in for-
cign study programs, those who
withdraw from school, and those
withdraw from school, and
those who are excused or un-
able to eat on campus at cer-
tain meals.

Any other exceptions will be
handled on an individual basis
by the Dean of Students, who
will decide on the basis of the
student's request.

What could tuim out to be a
serious honor offense marred
the final elections of the school
vear Wednesday, according to
Supervisor of Elections — Bill
Lear.

Investigation of the voter sign-
up sheet revealed that two of
the signatures listed were next
to the names of people who are
no lcuger Davidson students.

After the initial balloting
Tuesday, the necessary 50 per
cent of the vote had not been
secured by the top three Junior
Class candidates, thus calling

In the Tuesday: election Mitch-

ell Purvis pulled 114 votes
(20.47 per cent), Hall Whit-
worth received 82 (14.72 per
cent), Bo Phillips 81 (14.54 per

cent), and John Knox 68 (12.21

per cent).

The other candidates in that
race, along with the number of
votes each received, were: Dan

26: Murray Hawkinson—26;
James Shepherd—24; and Herb

In the 1un-offs Wednesday,
Purvis secured 148 votes, Whit-
werth got 144, Knox came up
with 108. and Phillips with 107.
The indication would be that
Purvis was the new class presi-
dent and that Whitworth and
Knox were his fellow senators.

However, discovery of the
false signatures meant that this
Was not the case.

Lear and SGA President Ralph
Peeples conferred and decided
that the election would have to
be run again Tuesday, January
25, due to the invalidation of the
results.

“Bill and I made the decision
to rerun the election regardless
of the outcome,” said Peeples.
“It's a matter of principle;
something like this can’t be al-
lowed to happen.”

Dean of Students Will Terry
commented, “It's shocking to
realize that Davidson students
would seek to defraud an elec-
tion. It is certainly a violation
of the spirit of the Honor Sys-

2

tem and the Code of Responsi-
bility and all it stands for, and
it might well be a violation of
these technically.

“It bears investigation and
possibly even prosecution,” he
said.

Si:udent Hearing Committee
Chairman Duff Bruce empha-
sized that, ‘‘though we've never
had a case like this before, any-
thing that cenflicts with stand-
ard balloting procedure could
be punishable as a violation of
the Code of Responsibility.

“It seems to me that some
sort. of penalty, say, a fine,
could reasonably be imposed,”
he said.

Lear added, “I'm really dis
appointed, not because the elec-
tion has to be run again, but
because it shows that there’s a
possibility for something to in-
validate the results of a system

that I don’t think we can im-
prove much upon,
“There are ways,’ he con-

tined, “thai security can be im-
proved, such as requiring that
students show their I.D.’s_be-
fore voting, but in terms of
what that would do to the turn-
out and ccufusion of elections,
systems like that are imprac
tical.”

Peeples indicated that he was
going to personally apologize to
all four candidates, and con-
cluded, ‘“‘We’re going to keep
rerunning the election until the
results are completely valid.”

Other elections held Tuesday
were for senators from the oth-
er classes and to determine
