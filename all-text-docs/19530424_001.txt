WAYS To Discuss
D. C. Blood Drives

Radio Station WAYS in Char-
lotte will broadcast a documentary
type program on Saturday, April
25, at 5:30 p. m.

The program will feature the
story of the recent blood drive
conducted on the Davidson campus
and features an interview with
Leroy Mims, a member of the
senior class and Col. Davis, PMS&T
of the college.

The program which was written
and produced by Tad Currie, a
member of the senior class and
an announcer for WAYS, tells of
the need for human blood and how
the people of Davidson have been
meeting this need through their
annual blood drives.

The main feature of the program
is an on-the-spot recording of a
person actually going through the
process of blood donation and of
the.z-reaction to the entire pro-
cess, ;

The broadcast is noteworthy in
that it comes at a time when the
Charlotte Blood Bank has sent out
an emergency call for blood since
its entire supply was shipped to
Dillon, S. C. to be used in the train
wreck that killed four and injured
over one hundred and twenty-five.

The broadcast will also salute
the ROTC Department, Scabbard
and Blade and Omicron Delta
Kappa for the work that they have
done to make these blood drives
so successful.

SCHOLARSHIP MAIN
TOPIC AT RATIONAL
0.0.K. CONVENTION

Dr. A. V. Goldiere served as of-
ficial Davidson representative to
the national convention of Omicron
Delta Kappa. He made his report
to the local chapter at its last
meeting.

The convention was held at Roa-
noke, Virginia, and was attended
by 276 members, 50 of which were
faculty members. The session be-
gan at 2:00 p. m. Thursday after-
noon, April 16, and was adjourned
Saturday afternoon.

Serving as principle speakers for
the occasion were Dr. J. C. Baker,
President of Ohio U., Dr. F. P.
Gaines, President of W. & L., and
Dean Marten ten Hoor of the
University of Alabama. All three
stressed leadership.

Besides the full convention meet-
ings, the delegates were divided
into eleven committees in order
to permit more thorough discus-
sion of different problems and
practices.

Dr. Goldiere served on the Policy
and Law Committee out of which
came the convention's main topic of
discussion. Many of the delegates
wanted to tighten up the scholas-
tic requirement for membership
that states that a member must be
in the upper 35% of his class.
This requirement is necessary in
order for the organization to re-
main in the National Association
of Honorary Fraternities. Although

no definite action was taken at the

convention, a by-law for stricter
scholastic qualifications will be cir-
culated among the local chapters
for approval.

Vespers & Chapel

Sunday, April 26th, Vespers will
be conducted by Rev. Arnold S.
Nash, head of the Department of
Religion at the University of North
Carolina.

Mondey, April 27th, the chapel
devotional will be conducted by
Bob Wearn of the senior class.

Tuesday, April 28th, Rev. Samuel
W. Newell, Jr., pastor of the First
Presbyterian Church in Davidson,
will address the student body.

Wednesday, April 29th, chapel
will be in charge of Mercer Kepler
of the Senior class.

Thursday, April 30th, will be
YMCA day as usual.

was elected President of the new
Interfraternity Council. Other of-
ficers include Bob Owens as Trea-
surer and Joe Neisler as Secretary.

The biggest problem facing Char-
lie and the new council will be
that of setting up a rushing pro-
gram to go along with the new rule
of freshmen eating in the College
Union for the first semester.

At the present time, four solu-
tions are in sight, but no definite
one has been decided upon.

Rushing could start the Monday
before the opening of school, that
is, a few days after the beginning
of Orientation for freshmen, or
the fraternities could continue with
the same program that was set up
by Lawrence Erwin and his coun-
cil last year.

Another solution would be to
have second semester rushing, but
this program is very debatable as
to the good that it will do the fra-
ternity and rushing systems.

A new idea into this field is that
of having divided rushing such
that fraternities split up the rush-
ing days over a period of several
months, having one or two rushing
days a month.

Hassell comes from Charlotte,
and during his three years here he
has been a member of the Y Cab-
inet, being head of the committee
on publications. He is a member of
the Male Chorus and Eumanean
Literary Society, and is the Inter.
fraternity Council representative
for Kappa Sigma social fraternity.

Charlie stated that next year he
opes to have several planned meet-
ings with the faculty committee

on fraternities in order to promote}

a better understanding between
faculty and fraternity members.

Seniors Plan
Study Abroad

Professor G. B. Watts, Fulbright
Advisor for Davidson College an-
nounced today that he had received
a letter from David Wodlinger,
Director of U. S. Student Program
of the Institute of International
Education giving the names of the
Davidson graduates who have been
nominated by the National Selec-
tion Committee to the Board of
Foreign Scholarships.

Mac Bulgin, Herman Bell, James
Jervey, David McElroy, and Charles
Davis received word today that
they had been nominated for Ful.
bright Scholarships in foreign
countries next year.

Mac Bulgin was nominated for
the United Kingdom, and had the
additional honor of being the first
choice of the North Carolina State
Committee. Herman Bell received
the Germany offer, with Jinks Jer-
vey to be his alternate. David Mc-
Elroy was named alternate for
Austria, and Charles Davis was
nominated to go to Italy.

Two of these men have already
received tempting offers of scholar-
ships from other bodies, due to the
long lapse of time between the
completion of recommendations by
the National Selection Committee
and the final announcement by the
Board of Foreign Scholarships.

Mr. Wodlinger wrote Professor
Watts on April 8, 1953, telling him
that the chances of all these David-
son candidates are “excellent.” He
went. so far as to say that Mr.
Bulgin has already been “placed
by the United States Education
Commission in London.”

Sig Upsilon Adds

Sigma Upsilon bid six new un-
dergraduate members to its roster
in its bi-monthly meeting last
Thursday, April 16. These men
will be initiated in a formal cere-
mony that will be held at Erwin
Lodge on May 7.

The new members are: Vereen
Bell, Bob Hayes, Norman Johnson,
Moody Smith, Mac Williamson, and
Ronnie Wilson. The first meeting
which these men will attend is that
of Thursday, April 30.

The May 7 initiation ceremony
will be preceded by the annual
Faculty Feed and will be an out-
door picnic supper that is pre-
pared by the faculty members.

Band Concert Ends Festival Week

Concluding the first week of the sixth annual Fine Arts
Festival, a concert by the Davidson College Concert Band will
be held tonight at 8:15 o’clock in the David Ovens College

Union Displays Art
By Italian Painters

On display in the College Union
until May 17 is a collection of six-
teen rare paintings of the Italian
Renaissance. These valuable paint-
ings have been loaned to Davidson
for the Fine Arts Festival by the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in
New York. ;

Perhaps the most outstanding
picture of the group is a portrait of
Benedetto Varchi, the Historian,
done by Tintoretto in 1518. Tin-
toretto is noted as the man who
painted the world’s largest pic-
ture, “Paradise,” which is 84’ by 34'
and ‘hangs in the Doge's Palace in
Venice.

Contemporary with Tintoretto
was Veronese. The subject in his
“Portrait of a Woman” on display
here is in typical Venetian Renais-
sance dress with many jewels and
rings.

Veronese’s love for the ornate
caused him to be called before the
Inquisition for painting religious
subjects in too gaudy a fashion.

Another Venetian, Lorenzo Lot-
to, is outstanding in the exhibition
for his “Portrait of a Man.” Be-
sides being supreme in portraiture
the artist is noted for his pious
conservatism, for Lotto would paint
no one who did not have a re-
spectable character. .

In connection with Renaissance
Art the Art Department will pre-
sent two films in the Union Mon-
day night at 8:15. The first, a color
film on the Eisenheim Altar Piece
by Grunewald, will be accompanied
by Hindemith’s “Matthias der
Maler,” a composition inspired by
the altar-piece. The second is
“Paintings by Rubens.”

Additionally, on Wednesday
night at 8:15, Dr. Clemens Som-
mer, art Historian at the University
of North Carolina, will speak on art
of the Renaissanée and show slides.

BEAVER CLUB PLANS
NEW CLOTHES DRIVE

Plans for this year’s senior auc-
tion and another clothes drive were
announced yesterday by Herschel
Allen, president of the Beaver Club.

The tentative date for the auc-
tion was set at Thursday, May 14,
and all articles to be put up for
auction may be presented to either
Dickie Davis or Ben Craig.

A spring clothes drive will pro-
bably be carried out during exams,
with the hope of bettering the re-
sults of last fall’s drive. Seventy-
five pounds of clothes from that
drive have been sent to the Philip-
pines; and one hundred pounds
have already arrived in Korea, with
another fifty pounds on the way.
