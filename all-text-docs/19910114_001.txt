Students Protest U.S. Involvement In
Middle East On Campus, In Capital

Peace Vigil Held
Tuesday In Front
Of Chambers

By Meredith Hammons

In response to the escalating
threat of war in the Middle East,
people have been holding peace
vigils across the United States.
Here at Davidson, vigils have been
sponsored by the Davidson Friends
(Quaker) Meeting Group.

Dr. Lauren Yoder, a member
of the Friends group and Director
of the Center for Special Studies,
estimated that 50 to 60 studerits
and faculty members have attended
the vigils, which consist of 15
minutes of silent meditation. “A
vigil isan expression of solidarity,
an expression of hope. . .'acoming
together of people whoare seeking
peace,” said senior Molly Graver,

a member of Davidson’s Political

Action Group.

Yoder said that the group was
notepposed to the the U.
Saudi Arabia. “We’re not demon-
strating against anything; it is a
vigil for peace. We are hoping that
the soldiers can come home with-
out bloodshed. We’re supportive
of human life,” he said. Graver
said that many of the people hold-
ing vigils across the country were
family members of soldiers.

Graver ‘said that one of the
groups goals was to encourage a
coming-together of the campus and
community because “apathy is a

group wanted to encourage people
to think about the situation in the
Middle East and, if they had
strong feelings about the U. S.
government decision to go to war,
to write to their representatives in
Congress. - :

At the first vigil, the group
passed out names, addresses, and
phone numbers of these represen-
tatives, but they did not do soat the
second meeting because they felt

that writing was an individual
decision.

Yoder suggested that people —
read as much background infor-
mation of the situation as they can
in order to understand how com-
plicated it is. “We should also
think for ourselves and not be
caught up in the rhetoric that poli-
ticians give. Sometimes they put
themselves in a political box and

Black Students Call For Reforms

By Lisa Gerrard

Rafael Candelario recalls his

firstday asa freshman at Davidson.
He arrived with more expectations
than most others in his class, since
he had spent four summers here
with the Love of Learning pro-
gram for minority high school
students.

“T guess I expected a feeling of
brotherhood and concern like we
had foreach other at Love of Leam-
ing,” he said. “But when I got here
it was different,

_ “People were looking at me
like I was weird. I looked around
and I realized that I was one black
person surrounded by 500 white
people.”

Minority students at predomi-

nantly white colleges bear a bur-
den of difference that causes them
frustration and anger, reports a
study issued in December from a
‘’ survey of more than 5,000 students

schools.. The study reveals that
minority students on a given cam-
pus are likely to feel under-served
and under-appreciated. ,

The report also indicates that
half the black students on predomi-
nantly white campuses would not
select the same school again.

In response to this survey,

several Davidson students said they ,

also question their decision to at-
tend a mostly white school. “Some
days it’s the best decision I ever
made and other days it’s the worst,”
said senior Terry Hines, president
of the Black Student Coalition. .

Hines and others believe that

broad reforms must come before a
majority of black students feel
comfortable on this campus.

To more effectively address
the needs of black students, the
administration helped establish the
Task Force on Racial/Ethnic Con-

cerns in 1984. Since then, Davidson -
has hired a black assistant c

___at 40 colleges and universities in
14 states. i

In North Carolina, the South-
erm Regional Education Board
administered the survey in five

lain, a black assistant dean of
admissions for minority. recruit-.
ment and a black assistant dean of
students.

As of the fall of 1990, there
were five full-time black profes-
sors, four full-time black adminis-
trators, and 71 black students en-
rolled out of approximately 1,500
on-campus -- about five percent of

-the student bedy. (There are also
~ 63 international students and 19

Hispanic-American students.)
In an interview on Saturday,
seven black students said that the
administration must make an even
stronger commitment to meeting
the special needs of minority stu-
dents. They offer the following
suggestions to improve conditions
for blacks:
+ Davidson should recruit more
black students. In the Fall 1990
edition of the Davidson Journal,

Guilty in Honor Trial

By Mark D. Puckett
During the middle of exam
week, the honor council brought
to trial one honor offense. The stu-
dent requested an open hearing.

What follows are the details of that .
*’ trial.

The student will remain
nameless.

. Thestudenttook an exam, after
which, he walked downstairs to
put his exam materials in the enve-
lope. His books and notes had been
in the lobby of Chambers where he
had been studying earlier. (Other
students had also been studying in
the lobby, for the rain had disal-
lowed the normal cramming on the
outside steps that usually takes
place.) He went to where his books
were in the lobby, exam envelope
and exam in hand, The student
needed to get a postcard. On the

postage-paid postcard, it informed
the professor that the student was .
on a:scholarship through his fa-
ther’s company and that it was
necessary for the professor to pencil

_in the final grade on the postcard

and send it to the company before
January 1 for scholarship process-
ing purposes. He had included the
same card in other exam enve-
lopes.

When he could not find the
postcard, he set down his exam and
envelope where his notes were and
shuffled through them. In the mess -
of papers he picked up a page of
notes from a previous class discus-
sion and placed them in the enve-
lope and left out the examination
