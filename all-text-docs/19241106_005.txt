Writes Letter to Student Body

)
Zakow, Chekiang, Sept. 24, 1924.
Dear Everybody, i. e., Student Body :

It’s hard to realize that for more than
three weeks you have been practicing foot-
ball! It's harder to realize, tho, that by the
time you get this epistle almost half the sea-
son will be over! And I won't hear the re-
sult, of a single game till the whole string
ha. been played.

Yes, China is a long way off! And by the
time you've been on the way a month, and
realize ‘that you are just one-third the way
around the world; why!
look so big after all!

America doesn't
It's worth ‘a whole
lifetime of experiences in America just to
come to China. One (at least I didn't)
doesn't realize how absurdly provincial Amer-
icans are till one gets in a foreign country—
and one so entirely different as China is.

The college is located Zakow, a suburb of
Hangchow and is truly beautifully situated.
It is on the banks of a broad river that winds
back and forth between mountains on all
sides. I am going to try to get a picture of
the place and send it to Mr. Williams in or-
der that he can put it some place,

On arrival, we took a taxi for Kamakura,
where is located the largest Buddhist idol in
the world—and a famous bathing beach. The
latter was by a long shot the more attractive.

make the men wear handkerchiefs as bathing
suits (a recent enactment necessary for pro-
tection again sunburn) and provide bath-
“sheds” (without doors) where all sexes can
don their “bathing-suits.” They have just
as good a bath as we do with all our fancy
suits.

From Kamagura we took a train to Tokio
and saw the American element. My compan-
ion knew some friends and we spent the
evening with them till nine—and by that
time four were under the table—and_ the
boat sailed the next morning.

them all made (not the shops, of course)
and it was some sight. My pocketbook was
getting a little too weak to indulge.
After leaving Kobe we sailed the Inland
Sea and thence across the Yellow, into
Shanghai. To express one’s sentiments and
opinions of China after a residence of only
one month would be rather bold—I must
