Flutie Seems Shoo-in For Heisman Trophy

By STEVE BYERS

Okay, so Bo Jackson has separated »

his shoulder and therefore won’t win
the Heisman. Navy’s Napolean
McCallum, another strong candidate,
was also eliminated last week when he
sustained a season-ending injury.
Miami quarterback Bernie Kosar bid
farewill to his chances last Saturday
after his dismal performance in the loss
to Florida State, his second such poor
showing this year. And that’s all it
takes: Bye, bye Bernie.

Who’s left? Well, Pitt tackle Bill
Fralic is being pumped as a Heisman
candidate, but Fralic’s got a problem.
The N. Y. Athletic Club doesn’t usu-
ally reward losses (Pitt is 0-3), and the

bad games, Flutie is a shoo-in against
this relatively weak field. Almost
single-handedly he has taken BC from
a perennial doormat to a high national
ranking (Sth in this week’s AP poll)
and victories over such powerhouses
as Alabama and Clemson. :

,~ He is no fluke. His size and speed
give him an extra dimension most col-
lege (and pro, too) quarterbacks lack
— the ability to avoid defensive line-
men. Combine this with a surprisingly
strong arm and an uncanny knack for
reading defenses, and you have a great
QB on your hands. Add a touch of flair
— he excels in pressure situations and
come-from-behind wins — and you
have a legitimate and deserving Heis-
man candidate.

I saw Flutie for the first time this
year last Sunday on the UNC Coaches
Show. The highlights of the UNC-BC
game of the night before were little
more than a promo film for Flutie. He
literally picked apart the Carolina sec-
ondary, throwing for 354 yards and six
touchdowns, and he didn’t even play
the fourth quarter. When the defense
prevented him from passing normally ,
he simply threw sidearm or half-threw,,

chances of them picking an offensive
lineman are slim and none. Three
prominent tailbacks are still in conten-
tion: Ohio State’s Keith Byars, Neb-
raska’s Jeff Smith and Tennessee’s
Johnnie Jones.

But this year’s Heisman Trophy
belongs to a 5’9” quarterback who
plays football for Boston College. It is
Doug Flutie’s to win or lose, as of right
now. Barring an injury or a string of

half-pitched for touchdowns.

If the Heisman voters are serious
about choosing college football’s most
valuable player, few have done more
for the game than Flutie.

Other Business

Now that I’m off my soapbox, let
me address some other recent news in
the world of sports. Congratulations to
Pete Johnson, who has the distinction
of being the only running back to pass
the Miami Dolphin’s physical this sea-
son. Chuck Muncie and Rickey Young
were axed by the lab boys, who found
traces of drugs in their urine.

Speaking of axes, my compliments
to the University of Florida for telling
football Coach Charley Pell to take a
walk. Pell is responsible for over /50
violations at both Clemson and
Florida. While I'm sure a lot of major
college coaches cut some corners, 150
violations is ridiculous. Considering
that he even authorized spying on
some opponents’ practices, look for
Pell to turn up in Central America in
the near future.

Monday Night Football just isn’t
the same without Howard Cosell —

‘Gooden should win the Cy Young if

it’s better. O. J. is an adequate re-
placement, but I hope that ABC can
lure John Madden away from CBS
next year. Can you imagine the sound
effects in the booth with Madden and
“Dandy” Don Merideth together? By
the way, ABC’s innovation, the re-
verse angle replay, is helpful. Their
new gimmick, however, which details
a team’s drive on a miniature field, is
superfluous.

Congratulations and best of luck to
the Chicago Cubs, who deserved the
N.L. East title after a 39-year
drought. Cubs second baseman Ryne
Sandberg should be voted the N. L.'s
MVP this year, and pitcher Rick
Sutcliffe has a good shot at the Cy
Young. Mets rookie sensation Dwight

Sutcliffe doesn’t. In the American
League, my vote would go to Tigers
reliever Willie Hernandez for both
awards.

Quote of the Week:
“The Butler did it again.”
— Georgia Coach Vince Dooley on
kicker Kevin Butler's 60-yard field
goal that beat Clemson, 26-23.

‘Hockey Loses 3 At Longwood

Lou Hamilton, who injured her knee and
may miss the rest of the season.

“We didn’t play with confidence,”
Coach Patty Daley said. “Against both
High Point and St. Mary's we didn’t con-
trol the ball, we didn’t mark people, and
we failed to improve. The first half of the
Longwood game was fantastic, but the
second half was the longest half of my
life with the injuries and the score. But I
look for us to bounce back. It won't be
easy, but we're a better team than last
weekend showed.”

Davidson's field hockey team hit a
dry spell at a poor time. The Cats had
hoped their trip to the Longwood Tour-
nament would improve their 2—2 record,
but instead they lost three straight games.

High Point started Davidson in the
wrong direction by beating the Cats 2-0.
Mount St. Mary’s then beat Davidson 4—
1. Longwood ended the weekend by de-
feating Davidson 6—0. To make matters
worse, Davidson lost senior co-captain

a Stanley H. Kaplan

Men’s, Women’s Teams
Open Cross Country Season

By ANDY BARRON

Davidson's men’s and women’s
cross country teams opened their seasons
here last Saturday. The men’s team
finished fourth among the six participat-
ing teams while the women took second
place out of the four competing women’s
teams.

Duke won both team competitions
easily. The Duke women were lead by
Ellen Reynolds, who won with a time of
19:13 for the three-mile course. Dave
Mitchell led the Duke men by winning
the men’s race ina time of 25:42 for the
five-mile course. Both of these times are
new records because the courses were
new.

“I'm glad to get that first meet over
with,” said sophomore Trey Jammes.
“The first one is the toughest. Now that
the team is done with the tough one, |
think we will start to improve.”

The men’s team was led by sopho-
more Greg Foreman, who finished

eighth in a time of 26:47. The other four .

runners for Davidson that counted to-
ward the team score were junior Taylor
Simpson, who finished [Sth, junior
Frank Hague (23), junior Bob Watkins
(24), and Jammes (31). The team scores
were Duke 20, Emory 75, Lynchburg
79, Davidson 92, Campbell 99, and
Catawba with no score.

“The heat and the dust were tough.”
Watkins said. “It was also difficult run-
ning on a new course because we didn't
have any real home course advantage.”

Senior captain Jean Webb, who
finished fourth in a time of 20:53, led the
women’s team. The rest of the top five on

the team were freshmen Kappa Peddy
(9), junior Judy Dalton (10), senior Suzie
Dresser (13), and senior Arienae Cheek
(15). The team scores were Duke 17.
Davidson 51, Campbell 62, and Saler)
101. The team missed senior Sarah Pat
terson, who did not participate due to
sore ankles.

“Em really optimistic about the sea
.” Webb said. “We've gota good deal
of talent and everyone is working hard. It
we can stay healthy, [ think we will have
a great season.”

Both Davidson teams will compete
tomorrow here at Davidson. The women
will run at 10:30 a.m. against Appalac
hian State and Western Carolina. The
men’s race should begin at about 11:15
a.m. with Davidson hosting Appalachian
State, Western Carolina, The Citadel,
and Furman.

“If we can get the top nine runners to-
ward the front of the pack, we will be a
very competitive team,” said Hague
“The competition on Saturday should be
intense. The people who come out and

‘watch us should see a great race.”
