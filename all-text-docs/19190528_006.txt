DAVIDSON RK. O. ‘T. C. GOES
“OVER THE TOP" IN VIC-
TORY LOAN CAMPAIGN.

In the recent Victory Loan Campaign,
instituted by the Government in all R.
O. T. C.-units, Davidson came out sec-
ond in this district, with a total sub-
scription of over $89,650. Emory and
Henry, of Virginia, came out first, hav-
ing a subscription of $279,050. “This
district comprises several , states and
many colleges participated in this cam-
paign.

Most of this subscription was solicit-
ed by the students from people in the
surrounding community. Four of the
cadets were invited to take part in the
Charlotte campaign. ‘Ihey solicited $5,-
000 in Charlotte during this ‘campaign.

Due to the fact that Col, Mueller was
absent at the beginning of the campaign,
the unit was late in starting—otherwise
our figures. might be twice what they

R. B. Peters, Jr.

There was some doubt for a_ time
about the certainty of Lieut. Col. Muel-
ler being in charge of the R. O. T. C.
unit here next year. He had been antici-

pating very strongly a trip overseas to
relieve some of the officers that have
been on active service for some time.
However, we are very glad that his ap-

lication was refused——and he will be in
harge here next year.

He will go to Camp Lee about the
17th of June and will be there until the
fifth cf August. Any student desiring
any information regarding the R. ©.
T. C. here next year or any other mat-
ter concerning military training, Col.
Mueller will be very glad to receive let-
ters, and answer any question or give
any information desired.

His program for next year will be:
Drill for everybody three times a week—
with the exception of one day per
month, which will be taken, up with a
practice march. This march will take
the place of three drill periods or a
week's work. One or two hour periods
cach month will be given to short hikes.
These will ‘take the place of two drill
periods. There will be no - recitations
for Freshmen from September until Jan-
uary, But they will have three after-
noons of 45 minutes each in physical |
training. “There will be many games)
and other features that will make the
training as interesting as possible.

Complete equipment will be here by
the opening of the college and every
cadet will be issued a full outfit. ‘The
rifle range will be completed by Septem-
her and target practice will be conducted
at certain times. ‘lhe time spent on the
range at target practice will be credited
and taken off the regular drill periods.

A special plea is madé to all men of
any musical ability to bring their musi-
cal instruments with theny and to prac-
tice up during the summer. A sixteen-
piece band will be organized at the he-
ginning of the year, and all men with
any musical instrument suitable for band
are urged to try out.

With two Colonels like Col. Mueller
and Col, McConnell here next fall, the
|military feature cf Davidson College
should be a great success. Fellows, let's
vet. behind these men and do-our very
hest to make the Davidson unit of the
R. QO. ‘TP. C. the best in the south.

19's CLASS GIFT.

The Senior Class gift for the year
1919 consists of a set of light standards
placed upon the sides of the steps on the
west entrance of the Library. They
were made by a Charlotte firm and
erected last week. They do much to
improve the looks of the building. They
are clearly visible from the street and
light up the side of the building facing
the street. The gift was a particularly
fortunate selection. It was presented to
the college at the Class Day exercises
by Clewell Howell.

Tomorrow.

I shot an arrow into the air

It fell to earth I know not where,
Until the man on whom it fell

Came found and gave me—information.
