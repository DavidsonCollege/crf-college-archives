Cats, and the only one they will
play away from home.

Fogleman said he felt the
game could decide the team's
standing because they will have
the home field advantage in
their later games against Fur-
man and The Citadel.

The Appalachian game will
be played on Astroturf, and this
is the first time the team will
have played on an artificial sur-
face.

Fogleman pointed out the sur-
face may hurt the team's play
until they can adjust to the
changes.

The kickers presently stand
at 2-1 after slaughtering Pfeif-
fer at Davidson last Saturday
and dropping a contest to
Western Carolina Tuesday.

The 2-0 loss to Western
Carolina was _ particularly
disappointing because it point—
ed out the team's major
weaknesses in defense, ac-
cording to team member Tom
Tornee.

“The middle of the field was
wide open,” Fogleman said,
‘“‘and we couldn't control the
the game."

“Every year we have a bad
game, it seems,"’ he added. ‘'!
hope that this was it.”’

Both Tornee and Fogleman

‘Robison Plays 110 Percent’

By BILL LLOYD
Staff Writer

If you have seen a Davidson
soccer game within the past
four years then you have seen
Johnny Robison in action.

The 5-9, 175-pound senior in-
side can be seen almost
anywhere on the field from the
Davidson defensive lines to the
opponent's goal, hustling and
keeping the other Cat kickers
constantly on the move.

When Coach Harry Fogelman
is asked to talk about Robison.
his face seems to light up.

“Johnny is an extremely

Grid Club
Meets Duke

By FORD NEWMAN

The Davidson College Club
Football team plans to open

their season at Duke this
weekend.
“We have tentatively

scheduled a game this Saturday
afternoon with the Duke Club
Football team at Durham, Nor-
th Carolina,’ ' team member
Bob Wetzel said.

But according to Wetzel this
game may be postponed due to
problems with team organ-
ization and equipment short
. age.

The team has had only one
practice and the North Carolina
Club Football Association «( NC-
CFA) has not as yet come up
with the amount of equipment
needed for the 24 players.

Wetzel feels that the latter
problem will only be a tem-
porary problem. He said that
the equipment will probably be
obtained from the NCCFA in the
near future.

“If we don't: play against
Duke this weekend. our opening
game will be held in Charlotte
against Central Piedmont Com-
munity College the weekend ot
October 14." Wetzel added.

competative player who puts
out 110 percent on every play,”
stated Fogelman.

“Johnny has a fine
knowledge of the game and he's
really tough in the penalty area.
His only weakness seems to be
that he trys so hard, for so long
that he tends to reinjure his
already damaged knee. He just
doesn't know when to come
out,’ said Fogelman.

Fogelman also added that he
confers with Johnny concerning
various team problems.

Fogelman’s’ respect for
Robison is mirrored by his
teammates who elected him
co—captain unanimously.

When Robison himself was
asked about his abilities he sim-
ply said."*I don’t have the skills
of someone like Tornee. so I
have to make it up by hustling.”

This is the reason he spends
so much time on the ground or
flying through the air.

When asked about his
weaknesses he mentioned ‘trap-
ping. or getting the ball under
control after a pass.

However, teammate Bill
Hawk replied.“Johnny has no
weaknesses.

Robison did not mention that
because of the late start he and
the rest of the team are
relatively out of shape

When questioned about nis
feelings toward the student
body he said, “I was really hap-
py with the fan support at the
last soccer game

He also hopes that this will
stimulate interest in the spring
soccer club which is” the
training ground tor many
Davidson players.

Robison is disappointed
however, in the treatment of
minor sports by the ad-
ministration.

Using soccer as an example,
he felt that the budgets were too
small.

Such things as the limiting of
the soccer schedule from 14 to
12 games and the cancelling of
allovernight — trips were just a

few examples of the snubbing
by the administration.

Robison views the future of
the soccer team optimistically
with such upcoming freshmen
as Tom Blackwood and Steve

Tatum.

Fogelman summed up how he
feels about the contributions
Robison has made by
saying, ‘‘Id like to have 11 John-
ny Robisons on my team.”

positioning would be made later
this week.

‘We are going to make some
changes partially due to in-
juries and partially to utilize
our personnel _ better,”’
Fogleman said.

He said that lineman Johnny
Robison may be moved to half-
back and exchange student
Rheinhart Pfeil moved to left
inside, his usual position.

Fogleman pointed out that
other than the defensive
problems, the team played well
at Western Carolina.

He said the team did a good
job of shutting out an exchange
student from Hong Kong who
comprised much of Western
Carolina’s attack. .

He also complimented the
play of goalie Charlie Slagle,
saying he stopped two of
Western's ‘‘sure goals’’.

The team fared much better
in their 8-1 defeat of Pfeiffer
last Saturday.

Scoring in that game was
fairly evenly divided, with
Tornee hitting two, freshman
Tom Blackwood kicking two,
and Jack Linnard putting in
two.

Robert Stoubt and freshman
Bill Hawk each added one goal.

Fogleman said the team has
suffered from injuries after the
past two games, including
fullback Donnie Bain who in-
jured his leg in the Western
Carolina game.

After the Appalachian game,
the team will return to face
Atlantic Coast Conference rival
Duke next Tuesday.

Duke handed the Cats their
biggest loss last year 8—1.

In the B division, Frank Som-

Douglas predicted that Ten-
nessee, Clemson, and The
Citadel would do well in the
regatta.

“Davidson should be able to
do considerably better in this
regatta than we did in the past
two regattas, tor in this regatta
we have a ‘home advantage’;
we're familiar with both the
boats and the lake.” he added.

In discussing last week's
regatta at The Citadel, Douglas
Was quick to point out that
Davidson's last place finish was
not indicative of the team's im-
provement.

those encountered at Lake Nor-

‘You must realize that we're

competing with people that
have been sailing for several
years. Consequently, we'll just
have to practice harder and
longer,’ he said.

Skipper Dennis Keeley leans high into the wind during
sailing practice.
