The first team ends are now be-

junior reserve of last year, and Bob
Smith, a sophomere, are pushing
the two veterans, and will see plen-

At the tackles Knoeller,

playing on the team that will start
against State Saturday. Don Bell,
224 pound sophomore, and Cagle,
senior reserve from last year, will

Part of the freshman field bor-
dering on the golf course was cut
down, and graded on a slant to the
first fairway. The entire fairway
was leveled off and built up in cer-
tain spots. After the field was
leveled, a top soil was put on and
grass planted. The field is now
in tip-top condition for the coming
intramural athletics. se

Measuring around 650 feet long,
and about 160 feet wide, it fur-

used entirely for intramural ath-

for these games.

Some new changes been
effected in the intramural set-up.
Instead of having inter-class com-

tory competition, which is hoped to

brighten the interest in intramurals.
