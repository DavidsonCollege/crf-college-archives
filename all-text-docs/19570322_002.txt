Magazine Ready For Overhaul

Davidson College, in order to fulfill
more ably its role as a liberal arts
school, has various outlets for the artistic
in its midst. For this reason, it has long
supported and underwritten the expense
of a college magaine, which is obstensi-
bly designed to be a medium of expres-
sion for creative writers.

Along with its function as a creative
outlet goes its dual role as a humor maga-
zine. To these twin goals has been tied
the fortune of “Scripts 'n Pranks” for
the last eleven years.

In 1923 a more serious literary work
was disbanded after an unusually contro-
versial article. “The Yowl”’, primarily ded-
icated to humor, followed until it too,
disintegrated. The “Scripts ’n Pranks’ be-
gan in November of 1936 as a combina-
tion of the best qualities of the above
mentioned efforts. Among its first con-
tributers was C. A. (Pete) McKnight, now
editor of the Charlotte Observer.

Within the memory of this student
generation there have been few, if any,
memorable editions of ‘Scripts 'n
Pranks.” On a whole the writing has been
rather ordinary, often obviously designed
to fill up the assigned three or four pages.

The humor angles have degenerated
to a sort of “locker room” level, not too
dirty, but shady enough. Through it all
in the years past has been a kind of
pseudo-sophisticated, polished, urbanity
that neither calls for an emotional re-
sponse nor could be termed provocative.

In short, it has left most of the students
“cold.”

Because it is our money that prints
the magazine, except for the ad money
garnered through the Davidson name, it
is certainly within the rights of the stu-
dent to question the contribution of the
magazine.

This is in no way a direct criticism
of the editors of this year’s or any other
year’s “Scripts ’n Pranks.” It is rather
an investigation of the system which we
allow to be used.

Serious thought ought to be given to
revamping the whole endeavor. Would it
not produce a much more enjoyable and
certainly a higher quality magazine if,
for one alternative, two issues were pub-
lished yearly instead of the four now
called for?

The prize winning short stories and
poems often are excellent. Both Chuck
Wright and Jim Kuist have demonstra-
ted their ability to write with imagination
and creativity. Calling from the best of
their work in the two issues, along with
the contributions of those in the con-
tests, could certainly give a much more
valuable literary work.

At any rate, a good number of the
students feel that the money invested
in “Scripts ’n Pranks” has been wasted.
It is time that its position be re-evaluated
and perhaps a constructive transition in-
crease. its value to the reading public.

Pressure And Big-Time Athletics

There still persists in some rather
prominent quarters the feeling that Da-
vidson athletics have become too de-em-
phasized, and that increased subsidiza-
tion would be a good thing both for the
College and the athletic program.

With this point of view we violently
disagree.

While definitely a minority, this big-
time athletic group is a highly vociferous
element, and by virtue of this has seemed
at times to have the potential to sway
dangerously enough middle-of-the-roaders
to push their schemes through.

Not too many months ago, a mem-
ber of the Board of Trustees made it
known that he was keeping a “‘little black
book” on any member of the faculty who
openly refused to string along with in-
creased subsidization. While such a
despicable attitude is certainly an ex-
treme, it is unnerving to know that even
one man in such a responsible position
would go so far as to virtually threaten
the jobs of those who oppose him.

Over the years have come occasional
attempts to make sure that athlete-appli-
cants were admitted whether they met
the admissions standards of the Col-
lege or not. Such people invariably point

to the splendid academic and extra-cur-
ricular records of Davidson’s subsidized
athletes. This is an. unusually well-justi-
fied generalization, but nonetheless it is
still a generalization.

For some specifics, let’s look at the
present freshman class.

Six: freshmen withdrew from school
voluntarily during the first semester,

once classes got underway. Of these six, -

five were here on athletic grants. One
of these dropped his scholarship after ar-
riving on campus, and did not participate
in varsity athletics. The remaining four
had averages of .00, .00, .00, and .08.

Admittedly, this record is far from be-
ing typical of the men who have received
athletic scholarships in the past, and

some will shrug it off as simply a bad.

year. But it should serve to point up
the fact that Davidson cannot and should
not make any differentiation in its admis-
sion policy towards athletes and non-
athletes.

Davidson’s athletic program is strong,
and is extremely beneficial as it now
stands. It would be a tragedy to allow
those who would impose big-time opera-
tions and pressure to wreck it.

Spencer's Shoes Hard To Fill

Dr. Samuel R. Spencer’s long-rumored

appointment Thursday as the President:

of Mary Baldwin College in Staunton,
Virginia leaves another gaping hole in
the Administration of the College.

Since his elevation to the deanship in
the spring of 1954, Dr. Spencer has done
more than any other one man toward im-
proving the relationship and attitudes be-
tween the Student Body, and the Faculty
and Administration, so often at belliger-
ently opposite poles in the past.

Armed with a decidedly progressive
approach to student problems, Dr. Spen-
cer has taken the lead in giving student
maturity the acid test of added responsi-
bility. Overall, the confidence he has
placed in the Student Body has been
gratifyingly justified. The success en-
joyed by his sweeping reforms of the cut

system provide an superb example.

We are extremely reluctant to see Dr.
Spencer go. He has brought honor to him-
self and to the College, first as a student,
and Jater as a teacher, author, historian,
and administrator. We will especially
miss his insight and leadership at a time
in the history of the College when mo-
mentous changes are in the making.

Mary Baldwin is exceedingly fortu-
nate to obtain the vision and ability of
such a man to spearhead her plans for
expansion and improvement. We join
with Davidsonians everywhere in wish-
ing him and his family the greatest
measure of success and satisfaction in
their new work.

His slot in our scheme of things will
be a hard one to fill.

Humor Magazine Candidates State Policy Views

Grier Davis

It was just a few days ago. I
had been clipping my toenails and
banking them
neatly off the
wall into the
trash can. Then
Jim had come
in and = asked
me if I wanted
to run for edi-
tor of the
Scripts and
Pranks. After
I had told him
that I would
very much, I lay down on my bed
to think about it.

Davis

It wasn’t until the janitor came
in that I became perplexed. As he
swept up the stray toenails, I
told him about my nomunation.
He had told me earlier that he
was satisfied by the explanation
of the College Girl (although it
seems that no one else was), but
now he posed a new question.
“Just what is the purpose of the
magazine anyway?”

College Humor

It seems to me that this year’s
magazine has progressed well be-
yond those of latter years in its
primary purpose. The editors have
offered a magazine designed for
college humor.

IT would propose to publish two
parodies, an humor issue satiriz-
ing either one of the current
“sophisticated” magazines or else
one of the periodicals, such as
Reader’s Digest and Post, and a
literary issue based on the style
of the New Yorker.

The Homecoming and Davidson

Gentleman issues would serve an-
other purpose. Humor might be
described as the realization of the
incongruities of human nature,
and there is a need for an ex-
pression of the obvious incongrui-
ties on our own campus.

This year’s Davidson Gentleman
issue’ was designed as a “student
themometer . . . to register
the attitude, the mood, the aspira-
tions of student life.” It did do
this to a large extent, but, per-
haps, the very “attitude” ex-
pressed might be subject to some
penetrating questions.

Satire

It would be the underlying idea
of these two issues to satirize and
criticize our own college society, its
values and its manifestations.

Although there is traditionally
only one literary issue of the
Scripts and Pranks, the magazine
must retain good literary quality
‘in every issue, and it should have
the function of serving as a train-
ing ground for younger writers.

Counseling Group

With the help of the English
professors, I propose to investt-
gate such literary talent at the
beginning of the year and to set
up a counseling group which

would criticize and aid the work
of those who wish to improve
their style and mode of expres-
sion.

In this way, not only will the
magazine be assured of a large

number of mature writers each
year but also it will be serving a
function which is not otherwise
employed on the campus, acting
as a medium of literary expres-
sion and interpretation.

Tom Kernan

I take pen in cloven hoof to ad-
dress a few thoughts, secreted
from my gnome-
like brain in the
howling dead

of night, to
you, the noble
vote-wielders in
the forth-com-
ing election.

A magazine
is only as good
as its writers;
this is an ob-

vious fact. The task of an editor
is to care for each individual crea-
tive plant which falls under his
eagle eye, to draw forth the bud-
ding author into full bloom and
reap the harvest of his fertile
mind.

A good editor must also ve able
to distinguish between the fertile
mind and the sterile one; he must
not serve the public crab apples
when it expects grapefruit. (Crab
apple lovers may reverse this last
analogy.)

Editorial Eye

The real issue is the editorial
eye which I just mentioned; it
needs a pair of glasses.- College
magazines seem to breed a closely-
knit, dedicated little band of writ-
ers who are the sole contributors
to the magazine's contents. This
is not odd since the best writers
tend to gravitate towards the cam-
pus literary water hole, the liter-
ary society or fraternity, to share
their talents with one another.

I believe that if I don these eye-
opening spectacles, I may discover
several literary-minded hermits,
chipping out epic poems on the
walls of their lonely caves, and
draw them out to serve the com-

IN LIGHT OF PROPOSED COURT

Now Is The Time To Analyze All
Aspects Of Fraternity System

By BOB JONES

“It is a law of nature that any-
thing that does not serve its pur-
pose disap-
pears. College
fraternities will
disappear un-
less they fulfill
their high re-
sponsibilit ies.”
(From Dr.
Ralph W. Sock-
man’s Novem-
ber address to
the National In-
terfraternity

Sones’

Conference.)

In this brief review of problems
in our fraternity system, let it
be pointed out that no attempt
to present solutions or biases is
intended; these should be offered
only after investigation by the
committee proposed last week.
The purpose here is to raise prac-
theal questions about our system
and see if student opinion war-
rants an evaluation.

RUSH WEEK

Rush Week. There arises legiti-
mate doubt as to whether the first
week of an individual’s college
life is the best time to confront
him with the decision made dur-
ing rush week. Considering all the
factors, is the current plan aiding
or abetting the adjustment a
freshman must make? Can a fra-
ternity really know the fellows
they want, and can the freshman
know the fraternity well enough
to be sure it is the one he wants
to join? Or do the advantages of
the present arrangement outweigh
such considerations?

FRATERNITY SIZE

Fraternity size. Davidson fra-
ternities range from 30 to 80 in
membership. Is such a wide range
justified under the ideal of the
fraternity system or is a quota
system better? In a large fraterni-
ty the natural tendency is to
break down into smaller groups
which often lead to rivalry instead

of fraternity. Can the aim of fra-
ternity life be realized under such
conditions?
DRINKING
Drinking. The position on drink-
ing taken by the administration
and student constitution raises
fundamental questions concern-
ing a “realistic” social pattern. Is
the present policy consistent with
what is expected from the frater-
nities, or is forcing fraternities off
the campus for functions, parties,
etc., assuming the attitude (and
position) of an ostrich?

It is realized that such brief
handling of this subject cannot
hope to be comprehensive. The
only thesis maintained here is that
with the coming construction of
a new fraternity court, it is an
opportune time for more exten-
sive analysis of all aspects of the
system. This is an area in which
initlative by the new student gov-
ernment could make it a real in-
strument for improving Davidson
College.

mon weal and welfare.

If you're still there, let’s exam-
ine my ideas for the niagazine
proper. Its policy should be to
lay bare the Davidson soul and
to offer enjoyment and wisdom
in the inspection of its pink tis-
sues. But lest we become sub-
merged in our own tears, we must
have more humor, a hearty if
somewhat wheezing chuckle over
the inevitable shafts which ‘pro-
fessors and girl friends leave in
our quivering abdomens.

Axe Grinding

1 will not forget those among
you who wish to do a bit of axe
grinding and scalping. I favor this
sort of mental disembowelment
in the form of satire and not the
clumsy, clod-hoppered essay. Yet
there must be freedom of. expres-
sion; the campus artist must not
be made to grind out a story or
poem to fit a neat editorial policy.
He must be left free to mate with
the Muse and spawn his own
brood. I, as editor, would merely
act as the marriage broker. So,
Arise! fellow thumbsucking
Southerners; support this rather
shakey platform;. we'll fall to-
gether,

Billy Long

In recent years, each issue of
Scripts and Pranks seems to have
travelled basic-
ally the same
path. This route
has in many
ways been ex:
cellent. In
others, it -has
fallen short.

The maga-
zine is pub-
lished with a
dual _—s purpose,
to represent
Davidson’s literary talent and to
provide entertainment for the en-
tire student body. How well has
it accomplished this?

More Contributions

At times, Scripts and Pranks
has tended to be somewhat ex-
clusive. The list of contributors
has been small—very small when

Few college journalists have
the opportunity to write farewell
columns to their readers, (if any)
twice during one college career.
Oceasionally, however, a has-been
is resurrected and warmed over.
Our byline first appeared in the
October 22, 1948 issue of the Da-
vidsonian; we now discover that
old soldiers aren't the only peo-
ple who just fade away.

In looking back over the
past nine year, we see a pic-
ture of Davidson that is a con-
fused conglomeration of the
college as it was, as it is,
and as it is related to the out-
side world. (There is one out
there, you knowl)

With reference to the first two
of these, it suffices to say that
many things have changed: the
campus, the cut system, compul-
sory chapel, and the faces—espe-
cially the faces. Other things re-
main, and will continue to remain,
as long as college students are
college students, and Davidson is
Davidson.

Ideally, o@ “Church-related
liberal arts college’ should
perform at least two major
functions: provide windows to
the outside world for its stu-
dents, end create an stmos-
phere of intangible values to
serve as criteria for behaviour
in leter life. No college is
perfect in this respect, and
Davidson is no exception.
Worse, it doesn’t perform
these functions nearly as well
es most of us would like to
believe.

The first of these unfortunate
deficiencies is Davidson’s lack of
contact with patterns of life which
do not conform to the way we
believe life should be; only in a
limited sense do the cloister and
culture interact. ;

This failure in respect to
the “windows” is not so much
that they do not exist; they’re
just dusty from disuse. Stu-
dents, for the most part, are
too lazy, intellectually, to

to.

compared to the large amount of
untapped talent available. This, I
feel, is a mistake. The magazine
could serve its greatest benefit
by acting as a stimulus to the
dormant literary lights of the stu-
dent body.

Therefore, it would be my pur-
pose to seek out and encourage
creative writing through the pages
of this publication, thus affording
a broader and more interesting
view of Davidson's literary poten-
tial. I do not advocate a lowering
of the high standards already set
for us. Rather, I would like to add
to these standards by offering a
greater variety of high caliber
writing. No sacrifice in quality is
necessary—the talent is here.

Emphasis on Humor

Humor in past issues has usual-
ly been excellent, but far too
searce. Greater emphasis should
be placed upon the various medi-
ums of mirth. Entailed in this
trend would be a more frequent
usage of pictorial essays, cartoon
plates, and jokes on subjects clos-
er to home—devices designed to
lampoon the things at Davidson
which best deserve lampooning.

One issue should be dedicated
to parody — “Slime”, “Strife”,
“Poorboy”, or “Esquirt”. An un-

dertaking of this type would be
both enjoyable and profitable, but
it would require the work and co-
operation of a large group if suc-
cess were to be assured.

Untapped Potential

Scripts and Pranks can be im-
proved. It has a potential which
has not beén reached. To meet
this potential, there should be
more frequent and more relevant
humor. There should be a greater
representation of quality style and
thought.

Scripts and Pranks is a maga-
zine designed to benefit and enter-
tain the student body. It would be
my purpose, through the propos-
als outlined above, to present a
magazine of the quality and type
which Davidson College demands.

FROM THE TOP

open them, end some of the

scenery, such as the slum

sreas and Negro housing less
than 500 yards from the cam-
pus, is exceedingly unpleas-

ont. ,

The other deficiency we have
mentioned—the atmosphere of in-
tangible values—is stifling, most-
ly because of the hypocricy which
permeates it. The middle-class
business man sheds his office
coat and puts on charcoal gray
for Sunday morning; his son who
attends Davidson, finds this im-
possible.

dunior has no choice but
to bring his everyday values
into direct interaction with

Davidson’s Sundsy morning

values. The result is confilet,

and eventually, mutual disre-
gerd.

To make matters worse, cer-
tain Pharisees survey the situation
and say: “Thank God, I’m not like
Junior.” He, in turn, is con-
demmed by that epitome of self-
righteousness who says, “Thank
God, I'm not like that Pharisee.”
(Who, me?) f

Such a situation cennot be
remedied in a day, and its
solution can only begin with
the individual. Eech of us
must undertake eo healthy in-
trospection; @ reevalustion of
the whys and wherefores of
our existence, as humen be-
ings, as Christians (if we ere),
and as Davidson Students,

Only after this has been com-
pleted can we take the next step:
a critical examination, as mem-
bers of the college community,
of the differences between what
Davidson really is and what It
claims to be.

Then we must choose, from al-
ternative courses of action, those
which seem to be the most ef.
fective ways of bringing the real
into a closer harmony with the
ideal. Finally—and this is where
we usually falter—we must unite
in an enthusiastic effort to under-
take the actions we have chosen.
