GETTING A KICK OUT OF SPRING

(Staff Photos by Lyle)

Spirit, Multiple Offense
Breed Optimism In Drills

“With each practice you
can see something new fall-
ing into place. I can't help
getting excited.”

Quarterback Mark Thomp-
son reflected the enthusiasm
of this year’s football team
as he commented on the ex-
cellent progress the squad
has made in spring drills.

There are problems.
There are new people learn-
ing a new offense under a
new coaching staff with the
new pressure as the defend-
ing conference champions
for the first time in David-

son history. The players see
the coming season as one
with every possibility of be-
ing a very successful one.

Thompson ‘believes that
the 1970 Wildcats will pro-
duce a more total team ef-
fort than last year’s team.
“There is a lack of a super-
star, which may change be-
fore. the season is over.
Last’ year before the sea-
son started we realized that
there were some outstand-
ing players. In a tight situa-
tion you knew that these
guys would produce. Next
season we won't have any-

body like that to turn to.

“Everyone. must suck it
up and realize that they
must do their part. I'm opti-
mistic about next year. Be
ing the quarterback I'll be
expected to produce.”

Offensive guard Frank
Rader added,: ‘'The morale
has been very. high. This is
due to Coach Fagg. He
knows us and our pro
blems.”

“The team is working
harder than ever before,
more conditioning and more
hitting,"’ said Jim Hovis.
Hovis, a running back last
year, will be the freshman
defensive back coach.

The key topic of the spring
drills has been the institu-
tion of the new multiple of-
fense, the wishbone. It was
designed ‘to fit this year's
personnel and it seems to
be working very well in
practice so far.

“T enjoy it much ‘more
than anything I've ever run
in the past,’’ Thompson
said. “I love to throw. but
to rely entirely on our
passing game would be
ridiculous. We won't have
the passing threat, but it
would. he sttptd not to gut
it out with power runners
like Mike  Mikolayunas,
Johnny Ribet and David
Mockbee.

‘Alle these ‘guys lower
heads and knock through
the line. If these guys are
consistent we will be just as
well off as if we relied on
the pass.”

Rader also sees the run
ning game as more effective
this fall. ‘We should have
an hellacious running game.
We have the “material to
move the ball effectively.”

Hovis also believes that
the team is picking up the
new offensive well. ‘“‘It’s

Cantrell Credits Coaching, Attitude
For Perfect Personal Season Mark

By A. W. TURNER
Asst. Sports Editor
Winning is nothing strange
to this year’s Southern Con-
ference number five tennis
champion. Jim Cantrell
has played on David-
son's tennis team for three
years, and his comulative
singles record for that time
is 503. The junior netter
has never lost to a confer-

ence foe.

Cantrell, who hails from
H. B. Plant High School in
Tampa, Florida, has play-
ed number five throughout
most of his three year col-
lege career. This year he
won 22 consecutive matches
in an undefeated season.

Asked why an underfeat-
ed player would be number
five, Cantrell said, “This
year's team was very
balanced. Instead of having
one real good player, one
not quite as good as the
number one player, and so
on down through the six
places, we had a team on
which almost anyone could
have played three or four,

no one really good enough to

play number one, and any-
body good enough to play
through number five  op-
ponents undefeated.”

Cantrell was all praise
for tennis coach Harry
Fogleman. ‘Coach Fogle-
man is a great ‘help in help-
ing us plan tactics, He helps.
you get.the most of what
you've got. I know he has
made me a much smarter
player.

“Coach Fogleman also
puts a great deal of stress
on temperment and court
attitude. You have to be
able to accept the fact that
you aren’t the best tennis
player in the world, and
that you’re going to miss
some shots. It really gets
funny sometimes if I’m
playing someone who can’t
hold his temper. But as far
as I’m concerned, the more
he yells and throws his
rackte the better, because
the madder he gets the
worse he plays. :

“Something also a_ tennis
player has to remember is
to never let up. Sometimes
if you're winning too easily

‘enough confidence

you tend not to try as hard.
But if you let up, you may
lose three or four points
right in a row. What it
amounts to is that you have
to try to beat your opponent
as badly as you can and
get the match over with.

‘Coach Fogleman leaves
the tranling mdiniy up to
each individual. He has
in each
of us to know .that we're
going to keep in shape and
not stay out too late the
night before a match.”

It would’ seem that a net-

‘ter with a record such as

his -would like to be playing

for some big university with
a subsidized program, but
Cantrell disagrees. ‘‘I pick-
ed Davidson because I
wanted to come to a school
where I-could get a good
education and play tennis.

“I like the situation as it
is here. It gives me the
chance to piay against guys
in my competition range.
Since the program is not
subsidized, I am under no
pressure to be out on the
court practicing three or
four hours every day. Aca-
demics come first. Coach
Fogleman feels very much
this way.”

his duties, believes that the
current program is largely
successful in its present
form.

At the same time Ster

ling Martin, an instructor in
the program who is current
ly doing most of the ad
ministrative ‘details of the
program such as class roles
and grades, did not con-
demn the present program
but warned that it seems to
be drifting without a defin-
ite purpose at the moment.

“| think that the program
hit a low point a few years
ago and right now we are
on the rise,’’ Martin said.
“We are at a point now
where we must make some
decisions as to how the pro-
gram is to be structured
and run,”

The question of the form
of the physical education is
perhaps the key one which
remains to be resolved.
There is no consensus among
the administrators of the
program as to just what
they hope to provide in the
class periods.

Outlaw came out in favor
of the idea of physical de-
velopment as the chief
function of the program. ‘‘It
is my own personal belief
that the physical edu -
cation program should
place its primary em -
phasis on instruction and
physical development. — In-
tramurals have been estab
lished as the recreational
portion of the program.”
