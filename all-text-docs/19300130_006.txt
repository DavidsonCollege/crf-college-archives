THE DAVIDSONIAN, JANUARY 30, 1930

Wildkitten Quint Noses
Out Steele Creek Five
In Close Battle, 26-22

“Skinny” Pierce Stars for Freshmen
ile Hoover Brothers Are
Visitors’ Luminaries

Last Monday night the Davidson Wild-
kittens defeated the Steele Creek Quintet
by the score of 26 to 22 in a fast game.
The star of the game was L. S. “Skinny”
Pierce, the brilliant center of the ‘Wild-
kittens, “Skinny” shot 14 of Davidson’s 26
points and was also very speedy with his
floor work. Starring with “Skinny” was
Bruce Peabody, the alert guard of the
Freshmen. Although he only. scored three
points, he was nevertheless a constant
menace to the Steele Creek forwards.
Time after time he intercepted Steele
Creek’s passes near their goal.

The chief scorers for Steele Creek were
the Hoover brothers, who scored seven
points each, They also starred on the de-
fense against the Wildkittens’ passes.
Steele Creek showed the fans that they
had a brilliant team, and that they could
work together for points,

The lineups of the two teams are as
follows :

IMPORTANT CHANGES

allowed to return to Oxford for the third
year after some years of work in their own
country, or may be allowed to spend their
third year in further graduate work in any
university of Great Britain or on. the con-
tinent of Europe on conditions approved by
the Rhodes trustees.

There is now a tendency to appoint young-
er men, so that they may enter Oxford
immediately following their. American uni-
versity of college career. In fact, the North
Carolina appointee who.was ¢lected in De-
cember, 1929, will have completed only three
years at Duke University.

A further somewhat radical change of
policy ‘has already gone into effect. Students
of the United States Naval and Military
Academies are now eligible to appointment.
This year the surprising result is that one-
fourth of the awards went to representatives
of these institutions, six to Annapolis and
two to West Point, a total of eight out of
thirty-two.

The following is a summary of the insti-
tutions from which the last appointments
were made:

United States Military Academy (ap-
pointees from Louisiana and Nebraska), two.

United States Naval Academy (Arizona,
Arkansas, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Dakota
and Wisconsin), six.

State Universities of Alabama, Colorado,
Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota,
Mississippi, Montana, South Carolina, Texas,
Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming, one
each, fourteen. ;

State Colleges of New Mexico and Wash-
ington, one each, two.

Other _ institutions: Bethany (Kansas),
Duke (North Carolina), Emory (Georgia),
Jamestown (North Dakota), Reed (Ore-
gon), Stanford (California), Swarthmore
(Pennsylvania) .and Washington( St. Louis,
Mo.), one each, eight.

Total 1929 awards, thirty-two.

_ Although during the last two or three
years no Davidson men have been appointed,
we have fared very well during the twenty-
five years of the operation of the scholar-
ships, in prepention to our enrollment. We:
have had two from North Carolina, two from
South Carolina and one from Arkansas.
Students who aspire to the scholarships
should make a study of the scholarships
early in their college career. The stipend is
400 pounds, or nearly $2000 a year. Thus
the Rhodes Scholarship is the largest aca-
demic prize open to undergraduates. There
are, of course, other awards open to graduate
students, but these are of a somewhat difer-
ent nature.

There are still a number of Jun-
iors and Seniors who have not
turned in their honors to Quips and
Cranks. The editorial staff of the
annual requests that this omission
be rectified as soon as possible.
Special attention is called to the
following points: Name (full name);
College Degree; Address; Activi-
ties and Honors.

It is necessary that this matter
be handled quickly and carefully, in

Town Team Is Host

Miss Elkins is Presented Medal by
Freshman Rifle Team

One of the provisions of the recent rifle
match between the Freshmen and _ the
local Girls’ Team was that the losers
should entertain the winners at a dinner.
The Freshmen were victorious in the
match and last Saturday evening at the
home of Captain Elkins the Freshmen
team was the guest of the local team.

A five-course dinner was served to the
winners while the losers also received five
courses, each course consisting of peas,
cornbread and water.

A beautiful medal was presented by the
Rifle Team to Miss Nona Elkins of the
Girls’ Team. This medal was for the
highest score recorded by any member
of the girls’ team in the match. Miss El-
kins scored 263 points out of a possible
300 and was third in the entire scoring of
the match,

Those attending this affair were Cap-
tain and Mrs. Elkins, Misses Nona Elkins,
Billie Elkins, Sarah Jetton, Agnes Brown,
Heistand Scott and Malline Lyon, Mem-
bers of the Girls’ Team. The members of
the Freshman Team, Arlington, Flinn,
Poole, Burgess, Rachel and Brown. Oth-
ef guests were Miss Helen DeVane and
C. P. Greyer.

DIRIGIBLE PASSES OVER

over Davidson on its turn to the north.
The ship was making slow time as it
reached Davidson, but soon increased its
speed and rapidly vanished from sight.

The big ship’s appearance was a re-
minder of the ill-fated “Shenandoah’s”
flight over Davidson several years ago.

HIGHER EDUCATION

At North Carolina State College of Ag-
riculture and Engineering, Professor Wil-
liam Hand Browne examined his class in
electrical engineering. Chagrined and
grieved was he to discover, when he had
graded all the papers, that the average
mark of the class was 121-2 per cent.

When Professor Browne’s students
went to his classroom last week, they
were surprised to find his door closed.
Fixed upon it was this sign: “The papers
from the class are the poorest I ever got
in 20 years of teaching. . . . It would be
wise not to bother me for the rest of the

and prayer.

“SERVICE” WAS THEME

““ (Continued from page 1)
struction one day, and asked a stone mason
working there what he was doing. The reply
was, ‘cutting stone.’ He then asked another
stone cutter what he was doing, and the
reply: ‘making eight dollars a day.’ He
proceeded a little further and repeated his
inquiry to a third man doing the same job.
He answered, ‘building a cathedral.’ There
is not much doubt as to which of these men
was of the most service on this particular
construction, He had the vision.

The second necessary characteristic is
virtue. Virtue is being a man and he who
would have it, we learn from the ancient
philosophers, must do all that and only that
which will make him more of a man. The
great athletes tells us that clean living is
one of their essential rules. We cannot hope
to be virtuous or wise without clean living
and clean thinking.

The third necessary characteristic we must
remember if we would be successful in our
service is our Vow to God. If we are in part-
nership with Jesus Christ we cannot fail for
we have a partner that always wins. As we
go into the new semester let’s remember the
two men looking from behind bars—one saw
mud, the other stars. Also we will do those
things which will make us men and leave the
others out, and finally we will stick close
to our partner Jesus Christ.

BASKETBALL SQUAD

(Continued from page 1)
Johnston is continuing to display mid-
season form, and Goodson and Proctor
are playing the guard positions in such a
manner that opponents are having a
tough time getting by them. Rusk and
Milton are alternating at center, with
neither having a very decided advantage
over the other. Rusk has started most of
the games, but Milton has always seen his
share of service.

The men who will make the trip have
not been announced yet, but in all prob-

‘ability Coach Younger will take the same

men who have been making the other
journeys. The substitutes will likely see
plenty of service during every game, as
it will be necessary to save the regulars
as much as possible.

by midnight, March 15, and the targets must
be mailed by March 19,

Records made by Davidson entries in the
past have been exceptionally good and have
served to arouse great interest in the pos-
sibilities for better teams. Several compe-
tent marksmen are among Davidson’s con-
testants already, while more are expected to
develop as the year goes on and as interest
continues to grow.

It’s a long jane that has no curves.
