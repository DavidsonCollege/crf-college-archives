PAC releases Evaluation Code draft

By EMILY PARTIN
Staff Writer

In the words of Vice-President for
Academic Affairs Price Zimmermann,
“the great moment has arrived.”

A proposed draft of a set of codified
faculty evaluation procedures, drawn
up by Zimmermann, was released to
The Davidsonian and distributed to all
faculty members Wednesday.

This proposed draft represents an
exchange of ideas between college
President Samuel R. Spencer, Zimmer-
mann, and the Professional Affairs
Committee (PAC). This draft is by no
means final, but will be subject to
changes proposed by faculty members,
said Professor of Physics Robert J.
Manning, a member of the PAC.

The faculty will hold an open

meeting sometime in the future to
discuss the proposed code, according to
PAC Chairman | Allan ~ Wolf,
Professor of Physics.

The proposed draft sets up six
criteria which will be used to evaluate
faculty members.

The first criterion is ‘mastery of the
field taught.’’ Among factors to be
considered here are publication ‘‘with
quality being more important than
quantity,” participation in professional
societies, and contribution to the
college’s intellectual atmosphere.

The second criterion is ‘‘excellence in
curriculum design.”’ This is basically
an evaluation of the organization and
content of the professor’s courses.

The thrid criterion is ‘‘skill in
communicating knowledge and in moti-

vating students to learn.”

The fourth criterion is ‘‘personal
concern for students.”’ This evaluation
will include such things as teacher
commitment, availability to students,
and ability to act as an advisor.
Faculty members will, in their dealings
with students, be encouraged to ‘“‘help
them on an individual basis to realize
their full human potential.”’

The fifth criterion is ‘‘the capacity to
exemplify by personal witness the
intellectual and moral values for which
the college stands.”

The proposed draft reaffirms the
Christian committment of the college
and the Statement of Purpose.

The preamble of the document
begins by recognizing that ‘‘the goal of
Davidson’s appointment and: evalua-

tion procedures is to recruit, appoint,
and retain for the faculty outstanding
men and women who will carry on the
college’s mission as set down in the
Statement of Purpose. In essence this
is to develop persons of humane
instincts, of disciplined and creative
minds, and of Christian character.

The document states that ‘‘More-
over, a church-related college which is
faithful to its heritage has the obliga-
tion of securing for its faculty teachers
and scholars who, above and beyond
their professional committments, up-
hold the highest ethical ideals, whose
motive is service, and whose approach
to teaching is, in most instances,
informed by their commitment as
Christians.”

New medical facility

Duncan placed on probation

By DONALD CALDWELL
Staff Writer

After’ accepting a plea of
guilty, a: six person hearing
committee imposed the punish-
ment of probation on Davidso-
nian Editor Philip Duncan late
Tuesday night.

Duncan was accused by Alan
Wolf, Professor of Physics and
Chairman of the Faculty Pro-
fessional Affairs Committee
(PAC), of “interference of his
right to maintain private pos-
session over the contents of his
faculty mailbox.”

The case was prosecuted un-
der the Code of Responsibility.

College launches health plan

By CHARLES ERWIN
Staff Writer

As part of a new long-range
college health plan spearheaded
by the Dean of Students Office,
construction workers yesterday
used a yellow bulldozer to
scrape out the foundation of a
proposed college-owned medical
building.

The building, which will be
located behind the Center for
Special Studies, was designed
by Physical Plant Director
Grover Meetze in close coopera-
tion with the two doctors who
will work at the Student Infir-
mary next year.

Scheduled for completion be-
fore the opening of school next

fall, the entire project is on a —

tight fast-paced schedule.

‘‘We’re in a hurry. We've
worked on tight schedules be-
fore--no problems. We're going
to try to do it within six or eight
months if we can,” said Meetze.

Although the Board of Trus-
tees has been tossing around
the idea of constructing a
medical building since the fall,
the final decision to go ahead
with the project was only made
recently.

“It became a reality a very
short time ago--a month, maybe

six weeks ago. I met with the
doctors to see what they
needed,” said Meetze.

Meetze stressed that even
though he took a fairly short
while to design the building this
has had no detrimental effects
on the quality of his work. “I’ve
been influenced by the Carolina
Inn in the design of it,’ he said.

The building is small, contai-
ning only about 2500 square
feet. ‘‘It’ll be less than a
hundred thousand dollars,” as-
sured Meetze.

When completed, according
to Dean of Students Will Terry,
the building will be leased to the
doctors for’their private prac-
tice. The infirmary will continue
to be used for student concerns.

The two doctors said they
planned to submit a questio-
naire to the student body in a
few weeks to find out the most
popular hours for infirmary sick
call.
One of the two, Dr. Bill
Williams, indicated that they
will also ask students to make
constructive suggestions for
improvement and to critically
evaluate the present job being
done at the infirmary. |

Williams is one of the seven
doctors from the Charlotte Me-

morial Hospital who have
worked at the infirmary this
year. He lives in Davidson.

The other physician, Dr. Ron
Hunt, is presently working in
an army hospital and won’t
arrive in town until about the
first of July, according to
Terry.

Both men are Davidson gra-
duates.

“One of the fine things about
this new arrangement is that we
are bringing two men who know
and love Davidson. They will
bring to the community and
college a care and concern. We
are lucky to have men so
professionally competent and
personally fine,”’ said Terry.

Oddly enough, while both
doctors were at Davidson their
academic extra-curricular lives
bore striking similarities, ac-
cording to Terry.

Among other things, they
were both hall counselors,
hearing committee chairmen,
and members of Phi Beta
Kappa.

“It’s amazing that they fol-
lowed the same track almost
exactly,’’ said Terry. ‘‘Both of
them are very service-minded
people or they wouldn't have
come to a small country town.”

The 1971 Code of Disciplinary
Procedures defines probation as
“Exclusion from participation
in privileged or extracurricular
college activities for a period
not exceeding one year.’’

The penalty will extend over
the remainder of Spring Term,
requiring him to leave The
Davidsonian until the end of the
academic year. Until a meeting
of the Media Committee Thurs-
day morning considers the edi-
torial vacancy, Pamela Camerra
will remain acting editor.

Vice-President for Academic
Affairs Price Zimmermann
completed the final draft of the
Code of Faculty Evaluation on
March 29. Copies of the Code
were placed in the boxes of PAC
members that morning, with
Duncan allegedly removing,
photocopying, and returning
Wolf's copy that afternoon.

Originally, on March 30,
Wolf levied the charge under
the jurisdiction of the Honor
Code. However, he says he
questioned whether the case
merited the impact of an Honor
violation charge.

‘‘That problem always bo-
thered me. I talked to Will
Terry, the members of the PAC,
and Hans Watford (the Student
Solicitor) about it, relaying the
decision to change it to a Code
of Responsibility charge on
Friday. I do believe he took

s6mething that did not belong
to him and after talking to Hans
and several others they con-
vinced me that it was not a clear
cut case for an Honor violation.
I wish the decision between the
two codes had not been mine.”

The three hour proceeding
was Chaired by junior Jamie
Watt. The other members were
juniors Paul. Bradley and
Charles Cochran, sophomores
Robert McEwen, Betsy
Thomas, and Joseph Summer-
all, and freshman. Greg
Burnard.

Tuesday’s committee hearing
convened with a reading of the
formal charge by Student Pro-
secutor and Solicitor Hans
Watford. Duncan then entered
a plea of guilty with extenua-
ting circumstances, continuing
with a description of his actions
in relation with the case.

He noted that in several
different interviews with Zim-
mermann and college President

- Samuel Spencer, he received the

impression that a copy of the
code would be released to The
Davidsonian.

“Spencer and Zimmermann
seemed to offer no objections
that The Davidsonian have a
copy of the Code, but both were
concerned that it go through
proper channels (ie, through the
PAC), that it not be sent over
