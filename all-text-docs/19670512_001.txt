Students Support pusic wit flow
Concord Road Site

According to the poll taken in
chape! Tuesday, students over-
whelmingly prefer the site
across Concord Road for the
new library.

That site received 506 votes.
The nearest competitor was the
Lingle Manor site which re-
ceived 47 votes.

Student Body President Tom
Barnhardt stated that he felt re-
sponse was excellent. ‘People
did a good job filling out the
polls." He also stated the hope
that since no final decision has
been made, student opinion wil!
be studied carefully.

The site in front of Hast and
Cannon dorms was third, while
the location in front of Watts,
Little and the Guest House was
the fourth choice.

Student Opinion Committee.
man Chuck Green said, “I think
the students were taking this
poll seriously because they feel

that this is one area of campus
life where their voice must be

‘heard, and it is the job of the

Student Opinion Committee to
communicate effectively the stu
dents’ opinion to the administra-
tion.”

Green also said that a large
part of the questionnaires had
extra suggestions on them. **Lin-
gle Manor, the laundry and
Jackson Court were the sites
most often mentioned.” he said.

There were many other sites
suggested. such as across from
the ATO house and opposite
from the Cunningham Fine Arts
Center across Main Street.

When asked about the influ-
ence the poll would have in, the
committee's final decision. Fred
Sackett, assistant to the presi-
dent, said, “I think that. it will
be considered along with all
other factors by the library com-
mittee.”

TRUTH _ STRESSED
Scientist Explores Morality:

By JIM COOLEY
Staft Writer

The exciting and often ig-
nored relationship of science to
ethics and to the imagination

was explored by the third and.

last of this year’s Reynolds Lec-
turers, Dr. Jacob Bronowski, in
a.two-day visit to the Davidson
campus.

Born in Poland and educated
in England. Bronowski is pres-

ently a Senior Research Fellow |

at the Salk Institute for Biolog-
ical Studies in San Diego, Calif.
Although trained as a mathema-
tician. he has made important
contributions to intellectual his-
tory. the philosophy of science,
and the scholarship of William
Blake.

Bronowski addressed the stu.
dent body in chapel Tuesday
morning on the topic ‘‘Science
and Ethics’. His lecture Tues-
day evening dealt with ‘‘Sci-
ence and the Imagination’. In
addition. Bronowski further dis-
cussed his ideas at coffee hours
Tuesday and Wednesday in the
Morrison Room.

“We have been taught,”
Bronowski contended tn Tues-
day’s chapel, “that science
does not have an ethic. Sci-
ence is neutral. 1 does not
tell us how we ought fo act.’
But between 1945 and 1953, he
admitted discovering a fallacy
in this belief.

What he recognized was that
science was changing people's
attitude toward life. But if sci-
ence were simply a “large loose
bundle of facts.’’ it could have
meant nothing in this respect.

Instead Bronowski visualized
science as progressing through
people doing things and then re-
porting what they had done.
“Science is a cooperative proc-
ess,”’ he said. “It is wrong to
think that it could have been in-
vented by one man if he had
worked hard enough.’ Science

Current Athletic Policy
Endorsed By Trustees

Present Subsidization Held!
Not Inconsistent With Goals

The faculty received Tuesday
a trustee recommendation that
the current subsidization of ath-
letics be maintained.

The recommendation, in the
form of a report passed last
week during the trustees’ spring
meeting. concluded that a con-
tinuation of the present system
of subsidization was not incon-
sistent with the goals of the
college.

The trustees’ action came in
response to a petition signed by
68 faculty members and pre

sented to the board a year ago.
The petition was hot adopted by
the faculty as a whole.

The faculty petition requested
that the living endowment he
disassociated from the system
of grants inaid for athletes.

It also recommended the elim
ination of athletic scholarships
as they are presently adminis-
tered.

In reply, ‘the trustees ex-
plained that the current pro-
gram is probably cheaper over.

pends on the condition that the
individua! scientist as well as
his contemporaries are ‘telling
the truth”.

The idea of “telling the
truth’? emerged from Bronow- |
ski’s remarks as the basic
ethica! value of the scientific |
community. 14 led to a condi-
tion in which each member of
fhe community could depend |
upon the truthfulness of the
work of his fellows.

But a problem was raised.
when thjs ethic came into con-
tact with those who were not,
members of the scientific com
munity. Bronowski asked the
controversial question, ‘‘How
ought science to behave tn a so-
eietv in which scientists tell the
truth but in which others are
more interested in making the
front page?”’

In concluding his remarks !
Bronowski recetnized the sci |

expressed, however, and will

The college expects to earn

This will cover administration

the college hopes to earn about’
$750.000. Such funds come from
money earned from students’

From the living endowment. ,
$380 thousand will be appropriat-
ed for student aid.

To balance the budget, reserve
funds built up by the college will
be dipped into $76,000 as was
done this year. Currie said that
they hope to be able to balance
the budget without dipping into
these funds in 1968-69 with addi-

“STAMP OUT REALITY”
McKellar Sports His Wares

Davidson Pinned

By Button Craze

Staff Writer
Davidson students are getting
stuck on a craze for slogan bear
ing buttons.
Buttons “Chaste

of the wares that Bob McKellar

‘and Ken Tarleton are selling on
, campus.

McKellar and Tarleton said
that they had started selling
these buttons in recent weeks
after seeing an advertisement
in a hippie magazine. Evergreen
Review. They inquired about the
ad and found that they were eli-
gible as sales representatives.

Other examples of the topical
buttons include such slogans as
“Stamp Out Reality.” “Kill A
Commie For Christ,” “I Only
Followed Orders,"' ‘Jewish Pow-
er’’ and other selections of a
more coarse nature.

Both McKellar and Tarleton
said that they initially planned
to sell the buttons just to their

Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity
brothers. “*Then it started mush-
rooming.” McKellar said.

“We placed an order for
170 buttons and most students
bought about two ofr three but-
tons “° Because of the volume of
business, the buttons were sold
at a cheaper price. than the
company could sell them.

Tarleton said there were four
major categories of buttons: an-
ti war. obscene, hippie and anti-
establishment.

Both Tarleton and McKellar
hypothesized that one could tell
a lot about peopte by the but-
tons they buy. The obscene but.
tons, the best sellers on campus,
revealed much about students
at Davidson.

Mainly, it showed a ‘‘disap-
pointing lack of culture.” ac-
cording to McKellar and Tarle-
ton. Jokingly. they said, “We
feel that this (the purchase of
obscene buttons) is an essen-
tial negation of authentic exis-
tence."
