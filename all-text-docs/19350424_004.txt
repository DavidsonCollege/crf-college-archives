TEX AND TECH

None other than Coach “Tex” Tilson
paid a visit to the Wildcats lair last
week, “Tex,” a former Davidson men-
tor and now track coach at Virginia
Tech, had plenty of smiles ready for
his former acquaintances here besides a
bag full of tricks which finally enabled
the Gobblers to win by a little over 7
points.

Laying a confiding hand upon the re-
porters’ shoulders, the tall and good-
natured mentor prepared for the verbal
bombardment that followed.

Questioned about how he felt
about being at Davidson and pull-
ing a victory over his old charges
“Tex” replied, “It’s a good feeling
to be back at Davidson and a good
feeling to be able to beat David-
son.”

Explaining that he was a V.P.I.
man, Tilson replied that next to
Tech he was always for David-
son.

Asked whether his present
track team was above average,
“Tex” replied that it was aver-
age in the sprints and weights,
above average in the distances
(half mile and two mile), and a
little below average in the pole
vault and javelin. Tilson. also
added that his star pole vaulter
had to “drop out because of an
appendicitis operation.”

In closing Tex stated that he liked
his job at V. P. I. “very much.”
FARE THEE WELL

A real treat was staged by
_Earle Frazier and Mothershead of
V. P. IL. in the mile and half-mile
runs. Earle took the lead up to the
last 20 yards of both events but
from there the situation changed.
According to statements made by sev-

eral of the visiting cadets, Mothershead
always follows the leading man until
the home stretch is approached in order
to make his “effective sprint” much more
effective.

Needless to say, Earle deserves a lot
of credit although he didn’t cop first
honors. It was apparent that Mother-
shead exerted more than ordinary effort
in effecting a win. Even so, however,
this column takes occasion to acknow-
ledg® the Tech star as one of the best
distance runners here in recent
years.

MOANIN’ LOW )

Starting out Friday afternoon,
the baseball team looked as though
it were out for revenge, leading
the Dukes by one point until the
sixth inning, when the count was
knotted. In the tenth inning, Nak-
tenis added the margin.

Saturday was an off day in more
ways. than one. An injury to
Catcher Ravenel’s arm started a
period of substitutions that played
havoc with the the Wildcats line-
up, leaving only about two men
in their original position at the
end of the game.

WATCH OUT FOR WINDOWS

The big knock-’em down and drag-
‘em off intramural baseball is in our
midst again and indications point to a
season that will make the
Giants sick with envy.

So far the Sophs have devoured
all competition in sight, having
aa, A the c~4 ey and
freshman teams. Bud Hunter,
“right underhander” has been siz-
alin’ the big bad ball over the plate
for the second year men while
Bondurant, Elder, Branton, and
accordin’ to Bud, the whole trio
of fielders too are all sharing
honors. ‘‘Goofy” Cooke, besides
holdin’ down a first position has
been “Whoopin’ it up” to give
added impetus.

In the other departments, the Seniors
seem to be doing “next best,” and at
the time this article was written, they
were busily engaged in mopping up the
Juniors. The score has been withheld
by request (of the Juniors.) Dewey
Hutchins and Archie Legare were the
heavy batteries for the Seniors.

DUKE WINS IN TENTH
Davidson Gets Three Hits As
Devils Win Slugfest
The Davidson baseball team lost two
games to the Duke’ team at Durham last

Friday and Saturday.
Duke 3; Davidson 2

In the opening game, Don Mitchell's
single with Naktenis on third with two
men out in the last half of the tenth
inning’ gave the Blue Devils a hard-
fought victory. This run terminated a
beautiful pitcher's duel between Charlie
Harris and Pete Naktenis. Charlie
showed his best form of the season in
holding Duke to seven hits, while the
Cats were able to get only four safetys
off the Southpaw slants of Naktenis.

Davidson scored her two runs in the
third inning by combining three walks
and a sacrifice with a hit and a wild
pitch. Michaels hit a home-run’ into
right field for the first Duke run, and
other came in the sixth as a result of
two hits and a stolen base.

Jim Morgan not only led the Wildcat
batters but he provided the fielding fea-
ture of the game.

Batteries: Harris and Ravenel;
tenis and Wagner.

Duke 13; Davidson 0

A barrage of sixteen base hits gave
Duke a one-sided 13-0 victory over Dav-
idson in the second game of the series.

Reynolds May went the entire route
for Duke, and, in blanking the 'Cats he
held them to three hits. Jack Jenkins
started for Davidson, retired in favor
of Lefty Porter for two thirds of an
inning, and then returned to the mound
for the remainder of the game. The
Blue Devils had two big innings, “the
second and the third, when they scored
five runs in” each. Huiskamp led the
Duke attack with four hits in four tries,
while Burns, Morgan, and Jenkins got
Davidson's three hits.

Chosen Last Week by Popular
Vote Of Varsity Track
Lettermen

Douglas M. Glasgow, of Charlotte,
N. C., better known among students of
Davidson as “Duke,” was elected cap-
tain of the varsity track squad for the
present 1935 season.

Glasgow succeeds Fred McPhail, also
of Charjotte, who was elected captain
of the team at the beginning of the
season but was forced to decline this
position, because of an appendicitis oper-
ation, which necessitated his dropping
out of active participation in intercol-
legiate competition.

As the local team began to encounter
competition with other track teams, it
became evident that a captain would be
needed and so Assistant Coach “Pete”
Whittle made a visit to each letterman
on the squad and asked him to make
a’ selection for captain. After tabulat-
ing all votes, “Duke” was selected by
a fairly good sized majority.

Glasgow, the new Captain, is a mem-
ber of Phi Delta Theta social fraternity,
the “D” Club, and is an active partici-
pant in both intercollegiate and igtra-
mural athletics. He has served on the
track squad for four years.

Interest In Intramural
Baseball Being Revived

This year as in no other year, the
intramural baseball program has been
highly successful. The interest in the
popular pastime has mounted consider-
ably since last year.

The sophomores, ably led by Joe Hun-
ter, have so far been able sto hold their
lead on the top. Quoting, Capt. Joe
Hunter of the Centennials, “we have
one of the most airtight infields in the
league,” to say nothing of other mem-
bers of the team. The Sophomores have
played two games, one against the jun-
iors and one against the seniors, and they
tamed the fourth year men by the score

of 19-4,

One of the most spectacular plays yet
pulled in the current intramural! season
was a triple play by the Sophomores
against the seniors. The bases were
loaded and there were no outs for the
seniors when a line drive was caught
by Chas. Elder, the Soph. shortstop and
he threw to the second baseman who in
turn threw to first for the third out to
retire the Seniors. For the Sophomores,
Bill Bondurant, Charles Elder, Joe Hun-
ter and Bill Bradford have shone in re-
cent games. The Seniors are held to-
gether mainly by Archie Legare and
Hugh Yelverton. The Freshman main-

‘stays are Capt. Rainey, Dixon, and Fai-

son. The Juniors, are led by Bill Bell,
Capt. Jom Cothran, and a new addition,
“Six” Johnson.

Mothershead, V. P. I Flash, De-
feats Earle Frazier In
Feature Event

TURNER IS TECH STAR

Deyerle, Pittman, Newton. and
Melton Take Firsts

The cinder artists of Virginia Poly-
technic Institute defeated the varsity and
the freshman track teams here at Rich-
ardson Field in a doubleheader which
was run off simultaneously. The score
in the varsity meet was Davidson 5914;
Virginia Tech 6634.

The feature event of the afternoon
was the renewal of the mile run duel
between Earle Frazier, the Wildcat

champion, and Mothershead, the V. P. I.
flash. Earle, having just recovered from
an annoying cold which had been ham-
pering for some time, hit his best time
as yet in this season when he ran a 4.25
mile. Frazier led the Gobbler star by
about five paces all the way until about
the last twenty yards when Mothershead
put on a terrific sprint to beat Frazier
by about four yards. The two favorites
began their duel early as at the gun,
‘Frazier took the lead with Mothershead
on. his heels, leaving the rest of the
field far behind. Mothershead stayed
right behind Frazier, matching ‘him
stride for stride until the last twenty
yards. Both runners, especially Frazier
turned in a very splendid performance
in spite of the condition of the track,
which was slow. Later on the program,
the same thing happened on a_ smaller
scale in the half mile. Earle, with a
small lead on his opponent, was over-
taken about ten yards from the tape.
For the Gobblers, Turner looked es-
pecially impressive as he won the 220,
the 440, and placed second to his team-
mate in the century dash, piling up a
total of 13 points in three events.
Billy Merchant, trying the two mile
for the first time this season, (he h4d
been running the mile) turned in a beau-
tiful performance and lacked only a few
feet of conquering “Wee Willie” Bell,
For the Wildcats,
