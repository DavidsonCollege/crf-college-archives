World’s Fastest Human Scheduled to |
Address Davidson Students Next Fall.

Records of Former

Stars Will be Kept

The Athletic Council of Davidson Col-
lege convened on March ninth and sevy-
eral new measures were discussed and
passed. Chief among these was that a
record book should be compiled contain-
ing the names, positions, and activities
of all men who have ever had the priv-
ilege of wearing the coveted “D” of this
college for participation in some major
sport.

The purpose of this measure is to form
ultimately a club consisting of D Club
men, This club will fill a long felt want
among the former athletes of Davidson
College who find themselves almost en-
tirely forgotten only a short time after
they leave the college for the last time.
It essentially just that the memories
of the sterling athletes of former times
be preserved as a memoriam of the serv-
ices which they Davidson on

This scholarship was
years ago by Cecil Rhodes of South
rica. The scholarship provides funds to
pay the expenses of two men from each
state, two from the District of Columbia,
and students from colonies of England,
the provinces of Canada, Australia, New
Zealand, and. India. Four hundred
pounds sterling are given to each Rhodes
Scholar annually for a period of three
years.

The Rhodes Scholars, when they ar-
rive at Oxford, may pursue any branch
of graduate work that they wish. Many
of the students merely continue in the
field in which they majored in college
and take work leading to a higher degree
so they can become professors in Amer-
ican universities and colleges. Among
the fields of work pursued the leading is

Rhodes Scholars who have returned to
America are now beginning to occupy im-
portant posts in universities and colleges
in nearly all states of the union. Per-
haps the most conspicuous of these is
President Aydelotte, of Swarthmore Col-
lege, Pennsylvania. President Aydelotte
is the representative of the Rhodes
Scholarship in America. He is the head
of a group of former Rhodes Scholars,
|who are now professors in American
schools, who are leading the way to the
establishment an Honors Course in
American universities and colleges for
| high grade students. Next year’s cata-
logue of Davidson College will contain an
anouncement of such a course. It will
consist mostly of a reading course for
