Johnson Sweeps Mock Election In Landslide;
Goldwater Slips By Lodge For Republicans

Barring Catastrophe, LBJ
Will Win By Huge Edge

BY DAVID STITT

Barring some completely unforseen catastrophe, Lyndon Johnson will win the
1964 Presidential election by an awesome landslide.

Recent nationwide polls, con-
ducted to determine the popular-
ity of various presidential candi-
dates, have consistently shown
that 75 per cent or better of the
American voters are satisfied
with Johnson and would favor
him over any other candidate.

Obviously he cannot maintain
a lead like that for too long, but
even if he does not, who's going
to beat him? No other Democra-
tic candidate is even under con-
sideration, and so far the Re-
publican showing ‘hasn’t been
very strong.

Barry Goldwater has long
passed his high-water mark. Be-
fore the November assassination
of President Kennedy, Goldwat-

‘er had picked up a phenomenal-
ly loyal following, but he was
building his campaign on a
shaky foundation of attacks on a
personality. Then the personali-
ty wasn't there any more and
the bottom fell out. That plus the
fact that because the assassina-
tion happened in Dallas, a wide-
spread distrust of the extreme
right (which must be linked with
Goldwater) exists despite its
having been cleared by the in-
vestigators of any part in the
assassination.

Goldwater has since been at-

tempting to bulld the same
type of campaign via ea ser-
jes of attacks on President
Johnson and his poltcies, but
because of Johnson's tremen-
dous popularity, Goldwater Is
largely falling fiat on his face.

Nelson (Hiya) Rockefeller has
strong qualifications and a good
record as New York governor,
but his ideas are not that dif-
ferent from Johnson's and he
has personal problems going
against him.

Harold (Boy Wonder) Stas-
sen’s chances look rather slim,
and Henry Cabot Lodge is not
known well enough to offer a
serious threat. William Scran-
ton and George Romney likewise
suffer from underexposure, and
Romney is having troubles of
his own in Michigan now. And
finally, although Richard Nixon
is certainly well-known, he is
best known to millions of Ameri-
cans as a two-time loser, and if
he runs again, he may have. to

,do something about his foot be-
ing in his mouth as far as the
press is concerned.

‘Boy Wonder’ Dick Nixon

Whoever Is finally nominated
to run ageinst Johnson. will
probably attack the President
on three counts. First, on the
grounds that Johnson is “pro-
vincial’” and thus will have
trouble with foreign policy;
secondly Johnson’s so-called
“wheeler-deater’’ method of
operation will be assailed; and

JOHNSON

thirdly, Johnson wilt be calted
“two-faced” for his stands on
certain Issues, oddly ercugh
including civil rights.
Johnson's knowledge of foreign
affairs was no doubt limited
prior to his becoming Vice-Presi-

dent in 1960, but in that office
he was given what amounted to
a cram course in foreign policy.
In 1961 he went to Southeast
Asia and continued around the
world. Later that year he went
to Berlin when the wall went up.
In 1962 he went to the Middle
East, and in 1963 travelled to
Scandinavia and other European
countries.

As for the second charge,
Johnson's favorite quotation
is one from Isalah, “Come
now, let us reason together.”
We is often portrayed as a
“‘wheeler-dealer,” and there
is ‘no denying that he Is an
active politician.

He is a master at effecting
continuing compromises . which
eventually get him where he
wanted to go to begin with.

The latest charge of wheeler-
dealering to be brought against
Johnson involves, of course, Bob-
by Baker, but such is far from
the first charge of that nature.

Perhaps the most frequently-
mentioned dealerism which may
or may not have involved John-
son occurred in 1948 when LBJ
was running against former
Texas Governor Coke Stevenson
for the Senate. Johnson won the
election by 87 votes out of 988,-
295 cast after some votes arrived
late from South Texas. Steven-
son charged fraud, but the votes

Effective And Decisive Leadership’

BY PHILIP B. SECOR
Professor of Political Science

This is my week for political frustration! Yesterday, my self-imposed task was to compose a letter to Senator

Sam Ervin, Jr., urging him to support the Civil Rights Bill. (Wow!) Toda

my task is to urge the presidential

candidacy of Nelson Rockefeller to a largely conservative and southern audience. Obviously many, if not most, of
you hold political values (opinions?) different from mine so my arguments are not likely to convince you. About all
I can hope to do is to tell you why I favor Rockefeller and how I see him distinguished from the other presidential

candidates now in the field.

Mostly, I'm fed up with the
lack of commitment and moral
indecisiveness which I see as
characteristic of American. poli-
tical leadership since the early
decades of this century.

This indecisiveness -has, it
seems to me, taken two major
directions: (1) the _ short,
frightened stop and start step-
pings of the political pragma-
tists: here we have seen the
respectable cloak of ‘‘realism,"
“practicality,” “common”
sense," and **moderation”

‘Goldwater Can Win’
As Only Conservative

BY BRUCE STEIGNER

It is my belief that Senator Barry Goldwater can win the 1964 election for the
Presidency of the United States. :

Senator Goldwater is the lead-
ing candidate for the Republi-
can nomination, and the only
conservative candidate for the
Presidency itself.

Senator Goldwater has often
been criticized by his many
“Liberal’’ opponents for his
stand on practically all issues,
forelgn and domestic. I shall
undertake to set forth the Sena-
tor’s position on these basic is-

‘sues as I see it:

First, in the field of foreign

relations, Goldwater favors a
firm stand against our Commun.
ist enemies: he would threaten
to withdraw diplomatic relations
from the USSR in order to gain
major concessions from them,
e.g.. removal of the Berlin Wall,
free elections in Cuba. Specifi-
cally, Goldwater would attempt
to enforce the Monroe Doctrine
in Cuba by setting up a strict
blockade of Cuba and by sup-
plying massive aid and en-
couragement to anti-Castro un-

Dodging Political Anonymity

BY BOB STRAUSER

Once the Boy Wonder of the Republican Party, Richard M, Nixon faces a differ-
ent task in 1964, at the age of 51, merely in escaping political anonymity. Today, at a!

time when most of his political virtues have been forgotten, many of his past sins |

have returned to haunt him.

After his discharge from the
Navy in 1945 (He had reached
the rank of Lieutenant Com-
mander), he accepted an invi-
tation from the California Re-
publican organization to run for
the House of Representatives.
In 1946 he defeated New Deal
champion Jerry Voorhis for the
office and was re-elected in ‘48.

In 1949 Nixon resigned from
the House to run for the Senate
against Helen Gahagan Douglas.
As a Representative he had been
active in the House_Un-Ameri-
can Activities Committee’s in-
vestigation of Alger Hiss and
Whittaker Chambers. Once again
a candidate, Nixon made much
political hay from his anti-Com-
munist record, Mrs. Douglas was
subjected to an investigation
of her voting record in the
House, where she had served
on the Foreign Affairs Commit-
tee.

The campaign quickly be-
came a heated one. Mrs.
Douglas accused her opponent
of “witch hunting;” her staff
claimed Nixon was responsi-
ble for a telephone whispering
campaign. Nixon retorted that
Mrs. Douglas’s election would
be a blow to Americanism.
After the outbreak of hostili-

tles in Korea, Mrs. Douglas
was ruined, along with many
other Democratic candidetes,
by her association with the

NIXON

administration. Nixon carried
the election by 670,000 votes,
winning all but 7 California
Counties.

After serving undramatically
in the Senate for 2 years. Nixon
was an attractive choice to fill
out the Eisenhower ticket in

1952. In the late summer of 1952,
however, he came under Demo-
cratic charges of accepting
campaign money for _per-
sonal use. at a cost of $75.-
000, Nixon appeared before a
national television and radio au-
dience to explain his situation.

In the now famous ‘‘Check-
ers’’ speech, he painted a pic-
ture of a striving, near-desti-
tute young patriot fighting for
the survival of America. He
pointed out that his wife wore
‘ta good Republican, cloth coat"
because he could afford no bet-
ter; he noted he had received a
dog from some admirers. His
children had named the dog
“Checkers and were quite at-
tached to it.

With all the vehemence he had
poured forth in his HUAC at-
tacks, he absolutely refused to
give up the dog. In conclusion,
and as somewhat of an anti-
climax, he produced a state-
ment from Price, Waterhouse
and Co. of Los Angeles to the
effect that he had not profited
from campaign contributions
which had loaned $18,235.

The public response to the
speech was favorable and Nixon

He would abandon the Yalta-
type strategy that is forcing
us out of the Far East and
draining our strength in a no-

words, “The major objective
of US foreign policy should be
the reduction of Communist

What I like about Rockefeller
is what I will call his obvious
love of life and power, his
healthy and creative sense of
humor about the moral demands
of power in an era which lacks
much faith as to the proper di-

“sense of humor’’ a la Professor
Bliss’ excellent lecture in Hu-
menitles 22 on “humor’’ and the
“comic’’ response to the human

Rockefeller impresses me—
and maybe he’s just good at
fooling politically liberal aca-
demicians—as the most literate,
morally decisive, and clearly-
positioned of the candidates. I
think I can say of Rockefeller
that I support him because (1)
I know what he regards as the
best response to some problems,
(2) I agree with most of these
responses, (3) he seems to have
the intelligence and experience
necessary to make a noble effort
to realize his ideas. Of course I

Adams: ‘Scranton Would
Run In Case Of Deadlock’

BY BOB ADAMS

Self-assured, conservative William Warren Scranton of Peansylvannia has changed
the outlook of his constituency from defeatism to confidence since assuming the gov-
ernorship in January, 1963. His leadership has won him high standing in the list of
Republican presidential possibilities. yet Scranton remains non-committal about his

entering the race.

At present, Scranton is ill-
equipped to enter a_ national
contest, lacking funds and grass-
roots organization despite Phil-
adelphia industrialist Tom Mce-
Cabe's efforts to advertise the
governor's virtues to select
groups of Republican influentials
across the country.

Time still remains to create
a national organization within
the party. assert Scranton sup-
porters like Dwight Eisenhower.
but all agree that the young
aristocrat must make a com.
mitment soon after March 10 or
shelve his national bid for anoth
er four years.

Why March 107 This is the.
date of the New Hampshire
primary, the first of three which
will either determine the Repub
lican candidate or open the race
to Scranton and other G.O.P.
hopefuls, The New Hampshire,
Oregon, and California primar
ies will definitely eliminate
Scranton as a potential nominee
if they produce an irrepressible
trend toward cither Rockefeller
or Goldwater.

Even if the primary results
show a toss.up in New Hamp
shire and further indecision in
Oregon, Scranton supporters do
not guarantee that their leader
will seek nomination. Scranton
likes to be assured he will have
sotid backing as indicated by his
reluctance to run for governor
in 1962 until every G.O.P. county
chairman in Pennsylvania had
pledged his support.

If the primaries should indl-

cate a deadlock between
Rockefeller and Goldwater,
Republicans will be anxiously
seeking insurance against the
disaster of party indecision.
Scranton would most likely
accep! a nomination under
such conditions.

prominence but his numerous
accomplishments merit national

In 1959, John Foster Dulles
asked Bill Scranton to become
his personal, high-level briefing
officer. A year later, Scranton
returned to his native 10th Con-

draft for the House. He carried
his district by 17,000 votes the
year Kennedy polled 15,000 in
the same district.

Dwight Eisenhower in 196)

man to run for governor. -Scran-

Now, Eisenhower is urging the
