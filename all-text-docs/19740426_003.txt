McManus’56 Discusses Job, Nixon

By MATTHEW COVINGTON
Asst. Managing Editor

Jason Donald McManus’
high school graduating class
voted him ‘‘Most Likely To
Succeed"’, and his obedience
to their portention has been
both exact and complete. A
graduate of Davidson College
and later Princeton Univer-
sity, McManus has risen
through the ranks of his fellow
journalists to a postition which
allowed him to manage Time
Magazine in all the facets of
pe chronicle during the months

ebruary and March just
passed }

McManus is properly the
National Affairs Editor of
Time and _ became its
managing Editor for two mon-
ths as a result of ‘‘some
political workings at Time
that I’m sure you're not in-
terested in’’. He described
these workings and his work
with Time in an informal talk
Monday in the Union.

“There is some question as
to who the next managing
editor will be. There are three
of us in the running for the job
and the managing editor pret-
ty well runs the magazine. As
a part of being in the running,
each of us is given a turn at the
position. My turn was during
February and March, that’s
all,” he said.

As National Affairs Editor,

McManus is in charge of
editing The Nation section,
usually the first 10 to 15 pages
of the weekly newsmagazine.
“This has mostly been a
Watergate section in the last
year to the exclusion of other
national news,’ he com-
mented.

McManus also described the
complex series of checks that
each article goes through

before publication. ‘‘By putting
a dot above every word, the
researcher testifies to its ac-
curacy, spelling and syntax,”’
he said.

McManus graduated Phi
Beta Kappa from Davidson
with a major in English and a
minor in psychology in 1956.
He was president of Omicron
Delta Kappa, Sigma Upsilon,
and Phi Delta Theta.

His writing potential was
easily discernable, as he won
the Willa Cather, the Vereen
Bell, and the Woodrow Wil-
son Award for creative writ-
ing during his senior year.

His work with the DAVID-
SONIAN was limited, yet he
was the author of a kind of
miniature Kinsey report, an
article about conversing with
blind dates.

McManus. received his
Masters Degree in Public Af-
fairs from Princeton in 1958.
It was during the summer
between his two years there
that he began his work with
Time.

“I had read a book by the
editor of Fortune that im-
pressed me very much. I
wrote to him asking for a sum-
mer internship that would in-
volve sitting in his lap. He
wrote back and told me that
they were much to busy to
babysit but that he would send
my letter on the personnel
department

As a result, I was placed
in & summer job. Four days
later I found myself 16 feet
in the air, putting headlines
about Crazylegs Hersch on
a net at the baseball field in
Chicago,” he said. .

The internship with Sports
Illustrated of the Time Inc.
syndicate was useful to Mc-
Manus, but the following year
he left for Oxford on a Rhodes
Scholarship. During his stay
in England, he served on
Time's London bureau.

McManus described his
time at Oxford by saying, ‘‘I
didn’t study much. I wanted to
do some surveys on people in
the area but it was a new idea
and I don’t think they had
triedanything new since 1780.”

McManus returned to this
country after a year at Oxford
and was a Time writer for the
years 1959-60. These were the
formative years of the Com-
mon Market (founded in 1957)

and so after a 9 month sojourn
with the international banking
firm B. Sonnenberg, Mc-
Manus volunteered and was
selected for a newly-created
position as Time’s Common
market Chief.

His new work sent him to
Paris, but his area of concern
was with all the Common
Market countries.

In 1964, McManus assumed
his current position as
National Affairs Editor.

In his Monday morning
talk, McManus spoke on what
he called ‘“‘Two of the most
depressing aspects of the
Watergate affair’’.

He first noted that after the
seething decade of the 1960's,
what America needed most
was a period of tranquility to
lick its wounds. ‘‘Through the
excess of the Nixon Ad-
ministration and the exposal
of them, America has been
denied of this. This, I think, is
a central part of the whole
tragedy,"’ he said.

McManus spoke also of the
effects that Watergate will,
and has, had on the country.
‘‘Whatever happens, there
will be many bitter
Americans. If nothing is done
to Nixon, there will be many
Americans outraged that the
President can get away scott
free with what the average
man would have gone to jail
for.

“And if Nixon is impeached,
there will be those Americans
bitter because he was unfairly
hounded out of the office that
he was elected to perform.
Either way, it's a sad choice.”’
he said.

Speaking of the effects of the
pressure on the President
McManus said, ‘I know that
Nixon is concerned, but who
wouldn’t be.. Nixon is having
trouble sleeping and Pat has
said that sometimes he will go
to bed early, say 12:00, and
wake up at 3:00, unable to get
back to sleep. This is often
why he looks so terrible in his

pictures and at press con-
ferences.

‘‘He sometimes drinks a bit
much. I don’t mean that he
has gin on the breakfast table
or anything, I just think that
sometimes the President and
Bebe Rebozo will get together
and get plastered, that's all,”
he said.

McManus admits that
Nixon's private life is difficult
to document, owing to his
nature. “The President is
anomalous in that he is not a
politician in the truest sense.

the world as I see it. Now why
do you say all those nasty
things about me’.”

Nixon could never do that
kind of thing, according to Mc-
Manus. ‘It’s a real shame too,
that sort of thing is extremely
effective,"’ McManus said.

McManus also observed
that only one journalist has
spoken individually with the
President since his reelection.

“‘So much of what we know
comes from Ron Ziegler. one
of Nixon's bright advertising
executives who don’t know

Omicron Delta Kappa

At Spring Convocation the following 16 per-
sons were elected into the national fraternity
Omicron Delta Kappa. Criteria for selection
was leadership in five areas, scholarship,
athletics, student government and social and
religious affairs, publications, and speech,
music, drama and the other arts.

He is uncomfortable in public
and this makes it hard on him.
Nixon has never been able to
wine and dine journalists like
Kennedy was able to and thus.
they never feel like he is
taking them into his con-
fidence. This is partly respon-
sible for the bad press that he
is famous for.

“Kennedy is said to have in-
vited journalists to the White
House and, putting an arm
around their shoulder, led
them over to the window
looking out from the Oval Of-
fice and say, ‘Look out and see

much about politics, and a
man so slippery that he’s
slimey; in fact, he’s unc-
tious,”’ he said.

McManus said in his talk
Monday that the value of the
mass media has been to
spread the news farther and
more quickly than is possible
in print, but that this fact has
not hurt the magazine
business, and in fact, radio
and television have stimulated
the appetite of the American
people for the more detailed
and comprehensive reporting
that only printed news can
provide.

Construction Of Townhouses

Approved by

By CHARLES KENNON
Asst. Managing Editor

On Feb. 23, the Trustee
Executive Committee ap-
proved plans forthe building of
off-campus townhouses to be
ready for the 1975-76 academic
year. In this meeting, the
trustees narrowed the con-
sideration of what type of
housing to build down to two of
four proposals, both of these
for townhouse complexes.

College Business Manager
Robert A. Currie explained
that since the February
meeting, no contractor has
been chosen, but that other
decisions have been reached.
“Since each of the two
proposals involves a _ long-
term lease with the college,
we decided that college owner-
ship would give the lowest
rates for the students.

“It has also been decided
that only 40, instead of the
original 60 units would be able
to reach state housing
requirements by the fall of
1975. These units are planned
in such a way that more can be

added as
Currie said.

‘‘We currently plan to have
24 two-bedroom units, housing
four students, and 16 three-
bedroom units, eacn housing
six students. This gives a total
of spaces for 192 students.

“The rooms will have two
baths, carpeting, a
refrigerator, stove, dish-
washer, and disposal. We
estimate that the total project
cost will be from $850,000 to
$950,000 or $4400-§4900 per
student. The rent will be in the
neighborhood of $700 to $750
per student,’’ Currie con-
tinued.

Thus, the long-range em-
phasis to solve the housing
shortage is on construction,
but the immediate problem is
the expansion of existing
buildings. Director of the
Physical Plant Grover C.
Meetze Jr. is optimistic about
the development of the
present bookstore area.

At present, there is no
deadline for the alteration of

housing, but Meetze has in-

dicated that ‘‘work will begin
as soon as possible and will be
completed as soon as
possible.

“I've drawn the plans and
we're ready to move. The
nearer we get to the end of the
year, the more we can have a
realistic schedule. It will all
depend on how fast we can
move the bookstore into the
basement of the Grey Union,”
Meetze said.

rising sophomore class,”’ she
said.
