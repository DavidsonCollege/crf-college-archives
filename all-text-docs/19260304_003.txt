Noted Junior Who Formerly

Now it came to pass in the third moon of
the reign of Tom, son of Baker, in the good
Iy land of Davidson, Bill, son of Christian,
did gird up his loins and wend his way te
Brenau, in the henighted land of Georgia,
on the other side of Chattahoochee, And Bill
thode there three days and as many nights,

And Bill, son of Christian, was a mighty
man of strong arms and brawny sinews; nor
was his countenance lit by womanly smiles,
But verily it was stern and grave like umto|
that of Pluto. Nor had Bill) the Mobilite |
yielded to the lure of charming women but |

Now it came to pass, that in the borders of
Brenau, yea, in the very heart of that virgin
sanetum, there did abide one female Known
as Delia, daughter of Simpkins, of the tribe
of Jones. And she was a woman of mighty
charm; and her hair was like the ebony of
India, while her glittered with much
glittering; her form was like unto that of
Gloria of the tribe of Swanson of the dis

Bill and knew him as her own,

Now it was in the eleventh hour of the
night when Delia did verily dazzle the eyes
of Bill, the Alabamite, when he did take it
upon himself to journey unto a moonlit gar
den in the walls of fair Gainesville. But the
maiden yielded not to Bill the Mobilite cyen
though the massive frame of the mighty Bill
did bow even unto her feet,
