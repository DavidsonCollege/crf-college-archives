EDITORIAL.

“He's a preacher, a man and a boy.”
With this happy phrase were Dr. Grra-
ham's qualities once summed up when
he was pastor of the Presbyterian!
church here. His residence in Lexing-
ton since and his change of work has
not changed him, and = Dr. Graham
comes to the church this week for a
series of special services with the same
freshness, vigor, earnestness and appeal
to old and young which characterized
his former pastorate here.

His friends of the town have warmly
welcomed him back, and much interest
is being taken in the services. “hey will
be a blessing and inspiration to the com-
munity. Yet it must be remembered
that one man, no matter how zealous
aad effective he may be in his speaking,
is powerless alone. He must have the
support and interest and = prayers of
every man and woman in the commun-
ity. Only thus will the meetings this
week be of lasting benefit to the life and
ideals of Davidson.

Te will be a privilege open to every
Davidson man to come into contact with
Dr. Graham and torm a friendship with
this “man and boy” who has deep and
sincere sympathy with the problems of

Pp,

SUPPORT THLE ANNUAL.

We call it “pep” to go out to the
athletic field and vell till our voices
crack. We have a fit every time one 0
our men “pastes the pill." And it's. well
that we support our athletics in such
grand style. But is athletics the only
side of our college that needs support.
What about that Annual? Have you
signed up yet? Remember that — the
poor editor has toiled unceasingly for a
year over the details of that publication;
that the manager has spoiled the classic
beauty of his immaculate white walls
with row on row of prosaic figures and
that every man on the staff has pulled
out manv a love lock in some fervid
moment of insniration. Tn all serious-
ness, fellows. do you think that you
show any college spirit when you try to
get out of paving the just price for a
publication which has taken so much
time and trouble? This week vou are
given a last chance to abtain one of the
best Annuals in the history of the col-
lege and to show’ your appreciation to
the men who have produced it. Take
advantage of this opportunity.
