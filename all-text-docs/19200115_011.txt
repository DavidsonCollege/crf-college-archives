Eumenean Society.

The Eumenean Society ° burst
forth into the eighty-third year of
its glory with such a program as has
not been seen in months, according
to the testimony of the reviewer
and several fellow members.

The question: Resolved, that the
R. O. T. C. should be continued in
all American colleges for the next
five years, was hotly contested and
vehemently argued by both sides.
The affirmative was upheld by J. C.
McCaskill, Cunningham, Mahood
and Carwile. They argued that the
experience of the past war has
shown that the United States needs
a Reserve Officers Corps and the R.
O. T. C. is the best solution of the
problem. The R. O. T. C. is both
‘beneficial to the colleges and to the
students, as wars will continue to
exist until the end of time.

of the affirmative and replied in very

snappy, oratorical
speeches, Cunningham argued that
the cost was too great for the benc-
fit derived by the government. A. P.
Ormand said that the time limit was
too short. J. P. Price argued that
the leading educators of the country
were opposed to military training in
American colleges. Doubles show-
ed that only one officer was turned
out by Davidson every year at the

cost of $6,000 to the government. |

Both the house and the judges were
unanimous in their decision for the
affirmative. J. C. Bailey held the
house spellbound by his rendition of
the immortal “Thanatopsis.” C. J.
Matthews delivered a timely ora-
tion on the subject, “Is the Literary
Society Worth While?” He stated
that the Eu was gaining her old
position of master over the Phi and
he urged every one to wake up and
get to work. Houston White con-
cluded the program with the famous
poem of service, the “Shooting of
Dan McGrew.” After a short busi-
ness session in which Paul C. Meny
was taken into the society, the house
adjourned.
Phi Society.

The Phi Society met in regular
debate Saturday night. W.C. Smith
conducted devotional exercises, and
corrected the minutes of the last
meeting.

The faculty of Davidson College
considers itself very fortunate in
being able to engage Prof. G. S.
Fullbright, instructor in elocution
and expression, for a period ‘of in-
struction. Professor Fullbright is
;a very capable man, having taken
|his academic work in Texas and his
professional work in Texas, Chicago
and Boston. He has for years been
an instructor of public speaking in
the Columbia Theological Seminary,
being very well known for his at-
-tainments in his department. there.
; He is not a stranger to Davidson
;men at all, having in previous years
‘been instructor in this institution
iwith marked success and satisfac-
‘tion.

He will be here for a period of a
month or more and during this time
will take over the Public Speaking
class, also giving instruction to the
‘entire Freshman class.

Fullbright to take up practical pub-

FOR LAST WEEK IN FEB.

Junior Speaking has been changed
somewhat this year and the present
plans arrange for the speaking to
begin on Friday and continue thru
Saturday, the 28th of February.

Fhe announcement of this date
was made to the Juniors before the
Christmas holidays and several of
the members of this class have avait-
ed themselves of this opportunity, as
they have already prepared those
masterly orations that reveal the
great quantity of knowledge gained
during three years of college. Pro-
fessor Currie has announced to the
class in .Public Speaking that the
Juniors will not be allowed to refer
to their manuscripts, as has been the
custom on previous occasions. The|
cause of this new ruling is unknown
but it is thought that the present!
Senior class may take their share of |
the blame without fear of interview
from any source.

The order of the exercises will
probably be: Friday afternoon, Fri-’
day night, Saturday morning and
Saturday afternoon, and Saturday!
night will be left vacant for the Glee '

club recital and fraternity reception.

DEBATING RECORD.

On Easter Monday, April 12, 1909,
Davidson College held its first intel-
collegiate debate. This debate was
held with Wake Forest, at Greens-
boro, N. C., and since that time 19
other contests have been held with
the leading colleges and universities
of the South.

Wake Forest was met in a series
of five debates, Davidson winning
three and losing two, and 4s a result
won the handsome ‘loving cup pre-
sented by the Winston-Salem Board
of Trade and Howard I. Ronthaler.
In 1910 and 191! Wofford College
was met, and by virtue of two
straight victories Davidson won an-
uther cup.

Series of three debates were held
with the University of S. C. and
Kmory CLiniversity. The represen-
tatives of the Red and Black were
successful in two out of three of the
contests with Emory, but lost by a
similar ratio to the other. It was
the first time the latter institution
had ever been defeatd in a series of
debates.

Davidson's crowning achievement
came last year when she defeated
both Washington and Lee Univer-
sity and Mercer University.

Intercollegiate debating is assum-
ing a greater and greater import-
ance among Davidson's activities,
the college having made a remark-
able record in this department of
work. The debaters representing
the college have made an excellent
reputation for their ability and pow-
er in argumentation. More popular
interest is being taken cach year,
and prospects are very encouraging
for a future that will outshine even
the good record of the past.

The record is as follows:

1909—Aguainst Wofford, Davidson
lost.

1910—Against Wake Forest, Da-
vidson won.

1910—Against Wofford, Davidson
won,

1911—Against Wake Forest, Da-
vidson lost.

won,

vidson won.

He becomes impressed with the
idea that his college education is
deficient, that his knowledge of the
ancient languages, of metaphysics,
of calculus, etc., are of no real and
immediate value to him; then dis-
appointment and discouragement
will dampen his ambition and his
burden becomes twofold more on-
erous to bear and overcome.

Be hearty in co-operation with
the College. Indifference and half-
hearted co-operation is no asset but
a liability. We must be earnest,
sincere and whole-souled, if our co-
operation is to measure up to our
hopes and ideals of a greater and
better Davidson,

We should always have a kind
word for our Alma Mater and speak
it out boldly and fearlessly, if at

_times it be in the face of fierce rival-

ry and competition. We are fully
justified in claiming, with pride and
satisfaction, the success that the
Davidson boys have accomplished.
They have honored every sphere in
life and are to be found around the

‘top in every profession. Again, send

your boy to Davidson—it was good
enough for you and it is good
enough for him—it is better now
than ever before in its history and
will be better in the future. Futher-
more, | have never heard of an
Alumnus of the College express
regret or disappointment at having
reccived his diploma from Davidson,
but to the contrary, he looks upon
it with a feeling of pride and satis-
faction, and not only does it serve
as an emblem of his youth’s ambi-
tion realized but also, as an emblem
which brings back to him recoflec-
tions of his college days which grow
brighter and brighter as the years
go by.

Alumni Association.

S. A. LYNCH.

One of Davidson’s most successful
and prominent alumni is S. A.
Lynch, Tle entered here with the
‘class of 1905 from Asheville. He
stayed here only two years, but
during that time he made a record
in baseball that can never be sur-
passed by any one, He starred as
catcher for the team and so suc-
cessful was his career that he was.
called “Diamond” Lynch by every
one, When he was here the basebail
diamond was located at South Wing
Chambers, home plate being where ‘
the outdoor gym now stands. It
was during his stay here that the
present well known art of water
throwing was invented. The boys
used to sit along the wall of Cham-
bers and watch him catch; some
brilliant fellow conceived the idea
of cooling them off by throwing
water from upstairs, when they got
too hot rooting.

At present Mr. Lynch fives in At-
lanta. Ile is president of the S. A.
Lynch Enterprises Corporation,
which has its headquarters in At-
lanta, and is sole distributors of the
famous Art Craft and = Paramont
motion pictures in 17 Southern
States. He has controlling interest
in Keiths and the Broadway in
Charlotte and he also operates the-
atres in Atlanta, Augusta, Savan-
nah, Asheville and other cities. Da-
vidson should be justly proud that
she can claim such a man as Mr.
Lynch as an alumnus.

HOW MUCH A MILLION IS.

A student who entered Davidson
College in the year one and spent
five thousand a year would have
nearly a hundred years to go from
the present date to get rid of his
thousand thousand.
