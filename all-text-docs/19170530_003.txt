The Mimir Society of Davidson has
been recently founded for the purpose of
encouraging, furthering and honoring
scholastic attainments among the — stu-
dents. The right to membership is
wranted only to those students who have
made an average grade of as much as 93
for three consecutive vears. Further, no

student is eligible who, in any study, has
made less than ten points above the pass-
ing mark.

Thus the Mimir Society

aims to promote that which the college
stands for: intellectual training.

The emblem of the society is a small
key, which is in keeping with other hon-
orary society’s emblems. On the ob-
verse side of the key is Mimir and the
bird of wisdom. On the reverse side is
the name of the holder.
