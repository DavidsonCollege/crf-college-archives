We pitied the boys who had to study
geography and history after the Balkan
War, but that isn't a circumstances to
the way we feel for the poor guys who
have to draw a map of Europe after the
Peace Conference.

Why not have some individuality and

“Learn to chew over the thots your
professor hands to you—he wants you to,
Later on the world won't always furnish
you with such digestible material, and
a little practice now will help you
choose later. Don't swallow everything
whole. Do a little thinking and reason-
ing for yourself."—R. M.

THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY.

“The American University is a coffee
mill: young men and women are dump-
ed into it, some one spins the handle and
out they all come mixed together, indi-
viduality gone; all just the same; little
grains the same size, the same color, the
same smell.”

This quotation from a modern author
of some reputation represents a modified,
if not an entirely new atittude, toward
the American College.

Today those who prefer charges
against college training have to a great
extent abandoned the arguments which

of criticism which has been caught up
by those who depreciate the value of a
higher education and find in this indict-
ment a popular expression of their dis-
approval.

Granted that the American university
is a mill—into that mill is dumped in
heterogeneous confusion thousands of
young-men (and women), differing as to
race, creeds, home influences, social po-
sition, habits of life, habits of thought,
and inherited advantages. “hey undergo
a milling process which knocks off the
rough corners of — provincialism and
grinds to small bits many long-cherished
rights and privileges: “They no longer
find themselves the centers of little solar
systems but discover that they in com-
pany with multitudes of others reyolve
around great interests upon which the
attention of all is focused. “‘Individ-
uality gone?" Well, perhaps, but: what
a tremendous social gain! “Little grains
the same size, the same color, the same
smell?" But what a chaos of thought
and action would result from a differen-
tiation based upon individual fancy and
caprice! Put students together for four
years under the influence of college tra-
ditions and it would be strange indeed
if a certain uniformity of attitude and
habit of thought did not develop. This
is as true of the community or nation as
it is of the college and as a mere obser-
vation is valueless. Qune thing alone
concerns us: Is the attitude which the
college group develops magnanimous or
petty? Is its habit of thought whole-
some and healthy or is it malicious and
vengeful? Is its conduct fair and above
board or is it deceitful? 1f the ideals
are high nothing could be better than the
collegiate body be permeated with so de-
sirable a leaven. If the ideals are objec-
tionable, what folly is it then to lament
the fact that they are emulated! Rather
strive for their correction and improve-
ment and the very tendency which it is
claimed makes for monotonous sameness
will lift the American collegian to a

AT PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH

Last Sunday night, Dr. C. H. Pratt, a
returned missionary from Korea, made
his fifth talk for the day, in behaf of
the three and one-half million dollar
drive, soon to be attempted by — the
church.

Many interesting and instructive facts
were brought before the audience, such
as the large scale on which the world
has become accustomed to doing things

“The church,” he said.

both.”

He said “Democracy has been made
safe for the world, but pray that.it may
be made safe for Christ..”

He brought out the fact that the Sun-
day schools of today are not as good as
they were a year ago, that: people are
saying that Christianity has outgrown
the church and is trying to set it aside.
In closing, the request was made, “If
you cannot give, pray that someone who
can give, will give.”
