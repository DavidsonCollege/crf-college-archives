Board Soundly Rejects

Endorsement Proposal

By Sean Lind

Last Wednesday night The
Davidsonian editorial board over-
whelmingly rejected a proposal to
endorse SGA candidates. The
vote was 15-4. Editor-in-Chief
Jay Chaudhuri and Executive Edi-
tor Mark Puckett both dissented.

After interviews with the seven
SGA candidates were completed,
the endorsement idea was brought
forth for discussion. In arguing
against an endorsement Associate
Editors Joe Maris and Walter Price
felt that such a step would be both
unfairly bias and irresponsible.

“T realize that the intention of
the endorsement was to encourage
students to vote according to cre-
dentials rather than flyers, butI felt
that the endorsements would only
bring out bad blood against the
paper and that it would definetely
not be fair to the losing candi-
dates,” said Maris.

“Tt isn’t equitable that in a
school of 1400 students to select a
candidate without distinguishing

personal biases. Furthermore, the
process would be unfair because
there would be no time for candi-
dates to respond after the endorse-
ments by the paper were pub-
lished.,” said Price.

However, Chaudhuri and
Puckett held a different opinion.
“Obviously, I am disappointed,”
said Chaudhuri. “Because past
SGA elections have essentially
been a flyer and popularity con-
test, the idea of endorsing candi-
dates would only educate voters.
The board steered away from its
responsibilty.”

Concurred Puckett, “The issue
seems to be that this is a small
school and at a small school feel-
ings and egos might be wounded
by such an endorsement. So in-
stead, we will sce another typical
election in which cliques of friends
vote for friends because they don’t
have enough personal integrity to
step outside a friendship to choose
the best candidate with the best
platform.”

Consul General Holmes Discusses
Duties And British Politics

By Russ Tisinger

Last Tuesday in the Morrison
Room, Barry Holmes, British
Consul General in Atlanta, talked
to Davidson students about his
duties as Consul General, and
shared his views on events in the
Persian Gulf, the Soviet Union,
Europe, and post-Thatcher Great
Britain.

Mr. Holmes has been a mem-
ber of the British Foreign Service
since 1950. He took two years
leave to serve in the British Army
where he became a captain in the
Royal Artillery. He has worked
for the British Foreign Service in
Ecuador, Canada, and Kenya, and
for the last five years he has been
Commercial Counselor and Dep-

Nevertheless, the office serves as
an importantand accessible link to
the British government for Ameri-
can government and media.
Second, Mr. Holmes promotes
trade and investment between Brit-

.ain and the Southeastern states. He

facilitates and brings together will-
ing buyers, sellers, and investors
ineach country. Despite the popu-
larly held notion that Japan invests
too ‘heavily in the United States,
Great Britain remains the largest
single foreign investor in the Unites
States. Great Britain invests heav-
ily in the Southeastern states. She
is the foremost investor in the state
of Florida, and is the second heavi-
est investor in Georgia.

Finally, the Consul General

Mr. Holmes believes Prime M inister J ohn Majors
will rule in a less dogmatic or controversial fash-
ion than did the former Prime Minister Margaret

Thatcher.

uty Chief of Mission at the British
Consul General in Atlanta. Just
last November he was named
Senior Consul General.

As Consul General, Mr.
Holmes serves as a liaison be-
tween Britain and the Unites States
on economic, social, and political
issues, He is primarily respon-
sible, however, for relations with
the Southeastern States compris-
ing his parish. Mr. Holmes ap-
proaches his job with three chief
objectives in mind,

First, he represents Great Brit-
ain here and explains the actions
and policies of the British govern-
mentto American government and
media. For instance, during the
Falkland War, Mr. Holmes’ prede-
cessor was in constant demand for
comment on British action in the
war. More recently, Mr. Holmes
was wanted for comment on the

resignation of Margaret Thatcher.
Contrary to popular opinion, the
Consul General does not receive
any classified information that the
general public cannot obtain.

protects and aids British citizens
who visit the United States. For
example, passports are often lost
or stolen, and the British Consu-
late in Atlanta must replace them.
Holmes must also deal with Brit-
ish citizens committing crimes in
the United States. There are 25
Englishmen in jails across the
Southeast. Most were involved in
drug dealings, but there are two
men imprisoned for first degree
murder. With regard to occur-
rences such as these, the Consul
General takes care not to interfere
with the justice system in the United
States, butinstead relays to Britain
an accurate and positive impres-
sion of American justice.

Mr. Holmes also voiced his
opinions and those of the British
Government conceming the war
and recent events in the Soviet
Union, He expressed the view of
the British government that, de-
spite the fact that war is always
evil, it was in the end. the only
alternative. It was necessary to
prevent further aggression and

bloodshed in the future. He also
communicated his regret at the
apparent conservatism taking hold
in the Soviet government, and the
recent force used by Soviet troops
in dealing with the Baltic states’
efforts atachieving independence.

Mr. Holmes also spoke about
the future of the European Com-
munity. The twelve countries that
comprise the community are stead-
ily working towards achieving by
1992 a new European Community
characterized by what they call the
“four freedoms,” They areattempt-
ing to gain ‘free and uninhibited
passage of goods, capital, people,
and services from one country to
another. Mr. Holmes is confident
that only the uninhibited passage
of people might not occur as soon
as ishoped. Theever present threat
of terrorism will grow if people are
allowed to move so freely within
the twelve states of the commu-
nity. Also, some states worry that
less restricted traveling will mean
mass migrations from East Euro-
pean states. Spain, Italy, and Por-
tugal are concerned about heavy
immigration from North Africa.
According to Mr. Holmes, the other
three freedoms will occur in oil
time,

Also with regard to the EC,
Mr. Holmes emphasized a plan to
make banks across Europe. more
free to invest in others countries.
By 1993, banks who havealicense-
to do business in one country can
automatically do business in the
other eleven, Banks will operate
with little restriction, being able to
carry out insurance policies and
deal in securities. Mr. Holmes
described the plan as a “far-reach-
ing move” that will put Europe * ‘a
little bitahead of the United States”
with regard to banking. —
