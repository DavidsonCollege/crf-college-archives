THE DAVIDSONIAN,

APRIL 15, 1921.

ABEL McIVER FRASER.

The subject of this sketch was born
in Sumter, S. C., June 14, 1856. His
father was Thomas Boone Fraser, a
lawyer, a captain in the Confederate
Army, a member: in turn of each house
of the Legislature, one of the committee
of eight that rescued the State from re-
construction in 1876, and a circuit judge
for 16 years. He was also an elder in
the Presbyterian Church His mother
was Sarah Margaret McIver, of York-
ville, S.C.

He prepared for college under Mr.
McQueen, of Sumter, and in 1872 entered
Davidson. After four years of hard work
he graduated in 1876, standing high in his
class. In the fall of 1877 he entered Co-
lumbia Theological Seminary along with
five other members of his class. After
his graduation from the seminary in
May, 1880, he was called to Frankfort,
Ky., to take charge of an effort to es-
tablish a Southern Presbyterian Church
in South Frankfort, there being none
there at that time.

Being young and inexperienced, he did
not succeed so well, and after three
months of effort gave up the undertak-
ing. In January, 1881, he was called to
be pastor of a church in Fayette County,
Kentucky. In July of that year he was
married to Miss Octavia Blanding, of
Sumter, S. C., his own native town. They
have been blessed with six children, five
of whom are now living and doing well
in the professional and business world.

Dr. Fraser continued as pastor in Ken-
tucky until 1893. In January, 1893, he
was called to the pastorate of the First
Church, Staunton, Va., of which church
he has been pastor ever since. Soon
after moving to Staunton he was elected
a trustee of the Mary Baldwin Semi-
nary. In 1909, on the death of the pres-
ident of the board of trustees, he became
his successor and still holds that posi-
tion. He has also been chaplain of this
school for 24 years.

He has also served on the boards of
trustees of Hampden-Sidney and Davis
and Etkins Colleges. For over 20 years
he has been a member of Synod’s Com-
mittee of Home Missions and for many
years a member of Presbytery’s Com-
mittee of Home Missions. For several
years he has been one of the board of
trustees of the Synod’s Orphan Home.
He received the degree of D.D. in 1896
from Davidson College and the same
year from Central University in Ken-
tucky.

In 1919 he was moderator of the Gen-
eral Assembly and in 1920 attended the
Assembly in Charlotte as retiring mod-
erator, when another Davidson alumnus,
Dr. Walter L. Lingle, succeeded him.

Rev. W. E. Hudson, of Staunton, Va.,
has published a volume, “Dr. Fraser and
His Sermons,” as a tribute to Dr. Fraser,
a very unusual thing while a man is liv-
ing. The first part of the book is a
biographical sketch by Rev. W. C. White,
and six short appreciations by other
ministers. among them Dr. W. W.
Moore, who have been intimately asso-
ciated with him and have been influenc-
ed by his godly life.

The second part contains nine of Dr.
Fraser’s sermons. It was the Rev. Mr.
Hudson who conceived the preparation
of this book which, he says, he wished to
publish “as a mark of gratitude for hav-
ing his life enriched by contact with Dr.
Fraser,”
