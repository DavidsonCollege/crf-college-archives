Scholarships keep
athletics competitive

By Carrie Blackburn

Davidson’s efforts to recruit
top quality athletes are hampered
by the fact that only men’s basket-
ball players and a few women ath-
letes are offered full scholarships.

The college funds 22 full ath-
letic scholarships; 13 go to men’s
basketball, and the remaining 9 are
apportioned among the women’s
sports.

Because the college will not
increase the proportion of the fi-
nancial aid budget designated for
athletic scholarships, funds to sup-
port additional, partial athletic
scholarshipsare solicited from out-
side sources.

The Davidson Athletic Foun-
dation (DAF) raises money through
the Wildcat Club to fund all the
additional athletic grants. The
foundation relies solely on dona-
tions, mostly from alumni, because
all revenue generated from ticket
sales goes toward general upkeep.
Through fund-raisers, the DAF
establishes endowments to support
partial scholarships for various
sports.

In order to entice recruits for
sports other than basketball, the
DAF has made its “‘new mission to
raise money for the support of other
athletic scholarships,” says Ster-
ling Martin, Director of Intercolle-
giate Programs. According to
Martin, the athletic program’s goal
is 20 men’s and 20 women’s schol-
arships, in addition to the basket-

ball scholarships which already
exist.

In the mid-70s, the Board of
Trustees decided to funnel all funds
for athletic scholarships into one
sport “because we want basketball
to’ achieve regional and national
success,” says Martin.

The athletic department has
since reallocated some of its re-
sources away from men's basket-
ball towards women’s sports.

Under the mandate of Title 9,
part of a federal equal rights act,
the NCAA adopted a policy of

' genderequity. Onthe college level,

this policy translates into more
opportunities for women in sports,
Interpreting Title 9 is often con-
fusing because with sports like
football, a literal equivalent for
women is impractical and undesir-
able. According to Director of
Athletics Terry Holland, schools
are encouraged to “measure the
desires of women students” and
meet their needs.

Most schools meet the
NCAA’s minimum standards of
gender equity by apportioning their
athletic budget between men’s and
women’s sports based on the rela-
tive number of male and female
athletes. Davidson, however, bases
their apportionment on the per-
centage of men and women in the
entire student body. Holland ex-
plains, “You can not know if stu-

faculty outside of class. However,
he recognizes that this problem is
common on many campuses.
Although the Rhodes and
Davidson campuses are similar in
size, Shandley perceives a signifi-
cant difference between the two.
With a population of one million,
Memphis offers many opportuni-
ties and services that Davidson’s
4000-person community cannot
provide. Instead, the college itself
must be self-sufficient, offering
social options and counseling ser-
vices. :
Shandley. sees “a need to
broaden the type of social activi-
ties that happen at Davidson.” He
is excited about being involved in
planning for a new college union.
Students involved in the nine-
month selection process are confi-
dent in Shandley’s abilities. After
talking with Shandley during a
campus visit, sophomore Ashley
Tabb says that “he seemed really

personable, continuing the quali-
ties and policies of Dean Terry.”
Tabb also feels that Shandley’s
experience with alcohol policies
and Greek systems will benefithim
in his transition to Davidson.

Shandley has served since
1988 at Rhodes College, where he
launched campus programs di-
rected toward leadership develop-
ment and multiculturalism.
Shandley also personalized orien-
tation activities and helped design
the Campus Life Center. Rhodes
students honored Shandley by
electing him to Omicron Delta
Kappa, the national leadership fra-
ternity.

Shandley attained degrees at
Simpson College, Bowling Green
State University, and the Univer-
sity of Minnesota where he com-
pleted his Ph.D. studies in Higher
Education. Previously, Shandley
held positions at the Universities
of Minnesota and South Carolina.
He also made a brief appearance in
the 1993 film The Firm.

Graduates from the classes of '49, '50, '54, '59, ‘69, and '74 returned to reminisce with old

friends and to check out the changes at their alma mater. More than 500 alumns came to
campus.

College moves on with new Statement of Purpose

1990s continued from page 1

Statement demonstrate that the ide-
als of the Christian faith are not
incompatible with those of inclu-
siveness. Hestresses that the adop-
tion of the changes does not at-
tempt to lower Davidson’s moral
standards, but rather, incorporates

often excluded groups to make the
Statement more representative of
the college community.

Inthe fall of 1992, Craig Wall,
Chairman of the Board of the Trust-
ees, decided to appoint a commit-
tee to study the Statement of Pur-
pose after members of the faculty
and many others expressed their

belief that changes needed to be
made.

After careful research, the
committeesubmitted a proposal for
review.

The SGA then drew up a pos-
sible revision, which the commit-
tee considered before submitting
its final draft to the Board.
