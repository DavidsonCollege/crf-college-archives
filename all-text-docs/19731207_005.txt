poor dolts who are not
clammoring for the im-
peachment of the President.

I was not even upset by the
resemblence of the whole
front page presentation to my
former high school's  third-
rate plastic-hippie un-
derground newspaper (a
quote from Jim Morrison?
Come now).

However, I am not at all
sure that an article containing
common crude _ political
dogmatism belongs on the
front page of a paper
published by a group of (sup-
posedly) sensitive,
sophisticated, well-educated
liberal arts students.

Perhaps you should ‘‘render
unto Caeser that which is
Caeser’s’’ and leave the
enralr commentary to bet-

-trained people who show
an understanding of the
issues.

At any rate you should cast
your pearls in a more ap-
propriate pigsty.

To the Editor:
For the past four years, I
during

the end of each term to fill out
a faculty evaluation form. I
have done so gladly. However,
this same four year
period, [have never seen any
efficacy from doing so.

letter: to make inquiries con-
cerning the results of these
surveys

If the faculty is truly to be
evaluated, it is my opinion
that the results of these sur-
veys should be made
available to the students. Not
only will this aid the student in
the selection of courses, it. will

Is this just? Those faculty
members who are_ confident
that they do a good job should
encourage disclosure as
evaluation will support them
and give to them the

jective and effective
evaluation upon their
disclosure. But what are the
chances for such disclosure?
Unfortunately, Davidson is
controlled by a political

quo”’.

But do we as_ students
desire such conservatism?
Do we desire traditional and
antiquated pedagogy and its
concomitant conservative
politics or do we desire change

as being fundamental to:

refusal by the Nixon Ad-
ministration to make
available certain materials
that might be incriminating to
it.

Thus, it would seem that the
refusal to disclose these
materials is tantamount to a
confession that there is

to hide’’. Cer-
tainly, if there was nothing to
hide, the tapes would long ago
have been released.

To follow up on _ this
metaphor (which I am sure is
considered by many to be an
outrageous parallel): It is my
opinion that it would be in the
college interest if the results
of the evaluation surveys were
released. If not, we will be left
no alternative but to assume
that those who would benefit

Stone, P.E. Program Blasted

To the Editor:

It is not my usual in-
clination to complain, but I
feel that something must be
said about the present
situation with regards to both
the gymnasium and the
physical education depart-
ment.

To begin with, the present
facilities at Johnston Gym are
woefully inadequate for the
— that it ac-

Cothe press
present situation is an
one.

In the meantime, however,
something must be done about
the efficiency that rules the
physical education depart-
ment. It appears that the
people involved here are com-
pletely unconcerned about

situation should not be
tolerated.

I see no reason why the
locker room should be closed
upatall.

P.E. requirements need to
be reconsidered.

There should at least be
some credit given for par-
ticipation in intramurals. The
possibilities for im-
provement are there.

People just need to get off
their ass and do something
about them.

To the Editor:

The availability of Johnston —

Gym - locker room, basketball
courts, etc. - to the average
Davidson student is beyond
reproach.

The locker room is never
open on weekends, a condition
of which very few students are
aware; yet this condition of
secrecy exists throughout the
Johnston Gym heirarchy.
(Who is Chip Stone, anyway?
Does he exist? )

What good is a locker room
for equipment if it is not going
to be open?

The administration cries
lack of personnel, yet I applied
for financial aid in the form of
work-study and was rejected.

Surely our brilliant
organization of ‘‘top-flite’’ ad-
ministrators could solve such
an insignificant problem.

And finally, intramural
games are being cancelled
for girl’s basketball practice
(cries of male chauvinism! ).
Look at the situation in the

If every Davidson student
was treated as an individual,
regardiess of sex, the op
timum use of Johnston Gym
(our only resource) would oc-
cur when the greatest number
of individuals benefitted from
the use of the court, (Indirect
externalities must be om-
mitted).

My own analysis shows that
during Intramural games ap-
proximately 32 people per
hour directly benefit from the
use of the gym. (Calculations
are: two games per hour each
involving two teams, each
averaging around eight per-
sons. )

Can any other organization
presently using the gym
claim such intensive use?

In all seriousness, this is
not a request for an
elimination for any of our

cooperation
various

My own suggestion is
schedule posted vaiaminat-
vance giving times of prac-
eee ™
free

Hopefully, something can be
done, and though I may never
again be able to have a date
from this campus as a result
of my alleged chauvinism,
perhaps I may be able to play
basketball onee in a while.

P.S.: Nixon is a liar and a
crook.
