To Div. II or not to Div. III,
_ That is the question

Since we arrived here in late August,
Davidson has been receiving all kinds of na-
tional media attention.

Kaplan cited the school as one of a dozen
“hot” colleges nationwide, US World News
and Report ranked Davidson the 9" best lib-
eral arts school in the country and USA Today
awarded this fine institution an NCAA Aca-
demic Achievement Award.

And then, in the most recent edition of
Sports Illustrated, Davidson was named 195"
best sports college in America, just behind
such powerhouses as George Mason and Idaho
State.

. There are only 324 Division I schools in the

country, which means that Davidson falls in

roughly the 60" percentile (that’s right—be-
low average, people).

Every single Ivy League school was ranked
ahead of us, and four Southern Conference
members are considered better sports colleges
than Davidson.

To add insult to injury, our caption in the
magazine read: “Basketball made NCAAs;
25% of 1,672
undergrads on var-
sity teams; high-
SAT student body
taunts foes: ‘we’re
not stupid!’”

Please don’t tell
me people at
Davidson actually
use that cheer. Ev-
erybody knows that
students here are
very smart, but
chanting ‘we aren’t stu-pid’ is like Mike Tyson
proclaiming, “I’m not sta-ble.”

Speaking of smart, Davidson does share the
highest graduation rate for athletes with Rice
University. Rice, however, is the.45" best
sports college, 150 places ahead of us.

Look, everyone loves the fact that little ole
Davidson is a Division I school and from time

.to time our teams make a splash on the na-
tional level (e.g: Men’s basketball last year
and men’s soccer this season).

But when was the last time Davidson won a
national championship?

Our athletics website reads, “ In the past
two decades Davidson has participated in the
NCAA Division 1 Men’s Basketball Champi-
onship, Men’s Soccer Championship and
Women’s Volleyball Championship, plus has
won a national championship in women’s
tennis.”

Past two decades? Come on. That’s like
saying your wife was attractive 20 years ago.

Furthermore, the aforementioned national
championship is the only one in Davidson’s
165-year history and was won in 1984 (before
many freshmen were even born) at the Divi-
sion III level.

Andas a small Division I school, Davidson
doesn’t stand out as much as we all like to
think. College of the Holy Cross, the 26" best
liberal arts school with an undergraduate en-
rollment under 2,800, is ranked 197" by Sports
Illustrated and boasts a 90% graduation rate.

All the other top-10 liberal arts schools in

America (and the top 25 for that matter) are ~

Davidson athletics have

the potential to be a domi-
nant force nationally, just
not at the Division I level.

Division III members, and most do exception-
ally well at that level.

Williams College, the 2nd ranked liberal
arts school in America, was named best divi-
sion II sports school by Sports Illustrated:
“By the end of [last] school year Williams had
won three D-III national titles, its 31 teams had
gone 595-50-1 and... Williams earned its sixth
NCAA Division III all-sports trophy in seven
years.”

The similarities between Davidson and Wil-
liams are many, especially in the academic
arena. Athletically, however, Williams is win-
ning championships, whereas most Davidson
teams barely stay afloat in the Southern Con-
ference.

’ Last year alone, only two Davidson teams
finished SoCon play in the top three (men’s
soccer and basketball), and just six of 16 teams
wound up in the top half.

Davidson’s combined record for the 14 teams
that kept win/loss records for the 2001-2002
year was 134-180 (.427).

Men’s teams put together a 72-87 (.453)
record, while the
women finished at
62-93 (.400).

Translation:
Davidson teams lose
more than they win.

Division Ill
schools are allowed
tohave botha men’s
and women’s team
compete at the Di-
vision I level, such
as Colorado College
with men’s ice hockey and women’s soccer.

Hypothetically. speaking, should Davidson
switch to Division III, either the men’s basket-
ball or soccer team should retain their Division
I status (although many other programs are
certainly on the rise), and on the women’s side
several teams could make a strong case to do
the same.

Many people will argue that student-ath-
letes come here to compete against the best of
the best, and I agree that fora lot of athletes this
may be the case.

At the same time, however, the word “‘com-
pete” seems to take on a whole new meaning.

Last year, the baseball team lost to #4 South
Carolina 15-0, and most recently the field
hockey team dropped a 12-0 decision to #13
Duke.

Not much competition going on there.

This is not to say that our athletes can’t
compete at the Division I level. And trust me,
Ihave the utmost respect for anyone that wears
the Davidson red and black.

‘My pointis, though, thatit may be beneficial
for Davidson, both athletically and on the
whole, to compete for a national champion-
ship on a consistent basis, and not just once
every two or three decades. .

After all, isn’ tit time that the 1984 women’s
tennis team becomes a thing of the past?

Davidson athletics has the potential to be a
dominant force pabonally, just not at the Divi-
sion I level.

Sure, our teams win about half their games,
but the school’s attractiveness would increase

exponentially if some teams were taking home
national championships each year.

This isn’t little league anymore. Although
playing for the love of the game is still impor-
tant, college sports put slightly more emphasis
on winning. Not everyone gets to play, and
there isn’t always ice cream afterwards.

Davidson needs to put itself in a position to
win games, and not just 40% of them. Will-
iams won 92% of its athletic contests last year,
a remarkable accomplishment at any level.

And if Davidson would switch to Division —
III, our teams would be just as successful.
