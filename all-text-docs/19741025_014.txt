At this last meeting, Chip
Stone made the gutsy decisior.
of no beet allowed during
Flickerball games. It oc-
curred to me that Chip could
not have been the driving
force behind this decision. Af-
ter all, when was the last time
you saw Chip Stone at a flick-
erball game? When was the
last time you saw Chip Stone?
When was the first time? The
point is that as is the case with
most IMAC affairs, Chip:
doesn’t really care. I had a
hunch that perhaps this decis-
ion originated from the desk '
of College President Samuel '
R. Spencer Jr. After all, all
roads lead to Rome. So, I con-
ferred with my administrative
contact, Herbie Klondike.

‘Herbie, did the president
have anything to do with the
beer decision?’ I asked.

“The President admits
having no prior knowledge of,

its to having partaken
in the actual decision con-
cerning the beer.

“The president,’”’ continued
Klondike, ‘“‘has a deep love for
the students and even a
greater love for beer here at
Davidson.” ©

‘Are you sure the president
had nothing to do with the
decision?” I asked. |

‘Well, actually he did,” said ,

Herbie, “but it being a con-
troversial decision and all, we
thought it best to keep the
president out of it. After all,
he’s busy with plans for his, I
mean the school’s, new radio
station.”

“I was wondering what the
nee behind the decision

feel that beer during flicker-

leads to venereal disease and '
héroin addiction,” said Klon-
dike.

“I didn’t know flickerball

Isaid.

‘Well, originally it wasn’t,”
said Klondike, ‘‘but the

“Do you think that the no
beer decision will in the long
run benefit the students?” I
wondered out loud.

“The students, what stu- |
dents? Oh, you mean the stud-
;ents here. "The hell with them.
Since when do we make decis- -
ions around here to appease
the students? We thought that
the no beer decision would
enhance our Presbyterian ap-
pearance. This would en-
able us to get more
money from our alumni,
which in turn helps us to ex-
pand our services to students
\and the community through
projects like slum housing,’
Klondike reminded me.

“TI never realized that all
that malt deprived the college

of the ability to get funds,”’ I
added. _

“‘Most of the students don’t
realize it either,”’ replied Her-

bie. ‘‘But we’re gonna give the -

students a chance to make
back the money they’ve' |
for us. Remember those ni
seats you students used to oce-
upy at the Coliseum

, this

al the rich alumni. Of course
the team may lose the home
court advantage, but, at least,
we'll be in the black: again
this year.”’

‘I’ve got an even better
idea,’’ I offered. ‘Why don’t

race. Rick Deal, Bob Lauten-
sack and Jeff Neikirk finished
together for third place..

The final scores were David-
son 24, Campbell 32, and
Davidson 18, Gardner Webb
42.

The following Monday found
the Wildcats in
Virginia competing against
old rivals VMI and
Washington and Lee. Their
performance over that
treacherous mountain course
must rate as one of the most
outstanding races ever run by
a Davidson team.

In this competition Pin-
ckney finished first again for a
total of five consecutive wins.

While in Virginia the Wild-
cats thrashed the W&L
Generals 24-35, and the VMI
Pirates 23-35. A double victory
over -these opponents is un-
matched in recent memory.

Head Coach Sterling Martin
“Coty was'
super for us as usual. Fresh-
man Bill McClement’s. run-
ning secorid is extremely en-
couraging for the future. Jesse
Smith,“_Deal, Neikirk and
Lauteiisack came in again
together and we were able to
offset Bell’s absence.

On Saturday, Oct. 19, the
Wildcats overwhelmed St. An-
drews and Pembroke’s B-
Team at Laurinburg. Pin-
ckney, McClement, Lauten-
sack and Smith made the
scorer see red in the first fow
places. Bell and Deal com

‘and 8th places respectively.

At Davidson’s 5-way meet
on Monday, Oct. 21, the Wild-
cats placed second only to
Pembroke. Davidson over-
came Wake Forest, High
Point, and Appalachian B.. |

Pinckney, at 32:00 for six’
miles missed his sixth con-
secutive win by two seconds to
Pembroke’s Marion Grad-
dock. The next Cat over the
finish line was McClement at
33:42 in tenth place. He was,
followed by Smith ‘and Lauten-'
sack and Neikirk ’ finished
18th at 34:17.

The biggest remaining
challenge for the Harriers at
this point is to avoid injuries in
their last two regular season
meets as they compete for the
