Athletic Policy Facing Crossroads?

Where there’s smoke, goes the old
adage, there is usually more than a
little bit of flame. In recent. days
clouds of smoke have rolled from
the direction of Davidson’s athletic
department.

According to Sports Editor Hamil-
ton’s story (Page One), alumni ath-
letic boosters, under the leadership
of a new “Wildcat Club” hierarchy,
are laying plans for a determined
push for more athletic grants for the
Davidson program. At this point, no
one is sure just how much they want
or how they intend to go about get-
ting it. One thing is certain, they will
try for increased funds.

On “The Hill.” the grind of knives
can be heard as faculty opponents of
subsidized athletics prepare for an-
other round of what has thus far been
a losing ‘battle. If current plans go
according to schedule,’ the Board of
Trustees will settle the matter, for
the time being, at’its February meet-
ing.

After talking with Coach Bill Dole
several weeks ago, we can easily un-

Voting Proposals To Crush Apathy

Davidson's traditional apathetic
elections cannot be entirely blamed
on a lack of student interest. Much of
the trouble lies with the outmoded
election methods which cause the vot-
ing period to string out for weeks,
and with poor luck, months.

Something must be done now
about this system if the old bugaboo
of student apathy is to be conquered.

In a Wednesday interview Stu-
dent Body President John Kuyken-
dall talked of minor changes. In gen-
eral, we agree with his suggestions,
but they scarcely go far enough. For
the Council’s consideration, we would
like to present the following propos-
als: .

(i) The election of the editors of
Davidson's three publications should
be held at the same time as the elec-
tions for Student Body officers. A
conflict here is highly improbable. If
that circumstance should occur, spe-
cial provision could be made for that
particular. year. As a rule, there is
no reason why these votes could not
be held at the same time.

(2) YMCA elections should be con-
ducted by the “‘Y” and removed from
the Student’ Body election system.
The logic for this move should be

derstand the motivation behind this
drive for new schorlarships. At that
time, Coach Dole explained quite
frankly that under present condi-
tions, it was growing well nigh impos-
sible for Davidson to compete with
any degree of reasonable success in
the Southern Conference. The pres-
ent alumni attempt for increased aid
for Davidson’s athletic fortunes is
their answer to this problem, now
reaching the critical stage.

There are other obvious answers.
This is the one that advocates of a
strong athletic program will propose.

Perhaps controversy over an increase °

in athletic grants will cause a

thorough analysis of Davidson’s en- |

tire athletic policy.

At any rate, future developments
will, bear careful attention by alb
genuinely interested in Davidson and
her future. Perhaps it would be too
much to say that a decision by the
Trustees in this matter will mark a
turning point; it will most certainly
indicate a direction for the years to
come.

evident. The YMCA is not an official
organization of the Student Body, and
not all members of the Student Body
are members of the “Y". Why then
should its elections crowd the already
heavy election schedule?

(3) No separate elections should
be held for class presidents. All
classes should vote for Student Coun-
cil representatives, and the represent-
ative who receives the highest vote
total should be automatically desig-
nated president. As class presidents
are members of the Council, it is
assumed that the same qualifications
are required for Council representa-
tive as class president.

(4) The Athletic Council, tradition-
ally elected last, should be appointed
by the Student Council.

(5) Head Cheerleader should be
either appointed. by the Council or
elected at the same time as Student
Body officers and publication editors.

The DAVIDSONIAN believes that
all of these proposals are both rea-
sonable and practical. Details will
have to be worked out by the Coun-
cil and President John, but if they
are adopted. we feel that the only
result can be speedier and more in-
teresting elections.

Ease Exam Schedule Policy

The forthcoming examination
week will elicit many moans from the
students about their exam schedule.
For some it will be that their toughest
two fall on the same day; some will
cry that they could be through with
exams after the first three or four
days if they didn't have to wait until
the last day for R.O.T.C.

The DAVIDSONIAN would like to
enter a plea for a more lenient policy
on the part of the administration for
examination schedules.

As it stands now, there is little
a student can do except take this
exam when the period of his class
falls. In freshman and sophomore
courses particularly, where courses
are taught in several sections, many
students would welcome the oppor-

tunity to take the exam with another
section of the same course. Why not
relax the stipulation requiring a stu-
dent to take the exam with his sec-
tion?

A rather radical proposal which
has its merits would be for a profes-

sor to place the name of each siu-
dent on a copy of the exam, and let
the students pick up the tests and
leave their finished exams at a desig-
nated point any time during the
examination period. (This method
might be more regulated by each pro-
fessor setting aside only a portion of
the exam period during which the
student might take the exam.)

A student, given the opportunity
to take an exam when he feels he is
best prepared,’ will be under less
tension, and a truer picture of each
individual’s abilities can be gained
when each has had the benefit of
adequate preparation.

Almost any proposal will present
problems, and many suggestions
which students make will include
points which conflict with other
ideas. The DAVIDSONIAN suggests
a student-faculty. committee be set up
to accept ideas and study possible
methods of altering the examination
schedule system, with an eye toward
making it easier for the student to
consolidate a semester’s work
throughly and demonstrate his ca-
pabilities at fheir best—G.W.R.

KREMLIN ULTIMATUM

Free World Must Meet Communist Challenge in Berlin

By ED ARMFIELD

The Eisenhower Administra-
tion is to be commended for
taking a strong position against
the Russian ultimatum that we
withdraw from Berlin within
six months. The criticism of
the past that the administration
of the “Captive Hero” has been
characterized by the absence
of firm decisions is not now of
primary importance.

The fact is that the United
States. under the leadership of
a proven military genius, has
made a sound decision, both
militarily and politically.

The experience of our na
tion with the principle of ap-
peasement during our life-
times has been all but pleas-
ant.

World War II resulted
after unsuccessful attempts to
appease Hitler in the ‘thirties.
The attempts to avoid warfare
by bargaining away principles
proved to be only futile pipe
dreams after Munich in 1938,
when the Czech Sudetanland
was turned over to Nazi domi-
nation.

LETTERS TO EDITOR

Correspondents Hit
Mud, Library Noise

Dear Editor:

Though I would not at all
pretend to criticize the weather
at this most glorious of edu-
cational institutions, it is nev-
ertheless true that for some
reason Davidson has a quite
generous supply of mud. As a

“matter of fact, I have unearthed

a fabulous deposit of it between
Duke dorm and: the Union:
enough, I believe, to supply
Helena Rubinstein for twenty
years.

Unfortunately, right through
the center of this, there is and
has been for many’ years a
pathy from Duke to the general
vicinity of the Union; a path
which supports a volume of
traffic sufficient to make U. S.
No. 1 look like a squirrel track
by comparison. By some acci-
dent it seems to have escaped
the notice of the administration
that this veritable highway is
unpaved.

Having grown fearful of the
homicidal glances of my jani-
tor whenever I would bring
half this path into the dorm
on my shoes, I decided to in-
quire as to the reason for the
rustic nature of said thorough-
fare. I was informed gently but
ever so politely that “You

Dear Editor:

For some reason Davidson
students are hesitant to tell
each other to be quiet in the
library. Whether that is a
weakness or a virtue, it is a
fact. They do, however, report
the inednvenience to the li-
brary staff. Since the reports
have become fairly numerous,
we are adopting this method,
and the “reminder signs” in
the stacks, to call the condi-
tion to the attention of the
student body.

A major disturbance seems
to be talking in the carrel area.
We had hoped to remedy this
difficulty by eliminating the
halls beside the carrels and by
making them more private.
Without your consideration,
architectural improvement will
go for little.

The Library Committee has
voted that there will be no
conducted tours through the
Library. We are proud of the
building and would like to
show it off, but its primary
purpose is study. Conducted
“tours” are defined as groups
of three or more persons. Stu-

proposed new dorm, would
you?” However, since it now
appears that the new dorm is
to be behind Belk, I heartily
agree that such a path would
be somewhat of a detour.

I once heard a prominent
lady on campus suggest that
the whole campus be paved and
painted green. I am totally op-
posed to this, however, as it
would frustrate future Fresh-
man classes to have no grass
not to walk on. I wish, though,

that someone would at least

put some gravel on that path.

parents through at any time,
with due consideration for oth-
ers at work.

The doors to the large read-
ing rooms were added to cut
down the noise from the main
lobby and the stairs.

We believe we have done
everything possible to make
the library a convenient place
to study short of acting as
policeman. The dormitories
weren't designed primarily for
study. The Library is. It’s up
to you.

ultimatum from the Krenv
lin to withdraw from Berlin.
There are those who contend
that Berlin is not worth the
risk of o nuclear war. But
there is then the question:
Will Soviet demands end at
Berlin? Histery says no. The
Communist Manifesto which
calls for the “forcible over:
throw of all existing social
conditions seconds this ans-
wer.

Demands of this nature which
are met will be followed by
more ultimatums until, as an
end result, we will be forced

and strong support of prin

The allied system of regional
alliances is the only force ca-
pable of putting an end to So-
viet imperialism. Only through
a unified stand, and not
through the unsuccessful prin-
ciple of appeasement can we
maintain a balance of power
with the Soviet.

Burden Too Great 24a

By JOHN TOUMARAS

During the past few years.there has been much dis-
cussion concerning Davidson’s curriculum. Most of this
discussion has revolved around the advantages and dis-
advantages of adding new courses and of modifying basic

courses. ©

Although many improvements have been made, one
basic problem or question remains to be answered. Sup-
pose hundreds of new courses are added and basic ones
are revitalized, when would a student have the time to

take them?

At present, one must have 124 hours and a like num-
ber of quality points in order to graduate. Of these 124
hours, 64 are required hours in basic freshman and sopho-
more courses of English, Bible, history, science, math, for-
eign language, and ROTC. Add to this 36 hours consumed
by a major and a minor and 12 hours of Advanced ROTC
and you have a grand total of 112 hours. Thus a student
is given the opportunity to choose 12 hours of electives
at his own discretion. Is this a liberal education?

One need not question the importance of most of
the basic, required courses, although improvements in
the subject material covered and teaching methods can.
always be made. Bible and ROTC, however, allow for

some changes.

It seems to me that an adequate knowledge of the .
Bible can be taught in two semesters instead of four
if less time were spent in memorizing kings and in ex-
plaining the first few chapters of Genesis.

No credit should be given for ROTC, especially the
Advanced courses. Since a cadet is paid for two years
of ROTC and is rewarded for his efforts wfth an Army
commission, no other compensation need or ought to be
made. If such a policy were pursued, a student would
have 18 more hours of electives to choose at his discre-
tion. Would this not make for a more liberal education?

THE PHILOSOPHES

The new Dana Laboratories
is climbing impressively from
its foundation. Its growth may
be. rendering us insensible to
the threat which the acclaim it
receives symbolizes for the
balance and breadth of liberal
arts education at Davidson.

OBVIOUS FACT

About the most obvious fact
of our present life as a college
is our commitment to expan-
sion. The increasing popularity
of the pre-medical major (they
constitute almost 30% of the
present senior class) coupled
with the designated gift of Mr.
Dana and recent losses in facul-
ty strength, as in the history
and psychology departments,
make greater the temptation to
overbalance one phase of the
expansion.

A larger college of 1000 stu-
dents with high academic stan-
dards and of high integrity can
be realized at Davidson only
through the combined and co-
ordinated growth of all aspects
of the institution.

One possible principle for
guidance during such growth
is the fact that the emphases,
objects, and methods of teach-
ing of arts and natural sciences
are quite different. An increase
in the physical plant which
would be of great benefit to
one might not appreciably af-
fect the progress of the other.
The nature of the subject mat-
ter creates the essential distinc-
tive qualities of the arts: man

with his aspirations and _ fail-

ures is vitally involved and can-

not easily be made to fit gen-

eral and universal laws.
CLASS SIZE

The size of the class needs
to be smaller and the professor-
student ratio more favorable.
The relation of student with
professor needs to be stressed
to communicate that portion of
a body of knowledge which
logic is unable to do.

Class discussion and seminar
work are iniportant; interde-
partmental study should com-
plete the work of the arts ma-
jor, for the subject with which
he deals cannot be confined in
any one field.

RELATED

Another possible guiding
principle for expansion is the
concept that the arts and na-
tural sciences are related and
both contained within a com-
plete intellectual and moral ed-
ucation. This is uniquely true
at Davidson. The increase in
physical facilities for natural
science is likely to continue
the trend towards pre-medical
work rather than some sort of
pre-research major.

The nature of the experience
of the doctor demands a great
deal more than a knowledge of
instruments, chemistry, and
biology; he deals with people
as people as well as with peo-
ple as functional organisms. Ac-
ting upon such a principle, the
institution would give the liber-
al arts major a grounding in at
least the basic theory of na-
tural science and would estab-
lish the encounter of the pre-
medical student with the chal- |
lenge of the arts and the study
of man as man.

Such guiding principles, if
valid, would demand an organic
and natural expansion of every
phase of the total college spec
trum and a corresponding syn-
thesis of the whole. They would
say that, if we must grow, we
grow with wisdom.
