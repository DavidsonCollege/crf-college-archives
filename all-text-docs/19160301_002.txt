EXAMINATIONS.

Final examinations at the end of the
Fall and Spring terms area constant
source of dread to the student—good,
bad and indifferent. ‘To the first, be-
cause he fears that he will forget some
little detail, unessential possibly, but nec-
essary for the 98 or 99 for which he is
trying; to the second, because of the al-
most certain failure which the exam will
only emphasize, and to the third, because
of the necessity for many hours of ‘“cram-
ming.” Because of the important place
which these two final tests of the year
hold, it would seem that we should se-
cure as much good from them as posst-
ble, for certainly that must be the pur-
pose of a real cxamination—to require
the student to do better work.

As long as we have known of the cam-
pus feeling here in Davidson, there has
been the repeated and constantly increas-
ing desire on the part of practically all
the students that we have some system by
which faithful work throughout the year
will be rewarded in a tangible way. If
-daily recitation grades and regular tests
show that a man has been successful in
his work, is it not fair that he should be
excused from the final examination? A
reward of this kind would be a constant

incentive to every student to do faithful | -

daily work and form habits of regular
study and thought which will be worth
much in after life,

This system has found favor in many
of the leading institutions throughout
the country, and we feel that with the
very close supervision which is found at
Davidson as to the term work, that some
plan might be found which would be
workable here. There is certainly no
doubt on the part of the students as to
the desire for something of the kind, and
the expression of individual members of
the Faculty has shown that if good can
be secured from some olan of this kind.
that they would favor it.

We thoroughly believe that a much
larger percentage of the students would
do more faithful, consistent work and

that the students who gain the coveted

tests.

MORE ALUMNI ASSOCIATIONS.

Quite often we get word of some new
group of Davidson men who have gotten

ciation. More often we hear from some
individual student in a community who
says that he is sure that he is one of many
who would like to be in such an associa-
tion, but that they have not been able to
“vet together.”

‘There seems to be an opportunity here
for a number of men to do the college a
service and to get much pleasure for
themselves, by organizing the alumni in
their immediate territory and getting
them together at regular intervals. THE
Davipsonian will be glad to furnish in-
formation regarding the plans which
have been made by various associations
and methods by which the most good can
he secured from them. One notable ex-
ample of a live association is the Atlanta
group, who meet at lunch once each
month, and they are constantly reporting
many good things.

WITH OTHER COLLEGES.

New Exchanges—With the addition
to the exchanges of ‘He Davipsonian
of two new college weeklies, “he New
Hampshire,” of Durham, N. H., and
“Reed College Quest,” of Portland,
Ore., the exchange editor realizes an
ideal—an exchange list reaching from the
Atlantic to the Pacific. “lhe faculty of
Reed College has adopted a constitu-
tion. “One of the most striking features
of the new constitution is the creation
of a Welfare Committee to serve as a
connecting link between the faculty and
trustees, The committee is composed of
two members of the Board of Trustees,
two members of the faculty and the pres-
ident of the college, who is ex-officio
chairman of the committee.”
