GETTING ACQUAINTED
New Chaplain Checks THE DAVIDSONIAN For News

Scott Woodmansee
Assumes Chaplaincy

By FRANKLIN ANDERSON
Staff Writer

“IT want to be open,” said the
new Davidson College chaplain..
the Rev. Scott Woodmansee. ‘‘I
come as an ordained minister,
but the Christain faith allows a
lot of freedom.” .

Woodmansee continued. “1
would like to be constantly in
dialogue w:th feelings of indif-
ference and hostility.”

A Davidson graduate in the
Class of ‘59, Woodmansee comes
to Davidson from a Presbyterian
church in Collierville, Tenn.. a
suburb of Memphis.

Although he was scheduled to
arrive a month ago, he was de-

Asked about his plans. the new
chaplain would not ‘venture any
guess as to what I'd want to
initiate." However, he said he
thought that the possibilities for
small group discussion and
Christian activity in the com
munity were ‘‘very exciting.”

Noting that WII Terry, the
past chaplain. is now pastor of
the college church, Woodmansee
said that there would in effect
be two chaplains.

Mooty's candidacy was ap-

of the Publications Board.

The Student Council Monday
night decided to explore the pos-
sibility of altering the restricticn

.on scholarship holders to have

automobiles on campus.

Stating that ‘‘Realistically.
cars are no longer considered a
luxury here at Davidson,” Mike
Powell, chairman of the com-
mittee investigating the pro-
blem, voiced the council's dis-
approval of the car restrictions.

The present position of the
administration is that if a stu-
dent has financial need, then
he could not afford to keep an
automobile.

H, Edmunds White, admis-
sions director, stated that “the
cost of the automobile is not
the greatest burden, while the
‘asurance and upkeep greatly
enter into the problem."

The council felt that this is a
problem not generally recogniz-
ed by the student body. By
means of an Open End some
time in the future, possibly with
White debating either a profes-
sor or a student, the problem
could be brought ‘nto the open.

At present the admissions de-
partment makes no distinction
between the make or model of
the cars. However, White did
note that Dana scholars show-
ing good cause for having a car,
such as a job, could receive a
nominal $100 Dana stipend and
keep the car.

Concerning the ‘‘make or
model"’ area, White said that
the administration did not wish
to get into the used car busi-
ness” and therefore, in the eyes
of the administraticn, a 1956
Compact would be just as great
an expense as a 1966 Sports car.
car.

Council President Chuck Mat-
thews said that the council
would be willing to handle the
judging of cars, “but it would
be much better to have the

‘lftaculty or administraticn han-

dle it, to eliminate possible

iicharges of favoritism."

Davidsonian Calls Off
Study Funds Campaign

THE DAVIDSONIAN is call-
ing off. its drive to raise funds
for the Student Curriculum Re-
vision Committee. Drive Chair-
man Bob Travers announced
Friday.

Travers stated that since the
Faculty Revision Committee has
decided to include two student
members, the student commit-
tee may dissolve, and in any
event will not need the funds
which would have been raised.

The drive, which began Mca-
day, was to raise enough money
for the Student Committee to
prepare a report on curriculum
revision to parallel the faculty's
report.

The money would have been
used by the committee to travel
to other colleges and universities
in order to examine other cur-
ricula and to bring speakers fa-
miliar with the area of curric-
ulum reform to the campus.

All meney which has been col-

lected already will be returned .

by the canvassers.

“Since the drive was still in
progress when we decided to
call it off,"' Travers reported.
“we don't know what percent-
age of the student body partici-
pated.

“However, our canvassers re-
ported a great deal of interest
on the part of students.” Two
canvassers reported 100 per cent
favorable response from the stu-
denis they had contacted.

‘We appreciate the interest of

‘the students who contributed,”

Travers added, ‘but since there
will be two student members of

the ‘Blue Sky’ Committee the view on curriculum revision to
purpose of the drive which was be formalized in a report has
to enable the student point of been accomplished.”
