Each. student who comes to
the games will be issued a ticket so

_ the ticketing office can tabulate

the number of people in attendance,
but students do not have to sit in
the seats they are assigned. They
can sit anywhere in the student
section; which surrounds the
visitor’ s bench and consists of most
of section 1 and sections 2, 4, 6,
and 8.

He continued to say that there
will be things for people to wave,
and that 24 seats will be reserved
as a contest area.

These seats will be rotated
among the fraternities and eating
houses, and they will be judged as
to which group can do “the best
job.” The winner will receive a
substantial prize.

Faculty and staff can also get
tickets two days prior to the game;
however, unlike the students, fac-
ulty and staff must sit in their as-
signed seats.

Students that come to a cer-
tain number of games will be put
into a raffle that will take place at
a post-season banquet, and the
winner of the raffle will geta USAir
round-trip ticket.

In addition, two people will
have an opportunity to shoot for a
car. The participants will be given
30 seconds to make a lay up, free
throw, 3-pointer, and half-court
shot. “You can’t miss too many,
but itis definitely doable,” Sargent
said about the. contest.

Both Sargent and men’s bas-
ketball coach Bob McKillop said
they were very pleased with the
enthusiasm and noise level of the
fans during Saturday’s game
against Catholic, the first test of

these new policies.

Also, a Vinnie’s pretzel stand
anda pizza vendor have been added
to the Subway stand to help in-
crease the variety of food available
at the games. Sargent added that if
anyone had suggestions as to things
they wanted to see done at the
games that they. should tell him,
and he would try to accommodate
as long as the ideas weren’t terri-
bly expensive.

“We hope the kids havea great
time at the games,” Sargent said.
“We know both teams are good,
and you hope that you have an
advantage in your home games.
I’d like to congratulate the. stu-
dents so far for the men’s and
women’s teams.

The games, even over break,
have been well attended and sup-
port has been good. The main thing
is if the teams keep going like they
are people should want to come.”

Sargent also wanted to remind
all students not to park in the Baker
lot in the afternoons of Dec. 9th
and 16th to help make room for the
expected influx of fans for the bas-
ketball games on those days, in-
cluding this Saturday’s match up
against N.C. State.

“We are not trying to be threat-
ening,” he said. “We’re just asking
for help.” :

Sargent is also working on a
plan that would bring the U.S.
men’s and women’s Olympic soc-
cer teams to Richardson Field for a
double-header on March 16th.

He said that he had a 90 per-
cent commitment from the US.
Soccer Federation for the games
and hoped final word on the games
would come this week.

known person in the job, and one
said Murphy’s not being known
across the country was an advan-
tage.

“Terry Holland was great for
Davidson,” student member Shan-
non Lowrance said. “But we’ve
had our great, national recogni-
tion. Now, we need somebody to
keep Davidson athletics going. We
have a tough enough time getting
fans to basketball games; we don’t
need people in California rooting
for us. .. . We were looking for
somebody to come in and be a
normal, low-key guy.”

The persistent murmuring
from parts’of the faculty and ad-

ministration about Davidson drop- -

ping from Division I to Division
III also undoubtedly played a role
in Murphy’s selection. College
officials have said consistently that
there are no plans or ambitions to
drop to Division III, and Murphy
himself stressed that Davidson
could succeed at its current level.

“T think [Monday] night’s bas-
ketball game [an 84-83 overtime
win against Mississippi] proved
Davidson can compete and suc-
ceed at the Division I level,”
Murphy said. “Davidson should
take pride in the fact that it has
always overachieved. I know I take
great pride in that fact.”

One source said that Shupe
was the only one of the three final-
ists who said Davidson could do
well at Division III, but Murphy
apparently told the committee that
dropping to the lower level would
not really save any money, one of
the main arguments of those advo-
cating the shift.

Murphy said he had no plans
for immediate changes, which
pleased committee members and
other groups that met with and
evaluated the finalists.

“Instead of changing
Davidson, he wanted to change
into Davidson, which made all of
us happy,” Lowrance said.

After earning his economics
degree from Davidson, where he
played baseball and football his
freshman year, Murphy earned a
master’s degree in management
from Georgia Tech in ‘79, worked
at an Atlanta accounting firm until
“85 when he joined the Yellow
Jackets.

The search committee met just
before Thanksgiving to review and
discuss evaluations and reports
from other campus groups who
talked with each of the finalists.

Monday, Kuykendall called
Murphy to offer him the job and,
after discussing it briefly with his
wife and 11-year-old son, Murphy
called back Monday night to ac-
cept the position. ~

Lowrance said that after ini-
tial discussions, Murphy was the
unanimous choice.
