” Express Gratitude For Aid
Given By Church

Joseph B. Johnston, superintend-
eat of the Barium Springs Orphans’
Home spoke on the annual Thanks-
giving offering for the home last
Sunday afternoon at the Second
Presbyterian Church of Charlotte.

Following Mr. Johnston’s address
was another by David Ovens, mem-
per of the Mecklenburg Presby-
tery’s committee in charge of the
special offering. TT

Mr. Johnston expressed his grat-
itude to the synod for having last
year raised the institution out of
debt with their contributions, This,
hgwever, hag made it more diffi-
cult to meet the current needs of
the Home. The Thanksgiving of-
fering, which totals about half the
yearly budget, ought not to fall
below the $51,000 seceived last
year, he declared, .

Mr. Ovens stated that, with oth-
er agencies taking over the greater
part of reli¢f work, the church
needs just such an outlet as this to
express the: Spirit of Christ. He
pointed out that—the-erphanage

needs of the 300 children it in-
cludes, but is giving them new
hope, new courage, and a sense of
security. —_

The “D" Club, prominent varsity

formally taken into the council next
week.
; The" D" Clubbers considered this
invitation during their last meeting,

Promotion of PeaceIs

Gwyn

Topic of

Dr. Price Gwynn of the Psychol-
ogy department, was the speaker of

the morning at the regular chapel
period on last Thursday, when
Armistice Day was celebrated.

Dr. Gwynn /spoke on peace and
what the United States is able to
do to promote a universal realizaz
tion of the fact that war must be
abandoned. His suggestions as to
the answer of this question fell
into two divisions: measures to
meet the present emergency and
measures to develop a long time
policy of international co-operation
and to lessen the chances of war in
the future.

In the. first group of measures
Dr. Gwynn emphatically stated that
our government should carefully
refrain from taking sides in the
conflicts now raging in different
parts of the world. It should be
made clear that this country will
not go to war to protect either its
nationals or their commerce in the
zones of hostility.

Dr. Gwynn stated that he was

program and other such measures
to curb nationalistic arrogance. In
the future- we-should attempt to
maintain adequate national defense
against iavasion and for that pur- |
pose only, and we should work for

declare war without putting the
issue to a vote of the people. Pro-
visions should be made for taking
profit out of war by conscripting
capital, industry, and labor before
the nation’s manhood is cons¢ript-
ed.

In concluding, Dr. Gwynn made a
fine statement: “Ii we hope to de-
liver our children from the constant
threat of wholesale slaughter w
must manifest a persistent will to
peace—a genuine loathing of war
in any form. -War destroys life.
What is worse, dt destroys the very
things which make life worth liv-
ing — truth, honor, beauty, human
faith, friendship, and love.”
