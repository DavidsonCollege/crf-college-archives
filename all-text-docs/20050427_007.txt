Taking music to the next level

By AMOURA CARTER

“Shocking,” says Damion White ‘05,

when asked to depict his upcoming debut
album: not because it’s wild and uncultivat-
ed work, but because it is turning out to
become one
that might win
numerous
awards in the
near future.
This 22-
year-old gradu-
ating senior is
definitely
ready for the

next level
musically.
White might
have literally
started work-
ing on_ his
album this

semester dur-
ing independ-
ent study, but it
has technically

been a_ long
process that
started his

sophomore
year. “I wanted
to find some
way to heal my community. I never thought
about entering the music industry, I was still
thinking about the NBA,” he says as he
laughs. “But realistically I wanted to. be a
teacher, but then I heard Jesus Walks by
Kanye West and thought WOW he is becom-
ing popular with this song.”

And around that same time he was intro-
duced to the Sloan recording studio and was
then able to take Dr. Lawing’s electronic
music class. “A blessing,” is how White
describes everything that has happened to
him. That is where White’s rollercoaster ride
began and he has not gotten off yet.

White planned to finish his CD by April
11, but his perfectionism got in the way; he
wanted to step it up a notch. He decided to

get his CD’s pressed (not burned) and pack-
aged for a more professional look. Damion is
now trying to get his CD, “Independent
Study,” rightly called, rush ordered so
Davidson can get the first sneak peek.

As talented as White has become, he did
not create “Independent Study” alone. He
credits two peo-
ple for taking
him under their
wings, producers
Edrick Milles
and Davidson

student, Cory
Maluski 06.
“They —_—recog-

nized my desire,
and allowed that
to excuse my
music incompé-
tence,” White
said. He has also
collaborated
with Trenita
Brookshire ’05
and = Christian
Hunt ’05 on the
more smooth
tracks on_ his
album.

“Independent
study” complete-
ly surprised me,
because after a
while of listening to the CD, I completely
forgot it was Damion White, Davidson stu-
dent, and I started to think it was a song I
could be hearing on MTV or BET.” White
makes music for all types of people, which is
why he describes his CD as “urban.” He says
it is urban because it is not rap or hip hop; a
mix of people can experience city life, and
we connect in the urban scene with club,
Southern, rock music etc. which all fall
under the umbrella of urban.

If you are looking for something new and
refreshing, check out Damion White’s CD,
“Independent Study,” for $10 and you can
pre-order right now. Also visit his website

city life into the mic.

Avoid the fever o’spring

By LAuRA BEACH
Special Contributor

It’s getting to be that time of the year when
the weather is beckoning us forth from
Chambers and the library, but the weight of
our books keeps us from going farther than a
blanket on the lawn. This is a shame.

But even if papers and tests rule out a full
weekend of outdoor bliss, yeu must continue
to eat and sleep. Why not take these activi-
ties outdoors?

The Outdoor Advisor is ready to make this
as easy and efficient as possible for maxi-
mum enjoyment.

Sustenance

A hearty meal does a lot to keep you
healthy and alert for your academic as well
as extra-curricular. pursuits. Therefore,
skimping here is not recommended.

While the tables behind Commons or on
the patio of the Union provide a breath of
fresh air, why not prepare the whole meal

yourself at lovely locations such as Hobart

Park or the lake campus? Use one of the
grills there or come to Davidson Outdoors
and rent a stove.

You can make Silver Turtles (ground beef,
vegetables, spices wrapped in aluminum foil
and cooked over coals for 15-30 minutes) or
try your hand at pita pizzas (tomato sauce,
mozzarella cheese, and toppings of choice on
a pita, sautéed in butter).

For the more adventurous hearts and bel-

lies,- DO has great resources, such as
Cooking the One-Burner Way: Gourmet
Cuisine for the Backcountry Chef,
Lipsmackin’ Backpackin’, and Camp Cook’s
Companion.

Each cookery is filled with intriguing
recipes that have fun names like “Tilton’s
Traveling Oatcakes,” “Mr. Natural’s Fried
Fowl,” and  “Hanging-by-Your-Boots
Upside-Down Cake.” Whether you’ ve had a
long day of hiking or of researching, these
tasty treats are sure to please.

Slumber

Warning: These meals may create the urge
to continue the camp experience.

In this case, you could head out to the
cross-country trails and find a nice little side
path where you can set up camp. Check the
forecast, and then don’t forget a flashlight, a
warm hat, and some water.

You may also want a watch so you won’t
miss class or breakfast the next morning.

For a less rugged experience, you could
talk to Lynda Daniels in the Union about
renting Erwin Lodge for the evening. (It’s
free to students, but no alcohol is allowed on
the premises).

This little oasis includes a full kitchen,
flush toilets, and a fireplace.

Even if all of this seems completely unap-
pealing to you, the Outdoor Advisor hopes
you will at least put down the books long
enough to toss around a Frisbee, ride a bike,
or go for a walk on the trails or around town.
