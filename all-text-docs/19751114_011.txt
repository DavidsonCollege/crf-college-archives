Mc Euen recounts ‘Dirt Band’

By CATHY LANDIS
Staff Writer

One day last week Russ Kushigian
received a telephone call. ‘‘I don’t
know how to tell you this, but John
McEuen wants to play in your room.”
It must have ‘‘cracked him up.”

When the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band
played last month, McEuen noticed
the 900 room. ‘‘Gee, that’s a nice
room,”’ he said.

When he got time off from the tour
he decided to come back here instead
of sitting around doing nothing.
Besides, he likes Davidson, He likes
the people; he likes the ‘‘nice quiet
town.”

Most of all, McEuen likes to play.
It seems to ‘‘crack him up.’’ His

instruments are the guitar, banjo,
mandolin, and, occasionally, the fid-
dle. McEven never had any formal
musical training. ‘‘I’ve never been
housebroken,’’ he said. What he
knows about both the practical and
the theoretical aspects of music he
learned by himself.

He doesn’t have a particular song
that he enjoys above the others. He
primarily likes to play things-that will
effect people. ‘‘It’s more fun than
boring them.’’ He enjoys backing up
singers both in concert and on records
more than any other job. He has
backed up Linda Ronstadt, for
example, frequently, but McEuen has
never recorded with her. ‘‘I’m just too
easy-going for her.’’

other artists. The band started out of
Long Beach, California in 1966. Their
strongest point lay in their versatility
which they have maintained to this
day.

McEuen calls the band’s music
“Traditional Popular Music,’’ a term
which can include as many types of
music 9s the band plays.

‘hey give performances in any-
thing from: Rock-and-Roll, to folk, to
country, to bluegrass. They perform
anywhere from rowdy Texas daytime
bashes, to outdoor festivals, to con-
certs in good halls: the latter by which
Davidson is classified.

Probably the most talked about
accomplishment of the band so far has

. been their album Will the Circle Be

Unbroken. Produced by John’s
brother Bill in 1966, the album
became one of the most important
albums of the Nashville music busi-
ness.
Starting with Earl Scruggs and.
Doc Watson, the band managed to
pull together Mother Maybelle Car
ter, Roy Acuff, Merle Travis, Jimmy
_ Martin, Vassar Clements, and Nor-

man .Blake who, in one album,
tmanaged to present the best concise
répresentation of the “Old Guard”’
-coyntry music that hdd come out of
“Nashville in a long time.

Equally as important, the album
-bridged the cultural gap between the
country ‘‘establishment’' and the
younger rock-and-roll culture.

‘McEuen does not think that the
“.Nitty Gritty Dirt Band has yet
* reached its peak. ‘‘We’ve never really
made it,’ he smiled. Specifically he
réfers to concert crowds.

Their largest crowds gather in
. Kansas City, Atlanta, New Mexico,

Denver, and Dallas where they
usually attract from 5 to 6000 people.

The tirst Southern concert that the
band ever played was at Davidson
five years ago. “‘C. Shaw Smith put
the Dirt Band in the South.’’ Coming
to the South was actually a big move
for the band. They came just after
Easy Rider had been releasedy~” ~

One of the members, Jeff Hanna,
even cut his hair. Their fears were not
relieved when the first person they
bumped into in the Atlanta airport
was a 400 lb. policeman. After their
reception 9m the Southern audience,
however, they dropped their preju-
dices.

In John’s opinion, the band ex-
perienced their worst show in Ken-
tucky last year. ‘‘We got a little
wiser,’’ he said. Thinking that the
crowd had come to see them, they
gave little attention to Jim Stafford
who opened before them untill after he
had received 3 or 4 standing ovations.

After the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band
began, the crowd dropped from 6000
to 2500.

McEuen never tires of playing, but
he does of travelling. Sometimes they
are on the road for 15 hours only to do
an hour and a half show. With that
short a time, they have to make their
show good to make it worth it.

There are more advantages to being
a star than simply the opportunity to
play and perform. McEuen goes to
almost any concert free of charge.

Of course, as McEuen said, the
road to stardom isn’t easy. John asks
anyone who expresses an interest in
pursuing a career in popular music if
they like to be frustrated. He feels like
it’s one of the hardest thing a person
can do. And there are so many
setbacks. What if, for instance, he
breaks a fingernail? ‘‘I wait.’’ he
replied.

Funkadelic record slays imitators

eee

By RUSTY LINDSEY

Funkadelic in the years of its
existence, has undergone as many
internal changes as any group.
Through seven albums, however, the
musical idea has continued to: be
developed and advanced. With the
release of Funkadelic in 1968, a new
form of such music was unleashed.
Funkadelic employed a wailing lead
alien to most previous soul under-
takings, resulting in a sound distinc-
tly psychedelic. Interjecting social
commentary along with biting satire
on a variety of subjects, Funkadelic
has evolved a unique style that has
resulted in a loyal cult following,
traditionally among young Blacks of

' college and high-school age. The past
couple of years, however, have prod-
uced a number of singles which have
enjoyed moderate to good success.
Among these were A Joyful Process
(1972), Shading in the Verge (1974),
and Stuff and Things (1975).

Funkadelic’s latest album, Let's
‘Take It to the Stage, continues in the
tradition of their past releases. As
before, the music is a collage of
images, impressions, and sounds.
Highlighted throughout is the excel-
lent play of two of the newer members
of Funkadelic, bassist Ray Davis and
guitarist Mike Hammond. Their
forceful playing stands out noticeably

America Eats Its Young Bo e

Cosmic Slop

Standing on the Verge of Getting It On

from the ma s of sound Funkadelic
puts forth. As always, the lyrics of
George Ointon are both compelling
and complex, assaulting the mind.

Side one begins with a boogie-funk
number which shows Funkadelic at
its best. Good to Your Earhole isa
foot-stomping exhortation to get the
party down. Hammond uses the
was-wah to perfection, while the
rhythm section lays down heavy funk
line.

The next three songs on the side are
intriguing. Better by the Pound is a
testimonial to marijuana and the role
it has come to play in the lives of our
young. In this cut, music takes back
seat to words as Funkadelic tells us
“There’s a tidal wave of mysticism
surging througn our jet-age genera-
tion,’’ and remind us of the pitfalls of
dope--‘‘we've got to have it more than
we ought to...”

Let's Take It to the Stage

The third cut, Be My Beach, isa
straight-faced example of the pseudo-
chauvinistic attitude of today’s men.
The singer tells his beach (woman)
that she’s not the only woman in the
world. As in Better by the Pound,
vocals are again the focal point,
weaving a tale of sexual exploration.

The theme of sex and the extent to

which it pervades human relation-
ships reaches to apex in No Head, No
Backstage Pass, which message con-
cerns a groupie named Jan and the
conditions the band places on her
backstage attendance.

She said, ‘‘I know the drummer,
can you let me in? Tell the guitar

‘player I balled a friend. Ask the

roadies, do they need a hand? Tell the
manager there’s a girl named Jan.”
Thorus: Stop your prancing. No head,
no backstage pass.

As you can see the lyrics need no

explanation (unless you're naive as
hell). Track four is the high point of
the album, in which Funkadelic pokes
fun at all the ‘‘Funk” bands now in
vogue, referring to ‘‘Slufus’’ (Rufus),

‘The Godfather’’ (James Brown),

‘‘Earth, Hot Air, and No Fire’”’
(Earth, Wind and Fire), ‘‘Slick and
the Family Trick’’ (Sly), and their
vain attempts at emulating the Funk
Mob, as Funkadelic calls themselves.

They decry the fact that they have
advocated the pusuit of junkiness,
while their erstwhile competitors have
attempted to tread a fine line between
general acceptance and self-satis-
faction. The fact that Funkadelic
loves their music, and loves making
it, is reflected in the hip-shaking
conclusion of side one, Get Off Your
Ass and Jam, a rousing call to party
hard.

The rhythm core of Hammond
guitar, Davis on bottom, and veteran
Funkadelic Tiki Fulwood on drums
pound out one of the best party songs
of the year. The song adapts to music
a phrase popular a few years ago at
parties where people would exhort,
“Shit, Goddamn, Get off your ass and
jam!”

Side two is different from side one
in that it is exploratory in nature.
Bernie Worrell’s keyboards predomi-
nate weaving patterns about the’
listener.
