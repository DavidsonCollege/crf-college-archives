The Davidson football team is fam-
ous not only because ‘its members fight
like tigers and run like cats, and tackle
like thunderbolts, and hold like bull
dogs, not only because they scrap till the
last minute, winning or not, not only
heeause they “outplay both on offensive”
heavier teams, and not only because they
have one of the best of coaches, but be-
cause they play clean ball, a gentleman's
wame, because out of the game they im
press everyone as gentlemen,

The following is an extract of a letter
written by Mr. W. G. Perry, an alum-
nus of Davidson, now a Professor of
English in Georgia ‘Tech.:

Before these lines reach you, the Dav-
idson-Georgia ‘Pech game will have been
a thing of the dimming past: the team
will have returned to the home campus
and will have told you such details as
their modesty may permit; you will have
read accounts of the game in Atlanta
papers that they have carried home with
them. You will know how ‘a Little
Red ‘Team that knew how to die, but
not to surrender” (1 quote from = my
morning paper) met a team reckoned the
strongest, or among the strongest, in the
South, renresenting a college twice the
sive of Davidson and outweighing the
Davidson team almost twenty, pounds
per man, and lost by a lone touchdown
and a ragged safety. To know all this,
however, is to know nothing of the game.
“No such form before midseason, and
rarely on Turkey day itself, has ever
heen manifested as was the work of
Davidson Saturday.” ‘To beat a team
of the calibre of Davidson is an honor
of which any team should be proud.”
Thus speaks Morgan Blake in the Sun-
day “Journal.” When a “home” paper
writes such words of a “foreign” ath-
letic team, there must be unusually good
cause, ,

Were it merely a question of playing
the game well, there were reason enough
among Davidson men for pride in their
team; but there was something more.
far more, immortant. It was a game
plaved by gentlemen—clean, fair, snorts-
manlike.
phasived in the grandstand, among the
crowd leaving the grounds, by a group
of men going up in an elevator with me.

T can trust those fellows to observe
heir pledges and behave themselves a
beolutely when | am away from then
s when I have them under my eye,”
eard Coach Fetzer say; and I believe
im. This is the second consecutiv
ear that Davidson has sent a team 0’
his kind to play in Atlanta; as long a
he colloge has such men to play foot-
‘all, and such a man to coach these men
he name of the college is in good hands.
' had the pleasure and privilege to sit ir
heir company at a little dinner follow-
‘ng the game, where alumni and futurc
slumni met; and | was proud that those
ean-cut young fellows and {1 claimed

‘he same Alma Mater.

Both the students and the faculty of
Davidson College ought to know what
Atlanta thinks of their football team, in
case they fail to realize just what it
means to the college. | think it possible
that you may be able to cull for reprint-
ing a passage or two from the Atlanta
papers which I am sending you, espe-
cially that fine tribute to “Bill” Fetzer
‘vhich the Journal publishes.

Cordially your friend.

GOOD PRINTING

CONSISTS OF MORE THAN INK, TYPE & PAPER
eee

While there is nothing mysterious about the process, it requires, among
other things, good judgment, taste, and a desire to keep ahead or above the
average. The goodness of printing is governed by the printer’s equipment
plus his ability to use it. We have a generous supply of both and are con-
stantly adding to them.

Our line embraces all kinds and classes of work, but
we prefer to do the better kind. If you desire the
best in any class we can meet your requirements,
and guarantee to please you.
