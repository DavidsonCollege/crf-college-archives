Made Lucky Strike

It is beginning to look as if President
Allen made a lucky strike when he
signed Pitcher “Dutch” Hengeveld tor
pitching assignments for the 1919 Trav-
elers. The big collegian was given a
good boost a few days ago by an At-
lanta scribe.

The Cracker writer said that it has

pitcher had not been nabbed by some
club a year or two ago. It is not a mys-

and he would not consent to playing
professional baseball then for fear of
ruining his college athletic standing. The
Atlanta journalist went on to say that
Hengeveld was a very promising youns-

University. He said that . Hengeveld
was a big fellow, weighing in the neigh-

now manager of the San Antonio club
of the ‘Texas League, made several trips
to the Carolina school for the purpose
of signing the Davidson College hurler.
