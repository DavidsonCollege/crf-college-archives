Science buildings to be renovated

By Meg Wolff

With recent news that the sci-
‘ences will receive $5 to 7 million
from the Campaign for Davidson,
majors may not have to wait much
longer for updated and expanded
facilities. The money has been
specifically earmarked for a life
sciences addition to Dana Science
building and renovation of both

research and teaching labs.

In a recent letter to alumni,
President John Kuykendall de-
scribes the need for updated sci-
ence facilities as great: “So lim-
ited is space that Davidson faculty
and students are holding labora-
tory classes and lectures in the attic
of Dana.” The letter also states
that “none of the biology or neuro-
science research laboratories is
configured as a modern research

- lab must be.”
Kuykendall

says that

“Davidson’s well deserved repu-
tation for excellence in the sci-
ences and pre-medicine is threat-
ened by profoundly outdated and
cramped facilities poorly suited to
the pursuit of modern research.”
The expansion of Dana Science
building is slated to begin as soon
as the needed money is raised.

With a goal of $150 million,
the Campaign for Davidson has
raised $142 million in gifts and
pledges so far, an entire year be-
fore the Campaign is scheduled to
end.. Campaign funds have al-
ready gone towards such improve-
ments as endowed professorships,
new named scholarships, the Vi-
sual Arts Center, and the new resi-
dence hall.

Biology Chair Verna Case is
enthusiastic about the plans: “It’s
a great first step in addressing the
science facility needs at Davidson.”

FIVE YEARS AGO...

On September 23, 1989, President John Kuykendall begins to clean-up Davidson after it was hit hard
by the violent winds and torrential rains of Hurricane Hugo. Five years later, Hugo is simply a distant
memory, with all damages caused by that time now completely cleaned up thanks to efforts by
individuals like President Kuykendall. In fact, the college was hit so hard by the hurricane that The

Davidsonian was unable to print for three consecutive weeks. Whatever did Davidson College students
do without The Davidsonian?!?

SGA ad hoc committee studies honor code

Review continued from page 1

Code more stringent, or publiciz-
ing the results of actual trials. Also,
the SGA agrees that the Honor
Council should be viewed as a
more punitive body.

Kappa Sig Senator Alex
Crumbley states, “For people to
respect it, they have to be afraid of
it.” Other senators agree that stu-
dents take the Honor Code for
granted and should be made more
aware of the benefits derived from.

‘the system, such as closed trials,

take-home reviews, and self-sched-
uled examinations.

c\rthur Gaston, Chairman of
the Honor Council, who will co-
chair the committee with Buford,
said, “I firmly support the SGA’s
ad hoc committee. I’m glad that
the SGA has taken the initiative to

look into such an important aspect ~

of our community, andT look for-
ward to working with Warren in
the next few weeks.”

Buford says that since

Tuesday’s SGA meeting, several _

students have expressed an inter-
est in being on the committee.

Though the committee itself will
most likely be composed of only
ten to 15 students, Buford encour-
ages students to speak freely with
any SGA representative. Buford
hopes to encourage student forums

of the Honor Code.

“We don’t plan on keeping
this quiet,” says Buford. "We want
to promote as much discussion and
debate on the Honor Code as we
can, just really go and find out

and debates on the various aspects __ what people think.”
