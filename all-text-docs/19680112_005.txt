Amassing an impressive at-

for Saturday's game with
West Virginia by overwhelm-
ing George Washington, 107-

double figures for Davidson,

1-11 record into the game.

Davidson came out in a
vicious full-court press and
a fast-break attack that the
Cotontals just could not
handle. With a. Ilifle over
one minute of playing time
elapsed, the visitors found

ball into their forecourt at

Overall, George Washing-

Wildcats; ‘Ups and Downs’

“You can play real good basketball in the next six
games and get beat.” Lefty told us this before CIT
(Charlotte Invitational Tournament), referring to the
CIT, Sugar Bowl, Duke, and St. John’s games. Our
record of 4-2 for those games is fair but not equivalent
to the excellence Lefty demands..

At a New Orleans alumni luncheon, Lefty com-
mented on an admirer’s hope that we would play good
basketball in the Sugar Bowl Tournament. He told the
gathering, “I’m not worried about playing good. I
want to win.” This brings to mind the answer by Ken-
tucky’s Adoph Rupp to the statement, “It’s not whether
you win or lose, it’s how you play the game.” Rupp
tersely answered, “Why keep score?” Well anyway,
we lost to Vanderbilt and played poorly at that. Then
we lost to Duke despite the fact that we played well.

After beating William & Mary in a sloppy game
with the subs participating in the last 19 seconds, (to
get our names in the box score as Lefty told us) we
clobbered Rice in the first game of the CIT. Rice lived
up to the expectations of Texas basketball by finishing
last in the tournament. In the Tuesday night finals with
previously undefeated Temple, we tried to give them
the game but they wouldn’t take it even after we threw
two passes away and missed a layup in the last minute
of the game. We played bad and won so we were “up.”
In reality, 1 think we were “up” for the opportunity to
go home for the first time since October when the

season began.

Lefty greeted us in New Orleans the day after
Christmas with a three hour workout. For those of
you who haven’t been to the Mardi Gras city, it has a
flavor of many different places. The cab drivers speak
with a Brooklyn accent and the mini-skirt is common
dress. The coaches took us to a reputable place on
Bourbon Street where scanty clad girls danced on the
tables. Bob Pickens and Fox Demoisey thought it was
a good idea and exhibited their Davidson dancing
talent by joining the girls on the tables. Maybe the
Jups we were drinking were a bit too strong. We ate at
Antoine's in the Mystery Room which proved to be an
appropriate name, for the waiters served us Pampano
in the Sack (a fish concoction in a paper container). It
turned out to be good when we found out we didn’t
have to eat the bag.

We beat Memphis State in the first game despite
their slow style of play. The next night we were
trounced by “Tommy Gun” Hagan and Vanderbilt as
we played one of our poorest games of the season. We
were “down” after that experience especially because
none of us could understand why we played so badly.

Amidst the flying apple cores and insults, we lost
to Duke last Wednesday. Going into the game Duke had
a 69-4 record at home which is comparable to our 45
straight in Johnston Gym. Imagine a place like John-
ston Gym three times larger and you have Duke Indoor
Stadium. But despite the crowd we did blow a seven
point lead and lost. Their outside shooting was tremen-
dous and Mike Lewis was good inside. We played well
and lost, and we stayed “down.”

Flying into New York, the city seemed to be end-
less and after riding in the subways, buses, and cabs,
I’m almost sure it is. I have to agree with the people
who say that New York is a fascinating place to visit
but they wouldn’t want to live there. Flagging down a
taxi is like trying to find a girl in Davidson during the
week. We rode to the game in Holiday Inn courtesy
VW buses and despite this, everyone seemed to be
relaxed. Maybe this was the reason why our outside
shooting was accurate and we controlled the game for
the most part. But possibly St. John’s was not ready
for us and consequently we “blew them out of the
gym” as Lefty said after the game.

Now the team is “up” and if we play like we did
against St. John’s, we'll stay that way.

in the contest. Another
‘pleasant aspect of David-
son’s play was the tow
number of turnovers. The
Wiideats only gave the bail
away 11 times.

A hot 56.7 percentage on
their shots from the floor
raised the team's season floor
percentage to 50.4.

The ease of the win gave
the ‘Cats a breather before
their next game, another

game, to be played tomorrow

West Virginia is having on

but the Mountaineers always

Virginia in Morgantown.

Davidson's coach Charles

Injury Requires Surgery;
Sidelines Beach Indefinitely

By JIM CROUSE
Sports Writer
Eddie Beach, team captain
and record-holder in two
events for the Davidson
swimming team, underwent
surgery following a knee in-
jury over the Christmas holi-
day. His services have been
lost to the ‘Catfish for an in-
definite period of time.
Beach was valuable to
the team both because of
his swimming ability and
his help to coach Tom Ste-
vens in instructing the
swimmers.
A fall, suffered in a sand-

lot basketball game, fractur-
ed Beach's kneecap, break-
ing it into three pieces. Two
of the pieces were removed
in an operation the day after
the accident, the other piece
left in place, serving as a
diminutive kneecap.

“The first thing I thought
about was whether or not I
could swim again, That's
funny,” Eddie said. ‘‘I didn't
even think about walking —
just whether or not I could
swim again.”

Beach said that he does
not know how serious the
effects of the operation wilt

Special Course
To Be Available

A special physical educa-
tion class will be offered next
quarter. The activities of the
class, directed by Coach
Homer Smith, are intended
to improve the condition of
the members of the pro-
gram.

Meeting three times a
week at four in the after-
noon, participants will do a
certain set of conditioning
exercises each class period.
As the quarter progresses
the members of the class
will try to improve their
performance in the exercis-
es.

Membership in the class is
open to any freshman or up-

perclassman. Anyone inter-
ested in participating in the
class should contact Smith
or coach Dave Fagg.

Credit will be received for
taking this course in that it
will replace the student's or-
dinary PE requirement. The
class will be especially bene-
ficial to students who are in-
terested in getting into good
physical condition as well as
fulfilling a PE requirement.

Most of the class’ activi-
ties will be in the small gym.
Horizontal bar, parallel bar,
rope and other activities are
among the exercises in the
special conditioning pro-
gram.

The breast stroke is one of
Beach's best events. He cur-
rently holds the Davidson
record in the 200 yard breast
stroke.

He feels that he will now
have to concentrate on the
free style races. He is also
the record-holder in the 1000
yard free style.

Beach is eager to get in
the water again. ‘The doc.
tor said that swimming
would be the best form of
exercise with which to build
it up again,” he grinned.
Although he could not swim

in yesterday's meet against
Clemson or today's meet in
Boone against Appalachian,
Beach is hopeful to be able
to swim in the Southern Con-
ference meet the first week
in March.

1968: ITS CAUSE AND CURE

Are you still writing “1967” on your papers and letters ?
I'l bet you are, you scamp! But I am not one to be harsh
with those who forgot we are in a new year, for I myself
have long been guilty of the same lapse. In fact, in my
senior year at college, I wrote 1873 on my papers until
nearly November of 1874! (It turned out, incidentally,
not to be such a serious error because, as we all know, 1874
was later repealed by President Chester A. Arthur ina fit
of pique over the Black Tom Explosion. And, as we all
know, Mr. Arthur later came to regret his hasty action.
Who does not recall that famous meeting between Mr.
Arthur and Louis Napoleon when Mr. Arthur said, “Lou,
I wish I hadn't of repealed 1874:’ Whereupon the French
emperor made his immortal rejoinder, ‘‘Tipi que nous et
tyler tu’. Well sir, they had many a good laugh about that,

as you can imagine. )

But I digress. How can we remember to write 1968 on
our papers and letters? Well sir, the best way is to find
something memorable about 1968, something unique to fix
it firmly in your mind. Happily, this is very. simple be-
cause, as we all know, 1968 is the first year in history that
is divisible by 2, by 5, and by 7. Take a pencil and try it:
1968 divided by 2 is 984; 1968 divided by 5 is 393%; 1968
divided by 7 is 2814. This mathematical curiosity will not
occur again until the year 2079, but we will all be so busy
then celebrating the Chester A. Arthur bi-centenerary
that we will scarcely have time to be writing papers and

letters and like that.

Another clever little trick to fix the year 1968 in your
mind is to remember that 1968 spelled backwards is 8691.
“Year” spelled backwards is “raey:’ ““Personna” spelled
backwards is ‘“‘Annosrep’’ I mention Personna because I
am paid to write this column by the makers of Personna
Super Stainless Steel Blades, and they are inclined to
withhold my check if I omit to mention their product.

Not, mind you, that it is any chore for me to sing the
praises of Personna, for it is a seemly blade that shaves
you cleanly, a gleaming blade that leaves you beaming, a
trouble-free blade that leaves you stubble-free, a match-
less blade that leaves you scratchless. If you are tired of
facial slump, if you are fed up with jowl blight, try
Personna today... available both in double-edge style and
Injector style. And if I seem a bit excessive in my admira-
tion for Personna, I ask you to remember that to me
Personna is more than a razor blade; it is also an employer.

But I digress. We were speaking of the memorable as-
pects of 1968 and high among them, of course, is the fact
that in 1968 the entire House of Representatives stands
for election. There will, no doubt, be many lively and inter-
esting contests, but none, I'll wager, quite so lively and
interesting as the one in my own district where the lead-
ing candidate is none other than Chester A. Arthur!

Mr. Arthur, incidentally, is not the first ex-president to
come out of retirement and run for the House of Repre-
sentatives. John Quincy Adams was the first. Mr. Adams
also holds another distinction: he was the first son of a
president ever to serve as president. It is true that Martin
Van Buren’s son, Walter “Blinky” Van Buren, was at one
time offered the nomination for the presidency, but he,
alas, had already accepted a bid to become Mad Ludwig
of Bavaria. James K. Polk’s son, on the other hand, be-
came Salmon P. Chase. Millard Fillmore’s son went into
aluminum siding. This later became known as the Mis-

souri Compromise.
