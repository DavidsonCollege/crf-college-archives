tennis coach andhe has justnotched
his 400 and 401st wins of his ca-
reer.

With a5-2 win Saturday morn-
ing over Charleston Southern, the
Wildcats beat what Frank called "a
real good team."

The win came in Frank's sec-
ond try last week for the milestone
win. On Monday, Davidson faced
off against defending Southern
Conference champions Georgia
Southern, but fell 5-2.

After topping Charleston
Southern Saturday, Frank and his
Wildcats beat Belmont Abbey for
win number 401.

Monday against Georgia

Southern, freshmen Jon Pastel and
Ted Kaplan both logged outstand-
ing performances at the number
two and three singles positions.
They dominated against two of the
best players in the conference at
their position. But GSU took some
close matches for the win.

Saturday morning, Davidson
opened against Charleston South-
ern with excellent doubles play to
capture the doubles point. The
team then played strong singles to
secure the big win.

The celebration did no last

long since the Wildcats had to take
the court against Belmont Abbey
later that afternoon. Belmont Ab-
bey played surprisingly well in the
doubles, winning at the number
one position. Davidson was able
to pull out close matches at the
other two doubles positions tocome
away with the doubles point.
After suffering losses at the
one and two singles positions, the
Wildcats definitely needed a spark.
It was provided by junior Bill
Mitchem who was making his
singles debut. Mitchem played

exceptionally well to win at num-
ber three singles. Davidson was
able to take the remaining singles
matches to win 5-2. Davidson's
next plays today at 2 p.m. against
Wofford.

In his 23rd season at Davidson,
Frank is still just as enthused about
coaching tennis as when he started.

"I still really enjoy it," he said.
"The highlight for me is the kids at
Davidson. .. . College athletics are

Senior led
Wildcats
handle
UNCC

In their last game against
county rival UNCC, the rugby
team’s seniors went into the match
with a mission: to defeat UNCC

one last time and keep Davidson
undefeated on the season.

Senior captain Simon Priestley
helped lead the charge, often times
shouting for higher intensity. At
one point, he even challenged the
defending players to tackle him.

Priestley’s call was answered,
and the seniors completed. their
mission, beating the 49ers 17-10 in
the first game and 12-7 in the sec-
ond.

But it wasn’t that easy. In
usual fashion, UNCC fielded a
strong team and took a command-
ing 10-0 lead at halftime in the first
game:

After senior Tom Shelburne’s
motivational halftime -speech,
Davidson played the best second
half of its season.

Shortly after the beginning of
the second half, Priestley ran into
the try zone for five points and then
converted the kick-after.

Sean Callahan,.anewcomer to
the squad, scored the second try in
fine stride, and Priestley converted
the kick-after again. A penalty
kick worth three points ended
Davidson’s 17-point halftime per-
formance.

The second game wasn’t as
intense, given Davidson’s fatigue,
but with senior Jeremy Potter’s
help, Davidson was able to pull
away for the win. His try near the
end of the game secured the vic-
tory.

Through out the day, every
Davidson player gave his heart,
but seniors like Shelburne, Potter,
Priestley, Callahan and John Walsh
carried the team in fitting form.

Baseballs left Wildcat Park
in a hurry this week.

In two days, in two games
against two Atlantic Coast Con-
ference teams, fans saw 14 home
runs.

Tuesday, Davidson lost 9-7
to N.C. State, a team ranked as
high as 18th in some polls.

But Wednesday, the Wild-
cats more than redeeined them-
selves, beating Wake Forest 9-8,
a regular foe that Davidson had
not beaten in 19 games over seven
years and one that had beaten
Davidson 19-1 earlier this sea-
son.

With two wins this weekend
at East Tennessee State, Coach
Dick Cooke reached the one hun-
dred win mark in his fifth season
at Davidson.

The Wildcats (10-14, 6-6 in
the Southern Conference) started
out hot against N.C. State and held
a 7-3 lead going into the seventh
inning behind the pitching of Brian
Cole and the hitting of Gus
Quattlebaum.

But Cole began to tire in the
seventh, and the bullpen was un-
able to stop a rally by N.C. State
that yielded six runs. After the
comeback, Mills Ariail shut out
the Wolfpack to close the game,
but Davidson’s hot bats had done
all they could against such a tough
team.

Despite the loss, coach Dick
Cooke was not disappointed with
his team’s performance saying he
was pleased to be “playing with
one of the best.”

Wednesday, the story was very
similar. Going into the seventh
inning against Wake Forest, the
Wildcats had builta 9-2 lead. Again
they were hitting well behind a
favorable wind in what Cooke calls
“a friendly offensive park.”

Quattlebaum had two home
runs to cap off a great two days of
hitting for him. In the two games,

aseball whips Wake

he was a combined 5 for 8 at the
plate with three home runs.

Davidson never trailed in the
game, starting off the scoring in
the first inning when Jeff Andrews
hit a two-run home run. In the
third, Michael New nailed another
two-run shot for a 5-1 lead, after
Quattlebaum opened the inning
with a solo home run.

Rhett Ingerick picked up two
RBI in the fifth, scoring Brian
Penny and Dréw Van Culin with a
double. Mark Reilly then brought
Ingerick home with a single.

Quattlebaum made the score 9-2 in

the sixth with his second homer of
the game.

The Wildcats then had a scare
in the seventh, the same inning
which proved deadly the day be-
fore. Jonathan Coulombe had been
pitching very well for six innings,
but Wake Forest began to rally.

This time, though, Davidson
“didn’t let it get out of control,”
said Cooke. After five Deacon

run lead,

of his aces, Chris Pollard, who
made short order of the Deacons.
He shut down the last three bat-
ters to finish the game. After-
wards, Cooke said, “It was a great
win to beat an ACC team.”

At times this season they’ ve
had hitting and pitching slumps,
but that was not so this week.
Pollard said, “For the first time
this season, we had both things
together at once.”

The Wildcats hope to keep
the combination going against
Southern Conference competition
and move up from the middle of
the standings. Pollard sees the
team’s good performances against
these two ACC teams as a mo-
mentum booster, but his coach
has a different opinion.

In a game where, according
to Cooke, “one pitcher on the
mound can make a huge differ-
ence,” he worries more about
complacency. He saw his team
get swept last year one weekend
after defeating #1-ranked Geor-
gia Tech.
