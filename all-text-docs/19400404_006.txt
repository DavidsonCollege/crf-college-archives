ECHOES OF THE
PAST

THREE YEARS AGO

Lenoir-Rhyne defeated David-
son Wildcats 7-1 in the first
game of the season. The lone run
of the day for the home team
scored by Partridge.
FIVE YEARS AGO

Elon College bowed to David-
son’s scrapping baseball team in
a slugging contest by the score
of 15 to 8. Mathis starred for
Davidson in the hitting depart-
ment by knocking out three hits
in four trips to the bat.

Yow! Appears ’'Mid Hisses and
Cheers. The winning jokes in-
cluded this bit of humor. “Who
was that lady I saw you with
last night?” “That was no lady
that was my wife.”

The student body voted un-
animously to give half of the
damage fee return at the end
of the school to equip the col-
lege band.
