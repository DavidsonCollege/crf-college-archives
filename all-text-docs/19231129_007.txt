VANCE, Guard
Davidson
Harry's work was outstanding in the
Clemson game. He made a majority of the
Davidson tackles, throwing the Tiger backs
for losses time after time.

Nappy is holding down the left wing for

the third successive year. He has not gotten
away for any sensational gains on passes, and
is due to star in the Trinity scrap.

COX, Tackle
N. C. State

Cox, Logan’s running mate at the tackle
position played a great game against the
Cats. Davidson was unable to pierce his side
of the line with much success.

he -played at center and made a large per-
centage of the tackles.

| Moran of Wake Forest is the choice for
ithe other tackle. Before coming to Wake
| Forest he played at Georgetown University.
| He tips the beam at 185 pounds, has an ideal
build for a tackle, and has been one of the
most powerful factors in the Wake Forest
| line which allows its speedy backfield to get
juway with very little opposition from the
enemy. Matthews of Carolina is another
tackle whose work this year has shown up
| well.

Poindexter of Carolina has the call at
guard. He is an experienced player, well-
versed in all the tricks of the grid game and
was picked by most authorities on last year’s’
mythical selections. He stands out this year
above all the guards in the state.

Captain Simpson of Trinity is shifted from
center to fill the other guard position. Play-
ing his fourth year on the Trinity team, he
is the best linesman in the Blue Devil camp.

note. In addition to his other merits he is a
drop-kicker who seldom misses, and the extra
point after touchdown is as good as chalked
up when the score is made.

The best running halfback in the state is
also a Carolina player. Rabbitt Bonner, by
his unequalled broken field running wins a
halfback position. Against Davidson, Rab-

At fullback, Coach Younger picks Al
Johnston of N.C, State. This back was the
chief ground gainer in the Davidson-State

steam roller and then skidded on until two or
three men piled on top of him.

BLACK, Halfback

Jack Black's brother is well on the road

Tom is the third Wildeat end. With
Nappy and ’Lias on the flanks he had a hard

His red-headed pep is his biggest asset.
