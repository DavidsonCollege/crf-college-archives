On Polls And Polls

We urge the approval of the pend-
ing amendment in next week's refer-
endum to lessen the penalty for vio-
lation of the student body drinking
rule.

For one reason, even the faculty
ruling has the catch-all term “ordi-
narily” which permits some leeway in
the questions that arise in this area.

Moreover, it is definitely in the best
interests of the student body that
such a change be brought about.
Shifting standards and attitudes on
the question of alcohol as shown in
the debates before last week's abor-
tive referendum give more reason for
a change in the punishment under
this regulation. ;

We do question the haste in pre-
senting this matter before the student
body in such an unorthodox manner.
Holding the referendum on a reading
day before examinations smirks of the
hasty moves by which the infamous
Speaker Ban law was adopted by the
North Carolina General Assembly two
years ago.

Stretching the rules in this ques-
tion, however, may bring about some
sensible change.

The second question to face stu-
dents in next week’s voting is one of
the most asinine moves ever pulled
before the Student Council. Clearly

the Student Body Constitution is
nothing to play spring games with,
no matter what the time of year.

We wonder how students can ex-
press in one breath their res onsible
attitudes on campus, yet in the next
minute turn to such immature acts as
making mockery out of the constitu-
tional amendment process.

Perhaps the jesting draws a few
loud guffaws; nevertheless, anything
other than a resounding defeat of this
bathetic proposal will bring numerous
questions concerning any future re-
quests based on responsible student
opinion and action.

The compilation of statistics from
yesterday’s opinion poll should be
only the first step in the Student
Council’s attempt to bring about a
satisfactory answer to the question
of alcohol on the Davidson campus.

As we stated in this column last
week, such a poll should show student
feeling on the distinct issues which
have arisen concerning this problem.

We are confident that the council
can use the findings of this poll to its
advantage as the members delve into
the ramifications of such a question,
and we trust that the council will
carefully examine every detail before
revealing its answer.

Herberg

The presence on campus earlier
this week of Dr. Will Herberg was a
stimulating and. thought - provoking
period.

Looking like another Burl Ives, the
noted philosopher in his lectures,
candid discussions and off-the-cuff
remarks was very much a part of the
Davidson community during his few
days here.

Perhaps the measure of a speaker’s
appeal to the student body can be
seen in the following. he leads to the
after-chapel coffee hour in the Union,
and in this Herberg succeeded magni-
ficently.

The Reynolds Lectureship Commit-
tee is to be congratulated again on
the succession of distinguished
scholars which have visited the cam-
pus under the Reynolds sponsorship.

‘He Was Part Of Davidson’

By DONALD DAVIS
Davidsonian Assistant Editor
When Dr. A. V. Goldiere, pro-

fessor emeritus of French, pass-
ed away suddenly May 5, many
members of the Davidson com-
munity felt they had lost more
than a neighbor or former pro-
fessor.

Mrs. Guy Vowles, widow of
_the late Dr. Guy Vowles, pro-
fessor emeritus of German, com-
mented, “We always felt that
we could Jean on him.

“He was one of the first per-
sons Dr. Vowles and I got to
know when we came to David-
son in 1925. He did so many good
things and many of the things
he did he didn't tell about.”

Gold‘ere was a native of Bos-
ton, Mass. and was graduated
from Dartmouth. He was doing
graduate work at Yale when he
interrupted his studies to come
to Davidson in 1922 on a one-
year contract.

He remained at Davidson. ex-
cept for two years during World
War II, until his retirement in
1963. During this time Goldiere
earned his MA and PhD from
Yale University.

Goldiere’s main academic in-
terest had been Latin until he
served in France with the U.S.

antl

er

Ambulance Service during World
War I. He remained at the Uni-
versity of Caen where his inter-
est shifted to French,’ He was
promoted to professor of French
at Davidson in 1937.

A member of the Davidson
Presbyterian Church, Goldiere
was an Elder, a member of the
Board of Deacons, and past Sun-
day School Superintednent. He
was also a past-president of the
Men of the Church and past vice
president of the Men of the
Church of the Concord Presby-
tery.

Goldiere was a member of the
Davidson Lions Club of which
he was past-president. He was
a past-zone chairman and past-
District Governor of Lions In-
ternational and an International
Counselor.

Goldiere was Past Master of
Mason’s Mecklenburg Lodge 176.
According to Dr. E. A. Beaty,
professor of Latin and German,
‘He was very active in the Ma-
sons and he was interested in
and worked with the Masonic
Orphanage (in Oxford).

Beaty continued, ‘’He was very
good to his neighbors and help-
ed them get out to lectures and
things which they normally
wouldn't have a chance to at-

3

3

tend. He loved flowers and spent
a: great deal of time garden-
ing.”

According to Dr. George B.
Watts, professor emeritus of
French, ‘‘He and I used to coach
and put on French plays. We
traveled to about all of the
schools in this area doing this.
We worked closely together in
such extra-curricular activities.”

Goldiere was a member of the
American Association of Teach-
ers of French and Spanish and
the South Atlantic Modern Lan-
guage Association.

Commenting on Goldiere’s in-
terest in the college, Mrs. Nan-
cy Blackwell, secretary in the
Alumni office said, ‘He always
came by on Saturday morning
to take THE DAVIDSONIAN
around to all the widows of late
faculty members.

**He was much a part of Da-
vidson.”

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Patterson Backs Council

Dear Editor:

The posters placed around
campus last week to publicize
the voluntary chapel and Open
End were made with poor judge-
ment and equally poor taste.

The intimation that the en-
tire student body has been ‘‘sold
down the river” by the Student
Council is childish and errone-

ous. The fact that the referen-.

dum failed to pass shows that
the. Council is not betraying the
wishes of the student body.
When I voted for the referen-
dum, I voted my willingness to
see this campus become wet,
but mainly I cast my vote in
favor of increased student free-
dom and abolishment of archaic
restrictions. Surely the major-
ity of the Council and some stu-
dents want to move forward in
these areas. What the Council
is trying to do is bridge the wid-
ening gap between faculty and
students and prevent this from
becoming an all-out war.

Certainly, the Council is sup-
posed to represent the best in-
terests of all students and not
merely be a pacifying group.
However, in Tim Kimrey’s ex-
cellent column on Davidson as
it is, one of his chief criticisms
is the lack of direction about
this place.

How in blazes can a trolka,
with separate outlooks and mo-
tivations, go anywhere but in
three different directions unless
there is an overall leader? Lead-
ership of the kind we want is
certainly not going to come
from either of the other horses,
so why not be the leader our-
selves? We can, and we are, but
we can’t ignore the rest of the
team without having them balk
and try to turn around. Get be-
hind the Council, then show the
faculty and trustees what we
want. ,

This student body is slowly
becoming aware of itself: (force-
wise at least); we are not going
to be denied much longer. First
we will have to be sure our
leadership is going in the direc-
tion to bring us liberty and not
merely license. Then our lead-
ers, hopefully the Council, should
announce that we are ready to
talk (openly) but not to bargain
for half a share any longer.
Then, if we are ignored or not
taken seriously, I'll be ready to
start looking for wicks for the
Molotov Cocktails.

But now, Baby, we've got to
move beyond the bitching stage
before anyone takes us serious-
ly, ourselves included. Let’s be-
gin by at least identifying with
those men we elected a month
or so ago to be our leaders but
certainly not to man our battle-
ments alone. Let's not just cas-
tigate them when most of us
don’t even know who they are.

Dear Editor:

During the past few weeks, I
have made visits to each of the
twelve fraternity houses for a
meal and a consequent discus-
sion. After some of the stories
I had heard about these citadels
of anti-intellectualism, I felt it
was truly dangerous for anyone,
especially ar Independent, to
venture past the laundry. But
being of missionary spirit, I did
with much prayer, make my

way to each of the lawless
lodges.

1 could not believe that I was
actually issued silverware and a
napkin when I was invited to
sit with the beastly brotherhood.
1 expected a food fight to erupt
at any moment, but contrary to
all the tales I'd heard, I saw not
a one. In many houses I even
saw reproductions of fine art
works hanging about the living
rooms. (Artificial pearls cast be-
fore real swine?)

A few houses had even thrown
a few albums of light classics
around on the tops of their ste-
reos just to impress me. It was
not at all unusual to see the
frattie-brothers crawling down
into their dens just to watch
Huntley-Brinkley when they had
finished their meals.

I'l] be the last to say that
“there ain't no flies on the fra-
ternity court.” Why, I heard
folks talking about art movies,
chemistry reviews, birth control,
and Viet Nam. Once at one of
the more “‘pitiful’’ houses some-
one even broke out a chess
board.

One by one my prejudices

‘about the fraternities crumbled.

I began to think that these great
anti-intellectuals, these brow-
beating conformists, these so-
cial. punks just might be people:
people in need of companionship.
(Perhaps they just haven't heard
about the social companionship
and. adventure available through
“community."” That’s all right.
Community has been legislated
out of existence at Davidson.)

I began to think that there is
more anti-intellectualism on the
court than anywhere else, sim-
ply because there are more peo-
ple there, and that anti-intel-
lectualism is all over this cam-
pus.

And so I wish to thank each
and every fraternity man at Da-
vidson for allowing me to visit
with him in his house, and come
to better understand the frater-
nity system and the fraternity
mentality.

Dougherty

Dear Editor:

In the May 14, 1965 issue of
THE DAVIDSONIAN, Mr. B. A.
Aiken “‘attacked’’ compulsory
ROTC here at Davidson. In at-
tempting to show that ROTC vi-
olates all the laws of God, re-
ligion in general, and the “hu-
man instincts” of man, Mr. Ai-
ken made a number of mis-
takes.

He postulated biased opinion
as truth: he stated as fact that
which is untrue: he used gener-
alities more wildly than is al-
lowable: and, worst of all, he
misquoted the Catalogue. Errors
such as these rendered invalid
the great majority of his irre-
sponsible, ‘‘shoot from the hip”
assertions.

While Davidson's primary pur-
pose is ‘“‘to develop man of hu-
mane instincts, of disciplined
and creative minds, and of
Christian character,”’ the Cata-
logue goes on to add “for full
lives of leadership, of service,
and of self-fulfillment.""—words
Mr. Aiken deleted. The words
“disciplined”, ‘leadership’, and
“service” are the keys to the
controversy.

There is not one course here,

with the exception of ROTC,
which teaches either practical
leadership or discipline. Further-
more, ROTC is the only course
besides those of the sociology
department which teaches “’serv-
ice’,

‘As for the “‘tactics of organ-
ized killing’, perhaps Mr. Aiken
would rather have seen the U.S.
submit to Nazi Germany in 1944,
to Japan in 1941, or to Russia,
the Viet-Cong, or Red China to-
day. The freedoms which you
enjoy. Mr. Aiken, must be pre-
served by someone, and ROTC
teaches the‘methods which we
may use (at the proper time)
to do so. j

By giving practical instruc-
tion in the preservation of free-
dom, ROTC seeks to liberate
men physically, mentally, and
spiritually. Compulsory academ-
ic courses and church attend-
ance are possible only in a so-
ciety whose members are free
physically, mentally, and spir-
itually. Instruction in freedom
and its methods of preservation
is as basic as any academic or
religious exercise.

Mr. Aiken naturally assumed,
with obvious bias, that ROTC
does not contribute time or op-
portunity for “‘creative’ schol-
arship. He must realize, how-
ever, that the amount of good
one derives from any course is
directly proportional to the work
put into it.

Davidson is ‘a Christian lib-
eral arts college dedicated to the
service of God and man."’ ROTC
serves men by helping them to
remain free; such a course can-
not be a flaw in the curriculum,
but only a valuable part of it.

ROTC, certainly, needs im-
provement; parts of the course
are uninteresting, ineffective, or
wrongly emphasized. But ROTC
as a requirement deserves re-
tention, for it is the only course
which teaches practical leader-
ship, discipline, and service.

Dear Editor:

“Amendments to this Consti-
tution shall be proposed as fol-
lows: by a written petition of

Body to the Student Council...

In this sort of atmosphere the
important exercise of a demo-
cratic privilege can easily be-
come a joke, Shouting about stu-
dent’ responsibility and signing
a scrap of paper which means
nothing seem to cause no con-
flict of ideals. It is conceivable
and highly possible that fifty
students, ably abetted by stu-
dent apathy and poor chapel at-
tendance, could railroad through
an amendment making the wear-
ing of socks an honor violation.
(No, you militant vespers moni-
tors, the Constitution does not
now require us to wear socks.)

Davidson is known among
girls’ schools in the area aS a
cesspool of immaturity. But im-
maturity is little excuse for ir-
responsibility.

Impeachment Incites GOP Feud

Noah

Dear Editor:

As one of the founders of the
Davidson College Young Repub.
lican Club. may I say that I
am quite proud of the fact that
we saw a need for this club and
that we did get it organized.
This club was founded on the
great principles of the Repub-
lican Party and should be one
of the ardent supporters of the
constitution of the Republican
Party of North Carolina.

However. the events that oc-.
curred in the Winston Salem Col-
lege Council Convention, make
me declare that the present Da-
vidson Club certainly has chang-
ed from its original purpose and
intent.

The Davidson delegation, led

" by Hugh J. Beard, aligned itself

_. ___._ DR. A. V. GOLDIERE

“Se Many Geod Things He

Didn't Tell About’

with the faction attempting to
oust John Patton, Chairman of
the Executive Committee of the
Young Republican College Coun-
cil of North Carolina. This fac-
tion (including Beard) put Pat-
ton in office because they felt
they could control Patton and
use him for their own purpose
but now they claim Patton to be
a member of a small liberal
group.

This I, along with other known
conservatives, deny and declare

that Patton is being subjected
to indictment for the sole pur-
pose of furthering personal in-
terests of the group making the
charges. Patton is exercising his
office for the support of the con-
servative Republican Party as
outlined in the Republican Con-
stitution.

It is my sincere hope and de-
sire that all the good Repub-
licans of Davidson College will
stand up and be counted so that
the Davidson Club will again
stand for the principles of the
Republican Party. The only way
for this to be accomplished is
for the Republicans in the stu-
dent body to join together and
reject the leadership of both
Beard and the others of the Club
who are using the Club for per-
sonal glory and gain.

Larry Noah
Charlotte, N. ¢.

McMullen

Dear Editor:

Last summer Larry Noah was
one of the founders of the Young
Republican Club here and his
activity and enthusiasm were in-
valuable aids in the develop-
ment of the club. All were proud
to have him as one of the club
officers while he attended Da-
vidson.

Unfortunately, Larry bas made

rather serious accusations bas-
ed, I believe, on inaccurate in-
formation. Not being present at
the convention two weeks ago,
he did not have the opportunity
to learn the facts.

As I understand his argument,
he suggests the following: The
Davidson delegation, led by
Hugh J. Beard, Jr., at the Col-
lege Council Convention, con-
demned Mr. John R. Patton. In
so doing, it violated the princi-
ples of the Republican Party
and is therefore unrepresenta-
tive of the club. Its leadership,
“using the club for personal glo-
ry and gain‘, should be reject-
ed.

In regard to the first charge,
Joe Beard hardly led the dele-
gation. for. being an officer of
the College Council, he enjoyed
special status and was not tech-
nically a part of the club dele-
gation, Moreover, the delega-
tion at no time voted to con-
demn Mr. Patton, there being
no opportunity for condemnation
or commendation at the conven-
tion.

Indeed, Mr. Patton's impeach.
ment is the subject of Larry's
letter. He was impeached not by
the convention but by the Exec-
utive Committee after the ad-
journment of the convention, on
five counts, the essence of which
was Mr. Patton's disruptive in-

fluence upon the College Coun-
cil. Therefore the impeachment
was not because of a difference
in political ideology.

In regard to the charge of
an anti-Patton ‘“‘faction,"’ I re-
fer those interested to the ‘‘fac-
tion’ consisting of eighty per
cent of the Executive Commit-
tee which rejected Mr. Patton's
leadership.

Beard

Dear Editor:

Mr. Noah has made several
serious allegations concerning
the motives of myself and the
other members of the College
Council Executive Committee in
impeaching Mr. John R. Patton
of Wake Forest College, the
present chairman.

There has been no College
Council Chairman to my knowl-
edge who has done as much to
divide the Republican Party in
this state, or who has threat-
ened to do as much more, as
has John Patton. Mr. Patton has
repeatedly removed officers
whose only fault was a disin-
clination to obey John Patton to
the detriment of the Republican
Party.

O

nce More
With Feeling

By TIM KIMREY

Somehow two weeks worth of criticism, some ex-

tremely valid

and some sadly inane, and two weeks of

daily contemplation about Davidson College have reduced

me to a person very weary

This usually glib college senior is having
am now pictured, so I

time finding words. I

of controversy and caring.

a difficult
ear, as the

bitter bitch in the ivory tower—the frustrated, blind-to-
good senior who has fired a shotgun blast from the van-

tage point of looking

through his own navel.

Maybe so. But I would here offer my apology (justifi-
cation) and projection on the theme presented two weeks
ago. I ask the reader’s indulgence of what must of neces-

sity be a rather personal approach.

In the first place, the title of
this column should not be over-
looked as nothing more than a
catchy phrase. It was chosen
deliberately to denote the tone
of all that I have had to say un-
der it. There has never been
any pretense of perfect ration-
alism or logical regularity, This
was. and is now, a column of
feeling, of opinion, if that term
suits you better. What I have
written, be it about race, love,
or Davidson, has been written
through the eyes of an admitted-
ly emotional observer. And I
would ask that this not be dis-
counted as a valid form of ex-
pression of opinion about issues
as well as people and relation-
ships.

In the second place, I would
offer that the bitterness tag
should be replaced with one of
sadness. The end of the road is
always the moment of looking
back, in this case upon four
years and $10,000 worth of col-
lege experience. To shallow crit-
ics like Mr. Moye, I would an-
swer that I do see many things
good about Davidson College,
many liberalizations and some
progress.

But in that look back, I also
see many things missed, manv
opportunities never presented,
many roadblocks set up by tra-
dition-worship and many goals
never sought. I have missed a
great deal, and that is why the
look back is a sad one.

Obviously, the blame does not
lie solely with the college. I ac-
cept with absolutely no pride the
judgement of laziness and lack
of discipline; I hope that each
of us accepts that judgement.

But I do blame the college for
restricting my sphere of educa-
tion; I do blame the college for
offering a curriculum so weak
in vital areas that no man can
truly be said to have received a
liberal education here: and I do
blame the college for being sat-
isfied with many faculty mem-
bers who have either no desire
to inspire students to learn or
no ability to do so.

Every year Davidson College
inherits 250 men with minds
ready to be trained in the art
and practice of seeking knowl-
edge. These are golden years—
years in which men are made
real or childhoods made perma-
nent. How many, how many of
us have become children and
left worthless? How many have
never been stirred into an in-
tensity about learning? How
many of us ever really gave a
damn?

The answers to these ques-
tions have destroyed my belief
in the image of Davidson Col-
lege.

To you who have sat in your
own ivory towers and screamed
for ‘constructive criticism’’ I of-
fer the following suggestions for
tomorrow's Davidson College,
which, they tell me, is not real-
ly going to die after all. Such
measures are frankly idealistic,
costly and against the grain of
Davidson's tradition.

1) As a step toward ending
the damnable grade-seeking, I
would hope that the grading sys-
tem could be changed to: “A”
for excellence, ‘‘B’’ for satisfac-
tory completion of course re-
quirements, ‘“F’’ for failure to

From those who were not re-
movable by him, Mr. Patton has
demanded obedience, threaten-
ing political extinction to any
who opposed him. In his drive
for personal power, Mr. Patton
has suggested that several col-
ieges should withdraw from the
College Council and establish
their own ‘College Council’’ in
opposition to the regular organi-
zation. Because of these disrup-
tive actions by Mr. Patton, the
Executive Committee impeach-
ed him.

Despite the allegations by Mr.
Noah to the contrary, it has
been my purpose in my activi-
ties in the Young Republicans
to advance those principles of
limited government and individ-
ual liberty which have so long
been the cornerstone of the Re-
publican Party, not to obtain
“personal glory and gain’. I
have never deviated from this
purpose nor do I intend to do so
in the future.

complete minimum _require-
ments. I would also call | for
comprehensive examinations ‘at
the end of the sophomore and
senior years.

2) Drop ail requirements for
class attendance, thus freeing
the student from worthless lec-
tures and posing an incentive for
professors to strive to ‘draw’
students with stimulating lec-
tures.

3) For reasons abundantly
and accurately stated in the ma-
jority report of the Fraternity
Evaluation Committee, the. so-
cial ‘system centering around
exclusive national fraternities
should be replaced with an open
system based on a small group
social] life, either dormitory or
eating-club.

4) I would favor making Da-
vidson co-educational or con-
structing a separate girls’ school
to be run in conjunction with
the men's college. Reasons
should be obvious.

5) Eliminate all two-to-a-room
dormitory housing and establish
single room suites, which would
also serve as an ideal social
unit.

6) If, and only if, suggestions
4) and 5) are implemented, I
would favor permitting con-
sumption of alcoholic beverages
in the dorms and allowing la-
dies in the dorms at certain
hours.

7) 1 would urge a change in
the attitude of the admissions
policy of the college. Such a
change would involve actively
seeking qualified Negro students
—with the end in mind of creat-.
ing a strong minority group on
the campus. We should also
strive toward a more cosmo-
politan student body, containing
more Jews and Catholics. South-
erners need to experience living
with Negroes, Jews and Cath-
olics.

8) Relationship with the Pres-
byterian Church should be main-
tained, even strengthened, with
the idea in mind that the col-
lege could serve the church by
channeling to it ideas and move-
ments in the academic world.

8) Required vespers should be
abolished. Required attendance
at a specified number of cul-
tural events should replace re-
quired chapel.

10) The departments of sociol-
ogy and political science should
be greatly strengthened.

11) There should be an in-
creased effort to relate David-
son students to the ‘outside
world’ through a wider variety
of lectureships, panels, “‘teach-
ins,” etc. Drop all barriers; be
afraid of no opinion or philos-
ophy.

12) Finally, I would reiterate
my hope that Davidson College
can, in the future, look to the
offices of the President and the
Dean of the Faculty for dynam-
ic and imaginative leadership.

In a word, there is in the
South a great need for a small
liberal arts college which can
serve to nurture and sustain
the embryonic liberal tradition
which has arisen in the South
during the past decade. David-
son College should be that col-
lege: there is no other. But Da-
vidson today cannot offer that
leadership: it cannot lend
strength to the liberal tradition
that may eventually pull the
South out of its past. Not until
Davidson forgets its tradition,
its own past glory, and moves
ahead dynamically and with vi-
sion, not until then will David-
son College deserve to be called
a ‘truly fine liberal arts col-
lege.

As I leave Davidson and the
South, I am filled with love for
neither, but hope for both. Some
say they deserve each other. I
say they need each other.
