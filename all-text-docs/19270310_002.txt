Dull Sport Season

Baseball Again |

Although hampered tremendously by the |
recent mammoth snow, athletic teams might |
be said to be progressing with the same |
rapidity as last week and the week before. |
Only that several branches of sports have
disbanded and tucked away uniforms and
other paraphernalia until 12 moons have

passed away and this journal again heralds |

the close of a “successful season.” But the
writer of this bunkum in 1928 will shy away
from all such ideas as the total absence of
dope for this space-filler at this time of the
yea is appalling.

Several times this year we have been on
the verge of allowing the poor readers of
The Davidsonian rest from such vain ac-
cusations as dribble from a_ second-hand
typewriter. We realize that every one knows
Captain So and So led his team to a stu-
pendous victory over a vastly superior ag-
gregation and that even the lowly Fresh un-
derstand the cinder path artists are perfom-
ring admirably ad infiitum. Be that
may be!

One item of unusual interest has come to |

” our notice within the week, however. Grier
Davis, 138 pound class wrestler, tells the
following true story. Davis weighed in for
the Duke wrestling match on a Friday and
he tipped the scales at 136 1-2. One week
later, last Friday, after he had been _off
taining only four days, the same scales, un-
der the same conditions as: prescribed before,
showed Davis as being exactly 155 pounds
light. Some record, we call it, or some scales,
maybe! ~ :

According to a prominent North Carolina
daily, Tom Anderson, retiring baskethall
captain, is rated on the second team on its
all-state fives. He is the only Davidson man
mentioned in the write-up. If it is not a

mite speaking to a Hercules, we would say

| Seven Men Awarded Numerals—
Many Good Men Lost by
Graduation

Letters have been awarded to members of
| the two varsity teams in basketball and
wrestling, the seasons of these sports having
| recently been brought to a close. Mono-
| grams have been given to members of the
| Freshman basketball team, Letters in var-
| sity basketball went to:' Captain Anderson,
| McAuley, Calhoun, Wilson, Harrison, Simp-
/son, Hudgins, and Manager Carrol.
The forwards, McAuley, Harrison
| Calhoun, made a shifty combination.

| Auley, in the opening games, was a flash, and
|his running up of points was the deciding
factor in several hard fought affairs. Har-
| rison, the fastest, proved to be a demon of
speed in getting the jump on his opponents.

Droopy Hudgins performed in the role
| of stellar substitute, and won his letter in
| this capacity.
| The wrestlers who received letters were:
Captain Frierson, Hill, Crinkley, Davis, Es-
tridge, Flythe and Garris&n.

Captain Frierson continued the splendid
record he has set since his first year and
experienced a most successful season.

Hill, a Sophomore, proved to be the find
of the year, showing up well in the heavy-
weight class.

_The veterans Crinkley and Estridge worl-
ed well in all their matches, as did Flythe,
another Sophomore.

Davis and Garrison distinguished ‘them-
selves in gruelling matches, with men far |
above their weight. ’

Grapplers Win Only One Match
During Hectic Year—High
Spot Against West Point

The varsity wrestling season, though not
so successful as it might have been, contain-
ed some excellent matches, and some of the
members of the team showed some excep-
tional form, The team had six matches and
lost all but one of these, winning from Con-
cord by the overwhelming score of 40 to 3.

The first match of the season was with

State here on January 15th. The match was |

very interesting as is shown by the close
score, 15 to 12, The Davidson grapplers
showed unusual form, and fought with the
true Wildcat spirit, but were not able to
overcome the strong State team.

The next match was with Concord, the
Wildcats coming out on the long end of a
40 to 3 score. The Davidson team met the
Concord grapplers several times during the
year, and won from them each time, in most
instances by a large score.

The big match with the Army was the
third match of the season. The Wildcats
went to West Point, and met the strong
Army team on the 5th of February. The
local wrestlers showed good form in this
match, and held the Army grapplers to a 6
to 15 score.

matches by a fall, while Pritchett won his

fied.

GARRISON NAMED

P. J. Garrison, of Covington, Ga.,
was elected captain of next year’s
wrestling team at a meeting of letter
men as the grapplers returned from
the closing: match of the season against
Carolina last week. Garrison has been
one of the outstanding men on the
wrestling squad during the season just
closed and bids fair to make an excel-
lent leader in 1928. He ordinarily
wrestles in the 148 pound class, but
due to Davidson's shortage of heavy
men, he has frequently been placed in
the heavyweight class, at times pitted
against men 30 pounds heavier.

‘Davidson Wrestlers End
Season by Losing Match
to Tar Heel Grapplers

Captain Frierson Gains Victory in
| His Match—No Falls Registered
| During Evening

The Davidson wrestling team, winning the
first bout of the evening when Captain
Frierson scored a time decision over Fuzzell,
fell easy victims to the University of North
Carolina wrestlers in Chapel Hill on Feb-
ruary 28th by the one-sided score of 20-3,
the Carolina matmen taking each succeeding
match.

This engagement marked the end of Da-
vidson’s season and the last inter-collegiate
game for Frierson, Wildcat leader, who
closed his term as captain with no losses,
he also bringing to a close three years of
service for Davidson, during which time one
defeat and one draw were chalked up against
his otherwise perfect record.

The hardest fought match of the encounter
was in the 148 pound class, Gardner, of
Carolina, getting a time decision on Es-
tridge, of Davidson, after a hard session on
the canvass. By winning his match Gardner,
like Captain Frierson, finished his collegiate
season without a defeat. Garrison, wrestling
Carolina's captain, Warren, in the 175 pound
class and being outweighed 26 pounds, put
up a plucky fight only to lose by a time de-
cision. Montsinger, Carolina, scored
the only fall of the evening when Flythe,
after stubborn resistance, gave under. Each
