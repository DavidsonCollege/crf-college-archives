Spring season underway for Wildcat golf

By Davip MoncurE
Staff Writer

The Wildcat golf team kicked off the
spring season with a stellar performance at
the William and Mary Invitational March 5-
7. The team finished sixth overall out of a
field of 24 teams.

Captain Aaron Watt recorded the team’s
best score and finished fifth overall in the
individual competition.

“Aaron was a huge part of our team
unity,” Scott Shupe said. “He led the new
players and helped the team finish strong.”

The following week the Wildcats hosted
the Birkdale Collegiate Golf Classic March
10-12. Largely because of the extreme winds
and rain-shortened second round, the team
did not perform as well as they had in
Williamsburg.

“The competition has been extremely
strong,” head coach Joe Mark said. “We have

played against many nationally ranked teams,
but the guys like tough competition to im-
prove their game.’

On March 16, the Wildcat golfers headed
to South Carolina to compete in the East
Carolina Invitational, finishing 16th after
two rounds of competition, including a sec-
ond round in which the team shot 312.

“On the first day we showed our capa-
bilities, and we showed we can play with
anyone,” said Shupe. “On. the second day,
though, we just lost it mentally. We just need
to stay focused mentally and realize we can
play with any school.” °

“In the first round we shot 292, which
was one of our best scores in a while,” said
Mark. “On the second day, the wind picked
up and we did not play as well.”

One of the highlights of the East Caro-
lina tournament was Frank Walker’s hole-in-
one in the first round.

- The biggest thing on the golfers’ mind as far

as the rest of the spring goes is the Southern
Conference Tournament April 20-23 in Lex-
ington, Va. For the first time ever, the winner
of the tournament will receive an automatic
bid into the NCAA tournament.

Mark’s hopes for the tournament rest on

the team’s consistency. “All the golfers are
very capable of shooting low numbers, and
with some consistency we will post better
scores. We just need-to finish strong.”
Sean Davidson remarked, “We have played
real tough competition so far,” Sean Davidson
said. “And we are showing a lot of promise.”
“We want everyone to peak at the conference
tournament,” added Watt. “We have had one
guy hitting the ball well at each tournament
this spring, so we just need to get everyone
consistent for this tournament.”
The Wildcats will play in one more tourna-
ment before the Southern Conference Tour-
nament—the Furman Invitational April 7-9
in Greenville, S.C.

Davidson’s senior shortstop and co-
captain Ben Brown will miss the next
four to six weeks of the baseball season
due to a broken fibula in his left leg.

Brown, a product of Charlotte Latin,
originally suffered the injury last Tues-
day when he was hit by a pitch in his
lower leg. While loosening up prior to

the game on Sunday, the bone snapped,
leaving Brown in a heap in the outfield
grass.

A career .317 hitter, Rian was -
enjoying perhaps his best season.
Through 28 games, he was hitting .349
and had scored 34 runs as the team’s
lead-off hitter. Earlier in the week, he
had hit homers in consecutive games,
doubling his career total. He was among
the conference leaders in stolen bases

- with 20 and walks with 22. In the field,
he was the ‘Cats steadiest performer,
committing just six errors at short fora
fielding percentage of .952.

Brown was on pace to break numer-
‘ous career records, including hits (needs
15) and stolen bases (needs five). He had
played in a school-record 180 consecu-
tive games. The game on Sunday against
UNC Greensboro was the first he had
missed in his four seasons at Davidson.

“We will miss Ben’s leadership on
the field and his ability to get on base at
the top of the lineup,” said Head Coach
Dick Cooke. “It’s a shame that he will
have to sit and watch after all he’s done
for this team. But we look forward to
having him back for the Southern Con-
ference Tournament in May.”

The Wildcats are off to their best
start in eight years with an overall record
of 16-13 and conference mark of 8-7.

With a speedy recovery, Brown still
might have achance to break some school
records. More importantly, Davidson
needs Brown on the field to help the
