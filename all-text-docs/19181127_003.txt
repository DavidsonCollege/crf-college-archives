GLEE CLUB TRIPS
ARE BEING PLANNED

The Glee Club this year, tho working
under difficulties, has shaped up some
good material. It has some good singers:
and besides these, it embraces the Man-
dolin Club. At the concert given on
the night of the Washington and Lee-
Davidson game, the Mandolin Club
scored a tremendous hit. Many are the
resources of the Glee Club, among the
most notable of which are a “nigger
preacher” and a “nigger” mouth-harp
expert. These men, Shields and Cathey,
are truly artists in their line; and they
have, and undoubtedly will continue to
draw down their full share of laughter
and applause.

If practice makes perfect, the Glee
Club ought to make “a howling success.’
Most any time. if you happen to be pass-
ing Shearer Hall, you can hear them
singing—‘“For every hour of sorrow
you've had—’’ “Nor the socks of sister’s
that raise the bloomin’ blisters—” and
other popular hits.

It is uncertain now when and where
the club will make its trips. However,
one to Gastonia on November 30 is be-
ing planned. After this the club expects
to take a trip to Statesville, December 7.
There are also the possibilities of a big
trip to Winthrop and other colleges.

C. F. Allen. ex’19, who is attending
Columbia Seminary, was on the Hill
Sunday. He reports that much progress
has been made at the seminary since the
resumtpion of work after the “flu”
quarantine.

The DAVIDSONIAN. November 27, 1918

With the Alumni |

The following lines are from a letter
from Lt. Chas, D. Vlontgumery, ‘09,
who is “over there” with the Amezican
forces:

“If vou could see some of the more
tangible eviderwes of what this war is
and the work of our army over here
you would be inspired by some things.
touched by others. You would be proud
of the long, long columns of troops, the
numberless wagon and auto truck trains,
the great dumps of ammunition, the hos-
pitals and arbulances, all the aerial serv-
ice, and all the other things that go to
make up a modern army. You would
gloat over the long columns of grav-clad
prisoners to be seen moving along the
roads to the rear. And you would be
touched to see people returning to homes
they had not seen for years, and to hear
church bells ringing that have héen silent
since 1914."

Capt. J. W. Moore, ‘12, hasbeen re-
turned from France to Camp | Meade,
Md. Captain Moore entered the army
in the fall of 1917 without previous mili-
tary training. He is one of the David:
son men who have risen to high positions
in the army through sterling worth.

lar meeting on last Friday afternoon].

with Mrs. W. R. Grey. The topic was
“Paris and Versailles.” Miss Hattie
Thompson read a very interesting pa-
per on “Paris.” This was followed by

buckle. This was especially interesting
because of the great peace conference
which is being held at Versailles today.
The visitors were Mesdames Orinond,
Miley and Mrs, Murray Grev. After
the literary program was completed de-
lightful refreshments were served.

boss came in. and heard their order and
then said: “T don't want to Russia. but

mies went away Hungary. (Phew!)—
