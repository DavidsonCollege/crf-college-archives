Cummings Leave India
After Year Of Teaching

After a year of teaching
in India and Japan, Dr. Wil-
liam P. Cumming has re-
turned to the Davidson Eng-
lish Department. His year
included such varied experi-
ences as tea with a mahara-
jah in a white marble
palace, an interview with
Nehru, being in a crossfire
between Viet Cong guerillas
and a Vietnamese gunboat
on the Mekong River, and
revisiting his own birthplace
in Japan.

Dr. Cumming was appointed

- by the United States Depart-
ment of State as Fulbright Lec-
turer in English at Annamalai
“University in Madras State,
South ‘India, 150 miles south
of the city of Madras and 11
degrees north of the equator.

The university, which num-
bers 53000 men and 340 women
students. between whom there
was no social communication,
named Dr. Cumming Visiting
Professor of English and Amer-
ican Literature.

Mrs. Cumming, who holds
her master’s degree from Ox-
ford University and has taught
at Smith College in Massachu-
setts and at Queens College in
Charlotte, was given a travel
grant by the Fulbright Commis-
sion.

She was appointed Visiting
Professor of English at An
namalai University. There she
taught American literature to
graduates and headed the first
Institute of Spoken English for
undergraduates in India.

At Annamalai University, the
Cummings experienced a world
of marked contrasts. Against
a background of primitivism
in the surrounding villages,
there were displays of excel-
lence in modern scientific and
cultural achievement.

While their mode of tran-
sporation was a two-wheeled
bullock cart, they lived among
colleagues who held degrees
and honors from all over the
western world. In the second
semester they will introduce
to Davidson one of their most

is smaller by 40; 24 are studying
this year in France or Ger-
many; 16 dropped out for other
reasons. ;

The class of 65 did not lose

tics do not allow for specia!
cases.

Information Service, chiefly
for the purpose of introducing
American Literature to India.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

A Letter From Rochester

(Editor’s note: Tim Kim-
rey was working in Roches-
ter, N Y., this past suminer
when the seemingly tranquil
city’s tensions boiled over in-
to the streets. He recorded
his impressions in a letter
to Rick Von Unwerth, a fra-
ternity brother. Both Kimrey
and von Unwerth serve as as-
soctate editors of THE
DAVIDSONIAN.)

Dear Rick,

Well, the Long Hot Summer
came to Rochester this week,
bringing with it all the anguish
and bitterness we had expect-
ed. As you know, Susan and I
have been working here all
summer in a predominantly
Negro slum, and I though you
might like to hear from some-
one who is not exactly proud
to be an “insider.”

If nothing else, writing this
brief epistle will provide me
an opportunity to air some of
my feeling on what these race
riots mean to Rochester and
to white America in general.

1 don't know what kind of
coverage the press down there
has given to this mess, So 1
hardly know where to begin
telling you about what has
been going on. The initial riot
started at a street dance last
Friday when a cop tried to
arrest a Negro youth who was

Lg little plastered. Within thirty

minutes the air was full of
bricks and the streets were
filled with cops and rioting
Negroes.

This went on all night over
on Joseph Avenue, which is in
the Seventh Ward, and it broke
out with twice the intensity
Saturday night down in the
Third Ward. These two areas
are the main Negro ghettos in
Rochester.

As you might expect, all of
Rochester was in a stir on
Saturday, and has been ever
since for that matter. It was
really a sight to see all the
so-called liberal members of

-lthe white power-structure run-

Twenty-Four New Faces

structor in biology, gone to the
mission field.

Jd. R. GROSS, instructor in
English, returning to graduate

ning around asking one another,
“How could this ever have
happened in Rochester?” To
most of the nation, Rochester
has enjoyed the repuation of
being God's Country as far
as race relations are concern-
ed.

And in comparion to Birming-
ham and Mississippi..this may
have been a valid claim. But
now this image is shattered —
much to the amazement of the
white citizenry. I really think
it’s a good damn thing this
happened in Rochester, if it
had to happen anywhere; it
really points out to all America
how far we have left the Negro
from freedom and happiness,
despite all our claims to the
contrary.

I have been able to see one
thing very clearly during this

time. And that is that the do.
good, benevolent white liberal
is almost as harmful as the out-
right segregationist, and much
more difficult to fight. So many
well-meaning whites think that
love and justice are the only
things the Negro has coming
to him, and they completely
overlook the most important
thing of all — power.

By power I do not mean
strength and the ability to
force, but simply the ability
to mo!d one’s own destiny and
to shape one’s own future. This
the Negro does not have, and
this hell will not cease until
he is able to stand in society
and say, “I am a man and.I am
free to make of myself the
greatest thing my abilities will
permit.” .

I never thought I would find

myself following Martin Luther
King on much of anything, but
this summer has really changed
me. That guy has really got a
lot of right ideas on power and
direct non-violent action and
the like. His book Why We
‘Can't Wait is so pointed and
so right. Please read it.

Moreover, this Southern
Chrizfian Leadership Confer-
ence, of which he is the head,
appears to me to be holding
all the high cards among the
various _civil-rights groups.
As the only Christian civil-rights
groups, they are able to deal
more effectively with the whole
man. And the basis of their
movement is love, and not re-
venge, aS so many white fear.
I'm afraid I’m really caught up
in the so-called Movement. It’s
great!

A few nights ago Susan and
I went to a big mass meeting
that some of the SCLC .boys
organized. Wé were with about
three other white people among
700 or so Negroes. Maybe this
sounds kinda silly, but right
at the end of the meeting they
all joined hands and sang “We |
Shall Overcome” and al] that.
And, Rick, [ don't think I have
ever been 50 embarrassed and
ashamed to be white. Hell, I
just wanted to crawl under a
seat somewhere.

J keep wondering where. love
has gone and if white men in
this freedom-loving country of
ours will ever recognize the
Negro as a human being. May-
be some day....

Hopefully,
Tim
