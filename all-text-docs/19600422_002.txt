Scripts ‘n' Pranks:

Split Personality?

The year’s final publication of
Script ‘n’ Pranks last Tuesday touch-
ed off a pair of sharply conflicting
critical estimates. One segment of
the student body maintained that this
was the best edition of the year—
others, however, complained that it
was the worst.

Judged purely on the basis of lit-
erary content and quality, the third
Scripts ‘n’ Pranks is the finest college
magazine that has been published
here in the last three or four years.
But it was not a humor magazine.
Readers looked in vain for the tradi-
tional Who's Nothing report; the pig-
gish picture story fell short of what-.
ever it was trying to accomplish; the
cartoons were unsubtly sick. ‘Scripts
‘n’ Pranks was a good magazine be-
cause of its short stories and poetry
—not because of its humor.

Part of the fault may lie with the
available talent. Davidson seems to
be woefully devoid of humorists in
‘the tradition Davis, Kernan and Cole.

On the other hand, the editors
must have been aware by now ‘that
the very nature of the magazine pre-
vents it from becoming completely
successful on either a purely literary
basis or purely from a humorous yiew-
point. Scripts ‘n’ Pranks begged for
contributions from faculty members,
but what professor wants to be pub-
lished in a magazine which, in the
past, has taken sly swipes at all Dav-
idson holds as dear and true? What
teacher wants his poem printed op-

posite a doctored photograph caption-
ed “Lust in the Sty’? The best cam-
pus poets and writers hesitate to sub-
mit their best work to a humor mag-
azine—but perhaps the best college
humorists are just as reluctant to con-
tribute their wit to a publication thaf
is trying its best to go highbrow.

Ideally, Davidson needs a literary
quarterly which would be published
separately from Seripts ‘n’ Pranks,
which was intended to be the college
humor magazine and should remain
so. Our intellectual stock would be
upped considerably if we could pro-
duce a literary magazine similar to
the Carolina Quarterly, the Duke Ar-
chive, or the Yale Review.

But this is an ambitious goal. The
college money handlers complain that
Scrips ‘n’ Pranks costs too much as
it is; it would be impractical to ex-
pand Davidson’s magazine produc-
‘tion.

We would therefore make a more
modest proposal: Increase the maga-
zine production to four a year instead
of three. Two of these would be pub-
lished under the Scripts ‘n’ Pranks
byline, and would contain only good,
pithy humor. The other two editions,
under different name and different
editorship, would be purely literary.

If the college is too shortsighted to
pay for more complete intellectual ex-
pression, perhaps the literary socie-
ties, Sigma Upsilon and student-fac-
ulty contributions could finance the
marginal cost.

A Challenge To The YMCA

The YMCA chapel Thursday brought
Paris fashions to mind. The styles
change every year. During the pres-
entation the ‘Y” paraded its new garb
for the coming year.

President Jim Richardson express-
ed his belief that the “Y” in the past
has tended to lose sight of its real
purpose. The result: the “Y” next
year will be the ymCa. The “Y's”
main purpose will be to “bring glory
to God through his son Jesus Christ.”

If the “Y” next year can bring a
renewed interest in religion on cam-
pus, it will have achieved a difficult
goal. We sincerely hope that the “Y”

will give its untiring efforts to this.

goal. We can think of no finer way
to “bring glory to God.”
Religion at present is “out.” It is

definitely noz cool. A real service will

be to show Christianity as being dy-

namic, challenging, and meaningful.

We must warn, however, that to ac-
complish any such goal the “Y’’ must
guard against becoming too narrow in
its approach. If a liberal education
does anything, it teaches one to be
open-minded and tolerant. The Church
has lost many followers because it
often fails to appear open-minded.

The “Y” must attempt to convey
its message in new and meaningful
ways. The Church has become so en-
tangled in its traditional methods and
its worn-out phrases that many feel
it has little to offer to modern day
society. We hope the “Y” will at-
tempt to communicate in modern
terms to our modern age. TBC

IN MEMORIAM
E. M. Crowson, printer, passed away last Wednesday
night in Davidson. We offer our most heartfelt con
dolences to his family send

friends.

A Plea For Purity

It is doubtless fitting at this time to
State the official DAVIDSONIAN po-
sition on Moral Uprightness, for
Spring Frolics is here, besetting us
on every side with evil: dimpled
temptresses, demon rum and the host
of dark forces.

And so we declare our unreserved
support of legitimate motherhood, the

_ Protestant ethic, racial purity, the
American flag and a Good Name for
the College.

We urge our readers to remember
the One Rule for Davidson students:
be gentlemen. And for those who find
this stricture vague, we note that
forty-seven pages of supplementary
reminders follow the One Rule in the
Red Book.

We admonish our readers to heed
the Red Book Stand on the Suppres-

sion of Spirits, which is certainly the-

most binding and potent rule of all,
having been not only passed but af-
firmed and re-affirmed by the faculty
in a striking display of rectitude.

We call upon ail right-thinking stu-
dents to be trustworthy, loyal, help-
ful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedi-
ent, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and
reverent, and we suggest that a hum-
ble and contrite spirit is a pretty good
thing, too, which never hurt anybody.

We remind our readers that David-
son is more than a college: it is a place
of Great Moral Force. And at David-
son, those who do not respond to
Force are severely dealt with.

Lastly, we give a word of caution
to all who might backslide or stumble
upon the narrow way: If you must go
to Hell, nlease do it outside the Three-
Mile Limit. ESD

GELDED STALLION

Don't expect too much; your

gelded by his environment. He's
unable to furnish the chivalrous
attention traditionally due you
in. Southern gyneolatry. Rather
it is you—as ego warmer—who
takes the offensive in appeasing
an insatiable self-centeredness.

Your date craves the notori-
ety that comes with excelling,
yet by-passes high-level involve-
ment for the shoddy ideal of
social prowess. Here is an area,
he thinks, where notoriety
comes cheap. But the price is
high—his ability and sensitivity
are sold down the river and his
imperviousness to high matters
poisons the academic atmos-
phere.

PROVING PERIOD

He’s a performer — behind
that determined misbchavior is

the agonizing desire to be ap-

plauded. The weekend is no
pastime; it’s a tense proving
period which makes gregarious:

And you’re the audience—a
captive audience, really—for if
his performance proves incom-
petent, the only recourse is to a

myriad of other, ever alike,
sideshows.
Sadly, even where involve-

ment is deepest, accomplish-
ment remains mediocre: there
are few uniquely colorful, uni-
quely coarse, uniquely shiftless
creatures at Davidson.

It’s been in the, library for twenty five years for

everyone to see.

The story begins with a group
of energetic, hard-working,
Presbyterian missionaries in
China in 1935. These fine folks
had a sentimental attachment
to Davidson College. They loy-
ed the institution for some of
them had spent their own days
at Davidson.

Along with this feeling of
devotion, the missionaries had
@ sense of respect for their
alma mater; they would not
have seid or done anything to
mar the fine, age.old tradi-
tion of “their” college.

In order to show their devo-
tion and respect for their alma
mater, the missionaries decided
to present Davidson a gift—
something that would stand as
a token of appreciation. “What
shall we present the college?”
they asked themselves. “‘Books?
A chair? Money?”

One missionary suggested
that they give the college e
rug. “Chine is famous for
hand-woven rugs,” he decler-
ed, “and it would fest for
years. And its something ev-
eryone should see. You HAVE
to notice something, if you
walk right across it.”

The next major concern was
to determine the nature of the
rug. “What design if any should
our rug have?” they asked. It

“ALENDA LUX UBI ORTA
LIBERTAS” (Let Learning Be
Cherished Where Liberty Has
Arisen).

The missionaries proceeded
to fulfill their plan. They in-
structed a poor, ignorant Chi-
nese weaver to make a rug with
the scal woven in its center.
They gave the old man a copy
of the seal which they had torn
from the pages of an old “Alum-
ni Journal.”

The old man had never
studied any Latin; the Arabic

letters seemed simple con-
psred to his own Mandarin
characters, but he. took pains
to do the job correctly. After
leboring long and hard, he
tied the fast knot and sunr-
moned the missionaries.

group to the weaver’s handi-
craft was one of satisfaction. It
was only after a more careful
scrutinization that a slight—a
very slight—error was detected.
The old weaver had miscopied
part of the motto from the seal;
he had enclosed the small! space
between the letters “L" and “I”
of the word “Libertas,” form-
ing the letter “U” in their
stead.

They knew that the rug
would have to be cut, and prob-
ably ruined, if the spelling were
changed. Thus, they decided to
ship their gift to the college
without attempting to correct
the mistake.

The rug arrived at the college.
Officials of the institution de-
cided that it would be only fit.
ting to place the rug, as the
missionaries had suggested, in
the center of learning, the li-
brary.

it was finally. decided that
the rug would be pleced in
the center of all centers of
erudition, the Davidsoniana
Room, where an outstanding
collection of learned and in-
tellectua! documents by Da-
vidson’s own sons had been
amassed.

“Certainly,” the officials
thought, “‘this 1s the only place
for the rug to lie. The motto .
“Let Learning Be Cherished
Where Liberty Has Arisen”’ will
have a deep significance in this
place.” :

And so the rug remains to
day in the library of Davidl-
son College. Occasionally one
(he’s probably a Latin scholar)
smiles or laughs to himsolf
as he passes the rug.

He realizes that the old Chi-
nese weaver did what would
happen only once in ten thous-
and times; he unknowingly
formed a gramatically correct,
third-declension, Latin word
“Ubertas” from the _ third-
declension “Libertas.” And, in

‘addition, the motto (as he al-

tered it) made sense.

Thus, the Latin scholar
smiles as he passes by the rug
in the central workshop of
the college—in the room that
houses the literary works of
Davidson's intellectual clite—
and (most ironically) at the
very crux of an all-male in-
stitution.

The Latin scholar laughs to
himself as he sees these words:

Tho general effect? A sort of

the-hell-with-it elegance.

He is the perfect dance week-

antiseptic confines of the cam-

pus, ready to forget momentar-
ily the burdensome academic
routine of sunbathing, horse-
shoes and gin rummy.

He smokes @ virile brand—
no Filter.

He worries sometime about
med school, but not very much.

He has mastered the bored
look, the careless smile, the
loose gait, the. cool idiom, and
at least four verses of the Hot
Nuts song.

He dates Converse girls, Sa-
lem girls, Hollins girls, Sweet-

briar girls, Randolph-Macon

The Righteous Man does not
leave the Frolics dances early
in the eveniig, as do the trans
gressors. He does not go up
the road, but he is careful not
to condemn—openly—those who
do.

He has laid aside his Sun-
day School attendance pin and
his pocket Testament, but
there is still about him an
uneraseable flush of piety
which identifies him as a fel-
low-fraveler in at least one
denominational fellowship.

At the after-parties he will
apply the Christian ethic by
frowning respectably from
time to time and by serving

always needed.

He dates Queens freshmen,
former Girl Scouts, the Chris-
tian Association president at
Peace, or a Nice Hometown girl.

He is ready, at the drop of a
graduate-school catalogue, to

give his views on South Africa,
collegiate morals or the purpose

He considers dance week-
ends juvenile, extravagant,
shallow and artificial, but he
does not miss any activity.

“... seeking a Purpose. ..end

He dates University girls,
Duke girls, Carolina girls, W.
C. girls, or maybe Wake Forest
girls.

THE PHYSICAL MAN

Clad in bermudag, athletic
socks and an_ All-American
smile, he wants to play.

He is bright, enthusiastic, ro-
bust. He has a hearty laugh.

Chilly evenings, he wears a
high-school letter sweater with
the monogram discreetly re-
moved.

He is shot with self-confi-
dence and chock full o° protein.

He is a walking testimonial

He can stun a bird in flight

He Is usually early-toded,

him a welcome opportunity to
prove his stamina. Saturday

organizing his bleary-eyed
brothers in a softball game,
