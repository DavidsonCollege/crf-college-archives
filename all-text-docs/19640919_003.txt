last in the conference, including polls of Southern Con-
ference coaches and sportswriters, and it is hard to dis-
agree. The most favorable prediction I find is in Playboy,
a rival publication which forecasts a 3-6 record for the
Wildcats. Three victories are a good bet, but expectation
of much more — be sheer optimism. (

y College, Lehigh, and La-
fayette are the best bets for Davidson vietine but it is
unlikely that the ’Cats will take all four.

A side of the football picture is the fact that
Davidson opponents aren’t so hot either. Only two of
these teams—Furman and Mississippi—had winning sea-
sons last year, and Mississippi College’s victories were
— over such powers.as Ouachita, Austin, and Troy

Encouraging for the future are the reports on the
freshman team. It is risky to ~ too much about the
frosh before they are tested, but it really looks like this
could be the best group of first-year men in recent years.

___ If this year’s men produce in the future a win-
ning varsity, they will have overcome what has become
Davidson’s least desirable tradition.

HOLDING OUROWN

Aside from football, Davidson seems to be able to
hold its own in the Southern Conference pretty well. The
aggregate standings for all eleven conference sports last
year place Davidson in a tie for fifth with the soldier
boys of The Citadel.

Since all members do not compete in all sports,
points are awarded on the basis of one for last, two for
next to last, etc.

Radio station WBT in Charlotte will broadcast David-
son basketball games this season, instead of the hard-to-
get Belmont station.

A radio and TV platform and booth over the east
bleachers is being installed for this season, and about
four games will be telecast from the gym. Television ar-
rangements are also being made for some of the away
games, and the games with NYU, St. Joseph’s, and West
Virginia are definitely going to be telecast.

Crowd-pleasing referees Lou Bello and Charlie Eck-

weren't hired for any Davidson games.

An addition of 190 seats to the east bleachers is be-

CHEERS FOR THE HILL

The hill opened up its purse strings some this sum-

campus with boating facilities.

Three canoes, a sailboat, a motorboat, and a fish-

use. Sophomore P. E. classes are now offered in sailing,
water skiing, and canoeing, meeting one and a half
hours one afternoon a week.

Dr. Scott notes that none of these classes will be
offered Tuesday, and that on these afternoons sailboat
instructions to all students will be offered. The athletic
de ent is requiring students to exhibit at least some
sahing ability before allowing them to check out the

THE DAVIDSONIAN

GRIDDERS GIRD FOR FALL OPPONENTS
"Real good spirit .. . working very hard. . .”

Mitchell, Holland Take :
Assistant Cage Posts

By TOM COOK
Davidsonian Sports Writer
Two faces, one new and the

other old, will join. the David-
son basketball coaching ranks
this year. Warren Mitchell,
mentor of the 1963-64 Virginia
cage champions from Newport
News, has’ been appointed as
sistant varsity coach and will
aid particularly in the scouting
and recruiting duties of the
staff. The familiar face to Wild-
eat fans belong to alumnus
Terry Holland who has been
hired to help with the fresh-
man team and to take an active
part in beating the bushes for
outstanding high school basket-
ball talent for next year’s frosh
team.

Coach Mitchell compiled a}
four-year record of 78-11, in
cluding an undefeated season
of 24 wins, which copped the
Group 1-A crown. A 1957 grad
uate of the University of Rich
mond, he was outstanding in|
the Southern Conference Tour- |
nament and was named to the |
second team All-Southern Con-|
ference basketball team. After |
serving a stint in the Army, |
Mitchell coached at York Coun-
ty (Va.) High School before

“I am delighted that Warren
will be with us next year,”
comments Head Coach Lefty
Driesell. “He has demonstrat-
ed outstanding coaching a-
bilities and has the personal
characteristics for doing a fine
job in Davidson’s basketball
program.”

Foreseeing outstanding re
cords for both the varsity and
frosh teams, Coach Mitchell re-

job, “I'm really happy to be
here and to get the opportunity
to work at Davidson.” Coach
Mitchell, his wife Anne, and
their son Warren, Jr., age four
months, are living at 413 N.
Main Street in Davidson.
Coach Holland, who was the
only starting semor on the na
tionally ranked Davidson team
which compiled a 22-4 record,
is looking forward to a “fine
season” and is anxious to work
with the current crop of fresh
man eagers..Captain of the var-
sity team last year, he led the
nation in field goal percentage
and won a place on the All-

Southern Conference second
team for his all-round ability
After averaging 23 points per}
game a freshman, Holland
joined the varsity as a sopho-
more and showed signs of
things to come in Lefty Drie
sell’s first winning team at
Davidson.

“Because he has played our
system, Terry will do a really
fine job for us’, comimented
Coach Driesell. I think he will
be an asset to our recruiting
because he was here as a stud
ent for four years and can tell
the prospects about going to
Davidson.”

Prospects for a winning
freshman football team are
“good” this year, according to
freshman coach Tom Stevens.
@ “The boys have been working
hard since September 6 and
showing a lot of spirit. We now
have twenty-three boys on the
team, but could use a few

more.”

Chip Scharfschwert, (5'11”,
190 Ibs.) is looking sharp at
quarterback. “He has a strong
arm, throws the ball well, and
is also a good runner,” says
Stevens.

Bill Taylor, (5'11", 180 Ibs.)
shares quarterbacking duties
with Scharfschwert, but he'll
start at halfback. He has a good
start, break-away speed, and
is hard to bring down.

Pete Glidewell, a 5°10", 180
Ib. fullback, is a good blocker
and straight-ahead runner.

Dick Lindsay, (5'11", 175 Ibs.)
is the other halfback.

“The line is equally as strong
as the backfield,” Stevens adds.
Kim Johnson, (6’, 175. Ibs.) is
an aggressive end with good
hands. Walter Greene, (6', 200
lbs.) plays center and is an
aggressive linebacker.

Tupper Morehead,  (5'11",
205 tbs.) and George Solley,
(5'11", 185 Ibs.) are the top
guards, and Ken Vogel, (5'10",
185 lbs.) and Ross Dorneman,
(5'11", 220 lbs.) are the tackles.

The freshmen have five
games this year, opening with
Lees-McCrae October 5 at Ban-

Spirit, Nasty Helmets

Mark ’64 Cat Gridders

“Our squad has real good
spirit and is working very
hard,” reports football Head

Coach Bill Dole after
watching the 1964 edition
of the Wildcats work out
for three weeks.

With ten starters gone from
last year’s team that won only
one game, an exceedingly light
and somewhat slow team, in-
juries to several key personnel,
a rather ragged scrimmage
against Carolinas Conference
celler-dweller Newberry, and
some rather nasty looking new
black helmets, little else can
be said good about the ‘red
and black machine’’ of David-
son's fight song.

Dole notes that the NCAA's
liberal substitution rule ‘‘should
be a help to us,"’ and he plans
to use an offensive unit and a
defensive unit in taking advant
age of the rules change

The key to the ‘Cat offense
is 185 Ib, quarterback Steve
Heckard—a starter at end last
year and Davidson's only hon
orable mention on the All Con
ference team. Heckard is prob

ably the best athlete on the
squad, but his somewhat less
than pinpoint passing accuracy
leaves much to be desired, as
was indicated in last Saturday's
scrimmage.

Steve Smith, a 170 lb. junior,
and Lyle Blalock, a 179 Ib.
senior, are the halfbacks on
Dole’s “go” team.

Seniors Pat Fischer (171) and
Dave Hendricks (210) will
handle the fullback duties and
will also alternate on defense.
Fischer is currently out with
a broken hand, but should be
ready for the opener against
Mississippi College.

At end posts are 195 lb. senior
Steve Davidson and 175 bb.
sophomore Bill Rikard.

Starter Dan Barefoot is out
indefinitely with a shoulder in-
jury, leaving junior Tom Sim
mons (220) and Ed Childs (208),
a sophomore, to battle for his
“ackle position, 213 Ib. Stu
Perry, a junior, fills the other
tackle slot,

Offensive guards are 222 Ib.
senior Jay Rogers and either
Julian Fite (175) or Joe Gaddy
(185), both sophomores.

Starting at center is 185 Ib.
senior Will Jackson, and back-
ing him at the pivot post is
163 Ib. senior Dave Walker, who
has been unable to practice yet
because of an injured back.

The defensive end posts are
manned by juniors Pack Hind-
sley (200) and Jim Rollins (215),
both capable performers. Mike
Cummings (210), a junior, and
senior Bruce Dalton (195) are
the defensive tackles.

Juniors Jerry Blackstock (190)
and Woody Hill (195) form a
strong defensive guard corps,
and sophomore Gary Waldron
(205) mans the middle of the
defensive line.

In the secondary are junior
Dave Sprinkle (155), sopho-
mores Jim Phipps (170) and
Tommy Dews (168), and either
Hendricks or Fischer.

In reference to Davidson's
schedule, Dole reports that ‘‘all
of the opponents will be tough.
Richmond could be the confer-
champ, and we will be
outmanned in all our Southern
Conference games (Richmond,
Furman, Citadel, VMI) because
of our small number of scholar-
ships.”
