Counsellor Or Disciplinarian?

AN ANALYSIS

By. RICH WILSON
Managing Editor
While many students and

faculty members seem : to
accept the idea of a Coun-
cil on Student Conduct and
the revised court structure
proposed by the Trustee
Governance Committee, a
major controversy seems to
be developing over the func-
tion of the Dean of Students.

Under the suggested sy

stem, the Dean of Students.

would bé the focal point for
all violations that occur on
campus, both administra-
tive as well as violations of
the Code. of Responsibility.

The ‘violation of admini-
Strative regulations, which
include parking violations or

defacement of school ‘proper:

ty, will be handled by levy-
ing fines. However, in the
case of violations of the code,
all judicial procedings will
begin with notification of the
Dean of ‘Students.

“At that point the Dean

of Students would list the
possible sanctions,” says Wal-
ter L. Lingle, chairman of
the governance committee.
“The student would then have
the option of allowing the
Dean of Students to handle
the case or take the casé
to the hearing committee
(an all. student court).”
When Dean of Students
Will H. Terry assumed of-
‘fice in January, he said he

would ‘“‘play down” his fune-
tion of a disciplinarian and

‘emphasize his role as a coun-

sellor. However, the recent
suggestions of the Trustee
Governance Committee call
for the Dean of Students to
be the focal point of ‘all dis-
ciplinary action.

Can the Dean of Students
play the role of a_ discipli-
narian and a counsellor at
the same time? This seems
to be the center of the con-
troversy. °

In the opening meeting on
campus. governance _yester-
day, Vice, President for Aca-
demic Affairs John M. Bev-
an maintained that the Dean

‘of Students could fulfill both

roles.
“What
do,” he

we
said,

are trying to
“is give dis-

Da

cretionary powers to One in:
dividual. The ~Dean of Stu-
dents must exercise his
judgment on each case that
comes before him.

“There is a conflict of roles
in every jeb,”’ he said. ‘‘The
Dean of the Faculty at times
must strengthen the faculty,
and at other times he has the
responsibility to fire a mem-
ber of the faculty.

“If the student is afraid of
the Dean of Students he can

always take his case-to the

hearing committee. However,
I think we should give some
students the opportunity to
deal with one man rather
than a group.”

Bevan seemed to be
only one at the meeting who
held this position.

the.

Terry, sitting beside Bevan,
said he realized what the
governance committee was
trying to accomplish; how-
ever he said he was. afraid
the students would not trust
a man as a counsellor when
they know he is also is the
disciplinarian.

SGA President Danny Clod-
felter added that he would
like. to see the encourage-
ment of the counselling func-
tion of the Dean of Students
and the discouragement - of
the role of the disciplinarian.

‘But I wonder,"’ he said,
“whether a man in the posi-
tion of the dean can make

this separation. Further-
more, we may tailor this
system to ‘Will but what

about his successor? Will he

‘he able to make the separa

tion?"

Steven Salyer, class of '72,
questioned why both the role
of the disciplinarian and the
role of a counselor must be
combined in one individual. -
“Why not divide the roles
with somebody else or with
another committe?” he sald.
“IT thought we were trying to
progress beyond the stage
where the dean acted as the
disciplinarian.”’

Student suspicion of the du-
al function of the Dean was
reflected as the meeting
breke up and one student
said, ‘Boy, this is just What
I need, I go into the Dean of
Students office to be coun-
selled and he kicks me out
of school!"" .

Stacks Foresees
Laundry Option

By GRAY WILSON
Managing Editor

A coin-operated lauftdry

may beeome a reality at Da-.

vidson in the next few years,
possibly by 1973, according
to “Manager of the College
Laundry Clyde W. Stacks.

“I have recommended a
coin-operated laundry, ~ but
there are several options for
future years,’’ said Stacks.

In response to an omnibus
bill on the college laundry
and janitorial service pro-
posed by sophomore Doug
Sittler, the student Senate
will meet Monday night with
Stacks to discuss the status
of the. laundry.

“I'll be there to answer all
the question they want,”
said. Stacks. "‘I think the stu-
dents sand not the adminis-
tration should decide, and
_any. action ‘will be left up to
the senate.”’

_Stacks estimated that a
coin-operated laundry for
1,000 students would cost
about 15,000 dollars for\ma-
chinery alone, and that an-
“other building would have to
be found to hold it.

Sittler stated at a senate
meeting last week that the
laundry lost 12,000 dollars
last year.

Stacks said that he does not
know how much money was

| Jost because the college busi-

ness office is in. charge of
the finances. He has been or
dered, however, to trim 14,-
000 dollars from the laundry
budget for next year.
“Since laundry fees will
not be raised, the cuts will
have to come in the area of
personnel and consequently
services, but exactly how has
not yet been decided,’’ com-

*mented Stacks.

Stacks. said that with a
coinoperated laundry, © his
service will continue to han-
dle shirts because students
would have difficulty washing
and pressing them satisfac
torily.

With the present laundry
system the 110 dollar fee is
prorated, and Stacks said
that this setup varies the
amount which each student
costs per year for his laun-
dry load.

“Students may vary from
100 dollars to 200 dollars
worth in the number of
clothes they bring down here,
but some of them may: get
off a lot cheaper with a coin-
operated laundry,” he said.

Commenting on the effi-
ciency of his staff, Stacks
Said, ‘‘In 22 years the laun-
dry fee has gone up 35 dol-
lars, “but employee wages
have doubled in that period
of time. Also this year we
have had fewer mistakes
than ever before.’’

_will speak on

The governor, active in
many regional..and national
educational organizations,
“The Import-
ance of Being Unique,” re-
ferring to the individuality of
colleges and universities.

The Spring Convocation,
which will honor the sopho
more class, will begin with
an academic procession, after
which Scott will.be°awarded
an honorary doctor of laws
degree, and several major
student awards will be pre-
sented.

Classes normally schedul-
ed between 10 a.m. and 3:00
p.m. on Monday have been
postponed.

Besides sophomores and
their parents, those invited
to the convocation include lo-
cal government officials, the
North Carolina Congressional
delegation, members of the
Board of Visitors and the
Board of. Trustees, and sev
eral other alumni and friends
of the college.

According to College Pres-
ident Samuel R. Spencer Jr.,
the convocation was planned
for several reasons.

First, Spencer said, the
convocation will bring the
college community together
during the spring, just as the
Fall Convocation does at the
beginning. of each academic
year. -

Also, Spencer pointed out

that the Spring Awards Con- .

vocation will give the parents
of students a chance to come
to visit the campus again,
since the conyocation rests
midway between Freshman
Parents’ Weekend and Fall
Convocation, honoring seni-
ors. :
Spencer also emphasized
that the convocation itself
can be stimulating to campus
life. He is particularly pleas-

ger education” so

ed with Scott's visit to cam-
pus to speak at the convoca
tion,

“Governor Scott's concern
for maintaining the strength
of both the public and pri-
vate sectors of higher educa-
tion has been most encourag
ing to those of us in the col
leges and universities,’’ Spen-
cer said.

In a speech last fall to the
North Carolina Association of
Independent Colleges and
Universities, Scott called on
institutions in the state to
“remove the barriers to high-
that more
students from North Carolina
would go to college.

“One of the goals of my
administration,” he said,
