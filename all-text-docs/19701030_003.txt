Visiting Oceanographer
Cites ‘Continuum Life’

By DICK ANDERSON
Associate Editor

The present tHreat from
pollution is the result of
man’s failure to realize that
he lives in a continuum, ac-
cording to Dr. John J. A.
‘McLaughlin, an oceanogvap-
her from Fordham Univer-
sity in New York.

““Man was lulled into a
false .sense .of security by
nature's ability to recover
from limited abuse,’ Mc-
Laughlin said during his
Danforth Lectures in the col-
lege union (Monday and
Tuesday.

“But there is a_ principle
~of ecology that not many
. people “inderstand: I can
kill indirectly by..killing* a
factor of the, food chain. I
d@ndt have to kill the fish
to kill fish,’’ McLaughlin
said,

(‘McLaughlin explained that
Although fish are not affect-
ed by some forms of water
pollution, their food sources
may be killed off by damage
to factors affecting organ-

isms which feed the food of,

the fish.

He cited the example of

baggies covering the _ bot-
toms” of streams and_ pre-
‘venting the essential inter:
change be ween organi m3

those” fioating in or on the
water.

Another result of the fact:

of living in a continuum
was that nothing was ever
lost, according to McLaugh-
lin, except in the sense of
chemical changes.

“A spit in the Missis-
sippi,’’ he said, ‘‘may some-
day wash the shores of the
(Maldive Islands."’

McLaughlin’s second lec-
ture was on the possibility
of reversing the effects of
pollution.

“There is

in two Piedmont Visiting
Scholars, Program lectures
‘Monday. Ps

‘Both lectures will be held
in Dana 114. ,

His first lecture at 10 a.
m. will be entitled ‘‘Newton
‘Revisited.’’ It will examine
ithe origins of calculus, the
branch of mathematics in-
vented by Sir Isaac Newton
in the sixteenth century.

At “3:30 p.m., .a reception
will be held for Buck in the
lobby of Dana Science Build-
ing, followed at 4 p.m. by
the second lecture, ‘‘Mathe-
matics and the Social Scien-
ces.”’

Buck is the author of more
than fifty technical articles
and books dealing with an-
alytical mathematics..From
1964 to 1966, he was -chair-
man of the mathematics de-
partment at Wisconsin where
he has taught since 1950.

He was a junior fellow at
Howard from 1942 to 1943
and 1945 to 1947. Hé was al-

given a reasonable effort in
that direction," he said.
“This is something — that
scientists believe with heart
and soul."' .
However, McLaughlin

warned that the decision tp

clean up pollution must be
made immediately. In his
opinion environmental decay
was not an inevitable by-
product of an industrial so-
ciety, but this decay needed
to be arrested within the
next 20 years or the damage
would ‘be irrevocable.

A lecturer in psychology,
religion, and philosophy in
Des Moines, and across the
country, (Palmgren is a

The freshmen will now be
represented by Class Presi-
dent Bidl Ralston and Vice
President Chip Davidson.

Bevan said that the com-
mittee had been split into
two subcommittees. One,
with College Treasurer Rob-
ert A. Currie as chairman,
will deal with the ‘‘finan-
cial aspects of the pro-
blem.” The other, headed
by Dean of Students Richard
C. Burts Jr., will handle the
‘procedural aspects for
phasing.” ;

When asked about the
status. of fraternities, Bevan
responded that under the
trustees’ proposal — frater-
nities had four alternatives:
1) to remain national .and
in their present house, 2)
to disaffiliate from nationals
but remain a local fratern-
ity, 3) to remain nationally
affiliated and move out, and

Bevan stated that his hope
is “that basically that fra-
ternities will appeal to their
nationals to continue their

and dis-

_ affiliation within the defin-

ition of affiliation) defined
by the college.” ;
He added that a letter is-
sued from Dean Burts’ of-
fice stating this ideal has
been sent to the officials of
the national fraternities re-
presented at Davidson.
However, another commit-
tee member stated that Bev-
an said during Monday’s
meeting that freshmen should

know that if they presently
accepted bids from these
fraternities, there would be
no assurance that they would
be eating there next year,
-Bevan said that the com.
mittee will be meeting every
Thursday in the E.:L. Bax-
ter’ Davidson Room in
Chambers and that’ the
meetings would be open.

However, Bevan stressed
that they are open ‘‘a8 audi-
ience, not: as platform” con-
sidering that the purpose of
the committee is ‘to ex-
pedite matters within the
limits of -the. trustees’ ac-
tion.”
