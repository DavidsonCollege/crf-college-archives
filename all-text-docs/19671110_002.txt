Good Start

It is doubtful that the newly-re-
leased Blue Sky report will make any
seniors flunk this year just to come
back to see what a good education
should be. The recommendations
should, however, make Davidson much
more attractive for incoming fresh-
men.

After waiting impatiently for so
long, it is gratifying to see that the
wait was worthwhile. The report con-
tains few radical new breakthroughs
in the field of education, but it does
recommend somethings that are sig:
nificantly beneficial both to students
and to the college.

Increased reliance upon the stu-
dent’s: own initiative will result in
more students who are really students
and not just free-riders for four years
of laziness and boredom. Hopefully,
the new curriculum will be able to
educate instead of just polish the Da-
vidson gentleman. Concern for the
student as an individual has always
been the liberal arts college’s point of
defense against the larger. resources
of the university. The recommenda-
tions of the Blue Sky Committee could
make this claim more of a reality than
an unfulfilled promise.

There are innovations that could be
made in the report. Among the faults
of the report is its ambiguity about
grades. Area examinations are on a
pass-fail basis. but individual courses

will apparently retain the present
grading system.

The Yale University faculty recent-
ly voted to replace numerical grading
with a system under which students
will be given one of four designations
for their work—fail, pass, high pass
or honors. Derek Shearer, head of the
Student Advisory Board that helped
bring about the change, said the new
system ‘‘moves away from the pseudo-
scientific claims of the numbers sys-
tem. .. . It should make for an improv-
ed class atmosphere, for there will be
no more quibbling about numbers.
There would, I hope, be more concern
for the quality of a student’s work in
terms of his own ability.”

One of the most forward-looking
proposals made by the Blue Sky Com-
mittee is the Career/Service program.
it is an excellent way for the student
to get his feet wet-in the occupation
about which he is thinking before it is
too late. The committee is quite cor-
rect in saying the educational nature
of the program necessitates that its
administration not just be dumped in
the lap of the present placement pro-
gram. Because of the difficulty inher-
ent in making the program worthwhile
for each individual. it is also necessary
that it not be given to a professor as
a part-time job. It needs a full-time ad-
ministrator to find the career and ser-
vice opportunities that will be most
beneficial to the student.

The Peace Corps has a working
agreement with the New York State
University College at Brockport where-
by the student receives summer train-
ing by the Peace Corps, serves some
time abroad and receives credit from
the college. This is an addition to the
Career/Service Program that should
be considered.

But the most important thing to
consider is that the implementation
of the Blue Sky recommendations if
and when it comes, must not be the
final word. The reeommendations go
far, but they do not reach the end of
Davidson’s potential. Just one exam-
ple is the committee’s own sub-com-
mittee report on student life. the fate-
of which has not yet been announced.
This by itself should be enough to keep
the committee blue-skying for a while
longer.

A Limited View

Regardless of whether former Tar
Heel governor Terry Sanford is really
planning to make a bid for the seat
now held by Sen. Sam J. Ervin. Jr.,
rumors about the possibility have
caused Ervin to demonstrate one of
the old, sad truisms about Southern
politicians.

Responding to a two-week-old story
in a Fayetteville newspaper which said
that Sanford was thinking about enter.
ing the senatorial race. Ervin told a
member of The Charlotte Observer
Washington: Bureau Wednesday that
he is confident that he could hold his
seat. °

Apparently one reason for Ervin’s
confidence is his belief that he can
easily refute Sanford’s complaints
about the present Senate make-up.
The Fayetteville newspaper story
quoted Sanford as saying, “There is
no spokesman in the Senate from any

state who is working to make state
government more effective.”

Ervin’s rebuttal to this charge was,
“l believe I can say: without fear of
any successful contradiction that no
member of the Senate has fought hard-
er to preserve the powers of the state
within the contemplation of the Con-
stitution than I have since I’ve been
here.”

The importance of this exchange at
the moment is not in the possibility of
a senatorial bid by Sanford. Neither is
it meant to be found in the compla-
cency of long-term Senators. The im-
portance of Ervin’s remark’‘is that in
one neat sentence he managed to
verify the charge that all that many
Southern politicians can think about
in a discussion of effective state gov-
ernment is the limited issue of states
rights. This lack of imagination one
reason why the South traditionally has
lacked effective state government.

Evading Issues

The Senate Permanent Subcommit-
tee on Investigations has finally open-
ed hearings on the causes of last sum-
mer’s riots in American cities. This
inquiry deserves the most careful, in-
depth search. Thoughtful citizens want
to know the cause, and cure, of the
riots and destruction which suddenly
flamed in Detroit, Newark and else-
where.

Were the riots spontaneous? Or
were they precipitated by agitators
and militant activists? Or did they be-
gin spontaneously and then were fan-
ned into wider burning and shooting
by agitators? Sen. John Sherman
Cooper of Kenutcky sought vainly to
amend the authorizing Senate resolu-
tion to include specific search into the
“economic and social’ problems in-
volved. But Chairman John McClellan
of Arkansas says all aspects will be
examined, “immediate and long-stand-
ing.”

fi is the “long-standing” causes that
need spreading on the records as a
Senate investigation can so graphical-
lv do. Howmany blacks in the ghettos
despair of improving their lot but
want effective integration, economic
opportunity and American-style suc-
cess? How many, or how very few,
are virulent with hatred for the white
power structure? How many Com-
munists are involved or would seek
involvement? .

Who actually rioted in Detroit,
where race relations and Negro op-

portunities were relatively good? Dan-
iel P. Moynihan, director of the Urban
Studies Center at MIT and Harvard,
says the rioting, was carried forward
largely by an “urban underclass.” In
many American cities this youthful
class is composed of Negroes. In
Europe, the underclass may be white;
in India, coffee-colored.

It takes neglect to form such a class:
unemployment, wages well below the
norm, miserable housing, a welfare
system that wrecks family living, sub-
standard schooling. Will the Senate
investigations subcommittee discover
that this is what America has allowed
to happen in many major cities? Or
will it center its probe on Stokely Car-
michael, Rap Brown and other acti-
vists whose inflammatory statements
are deplored by many Negroes?

A statistical portrait of the Negro,
ordered by President Johnson after
the riots, suggests that blacks are
moving into the middle-income brack-
ets faster than previously supposed.
But life certainly: is not found to be
improving in the ghettos.

Americans today have a sprawl] of
uncoordinated information about
“nonviolence,” “black power,” “Chris:
tian leadership,” — about which
.agency is doing what in the ghettos —
about what the “new” Negro attitude
is. The Senate subcommittee can do a
tremendously enlightening job here
— if it will.

‘Time For Renewal’ Pike Claims

By BOB DUNHAM .
and FRANK ANDERSON

“Now is the time to renew
the church — while there is
still. something to renew.”
Episcopal Bishop James A.
Pike told a capacity audi-
ence at Queens College Sat-
urday night..

Pike charged the churches
with “not saying it Like it is."
with being “less moral than
the United States Senate.”
and with “answering unask-
ed questions.”

Citing figures which show-
ed an inverse corretation be-
tween ethics and the amount
of participation in churches,
Pike criticized a concern with
the Image of the church as
respectable and conservative
rather than as Christian.

Pike's attacks on the church
and on its doctrines have
prompted accusations of here-
sy and resulted eventually in
his censure by the Episcopal

House of Bishops in October
of last year.

‘A lawyer who gave up his
practice to become a priest.

without notes. with words

speaking—he revised his view

Dormitory Council Concept
Blocks Unification: Powell

Dear Editor:

For seemingly emdles:
months. the Constitution Re-
vision Committee has been
working hard to propose for
the student body a new con-
stitution, one aim of which
is to unify student govern-
ment efforts on campus.

We have tried exceptional-
ly hard to keep our proposed
new government uncomplicat-
ed. Now, however, it seems
that the Dormitory Council
proposal is In the process of
being resurrected, and all
our hopes for simplicity and
Streamlining appear to be
doomed.

According to its propon-
erits. the Dormitory Council
has three objectives: to re-
duce damage in dorms: to
provide for such programs as
open dorms: and to under-
take dorm improvement
studies. ;

I agree with the desirabil
ity of these. objectives: how
ever. I contend that. existing
organizations are capable of
providing them.

Advocates. of the Dorm
Council] want to designate
students on each hall who are

responsible for. reporting vio-
lators of dormitory regula.
tions. The violators would
be tried by either special
Dormitory Council courts or
the Regulations Court.

The Regulations Court and
the Investigations Committee
are now. charged with the
responsibility for preventing
major damage to the dorms.
They can fulfill the same
functions. if they so desire,
that are proposed for the
Dormitory Council.

The answer to stopping
dorm damage lies not in cre-
ating hall policemen and
eight-or-so new courts, but in
the Investigations Committee
and the Regulations Court
fulfilling their purposes.

As a sidelight. it seems to
me that the administration is
going to have to admit that a
certain amount of dorm dam-
age inevitably is going to oc-
eur each year, Major destruc-
tion such as that in Richard
son last year should be stop.
ped. I'll agree: however, we

djreadv have the machinery -

to do it.. Why create more?
Con.erning the .remaining
' ob ectives of the Dorm

Council. open dorms and sim.
flar projects and dorm im.
provement projects, I would
ask why our present Student
Council could not: set up a
committee within existing
structures to act in these
areas.

The Student Council repre-
sents everyone in the dorms;
it can and should act for
them. No new body Is need-
ed.

I suppose an infinite num-
ber of structured relation-
ships could be created among
Davidson's 1,000 students:
but our recent aims have
been unification and stream-
lining.

Why complicate the matter
to the point of,.in effect, hav-
ing two separate student
governments on.campus? The
Dormitory Council is unnec-
essary and I'm afraid will
prove to be extremely trou-
blesome.

Red Clay Reader Captures
Spirit Of South’s Creativity

Red Clay Reader 4.
Carleen Whisnant, editor,
Southern Review,
$3.00.

When William Faulkner
was at the University of Vir-
ginia in the spring of 1957,
somebody asked him if he
might have an explanation
for the blossoming of South-
ern writing. that is. if there
were any circumstances in
the environment that might
explain the blossoming of a
good number of fine writers.

Faulkner answered typical-
ly: “I don't know. That's a
literary question and I would
not undertake to answer it.”

I might say that when that
so-called blossoming of South-
ern writers came along, it
was at a time when nobody
in the South had much mon-
ey, they couldn't travel. and
they had to invent a world a
little different from the one
they lived in, and so they
took to writing, which is
cheaper than—that is. a ream
of paper and a pencil is
cheaper than a railroad tick.

less numbers of flourishing
and failing Jittle magazines.

Big WAYS. that in this time
Red Clay Reader could be in
its fourth year of publication
is fantastic.

Conceived in that deter-
mined spirit of the Southern-
er without enough money to
buy a railroed ticket. Red
Clay Reader now draws from
all over the country, indeed.
from the world (as it reaches

into Russia for poems by Ar-
seny A. Tarkovsky).

The fiction and poetry are
uneven, but there is more of

it than ever. Established
writers like Max Steel (now
writer-in-residence at €hap-
el Hill) and Heather Ross
Miller are found, along with
others making their first ap-
pearances. The graphics and
photography are experiment
al and daring.

More than half of the non-
fiction is devoted to W. J.
Cash, and if you are still
among those who think that
Cash went to Mexico and was
subsequently 1) murdered by
Nazi agents, or 2) decided to
end his life because he was
suffering from an incurable
-brain tumor, or 3) was the
victim of somebody's foul
play because when he was
found hung by his necktie his
feet were touching the floor,
then read his wife’s account
of what happened in March
1941. .

If you are among those who
think that everybody in Flat

Rock thought Carl Sandburg
was a real bastard. then read
Harry Golden's “Carl San.
burg’s Family.”

If you think that Charlotte
really is the end of nowhere,
then read Red Clay Reader
and see what some remark
able folks at 2221 Westmin-
ster Place have done.

It is a real achievement,
and a testament to what that
indomitable Southern spirit
can do out on the back porch

and anyone interested in new
writing. particularly from
the South, ought to shell out
the dirt cheap three dollars.

Charlotte yet. Pike added.
“it will at some time get

“The scientific method has
succeeded in our time, and

Bands Vs. Beavers

THE DAVIDSONIAN recently ran a feature story
about the Gross National Product Rug Band. As a .
charter member of that group, 1 feel that the atten-
tion given it was entirely out of proportion to the tal--

ent contained in the group.

It must be granted that the members of the group
have a natural talent for grossness, but beyond this
dubious distinction, little.can be said for their abilities.
In fact, the group is not only gross, it also slumps on
occasion into a slightly sacrilegious posture. The Prot-
estant tradition is mocked by the parody. “Rug of
Ages,” and the glorious heritage of the Truckers’ Inn
is made light of by the slightly satirical “My Rug”.

What | am trying to say is that there are many
worth-while campus organizations, both potential and
active, that deserve the attention which is currently
being paid to, of all things, a rug band. The Beaver
Club and the Faculty Executive Committee are two
such organiations which immediately come to mind.

Both organizations play roles on the campus about
as vital as that played by the Rug Band. The only dil-
ference is that the Faculty Executive Committee and
the Beaver Club don’t do their fiddling around with
musical instruments. Nonetheless, enforcing the drink-
ing rule and entertaining visiting athletic teams (what-
ever that implies) are about as vital to the life ‘of the
campus as playing for a rug dedication at the Union or

at a frattie club.

But even the Faculty Executive Committee and
the Beaver Club receive a certain amount of notice
from the student body. There are other deserving or-
ganizations which get none at all.

_For instance, Phil Jones is quite interested in or-
ganizing a Davidson chapter of the Future Farmers of
America. He even has a good project lined up: his idea
is to buy a piglet (i.e., baby pig), raise him to maturity
in the Wildcat cage beside the Union (not to be con
fused with the Wildcat Den beside the Hub), and then,
at a gala banquet towards the end of the school year,
give him to the athletic department for use as a mas-
cot, under the condition that the nickname of David-
son athletic teams be changed from the ‘‘Wildcats” to
the “Crimson Swine”. So far, response from the stu-
dent body has been pitiful, to say the least. Surely.
someone out there in the wasteland of student apathy
wants to spend his spare time slopping a hog.

An equally deserving organization is “Response.”
set up for those not involved in the YMCA “Stimulus”
program. The founders of this group, notably Cary
White and Mike Powell, oppose all efforts to act on
ones own initiative. Instead they favor passive re-
sponse to the environment, preferably in a posture of

slumber.

Several program ideas have issued forth from
the minds of the founders, including such possibili-
ties as a lesson on the making of doughnut holes to
be given by the grim baker, or a program on the ele-
ments of hamburger frying to be illustrated by Betty

up at the What-a-Burger.

_This by no means exhausts the list of campus or-
ganizations worthy of more attention from the press
and the student body. Tom Bellamy, for example, is
attempting to get up a group of students willing to

burn their Davidson Colle

ge id. cards in a public cere-

mony. I understand also that Billy Thebaut is working
on forming an organization along the lines of a ‘“Cam-
pused Anonymous”. Such a society would provide a
means by which a campused student could, when faced
with that stir crazy feeling, talk ot another student in
a similar plight, in an attempt to retain sanity while
under the effects of this most crue] but not unusual

punishment.
