New Residences

Have Old Format

The seriousness of the pres-
ent dormitory situation is ex-
emplified by the fact that the
newest dormitory on the cam-
pus is basically the same as
the original ones.

When the college was found-
ed in 1837 there were about 30
students living in Oak and Elm
Halls on what is now the west
end of the campus. Their
rooms opened to the outside
and their washing facilities
were on the front of the build-
ing and their out houses were
behind.

The rooms were Spartan.
with beds and desks, poor
lighting and no heat.

In 1961, Richardson Hall was
built and that school year ac-
commodated 130 students.
Their rooms opened on to an
outside hallway with toilet
facilities just down the hall
well within walking distance
of every room.

The trouble was that very
little progress had been made
in 124 years. Elm and Oak
Halls are still with us: only
they are longer, roofed and
stacked on top of each other.
The architectural format is

still the same.

According to Mrs. Peter Ni-
cholls, supervisor of dormitor-
jes, there is a slim chance of
new dormitories being built.
She sees the problem as a
question of living with what is
already here. “It's like ‘which
came first the chicken or the
egg’.”’ she said. ‘Are the
dorms in their present shape
because of neglect on the part
of the students or are the stu-
dents negligent because living
quarters are so dismal?” she
continued.

“It's hard to say."’ she add-
ed, ‘‘but the fact remains that
destruction and neglect on the
part of the students is certain-
ly the root of our present prob.
lem.

‘It is human to be influenc-
ed by one’s surroundings (take
Hattié’s for example) and our
dormitories are without a
doubt detrimental to any sort
of intellectually congenial. at-
mosphere."’ Mrs. Nicholls said.

Rooms are bleak, lighting :is
noise is ubiquitous.
showers seald and long halls
facilitate hall soccer and box-
ing matches with disquieting

consistency.

Mrs. Nicholls went on to say.
“There seems to be no one
breaking his neck in the rush
to build new derms, and cer-
tainly’ when that day comes
there will be more than enough
salable solutions. For the pres-
ent problem is to make the
present buildings more liva-
ble.

“This summer rooms will be
painted different colors.
lounges will be carpeted, and
water fountains will be install-
ed on certain dorms. Action is
also being taken that will hope-
fully effect new lounges in
Watts. East and Cannon,”
she continued.

“And of course Open House
will make everyone more care-
ful about conditions in gen-
eral. The rest is up to the
students themselves. It is they
who decide whether or not to
shoot fire extinguishers or
break down doors: and it is
they who can persuade the ad
ministration that indeed they
do deserve major expenditures
for dormitory improvements,”
Mrs. Nicholls added.

$200,000 Set Aside
For Dorm Renovation

By ED EMBREE
Managing Editor

Included in the original 10-
year projection of collegv

needs prepared for the Ford ~

Foundation grant was $200,000
for dormitory improvement
according to Robert Currie.
college business manager.

“We need the money for
very essential dormitory Te-

quirements,"" stated Currie.
According to Grover C.
Meetze, director of physical
plant. some of this money has
been spent for the installation
of lavatories in each room in
Watts, improved wiring in two
of the freshman dorms, and
the installation of light

switches in East and Cannon.
Currie explained that the
$200,000 figure was not ‘‘an

allocation of available funds’
but.a fund raising goal. ‘‘When
we get the money, we will
then give it to the project with
the highest priority."

“In including dormitory up-
grading in its 10-year pro.
jection, of needs, the college
has recognized the need for
dormitory modernization,”

stated Currie.

RICHARDSON DAMAGE
Clock And Sign Destroyed By Students

By FRANKLIN ANDERSON
Assistant Managing Editor

A Residence Hall Association
that would be able to estab:
lish periodic three hour open
dorm. periods is being planned
by a committee working under
Mrs. Peter Nicholls. supervi-

sor of dormitories, and Jim -

Terry. assistant dean of stu-
dents.

The idea grew out of a pro
posal by Mrs. Nicholls to have
times when the dormitories
would be open. When planning
for this was given approval by
the dean of students. a com
mittee was formed to work out
the procedures.

“The students are the ones

that are going to have to take -

the ball here.” said Mrs.
Nicholls. The conditions in the
dormitories would ‘have to be
improved, and students would
have to prepare for times
when the buildings would be
open.

The present draft of the con
stitution, which should be sub
mitted to resident students
later this month, provides for
a nine.or 10 member Resi-
dence Hall Council for overall
supervision of the dormitories.

Each dormitory would elect
one representative to the Coun-
cil, with Belk electing two. for
a total of eight. The president
would be elected by the asso
ciation, and perhaps the vice
president.

Each dormitory would have
a house committee composed
of one representative from
each floor and the council! rep-
resentative. who would be
chairman. Each house com
mittee could register with the
dean's office to have the dor
mitory open during a three-
hour period.

The times possible for open
dormitories would probably be
limited, “say from noon lo
10 p.m..”" said Mrs. Nicholls,
but she stressed that plans are
far from certain.

“We are aiming. if possi-
ble." she said, ‘‘to have some

dorms hold Open House before
the, end of the vear."

The. house committees are
designed “lo organize and
sponsor recreational itd social
activities, too."" she said. She
did not rule out. the possibility
of a house committee sponsor
ing its own Open End or party.

The Residence Halt Council
would also ‘‘be ‘responsible for
some effective control of stu-
dent conduct in the dorms.”
said Mrs. Nicholls. mentioning
that there was not a_ hall
clock working or even there in
Richardson. and that on Mon
day she already had several
forms requesting repair of
doors in Watts that had been
damaged since the vacation.

Advisory power would be
granted to the Residence Hall
Council in the area of dormi-
tory regulations, since the
council would be in charge of
enforcing them.

Mrs. Nicholls said that she
did not see the real necessity
of continuing the Student Body
Regulations Board. since this
group was created mainly for
control of dormitory behavior.

The committee has also dis-
cussed the possibility of a
study room on each hall and a
reception room in each dormi-
tory. At present, there are no
study rooms. and only Little.
Belk and Richardson have re-
ception rooms.

Student
committee are Sam Darby,
David Hubbard, B. A. Aiken
and Julian Fite.

Dormitory problems are also
being investigated by the Blue
Sky Committee. Their Student
Life Subcommittee has work-
ing under it a Dormitory Life

Committee which has submit-

ted recommendations to the
Student Life Subcommittee.

Student Life Subcommittee
members are students Bill An-
drews. John Gresham and
Bobby Lane and _ professors
James Martin, Charles Ratliff,
Anthony Abbott. Alan Brink-
ley, William McGavock and
Hansford Epes.
