on his mattress in front of West dormitory lest Sunday night es
pursied on-lookers stare in astonishment. Moffitt’s rather uncon-
ventional behaviour resulted from a disagreement with roommates.

acting as secretary-treasurer of the
organization.

One of the Beaver Club’s chief
boosters is the assistant director
of athletics, A. Heath Whittle.
Coach Whistle, who has been a
prominent figure on the athletic
scene here for a good many years,
is highly complimentary of the or-
that they
“have really done an excellent
job.”

To confirm his statement, he
points with pride to numerous let-
ters of appreciation from visiting
teams, who cite Davidson's hos-
pitality as the best they have en-
countered anywhere. Thus the
Beaver Club strives to extend to
our visiting athletes the friendly
spirit which is so distinctly David-
son's.

Membership is limited to the
sophomore and junior classes,
When a member reaches the status
of a senior, he is automatically re-
tired. In April, twelve members of
the rising sophomore class will be
elected to membership.

This year’s Beaver Club is com-
prised of the following men:

Juniors—Ish Bennett, Henry
Brown, Corky Clark, Charlie Cou-
sar, Dickie Davis, Floyd Feeney,
Lacy Keesler, Frank Mitchener,
Scotty Reems, Edson Weeks and
Jim Thacker.

Sophomores—Hobby Cobb, Dick
Adams, Bo Abernathy, Harold
Davis, Perrin Anderson, Billy
Morris, Jim Shelton, Jim Daugh-
drill, Jim Patterson and Phil

of his countrymen for pointing the
way to the faults of a system that
could not, and did not, long sur-
vive.

Perhaps we cannot stand in easy
awe of such a man who took a
point of view that seemed so op-
posed to the Southerners. It was
through his foresight and brilliance
that he saw a situation clearly for
what it was and did not lack the
courage to point it out to his fel-
low men even though doing so
meant taking an unpopular stand.

He does, however, hold a certain
right to our respect and admira-
tion for what he did. Especially
should we remember him as some
