Country club atmosphere in

By DAVID HULL
Staff Writer

It appears that Davidson
College will be moving toward
a country club atmosphere if
Athletic Director Thomas
Cartmill is able to realize his
plans for future athletic faci-
lities,

‘““A country club set-up
would fit in well here at David-
son,’’ Cartmill commented.

Cartmill is outlining ten-
tative plans for a building that
would house both indoor ten-
nis courts and a swimming
pool, a nine-hole golf course,
additional squash and racket-
ball courts, and new intramur-
al basketball courts.

Scheduling no problem if
Cats withdraw from SC

By LYMAN COLLINS

The Davidson College Ath-
letic Department is currently
reviewing Davidson’s position
in the Southern’ Conference.

It was announced last June
that Davidson would be pul-
ling out of the conference
effective July 1, 1977.

Athletic Director Thom
Cartmill indicated that the
Southern Conference is very
much interested in keeping the
Wildcats in the conference.

“The Southern Conference
has expressed a strong inter-
est in our not divorcing our-
selves from the conference. We
are still a member of the
conference and will be such
until June 30.

“There is a strong feeling in
the conference to have us stay
in because we can add a great
deal to their basketball portion
of the conference which is
quickly becoming the main
focal point of the conference.”’

~Cartmill pointed out that
the winner of the Southern
Conference receives an auto-
matic bid to NCAA Tourna-
ment competition.

“‘This would be the most
severe loss we would suffer,”
he explained.

Cartmill said that a final
decision would have to be
reached before July 1. The
decision would rest in the
hands of the trustees.

He did say‘that he did think
that it would be ‘‘wise to
review our situation. We have
to consider two things, first
our basketball program and
then post-season competition
for our young people.”’

He pointed out that there
would be few scheduling prob-
lems if Davidson did pull out
of the conference. He indicated
that there were some problems
in both basketball and some
secondary sports in the area of
post-season competition.

‘‘In basketball we don’t
foresee any scheduling prob-
lems because Davidson has an
established name in basket-
balls: ,

‘‘We would hope that the
majority of our Southern Con-

ference opponents would con-
tinue to schedule us and we
would like to schedule them.
“We still have a national
reputation so that the Notre
Dames, the Ohio States, the

artmill
N.C. States would still con-
tinue to schedule us,’’ he
explained.

If Davidson does withdraw
from the conference the school
would first seek to join a
conference where Davidson
could be competitive in a wide
range of sports.

Cartmill expressed some
concern, however, about the
feasibility of this.

“In modern day athletics it
is very difficult to have an
across-the-board conference
from the standpoint that there
is such diversification within a
school.

‘‘Tt is our first desire cer-
tainly to be in a conference
that would serve all sports,
but our second choice would be
to bein a basketball confer-
ence.”

““My dream for the future is
to have a building that would
include indoor tennis courts
and an indoor-outdoor swim-
ming facility. I am especially
concerned with increasing our
indoor facilities because they
will give the students a wider
range of opportunities during
the winter,’’ he explained.

Currently, Davidson has an
outdated swimming pool, and
lacks an adequate number of
intramural athletic fields, bas-
ketball courts, and racketball
and squash courts.

Senior Jonathan Washburn
commented on the swimming
pool: ‘“‘I have never seen
another school that has a
4-lane pool. Most schools have

6 lanes and some even have 8

lanes.

“Tt ‘is very difficult to
practice with only 4 lanes
because it is so crowded. We
also have a problem getting
other swimming teams to
come here to compete because
they can only enter two swim-
mers in each event.”’

In action this past weekend
Davidson lost two close meets.
Old Dominion won 62-54 last
Friday, and William and Mary
edged the Cats 59-54 on Sat-
urday.

Cartmill realizes what the
most pressing problems are.
‘‘My.top priorities include
building new intramural bas-
ketball courts, new racketball
and squash courts, and a new
swimming facility.’’

Two new fields have already
been leveled and, as soon as
the grass is planted, they can
be used by intramural sports,

Cartmill’s plan for future

the women’s field hockey
team, and club sports. These
fields are much larger than the
current fields. :

However, two of the present
intramural fields (#3 and #4)
will no longer be available
because they are part of the
first hole of the golf course
which has already been part-
ially completed.

Cartmill commented, ‘“‘We
have almost completed one
hole on the golf course. This
summer I hope to put in the
green and I hope it will not-be
too long before we can com-
plete three holes. In the fu-
ture, I plan to complete a
nine-hole course.

“At the present time, I am
trying to determine a site for a
building that will have an
indoor-outdoor swimming pool
and indoor tennis courts. The
pool will have diving facilities,
six lanes, and a movable
bulkhead.

The bulkhead separates the
swimming area and the diving
area and can‘be adjusted for
races of 25 yards or 25 meters.

“This building would be
operated in a club type of
arrangement with the towns»
people paying a fee for use of
the facilities.”’

The basic obstacle to Cart
mill’s plans are a lack of funds.
He is counting heavily on the

«365 million dollar fund drive
and outside donations.

The work that has already
been done on the golf course
and the intramural fields has
been funded by money out of
the athletic department's cap
ital expenditures budget.
