On The Objectification of Women in Advertising

By Gail Ruff

The film Still Killing Us Softly
by Jean Kilbourne, shown as part
of National Women’s History
Month, brought to light the impor-
tant problem of sexism in advertis-
ing. Sponsored by The Committee
for Women’s Issues, the film ad-
dressed problems of the portrayal
of women in advertising. These
problems affect each of us every
day, shaping the way that women
view themselves, the way that men
view women, and the way that
women are treated in day to day
life.

A central problem in advertis-
ing is that women in advertise-
ments are usually beautiful, white,
and thin. This creates a stereotype
saying that all women must be
beautiful, white, and thin to be
considered valuable and to be
socially accepted:

With women in advertising
looking like sticks, itis hard for the
average woman to be proud of her
body. Ads tell women that in order

for them to be considered attrac-
tive, they need to be extremely
skinny. This is not only unrealis-
tic--it is very unhealthy. One out
of every five female college-aged
students has some sort of eating
disorder. Mostofthese women are
not actually overweight, though

be viewed as a valuable human
being.

It is this objectification of
women that leads to devaluation of
women and to violence against
women. If a human being is por-
trayed as an object, then violence
against them is more easily justi-

Advertising plays a critical role in the way that women and
their bodies are viewed by society as a whole.

they consider themselves to be so.

Perhaps the worst problem of
the portrayal of women in adver-
tising is that advertising makes
women into objects. In many ads
only specific parts of a woman’s
body are shown, such as the but-
tocks, the legs, or the face. This
dissection of the body further leads
to the objectification of women.
The message being presented is
that women are only valuable for
their body parts. If a woman be-
comes an object, then she cannot

Fun With Our Heads
And Sharp Objects.

Ah, spring is in the air. Flow-
ers are blooming, trees are bud-
ding, birds are singing, and
Davidson’s above average students
are starting to frolic in pairs once
again as they begin to feel the sap
rising within their well-exercised
bodies. Well.... at least the trees are
budding. But the trees aren’t the
only thing that budded over the
break.

The discerning student has
probably noted that several pairs
of broad, masculine shoulders on
campus have lately been adorned
with shorn heads. Be it fuzzy,
bristly, or just plain bald, the “skint”
head seems tobe the hot doo for the
season. This fresh, daring approach
to coiffurature may just be one
that’s going to last.

Contrast the shorn head to this
past winter’s quick-dying fad,
facial hair. The new doo has innu-
merable advantages over the un-
sightly beard. Please indulge me
while I reveal just a few of these to
the bright readers that have an eye
for both fashion and utility. We'll
call this list the “TOP 10 REA-
SONS TO SHAVE YOUR
HEAD.” Here goes:

1)Food gets trapped in even the
most well-kept beard, making for
an embarrassing nighton the court,
depending on one’s choice of cui-
sine. But nary ascrap will lingeron
your “no-stick” bald head.
2)Originality. While several beard
patterns are out on the market, they
all begin to look similar. Imagine
your humiliation on appearing at a
formal danceand finding that some
poser has the same beard you do.
Nota problem witha shaved head,
as no two people in the world have
the same skull shape.
3)Equity. Most fashions are ex-
clusive and therefore unfair. Just
as many people cannot afford a
sporty new Beemer, there are a

number of unfortunates who can-
not grow facial hair. But the shaved
head is a fashion that can be en-
joyed by both the haves and the
have-nots.

4)Maintenance. Gone are the days oe ane

fied. Violence against things is not
considered as bad as violence
against a specific person with a
name and a personality.

Violence against women is also
trivialized in advertising. One ad
showed the stationary body of an

obviously battered woman with a

new shoe on the ground beside her.
The ad stated that X brand of shoes
can take a beating. The woman
who had been wearing the shoe
obviously could not. Battering is
portrayed as a joke, rather than the

very serious issue that it is.

When sexuality is associated
with violence, the implication is
that women are sex objects that are
dispensable and unimportant. This
leads to the myth that women actu-
ally wantto be beaten, which leads
to problems such as rape and
woman battering. Violenceagainst
women is a severe problem in our
culture and before it can be com-
pletely wiped out, the glamoriza-
tion of it must cease.

It is important to realize that
advertising does not necessarily
cause the problems faced by
women in our society. It does,
however, directly contribute to
these problems. Advertising plays
acritical role in the way that women
and their bodies are viewed by
society as a whole.

Women must learn to have
positive images of themselves as
valuable human beings. This is
hard with constant adverse bom-
bardment from the media. To stop
the cycle of advertisers’ dictation

of what women should be, women
need to divorce themselves from
these images. We must educate
ourselves about sexist advertising
and then refuse to buy the products
advertised in a sexist way.

The solution will not be simple,
but it can begin immediately with
the refusal to buy magazines that
perpetuate stereotypes of women,
the refusal to purchase needless
cosmetic items, and avoidance of
any products advertised in a way
that glorifies violence against
women or that contributes to the
objectification of women.

There is no reason for women
to believe the things that we are
being told by advertisers, and as
soon as we realize that these im-
ages are wrong, we can become
closer to freedom from the damag-
ing stereotypes.

DEPTH, RELEVANCE! Just a

By David Scott

According to the most recent
cover of TIME magazine the
American consciousness has been
engulfed by simplicity. Yuppies
have finally succumbed as a race
and Beemers are boring. The
“Power Lunch” seems sort of silly
and, officially speaking, The
Simple Life is in. Davidson sen-
iors particularly stand to benefit
from this development.

For one thing, jobs are passé.

Unless you plan to earn your keep
crushing apples ina Vermontcider
mill or fondling a milk cow, bag it.
More than likely any occupation
you find will only dull your sense
of enviro-spiritual symbiosis with
all that IS, or at least cramp your

style. So, as Mr. Rogers might put
it, “Can you say ‘Hallelujah’ boys
and girls? I knew you could,”
TIME also noted an evolving
sense of enlightened materialism
in American culture. Cool people
now. use extremely obsolete ob-
jects. Foam and twin blades have
been edged outby the straightrazor
and shaving brush, progressive
individuals can be pinpointed by
their ancient, old-fashioned auto-
mobiles, and the makers of the
“Wacky Wall Walker” have ze-
placed the beloved octopus with a
more family oriented figurine.
“It’s face of theclassic Ameri-
can grandmother,” stated a com-
pany spokesperson. “Sort of a
combination of Betsy Ross and

that make America such a great

planned a simple trip in our practi- _

And we made it. As a Lined
