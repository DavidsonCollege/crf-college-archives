EPC Holds Open Meeting,
Expounds Coeducation Plan

By BOB HOWELL
Asst. Managing Editor

In an open meeting Monday
the Educational Policy Com-
mittee (EPC) fielded questions
from faculty and students con-
ceming the report encouraging
coeducation which the commit-
tee 1eleased last week.

The meeting was directed by
Frofessor Brown Patterson, who
chaired the subcommittee which
pu. tugether the report for the
EPC.

The panel consisted chiefly of
members of the subcommittee
and was frequently assisted by
responses from Vice President
for Academic Affairs John M.
Bevan and Vice President for

Seniors Choose Loan Fund
As Gift For Future Students

By BILL GIDUZ
Asst. Managing Editor

This year’s senior class has
decided to leave a student loan
fund as its legacy to Davidscu.
Senior Class President Bill Lear
made the announcement Wed-
nesday and said pledges for the
turd will be solicited starting
Mcoday.*

“The idea behind a_ student
loan fund is to leave Davidson
something more meaningful than
a bench or a flagpole plaque,”
Lear said. He also pointed out
that ‘‘we especially liked the
idea of this type of gift because
it is not a gift \o the adminis-
tration or college officials, it is
specifically intended for  stu-

also found that professors should
make a mo:e conscious effort
to deal with the problem of
spots of tests. Bevan explained,
“A professor has to do more
than pick ques ions from old
reviews when he makes out a
new one.”

He added, “1 realize that it is
d.ffieult to think up new ways
of asking a question. However,
this is where the ingenuity of
the professor comes in.”

It came to the attention of the
committee that a student, by
looning over three previous re-
views of a certain course, would
know all the answers for his
upcoming review.

Among the recommendations
made was that s.udents show a
willingness to voice an opinion
abuut the inadequacies of a
course 16 the protessor. If this
proves unfruitful, the student
should realize that he should
voiee his complaints with the
chairman of the department.

lf necessary, the student
s.ould feel free to voice his
complairts with the Vice Presi
dent for Academic Affairs, ‘In.
dividuals should fee) free to talk
ahout the strengths or weak-
nesses, of a course,” added Be.
van. “This is not done to hold
someone responsible, but it is
done to explore the. causes of
trouble.”

The faculty has been made
cognizant of some of these prob
lems.

It is hoped that mimi-granis
will be used for the improve.
ment of instruction. If a profes-
sor has a_ new teaching ap.
proach he would like to try in
his classes, financial backing
should be available.

The expansion of outside eval-
uators appears to be a need.

Last year the Psychology and
Eccoomics Departments made
use of outside examiners. Bevan
believes that at least every four
years departments should be
evaluated. These ouiside evalu.
ators should prepare a written
report on the strengths and
weaknesses of faculty and stu.
dents in the respective depart
ments.

Davidson hopes to purchase
videotape machines so that fac
ulty members will have the op
portunity to see themselves in
lecture, discussion or seminar
Situations. This will be volun-
tary, and the faculty member
need be the only one to view
the film.

It is hoped that the syllibi of
all courses can be placed on
file in the library so that inter-
ested studenis will have a bet-
to. understanding of the mature
and requirements of courses be-
fore signing up for them.

dents and only students.”

Lear formed a committee of
20 seniors a month ago to come
up with an idea for a class gift.
They decided on either a loan
fund or a coed scholarship, and
a poll of the members of the
senior class showed a definite
preference for the loan fund.

Ultimately, the goal for the
fund is $10,000. This is to be col-
lected by donations of $10 per
year for five years by 200 mem-
bers of the senior class.

‘‘We wanted to be ambitious
in the amount of money we col-

lected, because it takes a lot’

for a fund like this to be effec-
tive.”

Lear went on to say that the
fund will be administered by
Dean of Studcuts Will Terry and
that any Davidson student may
request a loan from it. Initially,
loans will have to be limited to
about $100 becaisse of the size
of the fund in its first few years,
but when the total of $10,000 is
reached, $500 loans will be avail-
able. The interest rate for loans
will be coly 3 per cert per year,
and Lear commented that this
adds up to almost nothing on a
small, short term loan. :

Lear expressed his hope that
all seniors will help in the drive
by saying, “I don’t think this is
asking too much from any s‘u-
dent, particularly considering
the need in this area at David-
son. | sincerely hope that the
class will support this drive
wholeheartedly.”

Finance and Development C.
David Cornell.

Much of the discussion cen-
tered on the financial aspects
of the proposed plan. Professor
George Abernethy questioned
the advisability of instituting a
program for which the facilities
had not all been secured.

Cornell granted that there was
a certain element of risk in-
volved, but he outlined pro-
g:ams by which the college
would be able to keep up finan-
cially with coeducation.

He referred to the seaticn of
the report calling for a $12.55
million increase of the present
endowment, and emphasized
that, “this increase would be
over the next 10 years and does
trot necessarily mean a $1.2 mil-
lic’ increase each year.”

Cornell stressed the need to
expand the development pro-
gvam.

In response to the question of
where the emphasis for recruit-
ing female students would be,
Patterson stressed the impact
that the present student body
could have in getting the word
out.

Bevan indicated that the in-
tcution was to “‘first aim for
second year transfer students
and then phase in freshman
women the succeeding years.”

Therefore, the initial informa.
tion would go out to 400 select-
ed junior colleges, he said, with
material sent to high school
counselors for distribution next
fall.

Professor Alan Brinkley voic-
ed concern over the student-
faculty ratio rising from 11:1 to
13:1.

Patterson replied that the
committee had tried to arrive
at the best plan taking all as-
pects into ccnsideration, includ-
ing the financial implications of
hiring additional faculty mem-
bers.

Addressing himself to other
questions concerning additional

faculty members, Bevan noted
that the specific areas of the
new faculty could be better de-
termined after a few years,
when the academic directions in
which female students will move
could be perceived.

Patteison added that as the
opportunity arose to add faculty
members, major emphasis
would be placed on hiring wom-
en to fill these positions.
