Grapplers tumble

In the recent wrestling meet
with Lynchburg the older,
more experienced wrestlers
once again provided the wins
for Davidson.

Junior Pat Dulaney won by
a score of 14-5; Glenn Ballard,
the team’s only senior, cap-
tured a 7-5 win and Pete
Johnson came on strong in the
last period to secure a draw.

Rob King wrestled well in
the heavyweight division, pin-
ning his opponent.

Unfortunately these wins
could not offset those of

Lynchburg; the match ended
35-15 with the Wildcats on the

short end of the score.

Ballard, the team’s captain,
saw some good things in the
match, however.

‘We fell into many situ-
ations that we should not
have, but on the whole the
team wrestled better than it
has all season and our steady
improvement should con-

tinue.” ;
Davidson wrestles Pfeiffer

later this week. Ballard feels
the two teams are well
matched and that Davidson
has a very good chance of
winning.

Cats face potent Irish team

By GARY WINTON
Staff Writer

When asked if his cagers
can stay on the court with
Notre Dame’s Fighting Irish
on their home court this
Saturday, Davidson Head
Coach John Kochan responded

with an emphatic ‘‘Yes!”’

“We can give them a hell ot
a game up there,”’ insists
Kochan. ‘‘The team has been
practicing well and the spirit is
good. The recent losses have
not got us down.”’

The Cats had better be up
for this one. Notre Dame,
currently ranked fourth na-
tionally with a 14-2 overall
record, is strong— awesome is
more like it—where Davidson
has been weakest: in the front
court. The Irish sport a big,
talented front line of 6711”,
250 Ib. Bill Laimbeer, 6’8’’,
220 lb. Bruce Flowers and
leading scorer and rebounder,

9’’, 230 lb Dave Batton.

This is not to say that the
guards are weak. The fact that
pre-season all-American guard
Don ‘‘Duck”’ Williams is play-
ing a backup role to starters
Rich Branning and Ron Car-
penter gives some indication
of their strength in this area.

Swimmers maul J.C. Smith

Davidson’s swimmers
raised their record to a re-
spectable 8 and 3 mark with a
60-50 victory over the Golden

_ Bulls of Johnson C. Smith this
past Tuesday. The Cats domi-
nated the meet despite the
close score.

This past weekend the team
won two other meets over
Georgia St. and Augusta Col-
lege while losing a close one to
Georgia Tech.

The scores at the. Augusta
and Georgia State meets were
64-35 and 66-47 respectively.
Georgia Tech beat Davidson
by a narrow 59-54 margin.

The highlight of the State,
Tech meet was Mark Tommer-
dahl’s school record breaking
performance in the 1000 yard
freestyle. Tommerdahl, refer-
red to as the “Animal” by his
teammates, o.722- therace in.a
time of 10:18.5, eclipsing 3%
seconds off his own record.

‘“‘T was pleased with the
record but I believe there is
room for improvement,’’ Tom-
merdahl said.

Coach Pat Miller. was
pleased with Tommerdahl’s
swim and the efforts of the
team as a whole.

She emphasized that “the
team continued to improve its
times.’’ She feels that “more
school records will be broken

in these last two anda half
weeks of the season. Mark’s
new record is only the begin-
ning.”

This weekend the Wildcats
will miss the Mid-Winters
festivities as they travel to
Charleston, S.C. to face a
tough Citadel squad. The meet
should be very competitive as
the Cats go for their ninth
victory.

Along with Williams, fresh-
man Tracy Jackson (6’5’’),
Kelly Tripucka (6’7"), Orlando
Woolridge (6'8’’), and sopho-
more Bill Hanzlik (6’7’’) have
been called onthis year for
extensive duty.

In addition, one has to
consider Notre Dame’s im-
pressive home-court record
and Davidson’s 30 away game
losing streak.

Still, Kochan maintains
that Davidson might surprise
some people. He explains,
“This young Davidson team
has a lot of potential and is
certainly capable of winning
the big one.

The Fighting Irish are a
variety of offenses and de-
fenses and, according to Notre
Dame Sports Information Di-
rector Roger Valdiserri, will
not key on high-scoring guard
John Gerdy, but will instead
concentrate on stopping the
Cats as a unit. Valdiserri
explains, “It’s Coach (Digger)
Phelp’s philosophy to worry
about the whole team, not just
one player. Gerdy could score
40 and Davidson could lose, or
he could score 15 and they
could win.’

The game will be broadcast
on Channel 36 (WRET) at 4:00
pm this Saturday.
