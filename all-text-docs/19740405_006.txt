Evolution of Davidson, Part II

Davidson Endures Attitude Changes

By WOUDY CONNETTE

‘To show good sense in dealing
with things and to talk with
people is no hard matter, and lies
within anyone's power. for the
mind and the heart were there
before learning and human
wisdom....The trouble is that we
live far from ourselves and have
little wish to get any nearer to
ourselves. Indeed we are running
away all the time to avoid
coming face to face with our real
selves, and we barter the truth
for trifles.”’

- From ‘‘The Way of a Pilgrim”

Imagine Alumni Weekend, and a
“representative’’ panel of Davidson
Seniors is discussing this relevant-
chic topic before the assembled doc-
tors, lawyers, and preachers. The at-
mosphere is tensely noncontroversial.
But as each student phrases his
reflections on changes that have oc-
curred during his tenure, conflicting
ideas and attitudes turn the
‘‘discussion"’ into a meaningless wad
of contradiction and polite argument.

Serious examination of attitude
changes must first acknowledge the
fact that there are numerous
meanings for the idea of change. With
that in mind, let's take a look at the
toil and pilgrimage of the Class of ‘74
since ‘70.

Our class is one that was caught
without particular distinction bet-
ween previous students steeped in
social causes and activism, and sub-
sequent students characterized by
self centeredness and skepticism.

We came to Davidson, the pride of
our hometowns, and began to
assimilate the ways of our elders. We
let our hair out and began to observe
what it was to be liberal. We spoke in
jargon of acid and the Dead, although
few of us had experienced either. And
naturally, we took up the crosses of
the day. We were in favor of the en-
vironment, against the slaughter of
animals for their fur, and in support of
workers everywhere.

Meetings and organization were the
media of the day. Whether for or
against the war, we wrote letters,
argued, went to Washington, only to
run when it rained or when the mace
was sprayed.

This form of social activism
lingered throughout the spring of °72
when we were sophomores. Its
malady was overorganization, and I
mark its death by the last political
march held on campus. The rallying
point was some now-forgotten act in
the War, and leaflets distributed on

Thus, overorganization killed the
sponteneity and human aspects of
social activism. I will not say in
eulogy that idealism is dead, for this
would be to defeat all purpose for
future human endeavor. Com-
pounding the problem of
overorganization, however, was the
fact that Davidson had begun and con-
tinues yet to take on a new type of
student.

While our predecessors had been
Striving for social change through
various channels, these younger
students had been mere babes ab-
sorbing their parents’ middle class
conservative backlash to the campus
activism of the late sixties.

Wha Buicks, Buckley and the
Bourgeoise. Money and Banking have
done for me.

So students that came along after us

1970

have been more conservative and
their parents are largely to blame.
But as these students began to fill the
ranks emptied by earlier students, we
too began to assume a more moderate
posture.

‘Inward reflection” is what thepress
has mercifully called this new cam-
pus trend. But I would call it self-
centeredness, there is little reflection
involved in our apathy. Whatever the
cost, our primary goal has become
graduate school acceptance. Fighting
each other in the horse race for
grades during the week left no
time to consider the plight of other
people, and weekend blowouts have
saved us from having to realize the
sensitivity involved in human
relationships.

Davidson seems more .imaginative
and innovative than it was four years
ago. thanks to the efforts of a handful
of faculty members. As freshmen.
student demand for academic
flexibility and reform far outran
faculty support.

Since that time. there has been a
trend reversal as students eying
graduate study have become less
daring in their approach to learning
As a result, the opportunities today
for imaginative. independent. and
service-oriented study are more abun-
dant than student interest.

On the other hand, there are res-
pects in which Jerry Farber’s ob-
servation that “students are niggers ”
is as true today as ever before. We
still e in Tom and Jerry games
with the faculty, and both teams
adhere to well known rules. On mat-

ters of college policy, we are allowed
a certain degree of negotiation. But if
concessions ensue, we as students are
expected to accept the changes as a
“‘gift’’ from the administration and
faculty. In a similar manner, dor-
matories are off limits for the faculty.
I wonder how many professors can
even name all of the dorms.

One of Whitehead’s more noted ob-
servations is of the growing
separation between the practical and
theoretical sources of society. In a
similar vein, I would say that there is
too often a split between people who
are descriptive and those who are per-
ceptive. One requires a literary
background with rigorous study; the
other entails continuous development
of the art of observation. Our system

think on their feet. What we are
hearing therefore. is generally cold
and often several years old.

Where is the professor who can
guide students into new channels of
thought? Is he lecturing and an-
swering questions. or is he discussing
and asking questions? Do we as
students really care? Discouraging ©
answers discourage questioning.

Attitudes toward Davidson as an in-
stitution rise and fall according to
predictable variables. Right now,
morale is peaking due to (1)
coeducation. (2) a 60 percent increase
in admissions applications, (3) warm
weather, and (4) the number of
seniors who know what they will be
doing next year.

The times when Davidson has been
most despised are typically during
cold, rainy spells when the basketball
team is losing and there are no grand
social events to anticipate. No one
seems to talk much during those
times. and loneliness becomes
manifest in frequent naps. pinball
playing. and drunkenness

Because of the trendish nature of
these attitudes. there is no true
change involved Davidson. like the
South it suckles, endures

Looking at the Davidson student as
a person. it can be said that there has
been remarkably little change. The
recent student survey for the Self
Evaluation Committee showed a
general disdain for psychiatric coun-
seling. ‘I can take care of myself.” I
hear us saying. Yes. we're rough.
tough. and rugged. We don't want
human sexuality counseling (ac-
cording to the survey). We don't need
a gynecologist (ditto). but for
Chrissake, give us an abortion
referral service!

Being a senior means finally
outgrowing the characteristically
Davidson habit of counting the num-
ber of hours one slept the night before.
It means no longer boasting of the

number of successive allnighters one
endured under that last burst of
speed. It means once again being able
to look at people's faces and to hear
what they are not saying.

Ah, sweetness, the Davidson gen-
tleman still trips over the parlour
games that present day versions of
Southern Belles so love to play. And
even the most earnest woman chooses
not to see through our what-kind-of-
man-reads-Playboy facades. Like the
Tsarist pilgrim, we now and forever-
more prefer our images to ourselves.
