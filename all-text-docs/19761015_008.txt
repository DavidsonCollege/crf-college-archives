Farrell’ s gridders tie winlessh
Randolph-Macon team 0-0

By STAN BROWN
Staff Writer

Offensive inconsistency and
a strong defense characterized
the Wildcat football team at
Randolph-Macon last Satur-
day.

The result was a 0-0 tie
against what was reputed to
be the weakest team on Dav-
idson’s schedule.

Randolph-Macon is a
NCAA Division III school
without a win this season. The
Cats found themselves in the
unusual position of being fav-
ored and by a large, 17-point
margin.

However, the inability of
the offense to generate a
balanced attack proved the
predictors wrong.

For the first time this year,
the Cats gained more than 100

yards in a game, rolling up a
reasonable 227 yards. But
they failed to complete a single
pass and the zero in passing
yardage hurt.

Certainly it was a far cry
from the days of Harper,
Shipp, Pomeroy, Walker.

Yet despite the lack of
balance the Wildcats had two
opportunities to score.

In the second quarter, with
a first down at the six, three
running plays netted four
yards. Faced with a fourth
down at the two, Davidson
chose to go for it and lost a
yard.

In the last period, the
offense mounted its best drive
of the season, reeling off five
first downs and advancing to
the Randolph-Macon six yard
line. However, a lost fumble

AFTER a disappointing loss at a four-way meet at Appala-

on first down let another
scoring opportunity slip away.

The defense was, again, the
only bright spot for the Wild-
cat fans. In limiting the
opposition to 175 yards, they
effectively bottled up Rand-
olph-Macon’s offense.

Only once did Randolph-
Macon threaten to score.

Following a Cat fumble at
the Davidson 28, the other
team moved it to the three
yard line. There, the Wildcats
twice stopped line plunges on
third and first, and fourth and
first situations to take over
the ball.

Coach Farrell expressed dis-
appointment in his team’s
performance. This Saturday,
the Wildcats will go after their
first win against Madison
College for the Homecoming.

Title IX discussed

[Continued from page 1]

“T think the first two years
the girls felt they had to prove
themselves to the institution
and the community,’’ said
Jean Parks, member of the
Title IX Self Study Com-
mittee.

Parks said some men stu-
dents who ‘“‘for lack of a better
word I’Il call chauvinistic,”’
had to change their attitudes
toward women. Some did, but
some men wouldn’t, according
to her. ‘“‘Some weren’t afraid
to let that be known,’’ she

said.
Both: Parks and Dietler feel

blatant discrimination has, for
the most part, disappeared on
campus, but that Title IX is
still needed.

“I see a need for it, because I
thought it was a good way
after five years of coeduca-
tion to look at coeducation and
to see if we’ve accomplished
the original goals for coeduca-
tion,’’ said Dietler.

“It was also needed to the.

extent that at different times
throughout the year rumor
had it that students wanted to
change this, that, or another,

and Title IX allows for that to
happen,” she continued.

“T think (Title IX} may
encourage the girls to make
the complaints that they can
back up with legality, but I
don’t know if people will use
the procedures,’’ said Parks.
“‘T’ll be real curious to see
that.”

“Because of Title IX the
campus is more aWare of what
discrimination is by using
Title IX as a guide,’’ said
Dietler.

She believes it will help
counteract unconscious dis-
crimination. “‘That’s precisely
the point,’’ she said. ‘‘Some
people believe certain things
and don’t feel they’re discri-
minating, and have good rea-
sons to do the things they do.
This is frustrating to the
person who feels he or she is
discriminated against.”’

Dietler feels that Title IX as
an educational process ‘‘helps
people to reflect on things they
consider to be tradition.’’ Tra-
ditions can be evaluated, and
maybe be replaced by new
customs.

““The presence of coeds
themselves made us develop
an awareness and sensitivity
to any discrimination as well
as the normal things that go
with discrimination,’’ said
Director of Personnel and
Chairman of the Title IX Self
Study Committee Robert Ste-
phenson.

“I don’t anticipate anything
earth-shaking as a result of
Title IX because the com-
munity was already sensitive
to those things in Title IX, but
it will serve as a means of
keeping the issue in front of us
at all times, as a tool to keep
the rights of men and .women
up front,” he said.
