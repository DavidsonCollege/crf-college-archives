Dr. Hood Tells
Of His Hobbies

(Continued from Page 5)

Statesville, whom Dr. Hood calls his
master,
But we wanted to get to the bottom

of things, to see the shop that so many
had spoken of. Out past the garage we
were taken to an unusually wide door
with remarkably long and strong [nglish
hinges, through which we walked, expect-
ing to see that scene of genial and cosy
disorder so familiar to workshops. But
all was in perfect order. Here were other
evidences of trips to England, particu-
larly a very small, delicate-looking hand

saw with the tiniest teeth. It was pecu-

liar, we thought, that all the English
tools in sight had fancy, ornamental
handles, while the American-tiade-ones

were ruggedly individualistic and plain
as barn-doors.

An impression remains of such things

like) on little steel tables that tilt crazily

“mouth-pieces,’

a gaping .cedar-chest all ready to have
its top fitted, a bundle of meter-length
sticks of rosewood for inlaying the lid
of the chest and some new instruments
that the writer never had seen before,
interesting because of unfamiliarity.

After “Oh-ing” and “Ah-ing” over all
this industry and skill, while secretly
feeling a little envious, we went back in
the house, where we found that the doc-
tor had not consumed all his spare time
in wood-working. He had a lot of old
books in his library, not at all confined
to one subject. According to a note in
the musty flyleaf of a volume of Burke's
complete works, “this was shipwrecked
(vith me in 1817,” It is signed “Earl Am-
herst.” And although we generally think
of Thomas Hood as the writer of dole-
ful, serious poems, that he wrote comedy
also is evidenced by the “Comic Annual,”
which he bronught out in the middle of
the nineteenth century and continued for
years. But the oldest
book is an incredible looking thing issued
in 1658—"The Larger and Lesser” West-
minister Confessions of Faith.

several doctor’s

From another room then the doctor
brought in what at first sight was an
ash-tray, having a queer curved rib over
it, apparently for a handle. Surprise was
complete when we found it to be an old
stirrup that his wife’s sister had brought
back from China. This is only typical of
the collections, which include an exceed-
ingly ancient clay inscription from
Abraham’s home town, a crude Jupiter
from the Forum Fomanum, an Anne-of-
Brittany caryatid that looks like a woman
only by implication, and a saucer-size
memorial to John Calvin, from Geneva,
dating back from 1909. Quite a collec-
tion is the doctor's, really.
