A banker today is a lot more than a money
specialist who waits for the community to come
to him. He’s a well-rounded, imaginative indi-
vidual who knows how to present a package of
financial services to fill his client’s needs. He’s
professionally involved with every kind of busi-
ness, from government to space exploration to
problems of emerging nations. And he can’t be
pigeonholed because versatility is one of the

keys to his success.

He has job status and pride of profession.
And his compensation and employee benefits

are the envy of many.

His training is thorough and guided by expe-
rienced seniors who cushion the rough spots
and put him on the high road when he’s ready

Before you make your big career decision,
take a long look at banking, Ambition is the
key, and the best way to check yourself out is
to set up a give-and-take session with a Chase
Manhattan Banker.

One more thing.

Modern banking is in. It asks for versatile,
creative, imaginative men who want to range
the community, the nation and the whole wide
world.

Discuss the possibilities of a carcer in modern
banking. A Chase Manhatlan banker will be on
campus soon. Your Placement Office will tell you
when and where. \
