A TO gives House
year’s easiest win

By THE
BODACIOUS TA-TA’S

Due to the nonfeasance of
the referees this week we are
coerced into spouting forth a
column laden with inanity. We
shall endeavor to present the
straight goods and the editors
can attest to the fact that our
veracity cannot be denied (in
most cases).

ATO opted for the relative
safety of a benign food fight
rather than submit their
woeful bodies to imminent
emulsification by The House,
a band of freshmen hellians
living off-campus whose
humble stereos make a Stones
concert sound like the Ladies’
Auxiliary.

The .House inevitably
gained its easiest victory of
the year but probably would
have been easier if ATO had
showed up. When reached for
comment, Father Tom
Besselieu could only say, ‘‘He
threw the pudding at me
first!’’

The hard-headed Bongs
made a feast of the delectable
EMBO and smoked them
592-342. Drinks were provid-
ed by the effervescent Bill
“Drinking Machine’ Ander-
son who passed out while
scoring, thus explaining the
questionable 3% points.

Fortunately the contest
between Fiji #8 and Bwana
Dick and the Darkies Was a
forfeit. BD and the D’s did not
bother to show up, and thus
saved us the embarrassment
of writing a horribly obscene
paragraph.

October is traditionally a
tranquil month for college
football. The season openers
have already been decided and
the climactic November
struggles and bowl games are
still several weeks away.

For Davidson the story is
quite different. October could
be the month that the Wild-
cats realize their potential and
prove they can win.

However, October could
also be the month that forces
Davidson to come to grips
with the realization that its
current football program is not
succeeding.

On the remaining four
Saturdays of this month,
Coach Ed Farrell’s Wildcats
will face Randolph-Macon,
Madison, and Hampden-
Sydney, all Division III teams
and Guilford College which is
an NAIA team that plays a
predominantly Division III
schedule,

“The schedule is pretty nice
as it is right now. If we get by
Randolph-Macon we come
back. for Homecoming against

WILDCAT ONGGErS leck-oft What may prove to be the turning
point of Coach Farrell’s career against Randolph- Macon
Saturday.

Davidson faces October crossroads,
Farrell’s program could turn corner

Madison. Then we could go to
Hampden-Sydney with two
wins in a row and have more
confidence for that particular
game,’’ explained Farrell.

During Farrell’s tenure, his
Davidson teams have a
combined record of 3-18.
Patience has been the word
from the coach’s office and we
have been reminded that it
takes several years to turn
around a sagging program.

Still, Farrell realizes his
program must produce in the
near future to establish a
degree of credibility.

“The third year of a
program has to show some
notable improvement. We
need wins now to strengthen
the program’s credibility with
the school, players and rec-
ruits. It’s hard to gain some-
one’s confidence when you’re
1-8 in your third year,’’ ex
plained Farrell.

“I don’t say we need to win
all four games or that there is
no hope for our program if we
don’t win them all,’’ he said.

“But if we falter on three or
four Saturdays whn you’re
supposed to win I don’t know

program is heading in the
right direction.”’

Farrell realizes the impor-
tance of the four games this
month but hopes to avoid a
great deal of the pressure that
could surround these games.

“October is a crucial month
but we can’t allow ourselves to
get excited about that and
over react. Every Saturday is
important,” said Farrell.

If the Wildc¢at’s do falter
Coach Farrell is also aware
that he must answer the
critics.

“If we don’t win I’d say we
would have to take a long look
at what we’re doing. I would
sure put me on the carpet and

‘want to know why we weren’t

‘By the same token, if we
come out of the season 5-4 or
6-3 that’s not the end of it
either. Don’t say that next
year we're going to a bowl
game. There still has to be
some consistency developed.’’

Four weeks in October could
tell a great deal about the
Davidson football program
Farrell is optimistic that the
news will be good.

‘We have a real opportunity
to win four football games.
Maybe'the toughest will be the
first one because we just
haven’t won anything signifi-
cant in three years.

‘We're in good shape and
this is a good point for these
games to come.”
