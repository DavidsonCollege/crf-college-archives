: WITH THE ALUMNI :

REUNION OF THE CLASS OF 1876

Rev. A. M. Fraser, pastor of the First
Presbyterian church of Staunton, Va.,
sends the following communication:

At the last commeicement, the class
of 1876 held a reunion in the hall of the
Philanthropic Society and effected an
organization, with W. B. Arrowood as
president, and A. M. Fraser as secre-
tary. This class numbered seventeen at
the time of its graduation, and twelve
of them are still living, after a lapse of
forty years. Seven of the twelve at-
tended the reunion—W. B. Arrowood,
W. F. Carter,.T. B. Craig, A. M. Fras-
er, R. M. Miller, Jr., J. EF. P. Robinson
and E. M. Summerell. The other sur-
vivors were heard from and nearly all
had hoped to attend this reunion. They
are Duncan Rose, L,. A. Simpson, T. A.
Titcomb, J. A. Tyson and B. F. ‘Wat-
kins.

R. M. Miller, Jr., entertained the
class at a sumptuous dinner and pre-
sented each member with a reunion but-
ton. He is an enthusiastic Davidsonian
and president of the Alumni Association.
He will print in pamphlet form sketches
of the members of the class, the living
and the dead. In the preparation ot
this pamphlet he will be assisted by W.
F. Carter, who also worked with him
in the getting of the reunion.

The class decided to have an annual
correspondence among the members, and
toa hold another reunion in 1926 to cele-
hrate the fiftieth anniversary of its grad-
uation. A. M. Fraser, Sec'y.

A SECOND OPEN LE PTER

Fram the Cniversity Cammission on
Southern Race Questions ta the Cal-
lege Men of the Sauth.

In its first open letter to college men
of the South, issued at the beginning of
the present year, the University Com-
mission urged them to unite their efforts
with those of the press, the pulpit, the
bar, the officers of the law, and all other
agencies laboring for the elimination of
the monster evil of mob violence. These
agencies have labored diligently and
with substantial results as is indicated
by the decrease of the average annual
number of Iynchings from 171 for the
decade 1886-1895 to 70 for the decade
1906-1915. Nevertheless the commis-
sion wishes to reiterate its appeal with
renewed emphasis, knowing that the
eradication of so virulent a social disease
as the lynching mania can be effected
only by the prolonged and vigorous ef-
forts of sane an patriotic citizens.

In this letter the commission wishes
to direct the attention of the college men
to the educational aspect of the race
question, inasmuch as the solution of all
human problems ultimately rests upon
rightly directed education, In its last
analysis education simply means. bring-
ing forth all the native capacities of the
individual for the benefit both of himself
and of society. It is axiomatic that a
developed plant, animal, or man is far
more valuable to society than the unde-
veloped. It is likewise obvious that
ignorance is the most fruitful source of
human ills. Furthermore it is as true
in a social as in a physical sense that a
chain is no stronger than its weakest
link. The good results thus far ob-
tained, as shown by the Negro’s progress
within recent years, prompt the commis-
sion to urge the extension of his educa-
tional opportunities.

The inadequate provision for the edu-
cation of the Negro is more than an
injustice to him; it ts an injury to the
white man. The South cannot realize
its destiny if one-third of its population
is undeveloped and inefficient. For our
common welfare we must strive to cure
disease wherever we find it, strengthen
whatever is weak, and develop all that
is undeveloped. The initial steps for
increasing the efficiency and usefulness

lof the Negro race must necessarily be

taken in the school room. “Chere can
hhe no denying that more and better
schools with better trained and better
paid teachers, more adequate supervision
and longer terms are needed for the
blacks as well as the whites. The Negro
schools are, of course, parts of the school
systems of their respective States, and as
such share in the progress and prosperity
of their State systems. Our appeal is
for a larger share for the Negro, on the
ground of the common welfare and com-
mon justice. He is the weakest link in
our civilization and our welfare is in-
dissolubly bound up with his.

Many means are open to the college
men of the South for arousing greater
public interest in this matter and for
promoting a more vigorous public effort
to this end. A right attitude in this as
in all other important public questions
is a condition precedent to success. For
this reason the commission addresses to
Southern college men this appeal.

THE OLDEST GRADUATE,

The honor belongs to North Caro
lina, “The oldest living graduate in’ the
United States is a native of this State
and a graduate of the University. “hes
were trying to claim this distinction for
Doctor Nixon, the Emory College grad
uate who sent a contribution of one-dol-
lar to the Wilson campaign fund, as re-
lated in Monday's paper, and who took
his diploma at Oxford, Ga., in 1845. Mr
Walter Murphy, who knows more
North Carolina history off hand than
any other citizen of the State, gives The
Observer the interesting bit of infor
mation that Francis “l. Bryan, of New-
bern, graduated from the University of
North Carolina in 18y1) and holds the
honor of being the oldest graduate in
this country. He also graduated from
the United States Military Academy at
West Point and that was in 1845, the
vear of Doctor Nixon's graduation at

Oxford. Mr. Bryan is yet living. He
is a resident of St. Louis. where he
made a vast fortune in real estate. He

was born in Newhern in 1820 and. was
one of seven brothers, all of whom were
University graduates. One of these is
Judge Henry R. Bryan. Another
William Shepard) Bryan, formerly As-
sociate Justice of the Supreme Court o
Maryland and whose son is now Attor-
ney General of that State. ‘The win-
ning of distinctions at home or abroad
is a mighty common thing for North
Carolina.—Charlotte Observer.

forerunner to the Davidson-A. & M.

Charlotte.

After a few selections by the Orches-

last year were practised and learned by
nearly all present. Also the songs were
tried out and proved exceptionally good.
Stirring speeches by S. ‘I. Henderson
and E. P. Nisbet emphasized the im-
portance of every man in the Student
Bodv being present at the game to back
up the Red and Black.
