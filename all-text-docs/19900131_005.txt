On with cold beer from cool
places, ay?

Significant comments:

O'Keefe: Not too bitter, has a
little body to it.

“Standard Canadian beer,
perfectly pleasant. I could en-
joy this during a hockey game
definitely.” —Devereux

Glacier Bay: Weak odor, sweet
taste, bland. Not very exciting.
A throw-it-down kind of beer

“T would rather drink some-
thing else during sports.” —
Devereux.

Molson Canadian: Strong, not
offensively unpleasant odor.
Taste dies in the mouth.
"Foretaste, but no. after-
taste.”

“This does not taste mass
produced. It has the small-
town brewery taste” —De-
vereux.

Molson Export: Has flecks
floating around in it. Other-
wise, there is nothing notewor-
thy about it. Not a whole lot
different from Bud, but “you’d
get excited if you thought it
was Canadian. I'll give ita C/
A for taste/flecks” —Scouten

LaBatt’s Blue: White-wine
smell, tart taste vaguely remi-
niscent of pretzels. Heavily
carbonated. Could be drunk
with a meal or with nothing.

beer picks

part of last week's article. The
missing portion has been found
and is reprinted here for your en-
joyment. Sorry, Hutch!]

We found Sun Valley, pur-
chased in San Francisco, to bea
tremendous beer. Unfortu-
nately, it is thought to be un-
available in North Carolina—
hence the choice as “most tan-
talizing.” St. Stan’s was also
came from the West Coast.

Where to buy these beers

With these two exceptions,
however, all of the beers dis-
cussed can be purchased lo-
cally. La’Mart Deli and Wines
(3201 N Sharon Amity Road,
between the intersections. of
Albemarle and Central) has all
of them. Most are also avail-
able at Belk of South Park.

have similar tastes, though
some are more distinctive in
their similarities than others.

quickly ran out of adjectives
and phrases to distinguish

This column is written out of a
concern that, ina quest for quanti-
ties of beer, people too often over-
look the quality.
