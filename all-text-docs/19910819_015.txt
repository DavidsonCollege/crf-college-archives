Senior John Patton Attends Moscow Summit

- By Russ Tisinger

John Patton, asenior political ”

science major, got more than he
bargained for when he received
an internship at the Soviet Desk of
the State Department this summer
in Washington, D.C. Not only did
he manage to take on some impor-
tant responsibilities with the day
to day operation of the desk; he
was eventually chosen from the
staff to help with the U.S.-Soviet
summit in Moscow that took place
at the end of July.

Patton served as an intern for
the multilateral section of the
Soviet Desk, which deals with
U.S.-Soviet arms control issues
and the remaining Cold War-fu-
eled regional conflicts such as
those in Afghanistan, Cuba, and
Cambodia.

The internship entrusted

some important jobs to Patton. One
project he worked on was prepar-
ing Ambassador Robert Strauss for
the Senate confirmation hearings.
He helped write alist of answers to

Davidson in Washington

By Russ Tisinger

Fifteen Davidson students
worked and studied in Washing-
ton, D.C. this summer under the
Davidson-in-Washington pro-
gram. The program, conducted by
the Department of Political Sci-
ence, gave students the opportu-
nity to serve as interns in Washing-
ton, D.C, and to participate in a
seminar taught by Dr. Louis Ort-
mayer.

The topic for the 1991 seminar
was American national, security
policy. Students met twice a week
to study the ins and outs of making
national security policy in Wash-

‘ington, the gradual evolution of
defense policy in the United States,
U.S.-Soviet conventional and
nuclear arms control (specifically
the CFE and START treaties), the

increasingly important role of the
economy on national security pol-
icy in the post Cold War era.

Being in Washington enabled
the students to take advantage of
speakers from the Washington area.
Karl Pfefferkorn, from the Office
of Negotiations of the miei
Department, spoke to studen
about negotiating the Conventional
‘Forces in Europe treaty with the
Soviets.

In addition to going to class,
each student served as an intern in

~ the Washington area. Davidson stu-

dents had internships at the U.S.
Department of Justice, and several
other organizations.

ton" articles above for descrip--
tions of two of the more interesting
Davidson internships.

delegations sent to the Soviet Un-
ion. According to Patton, working
on the booklets allowed him to
gain a better feel for how the Desk
and the State Department actually

tary of

James
Bakerand Soviet Foreign Minister
Alexandr Bessmertnyk over the
START agreement, Patton was
able to sit in on negotiations be-
tween treaty officials. Patton, who
speaks Russian, found the giveand
take of discussion fascinating. At
one point in the negotiations, some

ESoviets (falsely) thought the

Americans were questioning So-
viet technological ability, which
led to some tense moments. Inter-
éstingly, the less formal discus-
sion during the breaks seemed to

"RESERVE O

contribute as much or more to the
negotiations than the formal ses-
sions.

At the end of the summer,
Patton was chosen to help with the
Moscow summit. As part of an
advance team, he arrived a week
before the president to help pre-
pare for the meetings between the
President Bush and General Secre-
tary Gorbachev. During the sum-
mit Patton worked 18 hour days as
a dispatcher, coordinating rides
for officials thatneeded to be taken
around Moscow for whatever rea-
son. Because all of the drivers were
Soviets, he was able to use his
Russian to direct drivers to their
destinations.

Patton also aided President
Bush’s Ambassador of Protocol,
Joseph Reed, with various tasks
during the Moscow leg of the trip.
The ambassador, who takes care of
important details such as aspects
of scheduling, formal presentations
involving the President etc., dele-
gated various responsibilities to
Patton.

For example, just before the
President departed for Kiev to
deliver a speech, Patton delivered
the President’s copy of the speech
to Air Force One.
