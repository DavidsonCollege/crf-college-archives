The Wildcat
Screams Tonight

“This is a chance of a lifetime for me. This is really
an experience. They're probably teaching me more than
I’m teaching them.”

These were the words of Coach Charlie Parker as he}

watched the 1963 United States Pan American Wrestling
Team work on the mats for the first time in Johnston
Gymnasium.

Team Manager Manuel Gorriaran, a Providence,

Rhode Island, manufacturer in his spare time, wandered}
over. “This is one of the best teams that ever went to the}
mat for the United States,” he said. “They should do as}
well as the team that went to the 1959 Pan Am Games.” |

(That team won a gold medal in every weight division.)

From mighty, muscular Joseph Israel James to the |

mustachioed mite Andrew Fitch, this team is a dedicated
group of men who share the common goal of bringing
honor to their country.

No less dedicated are Parker and Gorriaran. Parker :

has long been recognized as an outstanding wrestling
coach in the South. Now he has achieved national recog-
nition by being selected to coach the finest wrestling team

in the country. And he said that as far as he knows, |i

Davidson is the first campus in the South that has ever
been able to host a Pan American or Olympic team.

The very fact that the team is going to the Pan Am
Games; indeed, the very fact that wrestling is included on
the Pan Am program is due to Gorriaran’s influence. In
1933 he persuaded officials of the Central American
Games to include wrestling in their program, and this
tradition has been carried over to the Pan Am Games.

As the wrestlers began warm-up exercises, photo-
graphers called Big Eight Champion James and 1959
National Intercoliegiate Champion Fitch over for publicity
shots. The contrast between the 225 lb. James, who re-

sembled a Herculean gladiator in his wrestling uniform, |
and the 114 lb. Fitch was almost unbelievable. To oblige}

photographers, James lifted Fitch high into the air.
Parker then suggested that Fitch pose lifting James. The
little man stepped back, looked up at his big teammate,
measured his many muscles with a glance, and shook
his head in disbelief.

Parker had imported big Jerry Cabe, a 220 Ib. foot-
ball player and wrestler from UNC, to work with James.
Parker described Cabe as an excellent wrestler for this
part of the country, but James was almost apologetic as
he lifted Cabe over his head and deposited him on the mat
in their first workout.

‘“He’s g

hell.”

Lefty Driesell stepped into the gym for a few min-
utes to watch James work out. As he was leaving, a stud-
ent asked him what he was up to. Lefty replied, “I just
came down to see if Coach Parker needed a heavyweight.”

On the other side of the mat, Fitch was working out
with 125 Ib. Bill Riddle, the Eastern AAU champion of
last year. After a spirited match between those two, Dav-
idson’s Dick Wray bounded onto the mat against Fitch,
but he soon crawled off. “It was like trying to stop a
train,” panted Wray, who had put up an unusually good
fight considering the odds.

Also matched in the practice were 191 lb. Jim Fer-
guson, the only American wrestler ever to finish as hi
as third in a world —— match, and 174 Ib.
Dennis Fitzgerald, former Big Ten champion. Fitzgerald,
the only married member of the team, ad to leave his
wife in Michigan.

After the practice, the quite and reserved James, a
junior at Oklahoma State University, sat resting on a
bench in the locker room. Someone asked him w t he
intended to do after graduation, and James had a rather
surprising answer. A sincere Catholic, he explained that
he is an English major and h to become a writer. “I
have always liked an and I would like to write about
man himself—what he , why he does what he does,
and what part religion plays in his life.” He also explain-
ed that he never takes any weight training to build
muscles. “I just wrestle,” he ‘

He did not have long to rest, however, because Coach

Parker soon had the team running up and down the

Golf Prospects Not Dim
In Conference Tourney

When the dust cleared and the divots stopped flying,
golf coach Tom Scott surveyed his charges an concluded
that while they may have lost a couple of battles, the
prospects are anything but bleak for a victory in their
war to capture the coming Southern Conference tourna-
ment at Myrtle Beach, S. C.

Over the holidays the golf
team dropped matches to Wake
Forest and UNC by decisive
scores, but defeated a strong
alumni team and got in some
practice at the Dunes Club
course at Myrtle Beach in pre
aration for the tournament.

These matches brought the
golfers’ season record to an even
5-5, but all of the losses were to
Atlantic Coast Conference

Bill Ross.
.

In the only freshman golf
match played so far, the David-
son team beat Oak Ridge Mili-
tary Academy in Mooresville on
March 29 by a decisive 22-5.
Davidson's H. W. Covington was
medalist there with a 71, and
F. H. Gibbs and Doug McKeever
also looked good in recording 75
and 78 respectively.

On April 1 and 2, the ’Cats

college championship last year,
6-1 and 9-5. On Wednesday how-
ever, Davidson outmaneuvered
Fort Stewart to gain an 8-7 vic-

| Then Dave Johnson, a sopho-
more pitcher, shut out Mercer's
Baptist best with an 8-0 victory.

The team returned home, but
had to cool their heels when the
William and Mary game was
rained out Friday.

From Davidson the team mov-

lost to a Southern Conference
match while winning four. Scott
feels that his team’s good show-

tition indicate that Davidson
should do well in the tourna-
ment

The Wake Forest squad, which |
Scott describes as “one of the
better teams in the country,”
beat the ’Cats 33-3 in Gastonia
on April 4. Frank McPhillips
was low for Davidson with a 74.
while Wake’s Sam Folkes, North
Carolina amateur champion, was |
overall medalist with a 71.

Then on April 5, Davidson |
came out on the short end of a|
22%-7% score to UNC at the!

that the team as a whole has

good pitching, but is still search- {2 i

ing for better hitting.

Stevens has hopes for Tommy

year, but who has yet to reach

his prime this season. Davidson ;

is now holding on to the hitting
skills of Hamilton, Lance Wal-

Davidson beat Richmond with
a decisive 6-3 score, but in the
Toledo match the ‘Cat netters
dropped 7 of 9 contests, with
Bill Baé¢klund and the doubles
team of Backlund-Baumgardner
being the only home team vic-
tors.

Downed 6-3 by their first
spring tour opponent, Furman,
in Greenville on March 30, the
‘Cats found themselves two days
later on Georgia clay and
thrashed Valdosta State Teach-
ers College, 7-2. April 2, the
Wildcats edged Florida South-
ern 54, at Lakeland, and then
journeyed to Winter Park to
meet Rollins College. The pait-
ing of Billi Schutt and Gene Mc-
Cutchen brought the day’s only
victory as Davidson fell, 8-1.

of Richmond on Mon-

host to the rebounding red and
black and lost 5-2 in DeLand,
Apri! 4. Coach Fogleman called
Stetson the toughest opponent
his racquetmen had met all |
year, and lauded the play of
Gene McCutchen who “possibly
played the best set of his life.”

In Daytona Beach, the squad
encountered a strong Hope Col-
lege team and came out on the
short end of a 5-4 score.

Fogleman noticed steady im-
provement on the trip and feels
that it was good experience for
his team. Rollins, Stetson, and
Florida Southern extended invi-
tations for return matches next
year, and Columbia and Am-
herst were added to the Wild-
cat 1964 home schedule.

The Wildcat track team nipped Presbyterian College 70-60 Wednesday to keep

ney to Greenville for the News-
Piedmont Relays. Whittle noted
that this is always a good meet.
He expects heavy competition
from such schools as Florida
State, Clemson, South Carolina,
Furman, and Tennessee.

Looking ahead to the David-
son Relays on April 27, Whittle
was guardedly optimistic
“Washington and Lee gave us
a real battle last year. I sup
I'd have to call them slight
favorites in this year’s meet
primarily ‘because of their
strength in the relays and field
events.”

po

More schools than ever have
entered the event this year, in
cluding Emory, Lenoir Rhyne
East Carolina, Presbyterian,
High Point and others.

What about prospects for the
rest of the year? “Billy Mills
holds the school record in the
pole vault (12'7") and should
break it soon. Ronnie Reese is
running well in the 880, and
should come in under two min-
utes any meet now. Sterling
Martin will probably break the
school record in the two-mile
run when he meets some real
competition. A boy named Pat-
terson at Furman is about the
only runner in the conference
who can challenge him serious-
ly.”

Whittle noted that the team
strength lies in the relays and
sprints. The weakness of the
team is in the field events, al-
though Keith Frasier holds the
school record in the high jump.

“This is one of the finest sea-
sons we've had,” concluded
Whittle. “I predict we'll finish
the season with seven wins and
two losses (to V.P.I. and Wake
Forest). But even the losses

| should be real close.”
