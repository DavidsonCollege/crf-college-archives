Promotes Interest

It is the object of the Academy
to stimulate interest in the sciences
as well as to promote study and
scientific research. It is through
such an organization that some sci-
entists are able to make known
their discoveries and ideas to the
general public.

Any person actively interested in
science or the, promotion of. sci-
ence may, upon nomination by two
members, be elected a member of
the Academy by a majority vote of
the Executive Committee. At pres-

system, tested and found success-

Youthful Cast Presents ‘Here
Comes Charlie’

The senior class of Davidson
High School, under the direction of
Mrs. F. S. Clark, presented a play

yesterday entitled “Here Comes
Charlie,” by Jay Tobias.
This comedy told of the trials

of young Larry Elliott, metropoli-
tan man, when his rural
cousin Charlie came to visit him.
He was rather disgusted when he
found Charlie to be a female, but
in the end love triumphed and
matrimony was definitely contem-
plated.
