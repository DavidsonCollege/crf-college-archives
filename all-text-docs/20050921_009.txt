Career Services, in an effort to
offer a broader, more diverse
range of career opportunities to
Davidson students, has decided to
expand its offerings to cover new
“gangster” career paths. This deci-
sion has come off research by the
department, which shows that
Davidson students are increasingly
unprepared entering the work-
force in gangster related careers.
Their research also shows tremen-
dous economic growth and oppor-
tunity from those in ganster-relat-
ed careers including rapping,
pimping, drug trafficking, and kid-
napping.

Programs related to these career
paths have already begun this
semester. During Career
Orientation Week, Career Services
passed out pamphlets entitled,
“Guns, girls, and grills: The 3 G’s of
Rapping.” Next week there is a
seminar scheduled in which guest
speaker Dr. Tricka J will lecture on
the fine points of drive-by shoot-

ings and detendtiig your turf. For
the month of October, a series of
workshops entitled “Represent

Your Coast” will bé offered featur-
ing help with your four-finger ring,
bandana, and piece selections.

Josh Bryson and Tim O'Brian ’06 prepare for the Dr. Tricka J
seminar which will be held this Friday in the 900 Room

Finally, in November there will be
a “Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas”
demonstration in the 900 Room.
The Chaplain’s office is even
sponsering a weekly program on
Wednesday nights called “Church
for thugs” which will be held in the
DCPC sanc-

of all the events this semester. “I’m
planning on going to everything,
but I’m especially excited for the
workshop about pushing grass at
Davidson,” Jason said. “I feel like
that could pay-off for me in the
short run as well as the long run.”
