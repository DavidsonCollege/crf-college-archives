IMAC Report

Ta-Ta’s tell all.......

By THE BODACIOUS
TA-TA’s

We recently received a com-
plaint from a reader regarding
the lack:of game scores in our
column. Personally we believe
that nothing is less newswor-
thy than the actual score of an
IMAC game, but we aim to
please, and are more than
happy to provide some scores
this week: 44-34, 30-22, 26-16.

We also have some games to
report. The munchkins of Na-
poleonic Complex rejected Slo-
ppy Seconds, 42-39. Napoleo-
nic Complex was boosted by
Clif ‘Flagrant Foul” Flynn’s
twelve points, and the five
fouls committed by Sloppy
Seconds’ star Rick ‘‘Rack ’Em
Up” Bateman.

By George proved once
again they are not out to win
ballgames. Manned by the
likes of “By George’’ Strobe-
light, Fred Goodwinism,
‘‘Pele’’ Jackson, and Will
“The Hook”’ Reilly, the Geor-
gians were smushed by the
Smidgets, 33-30. The Smid-
gets were paced by the daz-
zling shooting eyes of Dick
Robbins and Phil Mottice,
who scored ten and seven

points respectively.

Mike ‘‘The Pork’’ Peskosky
pumped twelve points into a
balanced PDT #1 scoring at-
tack that dawdled by Mike
“McShootit”’ Schafer, 44-43.
McShootit was periodically
assisted by his back-up bunch,
otherwise known as ‘‘In Your
Eyes”.

SAE #1, behind the net
burning bombs of Stan ‘‘The
Clown” Brown and Dick ‘‘The
Sick’’ Myrick, made an every-
day occurrence out of Phi
Phenomenon, 55-35. Phi Phe-
nomenon, in reality a group of
students from the Mt. Holly
School for Derelict Young
Men, was saved from disgrace
only by Bo ‘‘The Slow”’ Mc-
Grath’s twelve points.

Girls’ basketball this week
was only mildly more inter-
esting. I Haven’ts and Iota
Beta Theta (you are not
fooling us), two female teams,
engaged in a contest that saw
the quick demise of the latter
by the score 18-15. We do have
to admit that it was a close
game, and the scoring was
balanced. Of the eighteen
players present, ten scored no
points.

For leading Davidson out of
the cellar of the Southern
Conference, in basketball
games against East Carolina
and William and Mary, sopho-
more guard John Gerdy has
been named the Wildcat Ath-
lete-of-the- Week.

With what Gerdy claims
was “‘one of our best halves of
basketball all year,” the Cats
jumped to a halftime lead
against the Pirates.

However, because of offen-
sive lapses in the second half,
which have hurt the Cats all
year, the Pirates gained con-
trol to win decisively. For the
game, Gerdy led all scores
with 21 points on 8-14 shoot-
ing from the field.

Cattes continue in
Spirited victories

By BRENDA BOYLE
Staff Writer

This past Monday, the
women’s basketball team took
on the UNCC ’49’ers at
UNCC. The Davidson Wild-

cattes emerged victoriously’

led by Beth Tanner’s scoring
punch and a team effort under
the boards.

The Wildcattes roared a-
head within the first nine
minutes by outscoring UNCC
18-0. They cooled off some-
what for the rest of the half,
but at no time relinquished the
lead. Due to the combined ef-
forts of Beth Tanner, Nancy
Matheny, Donna Ferren, Cin-
dy Morrison, Kat Morton and
Sarah Womack, Davidson led
at the half 41-23, having shot
50 percent from the floor and
61 percent from the free throw
line.

The second half was not as
explosive as the first, but
Davidson stayed ahead so that
everyone, even ‘‘the Cheer-
leaders” got in the game. Kat

Morton continued to pull

down the rebounds while Beth

Tanner maintained her consis-
tent scoring pace. The UNCC-
ers were never able to recover
from Davidson's opening scor-
ing burst and succumbed to a

& score of 68-48.

This win brings the Cattes
record to 7-5. The women are
looking forward to this Fri-
day’s contest with traditional
rival Furman. The Davidson/
Furman series has been closely
contested the past two years.
Last year Davidson won by a
single point; the year before
Furman prevailed by the same
margin. Unfortunately, the
game is away, but hopefully
this will not dampen the high
spirits of the women.

After the Furman game,
there are five games remain-
ing, only one of which is at
home against Clemson on Feb-
ruary 9 at 7 pm. The women
will also compete in the State
Tournament from February
23-26 at High Point.

Gerdy’s poise reflects Cat’s strength

However, despite this loss,
Coach Pritchett has had no-
thing but praise for his young
team, and looks for continued
improvement over the next
few weeks.

Said Gerdy, ‘‘All young
teams have problems, but
we're all hustling and working
hard on both ends of the court.
We haven't put it all together,
but everyone on the team has
veen really unselfish and
helped each other.’

Against the Indians of Wil-
liam and Mary, the Cats
finally showed the Johnston
Gym crowd what can happen

when they put it all together.
According to Gerdy, the Cats
moved the ball really well on
offense, which accounted for
their excellent shooting per-
centage.

For the game, Gerdy was
5-11 from the field, but more
importantly, 13-15 from the
line as the Indian press could
only manage to foul the Cats.

Said Pritchett, ‘Our boys
really showed a lot of poise.
William and Mary came out
strong early in the second half,
but we stayed in there and put
it away.”

With the win over William
and Mary and last night’s win
over Citadel, the Cats chances
in the Southern Conference
look much improved. By mov-
ing ahead of The Citadel, they
don’t have to play defending
conference champion VMI,
currently 19-1.

Crucial conference games
still remain, and the Cats
improved play greatly increa-
ses the odds for further wins
and a weaker foe in the first
round of the tournament.
