Living together.

Could freshmen men and women
live in dorms co-ed by hall?
Some student leaders bring issue
back to the forefront.

By Jay Jennings
& Robert Ramsay
The SGA will face yet an-
other controversy when two reso-
lutions for co-ed housing are pre-
sented in this week’s meeting.

- Last year, the SGA voted in
favor of aco-ed housing proposal;
however, former Dean of Stu-
dents Will Terry did not approve
the proposal. Senior Class Presi-
dent B.J. Rudell plans to revive
the issue.

The Resolutions
One resolution would advo-
cate co-ed housing by hall for
freshmen. However, every fresh-
man would have the option to live
in a single-sex dorm. Residence
Life would satisfy these requests
first. The second resolution would
support one co-ed hall for upper-
classmen with two bathrooms.
Rudell hopes to pass the reso-
lutions this week, then ‘submit
‘them to Dean of ;
Shandley and perhaps | e trust-
ees. Rudell has consulted Rich-
ard Terry, some students, and the
Alumnicommittee and senses that
there is a desire for these types of
resolutions. Rudell hopes this
will improve relations between
the sexes, giving students another
opportunity to get to know mem-

Tom.

bers of the opposite sex.
The Dilemma

But is that opportunity a good
enough motivation? Davidson’s
residential structure is as much a
part of the school’s personality as
the Honor Code or late nights atthe
Outpost. What would be.the con-
sequences of changing this, and
would those consequences be
worth the effort?

Most arguments concerning
upperclass housing are strongly in
support of co-ed dorms. Students
who have lived in Irwin, Akers,
and Knox, attest to the high degree
of unity and entertainment derived
from life down the hill. Likewise,
seniors who live in the apartments
generally enjoy the sense of com-
munity that develops.

This attitude is shared by stu-
dents at. other schools as well.
Maggie Cole, a sophomore at the
University of Georgia, says that a
co-ed dorm by. hall would
messier, but I would not have a
problem with it.” And as for a
dorm that was co-ed by room, other
than the fact that she would think
twice about walking down the hall
in a towel, Cole says that “basi-
cally, it wouldn’t bother me at all.”

Senior senator Chad Lloyd
feels very differently about the is-

be “alot...

sue. He believes that “there has to:

be adistinct problem before such a
dramatic change is made.” He
thinks that students are mature
enough not to have the school force

- contact with the opposite sex.

” Rosie Molinary, a hall coun-
selor on 4th Rich, says that when

the girls on her hall were pre-

sented with the idea of co-ed
dorms for freshmen, they yelled
in unison, “No!”

The Humanities program will
show improvement and expansion
next year due to $275,000 given to
honor a distinguished professor.

The grant, made by the Na-
tional Endowment forthe Humani-
ties, will enable one professor to
take leave from his or her depart-
ment and focus entirely on hu-
manities for two years. The pro-
fessor will return to teach both
sections of humanities each se:
mester, while developing a theme
for lectures and preparing profes-
sorial workshops.

Brian Shaw, current director
of the Humanities program, says
that “the theme will not only give
students a new look at the pro-
gram, but will also prompt the fac-
ulty to think about humanities in
new ways.”

and the director of the Humanities
program which outlines their ideas
for thematically shaping the pro-

BACKED UP IN TRAFFIC

Traffic on I-77 has created problems for Davidson drivers. The construction on I-77
Davidson and Moorseville often has traffic backed up nearly five miles south of exit 30.

Transcript changes
considered to avoid
grade inflation

By Susan Warren

Grade inflation is a growing
concern on college campuses in
the United States.

Colleges. that once gave C’s
and F’s now do not go below a B.
Stanford and Harvard may be dif-
ficult schools to get into, but 90%
of the grades given are A’s and
B’s, according to an article by Jack-
son Toby in the Wall Street Jour-
nal on September 8, 1994.

According to The Campus
Chronicle, Davidson’s Efficiency
Task Force is considering adopt-
ing a transcript system similar to
Dartmouth’ s in order to avoid grade
inflation, A Dartmouth transcript
shows the grade the student re-
ceived in the course, the median
grade of the class, and the number

of students in the class. This sys-
tem allows the student and others
to see how the student did com-
pared to the rest of the class.
With a transcript like
Dartmouth’s, grades would take
on new meaning. If youhave anA
in a class that has an A average,
then the grade would not be quite
as impressive. On the contrary, if
you have a 3.4 and the average is a
2.6, your grade will only look bet-
ter, since the lower average im-
plies that the course is difficult .
Dr. Peter Hess, an Economics |
professor and head of the Effi-
ciency Task Force, speaks highly
of the Dartmouth system, saying
the Dartmouth transcripts provide
“graduate schools and employers
with a lot more information.”
