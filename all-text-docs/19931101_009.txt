It was only a joke, not a
negative joke.

I was dismayed to read David
Kaylor’s letter in last week’s
Davidsonian regarding the cover
art for the new Telephone Directo-
ries, and at first I was not sure how
to respond. Since then I have also
heard scattered reports that others
around campus are either upset or
confused by the image or have
labeled it “sexist” and “insulting.”
Therefore, I feel compelled to ex-
plain the cover artwork and our
reasons for producing it.

First, let me say that I wish I
could take credit for the cover con-
cept, but, alas, I can’t. That credit
rightly goes to Mike Van Hecke in
our office, whose idea was to pay
tribute to 20 years of coeducation
at Davidson and to the opening of
the new Visual Arts Center by do-
ing a cover illustration in the style
of Roy Lichtenstein, a major fig-
ure in the Pop Art style of the
sixties and early seventies. Mike is
a fan of Pop Art in general and
Lichtenstein in particular.

Although I am hardly an art

historian, I came of age in the late
sixties and I think I know enough
to say that Pop Art was a deliberate
parody of popular imagery that

. used comic book images to deal

with serious subjects. One effect
was to jar you out of looking at
images passively and to make you
rethink what those images really
say. What better time to rethink
our images of women than at the
occasion of the 20th anniversary
of coeducation at Davidson? And
what a nice coincidence that Pop
Art was in vogue precisely when
Davidson was struggling with the
issue of admitting women. Seren-
dipitous, I thought.

So, Mike proposed it (includ-
ing the punchline about “Sam”), I
liked it and gave it the green light.
We hired a friend to do the illustra-
tion, Mr. Errol “Gib” Gibson, a
retired graphic designer and col-
lege art teacher who lives in Cor-
nelius and frequently does
freelance work for us. Iam pleased
for the opportunity to give Gib

public credit for his fine work. —
“Sam” in the cartoon balloon
is a reference to former Davidson
President Sam Spencer, who was
instrumental in bringing coeduca-
tion to Davidson, He knew nothing
about the cover before we pub-
lished the directory, but was flat-
tered by the reference to him and
now has a framed copy of the cover
hanging on his wall at home.
Insum, what was our intent in
publishing this image? It’s a joke,
avisual pun, delivered with tongue

planted firmly in cheek and a .

friendly wink of the eye (assuming

that is not considered a sexist ges- «

ture).
Contextual Interpretation

Having said that, I must admit
that it is also more than a joke.
There is something much more
serious at stake here — images are
important and it does make a dif-
ference how we portray ourselves.
And I am interested in the particu-
lar issue of how women are por-
trayed in our society. But it is im-
portant to look at images with a
little more care and reflection and
not stop with initial knee-jerk re-
actions.

It seems to me that in viewing
images, we interpret them in light
of context, or rather in light of

many overlapping contexts. At the

‘most basic level of context, we

placed the illustration alongside
the logo for the 20th anniversary of
coeducation. What we meant by
this simple juxtaposition was to
say that this cover is a tribute to
coeducation at Davidson.

But this cover is contextually
more complex than that. The illus-
tration is done in the Pop Art style.

How many people would know
that? I have no idea how visually

‘literate this campus is. Would one

out of ten people recognize the
allusion? Five out of ten? Nine out
of ten? I still don’t know. So we
decided to include credit lines on
the inside front cover explaining
the tribute to Roy Lichtenstein.

Chip away what bothers you.

Over fall break I had an in-
sightful conversation with a good
friend. Sidney lives on Long Boat

Key, asecluded key near Sarasota _

in central Florida. He is-a very
down-to-earth man, a man who
speaks his mind with authority--
and sometimes a little obnoxious-
ness. It was in his usual manner
that he answered my questions
about his trade, sculpting.

1 asked him to tell me how to
sculpt, and he replied, “Sure, kid,
you just take a rock, and bang the
hell out of it with a chisel.” Typi-
cal Sidney answer. Then, with
what I can only call sagacity, he
said, “Really, you look at the rock,
and then you chip away what both-
ers you.”

Without realizing it, Sid had
said something very heavy. We’re
given this big rock, called life.
And once we realize the possibil-
ity in our hands, we chip away.

Hopefully, this is not a ran-
dom, haphazard act, but one un-

dertaken with the most meticulous
and careful action. Most of us,
however, aren’t too careful with
this rock. The chisel does not chip
away what bothers us, but often it

"Sure, kid, you just
take a rock, and
bang the hell out of
it with a chisel."

mars that very idea we are trying to
attain, the sculpture we are trying
to create.

Parents and professors help to
guide our strokes, but sometimes

their advice goes unheeded, or,

worse, their words set the chisel
again at the wrong angle. Talking
further, Sidney said that his inspi-
ration can come: from anywhere,
whether it be a poem, an idea, or
even a comment or conversation

he overheard. Once realized,
though, he focuses totally on that
inspiration, working unceasingly
until that idea has been brought
from within the rock by his hands.
It is this same kind of focus that
makes for a good life.

Sticking to what you know is
right comes only with powerful
concentration, and, of course, the
knowledge that something is right.
A sculptor doesn’t just begin on a
whim. There is a definite goal, a
premeditated something that he is
trying to capture. But that some-
thing is already within the rock.
The artist simply brings it out.
Where your beliefs come from is
notsoimportant as your adherence
to them.

If a poem strikes a chord in
you, makes visible a truth to you,
then you are aware of that some-
thing within you that you need to
bring out. You have been given a
direction. Keeping that direction
is the difficult part.

Later that evening, Sidney con-
fided to my family and me that he
too was still laboring over his “life
sculpture,” so to speak. He just
celebrated his eighty-second birth-

day. Keep chipping: ~~~ ~-~~ ~~

Why am |

senior? —

a

Why am I a’senior when last
week I was a freshman? I don't
mean that literally, but many times
I feel that time has moved so
quickly that Icould not possibly be
in my fourth year at Davidson.

As a senior, I am forced to
view life differently than I did when
Iwasa freshman. Inmany aspects,
Lactually enjoy my life better as a
senior. At this point in my college
career, I know what I need to do to
survive academically at Davidson,
and find pleasure in the close friend-
ships I have developed over the
past four years.

You may ask why I am sud-
denly becoming reminiscent about
college life. There actually is a
justification for this article: at
Homecoming last weekend, Ispoke
with many old friends who are
now in the “real world.” Last year
many of these alumni were danc-
ing on tables at parties, making
road trips and hanging out with
their best friends, but this year they
must play the role of mature adults.
ADULTS?!?!?!?. They don’t
LOOK like adults!!! I don’t look
like an adult!! I don’t feel like an
adult. As a child I believed that
adults were old people with grey
hair who worried about rheuma-
tism and dentures. Though I am
already considered by the govern-
menttobea legal adult, until gradu-
ation I won’t have to actually play
this role. (Thank goodness I still
have a few more years before I
have to worry about receiving Se-
nior Citizen discounts).

Though I may sound a bit
worried about aging, I know I will
survive, I am not claiming that I

world, but my biggest fear about .
life after graduation is facing the
uncertainty.

The economy is atsucha state
that even as graduates from a pres-
tigious college, we have no solid
guarantees about our future. Ispoke
with intelligent alumni students last
weekend who were quite success-
ful at Davidson but are now wait-
ing tables or working at stores sim-
ply because they cannot find a job
with a good salary. At Davidson,
our biggest concerns seem to be
going to classes, writing papers,
studying fortests, calling Domino’s
before they close at midnight, and
getting a beer at Patterson court
before the police shut down the
parties. Our life at Davidson is
pretty easy: we don’t even have to

h our own clothes!!! Next year
may bea shock for many seniors:
paying bills, cooking, doing laun-
dry, cleaning, and working (thatis,
if we even find jobs).

The general consensus from
the alumni was that I should enjoy
my time here, because the reality
after college is not so bright. What
other time in our life will we be
surrounded by our closest friends
and have the freedom to do exactly
as we wish? Savor your walks
through the campus. Breathe the
cool crisp air and admire the golden
red leaves that have begun to fall.
Simply enjoy the time when ev-
erything IS secure. For most ofus,
when we leave Davidson, we are
leaving security for the unknown.
What frightens me is that I still
FEEL like a young college stu-
dent, not an adult.
