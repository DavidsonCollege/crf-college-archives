S

despotic or anti-democratic concept,
This is the concept that the political
power or sovereignty should be con-
centrated into the hands of a few.
To my way of thinking. this is an
unrealistic concept of proper govern-
ment because it rests on a false
promise. That promise is the as-
sumption of the infallibility of a
small elite both in intellect and in
the dispensing of justice. A second
jallacy is the rejection of the truisiy
that | power_ corrupss. “Absolute
power leads to absolute corruption.”
There can be no sucly thing as a
benevolet deposism and there has
never been. However, it is conceded
that there may have been a few
benevolent despots. L know of no
instance where there have been two
in a row.

In years gone by, and in some of
them not so long gone byt would
have been appropriate to discuss
other and formerly dynamic con-
cepts and forces. It is of interest
to see what these discarded factors
are as it will serve to point up these
that have been discussed. :

First, let us mention but not dis-
cuss the historic, forces that have
operated to check or limit interna-
tional power. ‘These have been:
talance of power (possible only in
a multi-polar world): International
morality and world public opinian;
and international law,

Other putiticat concepts that have
enjoyed recognition as dynamiddyge:

-acifismy (Oxford movement ofthe
1920's); Isolationism (in United
States and Russia); Disarmament
(world-wide during 1920's in) par-
ticular); World Government. “

‘Khe last of these deserves discus-
sion as it cannot be said that it does
not have a force of a sort today. It
is most frequently proposed by the
groups known as World Federalists
and.it represents, in my opinion, an
idealistic and unrealistic approach to
the problem of world peace. Let me
approach my discussion of it in a
somewhat round-about fashion.

A democratic political unit (gov-
ernment) can exist only so long as
the people or political forces therein
are closely enough aligned that they
can resolve their differences by .com-
promises voluntarily: effected. Vet
those differences be far enough
apart and civil war inevitably re-
sults. (Phis happened to. ys once
in 1860). The great stability of the
United States Government has. been
due to’ the fact that the great ma-
jority.of us-are not too far apart
in our thinking and never have been
except once.
