If the cast of “The Matchmaker” seemed intoxicated
tonight it was with excitement and not from the cham-
pagne and red wine called for’ by the script.

Strawberry punch masquer-
aded as wine and ginger ale bub-
bled like champagne in the
Vagabonds’ production of Thor-
nton Wilder’s four-act comedy
in Chambers auditorium last
night and tonight.

The Slater Service supplied
the soup, salad, chicken, and
“pheasant” in Act If of the
play. When four characters
seemed to be eating pheasant
and two were downing chicken
between their lines, it was ac-
tually chicken for all six. An-
other bit of theatrical trickery
involved substituting mashed
bananas for the squash men-
tioned in the script.

The rest of the properties

was asked.

“Because,” Stowell chuckled,
“it isn’t every day that some-
body stumbles into a rat trap.”

The Drifters, who will be

During the day-long series of
meetings, several issues are
likely to be discussed. THE
DAVIDSONIAN has learned that
a new dean of students has al-
ready been proposed by the
executive committee, and his
name awaits approval only by
the trustees.

SHUE’S PROPOSAL

As reported in last week's

Kuykendall Notes
Sew Greek Errors

Greek Week 1961 was con-
ducted in a generally satisfac-
|}tory manner, according to John
| Kuykendall, liason between the
| faculty and fraternities. There
was only one major infraction
of the rules which required the
attention of the executive com-
mittee.

Kuykendall said that several
minor technical violations were
brought to the attention of his
office, but only one was deem-
ed necessary to take before the
college executive committee. He
said that in most cases there
| was a genuine willingness to
poomety with the regulations and
‘work for the betterment of the
system.

Kuykendall said that he was
“impressed with the overall
excellence” of the Greek
Week programs in general,

| and the decision by the judg-

| ing committee for the best
| pledge class was not an easy

emphasized “The
fraternities and their leaders
are to be commended, because
it was only through the cooper-
ation of the fraternities as
groups that the program was
successful.”

He added that he was “es-
pecially appreciative of the pro-
gram chairmen and fraternity
presidents keeping in close

pledge class.

The fraternity’s program in-
cluded a twofold pledge project
centered around the North Car-
olina Orthopedic Hospital. One
phase of the project was the
construction of badly-needed
cabinets and shelves, and the
repairing of some hospital fur-
niture.

The other part of the project
is a continual program of visits
by the pledge class to entertain
the children and young people
of the hospital. These _ visits
will be made __ periodically
throughout the rest of the year.

RED CHINESE SKIT

The skit which won first
place for the Betas in Skit
Night competition was a “stab”
at Davidson and its policies. The
college was represented as a
commune in Communist China
and the production was staged
with elaborate props and cos-
tumes.

Beta Theta Pi also won an
honorable mention in the Home-
coming decoration contest.
Their display was based on the
name of the Richmond team,
the Spiders. A football player
was depicted as spraying a
huge spider on a web attach-
ed to a goal post.

PIKA’S SECOND

The second place winners in
the Greek Week trophy compe-
tition were the pledges of Pi
Kappa Alpha. Their Homecom-
ing display won first place, and
their project was the painting
of Miss Louise Sloane’s home in
Davidson.

Sigma Phi Epsilon took third
place in the Greek Week judg-
ing. The Sig Ep pledges had

tion,” Dean Bailey said. “We |

“Anytime we feel it is neces-|

Bailey explained.

mind the student body of the
administration’s position, par-
ticularly in light of student body

stitution.

The Election Board will begin
functioning immediately. Its
first task is to supervise the
election of the editor of The

take place during next Mon-
day’s chapel period.

The board met Thursday af-
ternoon, but was unable to
choose its chairman because a
quorum was not present. In
accordance with the prese’it
constitution, the Elect’ons
Board is composed of four In-
dependents and one represen-
tative from each social fra-
ternity. All of these men are
seniors.

Members of the board are:

Another lengthy debate en-
sued over the question of
whether to include the Honor
Court trial procedure in the
constitution. A proposal to do
so was voted down. However, a
motion to place the trial proce-
dure of the Honor Court in the
by-laws was passed.

it was pointed out during
the meeting that much of the
present constitution is being
placed in the by-laws instead
of in the main body of the
proposed constitution. This in-
cludes such things as the new
Freshman Court of Control,
the Elections Board, and the
oaths taken by officers.

The advantage in this is that
changes to this can then be
made in these areas by the Stud-
ent Council itself without hav.
ing to go through the formal-
ity of presenting the change
to the student body.
