C.H.U.C.K. speaker urges anti-hazing stance

By STEPHEN CEFALU

Eileen Stevens delivered alec-
ture entitled “C.H.U.C.K. - A
Mother’s Story” to a crowded stu-
dent assembly this past Wednes-
day evening in Love Auditorium.

The acronym stands for Commit-
tee to Halt Useless College Kill-
ings. .
Stevens established th

sponse to the tragic death of her
son, for whom the organization is
named. He was a victim in a haz-

ing. incident at Alfred University’s
Klan Alpine fraternity in 1978. The
C.H.U.C.K. organization works to
bring about an awareness of haz-
ing, and to prompt legislative ac-
tion to deter hazing abuses.

The organization’s primary
concern is ensuring the safety of
students. As part of its mission, the
C.H.U.C.K organization docu-
ments the many deaths and injuries
resulting from hazing incidents that
would not otherwise be made pub-
lic.

In her address, Stevens em-
phasized that C.H.U.C.K. is not
anti-fraternity but anti-hazing in its
focus. “Hazing has no place at any

institution in any organization, she.

said. “It compromises the dignity
of human beings and defeats the
fundamental principles upon which
the notion of brotherhood and sis-
terhood were founded.”

Stevens described hazing as
wasteful and preventable. She cited
alcohol, peer pressure, and the en-
forcement of sworn secrecy as chief

catalysts behind abusive hazing
practices.

Addressing her words specifi-
cally to the newest members of
Patterson Court organizations,
Stevens said, “Be visible in the
most positive way possible. Bond
and unify by performing commu-
nity service together, and show
people the true meaning of broth-
erhood and sisterhood.”

Stevens’ presentation was “ex-
tremely important,” said Patterson
Court Council President John
Cowan.* “The talk was valuable
because it gave a firsthand account
of the real consequences of hazing
and peer pressure which is exactly
what the new member orientation
program is designed to do,” he
said.

Assistant Director of Resi-
dence Life Beth Searcy said
Stevens was invited because ‘“‘we
most want that pledging be a posi-
tive building experience, one that
empowers rather than degrades the
individual.”

Stevens addressed this idea of
empowerment when she said, “We
need leaders, people who are ac-
countable, who have the courage
to speak out, who know that their
voice can make a difference.”

Sponsors of the C.H.U.C.K.
Organization program were very
pleased by the student turnout.
However, they say that they must
still remain concerned about the
program’s actual application within
the realm of Patterson Court fra-
ternities and eating houses.

Resident Advisor Paul Dryden
expresses concerns. “The program
was provocative, but my concern

‘is that the message may not carry

over well in the heat of pledging
activities.” Dryden says. "People
may distance themselves emotion-
ally from what they heard.”

Stevens’ presentation was one
in aseries of events in the Patterson
Court Office’s new member orien-
tation program.

It will be followed by others
throughout the year.

ments Buford lists the creation of
the Town Liasion committee, his
handling of the [VCF controversy,
and his support of the Rides Pro-
gram.

He admits that he pushed his
own agenda.

“J just worry that more things
didn’t get done in the Senate and it
might be because we pushed for
our own goals too hard.”

Buford says that the biggest
problem he sees with the SGA is
the top-heavy direction that it has
been headed in the last few years.

“We had people that are ca-

pable but its got to be a group
effort. Some people don’t contrib-
ute their share.”

Still, Buford attributes much
of his success to the capabilities
and aid of the senators.

“Obviously, students have a
lot of ability to do things. And the
SGA has the ability to do a lot,” he
says.

On a more personal note,
Buford cites the energy he brought
to the job and the fundamental
confidence about the importance
of the SGA in making Davidson
better.

He had “an ultimate enthusi-
asm and belief that the SGA is a
credible institution that demands

the respect of the faculty and ad-
ministration,” he says.

Buford also tried to establish a
moderate position which, he says,
contributed to his success.

Rather than taking an aggres-
sively oppositional stance toward

. the administration, he opted for a

more balanced approach.

By refusing to compromise,
“nothing will get.done,” he says.
“There is nothing wrong with com-
promise.”

“T believe whole-heartedly in
being fair to the point that it is
stressful. You have to be able to
listen to both sides of the debate.
You have to respect due process,
peoples' rights, and listen to them,”

he says. :

As Buford sees it, the SGA is
a service organization.

"The SGA is a service organi-
zation to students. But we must
also seem like a service organiza-
tion to the institution. The SGA
has to say to the faculty and admin-
istration, “We work with you for

the students’,” he says.
Buford tried to establish mo-

mentum by being knowledgeable
about the issues and proposals he
supported and doing a thorough
job.

“If you are going to go before
the Board of Trustees or the ad-
ministration, you have to have done
your homework. That is how you

build credibility and get things
done.”

So what were his faults? “I
talk too much,” he laughs.

Clair Freeman has also been,
according to others, very success-
ful as Vice President.

"She has been successful be-
cause she is good at dealing with
people individually and listening,”
says Burnett.

“She is different from War-
ren, but they work well together.
Clair is a lot more understated than
Warren is. A lot of times she will
do things that are more behind the
scenes. She is involved in the
smaller tasks that are important
but don’t get as much attention.”

science majors must take one semi-
nar in political science.

Still, Kazee cautions, “Most
students aren’t taking [seminars]
for [the major]. ... It may be that we
have a generation of student who
are increasingly aware of the politi-

cal activity going on around them.”

One way to account for the
demand in courses might be a
simple matter of logistics, since
there may be more students on cam-
pus than there were in the fall.
According, to Carolyn Ortmayer,
who coordinates study abroad, the
1996-97 academic year follows a
recent trend. “Until three years
ago, there were more students off-
campus in the Spring than in the
fall,” she says. “Now it’s flip-
flopped.”

Mrs, Ortmayer adds that stu-
dents can be off-campus for a num-
ber of different reasons, but that
most students away from Davidson
are participating in study abroad
programs. “A lot of factors enter

However the demand can be
explained, department chairs and
the Registrar’s Office must accom-
modate it. For the long term, Kazee
offers a few possible solutions.
“One way of dealing with it is to
have more people teaching,” he
says. An option he dismisses as

unrealistic.

Another solution would be to
offer more seminars. But the prob-
lem with that option, Kazee says,
is that for every additional seminar
offered, fewer regular classes can
be scheduled. “We’re concerned
because we don’t want to dilute the
experience for everyone.”
