This year as fast
seems to be shaping up
as a very tight race for
the Inter f raternity
Sports Trophy which
has been held for the
past four years by the
Kappa Sigs. Last year it
went right down to the
wire before the outcome
was certain and again
this year it looks even
closer as the interfrat
season comes to a close.

Different from last
year when there really
were but three teams
that were close, there are
five that could conceivably take the trophy to their halls this
year. None of the front runners have run away with the victories
or the copping of many individual events. It has been a season
therefore of many close events and many heated and competitive
games and matches.

By DICK LILES

LEADERS DIVIDE MAJOR VICTORIES

The five leaders have pretty well split up the major
sports with the Kappa Alphas taking football, the Sigma
Chis winning the swim meet and handball and a second in
bashetball, the Phi Gams annexing the volleyball crown
and gaining a second in the wrestling tourney and the track

meet, while the Phi Delts really have cached with their cap-
turing ping pong, wrestling and the trach meet with a second
in volleyvall,

The Kappa Sigs meanwhile won the basketball crown and
have really amassed the points by coming in second in three
events. These are football, swimming, and handball. Last year
the ‘‘boy of the red” won the cup nearly in the same manner by
slipping in numerous seconds and thirds, while the Phi Delts
and Sigma Chis were fighting it out over the firsts.

FIGHT TO FINISH

No one will be able to predict how the thing will come
out with tennis, softball, and varsity participation still to be
decided, but one fraternity or the other will have to take one
or two of the remaining or some strong seconds to be assured
of the Big Brass.

This is bound to be tough with the competition such
as it is. It is just like the “big leagues’ for the cellar-dwellers
are always on the lookout to knock off the big boys at
any chance they might get. For example, one team that
hasn't been too impressive in the entire sports agenda this
year has come up with a softball squad that is the terror of
the league at this very moment. The SPE’s have already
bumped off the Phi Delts and Phi Gams, two comparative-
ly strong competitors for the softball crown as well-as being
hot in the race for the cup.

TENNIS MAY BE DOWNFALL

Also on the courts, the front-runners may have a little
trouble. The Betas seem to have the strongest pair of netemen
in the league with Ed Coleman and ‘“Half-man” Walker, and
they also are actually out of the running for the trophy, but
will be pretty tough customers for the boys who are trying for
those ever-valuable points toward the big goal.

And then the question comes up about varsity participa-
tion and that again might be somewhat of a question although
it is cut and dried and only needs counting and calculating to
determine the outcome here. That process by the way is done
by a complicated method that is designed to be as fair as it can
be and is calculated on the basis of the number of men in a fra-
ternity that participate in varsity athletics divided by the mem-
bership of the group.

As far as a prediction is concerned, it looks like the race
actually will boil down to a Kappa Sig-Phi Delt-Phi Gam
push with the KA’s and Sigma Chis falling behind on
these last three caces. At any rate, the last day of school and
maybe later will come before the winner will be known.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

CLEM

Wildcat Diamonds F ace Carolina Here

Poole Hopes For Initial
Mastery Over Heels At Home P

By DICK ROPER
North Carolina's Tar Heels visit the local diamond tomor-
row afternoon to take on a tired and victory-starved Wildcat

nine.

Freshman hurler John “Ish” Ben-
nett will be Coach Dave Poole’s
choice to start on the hill against
a Tar Heel club which has already
edged out the Cats once this sea-
son. The UNC team won 4-3, at
Chapel Hill April 15.

Still smarting from a 12-1 licking
from Asheboro’s McCrary Eagles
here Thursday, the Cats will take
the field decided underdogs against
Coach Bunn Hearn’s Chapel Hill
team.

Esrors—12 of them—were the
order of the day against the semi-
pro Eagles, who garnered a total of
14 hits off three Cat pitchers.

The Thursday performance was in
direct contrast to the Cats’
trouncing of Furman the day pe-
fore. Behind the five-hit hurling of
Ish Bennett, Poole’s club held their
error total down to four while they
touched three Furman hurlers for
nine bingles.

Against Carolina today the Cats
will have a chance of winning, but

only if they can manage to hold
together for nine innings. Going
into the eighth against McCrary
the score was 5-1. Two innings and
eight misplays later the game had
turned into a complete rout.

To date the Wildcats have won
three games while dropping twelve
for a .200 percentage.

Fred Stowe, hard-hitting Cat left
fielder, has been slipping for the

past several games but still owns a].

404 average, with 21 hits in 52 trips
at bat. A good performance in the
final two games of the current sea-
son could well bring the Belmont,
N. C., boy All-Conference honors.

After tomorrow's contest with
North Carolina, the Cats will have

only one game remaining on their | ;

schedule this year. They meet NC
State at Raleigh Monday after-
noon. The Wolfpack won handily
over the Cats in their first meeting
here in April.

Softball Livel

Front-running SPE's Are
Whipped ‘and Forced To Tie

By THEO FEILD

With tennis and softball in the
spotlight, plenty of action is taking
place in the interfraternity sports
competition. Both sports have im-
portant games scheduled for the
coming week with the big question
being whether the SPE’s can con-
tinue their dominance over the
other fraternities in the softball
race.

Only one week remains for the
other clubs to lower the boom on
the victorious SPE’s who have ex-
tended their winning streak to eight
games in a row, although they
dropped one on Thursday to the
up and coming Kappa Sigs.

Tied for first due to the Thurs-
day loss, are the Phi Gams. This
ball cub has racked up eight wins
against a lone defeat which came
at the hands of the SPE's.

Also very much in the running
for the title are the KA’s and Kap-
pa Sigs, both of whom have suf-
fered only «wo defeats.

Other fraternities with a .500 or
Detter percentage in the softball
standings are the Sigma Chis, Phi
Delts and Pi Kapps. Any one of
these teams could play the part of.
the dark horse and slip through
for the softball crown.

In some of this week's action, the
Phi Gams knocked out the Pikas
to further strengthen their position.
The Betas captured their second
win of the campaign by downing
the Campus Club, while the Sigma
Chis defeated the SAE’s.

The pressure will be on next
week when some of the big games
are played. The Sigma Chis will
try their hand at stopping the SPE’s
and the Kappa Sigs will seek to
gain second place by beating the
Phi Gams.

Tennis Reports

The fraternity racqueteers have
gotten off to a slow start with the} 3
Betas and the Phi Gaw5 taking
over as the early leaders. The
Betas have registered three wins
against no defeats, while the Phi
Gams have two wins and no losses,

Other téams whieh appear to
have strong teams this year are
Phi Delits, ‘Pikas and Kappa Sigs;
all three of which have been handed
a single loss.

In this week's action, the Phi
Delts have won over the Kappa
Sigs, putting an end to their five-
game winning streak. The Pikas
won their fourth match of the year
by downing the Sigma Chis, and

E

the Kappa Sigs beat the SPE’s.

A definite leader will be singled
out by the end of next week when
the Betas and Phi Gams clash.

Play has been hampered by the
inconsistency of the weather which
has caused several matches, to be
postponed or cancelled.

FRED STOWE...

»
By BOB OWENS

Perhaps Coach Dave Poole does
not have the most outstanding base-
ball team in the Southern Confer-
ence this season, but he has cer-
tainly got one of its most out-
standing players—leftfielder Freddy
Stowe, °

Stowe has shown his sharp
batting eye in far outdistancing
his teammates in hits, runs
scored, runs batted in, and is
leading the Wildcat batters
with a sparkling 404 average.
He roams the pastures of left-
field as if he were at home, and
his strong right arm is very
valuable to the Cats.

Extra-Curricula Hitter

Stowe, a sophomore who hails
from Belmont, N.C., has made it a
habit of banging out hits, and play-
ing good left field. He played four
years of baseball for Belmont High
School and played. in the N.C. vs.
S.C. All-Star game in Charlotte in
1950. Never one to remain idle dur-

Hahvahd, No Less!

Wildcat of the Week .

ing the’ summer months, Stowe
played for the Belmont semi-pro
team in ‘49 and ‘S51. In the summer
of 1950 he played for the Cramer:
ton semi-pro team and led the
league in batting with a fine. 386
average.

A stern believer in practice
and the fundamentals of base-
ball, Stowe plans to stick with
the game. At the close of this
semester's work Stowe plans
to leave for Nova Scotia with
other Southern Conference
stars where he will play base-
ball for the Truno semi-pro
team during: the summer
months. .

Continued Success

lf the sharp-cyed youngster can
continue to wield the stick as he
has done in the past, he'll go a Jong
way in making Poole’s team a win-
ning outfit as well as maintaining
a batting average that may break all
previous records here at Presby-
terian Hollow, either one of which
would make any Davidsonian proud.

Ivy Leaguers Are
Hosts to Netmen

By MOODY SMITH

With their season’s record now
standing at cight wins against only
two defeats, the Davidson College
netsmen depart for the far nérth
tomorrow on a one week trip dur-
ing which they will run into two
of the toughest tennis powers in
the East—Yale and Princeton.

Besides these two giants of the
collegiate courts, the Cats will also
take on Harvard, Wesleyan, and
William and Mary to round out a
week ‘that should prove whether
this is a great team or only a good
team.

Yesterday at Durham the Wild-
cats suffered their second defeat of
the season, bowing to a very power-
ful Duke aggregation, 7 to 2, David-
son taking the number one singles
with Lacy Keesler defeating Norm
Schellenger in three sets, and
the number six singles with Joe
Dudley defeating Buzz Cordoza in
three sets also.

Individual match scores were as
follows:

Singles—Lacy Keesler (DA) beat
Norm Schellenger 1-6, 6-4, 6-4; Kes
Deimling (DU) beat Johnny Brem-
er 8-6, 6-2; Dave Schimmel (DU)
beat Allen Strand 6-4, 6-3; Buzzy
Hettleman (DU) beat Dewey Kees-

ler 6-1, 6-1; Ralph Paris (DU) beat
Corky Clark 3-6, 8-6, 6-3; Joe
Dudley (DA) beat Buzz Cardozo
1-6, 8-6, 6-1.

Doubles—Deimling and Hal Lip-
ton beat Strand and D. Keesler,
6-4, 6-3; Schellenger and Schim-
mel beat L. Keesler and Bremer
3-6, 6-4, 6-1; Paris and Hettleman
beat Dudley and Joe Snead, 9-7,
6-1,

After returning within the safe
confines of the Mason-Dixon line,
the Cats will have only one match
to look forward to. That is the one
with North Carolina. Scheduled for
last Saturday afternoon this game
was rained out. If present plans ma-
terialize it will be played May 14,
the day before the Southern Con-
ference tournament, which is to be
held again this year on the focal
courts.

The Wildcat cinder squad will return to the familiar cinders
of Richardson Field tomorrow to play host to a power-packed
Tiger squad from Clemson. The Clemson team promises to be
one of the stronger groups which the Cats will face during the
season. The Tigers have beaten South Carolina and Presbyterian
and showed up well in the Milligan Relays, while bowing to the

University of Georgia.

Hot Linksters
Shoot For Fourth

e
The Davidson golf team will be

: 1 looking for its. third consecutive

win on Puesday afternoon in Char-
lotte when the linksters match shots
with the clubswingers from the Uni-
versity of South Carolina. The
Wildcats scored a 17%-9% win
over Clemson and a 14-13 win over
N. C. State last week. If the links
team comes through with a win
against South Carolina, it will
give them a 4-4 record in conference
play for the season and 5-7 over-
all record.

Coach Elgin White said that
he had not yet computed the
scoring averages for the team,
but he believes that Graeme
Keith has the best average. In
conference play Davidson has
scored 914% points against the
opponents 97%. This is not too
bad taking into consideration
a 25-2 loss to a great U.N.C.
team. In several matches Da-
vidson has averaged 75 strokes
or over, which is pretty good
golf in anybody’s league.

Coach White stated that he hopes
the team will make its best show-
ing in the Southern Conference
tournament, which will be held in
Winston-Salem on May 16 and 17.

Wade, Johnson
Win HB Toumey
As Keith Golfs

Three local Davidsonians gained
fame for themselves and their
school this week in the outside
world by performing extraordinary
feats of athletic ability.

Two of the boys teamed up
to take the Charlotte Amateur
Handball Tournament that is
held annually at the YMCA.
They are Ham Wade and
Corky Johnson, two Charlotte
boys who are affiliated with
Kappa Sigma fraternity on the
campus.

Ham and Corky gained fame by
downing the best (or next best)
that Chartotte could offer in the
realm of handball prowess by
scores of 21-18 and 21-1 which was
really a walkaway.

Hoth boys have been active in
sports here on the campus with
Ham playing first-team football for
two straight years, and leading his
fraternity on the intramural field
to many a victory. Corky was a
mainstay on the freshman tennis
team last. year and has been out
for that sport again this year, but
has been unable to break into the
top six or eight, which explains his
extra-curricula handball skill.

Both Wade and Johnson led
the Kappa Sigs to a second-
place in the regular interfrat
tourney held on the campus
this year.

The Cat thinclads last weekend
came through with an impressive
69 to 51% to 42% win over the
Citadel and South Carolina re-
spectively in a triangular meet held
at the Citadel track in Charleston.
The. Red and Black clad tracksters

‘took 6 firsts of the 15 possible, and

took 26 places in all for their 69
total. The Wildcats who took first
spots were: Bill Shipley with a
53.5 time in the 440; Bill White
with a 16.5 in the high hurdles;
Bob Henry with a 2:06 in the 880;
Tom Stockton with a 10:36 in the
2 mile; Buddy McKay with a 14.3
in the low hurdles; and the mile
relay team composed of J. V.
Howell, Bob Henry, Bill Russell,
and Bill Shipley with a 3:35.5 mark.
After last wéek’s meet the
first slot in total points for the
season was taken over by Jim
Fickeisen with a 35 1-3 total.
Though taking no firsts the ver-
satile “Fick” took seconds in
both the high hurdles and the
low hurdles, and fourths in both
the pole vault and the javelin.
Close on Jim’s heels in the
scoring race is big Bill Mc-
Neely with 35 points followed
closely by Tom Stockton with
a grand total of 33. Next in
line are Bill Shipley with
28 3-4, Bob Henry with 26 3-4,
Buddy McKay with 25, and
Bill White with 24.

In a practice meet held last Wed-
nesday against the Lenoir Rhyne
trackmen, the Wildcats smothered .
their guests with a smashing 110-16
victory. The men from Hickory
took only 10 places, 8 of which
were fourths, They repeated only
one first place which came in the
broad jump. Taking the first slots
for the cats were: McNeely (shot):
Turk (high jump); Dick Stockton
(mile); Shipley (440); Mitchener
(100); White, B. (high hurdles);
Russell (880); McNeely (discus);
Mitchener. (220); Mckay (low
hurdles;) Poston (pole vault);
Plummer (6 laps race); and
Fickeisen (javelin).

The Wildcats will be out to
make Clemson their fourth
straight victim as they now
hold an impressive 3-1 record.
This is the last home meet of
the current season.
