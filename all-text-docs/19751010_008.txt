Booters falter to 0-5

Campbell capitalizes
on four Wildcat errors

The Davidson College soc-
cer team lowered its record to
0-5 Tuesday afternoon with a
4-0 loss to Campbell College.

Coach Chip Stone was dis-
mayed with the outcome.
“The game films show that
although we dominated the
action for 85 percent of the
game, we were outplayed,”
said Stone.

The aggressiveness of the
Campbell team intimidated
the players and inhibited their
play.

One Davidson player com-
mented that ‘‘no one was
willing to hit back.’’

Capitalizing on the first of
four Wildcat mistakes, Cam-
bell scored in the first minute
of play.

Attempting to get the ball
back for Goalie Bob Perz to
clear, defenseman Gary
Danciger kicked too softly. .

Two Davidson defensemen
collided while trying to get to
the ball. Perz was left in a

one-on-one situation resulting
in a quick goal. "

Score number two occured
as Perz came out of the goal
after the ball.

A Campbell forward slipped
behind him, took the pass, and
sent the ball into the nets.

Goals three and four oc-
curred in much the same
manner.

“We gave them all four
goals,’’ said Stone. ‘‘They had
no real scoring opportunities.’

Campbell managed only 9
shots on goal. Davidson shot
23 times.

Stone commented that
“This has been our problem all
year. We just have not been
able to score.”’

Davidson suffered their
fourth shut-out in a _ row.
Stone said that ‘‘we should
have been shutting our op-
ponents out and scoring two or
three goals as well.”’

The Cats take on ‘South
Carolina Saturday at 10:30
A.M. and travel to Duke on
Tuesday.

Ruggers bewilder

Face Duke next

With blazing outside speed
and outstanding team hustle,
the Davidson Rugby Football
Club outplayed. Wofford RFC
for a 17-6 victory, their first of
the season.

Former’ Southern Confer-
ence 440-yard dash champion
Mark Connors, along with
Wilborn Swaim, gave -the
Wildcat ruggers acceleration
at the wing positions, which
Wofford simply ‘could not

‘match. They were responsible

for tries of over 40 yards each.

The Davidson defense also
excelled, led by John Lovett
and Bucky Banks in the

scrum, both newcomers in the

record

backfield. Reverend Hamilton
was the nucleus for the de-
fense.

Davidson scored first in the
game, as Swaim booted a
25-yard field goal on a free
kick attempt.

Then Davidson’s_ scrum,
with Dan Bogus and Pete
Johnson providing most of the
leg power, pushed the ball to
within five yards of the Wof-
ford goal line before Steve
Piper took it in.

At the end of the first half
Davidson led 7-0.

Second half action was just
as exciting, with Davidson
again scoring first. Connors
took a pitch on the sideline
and raced to the Wofford goal
untouched. Versatile Swaim
made the extra point attempt
good, moving the Wildcats
ahead by 13-0.

But Wofford made a strong
comeback for a try, which
narrowed Davidson’s lead to
13-7.

Undaunted by this uprising,
Swaim flashed through Wof-
ford’s baffled defense for ano-

@ ther try, bringing his point

total for the afternoon to nine.

The rugby club will meet the
Duke Blue Devils at Durham
next week.

Harriers gain six wins, up overall mark to 8-4

Davidson’s cross country
team raised its record to 8-4
for the season by defeating six
of seven teams in a meet held
at St. Andrews College last
Saturday.

Junior co-captain Coty
Pinckney finished first for
Davidson and fifth overall,
covering the five mile course in
25:41.

His time was the best ever

for a Davidson runner over
that distance, as he improved
on his 26:11 run earlier this
year.
“Pinckney’s time on that
course last year was 26:41,
and the best time before that
was Ricky Bell’s 26:47,’” noted
head coach Sterling Martin.
Senior Fred Borch was only
eight seconds behind Pinck-
ney, finishing seventh overall
in 25:49 which was the finest
effort of his career.

‘Fred was just fantastic,”
commented Martin. ‘‘He
looked like he was going to
catch Pinckney at the end.”

Freshman Doug Horn ran
well despite a hip injury which
limited his practice all week.
His time of 27:07 was good
enough for 12th place.

‘Horn was a little disap-
pointed, but I thought he ran
a respectable race,’’ Martin
explained.

Consistent John Barksdale

once again finished fourth for
Davidson, coming in just one
second behind Horn. Sopho-
more Steve Justus broke into
the top five for the first time
this season, running 27:32 for
the five miles.

Jay Silver and Bill Cole
both had their best times of
the year, running 28:09 and
28:23 respectively.

Scoring the eight team meet
as dual meets gave Davidson
victories over Methodist,

Elon, St. Andrews, and USC-
Spartanburg by perfect scores
of 15-50. The Wildcats also
defeated Lynchburg 16-41 and
Campbell 23-34, while losing
only to Pembroke, 18-43.

“Pembroke has a subsidized
team and they have some
outstanding runners,’’ Martin
noted, while emphasizing that
he was quite pleased with his
team’s performance.

The Wildcats travel to
Greenville, S.C. Saturday .
