Catoing ts the word.

Saturday night saw the best parade in
several years.

In regard to the iootbaii victory Dr.
Fulton says when a thing happens once
it is an accident: twice, a coincident;
and the third time, a habit. “Keep it up.”

The Seniors are weaving and soinning
a lovely web. Senior Speaking is ap-
proaching. Tho many are speaking on
various phases of the war and resulting
aspects, vet there is some reaction against
a war-time subject.

THE JIRE JORRER.

We wish that there was no such term
as jibe. It is vague, indistinct, and a
definite, comprehensive meaning cannot
be obtained. It exists and we put up
with it in some way. The Freshmen
jibe and feel the shock, while the upper-

“classman knows that such phenomenon
exists.

There has grown up ina limited and
interesting, vet menacing manner, a thing
in regard to jibes. The wholesaler has
come into our mumber. A Sophomore
has agreed to allow a Freshman t jibe
him fifteen times for his piece cf pie.
We will waive present judgment or the
one who will sacrifice his honor as well
as the honor of his classmates for a piece
of blackberry pie. or a slice of pound
cake, to satisfy and fill his morhid en-
teron. The student hody does not ap-
prove an action guided by a little stom-
ach, rather than by integrity, honor and
reason.

The Freshmen who have craved such
a privilece had better take warning.
When jibing, you not only make yvour-
self liable to one (who cannot legally
handle you). but to student honor and
traditions. You are weakening the stu-
dent system of ideals and can be handled
bv the Council. Tibing is iihing and the
offense is not neutralized by the gift of
a dessert. Freshmen had better eat their
own pie.

Ihe DAVIDSONIAN, November 14, 1917

FEATURING FRENCH.

Professor Withers, of the French De-
partment, suggested a novel thing which
is appearing in this issue. It is some
live, interesting facts about France writ-
ten in French. ‘He is making an innova-
tion in his Senior French class and our
readers are to share the delightfulness of
the feature “La Belle France.” We are
not attempting to compete with Les An-
nales. There is a wonderful enthusiasm
among Americans today to learn to speak
the French language. Mr. Cole sug-
gested that when we go to France we
will want to have an affair of the heart
with a lovely French girl. This being
quite a contrast for the idle hours when
nat “over the top,” and appealing so our
feeling acquiesced. Surely we must
know how to say at least, ‘‘N’est ce pas
que la lune est helle?”— (Isn't the moon
beautiful ?)

We thank Professor Withers for the
suggestion and for the aid in the com-
pilation of the composition. To work

‘lout this will be interesting as well as

timely and helpful.

A little folder—“The Y. M. C. A.
and the Soldiers’—in which our profes-
sor of English, Dr. M. G. Fulton, had
a great share in editing, is just from the
press. It is a unique exposition of what
the Army “Y” is doing and it contains
strong appeals for the raising of $500,-

000 apportioned to the Carolinas. The
colaborer with Dr. Fulton in getting
this material before the public is Mr.
Joe L. Baker.

Our classmates go—we should give.
“Let's do a super-bit—now !”

Doubtless there is not a college in this
state so fortunate as Davidson in that
it gets wholesome, first-hand informa-
tion from Camp Greene. The talks
such as were heard Sunday evening and
previous ones at the Y. M. C. A. meet-
ings are not to be duplicated. David-
son—the college and town—should ap-
preciate, as both do, the great privilege
of hearing such addresses from men
whose soul is wrapped up in the work.

ACCEPTARLE HOLIDAY GIFTS.

John was in trouble. He could not
make a decision. © A’ friend asked:
“Tohn, what are you going to give your
lady Christmas?” The reply was that
he declared he could not decide—he
didn’t know what. “Well,” said the
friend. ‘Tam in the same fix.”

More than one fellow in college will
thrust his hands thru his hair in anguish
before the year closes. Upon request
Mrs. Fulton has kindly compiled a list
which will aid vou in deciding.

Gifts acceptable to a girl from a boy:

New novels, volumes of poetry, or any
gaod hook.

Cut flowers.

Candy.

A vase for flowers.

Kodak.

Umbrella.

Traveling bag.

Purse,

A picture frame.

A clock.

Sewing basket.

mirror, ete.

Or the same in white celluloid with
monorram.

Knitting outfit.

Writing paper marked with mono-
gram,

Desk set.

Tewel box.

All college emblems and pennants.

Onlv simple pieces of jewelry are con-
sidered good form, unless the girl is more
than a friend.

A year's subscription to a magazine.

The many friends of Miss Kathryn
Worth will be glad to know that last
spring she was the recipient of a prize
awarded at Converse College for the
best poem appearing in their college
magazine. Miss Worth has written
other poems of sterling qualities. A
publishing house of Boston has written
Miss Worth, notifying her that her
poem, “The Deserted Temple,” has been
given special mention in their College
Anthology for the year, at the same time
requesting that she send a collection of
her verses for publication.

From the Charlotte Observer we copy
the poem which has won the award and
the distinction:

The Deserted Temple.

He dwelt in the temple of Reason,
Where only the mind holds sway ;
And adoring the Goddess of Wisdom,

Forgot he was made of clay.

He learned at her feet all the wonders
Of infinite time and space;

And drunk with the wisdom of ages,
Saw only her shining face.

But alone at her golden altar
Alight with his candles of love.

He heard a soft echo of laughter,
Thrilling low thru the arches above.

Then wonder of wonders—the hermit
Sprang up from the cold stone floor,
And answering the call of the Woman,

Past out thru the temple door.

Ah mourn—for the temple deserted.
Stands silent with unlit depths,

And an echo of haunting laughter
And the ghosts of its keeper’s steps.

For some time there has been an in-
creasing demand for a college song that
was sprightly and full of pep and spirit.
The demand scems to have been met by
one who wishes his name withheld for
the present. This song by a student
seems to be just the thing we need for
a good-snappy song to back up our team.
It is eulogistic in that it praises both
Coach Fetzer—who is a mighty force be-
hind our team—and the wonderful team
which now has the habit of victory. The
tune being the Bonnie Blue Flag, makes
it snappy and can be sung with a zest.

We print it with the trust that it
will meet the approbation of the entire
student body and that it will take a lead-
ing place with our other songs of ath-
letics:

(To tune of “The Bonnie Blue Flag.’’)

We have as good an ‘leven as anywhere
is found,

Trained by Coach Bill Fetzer. the best
from far around:

And when they're on their metal—no
better near or far—

Are found than the Davidson men who

hear no single scar.
Chorus:
D.C., D.C. They're D. C. men, they

are.
Hurrah for the Davidson men who bear
no single scar.

They play like men with vigor and jump
into the game,

Working with their captain to win a
wreath of fame;

And when the game is over and victory
is sure,

We'll sing of the Davidson men, whom
nothing does allure.

As grave and reverent Seniors, and Ju-
niors on the Hill,

Soph-mores, too. in all they
Freshmen with their frill,

We'll all unite our voices to spread out
far and near,

The praise for the Davidson men. whe
