THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

PAGE TWO

FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 1962

(All Unsigned Editorials by the Editor)

A Joint Behest

The poll sponsored jointly by the
Student Council and THE DAVIDSON-
IAN has shed new light on the integra-
tion issue at Davidson. It is now possi-
ble for the trustees.to know exactly
how not only the faculty but also the
students feel about the problem.

It is regrettable that all of the
members of the student body were
not interested enough to express their
opinion. We feel, however, that this
vote is an accurate reflection of stud-
ent sentiment. The turn-out was about
the same as that for most major cam-
pus elections if not more. As is always
the case, we must simply assume that
the ratio of opinion among the apathe-
tic is the same as the ratio of the votes
of the interested.

It is indicative that student inter-
est in the poll was so low. A once-
heated topic now seems to have cooled
off. Perhaps the successive integration
of school after school and college after
college in the South has made the in-
tegration of Davidson seem inevitable
and has made argument over the issue
seem purely theoretical. Both the in-
tegrationist and segregationist forces
seem to be waiting, watching to see
what the trustees’ action will be.

In spite of the draw-backs, how-
ever, the results of this poll were un-
deniable. The omission of the “unde-

cided” category from the ballots forc-
ed an even more clear-cut delineation
between the ayes and nays. There
were not five possibilities of choice;
there were not even three. Perhaps
this limitation of choice reflects the
feeling of inevitability on the issue, as
well. Students were asked to either
give the go-ahead signal to integra-
tion at Davidson or to vote against it.
The majority favored integration.

If the die-hards retained their
opinion, we are not surprised. Much of
their fire, however, is gone and much
of their wind has been taken by the
simple “yes” of the majority.

Two students expressed concern
in the poll that if integration comes to
Davidson, that it should be carefully
considered and planned. Certainly no
one on either side of the issue can
wish for.anything but the most careful
and understanding execution of the
integration of the college. If the
trustees take positive action, we are
sure that it will be only with such
care and understanding, however.

The trustees now have a clear

behest from both the faculty and stud- .

ent body for Christian leadership in
the South. We look to them hopefully
for their assent.

Book Committee Finally Scores

After a long series of delays and
setbacks, the -Book-of-the-Year com-
mittee was finally able to come up
with a 1962 selection this week. It has
been hampered by many problems.
Two authors were almost in the bag,
then had to cancel out. But Chairman
Lowry Reid has gone ahead and picked
a book which ought to appeal to a
large part of the student body.

Dean John C. Bennett of Union
Seminary in New York has written
several books of note in the field of
Christianity and politics. He is an out-
standing liberal scholar who perhaps
deserves a wider reputation outside
the religious community. His books
have never been best-sellers, but have
received acclaim among those who
notice works in this field.

The YMCA will bring Dr. Bennett
here to help offset the strong conser-
vative trend of speakers that has per-
vaded campus this year. It has chang-
ed the proposed format for its series
on Communism, too. Instead of con-
tinuing discussion on this segment of
the Liberal-Conservative struggle, it
will open discussion on such contro-
versies as medical care for the aged.
By extending its scope. the Y has
made the program more informative.

Reid and his committee have a
lot left to get ready for Bennett’s ap-
pearance. But we're glad to see them
opening the other side of a hot con-
troversy which in affecting the whole
nation has not passed Davidson, by. 5

Another Winning Team

Last week, Coach Lefty Driesell,
riding a record-breaking win streak,
admonished the student body to con-

tinue supporting the basketball team,

and also those other things, like de
bating: He couldn’t have been more
right.

This year has seen the debate
team set some modern records of its
own, too, after springing back from a
long period of non-existence. A good
example of the continued dedication
of those men and the sacrifices they
have made to build up a highly re-
spectable program is the upcoming
tournament at Florida State Univer-
sity next week end.

Not only are the four top mem-
bers of the team giving up the dance
weekend, they spent almost all of
the midterm break revising their argu-
ments and getting back in shape after
the usual Christmas season lull in
debate activity.

Most of the credit deserves to go
to an energetic group of freshmen and

sophomores and debate coaches Dr.
Joe Drake and Mrs. Grace Lilly who

pulled the forensic program out of.

limbo last year. Their efforts were
rewarded by a commendable record
then. This fall, the nucleus of only
seven or eight has expanded to 40 or
50 and several full teams to rotate on
a more extensive competitive sched-
ule.

__ Their achievements are rapidly
filling the trophy case and restoring
area respect for the Davidson debate
program. We note that they have four
more meets remaining on their sched-
ule this spring. We hope the student
body will heed Lefty’s request.

And just think about next sea-
son’s prospects. That bumper crop of
freshmen and sophomores will all be
back and the present top two teams
will return intact.

Best of luck to both these record-
breaking teams—basketball and de-
bating—in keeping up the fine record.
They both merit all our support.

Let The Good Times Roll

__ Huey “Piano” Smith is languish-
ing in a southern jail without bond.
He can’t make it to Midwinters. Shir-
ley and Lee wanted to come—that is
they wanted to come for a while.

Then it was the Olympics. They
were looking forward to a complete
weekend of rock 'n roll. But they too
had a change of mind; it was some-
thing about not enough appearances.

Undaunted, the IFC turned to

other groups, just as loud and just as
similar, to please the Davidson tastes.
The Crests would do fine—for a while.
Now it seems they won't be with us
either. The Pinetoppers are coming,
among others.

The next cancellation we expect
to hear about this ill-fated weekend
is word from the girls that they can’t
make it. Or for Dr. Woods to go one
step further and declare a flu
epidemic.

Rusk’s Visit Presents
A Two Way Challenge

BY R. W. RIEKE
Visiting Associete Professor
of History
The appearance of Secretary
of State Dean Rusk on the Dav-
idson campus on Feb. 21 for the
Reynolds Lecture Series raises
a question of more than
fleeting interest. Why does this
public official, who perhaps
next to the President holds the
most important single position
of responsibility in the free
world, choose to spend several
hours in the environment of a
small college town, here to de-
liver an address and. to converse
with groups of students, faculty,
members of the administration,

and interested citizens?

We at Davidson flatter our-
selves without justification if
we believe that Rusk is con-
ferring upon us some special
favor in being our guest. We
stoop to the point of ridicule
if we assume that “he owes it
to us” as an alumnus.

We should perhaps’ be
astounded to learn that in the
Secretary’s mind it is very like
ly we who are conferring the
favor and that the responsibility
of owing is ours. It does make
a difference to a statesman
where he delivers himself of
formal pronouncements.

Is it not significant that two

of the decisive utterances in the
Western world following World
Wear II were made before col-
lege audiences? I refer to Win-
ston Churchill's “iron curtain”
speech and Secretary George C.
Marshall’s commencement ad-
dress. The academic audience of-

fers the highest kind of chal- .

lenge to a democratic official, if
for no other reason than the fact
that it is not a special interest
group which can be humored
with platitudes or captivated
with generalities. Small talk
is out of keeping with the at-
mosphere. of sober, inquiring,

reflecting minds.

t¢ may well be that Rusk
has chosen us, not we him,
precisely because we, as Ser:
ious listeners, offer him a
more suitable opportunity to
express his real thoughts than
some other group of hearers.

The Secretarys formal re-
marks at Davidson, however,
may be of lesser importance to
him than the informal contact
with Davidsonians. From the
very first week in office Rusk
has made it clear that he
eschews the sensational state-
ment, the dazzling action. “For-
eign policy," he has said, “is not
the spectacular episode of to
day's headline. . . . The future
of the world will turn not so

much upon a succession of crises
as upon our effectiveness in
dealing with the mass and com-
plexity of our day to day work—
the work which anticipates dif-
ficulties before they become un-
manageable.”

His well known inclination
to favor the ordinary channels
of diplomacy rather than the
road of personal diplomacy at
the summit is in keeping with
this statement.

It follows from this that Rusk
may find it as profitable to learn
first hand the hopes and con-
cerns of his fellow citizens as to
evaluate the pressing request of
some foreign statesman. How
else can the chosen leaders of a
democratic community keep in
touch with the pulse beat of
those they serve other than
through the sort of personal con-
tact afforded by the Davidson
visit?

“There can be little doubt that
our democracy works best. when
its leaders are candid,” said
Secretary Rusk at his first news
conference. He might have add-
ed: “and when those who are
led are equally candid.” Our
distinguished guest owes us
nothing as an alumnus. We -at
Davidson, as responsible citi-
zens, owe him everything.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Simpson Scores ‘First’

With ‘Last Film‘ Scheduled

.
Simpson
Dear Editor:

With all due respect to Mr.
Hagen, we do not intend to show
the films he listed in the Re-
ligious Film Festival. Such films
as “‘King of Kings” and “Ben
Hur” are but inferior remakes
of older films.

We will show only one film

in conjunction with the R. F.

F. | am pleased to report that
the Film Committee is bar-

gaining for exclusive world
rights to Dino de Laurentiis’
“The Bible.”

This 25 million-dollar epic will
run for 10 hours. Originally
scheduled to be shown in three
three-hour and twenty minute
segments, we offer you the com-
plete film beginning at 1:00 p.m.
on Good Friday.

There will be an intermission
between the Old and New Testa-
ments. Communion will be serv-
ed during intermission. The film
will be over at 12:00 p.m. There
will be no admission charge, but
collection plates will be passed.
Pews and an altar will be in-
Stalled in the Morrison Room in
anticipation of the resulting re-
ligious fervor.

The Glory of Ged will be
brought to you in Cinema-

scope and Technicolor. We
hope to have stereophonic
sound installed by that time
so that you may hear the voice
of God in all its true-fidelity
magnificence.

We hope that the students will
remain after the film for the all-
night discussion of the film and
its social implications.

“The Bible” will be the last
film ever shown at Davidson and
throughout the world as well.
It will run forever. The College
Church and all classes will move
their quarters to the Morrison
Room to study the film for the
next 2000 years.

Cunningham

Dear Editor:

In connection with our recent
trip to the meeting of the World
Council of Churches in New
Delhi, Indis, Mrs. Cunningham
and I had the opportunity of
stopping over several days in
Bangkok, Thailand. While there
we were in the home of the
Reverend Horace Ryburn who
is a Davidson alumnus and a
classmate of President D. Grier
Martin. He was particularly anx-
ious for us to see a recent con-

| KILL MAE IF I'VE LOST MY
. NEW GLASSES!

tribution of the Davidson Col-
lege students to the splendid
hospital which is one phase of
the work of the Presbyterian
Church in that area.

As I recall it, it was several
years ago that Lt. Colonel
Adams, who had been P.M.S. &
T. at Davidson and felt a high
regard for Davidson students,
was on a mission to Bangkok
and was in touch with Dr. Mar-
shall Welles and the work of his
Christian hospital. Colonel
Adams wrote the student body
suggesting that they make their
Christmas gift of that year to
the work of this hospital.

His suggestion was adopted
and a generous gift was sent
to Dr. Welles. He was then in
the process of building and
equipping a large new unit
of the hospital. This equip-
ment was ordered from Lon
don.

It is considered the
most scientific equipment of
this type in the entire country.
The hospital is not the largest
but it is said to be the best
equipped of any hospital in Thai-
Land.

I congratulate the Davidson
students once again for this
magnificient expression of gen-
erosity and concern.

Idea Of Law And Order

BY FRANK STAFFORD
Davidsonian Statf Writer

Rev. David Andrews, recently
arrested for kneeling at the
White House fence, spoke at the
Methodist Student Fellowship
last Friday night on the topic of
passive resistance and civil dis-
obedience.

Andrews, head of the Metho-
dist Student Center in Boone,
N. C., explained that civil dis-
obedience was permissible only
when there was a definite and
clear moral or ethical principle
at stake, and when all legal
means had failed. “I believe in
the fullest use of the law,” said
Andrews.

PREPARED TO GO TO JAIL

He further explained that civil
disobedience was “valid only if
engaged in by people with re-
spect for law and order,” and he
stressed that merely being con-
scientious about a moral issue
was not enough. “There are con-
scientious anarchists,” he assert:
ed, “but I am not one.”

When asked if he was not
undermining the law by engag-
ing in civil disobedience, he ex-
plained that he was not trying
to evade the law or the conse-
quences of breaking it. He said
that he was prepared to go to
jail for breaking a minor ordin-
ance (One of the charges for
kneeling at the White House
fence was obstructing the side
walk.) in order to demonstrate
concern for a higher moral is
sue.

Why did he kneel at the White
House? It was an effort to free
a certain Martin Sobell from
prison. Sobell was sentenced in
connection with the Rosenberg
spy trials; Andrews believes he
did not. have a fair trial.
ANDREWS NOT COMMUNIST

Whether Sobell is innocent -
guilty was not argued Friday
night, and it will not be the is-
sue here. Andrews is a minister,
not 2 lawyer, and he admitted
that he has to depend on what
“eminent lawyers and other in-
formed people” say.

The fact that Sobell has been
aceused of being a Communist
has caused quite a political stir.
Consequently, people favoring

Sobell’s release have often been
accused of being soft on Com.
munism.

This political stir does not
disturb Andrews at all. He said
that he sought presidential
clemency for Sobell “in spite of
my disagreement with his poli.
tics” and “because he is a hu-
man being, an American citizen,
and an object of God's love.” As
for Andrews’ political views, he
stated flatly, “ ... I am not,
never have been, and never wil]
be, a Communist.”

UNIMPOSING MAN

David Andrews, an unimpos-
ing man who looks more like he
should be the corner grocer's
son rather than a preacher, is
neither eloquent nor profound,
and he does not try to be either.

He speaks in simple terms de-
signed to overwhelm nobody and
makes his points without a lot
of high-powered philosophical
justification. He is admittedly
naive in politics and economics.
“T have never gotten around to
studying Marx or Lenin... . or
Adam Smith, for that matter,”
he said.

Andrews’ main virtues seem
to be humility and sincerity.
When asked whether his prime
motive for his “kneel-in” may
not have been to ease his own
conscience rather than to right
a wrong, he readily admitted
the possibility that he may not
know his own motives. “There
ate mixed motives,” he said,
“such as hemism, desire for
public attention, and so on. You
just hope that your motive is
basically sincere."

ATTITUDE COMMENDABLE

Some may disagree with the
particuler stand Andrews is
taking in the Sobell case, and
some may disagree with the way
in which he shows his concern.
However, he will have to be ad-
mired for the fact that he is
taking a stand against what he
believes. to be a miscarriage of
justice, not with any flag-waving
or’with any wild-eyed zeal, but
with the demonstration of a
great deal of humility and a
manifestation of genuine Chris-
tion love.

Such an attitude is commen-
dable.

‘Progress’ Program
Presents Real Hope

BY TONY DIAZ

Just before Adlai Stevenson
left on his journey to South
America he went to a big dinner
in New York. Bob Hope was
there and said: “My friend,
Adlai Stevenson, is about to
leave for South America to visit
our friends and he will be back
the same day.” What is the truth
behind the Yankeephobia feel-
ings attributed to the Latin
Americans? Will the long-range
“Alliance for Progress” policy
be the right course to take?

SOME DOUBT

Some American commentators
seem to doubt it. They warn that
the whole American program of
foreign aid rests on assumptions
of very questionable validity,
including the assumptions that
such aid will make friends for
the U. S., and that it will stimu-
late a healthy economic develop-
ment, bring about a general rise
in living standards and promote
the growth of stable, democratic
societies.

Taking a broad look at Latin
America, we note that almost
every country is under demo-
cratic control and that the stabil-
ity of these regimes is under
severe strain in some of them.
Communism and other extreme
left wing forces have generally
gained in strength and aggres-
siveness in the past year. As I
see it, for the U. S., the prob-
lem is essentially political. This
is certainly true of Cuba, which
is the nub of the problem:

CUBA ENHANCES

The alignment of Cuba with
the Communist movement has
greatly added to the appeal of
Communism, since it can now
take on the disguise of an in-
digenous Latin American revo-
lutionary movement. There is
widespread popular sympathy
for the proclaimed goals of the

Cuban Revolution including
land reform, popular education,
social equality, the removal of
foreign business influence, and
the defiance of the Yankee
colossus.
NO RED MASTER

Castro has managed to con-
vince many Latin Americans
that for Cuba the formation of
ties with Moscow and Peking
has meant, not a change of mas-
ters or the absorption of Cuba
by the Sino-Soviet bloc, but on
the contrary the achievement of
genuine independence. To drive
this point home, his government
recently took part: not only in
the two conferences of Punta del
Este, but also in the conference
of neutralist powers at Belgrade.

What course of action should
the U. S. take? Not unilateral
military action against the Cas-
tro regime. Such action would
now be a blunder of the highest
magnitude. It is not -justified
either by the present threat
from Cuba or by the present
prospects of the Castro regime,
which, I am confident, will eith-
er shed its Communistic affilia-
tions or disappear. There is no
reason to assume that we must
either blast Castro out now or
else tamely submit to the per-
manent presence of a Commu-
nist power on our doorstep.

INTERES? IN “PROGRESS”

A lot of ink has been spilled
over this question since the
fiasco of last April, to confuse
the issue. But to me the choice
before the U. S. is simple: is
the United States going to con-
tinue to conduct its relations
with Latin America on the basis
of the voluntary association Ja-
boriously built up during the
past three generations, or is it
going to exchange this for a
hemispheric regime of force?

In Latm America there is a
unanimous and intense interest
in the “Alliance for Progress”

_ Program. Without exceptions,

governments emphasized the
political importance of making
the Punta del Este meeting a
success. If the program crystal-
lizes there is no question in my
mind that Latin American gov-
ernments are ready to catry
through sustained development
efforts, including the needed
Structural reforms.
