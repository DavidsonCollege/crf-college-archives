Taft: Nixon Style
A Spur To Hope

By BILL LINEAWEAVER
Asst. Managing Editor

Congressman Robert Taft
Jr. presented a broad out-
line of the shape of things
to come under the Nixon
administration in assembly
yesterday.

Professor Jon Fuller of the
Political Science Department
introduced Taft. describing
him as “‘one of the most im.
pressive and dynamic mem
bers of the new Republican
leadership in Congress."

Taft. a deliberate, method
ical speaker, touched brief.
ly on the recent unrest on
many college campuses.
“There is always a risk in
volved in coming to a cam
pus.” he said. ‘“‘You can
either get locked in or Tock-
ed out.” He endorsed Nixon's
“rule of reason” policy on
campus’ disorders. adding
that order must he main
tained internally by the col-
lege.

Moving into the mairi area
of his talk, what he termed
the ‘‘stvle of the Nixon ad
ministration."" Taft generally
sketched the future guide-
lines of American policy in
both domestic and foreign
areas,

“The world scene domin
ales us.” he said. “Under
the new administration there
is new hope in the hearts of
men.”

The new administration, he
said. is in a position to re
establish dialogue in foreign
relations, thereby ending
what he termed ‘'the policy
of reaction where we are
determined by external fac-
tors; we will now be able to
take a more effective role
in foreign affairs."

Taft. also said that he was
in favor of continued develop-
ment and deployment of an
anti-ballistic missile system.
although he said later that
his knowledge in this area
was sketchy.

Taft said that on the do

mestic scene the emphasis
will be on “helping people
to help themselves. Economic
and social problems are in-
terrelated. and I forsee a
multi-faceted attack.”

The only time Taft drew
in his 30-minute
speech came when he men-
tioned that the Nixon admin-
istration is considering abo
lition of the draft in favor
of a volunteer army.

The congressman called for.
confidence and at. least ini-
tial support for the Nixon
administration. “The tone of
the new administration is one

of activism and balance,”’ he °

said. “The. very attitudes
and position of President
Nixon deserve initial endorse-
ment and cooperation.”’

Sees Limited Threat

From Applications Decline

By STEVE WILLIAMS
Stoff Writer

The total number of ap-
plications for admission to
Davidson have been on a
declining trend since 1965
while the number of strong
applications have remained
fairly stable according to H.
Edmunds White, director of
admissions and financial aid.

White also said that ap
lications for admission in
1969 have been running ahead
of the previous year at this
time for the last three or
four months.

Last year's total was the
lowest ever, but the total
number is not important.
White said, since the dif-
ference has been ‘‘almost
totally in weak applications.”

The reduction in weak ap-
plications is due to better
guidance counseling and the

competitive nature of Da~™

vidson, he said.

White gave several other
possible explanations for the
decline, one of which was that
there were not as many stu-
dents ready for college in
the years of the decline be-
cause of fluctuations in the
birth rate.

The relatively high costs of
a private college as com
pdred to state-supported in
stitutions may discourage
some. and Davidson's not
being a co-educational col-
lege may discourage others,
he said.

From 1965 to 1967 applica
tions from students in thé
top 10 percent of their class
in public schools. increased
by 44 while total applications
from public schools dropped
by 150.

This supports the idea of
a decrease in weak applica-
tions, yet in 1968 the public
school figure of applications
from students in the top 10

Davidson’s Short Terms
Prevent Student Exchange

— ®8y TOM SINKS
Staff Writer

Although the student trans-
fer program of the Charlotte
Area Educational Consort-
ium has been in effect since
September, Davidson has not
yet participated in the pro-
gram and prospects appear
dim for any transfers either
to or from Davidson for the

rest of this year.

According to Registrar Jay
Ostwalt, there are three
major problems that make
it difficult for Davidson to
participate in the program.

The difference in tuition be-
tween Davidson and other
participating schools, the
problem of credit and dif-
ferent, standards of admis-

sion betwen the schools need
to be worked out before par-
ticipation by Davidson will
become possible. Another bar-
rier is Davidson's term
length, which is different
from the semester lengths of
the other schols.

Dr: W. Hugh McEniry.
chairman of the Central Com-
mittee of the Consortium.
said that a subcommittee has
been appointed to attempt
to deal with some of the
problems concerning trans.
fer between participating
schools.

Dr. McEniry said that ap-
proximately 15 students are
presently taking a transfer
course at one of the partici-
pating schools. The students
are from Sacred Heart. John
son C. Smith, Belmont Abbey
and Central Piedmont Com.
munity College.

They are taking courses
at UNC-C and Queens. Mc-
Eniry said that sometime in
the future there might be as
many as several hundred stu-
dents participating in the
transfer program.

Another part of the Con-
sortium’s program, the trans-
fer of professors for a term.
might begin next year. Mc-
Eniry said that the Chemis-
try Departments at UNC.-C,
Queens and Belmont Abbey
are exploring this possibility.

The only part of the Con-
sortium'’s program that Da-
vidson will participate in im-
mediately would be a ‘book
pool according to Ostwalt.
This pool would be a simpli-
fied form of interlibrary loan
that would allow schools to
make use of the greater re-
sources of another school.

ed. by 103 from the 1967 fig

White noted. that this is a
bad comparative figure. ‘It
doesn't necessarily imply
that one class is weaker than
another.’’ he said. ‘‘You also
have to take into considera
tion the statistics of the en
rolled class’’ in relation to
the statistics of all appli.
cants for a particular year.

This statistic “is not half
as important as what the
enrolled class does when it
gets here.”’ White explained.
There are 206 students from
the top 10 percent of their
class (of public schools) in
the freshman class this year
and 204 in the sophomore
class.

When asked if he felt that
the requirement of a recom-
mendation from the appli-
cant's minister or the ad.
mission policy in general
discouraged diversified stu
dent applications, White re
plied. “It probably discour
ages some, but when an ap-
plicant writes and says he
can't get that recommenda
tion we allow them to sub.
stitute someone else.

“Many things tend to dis
courage applicants. Requir-
ing three achievement tests
discourages many. ‘The prob

Apathy Fails
To Stop SGA

AN ANALYSIS
By DANNY WHITE
Associate ‘Editor

Much has been written con-
cerning the role of student
government at Davidson but
the basic fact remains that
most students know little and
care less about the activities
of the SGA.

As the SGA begins its sec-
ond year of existence, iust
where does it stand and what
function does it perform for
the students that it repre-
sents?

In the old student council
days student government was
a drab concept implying good
guys who won the honor be-
cause of their popularity.

The last student council
president. Tom Earnhardt,
began the actual change in
the concept of student power
that was climaxed by the
passage of the Code of Re.
sponsibility.

Student government made
its first great strides at Da-
vidson in the initial admini-
stration of Joe Murphy whose

overbearing personality was
the backbone of the SGA.
The results were such
changes ds drinking on cam
pus and open dorms.

Now beginning its second
year, the SGA is undergoing
birth pains. While Murphy
ruled singlehandedly _last
year, Peter Hobbie cannot
and actually should not rule
in the same fashion this year
because of the defiance of
several upstart senators.

And this is the way the
SGA Senate was designed to
operate—it should not be the
one-man organization which
by necessity it was last year.
Currently the Senate oper.
ates on a conimittee basis
and the whole Senate meets
only every three weeks to act
on committee recommenda-
tions.

However. just how well
are students represented by
their government and do
they really care whether they
are or not?

In the idealistic rhetoric of
the SGA Constitution, the SGA

(See BIRTH, Page 6)

is listed as $90,200. The phy
sical education budget is
$79,420, according to the re.
port.

Athletic grants-in-aid are
not based on need, as are all
other scholarships. They are
given solely on the basis of
athletic performance at the
discretion of the coaches.

Much of the cost of main.
taining the subsidzed status
of basketball and football
would exist even if these
sports were not subsidized.

Coaches’ salaries are .in
cluded .in the commission's:
cost as $55.669, and basket
ball as $43.583.

‘he report also does not
include income received from
the Living Endowment. Sev.
cral years ago the college
discontinued the poticy of
accepting gifts spocifically
for the athletic. program, ac.
cording to Business Manager
Robert Currie,

Instead, 34 per cent of con
tributions to the Living En

scholarships.

Last year's Living Endow
ment contributions totaled.
aboet $236,000, of which about
$40,006 went for -athletic
schohirships. Currie said.

The 1964 Treasurer's Re-
port lists $73.444.as the a-
mount of the Living Endow
ment going to athletic grants
in-aid.

Footbal! suffers a net loss
in game costs, according to

mended.

The resolution, introduced
by sophomore senator Cecil
Burney, called for trustee
action at their May 9 meet-
ing. and cited the Blue Sky
report and previous Senate
action as backing for the
action.

Defying a Feb. 19 restrain.
ing order against taking ex-
ecutive action. the Senate
Executive Committee nomi-
nated Andy Goodson for SGA
treasurer and David Sweatt
for the Educational Policy
Committee.

Both were confirmed with
out opposition by the Senate.
but freshman Phil Riner.
who had asked for the origi:
nal restraining order, said he
would ask the Court of Ap-
peals to block the two ap-
pointees from taking office
with a second restraining
order. ,

Indications ;were last night
that the second order would
be granted.

This action would leave the
SGA without a treasurer and
consequently unable to spends
any funds.

Discussion on basketball
seating centered on com-
plaints which have been
raised about the quality of
student seating at these
games, specifically that too
many students are required
to sit behind the goals.

A resolution was finally
passed which suggested that
seats in Section H. a center
section now sold to the gen-
eral public, be for student
use only.

The resolution was a
mended to include permis-
sion for ticket purchase on
presentation of a student's
ID, rather than requirement
that purchase be made in
person.

Bobby Ambrose, Chip Price
and Sweatt were recognized
as an official SGA committee

lieved.

Excluding coaches’ salar-
jes, the football program
costs $185,824. If the amount
received from the Living En
is deducted from that, the
approximate cost of main
Laining subsidized football at
Davidson fs. $103.000.

to basketball and deducting
coaches’ salaries; subsidized

It is aitficult 10 determine

would be eligible for aca-

The Commission question.
ajre notes that utilities, main-
tenance and depreciation are
not. included in the athletic
costs. Currie said that these
expenses are not calculated
for any instructional or ed-
ucational part of the college.
