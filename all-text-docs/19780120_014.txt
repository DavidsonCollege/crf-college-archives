Apps down Cais

Davidson will return to
Charlotte Saturday afternoon
looking for its first victory
against the University of
South Carolina since 1974.
Last year, USC beat the Cats,
69-53, but it was a 5 point
game until last minute free
throws by USC widened the
margin.

About the upcoming game
Coach John Kochan said, “I
expect a real good game
Saturday. We will be motiva-
ted and I know South Carolina
will be motivated. This is a TV
game; this is a rivalry.”

Offensively, Coach Kochan
believes the keys for Davidson
will be more offensive move-
ment and rebounding. He also
expects a slower tempo.

“T look for a control game.
South Carolina will play a
zone. We'll have to attack it.I
hope the guards have a good
shooting game. I hope to
break a little bit at different
times, and we’ve got to re-
bound better than we're re-
bounding.”’

As for the defensive keys
Coach Kochan said, ‘‘We have
to stop the penetration of
Jackie Gilloon and, keep the
ball away from Graziano, es-
pecially on the offensive
boards.”’

Davidson (7-8) will also be
trying to even its record
against USC and rebound
from its disappointing effort
Tuesday night against Appa-
lachian.

Gerdy best
in SC again

Junior guard John Gerdy
was named Southern Confer-
ence Player of the Week for his
outstanding performance last
week. Gerdy had 69 points in
two games (37 against Fur-
man and 32 versus Marshall).

The Wildcats used a trap-
ping defense to slice a 10 point
Appalachian lead early in the
second half to two points,
54-52, with just under seven
minutes to play.

It was at that point that the
Cats fell apart, committing

numerous turnovers and tak-.

ing some bad shots, which
Coach Kochen attributed to
the outstanding man-to-man
defense Appalachian played.
However, Coach Kochan

had accolades for two of his .

players, Pat Hickert and Kev-
in Doherty. “Pat again gave
us a consistent, solid ,perfor-
mance which he’s done since
the break. He’s the most
consistent inside player we
have now.”

Turning to Kevin Doherty
who has played a greater role
in Davidson fortunes of late
including 12 points, 8 re-
bounds and 4 assists in 30
minutes of playing time a-
gainst Appalachian, Coach
Kochan said, ‘Kevin has been
a big help. Kevin’s an athlete.
He’s experienced, smart, and
he’s going to be a factor for us
the rest of the season.”’

Coach Kochen explained the
absence of Davidson’s once
potent fast break in Tuesday
night’s game. ‘“‘Appalachian is
a real quick team, they got
back well on defense.”’

‘‘We wanted to keep the
tempo away from running up
and down the court. We
wanted to keep the score a
little lower. We hoped to get
balanced scoring by going in-
side, which didn’t work out.”’

Coach Kochan explained his
strategy, ‘“We have two great
shooters in John Gerdy and
Chris Dodds, but they can’t be
expected to carry the load all
season.”

“Other teams are going into
odd defenses, like the triangle
and two, against us. We had
hoped to have gotten better
movement on offense

though.”

Swimmers crush Paladins

By SKIP BARKLBY
Staff Writer

The Davidson Wildcat
Swimmers resumed their pre-
Christmas winning ways with
a 63-50 defeat of Furman
University in Greenville, S.C.
this past weekend.

The victory left the tankers
at an impressive 4-0 record.

The team has yet to reach
its potential and will swim
much better as the season pro-
gresses.

The team showed the effects
of an intensive 10-day training
session in Florida over break.
The team members returned
early and left Davidson De-
cember 30 bound for Daytona
Beach.

Chilly 55 degree tempera-

tures greeted the team on their
first day of workouts in an
outdoor ‘‘heated”’ pool.

The schedule called for a
9,000 yard freestyle practice at
8:00 am followed by a 6,000
yard practice at 2:00 PM
which concentrated on the
individual strokes.

After 8% miles of swim-
ming the team did not do too
much in the way of celebrating
the New Year as most team
members were in bed by 9:30.

The benefits from this type
of training program are long
range and the team can expect
improvement in future meets.

The modest performance at
Furman, time-wise, was com-
pensated for by the Wildcats’
superior depth.

However, there were some
clutch races swam by the
team. Co-captain Jonathan
Washburn was a double win-

ner as he captured the 200-yd.
Individual Medley and the
200-yd. breaststroke while
swimming against Furman’s
captain.

Mike Knowles, the other
Co-captain won another tough
race as he outlasted the Fur-
man competitor in the gruel-
ing 1000-yd. freestyle.

Other Wildcat victors in-
.cluded Tom Spangler in the
200-yd. backstroke, Mark
Tommerdahl in the 500-yd.
freestyle, and the 400-yd.
freestyle relay team of Ed
Imbrogno, Steve Yood, Ray
Craven, and Tim Bode.

The swimmers are now
pointing towards this weekend
when they will travel to Vir-
ginia to face Madison and
VMI in a tri-meet on Friday.
Saturday the tankers will be in
Williamsburg, Va. for a meet
with William and Mary.

Gepfert advances to finals

By HARRY GRIFITH
Staff Writer

Davidson freshman Jay
Gepfert teamed with Scott
Morse of New Canaan, Conn.,
to advance to the finals of the
first National Intercollegiate
Platform Tennis Champion-
ships, held December 27-28 in
Princeton, N.J.

Platform tennis is similar to
tennis, but there are some
significant differences. in
platform tennis, the court is
one-third smaller and is sur-
rounded by thick-gauged
chicken wire off which the ball
can be played. Also, the ball is -
made of hard sponge rubber,

the racket is only one and
one-half feet long, and only

Bi,

one serve is allowed.

the finals by virtue of a close
upset victory over the top
seeded team of Bill Hammer
(Scarsdale, N.Y.) and Kent
Pierce (Rye, N.Y.).

After dropping the first set

‘by a 6-2 margin, the winners

came back to take a 7-5, 3-6,
6-3, 6-4 decision.
Gepfert, a member of the

-varsity tennis team, com-

mented, “It was my first big
win in a number of years, and
I hope it will carry over into
tennis.”

However, Gepfert and
Morse dropped the finals by a
4-6, 6-4, 6-1, 6-2 score to Pete
Henderson of Georgetown U-
niversity and Greg Moore of
George Washington Univer-
sity.

“We were a little overconfi-
dent after our big win, and we
never really got untracked,”’
explained Gepfert.

Gepfert’s success in this
tournament is outstanding,
considering the fact that he
had not played platform tennis
in more than a year prior to
the tournament. In fact, his
total lifetime experience in-the
game is very limited.

However, Geptert cited his

‘good’ tennis background as a
- major factor in his success. _

“Tennis and platform tennis

‘are similar enough to where

they are mutually beneficial."
