came to get an education. But what do you
mean by that? Do you mean to make of

Davidson Head Suffering With

A shadow of sorrow and anxiety has hov-

due to the severe illness of Dr. W. J. Mar-

tin, president of the college, who is confined

to his bed in the Charlotte Sanitarium,
gradually recovering from an attack of
bronchial pneumonia. Dr. Martin became

sick at sea, while returning from a tour of
Europe. The ship physician diagnosed Dr.
Martin's illness as typhoid fever, but upon
being carried to the hospital, the symptoms
were found to be those of pneumonia.

Dr. Martin, in cémpany with his wife and
daughter, Miss Eloise Martin, spent practi-
cally the whole of the summer vacation
touring Europe. They visited points of
interest in England, France and Italy, and
were en route to Ameriga when Dr. Martin
first became ill.

His condition grew steadily and
upon his arrival in Charlotte, his physician
immediately had him carried to the Sani-
tarium, where he has been in a dangerous
condition for the past two weeks. The at-
tending doctors were alarmed over his con-
dition for many days and were doubtful
over the possibilities of his recovery. Dur-
ing the past several days, however, Dr. Mar-

responded to treatment very satisfactorily.
His physician believes that the crisis has
been passed, and that Dr. Martin will be:

Wildcats for the Opening Game With Elon

When Coach W. LL. (Monk) Younger runs his scarlet-jerseved squad out on Richardson Field Saturday to
usher in the 1924 North Carolina intercollegiate football season, a Davidson machine of nine letter men and two
fellows “up fro mthe ranks” will line up against the Elon aggregation, Three weeks of hard, heavy and grinding
work, for the 10 days preceding college opening doubly so, skull practices, blackboard talks, position studies, not
to mention the two months of spring practice in Black's cow pasture, all have combined to develop the squad from
a mass of letter men, varsity men, substitutes, and ex-freshmen into a concrete machine of experience, form: and

spirit.

Reception at Gymnasuim

Dr. A. Currie Makes Address in
Place of Dr. Martin, Who is II

On Monday night, September 15, at 8:00

o'clock, all the members of the class-of ‘28, |

togethér with members of the three upper
classes of Davidson, gathered at the gym-
nasium for the annual Freshman reception.

After passing the receiving line the Fresh-
men were greeted at a booth in charge of
two Davidson's beautiful young
where punch was served. After this
lightful drink had been imbibed, another
booth came into where additional
punch, together with ice cream and cake,
was served.

Due to the and illness Dr.
Martin, the address of welcome was deliv-
ered by Dr. A. Currie, who told the mem-
bers of '28 a few of the manners and cus-
toms of Davidson which might be puzzling
to them. He also explained the eccentricities
of the weather at Davidson. This was the

of the Freshman reception committee, ex-
plained that it was thought the affair would
be a greater success without many speeches.
This was heartily agreed to by all.

After Dr. Currie’s address the Y. M. C.
A. showed a moving picture, The Code of
The Sea, which everyone enjoyed. When
the end was reached, all departed, some to
once more take up their task of studying,
others a less strenuous task of talking over
the affair.

Certainly it may be said that this was the
most successful reception held by the “Y,"
and one that served its purpose of welcom-
ing and making the Freshmen feel that they
are a part of Davidson, where they are to
make their home for the next few years.

Three Bratenors Added
To Davidson’s Faculty

Dr. Clark, Prof. Zeliff and Captain
Daugherty to Strengthen
Faculty

Three new men have been added to the
Davidson faculty for the coming year: Dr.
Clark, Asst. Prof. C. C. Zelik, Sergeant J.
L. Kirby, and Capt. R. D. Daugherity.

Doctor Clark, a native of Danville, Va.,
comes to us from Hampden-Sidney College,
where he was the professor of modern lan-
guages from 1911 to 1923. From 1905 to
1911 he was the professor of languages and
mathematics at Cluster Springs Academy.

He was prepared at three colleges, receiving |

the A.B. degree at Hampden-Sidney Col-
lege, A.M. at the University of Virginia,
He is
the author of one book, “La Laiebible.”
