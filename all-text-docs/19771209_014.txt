The Davidson Wildcat bas-
ketball team made a strong
showing against a highly
touted N.C. State team, co-
ming away with a 10 point
loss.

The Wildcat guards Chris
Dodds and John Gerdy sup-
plied most of the fireworks,
scoring 66 of the team’s 96
points. Dodds had 35 and
Gerdy scored 31.

The only other player to
score in double figures was Pat
Hickert, who scored 10 points.
Hickert also hauled -in the
game high 12 rebounds.

State led most of the way
and near the end of the first
half threatened to pull away as
they mounted an 18 point
lead.

But a tight Wildcat defense
and the shooting of Dodds and
Gerdy pulled the Wildcats to
within three with three min-
utes remaining in the half.

Dodds explained the Cats
resurgence, ‘‘We just had to
speed it up out of despera-
tion.”’

State regained its compo-
sure, however, and led by nine
at the half.

The Cats continued playing
a strong game in the second
half and pulled to within two
at one point.

But State, with the good
outside shooting, prevented
Davidson from taking the lead
and opened up a 12 point lead
of their own.

At this point late in the
game the Pack resorted to a
spread offense. Although Da-
vidson applied strong pressure
they were unable to narrow the
margin significantly.

Coach Dave Pritchett was
obviously pleased with the
team’s performance. After the
game Pritchett complimented
his players, ‘‘After the first
ten minutes you beat State.’’

In an interview he added,
‘‘We’re young. I’ve got to be
proud of the way my people
played.”’

Forward Rod Owens was

also pleased with the team’s
showing. ‘‘We played very
strong the last 30 minutes.
This was the first real test
we've had against a top team.
Now we see what we've got to
dow

The players responded well
to the home court enthusiasm.
Hickert remarked, “This week
was the first time since I’ve
been here that I’ve seen the
students really support us.
Believe it or not it really
makes a difference.

“Charlotte Coliseum was
our home court tonight. If the
crowd comes to the game
determined that Davidson is
going to win, it makes it awful
tough on the other team.”’

Gerdy added, ‘‘I hope the
people stay enthusiastic, be-
cause we're going to im-
prove.”

Clubbers close fall season

By KEVIN ROBBINS
Staff Writer

The Fall of 1977 witnessed
the rise of some new sports
and fine performances as well
as many mundane moments as
our Club Sports Autumn wrap
up ties together all those loose
ends and unanswered ques-
tions that have kept you
dangling.

Firstly, the new sport. The
upstart Water Polo Club al-
lowed an opening season loss
to whet. their whistle for some
heroic exploits as they
plunged back into action to
splash to victory in a rematch

Dodds

Freshman guard Chris
Dodds has been selected the
Southern Conference
Player of the Week for his
first four games.

Dodds was averaging 23
points and 12.5 assists
through Satirday night’s
consolation victory over
Colgate in the Charlotte
Invitational Tournament.

Off to a brilliant start in
his varsity career, Dodds
has already set a Davidson
single game assist record
with 17 in the first game of
the season.

strong for the future and may
take on those glutton-for-pun-
ishment Mountaineers in a
winner-take-all (of what?) in
the spring.

Davidson’s finest football
club made it all the way to the
final four in the state playoffs
before bowing to North Caro-
lina 10-8 on their field.

The Cat Clubbers ended the
regular season at 5-3.

While being outnumbered
approximately 3-1 in every
game, they continually

stripped opponents of vir--
tually everything with their
tenacious defense. Way to
grid your teeth and bear down,
guys.

But where have all the
ruggers gone? After some
slight altercations with their
governing body, the ‘‘guts and
girls’”’ group are, uh, planning
an active recruiting drive in
the near future.

Their motto now is ‘‘Give
blood - play rugby or don’t
play rugby and give lots of
blood.”

That’s it for now;
cutting out fast.

Pinckney, Strobel,
Davis grab awards

By JOHN DAVIS
Staff Writer

The Davidson cross-country
team completed its season on
Saturday, November 12, at
the Region III meet in Green-
ville South Carolina. Senior
Coty Pinckney ended his ca-
reer with a superb 54th place
finish and a school record time
fo 30:15 for 6 miles.

At the post-season banquet,
Pinckney was awarded the
Most Valuable Runner plaque
as well as the Fred Borch
Cross Country Award, whith
is presented to the runner who
gets the most out of his
ability.

John Davis received the
Outstanding Freshman Tro-
phy, and George Strobel was
awarded the Highest Mileage

Trophy.

The Wildcats are now trai-
ning in preparation for the
track season, and several run-
ners hope to enter the Char-
lotte Observer Marathon on
December 17.

Prospects for next year’s
team look very bright. Al-
though the team loses Pinck-
ney, Doug Horn will return as
captain after missing the ma-
jority of this season with an
injury.

John Hoots, one of the top
high school runners in North
Carolina, plans to attend Da-
vidson next year and should
help immediately.

With the addition of these
two to his nucleus of rising
sophomores and juniors,
Coach Norm Koller anticipates
a much improved season.
