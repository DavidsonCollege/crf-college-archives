We Couldn't Have Said It Better Ourselves

In response to the charges brought against The Davidsonian
this week by Mr. Jay Ferguson that the staff deserves a “sellout”
because we do not support the means by which a certain group
wishes to promote awareness, the editors have chosen to print in
this space the following passage from Charles Dickens’ The
Mystery of Edwin Drood:

Still his philanthropy was of that gunpowderous sort that the
difference between it and animosity was hard to determine. You
were to abolish military force, but you were first to bring all com-
manding officers who had done their duty to trial by court-

’ marshal forthat offense, and shoot them. You were to abolish war,
but were to make converts by making war upon them, and charge
them with loving war as the apple of theireye. You were to have
no capital punishment, but were first to sweep off the face of the
earth all legislators, jurists, and judges who were of the contrary
opinion. You were to have universal concord, and were to get it
by eliminating all the people who wouldn’t, or conscientiously
couldn’t, be concordant., You were to love your brother as
yourself, but after an indefinite interval of maligning him (very
much as if you hated him) and calling him all manner of names.

Above all things, you were to do nothing in private, or on your
own account. You were to go to the offices of the Haven of Phi-
lanthropy, and put your name down as a Member and Professing
Philanthropist. Then you were to pay your subscription and get
your card of membership and your riband and medal, and were
evermore to live upon a platform, and evermore to say what Mr.
Honeythunder said, and what the Treasurer said, and what the
sub-Treasurer said, and what the Committee said, and what the
sub-Committee said, and what the Secretary said, and what the
Vice-Secretary said. And this was usually to the effect: “That this
assembled Body of Professing Philanthropists views with indig-
nant scorn and contempt, not unmixed with utter detestation and
loathing abhorrence”’--in short, the baseness of all those who do

not belong to it, and pledges itself to make as many obnoxious |

statements as possible about them, without being at all particular
as to facts.

Letters

Giovanni Article Criticized

To the Editor:

I was appalled when I
read the article written by
Tom Koonce about Nikki
Giovanni. You presented
her as though she was any
“old” guest speaker when in
fact she is one of the most
prominent black poets of our
time. Why deprivethe reader
of necessary information
concerning such an impor-
tant speaker?

How do you expect the

To the Editor:

Does Tom Koonceclaim
toknow anything atall about
the English language? One
has to wonder after reading
his article about Nikki Gio-
vanni’s speech in last week’s
Davidsonian Itisan outrage
to see such a highly ac-
claimed poet's address be
deteriorated into such a
poorly written fifth-grade
level, semi-literate, nine
paragraph atrocity. As “The
Princess of Black Poetry,”
Ms Giovanni received no

jewels from Mr Koonce;
instead he treated her more
like a peasant. We are
amazed tosee how onecould
have listened for45 minutes
yet heard as little as he did.
He took her wording totally
out of context. Few or no
quotation marks are used and
where they are, they are
inappropriate. To be a news
editor, one must have some
idea of how to write--an idea
which is not present in this

Phi Delta Theta Apologizes

To the Editor:

Patterson Court parties
are intended to be used as a
means for escaping the rig-
ors of the classroom that we,
as Davidson College stu-
dents, deal with on a daily
basis. The parties should
not infringe on any person’s
rights as a citizen or a stu-
dent, and all houses should
accept their fellow school-
mates with respect and

friendly behavior. Unfortu-
nately, on October 19 an
incident took place at Phi
Delta Theta’s Air Band that
exceeded the boundaries of

Besides the fact that
certain acts in Air Band
exploited the female body
and contained songs with
explicit lyrics (which have
long been a part of the com-.
petition), the act that was

most offensive was per-
formed to a song written by
the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
The act involved a group of
men performing sexual
movements on an infil

female doll while they
danced on stage with socks
covering their genitals, Al-
though their intention was to
mimic the music video that

First East Rebuts

To the Editor:

In response to last
week’s eloquent railing of
our letter about the column,
“Sexuality and Health,” we
would like to clarify our
standing. Our intent was
definitely not to portray a
cavalier attitude about “Love
Presents.” We only hoped
to show that some on cam-
pus are still somewhat con-
cerned with tact, and yes,

even themorals that Mumsey

and Dadda sought to instill.

We are quite sure that
our parents would want us
men to learn from facts that

could save our lives. We |
assumed (incorrectly) that |

most On campus were un-
concerned with the distant
future of male contraception.
An apology is in order. We
were also presumptuous in
assuming that the men and

women of: Davidson ‘knew
of pertinent facts such as the
dangers of recycling con-
doms.

The prospect of infertil-
ity. is sobering. These
women are correct in the
assertion that never experi-
encing the joys of father-
hood would be a “blow to
[our] huge male egos.” We

Peppers Reacts to Editorial

ro the Editor:

I feel in responding to
my and Ms Herzig’s and Ms
Mallory’s letter by saying
that “McCarthyism, we are
pleased to see, still has a
place in the hearts of today’s
young” you have resorted to
ridicule and have success-
fully side-stepped rational
discussion of the issue. I
want to address the moral
and ethical responsibility of

Davidson students not t at-
tack the first amendment.
Should legal limits be
the only limits that we place
on ourselves as moral
agents? If the law says that
we have the right, for ex-
ample, to scrawl a swastika
On a poster outside the reli-
gion department, does that
mean that it is ethical for us
todoso? I guess I just failed
to articulate my hope that

awareness of respect for
others on this campus might
check some of the insensi-
tive posters and actions tak-
ing place as of late. Ido not
want the law to place con-
Straints on our freedom. I
just wish thata fundamental
fellow students would serve
asaself-placed check on this

Foxx Explains SERCH

To the Editor:

1am writing in response
to Phillip Atchison’s opin-
ions article “Something
Offends You? Just Change
It!” Let me say upfront that
my response is written not
out of pride but conviction,
for I feel’ somewhat at fault
for the misunderstandings
which may have arisen from
the article on Students for

the Establishment of Racial
and Cultural Harmony
(SERCH) two weeks ago.
SERCH does notseek to
spread multiculturalism into
the formal structures of
Davidson. The case can be
made for that, but that is not
our case. Fundamentally,

our Case is that even in this :

bastian of diversity, people
still do not understand each

other -- not as groups or
individuals. The purpose of
SERCHis to getpeopletalk-
ing about black and white
issues very bluntly (and to
listen to each other) in a
Constructive setting, We
focus on

Mr. Atchison is correct
when he says that there is a
