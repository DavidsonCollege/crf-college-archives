International conference on Hispanic.
women writers to take place in October

By Kelly M. Dixson

Approximately 160 lecturers
from around the United States and
other countries including Spain,
Australia, Argentina, Mexico,
Puerto Rico, and Chile will arrive
on campus Thursday, October 20
to participate in a conference en-
titled “Modalidades de
Representacién del sujeto Auto/
Bio/Grafico Femenino.” The con-
ference, sponsored by the AT&T
Visiting Scholars Program, marks
the 20th anniversary of the Asso-
ciation of Hispanic Women Writ-
ers and is the first conference on
the hispanic auto/biographical fe-
male subjectto be held in the United
States. Davidson’s own Dr.
Magdalena Maiz-Peiia is the di-
rector of the event, and Dr. Luis
Pefia is the Conference Co-direc-
tor. Many other students and pro-
fessors at Davidson will partici-
pate in various ways.

The themes of the conference
include auto/biographical writing
from_-poetic-self portraits to testi-
monials, including fictional letter-
writing and the postmodern sub-
ject in film and fiction and the
auto/biographical “T’ in diaries and
all other genres. Although related
to Hispanic, Spanish-American,
Luso-Brazilian, Afro-Latin Ameri-
can, and U.S. Latina writers, the

lectures will be interesting to all
because their provacative frame-
works reach beyond any language.
Between Thursday and Saturday
there will be 40 different.sessions,
with each session including pre-
sentations by three or four differ-
ent lecturers. Many of the presen-
tations will be in English, and any-
one in the Davidson community is
encouraged to attend. Highlights
of the program include:
Thursday: a session on creative
writing (invites artists from vari-
ous countries to share their own
autobigraphical works);

Friday: a session on eroticism and
pornography, a roundtable discus-
sion entitled “The Personal and the
Professional: Women in Hispanic
Studies”, asession on literary theo-
retical frames, and a session on the
subversion of the female subject in
film;

Saturday: a session on cultural
autobiography from the margins
and a panel on Yo La Peor De
Todas,-a-video-about-Sor Juana
Ines de la Cruz directed by the
Argentinian filmaker M. L.
Bemberg.

Davidson professors giving ©

presentations include Professor
Luis Pefia, Professor Barbara
Simerka, and Professor Ramén
Figueroa.

The Keynote Address, spon-
sored by the Public Lectures Com-
mittee, will be given Friday night
at 8:30 in Vail Commons and is

munity. The speaker is Sylvia
Molloy, the Albert Schweitzer Pro-
fessor in the Humanities at New

rors: Biography/Autobiography in
Teresa de la Parra.” Molloy is the
author of several books, including
At Face Value: Autobiographical
Writing in SpanishAmerica(1991),
Women’s Writing in Latin America

(1991), and the latest book on Jorge"

Luis Borges entitled Signs of
Borges (1994). Dr. Maiz-Pejia
names Molloy as the leading critic
on Hispanic autobiography as well
as one of the most outstanding
femenist critics. Pefia states, “If I
pick up a book on Latin American
femenist criticism and Sylvia
Molloy is not cited, I know to put
it down.”

The-conference will also in-
clude a book exhibit and the op-
portunity to order books from sev-
eral small independent presses,
including one from New York and
one from Chile. Students who are
interested in volunteering at the
conference should contact Dr.

Group to study art history in England

By Randy Hartwell

When Art History Professor
Larry Ligo says “there are all sorts
of advantages” to participating in
the Spring 1995 Art History Semi-
nar in England, he means it. Like
its sibling programs in France and
Italy, the seminar in England em-
phasizes the need to study works in
their original forms rather than to
analyze discolored slides.

The’ 14 students who partici-
pate will have the opportunity to
study the Gothic cathedral at Can-
terbury, see a Shakespearean play
in Stratford-upon-Avon, and view
works by Monet in Paris.

On the same day classes begin
at Davidson in January, students in
the group will begin work on three

“lengthy” papers covering topics

in each of the three classes Ligo
will teach: one on the Gothic ca-
thedral, one on nineteenth-century

painting, and another on the his-
tory of art in Britain. These papers
will then be used to team-teach the
rest of the group at various sites
during the course of the program.

“When we actually stand
there, you [the student] will tell us
about it,” Ligo says. For instance,
a student might present a paper on
prehistoric England at Stonehenge
or one on early iron development
in Birmingham.

During jaunts from their hotel
in the Bloomsbury district of Lon-
don, the group will embark on
“study tours” of northern and south-
ern England, where they will stay
at country estates now operated as
retreat centers by various church

_organizations.

Three weeks will be spent in
Paris studying paintings at the
museums there as well as the ori-
gins of Gothicism at St. Denis,

Chartres, and Notre Dame.

“All three courses will be as
we travel; 6 we’ll have to be a bit
schizophrenic,” says Ligo. Stu-

‘dents will also have time to com-

plete work on their fourth course,
an’ independent study, which can
be in any approved discipline.
Ligo stresses that students
need not be art history majors to
apply. The Art History Seminar in
England counts fora full semester’ s
credit and costs the same as a se-
mester at Davidson. It is open to
sophomores, juniors, and seniors.
While there is no set application
due date, Ligo says the final deci-
sion will be made soon, so that

_ Students who are not selected but

want to spend the spring abroad
will have time to look into other
programs. Interested students
should contact Dr. Ligo at the Vi-
sual Arts Center.

COSEN students make
presentations

By Courtauld McBryde

Three Davidson women,
Alison Dorbandt, Valerie
Whitlock, and Melissa Remes par-
ticipated in Carolinas-Ohio Sci-
ence Education Network's sum-
mer scholars research program.

Eight colleges from Ohio and
North Carolina, including
Davidson College, make -up the
COSEN network. COSEN pro-
vides women and minorities with
programs in scientific fields.

Three students from each col-
lege or university were involved
with this particular COSEN sum-
mer program. The students
swapped schools with other
COSEN affiliates for ten weeks
last summer.

The participants presented
their COSEN summer research
reports last Tuesday. Their presen-
tations were a warm-up for the
COSEN conference this weekend
at Duke University.

Alison Dorbandt, a senior bi-
ology major, spent her summer at
Duke University's Department of
Cellular Biology. Her research
focused on protein kinesis and
chick embryotic heart cells.

Valerie Whitlock, a senior
chemistry major, conducted her
research at Kenyon College. Me-
lissa Remes researched how tem-
perature and acidity affect feather
digestion in Bacillus licheniforms
under the Department of Zoology
at Ohio Weslyn University. :
