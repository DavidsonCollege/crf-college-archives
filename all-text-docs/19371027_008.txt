Forty-Five Band Leaders Will
Furnish Music at Home-
coming

As a feature of the Home-
coming day celebration, Nov.
6, James Christian Pfohl has
arranged a Bandmasters’ Band
which will play both immed-
iately before the North Caro-
lina game and during the half.

All the bandmasters of North
and South Carolina have been in-
vited to participate, and it is hop-
ed to have between a forty and
forty-five piece band. Each band-
master will wear the uniform of his
own organization.

As drum major, Pfohl was for-
tunate in securing Mr. Archibald
Graham, director of the band at
Berryhill High School, and a form-
er drum major at the University of
Oklahoma.

Members of the band will meet
at 10:30 on the morning of the sixth
to practice for the afternoon per-
formance.

passing and defense work. In the
Centre line, Martin was outstand-
ing. For the Wildcats, Captain
Bailey Williams turned in by far
the best game. His defense work
was superb, and time after time his
booming kicks kept the Kentuck-
ians out of the danger zone. Fred

Dennis also played outstanding
ball for the Wildcats, as did Bill
Davis and Bill Bolin.

Another new rule concerns stu-|
dents repeating courses for a second

time.

“Let’s take a look
at the prices”

said a customer the oth-
er day, “and I'll know
whether or not I’ve been
wasting my time reading

about your styles.” °

He’s right. Price is im-
portant and a man who
is all dressed up with no
place to go isn’t in as bad
a spot as the man who is
all dressed up and has no
money left over to go
with. _

You'll like our fall cloth-
ing prices for they allow
you the quality, the de-
signing and the fabrics
you want without taking
your mind and money
away from the other
things you'd like.
