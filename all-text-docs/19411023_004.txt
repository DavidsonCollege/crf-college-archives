Frosh Talk

The freshmen, despite a particularly objectionable class
on the whole, have a pretty good ball club. Arthur Roach
has looked like a big league performer at tailback, and
there are others.. George Peters, Roach’s sub is probably
the best frosh back not to make the first team in many a
year. And Tommy Peters, Luke Riffe, William’s passing,
have all been first class. Coach Bolin’s boys have proved
the first Kit eleven to be more than eleven for some years.
They’ve still got a pretty large squad and there’re a lot
of boys who may make good Davidson ball players before
they’re through. The Kits meet E. M. I. tomorrow, and
there should ’be little doubt as to the result. Coach Bolin
can probably alternate his first, second, and ‘maybe third
teams at will, and that seems to be what-the spectators at
the frosh games enjoy.

Greek Meets Greek

On Sprunt field afternoon activities are running just about
true to form. = [Ek season lostications gave the edge to
any of several tedms, and so far its still a neck and neck race
Phere’s a disputed game clogging the records and no one seems
to know quite what to do about it... Both the teams, the
SAEs and the the Ks are undefeated, if the game is played
over, and if the score stands aseit is, the Sigmas have the top
of the league standing. As the situation stands now, there’s

still five minutes to go with the SAEs one touchdown ahead.
The WAs have the lead m first downs 4-2, but there is a pos-
sibility that the whole contest may be replayed because of a
questionable and’ incident. The Kappa Sigs have
proved ‘a “Msappointment’ after their 32-0 trouncing of the
Pikas in their tirst game, and the Pi Kaps have failed to come
through for the carly predictions. Beta Theta Pi has been a
surprise package with what is probably her best team in five
years. They've won 3 and the ones which they lost have all
been close. ;

decision

~~ The SAEs have surpassed the rating given by most im-
partial observers, and they can credit their rise mainly to
the punting and passing of Freshman Charlie Wills. With
what are probably two lines as good as any other one in
school they’ve always been considered a good defensive
club, but Wills’ kicking puts them in the territory where
a break often means the game, and at are winning ’em.

On Monday of next

week the K.As meet the Betas while the

Ti Raps and the SPEs lock horns _on_the-other-field;—Euesday
Phi Gams, next day it’s the Betas vs. the SPEs and the Pikas
against the Phi Delts. The KAs play the Fijis on Thursday

and the Pi Naps and SAEs complete the program for that day.
