Patterson Court discusses money

By STEVE PEEPLES
Staff Writer

Approximately 500 students eat
their daily meals in one of the eating
clubs or fraternity houses on Patter-
son Court.

The pay anywhere from $205 to
$230 a term for board alone, and the
price is constantly subject to change,
usually in an upward direction.

There has been some discussion
recently on Patterson Court about
possible economizing measures. One
idea which is being considered is
common buying on a co-op basis. All
houses would but food in large
quantities and-.store it in a common
facility.

Sacrifice autonomy

“T think there’s no question that
this would save money for the
houses,”’ said Jeff Neikirk, President
of the Patterson Court Council (PCC).

“It would work, but I don’t think
anyone would want to sacrifice the
autonomy of their house.”

The idea of a central buying and
distribution center ‘‘has been dis-
cussed many times before,”’ said
College Business Manager Robert A.
Currie.

“I think you'll find, however, that
overhead costs would make the plan
impractical.’’ Currie cited several
plans for such a system proposed in
the past, and pointed out that these
had been abandoned.

He added that Ron Scott, manager
of ARA Slater at Davidson, is willing
to help the houses with purchases
through his contacts, but that the
house mothers generally prefered to
buy on their own.

Central distribution

Mrs. Johnson, house mother at Phi
Delta Theta concurred with Currie
that overhead for a central distri-
bution set-up would be prohibitive.

‘“‘We don’t get special prices on food
though, because we’re just a drop in
the bucket for these big distributing
companies,’’ but that storage,
staffing, and organizational problems
would overcome possible savings of
co-op buying. She added a further
objection.

‘‘You don’t all'want to serve the
same meal on the same days every
week,’’ a situation which could pos-
sibly occur from common dist-
ribution.

Mrs. Johnson pointed out that she
had been at the house for 11 years,

and her experience helped her to get
better deals on many items.

‘Although we generally buy
through Biggers Brothers, I often go
to Cashions or other stores for better
prices.”’

Buxton buys

Another. house mother, Mrs.
Buxton, buys for PAX, Emanon, and
KA. She was in close agreement with
Mrs. Johnson on the central pur-
chasing and distrubuting plan.

“T certainly think it would be the
wrong idea.’’ She also mentioned that
her experience in the business helped
her keep costs down.

‘Scott pointed out some of the
specifics of operating a central facility
for the nine houses on the court.

Two employees

“It would take at least two full time
employees, one for receiving and one
to do the distributing to each house.”’
He said that although the system
would eventually pay for itself by the
savings, at this time it was probably
impractical, due to the problems of
setting up such a facility.

Rusk House had been mentioned as
a possibility, but, according to Scott
“the training table will problably be

there all of this year and possibly next
year too. You've also got to consider

that you’d need a freezer, refrige-
rating and regular storage.

“One way the houses could save is
to buy the same item from the same
people all the time. Even if the
purveyors had to deliver to nine
different houses on one trip it could
save them four or five percent,’’ said
Scott.

Often get burned

‘‘All 3 house mothers are very
talented and capable ladies, and their
houses are lucky,’’ said Scott. He
indicated that students doing the
buying ‘“‘often get burned.”’

‘By the time a house manager has
enough experience it’s time to hand
the job over to someone new,” Scott
said.

As for the future of the court,
Neikirk said that within 10 or 15 years
the eating house idea probably
wouldn’t exist.

Emphasizing that these were ten-
tative, long-range plans, he pointed
out that it would be more economical
for the college to phase out the
individual houses serving meals.

_.. Local crime increases

two weeks ago that the cross-
country locker room was
robbed.

- Martin commented on the
problem of theft from the
locker rooms in Johnston
Gym.

“Sure, there is a person on
the lower-level door and a
person in the basketroom at all
times. But as long as there are
other entrances and exits
available, there is no way to
stop people from stealing.”

Martin said that he felt the
only way. to eliminate the
problem was to eliminate the
entrances and exits used by
the thieves. ‘‘There is no way
we can afford to hire people to
watch each of the doors,’’
Martin said.

“The only way we can afford
to do it is to put fire alarm-
type doors with panic bars on
each of the entrances except
one, and to have somebody
checking I.D.’s at that one
entrance.

The College Union is also
experiencing problems with
theft, according to Assistant
Union Director Russell
Kushigan.

“Myrtle Knox (secretary to
Union Director Smith) lost
$9 out of her wallet. ‘‘Some-
body stole fifty dollars worth
of postage from us. Bob
Meyer, Union Vice-President,
had his desk on'the second
floor of the Union gone
through,”’ said Kushigan.

Police Captain Hughes said
that there has hot been much

of a change in the amount of

money stolen so far this year |

as compared with last year
this same time.
“About the most expensiv
things reported stolen were a
$200 bracelet and a $100
watch. These both were stolen

from student rooms,’’ said

Hughes.

Assistant Dean of Students
Mary Lou Dietler said that a
committee composed of Dean
of Students Will H. Terry,
Director of the Physical Plant
Grover Meetze, a member of
the police force, and herself
will meet soon to set down
some suggested procedures to
follow in the event of an
assault or robbery.

‘“‘We want to make certain

that thé right people are
notified about incidents at the
right time,”’ said Dietler. ‘The
police should always be
notified immediately so that
the attacker can be pursued.”

Dietler, who has_ had
experience counseling rape
and asault victims, said that
the Dean ot Students Office
should also be notified of an
incident at some point.

“Someone should be there
to talk with the person.
Someone who knows what
they are going through, their
doubts and fears, should talk
with the person.

“Even if this does not
happen right at the scene,
someone should check up on
the person later to make sure
everything is all right,” said
Dietler.

Dietler also said that she
thought incidents such as
assaults should be publicized.
“Té can be handled so that the
name of the individual is not
publicized. People need to be
aware that things like this are
happening.”

Dean of Students Will H. |

Terry emphasized many of
Dietler’s statements. ‘‘We
need to give more publicity,
rather than less, when security
breaks down. We need to alert

people to the danger and to

educate them to the danger.”’

Both Terry and Dietler saw :

a need for a central reporting
place on campus for assaults
and thefts. This office would
also keep statistics on assault
and theft. Hall counselors,
dorm managers and all stu-
dents would be kept informed
on trends in these areas.

“If someone says that
permission was received, it is
simply not true. That person
should be asked to leave.
Failing this, security should
be called immediately,’’ he
said.

SGA extends campaign period

By STEVE BELL
Staff Writer

The SGA Senate has exten-
ded the campaigning period
for this winter’s SGA elections
from 7 days to 11 days.

Senator Roger Brown pre-
sented the motion, arguing

that the longer campaign
period would give the candi-
dates greater public exposure.

The vote in favor of the
extension was 18-1, with one
abstention. The vote Tuesday
night was the first time that
the recent revision of the SGA
By-Laws, permitting the sus-
pension of the deadlines, had

been used.

Also in business Tuesday
night, the senate approved
Warren Soule, a freshman, as
Brad Swalwell’s replacement
as Chancellor.

Absent from the meeting
Tuesday night were senators
McMillan, Roylance (3 ab-
sences to date), and Sibley (2).
