Tuition
increase is
less than —
expected

By Ranpy HARTWELL
Staff Writer

Though no one likes to see
college costs rise; next year’s
tuition increase, from $22,534
for the 1994-95 school year to
$23,990 for 1995-96, as Presi-
dent Kuykendall said in his Feb-
ruary 13 letter to Davidson stu-
dents and their parents, “repre-
sents the lowest percentage in-
crease since 1977.” The 6.5%
augmentation is a far cry from
the eight to nine percent rates
many private colleges and uni-
versities charged in the 1980s,
when costs rose and federal
funding dropped.

Vice President for Busi-
ness and Finance Bob Sutton
says the relatively small cost
elevation has “two motiva-
tions.” The first, as he told the
Charlotte Observer ina Febru-
ary 26 front page story on tu-
ition hikes, is to. make every
effort not “‘to price middle-class
families out of a Davidson edu-
cation.” The other is that “tu-
ition ought to bea market driven
figure.” With a national back-
lash against high college costs,

administrators realize. that in |:

order not to alienate their’
middle-class clientele and to
competetively vie for students,
tuition must be kept in check.

Cambridge Associates,
Inc., aconsulting firm that con-
ducts national surveys of insti-
tutions, ranks Davidson far
ahead of its competition. In a
study of 111 private colleges
and universities, Davidson
places 72, meaning 71 other
selective colleges are more ex-
pensive.

Although the percent in-
crease is small, “the issue,” says
Sutton, “is not how much it
increases, but how much is it?”
Sutton says four factors influ-
ence the Board of Trustees’ de-
cisions on college costs.

The first is “a deep interest
that our charges don’tadversely
affect the ability of most Ameri-
cans tocometo Davidson.” The
second factor is “how our
charges stack up with other pri-
vate colleges and universities
across the nation.” The third is
“how we stack up to our re-
gional peers”; and the fourth
concerns a “fairness to existing
students.” :

The Student Health Services
Advisory Committee was formed
by Dr. David Staton, Director of
the Counseling Center and Health
Facility, to evaluate student health
services on campus.

The ad hoc committee was
established after student concerns
were expressed last fall through
the SGA. :

Five members compose the
committee: Lucian Dervan ‘98,
Debbie Liverman ‘96, Assistant
Dean of Students Leslie Marsicano,

Professor of Biology Dr. Donald
Kimmell, and Dr. K.D. Weeks ‘69
from Presbyterian Hospital in
Charlotte. _

Staton Hopes the committee
will help “evaluate the Health Fa-
cility in an impartial and substan-
tive way ... look at and assess our
current health services and make
recommendations to improve or
enhance those services.” The com-
mittee will have the chance to meet
with members of the Student Health
Services staff and to tour the facil-
ity. Weeks will evaluate the Health
Center’s equipment and services.

' Many students have com-

plained that at the Health Center
physicians provide to little of the
actual care students receive. The
health facility currently has a
contract with the Davidson
Clinic to provide physicians’ as-
sistance care from 1:30 to 5:00
p.m. Monday through Friday.
In addition, a physician is on call
after hours and on weekends.

The committee will spend
this spring evaluating the facil-
ity, with the intention of imple-
menting changes next fall. Stu-
dents will eventually be asked
to evaluate their experiences at
the health facility.

New Union Board

By CarRIE BLACKBURN
Special to The Davidsonian

The weekend before Spring
Break, February 24-26, the new
Union Board held aretreat at Black
Mountain to formulate their strat-
egy for the upcoming year.

Union staff members Union
Director William Brown, Assis-
tant Director of Programs Sherry
Malushizky, and Assistant Direc-
tor for Operations Mike Goode
helped lead the board.

Program Advisor Molly
Johnson comments, ‘‘ I thought it
was very productive in teaching
them a little more of what to expect

of what their position will be.
Brown led a session on the history

of the Union, which helped them

see what happened before them
and where they can go. I hope the
retreat will serve as a starting point
that will continue throughout the
year.”

The board worked on getting
to know each other, building group
skills, and brainstorming for up-
coming events. Between planning
sessions, they had plenty of free
time to explore or just to bask in the
sun.

Films Chair Matt Foree com-
ments about the retreat, “I met
people I wouldn’t have met other-
wise. We sat down for a long time
and wrote down plans for the rest
of the semester, which got us in
gear.”

Co-curricular Vice President °

Martin Young also feels the week-

iN SAS Slat

plans and plays

end was successful both as a bond-
ing experience and for setting spe-
cific goals for the Union and indi-
vidual committees. Young says,
“I am excited personally because
there is a-mood on campus that
things are going to change. There
is an excitement in the air, and the
Union plays such a big part of that
and can tap into it.”

Young, together with Union
Board President Morgan Perry and
Social Vice President Katie
Schwab, are dedicated to improv-
ing interaction with other campus
organizations. Meetings have al-
ready been set up between Perry
and the presidents of SGA and

more people together as organiza-

tions work together instead of com-
peting to attract students. Recent
successes with such cross-pro-
gramming include co-sponsorship
of bands on Patterson Court and
coordinating big weekends (Home-
coming, Midwinters, and Spring
Frolics).

The Union wants to work to-
ward increased participation.
Young says, “We provide a lot for
the community that people do not
take advantage of. We need to
work on attendance and public-
ity.”

The new Union Board was
selected after a stiff competition,
which had. officers wousag tire-

Dean of Students Tom
Shandley and Gullan have been
asked to hammer out the details
about student representation on the
other three committees.

Gullan says, “Since we do
not have time for a long and com-
prehensive process of selection for
this first year, we are going to have
an application and interview pro-
cess, which will begin immedi-
ately.” The deadline that has been

set for the representatives “dic- _

tates that [Shandley and Gullan]
act quickly while still maintaining
the integrity and openness of the
process.”

Gullan hopes that the students
on the committees will be the

“glasses ‘through which the trust-
ees see campus life” and that the
trustees will have a “clearer vision
of campus life through this repre-
sentation.”

He believes that “more input
from those who are on campus

almost all the time can only aid the
trustees in their decisions.”

Warren Buford, SGA Vice
President, sees student representa-
tion as a “necessity” fora school of
Davidson’s size to ensure “com-
plete representation.”
