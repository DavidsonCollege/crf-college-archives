Short Orientation
Forecast For Fall

By BRODIE BROWN
Staff Writer

Freshman orientation next fall
will be shorter and more “‘in-
forma! and relaxed.”’ according
to Freshman Advisers Tom
Clayton and Clay Ford.

A variety of recreational ac-
tivity has been planned for the
freshmen. Movies. ping pong
and pool tournaments, a mixer”
with Queens. and the Union Ac.
tivities Fair will add entertain-
ment and a casual atmosphere.
to the orientation period.

I

A number of activities previ-
ously held during the orientation
period will be postponed or can-
celled.

Talks on the Honor Court,
Student Council and the serious
values of the college have all
been postponed until the first
freshman assemblies.

P.E, tests will be conducted
during the ‘first P.E. classes.
The tour of the infirmary has
been cancelled. and the tour of
the library placed on a volun.
tary basis.

As a result of removing mariy
such items, orientation ‘will. be
one day shorter. lasting. from
Sept. 8-12.

Attendance at freshman camp.
which will deal with college ed
-ucation in general rather than
Davidson specifically, will be
strongly recommended hut not
required. “Clay and I feel that
a mandatory freshman camp
would destroy the relaxed atmos.
phere that we hope to achieve."
said Clayton.

The Freshman Court will be
re-established next year to deal
with violations of the use of
beanies and nametags. The
court, already elected by the
Student Council. will give pun-
ishment in the nature of. con-
structive projects around cam-
pus.

ED. NOTE: This is the
second of a series of three
articles dealing with the de-
cision-making process at Da-
vidson.

By CHARLES McEWEN

Copy Editor

Two deans, familiar to most
students if only by their repu-
tations, supervise student and
aeademic affairs at Davidson.

In the structure for decision
making. both the Dean of the
Faculty and the Dean of Stu-
dents report directly to the
president. In addition the Dean
of the Faculty becomes the
chief administrator of the col-
lege when the president is out
of town,

With the revised structure of
the college. the Office of the
Dean of the Faculty has per-
haps been one of the most en
larged in the scope of its op.
erations.

Before this year, his office
had been primarily concern-
ed with faculty recruitment
and curriclum changes, sald
Dr. Frontis Johnston, dean
of the faculty. Of course,
there were a lot of routine
matters as well, he pointed
out. .

“In a sense, I'm just getting
used to this (the revised struc
ture). Yet I think this-is a
sensible sort of alignment.”

Citing an example, Johnston
pointed out that under the new
plan, the Admissions Commit-
tee reports to him instead of
directly to the president.

“I don’t pretend to admin-
ister the offices that report to
me. I don’t make any pre-
tense - of controlling them.”
Johnston said.

Thus the dean's office is on
one sense a filtering plant for
requests from the offices un:
der its supervision. Some de-
cisions are naturally referred
to the president or even to the
trustees for decision.

As in the past, the Dean of
the Faculty is still called
on for decisions in curric-
ulum and faculty matters.
Initiation for curriculum
changes first come from the
department concerned. John-
ston said. From there a pro
posal goes to the faculty Cur.

siders the proposal, and then
the matter goes before the full
faculty for consideration.

“One person cannot change
the curriculum," Johnston em-
phasized. His role in stich
changes is one of coordination:
the receiving of requests from
various departments and re-
quests from students. Often.
the student requests are .for
changes in requirements, rath-.
er than for curriculum changes
per se.

In regard to students, John-
ston stressed that no one man
can dismiss a student (nor
can any one man admit a stu-
dent to Davidson).

Rather. such. action comes
from committees, usually the
faculty Executive or Curric-
ulum Committee.

“This makes for a lot of

meetings and it takes a lot
of time,” Johnston sald. Bul
“4 never resent the time it
takes to listen to a student's
request,” he continued.

In the recruitment of facul-
ty. ‘'The authority to recom-
mend appointment is mine,”
Johnston said. “But I don't
do this without consulting the
department involved,”’ he con-
tinued.

In addition, appointment of
faculty members must be ap-
proved by the Board of Trus-
tees. “Usually they don't ob
ject’’. but Johnston said that
it is his policy not to release
the names of new faculty
members until after their ap-
pointments have been made
official by the trustees.

Johnston went on to outline
the steps taken .in hiring a

new faculty member. “If we
want a man in, say, the De-
partment of Economics, we al-
ways bring the prospect to
the campus for a visit. Not
only can we see him. but he
can see the college,"’ Johnston
said.

The decision to hire a
prospective member of the
faculty is first made by the
Dean of the Faculty and the
head of the department in-
volved. The president and
then the trustees must ap-
Prove appointments.

In another area, the Dean
of the Faculty must decide on
the rank not only for new fac-
ulty members, but also for ad-
vances in rank of present fac-
ulty members. In this matter,
“I usually get the advice of
the departments involved. and
sometimes I get outside ad-
vice,"" Johnston said.

“My biggest problem is the
mail,"” Johnston said with a
wry smile. He poirited out that
there were many little ‘‘house-
keeping’ details involyed with.
his position as well as major
important deci.
sions in the academic area.

Student affairs, ranging
from disciplinary matters to
student housing, come under
the supervision of Richard
C. Burts, dean of students.

“Students get the idea that -

I'm the kind of fellow who
doesn’t believe in water
fights." Burts said.

Burts was using this as an
example of one of the types of
decisions that he must make.
He is called on to distinguish
between a water fight is mere
‘“‘fun’’ and one that has gotten
out of control, resulting in real
damage.

Executive decisions. gener-
ally in situations when a stu-
dent has broken some rule,

are a part of the decisions

that the Dean of Students
must make.

In cases when there is some
question about what disciplin--
ary measures will be handed
out, a studerit’s case will be
brought before the Executive
Committee of the faculty.
(This is an elective committee,
consisting of the president, the
two deans and six elected fac-
ulty members.)

Other types of decisions
that the dean’s office must
make involve counseling and
referral cases. Sometimes
cases where problems of
what Is termed “‘total adjust-
ment” come to his attention.
Usually, in the last instance,
the problem may be an off-
campus problem, involving
police or court cases.

Burts pointed out the para.
dox involved with his job. ‘I
af the first man to hear about
some things and the last man
to hear about others.”’ he said.

In dealing with students, def-
initely Burts’ major job, the
problem of communication

The

crops up.

“Often a negative situation
exists before I get to it.”
Burts said. He must deal with
students who are withdrawing
from Davidson, as well as stu-
dents’ academic problems re-
ferred to him by faculty mem-
bers.

In such cases, the dean is
usually the “last man to
hear.” Yet this is still an area
where a decision must be
made.

Matters of liaison are also
part of the function of the
Office of the Dean of Stu-
dents. Burts pointed to the
“diffusion of academic re-
sponsibility’ at Davidson.
“The fact is that ’m an ac-
ademic dean, too,” he said.

Thus, the Dean of Students
must make decisions that are
in a sense compromises. Some-
times he must mediate be-
tween faculty requests on one
side, and student requests on
the other. ‘‘And I do get
caught sometimes’ between
the two, Burts said.
