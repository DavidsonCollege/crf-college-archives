THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 15, 1925 :

All Continentals Swamp
Light Davidson Hi Squad

Large Crowd Cheers as Heavy All-
Continental Team Wins

Richardson Field, Oct. 9.—Science was
victor over brutal strength in a thrilling con-

test last Friday afternoon here. The All-
Continentals defeated the heavy Davidson
High team by the score of 20-0. It was

‘clearly a struggle of brute force ‘versus cun-
ning strategy. The many long afternoons
and nights spent in the study of the science
proved the salvation of the light team and
science once more emerged from the conflict
with the wreath of a well-earned victory.

The large Davidson bowl was crowded to
capacity and countless hordes were turned
away disappointed at the gates. The High
School team trotted on the field at 4:16 3-4
P. X. and were cheered loudly. The Conti-
nentals were delayed on account of the fact
that some low conspirator had stolen the
shoe-strings of their star fullback, “linky”
Carter, Just 8 3-16 minutes later, they dash-
ed to the field led by their indomitable leader,
Capt. “Elijah” Lovelace. All the fair dam-
sels in the enormous multitude immediately
shrieked for “their choice.”

After announcing the batteries for the
game, Referee McMillan tossed up the ball,
the high gained the tip-off and made six
inches. The two lines lined up. Never have |
such giants appeared on Richardson Field be- |
fore. Irving, the giant of the Continentals, |
towered over the entire line in all the glory |
of his massive strength. He weighed 100}
pounds, soaking wet.

|
The ball was turned over to the Conti- |

nentals.to play with a while and “Post |
Brand began calling signals. As he could |
only count to ten, “Jelly” Jennings grabbed |
the ball, went through the hole opened up by |
“Shine” McClain and “Mighty” Martin, |
dashed down the field for.a gain of six and|
three-quarter inches,

Soon the ball was shoved across by “Mag-
pie” Brand and “Kute” Kugler kicked goal.

jnow among the largest power companies in
| the South,

| A little less than a year ago Mr. Duke set
| aside forty millions of dollars for the benefit
|of educational and charitable institutions in
North and South Carolina, He did not give
| these donations in the form of money, but
jin stock in the Southern’ Power Company.
| The institutions are not allowed to dispose |
lof this stock, but semi-annually will receive |
| dividends from it. Of the amount sct aside,
Davidson was the recipient of two millions |
ies dollars of this stock, the yearly dividends,
| which will begin to pay in 1926, will amount |
to something like $75,000, |

Mr. Duke was born near Durham, N. c,|
}in 1856. He received his education in the |
country schools nearby, and entered into the |
business with which his father was connected |
when he was quite young. After he became
ja prominent figure he bought a large estate |
|near Somerville, N. J., where he spent sev- |
jeral years. The grounds of this estate: are |
undoubtedly among the most beautiful in |
the country, and until a few years ago were
open to the public. |

Besides being of great financial aid to)
many educational institutions in this and
nearby states, Mr. Duke has aided many
hospitals and other charitable institutions in |
the South. He has also built a great number |
of churches. As he was a Methodist he |
naturally helped the Methodist Church most, |
although he has been generous to other de- |
nominations also.

In speaking of Mr. Duke in the chapel ex-
ercises last Monday morning Dr, Martin
brought out the fact that in turning over the
stock in the Southern Power Company to
these denominational institutions that Mr.
Duke had harnessed the water streams in
North and South Carolina and was making |
them work “for the glory of God.”

Dr. Martin, in the name of Davidson Col-
lege, sent Mrs. Duke and her daughter a
telegram last Monday. The college sent a
floral offering, and the student body sent a
telograez ci..cendolence to the bereaved
family.

In honor of the man who, more than any
one other had benefited their city, Charlotte
closed all of its business houses from the
hours of 11 a. m.-to noon, the hour in which
Mr. Duke was buried. ‘A special train, spon-
sored by the Southern Power Company, and
bearing its employees besides hundreds of

number open, to be filled by a volunteer.

The recent meeting of the Pandeinic
Society was notable for a very interest-
}ing program; the best that has been given
‘so far this year.

The subject for debate was: “Resolved, |
that the United States should have a de- |
| partment of aeronautics.” This is a ques- |

{tion which is being given considerable

Speakers on the affirmative were W. K.
Pritchett and W. E. Hill, while those up-
holding the negative were E. C. Speir
and W. M. Regen. The verdict of the
judges was in favor of the affirmative by
a unanimous vote.

/' A declamation by M. A. Steele and an
| oration by S. W. Moore completed the
| program. Both were good and well de-
| livered.

The meeting was the best that has been

| indicative of a very successful year.
