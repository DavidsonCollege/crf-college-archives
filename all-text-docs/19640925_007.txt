“IT’S EASY TO CRITICIZE...”

__ it is awfully easy to criticize,” noted football Coach
Bill Dole Wednesday night in an evidently pointed re-

mark at the Open End discussion.

Maybe so. But it is easier to be optimistic than to try
to be objective and present a well-reasoned opinion.

1 don’t want to dwell at length on this subject be-
cause it has caused enough hard feelings already. How-
ever, the criticism referred to amounts to two statements
made in last week’s newspaper. One expressed a distaste
for Davidson's new black helments—this, of course, is|
an aesthetic opinion, and I don’t see why a difference in
uniform taste should cause hard feelings.

The other statement related this writer’s prediction
that Davidson will win three games, the most optimistic
forecast of any predicting publication. I hope, of course,
that this prediction is an underestimation, but I feel
the first consideration of a journalist (and especially a|
forecaster) is objectivity and sincerity if his opinion is
to have any value.

1 said that we will probably win three games from
among the contests with Mississippi College, P. C., La-
fayette, and Lehigh. Coach Dole puts these four encount-
ers in the category of probable victories and adds VMI,
Wofford, and The Citadel.

| hope he is right, but I also hope that future differ-
ences of opinion will not be a cause for hard feelings.

NO REST FOR LEFTY

Basketball coach Lefty Driesell didn’t get to slow
down much this summer—he lectured at and participated
in seven basketball clinics, varying from one day in
length to two weeks.

Davidson‘s two-time Southern Conference Coach of
the Year lectured at two coaching clinics—the Stetson
College Clinic in Daytona Beach and the Adelphi Col-
lege Clinic in Garden City, Long Island. The Adelphi

opponents” in the conference

courses of slightly more than
two miles, is regarded by Whit-
tle to be “a well-balanced
group” with a strong chance

clinic is probably the best in the East and also included
George Ireland of Chicago Loyola and Dave Strack of
Michigan as lecturers.

Lefty also lent his knowledge to several ‘basketball
schools for players. He taught at the Pocono Mountain
Basketball School at East Stroudsburg, Pa., the Lynch-
burg (Va.) Basketball School, and conducted, with the
aid of Davidson freshman coach Terry Holland, a school
of his own at Newport News.

Holland and Wildcat aces Dick Snyder and Barry St.
Clair joined Lefty as instructors at the Campbell College
Basketball School at Buie’s Creek.

And Lefty isn’t through yet—he journeys to Dur-
ham, October 31, to instruct at another coaches clinic.

well.”

While he realizes that soc-
cer fans will try to compare
this year’s team with the
sensational squad of ’63,
Coach Harry Fogelman is
careful not to make such a
comparison himself.

“It's really too early to say
anything about the outlook this
year,” stated Fogleman. With
cautious optimism he added,

Serious practice started only
a few days ago and mistakes
were prevalent during the team

Cross-country coach Heath
Whittle, who originated the

the starting gun. The fresh-
men were off like a herd of
turtles. As they slowly faded
out of sight into the woods, the
last one was seen exhibiting
typical freshman exuberance,
puffing contentedly on a
cigarette.
