THE DAVIDSONIAN

Founded 1914

A Role To Play

The French novelist Albert Camus once noted that no
writer can be a complete cynic because the very act of
writing demonstrates at least some bellef in the world’s
goodness. In somewhat the same fashion, no one can
edit The Davidsonian well unless they believe in Davidson
College. | believe in Davidson’s potential, and | believe
The Davidsonian can play a very significant role in making
Davidson better.

To do this, The Davidsonian must report news about or
affecting Davidson in hopes of interesting and, most
important, informing its readership. The more informa-
tion the members of a community have about it, the
easier it is for them to improve it. |

Presently, the most important news concerns David-
son’s financial situation and its vast affect on many areas
of the College such as faculty salaries and athletics.
These issues are not always pleasant to discuss and
many students find them very boring. As a result, The
Davidsonian has not adequately fulfilled its duty to
interest readers under my editorship. Yet the biggest
question on the mind of anyone who really cares about
the College must be how to insure that hard financial
times do not lower the quality of the Davidson education
which we all value, and it is The Davidsonian’s
responsibility to cover the many differect aspects of this
question.

The Davidsonian must inform and educate its readers
instead of merely reminding them of things they already
know. A good newspaper does not run stories revealing
the fact that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west.
| have not often used The Davidsonian to remind students
that we have an excellent faculty, for example. It is not
news to me that Davidson is a good school, and | doubt it
would be news to many others here. .

The Davidsonian must be truly critical in order to really
serve the College community. Davidson is not perfect,
and | have based many of my editorials on the premise
that people here are committed to making Davidson better
and will benefit from an examination of some of

Davidson’s problems. The Davidsonian must present.

these problems to the campus community and suggest
solutions to them if possible.

Yet students and administration have misinterpreted
both my editorials and: their intent. People still think The
Davidsonian is against minor sports even though our
concern for minor sports has been a large motivation
behind The Davidsonian’s coverage of the athletic budget.
(For example: “We hope the College recognizes the
importance of minor sports and funds them accordingly”
appears in a December 5 editorial. in my lead editorial of
October 14, | say “Budgets for so-called ‘minor sports’
should not suffer at the expense of pumping more money
into football and basketball.”)

Readers have labeled this critical approach as
“negative” and maintain. it is had for Davidson. | cannot
see how pointing out Davidson’s problems and offering
solutions is negative. Instead, | feel that identifying
Davidson’s weaknesses is the first step towards making it
a better. place. | have not spent 40 to 50 hours a week at
the expense of study and sleep to tear down Davidson.

Davidson and Davidson people have done much for me,
and | am very glad | have had the opportunity to partially

continue to contribute to Davidson's well-being and urge

No Excuse

To the Editor:

After an untimely resurrec-
tion from my shadowy demise-
by-audio cone last Thursday, I
felt the need to respond to SAE
President Blaine Sanders’ chill-
ing rebuttal to my audacious
complaint of one week prior,
concerning the SAE party of
December 1.

Despite what Mr. Sanders
implied, I have nothing against
‘blowing off a little steam’’
after a long hard Thanksgiving
break. My complaint, repre-
senting many prudes and study
nerds in Belk and other dorms,
was solely directed at the
needless blasting of music from
the house at 2 a.m. Whether
such racket is made by the
pillars of the campus commun-
ity or the Franciscan friars is of
little matter to someone who is
trying to get some sleep on a
week night:

My conclusion, that the
SAE’s must not be concerned
with being models of fraternity
living, was, admittedly, rash
and unfair. But by answering
defensively when a simple apol-
ogy would have sufficed, Mr.
Sandes’ reply can only have
served to tarnish the-reputation
of what must otherwise be, by
his own proofs, a good, respect-

“Registration Update
To the Editor:

. During the: week of January _
‘5, 1981, those males born in

1962 will be legally required to
register for the draft. Whether
to do so or not is a difficult

choice. Here are some facts that
you may not know about the
draft and registration:

—There will be no education,
Peace Corps, or Vista exemp-
tions under the new draft, as
currently proposed.

— There is currently no mech-
anism for registering for con-
scientious objector status or
any other status prior to receiv-
ing your induction notice.

—According to current pro-
posals, you will have 10 days
from the date the draft notice is
mailed to file for conscientious
objector or other exemption
status.

—According to current pro-
posals, if you are once denied
conscientious objector status,
there will be no appeal.

—During the time, most of
the discovered non-registrants
were given a second opportuni-
ty to register and were not
prosecuted if they complied.

—The maximum penalty for
refusal to register or advocating
non-registration is five years
imprisonment and/or a $10,000
fine. It should be noted that
never has the maximum penalty
been imposed on anyone for
either of these felonies.

—A conservative govern-
ment estimate says that 7% of
eligible males did not register
this past summer. This is
approximately 290,000 people.
(Roughly 10% times the capaci-
ty of the federal prison system.)

—You are not legally re-
quired to fill in your social
security number on your regis-

tration form. This could be

important if you are considering
draft evasion, as it will probab-
ly improve your chance’ of
avoiding being found.

—There has never been re-
gistration without a draft, and
never a draft without a war.

If you are confused and need
more information or just some-
one to talk to, there will be»
soméone available in the Con-
versation Pit of the Davidson

' College Union from 7-9 p.m.
