WILDCAT NINE
DROPS TWO GAMES
TO DUKE

As FELIX Sees

By LAMONT BROWN

Davidson suffered a severe attack on
its athletic front last week with three
out of four varsity teams encountering
defeat. Only the Wildcat netmen saved
the ‘Cats athletic record from complete
rout, by their successful invasion of
Virginia.

Meanwhile, however, the Kit-
tens took over a little spark and
fire to decisively outpoint their op-
pents in both track and baseball,
and thus considerably eased the
pain of defeat handed the varsity
teams.

‘CATS FALL DOWN

The title of the song “I Fa’ Down and
Go Boom” might have been applied to
the baseball team last week, who, al-
though they exhibited good collegiate
ball, had to release its hold on the attic
of the big tive conference to Duke. The
Blue Devils demonstrated some high
class willow swinging besides having a
trio of fielders worth any big league's
attention,

With Davidson trailing by three
runs, the ‘cats came to bat in the
seventh inning with several hun-
dred dent pectators st di
in traditional manner, Roping
against fate for a turning point.
A brief period of thrilling ball
saw Davidson with one run to its
credit with bases loaded, but a
long fly to left field descended into
waiting hands to end the good
luck streak.

‘At Southern Pines before a crowd of
some five thousand, the 'Cats opened up
the fireworks and took an early lead,
tho’ Duke garnered enough in six in-
nings to tie.

However, Ace Parker slammed
out another homer, the second in
two days, to defeat the home
team. The game featured the um-
piring of an old Army sergeant
who naturally knew more about
cannonballs than he did baseballs
SG ly both t suf-
fered.

CINDERMEN LOSE

The Vols outdid themselves Saturday,
no doubt inspired by some close compe-
tition from Wildcat cindermen, to break
two of their own records. Due to a high
wind, these records came near being dis-

qualified as such, although ™ officials
deemed it O K after some considera-
tion.

Paul Pittman came within a few

h of crashi the lleg
pole vault record by sailing over
the horizontal bar at 12 feet.
John Lee followed Pitt in second
place with 11 feet 6 inches, which
is plenty good considering Johnny
has been ble to parti
with the squad for the past month
because of a broken foot bone.
Needlees to say Earl Frazier car-
ried off two firsts in the distances
with characteristic easy style.

RACQUETEERS BACK

Ed Garrett and his crew of Varsity
tennis stars returned Sunday after what
we might term a successful invasion of
Virginia, although two out of the three
arranged matches were called off for
rain. The locals bowled over the Uni-
versity of Richmond in fine style and
had little trouble in doing so.

TENNESSEE’S TRACKMEN
WIN OVER WILDCATS

Frazier, Parker, Potter, And
Siewers Take First Places

For Davidson
TWO RECORDS BROKEN

Anderson, Of Tennessee, Is High
Scorer Of Windy Meet

A hard fighting Wildcat track team
was beaten by the cindermen of the
University of Tennessee Saturday after-
noon in Knoxville. Two records for the
University trackmen were broken by the
Vols’ ace runner, Harry Anderson, so
that it was no ordinary team to which
Davidson bowed.

Paul Pittman made a new high for
himself as he won the pole vault by
crossing the bar at 12 feet; Audtey Gam-
mon tied his highest jump of five feet,
ten inches, to take a second place for
the Wildcats. Frazier was first in the
mile run, his time being 4:36.5, Dick-
son came second in the hundred-yard
dash, and second in the two-twenty; By-
erly was third tn this latter event. Park-
er and Byerly were first and third, re-
spectively, in the one-twenty, and John-
son was third in the four-forty. Fra-
zier won the eight-eighty in 2:03.4, and
Gullette won the two-mile run in 10 :29.7,
Pittman placed third in the two-twenty
low hurdles.

In the field events Potter and Siewers
placed first and second in the shot put,
Potter's distance being 39°914", Siewers,
Tipton, and Potter won first, second, and
third places in the discus throw, the
winning throw being 1132”. Johnston
was second in the javelin throw, and
Dickson third in the broad jump. Lee,
of Davidson, tied with Pritchett for sec-
ond place in the pole vault.

Anderson was high scorer for Ten-
nessee, winning firsts in both the 100
and the 220-yard dashes, and in the high
and broad jumps. Other first place win-
ners for Tennessee were Sledge, who
won the 440-yard run, and Jeffries, who
won the javelin throw. Tennessee's re-
lay team won the mile race in 3:35.8, to
bring the Vols’ total score to 72 points,
as oppposed to Davidson's 59 points. Al-
though the entire meet took place in a
high wind, the new records set by An-
derson will stand, the Athletic Council
of that school has ruled.

behind the courts at Myers Park Coun-
try Club.

However, they did not fall in the &
rection of the players so no one was
disturbed and the play was not inter-
rupted.

The freshman have another meet with
N. C. State freshman Saturday morning,
April 20.

Georgia Tech Golfers
Defeat Davidson Team

Davidson’s varsity golfers took it on
the chin in their return match with
Georgia Tech on the Carolina Club links
in Charlotte last Friday. The two teams
met in Atlanta several days ago at which

time the Yellow Jackets gained a 17 to
1 verdict. Their Friday win was by a
16%-1'% count.

The Techmen, led by their famous

Yates-Moore combination, were superior
to the Wildcats in all departments of
play. They took all points except in
the number four match, In this: battle
Charlie Hamrick of Davidson and Rid-
ley of the visitors broke even. Yates
and Moore were low men with seventy-
fours. The former was not playing his
best brand of golf and: revealed his dis-
pleasure with himself on the fifth hole
where he wrapped his number one iron
around a tree. Snow and Cowan were
“low” for the ‘Wildcats with seventy-
sevens.

The summary of the match:

Yates, Tech (74) defeated Snow (77)
3-0; Moore, Tech (74) defeated Cowan
(77), 3-0; Dannals, Tech (75), defeated
Ross (80), 3-0; Hamrick, Davidson (80),

Moore defeated Snow and Cowan 3-0;
Dannals and Ridley defeated Ross and
Hamrick, 3-0. ‘Total: Tech, 1614; Da-
vidson, 1%.

Seniors Wallop Frosh
In Softball Game 35-14

In a game featured by heavy hitting,
the Seniors defeated the Freshmen in
the first game of intramural soft-ball
competition, 35-14. Heavy slugging
played its part and unusual fielding,
mostly by the Frosh, did much to add
interest to the game.

This game was played with a soft
ball, thus explaining the big score. For
the Seniors, Pitcher “Duster” Hutchins

and Hugh Yelverton were outstanding, |’

while Dixon, Vause, Reid, and» Rainey
starred for the Frosh.

Brittain started on the mound for the
F ¥snmen, but retired in favor of Rainey
after the third inning. Hutchins went
the entire route from the upperclass-
men and kept the hits well scattered
except in the sixth inning when they
combined hits and walks for a total of
nine runs. The heavy bats of the Sen-
iors brought home thirteen runs in the
fourth inning, eight in the seventh in-
ning, and six in the eighth inning. Vause
pitched the last four innings and would
have held the Senior batsmen in check
except for shoddy support.

‘Tomorrow, the Sophomores meet the
Junibrs in the second game of the intra-
mura!. soft-ball program. The Seniors
play the Sophomores on.Wednesday; the
Freshmen play the Juniors on Thurs-
day, and ‘the Juniors and Seniors meet
on Friday; The remaining games will
be played ‘the first of next week.

Duke Edges Out Davidson In
Second Game 6-3

Last week-end the Davidson Wildcats
took two successive defeats in a row
from the hard slugging Blue Devils nine
from Durham. Both games were fea-
tured by an attempt at a Wildcat rally
in each. In the first game, the rally
in the seventh inning looked as though
it would be successful but fell through
in the last half of the eighth. The first
game was played here on Friday after-
noon, the next game was played at South-
ern Pines on Saturday afternoon as a
featured part of the Spring festival.

Davidson 1; Duke 5.

The game progressed without score
until the first half of the second inning
when Wagner, the Blue Devil catcher,
stepped to the plate and slammed one
over the left field fence for one of the
two homers of the game. The next home

run followed directly behind its mate as
“Ace” Parker smacked the second one
far into center field for two home runs
in succession for the Blue Devils. The
next Devil run came in the fdurth in-
ning, and it was not until the eighth in-
ning that were able to put over the last
two runs. For the Wildcats, Morgan
scored the only run of the afternoon
when he hit a long ball between center
field and left field, the ball bounded di-
rectly for the open gate but suddenly
took a bound to the right of it and went
into the hedge, the Duke center fielder
fished it out in time to hold Morgan to a
three bagger. The next man up was
Jim Dixon, who after two lusty swings,
singled to bring in Morgan for the only
Wildcat score of the afternoon. Harris
was the losing pitcher, and Weafer
pitched for the winners.

Davidson 3; Duke 6.

The Southern Pines baseball fans wit-
nessed a hard-fought game which was
apparently evenly contested until the
eighth inning. The score remained three
all until the eighth inning, when Parker
stepped up to bat with two out and two
on bases. Soon, the situation became more
tense after Parker had one strike called
on him and had taken 4a slice at another
he then tripled to bring in two runs.
Another run was scored against the
Wildcats earlier in the game when it was
ruled that Ravenel had interferred with
a runner coming in to home from third;
the run was given to the Devils on this
The three Wildcat runs were
scored by Ravenel, Harris, who was
playing left field, and Mackorell. Jack
Jenkins was the losing pitcher and “Nak”
