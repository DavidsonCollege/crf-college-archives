As individuals we face our own
combinations of doubts and fears.
Because Davidson College is a place
where there are many highly indivi-
dual people, getting = genegal consen-
sus on personal frustrations is diffi-
cult.

How do some students feel about
the anxieties of life at Davidson?

Most people seem to feel that their
sophomore year was their worst.
However, freshman year seems to call
put it this way, “‘As a freshman. I
expected too much and tried too hard.
The frustration comes from these

Sophomore year makes things
worse instead of better for many

people. A senior psychology major
simply said, “Sophomore year was
the pits." A junior added, “‘My
sophomore year was probably the
worst year of my life.”
Home will never be the same

These people cited personal reasons
as the main cause compounded by
other senior put it this way, “‘The
initial excitement of college life has
worn off. Plus you suddenly realize
that your home will never be the same
since you've been away for awhile.
But the really big hassle for many
people is deciding their major.”

Generally, during the junior year,
life improves for most people. One
learns to operate within the system of
Davidson and the particular worries
of senior year seem far away.

One junior described it this way,
“First of all you suddenly realize you
are halfway through. You are aiso
much more free to take courses you
like and really get into your major. In
addition, there seems to be a change
of attitude in students and professors
toward each other.

‘Professors begin to see you less as
a high school juvenile and they seem
to be more human and less pompous,”’
he added.

A senior pre-med disagreed, ‘I had
fun my first two years. Junior year I
had to start worrying about getting
into med school. I’ve been really
frustrated by a lack of guidance in a
time when I’ve needed it most.”

worry is about what’s going to
happen after graduation—for me it's
med school, for some of my friends
it ‘s simply a job,” * said one senior.
Another senior observed, “Another
big disappointment is knowing fewer
and fewer people on campus.”

Students listed many aspects of life
which frustrated them. Some are
peculiar to Davidson; some are more
universal.

‘If we weren't so academically
frustrated we wouldn’t be so socially
frustrated,’’ declared one student.
Another individual expressed his
observations on the situation in more
depth, ‘‘Everything here at Davidson
is focused inward. This is the whole
world; your existence becomes your
grades and classroom experiences.

‘*There are mirrors where there
should be..windows and it causes you
to lose your perspective on the rest of

the world,” he said.

Handbook completed

By EMILY MASON
Staff Writer

The Hourly Staff Handbook, a
statement of college hiring, firing,
and promotion practices affecting the
some 150 hourly paid staff workers
and their supervisors, was distributed
to all concerned on Tuesday, Oct. 5.

Robert Stephenson, Director of
Personnel and Administrative
Services and the coordinator of the
project, described the handbook as
“an effort to brong-existing policies
together into one booklet,”’ a
“communications device."

Thé main body of material included
is either a summary of the procedures
which have already been: in practice
but which have not been codified, or is
a restatement of policies that have
previously been distributed in booklet
form to Davidson College employees.

The Greivance Procedure, as an
adaptation of the Title IX civil rights.
statute, is a clear example of an
already existing college policy which
had never been produced in written
form. This procedure is a statement of
what the employees can expect from

“~

Almighty Grade

Another student added, “I don’t —
think students at larger universities
where I’ve been are as frustrated
because they have more outlets to
express themselves. People here are
too obsessed with the Almighty
Grade to care about anything else.”’

There are as many individual
frustrations as there are people at
Davidson. Most people do seem to
feel that the college hasn’t done and
isn’t doing enough to help. Two
seniors said that the way to “‘solve”’ —
the frustration problem is not to
ever, “If you don’t have expectations
you stop striving for any goals which
is frustrating in itself.”

“Part of what’s good about David-
son and part of what’s bad about
Davidson ,"” observed an English ma-
jor, “is that we are left on our own to
muddle through our problems the
best way we can.”

greivances.

The remainder of the three sections
of the handbook dealing with
Condi-
tions of Employment, Compensation
and Related Policies, and Employee
Benefits are all re-presentations of
College practices already in effect.

Due to be completed in the fall of
1975, the Handbook was postponed
for a year as a result of Stevenson's
other obligations. In commenting on
the delay, Stevenson said, ‘I wanted
it (the Handbook) as badly as anyone;
it was just a matter of priorities.

“We finally had some time to get it
together this summer, and I’m glad.”
And he added, “It’s good to have it so
it can be seen and scinaioede under-
stood.”

The compilation of the: ‘Handbook
was taken on by Stevenson as an
additional project. Typed and
processed primarily by the secretaries
themselves, the finished report was
read and-#pproved by College Presi-

he could not find Rees.

Baskin commented, ‘‘May-
be that’s negligence but I
thought it went without say-
ing that we take him at his
word. I didn’t want to deny
him a chance to run.

There were no candidates
who filed to run as Watts
dorm senator, probably due to
poor publicity. Two students
interested in running said they
were unaware of the election
until after the filing deadline.
The SGA is considering; a
special ‘“‘in-dorm referendum”
in Watts next week. The
winner of the referendum
would then be appointed by
os Senate.
