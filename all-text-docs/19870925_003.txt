just way too much for laundry ser-
vice — especially if it is mandat-
ory. Some people don’t even use
the service. I’ve been here three
years and I may send a load in
once a month and when I get it
back it’s usually burned to a
crisp... I didn’t even know I
was payliig that much.

First of all I feel that $310 is —

Morrow Reeves ’88:

Why is it mandatory? Not ev-

erybody wants to do their laundry -

there. Some people prefer to do it
on their own and if that’s the case
they should fave that option to use
the money they pay the laundry to
do their own. . . buy their own
detergent .. .

Patricio Zaldumbide ’90
Well, I don’t think it should be
mandatory. You should have the
option of doing your own clothes.
I personally don’t agree with it.

What do you think about Davidson's laundry fee?

Frank Whitaker 89.
I think it’s a quality laundry ser-
vice that we are privileged to have
here at Davidson College. I don’t
mind paying quality prices for
quality product.

Let me put it this way: When I
was deciding where to go to
school it came down to two
schools — either | Washington
and Lee or Davidson. When I
found out Washington and Lee
didn’t have a laundry service,
Idecided to come to Davidson
within the next two hours:

Secrecy without snokeilled rooms

Examining the Davidson tenure process

By TRIPP HELMS

A recent’ tenure decision at
Davidson has brought the tenure
system into the forefront of cam-
pus discussion and caused many
to give the system a second look.
Many students, however, .might
be unsure of what exactly tenure
means and how it is granted. .

Tenure is designed to protect
the freedom of professors to exer-
cise the right of free speech in and
out of the classroom. It does this
by giving a professor a lifetime
appointment so that presenting
controversial or unpopular ideas
will not get a professor fired.

The Davidson system for
granting tenure follows the gen-
eral guidelines set forth by the
American Association of Univer-
sity Professors and is specifically
outlined in the code of faculty

employment at Davidson as a reg-

‘ular faculty member, he or she is

usually given a two year renewa-
ble contract. During the second
year, the renewal decision is made
by the administration on the basis
of evaluations by faculty peers,
students, department chairmen
and the administration. —

If the contract is renewed, the
professor is given another two-
year contract. During the fourth
year, the evaluation process is re-

: peated and another renewal deci-

sion is made.

A second contract renewal,
again for a period of two years,
begins the process that culminates
in either the granting of tenure or
the termination of employment. A
third evaluation is carried out. Al-

though it is more extensive and the —

standards are higher, the criteria

professional activity, and service.
Teaching ability carries the most
weight in a tenure review accord-
ing to Robert Williams, Vice-
president for Academic Affairs
and Dean of Faculty. Professional
activity and service are also very
important to the decision even
though they are given less weight.

Professional activity is not
limited to the publication of
books; it also includes participa-
tion in conferences, research, and
sabbatical programs. Williams
believes that this professional ac-
tivity “reflects a quality of mind
that extends into the classroom.”

contributions fall into three
catagories: “concern for students,
service to the. institution, and ser-
vice to the wider community.”
Availability to students, work on
faculty committees, and participa-
tion in church and civic organiza-
tions are among the contributions
condidered.

Evaluations from faculty, stu-
dents, and outside sources are pre-
sented to the Dean of Faculty
under the present system. Based
on these evaluations the Dean
makes a recommendation to the
President, who then takes it to the

£ven though the quantity of time Board of Trustees for action.

~ All faculty and outside evalua-

them. This confidentiality creates
a problem, states Williams, be-
cause no one but he and the Presi-
dent know all of the factors in a_
decision. The result is that the fac-
ulty may complain about a deci-
sion.-without knowing all of the
circumstances.

According to Williams, most
institutions have a faculty-elected
personnel committee that sees all
of the evidence and makes a rec-
ommendation or offers advice.
Williams would like to see this
system implemented at. Davidson
because “the faculty does not fully
accept the present system.”

The creation of a faculty per-
sonnel committee at Davidson
will be discussed this year. The
last time this measure was intro-
duced, the faculty voted against it
and for the present system. Recent

evaluation procedures (CNFP) of are the same. utions are also weighed, although tions are held strictly confidential _ reaction by faculty to the tenure

The Comptroller’s office has
received many phone calls from

concerns, the Comptroller’s of-
fice has asserted that the laundry
fee must be mandatory in order for
continued operation of any laun-
dry services. :

Ms. Beaver stresses that the
laundry service is here for the stu-
dents and that any suggestions that
they may have she will be glad to

listen to them. She‘ also reminds —
