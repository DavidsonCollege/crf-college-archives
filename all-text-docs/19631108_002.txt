Sticks And Carrots

- In the last several years Davidson
College has made some outstanding
strides toward attaining academic ex-
cellence. Programs such as Humani-
ties, Senior Research, and Advanced
Standing have been instituted, and the
seminar program has been enlarged.
A Fine Arts Building has been built,
and art, music, and drama have begun
receiving long overdue attention. Also,
student-led projects such as the Great
Issues series have been encouraged
and subsidized by the present admin-
istration. ;

This year, however, it seems as if
the college has suddenly looked back
over its shoulder to see academic
stragglers in the student body. It also
seems that rather than continuing to
place emphasis on strengthening in-
tellectual incentives in curricular and
extra-curricular programs, the college
has chosen to pick up a brickbat with
which to beat said stragglers upon
their heads.

Having spent the past. two weeks on
the matter of Academic Probation
(which the faculty liberalized — this
week), we turn to the rejuvenated Un-
derachievement Program, which we.
were hitherto led to believe was an
innocent attempt to rid the college of
non-contributing vegetation.

However, apparently the college
intends to make a bit more of their
policy on Underachievement than we
had anticipated. In the latest Alumni
Bulletin, the cover article is a collec-
tion of unadulterated nonsense grand-
ly entitled “Academic Excellence at
Davidson: A Move Against Under-
achievement.”

The article reads in part: “... with
unmistakable impact that could have
far-reaching effect in higher educa-

tion—Davidson College has inaugurat- .

ed a carefully planned program to rid
its campus of the ‘Gentleman’s C.’”
Who is anybody trying to kid? Does
Davidson College really believe the
Big Time Liberal Arts schools are
watching its Underachievement pro-
gram with anything more than con-
descending amusement? When _ the
Big Time admits a student, they do:so
knowing from a careful study of his
record that he can do the work in-
volved, and therefore they spend their
time, effort, and funds keeping him
motivated by improving the academic
curriculum, by bringing in outstanding
speakers and scholars-in-residence, by
purchasing books, and so forth.

The article also mentions ‘“Ac-
cepting the fact that the college can
predict what kind of record a man will
make at Davidson ....’’ We have

It is with a smal! amount of sur-
prise and a great deal of pleasure that
we welcome the proposed change of
format for the next Mid-Winters dance
weekend. .

The movement, which originated
with the Fraternity Presidents Coun-
cil, will devote all allocated IFC funds
to a single formal dance, to be off-
campus and featuring a big name band
and a vocalist—hopefully Julie Lon-
don. This is probably the first original
thought to pass the IFC in four years.

For those who have attended
eight or ten of Davidson’s “dance
weekends,” the same old routine of
concert, after-concert party and sleep
is becoming almost unbearable. He
seems so blissful because we have
only three such opportunities to blow
off steam. Even under-achievers need
to cut loose every now and then! Now
at last we have something different
to look forward to.

For many, the thought of a dance
weekend with only one IFC function—
at that a formal dance—is less than
pleasing. But, though we all hate to
admit it, there is usually simply too
much to do on a regular dance week-
end. After the rigors of an all-night

arty on Friday, we are unable to en-
joy Saturday’s fare. This new IFC

serious doubts about the infallibility of
a formula which claims to predict ac-
curately what a man’s grade point
average should be in college. Also, we
feel there is a decided danger that the
continued emphasis on penalties for
low grades will turn grade-conscious-
ness into grade-obsession.

The idea of using a mathematical
formula to rate a student’s efforts is
hardly in keeping with the liberal arts
concept of developing the “well-round-
ed man,” and so far the emphasis has
been almost entirely on the under-
achiever's being within the arbitrary
.5 of his projected grade point aver-
age

The best suggestion we've heard
is that anyone rated an “overachiever”
by the formula should be forced to go
out for football or some other time-
consuming extra-curricular and see
how long he continues to over-achieve.

A committee has been appointed
by the faculty to study “academic per-
formance in genera] at Davidson.”
Such is an excellent idea, and we hope
the committee will include three areas
in particular in its study.

First, we hope the committee will
investigate the possibilities of more
professor-student contact in forums,
etc. Among the best attended and
most beneficial events on campus in
our four years were the debates in-
volving Panel vs Uris vs. Audience-
in-general, and Patterson vs. Lewis, in
which professors took an active lead
in the discussion.

Secondly, the committee could
look into the odds on getting a foun-
dation to give a sizable grant to the
undet-everything college library.

And thirdly, speaking of academic
excellence, could the committee please
study classroom techniques. The Hu-
manities lectures and seminar courses
have met with much success, but some
courses here fall far short of a desir-
able level of intellectual stimulation.
Students cut these classes simply be-
cause sleeping in bed is more com-
fortable than sleeping in a chair.

We would like to see the college’s
interest in positive pursuit of true
academic excellence continued while
negative rewards are given the mini-
mum amount of necessary attention.

Meaning, for instance, that the
Alumni Bulletin could serve a much
higher puprose by explaining David-
son’s actual achievements in the aca-
demic field rather than printing cover
Stories flaunting the rather embarras-
sing fact that Davidson feels it needs
an Underachievement program. 7

proposal will leave much more room
for leisure time—something that
every dance weekend needs more of.

If Davidson is going to imitate the
Ivy League schools in the academic
field, it is only natural that we follow
a similar form as concerns social mat-
ters—especially big dance affairs. Call
it sophistication or whatever, there is
still something nice about a formal
dance with a big name band and vocal-
ist—if it’s done right.

And it looks as if the IFC is going
to do it right this time. The idea of
having said dance off-campus is an
excellent one. Somehow the thought
of waltzing one’s date across the cen-
ter-circles to the lovely music of the
Clemson “Jungleers” is just. not an
appealing one.

We certainly hope that this Mid-
Winters dance is predestined to be a
success, and that all the details can
be worked out. There will be, of
course, the reluctant core of “cool
guys” on the fraternity court who will
look with disdain and contempt upon
such a non-Weejun affair. But maybe
we should forget our insatiable desire
for lousy folk music just this once and
see what it’s like to have a dance on
a dance weekend.

Scripts 'n Pranks Shakily

Out Of Womb, Into The

BY BILL RUTH

The “out of the womd and in-
to the world” issue of Scripts
‘n Pranks was delivered at 7:31
p.m. Oct. 25 to a rather large
group of unexpectant young
ladies, while the proud father
dined on his fingernails and
@iluted his worries, just up the
road.

Father and child are doing
well despite an abortive croquet
match which father attempted
to nurture. The sdopted mothers
are also up and around, seeming
none the worse from their or-
deal.

The child, a boy we are told,
has toddled around campus for
two weeks now, displaying his
few talents, most of which we
find innate by nature rather

than acquired. He has the eyes
and mouth of nearly all of his
ancestors and the nose of a few
of them.

Although the magezine hes
few of the objectionable odors
of its parent (in fact it’s down-
right cleen), upon reading it
one wonders at times if it
might not need @ diaper
change; ¢f. “A Place to Get
Off’ by Jim Tanner. The
troubles of the world seem to
prove quite ea load for the
pretagonist.

The title “Dawn of Nothing”
seems also to be a bit sugges-
tive. In this rather precocious
display, young Charlie Vick toys
noisily with the “insight” attri-
dbuted to him by this 8’nP editor.
We would caution the proud
parent not to brag about his

exuberant children.

Li) S’nP, as he is called to his
face, is quite a serious minded
youngster. He rarely smiles,
never laughs and his feet seem
so insecure that he verily seems
to fly about campus. Not a
very robust youngster, he has
been seen whiling away hours
with a cat having a very char-
acteristic grin.

The question has been raised
as to what should be done with
this little urchin. Perhaps he
should be quietly drowned in an
Auld Mug. We think not...
the child resembles each of us
too much to warrant such in-
humanity.

indeed, he belongs to us all.
Eech of us shared in his con-
ception. If he laughs too little
end contemplates too much,

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Hall Answers Critics:
‘1 Have No Monopoly’

Ed. note: The following let-
ter from Cherlotte booking
agent Ted Hall is his answer
to Tim Kimrey’s editorial
(“The Big Haul’) and Rufus
Hallmark’s cartoon (“The Big
Hall”), which appeared in the
Oct. 4 DAVIDSONIAN.

Dear Editor:

Several of your fellow stud-
ents have sent me copies of your
editorial entitled “The Big Haul”
and the accompanying cartoon
entitled “Auction.”

I am flattered that you would
take of your valuable time to
build my modest efforts into
such a colossal “monopoly.” I
am afraid, however, that you
either did not have all the facts
or else sonie of the information
you have received has been dis-
torted.

First, let me hasten to assure
you that what little success I
have had in the booking business
has been earned through hard
work and a conecientious effort
to be of real service to the
fraternities and to the schools.
I have no monopoly. A look
through the yellow pages of
telephone directories in princi-
pal cities in this area: Charlotte,
Greensboro, Durham. Raleigh,
Columbia, ete. will show you
that there are many booking
agencies.

The simple truth is that the
majority of fraternities and col-
leges themselves come to me
because they know that not only
will they get absolute dependa-
ble service but that the price
will be reasonable.

lt is in the American tradi-
tion of free enterprise that a
man in any business succeeds
only when he gives honest
service and complete value for
the dollar spent.

we must bleme ourselves. it
is we that have meade him and
not he himself.

In his most cogent moments
he reflects our feelings: toward
a Puerto Rican from the Lower
East Side, a sergeant at summer
camp, loneliness on a bus,
pathos for the dead, love for a

girl . . . ourselves and each
other.
The mind of the child rambles

and repeats. The toddler lies and
he steals. He can often see no
end nor a beginning. He speaks
stupid, meaningless drivel at
times, But, then, don’t we all.

Perhaps such a serious maga-
zine can deliver us from the
womb of complacency into a
world in which life is not always
a bowl of cherries, but quite
often a bow) of pits.

In the case of :the Davidson
fraternities, I have had the
privilege of booking over 400
combos there during the past
twd and one-half years. Out of
this large number of bookings,
there were only two missouts
(sic) due to unavoidable circum-
stances that will occasionally
arise when you are dealing with
human beings. This means that
when a fraternity books with me,
there is hardly one chance out
of 200 that the miusicians will!
fail to show up. I do not believe
that this record can be beat
anywhere.

I also point out to you that
quantity booking of these com-
bos not only lowers the price,
Dut also improves the quality
of the combo. I do not hold
these combos by ‘“dall and
chain" as you depict. They come
to me because they know that I
am in a position to give them
more work than any other book-
ing office in this part of the
country, and I always pass this
advantage on to my clients. It
is, as you might say, like “buy-
ing something wholesale.” You
always get a better price.

College fraternities—from
Maryland to Florida, and west
to the Mississippi—have found
that they obtein better serv-
ice and at o lower price than
ean possibly be obtained else-
where. Thet is the only reason
why my business has flourish-
ed. You should comment me
for this schievement.

It is not for me to say whether
after-dance parties should or
should not be given. However,
since they are being given by
fraternities all over the country
and since they want live music,
I can only exert every effort to
furnish them with some and at
a price to come within their
budget.

T am sure that if you take the
trouble to canvas (sic) the var-
ious fraternities and to compare
the price they are paying today
with the price they paid a
couple of years ago, you will
find that there have been very
few increases in prices. Actual-
ly, we have been able to reduce
the prices on most of the groups
decrgise of volume booking.

Since your article was pub-
lished several weeks ago, I have
personally talked to each frater-
nity social chairman, and am
pleased to inform you that none
of them share in your opinions.

Actually, when you consider
the amount of time the social
chairmen will have to devote in
attempts to secure good combos,
plus the amount spent in long-
distance calls, etc., you will find
that actually they are saving
time, effort, and money in deal-
ing directly with my office.

As to my having contracts
with several restaurants and
clubs in the city of Charlotte,
this certainly is not true. In fact,
usually when I contact a particu-
lar place, it is done as a service
to the fraternity and not through
any financial consideration as
far as I am concerned.

As to the rents sky-rocket-
ing “during the last three
years,” | think that you will
find that rents generally have
increased in the lest three
years, This is due to a general
slight inflation and the high
cost of living. | am sure thet
your professor of economics
will bear me out in this. | do
not set the rental price that
any club or restaurant is ask-
ing.

{t stands to reason, that since
my business is booking orches-
tras and combos, I could not
make a booking unless a place
is available in which the party
could de given. Therefore, it
would be to my advantage to
help secure such places and at
the same time, keep the cost
down as low as possible. If I can
in any way assist the Inter-Fra-
ternity Council in trying to
secure more reasonable prices
from such clubs and restaurants,
I will gladly do so.

I hope that you will print this
letter in full so that, in the
American tradition, both sides
of this matter can be read by
your fellow students, many of
who (sic) are my friends.

BY RICK VON UNWERTH
Metropolitan Davidson comes into its own at nine

2X o'clock. When the lights dim and the lock turns on Ralph

Quackenbush’s ambitious, new-world Hub, Main Street
retires under a musty quilt of shadows—a patchwork of °
Faulkner, Dickens, and Horatio Alger.

Something new and modern is added every
year—the Bank and Insurance building first, then
the Hub, and this year P. Nicholls’ latter-day em-
porium. But Davidson's face refuses to be lifted, and
the long merchants row continues to exude an oddly
timeless personality after sundown.

Begin about nine at Withers Appliance store. There’s
a Sales Spree under way. The window offers an electric
toothbrush and a giant pumpkin, and a display of the
ultimate in water closet furniture stands just inside the

door.

The Wisteria Beauty Salon—now defunct—cowers
between two yawning doorways, the mouths of high-
ceilinged caverns full of old boarding and dust drifts. Any
of the three could probably boast of some lively commerce

in pre-Computer years.

The highly touted “Bonanza” three-bedroom home ‘is
yours for the asking at North Mecklenburg Realty. Just
pick your lot in a comfortable suburb.

On the other side of the partition W. S. Henderson
mends jewelry behind a Norman Rockwell portrait during
the days. There’s a fascinating wallful of ancient clocks
to help the time pass while you wait.

Then comes the rich-toned, imported, and
glamorous impeccability of Rush Wilson, Ltd., where
the stripes and tweeds make still. another round in

the cye

le of sophisticated haberdashery.

No dust or tarnish yet on the Bank, or on P. (Let us

know your needs) Nicholls;

only patronizing moonlight.

Past the Printing Company, the all-purpose Realty
establishment, and at nine-thirty McKissick’s shoe ma-
chines are still humming behind dusty blinds. The M&M
Soda Shop——Mary’s—next, with its empty window carpet-
ed with Casper and Archie comics and with faded copies
of Sepia and Bronze Thrills for the man who wants some-
thing a little more colorful than the standard magazine.
And Mother’s bread is only a dime at Cashion’s.

Next door the Western Auto window parades a
cheery storeful of absorbing toys for all ages. Marietta
Hat Shop, with a bead bedecked African mask, asserts
itself out of the hedge-lined shadows of two private door-
yards, and the College Restaurant promises good coffee
and oysters in season within.

Between two matching outdoor thermometers, each
proclaiming the chocolate-covered road to regularity, the
Hub shines bright as usual and a sign at the Ideal Cleaners
gives specifics for this week’s community barbecue.

Hood Norton's tonsorium and Copeland's jungle

round out the section between the orange and

blue

thermometers, the second of which reminds us that
a tin of relief can be purchased just inside at White's
Rexall Drugstore in the daytime.

In White’s, too, a listless, long-stemmed ceiling fan
swirls the musty air over a small collection of shopworn
books, ‘‘for sale cheap”, and Liz Taylor pouts “I’ve been
betrayed!” in a corner rack of assorted magazines.

The Garden Corner marks the end of the line, and
its Plate glass windows reflect the diffusion of red, green,
and yellow whose pattern alternates conscientiously to
marshal the phantom traffic of Davidson after hours.

Across the street the college church is cloaked in
amber shadows, and pale leaves drift softly against the
memory of the literary societies, quietly acknowledging

the autumn of Davidson.

NSA Serves Beneficial Role
With Aid For Campus Groups

BY JOHN SPRATT

__ In accordance with a petition presented to the student council, the student body
will have the opportunity to register its own opinion about membership in the Na-
tional Student Association. A referendum has been scheduled for Monday, Nov. 18.
But before that referendum is held, I think the student body should be adequately
informed about NSA. Otherwise the vote will be a toss-up over misconceptions.

No one has claimed that NSA
has been a dynamic force on the
Davidson campus, and no one
hes said that it is a panacea.
NSA has its limitations and par-
ticularly at Davidson.

Two summers ago when Dan-
ny Carrell and I attended the
National Student Congress, we
concluded that NSA could best
be used indirectly, that there
was no real reason to set up a
campus committee to implement
its ideas and push its platform.
There are already organizations
on campus which function
similar to the functioning of
formal NSA committees at other
colleges. The YMCA, the Round-
table Committee, the Interna-
tional Relations Club, the Con-
servative Club, even the literary
societies sponsor panels and
forums on social and political
issues.

It would only choke up the
extra-curricular program to
squeeze in another organization
to do the same thing half a doz-
en are already doing. So the
Student Council’s approach has
been to channel the resources
of NSA to other organizations,
and this is a major reason why
most know 50 little about NSA
as such.

Through NSA, for instance,
any organization can have ac
cess to Polback, a library of

background materials on politi-
cal topics. The Student Govern-
ment Information Service is al-
so available with studies con-
cerning student government.

Through NSA also, the student
council is a member of Educa-
tional Travel Incorporated. This
was put to use last year by
Dudley Salley in a YMCA for-
eign travel program and will be
used this year by John Carson
and a special committee on stud-
ent travel and study abroad.

Through NGA, the student
council offers to the Scripts ‘n
Pranks the opportunity to par-
ticipate in a national literary
review connected with the Sat.
urday Review.

This does not exhaust the
list of specific benefits, but
I think It establishes my point.
NSA can serve significantly
as a strictly supplementary
source.

All of this is obtained, more-
over, fer the price ef $30, the
total amount of our membership
dues to the National Student
Association. And for $30 we get
everything; there are no special
assessments. It costs more, of
course, to be represented at the
National Student Congress. If a
delegate stays the full two
weeks, it costs well over $100.
But this is far less than what

the campus publications spend
attending a convention which
lasts only a few days.

Probably the really controver-
sial fact about our membership
in NSA is not cost or benefit.
however; but rather, it is NSA’s
socio-political bent. It should be
clearly established that mem-
bership in NSA means, in this
respect, only one thing: that we
are willing to discuss.

It does not mean that we
agree with any of their publiciz-
ed policies, and the constitution
of NSA unambiguously asserts
this fact. It is a clearinghouse
for ideas, and no objecting mi-
nority must subscribe to or sup-
port the opinions of the majoz-
ity. If, in fact, the minority can
get sufficient support, NSA will
print its opinions also.

With Freeny’s argument that
social, economic, and political
issues do not apply to students,
I flatly disagree. What is more
applicable or pertinent for the
student than to relate his educa-
tion to contemporary issues?

As I said to begin with, NSA
is not a cure-all. I admit its
shortcomings and disagree with
many of its positions. But I also
realize that it is of positive
assistance in helping student
government try to do the job
it ought to do.
