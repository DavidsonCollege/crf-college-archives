Bruce Brown is outgoing SGA
President). I think he did a
damn good job, but that doesn’t
mean there aren’t things I
would do differently, because
there are.”

Among the things Jackson
would like to do is to explore
some.solutions to the registra-
tion problem. He sees the use of*
more afternoon classes in the
winter and 10 o’clock classes as
viable solutions to the problem.
‘‘Something was to be done
about registration, and it must
be done before we sign up for
classes this spring,”’ he com-
mented.

Jackson also said he favors
some changes in the athletic
program. He feels that the
” athletic budget must be item-
ized in order to let students and
faculty know what percentage
of it goes to each section of the
athletic program.

‘I think it’s absurd for a
school of this size to have a
‘secret budget,’ ”’ Jackson said.
More money allotted to minor
sports, women’s sports, and
student use physical education
and intramural competition—is
also favored by Jackson.

Housing shortages are also
among the issues he said he
intends to concentrate on.
“There’s no excuse at all for
people beirig forced to live three
to a room.” Jackson, a hall
counselor, said of this year’s
practice of housing some fresh-
men in triples. ‘‘Housing is a
problem, and the school should
investigate the possibility of
buying more off-campus hous-
ing.”

All of these issues, and other
related ones, Jackson said he

sees as growing out of one»
problem. ‘‘It’s time that David-°

son looked over its priorities
again as a college. It must first
of all be a college for people who
are here now. I think at times
the Trustees and Administra-
tion get too wrapped up in plan-
ning for the future. Davidson
has got to,get its priorities
straight, and it’s the SGA’s job
to get the students involved.”

Jackson said he feels that if
elected as SGA president he
would be in the position to move
the college community toward a
reevaluation of its priorities. He
said he sees the present as the
ideal time to do this.

The drug pairs— Darvon and

Tetracycline—were chosen as

in each case was: Darvon 50 »

percent more, Meprobate 83
percent more, Achromycin over
30 percent more.

In all, four other PIRGs at
colleges around the state have
completed similar surveys and
found similar results.

The press conference, held
last Tuesday, was covered by

“This spring will be crucial
for the SGA,” he said. ‘‘Many
crucial issues are coming up; all
of these things are right about
to burst. The SGA’s responsibi-
lity is to get the student body
together and get them behind
it. I have the energy for this and
the experience to go with it. If
we miss this opportunity,” he
added, ‘it won’t come along for
another five or ten years.’

Miller, like Jackson, is a
junior. He served this year as a
-senator in the SGA, and he said
he hopes to make this: organiza-
,\tion a more dynamic force on
campus if elected. ‘I think the
SGA really needs to be revital-
ized,” he said.

“We need to put in specific

directions, with organized
structure.”
Miller said he feels that under -

his leadership the SGA can be
revitalized through wider stu-
dent participation. “The basic
structures. are there, and stu-
dents do have power. They are
just as poserful a bloc as the
faculty, Administration, and
Trustees. We need to get organ-
ized and get moving.”’

He said he sees a major short-
coming in the fact that SGA
action is often a result of
campus controversy and not a
solution to or preventive of it.
“A big problem has been that
the SGA waits ’til problems
have arisen,’ Miller commen-
ted. ‘Students ate on all the
administration committees. We
need to coordinate, and antici-
pate these problems.”

_ Miller said he would also like
to use the presidency to up-
grade the SGA’s role as a
student service organization.
e said he feels services such as
fering rides to the airport
r exams and course evalua-
tions have been sporadic in the
pas and should be improved.

He also said he sees the
SGA’s image as a problem. “A
whole revitalization of the SGA
needs to take place because
students see it as a club,” he
said. He thinks this is due in
part to the organization actions
during the past few years.
“They meet but nothing posi-
tive comes out,’’ he added.

“We need to. get organized
now that many questions are
being brought up,” Miller says.
“Students have to make sure
they’re using their opportuni-
ties for influence.”

The PIRG members who par-
ticipated in the press conference
were hoping that it would raise
awareness of the savings con-
sumers could realize by pur-
chasing generic drugs as well as
support for the legislation.

At the conference Maria Pat-
terson pointed out that the drug
manufacturing companies were
the main body opposing the bill,
and emphasized that the bill
would aid consumers, and espe-
cially senior citizens who re-
quire daily medication.

‘titude of questions—

The presidential. candidates
will hole an open forum today at
10 a.m. on the patio of the
Union Snack Bar. Jackson and
Miller will be present to answer
questions and speak wjth stu-
dents.

Terry is running unopposed
for the office of SGA vice-presi-
dent. A sophomore, he also
served as an SGA senator this
year.

Although the duties of the
vice-president are not as con-
crete as those of the president,
Ti said he feels his job is

. “It’s an important posi-
tion,”’ he said. “I wouldn't be
running if I thought it was

simply an exercise in parliamen-
tary procedure. It’s much
more.”’

One of Terry’s duties will be
to preside over the Residence
Halls Council.: This council
deals mainly with dorm issues
—Code of Responsibility pro-
blems, vandalism, and storage
problems. Jackson revamped
the council this year while
vice-resident, and the next two
years ar designed to be a trial
period’ or the restructuring.
“His job will be important as
‘far as its existence goes,”
Jackson said of Terry’s respon-
sibility for the RHC.

This spring will also find
Terry doing a lot of what he
describes as ‘‘committee-hop-
ping.” “‘The vice-president has
been a morale-booster. and ice-
breaker in the past,’ he said.

‘Although that doesn’t
sound like much it’s pretty
important. Often it’s a matter
of the president not being able
to cover all the ground he wants
to. Mainly I have to be avail-
able,” he added.

As vice-president, Terry will

be more of a diplomat than a
policy-maker.” As far as my o-
pinion goes, I carry no more
weight than any other senator.
In that respect, it’s more impor-
tant that I lend sway to the
dictates of the President: and
the Senate,”’ he said. ‘“‘I certain-
ly will speak up, though,’’ he
explained.
- Terry said he sees one issue
which he and the other senators
will have to focus upon.”’ One
thing we’ve got to think. about
is whether our priorities are
straight as regards the aca-
demic excellence of the school,”’
he said. ‘‘That leads into a mul-
-sched-
uled exams, admissions, regis-
tration.’

Terry said he is looking
forward to working with the
new SGA president, whoever it
may be. ‘I think either Andy or
John would do a really good
job,” he said. “I know them
both, and I don’t think I'll have
any problem working with ei-
ther.”

“The PAC and I will be discussing the use of evaluation forms by
students, which is like any instrument. It has its drawbacks,”

Zimmermann commented.

At least the administration now has a more solid basis for

budget proposals came in, it
became apparent that we would

meet those needs.” As a result,
an 8.8 percent overall increase
was approved by the Trustees.

A breakdown of the increases

cost of living increases; a $60
increase in board, primarily to
cover rising heating oil costs; a
$15 increase in the laundry

figure was in excess of

$490,000.
