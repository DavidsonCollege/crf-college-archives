FROM THE EDITORS:

A Course of Action

The editors of the Davidsonian recognize the seriousness
of the current situation brought about by the faculty fratern-
ity committee recommendation.

In order that we all might form a more valid opinion on
the matter, it is indeed necessary to weigh the arguments
and opinions from all sides, for this is certainly no clear cut
issue.

It has been our aim in this paper to present a representa-
tive sample of views from all fraternities and from the ad-
ministration.

It is strongly urged that all interested parties—Faculty,
Administration, Students, Alumni and Trustees — read the
editorial page in its entirety and, in consideration of all the
facts, be more fully qualified to take a definite stand on the

matter.
Let us proceed with reason as well as emotion.

FROM THE PRESIDENT:

An Observation

We are now engaged within the College in an effort to
reach an important decision which concerns the entire com-
munity. The unsettled consideration has to do with Freshmen.
feeding in the Cafeteria of the College Union. Fraternity and
non-fraternity interests are involved. Faculty and Student re-
lations will display themselves. Trustees and Alumni both
now, and in the future, are to be considered. The social and
economic life of the College is a part of the entire picture-

Though the Fraternity Committee has made recommen-
dation, no final conclusions have been reached. Careful study
by duly appointed groups has been, and is being, made. The
practices and experiences of like institutions are being taken
into account. No hasty decisions will be satisfactory.

Here is an opportunity for the exercise of mutual under-
standing and confidence. The values of the fraternity system
to the institution are not in question. Their protection is es-
sential. The best interests of the entire student body is of
transcending concern. The over-all good of the College, both
now and in the future, is paramount.

We may now learn a far reaching lesson in group rela-
tions. It is the wisdom we look for in government, in manage-
ment-labor relations, in statecraft and in the Church. A sug-
gestion has been made to the various groups concerned that
representative committees be appointed to study, confer and
recommend. The hope entertained by us all is that in the end
a conclusion may be reached which will have the manifest
marks of wisdom and Christian spirit.

FRATERNITY COMMITTEE:

Two Considerations Given Why
Freshmen Should Eat At Union

Based on the following two considerations the Fraternity
Committee recommends that, beginning with the 1953-54 col-
lege year, all members of the Freshman Class be required to
eat together in the Cafeteria at the College Union Building:

1. The recognized need for a central dining facility at the
college and the belief that it should be self-supporting. To
operate such a dining room on a self-supporting basis will
require a regular boarding group considerably larger than
the group which would normally eat at the college cafeteria.

2. The conviction that such an arrangement will promote a
class unity and spirit which will be beneficial to the class
and to the college.

Certain benefits as well as certain problems will result
from such a program. Among the benefits are:

1. The College Union Fee, which will be added to the Student
Activities fee for 1953-54, will be considerably less for each
student if there is a profit instead of a loss in the cafeteria
operation.

2. Accommodations for fraternities and other groups can be
handled more efficiently and at lower costs to these groups
with the better personnel set-up and the more economical
operation possible under this arrangement.

. The College can make it possible for the fraternity board-
ing houses to buy a large part of their food requirements at
lower wholesale prices through a central purchasing ar-
rangement which will be handled by the manager of the
Cafeteria.

The College recognizes that it will be necessary for the:
fraternities to make certain adjustments in their plans for
food service as a result of the requirement that Freshmen eat
at the Union Cafeteria. It is prepared to cooperate fully with
the fraternities in making this transition as smooth as pos-
sible.

It is important that one point be recognized by all. The

Entered as second class matter at the Post Office at Davidson,
yeN. C., under the Act of March 3, 1897,

The issue of the day facing
every Davidson student was
exploded by the administrat-
tion in a meeting with frater-
nity presidents this past Mon-
day. The question is, in es-
sence, what would be the con-
sequences of requiring all
freshmen next year to eat
their meals in the soon-to-be-
opened College Union dining
hall. Our letters-to-the-editor
department got a sampling of
the general student attitude
in this week's mail and we
have inctuded herein excerpts
of letters from the various fra-
ternity representatives and
other interested parties.

CAMPUS CLUB

... I feel somewhat like the pro-
verbial Philistines among the He-
brews. The problems which con-
front the fraternities concerning
the boarding houses would not ap-

ly to the Campus Club, as we
Rave not maintained a boarding
house of our own since 1950. Yet
there are some aspects of the new
system that woild cause new pro-
blems for the Club, but perhaps
end a few old ones.

The assumption generally made
by the Interfraternity Council rep-
resentatives and fraternity presi-
dents is that the new system would

{necessitate postponed rushing. The

effects of such action on the fra
ternities would be immediately
felt in increased cost per man
for social functions, more and larg-
er assessments for operative ex-
penses, higher dues and increased
cost of board at fraternity run
houses. All but the last named
would also be true of the Campus
Club. As an organization that
stresses economy as a_by-word,
anything that would tend to in
crease cost per man is viewed with
alarm by the Club.

... I do not feel, however, that
all the effects will be detrimental,
either to the Campus Club or the
fraternities. The class spirit the
college hopes to inculcate in the
freshmen might eventually _ im-
prove the college and possibly re-
sult in a gain for all concerned.

Ed Blanton, President.

SIGMA CHI

... From observation of the ad-
ministration’s actions in the past
and examinations of the motives
for this action I am still uncertain
whether or not the original recom-
mendation will be passed by the
faculty. Students have responded
in the past with objections and
alternatives to proposed actions
detremental to student aims. We
can both, but I believe the
positive advantages the faculty
will find will outweight our argu-
ments.

Probable consequences of ac-
tion:

1. Reduce size of fraternities:
a. immediate reduction of % to
‘a

long-term reduction in upper-
classmen fraternity members
due to experience of 1 year
as independents, decreasing
activity of fraternities due to
finaneial loss. (A possible al-
ternative favored by some
faculty members is 100%
memberships in upper
classes.)

. smaller, closer-knit groups,
more “fraternity spirit,” less
activity.

. combination of boarding
houses.

e. possibility ‘o
body {

b.

division of stud-

ent into “fraternity
blocks” and _ independent
blocks in social and political
areas,

2. Set freshmen apart:
a. increase class spirit.
b. encourage hazing.

c. retard adaptation of freshmen
to college tradition and life,
growth by intimate contact
with older boys in fraternit-
es.

. .. Assuming this plan passes,
these, among other steps must be
insisted upon as compensation for.
the shifting of the financial bur-
den of the Union to the fraterni-

es:

1. College should guarantee not to
charge less than average of fra-
ternity board. Some system
must be devised.

Fraternities must be allowed to
serve independents where de-
sirable.

Independents should be exclud
ed from cafeteria to make it
strictly a freshman class pro-
ect.

a. Transfers should be allowed,
but not required, to eat in
cafeteria dbtring the first
year.

4. Buying plan advanced should be

seems lacking.

John LaMotte, President.
BETA THETA PI

. .. We have found, upon thor-
ough consideration of the recom-
mended change in Freshman din-
ing regulations, that, if the new
program is adopted, our fraternity
would be seriously affected in its
activities and practices. The initial
change would be financial. The
fixed costs of board per man

r month on the basis of 70 men
and 9 months is $11.59 out of
$45.00; a loss of 20 men would
necessitate a monthly increase of
$4.64 per man (minimum). This
does not include the added cost of
feeding a smaller number of men
(as fixed costs would remain the
same). For the same reason, we
would have to drop one out of 4
waiters, meaning a loss of $45.00
a month, or 00 a year, in
student aid per waiter.

From a scholastic viewpoint, we
feel that the chapter could not

watch over its pledges and aid them | },

to cultivate proper study habits.
Although nightly study halls could
still be enforced, we would have
little knowledge of their after-
noon or weekend activities until
grade deficiencies appeared.

Perhaps primary among our ob-|

jections to this program is that of
its. being a tremendous handicap
to the entire pledge training pro-

am. We feel that it is mostly
ust before, during, and after meal
time that we get to know our
pledges best, and thus are capable
of advising them on their pro-
blems and straightening out many
of their difficultics. The proposed
limitations on our contact with
freshmen would restrict this type
of training and thus the qualit:
of the fraternity brother, or
son Student, would be seriously
affected.

Furthermore, we would like to
point out that the . absence of
Freshmen brothers second semes-
ter would cause them to miss
many current activities, such as an-
nouncements, organization of
sports, etc, which fact would have
a tremendous demoralizing effect
on the fraternity spirit as a whole.

PHI GAMMA DELTA

... At the time of the Union
construction and planning means
for financing the proposed cafeter-
ia system must certainly have been
considered. Why is it now: sudden-
ly sprung upon us without an:
warning or consultation? .. .
the present system was decided
upon, fraternities should have
been notified then!

Our objections to the present
proposal is that a resulting drop in

raternity membership is inevit-| |

able . . . this would ruin board-
ing ‘houses. Also rent on lodges
would ruin fraternities if they be-
come smaller and the rent remains
the same... If the administration
has made a mistake why should
fraternities be made to pay for it?

It seems one of the school’s
main arguments is a weak cheer
for the resulting increase of school
spirit .-. . I say school unity will
be hurt. Freshmen will not know
seniors. Freshmen will eat with
friends anyway, form blocks, and
will pledge a fraternity in groups
ing ere will be more late pledg-
before. This isn’t unity . . . Fresh-
men should have the right to
choose their own eating place.

This might be a bit extreme, but
it’s entirely possible: fraternities
could become merely rich men’s
clubs. This would lead to much
adverse criticism and even fra-
ternity wars ... The least we can
hope for is that the plan will not
further destroy fraternal unity to
the extent that the present set-up
(which we consider excellent) is
destroyed.

If they need financial aid we
suggest .. . raising College Union
fees... keep a small staff: let
fraternities provide help for spec-
ial occasions . . . charge a nomin-
al fee to social fraternities for use
of ballroom and facilities when
acting as a group... sell the auto-
matic curtain puller (to be used
in 1967) to help defray expenses.

If class unity is the problem,
have class dances, banquets, part:
ies, intramurals, and competition
... Wwe never noticed this lack of
unity.

$14.00. This leaves 47 eating at the
boarding house.

Thus, to meet expenses, board
would heve to be raised a minim
um amount of $5.00 ($14.00 less
$9.00). This would raise our boar
from $45.00 per month to $50.00.

Under proposed Central Food
Purchasing Agency, what percent-
age of saving would it require to
offset the estimated $5.00 per man
increase in cost of operation due
to the decrease in number of
boarders?

If all variable expenses could be
channeled through the agency a
10% discount could possibly o fset
the loss of boarders; however, not

all of our variable expenses are
food stuffs and also wh highly
improbable that we could satis-

factorily buy 100% through the
agency. Therefore, my estimate is
that a 15% discount through a
central purchase agency could off-
set our financial loss. This is a
very conservative estimate.

The above figures are to the
best of my knowledge correct and
the estimates are figured without

jas.
PHI DELTA THETA BOARDING
HOUSE, Fletcher Bright.

The purchasing agency re-
fered to by Fletcher was pro-
posed by the administration in

nday’s meeting. It was
their plan that all fraternities
would buy from one school
sponsored agency and thus,
because of the quantity in-
volved, afford each fraternity
a reduction in buying cost.—

SIGMA ALPHA EPSILON

... This proposal, as outlined by
the faculty committee, if adopted
would present the fraternitics and
the student body with several pro-
lems. The most acute of these,|
but probably the one which could
be most easily solved, is that of
financial adjustment which could
be accomplished through combina-
tion. This in itself has certain dis-
advantages, but would enable the
fraternities to maintain operations
of boarding facilities. The other
problem is on the social side, and

feel would have a much greater
and more lasting effect upon the
fraternity system and the person-
ality of the student body as a

whole.

I think that everyone will agree
that the large majority of a man's
fraternity. experience centers in
the boarding houses. Because of
the obsence of the freshmen, they
would be deprived of the benefit
of the close association with u
perclassmen which is fostered in
the boarding houses. The upper-
classmen would not have an op-
portunity to as closely observe,
correct, and encourage the fresh-
men in their adjustment to colle:
ife, and I am afraid that this
would greatly hinder their assimi-
lation into the student body. This
would also make the pledge train-
‘ing programs and criticisms inef-
fective.

After serving on the Court of
Control it is my opinion that the
fraternities in their pledge train-
ing and corrective programs have
a much greater effect on the per-
sonality and character of the fresh-
man class than does the Court.
The effectiveness of the fraterni-
ties along this line would be great-
ly decreased if the proposal were
adopted, and I do hot believe that

their present effectiveness. As an
eventual result I can forsee the
possibility that the quality of the
so called “Davidson Gentleman”
could be lost. .

I do not feel that this is the time
for a general uprising against the
administration nor that we should
debate and argue merely for the
sake of argument. Nor do I think
that we should seek to strengthen
or prevent the weakening of the
fraternity system on the campus.
Rather, I feel that we should think
in terms of long run results and
the effect that such a move would
have on Davidson five or ten years
from now. With this in mind we
should strive for a stronger and
better Davidson, eyen at the ex-

e proposal will result in a
stronger. and better Davidson.

Alpha Tau Omega is concerned
for the finances of the Student
Union because it is a wonderful
facility, but we are also concerned
with our own finances. We have

the number necessany for practic-
al qcberation at the present stand-

We stand either to be penalized
by having to pay a drasti

now which is high enough; a great-
er charge would be a burden many
could not bear, and our numbers
would be even further reduced.
Giving up the house would mean
the sale of equipment at the usual
loss of money. ‘Also there is the
loss of jobs to 15 persons each
of whom depends greatly on fra-
ternity jobs.

But in addition to matters of
money and jobs the loss of that
house would mean the loss of a
great part of the fraternity’s ident-
ty, the loss of a common enter-
prise which brings its members to-
gether more often thin any other

the fraternity would be reduced to

superfluous to state here the dis-

us in the fraternity system. Even
the alternative of combination

with other fraternities would mean
a greater loss than just the loss of
money and jobs for us.

We would not piace our frater-'

are set up at Davidson are not a

. . . Our fraternities were limit-
ed a few years back to merely eat-
ing and meeting together, but
through a coordinated intra-m
program and two social functions
a year they still were able to re-
tain the intangible spirit and value
of the fraternity idea.

Now the freshmen are to be re-
moved from the boarding houses.
We see two inevitable conclusions:
first, there will be a reduction
in the number of annual fraternity
pledges; second, reduction
will make boarding house rates

rohibitive for remaining mem-

ers.

The College Union is a perfect
fraternity house. It boasts more
magazines than anyone could read
in two months; coffee on tap,
doughnuts, Cokes; an extensive
record collection; game room;
comfortable furniture; television;
musical facilities; and theater at-
tractions. In short, it adds to ex-
isting fraternity advantages many
features which the administration
would not allow a fraternity to

uild.

It is questionable whether the
College Union can add adequate
and just athletic and social op-

rtunities to fill the needs of the

evitable increase in non-fratern-
ity men. It is certain that not
enough class spirit and unity can
be generated ugh the propos:
ed plan to provide the individual
counselling, companionship and
development that accompany the
earning of a fraternity pin.

The proposed freshman board-

we shall find the camel all the
way in the tent. I op the in-

. .. There is now no doubt in
anyone's mind but that the exist-
ing conditions have necessitated
some sort of change and also that
all the reasons tendered to sub-
stantiate alternate changes are at
best speculations. With these facts
in mind I believe that a better
plan would require the freshmen
to eat together for one semester
and would entail an increased pro-
rata second-semester Union fee in
order to realize the balance of po-
tential cafeteria revenue. Under
this proposal class spirit, it seems
to me, would be manifested in two
ways: first, ugh the semester
spent eating together; and second-
ly, through a program to be initi-
ated this Spring by the Y. M. C. A.
This program which encompasses
class functions and projects is a
proposed stepping stone to future
successful class activity. If class
spirit still fails to appear in any
appreciable degree, then the sup-
plementary idea of freshmen
dorms merits consideration.

Let me say quite frankly that
I can see shortcomings in this
proposal as I can in each suggested
remedy. The question has resolved
itself into another question: Which
series of disadvantages would be
most advantageous for both Ad-

ministration and fraternities? In b

the Administration's proposal I be-
lieve there are several awesome
possibilities which could tend tor
ward the eventual decline of the
fraternity system. I have no doubt
that membership will be reduced.
¢ this reduced membership takes
away the friendly rivalry; if it
heightens the minimum exclusive-
ness and cliquishness; or if in any
way it detracts from Davidson's
present individuality of system,
then | feel the plan is bad. While
the financial is could perhaps
be weathered in a desperate and
barren three-year period, the more
important cumulative series of un-
derlying possibilities could wreck
the whole system.

Let me close now with a seem-
ing about face. I believe that the

conviction and unquestionable in-|—— the potenti

tegrity of the Administration and

fraternity committee lends weight|SPite from the books.

to their proposal. I recognize that
the entire college f ly (which
includes students) shares a mutual
aim and that is to better Davidson.
And so it seems to me that the
thing to do is to recognize the
situation, to analyze and evaluate
the plans, to attempt to anticipate
the possible pitfalls, some of which
approach monstrous proportions,
and then to work together in ef-
fecting those decisions.

to continue independent existence.
Due to the resulting cut in our
boarding membership, we will be
forced to close our bo: § house
or have them close down to jo
us.
In either case, we will put five
people out of jobs and deprive a
student of his room. Both frater.
nities will lose all that an inde-
endent boarding house means to
ternity fellowship and spirit.
Both will suffer in attempting ef-
fective pledge training. Both must
expect a definite lack in use of
the fraternity house | by freshman
pledges they may have.

The boardin house is an institu-
tion within the unique Davidson
fraternity system. However, the
freshman is to have no part of it.
Fraternity life could h be
for the Davidson student before
his sophomore year. I think it is
commonly that we wish
to prevent a loss of one year of
fraternity life by the Davidson
man (such as by withholding rush-
ing for one year).

The freshman will find that in

iKA.| most cases the major use of the

houses results directly
from going to and coming from
boarding house meals via the frat
house. But the boarding house is
not for him! Where else then will
pledge-brother fellowship exist,
since the location of hman
meals will provide no en route
stops at the frat house?

It would appear that the de-
trimental consequences of running
a college dining hall are being
transferred to the fraternity sys-
em.
Several questions come to our
minds concerning the overall plan:

the administration feels

in forcing (sometimes
expressed as “re-
quiring”) men of the n
class to dine in a specified loca-
tion, do we have absolute assur-
ance that such a mandatory policy

2. How does this program justify
the consequent idleness of our

3. Is the administration confi-
dent that the contributors to the

used to create such a _ serious

fraternity life?

4. If this plan has been in mind
for considerable time, why is it

sultation with, or warning to, fra

take the form of an ultimatum?

Mitchell Patton, President.

These nofes make it plain:
the Davidson A je
cloistered by his own choice
from the commerce and crisis
of society, has been presented
with a different sort of ques-

ion.

It is ostensibly an emotional one

loss of his least

nsive and most enjoyable re-

» as well

as, the intangible meaning of “fra-

ternity” can not however be put

down on paper. Even if it were, it

would be accorded adolescent im-
pulsiveness.

More important and more perte-
nent, it is a question of econom-
ics. Here the question exceeds our
cloisters and calls for considera-
tion as sober and ludgement as
mature as any we shall achieve
after graduation.

From you who have slready
graduated — Faculty, Trus-
