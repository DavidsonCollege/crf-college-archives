At the request of the Nat-
ional headquarters of the Am-
erican Association of Univer-
sity Professors (AAUP), the
Davidson chapter of the
AAUP appointed two com-
mittees on Monday to compile
information on the history of
the religious requirement for
tenure at Davidson.

Professor of history Mal-
colm Lester, President of
the Davidson Chapter of
AAUP, appointed the two
committees, which will pro-
vide the National headquar-

ters with three items:

1) A document of the his-
tory of Davidson’s religious
requirement for tenure and
how it has evolved through
time,

2) A narrative account of
the Linden case, entailing a
factual, chronological compi-
lation of the day-by-day se-
quence of events and _corres-
pondences surrounding Lin-
den’s appointment to the pol-
itical science department and
the subsequent withdrawal of
the college’s offer to Linden.

3) A statement from the
Davidson Chapter regarding
its position on the question of

Task Force tackles Tenure

By KEVIN WHITE
Staff Writer

Davidson’s Christian Ten-
ure Policy has been the direct
concern of the newly created
Student-Faculty Task Force
on the Religious Requirements
for Tenure.

Prepare for Trustees

For the past two weeks this
SGA-based committee has or-
iginated and conducted all
actions dealing with the con-
troversial tenure policy. Its
actions have included an or-
ganized letter writing cam-
paign last week to iliarize
Davidson’s Trustees with the
presentscontroversy as a pre-
liminary to their tri-annual
meeting to be held this week.

It sponsored a community
meeting Monday night to
discuss the controversy.

It has written and distribu-
ted a petition calling for a
reevaluation and change in the
present tenure policy.

The task force has «also
prepared a case statement,
approved unanimously by the
SGA, to be read to the
Trustees this week. Specifical-
ly, the statement finds the
religious requirements for ten-
ure at Davidson objectionable
on three main arguments.

The statement argues that
the present policy is objection-
able because it confuses the
issue of Christian commitment
with Christian tenure. David-
son’s Christian commitment is

Ceasing publication

With this issue The David-
gonian ceases publication for
1976-77 school year. Pub-
lication will resume September

, 1977, for the 1977-78 year.
Davidsonian extends

1977 and wishes everyone

not-an_issue...‘‘we affirm the
moral principles promulgated
in the Statement of Purpose...
The goal of an academic
institution is to provide the
best possible education for its
students. This means that it
should seek not only the best

minds available but those
persons who exemplify the

love of truth, respect for
human dignity and unselfish
desire to serve... It is clear
that (these values) can be
embraced by both Christian
and non-Christian...”
Secondly, the present policy
is ‘‘unwise from an academic
point of view.’’ In light of
recent publicity in that it can
only serve to erode ‘‘David-
son’s standing within the aca-
demic community.’’ Several
candidates for employment
have recently withdrawn their

applications upon learning of-

the college’s tenure policy.

Lastly, the case statement
finds the present tenure policy
objectionable on ‘‘religious
grounds’’. It states that “the
current exclusive hiring policy
seems inconsistent with the
Christian virtues of love and
toleration...’’

formed to ‘‘look to the well-
being of people teaching at
graduate and , undergraduate
institutions,’’ according to
Donald L. Kimmel, Chairman
of the biology department and
last year’s Chapter President
for the AAUP.

In 1940, the National
AAUP established guidelines
fox tenure policy. Schools ac-
ross the country then publicly
announced their individual in-
tentions to grant tenure either

in accordance with these,

guidelines, or based on the
school’s private policy.

The AAUP requested the
formation of these “‘fact-find-

ing’’ committees to provide

the organization with back-
ground material on the Linden
case, said Kimmel.

Joseph E. Schwartz, Assoc-
iate General Secretary of the
AAUP, said last Friday. that
“the inquiry is very informal
at this point. We’re at the
stage of listen and learn.”

Schwartz explained that, in
inquiries of this type, the
AAUP “‘looks at the printed
word first and then supple-
ments it with recollections of
those involved.”

“We get the facts and then
assess them against our stan-
dards,” Schwartz continued.
“If we determine there is a
problem existing, we bring
that assessment to the admin-
istration with our facts and
ask them to comment.”

Finally, according to
Schwartz, the AAUP ‘‘makes
a recommendation to the ad-
ministration’ which ‘‘hope-
fully leads to a resolution of

one kind or another.”

Board plans Code

By PHILIP D. DUNCAN
News Editor

The Media Board elected
sophomore Greg Hankins as
its chairman and- finalized
plans to draw up a Code of
Responsible Journalism for all
stuident media at its meeting
this week.

Hankins appointed junior
Bert Downs, sophomore Tom
Bessellieu, and Admissions
Counselor Leonard Satter-
white to draw up the code.

This subcommittee will refer
to documents from other
schools who have media
boards similar to Davidson’s
and will report to the Media
Board in its next meeting on
Tuesday.

Hankins confirmed that the
Board will present a state-

ment, includirg the Coda. t-

the College’s Board of Trus-

tees at their October meeting:

The Board discussed its
relationship with the Publica-
tions Board, the WDAV
Board of Control (which is
presently considering the spe-
cifics of a proposal to expand
the radio station), and also
considered its role in determi-
ning the budgets of the stu-
dent media.

These and other matters will
be considered in the future.

Graduating senior Matthew
Covington is the only current
Board member who will not
return to serve next year.

In addition to Hankins,
Downs, Bessellieu, and Sat-
Robert A. Currie, Director of
News and Photography Earl
W. “Buck’’ Lawrimore, Dean
of Students Will Terry, and
Professor of Germa> Julius 8.
Winkler serve on the Board.

Dr. Amelia Dockery is
moving to France for two
years, Dr. Meredith Hall is
not returning next year and
Dr. W. Gatewood Workman is
retiring.

“We're going to try our. best
to have coverage five days a
week,’’ said Terry.

This year the counselors
cover only four days, but an
outside evaluating team des-
cribed the available counseling
time as adequate forthe
number of students at David-
son.

Terry plans to hire at least
two and hopefully three coun-
selors so that students will
have the opportunity to chose
the counselor with whom they
can most effectively work.
These counselors will alternate
hours as Dockery, Hall and
Workman do this year.

The College has only $16000
allocated for psychological
counselors, so Terry is forced
to hire either members of the
college community or counse-
lors from Charlotte if he plans
to hire more than one psycho-
logist . Terry says this rest-
ricts the market from which he
can choose, and makes the
hiring process more difficult.

At present he is inter-
srisaring members of ¢ os *=—-
selling team from Charlotte,

each of whom will work part

tinge at Davidson.

“There is a strong possiblity
that we will have greater
access to a psychiatrist for
referrals, an occasional visit or
the prescribing of drugs,’’ he
said.

He does not want the
psychiatrist to have specific
days on which he will be on
campus because of the possibi-
lity of studerits labeling this
day as the time for ‘‘real
crazies’’ to receive help. In-
stead.he hopes the psychia-
trist will be available in emer-
gencies or on campus periodi-
cally.

Terry emphasizes the need
for a team concept for the
counseling center, where he
hopes the counselors will work
closely together. He also
hopes to initiate ‘groups dev-
eloped by the counseling staff
which could provide preventa-
tive measures for the stu-
dents,”’ he said.

' Although he has definite
ideas of how he would like to
see the counseling center func-
tion, Terry does not want to
“control the style or content of
counseling sessions between
individuals.

“My ultimate concern is to
