THIRTEEN DAVIDSON MEN TO
GRADUATE FROM SEMINARY.

There are 13 Davidson men who will
finish their work at Union Theological
Seminary, Richmond, Va., this spring
and go out to their ministry, namely,
James L. Fowle, ’18, Washington, N. C,
who has held the Moses Hoge Fellow-
ship of Graduate Study during the year,
and the following members of the Sen-
ior class:

T. R. Alexander, '19, Matthews, N. C.
E. G. Clary, ’16, China Grove, N. C.

R. W. Cousar, '18, Bishopville, S. C.
A. R. Craig, ’17, Pendleton, S. C.

W. M. Currie, ’19, Carthage, N. C.

. K. Fleming, ’19, Barber, N. C.
Fraser, '18, Hinesville, Ga.
Hamilton, '17, Atlanta, Ga.
Mann, ’17, Mebane, N. C.

. M. McBryde, '16, Red Springs, N. C.
. E. McClure, ’20, Wilmington, N. C.
C W. Worth, ’20, Wilmington, N. C.

There are 112 students at the seminary
this year, a record attendance for our
church. Thirty-four of them are vol-
unteers for the foreign field, and 17 of
the 34, that is just half, are from David-
son College. In view of the recent an-
nouncement that the financial condition
of the Committee of Foreign Missions
at Nashville will probably make it im-
possible to send out any new mission-
aries during the present year, these 34
volunteers“have published an appeal to
the Church, and it is earnestly hoped
that there will be such a’response to it
as will make it possible to send out with-

out delay all the volunteers who are
" ready.

Dr. James I Vance, the chairman of
the Assembly’s Committee of Foreign
Missions, has been elected to deliver the
James Sprunt ‘Lectures at the seminary
rext session. The lecturer on this foun-
dation this session was Hon. Wm. J.
Bryan, and the volume containing his
lecturers has just appeared from the
presses of Fleming H. Revell Co. It
bears the title “In His Image,” and it is
a volume of marked interest to all col-
lege men. Dr. Vance’s subject will be
“The Preacher and His Message.” Ten
volumes of these lecturers have been
published in the ten years since Dr.
James Sprunt established the lecture-
ship. One of these is a fascinating work
entitled “Keynote Studies in Keynote
Books ‘of the Bible” by a distinguished
graduate of Davidson, Dr. C. Alphonso
Smith, ’84, now head of the department
of English in the United States Naval
Academy at Annapolis.

The Home Mission Messenger, of West
Hanover Presbytery, speaking of the 13
summer workers employed in. the bounds
of that Presbytery last year, refers in
terms of warm’ commendation to the
Sunday School Institutes conducted by
Mr. E. H. Hamilton, ’17, and Mr. Geo. C.
Bellingrath, '18, students at Union Sem-
inary. The addresses they made on
Foreign Missions, illustrated with ex-
ceptionally fine steropticon views, were
unusually informing and_ impressive.
The article goes on to say that the Pres-
bytery has secured two other young men
from the seminary to undertake a sim-
iiar work next summer, namely, Mr. L.
B. Schenck, ’21, of North Carolina and
Mr. D. C. Shaw, ’21, of South Carolina.

Mr. James was graduated from David-

He took post-graduate work after his
graduation and also acted as superin-
tendent of the public schools of David-
son the following year. After attend-

remarkable. During his administration

with conditions 50 years ago. He also
discussed the diplomatic relations be-

then received.

Saturday Night.

After receiving reports of the activities
of the various bands of the state, the
delegation from Meredith College pre-
sented a missionary drama entitled the
Two Masters. The splendid acting of
the 10 actors well taught that it is im-
possible to serve God and Mammon and
was also an appeal for foreign mission-
ary work,

The day was concluded with a real
enjoyable informal reception in the Y.
W. C. A. hut.

Sunday Morning.

Dr. C. W. Hooper, of Richmond, Va.,
taking his text from Heb, 11:10, urged
that each person diligently search for
God’s purpose for his life, and, having
found it, to direct his energies toward

*|the accomplishment of that purpose.

The delegates then attended the morn-
ing services of the various churches of
the city.

Sunday Afternoon.

Four foreigners, from their first-hand
information, earnestly plead for our aid
and prayers. Miss S. K. Sung, of China,

cially.“ Mr. Lynn, of Korea, who has
toured practically the whole world, gave
an interesting account of the needs of
Korea. Then Mme. Villedien gave the
needs of Egypt, where she has labored
for a number of years.

Dr. R. H. Bennett, of Nashville, Tenn.,
uniquely told of the worthwhileness of
the abundant Christian life. He stated
that there is nothing mysterious about
being a Christian worker and urged that
all strive to find their true calling.

The question box, which had been open
for questions throughout the convention,
was opened and the questions were read.
Helpful discussions of them followed.

Sunday Night.

Many of the Volunteers spoke before
the various young people’s’ societies of
the city. Those who remained at the
college attended the Y. W. C. A. vesper
service. The speaker, Mr. Bland Roberts,
gave a masterful talk on making Christ
real. 5

The closing session, conducted by Mr.
Roberts, was turned over to receiving
testimonies as to what the conference
had meant to individuals and what they
expected it to mean to their band. Sey-
eral told just why they had decided to
become foreign missionaries. At the
close of this session, which proved to be
the climax of the conference, several
volunteered.

In General.

The singing was one of the most help-
ful parts of the convention. The Gos-
pel singer, Mr. D. L. Manessa, by his
calm leadership added lasting smiles and
pleasure to the singing.

In the front of the Adelphian Society
hall, where most of the sessions were
held, the watchword of the Volunteers,
“The Evangelization of the World in
This Generation,” was printed on,a large
cloth twenty by two feet. The badges
worn by the Volunteers were also im-

reese. They bore the words, “Christ

¢ Chaos—Which?”

HAMILTON HOLT TO SPEAK

visited all the battlefronts of the Allied
Armies as the official guest of the vari-
ous governments. During this tour he
was decorated by the King of Greece
and made an officer of the Order of
George I. When the League of Nations
was being drafted, Mr. Holt was in
Peris, and Colonel House appointed him
laison officer between the American
Delegation and the League to enforce
peace. During this time he was deco-
rated by the French Republic and made
an officer. of the Order of Public In-
struction, and Chevalier of Legion of
Honor, and by the King of Italy an of-
ficer of the Order of the Crown of Italy.
Later Mr. Holt toured the United States
with Mr. Taft and others, speaking in
favor of the League of Nations. In 1920
Mr. Holt again visited England, France
and Germany and has kept in close
touch with affairs in our own country
and abroad. He has been in attendance
on the Conference on the Limitation of
Armaments and any exposition he may
make concerning America and the world
will be based entirely on the gleanings

he has, gathered from the activities of

inner circles.
Mr. Holt, A.B., LL.D., Litt.D., has writ-

ten two books that in themselves reveal

the greatness of the man, “Undistin-
guished Americans” and “Commercialism
and Journalism.”

It is indeed an honor and a privilege
for thg students of Davidson to be able
to hear a discussion by a man of such
note on a subject of such importance.
There is not a man at Davidson who-in
the last few years has not heard or read
of Hamilton Holt, and it is with a great
deal of pleasure and expectation that
we welcome him to Davidson.
