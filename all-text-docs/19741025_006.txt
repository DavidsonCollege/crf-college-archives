Cranks raises the question of
what rights may be withheld from
citizens of the United States while at-
tending a private college such as
Davidson.

The State of North Carolina, in

granting a charter to Davidson
College, recognizes that education is

a public function, even when per-'

formed by a private institution.

College President Samuel R. Spen-
cer Jr. made this point in a speech
delivered to the Board of Governors
and University Trustees in Chapel
Hill, North Carolina on September 19,
1974.

There he said, ‘‘. . .the distinction
between private and public is valid
only in reference to control, not at all
in reference to function. Func-
tionally, the colleges and universities
of both groups are public institutions.
The private institutions are chartered

As we feel that the college press is a :

vital part of the educational process,
at Davidson College as an avenue for
expression of information and ideas,
we feel that student journalists must
be guaranteed the protection and
rights of the First Amendment to the
Constitution of the United States.

In censoring the yearbook, denying
students of Davidson College their
constitutional rights of freedom of ex-
pression, we feel that the ad-
ministration of Davidson College is
violating the trust of the State of
North Carolina as a chartered private
institution performing a public ser-;
vice.

Laundry Whitewash —

It is the opinion of College Business
Manager Robert A. Currie, Comp-
troller Robert W. Davidson and Laun-
dry Manager Frances Beaver that
the college laundry cannot be
operated on a voluntary basis.

We encourage the administration to
study further the question of com-
pulsory laundry fees and services, in-
vestigate the possibilities of running
the laundry on a voluntary basis, and
publish answers based on a bit more
than opinions and guesses.

Last year’s Student Government
Association referendum indicated
that 92 percent of all students voting
favored some use of the laundry.
Beaver indicated that the laundry is
busier now than ever before, and an 8
to 10 percent. decrease in the work
load might come as‘a blessing. Fur-
ther, 90 percent of the student body

should be able to support the\

operation financially, particularly if\
the nine employees who next year will

be past retirement age were allowed
toretire: — ;

Certainly the students who do not
wish to pay the $130 per year fee to
depend on someone else to wash their
clothes would enjoy considerable

savings. We agree with Beaver that
“students are getting their money’s
worth” for the services provided.

However, many students would be,

able to save in the neighborhood of
$100 next year by doing their own
clothes in coin-operated machines--
which are making rather than losing
money for the college.

We quite frankly resent Beaver’s
assertion that the honor code will not
work in regard to the college laundry.
We simply don’t notice large numbers
of students here leaving due to honor
code violations, and we have: no
reason to suspect that they are going
to be willing to risk expulsion by using
their roommates’ laundry numbers.
The attitude is disturbing to those
who believe the honor code works
because of faith at every level, no‘
because of fear instilled througl
paranoia.

All along students have. been
reassured that the collee’s actions
have been in their best interests; the
laundry has been stressed in its

capacity as a student service. We

cannot ignore the irony in the
phenomenon of a ‘‘compulsory ser-

vice.”’

We feel that the alternative of an
optional laundry offers pune for
students, the laundry and the college.
We would be particularly distressed
should this option be rejected after
irresponsible investigation subject to
mere ‘‘feeling’’ and ‘‘opinion.”’

Hattie’s Provides
Leisurely Escape

If it’s Thursday night, then
this must be Hattie’s.

It is a curious experience,
really. But somehow. when I
am here I feel a strange inex-
plicable, almost metaphysical
unity among all of us.

Now it is entirely possible
that this feeling of closeness is
in some degree due to the fact
that the music is so loud and
the smoke so thick that one
practically has to get intimate
to be able to see and hear his
partner in dialogue.

And of course some credit,
must be given to _ the
physiological effects of all the
smoke and all the liquid
refreshment.

There is a relaxed at-

mosphere that really begins to
‘approximate the friendly

small college spirit that the

‘admissions office likes to

boast about. If those prep
Still I think that Hattie’s
performs a singularly unique
function in making life here
bearable week after week.
The observation is often
made that Davidson College
can and will really destroy
‘This is usually attributed to
some mysterious combination
of grade pressures, deadlines,
competition and the peculiar
social structure that
produces in the average
Davidson student (if there
exists such a creature--
perhaps at some later date

‘ someone will attempt to define

the ‘‘Davidson mind-set’’), an
inner pressure from which he
must find release or be
psychologically destroyed.
Now I’m not foolish enough
to suggest that getting drunk
several times weekly is either
a healthy release, or the only
thing holding some of us
together.
But I do believe that anyone
interested jn the psychological
well-being of students here
should take a look at the spirit
of community offered here.

wonder what a year of life
