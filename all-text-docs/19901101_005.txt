Think Before You Vote

Watching garbage T.V. in that
dead hour between classes and
dinner, I noticed a fascinating
similarity between all the political
advertisements. Although repre-
senting a multi-faceted candidate,
each focused entirely on one issue.

One spot supporting Senator
Jesse Helms in his campaign
against newcomer Harvey Gantt
accused Gantt of running two
campaigns, one public and one
private. According to the ads, the

“secretcampaign has solicited funds
from out of state voters, specifi-
cally gay out of state voters. Pic-
tures of newspaper clippings and
dollar figures flashed across the
screen to demonstrate Gantt’s na-
tionwide support from homosexu-
als.

Thecommercialisa deliberate
manipulation of public sensibili-
ties. It says nothing about what
Jesse Helms stands for, but only
that Harvey Gantt is “too liberal
for North Carolina.” It focuses on
one issue, homosexual rights, and
nothing else:

In another Helms advertise-
menta Duke University Professor
of Education endorses the senator.
He implies that the only reason he
is voting for Jesse Helms is the
incumbent's stand on education.

Gantt supporters also are not
innocent of such one dimensional
decision making. Two Davidson
women ‘who'asked. fo remain an-
onymous told:me ‘that although
they normally: voted Republican;
they ‘aré: votirig: for'Gafitt solely *

Single issue voting can be

Eric Bone, ’91, feels that “a
candidate who is the kind I want in
office has more than one issue in
common with me.” In regard to
Jesse Helms, he added, “TI object to

As voters and future leaders
of our country, we need to closely
examineeach candidate as a whole.
Only by doing so can we control at
all whathappens in the legislature.

National Organization for Women,

I Want My S.D.E. (Seven Days for Exams)

A few weeks ago the Faculty
Executive Committee (a.k.a. the
F.E.C.) passed the 1992-1993 cal-
endar. A great deal of talk, and
dare I say -- dissention -- has

Golly, what a great bunch of
guys (and gals) they must be. The
really ironic, and in fact funny thing
though, is these aren’t even “‘com-
promises, ”’ These changes are noth-

of the student body.

You may ponder, why all the
hullah-bahoo? Will we hedonists
who call ourselves students ever
learn the value of a good education
unless we’re made to suffer? Why
must we beso unreasonable? After
all, the F.E.C. has been very gra-
cious in actually considering stu-
dent input, whereas before they
simply ignored it.

And just look at all the won-
derful “compromises” they have
made on our behalf! They “added”’
days to our Fall and Thanksgiving
Breaks, they “extended” our Chris-
tams Break, and they even moved
Spring Break out of February and
actually into the spring!!

hanges. back to

But the main compromise the
F.E.C. wants from us is our sanity,
to be surrendered after we blindly
flounder through a five-day exam
period. Yes, that’s right boys and

girls, a five-day exam period! But

Status quo. Yet we’re supposed to
believe these concessions are com-
promises.

Why, in the last meeting in
fact, one Senator even remarked,
and I paraphrase “it has always
been a faculty decision and it’s es-
sentially up to them.” Although I
agree that it’s “up to them’, I still
hold to the belief that without stu-
dents there would be no need for
teachers, and they are thus directly

responsible to the needs of the .

students. ee

I’m not calling for student re-
bellions or anarchy, but compro-
mise, real compromise. Teachers,
listen to the needs of the students,
please!

wait, there’s more, if you act now,
you’ll also get your Reading Day
taken away at no extra charge!! A
veritable bargain!

Seriously though, the Secre-
tary of the F.E.C., Dr. Nelson, told
Lori Rockett, Chancellor of the
S.G.A., that if organized student
dissaproval was exhibited the
F.E.C, may reconsider the calen-
dar. And because I have an inkling
that some amount of student dis-
sent, however miniscule, is pres-
ent, I have taken it upon myself to

organize-a petition, because per-"

sonally, I would rather reside eter-
nally in Dante’s lowest ring of hell
than suffer the consequences of a
five-day exam period.

But how will you undertake
such.a great responsibility as this,
you, the reader, may ask? And ask
you may, for now I am about.to
reveal my fiendish plan to the
campus at large, which will be

carried out’ by the great under-—

ground network of dissenting
Davdisonians. A copy of the peti-
tion, which looks like this:

In signing my name, I assert
the following:

The 1992-1993 calendar is not
just and fair because:

1) The Fall Reading Day was
essentially stricken,

2) Five exam days, especially
consecutively as within the Fall
plan, is not sufficient to take all my
exams,

3) The examination procedure
should stay status quo.

The petition will be harbored
by one member from every hall on
which Freshmen or Sophomores

dwell. As.voters and future leaders
of our country, we need to closely
examine each candidate as a whole.

This person will be respon-
sible to present the other members
of his/her hall with the petition,
and then possibly elicit a signa-
ture.

I will then write a report of my
findings (which will I believe
support my hypothesis thatthere.is
notone student, whom most would
consider sane, who wants a five-
day exam period) and give it, and
the petitions, to Dr. Nelsonand the
EE:

If you would like to help in this
greatest of tasks and do yourself
and your classmates a most gra-
cious favor, call me (-6117), and I
will give you a petition for you to
gather the. zealous: signatures. of
your halimates. I needalotofhelp,
so please, don’t be shy, and give
me a call!
