“The Light of the World is Jesus.”
He referred to the many beliefs and
concepts in different parts of the

world today as to what is the true

light of the world.. “Each nation
thinks,” he said, “that they have
the true light in their national
religion or ideology. We can not be
too sure that we have the true
light unless or untif~6urs is an
active following of Christ and not
simply an heriditary acceptance or
a mere mental assent. We cannot

see the Christian light by. basking or

reclining in the reflected rays.
Relief from darkness is promised
only to those who are active fol-
lowers of the true light of the
world.”
