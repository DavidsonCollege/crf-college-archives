“Don't crowd, gentlemen! ‘Dr. Mathe-
son’ will see you all before he stops.”

Yes, that’s what they are saying up at
the front door of Rumple, the entrance
through which the distinguished “Doc-
tor” goes each morning to hold his con-
sultations with people from all over the
country. All you have to bring is a dol-
lar and an honest face, and all of your
tuture will be put before you by the
noted spiritualist, Dr. Matheson,
Dopey Jones.

Dr. Dope has a Divining Cup which he
uses to tell his customers their whole
future. Last Tuesday he told the eminent
Mr, Buffalo McKinnon his whole future,
and three of the prophecies have already

for his testimony. Only one week ago
this gentleman went to consult with Dr.
During the consultation Dr.
Dopey told Mr. Appleby that he would
have to do only three small things and
pay an extra fee of 37 cents, and that he
would be able to gain as much flesh as
as he pleased. The money was paid,
and Mr. Appleby himself will tell you
that he has gained 11 pounds in seven
days.

The redoubtable Hippo the Brown’ and
Ed Houck, Esq., declare that there
can none be found who can in any way
measure up to the noted character who
has just discovered that he is able to
tell anyone anything that he’ wishes to
know. Besides the testimony of these
two men, many others, too numerous to
mention, have been received by Dr.
Matheson’s secretary, Mr. Bevo Davis.

of his associates a Noah Count, made

Dr. Dopey told Mr. Count that if he
would play nine holes of golf on a Friday
night, the 13th, in the dark of the moon,
with a black cat under each arm, lead-

three balls that he would be entirely

CHINESE POSSESS GREAT
INTELLECTUAL FACULTIES

The morning service at the Présbyte-
rian Church last Sunday was conducted
hy Dr. Robert F .Fitch, president of the
Hangchow Christian College, in China.
The nature of the service was a sermon)
on missionary work in: China, with spe-|

Dr. Fitch related an interesting inci- |

Exchanges

An article appearing in The Red and
Black, the University of Georgia publi-
cation, seems to infer that there is great
dissatisfaction with the honor system:in
many schools. Quite a few universities
are considering abandoning the idea as
impractical. But the article also states
that there is no dissatisfaction among
University of Georgia students, only oc-
casional murmurings arising from among
the members of that student body, as

would arise among any group of. stu-,
dents.

Ambition
There are two kinds of ambition, One
personal, peevish, fretful, pessimistic; |

always pouring forth its tide of com-
plaints—the other a mountain of restless
cnergy, a spur to help the weaker to suc-
cess—the latter is denominated a noble
ambition. The incarnation of a helpful
optimism, it constitutes one of the noblest
attributes of man. It prompts him to rise
into a higher realm and to assert his
claim to the noblest work of God. It is
a spirit which no adversity can daunt
and which no misfortune can destroy,
which is strengthened by reverses, and
which rises from the mire, to rebuild a
brighter and stronger structure upon:the
ruins of every shattered hope.

Let us scorn a life of inglorious ease.
We are called to do something better.
Life is not a gift to be spent in sleep or
squandered in the mazes of the dance. It
is a deed of trust; and it calls us to bat-
tle and to toil. Nature herself proclaims
the motto which should govern and con-
trol our lives.

he was somewhat startled by this re-| tions of an acceptable husband. Twenty-

mark from his newly-made friend:

“T should think that your work asa
missionary would carry with it a certain
feeling of condencension, and that the
Chinese would look upon you with a
degree of resentment.”

After inquiring of him his business Dr.
Fitch learned hat he was an oil man
who had been to China, selling them
kerosene, so that they might substitute
for their crude lighting methods, a real
oil lamp. Then in a beautiful illustration
the speaker compared the work of the
missionary, the one who takes with him
the spiritual light of the Living God, to
replace the terrible superstition that
is prevalent throughout China; with the
work of the man who takes with him, the
oil for better lighting Purposes.

“There has always been a feeling -in
America,” continued the speaker, “that
the Chinese are a people of a marked de-
gree of intellectual inferiority to the
American people, but I was thoroughly
convinced of the fallibility of this belief
ten years ago. The Chinese have had
their great men and are capable of
achieving greatness through intellectual
processes even as the Americans are.”
