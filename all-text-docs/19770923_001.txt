Seeks student input

White guides admissions’ effort

By MEREDITH DEAN

For the rest of the Davidson
communtiy the year has barely be-
gun, yet a quick glance in the
admissions office assures us that
plans for next year’s Freshman Class
are already in progress.

Applications from high school se-
niors eager to join Davidson’s ranks
are coming in every day and Satur-
days are rapidly being filled with
prospective student tours and inter-
views.

However, handling admissions en-
tails much more than merely proces-
sing application, and Dean of Admis-
sions and Financial Aid H. Edmunds
White, was glad to comment on the
many aspects of the job.

Student input

One vital area of the admissions
program is student input. Presently,
student involvement is basically vo-
lunteer oriented and depends on
students who are willing to contact
prospective applicants from their
home areas.

Some of this contact is planned, but
more often it occurs spontaneously on

the part of an interested Davidson
student.

White was quick to point out the
lists posted outside the admissions
offices which include the names: of
present Davidson students, prospec-
tive students, and in the spring,
newly accepted students. Many upper
classmen see familiar names or zip
codes on these lists and volunteer to
contact people, guide visitor’s tours
or even keep prospects as overnight
guests.

‘Advertise’ Davidson

The newly accepted Freshman is
also encouraged to ‘‘advertise’’ by
telling juniors in his high school about
Davidson and its opportunities.

As long as Davidson’s student
body continues to be reponsible and
enthusiastic, White feels that an

organized, structured program for
student recruiters is unnecessary.

Another area of admissions which
relies heavily upon personal contact is
that of minority student recruitment.
This year’s Freshman class contains
fourteen minority students, which is a
step forward from recent years.

Minority situation “not ideal”

‘‘Although there are many more
qualified minority applicants now
than perhaps five years ago and
Davidson’s reputation is definitely a
drawing point, the College does not
offer an ideal situation for a minority
student,” White said.

In order to encourage more appli-
cants, the admissions department has
made it possible for application fees to
be waived in some instances. \

Davidson has also been arranged for

some of the minority prospects who
might otherwise be unable to see

school.

Although these steps are being
taken, White stressed the importance
of volunteers to make personal con-
tacts in this area.

When asked about Davidson’s cur-
rent policy concerning the ratio of
men to women, White seemed to favor
a more balanced situation. However,
White feels that a merit-based, sex-
blind admissions procedure could lead
to an “imbalance in either direction
which might prove unattractive to
both prospective students as well as
those currently enrolled.”

Controversy also surrounds ths

THE CHAMBERS BELL will ring again—the SGA this week
asked Director of the Physical Plant Grover C. Meetze, Jr., to
repair the bell atop Chambers building which in past years has
signalled the changing of classes at Davidson.

OFTEN IN the past the bell’s mechanical action, controlled by a
sensitive electronic timing device, has been sabotaged and put
out of commission. Meetze declares that, ‘‘Philip Cashion
[Supervisor of Engineering Maintenance] has assured me that
he can repair it.”’ [Gregg Strader]

The Patterson Court Rules
Subcommittee is considering
the issue of the eating house
selection process and will re-
port to the Advisory Council
on Campus and Religious Life
by next Monday.

Several students offered
comments last Monday when
the subcommittee solicited op-
inions on the issue at an Open
End.

Numerous members of some
of Davidson’s national frater-
nities spoke in favor of estab-
lishing a selection process that
would enable the fraternities a
greater degree of control over
the selection of new members
to their groups.

Prestigious scholars aim to
emulate Stuart’s character

By LYMAN COLLINS

“Ed Stuart had very admir-
able qualities and everything
he did, he did well as far as
athletics, leadership, music—
you name the area, and he was
outstandéng,’’ said Stuart
Scholarship recipient Ray Cra-
ven.

“If I can follow in footsteps
like that I think it’s a worth-
while goal and I would like
very much to uphold the tra-
ditions that he stood for,” he
continued.

Craven and fellow Stuart
Scholar David Waddill are the
top recipients of the initial
grants made by the Edward
Crosland Stuart Scholarship
Program. i

There has been some contro-
versy over the Program, the
largest scholarships Davidson

offers based strictly on merit,
because it has been limited to
students with a strong Christ-
ian commitment.

Davidson College President
Samuel R. Spencer, Jr. ex-
plained that the Stuart family
had placed this restriction on
the program.

“Itis Mr: and Mrs. Stuart’s
desire to recreate and as far as

possible to duplicate the kind

of person their son was,”
Spencer said, ‘‘and they can-
not see him apart from the
kind of faith which motivated
Craven and Waddill dis-
cussed this and other impres-
sions they have of their initial
Davidson Experience.
‘*Davidson is a whole new
xperience,”’ explained
raven, “‘and the people here
are very friendly.”

Waddill, a pre-law student
said that Davidson’s good
reputation among law profes-
sors at Wake Forest Law
School helped influence him to
come here.

. CRAVEN
‘‘I’d heard a lot of good
things about Davidson; every-
body gave it a real good
report.”

[see STUART, page 3]

Most of these people seemed
in general agreement with the
principles of the ‘“‘Anders Pro-
posal’’, which was drafted last
year by a fraternity member.
Under that proposal, the fall
term open houses, which ac-
quaint the freshmen with all
the Court organizations,
would be continued.

Bid or self-select

At a specific date early in
winter term, freshmen would
place their names on either a
‘fraternity bid’’ list or a
‘‘self-selection’’ list. The frat-
ernities would make a special
effort to meet those in the
bidding list, then would simul-
taneously issue written bids to
those on that list.

The fraternities would bid
until the bidding pool was
empty, or until their houses
were filled to capacity. If any
students remained on the bid
list due to lack of space, in the
houses, their names would go
to the end of the self-selection
list.

Then the self-selection pro-
cess would be conducted as it
has been in recent years, with
students sitting in rows in
Love Auditorium, called by
their row to sign at the eating
house of their choice.

Inequity in system

The fraternity members pre-
sent said that the Anders
proposal or one similar in
intent would allow’ the
fraternities to have a voice in
determining the character of
their groups. They claimed
that there is a basic inequity in
the eating club self-selection
process, which the college says
offers students freedom of
choice.

They maintain that it is the

dom of choice, that beyond the
freshman year none of the
upperclassmen on the Court
have any official power to
determine the character of the
house at which they eat and
socialize.

The fraternities want some
selection process that will
impress upon the freshman the
fact that joining a fraternity
and joining an eating club are
two altogether different com-
mitments.

The fraternity men said that
they try to work within th
current rules of the self-selec-
tion system, but a few, admit-
ted that at least somone the
fraternities extend oral en-

‘couragements to prospective

members and indirectly dis-
courage those whom they do

p not want.

Process discri iminates

The fraternity men empha-
sized that because the Court is
overcrowded, the self-selection
process often discriminates a-
gainst men who have decided
that they want to sign up with
one particular fraternity.

If these “firmly committed”
get a bad draw when rows are
called during self-selection,
the fraternity they really wan-
ted to select into might be
filled by the time their turn
comes. And, to make matters
worse, some of those who have
taken the places at the frater-
nity may not be particularly
interested in the fraternity
itself, but rather are only
looking for a place to eat.

Other students at the meet-
ing wondered if the planned
new Commons would not re-
lieve the overcrowding on the
