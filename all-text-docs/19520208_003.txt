Two Davidsonians
have slipped into the na-
tional ‘“‘sportlight”’
without much notice
from the outside world.
These two rugged in-
' dividuals grabbed the
limelight as a result of
their activities on the
gtidiron last fall, and
were chosen within their
respective fraternities to
the honor of being
named on the frater-
. nity’s all - American

team.
It was announced
By DIOK LILES this week that Dick
Perkins of Marion, Va., and a defensive center on Coach Crowell
Little’s Wildcat squad of 1951, had been named honorable men-
tion on the “All-ATO, All-American” football team at the
center position. “‘Perk’’ was named along with Tom Stevens at
Carolina who has copped the honor for first-team mention for
three consecutive years, and other notables such as Bob Sherman
of Georgia Tech and a tackle, Julius Wittman, the captain of
the squad and a three-time winner at tackle from Ohio State,
and Tom Fillion, fullback on the Kentucky Wildcats team.
Perkins transferred to Davidson from Emory U. and has another
year of eligibility as a Junior.

WADE GETS MENTION AS KAPPA SIGMA
STANDOUT

Somewhat earlier, the magazine of Kappa Sigma came out
with its annual All-American team and the honorable mention
list carried the name of the 51 Wildcat’s first team fullback and
later halfback, Ham Wade, who is a brother in the local Kappa
Sig Chapter. Ham played consistently well the entire season and
was one of the few boys that did not sustain an injury during
the year. (Quite an accomplishment, considering.)

CLOSE GAMES ARE NEMESIS

Did you ever stop to think about the number of close games
that the Wildcat Hoopsters have played and lost in the last two
years? You probably remember the ones last year and the fre-
quency that they came about. You also will remember the last
home game in which the Generals of Washington and Lee
marched off. the floor after a stormy closing minute with a four-
point lead, being presented said lead by the generous officials with
two, two-point free throws in the last seconds. I've never been
able to get that one straight.

All in all there were five (5) games besides the WUL fray
that were won by the opposition by less than three points. Prob-
ably the most thrilling was the Maryland game where at the
sound of the whistle (or a fraction before), a tow-headed Irish-
man flipped a midcourt basket in and left the floor with a 57-55
lead for the victory. Right up close to the top were the two
games with Carolina. Both were won by three points and were
responsible for carrying on the jinx that the “boys in baby blue”’
have over the Red and Black. Scores were 69-72 and_ 53-56.

South Carolina also ran into the Wildcat Den (where the
majority of these heartbreakers take place) and squeezed by with
a 74-71 win. It was Don Cox and not Slaughter that ruined
us this time. McCrary Eagles also slipped by the local hoopsters
by a 73-71 score in the latter part of the season.

PRESENT CROP TAKES THE CAKE

So far this year has been the proverbial ‘‘straw,”’ though.
The Tas Heels again did it, but this time they were on their
own court and squeezed in a foul shot to make it 78-77 over
the Cats. The other night was the apex, it seems to me, because
we had outplayed the Deacons all through the game and com-
pletely bottled up young Hemric, but came out on the poor end
of a 64-63 score. .

As usual the fans were both shocked and sad over the out-
come. The reason for these losses is not anything you can put
your hand on, but I was just bringing attention to the already-
thrown-about fact that Davidson has lost more than its share of
the close ones, and its about time that the ball bounced our

way for a change.

CATS HIT TIGERS TONIGET,
TRAVEL TO STATE TOMORROW

By BOB OWENS

The win-hungry Cats of Coach Boyd Baird will definitely
be looking for a berth in the Southern Conference Tournament
when they meet the Clemson Tigers tonight on the local Johns-
ton Gym floor because they then travel to Raleigh to meet the
potent N. C. State Wolfpack on Saturday night.

Tonight’s game marks the second
meeting of the two teams this sea-
son. In a game played last week
the Tigers managed to trip the
Wildcats to the tune of 67-49, with
Richardson and Sneed leading the
way. The local netters have been
working hard on defense to stop
these lads as they did Wake
Forest's Dickie Hemric in Tuesday
night’s game. The Wolfpack of
N. C. State set down the Wildcats
74-48 early in the season, but all in-
dications point to a much closer
game Saturday night, The mighty
Wolfpack has found the going
rough.with intersectional opponents
and were recently handed their first
Southern Conference defeat by Wil-
liam and Mary's Indians.

In other conference action
since exams were completed,
Furman, led by Frank Selvy
and Neill Gordon with 27 and
24 points respectively, rocked
the Wildcats 98-69. The Wake
Forest Deacons barely nosed
out the Cats 64-63 in a game

Wildcat Of The Week

played on the local gym floor
Tuesday night. Although they
got off to a slow start after
the exam period, the Cats
seemed to have definitely hit
their stride in the Wake Forest
contest, hitting on 32 per cent
of their shots from the floor.
Let this be a warning to the
Tigs who invade Presbyterian
Hollow, Friday night. The Cats
have been very successful in
entertaining foes on their home
court and they would like noth-
ing better than to add Clem-
son to their list.

Everyone will agree that the stu-
dent body is 100 per cent behind
the Wildcats—any Wake Forest
fan would be glad to verify this
statement. With the high moral ot
the team and its followers and the
confidence. that Coach Baird puts
in the boys, the remainder of the
schedule should be a nightmare for
Opposing teams.

When the Davidson College
Swimmers invade the campus of
Washington and Lee Saturday aft-
ernoon for a swimming meet, it will
be one of the few times this sea-
son that the Catfish haven’t been
the underdogs. While the meet
won't be exactly a breather it will
be a rest after having met such
conference stalwarts as N. C.
State and Carolina, both having
terrific teams this season.

Freshman standout Alex Ormond
in the 220, 440 and 150 individual
medley events holds future promise
in the coming seasons he has re-
maining as a Catfish. Other top
stars for the Cats are Aubrey Miree
and Bob Patten in the dash events,
Jim Bryan in the backstroke, Cap-
tain Ken Taylor in the sprints, and
Sam Myrick and Paul Cole in the
distance swims.

Wednesday afternoon the Catfish
got back on the winning side with a
victory over the University of
South Carolina by a score of 46-38.
It was the second victory of the
season for the Catfish, both over
South Carolina. Jim Bryan showed
much improvement by dashing a
pool record in the backstroke event.

With a record of two wins and
three losses the splashers will be
aiming at hitting the five hundred
mark in their meet with Washing-
ton and Lee on Saturday and the
results should be in favor of Coach
Redding’s men.

del on the Johnston Gym mats, The
injured Cat regulars are Morley
Vail and Nabbie Armfield who will
be out of action, possibly for the
rest of the season, with chest in-
juries.

Coach Parker’s lineup for tomor-
row night’s tissle, which includes
two newcomers — Don Reid and
Angus Andrews, is expected to be
as follows:

123 Ib. class—Bobby Joe Key.
130 tb. class—Gene Craven.
137 Ib. class—Don Reed.

147 Ib. class—Johnny Guiton.,
157 Ib. class—Angus Andrews.
167 Ib, class—John Buxton.
177 1b. class——Bill McElveen.

Heavyweight—Stoey Bailey or Bill
McNeely,

The Red and Black grapplers are
out to put another win on their
1951-52 season's record. Their lone
triumph to date came at the ex.
pense of the Emory University
squad on January !2 in Atlanta.

After tomorrow’s battle the Da-
vidsonians have meets left with
VPI on February 16, and a final
contest on February 22 with the
Washington and Lee wrestlers.
The VPI encounter will be at the
Johnston Gym while the W&L
match will find the Cats traveling
to Lexington for the season’s
finale,

GENE CRAVEN

By MOODY SMITH

In these days when Davidson | Southern Conference tournament.

seems to be taking more than its
fair share of hard knocks, in the
world of sports, at least, its en-
couraging to find a Wildcat ath-
lete who can not only hold his
own against the competition but
who stands, figuratively at least,
head and shoulders over mos:
available opponents.

Such a man is wrestling team
Captain Gene Craven, who is
proving himself to be one of
the outstanding matmen to per-
form in the local gym for quite
a while.

Since coming to Davidson in
‘50, Gene has lost only two matches
in dual match competition. As a
freshman he went undefeated dur-
ing the entire seascn, and so far
this season he has yet to come out
second best, having beaten wrest-
lers from Carolina, Emory, State,
and Duke.

Last season he suffered his only
two regular season defeats which
came at the hands of the Univer.
sity of Virginia and VMI. In tour-
nament competition Gene won the
Carolinas AAU meet in the 128
pound class, and coming down to
123, he took a third place in the

Craven is nearly as out-
standing in his other college
activites as he is on the mat.
Gene is the first junior to cap-
tain a Davidson wrestling squad
in 17 years, A pre-ministerial
stutent, Gene also maintains a
B.plus average, is a member
of the Student Council and of
Phi Delta Theta social frater-

nity.

As to Gene's future possibilities,
wrestling coach Charlie Parker is
more than optimistic. Parker
thinks that Craven stands an ex-
cellent chance of becoming the
Southern Conference champ in the
130-pound category. »

Craven will also be a leading
candidate for honors when the
AAU meet comes along the last of
this month. He also plans to enter
the Olympic tryouts later on in
March and if he has the least luck,
will probably do as well as last year
in both.

All of which speaks pretty well,
to say the least, for 5’ 6”, 20-year-
old Gene who had never wrestled
before in his life until he came to
Davidson College.

Davidson's Johnston Gymnasium
will be the site of two nationally
important sports events this spring.
The Southeastern United States
Olympic wrestling tryouts will be
held here March 14.15, and the
Carolinas’ AAU = Championship
wrestling tournament is set to take
place February 29 and March 1.

The Olympic tryouts here will be
the only ones held in the Eastern
U. S. south of Princeton, N. J.
Unlike collegiate bouts, the Olym-
pic tryouts will be 15-minute af-
fairs with International Wrestling
rules utilized. Under these rules
candidates for Olympics positions
will be climinated by a much more
thorough, although more time-con-
suming, system.

Winners in the District 5 com.
petition will be qualified to compete
in the final Olympic tryouts for
the 1952 team. Eight weight dj-
visions have been listed for these
tests ranging from 114.5 pounds to
unlimited.

This is the second year in a row
that the AAU tournament has been
at Davidson, the award being made

We know as well as he there’s only one fair way to

test cigarette mildness. Andmillionsofsmokersagree!

It’s the sensible test...the 30-Day Camel
Mildness Test, which simply asks you to try Camels
as your steady smoke, on a day-after-day,
pack-after-pack basis. No snap judgments. Once
you’ve tried Camels for 30 days in your “T-Zone”
