Union Board sponsors fair

Taking advantage of that special big weekend atmdsphere, the
Union Board will launch the First Annual Spring Frolics Crafts
Fair this Saturday.

The fair is scheduled to last from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. on the
Chambers front lawn and will include work by Davidson students
and outside artists from across the Carolinas.

‘The Crafts Fair is a way the Union hopes to include both social
and cultural programing into big weekends instead of just having a
big social scene,’' said Union Co-curricular Vice-President Amanda
Hall.

“It also gives the students a chance to either exhibit their work,
or to buy someone else’s,”’ she continued.

Every imaginable art form including glass-blowing and
calligraphy will be on display. Music and rides also will be offered.

Some of the artists include Jason Noble exhibiting his paintings
and prints; Ron Chapple with his photographs; Margaret Miles,
jewelry; Rusk Scholar Liz Woodham-Smith, sculpture; Gifford
Piercy, drawings and sculpture; John Christian, pottery; and
Ginny Newell, prints and pottery.

The fair will offer ‘‘some painless art education,”’ according to
Union Board President Mary Jo Clark.

Council on Campus and Religious Life resulted in a run-off. The
run-off for the two seats was held today, but results were not

know why. I feel very safe.”

Simon Adam Curtis, also
from Putney, is undecided
which university to attend and
when to go, but he hopes to
study English literature and
drama. He concentrated on
English literature, history, and
economics at St. Paul’s.

At Davidson, he is taking
Drama 21 and ‘‘reluctantly’’
Problems of Philosophy. He felt
the Rusk scholars were ‘‘left in a
lurch’’ as far as course selection.

Curtis has visited New York
City before and he feels, ‘‘It is
illuminating to see another part
of America, because I did feel
all America was like New York
City. The first day I came here I
was shocked. It looked like only
one building.”’

But Curtis added, ‘‘Every-
thing has been made easy for
us here and we've always had
something to do.”’

Curtis commented, ‘‘The Ho-
nor Code seems to relieve a lot
of the pressure you get at
universities.”

Curtis eats at PAX and plays
on their softball team. He said,
“We had a terrible defeat the
time I playea. It was great
fun—I got a softball in the
shin.’’. He doe? like the eating
house system waich he termed
“homey.”’

Elizabeth Wopdham-Smith is
from Chelsea, London. She was
“Head Girl,” or president, of
her and she studies
English literature, art and art
history, and history. She will
attend Saint Hilda's College,
Oxford University this fall to
study English Language and
literature.

let, and enjoys theatre, film,and
visual arts. She is also working
of lighting for the drama pro-
duction.

Eating at Rusk, she finds it
‘quite cozy with very good
food, but I would have preferred
to be in a coed, larger house so I
could meet more people.’’

Woodham-Smith finds Da-
vidson students ‘preoccupied
with their own goals and they
don’t seem to be very aware of
what’s going on in the world.”’

Sian Roberts, from Englefield
Green, Surrey, near London,
will probably attend Durham
University in northern England
next year for studies in geo-
graphy.

Here at Davidson, she’s ta-
king Edible Wild Plants, Inter-
national Politics, and The U.S.
Since 1921, which she’s “‘enjoy-
ing a lot.”

She’s taking Mountaineering
I, Canoeing I, clogging class,
and she swims before
breakfast.

Although she ‘‘likes parties,
she feels she doesn’t know that
many people yet.

She commented, ‘It’s nice to
be in an eating house. Food is
one “of my main interests,
puddings (desserts) especially.
People are nice. They teach me
how to get extra dessert.”

Roberts is ‘‘passionatley
Welsh" and very interested in
Welsh culture.

About Davidson, she said,
‘I’m enjoying it. It hs its ups
and downs. Everything we get
to do has to be on campus,
though because we can’t get off
campus.”

She's interested in travelling
through the U.S. and she'd
‘“‘love to see a desert and a
grizzly bear.”’

cialized in geography, Greek,
and Latin at St. Paul’s School.
Next year, he will be attending
Keble College at Oxford Univer-
sity to study geography.

Here he is taking English
Literature Since 1832 and so-
phomore level Humanities.

Although he feels there is a
‘‘mixing of academic stan-
dards,’’ Keen commented,
“Teachers I’ve enéountered are
generally good.”’

Of Humes he said, ‘‘The
Syllabus is extremely interest-
ing, but it’s a bit too superfi-
cial.” :

Keen is eating at F&M this
term. ‘‘I’m making some good
friends.”

He has done a radio show and
worked for ARA Slater Food
Services at the banquet for
Senator Charles Goodell.

Keen likes theatre, films, and
music. “I play the guitar and
piano a bit,. and I worship
people like Dylan, Neil Young,
Springsteen and The Clash,”’ he
said.

Keen said he loves the setting
of the College, but “It was a
great relief to get away to the
mountains last weekend. I don't
think ! could stand four years in
a place like this. I like the
bustling city.”’

“I find students here some-
what naive in their relations to
ideological issues. A bit middle
class apathetic. Project Peace
has very poor response, I
expected more of that sort of
thing,” said Keen.

“T've learned what affluence
means here. It's a bit too
affluent here for me,’’ com-
mented Keen. He said, ‘‘I have
socialist sympathies, but I’m
not sure which system is best.
It’s an important question I
haven't answered yet.”’
