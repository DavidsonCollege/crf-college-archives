Minorities, from page 1

Race was not considered a real issue
for Davidson.”

Murphy, who spoke first, sup-
ported the view of Davidson as a
school that in the 1960s was sepa-
rated from the racial changes occur-
ring in the country.

When he entered the college in
1966, he was one of only two black
students and found it difficult to ad-
just to the differences from his all-
black community in Charlotte.

“T did not expect any professor to
tell me that I could not take their
class,” Murphy said. “I did not ex-
pect a patronizing attitude from any-
one. I did not expect to be alienated.
I was.”

Although Murphy initially
struggled to meet the academic de-
mands at Davidson, he sought help
and support from professors and
eventually decided to stay.

“T only had one goal, and the goal
was to get educated,” Murphy said.
“Everything else was extra. I could
not room with any other black stu-
dent that was here. It was not thought
of as a good idea to let us room to-
gether. There were times when I was
on campus for a month, two months,
and I did not see any other black stu-
dents.”

Frustrated by what he believed to
be a college quota of admitting two
black students per year, Murphy
spent the summer of 1969 traveling
through the Southeast to recruit black
students.

Nine of the students he recruited
that summer were accepted, and
seven of them ended up enrolling in
Davidson.

also started the Black Student Coali-
tion, although none of them had any
notion that it would one day become
a recognized organization on cam-
pus.

Despite his struggles, Murphy
does not regret his Davidson experi-
ence and claims that he found enter-
ing law school in 1977 to be much
easier because of it.

“Frankly, I think it made me a
better person,” Murphy said. “I think
I grew a great deal while I was here.
Some might think that you would
come away feeling bitter, but I did
not.”

Perez came to Davidson over
twenty years later as a Puerto Rican
from Fort Lauderdale, Florida and
also found it difficult to adjust to the
college’s racial atmosphere as one of
the two Hispanics on campus.

“Thad to take speech therapy class
because I spoke Spanglish,” said
Perez. “I also had a lot of colorful
words in my vocabulary that I con-
sidered normal.”

Perez, who was ona football schol-
arship, had trouble keeping up with
the amount of work required at
Davidson and nearly left the college
after the team was demoted from
Division III to Division I.

“Christmas break, I packed up
everything,” Perez said. “I stopped
by the director of admissions to say
goodbye because he had recruited
me. He locked me in the office for
three hours and literally convinced
me to stay. I did not gohome. I stayed
there for most vacations because I did
not have the bus fare to go home.”

According to Perez, his situation
improved during his junior year.

“T realized it was not Davidson’s
jobtounderstand me,” Perez said. “It

was my job to help them understand
me. I started to learn the language. I
started to learn to study. I started to
get help.”

Though Perez experienced several
personality conflicts at Davidson and
struggled to fit in with the black stu-
dents while retaining his Puerto
Rican identity, he, like Murphy, val-
ues the impact that Davidson had on
his life.

“I tell people I was born in New
York and raised in Fort Lauderdale,
but I was reborn at Davidson,” Perez
said.

After the panelists’ discussion,
audience members were invited to
ask questions and then to participate
in small group dialogues on race re-
lations and the minority experience
at Davidson.

Although students and faculty
members were passionate about the
ideas raised in both the discussion
and the dialogues, they regretted that
there was not more participation.

“I would encourage people to
come to things like this,” said Emily
Presley ’07, who served as a facilita-
tor for the dialogues. “There is aneed
to make yourself feel uncomfortable.
I tried inviting my friends, but they
said they had too much work. It is
really good to be able to hear about
Davidson’s history.”

Brandon Zeigler ’08 helped coor-
dinate some of the events and was
also disappointed by the low turnout.

“So much on this day, people just
take it asea day off from school,”
Zeigler said. “You would think that
more people would take time to look
back on what has changed. You miss
out on good things. So many students
are missing out on this because they
are asleep or doing homework.”

Participants began at Richardson
Stadium and finished near Cham-
bers.

Upon the completion of the race,
runners gathered for a reading of Dr.
King’s “I Have a Dream” speech on
the steps of Chambers.

All the proceeds from the walk will
benefit the Martin Luther King, Jr.
Memorial Project.

Secretary of Alpha Phi Alpha
Brandon Zeigler ’05 said that his fra-
ternity not only became involved
with Martin Luther King Day be-
cause it was a great cause, but also
because Martin Luther King, Jr. him-
self was a member of Boston
University’s Alpha Phi Alpha chap-
ter while he was still in graduate
school.

“It is not just a day to miss school,
but to take time to look back on the
past of civil rights in our country,”
Zeigler said.

“We can reflect, grow and learn
from the past so that history will not
repeat itself.”

Alpha Phi Alpha chapters all over
the country are helping to raise
money for the $100 million Martin
Luther King, Jr. memorial that will
be built on the National Mall in
Washington, D.C.

Alpha Phi Alpha hopes to raise
$5,000 by the end of the year to con-
tribute to the project.

Fluker is a professor of philoso-

. phy and religion at Morehouse Col-

lege, a historically black college in
Atlanta, Georgia. He based his con-
vocation speech around the topic of
leadership.

Acommunity discussion followed

the Union.

New this year to the Martin Luther
King Day celebratory events oncam-
pus was the “Gospel Extravaganza.”

The Davidson College Gospel
Choir combined with neighboring
choirs in the Duke Family Perfor-
mance Hall on Sunday night.

Assistant Dean of Student Life
Ernest Jeffries said that he was par-
ticularly excited for the Davidson
College Gospel Choir concert be-
cause it was their first large-scale
concert for the campus to enjoy.

Davidson alumni Calvin Murphy
°70 and Anthony C. Perez ’92 served
as panelists for “The History of the
Minority Experience at Davidson.”

Perez and Murphy spoke about
their personal experiences as minor-
ity students at Davidson.

“King Day for Kids” allowed chil-
dren of all ages and their parents to
do crafts-and listen to stories about
Dr. King.

“There were at least sixty kids at
peak time, which is more than there
have been the last few years,” said
volunteer Beth DeBevoise ’06.

Small group discussions followed
the afternoon program under the
theme “A Dialogue on Race at
Davidson.”

Monday night’s panel discussion
moderated by Dr. Nancy Fairley was
entitled, “The New Racism: A New
Age of Prejudice” and addressed the
many different forms of racism, not
just the black-white contrast.

Jefferies viewed Martin Luther
King Day as an opportunity for stu-
dents to unite over the life of the in-
fluential leader.

“Dr. King’s ideals are very similar
to what we are about at Davidson,”
said Jeffries.
