“These players are much
more agressive than ever
before."’

Sterling predicts that this
team will score more and be
harder to stop’ than last
year's Southern Conference
champs.

‘‘We've got more than forty
players trying out, and
they're all in shape and
ready to play,’ he said.

Several outstanding fresh-
men have come out for the
team.

Sterling expressed parti-
cular interest in Tom Tornee,
a lineman, and Joe Duncan,
a half. Both are considered
prospective starters.

Don Bain, formerly an all-
state goalie from Georgia,
has been moved to fullback
and is a_ possible starter.

The team presently has
four goalies.

“He is an exceptionally

Harriers Depend On Freshmen

Davidson cross - country
coach Sterling Martin played
the part rather well.

The part was that of a
coach whose team had a 1-14
won-lost recorc last
and whose hopes for the up-
coming season depend main-
ly on a group of freshmen.

“I’m approaching the sea-
son with guarded optimism,”
said Martin.

But just a little too much
excitement showed through
Martin’s comments, spoiling
the act.

“The group of freshmen we
have this year are potential-
ly the best that Davidson has

A cross-country coach can
rarely afford to get excited
about freshmen, because
freshmen must adjust from a

school to the much more
strenuous five- or six-mile
college event, and this usual-

Martin, however, expects

the problem to be the re-
verse.

“With this group of fresh-
men, the upperclassmen are
going to be hard-pressed to
stay ahead,’ he said.

In fact, Martin expects the
top four runners on this sea-

son's squad to be freshmen.

Martin’s choice ffor the
number one position on the
team is Ricky Bell, who was
state mile champion of the
Virginia’ Prep League and
was undefeated in two years
of cross-country competition
at Woodbury Forest.

Bell, who has a 4:23 mile
and 1:59 half-mile to his
credit, is ‘‘a real fighter,”
according to Martin.

Hot on Bell's heels will be
Rick Mullen, Ricky Deal,
and Chip Schleider.

Mullen, from Roanoke, Va.,
holds two course records at
his high school and is the
top challenger for the first
position.

Deal has recorded an im-
pressive 28:50 for 5.5 miles.
This time is close to the rec-
ord for the Davidson course,
which is only five miles long.

Schleider, says Martin,
“could be number one if he
decided ‘to really work at it.”

This bevy of _ talented
underclassmen will produce a
real dogfight for the remain-
ing spots on the team.

Senior Howard Boyd, last
year’s number one runner
and team captain this year,
is expected to get the num-
ber five position.

Returning lettermen Joe
Shibley, Ron Clark, David
Reed, and Don Butts will bat-
tle for the remaining slots,
along with sophomores Pete
Kyle and George Edwards,
and freshman Bob Lauten-
sack.

But the four top freshmen
and Boyd will, Martin hopes,
“provide a team nucleus—
which is what we need,” and
push the Wildcats to a fourth-
place finish in the Southern
Conference.

Martin’s harriers finished
last in the conference last
year, due to ‘‘a really tough
schedule.”

“IT hope that these fresh-
rarely afford to get excited
men will be able to run with
the leaders,” said Martin.

“If they can, then we can
compete with VMI, The Cit-
adel, and Furman, and with
luck we can get fourth.”

With luck and four able
freshmen, you can _ hardly
blame Martin for getting ex-
cited, even if he won’t admit
it.

returned to the team after
their Junior Year Abroad.

Steve Culbertson has re-
turned to his inside position.
Culbertson was high scorer
in his sophomore year.

“It's hard to replace a
player like Gudmunder Kar!l-
sson’’ Sterling commented,
‘but overall we are as sharp
as before and more agres-
sive than last vear’s team.”

The soccer schedule has
been shortened by three
games, due to a substantial
cut in the soccer budget.

Last year the team mem
bers circulated a_ petition
and gathered more than 600
signatures from students and
faculty protesting the cut.

This leaves the kickers
with an 11 game schedule,
well below the number of
games most college teams
schedule, according to Sterl
ing.

During the season they
will face some strong com-
petition, including Duke,
N. C. State, and Belmont-
Abbey and St. Andrews Pres
byterian, two schools that
do not field football teams
and specialize in soccer dur-
ing the fall. =

Sterling also expects to re-
form the soccer club after
its success last spring.

We will need some sort of
program to absorb the play-
ers we have to cut,"’ he said.

The club has’ been ap-
proached by several local
teams and high school teams,
for fall games.

Sterling said a great aid
to the team’s practice would
be the use of a practice field
and two practice goals.

The portable goals were
purchased recently and _ al-
low more practice time for
the large number of prospec-
tive players.
