Shannon Speaks On Merton In Staley Lecture Program

By LEE WHITE

“The work of Thomas Mer-
ton,”” Father William Shannon
said Monday night, “has helped
me realize God not as someone
out there, but as, in Merton’s
words, ‘the hidden ground of
love.’”

Shannon, this year’s lecturer
in the Staley Distinguished Chris-
tian Scholar Lecture Program,
presented a series of lectures and
events this week. The subject of
these events was “Thomas Mer-
ton: A Contemporary Spiritual-
ity.”

Thomas Merton (1915-1968)
was a trappist monk. He became
famous as a writer with the publi-
cation of a bestselling autobiog-
raphy The Seven Storey Mountain
in 1948. Merton was the author of
- 40 books and 1,000 poems.

Shannon is the author of
Thomas Merton's Dark Path: The
Inner Experience of a Contempla-
tive (1981). In 1982, he was ap-
pointed general editor of the let-
ters of Thomas Merton. Editing
Merton's letters was a three-year

task involving tracking down let-
ters written to people living all
over the world. Shannon said the
original manuscript of the letters
had to be edited because it was
“1,276 double-spaced, typed
pages.” The finished volume,
published this year is entitled The
Hidden Ground of Love.

Shannon was a professor at
Nazareth College when his inter-
est in Merton studies was sparked
by two students who urged him to
teach a seminar in Merton. Shan-
non remarked that “the real learn-
ers in the educational process are
teachers.”

In his speech Monday night,
“Prayer and Action in the World,”
Shannon described how as he
taught students about Merton he
came to see how pertinent his
work was.

Shannon said he understood
Merton’s theological approach to
be the methodology of the ‘‘ques-
tion.” Thomas Merton once
wrote: “I do not have clear an-
swers .. . I do have questions.”
Shannon said he saw the central

task of theology as wrestling with
difficult questions. In his search
for answers to questions about
God and about life, Merton learn-
ed from the religious experiences
of East and West, he added.

In his speech, Shannon em-
phasized Merton’s concern with
contemplation. In contemplation
Merton sought union with God. In
this union, he met all men and
women in God as persons. For
Merton, contemplation was the
basis for social concern. Shannon
quoted Merton’s words: “I disap-
pear to be everywhere with hid-
denness and compassion.”

Merton believed that through
contemplation one came to aware-
ness. For Merton, the experience
of contemplation was more than a
change in behavior. It
change in consciousness.

The awareness gained from
this change in consciousness re-
stored one to a true vision of God.
This true vision, Merton believed,
was lost in the Fall.

Was a

Shannon said a contemplative

lifestyle is a difficult thing to
teach. However, he said, an at-
titude for contemplation could be
encouraged. He remarked that to
truly become a contemplative is to

become ‘‘counter-cultural.”
Shannon spoke Tuesday night
on “Merton and Modern Social Is-
sues.’ He also conducted a retreat
at DCPC Wednesday afternoon.

‘Black Concerns ’ Symposium Reaches Other Institutions

Davidson College and NCNB

Senior Class

Seniors still have time to
pledge money for the class gift.
The original fund drive from
March 22-April 4 has been ex-
tended indefinitely. The senior
class raised between $41,000 and
$42,000 during the first two
weeks of the drive, falling short of
the $65,000 goal, according to
Martha Nelson co-chairperson of
the Executive Class Gift Commit-
tee.

Co-chairperson Shep Robin-
son said the drive was “set for two
weeks with hopes that people
would get [the cards] in” but the

pleased with the outcome of the
symposium. The symposium was
intended to reach out to other col-
leges and universities as well as

4.

He said eighty senior ‘“bro-
kers” are “in charge of contacting
three or four other seniors to get
pledges” for the project. Nelson
said about 100 seniors have not
been contacted. While the com-
mittee urges seniors to return the
cards as soon as possible, there is
no absolute deadline.

Robin said Mike Wilkinson
and Tony Holt plan to check the
computer list for the brokers who
have not turned in the cards and
will put pressure on them to do so.
The brokers were chosen from a
variety of sources, including a

He said there was “good represen-

houses and those eating indepen-

Robinson said the fund drive:
“has been running real well.
We've had a training session and a
banquet for the brokers” and have
met with President John Kuyken-
dall. He attributes the delay in the
project's completion to seniors
being hard to reach.

Johnson C. Smith University
President Dr. Robert Albright
spoke on the future of historically
black colleges over the next 25
years.

Albright believes that several
problems are hurting the current
status of historically black col-
leges. One problem is that of re-
ceiving re-accredidation. Another
problem Albright has termed the
“brain drain phenomena.” This
term describes the difficulty the
historically black colleges are
having in competing for the most
intelligent black students and fac-
ulty members with about 3,000
other institutions. The historically
black colleges are also having dif-
ficulty battling for support and re-
sources. Albright also feels all in-
stitutions will suffer from a de-
clining federal commitment to
higher education.

Referring to the future Al-
bright said, “I think black colleges
over the next 25 years will perhaps
be more critical in terms of the
role they will play to this nation
than they have been in the last 25
or 50 years.” He attributes this
projection to two factors. First,
because public schools plan to
raise their academic standards,
many black students will only be
given an opportunity to gain a

higher education through the his-

torically black colleges which are
more willing to take a chance on
students according to Albright.
Second, many black students
come ‘from suspect educational
environments and need special
programs when they get to college
which most colleges and univer-

sities do not provide. ;

Albright believes some histor-
ically black colleges will merge
with institutions close to them and
others will become two-year tn-
stitutions. He believes some will
go out of business while others
will be strengthened as states
grow and maintain a commitment
to integration.

Dr. Marcus Alexis, professor
and chairman of the Economics
Department at Northwestern Uni-
versity, addressed the issue of re-
cruitment and retention of black
students on predominantly white
campuses. Dr. C. Eric Lincoln,
professor of religion and culture at
Duke University, spoke on the af-
tirmative action issue. Dr. Bertha
Maxwell, Frank Porter Graham
Professor and chairman of Atro
American and African studies at
the University of North Carolina
at Charlotte, spoke about the sig
nificance oof — Afro-American
studies as a viable academic dis-
cipline.
