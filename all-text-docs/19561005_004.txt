son cadets finished the six week's
course with outstanding records
both in their individual ‘companies
and in the entire cadet corps.

As the training program for the
six weeks unfolded, it was evident
that the Army spares no expense
to train the men who today make
up a large portion of the officer
cadre of the American military
services. The cadets undergoing
this training discovered that it is

a far ery from reading about tactics.

in a textbook to the actual work-
ing out of problems “on the
ground.”

OFFICERS ROTATE

To increase individual cadet par-

ticipation and to give each cadet} ’

an opportunity to gain experience
in the job of leading’ men, cadet
officers were named in each com-
pany and these posts were changed
every day. One day might disclose
a cadet in the last rank of the
last squad and the next day might
find him leading an entire com-
pany.

This Sort of practical training is
employed here at Davidson in the
cadet regiment and it is easily
the most effective method of teach-
ing future officers the ins and outs.
the do’s and don’ts and the tech-|
niques and means of command
functions.

ALL ARMY PHASES PRESENTED

All phases of the Army were
presented to the cadets and oppor-
tunity was given them to operate
most of the small. weapons now in
use by the U. S. Army. The Engi-
neers, Signal Corps, Medical Corps,
Transportation Corps and virtual-
Jy all of the technical and admini-
strative branches of the Army were
presented to the cadets by both
thorough demonstrations and prac-
tical exercises.

The effectiveness of Artillery
and Armor was vividly shown in
a number of demonstrations and
problems which not only served to
impress upon the cadets the im-
portant function of these two com-
bat arms, but also to reveal to
them the extensive amount of plan-
ning and coordination necessary to
any effective combat operation.

The bulk of the’ training was
directed at infantry techniques and
tactics, for it is this branch which
provides the best ground for teach-
ing men the techniques of leader-
ship and small unit command, to
say nothing of the fact that the
Infantry is the primary combat
branch of the Army.

Not all was work and lighter
moments were occupied by dances

3-DAY FIELD MANUEVER

‘All of the many hours of demon-
stration, classes and practical ex-
ercise were culminated by a three.
day field manuever in which the:
entire cadet’ corps operated as
a tactical unit in the field. For
three days and three nights the
;eadets came as close to living the
life of a soldier in combat as is
possible to approximate in a peace-
time situation,

Psychology Staf
To Lead Discussion on
Television Program

There will be a showing in the
College Union October 12 at 9:30

‘p.m.. of the dramatization of the
-trial of a man practicing psycho-
_logy while accused of the fraud

that he wis not licensed nor quali-
fied for the. practice of. either psy-
chology or psychiatry.

This case was brought to light

by Mrs. Valerie Nicholson and As:-.

sociated Press corresondent in
Southern Pines. Because of many

-'eonfidences between the accused
it

and his clients, evidence had been
extremely difficult to produce un-
til the entrance of Miss Nicholson
into the affair.

Listed originally to be shown on
September 28. the television pro-
gram was rescheduled to the later
time upon instigation presumably
of the sponsors in that the show.
ing at this time might throw an
aura of pre-determined guilt upon
the accused.

The program “Nightmare,” stars
Sara Seegar as Valerie Nicholson
and is intended to show the
methods of newspaper correspon-
dents in the bringing to light of
supposedly unlawful or unethical
practices in the fields of services
vital to the mental and physical
health of the public.

Following the television show-
ing, Drs. Workman, Bevan, and
MacBrayer will lead an authorita-
tive discussion upon the topic
which is to be open to all interet-
ed. This is sponsored by the Union

Round Table committee headed by

Leon Howell. This discussion will
be in an informal vein accompa-
nied with the serving of coffee.

Sent to Colleges

The Davidsonian, realizing that
politics is a chief issue on college

campuses at the present time, has

mailed letters to virtually every

college newspaper in the tri-state
area of North and South Carolina

and Virginia. The letter proposes
a poll of the students in the vari-
ous colleges on the presidential

election in November.

Collectively, some 75,000 stu-
dents can express their views and

preferences through this medium.
The results of the poll to be

published in The Davidsonian, and

the other papers contacted during
‘tthe week prior to the election will
be surveyed by students through:

out the area.

Actually, the purpose of this
poll is two-fold. Through the co-
operation of the editors of the
various college newspapers, a
permanent

papers in this section into a type
of
tion. '
If the poll is conducted in the
manner prescribed, all students
in the tri-state area will be con-
tacted, resulting in an authorita-
tive forecast of just how college
students in the South will vote.

Masquers_ Present

The Red and Black Masquers,
the college dramatic group, an-
nounced today the cast for the
