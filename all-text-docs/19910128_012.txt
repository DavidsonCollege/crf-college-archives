plane flights, since supposedly
the flight itself already has some
diuretic effect on the body. This
coupled with a few. small $3
drinks, can lead to an especially
bad hangover due -to dehydra-
tion. ;

A warm feeling accompany-
ing a “buzz” is misleading. In
fact, alcohol does not warm you
up, but it cools you down. It

tocirculate in the capillaries right
below the skin. More deep body
heat is transfered to the skin, and
from there to the air. Because of,
this, itis more dangerous to drink
in.cold..weather. than in warm
weather.

So, be careful out there, and
don’t pass out in the middle of|
the court. You’ll freeze!
