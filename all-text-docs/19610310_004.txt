Pilot’s Strange Gift Put

His Name On Chambers

By JIM WILLIAMS
Davidsonian Feature Writer

In the depth of the depression years, Davidson

received one of its strangest

gifts. An early aviator who

buzzed over this area of the Carolina Piedmont was

responsible.
Major Howard Davidson. so

the story goes, was the crusty
commander of the United States
Air Corps at Bolling Field.
Washington, D. C. He made
several flights over North Caro-
lina, and” often noticed the
neatly arranged brick buildings
some twenty miles north of
Charlotte.

Finally, while on a flight
from Brownsville, Texas, to
Washington, D. C. in August
1931, the major landed his
plane near these buildings,
and set out on foot to find
out for himself what they
were. Ultimately, he was
ushered into the office of Or.
Walter L. Lingle, president
of Davidson Coliege.

Major Davidson was particu-
larly impressed when he learned
the name of the institution. He
explained to President Lingle
that pilots could not see the
name of the school because
there was no air marker.

Accordingly, he offered per-
sonally to pay the. expenses of
painting the name “Davidson”
in 12 foot letters on top of the
roof of the newly built Cham-
bers Building.

Vespers Offering
Goes For Legal Aid;

The vespers: offering last
Sunday. was $71.65, the largest
offering of the year with the
exception of the Christmas
vespers offering. This offering
went into the Legal Aid and:
Scholarship Fund established by!
the National Student Christian
Federation.

The purpose of this fund is to|
aid financially any student who
needs legal aid as a result of
seeking equal rights for all per-
sons. This would include such
things as “sit-ins” and picketing
for the cause of integration.

The decision of the YMCA
Cabinet to contribute the offer-

Whether Major Davidson was
motivated more by a desire to
see his name painted on the
buildings below, or whether he
wanted his pilots to have a:
marker on a prominent feature;
to navigate by has never been:
ascertained.

Nevertheless, Dr. Lingle
replied that he would be glad
to investigate the cost of such
a project and to let the major |
know.

After showing the visitor |
around the college, Dr. Lingle,
saving the best until last, re-
marked, “And did you know, |!
Major Davidson, that over sixty
percent ‘of our graduates enter
the Presbyterian ministry?" |

Aw hell!” came the reply.
‘That's awful, ain't it?”

A few weeks later the col-
lege received Major Oavid-
son‘s personal check and the
air marker was painted over
Chambers. it has faded out
since then. The 30 years of
sunshine, rain, and snow have
wiped the copper roof of the
building clean.

Further investigation reveals
that possibly Major Davidson
never landed his plane here at
all; that maybe he simply cor-
responded with the college by
mail. One thing is sure, how-
ever. In late October of 1931,
any pilot flying over the school:

of Chambers.

Water Dominates History,

Culture Of The Netherland

By HAN MENSINK
Richardson Scholar
Editor's Note: This is the thirteenth in a series of articles
by Richardson Scholars about customs and characteristics
of their hometands, or on their impressions of Davidson.
By the time, ten or a hundred years from now, men
could see the name “Davidson” | have landed on the moon, it will probably be impossible
in white, 12 foot letters on top: to distinguish national characters on. earth any longer.
When people can get from Peking to Amsterdam, or
from Melbourne to New York within an hour, no one

will by his apperance show

But we have not reached that
point yet. Nationality and lang-
uage are still, to some extent,
elements which bind together
people of different characters
and intelligence.

WATER BATTLE

The history of The Nether-
lands has been dominated by
the water. If it were not for a
never ceasing association and
battle with the water, The
Netherlands would simply not
exist anymore.

This battle can be carried on
only by the joint efforts of all,
hence the capacity of the Dutch-
man for co-operation, and hence
perhaps too the rise of democ-
racy without revolution, and
with roots reaching back into
the distant and famous past.

For it is a long time since
one man alone could take care
of the protection of his dyke
area. But the water is not just
an enemy to be kept in chains:
it has also a very useful func-
tion in providing an open con-
nection with other countries and
continents.

where he comes from.

The Netherlander is ‘sociable
too, because he is forced into
co-operation; tolerant and mod-

erate, because without, no joint |.

work is possible; patient, be-
cause dealing with water and
voyaging over the seas take
time; and industrious, because
without industry, no headway
can be made against the water.

NOT STRIKING

In general, on closer acquaint-
ance with the Dutchman, one
will not be struck by such pro-
nounced characteristics as the
vivacity of the Italian, the Eng-
lishman’s self assurance or the
German fanaticism. The Dutch-
man has no characteristics that
strike at once: one gets to know
him through his work, and the
organization of the few means
of life nature has entrusted to
him.

‘He can be studied through the
organized nature of the bulb.
fields, through the great dykes
or the deltaplan, or in the enor-
mous dairy factory at my home
city, where all the milk of all
the pedigree cows in Frisia is
brought together.

Finally, although the word

“Dutch” is often used in other],

countries to describe, as Queen
Juliana has put it, “anything

{that is done differently or un-

usually” the Dutch way of life
is actually not very different
from that df other peoples, and
the visitor to the Netherlands
will see little to make him run
back home and write a book on
“these queer Dutch.”

Fleming Wilt Speak
