THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

FRIDAY; OCTOBER 27, 1961

A Spirit And A Tradition

The report of the Davidson Col-
lege Board of Visitors released today
formulated our academic and financial
goal for the next ten years: ©

Our goal is to make Davidson the
best college of its type—not just in the

South, but in all of America. With a

steadily improving student body,
faculty, and campus plant, this church-
related liberal arts college for 1,000
men can—with generous support from
our friends and the alumni—achieve
this goal in the decade ahead.

We are pleased with this objec-
tive and the general aims of the new
ten-year plan, but we must ask our-
selves if $20,487,523, a faculty of
scholars, a student body of the na-
tion’s most intelligent gentlemen, and
25 modern major buildings will make
us the best college of our type in
America.

Davidson is not the first college
to attempt this goal, and if we fail,
we will not be alone in failuré. Other
institutions have sallied off with sums
greater than $20,487,523 only to dis-
cover that something more is needed.

To be truly great, a college must
have tradition and spirit—a liberal
tradition of a spirit of free and ex-
cited search for the answers to real
questions.

We must have good professors;
but primarily, we must have a dynam-

Can Davidson Be

Dr. Henri Peyre spoke right to
the heart of several matters of local
interest in his observations on educa-
tion in Tuesday’s assembly. Fortun-
ately, he had a captive audience then;
his other addresses and enlightened
comments fell upon very few ears.

The activities of the last four days
reflect the very dangers and problems
he recognized in American educa-
tion. Perhaps today he is less praising
of Davidson. We do breed business-
men; we don't dare cross business; we
aren't making the “imaginative use of
freedom,” Peyre called for.

His side comments about fund-
raising, “sincerity,” and the bowing of
education to business turned out to be
prophetic. The words must have
haunted him Tuesday and Wednesday
as he was ignored in the college’s all-
out preparation for our really import-
ant “Guests” this week.

He could not avoid noticing (could
anyone?) this slight, by both students
and administration. No major member
of the college family introduced him,
accompanied him, or attended his ad-
dresses; yet he saw them all come out
Wednesday night at the deluxe “din-
ner-party” for the Board of Visitors.
It is ludicrous to compare his recep-
tion with that afforded to the Visitors
with their influential positions and
well-lined pockets.

We realize that Davidson has to
compete in a vicious business world
for the money it needs to carry out

ic. creative faculty freed of a subtle
web of oaths and restrictions. We
must seek well-qualified students, but
fewer cool guys and more live guys.
Our students must be different, vital
men with different, vital ideas not
just candidates for the Presbytery,
Bar, Chamber of Commerce, and
AMA.

We must cease to be afraid of
new men and new ideas, of experi-
ment, and of controversy.

Education is not a finish of dull
glazing. It is a bold search. It is this
bold spirit which we must encourage
if we intend to be first among colleges.

Furthermore, we must develop,
cherish, and insure a liberal tralition
of free thinking and freedom to think
in which a first-class spirit of inquiry
can survive and grow. Davidson must
be conservative in preserving the
liberal areas in its present tradition
and liberal in making changes in the
restrictive, conservative areas.

Robert Hall Morrison has said,
“We begged the college into exist-
ence.” However, not the most in-
gratiating of the representatives of
Madison Avenue among us can beg us
into first place among America’s small
church-affiliated liberal arts colleges.
The real progress must be a change
from within. ~

its program. We are g/ateful to Mr.
Dana; we are appreciative for all that
the Board of Visitors is able to accom-
plish.. We should express this grati-
tude and appreciation. But there is a
point beyond which a college can not
afford to compromise. We treaded
that point unsteadily this week.

_ Madison Avenue might well take
notice of our smooth, organizational
tactics. Surely, they have nothing over
our public relations men in turning
out elaborate, glib brochures to at-
tract the buyer. We have something
valuable to offer. But it isn’t some-
thing to be put up for bids on the
market.

We in America have educated for
business too much, Dr. Peyre com-
mented. We at Davidson are dedicat-
ing our time and energies to business
too much. What scholar or educator
(obviously not Dr. Peyre) would ever
receive the red-carpet treatment, and
right-at-the-elbow attention given our

The Reynolds Lecture -was a
come-on—money well spent to record
in the next brochure that we had Dr.
Henri Peyre on campus. Our college
family gained so much from his visit.
His coming is another indication Dav-
idson is well on the way to being THE
best college of its type not only in the
South but in all America.

Can any of this be sincere?

BY BILL HAGEN
Davidsonien Managing Editor

The new 15 year program’s
main monetary emphasis will be,
in the realm of attracting, train-
ing, and holding high caliber
instructors.

Six million dollars alone, will
be collected and invested to pro-
vide for $240,000 a year to in-
crease faculty salaries. This will
help correct the disparity pres-
ently existing between Davidson
professors’ salaries on all levels,
and the average for typical
‘men’s liberal arts colleges in
the South.

Incentives and travel-research
grants will be used both for
salary increments, graduate
study, and for research projects
involving travel. Under the new
program, an additional $48,000
per year would be available.

Over a million dollars will be

six ‘key” chairs which will at-
tract top-flight scholars.

Endowment needs other than
faculty total $6,900,000. In the
areas of student scholarships
and the international student
program 3% million dollars is
needed; both to maintain and
expand.

With an aim of increasing the
library's book stock from 87,000
to 150,000 in the next decade,
$20,000 more a year will be
necessary.

12 million dollars will be
needed to pay tor additional in-
structional equipment, a special-
ist to care for it and for main-
tenance of the present physical
plant.

The physical education pro-
gram, which cannot be support-
ed solely by: gate receipts, will
require a $400,000 endowment
to keep un its present standards

Harding Analyses
Economic Problem

BY STEVE HARDING
Richardson Scholar _

This article is primarily in-
tended as a layman's analysis of
Britain and the Common Market
and is not meant to cover more
than just a skeleton of the facts.

There are at the moment two
thriving economic groups in
Europe: THE EUROPEAN FREE
TRADE AREA, referred to as
EFTA or “The Seven,” which
consists of Britain. Portugal,
Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Aus-
tria and Switzerland; and THE
EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COM-
MUNITY, EEC or “The Six,”
which is made up of West Ger-
many, France, Belgium, Italy
and Luxembourg.

The EEC is always termed
“THE COMMON Market.” A
rough indication of relative in-
comes is, for “the Seven”, $108,
000,000,000 (pop. 89 million of
which Britain’s contribution is
52 million) and, for “the six”,

The Students Speak Out

The Academic Scheduling Poll
taken last Tuesday by the Student
Council and THE DAVIDSONIAN gave
a fairly clear picture of student body
opinion. Although only about 400
students completed it, we feel that at
least three suggestions have great
student approval: ;

1, Continue the present eight-day

examination schedule.

2. Provide a one or two day read-

ing period before exams begin.

3. Extend the semester break to

about four days.

A great many students suggested
extending Spring Holidays as well as

the semester break. Many showed they
had given at least some thought to the
problem by suggesting that school run
later in June. The advantages of an
early Commencement are outweighed
in the minds of most students by the
desire for more time off during the
school year.

The Academic Scheduling Com-
mittee has had some of its questions
answered. It’s now up to that commit-
tee to attempt a schedule, certainly
in time for next year, which will an-
swer a few of the students’ complaints.

$174,000,000,000 (pop. 167 mil-
lion). A comparable figure for
U. S. A. is $519,000,000,000 (pop.
177,000,000).

The idea of rapprochment is
not new. However Britain is not
prepared to sign “The treaty of
Rome,” the Common Market
Constitution, as it stands. She
wants concessions for British
farmers and for the Common-
wealth which are not forthcom-
ing.

Before further comment it
might be worth looking at the
aims of the Common Market.
The program due for completion
1970-73 includes:

1. Common Internal Tariffs

2. Common External Tariffs

3. Common Agricultural Tar-

iffs

4. Free Labor Movement

5. Common Transport Policy

6. “Fair Competition” Rules

wealth.)

of Europe?)

Thete is much more than
vovid be included in this article
but I hope what I have mention-
ed will help to clarify the situa-
tion.

Let me say that there is no
doubt that if Britain did join
the- Common Market, it would
considerably improve her ailing
economy; surely the question is
not “Should Britain join the
Common Market?” but “When
(at what point) should Britain
join the Common Market?”. This
is the problem as many people
see it.

Since writing the above Bri-
tain has pledged to join the
Common Market. She now be-
lieves that the necessary safe-
guards for British Agriculture
and the Commonwealth can be
obtained without alteration to
the major articles of the Rome
Treaty, but by simply adding
protocal—the language that
Europeans understand.

The Government has got off
to a good start and many people
welcome a positive approach.
However it must expect some

hard bargaining in the months
that lie ahead as the problems
involved are far from over. But
it is commendable that they
have set off on the right path.

Those opposed to Britain’s
entry might do well to consider
what will happen if Britain stays
out.

scope.
To brossen the work of the
chaplain’s office and other re-
ligious endeavors, the college
must collect 450,000 dollars.

Non-academic employees, .ad-
ministrative expenses, and the
counseling and clinical pro-
grams will need the income pro
vided by $850,000 to initiate
“must” expansion.

Improvement of Davidson's
physical plant will entail the
expenditure of more than 4%
million dollars.

In the library, plans for the
building of a special room to
house rare books, a reserve
room, enlarged stacks, and for
air-conditioning are in process.
The success of the language lab
has initiated the proposals for
its enlargement.

The facilities of sports, in-
volving tennis, golf, and intra-
mural sports need moderniza-
tion. This, coupled with the
planned development of facili-
ties for water sports on Lake
Norman, will necessitate the
raising of $150,000.

Besides repairs on present
housing, further work will be
done in the faculty sub-division
type of construction. $350,000
will pay the cost of renovation
and expansion of the Carolina
Inn; including 30 motel-type
units and dining facilities.

The Guest House will need
$40,000 for renovation into its
new function as Alumni Center.
The money will also be used to
continue its functions as a
guest reception center, and a
“center for programs of con-
tinuing education.”

125 thousand dollars, if rais-
ed, is earmarked for new equip-
ment for the laundry and park-
ing, walk, and drainage improve-
ments.

Heating and air-conditioning,
and electrical system moderniza-
tion are needed in several of
the buildings. Also, in Chambers
Building alone, new lecture
rooms, auditorium changes, and
an audio-visual aids center will
require approximately $250,000.

The College Union, to improve
its eating facilities and to put
in a separate snack bar and
separate dining rooms, will need
some $150,0u0. This will also
be used for air-conditioning and
expanded meeting space.

Due to the increased number
of students majoring in a
science and the recent advancés
in the physical sciences, some
$123,000. will be spent, if ocl-
lected, for new equipment and
the replacement of old equip-
ment.

Finally, t. culminate the
“completeness” of Davidson Col-
lege, $40,000 is required. Using
the money, a green house will
be constructed to help supple-

ment the work of the Biology
Department.

A Cautious Cultural Climb

BY GREG GOVAN
Davidsonian Feature Writer

espite such “last minute minor crises” as wet paint,
dirt-tracking workmen, and the Board of Visitors, the
J. R. Cunningham Fine Arts Center remained the focus
of attention this week as the “Gala Celebration” was
climaxed with the formal dedication of the building on

Thursday.

The five-day festivities were designed to introduce
not only the center but also the people and arts which it
houses. And amidst crashing curtains and scanty aud-
iences some progress was seen to be made towards this

goal.

But the Muses in their new temple were somewhat “
less than bubbly over the success of the “Gala.” While
no one was willing to comment upon the minor, or major,
limitations of building and student response, there were
indications that optimism was wearing a little thin.

Hardest hit by gremlins was the drama department,
step-child of the Davidson fine arts. Sitting in his narrow
office, John A. Sneden, Director of Dramatics explained
the situation. “When this building was designed, drama
at Davidson was all but dead.”

The Vagabonds successfully revived interest in
drama last year. And in January, the position held by
Sneden was created. The problem was then to integrate
the necessary faciliti¢s. into a building designed as a
recital hall. Sneden commented that his office, which
appears on the blueprints as a broom closet, is indicative
of this. . .

“We are very thankful for what we have, however,”
he said. “The lighting board and sound system are fan-
tastic... that is, excellent. And the facilities are certainly
better than drama has ever had.” But there are unmis-
takable disadvantages when one is a step-child, or even
a newly-returned prodigal.

It was found that the main curtain let too much light
through. A lining was the three hundred pound answer.
Unfortunately, there was no compensation for the added
weight, and after one hour of lined, opaque glory, down

remedied, the curtain now obstinately refuses to stay
closed, and must be held during scene changes, hurting
the audience’s eyes because it is white and not a soft

dark color.

Even the stage wagon, solution to the problem of
providing the same stage for the acoustically different
drama and music departments, was under the jinx. After
all provisions were made for the performance, it was
found that the wagon could not be rolled onto the stage
without being trimmed of its electrical system bulges.
Emergency surgery was performed and the wagon rolled,
minus junction boxes.

But these minor crises in the building thet was
“meant to be shown, not used” were not as alarming as
the death of. student response. The advocates of David-
son’s culture sterility won the opening battle when only
12 non-participating students sat in the “Gala” audience.
it was hoped that participation would take a turn for the
better at Thursday’s voluntary formal dedicatory service.
Donald B. Plott, head of the music department, expected
good turnout; “We'll snag a few students on the way to
the PO,” to supplement the crowd of interested specta-
tors.

Still, everything was not so gloomy as might seem
to be the case. Plott's department faced a “little experi-
mentation with the sound” as the only problem, along
with the tacitly recognized absence of audience. And in
the other wing, Fine Arts Professor Douglas C. Houchens
could complain, openly, only of a “rushed” atmosphere;
his “clean cut” facilities were without fault, with the
possible exception of the handy window to the outside
in one wall of the room which is used to receive art
exhibitions.

Generally, Davidson’s latest showcase (in the tradi-
tion of Patterson Fraternity Court) may serve as head-
quarters for the fine arts quite well, once a few bugs are
ironed out. But if the apathy of the student body is any
indication, the building’s sole use will be a bulky monu-
ment to rich benefactors. For the present, Cunningham
Fine Arts Center stands, all too empty. The embryonic
art collection, the performances, and the building itself
are useless without attendance.

And as doors refused to open, curtains refused to
close, workmen refused to leave, and President Martin
and a group of visiting dignitaries found a stack of beer
cans that were “part of the props” for “Taming of the
Shrew,” everyone stemmed the flow of blood, sweat,
and tears long enough to wonder what John R. Cunning-
ham would say to dedicate his showcase.

Students Hit
Short Holidays

Have you ever wondered what
students write in the space
designated for comments in a
student poll?

THE DAVIDSONIAN has tak-
en a long look at the remarks
on this week's Academic-sched-
uling ballots.

The upshot of the opinions
are summed up very well by one
sophomore’s remark: ‘Davidson
has . . . shorter holidays than
any other four-year college in
this state. Certainly the student
body deserves more than this
pittance.”

A senior referred to gradua-
tion as the “ridiculous exodus in
May.” He wants the exodus to
come in June, with the extra
time being added to the mid-
semester “break” in order that
it may justify its name.

A sophomore who wants sit
days taken from class time to
make a reading period before
exams believes that “class time
itself is hardly indicative of the
amount and quality of work
done since so many classes are
essentially farcical.”

One student who wants the
exam schedule arranged on
“logic, for a change” believes
that exams should end on a
Saturday and that a vacation
Should be given the next week,
to include the week-end. “A
week-end is the only chance
the average Davidson student
has to date.” He circled “senior”
on the ballot and under it wrote
“who has definite ideas due to
many scheduling frustrations!”
He did not say whether or not
the frustrations came from
scheduling classes or dates...
