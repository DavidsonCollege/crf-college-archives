‘Representational’

Reflected In G

raphics

By GARY GARVIN

Sometimes a big thing needs
pointing out. Through the ex-
traordinary publicity and ad-
ministration of art professor
Herb Jackson, the second
Davidson National Print and
Drawing Competition opened
Fine Arts Building, at the least,
a most impressive show. The
most impressive show. The
competition drew over 3000 en-
tries from all 50 states. From
these. 210 were selected tor
exhibition

The show will be on display
until the end of April. A couple
of hours at ‘the gallery will
prove well worth the ettort
Further. it) provides a good
chance to buy some high quality
art. Prices run as high as
several hundred dollars. but the
bulk of the prints are on sale at
the $20 to $50 price range.

The show owes its particular
success to Jackson's obtaining
of a more-than-able judge.
Clement Greenberg. Greenberg
is Widely published and is one of
America’s foremost art critics.
He met the challenge with
meticulous care. To give ob-
jectivity to his decisions. he
went over the rejected entries a
second time.

The show. Greenberg says.
reflects. “the most solid ten-
dencies of contemporary pic-
torial art in this country.’’ The
competition confirms for him
that. “more or less ‘straight’
representational art continues
as before to produce more good
pictures than any other kind.”
Whether or not he expresses
here his own preference,
representation does charac-
terize, ‘‘more or less’, the
bulk of the show.

“Representation” is a
general term. not really
descriptive of anything. which
could be loosely characterized
as art where the artist works
with recognizable objects in a
recognizable way. This is done
in several works traditionally.
in nude. portrait. or landscape
studies. and in others not so
traditionally.

This detimition. however. says
nothing of the creative and ex-
pressive atmosphere the artists
place their objects in. let alone
the realization of subject mat-
ter through effective use of
medium.

Perhaps the most impressive
“representative” works are
those by Peter Milton —
“Passage III” and ‘Passage
IV. As in his earlier works
based on Henry James story
“The Jolly Corner.” Milton
selects the environment for his
interior-exteriors from the past.

In front of old brownstone
houses men labor with the
prototype of a Wright brothers
airplane. some pose. and others
hover etfortlessly in the Milton
environment. Men are placed in
a mystical perspective space.
and the mystery is contributed
to by the implications of the
shaped picture plane.

Traditional portraiture is con-
cisely yet effectively presented
in the studies by Paul Blakey.
“John Hurdy, 2:30 P.M.” or in
the curiously association con-
text of Marcia Isaacson’s
**Members of the John Elbert
Family.”

The notion of art as represen-
tational, however. should not
detract from the formal de-
mands of the graphic medium,
for example, as foundin Raphael
Soyer's explicit understanding
of line and drawing in his self
portrait lithograph. or Vivian
Berman's highly innovative and

expressive use of texture in her
print “Ariel.”

I will not attempt to define the
term “graphic.” As evident in
the total show. the graphic
vocabulary has been fully ex-
panded by each artist's highly
creative and individual use of
the medium. There are about as
many techniques as there are
artists.

Graphic urt. as opposed to
painting. has never been as
fully appreciated) or un-
derstood. Perhaps the best way
to get the full flavor of the
graphic medium as well as an
exposition of contemporary art
is to see this show. I highly
recommend it

Honors College Purge Stifles

The Honors College is being reviewed
by the faculty. Upgraded. Improved?
Changed. Revised? Altered. Purged.
Discarded. Ruined. Cancelled tor lack
of interest. Axed. Raped. Buried.

Actually the fate of Rowan Helper’s
Hallowed Halls still hangs in the ba-
lance of the EPC, but the proposal in
their hands offers some pretty specific
criticisms of an establishment for
students of “exceptional ability and
maturity."

Such criticism will wash. The Honors
College is inefficient, understaffed, dif-
fused, and overrated. But it is not a bad
idea.

The proposal overlooks this and
suggests in its place a kind of depart-
mentalized independent study honors
junior-senior program lacking in _in-
centive, privilege. exceptional ability.
and maturity. Whytherub? . .

I was interviewed along with several
other students by the committee to
evaluate the progress of the program
over the past three years. This com-
mittee was composed of some of the
most tough-minded b peonemesig on cam-
pus. and they wanted answers.

They wasted no time finding out what
was slack. they posed alternatives. ob-
jections, and reservations. The general
response from all those interviewed
was critical of the Honors College as it
now exists. oe

Consequently some tresh guidelines
for study programs, such as sharper
admission procedures and closer
monitoring and evaluating of the i-
dividual, were anticipated.

Nor did one expect the committee to
dish out a lot of philosophical play
dough about) man ino his academic
COSTINOS

Try one out of two. The proposal is
straightforward. realistic. and specific.
It is not positive.

Suggestions abound for eliminating
much of the folderol. but in attacking
the dead weight. the committee seems
to have given in to a cry for ‘more
weight" fromafaculty of witchhunters.

Take a statement like “There is
general disapproval of the term
‘Honors’ as being misleading. am-
biguous, and unfortunate."

I do not know what that sentence
means, but it strikes me as misleading.
ambiguous, and unfortunate.

But rather than pick at the proposal
at random, consider the emphasis on
anti-elitism to the tune of cost-student.
The report finds it lamentable that the
Honors College eats more bread than
the regular academic program.

Before getting down to the matter of
the financial greening of Davidson.
herein lieth the nature of true elitism:

In the first place. every teacher and
student who sets foot on this campus is
an elitist. a shameless one. Davidson. if
it offers nothing else, has a heritage of
superior quality education that
somehow helps to mitigate everything
else that is wrong with the way the
school is run.

students that come here to scratch
out a 2.0 and sweat like a gym getting
into grad school know how easy it would
be to squat for four years among 105
fifth power) students at the University
of Good Slap making straight A’s sans
effort, waiting sans souci to get into the
nearby Law. Med. Pharmacy. Den-
tistry, or English grad school

No one at Davidson overlooks this
“alternative education” betore coming
here The whole campus wallows in this

impucit elitism.

When Furman cooks past us in B-ball.
we have the consolation of knowing that
it hurts very red you know what I mean.

Three vears ago. for the first time in
the history of this college. that last
bastion of egalitarian education. the
regular curriculum, cracked to let out
students who wanted to pursue an ac-
celerated and independent line of study
not available in the regular classroom
course of instruction.

There were some miserable student
failures who feigned interest for ad-
mission into the program, but this was
the fault of the Honors College faculty.

Outside the Honors College there is
still no chance for an accelerated, in-
dependent education at Davidson. Fhe
proposal will create no new chances.
But now the purge is on. and it is the
student “of exceptional ability and
maturity” who is being turned back in-
to the halls of Chambers to rot.

The college may truly “use its resour-
ces in money and manpower more ef-

fectively.” but it is the student who will
suffer while footing the bill.

And so ,the issue comes back to
money. Yet the administration does not
have enough money to finance
ungeared elitism.

The Wildcat Club can purchase badly
needed muscle which does a lot more
for PR than coeducation. but the ad-
ministration cannot. put its money
where its catalogue is.

If Davidson is to compete
academically with other institutions it
must not retrench but expand the
possibilities for an education to meet
the needs and abilities of each in-
dividual student. particularly the gifted
one

yet still some paunchy profs wonder
if the student body has enough highly
motivated, gifted people to make an
Honors College as it now stands
feasible. ;

Unfortunately, less than half those
presently enrolled at the Carolina Inn
fit the description. But what about the
few who do: Who sets the number:
Twenty? Fifteen? Five?

What matters is that as long as any
student benefits under such a program.
his example eliminates any need for a
show of hands in the faculty. and it is
the duty of this school to provide every
opportunity for such a student.

The proposal does not evaluate the in-
tangible benefits. The recom-
mendations are efficient and practical.
but inconsiderate of that maybe one out
of every 50 freshmen whose mind cries
for something more. much more.
than spending three hours a day
listening to professors and peers who
solicit and receive the platitudinous
blather that spells the number of
gratuitous browns earned for a
meaningless grade and a superficial
education.

I applaud again the efforts of the
faculty to clean up the Honors College.
but it must not forsake the value of that
“other’’ kind of strange education
which really counts.

As Seneca said. **Quaedam remedia
graviora sunt quam ipsa pericula,” or.
never cut your throat to stop a nose
bleed.

The faculty should be more mindtul
of the possibilities it may extend to each
student. If not. the coming vears may
find profs and students alike rumaging
for answers in Roman ruins long since
forgotten.
