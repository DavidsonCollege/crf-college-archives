MEADOWS & SCHENKAR

Karen Jones Meadows

and Joan Schenkar voice

their opinions and attitudes
toward writing and the role
of the female playwright.

March 24, 1995

Because I was unable to
range a dual interview with both
of these playwrights, I asked both
writers the same set of questions
when I interviewed them individu-
ally. This gave each of the play-
wrights a chance to express their
opinions and knowledge openly
with interesting and surprisingly
diverse responses.

Why do you write and why, in
particular, did you _ pick
playwrighting as your medium of
expression?

Schenkar: Easy answers: I
can’thelp myself, and I didn’t pick
it — it picked me. I was in gradu-
ate school, and the papers I was
writing started to develop huge
metaphors. I began to write almost
as though I was speaking as char-
acters. When I was in graduate
school, I was living in the Chelsey
Hotel in New York City. It’s a sort
of famous artist hotel. I think I
wrote the only masters thesis writ-
ten in the Chelsey Hotel.

I was bribed by my father to
go live in Vermont, and it was the
only bribe I ever took — he wanted
me out of the Chelsey. I went to
Vermont (which is a lonely place),
and I began talking to myself. I
began to write those conversations
down, and suddenly I was writing
plays. It was the most organic
thing that’s ever happened to me.

Jones Meadows: I can’t help
but write. I mean, really, Ican’t. I
did really irrational things in terms
of life and lifestyle in order to
write. I write primarily because I
think there is a need and what I
have to say is important.

As for choosing to write plays,
it happened naturally. I loved the-
ater, and I was introduced to the-
ater at a young age... I’ve always
liked the spontaneity and human
contact of theater. It’s both per-
sonal and immediate — where film
is removed. You eat your popcorn
and do all kinds of stuff while you
are watching a film. You get into
a play. It has much more power,
and you really become in love with
the characters, because that re-
moved feeling isn’t there.

To what extent does being a
female influence how you write
and what you choose to. write

about?

Schenkar: Totally. I think
that’s the answer to that. Totally.

In what ways?

Schenkar: Totally. You're
not going to get anymore out of me
than that. Totally. That’s the most
complete answer I can give. Com-
pletely. As a playwright I have to
be able to put my mind into any
gender. I have to write.as a man. I
have to write asa woman. I have to
write as a chair if I’m into heavily
propped plays. I’m always influ-
enced by the body I’m in, and I’m
totally aware of my body. So, what
you get from me will be from that
body’s shape and the way it feels.

Jones Meadows: I don’t

know. I’ve always been com-

_mended by men that I write great

men. My characters come and sit
down and say, “I’m your new sub-
ject. I’m you’re new player.”
Sometimes they’ve been men. In
fact the first several [plays] were
male-heavy.

I think [gender] matters. It’s
interesting because the older I get,
the more gender and race matter.
They used to be less significant. I
don’t know whether I was too na-
ive to see certain things, or they
weren’t there, or it wasn’t my pri-
mary purpose. I think the country
has changed and people are all
squaring off into corners. [ still
believe that we don’t have to have
corners. I try to write characters
who are universal in their actions
and their beliefs. Let the issue be
the problem, not a given set of
qualities that you have no control
over.

How do you go about choos-
ing a certain style when you de-
cide to start writing a play?

Schenkar: I didn’t pick it.
You have it inside you .... I love
language. I’m like a dolphin in
deep water in language. My plays
are always highly linguistic. Even
though each play is set in a differ-
ent vernacular and often in a dif-
ferent accent, they are absolutely
recognizable.

Karen Jones Meadows and Joan Schenkar, multi-talented individuals.

Rob Kosicki

Karen Jones Meadows,
the visiting McGee Professor
of Writing, is a multi-tal-
ented individual who is not
only a playwright but also a
performer and producer. Pres-
ently she is teaching the
playwrighting and screenplay
writing classes for the
Davidson College English
Department. Being an ex-
tremely active playwright and

screenplay writer, she is ex-
perienced in both the theory
of modern theater and film,
and the practical aspects of
today’s theater. Harriet’s Re-

turn, her one-character play
based on the life of the female
abolitionist Harriet Tubman, is
playing at the Crossroads The-
ater in New Jersey, the fore-
most African-American theater
inthe country. She has written
productions that have been on
Comedy Central and Fox Tele-
vision. :

Her current project is a
screenplay which explores the

darker, more violent sides of
human nature,

Joan Schenkar has had her
work produced in experimental
theaters in North America, En-
gland, and Western Europe. She

has won numerous awards, fel-
lowships, and grants for her
writing. Her play Universal
Wolf,a“vicious”
deconstruction of Little Red
Riding Hood, had its regional
premier under the direction of
Professor Joe Gardner in the
Davidson College Studio The-
ater. ‘

She has directed five of
her own plays and has gone
throughout the United States
speaking at college and the-
ater conferences. When she
made her visit to Davidson,
she spoke about the signifi-
cance of the audience
member’s relationship with
theater.

Both her distinct style and
unusual demeanor added to
the whole experience of her
presentation and reflected the
comic quirkiness of her plays.

You can tell when a play has
been written by Joan Schenkar,
and that is because I have a certain
attitude toward the work and a
certain style in my genes. I believe
it’s genetic.

In fact can’t write a play until
I’ ve found the style and form. Style
is far more important than sub-
stance despite everything people
have told you. You can always
judge a book by its cover.

Jones Meadows: My plays
are all different. I always have
some sort of spiritual being in there,
no doubt. I think it is always an
experience for me.

My first challenge was, “Can
I write a play?” So, I wrote a play.
Next it was, “Can I write a play
with seven characters and have
them interact?” and then, “Can I
write a play with two characters
and not have them bore the audi-
ence to death?”

Ijustcame out ofaone-woman
play which I think was the hardest

‘thing. It’s the play that I love the

most. It was the most difficult to
write, but I think it’s got the most
experimental style.

Idon’tlike “experimental the-
ater” particularly. I find a lot of
shock value in it, and that’s not
what I’m interested in. I’m not
against commercial theater. I think
commercial means appealing to
the masses of people. You want to
write so that two million people
will be affected by it, and you want
to write to create a wholeness and
a sense of belonging in a commu-
nity; if only for 20 minutes. I think
it is important for artists not to
become elitist and say, “I’m an
artist, and most people don’t un-

derstand me because I’m so deep.”

Iexperiment with the psychol-
ogy of people. I’m willing to talk
about and write about characters
who delve into deeper aspects of
themselves than we are comfort-
able with.

What makes your work

unique?.. How is your work a
reflection of you?

Schenkar: I write, specifically,

comedies’ of menace. Usually, I
deal with subjects that are so dan-
gerous and painful that they can
only be accessed by laughter.

In fact, on a good night, I can
make people laugh at things that
are so horrible they could have no
other response but to go nuts.

I also think that the kind of ©
comedy I write is rather special.
The kind of comedy I write is more
like tragedy viewed at a distance.

Jones Meadows: I think it’s
that I decided early on that I did not
live right. There was something in
life that was missing. So, I started
exploring different religions, spiri-
tualities, meditations, and astrol-
ogy and kinds of things that inform
life at a level that we are not con-
scious of.

That’s in the plays. That’s the
Karen hand in there. If we just deal
with physical, mental, and emo-
tional things, our intuition and other
things that guide us every day are
missing.
