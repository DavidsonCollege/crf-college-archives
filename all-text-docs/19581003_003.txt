Sports
All That

By JIM HAMILTON

Friday night I walked out of the library and headed
toward the Union.

Then (he quiet night air was pierced by an un-;

THE DAVIDSONIAN

familiar voice on a loud speaker that observed, ‘Der he ”

go's, fo five yards around da end.”

What it was, was football, one of the local
colored high school games that Davidson is fortu-
nate enough to have played on her field.

I by-passed the stud and, aided by a push, serambled’
over the fence around Richardson field.

Biggest Fan

The announcer, undoubtably the biggest fan in;

the stadium, was giving a running account of the gamie, |
complete with a-personal touch.

“Der quarterback is goin to pass. tosses it to der:
end. + uh oh, he dropped it. He don't want no part of dal’

all.”

The quarterback on the white team faded back and
threw a short pass down the middle. Number 42 for the
blues intercepted. and legged it toward the sidelines.

After a brief jaunt he was halted by an unnum-

bered player in white who grabbed him by the shoul-
der pads and the chin strap. After 42 hit the ground,
the boy in white let go of the shoulder pads, but
not the chin strap. An extra jerk and off it came.

A quick sleight of hand that Mr. Shaw Smith would
have been proud of, and the chin strap was in his pants.
42 held the game up for a minute prodding around in

the grass looking for Wis strap, then with a quizzical ex-
pression, walked back to the huddle.

Cheerleaders

The cheerleaders, twelve of them. took this oppor-
tunity to admonish their team to “fight, fight, fight.” A

younger group of students, only half interested since]

their team was ahead by twenty points, gathered in a.
far corner and began serenading the audience with every-'

sa

Flickerball Play
Begins I-F Sports

Inclement weather hampered the beginning of in-

thing from “Rocking Robin” to “It’s me, ‘its me, it’s me.|tramural competition on the flickerball fields this week.

oh Lord. standing in the treed of prayer.”
Play was back’ in progress and the blue team

attempted an end run. The down marker bearer,
seeing twenty-two players rampaging in his direc-
tion, proved he was the fastest man on the field, by
grabbing his marker and ovtrunning all of them
to safety.

Attention again shifted from the playing field as
the above mentioned group of choraleers leaned over
the edge of the stadium to watch big Joe Milner pull his
extensive anatomy over the barbed-wire fence. The big-
gest cheer of the evening went up when he finally gained
entrance.

No Time For Football

Play was still in progress, but the clock had ceased
to operate. “Hey, reffree,” the announcer quizzed, “You
got yo watch, der clock done stopped.”

Just then a player in white caught a long pass and
the announcer exclaimed, “Who dat, who dat with der
ball. Uh-oh, five yard penalty against der white team.
What's dis,efive yard penalty against the blue team—
dats five fo five, not five by five, but five fo five.”

The whites scored and the game eventually
ended after what amounted to about a twenty min-

ute fourth quarter since nobody really knew how
much time was actually left.

The players streamed off the field. and I walked
toward the gate.

As I looked back, the last thing I saw was Number
42 looking for his chin strap.

However, an important step was taken toward a better
clarification of many aspects in the intramural program
for the year.

Tuesday night, at a meeting
in the gymnasium of represent-
atives from the fraternities and
independants, the Intramural
Athletic Council (IMAC) was es-
tablished. This was principally
an organizational meeting and
several committees were
formed which were instructed
to begin functioning immediate-
ly.

These committces of the
IMAC will be concerned with
writing a constitution, rules
and regulations of intramural
competion, a calendar of the

‘year’s intramural activities, and

record. of intramural standings.
It. is the council's intention to
have the constitution and the
body of intramural rules out-
lined within the next two weeks
and ready for presentation to
the fraternities at their Oct. 16
meeings.

Coach Joe Hunt was
elected a voting member of
the IMAC and his term will
be determined in the new
constitution.

The flickerbatt title,

last year by the KA'’s, hould

taken

be a wide open race this year
and a large number of clos
contests are anticipated. At the
end. of the flickerball season
there is a prospect of. a game
between the champions of the
league and “an all-star team
composed of: top players from
the other participating teams.

Members of the student body
ate reminded to check the bul-

Race record breaker, is the Kit-

and a half mile circuit. He set
a state record in last year’s
prep meet, reeling off the mile
in 4:29 at Chapel Hill. The
frosh squad also includes Mack
Brownlee. 11. M. Jones, Dave
Page. Ran Schaffner, F J Wal-
ters, Larry Kinney, and Bill
Coffey.

The Wildcats travel to Wake
Forest next week to meet the
Deacons on Wednesday, Octo-
ber 8. Davidson's lineup then
will probably be the same as -to-
day's.

More people are loyal to Camels than
any other cigarette today. It stands to
reason: the best tobacco. makes the
best smoke. The Camel blend of costly
tobaccos has never been equalled for
rich flavor and easygoing mildness. No
wonder Camel is the No. 1 cigarette
of all brands today!

Coach J W. McCutchan com
mented. “Pfeiffer is stronger
this year, with more experience
and some promising material.
They have dropped football and

have put major emphasis on
soccer. It will be a good hard
game but we hope to bring
back a victory.”

The team is rounding into
shape and. aecording to Coach
McCutchan, the veterans are

looking very good. There is a

Neville will be shifted to -half-
back for.
pending the return of Pete An-
drews. Andrews,
halfback last’ year. is out tem-)
porarily due to illness, but is
expected to be back in action
soon.

New foreign students, Ul-

rich Schoening, Wiecher
Bergsma, and Hermon
Laimer are showing up

well. McCutchan added that
Tom Price and Ward Mc-
Keithan will greatly bolster
the fine with their experi-
enced play and that the re-
turn of Tom Johnson
should give added strength
to the team. Lint Hopkins
and ‘‘Koogie’ Kwon also
were mentioned by Coach
MeCutchan as having evi-
denced excellent form in
practice.

With only two Josses by grad
uation and with a bevy of ex-
perienced players | returning.
the coach expects to havo an
above par season. Already he
is looking ahead io the Duke
game here on Octuber 10 lie
expressed the opinion that Dyke
always has a strong game and
that this first home game
should be a thriller.

Scolt Turns Down
Position In Haiti

The little country of. Haiti
came close to receiving the ser-
vices of Davidson's Athletic Di-
rector, Dr. Tom Scott. The State
Department requested Coach
Scott to go to the Latin Ameri-
can country to become General
Sports Organizer.

The duties of this position are
to organize a basketball and

track teams to represent Haiti| §

in several athletic games held
around the world. The first of
the events would be the Car-
ribbean games held in South
America in November.

Next the teams would repre-
sent Haiti in the Pan-American
games heid in Chicago in. the
coming year. Also the team
would go to the Olympic games
held in Rome, Italy in 1960.

The work that went along
with the position would have
taken a great dcal of time. Due
to this. Coach Seott had to de-!
cline the offer.

“I greatly appreciated the of,
fer. "Scott said, “but duc to other
commitments here at Davidson
I had to decline. It gives me a
good fecling to know that 1 was
considered for the position, and
I would have liked to have seen
the Olympic games.”

only major loss from the Bull-
dog ranks is that of Ajl-Confer-

Freshmen

The Freshman edition of the '58 Wildcats played their

only home game here this afternoon against Fork Union

possibility that captain Gordon!

The young ’Cats made their

debut in an. 18-9 loss to Furman
at Greenville last Friday.

POOR SECOND HALF

Davidson was knocked out of
the scoring column in the sec-
ond half after leading 9-6 at
jthe end of the second quarter. |
Davidson led off the scoring |
with a field goal by Bruce.
;Usher. Furman failed to move}
the ball and the Cats took over |
again. Quarterback Sam Jack-;
son then hit Duncan Morton,
an end, with-a pass to make the
jseore 9-0. The conversion’ at-

tempt was no good.

The Purple Hurricane frosh
cut. down the’ lead. to three;

they scored a

before the halffime break. The| of Bennettesville, McRorie from

each of the Iw of the two final quarters. |sidered to be rich in potential.

They failed to make a conver-
sion.

Coach Tom Stevens men-
tioned the line play of cen-
ter Bruce Usher and guard
Buddy Rives, as being gar-
ticularly outstanding and
was also pleased with the
running of halfbacks Grant
McRorie and Lynwood Mal-
lard. Stevens’ twenty-eight
man squad used the same
offensive and defensive pat-
terns initiated by head foot-
bali coach Bill Dole.
