THE DAVIDSONIAN, MARCH 28, 1934

Art Lecture Given
In Chapel Tuesday

Speaker Outlines History of Carl
Schurz Foundation

Mrs. Johnsen, the representative of
the Carl Schurz Memorial Foundation,
who is making lectures on the exhibit
of German etchings and engravings
now being shown in the banquet hall
of Chambers, made a talk on this
foundation in chapel on Tuesday morn-
ing, March 20. Mrs. Johnsen was in-
troduced by Guy R. Vowles, professor
of German.

Mrs. Johnsen started her talk by
briefly outlining the life of Carl
Schurz, for whom the memorial fund
is named. “Carl Schurz,” she said,
“was born in Germany, but after re-
ceiving an education here, he was
forced to leave because of a revolu-
tion.

“He came to America and became
very influential in American politics.
He was sent as ambassador to Spain
by Lincoln in 1861 and during the Civil
War served as a major general in the
Union Army. After the war he served
as the editor of several of the coun-
try’s leading papers until he died in
1906.

“The aim of the Carl Schurz Me-
morial Fund is to establish better cul-
tural relations between America and
German - speaking countries,” | Mrs.
Johnsen continued. “ The initial amount
of this fund was $500,000; this was to
be spent for the exchange of students,
professors, and lecturers between the
two countries.

“To this has been added the Ober-|tertained their dates and friends at a Choral:

gency Relief Administration in Wash-
ington.

the, past several weeks on various im-
provements on the college grounds, do-
ing mainly general Work on the cam-
pus and the golf course. They have
also been helping in some of the extra
painting on several of the buildings.

were selected by a committee com-
posed of faculty members, with espe-
cial regard to the neediness of the stu-
dents. According to the rules of the
administration, one-fourth of the men
must be from the ranks of the new
men, and, since only five men applied

Many Varied Services
Given by Deputations

The “Y” deputation last week con-
sisted of the regular service held at the
Y. M. C. A. building in Charlotte for
younger boys and a non-“Y” group
which conducted the services at Myers
Park Presbyterian Church in Charlotte
Sunday afternoon at 5:30.
A. B, Rhodes gave the address at
the Myers Park Church; P. M. Kirk-
patrick read the scripture; Bill Link
rendered a violin solo, and Doug Wal-
ker acted as organist. Rhodes’ address
was based on the inscription over the
Cross at the Crucifixion, “Jesus of
Nazareth, King of the Jews,” which
was written. in Hebrew, Greek, and
Latin. The failure of these three lan-
guages to be great without Christian
doctrine was brought out. -
Another deputation left Monday for
Duke University and there conducted
services before the Y. W. C. A. group.
Rufus Morrow delivered the addréss,
and Dave McLain sang. Sam Wiley
and Walter Sprunt, president-elect of
the Davidson Y. M. C. A., also com-
posed the deputation.

Psychology Class Will
Start Practical Work

Dr. Hood’s class in the psychology
of salesmanship and advertising are be-
ginning to do practical work in the
writing of advertisements. The class
will appreciate an opportunity to pre-
pare slogans or appeals for any special

the campus.

In addition to the writing of adver-
tisements, the class is making a com-
parison between the advertisements of
today and those of ten years ago. The
result of this study is that advertise-
ments today depend upon skillful ex-
pression and less on size and flaring
colors, The class is now Participating
in a research in the psychology of the
types of advertising that get results.
The results of this research will be an-
nounced at some future date.

Prof. Thies Represents
College at. Convention
Professor Oscar Julius Thies, asso-

Literary Societies

PHILANTHROPIC

Resolved: That college education is
out of adjustment with modern life,
was argued at the meeting of the Phil-
anthropic Literary Society Tuesday
night. Arguing affirmatively were Al-
bert Harper and C. D, Dean; negative-
ly, John McMullan and T. D. Mullis.

The affirmative argued that college
education was turning out too many
white-collar workers who are unwill-
ing to start at the bottom and conse-
quently filled the ranks of the unem-
ployed. Modern college education as
a whole, said the affirmative speakers,
is not paying enough attention to the
basic industries—agriculture, dairying,
and manufacturing—is turning out a
surplus of professional men and tech-
nicians who find no market for their
labors, and thus is not aiding human
welfare.

The negative speakers argued that
a college education was necessary to
get the best well-balanced outlook on
life. By giving a more general edu-
cation the college aids the student in
choosing his occupation. Finally, the
negative argued that in this mile-a-
minute world, college education is
needed to preserve culture.

EUMENEAN

A talk by Bob Lindsay on “Inter-
esting English Idioms,” a talk by Ralph
McClelland on the discovery of new
archaeological discoveries and a hu-
yMorous recitation by B. L. Rose was
the order of the program at the meet-
ing of the Eumenean Literary Society
Tuesday night.

Lindsay, in his philological discourse,
picked numerous “key words” in the
English language and showed what va-
rious and different meanings were pos-
sible for each word. In a few minutes
he demonstrated to the society the
great flexibility of the English lan-
guage.

The discovery, by aviators of a
Sabean city in Southern Arabia was
the topic of McClelland’s talk, The
aviators reported that the ruins were
well preserved and: are ‘larger than
those of Babylon. McClelland pointed
out that this discovery could have great
effect on historians who might be en-
abled to discover a new civilization.

FIRING AT RANDOM

(Continued from page 3)

a year or so ago, Bob was an ama-
teur and one of the best in this
part of the south. Recently he has
turned pro and has given instruc-
tion in his off time. Teddy Bur-
well and Lenoir Wright, who have
starred in tournaments over the
country, are two of his proteges.
Coach Doc Newton has given his
services to the men who are in-
terested in golf. He is conducting
a class in the fundamentals of the
game, and men who are interested
in this sport are urged to come out
and get what benefit they can
from this free instruction. Tennis
and golf are two sports which will
last a man out into life; and for
this reason, it would be a good
idea to be able to participate in
them with at least a small degree
of skill. Get your racquet or your
clubs and take advantage of this
free instruction which the college
offers.

With the holidays peeping around
the corner, and spring fever in every-
body’s blood, there is nothing to do
but wish one and all a happy vacation
and safe, speedy (?) return.
