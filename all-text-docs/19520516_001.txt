BY PROCLAMATION: -

BAREFOOT DAY SEES
CAMPUS GO NATIVE

Tuesday, the twentieth of May, has been declared
Barefoot Day by lenience of those who declare such things
and all customs, regulations, mores and eccentricities nor-
mally associated with the observance of such occasion, will
be unscrupulously followed by faculty. administration
and students: furthermore, everybody will go barefoot.

This declaration is not without justification and ra-
tionalization: furthermore, there’s a reason for it. Five. in
fact.

To wit, Barefoot Day is declared:

1) as evidence of our maturity; 2) To help the
farmers, since it is sure to rain if such an occasion has been
planned; 3) To save embarrassment to ROTC students who
have turned in the ROTC shoes they have been wearing all
year by making everyone look’ the same: 4) To squash
ants: 5) To make a good impression on visitors.

Furthermore this significant occasion is duly pro-
claimed by the following:

PROCLAMATION

Whereas, nature in her kindness has sent us the season of
spring again, and

Whereas, many human beings at one time or another ex-
perience a back-to-nature urge. and

Whereas, it is well for young men becoming burdened with
the responsibilities of modern living to remember from
time to time the carefree days of childhood, and

Whereas. the faculty has become accustomed to looking for-
ward to this annual treat of getting a view of the
students’ feet,

I. therefore, by what authority I do not know, hereby
designate Tuesday, May 20, 1952, as STUDENT
BAREFOQT DAY on the Davidson campus.

hart, and H. N. Cannon.

The tapping followed a talk by
Mr. John Payne of the Public Re-
lations Department, who spoke on
the Davidson of yesterday and that
of today, bringing out- the need for
such an: organization as ODK in
the awakening of the student body.

ODK has three purposes. The
first is to recognize who have
attained a high standard of ef-
ficiency in collegiate activities;
the second is to bring together
the most representative men in
all phases of collegiate life; and
the third is to bring together
members of the faculty and
student body of the institution
on a basis of mutual interest
and understanding.

The society stresses five major

phases of campus life, including
achievement in scholarship, ath-
letics, social and religious affairs,
publications, speech, music and
dramatic arts. In accordance with
scholarship, it is necessary for every
candidate for -ODK to be in the
upper thirty-five per cent of his
class.

Emphasis is placed on the de-
velopment of a well-rounded
man, and the five indispensa-
ble qualifications for member-
ship are. character, leadership
and service in campus life,

scholarship, fellowship, and
consecration to democratic
ideals,

Profs Win Again
In Near Shut-Out

By HUNTER. STRADER

This week the faculty again
proved its athletic superiority over
the best that the graduating class
could offer in three out of four
events. This was the usual result
of Davidson College’s annual
Senior-Faculty Day, for the profes-
sors have proved themselves peren-
nial champions on the athletic field.

In the golf match the faculty
doubled the senior’s score, winning
by 26-13. Team scores for the aft-
ernoon action were as follows:
White and Jones over Rhodes and
Groseclose, 8% to %; Carr and Bal-
lenger over Parker and Fetzer, 6%
to 24%; McGavock and Davis over
Brooks and Smith, 9 to 0; Sutton
and Talbert over Woods and Work-
man, 6 to 3.

The military was much in
the limelight on the links as

score that more than made up

Eberhardt Tribe
To Stampede West

Once again the call of far away places has beckoned to Dr.
Charles R. Eberhardt. This summer the Bible professor is plan-
ning a trip through the western part of our country, but not
alone. His entire family will accompany him in an aluminum
“tent’’ which is actually a shell made up to Dr. Eberhardt’s

specifications.

‘The Eberhardts’ will leave Da-
vidson on June 5 and travel to New
York where they will spend a few
days. They plan to teave New
York on June 10 and take a north-
vrn route to the West, through the
upper northern. states. The trip is
not one enirtly of pleasure, for
Dr. Eberhardt will stop, at semi-
naries and colleges along the way.
While in Michigan the Eberhardts
will be the guests of Dr. George A.
Buttrick, who delivered the bacca-
laureate address at Davidson three
years ago. ,

Dr. Eberhardt stressed that

he and his family would not

stop at the “conventional”

tourist spots, although Little

Big Horn, Custer’s last stand,

and Yosemite National Park

are on his list.

While on the West Coast, Dr.
Eberhardt will fill several speak-
ing engagements. Sonietime in Aug-
ust the Eberhardts will leave the
coast to return to their home. They
will come East via a southern route
so as to see that part of the coun-
try which they missed on the way
to the West.
