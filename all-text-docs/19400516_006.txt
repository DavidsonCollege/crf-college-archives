C. Morgan

Is Vesper Speaker

Concord Minister Says That
Man Should Deny Himself
For Christ

Dr. Frank Crosley Morgan, new-
ly elected pastor of the First Pres-
byterian Church of Concord, “was
the guest minister at the vespers
service Sunday evening, May 12.

The text of Dr. Morgan's sermon
was taken from two verses of scrip-
ture in the eight chapter of Mark,
verses thirty-one and _ thirty-four.
He compared and discussed the dif-

ferent subjects dealt with in these

verses under three separate out-
fines.

Sermon
“The Son of man must. suffer
many things and“ be rejected by

the elders;” so is man today under

many of the pressing problems and

difficulties of: the world. He ex-
pressed the idea that one must
undertake these hinderances even

though a great many luxuries may
have to be given up.
Dr. Morgan explained that it would
be necessary for people to “take
up their cross” and follow the
Christian ways of life. Even though
the way may be full of bi-ways
and stones, the goal will be more
than life can offer—Jesus “Christ
as our guiding star and goal.
Conclusion

In conclusion, Dr. Morgan il-
lustrated that to find or gain the
main theme of our religious cus-
toms, one would have to have a
clear understanding of the principle
stoties and theories which appear
throughout the Holy Bible.
