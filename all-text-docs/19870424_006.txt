Tin Men: an excursion into Baltimore’s dreamy past

By BRUCE PLOURDE

Do you remember thinking to
yourself, “A movie about deten-
tion on Saturday? Who are they
kidding?” And yet we:learned that
The Breakfast Club dealt with
much more than detention hall.
Likewise for Tin Men. A movie
about aluminum-siding salesmen

. doesn’t exactly bring to mind im-
ages of Indiana Jones. Yet from
the very start the film engages our
human interest.

The tale takes place in the Bal-
timore of the early 1960s. The
motif of tin, metal and the like ap-
pear in every aspect of the film

Bachelor Party’ strange equity: both sexes stripped of dignity

By FLORENCE SNIVELY

Are you looking for a good
belly-laugh you can. take home
‘with you and remember at odd
times? Bachelor Party supplies a
two-hour series of adolescent gig-
gles, but lacks a central, amusing
punch.

Rick Gasko (Tom Hanks), the
main character, is introduced as a
school bus driver with a not-very-
well-suppressed desire to be a
standup comic. Everything feeds
his comic impulses, creating an
endless stream of mildly amusing
one-liners. His goal in life is to

make people look like the fools _

they are. This is very effective —
nuns continue to berate him for
irresponsibility and for his flip at-
titude, his fiancee’s parents en-
courage other suitors to Keep try-
ing two weeks before the wed-
ding.

and unifies the subplots. The
frame structure follows the tin
salesmen and their various wily
schemes to sell aluminum siding
to- reluctant homeowners. The
ploys they devise rely heavily on
the salesman’s cunning and ability
to judge a prospective’s psycholo-
gical reactions. Selling aluminum
becomes a game of wits, and the
players pride themselves on their
prowess. They sport their tail-fin-
ned Cadillacs as a symbol of their
success.

The Cadillacs, in fact, bring
together the two most important
tin men in the story. Richard

-Rick. Gasko is a decent guy
despite what the rest mainstream
humanity thinks; he does not
laugh at people trying to commit
suicide. When his fiancee tells
him of her worries, he comforts
her. The combination has strange
results: Rick Gasko comes off as
Honest Abe Lincoln — with a
genital fixation.

Debbie Thompson (Tawny
Kitaen), his fiancee, is the straight

man in this comedy routine. Her:

world is funny; the fitting-rooms
at the botique where she works are
missing something (doors), her
father’s (George Grizzard) inap-
propriate, grown-up-preppy be-
havior is missing something
(maturity, a sense of humor). De-
bbie herself is missing something:
depth of personality. She is a
whining nincompoop. How could
she possibly doubt Rick’s devo-
tion to her? If she cannot see past

Dreyfuss purchases his new fin-
ned metallic-blue Caddie and
backs out of the dealership. Half--
way into the street Danny DeVito,
driving his symbol of success,
smashes into the side of his new
car. Both men leap out and accuse
the other of idiocy. They vow to
even the score, and spend the rest
of the movie trying to do so, es-
calating the retribution at every
turn.

Both men have entirely dispic-
able sides to their nature. Yet both
men have a warm, likeable side as
well. As their hatred toward each
other increases, the audience can’t

Rick’s compulsive entertainment,
why is she planning to marry him?
To her cousin, she says, “I trust

Rick,” but her behavior shows —

otherwise. ;
Reality is further complicated
by the existence of Cole Whittier
(Robert Prescott), preppy dream-
boy, Debbie’s former boyfriend.
Cole’ is extremely attractive, ex-
tremely rich, and is still going
through intellectual puberty. He

‘cannot understand why, if he has

his father’s consent to marry De-
bbie, he should need hers as well.
Cole wanders through — the
slapstick finding things to trade
for Debbie, like a small boy who
found the wrong hot-wheels car in
his cereal box. When this fails he
resorts to extremely mature and
well planned subterfuge.

The plot of the movie is com-
plex: Rick promises Debbie he
won't have sex at his bachelor

help but feel that if only the one
could see the other's side they
would not hate each other so. This
dramatic irony provides the op-
portunity for them to reveal-both
sides of their characters.

Apart from the central conflict
between Dreyfuss and DeVito,

. the verity of the portrayal of city

life adds to the appeal of Tin Men.
Brief glimpses and caught .frag-
ments of conversation illuminate
the joy and vigor of the everyday
passage of time. Although most of

_the tin men talk with hackneyed

voices and expressions, DeVito
often shows a tendency to use an

party. Blinked? Too bad, you
missed it. That’s all you get. The
movie degenerates into a kind of
one-upmanship contest between
the men at the bachelor party and
the women at the bridal shower:
how can the women get revenge
on the men; how can the men best
forget they are still (loosely de-
fined) thinking creatures?

Unlike other light-hearted
sex-flicks, Bachelor Party does
not demean women because it
shows them as handy carrying-
cases for sexual equipment.
Bachelor Party gives men and
women equal time in the demean-
ing department. If women come to
the party to show off their breasts,
the men do no better at the male
strip joint the women visit.

Neither gender is left any dignity.
It is arefreshing change to watcha -
movie that, as a new twist on old
morality, considers the entire

almost-Tidewater accent, music
amongst cacophony. His friends
talk incessantly about how inane
Hoss and Little Joe seem on
Bonanza. The director has taken
care to show the sweetest morsels
of life in Baltimore in the era fol-
lowing McCarthyism.

One cannot put this movie un-
questionably into one class. It has’
elements of comedy and drama in
it, yet it is not totally either.
Perhaps the best way to categorize
Tin Men is to join it to the likes of
movies such as Diner and Ameri-
can Grafitti. For an excursion into
the dreamy past, see Tin Men.

human race handy carrying-cases
for sexual equipment. Maybe.

Still in all, Bachelor Party is
sort of: amusing. If you’re not
looking for a meaningful relation-
ship with a movie, it’s probably
worth some time. Possibly the
most fun you’ Il have all evening is
reading the credits; they had to
work pretty hard to distinguish in
a phrase which of the two-
thousand bit-parts was which. But
if, (Oh horror and personal con-
demnation) you abandon your
Davidson IQ and that. desperate
thirst for academic knowledge to
cut loose and exercise those most-
denied parts of your mature and
repressed personality, stop by for
any half-hour of Bachelor Party.
Heaven forbid, you might be en-
tertained.

Bachelor Party will be shown.
at 9:45 p.m. on Friday in the 900
