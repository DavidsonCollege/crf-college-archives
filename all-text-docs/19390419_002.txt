Dry Cleaning Politics

From our exchange it is purely evident

that Davidson is not the only college around
that is having trouble with her election sys-
tem. Below is an editorial from a well-
known collegiate sheet.

Politics aren't kept clean by being wash-
ed, They must be thoroughly aired at least
once annually.

Realizing that, Phi Gamnia literary so-
ciety is holding an open meeting Monday
at which students will get to cross examine
candidates tor the presidency of the stu-
dent body. The society hopes to promote
balloting on the basis of stands on issues
and qualifications of candidates, instead of
pefsonalities, and political webs.

Perhaps, also, too. many elections in the
past have been lost through sabotage of
defeated candidates. Such a method of cam-
paigning has been widely employed. The
meeting Manday will encourage a more
straight-forward approach. Merits of can-
didates will be compared in a healthy fash-
ion, while alleged personal inabilities will be
left in the closet.

The campus will not ondy get to find
how candidates feel about matters at hand.
It will be able to discover just how much
the hopefuls know about the campus gov-
ernment. No lark is in store for the candi-
dates, but if they're solid material, they can
take it.

It is certainly encouraging that candi-
dates this year are announcing themselves,
instead of arranging to be pushed into it by
fraternities. This fact, along with the Phi
Gamma discussion meeting, indicates that
campus politics are becoming less political
and more democratic.

Frankly, The Wheel would like to see
still more politics drawn from fraternity
house libraries and handled in a man-to-
man fashion in outdoor mass meetings.
sonfires and stump speeches can help of-
fice aspirants. And they’re a lot of fun.

And This!

Also, from
information

reliable comes the

that members of the
student body will stoop so low as to “swipe”
ballots. Each and every member of the stu-
dent body has a right to vote and a right to
have that tabulated. A person, who
sees that the ballot cast by the man sit-
ting next to him in chapel is not in favor
of his man, and then deliberately takes this
ballot, puts it in. his pocket and carries it
out, doesn’t stop to think. He may be de-
priving some worthy candidate of an of-
‘fice in ate cases, while on the other hand
it may not! affect the final results, but by
all means, it is a nasty situation, and
should be stopped. A remedy for this might
be to put ballot boxes in the rear of chapel
and let each voter drop his ballot in the box.
These two evils are the biggest of our pres-
ent balloting system. Why not wipe them
out before they go too far?

Flaws

While of the students are
cerning themselves about Davidson's pol-
icy in regard to elections, little do they
realize that there is a practice carried on by
some students that is definitely “unbecom-

,

known as “absentee balloting,” has no place

tem. Whether the students advocate open

“Social institutions change whether one

social problems while in college will be more
likely to adjust himself to such changes
when they occur, and will be less indanger
ot being captivated by a shallow demogogue,
than he who has never been compelled to
evaluate conflicting arguments.” A Harv-
ard University faculty committee cites an-
other great reason for complete academic
freedom,

“Great books represent the work of the
human mind in its highest quality, as well
as in relation to its most significant themes.
One of the greatest educational influences
is found in this closeness of contact with the

leaders in human intelligence. Teaching
rests largely in the hope that greatness of
mind may be contagious.” Dr, Alexander

Meiklejohn, former University of Wisconsin
professor, believes that ‘unless we develop
a thinking, intelligent, well-read public, our
democracy will fail.”

“We have no choice, if we love liberty
and respect individual worth, other than to
place behind the Christian colleges of Amer-
ica the full strength of our resources, both
material and spiritual. The body politic is
in constant and sore need of the leavening
influence that from these institu-
tions.” Nebraska’s Senator Burke argues
that college should graduate students “firm-
ly grounded in the fundamentals of Amer-
icanism.”

flows

The Oberlin College Review stated the
current position of the college newspaper
editorial writers in this way: “We cannot
censure too severely the weak-kneed bow-
ing and scraping and the magnanimous sac-
rifices of other peoples which the French
and English governments~have~ made. So
long as the desire for peace and our own
security is uppermost in our minds, we can
hardly hope that more will come out of the
rumored four-power to stop
Hitler than more guarantees.”

conference

Many collegians predict that the latest
moves of Der Fuehrer are steps in the di-
rection of his downfall. The University of
Baltimore Baloo states this position in this
way: “For the first time since the beginning
of the Third Reich Germany has seized for-
eigners and not Germans. Germany now has
a strong, exceedingly brave minority within
its own borders, Any further advance will
bring more foreigners. The first step to-
ward Germany’s downfall has been taken,
but watch the future.”

Thurs.-Fri., April 20-21

ee YY,
“BROADWAY SERENADE’—
Jeanette MacDonald, Lew Ayres,

Frank Morgan, and ‘Rita Johnson.

A rather old plot dressed up in
a brand new way with the wife-
singer and husband-player com-
bination. The wife—Jeanette Mac-
Donald is recognized and contin-
ues up the ladder to’ sensational
success, but the husband, Lew
Ayres, flops miserably. A male
companion enters the welcome

heart of the wife and a divorce fol-
lows. He becomes a composer, and
she sings his songs, and well you
can figure out the rest. But Mac-
Donald's rendition of “Broadway
Serenade” and” “Magic Melody”
and others are well worth hearing.

“BOY SLAVES’—Anne Shirley,
Roger Daniel and James McCal-
lion.

If you are a born and bred re-
former you'll probably love this
picture: With cold anger it chooses
the Deep South as the locale and
paints a brutal picture of child la-
bor as it is supposed to exist. Anne
Shirley, James McCallion and Rog-
er Daniel all do exceptional work
in morbid characterizations.

“THE FLYING IRISHMAN’—
Douglas Corrigan and Eddie Quil-
lan.

In this Doug (Wrong-way) Cor-
rigan wears his plain leather jacket
and a charming smile to fascinate
theatre-goers in portraying the
story of his life. He has three fat-
ial expressions: low—which  sig-
nifies dejection at the many tough
breaks life brings him, medium—
which is when he is flying, and
| high—when he smiles. That smile
does something to your heart when
you see it.

The plot is not unusual, because
Corrigan’s life has been primarily
one of hard work. The climax: is
when foolhardy desperation takes
place of relaxed ambition. He works
hard for a mere pittance, all the
while sending his brother to col-
lege, but successive disappoint-
ments do not dismay the fighting
Irishman, not even when his plane
is ruined by a crackpot ex-war
ace. Of course his brother helps in
the expedition.

“NEVER~ SAY DIE”—Martha
Raye, Bob Hope, Bette Davis, An-
dy Devine.

While Bette Davis completed her
eight months of remaining life,
Bob Hope, on another screen, is
told he has only one month to live,
because he is hyper-acid and is go-
ing to digest himself. It is all a
mistake, but Bob doesn’t think so,
and neither does Martha Raye,
the Texas heiress who marries him
to escape being sold in wedlock to
a Prince. Then at this point Andy
Devine, Martha’s home-town true-
love, appears in the Swiss town
where this all happens, and you
are treated to the highly comical
situation of a couple on a honey-
moon with a fiance in attendance.
Naturally it is confused, but out of
the chaos Bob manages to pull
a succession of funny gags.

Martha Raye is less boisterous in
this than usual, and the hilarious-
ness of the picture furnishes two
hours of relaxation and entertain-
ment. :

SUPER SNOOPINGS

By KEN LAWSON

Call it madness or call it Spring
breezes, but there is just something
about this time of year that makes
every college man exercise his
three inailiable rights—life, liberty,
and the pursuit of women, Which
of these two things it is we can-
not say after seeing TOM Mc-
LEAN and PHYSICAL ED MOR-

ROW leaving on another tour of |

Concord and vicinity Sunday night
accompanied by two of Davidson
College's fairest. Spring must real-

|ly be here when SAM HEMPHILL

can bear all the scathing remarks
on baseball tour last week-end and
still appear at Converse Saturday
night to see his O-A-O “Pony.”

I just can’t help stealing a little
thunder from the Sports Dept. and
mentioning that the greatest news

of last week-end in the realm of |

athletics was choosing of the red.
and blue ball teams. Concerted ac-
tion by these groups, led by John
Latimer who barely missed out on

that the reds and blue prefer hard

SWING ON THE DECLINE...
Dr. George Gallup, in an “excursion
into popular tastes,” on “Do you
like Swing Music?’ finds that there
are some inevitable signs that swing
music has reached its peak with
the American public, and that it is
now on the decline. For two years,
jitterbugging has been a common
sight in dance rooms, and for a
fad, that is an extraordinary long
time. In August, the poll shows,
62 per cent answered YES to the
query, while 38 per cent said NO.
Today, 56 per cent say YES, and
44 per cent answer NO. But still
in the larger cities, 74 per cent
of the persons under 30 like their
music hot, while in contrast to
that, only 35 per cent of the peo-
ple over 50 like swing music. The
typical “oldster” complains that “it
Was alright until they started

Southerners, 63 per cent in favor
of swing, are more enthusiastic
than the rest of the country.
