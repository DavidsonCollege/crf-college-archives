A Treat Coming.
Hugh Smith has promised to give
in one of his love letters for pub-
lication next week.

Hudson White visited the coun-
try. He discovered a covey of pigs,
called the chickens “kitty” and
wanted to know if when a horse
was single-footing it kept just one
foot on the ground at a tine.

Take a cake of soap and quart of
ink,

Dump together in a kitchen sink,

Add some scraps of bone and meat

1 Bits of gristle and six pigs feet,

Stir around for an hour anda
quarter,

With choice, selected, hot dish
water,

Season well with a peck of trash,
And behold! Delicious, tempting
hash.

R. O. T. C. NEWS.

The twenty men who are to com-
pose our gallery competition team

men will take part in the Depart-
ment contest to be held the last of
April, and will back up our chal-
lenge to Wofford College.

The International
Company has signified its willing-
ness to take pictures of our R. O
T. C. activities, and to publish them
in the weekly Review. This offer

{will probably not be taken advan-

tage of until next fall, but every
man is urged to help make David-
son drill worth putting in the
movies.

The last military formation of
the year, which is tg take place
May tenth, will be a farewell
parade in honor of the Seniors. All
Seniors, whether R. O. T. C. men
or not, will stand in the reviewing
line with Col. Meuller, while the
battalion passes in review.

A full-pack inspection is to come
off during the last week. Students
should have all their: equipment at
hand and their rifles in excellent
condition at this time, as all articles
are to be turned in immediately
after the inspection.
