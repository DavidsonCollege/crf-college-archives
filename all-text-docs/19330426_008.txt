Boy From Fayetteville Has Strange

By GEORGE GULLETTE

And so a new staff of editors have shifted
into the machine that is responsible for
putting out The Davidsonian, Fairly reek-
ing with new ideas, these men have applied
themselves to making the paper better every
weck, and for one point they intend to give
a more personal touch to it. Nothing, of
course, is more personal than to speak of
the personalities themselves.

Here at Davidson we should .all know
each other. Oftentimes there are some here
whom we would like to know but unfor-
tunately do.not. I intend to pick out some
of the outstanding personalities of the cam-
pus, and in case you do not know them, here
you may meet them. Nor shall I write of
them necessarily in the order of their im-
portance. But while realizing that neither
the world’s recognition, nor the applause
of men is of necessity the insignia of true
character, nevertheless it is most fitting that
I should first give an account of your awn
choice as leader.

JEROME B. CLARK, JR.

Elizabethtown, N. C., a small town in Bla-
den County, is athe revered spot where
Jerome Bayard Clark, Jr., now president of
the Davidson student body, was born on
May 8, 1911. After remaining there for
seven years, he and his family moved two
miles out in the country where for one year
Jerome was a true “son of the soil.”

Jerome took to his environment right
readily and with much ‘enthusiasm, for in|
his youthful eagerness he had a big time
going around with ‘the farm hands and mak-
ing them let him plow. He bothered them
so much, and interfered so seriously with
their wofk, that his father bought him a
plow and assigned him a plot of land all
his own. After one month of such vigor-
ous labor he quite gladly forewent-the pleas-
ure, nor has he had any desire to plow since
then. ’

His family then moved to Fayetteville, a
much larger town forty miles away. It was
indeed a case of a boy out of the country,
but not the country out of the boy. Jerome
had quite a bit of difficulty adapting him-
self to the city, and had many strange ex-
periences that now, of course, seem quite
amusing. Having never seen an automatic
air rifle, on one occasion he thought he saw
a neighboring boy shooting sparrows with
a shotgun. Going to school proved no happy
occasion, for quite a while poor little Jerome
was scared out of what wits he possessed.

Being thus ill at ease, he sought freedom
with his favorite playmate, a policeman’s
son. That character being an officer’s son,
seemed rather to exempt himself from the
law than to be more bound to it, and was
quite a renegade. Those two having been

, commissioned by their teacher to get a cedar
tree, took the liberty to hack one down on
a man’s private reservation. Upon being
discovered in this, the two were forced to
make a flighty departure through wood and
field, across-streams, and over any obstruc-
tions that might hinder them in escaping
the hot pursuit of the landowner who was
firing away with a shotgun. After the ex-
citement had settled down, Jerome realized
that he had not picked a very good crony,
and since then he has been more careful in
choosing his associates.

By the time Jerome entered high school
he had his bearings:.and was thoroughly
broken in with the life of his classmates.
School,-as—a matter of fact, was not hard
mainly because of a lax principal. To say
that the principal was a crook is neither
a fallacy nor an injustice to him, for at
present he is in the penitentiary. However,
Jerome took the advantage of all the oppor-
tunities that the school offered.

Destined to finally attain the position
which he now holds, he.stepped up gradu-
ally from an humble beginning. His last
election was not a sudden outburst of lucky
success, but the ultimate result of much ex-
perience as a leader: We shall not say it
is the peak, but looking toward the future,
say it is only one more step on the stair of
political positions which he has climbed with
so much success.

During the latter part of Jerome’s sopho-
more year in high school’ he was sent to
Raleigh as one of three delegates from his
school to the State Hi-Y Convention. You
can imagine his surprise when, at the end
of a long qualifying speech by one af his
companions, he was nominated for president
of the convention. Jerome, frozen with ter-
ror and with his brain in a tumult, was
forced to make a short “campaign” speech, a
word of which he has not since remem-
bered. The fact that the only other nomi-
nee was elected is of little importance, but

the fact that he was made vice-president is.
He realized the importance of being able to
meet such a situation, and ever since then
he has been well prepared. His consistency
as a leader has given him first honors at all
places. At the older boys’ conference the
next year he was elected as president. He
was elected president of his class and cap-
tain of the football team his senior year in
high school, and upon entering college, was
elected vice-president of the Freshman
class. The presidency of the Junior class
was one more step toward his election as
president of the student body.

For one or two summers before coming
to Davidson Jerome attended Camp Sapphire
near Brevard, N. C. There he found boys
who were of the best, and he mingled with
the councillors who were of attractive per-
sonality.and strong character. At first he
found trouble in adapting himself to the
place, but he soon formed friendships that
have proved a pleasure to him ever since.
Since then he has felt that parents should
expose their children to as good an environ-
ment as possible until they are seyenteen or
eighteen. ;

Jerome’s father came to Davidson, and so
it has always been Davidson for the son.
His mother called him Jerome in order to
avert the nickname of Jay Bird. However,
he would much prefer that to the one now
attached to him. While a freshman he once
tried earnestly to stop a power play while
scrimmaging with the varsity. When he
woke up the next morning his witty room-
mate, Chip Munroe, said, “Get up Goof,tet’s
go to Breakfast.” It was Charlie Pearce
who finally pinned the name on him, though,

after being knocked out several times him-
self.

Several Minor Changes
Made in New Catalogue

Two New Courses Offered by College
in New Issue

The new catalogue, recently published,
will have few changes from that of last
year. Two courses which were not offered
in the issue of last year are in the coming
year’s curriculum. They are Fine Artsg
which is to be taught by Dr. Harding, and
Italian, to be taught by Dr. Grey. Although
these courses were offered this year, they
did not appear in last year’s catalogue.

Probably the biggest change is in regard
tc the number of quality points necessary
for graduation. Under the old ruling the
number was two hundred. Next year the
faculty has decided that only one hundred
and forty will be required. This, though
helping the poorer student to graduate,
should not perceptibly lower scholastic av-
erages.

Another change is to be found in the
addition of a picture of Chambers Building
on the inside back cover.

It is indeed a great mark of honor for the
Jews that this little admixture of them in
foreign blood can so arouse a whole peo-
ple (the Germans).—Emil Ludwig.

|REV. GYPSY SMITH OPENS
| EVANGELISTIC SERVICES

(Continued from page 1)
Ite is not necessary to label the forest,
|“Spring”—that is self-evident. It cannot b
hidden, no more than can the overflowing
of the spirit of the new man be hidden. Mr.
| Smith referred to the lives of four men who
lhave enriched the world through their re-
| generation: Wesley, Moody, Booth and
| Whitfield. Methodism stands as a monument
lto the doctrine of rebirth, and as a lasting
‘tribute to the man Wesley, whose vision of
rebirth has led men the world ovér#to a
i new and fresh conception of the hereafter.
MoBay and Whitfield have, through their
power of speech, brought peace and change
to a world weary of. sin. Booth ' founded
the great Salvation Army that today belts
the globe, and seeks out the downcasts and
brings them face to face with the power of
the rebirth. However, this conception of re-
birth was not the invention of these men
nor any other men, but the express com-
mand of God’s Son., Mr. Smith voiced the
opinion that the leaders of the church must
be brought to a, fuller realization of this
fundamental doctrine. :

Mr. Smith asked the quéstion, “Can an

“| ; i
'old man be born again?” This he answered

| affirmatively, but emphasized the superior
|advantage of accepting Christ during youth.
|/A man can create the habit of saying “No”
|to God until he reaches the deathbed, then,
lit will not be possible for God to greet him
| with a “Well done, my good and faithful
servant.” Back in the Gypsy tents of his
+family, the story of Christ had not found
its way until Gypsy Smith, Sr., was con-

verted in a marvelous fashion. He carried
the story to an old uncle, then in his ninety-
ninth year, and the old man accepted it
with the simplicity of a child; true, he had
been reborn, but he could not look back
over a life spent in the service of his Mas-
ter. Youth, then, is the time for regenera-
tion and rebirth.

Fifty-seven years ago not one of Gypsy
Smith’s family could read or write. Since
the transformation of the life of the speak-
er’s father, however, thirteen of the family
have entered the ministry, and many more
have gone into other avenues of usefulness
and service.

Faced with these facts, the natural ques-
tion is, “How can it be?” Flowérs, said Mr.
Smith, are understood botanically; a build-
ing, architecturally; the stars, astronomic-
ally; a car, mechanically; hence, spiritual
things can only be understood spiritually.
Again, we see the Almighty take a’ storm
by the forelock, shake it ‘until it cringes at
His feet in submission. He takes the col-
ors of a living nature in His hand, mixes
them and places them behind the storm in
a mantel of rich color—the rainbow, we call
it; “The Breath of God,” the Gypsy calls
it. If these things can be, how much more
so the rejuvenation and rebirth of a sinful
man into a creature “big, strong, winsome
and attractive”!

Mr. Smith was accompanied by Mrs.
Smith, both having driven over from Dur-
ham in their car. While at Davidson, they
were entertained at Dr. Walter Lingle’s
home. Davidson counts itself blessed in rare
measure to have secured the services of
Rev. Gypsy Smith.
