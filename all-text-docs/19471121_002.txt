The Importance of Books

many. Why? Because most of us have founs

Famacey. thie extrovert is “the life of the

party,’’ whereas our man goes to listen to
others because he can’t stand himself.

The object, we then conclude, is to find
a constructive occupation for the man by
himself. One could‘ amuse himself with a
funny look or a yoyo, but what has he
gained? This constructive occupation should
consist of intellectual, spiritual or social bet-
terment for it is such attributes that make

men congenial,

In this category we find several alterna-
tives. Two of the most important are thought
and books. Youth usually finds the latter
more satisfying and so it is here that most
emphasis should be placed. To dig into a
good book is like drilling an oil well, You
work for a while and then, before you know
it, the wealth of the enterprise rushes up and
hits you in the face and showers all around
you. You say, ‘'What about those who drill
all their lives and never strike a usher

teams. It seems to me that the playing of

fighting spirit that is unequalled anywhere.

rest and recuperation from home-

festivities. There were even rumors
that Pledge John Tolbert is close-
