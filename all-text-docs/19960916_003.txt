Chambers keycards will be

By ALLIson DoLpH
Staff Writer

Last spring, the SGA voted to
recommend that a security system
be installed to protect students
studying at night in Chambers.

Subsequently; the Vice
President’s Committee, the Direc-
tor of Campus Safety, and the cam-
pus police have all seconded this
measure. By spring semester of
this year, the current doors on
Chambers will be removed and
new doors with keycard entrances
will be installed.

Lucian Dervan, Junior Class
President and the Chairman of the
Student Advisory Council to the
Director of Campus Safety, thinks
that keycards are a proactive step.
“I think it’s a great idea,” says
Dervan. “It willreally improve the
safety of students.”

Keycard systems are currently
in place on the entrances to dorms.
A desire to protect students from
outside intruders prompted the
Chambers addition.

According to Dervan, inci-
dents definitely have occurred in
Chambers. Every spring, female

students are asked to place pins in
acampus map onthe Union Board,
indicating areas where they have
been threatened or assaulted. Last
spring, three such pins were placed
on Chambers.

The heavy, outdated doors
currently on Chambers cannot sup-
port the new security system, and
would soon have to be replaced
anyway since the wood is rotting.

A major reason for the delay
in installing the keycards onCham-
bers is the Vice President's
Committee’s commitmentto find-
ing the best doors possible.

Jane Goodall to give Reynolds lecture

By ANpREW PRESTON
Staff Writer

Jane Goodall, a pioneer in
chimpanzee research, will speak at
Davidson on November 19 in Love
Auditoriumas this year’s Reynolds
Lecturer.

The Reynolds Lecture consti-
tutes the most prestigious lecture
at Davidson each year. As Vivian
Dietz, Davidson professor and
Speaker Coordinator, explains,
“The purpose of the Reynolds lec-
ture is to have a speaker of world
Stature, not just national.”

For over 30 years, the
Reynolds lecture has attracted in-
tellectual speakers from a variety

of fields. Past speakers include
Maya Angelou, Tom Foley, Tom
Wolfe, Ralph Nader and most re-
cently Cornell West.

Jane Goodall has studied and
lived with chimpanzees in their
natural habitat for more than three
decades.

In this time, she has become a
leader in improving conditions for
chimpanzees in captivity, as well
as increasing environmental aware-
ness on many levels.

Goodall makes public appear-
ances around the world, and acts as
both a political and educational
force for the preservation of the
environment.

AP tests

By ANN Cup
Staff Writer

Palms sweat and tensions run
high as 25,000 high school stu-
dents take the advanced placement
(AP) exam ineconomics each year.
Beginning in 1998, the person who
causes this stress will be the Frontis
Johnston Professor of Economics
at Davidson, Dr. Clark Ross.

With a committee of eight or
nine people, Ross will annually
change the exam as one of his
many duties as chief faculty con-
sultant for the economics AP. For
all but one year since the exam was
first offered in 1989, Ross has
served as a “table leader,” coordi-
nating the work of about ten read-
ers.

He will now oversee the grad-
ing of all economics tests for the
next several years and will partici-
pate in AP workshops to help high
school teachers better understand
the test.

“The purpose of the commit-
tee is to ensure 4 consistent grad-
ing of each student’s paper with
the ideal being that a given answer
would get the same score regard-
less of which reader graded it or
when in the grading process it was
graded,” says Ross.

It is Ross’s duty to develop a
standard. He must determine what
correct answers should be and de-
termine how to administer partial

points,

Ross: responsible for the future of many young econo

goes to the Jane Goodall Founda-
tion, which Goodall founded to
support her cause.

Goodall has published books
on her chimpanzee studies, and
has been featured in various maga-
zines, including the December
1995 issue of National Geographic.

As the Reynolds Lecturer,
Goodall will attend lunch with
Davidson students and attend a
class, most likely in biology or an
environmentally related class.

The lecture’s venue is tenta-
tively Love Auditorium, but could
be moved to accommodate larger
attendance, After the talk, a recep-
tion will be held for book signing
and questions.

College prions

AP exams are administered
for the College Board by the
Princeton, N.J., based Educational
Testing Service (ETS). Each year
ETS recruits thousands of high
school and college poe to
read those exams.

Ross says, “One thing that has
impressed me with economics is
the care and consistency which go
into the grading process. The goals
of consistency and reliability are
of utmost concern to myself, ETS,
and the College Board.”

In comparison to economics,
133,000 students take the AP U.S.
history exam and 143,000 take En-
glish.

“At Davidson, we only have ~

10-20 students each year who have
taken AP economics,” says Ross.
Many high schools don’t have a
person trained in economics, so
that is a big problem in getting the
program across the country.”

The bars will soon be locked at riight. :

|Retention rate soars

By Douc PENHALLEGON

Staff Writer

The percentage of students who graduate from Davidson in six
years or less continues to be ‘among the highest for liberal arts
colleges. U.S. News & World Report lists Davidson’ retention rate
at 91% this year, with 96% of last year's
freshman class returning for their sophomore
year.
Over the past ten years, Davidson’s
retention rate has hovered between 88 and
92%. Registrar Polly Griffin says statistics
such as 92% are “almost unheard of ... That’d be the top of anyone’s
pile.” Among the U.S. News & World Report’s 25 Best National
Liberal Arts Colleges, of which ranks Davidson 11th, the average
graduation rate for the class of ‘95 is roughly 91%.

The retention rate is viewed as an indicator of students’ overall
satisfaction with their school. Many aspects of students’ college
experiences can influence retention. These include classroom
setting, registration, social opportunities, living arrangements, ath-
letics and other facilities.

Griffin points out that because Davidson’s graduation rate is so
high, stereotyping reasons why students withdraw is speculative.
She says that those who do withdraw have highly individual reasons.

‘it_would..be hard to say if movement in the top 25

influences retention or applications,” she says.

However, Griffin also states that the college’s mission is to
provide the best undergraduate liberal arts experience in the coun-
try. Speaking on behalf of the administration, she says, “Everything :
we do is geared toward nurturing a class to graduation.”
