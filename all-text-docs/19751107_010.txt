Intramural Action

By TOM BLACKWOOD

The slayatts are dette
ever nearer in the bizarre
world of flickerball, the term
drags ever onward aboard this
oblivion express, and the in-
terest of all (well, maybe of
these reporters) is turning to
basketball.

But we'll feature the com-
pleted 3-on-3 b-ball tourney
next week. So now to the
endless stream of sub-cons-
ciousness.

In a very unimportant con-
test, 3rd Richardson (3-3)
defeated their cross-campus
rivals 3rd Cannon (1-4) by the
unimpressive score of 19-13.

Booters close out season

By DAVE WILEY
Staff Writer

The Davidson soccer team
closed out its season this past
weekend by dropping a 2-1
overtime decision at Emory.

The loss makes the team’s
record 1-10-1. The Cats played
a strong first half. against
Emory. Wildcat wing Billy
Hawk took a pass and beat the
defense downfield to score ten
minutes into the game.

“Billy just outran them,”
said teammate Phil Barringer.
‘He did a great job beating
them for the breakaway.’’

The score was still 1-0 at the
half. The Cats had outplayed
Emory, but had had no other
good opportunities to score. In
the second half the momentum
swung toward Emory.

““We smeared them in the
first half,’’ said tri-captain Bill
Vaughan, “‘but in the second
half they took control of the
midfield area.”

Coach Chip Stone did not
think the shift was due to a let
down on the part of the Cats.
“They just played much better
than they did in the first half,’’
he said.

Davidson did manage to
hold Emory off until there
were only eight minutes re-
maining in the game, but “it
was just a matter of time,’’
according to Stone.

The goal came when an
Emory forward took a lead
pass and booted it in. There
was no further scoring in
regulation time.

Emory scored in the first of

two overtime periods, and the
Wildcats could not mount a
serious attack. The defeat
ended a very frustrating
season for Davidson soccer.
‘‘We were involved in ten
very close games,’’ said Stone,
‘but we could only manage to
win one and tie one. I was
satisfied with the effort the
team gave all season,’’ he
added.” *
“TI know it was difficult to
keep the spirit up at times.”’
Several starters saw their
Davidson careers come to a
close. Tommy Blackwood,
Billy Hawk, Bill Vaughan,
and Joe Duncan all saw their
last action against Emory.
“‘We’ll have to do some
recruiting, for sure,’’ said
Stone.

Not chon more can-be said
of freshman teams. But by the
way the gym is packed night
after night with avid freshman
b-ballers, we're sure there will
be a big improvement by all
the first year squads this
winter.

Also that day there was an
important contest for all those
who don’t like twirps. SAE
(4-1) cleaned the clock of the
Bongs (also 4-1), 24-6.

We’re not saying that the
SAE’s aren’t twirps in their
own respect, we're just trying
to be nice to Tim Hose.

Further trivialities found
Dingo (1-5) forfeiting to Choc-
olate Speedway (3-2) and the
Warts of 1st Richardson (1-4)
forfeiting to IFT (4-1).

Lately there seems to be a
rash of forfeits. All we can say
is few things are more odious.
In games which involved
touchdowns and neat stuff like
that, 4th Richardson (5-1) put
fraternities to shame by
trouncing PDT#3 (4-1), 36-19.

The Gnads (3-2) also got
back to their winning ways by
exposing their best -uh- plays
to PIKA (3-3), 14-0.

Yet in the epitome of apa-
thy, Etc. (3-5) and Nazgut
(0-7) double forfeited to each
other as the lonely refs ran off
to watch the girls play.

Speaking of which, the sup-
posed ‘“‘let’s play for fun’”’
Joe’s Banana threw up a
facade of looseness and several
slimy (but several excellent)
passes to beat hard hitting
IFT (4-2), 39-14.

Meanwhile, their proteges
the SPE’s (5-1) have had an
obnoxious week of victories.
One was over 3rd Cannon
(1-5), 42-0, while the other was
against the T.J. Pecotackless
Kerwood Derbies (1-3), 60-25.

Oh, well, so much for jus-
tice.

Barely scarred SAE liqui-
dated the Whizz Kids, 46-12.
The contest flowed smoothly
for the E’s and it reminded us
of the bed-wetting antics of
our very own Hose.

Faceless Emanon outraced
Chocolate Speedway in a liter-
ally breathless encounter, 18-
12. Both teams should be
congratulated for showing up
even though its outcome
would have no consequences.

Another yawner, the Water-
pipes out-nastied the cruel
Kerwood Derbies. Several
fights broke out over the eli-
gibility of the Prong’s secret
weapon, Bogie.

Standout Alan Duncan
complained of the speedy
players’ unorthodox and pain-
ful tagging. Olt, and the
Dungeon Demons beat
PDT#2, 40-7. Now to the juicy
part.

Sixth Watts out flicked the
Sty, 12-6, on a tasteless, last
second move by Ann Savory
in the lst half. We should
remind you girls that the
purpose of the game, and
possibly life also, is to score.

3rd Little followed suit
and squirmed past 3rd Watts,
7-0. We are afraid to comment
on this game for we do not
wish to apologise to anyone
anymore.

The tired Harlem Shufflers
showed the strain of their
southern sojourn and refused
to give 1st Watts any satisfac-
tion as they forfeited. Their
second mistake was showing
up for the Sty and losing to
these wallowing hustlers 12-6.

Allis not lost though, as the
unpredictable Zoo loosed their
awesome talent and scored
over and over again against
3rd Watts.

All coeds should be proud of
these agressive players for
they show great promise of big
things to come. We’re only
sorry that it takes them at
least two years to learn how.
All the girls’ teams agreed
that Bruce Kemp has done an
excellent job as a fairly steady
referree.
