Leonard Hunchucker:
Singer, Philosopher

Davidsonian Feature Editor

“The individual should

said Leonard, dusting the top of a brown

mahogany filing cabinet in the President's office. “That's

my philosophy of life."

Leonard Hunchucker, the
Chambers janitor, was, he says.
“born here, raised here. and
likes it here.” He attended
Shaw University in Raleigh for
two years where he studied re
ligious education.

A trustee of Reeves Temple
Church, he is director of the
choir there and does quite ea
bit of singing even in his
daily work. “You'll hear
mostly spirituats,” he remark-
ed, “er you may héar rock ‘n
voli, but very little.”

Leonard began to hum softly
and dusted around the window
frames. “You've been here for
some time,” 1 began. “What
trends have you noticed in the
college?”

Zeonard thought awhile and
re-dusted the mahogany cabi-
net. “Well, the spirit here has
falien down. I guess we don’t
have what you'd call a winning
team. I mean I’m trying to tell
you ask me. But the spirit
is greatly down.

“I’m a music man myself,
and some may differ; but this

then every student knew the
song, and you'd hear it, too.
And just because the cheer-
leaders stopped, the stands
didn’t stop yelling. You'd
come back from a game and
stilt talk about it, and you’d
race to the Sunday paper to
find out what the writer had
to say about it.”

“What's happened to this
spirit?” I probed.

“So goes time, so goes the

human man,” he answered sen-.

tentiously. He emptied an ash-
tray in the metal trashean by
the door, left the room momen-
tarily, and returned. He moved
a paper tray and swished his
dust cloth over the waxed-glass
table top, I watched him intent-
ly working and singing softly
to himself.

“How is it you manage to
keep so cheerful?” I comment-
ed.

‘Well, thet’s my work. |
don’t try to let anything
worry me. A. person who's
happy, | think, hes got a bet-
ter look on life anyway. And
why let something worry you.
That's why the asylums are
so full. You don’t want to
let it get to the place where
it’s going to affect you,
Things come to pass. If’s go-
ing to be that way,” he mused
in Methodist-adopted Presby-
terianism..

“And I disapprove of this
panic button, this worry over
exam cramming,” he went on.
“I'd just as soon see a man with
a high school education with
common sense than see a man
with a whole lot of book learn-
ing in his head and no common
sense. It would never happen if
we'd keep up from ‘day to day.
And one of the main losses in
college is the student sleeping
in class.”

“You mentioned you were in
Korea for four years,” I remind-
ed: “Do you remember any par-
ticular war experience you
had?”

such praiso as the following
from The New York Herald

Mr. Meredith is a scholar

nations, courteous sympathies

blocking progress in the area
of disermament and nucleer
test bans.

Mr. David deBoinville, Re-
gional Informations Officer for
the British Embassy in Wash.
ington, represented the British
viewpoint.

He observed that the Summit
conference may resemble the
imminent Republican national
convention in that both groups
will have trouble finding some-
thing pleasant. to talk. about.

Mr. deBoinville warned
against too much’ optimism
and stated that the confer-
ence would be one of a servies
of summits, and not an ovl-
standing peak.

- He said, “The bargaining posi-
tion’ is compromise,” but also
expressed wariness about the
popular -_phrase

‘tensions,”’

Britain, he asserted, is seek-

jing to return to normal trade

relations, normal freedom of
communication. and normal in-
ternal behavior.

He concluded by saying
that negotiations are a. search
for common ground, and that
the May conference is @ start
in the right direction.

Franee was represented by an
attache from the French embas-
sy in Washington, Mr. Jacques
DuPont.

Mr. DuPont said that France
will accept any reasonable dis-
armament ‘proposal, if-and only
if it includes provisions for the
cessation of manufacturing of
nuclear devices, the destruction
of present stockpiles, and a ban
on the development of nuclear
weapons. However, he pointed
out that the great difficulty was
a control and inspection system
to enforce such a program.

Concerning Germany, Mr.
DuPont stated that the issue,
basically, is reunification, and
that the Gerlin crisis was
brought about artificlaily by
Mr. Khrushchev.

Mr. DuPont's rhb’ osint.
was there should ba 3 rai!
concern for mankind in our

efforts, Consequently, he
urged further sid to under-
developed countries.

In conclusion, Mr.
reiterated the British proposal
— the normalization of the
world situation.

ment of State Office of Re-
search and Analysis for the

the United States position.

Concerning disarmament,
Mr. Sonnefeldt cited three
major difficulties. First,
nuclear test ban cannot be
enforced without elaborate
controls, Second, total dis-
armament. is necessary to
completely solve the problem.
Third, the Soviets want dis-
armament in theory, but offer
no way to get at it.

He, pointed out that the So:
viet Union has refused to pool
its efforts with the Western

powers in aiding underdevelop. |

ed countries.

The ‘United ‘States has refused
to sign a non-aggression pact
with .the Soviets, he continued,
because such a pact could be
used to undermine the West's
tiefenses,

Mr. Sonnefeldt concluded
Sy pointing out that every
tasting agreement between
the East and the West was
negotiated on flower fevels,
while all summit agreements
