ROTC Recieves Commissions

By Ted Richardson
Believe it or not at least thir-
teen seniors actually know what
they will be doing after gradu-
ation. Branch assignments for
_ senior Davidson ROTC cadets
arrived late last week and brought
with them a number of surprises.
Despite recent talk of cutbacks in
the military, a majority of
Davidson’s thirteen senior cadets
received active duty assignments,
although many requested reserves.
In the past, Davidson College
has provided the Army a dispro-
portionate number of top rate offi-
cers. The reputation of the school
alone may answer why so many
cadets received active duty assign-
ments this year, All thirteen cadets
will receive an Army commission
following graduation in May. Most

of these new lieutenants will at-
tend the Basic Course of their
specific branch sometime before
October 1, though a few must wait
until the 1993 fiscal year to begin
duty.

Active duty _commitments
generally run four years while
reserve commitments last eight. If
tradition holds, however, many of
these Davidson graduates will far
extend their initial commitment to
make successful careers: of the
Army.

The following were this year’s
branch assignments:
Kevin Griggs -- Signal Corps
Mac Grimes -- Ordnance Corps
(detailed Infantry)
Chris Henderson -- Judge Advo-
cate General Corps (educational
