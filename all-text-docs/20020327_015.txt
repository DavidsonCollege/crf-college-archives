For the first time in school history as a
Division I program, the women’s tennis
team received a national ranking of 68 in
the country from the Omni Hotels Colle-
giate Tennis Rankings. Tied for the same
spot are Brown, Long Island, and
Winthrop, the last being Davidson’s lat-
est foe. On March 22, Davidson faced
this nemesis, only to emerge as losers in
Winthrop’s 5-2 win.

Losing only their second game of the -

year, the team
struggled from
the beginning,
losing the
doubles point to
Winthrop.
Winthrop’s Judit
Trunkos~ and
Renata Caceres
sneaked by with
a 9-7 win over
freshmen Kelly
and Meghan
Fillnow. With a
close 8-5 deci-
sion, Ana
Simanca = and
Jenny Andrade
defeated David-
son freshman
Meggie Patterson and sophomore
Katherine Hatch. In the final match-up,
Winthrop’s Renata Barreto and Jacki
Deason proved too strong for senior cap-
tain Kelly Cantrell and junior. captain
Yasamina Hilu, winning with an 8-3 de-
cision...

In the singles match-ups, Kelly Fillnow
sought revenge over Winthrop’s
Trunkos, soundly defeating her, 6-3, 6-
1. At the number two spot, Patterson
pulled the Wildcats ahead with her own
revenge over Simanca, 6-1, 6-1. How-
ever, that would be the end.of the Wild-
cat points, as Winthrop swept the num-
ber 3-6 positions.

Barreto defeated Meghan Fillnow, 6-
4, 7-5, while Andrade snuck by Cantrell
with a close 7-6(4), 7-6(5). This is the
first singles loss of the season for
Cantrell, a player who was recently
ranked 131st in the nation.

At the final two spots, Caceres came
out with a 6-3, 6-0 decision over Hilu
while Natasha Lucki snuck by Hatch, 6-
4, 6-4.

The Wildcats returned to the courts on
March 24 for their first conference match
against Wofford. Despite several strong
individual performances, the team could
not pull out the win, as the Terriers took
home the victory, 4-3. The Wildcats did
rebound from their last doubles perfor-
mance, sweeping the point. Fillnow and
Fillnow combined for a strong 8-3 win
over Wofford’s Wendy Rohr and Lauren
Marie Whiesenhunt, while Patterson and
Hatch shut out Delaine Hare and Meghan
Turner. Rounding out the line-up,
Cantrell. and Hilu came away with a 8-1
win over Mary
Wallace DeBerry

and Kristine
Banks.

Cantrell com-
mented, “Our

doubles play was

outstanding. We

really dominated
early and just
kept putting them
away. That could
be the best our
doubles teams
have played all
season.”

In singles,

Rohr came away
with a close win
over Kelly Fillnow,
7-5, 1-6, 6-3, while Whisenhunt brought
home a 7-5, 6-2 win over Patterson to
give the Terriers the lead. Meghan
Fillnow tied it up again with a 6-3, 6-4
win over Hare, while Cantrell gave the
Wildcats the lead with a win over Turner,
6-0, 1-0 (retired due to injury). Cantrell
improves to 12-1 on the season. How-
ever, the Terriers proved too much as
they swept the last two spots. DeBerry
defeated Hilu, 6-4, 6-3, while Banks
shut out Hatch, 6-0, 6-0.

Freshman Meghan Fillnow remarked
on the loss, explaining, “We’ve been on
such a high, especially after beating a
national-ranked team, so this Wofford
match was definitely a tough loss.”

She continues, “But sometimes you
need a loss to get you more pumped up
and hungry for what lies ahead.”

What lies ahead is a series of confer-
ence match-ups, beginning on March 26
against Western Carolina.

The Wildcats next home competition
is on March 29 against East Tennesse
State. :

Relay team goes to nationals

By CAROLINE HAUSER
Sports Editor

Four of Davidson’s top swimmers trav-
eled to Minneapolis, Minnesota, to com-
pete in the Phillips 66 Spring Nationals.

Senior Shelley Conroy, sophomore
Jenny Hoekstra, and freshmen Melissa
Marquez and Trisha Blackwell make up
Davidson’s women’s 400-medley relay
team. :

In the national competition, the four
Wildcats came in 26th overall, finishing
the race in just over four minutes and 34
seconds. :

Even more impressive is the fact that
each woman on the team swam her re-
spective best time in the event.

A first year team member with two
top-five school times already, Blackwell
described the national competition as
“an incredible experience—swimming
with and against some of the biggest

names in the sport was not only exciting,
but also an honor.”

Hoekstra agreed, “The meet was in-
credible. It’s still hard for me to believe
that we have swimmers at that level. We
were among Olympians, world record
holders, and national champions.”

Marquez, whose freshman campaign
shattered two school records (100 and
200 breast), said, “It was just really re-
warding to be competing with swimmers
at that level. We had a pretty good race,
we all swam better than we thought we
would.”

“Our relay did well,” said Conroy.
“We placed 26th, which was higher than
we were seeded, and we were proud to
have been a part of it all.”

Conroy, who recently set anew school
record in the 100-meter fly, said the
weekend was “lots of fun and fast swim-
ming. As a senior, it was an awesome
way to end my swimming career.”
