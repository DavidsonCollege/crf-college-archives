Contract
Offers Pay
increases

By LOUIS LESESNE
Devidsonien Staff Writer

The ROTC Vitalization
Act of 1964, recently sign-
ed into law by the Presi-
dent, has caused little stir
on the Davidson campus.
Aside from the pay in-
crease, there is little dif-
ference from the present
aw.

So far, approximately 245
juniors and seniors who were
previously enrolled under the
old contract have signed the
new contract, with virtually all
of the 15 remaining men ex-
pected to signed before the De-
cember deadline.

[:

Some of those who do not ex-
pect to sign the new contract
are seniors who plan to be
married in the near future. An
executive order exempting mar-
ried men from the draft went!
into effect after members of
the Senior Class had signed
the contract during ‘their soph-
omore year.

Some others have reconsid-
ed their enrollment in the ad-
vanced program in relation to
graduate school. Because of
the length of most graduate
programs, they have chosen
not to continue the advanced
program and accept a com-
mission. By merely failing to
sign the new contract. "they
withdraw themselves from the
program.

During the two years of the
advanced program, total pay
will be approximately $1.100, in-
cluding. monthly pay, summer
camp pay, and uniform allow-
ance. Lay under the old pro-
gram- amounted to approxi-
mately $750.

According to a letter sent to
parents of all men enrolled in
the present program. the only
other major change is a clause
stating that any man entering
the contract for the purpose of
defrauding the. government or
willfully evading the contract
must forfeit any opportunity to
obtain a reserve commission.
He is then referred to his Re-
serve Board and is liable for
two years active duty as an en-
listed man.

Student Leaders Give
Drinking Poll Results

Will Jackson, Fred Sackett and Charlie Dibble sub-

4 mitted the results of the Student Council drinking poll

and offered suggestions as to a more realistic approach
to the situation by the Student Council, the Honor Court
and the faculty and administration at the monthly fac-
ulty meeting Tuesday.

The poll was taken on Oct.
20 through. the fraternities, but
the Student Council feels that
it is a realistic projection of the
entire student body, and is ac-
curate enough to serve as a
guide toward student attitudes.
The poll itself was broken down
into three questions. The poll
and its results are as follows.

1. Do you drink? Yes 81 per
cent (350); No 19 per cent (82).

2. Have you ever possessed
alcohol on. campus? Yes 70 per
cent (302); No 30 per cent.

Ths 70 per cent of the en-
tire number of students polled.
When it is translated to a per-
centage of thase who drink, the
result is 86 per cent.

3. Have you ever possessed

This is of the entire number
of students polled, and the
translated number of those who
drink wha have possessed al-
coholic. beverages im the dorms
is 46 per cent.

‘The poll includes only the up-
per tliree classes of the fra-
ternities, and a total of 432
answered the poll.

For comparison we look at
the resu'ts of a poll taken by
THE DAVIDSONIAN in Octob-
er, 1982. This poll inc:aded the
results of 540 students.

1. Do you drink? Yes @6 per
cent.

2. Have you ever kept alco-
holic beverages on campus?

in the 1
alcoholic as 30 per cent (185); Yes, 37 per cent. This was the
No 64 per cent extent of the questions asked

om er . at that time.

Under the present rule there
‘is no distinctiow made between
having alcoho.ic beverages on
campus and specifically having
them in the dorms as opposed
to having them in an automo-
bile. From the poll it can be
concluded that the rule is being
violated on both accounts.

tives, and deferred any action

S‘nP Plans To Issue
Humorous Fall Volume

Seripts ‘n Pranks fall issue will come out on Nov.
30, according to Pete Crow, editor.

Crow revealed that the issue would contain a shock-
ing expose of a Davidson faculty member. This type
of yellow-press sensationalism will be used to try to
create more interest by the readers than has been
evident in the past.

In an attempt to add status, this Seripts ‘n Pranks
will contain a three page, full-length picture of David-
sonian editor Charles Dibble lying in bed. This will
also attempt to compensate for the embarrassment
which Crow received when he forfeited the annual
croquet match to Dibble.

Crow emphasized the fact that the Scripts ‘n Pranks
is purely a student humor magazine and will not com-
pete with the newly formed serious literary magazine.
He stated, “Both are needed because one magazine
cannot do both humor and serious literature.” Obvi-
ously, Seripts ‘n Pranks cannot.

This year’s Seripts ‘n Pranks will follow last year’s
precedent by publishing three issues, the last one by
next year’s elected editor.

The winter edition will contain the work of. the |

winner of the Freshman writing contest. The dead-
line for this contest is Dec. 16.
