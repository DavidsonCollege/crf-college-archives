Biedenbach signs 4 recruits despite

By BERT MOBLEY

Sports Editor
Coach Eddie Biendenbach,
the basketball coaching staff,
and Wildcat basketball fans will
not forget the Sports Illustrated
article that blasted Davidson
recruiting policies for a long
time. After all the controversy
has passed over, however, the
story might not have done as
much harm to Davidson basket-

ball as it first seemed.

“Initially we had to answer
and explain it so much that it
was ridiculous,’’ Coach Bieden-
bach said. ‘‘But now it has a
more positive factor,’ he con-
tinued, ‘‘in that the jist is
forgotten, the wrong accusa-
tions are forgotten, but the
Davidson basketball name
sticks in people’s mind.”’

The story did affect the 1979
basketball recruiting year in
that the coaching staff had to
‘‘work hard and spend more

money” to disclaim the story.
“But it did not hurt recruiting
at all,” he said.

Davidson has announced the
signing of four recruits for next
year’s team, and Coach Bieden-
bach feels that they will make
‘great contributions in aca-
demics, attitude, and basket-
ball.’’ He said, ‘‘The four
players that we signed will help
immediately to improve the
basketball picture at David-
son.”

John Carroll of DeMatha
High School in Hyattsville,
Md., was Davidson’s first
signee for 1979. Carroll is a 6-2,
180-pounder who averaged 17
points, 5 assists, and 4 steals
per game last winter. He shot
58 percent from the floor and 86
percent from the foul line.
Coach Biedenbach said, ‘‘He
plays defense, he’s team ori-
ented, can shoot and score, and
can do the play making.”

Intramural Bowling League formed this winter

Bowling season ends this weekend;

Fighting Sheep still in first place

By BRUCE LIPSITZ
Staff Correspondent
This past winter term, a
group of students formed the
Intramural Bowling League
with Bruce Lipsitz as president.
This league has been independ-
ently run with rio IMAC sup-
port. League matches have been
held each Friday afternoon at
8:15 at Moor Lanes in Moores-
‘ville since the last week of
winter term.
The league consists of ten
teams. These teams represent
all walks of Davidson life:
Harry’s Fighting Sheep (ATO),
. KA, Rumbles and the Chain-
mail Gang (Sig Ep), Surrogate
Mothers (FIJI), SAE, J.D.
Testers (Sig Ep), Gutter
Skunks (FIJI pledges), Misfits
(ind.), Hoopes & Co. {ind.), and
We Know We’re Great (old
freshman hall).
The season will conclude this
weekend. Harry’s Fighting

Sheep is in first place with a
somewhat comfortable lead.

Although six 200-plus games
have been bowled so far, aver-
ages range from approximately
175 down to 100. Most of the
approximately 55 bowlers aver-
age between 110 and 125.

Next year, the Union Games
Committee will sponsor three

seven-week seasons—one each.

term. Trophies will be awarded
tothe championship team each
season. Chances are now very
good that bowlers will be able to
count the League towards the
P.E. requirement.

Current bowling standings
are posted at the Union infor-
mation desk, the Wildcat
Sports News bulletin board on
the Library’s main floor, and on
the door of Sentelle 1. For more
information, contact Bruce Lip-
sitz at Sentelle 1 (-6139) or Fess
Crockett at Belk 218 (-6176).

bility” of 6-5, 190 pound Rich
Wilson of McLean High School
in Virginia. Wilson averaged
19.1 points per game and also
averaged 11.8 rebounds and 5.6
assists.

Cat’s Bob Lapple may find future in pros

By MIKE LINS
Staff Writer

Davidson has had a number
of good athletes in the past
years, but there have few who
were recognized nationally as
truly great. Dick Snyder, Mike
Mai.oy and John Gerdy in
basketball, Jimmy Poole, Mike
Mikolayunas in football and
George Weicker in baseball are
a few such great performers.
Surely, in the future’ Bob
Lapple will be remembered as
one of the all-time great base-
ball players at Davidson Col-
lege.

- Lapple, a 6-foot, 195-pound
junior, was voted All-Southern
Conference catcher both his
freshman and sophomore years
and stands a good chance of
year. After his sophomore year,
he was named to the NCAA
Division III baseball team. In
his college career, Lapple has
been very consistent at the
plate, batting a strong .310 over

three years.

Such credentials should as-
sure Lapple of a phone call from
a pro team on June 7. That’s the
day the big league draft begins
and since scouts have been
watching him so eagerly for
three years, his chances of being
drafted seem excellent.

‘\My goal is to play pro ball,”
Lapple says, and his opportuni-
ty, may arise soon since, as a
junior, he becomes eligible for
the pro draft. (No pro team may
draft a college player prior to
his junior year.)

If drafted, Lapple hopes to
play pro ball this summer, then
return to Davidson for fall and
winter terms.

“Since the pros start spring
practice. just about the same
time our spring term begins, I
can stay in school with the team
here before leaving for spring
workouts.”” Lapple then plans
to return the following fall or
winter to finish his require-
ments for graduation.

By being drafted, Lapple will

‘join three other Wildcats,
* George Weicker, Tim Barr and

Stan Brown, all of whom are
playing pro ball now. These few
pro players hardly make David-
son a nationally respected base-
ball school. Why then did a
player of Lapple’s caliber
choose to come to Davidson?

“IT came to play both football
and baseball, and, as it worked
out, things went best in base-
ball. I’ve never regretted com-
ing to Davidson because I think
it has a lot to offer. The
education is great and the

opportunity to have close
friends is much better than at a
large university ,”’ Lapple said.

After his freshman year,
Lapple was offered
at several schools including
William and Mary and Temple,
but he decided to stay at
Davidson. :

Lapple.credits Davidson’s
coach, Palmer Muench, with
much of his personal success.
“Coach Muench really helped
me with my hitting. He’s a
great coach who cares about his
players both as athletes and as

. Coach Muench says about

Lapple, ‘“‘He is the most well-
rounded catcher I’ve ever
coached. His strong arm, quick.
bat and, most importantly; his
motivation should make it pos-
sible for him to be successful in
the bigleague.”

As Bob Lapple finishes his
given Davidson a great contri-
bution of his own: the dedica-

. tion of his time, talents, and

will: be missed by coaches,
fellow players, and friends, the
Davidson community must be-
lieve that Lapple has a bright

future in baseball.

Another uneventful, or at least un-
successful, year of Davidson sports has
come to a close. As usual the losses far
out weighed the wins in the major
sports. Many of the minor sports had
winning years, though, and things are
certainly looking good in that respect.

It is true, however, that there is
some well-founded optimism in the
camps of our two big-time sports.
Eddie Biedenbach’s squad is looking
forward to an extended return of Rich
DiBenedetto, the continued improve-
ment of this year’s freshmen, as well as
some good recruits. Of course this
wasn’t a particularly successful season
just past, but if the good players stick
around (which in view of recent history

isn’t something upon which we can
rely) it seems the basketball program
may be on the upswing.

The situation in football doesn’t look
all too bad, either. The grid-Cats are
coming off a-5-5.season with some very
impressive performances under their
belt. The club shows considerable
potential, and this year’s freshman
class is expected to contribute quite a
bit to next year’s lineup.

Any experienced Davidson sports
follower will assure you that all this is
no guarantee of success, but it does
seem fair to say that at least the
potential for an upswing is there.

But getting back to the minor sports
(which, as I mentioned before, are
providing us with considerable suc-
cess), it seems that their situation is
very precarious. It is with their plight
that I am concerned.

It has continually been the policy to
keep the emphasis on tennis, baseball,
soccer, track, swimming, and the
women’s sports at a minimum. Many
of these sports have had recent success

oe
with little material support coming
from our athletic policymakers. The
only exception is soccer, which is now
benefitting from increased emphasis.
The point is that these are all

- potentially successful and vibrant pro-

grams, and could be upgraded._tremen-
dously at relatively little cost.

The way it stands now, the coaches
of these sports haven’t the opportunity
(for financial reasons) to do much

_ recruiting at all and for all intents and

purposes must accept random athletes
coming out of the admissions process.
There is no way that these coaches—
and let it not be mistaken that we have
some very good people coaching the
minor sports— have any control over
their programs. Their lack of finances
forces them to be at the mercy of

chance when it comes to the continuing .

success and stability of their programs.

It is, in fact, the case that some of

these minor sports are actually being
de-emphasized when at so relatively

little cost they could be improved
considerably.

The situation for the minor sports at
Davidson is so absurd that the Athletic
Department turns down (as a matter of
policy) donations that are offered on
the condition that they be used only for
a particular minor sport. This ridicu-
lous policy has cost golf and baseball
considerable money.

Meanwhile, incredible sums are
spent in the two sports which are the
most difficult for a small school to
compete in. The trustees think we can
make a name for ourselves if we
succeed. As I stated before, things may
be on the upswing, but I still think that

“if” looms mighty large.

The fact that we could, with little
reasonable doubt, maintain success in
our minor sports if they were empha-
sized more is important. We might

_ even make a’name for ourselves.

Although things may be looking up
in our big-time athletics, I still think it
might be beneficial if the trustees did
some re-evaluating of the sports pro-
gram here at. Davidson, their
cloud of unrealistic nostalgia b ehind.
