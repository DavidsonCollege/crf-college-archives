LARGE NUMBER OUT
FOR FRESH TEAM

Ra CASKIE NOVELL 52.

During a summer, in which most
of the members of the student
body spent their time chasing
blondes, following the best dances,
or trekking to the Windy City for
the Century of Progress Exposi-
tion, yours truly, the old news
hound, was endeavoring to track
down some dope on Davidson ath-
letics and athletes. Despite the |
hardships involved, a few items of
interest turned up, and so we find
ourselves back at the grind with
prospects before us for a swell
athletic year. .

To start things off, Jack Wagner,
erstwhile Davidson athlete, crashed the |
headlines by eliminating the famous |
Tully Blair in the opening round of |

the State Amateur Golf Championship.

to Emmett Spicer for the southern
amateur crown, in the tournament held |
at the Sedgefield Country Club.

Then the entire student body
was shocked and decidely de-
pressed by the news of the illness
and temporary paralysis of that
popular Davidson star, Shrimp
Morris. Morris, star end in foot-
ball, and all-state first sacker and
varsity captain in baseball, was
stricken with what was thought to
be infantile paralysis while play-
ing summer ball in Edenton. He
is now on the road to recovery,
and every loyal Davidson man is
pulling for Shrimp to come around
O. K.

“Jimmy Halverstadt, Davidson's top |
ranking net star, entered several im- |
portant tennis tournaments, and made}
creditable showings in all of them. It;
will be remembered that Jimmy was
runner-up to Wilmer Hines in the |
State intercollegiate meet last year.

A number of Davidson athletes |
played semi-pro ball this summer,
and the illustrious Graham Luns-
ford (Doc) Mathis landed a reg-
ular berth.with the Winston-Salem
Twins of the Piedmont League.
Attention now centered the

approaching grid season, however, and
this column will make every effort to
cover it fully throughout the season.

The ’Cats take on Elon this Sat-
urday in the opening encounter for
both teams, although the Christians |
had a little practice tiff last week- —|
end, in which they came off rather |
second-best to say the least.
Coaches Newton and McEver are |
priming a strong team with a |
light, fast charging line, and as |
fine an array of shifty backs as |
ever you set your peepers on, for
that opening game.

The line-up is yet indefinite, but it;
wouldn’t surprise the old boy to see!
those Wildcats line up something like
this’: next Saturday: Morgan and Grant |
on the flanks; Hand and Ross at the}
tackle berths; Captain Rives and

captain, at the pivot position, and a)

Field,
For the past two weeks, Coaches

McEver have been con-
sistently drilling the Davidson candi-
dates, and a long scrimmage was held
Saturday in which the first and sec-
ond teams participated.

Elon will have the

advantage of
last Saturday,
far more for-
midable foe than many Davidson stu-
dents expect. Also, it is permissable
for the Christians to play Freshmen
on the varsity team, and this should
prove to be another point in their fa-
vor. Elon’s grid record for last year
is not very impressive due to the fact
that a large number of letter men were
lost by graduation. But this year’s
team will have the services of twelve

letter men, besides added strength
from. various places throughout the
nation.

Walser, of Salisbury, at center, and
Neal, of Ensley, Ala., at fullback, have
strengthened Coach Walker's machine

considerably. Moreover, the Elon
backfield will outweigh that of Da-
vidson, the average of which is ap-

proximately 160 pounds, However, the
Wildcats have plenty of speed to off-
set this handicap.

The of the opposing lines
will be about even, depending upon
whether or not. “Tubby” Hand, who
recently has been idle due to an ankle
injury, starts at a tackle berth. Should
Siewers start in place of Hand, the
Davidson line would be some seventy
pounds lighter,

At the present it is impossible for
Coach Newton. to name his line-up for
the Elon game, since the two David-
son teams which serimmaged on Rich-
Field last Saturday were
evenly matched, The selection will be
made shortly before game time. The

the hope of seeing their names in the
