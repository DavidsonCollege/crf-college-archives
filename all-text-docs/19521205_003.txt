All three of the Cats’ opponents’
offer an impressive lineup of mat-
men. Auburn’s perennial Southeast.
ern Conference champions are once
again tabbed as the tcam to beat
in the SEC, while Emory Univer-
sity has always come up with a
power-packed squad. VMI made a
strong showing in the Southern
Conference last year.

The Davidson team, captained
this season by Morley Vail, will
have their hopes riding on the
men in the first five weights, with
Gene Craven expected to set the
pace,

The probable starters for the
Wildcats are Bobby Joe Key,
123 lbs.; Charlie Murray, 130;
Morley Vail or Don Reid, 137;
Gene Craven, 147; John Bux-
ton, 157; Bill McElveen or
Bill Coe, 167; Bill Bryson, Coe,
or Bud Duncan, 177; and Monty
Littlejohn, heavyweight. Some
of the more promising fresh-
men have been Craig and
Webb at 133 pounds, and
Henry Faison at 157 pounds.

vision, was an outstanding | per-

All-Interfraternity
Grid Team Paced
By SPs, Phi Delts

In a poll run among the first.
string players of all the fraternities
and the Campus Club taken during
the past week the Sig Eps and
the Phi Delts gained dominance
of the All-Fraternity Team for the
1952 tag football season.

Horace Ball of the third-place
Sig-Eps was voted by a large mar-
gin to be the outstanding player
in the league this year. Thus,
Horace is the captain of the mythi-
cal “big seven” of the frat league.

Listed below are the top players
of the interfratérnity tag football
league in order of the number of
votes they reccived:

First Team
Horace Ball, Sr.. Sig Ep.
Moffatt Ware, Fr.. Sig Ep.
Tyler Berry, Sr., Sigma Chi,
Jim Smith, Sr., Pika.
Max DeVane, Jr., Phi Delt.
T. W. Aldred, Sr. KA,
Don Lazenby, Sr., Phi Delt.

Second Team

George King, Sr., KA.

Tom Lambé, So., Beta.

George Thomas, Sr., Beta.

Tom Hancock, So., Pi Kapp.

Bob Mitchell, Jr. Sigma Chi

Corky Clark, So., Kappa ‘Sig.

Tie for Seventh Place Between:

Bill Hanna, So., Pika.

Bill ‘Marable, Sr., Sig Ep.

Joc Dugley, Sr., Kappa Sig.

George Lippard, Sr., Kappa Sig.

Horace Ball, Sig-Ep (Captain)

Horace Ball was one’ of the main
reasons that the Sig Eps finished
another fine. season this year.
Horace's cool operations from the
tailback slot was the big differ-
ence. “H" is a fine passer and a
good deceptive runner. This is the
second straight year that Horace
has received the honor of being
hamed to the top seven in the
league.

Moffatt Ware, Sig Ep

The only freshman elected to
either of the top two teams this
year was the Sig Eps’ Moffatt Ware.
Moffatt has been lauded as_ the
best end in the league and he cer-
tainly earned that rating. He was
probably the leading scorer in the
loop as he scored at least once in
almost every game. Next year's Sig
Ep squad will depend heavily on
the services of this speedy fresh-
man.

Pack Favored In
Conference Tilt

By JOHN
Davidson’s

Wildcat basketballers open their

HANDLEY
1952-53

Southern Conference schedule tomorrow night in Reynolds Col-
liseum in Raleigh to tangle with the powerful N. C. State
Wolfpack. State’s defending conference champs are decided fa-

vorites in the encounter.

Look. Magazine's cake predic-
tions for the nation this season rank
State as second only to Hlinois.

Both teams opened their seasons
earlier this week on a winning note
as Davidson took Erskine and
State downed Furman. According
to Coach Danny Miller who
watched the Strate-Furman tussle,
the “Pack” will be as tough as ever
and even taller than last year:

Dave Gotkin, a newcomer to the
State ranks, ran away with top
scoring honors for State in turning
in a fine floor game against Fur.
mati. Gotkin and Bill Kukoy are
the main problems for the Cats. °

Next Tuesday here in Johns-
ton Gym the Wildcats will take
on one of the finest cage out-
fits that Furman has pro-
duced recently. Led by their
big guns Frank Selvy and

Neil Gordon who racked 36

points between them against

State, the Purple Hurricane is

considered ae one of the chief

contenders with State for the

Conference crown.

As the Cats made their °52 de-
debut last Monday night against
the Flying Flect of Erskine, they

showed a fine offensive punch and:

plenty of hustle in the 89-76 win.
Coach Miller used f1 men with the
scoring well distributed among six
players.

Miller intends to continue using
a large. number of men at least un-
til a fine working combination is
discoyered. The Davidson coach
seemed pleased with the showing
of his Cats and was quick to point
out that it was definitely a team
victory.

King, Dudley Praised

Miller offered special praise for
Jerry King who connected for 20
points and for Joe Dudley with 16.
However, the new Wildcat mentor
was especially pleased with the fine
showing of 6 7" George Melton
who came through nicely with 14
markers. These three ,are pretty
sure starters against State tomor-
row night.

Other members of the squad to
see action in Monday’s tussle were
J. V. Howell, Buddy Brown,
“Pappy” Fowle, Ed Weeks, Corky

Good for 20 again tomorrow?
Burdette, “Ish” Rennett, Hobby

Cobb, and Scott Reams. Five of
these men had never seen varsity
acion before, but all broke into
the scoring column except Cobb.
Coach Miller plans to use this
group a lot in future games: with
many substitutions. .

The six cagers who carried most
of the scoring punch for the Cats

against Erskine have an average
height of 6 2” which, though
rather short . considering — the

modern basketball giants, is taller
than most of the recent Wildcat
chiubs,
