ney was UNCC, one of our biggest
rivals and one we hadn’t beaten in
a long time. To my personal eter-
nal shame I didn’t go into Char-
lotte for the game - had to study
and all that. Big mistake. Ukrop,
who was voted the national soccer
player of the year by at least one
poll and who led all division 1
players in scoring, won the game
on a bicycle kick. That’s where
you do a back flip and kick the ball
while trying not to land on your
head.

Most try to survive the kick.

Ukrop scored on it.

Local news ate it up and re-
played it all over the place:
Davidson had beaten its biggest
rival and was astep closer toreally

hosting the final four.

Next was Coastal Carolina,
and the ominous result was a tie
and penalty kicks. Ukrop missed
our first kick, leaving goalie Alex

Deegan inatough spot of having to
catch us up to Coastal. He did, and
how! He blocked five of Coastal’s
10 kicks (you just don’t do that!!!),
three of which would have won the
game for the Chanticleers. Fresh-
man (now. senior) Ryan
Northington scored the winner for
us. I think my voice is still hoarse
from yelling at that game. I consid-

That’s as far as it went, unfor-

State team that beat us 3-2, actu-

Castelloé, out with too many yel-
low cards. That, and maybe sheer
exhaustion killed us. That’s OK,
we made it, we hosted the party,
we went to the final four. Vitale

Ukrop, who went on to star in a

It can be done here.

But could it happen again?

You gotta believe.

Fishing the late

By Joun RoE

The sun had just peaked over

' the treeline on the other side of

Lake Norman, and the water was
as smooth as ice.

THE GREAT

OUTDOORS

The early morning rush-hour
traffic on I-77, usually a constant
hum, was not yet in progress. The
rest of the world was still in bed,
probably hitting snooze for the sec-
ond time, but I was standing on the
water’s edge, ready to coax Lake
Norman’s bass from bed.

My first cast sailed about 30
yards into deep water, just off a
rock point. I waited until the ripples
from my Jitterbug faded into the
still water, then I began a slow
retrieve.

I watched the lure churn water
out of its path until finally, an ex-
plosion sent my lure barreling

- through the air. I saw the green

_) summer largemouths

back, the black lateral stripe and
then the white belly of a large-
mouth bass roll and slap the water,
then it returned into the deep wa-
ter.

I let my lure lay motionless,
for [knew that bass were still in the
area. After a few seconds, I gave
the Jitterbug one tiny twitch, and
just as I expected, the bass was
watching. The water exploded once
again, but this time my lure stayed
on this side of the lake.

The bass was hooked, and
within a few moments, I had landed
and released the fish.

In the late summer, one of the
best ways to consistently catch bass
is to “wake them up,” or “put them
to bed.” This means fishing in the
two lowlight periods, sunrise and
sunset. In late summer; most big
fish become sluggish, feeding by
nightand bedding thick cover when
the sun is out.

Because the fish go on the
prowl at night, fishing big lures
such as Heddon’s Zara Spook, Jit-
