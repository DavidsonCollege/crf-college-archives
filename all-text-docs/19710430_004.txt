To Be Self Governed

With the governance committee meeting to de-
cide on the: living patterns of the student body, it
is timely and important that the students make a
strong casé for whichever system they prefer.

Our position is one which was called ‘‘No norms
in the dorms” by one faculty member. Stated in its
simplest terms what we advocate is a lease system
for dormitory rooms.

When a student enters college and particularly

when he is about to graduate, the college should: not
have the responsibility or right to act as a doting par-
ent, intent on making sure that Junior does nothing
to harm himself morally, mentally, physically or
spiritually. pei
~ College is a time of transition between the fami-
ly situation and living on your own in the broader
world. To be subject to the dormitory regulations of
the college is not the way to develop that independ-
ence. ‘
A lease system would also help untangle the legal
morass in which the college finds itself, particularly
with: respect to drug laws. The students would be
real people, not sheltered students, and as such would
have the rights and obligations of citizenship.

APRIL 30, 1971

The college has shown an understandable un-

willingness to prosecute drug cases. Last spring’s
case showed that the legal structure on campus can-
not handle such a case without opening the college
to damage suits in the civil courts.

If the college still wishes to help direct student
life, it should take the form of counseling, not dormi-
tory and behavior rules.

And least we forget the student can learn from
his assumption of the obligations as well as the rights
of a lease system. He would be just as responsible
as any other member of society for his actions and
would have to consider his activity in a hopefully

more mature style. |
issions Overhaul

Admissions Overhaul |
It should come as no surprise to anyone that
Davidson is having tyouble attracting students for
next year’s freshman class. Indeed, what is surpris-
ing is that it has taken this long for intelligent high
school seniors to begin to reject their letters of ac-
ceptance from Davidson.
What we are calling into question are the atti-
tudes and: practices of the college’s admissions de-
partment. We cannot deny that statistically the ad-

missions department has been successful in the past, :

for it somehow always seems to attract the exact
number of freshmen needed each year. This year,
however, it appears that things have changed, for
with the deadline for student decisions drawing near,
the number of high school seniors who have made
the 100 dollar deposit to Davidson is lower than us-
ual.

The concern here, therefore, is not with how.
the admissions department is going to attain the

quantity of freshmen needed next year to fill East,
Cannon, and Watts, for we are confident that the
admissions directors will accept enough to reach the
goal of 325 freshmen even if it means lowering
standards and watering down the student body with
mediocre students. Rather, our concern is with why
theStollege is having trouble attracting the best col-
lege prospects.

Unfortunately, Davidson’s admissions depart-
ment has not yet redlized that this is no longer a
country club, and the student body here is not like
it was in the-forties or fifties or even. the sixties,
Davidson can no longer sit back and wait for the best
high school seniors to come here, but instead has
to go out and get them. The people in admissions
dén’t seem to understand this, however, and as a re-
sult recruiting is relatively minimal.

Furthermore, there are numerous reports that
when prospects do come here, they are given a very
poor reception by members of the admissions de-
partment, if an admissions staff member bothers to
receive the prospect at all. Such a charge is grave,
we realize, but there is just too much evidence to
ignore such a gross reality. :

In short, what we are saying ‘is that the David-
son admissions department is not doing its job. This,
and not high tuition or the economic state of the
coufitry, is the primary reason that many of ithe best
high school seniors will not be at Davidson next year,

Alonzo Cohen Does Exist

Despite Frequent Denials

Do you believe in Alonzo
Cohen?

Earl MacCormac and I
were once the only believers,
but Cohen’s fame has been
spreading, and, like, all con-
troversial figures, he has
been subject to many myths.

My first encounter with
Professor Cohen came when
my roommate Jim Philips
shared a Cohen quote which
proved particularly appro
priate for a paper in Dr.
MacCormac’s seminar on
symbol formation.

Since that time Cohen and —

I have become very good
friends and he asked that I
write this column to falsify
the widespread denials of his
existence.

Now proof of someone’s
existence when they aren't
around to assert their own
being is ‘very difficult as
philosophers from Anselm to
Aquinas to Augustine have
long ago shown.

But there are at least
three proofs of Cohen's ex-
istence available to, us:

First there are his works.
The report of Cohen’s. work
on rain forest cultures re-
corded in the hoax issue of
THE DAVIDSONIAN were
false, but Dr. Cohen does
have two books and a jour-
nal article to his credit,
namely ‘‘Semantical Aspects
of Syntax’’ and its sequel,
“Syntactical Aspects -of Se-
mantics,” with the perceptive
article ‘‘Does History Make
Sense?”’

The second proof of Dr.
Cohen's existence is pictured
on this page, a bust of the
professor presented to me by

the artist who is a sister in a
Decatur, Georgia convent.
(Due to the humility of her
order, she must remain
nameless.)

Third, we have the medi-
tations of Alonzo Cohen. The
following penses, heretofore
unpublished, are offered for
your consideration:

1. Mind -is not entity but
process.

2. “Are you good wat  rid-
dles?’’ she asked; he knew
not how to answer. |

3. I have learned that ela-
borate questions
evasion; but willsimple ones
get answers?

4. ‘‘Know thyself'’ the Greek
did say; and who shall in-
troduce me?

5. Write an essay: ‘‘Anatomy
and Cleopatra.”’ :
6. My sleep was ~strangely
disturbed; I dreamed I died
and all my dreams came

LETTER

Students

To the Editor:
A few weeks_ago the ma-
jority of those of us rooming

on first floor Richardson
sponsored a party with a
group of women from ‘a

neighboring institution.

We planned -the party our-
selves, as a residence hall
unit, and for the most part
the party was held on our
hall and in the basement of
the dorm.

It was in the spirit of the
new social system that we
planned this hall party, open-
ing it up to everyone in the
dorm who wanted to attend.

Of Course I'm Well Adjusted

facilitate —

true. |
7. An argument is a rhetor-
ical device.
8. Frederick Nietzsche said
*‘Perhaps Truth is a woman.’
and what pray tell man?
8. Most of my days wasted
recalling joys I have tasted.
9. “I lied to you,"" he con-
fessed; .and, as usual, she
believed him.
10. ‘Cast your bread upon
the water’’ the Bible says:
but on your own you must
learn, the ducks are bound
to eat it.
Finally, Alonzo Cohen has
offered to’ share his epitaph.
Too many cheeks, not enough
chins
Too many lovers, too few
friends

Too much confession, too
much sin

Too hard to Smile. too easy
to grin

Excess is my fatal flaw.

‘Protest

Dean of Students . Will
Terry and Scottie Nichols,
director of student housing,
both endorsed the party since
it was sponsored by a resi-
dence hall unit.

In all, the party cost us
35 dollars (for gas, drinks,
etc.)

Since this party was a re-
sidence hall project, we felt
that the Residence Hall As-
sociation (RH'A) should foot
the bill.

The RHA constitution pro
vides for such aid, the RHA
has the money, and consider-
ing the new emphasis on a
nonexclusive social life on
campus, we felt that the
RHA had an obligation to
reimburse us. After all, there
are few residence hall pro-
Jects on this campus.

However, the RHA, behind
Bill Alexander, felt other-
wise, and refused to’ grant
the 35 dollars to the hall.

This .seems most unfor-
tunate’ to’ us. Not only are
we losing 35 dollars on a
project which should be
Sponsored financially by the
RHA, but we've also become
aware of the fact that the
present Alexander admini-
Stration in the RHA will not
respond to honest and_ le-
gitimate attempts at im-
proving residence hall social
life.
