The women’s basketball team defended its home floor effec-
tively against UNCG on Friday and Elon on Sunday, beating
both teams by scores of 76-50 and 68-54, respectively. These
two wins improve the Wildcats
record to 16-9 overall and 10-4 dur-
ing SoCon play.

Against UNCG, Mercedes
Robinson ’08 began a stellar week
with her 10th double-double. She
scored 20 points and secured 11
boards during the contest.

Kelly Gassie 09 and Danielle
Hemerka ’08 joined Robinson in
double figures; Gassie sank a sea- :
son-high 14 points while Hemerka
drained 12 points to complement six
rebounds.

After jostling for position, the s
Wildcats broke away from the
Spartans with a 10-0 run to establish |
a 27-17 lead which they would pro-
tect successfully for the remainder
of the game. UNCG chipped away
at the lead behind its leading scorer
Kemena Brooks, but after trimming
the lead to 27-23, Gassie and Alex
Thompson 710 stretched the lead *®
back out to 31-23.

The Wildcat defense played par-
ticularly well against UNCG, holding the Spartans to 6-22
shooting from the field in the first half and allowing only nine
points in the final 9:42 of the second half. Due to this lockdown
D, Davidson stretched the lead and earned the 76-50 victory.

The Davidson Wildcats women’s tennis team saw its four-
match winning streak come to a brutal end Saturday against No.
63 Virginia Tech when the Hokies blanked the Wildcats 7-0.
Recovering from this overwhelming loss, the Wildcats secured
their fifth shutout of the season by blanking Radford on Sunday
afternoon.

The Wildcats did not surrender a single point during their
recent winning streak, but were unable to establish much resist-
ance to the Hokie attack.

Virginia Berry ’10 (6-7, 6-4, 7-6 (6)) and Lora Dushanova
’09 (6-1, 0-6, 7-6 (5)) managed to take their singles matches to
three sets, but both fell in third set tiebreakers. Also competing
in singles for the Wildcats were Kelsey Linville ’08 (6-3, 6-2),
Kim Whelan ’08 (6-0, 6-2), Michelle Fanney ’09 (6-4, 6-2) and
Alison Rauh ’11 (6-3, 6-2).

Rauh and Whelan teamed to lose 8-6 in the third doubles
match, surrendering the point to the Hokies. Berry and Linville
(8-3) and Fanney and Teresa Wang °10 (8-1) also competed in
doubles for Davidson but could not turn the tide.

The tables turned on Sunday when Davidson blanked Radford
7-0. Contributions came from every member of the squad. First,
the doubles duos of Linville and Berry secured an 8-5 victory in
No. 1 doubles. Samantha Galainena ’11 paired with experienced
Meredith Skeeters ’08 to win her first collegiate doubles match
8-6 at the No. 3 spot. Wang and Fanney also defeated their dou-
bles opponents 8-3.

The singles matches proved just as successful. The only match
that went to three sets for the "Cats was Skeeters versus Ashton
