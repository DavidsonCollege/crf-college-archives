Michael Jackson's Dangerous:
a Go Ahead, Believe the Hype

. By Jim Carswell

For the lucky few who. have
access to MTV and the misguided
few who listen to Top 40 Radio,
there has been no escape from Mi-
chael Jackson the last few weeks.
He’s everywhere, telling us how
he made the “Thriller” video, ap-
pearing in public with that little
Home Alone kid, and of course

singing Dangerous’s first single”

“Black or White.” It’s been a long
time since his lastalbum came out,
and apparently his PR people have
spared nothing in their effort to
promote this one. They say the
success of Dangerous is vital to
the slumped record industry,
though, so maybe their efforts do
warrant some. justification.
Anyway, the job these people
have done has paid off. Dangerous
debuts at the top position in this
week’s American popcharts, where
it’s already been in England, Spain,
Switzerland, and Australia. And
“Black or White” hit number one
on the singles listin fourteen coun-
tries, including this one, weeksago.
To say the least, this stuff is
popular, and not just because of the
hype or because music-buyers want
their money to go toward more

‘experimental plastic surgery for

Michael. The fact is, Jackson at-
tracts people. He knows popular

‘music, and puts his knowl-

edge to work, It all comes
down to three factors,
which are all evident in
Dangerous.

Mystique People are
interested in Michael
Jackson, and he gives them
what they want... some-
times. Every now and then
the public will get a story
abouthow weird he is -- he
tried to buy the Elephant
Man’sremainsand he used
tosleep in that atmospheric
chamber. It’s all intrigu-
ing, and in some of his
music -- butnot much -- he
begins to answer the ques-
tions people. ask. Songs
like “Leave Me Alone” and
“Man in the Mirror” in the
past hdve hinted at the
motivations behind his
actions. He never offers a
definitive answer though,
and that keeps the masses
buying.

Maybe, just'maybe on’ Dan-
gerous he’ll tell us who he really

‘is. Well, not quite, but on “Will

You Be There” he uses achoir and

‘ searching lyrics to intimate that he’

feels.a lot of doubt and needs faith
in God to live. By the way, the
melody ‘and rhythm. are catchy,

here, though the little prayer at the

end is really annoying. It’s all just

another hook for the inquisitive
public, though.

Message While
he won’ t quite tell you who
he is, he will tell you what
he wants. He headed up
that whole “We Are the
World” thing, and he ech-
oes that song with “Heal
the World” on this album.
Actually, the song is justa
cheap rip-off of the old one,
but you get the same mes-
sage. And really, how can
you can complain about it?
Michael Jackson wants to

. help the world.

That appeals to
people, and it may actually
even help them. “Black or
White” lays down the
message of community
harmony, and that is actu-
ally one of the appealing
aspects of the song. Sure,
he gets alittle overzealous,
as with that rap about “turf
wars, on a global scale”,

but it is nicé to hear a popular
musical act concern himself with
things nicer than murder and hate

and dismemberment.

Music Of course, none of this
would have been possible had
Michael Jackson not made his
reputation with good music. We

all still remember his bubblegum

stuff with the Jackson Five back in
the Seventies, and his solo work
has been huge. Songs like “Billie
Jean” are weak, but he does de-
serve some credit, and Dangerous
compares. well with Bad~ and
Thriller.

“Black or White” is a classic
pop song, from the catchy guitar
riff (played by Slash, by the way)
to the aforementioned message.
And the production is slick. All the
“dahs” and “unhs” are‘in exactly
the right places. See if you don’t
catch yourself humming: it some
time soon. Another keeper is “Why
You Wanna Trip on Me”, which
recalls the good funk the Jacksons
competed. with in the old days. If
you can get past the overbearing
drum, you might even want to
dance to it.

Actually, the ever presentdrum
gets-really old over the course of
side two. “Gone Too Soon” ‘and
“Dangerous” combine to abandon

Southern Fan Support Strong For Drivin N' Cryin

- Calling from his
hotel room, Fuller was friendly
and easy-going. He told the inter-
viewer that he was busy saving the
world playing Atari, but that he
would kindly put aside this noble
pursuit to answer a few questions
about the band.

The first questions were about
the recent Thanksgiving shows in
Atlanta. Fuller explained that they
were fun but hectic with all the

relatives gathered for the holiday. -

Trying to be a family man and a
rock star at the same time was
nerve-racking.

he tried never to think in those
terms. It is best to take the shows
day by day and play the music hard
each time, he said. No perform-
ance is better or worse, just differ-
ent. Herelated that the crowds are

The Davidsonian then asked
some questions about the diverse
range of musical styles Drivin n’
Cryin hasexplored over the course
of theircareer. We wanted to know
why therecentFlyMe Courageous

than the blend of folk, country,and
rock which characterizes theri

ther on DNC’s connection with
R.E.M., Fuller explained that be-
fore joining DNC he had been a
roadie on R.E.M.’s Life’s Rich
Pageant and Document tours and
had even played: rhythm guitar for
them at several shows. Peter Buck
came on stage to play during the
first Thanksgiving show in Atlanta.

DNC seems sick of being asked
questions about or compared with
R.E.M., however. During the last
song at Friday's concert, the band
brought out their road manager,
who has long brown hair, and let

him stand there flailing around with

During Friday’s show Kinney sung

“a song about two native Ameri-

cans looking at Mt. Rushmore.
While there are monuments for
great American leaders, the great
native American chiefs have only
the wide blue sky.

The future plans for Drivin n’
Cryin include finishing the current
tour and then embarking on a Eu-
ropean tour in March and April.
They will work on theirnew album
during the summer and hope to get
it out by September.

develop an overall rock

The message of most Drivin n' Cryin
songs, says Fuller, is to stand up for
yourself and don't be afraid to be your-
self. Many of their songs express envi-
ronmental concerns as well. ‘Our songs
