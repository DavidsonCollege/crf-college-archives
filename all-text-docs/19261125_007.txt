Alumni Secretary Will

IMPERIAL

The alumni secretary has his plans about |
complete for a trip through eastern North |
Carolina, which trip is for the purpose of
organizing alumni associations in several
places where associations look promising and
are needed. It is definitely certain that as- |
sociations will be organized in Raeford and |
Fayetteville on the nights of December Ist |
and 2nd, respectively. Letters have been |
| written to Wilmington with reference to or- |
| ganizing an association there on December |
| 3rd. In the same week, the secretary |
an organization at Concord on Monday night, |
‘and one at Davidson on Tuesday night. This |
makes a total of five organizations in one |
week. Enthusiastic letters have been re- |}
| ceived from Raeford and Fayetteville and it
ij seems about certain that strong associations |
{ will be organized there.

Last Saturday a letter was mailed out to
}all Davidson College alumni, merely setting |
forth the success of Home-coming Day. That |
day was certainly one of the greatest and in|
|many ways the greatest of all days for Da- |

; vidson and hundreds of alumni were present. |
| Another letter will go out the latter part of |
|the week from Dr. J. C, Rowan, president |
| of the Alumni Association, containing a
three months’ report of the alumni  secre-

tary’s work,

personal accomplishments,” said Miss Kath-

cessful outwardly, his life was not a success,
for he ended his life without Christ.
