SENIOR SKETCH NO. 7:

Egyptian Exchange:

In East Dorm hardly anyone has
any tooth-paste left. To be more
exact, in the basement of East no
one has any soap or stationery —
or cigarettes or chewing gum.

These little gems of knowledge
and the fact that Peter John Mason
rooms at B East have a direct rela-
tionship. John would borrow his
grandmother's crutch.

He’s just one of those people of
whom it takes all kinds to make a
world.

But don't misunderstand, John
isn’t tight with his money by any
means. It’s true he’s the only boy
here who writes one and two dollar
checks, but John considers his bor-
rowing all part of his due homage.
For John, an exchange student
with a figure ate, thinks he is a
direct decendent from an Egyptian
Nabob.

He considers the toothpaste a
token of loyalty from his subjects.
At first the hall just played along
with the joke, but now the thing
has mushroomed and he has the
whole dorm believing it. Some of
his scared freshmen lackies are
beginning to wonder if he’s even
a direct decendent.

Nabob misses his homeland. Al-
most every week Professor Eber-
hardt drops by John’s room where
the two will spend hours talking
about Egypt. But nothing takes
John tack to his childhood as well
as the safaries he occasionally
goes on in darkest Black River.

Over the Christmas holidays he
went hunting there for three days
and all he killed was a sparrow
and two fifths. He didn’t mention
the other three fifths of the spar-
row.

It took Nabob quite a while to
get used to Davidson — or rather

for Davidson to get use to Nabob.
At last he says he has the school
pretty well organized and regi:
mented. He himself, of course, is
the generalissimo.

B. T. Craig was harem guard,
but just wasn’t cut out for the
job and has been replaced by
handyman Ashby. D. Davis has

been turned out to pasture. Ac-
tually the chain of command has
only one link — the generalissimo
is all-supreme.

Nabob hinted that big plans lie
in his future. On his next birthday:

Mrs. French, Smith’s Secretary
One Of Union’s Foremost Assets

Perhaps one of the chief rea-
sons students are finding the Stu-
dent Union a friendlier and more
enjoyable place than ever to go
and take their friends is an attrac-
tive young lady named Mrs. French.

She has been serving as the new
Secretary-Hostess at the Union
since Spring holidays, and her sin-
cere interest in every student who
comes in is enough to make her
one of the best assets that the
Union has.

This reporter had cnly bcen
talking to the lovely new addition
to the college staff for a few
minutes, when he realized that
here was a snappily dressed young
woman who combined brains and
beauty with flawless manners and
a charming personality of extreme
graciousness.

Despite Mrs. French’s modest in-
sistence that there was nothing of
interest to tell about herself, it
turned out that she was wrong 1n
this respect. She has lived in David-
son practically all of her life and
graduated from high school here.

It is rumored that at one time
she was one of that small group
of co-eds, who were undoubtedly
the most healthy segment of the
student body.

Her background and training for
the new job has been very good.
Mrs. French attended business
school in Charlotte and since then
has been employed by several com-
panies and firms, the most recent
of which was Ivey’s, where she
was Personnel Director, and Lance
Incorporated, where her husband
is now employed.

Already within the relatively
short time she has been here, Mrs.
French has been praised greatly by
faculty members and visitors for
the fine way in which she js serv-
ing as official hostess at the Union.
Davidson is indeed fortunate to
have her on its staff and welcomes
her most cordially.

Siqama Upsilon...
(Continued From Page One)

Last fall the fraternity added
the names of Bob Mitchell and Dr.
_B. D. Thompson to its roll, and
they are also to be initiated at this
time.

Election of officers for 1953-54
will take place on May 7, as this
is the last planned meeting of the
fraternity for this year.

Composed of student, faculty and
administration men, Sigma Upsilon
meets every other week in the
school year and has been this year
under the leadership of Mac Bulgin
as president. ,

During the course of its meetings
the members hear and criticize
original works of literature and
has as another of its main func-
tions constructive and disinterested
observation of the Davidson scene.

CAT TALES:

FRIDAY, APRIL 24, 1953

Continued From Page 3} BROWN SAYS WRITERS

Tennis is no longer a minor sport as is recognized by the
fact that the bigger universities and colleges and even a few
of the smaller ones with a lot of money are building terrifically
large and expensive tennis setups and are playing up the

sport.

Taking a look at the Cats opponent tomorrow on the
courts over at Chapel Hill, we see some of the most expensive
tennis setups anywhere in this part of the country. The setup
is much the same at P.C., Duke, Miami and many others of the

Cats’ opponents.

We're not crying about the usual old gripe around David-
son of lack of subsidization, but are merely seeking to point
out the fact that the Wildcat Tennis squad is really doing a
great job and are due a lot of praise. Only one of the Cats
has any kind of financial help from the college.

They have really been putting out a brand of tennis in
the last few matches which is something to watch and the fans
can count on the same kind of matches in the future. In the
next couple of weeks the Cats face some mighty tough com-
petition here at home in the regular season and will take part
in the Southern Conference tournament here on the 14th, 15th,

and 16th of next month.

We would like to také this opportunity to say to Coach
McKee and his team (Keesler, Bremer, Clark, Dudley, Snead,

year. Lacy defeated Joanny in the
finals of the North Carolina Inter-
scholastic tournament in both
Bremer’s junior and senior years.

The likable president of the
Kappa Sigma fraternity hails from
Wilmington, N. C., where he at-
tended New Hanover high school.
Though he played tennis all
through high school he has never
had a private lesson. All the tennis
Johnny knows has either been
picked up through his school
coaches or through his own hard
work.

SEEK TO FIND TRUTH

The next time Vance Mizell in-
troduces a speaker, he certainly
won't let the gentlemen know he
is from Georgia. John Mason Brown
seemed to think that “the fuzz
must have worn off the Georgia
peach” after leaving Mizell’s not-
too-southern brogue.

Such a statement was typical of
the manner in which Brown ex-
pressed himself Wednesday night
in Chambers Auditorium before
one of the largest crowds that has
attended a lecturer this year.

As the central theme for his talk
Mr. Brown kept coming back to the
fact that great writers are always
seeking a means of giving expres-
sion to truth. One of his early
points was that an artist must stick
his neck out in order to get any-
where in interpreting truth, where-
upon Mr. Brown stuck his own neck
out with the comment that, “Writ-
ers may even be members of the
human race.” :

To John Mason Brown there are
four recurrent themes in all great
literature — themes which also
repeat themselves daily in real
life — They are: 1 How man must
find some way of living with him-
self. II How man must find some
way of living with his neighbor.
Il] How man must find some way
of living with the world beyond
his neighbor. TV How man must
find some way of living with his
God. Today we find one further
theme: V How, can man in these
uncertain days maintain his inner
serenity and at the same time his
outward dignity. ;

Mr. Brown then spoke of several
contemporary works which he be-
lieved best lent expression to these

questions and sought some reason-
able answer. George B. Shaw's
“Bon Juan in Hell” drew his most

favorable comments — particularly |

as presented by Charles Laughton,
Agnes Morehead, Charles Boyer,
and Sir Cedric Hardwicke.

One of the fallacies of the Ameri-
can reader, according to Brown, is
his unfounded belief that reading
a book once is enough. To prove
his point he brought out the fact
that one doesn’t listen to a great
musical work just once. Likewise
a good book should be read again
and again and again.

Brown expressed his admira-
tion for a college age that goes
right ahead with life and work
knowing full well, though actually
not knowing at all, what lies ahead
in this cold-war-hot-peace world
of ours.

On Senator McCarthy, Brown
stated his vehement disapproval
of methods of investigation ‘that
assumed a man to be guilty till
proven innocent. Personally he be-
lieved that our love for this coun-
try and its tradition should out-
weigh our hatred of communism.

Don’t you want to try a cigarette
with a record like this?

I. THE QUALITY CONTRAST between Chesterfield and other leading cigarettes is

a revealing story. Recent chemical analyses give an index of good quality for the :
country’s six leading cigarette brands.

The index of good quality table—a ratio of high sugar to low nicotine=-
shows Chesterfield quality highest

..- 15% higher than its nearest competitor and Chesterfield quality 31% higher than
the average of the five other leading brands.
