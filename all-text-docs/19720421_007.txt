Ray Swetenburg takes his first of 252 points in the Davidson Relays.

Swetenburg Paces Runners
To Third Place In Relays

By JOE EARLE
Sports Editor

It has often been said that
track at Davidson can be boiled
down to Ray Swetenburg.

Last weekend Swetenburg
proved this dramatically by
scoring 25% points in the Da-
vidson relays and leading the
Cats to a third place in the
relays.

In the process, Swetenburg al-
so added another mark to his
string of records.

Swetenburg now holds David-
son records in the triple jump,
the high hurdles, most points in
one meet, most points in Da-
vidson relays, most points in
one season and most career
points.

Swetenburg seemed to be ev-
erywhere in the Relays, taking
three firsts, one second and one
third during the course of the
afternoon.

ANOTHER FIRST
Tommy Richardson wins his
heat of the 100-yd. dash.

He took first places in the
triple jump, the 120-yd high
hurdles, and shared with Dave
Peaco, Greg Love and Bob
Trumbo a first in the shuttle
hurdle relay.

The Relays were very close
and tense, according to Heath
Whittle, coach of the Davidson
thinclads.

“Any of the top five teams
could have won the meet,” he
said. “It all depended on the
last few events.”

Davidson, Cumberland and
West Georgia took the Relays
to the wire to find a winner. All
had roughly equal points going
into the last events of the meet,
the relays.

West Georgia took three firsts
in the relays, but Cumberland’s
seconds, linked with their im-
pressive field events were
enough to give them 78 points
to win the meet.

West Georgia took a_ close
second with 73 points with Da-
vidson third at 60.

The Cats also fought out a
close meet with Wake Forest
last Tuesday.

The Davidson team fell to the
Deacons 78-66 in what Whittle
called ‘‘a_ very, very close
meet.”

“It was tied 66-66 going into
the mile relay,” Whittle stated.
“We didn't really have a mile
relay team ready so we en-
ered a pick-up team. They won,
and won the meet.”

Swetenburg led the team in
the Wake meet, also, and rack-
ed up a first in the 100-yd. dash,
along with his usual events.

Tommy Richardson was ill
and not able to run in the meet,
and Swetenburg filled in his po-
sition in the 100-yard dash.

Suiprisingly, Swetenburg did
not take his usual first in the
triple jump. He scratched after
his first jump when he hurt his
leg.

Whittle also complimented
the achievements of Woody Van
Meter and Rick Bell, both fresh-
men.

According to Whittle, Van
Meter has been pole vaulting
around 13 feet for the thinclads,
while Bell, a distance runner,

won the mile run at Wake with
a time of 4:23.9.

Whittle said he is ‘very pleas-
ed with their progress.”

Against Wake Forest the Cats
also took first, second and third
in the 440-yd. hurdles with the
runs of Ted Ellett, Steve Still
and Peaco.

Skippers Favored

In SAISA Regatta
On Lake Norman

By DAVID MELTON
Staff Writer

This Saturday, Davidson hosts
the South Atlantic Inter-Collegi-
ate Sailing Association Cham-
pionships at the Lake Campus
on Lake Norman.

Commodore Jim Hunter char-
acterized the team by saying
“This is the strongest team Da-
vidson’s ever had.”

Other teams entered in the
field are The Citadel, Old Do-
minion, College of Charleston,
Clemson, Duke, University of
South Carolina, University of
Tennessee, University of Vir-
ginia and Georgia Tech.

Hunter said that The Citadel,
Clemson, Tennessee and David-
son are the four top teams en-
tered.

Starters for the Wildcats will
be Jim Hunter as skipper with
Frank Somerville as crew in
Division A; Allen Lundy as
skipper with John McElveen as
crew in Division B; and Clem-
ent Roussenq as skipper with
Tom King as crew in the top
reserve position.

Hunter revealed that he is
‘pleased with the last part of
the season.” The Wildcats took
first place at the University of

Virginia Regatta and second
place at Duke, in their last {wo
performances.

Hunter praised the team by
saying “The team has been do-
ing a lot of work getting the
boats in shape and everything
lined up.” He also added that
they have been practicing five
days a week.

Allen Lundy received special
commendation in that he ‘thas
been sailing really well.”

Hunter was also quick to point
out that Hallam Walker, the
Sailing coach, has spent much
time with the team and has —
done a fine job as coach.

Hunter feels that Davidson
has a good chance to win the
regatta. ‘“‘We have an advan-
tage in sailing our own boats,”
he said.

The winner gains eligibility
for a trip to the nationals in
San Diego. This may be the best
chance for the Wldcats to pros-
per because next year only one
of the top six skippers will re-
turn.

All of the teams entered in
the regatta will use Davidson's
“Jet-14s” in the competition.
The home team supplies the
boats in all SAISA regattas.

Allen To Face Hometown Foes

By HOWARD BOYD
Asst. Sports Editor~

When the Davidson tennis
team meets George Washington
and Navy this weekend, Bill
Allen will be putting much more
than just his 12-4 singles record
cu the line.

Allen, a sophomore from Alex-
andria, Va., is tied with Gary
Bressler for the top winning
percentage on the team.

Allen plays in the number two
position on the Cats, and amaz-
ingly, both of his singles op-
ponents this weekend are old
hometown rivals of his.

John Damon of GWU ‘“‘lives
across the street from me,” Al-
len said, ‘‘and he was kind of a
teacher of mine.”

Navy’s number two man, Kev-
in Miller, played against Allen
for three years in high school.
The two played for prep arch-
rivals.

Allen would dearly love to win
these two backyard battles, but
he expects tough matches from
both teams as the Cats attempt
to improve their 7-9 season
mark.

Wednesday Southern Confer-
ence favorite Furman halted
the Cats three-match win streak
9-0.

Last weekend the fuzzballers
ripped Richmond and VMI by
identical 9-0 scores, and Monday
knocked off Pfeiffer 8-1, for
their longest victory skein of
the season.

Allen, after being a prep and
junior standout, had to make
several major adjustments in
college, especially to the com-
petition and different court com-
position.

“I grew up on hard courts,

where you play ‘serve and vol-
ley.’ In college on clay I’ve had
to switch, use more finesse and
Stay in the backcourt more. My
style was hampered.”

On hard surfaces, such as the
ones in Williamsburg, Va., site
of the conference tournament,
“I like to hit a hard serve and
look for an opportunity to come
to the net,” Allen added.

Traditionally, according to Al-
len, ‘“‘Davidson has had clay-
court-type teams. We haven’t
lost on hard courts this year, so

maybe we're a_ hard-court
team.”

If so, the team’s chances will
be improved in the conference,
as they attempt to defend their
crown they have won for the
past three years.

After this weekend’s matches,
the netters host High Point on
Monday and Sewanee on Wed-
nesday.

The Foglemen have only
three more matches after that
before the conference, which is
slated for May 4-6.
