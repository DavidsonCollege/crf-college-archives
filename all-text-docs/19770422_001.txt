Court approves dramatic reforms

By KEVIN WHITE
Staff Writer

The Patterson Court Council this
week passed two self-selection reform
proposals in a first step toward a
dramatic reorganization of David-
son’s social structure.

Greg Anders’ proposal, giving the
national fraternities on Patterson
Court the right to issue formal written
bids, was passed in a controversial
vote Sunday night.

The vote was twelve ‘‘yes’’, seven
“no” and one abstention with SAE,
Phi Delts, KA, Rusk and ETC issuing
two votes each in favor, F&M,
Emanon and ATO unanimously ag-
ainst.

PAX split their vote, one in favor
and one against while PIKA voted
one ‘‘yes’’ and abstained in their
second vote.

PCC Wednesday night also passed
a proposal submitted by Bruce Brown

and Tim Wilkins of F&M which deals

specifically with reform of the self-sel-
ection system applicable only to the
eating houses.

Those two proposals will be sent to

the sub-committee on Campus and
Religious Life for further action.

In other actions, three proposals,
including a computerization system, a
combination bid/self-selection system
applicable to all houses, and a lottery
system of self-selection, were soundly
defeated by the Council.

The Anders’ proposal, in its final
amended version, establishes a separ-
ate bid system applicable only to
national fraternities on the Court.

Specifically, social functions of all
houses would be open throghout fall
term. During the second week of
winter term, students would choose in
which system they would like to
participate, either bid or self-select.

This coincides with the issuance of
Fiji bids and would allow future Fiji
pledges the option of self-selection.

Formal rush by each fraternity
would then commence culminating in
bids being delivered sometime before
the self-selection process.

Freshmen who entered the bid
system but failed to win a bid would
then fall behind the self-select people
in choosing an eating house. Any

spaces in national fraternities not
filled by bids will then be filled
through the normal self-selection
process.

To guarantee full use of all facilities
and to help alleviate overcrowding,
each house must specify a minimum
of freshmen to be taken in before the
end of fall term.

F&M’s proposal for self-selection
would keep it very similar to the way
it functions now.

The number of people in early
random now would be limited to a
maximum of five. To avoid last
minute encouragement or harrass-
ment, non-position individuals would
sit at each house’s table to put the
student’s name on the final sign-up
sheet. House members could remain
in Love Auditorium for further ques-
tions or problems.

Immediate controversy engulfed
the pro-Anders proposal vote. Russ
Martin, Treasurer of Emanon, typi-
fied the opinion of the houses op-
posed: ‘‘The vote of 12 to 7 with one
abstention is not representative of the
entire Patterson Court at all. It’s

simply a poll of twenty people.”’

The controversy revolved around
three questionable ‘‘yes’’ votes, two
by ETC and one by PAX.

These houses charged that their
representatives at the meeting did not
express the majority opinion of that
house. The Council decided that it
would allow each house to submit to
the Council a position paper, expres-
sing the majority will of that house.

These papers, along with one
summary pro-position and one sum-
mary con-position, would be sent with
the proposal to the sub-committee for
further evaluation. The vote remained
19-95%,

The deadline for action for the
sub-committee of the Council on
Campus and Religious Life is October
1977. One member expressed little
hope for actions before the end of this
acacemic year.

Kathryn Bridges, PCC President,
felt that all parties can be repre-
sented. ‘‘I hope anyone unhappy with
the Anders’ proposal will be pleased
that dissenting opinions will also go
before the sub-committee.

“The court is split, and all opinion
will be fairly represented. The issue is
not dead and I encourage any student
with other proposals to submit them
to the PCC for consideration.’’

Convocation boycott in protest

Vol. LXVI, No. TWENTY-THREE Davidson College, Davidson, N.C. 28036 :

Spencer rescinds job offer
from Jewish Professor

By CATHERINE LANDIS

A prospéctive faculty mem-
ber’s invitation to join the
faculty was rescinded by Col-
lege President Samuel R.
Spencer, Jr., because the pro-
fessor, a member of the Jewish
religion, indicated his objec-
tions to the college’s policy of
hiring based on such non-aca-
demic standards as Christian
commitment.
Protest boycott
In response, students and
faculty plan to boycott Fri-
day’s Convocation exercises.
After reviewing 190 applica-
tions the political science de-
partment invited two candi-
dates to Davidson to be inter-
viewed by both students‘ and
faculty. The department un-
animously chose Dr. Ronald
Linden, a professor from
Swarthmore College, and re-
commended Linden to Spencer
who then interviewed him.
Informed of tenure policy
Spencer informed Linden
about the Christian tenure
policy inthe By-Laws of the
College - Constitution. Linden
had not previously: been aware
of the policy before his inter-
view with Spencer.
~ Linden offered job
Spencer offered Linden the
job because, as what Dr.

‘‘His credentials were quite
impressive. He has a Ph.D.
from Princeton University.
His training was suited for the
courses we needed for him to
teach, specifically internation-
al and Soviet policy.”

Proctor added, ‘“‘He seems
to have the sort of personality
which would have made him a
productive teacher and an
excellent: scholar.’

Spencer’s lette: included a
paragraph expressing his con-
cern as to whether or not
Linden would be willing to
teach at a school with a strong
Christian commitment. He
wrote that Linden should not
accept the job unless he. gen-
uinely wished to uphold and

support college policy. This
wording appears in all letters
from the college offering em-
ployment.

Job offer accepted

Linden accepted the job
offer. At the same time he
turned down job offers at
other schools. In his letter to
Spencer, however, he stated
his objections to the col-
lege’s hiring and firing pol ic-
ies.

Spencer interpreted the ob-

initial acceptance in the first of
Linden’s letters. According to
the Constitutional By-Laws,
‘The President shall be re-
sponsible to the Trustees for
being certain that each person
employed as a member of
faculty and staff, at the time
of his or her appointment, is
fully aware of and supports
the purpose ofthe college as
set forth in the Davidson
College Constitution, and it
prepared conscientiously to
uphold and seek to increase its
effectiveness as a church-rela-
ted college.”

“No contract reached”’

Because of Linden’s re-
sponse Spencer was unsure of
Linden’s support of the Con-
stitution. He conferred with
Trustee and lawyer Larry
Daggenhart who ruled that no
contract had been reached.
Daggenhart then advised
Spencer to withdraw his offer
to Linden.

Job offer withdrawn

Spencer informed Proctor of
his decision after speaking to
Daggenhart, but before send-
ing the withdrawal to Linden.

The political science depart-
ment will now go back to the
original applications and in-
vite the next qualified candi-
date to Davidson for an inter-
view. ‘ah

‘Language is not a bar-

classes are held in English
and the students all speak
English in addition to their
regional languages,’’ she
explained.

Fields of study available
to students will be econo-
mics, history, English,
math, chemistry, physics

manner similar to the pro-
