One Step Forward

While headlines tell of such daring
innovations as a bus for taking fresh-
men to Queens and a spot box for the
entire student body, the Student Coun-
cil is quietly embarking on a project
that has been promised by aspiring
candidates for years, but without any
concrete results.

The project. a student-conducted
faculty evaluation. promises a signifi-
cant step forward in student partici-
pation in academic life of the college.

The evaluation will poll students
for opinions of professors’ teaching
methods and effectiveness. after which
the tabulated results will be available
to individual professors. Except for
those involved in the actual coordina-
tion of the project, the professors
alone will see the results and no pos-
sible embarrassment could come to
him. ,

Other schools have adopted a num-
ber of different plans for faculty

evaluation, including printed books
which are made available to all stu-
dents. giving frank evaluations of
every course and every professor. The
council is wise to have started its pro-
gram on a less ambitious, if more
realistic, plane. Hopefully, when this
experiment is well off the ground,
later councils can expand the program
to offer information to students as
well as faculty.

Because of the confidential nature
of the planned report, there is no ex-
cuse for any. professor’s refusal to
cooperate with the council; indeed, to
do so would be to-indicate an intran-
sigence-that has no place in the at-
mosphere of a modern educational
institution.

Just as important is the need for
student cooperation. The report will
have no place for petty personal com-
plaints against professors for low
grades and the like.

Towards A Christian Orientation

With vespers gone, the college is
doing nothing officially to explore the
meaning af the Christian faith and its
applications to today’s world. While
the vesper service was in reality more
a symbol of the college’s Christian
commitment than an actual forum for
thought and debate, it occasionally
brought in free-thinking individuals
who had escaped traditional lines of
thought.

But in the meantime, there has de-
veloped since last spring a meaning-
ful avenue of thought provocation on
the school’s role as a Christian liberal
arts college. Concerned members of
St. Alban’s Episcopal Church, many
of whom are connected with the col-
lege as employes but who as a group
are independent of the school, have
produced a number of programs rais-
ing vital questions about the nature

of a church-related college.

A reading of W. B. Yeats’ The
Resurrection provided last week the
focal point of a discussion to mark
the church’s latest venture into ques-
tioning Davidson’s role in the twen-
tieth century. But the play was only
the latest in a number of programs
that have included a debate among
four faculty members, a series of
sermons directed towards the academ-
ic life and another play.

As an independent group, the
church is free to explore a number of
sensitive areas that a college-spon-
sored program might shrink from.

Until and even after the college de-
termines the outward form its Chris-
tian commitment will take, St. Alban’s
is performing an invaluable function
to the community as a whole in help-
ing it to orient itself to today’s world.

Into The World

One of the most valuable aspects of
a liberal college education comes in
the opportunity to meet outside fig-
ures brought in for speeches and ques-
tioning. Such programs as the Rey-
nolds Lectures and the YMCA Forum
bring to Davidson diverse individuals
who can pronounce ideas rarely heard
at parochial Davidson.

But the effectiveness of such speak-
ers has often been wasted, for reasons
‘such as inadequate planning and
scanty publicity. Last year’s Y Forum,
entitled “Prospects for Man,” brought
viewpoints of outstanding figures from
the fields of news-politics, economics,
theology and _religion-literature.
Spaced throughout a semester, each
speaker approached the problem from
his respective viewpoint in order to
allow students to gain a synthesized
perspective of the next 50 years.

Yet, few community members were
aware of the basic continuity of the
four different speakers; each appear-
ed as “just another chapel speaker.”

Davidson could multiply the effec-
tiveness of its speakers immensely by
sponsoring a symposium. bringing a
number of speakers to the campus
during a concentrated period, to speak
on and discuss a central theme. Last
year these columns pointed to such a
program as an effective means of re-
moving the “deadly cloak of provin-
cialism” for which the college is some-
times known.

Other Southern schools, such as
Virginia Tech, Vanderbilt, Randolph-

Equality For All

The anti-discrimination cause has
reached a new pinnacle (or depth, de-
pending on one’s viewpoint). An As-
sociated Press story told last week of
a growing dissatisfaction in the female
branches of the Army over the seem-
ing lack of opportunities for advance.
Will there soon be Gen. Uplift? the
article asked, referring to the fact
that women army officers may not
presently advance past the rank of
major.

Now we're all for equality — if men
can be generals, let’s allow the women
the same privilege (7). After all, isn’t
discrimination by sex cutlawed these
days?

But then, why stop there? The

Macon Woman’s College, Emory and

UNC-CH . have hosted figures such’

as Roy Wilkins, Norman Thomas, Bar-
ry Goldwater, John Kenneth Galbraith
and Tom Woolfe for symposiums on
vital topics—-race relations, Viet Nam,
America’s global challenge and Amer-
ican conservatism.

The problems of planning and co-
ordinating such a program are stag-
fering, and to be successful work on
the program must begin immediately
for a symposium to be held in 1968.

Sought-after speakers _plan their
engagements months in advance. One
Reynolds Lecturer visiting here last
spring, when asked to recommend pos-
sible speakers for the 1966-67 year,
could list none that would be available
less than a year in advance. The prob-
lems are compounded in trying to
bring several speakers at the same
ime.

Not only are speakers difficult to
secure — they are also expensive.
While the Y is the likeliest group for
sponsoring and organizing such an
event, they have not the financial re-
sources to make such an enterprise
successful. Reynolds Lecture funds, if
they could be merged with the Y pro-
gram, could’ be much more effectively
utilized to the benefit of the entire
college community.

It makes little sense to have a num-
ber of different organizations compet-
ing for speakers, when they could, by
coordinating dates and speakers, make
each speaker much more meaningful.

women are all for gaining an equal
footing in the armed forces, so let’s
give it to them. Not only should they
be able to reach the top, they should
have the experience of starting from
the bottom, including the privilege of
being drafted.

There is certainly nothing that
uniquely qualifies males for such
clerical tasks as typing and filing.
There are millions of draft-age young
women floating around just looking
for an opportunity to serve their
country in such capacities.

And besides, what better place could
there be for meeting eligible young
men

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Freshmen Defend Subsidized Athletics

Dear Editor:

After reading the editorial
“Time For a Change.” which
advocates the policy of switch.
ing to a non-subsidized athlet-
ic program, I am hardly con-
vinced that such a_ change
would “be a major step in
making the college one of the
most outstanding liberal arts
schools in the country.”

In the first place, Davidson
already has that status. and is
undoubtedly THE outstanding
liberal arts college in the
South.

Furthermore, there are sev-
eral advantages of a subsidiz-
ed athietic program which we
would lose if the switch were
made to a non subsidized pro-
gram.

First. the present program
produces a great deal of school
spirit, which in turn produces
a high student body morale.
The present program, ‘includ-
ing the basketball and foot:
ball teams which have reach-
ed ‘heights undreamed of ten
years ago.’’ has produced this
spirit, for we have’ entered
into “big-time” athletic com-
petition, certainly far more ex-
citing than the competition of
a non-subsidized program.

If we were to enter into
‘“‘small-time’’ competition stu-
dent interest and attendance
would decline, thus crippling a
large part of the morale.

Another loss we would en-
counter by entering into such
a@ program is the tremendous
amount of favorable publicity
received from the success of
the teams, mainly basketball.
If Davidson is to grow, it
must continue to receive pub-
licity, which could not be pro-
duced by a mon-subsidized ath-
letic program.

A third advantage of the
subsidized program is the gate
received from the games in
Charlotte. There is a near-ca-
pacity crowd at all the basket-
ball games played in Char-
lotte, and sellouts at many of
them.

If a non-subsidized athletic
program were to go into ef-
fect, the competition were on
a lower level, attendance
would decline at these games,
and a considerable amount of
money would be lost. In order
to grow, Davidson needs mon-
ey, and the present athletic
program is one source.

I must admit that I can
come up with no alternative
to the proposal, but I feel that
such a step is unnecessary in

order for the school to grow.
It is my opinion that it would
not be as beneficial to the
school as it would be harmful.
MAC DAVIS
Davidson College

Dear Editor:

I am a freshman football
player on an athletic grant-
in-aid and wish to say that I
feel scholarships are a neces-
sity if Davidson is to field
respectable athletic teams in
the future. I do not think that
these scholarships are detri-
mental to the progress of Da-
vidson.

The day of the ‘dumb
bruiser's”’ getting a scholar-
ships is passed, especially
at Davidson. For a guy to get
a scholarship at Davidson
today he must be an oufstand-
ing student as well as an
above average athlete. and
the scholarship is not granted
until the athlete is accepted
by the college.

Several of the guys on our
team could have gone to the
big universities for more
money than they are recejv-
ing here at Davidson now,
but they, like myself, wanted
to be a part of the unique
combination of academic ex-
cellence and a growing ath-
letic program.

I am proud to be a part
of the growing football tradi-
tion at Davidson College, and
hope that: the trustees will see
the contribution that. athletics
has made to the college, and
will appropriate money in or-
der to continue to attract the
student-athlete to Davidson.

I hope that since 42 per cent
of this year's freshman class
failed the athletic proficiency
test, the Admissions Office
will think twice about taking
the egghead over the student-
athlete.

Prohibition End

Dear Editor:

My fellow countryman, Ber-
nard Hollowood, once referred
to Davidson students as Titans
of the Great Society. One of
the powers of a Titan is that
he. should be able to resist
temptation, so why not have a
bit of tempting?

Let’s face it, Davidson, the
place where anything you do
twice is termed tradition, is
not exactly the mecca of ‘so-
cial activity. Nor is it really a
den of vice and iniquity. 1

mean. to say a Hootenanny,
pleasant as it may be for the
aspiring Bob Dylans amongst
us, is hardly likely to make
you burst out into a cold sweat
of deep-rooted enthusiasm, is
it? So, Devils of the Deep.
arise!—I dare you to tempt
me,

Why not a Communist so-
ciety, or maybe John Birch or
a Hitler youth movement? At
least we can throw things at
them in place of those inces-
sant Beanie cap raids: Why
not a branch of the Ku Klux
Klan: we can all dress up
for that. There really ought
to be a bit more to release the
hidden desire in many of us
to become a Red Guard.

I feel we could make a start
by getting rid of that unspeak-
able prohibition law: sure it’s
fine for the D.A.R. and the
Temperance Society—but for
us Titans? No, no, better we
allow the infernal liquid on
campus. And to Hell if some
of us find we're not so Titanic.

Seamans Blasts
‘Dixie’ Ban
Dear Editor:

Although I realize full well
the danger of not being taken
seriously by writing letters to
the editor too frequently, I
must nonetheless speak out on
a topic that has affected me
personally since the last issue
of THE DAVIDSONIAN.

I refer to the absence of the

playing of ‘‘Dixie’’ during the
first time-out of last week's
Furman - Davidson football
game, which Davidson (signif-
icantly?) lost.
‘I have been a member for
three years of the band which
has traditionally played ‘‘Dix-
ie.” At first, I too was grossed
out by the ludicrousness of it
all. But then I came to realize,
in my role as bandsman, that
““Dixie’’ was being played not
because the South will rise
again, but because the strains
of that tune are conducive to
school spirit.

To think that. Davidson stu-
dents cheer when “Dixie’’ is
played because of repressed
racism or a desire to over-
throw society is to betray a
gross ignorance of the thoughts
and feelings of the Davidson
student body (this may not be
such an inaccurate portrayal
of the athletic department any-
way.)

As the professors say, I wish
to make my position abun-

‘Foolish Inconsistencies’
Dominate Viet Politics

By PAUL A. MARROTTE
Assoclate Professor of History

Inspired by a cartoon cap-
tion in the current issue of
Saturday Review, I wish to
develop some thoughts on the
military conflict in Viet Nam.
under the heading, *‘A foolish
consistency shows the work of
a small miind.”

What a compelling commen-
tary this is on the various
“consistencies” which now
dominate the power politics
and policies on all sides in the
war in Viet Nam.

It is probable that several
of the consistent policies of
the -governments and officials
arrayed against each other in
Viet Nam are not only foolish
but unreservedly insane. More
than one major war in mod-
ern history has stemmed from
such insanity. It could happen
again.

CONSISTENCIES CLARIFIED

The consistencies in the war
in Viet Nam have been clari-
fied during the past 15 months.
Perhaps the most significant is
the determination of the Unit-
ed States government to com-
mit at least enough armed
forces to prevent a military
victory by the Viet Cong and
the North Vietnamese army.

This has been demonstrated
by the unceasing build-up of
American armed power with-
in South Viet Nam and the
daily bombings of North Viet
Nam, both designed to oppose
the continued infiltration of
North Vietnamese troops who
openly support the Viet Cong.

Another consistency in the
war is the policy of the North
Vietnamese government in
supporting the Viet Cong in
the South. This has been going
on for a decade but only with-
in the past 15 months has it
been open and undenied as
demonstrated by the opera-
tions of the regular units of

“the North Vietnamese army.
REFUSAL TO NEGOTIATE
A third consistency is the re-
fusal of ‘‘both sides" in the
conflict to negotiate, except
en terms which deny the prin-
ciple of negotiation. Several
years ago, with the Saigon re-
gimes near collapse and mili-
tary defeat, the Hanoi govern-
ment offered ‘impossible’
terms to end the fighting.
Now. with the immense mil-
itary build-up, President John-
son. Secretary of State Rusk
and UN Ambassador Goldberg
have repeatedly offered to ne-
gotiate an end to the conflict
on terms which would insure
the continuation of an anti-
communist government in Sai-
gon.
This the North Vietnamese
reject, for reasons best known
to themselves. For most of the
past five years the Hanoi gov-
ernment has rightly believed
it could achieve military vic-
tory in South Viet Nam, which
success would make negotia-
tions unnecessary.

FOOLISH BELIEF

Conceivably, in 1966, the Han-
oi government still believes
(foolishly it will achieve even-
tually the military victory
which was twice denied it:
once in 1954 when a truce fol-
lowed the stupendous victory
over the French at Dienbien-
phu, and again in 1964, before
the build-up of American fore-
es.

There is no way to judge ac-
curately the present views of
the Hanoi officials on this
point. More than likely the
present military policies of
North Vietnam are tied in
closely with the consistencies
of the Chinese communists.

The consistencles of Com-
munist China's policies to-
wards the war in Viet Nam are
also clear, but only in hind-
sight. These policies are not

likely to change, except to the
detriment of the United States.
DIRE CONSEQUENCES

The Peking government has
consistently opposed any peace
negotiations which might leave
an anti-communist regime in
Saigon. My guess is that the
Chinese officials have threat-
ened North Viet Nam with
dire consequences if Hanoi ac-
cepts the present American
(or other non-communist) of-
fers to negotiate an end to
the conflict.

These consequences probably
include a threat to send Chi-
nese military units into North
Viet Nam. Ho Chi Minh had

his ‘fill’ of Chinese troops

when the Nationalist Chinese
army of Chiang Kai-shek occu-
pied North Viet Nam for six
months immediately after
World War II.

Under this line of reasoning
Ho Chi Minh prefers the de-
Struction of his transportation
and fuel storage facilities to
the loss of independence which
would accompany occupation
by Chinese communist forces.

PEKING RESPONSIBLE?

But if this interpretation
seems remote, the reader must
seriously consider the proba-
bility that the Peking regime
is in some direct way respon-
sible for Hanoi’s willingness to
accept this daily devastation
wrought by American bomb-
ers.

Finally, which of these con-
sistencies is the “foolish'' one,
the work of a weak mind? In
answering this question for
yourself, let me suggest that
it is not just a matter of
“where one stands’ on the
war in Viet Nam, but more
importantly, how realistic one
will allow himself to be when
he interprets the mass of in-
formation (much of it  con-
flicting) available from a va-
riety of world-wide sources.

dantly clear. I applaud mean-
ingful, substantive efforts to
‘move Davidson into the 20th
century. But why forbid the
playing of ‘‘Dixie''?

The college (here I assume
that the college controls the
athletic department; there are
those who, affirm the opposite)
should concentrate its efforts
on wooing Negro students as
assiduously as..it woos Negro

cruit Negro faculty members,
(I don’t think there’s a white-
ness vow.) But why forbid
something as harmless as the
playing of “Dixie?”

In the word of Hal Dial,
“Davidson is supposed to be a
small, Southern college. Now
it's just.a small college. What
will it be next: just a college
or just a small?”

Fools’ Faces

A Student Voice

THE SCENE has been and will be much the same
at colleges all over the United States during this aca-
demic year: a very large crowd of angry or solemn-
looking young people marching or listening to a very
persuasive speaker. An observer might think, espe-
cially in our day, that this gathering would be to
promote the cause of civil rights. But he would prob-
ably be wrong; the civil rights cause has gotten much
bigger than the campus.

If my hypothetical observer were to look again
he would see a large white sign, held high for all to
see, reading in large red letters: A STUDENT VOICE.
For the student in the higher education scene today
is concerned with another kind of rights: Student
Rights. The uprising at Berkeley has been over for
almost two years now and its ideology is being heard
even in the backwaters of higher education; the rip-
ples from the pebble lap the edges everywhere.

* s s

1 AM NOT SURE the above chaacterization of stu-
dents is applicable to Davidson College, but the ideas
of the movement have certainly reached this outpost:
the president of the student body has avowed his in-
terest in academic reform and says that he will at-
tempt to form a committee for course evaluation; J
see that, even as I write this column, Lingle Manor
has invited Professor Abernethy to their quarters to
speak to them. on ‘What should be the role of stu-
dents in helping to determine the policies of David-
son College?”; more importantly, there is hope that
the Curriculum Committee will soon meet to begin
discussions on the revision of the curriculum.

it would be incorrect, however, to portray the
current interest at Davidson in student responsibility
as being concerned with Student Rights. There is no
militant or brooding movement afoot to free the stu-
dents; perhaps there should be, but unfortunately or
fortunately, that is not how things are done here.
More correctly, the present concern should be char-
acterized as a hopefully continuing dialogue and dis-
cussion on the role of students in the determination
of certain aspects of college policy. Even more basi-
cally, this discussion involves an examination of the
relations between studen d their professors: An
extension of the rights 4nd duties of self-discipline
within a new framework of student self-government
is the focal point of this examination..

s * *

BUT THIS INTEREST is not particularly wide-
spread in the student body nor, some say, among the
faculty. I do not intend to wave that thread-bfre
piece of Davidsoniana—student apathy—before our
grazing, emasculated bull, known as Davidson Tra-
dition” in this particular column, but I do hope that
some comments will stir more students and faculty
to consider what Toles they want to play, respective-
ly, in the determination of college policies and what
roles they want each other to fulfill. Just as impor-
tantly, I would hope that more discussion of these
matters Poi then take place and that at least we

all be more informed a ?
een S$ to each others

particular I am in favor of voting student rep-
resentation on the following committees ‘Admissions,
Curriculum, Budget, Artist Series and Public Lec-
tures, Audio-Visual, Buildings and Grounds, College
Union, Debating and Dramatics, Fine Arts, Foreign
Study, Fraternities, Club and Social Life, Reynolds
Lectureship, Academic Scheduling, Non-academic
Scheduling, Scholarships and Loans and Student Pub-
lications. ;

The idea of students on the committees listed
above is certainly nothing new, but the possibility of
their being there is perhaps more imminent now than
ever before. I plan to expand my comments on this
possibility in future columns.
