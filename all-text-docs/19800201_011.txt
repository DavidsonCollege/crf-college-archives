Job market good despite economy

(CPS) Despite economists’
fear of a deep and long-lasting
recession, the 1980 college grad-
uate stands a one to two per-
cent better chance of landing a
job than 1979 grads, according
‘to a new Michigan State Uni-
versity survey of large em-
ployers. Students with bache-
lors degrees are going to be
more actively recruited than
those with masters and doctoral
degrees, the survey also found.

‘We hear a lot of talk about a
recession,’’ comments MSU
Placement Director John Shin-
gleton, “but college grads are in
good shape for two reasons.
First, grads are being hired by
companies for the long run.
We're not talking about posi-
tions that will go up and down.
Second, if there are going to be
cutbacks (in personnel during
an economic slowdown), they're
going to be in the blue collar
ranks.”’

Shingleton’s study was a
survey of 471 employers across
the country.

The results convinced him
that the heaviest recruiting will
be in accounting, aerospace,
electronics, retailing, the mili-
tary, and by the petroleum
industry.

Most employers, though,
said they were more interested
in recruiting students with
bachelors degrees than those
with associate, masters or doc-
toral degrees.

Shingleton also discovered
beginning salaries will be- up
seven-to-eight percent over last
year. Thirty-four percent of the
employers surveyed said start-
ing salaries they offer are
negotiated during the hiring
process, while the remaining
two-thirds of the employers set
salary levels before applicants
walk through the door.

Women’s Sports

ably do well in a sport which is
relatively new to the South and
which emphasizes mental skill
and teamwork.

Developing the women’s ath-
letic program is particularly
important in view of Title IX of
the Education Amendments of
1972 which guarantees equal
opportunities for women in
higher education, said Asso-
ciate Dean of Students Sue
Ross, Title IX coordinator for
Davidson.

According to The Chronicle of
Higher Education, a recent
HEW policy for implementing
Title IX “requires colleges to
award scholarships to men and
women in proportion to their
representation in the athletic

Since Davidson awards
basketball scholarships to men,
Ross said, there would also
have to be scholarships for
women athletes if the new HEW
policy is strictly enforced. But
most women do not want an
athletic scholarship program.

“Personally, I would rather
see the school work on provid-
ing a diversity of experiences
for women rather than channel-
ing all their money into a few
scholarships,’’ Iles said.

However, if Davidson does
not establish a ‘‘long range
plan’’ for women’s athletics,
Ross said the HEW policies
may be enforced.

that Davidson ‘‘voluntarily
attempt to reach (the College's
own) goals. In the spirit of the
Honor Code we have a respone-
ibility to meet these goals.”
Ross said she thought the
best way to develop the
women’s athletic program was
through student initiative,
citing the recent formation of a

for about 175 juniors and so-
phomores should live off-cam-
pus next year. “If there are that
many we should have no prob-
lems with on-campus over-
»” he said.

There will be more upper-
classmen triples in some of the
larger basement rooms in dorms
and in Carnegia House, Bolding

said. He added that annual

increases in housing fees will
make economical triples more
attractive to students.
. Bolding said all dormitory
lounges, except for those in
Duke, will be open next year.

Freshmen men will live in
Belk again next year, while
freshman women will remain in
Richardson. All other dorms, as
well as basement Sentelle and
fourth floor Belk, will house
upperclassmen.

Bolding said he plans to
replace the Houe Manager in
upperclass dorms with resident

Two resident advisors will
live in each dorm to help
coordinate social activities,
oversee dorm maintenance, and
provide counseling if needed.
They will be selected compet-
ively, Bolding said.

examples; there are many. more.

It does not take a wealth of experience
in computer science to operate programs
like this. But it does take a computer
more powerful than what we have now
and a group of enthusiastic people
involved in it.

But failure to realize the pracital value
of a computer is not the only problem
with our attitude. Another problem is
that some of us are still intimidated by
computers. This is an unjustified fear,
and we need to realize that computers
are not going to depersonalize Davidson.
Computer science is growing faster thatn
any other area of modern development,
and if we are to keep up with what is
going on in the real world each of us
must overcome our prejudices against
technology and learn to use it to our
advantage. Practice with computers
should therefore be an intregal part of a
good liberal arts education.

Every day that goes by here without a
decent computer causes each one of us to
miss out on an exiting and valuable part
of our education. And it will not be long
before familiarity with a computer will
be necessary for all of us; it already is for
many. The computer planning commit-
tee needs to make a decision soon. There

_are many things to consider, however,

and the decision will not be an easy one.
Each of us can take immediate action

_ ‘towards ‘speeding this decision by sup-

porting the members of the committee
and expressing our ‘concern. that some-—
thing be done in the near future. Hope-
fully through a .change in attitude
towards computing and a desire to learn
about this magnigficent tool, Davidson
can begin to offer experience in what is -
undoubtably the most valuable develop-
ment of our age.
