Annual Fees...

Honorary iraternities on the campus were
iaced Tuesday morning with Quips and
Cranks invoiees demanding. for one page in
ahe annual, approximately the same tec
charged tor two pages last year.

The annual stati stated that the purpose
of this was for the betterment of the year-
book, in order that it might be om a par
with other annunis in the state.

No honorary was consulted as to its finan-
cial status, no notice was given of increased
prices, no contracts were presented, but the
invoices arrived without warning demand-
ing the exorbitant sum payable February 15.

Is this gocel business? “When a firm or
an individual pays a bill, he pays for some-
thing for which he has contracted. The an-
nual shonid certainly be fondmeted on a
business like basis.

We venture to say that no honorary on
the campus can stand this fee without
assessments, wich are certainly wot avail:
able. The average honorary fraternity
treasury never contaius as much as the annuat
demands.

It is not- worth it to the average man in
an honorary iraternity to have io go to this
additional expense. What assurance do the

t
i

honoraries have that the other seetions are |

not being improved at their expense? Aiter
all, not a great deal can be done to improve
the honorary section of the book.

Nor are the honorary iraternities the onty
organization hit. As far as can be aseer-
tained fees have been raised all over the

leet these fees when it dictatorially sets
rates without consulting those who must

bear the brunt of the burden?

A Miracle Has Been Worked

(The Davidson student body might well
protit by the example set by N.C. State
College as exhibited in the foltowing editor-
ial from the Pechnician, N.C. State weekly
newspaper).

A miracle has been worked. At the Duke-
State basketball game Tuesday night the
State College students showed a critieal
press that they were not only a bunch of
gentiemen, but that they knew how co act like
gentlemen.

And was the change in spirit noticed? The
students had inot even Jeft the erewded gym-
nasium before the radio lanes. were buzzing
with the news that State College students had
exhibited themseives in a manner exceedingly
commendable of any student body, and that
other North Carolina schools might well profit
if they would follow our example.

“We have never seen a finer spirit of sports-
manship than was shown by the State College
student body to their visitors from Duke:” said
J. B. lark, of radio station WPTEF, in a post-
game summary.

But there is still a certain type of student at
this school that we must climinate, because that
type is composed of boys who grossly misrepre-
sent the College and the Student Body by their

ry

ungentlemanly actions., Many people have said
that eliminating such a student would be a diff-
icule task. Due if we will show bim the kind of

. treatment he deserves when his actions are re-

preachable. vou will soon have a better student
er one who is ready to pack his trunk and go
home where he can associate with people of his
own cast.

Awav With ‘Hell Week’...

College life ts gradually becoming more and
wiore civilised, and lite ac Davidson is no ex-
ception, ‘When several of the national frater-
nities here voted to do as their grand chapters
wished and banished “[leil Week" forever, a
lengthy stride in fraternity progress was made.

However. the move has not vet been unani-
mous on the campus. And college life will
never cease to be somewhat of a caricature in
_the eves of outsiders unul “Hell Week” has
disappeared forever:

Granted that freshmen need discipline, and
that a certain amount should be judiciously ad-
ministered.

The only good that the upperclassman
can derive from seeing the embarrassment
of the pledge is a sadist pleasure. Very
seldom has the system ever proved to have
any disciplinary values.

The antics of a fraternity’s freshmen hurt
-the reputation of the group in the eyes of others
in many cases. The fraternity aids materially
in lowering the treshman’s standard of work,
hy giving him a poor start in the second semes-
ter, when what he reaily needs is help.

What could be more thoughtless than the
iraternity;s requirement that the freshman must
scarry around with him at all times a varied as-
sortment of mints, chewing gum, and cigarettes.
The tinancial responsibilities of a fraternity are
enough without imposing foolish, selfish ways
tor the pledge to waste his money. ;

All we ask you.to do is to be civilized about
this and aid in abolishing foréver this system.
If you must put the treshmen through some or-
deal, do as has been cecommended by many
grand chapters, establish a “work week,” and
get the tresanven to do those littie things around
the house and the boarding house that somehow
rever get done.

The motion is before the floor: “Away with
‘Ilell, Week’. AL in favor?

Senior Slants

“Cause and Effect”

Having arrived at the estate of a so-called
“digniiied. Senior” and being brought face to
contribute a bit

face with the opportunity to
io the newspaper that
one has been been toa
prone to crnitucize, vou'd
be rather surprised at
how undignitied you fecl
and how like a Fresh-
mans theme thoughts
your ideas are. How-
ever, one or two ideas.
have been dwelling with
the writer \aiely and’ in
his Fourth Year Fresh-
man way hed like to pass them on.

Several vears hack. in a column similar to
this, a writer analyzed the currently criticized
Dayidson spirit. ft struck me very forecfulty

.| and from it my mind has seemed to account tor

this nebulous yet real force in wo things —the

personne! of the student body and cenain in-,

stitutions we have here at college.
As regards personnel, Davidson can be justly

proud of its men. for no matter how great a’

ege.is if it hasn't the raw materials to work
with it cannot turn out Superior products. Along
this ine. 1 wonder if maybe a more careiul se-
lection of incoming men might not make the
name of the coliege even greater. Some selec-
tivity is exercised now, but certainly the “mor-
talite rate” should not be as high as at the end
of this semester. Wouid not a system of en-
trance exams, college boards or the like,
coupled together with personal interviews make
our student body even finer? A committee
on admissions could handle such a problem,
and eliminate many of the “sudden deaths’
throngh more careful selection according to
‘ability rather than by priority of application.

Having made such a sclection. tradition alone
cannot mold the men in the Davidson way. True
it can do a lot, but there in one influence in par-
ticular that has done and is doing more towards
fostering this spirit than anything else — the
chapel and ghurch hours. Doubtless all of us
rebel at the compulsion of these at one time or
another, yet they are the integrating force of
Davidson College.

In them we find a bond of union and of ideal-
ism, which is too often neglected in our modern
-education. It is the one time each day when
we meet together as a unit. Think of college
without them, and possibly you can better real-
ize what they are to us. We would not leave
that feeling of oneness, we would not have that
common ground of inspiration <.nd aspiration,
we would not leave Davidson. ;

EVELYN HOWELL,
LET THE
FROSH VOTE, ..
Dear Editor:

“We hold these traths to be seli-j
evident .....-government . deriv.
ing their power from the consent
of the governed . "go read ex-
cerpts from the divinely inspired
Declaration of Independence.

To Davidson men believing ing
these. fundamental truths of democ- |
racy this should have.a pregnant
significance, for under our student
hody constitution the freshman
class is governed without its con-
sent. To be specatie. the freshman
class is denied whe right to vote
for the oificers, with one pexcep-
tion, that will govern them during
their SOPHOMORE year. What
greater hypocritical insult could-be
hurled at the form of governifent
in which we profess to believe?

The basis upon which this right,
a mght that had existed for a cen-
tury, was denied was that freshmen
are not qualified to vote. Besides
being an insult to democracy this
is an insult to reason, for by a sim-
ple analytical test it can be proved
that the qualifications of ™fresh-
man as a voter far out-rank those
of a senior. Have we forgotten how
to think? It certainly seems so, for
by taking a representative group
irom both freshman and senior
class in-the_month of March it is
universally admitted that the .first
year class knows by far the great-!

SD

er number of men ih the lower
three classes. .

Who votes on the basis of friend-
ship and who on an_ idealistic
weighing of the qualifications of
the candidates? Can the junior or
senior be blamed for voting for his
personal friend? Not if he is cap-
able of a genuine friendship, while
the freshinan has only a very lim.
ited opportunity, if allowed to vote.
to cast his ballot for a personal
friend, because the rute is that the
majority of his close friends are in
his own class by reason of common
problems and environment. .

Again the average senior’s inter-
est-in the future certainly does not
connect itself with that of his alma
mater, while the freshman with
three years of college ‘life before
him is again by reason more in-
terested in his school. If you were
to put this in the form of a ques-
tion and receiwe.an honest answer,
the average senior would confirm
this view.

However, taking precedence over
all the above points is the glaring
truth that if a man in seven months
can't learn enough to cast an in-
telligent vote then there is little
hope of him doing so in four years
and on top of that he is too dull
to be in college. From what fruit
does this giant eat that in
short months he grows so tall?

Well, you will say, in 1936 it was
proposed to let the freshman vote
but this proposal was defeated.
Why: Simply because the typical
Davidson man says, “I was not al-
lowed to vote as a freshman, why
should L.allow others to enjoy a
right that I was denied?” This is an
actual quotation and significantly,
an additional proof that the seniors
who argue so are not the well-qual-
ified voters they profess to be.

The reader will ask, “Why eet
so heated up over a question that
has been more or less dormant for
four years?” The answer being that
it is essential to the well-being of
our college in order to preserve our
famous “Wildcat spirit” from the

From Campus to Campus

Two scientists at the University
of Nebraska medical college have
announced discovery of a new local
anesthetic, “more pleasant and saf-
cr than many administered today.”

The drug has a handy little label
— B — diethylaminoethyl 4 ethoxy
benzoate—and for four years has
been the subject of research and
experimentation on the part of Dr.
A. R. Melntyre, chairman of the
department of physiology and
pharmacology, and R. F. Sievers,
an advanced student working under
a fellowship.

Scientists say the new product
deadens pain immediately after in-

}jeetion, whereas other drugs often

For boys to hiteh hike from out of

you enter and is really worth stop-
ping to look at some day. It has
an arrangement for every day in

anything that could be imagined. It
Jis even so good that if the current
is turned off for any time less than
an hour it will make up the lost
time by itself with no outside inter-
ference. Have you ever seen that
old bench in front of the so-called
new gym? It is an old wooden
bench built between two trees and
has been there as long as most can
remember. Or have you ever scen
that old sign over the front porch
of the old gym? It is an old sign
where the R. 0. T. C Department
used to be. Have you ever seen
the time when you weren't behind
in your school work?
