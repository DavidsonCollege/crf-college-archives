Win Over Virginia Tech
Called The Greatest Ever

By AUBREY LANCASTER

THEY SAID it couldn’t be done. We did, too. Here
Was an opponent who had been rated the strongest team
in the Southern Conference by almost everyone—includ-
ing Coach Bill Dole. The Techmen had rolled over Vir-
ginia, Richmond, Wake Forest, West Virginia and Wil-
liam and Mary. They had lost narrowly to powerhouses
Clemson and North Carolina State.

DAVIDSON, on the other hand, was one and four on
the season.

VPI’s publicity releases that week mentioned David-
son only parenthetically, looking forward to the George
Washington game today. The Davidson game was to be
a piling on of statistics for Tech, nothing more. The
school newspaper predicted a 49-0 score, making such
remarks as, “There’s been a nasty rumor floating around.
It’s not true. Davidson WILL show up for the game.”

IT STARTED raining on Saturday. Miles Stadium, |

built into an earth-well, was the picture of gloom, flanked
by the castle-type wails of campus buildings.

|
BECAUSE they expected a slim turn-out for the game, |
the Gobblers had arranged for neighboring high school |
students to get in for 50 cents a head, A resounding |
chorus of “boos” greeted the Wildcats onto the field.
MEANWHILE, your sports editor was groping his |
way through the mountains of Virginia, having misjudged
the driving time to Blacksburg. At 2:05 p.m., 35 minutes
late, he arrived in a drizzling rain. A grating roar went
up from the crowd as he stepped from the car. He could
imagine what was registered on the scoreboard.

PASSING through the gate, he saw the score: 7-0.
Not until he reached the press box (the one dry place in
the stadium) did he realize that the touchdown was Davy-
idson’s. The high schoolers had appointed themselves
our cheering section. Any visions of a lucky Wildcat
break were shattered when the halftime stats came out
and credited the Gobblers with only two first downs.

A COUPLE of the VPI spotters left “to light a fire
under the Gobblers.’’ Did they succeed? “Yeh,” said
someone sarcastically as the third period wore on.

DAVIDSON added two points with a safety and as
early as 10:50 remaining in the fourth period, most Gob-
bler rooters were willing to concede.

EVEN WHEN VPI pushed across a late touchdown,
you had the feeling that Davidson still commanded the

Last Saturday night at 10:30, about two-hundred jubi-
lant Davidsonians jammed the Ballroom of the College
Union, as first President Martin and then Coach Dole
stood in front of the Wildcat football team and pro-
claimed “the greatest victory ever for a Davidson foot-

ball team.”

Just five hours earlier, Coach
Dole had been carried to the
center of the field by these
same Wildcat warriors who had
scored a momentous 9-7 victory
over powerful V.P.I. before 4000
onlookers who were too stunned
by developments to feel either
wet or chilled in rainy Blacks-
burg.

Says Coach Dole, “I thought
if we could hold them defen-
sively . .. if we could keep
moving our defenses around...
we'd have a chance.” Davidson
did

TOOK COMMAND

The first half saw Davidson
completely dominate the field
as the Wildeat defenses held
the Gobblers to 48 yards net,
while the Davidson offense was
moving the ball for a phenom-
enal 191 yards.

Davidson scored its touch-
down with 6:28 remaining in
the second quarter on a nine-
yard pass from Tee Redding to
Danny House. Bruce Usher ad-
ded the extra point.

This score climaxed a 76-yard
scoring drive, with the Wild-
cats covering the ground in 13
plays.

V.P.I.’s Gobblers returned to
the field for the second half
an aroused ball team, but the
strong ‘Cat defenses coupled
with their own offensive inept-
ness proved too much for the

With 5.09 remaining in the

scored on the tiring ‘Cat de-

the score with Art Pruett go-
ing the last three.

Davidson had just held the

seven-yard-line,

game. A 71-yard touchdown run by the Gobblers was
called back because of a holding penalty. You were not
suddenly shocked, then relieved, for the touchdown was
not meant to be.

SOMEHOW, those who ‘had watched the Wildcats
week in and week out forgot about the other weeks.
There was admiration for a well-played game between
two good teams.

THE BOMB of amazement did not explode until the
Wildcats lifted Coach Dole and cased thn across the
field. Davidson had played its greatest game—ever.

The Players Tell

Our ‘highest praise goes to

who was named Tuesday as the
Southern Conference Player of
the Week, but we could not
help but mention the whole
team for its superlative effort
at Virginia Tech.

For a change we'll let the
players do their own talking.
Here's how they saw the V.P.1.

DUNCAN MORTON: Beat Le-

KENT TUCKER: The best
feeling I've ever had after a
ballgame. That guy Zeno is
nothing short of terrific.

tory, on to Lehigh.

TOM SIMPSON: It feels won-
derful to win again.

JERRY SHEFFIELD: It was
a real pleasure, old stout.

The loss to V.M.I. came last
weekend, and it is certain that
Lehigh would like to get even
with the Southern Conference,
and in addition keep up its
winning ways against Davidson.

came south for their first en-
counter with the ‘Cats, and
managed to do something no
other foe could—they shut the

Once again, the Wildcats face
a bigger and stronger team. As-
sistant Coach Tom Stevens, who
scouted the Engineers’ 18-14
loss to V.M.L, described them
as “a real tough team, with a
big line averaging a little over
200 pounds.”

Stevens added, “V.M.I. got
three quick touchdowns in the
first half, but couldn't move
the ball in the second half.”

He went on to point out that
“Lehigh has a lot of power, and
uses a great many roll-out pas-

Wolfpack has a lot of potential
but hasn't won any games as
of yet.

When asked what he thought
about the game, Coach Marrotte
explained, “This is a key game.
A win at Raleigh could make
the season a real success.”

Last week the Wildcats lost
to a hard playing Norfolk Navy
team 1-0.

The Navy boys played a good
progressive game, and in the
fourth period, they got a good
break, when Davidson was pen-
alized.
