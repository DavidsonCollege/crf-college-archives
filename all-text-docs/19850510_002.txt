Student Recognized For Outstanding Contrib-
utions

Davidson students are active in many areas of community service and con-

cern. Most people are active within a college organization, and outstanding con-
tribution to those organizations are recognized by the College community. Re-
cently a Davidson student was recognized for her contributions outside of the
college campus.

Senior Nancy Rosselot has been named “Brownie Troop Leader of the Year”
by the Hornet’s Nest Council of the Girl Scouts of America. The council covers
an eight-county area. Nancy started working with the Davidson Brownie Troop
her sophomore year. Her troop provides much of the campus with Girl Scout
cookies each year, and their float won first place in the Davidson Town Day
parade this year.

Judy Redd strengthened the Girl Scouting program in Davidson this year by
starting a Junior troop for girls who are older than the Brownies. Both women
were recognized for the impact they have made on the scouting program for girls
in the Davidson community.
