The final word

A cursory glance at the Observer informs the foreigner what the
Charlotte native has known for some time: the Queen City is on the move.
The promising young star of the American South, Charlotte searches for an
identity to distinguish itself from cities with whom it no longer competes,
while Charlotteans forge an image to bump their town into the ranks of the
nation’s urban elite.

Similarly, only in the last decade has Davidson been recognized among
the best of America’s liberal arts colleges. And just as the school strives to
shed provincial images with which any Southern institution can be stereo-
typed—of sexist, racist, and reactionist tendencies—its students spend four
years forming the beliefs and molding the ideals by which they want to live.

Though The Davidsonian has been criticized for uneven news reporting,
scant sports coverage, and crude opinions pieces, Chris and I have been
driven by the belief that the paper should reflect, more than anything else,
the changing character of the schooi and its students. And it is in the
Opinions section that one sometimes finds a student ardently striving,
wrestling even, to create informed and moral beliefs. In these pieces, one
finds what Davidson was meant to be, a place where genuine intellectual
curiosity thrives.

Through intellectual pursuits at places like Davidson, “tolerance” and
“open-mindedness” have replaced “segregation” and “division” as the new
Southern by-words. In some sense, however, an open-minded attitude,
taken to its extreme, might result in a complacent tendency to accept bad
ideas as simply “different.” Open-mindedness should not imply blind
acceptance, but a desire to listen to differing opinions, an ability to view
these opinions without bias, and a willingness to discard poorly conceived
ideas.

As Leigh Rawdon, Alex Crumbley, and Mandy Curtis take over the
paper, I challenge the Davidson community to accept from them nothing less
than excellence. Even where Volume 85 has failed, these three students
possess the ability and the desire to take The Davidsonian beyond its former
limits. This paper can become what the editors want to create, and what our
readers deserve to have. And so, read, not blindly accepting, but actively
challenging, what they express. Chris and I have every confidence in their
ability to excel.

Thanks.

LETTERS

Crying "racism" not the answer.

'To the editors,

In last week’s issue of
The Davidsonian, Love of
Learning Assistant Joan
Miller recounted a disheart-
ening encounter with two of
the employees at Dover’s
grocery store.

While Isympathize with
her forbeing overlookedand
therefore frustrated (a com-
mon experience in large
Stores), I found her assertion
of “racism” to be an overre-
action. Having worked in a
grocery store myself, I can
quickly recognize the disin-
terest as apathy or fatigue,
not hatred.

Imagine how you would

feel getting up at 6:00 a.m.,
working an eight hour shift
at minimum wage, having
no lunch, feeling pressured
by your boss, and on top of
all this, being accused of rac-
ism by analienated customer
with an attitude.

Perhaps the two work-
ers were not even aware that
you were ready to order;
perhaps if you had asked re-

spectfully for some service
they would have gladly ren-
dered it.

As for the manager who
refused to create a scene for
your benefit, this was the
only professional choice he
orshe could have made. One
impresses neither fellow
workers nor customers by
ranting and raving at an em-
ployee who made a mistake.

Here’s something to
keep in mind: last spring
while living in a different
city, I ventured into a local

_grocer’s to pick up some

cereal and milk. The cashier
who waited on me greeted
me with a frown, picked her
nails before waiting on me,
and showed no sign of vigor

or excitement over being ..

able to serve me.

My annoyance at being
overlooked and the subse-
quent feeling of self-pity
were quickly squelched as
the clerk turned to bag my
groceries, On her right
cheek, neck, and arm were
numerous black-and-blue

spots. No wonder she was
grimacing. If had to work
eight hours ina grocery store
only to go home to someone
who beat me up, I wouldn’t
be very chipper, either.

Please remember, Ms.
Miller, that when people are
rude to you, it probably isn’t
a malicious gesture meant to
offend you. They are prob-
ably just having a worse day
than you are. Life is tough
for everyone, not merely
African-Americans. I am
truly sorry that you had this
experience. Please feel as-
sured that the manager of
Dover’s did take care of the
problem.

Remember, Dover’s
provides a tremendous ser-
wice.to, those students.who
don’t own automobiles or
can’tafford to eat at the Com-
mons or in a house. We
should seek to foster good
relations with these people,
not alienate them and de-
stroy their business.

Sincerely,

Elizabeth Whitehead '94

Lewis clarifies plagiarism rules

To the editors,

Thanks to Mandy Cur-
tis and to the Davidsonian
for sifting through the com-
plexities of the recent debate
over plagiarism.

Please let me make one
slight clarification. Curtis
writes: “According to Lewis,
there is now more room for
judgment; professors can
now decide whether the stu-

dent plagiarized.”

In actuality, professors
cannot decide if a student
plagiarized insofar as pla-
giarism may constitute an
honor violation. Honor vio-
lations belong in the terri-
tory of the Honor Council.

The new statement on
plagiarism simply allows
professors more latitude in
distinguishing between what

Professor Holland calls an
“honest mistake”—a_tech-
nical error—and an act of
dishonor.

Wherever dishonor is
suspected by a faculty mem-
ber, the case should still be
taken to the Dean of Stu-
dents.

Sincerely,

Cynthia Lewis

Professor of English

Don't forget Davidson's origin

'To the editors,

An analogy concerning
the Board of Trustees:
Suppose there is a
church. It’s a small, pious,
solidly-founded church
whose minister, deacons and
congregation are there seek-
ing fellowship with others,
inspiration and a deeper
knowledge of Christianity.
‘Now, this church has a
choir— a really good choir.
For a while it’s a well-kept
secret, but pretty soon word
Starts to spread. Music
lovers and musicians alike
become curious about this
awesome choir and come to
listen and share their own
talents!’ Ofcourse, not all of.

nificent choir,

them are Christians, but the
church does not turn one
single person away, because .
its purpose is to open its
doors to everyone and share
the gifts God has blessed
them with— musical and
otherwise.

Everything runs
smoothly. The choir, be-
cause of its diversity and
range of voices, and because
of ideas contributed by the
members has become a mag-
known
throughout the land.

And then one day, one
of the non-Christian musi-
cians decides he would like
to become a deacon so he

‘would-be in a bettér position

to advise the choir. Why
not, after all? The majority
of the congregation these
days is not really Christian,
anyway. They just come for
the music, and don’t bother
with the other aspects of the
church.

A tremendous debate
ensues. The non-Christians
are all for it, because they
only see the church in terms
of music. But the Christians
know that it goes much
deeper than that. It would be
a compromise of everything
the Church itself stands for.
It would change the whole
structure of the church. It
