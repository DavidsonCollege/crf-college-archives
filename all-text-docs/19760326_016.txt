Winkler speaks his heart and mind

By Professor of English
CHARLES E. LLOYD

In these forty-odd poems a man
speaks his heart and mind in his own
authentic voice, to his own mésie, and
to our lasting joy and benefit.
Winkler is by no means optimistic;
not ‘what the Germans all
lebensbejahend (‘‘saying ‘yes’ to
life’), he tends rather to say ‘‘Yes,
but--”’, or “‘Sometimes yes.” In fact,
the only ‘‘yes’’ in the collection,
followed immediately with ‘‘by
damn’’, comes from a dumb cousin;
and the “no’s’’ and ‘“‘nope’s’’, both
written and implied, are thick. Wink-
ler knows how -- and what -- to hate.

And still the effect on us as we read
is tonic and joyous. Personally, I
have not experienced any utterance
that gave me so much hope for this
country since Adlai Stevenson’s
acceptance speech at Chicago in 1952.
If Stevenson could have read these

%,

poems! If Grant had been drinking at

Appomattox! Only a man of learning
could have written what Winkler has;
but he savors the vigor of rural speech
as well as the glory of scholarship.
The poems bring us close to trout-
streams, coves, bad girls and good
ones, logging railroads, beach resorts,
country jails, family, friends, motels,
popskull drinkers, hound dogs, young
sex, and great. good jokes; and
nowhere can we say “Winkler picked
this up from So-and -so.”’

He loves the best poets in the
world, and derives his tone from
nobody. He loves the Southern high-
lands and their people; yet he never
appears as ‘‘the mountainy singer,”
never puts on ethnicity. What he does
is to speak in the great highland
tradition, whose excellence it is never
to say more than is meant. The result
is that wherever we read these poems

becomes for the time the Free State of
Franklin; and sometimes Quebec or
Bamberg or Bonn. For Winkler is no
provincial. I would wrong these
poems to call them, as they are, the
best I have read by a living North
Carolinian; I have no hesitation in
ranking him with Randall Jarrell and
Theodore Roethke.

His rhythms are shifting, subtle,
surprising, and always euphonious.
He uses few rhymes, almost all of
them playful. The result is somewhere
between plainsong although
Winkler would deny it bitterly -- and
sung speech; it is the work of a skilled
metrist and musician. But it is behind
the words that we sense the music in
his mind; the fun of Homer and
Jethro, of Hoffnung, and of Mozart,
and the profundity of Beethoven.

The book is physically beautiful. A
former Davidsonian, Dr. Moreland

a SS SOS MASSON SY

Hogan of Chapel Hill, scholar, poet
and bookman, is responsible. In his
Photocomposition Service he has the
only complete set of‘ Monophoto
typefonts in the western hemisphere,

Winkler’s great triumph is to have
written with deep feeling and still to
have laughed at himself; to speak love
without sentimentality; to rage with-
out malice; to innovate in language
without sounding precious; to tell
suffering without self-pity; to worship
without religiosity; and to be himself
without self-advertisement. May he
live long to bless us -- and cuss us.

Lest any think I have allowed
personal friendship to sway my
critical judgement, let me state: (1) I
may yet sue Mr. Winkler for the
aspersions he has cast, these fifteen
years, on my singing; and (2) if he
doesn’t quit hounding me, I never will
pay him the thirty-seven cents he lent
me in 1963.
