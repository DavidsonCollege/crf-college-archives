UMass Campus Seethes
With Racial Tension ee

(CPS) By John Williams

There has been no lack of con-
troversy at the university of Mas-
sachusetts at Amherst this fall as
racial tensions among students re-
sulted in disturbances in dorms,
the takeover of a building and a
lawsuit filed against the campus
newspaper.

“Tt is fair to say that emotions
are running high,” said university

spokesman Danny Chun. “They
are serious incidents.” :
There were three well-publi-

cized events that have brought na-
tional attention to the school. The
university has an enrollment of
23,600, of which about 9 percent
are minority students. The inci-
dents, to date, are:

-A black residential assistant
was attacked by a white man ina
dormitory, and the incident later
sparked a melee by minority stu-
dents in the building.

-About 30 students took over
the alumniand development build-
ing for a week, demanding that the
state fund more scholarships for
minority females. They also were
protesting the Columbus Day cel-
ebration held Oct. 12.

-Three minority students sued
the: independent Daily Collegian
on charges of discrimination and
violation of their civil rights.

The incident with resident as-
sistant Arlens Barosy began Sept.
25 when he asked some people
who were drinking in a hallway in
Washington Tower to get rid of the
alcohol. A white male, who isn’ta
student, allegedly punched Barosy
and ran off. Barosy / chased, him
and got punched again.

On Oct. 3, Barosy found ra-
cial graffiti and feces smeared near
his room, and five days later, ten-
sions percolated to the point that
about 35 students rampaged
through the 22-story building, over-

song.

Ellis said that he draws his
stories from a number of cultures,
not just from the Native Ameri-
cans. “There were 246 distinct
cultures before Columbus, all with
different religions, songs, and cus-
toms,” said Brian.

Brian also took time during
his performance to elaborate on
some points about the Native
American in today’s society. He
believes that the “interest in Na-
tive Americans worldwide is more
than a curosity.” People are just
now coming to realize that Native
Americans have some answers to
give to modern-day problems.

Ellis said that some Native
Americans now believe that the
white man has a new “spiritual
maifest destiny.” First the white
man takes over the Native
American’s lands and kills his
families; and with their renewed
interest in his culture, they want to
steal his gods.

turning trash cans and pulling bul-
letin boards off walls.

Two students who had been
associated with the suspect agreed
to move out of the building “for
safety reasons,” Chun said. The
suspect was found and faces
charges of assault and deprivation
of civil rights.

Chancellor Richard O’Brien
promised students Oct. 9 thatcam-
pus security would be increased in
the dorm area. His solutions in-
clude expanding the university’s
escort service and re-instituting
human relations, social and crisis
intervention training for the
school’s public safety personnel.

“This training must be ongo-
ing, not a one-shot event,” he said.
“A review of the department pro-
tocols for incidents of racial ha-
rassment and graffiti is also in or-
der.”

Meanwhile, on Oct. 6, about
30 students occupied Memorial
Hall, the university’s alumni and
development building. They were
protesting the celebration of Co-
lumbus Day, saying they wanted
the state government to have an
annual teach-in to bolster their ar-
gument that Columbus was the start
of 500 years of genocide and sla-
very. Additionally, Chun said, the
students wanted that state to fund
40 scholarships a year for minority
female students.

The. last seven students left
the building Oct. 13 with no inci-
dent after university employees
moved their belongings from the
second floor, where they were
holed up, to the first floor and
eventually out the door.

And finally, the independent
Daily Collegian was sued by three

minority graduate students who
claim they were fired because they
wrote stories that editors didn’t
like.

Dan Wetzel, editor in chief of
the undergraduate paper, denied
he fired Rabi Dutta of India,
Hussein Ibish of Lebanon and
Madamohan Rao of India. All are
doctoral students who put out a
biweekly page in the paper on for-
eign affairs.

Christobal Bonifaz, the trio’s
attorney, said they were fired in
early September, They gave the
university an ultimatum that they
be rehired by Sept. 21 and have
voting power to electa page editor.
He said the university agreed to the
demand, but the paper appointed
an editor for the page and the stu-
dents weren’t asked to return.

Bonifaz sued in Massachusetts
Superior Court on 12 counts, in-
cluding violation of civil rights.
He wants the court to reinstate the
students. “Thisisan outrage. They
fell very proud of the product they
are producing,” he said. “To pull
the rug out from under them is very
damaging. Their reputation is at
stake.”

Weizel said he never fired the
students and said the agreement
would have broken paper policy
on the election of editors, who can
only be voted in at the beginning of
asemester. During a semester, an
editor can be appointed, he said.

“The charges are false. They
asked me to break the rules,” he
said. “They were never fired from
the staffand are still full staff mem-
bers. Here are three guys in their
early 30s suing an undergraduate
newspaper with people in their 20s.
I hope they move on, if they can.”

Cornwell

Continued from page 1
Comwell’s time was spent in Richmond’s medical examiner’s office
where she observed the forensic pathology now characteristic of her
novels.

Post Mortem began Cornwell’s series of Kay Scarpetta novels,
receiving five international awards in the process. Body of Evidence and
All That Remains followed accumulating numerous accolades. Her
fourth novel, Cruel and Unusual, has yet to be published but is receiving
much publicity.

Cornwell has been in Hollywood negotiating with the film industry
about a possible screenplay adaptation of Cruel and Unusual. She could
not reveal the specifics to her Davidson audience, however, because she
awaits a public announcement from Hollywood.

The example of her success and writing scolarships like hers will
prove, Cornwell concluded, that all graduates do not have to become
physicians or attorneys. There is literary life beyond Davidson.

take Davidson students to the rally and gave them all VIP passes to get
down closer to the platform from which Clinton was speaking. This
group also organized a voter registration drive in the Union, brought
Congressional candidates Mel Watt and Rory Blake tocampus, and went
door-to-door in the town of Davidson urging citizens to vote for
Democratic candidates.

The College Republicans have provided students with paraphenalia
for their candidates. They have also called area Republicans to tell them
to get out and vote on Tuesday.

Both of the groups sponsored a debate last month between students
of each party. Student Republicans and Democrats have also talked at
area Charlotte schools about the beliefs and platforms of their particular

George Scheibner, WDAV’s program director, explained that the
music broadcast during the week was a selection from the station’s core
catalogue. “You could call it ‘the best of the best,” said Scheibner.

WDAV’s first fundraiser was held in the fall of 1979. Since 1981
it has been known as “Celebration”, according to Clark, in order to
emphasize that the week is a celebration of listener support of WDAV.

Said Clark, “It is always impressive to me the response and loyality
of the listeners who, when asked to come through, show their support

time after time.”

Dean Marsicano anticipates that a new chaplain will be installed by
the end of the academic year at the latest.
