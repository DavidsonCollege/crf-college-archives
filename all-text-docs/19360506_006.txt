But each year seemed to bring a
finer group. This fact is just as
true in the case of the present cab-

who had served and urged the new
men to follow in their efootsteps.

Dr. Arbuckle closed his exhor-
tation saying that while serving
“we are not servants, but friends

—" “Henceforth I call you not ser-

vants; for the servant knoweth not
what his lord doeth: but I have
called you friends; for all things

that I have heard of my Father I
have made known unto you.”

After the meeting ‘had been ad-

a buffet dinner, the feature of the
evening.

Dr. Arbuckle has for many years
been chairman of the Y. M. C. A.
Soard of Control. In the words of
“Y" Secretary McClure: “Dr, Ar-

buckle may well be termed the
father of the Y. M. C. A. in this
institution. He has always been

one of the most loyal supporters of
the organization since inception.
Both Mrs. Arbuckle have
taken an active part in years past.”

this book a broad-minded cosmo-
politan surgeon and biologist of
world-famous attainment pours out
the philosophy of a thoughtful life-
time, suggesting the first outlines
of a science of man and giving the
reader in simple language as much
medical knowledge as he needs to
know to comprehend the argu-
ment.”

Three of the new books have to

do with music, namely: “Philip

To the Christian Students of David-
son College:

When a great remedy is to be ap-
plied in a time of great need, the call
is not for mediocrity. It is an oppor-
tunity for men of great talents who
have had great advantages. If any
of you, who enjoy unusual advantages
at Davidson, are endowed with great
capacity, it is not accidental. The
Great Commander is saying to you:
“Look without—at the great need.
Look within—at the great capacity.
These are complementary.”

Use your common sense to interpret
He is calling you to the
front—probably to the first post of
leadership—the Christian ministry.
