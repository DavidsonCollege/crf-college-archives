We Can Support
Both The Environment

And The War

To begin with, I thank Rob
Kelly for his response to my article
of two weeks ago. I am encour-
aged that others consider the issue
of faculty evaluations important

and am impressed that action re-
sulted. As an (amateur) journalist
I wish to connect people with in-
formation rather than simply com-
plaining about isolated problems
and offering idealistic solutions.
So stated, this week I address the
ever-present war. I hope my
thoughts will provokes interest and
initiative.

The war is in its twelfth day.
Time Magazine recently stated, “If
there is such a thing as a just war,
President Bush launched one
against Saddam.” I agree.

Whatever your beliefs about
the war, there are positive steps
you can take with regard to it.

Undeniably, one of the central

smartmove, if you asked me. Even
if this cynical notion has a shred of
credibility, what could I do about
it? Reduce the demand which
created the situation in the first
place. Consider the following
simple things:

To save oil check the air in
your tires and fill them if they are
low. Try to keep your car tuned up
so that the engine runs efficiently.
Organize your errands together so
that you don’t make unnecessary
trips to the Pantry or Cornelius for
example. Carpool when possible.
(To the Pub?)

Write your congress in sup-
port ofa higher gasoline tax (Sorry
George, read my acid rain) and
higher standards for clean air and
water. When you look for a new
car in the future, exercise your
influence as aconsumer by choos-
ing high-mileage cars as opposed
to the turbo family living room
model.

Once you leave Davidson and
enter the work force, in a city per-
haps, use public transit. Ofcourse,
if the recession continues you
might be forced by economic ne-
cessity to pursue this option. But
you can read the paper on the way
to work and encounter many inter-
esting characters. You might also
pack a large-caliber handgun, but
whistle and smile knowing you are
doing the right thing.

In all serious-
ness, “Think globally, act locally,”
is a bumpersticker idea that I do
believe in. It is also politically
inert. Lefty granolas, Yuppies, the
NRA, and Jesse Helms, whether
they like each other or not, share
the same ecosystem and economic

Ott's protest of the war and would not personally

issues of the war is its link with oil.
The issue is far more complicated
than a bumpersticker slogan of “No
Blood for Oil.” Our economy is
dependent upon the oil in the Gulf
to run our transportation systems
among other things. The price-
per-barrel of oil and Dow Jones
Industrial average fluctuate wildly
upon the latest word from the Gulf.
ABC News pointed out that
Hussein can blow up the Kuwati
oil wells. He might attempt to foil
our air force by blackening the
skies or just do it for revenge as he
retreats. Either desperate act would
wreak environmental havoc.

I assert that one of the best
ways for a civilian to behave in
response to the war is to conserve
oil athome and to recycle our natu-
ral resources.

Tadmit that this suggestion does
not defeat the argument that this
war is for oil. Uncle Sam may have
clinched free oil for years by doing
this little favor for Kuwait. Pretty

system. Both sides stand to gain
from properly managing the in-
vestment we humans have in our

‘natural resources. Part of that is

decreasing consumption,

Oil is not the only natural re-
source. Recycle aluminum, plas-
tic, and glass containers. Recycle
newspapers, looseleaf and colored
paper, and notebooks at the end of
the year. Turn off the water when
you brush your teeth. Take shorter
showers, or even skip a day. Turn
off the lights, Plant a.tree,

Bush tells us that this war is
part of the plan to establish a “new
world order.” Our soldiers are
fighting for that ideal and other
ideals such as national sovereignty
and the inhospitability of “naked
aggression” in this world. The

Western and Arab nations, as well
as the credibility of the UN. The

A Swift Kick In The Backside

In recent weeks there has been
much controversy over protests
regarding theadministration’s poli-
cies in the Persian Gulf. We do
live in a society which allows for
freedoms of ‘expression and per-
sons are allowed to express their
feelings. However, to say that one
has the right to do something be-
lies the fact that we live in a society
of both material and philosophical
luxury. Here on the
Davidson Campus it is

years ago, understand that they are
expected to go and to fight where
the leaders of our nation, demo-
cratically chosen by our popula-
tion, feel that the armed forces are
needed in order to protect the U.S.
and its significant interests abroad.

Despite the fact that support-
ing policies, perhaps at the cost of
one’sown health, may conflict with
our strong sense of independence,

tions more time.

Do not waste your creative
energies when the point is already
moot. Let’s unite and genuinely
rally behind those serving in the
Gulf and our leaders so that we can
help bring the conflict to'a quick
resolution. Itis neither a time to be
partisan noris ita time tocomplain-
about what we should or should
not have done. No one is a ‘hawk’
in a time of war.

cated to public service. The
members of the armed forces are
like typical Davidson - students:
bright, articulate and savvy.

In fact, some of the members
of Operation Desert Storm are
Davidson Alumni. But those who
have joined the armed forces have
done so because they are service
oriented and havea strong belief in
the ideals for which our commu-
nity stands.. The basic job of the
soldier is not an easy one. It in-
volves long hours, a high level of
competition and both mental and
physical challenges. Obviously,
the American does not join the
armed forces for financial rewards.

Today’s soldiers, as those of

desert they did sign up to support
our national policies and to protect
the Constitution of the United
States. It is a significant commit-
ment and the day that men and
women no longer find that serving
our nation is worth the personal
risk, we will all be in trouble.

As the battles continue to rage ©

onin the desert we must remember
that those who have volunteered to
serve our public are fighting at this
very moment. Our leaders, of both
parties, have debated and reached
an agreement on Gulf Policy. The
decision whether or not to con-
tinue sanctions was made long ago.

Therefore it is senseless to protest
that we should have given sanc-
