A Little Help from Our Friends

We, the residents of 507 Con-
cord Road, would like to begin this
letter by thanking the Davidson
community, especially the residents
around 507 Concord, for giving us
the opportunity to move in the
middle of the semester just as re-
views and papers are piling up.
Obviously, we area serious disrup-
tion to their quaint little commu-
nity and should not be living close
to any Davidson staff or Davidson
residents. We appreciate the fact
that they brought this to our atten-
tion by, for all practical purposes,
evicting us.

As the students can attest, we
threw several house parties that at
sometimes even overflowed into
the street and the front porches of
our neighbors. Our radios ran as
loud as possible all night, and we
were continually streaking down
Concord Road. We are, without a
doubt, unworthy to live on Con-
cord Road, and we are grateful that
our neighbors pointed this out to
us.

In all seriousness, we are truly
appalled at the behavior and.under-
handedness of some of the Davidson

staff and residents who feel it is in’

their best interest not to have us
here. Yet they refuse to make their

In response to and in support
of Josh Roberts’ article last week,
I am writing to clarify the things
he said and to add a few of my
own. None quite so snappy as his
surprise at the end, but worth-
while nonetheless.

If you were puzzled when you
got to the end of Josh’s article and
realized that every compliment
that preceded the last sentence was
devoted to the women’s basket-
ball team, maybe this will make
things a littleclearer: the women’s
basketball team is indeed a power
to be reckoned with and one that
treats their opponents as they
should be treated.

Everyone on the team has had
.| a dazzling performance in at least
one game this season. Have you
seen any of them? Have you seen
Jen O’Brien find Jamie Brown for
the winning shot? Have you seen
Carolyn Kirsch steal the ball and
drive down the court for a layup?

Or Jen O’Brien? Or Katy?
Have you seen Monica Winter’s
self-sacrificing divetosavea play?
Have you seen the blocks that
frustrate the other teams? How
about the rebounds? If you
haven’t, by God, go to a game.

And then another point. Josh
said it last week. Mike and Dan
and Aaron talk about it on TV —
the pathetic attendance levels have
got to improve.

These games are good. These
girls are good. They deserve your
support. It’s funny that people
who spend a few hours in class

protests or even their identities
known tous--the ones most affected
by their petty grievances and preju-
dice. We realize that in most cases
“prejudice” is a word reserved for
race relations, but in this case it is
truly applicable since we were pre-
judged. Those around us were com-
plaining about our presence even
before we even moved

in. Once we were here,

driving forces behind this housing
issue was the fear of setting a prece-
dent of RLO housing students off
campus in the Davidson commu-
nity. By moving four of us out, they
have actually created more off-cam-
pus housing for students.

One issue that the Davidson
community seemed to ignore was

Davidson community pride them-
selves on the close relationship be-
tween students and residents. This
housing issue displays the hypoc-
risy of the Davidson community.
They reap all the benefits of this
relationship, but obviously from a
safe distance. In addition, Davidson
proclaims a very close relationship
between students
and staff. This must

They had no power to move all eight
students out, therefore they opted to
move four to a new location. This
seems to be rather warped logic as
Students still remain ‘in the house.
As a result, the other four students

Therefore, instead of minimiz-

free can’t seem to find the hour-
and-a-bit of time needed to watch
some or all of one of these games.
What do you do all day?

Here’s one solution that
should be pretty acceptable. Ev-
eryone loves a study break (you'd
be lying if you said you didn’t), so
make one serve a dual purpose.

Jump up and down and cheer
to get your aerobic exercise for
the day. Heck — make it social,
too. Take your friends. Take
anyone you run into on your way
out the door.

And when you get there,
make yourself known. You don’t
have to be a painted-face, insult-
screaming maniac, but make some
noise. The only thing worse than
people not being there is a fan
who just sits there. So cheer —
it’s fun! And it helps the team.

If you feel inclined, go grab
one of those dots and bother the
other team during their free throws
(okay, so that doesn’t have a high
success rate of causing mistakes,
but be impulsive and silly for
once).

Are you getting excited yet?
Treally can’t think of another way
to say it. Find the time. Make the
time. Go.

athletics at Davidson are too of-

the zoning laws requiring no more
than four unrelated persons to oc-
cupy a house at one time. Another
issue brought before the Davidson
Zoning Board by the residents was
the fact that property values of
neighboring houses would decrease
as a result of students living nearby.
However, the property value of 507
Concord has actually increased due
to the renovations RLO has made.
Davidson College and the

(the ones’ we would naturally as-
sume would have the most objec-
tions to our presence) have voiced
no complaints.

Many who read this may note a
lack of criticism towards RLO and
this is not unintentional. True, they
may have “dropped the ball” ini-
tially, but they have also done more
than anyone else to make this situ-
ation bearable for us. They have
received all of the complaints and

were as angry and astonished at the
behavior of the neighbors, commu-
nity and the Zoning Board as we
were. Getting the reprieve from the
zoning ordinances was supposed to
be a formality, but the esteemed
members of this “tight” community
felt otherwise. Needless to say,
RLO has been a big help after the
fact and we thank them for that.
The-current situation surround-
ing Concord 507 is a travesty in the
relations between the college and
the community. We’ ve been asked
to possibly invite some of these
people over to get to know us--why
should we bother? Thi fact that we

‘even make such a statement should

be areflection of the tension created
between the student body and the
community. This can be seen not
only in our discontent expressed in
this letter, but also in other letters
and articles in The Davidsonian.

Wehope that our neighbors are
proud of their childish behavior and
can properly bask in their glory as‘
they watch us, on Saturday, move :
all of ourbelongings out. We would
like to thank them again for forcing
us to move and the demonstrating
that adulthood does not automati-
cally disqualify one from juvenile
tantrums.

The Trouble with Roommates

The trouble with roommates is
that you can’tlive with 'em, and you
can't live without ‘em.

Whatam I talking about? Well,
you know how it goes. Freshman
year you’re paired by a magical
computer with some “compatible”
person with whom you supposedly
have so much in common. Of
course, “supposedly” is the opera-
tive word here, since freshman
roommate pairing is considered a
smashing success if you and your
roommate are still speaking to each
other by the end of the year.

And then comes sophomore
year when you get to hand pick your
roommate with at least some in-
sight as to what they’re like. Sure,
there’s still the initial awkwardness
in getting to know each other's hab-
its, but no big deal. Come junior
year the two of you are inseparable
and perfectly assimilated to living
with each other. Finally you have
some peace.

But no! Senior year brings
with it a whole new complication in
domesticity: the apartments and
two new roommates. Certainly, in
most cases these new roommates
are good friends or at least close
acquaintances, so it shouldn’t be
toomuch trouble, right? WRONG!!
As I know many of you have dis-
covered, life in the apartments car-
ries with it several challenges to
peaceful living. In fact, I’m not
even sure such a thing is possible
down in Martin Court. ,

Take, for instance, the topic of

cleanliness. Now of course every-
one wants to have aclean apartment
(especially me). But the catch is, no
one wants to clean it. We tried a
cleaning rotation the first week and
it worked marvelously... for the first
week. After that things went to hell.

Like with the dishes. It’s
somebody’s day to do them, yet this
person protests, “I haven’t eaten at
the apartment all week.” But you’re
the only one who cooks those beans
that are now fossilized into the pot.
Or better yet, it’s your turn to scrub
the toilet. “No way man, I never use
the bathroom in the apartment.”
Sorry, you never told me you had
immaculate digestion. You think I
jest, but these are scenes from real
life in 304B and every other apart-
ment on campus. _

And then there’s the television.
So what do you all watch? We
watch only three things: Singled
Out, Sportscenter, and the Weather
Channel. Odd? Maybe it seems
that way until you realize how well
informed we are on such important
subjects as blind dates, ACC scores,
and the relative percent humidity in
Vermont. And God help you if
you’d ever suggest changing the
channel. It’s asmorgasbord of con-
flicting tastes, I tell you.

What about the privacy issue?
Where do you draw the line be-
tween personal autonomy and not
teeing off your roommates? For
instance, one of us has no problem
hanging out partially naked in the
common room, But boy does it

offend other roommates’ more deli-
cate sensibilities.

And what about unannounced
entering? Like when somebody’s
girlfriend knows the code and en-
ters the apartment without knock-
ing (and catches you watching
Singled Out), but then knocks on
her boyfriend’s bedroom door. Isn’t
it ironic, don’t ya think? So what
am I getting at? You wonder how
four people can ever live together
without absolutely ripping each
otherto shreads. Actually, as you’ve
figured out, it’s not all that hard (as
evidenced by the dearth of domes-
tic violence on this campus).

‘Sure it takes some getting used
to, and certain habits may never
cease to get under your proverbial
skin. But it’s a valuable lesson in
getting along with others and toler-
ating each others' differences. And
after all, the magic of the whole
thing is the camaraderie that flour-
ishes. The late night rap sessions,
the hearty laughs over a bottle of
Jack, the surprise birthday parties,
and the general revelry that could
never happen without apartments
and roommates and all those an-
noying habits.

Thus I consider it a tradeoff,
and a damn good one at that: best
friends and good times for some
dirty dishes and grungy bathrooms.

Ofcourse, ifthis was my planet,
the floor would be vacuumed three
times a day and there would be no
