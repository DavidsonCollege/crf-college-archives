Fairies apologize to column S victims

reel PeDOUTS

We have seen the error of
our ways! We have burned our
lace underwear, thrown away
our year’s supply of Vaseline,
cancelled our subscription to
Penthouse, and now write only
to the strains of Anita Bryant
rather than the grunts of
Frank Zappa. Our style has
undergone as radical a change
as the inside of the stalls in the
Library basement men’s rest-
rooms after a coat of fresh
paint.

We have truly reformed. It
has been discovered that in
our dingy pasts shine the
vestiges of an assistant scout-
master, a YMCA basketball
coach of eight-year-olds, and a
prison recreation director. In
the last week, each of us has
reverted to his former whole-
some self. Our only regret is
that we must take time off
from our various civic activi-
ties to write this article.

First, we must make several
apologies to the past victims
of our ‘‘perverted humor’’.
Ockham’s* Razors, a team
whose philosophical leanings
indicate that they are the
epitome of the IMAC student-
athlete, have suffered often
under our vicious diatribes.
This week, the Razors have
preserved their unblemished
record in volleyball by de-
feating the Phi Gamma Del-
tas. Best of luck, gentlemen!

Others from whom we pray
forgiveness include that fine
sportsman, Michael Russ, the
clean-living brothers of Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, and Jay Pow-
ell, who we know was a victim
of his environment.

We have been disturbed by
the recent rash of forfeits in all
phases of IMAC play. These
reprehensible forfeits under-
mine the competitive spirit of
IMAC which has made this
institution so_ great.

The poorest example was
set by First Richardson and
the Ragmen, who continued a
double-forfeit in softball last
Sunday. However, one team
which forfeited this week did
have an excuse: the boys of
Cannon I were unable to meet

In volleyball action, the
misunderstood Sig Eps re-

up to their slogan, ‘“‘Humble in
victory, gracious in defeat,”
when they beat Gomer’s Pyle

In another thriller, Spring

games by Small But Slow, but
the losers showed their class
by treating Spring Fever to
milk and cookies after the
game. x “

The closest game of the
week was the confrontation of
powerful Phi Delta Theta #2
and the Wooley Greys. In a
game of utmost quality in
play, the Delts emerged with a
hard-fought 15-12, 14-16,
15-13 victory.

that these fine women will go
on to become efficient house-
wives, good cooks and devoted
mothers.

It has been reported that
empty beer cans were found at
the edges of IMAC fields #2
and #3. We are convinced that
this litter was deposited by
misguided townspeople. It is
our sincere hope that David-
son IMAC participants will
never succumb to the evil of
alcoholic consumption. Our
present community action pro-
ject is the rehabilitation of the
town’s miscreants.

duals need to be cautioned for
their team names. Persons
possessed of a ‘‘demented wit”’
might misconstrue some of
them. Warnings are hereby
issued to: I Felta Thi, Stea-
min’ Seamen, the Masterbat-
ters, the Moby Dicks, the
Banana Bunch and the Clap.
We are also concerned about
new commissioner Rozelle
Brown’s permitting IMAC
softball play on Sunday, as it
interfered with several play-
ers’ observance of the Sab-
bath.

That’s it for this week.
Sleep tight, get plenty of
exercise and think clean
thoughts.
