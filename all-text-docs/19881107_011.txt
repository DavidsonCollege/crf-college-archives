A review of the NCAA top twenty in basketball

By PHIL PRESCOTT

1. Louisville--The Cardinals
offense and defense revolves
around the great play of 6-9 senior
center Pervis Ellison, The emer-
gence of LaBradford Smith, a 6-3
sophomore guard with phenome-
nal athletic skills, would make
Louisville the favorite.

The Cardinals won’t have the
best record or be at the top of the
polls at the end of the season but
should be peaking during the
NCAA Tournament in March.

2. Georgetown--Although
John Thompson lost the Olympic
Medal Game to Russia, once the
college basketball season starts he
should be all smiles. Alonzo
Mourning, 6-9 center and top
freshman in the country whose

specialty is defense; should make
Thompson’s pressing defense
even more effective. Charles
Smith, the 6-0 point guard, is back
for his senior season and one of
the best clutch players in the
country. De

Dwayne Bryant ‘& Mark
Tilmon will alternate at the other
guard position while Milton Bell
is a 6-7 freshman power forward
who should start with Mourning.
Thompson will go deep in his
bench to get fresh guys.

3. Duke should be in the hunt
again for the national champion-
ship. The team is lead by 6-10
senior power forward Danny
Ferry. Robert Brickey (6-5 Jr.)
and John Smith (6-7 Sr.) should
Start at the forwards with Quinn

Snyder (6-3 Sr. point guard) lead-
ing the team. Freshmen guard-
forward Brian Davis 6-6 & Chris-
tian Laéttner 6-10 center will
demand playing time. |

4, UNLV-- This team has a lot
of incoming talent from the junior
colleges. the only question is how
the new players wilt mesh.

Jerry Tarkanian has the talent to
win it all, he’s molded teams into
big: winners many a time in his
career. The team is led by Stacey
Augmon (6-7 soph. guard-for-
ward) who made the Olympic
Team as a defensive whiz.

Keith James, another experi-
enced player, should start at point
or shooting guard. Juniors Moses
Scurry (6-7), David Butler (6-10)
and George Ackles (6-10) should

compete for positions at forward
whilé-6-1 Sophomore Greg An-
thony, a transfer from Portland
should start at guard.

5. UNC--The Tar Heel team is
loaded with talent as usual. King
Rice, (6-0 soph.) would be a good
point guard except he can’t shoot
the ball.

So unless Rice starts making
some shots, Jeff Lebo (6-3 sr.)
will have to play point guard al-
though he is more’ comfortable at
shooting guard and doesn’t have
the speed to lead a fast break.
Kevin Madden (6-5 jr.) and Steve
Bucknall (6-6 sr.) will alternate
between big guard and small for-
ward. ;

All-American 6-9 260-pound
junior power-forward J. R. Reid

will play alongside Scott~Wil-
liams 6-10 jr. center with sopho-
mores Pete Chilcutt 6-8 and Rich
Fox 6-7 alternating at small for-
ward.
6. Ohio State
7. Temple
8. Villanova
9. Iowa
‘10. Georgia
11. Arizona
12. Indiana
13. Notre Dame
14. Connecticut
15. Stanford
16. Wake Forest
17. University of North
Carolina-Charlotte
18. Pittsburgh
19. Syracuse
20. Georgia Tech

even more difficult.

But Gatto does not advocate changing
admissions standards to suit the needs of
the football program. He believes that “we
can’t be.a football program that doesn’t fit

[with the rest of the school].”

Furthermore, the Colonial League poses
problems in terms of geography. Alumni
support and recruiting, Gatto believes, are
affected adversely by Colonial League

membership,

Addressing the financial obligations of
the. new. league, Gatto said, “We haven’t

had a budgetary increase.”

°

Also, recruiting practices of the league
schools are more-in sync with northeastern

rather than southern practices.

“Need-based financial aid is out of step
with southern recruiting,” said Gatto.

Finally, Gatto addressed recruiting, “the —
process of selling the school and the pro-

gram.” 3.

Gatto believes that football recruits _
place education first in coming to .
Davidson and the desire to play football _

second,

In recruiting, Gatto says he possesses a
great tool--the ability to tell a recruit that he
will play and make an impact on the pro--
gram. “Our recruiting has been assisted by

our lack of success.”
He gives several'‘exam

(ame

into starting roles immediately.

Particularly, freshman Horace Hamm,
an outstanding réceiver and kick-returner,-
“decided to come here because he knew he
would play,” rather than going to Lehigh '
‘where he would not have had that immedi-

ate impact.

For the sake of his program, Gatto must .
hope that more players like Horace Hamm
decide to come to Davidson, and soon.
