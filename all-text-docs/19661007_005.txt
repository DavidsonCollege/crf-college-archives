Lefty’s instant replay closed circuit television system | :
got its first test this afternoon at the freshman football
game. The football department thinks it will help the de-
fense more than the offense in studying how a gap was
opened in the line or in studying pass patterns. _

The gadget is extremely portable and surprisingly
uncomplicated. It consists of a camera about the size of
a regular table movie camera, a tape recorder slightly
bigger than a regular version, a small televisior,camera
that can pick up regular channels as well as tne local
circuit and a microphone which will not play a big role
except in possibly taping parts of Homer's television
show.

Harry Fogleman could sit on his laurels after winning

a point where it can get ready in time for another strong
schedule which will include Northwestern for the first
time, plus possibly Ohio State or Dartmout

will resemble a path of thorns instead of,a bed of roses.
The conference will be a lot tougher, especially George
Washington, The Citadel and Furman. -

Foglemen says seven men have made the squad for
the coming season. Esmond Phelps and Pinky Hatcher
are battling for the number one spot. Seniors Peter Par-
rott and Georgie Mueller and juniors-Frank Bass, Dan
Hearon and Dave Jennings are thé others. Vying for the
remaining spots on the squad are sophomores Bruce
Weidner, Al Varner and Judson McKellar.

Freshman coach Frank Spence has named four can-

GETTING READY

Although plagued by Inclement weather, fall baseball prac-
tice has gone through the work of establishing the basics of Coach
Tom Stevens’ system so as not to have to spend the time next
spring. The acquisition of the new field and some promising var-
sity newcomers have provided a big plus factor. Practice con
tinues through next Friday with an intersquad game to conclude
the fall season. Here Stevens hits.a grounder to Joe Rice. (Staff

Stasavich Eyes
Game

Saturday

By BOB REID
Assistant Sports Editor

“We plan on giving Davidson
a pretty good game Saturday.”
East Carolina Head Coach Clar-
ence Stasavich told THE DA-
VIDSONIAN in a telephone in-
terview this week. ‘‘The team
has looked only fair in the last
couple of weeks.”’ he said, “but
Saturday is our Homecoming
and the boys probably want to
play a fierce game. They gener-
ally do at Homecoming.”

Stasavich, NAIA Coach-of-the
Year in 1959 and member of the
Helms Athletic Foundation Hall
of Fame, said the Pirates’ block-
ing has been “not as sharp as
it should be,"" but he feels his
team will be ready: for David-
son. ;

“Thave a lot of respect for Da-
vidson,” Stasavich said. ‘‘They
have some real fine ball players.
Davidson has a fine offense
which is reflected in the fact
they are the number one offense
team in the conference.”

ECC’s offense may provide a
few new wrinkles for the ‘Cats,

from Tarboro has averaged 53.5
yards a carry this season, Stas-
avich said.

‘We'll have the biggest crowd.
of the season here Saturday,"
Stasavich said. Davidson has a
good following. down here, and
there will be a lot of folks here
for Homecoming. This is a con-
ference where the teams are all
pretty even. Anybody can win.
It should be a real fine ball
game.”

CONFERENCE
STANDINGS

since the Pirates are one of the
few major college teams that
still use the single wing. “I like
the single wing,"’ Stasavich said,
“because over a period of 12
years we've averaged 24 or 25
points a game with it. But this
season things haven't been go-
ing quite that well.”
