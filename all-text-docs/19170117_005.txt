Formu has met last Fall you are the

e
THE PART OF THE POPULACE.

It can not be claimed that man-made
institutions are perfect, but it is per-
fectly reasonable that some approach
nore nearly our ideal than others. Of
‘Hl the possible methods of governing a
‘tudent, the form of student self-govern-
nent approaches, perhaps,. more nearly
wir ideal than anv other form. Its
farm is the best because it is the most
lemocratic, and. being Anglo-Saxons
ve must ever cherish a democracy. If
‘t is our choice as a form of government
‘ve must then show our loyalty to it
and. at all times, defend it. .

During the nast two months self-gov-
ernment has fallen into more or less dis-
repute hecause its judicial and executive
hody, the Student Council, has failed
to meet out to offenders of the law the
firm and adequate punishment which
a body, with hisher powers, thought it
should imnose. The writer has as strone
an aversion as anv one to that egotistic
and pessimistic malady of fault-finding :
hence he is slow to offer criticism. And
vet, if he must offer criticism. he has a
strong desire to see it rightly placed.

Perhaps a majority of the student

bhodv—and the writer joins in this num-
,ber—blame the Student Council for its
| failure to act last Fall when it had come
evidence, at least, to know that student
,honor was being violated. It is not
upon this point. that T desire to dwell,
but upon another failure just as im-
portant—the failure of “the populace”
to demand more severe measures against
those who were known violators of stu-
dent honor. Among this number the
writer must number himseif, tho he
hesitates to do so. We desire self-gov-
ernment, yet we are slow to furnish
facts (when we have theny) and de-
mand action. Jt is an essential part of
self-government that all students be
prampt to report all violations of it
which come within “their observation.
This is the part of “the populace’—a
part in which it has, to a very appreci-
able degree failed in the past.

The Student Council needs the back-
ing of a strong public opinion on the
part of “the populace.”

A MAKE-SHIFT FOR THE SWIMMING
POOL.

While waiting for the swimming pool
now looming uv on the horizon, whv
not. make use of the old cistern behind
the power house? This old cistern
(used for supplying water to the boiler
in case of emergency. not for drinking
nurnoses) built of brick and cement, is
sight feet deep and twelve feet in
diameter. On account of its circular
‘hane one would have to swim in a
~ircle, thus enjoving the delightful pleas-
“res of a merry-go-round at small ex-
sence, Jts nearness to the power house
vill facilitate the matter of heating the
-vater—only a short stretch of pipe
seeded,

Then years later when “Sonny's” in
-allege and we come up to the dedica-
tan of the new swimming nool, we'll
valk about the campus looking at the
Id familiar places and noint out to
‘annv_ the place where “daddy” went

WILLIAM L. MORGAN.

For the first time in several years,
Davidson has lost one of the members
of its Student Body thru the death of
William L. Morgan, of the class of
1920. William L. Morgan diéd in the
College Infirmary, after a short illness
of pneumonia, on December ith.

The following resolutions were sub-
mitted by the President of the Student
Rody and passed by them a short time
after his death:

Whereas, the all-wise God, our
Father, did through death take from us
on December 11, 1916, our college
mate. William L. Morgan, of the class
of 1920.

It is resolved that, we, his fellow stu-
dents, submitting loyally to Him who
in infinite wisdom and infinite love
makes no mistakes, but does all things
well, even tho it brings pain and anguish
into our lives; da place on record the
high esteem in which we held our broth-
er, whose life among us witnessed to his
manliness of purpose, to his faithfulness
to duty, and ta his conformity to the
Christian principles which he professed.
We sorrow and yet we believe that with
him all is well.

Tt is further resolved that a cany of
these resolutions be sent to the family
of our late fellow student with the as-
evrance that our sorrow mingles with
theirs. and with the praver that the God
of all comfort mav comfort their hearts.

And further, that a copv be published
in THe Davinsonian and the Presby-
terian Stndard.”

(Signed):

! The Student Bodv of
‘ Davidson College.

The following resolutions were also
passed by the Freshman class:

Our Heavenly Father has been pleas-
ed to take to Himself our class mate,
William L. Morgan. While we do not
alwavs understand God's providence, we .
do believe His acts are always right and
actuated bv an infinite love for His
children. We grieve over our loss and
are sad at the parting, vet knowing the
life of our brother as in conformity to
the Christian principles which he pro-
fessed, we believe that our loss is his
gain and he has found that “to be with
Christ is far better.”

We direct that a copy of this resolu-
tion be sent the family of our class mate
and published in THe Davipsontan.
