The DAVIDSONIAN, February 6. 1918

| LITERARY SOCIETIES || Southern Railway System

SCHEDULE.
Debate. Saturday night, February 9:
Resolved, That capital punishment

should be abolished.

Philanthropic —~ Affirmative: — Siske,
Brown and Caldwell. Negative: Mor-
ton. R. D. Hall and Peters. Orations:
E.G. Lilly, Currie and Freeman. Ex-
temporaneous: W. F. Hall and Chal-

mers.
Eumenean — Affirmative: — Liston,
Matthews and Mitchell. Negative:

Flinn, McPheeters and Orgain. Decla-
mation: McGirt. Oration: Potts.

For the second time within the week
the halls of the Eumenean Society re-
sounded with the merits and demerits of
the alien enemies, when on last Saturday
night the subject for discussion was,
“Resolved, That the successful prosecu-
tion of the war requires that all citizens
of Germany. Austria, Bulgaria, and
Turkey, now residing within the United
States. be interned until peace is secur-
ed.” The affirmative was represented by
Boulware, Good and J. B. Woods, Jr.:
the negative by Frierson. Mahood and
Flinn. Most of the speakers betraved
the fact that they had studied on the
question, and the debate as a whole was
better than the ordinary. The affirm-
aive contended that internment was (1)
necessary, (2) practicable, (3) in ac
cord with international law. (4) suffi
cient to remedy the evils. The negative
contended that it. would not go to the
root of the matter, that it was imprac
ticable, that it was not sufficient to rem
edy the present evils, that it was not con-
ducive to the successful prosecution of
the war. As you may see from reading
the above arguments. the affirmative and
the negative held the exact opposite
views on the matter, and this is a pleas-
ant change from the ordinary run of de-
bates in which the affirmative and the
negative hold no views at all. and take
eight minutes to tell us so.

The judges decided in favor of the
negative.

Declamations were given by W. P.
Cumming and A. M. McCaskill. These
declaimers selected the remarks of great
men to favor the society with, one of
them drawing his speech from Shakes-
neare, and the ather from Woodrow
Wilson.

PHI SOCIETY.

Using the same subject of debate
which was used in the intercollegiate
preliminaries last week, the  Philan-
thropic Society held its regular meeting
Saturday night, February 2. In the ab-
sence of President Fowle, the vice-pres-
ident, E. G. Lilly, took the chair. He
appointed on for debate F. 1. Knight,
Spence and Chalmers, and for oration
Peters. The debate was a very interest-
ing one. The affirmative based its argu-
iment on the activity of the German spy
svstem, while the negative used as their
main argument the illegality of intern-
ing aliens who are not enemies.’ ‘The
judges decided in favor of the negative.
The debate was followed by two very in-
structive orations by Peters and Worth.

A very timely subject was discussed
in an extemporanecous debate by Calhoun
and Dunlap. The question was. “Re-
solved, That the faculty should give full
credit for this term’s work on April 1
to all men who will farm or enlist.”” The
decision was won by the negative side.

There was a very good attendance.
Society adjourned after the president
pro-tem announced that the report of
the committee on improvements would
make its report next week. and that
every member was expected to be present.

For I, as man with men am linked.

And not a stone with stones; no gain

That I experience must remain unshared.
