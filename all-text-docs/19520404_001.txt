Red Cross Goal

The Davidson community con-
tributed over $1,300 to the Ameri-
can Red Cross Fund Drive which
closed Monday. This was 85 per
cent more than last year, and also
80 per cent over the assigned quota.
The Davidson College Student body
gave only about $100 of the money.

Om behalf of the American
Red Cross, Mr. Daggy and Lt.
Col. Ballard, the Davidson co-
chairman, expressed the sincere

will not go overseas until the end

of the summer. The exact nature

of his new assignment will not be
known until the end of April. When
asked about his leaving, Col. Bal-
lard remarked, “I wanted to stay
for a fourth year and if the Korean
war situation were not what it is,
I might have been able to stay. In
12 years in the Army, I have never
gotten more personal satisfaction
than from this work. It is going to
hurt to leave.”

He will have to leave his
newly-built home and his po-
sition of vice president of the
Lions Club. He said that he
wanted to stay through a whole
cycle and see a class go through
all four years.

Col. Ballard will be replaced by
Lt. Col. Ernest H. Davis who will
arrive in Davidson Sunday, April 6.
Col. Davis is a graduate of the Uni-
versity of Kentucky and has just
recently returned from a year and

a half of combat duty in Korea,

-room of Johnston Gymnasium when the Mecklenburg County Mo-
bile Blood Unit sets up on the campus for a two-day period. Dona-
tions by whole fraternities, such as the Phi Gams above, spearhead
drive officials’ hopes to go well above the state and regional record
of 448 pints contributed in one day——(Photo by Jack Scott.).

“Top 500” Is Goal
For Blood Drive

Next Wednesday and Thursday the American Red Cross
will conduct the second blood drive of the college year in the
Davidson community. The drive, sponsored by the ROTC de-
partment, staffed by the Davidson Civic League, and solicited by
Omicron Delta Kappa, will be held again in Johnston Gym.

It is hoped that this April's drive | ——————————————
can far exceed the community's
regional. record of approximatcly
five hundred donations in one day.

Those persons who wish to do-
nate blood will be given a con-
venient appointment hour. Appoint+
ments may be made directly with
the ROTC office between the hours
of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. It is intended
that, by close adherence to the
schedule and to a carcfully-de-
veloped plan of procedure, no one

release. Forms for this are availa-
ble at the ROTC building.

This particular blood drive is es-
pecially important, because urgent
appeals are being made by the gov-
ernment for more blood for the
Korean casualties. A greatly in-
creased quota has therefore been
assigned. Donors are assured that
the great majority of their blood
will be promptly dispatched, by air,
to the Korean conflict areas.

In going to the gymnasium for
blood YPonation, donors are re-
quested to enter at the rear en-
trancé, that is, on the north side of
the building. The facilities will be
set up in that end of the building.

Persons under 21 who wish to

Navy, A. Scott

Davidson's four debating teams
compiled an unusual number of wins
over March 28-29. Two teams of
two men each went to the Univer-
sity of Richmond and the U. S.
Naval Academy. The affirmative
team, composed of Hubert Cannon
and Roy Davis won at both schools;
while the negative team, composed
of Bob Mitchell and Will Terry
won at the University of Richmond
but lost to the U. S, Naval Acad-
emy.

This record of three out of
four was equalled by the two
teams at Agnes Scott. The af-
firmative team, Dick Gregory
and Dunbar Ogden, won five
out of seven matches, including
victories over the University of
Georgia, Georgia Tech, North
Georgia, Agnes Scott and Em-
ory, and losses to Emory and
the University of North Caro-
lina.

The negative team, Buddy La-
mon and Mac Williamson won’ two
and lost five, but this record is not
one to be ashamed of, since the
tournament was noticeably pro-
affirmative. Out of the eighty con-
tests staged, sixty were won by
affirmative teams and twenty by
negative teams.

Awarded Trip
To West Point

Wallace Abbott and Paul Cole
were chosen” yesterday by the
ROTC Department to represent the
Davidson unit at the U. S. Military
Academy's Sesquitennial Observ-
ances May I-4 at West Point.

All of the 110 ROTC students
chosen will be integrated into the
corps .of cadets for their entire
stay. They will take their meals
in the cadet mess hall with their
individual hosts, attend classes with
them, sleep in the cadet rooms, and
conform to the general rules gov-
erning the cadets.

They will wear their ROTC uni-
fofnis during the entire visit.

The object of the visit is to
give them an intimate view of
the methods of the academy and
how the other half of the Army
officers’ training corps team
lives; not to recruit men for
West Point.

Wallace Abbott ,a senior from
Kirkwood, Missouri, is a cadet ma-
jor, outstanding member of the
rifle team, and made an extraordi-
narily fine record at the ROTC

{summer camp last summer at Fort

Benning, Ga.

Paul Cale is a first sergeant in
the unit here and has had one of
the highest averages in his ROTC
class in the last. two years.

Abbott and Cole were chosen
froma field of 13 “good men,” with
the only regret, lt. Col. J. L. Bal-
lard, PMS&T, added, that so few
as two had to be chosen.

Has Three Top
Ideas Upheld

At a “Which Way Peace?’
forum next week Frederick J.
Libby, Executive Secretary of
the National Council for Pre-
vention of War: Gen. Robert
Ginsburgh, staff officer of the
Secretary of Defense, and Rob-
ert L. Humber, internationally
recognized world federalist, will
present their ideas on how the
U. S. can best achieve world
peace.

The forum will be next Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday in chapel
and the speakers will be on a panel
for an open discussion of their re-
spective arguments Wednesday
night at the Y. lounge.

Libby will defend the paci-
fist viewpoint, Gen. Ginsburgh
will advocate intervention, and
Humber is to review the case
for world federation.

The purpose of the forum is to
present to the student body the
different attitudes toward war that
are held in our country today. The
speakers were chosen so as to have
representatives of the three princi-
ple stands that the Christian could
take towards war.

The committee felt that this
topic was of great importance
in the light of the fact that
the majority of the present
senior class are going into the
armed services this summer,
and the rest of the student
body will eventually be in some
type of military activity soon.
The first speaker of the forum,

Mr. Frederick J. Libby, is a native
of Richmond, Virginia. He received
his A.B. from Bowdoin and studied
further in Berlin, Heidelberg, Mar-
burg, and Oxford.

He has been the pastor of the
Union Congregational Church in
Magnolia, Mass.. and did recon-
struction and relief work in France
in 1917 and 1918. He has been the
executive: secretary of the National
Council for the Prevention of War
since 1921,

General Ginsburgh was born
in Warsaw which was then
Russian Poland. He became a
naturalized citizen of this coun-
try in 1901. After having re-—
ceived his A. B. and LL.B.
from Harvard, he received the
A.M. degree from the Univer-
sities of Louisville and Mis-
souri.

He served in the Philippines in
World War I and served on the
General Staff Corps of the South-
west Pacific theater in the last war.
He has been an officer on the staffs
of many. cabinet secretaries includ-
ing Hurley, Johnson, Patterson,
and Royal.
