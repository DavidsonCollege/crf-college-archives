Fraternity Rights

As ironical as it may seem, the national fraterni-
ties have suddenly found themselves fighting against
“the system” for the rights of the individual student
to choost his own group of associates rather than hav-
ing them chosen for him. ,

For too many years to remember, the fraternities
were themselves “the system” at Davidson, and with
their procedures of selection and exclusion there was
little chance of such individual student’s rights being
considered. However, those days are now gone for-~

ever:

Now it is the fraternities whose rights are being
threatened. In their attempts to find housing and eat-
ing facilities independent from the college, they have
run into the obstacle of a discriminatory administra-

tive policy. >

oN
For several reasons, it would be aes the col-
lege to reconsider its position conce ff-campus
fraternities. Not the least of these’ is the fact that in
a court of law, if it should ever come to that, the
fraternities would probably win. ‘i

Furthermore, the college has been trying to pro-
mote the concept of,a “college community” which
would include the .surrounding town. It seems that
groups of students living as neighbors with the towns-
folk would be the best system for developing honest
relations between the town and the students.

Also, the idea that the college should have con-
trol over students associating together in self-selective
groups off the Davidson campus is repulsive. Any col-
lege administration that attempts to keep its students
on campus where it can maintain control over them
deserves. everything that it gets—-and more.

In Search Of Diversity

The current upheaval on the campus over the ap-
pearance of Rennie Davis at Davidson and the recent
appearances of William Sloan Coffin and Kate Millett
at Queens, raise the question of Davidson speakers in
general. eh se

As fine as the faculty of any given college may
be, off-campus speakers play an important role in the
over-all educational experience for the individual.

These outside speakers are counted on to provide .

fresh perspectives and different areas of professional
expertise.

The speakers for the last several years at David-
son seem to have fallen short, at times, of this mark.
There are several sources of speakers on this

campus including the Reynolds Lecture Committee, -.

the SGA Senate, the Public Lecture Committee, the
Piedmont Lectures Committee and the various depart-
ments. After a term or two of inactivity, the Senate
has contacted Davis, James Kilpatrick and William
F. Buckley. ’

Since the individual department can sponsor lec-
tures, (for example, the Honors College brought Peter
Heath to campus), the more public committees should
not be, primarily interested in the more academically
inclined speakers and should try to engage their
choices; from the non-academic community.

It is unfortunate that the Piedmont Lecture Com-
mittee did not select Coffin as.one of its choices. Cof-
fin represents the type of speaker that Davidson needs
to hear more often, personally involved in the cur-
rent events we hear about on the news. |

An historical approach to race problem. would
certainly be interesting to hear from a history or so- .
ciology department sponsored speaker, but the Pub-
lic Lectures Committee should seek to bring someone
involved in the reality of the situation, a Mayor Lind-
say pacer or Judge McMillan of Charlotte, for ex-
ample. at

. Davidson College deserves to hear contemporary
speakers from the podium as well as the television
set or printed page. ;

Real Issue In Davis F uss
Concerns Senate’s Duties

This week's burning cam-
pus issue has been the SGA
Senate's invitation to Rennie
Davis to speak at Davidson.

Chip Durant, who was last
mentioned in THE DAVID-
SONIAN when he appeared
in the list of SPE pledges
three years ago, has cast
himself as the charismatic

leader of a movement to .

prevent’ Davis’ appearance.

His efforts drew a televi-
sion appearance on WBTV,
stories in the Observer and
a flock of letters from trus-
tees, alumni, a ‘WBTV news
staffer and even one area
churchwoman, who charac-
terized Davis as the ‘‘anti-
Christ:” pees

Surprisingly, the college
administration has reacted—

with feathers unruffled.

ry told me he really didn’t

President Sam > Spencer's”

statement only established,

.in less than perfect gram-

mar, that legally the college
was not responsible for a
speaker's ditherings and
could not ban him for them,
that Davidson would not en-
dorse Rennie Davis official-

ly, that in his opinion the

students had been foolish
but not especially so and
that he was glad the Senate
planned to give equal time
to somebody from the other
side. r

The new fund-raiser, David

- Cornell, commented that in
his. opinion ‘having .Davis

speak would do no harm to
fund-raising,

plication asserting the con-
trary.

Cocnell’s opinion was bas-
ed on experience in similar
situations at other colleges,
and of course Davidson is a
special case, but I suspect
that Durant’s jétter. writers
really do not represent ‘the
people who contribute much
of the college's operating
funds.

This problem of represen-
tation has been the central
point of Durant’s ad hoc
movement. He claims the
Senate which invited Davis
originally - - the one which
just went_out of office - - was
unrepresettative of its con-
stituency, especially in this
case,

Durant rests his defini-
tion of ‘“‘unrepresentative’’
on what he claims to be the
central issue in modern -pol-
itical science: whether Bur-
ke’s idea of concern for the
group interest or the con-

cept of the elected leaders’

forming their policies on. the

basis of popular — opinion”

Should direct the acts of
elected bodies.

It impresses me as being
somewhat odd that the cen-
tral question in modern pol-
itics should ‘be concerned
with the writings of an eight-
centcentury conservative;
I thought ‘Walter Lippman
had exorcised that devil long
ago. * : er
‘ But. Durant resurrected ‘it

Monday at the Senate meet-
| ,

which would ~
seem td refute Durant's im- *

ing; having failed to carry
a motion to reverse the pre-
vious Senate’s decision (in a
roll-call vote there were al-
ready enough votes against
the motion to defeat it be-
fore the first affirmative
voice was heard), Durant
submitted a petition signed
by enough - students (one-
tenth of the student body) to
call for a referendum on the
matter.

This is the central issue
of the ®MavisDurant con-
troversy. If the SGA Senate
is to have prestige and
whatever meaning it can
scrape together, then its
elected members must be al-
lowed to make décisions. It
is foolish to go through all
this. election rigamarole _ if

.on all substantive issues a

referendum has to be held.

(All Durant’s other points
merely becloud this ques-
tion. Very few Davidson
speakers cost significantly
less than a thousénd-dollars;
that is the going rate. It is

- too much, but so are Ralph

Quackenbush’s cheesebur-

gers at the Hub which ° we
consume in large numbers.

One of Durant’s letter
writers commented that free
speech meant the right of
reasonable, responsible peo-
ple to be heard on an issue,
an opinion which I denounce,
abhor, reject and abjure but
which is also irrelevant.

“Whether Davis is in any
way articulate is also beside
the point, There is a rumor
to the effect that he is a
lousy speaker (the veracity
of which I cannot judge),
but Davidson has had enough
poor speakers before.

‘Anyway, the real question
is whether. students are go-
ing to allow the elected re-
presentatives to perform
their functions, one of which
is to invite speakers ‘of their

choice to the campus. I
think we ought to.
After all, those earnest

fellows at Senate meetings
have so few’ ways of attain-
ing fulfillment. Out of .com-
passion we should leave
them the,ones they have, if
for no better reason.

Secrecy Puzzles

Anxious

It was a warm afternoon
in late May. Davidson at its
best. The campus was dotted
‘with sun bathers on beach

.towels. But I was not out en-

joying the sun:

I was sitting on the floor
in the hall in front of the
Baxter Davidson Room‘ wait-
ing. It was 4:30 and I had
been waiting. for several
hours. Waiting to be admit-
ted for a few precious mo-
menis to the faculty meeting
going on behind the closed
doors of the Baxter David-
son Room.

The faculty was taking a
final vote on a proposal to
allow students on the Com-
mittee, on Admissions and
Financial Aid. Ran Coble
and T had been asked to
wait outside in case during
the. discussion’ (which we
were not allowed to hear).
“Questions arose.”’

We waited. For two and
one-half hours we waited,
eyes lifted up hopefully
everytime a faculty mem-
ber scuttled in or out, but
we never-were asked in.

The Director of Admis-
sions was allowed in during
the discussion ‘to present evi:
dence hostile to the proposal

listening through the door.
But we were never called.

The measure was defeat-
ed. We could not be tgld_ (un-
der the provisions of the
faculty constitution) who had
opposed.it or why they had.

A few professors whisper-
ed to us of our having.been
Stabbed ‘in the back and of
backlash to Kent State/Cam-
bodia activities. But’ all we
knew for sure was that we

Students

had waited and we had lost.

Almost a year has past,
and we're still waiting out-
side and listening through
the door.

I asked one faculty ‘mem-
ber last year why ‘their
meetings were closed.” “It's
a matter of freedom of
speech,’’ he explained. ‘‘The
faculty wants ‘to be able to
express. their opinons freely
and without fear of outside
pressure,’

Closed meetings also ‘al-
low the faculty to keep the
fate of Davidson College,
for all practical.’ purposes,
tightly within its grasp, to
keep faculty and students
forever on opposite sides of
closed doors, and to keep
specious and insupportable
arguments from being trac-
ed back to men who pride
themselves on their logic.

People at Hollins Jaughed

closed faculty meetings
went out with wearing ‘aca-
demic gowns to class,’”’ one .
professor here told me. But
it is unfair to say that fa-
culty meetings are complete-

dents can attend any one
faculty meeting.

favorite professor Monday
and ask him why faculty
