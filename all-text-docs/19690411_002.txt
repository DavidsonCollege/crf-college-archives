enthusiasm of the students and giving
them a chance to explore. The pro-
gram would mean a two-way division
of the four years of education: two
years of general exploration and two
years of concanteated major wark.

Behind Closed Doors

Ht has been an established practice
in an open, free and democratic so-
ciety, where decisions are supposedly
based on free interchange of idess
and the rule of reason and good sense,
ibat meetings of legislative groups
are open to atteadence and inspection
by those they govern.

But Davidson's faculty is nat this
way For whether they sre stared of
having students question their optn-
dons. Whether they are afraid af losing
the mivatique of authority which cames
from meeting secretly. ar for what-
ever renson, their alased moetlingy

Exhibit A: EPC

For 2 benulite! example of faol-
dragging, we offer as Exhibit A the
Educatlonal Policy Committee in con-
sidering the exain question.

Al this writing the committee has

The fsculty was indeed wise in set-
ting a deadline for the commiltee to
report back un ROTC; otherwise, the
proposal might never have been heard
of again.

But the conumiltee certainly needs
to move on the exam question, and

selves asserted.

Ub is net hypocritical to encourage
on one hand the porsuit of truth, ful-
ler understanding, free inquiry and
opon exchange of ideas and on the
other hand close io students proced:

IAN reporting. ~~ 6 ee

Nee ret Uncle Percival has removed a few of
the faculty's warts, it behooves me to turn to another
Mitte campes matter. Once again that annual rite of
spring, Greok Week, has come and gone, leaving the
fraternity avstem in full flower.

Greek Wook, this year as always. pointed out the
depths to which supposedly intelligent and mature
young men can sink in their sea for the eternal
Status and Prestige.

Mont fraternity pledge programs lonk like they
were charted by 2 blind mule in a snow storm. They
emphasize dip. trivia and all-around guane, aul they
pay ip tervice to “constructive projects.”

Tho fratornity system manifests its thorougha vine
hypocrisy through its organ of self-government, whiv!
— in fraternily terms — meanz non-government, the
Inferfralernity Council.

One of the main purposes of the IFC, as we ali
saw Inst fall. is to provide a cover for dirty rushing,
But by proclaiming s set of strict regulations and then
completely ignoring them, except in the most blatant
eases, the IFC allows its members to dirfy rugh al.
WIHT, for all practical purposes.

And the IFC extends this general approacit. to
regulation of pledge hazing during Greek Week. A
Mst of strinfent prohibitions was sent out to all {ra-
termities by bath the IFC ond the Dean of Studest’s
Office, Neurly all the fraternities viniated them. None
were punishod.

Ovr F © trainer said that he used the list of
prohibited uotlvithes cent oul by the Dean's Office
as the baals for his pledge program. He tried tn in-
elude them all,

it wasn't as if the IFC kavked ovidonce that hazing
was going on. Aa one hall counselor safid, “If they
wanted vuvidence, all they hed to do was ask seme
guys to drop trou.’

Ant the scavenger hunt that was held an the
lawa fa front of Chambers and around the library
al 9 p.m. was i litthe blatant, too. 1 would have been
difficutt for the IFC, administration ar anvhody lo
overlook a mob of blindfolded pledges in the middle
of the campus Lhat night.

Tho prasident of the IFC personally asked all
the fraternity pledge trainers not lo have scavenger
hunts. Then his fraternity did.

Oae of the big problems of fraternities is the
power they give to mediocrity. Those students who
can't or won't co anything else on campus throw
themselves wholeheortedly into iraternity activities.
"hey ure the most myopic and conservative members,
but take the lorgest part in whal the fraternity is.
