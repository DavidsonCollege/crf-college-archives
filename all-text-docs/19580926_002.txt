THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

PAGE TWO

FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 1958

(All Unsigned. Editorials by the Editor)

Our Cup Runneth Over

Sunday night's overflow condi-
tions at Vespers call. for immediate
action on the part of the faculty. It
is impossible for meaningful worship
to take place when students are
forced to sit in windows, on the floors,
on radiators, and the like. In fact,
this week some sixty-five students
were not able to squeeze into the sanc-
tuary of the Church at all; they heard
the service in Lingle Chapel.

The current proposal to exempt
seniors from required vespers seems
to be a good one, or at least the best
at hand. This proposal, in light of
present conditions, deserves the im-
mediate approval of the faculty.

However, it comes, to mind that
this week, as last week, we are faced
with symptoms of what is fast becom-
ing an impossible situation. Seven
days ago this paper was filled with
stories and pictures which dealt with
pallets in the gym and packed class-
rooms. This week a church which can-

not hold the bulging student body
demands attention. Who can tell
about next week?

One fact at least remains clear
and evident. The proolems at David-
son resulting from overcrowding can-
not be attributed to any major mis-
takes on the part of the administra-
tion, Mrs. Moore, Cop Linker, or the
waitress at the ‘greasy spoon.” The
Board of Trustees must accept the
blame for the deplorable conditions.
Their 1957 decision to increase en-
rollment is beginning to bring its
fruits to the campus scene.

A mistake has been made, but it
can at least in part be rectified. Now
is the time for the Board to act to
call a halt to any further increases
until facilities are available here at
Davidson to give additional students
an adequate education. The DAVID-
SONIAN urges that this action be tak-
en by the Board at the earliest pos-
sible date.

Last Resort Has
Been Reached

The Davidson College Bulletin for
February, 1916, contains this sen-
tence: “The public mess hall, or com-
mons, where scores or hundreds of
young men take their meals together,
with no lady at the table, and with
a salaried manager in charge who
has no pecuniary interest in making
the fare or service attractive, has nev:
er found favor with Davidson authori-
ties, and will never be adopted ex-
cept as a last resort.”

“The last resort has been reached.
At the present time, two hundred and
fifty-seven freshmen, plus a consider-
able number of independerit upper-
classmen, are jammed daily into the
undersized cafeteria of the College
Union. Despite the use of two serv-
ing lines at lunch and supper. the
queues of waiting students often ex-
tend back as far as the cigarette ma-
chines next to the student store,. and
during rush hours and on Sundays
they end bv curling around the bil-
liard tables.

And if the waiting student’s gusta-
tory expectations are sfill high by
the time he reaches the food, he is
likely to be sorely disappointed. For
despite the firm resolutions of 1916,
the cafeteria is now under the direc-
tion of ‘‘a salaried manager who has
no pecuniary interest in making the
fare or service attractive.’ The ef-
fects of this are immediately evident
to anyone who eats there.

The convenience to the college
of handing the College Union cafe-
teria over to the Slater Corporation
is indubitable, but no one can serious-
ly expect attractive food or service
from a commercial organization
which is interested solely in increas-
ing its profit margin—C.H.C.

Riots Must Go

Sunday night's so called “riot”
proved beyond any doubt that the
Class of ’62 is composed of freshmen.
It further proved, somewhat disturb-
ingly, that many upperclassmen have
never fully outgrown their own
freshmen days.

At the risk of sounding like grey-
ing seniors, we say that there is no
room on the Davidson campus for
such occurrences of mob action. Cer-
tainly the water throwing began in
fun, but during the heat of “battle,”

many of those involved had little idea
as to what they were doing.

The College was indeed lucky that
no significant personal injury or
property damage occurred.

The DAVIDSONIAN believes that
the Student Council, as the duly elect-
ed representatives of the Student
Body, should use more force in bring-
ing any similar future occurrences to
a sharp halt. Too often in the past
Council members have adopted the
“hands in the pocket, forced smile”
attitude toward such campus shenani-
gans.

No student would resent such ac-
tion on the part of council members,
elected to govern the Student Body
for the best interests of all.

Appreciation To
Dr. Graham

The DAVIDSONIAN wishes to ex-
press to Dr. Billy Graham its appre-
ciation for the interview (see Page 1)
which he so graciotsly granted to
Managing Editor Armfield.

We find his answers to Armfield’s
questions probing and _ significant,
perhaps reaching to the heart of our
college generation’s problems.

Doubtless there are many on the
Davidson campus who disagree with
Dr. Graham's theology and perhaps
his methods. No one can, however,
fail to respect his sincerity and con-
secration in doing what he firmly be-
lieves to be “the Lord’s work.”

We extend to him our best wishes
in his current series of services and
commend his messages to the Stu-
dent Body.

On Wildcats!

Last Friday night’s loss by the
Wildcats came as a shock to all true
Davidsonians. The reason for the loss
is about as difficult to guess as which
way a football will bounce, and frank-
ly, like most of the Student Body, we
were too numbed by Rush Week to
know just what happened.

One game, however, does not
make a season. Now is the time for
students and friends of the team to
let Coach Dole and his boys know
that we are still supporting them and
believe that they have the ability to
yet make this a memorable year for
gridiron triumphs.

EXPRESSES APPRECIATION

Changed Rush Week, Confirmation Termed
‘Most Successful’ By IFC President Anderson

By VERNON ANDERSON

In the eyes of this year’s IFC,
the recently completed rush
program fs felt to be one of
the most successful to date.

The two major revisions,
(pre-school rushing and revised
confirmation) of the past year's
procedures are pointed up as
the factors contributing to the
unusually smooth rush week.

Preschool rush pleyed a
prominent part in rush

week this year, for it bene-
fited freshmen end upper-
classmen alike. With the
slower schedule of Orien-
tation and Rush Week with-
out classes the rushee had
8 great deal more time for

consideration in his choice
of fraternity and the fra
ternities themselves were
afforded more time than
was previously accustomed.
This led to a generally
more concentrated rush.
One point of consideration
is the developnfent of «
more successful academic
beginning, elso, rather than
the faulty start which was
often the product outcome
of previous rush weeks.

The revised confirmation
system is the other factor
which made for a_ successful

rush week. The revised plan
called for a master sheet con-
firmation for the IFC rather

than the usual confirmation by
fraternity. The most desirable
feature of the revision is the
absence of pressure which was
often put on the rushee to give
extra or more desirable dates
to fraternities. The idea of the
personal master chart made the
process a great deal easier for
the inexperienced freshman and
the confusion of confirming
dates to two fraternities on the
same hour, was absent. This
plan also made the tedious job
of the council much easier.
Two suggestions for fu-
ture rush weeks are of
fered by the IFC as possi-
ble aids to en even better
rush week in the years to

Editors Note: From time to
time, as significant books
are published, the DAVID-
SONIAN will feature re-
views by students of these
books.

By CHARLES CHASTAIN .
Davidsonian Associate Editor

Only in America. by Harry
Golden; World Publishing Com-
pany; $4.00.

As a Jew, a native New York-
er, a second-generation Ameri-
can, and a liberal, Harry Gol-
den is about as alien in back-
ground and convictions to the
bulk of the Davidson Gentle-
men as another American can
be. But his Carolina Israelite,
published monthly in Charlotte,
presents a view of the South
“ag others see us," and his
voice is one that we would do
well to heed.

. GREAST BINGE

Only in America is a collec-
tion of several dozen short
pieces from back issues of the
Israelite, compiled by Golden's
son, with a foreword by Carl
Sandburg. They cover a mul-
titude of subjects: Jewish im-
migrant life on New York's
Lower East Side, where Harry
Golden was born and raised;
famous personalities, ranging
from Cleopatra (‘Now that’s
what I call ‘a girl’") to Billy
Graham; sharp comments on
our national foibles and short-
comings (‘America is on a huge
breast binge’); and the fasci-
nating trivialities of daily life.

But Harry Golden’s most per-
tinent comments—and the ones
which we will disregard only
to our own fetriment — are on

PEANUTS

the matter of racial relations.
To this problem he brings a
store of practical wisdom drawn
from his experience with all
types of humanity on all levels
of society, as wet: as a pene-
trating intellect, an entertain-
ing literary style, and a brilliant
wit that coats the bitter pill he
gives us.

DISCRIMINATION

In such long, sober articles as
“Negro and Jew in Dixie,” Har-
ry Golden describes a sad but
little-known facet of the racial
conflict in this region: its effect
on the precarious social posi-
tion of the Jews living in the
South, and the efforts of many
of them to dissociate themselves
from any movements toward re-
form. And in several short, sati-
rical pieces, he quietly but ef-
fectively reveals the humor la-
tent in our customs of racial
discrimination.

‘For example, there is the
Vertical Negro Plan, by which
white and colored children
would study side by side in the
same classroom—standing vp,
since raciat segregation has all
but been eliminated at grocery
counters, banks, dime stores,
ete.

CARRY-THE-BOOKS PLAN

Then there is the Carry-the-
Books Plan: “There is no ver-
tical segregation. But neither is
there ‘45-degree-angle’ segrega-
tion if the sitting or leaning Ne-
gro is a servant, a domestic, or
a chore-boy of some kind.
Therefore the Negro parents of
the South should make this
proposition to their local school
boards: that they will allow

their children to carry the
books for their white class-
mates. . . The girls should wear
a sort of miniature apron over
their street dresses. and this
would settle everything once
and for all. Everybody would be
satisfied.”

Harry Golden, whose newspa-
per barely eluded the creditors
for a long time, is now a suc-
cess in the best American tra-
dition, with a book at the top
of the best-seller list. We can
hope, however, that this Hora-
tio-Alger-type rise to fame will
not diminish his intellectual
non-conformity or his willing-
ness to take to task, when they
need it, his fellow citizens in
the region he has adopted.

LETTERS TO EDITOR

come. The idea of using the
services of the IFC itself,
other than the postal ser-
vice may lead to a quicker
and smoother bid distribu-
tion. This system has dis-
advantages itself, but they
may be outweighed by its
edvantages. The second

possible suggestion would

be the keeping of the be

fore-school time of rush
week unless a superior idea
could be formulated.

In closing, on behalf of the
IFC I express appreciation for
upperclass cooperation through-
out the orientation period.

OUT OF BOUNDS...

Comparative Scores

Prove Wildcats No. |

By TENNEY DEANE

Since this is the first time that I have been in print
this year, I would like to extend a special welcome to
all new readers of THE DAVIDSONIAN whose eyes hap-
pen to wander over this column.

I hope that printing “all that’s fit to print” won’t
keep my few words from brightening each Friday eve- _
ning when you settle down to read D.C.’s contribution to

journalism.

Many fans of the Davidson Wildcats were disappoint-
ed last Friday night when we lost our season’s opener
to Catawba College. Although many feel that they know
why we lost that game, I would like to justify the team’s
feeling of confidence in expecting to win.

Last year the ‘Cats had the best football team in the
country. By means of comparative scores I can prove
this. Davidson played and defeated the University of Rich-
mond last season. Richmond, however, beat William and
Mary who in turn edged out North Carolina State. If
you remember, State defeated the University of North
Carolina who had beaten the United States Naval Acade-
my. Navy had the good fortune of up-setting the boys
from Notre Dame, who in turn defeated the number one
team in the country, Oklahoma. My solution is simple:
Why should we worry about a team like Catawba when
we could beat the best team im the country?

Here is an announcement of interest: The Fine Arts
Club held its first meeting of the school year last Satur-
day evening in Statesville, N. C. Attendance was good but
down a little from last year due to “Rush Week” activi-
ties. Watch this column for future meeting dates. ‘

THE ICONOCLAST

Upperclassmen Angry

As Freshmen

By MARSHALL LAFAR

This column will be written
for students to express their’
opinions on their particular dis-
likes around the campué. If
you know of anything that does
not meet with your approval,
Iet this column know about it.

What's happening to us? Last
year the freshman class never
got to leave chapel until upper-
classmen had ieft the auditori-
um. This year there have been
some changes made,

When the chorus of “Sit
Down, Freshmen” is shouted,
things are somewhat different.
The freshmen, who have been
at Davidson less than a month,
merely hiss the upperclassmen
and resume their march out of
chapel. Upperclassmen, are we
losing our touch? Or do we just
not care any more?

While collecting ideas on
various “gripes” to write about,
1 walked into the room of a
good friend. 1 interrupted his

Stand Up

work by asking if there was
anything that aggravated him.
He quickly came back with,
“Yeah! People walking in my

room when I'm trying to
study!”
As everyone knows, there

used to be a quite noticeable
rise in the road between the
college laundry and Belk. This
rise caused a slight bounce on
a car that was going over five
or ten miles an hour. However,
there was a sign that announced
“BUMP” to traffic coming from
both directions. This rise in the
road was put there in order to
protect laundry pedestrians
from the danger of speeding
vehicles.

This so-cailed bump must not
have served its purpose. This
year there are two bumps, six
signs, and two hurricane
fences. Next year these will be
accompanied by a small draw-.
bridge.

Catalogue Error Pointed
Out, Squirrel Contributes

Dear Editor:

Realizing your reluctance to
have even the militant David-
sontan at variance with an of-
ficial publication of the Col-
lege, I still ask a few lines to

correct the error in the cur-
rent Catalogue (and the one be-
fore it): that fails to lst the
Ph.D. degree of one of our Eng-
lish staff, Professor Goody-
koontz. I think it should be
known that Dr. Goodykoontz
had his degree from the Uni-

versity of North Carolina when
he came to us last year.
