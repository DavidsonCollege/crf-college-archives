THE DAVIDSONIAN

PAGE THREE

LOOKING BACK

Mr. H. B. Arbuckle in his speech at the Athletic Banquet
mentioned that this sports season had been “one of the most
successful in recent years” for Davidson. Since no conference
championships were won what has made it so? Records are
the best testimony.

In addition to the track records in the 880, mile, shot put
and mile relay, the swimming team broke seven of their 10
records this year. They were the 50 yard freestyle, Tom Rivers
:24.1; 100 yard freestyle, Tom Rivers, :54.8; 200 yard individ-
ual medley, Bill Carrell, 2:30.3; 200 yard breaststroke, John
Edwards 2:40.9; 400 yard relay Speir, Winfrey, Carrell, and
Rivers, 3:49.4; 200 yard freestyle, Jerry Clark, 2:26.2; and div-
ing, Basil Sharp 65 points.

In basketball Hobby Cobb set new marks in field
goals, 200; free throws, 140; season points, 540; career
points, 1470; and career average 16.7. The team set a new
single game high of 108 points against Guilford and a
season total of 1816.

In football the Wildcats lead the conference in total
defense, but looked most impressive in averaging 150.1 yards
per game in passing to break a conference record set by
Maryland with Jack Scarbath in 1950.

The gift of $153 presented by Dave Regen of the “D”
club to Coach Whittle at the banquet was sufficient to com-
plete the fund started several years ago to pay for a curb
for the track to make it official and eligible for conference
meets.

ON LEAVING

The sports staff of the Davidsonian would like to pay
tribute to the man who has made the phrase “‘a little extra
effort” live for many Davidson athletes. Coach Carroll
Hambright helped make the Cat forward wall one of the most
feared on the gridiron in this area and his swimmers rewrote
the record books, but as the time approaches when he will
leave after a four-year stay, most of his friends will look back
and realize that Carroil wit be remembered primarily for
his hearty smile and laugh that cheered everyone around him.
