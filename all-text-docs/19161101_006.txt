OUR NEXT GAME
On Saturday of this week Davidson

will play Furman University, the game|’

to be staged on their home gridiron, at
Greenville, S.C. From all reports Fur-
man has this year the strongest team in
her history, and they have had uniform
success this seasoh. Probably their best
showing this year was against the always
strong Clemson Tigers, whom they held
to the very close score of 7-6. Furman
has a very heavy team this year, and will
outweigh the Davidson team = many
pounds to a man:

In view of Furman's showing so far
this season, the Red and Black machine
can hardly be expected to roll up as
large a score against them this year as in
the past two.

ELECTION RETURNS MAY
BE RECEIVED HERE

Efforts are being made to get direct
returns from the Presidential election
on November 7th. It is not certain yet
but it is hoped that telephone connec-
tions can be made between the Tele-
graph office and Shearer Hall, where
the students can hear the results of the
election.

DAVIDSON COLLEGE DAY

(Continued from page 1)

chants sell their goods, lovers win the
hearts of maidens, teachers drive knowl-
edge into the heads of their pupils that
they will learn in no other way, and
preachers make people believe. No mat-
ter into what walk of life we may turn,
we see humor as a main factor, Since
humor is such an important factor in life,
every student should strive to have this
humor. They should learn when, where
and huw to use it, for it is not always
the joke that we laugh loudest at that
teaches us the greatest lesson. Every
college man owes it to the world to
make the world lively and not dead.

He stated that the sea of life was a
sea far broader than the sea over which
Columbus sailed, but the crown that
awaits each one that makes this voyage
of life a success is greater than any re-
ward that the earth can offer. Every
one should have faith enough to ven-
ture out upon this voyage of life, for it
is certain that if we never start, it will
be impossible to get anywhere. Never
in the history of the world has there
been such an opportunity offered to
young men as there is today. But what
a young man will get out of life will
depend on how much he puts into it. If
he puts little into life, or does little to
make this old world better, he will get
little out of it.

After Dr. Whaling’s address, Mr. R.
M. Miller, of Charlotte, N. C., a class-
mate of Dr. Whaling and now Presi-
dent of the Alumni Association, gave a
very interesting talk on the relationship
of the Alumni to the college. He com-
pared the college to a. corporation with
its officers, hoard of directors and stock-
holders. The faculty is its officers, the
bourd of trustees its board of directors.
and the student body and the alumni of
the college represent the stockholders.
He said that every student and alumnus
should feel responsible to the college and
do all in his power to build it up. He
stated that a word of praise for David-
son from her students and alumni. all
over the country would be worth more
than all the world-wide advertising, and
in concluding announced that the Alum-
ni Association, realizing the need of
some inducement to encourage Fresh-
men, would give a medal at the end of
the term to the Freshman making the
highest’ average in his studies for the
year.

The exercises of the day were close
by the singing of a special Davidson
College Day song.
