Wrestlers start
with new coach

By TOM PAFFORD
Staff Writer

The Davidson wrestling team
opens its season under first year
head coach Bob Estock in the
Catawba tournament Friday
and Saturday.
The grapplers will be led by
co-captains Mike Garfinkel, a
senior wrestling at 158 Ibs., and
Rob King, a senior in the
heavyweight division. Also re-
turning from last year’s team
are Scott Smith, a sophomore at
134 Ibs., and Pat McKenzie, a
junior weighing in at 126 Ibs.
Coach Estock comes to Da-
yidson from a stint as head
coach at the Coast Guard
Academy, where he led their
matmen to a Division III
aational title. About this year,
he says, ‘““There are not ‘many

guys out for wrestling, but.

shose we have are definitely
willing to pay the price. I’m
really looking {ward to the
3eason.”

°Band BBlist top basketball players ; tell truth about women’s IMAC

By BONEHEAD and
THE BRICK BROTHERS
B&BB is off and running into

another exhilarating IMAC
season. Now Women’s IMAC
basketball takes over the head-
lines from flickerball, and as has
been the custom B&BB are
ready with the first and second
team Davidson All-IMACers.
G—Minor Sinclair, 6-1, 185,
Auburn, Alabama. Despite
being overweight, this guard
can run and shoot with the best
of them. Hel be leading the
perennial Hurtin 4 Certin jug-
gernaut into contention this

year.

G—Locke White, 6-0, 185,
Podunksville, U.S.A. Perhaps
the greatest thing to hit IMAC
since marjoune. Can do it all
from the backcourt position.
Locke could lead the SAE’s
back to the titlé game which
they missed out on last year
because they blew it. ,

G—Eddie Biedenbach, 6-2,
175, N.C. State. Eddie will have
to use all of his finely-bred dirty
tricks to pull out a champion-
ship for the undersized Old
Men. He remains a top-flight
basketball playér despite being
in the geriatric set.

F—James McLain, 6-3, 215,
somewhere down South. Pro-
bably the best rebounder in
IMAC. No one got in his way
last year when he led the Cool
Breeze to an IMAC champion-
ship. He can hit from outside
when he gets hot.

F—Andy McDonald, 6-2,
175, Elin, N.C. One of the
smoothest players in IMAC.
Andy was an integral part of
the SAE championship team of
two years back. Andy can
shoot, rebound, and dunk.

Sorry folks, no center.

Second Team

G—Alvin Atkinson, 6-0, 190,
X-ville, Georgia. One of the
toughest players on last year's
championship team. Alvin can

shoot from outside and move

‘em out inside. He can be a real
force when he gets good block-
ing

G-Roger Hodge, 6-0, 170,
HellifIknow. One of the most
aggressive players in IMAC. A
real hustler, who also shoots
well. No one seems to know who
he’s playing for, and we don’t
either.

C—Vince Parker, 6-4, 180,
Our Nation’s Capital. Vince is a
good man inside.who could be a
force with his shot-blocking
ability. Don’t be fooled, he’s a
helluva lot better at basketball
than flickerball, which Hurtin 4
Certin can take heart in. _

C—Danny Hock, 6-5, 190,
Winter Park, Fla. Probably the
toughest center in IMAC. He’s
also a good outside shooter.
Danny is an integral cog in the
SAE basketball machine.

F—Rand Malone, 6-3, 185,
Walla Walla, Wash. When he’s .
hot, he’s one of the best. But
Rand makes up for his lack of
consistency with the number of
shots he takes. Actually Rand
is a good rebounder and an
offensive threat who makes his
team & contender.

Two freshmen to watch are
“Stork” McDonald and Mike
Goode. Both could be in our top

Stockton to get the Outland
Trophy.

Hurtin 4 Certin came in a
very strong third after losing to
the KA’s 34-34 and the SAB’s
20-19. The Old Men, despite an
incredible dirth of talent and
extremely poor leadership on
the part of Frank and Shi,
managed to come in fourth.
Note none of the freshmen
teams did jack. That’s because
none of them are worth their
weight in caraway seeds.
