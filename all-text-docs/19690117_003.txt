Murphy’s Irreverent Style Brings Victory, Progress

By DANNY WHITE
Staff Writer

“People around here need to be shaken up a little!”

That was the sentiment expressed by Joe Murphy in
his campaign for the SGA Presidency last March, and
the same theme has carried over into his administra-
tion this year.

As a member of the now defunct Student Council,
Murphy cast the image of a maverick campaigning for
more student power and more practical luxuries such
as vending machines, coke machines and telephones.

This tone carried over into his campaign for the
presidency as Murphy blasted the Student Council
and the “good guy followers” that traditionally control
it.

“I think it’s time for ACTION by the student body,
and especially by its supposed leaders. The student
government needs to think rather than agree, to speak
rather than keep silent, to work rather than hope. We
can not afford another year of backing dawn.”

Murphy, then, began his presidency as a crusader
for student involvement in college policy and against
what he considered the major campus problem—stu-
dent apathy.

How well Murphy has accomplished his objective
is debatable. What is certain, though, is that his leader-
ship and brigade-staff-meeting tactics enabled the new
Senate to get off its feet and institutionalize the
SGA Constitution.

Murphy was able to act in his sometimes highhanded

Who

Steff Writer

Most Davidson students
don’t know who their stu-
dent body officers are.

A recent poll of 49 stu-
dents. selected at random.
revealed that. at least one
third of the members of
each class could not name
a single one of their three
class senators or their dorm
senator.

Only five of the 49 correct-
ly identified all of their sena-
tors and the president and
vice president of the Student
Government Association.

Perhaps surprisingly. re-
presentatives to the house
committee of each dorm
seemed better known than
dorm senators, especially in
the freshman class.

Ninety-foyr percent of the
freshmen polled and 93 per-
cent of the juniors knew both
the president and vice presi-
dent. All of the sophomores
and seniors knew them.

Thirty-four percent of the
freshmen polled knew none
of their class and dorm sena
tors, while 66 percent knew
some of them and 13 percent
all: of them.

Of the sophomores polled.
40 percent knew none of
their senators. Sixty percent
knew some of them. and
none knew all of them.

Thirty seven percent of the
juniors could identify none
of their senators, while 63
percent could name some of:
them and seven percent all
of them.

Of the seniors, 40 percent
knew none of their senators.
Sixty percent knew some of
their senators and 20 per-
cent knew all of them.

manner because his smashing victory over six rather
conventional opponents in the election seemed to ex-
press the mandate of the students for a new medium of
communication of their desires to the college hier
archy.

Before Murphy, student politics at Davidson had
been marked for by a quiet, behind-the-scenes, in-
dividualized approach. New ideas were versed in terms
that would offend none. Murphy’s supporters appar-
ently felt that the old method had either not proven
itself or that the situation better favored his less than
subtle, give - ’em - hell - and - don’t - take - any - bull -
for - an - answer approach.

Most of the candidates differed very little in their
proposals, but the real issue at stake was the means
to be used to achieve these objectives.

As a DAVIDSONIAN editorial pointed out at the
time, “‘Murphy’s election puts student government on a
mountain ledge, from which it can scale new heights
or fall into the valley of disrepute.”

Murphy’s type of approach has been successful in
colleges and universities outside of the South, but its
success on the Davidson scene has been both surpris-
ing and pleasing to most Davidson students.

Although not directly responsible for the Code of
Responsibility, Murphy’s Senate has expanded on its
themes of student maturity and invelvement, demand-
ing — and in some cases getting — such things as
drinking on campus, voluntary ROTC, fewer chapels
and open dorms.

That this year's accomplishments such as open
dorms and drinking on campus might have naturally
evolved from the implementation of the Code of Re-
sponsibility regardless of who held student power, is
of course possible. Still, it was Murphy who took the
fight to the faculty and trustees and garnered stu-
dent interest by such devices as opinion question

naires and committee appointments.

It should be pointed out that Murphy became more
tactful and resigned himself to working within the
system once he was elected.

Murphy was by no means the only one with fresh
ideas on this year’s Senate. It was largely through
the work and interest. of SGA Vice President Peter
Hobbie that the RHA became a reality and open dorms

were begun. The Free University was the brainchild

of sophomore senator Rich Cowart just as the radio

station owes its existence to another sophomore, Ed
obbs.

While generally a very effective body this year,
the Senate and Joe Murphy are not beyond criti-£
cism. In his haste to have his objectives accomplished,
Murphy managed to disregard both the SGA Consti-
tution and its bylaws. The Senate Executive Committee
has failcd in its duty to plan the agenda for each Sen-
ate meeting (what Murphy plans is what occurs.)

Only recently has the Senate begun to do its work by
committees, as evidenced by the ROTC and chapel
resolutions. However, until November when it achiev-
ed full membership, the Senate met as a whole every
week and went rather slowly about its business.

The Senate has also failed to punish excessive ab-
sences on the part of its embers. The chancellor,
the “workhorse of the Senate,” has not lived up to
his duties either.

_ Overall, Murphy's administration has accomplished
its basic objectives peacefully and with tact, with the
natural result of an increase in the awareness of stu-
dent power on the part of all concerned in the college’s
policy making processes.

Student government at Davidson, after a year of
Joe Murphy, is no longer perched precariously on a
mountain ledge between heights of excellence and
depths of disrepute. Most people would say it has
started up the climb to new’ heights.

Does It Matter Here?

Last Year’s Promises Revisited

Cool, Smile No Longer
studi. Ticket To Presidency

By JOHN WILLIAMS
Associate Editor

lt has Yeen said in the past
that all a person ‘needs’ to

get. elected president of the

student body is a warm
smile. a cool disposition and
a lot of fraternity votes. A
closer ¢xamination of past
elections reveals this state-
ment to be only half true:
although there are bits of
veracity in it.

The present. trend toward
activism has come to David
son only in mild form. It
was these activist tendencies
which Joe Murphy exhibited
by promising to “‘stand up
to the faculty and admin-
isstration.” The year before
it was the same tendency
which prompted Tom Earn-
hardt's promise to ‘do some
thing.” not just be «a. figure
head.'*

Although Dr. Chalmers G.
Davidson, director of the li-
brary, has insisted that stu
dents had real power in his
college days during the 30s,
it is apparent that the Stu-
dent Council did not wield
much influence four years
ago. Bill Council, who was
elected student body presi,
dent in March, 1965. cam
paigned on the platform of
maintaining the present fra
ternity system.

Council had served on the
Fraternity Evaluation Com-
mittee which recommended
the eventual abolition of fra
ternities, but had drawn up.
with four other students, a
minority report recommend
ing the maintenance of the
system. A torchlight demon-
stration in favor of this mi
nority report prompted Pro
fessor Charles Cornwell to
remark that ‘Davidson is
the only school where stu-
dents demonstrate in favor
of the status quo.”

Although Council had serv

tor.

His other projects includ-
ed investigation into the
traffic fines. the chapel sys-
tem and a student discount
service. The only concrete
proposal on his platform was
pass fail courses.

His wide margin of vic-
tory was due to his steady
image and the lack of other
outstanding candidates.

Matthews was succeeded
by Tom Earnhardt, who had
also been second vice presi-
dent of the student body. It
is often said that Earnhardt
began running for the office
his freshman -year. Like a
good politician, he started
programs which could be at-

tached solely to his name.
Tho Student Recruiting Com-
mittee and ‘the Educational
Planping Committce were
intended to populatrizé the
names of Davidson College
and Earnhardt at the same
time. He also revived the de
bate program almost single-
handedly his sophomore year
and served as president of
the Debate Club. He pushed
for a budget and a new
coach until people were tired
of listening, but he achieved
his goal.

His energetic image and
his firm maintenance of his
position as an Independent
were major factors in ‘his
election. His tireless cam
paigning and his notes read
ing ‘Sorry I missed you —
Tom Earnhardt’ made his
name a byword among the

Murphy too had made a con-

He was fortunate to be a
member of the Committee on

which provided the biggest
issue at election time. His
“give ‘em = hell” attitude
was reflected in the many

years.

Proper Campaign

Tactics Revealed

By ROBERT PYEATT
Associate Editor
To succeed in politics while appearing not to try is the goal
of a smal! minority of those who enter Davidson every year.
They come with high hopes and what they think are high

and noble ambitions.

Many begin running for the office long before they get to
Davidson. The election .is only the final step in a process begun

jong’ before.

There are two hasic ap
proaches to getting elected.
the open-mouthed and the
rear ended. Those who fol-
low the former course march
on to victory and those who
take the latter slide down
to defeat.

Here. is the formula for
political suceess used since
time immemorial by people
running for office at David-
son:

First a candidate should
absolutely major in history.
with political science only as
a last resort. although poly
sci majors have not fared
badly in recent years. Aviod
fine arts. physics and reli-
gion.

Cultivate electable quali
ties. Endeavor to look di.
ligent as much as possible.
especially when engaged in
student government _ busi-
ness.

The only office you should
ever run for is the Student
Council, or Senate, as it is
more grandiosely called now.
In past years the position of
second vice president was
considered the natural step.
ping stone to the presidency.
and holders of that office
went on to win the presiden-
cy for the seven consecutive
years up to 1968,

But since that office has
been abolished, a place on
the Senate will do.

Do not join any other
activities that will take up
valuable time you could be
using for campaigning or
taking expense paid student

government junkets to other
colleges to ‘‘study the educa-
tional system" or to high
schools: to “recruit outstand.
ing students."

Drink only bourbon and
and water, perferably in
your room during the day.
At night drink coffee.

There are several definite
organizations you should
join, and sume to avoid ab.
solutely.

“Success activities’ in-
clude: D Club; basketball.
football or tennis team:
Union deskman: fraternity
rush chairman: any student
government committee or
student faculty committee:
Richardson Fellows.

“Failure activities in-
clude: Phi literary society,
STEP, Lingle Manor,—The
Miscellany, Le Cercle Fran-
cais and THE DAVIDSON.
IAN.

The propective candidate
should be seen hurrying
across campus looking busy
as often as possible. He
should dress with a. studied
casualness and salt his vo.
cabulary with the right
amount of profanities and
have a gift for relating ris-
que stories that he claims
were told him by some fa-
culty member.

He should show his pre-
ference for the proletariat
by dating at Queens and
wolfing an occasional pizza
at Lefty's. but be above fre-
quenting the Hub late at
night.
