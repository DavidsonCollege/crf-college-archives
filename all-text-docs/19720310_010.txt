VISTA. ‘A Volunteers

By BILL ELLETT
Copy Editor

Volunteers In Service To
America (VISTA) and the Peace
Corps will be looking for volun-
teers at Davidson next week.
Laura Larson, who has worked
with VISTA in Missouri, and Lib
Haubenreiser, who spent two
years in Liberia with the Peace
Corps, will be in the Union lob-
by Wednesday, Thursday and
Friday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
with literature about the organ-

izations. Interested students may
fill out applications but any cur-
ious person may get the litera-
ture.

Haubenreiser said that though
applications are accepted from
anyone over 18, graduating sen-
iors are preferred since there
is such a big change in environ.
ment between the Ivory Tower
and the areas where volunteers
work.

Both programs look more

Trustees Delegate Power

by ALAN FORD
Staff Writer

The Trustee Governance Com-
jnittee at its last meeting Feb-
ruary 10, allocated governance
control over certain aspects of
Davidson College management
to the constituency on campus
that has the primary responsi-
bility for that aspect.

The committee agreed that
the administration should have
primary control over the fol-
lowing: religious policy, cap-
ital expenditures and _ invest-
ments, development and public
relations, management of auxil-
iary enterprises, public plant,
student charges, operating bud-
get, athletics, recruitment of ap-
plicants, staff and faculty pro-
fessional matters and student
health services.

The Faculty should assume
primary control over curricu-
lum, library, honorary degrees,
co-curricular activities, physical
education and intramurals, and

policy of admissions and selec-
tion of applicants.

The students should control
the social life of students, dorm
life, food service, student gov-
ernment and organizations and
student conduct.

The committee agreed that
the governance role for many
of the listed cases should be
shared extensively with the oth-
er groups.

Sanford Seeks Presidency
Based On Student Support

By PHIL BISHOP
Staff Writer

Duke University
Terry Sanford this weeek an-
nounced for the Presidency on
the strength of his student sup-
port and cn Edmund Muskie's
reatively weak showing in the
New Hampshire primary.

Sanford said Wednesday in
Durham ‘‘the confidence and en-
thusiasm of the students who
started the petition drive” was
the key factor in his decision.
North Carolina students collect-
ed 25,000 signatures in less than
i month to put Sanford’s name
on the state primary ballot.

“These young people are seek-
ing our political system to be
responsive to their aspirations.
As a state and as a mation, we
cannot afford again to frustrate
our youth,” Sanford said.

Si: nator Muskie “‘has not
caught the imagination of the
people in a degree that can car-
ry him to success in the fall
elections,’ remarked the for-
mer governor, ‘‘and if he fal-
ters, the delegates will most
likely choose a fresh face.”

Sanford will remain im his po-
sition at Duke during the cam-
paign. He said he hoped to dem-
onstrate an alternative method
of campaigning free from
heavy media advertising.

Sanford plugged his candida-
cy aS am opportunity for the
South to offer real solutions to

Needed

plicant than toward the type de-
gree. Experiences in organizing
people, in recreational pro-
grams and in farming are good
but not necessary.

Members of the Peace Corps
receive subsistance payments of
between $70 and $160 per month,
but Haubenreiser claimed to
have saved money, due to the
low cost of living in Liberia.
VISTA subsistance is higher
with the high cost of living in
the U.S. A bonus is given at the
end of employment of $50 for
each month worked.

Training for VISTA volunteers
runs about six weeks, two weeks
in a training center and four
weeks in the field. Peace Corps
trainees take 12 to 14 weeks
learning their jobs due to Jan-
guage training.

Commitment to the Peace
Corps is two years, VISTA takes
u one ycar commitment. Neith-
er organization can serve as a
substitute for the draft.

the nation’s problems. ‘‘We are
now mainstream America, and
we know the unfulfilled prom-
ises of this nation. We cannot
disqualify ourselves from  na-
tional politics.”

Sanford reiterated his opposi-
tion to the Vietnam war, say-
ing, “our unwarranted military
attacks in Vietnam, Laos, and
Combodia is an obstinate addic-
tion to a discredited policy.”
Sanford also added he would
welcome the repatriation of fug-
itives from this country’s draft
laws, but he opposed legaliza-
tion of marijuana. —

Davidsor’s Danny Clodfelter,
who was singled out by Sanford
as a key leader of the petition
movement, acknowledged the
difficulty of entering Sanford in

other primaries. ‘‘There has
been some talk of Oregon, but
Alabama may be the best
chance to get primary dele-
gates,” said Clodfelter.

A good showing by Sanford in
North Carolina and Alabama
could significantly reduce the
strength of George Wallace at
the Democratic Convention in
August. Sanford said he would
need at least 100 delegates to
create a presence at the Miami
convention.

Clodfelter said Sanford must
have delegates from four states
to be nominated at the conven-
tion, but he plans on support in
South Carolina, Virginia and
Texas as well as primary dele-
gates from North Carolina and
Alabama.

Bent Coins Cause
Jammed Machines

By BRUCE MALOY
Staff Writer

If you’ve lost any money in
the Union vending machines
lately, go see manager’ Ron
Scott. He has a drawer full of
bent and mutilated American
coins as well as British, French,
Canadian, Australian and Lux-
emburgian coins which might
belong to you.

As Scott explained, ‘‘All of
these coins have caused our
machines to jam in the past
three weeks.” Assistant manag-
er Keith Carson pointed out,
‘‘These machines aren't human.
They’re made to take only
American coins in reasonable
condition. When anything else is
put in they don’t know what to
do with it.”

Carson added, ‘“‘Once a ma-
chine is jammed, ten to 100
people could lose their money
before we are notified.”

‘“‘Remember,’ added Scott,
“‘we have never refused a re-

.fund to anyone who came and

asked for it in person.”

When asked why he used ma-
chines at all since they are so
abused and maligned, Scott re-
plied, ‘‘We have contractoral ob-
ligations to provide some sort
of food service after the’ cafe-
teria is closed and as strange as
it may seem some people buy
drinks and sandwiches from the
machines ever when the snack
bar is open.”

In response to questions about
the quality of the food, Scott
stated that the best available
packaged foods are being used
and that items such as sand-
wiches and hamburgers come
right off the line at the college
cafeteria.

These problems are all rather
academic, however, since only
a few vending machines will be
used next year. Almost all of
the machines will be replaced
by the snack bar on Patterson
Court which will be open from
7 a.m. to 11 p.m. or midnight.
