Wildcats upend Cocks

The Davidson College
baseball team toppled the
Cocks 4-3 behind the 14 hit pit-
ching of Joel Tew Tuesday night
in Columbia.

South Carolina was fifth-
ranked in the nation with a
record of 34-3 including ab-
solutely no losses at home.

Having witnessed the um-
piring coach Bobby Richardson
(ex-Yankee) gets it is doubtful
they will lose again at home un-
til Davidson returns.

" beating Notre Dame at South
Bend. It’s not that feasible, but
it happened...just ask the
Gamecocks.

So enough of the emotional
diamatic survey. Davidson was
sky high and ready to kick some
Gamecocks tails. South
Carolina.was extremely cocky
and nonchalant in their ap-
proach tothe game.

The game was scoreless for
the first 314 innings with both
teams missing sceveral scoring
opportunities. In the bottom of
the fourth Jeef Gantz hit a two-
run homer for Carolina to give
them a 2-0 lead.

But in the top of the sixth the
Wildcat bats came alive in a
hurry. Gary Pomeroy singled
up thé middle and George
Weicker hit an outside fastball
over the right field fence for his
ninth home run of the year and
a tie ball game.

Mark Rodgeman singled in
the hole and then Eddie
Willingham blooped a Texas

bunt and Terry Hummel, run-
ning for Rodgeman, beat the
throw to third. Still with nobody
out Billy Todd lashed a two run
double to right to give the Cats a
42 lead.

Tew allowed an unearned run
in the bottom of the sixth and
then pitched out of jams in the
eighth and ninth innings getting
cleanup hiter Dave King to fly.
out to Mitch Stone, touching off
a joyous celebration for the win-
ners.

Tew increased his record to 6-
4 as he displayed some of the
clutchest pitching ever seen on
a college diamond.

For the Wildcats, who had
beaten Catawba 14-4 and Fur-
man 11-7 in a comeback thriller
it was their 17th win against 14
losses moving them closer to
their 20 win goal.

The win over Carolina meant
even more for first year coach
Junior Wades charges as they
had to bounce back from a hear-
tbreaking 5-4 loss to Pfeiffer
Monday despite Mike Halls fine
pitching effort.

After the South Carolina
fame, coach Bobby Richardson
did not seem to be able to han-
dle the loss as he told the David-
son team to ‘‘cool’’. their
celebration and also told Terry
Hummel: “‘nice game, son...get
a haircut.” Do it coach. .

To me the most beautiful
sight in the world is a fly ball to
Mitch Stoné, a_ silenced
Carolina crowd of 3000 and a
steaming Bobby . Richardson,
who can’t believe what he just
saw.

Face it Bobby, Davidson’s
baseball team came to play this
year and will win 20 games,

conference, ‘and satisf

Spring is sprung yet again:
More baseball business told

At last the weather. seems to
have realized that it’s the end of

. April and 60 degree weather

just isn’t good enough. Spring
fever is seeping its way into the
student body, accompanied by
those three major side effects:

craziness, allergies, and
professional baseball.
Charlote, that bustling

metropolis in progressive North
Carolina, refuses to telecast
NBA or NHL games. However,
not even they would dare com-
mit the federal crime of not
showing baseball.

Though the season is still
young, there are many develop-
ments which have provided the
rabid fan with hours of
speculation. First, there is the
already publicized Catfish Hun-
ter. Sporting an 0-3 record, Cat-
fish goes to the mound today
against the hated Bosox.

Being a diehard Yankee fan, I

keep telling myself he’ll come

around with the warm weather.
It seems, though, that Catfish’s
finger was injured in the of-

fseason from excessive trigger
pulling. He now has the bad
habit of throwing hanging cur-
veballs. If he doesn’t recover
soon, Hunter may contract neck
cramps from watching balls
being hit out of the park.

The Kansas City Royals have
started the season hot, but this
is no real surprise to the
seasoned fan. The Royals can
hit as well as anyone, but it
remains to be seen if their pit-
ching will hold. The powerful
Oakland A’s circus is right
behind them, and_ with
weaknesses from trading it
remains to be seen if they can
get their title as easily as
before.

In the N.C. East, the Chicago
Cubs have started off hot, but
will probably melt before
August. It should be a race bet-
ween the Phillies, Pirates, and
Cardinals. If the Phillies can
get some consistent pitching
from Carlton and Twitchell,
they could get their first pen-
nant in light years.

The N.L. West contains what I
feel to be the surprise team in

baseball, the San Diego Padres.
They have seasoned veterans in
Willie McCovey and Tito (Hog
Dog) Fuentes, and two young- |
sters named Winfield and Ivie
who show great promise. The
pitching will need time to get
used to the majors, and the best
the Padres can hope for is third
place behind powerful Los
Angeles and Cincinnati.

This division also has the wor-
st team in baseball, the Atlanta
Braves. It is too bad that Ralph
Garr and Dusty Baker must be
saddled with this team. Atlanta
is not a baseball town and will
probably never have the finan-
ces to produce a winner.
However, at the rate New York
City is moving down there, you
never know.

It looks like the summer will
produce some good races, with
perhaps a surprise winner or
two. I won’t even attempt to
make any predictions, but I do
promise a few Molson’s will be
drunk while watching the ball
games. Maybe it will be a great
summer and NBC will realize
now dumb Kurt Gowdy is.

capability that all the players
have known they could have for
the past 3 or 4 years.

Davidson will conclude its fir-
st winning season in a long time
with a home game May 1 a-
gainst Lenoir Rhyne, marking
the last appearance of senior re-
gualrs Weicker, Lynn, Rodge-

man, Stone, Pomeroy and Todd.
