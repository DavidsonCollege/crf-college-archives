Official Story explores horrors of totaletarian society

By PRISCILLA FAUCETTE

A compelling and symphonic
film is The Official Story by
Argentine director Luis Puenzo.
Its historically realistic setting is
in Argentina, 1983, just after the
Falkland War and shortly follow-
ing atwelve year military dictator-
‘ship.. During this period, the gov-
ernment had “protected” its citi-
zens from Communist dissidents
by “disappearing” them. This
film, concerns itself brilliantly

inspires questions in Alicia con-
cerning her daughter’s back-
ground. In one of the most touch-
ing and excellently performed
scenes of the film, Ana laughs and
cries as she tells Alicia about her
personal. experience being tor-
chered and raped and about the
fate of several other women,
whose babies were killed or stolen
to be put up for adoption. From
this point on, we see a gradual and
painful awakening of Alicia as she
sets out on a persistent quest for

the real parents of Gaby — a quest
for truth.

The camera moves effectively
amongst the characters and dis-
cretely from emotionally tense
scenes to serene, childlike ones.
Puenzo wisely opts for close-ups
as his primary technique for char-
acterization. We are not merely
watching these characters; we feel
with them their horror, pain, frust-
ration, and sadness. These emo-
tions culminate in the final explo-
ding scene of violence, affection,

with how this era of horror affects
one woman.

A very moving performance i is
given by Norma “Aleandro as
Alicia, a history teacher who iron-
ically seems naive and unin-
formed about recent political eve-
nts in her own country. She leads a

‘ comfortable and happy life with

her husband, Roberto (Hector Al-
terio) and their adopted and
adored daughter Gaby (Analia

' Cadra) until a visit from an old

friend Ana (Chunchuna Villafane)

and love between husband, wife
and daughter.

The Official Story is an excel-
lent film in virtually all aspects,
but its genius comes from its har-
monious and powerful compari-
son between the real-life brutality
of a society and its far-reaching af-
fects on a family. Showings are in
Love Auditorium Saturday night
at 8:00 and Sunday night at 7:00,.

Exploring memories past and future of McDonald’s

What's new around David-
‘son? Seems like a silly question
doesn’t it? Well the purpose of
this column is to inform you, the
lucky reader who has made it this
far in the paper, that there are in-
deed many (well at least a few)
new things around the campus.

For example,
thrown together student sculpture
display in front of Cunningham,
which sits waiting for self- con-
sciously confused students who
call themselves artsy, avant
garde, and “in touch” to amble by
muttering later to like-minded
friends “Oh, | thought it was re-
ally neat.” Waiting in front of
Hodson like some great sacrifice
to some great tribal god that these
pretentious folk call Art.

Waiting for some unwitting

‘photographer to stumble onto,
photograph, and submit to the
measly arts page and for drunk

Streep and African safari enrich Out of Africa

By MARK CHEN
Out of Africa is both a great
adventure and a great love story.
The adventure lies in a naive, hap-
less maiden who goes into the
depths of Africa. In the wilderness

she battles the elements, tames_

fierce tribesmen and creatés a

proper Western farm and parlor on °

the Savage Continent. The ro-

__mance lies in the great love be-_

tween her and a man who has en-
dured the frontier hardships, a
man of great strength and utter de-
votion. ~~
In Out of Africa, that relation-
_Ship is between~the Baronness
“Karen Blixen and her trusty man-
servant and translator. A fling
with Denys Finch-Hatton is
mostly pointless.
‘ The Africa that we know

today is not the stuff of Hol-

lywood. It is mostly populated by
starving children, white suprema-
_ cists and quaint Marxists spouting
_ slogans which went out of fashion
in the West twenty years ago. Yet
when the European nations di-
vided Africa up into colonies, it

was a land for romance and big-

budget pictures. Out of Africa isa

throwback to that era. Despite

being made in the eighties, the
movie is essentially about a
dreamworld which no longer

exists. Out of Africa evokes aland —

of loyal servants, great white hun-
ters and wild beasts. The Africa
which is portrayed never really
existed, except in the adventure
__books of the 19th century.

The movie is based on the
writings of Blixen,’ who wrote
under the name of Isak Dinesen. It
begins with the Baronness, a
Danish lady who is setting off for
Africa. Meryl Streep has this lead-
ing role. The.time is 1913 and the
place is Kenya. Her husband

Bror, played by the great German .

actor Klaus Maria Brandauer, has
taken her money and invested it in
a large farming estate. Despite her
inexperience, Karen soon takes on
the conditions of the Dark Conti-
nent and wins. While the irrespon-
sible Bror goes off to hunt, Karen
sets everything in order on the es-
tate. The ignorant and numerous

tribesmen are soon under her com-
mand.

Karen is less successful when
she confronts Denys Finch-Hat-
ton, played by Robert Redford.
He is a hunter and leader of safaris
in the African wilderness. Natur-
ally, Denys falls for a woman who

is every bit as strong and indepen-

dent as he is. But Karen discovers
that while Denys loves her, he will
never stay very long with her.
While. Karen devotes her life_to
caring for her estate and her ser-
vants, Denys roams the continent
without making commitments.
The main theme of the movie be-
comes this battle between free-
dom and security, between the
wanderings of Denys and the con-
_cerns of Karen.

This may be the theme of the
movie, but Out of Africanever
makes you take it seriously. For
one thing, the intended, epic ro-
mance between Denys and Karen
fails. The failure is not due to
Meryl Streep. Though she is most
famous as the beaten-down
Sophie, Streep manages to play a
strong and decisive heroine. She
seems credible as Karen, a woman

. who can live on the African fron- .

tier in an elegantly furnished
home. Redford does little if any-
thing to live up to his epic billing.
The Denys of Dinesen’s tales was
an English hunter, but Redford
never even bothers with an En-
glish accent. Redford mostly re-
lies on his epic American looks, a
trick which might have worked
with Clark Gable. but Redford is
no such legend, despite the pro-
motion of Hollywood studios.
The love of Karen for the negli-
gent Denys seems a mistake in
such a sensible woman.

. The movie was directed by
Sydney Pollack, and he tries to
liven up the romance with epic

_camera angles. The viewer sits

through _ panoramic, languid
scenes in which Denys washes
Karen’s hair, they shoot lions,
they fly in his plane and'stalk Afri-
can game. My own opinion is that
National Geographic pictures are

_fine in the magazine, but I get

bored by their documentaries.

another.
. The movie is entertaining in

the smaller elements, ,Brandayer,

plays well as the charming but un-
reliable Bror. Despite doing a
number of things to make her life
miserable, Karen and Bror remain

‘believable as friends. The most

touching and romantic scenes
come between Karen and her
manservant. By repaying each
other with complete loyalty, they
truly seem to be in love. -

There are also funny moments
provided by the supporting cast.
Above all, the adventure story is
enough to keep the movie interest-
ing. Despite the literary preten-
sions of the script, the movie
works best as an African safari.
Out of Africa is really like the re-
treads of recent years done in the
Hollywood style of the past. The
best point of the movie is enter-
tainment.

_ If these virtues seem too small
to you, then don’t go to see Out of
Africa. But if you want a pleasant |
movie for two hours, then pay the
99 cents that the Union i is charg-
ing. The Union is also giving
