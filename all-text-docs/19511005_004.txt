Charlotte Symphony STUDENT RED FEATHER GIFT AIDS

It isn't just the crowded city
areas that need the 21 Red Feather
Services of our Community Chest
Most of these services are equally
needed—and used—by residents of
county towns and neighborhoods.

The’ most remote home im Meck-
lenburg County is less than 30
minutes from the nearest Red
Feather Service. In these homes,
iNness or physical handicap may
enter. Family worries and child
problems may come.

Young people will need the
health-building, character-building
programs of the Girl Scout and
other youth -esrvices. Atl over
Mecklenburg there are people who
are using Community Chest Red
Feather Services.

A third of all Girl Scouts in
Mecklenburg County live outside

Charlotte and belong to the 26
county scout troops,, Davidson has
3 troops, Huntersville 1, Cornelius
4, Derita 2, Paw Creek 1, Sharon
Church 3, Sardis Church 3, Craig
Avenue Church 1, Matthews 2,
Morris Field 1, Mulberry Church
2, Homestead Church 1, and
Pleasant Grove Church 2.

This past yeat it required an in-
vestment of nearly $5,000 or $200
per troop, to keep the Girl Scout
program alert and effective in
these county communities. These
expenditures were carefully re-
viewed by the Chest Budget Com-
mittee and approved as the very
minimum needed.

This investment made it possi-
ble to recruit and train the many
volunteers, promote activities such
as troop and day camping, and

maintain the Girl Scout office with |
its small but necessary clerical and
executive staff.

Sixty children were cared for in
temporary foster homes last year
by Family and Children’s Service.
Fifty were placed for adoption. In
all, 1402 Mecklenburg families
were served. Four hundred and
nine of these persons lived outside
Charlotte. ve

Aid given by this vital Red
Feather Service also includes
counseling on personal and family
troubles, or on problems caused by
HIness or absence of parents, Aid
to homeless babies and unmarried
mothers—legal advice (through the
co-operation of the Mecklenburg
Bar <Association)—emergency _ fi-
nancial aid—care of neglected chil-
dren and vocational guidance.

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 5, 1951

Twenty-five per cent of the na-
tion’s hospital: beds are occupied
today by mental patients. The
Charlotte Mental Hygiene Clinic
exists to reduce mental illness. It
pursues this aim by treating those
who are already sick, by preven-
tion in the case of those likely to
become sick, and by educating the
public to better understanding of
the causes and effects of mental
iNs. Thirty-four of its clients this
past year were from county com-
munities.

The Mecklenburg Association for
the Blind works to prevent blind-
ness, aids the visually handicapped,
and assists in making life more
satisfying for the blind of the en-
tire county. In all, 98 children and
and adults from rural Mecklenburg
were supplied with artificial eyes,

DAVIDSON COMMUNITY

repairs on glasses, or benefited
through eye examination and ‘sur-
gery.

These are only a few of the
services active all over our county.
The important fact is that they are
needed.

Other services like the Salva-
tion Army, the YMCA and YWCA
serve us all by making our County
a better place in which to live.

Also included in the Chest budget
this year is the U. S. O. which
watches over the welfare and
boosts the morale of our youth in
service throughout the world as-
suring them this home away from
home. Another Red Feather
Service is the Children’s Home
Society of North Carolina, which
cares for homeless babies and
places them in adoptive homes.
