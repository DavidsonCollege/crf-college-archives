Improved Menu

The trustees approved a
Hist of recommandations
drawn up by the business
office for improvement of
the Union Food Service at
their meeting on May 9.
‘The recommendat-
fons, prompted by the C rat-
ing which the cafeteria re-
ceived earlier this year, are
the results of meeting be-
tween ARA Slater, students,
and the administration.

The Stater representatives
met with a student food com-
mittee and several proposals
were drawn up. including set-
ting up a continental break

fast. upgrading the menu,
and expanding snack bar
service.

Since most students) who

eat at the Union don‘t eat
breakfast as itis now served,
it was felt that such a con:
tinental breakfast arrange-
ment was needed. The bréak-
fast ‘menu will include juice,
todst. sweetrolls or dough
nuts, and a beverage to be
served from the regular
breakfast time until around
ten o'clock.

The upgraded menus will
include not only improving
the standard fare, but allow-
ing a student to order a steak
or something similar on most
nights of the week for a small
fee,

The snack bar will supple-
ment the present machine
service by serving ice cream
and milkshakes.

Japan Moves Against Disorders

The Japanese government has designed a pro-
gram to aid preventing and restraining the student
disorders which have marred Japanese higher educa-
tion over the past several years.

The government's suggestions include telling all
universities that it is the police rather than the ad-
ministration who shall decide on intervention in case
of disorders, ordering state-run universities to report
to the Ministry of Education whenever their campuses
appear to be imperilled, and cutting the budgets of
universities now involved in disputes.

However, the head of prestigious Tokyo Univer-
sity has said that -he will decide whether or not to
allow police to preserve order on campus, opposing

the government decision.

Students Invade U-Va. Faculty Meeting

About thirty-five students at the University of
Virginia entered a closed faculty meeting until one of
their number was allowed to speak.

The student who spoke told the faculty of the
college of arts and sciences that he was leaving not
because of a threat of suspension but because the stu-
dents action had failed to gain any response from the
faculty, continuing, according to the speaker, a lack
of. communication that had existed for 150 years.

Presbyterians Ask ‘End To Cuban Embargo

The General Assembly of the United Presbyter-

The Cuban resolution was part of a longer Latin

cise of restraint and redirection of power” by the
United States in Latin America.

Dr. Malcolm Partin, assist

just completed a book en-

The book, published by the

jes the anti-clerical move-
ment in France the 19th

against the Roman Catholic
Church.

Partin maintains that cler-
icalism was primarily politi-

focus of his book. He did
most of his research while
in Paris as a Fulbright Fe!-

A REVIEW

By J. GILL HOLLAND
Asst. Professor of English

The first issue of “The
Miscellany: A Davidson Re-
view" under the genera} edi-
torship of George House
gives us much to praise in 4he
way of poetry and make up
as Davidson College's lit-
erary magazine.

House sensibly provides
enough poetry by the featur-
ed poets of each section to
read into them a little and
get a sense of their own
idiom.

Peter Wild won first prize
in the “Miscellany” poetry
contest. and the generous
helping of Jines allows us to
be more generous towards
his contribution before we
are through. In his first
two poems “Lying Down

guage.

In the others though we
sense the excitement of the
unexpected: “‘around the cor-
ner/is a crocodile/ smo
ing a cigar’; the emergence

of the warrior in “Swan
Mountain’; and the antic
disposition of ‘‘Rabbits.”

Here the logic of fantasy is
at work.

The. contribution of Ken
Rice offers more variety and
lyrical range than any other
five poems in the volume.
In “Rafferty’s prayer’ there
is this directness of address:

In “No Contrast” there 13
an indirectness which. gives
the poem quite a different
tonal key. Along with its
photographic play of light
and line there is an obtique-
ness. in the vision of the
speaker coming from the pre-

cise use of certain verbals
and syntactical subordin’-
tion,

In “The. Baptist’’ there 1s
still another kind of verbal
action: “He struck. . He
tested. . . Pushed. . And
brought them back. ... Here
‘the thrust of the syntax helps
enlarge this character to pro-
phetic size.

in poetry is notable for the
virtuosity we have come to
expect from him.. although
the. particular virtues of the
present. poems are. more

powerfully at work -in last 7

‘year’s “Miscellany’’ (in for
éxample ‘Byrd's Eden'*) and
in those that won this. years
first prize in the Vereen Bell
competition. Here the tradi-
tional verse forms ‘harness
certain resources of the lan-
guage and the voice works
back and forth and with and
against regular meter. Per-
haps in the pieces before us
now we sense the comforts
of meter without all of the
expected power.

The principle of represent-
ing each poet's idiom amply
which aided an appreciation
of Peter Wild should have
been followed in the cases
of J. S. Winkler and N.
Ramachandran.

After one good poem by
each we want to see several
more of the sobering comedy
of the last stanza of ‘In the
Summer Colony’’ and more
of the encantation of ‘Agony
and Relief.’ In the latter
the repetition of phrases jn
more than a merely repre-
sentational fashion becomes a
ritual of language that opens
the inner spaces, and more
of this would have helped us
see how repetition and in
version can push words to
wards dream in this desert
seascape.

ing poem by Mark Roh‘nson
