By Sean Lind

On Sunday, February 1, a
pledge of the Sigma Phi Epsilon
fraternity was injured during an
attempted “road trip.”

In the incident, freshman
Alfredo Urbino, an international
student from Venezuela, received
a laceration to the back of his head.
Urbino was treated at a local hos-
pital and released.

The Dean of Students Office
has suspended all pledging and
social activities at SPE until fur-
ther notice.

Committee
Proposes

Changes to
Alcohol
Policy

By Mandy Curtis

The current alcohol policy on
campus underwent revision by the
SGA Ad-Hoc Alcohol Policy Com-
mittee and changes have been pro-
posed. After reviewing the effects
of the policy from the start of the
1992-93 academic year, the SGA
Ad-Hoc committee found positive
and negative results and made rec-
ommendations to be approved by
the Dean of Students and the Trust-
ees of the college.

According to the committee,
headed by juniorChrisEdmonston,
there are two main failings of the
alcohol policy. The first is its
inability to create an atmosphere
of responsible drinking as it had
been hoped to achieve. The sec-
ond failing is its ability to create an
“Us vs. Them” attitude on campus
between the students and the moni-
tors, police officers, and adminis-
tration.

The negative results observed
by the committee in the report in-
clude overall student discontent
with the “dense, muddled, andcon-
fusing” policy thathas caused con-
fusion for the students. Another
negative result of the policy is the
one cup “rule” which has consis-
tently frustrated those students of
the legal drinking age. The third
negative resultreported by thecom-
mittee is the weekday party regu-
lation which has “altered the social
atmosphere at Davidson.”

According to Edmonston, the
weekday party restriction is the
aspect of the alcohol policy con-
sistently complained about by men,

said that the Dean's office has also
set up a Review Committee to de-
termine “the culpability of the fra-
ternity as an organization in this
event.”
According to the police re-
port, at approximately 4:20 pm,
Urbino was summoned to a SPE

fraternity brother’s Belk dorm:

room on the pretense of vacuum-
ing the carpet.

. Shortly thereafter, seven SPE
fraternity brothers entered the
room, wrestled Urbino to the floor,
and bound his hands and feet with
duct tape. Several brothers then

carried Urbino down the stairs, out
of Belk, and into the laundry park-
ing lot, intending to put him into a
waiting car and “road trip” him.

At this time, two SPE pledges
witnessed what was happening and
pursued the brothers, attempting
to rescue Urbino. In the struggle,
the brother or brothers carrying
Urbino lost hold of him, and he fell
headfirst onto the asphalt surface
of the parking lot.

Because he was bound, Urbino
was unable to break his fall and
landed on his left shoulder and the
left side and rear of his head. He

included committee meetings, re-
ports, a reception with students,
and dinner at faculty homes.

The plennary session was held

tees reported tothe board. Admis-

sionsand Financial Aid announced

Patterson Court Advisor Kurt
Holmes said that as of yetthe Dean
of Students Office is dealing with

to “road trip” Urbino have been.
issued a summons by the Dean of

charged witha violation of Section
IV, paragraph 1 of the Code of

Off in Charlotte

Area Seen as "Centerpiece"
of the $150 Million Campaign

By Chris Hood
and College Relations

Approximately 900 Charlotte-
areca alumni gathered at the First
Union Atrium and North Carolina
Blumenthal Performing Arts Cen-
ter last Wednesday evening as the
College officially opened its Re-
gional Campaign for Davidson in
Charlotte.

The program, hosted by Char-
lotte Campaign co-chairpeople
Thomas M. Belk ’46 and Katherine
M. Belk, included speeches by

President John Kuykendall ’59, |

former Governor James Martin ’57
and Charlotte Mayor Richard
Vinroot. The Charlotte Symphony
Orchestra entertained the crowd
and included an impressive solo

New York Philharmonic’s Princi-
pal Oboist.

First Union Chairman Edward

E. Crutchfield, Jr. °63, who is also ©

Campaign Corporate Gifts Chair-
man, helped organize the location
for the program and gala. R. Stuart
Dickson II ’51, Chairman of the
Institutional Advancement Com-
mittee for the Board of Trustees,

served as emcee.

The Campaign for Davidson
began in November of 1989. ‘The
Campaign’s goal is $150 million
by June 1995, and over $110 mil-
lion has already been recorded.
$20.6 million of that came in the
1992 calendar year, a figure that
puts the campaign on targetto mect
its Ovcrall goal by 1995. In Char-
lotte alone, Campaign organizers
expect to raise at Icast $9 million
more, to bring the arca’s total con-
tribution to $30 million.

“T consider this thecenterpicce
of the Campaign,” said Davidson’s
Director of Regional Campaigns,
Gracia Slater. “We feel like we’re
right on target, in spite of a diffi-
cult economic climate.”

The institutional advancement
staff has lined up 75 Charlotte vol-
unteers who will follow this gala
by each contacting five people
aboutmaking pledges to Davidson.
Last Tuesday the college also paid
for an eight-page special insert in
the Charlotte Observer which pro-
filed 15 Davidson alumni who are
