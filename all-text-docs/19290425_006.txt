. NOTED FRENCHMAN
TO LECTURE HERE

Professor Rene WHardre who is
brought to Davidson under the spon-
sorship of ;,Le Cercle Francaise is to
speak to the students and faculty of
Davidson College on Wednesday night,
April 24. He is French instructor at the
North Carolina College for Women
at Greensboro. The subject on which
M. Hardre will speak in French is“Les
de France”.

Last year, M. Hardre, speaking in
French, told of his life as a schoolboy
in France in a very amusing and pleas-
ing way. According to those who had
the opportunity of hearing him last
year, Prof. Hardre is a man of very
charming personality and made a very
interesting talk. Also he brought
with him a number of brilliantly col-_
ored pictures of France, among them
were scenes of especial interest such
as pictures of Brittany, Lorraine, Mon-
te Carlo, and other places.

France is the native country of M.
Hardre and it is only recently that
he has come to America to take over
the chair of French at N. C. C. W.
Last year he expressed himself as en-
joying his visit to Davidson very much
and a large number of students are
expected to hear his lecture Wednes-
day night.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

Dr. Blakely Speaks
To Ministerial Band

The Ministerial Band has always been
glad to welcome as speakers at the Sun-
day afternoon meetings those distin-
guished guests who may be at the college
at that particular time. On last Sunday
afternoon the speaker was Dr. Hunter
Blakely of Columbia Seminary who had
come to Davidson to speak at the “Y”
vespers. Doctor Blakely said that he
wished to talk about the misistry as a
life’s. work and not to. present a-formal
address.

What the ministry needs is not more
men but better then. If the men in the
ministry were the best men available who
had given themselves to work and pre-
paration, they could turn the world up-
| side-down in a short while. More men
are needed who will go all of.the way
in preparation and this is no easy job.
The modern world offers a challenge
to ministers to seek the best preparation.
Time was when the minister was the best
educated man in the town but that day
has passed. In every congregation there
are men who are as well educated if not
better than the minister. Therefore the
minister’s range of knowledge cannot be
too great. In his own experience, Doctor
Blakely said that when he started preach-
ing he gave out of sermon material in a
very few weeks. and he’ had’ to buckle
down to preach to the same congregation
three times a week.

The minister has a closer contact with
people probably than even the physician.
There are the -young as well as the old
and the minister should have such~Christ-
like grace as to make the little children
come to him and in so doing be able to
mould their lives into upright Christian

I
€
I

This is an age in Which men are trying | ;

doubt the fundamentals of faith. But even
so, if it is a fine thing to preach in an ;
is to preach in a time of doubt. It is the
minister's job to lead others to the right I
way. ;

Prior to the meeting the election of t

officers was held for the next term. The
following were elected: F. D. Miller,
President; Albert McClure, Vice-presi-
dent; and R. Prince, Secretary. These
men will be installed at the next meeting.
They succeed T. E. Hill, president; Alex.
Warren, Vice-president; and M. W. Nor-
fleet, Secretary-treasurer.

TENNESSEE CLUB HOLDS

YEAR’S LAST FEED

Rule, Close and Regan on
Program

An atmosphere of sadness prevailed: in

Eu Hall Wedhesday night as the Ten-

nessee Club met for the last time in the

year. The members seemed to be quite

lejected over the fact that they would
lever again meet with the senior members

of the Club from Tennessee.

This atmosphere of sadness lasted from

9:00 p. m, to 9:10—then the eats were
served,

Following the program featured by

lrinks, fruits, creams, sandwiches, tobac-

co, of all varieties, concocted by C. N.
Burch, a second program was prepared

»y Spencer McCallie. The chief feature
m this program was Mr. Rule’s recita-
ion of the time Casey didn’t get to first.

This was, followed by a pantomime in
which Ed Close ‘demonstrated on Sporty

legen (president, what happens in pic-
ure show galleries in Chattanooga( and

they didn’t eat peanuts).

The meeting broke up after the seniors

failed to get exemption from dues for

he night.
The meeting was on the verge of fail-

ure—Joe Gardner wasn't there.

In the style of Jack Horner,

It was his smile.

Tourist—I clearly had the right of

yet you say that I was to blame.
Cop—You certainly were.
Tourist—Why?

Cop—Because his father is mayor,
his brother is chief of police, and I

Bent But Not Yet Broke
If you had five dollars in your pock-
et what would you do?
Broken—I'd think I had somebody
else’s pants on.

Hey! Don’t spit on the tloor!
What-sa matter—Floor leak?

Upon the asylum roof a few repairs
were being carried out by a local build-
er who had asked for one of the in-
timates to assist him in alittle job.

All went well until lunch time, when,
as the clock struck one, the builder’s
assistant clutched him round the neck
and giving a terrible laugh, said:

“Come on, let’s jump off.”

The builder was frightened out of
his. life, but suddenly he had an in-
spiration.

“Oh rats,” he replied. “Aybody could
do that. Come down and let's jump

up.

Watermark
Dear Old Lady—Captain, would you
please help me find my stateroom?
Captain—Have you forgotten what
number it is?

D. O. L.—Yes, but I'll know it if
I see it again, because there was a
lighthouse just outside the window.

Again we have the one about a
Scotchman who was invited to a party
and told that each guest was t boring
something. He brought his relatives.

Oh!

What are these tickets I found in
my husband’s pocket?

Your husband is an  archaelogist.
These tickets are evidences of a lost
race. 0

All that is human must retrograde
if it does not advance.
