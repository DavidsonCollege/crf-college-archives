special attention One of these is
in the area of the sciences
where there is a definite need
for more space and new equip-
ment. especially in the
Chemistry department

“If we are to maintain a com-
petitive edge in getting our
students into medical schools.
we must have the best pre-med
facilities to go along with good
professors. he said

Cornell said that renovations
of the Chemistry building alone
would be in the neighborhood of
three-quarters of a million
dollars

Uther topics the committee
will deal with are the need tor
more space for the Fine Arts
Department. the kind of Student
Union that the college should
have. and other possible
renovations of various parts of
the campus

Cornell emphasized that one
of the most significant gover-
ning factors will be the amount
of money that will be available
to be spent. At present. no
predictions on the size of this
sum can be made

He also said that his com-
mittee would have to wait to
make any final decisions until
two very important inputs were
received.

These are a decision by the ad
hoc committee on housing
headed by Dean of Students Will
H. Terry as to the type and
location of future student
housing. and Director of the
Union C. Shaw Smith's idea of
what the new Union should be
like.

While no target date has been
set for the BBG's decision. Cor-
nell said that as soon as any
decisions were made. they
would be presented to Spencer

He reminded the audrence
that nothing was said when
black children were = once
bused to attain segregation.
Only since white students have
been bussed lengthy distances
to accomplish desegregation

has discussion erupted con-
cerning busing
Concerning weltare. Rowan

stated that President Nixon had
vetoed a public works bill at the
same time he was encouraging
puritan work ethics

On the subject of quotas,
Rowan said that there will be no
change in the number of Blacks
occupying better business and
government positions until
there is more pressure.

“The American people are
going to swallow all the
malarky about busing. welfare.
and quotas. he predicted. ‘Mr.
Nixon has been one of the
shrewdest presidents to occupy
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue."

Rowan added that °“'Mr.
Nixon has been shrewd at sen-

sing the frustations of the
people.
Wednesday night Rowan

spoke on “The Fall Elections
and America’s Future: Are We
Moving to the Right?” His
Thursday morning lecture was
entitled ‘The Racial Factor in
Presidential Politics.”

Rowan. a former director ot
the U.S. Information Agency
and winner of more than a
dozen journalism awards, was
deputy assistant secretary of
State for public aftairs in 1961
1963 and U.S) Ambassador to
Finland in 1963-64
