Wildcats win conference opener

Women’s soccer splits two, yet sits atop the Southern conference standings after win at GSU

Remley’s Point, S.C. - After
seven games the women’s soccer
team (3-4, 1-0 in the Southern) has
mustered only eight goals.

“It’s very frustrating to be at
this point in the season without a
goal-scorer having emerged,”
coach Kevin Hundley said. “We
need someone we can count on
who we get the ball to in the box
and they score.”

In an attempt to create more
offense, Amy Balsinger was moved
from sweeper into the midfield last
week. The team is 2-2, having
scored five goals since the move.

- “(Not scoring much) means
we can’ tafford defensive mistakes.
This is not a blaming situation, but
we’ ve gotta do, what we’ ve gotta
do,” Hundley continued.

Despite the relative lack of
offense, the Wildcats did what they
needed to on Saturday, taking an
important 2-1 conference victory
at Georgia Southern.

GSU was ranked second be-
hind Davidson in the pre-season
conference polls, followed by
Furman. Now, both the Eagles and
the Paladins have one loss, while
Davidson is tied with App. St. atop
the conference standings.

Angie Boyer struck first for
the Wildcats, pushing them on top
in the 30th minute when she
knocked in the rebound from a

corner kick. The Eagles tied the-

score with under ten seconds to
play in the half.

“It was a great job by the subs
in the first half. It was a pretty even
game for the first 20 to 25 minutes,
but then we brought in the subs and
took over. We were pretty unlucky
not to be up two or three (at the
break),” coach Kevin Hundley said.

Ginny Dye knocked in her
third goal and her second game-
winner (both tops on the team) in

the 60th minute.’

However, an inability to fin-
ish doomed the Wildcats on Sun-
day against the College of Charles-
ton (5-4).

Davidson outshot the Cougars
16 to 7 for the game, and con-
trolled play from the opening
minute. However, Charleston fin-
ished two first half goals and were
able to hold off a furious Wildcat
rally to win 2-1.

“It’s pretty disappointing,”
Hundley said. “It felt more like 60-
7 (the number of shots), and I felt

, like they were quality chances. But

when you don’t finish you don’t
win.”

Terry Marino put the first
Cougar goal away in the 28th
minute. Charleston’ added one
more in the 40th minute on a
counter-attack. Davidson was pres-
suring, but Charleston cleared the
ball down field where it was col-
lected at mid-field by Carly
Rounds, She carried it to the touch-

Outside midfielder Kelly Ammann sends a pass across the field during drill work in pract eo

line then hit a back-post cross to
Alison McCurry who headed it
past goalkeeper Allison Noznesky.

Kelly Ammann pulled the
Wildcats within one, when she
knocked a rebound past Cougar
goalkeeper Nikki Davis. Ginny
Dye’s shotmoments before slipped

past Davis, knocked off the post to
Ammann’s feet, and she put it
away.

But, Davis (11 saves) didn’t
let another shot by.

“I thought we’d scored early
enough to come back,” Hundley
said. “But yesterday we started 1-

0 in conference, we'll focus on
that. Our overall record won’t be
as good because we’ ve lost to two.
opponents we should have beaten:
(College of Charleston and
Wofford), but we'll take today’s.
loss outon App. St. on Wednesday .
and go up 2-0 in the conference.”
