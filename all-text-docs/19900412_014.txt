Women's Tennis
Comes Together

By JULIE BREWER

The women’s tennis team, cur-
rently 12-12 with three matches re-
maining, hopes to finish with its 16th
consecutive winning season. Junior
Mary Beth Ruth commented, “I am
very positive about our chances for a
winning season if we concentrate on
each match as individuals and as a
team.”

Last year, six seniors graduated,
including five of the top six singles
players,so the team is young and many
of the players are gaining needed
experience with every match. Said
coach Caroline Price, “With five new
names in the lineup, it is a real tribute
to the ‘89-’90 team to be 12-12 with
the schedule before them.”

In addition to inexperience, the
team has been forced to overcome a
host of injuries and illnesses, includ-
ing one that has permanently sidelined
senior co-captain Debbie DeCou.
DeCou, who played from edrly Febru-
ary through Spring Break with astress
fracture of the femur, will now fill the
tole of assistant coach. “I am really
disappointed about not being able to
play, but I am glad to be assistant
coach. At least something good did
come out of it,” DeCou said.

During Spring Break, the team
jourmeyed to Hilton Head Island, S.C.,

and used the week of concentrated
tennis to gain a strong sense of focus
and to set goals for the rest of the
season. “Spring Break was a time for
intense tennis with no distractions, in
which everyone could give their all,”
said Price.

The team finished Spring Break
with a 34 record, after defeating
Coastal Carolina, Virginia Common-
wealth and Haverford, and falling to
Southern Illinois, College of Char-

leston, Georgetown and Berry. DeCou .

felt that it was a great trip with lots of
tough tennis and tough matches.

Price explained that, during the
week at Hilton Head, the team was
able to benefit from the intangible
things that can’t always be worked on
in the regular season. Said freshman
May Martin, “We grew closer as a
team by getting the chance to know
each other off the court as well as on
[it).”

Price’s overall feeling about the
team and its potential for the future is
a positive one: “The talent level com-
ing in this year is the best in my nine
years of coaching here, even though
we dropped three matches that I had
not anticipated [losing]. Many of the
mistakes are due to inexperience.”

Now entering the final two weeks
of the season, the players will have to
utilize skills they have learned all year
to beat High Point, UNC-Greensboro
and Guilford.

Track Cats Perform Well, Beach
Lowers Record Again and Again

By JAY CLUGSTON

The Men’s and Women’s Track
teams continued their successful sea-
sons at the March 30-31 Battleground
Relays - Mary Washington College,
Fredericksburg, Virginia, and at last
weekend’s Emory Invitational, Emory
University, Atlanta, Georgia. The
men’s team has been led by it’s dis-
tance crew at both meets, and the
women have had especially strong
performances from Kathy Beach and
Heather Tarpley.

The Battleground Relays provided
the men and women with cold tem-
peratures, rain, and competition from
schools of the Virginia-Maryland-
Pennsylvania area. 10,000 metermen,
David Murray (32:35.2) and Chris
Otrok (33:05.1) bothhad personal bests
placing 4th and 7th in their Friday
afternoon race. This was senior David
Murray’s first 10,000 meters and his
time ranks as Davidson’s third fastest
in history.

Coach Gary Andrew was glad
Murray finally got the chance to race
this distance. “The 5,000 meter is just
tooshort for David. Heneeds the extra
length of the 10,000 meter. It was an
outstanding performance, especially
forhis first time.” In the 5,000 meter,
freshman Ian Stewart won his heat in
16:02.1, and was followed closely by

freshman David Kerns’ 16:08.7.
Recording personal bests in the 1,500
meter were senior Jay Clugston, 7th
place in 4:08.1, and freshman Ben
Wiley in4:17.2. Freshman Dan Franks
paced the distance medley relay team
(11:04) with a 53.9 400m leg. Senior
Robbie “Sage” Mckay (3:27.4 1200m),
Wiley (2:05.7 800m), and Clugston
(4:37.9 1600m) all ran strong legs of
this relay, despite only one and a half
hours recovery from their 1500m races.

Wiley alsoran aseason’s best 54.5leg—

in the 1600m relay (3:42.0), and then
passed the baton to distance runner,
Peter Hurtado, who ended the relay
with a strong 53.3 split.

At Emory, the Wildcats faced
twenty Southeastern teams. The men
were lead by 5th place finishes from
freshman, David Kerns in the 3,000
meter steeplechase (10:01.68) and
freshman Peter Hurtado in the 800
meters (1:58.05). “Chris Otrok
(15:45.80) and David Murray
(15:46.30) ran the two fastest 5,000
meter times in recent Davidson. his-
tory as they paced each otherto7th and
8th place finishes, and the 1,600 meter
relay team used quick relay legs from’
Jay Clugston (55.2) and Peter Hurtado
(52.4) to improve its season’s best
time to 3:41.04.

Kathy Beach was the high scorer
for the women at the Battleground
Relays with first place finishes in both
the 1500, and 3000 meters.. Her 1,500

meter time of 4:48.9 smashed her pre-
vious school record (4:53) set two
weeks ago at the University of Miami.
Her second race of the meet was the
3,000 meter which she lead from start
to finish (10:34.3). This was the first
1,500-3,000 meter double Beach has
attempted and Coach Andrew feels
she gave a super performance. Multi-
talented, freshman Heather “Zip”
Tarpley placed 6th in thediscus (99’9"),
and 7th in both the 100 meter and 400
‘meter hurdles (17,7 and 70.4). Retum- zi
ing toherhometown of Fredericksburg,
VA, freshman Jennifer Brown placed
6th in her first ever 1500 meter with a
time of 5:08.2.

Beach again highlighted the
women’s performances at Emory with
another 1,500 meter school record of
4:45.7 (4th place). She came back an
hour and a half later to run a personal
best in the 800 meters with a time of
2:24.35 (Sth place). Heather Tarpley
placed Sth in the discus with her sea-
son’s best throw of 106’2", 6th in the
400m hurdles (69.75), and 8th in the
100 meter hurdles (16.99). Freshmen
Deidra Montague surpassed her sea-
son’s best effort in the shot put with a
put of 35°6.75", and Jennifer Brown
improved her 800 meters to 2:26.55.

Both teams travel to ‘Durham,
North Carolina, this weekend to com-
pete in their largest meet of the year,
the Duke Invitational, where 30,000
spectators are expected.
