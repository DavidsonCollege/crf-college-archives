to be that President Bush has pre-

without first giving the U.N. im-

work, with the effect that the pro-
posed war in the gulf becomes a
self-fulfilling prophecy. Heaven

prepare for a war that has been a

Listen up you slack-jawed
troglodytes and take a look at the
big picture. On January 9th, while
Tariq Aziz and James Baker were
pursuing “the last best chance for
peace,” the Saddamite was sug-
gesting that American soldiers
would “swim in their own blood”
in the event of a war. Such state-
ments don’ t generally garner Nobel
Peace prizes. In fact, Mother
Theresa, who did win a Nobel
Peace Prize, wrote a letter to both
President Bush and Saddam
Hussein suggesting that “if you

Could Accessible Student Evaluations Of
Professors &Classes Improve Academic Life?

As a freshman I had no idea
what I was doing. I had some
vague ideas about being a doctor,
liked English more than science in
high school, could read and write,
things like that. I assume that at
least a few people were like me.
Nowadays I sort of know what I
am doing, but not because of any
advice I got from my freshman
advisor. What I know I learned

more by making my own mistakes’

than by being informed.

My fault, you might say. My
failure to deal with-my problems.
Maybe so, but part of learning is
connecting people with informa-
tion. All kinds of people with all
kinds of information. You can’t
gather information forever and
never doanything. Hamlet’s prob-
lem, soft of. You are ultimately
responsible for your own decisions.
Yetif one makes uninformed deci-
sions based upon incomplete in-
formation. you hurt yourself more.
This is obvious.

Over Christmas, relatives
asked me “What are you doing?” I
hate that question. Usually be-

smile a bit and talk more bull.
Many seniors I talk.to are faced
with the factthat they need to know
what they are doing next year.
Some are really sure, some have
ideas, some have no clue. It’s fine
not to be certain of course, but it
seems to me that paying all this
money to study subjects that we
won’ tever apply in a practical way
is foolish. College is a time to find
yourself and all of that but why pay
$15,000 a year to. do it? ~
Sosomething needs tobe done,
perhaps. I should probably write
about what is wrong with the advi-

sor system, and at least offer sug-

gestions on how to change it.
Maybe next time. I’d rather sug-

magazine Consumer Reports. It
tests andevaluates consumer goods
like cars, VCRs, CD-players andis
an accurate measure of factors like
durability and overall quality.

the Professor? Is he sexist, boring,
a genius, an easy D?

Yet this is dangerous. After
all, evaluating a professor is much
more complicated than testing a
television set for durability. Our
existing system is confidential and
private. Public record is a new
ballgame. According to several
faculty members, Davidson had a
public record of evaluation in the
early seventies. The old system
combined numerical ratings and
actual comments from students. In
some years, depending on the
quality of the staff, the publication
was helpful to students but in other
years-it became a popularity poll
and was almost libelous. Would
the present student body produce
anything different?

The case against a public rec-
ord of teacher evaluations is strong.
It can jeopardize the quality of
academics if students are influ-
enced by the wrong factors. On
one extreme, the student who only

Bummer

By Matt Wazenburg '93

Call ita freshman hangover if
you will, but at random moments
I believe it is possible to navigate
through most of the bureaucratic
spaghetti at Davidson. Ihave lived
off-campus at Davidson for four
months and was beginning to be-
lieve that] could handleakitchen,
independence and the quiet of
my Own quarters. Well, the sub-
urban fantasy has shrunk like
some raisin and I find myself
pining for the halls of Belk and
Akers. This is not how a sopho-
more should be expected to live.
Though they remain tucked away
well off campus, many sopho-
mores do. Living off-campus is
not for everyone; but Davidson is
forcing students to swallow this
bitter pill.

I am quite aware that it is the
rare case when a student is per-
fectly happy with his or her hous-
ing: two “smiley marks” for
everyone who is satisfied. Yet
this is not the point of my argu-
ment. It appears to. me that
Davidson is growing too big for
its old clothes. Trying to argue
that Davidson should not grow is
foolish: it's going to happen and
the students at Davidson willreap
the rewards and pay the prices.

What Davidson needs is a~

The Off-Campus

in Davidson, there would still be
great need for a service to help
students live in’any off-campus
rooms that become available.

This is notan appeal to change
the lottery system, to initiate a
coup in the admissions office, or
for Davidson to pay for off-cam- |
pus housing. I love Davidson. I
have never been happier with my
classes and my education. But
frankly, I feel left in the shadows.
And I feel we all need to ask some
questions about Davidson’s
growth if every year more stu-
dents are to be moved off-cam-
pus.

I am aware that Residence
Life is not to be blamed. Richard
Terry in RL has gone the extra
mile in order to situate my room-
mate and me. He is working with
all the resources Davidson has at
its command.

I cannot blame Admossions;
as aforementioned,. I expect
Davidson to be just a little less
than 1800 students before I gradu-
ate. Perhaps what remains so frus-
trationg about the situation is that
no one can answer why we do.not
have as ‘many beds as students.

“Nonetheless, I do notseekascape-

goat; I seek a bed to sleep in next
