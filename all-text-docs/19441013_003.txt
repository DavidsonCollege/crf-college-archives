CAT TAL

By JOE STUKES

It looks as though the only sport to be enjoyed around
the campus in the next ccuple of weeks will be yelling at
the freshmen. The football team has knocked off for
three weeks after their tie with Woodberry Saturday.
There are hopes of a game with Porter, but it seems that
this is mostly just wishful thinking.

CATS TIE TIGERS
Here’s an old one with a new twist: the Davidson
Wildkittens served ‘T’ to Woodberry Forest in Orange,
Va. last Saturday. The majority of Davidsonians were
pleased to hear the score. Although outweighed 15 to
20 pounds per man, the seven Wildkittens played the
Tiger forward wall to a standstill in the first quarter
and the eleven from Davidson pushed their opponents
around the last half. Many people guessed the method
of scoring when the final count was heard. It seems
that Quarterback Edwards threw a strike to End Pell
in the end zone for our tally. It was a fine showing
for the first game and we expect the Wildkittens to
_ wipe up the field with the rest of the schedule.
PELL AND HAGAN LOST
We hate to see Allison Pell and ‘Terry Hagan leave
Davidson this week. They both turned in great games last
Saturday and the team will feel their loss. Coach Hudson
is shifting the whole team around. Maybe he’ll find the
right answer.
SERIES
Cardinals 3, Browns 1, said the man at the mike on
Monday. This sixth game told the tale at Saint Louis
and closed the books on the first all-Saint Louis series
in all history. It has to happen sometime. The Cards
had four games to the Brownies’ two as Frosh Ted
Wilks got the last man in the ninth. It was a very
exciting series. Pitching stood’out as great through-
out the entire fracas, reaching a climax in the fifth
game when Denny Galehouse and Mort Cooper com-
bined to whif 22 men for a new record. Cooper drew
endless cheers as he fanned three pinch-hitters. The
announcer said that Musial was the first Card player
to make an error. What do they do in a Series, play
poker? Our least invaluable players are Marty Marion
and George McQuinn.

FRAT FOOTBALL

Pete Sinclair’s dissonant booming ushered in frat
football after a delay of two days because of lack of time.
Whittle:muttered something about “C’est la guerre’’ but
I don’t understand French. The KA-Kappa Sig team de-
feated the SPE’s two first downs to one. The Pi Kaps,
led by Disputations Pete, took the Pikas 12-0.
defeated the Independents 6-0. And the KA-Kappa Sigs
have taken the Pikas 36-0, Looks like the Betas and the
KA-Kappa Sigs.

We'll pick Notre Dame, Army, and the Gremlins
this week. You pick the rest.

Gets Started

KA-Kappa Sigs and Betas
Take Lead in First Games

Touch football got off to a good
start last week as the Kappa Sigs
and K. A.’s combined to edge out
the Sig Eps by a margin of two first
downs to one. There was no score
as the game was highly contested
throughout. Lowry led the combine,
while McBride and Owens directed
the SPE's.

The Pi Kaps under Pete Sinclair
next won over the Pikas managed

by Bob Hossman in a 12-0 defeat.

In the third game the Betas were
victorious over a hard fighting in-
dependent team with a score of 6-0.

In the last game to date the KA

strong as they banged out a 30-0

Cats Hold Their Own Against
a Heavier Team With a
Score of 6-6

On Friday morning, October 6,
the 1944 version of the Davidson
Wildkittens traveled to Orange,
Va., for thesopening football game
of the season against Woodberry
Forest.vAs this was the first game
of the season, nothing much was
known about their’ strength. How-
ever, when the game was completed
Saturday afternoon, everyone. was
ready to say that Davidson has again
fielded an eleven that carried with
it the good sportsmanship and fight
ing spirit which has been character
istic of all Davidson teams in the
past.

The team arrived at Woodberry
Forest late Friday afternoon, and
immediately donned equipment. for
a short workout and some loosening
up After the workout,
they went into Orange for dinner,
and then came back to the school
to get a good night's sleep before
the game.

exercises,

at 2:30° Saturday, the
game had a rousing beginning when
Davidson, fullback for Woodberry,
ran the openig kickoff back to
Davidson's 35 yard line. Woodberry
tried several line plays that failed
to produce a first down, and kicked
out of a hole, and then: the Wild-
kittens started However,
it was not’ until late the
period. that they were able to hit
pay-dirt. The score came on a pass
from Edwards to Pell,: and netted
the first six points of the game.
The try for the extra point failed,
and at the end of the first) period
the score was Davidson 6 to Wood
berry 0. During the second period,
both teams fought on even terms,
neither being able to cross the dou
ble stripe.

Cats Lose

Davidson Loses Two Valuable
First String Players

Our frosh team has been badly
damaged by the loss of two valuable
players, Allison Pell and Terry
Hagan. Both of these* boys have
gone into a bigger game which js
played for keeps. 5
- Allison Pell played end for the
Wildcats and was an excellent man
both offensively and defensively. He
was well known in scrimmage for
his hard tackling and blocking, and
especially for being able to catch
anything anywhere near him. It
was Pell who ‘snagged Phil Ed-
wards’ pass for. the Wildcats lone
score against Woodberry Forest.
Pell was captain of the Darlington
team last year and it is too bad
that he won't be able to play against
them when Davidson meets them in
Rome, Georgia, on he 24th of next
month,

Terry Hagan playing wingback
on offense and safety on defense is
also a fitst string player, Although
very light, Terry was noted for shif-
ty running and hard driving. Both
boys will be sorely missed, and
leave places that will be hard to fill.

So far as is known at this time
no game has been scheduled for
this weekend, -It was hoped that
there might be a home game, but
we are all looking forward to one
in a few weeks.
