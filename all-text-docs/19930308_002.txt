District Attorney Addresses Rape in North Carolina

By Alice Felmlee

Rape, a sexual assault com-
mitted without willing consent, is
acrime common toall areas of the
world. Amidstrecentrumors of an
attempted rape on campus,
Davidson too addressed this con-
cem. —
Speaking to-a predominantly
female audience on the night of
Tuesday March 2, Richard Gor-
don spoke on rape and how it is
treated under North Carolina law.
Gordon, a district attorney in Char-
lotte, spoke not only for the law;
but also as a father. His daughter,
Kathleen, is a junior at Davidson.

Initially, Gordon sought to .

shed light on the differences be-
tween firstand second degree rape.
While first degree rape involves
forced consent by use of a deadly
weapon and carries a mandatory
sentence of life in prison, those
convicted of second degree rape in
North Carolina may face anywhere
from twenty to forty yearsin prison.
These punishments are not
common to North Carolina alone,
however. “Everywhere from
Michigan to North Carolina has
similar laws concerning rape,”
Gordon commented.
“Unfortunately, for those in-

volved, rape is often only one of

- several crimes present within the

same transaction,” Gordon contin-
ued. Itisnot uncommon for rape to
be preceded by a kidnapping or a
first degree burglary. In such situ-
ations the penalty becomes more
severe and in the case that the
victim is killed it may eventually
lead to death row.

As a district attomey Gordon
commented on rape as it is seen in
the court room as well. ““Mostrape
defendants do not plead guilty be-
cause they cannotbring themselves
to admit that they did it.”

. Onceinthecourtroom itseems

that ““consentcases,” ones in which
the defendant claims the victim
consented, are the most difficult to
obtain a conviction for.
Inallrapecases there are defi-
nite waysin which to prove guiltor
innocence, however. “DNA test-
ing isour mostpowerful tool,” said
Gordon. This irrefutable proof
combined with fingerprintsamples
and eye-witness identification of-
ten make their way into the court
room.
When creating a hypothetical
rape on the Davidson campus Gor-
don instructed his audience on what
steps should be taken to help the

victim in the long run.

“It would be‘best to call the
Mecklenburg Police in addition to
the Davidson police in the event of
a rape,” he commented. “While
Davidson has trained investigators
they can’t do it all.”

In his closing Gordon aban-
doned his role as district attorney
and assuméd a more fatherly role.
“Most people talk of violent crime
like they talk of the other side of
the moon but you must remember
that crime is out there,” he said:
“There are some bad, bad people in
this world and I pray that you don’t
meet some of the one’s I’ve met.”

Davidson Alum Speaks on Identity Politics

_ By Jeff Oller

. In analyzing the present state
of democracy worldwide, Eliza-
beth Kiss examined the role of
fragmentation. She considered
whether or not movements such as
the ciyil rights or women's move-
ments are a detriment to democ-
racy.

1983 was a year of firsts for
Elizabeth Kiss. In that year she
became the only female Rhodes
Scholar in the history of Davidson,
an achievement whichremains un-
matched even today.

While at Davidson, Kiss was
instrumental in starting the
Davidson branches of Amnesty
International and the Women’s Is-
sues Committee. Today she has

New Track, Soccer Venues Very Likely

other purposes such as the endow-
ment and professorships.

The importance of the track
program at Davidson goes beyond
the students who are members of
the track team, however. The track
program here is very important to
the entire school not only because
it is a traditional part of Davidson
athletics, but also because of
NCAA requirements for Division
I athletics.

“In order to be a Division I
athletic program, we have to have
seven sanctioned sports for men
and for women. If we lost any one
sport for women right now we
would not qualify. Two of ours
right now are cross country and
outdoor track,” said Lee Sargent.

If Davidson lost Division I
Status in athletics, none of what
happened in December for the soc-
cer team would be possible. With
the loss of Division I status, would
come the loss of athletic scholar-
ships, a vastly reduced budget, and

limited post-season tournament

play.

Thus far, the only firm deci-
sion that has been made is that a
new facility is necessary.

No site has been decided on;

though two are being considered.
One possibility is locating the track
and soccer fieldon the upper IMAC
fields. It would make.a good site
because it is a very compact, level
surface, and also would be a good
location forthe youth soccer camps
which come here in the summer,
Another possibility would be
torenovate Richardson Field. This
is not as easy as it might seem,
because to build the kind of track
facility which would really im-

' prove the track program, an eight-

lane track is necessary. To build
an eight-lane track around a soccer
field would mean that the entire
east stadium would have to be re-
moved. Also, since the mainte-
nance departments housed under-
neath, it would have to be moved
also.

Clearly there are benefits to
having the complex at Richardson
Field, however. For sentimental
reasons, it is the best site since it is
the A.H. Whittle track, named af-
ter Coach Whittle, who was the
Davidson track coach for 42 years.
Also, keeping it there would tie
Baker Sports Complex in with the
rest of the campus better than the
upper IMAC fields.

One problem with putting the
complex on Richardson Field is

that ground could not be broken
until the NCAA soccer tourna-
ments were no longer at Davidson.
In other words, there would be no
new track for at least two to four
years. Because the athletics de-
partment does not wish to see its
track program dwindle as a result
of the tournament, some are pro-
posing a temporary track be built.

According to Director of Ath-
letics Terry Holland, “There is the
possibility of a $50,000-$60,000
temporary track, but if we do that it
will be 7 or 8 years before a new
track and soccer facility is built.”

A final decision will be made
by the Facilities Planning Com-
mittee, which advises the Presi-
dent. The track complex:is only
one of their responsibilities how-
ever, as they attempt to plan how
the college is set up for decades to
come.

. Part of the reason this deci-
sion has been delayed is that origi-
nally it was thoughtthat Richardson
Field might be used for academic
space in the future, and therefore
the new track and soccer field
would have to be located on the
IMAC fields.. Only very recently
has it been decided that academic
space will not be extended in that
direction.

taken these and other concerns to
Princeton as a Professor of Politi-
cal Philosophy. . As one of only
seven ina Harvard Fellowship Pro-

gram, Kiss is studying "Ethics and,

the Professions".

With standing room only in
the 900 Room on Thursday, March
4, Dr. Kiss lectured on "Identity
Politics: Democracy's Friend or
Foe?" as apartofthe Union Alumni
Lecture Series. In opening she
voiced her concerns for America,
the tossed salad as opposed to
America, the melting pot.

“At this time there is an in-
creasing sense of fragementation
and disunity in America and the

world at large. Icanonly hope that —

we will soon reach a point when
people will concentrate on fights
that will benefit the world as a
whole rather than their own identi-
ties.”
Citing historical artifacts as
examples Kiss went on to address
identity politics insymbolic terms.
She questioned the audience,
“Should the United States flag have

the Confederate stars and bars in
it?”

When considering the ques-
tion in termsof political identity,she
answered, the presence of the Con-
federate motif within the U.S. flag
is symbolic only of “group sur-
vival” and not the pain and suffer-
ing of a past era.

After tracing identity politics
from the beginnings of immigra-
tion to the present Dr. Kiss offered
these words, “Our, culture is not
that simple arid we need to be in the
practice of getting together to dis-
cover and construct needs and val-
ues. In this way we can broaden
our conceptions of who we are and
what our needs are.” .

Looking to the future. Kiss
closed her address with some ad-
vice on how to minimize the ef-

- fects of identity politics. “Wemust

all recognize that we are not the
norm and we mustall better under-
stand how a group operates under
identity politics: learning to deal
with group dissent, charige in goals,
and relationships.”
