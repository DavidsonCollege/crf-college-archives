New WebTree fruitful

By Nick AsMa AND EmiLy Drew

After experiencing numerous delays and
problems during registration last year, an
updated WebTree system was implemented
for Spring ’02 registration.

Students were encouraged to register on-
line before the final deadline, November 14,
to avoid system overload. Scheduled time
slots for registration were assigned by last
name to further improve efficiency.

The on-line registration process has
greatly improved the quickness and conve-
nience from the traditional bubble-sheet
method. Students have already noticed the
improvements.

After filling out his Spring registration on-
line, Seth Davis ’02 noted, “It didn’t take
more than 10 minutes, as opposed to the hour
that it took me last year. This year seems
faster overall.”

Registrar Hansford Epes points out that the
accuracy of the process has greatly improved
as well. The WebTree, for example, greets
students by name and verifies the CRN so that
students are alerted to possible errors.

Additionally, the on-line method is able to
easily include students who are off campus.
“We no longer are receiving crumpled paper

bubble sheets from all over the world—often
past the registration deadline,” says Epes.
After last spring’s registration delays, the
staff at ITS developed improvements in the
WebTree program. The program now oper-
ates under a more powerful server and has
been changed for greater efficiency.
The Registrar’s Office has worked with
departmental chairs and faculty to encourage
students to register early and avoid an over-
load of system users on the last night before
the WebTree closes.
“There is little that can be done, however,”
notes Epes, “that would allow a couple of
hundred people to be using WebTree simul-
taneously without ‘the kind of severe slow-
down—gridlock—that we had last spring.”
The length of the registration period itself
has been doubled this year to help prevent
such a situation.
Those students who chose to register early
have noticed the ease and speed of the pro- [7
cess. Blair Hance ’04 said, “I thought it . [
worked really well. It was convenient to do
it on my own time-frame.”
Although changes have been made in the
computer format, registration is still based on
the random lottery in which everyone is as-
signed one class before anyone has a chance
at a second class.

from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.
