FOOTBALL SEASON SUMMARY
AND INDIVIDUAL WRITE-UPS

Wildcat Warriors Deserve Much
Credit for Splendid Work.

The Season.

When the referee’s whistle ended the
Furman game, it rang down the curtain |
on Davidson’s twenty-fourth football
scason. Some of those twenty-four have
been more successful than the one just |
closed; teams of other. years have out- |
shone that of this season. But the fol-

‘lowers of the Red and Black have just |
cause for pride in their 1921 gridiron |
eleven.

Adding up the results, we find that |
the Wildcats have won three, tied three}
and lost four games this season. On|
the face of it, it appears to be only medi- |
ocre. But when we remember that all!
the games tied were with teams consid- |
ered to be stronger than ours and that |
from a moral standpoint they may be
classed as victories, the matter is seen
in a new light.

And one of the defeats will go down
in history as the eighth wonder of the
world.

F, M. Simmons, leading football au-
thority in the state, in picking his all-
state team awards three places to Da-
vidson men, Captain LaFar, Moore and
Schenck were the men honored, while S.
M. Davis,“McFadden, Shepherd and Fai-
son were also in the running.

To Coaches Grey and Black too much
credit cannot be given. They have work-
ed tirelessly and desefve a large portion
of praise due the team for their great
work. The season was hardly over be-
fore Coach Grey began laying plans for
next year, Nine letter men are expected
to report for practice next fall and sev-
eral of this year’s subs seem ripe for a
step into higher circles.

Capt.’D. R. LaFar”
Guard, D**

By his wonderful work this season Doc
has proven himself to be the right kind
of a leader. Playing his third year of
varsity ball he has shown himself to be
the peer of all the guards in the state.
Down in the muck of the line where
there is no duty but that of duty well
done, he has been the rallying point for
the entire team. He was: on the side-
lines in three games, with a bad knee,
but he made a lasting impression on
every team he played against.

Doc has not announced his plans for
next year but every Davidson man hopes
fervently that he will return next year
and help carry the Red and Black to

Captain-elect J. S. Moore
Halfback, D*

“That 130 pound, elusive, slippery,
whirling, ‘laggy’ little fellow of Hugh
Grey’s Wildcats who. to tackle by one
leg is not enough to stop.” Spratt is the
most brilliant of the first magnitude stars
in the local pigskin firmament. He is
|the longest individual ground gainer on
|the team and in addition, backs up the
line with the best of them. His sensa-
tional flying tackles bring back-the days
when Tiny Graham cavoted around on
Sprunt Field.

While . his specialty was ticking off
yardage around the flanks, Spratt could}
hit the line with the force of a six-inch |
gun and dodge his way through a broken |
His work in the}
Wake Forest and Carolina games alone}
were enough to win him undying glory. |
To look at him one would never take |
him to be a phenomenon in strength |
or endurance, but in two years he has}
never been knocked out, despite the}
many mass heaps that have been piled |
on him. |

J. A. Schenck |
Quarterback and End, D*

John Schenck

Schenck was the third member of the

team to win a place on the all-state
eleven. He had the double duties of
playing end and quarter but proved him-
self equal to the task. During the period
that Doc LaFar was out of the game he
also acted as captain. In his role of
quarter he always seemed to know just
which play to call. He could hit the line
like a torpedo overcharged with T. N.
Y., and was an excellent open field run-
ner.

Simmons in commenting on his work
says: “As an offensive end Schenck
stood alone.” He could diagnose a play
instantly, get down under punts in-
stantly and swoop up a free ball like a
hawk. His 7o yard run following a re-
covered fumble in the Elon game was
the longest made by‘any Wildcat during

S. M. Davis
Tackle, D**

While not of the spectacular type of
player that the grandstand is quick to
applaud, Davis proved himself to be one
of the most consistent linemen produced
at Davidson in some time. Although not
heavy, he is strong and aggressive; his
experience together with his hard charg-
ing has made him one of the most 'fear-
ed men in the line-up.

In the P. C. game his knee was injured
and he was out until the Wofford game.
The team took on new life with his re-
turn and played the best games of the

season. His work in the Virginia and
Richmond games was particularly bril-
liant.

With the possible exception of Floyd
and Weathers, of State, there is no bet-
ter tackle than Davis in North Caro-
lina, and with the experience and weight
gained this year he will surely make all-

the beginning of the season he spent

Rooster McFadden

three weeks’ in a Charlotte hospital,
voluntarily undergoing on operation in
order to be in shape for the season. He
cannot be too highly commended for his
spirit and sacrifice.

Adept at line-smashing, Rooster’s
skillful work in the passing and punting
departments won for him the well de-
served berth on the all-state second
tcam in the accompanying pick. With-
out detracting from the wonder work of
Schenck and Moore in receiving the
swineskin, the skill and accuracy of the
passer deserves more credit than is
usually given them, Always good, Mc-
Fadden’s punting at times was little
short of phenominal. He also brought
his educated toe into action on several
occasions in drop-kicking.

Rooster is another Senior, but we
hope the call of the gridiron will be
strong enough to bring him back for
one more season.

R. M. Brice
Guard, D

After three years of hard work, Brice
was~ finally rewarded for his labors this
year by winning the coveted monogram.
Although handicapped by injuries in sev-
eral games, he has been the most de-
pendable of all the linemen.

M. D. Field

Center, D
Mason, the tall, hefty center of Hugh
Gicy’s fighting red machine, earned his

defensive work. Although handicapped

several games, his work stamped him as
}a great center. He is an accurate pass-

end runs borders on perfection.

His knee was hurt in the Wake Forest
‘game and he was out until the State
game, when he showed his real class,
completely outclassing his opponent. In
the Carolina contest, while playing the
game of his life, he was again injured
and didn’t get back in the fray ’till the
Furman encounter. All Davidson sup-
porters-are tooking forward to~secing
him in action next year without the jinx
under which he has labored this year.

C. M. Davis
End, D

Nappy ran wild on the Wildcats’ left
flank this season and pulled down: the
coveted monogram just as surely and as
easily as he pulled down the passes
which Rooster shot to him. On the de-
fensive, Nappy changed places with
Schenck and played in the backfield. He
did his work as a defensive as well if not
as spectacularly as he did on end, Near
the end of the State game when it ap-
peared as if a pass was to fall incom-
pleted, Nappy appeared from nowhere
and grabbed the elusive pigskin for a
long gain. With Nappy and ’dias back
both flanks: will be well guarded and the
Wildcat forward passing attack will be
still more formidable next season.

GENERAL SURVEY OF STATE
SEASON IN FOOTBALL WORK

|Dope Bucket Upset All Along the
Line in the Scores Made.

The characteristic feature of the foot-
| ball season just passed has been the
{number of times the dope bucket has
| been turned over. We find it in our own
season, as in the Wake Forest, N. C.
State and Furman games. We find it in
Carolina football, as Trinity’s 17-0 vic-
|tory over Wake Forest and Carolina’s
| Victory over Virginia, and it is found
in football all over the country. A few
statistics of the season might be inter-
esting.

At Davidson during the season just
passed the Wildcats made the largest
number of points in proportion to their
opponents of any season in the past
three years.

1921. Davidson__-165

John Schenck proved the principal
point scorer for the Wildcats, netting 53

Not only in points scored did the Wild-
cats of ’21 outrank their opponents, but
in first downs also Davidson made 137 or
an average of 16 7-9 per game for the
nine games whose records were avail-
able, while our opponents’ first downs
reached 105, or an average of 11 2-3 per
game.
