Dr. Samuel) D. Maloney. David-
son's Deputy Director of Civil
Defense and chairman of the Da-
vidson College Fallout Protec-
tion Committee.

According to the Charlotte
Civil Defense Office the largest
group ever assembled in the
county before now for the course
has been 22.

The purpose of the 10-hour
course is to provide ‘‘trained and
responsible leadership for the
éuccessful operation of a shelter
program.” Within seven of the
campus buildings are 15 desig-
nated shelter areas, and Ma-
foney says the program should
have at least three managers
for each shelter, as the national
Civil Defense program advises.

The town of Davidson, in-
cluding students, has a popula-
tion of about 2,800, Maloney
says. The shelters provide space
for 3,000 or more.

“The shelters will be inte-
grated, of course,” Maloney
sald. “There will probably be
some natural divisions work-
ed out among shelter assign-

gym and chemistry teachers to
Dana Science Building, but if
someone wants segregated
shelters he is free to go else-
where.”

All supplies are in for all but
two of the shelter areas, he
noted. Provisions include food,
water, medical and sanitation
necessities, and radiation mon-
itoring equipment all sufficient
for a two-week full-capacity en-
closure.

“Let me emphasize that these
are not bomb shelters at all,”
Maloney pointed out. “‘We aren't
too worried about that since
there are no primary target
areas in North Carolina. But the
shelters have been designated
as adequate for fallout protec-
tion, which may be necessary in
the event of nuclear attack, al-
though we would be allowed
more time to take cover than if
there were a blast nearby.”

“I hope we can provide cards
with information as to the prop-
er shelter procedures for all in-
volved when plans finalize.” the
professor said. ‘‘We should have

Davidson Alumnus
fo Speak Tuesday

Alvin P. Perkinson, Davidson
class of 1957, will speak in as-
sembly Tuesday, March 10, on
active political participation,
thus becoming the second speak-
er this semester urging such
student involvement in the po-
litical arena.

He is expected to touch par-
ticularly on whether Davidson
does or should contribute to an
active political atmosphere.

A real. estate developer in
Charlotte. Perkinson is at the
present time interested in enter-
ing politics, though he has not
yet made up his mind as to what
level. Although he is being spon-
sored by the Conservative Club,
Perkinson is a moderate liberal
who has yet to join the ranks of
the Democrats or the Republi-
cans.

While at Davidson he was
president of his Senior Class,
president of the IFC, member
of Omicron Delta Kappa honor-
ary leadership fraternity and
Phi Delta Theta social frater-
nity.

By Freudian Approach

BY TOM LOFLIN

Dr. Jose Barchiion, athe-
ist, did not come to David-
son to swallow Christian
hens, as did his predecessor
Michael Scriven. He came
to unevangelically state a
psychological challenge to
Christianity.

Christian Davidson provided
answers to Barchilon in the per-
sons of its Psychology Dept.
head, Dr. W. G. Workman, and
Rabbi Israel J. Gerber.

Only one question was really
decided by the discussion of the
three last night. It was the same
question that Scriven and Dr.
Earl MacCormac decided in
their debate a month ago on the
existence of God: there is no
rational or scientific explana-
tion that can be made to prove
God's existence.

Workman, like MacCormac,
stated that the Christian belief
in God comes partly from a

revelation from the realm out-
side of man and his hatural
world, partly from man’s leap of
faith.

“Theistic Christianity talks
about revelation from without.”
Workman said. ‘‘To the Chris-
tian, ‘mystery’ is a meaning-
ful word, where it is not to the
Naturalist. There is a part of
Christian faith that is uncer-
tain. The Christian says that
Supernaturalism may not be so,
but I'l! take my stand on it and
order my life on it.”

Barchilon, like Scriven, would
not concede that man can re-
ceive revelation from without.
“He (Workman) speaks of evi-
dence and revelation from with-
out.” Barchilon answered. ‘‘To
me that is just an unknown. I
don't know what he's talking
about.”’

Gerber’'s main argument as
to the proof of the existence of
a God was that God exists be-
cause man needs him to add a
missing quality to his life. “Why
do we need God?" he asked.
“Because it is this which adds

YMCA ‘Challenge’ Series
To Throw Covers Off Sex

BY BRITT SNIDER

“Sex as a Challenge to the
Christian Paith’’ will be the fifth
topic for discussion in the YM-
CA's series of forums on con-
temporary challenges to the
Christian religion. The featured
speaker will be Dr. William
Cole, president of Lake Forest
College. Lake Forest, Ill, who
will be joined in the forum by
his wife Doris.

Dr. and Mrs. Cole will arrive
on campus on Thursday, March
12. Dr. Cole will address the
student body during chapel peri-
od that morning after which a
coffee hour will be held in the
Morrison Room of the Union.
Later, at 3 o'clock, an informal
“bull session’ is scheduled in
the Morrison Room. The forum
will conclude that evening with

an address by Dr. Cole at 8:15
which will be followed by a
short discussion.

‘Cole has served as president
of Lake Forest College for the
past four years. Prior to this,
he was Professor of Religion and
Dean of Freshmen at Williams
College. He also has served as
chaplain at Western Reserve
University, Columbia University,
and Smith College. He received
his BD degree from Union The-
ological Seminary and his PhD
from Columbia University.

In addition, he is author of
several books and articles, in-
cluding Sex in Christianity and
Psychoanalysis and Sex and
Love in the Bible.

He holds honorary degrees
from Grinnell College and Col-
gate University, and is chair-
man of the Hlinois Commission
on Human Relations.

To outer space and into the deep sea, we take the sum
total of our scientific and managerial knowledge. A case
in point is Telstar, which represents the first step toward
a worldwide communications system. Another exampie,
the new deep-sea amplifier that simultaneously transmits
two-way messages. Both communications triumphs stem
from Bell System planning, research and development.

Such trailblazing projects command the best of

throughout the Bell System, men with college training as
diverse as the responsibilities they shoulder. Their back-
grounds run the gamut from liberal arts and business
courses to science or specialized engineering majors.

quality to life, it takes us out of
meaninglessness."’

At the beginning of the dis-
cussion, Barchilon perhaps sur-
prised some by saying, “I am a
firm believer of the concept of
God in religion. The concept of
God has become more and more
where I think it belongs: within
man, Whether He exists outside
of man, I don’t know, but I have
found no evidence for it.

‘Our fears are facts we should
all accept and learn to live
with,"’ he continued. ‘‘But some
of us do not, and look to some-
thing outside ourselves to ‘ex-

I would buy the idea that there
is at least a psychological need
for some to say there is a God.
In early history the invention
of God was an exceptionally
clever thing. It's still so clever
that I might wonder what I'm
doing up here.”

Is there indeed a God? David-
son students should now know
that His existence cannot be
proven either rationally or
scientifically: Chtristian thinkers
here have acknowledged _ this
fact. The problem of faith and
revelation must be left up to the
individual, for they are things
that cannot be truly debated.
