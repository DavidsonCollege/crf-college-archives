ule Studied

The possibility of receiving vesper’s attendance credit for attending ehurch in
another town is curently being discussed by the faculty Religious Life Committee as
part of an extensive study of student religious Iife.

A report on findings will be
issued by the committee some-
time after spring vacation.

The standing committee, ap-
pointed by President D. Grier
Martin, is composed of mem-
bers of the faculty and student
body, with Chaplain Will Terry
serving as chairman.

Terry described the commit-
tee’s work as ‘discussing the
religious program of Davidson
College per se, not individual
elements in it, but the entire
seope of the program.” The
committee hopes to find the
“aims and goals” of a religious
program, and the test means
of implementing them.

° CATHOLIC STUDENTS

Prompted by the request of
several Roman Catholic stu
dents at Davidson, the commit-
tee is discussing whether Cath-
olis students should be: allowed
ta teceive vesper attendance
credit for attending Mass in
Mooresville.

More generally, the commit-
tee. which meets at least every
other week, will be discussing
whether attendance at any
church should be acceptable to,
fulfill the vesper's attendance |
requirement. :

The role of chapels in a re-
ligious program and required
attendance at such programs:
will also be discussed by the

| committee during its next few |

sessions . A suggestion often
made ‘by students at Davidson
of limiting. chapel to two pro-
grams per week will alsa be

brought up. r

Serving along with Terry on
the committee are Dr. D. D.
Rhodes. Dr. L. B. Schenck. Prof.
Donald Plott, President Mar-
tin, Dean Richard C. Burts, Rev.
Curis Harpter, Lanier Burns,
Jesse Simms, and Neil Me-
Bryde.

In the course of their studies of the nature
of sound, Bell System scientists have been
able to make significant contributions to all
three forms of entertainment.

You might say that it was because the dis-
coveries were there to be discovered by the
first explorers to come down the trail.

When the century was still young, we real-
ized that if the telephone were to come up
to its potential, the nature of sound had to
be much better understood than it was then.

This led to the largest, most comprehensive

C\

study of sound ever undertaken by anyone.

To capture sound for study, Bell Telephone
Laboratories developed the first electronic re-
corder for phonograph discs. For the first
time, performers recorded into microphones.

Then, in 1925, Bell Labs perfected an elec-
tronic system that synchronized sound and
action on movie film. The talkies wete born.

To get better sound reproduction, they
started experimenting in 1933 with ways to
separate high and low frequencies to prevent
distortion. The result was a single-groove,

taulti-channel disc—the basis of today’s stereo
phonic industry.

Nevertheless, these contributions were by-
products of the real effort, which was to make
telephone service better. We are proud, of
course, that they helped build and improve
whole industries.

But we're prouder of the sound qualities in
the telephone of today.

If you'd like to do business or engineering
work you're really proud of, we'd like to talk
to you.
