son Tuesday at Johnson C.

assistant coach Ted Severn
are hoping for a_ .500 ‘sea-
son. ‘ Stevens commented
that the schedule included
several tough teams, includ-

“ing VJM.1., Clemson, and
William—and. Mary. ‘‘As our
freshmen get experience,
we should get better and bet-
ter,’~ he - stated.

Jim Newton, the returning:

senior letterman and holder
“of the school’ records in the

fifty and one-hundred meter
freestyle, has been chosen
captain of this year’s squad

Several other members

ing inclyde Mait Browning

Davidson and John Fawcett
in’ the free style, Raymond
Grubb in the fly, Jack

' ‘Hobbs in the backstroke,
and Jeff Loughridge in the

distance freestyle.

ing for high © achievement

The Davidson Wildcats
are riding on top-of the
Southern Conference after
their 6052 win over East
Carolina last Tuesday.

The conference race is the
closest in recent years, with
six “teams fighting for ‘the
top position. F
' (Davidson holds the num-

‘ber one position with a 4-1

record. Close behind are
-Furman, East Carolina, ‘The

_ Citadel; Willigm and Mary,

all with 3-2 season totals.
Coach Terry Holland point-

ed out the importance of
holding the number one posi-

tion ‘until the conference
playoffs. ‘ !
There are only seven

teams in the conference, so
~for. the first-time. the con-
ference leader will receive
a bye in the first round of
the tournament. The first

—=ranked team will only play

two playoff games instead of
the usual three.

‘We cannot afford to lose
another game," ° Holland
said, ‘because ‘we play the
conference minimum, ten
games, and any one of the
second -place teams could
edge us out of first place by
winning the remainder of
their conference games.”

The Wildcats will risk their
8-5 season record tomorrow
night’ at Princeton.

‘Princeton has one of the

toughest teams we will meet
this year,’’ (Wolland said,
“they are young, mostly
sophomores like us, but they

have two outstanding
guards.”’
The Tigers are led by

guard Brian Taylor, a 63
sophomore with a 24 points
a game average. Holland
called him ‘'a sophomore
Charlie Scott’’ due to his ex-
cellent shooting and re-
bounding.

Holland forecasts more
problems in defending
against the Tigers, because
they have a second strong
guard in Ted Manakas.

‘We will have to pressure
the guards and force the ball
to the baseline, which is to
their . advantage.”’ Holland
said.

The Princeton front line is
tall, headed by senior Bill
Sickler and 68 sophomore
allsAmerican, Bill Drake.

Holland said he felt the

Wildcats handled the East

Carolina team very well.

During the last minutes. of
the game, Davidson kept
control of the ball and slow-
ed the game down.

East Carolina came within

one point of the ‘Cats, but
lost the momentum when

%

Steve Kirley sank a layup
with 29 seconds remaining.

Kirley and Joe Sutter led
the scoring in the East Caro-
lina game _ with 15 points
apiece. Duncan Postma. fol-
lowed with ‘13.

Bryan ‘Adrian leads the
overall season scoring with
an 18 point average for the
three games he has played.

Holland said that no fore-
cast could be made on when
Adrian could return to the

lineup.
“‘Although he is hitting
about 20 points a game, he

has not fully recovered and
he’s playing poor defense,’’
Holland said.

Holland” feels that Eric
Minkin is not playing up to
his potential either.

*““At the first of the year
I would have said that' Min-
kin would be all-conference
and score 20 points a game,”
he said, ‘‘but his injury has
slowed him down more than
we had anticipated."

Minkin has average da 6.8

Face Princeton

points a game and 6.8 re-
bounds.

Sophomore Joe Sutter
holds the second scoring
honors with 16.2 points a
game.

HoNand said. that he was
very pleased with Sutter’s
playing. Although he said
Sutter’ often played spotty,
Holland cited him as one of
the Wildcats strengths.

Another sophomore (Hol-
land praised was Gordon
Graham.

“Graham is an excellent
shooter,’ he stated.’’ and he
has worked very hard on
defense and ball handling,
which were his weakness-
es.”’

Holland also commended
the playing of Billy Pierce.
‘‘Even though he scored only
one point in the East Caro-
lina game, I feel he played
very well,”’--Holland said.
“‘We had to maintain con-
trol of the ball~during the
last. minutes and Pierce

"handled himself very well.”

Wildcat Club Falls Short

Although the Wildcat
Club's drive for raising
funds for football scholar-
ships fell short, the director
of- the fund drive, Steve
Heckard, is hopeful that the
trustees will make up the
difference in their spring
meeting.

The anticipated sum to de-
fray scholarships was set at
$150,000. The drive which
ended on December 31 net-
ted only $80,657.

“I don’t know for sure
what. will be done since we
didn't reach our goal,” said
Heckard. “I think it will be
recommended that the col-
lege make up the difference

because of the short time we
had.”

Heckard was very pleased
with the results. ‘'Con-
sidering the fact the drive
didn’t get under way until
late Augtst. I think we had
a real good response.”

Heckard explained that
Coach Fagg .will go ahead
with his recruiting for next
year on the premise the col-
lege will make up the dif-
ference.

He also added the Wild-
cat Athletic Fund Drive will
be continued this year to
raise scholarship money for
the following year.
