Vigilante justice: Down with the freak

O: those rare days that I leave my
apartment and attend class, I’m
always surprised “by just how many

some of the more dynamic and intrigu-
ing characters on this campus.

Being the modest type, I usually
just smile and answer, “You get used to
it. Here, have a Mento. It’s the
Freshmaker, you know.”

At least, that’s what I used to say.
Now I can’t help but feel tawdry and
cheap when people think I’m interest-
ing, because the truth of the matter is
my life pales in comparison to that of
the befuddled campus freak discussed
in earlier issues of the Davidsonian.

I know, you’re probably already
planning on skipping the rest of this
article, saying to yourself, “It’s another
trip into the world of the campus freak.
Someone couldn’t come up with a de-
cent Op-Edarticle topic, so they’ re swip-
ing someone else’s.”

Perhaps that’s true, but I’m going
to do it anyway. You see, I’ve met the
campus freak, I’ve seen him in action,
and I’ve even talked to him before.

The campus freak is not just a
campus freak. He happens to be more
expansive and enterprising than that.
He’s managed to secure a firm grip on
the title of the greater Davidson-

This guy shares the wealth. He
can be found on Sunday afternoons

Hickory Hams freak, and
most importantly, he’s the Taco Bell
freak.

Sunday afternoon. At least, I think I
talked to him. He may have been talk-
ing to himself while looking at me. He
also kept swatting at flies around his
face that weren't there.

The important thing is that he and
I made eye contact. A frightening
amount of eye contact. I looked freak-
hood in the face, and it scared me. This
guy is dangerous. He could seriously
harm someone someday — someone
like you.

That’s right, you, the guy in the
khakis and the baseball hat. As students
at a small conservative school, we only
have one option left to us to protect

side note, this would also finally give
me the chance to establish a club sport
at Davidson that I can play: mayhem.
We're already way behind in the season
against schools like Washington & Lee
and Sewanee. They’ ve already hospi-
talized three trespassers this semester
between the two of them.

But I’m confident that with the
bright, angry students we have on this
campus we can more than make up for
a late start. If you are interested in
forming a squad with me, talk to me.

But don’t ask me about being dy- °

namic and intriguing. Because I’m
fresh out of Mentos.

A study: Human suffering at Davidson

H ave you ever wondered what hap
pens to the human mind when one
doesn’t sleep for several days? I know
for a fact that the results can be down-
right ugly,
and I’m
sure most
other up-

This article is meant to explore the
hype behind the hyperbole. Somebody
has to do it, and I might as well be the
one.

Insimple, unscien-
tific terms, I have just
completed an experiment
that adequately depicts

perclass-
m eon
would
agree.

I believe my longest stretch of +

sleeplessness (please excuse me while I
reminisce) occurred the first semester
of my freshman year. For some reason,
I had landed myself in a 300-level an-
thropology class with no prior knowl-
edge of culture, society, etc. Hell, I’m
from Nevada — some unpopulated
desert for all you care. Any-
way, I managed to pry my eyelids apart
for 55 straight hours for this class to
prepare a paper and presentation I had
to give. I vaguely remember falling
over in the grass in a spasm of dizziness
| after I had turned in that sucker — late,
I might add.

Does any justifiable reason exist
at all for anyone to subject themselves
to this kind of torture? Should one risk
bodily damage for intellectual gratifi-
cation?

At Davidson, the answer to this
question is yes. The students at this
institution seem to thrive on masochis-
tic martyrdom. And you know, that’s
where this whole “daving” thing origi-
nates from. When someone asks you
how your work is going, you and I both
say: “Man, I’m screwed. Ican’t believe
that I have 27 papers due this week.”

. OK, maybe 27 is a bit of an exag-
geration, but that’s exactly the point.
You see, the very beauty of “daving”
stems from its blatant use of hyperbole.
We embellish the weight of our course
loads because we harbor a strange de-
sire to wallow in self-pity.

In other words, Davidson students
baste themselves repeatedly before vol-
untarily jumping into the oven.

Does that make sense? (I can’t
believe I just wrote that. Man, I must be
tired.)

the state of several sleep
deprived Davidson stu-
dents. Sure, you tell your
friends that you didn’t get
any rest last night, but do you have any
hard evidence?

This week just happened to be a
doozy for me and my three roommates,
so I volunteered the four of us to be the
subjects of my study, one that will prove
once and for.all that inhuman suffering
does in fact exist here at Davidson. Hart
303, as you will soon see, turned out to
be the perfect laboratory.

The following excerpts are taken
from the aforesaid apartment’s journal

lunch-induced erection: “I ate some
tomato soup and a grilled cheese, and
then I got an erection,” he says. “It was
neat.”

Is there any better definition of
insanity? In order to justify the irratio-
nal behavior of that night, let me intro-
duce to you the statistics I accumulated
during my study. The following num-
bers indicate the number of hours of
sleep during a particular night.

Rob got five hours of sleep the
night of Sept. 21, five Sept. 22, and
fifteen minutes Sept. 23.

Howary got two-and-a-half hours
Sept. 21, three Sept. 22, and a whopping
five Sept. 23. ,

Gant got two Sept. 21, five Sept.
22, and three hours and 45 .minutes
Sept. 23.

Finally, W.C. got two-and-a-half
hours Sept. 21, five Sept. 22, and four
hours and 15 minutes Sept. 23.

An analysis of these figures is in-
deed frightening.

Over a three-day

period, the four morons
of Hart 303 slept a com-
bined 43 hours. On aver-
age, that’s 3.58 hours of

on the night of Sept. 22. I have chosen
to mask the identities of all parties in-
volved — for obvious reasons, as you
will see.

10:15 p.m.: Howary, trying to
overcome a dip-induced seizure, has
just swooned to the carpet — the poor
fella!

10:30 p.m.: Gant and Rob, I be-
lieve, have had too much coffee. They
appear to be having uncontrollable,
ungodly bouts of dysentery.

11:05 p.m.: Howary starts sing-
ing Hanson. What is wrong with us?

¢11:09 p.m.: Rob: “I’m starting to
get desperate. . . “

e11:15p.m.: Does the Easter Bunny
live on Easter Island? Isn’t that incon-
venient?

11:22 p.m.: Gant ponders the
thought of investing in Maalox futures.
God knows he could use some.

12:25 p.m.: W.C. discusses a

sleep per person per night.

If you take the
healthy man’s required sleep total to be
approximately eight hours a night, then
Rob, Howary, Gant, and W.C. should
have slept a total of 96 hours over the
three days. However, Hart 303 has
outdone themselves with a grand total
of 43,

That’s only 44 percent of the rec-
ommended daily allowance.

What, then, are the far-reaching
implications of this study? I can think
of only one. We, as masochistic
Davidson students, deserve to complain
and hyperbolize as much as we want.

Why? . Because we're tired and
omery.

So next time someone asks you to
describe your workload to them, don’t
be afraid to exaggerate. Say you are
going crazy — because you probably
are.

At Davidson, such an exaggera-
tion isn’t all that far from the truth.

- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 1997 —

In past articles of mine, I have
sought to unite students by leading an
assault on the evil deeds of others.
From the Gates of Doom to the Pulper
to the Antichrist, I am proud of the
hard work you have all done.

Weare now much closer to crack-
ing the code, getting glasses back in
the Commons, and we have, inevita-
bly, gotten closer to the end of the
world. This week, instead of pointing
the finger at oth-
ers, I propose we
look at the evil
within — our-
selves.

Lately, in
my constant ef-
fort to unite the
campus community, I have noticed
that the honeymoon is over. The re-
laxed, carefree feeling that most stu-
dents have at the beginning of the year
has given way to the stress and anxiety
of papers and tests. When informing
others of fun, uniting events on cam-
pus, I usually heard these soulchilling
words: “Sorry, I’m too busy.”

I'll be the first to admit that I’ve
said these words myself, but THIS IS
EVIL! No matter how busy weare, we

We’re all too busy

Once again, students, we must unite}

Union, and after grabbing something
to eat at the Cafe, go upstairs and
dance your cares away.

The bar is always open for those
who may just want to have a drink, sit
and talk, and listen to some good mu-
sic. Whether you stay for 10 minutes
or an hour and a half, Disco Night is
there for you to relax, have fun, and
meet other students.

The Wailing Wall will be a
conversation
board that will
soon be installed
inthe Union. The
idea for the wall
emerged through
an unpleasant in-
cident last year
with the Alcohol Awareness Graffiti
Board in the Union Gallery.

Through this experience and my
conversations with students afterward,
I learned that there are many opinions
— healthy and unhealthy — that stu-
dents are unable to express because a
medium for the sort of expression does
not exist. I found that there is no
consistent public forum for opinions
that do not constitute an op-ed piece in
the Davidsonian, but still deserve to be

fun with others. Everyone is busy and
everyone has a lot of work to do at one
time or another. That’s just the way
Davidson is.

But we must fight the tendency to
become so self-inyolved that we no
longer relate to other members of our
Davidson family.

There is much more to a “well-

rounded” college experience than aca-

demics.

Listen to yourself this week, and
note how many times you hear your-
self turn down fun interaction with
your peers for work.

We must make time! We must
have fun! Students must unite!

Two approaching events at the
Union for which I hope students will
make time are Disco Night and the
Wailing Wall.

Disco Night, every other Thurs-
day at 10 p.m., is the perféct place to
have fun and relax. Imagine flashing
multicolor lights, strobes, fog, and
some pumping bass, and you have

No matter how busy you are ona

spend I be-
having 7 lieve that

open communication is necessary for
a healthy college and student body,
and the Wailing Wall is my answer to
this need. It will serve as a place for
students to vent — in a constructive
manner, mind you — about issues of
concern. It will be a place to ask
questions and get answers, to: learn
from-others and learn about oneself.

The Wailing Wall will be located
in the TV lounge on the right wall just
inside the door. It will be separated
into three sections: campus issues,
community (local, national, and glo-
bal) issues, and miscellaneous con-
cerns. Look out for more information
about the wall in the weeks ahead.

I'm very excited about it, and I
hope you will be, too.

As always, come to the Union,
the place where all God’s children are
welcome and none are excluded.

Express your opinion on the
Wailing Wall, dance at Disco Night,
drink some coffee, and see a movie.

Have fun, talk, and relax with
your friends, old and new. Do your
work later.
