Football players show some skin & macho

By JIM CROWE
Sports Editor

Nine wildcat football players
sporting Mohawk haircuts have
been the center of much atten-
tion during the past two weeks.

On Friday, October 3, Dean
Garvin, Herm Lowe, Svend
Pederson, Pat Pope, Stan
Klinger, Bryan Lowe, Jeff Cain,
Pat Sheridan, and Atmire Bail-
ey all had their heads shaved,
leaving one center strip of hair.
Most also had their jersey
numbers sculpted in hair on the
back of their heads.

Senior Pat Sheridan said that
while several players had dis-
cussed the haircuts prior to that
Friday, the decision to visit
Norton’s Barbershop on Main

Street was a spontaneous one, ~

spurred by preparations for the
Bucknell game the next day.

We reality neeaea to beat
Bucknell, so some of us decided
to put it on the line,”’ Sheridan
said. ‘‘We all got the Mohawks
to help team togetherness...I
think the team reacted really
well. Then, of course, it really
made the haircuts seem worth-
while when we won the game.”
Davidson beat Bucknell 21-13
that Saturday at Richardson
Stadium.

Sheridan said the players had
different reasons for going
through with the haircuts. ‘I
got the haircut because it’s my
senior year and I won’t be
playing football again. I just
wanted something to help me
remember my last season.”

Some players commented
that the haircut made playing a
lot more comfortable.. Dean
Garvin said, ‘Playing without
hair is a lot cooler, and you
don’t have a lot of hair falling in

your face or getting caught in

your helmet.”

_ While the haircuts may have
helped team spirit and made
playing more comfortable, the
Mohawk squad has run into
some interesting problems off
the field.

On campus, the players get
double-takes just about every
time they step out. And Sheri-
dan commented, ‘‘You just

about have to give up on
meeting girls when your head

Some football players find it’s cooler without hair. —

looks like this.”’

Off-campus reactions have
been even stronger. Garvin told
the story of going to the grocery
store with his parents. “Every-
body stopped and turned a-
round to point at me. They all
really thought that I was going
to blow the store up or some-
thing.’”’

Another drawback, Sheridan
pointed out was that the shaved
hair takes so long to grow back.

Soccer falls
flat against

Appalachian
State

By STEVE SOUD

The soccer team soundly -

beaten by Appalachian State,
can’t dwell on last Saturday’s
loss, but must look forward to
several tough games.

Yesterday the team fared a
very tough Furman squad that
is also vying for conference
silver. Now, however, the team
is looking to a home game
against UNCC, and that, too, is
always a big game.

After Saturday’s showing,
though, it may look as if the
team is far from ready for tough
play, but that is quite to the
contrary. Chris Roberts, who
had gone through a five game
goal-scoring drought, seems to
have shaken-that off as he
scored the lone Davidson goal
Saturday. Chuck Price, a junior
forward on the team, comment-
ed, ‘‘We were just scared of
them at the start.”

That fear showed— Davidson
lacked any aggressiveness at
the start of the game. By the

With the’ sipprebsnsion of the

Roberts apparently back on
track, the team appears to be

week. Should Furman knock off
the Citadel, the second place
race would be up for grabs.

muster after coming up short on
several key plays.

The Terriers jumped out to a
quick 21-0 lead in the first
quarter as Jim Jenson ran for
two touchdowns and passed for
a third before Davidson could

get untracked, in the second

quarter Ray Sinclair picked up
the Cats first score as he bulled
in from three yards out; Wayne
Paymer booted the PAT.
Freshman Todd Hermetz, play-
ing in his first game, set up
Sinclair’s score by hauling in a
40 yard reception from Brian
Whitmire, Hermetz was pressed
into action when Gifford Piercy
reinjured his foot in the early
going and did not return. The
homestanding Terriers led 21-7
at the half.

The Wildcats mounted a
comeback in the third quarter
as Alvin Atkinson scored his
initial points of the season on a
20-yard touchdown reception.
Atkinson played sparingly how-
ever, due to an injured knee,
sustained in preseason, which
refuses to come around. After
Paymer’s successful PAT, Dav-
idson trailed 21-14.

Shortly thereafter the Cats
set the precedent for the re-
mainder of the game. Whitmire
engineered a drive to the Terrier
20 yard line where he threw a
20-yard strike to James Jones
for an apparent touchdown to
tie the score. The officials ruled
offensive interference on Jones’
part however; the score was
nullified and B.U. took over
possession. Later on the final
period Davidson came up a yard
shy of a crucial first down at teh
Boston 12-yard line. The Ter-
riers subsequently capitalized
on the Cats’ missed opportuni-
ties and iced the game away
with two fourth quarter scores.

Coach Ed Farrell encapsuled
the loss, commenting ‘“‘I don’t
think the final score was a true
indication of the talent of the
two teams. The game was more
evenly matched than the score
indicated. We had many scoring.

talize.”’

Individually, Sinclair and
Whitmire once again stood out
for the Cats. Sinclair main-
tained his Division IAA rushing
lead with a solid 143 yard on 31

his best game statistically,
hitting on 22 of 43 passes for
