Men's Tennis Faces Demanding

Schedule For New Season

By Robert Grubb

The men’s tennis team has
traditionally been one of the strong-
est teams at Davidson. Coach Jeff
Frank’s 328-158-1 record makes
him the 16th winningest active
Division I coach, and he hasnever
posted a losing record.

But Frank’s 18 season streak
may be on the line this year, as the
Wildcats face what may be their
toughest season to date.

Joining the Big South Confer-
ence puts a strain on the schedule,
because of the seven required
conference matches. Conference

play, in addition to ‘Davidson’s®

usual tough early season fare of
ACC teams and otherlarge schools
will mean that the ‘Cats will have
to play consistently well all year to
have a successful season.

“Our schedule is the hardest
we’ve ever had,” said Frank.
“We’veadded teanssfike Virginia
Commonwealth, but because of
the conference requirements we
had to drop schools like Pfeiffer
and Catawba, that we have always
done well against.”

ence play,” said Frank. “It’s easy
to get motivated to play teams like
South Carolina, and after facing
teams like.them, we won’t be in-
timidated by ateam like Campbell.”

Coach Frank's 18 season streak may be on the
line this year as the Wildctas face what may be
their toughest season to date.

The team opened the season
recently with a 9-0 defeat at the
hands of 6th-ranked South Caro-
lina, but Frank was not disap-
pointed with the team’s perform-
ance. :

“TJ didn’t really expect to win,
but the team played well today,
which is what I wanted,” he said.
The doubles matches were closer
overall than the singles, Freshmen
Ryan Harper and Russell Briggs

dropped a second set tiebreaker in °

one of the ‘Cats’ closest matches.
Said Frank, “I was really happy
with the doublesoutcomes. Harper
and Briggs came together against

‘a tough, experienced team.”

Unfortunately, there is little

schedule are Virginia and East
Carolina.
“We are using the tough early

finished first and second in the
conference last year, and will re-
tum*a majority of their lineups.
“Both of them are very talented
and they are led by good foreign
players,” said Frank.

Aside from Campbell and
Coastal Carolina, who. are un-
known quantities, the Wildcats
should be very competitive in
conference play.

Davidson defeated Radford,
which finished third in the Big
South last year, during the fall
season. If the young Wildcatlineup
doesn’t become discouraged after
the matches against the big schools,
Davidson stands an excellent
chance of finishing in the top three
in the conference.

The success of the team is
largely dependent on the play of
Davidson’s young players. The
lineup is dominated by underclass-
men, with captain Kurtis Zabell as
the only senior who will probably

see signifigant playing time. Za-
bell, who had an outstanding fall
season, will fill the number three
singles slot, and anchors the
doubles lineup, with partner John
Beyer.

“Kurtis and John are a solid
doubles combination. They play

with confidenceand justdon’t give
much away,” said Frank.

Sophomore Albie Varoski
leads the Wildcats’ singles lineup.
His play so far in spring practice

has been dominant, according to
Frank, Varoski also.teams up with
Dale Voeks to play number. three
doubles. Frank plans to put David
Jespersen and freshman Chris
Parker behind Varoski.

The tworemaining singles slots
are not definitely filled. “There are
about four guys challenging for
the five and six slots} and I want to
rotate Joey Manibo, Dave Tonidan-
del, Russell Briggs and Beyer in
the first few matches to find out
who will play,” said Frank. Briggs
and his partner, Ryan Harper, are
the number two doubles team.

The team has the potential to
have an excellent season, but
slumps by any of the key players
could have bad consequences. The
Wildcats will also have to play
solid doubles, because there will
likely be many close matches, the
results of which could hinge on the
doubles.

This is an area which Frank
has emphasized over the past two
years, and hopefully the work will
pay off.

zzFrank realizes the difficulty
of the season ahead: “We are a
young team and we have our work
cut out for us.”
