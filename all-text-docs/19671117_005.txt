Poole Directs Offense
As Cats Rip Terriers

By OON SEWELL
Sports Editor

Led by star quarterback
Jimmy Poole, Davidson's ‘Cat
football team won its last
home game Saturday, trounc-
ing Wofford 30-7. The grid.
ders put together a rugged
combination of offense and
defense to gain the victory.

Poole, ranked high all sea-
son among passers in the na-
tion, did not let down the fans
who had come to watch his
last home game. The con-
sistently effective signal-call.
er hit on 21 of 30 passes for
187 yards.

The ‘Cats’ ground game
rolled out 249 yards to com-
plete a strong offensive game.
The defense held the Terri-
ers to about 150 yards total
offense and a single touch.
down.

“We got started off well
defensively,” Coach Homer
Smith said. He cited Tupper
Morehead and Dick Lindsay
for their defensive efforts.

Davidson controlled the
play. both offensively and de
fensively, except for a period
in the third quarter when
Wofford marched 84 yards
for their score.

Among Poole’s 21 comple-
tions were scoring passes to
George Hannen and Pete
Glidewell. Running backs

Ken Hill and Kerry Keith
capped a good running day
with a touchdown apiece.
Johnny Giles added a field
goal to complete the Witdcat
scoring. However, Giles miss-
ed an extra point attempt,
the first he missed all sea-
son. Giles had come within

a few more conversions of
equaling the conference rec-
ord for consecutive conver-
sions.

“Jimmy did an exception-
ally fine job of calling plays,”’
Smith said. ‘It helped us a
great deal to have a running
offense early in the game.”

Promising "Catfish Open
Schedule With Virginia

Coach Tom Stevens’ ‘Cat-
fish open their season De.
cember 1! against the Univer-
sity of Virginia. The swim
team, though weak in some
events, should break most of
the existing school records,
Stevens said.

“Being able to use fresh
men this year will help us a
lot. We have four or five
frosh swimmers who could
be outstanding." The team
has only three seniors. cap-
tain Eddie Beach, Larry Eck-
man and Joe Friebele.

The rest of the team is
made up of sophomores and
freshmen. One of the frosh,
Jack Steele, is expected to
break school records in the
100 and 200 yard free style
events. Stevens said that
Steel could possibly become

Can’t argue with c), but before you. check

Take the belabored point that business
turns you into a jellyfish. The men who run
most of the nation’s successful firms didn’t
arrive by nepotism, by trusting an Ouija

the way, a well-modulated “No” was said.
And backed up with the savvy and guts to-

In short, individuality is highly prized in
much of the business world—the successful

This year’s practices have
been harder than ever before
because the team has better
swimmers. Stevens stressed
that swimming is a_ hard-

Stevens said that Beach is
a great leader. “He has a

The team’s time trials will
