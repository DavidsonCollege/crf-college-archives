Fesidants swarm for flushot

By DENNIS McLAWHORN
Staff Writer

The Davidson College In-
firmary administered over 600
swine flu shots to students
and employees of the college
last week, almost twice the
number expected previously.

Mrs. Dorothy Sherrill,
supervisor of the Infirmary,
commented, ‘‘We had a tre-
mendous response to the swine
flu vaccination by the stu-
dents, faculty, and staff. Our
first estimate was to give 320,
and we ended up giving 612.”

Of the persons receiving the
shots, 480 were between the

ee

ages of 18 and 24, including an
estimated 470 students. Mrs.
Sherrill said she had ‘‘no way
of knowing how many stu-
dents have had the vaccine
elsewhere,’’ but she would
hazard a guess of about 130.

If that. estimate is close to
actuality, then over 700 stu-
dents have still not had their
immunizations.

For the ones who have been
vaccinated, the concern over
reaction to the shots should be
over. There were only a few
minor cases of any reaction at
all, mainly slight fever and
chills, with no bad cases
reported.

Only one student was ad-
mitted to the Infirmary fol;
lowing his flu shot, and it-was
a mild illness, possibly not
associated with the shot at all.
The cause of some of the
sickness may have been an
intestinal virus, according to
Mrs. Sherrill.

The Infirmary supplied the
inoculations between Novem-
ber 30 and December 2, with
the whole nursing staff work-
ing overtime to run the pro-
gram.

All students, faculty, and
staff members who have taken
the vaccine should take the
second shot the week following
Christmas.

Emergency-Rescue team begins

By CATHY LANDIS
Executive Editor

Until now Davidson had
suffered from a lack of emer-
gency care. To answer this
need, students Bob Polglase
and Steve Porter have initiat-
ed the Davidson Emergency —
Rescue Service (DERS). The
emergency team, under the
direction of Dean of Students
Will Terry, provides 24 hour,
seven day a week emergency

care for students, faculty ad- [

ministration, staff, and guests
of Davidson College.

Porter outlines the proce-
dure for attaining emergency
help. ‘‘When a medical emer-
gency arises, the student
should phone the Infirmary.
He should tell the nurse where
the emergency is, and also the
nature of the problem. There
will be two on the team on all
24 hours a day, and they will
be immediately paged.”

Porter continues, ‘‘One
member will go straight to the
scene, and the other will bring
any needed’ equipment by car.
The patient will be treated on
the scene and, if necessary,
referred to the Infirmary or a
local hospital.’’

Polglase describes DERS as
a ‘‘triage function.” “We real-
ly just sort out problems and
try to channel them to the
appropriate health facility.’

chiefs of the Davidson Emergency/
Rescue Service, check respirators
and other emergency equipment.

He lists the Infirmary, Char-
lotte hospitals, and outside
doctors as available options.

“The idea behind founding
DERS,” Polglase comments,
‘is to give some consistency to
emergerncy care at David-
son.’’ Noting that many emer-
gencies were either neglected
or improperly handled becausé
of a lack of organization
among available health care
centers, Porter and Polglase
began last March to:set up a
comprehensive approach for
emergency care.

trained in emergency care and
rescue,’’ Polglase says. The
team, headed by Polglase and
Porter and assisted by Laurie
Bingaman and Tim Goodell,
will work in shifts so that two
of the four will be constantly
on call. Using the Infirmary as
the dispatcher they are equip-

ped with beepers so to be
available in all places.

In addition, the crew chiefs’
cars are equipped with every-
thing included in an ambu-
lance except a stretcher.
Polglase says, ‘‘We can supply
the same treatment as an
ambulance save for transpor-
tation. According to law we

- cannot transport patients, but

we have the North Mecklen-
burg ambulance service avail-
able if necessary.”’

When asked whether they
felt four people could handle
all, emergency care Porter
commented, “It’s going to be
tight at times, no doubt about
it. We’ll have to do a lot of
working around labs and re-
views. But,’’ he continued,
“‘most emergencies don’t occur

at class times; rather during
intramural sports and on
weekends.”’

Eventually the team would
like to expand, but the oppoe-
tunity for experience at Da-
vidson is limited. They hope to
encourage anyone who might
be interested to go to Char-

lotte to get the proper experi-
ence.

Both the Infirmary and Dr.
Elithope have given the DERS
100 percent support and coop-
eration. Terry backs the ser-
vice as will. Terry comments,
‘‘We are grateful to those
students whose interest in
improving the health care at
Davidson has made the emer-
gency service a reality. These
men and women are well—
trained and properly certified.
They are to be commended for
knowing their limitations as
well as the things they are
equipped to do.”

Polglase sums up the ser-
vice. ‘“‘The Infirmary doesn’t
make house calls; we do.
Anyone who is hurt, or too
sick to go to the Infirmary
shouldn’t hesitate to ask for
our help. Problems such as
colds, sore throats, or other
routine illnesses are best treat-
ed in the Infirmary during sick
call. But for anything out of
the ordinary, DERS is your
best source of help.”

PIRG leader states rights

By GAIL MAYNARD
Staff Writer
NC-PIRG State Director
Peter Brown was at Davidson
this week discussing landlord-
tenant relations and student

rights:
In an open session on land-
lord-tenant relationships,

Brown stated that students
have their major problems
concerning when to move and -
when to regain their deposits.
“A student’s privilege to move
depends upon the type of lease
he holds. And, of course, a
deposit belongs to the tenant.
Yet, when a tenant gets his
deposit back also depends on
the type of deposit,”

Several present at the meet-
ing had specific questions
about their landlord, Wilson
Sadler. Sadler rents houses ‘to
both college students and
townspeople. The complaints
they voiced concerned Sadler's
neglect to repair damages in
their houses.

Brown offered some solu-
tions at the meeting and

referred the students to his
North Carolina Tenants’
Handbook for other answers.
He was pleased with the ques-
tions because they led to
important explanations of ten-
ants’ rights and relations to
their landlord.

Brown stated that most
landlord-tenant relations re-
volved around maintenance of
housing. ‘‘If the housing is
allowed to decay, it affects the
economic situation in the area.
However, no laws exist which
say that a landlord must
maintain his property,” said
Brown.

Brown also said that on a
month-to-month lease, a land-
lord can evict his tenant for
any reason, with only a week’s
notice. ‘These outdated laws
stem from the feudal period,
when a landlord held complete
control over his tenants.”’

“The problems lie in know-
ing fully what tenants’ rights
are,’’ expressed Brown. He
also said that tenants are
unaware of their legal stand-

ing with a landlord.

Thus, the North Carolina
Tenants’ Handbook was com-
piled as a type of self-help tool
for tenants throughout the
state. It answers questions
about tenants’ powers to get
repairs done on housing.

Brown edited and compiled
the-handbeok, which includes
the research and writings of
PIRG students across the
state. It was distributed to
students of participating col-
leges in PIRG and also to
every tenant in North Caro-
lina.

Later, ata SGA meeting,
Brown discussed briefly a
student’s rights at a private
college. He said that these
rights centered mainly around
the contract formed between
the student and college during
application. Brown also de-
clared that today, students
consider themselves ‘‘consum-
ers’’ of education and are
demanding the rights that go
along with their consumption.
