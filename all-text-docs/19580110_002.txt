Davidson Last Year And
A Platform For 1958

If we were to label the year 1957
at Davidson with a title, surely we
would have to use the word “transi-
tion.” It was a transition that in-
volved great men and material struc-
tures as well as new ideas.

Certainly one of the most signifi-

cant changes in the life of the college.

was the death of Dr. C. K. Brown.
But like that of all other magnetic
figures, his influence will remain as
long as there remains those who
studied under him as students or
knew him as colleague or friend. In-
deed, his dedication to the college and
his contributions to his students over
the years are woven into the fabric
known as Davidson.

1957 will also be remembered as
the year that Dr. Cunningham stepped
down as head of the college he served
so well. His whole administration
was marked by a series ef successful
efforts to improve the physical face of
the campus. Our more than adequate
facilities are a tribute to his work and
vision. His loyal interest and moral
character have been an inspiration and
a standard for the entire college com-
munity.

Another familiar face, Dr. Samuel
Spencer, left Davidson to become pres-
ident of Mary Baldwin. We expect
that as the years go on. his accom-
plishments in the field of education
will bring more honor and pride to
this institution.

1957 was also the year of the great
flu wave, of the Pi Kapp fire, and
of additional students due to the
Trustee’s decision to increase the en-
rollment.

Brighter Spots

Fortunately. the vear also saw some
bright spots. On the positive side,
we saw the successful fight to grant
the A.B. degree to all non-science
majors. The year also saw the
groundbreaking for a new wing to the
library, a new post office, Dr. Cun-

ningham’s ‘‘Ten Year Plan,” the four
new clocks, and a reaffirmation of the
fraternity system with the approval of
the new half million dollar fraternity
court. ,

In the field of human endeavor, we
saw Dr. Pietenpol, Dean Bailey, and

Mr. Martin, as well as the rest of the |

college staff, keeping the wheels of
the college turning in their usual
excellent manner. The fact that the
college is doing wonderfully well with-
out an official president is a pat on
the back for their fine leadership.

These were some of the more signi-
ficant events of 1957. What will 1958
bring forth?

Platform For 1958

1958 seems destined to bring both
bad and good. It will bring more
students as the increased enrollment
plan continues. It will also bring the
12th president of Davidson College
These two events will happen as a
matter of course.

But the New Year should also see
the realization of other goals. The
DAVIDSONIAN’S platform for a bet-
ter Davidson includes:

1. Adoption of the “preferential
bidding” system to limit the size of
fraternities:

2. Acceptance of a more mature
attitude toward “Hell Week.”

3. Elimination of Section 3 of
article IX of the Student Body Con-
stitution to permit students to return
to the campus after they have been
drinking.

4 Rivision of the college curricu-
lum to revitalize the required courses
and to consolidate and improve the
present curriculum.

5. Elimination of compulsory’Com- ,;

munion Vespers.

6 Reversal of the Trustee's decision
to increase the size of the student
body.

Wanted:
Action

Before the Christmas holidays, a
DAVIDSONIAN poll revealed that a
great majority of the students are dis-
Satisfied with the present drinking
rule. Action to change the rule, more-
over, can come from two sources: the
Student Council or from the students
in the form of a petition.

The initiative, however, logically
lies with the Student Council since
they are elected to handle the legis-
lative affairs of student government.
As yet the council has been unwilling
to initiate any definite proposal to
change the rule. What are they wait-
ing on—for the students to do what
the council ought to do?

It would be an unfortunate reflec-
tion on the Student Council if they
missed this chance to show some posi-
tive leadership in student life on the
campus. If the council doesn't do
something soon, perhaps interested
students wil! assume the leadership
by submitting a petition for. an amend-
ment to the student body constitution.

Preferential Bidding Is Proposed

In keeping with the new fra-
ternity court and the new sys-
tem for rushing, it is appropri-
ate now to consider with a fresh
and unbiased outlook the make-
up of the fraternities. Are our
fraternities now the best pos-
sible size for real spirit? Is the

College Crisis:
Highest Bid

By BOB JONES

Only extremely partisan ob-
servers of the Davidson scene
seriously contend that the col-
lege exercises the highest aca-
demic standards. This type of
comment, of course, is not com-
monly made by “caffein tiber-
als’ in their critiques of Da-
vidson.

SUNORY WEAKNESSES

The curriculum, the faculty,
and the student body can all
be picked over for sundry weak-
nesses, In making criticisms,
however. it is well to bear in
mind the overall trend in Ameri-
can undergraduate education.
Numerous sources inform us
that there is an incipient crisis
in college education.

While the crisis is currently
pressuring Davidson, the offect
will become considerably more
acute in the immediate future.

* BASICALLY ECONOMIC

Whatever more extraneous
factors one might decide to in-
clude, requisite for a good col-
lege are good professors and
good students. The problem of
obtaining these two groups to
maintain a truly reputable col-
lege is. basically economic.

LETTER TO EDITOR

“No Pressure

Dear Editor,

1 suppose that we've about
worried this Conformity thing
to death, but before we do let's
look at it in one more way.
The following consists of the
impressions of an out-of-state
Freshmen gathered in three
months at Davidson.

Here there is little or no
pressure to conform to pop-
ular ways of thought. A De
vidson man is credited with
intelligence and moral re-
sponsibility and his right to
his own opinion end beliefs
is acknowledged.

It is probably difficult for
a nerson who has been here for
some time to appreciate the
intellectual freedom predomin-
ant at Davidson. Granted, in the
Southwest clothing, manners.
and customs are definitely not
static. However, they change
rapidly according to fads, an
evidence of the lack of originali-
ty on the part of the majority.

PUBLIC OPINION
Furthermore, intellectual and

program the best for the school
as a whole, or is it just dog-
eat-dog with each group trying
to hurt the other more than it
itself is getting hurt.
Assuming that a smaller
size would lead to better
chapter spirit, and that the

professors and students are up
for sale to the highest bidder.

An example is found in the
competition for capable stu-
dents. The leading schools have
sufficient funds to provide gen-
erous scholarships in addition to
the allure of a great “name.”

‘BEST BID

A school that desires to at-
tract talented students must be
able to make the best bid, which
includes. in addition to various
intangibles, money to pay the
students to attend.

While at Davidson the faculty
and administration are general-
ly aware of these problems and
needs, the Board of Trustees
and the student body apparent-
ty are femoved from the prac-
tical, economic requirements of
a first rate school. It must be
realized by all who are inter-
ested in the future of Davidson,
however.

in tong range plans it is
necessary to recognize that the
foremost consideration in -build-
ing a better Davidson is suf-
ficient economic resources and
wise management.

To Conform”

moral freedom is simply non-
existent. Individuality and sen-
sitivity are crushed by public
opinion or, in extreme cases,
by political or economic pres-
sure.

Here at Davidson a man is
free to disagree with the ma-
jority even in such an important
issue as segregation. As I have
said, these are first impressions,
perhaps naive or erroneous; but
they are strong impressions. If
they are correct, they form the
basis for a more optimistic out-
look on conformity at Davidson.

ding or quote system.

This plan would have both
bidding and pledging handled
through the IFC. Rather than
bidding all boys with an equal-
ly definite bid—those. they real-
ly want lumped together with
those they bid as second string
fillers to get the necessary
quantity—the fraternities would
list, say, the five boys they are
the most interested in, then the
second five, the third, and so
on.
Thus. the fraternities would
have ‘a list of their preferences,

‘which would be turned over to

the IFC. Each rushee would al-

so make out a list of his fra-

ternity choices, in order of pre-
ference. With these two sets
of lists. the IFC could then
combine the preferences list-
ed in both as well as possible
according to fixed regulations.
QUOTA SYSTEM

The idea of the quota sys-
tem would come in at this point:
the fraternities would be given
boys up to a set quota, say
twenty. If its first twenty
choices chose it as first, they
would be assigned accordingly.
If its first fifteen worked out
thus. the remaining five would
be assigned according to the
highest possible correlation, as
detailed in the IFC regulations
on this selection.
The rushee's preference
would perhaps be given
more weight than the fra-
ternity’s, provided he was
not more than a certain dis-
tance below the last corre-
lated case, in which event
the  fraternity’s higher
choice would be correlated
with a slightly lower rushee.
The details on this program
would have to be worked out
to the satisfaction of everyone.
but the basic plan would be
that given here. The preferen-
tial bidding plan should elimin-
ate some of our present prob-
lems such as bidding for quan-
tity and what to do with the
rushee who makes neither good
nor bad impression. ~
MORE EVEN DISTRIBUTION

The quota system plan. which
would be a necessary aspect of
the preferential bidding one.
would help keen the fraternities
small enough for real fellow-
ship, would kecp them fitted to
the space in the new houses,
and would offer the smaller fra-
ternities some hope of building
up to the larger. Together, they
would settle the worries about
the number coming down on
pledge day, and should help
to some extent the unequal dis-
tribution of quality among the
fraternities.

In the game of life you are losing the initiative when
